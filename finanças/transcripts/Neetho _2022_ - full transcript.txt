Meghana, I didn't really mean that. No Varun! You did, didn't you? -Are we here already? -Wait, wait... Cool, cool! What will you tell her now? As if she would listen to him. I will confess everything I have to, whether she cares or not. That's alright, buddy. But how are you going to say? When I failed to convey things I was supposed to share it with someone I don't even know how to start now. How do I make you understand? Enough! Just go and burst out.

He should be here by now. Wait, let me just check with him once. Policy worth 2 crores! I doubt if it's an arranged marriage or love marriage. Is yours an arranged marriage or... Sorry! What were you saying? Nothing, I just wanted to know if yours is... ... an arranged marriage or you know... I mean, you are paying a lot for the insurance, so... Would you ask the same question to every client? What! I mean to say... If their marriage is arranged or... Well, generally I do ask that. But... Just to know how long their relationship lasts. So... According to you, love marriage lasts longer or... ...or arranged marriages? How does it matter? A wedding is a wedding irrespectively. Then what's the point of asking that question? I mean... Depending on their answers... I mean, we can get a basic idea based on the way they answer. What do you mean by "the way"? So, basically 70 percent of the marriages in India are arranged marriages, right? But, looking at global list, India holds the position of least divorce cases. But divorce cases in India have increased lately. That's what I've heard. I don't know. Yeah, maybe. But... Considering the least divorce rate, I am sure, there's some math working out. I didn't get your point. Well... When people approach me for insurance... if they pretend saying it's an arranged marriage, inspite of being in love... it shows that they're just concerned about people's opinions on them. Okay... And then what? But, if they try to prove that it's a love marriage even though it's arranged... It means that they really love each other a lot. They really like each other, you know. Well... I guess. It's not always the case. You're right. So... Yours is a love marriage or an arranged marriage? Love cum arranged marriage. Relax! As you have clearly explained the question, I'll give an elaborate answer too. Thanks, ma'am! I'm really curious now. So, Mr. Satya, my fiancee he contacted you, right? I liked him first. Actually, it was me who got connected to him first when I was little disturbed. Wow! That's great. The moment our parents got to know about us, they've blindly decided to get us married before we could think. Wow! You guys are so lucky man! What's so 'lucky' about it? My dad's into pharmacy... And Mr. Satya's dad is into imports and exports business. So they have an understanding, which I'm not really aware of. Pharmacy! Imports and Exports! Superb! Excuse me! I'm not marrying Mr. Satya because of their business. We like each other genuinely, so we're getting married. I meant, both are from business families, so there wouldn't be a problem, right? But, it's not the case with everyone, right? Why, was there too much of emotional drama... with the family around your wedding? Not with the family though. Oh, it's your girl then! Superb! By the way, how's she with you after marriage? Oh No! I'm not married yet. But I should get married soon. You really like her. Don't you? Yes. See, even you got this. But she isn't able to. Why! What is she saying? If I knew, I would've told you right? By the way, what's her name? And where does she work? Or is she planning to start interior design business, or waiting for opportunities, just like me? No... She's not that lucky. She's into marketing. Oh! That's good! That's awesome! What's good in there Ma'am? Being in marketing job, she's using all her skillset against me. Until recently, I thought convincing people to take policy was most difficult. But, to convince a girl to marry! -That's a more challenging task! -What do you mean? People shoot me with so many queries while applying for a policy, right... But Anusha irritates me with more questions than everyone. -I didn't bother you with policy, right. -Not at all I'm just generalizing, that's it. [mobile ringing] Just a second! -Hello -Yes, hello. Sir, ma'am arrived a while ago. When can I expect you sir? Yes, I would... I would take some time to come. Take her signatures and leave, okay? Okay sir. He said he would take time to come. Okay, then let's just go ahead with the paperwork. -Please sign it wherever indicated. -Yeah! I'm sorry, I didn't get your name. Mr. Satya shared just your contact number. It's Varun. Hello Varun! Meghana, right? So, bye Varun. If you need documents further, let me know. My company would accept any kind of document for the premium you paid. Sure, right? Because, I don't want to keep coming here again that's why. Yes, I'm pretty sure. Varun, I need a favour. Yes, tell me. Can you please ask Mr. Satya the same question you asked me? What? I'm curious to know if he would say that ours is a love marriage or arranged. No Meghana! It's just my stupid theory! How could you believe it? Come on please, I'm asking you a small favour. It's quite important to me. Okay! Her fiancee will have a tough time. What's happening? We aren't going to reach our targets even this month, right? Yes, we're almost there. By the way... Did you inform Pooja? That, you may lose your job. Are they paying our salaries for the past 3 years without us working? It's not about what we were doing for the past three years It only matters, what we're doing now. Not just them... Even Pooja is concerned about the same. They don't care about past achievements And they speak about company responsibilities, ethics and their values. Leave that aside. You were present in the meeting, right? Don't you remember? They clearly mentioned that, if at all we don't reach our targets, ... this month,they will definitely fire us. That's what man! I got a client now. Huge money is involved, okay! Our jobs are sorted. Who is the client though? My uncle's employers' son is getting married... Did you finish the paperwork? Yes, I will get it done soon. Is this a "Couple Insurance Plan" by any chance? Yes! How did you know that! Forget it! Make sure that they don't call off the wedding... Else, you will end up like Ravi. What happened with him? I had a similar case before, I approached, when they said it's a business family... they asked me to make few changes in the document and I have done it too. In the end eventhough, bridegroom was replaced both policy and wedding were called off. No man, I'm sure this won't end up like yours. This girl is very confident about it. We are sorted. Oh, Really! Did you try to threaten her saying that we would lose our jobs if they call off her wedding? He might have told. No, I haven't told her anything. But I would, when the time comes. By the way, As we see, me and him are unmarried, so we both can still get away with unemployment But you can't under perform like us, right Ravi? You are a married man Ravi, okay! You guys will be married soon! You get it? -So, shut up! -You have no responsibility Ravi. I pity your wife. What if you lose your job? He's least bothered about his girlfriend, but trying to sympathize your wife. I have been performing with constant encouragement she's been giving me. Oh is it? Did she stop giving you Encouragement now? She said that she would give me a divorce. What! Divorce... She said she wants a divorce! You always encourage me to leave Pooja for good, right? Try leaving your wife, it might work in your favour too! I don't know if it does any good. If I lose this job... My life's completely gone into the drain. In that case, you don't have to waste time convincing her. She would be happy to get divorced. What's with this divorce suddenly? Do you have an illegal affair which we aren't aware of? You're talking about me! No way! She just put on a little weight. -Yeah, so? -So? So, as I never complained or commented that she gained weight... She started believing that I lost interest and stopped loving her. Thus, she had decided to leave me and go. When is she planning to leave? To be frank, your wife is more stupid than our girlfriends. Don't you dare call her stupid! You have to respect her, damnit! I'll definitely see how would you manage to convince your girlfriends to marry. Considering this bloody job situation, I shall definitely see. shall see, your action and their reaction too. By the way... What's up with that client meeting? I don't know whose ill-fate it is. It just didn't work out. Please take good care of the client. Just a sec. Hello? Varun, I'm done with my work. Where are you right now? I'm at office. Where else do you expect? Shall we go out? No, I have a meeting now. Would you care to listen if I was busy? Did I even complain about it now? You would start complaining eventually. If you have already assumed what I would say, there would be nothing left for me to speak. Didn't it bother you when you did the same to me? It's different, Anusha. Why so? I have a logic which you don't. That's it. Hello! I make sense and you don't. Hey Anusha, my client is here. I will call you later, okay? Bye. Fine, alright. Bye! -Hello! -Hello. Yes sir, please tell me. Dude, I'm out now. Can you please come here? I will share you the location. You can just drop down. Oh, is it? Okay sir, no problem. -Hey Satya! -Hello Your father asked me to come to office tomorrow. Yes... Please come, okay! You should spend tomorrow with me, okay? Yes, Meghana. We'll finish shopping first, okay? -Finish your insurance work today. -Yes, I know. We'll finish the wedding chores by month end. -True. -Ah okay! Did you meet Varun? That's going on. Yeah... Oh that's cool then. Bye Oh, hi! What's up! Aren't you too early? -I'm sorry, sir. -Have a seat. I'm sorry man, I was stuck in a meeting. No sir, that's okay. Sorry for being late. And how much time is this going to take? Not too long, sir. If you don't want to read Terms and conditions... There's no need of all this. Your uncle, Mr. Shivanand had already informed my dad... that you are the right person for this policy. Like... it's going to be in safe hands. So, it doesn't really matter to me whatever it is. This policy is highly important for us sir, please. Well, I'm glad I'm helping you out. -Thank you so much, sir. -Okay, so what do I do now? -Please sign wherever it's indicated. -Okay. Thank you. Yes, you were telling me... -Please sign in the boxes indicated. -Okay. You're with Mr. Satya, right? Please ask him and... and let me know if he said ours is and love marriage or an arranged one. Sir, is yours a love marriage or an arranged marriage? It's a love marriage, but... Why are you asking? Is the number too high for love marriage? No sir, I was just curious. That's it. Okay! Meghana, you are really lucky. You don't have to worry about a thing. Mr. Satya likes you a lot. You guys are really made for each other. Is it for real, Varun? You serious? Bullshit! As if it's a match made in heaven! No Meghana, it's true. Trust me. Thank you, Varun. If you need any help with your girlfriend, Anusha... Please let me know. I would definitely do it. Sure. Done. Goodnight! Okay, goodnight. Ah, why is he going through all terms and conditions! -Done, bro. -Thank you, sir. -Varun! -Sir. Just in case, in near future, if our wedding is called off... Is there any possibility that Meghana's family could sue me and my family? Just asking. Because, Meghana's dad is paying for all this. Sir, you might face an issue if yours is an arranged marriage, I mean, after coming so far... And moreover, you said it's a love marriage, right? Apart from Meghana, no one else considers this as love marriage, Varun. Not just her father, but no one in her family consider it too. Oh! Pardon sir, I didn't get you. Varun, Meghana's father didn't agree due to our relationship He accepted it considering their business deal and... to be honest, he tried to convince my dad too. Then why did you accept, sir? I seriously have no idea why did I accept it in first place. Sir, is there any possibility that wedding would be called off? Chill, that's not going to happen. Don't worry. I'll make sure that your policy is completed. Okay. -Actually Varun, I'm getting late. -Oh! -So, I'll make a move. -Okay, sir. -Goodnight. -Goodnight! Yes Mr. Sandeep, did you get an update? UNCLE! -Hello! -Yes, uncle. Did you meet Mr. Satya? I met him, but... But what? Tell me. He's skeptical about the wedding, uncle. Don't take his words seriously. At the end of the day, he has to obey his father. What did your boss say? My boss said that, this wedding will definitely happen. That's the reason I spoke to him and referred you. Uncle, you do know how important this policy is to me. My job is based on this entirely. I'm worried if they would call off the wedding. There's no need to worry about your job. We'll try, do something to manage. Yeah, will do... By the way, when are you coming to my place? I will come soon. What would we do anyway? You will keep cribbing about your wife and your love story. Or you keep complaining that people misunderstand you. Promise Varun, I won't utter a word about that. -Okay? -Okay. I wonder what is she doing now. Let me call her. I guess she's offended. I cut her call abruptly, right! Let me try again. These girls and their tantrums! Mom! What are you doing? Varun. Did Anusha accept your marriage proposal? Let me know if she didn't. Do you want me to look out for a better girl? It's not about that, mom. If there's anything, I'll let you know, right? Anyway, I would never aceept your choice of girls, okay! Why do you say that? What's wrong with my choices? In spite of waiting for her since so long, and if she's still not ready to accept, maybe, she doesn't like you in first place. It's not that, mom. She said she would take a decision based on my job and career growth, That's it. Give her some time. So, you mean to say... If you lose your job tomorrow, she would leave you for someone. Why are you still holding on to such girl? Listen! I think you will end up marrying the girl I choose for you. Mom! Anusha is a practical girl, okay! You wouldn't understand. Leave it. By the way... What's dad doing? He's busy watching T.V What else do you expect! He's more interested in global issues than what we have at home. Why? Did something happen again? Nothing as such. The usual stuff between me and your aunt. Alright. Please take care of yourself. [mobile keypad tapping] So... All set for the wedding? Yes, all set! By the way, what are you gifting me? I still remember the day I got married and left my home. What? Your grandmother was very sad when I was leaving, maybe, because I was getting married and going away. -But... -But? But now I'm able to understand as you're getting married. Even you are going to leave and alienate us, right? I understand, mom. What's the big deal! I'm not going to leave my hometown after marriage, like you did, right? Giving it a thought, now I realize... Marriages were for the sake of family's prestige back then, But now, it's just for family's business these days. I wish grandmother was with us today. Meghana, tell me honestly, are you happy with this marriage proposal? Come on mom! Ofcourse, I have accepted this wedding proposal willingly. God knows! Everything is happening in the blink of an eye, right! So, I thought you were hesitant to share it even though you wanted to. Don't you worry about it, mom. I'm even throwing a party to Keerthi and Usha, you see. Didn't your dad warn you not to tell anyone about the wedding? I invited only those who already know. Who all know about it, by the way? Who else... Other than my two friends, the guy who's working on the policy also knows. What! Is he invited to the party too? No mom, he is not even my friend. I never spoke to him after that day. That's alright then. Hello! -Hello Varun! -Yes, sir. -Are you done with the work? -Yes... I'm done with work, I'll share the documents soon. Varun, I don't think this is working out. What's wrong, sir? How can you cancel at this moment, sir? This policy is quite important for your company. I don't need your damn policy! -Excuse me! -Yes? -Are you an insurance policy agent? -Y-Yes sir... Okay okay! Sir, I can get you any policy done. No, I don't need any policy. Sir! Insurance is mandatory for every living being, right sir! Is it? Insurance policies are subjected to ...so many clauses, terms and conditions, sir! This policy will help you solve any such life problem. It can help you out when you meet with any accident, such as fire accidents... ... or it would help you with any such mishap, sir. It will support you, if you're diagnosed with cancer or malaria or whatever, sir. It will help you to make your marriage and also helps when you break your marriage too sir. Who gets an insurance done for a wedding, man? People get it done due to uncertainity in their relationship or marital life. If the policy is that mandatory for a wedding I am highly skeptical about it. Guys like you, would need insurance first. -Hello? -Hello! Where are you? Anusha, I'm working on an insurance policy... Are you not meeting me? I-I am coming. Amidst of my mess, she's least bothered. You know what! We both started our careers at the same time. Yes, what a coincidence, right? But the same coincidence couldn't get translated in our career graph. Why do you say that? What happened now? Layoffs are going on in your company now And you didn't even tell me. And you are trying to escape by avoiding me. No, Anusha. There's nothing like that. I'll take care of it, right? I will take care of my job. I got a policy now, okay! Everything will be sorted. Are you really sure this policy would definitely work in your favour? And if your job is safe? What are you trying to prove exactly, Anusha? Well, those hurdles which I had to cross... Those situations which I had to go through... I don't want my future family to go through the same. So? So... If I've to marry, I want to settle down with a well-settled family. And not with a working class family. Why? Because, I clearly have an idea of how my life should be. And I would want to lead my life the way I planned. Anusha! I wanna know! If you could tell me your plans ahead... I can try, right? I can do something about it. If we can... If we can come to a middleground, right? Okay! You wanna know? Well, listen then! -Yeah! I don't want to live in a rented house. I want to a have home for my own. I want to have servants in my home. Basically, I want to have a comfortable marital life, which I missed experiencing since childhood. Is that a sin? Anusha? One more thing... Do you really believe that you're independent and self-made? Yes! You don't think so? Whatever luxuries you have dreamt of, Are those truly your desires? Yes, so what is your problem? It's not my problem, okay. Then? If you really wanted to fulfill your desires... and the independency which you dreamt of... All these things... You could have earned the same studying at IIT or a top institution, Why are you waiting for someone to come change your life? W-Why all this! Are you done! Anusha! Are you pointing all this just because I may lose my job? In Case... Even if you have a job... I don't know. I mean, I'm really not sure. Wow! Thank you, Anusha! Now I feel way better, okay. By the way, is the wedding happening at the same venue you planned for? Yes. I've checked the place. It's good. Check the photos. Meghana, where are you? I'm at a party, mom! Come home immediately. Why mom? What happened? You didn't inform anyone about the wedding, did you? No, but why? Nothing... Don't worry about it. I won't tell anyone till dad's business deal is done. -Is that okay? -Okay. You please come home immediately. Okay, bye. So, yeah. I'll also share the menu I planned, please check it out. Okay! Hello, Meghana! Where are you? I'm with Usha and friends. Why? You didn't inform anyone about our wedding, did you? Satya, what's wrong with you! I didn't tell anyone. Okay, I'll be there. We need to talk. We're having our dinner. I'll be there by the time you finish your dinner. I need to talk to you personally, Meghana. -Okay. -Bye. You guys, please leave soon. Looking at her, I think she's going to head to honeymoon directly from here. Honeymoon! Alright. I have to go to studio. -We'll go then -We'll leave, you have fun. Yeah! -Bye, Meghana! -Bye! Oh God! Satya is already here. -Hi -Hey, Meghana. What's wrong with you? I haven't informed anyone about our wedding. I was waiting for you to get done with your work. Tomorrow is your meeting, right? Meghana, your father isn't ready for this meeting. He's not happy with the deal as well. He's refusing to come to office. Why? What went wrong? You should somehow convince your father and send him tomorrow, okay? Yes, I will... But tell me, what's wrong? Thank you man! Like... Thanks a lot, Meghana! Would you like some dessert? I ordered it for you. Okay, anyway... Tell me what happened. Meghana. You do know this right. I come from a business family. You come from a business family as well. So, we have our business responsibilities on our shoulders. N-No, we started as a working class family, before getting into business. Yeah, whatever! But, it won't change the facts. We still have to carry our responsibilities, so... So? Well... Look... We both never expected that we would get married. Our families took a decision... and convinced us to get married. But, you have accepted the proposal, right? Yeah. But... I don't think that it just takes two of us to believe that we're in love. But, our families believe it too, and that's the reason they want us to get married. I'm not denying that. What I mean to say is... They made a decision based on their business deal. And... What I'm trying to say is... We shouldn't go ahead with marriage just based on that. I prioritize my family and family's business over anything. I have been that person since day one, and you have known me for years now. Y-Yes... So? I don't get it. Meghana. We ourselves weren't sure about our relationship, right? We have accepted this only due to family's peer pressure... Do you think anyone else would consider us as a couple? They have known us for years now, right? What are you saying! What happened suddenly! You want someone else to validate our relationship, is that it? Hold on! Meghana, listen to me. It's not about that. What am I trying to say is... We shouldn't get married if we are unsure about it. Varun, answer the call! -Hello? -Hello, Varun! You were sure right, that me and Satya are made for each other. Hey! Listen! Mr. Satya doesn't like you at all! He's just getting married for sake of his family. You're so dumb that you are still hanging on to him. He is least interested in you, okay! Look! Don't you dare calling or texting me ever again. He's not in love with you, man. Leave him! Just... Don't disturb me, okay? Goodbye! Meghana? You see? Apart from us, I don't see anyone believing in us as a couple. To be frank, he is right. Satya, I just have a question. Meghana, I'm sorry. We can always be good friends. I don't want to be friends with you. I can't be friends with someone I have loved. I understand. Oh, you understand. Great. I have ordered this for you, since you like it. Meghana. I will take care of it. Just leave it. I was just celebrating with friends about our wedding. So, it's okay. Don't worry about it. Meghana, just listen to me. I know it's not happening the way it should and... I am really sorry. I mean it. I am really sorry. -Good Morning, sir. -Please come in. Good Morning. You have been very consistent, Varun. What's wrong, sir? You failed to reach your targets for the past three months. Sir... I have got a big client for policy. I think I will definitely reach my targets this time, sir. You always failed to keep up your word, Varun. So, you sure that you have no issues with the policy. Sir... Definitely, sir! The management gave up on us due to their losses. They're looking forward to remove old staff and hire new people. And I can't do anything about it. Sir, please. You do know our situation, sir. See! If at all you lose your job now... It's going to be really tough considering all your pending loans. I am worried about the same, sir. You got it, right? Inform your friends too. And try to save your jobs at all costs. Sir, please make it work and save our jobs. Okay! I will see. Thank you, sir. Thank you so much. Varun, did you also get a mail from Assessment team? It's a bit too much. This mail looks like a warning to fire us from jobs. It's not a warning, we are almost fired! What are you saying? Dude? Seriously? So Ravi's divorce is on cards then. Is that really important now? Forget about his divorce. Anusha just gave up on me lately. Without a doubt! Say what? Our jobs are important than my breakup now. Yes, absolutely! Job is more important than Anusha. Leave that aside. Our client is sure about it right? Did you finish the paperwork? What! I-I messed it up. -What went wrong, man? -What happened! Mr. Satya doesn't like you at all! You're so dumb that you are still hanging on to him. Look! Don't you dare calling or texting me ever again. Just don't disturb me, okay! What! Are you stupid! Damn! Why do you care if their love is real or fake? I just realized it lately. Great realization, I say! Damn! I just blabbered over frustration on Anusha, I'm sorry. Hey! Looks like your frustration and break up would lead to my divorce. How can you be so stu... Calm down! Shit man! Hey, Ravi! What now? Did you try to find out the situation there? I have no clue. Then! Call him now! Call whom? Who else can it be? It's Mr. Satya. He is the one who approached you, right? Yeah! It's switched off. In that case... Your uncle would know if there was any problem, right? Yes -Yeah! -I know right! -Call him then. Yes, Varun. Tell me. Hello Uncle, where are you? -I just reached office. By the way, you are getting the policy done, right? Yes, I'm on it, so? What's wrong with you? The business meeting between my boss and girl's father is going on right now. Oh, so the weddding is still on, right? Are you mad! Why would they call off? Uncle, are they really happy? Ofcourse, they're happy. They're getting profit of 100 million each. I'm not talking about their business, it's about the wedding. What's wrong with you? Are you drunk? Uncle, Mr. Satya's phone is switched off. Oh, he might be busy with his wedding chores. Alright, uncle. Everything seems fine. If I knew who that guy was, I would screw his happiness. Who are you talking about? That policy guy! He knew that Mr. Satya was not serious. Yet, he didn't inform you? Even you guys never told me anything, right? He is not even my friend. Why would he? Oh God! -What? Mr. Satya is in Goa, as if nothing had happened. See! They finished off their company contracts, right. Why would he even bother now? I think we should stop bothering and move on. Let's click a selfie. Post something. Good idea! Come, Meghana. Come on smile! Come on smile! -Yeah! Sorry, Meghana. Okay now! Enough! Smile! Hell with these EMIs She might be busy. Her wedding is fast approaching. Hey Varun! Your Meghana was here in the party yesterday. Is Meghana your friend? My friend's friend. A friend's friend? Pooja's friend is Meghana's friend too. Any more doubts? Okay, it's none of my business... -What we need is just information. -Which information? Any wedding constitutes of many different works, Everybody posts just like this about their every wedding related activity. So, you have to find where she is and then just go talk to her. If I go, Meghana would kill me. What do you expect! If you don't go, we'll kill you. What do you expect! [cicadas chirping] She roamed around the whole city to finally land here. Meghana! Meghana, wait! Meghana, please... Don't take my words seriously. Don't take anything seriously. You guys are really made for each other, okay! -Meghana, I didn't really mean that. -No, Varun. You did. Didn't you? Well, maybe, I must have meant it. But... I am genuinely sorry. You don't have to take my words seriously. I don't make sense from what I talk most of the time. Please don't stop taking the policy considering what I spoke. Mr. Satya's phone isn't reachable. I guess he is busy. He's celebrating bachelor's party in Goa, right... I thought so... I thought he would be busy. If possible, try to finish the policy work this week itself. That should be enough. Is that enough? You would be busy later... You have to invite people... Send wedding invitations... You will not have any trouble. So, you suppose there would be no trouble. Yeah! Huh! Meghana? The reason I didn't inform you because... ...that day, when we spoke on phone... I just had a breakup. Actually, I thought it was because of my job. But I realized that she doesn't like me in first place. So, I just bursted out in my frustration. That's it. My friends aren't like me. They have serious relationships. And... This job is very important for all three of us. If we have to survive in this job, then... ...this policy is very important to us. So please try to do something and sign the policy. I don't know why... I don't remember what other people spoke about Mr. Satya, but... I can only remember what you spoke about him. Meghana, I'm really sorry. By the way... Are you done with your wedding chores? -Are you done with shopping? -Yeah! -Everything is done. -Okay! Nice! Hello? Hey Varun! Can you hear me? -Yes, Uncle! -Varun! Meghana's wedding is called off. Ah shucks! Is it! You please come home. We'll discuss it. Meghana! How come Meghana's wedding got called off, Uncle? The thing is... Both the families have no issues with their business affairs. I'm not talking about their business, Uncle. Hey Varun! What happened now? Why are you so irritated now? God knows! It's troubling me more about Meghana's break-up than my own. You are not distressed about her breakup or about her. It's your job that is making you worry. Hmm. Maybe. Forget it now, whether you have your job or not, it doesn't matter. Your girlfriend always reminded me of my wife, your beloved aunt. And I always feared that you would end up like me. Atleast, losing your job is far more better than this scenario. By the way... -What are you planning to do now? -What else can I do? I should go personally and persuade Meghana again. Do I have an option, uncle? Whatever you say... Yes? She should like you first. But for what? To help you... To understand your situation. And to think about your job too. If she doesn't, then? Consider that you are fired! She never understands her situation Meghana! Look at our latest collection. All of them are added just now. I'm so excited. -One sec! -What happened? Why would she bother about me or my job? What if she is concerned? Varun, don't tell my friend that you are the policy guy. Okay. What happened? -Why are you here? -The papers... Papers... Okay, later! Yeah! Keerthi! He's an old friend. He is getting married, so... -Hello! -Hi! He is here to buy some stuff for home. Yeah, sure. Please. Just pretend that you are shopping for your future home, okay? -Umm! -Yes? I need to ask you something. Did you inform anyone else about my wedding? What do you mean? Excluding the people who know, did you inform anyone else? No, not at all. You're sure, right? Because I don't want anyone else to know No, I'm absolutely sure. -What about your colleagues? -Oh! They just know about the policy. That's it. Fine, I'll never talk about the wedding again. You also don't talk about it. Hey, Meghana! One more thing. What! I would've tried to convice you to get the policy done somehow. But as your wedding called off, I didn't know how would you react I mean... Your father... He spent a lot of money on your wedding and... Now that it's called off, I was... Hey, Hello! What can I do to make you stop talking about that wedding? This policy... What's with the policy? My friends are in dire need of this job. Just for their sake... And what about you? I'm in need too. So? Meghana, If you can just wait for a month, I will get your policy cancelled somehow. I didn't get your point. Meghana, these policy papers are mandatory for us to survive in the job. And... We need your signature on these policy papers. I'll do something and try to cancel your policy within a month. I can assure you that, okay! Okay! I still have no idea what you're talking about, Varun. Relax! Please explain what happened. Meghana, as your wedding is cancelled... I was skeptical about your state of mind... And I don't like the fact that I'm troubling you for the policy. I had a breakup the other day... ...and I blabbered nonsense. I am really sorry for that. Despite everything... You were kind enough. Receptive towards me. You could have kicked me out of here, right! Just because of this... I don't want you to... I don't want to trouble you anymore but I can't put my friends job at risk. Is that it! Hmm, yeah! So I just have to sign the papers to continue the policy. -That's it right? -Yes, that's it. Okay, how much do I pay? Look, my dad is not as rich as he seems to be. -Yes, he already paid for it. -Oh! Cool! Why did she pause again! Varun, I don't want Mr. Satya's name here. That can be done. I will take care of it. -Change that and bring it to me. -Okay. If your problem was that serious, you should've informed in prior. I didn't expect you to react like this, Meghana. I would've informed, if I was aware of this. Excuse me! I have no interest in listening to your problems. It's not just you... I have no interest in my problems either. What happened, Varun!

Don't do it. No, Varun. You are not calling her. No! By the way... Why do I feel like talking to Meghana! Maybe... Maybe because I couldn't thank her enough. Is it necessary to call her and tell? A text message would do, right! Varun, just listening to your name would haunt her past. Is this really necessary? She wants to move on, man. Let her move on, Varun. There's no need to do anything now. Just shut up and sleep. You have office, tomorrow. Are you in your teenage? You're behaving like a college kid. Society would laugh at you, man. What do you think about yourself? Though you try to explain, she won't get it, she's dumb. So just forget and sleep, man. Varun, You are not going to call her. Let her call if she wants. I didn't want anybody to know about this. People are judging that we'd do anything just to save our business Savitri. I expected this to happen! Inspite of that, I kept asking her... She said she was sure, whenever I asked her. What can we do about it now! They liked each other. Dad, will you stop talking about it? Please! Why are you blaming us now? You might be the reason, everyone got to know about this. Do you have any concern towards us? What if people think we've accepted the proposal for sake of our business? We have accepted the proposal for you, isn't it? Why are you blaming me for something I haven't done? You should have informed us in prior. That you both are not serious about it. I wouldn't have dragged it so far. I have no clue who all are aware of this. No one is aware about it. So don't worry. That policy guy! Even he's aware of this, right? Yes he does, so what? -Wait! -Meghana! First of all, I have to take care of this. I have paid money for it too. Which money? What are you talking about? For the policy! Dad, why are you worried about that now? I must contact them. I know! I will talk to them. By the way... No one else is aware of this except our family. How did outsiders come to know about it? You are only worried about people getting to know about it rather than being concerned that it was my wedding, indeed. It's not that, Meghana! Don't overthink about it. I will be fine. Go and talk to her. Meghana! Come on dear. Are you okay? Hmm. Chill. Don't think too much. So... If you are free... If you are only free... Can you please look into that policy? -Okay. -Please? Good girl. -Are you fine? -Yeah! Sure? Okay. This is the latest fabric in town, ma'am. This design looks good, right? Mom would like it too. Hmm, yes. Hello, Keerthi. Where are you? Your family would definitely love it sir. -Excuse me, just a minute. Meghana, I have continous meetings today. Can we catch up tomorrow, please? Oh, okay. Yeah. No problem. Hello. -Yes? Please don't come here. It's better not to meet anyone for a while. Why? You are the hot topic here. Everyone is discussing only about your wedding. Is it? I'll tell them something and manage. Don't meet any of our friends for a month. They would eventually forget and move on. Hello! Why won't you do it? What do you think about yourself? Do it right now. I don't want to take risk with policy. I won't call her at any cost. Okay... How can we help to make you guys talk? J-Just wait. That's it. For what? Until Meghana calls me, don't expect me to call her, okay! Okay... So should we ask Meghana to call you now? Huh! Forget it. Meghana. Please... Call Varun now. Hmm. Hey, it's Meghana, man! -Hello? -H-Hello, Varun? Yes, Meghana. When will you be done with your office? -Why do you ask? -Nothing, if you don't want to... No, Meghana. Did I mean that? I never knew my words could be twisted so much. Okay... Did you make the changes I asked for? Mr. Ravi? Did you make the changes which Ms. Meghana asked for? Y-Yes we did. Ask her if Ms. Meghana needs anything more. Meghana, do you need any further changes? No, that should do. I'm right in front of your office. What! Are you at my office now! Can we meet? Meghana, there's no need to talk about that wedding ever again. Thank you, Varun. What a relief! And yeah... I've informed my dad... That I will handle the policy work. So, you don't have to worry about it. Wow! That's amazing, Meghana. Thank you so much. I am so relieved now. But, did you come here just to inform this? Meghana, what's wrong? Varun, do you know something? My parents are more worried about people judging them about called off wedding, they are least concerned that it's my wedding or how I would feel. They never really discussed it with me. Yeah! Maybe they didn't want to remind you unnecessarily. That's not at all the case there. No, Meghana. Please listen to me. The reason I didn't call you until now is because, I didn't want to remind you of your wedding again. I know how serious were you, with that relationship and called off wedding. They are your parents, Meghana! Imagine how concerened they would be about you and your wedding. If they are not comfortable with people talking about the wedding, Then, let's just not talk about your wedding, alright! Okay! Some coffee? Yes. So, why do we have to bother, tell me. Why should it matter, who heard you out and who didn't. Who got you and who didn't. Whether we say it or not, certain people get it. And that's enough, right! Hmm, that's true. Do you know something? What? We can never forget how our relationships end, But we often don't remember how they get started at all. If you don't, do you think no one else would remember it too? N-No I usually remember. I just cooked a story to make you feel better. Then please enlighten me with your "betterment". -Are you asking me? -Hmm! Didn't you just mention a while ago. I'm unable to recollect what to say. Varun, I think you should remember. For the first time, when did it happen, how did it happen and with whom. Well, okay... When I was in school, Diary Milk was my favourite chocolate. When I asked my mom to buy it for me... ...she convinced me to get good grades. I didn't give my exams properly and I was very disappointed. Later that day, I was waiting at the bus stop... There was a girl's birthday and... ...she came forward and handed me a chocolate bar. That moment! I felt so good! What's her name? I-I don't know... I never met her again in life. Haven't you experienced this ever again in life? I failed my exam, when I was in my college... So this happens only during your examinations... Is it like a condition? My friends have been trolling me for the same reason. You don't start now, please! No, but, seriously I wanted to ask you a question. Are you still friends with your ex-girlfriend, Ms. Anusha? No, I don't like to be friends with her anymore. Once I breakup with someone... Consider it's done from my end. Let's not talk about my relationship, alright? Okay, one last question? -Yeah! Do you remember how your relationship started with Anusha? I'm unable to recollect. Didn't you ever experience it again after what you had with her? Whether it happened... ...or it did not happen... I'm absolutely not able to make it out. How come! You are an expert when it comes to such matters, right? Me! It's not how you think it is. Varun! Ice-cream? -Yeah! -Vanilla, okay? Okay! ♪ Troubles... ♪ ♪ Baby in trouble! ♪ ♪ Troubles of my mind, been traveling ♪ ♪ Traveling to my mind, to my body ♪ ♪ Troubles of my mind, ta tcha ♪ ♪ Speculating all the things that you do ♪ ♪ And you don't know that, I have been here ♪ ♪ I'm counting all my days to you ♪ You have called him thrice already. He didn't call you even once. Which means, he's least interested. Meghana, don't make a fool of yourself. It's just rebound stint. That's it. Rebound? What does that even mean? It means... Imagine you just went through a breakup... Later, your parents brought you a marriage proposal... You would immediately decide that she's the right one for you. That's how rebound works. Now you look at him. You see... Hey! What's wrong with me now? It's not about what happened now, it's about what could happen. That's the point. Hey, irrespective of what happens. Seriously, I'm not going to call her. Unless, I get a clarity. Just understand. He's not even your friend. Why am I talking to myself? It's just a bloody phone call. Just tell that you want to meet and ask where to meet. That's it. Time is past 1 AM. Is it okay to call now? We both are clear that you are in a deep confusion. Do you atleast have a clarity on what you're confused about? No... I don't want to take a random decision this time man. -Seriously! -Hmm So, you are not willing to call her even now. I won't call her at all. Okay, let me just call. No, no, no... Hey! It's quite natural, man. Don't you know? I have read about it too. Where did you read? Just a second. Let me show you a forward message. Oh holy lord! Hey! Half the people in this world get carried away by forward messages. Your stupid forward message theories! Shut up! Do you still think it's a rebound? Absolutely, dude! Fine! It's past 1 A.M now, Let's see... If you get a call from Meghana now, will you accept that it's not rebound? If you don't receieve a call... We'll accept that whatever happened in office was just mere coincidence. Why would Meghana call me at this hour? Why would she even think about me? It's past 1 A.M now. -I know! What if she really does? I wonder if it happens. What if it happens? What if she calls? If she calls... Meghana, please call Varun now. [mobile phone ringing] She's really calling me! What the... -How's it possible, dude?! -How do I know dude? Hello! H-Hello... Yes, Meghana? Hi Varun, I want to talk to you. Yes... Meghana, I have something to say too. What is it about? Actually... I am drunk now... I will blabber something... And you mishear my words and you end up misunderstanding. Is it necessary to talk now? Okay. Yeah, I understand. Shall we catch up tomorrow? Okay. Bye. ♪ Troubles of my mind, heart and mind ♪ ♪ Fire is burning out, just hold my hand ♪ What's up, Varun? What's happening with the policy? It will be done by end of the month, sir. -Are you sure? -Yes sir, it will be done. He seems to be busy! -I will definitely get it done, sir. -Okay, as you say. -Hey! -Hey Varun! You are looking good. What's special today? I don't know! Wow. What? First time when you came here, you said that you never want to come here again. So, you don't want me to come right... -H-Hey Meghana... Did I mean that? Why do you take everything seriously? It's better to focus on your job rather than focusing on girls. I think it's better to leave this place and go elsewhere. How many insurance policies did you get it done till date? Office hours right, I really can't come. It's okay. We don't really have to make decisions in haste, right? Meghana, the decisions I have made in a hurry... You know... What? It's like, feeling at this moment and believing in that moment, getting hurt because of those moments and later hurting someone else. Seriously I don't want to go through this all over again, Meghana. Varun, please try to understand. This is really serious. I barely even know you. But... But what? I feel like I want to spend time talking to you... On one hand, I feel it's just rebound... On the other hand... I feel exactly the same, Meghana! But... -But what? I'm not sure how long this excitement would last... ... 35 years is quite a long time, right? What shall we do then? Let's see. See what? Let's see how long our excitement lasts. Do you think it won't last very long? Do you want to take it forward or not? -N-No... It's not... Y-Yes, I want to. What did I just say and what're you thinking. Then what shall we do about it? Let's have a cup of coffee first. Whatever you say, Mr. Varun. Okay! Varun you are more confused than I am. So, Meghana tell me. What do we do? Varun, I don't want to hurt you or myself. If something goes wrong in a relationship... I might completely lose trust. I am in same boat as you are in. I didn't get you. I've always taken life decisions without giving it a thought. I don't even know how to think now. Varun, inspite of thinking, I still failed to make right decisions. So, it doesn't matter anymore. Meghana! We shouldn't take a wrong decision... ... by getting carried away... ... emotionally... unnecessarily. It's "Unnecessary", Varun? Okay. No problem. No, it's necessary only. Meghana, try to understand my problem too. Meghana, I have no clue why all this is happening. I don't even know you properly. I felt the same and I only realized it lately. What? Men start to like when they are given what they expect. Oh is it? In that case... I want to add to that. What is it? Women mostly start liking when they are hear what they love to be heard. Hmm... What do you mean? Meghana please, enough of our philosophy. I'm unaware if I really know... Even if I knew, I don't know how to say Even if I said, I don't know how you would understand... ...whether you understand or not. If I don't understand? Meghana! Would you like to give it a try? I mean... You know... Would you like to give it a try? I mean, we need to affirm that it's not rebound certainly, right? Meghana, until we're sure... We should strictly not discuss about this. Okay? Let's see. Leave aside. I think you need to get back to work. I will leave now. Let me also come with you. What about your work? I will do it later. What about your job? I'll manage that too. What about your friends' jobs then? This is more important than my friends at the moment. What do you mean by "This"?

There is no reason to feel like this, do you get it? Why! Do you really think I'm not aware of anything? Do you think it's more deeper than just rebound? Yeah, I mean, It could be. I just feel it. Do you think Varun feels the same? Yeah. He is behaving as such. So... Maybe. As far as I see it... You saved his job, And that's the only reason he's being good. Do you really think it's because of the job? It seems to be, certainly. Cancel the policy and see what happens. I am sure he would change. What about Varun's job then? He promised that he would get it sorted in a month, right? -So... -This is the best time to know. How serious "your" Varun is about you. Yes, that's very important. I don't want to... ...to intentionally play around... ...just to test him. Alright, then. You will suffer later. If you approach uncle with confessing your love again... He will kill you. Did you think through it? Why will he hurt me? He would hurt Varun instead. -Meghana! -Hmm? When can we receive our policy refund? I think it will take another month, Dad. One month! Yes. Let me meet. -I will talk to them. -Don't worry about it, I'll handle. Why, Meghana? Let uncle handle it. I will take care of it! No! I will do it. You think earning money is a cakewalk! -Dad... -Listen! I want to close everything about that marriage. This is the only thing remaining. Meghana! I have a meeting to attend later. Come, let's go. Coming dad, just a minute. They've sent their daughter to get the policy done but he's trying to own both. Come on! Oh, wow! You're doomed! By the way... Did Meghana say something? Asking you to meet or to introduce. She'll definitely inform if there's any problem. Hey! We are already in a serious problem. Don't you understand? First let me meet her father, man. Then we can talk. Why does she always call when my friends are around. Hello! -Hello. -Yes, Meghana. Varun, we are in your office. "We"? Me and my father. Are you with your dad in my office! He would like to talk to you rergarding the policy. Alright. I will be there. He is coming. So, let's wait for him. What a miracle! Until now, I've only seen our wishes turning into reality. but now things are happening irrespective of what we wish. When our time comes, things will fall in place whether we wish for it or not. That's a fact! That's correct. Did you ever imagine that your marriage would end up with divorce? Dude! The topic here is him, not me. Atleast, she should've inform in prior that she's bringing her father along, right Ravi? I would have prepared myself. Dude! Preparation for what? This is not about your love... This is regarding our jobs. Try to convince and manage them. And... Whatever it takes, just tell them not to do disturb the policy for a month. Hmm, okay. -Go! It's so difficult to convince your mom, I tell you. You express all this with me, but have no guts to talk in front of mom. Good Morning, ma'am. Good Morning. He's my dad... ... he would like to discuss with you. -Hello, sir. Hello! Please sit. Thank you. -Yes. -You're Varun, right? -Yes sir. My daughter's wedding was called off for some reason. We got that policy done when wedding was fixed. Yes, I know sir. First of all... Let me thank you. Meghana mentioned about you. You absolutely maintained the secrecy. Thank you very much, mister. That's my duty, sir. I wish if my colleagues and partners would've thought the same. Is it a big deal, sir! Whatever happens is purely for our well being, sir. Well. Maybe. If you are concerned about our well being... Can you return our money? I've already informed to Meghana ma'am... What? You haven't returned our money yet. If, needed... I can go and speak to your superiors. There is no need for that, sir. I can manage. We need the money. Sir, there is lot of paper work to do to just to claim your money. Your daughter should get married anyway, so you can hold the policy till then and renew it later. Meghana said we'll get the money in a month. She's always ready to screw my case. I told her with the pretext that she would get married this month. If not, you can just cancel it. In a month? How is it possible? Come on. We need our money back. Let us know when can you return it. Do people get their policy done with every wedding? We got it done, because it was needed back then. I meant, in case if you need again, this comes in handy. If you still need your money, I can arrange for that. I just have to put a word with my seniors but... ... everyone would come to know, I was trying to avoid unnecessary publicity. That makes sense, dad. Why to complicate things and allow everyone to talk about it? Hmm. Okay. You mean to say... It's better to not claim our refund, is that it? Yes, that's right sir. You can just go ahead with your policy when you decide to get her married. Okay. Excuse me. Well, I have to attend a meeting. Well, please do it as soon as possible. -Okay sir. -If there's any possibility... -Yes, sure. -Okay. Meghana, I am heading to office. How are you going? -She will come along with me, sir. Excuse me! He meant, we'll go by company car dad. He just doesn't know anything. Is it? You should be careful, mister. You will have problems with your wife due to miscommunication. Whatever you have said, makes complete sense, sir. -Huh? -Why? You have known Meghana since she was a child, right. WHAT! He must have meant it, since I am also a girl, right! That's what he meant. Right? Man! You better do learn how to speak. Meghana ma'am is training me... Oh God! Anyway... Come home, whenever possible. I have some work with you. -I need to discuss about our new venture. -Absolutely sir! Why are you involving Varun here, dad? -How does it matter to you! Look! My family's biggest secret is... ... calling off your wedding. He is aware of all this. What else does it take for him to work with our family? Yes sir. Atleast check whether he is talented or not, dad. She started blabbering again! I trust him. He had maintained secrecy when things are confidential. That's absolutely good. -He is a man of integrity. -Thank you, sir. Excuse me. Hello. Yes, Mr. Varma! Yes. Yes, I am on the way. Okay! I have to go. Bye dad. I guess... Your dad is pretty impressed with me. No matter what, he priortizes his business... ...and his honour more than anything. -Hmm -That makes me worried. -Meghana! -Hmm? -You should come to my place. -What! I didn't mean that. -My mom is in town. -So? So... I just want to introduce you to her. What? Let's see! How much can you impress my mom! Is that really necessary now? Please, Meghana. Your dad won't allow us to meet eachother once you get married. Please, my dad is not that stupid okay! I want the mail to be sent today. It's very important. -Good morning, sir. -Hi. Hello. So, this is the plan. Do you realize that you are the most luckiest person? Why do you say that? You saved your business without getting your daughter married. -Well. -I don't get it. He could only save his company's business by getting his son married. I accepted this proposal due to Meghana's wish and not because of my business. Everyone here knows the reason for your acceptance. Just leave it. No! Everyone's pointing fingers at me. Ofcourse! I did think about my business. I thought about my employees too. I am ready to do anything for them. That's a fact! But... Would you accept if Meghana was in love with an ordinary guy? -You won't, would you? -Why wouldn't I? I started my career as a basic employee, Isn't it? Come on... Would you get Meghana married to an ordinary guy? You would not, right? -Just leave it, man. -Why wouldn't I? I will definitely get her married, if she desires. Forget about her preference. Would you do it proactively? Everyone knows about you, why are you trying to defend yourself? We are all businessmen. We prioritize our business more than anything. What is it now! I've to get my daughter married to an ordinary guy. You guys would believe then. That's upto you. You mean to say that... I have to prove that, my business is not so important as my daughter. Is that all! No no... It's not important now. Leave that aside. We'll look into that later. Let's take care of work now. Come. Okay, look at this. Yeah! It's okay, come on. Verify if your share values are right. Later, you would make a scene again. -Mom? -Yeah. What if Meghana doesn't reach your expectations? It's your call, dont you worry about me. It's not about that, mom. Please don't force your ideologies and ask her to be traditional etc. Even you don't obey my words, how can I expect her to obey me! It's not like that, mom. You want me to accept her even if she shows up in western clothing. -That's what you expect, right. -Yes, pretty much. Did you ever enter the kitchen in our home all these years? Now you're trying to overact. Mom, please don't cook like how you do for dad, okay. Please make it delicious. Do you think your dad survived all these years with my mediocre cooking skills? My poor dad! God knows how did he manage to survive! Let me know what Meghana likes, I'll cook the same. I don't know, mom. I never asked her. Do you atleast know what she dislikes? I-I really don't have a clue, mom. What does she like to eat the most? The only savoury she likes the most, is icecream, as far as I know. -I have something for her then. -Icecream? -Something of that sort. -What? -Hello aunty! -Hello! She looks so desirable. Why did you comment about her like that? What did he say, aunty? Nothing, Meghana. He said that Meghana might not meet my assumptions, and insisted me to accept you however you are, irrespectively. What do you mean by "However"? Mom, there's something burning in the kitchen, please go and check. Please take a seat, Meghana. Come, let's sit. Yes. So what did you tell your mom about me? What would I say? I said nothing. Did you tell her that my wedding was called off? Why would I tell her, Meghana? What if she comes to know through someone else in future, wouldn't she mind? Have you lost your mind? Why would anyone say that? Is it okay to not tell her about it? Meghana, I hid it from her for our own good. It doesn't matter if she knew. You don't worry about it, okay? Please. Hmm, okay. -Meghana? -Hmm? Well, to be honest... You look so stunning in this dress. Oh, really! -Varun! -Yes, mom. Come, let's have food. Let's go. -Meghana... -Yes? Where and how did you both meet? A-Aunty... Earlier... when my wedding was fixed... But mom, that wedding was called off and we met regarding some work. That's alright, dear. It's actually their loss to leave you. That's all. Yes, that's what. Who knows whom are we destined to marry. Don't think too much about it. Thank you, aunty. By the way, You haven't told me if you liked our dishes. It tastes better than my mom's cooking, aunty. Just a second. What's this, mom? It's a milk pudding! What's with the milk pudding now, mom? You mentioned that Meghana loves ice-cream, right? Yes, but... Isn't milk pudding different from ice cream, mom? Don't you like it, dear? Nothing of that sort, aunty. Meghana, if you don't like it, don't force yourself. Varun, it's okay. It's fine. Varun, I can't... You don't wan't? No, please take some. By the way... We both can share from the same cup, isn't it? I would've given you another cup, right. Inspite of me telling, he snatched my share too, aunty. Varun! -Meghana. -Yes? Atleast now, please express your likes and dislikes with him. Aunty, we never discussed this topic before, so... He doesn't even know my likes and dislikes so far. It doesn't really matter to me. But, he can't behave like this with you, right? A-Aunty, there's nothing like that. Speaking of him, I'm still trying to understand... Whether I'm living according to his preferences, or is he living in accordance to my preferences. Aunty, this savoury is delicious. Wait, let me get you one more cup then. Enough mom, she's getting late. She's getting calls from her mom already. I think, I can't find a better girl for your than her dear. Mom, I will drop her and come. Do you know that I'm feeling the same? Like what? Like your mom said. What did mom say? I'm also trying to understand. Whether I'm being in accordance to your desires, or are you in accordance to my preferences. To be honest, Meghana. Ya? I don't know. You know it better. Varun... I don't want to go home anytime soon. To be honest, I have no interest in going home either. Wouldn't your mom mind if you don't go early? She might kick me out if I go early. Varun... Can I ask you something? After all this, why are you still trying to be formal? I mean, it's a girl thing. But you shouldn't judge me after my question. Okay, I won't judge you. Tell me now. Nothing as such, but... What did you think of me when we met for the first time? I just wanted to know. I felt... The person who gets married to you would be so doomed. That's why, you are unfortunate now! What did you just say! Forget about that. How long do you think it would take for us to get clarity in our relationship? I have the clarity... -But... -But? I'm not sure if this clarity is enough for marriage. Why do you think so? [sighs] -I don't know, Meghana. -What do you mean? See, everything came easy to us. They say, anything which comes easy doesn't last long, so... You have a problem either way, when things come easy or when they don't. Meghana, I didn't mean it. I don't want to rush things. Who is asking you to rush now? No Meghana, I didn't really mean it. What we wished to happen with someone, when it happens with someone else, It would take time to understand whatever has happened, right? Well... What we wanted to say it to someone and when we end up saying it to someone else, It would take time to say those words, right? That's what, Meghana. Meghana, do you know something? Whatever we desire, when it's also desired by the person who we like, That's considered to be lucky. What! Where do you pick up these quotes from? I don't know, it just came naturally. Okay! In that case... Can I share my philosophy too? Yes, tell me. I would like to know your philosophy. Varun, to be honest... When things were expected to happen with someone, but when they endup happening with someone else, the time taken to understand that reality is what's destiny is. Alright. Let's see. Let's see how long would you take to realize. Are you not afraid with all this confusion? I don't see a reason to be scared. The fear lies in figuring out whether the girl likes you back or not. -But... -But? But, I'm sure you like me. There's nothing to be scared of. But it's not the case with me. Meghana, you are in far more better situation than I am in. Varun! Ice-cream? Vanilla, okay? I have a great advice for you both. What is it? You both should host a TV show titled "Philosophies of love". Why! Do you guys realize what you both are up for? That's what, uncle. I just don't want anything to go wrong. You had to face lot of problems with aunt, for mistakes you committed unintentionally, just in a hurry. U-Uncle, I'm really sorry. I shouldn't have said that. Sorry! Thank God! Atleast you understood that I've made a mistake without realizing. We men, understand only 10 things out of 100 that we do. But when it comes to women, they do 90 things out of 100 knowingly. So? I see no problem with Meghana, But I strongly doubt you. You suspect me? What have I done? If you were so sure about it, you would have known by now. You wouldn't try and find excuses and reasons unncessarily. I'm thinking about it too. I really don't understand... ...why am I doubting myself so much. Hey Varun, I forgot to mention something. Yes, what is it? I think Meghana's father will get her married pretty soon. Why is he in such a hurry! I felt so, when I met him last time. What should I do now, uncle? What do you expect me to suggest? What would you tell her, if she asks you the same question? I don't have an answer, if she asks this suddenly. Can I be honest with you? Yes, tell me. You would probably understand, when the fear of Meghana leaving strikes you, But not when she actually leaves you. I guess this is her house. Whatever! Varun, be careful. Just behave yourself. I hope everything gets sorted. -Hello sir. -Hello Varun, come in. Sir, these are the documents I've made. This is where you have to sign, sir. And... Here's the brochure and... You can just go through it when you're free, sir. Stop overacting, Varun. Your actions are more than necessary. Sir, I've to tell you this... You have done a great favour to us and saved our jobs, sir. I have to thank you for this. You have to really learn how to speak. It's just a mutual help, that's all. Save the work for later and let's have food first. Can you give us two minutes? -I have to check some papers. -OK. -Varun. -Yes, ma'am. -Why don't you join us too? -It's okay ma'am, It's fine. That's alright. Please come. Stop your drama and join us for lunch. So... Are you married? Actually, not yet. So, what's your future plans? My future plans... I want to outgrow and become the manager of our company. That's good. So, Mr. Varun? You won't get married till you become a manager then. In that case, I'm available for next three years. You are taking ages to get my policy done, man, i'm so done with you, man. What is this guy doing here! Do something fast, I've my wedding round the corner. If he needs one, am I not here to do it! I found my scapegoat! -Excuse me, sir. -Yes? Are you planning to get an insurance, sir? I need no insurance, man. But my girlfriend's father wants to get it done. I just want my wedding to get done. That's what, fathers these days... Getting an insurance policy has become a new trend now. Did your father-in-law too forced you to take an insurance? He is trying to get it done, but... I'm not sure if it's for me or someone else, sir. I have no clue what's happening with these insurance policies. Insurance policies are subjected to various terms and conditions sir. This insurance serves as a precaution for any problems faced in life. What could be more unfair than a marriage? It's true, but... Our wedding can be unfair to us but not to anyone else, sir. I believe you got benefitted a lot through someone else's wedding, is it? To be honest... Yes, indeed. Come on, tell me. So, the story goes like this. A girl liked a guy a lot... But their parents are more concerned about their business than their children. So to save their business, they planned to get their children married... And they approached me to get their insurance policy done. So, your policy acted as support for their marriage. Sir, that wedding was called off and thus policy too. Then? That girl left her groom behind, her father behind and now she's chasing me. Oh! What happened next? What do you expect? Her father is bugging me for the policy refund, sir. Now, should I apply for the policy or not? -Sir... -Please get it done. If you want your wedding to be called off, please go ahead and consult him. Oh, is it! -I'm done with you and your policy. -Sir! Sir, please... Hmm. Am I running behind you? -My dad is irritating you, right? -I-I didn't mean it. Then what! Okay, leave that aside. Shall we go to a movie? Today is an off. Finally, you managed to impress Meghana's father. And Meghana impressed his mother in return. You please finish the paper work and try to impress her dad. -It only works out then. -Oh! I forgot to mention something. All the documentation is done. It's all set. -We're sorted. -Wow! that's awesome, man. Thank you so much! I'm not sure how his and Meghana's story would end up, but... -My story has come to a conclusion. -What happened? I mean... -I proposed to Pooja. -Oh nice! And she accepted. -Wow! That's awesome, man. -Yeah! -Your party is in the lineup then. -Yes, yes. So your drama worked out well. By the way, what happened to your divorce? I haven't told you right! Yesterday... I scolded her for once! That if she puts on any more weight, I warned that she'll be sent back to her home. That's it, she forgot about the divorce and started dieting. -(laughs) -Whatever! It's all good. No tension. You finally learnt to control my stupid sister-in-law. -Shut up! -Just sister-in-law, okay! -Be careful -One minute. -Hello! -Hello Varun, are you in office? -Yes, sir. -Come to my cabin once. Yes, sure sir. Bye. -Manager! -Oh! I believe it is regarding this. Throw it on his table, we should be able to hear it here. Listen! If he threatens us to fire from our jobs again... Tell him that we're going to quit our jobs. Hey! Don't you think, you guys are talking a bit too much? I feel so. You please leave. Yes it's okay, sir. Definitely, we'll take care. Mister! Finally, you guys have managed to save your jobs. Sir, here are the documents. You can send them to head office. No, I'm not talking about this. I'm asking about the marriage policy. Sir, it's on hold. But it will be done by end of the month. How come it's still on hold! They asked me to replace the names and I have done it. Sir, we have already submitted those papers. No no... -I heard their wedding was called off. -Yes, sir. But I heard everything is settled now. -What did you say, sir? -I mean... The girl's father spoke to me recently. He requested me to not speak about the called off wedding. And I promised him that I would maintain secrecy. Sir, you're talking about the policy I've been working out, right? Yes, Varun. Is something wrong? What's the name of the girl? Just a second. -It's Meghana. -What! Meghana? Yes, it's Meghana. Her wedding was replanned just recently. The girl's father spoke to me again recently. He asked me not to discuss about called off wedding with anyone. So, I agreed. Sir, did Meghana accept this proposal? Ofcourse she did and that's why she's getting married. Sir... I heard you caused a lot of trouble previously. Don't risk your jobs unnecessarily. The company is running in losses and they're very serious about it. I hope you understood the gravity of the situation. To save your and your friends' jobs, I'm warning you to not discuss anything about that girl or her wedding. Leave it. Forget about it. Take this. Handle your work with care. Okay, sir. Last time, I agreed with you. It's not me who cancelled. -I didn't cancel it either. -But it's called off! -I don't want to discuss further. -Whatever! Don't talk to me about it, unless you're sure. I understand. Is the manager happy? Yes, why not! We've worked out a policy worth 20 million. Varun! What happened! Meghana's wedding is fixed itseems. How will they fix without her compliance? Unless she gave the nod, how would they fix! -Oh! -How come! How on hell did she agree to it? When did you speak to her last? Actually, I spoke to her last morning. But... Hey! Please call her once. We'll have a clarity atleast. -No way! -Varun! Just listen to me. Call her once. Dude... Maybe... I feel I'm overthinking. I mean, why would she even like me man? You stupid ****! -Dude! -Varun! If that was the case, we would've known by now. Please, try to call her once. He won't call her anyway. Meghana, please call! Seriously! -Hello! -Varun, I need to talk to you. I need to talk to you too. -I'm outside your office. -Okay, I'm coming. -Guys, I have to go! -Handle it carefully! All the best, man! Meghana, what's happening? All this is happening because of you. What have I done? It's you who mislead my dad... That his money is safe if he gets me married this month. How would I expect that he would take my words seriously? Obviously he would be concerned, as you spoke about his daughter's wedding. Didn't you mention that your parents don't take your words seriously? You would speak anything just for the sake of saving your job. Are you serious! Do you think my job is more important than you? You behave like one. And you are talking like one. Without considering the situation I am in. Are you aware of what situation you are in? What do you mean? The only important decision you had to take in your life, you took almost three years to decide. And you messed up that too. You blindly accepted the proposal your dad brought for you. I mean, you don't even know what situation you are in. It doesn't matter. Okay! I think it's high time we need to take a decision now. -Regarding what? -Regarding us. Didn't we decide that we'll wait for a month or two. How can I take a decision at such short notice? Yeah, I know, but what now! You need more time to think, this is it, right. I cannot take a decision all of a sudden, Meghana. All of a sudden? Did I ever insist you about this until now? I need some time, Meghana. Huh! I got it. There is no risk to your career now, There are no issues in your job too. You have nothing to do with me henceforth, so... You don't need me anymore, right? Meghana, did I mean that? Meghana it's not how you think it is, okay! M-Meghana! Wait! Meghana, it's not like that. I'm just not sure. That's it. You aren't sure about us... I mean, you aren't sure about me, right? Meghana, didn't you mention not to bring this topic anytime soon? I didn't expect to be asked to take this decision so soon. Can anyone take a decision in a month or two? Varun... You could have taken this decision in a jiffy. But if you are unable to take a decision about me even after two months then... Huh! I understand! You need not lie to entice me. It's fine. Meghana, please try to understand! Meghana!

You asked me what am I about your gift, right? I bought this Saree just for your wedding. I didn't gift you as wedding was called off. Hmm. It's good. It's great, actually. What happened to you, Meghana? Nothing. Aren't you happy about this wedding? I don't know. Are you in love with someone? Hmm. I don't know. Is someone in love with you? I don't know. Why that smirk on your face? Varun said... I hardly try to understand the situation I am in. I feel what he said is absolutely true. Do you want me to convince your dad that you aren't happy with this wedding? I've no clarity, anyway. Just forget it, mom. Are the decorations done? Okay, we're just coming. Hi aunty! Meghana, let's go. We need to book wedding hall. It's the only work we have for the day. Usha is already there. Let's go. Mom, don't worry about it. I'm alright. I am being practical enough. Bye, aunty! Fill this form and submit it. Whose is this? It's Meghana's. Oh! It has come quite far, I believe. Varun! You do know why has it been dragged so far. Leave that aside. Finish the paperwork first. Why don't you do it! Dude! We aren't ready to do it if there's someone else's name on the application. It's you who started. So... You have to finish it. God! I can't do this man! So, what shall we do? I need to talk to Meghana. Why! Will you tell her that you are not just trying to finish the policy work but also try replace your name in the form? I'll reveal everything. I have a lot to confess to Meghana. It's about time. Finally! I have to talk to my uncle. -Hello? -Yes, uncle. I'm very sure about Meghana right now. What happened to you suddenly? Uncle, you said that we don't understand the value when they leave, but, we start to understand when we start having fear of them leaving. If he gives a word... I-I might have said. What's wrong now! Uncle, I've an ordinary job but Meghana is from business class family. W-Why didn't you think through this logic before? What do you want me to do now! Are you worried about Meghana or her father? I-I want Meghana. Anyway, you have decided, right? Wait, I'll get back to you. Okay, bye. -Sorry. -It's alright, sir. By the way... If you have to talk to Meghana, won't you have to wait for her to call? How does it matter! Wait, I'm calling her. [mobile phone ringing] [mobile phone ringing] She must be busy with her wedding chores. Will you just shut up! He didn't realize until he had to replace the names in the form. By the way, you know her friend, right? Yes I do, but she doesn't know me, right! What shall we do now! Do you now realize what was going on in your life until now? Inspite of knowing that it's wrong, it still takes lot of time to understand. What! Nothing... We express our anger on people effortlessly. But to express love... We take a lot of time to even think or understand, or to even realize the fact. It's time for all of us to hit the trail. Why? He started to talk philosophy. So, the place looks great. We love the decoration... ...and it's really grand and it looks exactly like... ...like how we would like it. -Great! About the catering, I wanted to ask... ... do you have continental cuisine also? -Yes, we do. -Oh damn! Guys, Mr. Satya is engaged! -Just give me a moment. -Yeah, okay. He just posted. Huh! Let it be. Meghana's wedding is fixed too. Then, let's also post about it. We've booked the venue too. -Is that necessary now! -Let's do it from your phone only! -I think I forgot my phone at home. -Okay, let it be. -Let us post. -Hmm. Okay. -Let's do it from my phone. -Yeah. Come on. Firstly, check Meghana's whereabouts. Okay? Okay, sir. Atleast ping her, we would know if she responds. Hello! Say no more! Pooja checks my phone messages. I can't take that risk, you know! You always hype about it. Saying, things happen immediately whenever you wish for it. Prove it now, man! And stop overacting. We credited him for all those coincidences, But she actually did it because she liked. That's what I am saying. Now that Meghana doesn't like him, so... So, things aren't happening as per your wish, that's it right? Then, you try wishing for it. It may happen. I have been trying to reach out, call her for an hour now. Alright, shall we go to Meghana's house? Shall we go there and check? I doubt whether she's at home. -Varun! -Yes! I found her location What's happening, Varun! It doesn't look like Meghana had come to book the venue. It seems like she's here for her own wedding. -Are we here already! -Wait, wait... Cool, cool. What will you tell her now? As if she's ready to listen to him. I will confess whatever I want to, whether she cares or not. That's fine dude. But what are you going to say? When I failed to convey things I was supposed to share it with someone I don't even know how to make you guys understand. Enough! Just go there and tell! When they say it's match made in heaven... I think this is it. He's pretending as if nothing happened. He thinks I will take it for granted. I came to say a lot of things, but... But? Forget that! I'm really sorry, I couldn't lie to you when you came to office the other day. That day, I-I just couldn't pretend with you. Sorry, Varun. Maybe... If I've to be with you or you with me I think we need to start to learn to lie and decieve each other. It's okay. Atleast, it's better than breaking up. Meghana, do you even realize what you're doing! How will you explain this to your father? Just tell him that venue is amazing. Excuse me! I'm not talking about venue. I will talk to my dad. -I mentioned about Varun already. -What! -What did he say then? -What would he? He said he would agree and accept you, if you return by yourself. Otherwise, I would have has to obey my Father. Oh! This is the reason she didn't call him for so many days. Meghana, whatever you say. I will try and convince your dad, please. You sure about this, right? I hope you don't blame me later for pushing and forcing you. I hope you don't blame me. I think this is the first time someone has ever won a girl's heart without trying to attempt to make a single phone call. It's not at all the case. When he finally realized that and tried to call you back, he just lost his breath, waiting for you to respond. -Meghana. -Hmm? I want you to come home. Why, is your mom in town? There's no one at home and that's why I want you to come. -Why don't you increase the amount? -Isn't this sufficient? I think this is enough for both of us. What about poor Varun then? Hello! There is no mercy! It doesn't really matter about if he has a job anymore. Inform me, if he doesn't perform well. Okay? Only about his performance or his other activities too? Oh, tell me some secrets about Varun. I will tell her the rest, you please go and finish the paperwork. -Varun will pay for this. -All the best! Hey, Hemanth! Do you think they're in true love or is it just a rebound? We can never figure that out. But we're done with our work here.
