Your zodiac sign is ox. Stubborn, but also industrious and hard-working. Fate has promised you a reward for your efforts. Hmm. You have experienced a recent loss. Someone close to you has died. Leaving your year pillar "empty." You are without shade in your old age. Hmm. Fate has cheated you. Xin. Huh. I see the element "xin" in your destiny. Signifying momentous change. This coincides with your ten-year-luck pillar. What day? October 28th. This year. Is it good or bad? This is really good, Grandma Wong! Carps jumping over dragon gate! So auspicious! Your reward is coming! You must keep your eyes open for the dragon gate- Your lucky day is coming! Two dollars. How much? Two dollars. 50 cents. Peter, stop it! Grandma, tell him to stop! No! Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! You wanna blow out the candles, Grandma? Yay. - Yeah! - Here we go. Who wants cake? Okay, so... Ma, um... Lin and I have been talking and we think you should come live with us. I like my apartment. But it just makes sense. We wouldn't have to pay for both places. I'll pay it myself. How? With what? Your retirement money? You'll see... Plus... I think, maybe you shouldn't be living by yourself. Look what happened when you hurt your ankle. It's fine. No one was there. What if next time it's more serious? I'm in perfect health. Doctor Chen just says my yang is too exuberant. Doctor Chen is not a real doctor. He treated Mei's diabetes! So she doesn't have diabetes anymore? Yes! She doesn't pee as much as she used to. You know, most people your age would be excited to be with family. Most my people do... Most... Most people your age would be excited to be with family. Dad wouldn't want you to be by yourself. He doesn't have a say. I'm leaving. Good morning. How can I help you today?

You sure you don't want to set some of that on the side, little lady? Eight! That is thousands and thousands of dollars, you know. Oh, my goodness... Gong! Gong! Eight. Another eight. Eight wins again. Four and four. King and four. Natural four. Another round? Rest in peace. Look, Little Handsome. How green and smooth these leaves are! She must use chicken bones or something. Egg shells? We should take one for the boss. He'll love it. Shhh! Look, she's here. Grandma Wong! Doing a little shopping? Big night at the slots? I like craps myself. Always feels like a party when you're winning. What? The ride from the casino is what? 3 hours? More or less. What, what, what... ...are you guys doing at my home?! And you? What do you like? Slots? Blackjack? Oh, allow me. Do you know who else liked the slots? Mr. Lin! Old Peng said you sat next to him last night. He's Fukienese. About... this tall. I was asleep. Sure, sure. You know, poor Mr. Lin on the bus had a heart attack. Ah! Did you realize you were sitting next to a dead man? I already told you I was asleep! Asleep! Eh? You don't seem very surprised though, Grandma Wong. When you're my age, not much shocks you. Sure, sure... You didn't happen to notice if Mr. Lin had anything with him? A bag or a briefcase? My eyes aren't so good. Mind if I look at what you got? I do mind! I know your aunt, you know?! You're not going to tell Auntie Chang, are you? Little Handsome here wouldn't like that. And when he doesn't like something, he can hurt himself. You see, Little Handsome doesn't feel pain. But other people aren't so lucky. If you don't mind, we'd like to take a look at your package there... - Fancy. - Huh. Very nice! And very expensive! I got a discount! No disrespect from the Red Dragon. We're sorry if Mr. Lin's death caused you any distress. To have someone die right next to you... Such bad luck! Let's go. See you next time. DKNY. Coach. Prada, CK, YSL. Check it out. Very cheap and nice. Prada, CK, YSL, Coach. I'd like to buy a bag. Coach? Would you like a Coach bag? I want LV. Are you sure you don't want Prada? Or a DKNY? We have many kinds. I want a limited edition LV. We don't have LV. I know you have it. You sure you don't want something else? I said I want LV! Okay, okay. If you are sure, follow me. Almost there. Hurry up! Go forward! Blow up his head! Boss, this old lady wants to chat with you. How can I help you, Grandma? You're Lao Shei? I am. Um... I heard you offer protection services? Many of the local businesses use our services... I want... I'd like to hire a bodyguard. Sorry Grandma. Excuse us. But we don't provide services for individuals. We're here for the community at large, you see. The Red Dragon is bothering me. May I ask... Why would the Red Dragon bother an elderly woman like yourself? How would I know? They showed up at my house. Started to follow me around. It's very frightening. Well, if you want to give us business... How much? $8000. I can find you someone. $8000? $8000 for a weak, elderly woman like me? Is that reasonable? High risk, Grandma. The Red Dragon is no joke. They are no match for you Zhongliang Gang though. It's a piece of cake for you, right? That's true. $5000. I... I'll sacrifice my health and cut back on medicine. I'll sacrifice my health and cut back on medicine. Grandma, if you're not feeling well, perhaps you shouldn't smoke... All right! $5000. That's as low as I can go. $5000... Then I want that guy! Him? No way! Alan is one of our best men! You're selling me inferior service?! That's not what I meant. Then $2000. We just said $5000. $5000 is for him! Discount bodyguard, discount rate. When were you born? 1987. 87... The year of the rabbit. Weak. Cautious. Where are you from? Jiangsu. Same as me. Hi. When I tell you to stay home, you stay home. Why? No answer back. Huh? You're like your father. You don't listen! But I liked your cooking. Eat, eat, eat... What is it? What about him? Big Pong? Don't mind him. I am a little hungry. Wide awake, aren't you? Now that there's food. Okay, come, come. Bring the chair. Thank you. Want some chicken? Thanks. I don't eat chicken. I'm vegetarian. Grandma's chicken's really good. My grandmother used to make drunken chicken too. She didn't put anise in it though. She said anise overpowered the flavor of the wine. That's silly! Anise brings out the flavor. Can't believe she doesn't know that. She used a pinch of allspice instead. Yeah. Who? - It's me. - Who's me? What the fuck? Hi, Nomi. Who the fuck is this, D? Uh... That's my grandma's friend. Your grandma has a friend and it's this guy? I'm Nomi. And I'm Lil' D. And we are Slavic Wong. Follow and subscribe here. What the fuck? I was mid-twerk! You guys are too loud. I'm sorry, uncle. We'll turn it down. Who's that? I live downstairs. Your music is too loud. I can't sleep! And how many times do I have to tell you every time you cook fish, you stink up the whole building. Oh okay, we hear you. And as I have said before, don't leave the trash outside your door. Take it outside like everyone else. Okay, okay. Is that all? Wow, you are a giant. You think you scare me just because you're 8 feet tall? I'm tired of you not following the rules like everybody else. We'll see what the landlord has to say about this. You understand, old woman? What are you...? Oh, and I know that you... ...you don't have a lease... You! You should respect your elders! If Grandma wants to cook fish, she will cook fish. If she needs to take out the trash, then you do it for her. - Got it? Huh? - Yes, yes... Yes, yes... This is 33. Grandma Ming, you remember last time? We wrote it down on a paper. Grandma, are you okay in there? I'm fine. You ready? It's Tuesday. I get my hair done on Tuesdays. Okay. You're gonna have to wait. Okay. Sorry... Go get me some tea. You want Oolong or Jasmine? Whatever. Grandma! How's it going? Hmm? Where's your new friend? Grandma. Why would an old lady like you be spending so much time with a member of the Zhongliang? Are they really that charming? At least... they know how to respect elders. Old bitch... where is the money? I don't know what you are talking about. What are you doing?! Don't be stupid! Come on! Where is the money? You! Why are you bothering an old lady? No, no... She didn't do anything to you! Get lost! You think they'll come back? The Red Dragon are cowards. I heard they're all impotent. You know, from the drugs. But you won't always be with me. I'll be here. Sometimes you won't be. Grandma, maybe... you owe them money? No, not even one cent. But - I told you. I really don't have business with the Red Dragon. Then why are they bothering you? How should I know? I think it's strange too. I have nothing they want. Agh, they smoke up too much. It messes with their brain. Only the dumb ones join the Red Dragon. Once I pay off my debt, I'm going back to Hsinchu. Me and my sister are making a health app. Eat more, you need your strength. Well? Your year pillar hasn't changed. Maybe you made a mistake about the dragon gate. That's not possible. Look at this, all best luck. Why do these messy things keep happening? Grandma Wong, I'm not too sure what to say... Your luck still looks very strong. Maybe the feng shui in your house has been altered? Ok, let me write you a prescription. Chrysanthemum leaves and one goldfish. Don't worry. Your good luck will come back around. Wait for me here. What? Are you sure? I'll be fine. This is Benny's place. Nothing dangerous will happen. But... Wait for me. Mrs. Wong! You're looking younger every day, ageless beauty! Long time no see. Yes, Mrs. Wong. What can I do for you? Some advice? Oh. Please have a seat. How are you doing? A few aches and pains. Sorry. Still not feeling well? Last week, when I was on the bus, there was a man sitting next to me. And he suddenly died. That really frightened me! You were on the same bus with Mr. Lin? So you heard? A terrible thing. His heart attack happened so suddenly. What do you know about him? He was Zhongliang. Though there were rumors he played both sides - but he worked directly for the Snakehead, actually. I thought he was part of Red Dragon. No, he was the accountant for the Zhongliang. The accountant. What do you know about the Zhongliang Snakehead? Sister Fong? She's a well-respected member of the community. Her relocation services have helped many people. She's very shrewd. They say it's bad luck to cross her. Are you still doing tai chi? Huh? - Tai chi. - Oh. Oh of course, every morning. I run everyday. Dr. Chen says my heart's as strong as a turtle's. Feel that? Just like a turtle, right? She doesn't know that he's the Emperor because he's in peasant clothes. That's why she can be so forthright. She still loves him though. Wait till she discovers that she's been lied to. She will never trust him again. Eh, it's not like that. What do you know? Have you ever been with a woman? Yeah. When? Back home. Just once. A prostitute? No way, I don't need to pay for women. Hmm. Was she pretty? Yan Yan. She's really pretty. Hmm? Wait, that's it? I need to take my bath. Then we can watch the next one. No starting without me! Okay. Hello. You saw the beta? How come I can't log in? Just a second. Gong, can you hear me? I'm not sure when I'll be back. Whoo! Little Handsome! Little Handsome! What the hell. Grandma Wong! - Where's the money? - Get away from me! Where's the money? Tell me! Tell me! Where is the money? Grandma Wong! Tell me! Where is the money? Where is the money? What do we do now? Big Pong! Big Pong! What do we do? Should we move him? - I don't know. - Huh? You haven't done this before? You... you... Maybe you should call someone? No? Okay. Forget it. Hey, help me! - Come here and help! - Hmm? It's not your fault. I was almost killed. We should tell Sister Fong. Ok. Why? She'll find out anyway. She always finds out. Hmm. We should tell her to give you a raise. She won't be happy. We shouldn't create direct conflict with the Red Dragon. Well, we won't tell her then. This can't be... I... I don't know... This really can't be. You saved my life. Don't worry. You're a good boy. Let's act like nothing happened. Pong, would you like some more water? - Huh? Thank you. - Okay. So, how did, uh, how did you two meet? Are you Grandma's boyfriend? Grandma has a boyfriend? Guys. Can you let us talk, please? Grandma, are you okay? How long have you been in the States? Uh, is your ankle bothering you again, Ma? I'm fine. Wait. What did she say? She says you should learn Chinese, bendan. - Hey. - Big Pong likes Beyoncé. Who doesn't like Bey? - I don't. - She's a little fake. Ma, I, uh... I hear you and Big Pong took care of that guy. How did you do it? Huh? I... I said I heard that you and Big Pong's dad were old friends in Jiangsu. How did you meet? Big Pong. Wake up. Wake up! Wake up! Hey, I'm done. Hey. Wait for me outside. Did you hear me?! Dr. Yi says the steam promotes blood circulation. Opens the airways. Completely agree. Feels amazing. Do we know each other? We haven't met before. But I feel as if I already know you. Sister Fong... I haven't decided what to do with you, Grandma Wong. Things are... very tricky now. So many things happened. What? What's happened? Could you explain to me... Oh yeah, I heard you had an unlucky night at the tables recently. Perhaps you borrowed some money? I've never borrowed money from anyone. But if you did, I completely understand. After all, your husband left you with such a mess... You don't know anything about me! I know that if you want to do something, you have to do it yourself. Isn't that right, Grandma Wong? You can't trust anyone these days. My accountant, for example. White Peony tea for stress. Thank you, Mei Mei. How are you feeling? Very relaxed. Then you wouldn't mind if we took the temperature up a little? Whatever you want. Grandma Wong, how about letting my personal driver escort you? To make sure you're safe. You're too considerate. I have Big Pong waiting for me. Hmm. Sister Fong. Sister Fong. Grandma Wong - Sister Fong. You must have heard about my reputation. I don't listen to gossip. Here's the thing, Grandma Wong. If you respect us, then we'll respect you. But if you don't, then... I can't guarantee what will happen. But - Who knows? Maybe that's just gossip. Sister Fong wants me to escort you home. Where is Big Pong? He's not feeling well. What's wrong with him? Wait a minute. - Hmm? - I'm going to the bathroom. Hey, Grandma Wong! Grandma Wong? Hello? Hey, Grandma Wong? Oh! Oh, sorry. Hey, Grandma! Where did you go? I was looking for you. Where did you go? You were supposed to be responsible and escort me home. Ok ok. I'll take you. People are chasing after me! Who? The Red Dragon, those gangsters. Shit! That's the Red Dragon! Oh shit! Hurry, hurry, hurry! Run faster! Hurry! Run faster! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! We have David. Bring the money. 5pm. 17-34 Hester Street. Where have you been? Sister Fong sent me on an errand. You're my bodyguard! You're supposed to protect me! They took my grandson! Didn't you say you had no money? This is my husband's retirement money. Grandma... This is Zhongliang money. No. Red and gold band. Zhongliang money. How did you get this? Who cares! They took my grandson! Understand? Because of you! Isn't this what they were looking for? You... you made me hurt people. It's fate! Fate? Yes! What do you know?! Huh? You're just a gangster. You don't know what it means to work an honest job. Help me. What are you doing? I'm taking this to Zhongliang. Sister Fong needs to know. This is not your money, old woman. Let go! I... I don't want to hurt you. 40 years! We were together. Working side by side. Everyday from morning to night. There was no rest. I trusted him. But after he died... I found out he left me nothing. How can there be nothing? You have to have... something. I brought it! Grandma Wong! Look at how much trouble you've caused. Where's my grandson? Where's Pockmark? David! - David! - Grandma, set down the bag. You let him go first. This isn't a negotiation. What if I hand it over, and you hurt him anyway? What would I do then? Or what if I kill both of you and then take the money? What would you do? Ok! Ok! Ok! Ok ok! Drop it. Okay, okay. Okay. What are you doing? I already told you! I didn't take your money! Damn it. Where is my money? How about a trade? I told you, it's not a negotiation. Let him go, and I'll work for you. I won't rest. From morning to night. Grandma, you're old. What are you going to do? I'll do anything. I'll cook... ...do laundry. Whatever you want me to do, I'll do it. I'm begging you... I'm begging you... I'll be loyal to you for the rest of my life. Get up! He's a good kid. He has nothing to do with this. I'm telling you the truth. I didn't steal Sister Fong's money! Still pretty sharp, aren't you? Maybe you're not so old and useless. Let go of me! Get off me! Let go of me! Grandma, help! Grandma! Grandma, are you okay? Come on, let's get you out of here! Come! Grandma, you have to stay awake. Keep your eyes open. If I die... No, Grandma! I'll give you my apartment. You're a good boy. You protected an old woman. That girl - what was her name? Hurry up and marry her. Live a good life. Make large babies. You don't say "hi"? Hi, Grandma. Grandma, can I see your wounds? Luna, we're not talking about that, remember? Ma, they don't need to see that... Okay. Gross. Mommy said that greed makes people do bad things. Peter. - Should we do presents? - Yeah! Do I get a present? No, 'cause it's not your birthday, Dumbledore. Honey, don't call him that. Open mine first. Wow. What do you say? Thank you, Grandma. Do you want some cake, Ma? It's sesame, not too sweet. Do you like it? Uh, it faces west, it's right next to David... You can't have an altar in the bedroom! Really? Of course! You can't be naked in front of the Buddha. It's disrespectful. No respect. Can't believe you still don't know this. Ma, come on. Last one. Good? The last one. I should get going. Mom... I really... I really do want you to stay, you know? Will you think about it? I will. Peter, Luna!
