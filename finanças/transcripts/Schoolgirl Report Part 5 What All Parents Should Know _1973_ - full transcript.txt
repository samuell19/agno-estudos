Schoolgirls, schoolgirls, schoolgirls. They're our subject: 16, 17 and 18 year-olds. They're growing up in a new world full of questions, problems and ideas... ...unknown to their parents. Boys see them as sex objects... ...with long legs and big tits. Adults think they're uppity, poorly-raised, uneducated, overgrown chicks. Let's try to tell the truth in this film once again... ...as candidly and openly as we did in the four previous Schoolgirl Reports... ...often criticized and attacked... ...but watched by more than 20 million enthusiastic viewers around the world. These schoolgirls, they do cause problems! I've been a teacher for 26 years. You wouldn't believe the stories I could tell. I must tell you one story, because it really takes the cake. For once, I wasn't the young women's target. Rather, it was Mr. Fliederbaumer, a charming junior teacher... ...who had joined us on a school trip. I must tell you, Mr. Fliederbaumer, you've been a pleasant surprise. When I first saw you eight weeks ago in the school yard... I must confess, I had serious concerns. Purely superficial... You didn't seem cut out to be the kind of teacher... ...who could stand up to these precocious creatures. I'm not made of stone, you know. Of course not. You're more like an iron man. You may be conciliatory in form... ...but concerning pedagogical matters... ...you're as hard as steel. I'm glad of that. These delicate flowers who have been entrusted to our care... ...need firm support. Just look at the jungle our world has turned into. I feel sorry for Fliederbaumer. The whole time, he has to listen to the stupid babbling of that Berghold. He's just my cup of tea. Maybe so, but he's out of your reach. No, he's not! He knows better than to get involved with a student... ...facing charges of rape and so on. Nonsense! A man's just a man. And a man's fire simply needs to be stoked. Once he gets a hard-on, his mind switches off. - You'll have to get it up first. - I will. - I doubt you can. - Wanna bet? I'll bet you won't. Ten servings of ice-cream if I do it. Ten servings at two marks each. Okay, it's a deal! We both agree, but we'll need some proof. I'll get you proof. But you have to help me out. Let's hurry! We've fallen behind. It's his last day today. Look at the singular beauty of that cloud formation. As the great Schiller said in his "Mary Stuart"... "Wandering clouds... ...sailing through the air... ...if one could wander with you... ...if one could embark with you." I don't know if it will work. Go! Miss Berghold! - Miss Berghold, it's Petra! - Dear God, what's happened? Just what we needed. What's wrong, Petra? Did you fall? I have terrible pains! How did this happen? It just came out of the blue. What shall we do? Can you still walk? No, I can't. I'm sorry for being so much trouble! We have to get her to a doctor as soon as possible. - I'll go look for one. - No! No! I'll be all right, Miss Berghold. I'm starting to feel better. Go ahead with the others. I'll be coming. Lorna and Marianne can stay with me. - Are you sure? - Yes. I'm not so sure. It could be something serious. Listen, my colleague. You don't know this area as well as I do. So you'd better stay and look after her. - Well... - Yes, that would be best. There's a house over there. Maybe they have a phone. I'll take the girls there. Maybe we can catch a ride. Whatever you say, Professor. Ladies, we're marching on! How stupid. Petra is in good hands! Hopefully, we'll come across someone who can help us find a doctor. - Is this okay? - Yes, that's good. Hello? Hello? - Shit! It's locked. - Look, there might be a key. - Here it is! - You're a genius. Please, come in... What's in here? Here... Lay her down on this. Are you feeling better? We're here, and there's a ranger station over here. If you hurry, you can make it in 10 minutes. If your friends call a doctor there, he'll be here in half an hour. Then we'll go get the doctor. Meanwhile, take good care of Petra. - Will she pull it off? - We'll know soon enough! - How are you feeling? - Terrible... I'm so cold! I'm shivering. Oh man, I can't believe this! He's already getting undressed. Hold on... he's just covering her up. - There aren't any blankets. - Now you are freezing. No, I'm a man. Besides, I'm quite hot. I'm also feeling hot now. I think I have a fever. - But your forehead is cold. - Your hand feels nice. - There's that pain again! - Is it bad? - Quite! Can you... - What? Can you put your hand... put your hand here... ...and press down hard? - Is that better? - Harder. Don't move it! You'd better put it... directly on my skin. But I can't do that! You must, or I'll scream in pain! Press hard... harder. Keep rubbing... gently. Go down... down... Good Lord! She's got him worked up now! Want to bet he's already aroused? No need to bet. I can see it from here! Oh, man! Yes, like that! That's good. That's where you need to rub. Yes... right there! Yes... keep going! All the pain is gone... What's wrong, Petra? Did I hurt you? Not at all. It was great! Just the way I wanted it. What? - Then you're not ill? - Of course not! Why did you do it? To get your engine running, you sweet junior teacher. Now you're helpless! And why? I bet my friends that I'd cook you in your own juices. This way you'll have at least one nice memory of our class. - Now you can put my clothes on. - Such a cunning bitch! But you didn't work me up for nothing. I'll teach you a lesson! Man, you can really learn a lot from Petra! He's got quite a tool! I've never seen one so big. It's hard... and he's ready to go! - Let's stop them now. - No, let him get a little first. That'll be better for us... You know what to do... I'm going to grab him now. I want to get a piece of him too! Me too. I can't stand here and watch Petra having one orgasm after another. Let's go! Hello, my friends. If it's the new thing to cure sick people by fucking them... ...then I'll feeling really sick right now! I've got an itch between my legs, too! You cunning bitches! Shut up and fuck me! Off with the panties... now let's get it on! You've had your share! Don't get tired now! Not until you've scratched my itch! The coward is lying on his stomach... ...but that won't help him! - Let's see that tool! - He's mine! Are you all crazy? If someone catches us, I'll be fired! Don't worry... no one will find out! Come on, Doctor! This way, ladies... please! You're destroying me... She's screaming in agony. Hurry, Doctor! - That's nice... - Well, does my teacher need some help? You're all so talented. We need to encourage this. Ladies, stay here and be quiet. Come along, Doctor! What a day! I feel like an oil sheik... Close your eyes to this abomination, Doctor! This is scandalous! And this is the man whom I said was hard as steel? Your assessment was spot-on. My compliments... There will be consequences! But we're on the pill... My God... I can't take this! Air! Haven't you ever seen four people having fun together, Miss Berghold? Put her on the cot... At least I didn't come here for nothing. Now, let me look at your breast... It was clear this would end in catastrophe. The old hag, Miss Berghold, would run to the Headmaster... ...and turn us in. But nothing of the sort was to happen. Miss Berghold said nothing. This picture is 15 years old. The baby is healthy, three months old... ...and weighs about six pounds. And it's a girl. This baby was given the name Margit Maria Kessler. Her godfather was her grandfather, Hans-Jurgen Kessler. Under his care, Margit grew up in a nurturing environment. She paid attention in school, and she was exceptionally bright. Her parents had very high hopes for her... ...but it was not to be. On November 23, 1972... ...the former civil servant Hans-Jurgen Kessler... ...before the second superior criminal court in Augsburg... ...was charged with incest. He was accused of having had a relationship with his granddaughter... ...over a period of several months. The defendant confessed. Under Section 173 of the Criminal Code... ...the prosecution asked for the maximum sentence... ...of five years imprisonment. But then the defense took the floor... Your Honor... ...the prosecution has demanded the maximum sentence for the defendant. There is no doubt... ...that incest, according to our moral concepts... ...is a serious crime that must be punished severely. But what actually happened? According to the evidentiary hearing, it began on August 24, 1971. That evening, the defendant was home alone... ...with his 15 year-old granddaughter, Margit. "Here it can be seen clearly... "...this is the pecking order among these chickens." I'm back, Margit. It did me good to take a little walk. How was your beer, Grandpa? I only had one... ...but you know what I think about alcohol. - What are you watching? - Some shit about animal psychology. If you ask me, it's fucking shit! You may be able to talk like that at school... ...but I will not tolerate such behavior at home. Understood? Sitting on the table isn't decent, either. Why don't you change channels if you don't like this program? When will your parents be back? I don't know. Not before midnight. Those office parties last forever. - Well then, go to bed. - I'm not a baby anymore, Grandpa. What's that got to do with it? When I was your age, I had to be in bed by 9:00. Yes, that was then. What was good then is just as good today. Now do as I say. Good night, Margit. Good night, Grandpa. "Frank, you've come back." "It was a long ride... "...and if it weren't for you... "...I don't think I'd have had the strength to make it." "Like that night on the Red River..." "Frank, darling. Tell me later... "...tomorrow, or the day after... "...after we've fully celebrated your homecoming." "If you only knew how I longed for you... "...for your touch, your kiss." "Remember how I sneezed because your beard tickled me... "...when we had our first kiss?" "Or how I simply melted with joy during our first night together?" "I'll never forget it." "We were at the saloon." "I saw you playing poker with those guys from Missouri." "I'll never forget how you put your Colt on the table and said... "...'I don't play with cheaters.' You're a real man." - Is that you, Margit? - Yes, may I come in? Sure... Well? I'm so bored. Why don't you go to sleep? Sleep? I don't feel like sleeping. So, what do you want? I don't know, but I feel on edge. It's probably the weather. I wonder how my folks are doing at the party. Your parents? Probably having a good time. I've heard there's a lot of fucking going on at those parties. I beg your pardon? Fucking. That's what they call it. Fucking is great. And I've done it, too. But fucking boys is crap. I want a real man. Someone who really knows how to do it. Some classy guy, like John Wayne or someone. Stop right there! It's best if you go to bed now. Which one? Yours, of course. I only masturbate when I can't get anyone to fuck me. Watch your language. If I hear that one more time... Who is influencing you? Grandpa... ...do you like me? I can't believe you'd turn out like this. You have absolutely no shame! I'm your grandfather. Go now, or... Or what? Or I'll give you a spanking. Go ahead. Get out or I'll tell your parents! Then you'll get it. You won't do that, Grandpa. Well, I... You can't send me away. Margit, please. If you leave right now... ...I'll forget about how you've behaved. No, Grandpa. What do you want from me? To sleep with you. You're crazy. What would your parents say? If you don't do it... ...I'll tell my parents... ...and the police... ...that you tried to rape me. They won't believe you. Don't you realize that they'll believe anything a schoolgirl says? Would it be so bad to sleep with a girl like me? Besides, I won't tell anyone. But if you say no... That's blackmail! But Grandpa, you have no choice. You're crazy! Leave your hand there. You like it, and I like it, too. I really love it. Margit, you're driving me crazy. You know what you're doing to me? You little bitch! You are a little bitch. Was it so bad sleeping with me, Grandpa? That night, the defendant had his first sexual intercourse... ...with his granddaughter. Based on the testimony of the defendant and that of his granddaughter... ...who is her as a witness today... ...the relationship between the two lasted about three months. They had intercourse at least once a week... ...or engaged in related sexual activities. The defendant was being blackmailed by his granddaughter. He was wracked by conscience, yet terrified of being caught... ...until one day, he couldn't take it any more. But that's just impossible. It's just impossible. Margit and you, Father? Margit is still a child! Yes, Werner. That's the problem. When I hear myself tell it, it's even hard for me to believe. But if Margit had told you... ...that I had raped her... ...you would have believed her right away. You have no idea... ...how cunning your daughter is. Even so, you never should have done it. Yes, I know it's my fault. I'll pay the price for it. The price? If this gets out, my career is over! - Is that all you care about? - My God, something must be done! We can't go on like this. Of course not. I'll turn myself in. But first, I'll prove to you that I've been telling the truth. How are you going to do that? Here I am, Grandpa. Didn't you hear me? What do you want? My parents are at the movies. We're all alone. Yes, but I'm tired. I just want to sleep. Me too, but with you. Have you forgotten our deal? Margit, come here. I need to talk with you. No... we can do that later! There will be no later. It's over, once and for all. Are you kidding? I control you! So? Come on... - You really think you control me? - Of course, Grandpa. Did you sleep with me or not? Yes, that's true. What would happen if I told my parents? Do you want to find out? Don't be a fool! Margit, it's over between us. Like hell it is! It is over! Grandpa, be nice to me now, or you'll go to jail. You are depraved! You blackmailed me from the start. Of course I did. Otherwise, you never would've done what I wanted. Remember how scared you were that I would tell my parents? You would have claimed I raped you. Exactly. But you don't need to be scared now. No, it's over. You pig! Just wait 'til my parents get home. I'll tell them you raped me! No need to, we already know. What are you doing here, father? Did you see how my own grandfather, the pig... I'm sorry for what I've done. I know what I must do now. That, Your Honor, is the true situation. I only ask that you rendor a just verdict. The court had to consider the evidence. Especially the testimony of Margit's parents. The court sentenced the defendant... ...former civil servant Hans-Jurgen Kessler... ...to one year in prison. It then suspended the sentence. I accept the verdict. I am Gaby Mallrath, a student. I am 16. I like to feel my naked body, because I think I'm pretty. When I walk by the boys on the street, their eyes pop out of their heads... ...and they whistle after me. I like my breasts... ...especially my rosy nipples... ...that get all hard when I play with them. But my most precious possession... ...lies below the fur on my belly. You are beautiful, my sweetness. You feel so soft and warm. I know you've been asleep... ...but I can sense you'll soon arouse. Awakening to a new and different life... ...and you'll bring me pleasure... ...a lot of pleasure. You twitch and burn. You like it when I stroke you. Don't you? Sure, it isn't perfect satisfaction, neither for you nor for me. But it's very... Very... How you quiver. How you begin to tighten up. Happy now, my sweetness? Oh, you cried? Don't be disappointed if my hands can't give you more pleasure. Soon it will be different. Peter will be here, and he'll make us both happy. Peter... ...if only he weren't so shy. I'm Peter Stromberg, age 18. I go to high school, but I hate everything about it. My only interest is in Gaby Mallrath, a student there. But I can't do anything about it. I'm too afraid. I don't know why. I think I'm an attractive man. Do you disagree? You've been so nervous lately. I know why. My hands no longer satisfy you. You're through pretending. You want the real thing. What good is Gaby if we can't do it? Imagine how great it would be... ...if you could finally enter her... ...and give her pleasure with your rhythmic movement. Just this one last time you'll have to make do with the old substitute. Please... forgive me. I can't help myself! That was good. Tomorrow, for the first time, it will be unimaginably wonderful. Tomorrow afternoon you'll be with Gaby at last. But when you eventually find yourselves together in her room... ...things are quite different. You tend to say the wrong things. I don't want to be shy. I know she wants it. Otherwise she wouldn't have invited me here. I have to do something, even if it's wrong. He really needs to get started. We need to hurry. My mother will be back in an hour. Close the curtains. I don't want anyone to see. - Wait, Peter. - What now? - Lock the door. - But no one's here. You never know. I can't wait any longer! Come on! Not with your shoes on. You'll get dirt on the blanket. Okay. Now, my darling... ...let me take off your clothes. Help me with this damned thing! What a fucking contraption! A barrier to love. I've longed for your breasts! Not so hard! You're hurting me. I'm sorry. That's better. - What is it now? - They only fuck in their pants on TV... ...on Saturday afternoon TV. I hope you know how to make love. I'm totally inexperienced. You'll see. I'm ready. It's so small. I thought it would be bigger. Just wait and see. I love you. Don't you realize you're doing it all worng? You're hurting me. Stop! Get off! Shit! - Shit... it's not working! - Don't worry about it. - I'm a failure. - No, we're both to blame. Promise me we'll try again next week. Okay? Just liking each other isn't enough. You also need to have some experience. Experience? Where can I get that at 16? Maybe it would be better if I talked to someone. But to whom? Of course! Our lodger, Mr. Forstmann. He's single, in his mid-40's and quite experienced. Maybe he can help me. Oh! I'm sorry! What's wrong with you, my dear? That's no reason to cry. That's not why I'm crying, Mr. Forstmann. I'm so unhappy. Why would you be unhappy? If you only knew what was troubling me, Mr. Forstmann. With your figure, it must have to do with love. And you can't discuss it with your parents. No. Of course I can't, Mr. Forstmann. Peter and I... we're in love. But you've never been together for real, have you? Yes. I mean, no. We tried, but... ...but it didn't work out. Well, my dear, these things happen. Young boys don't know how to treat such a gorgeous creature. A young girl wants to be taken... ...gently and carefully... ...with great tenderness. Although he doesn't know it, she has taken the initiative. She wants to be seduced, quickly and skillfully... ...without brutality... ...but with a sure hand. She likes that. A young girl wants to be taken, gently and carefully. In desperation, I asked advice from the only woman in my family... ...whom I could talk to about these things: my Aunt Erika. Want a drink? Cheers! I should be going, Aunt Erika. Don't you want to take the book? No, it's too theoretical about teenage love. I know how it works, but... But you were too scared. No, but I did it all wrong. But it's so easy! You have to wait for the right moment... ...and not attack the girl. You must hold her gently in your arms... ...kiss her... ...stroke her... ...and the rest just falls into place. Really. That's the same theoretical nonsense I read in the magazines. Then I guess I'll have to explain it in practical terms. - But, Aunt Erika... - Come... come here. - Aunt Erika... - Let's drop the word, "Aunt." Come... if you want to. You do want to, don't you? Every movement... ...you must experience every movement with your entire body. Do you feel it? - Is it good for you? - It's marvelous! Just let yourself go. Really let yourself go! This is so beautiful. See, Peter, it's so good! You do it so beautifully. I never imagined it was so wonderful. Aunt Erika! Aunt Erika! It's wonderful! Just wait, my child. You're almost there... - Isn't it fantastic? - Yes. It's so wonderful. It's so wonderful. You see, getting started is the hard part. And practice makes perfect. You were so sweet. When I think of last week, you're completely different now. You too. Getting started is the hard part. And practice makes perfect. Where did you hear that? From our lodger. That's funny. My Aunt Erika... - What about her? - She says silly things like that, too. I'm Eva Steiner. I was 17 when this happened. We had religion classes. Every year, the same blah-blah. We were all 17 and fresh... ...especially because our teacher was quite young. Chaplain Steinmann, he was my target. I wanted to get him worked up, to really heat things up for him. He's coming! Keep your cool! Good morning, ladies. Good morning, Chaplain. Please be seated. So, where did we leave off last time? Man was created in the image of God. Man was created in God's image. What's so funny? Quite talented. Should I try and finish it? You wouldn't dare, Chaplain. Any bets? It seems you underestimate me, Eva. What's that? Weird... That's cute. Do you agree, Eva? I assume that's what you had in mind. You were the artist, weren't you? Actually, I had something different in mind. Sorry. You often think of things that are too big for your little head. Man doesn't live by his head alone. Correct. But you shouldn't lose it, either. It could be very unpleasant... ...for everyone involved. Any questions? No? Then, let's start. He won that round. He was an incredible man, and terribly attractive. But you are mistaken, my dear, if you think I'll give up so easily. After all, I'm a woman and I have more effective weapons than you. After class, I waited until everyone else had left... ...the girls and the other teachers. Then, I went to the staff room. Yes? - Eva, what is it? - I really need to speak with you, Chaplain. Does it need to be right now? I'm in quite a hurry right now. I have a problem... ...that I can't solve on my own. Are you sure I can help you with it? You are the only one who can help me! Eva! Before you say more, keep in mind that I am not only your teacher... ...but also a priest, which is a double barrier... I don't care! I don't know what to do! I love you! I love you! Eva! This is madness. Why? Don't you like me? Forget everything... - ...that you're my teacher, my priest. - Eva! Those are only empty words, nothing more! No, they are not empty words, but facts by which I am bound. Now, please leave. I'm sorry to disturb you. Not at all. She was just leaving. I have to go home as well. That very night I had a crazy dream. I don't know, maybe I was mad because he had rejected me... ...but I dreamed I was seducing him. Not out of love, no. But to make him look foolish. In the dream, my heart wasn't involved at all... ...only my senses and body, which I thought was just awesome. I couldn't get over his rejection... ...nor him. Now he avoided me whenever possible... ...which is why I dreamt of him all the more. Both nice and terrible things, but mostly weird dreams. I was full of glee as I toyed with him... ...and with my body, which I offered to him... ...I made a fool out of him. Suddenly, there was this bed to which we floated. But then the others were suddenly there, too... ...half the class. They tore me away from him. They also wanted to have their fun with him. They were stronger than me. They laughed at me. He belongs to me! To me! To me! He belongs to me! To me! He belongs to me! He belongs to me! To me! He belongs to me! To me! When I awoke from the dream... ...I was in a mood I'd never known before. I felt humiliated. My body had been robbed of its natural weapons. That night I pleasured myself for the first time. Why? I could not stop thinking about Chaplain Steinmann. I didn't know why, but I had to get even with him. I picked up a biker. Hello, Chaplain! Hello, Eva. Hey there, you heavenly clown! Say hi to the little baby Jesus for me next time you see him. You don't talk to some people, you black-robed authority jerk? Not to scum like you. Did you hear that, doll? That guy actually called me "scum." - Forget it, Mike. Let's go! - In a minute... Don't do something stupid! No rosary-carrying wimp can talk to me like that! Just a minute! Ever seen this? It's my rosary. You're wearing pants, but nothing in them, eh? No, Mike! Stop! Now get lost! Better watch out. You'll be missing a pair of ears! That's that... I'm sorry. I didn't want that to happen. It's all right, Eva. But I think you should keep different company. From this point on, we'll have to look at the case of Eva Steiner... ...through the eyes of a psychiatrist. We must ask: Why did she want to humiliate Chaplain Steinmann? It was her affection for him, which became clear in her dream... ...when her classmates expressed their desire for the chaplain. She was afraid of losing him. With every defeat, her as yet unknown feelings became stronger... ...which made her come up with these crazy schemes. Good evening. How did you get in here? - Through the window. - And what for? I love you. I want you. Please... I want you to leave. The next rejection. But at this moment, Eva became aware of his feelings of love. You're lying. You don't want me to leave. Yes, I know. You love me just as much as I love you. Just admit it. Even if it were true? It cannot be. Yes, it can. Love me. Just as I love you. Come... Chaplain Steinmann fought hard... ...but he had no chance in the conflict between affection and duty. He was overpowered by his feelings for Eva. I do love you. I knew it. I love you so... "I think it's better if we never see each other again. Goodbye." That next day... ...Chaplain Steinmann had himself transferred to a different parish. He cited inner turmoil. He was torn between his love for Eva and his duty as a priest. But Eva followed after him, and for a good reason. Rolf! I've finally found you. Rolf, I can't get our night together out of my mind. I must talk to you. Please forget what happened, Eva. And above all, forget about me. But we love each other! It cannot be. I'm a priest. Nonsense! I want to live with you. And you want that too. I know it. Neither you nor I can ever forget our night together. It was too beautiful. Don't be so heartless, after everything we had. Eva, please! Don't talk like this. I became a priest out of conviction. I am to remain celibate. You, you, you! What about me? You'll find another man. You forget, as a priest, I have a responsibility to God. I cannot desert and run away at the first difficulty. - I owe this to God. - Sure, keep your conscience clear. - Eva! - I have a train to catch. An abortion clinic in London. Eva! You dropped something. How long have you known? That I'm pregnant? For a week. You really want to go to London to get rid of it? I won't have the child of a man for whom I'm nothing more than a sin... ... who then confesses about me and regrets everything. Forgive me, Eva. If you're saying that only because I'm carrying your child... ...then save your breath! I tried to deny my feelings... ...thinking it was better for you to forget me. And you wanted to go on playing priest, unapproachable, as if nothing had happened. But now that I know you're expecting my child... ...and that you wanted to abort it to protect me... ...I know where I belong. So you'll do like the others. They live with a woman, but no one's the wiser. No. You're too good for that. I'd make a poor priest. I'd rather try to be a good husband. There are other ways of serving God. NO ENTRY DURING CONSTRUCTION! Our next case is the delightful story of two schoolgirls... ...looking for special entertainment during recess. - I hope no one sees us, Uschi. - So what if they see us? You're sure your friends are in there? Yeah, I saw them go in. The boss can... How do you say that? - Kiss my ass. - Right. Time for our break. - How do you know them? - I met Luigi in Baden last summer. - He's a real Italian? - Yes, and he's good! You'll see. The other one's good, too. Shit! No water. - Are you crazy? - Don't complain. It's a miracle. That's odd! Turn on here, water comes out there. Now I can't wash my hands. Why do you want to wash your hands? Why? Where are your manners? Two beautiful girls are coming. You want to touch them with your greasy hands? Girls? Did you forget? They're on recess now. Uschi is so beautiful! Uschi promised she'd bring a girl for you. But Luigi... ...I don't want to do this. I'm not ready. What do mean, not ready? Once you see these girls... ...your pants will come off by themselves! Besides, you'll see. These girls are as hot as Vesuvius! No need for blah, blah, blah. Just touch them a bit, and the fire is lit. I hope this is worth skipping biology class. Sure, you'll get some real-life education! I'd rather have a bite to eat, Luigi. Oh, fuck off! Beautiful girls, and you're thinking of food? But... ...if... ...if they don't like me... Stupid! They're only coming here to get fucked. See for yourself. Come on... Hello, my gorgeous ladies! Yes, here we are. We have a whole hour. An hour! Know what that means? Yes. Let's get to work, then! Come, let's get started with amore! Hey, I'm over here! This is Inge. I brought her along for your friend. Is she any good? She's green, but she'll play along. Okay, fine! She's not for Franz. That would be too much drama. - What do you mean? - You said she's green. So is Franz. Green with green? That would be a catastrophe! What, are you crazy? I came for you, not to teach some damned beginner! Good Lord, do you want to talk or fuck? Don't let the hour go to waste! I'm on fire, burning like Vesuvius! Luigi! Come out here, you rotten bastard! - Are you any good? - I'm a world champion! That's outrageous! All right, come with me. - Me? - Who else? Come here! - What for? - I'll show that macaroni! Is that all there is? It's so small! Like a milk factory! I'll take care of you. Just keep your eyes on me. See these? Now that's an ass! I've got a big horn. Big like no other! There you go. We're getting there. Shit! My shirt is stuck. Now hold me nice and tight. I'll take care of the rest. Now turn around! Problem? It's becoming a giant! Attention! Step back. Here I come! It's a giant! I've never had such a big one! I had no idea I was such an artist. I'm a real acrobat! Why so cold? Wait... Turn around! Compared to you, Luigi is an impotent failure! Impotent? Did you hear that? Now we'll fuck until the ceiling caves in! Luigi, Franz... where are you? Luigi, Franz! Where the hell are those fucking bastards? He's our boss. Be quiet, idiot! I can't help it. When I'm afraid, I get the hiccups. Nice try! Fucking girls and then expecting to get paid. We're almost done, boss. With the work, that is. You bastards! Come out, or I'm coming in! Out! But I'm a guest worker. If I hadn't been young once myself, then I'd really... - Mr. Kiernbaum! - Good God, it's the Director! Quick, hide! Come on, quick! Hide! Mr. Kiernbaum, you know my eyes aren't so good. Ah, Mr. Kiernbaum! Have you been talking to yourslef? Me? That's right. No, not really, Mrs. Director. I'm only conducting some tests. Ah... what are you testing? I'm trying the pipes out. They look all right. Help! Help! Help! What kind of pipe is this? It seems to be dripping. Mr. Kiernbaum, come here! - Did you get wet, Mrs. Director? - Have you found my glasses? Oh, my God! I'm so sorry. I see red! I see red! We'll fix that. Just come with me. We'll just turn on the shower, and everything will be all right. We'll just turn it on a little bit. There it goes. Come, Mrs. Director. We'll be done in a jiffy. This will work like a charm. Don't touch my breasts! I'm not touching your breasts. I'm cleaning your blouse. I'm just looking out for you. Help! That's too much! Turn it off! What's wrong, Mrs. Director? Can we help you? You look terrible. It's lucky we heard your cries for help. And you hurried over here, eh? Good girls. There are still some decent girls after all. My name is Steffi Bornemann. I'm about to graduate. Graduating high school. How ridiculous. I'm already prepared for life. But let me tell you my story. It's not a pleasant story... ...but other young girls should listen and think about it. It was about half a year ago. I was having a cup of coffee. My parents still treated me like a child. Going out at night was forbidden. That afternoon, I met my first man. It would forever change my life. Allow me. You're not much of a smoker. No, I just smoke now and then. You probably couldn't give me a light. Sure I can. I just couldn't find my matches. What's so funny? Some wise man once said that young men and women... ...should never speak directly of certain things. What kind of things? You really don't know? Oh... that. But I didn't say anything. Still... That line about having a light is one of the silliest, yet most effective tricks... ...but I didn't mind. Finally, I'd met someone... ...whom I could talk to about something besides school. I have to admit, I liked him. His name was Edgar Santen, and he was at least 10 years older than me. He paid me one compliment after another... ...he was an experienced man... ...and I felt comfortable around him from the very first moment. I trusted him so much that I went to his place. - Here's to you. - To you. Don't tell me you're a virgin. But I am. Sit down. That's quite something... at 18. You're not drinking. Take another sip... a big one! You don't need to be afraid, sweetheart. I won't hurt you. So, it was about to happen. He was determined to make me a woman. I was actually very happy. Before that moment, I'd always been scared of it. My classmates told me that the first time can be horrible. But with him, I was in good hands, wasn't I? Your breasts are gorgeous! You think so? Try to relax... and enjoy it. Come... I just want to make you happy, sweetheart. That afternoon, Edgar made me the happiest woman on earth! I couldn't get enough, and became his lover. I skipped school, lied to my parents... ...and I would have betrayed my best friends just to be with him. Day after day... ...and each time I needed more love. It was like a high, a drug that creates utmost happiness. This experience changed my whole life. Then came the sobering truth: Edgar had left. In a letter, he told me he was married and had kids. A terrible time began for Steffi. She tried to find Edgar in other men. She took on everyone, hoping she'd find a partner... ...who would make her as happy as the man... ...who had unleashed her sexual passion. I enjoyed them all, did whatever they wanted. But I never reached the same high as I had with Edgar. Hey, that's Steffi... ...from our school. She'll get it. I had no idea that two boys from school had seen me... ...otherwise I never would have returned to school. That morning, our biology teacher sent me to the supply room... ...to get the model of the human body. - I'll fuck you right here. - Are you crazy? You pig! What's the matter with you? You do it all the time. What you do with all those old guys you could do with me. That's it... you only like old cocks! Your classmates aren't good enough for you. That's right. I don't bother with silly boys. Now get lost, or I'll report you! You need to calm down. I saw you last night fucking that guy in a car. If anyone has something to report, it's me. I don't think you want to report me. Go ahead, if you like. But I'm not like that. Bye... Until then, the boys in my class had ignored me. To them, I was a girl who spent all her time studying. I was just another chick to them. But all of a sudden, they were openly interested in me. Imagine, they even invited me to a party. A fancy costume party. Hello? Where are you? Why are you hiding? What's going on? - I thought this was a costume party. - It is. Arno? Where are the others? What is this strange place? This is a warehouse. My father deals in scrap metal. When we're done with you, you'll be nothing but scrap. I'd better be going. Not yet. - You still owe me something. - I don't know what. Think about how you slapped me. - You're crazy! - Not at all. Let me go, or I'll scream. Fine, no one will hear you. What will you do with me? We know that you'll let anyone fuck you. Since we're classmates... ...we should get a chance, too. You're all crazy! Get her! No! No! No! You pigs! Steffi Bornemann, 18 years old. She discovered love at 18. At 18 her passion was aroused... ...which she tried to satisfy with a growing fervor. At 18 she was raped by her own classmates... ...who saw in her a willing sex object. Is she the victim of a chain of tragic circumstances... ...or was she inevitably bound to go down that road? She'll never forget these life-changing events. Hopefully, she'll meet a man who'll make her truly happy. I'm Ruth Schreiter. I'm almost 18. School is difficult for me. You'll see why. Faust reflects all of the substantial human emotions... ...which is one of the reasons why his work will last forever. Take Faust, for example. Faust, the emotional, wandering, searching one... ...who is so bound to worldly things that he sells his soul to the Devil. Take Marthe Schwertlein, the brothel madam. In her, Goethe manifests all the envy of the guilty towards the innocent. Or take Gretchen, who seeks to satisfy an unknown desire. She doesn't know yet that she's after sexual satisfaction like Faust... ...but she may have a suspicion. Like our sensitive one. Ladies, control yourselves. I'm sorry. That was aimed at me. I apologize. Are you the sensitive one? Don't be ashamed of that. The rest of you lack moral maturity. We'll come back to this next time. For what it's worth, I don't care about moral maturity... - ...physical maturity is more important. - You're swine! Just because we're more natural than you, we're pigs? You're the one who isn't normal. I'm just as normal as you, but no one wants to hear your filth. Don't sweat it. I'll bet she pleasures herself at night until her finger falls off. - You're just mean! - So you don't? Be honest. - No! - Yeah, sure! You're too scared to let a man take you. That's also part of moral maturity, you know? - I'm not scared. - Can't you change the topic? God made a mistake with you. He should have given you an altar instead of a pussy. You say you aren't scared of men? Then prove it to us! - How? - Sleep with one. I could tell you anything. No, we'll need details. We need to be sure you really did it. All right, I'll do it. But how can I prove it? There aren't brothels for for women, are there? Listen to her! We'll set it up for you. You want to watch? Don't worry, leave everything to us. I know how. I'm so stupid. So terribly stupid. They tricked me, but I can't back down. If I do, I'm finished. Three days later they took me to a club. They said there was a guy I had to do. One who had already done half the class. I danced with him, but honestly... ...in the magazines, the Casanovas always look different. How do you like him? He's the best around. They call him "Henry the Ladykiller." Every girl wants him, but he's choosy. He did me once. It was simply superb! He's got a huge gun. What else does he do? He's studying architecture. Second or third semester. Do you want to dance, or go straight to bed? Let's dance. You think it'll work? Ruth has held up well. Henry won't reject her. He's the biggest fucker around! Ludicrous situation. What should I do? Take off my slip? Ludicrous situation. I really like her. She's too good for a fling. He's really nice. He'll understand me. Look, they seem to be doing it. I think we misjudged her. - She was waiting for Mr. Right. - No, we didn't misjudge her. She'll piss off henry, and he won't do her. So I take off my clothes. Everyone is bashful. I take off my clothes anyway. Why is she doing that? She's not like the other ones I've fucked. Why did I listen to them? Do you really want it, Ruth? - Don't you like me? - I do. But I don't understand. You're such a great girl, and you don't love me. When I think about it, I could slap myself. It's something like a bet. Did you know that your friends gave me money? - What for? - To sleep with you. Do you have sex for money? I didn't know you, and I thought... What did you think? I'm disgusted with myself. He's so sweet. I could fall for him. - I'll return the money. - No you won't. You'll tell them that you slept with me. Promise me, or I'm done for at school. Promise me! You have my word. They call me the sensitive one. They make fun of me because I'm still a virgin. They don't understand that I'm waiting for the right one. Thus, this story that began with so much sadness... ...ends with true love. I'm in love with Henry, and tonight we'll do it. You understand, right? Yes, we do, because schoolgirls are like all women... ...they want to physically be with the one they love one day... ...for the sake of love that dominates the world.
