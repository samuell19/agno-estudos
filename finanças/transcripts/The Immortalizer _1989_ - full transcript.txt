Help! Help! Let me go! No, let me go! There, there. Now, change is always a little painful. - No! - She woke up on the way in. That's fine. Let me go! That's a good strong body. Dr. price, if you would. Hold her please. - No! - Damn it, I said hold her! No! No! No! J saw her standing on the beach like a Princess in the sun j put my arm real tight around her pizzal what, no anchovies? Darrell, I thought you said that was gonna be an art film. Hey, the director was Italian. And the zombies lived in a museum. Yeah, one with a swamp in the basement. Hm, weren't those slimy swampsuckers disgusting? It was so cool! The bubbles would always ooze up so you know exactly right where the swampsuckers were! That's so gross. Yeah, just like some people's eating habits. Oh, what about the part where he took the girl? He picked her up and he squeezed until everything came oozing out! Oh! Pardon us ladies, family conference with my brother in our office. We'll be right back. And they used to say we could never go alone. Hey, it's so big, I need someone to help me hold it. He means his ego. So, what'd you think? I haven't had time to think. The guy has been all over me the whole night. His hand kept missing the popcorn and landing in my lap. This is my night, man! The charm is workin"! Hey, underneath that cool exterior I know she's hot for me, I know it. Mm-hm. June, I gotta tell you, this guy is not a high class guy. Sorry about that. Oh, don't worry, I can handle him. Not like the last guy, I hope. Hey, that creep deserved a shot in the jewels! Plan ais in effect! Oh god, not plan al yeah, plan a. The couch again? Remember how I took care of you when you were little? Remember when you didn't have a car yet and wanted to borrow mine? Who was there for you every time? So come on, help me out in my hour of need. You've got a new hour of need every weekend. Oh. You're the one who begged me to move in with you. Right. Pure breed, it'll be over soon, don't worry. Hey, besides, I'll do the same thing for you some day. That's the agreement, right? Yeah, well, I want a new agreement. Oh, come on. Let's take a shortcut, it's cold. Darrell, stop it! You know, go down to the beach. Great shortcut. Darrell! Grow up! Shh! Did you guys hear something? I don't like it, that movie really freaked me. Come on, you guys. What's a few lousy sewn up creatures? Hell, there's worse creatures livin' in our dorm. What about Marsha the living brain? Or Bob the library ghost? Or ned the lurch? What was that? Ooh, ooh, ooh! That's not funny. Maybe we should get movin'. Right. Jesus, run, run, run! Hey! Wait a minute, you two! What in the world? Stop, stop! Stop or I'll fire! Bandy, get out there and get those kids in the truck. Hurry up! Get in there, come on, move it, move it! Get in there, come on, move it, freak! Come on, hurry up, hurry up! Shut up! Come on! Get him, Lyle! Oh my god. Oh shit. Lyle, what's goin' on back there? What is that? Forget it. Are they all right back there, Lyle? Hey, shut up back there, you guys! Here you go, buddy. Come in. You must be Dr. Timmons. Yes, how ya doin'? I'm Dr. divine. Well, welcome to the sea view aging therapy clinic. Thank you. I must apologize for these surroundings but we just recently moved and haven't completed our remodeling. Eh, don't worry. If you spend as much money on the furnishings around here as you do on security, I'm sure it's gonna look just great. Yes. Well, we all need protection. We have a wonderful staff here. I'm sure you're going to enjoy working for us. Oh, nurse Blaine, this is Dr. Timmons, our new assistant surgeon. Timmons, this is Monica Blaine. Doctor, the patient has had a reaction. Then reject her and get another. Mrs. latimer won't care. Well, are you ready to work with us? For the right money, I'll do anything, from lobotomies on down. Yes, that's what I like, a motivated doctor. No, a desperate one. Oh, your little brush with the medical board? Actually, that's what I liked about you. It indicates you're not afraid to be unconventional. Why don't we just cut through the crap here, divine, hm? No one's gonna hire a doctor with my troubled background unless they want something illegal done. So tell me, what's the scam here? There's no scam, doctor. Just a lot of surgery like I told you on the telephone. Yeah right. Well, as you know, I don't have much of a choice, do I? The money is very good. Damn straight, the money's good. Now, you must be very tired after a long trip. You're room's on the third floor, I'll join you later. Lyle, did they get their shots? Right, doc, same as always. Good, we don't want any surprises. Hey, nice muscle tone. Any trouble tonight? One little thing. He'll make an excellent treat. See to it, Lyle. Right, doc. - Pretty nice haul, huh? - Excellent. Here's your reward. Lyle. Lyle, let me touch it. Lyle, let me touch it! Don't get sick on it like you did last time 'cause I'm not gonna clean it up! Come on, you guys, move it now! Come on, come on, you guys! Get in. Get, get, get, get, get, get, get! Gotcha! Ow, Lyle, do something! It's a good thing they got the brains of turnips or you'd be monster meat by now. Remember, bandy, these creatures are permanently pissed off. So stay careful! Hey, bandy! - Huh? Bandy, the new creature, it's a woman! Oh wow. You know what that means. Creature feature! Where's the new doctor? Oh, in his room. I didn't want him to see this part, just yet. Oh. Allen, Lyle and bandy bother me. They're a liability. When better workers come along they can easily be terminated... Without notice. I'll go set the ivs up, doctors. Good, come, there's something we must discuss. Mrs. greenwald, she wants a gymnast. Oh, well, maybe a muscular young lady might do. Darrell! Darrell, wake up! June. June, can you hear me? June, come on, we've gotta get outta here. June. June, wake up! Dr. divine, Dr. Price, come quickly! Who's gone? One of the young men. He must have jumped. I'll go downstairs and check. Finish anesthetizing the others. Doctors, doctors! Doctors, doctors! Doctors, doctors, doctors! Coming, I'm coming. Who are you? Help! Help, somebody, help! An intruder, help! Get him, Lyle! I got him, I got him! Hold him, bandy! All right, after him. Check down the block! Get back here, Lyle, I got him! He's gettin' away! Stupid shit! Police, freeze! I know, I know you're the police, I called you here! Turn around, face the wall. Go on, spread against the wall! Go on, spread it out, spread it out. Please, you gotta listen to me. I broke that window so you'd get over here. Yeah, and you're gonna pay for that. You know how much those damn things cost, huh? - Sheriff, will ya listen? - Stick your hands behind your back. My friends have been kidnapped. That's a cute story. Kidnapped by who, huh? I don't know what they were, big monstrous guys. They kidnapped us in the city and drove us out here to an old house! Yeah, sure. Just calm down, kid, you'll be all right. Will you at least let me explain? Sheriff, there's no time to lose. We've gotta get my friends out of there! We'll do first things first. Let's just give you the old breathalyzer, okay? Though I doubt it'll check out anything that's in your system. Go on! Nurse Blaine, come here. Clean him up, he's a mess. Yes, dear. Don't call me that while we're working. Yes, doctor. This one may have brain damage. Not important. This one is lovely. What's so special about her? Beautiful features. Perfectly proportioned body. And the blush and innocence of youth. Yes, we all lose those qualities when we mature, don't we? Exquisite. She'll be the first to go. Sheriff, please, you gotta check out my story. Call the city police, ask about that cop. Please! It's all gotta keep until tomorrow, boy. They'll die unless you do something. You know, you seem like a bright young kid. Why do you wanna mess with drugs at your age, huh? And we'll talk about this in the morning, after whatever you've taken wears off. Sheriff, they're gonna kill 'em! The monsters? Hurry, Lyle! Hurry up, Lyle, she's winning! Oh yeah. Wow, she is tough! She just ripped bubba's ear off! It's a good thing they can't feel any pain! Hey, give 'em somethin' to really fight about. Let me, Lyle, please, please, let me, please! Ah, okay, go ahead. Son of a bitch! They obviously ain't gonna kill her. So what are we gonna name her, huh? You're better at names than I am, Lyle. You name her. - Yeah? Okay. Let's call her queenie! Yeah, queenie, that's it! Huh? You, I warned you about coming back in here now get out! And if I ever catch you in here again, it'll be the last time! I'm terribly sorry, Mrs. peabody. We, uh... - All right, nevermind. You mean I can have any one of these? Of course. Oh, she's beautiful. Who is she? She's phi beta kappa, model student. I'm not buying her brain! Oh, what a beautiful complexion! She looks so innocent. Many of them look that way. Wouldn't you like to see the blonde pianist we picked out for you? Oh, why yes! Oh. She's gorgeous! And I've always wanted to have blonde hair and blue eyes! But... I just don't know. What if I change my mind after surgery? In that case, you can simply buy another body and we'd put you in it. All right. I'll take... Her! Everyone always called me a shrew! I just want to look sweet! But, you know, Mrs. peabody, blondes do have more fun. Take it from one who knows. Well, I've always wanted to have fun! I think you've made an excellent choice, Mrs. peabody. Now come, let's prepare you for surgery. Yes, I'm ready! Feel any different today? Sheriff, you've gotta let me outta here. They're gonna kill my friends! Yeah, well I know something's goin' on with you. I talked with the city police. They said a cop disappeared in that area last night. You got something you wanna tell me? I've already told you everything I know. And I'm not crazy or a doper either. Did you call the school? Yeah, I did. They confirmed you're a student and also verified your friends' names. So, I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. Turn around, put your hands behind your back. Why? Well, for one thing, you're in my custody! For another, there is a missing cop. Now, you wanna show me this house you said you went to see or not? Yeah. Turn around. Sheriff, I can't go in there like this. There you go. Thanks. Sheriff, how nice to see you. You too, Monica. Sheriff, she's one of 'em. She's one of the ones who loaded us onto those carts. Look, this boy seems a little disoriented. Says his friends are inside here. You mind if we come in? Of course not. Thanks. There was a truck parked here. And they took us up through those elevators. What kinda truck was it? I don't know. I didn't have time to look. Well, that helps a lot. Does the clinic have a truck? No, we just hire ambulances. Would you like to see the upstairs, sheriff? Yeah. I'm tellin' ya, they're downstairs. Now, let's just see. Now, watch. We've gone through a lotta trouble with this old place. Soundproof the walls and added some nice touches. Very nice. This isn't it, sheriff. Come on, let's go, kid. Son of a bitch! June! June! There it is, sheriff! There was a door therel there was a door there, I swear it! June! Darrell! Celia, somebody, answer me! Come on, get up, get up! That's him, he's the leader. He was tellin' 'em all what to do. Well, I certainly hope so since I am the director. Hello, sheriff. I see you have this troubled young man in custody. You know this boy? Yes, I caught him breaking in here last night. Evidently looking for drugs. He escaped through a window. Glad to see you have him in custody. Why didn't you report it? It was late, sheriff, and I knew you were off duty. I was going to call you today. What have you done with my friends! You know, sheriff, we do have a locked observation room for sick patients. If we could analyze this young man for you. Nah, I need county approval to pay for it. In this case, it's on the house. Well, thanks, doc, but I can't. If he escaped, it'd be my ass in a sling. He won't escape. I can't take that chance, doc. Sheriff, let me show you the room where they kept us. Then you'll see who's sick. Nurse, let the sheriff see any room he'd care to. I have work to do. And do be discreet, older people frighten easily. Sheriff, this is it, I remember. Now, that's it, you're outta here, come on! Those rooms were all phony. Yeah, right. They're here, sheriff, locked up someplace. Yeah, that's exactly where you're gonna be if they decide to press charges. Sorry about the disturbance, Monica. No problem, sheriff. Bye. You see, it was all in your mind, huh? Now let's go. I gotta get my friends outta there before they're killed, sheriff! Freeze, mister! Don't move, or you'll never have children. Now put your hands up! I can't! Please, ma'am, I need your help. I don't help escaped prisoners. You saw me over there. You were watching with binoculars. There's no law against looking. So ask yourself, what's a kid doing trapped in an old folks' home? Okay, okay, what were you doing? Trying to get out. And my friends are still trapped in there. They'll die if they don't get out. Please, I need your help. This is over my head, I'm calling the sheriff. Look, you must know something strange is going on over there. That's for certain. I'll be damned if I know what it is. You are about to see the first step in this marvelous transformation. This is my secret brain hormone. When injected into the pineal gland at the base of the skull, this serum transforms and revitalizes the cells of the body to greatly accelerated rate. How did you develop it? You'll know everything soon, doctor. This speeds the healing time of the brain grafts from months to hours. If you're serum can really speed the healing process, we're talking millions of dollars here. Yes. That's true. But the medical community will never accept it. Why not? I'm afraid you're about to find out why. Nurse, fasten his straps, hold him down. Hold him, Dr. price. You too, Timmons. Hand me that strap. We can't hold him much longer. Get the thorazine in him! Give another one! That was enough to knock out 20 men. And that is why the healing hormone will never be approved. Yes. Unfortunately, it affects about one out of every 10 like that. Some simply can't take it. It just interferes with nerve processes. Well, Mr. lord is going to be very disappointed. So what do we do with him now? Let's not concern ourselves with that just now, shall we? Nurse, if you would. Let's continue. We have another one to prep for surgery. Oh, 1 don't know fellas. It's one thing to be on probation with the medical board. It's quite another... All right. I thought you wanted to be a millionaire. But if that's how you feel. All right, I'll do it. Hold her. Just a moment, doctor. There's no need. I'll do it in surgery. You just passed the first test. Fine by me. Gentlemen, let's do some surgery. What do you know about that clinic? Well, it's only been there a couple of months. The jacobsons lived there for 20 years, and then they moved into the city. The next thing I knew, a bunch of carpenters came, they put up that elevator and right away old people in limousines were arriving. Agnes, I've gotta get into that house follow me. We're going to get to the bottom of this. These are my son's souvenirs. I haven't seem him since that clinic opened, and I think they had something to do with his disappearance. Now is my chance to find out. This is what I was looking for! Hello, come in, come in, come in, can you hear me? Yeah, loud and clear. Good, they still work. I'll be able to get back inside! Hold on, you're not goin' over there. I've waited a long time for this. I gotta leave this guy here for a while, bandy. Surgery's starting upstairs, then we'll dump him, all right? Okay, can I help? Not now! Just stay here and stay outta trouble. Okay. Allen, I need to talk to you. Don't Allen me, we have work to do. All right, if you won't talk to me privately, I'll discuss it with you right here! Now you've got to give her to me! She's been selected by a client. I don't care, I want her! Because you want her. Monica, this is strictly business. Don't give me that. I know you, we've been together far too long. Yes, perhaps. This happened once before, remember? Oh yes, I remember. And as I remember you got what you wanted. But now is not the time to discuss it. I want her, Allen! And I have a right. Business is business. Hold her. Get her! Wonderful, now she's damaged goods! Oh really, what a shame. Ready, doctor? Yes. Now for the microsurgery, doctor. We regraft the nerves and the brainstem back onto the brain. Come closer. I'll go see who that is. Yes, may I help you? How do you do? I'm Agnes Van peebles, I've come about your clinic. I see, one moment please. Would you care for some coffee or tea? No, thank you. I would like to inquire about your services and prices. Oh, we're very expensive, but we're worth it, I assure you. Who referred you? She prefers to remain nameless. I'm sure you understand. Yes, I do. The price for our service is a flat fee... $1 million. Our clientele, Mrs. Van peebles, is very exclusive so naturally you understand if we will need some references. If you'll just fill this out for us. And when you're finished... She's gone. I'm going to investigate. Nothing down here, I'm going upstairs. Oh. Oh. Oh! You won't believe what I saw upstairs. I'm gonna look around some more. I'm in the room off the kitchen. There's a hole in the floor here but there's no sign, anything. Oh, you poor dear. What have they done to you? Here, you hang on, you hang on. I'll get you out of there, you just hang on. Just hang on now. That's the price of curiosity. I'm gonna get you, boy! Hee-yah, yah! Agnes, what's goin' on? Are you all right? Agnes, can you hear me? Agnes? No, no, no. No. No, please, no. Lyle! Lyle! I didn't mean to zap you guys. I really didn't mean to, honest. Please, please, don't! I didn't mean to zap you guys. No, no! No, please! Stop! Jesus! Jesus, Jesus. Doctor! Doctor, come quick, there's a creature loose down there. All right. Let's get some help, you get the props. Yeah. Price, Timmons, come join us! What's going on? Shut up and follow me. There's a creature loose down there. Here. Creature features. Where's bandy? Bandy, bandy. Bandy, oh my god. What do we do now? That woman was sent here. Somebody knows about us. But they're amateurs. So let's finish with our surgeries and get out of here. What if somebody shows up? Well, then in that case, of course, we'll be ready for them. Timmons, are you with us? Yeah, I guess I'm in it too deep now. You're a bright man. Let's go everybody, we have work to do. Somebody's breached the side door! Timmons, come on! Agnes? Our young friend returns. Stay where you are! Do you realize you're trespassing? Where's Agnes and my friends? Oh my god. Hello again, and welcome to monster land. Darrell? Darrell? Get away from me. You scum! You maggot! I'd watch my language if I were you. It upsets the creatures. Darrell, it's me. What have they done to you, man? I'm afraid he doesn't remember you. They have no memory? No, not really. But each one of them has the strength of 10 men. And any wound they receive just heals almost immediately. But what about the girl? Only way to kill one is make it lose a massive amount of blood, very quickly, as you just witnessed. The perfect soldiers, wouldn't you say? Doctors, we're ready for you again in surgery. Right, let's go, hm, too bad,. Good TV's hard to find. Everything go all right? Perfectly. The young boy that got away, he's back with us. Good, good. But hurry up and scrub up again. We've got a lot of work to do today. Timmons. All right, over here. All right. All right, push. That's it. Timmons, I like the way you operate. You're going to do fine, just fine. Your motor skills are very good. Well, thank you very much, doctor. Surgical skills like yours I can definitely use. Well, like I said, doctor, for the right money, I'm all yours. Oh, the money is right. You know, I've been looking for someone like you for a long time. And I'm old, and I need someone to carry on as me. You mean, for you. No, I mean as me. No. Okay, let's get him up onto the table. There. Now let's see if he can take the pineal enzyme. It looks like a go. Excellent! Excellent! Let's get started. I'll see you tomorrow. Well. This looks like the big one. That's right, Rudy. Let's do for him just like he's done for us. While he's sedating, I'm gonna go check on Mrs. peabody. Mrs. peabody, you shouldn't be out of bed. I feel fantastic and I wanna see it! Of course you do, I'll get you a mirror, but now in you go. I don't need your help. My god, do I feel wonderful! There's no pain and my arthritis is gone! Well of course it is, you're a brand new person. I am sorry we couldn't give you the body you originally selected. It was damaged. I don't care, I love it! This one's fine, it's incredible. How soon can I leave? In a few hours. Normally we like our patients to leave at night, but we've decided to vacate the premises. We've called your chauffeur. All right, and how will I find you again for my followups? We'll be in touch with you. Are you satisfied with her, Mrs. peabody? Very, she's what I've always wanted. Then... Oh yes, the rest of the money. Here, the other 900,000. I'll need new clothes. I can't walk out wearing my old dresses. We have new clothes for you. I only wear designer clothing. I know that, Mrs. peabody. We've arranged for it. Now, you just get some rest. Darrell. Darrell, it's me, your brother. Come on, Darrell, remember me. Okay, Lyle, take him away. And remember what I said. Yeah, right, doc. Come on, doctor. Rudy, you shouldn't have done that. I'm a scientist, Monica, I love to experiment. Yes, you do. Well, all done, he's a new man. He'll be unconscious for at least five hours. We have plenty of time. I need your help, Rudy. Anything. I want that girl's body. Which girl? You know very well which girl. I can't, Monica. We have to do what Allen wants us to do. He loves her. Have you seen the way he looks at her? It's just an infatuation, Monica. Well, what if it's more? I'm getting old, Rudy, old. I'm sorry, Monica. I don't dare cross him. No? And having an affair with me isn't crossing him? Just what do you think he'd do if he found out? - You wouldn't. - I will. I need to be as young as he is, Rudy. He can't leave me behind. I love him and he loves me. Yes, his mistake. You men, you are such hypocrites! I told you that he gives himself totally to his work and only partly to me. He's a genius, Monica, a genius! Fine, I understand that, but I have my rights too. And besides, that's why I have you, Rudy. Just think of the good times that you and I will have when I'm in her body. Well, maybe I can risk it. Fine. I'll go get her. I'll have to release Mrs. peabody. Good, then I'll have everything waiting for you in surgery. Mrs. peabody, is that you? I mean, I know you were having plastic surgery but... George, please call me Ethel. Goodbye, doctor. Goodbye. I don't know how you did it, doctor. You. Who the hell are you? What the hell's goin' on here? What are you doin' in my training cage, huh? Why don't you come throw me outta here? Well, you little punk. I'm gonna enjoy watching them tear you apart. Yeah, yeah. Well. What, do you wanna come out now or stay in, huh? Darrell? Darrell? Darrell, help me. I'll have to perform the switch all by myself, you know. I know, Rudy. I'm not worried. Was that a creature? Jesus. I can't find 'em! Maybe they went outside. In any case, we gotta get outta here. Out, get outta here! Get in the elevator! Forget about her, get divine and the other clients! Shut up, Rudy! Good day, gentlemen. That's it. Let me speak to sheriff gantry. Dr. divine. Remember me? You killed them all, didn't you? June. Celia. My brother. My body, my body, what have they done to my body? I'll kill 'em. My god, I hurt all over. My joints ache, my back is screaming. I'm old! They put me in this old body! Oh my god! Stop right there. Who are you? I'm Jerry Timmons, but they tricked me. They took away my body! I'm old! You've got to help me! But you helped them, didn't you? You worked for them. Well yes, but they tricked me. Listen, I need to have my body back. Help me! Well, well. Our young friend, you have caused us all a lot of trouble. Now do us all a favor, step back. No way. Step back or I'll blow you back. Good. One more please. One more please. No! No, you can't have her! Start the truck. I'm not leaving without the girl! Go back! Come on out, young man. Come and get us! We want the girl! Gregg! It's okay. It's all right. I'm not him! I tell you, I'm not him. My name is Jerry Timmons! Fine, pal, just show us some ID, okay? But he's taken my identity, don't you understand? He's taken my body! Okay, buddy, the car's outside! That's the last of 'em, sheriff. What a mess. Okay, I think that's enough for now. Sheriff, I'm tellin' ya, there's more to this. Where's the nurse? And what about the other doctor? The one you've got isn't him. You've been under a lotta strain. You just don't get it, do ya? You don't get it! You just don't get it! Hello, I'm Julie mclaren. Oh yes, our new nursing assistant. I'm Dr. divine, how good to see you. Nurse Blaine is going to love you.
