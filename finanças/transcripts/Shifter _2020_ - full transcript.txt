Ten, nine, eight When I was little I had an old music box. One day it got knocked off the shelf and one of its sides split open. I could see the inside; all the gears and mechanics. I took it all apart, examined every piece, and then put it all back together again. When my dad saw what I had done, he asked, "Why?" I said, "Because I realized I could." Holy shit. Hello? Hey, it's Theresa. - Huh? - From work. Oh, okay. Um, I was thinking about going out tonight and I was just wondering if you wanted to join me. Tonight? It's kinda late for that. Yeah, um, I'm just celebrating, so, um... Is it your birthday or something? Uh, um. You're right, yeah, it's, it's probably too late, so just nevermind. Um, sorry. Hey, what can I get ya? Oh, um, champagne, please. Thank you. Did you get stood up? Oh, uh, um, no, I'm not waiting for anybody. I didn't think so. I've seen, seen you a few times around here. - Always alone. - Oh. You from around here? Um, kind of, just outside the city. Ah, the farmland. You're a country gal. Not really, um, my dad just thought he was a farmer. And he wasn't? He was not. What's he do now? Nothing. Uh, listen, it's getting kinda loud in here. You know, my place is just up the street. You know, we can talk a bit if you want or we can kinda go there and have some drinks. Oh, um, actually I think it's getting pretty late. I better go. Seriously? Yeah, I think so. Can you believe this bitch? You're right. The world isn't ready. Here's kitty, you're so cute. I love you so much. Kitty! So, what'd you tell him, can you tell me? I mean, what can I tell him? I mean, he's the one screwing it up, so it's on him. Yeah, but it's just hard to talk to him sometimes right as he gets in. But did you highlight it for him? - Of course I did. - Yellow or orange? Okay, it's yellow. Maybe it's because it was yellow and he just... You know you have... - Thought maybe that... - To do the orange one. I specifically said, "Gary, sign all of these um, yellow." Hey, um, Theresa. That was you that called last night, right? Um, oh, uh, yeah. So, did you go out? Uh, oh. Um... Well, happy birthday or whatever. Happy birthday. Heard about the stunt you pulled the other day. You know, you may be smart, Chaney, but you can sure do a lot of stupid shit. These machines are dangerous! They'll rip your damn arm off if they get the chance. God dang it. If someone's wrong with one of 'em you call me, and then I call the people who know what the hell they're doing and they will fix the machines. You are not allowed to crawl inside the damn thing and try to fix it yourself. I... No, I don't wanna hear it. Pull another stunt like that and I'll rip your damn arm off myself. Okay, I may be small, but I can rip a damn arm off. Now, get back to work. Miss Theresa, I brought tomatoes! So, how are things down at the factory? Fine, I guess. Got any weekend plans? Just some work around here. Now, a girl like you needs to go out on the weekends, find yourself a nice man. I have plenty to do around here. Well, it must get lonely sometimes being here all by yourself. You need to find somebody and bring 'em in and help get this place up and running again. Hm, you know, when I was a kid, about 10 years old, my friend lived in this house. Now, this was way before your family moved in. Must be 1967, '68, somewhere along there. But she swore that this place was haunted. She said they would hear sounds and screams, but they never knew what the source was, but one night they saw a, oh, an apparition right here in this very room. Said they'd never seen or heard nothing like it. Have you seen or heard anything? Of course not. Well, they heard something because they moved out of here mighty quick. Now, you know if you ever need anything, I am happy to help. Actually, if you could please hand me... Toodaloo. Hi, uh, you can just go ahead and have a seat and we'll be right with you. You still tinkering with old junk in that barn like you used to? It's good to see you again, T. Listen, I know it's been quite a while since your dad's funeral. I'm real sorry I missed it. I had to work, you understand that, right? You see, when his dementia kicked in I had to find work elsewhere. That's just a fact. I swear I woulda helped out if I could've. I was sure praying for you though. You do this all the time. Not all the time. Yeah, all of the freaking time, yes. You're like , I'm Blake the flake, Sam, here's my workload. I need to take a break for a family emergency dinner for homework, I got a new porno mag to read through... Okay, okay, okay, I know, I'm sorry. It's just I really need to get this project done. I'm pressed for time and the deadline's coming up. I just really need this, please. Sure, Blake. Quantum physics, that's heavy stuff. Hello? Hey, uh, is this Theresa Chaney? Um, yes. Oh, great, hi, Theresa. How's it going? Uh, who is this? Oh, dammit, I'm sorry. This is Curtis Mathers. Oh, hey, Curtis. It's been a long time. Yeah, too long. Um, look, so, I'm going to be the city tomorrow, and I thought that just well, I thought of you, and I thought maybe, you know, if you were free maybe we could uh, you know, go out for a drink or whatever. Oh, um, uh. It's okay if you can't. No, I mean, uh, I'd love to. Theresa Chaney, is that you? It's me, it's me. Wow, you look, wow. Well. Would you like to, yeah. You seem a little nervous. Everything all right? Oh, I just um, I don't go out on dates very often, so. What? A towering inferno like you? A what? A towering inferno, 'cause you're tall and hot. Oh. Just loosen up, we're gonna have fun. What have you been up to? Um, well, um, you know, a little bit of this and that. Actually, lately, I've... Oh, yeah, I meandered around too, and then after college I got job and everything just sort of fell into place. But you're a smart girl, you will get there. Where did you go to college? Um, I didn't go because of my dad. Ole' oddball Owen Chaney. How is he doing? Uh, he passed away. Um, right after high school he got really sick, and I took care of him until the very end. That sucks. Yeah, I never wanna be a burden like that to anybody. Goddammit, I uh, I'm sorry, I um, I have to take this. Sorry, that was just a little work thing. What the hell? Okay, yeah, uh. I know, so, I have a friend at the office and he was really needing his ring resized. Said he was a pickle, a friend of mine he's a freak. And I didn't tell him that. And uh, hi, guy, who does that? It's a race, that's all. My guy. Anyway, what were you saying? I have to go. I don't know how long it's gonna be. I cannot do this again with you. No, I cannot. I can't, I'm sorry. Okay, well, I can't do this right now, okay? Wait. Hi, hi, hi. How are you? Yeah. Don't ever let me do that again, okay? Bernard. Bernard. Isn't that weird? Are you eating all of those tomatoes? What are you looking at? Huh? Huh, kitty? I love you, yes I do. I love you and I hug you and I squish you and I kiss you, and I'm gonna bop you in the nose. You're the cutest little kitty in the world. Even though you have a stinky booty. Were you drinking that night? No. Drugs of any kind; prescribed or otherwise? No. Any chance that you're pregnant. - No. - Are you sure? I'm sure. Okay. Are you putting in extra hours at work? - I guess. - Mm hm. Ah, it's stress. - Stress? - Stress. I knew it as soon as I walked in. You see, blackouts can be caused by any number of different things, including stress. So, let's start from there. You need to give yourself a break. You need to get some rest. I don't know, go for a walk, get outta town for a day. It'll be good for you. You know sometimes we just need to relax. Hi, kitty, come here. Yeah. Hi. You the best kitty, yes you are. Not feeling well? What's wrong? What the fuck? I just, I still don't feel well, so I don't think I'll be able to come in tomorrow. Well, it's been almost a week now, Chaney. You're out of sick days. It's gonna start affecting your paycheck. Break time's over, Chaney. Oh, kitty, you're so cute. Yes you is with your furry little feet. Little kitty, oh yes you are, yes you are, you're so cute. Uh, can I help you? Uh, uh, sorry. No, I'm sorry, I just, I don't like people seeing my work before it's finished. I just get paranoid that people won't take me seriously - until I've got it all... - You've got it all figured out. Yeah. I know the feeling. Well, yeah, you know, it's my capstone project and my senior show is coming up and I just don't know if I'm gonna get it done on time. So, are you writing a paper or something? Um, it's not ready for that. What's not ready? Oh, are you okay? I have to go. Shit. I don't now what your problem is, Chaney. You used to be one of our best employees, but now it's like your work ethic is deteriorating and it is getting worse everyday. I just don't know what to do about you. Your production's down, it's causing everything to slow up. What's going on with you? What do you need? What's happening? You're gone all the time. I don't know what to do. Your production is down. It's cramping you up. Everything is slower. You can't afford, I just don't know what to do about you. What's going on? Your production is down. What's happening? It's causing everything to slow up. I have to go. You're not going anywhere. Then I quit. Calm down, Theresa. I know you took it really hard when your dad died, it's time to move past that. You need this job. I have to go. Okay, I think I understand now. Um, the device took us out of our freezer and so our temporal existence is melting. I just need to put us back where we belong. And now we wait. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Your turn. So, it's ready now? Uh, what? Oh, what you were working on. I guess it's ready to be written? Um, there have been some developments, yes. Okay, well, I look forward to reading it, whatever it is. Hey! Hey! - Hey. - Hi. Um, I was just wondering if you know, you wanted to um, go out for coffee sometime? Oh, um, yeah, sure. Okay. Um, how about, how about tomorrow afternoon? We could just meet here. Okay, okay, yeah. - Okay. - Okay. - I'll see you then. - Cool, okay. One, please. The theater asks that you please remain quiet at all times during the film. Mommy. Just watch the movie, honey. Mommy! Surprised to hear from you, Miss Theresa, how are you? Theresa, you there? Yes, um, I'm here. Oh, good, there you are. How about that weather today, huh? Yeah, um, um, I was just wondering... Yes, dear? Um, I was wondering if maybe you wanted to come over. Come over? Yeah, I can make tea or we could um, I don't know. Oh, well, I have got a lot to do around here. Tomatoes are calling my name, you know how it is. Okay, yeah, no, um, no worries. Sorry. I don't remember this. I do. So, you must be ahead of me then? Yes. How long do I have before the next one? Not very long. Need some help? Uh, sure. So, you um, you disappeared. No, I just mean that I hadn't seen you at the library in a while and we were supposed to... Oh, yeah, I'm sorry. I, I've just had a lot going on lately. Yeah, well, um, it's getting kinda late. Wait. Do you maybe want to go out for drinks or something? So, how's your capstone project going? Um, I graduated nearly a year ago. Oh, right. What are you doing now? I'm just kinda taking life as it comes at the moment. I could take up quantum physics as a hobby like you. It's not a hobby. What is it then? A curse. Then why do it? Because I realized I could. Sorry, um, I should probably go. Are you okay? Yeah, sorry. Yeah, just like I was saying. I was thinking about an old girl the other day. Well, well, well, what's up, country gal? Please just let me through. Just please let me through. I don't think so. Hey, man, just let her through. I don't need your help, Blake. Oh, wait a minute. Oh, oh, my bad. I didn't know. This you? Hey, uh, you need to watch out for this one. Just let her through. All right. Hey, it makes so much sense. Dang, you see what I'm saying right there. You should really put some ice on that. I'm fine. - I'm fine. - It'll help it feel better. You shouldn't have done that, you know? Done what? I could've gotten past him on my own. Yeah, but, you didn't have to. Are you okay? Um, there's just a lot going on right now, and it can be overwhelming. Um, I don't have a lot of friends, so. No one to talk to. What's going on? I built something, a device. Okay. And I used it on myself. And now I, I've lost control, and... My body, it's... It's like it's deteriorating. And it just hurts. It hurts so much. What, what hurts? What, is it the device hurts or? No, no. I don't understand. Are you in danger? Are you okay? Is it, what is the device? Just forget I said anything. You can't understand. Just nevermind. Theresa, I want to understand. Just explain it to me and I'll do my best. It's just too much and I can't be a burden, so. Theresa? Who are you? What are you doing in our house? No. Hey, um, is Blake here today? Blake the flake? No, she quit weeks ago. Do you know where she is? Nope. Uh, did she leave any messages for anyone or? Who are you? Oh, hi. Hello. Um, I've come by a few times in the last couple of months, but I guess you weren't here. Oh, I brought you a whole new batch of tomatoes. Uh, well, I can just put 'em out here if that's okay with you. Are you sick or something? I mean, or maybe it's the birthday blues. It was your birthday last week, wasn't it? I, I don't know. Are you okay? Do you need me to help? I'd be happy to help with anything. - Help? - Sure! Good ole Martha's always here for you. You want to help me? Well, of course. I'll help you in anyway I can. Oh, my God. Dad? I'm home. Thought I'd make grilled cheese tonight. How are you feeling today? What is it, Dad? Oh. I will be right back to help you get cleaned up. You can't do this, Ed, not now, please. I'm sorry, T, I really am. After all he's done for you? I gotta go where the work's at. There's work here, I just, I just time to figure things out. I ain't got time to wait, T. Dad was behind on the mortgage as it is, without you we could... Look, I got my own stuff to worry about. This is how it's gotta be. Please, I can't, I can't do this on my own. I am not going to be like you. I am not going to end up like this. The hell, T? Ow! What was that for? Hey, Theresa! Theresa, what's wrong? Your face, do you need help? There's only one person who can help me now. It's okay. Don't be scared. I'm you, but I'm ahead of you. The device works. You did it, but you can't use it. I know you want to, but you can't. Not now, not in this way. Because if you do then you'll lose everything and everyone. But it doesn't have to be that way. You can erase this pain. You can fix this. I need you to make this right. Dammit. Bernard. Bernard! No. No. No, no.
