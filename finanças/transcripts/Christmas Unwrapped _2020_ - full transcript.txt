[chuckles] I got up early. I was too excited. It's officially two weeks until christmas day, which means now I am allowed to put up decorations. A deal is a deal. Wait. Two weeks until christmas? Ooh, that means that janet's gonna pick who gets to write the holiday feature today. It's always work with you. Ugh, what I would give for a full-page spread in the times square journal. It will come. Don't you believe in a christmas miracle? Mm... [instrumental music] charity, tisha! Good morning, ladies. Hey, tom, we miss anything earth-shattering while we were recharging? Uh, most people call that sleeping. -Most people aren't charity. -You didn't miss much. Uh, the financial district held their annual christmas tree lighting last night. Oh, even wall street loves christmas. -How's that for a twist? -[scoffs] oh. And, uh, the mayor is preparing for the city's annual christmas eve gala. Oh, what a dream it would be to get on to that guest list. Why, it's just a party. I'd rather be out uncovering the next watergate like a real journalist. Hey, you are a real journalist. Your blog gets more and more hits every time you publish a new post. No one takes blogs seriously. That's not true. Hold on. I'mma grab a poppy-seed bagel before they run out. [charity] totally. -Morning, tom! Hey. -Erik, how are you? Would you mind if I slide some flyers into today's paper? The kickoff event is tomorrow. -Anything for erik gallagher. -You're the best. You know, you're supposed to go through the proper application process to advertise in the city's newspapers. Well, shoot. I've been caught. You're not gonna tell on me, are you? Yeah, I guess I can keep this to myself. Information is power, after all. Nice. I'm erik. -Charity. -Charity? [laughs] oh, wow, that's, that's funny. -Why is that funny? -Uh, I run a charity. Your name is charity. It's, it's kinda funny... Oh, yeah, a real wisecrack. Okay. Um, here, why don't, why don't I give you one of these... You can drop by. Oh, uh, I don't skate. It's really easy. I could teach you. Thanks. Really not my thing. All right. Well, um... -Hey, ready? I'm all set. -Yeah. Yeah, let's go. Um, good luck with your charity event. Merry christmas. [instrumental music] [indistinct chatter] -ah, good morning, everyone. -Good morning. Well, as you know, for the next two weeks we are going to be in full holiday swing, and that means that our christmas feature article is going to be assigned. And this year we are going to stand out and we are going to uncover something so juicy that this entire city is going to be lined up at the newsstand on christmas eve to buy a copy of the times square journal. That being said, this feature article is going to be focused on 33-year-old erik gallagher. He's the founder of the non-profit, nsb foundation. Nsb stands for never stop believing. Oh, my... That's him. The nsb raises money year-round to put on his 12 days of christmas event. Each of the 12 days leading up to christmas, he does a different event to get people in the holiday spirit. Isn't this the guy that has personalized gifts for hundreds of people on christmas day, everything from a train set to a brand-new car? -And no one can figure out how? -That's the one. It's crazy. How would he know what they all want? Do you think he hacks our phones or something? [laughs] I don't know, what I do know is that everyone calls him santa's number-one helper because he gives away thousands of dollars' worth of gifts on christmas morning in the park to deserving people who believe. And some people even say that these gifts could add up to be in the millions. Where does he get all this money? It can't just be from donations throughout the year. Is he a real-estate tycoon or something? That's the story. We need to find out who is funding him. -Ask if he's single. -Stop. Because when asked, he says, "everything comes from santa." -you still want me to ask? -Did she say santa? He may have good intentions, but we need to uncover the truth and that is going to take real skill. All right, who's assigned the article? Well, it was going to be christine, but she had a family emergency and she had to go to chicago. So this year the article is going to... Charity jones. [indistinct chatter] -me? -It's a christmas miracle. -[gasps] -[laughs] I don't know what to say. I'm speechless. [laughs] thank you. Well, christine suggested you for the job. She said you have a real eye for seeing the truth in a story and your research skills are impeccable. Oh, and she sent me your blog. You have talent. Wow. Thank you. I will do anything and everything to write the best piece imaginable. Now, listen, erik doesn't do interviews, let alone a big article like this, so this is your chance to prove you're a real reporter. And erik only agreed to do this if the journalist chosen participates in all 12 of his christmas events. That's a lot of christmas. -Is that a problem? -No, of course not. I mean, if diane sawyer can go to war-torn countries for a story, I can do this. -[laughs] I like that. -[chuckles] okay, you start tomorrow. I want updates every day. Thank you. ♪ dear santa can you help me ♪ can you believe it? Oh. My first assignment. -Finally. -Honey, I'm so proud of you. I always knew that your curiosity and passion for justice would do you well one day. Remember when your rachel the reporter doll went missing? You interrogated mom and I for over an hour until you realized you left it at school. So it's gonna be hard to take this guy seriously. Apparently, he still believes in santa. Don't write him off so quickly. We all believe in things that others might think are silly. Like that the knicks are the best sports team in history? Exactly. -Hey, it's not funny. -[charity laughs] ♪ glo-o-o-o-o-o-o... ♪ [clears throat] so, uh, how's, how's the cookie? Same recipe? Is that your mother's favorite christmas carol I hear? -[song playing on radio] -wow. Remember how she would sing it with the church choir every christmas eve? Yeah, I remember. Your mother, she had the most beautiful voice... Yeah. Hey, listen, so I should get back to work. I'll give you a call later, okay? Break a leg, honey. Can't wait to read it. Okay. Love you. Love you, too, charity robin roberts jones. [chuckles] ♪ glo-o-o-o-o-o-o... ♪ [laptop keys clacking] a new home? How? Time to find out. [instrumental "joy to the world"] [indistinct chatter] oh! No cutting, ma'am. Oh, I'm here to see erik gallagher. I'm charity from the times square journal. Do you have a media pass? Thank you. He should be on the ice with my daughter caitlin. But you could get a pair of skates from the lady behind the counter over there and join them. Uh, I was hoping that I could just wear my boots. When erik says he wants you to participate, he means it. Okay. [music continues] oh. Okay, watch out. Look who it is. I thought you didn't skate. [grunting] -oh. -Uh... -You okay? -Yeah, uh, yeah. Just never been great at balancing. You mean, your personal and professional life? Yeah, I have the same problem. -Is it that obvious? -[laughs] oh. Okay. Hold on to me. [chuckles] [chuckles] so you're charity jones? All right? Okay, 'cause I was wondering if the reporter who was dropping by today, it would be you. I mean, meeting two different charitys in two days would be quite the coincidence. It's already quite the coincidence that we just so happened to run in to each other the day before I got assigned to follow you around for the next 12 days. [laughs] yeah, that sounded weird. Hey, as long as your inspiration for the article isn't glenn close from fatal attraction, then I think we'll be just fine. Well, don't worry, I'm, uh, more inspired by julia roberts in erin brockovich. Oh, great, I see. Fighting to uncover the truth. I admire that. Though, what exactly is the, uh, contaminated drinking water in this story? -Time will tell. -Huh. All right, well, jokes aside, uh, I'm really excited to have you tag along. Although, whoa... I don't know how interesting of an interview I'll be. Well, with the right journalist, anyone can be interesting. And that's you? -Let's hope so. -Okay. Okay, so how much do you know about me already? -Be honest. -Erik gallagher. Uh, born in new jersey, went to douglas high school, and then columbia. Sometimes referred to as erik christmas in the media. Um, grew up in foster care. And, uh, no job history other than being the founder of never stop believing. That's, that's pretty good. Although I did work at a chocolate shop in my teens. Oh, oh, noted. So can you tell me a little bit about today's events? 'cause I seem to be one of the only people who's never heard of your nsb charity. Or more importantly, this 12 days of christmas extravaganza. Okay, so we've rented out the entire ice rink, free for everyone to use. Uh, the skates are free to rent, too, and even the hot chocolate, that's free. And what's your hope for all of these events? You know, everything is so expensive nowadays that it's unfair to those who just want to make memories with their loved ones. Well, I hope you don't take this the wrong way, but what's in it for you? I just want people to believe. Is it time yet? Uh, charity, this is caitlin. Caitlin is one of my shining volunteers. And, caitlin, this is charity. She's gonna be reporting on everything that we're doing over the next 12 days. I'm not just a volunteer. I'm one of santa's helpers just like you. She's right. Well, nice to meet you, caitlin. I like your mittens. Thanks! I got them from santa last year. I forgot to tell him what color, but he knew. -Uncle erik, is it time? -Oh, yeah. Go, go tell your dad to let everybody in. Here. Come with me. Daddy, it's time! [exhales] this is the best part. [crowd cheering] let's see what you got. Can you do a spin? Wow! It's a pretty great feeling, right? -Excuse me, mister? -Yeah? Are you really santa's favorite helper? Uh, well, gosh, I don't know if, if I'm, I'm his favorite, but yeah, I'm, I'm definitely one of them. Really? You know santa? Like, the real one? -Yeah, the real one. -Okay, cool. Can you tell him that this year I'd really like a scooter? Do you really believe, 'cause santa only grants wishes to those who really believe. -Yes! Definitely! -Awesome. So I'm gonna give you one of these and you can write down your wish on there, find a fireplace, throw it in there. And then the dust is gonna go up the chimney to santa in the north pole. -Really? -But don't lose it. 'cause every person only gets one. Okay? Thank you! Thank you! Merry christmas. Are you sure that's, uh, such a good idea to get the kid's hopes up like that? Santa doesn't disappoint, I can assure you of that. [laughs] okay, tell you what. Um, why don't you take one of these and think of what you really want for christmas and then when you think you truly believe, you can find a fireplace-- okay, I'm just gonna stop you right there. Um, I think we need to get something out of the way. I'm never gonna believe any of this christmas magic stuff. I believe in facts. And that's what this story's gonna represent. I'm glad we got that out of the way. Okay. Let's, uh, let's go skating on some ice. You got it. Come on. You got it. Just, just gotta get low. -No, not, not, not that low. -[charity laughs] [mumbles] [charity] yeah, that's a good... -That's cute, that's adorable. -Okay. [erik] you got it. You're a pro. But you should have seen him talking to this kid. He practically promised him that he's gonna get a scooter. -It's not right. -So what's your angle? Do you think he's part of the mob or something? What? No. No. He seems like he's a good person, but almost too good. Was he as cute in person as he was in his picture? Um, I don't know, 'cause I'm a professional and I wasn't even paying attention to that. You are a really bad liar. -He was that cute, huh? -Stop. Come on, you know, I have gone out with more than a few eccentric guys. I mean, we live in new york. But one who still believes in santa? -Pass. -[chuckles] fair enough. So what's on the schedule for tomorrow? A christmas movie marathon. So he rented out a movie theater and he's gonna screen christmas movies for 24 hours straight, free of charge. -That's fun! -Yeah. Hopefully, I can get some more information out of him. Do you think you could do some research and maybe see if he's got any siblings or find his parents or something? -'cause that would be amazing. -Definitely. I'll search the archives tomorrow. Perfect. Thank you. Oh, by the way, how was your date the other night? Don't ask. He would not stop talking about this ufo he claims he saw. No! But his profile seems so normal. [groans] I'm sorry. That's fine. Better luck next time. Yeah. -[charity chuckles] -oh. Not bad, right? I've got to admit, it looks pretty good. Thank you for picking lights that don't flash. No problem. [sighs] hm? [chuckles] [instrumental music] tsk. Tisha. Oh, hey. Here you go. -Hey there. -Oh, hey. -Uh, charity, right? -Yeah, yeah. Uh, what was your name, I didn't catch it yesterday? -Aaron. -Aaron. Uh, nice to officially meet you. So, uh, you've known erik a long time? Yeah. We met in foster care when I was only nine years old. That's quite the friendship. Erik is more than just a friend. He's a brother to me and a second dad to caitlin. Oh. I-I don't know what your intentions are with this article, but please remember that never stop believing helps thousands of people in need every year. Twisting erik's words or motives for the sake of getting attention to the piece would be a real shame, and could hurt a lot of people. I'm not interested in click bait, you can be assured. I just want to know what nsb really is all about. Besides helping people? I get the impression that you're not so happy that erik agreed to this article. Ah, I'm just watching out for my friend. Erik thinks everyone's filled with goodness. Yeah, well, I, my best friend's the same way, tish. She's just, she's an optimist and a romantic. -You're not? -No. I prefer to live in reality, not fantasy. -Daddy! -Hey. Oh, my gosh, guess what, sarah just told me that santa might be here today, but in magneto. Oh. I think you mean incognito. Maybe he'll sit right next to us during the movie. -Wouldn't that be so cool? -That would be somethin'. Speaking of which, elf is about to start, and we should go get our seats, caitlin. I believe erik's in the theater if you want to come with us. Uh, yeah, sure. Thank you. Hey, erik. Look who we found. -[erik] hey, charity. -Hey. -You made it. -[chuckles] um, I'm glad you're here. This is, uh, this is one of my favorites. You can actually feel, like, all the energy, you know, as they're waiting for the movie. Oh, I know the feeling, I love when the lights dim and everyone gets quiet. It's the best. Hm. What's your favorite christmas movie? Oh, honestly, I haven't watched one in years. What about when you were a kid? I guess we watched, uh, miracle on 34th street every year with my mom and dad, but, you know, it's been a while. Movie about a charming man trying to convince a skeptical woman that santa exists. That's, that's ironic. Oh, you think you're charming, do you? -Hm. -[chuckles] all right, what was your favorite? Probably home alone. I like how even though his parents forgot about him, kevin knew how to survive on his own and was able to find the spirit of the christmas season. Hm. Well, it couldn't have been easy growing up in the foster-care system. It wasn't. But some of my foster parents were really amazing. And I learned a lot, like, kindness can change the world. Hm. So have you ever tried tracking down your birth parents? Why look for those that don't wanna be found? So you've never tried? I thought you wanted to learn about my work with the nsb, and not my personal life. No, I want to learn about you, not just your non-profit. I don't know anything about them. Um... All the documents that I have, their information is redacted. Could I take a look at those documents sometime? They didn't want me. Want to know anything else? No. I'm sorry. Uh, I will drop it. It's okay. Well, um, why don't you just tell me about your parents? I'm supposed to be learning about you. If you expect me to open up, then... You have to do the same. It's only fair. [sighs] my dad was a teacher and my mom was a nurse. They both chose professions that require deep patience and compassion. I admire that. Oh, well, I never looked at it like that. Look at that, I'm starting to shift your perspectives. You just think you're so clever, huh? Okay, my turn, so tell me about growing up, what was your favorite subject in school? -Uh, gym class? -[cell phone ringing] oh. Sorry. Okay, I should take this. -Excuse me. -Yeah. Oh. "dearest erik, everything is coming together nicely. My men will deliver on time and be completely invisible as always. Thank you for your hard work and for always believing. Please destroy this letter at your earliest convenience. Be well, my boy. Kris." what? Hey. Sorry about that. -It was my old boss, frank. -Oh, no worries. He owns frank's chocolate shop in the west village. You've never been? It's incredible! No, I haven't. But everything, everything's okay? Yeah, everything's great. He's, um, one of our oldest donors. He was just checking in to see if we're still good for lunch next week. -So you guys must be close. -Yeah. Frank, um, frank taught me all about how to run a business and most importantly, how to make a really good chocolate truffle. [chuckles] so how to deal in business. So things like how to deal with money? -Yeah, I guess. -Oh. Sorry to bug you, erik, but there are a bunch of kids that want to meet you and get their golden christmas wish. [laughs] all right. Duty calls, I'll be right back. Mm-hmm. [charity] all right, thank you. [gasps] I got something. Hm? Frank murray has owned frank's chocolate shop for 30 years. Specializes in christmas truffles. Perfect! Okay, great. Send me his number. I wanna meet with him. What are you gonna talk to him about? Well, I think he might be in on the whole operation. Have you interviewed his best friend yet? Aaron? No, he won't give me anything. He's too suspicious of what I'm planning on writing, which makes me think that he's probably in on it, too. Hm. Maybe. So what's the latest? Oh, um, well, I am going to meet with one of erik's old employers and see what I can get out of him. Good. Let me know what you get. And I also took a photo of a very suspicious letter that was sent to erik from alaska. -Show me. -Okay. What? It's blank. That doesn't make any sense. Let me know when you have something real. What? [telephone ringing] [door shuts] -sorry I'm late, my dear. -Hm. Things have been so hectic lately, I hardly have time to button my coat. Why, I would imagine this is your busiest time of year. Oh, you have no idea. Well, thank you so much for meeting with me. -I-I really appreciate it. -Well... Anything for a friend of erik's. Now what can I do for you today? Well, um, I was wondering if you could just tell me a little bit about your friendship with erik gallagher. Well, erik's the hardest worker I know and he's so full of kindness and generosity. Ah, from the moment I met him, I knew he was the real deal. Now he helps me bring joy to families everywhere. -[cell phone beeps] -how did you two first meet? Well, it was three days before christmas and I saw him handing out candy canes to everyone passing by. He must have been only 12. But there was something about him. He has this kind of spirit that gives people hope. It's rare to find these days. [chuckles] yeah. And how old was he when he started working for you? Well, he became my apprentice when he was 14 and then my number-one employee soon after. Wow. So you guys have known each other for a long time. So do you know anything about his past? Did he inherit any money or win the lottery at some point? So I'm just trying to figure out how he manages to give thousands of gifts to thousands of people on christmas day. Erik knows what it feels like to have nothing and come from nothing. It's his life's mission to bring magic and hope to as many people as possible so that nobody has to feel alone. Isn't that a good-enough story? I'm-I'm sorry if I'm coming off insensitive. Uh... I think that what erik's doing is beautiful. -But the nsb-- -never stop believing. They don't have any big partnerships. And without big sponsors from big companies, uh, I just don't understand how a small non-profit like his could pull off such a large-scale event on christmas day, it's seemingly impossible. And yet it always happens. It's a wonder! People deserve the truth. I think you'll find the answers you're looking for just by letting the spirit of the season guide you. I don't understand what that means. -But you will. -[chuckles] [sighs] it was the strangest meeting. I could not get a straight answer from him. Have you actually just straight up asked erik about where the money comes from? Not yet, I'm trying to gain his trust first so that he will be honest with me, but it is so hard to get anything out of him. -Oh. Classic distraction tactic. -Exactly. He would rather listen than talk. And he would rather watch from behind the scenes than get attention from an entire community of people who adore him. -He sounds kind of amazing. -[scoffs] it's a little weird if you ask me. Why did you make hot chocolate, by the way? -You never drink it. -I had a craving. Sue me. -A christmas craving? -Tish, focus. -I don't know what to do! -Okay. Maybe you ask him out to dinner or something to get to know him on a more personal level. Tsk. I don't know. I just think you'll have better luck getting his full attention if there isn't an entire city-wide event he is responsible for distracting him. That is a good point. -I'm not just a pretty face. -[laughs] speaking of which, I made an appointment at the vital records office at new york state to see what I can find out about his birth parents. Will they let you look through private records without going through the new york state court? I have a good rapport with them down there. If I play my cards right, they'll let me scan a few documents. Well, that's why you're the best researcher in new york. -Oh! Cheers to that. -Hey. [charity on recorder] how did you two first meet? -[laptop keys clacking] -[static] [scoffs] you've got to be kidding. Ing] erik. Hey, what are you up to? Uh, hey, I'm just going over the schedule for the next nine days. There's still tons to look forward to. Great. Uh, oh, what's today's event again? Christmas ornament-making for the big tree-lighting ceremony on the 22nd. Nice. That should be fun. Your enthusiasm is almost too much to bear. I've been meaning to tell you the same thing. [laughing] yeah, you wouldn't be the first one. Uh, so, listen. I actually, I wanted to ask you a question. -I'm all ears. -Well... I was wondering if you would like to meet me tonight for dinner so that we're not surrounded by so much distraction when I'm gathering my research. -Yeah, that sounds great. -Really? Great. Okay. Um, uh, any favorite restaurants? I know the perfect spot. I'll bring a basket. -Basket? -Does 7 p.M. Sound good? Sure. Uh, and so where should I meet you? I'll pin drop you the location. Don't forget to bundle up. Bye. [instrumental music] [fire crackling] -you found it. -So we're having a picnic. -In the dead of winter. -Yeah. You've never heard of a winter picnic before? -[laughs] never. -You've been missing out. Being surrounded by snow, the trees, great company, there's nothing better. Here. Let's grab a seat. Well, you are full of surprises. More fun than a restaurant, right? Depends on the food. [laughs] for our main course, we got macaroni and cheese with bacon bits. Oh. I do love mac and cheese. For dessert, chocolate truffles made by yours truly, and, of course, some hot cocoa to keep us warm. Wow. I can't believe you did all this. Hey, why not? Christmas is about making special memories. Well, the ornament-making today was fun. The kids seemed to love it. Did you just say that you had fun today? Uh, did anybody else hear that? No, it's just us. Just because I'm not santa's number-one helper doesn't mean I'm a total scrooge, you know? Yeah, you're right, although I see you as more of a, uh, grinch character than a scrooge, personally. That's rude. [laughs] I'm just joking, I'm just joking. Yeah, you were, you were great with the kids today. I like having you around. -You do? -Yeah, I wouldn't lie to you. Okay, well, um, firstly-- oh, no, no, no, no, no. Not so fast. Let's eat first. ♪ I can feel the magic in the air ♪ ♪ christmas everywhere ♪ ♪ I just need someone to hold ♪ ♪ nothing like your favorite time of year ♪ ♪ to fill you up with cheer ♪ ♪ come snuggle up in the cold ♪ ♪ I don't need presents I don't need snow ♪ ♪ I just you need you babe ♪ ♪ and a little mistletoe 'cause ♪ ♪ the only thing that's on my wish list ♪ ♪ is getting close to you on christmas ♪ ♪ 'cause all I need is just some kissin'... ♪ [erik] you're right, george c. Scott is the better scrooge, although michael caine is a close second in the muppet christmas carol. Finally we agree on something. There's such truth and depth to george's portrayal, you know? M-michael caine was acting with muppets... -Okay. -Right? [sighs] okay, we really need to get down to business now 'cause if I hand in a report on the top five scrooges of all time, I am totally fired. Okay, okay, fine. Have at it. What's on your mind? First of all, what is with the dust-in-the-chimney thing? What happened to just sending santa an old-fashioned letter in the mail? That works, too, but throwing your wish into a fire just gets your wish to santa that much quicker than snail mail, so... -If you say so. -It's true. What else? Um, well, I was hoping that I could ask you a few questions regarding never stop believing. Let me guess. How do I get the money to do it all? Right, so I fund-raise all year to pull off the 12 days of christmas event. And I have private donors that believe in me and in what I do, and that's how it keeps on going. Well, then what about christmas day? 'cause I read that last year you gave out more than two million dollars' worth of gifts to people. That's all kris. What do you mean? Who's kris? Kris gets the gifts to new york and then I distribute them. Okay, so then how does kris have all this money? -Is he some kind of billionaire? -No. When people believe in what christmas is really about, magic happens. So you're telling me that two million dollars' worth of gifts arrive via christmas magic? -That's so hard to believe? -Yes. It is. It-it makes no sense. Well, sometimes things don't make sense. That's what makes life so interesting. And what's this kris guy's last name? Because I can get my researcher tisha to look into it. Kringle. Although I doubt she'd find anything on him 'cause he's not really on social media. Kris kringle? Really? Charity, I know that you probably think that what I believe in is outrageous, but trust me, it's not some cover for like a, an underground secret operation. When I was 14, kris asked me to be one of his helpers, and I said yes. So you seriously can look me in the eye and sincerely tell me that santa claus is the one behind all of the gifts on christmas day? How else would thousands of people get what they wished for? That's what I'm trying to figure out! You'll figure it out. Speaking of which... Have you written down your christmas wish yet? I thought it only came true if you really believe. You think I'm crazy. I think that this whole thing is crazy! [laughs] but I am a little jealous that you never lost that part of you that usually disappears when we hit adulthood. You know, that part that still believes that anything is possible. I miss that feeling, and you're lucky you still have it. -Did you ever believe in santa? -When I was a kid. You know, I wrote him a letter one year asking for a rachel the reporter doll. And my mom thought it would be cute if we kissed the letter for good luck. So she kissed the letter and then she let me put lipstick on and I kissed the letter, and it's silly, but... I really cherish that memory. I've never even met my parents and it still hurts that... They left me. Well, they're missing out on someone really special. If you could leave that part of my story out of your article, I'd really appreciate it. You can trust me. [traffic bustling] [door opens] [chuckles] [instrumental music] last night was so fun! Sounds like a scene out of a nicholas sparks novel. How do you know who nicholas sparks is? I'm hip, I've seen the notebook more than once. The fact that he believes that christmas magic is real and santa's the one responsible for all those gifts, it's, it's got me really thrown off. [martin] you know, I'd like to meet this fellow. He seems like one of a kind. Oh, he is. He sure is. Hey. If it isn't my favorite new reporter. Janet, hi. Uh, well, this is my dad, martin. And, dad, this is my boss, janet. It's nice to finally meet you, janet. Well, your daughter is doing some excellent investigating these days. And I can't wait to see what she finds out. It's going to be the talk of the town, I can just feel it. -That's wonderful. -I better get in line. Uh, what is the event you're doing today? Oh, um, erik bought a bunch of christmas trees from vendors around the city and he is setting up a christmas tree market in the park. And every family gets to pick out one for free. Fantastic. You just make sure you get to the bottom of this ridiculousness. Bye! Nice meeting you. ♪ silent night ♪ ♪ holy night ♪ ♪ all is calm ♪ [erik] all right, enjoy. -Charity! -Hi. Hi! -What do you think? -This is so great! -Yeah. -[chuckles] right, we got, we got popcorn, cider, pretzels, everything. Wow, do you need my help, uh, helping anyone pick out a tree or anything? Oh, no, no, I want you to see this. Hey, you guys found the treats, all right. Uh, charity, I want you to meet jonah and his dad, sergeant robert sanderson. -Oh. Nice to meet you both. Hi. -Hello. -Hi. -Hi. So you guys are probably wondering why I asked you to come down here today. -Right? -Yes, sir. Couple of days ago I got a special message from santa and he told me that because he got jonah's christmas wish early, he thought that it was only fair to give him his present early. -Really? -Wait, what... What christmas wish? I wished to be able to see mom! His mom's in the army. -She's a marine, actually. -Right. Marine. Now, jonah, you know that your mom can't communicate with us until she's done her training. Believe it or not, santa really does deliver. -[vivian on video] my boys! -Mom! Oh, my gosh, vivian, hi. [robert] it is so good to see you. [vivian] I have missed you both so much, it hurts. H-h-how are you? Are you, are you... Are you both prepared for christmas? Mom, I sent santa a christmas wish that I could see you, and he made it come true! [vivian] well, you know what's funny, jonah? Listen, I sent him one, too, except my wish was that I could spend christmas with both of you. You did? Maybe it will come true, too! Don't get your hopes up, okay, jonah? [robert] santa can't make every christmas miracle happen. Are you sure about that? Where'd she go? Mom? Surprise! -[sobbing] -oh! Oh... [vivian] I can't believe I'm actually holding you. -Oh, oh, honey! -I can't believe you're here! -[robert laughing] -I missed you. [robert] thank god. Oh. [vivian] jonah, you've gotten so big! [robert] it is so great to see you. [robert laughs] -mom. -Robert, I love you so much. [jonah] I can't believe you're here. [erik] thank you for your service. [chuckles] well, thank you for everything. I am truly, truly overwhelmed. I only set up the video chat, the rest is thanks to... -Well, you know. -[chuckles] -merry christmas. -Merry christmas. Sergeant, merry christmas. -Thank you. Really. -[erik laughs] jonah, show me the tree you picked out. All right, yeah. Oh, that's... So I was told to give you... This. -What? Me? -Uh-huh. From who? From you know who. [laughs] what's... "it's about time you got this back." [laughs] what? A rachel the reporter doll. I didn't think they still made these! Merry christmas. How'd you pull that off? Christmas magic in full effect. [chuckles] oh, the look on their faces. -I thought you'd like that. -[chuckles] what you do for people, I don't understand it, but it's incredible. Oh, hey, I can't take all the credit. -[chuckles] -but you know that already. Okay, well, then how did you pull this off? Because it looks exactly like the one I had as a kid, right down to the little camera accessory. [laughs] that, that wasn't me. Hey, erik, come on, you're the only one that I told. And I haven't been able to find one of these anywhere. Kris does not reveal his sources. Okay. I'm-I'm so confused. If I don't start getting concrete, sensible answers soon, janet's never gonna assign me on anything ever again. Charity... Is, is that all this is to you? Just you trying to get ahead in your career? No, of course not, what matters to me is reporting on things that matter, in a honest way. And what you do, it matters. I just don't understand it. Well, I think you do, deep down. -Charity! -Hey. -Ah! -What are you doing here? Free christmas trees? Come on, I'd be a fool not to show up. Uh, well, tisha, this is erik. Hey, best researcher in the state. -Heard a lot about you. -Vice versa. And I hope that you haven't found anything too incriminating on me. No. Your criminal record is clean as a whistle. Phew! Hey, the more the merrier! -Hey! -[aaron] hey! You guys, this is my friend, tish. Hi, I'm caitlin. This is my dad. Aaron. Nice to meet you. You, too. Uh, you must be excited about christmas, huh? Yes. It's my favorite day! Wanna help me pick out a tree? -Sure, I'd love to. -Uh, y-you don't have to. Caitlin, honey, tish probably wants to pick out her own tree. How about I help you pick out yours? -You help me pick out mine? -Deal! Daddy, coming? Yeah, I'll be there in a second. [chuckles] oh, that lady definitely needs some help with her tree. -Mm-hmm. Yeah. -I'll be right back. You're not going anywhere, are you? I'll be right here. [chuckles] I gotta tell you, charity... I think I may have misjudged you. You have had a real impact on erik. Well, honestly, he's changed my outlook on so many things over the last eight days, it's crazy. He's a special guy. I feel lucky to know him. -He's single, too, you know? -Oh, okay. Uh, well, I am strictly a reporter to him until christmas day. Ah, okay. Playing hard to get, huh? You sound exactly like tish. Tish, yeah. She seems nice. She is the best catch out there as far as I'm concerned. She is smart and funny and beautiful and very single. Thank you. I will keep that in mind. Yeah. Dad, we found the perfect ee I have to admit it's pretty beautiful. Oh, that's great! Can we decorate it tonight with tisha and charity and uncle erik? That sounds like a really great idea. Yeah, I love it. Our place is a bit of a mess right now, caitlin. We're in mid-renovations. Well, why don't you guys come to our place? You can help tish and I decorate our tree. Are you sure? -We'd love to have you. -Yes! [instrumental "we wish you a merry christmas"] oh. I like this one, it's pretty. -I like the glitter. -Thank you. I made that when I was around your age. Caitlin, wanna hear something cool? When snowflakes fall from the clouds, they tumble through the air, swirling and spiraling, and they each become a different shape. That's what makes every snowflake completely unique. Is that why they taste so good, too? [chuckles] that is why they taste so good. I think that people, you know, we're the same as snowflakes 'cause we each have our different journeys to get where we're supposed to be, and that's what makes us special in our own way. -I like that. -Yeah. Magic is always surrounding us. Sometimes we just need to remember to look for it. Who wants more hot chocolate? -Me, me, me! -Yeah, I'll have some, too. -Erik? Charity? -Uh... I think I'm gonna head out for some fresh air. -Yeah. I'll join you. -Okay. So I liked what you said up there about snowflakes. -Yeah, right? -[chuckles] the way you see the world, it's the right way. How is your article coming along? It's coming along. I feel pretty inspired actually. -Today was amazing. -It was. [chuckles] I can't believe there's only four events left. Uh, five, including christmas day. Yeah, right. So have you written down your christmas wish yet? -Not yet... -Not quite convinced, huh? [laughs] baby steps, remember? -Mm-hmm. -Can I ask you something? Anything. Why doesn't kris just deliver the gifts himself on christmas day if he so badly wants people to believe in him? Well, it's not just about believing in him. It's about believing in the magic of the season. Oh, is this the part when you tell me the true meaning of christmas? [laughs] that's easy. Love. Love is the greatest gift that any one of us can receive and it can't be seen. But that doesn't make it any less real. Yeah, I guess not. We don't need to see something to believe it. Because feeling it is enough. I'm sorry. Uh, um... Um, it, I, it's unprofessional. No, no, no, no, I'm, I'm, I'm sorry. I, I let the moment, uh, get away from me. No, you know, it's just, this is my first real job as a reporter, and I don't wanna do anything to mess it up. -Yeah, I understand. -Okay. Totally. So would it be completely unprofessional if I ask you to be my plus one to the mayor's christmas eve gala? -Really? -Yeah. -You got tickets to that? -Yeah. The mayor likes the work that I do for the city. -So what do you say? -Ooh! You know, I'm not really a party person, but I think I can make an exception just this once. -[chuckles] -a true act of compassion. [laptop keys clacking] I really think it could be one of the best things I've ever written. -Really? -Mm-hmm. Obviously, I still need more information, but I really think erik's gonna really like it. Erik, huh? Here I thought you were writing this to impress janet. Well, her too, of course. [sighs] I sent her the rough draft last night. Hey, how come you haven't been posting anything to your blog lately? I miss reading it. It's just been too busy, now that I've got a real assignment, it's hard to keep up with. But people adore your blog. [sighs] well, I'll get back to it. Maybe I'll write a post ranking the top five on-screen scrooges of all time, 'cause it's quite the controversial topic. [laughing] I like this new festive charity. What's next, are you gonna go caroling door to door? Okay, let's not get carried away. I can't believe erik invited you to the mayor's super elite christmas eve gala. Okay, come on. It's just a party. You better take so many pictures that I am nauseated by the time I'm done looking at them. Deal. So what did you think of aaron? What? Well, I hadn't given it much thought. -He seems like a nice guy. -Mm-hmm. Okay. I won't ask any more questions. I'm just trying to help the christmas season work its magic. Thanks, girl. All right, so what is on the agenda for today? My appointment is at the records office today. I'm gonna see if I can find out more about erik's past. Oh, you know, my article is taking a different direction, so I don't know if that's necessary anymore. Well, I already told janet I was going, and she seemed really pleased, so I should still go. -All right. Fair enough. -Oh, speaking of which... Janet was looking for you this morning. Oh, really? Okay, yeah. She probably wants to talk about my rough draft. -[tisha] hm, good luck. -Thank you. I just finished reading your draft, and I have to say, I'm speechless. Really? Well... It is a different approach, but I thought you might like it. I'm speechless because I thought you were someone that could follow directions. I'm sorry? Did I not make myself clear? This article is about finding out how the christmas day giveaway is funded. And you were instructed to crack the nsb wide open. I realize that, but there is nothing to crack. Everything they do is to help as many people as possible get back to the roots of what christmas is all about. Millions of dollars' worth of gifts are given out on christmas day, and there's no paperwork that says where the money's coming from. That's the story. I know, and I know it sounds crazy, but there is something bigger going on here. No one is behind the gifts. They're delivered miraculously. It doesn't sound crazy, it is crazy! Janet, I was, I was just as skeptical as you when I started this article, but I've seen things and felt things that go way beyond what money could buy. Let me ask you something, charity. -Do you want to be a reporter? -More than anything. Then I suggest you get some cold, hard facts and find out what's really going on. You want me to rewrite my entire article? But there's only three days left until christmas eve. Then you better get working. [erik] hey, you. [charity] hey. -Everything okay? -Oh, yeah, it's just work stuff. My boss is unhappy with me. You wanna talk about it? You know, I could use some advice, actually. Shoot. How do you stay true to your instinct and beliefs even when people doubt you and make you feel small? Well, it's, it's not easy. Hotdog with ketchup. There's a lot of judgment out there, and people fear what they don't understand. So for me, I like to get to know someone, make them feel valued and listened to so that they can learn to do the same for me. -It's all about connection. -And that works? -You tell me. -[chuckles] whatever you do, never sacrifice who you are or what you believe in order to make someone else happy. It will not be worth it. You're right. Yeah, I should just stick to my guns, even if it does make her angry. Um, next time you sit down with your boss, why don't you give her one of these? Sounds like she could use some christmas spirit. Erik? Erik gallagher. Before my very eyes. -Mayor flynn. You made it. -So good to see you. Oh, my daughters are so excited for the christmas scavenger hunt through the park this afternoon. Once again you've outdone yourself. Oh. I appreciate it, but you know I can't take full credit. Well, the city is buzzing with how much fun they're having at these events. It's spreading through social media, and tourists are already planning their trips here for next year. Oh, that's fantastic. Uh, I'm just happy to, well, make it happen. And who do we have here? Uh, I'm charity jones. A reporter for the journal. I see, you guys have been digging to scandalize me for years. Charity's, um, she's writing an article about the nsb. [chuckles] yeah, it's a feature on erik and all of the work that he does. It's about time he opens himself up to the press. Just be careful. Sometimes they aren't always so nice. Well, I'm gonna show you I'm not one of those reporters. Yeah, I'm really looking forward to reading your article. -Comes out christmas eve. -Oh, that reminds me. Have you found a plus one to bring to the party yet? -Oh. You're looking at her. -Oh. Lovely. I look forward to seeing you both. Us, too. Merry christmas. -Nice meeting you, mayor flynn. -Nice meeting you. So the journal's looking for dirt on the mayor? She's an amazing person. From everything I've researched, she sure seems like she is. But according to my boss, everyone's got a secret that's waiting to be exposed. Do you think that's true? I used to. -[cell phone rings] -sorry. Uh, it's tish, I should probably get this. Okay, tell her I say hi. I should go help set up the clues. -Yeah. Okay. -[erik] see you later. -Hello? -Charity, it's me. -I found something. -Wait. What are you talking about? Found what? About erik. I found out who his birth parents are. [tisha on phone] girl, they are millionaires. [dramatic music] [tisha] have a look. [sighs] I don't understand. How did you do it? I found the documents that had been redacted, but the high school they went to wasn't. Someone probably forgot to black it out. All I did was go to the high school, talked to a few people, looked at a few yearbooks and figured it out. I can't believe it. Turns out she got pregnant when they were both 16 and gave erik up for adoption. About ten years ago they came up with this genius idea for an app and struck gold. I looked them up, and they seem very eccentric. Eccentric enough to give two million dollars' worth of gifts away each year? Do you think erik knows about them and has been lying this whole time? No, there's no way that he could have known. In fact, this will really hurt him and completely crush everything that he believes in. Why would his parents do this? It doesn't make any sense. I don't know. Maybe to give him the childhood he never had? Or maybe to feel connected to him in some way. What are you gonna do? I don't have the heart to tell him. What about the article? Janet will want this to be included. -It explains everything. -I know. I know. It's the missing piece to the whole story. But I told erik that I wouldn't include anything about his parents in the article. And a good reporter doesn't break trust with their subject. And, plus, this isn't some scandal that needs to be exposed. The christmas day giveaway brings together so many people and fills them with hope. Why would I wanna ruin that? [sighs] do you think I'm making a huge mistake? -By not telling the whole story? -Of course not. You're choosing integrity over a headline. [sighs] if janet ever found out that I had this huge piece of information and chose to withhold it, I could get in so much trouble. You wouldn't be a real reporter if you didn't take some risks for the betterment of others. -Are you okay? -Yeah. It's silly, really. I started to believe. And it felt really good to lean in to the unexplainable. I know. I'm so sorry, charity. Me, too. [laptop keys clacking] so my flight lands around 8:00, but, apparently, there might be a storm. So, hopefully, I don't get delayed. Hello? Earth to charity? What? Yeah. Yeah, sure. What's up with you today? You don't seem yourself. Uh, I'm just tired, I was up all night trying to re-write my story. And you're not happy with it? [sighs] well, I made some changes, but I decided to basically keep it the same. So I'm staying true to myself. I'm doing what I believe is right. And... I just sent it. What will janet think? Uh, well, she, she's going to be disappointed that I didn't uncover anything groundbreaking, but she has to accept it, otherwise the paper will have an empty front page. Well, I'm still very excited to read it. -I'm sure it's great. -Thank you, dad. I can't believe it's already the 23rd. Are you excited to go to the mayor's christmas eve gala tomorrow? I heard that sarah jessica parker might be there. I'm not even gonna ask you how you know who she is. I told you. I'm hip, man! Oh, yeah, I guess I'm excited, but I'm more so just looking forward to spending time with erik even if he has got it all wrong. -What do you mean? -Oh, nothing. Well, I guess I should head in to work. I'll see you tomorrow. You betcha, and I'll bring the champagne to help celebrate your first official article. Thank you, dad. I can't wait to see you. [martin] you, too, kiddo. [call disconnects] [instrumental music] hey. Tish, what's wrong? I'm sorry. I don't know how she found out. What are you talking about? Charity, my office, now. [sighs] close the door. Where are the changes I asked for? [sighs] I'm sorry, janet. I, I just couldn't do it. It wouldn't be right. Do you think most journalists out there get their big stories by doing what's right? Give me a break. Well, what good'll it do to print the real way that the gifts are acquired? It'll hurt a lot of wonderful, kindhearted people, not to mention, make the whole thing seem fraudulent. Fraudulent. That's the point. But we don't even know for sure if his parents are behind it all, it's all speculation. Sometimes speculation is enough. Our readers love a scandal. Well, maybe I shouldn't be writing for them. Excuse me? I wanna write about things that inform, excite and inspire new yorkers, not gossip. And if writing with integrity makes me a bad journalist, then maybe working at the times square journal isn't the job for me. What? Wait, are you quitting? Because of one article about some guy who's clearly delusional? Well, I'd rather spend my time reporting truthfully on somebody like him who believes in goodness and kindness, than spend my time working for somebody who only cares about what will sell. Fine. When you were little... Didn't you ever believe in the magic of christmas? Look, erik's birth parents may be the ones who buy all the gifts, but that doesn't take away from the fact that the last 11 days have changed me for the better. There was magic at each of those events whether you wanna believe me or not. Erik wanted you to have this. Merry christmas, janet. [sighs] [laptop keys clacking] [cell phone ringing] -hello? -Hi. You on your way? Yeah, sorry, you know, I don't think I'm gonna be able to make it in today 'cause I'm not really feeling so great. I'm-I'm sorry to hear that. Oh. When does the times square journal come out tomorrow? 'cause I cannot wait to read your words in print. Uh, it should be early morning around 9:00. Charity, this, this is a huge deal. Your first article as a reporter, wow. -Uh, listen, I should get goin'. -Oh, you'll be missed. -And I'll see you tomorrow? -See you tomorrow. [instrumental music] oh, tom, this weather is insane. Charity, you shouldn't be out in this. -They're calling for a blizzard. -A blizzard? Are you serious? It's only supposed to get worse. Hey, where's today's copy of the times square journal? They had a delivery delay. Probably on account of the weather. I'd tell you to come back and check in a few hours, but I'm gonna close up early today. Yeah. Well, it's probably online anyway. -Well, merry christmas! -You, too, charity. -[door opens] -[tisha exhales sharply] what are you doing home? It's not even noon. -I quit, too. -What? No! No, you did not have to do that for me. Listen... It's not just about you. You were right. Working for a company that doesn't value compassion isn't worth it. I'll find a research job somewhere else. That's why you're my best friend. Plus, I couldn't miss helping you get ready for tonight! -Oh! -How excited are you? I'm excited. But? But I don't know. I just... I feel weird not being totally honest with erik about what I know. -You're protecting him. -Yeah, I guess. Have you picked up a copy of your article? I just tried to look it up online, but there's nothing there yet. I tried to get one from tom, and it's not on the stands either. -So you think janet pulled it? -She wouldn't. -Have you met janet? -Good point. Well, anyway, maybe it's for the best. I'm just excited to spend time tonight with erik without any agenda. You really like him, huh? [laughs] yeah. Yeah, I guess I do. [squealing] -you're in love! -Oh, you're insane! I don't remember the last time you felt this way. Well, 'cause I don't know that I've ever felt this way. I'm so happy for you. Okay, we don't even know if he feels the same way. Don't kid yourself. I see the way he looks at you. -With those heart eyes... -[laughs] [sighs] well, I guess we'll find out tonight. -Let's get you ready. -[chuckles] [instrumental music] you look... Wow. -Uh... -You, too. I was looking for your article this morning. -I, I couldn't find it. -Yeah. I don't know if it's ever gonna come out. I'm pretty sure it was pulled. Really? Was I that boring? No... Uh, is it cool if we don't talk about the article tonight? 'cause I'd rather just be present. Here. -[instrumental music] -with you. -Wanna dance with me? -[chuckles] yes, I would. ♪ I don't need no presents ♪ ♪ round my tree ♪ ♪ on the mis... ♪ and, uh, I, um... I was thinking about you a lot today. Yeah? What about? Um, well, I was thinking that since you're done reporting on me, you're no longer obligated to spend time with me. That is true. -I'm finally free. -[laughs] and, um... It made me sad. Um, the idea of not seeing you every day. I know what you mean. -Yeah? -Yeah. Good. Good, 'cause at some point today I'm gonna ask you out on a real date, and I thought you should know. Okay. Well, that is very generous of you. Um, now I've got some time to think of a gentle way to let you know I'm busy that day. Well, you can't be busy all the days. [chuckles] why don't you just ask me out now, and get it over with? Charity jones, will you do me the great honor of going out on a date with me... Uh, this Friday? I'm busy. [laughs] I would love... I would love nothing more. I'm really happy that I met you. I, uh, I hope this isn't too forward, but I feel like I'm really starting to-- -okay, um, uh, wait. -Fall-- um, before you say anything else, I think there's something that I should probably tell you. Okay. What is it? Well, it has something to do with what I found out while I was working out on the article. Uh, I thought you didn't wanna talk about the article tonight. Um... -[cell phone vibrating] -oh. Hold on a s-s-second. -It's, uh, it's aaron. -Oh. He says he needs to talk to me about something that's urgent. Oh. Uh, is everything all right? I don't know, but I, I should call him. Um, give me a sec. [flynn] erik? -So glad to see you! -Hi. Oh. Mm. Don't you look handsome? Thank you, mayor flynn. -Um, you remember charity? -Uh, hi again. I'm quite surprised to see you here. Oh, I... I mentioned to you the other day, uh, she's my plus one. You haven't read the article? I'm sorry? Trying to turn something that is so special for our city into a potential fraud investigation? -What? -[sighs] -what? -Wait... Erik, I have no idea what she's talking about. "erik gallagher, founder of nsb, full of the christmas spirit or just full of it? By charity jones." wait. I didn't write that. You think my birth parents are funding all of the gifts to get a tax break? [scoffs] wait, hold on. My boss must have rewritten my article out of spite. You didn't answer my question. I'm sorry. -I wanted to tell you. -I can't believe this. You promised that you wouldn't make my parents a part of the article. I didn't! In fact, I quit because of it all! So when did you know who they were? Just a few days ago. And like I said, I wanted to tell you, but-- and so after you promised that you wouldn't include them, you were still trying to find them? Wait, no. That was tish-- I don't, I don't know who my parents are, but they have nothing to do with the christmas day giveaway. Charity, I, I trusted you. -How could you do this? -I know. I'm sorry. Me and you, all of this was, was just so you could get ahead in your career? No! No, you've got it all wrong. Erik, you know me, you know that I would never do anything to hurt you. I think you should leave. Erik, you have to believe me. Like you believed me? You know what, I, I think I'm gonna leave. I, uh, I need to prepare for tomorrow's giveaway if anybody even shows up, so... Merry christmas, charity. Erik, please! Please...

You have no idea how happy I am to see you. Hey. Hey. There, there. Everything's gonna be all right. I'm so sorry, honey. Janet should have never have done that to you. I knew as soon as I read the article that you would never write that kind of fluff. Well, he thinks I'm a horrible person. You should have seen the look on his face. He was heartbroken. A person can only experience heartbreak if they're truly in love. And if he cares about you the way I think he does, he'll come to his senses. I don't know. He wants to be with someone who believes. And you don't? Not everything has to be about facts and what adds up. You know what, let's go for a walk. The fresh air will do us good. Don't sweat the small stuff. [mumbles] everything's gonna be all right. It's christmas eve, magic in the air. Yes, I'm... Aware. -Oh. I'm so sorry. -I-it's quite all right. Frank murray? Is that you? Marty! Wow! It's been too long! -Uh, this is my wife, diane. -Hi, diane. How have you been, frank? Oh, and how's the shop? -I need to get over there soon. -It's fantastic. The christmas truffles sold out early today, so I certainly can't complain. Did you say christmas truffles? Charity, this is frank, owner of frank's chocolate shop in the west village. We went to nyu together. -Charity jones? The reporter? -Hey, you're frank? I waited for an hour at the diner. -On 34th. -Broadway. Uh, I'm so sorry for the mix-up. Yeah, me, too. But if I didn't talk to you, then... -Oh, my... -Charity, are you okay? It was, it was so nice to meet you both. Uh, dad, something just came up. I'll meet you back at the apartment, okay? [door opens] -[laptop keys clacking] -[instrumental music] [sighs] [charity] it all started on an early December morning at a newsstand. Little did I know that erik gallagher or as he's more well known, erik christmas, was about to change my life forever. Because of him, I learned that kindness and love have the power to give people hope, and make the seemingly impossible possible. Now I know in my heart that santa is real. All you have to do is believe. I mean, really believe. And the spirit of christmas will do the rest. [cell phone vibrating] [instrumental music] ten o'clock? [scribbling] good morning, sunshine. -Merry christmas. -Oh. What were you doing up so late last night, huh? Dad, will you come with me to the park? I think I've got to make things right before it's too late. I thought you would never ask. [upbeat music] [indistinct chatter] whoa! A real scooter! [sighs] okay. I think I should go find erik. Yes. Go to him, honey. I love you. -[charity chuckles] -I love you, too, kiddo. -Now go! -[chuckles] [erik] hey. Hey. -I read your blog. -Really? You're a great writer, charity. Erik, I'm sorry that I doubted you and it took me so long to understand, but I get it now. -I believe. -It's okay. Charity, what, what you wrote... Did you mean it that you were falling in love? No, I... I am falling in love with you. Good... Because I'm falling in love with you, too. [laughs] christmas delivery! Oh? From who? Santa, of course. [laughs] it's the letter. Merry christmas, charity. [cell phone ringing] [erik] go ahead. Uh, hello? [mike on phone] hi, I'd like to speak to charity jones, please. This is her. Hi, this is mike hollis calling from the times. I'm sorry to bother you on christmas day. Oh, no, uh, that's all right. How can I help you? I've been seeing your blog post is getting a lot of attention today. I read it. I think it's a wonderful piece. -Thank you. -[mike] so listen. I won't take up too much of your time, but I wanted to get to you before anyone else did. There's an opening here at the times, in the new york region section. We're looking for a new reporter and I think you might be the one to fill that space. Me? The times? Would it be all right if I gave you a call in the new year to schedule a meeting? Yes! Yes! A million times yes! Good. Merry christmas. Merry christmas. [laughing] what could possibly make this christmas any better? I can think of something. [song playing] [man] ho, ho, ho! [man] merry christmas!
