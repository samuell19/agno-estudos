On a bench beneath a tree And garbage bags He has a home, he has a kingdom He lives in a shopping cart Full of secrets Like a flashing sign of lost hopes They said he was the king of a distant land They said his wife ran away They said he was rich... Can I take a look? Can you take another one, please? That's it. Thank you. Thank you. Sara'le? Sara'le? Watch out for the shards. Sorry, I was tired. It's all right, I was late. I can sweep it up. - No, of course not. It's all right. I only worked for two and a half hours. - Don't worry about it. Thanks. Good night. - Good night. Daddy! Let's wash your face. Daddy, give me a piggyback. Come here. Hello? Two nights including breakfast. Rabbinical kosher, of course. And the meat is ultra kosher. Kosher food supervisor is there all the time. When you're done, do the disposable utensils. I can take 100 shekels off my fee. Listen, I'm already taking 50 shekels off my fee. I can't touch their percentage. Believe me, I can't! I gave you 100 shekels off my fee. That leaves me with 150. Daddy! - Don't run. Daddy. - Thanks, Sara'le. Bye, Geula. I can take off another 20. Ask your wife and get back to me, okay? Honey, how are you? How was kindergarten? - Fine. Can I put on a sticker? - One. Go ahead. Did you say your prayer, sweetie? Can I say it with Sara'le? - Yes. He has a boat to give away Anchored and lost He has an anchor stuck in the ground He's not sailing anywhere, certainly not to you In the storm you await him on the island And you're not the only one He has an anchor in the ground you should know that There's no signal and there's nobody following you He has a boat to give away Anchored and lost He has an anchor stuck in the ground He's not sailing anywhere, certainly not to you Jesus! This is Menny. - Hi, Menny. -Menny... Adi. -Nice to meet you. - And you? Avi. How's it going, Menny? - Thank God. 15 years ago... - Yes? You would've gone for him. I don't think so. You'd be surprised. He once stole a girl from me. Not nice. More like she stole me. But she wasn't all over me. She waited for me after the show, she brought me dessert. Wow, dessert. Nice. So, Cookie, you mind going somewhere else? Yes. - Thanks. -Wait... What? I need a minute with him. Mind waiting upstairs? I dunno. Maybe. - Maybe? You screwed me again. Okay. I'll do it. Thanks, Avi. I appreciate it. Bless you. Thanks. It's the same picture. I don't know which one's my dad because they're all without shirts. Yeah, you can't tell. This is my dad. Isn't he handsome? Even if he isn't religious here. Time for bed, Geula. He's the leader, that's why he gets the biggest picture. And he wrote all the lyrics. Let's go to sleep. C'mon. It's late. It's late. I'll be right there. Okay? High Beams Menny? Menny, is that you? How's it going, Dana? - Wow! - I can't believe it...! - Didn't Goolie say I was coming? -No. We said 11:00. - Wow! Come on in. He's asleep, I'll wake him up. If I'd known, I'd have koshered the kitchen, bought a cake, lit candles, something. I won't touch you. Got a little paunchy there. A little. Don't just stand there like some rabbi. So how's it going? Thank God. Thank God good or thank God bad? Wow... Is he still asleep? He's not working at the kiosk today so why get up? To help me with the kids, maybe? No, he didn't help all morning! Shall we wake him? - Yeah. Let's go. C'mon! It's stifling in here! Ok, it'll take him a minute. I'll make you some coffee. No, thanks. Don't bother. - Relax, I know your kind, plastic cup, plastic spoon, everything is plastic except God. We said 11:00. Tell him the teacher asked us to come and get the kid, he has diarrhea. Good morning, Dana. You hear me? Yaniv has diarrhea. - I heard. What did you feed him? Quinoa? No, I starved him. Now get your ass moving. Coffee's coming up. - I'll have some too. Make it yourself. Hey, man. Sit down. How's it going? Thank God. So? Is Avi in? Yeah. Nice... So what happened? You got money troubles? Sorry, I had to take that. So Avi said yes? Yeah. He needs the money. And Goolie said yes, though he's doing okay, thank God. - "Thank God..." Sorry, no Inari today. Can I get you something else? What do you recommend? I'd say the salmon sashimi. It's excellent today. Sorry. Menachem, this is Naomi. -Hey. - This is Menachem. Fantastic singer. Naomi owns the restaurant with me, fifty-fifty. We met here. You realized she's my girlfriend? I don't just kiss every girl... So what do you think? Not a chance, Menachem. I work online, these are my work hours. I'm on Canada time... - Weddings usually end at midnight. What about me and Naomi? Don't we deserve a little time together? You want to take that away from us? Goolie and Avi are coming to my place next week. Why don't you come? Thanks, Mika. Table 8 dropped a fork... Call it a class reunion. Excuse me. Class reunion, huh? When is it? Next week, we didn't set a day. We were waiting for you. -Ok. Next week is quite tight... The 17th? 9 p.m.? It's the 29th of the Hebrew month. - So? It's my daughter Geula's birthday. - Congrats. Then the week after. - No, no. She's in bed by nine. You run a tight ship. I like that. Okay. Then it's a date. Next week, the 29th. Well? Speak up. How's it going? What's new? Any new songs? How about something from the Torah? There's a Hassidic parable about salmon. They say that salmon is like the soul. It swims in the sea all its life, right? And when it feels it's about to die it goes back to the place where it was born, to lay eggs, to reproduce. That's its purpose in life. It leaps over 20-foot waterfalls, grizzly bears... swims against the current, nothing stops it. Same thing with the soul. It wants to go back to its source, to the Creator. The soul goes through this journey every day, because we don't know when life is about to end. Every minute is like the salmon. Every minute, huh? Nice. But for real now, the salmon... did it taste good? Did you have a fun birthday? - Yeah, but only three friends came. Really? Why? I don't know. One girl gave me this present. - Wow. Very pretty. Because her daddy also became religious, like my daddy. - I see. What else did you get? My second friend gave me bubble gum. And the third friend? Say goodnight, sweetie. - But I want to be with your friends. I know, but it's late. Get to bed. - Just one story? Another time. It's late. - Please! Just one. We're in no hurry, Menny. Go read her a story. All right, get in bed. I'll be right there. Good night. These are the classics. I downloaded the most popular numbers. We know most of the tunes. The other numbers are requests from the wedding guests. Say, Menny, it's a wig your daughter's wearing? - What wig? Like religious ladies wear. Is that the reason, or...? She's having chemotherapy. The kid is having chemotherapy? I wanted to tell you but then your band came in. I asked you to come early today so I could tell you, but you were late. Sorry. He didn't tell me much, either. - He didn't have the guts to tell me. Well? What? She's doing chemotherapy, and...? - It... stopped it from spreading but it's not working anymore. She needs a new treatment. Costs a fortune. There haven't been many studies done, she'll get ten treatments. They say the odds aren't bad. - What's "not bad"? Almost fifty-fifty. It's just a number. It's not in our hands. Our job is to do our best. Want anything else? More beer? That's what Noa had. Yeah? Yeah, is that what Noa had? Yes, it starts in the lymph nodes and spreads quickly. So like it's genetic? Yeah, it can be hereditary. - Daddy, come! -Just a minute, okay? I want "Fairytales in Rhyme." - Go get it. I can't do it. I'm sorry. Then go. And give him the money for the treatments. You can afford it. Give him your daily weed budget. How about that? Made a few bucks and you're a big man, huh? -You guys... Our friend is asking us for help. Why get into all the...? Can I get you anything? Everything okay? -We're fine. Is she asleep? -More or less. She's in bed with her book. Just keep it down, okay? You were talking about the money for the treatment. It costs 5,000 a month plus 3,000 for a loan I took to cover the expenses so far. Leave that. - That's 8,000 right off the bat. If the treatment works she gets another one and so on until she's clear. The whole thing takes about six months, maybe more. You each get $250 per night, I take $400 for doing the business side... We'll have another guy who plays violin and he'll help with the equipment. The fact that our band was pretty known will help us get clients. Listen... - They'll Google us... If it's just weddings, you don't need me. Any drummer will do, right? There are shitloads of drummers, didn't you say that? The treatments start now. A new drummer needs rehearsals. Sorry, I can't do it. I tried. If it's any help, I'll pay for the first treatment until you find a drummer. Pay me back when you can. We're in, bro. Keep us posted, okay? The CD. Danny. -What? Your offer to pay for the first treatment... - Yes? It'd be a big help. You mean how? There's an ATM three minutes away, if you can withdraw that kind of money. I can. I'll get the babysitter. Where's he going? Good evening. - Good evening. How are you? What's going on? - Thank God. -Fine. Careful there. Thanks, Sara'le. Thanks. Danny, sorry for pressuring you. Don't apologize. You got what you wanted. Move on. Danny, I can't do it without you. You're an asshole, you know that? - What? You heard me. He should've paid for the whole thing. Right? It'll be a bummer with a new drummer. I just hope he isn't some religious guy. It shall yet be heard In the cities of Judea And in the streets The streets of Jerusalem... What if she gets better? We'll keep playing weddings? We haven't even started, dude. And if she dies? Will he give up religion? I don't think so. Why would he stick with God after that? Where do you want us to take you? There's this great drummer who plays with me. Not the one you saw. He's playing at the Duplex now. Want to go see him? - Sure. I think he'll be into it. No need to. Danny said he'll do it. All right! Dude! Awesome! How'd that happen? It happened. - Yes! My man... Ta-ta-ta... Tastes. - Very good. What? Daddy, can you get me some wedding cake? - If there is any, sure. Keep going. "Walk, walked, "talk, talked, "help, helped, "run, runned..." - Ran. -Ran. Keep going. "Live, lived."” It shall yet be heard In the cities of Judea And in the streets The streets of Jerusalem It shall yet be heard In the cities of Judea And in the streets The streets of Jerusalem The sound of happiness, the sound of joy The voice of the groom, the voice of the bride The sound of happiness, the sound of joy The voice of the groom, the voice of the bride The sound of happiness, the sound of joy The voice of the groom, the voice of the bride The sound of happiness, the sound of joy The voice of the groom, the voice of the bride The bus to Safed leaves in 20 minutes, the bus to Safed leaves in 20 minutes. The bus won't wait. The sound of happiness, the sound of joy The voice of the groom, the voice of the bride The sound of happiness, the sound of joy The voice of the groom, the voice of the bride I almost got married to a religious woman in New York. I went to see a property for sale. This guy comes up and says: "I'll sell it to you if you'll marry my daughter.” Why, was she ugly? - Not in my opinion. In their standards there was something wrong with her. She was a little chubby, but a lot of these girls are fat. Anyway, he puts her in front of me and I can see it in her eyes, Goolie, "Please say yes." I was into her. I almost went for it. A $300,000 property for $180,000. And? What happened? I said no, of course. And her? - No idea. Did you know he almost married a religious chick? Almost. - They were pleased, thank God. Someone offered me another wedding. -Cool. Menny, next time can you fix us up with vests, neckties? For a good vibe? Keep the yarmulke on until we leave. Have some, for good luck. Here you go, bro. - Thanks. Here you go, bro. What's the matter, buddy? Here. Here you go. - Thanks. -Here, take this. Here. -Thanks, bro. - That's from both of us. Wow, thanks, bro. So, Menachem, when's the next wedding? Menachem, how old are you? - 43. Early 43 or late 437 In the middle. 43... You became religious late in life, right? Yes. How long since you became religious? About 15 years, not in one stretch. - 15 years... Single or divorced? Widowed. Widower with a six-year-old daughter. Six and a bit. So you were married, a six-year-old daughter... And you have a job? Yes, thank God, in a supermarket. I also have another side job. Making a good living? - Thank God. I also fill out two lottery tickets every week. So do I. God willing. - God willing. Have you been on many dates since? - I'm starting now. If not now, then when? And... any property? An apartment? People ask nowadays. My daughter's ill. There's a treatment, thank God, but it's expensive. I can't afford an apartment right now. What should I tell the girl? Tell her what I said. She doesn't have to be rich, either. You took the photo as you were, didn't dress up... Should I get a new photo? - When you get a chance. The matchmaker said you didn't want to see a photo. -No. No, I didn't want to start with looks. I just wanted to see if you had a beard and sidelocks, if you're Hassidic or not. I'm not so into Hassidism. I prefer a scholar. And how did I look in the photo? Hassidic. But I didn't want to rule you out right away. And you were kind of looking away so I wasn't really sure, and... actually, I wanted to give it a chance. I'm kind of into Hassidism. - Are you? Sometimes you can tell from a photo something about a person by his expression. Could be. Maybe I should start looking at the photos. No. I actually appreciate that. But a woman can tell more from a picture. Since this is my second time around... I don't want to compromise. I want a husband who studies Torah. I'm not really into Hassidism. I don't study as much as I'd like to. I work hard, then go home. - I understand. You must have to work harder now because of your situation. But I used to study in yeshiva. - You did? Yes. Now... But I'm glad I met you. And hearing about your daughter is inspiring. There's good in everything God does. Including this date. - You're right. Mind if I pay? Only if we can have another date. So I can pay next time. I really don't mind. I have a good job, thank God. If there is another date. It's all right, I don't date often. - I can ask my girlfriend. She's very special. She's also a bit of an artist like you, she does very special knitting work and she's very attracted to Hassidism. Tell her I gave you her number. Okay? Her name is Racheli. Goolie's on his way. He called to say his partner's late... What's with the white socks? They're socks. Are there rules? It has to be black, white? No, no rules. - They have to be white? The socks... -Usually it's black. It doesn't matter. Nobody sees them. - So you're a rebel. What? - "Usually it's black.” You still have... a rebellious side. Lovely doe Come into my garden Lovely doe Come into my garden The pomegranate has budded and my vine has blossomed The pomegranate has budded and my vine has blossomed If my beloved wanders too long How will I sit here alone? How will I sit here alone? Lovely doe Come into my garden Lovely doe Come into my garden The pomegranate has budded and my vine has blossomed The pomegranate has budded and my vine has blossomed What about your heart? It's like a zoo And where's God? Where's Hocus? Where? And what about life? Where's life? Hello. - Hello, Sara'le. Dollars... I only have dollars. That's okay. Next time. Okay. Thanks. Thanks, Sara'le. How much do you pay her? She's cute. How much, Menny? Does she work for free? - Ten shekels. Get out! Dude, I pay 40. It pays to be a rabbi. I think I scared her. I should've put my yarmulke on. I'll call her back and you can put it on. Daddy. Sorry if this is inconvenient, Menny. Come here, sweetie. You know, Geula, the new medicine won't make you vomit. It's better and it doesn't make you vomit. Can I have a glass of water, bro? Let's wash your face. I'm sick of her, too, fuck it. So what if she's sick of me? It's my house, too. Keep it down, okay? - Fuck it. She thinks she's perfect. Did you see her Facebook, Menny? Dude, she posts... photos of floor tiles. She thinks someone's interested. Dude, sorry for crashing here like this... Can you turn this thing off? Daddy. Man, we were good tonight... Yes, it's a big commandment to rejoice with the bride and groom. There were some nice moments. Now from your right hand to your left. Now from your left to your right. Now from your right to your left. That's it, Goolie. Now say the blessing. Say "bless you," Goolie. Bless you, Goolie. - No, "bless you." -"Bless you." "0 Lord..." - "0 Lord..." "King of the universe, who sanctified us..." "King of the universe, who sanctified us..." "And commanded us to wash our hands." - "And commanded us to wash our hands." Amen. That's it, Goolie. Now for the morning blessings. Now for coffee. Put a shirt on. She's not supposed to see tattoos. My bad... It's forbidden, huh? Menny, can I stay here another night? -No. It's just that... today's her first treatment so we won't be here. Is this the important treatment? They're all important. Then how will you play tonight? Will we have to cancel? Tonight's paying for the treatment. Listen, Menny, I wish you luck. If anyone deserves... - No such thing as "deserves," you get what you get, thank God. Goolie, can you come to the hospital with us? Close your eyes. Don't peek. You're peeking. Don't peek. Don't peek. Here you go. Want me to open it? Though I can open it by myself. - Yeah? Don't tear it! Daddy opens it fast and tears it. What do you do with the wrapper? Show my friends so they know I really got it. There we go. Tell me, Geula, who bought you more candy, Daddy or Mommy? Mommy. - Yeah? You know, once, before you were born, I was at your parents' wedding and Goolie threw at them lots of candy. - It's true. She's a sweetie. Were they happy? - Very. Even though one candy hit Daddy's nose. Daddy, Goolie gave it to me, can I? You think I'd give her something not kosher? There are all kinds of kosher, Goolie. - Really? Wait, we're not allowed to eat before the treatment. For eight hours. Keep it for me until afterwards. I'll keep it in my pocket for later, okay? Two, Zero, one, nine, three, four, eight... Send us joy For your mere existence Send us joy For your mere existence For your mere For your mere existence Joy, true joy That doesn't depend on anything Joy, true joy That doesn't depend on anything That doesn't depend That doesn't depend on anything That doesn't depend That doesn't depend on anything Send us joy For your mere existence Send us joy For your mere existence For your mere For your mere existence Joy, true joy That doesn't depend on anything Joy, true joy That doesn't depend on anything That doesn't depend That doesn't depend on anything That doesn't depend That doesn't depend on anything For your mere existence Yarmulkes. - That's mine. Joy, true joy... Tassels. Some wedding, huh? There were more people here than at our concerts. -Yeah. We were good, weren't we? - Thank God. You get a compliment, say thank you. Give him a break, his daughter's at the hospital. Okay, I'm waiting by the elevator. Bye. Hello. - Thanks. Sorry I have to go, it's my last bus. -Sure. Thanks for staying with her. Thanks. Sorry. -Gladly. How are you feeling? The doctors will tell me how it went, but let me tell you, you were very, very brave. Everyone here says so. Did you save my lollipop? I left it in Danny's car. I'll get it tomorrow, okay? -No... I'll get you the exact same lollipop tomorrow. - I wanted Goolie's lollipop. If I can't find it I'll buy the exact same lollipop, Geula. - No... Geula, I'll find the exact same lollipop tomorrow. Geula, I'll bring you the same lollipop tomorrow, okay? We were great, weren't we? You still have that autistic attitude. It's a big commandment to rejoice with the bride and groom. You know them? - No. That's the whole point, it's not for your ego, it's all for the mitzvah. What? Can you speak like a normal human being? Say something real. Talk to me. Can you? Had a bit to drink, Avi? Yeah. A bit. What? You know that Noa phoned me just before she died? She didn't tell you? She asked me to visit her, said she had nobody to talk to. So I went to the hospital. You were there. With little Geula. I waited for you to go and went in her room. We talked, joked around. I went again a week later. She wasn't able to talk anymore so I just held her hand. If I'd had another month I would've taken her back. Put on a yarmulke, whatever it took. You suffocated her, you and your self-righteousness. Menachem... The wedding ran late. No problem. - It was a real celebration. It ran late. I owe you 30 shekels. Get me a glass of water, please. Here. - Sara'le, go home. Go home. I owe her 30 shekels... You hear me? Stop asking her over. She shouldn't be seen with you. The matchmakers don't like it. You hear? You hear me? I owe her 30 shekels. - Give it to charity. Forget it. Daddy... Go back to bed. Take me by the hand, we'll rescue what we can Running in your footprints in the sand Don't look down, we won't fall Running in your footprints in the sand... Congrats! -Not bad, 250 bucks. - Did you see the bride? I know her parents from synagogue. - Eran! She's 6-foot-8... - Eran! What's happening, man? My man! How's it going? How are things? Hello, sir. - Hello. Eran, the lighting guy from the Roxanne. Used to come up after shows and say, "The sound sucked." Tell him, he's not updated. I'm still in the business. Now I own clubs. - He's modest. He owns the "Happy Hour" and "Kathmandu”. You've never heard of them? What are you doing here? - I came to hear some good music. Are you joking? - You won't believe it. Someone sent me a YouTube of you doing a wedding. I was glued to the screen. I made a few calls and came to hear you, before I ask you to play for me. - Do what? Play music, perform. - Wow, my man! -Awesome! I told you something would happen. - Amazing, man! The guy comes here, puts on a yarmulke... -Shut up. How was the last song? - You're great. The sound sucked. "The sound sucked..." Shall we sit down and discuss it? Now? - Now, tomorrow... Of course now! - I gotta go. His daughter's having treatment... Everything okay? - Thank God. You said the treatment went well. Yes. Give her my best. - Thank you. Is tomorrow better for you? No, the whole idea of playing in clubs... it's not for me. Sorry, guys, I've moved on. You don't have to decide now. Think it over. There's nothing to think over. The guy comes to this dump to see you, listen to what he has to say. - Eran, before we decide, you think there's an audience for this? - "Audience..." Call it "Jewish rock", people will come. - It doesn't matter. "High Beams" was an important band. People still talk about you. You know how much our last album sold? - Stop it! It was our second album, we tried new things, we knew it was hardcore. It was a great album. - Good album. There're also management issues. Things today are different. There's Facebook, Twitter. I can give each of you 20,000 up front, profits not included. We'll work out everybody's problems. That's exactly what you need. - I can't do it. Sorry. What happened? Your daughter's better so you don't need us anymore? Menny, listen to what he's offering. If the kid needs anything more, it's money up front. In your pocket. What? Afraid we'll drag you down? Are you that weak, Menny? Yes. Menny. Menny! Is she okay? Bye. Daddy, I had a dream. That's nice, honey. We'll tell the "mezuzah" about it later. Eat some tomatoes, the doctors told you so. Daddy, why are you sad in the picture? Aren't you eating your tomatoes? Finish up, sweetie, Daddy has to get to work. How are you? What's going on here? and we had to say goodbye to Mommy and I started crying and I was really sad... Geula, I'm late for work. - Wait, I'm not finished yet. Enough. We have to go. - No! I'm not finished. Geula, do you want Daddy to get fired? You want us to have money for the things we need? Let's go! Stop it! Geula... I'm sorry. Come tell your story. Let's go for it. Yeah? -Yeah. Yes! He has a boat to sell... To give away. Anchored and lost La la li li li la la... Stranded... In the storm you await him on the island And you're not the only one, he has an anchor in the ground There's no signal and there's nobody Following you... Go, Goolie. From the smell... Where are my clothes, anyway? Geula. Are you mad at me? Why do you say that? Because you don't come over anymore. That's right, I... We had a lot of time together because I was on vacation, I just graduated, but now I start studying again. You know what I'm learning? - What? To sew. To sew clothes. Remember I told you I like to sew? Your mom told me I'm good at it. Do you go to school at night, too? No, but... I have long days. Geula, come here, please. Go to Daddy. You said you were going out to play. Is it nice to lie? I was playing, with my ball. - You mustn't lie. I also wanted to ask Sara'le why she doesn't come over anymore. Because it makes it hard for her to find a husband. Hi. - Hello, how are you? Thanks for using your break-time to come. - No problem. Sorry to inconvenience you. Want anything? - No, thanks. Danny told me about... your daughter's situation, and I'd like to help if that's okay. Here's 5,000 shekels. It'll cover a month of treatments and save you running around to weddings. I don't know what to say. I don't even know you. Then don't say anything. I'll pay you back when I can. - No, no need. I mean, whenever it's convenient. Don't make it a priority. - Thanks. It'll be a big help, we were just talking about another treatment. Okay. That must mean the first treatment worked, right? No? What? It didn't work. They act like it did work. They want to give it another chance, catch the cancer off guard. Wow. I hope it works this time. Thank you. Danny doesn't know about this, so if you don't mind... I won't tell, don't worry. He's lucky to have a woman like you. This whole band thing... Do you have any new songs? Written anything? Actually, no. I'll tell you something about Danny and me. It's... We've been talking about getting married, starting a family, and suddenly he's... got more important things to do. It's... creating a distance between us, what you guys are doing. Do you really want this? I'm not so young, I really want to have kids, and... now he's saying it's not the right time... You know what I'm saying? I can't... I can't wait anymore. I'm 40. Think of it this way, you're helping me have a baby. I don't have to tell you what that means. It doesn't work that way. What way? You know that it's all... It's all Danny's money. The retainer and Eran's time. All of it. He brought Eran in. You really think Eran found you on YouTube? It's all about his ego. Don't kid yourself. Nobody will come to hear you. You'd be surprised, people still stop me on the street. I have to get back to work. Okay? I'm sorry. Hello, thanks for coming. We're excited to give you a taste of next week's show. There'll be time for questions afterwards. Enjoy. If it falls, it breaks If it's over, it's over Here it ends, for us it's just beginning Shards of wasted time Fell into the past Take me by the hand, we'll rescue what we can Running in your footprints in the sand Don't look down, we won't fall High beams on the hill Aimed at us A clear sign that we still have a chance Pulling onto the freeway There's grace in the air And children's laughter at the end of the path Like a spring in the desert From the earth comes One eternal truth, let's let it lead us Running in your footprints in the sand Don't look down, we won't fall High beams on the hill Aimed at us Running in your footprints in the sand Don't look down, we won't fall High beams on the hill Aimed at us A clear sign that we still have a chance If it falls, it breaks If it's over, it's over Skip over the glass and come with me I had tears in my eyes, man. Thank you, Menachem. That was really touching. Thanks. Amazing. Congratulations. You were amazing. People will love it. Sorry... I'm sorry... I don't know what's with me... What? I love him, I... it isn't working. I don't know why. Aspirations? Good health... for everyone. For all of us. - And regarding the music? Whatever God wants. And for you? Everything He gives me is a gift. Where does Avi end and Menny begin? Who cares? - Our listeners. Unity is a great thing. Why separate? - Nice. A message for your admirers? Don't admire us. - Sweet... First love? Bob Dylan. You don't say. Pray or write songs? Is it one or the other? You haven't written a song in 15 years. When I became religious I wanted to study Torah before I started writing again. I felt I... wasn't strong enough, I wasn't in a strong enough place to handle both. You are afraid... You are afraid that... if I went back to writing it would ruin everything, all the beautiful things. Really beautiful things that saved you. You are afraid if you start writing again you'd go back to that bad place. So I studied. But it wasn't what I expected, studying Torah. So I stopped studying. I realized I'm no scholar, and life just swept you away. Life... You say, "Let's wait another year, maybe it'll happen."” And a few years later you look back and realize... there's no way back. It's closed off to you. And you're scared. You're suffocating... but it's like a mountain in front of you... you don't have the strength to climb. So you stay in your comfort zone. You stay wherever you are. I know that some people can do both, there's Shuli, Shuli Rand, there's Eviatar, but I'm not like them. I don't know... maybe I'm just a lie, maybe... Are you okay? You need some water? What's the matter, Menny? What's wrong, bro? - Everything okay? I thought that Avi is the stoner... - Maybe he's not the only one. - Here. - Give us a second. Menny, are you okay? What's with you? - What? -Hey! Forget it... count me out. Out of what? - Everything. I tried. I can't do it. Pissed off because Channel 2 wanted to interview me? It's not all about you. - Nobody cares about you, Avi, or me either. - Why the bad vibe? It's all a lie. -Dude, it's all good. - Who cares? Why do you say that? - You think anyone cares if we play? All I have to say... - Stop it, Menny. -It's all a lie, it's all for your ego, and yours. - Avi said such nice things about you. Tell him what you said. I don't care! It's a lie, I don't want to hear it! I'm not into it. -I'm into it. And I want a decent stage and I want money and I want to get laid after shows. - That's enough, man. When did you ever get laid in a club? It's not like that anymore, that's not the vibe here. Ehud Banai performs here. - Not that again... It's all a lie. - Why is it a lie? What happened? Why is it a lie? -What lie? - What happened, Menny? Menny... - Stop it, what happened? What happened? Why'd you change your mind? Chill, man. It's all right. - It's all a lie. Why do you say that? Why is it a lie? Ask him. Menny, I really want you to play here. And next week's show is happening, it's for real. What do you mean, real? What are you talking about? Huh? I called Eran. I put down the money, okay? Eran wouldn't have come otherwise. Okay? You put down the money? - That's right. -That's how it works, you get an investor. You think I want to lose my shirt over your band? Rock'n'roll. Enjoy it. What did you pay for? - Everything. PR, covering losses, the retainers, everything. All right. What difference does it make? Goodbye. Avi, what does it matter? - Let go. -Avi, what does it matter? Avi, what does it matter? - Let go! Avi, what does it matter? - Let go. Can't stand someone helping you? You're a loser! Loser! A loser, that's what you are! Why did you do this? Menny... Cool it, Menny. Chill. Give me a sign. If it flies away, You're on my side. If it flies away, You're on my side. Now. Yes. Give her a spoonful of medicine. That happens when she has a headache. It should help. Her head? Tell her I'm on my way. Tell her Daddy's on his way. Mrs. Keister? Geula! Geula! Mrs. Keister! Geula! We are sorry, we are unable to complete your call right now. Geula! Geula! Have you seen Geula? Geula! Geula! Geula! Geula! Geula! Menachem, she's with us. The babysitter couldn't reach you so she brought her here. Please don't let this happen again. Sara'le, sit down. Israel, get him a glass of water. Menachem... Sorry, my mother doesn't know you like I do. It's all right. She doesn't know what I want. I listened to your songs. I thought about them a lot. Thank you. I'm very touched to hear that. Good night, Sara. Four, eight, two, zero, one, nine... Look, Daddy, fish. See? Hey... Hello there. How are you, Geula? - Okay. Are you here to see me or him? You. And him. But you more. You can take a chair from there. There was a boy there but he's gone now. His name was Ephraim. Or you can sit here next to me. It's okay you didn't bring me anything, I can't have it anyway. Does it hurt anywhere? When it hurts I press this and the nurse comes. Want to see? Yeah. Clear out, please, I have to check her. Are you in pain, honey? - A little. This is the last chance. We'll keep at it only if this one works. Want me to wait with you? I'm already here. You were right. Two days before they told us it was malignant she told me she wanted a divorce. If not for the cancer she would've left me. You don't know what to think, you become a machine, you do what has to be done. Treatments, doctors... And now what? Looking for a girl? I just started. Good for you. How's it going? What's it like? Weird. Not like we're used to. You meet once and it's yes or no. They usually say no. Why? If you don't mind me asking. My situation, my daughter. It's a burden. I'm a burden. Sometimes it's just because I'm not a scholar. So say you're a scholar. Will they test you? That's not right. I'm not a scholar. - So you're not a scholar. One really felt sorry for me, she gave me a number and said: "I have a girlfriend who isn't looking for a scholar." Go for it. I know from experience, girifriends are the best. Listen to this. Once I had this girl, just a girl... she left me. But she had this Moroccan girlfriend, a real hottie... Dr. Naor wants to see you. The results were good. We're going for another treatment. Take it as... You know, it's an adaptation. Anyway, I think we should do one more reggae version or something. Think it over. -What? - Do a reggae version... Let's do it at the next wedding. Do "Give Us Joy" reggae style. You can pull that off easy. - Why not? We'll do it dubstep... Daddy! Daddy! What is it? It's like the lollipop that Goolie gave me that you left in the car. It's a miracle, right, Daddy? Let's take it home. With the ants and all. Look, Daddy, they're eating the lollipop. Eat up, cuties, it'll make you healthy and strong. Lalli, Lalli, come here. I want to show you something. Remember when I came home and didn't know where you were? I stood here and yelled out the window. What did you yell? - I called you. "Geula! Geula!" Yell like you did then. I'd rather not. Please, Daddy. I'll scare the neighbors. - C'mon, Daddy! Geula! Geula! You're funny, Daddy. It's true.
