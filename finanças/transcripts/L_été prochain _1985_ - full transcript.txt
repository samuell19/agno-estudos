It is good to laugh while making love! One never dares? We love each other… Yeah… It is shitty, you know… No, it's not shitty… That is life! -No… -No, what? I'm an old man, you know. Of course not, that is not what your body says. My body, is completely dumb, it does whatever it wants. Actually, I would need four more like you to feel really good. Well, for me, to feel really good, I would need zero. Then kiss me. Kiss me while you think about it! Born being a pain in the ass? Do you think… I did it all by myself… The hospital is still busy! I will call a cab! Do not scream, Mom! This is a new child, this is life! Yes, of course, life… But I do not care about life. I'm in pain! Farou! Did you fix it? The battery is dead! You have to turn the headlights off at night! It was not me who drove the car last night! Come on. -My mother is giving birth. -But… Farou, go up front. -It is okay, Mom. You will be fine. -Come on, let's hurry! Get in the car. It's okay. -It's all right. -No, it's not! -Yes, it's okay. -Come on, let's get in. Well, do not be shy! You will not invade my car! -Is there a problem? -No, it's nothing! Great. This is not the time for daydreaming. Saint-Vincent hospital, straight ahead! I know where it is! -Come on, let's go down! Giddy up! -You are crazy! Here you go, madame. You will be able to bring your beautiful baby at the right place. -Mom, come on! -Thank you. Hold on just a little more. That is it, right here, Mom. Manuel, call the doctors! -The doctors! -Wait. I hope this one will not be that stupid. Wait, maybe I will call her? Do not! Come on! -Hurry! It is my mother! -The stretcher! Wait, I will lift you! -Come on, Mom! -Slowly! -Get out of the way! -Come on! The elevator! Come on! -Slowly! -Faster! -Slowly! -Come on, Mom! Let us in! Come on! The stairs, quickly! We are coming, Mom! Get out of the way! -Come on! -Breathe, Mom! -Easy, kids. -Be careful, the door. Easy. -This way. -Easy. -Mom, give us a little boy. -A boy, Mom! -No, a girl! -A boy! Enough! -I'm tired of girls, really. -Enough is enough! Kids… Tuscany… The olive tree hills… The cypresses… The small pink villages, dotting the countryside, as field flowers. You will see how beautiful it is. -Can we go tomorrow? -Yes, tomorrow! Of course, why not? We will go on horseback, through the purple wreath and rhododendrons, to get the curdled milk and eggs at a farm. Which farm? Well, a farm. We will see, right? There are farms everywhere. There is a call for you, Mr. Séverin! It is urgent! I'm coming, madame. Excuse me. -I will take it… -No, in the office. In the office. Good morning, madame. Hello, yes? That is me. No, Sidonie, sweet heart, I was at the very end of the garden. How are you? -It's my daughter. -What did he say? -Yes. -I do not know! How wonderful… Yes. Yes, I will be right there. I have a daughter. Congratulations. My little girl… He is moved. That is normal, at his age. First child? No. No, this is the sixth. It's a beautiful girl. She weighs eight lbs. She is going to be tall. PHOTOS ARE ISSUED HERE Like Sidonie, Jude wanted to be a pianist. CITY CONSERVATORY Like her, he lived in Saint-Martin, city closest to the family cottage, yet, they had never met. On the day of her contest, Sidonie, out of panic, begged us all not to come see her perform. Miss Sidonie Séverin! -It was great! -You think so? Well done. Mr. Frédéric Place? NO SMOKING Thank you. For what? For your smile. Did I smile at you? Jude! Miss Rémy. -Well, then… -No. Could you wait for me? Yeah. -We miss you, you know. -Yes, I will come to see you. -I'm with a friend, please excuse me. -Of course. I was looking for you. No. These are mine, they will never leave me. -I need them! -I need them more than you do. -I'm in Paris half the time. -Why Paris? To study the piano. You will see, there we make giant steps. You would love it. I would? My little girl! We did not come in, you see! We did not want to bother you. So, how did it go? Did you make a hit, baby girl? Are you introducing me? Hello. She was gorgeous, right? I'm not surprised, she is my daughter. What a lesson! What mastery! What class! Little punk! Did you hear me? No, but I did not have to! I know you, right? Come on, champagne! A success is worth celebrating. Are we going to America? Not right away. Next summer. Why is it always next summer? Why is it always next summer? Because my car is still broken down, Juliette. Sidonie? -How are you? -I'm fine. -Well, that is great. -Yeah. That is my brother. On the piano, she is kind of bad. But apart from that, she is pretty nice. -Right, Dad? -Farou, stop talking nonsense. As you see I cannot start the car. -Well, what is going on? -Sir, do you mind if… Just a little. -Thank you! -Sidonie? How did it go, my love? She blew them all away! -Is that not right, Mr… -Jude Delaux. I am her sister. Half-sister. From our dad’s side. We do not have the same mother. Why would he care? What? There is no shame! Mom is not here because she just gave birth. It's a habit of hers. She is either breastfeeding or giving birth. It has been going on for years. You are not pushing hard enough, kids! You talk too much, there! So, daddy-in-law, is the car "daddy-dead" again? It's exhausting, the family. Right, Paul? No, it is alright… And for Sidonie? Is it glorious or is it the end? She cried so much she got them with pity. She did it? No way, she must have flirted with one of them. Manuel! This is my other brother. They are crazy. You are lucky, I came just in time. Who are you calling crazy? I love you. Come on, kids, push! Come on, Dino! The good girl! Lazy? A big vine… There are some days blessed by the gods. We wish that these moments never end. Paul was happy. He had finally finished writing his play. And he was staging it. It was the story of a couple who were a lot like us. I can even call it stealing the essence from our relation. It's good to laugh while making love! One never dares, right? -We love each other… -Yeah. -It's shitty, you know… -No. No, it's not shitty. That is life! It's beautiful, Paul. That is beautiful, man! I do not know what to tell you. I'm moved, see! You did not laugh? You did not laugh? Laugh? No, I held back! I did not want to disturb you! I know how to behave, what do you think? All of you are funny, that is great. Very, very funny. You made me die of laughter! -Not me, though? -You? You are… You are great! That is it! No, I just came by. I will give you a kiss. Well done, Paul. Well done. -Your daughter is here. -My daughter! Where are you? My love! My flesh, my blood! All right, hugs to you all, by the way. That is easy. Well done. Well. So. Let's take a break. Go grab some lunch. -Turn off the lights when you leave. -Okay. This is great. But beware, Paul… Number three is not quite ready. What do you blame him for? I thought he was the best. He is too slow. I think he is… Jacques, he is embarrassed in his monologue. But I cannot go back! I should never have agreed to the conditions of the producers. I got screwed, that is all. I cannot, now it is too late. But delay it by a week! I know you, Paul. In one week, you can turn things around. You think so? Yes, I do. I have done it before, right… Yeah. Well, I'm going to call them. Are you coming? No… I have to hurry if I want to catch my plane. Are you leaving? You are leaving me? No, listen… It's only for two days. You know, I will just go to discuss a contract and come back. It's for the decoration of a new restaurant in Rome. It's very important to me. You see? But you knew that, Paul! I told you so. Yes, but I forgot! With all this! But I understand. It's normal, I get it. Leave me here, leave me in my shit. Call the producers! Ask them for a week! They will give it to you, it will pay off. Will you call them, Paul? I do not know. Perhaps, yeah. Do not worry about me. Hurry up, you will miss your plane. I'm staying. Really? Are you sure? Absolutely. Come on! Let's go. How sweet you are, Dino! I do not want it to affect your job, okay? No, do not worry. No, because… One thing is essential, never forget it. Your profession is essential. I never understood who bought those boots from daddy. I do not know, honey. I do not think anyone does. What do you care? As long as we eat. Here we go again. Manuel! Dad is here. No, not this! Hello, kids. How many orders? There are mostly a lot of rejections. How much are we asking for? Two hundred francs? -Send one for a hundred francs? -Do you think it will work? Of course it will! They do not know what they want! Where are the orders? Here! It's better than nothing! This week, we are strapping our belts. Juliette, my dolly! -Do you have my present? -Yes, I have your gift, love. Here it is! Are we going to the party? Yes, we are going to the party. Let's ask mom. Mommy! Are you ready? Go ahead! I will join you! Come on, let's go ahead. The two of us are going first, Juliette. You will join us, right? This bias for the little minxes… What a shame! As long as they have a pussycat, everything is fine. That is true. We… We never did anything to her pussycat, to Sidonie's! That is not nice. But now, Mr. Jude is the one taking care of it. By the way, is he performing well? Is little Sidonie satisfied? I will let you clean these, you little bastards! Let's get out of here! I know very well that you are here, snooping around. …HOW MUCH I MISS YOU… MY ISABELLE! Dino is waiting for you, the others have left! Come on… Just go. I will take care of her, I prefer it that way. You know I hate parties. Are you okay, Mom? I'm tired. Is Édouard bothering you? Please, Dino, do not ask. All right. All right. You are beautiful. The weather is nice. There is a party. Let's make the most of it! What is this? A gift from Dad. She is not baptized. But Mom, it is just for fun! You are pretty, my love. But never make fun of others. Never. -I'm not making fun of anyone. -I know that. But not the others. Communion, for believers, is sacred. Do you understand? Well, listen, Mom, the girl is not doing anything wrong! Dad, do not twist everything I say! Let's go! Let's put on your beautiful red dress! Come on, chop, chop! Let's get dressed! Our children are beautiful, right? Did I shock you with the dress story? -You still believe in God, right? -Who remembers what I believe in? How could I know? By asking me, for example! By talking to me! But it is beyond your strength! I'm your wife! Not any wife! All this fuss for a dress, well! You used to laugh! I have changed. I hate it when you are like this. I do not care at all! You do not want to appeal to your husband? I do not want to suffer anymore. Who is talking about suffering, Mom? Have fun! Come on, let's dance! You do not want to dance with me? I do not know when it started. What? When did what start? You have become a stranger, Édouard. I look at you, and I see a stranger. Is someone there? Who? Me. What have you done to Jeanne? Nothing! Dino… No, you know, I think she has this famous depression that all women have after giving birth. Yeah. Maybe she has that famous depression of women, whose husband likes to please too much. Everyone likes to please. Dino… It's normal, right? Come on, let's dance with daddy. Life is great, right? Simple people… are happy. I love them. And Jeanne? Do you love her? Well, of course! I mean, she gave me six children. What do you take women for? Incubators? She does not care about love, Jeanne. She wants something else. Well, alright, what does she want? What you promised her. What did you love her for 20 years ago? For the children you gave her? Shut up! Dino! It's always the same with you, we cannot talk! You do not understand anything! Yes, well, me, if in 20 years, Paul loves me because I am the mother of his children, I'm going to beat the crap out of him with his love! So, what do you expect from Paul? Everything. You are going to suffer, my love. You will suffer. It's funny how… You women can be so exhausting. Demanding. It's not the same thing. Demanding, if you would like, yeah… But in the past, when you were not… it was so much better. -My mother… -Your mother was miserable. My mother loved her husband, her children, her house, she was happy! -Unhappy! -Happy! And resigned. She told you? No, but… you could see it. How? What? Dad loved her. He also loved the young flower girl. Who told you that? She was cheerful, the young flower girl… She was very curvy. She cheered him up. But he also loved mom. He was a very good dad. Yes, but a man, especially if he is good, cannot make two women happy. You have some theories, right? I do not like when Jeanne is sad. Neither do I, Dino. I do everything I can to make her happy. Why are you cheating on her? Because I'm cold. -What do you mean? -I'm cold. When I'm far away, all alone, I'm cold. And a woman is warm. It's nice. It's the sun. You know, my little Farou, women… Do not worry about mom. She will make it in the end. Yeah. You think so? They always make it in the end. You know, there are times when they scare me. That's true. They are healthy, tough. Nothing brings them down. In the evening, they cry, the next day, they get up and start again. But you are a fool for getting married. And twice, as well! -Do you see what I see here? -A woman? -American. -Swedish. Half-American, half-Swedish, in my opinion. Dad, it has been forever since Dino and Sidonie left! Shall we go home? Come on, this time it is real! Next year, I'm taking you all to America! We will have a two-door Cadillac! You will see how beautiful it is! -Have you ever been there? -No, I have not. Never. Why do you say it's beautiful then? Living as a couple is a pain in the ass. You mean you and Jude never… No! If we have very exceptional dealings, it's precisely because we each have our own place. So what? We end up with crazy impulses. We miss each other. That pulls the love very high, really. Then at least, we do not have any habits, that… I love habits. The habit of a body, its heat… The habit of laughing together! In the end… I love sharing. And what would you say if Jude asked to live with you? -I would tell him no. -No? -Really? -Really. Well, I imagined you agree to everything he asks for. Delightedly. And a bit mouthy, too. To become the shadow of its shadow and the shadow of his hand. The shadow of his dog. Well, thank you. And have a good wank. You are rude! Cheer up. Do not worry, dad. We will get them. Mom! Mommy! Open the door! Open up, Mom! You are mean, Mom. I'm cold. -Are you going on a trip? -Yes, I'm. For how long? You are not too cold, are you? -Are you okay? -For how long? I don't know. You could have told me, right? What is the point? You would have discussed it… Yeah? Where are you going? What are you doing right now? Arranging my pencils. This is very important. I want them in order of size. I'm naturally quite bohemian, but when it comes to pencils, I'm uncompromising. Do not touch them. -Never. -Off to a great start. We are going to travel a little. Do you want to? A little? Maybe a lot. We will see. What are you doing? Do you think you could explain it to me? Mom, please… First of all, my name is Jeanne! I cannot believe it! Apart from being the good-looking hero who finally goes home, haloed with fatigue! And me, poor fool, who tells children to keep it down, because daddy is tired! Poor dad! With all his grueling travels, I think he is tired. But what do you think I do on these trips? Have fun? When you are back, I will expect the things you never do! -Like what? -Talk to me! Look at me! I know, Édouard, you are a good father. This little sentence is ridiculous. I hear myself saying to others: "Édouard is a good father." I know I'm saying this to make myself feel better. To compensate for the bad husband. Why did you not tell me all this earlier? I have tried, mind you. And every time, "later", "tomorrow", "I'm sleepy"! Listen, Jeanne! I mean… We are happy together! We are not together anymore! There is another woman in your life. It's not true! There is no other woman! Not really. And this Isabelle? Is she not a woman? Well! Isabelles, they do not matter. Because there were others? Deep down, I knew that. You know I'm right. We should not talk, we are hurting each other. We hurt each other, for nothing, it is… Listen… Jeanne… We will not end up like this? -I promise you… -You have made too many promises! All sworn! It's over! Are you crazy? What about the children? You will see them whenever you want! Where? Where will I see them? If you want, I will leave! But what am I going to do with the little ones? ARTS AND RECREATION THEATER So? They were assholes. They did not laugh once, not one smile. But you were in the back of the theater! You could not hear them! -You can feel the smiles, believe me. -And what did you feel? That they would have rather been at the battlefront. -And the actors, how were they? -Lousy! Just like my play, or my staging, for that matter. Tonight I understood that no one could identify with this couple. That will teach me. Teach you what? That will teach me to stop doing autobiographical work. It's true, in life, I sometimes find your lines funny. In fact, they suck. Mine do too, for that matter! Our couple sucks! That is not true! What you say is compelling, but obviously, said by someone else, it is not the same! And you are telling me this tonight? Thank you, Dino. Wait until tomorrow to worry! Wait for what? The critics! You did a great job. There is no way they will not see that. Well, you see, the worst thing is, when you make a flop, it is the consolation of misery from your loved ones. This is to cry for! I would have loved it if you had come forward, when the Spanish rejected my project. Which project? Nothing, I just said it. No, please, Dino, no more of this between us! -What project is it? -Nothing, I told you… If it is nothing, why do you talk about it if it is not important? It's not the time, is it? Honestly! Are you sleeping in all your clothes now? I'm cold. You are right, it is freezing in here. She does not give a damn that I made a flop, stupid bitch… But you are a monster! When I'm anxious, I get hungry. It's not my fault. You’re eating a carrot at four in the morning, next to me, knowing that I'm an insomniac, that the slightest noise wakes me up, and that I'm in the process of screwing up my work! Fuck! Shut up! What are you shouting about? Do you want to wake everyone up? What if we get evicted? Where will we sleep? I don't care where I sleep. I don't care, believe me! I don't give a damn! -What I want is to sleep! -You are a lunatic! A neurotic! Are you making a scene because I'm eating a carrot? You are not eating a carrot! You brought 40,000 drums into my eardrums at 4 a.m. on purpose, that is what you are doing! And mean as well? And concerned about his precious sleep. You know I see you check the time every morning to see if it is enough. -Human calculator! -Hysteric! Yes, but I like that. Hysteric, it has a ring to it! Whereas you are an human calculator! Since that is how it is… Come on! Get out! Open up! I locked myself out. Listen, Dino, open up! Open up, Dino! I'm barefoot! Don't be silly, Dino… Your trick is not funny! Dino? I forgot my keys. And what is that noise? That is my wife eating carrots. She is hungry at night. -At night? -Yes. My wife always wanted to talk at night. To have discussions. What kind of discussions? I never knew. Besides, I always fell asleep. Yes, that is one of their specialties. Let me tell you that the day my wife died I was delighted! Delighted! Mine, unfortunately, is very healthy! Yes, but your wife, she is a very beautiful woman! Mine was ugly, fat and mean, as well! She was pissing me off. Dino! -Where are you going? -To sleep! And eat carrots! Where? I will never sleep again with this bitch, who leaves at any time, to who knows where… Only, now, my friend, you no longer have an excuse. She left you the room. But you are starting to piss me off, you… Mind your own business. Finally, Paul's play was a success. We were going to Paris. Then to America. America. Thanks to dad. This country was part of our dreams. Every summer, he promised us. What was incredible is that we believed him every time. For the occasion, Édouard and Jeanne were again side by side, like a couple. And I was torn between the happiness of leaving and the sadness that gave me the certainty that never again, we would be so close to each other. After us, it was the turn of Jude and Sidonie, who went to Paris, to live off their art. This is how the family ceased to be just one place. A sacred place called home. AND SEVEN YEARS PASSED… Sidonie and I never left each other. A single cloud in our lives, her inability to perform in public. She was afraid. Despite me, despite the son we had, Sidonia had remained frigid. Where is the big gray dog? Crocus! How is that big, gray, ugly, nasty dog? Are you hungry? We do not risk indigestion, my friend… Édouard, previously so fickle, lived like a monk. Come here, Crocus! During the school vacations, he would take the younger kids. The others often came to see him. However, he felt a little lonely at times. What do we do now? Should we call Paul? That old Paul! Paul had stopped believing in tomorrows. He lived the present hour with despair. And as if it was not to be followed by any other. In a moment of dismay, we had decided that our love should in no way interfere with our freedom. And since he was the only one, that could heal me from the wounds he had made, I would rush into his arms. He would welcome me with distraught gratitude, a tenfold love. We loved each other. We were miserable. On weekends, the cottage was full, just like it used to be. Jeanne knew how to keep its life. And warmth. And for all of us. it had remained our haven. You made me fall! Juliette! Come on! You see, they do not need me anymore. It's over, you see. Do not talk bullshit, it's temporary. Seven years? Talk about a temporary crisis… I'm miserable. I know. In bed, that is all there is to it! But I still want to play! I'm not your mother, you will listen to me! Mommy! She refuses to go to bed! Moumouche, why? I'm not sleepy! Every night, same thing. To annoy the world, that, she knows how to do. I do not want you, I want mom! Here is your mother. Goodbye! Moumouche! Little whims… For once I have to go out, be good, listen your sister. Why do you have to go out? You are not going to do this again? Go ahead where you have to be. I will take care of her. Thank you. -Sidonie! -Mom! Jude is performing in Geneva tonight, I wanted to surprise you… You are beautiful! Did you do something to your hair? And this dress, where does it come from? You should have told me. Tonight I'm going out to dinner. You, going out to dinner? Why? I mean, with who? You don't know them. Friends of mine. I don't know them? Well, go ahead, to your dinner, Mommy. I'm going to eat with the girls, I haven’t seen them in a while. It's silly, I don't see you that much. See you later, Jude is meeting me here. Come on. -I will be quick. -No, do not be like that! Enjoy your evening, you look great! And without remorse, right! Sido… -How are you? -Juliette! So? I'm going to bed! Moumouche! Come on, let's go to bed! Sidonie, I'm in love. Really? -He does not know it yet. -Let's go to bed! Yes, but if you love him, he will love you. If life could be so easy… I really have to go. Not so fast, though? Sidonie, whom I see so rarely… I have already understood that, you have told me six times. I'm sorry. I'm as well. I know how wonderful you are. I'm not ungrateful. Thanks to you, Juliette has discovered the desire to read. And write! Yes, that is it, I'm a wonderful teacher, Juliette is lucky to have found me, but all this for now, I do not give a damn. You know that very well. Jeanne. I really have to go. -Are you mad at me? -Yes, I'm. -It's really not my fault. -Yes, I know. Goodbye. Thank you. It was very good. Goodbye. I know I'm being ridiculous… but I cannot. Mom, it's good to have fun, you are the youngest and the most beautiful mom. I have to go. See you soon, I love you. Were you not sleeping at Marie Lou's? She kicked me out. She is an idiot. Why? Because she's sick of me? Yes. You are home early too. It's the night of flops at the Séverins. You know, I was just having dinner with Juliette's teacher. That is all. Yeah. I even saw the teacher's face… Tell me, Mom… Do you miss dad? I don't know. Sometimes, yes. -Let's have one last drink! -No, it's too late. Too late, what are you talking about? The night has just begun! You are free! Lucky man. I'm not. See you tomorrow. You are hindering me, Dino! Do you understand? You are hindering me. Because I want to be with you? No, but I do too, I want to be with you… But not 24 hours a day. It's a love killer! I do not care about love! I just want your presence! What you are saying is terrible! Can you realize that? You are a monster! Yes! I'm a monster. Thanks to you. Yes! You said that there was nothing more precious than our love. You said that there is nothing more precious than our freedom. -That it made us beautiful. -Did I say that? -Yes, you used to say that. -Well, I have changed. -That is easy… -No, it's not. It's very difficult. It's really hard. You do not know how hard it is! Dino… Are you upset? Do whatever you want, Paul. I will be sleeping. We just cannot do it anymore. Yes, we can! But that's nothing! This is a crisis! A necessary crisis. Both of us, it's forever, you know! You know, I have to protect us. That I protect us from you, from your thirst for the absolute. Against the habit. Against sleepiness! You can say that again. I have one of those sleep delays… I'm wondering if I should go to a clinic for… How awful! But you are crazy, that is very unhealthy! -Are you bored with me? -No, I'm not. I'm not. But I would like to… What would you like? I would like to get bored… I dream of being bored, Paul… Really. I love you when you are like this. I love you when you are sad, like this… Do you like me more when I'm cheerful? I do… Yes, I do as well. But you see, in a couple, you have to be surprised. You have to be surprised all the time. If we can keep getting surprised, we can live together for a thousand years. There is the idea of having to surprise you for a thousand years. Well, listen, I'm really exhausted. Are we not fine like this, both of us? What? Yes. You are not happy now? Yes. We will tell ourselves that this is the last time. What? That way, it will be more… more beautiful. It will be rarer. Thank you. Goodbye! -You are not going to the theater? -Yes, I am. What is the matter with you? What can I do for you? -Can I make a phone call? -To where? -Here. -Go ahead, it's direct. Thank you. -Hello? -Hello, yes? Théâtre des Célestins, what can I do for you? Good evening. A woman who just had a car accident is in my house. She was supposed to play at your theater tonight. Hold on, please. There is a call for you! Miss Séverin… No, she is at my home, but she is in a shock, she cannot come to the phone. Not too serious? No, no, a car accident… Fortunately, the car took the most serious blow. Is there anything we can do? She just wanted me to let you know. She is worried about missing her concert. Yes, I assume so. Listen. Tell her I will call her tomorrow. Good evening, thank you. Can I call Paris this time? Go ahead. Hello? Hello? It's me. How are you? Fine, I decided not to perform. Are you kidding me? Of course I'm… Well…You scared me. Are you two okay without me? We do what we can. Tiranos ate well, he has done his homework. He is in bed. What about you? Is it crowded? I think so. How are you feeling? I'm fine. I should have come. No. It's better this way. -You think so? -I'm sure. -Sure. -Sidonie… You know that you are a great pianist. The best one? Sidonie… I'm with you, my love. I know, Jude. Goodbye. See you tomorrow. I knew it. What are you doing here? I drove 600 km to listen to you, that is what I did. Two brandies. Four. What did they say? They said you were in a minor car accident. Were you scared? No, why would I be? I have been looking for you. I cannot do it, Farou. I'm never going to make it. To your future, baby sister. What are you going to tell him? I'm going to tell him that it worked out pretty well, that I'm pretty happy with myself. What? What would you say to him? The truth. No, I cannot do that. You are on your own. I'm on my own? Farou… Thank you. Sidonie, my love! Where have you been? I was so scared when I called the theater. Are you okay? Is it true? Yes, I'm fine. I thought I would die. Come on, calm down… Next time, I will go with you and everything will be fine. Yeah, talk about a virtuoso who needs her babysitter. So what? Who is going to know about it? And later, when you get recognized, it will be your particularity. Your originality, your legend. The great Sidonie Séverin cannot perform without the look of the man she loves. Are you making fun of me now? Absolutely not! Not at all. But then, tell me… The car, it's not damaged? It's ruined. I pushed it into the ravine! You always overdo it, you do. -Hello? -Jeanne? -Dino? -Dad had an accident. I'm taking him to Sainte-Claire's Hospital in Nice. It's pretty bad. He is asking for you. I understand. I'm on my way. Dad? Do not worry. Everything will be fine. Yes. We will take care of you. Yes. What? Come on… Trust me. Everything will be fine. Come on… Go ahead. It's going to be okay. I'm waiting for you. I'm waiting for you. Go. PHYSICIANS, INTERNS It's my father. Please sit down. No. No, I will be fine… Sit down, so you do not fall down. I'm not ready for this. We rarely are. Drink it up. Drink up. Easy. Take a deep breath. Feeling better? Thank you. It's Dino. Dad had an accident. I'm with him at the Sainte-Claire Clinic in Nice. It's bad. You have to come. Sending you hugs. While I was dead, it was cheerful. And it's not cheerful. But that is… Those are the rules… You are too young to be here. You are not doing the trick where you make me younger, to make you younger? It does not work. You should remove everything, now. Do not worry, I will take care of it. By the way, who are you? What are you doing here? Are you a nurse or an intern? Either way, you are really cute… Do not worry, it is normal. I'm your daughter, Sidonie. You just had surgery. You were asleep for a long time, but now you are okay. It's over. Sidonie… I talked to you for an hour, and I did not realize it was you. It's normal you did not recognize me, Dad. I have a blouse and a cap. Why are you dressed like that? Dino… Sido… I just thought that we were reaching the age when our parents die. -Hi. -Hello. Are you okay? He did not even recognize me. We cannot let him live like a vegetable, Farou. Not him! -Not dad. -Stop it, Sidonie. It will not happen. You mean… A friend had lent us her house. The accident had to happen so that we all end up under the same roof. Just as we used to. One by one. the family members were coming in. We all tried to hide our feelings so we would not break down, and we naturally found the tone of our mocking childhood. For three long weeks, we would take turns at dad's bedside, who was never to be left alone. How are you? Try to sleep. Each of us was discovering or was checking out the importance of the father who had given us life. A light, strolling, sunny idea, which had never left us. Give me a cigarette. When did you get here? Just a while ago. Everyone was asleep, impossible to get the address of the clinic. Dino is there? Yes, this is his turn. We share the nights, it's easier. How is he? We don't know for sure. Paul, my love… Finally, I loved you for who you are. Was that not the worst thing I could do to you? Not a very cheerful moment. What do you think, Dino? If you had seen them with all the tubes keeping them alive… We are ungrateful. We are ungrateful? Because we do not need tubes? Here I have… I have been thinking a lot about us. That is nice. We are alive, do you understand? No, I do not. What are you trying to say, darling? Instead of destroying ourselves, let's leave each other. Tell me I'm right, Paul. No. You are wrong. Paul is sleeping with Manuel? What did he tell you? That you made him feel bad. Really? Nobody is making anybody feel bad. We are breaking up. That is all. Will you please sleep with me? Excuse me, Jude. I stole your wife last night. I saw that. Your father, how is he? He says death is no big deal. He is going to be fine. He loves life too much to leave like this. His sister lives here, we should tell her. You are lucky to have a large family. You mean when there is no one, there is still someone? Am I disturbing you? Would you like some coffee? Right, I'm still part of the family. Am I not? Did you sleep well, Dino? To you. To your future. The old couples are surely the only true ones. What he says is true. He is right, Farou. The old couples are the only true ones. Do you think I have aged a bit? You know, with women, it comes and goes. Yeah. -From what she told me… -She talked to you? Vaguely. She needs solitude to find out who she is. Do you see the kind of bullshit? I know who she is. I should be enough for her… -Are you from there? -Yes, I am. So, how is he? Tired of mom's scolding, he fell asleep. Poor guy. He’d rather sleep than listen to her. You are making fun of her! It's good to be here, Mom. He is still her husband, damn it! -I did not get a call? -No, you did not. Maybe he forgot about you. Poor bitter guy. Paul, would you like some coffee? No, thanks, I'm not allowed. Since when are you not allowed to have coffee? It has been eight days. It's called an alert, what I got. An alert. Like during the war. I'm ageing, what can I say. Anyway, that is what the doctor told me. What else did he tell you? To avoid emotions. Hello? Yes, that is me. Good morning, doctor. And if the brain is not back in its place? I understand. Thank you. Goodbye, doctor. They will do his CT scan at 11 a.m. If the brain is back in place, he can leave the clinic immediately and go back home. What if the brain’s not back in its place? Don't you think we should talk to mom? Leave mom alone. We will see what happens. Do you want blueberry or redcurrant jam? Apricot. Of course. Since there is none. Well, then get dressed and go buy me some at the grocery store. I'm hungry! You have been bothering me all night! The other day Farou left just after he woke up. The kids are spoiling you too much. You are even more annoying than before! You do not realize, the operation I just had… With your whims, I truly realize that you got away with it. You are really unpleasant. And it took you 20 years to realize this? It's nice of you to be here, though. At what time is my CT? At 11 a.m. We have plenty of time. Do not worry. I cannot wait to get out of here. I miss my baby. Your luggage is ready. If the professor says that your scan is good, we will go right back home. Are you happy? What if it's not good? What do we do, Mom? Are you sure? Even if today's scan is not good, we wait a few days and leave? Yeah! Do not be afraid, Dad. It's over. Daddy! This is François. We are getting married, we just decided. Did you hear that, Jeanne? Juliette is getting married. You have a nice family, Mr. Séverin. She likes you. It's because of your bandage. It looks like Guillaume Apollinaire. SCANNER See you soon, Dad, do not do anything stupid. Juliette, my darling, you look ridiculous. You should get a haircut occasionally. What are you doing looking at me? Do you think her hair looks good? The brain is back in its place. All is well. -You hear that, Dad? -It's not your time yet. -You will have to shoot this one. -You saved him, doctor! We are leaving, right? Everything is ready. I'm happy! But take it easy, this trip I mean. And do not forget to call me back in eight days. You saved my life! Because it was savable. And be modest with that, do you hear? What a great guy! Do you think it will be okay, between you and Édouard? I do not know. He cannot do any more harm now. The time for passions is over. Then maybe you will grow old together. -Maybe. -Come on, Mom, take the wheel! -Be careful, this is no time to… -Hi, Paul. Hi, Dino. -Goodbye. -See you, kids. Your foot, Édouard. Have a nice trip, Mom! Goodbye! Take care? We were a little overwhelmed. But finally delivered. And perhaps we had grown. A construction site was waiting for me, which was to keep me away from France for months. I decided to leave that day. Our children are so sweet. Gorgeous. They are all gorgeous. Moumouche will be happy to see us again. But… -How are you driving? -You are not going to start now? And that same day, without telling anyone, Sidonie finally performed in public. Here, listen. What is it called, the song she plays? "Jésus que ma joie demeure". It's beautiful. It's very beautiful. -Shall we go? -No. We will wait for her. Jude! I did it! I did it, Jude! See, it was not that difficult. Silly girl. What did you do? What did you do, Mom? Well, I performed! That is why you are here, right? Yes. How was she? I would not be surprised if she glued a big promise to the Blessed Virgin to her shoulders in the hospital. Or to some other spiritual entities. With her, you never know. Maybe to God himself. Do you think we are done, you and I? We are never going to make love again? I do not know. I'm like you, Paul. I do not know. Well, if you think you could be happy… That is the most important. We have the same possibilities. No. Not me. I'm the man of a single love. And maybe that is also the case for me. Have you cheated on me? Tell me the truth, Dino. Maybe this will help me. -Tell me the truth. Did you cheat on me? -Yes, I did. Why? I do not know… In order to exist. Because I was miserable. Have you been in love with someone else? No. Did you enjoy it? Why? It was stupid. What if we made love before you left? In the end, you never know when is the last time. Interesting situation, do you think so? How do we know it's the last one? This is my flight. You are tough, right? And evil. I have no choice. I do not love you. I do not love you. Dino? Paul? Not to alarm you, but if we break down again, we are in trouble. Are you going to be okay? There are times when you look like a young girl. You have not changed, you… You still have the charm! Yes, I do. From my hospital bed, I could see you all coming in with the rhythm of the street. The smell of the street. And I was almost gone. I was on a boat that was headed out to sea. And I could not stop it. And you were on the shore. You were watching me drift away. Smaller and smaller. More and more unreachable. Sometimes, with a gesture or a smile, one of you came close again. And then, slowly, without making a sound, I would leave to join the others. It would leave. And I could not hold it back. When Dino called to inform me, it was night. Everyone was asleep in the house. I could hear the sound of the rain on the tiles. I was hanging on to that sound. All of a sudden, it was as if everything stopped. So I thought about your recovery. I have imagined today, coming home. And I got my strength back. I like you being so strong. That is convenient, right? It's strange to be here. With you. It's like a second life. The big gray dog. Come here, dog. Here you are. WELCOME, DAD We are feeling fine here. I almost forgot.
