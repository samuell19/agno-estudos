Men murder whores, women murder their babies. What does that make me? I picture the Mariana Trench going all the way down. I imagine the fishes trapped down in the ink. They don't know if it's day or night and they learn not to care. I spend a lot of time staring at this one little spot. The ceiling changes shape as the daylight shifts. I imagine I'm looking down on the world from the sun through a long telescope. And I can see it all there. Scraped, rough and random but somehow still white and clean. Except for this one spot. ♪ Where do you go when heaven calls you ♪ What do you do, who do you turn to ♪ How old will you be when they finally catch you ♪ Don't stop moving, they're right behind ya ♪ When there's no one left on this earth you know ♪ Who can save you kid, so just wake up wake up wake up ♪ What do we have here? A man's gold watch and a silk tie. Somebody leave these on your night stand? You really want me to make up a story? I just need to hear that this stuff isn't stolen. The guy who gave them to me will never come looking for them. Good enough. I'll give you $200 for the watch, the tie I don't need. But I told you, it's silk. It says made in Italy. People don't come here for their fuckin' formal wear needs. Do they come in here to stare at the lazy idiot, the one pathetic little man who's exactly where he's supposed to be? I'm sorry. I don't like you, you're unlikeable. But I need your money. I apologize. I'll give you $150 for the watch. Sweet dreams? You know, I was dreaming that I was asleep on the table. Like I had just closed my eyes but I could hear everything that's goin' on around me. Sounds boring. You ready to settle up? Um, no, not yet. Can I have more coffee, please. Somebody's got you working like a dog. Yeah, me. What are ya workin' on? It's a mystery. Well good luck, we close at two. So, I got the last of Dan's old notes today. I went through them point-by-point. Dan was a real professional, he did a great job. I don't know what you expected me to find. Yeah, I came to the exact same conclusion, the kid's dead, it sucks but, Listen, if you like wasting your money I can research this thing forever. Like this, uh, this girlfriend, Agnes Poelzl? Fine, fine I will contact you in two weeks when the next payment's due. Yes? Hi, I'm looking for Agnes Poelzl. Looking? It's hard to see anything through the phone. Hey, that's funny. Uh, are you Agnes? What if I am? I'm Alan Mulder with CNN Online, I'm looking into the disappearance of Pete Macur. I knew Pete. That's why I'm calling. I was wondering if I could interview you. I won't go on camera. No, no, no don't worry, I'm print only. I already told the police everything I know. And it was such a long time ago I probably forget everything anyway. I'd still really like to sit down with you for maybe an hour or so and go over some of the details. Um, I can come by your house, if that's okay. How do you know that I have a house? I've been researching you, Agnes. I see, okay. Cool, come by, I'll be home. Great, great. I should be by about one o'clock. Fine. John Aguto told me an interesting story about you and Pete. Oh yeah, how is Johnny? I found him driving a garbage truck in Chicago. Solid job. Yeah, anyway, he says you hit Pete with a lamp? It was at a party. I was really drunk and he was in a bad mood and he kept saying these sad, stupid things. So, I grabbed a floor lamp and swung it at him, as like a silly, exaggerated thing. But I connected and knocked him to the ground. Everyone paints a pretty clear picture of a severely depressed kid. He was very depressed. Just sad all the time. Any reason for that? Any trauma, abuse, anything like that? No, I don't think so. It was just his way, since he was little. Some people are like that. Do you want some coffee? Oh man, I'd kill for some. You're all business. Sorry. When was the last time you took a break? Um, when I could afford one. Uh, last year I went to Costa Rica for two weeks. What was that like? Hot. Was it that bad? Um, no, no it wasn't, it was great. I just have kind of an active mind, I need stuff. I kind of feel like a shark sometimes, you know, in that I need to keep swimming, not that I'm going around eating people. I think I know what you mean. Listen, this might be, um, a little out of bounds, but are you seeing anybody? Not really. How about seeing me? I'm seeing you right now, Alan. You're not really from CNN, are you? No, and, uh, my name's not Alan, it's Mike. The Macur family they've hired me to look into their case. People usually stay on the phone for CNN. A slick private detective right here in my living room. Do you drink straight bourbon while you polish your .45? Yeah, yeah and, uh, beautiful dames are always comin' to me under false pretenses. You, uh, have authorization to carry, right? Come on, let me see it. I don't carry a gun. Really? A taser, mace? No, no I'm-I'm a researcher, I'm not really a bail bondsman. Well you're no fun at all. No, I'm lots of fun. Good. I guess it's not much of a first date, me interviewing you about your dead friend. What makes you think he's dead? It's not exactly rocket science. A painfully average kid, no special prospects, obviously depressed as shit, goes missing one day and then 10 years without a peep to anybody. I'm sorry I know he was your friend I just, he went in the woods one day and then, you know? Yeah, uh, I guess it was obvious. What are you going to tell Pete's parents? Well I told them he's dead. They should be spending their money on a grief Counsellor. The world is tough. Yeah it is. Some of these are pretty cool. They were my dad's, he had a plan for each one of them. You ever think about fixing them up? They'll be worth some money. No, there's too many of them and they were his. I like to finish what I start. I bump into the shelves and they start all falling down like dominoes. I don't know how the hell they cleaned that all up. Ah, hm. You think I'm into you. I would say my chances are pretty good. You're brave. I am, and lonely. And dumb. So dumb. Get on the floor. What just happened? Lay down on your stomach, with your hands behind you and your fingers and thumbs outstretched. No. If you don't, I'm gonna shoot you in the belly and show you your guts. Whoa, whoa, whoa, uh- What did you do to me? You need to let me go. I've got, got money. Shut up! - No, no, no, no. - No, no no! Stop, stop! Goddamnit, my hands are fuckin' shaking. I haven't been this angry in a million fuckin' years! I'm about to burn down this whole house for this thing. Why do you bother me so much? You need to let me go. Pete Macur was not some loser. And for you to come into my home and talk about him like he was a colony of bed bugs, like he was maggots on old Chinese food. I know. I'm an asshole, I-I-I know. No, you don't get it, yet. I was 16, I didn't know anything. Life's a blur when you're a kid. But Pete was in focus. He was a year older than me, he wore all black. I thought he was so cool because he was free. Teachers would give him work to do and he'd tell them to fuck off. It took a long time to figure out he wasn't cool, he was just hurting all the time. But nothing ever happened to him, it's just the way he was, he was just one of those people who's sensitive to the noise. He wrote me a letter about wanting to die. I still have it, it was poetry. Okay. Actually, this is- this is shit, he was just a teenager. But the point is that he had a need and I had a need and God put us together. I helped him, like this, right here. In the end he didn't want to fuck. I don't think he was gay, he was just scared. Everything got very complicated for him, especially when he started to choke. It was all there in his face. But for me, things became simple, I met myself. Is there any way that- I can survive this? Or at least to wash off the gas? No. But I'm not gonna hang you. That was my favour to Pete and that is way too good for you. I never feel sorry for the people that I hurt, because I always hurt the right people. There are a million reasons for me to kill you and only a handful of reasons why I should let you live. The world isn't fair, it's not evenhanded. If it was, we'd all be gods. And then they held me down and they put a gun to my head. My mother was brought into the room and they, I don't know how you say, they put an alive rat into her. They made me watch. And then they said if I ever attended a demonstration again, they would kill her. Those are very powerful images, any feedback? How did that make you feel? I can't describe it, I was gone inside. In this fallen world we live in, the monsters can make you want to work for them. They can steal your soul. But you kept fighting the government, right? Yes. What would've stopped you? When they have you, they seem like God. But they could not watch me all of the time, so as soon as I was free, I knew what I had to do. Too many people are just evil. Yeah, what do you think about that? Were those soldiers just doing their job? Most of them. There was one man, he was very short with scars all over his face. I think everybody was scared of him. That guy, did he seem to get depressed after he was done torturing you? I don't know. He was very cruel, but I don't think he enjoyed making pain. So you think he was better at his job, or maybe the friendlier guys got into your head more. You know, Amanda, your note taking is really distracting. It helps me. Okay, but from your questions it seems that you're still detached from the rest of us. Why don't you share your story to the group? There isn't much to say. Say it anyways. There were these two guys, friends of mine, they wanted to party, but I didn't want to, but they didn't want to take no for an answer. So, they took me up to a cottage for a few days and they beat me up, and they fucked me. You mean they raped you. Yeah. But they let me go. I mean, it sucks, but what're you gonna do? You have a long emotional journey ahead of you, Amanda. But you just took the first step, and that's admirable. That's why I'm here. Hey, has anyone ever been electrocuted? I hear it's really, really bad. I can't sleep in these cuffs. You're not supposed to. You need to feed me, I'm dying. You're right. But a man your size can go about a month without food. You do need water, or you die too quick, here. You are a bad man and look what it's done to you. Now you're nothing. No freedom, no food, no hope, no name. My name is Michael Mercer. And I have a business partner out there that will be looking for me. They're not going to find you. And your name isn't Mike anymore. Do you understand, or do I have to beat you until you understand? No. I am a person, I have a name. That means I get food. Celery isn't much of a food, really. It's negative calories. It won't keep you going, but it does fill you up. No, not interested? Okay, this? Processed cheese. It's off brand too, fake shit. It's a funny colour. But I bet after days without food it starts to look pretty damn good. What do you say I give you some celery and some cheese? Yes, please. But there's a problem. This stuff, it isn't food. It's nameless, empty shit, just like you. I can't give you that. And as for all this other food, the celery and stuff, well that's, that's for me. That's for Agnes. Remember, my name is Agnes, and you are? Mike. Nope. I know what you're thinking. She's gonna kill this guy. No, it's not like that. There's sex, which is violence, and there's love, which is also violent in a different way. I deserve to be adored, even if only by this dickless loser. Andie? You must be Chris. Yeah that's me, I guess. How are you? It's so funny, we've talked so much online and now I don't know what to say. Uh, I'm glad I got to finally meet you in person, and see you in person. The eyes are supposed to be the windows to the soul yours say smart. Smart is what counts in this world. So tell me something about yourself I don't already know. I don't know. I was born in the city, my dad drove truck. Mom left and took my little brother. We moved to a house in the country after that. It must've been tough losing all of your friends. I didn't lose any friends. My house was the shit. I used to throw awesome parties every weekend. We built the track for dirt bikes, guys would let me ride their snow machines in the winter. But you didn't have a mom? I didn't have wings either, doesn't mean I missed them. I'm not sure I get you. There's nothing to get. Loneliness is when I close my eyes. Then when I open them there are too many people, so many that nobody notices some of them. Some are left to trickle through sewer grating to the bottom of the bottom. You'll never find me down there. You'll never see me floating above death on a layer of rancid fat. I could shoot you in the face right now and nobody would know. Your partner hasn't called. The police aren't coming. You're trapped, alone and worthless. What do you want? I want you to ask me to shoot you. Say, I'm a bad man and I want to die. I'm not gonna do that. Why not? Because you'll shoot me. You're right but, you're going to ask me anyway. It's only a matter of time. I not gonna give you the satisfaction. Listening to you beg for death does nothing for me. Killing you does. Wiping an insect like you off the face of this Earth satisfies the shit out of me. Then just do it. I'm gonna starve anyway. I can't do this. Just- just shoot me, already. Stab yourself. What? Prove to me you wanna die and this can all be over. You wanna see where that goes, I do. Make your move. Oh God. Alright. Here it comes. Oops. Guess we have to try again tomorrow. People say you shouldn't enjoy someone else's pain. They say that pain is too easy. Pleasure is more rewarding to create. That may be true of spreading rumours or watching old ladies slip on banana peels, but they don't know how big pain gets. How beautiful it gets. When you take a human life, you become God, just for an instant. But if you take a human mind, you own a soul. Then you are God. You didn't finish your food. I thought I had more time. But you don't. No. Is it hard to finish a plate of food? Is that something that you can't accomplish? I don't-I don't know what happened, I was eating. Well you know what you have to do. God, I'm just so stupid. Where should I stab myself this time? Uh, it's your punishment. We do this again and again, and you never learn anything. How were you getting by? Not good. Things were pretty bad. There's a person, a man, who can handle this. He can endure all of this, and then survive it, and then go out into the world and do whatever he wants. Do you wanna be that person? Yeah, of course. Well then why hasn't it happened yet? Because it- It's alright. We can figure this out together. If that's what you really want. Yeah. It's going to be very hard. Yeah. Okay, I'll try for you. We're in this together. Go set the table. It didn't turn out great. I think I left the heat on too high. If you clean your plate there's a handjob in it for you. You don't have to do that. I want to. I want to make you feel good because only I can make you feel good. Right. Contentment is better than happiness. Contentment is warm and filling, and can go on forever. Happiness is wild and out of control. Happiness is stupid. You know, I wish I'd kept up with my vegetable garden. Everything tastes so much better fresh. I mean, even a potato. My mom used to grow peas out on our balcony, and I-I never really cared about that until she switched over to snap peas, because snap peas you can eat the whole pod and I- and I thought that was cool. Do you even think before you talk? That has to be the most boring thing I have ever heard. Why would you even open your mouth to say something so stupid? We're trying to have a nice dinner here. I'm sorry. You know, there's a barrel out in the barn and it's about your size. And I don't wanna have to use it, but sometimes you really make me think about it. What would you like to talk about? I don't know, just shut up. In the basement, now. Hi, might you be Miss Pezzle? Poelzl, it sounds a bit like puzzle. So you're Agnes? Yes, how can I help you? I'm looking for a missing person. Do you know a man named Mike Mercer? It doesn't ring a bell. He may have presented you with an alias. Mark Ellis or Alan Mulder? Oh yeah, Alan. I met with him maybe six weeks ago. Did he lie about his name? Is he some sort of criminal? No, no, he's uh, was a private investigator. Uh, so he was here? Yeah. Okay, well that squares with the phone records. What were you talking about? Oh, he was working on an old story. He just wanted to ask a couple of questions. Do you remember when he left? Uh, early. It was about three, I think. You're sure? Yeah, it was about three. Uh, Mr. Mercer has a reputation for being quite a drinker and hanging around in the low social circles. Um, don't take it personally, but are you a prostitute? Please leave. I'm sorry. If you could take my card, please, um, and have a good day. If, uh, you think of anything, any information, please give me a call? Sure. You're a drunk? Lay off! Oh yeah? You gonna hit me? You drunken piece of shit? Turn over! Turn over on your side get these down, I'm gonna shove this right up your ass. It won't fit! Jesus Christ what am I gonna do with you? They say love is seeing all of someone's faults and needing them anyway. I guess I'm short on love. I never kept pets very long. They always shit on the floor or something and then their insides became more interesting than their outsides. Maybe people are different, I have my doubts. Yes? Hi, Andie? Huh? It's me, Chris. Oh, Chris, hey. So, how have you been? It's been a few months, you haven't called. Yeah, I didn't know where we stood. You said you were gonna call me. I didn't want to look, you know, desperate. Well if you liked me, you would've called. Well, I do like you and I am calling. Hm, I don't like cowardice. I'm not a coward, I'm just shy. You're pretty intense. Can we start over? I'm busy right now, I'll call you back. Okay. Who was that? I don't know, who cares? It's been ages since I had some fun and man am I ready for it. Time to make trouble on a school night. I'm gonna make this clown buy me every shot in the bar and then eat my pussy until I don't remember my name, which to him is Andie. Andie, Andrea Koo- Andrea Martina Kubichevski. Wait. Coffee? Vodka. No, the room's already spinning. I don't know how you can put 'em back like that. Muscle burns alcohol and I love being wasted. Okay, the one coffee and one vodka then. Didn't like that one? No. You're crazy. Yup. So what're you into? I don't know, normal stuff I guess. You ever choke a girl? No, I'm not into that. Oh come on, a computer guy like you? You must watch some nasty porn. I'm just a normal guy. What, normal guys can't watch porn? They can't fantasize about fucking dirty sluts up the ass two at a time? Uh, I like that you're forward, it's, uh, sexy. But do we need to talk about this? Oh, you're so shy! How very darling. First, I am going to finish my drink. And then I'm going to corrupt the shit out of you. Yes, ma'am. So I'm at the club, right? And this song comes on, from like the 90's or whatever, it's like this happy, cheesy shit. And this guy he wants to grind on me to this dumb song and I was like, hey, you are way too fucking ugly. And he can't hear what I'm saying and he- What? What, I- I can't go out and have a good time? I didn't say anything. Just please continue your story. You think that you own me, huh? I'm not your fucking wife! I don't know what you're talking about. No matter how good I am to you, you just-you just never change, do you? Listen, listen, I just- I want to be unchained, that's all. The pot is starting to smell. Fuck you, you're a selfish prick! The world spins like a top, but instead of being thrown away we're pulled in tighter to its flow. Nothing makes any sense. All we have is our drives. I know what I want when I want it. And anything else is a lie. I'm so tired of your ugly fucking face. You broken robot bastard. Put your head on the block. Ugh, go inside. Hey. Come here. I'm still wet. I like the way the soap smells. How are you doing? I don't know what to say to that. I've been cruel to you recently, and you deserve it. But I'm a good person. So we're going to do something just for you today. Something special. What are we doing? It's a surprise. Ever find yourself thinking two different thoughts at the same time for days and days and then one minute they just slam together like two powerful magnets that have just been flipped over? It makes you go all tingly. Chris, hey. Andie? What are you doing here? I miss you, I wanna hang out. Uh- Well I only have a half hour for lunch. Why don't I take you out to dinner at five? Chris, come back to my place, I need to fuck. That sounds awesome, but it's not gonna work. You're coming with me or we're breaking up. Were we together? Don't be retarded. You can choose to either sit in front of a computer for a company that hates you, or you can come and have the best damn sex of your life. Alright. This is Chris, he's probably gonna be out for the night, but when he wakes up we're gonna have some fun with him. What, Agnes, I don't- I don't want this. He's coming to. Chris? Chris, Chris! Is this your only cellphone? What's going on? You tech guys sometimes carry a second phone or maybe one of those palm things? What? What is this, some kind of sex game? Could be, now answer my questions. Is this your only communication device? Yeah, now please let me go. I-I'm not into this. Next question, what's the password to your email? I'm not telling you that. Yes you are. God, oh shit! Stop, I'm not into this, I'm not into this, stop! Tell me the password to your email or I will stick hot pins underneath your fingernails. It's catnip, all lowercase. Alright, next question, what's the password to your dating profile? It's cat-catnip1. Yeah I'm in, I'll delete the profile. Good job. Now, why don't you tell my friend here a little story. Tell him the story of us. I don't like this, I just want to go home. Tell him the story, Chris. Uh, we met online, online dating. We went out on a couple of dates and, and uh, we didn't see each other for a while. No, you didn't call for two months. That is not nice, Christopher. Then I called you and you said you wanted to go out again. Yeah and then we went out, just last week. And then we went back to your place. And then what happened? We had sex. That's right. Did you hear that? Chris here fucked me while you were sharing my bed. I'm sorry, man, I-I didn't know. What are we gonna do? What do you want to do? We could cut off the dick that he fucked me with? Or- maybe you could fuck him. I don't want to hurt anybody, but I don't think we could just let him go. Let him go? Stop please don't kill me, please don't kill me! Shut up or I will pop your fuckin' testicles! I don't believe this! This-this guy fucked me and you don't give a damn! What is wrong with you? Just kill him, because that is what you want to do. Sorry for everything. Me too. Please help me. You seem like a decent guy. Or at least someone who, I don't know. Oh shit! What is that? A needle, you're going stick him with it. Oh fuck no! Shut up. What's in it? Rat poison, mostly. Jesus. Shut up. You do it. You don't understand. I'll stroke it for you while he goes. It'll be good. I am not like you. Fine. But you are going to inject him with that needle or I'm gonna shoot both of you silly fucks. No, man, no jab her. Jab her instead, come on, man. Wanna fuck? God is awesome, God is a cool guy. And the more I act like him, the more he loves me. The more I exercise my omnipotence, the more he showers me with favour. I consume the worship of my believers like a fire breathes air. Mice were made for cats and this world was made for me. Was that your first time? Yes. You're telling me you never had to kill anyone for your job? No. You feel bad, don't you? Of course. I wish I did, that'd be intense. No, you don't, it hurts. It hurts because you're weak. I know how to turn my feelings strong. You get to invent your feelings. No one normal has that luxury. You need to go outside and start digging. I'm not fucking around. Go take the pickaxe from the shed and break ground behind the barn. I will get to it. Now. How much liquour did you order? The authorities have identified the victim as this man, computer science lecturer Christopher Thomas. Thomas was spotted in the parking lot of Allaway Learning Centre speaking to an unidentified person in a white pickup truck. Thomas' family has released the following statement. Hey. Is this deep enough? Not even close. I hit a fuckin' rock. Well that's a stupid place to dig. Seriously? Is it true that the cops stop looking for a missing person after two weeks? Where did you hear that? No, it's nonsense. Yeah. Well have you ever heard of them issuing something like an Amber Alert for a man before? What? Oh my god, Agnes. You didn't just pull Chris off the street in broad fuckin' daylight, did you? No, because I'm not an idiot! Well, somebody obviously saw you and now they think he's kidnapped! Fuck you! I wasn't thinking clearly, okay? It's so easy for you! You sit around here all day having everything done for you! I don't kill people! He's alive and they're looking for him? Yeah. You're fucked. It's good that he's alive. It means that we don't have to deal with the decomp until we want to. I can hold down the fort here, you have a new job. I don't even want to have to think about this thing. Chris here is your responsibility now. He eats your food, drinks your water, sleeps in your bed. If he dies, you die. Agnes, you're being crazy right now. I don't care. Clean him up, put some food in him. Fuck. Jesus Christ you stink so fuckin' much. This is gross. Jesus fucking Christ! Soap, go nuts. Ugh. Are you fucking with me? So you're-you're paralyzed, right? You can't feel anything, is that right? So why the fuck is your fucking dick hard? Whatcha got there? I caught a frog, but it got away. I like catching things. I do too. When people use the word life to describe their everyday experience, they're talking about what road they drove to work, what they ate for dinner, what they watched on TV. There are only a few of us who deserve the right to make our own lives. And it all works out because we're the only ones who even try. The rest of you just walk around in circles like ants following scent trails. Whoa. Now you are a sub. Excuse me? That's awesome, my husband and I make our own gear. Damn, I, I think I have a card here somewhere. Thanks. We mostly do corsets, but Brian is a genius with leather. He can do anything. And we use quality material, so there's no way your daddy can break this stuff. Great. Courtney, by the way. What's your name? I don't have one. Cool. I forget, are you supposed to rinse the pasta? No, no no, you don't rinse pasta 'cause the starch in the pasta is what the sauce sticks to. And you're supposed to stir it in with the pasta, you don't just dump it on top. Makes sense. There you go. Spoon, please. Boon peeez? Fucking retard. Well he's not retarded, it's his mouth. Oh yeah? Say grace. I'm serious, stop eating. Say grace, now, or I will hurt you. You know she'll do it. Come on, let's hear it. Bless us, Lord. Bwess us Lord. Bless this food. Bwess dis food. Please forgive us. - Yeah, I'm a fucking retard! Oh, come on, where you going? Come on, sit down. Eat your dinner. Help me. No. Look what she's done to me. Compared to what I went through, you're at the Four fucking Seasons. I don't want to die. I'm fucked up, but I don't want to die. It doesn't look good, but it's out of my hands. Right now, she's gone. And that truck runs. It's not that simple. It is. Unless you're as bad as her, it is. I can't just- The time's not right. Yeah? Yeah, so go fix it. I'm busy. Seriously? Yeah, his nails are awful, I think he's got an infection. Who fucking cares? - Fuck! You stay away from him until you're thinking straight! I'll fucking kill him. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm getting a blow torch. Wait, wait, just fucking wait, hey! Stop, stop. - What? It's not time to kill him yet. That's what you're thinking about right now? Were you not there five seconds ago? Did you not see what you just did? I'm sorry! You try to let someone in and this is exactly what always happens. People are impossible. You, even you should be able to see how fucked up our life is. Now I can't be expected to remain calm in a situation like that. I'm calm. You're you. I can't do this forever. Someday either I'm dead or you're dead. It's not today, so just relax. Oh shit. I called the police. Chris, it's- it's me. It's Mike, I'm your-I'm your buddy. Buddy? You poisoned me. You can let me go. 'Cause the-'cause the cops, the cops are coming, they're gonna get me, and you can let me go. No, you'll play the victim. I can't let that can't happen. Chris, you're the good guy. You're the good guy and you don't shoot, you don't shoot unarmed human beings. You are not a human being! Finish him, he might survive that. Yup. Should we burn the place? No time. Now are we sure this is gonna work 'cause they're looking for me too. I don't know, just drive east and stay under the speed limit. Okay. Fear is a choice. Okay, I'm opening the trunk. Please be alive and please don't shoot me! Yeah, I can hear you. I'm going to the bathroom. Gas up and don't do anything stupid, there are cameras. Can I get you anything? Yeah, just get me a drink. Hey, man. Hey. You look just like that guy on TV. Who? That guy from that serial killer case. My life's not that interesting, insurance sales. Yeah, you look just like him then. You sure you're okay? I'm good. All right. Human need and human weakness- See that dude right there- Are two very different things that often look the same. You have a need for food. When you eat, it makes you strong and when you're hungry it makes you strong. But there comes a point when you finally just starve. Even if you don't fear it, it takes you. You find your bottom. You don't move, you get away from the window now. What do you want, man? You got a silent alarm, you got a crash button? What? No. What the fuck? That fucking guy ID'd me. It's okay. It's okay. Did they get a call out? No, I was quick. Well? Well, what? Well what do we do? Three witnesses, one gun, you do the math. Okay, we didn't see anything, man. Oh, don't be such a child. Give me my gun. Give me my fucking gun! When you bungee jump, there comes a point at the end when you're left hanging there. You're just limp and bored as they lower you to the ground. I'm the detective in charge of the case. Do you know why you're here? Girl talk? Well so far we have got armed robbery, and now we're adding murder to the list. Are all the other detectives busy right now? No doubt it's going to grow. And I just heard that Christopher Thomas died in hospital. Who? I'm sure you'll remember. I'm sure you'll remember when I tell you that your boyfriend gave you up. Oh, you must have me mistaken, because I don't have a boyfriend. I don't think so. He apparently, uh, didn't do very well. Tried to kill himself and now he's in a mental hospital. And he'll probably get off, with no charges, unlike yourself. Is this some kind of joke? Are the real detectives waiting outside? You don't want to talk to me about what happened? Because I know your boyfriend will. Really? You have no emotion in your eyes, you're dead. Why don't you try to convince me there's somebody else in there? Is this the tactic you're taking? Coldblooded killer, that's all I see. You are boring me. I'm not leavin', you got me. We're done here, bye-bye. We going to play this game? Talk to me Agnes. Tell me what happened. Jail time. Yo, Mike, pill time. No. Come on, man, it'll make you feel better. I have the right to decide what goes into my body. Alright, I tried. I wanna get some fresh air. I don't think so. Everybody else gets a smoke break. Five minutes, but we gotta go right now. Sure. Well, I'm gonna go for a smoke, so I gotta go over there. But I can still see you, okay? You know what, I'm just gonna take a quick lap. What, I can't see you through a building. Pull over, I need to vomit. You're pretty, but not that pretty. I get car sick, I'm seriously going to puke. Puke away, cupcake, I don't mind one bit. Stop talking to my prisoner. Back on the plains of Africa, you needed me. I'm not crazy, I just realize how the world really works. The way you people prostrate yourselves to whatever society asks you would think that the world would see a person like me, and open up and swallow me whole. But it hasn't, has it? God looks down on me and he doesn't care. He knows I have good reasons for what I do, he doesn't mind. Just think for a second. You're about to take the greatest person you're ever gonna meet to prison and I'm gonna be in chains for the rest of my life, for what? James? James? I might wear a veil of dead skin to pass freely in a sea of corpses, but I am not dead. I am here, watching. And I will always be among you.
