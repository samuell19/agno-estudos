THANK YOU. THANK YOU. IT'S A GREAT PLEASURE TO HAVE MY FIRST SHOW HERE AT STRATUS GALLERY, 'CAUSE I THINK THAT ART SHOULD BE PROVOCATIVE, I THINK THAT IT SHOULD STIR THE EMOTIONS, AND LAST, BUT NOT LEAST, I THINK IT SHOULD ALWAYS BE EXPENSIVE.

WHAT'D YOU DO WITH THE ICE PICK? KEEP IT. YOU LISTEN, THAT CREEP HAS BEEN HARASSING ME HERE, AND AT MY HOUSE, AND NOW HE'S GOT YOU DOING THE SAME DAMN THING, AND I'M SICK OF IT. SO, LEAVE ME THE HELL ALONE. CASSANDRA IS ONE OF MY MOST RESPONSIBLE EMPLOYEES. YOU CAN VERIFY THAT WITH THE OFFICE MANAGER ON YOUR WAY OUT. SWELL. WHAT'S WITH THE DOLL? IT'S MY TENSION RELIEVER. WHAT CAN WE DO FOR HER? IT'S TOO LATE. THIS WOMAN IS TOO POWERFUL. DETECTIVE BURNS, PLEASE? ( indistinct ) WHO IS IT? HOLD IT, HOLD IT. THIS IS BURNS. SO, WHAT HAPPENED? DID YOU ARREST HER? I DON'T HAVE ANY EVIDENCE AGAINST HER. PEOPLE ARE DEAD. CAN YOU SEARCH HER HOUSE? DO SOMETHING. YEAH, ARE YOU HOME? WE NEED TO TALK. YEAH, I'M AT HOME. GO GET HIM. WE GOT TO GET OUT OF HER. NOW, COME ON, ARNA. YOU'VE GOT TO THINK. WHAT CAN WE DO TO STOP HER? YOU CAN'T HIDE FROM HER. WHAT WOULD YOUR BROTHER DO? MY BROTHER WOULDN'T GO AGAINST HER. HE ALREADY DID. HE'S DEAD BECAUSE OF HER. NOW LOOK, I'M GOING TO STOP HER, WITH OR WITHOUT YOUR HELP. I CAN'T JUST SIT AROUND HERE AND DO NOTHING. IT'S MY FAULT. BUT, IF I TELL YOU. YOU'LL BE KILLED, TOO. TELL ME WHAT TO DO. SHE'S USING SOMETHING PERSONAL OF DIANE'S. FIND IT, CLEAN IT IN PURE ALCOHOL. ONCE IT IS CLEAN, BURN IT WITH SOMETHING OF HERS, LIKE HAIR FROM HER BRUSH. PLACE THE ASHES IN FRONT OF HER DOOR. SHE'LL UNDERSTAND. THANK YOU. I'M GOING WITH YOU. I'LL GO AROUND BACK. NO. DAMN IT, DIANE. STAY IN THE CAR. HE WASN'T THERE. HE WASN'T AT HIS HOUSE. I KNOW WHERE HE IS. I'LL SEND BACK-UP. OK, LET'S GO. YOU STAY HERE. THAT'S ALL RIGHT, KID. THAT'S OK. UNBELIEVABLE. IT WORKS. ( grunts ) ( gasps ) ( door creaking ) AAH! BRAD! AAH! NO! ( grunting ) NO! UH! WHAT'D I DO? WHAT'D I DO? I DIDN'T MEAN TO DO IT. I DIDN'T MEAN TO DO IT. I DIDN'T MEAN TO DO IT, I DIDN'T MEAN TO DO IT. I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO. IT'S OK. IT'S OK. YOU'VE BEEN SHOT, YOU'VE BEEN SHOT. NO, NO, NO. IT'S ALL RIGHT. IT'S ALL RIGHT. SHH. SHH. ( sirens ) I DON'T UNDERSTAND. WHY DID SHE DO THIS? IT'S OVER. I HOPE YOU GOT A GOOD LAWYER. LAWYER? LOOKS TO ME LIKE BREAKING AND ENTERING. LOOKS TO ME LIKE PREMEDITATED MURDER. SHE SHOT HIM. DIANE JUST SAVED MY LIFE. I KNOW SOMEONE WHO CAN HELP US. WELL, AFTER ALL THAT POLICE NONSENSE, WELCOME TO THE FAMILY, BRAD. IT'S A GREAT PLEASURE FINALLY MEETING DIANE'S FAMILY. OH, NO. THE PLEASURE IS OURS, ESPECIALLY MINE. NOT MANY MOTHERS CAN SAY THEIR SON-IN-LAW RISKED HIS LIFE TO SAVE THEIR DAUGHTER. YOU'RE A BRAVE MAN. OH, NO NO. NO ONE WAS BRAVER THAN DIANE. SHE WAS RIGHT THERE WITH ME THE WHOLE TIME. ( doorbell rings ) OH, THAT MUST BE HER. EXCUSE ME. GRANDMA. COME ON, I WANT YOU TO MEET BRAD. FOUR DEATHS. LET'S HOPE HE'S WORTH IT. EVERYTHING HAS ITS PRICE, GRANDMA.
