Not tonight he won't. Not if I can help it. [ Lady singing ] Ow! Help .. help! Do you think she'd know me? I had to hit her Walshie or she wouldn't leave go. I don't like hitting 'em, Walshie. - Ah, shut up. Give me that bag. How much is there? - Twenty-five bob. We'll go 50/50. Here you are. Fifteen bob for me, ten bob for you. - Thanks a lot, Walshie. Cor, she didn't half scream, didn't she. - Ah, the silly old cow. That copper must have been just round by the pub. - So what? Come on, let's get out of here. Here. You take this. I don't want it. Alright, alright. What are you scared about? I ain't scared only I wish you'd do the coshing sometimes, Walshie. Now listen. I do the planning and you do the coshing and we go 50/50. That's fair, isn't it? Yes, sure Walshie. - Alright then. Now shut up. Okay. Now remember, if your mum asks we stayed to see the big picture round again. Okay. You got it all sewed up, ain't you, Walshie. I know the game. I bet them coppers ain't half in a state, eh. Coppers? A bit of brain. That's all you need. Fool the coppers any day. Come on. Now just a minute you two. Where have you boys come from? Been to the pictures. Any objection? Recognise them, constable? I wouldn't swear to it sir, but I'm fairly certain. What time did you leave the cinema? I don't know. What time was it, Walshie? About ten minutes ago. No we're off home. Come on, Alfie. - Oh no you don't. Let go of me you dirty .. - Heh, what's this? Alright. Put them in the car. My mum says I've got to be home by ten. No. No, let go of me. I ain't done nothing wrong. - Come on. - Let go! You realize don't you Mrs Walsh just how serious this matter is? Happily, the victim of the assault was not gravely injured. But that was more by fortune than design. Well, what have you to say to me? It's evident. The Inspector says that the boy is mixed up in it. Mrs Walsh. I can't hear a word you are saying. I'm sorry, sir. I'm not used to .. I've never been. I suppose you .. Really want to tell me that your son is a good boy? Yes, sir. He'll have never done a thing like this. Not by himself. I just know he wouldn't. You heard what Wimbush said about him. - Oh yes. His employer gives him a good character. His mother stands up for him. He's not known to the police. A good boy, in fact. Until now. Is that it? - Yes, sir. And who do you suggest has let him stray? Collins? Is he the ringleader? I don't know, sir. I don't want to. According to Mrs Collins, her boy has been led astray too. I never meant you to think sir that I was .. Quite, Mrs Collins. You weren't trying to put the blame on Walsh, were you? No, sir. I'd never do a thing like that. I'm quite sure you wouldn't. Very well. Have you anything to say, Collins? It's all been a terrible mistake. And you, Walsh? All I can say is sir, that .. I am very, very sorry and it will never happen again. Very well. Is Mr Easter in court? Yes, sir. These two boys are first offenders it appears. At least it's the first time they've been found out. I've no doubt in my mind that one is the ringleader and deserves more punishment. I have my own idea as to which of them it is. But failing more sure evidence, I must give them both the benefit of the doubt. Are you willing to be put on probation, Collins? Yes, sir. - You, Walsh? Yes, sir. Very well. I shall put them on probation to you for one year, Mr Easter. Very well, sir. Next case. It was nice of you to speak up for Roy Mr Wimbush. That's alright. - Ha! I'm glad Alfie got off too. No thanks to you. I didn't say anything .. - Oh no, you didn't say anything. No. "My boy wouldn't hurt a fly". "Somebody must have put him up to it." "My Roy's a little angel." Like hell he is. Now half a minute. - You shut your gob. A fine pair you two are. Your kid goes around bashing old women. - That's not true. Oh isn't it? Well go back and ask the beak who he thought done it. You go and ask. - I don't need to. I'm quite sure Roy .. Don't say it. Don't say it. Now now, Mrs Collins. That will do. Off you go now and take Alfie home. I've had a talk with him and Roy and see they understand what's expected of them. I hope so anyway. I can look after Alfie. I don't need your help. The sooner you start the better. Thank you for nothing. Come on, Alfie. Get along home - Goodbye, Alfie. What about Roy? He's coming back to the garage with me. Really? That's splendid. I've told him and Collins I'm arranging for them to join the local youth centre. Give them somewhere to go in the evenings. I'm sure Roy would like that. Well, It's worth trying anyway. Go along, Roy. Yes, sir. Goodbye, Mum - Goodbye, dear. And thanks for sticking up for me in there. It won't happen again, I promise you. Okay, son? And thank you, Mr Wimbush. Come on then. Well, I shall be coming to see Roy of course from time to time. You'll be very welcome, sir. But you must do your part, Mrs Walsh. Don't be too easy with him. Keep a firm hand. He needs it. I'll try. You're off to work now, are you? I work at the Modern Caf?. I said I'd be there in time for luncheon. Yes. Well, goodbye then. Goodbye. And thank you. That's the boy. That's right. Hold him down. Jim, don't let him get you. Hello, Walshie. - Hello. Yeah, Alfie has just been telling us. Mucked up things proper, ain't it. A year. Cor .. Three times a week at the youth centre, eh Walshie? Knitting bed-socks for auntie? Here, watch out old Easter don't cop you. You got to be a good boy now, you know. - Yeah, that's what he thinks. My mum says he's worse than a copper. She reckons .. Stop about your mum. If she kept her mouth shut .. And what about yours? Who told the police ..? Well shut up about both of them. Who's the boss around here anyway? - It will be difficult for you, Walshie. Now listen. I'm running this gang. I always was and I'm always going to. Anybody who doesn't like it that way gets that around their kisser, see. Alright Walshie, keep your hair on. Yeah, but we can't do no jobs can we? What about old Easter? Think I can't fool that old coot? I had him and Wimbush and the old woman sobbing their hearts out this morning. I wish I could have done that with my mum. Why, what did she do? Just gave me a sock on the jaw and went off to the local. What to do, Walshie? What are we going to do? We don't do nothing. Not for a couple of months. By then you'll all be coming to the youth centre. Eh? What, us? But why, Walshie? Alibis. That's why. We'll do the jobs from there and alibi each other. I've got it all worked out. Here, copper coming. Okay, split up. I'm off home. - Cheerio, Walshie. Gran, you'll ruin your eyes. Roy is late. I hope he's alright. Of course he's alright. Don't fuss, girl. Mr Wimbush was so kind to him this morning. He's had too much kindness. That's half his trouble. - He's not looking well, Gran. You don't think the garage is too much for him do you? They don't know what work is these days. Eight hours a day, five days a week. It makes me laugh. - He's only a boy really. You can't expect him to take life seriously at his age. My boys started taking life seriously at 14. And that includes your Dave. It didn't do them no harm. If only .. - Now then. None of that. You only lost one. I lost all four. It won't do no good to brood on it. I can tell you that. No it won't, will it. Hello, Roy dear. Gran told me all about it. I'm so glad you got off. Trust you. - Yeah. He had a bit of trouble. - Oh, I'm sorry. Roy. I want you to meet a very dear friend of mine. Mister ..? What's your name, ducks? Uh .. Smith. - Of course. Silly of me. I never can remember names. Well .. Give my love to your mum, dear. Yeah. Here he is. Hi, Mum. - Hello dear. Is everything alright? - Yeah. I feel dead tired though. Well, your supper is all ready. I've got some good news for you. Mr Easter has been here. Oh? What did he want? He's fixed it all up for you to join the Youth Centre. Well, I suppose I'll have to go. There's gratitude for you. - Roy, it will be nice. He's been telling us all about it, hasn't he Gran. They have people come to give lectures. - Yeah? They have games as well of course. - Yeah, tiddlywinks and blow-football. They have concerts too and dances. Dances? - Once a month. All the boys take their girls. Dances, eh? And what sort of dames go there? I bet it ain't like the Palidrome. I didn't know you went to the Palidrome. - Didn't you? Well I have. Any objection? No dear. Of course not. It's just that. Well I thought I might have heard about it. That's all. From me, you mean? Yes. Or just heard about it. Well, who else if not me? Roy, really. - Have you been spying on me? No dear, of course not. Don't be so silly. What are you getting at then? Who else could have told you if not me? Well, who else? Well, I thought the man on the door might have mentioned it. He comes in the caf? quite often. He knows you by sight. Bob Stevens? The chucker-out? He's not the chucker-out. He is the assistant manager. And he is a very nice man. What the ..? Have you gone nuts? Roy. What is this? What's going on here? Have you been going out with Bob Stevens? Well, why shouldn't she? - You keep out of this. - Look here. A kid like you. Talking like that to your own mother. Mother? Ha. A fine sort of mother she is. Well, I'll tell you this. I'm not standing for it, see. You bring Bob Stevens into this house and I'll get out for good. Roy, don't talk so silly. I never heard such a fuss about nothing. - Nothing? You call it nothing? An old woman like you going around with that .. - Old woman? Roy, don't be silly. I'm not forty yet. - Well that is old, isn't it? Of course it isn't. Plenty of women don't get married at all until they get to my age. And have babies, too. - Shut up! It's horrible. Roy, really. I tell you I don't want to hear no more about it. Let me tell you something else. You bring Bob Stevens here and I'll kill him, see. I'll kill him. Roy. And then you really will have something to worry about. So now you know. Don't you. Excuse me, please. Hello Brian. Excuse me Mr Beverley, but have you got the prize for the spot waltz? Oh yes. Here it is. Thank you, sir. - Everything alright out there? Going fine. It?s an "excuse me" dance next. Your girl here tonight, Brian? You bet, sir. - Good, good. Alright, sir. So you think it's working out do you, Beverley? I think so. I'm a bit doubtful about Roy Walsh, I must say. He's the clever one. Collins is just an overgrown urchin. Yes. It's hard to judge in a couple of months of course. Do they attend regularly? - Yes. Fairly regularly. They shy off at the first hint of anything faintly educational. Well, let me come. I think I can do something with Collins. He even introduced two new members last week. Oh? And Walsh, has be brought anyone in? No. He brought a boy with him tonight as a guest. By the name of "Skinny" I gather. Skinny? Where did you leave the bikes? - Outside. Behind the fire escape. What's yours like? A Rudge, drop handles. Cream with white mudguards. Okay. Got your cosh? Yeah. A new one. Made it last week in the leatherwork class. How long do you reckon you'll be gone? Twenty minutes. We'll make it snappy. - Don't worry. We'll hold the fort. They won't miss us. - With all this going on, who's to know? Why don't you cut in, Alfie? Lost your nerve? Who's that? Do you know her? - Know her? Cor, that's rich. That's Rene. - Well, who the hell is Rene? Don't be soft. It's only my kid sister. What are you talking about? You ain't got no sister. Ain't I? Well, that's who my mum says it is. Why did you never tell me about her? Why should I? She only came home last week. She's been down in the country. Okay. We ain't doing the job. Eh? You said .. - I said we ain't doing it. See you later. Okay, mine. Got a nerve, haven't you? - It's an "excuse me" dance, isn't it. Yes I know, but .. - Who's that you were dancing with? Brian? Oh, he's just a fellah. - Did he bring you here? What if he did? - He ain't taking you home. That's all. Oh, isn't he? We'll see about that. Come out here. What do you think you're going to do now? Talk to you. Any objection? - I suppose not. What about? - Well. Alfie has told you all about me I suppose? How should I know? - Well, I'm the .. I'm Roy Walsh. Pleased to meet you. What am I supposed to do, faint or something? Okay, skip it. You work in a shop or something? - I'm a sales girl. Where? - Arcadia Stores. Want to know all about me, don't you? Yeah. You don't want to go back in there, do you? Well of course I do. I'm enjoying it. Besides, Brian will be wondering where I've got to. Brian. - He's a very nice boy. Training to be an accountant. - Yeah? Then he'll buy you a pearl necklace I suppose? I shouldn't be surprised. Listen .. you stick with me and you can have a pearl necklace. What you talking about? - I mean it. You come out with me and I'll get you anything you want. I've got brains, see. I'm not like the others. I'm going places. I'm going to be a big-shot. - What, you? Yeah. And I'm not going to work my guts out either. I know the tricks, see. What you going to do? Rob a bank or something? Yeah. Now maybe that's what I will do. - I'll bet. And then you'll wake up. Screaming for your mum. - Shut up! Let go! You don't know all the tricks, do you. Big-shot. How did you do, Walshie? What's the matter? Wasn't she having any? Here, you won't be mucking her about .. - Shut up. Where is Darkie? - Dancing. Why? We're doing the job. - Eh? But you said .. - I said the job's on. Go on, you and Alfie get going. I'll see you below in a few minutes. It's okay, come on. - Take it easy. Don't hurry. Get after Darkie when he finishes. If anyone asks, just say we're around somewhere, see. Yeah. Left it a bit late now haven't you, Walshie? I know what I'm doing. Okay, be seeing you. I shall not half cop it from my mum when she hears about Walshie and our Rene. Don't worry about that now. I know, but she .. - Alright, alright. Come on, give me the cosh. - Okay. Only take care of it. It's a new one. This is yours, the Rudge. Is this it? - Yeah. There she is. - Don't hit her too hard, Pete. Don't worry. I'll leave her some aspirin. On your way. Have you got a light, dearie? - No. Have a bit of this instead. Stop that! Help. Help! Help. Cor, she's tough that Queenie. Tough? Two to one? I don't know why I hang around with you lot. Do you want this bag, Walshie? [ Police whistle ] Blimey, they've found her. Quick. Over here. [ Dogs barking ] Dogs. Walshie, we're in the blinking dog's home. Give me that bag. Now you've done it. - Here, come on. Where you going? Alright. All clear, come on. Can you give us a description of your assailants? My what? That's quite enough of that. How would you describe the men who attacked you? As a dirty lot of stinking rotten sons of .. Alright. What did they look like? - How the hell should I know? Do you suppose they came up and raised their blooming hats before they hit me? No description .. available. How about that bag? How much money did you have in it? I don't know. Ten quid. Fifteen maybe. Well, more than I could afford to lose anyway. Business not so good, eh? Bit of a nuisance in summertime, isn't it? Very funny I am sure. What about this black eye of mine? - Better go home. Put something on it. Bit of steak is the best thing they say. Steak? Is that the best you can do for me? I can give you some advice. Sooner have the money. Queenie, be a good girl. You want a tip? - Well? Don't go walking alone along dark streets at night. Blimey, you have not half been a time. Where you been? We got stuck in the dog's home. Never mind all that. Come on, one at a time. Okay, you first. How you going to split it, Walshie? Here. A pound each for you and Pete. Ten bob for the other two. Better get inside, hadn't we? - Wait a minute. That sister of yours. - Eh? I want her to come out with me. - You'd better ask her, hadn't you. You got to see she does come out with me. I can't make her can I, if she don't want to. Listen. I'm taking her out Sunday. Be on the corner of Jessop Street at half past ten. You make sure she's there, see. Or else. Okay Walshie, I'll tell her. - Yeah. And don't forget. - I won't. She ain't like the other kids around here you know. She's been down in the country ever since the war, see. I reckon she'd be scared stiff of you. - What are you talking about? You trying to tell me she ain't been with any fellahs? I'm sure she ain't. She's only a kid, see. Yeah? Well. Maybe it's time she learned a thing or two then. Here Walshie, you .. - You shut up. And listen. That powder thing you pinched the other night. You mean the compact, the gold one? Gold? If it had been gold I'd have .. Anyway, you still got it? - Yeah, it's in my drawer. Let me have it tonight on the way home. What do you want it for? To give to Rene? Mind your own business. - Yeah, but Walshie. I'll give you half a dollar for it. Now go on, get inside. Alright. Yeah, alright. Oh Gran, I can't get over them. They're lovely. They really are. You shouldn't have spent all that money. - Go on with you, girl. If I can't give you a bit of something on your birthday .. Anyway, they didn't cost nothing much. - You can't tell me that. Look at the time. We're going to get ready for church. Give Roy another shout will you, dear. He said especially to call him. - Roy! It's after ten. Ah shut up. I know. That's what you get for giving him his breakfast in bed. Well, he was so late in last night. What did he give you? - Huh? You know what, Gran. I'm going to keep this on all day. I said: "what did Roy give you?". Roy? Well, he was so sleepy when I brought his breakfast in. Didn't he wish you many happy returns? - Now, Gran. He'll remember when he's properly awake. Ha. Maybe. Gran, please don't spoil everything. They must have cost ever so much. Are you sure .. - For goodness sake, girl. What's the good of me keeping all that money under my mattress .. If I don't use a bit of it now and again? There you are, dear. Roy, you do look nice. Are you coming to church with us? - No, I've got a date. You haven't been for a long while, dear. I'll come next week. Bye. - Hey. Ain't you got nothing to say to your mother? What is this? - Don't you know what day it is? Oh, for Pete's sake, I'm in a hurry. It doesn't matter, Gran. - It does matter. If a boy can't remember his own mother's birthday .. - Eh? Go on. Go on, Is it? Cor, fancy me forgetting that. Well, you've remembered it now. Yeah. Well. Many happy returns. Blimey, where did you get that? Gran gave it to me. Isn't it lovely. - Yeah. Yeah. That is just the sort of thing I wanted to .. Here. Hang on a minute. I told you he hadn't really forgotten. So that's the best he can do in the way of remembering. Here you are, Mum. I forgot all about it. A gold compact. It was just what I wanted. - I've been saving up for it. I'm afraid it is only second hand. I couldn't get a new one. Not good enough for you. It's alright though, ain't it? - Roy, its perfect. That's alright then. Well, I'm off. Goodbye, dear. Bye. - Bye. Bye, Gran. Half a minute, Walsh. Caught you just in time, didn't we. In time for what? The Inspector wants to ask you a few questions. Yeah? Would you tell me where you were last night, Walsh? I don't mind. At the youth club. We had a dance on. Why? Were you there at eleven? I was there all the evening. Finished at twelve. Had the last waltz with Marlene Smith. Not bad, either. Got your alibi pat, haven't you, Walsh. I'm on probation aren't I. You can't fool me you're here for the good of my health. What's it all about anyway? A woman wash coshed last night by two boys on the corner of Jubilee Terrace. They got away on bicycles. I ain't got a bicycle. - You could have borrowed one. Maybe I could, but I didn't. You can't dance with a bicycle. Or haven't you heard? Cheek won't get you anywhere my lad, except into trouble. Is the woman bad? She's in hospital. Go on. Want me to send her some flowers? Don't be too clever, will you Walsh. The jails are full of people who are too clever you know. I'm only on probation. Hey, Walshie. Twenty-four. - Oh. I thought it was thirty-four. Twenty-four. That makes you 270 right? Blimey, get a load of the whistle and flute. Like the drapes? Latest cut. - Very nice. When do you go for the next fitting? - That's not funny. Where is Rene? She went on the river for the day. Who with? Brian Edwards. You told me you were going to fix it. I've a good mind to cut your ear off. Lay off, Walshie. He couldn't help it. Why you always picking on him? Do you want some too, Pete? Because you can have it. Alright. Where they gone? Greenwich from Westminster peer. - What time they coming back? Well mum said Rene had to be in by half past ten. That means they'll be coming down Cripp's Alley about the o'clock. Right. We'll be there too. We'll show Mr Brian ruddy Edwards. - What are you going to do, Walshie? What do you think we're going to do? Give him the treatment of course. On your own? I never do anything on my own. Thanks for offering to help, boys. But I've got to be home by ten. I said thanks for offering to help. Okay, Walshie. We're with you. I wish I could see more of you, Rene. It's so difficult with night school three times a week. You want to get on, don't you? Look at that big boat there. Montevideo. Where is that? - It's a port in South America. I wish I was on that boat tonight. Brian Edwards, Purser. You and all those se?oritas. What would you do in South America, Brian? Wait to get back to you. That's nice. Say it again. - Wait to get back to you. It don't make sense the second time. - It does to me. It don't make sense at all, really. People like us, we never get out. You will, Brian. You're different from the others. All the boys I know, they just want a good time. Do you want a good time too, Rene? Yes. I suppose I do. It's just like the pictures, isn't it. Just like the pictures. [ Rene scream! ] Roy. Hello, Rene. Where you going? - It's Brian. They're beating him up. I don't want to get mixed up with the police. Get in here. No, Roy. - Get in here. Roy! Roy, let me go! Let go of me! Sorry about that, Rene. But you can't get mixed up with the police. Not with Alfie on probation. Yeah. I suppose you're right. Well, thanks anyway. I suppose I'd better go home. What's the hurry? Don't I get a reward? Reward? A kiss. Don't talk soft. You're behind the times, Rene. You want to catch up with yourself. You don't want to miss all the fun in life, do you? You shouldn't have done that, Rene. I can get tough too, you know. We're going to stay awhile. Take off your coat. Make yourself comfortable. No, Roy. No! Come on, now. What's this about you going out with Roy Walsh? What of it? I'll tell you what of it, my girl. It's got to stop, do you hear? They say you've been going about with him regular for the past two months. Well? I'm sixteen, and I can do as I please. Roy Walsh knows how to treat a girl. Give her a good time. He's no good I tell you. Look what happened to Alfie. That's not affair of mine. - Well, it is of mine. And you're not going out with that little swine and that's that. Give me that! You'll end up like your brother in the police courts, that's what you will. Yeah? Well it won't be for coshing old ladies. No. It will be for catching old men. He'll have you at that soon enough. Mark my words. - Get away! Her mum, what do you think? - It's all your fault. What did I do? - You're always doing it. Here, Mum. - What? I got a rise today. Oh, Alfie love. Come and have some supper dear. I've got a nice chop in the kitchen. Roy? Are you there? - Yeah. I'm just going round to the churchyard. Shan't be long. Okay. Where did you get those? - From the store in Clancy Street. Nice, aren't they. What, Ted Moran's stall? They'll be dead by tomorrow. Dad used to grow these on his allotment. He always liked flowers you dad did. So does Ted Morgan. He makes 20 quid a week out of suckers like you. Cor, what a racket. Would you like me to lend you a couple of hairpins? Hello. Not late am I? Late? I had a bit of a do with mum. Same old stuff. Where we going? Pictures? You can go. I'm busy. - Yeah, but you said that .. I said I'm busy. I got to go to the club. What am I supposed to do then? Listen, I'm in a hurry. Well, if that's the way you feel. I didn't tell you, did I. Brian is out of hospital. Perhaps he's like to take me to the pictures. Okay, big-head. Don't bother to see me again. I suppose I'd better go home. How about tomorrow then? Maybe. I'll see. I've got to go now. Thank you. It's almost like being abroad. The south of France or somewhere. You'd never think we were only a mile or so from home. It's not a hard job to make you happy, is it Elsie. How do you mean? A little walk and a bite to eat in Battersea Park. A lot of women wouldn't think much of a man who couldn't do better than that. I suppose I ought to try and get myself a better job. I don't know. Somehow .. Have you ever thought about going back to Canada? That's a no-go. I want to forget about Canada. Surely after all this time ..? That is dead. It's over. This is the new life. The only thing is I can't seem to get interested in it by myself. I know what you mean. Let's take a look at the river, huh. Oh by the way, I saw Roy last night. Where? - At the Palidrome. Really? By himself, do you mean? No, he had a girl with him. There was dancing last night. A girl? Are you sure, Bob? Why? Don't you know about it? I didn't know. It's not that I mind really. He was bound to get interested in girls sooner or later. - Yeah. How has he been behaving? Now, Bob. Elsie. Why don't you face the facts just for once? The boy treats you like dirt. - That's not true. Yes it is. You never know where he is, what he's doing, who he's with. He's not a child. - Look, he's on probation. It's your job to see that he behaves himself. I know. You spend your life with your head in the sand, don't you Elsie. Pretending he's the kind of boy you want him to be and knowing so well he's not. I don't know anything of the sort. - Well, I do. Won't you please let me take a hand with him? There is worse trouble ahead for you if you don't. I'm sure of that. Bob. I know how you feel about him. Believe me. Will you marry me? If only for his sake? No. If I marry you at all it will be because I want to be married to you. You must believe that. I want to talk to you. It's urgent. - Right. Over here. This will do it. - What's this? It's alright. I'll play you for a bob. Okay. Henry Whistler been on to me again. He wants the fifty quid you owe him. He said I should get it from you tonight or else. He gave me that dialogue too. What are you going to do, Walshie? Here. Cop this. Blimey. How much here? Thirty. Put it away. - But you owe him fifty. You shouldn't play those doggies so hard. Oh get stuffed, you. - Alright. Where will you get the other twenty? - I'll think of something. Maybe I know where you can get it. And a lot more besides. Yeah? Shoot. You know that new job I've started? What, at the Palidrome? They've changed their policy there now, see. Instead of dancing every night. They have three nights dancing and other nights wrestling and that sort of thing. So what? There's a lot of money in the box office at a wrestling match, Walshie. Three times more than dancing. That's a lot of money. What are you getting at? - Wrestling is alright. The managers get a bit. The wrestlers get a bit. But the box office take the most. - So? Simple. If the box office takes the most .. Take the box office. And what if the cops take us? Nah, you can organise that, Walshie. Yeah, maybe I can. What's the drill? While the bouts are on .. the corridors and surrounds will be quiet. The money is taken from the box office to the manager's office. In a leather bag carried by one man. If our boys could be in the corridor as he passes. Cosh, snatch. Job is done. No go, Pete. I know Bob Stevens, the assistant manager at the Palidrome. He knows me. I'll be asking for trouble. Bob Stevens? That's the guy who carries the money. That settles it. No go, Pete. There's lights in the corridor. I can switch them off. He'll never see you. No, not this time, Pete. I'll get the twenty from somewhere else. If you change your mind, let me know. I start a week of nights from tomorrow at the Palidrome. What are you trying to do, cheat? Who, me? Now, would I do anything so dishonest? You oughtn't come back with me, Bob. Oh, let the neighbours talk. We're doing nothing wrong. - I know. Look, if we were married they'd have .. Elsie! Gran, what is it? - I want you to come. Shall I .. - No, you come with me. Gran, what's the matter? This is Bob. - If I can help at all. You'd better both come. Why? All my savings .. thirty pounds. All the money I'd saved up for Roy to have. All gone. Bits of newspaper. Nothing left. Just bits of newspaper. Gran, who could have done such a thing? How long since you last looked at it? A month or so. When I bought your birthday present. Was it all there then alright? - I think so. I didn't count it. Why did you look now, Gran? I .. I was going to .. I was going to get a nice wreath for Dave. Tuesday is the anniversary. Yeah, I know, Gran. Who could have done such a thing? I never told no-one about it. No-one at all but you .. and .. Someone must have got in. They could have got through that window from the yard. How would they get in? - Over the wall if they had a ladder. Unless they got in the front while we were all out. I never told no-one about it. But they might have heard about it. Just got in on the off-chance. And come across it by accident. Why would anyone think there was anything worth stealing in this place? Why shouldn't they? Oh, Gran. Why did he do it? He only had to wait. He'd have had it anyway. Just when I thought everything was going to turn out alright. Bob. What are we going to do? Where is he now? He just said he was going out. I left him here. I was going round to the churchyard. That's when he must have taken it. Do you mind if I wait until he gets back? Oh, will you? It's no business of mine, but .. - Please. It's about time there was a man in this house. Bob. You won't be too hard on him, will you. I'll treat him as if he were my own son. Here he is. Hi, Mum. What are you doing here? I want to talk to you, Roy. Oh Bob. - Leave him to it, Elsie. What is this? Who do you think you are coming here? - Shut up. I'm here because your mother asked me. I didn't want to interfere, but .. - Get the hell out of it. Don't you talk to me like that, young fellah. I'm not afraid of you. You big Canadian slob. Hit me. Go on, hit me and see what happens to you. Sit down, Elsie. Where is that money? Money? Don't know what you talk about. - Your Gran's money. Where is it? How should I know? Under the mattress, I suppose. That's where the old fool usually keeps it. That money is gone and you know it. Why should I know? - Because you took it. I did, did I? What the ruddy hell has it got to do with you? Who do you think you are? - I'll tell you who I am. I'm a man who won't stand by and watch a little rat like you .. Messing up your mother's life. Not if I can help it, you won't. You done this, didn't you. You've gone flirting around with this fellow and just because I .. Any more of that and I'll .. - Yeah? What will you do? You ain't got no rights here. You can't touch me. You try ordering me around and see what happens to you. I'll tell you something else. She ain't seeing you no more. Roy, you can't. - Can't I? You'll see. You go out with him and then listen to what people are saying about you. I'll show you who does the talking around here. No. Bob. It's alright, Elsie. I can take care of that one. I am going to marry your mother, Roy. If she'll have me. Then you can talk your head off. Only not to me you won't. Because if you do, you'll feel what it's like to have a belt around you. Now .. what about that money, huh? Roy! - Roy, stop it. Bob! Hello Pete? Listen. I've changed my mind. That job at the Palidrome. We're doing it. Never mind why. I've got my reasons. We'll fix it up tomorrow night at the club. Half past seven. Now, you tell the others. All of them. Okay? Pay attention. This is going to be our plan of attack. We'll have Robinson here. Smith here and Johnson here. Alfie here, and Darkie you're here. Now, you must remember your positions. How do you know he'll be on his own when he takes the money out? He always is. It's a regular thing. I've got it all worked out I tell you. They come to the box office after the interval is over. Then, when the girl has sorted out the money, he takes it to the office. Just like that, in his hands? How can he carry hundreds of quid in his hands? He's got it in a bag. That's what makes it so easy. Pete puts the lights out just as we .. Hello Mr Beverley. - Hello there. There is a young woman out here to see you, Walsh. Me? Come along now, don't be shy. Who is it, Alfie's sister? - Rene wouldn't come here. Girls. Always hanging round your neck. Back in a minute. What the hell do you mean coming here? I told you .. I had to, Roy. I had to. - Why? What about? We can't talk here. Here. Now. I had to go and see a doctor today. What's that? Please don't be cross, Roy. And he said. I'm going to have a baby. A what? You'll have to marry me, Roy. Mum will kill me if she finds out. I don't know what to do. You'll have to marry me. Yeah? And what are we going to live on? I can go working for a bit. We'll make out alright. Please Roy. What do you take me for? How do I know it's not that Brian? - No Roy, it was you. I've never been with anyone else. I swear I haven't. You can't prove that. - Roy. Anyway, I'm not marrying you and that's all about it. What am I going to do? Do what you like. I don't care what you do. Only keep away from me. I thought .. I thought you loved me. Don't give me that stuff. Just because you got yourself into a mess you're not mucking my life up, see. Oh, but if we were married .. - Yeah? And who would marry us? You under age and me on probation. A fine couple, aren't we. Now come on. Get out of here. Roy. Roy, please help me. Please. I told you I don't want nothing more to do with you. Now go on, get out. Roy! What did she want, Walshie? - Oh, forget it. Okay Skinny, watch it. Now then. We're here, see. As he comes along here, you turn the lights out Pete, Right? Right. - Hey .. But what if he shouts, Walshie? That corridor is only just behind the circle. Don't think we ain't thought of that. Even if he does shout no-one won't hear him. Ain't you ever been to a wrestling do? The crowd scream their heads off. Hardly hear yourself think. Yeah. And if Mr Bob ruddy Stevens does kick up a dust .. Where'd you that, Walshie? Bought it this morning. Off a fellow I know. Who's going to have it? - Who do you think? You're the heavy boy of this outfit, ain't you? What me, Walshie? - Yeah. But not until Friday, right. - Watch it. Double tops, go for it. - Bet you a tenner he don't make it. Up a bit. Times up, boys. - Last throw, sir. Who's winning? - Me. It's in the bag, innit, Walshie? Yeah, that's right. It's in the bag. And I now pronounce you man and wife. There you are, and may I be the first to congratulate you both. And wish you long life and happiness together. Thank you. God bless you dear. Thanks for coming alone, Miss Lorraine. Sorry it was such short notice. Oh, that's quite alright. I'm never very busy at this time of day. Elsie dear, every so many congratulations. Thank you. You're a lucky girl. Isn't she? No luckier than what he is. - That's true enough. I must ask you all to sign the register before you leave. Of course. I mustn't be late. - Where do I sign? Don't tell me you are going to work today? Yes. Bob has to be at the Palidrome tonight anyway. They've got something special on. A wrestling match or something. We're going off first thing in the morning. Come on, honey. Sign the book. What will young Roy think about this when he knows? Be a bit of a shock for him, won't it? Now don't you worry about that. We'll face that when we come to it. I don't like this, Walshie. Here. Is it loaded? - What do you think? Remember, use that if I tell you. That's all. Okay, Walshie. Look, I have the cosh. Won't it be better if you had it? Do as you're told. I got to keep myself clear so I can change the plan if there's a slip up. You always keep yourself clear, don't you, Walshie. - So what? Nothing. I was just agreeing with you. That's all. Alfie! Alfie Collins! Alfie Collins! That's Marlene Smith. Go on, see what it is. Oh Alfie, I've been looking for you everywhere. Your mum sent me. You've got to come home at once. Why, what's up? - Please come, it's Rene. Rene? What's the matter with her? - Come, she's .. She's done herself in. Eh? She's threw herself in the river. Please come, your mum wants you. The river? She was home dinnertime, - Please, Alfie. Yeah, I'll come. Just a minute. Give me back what I gave you. What? Oh yeah. Go on then, if you go to. Walshie, what did she want to go and do that for? How do you know she has done, eh? Well, go on then. Don't stand there. - Come on, Alfie. What about that, eh? What are you going to do now, Walshie? What do you think we're going to do? What, you mean the job is still on? Of course it is. Just changed things around a bit. That's all. It won't make no difference. Cor, fancy young Rene. - Shut up! That ain't nothing to do with us. - I know, but .. Shut up about it then. I want to think things out. If she's done herself in, she's done herself in. And that's the end of that. I'm sorry, Mum. I didn't mean to. That's alright, Rene. I'm not blaming you. It wasn't your fault. I know that. You mustn't blame him. Little swine. - No, Mum. Please don't. He didn't mean to hurt me. He loves me. I know he does. He loves you and he does a thing like this? Mum. I want him to love me. I want him to love me. Now, now, this won't do at all. Come along now. Mum, don't go. Don't leave me. I'll be back, Rene. Mum. Ah, Mrs Collins. That's alright. Thank you, nurse. You can go. We've done all we can for the moment. Now you must go home and try not to worry. She'll be alright. - Yes, I think so. She's young. Did you know she was going to have a child, Mrs Collins? Of course not. If I had do you think I'd have let her .. She is, not married of course? No? Well that accounts for her doing what she did, I imagine. Well, that's one problem that's solved itself anyhow. You mean she's not going to ..? - No, there's not going to be a child. The shock was far too great. Thank God for that. Well, that's a matter of opinion. Look, Mrs Collins. Don't judge her too harshly, will you. After all, is she is fond of this man .. - Fond of him? Little swine. Just let me get at him. - Now that's not way to talk. Don't you talk to me. I know what I's saying. Now, Mrs Collins. Out of my way. I'm her mother, ain't I? Do you think I'm going to let the little gangster do this and get away with it? "Please, ladies and gentlemen." "This is the main event of the evening." "A heavyweight contest." "Of six rounds, three minutes each round." "The first to have three falls .." "Submissions or a knock-out to the winner." "Introducing with very great pleasure .." "From Blackfriars .." "The wrestling world's favourite .." "Donny McDean!" What's going on? [ Gunshot! ] That was a close one. - Yeah. A tough nut that Stevens. What's up, Walshie? Supposing I've killed him? I said you shouldn't have carried that gun. Suppose I've killed him? Then you'll be taking the 9 o'clock walk. You'll be topped for certain. Shut up! They've got to prove it first. Maybe you only winged him. - Yeah, maybe. What are we going to do now? What can we do? We're in real trouble this time. You mean you are, Walshie. - Listen. Maybe I did pull the trigger but to the law we're all in this together. The law don't worry me. I'm under age. Still, it was fun while it lasted. - Where do you think you're going? Home. You'll lie low with us, see. - Not a chance. I'm starving. Besides, my mum hates me being out late. Listen, I'm the boss and I say you're staying. Nothing doing, Walshie. If they're going to slap me in the corner tonight .. I'm going in with a double helping of my mum's steak and kidney pud. You can hang around her if you want to. Me? I'm getting out. What are we going to do? Do you think we could get on a boat? Get abroad somewhere? Yeah. No, that's no use. If we go on the run they'll know we did it. Well, what are we to do? I know what I'm going to do. I'm going home and wait for them to fetch me. You can't do that, Pete. You can't leave me here by myself. Not in this place. Do you know, Walshie ..? I think you're yellow. I've got a gun, Pete. I'll shoot you. I'll shoot you! Yeah? Go on then .. shoot. It's been a wonderful day. - Well, there you are, dear. My ironing ain't what it was but I think it will do. Thanks, Gran. It's lovely. It's a pity you couldn't have got away today. - Never mind. We'll have two whole days. Just fancy. Bob says our rooms are so near the sea you can hear it. I wish Roy would come home. If you'd any sense you'd have gone round to the garage and told him this morning. As soon as you done it. - I know. Here he is. You don't think he'll mind too much do you, Gran? He'll get used to it. And if he doesn't .. Roy! What's happened? Never mind all that. You got to help me. Give me all the money you got. You've got to. I've got to get out. How much you got? - Roy, I .. For Pete's sake, I'm in trouble I say. Do you want the cops to get me? No. Don't give him anything, Elsie. - You mind your own business. Mum. I'll never ask you to do anything for me again. Only just this once, you got to .. What's that? [ Door knocks ] Don't tell her I'm here, Mum. Don't tell her I'm here. She'll kill me if she gets hold of me. Gran. Gran, what are we to do? You'll have to open it, dear. Alright. I'll .. I'll go. Now then, where is he? Who is it you want, Mrs Collins? - Don't you come that stuff with me. Where is he? When I get hold of him I'll break every bone in his blasted little body. Mrs Collins, what is it? What is this all about? It's about my Rene going off her head and jumping in the river. Because she's going to have a kid. That's what it's about! Going to have a baby? Yes. My Rene only sixteen and your dear little Roy gets hold of her. That's not true. Oh yes it is. She's lying in the hospital now. She's not going to have the kid, the poor little swine, and she's not going to die. If she had, your little archangel would be a murderer if he's not one already. What do you mean by that? Come on! Where is he? Where is he? - I'm going for the police, Elsie. Don't bother. They'll be here soon enough. Alfie has told them plenty. The police come here? Yes. And let him try a gun on them and see what happens. Gun? - That's what I said. A cosh ain't good enough for him now, nor a razor. He's got to have a gun. The best thing he can do is blow his own brains out but he hasn't got the guts. Now! - No you don't. Oh, so that's how it is. Elsie, Elsie! Nobody is going to stop me! Let me get hold of him. I'll teach him. That's enough of that. - Let go of me! Who do you think you are? - Come outside. Take your hands off me! I'm going to get hold of him if it's the last thing I do. Come out you little punk! Come out! Come out! I'll get hold of him. Elsie .. I've got to talk to you. Bob, what has happened? She's been saying the .. - Where is Roy? He's in his bedroom. He's locked himself in. What has happened? I can't say right now. The police will be here any moment. You and Gran go into your bedroom and leave this to me. What's he done? You've got to trust me, Elsie. Roy is in trouble. Real trouble. That woman said .. No. Not the girl. This is something else. Bob. Gran, take her into the bedroom. Come along, dear. He's the boss now, you know. But I must know. Elsie. Roy is going to prison. For a long time. Oh God. There is no-one can help him. Except me, maybe. What are you going to do, Bob? You heard what I said, Gran. Please look after her. You never ought to have married me. That's the one good thing that's happened today. Go on up. Roy! Unlock the door. If you don't, I'll kick it in. You try and lay a finger on me, mister. And you'll get a slash across the kisser with this. Put that razor down. Try and make me. - Don't be a fool. The police are coming. If they find you with a razor .. Cops? So what .. they can't touch me. They can put me in the nick for 10 years. And they will. You darned near killed a man tonight. If there hadn't been a doctor on hand, you'd now be a murderer. Fine. If the cops come, I'm ready for them, see. But they can't touch me. Nobody can touch me. It's against the law. If you think I'll give a bully like you a chance .. Put that razor down or am I going to make you. You make me? Who the hell do you think you are giving orders around here? I'll tell you who I am Roy since you don't seem to know already. I'm your stepfather. Your mother and I were married this morning. What .. you filthy rotten .. - That's enough of that. I'll kill her, I'll kill her! - Give me that razor. Don't you come any closer. I'm warning you. Stay where you are or you'll get it. Can't you see I mean that? Now we'll see who's boss in this house. Let me go! Stop it, you're hurting me. That's nothing to what you're going to get. What you going to do? You can't touch me, it's against the law. You're not going to bash me up. - No? What of all the helpless women that you've bashed? I never! I never bashed nobody. Honest I didn't. It was the others. You're a rotten little coward. Now listen to me. You're going to jail. You deserve every minute you're going to be there. But for you mother's sake I'll try and help you. I don't know what you're talking about. Let go of my arm! The judge would order you a thrashing if he could, but he can't do that nowadays. If he hears you've had one from your stepfather, he may let you off lighter. Mum won't stand for it. She won't stand for it I tell you. You ask her. I'll scream for help. She won't ever speak to you again if you start on me. You'll see. Mum! Gran! Gran! Mum .. Mum! Get over there. If you've got any guts at all you'll take what's coming to you. I'm going to give you a thrashing you'll remember until the day you die. The thrashing you ought to have had every day for the last year. Let me go. Let me go, I say. Hand me over to the cops if you want to. I'm sorry for what I've done. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry! I'll go straight if you give me a chance. I swear I will. For my mother's sake, don't bash me. - A pity you didn't think of her before. Don't you realise you've broken her heart? Get up you little rat. You make me sick! Alright. I'll take the medicine. I'll show I'm not what you think I am. I'll take it. I'll .. Mum! Ah, so here he is. Well, Walsh? - Alright. I done it. Don't you worry. I'm coming. I've won. I've won I tell you. You can't touch me now. Nobody can touch me. So you can go .. - No more of that, Walsh. Where's his mother? In her bedroom. Do you need her? - Well, she ought to be here. Who are you, a friend of hers? - I'm her husband. We were married this morning. - Oh, I see. Congratulations. Yes, I see. Sergeant, I think we'll get the other boy first, don't you. Skinny Johnson? Right, sir. Just round the corner. Be back in ten minutes. Put Jones on outside. - Yes. Eh? No, wait. You can't do that. You got to take me. Don't worry, Walsh. We're going to take you. In ten minutes. Come on, Sergeant. - Stop! Stop. Wait! Come back! All yours, mister. - You've got to take me. You can't do this. Come back! Keep away from me. Come back! Come back. You ?an't leave me here. What's the trouble, Inspector? No trouble at all now, Queen?e. The trouble is all over. T-G ??
