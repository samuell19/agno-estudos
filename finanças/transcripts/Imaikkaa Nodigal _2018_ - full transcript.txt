Amazon Prime Official Subtitles icnghn Hello Boss! This is restricted area. Hello Guru! Even this is a restricted area. No one is allowed inside. Hello, who are you and don't seem to understand. Jessica! Yes! Vignesh Hegde's kidnapping and murder case, which is standstill for two weeks, has been passed on to CBI from the hands of Karnataka Police Department. This is what the Chief of Bureau has to say... ...see, we've submitted all the reports and files to the Special Crimes Division of CBI. Nonsense, you should ask the CBI director about that. -Thanks, thanks...please give way. -Sir, Sir...please Sir. Two weeks ago in Bengaluru, Hegde Group of Companies' Chairman Pawan Kumar Hegde's son Vignesh Hegde... ...was kidnapped from the Golf course. He is 22 years old. Ramesh Bhatt of CBI states that... ...officially CBI will handle this case henceforth. We've initiated all the investigations. This doesn't look like a kidnapping or a murder done for ransom. Possibly this can continue. In that case... ...parents please contact us without any hesitation. We have the best officers working on this. Have you reached, where I had asked you to come? Ya, I'm here. Good, now turn right and start walking. Just a minute. I know my daughter Jessica is with you. But the boy whom you had kidnapped earlier... ...you've killed him, in spite of the ransom given to you. If I hand over the money to you now... ...what's the guarantee that you'll let my daughter go. Guarantee? If you want your daughter Jessica back, you play by my rules George. You don't have a choice. See darling it's very simple. Don't look for help with Police and CBI. If you shut up and do as I say... ...I'm going to let your daughter go. Now... ...turn right and start walking. Move! Anjali here, Rachel come in. Yes Ma'am! Have you tracked down the call details? Did you get a location? No Ma'am, he's making an internet call. He's using TOI to manipulate his location and IP address. It refreshes and shows up as he's in a different country every second. Smart! Ok guys, listen up! Yes Ma'am! Yes Ma'am...Yes! May be it's just one guy who's doing everything, or it might be a network too. Just keep watching. Just follow the guy who comes and picks up the cash from him. Keep me updated and wait for my orders. Keep Walking. Keep Walking. He's here. Anbuarasan, he's right here and watching everything. What makes you say that, Anjali? When that ambulance passed George, I heard double sound. And I think, he's also using a voice changer. There is distraction and pitch variations in the voice. Photograph every one of them, who are on the phone here. Boys. Girls. Men. Women. Everybody. Keep....Walking! Keep....Walking! Walk...! Keep...Walk...! Stop! Do you see a white van on your left? Far off! Leave the suitcase inside that George. Is someone under sight on the left side? What van is that? And how long is it been parked there? Still checking, we don't have a clear view. Officers, I want someone to check on it immediately. Keep Walking. Keep Walking. -Camera on that street! -Uh...Ok! No, not here. Keep Walking. Shit! Oh! Oh...Oh! Oh no! CBI! I got whiff of this at first. How did they manage to come here, George? I'm sure, you wouldn't have asked them to come. 'Cause you want your daughter back. Moreover, you want her alive. Then who must've informed them? I panicked... ...I did ask CBI not to interfere in this matter. I'm totally unaware of them being here. My daughter... ...please don't do anything to Jessica. You raised her with so much love. She grew up to be a young woman. I've kidnapped a s**t girl. As a father, what must be going on in your head... ...they won't know it, but I know it very well. Poor thing... ...understand the sentiments of Mr. George. Mrs. Anjali Vikramadithyan SP-CBI! How are you? Anyways, let's get back to business, Mr. George. They're here for nothing but to just witness the fun. Ok, let's put up a good show. Ask the people inside the van to get down. Put that suitcase inside. Do you drive? He's on top. Anjali, let's round up the terrace. Wait! Ok George! Do you see Barleyz at the building opposite to you? I see it. Four floors by lift, and one floor by stairs. I'm on the terrace. Come, come! All officers &amp; photographers take positions on terrace of all the surrounding buildings. I want to know who is he? Anjali, you're making a mistake. We have weapons, let's get to the terrace and lock him down. What's the point? We still don't know, if he's alone or with a team. What if he has kept Jessica elsewhere. We have to rescue that girl alive. That's our main objective. -Just do what I say. -Yes Ma'am. Kailash! Damn! Take positions! Take positions! Keep Walking. Ma'am, doesn't seem like anyone is on that terrace. Yes Ma'am, no one is inside. Now stop! Can you please throw that suitcase down. What!? Throw damn it! Oh Shi...! Photographers stay right here. I want pictures of everyone getting in and out of the basement. All eyes on the suitcase, officers rush to basement immediately. Yes Ma'am! -That side. -Yes Sir! Anjali he isn't here to pick up the suitcase. He's planning for something else. -Ma'am! -Uh! Yes Ma'am, there's no one inside. Jessica! Jessica! Jessica! It's Jessica, George. Jessi... George...! NO! Jessica! I've seen the autopsy reports. Bleed to death. In order to prolong the blood from clogging, he gives them anticoagulant injection, and drains out the entire blood from the body. He has jammed the CCTV cameras, wherever he went. How's it even possible? No fingerprints, not even DNA traces. That girl was not raped. To be precise, he didn't even lay a finger on her. His motive wasn't that... ...he must've enjoyed looking at them die. Must be some sort of a... ...psycho! In spite of saying so much, you keep asking what's the issue? Uncle, have you gone nuts!? People out here... ...don't know how to raise a cute little girl. Look here, you don't have to say all that. When are you coming down? I don't like being here. It's really stressful. Shalu, did you eat? Hey, I'm talking to you. No ma'am, she didn't eat her breakfast. She didn't!? Why aren't you eating? Who are you speaking to? What does it matter to you, to whom I'm talking? Anyways you have deceived me. Fine, sorry. Now tell me who are you talking to? I'm speaking to uncle. Oh Arjun, give it to me. She wants to talk to you. He doesn't want to talk to you it seems. Won't talk to me!? Just give it to me. Uncle, I'm not giving her the phone... -...she's pulling it from me -Give it! Hello! Hello! Hello! He hung up on you! Hey, when did you change the wallpaper? It was me and you on the wallpaper until yesterday. I started disliking you since yesterday. That's why I've changed it. You don't like me? -Fine, come on. -Don't touch. Hey come on! Let me go, leave me. She'll be back by 2pm from school, keep her clothes washed. Ok madam. -Baby, It's me Dad speaking... -Baby, It's me Dad speaking... -Are you fine? -Are you fine? -Dear you shouldn't be like your Dad. -Dear you shouldn't be like your Dad. -You should be brave like Mom. -You should be brave like Mom. -Shouldn't be scared of anything. -Shouldn't be scared of anything. -You should walk with your chin up. -You should walk with your chin up. -You should always speak looking into the eyes. -You should always speak looking into the eyes. -Shouldn't cry, no matter how tough it is. -Shouldn't cry, no matter how tough it is. -I've never seen your Mother cry. -I've never seen your Mother cry. -You should be the same. -You should be the same. -You should never be upset 'cause Dad isn't with you. -You should never be upset 'cause Dad isn't with you. -No matter how far I am... -No matter how far I am... -I'll always be thinking of you. -I'll always be thinking of you. -Even if I get a short break. -Even if I get a short break. -I'll come running to India. -I'll come running to India. Hey, say bye to Mom. Ah...tell me Anbuarasan. Ma'am, watch NDTV Hindu live right away. I'm on my way to office Anbuarsan... ...I'll be there in 10 minutes. No ma'am, it's really urgent. Watch it right away. Ok! Five years ago... ...kidnapping of the same kind, and 3 murders of the same pattern had happened. Which case are you referring to? Rudra's case handled by CBI. Rudra! You mean the serial killer Rudra!? Yes! The most sensational serial killer, Rudra. From Rudra's killing methods, CBI had confirmed that he must be a Doctor. Close friend of the murdered victims, Dr. Vineeth is Rudra... ...the case was closed by putting him down in encounter. Yes about four years ago. I remember. Poor thing, Dr. Vineeth was a scapegoat. In order to put a full-stop on the sensational case, that was a cover-up operation led by Anjali. She cooked it up completely. What!? How can we believe everything you say? What evidence do you have? I have a living proof. The real Rudra is still alive. Yes I'm Rudra... ...and I'm back! The two murders which happened currently, were done by me. And it will continue. -What!? -Who the hell are you? You're making an anonymous call and claim to be Rudra... ...are you trying to scare us? Do you know the punishment for fake threats? Fake threat!? You can fool the public. You guys and the CBI know... ...whether I'm Rudra or not? Murders which happened five years ago, and the murders happening now... ...is there even a small difference? Why don't you ask them? Anjali is not on top of her game these days. Let's make the game little easier. Before I kidnap my next target... ...I will definitely let you guys know. In fact, I'll tell you right now. On Live! Sir...! Sunday...that's in next 6 days. I'll kidnap my next target. Stop me if you can, Anjali. Good Luck! An anonymous caller, who claims to be Rudra, and behind the killings, has created a panic situation in Bangalore. He has also challenged the CBI that, he will take his next target out on Sunday. We're now in front of the CBI office Bangalore, where the CBI commissioner... He's right! May be media and public might not be aware... ...but we know. Five years ago Pratap, Ram, Jayanth... ...Rudra, kidnapped 3 high profile guys. He demanded a ransom of 2 crores, the parents did give the ransom. But still he killed them all and gave them the dead bodies. Recent murders and the murders committed by Rudra 5 years back, have got many similarities. The same high profile kids, and ransom of 2 crores. Even the modus operandi is same. That is in order for the blood from clogging... ...he gave them anticoagulant injection. Cut their jugular veins, and let them bleed to death. So my point is... ...why can't he be the original Rudra? Like he said, IPS Anjali was a new recruit at that time. May be due to the pressure from a sensitive case... ...might have covered it up. No Mr. Gowda, please stop it. She was a new recruit. The way she handled Rudra's case, the evidence and documents she had submitted were perfect. So please, she's a very special officer, and an asset to the department. Then she could've arrested Rudra and produced him in the court. Why was the encounter done? Narayan Sir! That operation was carried by a 5 member team. I was a part of it too. Our plan was to nab him alive. From the 148 we had interrogated... ...three were prime suspects. From that lot is this Rudra a.k.a Vineeth. This is a 2 acre farm house, Vineeth must be inside the bungalow in the center. This farm house has a total of 4 exits. Surround it from all sides. And at any cost, I want him alive. When we reached there, he was drunk. He lost control and started firing blindly. Drop the gun! I said, drop your weapon. Anbuarasan Sir, are you ok? I'm ok, Ma'am. Sir...! -Check if someone else is here. -Are you ok? Sir, be careful. Inside that room we found the ransom money of 6 crores. We also recovered murder weapons and his diary. Dr. Vineeth in the name of Rudra... ...killed his own friends for the ransom money. And pertaining to that evidence, we produced the 0.32 Webley Scott revolver as evidence in the court. And that was the end of Rudra. So Anjali, what do you think? Who must be doing it this time? Sir, may be not in our country, other countries have many cases like this. Jack the Ripper is a serial killer. There's a museum named after him. After him, murders of the same kind happened... ...stating I'm Jack the Ripper. Many copy cat killers came up that time. This looks more like it. Copying the murder pattern in the name of Rudra, someone alone or with a team must be doing this. Ma'am but he seems to be a smart one. Jamming the cameras, making untraceable calls using technology... ...may be he's a techie. Gowda Sir! If you sit down and research the internet... ...you can do the same in half an hour. You don't have to be a techie. Sir! He thinks he's smart. But he's not. I'll get hold of him soon. Bloody p*********t! Don't you have any sense, damn it! Just a miss... Hey Arjun, what are you doing? Boss sorry. Sorry, sorry it was a mistake. What!? What do you mean my mistake? What would've happened if it fell on my head? He wishes to see what happens... ...take this. Throw this right on his head. Hey! Hey, give that to me. Sorry boss. It's not a joke. Put all these bottles inside. -Hey, move out. -Hey! Hey Arjun, heard that you and Krithi broke up? Is it so? It's not that machan, you won't mind if I ask you something. Even I have a....on Krithi... ...a crush you can say. Hey, who the hell are you? So was checking, if you don't mind. I can give it a try. Digging his own grave! Bloody, I asked him nicely. Why did he beat me? Hey, you did ask him nicely... ...but the thing you asked was wrong. Ah ok, ok bye. I'll call you bye. Guys lying on the platform, don't forget to wake up. Fine, come on let's leave too. Hey, wait up, let the driver come. Huh? Why do we need a driver? He doesn't drive when he's drunk. -Why is that? -'Cause Anjali doesn't like it. He won't talk to his sister... ...but will listen to what she says. Let's leave. I'll drive. You're drunk too. He won't let you drive either. Come on sit down. -Hey...! -Let the driver come. I wasn't here for three years... ...meanwhile, you've fallen in love and broken-up. Hey, what exactly happened? She changed everything, Vetri. She turned it upside down. Give me details, what did she change? And when did she? This... ...when this Vodafone switched to zoo-zoo from that dog. That's when she changed it. You've been cribbing since morning. I found my soul-mate! Soulmate!? Never seen such a hot Doctor. How does she gets lucky with such good looking guys? How's my choice? I'm going to propose to him in pretense of giving him a brochure. No! Ey! Ey! Not a chance, give me that. I'm going... Ey, it was me who saw him first. Doesn't matter who saw him first, I'm going to be really pissed. Ey! Catch hold of her. Ey, the co-ordinator won't like it, if you go there. Oh no...why is he looking at us? Son, I have a stomach ache. Hold on a moment. Son! Son! My stomach is aching. Son! Eh...Son! Hey, this is too much. Hey...it's a girl! I knew it, when she hugged me. Take your hands off me, don't touch. Krithi, I'm really pissed. Get lost from here. Oh you're pissed!? Then so be it. Hey, she is been caught now. Hi! I'm Arjun. Why did you come and hug me? Ask her that! Hey, start singing... ...you're singing the wrong song. Fine, the promotions are understood. Why do you have to come so far? See I have a problem. Guys with shabby beard and mustache... ...I'm allergic to them hugging me. Just check this out. Hey, what are they doing? How's it? Was I any good? Hey, why did you beat me in front of them? So, you remove your mask... ...if you're a girl, I'll leave right away. But if you're a boy, then it's a totally different scene. Oh no! I'm a girl. Anyone can mimic that voice. Oh no! He has longer hair than me. Looks like they're not going to let us go. Hey Krithi, let's leave. Go, go, go, go! Sir, what's happening? Why are you humming? Checkout who is their co-coordinator. Ok. Need to find out, who's this girl. Ok! That fat zoo-zoo looks really cute. A girl will look at a guy only if she likes him a lot... ...but she have hugged you. It's confirm... ...so did you find her? Hey, what's this damn it? He had asked us to get her here, but is sitting like a statue in front of her. You brought me here to talk, but you've been just looking at me since we came here. You... ...if you stay mum like this, what does that mean? Ok, it was wrong to have hugged you that day. Why so? Is it a rule that only guys can check girls out? If a guy is cute and attractive... ...can't we girls check him out? Tell me, shouldn't we check him out? Can't shake hands with him? Can't we hug him? That's why... It's just that, in the moment I was... ...whatever! What else do you want to know? His wicket was down long ago. Fine, my name is Krithika Rao. I'm doing my final year in Visual Communication, modeling is my interest. I've been doing TV commercials. I'm decent with studies, an average student. I like to have a lot of people around me. I have a lot of friends, that's it. If you wish to know more... ...you have my number. You can call me anytime. As a friend. Actually, we can be very good friends. -I love you, Krithika! -Huh!? And...I think, I've fallen for you. Seriously! He said it, said it. She's reacting... I brought you here to say this... ...not to be your friend. Nor I can sing friendship anthem along with you. Shall we leave? What!? Where are you guys headed? Is she your girlfriend? -No. -Then sit down. Single guys don't seem to understand the feelings. Krithi, one minute. You said, I'm not speaking up and just looking. I spoke what I really wanted to. Now it's you, who isn't talking. Arjun! See, I never expected this. I met you for the first time today, I got fixated on you at the first sight. But you've seen me twice... ...don't you think of me like that? Fine, tell me... ...with the excuse I didn't speak up. Why did you blurt everything about you to me? I never asked. If you don't like me beyond all this... ...you wouldn't have looked me up on Facebook. The lame post which I had put on long back... ...you wouldn't have liked it. I can figure what exactly this is... ...but if you need time to realize that, I'm ready to give you that time. But I can't give you space. Here on, I'll meet you often. Will speak to you, text you, and will be always with you. You won't say no to it, you know that very well. You can tell me, when you feel like it. Even you're cute and attractive. I can hug you right!? Clueless language of yours... ...my eyes are looking for answers. Undying moments of ours... ...are like honey dew from a clock. Why don't you confess your love to me? There is no need for dramatics here. Don't cut the email short as a message. Confess it right in front of me. Just like the evening Ad-break... ...your beautiful face lights up. Rainbow which blooms inside your colorless heart... ...what's the state of its mind? I'm yours...are you mine? I'm stuck without a clue. If you confess that it's not... ...I will stop looking at you with love. If I pick the flower of love... ...your wait for it will come to an end. If the wait comes to an end... ...our paths will start to deviate. His dreams are part of mine. Day and night heart will long for it. Longing dreams will reach its destiny. In my life, it will become a word. Just like the evening Ad-break... ...your beautiful face lights up. Rainbow which blooms inside your colorless heart... ...what's the state of its mind? I'm yours...are you mine? I'm stuck without a clue. If you confess that it's not... ...I will stop looking at you with love. I never expected aunty to come over. Thanks Ju, best day of my life. Will you say something or you're going to remain silent? You're looking gorgeous! Since I've seen you, nothing else seems to be good. I knew it! I knew that you must have something up your sleeve. Anyways, your parents will come today. I was really nervous on what will I speak to them. Fine, why didn't they come? What happened Krithi? Ju...I... ...I would've said this earlier... ...my parents are divorced. They got divorced when I was 6, and went on being different families. In order to invite them for graduation, I called, sent messages... ...I tried everything. They didn't even reply. Ju, this is my family background. If I am suitable for you and your family, I'll be everything to you. If anything happens to you, I'll be right there at the brink of it. The question is, if I'm the right one for you? You just reply to that. Ju these three months... ...it was like a dream for me. Your family, friends... ...you! I wish to have everything. I would've confessed long back that I like you very much. But there was this fear... ...parents who loved me so much, just took off one day. What if the same happens with you? Just 'cause there's no one for me... ...what if you're planning to just goof around and break up. Let go off me now, Ju. I can't go through a break-up. Fine, then. Time is good, shall I break-up now? Will you be normal without me? I know how much I love you... ...and I know I'm serious about you. When you feel the same... ...and when you have that trust in me. Only then you can confess your love. I'll wait for you. Hey...! The trust is always there. Krithi dear... ...everyone is looking at us. Your lecturers are staring at us. Let them stare. No one can question me hereafter. Arjun! This is over. Don't think I'll come behind kneeling down and apologizing... ...I'll care a damn about it. Please...hello! One at a time. Anjali Ma'am, you tell us... ...4 years ago did you legally shut Rudra's case? Or is it a cover up operation as mentioned on TV by him? Why did he use your name? Sir, we want Anjali Ma'am to speak. Please wait! Please see... ...as per our norms, an investigating officer can't speak to media. But...but... ...Rudra is dead. That's the truth. Then why is someone taking responsibility for the killings not done by him? I'm not saying that he didn't commit murder. But he's not the Rudra who was responsible for the killings 5 years ago. Sir, doesn't matter if he's Rudra or not... ...but he has challenged another kidnap on TV. What measures has been taken? Will you catch him? The entire city is on alert. Security has been beefed up. There are 105 checkpoints in the city. All the areas have Police surveillance. The kidnapping won't happen today. It is highly impossible. Sir, he's been replying promptly to our questions. We could've asked him directly instead. This meeting is over, thank you. Chief secretary has called me three times... ...and media has made this case a sensational news. We're running out of time. Sir hand over the case to me, I'll get that son of a bitch. No Mr. Gowda, let her do it. Anjali are you sure? That he's not doing this for a ransom. No Sir, that's not his motive. He wants to tease the department. The first time, he made us bring the money in CBI vehicle. Today he's sending group messages during our official press meet. He's doing everything to insult us in front of the media. But Anjali, I'm counting on you. Finish this case sooner, and produce that psycho in court. Sure Sir! Ma'am. Inspector Nageshwar is here. Nageshwar...!? He investigated Vignesh Hegde kidnapping case. Oh yes, yes....come. Inspector Nageshwar Crime Branch Ma'am. Please sit down. You've analyzed the case with great detail and in depth. Very good work, very good work. Every case should be handled the same way Nagesh. Aren't we getting paid for that? Right Ma'am, well said...well said! Coming to the point. I went through your investigation report. May be not to your level... ...but even I've investigated the case in depth. You've mentioned about a threat received on CD. Why didn't you attach that CD? Sorry Ma'am I forgot, I've brought it with me now. Hey...! Idiot, give that to me. NO! Nothing much, nothing much! It's ok, it's ok! It's ok...! I need a ransom of 2 crores. No Police, no Media. Ma'am pause it right there. CD got stuck itself. The player must be broken. But Madam... ...if you close your eyes... ...and listen to that voice... ...it sounds exactly like actor Amitabh Bachchan. So did you call him for an inquiry? Ma'am, his earning are 100 crores a year. Why would he do stuff like this? But just like him on TV and Theater... ...there are 32 mimicry artists who can speak in his voice. I got them all and investigated. Unfortunately, no one was guilty. If you see the scarf he's wearing, it's new. So, he must've bought that a week ago. I went through every platform and shop in the city... ...I rounded up all the scarf retailers... ...and investigated them thoroughly. There were almost 132 of them. 3rd degree treatment. I beat them to pulp. But that was a dead end too. This video has many clues. You were utter foolish with no relevance... ...have picked up innocent people and tortured them. Who gave you guys the right to beat up the public? You can see a small reflection here... ...what's it? News for the deaf and dumb. It comes on air at 6 pm. The time when Vignesh Hegde got kidnapped was 5:15 pm. So, he sent this video from a place which is within 40-45 mins from the golf course. So keeping in mind, main city and the traffic... ...he must've been within 5-7 km radius from there. And look at this. You can see "C O" and the reflection on the window has " I B A" inverted. A big hoarding of IBACO ice-cream. If at all you had some sense, your tiny brain had some knowledge, you could've looked for this hoarding in and around 5-7 km radius... ...and could've caught him the same day. Sorry Ma'am! Now just get out. We'll ask to trace out that location, and look for fingerprints or DNA. Look at that visual. It has plastic covers all over. You won't find any traces. And you know what? I'm telling this on the basis of how he's handling us. He's not a person who will leave such simple clues. His motive is to transfer the case to CBI. He's playing a different game. -Hey! -Hey no...! Hey babes, stop it. -Hey, please just go. -I'll be back. Who's that!? KA - 02 - G 9341...huh! That's right, it's a 5 series. Ok. Ma'am, this is Minister's son Swaroop's car. Shit! Minister is here. Sir, Swaroop is not inside the car. -What happened? -Where's my Son? Sir put it on loud speaker. Minister Sir, your son is inside the boot. -Boot! -Yes Ma'am. Ask them not to open it. -Hey stop! -Why!? Why shouldn't they open it? There are pictures on the back seat. Have a look at them. Ah...Swaroop! High ED bomb! Customized. With utmost care... ...just for your son. I made it with so much care. -Bomb Squad! -On the way Ma'am. Hey...place the barricades. Constables, place the barricades. The bomb is connected to all the sides of the boot. Even if the car moves a bit... ...disturbing the wires... ...200 meter radius. BOOM! Seems like they're here to die. Who are you? Tell me what do you want? Hello! Hello! Let go off my son. Hello! Hey, who the hell are you? Let my son go. Hello! Hello! I don't like foreplay. I'll come straight to the point. Heard that you just received a hot delivery of 1000 crores. I saw 4 of them ranting about it on TV yesterday. No, it's all a lie. I've filed a character assassination suit on them. They're all terrorists. Ooooh! Locking up stating they're terrorist, if they stand up for justice, is not fair. Fine, let that go. All I need is just 2 crores. Don't get baffled with 2 crores. Just 'cause your son had a desire, with an Hindi actress... ...father and son had a gala time on a private jet costing 5 crores. If you can spend 5 crores for your son's desire... ...it's just 2 crores for his life. Not a big deal. Fine, when do you want it? Where should I come? No Sir, you don't come. You're a Type-2 diabetes patient. Moreover, you've gone under a bypass surgery. I want someone who plays better. Anjali!? Let Anjali bring the cash. She's been waiting to meet me. I'll meet her face-to-face... ...and get the cash. I'll get back on where and when in sometime. Go to Kundan brother's house and get 2 crores. Get going. Calm down. Anjali! You shouldn't take any action. It's enough if you just make the drop where he asks to. I want my son back safe and sound. Ok Sir. How did media get a whiff of this? It was him who had sent the message. Ok, this is the plan. I'll get the cash and come alone in my car. All you 8 go ahead of me and watch that place. I'm sure he'll ask to meet at a crowded place. I want to know who is he? We're going to meet exactly in another 20 minutes. How do you feel about it? I'm pretty excited. I'm excited too! Leave! Cubbon Park Metro Station. Keep watching. No matter what happens don't act without my orders. -Rachel!? -Yes Ma'am. Stay alert! Track that GPS and follow it. -Keep me updated. -Ok Ma'am. I know you're restless to meet me. But what gives you the right to violate the queue? Get in the queue just like anyone else. Like that! There was a tantric hyena in the forest. You know what's an hyena right? Hyena! That... ...loves to show the lion as a dummy by insulting it. Don't we look more like the lion and the hyena? Hey, did you hear that? It beeped. Madam put your bag inside. Stop! Why is it beeping again? Surrender everything Anjali. Oh...weapons! She's a senior officer, ask them to let her go. Main gate security, she's a Senior Officer, let her go. Sorry Madam. Keep walking. Anjali. Did you get any instructions? Come to the end of platform no. 2. Anjali can you hear me? Anjali!? Anjali! Let's get back to our story. -Anjali can you hear me? -Usually... -...lion and the hyena don't get along. -Anjali. Do you know why? This hyena... ...always has an eye on lion's prey and pride. Lion sits back and meticulously plans, targets its prey and hunts it down. Bringing down all his hard work, that hyena will conspire something and take away his prey. Lion always longed for the hyena to get tangled and die one day. Like...! 1...2...3 7...and 8! Hyena kept repeating this. The fear and respect which the lion had... ...in the forest, started to recede. You know what? In that, the hyena... ...found innate joy. And then came the D-Day. Finally, met face-to-face. And that day finally arrived. As the time came closer... ...thinking of what will happen finally... ...the entire forest was in jitters. Isn't it interesting? Uh!? Now stop! Get inside the train. Where are you? I'm waiting at the first compartment. Come fast! Faster. Faster! Faster! Get down with the bag. What!? I said get down. Now! -Ma'am. -Madam. -This door, this door... -Hey! Shit! Shit. So sad! Ma'am, where...? Ma'am! Anjali! Shit! Ready!? Time to meet. What happened? Power is down Ma'am. Will be back immediately. Power maintenance!? Hello check the location. My God! Hi Anjali. Rudra! Cash!? See you soon. Damn! Rachel! Rachel! Key. Don't waste time, give me your gun. -You track down the GPS. -Yes Ma'am. Ask the team to get down at the next station. Follow him, I want him at any cost. Yes ma'am! Sir, I made the drop. Did he mention anything else? When will he diffuse the bomb? He didn't mention anything. My only son... ...he has made him an exhibit of a game in front of everyone. Can't you guys do anything about it? Go straight, go...go. Ah...left...left. Ok stop. Stop! He's coming this way. He's within 500 meters of distance. Hold fire. Minister Sir, cash received with thanks. I've diffused the bomb. Anjali, Anjali wait. Hey, don't play with me. Where's my son? I've given what you had demanded for. Sorry Sir, I made a mistake in telling which car he's in. Your son is inside the boot of Anjali's car. Ah...! Swaroop! Look here, my son Swaroop...! What happened? Is he safe? Hey, if you had demanded for more, I would've given it you. He's my only son. What!? Anjali look what have you done? He was alive, when I put him inside your car. He was struggling and you took him around the city. At least be alert the next time. You're dealing with lives. Sir is the one who is going through loss now. Apologize to Sir. Sir, this is not my fault. Don't add this death to my body count. Sir! He has escaped. I'm speaking to the Home Minister right away. She shouldn't be part of any department. This department doesn't require an incapable officer like you. -Sir. -Swaroop! Sir, please Sir. Sir! One minute! Ma'am we have to cease your car... ...give me the keys. Madam one minute... ...there has been 3 murders now. You're not saying; is there no solution to this? For God's sake please give me an answer. Madam, are you going to answer or not? What's happening? Arjun! Hey! Arjun. What's wrong with you? I've cleared my exams. You've failed in three subjects. One year is totally wasted. Why are you behaving like a walking dead? This is not right Arjun. You've been trying to call her forever... ...if she loves you, she must've spoken to you. At least would've replied to a message. Keep this in mind, she has a clear track going on... ...but you're here like a mental. Don't talk unnecessarily. You think I'm blabbering? Look. Movie with Krithi! Coffee with Krithi! Driving with Krithi! Their life seems to be fun. But you've shut yourself from everyone, haven't been attending your sister's calls, behaving like a lunatic. What's your problem? I've been ranting like a fool and you...! The Vodafone number you've dialed is busy at the moment. Please call back later. Tell me Arjun... ...where's Krithi? We've come down for Anusha's wedding. Where!? Bangalore. When will you guys return? It must at least take a week, Arjun. Fine, let's leave. Where to? Bangalore! Hey! I have to go. Just once, one last time. Did she leave, 'cause she didn't like me? Or did she leave 'cause she liked someone else? Will swear my heart out. I'll break all ties with her and return. Please trust me Vinoth. Ok let's go. I'll ask Vetri to come. What is the issue between you guys? Everything was going fine. Who's that Surya? Where the hell did he come from? He didn't crop up out of nowhere. He was always with her right from the beginning. Here...this is Surya. Model it seems. Saree is really beautiful. -You too dear. -Thanks. Uncle! Ya right! Everything! Looks beautiful. Thanks bro. Why does a saree ad, requires a wedding chain? That can happen. Bro! How many times do you think you would've got married? Hey, look at him shy away. Surya you must try this. Enough! -Just try once. -Ok fine, give it. Try! Oi...hey...come in. Sit down! Krithi come over here, come, come... What's up bro, seems like you're very busy. Did you eat? Shall we share? Ya, hey Ju come on, let's eat. -I'll serve you guys. -Hey! Machan! This ad of yours, I watched it yesterday. Damn! I should say this, you have an amazing figure. Hey Surya, stop it. -Hmmm! -Surya! Hey. Shall I stay outside? Sorry, sorry ok!? Ummm...hey I wanted to ask one thing. Hey Krithi! Hey...Hi! It's been ages since we met. -Hey! -Hi. By the way, I saw your new ad... ...you and Surya were great. -Lovely pair! -Thanks. Where's Surya? Surya....? Off late you're only seen with Surya. Hey! Is he your...brother!? Oh no...! Ah...one sec. -Hi Ju! -Where are you? I'm at the shoot. When will you be done? It might go until 2 am in the night. Fine, I'll come and pick you. No it's fine, you carry on. I'll ask Surya to drop me. Surya doesn't have to drop you. Ok, ok Ju...I have to go, bye. Hello! Hello! Damn! I'm not such a low life. Why should I go through someone else's profile? It's my girlfriend... ...will listen to me. I'm not here to fight. I've come to talk and convince her... ...I was pacifying myself. Can't take this anymore. Shit! How can I not get angry beyond this? -Ju...! -Hmmm. Surya said bye, but you didn't respond. I didn't. Fine, where are we going? -Ah...Krithi. -Huh!? Are you serious about it? This modeling... ...and stuff. Why do you ask? It's going fine. No... ...not that. You can do something else, something more interesting and creative. Don't you feel awkward about this? Awkward as in? I didn't mean it in the wrong way... ...why do you have to struggle so much? Late night shoots, without proper sleep... ...working with strangers, and moving around with them. Come to the point. Don't you trust me? How can I say that I have doubts? But can say it's the fear of her leaving me. It can be possessiveness too. Can also say it's love. Fine, chuck it! I got something for you. Open it. I was scared that you might buy this yourself. I wanted to gift you this with my hard earned money. Is the color fine with you? Huggy!? I don't require anyone. It's enough if you're just by my side. So he's your problem. I told you the other day as well, he's just a friend. Wait. -Ah...tell me. -Hello Krithi. Hello! It's not that I have to say this for you to understand. I'm very irritated since I dropped you back there with him. His looks and personality... ...you know what's happening between us right? I Love You damn it! Don't fall in love 'O' my heart, don't fall in love Then don't hang yourself in the name of love. Don't fall in love 'O' my heart, don't fall in love Then don't hang yourself in the name of love. Making every stray as her friend... ...she cremated the true love. Mamey! Making every stray as her friend... ...she cremated the true love. When it was just us, the love was divine Just then came a joker in the guise of her friend. If I get a hold him, he will be John Doe. I'm a very cool person, don't turn into a monster. It's really hard to get a girl But one day you'll get a hot chick, definitely the day will come. If you flirt with someone else's girl... ...then definitely everyone will flirt with your girl. She never let me, never let me sleep She kept flirting throughout the night and didn't let me sleep. She never let me get through, never let me get through She never let me get through the exams. Don't fall in love 'O' my heart, don't fall in love Then don't hang yourself in the name of love. Don't fall in love 'O' my heart, don't fall in love Then don't hang yourself in the name of love. Hit it! Drop it! Hit it Hit it on the dance floor. Hit it Drop it. Hit it on the dance floor. Love which bloomed sitting near the sea Has become a prey to Tinder on internet. Unknown guys these days Have become the flirtatious friends. What's happening, it's all an illusion. Anyone and everyone has been hugging you. It's hurting a bit, my heart is drunk Oh damn, you're great at acting She never let me, never let me sleep She kept flirting throughout the night and didn't let me sleep. She never let me get through, never let me get through She never let me get through the exams. Hit it! Drop it! Ju! Arjun, I didn't do anything wrong. Don't say a word. It's irritating to hear your voice. Surya is my school friend. I was just friends with him. I never expected that he'll propose to me. I seriously don't understand this logic. You guys will go around with a guy, will speak to him well. You'll tease him to the core. But when they come and propose... ...how is it fair to say, that you didn't expect it? If you guys continue this, anyone will think it's love. And will definitely propose. Arjun, I'm not responsible for that. I've told him clearly that I love you. He's fine with it, and said...let's be friends. So he said...let's be friends? Hmmm...ok, ok. So no matter what happens between you guys, you'll consider that as friendship. Am I right!? Arjun you're losing it. You're degrading me. I'm a cheap guy. If decency is staying silent looking at everything, then I'm not that decent guy. I'm a cheap guy. I should've given a thought earlier. Just like your mother, even you can't stay loyal. Arjun! This is over. I can't get through a break-up. Also, you know that I can't be without talking to you. But I'm saying this now... ...I don't want to hate you. These two years... ...are the best memories of my life. That shouldn't tarnish 'cause of this day. No matter what happens, even if you change your mind, I won't come back to you Arjun. Bye! Krithi! Krithi! Don't think I'll come behind kneeling down and apologizing. I'll care a damn about it. What's this? I've been looking for you at the school. You've started your antics once seeing your uncle? What are you doing here? What was so important, that you didn't inform at home. Hey, I'm speaking to you. He broke up with Krithika. He's here to meet her. Won't he speak for himself? Doesn't attend my calls. What's your problem? Keep thinking about the past. Can't I warn you for drunk driving, being a CBI officer? Is that a crime? You should've stopped with a warning. Why did you slap me in front of everyone? I didn't slap a stranger. I slapped you as a rightful sister. I've seen many death cases due to drunk driving. Anjali, the other day it was an emergency at the hospital. We were drunk and without a choice, he had to drive that night. He has never done that before, not even once. Ok fine, I'm sorry. You can't stay without talking to your friends even for few years. But when you get a girl married... ...you don't seem to bother at all. For twenty one years, parents and siblings are her life. How can she forget them all together, and stay without talking to them. I'm really sorry to have slapped you. Don't stop talking to me. Come on Shalini. Anjali. What about me? Me...Me...Me...Me...! If you start suspecting for petty things, no one will seem like a good person to you, in this world. Meet Krithika and then come home. Bye-Bye! Check! Hey, let's get ready and leave for Anusha's wedding. What about me? Just a minute. -This voice note should reach Anjali. -I'm watching, Anbuarasu. Anyways, you will keep repeating this telecast. Ok. Tonight the entire CBI will not sleep. Be ready to run around without sleep. The time now is 8:10 pm. In exactly an hour... ...I'll kidnap my next target. We'll end our game with this. This audio threat from Rudra... Hello Anbuarasan, we have only 55 minutes left. Alert all check posts. I'll be at cyber cell in 10 mins. Assemble the team. Ma'am what are we going to do? We have 40 mins left from the time he mentioned. So in sometime, from him to some number... ...asking ransom or a threat... ...an untraceable internet call is about to come. We won't be able to trace him. But that untraceable call... ...and the ones who answer that call can be traced. If we can crack that sooner, at least we can stop his next move. Just get me that call...please. Anbuarasan, if Police gets a missing report... -...ask them to inform us immediately. -Ok Ma'am. Ma'am I got a call. What number is it? And the location? It's a land-line number Sir, Frazer Town. Hello can you answer me? You're on my nerve man, please...please. Ma'am I got another call. Hello! I too got a call. Ma'am not just three... ...from that unknown network, there 213 calls active at the moment. Calls are getting multiplied every second. He's doing automatic call generation. Play all the calls. -Who's speaking? -Hello...who's this? -Who the hell are you? -What's happening? -Say something... -Hello! Don't you have the courtesy to speak? Are you jobless? This is crazy, say something... ...damn it! Sir! Krithika Rao! Hotelier Gokulnath's only daughter. She's from Chennai, has come down for a wedding. And this is her photo. He kidnapped her from Royal Eagle Club. Krithika's mobile is switched off. Her father's Secretary Mr. Sunil has got the ransom call. The same 2 crores. He has asked him to come to Town Hall junction at 5:30 am in the morning. Oh damn! One team go to that club immediately. See if you can get some clue there. Try to track the location quickly. I'm auto-generating blank messages to Krithika's number. The minute phone's switched on, we'll know her location. Mr. Sunil is on his way here. No, ask him not to come here. Media is all over this place. Even a small news will disrupt our course of action. Get all the details from him over the phone. And ask him to follow our instructions. Let it be very confidential. Hmmm...ok! Hello, hold on, just a minute. Hello! Hello, where are you guys? Anjali, we're here at Royal Eagle Club 'cause Arjun called so... ...but when we got here, the place was swarmed with Police. Why did he go there? He came here to meet Krithika. Now where's he? No idea Anjali, we're looking for him as well. Vinoth, if he calls please inform me right away. Definitely I'll call you Anjali. I'm at Royal Eagle Club. Around 9 pm when the reception was happening... ...it started with flood lights bursting out one by one. The guests who had come, left the place in fear. Also, we heard that CBI officials were here a while ago. When we asked the Club Manager about this, exactly the same time when the incident happened... ...the CCTV cameras were jammed. It is said that this might be the work of Rudra's next kidnapping. CBI has to reply to this. He's in the headlines again... ...Home Minister has been calling me profusely. There's only an hour left for 5:30 am. What's the plan? What would Anjali plan this time? What will I do, if I'm in your situation? Ramesh, Tharun and I... ...have met DIG and The Collector. And after explaining them the situation... ...we've got this. You would've got a shooting order. What else? The genius Anjali, have lost to me twice. What else can you do? No other option, we have to do this. Ask our entire team to be on surveillance there. I want everyone armed. I've asked for Snipers too. Without creating a panic... ...after my orders and if you get a clear shot, just take the shot. After an hour... ...the so called fucking son of a bitch Rudra, will be no more. So no more...Rudra! Rudra's Game! Are you going to kill me Anjali? How can we do this? Morning 5:30 am will be crowded. -Let's leave. -Everyone will be walking. Damn! Excuse me Ma'am, just a minute. Rudra has been live streaming a video. What!? There, on the main screen. Oh my God! Help! Help! HELP! Ma'am, he has sent an audio clip. Play it. Sir! Hi Anjali, it's Rudra. How's the feeling of being fooled every time, Anjali? You know what... ...this tank will fill up in next 45 minutes. She'll drown into it, suffocate and die. I'm going to pick up the money in another half an hour. If you don't bother me... ...and let me do my job... ...I'll come back, switch off the motor and save her life. Anjali, you're planning to end a life... ...but I'm trying to save one life. Please... ...understand Anjali. Anjali, we have to abort the mission. Just like before, what if we go trying to nab him... ...and he kills that girl? So, he'll kidnap... ...threaten with a ransom. Do you want CBI to stand down? If we don't take action fearing him, few more will crop up just like him. First, let's secure that girl. Then we'll get to the encounter. Ok. One team proceed with the encounter plan. Another team headed by Gowda Sir will go for the girl. How do we go for the girl? I've got a plan. Sir, not in East Bangalore. Then ask them to try West Bangalore. It's not East Bangalore, shut down West Bangalore immediately. Sir, it's not West Bangalore either. Start trying North Bangalore. Take positions. -Hold on, one second. -Where's this location? Sir, this is Central Bangalore. There are 13 power stations under Central Bangalore. Rachel, you be right here and keep updating me. -I'll get to the location. -Ok Sir. Hello, lock Central Bangalore. Shutdown each sub station and then switch it on. Ma'am! Zone has been locked. It's Central Bangalore. But Ma'am, there are a lot of hospitals in that area. We can't totally shut them down. We have to do it one by one, Ma'am. Ask the photographers to be ready. Rachel I've reached the Central Zone. What's the status? Sir, we've checked until 6th sector. Nothing so far, we're checking the 7th sector now. Ma'am, he has received a call. Do you see a Police booth out there? Keep the suitcase inside it. -Guys. -Ma'am. -All eyes on Police booth. -Yes Ma'am. Hold, which location is this? Sir, 9th Sector... ...16-17-18th main road, Indira Nagar. -Main road, Indira Nagar. Go...go faster. Keep the 9th sector power down. Ok, hey...keep this one shut down. Ma'am, someone has opened the Police booth. Do you have a clear view? Can you spot his face on any visual? He's wearing a black shirt. Face is not clear, it's quite blurry. Sir, have you spotted the location? Just entering, Anjali. Rachel, switch on the power. No, hold fire. Just reached the terrace. Sir, tank is filled with blood. -Careful...careful. -Be careful. Careful! Anjali, I don't think she's alive. What!? She lost a lot of blood, she's unconscious. She isn't breathing at all. Now just go ahead and shoot him. Ma'am! Arjun. Arjun! Arjun! GAME OVER! Following a series of power-cuts in various parts of the city, a CBI operation was carried out last night. Near the Town Hall junction. Headed by SP-CBI Anjali Vikramadityan. Where an anonymous guy has been shot down. He has been admitted here at the Govt. Medical College Hospital. Who is in charge of this case? The suspect is yet to be revealed by the CBI. -Doctor! -Hmmm. Bullets have been removed. There's nothing to worry. Let him be at the Post-Op ward for 2 hours... ...then he can be shifted to General Ward. And...this was inside his pocket. Thank you, Doctor. -Anbuarasan. -Ma'am! -Check what's this? -Ok Ma'am. Come on. Why did Arjun come to pick up the money with no relevance? What happened last night? Anjali, he had gone to meet Krithika last night. We have no idea what happened out there. He mentioned about getting a drink, and asked me to pick him up in an hour. Krithika was kidnapped from that club. Then Arjun must've been with her too. I'm sure both would've seen Rudra. Once Arjun regains consciousness... ...we will get answers to all the questions. Ma'am! Narayan Sir is on the phone. Hello! Anjali can you please come to Royal Eagle club? What's it about? You come here, will let you know. Take care of him, I'll be back. Come in Anjali. What's it Sir? Any leads? Hmmm! I've checked all the footage. Your brother was here for an hour and half. But beyond 9 pm, no actions of him has been captured on the camera. Sir, as it was an VIP's wedding... ...we gave permission to use our extended lawn as drinks area. There are no cameras in that area. It's a possibility he was there. Security. Tell us where and when you saw him. Ma'am when the first light got busted... ...I saw him at the club's main gate. He seemed really tensed. Rewind to when the first light got busted. Stop! Play it from here. Play the main gate visual on this monitor as mentioned by the security. Pause. When the first light got busted... ...is when the security saw Arjun. Ma'am how did the cameras got jammed when your brother crossed them. Post that wherever Arjun had passed... ...cameras were jammed. Fine, what are you getting at? Over here. We recovered Krithika's body from the water tank on top of this building. This building was sealed by Govt. There are no houses in the surrounding. Neither there are any eye witnesses. In this room... ...there are someone's fingerprints and DNA... ...forensic reports have stated it. When we analyzed them... ...it matched with Arjun's DNA and fingerprints. What nonsense? How's that possible? How did they confirm it was Arjun's DNA sample? Please come. Do you recognize whose car is this? Arjun's wallet inside the car... ...hair strands... ...fingerprints and DNA samples taken from them... ...is an exact match with the samples recovered from that room. No Sir, there's some confusion in this. Just a minute, I'm not finished yet. Open that boot. I've verified the numbers on the currency. Rudra, right from the beginning... ...that is Arjun. Took this money as ransom. Not only that, we were always wondering about the cameras getting jammed. This is a UV 30 VHF CCTV jammer Ma'am. That's attached to this car battery. If we switch on this jammer... ...any camera within 100 meters of its vicinity... ...can be jammed by just one remote control. And... ...this is the remote Anjali. How did this land in Arjun's pocket? How did this car get here? I'm convinced, Arjun is Rudra. Sir, if that's the case, three kidnappings from before... ...you should prove that Arjun was in Bangalore. I've already inquired about it. There isn't any proof of him being at Chennai at the same time. Court demands proof. Bills, credit card usage, phones, there isn't any proof to support it. So, we got our Rudra. I've asked to file a charge sheet. Once Arjun regains consciousness, we will arrest him and start the investigation. Excuse me Sir! This is my case. I'll decide about charge sheet and other stuff. Hey...hey Arjun. Arjun where are you going? Sit down, sit down! I've been sitting all day. What's it? Krithi... Krithika! She's fine right? They saved her right? How is she now? Hey! We couldn't see her. Krithika is very much alive. But... But!? Hey, she's fine. You don't have to worry. Nothing's wrong. But...what happened? Vetri!? I have to see her. I want to see her right away. She's at New Victorian Hospital. But you can't meet her now. Why...why!? Please understand the situation. There's Police outside. Also, there's heavy Police protection. Be calm for a while. Why were you there instead of Rudra to pick up the money? Huh!? What exactly happened there? -I shouldn't have spoken that way. -Oh...! I know, that it was my mistake. Oh....! Ah...ah...ah! I spoke too much out of rage. Don't know how I'll face and speak to her anymore. Don't piss me off, damn it. You've been ranting this nonsense repeatedly. Did a mistake for taking your word and coming down to Bangalore. Hold on a second. Sir! Main gate is crowded, please use Gate 3. Fine, then say what should I do? I don't care what you do. But if you comeback and continue to have a long face... ...I'll beat myself up. Hey give me that phone... -Hello!? -Give me moment, I'll call you back. Hey, just wait... -Hello, who is this? -It's me. Hey, Jenny just called... ...she spoke to Kriithika it seems. Asked to meet her at the party area. Party Area.... Are you going to say something? Or shall I leave? You better leave Krithi. I'm not able to say, what I wanted to. I'm out of words. I wanted to scream and fight with you, also I came here to say that I don't need you anymore. But when I saw you... Do you know what everyone is saying? That you're committed with someone. Have moved on... ...you would've believed it right away. You are well aware, that I can't stay loyal to one guy. Krithi, I said that in rage. I still regret saying that. You're so close to me. But feels like you're miles away. It feels really weird. I'm scared. You broke ties for a petty thing. That's not a petty thing Arjun. It's not easy to forget you. The places we visited, words spoken by you... ...the gifts. Not only that, I stayed silent in order to forget you. Even that silence reminds me of you. I'm...I'm sorry Krithi. Don't! Let's end this for good. If I continue to speak a bit longer... ...I might change my mind, hug you and cry. That's how much I still love you and miss you. Bye! Love which listens to the heart, can't obey to anything else. Love which demands utmost care, can't bear being questioned its loyalty. It's not a smooth ride when it comes to love. Without separation you can't gauge the depth of love. If I continue to speak a bit longer... ...I might change my mind, hug you and cry. Love is like that sky, That's how much I still love you and miss you. But tears are like those rain clouds, it can't stay without a downpour. Jenny where's Krithi? She saw your message and left to meet you. To see me...!? So!? Have you guys patched up? Not sure. Fine, then go and get her. Krithi! Krithi! They're being atrocious. Krithi! Krithi! Krithi! Krithi! Krithi! Hello! Can you please have a look at the TV? This tank will fill up in the next 45 minutes. She'll drown into it, suffocate and die. You might be able to save her. I have to see Krithi. Hey...hey, Arjun. Hey Arjun! Hey...Hey! Arjun who was shot down near Town Hall... ...is a Chennai based MBBS graduate. We got all the evidence indicating that he's Rudra. We've seized his car. Along with the entire ransom money and the CCTV jammer. Soon, we will produce him with all conclusive evidence to the court. Sir, what's the condition of that girl? Did that girl give any statement? She's in a very critical stage. She's not in a state to give a statement. But that girl's dying declaration... ...will be a very crucial evidence. Sir, they're saying he's Anjali's younger brother. How can I trust that it will be a fair investigation? Anjali is under suspension. I'm handling this case at the moment. -Why did they suspend Anjali? -Please, thank you very much. Hey, that's him. Come on run, run, run... Arjun, something is not right. They're trying to frame you. Ey...he's right here. Get to the hospital where Krithika is admitted. I'll be there soon. Hey, stop right there. Don't run. Hey, lock that gate. Last night Rudra a.k.a Arjun Prabhakar who was arrested, is said to have escaped from the Police custody. It's said that he's been scheming such murders and kidnapping for very long time. Anjali what happened to Arjun? They're saying nonsense on TV about him. Don't be scared, Mom. You definitely have to do that. -Shalu get inside. -Come dear. Hold on, I'll call you back. -Sir hold on, I'll call you back. -Ma'am...! Disconnect land-line and internet connection. Nothing should get out of this room. What happened Anjali? Scared that I might do something in favour of Arjun, so they've kept me on house arrest by Magistrate's order. What nonsense! You wait here, I'll go and meet our lawyer. Dad! Nothing should happen to Arjun. There's a shooting order in place. We have to first stop that. I'll see through it. Sir... ...where are you headed? You guys are on house arrest. -Me too!? -Ya! Is my name in your order? I have every right to go, where ever I want. Sir is trying to reason here. Ma'am if you give your phone... ...it'll be great. Does your mother has a phone? No I believe. Doctor you must be... Did you guys monitor patient Krithika's plateau pressure? Did pulmonary medicine mention any indication of ARDS? How long has been F1 on 2.6? Useless! Call the attender. Please call their attender. He's asking things which we're not aware of. Wait, let me check. Sister, who was that? He's the Cardiologist. Please send her to ICU immediately. Arjun! How come you're here? I saw the news on TV. What's happening Arjun? I don't understand any of it Jenny. Who's he? Why is he doing this? Why her!? Why did he do this to her? Doctors after going through all the reports, are stating that Krithika will survive this. Aren't her parents here? We're not able to reach her father. His secretary is taking care of everything. You stated that I'm the only one for you. Even to me, it's just you. Don't leave me behind. I can't be without you, even for a second. Even if it's not for her, at least to save you. Krithi will come back to life. She will confirm in her statement that you're not Rudra. Hello. -Is Arjun there? -Yes. -Arjun! -Huh!? It's Anjali. Arjun listen to me... ...you shouldn't be running, first surrender yourself. First, you get out from there. Why should I surrender for a crime which I didn't commit. Who's Rudra? Why is he doing this? I don't understand any of this. I'm in a very sticky situation too. Nothing will happen to Krithika. Listen to what I'm saying. You shouldn't be running. She started crying, when she met me. She said that she can't forget me. He beat her up to bleed and had put her in the car. I was destroyed looking at her. Arjun I can understand what's going on with you. CBI has a shooting order issued. Anything can happen to you. I don't care what happens to me. I don't mind even If I die. A minute before I die... ...he should die. Arjun! Hello! What's this nonsense damn it? In such a big city, Police and CBI couldn't find Rudra... ...how do you think, that we can find him? I can find him. They haven't seen Rudra. But I've seen him. I've seen him in flesh and blood. Did you see his face? Then!? How are you going to find him? I've been thinking about it. That money, jammer... ...how did that land up in my car? Krithika said that she was going to meet me, why didn't she pick up my call when I called her? I don't understand what's happening. Hey hold on a minute. From whose number did you call me yesterday? I called you from my number. Not the first call, the second one was not from your number. Hey it was from my... -Hello who is this? -It's me. I thought your phone was dead. Hold on for a moment, I'll call you back. Jenny where is Krithi? She saw your message and left to meet you. He was right there. Ask him to go to Royal Eagle Club. Brother, go to Madivala Royal Eagle Club. Quick! I shouldn't have spoken that way. I know, that it was my mistake. Sir! Main gate is crowded, please use Gate 3. Hey, what are you looking for? Hey! There are no CCTV cameras here. He knew it, and had diverted me into this direction and followed. If so, he would've put that jammer remote inside your pocket right here. I don't think so. I was looking for a lighter, before speaking to Krithika. There was nothing inside my pocket then. That means, he followed me after. We have to check the footage of this camera. Hey! Who are you guys? Hey, come on this way. Where are you guys going? Stop. Got it! It's restoring. Camera....24! Do you remember the time you and Krithika were at this spot? Must be around 8:45-9 pm. 8:45 - 9:00 PM Stop! That's him. That's definitely him. But his face is not seen clearly. Forward it a bit. His face is not clear on any camera. He must've been here quite a few times. He's well aware of where the cameras are. Stop. If we get hold of him... ...we can find him. Now, where do we find him? Hey...hey! Who are you guys? And what do you want? What are you doing here? Hey, aren't you Arjun? Who's that guy? Who's that guy? What's it? There are three ladies in this house. You're coming here often and harassing them. Don't you have manners? Three ladies uh? Where!? Oh, then you must be blind. Then go and beg at traffic signal. What the hell do you want? I want a signature from Ma'am. I don't know how to sign... ...get out from here. Did she consider herself as Ma'am. Shalu wait. Wait here..Ssssh! -What's it? -Have to complete the procedure. -I need your signature. -Hmmm...I'll come. Mom, please take care of her. She doesn't listen. Shalu dear, please wait here. Shalu...Shalu, please listen. Shalu...! At least teach your kid some manners. She talks exactly like you. I'm the mightiest... ...and the only genius. If you take too much pride, they will make a fool of you. Please keep feeding her that wisdom. Ma'am I have a doubt. What does CBI officers think of themselves? Just 'cause I didn't handle the case right... ...you had slapped me. He was right in front of you. Just like his pet dog, you followed his instructions. You couldn't do anything about it. Just like you, even we... ...have the same 1300 gm of brain. If at all you had used at least a bit from it, there's no reason for the case to get transferred to CBI. You let the prime suspect go, you went behind small vendors on the street beggars... ...how will it help beating them up? What can I say. When it comes to you, you can only show your prowess to these helpless people. Ma'am mind your words. I have hands too. Will raise them on you. I won't spare 'cause you're a woman. Heyyy! Come on raise your hand, come on... -Hold her down. -Put that down. Why don't you give it a try? Will raise his hands it seems. Bloody baldy, will twinge you damn it. Shouldn't disrespect elders. You shut up. What are you looking at? What are you looking at? Last warning! If you say something again... Shalu...! Ma'am...! You've raised your child just the way it should be. Sit down Nagesh. I agree It was wrong to have slapped you. But my anger was right. What's so joyous about me losing? It's not only me... ...it's joy to the entire Police Department. Regardless of which case it is, only the Police officer, will get down to it's core. Will collect all the evidence... ...inquire all the witnesses. Finally, when he's about to crack the case... ...he will be accused of not handling it right. Inefficient and it needs a CBI probe. Then the case is transferred to your department. Not only you crack the case... ...you take the entire credit and fame pertaining to it. Our hard-work is in there too. Lion sits back and meticulously plans. Targets its prey and hunts it down. Bringing down all his hard work, that Hyena will conspire something and take away his prey. They change the posting of the officer who handled the case, is also being suspended from duty. Due to that, he faces a lot of humility. Hyena keeps repeating this. The fear and respect which the Lion had... ...in the forest starts to recede. Including me, many other officers have been affected by CBI. It's obvious that we will be angry when it comes to you people. 4 Years ago, who was the first Police officer to handle Rudra's case? Martin Sir! Which Martin? Assistant Commissioner Martin Roy, Ma'am. He was from Bombay Crime Detection unit, officially 34 encounters. There's no count to unofficial encounters. An officer who was feared by the underworld of Bombay. There are plenty cases of Human Rights filed on him. Killing someone is an addiction to him. If you ask someone about Dareti area in Mumbai, everyone will be aware of it. In Bangalore, December 2012... ...he joined as ACP. In just 3 months, 8 encounters. The rest who were left out, no one has an idea where they went. Even we were scared to talk to him. He was rewarded the name "TOP COP" of the state. 4 years ago, he handled the case of Rudra. As he was not able to crack the case, they suspended him... ...and transferred the case to CBI. Moreover, you cracked the case very soon. The media which praised him all the time, started to speak indifferently. He quit, 'cause he was suspended. Where's he now? No idea. When was the last time you met him? An year and a half back at his wife's funeral. He use to roar like a lion. It was very sad to see him like that. After that I had tried a lot, but no idea what had happened to him. Hey... ...these pictures are very old. Give me your phone. Tell me Vinoth. -This is Arjun speaking. -Tell me. I've sent a picture to you... ...that's Rudra. Are you sure? He might come to the hospital to kill Krithika. She's the sole witness who has seen him. You be next to her. -Ok!? -Huh! I'll try to get this message to Anjali. Ok, fine. -Tell me Nagesh. -This is Anjali. Tell me. Immediately, I need all the information on EX-ACP Martin Roy. His official connections, and details of his recent activities. What's it? A small hunch. Just track him down fast and let me know. Hey, he's right here... ...I just saw him a while ago. Are you sure about it? I just saw him near the elevator... ...just a minute ago. Hey Vetri... ...no matter what happens, don't let him near Krithika. How many guards are posted near Krithika? I think around 2-3 guards are posted. You get here soon. Hey...what happened? Hey! Hey, stop right there! Ey! So, now you guys have found my house. It's ok....! It's ok! Ok baby, Ok. It's ok! Hmmm....Martin Sir!? Narayan. I was going to meet you myself. I'm handling that Rudra's case at the moment. I need to discuss the details of that old case. I wasn't able to reach you. So nice that I met you here. Are you here for check-up? Sir, that recent victim Krithika is admitted here. Come on, let's see how's she doing and then we'll leave. Ok! Sure! How long it's been since he got in? Where's he now? You two stay right here. Are there guards downstairs? -Sir! -Hmmm. -What happened? -Rudra is right here. He has entered into the hospital. Bloody hell, ask them to beef up the security. Yes Sir! -Mr. Ranjith! -Yes Sir! -You do one thing. -Sir. Get to the CCTV room of the hospital right away. Ok! Check on which floor he is... Look here, you're doing a wrong thing, listen to me. Hey...open the door. Open the door, I say. No! No! Open the door! Stop him. Someone stop him. Shouldn't let him harm that girl. Open the door. No...! Fast, fast...open. Sir, he's going downstairs. Sir, I think he's on the 4th floor. Ask to seal all the gates. Sir! He shouldn't escape from this hospital. No one should get in or out without my permission. Ok Sir! At least post 20 policemen as guard over here. -Understood!? -Sir! Smart! Look if he's out there. Search over there...you go straight. Did you see the guy in this picture? Why did you do this to Krithika? You've been following me for a year and a half. What's your problem with me, that you've gone to this extent. Sister is in CBI and the younger brother is a murderer. Isn't this great? Sister who's determined to kill Rudra... ...wonder how much it will hurt if that is her brother. Anjali should get hurt... ...Rudra! Who the hell is Rudra? Who the hell is Rudra!? Hey kiddo, be careful. You might slit your wrist. I might be a kid, but I've found that you're Rudra. Martin! CBI, Police... ...no one could even remotely come closer to me. But you did it. Tell me... ...what else did you find out about me? I've found out a lot. You're an inefficient Police Officer who couldn't crack Rudra's case. "Inefficient Police Officer" You're a coward who quit his job due to humiliation. Just 'cause Anjali cracked the case which you weren't able to... ...in order to damage her reputation, you're pretending to be Rudra. You're a psycho who his killing in that pretense. Psycho...! Not bad. But are you aware of the fact? Rudra isn't dead yet. I swear. I had almost cracked the case. I was that close. When you're all decked up and made to sit at the altar, and when you're about to say "I Do"... ...they spit on your face, and get that girl married to someone else. Imagine how would it feel? I just felt the same. About your sister's entry into the case. That is Hyena’s entry. So what I was not on duty. I decided to crack the case, before she does. Three murders. One pattern, same method, perfectly executed. I went crazy over that case. When I looked closely where I missed it and what I missed to check out... ...all the evidences pointed towards their friend. Created a doubt on Dr. Vineeth. I went looking for him at his place. Help! Help! It's a 2 acre farm house. Vineeth must be inside the bungalow at the center. There are 4 exits to this farm house. Surround him from all 4 sides. And at any cost, I want him alive. Drop the gun. I said drop your weapon. Anbuarasan Sir, are you ok? -Ok Ma'am. -Please take him. Yes Ma'am! Check if someone else is out here. Be careful. Not just one, two or three... ...murdered 4 of them. The sensational serial killer... ...is your very own sister. Anjali Vikramadithyan IPS. The original Rudra. We're just dummies. For fame and promotion, gathered evidence which wasn't true. Made everyone believe that murderer was someone else. Finally she herself cracked the case, and made everyone a fool in the process. She must be extremely genius. That genius... ...I decided to give her the same pain and humiliation. All this came to the knowledge... ...of my wife, and she tried stopping me. So first I killed her. Just like Anjali, I killed 3 people... ...and framed the brother in the process. Imagine how it would be? She will regret thinking of it all her life. Dude you live or die! Here on you're Rudra. The thing is, you're aware of the entire truth. But I regret that I won't be able to kill you. But I have other plans for you. -Hello! -This is Martin speaking. Ah...tell me Sir. Rudra... ...I mean Arjun. I caught him. Oh, that's very good Sir. Where are you? Just listen to what I have to say. Don't get your team. Come alone. Second floor mortuary. I'm coming. Game Over! Sir, Martin Sir. What happened? Where's he? He's inside. What are you going to do? The evidence is strong. Will arrest and produce him in front of the court. And then... Do you think Anjali will let it slide? What else do you expect me to do? Just like how Anjali finished Rudra's case, you finish it in the same pattern. The evidence is strong... ...there's shooting order against Rudra. This is a sensational case. Tomorrow the entire media, will be raving about you. Promotion, Fame, and what not. Narayan, how long have you decided to be Anjali's assistant? Be careful Sir, there are broken bottles on the floor. What happened Anjali? Anbuarasan is not picking up the call. I think something is wrong. I have to go. What happened? Constables get the maintenance guys. Inform the security. Mom, you stay right here. Arjun! I think you're ready to shoot me at once. What's wrong with you? Ma'am. Did anyone come here? No, why do you ask? There's a small issue downstairs. Someone has cut down the main cable of this building's elevator. By the time I went to check that out... ...I felt that someone came inside. That's why inquired. No one came inside. Fine, I'll wait outside. Arjun you've been hurt really bad. What happened to you? What's it Anjali? If you had shot me in front of the Police, you could've got another promotion for putting down Rudra. You missed it the last time. Shoot me now. Shoot me right here. Hey, if I knew it was you, I wouldn't have shot. Not Arjun, It's Rudra... ...isn't it!? You created Rudra... ...and he played with that name. In the end you turned me into Rudra. Why don't you shoot me Anjali? Shoot me Anjali! What is he saying Anjali? Arjun, you're not aware of the fact. Do you really think so? Just for the heck of a posting, a promotion, you did everything for that. I never thought you will be, stooping to such low level, without any humanity. Arjun don't speak without knowing the facts. I've heard stories of people doing a lot to become successful, but now I got a reality check. You killed 4 innocent guys in the process. -Why don't you do the same to me... -Who is innocent? Who's innocent? What do you even know? Say, I killed them... ...I agree to it. But don't call them innocent. I'm not like this. You've seen me in a different character. Also, you knew what Anjali lost in her life. Hey, hey...hey guys. I have an interview please listen to me. Hey...guys move away. Guys give way, come on give way. Hey put me down guys. Hey, stop it guys. What function is this? Why are there instruments here? Oh is he the groom? Who are you calling a groom? That's right it's him, Mr. Vikramadithyan, my brother-in-law. Good, good! What's wrong with you guys? You've abducted a man and are getting him married. I'm jobless, and not worthy of it. I'll take care of it. Aren't you ashamed getting a jobless guy married to your sister? No worries. Sounds like he is not in favour of this marriage. Just 'cause the bride to be is a CBI officer, you can't force him into this. Sir, you tell me. Are you interested in this marriage or not? Sir, it's totally a different issue. Brother...brother. Sir, Sir...he'll try to convince you, don't trust him. Sir, it's matter of a man's life. Sir save me, sir... I don't want this. Sir listen to me, please save me from them. Sir please save me, please. Sir please save me....Sir! I've stopped, take your hands off. Step aside. What kind of family are you guys? Hey stop right there, where are you going? Father, even you're supporting this? Isn't this wrong, Father? I raised you... ...life is not just about earning a lot. Living with the right woman is called life. You're being blessed with a better life than what I had in mind. If I don't support this, then who else will? Don't be annoying, Father... ...is this why we waited so long? Oh so I'm annoying now? Hey, I'm going to be the first witness to your marriage. Didn't you love her? Just shut up and stand here. Even Jesus can't forgive you on this. God bless you Father. Vikram! Baby! I'm pretty sure they will agree to this at my place, I waited 'cause you asked me to. Here, hold this. I can't anymore, Vikram. Baby... ...I know how hurting it is to live without no one. You've lived a happy life with parents and your brother. You'll get married in haste and then will miss them later. You're right, I'll miss them... ...I would want to meet them. I might cry too. You should be consoling me. Romance with me. What better job do you have other than that? What's this Baby? Ok fine. If my parents never come to your terms, will you let go off me? I'll die! Sorry... ...fine, sorry. I'm sorry! I'm really sorry. Are you Ok Baby!? You and I dear, lost into each other's eyes. Let's live our life at the horizon together. For this lifetime, it's enough if you're with me. We can close our eyes and sleep in peace. You and I dear, lost into each other's eyes. Let's live our life at the horizon together. You're my path and the foot to it. You're my destiny 'O' dear. You're my sky and the earth to it. You're my everything 'O' dear. You're my path and the foot to it. You're my destiny 'O' dear. You're my sky and the earth to it. You're my everything 'O' dear. He was fine... ...but he went silent after few drinks. What happened? -Nothing, a junior at my college. -Ah...!? I got stuck ragging a junior at the college, her brother is quite a well built man... ...he got me married to her. What can I do? I'm sad. Oh then it's not a matter of love? Ey...! Just look at my wife once. Hey! She's my wife. She's like a sister to you. Understood? -Sister is it!? -Yes. Sister is awesome. Hi baby, how are you? Dance!? And me!? -That's right, come on. -Hey...hey! You're my life just like my mother tongue I'll descend into the sand, if your shadow is lost. Your eyes gleam with love I found myself in you. When I return very late... ...will sleep on your lap like a baby. You and I dear, lost into each other's eyes Let's live our life at the horizon together. Fulfilling your desires... ...I'll turn into a fish on hot water. I'll borrow your love, and will bear it myself. I'm living taking yours and my destiny to be the same. I literally die if you shed a tear Flowers on the roads bends down to have a look at us Don't worry about the future, just live every moment You and I dear, lost into each other's eyes Let's live our life at the horizon together. You're my path and the foot to it. You're my destiny 'O' dear. You're my sky and the earth to it. You're my everything 'O' dear You're my path and the foot to it. You're my destiny 'O' dear. You're my sky and the earth to it. You're my everything 'O' dear So you're ready, that's great. Let's go. -Let's go!? -Ya. Why are you coming? That's right, brother-in-law had invited me. Isn't this a send off party? If he invites, how can you just agree? Don't you have any sense? Bloody fool. Aren't you an adult enough? I'm already upset thinking I'm going to miss my husband. I'm ready... ...take this, are you guys ready? Shall we leave? -Shall we leave? -No, it's nothing but... He wants to Skype chat with his girlfriend. So he won't be coming with us. Shall we leave? -Is it so? -Ya! Why don't you ask him yourself? Is it so Arjun? That's right, my girlfriend is in Nigeria... ...she'll be on Skype now. I thought of chatting with her. Anjali said she'll miss you a lot, she's pretending to be cool about it. She wants to spend some alone time with you. She asked me to shut up and stay at home. Fine, then you shut up and stay back. -Ok, Ok...! -Ok, Arjun. -Take care. -Ok... Great husband and wife, a sweet family. -Bye Arjun! -We're leaving. Let's leave. I thought you'll go to Dubai or Qatar... ...but you're headed to USA. Unknown language, you'll be twisting it to the core. You'll have fun taking selfies with hot American chicks. You're gonna have fun. Why do you have to work abroad? Why can't you just stay beside me? I'll take very good care of my sweetheart. Thanks! Is your self-respect pricking you? There's no self-respect when it comes to my love. You've been taking care of me since we started dating. I don't mind being beside you and spend the rest of my life... ...but won't I have some wish to do something for my lovelies. May be for 3 or 4 years... ...will make as much as possible. Will shower you guys with what I had wished for. I'll make lunch for my love... ...and change diapers of my cute little one. I'll be happy and stay the same until the end, watching soap opera everyday with great pride. But to be honest... ...I kept expecting the Visa to get delayed. Hoping to stay until the delivery. I prayed to every God that I should get a chance to see you both together. But God had different plans for me... ...the Visa arrived early. So what, you leave... ...once our son is born, I'll come there with him. Son!? We'll have a daughter. Strong and bold, just like my dear Anjali. I want to take her around the world. I want her to live her life. I'll teach her what's good and what's bad. Hey baby...what happened? Baby what happened? What happened? Here have some water. Drink water. Ok...Ok! Oh no! Just like you wished... ...our daughter is finally here. You can teach her yourself. Speak to her. Baby! Baby...! It's me Dad speaking... How are you? Dear, you shouldn't be like your Dad. You should be brave like your Mom. Shouldn't be scared of anything. You should walk with your chin up. You should always speak looking into the eyes. Shouldn't cry, no matter how tough it gets. I've never seen your Mother cry. You should be the same. You should never be upset 'cause Dad isn't with you. No matter how far I am... ...I'll always be thinking of you. Even if I get a short break, I'll come running right away. What's it Vikram? You're smothering her, and she's kicking back. If the love on me fades away after she's born, I'll kill you. No way the love can fade off, you're my first love. First you get that into your head. I want to scream into every ear in this world. Hey, look here... ...there's no chance in the world you can get a wife like me. Fine, then give a shout out now. But there's no one to hear it. The world has its ears, you just shout. Do you think so? Hey...! Give me a kiss first. Oh no! I did warn earlier... ...let's not go on a drive, we won't have control. We're done for life. Oh no! That's it, we're doomed. If they do a check-up, they'll know we all are under drug abuse. Don't panic. Bloody, how can I not? Vikram! We all are going to die inside the jail you a*****e. Vikram...! Hey! Vikram! Vikram... Please... ...please help us. My husband is bleeding profusely, there's a hospital nearby... ...please take us there. Please...! Hey, what's this? Please! Please help us. Please... ...he won't survive. She has seen us. Hey buddy, we're going to be in trouble. Moreover, she's a Govt. Officer, let's just go. Please...please, don't. No matter what happens, I won't create any issue. Just take my husband to the hospital. I beg of you people, please! We can't just leave them here. Please... Please. Hey! Don't... ...please don't. Sorry! VIKRAM! VIK...RAM...! Those eyes... ...and that split second which looked at me without batting. It said that "Everything is over, Anjali". I was lying there without an answer. Anjali, you've been blessed with a girl child. Sorry Anjali... ...excess blood loss. We couldn't save your husband. It was an head injury. Police have checked all the CCTV cameras. According to them, no vehicle had passed though at that hour. If we give them any information, we can find out who it was. Do you remember anything? Car number, who it was or anything you can remember? Hey Shalu dear, haven't you slept yet? I thought you went to sleep. You have to go to school tomorrow, let's get to bed. It's nothing dear. It's nothing. Huh, shall we go to sleep? Come. All of it... ...happened right in front of that traffic camera, but nothing was captured by the camera. If there was no car which had passed by... ...do you think the wind threw us away? I knew the nature of those guys. I also knew people like us, can't do anything about it. That doesn't... ...mean we can just sit ducks without doing anything. I lost my Vikram. Now you decide. I should live, just for my daughter. I shouldn't get caught. I created a character called Rudra, that character just kills for the money. Don't... I didn't do anything wrong. I was the one driving... ...but it was him who killed your husband. Ma'am I did tell him to leave from there. Please let go off me, Ma'am. When two lives are struggling, you left them to die. Isn't it wrong? It's not only here, there are many accidents and murders happening on daily basis. Just the way how responsible the murderer and the accused. Instead of saving those lives, they gather around and gaze at them struggling. Even they are responsible for their deaths. Don't. Help! Is your vision getting blurry? Are you feeling dizzy? You can feel your life is slipping away bit by bit, don't you? Even he would've felt the same. Anjali, I was very close in killing your brother, but I caught hold of a sniffer dog. Him and all the information he sniffed out... ...I've kept it all at one place. Anbuarasan!? Ah....! He was feeling cold. Let him be warm. Martin let him go. Anbuarasan! Anbuarasan! Hello! Martin let him go. Anbuarasan! Anbuarasan! Ya Anbuarasan is safe and sound burning here. So hereafter no matter how much you try, you can't harm me Anjali. No more evidences. If I'm done killing Krithika... Martin Sir, please listen to me. I was not responsible for any of your sufferings. Your anger isn't rightful. In spite of that if you wanted to avenge, you should've come after me. You've been killing people with no relevance. Hey...Hey, wait...wait! I very well know, what you're going to say next. Please don't harm Krithika. Am I right!? I had great respect on you. This begging... ...and pleading, please don't damage your reputation. Martin, I'm not begging. I'm advising you. I wasn't aware all this while, who it was. That was the only issue. But now I know. It's going to be easy for me. Ahaan! You did mention Game Over... ...it isn't over yet. I'm telling this now... ...just one more day and we'll finish this game. Oh is it the brother? Good luck brother! This evening around 6 pm, it is said that entire 8th floor has been evacuated following a fire. My daughter is not safe here... ...we have court orders. And we're shifting my daughter to a different facility. For better treatment and security. But she happens to be a crucial witness. Where are you planning to shift her? We're shifting her to a high-end medical facility. Ok! The details of time and place will be confidential. Thank you guys, sorry. Sir, please come this side. Hmmm...keep an eye. Hello, Martin Sir. Did you see the news? What are you going to do? They have court orders. So we're going to shift her. In a way, her safety is very important for this case. Krithika is safe only until she's at the hospital. If they're moving her from there, Martin will definitely plan something. No Sir, Rudra can't do anything. The details of shifting are kept very confidential. Morning 9:00 am with full security, we're going to transfer her to the airport. Via Elahanka airport sub-road. From there on a full equipped aircraft, we'll transfer her to London. Good...sounds like a plan. Now matter what he plans... ...he should be doing what we want him to. What's it Arjun? Martin Sir... ...please watch the news. This is Rudra speaking, I'm going to kidnap my next target at 11 am. You can't catch me, neither you can destroy me. If you can, try stopping me. Good Luck! Hello are you there? Just like that, I distracted the CBI. I'm right here at the hospital. In sometime, I'll take away Krithika from here. Once she regains consciousness the world will come to know, who Rudra is. You must've planned a lot. Until I'm alive, you can't even come wee closer to her. Narayan! Narayan, Rudra kidnapped Krithika from the hospital. He's on the airport road, I'm following that ambulance. If you come sooner, we can rescue her. Please track the network on my phone. Go to the airport road. Arjun! Brother Arjun. Where are you? Let's not play too much of hide and seek, and if you come out yourself, without inflicting any pain, I'll just shoot one bullet into your head, and I'll be on my way out. Damn it... ...no one from your family attacks face-to-face? Fine! First let me kill Krithika... ...then will kill Ju. Oh no! Wondering if he's still alive!? Are you watching? Brother! Can you see me? Ah! Rudra, drop your weapon. I said drop it. Drop it! Narayan. Go and check if Krithika is fine. Krithika is not inside the ambulance Mr. Martin Sir. As per CBI's plan, they would've shifted her. Rudra, I have all evidences against you. I said drop your weapon. He is under the impression that the game is over. We should get him inside this game once again, and frame him as Rudra. How? In his style how he speaks, we have to speak to the media, and we should do that from his location. This is Rudra speaking. I'm going to kidnap my next target at 11 am. If you can, try stopping me. Let's go! Sir! Check if this matches with the serial numbers from the ransom money. -Yes Sir! -I'm opening it, Sir. You're right Sir, it matches with the currency. Call up the Police stationed at Anjali's house. Hey, don't you have any sense? Don't you understand? Food is what you eat, right? Hey, wait for a moment. Why are you getting tensed? Huh!? -Where's your mother? -She's inside the bathroom. Bathroom...!? Oh...you're here to check? Go on, check come check. Whatever you did here... ...how you misbehaved with the ladies, I'll record everything and post it on YouTube. If I shoot from here, your face will be visible. -Come on! Go and check. -What do I say now!? Yes Sir! I've checked Sir. Ma'am is right here. I imported everything illegally for him, I wasn't aware of anything. As he's a Police officer, I didn't think twice before giving it to him. Sir, one unexpected news, former ACP Martin Roy is Rudra. What!? I've got solid evidence against him. He planned it well and escaped framing Arjun as Rudra. I'll arrange for a warrant right away. Find out where he is and arrest him immediately. Ok Sir! Call Rachel immediately, -ask him to track his phone. -Yes Sir. -I want his location. -Yes Sir. Narayan, Rudra kidnapped Krithika from the hospital. He's on the airport road. Track the network on my phone, I'm coming. I'll be there right away. Go to the airport road. GAME...OVER! I wasn't aware all this while, who it was. That was the only issue. But now I know. It's going to be easy for me. Good... Good Finish! Rudra! If at all you knew why I wore the mask of Rudra, may be, you wouldn't have even touched it. Rest in peace, Martin Sir! Isn't it true? Every good thing which happens in this world... ...bad things too.... ...even behind every syllable, there's love. One minute Arjun. How are you Ju? Are you going to stay silent? We're far apart... ...but it feels like you're right next to me. Do you feel the same? Will you be good to me, if I give you another chance? Baby! It's me Dad speaking... How are you? Dear, you shouldn't be like your Dad. You should be brave like your Mom. Shouldn't cry, no matter how tough it gets. I've never seen your Mother cry. You should be just like her. You should never be upset 'cause Dad isn't with you. No matter how far I am... ...I'll always be thinking of you. Even if I get a short break, I'll come running right away.
