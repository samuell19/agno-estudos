I think not even close This time you really are something How could it be like that? What happened? For thirty years, no drug has ever come into Lung Sheng You mean no one has ever got caught? Ma definitely would not do the drugs business Now there are only two possibilities : If these drugs are not smuggled in under Ma's approval then that means Ma cannot control his people anymore But if these are arranged by Ma then we have to eliminate them all Do you have any evidence for putting charges on him? We still haven't got enough evidence We should wait until the right time to arrest them Then we just wait here I think it wouldn't take long Nice to meet you No drug has ever come into Lung Sheng? How about the other smugglings? Sheriff Lin is too familiar to their background Yes, really familiar Then why doesn't he arrest them? I can't get used to this shit, baby I've got it, Tony The Chinese are real shrewd and devious people but you are the best, baby You made me one of the best No one can touch me... Unless I want to be touched Chong's record, listing everyone on Ma's payroll How did you get this? Chong's room, after he was killed No body saw you? If they did, would I be here now?
