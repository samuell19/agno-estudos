He was the hottest thing on television. Everybody was just in awe of this guy. I got captivated watching Raymond Mancini and hearin' his story about his dad and watchin' his fights. His fights were action-packed. Ray was always great for ratings. People just ate it up and he became an icon on the American sports scene. Ray 'Boom Boom' Mancini was not just a fighter. He was an attraction. He was a star. When he fought, people watched. Big time. At that time, you know, the unemployment rate was sky-high. Nothing was going right in Youngstown. People gravitated towards Ray. Ray was Youngstown. When we're 12 years old, we give our dad a tie or we give him a card or something. Raymond gave his dad a promise that "I will win the title that you so well deserve." 'Boom Boom' Mancini is the most marketable fighter in the world and if they play it right, he could become the most marketable athlete in the world. All he's got to do is go past this kid Duk-koo Kim. This father-and-son thing that has run through the Mancini family for years and for him to tragically have taken the life of a father and now to meet that son... that's got to be a real challenge for Ray. So this is where it all began. This is the home, 807 Cambridge Avenue, south side of Youngstown, Ohio, the only house I've ever known. My parents lived in here, this house, 54 years. It was Middle America. You know, playing baseball, football, in the streets, and there's so many kids. I mean, the Secoras lived across the street. Tank Dicioccio, my buddy, grew up in this house here with his brother Jumbo and Bobby and Lori and his... and his sister Beany, five of them. It was a wonderful life, man, and I'll never forget it. You know, it was great. I love this place, I truly do. I love these people, love this town. Yeah, my heart's still here, that's for sure. Ain't never left. I grew up 810 Cambridge Avenue. Ray grew up 807, which is right across the street. He was the first friend I had, first person that I met. Neighbours had their doors open. You can hear kids getting lickings. The Mancinis can hear the Dicioccios getting lickings. We can hear them getting lickings. You get home from school and get your homework done, you're out in the streets and you're playin'. We couldn't wait for 'Boom Boom', 'cause that's what we called Ray's dad. We didn't know why, 'cause we were young then. We didn't know he was a fighter. We used to go down in the basement all the time, and pull out the scrapbook of 'Boom Boom', his father. This one fight in particular that Ray said he got robbed, Ray wanted really to avenge that. I mean, he actually wanted to be his father. And he understood this at a young age of five, six. He understood that. Guys used to kid him when we were playin' baseball, football... "What are goin' to be when you grow up?" "You know, I'm goin' to be a boxer." Guys used to say, "Well, what are you gonna box? "You gonna box oranges? You gonna box apples? What are you gonna box?" He goes "You'll see. I'm gonna be a champion. "I'm gonna be a champion for my father." RADIO: BOXING MATCH September 1913, Nick Mancino passes through Ellis Island on his way from Bagheria, Sicily to Youngstown, Ohio. 1917 he marries a local girl, Annie Kanazaro. She's remembered as something of a flapper and Nick, he was a... kind of half a wise guy. He does a bit for the Cleveland mob and when he comes back, Annie has taken up with a guy named 'Slick' Valentine Bavone. So he tells his son, Lenny, he says, "Listen, I got to go away now." When my grandfather left to go, he wanted to go with his father. But my grandfather told him "No, you gotta stay and take care of your mother." He cried so much that night. My father was ten years old. My father said "I could never cry again." When the Depression came, he comes under the influence of his Uncle Ferpo, who would take Lenny out in the street, almost like his matchmaker, like his manager. Fathers and uncles and older brothers would meet on the street corner and they'd say "Hey, my kid can kick your kid's ass." "Oh yeah? No, my kid can kick your kid's ass." "How much you want to bet?" So they put their money down and to entice the odds and to entice the drama of it, Uncle Ferpo would say "Look at this kid." Bang! Rake the hand right across Lenny's mouth. "Look, he don't even cry!" My father was a man that, truly, when I say had no fear, no fear. He's legendary in Youngstown for being on the streets. He ain't never lost a street fight. They used to tell stories how he used to turn joints out, you know. He'd walk up and they'd say "Boom, please, whatever you do, don't wreck the joint tonight." That was just his thing. He had no fear in him, and he was a stand-up guy. What happens with Lenny is, he realises there's no way for him to really be the kind of fighter he wants to be if he's going to stay in Youngstown. He knows the capital of the fight game is New York City. He meets the great trainer Ray Arcel passing through town. He says "I'm comin' to New York." He goes "Sure, kid. "You come to New York, you look me up at Stillman's Gym." Couple of weeks later, Lenny Mancino is in New York City, hustles a bus ticket, shows up at Stillman's, taps Ray Arcel on the shoulder. "Hey, here I am." He fights a guy named Charlie Varre in the Broadway Arena in Brooklyn. Varre breaks his jaw. He wins the fight, but with a broken jaw. Tells Arcel and the rest of the guys in Stillman's, "Listen, I'm going home." They say "Hey, take care, kid. It was nice." They don't think he's gonna show up. Six months later, "Hey, I'm back." He's serious. This is really all he ever wanted to do, was be a fighter. My father had a scrapbook. It was like my Holy Grail. It was all tattered pages and every once in a while, I'd say, "Dad, can I see the scrapbook yet?" "Aw, Raymond." I'd hound him all the time. I used to love lookin' at those pictures. They had one picture of him after a Billy Marquette fight. One eye swollen, the other was completely closed, both lips swollen and bloodied and he's got a cut in the other eye, and he won. That picture, man, to me, it's the most beautiful picture I ever have of him. He's beautiful. That picture, it's everything I wanted to be. People are paying money. They want to see, essentially, violence. They want to know that they're getting their money's worth. And when you saw Lenny Mancini, as he was now called, 'cause they figured "Mancini" was a better name, you knew you were getting your money's worth. 'Boom Boom' Mancini meant something. He kept coming forward. That becomes an immense source of pride for Lenny 'Boom Boom' Mancini. "I never took a step back." December 7, 1941, world war broke out. Lenny Mancini gets drafted. To the draft board he says, "I'll give you all my money. "You know, I have to, I'd like to fight for the title." But they said no. He went in a number one contender, lightweight contender. November 10, 1944, a German mortar shell explodes perilously close to 'Boom Boom'. He takes it in the left collarbone, left shoulder, left arm, left leg, right foot. Curiously, what he tells people later is that, "I was hurt bad, but I was not knocked out." He went in 5 foot 2, 135 pounds. He came back 5 foot 2, 175 pounds, filled with shrapnel and everything else. Well, how do you think he did against these 175-pound, 6'2", 6'3"? They used him as a punching-bag. So, you know, his career when he came back wasn't too long, but maybe it was too long. I had wrote a poem for my father, Father's Day of 1976. I was 15 years old and I wanted to let him know what I thought of him as a man, as a person, my hero. And uh, that he was everything I wanted to be. And um, it was called "I Walk in Your Shadow." And it goes, "I watch every step that this man takes. "Listen to every sound that this man makes. "I touch every part of this man's face. "I hold this man's body when we embrace. "I cry every tear that this man cries. "I try every task that this man tries. "I keep every memory that this man keeps. "I leap every mountain that this man leaps. "I love you, Dad. I really want you to know I want to be like you "and walk in your shadow. "I want to be like you and live with your great name, "for I am this man's son, and I'll never bear him shame." Yeah, I was 15 when I wrote that. LAUGHS Wow. Uh, when I gave it to him, he read it and tears welled up in his eyes, and tears started coming down. Now, you have to understand, my father never cried. I never saw my father cry before that. He read it, closed it and he went in his room and he just stayed in there for a while. I worked in the mills. I can remember getting a sandwich. You'd go to the commissary and get a sandwich. It was always white bread. There was no such thing as whole-wheat. You'd get a white-bread, say, egg salad, for example, and you'd come out and you'd have to eat it really fast, 'cause if you didn't eat it really fast, the white bread would turn grey in the air. It was what they called graphite. So you'd just, you know hey, you're breathing it. What the fuck difference would it make, really? It was in my brain that I was gonna work in the mill because my father and my grandfather retired. They worked 40 years in the mills, you know. And so I just... once you got by, you accepted it, that that's what you do and, you know, you do it. Youngstown has always had a lot of labels, Murder Town USA, Bomb Town USA. To understand it, you have to look at the geography. Youngstown is between Pittsburgh and Cleveland, both of which have a mob presence and they're rival mobs. So Youngstown being in the middle, there's always been a lot of fighting over Youngstown and the rackets in Youngstown. And so over the years from the 40s, the 50s, the 60s, we had a number of pretty high- profile mob killings, bombings, shootings, things of that nature. By 1963, Youngstown is on the cover of the Saturday Evening Post as Crimetown USA. It's become nationally known for car bombings, otherwise known as a "Youngstown tune-up", which means that you go into your car in the morning, you turn on the ignition, it blows sky-high. You never know who was doing what, so it was better just to, you know, mind your own business. And if you worked in the steel mill, you put in your eight hours, every now and then you'd double out, you'd go cash your cheque at that trailer with the little window. You'd go buy yourself a couple of drinks. That was the life. And it was a good one, you could put kids through school. As long as you didn't try to move up. If you tried to get up there and start swimming around with those sharks, you'd better be a shark. There was a lot of tension between my mum and dad every day. I think that has, you know, my dad liked to drink. He was a very well-known person in town. Everybody knew who 'Boom Boom' Mancini was. On our side of town, literally, the main drag that was three blocks up, within three blocks, there had to be twelve bars, because that's what you did. When I was eight, nine, ten years old, my father, he'd get home between 4 and 4.30 from work. If he didn't come home by 4.30, I'd get a little nervous. So I'd call the, wondering, "Is 'Boom Boom' Mancini there?" "Is Boom Boom here?" "Tell 'em Boom ain't here." But he'd be there. "Tell 'em Boom ain't here." "No, Boom Boom's not there." "Okay." I'd hang up the phone, I'd ride up the two blocks. I'd go up there and I'd look through the window like this. And I'd see him sittin' at the bar. I'd come inside. I'd look. I'd look down the bar, see if I could see him. A lot of times I immediately saw him or I could hear him. You know, and I'd come over to him. He'd be sittin' there. A lot of times, I'd hear people say, "Hey, Boom, you gonna have a drink?" And I was a little kid. I'd say, "Boom ain't havin' no drink." The bartender would look at him and go, "You're gonna listen to him?" He'd say, "Eh, what do you want me to do? He's my baby." So I'd grab him by the hand. I'd literally I'd hold him by the hand 'cause, you know, it depends how many drinks he had, and uh, I'd hold his hand and walk out the door. RONALD REAGAN: "Good evening. Tonight, Thomas Mitchell "and Vincent Price star on the General Electric Theatre." My sister and me are 13? years apart. She was born November 14, 1948. When she was 18, she moved out. I was five years old at the time, so I don't remember her in this house growing up so much as me and my brother. Lenny was 5? years older than me. His birthday is September 21, 1955. Now, growing up, my parents couldn't leave us alone 'cause he liked to slap me around a little bit. I used to be scared to death of him. So, and then when my parents would come home, I'd hide behind my mother and my father and agitate him. Lenny and Raymond, when someone says "They'll kill each other", I truly, truly believed one of 'em would have been very seriously hurt if they were ever left alone together, and it would go to blows. It would go to physical blows. How I can sum it up about Lenny, like when we used to play Release, we had boundaries, maybe two blocks of boundaries. You couldn't leave those boundaries, and when people were caught and the game was over and we... we would have to call a new game, we would say, "Alli, alli, in free." You know, "Everybody in." Well, Lenny never came in. Even though Ray and his brother Lenny are kind of opposites, Ray follows Lenny wherever he goes. He loves his older brother. And of course, where does Lenny go? Into the ring. He trains at a Navy Reserve gym under a trainer of some renown in Youngstown called Eddie Sullivan. And Lenny's a really good boxer. Lenny's not just a puncher, but he can move. Ray follows his big brother into the gym When he's a kid, 13 years old, he tells Eddie Sullivan "I'm going to be the best fighter you ever have." "Hey, thanks kid. See you later." Sure enough, he comes back about 16 years old. Ray had been an excellent local athlete. There was a point at which, freshman year at Cardinal Mooning, his coaches say, "Listen, you can't play running back at 130, 135 pounds. "We need you to gain weight. You're good, you have talent. "We can get you a full boat ride to college." And he says "Gain weight? I've got to make weight! "I've got to fight at 126, 130 pounds." "Well, kid, what's the matter with you? "What do you want to be a fighter for?" "My dad." Neither one of my parents wanted me to fight, per se, but my father used to set me down and tell me how painful it was, not only physically, but mentally and emotionally, that you have to sacrifice your family life, your social life, to focus on fighting. But my mother supported me. She never wanted me to be a fighter, obviously, but she always supported me and no matter what I wanted, she believed in me. Ray wasn't a normal kid and he wouldn't be a normal fighter. He wasn't really fuelled by economic circumstance. His whole construct was desire. It was his kind of personal religion. TV: "They stopped taking orders at midnight "at Youngstown Steel Sheet and Tube Company "and by the end of the year, 5,000 workers will be jobless." September 19, 1977, which is known around here as Black Monday, it decimated this whole town and I don't think we've ever recovered. After the mills closed, those jobs weren't available any more and young men that would ordinarily have gone to the mills had to look for other opportunities to make money and I think, you know, a lot of them turned to crime. Youngstown did get meaner after the mills closed because, uh, you had to compete. A fallout of Black Monday is that Lenny eventually loses his mill job. What does he do? He goes back to the gym, he starts fighting again. He tells Ray "I have unfinished business." Him and Ray start sparring and really initiates Ray into a new level of physical endurance. It takes him to a place he really didn't know he could go. Ray and Lenny would have some wars in there. I think Ray appreciated Lenny more because now Lenny was in his world now, where Lenny was never really in Ray's world, ever. You know, he was in his own world. I would say out of all the kids in the neighbourhood, we were in one world, Ray was in another world. We got very close. Lenny was able to find himself again, regain himself, by coming to the gym. Everyone around in the gym will tell you, he was a better fighter than me. He hit harder, a better boxer. The one thing he lacked that I did have is discipline. Well, I remember the first time I went to the Struthers Fieldhouse, my father took me. And the Golden Gloves was tremendous. It was sold out every night. It was pretty much black and white. You'd root for the white guy and there were some real good black fighters, always, and there were some pretty good white fighters. And the Mancinis, they were tough guys. We used to love to see those kids come in because it was pure carnage. You know, the bell would ring and they were like pitbulls, you know, right out after guys. Always got your money's worth with the Mancini brothers. Youngstown Golden Gloves was very popular. It was the only thing in town for fighters. And this place here was jammed to the rafters with people. You couldn't get a seat. People who had the ringside seats were like people from Youngstown, the politicians and stuff, people who had money, don't want to flash, so they sit in ringside. I'll tell you this, I wouldn't want to be any fighter that was comin' in to fight me here. You know, to be an opponent in this place wasn't good. Ray thought "Well, maybe I don't have all the natural gifts "that some of these guys I'm going to have to fight are going to have", you know, length, tall, speed, something, you know. But he thought "If I outwork them, I'll take more, I'll do more." He just never, would never back up. If Ray backed up, he was going to lose the fight. You'll hear a bunch of guys in Youngstown talk about seeing Lenny fight in the amateurs at Struthers Fieldhouse and all the things he could do in the ring. What he lacks is Ray's desire, and desire is a talent too. When it comes to that, no one is more talented than Ray. So eventually, Lenny drops out. Ray keeps going. Lenny becomes basically a collections guy for bookmakers, for loan sharks. Ray keeps on as a fighter. Ray wins amateur titles. Ray thinks he's going to the Olympics, but really, the type of style he has, you can see from the beginning, is suited to the pros. He loses to a guy named Melvin Paul in the amateurs and like some of the guys that Ray lost to as an amateur, it was a question of style. After the fight with Melvin Paul, I was sitting in the dressing room, dejected. Murphy Griffith came walking in. He just told me, like, "Look, man, "you ain't gonna never win no amateur titles "'cause you got a pro style, but you could be a very, very good pro." And he said "I work with a manager named Dave Wolf. "So, you know, I'll put Dave in touch with you in a couple of days." And what Griffith tells Wolf is, "I found a kid who is like a little Rocky Graziano." Now what that means is, number one, he'll fight. He won't be cute. Dave said "Look, I'm not offering you anything up front. "I'm not going to pay you a weekly salary." He says "You're going to have to move to New York, "pay your own rent "'cause I don't want you to have to owe me anything "and I don't want to owe you anything." He said "But the bottom line is, you do your job, "and I'll do mine and I'll get you to a world championship." Meanwhile back in Youngstown, there is a consortium of local guys, some of whom are Youngstown wise guys, who want Ray. Ray and his father discuss it, and Griffith keeps calling Ray. Boom says to Ray, "You know, all the years I was a fighter, "I never had my trainer call me." My father said "If you stay here, you're going to starve." He said, "Raymond, I starved. That's why I had to leave. "You stay here, you're gonna starve. You've got to go." Dave Wolf understands what he has. The networks, ABC, NBC, CBS are still fully into the boxing business. Saturday and Sunday afternoons, there are network fights. And the networks become specialty houses for certain weight divisions. Ray is going to be a lightweight. That means CBS. As we come into the 80s in America's great postwar industrial recession, the beginning of Reagan, after America has seen "Rocky", Ray Mancini is demographically perfect. So Dave Wolf starts putting out these great press kits. Hey, the father was named 'Boom Boom' Mancini. He takes pictures of Ray. He takes pictures of Ray and his father. He puts out the old press kit photos of the original 'Boom Boom'. Now you have a new 'Boom Boom'. Listen, you've got a Jewish manager, a black trainer and an Italian stallion from Youngstown, Ohio. It's perfect. Who could write this stuff? Stallone couldn't write this. Not only that, there's a new cable station, ESPN, which features a once-a-week show, "Top Rank Boxing", which is run by the promoter Bob Arum. When I first started in boxing in the mid-sixties, the only thing that mattered was the heavyweight division. It was Muhammad Ali, Joe Frazier, Ken Norton, and that really didn't change in America until 1976 when the Olympiad was held in Montreal and the United States had this boxing team headed by Sugar Ray Leonard. 1976 Olympics was really the door opening for the lighter weights and we brought home five gold medals. That was such a major accomplishment. And then the networks grabbed on to us and all of a sudden now the smaller weights, because they were more entertaining, there was more punches, there was more excitement, that we took over. Ray draws some notice from Arum. Arum asks his matchmaker, Teddy Brenner, one of the great matchmakers of all time, "What do you think about this kid Mancini?" "I saw his father fight." Those are magic words. So they decide "Let's put Ray on one of our top-ranked shows, "an ESPN card, put him on television, see how he does." ANNOUNCER: Ray 'Boom Boom' Mancini! At that time, Ray was knocking most of the fighters out in the first or second round, you know. Ray's brother Lenny would be in that corner any way he could get there. He was always one of the first, if not the first person in the ring, from wherever he was sitting. He'd be the first one there to hold Ray's hand up. APPLAUSE It was Valentine's Day 1981 and we were out as we usually were. When I came home that night, it was quite late. All the lights were on in my house and all the lights were on in Ray's house. I thought I was in trouble for doing something and I walked in and my brother, at the time he was supervisor at the Southside Hospital and he said, "Tank," he goes, "I got something to tell you." I says, "Well, what's the matter? You know, am I in trouble? "What happened? Somebody get hurt? Mum, Dad, you know?" He says "No, Lenny got shot." We didn't know his condition. We knew it was serious and I remember going into the emergency room and the nurse was telling us "He's gone" but you hear the words and it doesn't register, "He's gone." I mean, it's just like, I... it took me, I bet you almost five minutes to realise she's telling me he's passed away. And I remember my first reaction was, "How could you do this to us?" I got that call on Saturday from my sister. When I answered the phone, she said, "Raymond, I got bad news." "What?" She said "It's Lenny." I said "Is he okay? What happened?" She goes "He got shot." She said "Raymond, he's dead." And, um... when I heard that, I, um... I don't know, man, I... all I remember is I broke... I just fell to the floor. I don't, um, I don't remember everything that was said. I don't remember everything that was done. All I do remember is, though, is my roommate, Randy Stevens, was a great fighter in his own right, who I'll love forever, he was there and he just came over and grabbed me. Everything was moving in slow motion. I don't know if it was because I couldn't comprehend everything. I chose not to. But when I finally got to the hospital, there was cars, people there and when I saw my mother and father, I just hugged them, you know, and my mother broke down, my father broke down. That, you know, everyone was crying in the house and, um, all I remember saying is that, "I got to see him, I got to see him." I went to the morgue with him and it was a very eerie... eerie feeling. I don't know, it was... You could see the agony in Ray. His body was cold, touching his face. I wanted to see where the bullet went in and... but I realised, I said, "Hey, that ain't my brother, man. "That's just his, you know, mortal remains, that was him." And, um... Finally, I kissed him on the cheek and told him I loved him and, uh, walked out. The circumstances surrounding the situation are a little murky. First of all, the young lady that was involved was a juvenile at the time, but she gave a false name and a false age and it took the detectives three or four days to actually discover who she was. She was dancing at a number of bars and she had just escaped a motorcycle gang in another town that had basically been prostituting her out. She was a runaway. She had been living on her own for some time and the biker gang went to Lenny and said "You want the girl, that's great, but it's gonna cost you." Basically, Lenny says, being Lenny, "Go fuck yourself. I ain't paying you." The girl gets roughed up. Lenny tells her, "Listen, I'm not gonna let them do this to you," buys a gun, a 38 snubnose, and in the course of showing her how to use it, he gets shot. The fatal wound from the 38-calibre snubnose revolver is, according to the autopsy, an inch-and-a-half behind the right ear and an inch-and-a-half above. It's hard to have an accidental shooting back there. She admitted that she had done it, but the facts just didn't reconcile with the physical evidence and that's always been kind of a difficult situation and I know, I'm certain, was difficult for the family. Did this girl kill Lenny on behalf of the outlaws or did she let them in, or was it an accident? We'll never know for sure. After the funeral, my parents drove me to Chuck Fagan's house. so he could drive me to the airport. And, I remember saying goodbye to them and I'm hugging and kissing my mother. She's crying and I went to hug my father, kiss my father and he broke down. I just heard a strange noise, and it was a wailing. It was terrible and I looked, and I turned around and it was, Lenny lost it. It just all came out right there. I said "I ain't gotta go." And he said "No, you gotta go. "You gotta go and get on with your life. You gotta go." Finally when I left there to go to the airport, man, that was the longest drive of my life. And at that moment, Chuck, who was a wonderful guy, I mean, you can't get no better person that Chuck Fagan, can't get no better than him. That moment, he became my big brother. He became... Again, God takes, God gives. He took Lenny, but he gave me Chuck. He looked vulnerable to me for the first time. You know, he'd just lost his brother. He was going back to New York by himself. You could see that this was taking a great toll on him. Not long afterwards, he came to me in my dreams. Came to me 'cause I talked to him and we'd have a conversation and he'd let me know "I'm okay, Ray, I'm okay. I'm fine. Don't worry. "Everything's gonna be fine." And I, it gave me some kind of solace, some type of peace, but, um... I knew for me, I had to move on quickly or I'd never get on with my life. And I told my trainer, "Griff, I've got to get back in the ring." I told Dave Wolf, "Get me a fight as soon as possible." Even the death of his brother, my man was not going to be stopped. He was not going to be detoured by anything that happened in his life. This kid wanted this so bad that nothing was going to stop his progression to getting to that title, nothing. When I fought Stormin' Norman Goins, March of 1981, it was only a month removed from my brother's death. A lot of people were nervous. Didn't know how I was going to react emotionally and mentally, being so close to my brother's death, but I knew for myself, I wanted to get in there as soon as possible. Soon as the bell rang, like every other fight, I'd jump on my guy. It was a lot of action right from the get-go. He's trying to come over the top with the right hand. I'm making him miss, but eventually, he landed that one punch on the chin and everyone kind of gasped. I came right back and countered with a couple of punches and everyone knew then that I was going to be okay. A guy like Morales was a pleasure to fight. You've got to be able to back these guys up. First round, I backed him up with a series of shots and I backed him into the corner, I didn't let him off the ropes. I kept him there and I stayed there and I kept banging him and banging him with body shots and all kind of punches, lefts and rights. And I wouldn't let him out of the corner. And I let him know right from the get-go, this was my night. ANNOUNCER: ...the new North American Boxing Federation champion! The next step, to me, this was the World title. You know, there's only one higher, which is the World title, but to me, this is it and I'm gona keep this belt because the World title goes to my father. ANNOUNCER: The champion from Youngstown, Ohio! Ramirez was very crafty, very experienced, so I had to jump on him. You gotta back a southpaw up. If you don't, you're in for a long night. Always bang the body first, then come up to the chin. They're trying to jab me, I stay close, move, bang that body. Boom, and come up to the chin. It was very difficult in those days when Ray was coming up to deal with the WBA, because essentially it was a very corrupt organisation. Ray was getting ready to fight for a World title and before he could, a fighter named Arturo Frias had to fight Espana. Frias won the fight and they came up with some crazy reason to do the rematch, but the only reason they came up with that crazy reason to do the rematch is so that they could get money from me to waive the rematch, to let Mancini go in directly with Frias. But it cost $300,000 in step-aside money, but it enabled Ray to fight Frias for the title, which he was absolutely entitled to do. We decided we're going to train in Tucson. We had great sparring going on. I'm standing in there one day, Ray's shadow boxing, and I get a tap on my shoulder and it's a policeman. And he said "Are you with Mancini?" And I said, "Yeah, I'm with Mancini." He said "Well, we got a little problem." The chambermaid at the hotel said these two gentlemen that looked like they were Mexican wanted to know where Mancini was. And she said they both had guns and they were lookin' around. The policeman told me "I asked her what she thought they wanted." And she told the policeman "To kill Mancini." Now myself, thinking back on it, I think it was somebody from the WBA trying to shake Ray up and screw up the training. We moved up into the fifth or sixth floor of the main hotel and we stayed there for a while. And I kept arguing with Ray a little bit that we need to tell Wolf. And he said, "No, everything's going good. "We're gonna get Frias and win this championship. "I don't want anything screwing it up." And Ray was so focused. "All we need is Round One to happen "and Ray's gonna be the lightweight champ of the world." I came out and he threw a right hand over the top. I slipped it, but he came up and followed with a left hook and he caught me on the chin. I was able to spin right into the ropes and turn, get his back on the ropes, and then I just kept throwing punches. Punches and punches, just kept throwin' 'em. Nothing was going to stop him. He was like a whirlwind from start to finish, he just kept throwing punches. It was absolutely amazing. People got out of their seats because they was just letting go. Boom, boom, boom, boom! And Ray hurt him, he hurt Ray. It was dynamite. I could never fight that way. I threw a right hand and slipped, but I came up and hit him with a left hook on the chin. I saw him go down. I was like a shark smelling blood. When he got up, I jumped right on him. The referee, Richard Green, jumped in and stopped the fight. The greatest single moment in the history of my life. Nothing in my life will ever compare to that moment. I just want to thank God for having my... all the beautiful people of Youngstown here to cheer me on. My beautiful family here to share this with me. Thank God for all the people back in Youngstown and watching, for my grandmother watching in Youngstown, my grandfather up in the mountains, just for all the Easter Seal kids back whom I love, everything. This is theirs. Lenny, your son promised you when he was a youngster starting out that he would win this World title. Did you believe the first time he said "Dad, I'm going to win that title for you," did you believe him? Well, that was his dream. I always had to believe what he said because he dreamt that he was going to be the champion. That was all right with me. He told his dad when he won the NABF title, "This one's for me. The next one's for you, Dad." And then he had it for his dad and there was a moment where he's hugging his mum and dad and he's crying and he's kissing his dad and he's kissing his mum and, you know, just stand back and let that happen because that's been coming for 20 years. You know, that's what he's wanted to do since he was a baby and he did it. At that time, nothing was going right in Youngstown. You know, the unemployment rate was sky high. Nobody was working. People were down on their luck. People gravitated towards Ray. Ray was Youngstown. Ray was always great for ratings. People just ate it up and he became an icon on the American sports scene. Ray 'Boom Boom' Mancini was not just a fighter. He was an attraction. He was a star. When he fought, people watched. Big time. He was the hottest thing on television. Everybody was just in awe of this guy from, you know, where he came from. I got captivated watching Raymond Mancini and hearing his story about his dad, and watching his fights. His fights were action-packed. Raymond could bang with both hands. You'd hear him talking afterwards, you know, and he was a very likable guy. He was a very honest kind of guy. Reminded you of like, you know, "Oh, that guy could live down the street from me." He reminded you of somebody you knew. We all used to go to this one place on Saturday and I'd see Stallone there, and Raymond, and everybody had a certain type of respect for Raymond. Stallone had a certain type of respect or you'd see Schwarzenegger or all these other guys that knew who Raymond was. They get on the cover of "Sports Illustrated" for a lightweight. This wasn't a heavyweight. This wasn't Muhammad Ali. Everything has broken right for Ray Mancini. Dave Wolf is besieged with million-dollar offers. Everybody wants to fight Ray. The road to the money goes through Ray Mancini. Days before he fights Duk-koo Kim, the most marketable fighter in the world, arguably the most marketable athlete, Sugar Ray Leonard, announces his retirement. You know who that leaves? That leaves Ray Mancini, 'Boom Boom' Mancini, he's set up perfect. He can run the table right now. All he's got to do is go past this kid Duk-koo Kim. Duk-koo Kim is born to thankless circumstances in Korea. He's dark skinned, he's dirt poor and he's fatherless. He had no advantages. He grows up in a town called Banam on the coast not far from the border with North Korea. He's so poor, he shares an outhouse with a cow. His mother had married his latest stepfather when he met her begging on the streets. He finds his way to Seoul, takes a bunch of odd jobs. He's selling pencils on a bus, he's a waiter... Eventually, he finds his way into a gym. He's not a very good fighter, but he has no other alternatives. In a certain way, he hearkens back to fighters from Lenny Mancini's, 'Boom Boom's' generation. He's fighting because he's hungry. He has more confidence, he has more grace, and in the ring, he's begun a transformation. After he found some love, he also found a bit of courage. And then he gets more courage until finally, he's the number one contender through the graces of the WBA, a thoroughly corrupt organisation, but he's got this shot. He fought like Ray, straightforward, giving shots and taking shots. It was going to be a test of wills. A lot of the critics and writers, they didn't give Duk-koo Kim a chance. When Tank and I went to see him train a couple days before, I didn't want to tell Ray anything. I didn't want to say "This kid's a fucking animal." I didn't want to tell him that, but you could see he was in great shape, you could see that he was determined. When we were in the locker rooms before the fight, sometimes we can hear the other opponents, sometimes we couldn't, but this particular night we heard a do-or-die chant, whatever they were saying, and it was loud and it was purposeful. They were like war cries. He just, "Ahhh, ahhh!" Bang, bang and the way he was hitting them lockers, it just... if I wasn't in that zone preparing a fight, you know, I might have never entered the ring because it was truly bloodcurdling, the screams. Frank Sinatra was in the first row with the owner of Caesar's back then, along with his buddy 'Jilly' Rizzo. Frank Sinatra couldn't wait to meet Ray Mancini. Did you hear what I just said? Frank Sinatra, THE man, couldn't wait to meet Ray Mancini from 807 Cambridge Avenue. ANNOUNCER: Ray Mancini, led in by his manager Dave Wolf, his trainer Murphy Griffith entering the ring... The mindset of a fighter is a very intricate thing. How we prepare a fight, going into battle. I used to look at it as going to war. ANNOUNCER: Richard Green with the final instructions here. What I didn't know about Kim before the fight is that he wrote on his lampshade, "Kill or be killed." ANNOUNCER: Now there is the bell and we are under way and the Korean comes out swinging. I had mixed emotions about the fight because of the fact that I thought "Who is this kid?" I'd never heard of him. So I wasn't excited about the fight itself, but as I started to watch it, it started to become a very interesting fight. I thought "Gee, Ray, you know, "Ray's got his hands full with this guy." ANNOUNCER: This is a tough, tough fight. Duk-koo Kim came to fight. He was also, the same as Ray, he was a pressure fighter. Ray had more technique than him and was a bit more polished than Duk-koo Kim and perhaps hit a little harder. Ray is railing on him and hitting him with some great shots, but the last 30 seconds of the round, he would turn it around. It was just a war from the first round. And Ray had that little moment where he hit Kim three or four times and Kim raises his hands up in the air. ANNOUNCER: It is raise his hands and say, "Let's go!" I kept thinking it's one of those things you say and you don't mean, "You're gonna have to kill this kid to stop." In the eleventh round of that fight, we noticed the momentum changing and we saw Kim slowing down, but still he would flurry at the end. At one point, I looked at Duk-koo Kim and he was, to me, almost spiritually beaten and physically beaten. But then, he would come back. I mean, it was a most amazing display of heart, of soul, spirit. This guy didn't give up. There's something hauntingly fraternal about the confrontation between Ray and Kim. Kim's a southpaw. Ray's a natural southpaw. Ray's name, Mancino, means "southpaw". The only thing, the only agony, that Ray has to compare this to is fighting his own brother in the Navy Reserve gym. That's the closest Ray's come to this type of violence in the ring. Ray thought he could come out and take him out in the 13th. Forty-five unanswered punches that were landing, just not shots that were thrown that weren't landing, they were landing and they were landing hard. I was banging him pretty good and I'm thinking, "Referee's going to step in and stop the fight," but I'm getting arm-weary now and he comes right back. So Richard Green obviously couldn't stop it then. And at this point, I just threw 47 unanswered punches. By the end of the round, he's got me backing up. It's just incredible, his resiliency, his strength of body and spirit, it's just incredible. After the fight, I was laying on my bed and my eyes were swelled up and my hands were all swollen and my mother had a ice-pack on one eye here, on my hand here. My sister had it on the other eye, on the other hand, and my mother's crying over me. She's weeping and I'm looking at her, "Mum, Mum, don't cry. "It's okay. We won, we won!" Not long afterwards, my trainer, Murphy Griffith, came to the room. He said "Ray, we've got to talk, man. We've got to talk." And I said "Griff, what's up?" He said "Man, it don't look good." He said "This boy Kim, don't look like he's gonna make it." The day after the fight, I went home. When I got into the Cleveland Airport, we got met off the plane by reporters and cameramen, and friends of mine from Youngstown tried to protect me from the questions. They kept asking, you know, "How do you feel about Kim? "How do you feel that he's on life support?" How do I feel? How am I supposed to feel? How am I supposed to... I'm dying inside. I didn't leave my home for a couple of days. I couldn't get out of the house, I just was so depressed. I was losing my mind. I had to get out. So I went to a place and they put me in a corner table. Kind of stayed out of the way, but soon as people heard I was there, they come up to the table and one guy came up and said "Boom, hey, man, "I'm proud of you. Hey, what's it like to kill a guy?" "He's not dead, he's..." "Yeah, Boom, but you know it's gonna happen, so..." I mean, I couldn't believe the things I was hearing. You know, "What's it like to see that guy go down "and know that he's never gonna get up again?" Dr Lonnie Hammergren is the neurosurgeon on call and what he has in his notes is a haemorrhage that is really quite fresh. The haemorrhage causes enormous pressure in the brain. His theory is that it was caused, if not by the last blow, then one of the last blows 'cause there's no way he could have fought with a blood clot of that magnitude. I remember my father hugging me and just said "Just be thankful. Could have been you." And that really struck me, because it could have been. It truly could have been. And who's to say it wouldn't be me next time? You know, my style of fighting was not going to change. You know, my style was to come in and take punches to give punches. That bothered me. It stuck with me for the longest time. Before I could move on and decide whether I wanted to fight again, I had to come to grips with that. When I fought, I fought for righteous reasons. I fought to be a world champion for my father, to fight for the honour of my city, of Youngstown, Ohio. But after that fight, it took the love away from me, it took the honour away from me. To me, there was nothing righteous about it. But it's an honourable sport. You know, to me, it's nothing more pure than you have one man facing another man the same weight class and challenging himself physically, mentally, spiritually, emotionally, every which way. But that night, it took all the honour. It took all the love. It took everything away from me, that night. Ray was such a big, big draw. This fight was shown live on CBS and Saturday afternoon. Millions and millions of people were watching as a man died, in effect, in the ring. That's something that changes everybody. Three things happened in boxing in November 1982. First, Aaron Pryor knocks out Alexis Arguello, makes him unconscious, and there were a few very, very horrifying seconds at the end of that bout. Second, Randall 'Tex' Cobb takes a hell of a beating from Larry Holms, and Howard Cosell, who's announcing the fight, announces that this is an absolute disgrace and he's finished with boxing. Third, most dramatic, most tragic, is Mancini-Kim. And what happens is that the guy who had been the representative of everything that was virtuous in boxing now becomes an argument, Exhibit A, for its banishment. Suddenly, it became a matter of great national importance. And so much on the horizon for me. Right before the Kim fight I was being offered a national soft drink commercial, a national cereal commercial. I was on top of the world, man. I was riding the wave. And then after that, it all came crashing down. I was avoided like I was the plague. Every deal went away. I was a 21-year-old boy. The WBC immediately announces they're going to make championship fights that were 15 rounds, 12 rounds. It's not until much later that the WBA follows suit and by then it's a matter of convention, but everything leads back to Ray. After the Kim fight, I got in touch with my manager, David Wolf, and I said, "Dave, you know, let's get a fight as soon as possible." For me, I had to move on. I have to move on quickly. February 6, 1983, we got offered the fight in San Vicente, Italy. I was so looking forward to going to Europe and fighting in front of the Italian people. They've always showed a lot of love for me and a lot of support. But the press... I was fighting George Feeney, who was the European champion from England and you know, very tough fighter, but no matter what, it was always about Kim. On the eve of Ray's comeback fight in Italy, Duk-koo's mother takes her life. She ingests a bottle of pesticide. She's ashamed because the family has become embroiled in the battle over Kim's insurance money. She's ashamed because her own past as a woman with multiple marriages has come out. Later on, Richard Green kills himself. There's almost no evidence to think that Richard Green takes his life because he's despondent about Kim. I'm not saying that he was happy about it, but he didn't screw up. The great irony of the Mancini-Kim fight is that, but for the ending, it's a great fight. Every fight after the Feeney fight, no matter who it was that I was training for, always it would come back to the Kim fight. I couldn't get away from it. I learned to deal with it, but it wore thin on me. It wore thin and I just... I wondered were they ever going to let it go. I mean, I couldn't move forward in my career because they were always trying to pull me back. There's a lot of moral issues for him, I think. And then he said he never wanted to talk about it. He never wanted to hear his name, and we never did. We never even brought it up, nothing. We were not allowed to talk about it. He didn't say like, he didn't treat us like boys, "You're not allowed to talk about that." He just asked us, "Please, do not mention that fight. "We don't talk about that fight. Or if a reporter asks you, "you just say, 'No comment.'" They were relentless. They never let it go away, no matter when Ray fought next and he won, when Ray fought Bramble, Duk-koo Kim came up. They still talk about it now. You know, and it's never going to go away and it's never going to go away for Ray. Raymond being the soul that I know, I'm sure he was greatly affected by Duk-koo Kim's death. I also know Ray's an intelligent guy and he knows that he wasn't 100 percent responsible for that. It wasn't anything maliciously it happened. It was two warriors got in there. Just as easily, that could have happened to Raymond. I think Ray never was a fighter after the Duk-koo Kim fight that he was before. The exuberance and the joy that he went into a fight was gone. What hurt Ray so badly after the Kim tragedy was the fact that he was seen as this all-American boy, wanted him in our living rooms, you know, would have dated our daughters. And then it was a certain betrayal. "Oh, he's a killer. He killed a guy." Other fighters have killed fighters in the ring and went on, you know, without that stigma. It's been talked to death, man. It's been talked over and over, so much there's nothing more to say. I've answered every question every possible way. I'm strong. I'm good. What bothers me more than anything is that, you know, things that have been said to my children. My daughter was in fourth grade when a young boy called, said, "Your father's a murderer." And she'd come home crying to me, saying, "Poppy, why do they say these things?" Not long ago, a boy said to my son, he said, "Hey, I heard your father killed somebody." I can deal with it. I've dealt with it. But my children, they shouldn't have to deal with it. It hurts. I mean, my father is not a murderer. It affects me sometimes, but now, I think, being older, it will have less effect on me, but I'm still hurt by it, that people say it. So... Growing up it was hard, 'cause you... I didn't really understand people always coming up to me and telling me this, telling me that. I didn't know. But growing up, I understood. You know, it was part of his job. It's what you had to do. It's unfortunate what happened, but um, my dad did his job. And, I mean, I accepted what happened. My father is very compassionate and cares a lot about other people. You know, he's always nice to people even when they're rude. He's always the nice guy, tries to be, you know, the Good Samaritan, so something like that deeply affected him. When I was doing my research and reporting in Korea, Jaiwan told me that he wanted to meet Ray. So I asked Ray "How do you feel about it?" Ray wanted to meet him. I think he felt and still feels some ambivalence about it, but I think Ray thinks it's something he needs to do, if only because this boy, now a man, wants it. And I think like most things with Ray, most good things with Ray, it's done out of a very virtuous sense of duty. I also think he wants some closure. You know, it's peculiar, because Ray starts out as the good son. He's going to redeem his father. And now, what he finds himself at some level needing... is the blessing of a son and it's not just any son, it's the son of a man he killed. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Yes, please. Nice to meet you. If... I wish I had more things to say. But my heart is full. My heart is full. I'm so happy to finally meet you. If it's okay, can I introduce you to my children? Yes. Hello. My daughter Nina. Nice to meet you. This is my son Ray and my son Leo. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. So, this is Jaiwan. Well, I will tell you everything you want to know. I will tell you everything about when I was... when they asked me to fight your father. I will tell you everything about before the fight. I'll tell you everything you want to know. Yeah, I remember. The only time I met your father was here before the fight, the press conference and in the ring. That's it. But I felt I knew him better than anybody, better than your mother, better than his best friend, because I knew what was in his heart. You know, he was a warrior, and in the boxing game, you may never see each other before and never see each other after, but for those moments, you know each other better than anybody. I never thought of ever quitting in any fight, of course. The only fight I ever thought of quitting was in the fight against your father. I was very proud and very honoured to have been in the ring with your father. He's a true warrior, and he brought the best out in me. He brought the best out in me. I appreciate that. Thank you. I... you know, Jaiwan, I felt guilty about his... about what happened, for a long time. I felt guilty because your mother, and then, of course, when you were born, I felt guilty that you would never meet your father. But I was able to make peace with it. Your father is always going to be a part of me now and I'm always going to be part of his memory and the Korean people have treated me wonderful. They've shown me nothing but love, so I appreciate that very much and the fact that you and your mother come here and um, to share this with me and my family, it, uh, it does... it's a very... I appreciate it very much. I think it was important for Jaiwan to meet the man that was the last man to be in the ring with his father. It was important for him to let me know how he felt early in his life and how he feels now. I wanted him to know what type of man his father was. It was very hard for me to meet Young Mi, only because the man that she was hoping to spend the rest of her life with died at my hands. I couldn't have asked for a better meeting. It's put closure for me in so many aspects and the fact that they got to meet my children, that's helped me in a tremendous way and I believe it'll help my children. I've had times my brother has come to me in my dreams, and so has Kim. I do believe I've been able to make peace with my brother and make peace with Kim. I lived with guilt about the Kim incident for so long. I've made peace with things. I've come to grips, come to terms and I move on. You know, life's too short, man. Life's too short. You got to enjoy every day. Captions (c) SBS Australia 2013
