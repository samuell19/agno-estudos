A few weeks ago, using wacky medical science tech, Narrator: Rio Uchida Nero Aoi operated on her classmates and conquered the school and conquered the school and conquered the school. But at the hands of Giko Nokomura and friends, she met a tragic end. Peace, it seemed, was restored to school. We didn't have to be friends. But there's no need to kill each other. It's wild time! It's the no-fun student council! Get your claws off me! Dictator Nero is vanquished. Learning from her mistakes, the new council desires schnool peace. Nemesis! Where do you see peace? Never forget. We use violence to attain peace. The arrested students were taken to the Uguisu School Jukai Forest School Council Prison. the Uguisu School Jukai Forest School Council Prison. It's a huge nature-based prison of a scale not commonly attributed to educational institutions. Bloody Chainsaw Girl Returns: Giko Awakens Which way? Hey, hey! Isn't that... Giko! Keep away from me. You'll regret this! Wait, Drie. We can't help her. But we have to try, Ms. Senzaki. Very well. You guys! What? Wow. As always. What? It's field goal time! No... I'm back! Long time no see, Naglucifer. Yeah. You know each other? We're old friends. Why did you come to the prison? I'm on day duty. Day duty? My job is to feed the prisoners. But with this fighting I can't finish. They think you're feed. Whatever. Let's go back. How? I've no idea. I see You've been tricked. This is where they lock up violent people like you. And where they crucify you too. Help! Drie! Hey! Crap! Giko, you can't search blindly. Want me to give up? Want me to give up? I'll get the bastards who took her away against her will. How'll you do that? - Do you hear something? Melon! Sorry to interrupt your fun, but did you see a girl with a drill hand? This is a Melon show! Like we care? Shut up! Go home! Kindly calm down! - Yes, we should. - Be quiet. We are many while they are but three. They're no doubt scared due to the scolding you gave them. We're sorry! It's alright. We should probably grab them while they're still scared. Wait! We're just looking for a girl... You're saying you're not my fans? This is a dangerous place, everyone but my fans are my enemies. Melon is too scared to live. Yes, we must create a utopia with Melon! We must capture all enemies! Indeed! Help us! For now, let's just pretend to be fans. - Let's go. - Right. Help us! “Enemy or Ally"? That's nuts. They're escaping! Catch them! - Let go! - Our enemies! Come on! Mr. Ishii! No! They're human, not mutant cyborgs! So what? Kill them and you'll go to real prison. Crap! Mr. Ishii! You'll go on a charge of battery! We're searching for our friend. We're not bugging you. So stay the hell out of our way. Don't let them go! Everyone, never forget that it was violence like this that took my life. You died once? Killed by a lunatic Melon fan! That means...she’s a mutant cyborg. When Mistress Nero brought me back, I swore to never surrender to violence. My fans, there's no need to imprison them. So just kill them! What? They're dangerous and killed Mistress Nero! Sure, but how? I gave you glow sticks for times like this. Push the bottom button. Like this? Are those lightsab...? Let's do away with violence for peace. Hurry! But using them will make us murderers. You'd put me at risk again? See, there's no time. But what about us? What? What about the risk to us? What? If we fight, we could die, too. Of course, Melon is our everything. But please think about us a little? We want a utopia... - Right. - Right. Utterly useless. You're all utterly useless! Why is it always me? Mr. Ishii! You're worthless if I can't use you! You're worthless if I can't use you! Just fight and die for me! What a thing to say! These are your fans! Sure, I'm thankful for my fans. They're nutrients for my idol flowers. Otherwise, you're just plain shit! More serious! "Prisoner Personal Effects Room” "Prisoner Personal Effects Room” Personal effects? Stop doing this. I could die! Do this and I won't be your fan anymore. You've no right to quit being fans. Nutrients don't run from flower beds. Do you quit being a fan when learning of an idol's sex affair? Do you quit being a fan when learning of an idol's sex affair? Do you quit being a fan when learning of an idol's sex affair? You even force her to apologize. Why do pop idols gotta apologize to you pieces of shit? Do you know what "fan" means? It comes from "fanatic"! You've confused it with "fun"! Show some enthusiasm! Too cruel. More! More nutrients! Turd licker. What? You force others to risk all, while you lounge about in a safe space! You're turd lickers too for letting her do this to you! You cool with this? Look at their satisfied faces. They've nowhere else to go. Turd... Licker... - Leader? - Leader! - Turd licker! - Leader? What? No! You blockheads! Melon! No kicking! No pulling! Well then... Stop, don't kick. It's in your hands. You stupid blockheads! Time for a weeding. Flowers can't bloom without nutrients. Don't forget this, Ms. Pop Idol. Fuck! You cXXt! Let me go! Freaking, fuckin’ cXXt whores! Screw you! Screw you! CXXts! You'll regret this! She screams great. Mutant cyborgs will soon come out. When they take Melon, we'll follow them to where Drie is possibly being held. It's that easy? We can with these confiscated items. Where did you...? Let me look it over first. Come on. I'll give you this first. Hey! Crap, they've already taken her. Oh. Her right leg. Watch out. Stop that. Melon is scattered about. In that direction. There's hope yet. Let's follow them. There. A mutant cyborg. Hey, where's the switch? You push here. And here. Stop, they'll come if they hear you. Got you! Senzaki! Some yummy looking girls. Crap! Bastards! Huh? You alright? - Sorry. - Yeah. She's not here. You did more than look it over. I knew you'd notice. The kickback is a weak point. It's now maximized for the next attack. I made original drive links. I see you shaved down the 59AC. I want to show Drie. Not only that... Put a sock in it. It's my chainsaw. Sorry, but Melon became like that in a split second. This Drie girl must already be dead. To honor Drie's spirit, we must escape alive. Think realistically. Finding Drie and finding her alive is a dream. Thinking only with your head is like dreaming! But we act so as to make it reality, don't we? I don't get it. For example, bet you don't know how much we love machine tools. ‘Cause you can't see in here. sure. But please see that we will go rescue our friend who loves tools and is probably already dead. Well, can you understand that? We have to act. That's how we make the things in our head real. If she’s dead, it'll be revenge. That's all. I got it. Prisoners of the student council It's time for bed. Good night. Wake up time is six tomorrow morning. I repeat... Who pays attention to this? What is it? Watch this. Wake up time is six tomorrow morning. So what? The person speaking is someone on duty, or Nemesis. It's worth checking out. I think we hit bingo. If Nemesis is in there, can we assume Drie is as well? Let's go. What are you doing? - Hey. - Wait, stop! Lower your head! Got a panty flash... You leave me no choice. Come on! Incredible. Gross. It's too much. Excuse me. What? I don't know why, but... You! Where's Drie? Drie? Oh, that girl. I don't know. Go threaten me but I don't know. Mutant cyborgs took her. Oh, now I know. Then she must be dead. Wait! She'll know where the gate is. I've found it already. OK. Kill her. Wait! I can't hear you! Your agony filled face makes me feel sorry for you. Who is she? I won't forgive you! Nemesis Wand! What the? Transformation complete! Magical Girl Nemesis is here! Magical Girl Nemesis is here! I zap away bad guys! What the hell? What is it? A Saturday morning cartoon leftover? I punish those who don't believe in magic! Enough of this! One, two... Magic? Magical Girl Nemesis is a magic girl who controls time. What's that mean? You'll lose if you just attack blindly! But how can I beat magic? I'm not done yet. Wait. This may not be magic. What then? Floating things and controlling time are unrelated. It's my opinion her wand controls gravity. Oh boy! I don't get it, but that sure made her face go sour. By controlling gravity, she made you heavy and suspended things. So what if you know. As you put it, think. I believe she doesn't come to trust anyone easily. She takes precautions In case she's betrayed. Nemesis should have a weak point too. She should, but... Push the pedal on the side. What? It's a guitar effects pedal that alters sound. So? So, the pedal changes sound. And then? It gets cooler! It's having no effect. This wouldn't do crap for anyone! I thought it'd buy time! In what universe? It's time to say good-bye. Huh? Wait, wait. What happened? Dead battery. For your info, I have a spare! Time to change the battery! Let's see... Well? Won't open... I can't open it. Anyone have a screwdriver? The battery lid is shut by screws. No, hold on, guys! Damn, what'll I do? Ow! Hey. - Hey! - What? Stay in character! Nero gave her a chic weak point. Don't feel relieved. I kept order here. What was squashed with violence will soon be out of control. She's dead. Nemesis was a tough cookie too. She said what she squashed with violence will be out of control What was that gravity device anyway? I think this is a real innovation. Indeed What? Let's go. Stop! This way! No! Stop what you're doing! No good. The gate is in the southeast corner. Let's hurry. What about Drie? - You're just... - Don't even. You know, don't you? You act as if you alone possess hope. It's unfair. Let's hurry. No, she's alive. What? Drie? Hey! Follow her! Drie! Drie! Drie! Drie! Nero? You're still alive, Nero. Nero? You see... I live peacefully within the forest. Please turn around and go back the way you came. No way, her memory is... Yes, I have no memory. What I do remember is... being near death because of you pud kissers! That was a lame trick. Whaddaya want, dumbass? I lost to you just as I had planned. Planned? “Search & Destroy!” Hearing the news of my death, some mutant cyborgs got cocky. I identified and eliminated them to bring order back to the school. You helped me find the traitors! The cockiest of all was Nemesis. Thank you for disposing of her for me. Well, tell me who mourned your death? I don't need anything like that. Is poor ol’ you hurting a bit? Are you a dumbass? Did you get hurt? Too bad for you! Drie! Drie! Drie! - Drie. - Are you alright? Wait! This one should be for meat. You... What did you do to her? Is she your precious friend? Try not to hurt her. She's no friend of mine. Let's do it, Giko. Ready? Well.. Help me, Giko! Wait! Nero operated on me and I feel odd, like I'm a different person. Drie. Like a different person! Help me, please revert me back. We're doomed, so make a choice. You mean kill her? It's alright. I'll do that. Wait! - Senzaki was hurt! - I know that! - Move! - I said wait! Hey, are you serious? Let go, I'll do it. Let go, I'll do it. I said let go! She's too much for you! I said I'd do it. I'm sorry. Please kill me. Wow. Aren't you all Just so chummy wummy. Why don't you just die as you wallow in the pit of your fake friendship! We're not close. I hate punk girls and don't understand how people can hit others. What? I kinda like doing that. I hate those who fight with weapons. I like being on my own. What's it mean? It means, we unite when we have a common enemy! Hold strong. After she's gone you'll get cooler ones! Giko and Nero kept on fighting. Their reason for fighting no longer mattered. Their reason for fighting no longer mattered. They were just bashing their chainsaws together. Powerfully and violently. As if in response to the violence, the rain grew harder and harder. Hold it! - Giko. - Giko. Giko. You okay? - Come on. - Are you alive? You're all pretty gory looking. Nero, you too. I see the moon in red tonight. Fucking rain... What'll we do with her body? We'll bring her back. What? We need her brain to fix Drie. In her lab we may be able to restore her. You can bring her back? Yes. If not, we can't fix Drie. We're all like this because of you. We've no choice. Then fix her yourself. What? That's why I hate punks! That has nothing to do with nothing! What did you say? Thanks for everything and... Not sure if we can get home. Well, how do we go back? Hitchhike? No one's gonna give you a lift looking like that. You're like an ogre. Red ogres are tough. That means? Nero's gone! He thought she was trash. It's ‘cause you left it there! Hey wait! Who is that guy? - Hold it! - Wait! Give Neo back to us!
