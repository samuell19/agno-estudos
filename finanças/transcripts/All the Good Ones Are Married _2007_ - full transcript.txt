- Damn. Damn. Damn. Fucking loser. Trey. Trey. She spent the night. - I'm sleeping. - Don't you have work? - Damn it. Giving me a fucking headache. - Well if you pound down a 12 pack it happens. - Bitch what bit your ass? - Climbing over random bodies. - Well she's your friend. - Jesus I am trying to brush her off. - Today's your thing huh? Yeah, my thing. - Well, get going. Don't be a witch, they could still throw your ass in jail. Mine? - Yeah, you're the one they caught her princess. - Wish me luck. - Good luck. Hey Kayla, you awake? - Guys, to Alex, for negotiating three months pay in maternity leave. - Thanks I love you all, now eat the cake. Finally okay I've got to go. Excuse me. - Hi hon. - Alex, listen-- - I can't talk right now I'm late for Jack. - Alex. - I love you hon, bye. - Ben Customer says there's a hair in her tortellini. - Must be the one with the long red spirally curls? How'd you know? - Well, it's a bit of a give away wouldn't you say? Give her another tortellini. I have an appointment, I'll see you later. - What happened? - I overslept. - You know how important this is right? - I'm sorry. - Okay, let's hurry. I'll take that. Hi. - Alex, you're late. - 40 years this is a family business. I know everybody's name, I know their kids, their husbands. When they get sick I look out for them, that's what family does. Family does not steal. - Well I'm glad you brought that up Jack, family, because one thing that family does is they give you a second chance. Don't you love that poem, how does it go? Home is a place where when you get there they have to forgive and forget. - Don't overdo the metaphors. I'm running a business here. Where'd you get that bag? - Zoe made it. - Nice. - Yeah. - Are those my materials too? - Jack. - I deserved it. - Call her back, I'll be responsible for her. 40 years, never so much as a security card. - She made a mistake. Jack she's incredibly talented. Please give her a break. - Miss Miller. Would you be so kind as to take a seat? I had intended on announcing this later but you women have forced my hand. Alex you're taking the rest of the year off to design and market your own line. - Jack. - And if Alex wants to hire you back then that's her lookout. - You're hired. - Now one minute Miss Miller. If there are any more problems even Alex won't be able to save your job. - I learned my lesson Mr. Ross. I promise I'm going to pay you back, every penny. Good, 'cause if you rip me off again you're going to jail. - I understand. - Good. Let's get back to work shall we? Yes. - We just closed a seven figure deal on our latest book before publication. - Hi Fay. - Hi Alex how are you? - Great is my husband around? - Oh he left, doctor's appointment I think. - Okay, well thanks I'll see you. Okay, bye. - I can't tell you how ready I am for this. - Good because if Random House picks up your novel with your looks you're the next John Irving. I don't know about that. - Well that was the good news. The not so great news is that you've only got a five month window to finish. - Five months? - You can do it Ben, you've got the talent and the desire. All you need now is the commitment and that means writing full-time. - Lauren, full time as in quit my job full time? Lauren if it were just me, but I can't. - This is a once in a lifetime shot Ben. Your wife has gotta understand that. - No one's ever had faith in me before. I think I'd feel better if you'd lower your expectations a little considering I barely got through community college. - That's better than me. Thank you. I dropped out of my sophomore year to get married. - Now you're like running a company. - Trying. How do you feel about working from your apartment? - Great, why? - A little underhanded scheme I have to try to show Jack how flex time works. - Flex time? - My current mission in life. See with flex time you can do all or some of your work from home and working moms don't have to decide between putting food on the table or spending time with their kids. And studies show that productivity doesn't even drop off. - You're such a good person. - No it's purely self interest. I never have enough time for Ben and the kids. - You sound like my mom. Between work and rehab. Maybe not exactly like my mom. - Your mom's in rehab? - You name it, she's been addicted to it, but this time I hope to have my own place by the time she's out and take care of her. - That's nice. - Mom would freak if she knew about my new job. She's always saying, forget about designing, it's a pipe dream. - No, no. - She thinks I should find some rich guy and get married. - You don't want to settle down to young. - Thanks to you I have a shot at a career. - Luke, Luke over here. Dad move, Luke quick. I got it. - Tight defense, tight defense. - Luke, oh. Guys, Mom's home Dad I'm gonna tell her. - Luke don't. - Let him. - Bad idea Dad. - Hey, Dad's gonna be famous. - Shut up butt head. Madison, language. - And he quit his job. - That's not even funny. Hi hon. - Hi. - I stopped by the restaurant. - You stopped by? - Yeah for a celebration. You first, where were you? Dad tell her. - Lauren took me to the plaza for lunch where a small coke cost 15 bucks. Dad. - And the men's room has free breath mints and hair gel. - Just tell her. - Tell me what? - Random House read the first five chapters of my book and they're very interested. Ben. Oh honey I'm so happy, now there's two reasons to celebrate. And I want to eat. - Okay something festive. - Pizza? - Yes pizza. - See, told you Mom's cool. - Of course I'm cool. - Maddy thought you'd freak about the job. - Guys, Ben, you're kidding right? You really quit your job? 4,000 on credit cards, two mortgages at a total of 3,200 a month, a balance of exactly zero in our savings account and we're into imaginary numbers on our checking account. - Alex I really need your support now. Look it's just five months. - And we're so close to the edge. I mean what happens if something in my job were to change and I wasn't-- - Oh come on Jack couldn't find his way out of the men's room without you. I need this Alex. I'm 43 years old and I'm dying on the vine. - You've got such a great job and you're so good at it. - Alex, when I'm writing is the only time I feel passion about anything. - When you put it that way. We'll make it work. You won't change your mind when the money gets tight? - Ben it's Random House. - I love you. - I'm starving, let's go see if the kids left us anything. - Hey you didn't tell me what you were celebrating. - I can't even remember. Compared to this come on are you kidding. Let's go, hungry? - Yeah. - Oh man did you at least tell him what you're passing up so he can be Ernest Hemingway? - I couldn't, he was so excited. - Well you at least have to benefit from the marital guilt. What you're doing for him, he should clean the house for the next 20 years. - Well seriously Jack what if we just scaled back the plan a little bit? I mean Zoe Miller is a handbag genius so we can just start with that and I will keep my day job for a while? - Well if that's what you want it's fine by me. But Alex take it from an old hand, be open with your husband. - Gee Dr. Phil I'd love to delve into this some more but I got a meeting. - Yeah, too bad marriage is not an administrative job huh? - Well sometimes you make sacrifices. He doesn't have to mop the floor for my support. - Come on we're late. Let's go guys. - Piece of cake, it's just five minutes away. - Mom I'm fine. - Okay. - Mom, come on, hurry. - Hello? - Alex it's Zoe, do you have a second? - Sure go ahead, Mom? I gotta question about work. - Are you alright? - Yes, yes. - You have to get that checked. - I know, I will. - I can't hear you, are you there? - I gotta call you back. Oh my god. - Hey, hey, hey, what the hell? - I hate you! - Stop it. Please tell me this isn't ours. - Mom brought a friend home to live. - Yeah right. - Some girl from work. - I need that space. - She's got nowhere else to go. - Oh come on, I've already set up there Alex. - Honey she's only 24, her mother's in rehab. I didn't think that you would mind working in the house. - Well maybe you didn't think about me period. - Oh Ben. - Look I am not comfortable with a stranger living in our house. We have Luke, we have Madison to think about. - She's great, you guys are gonna love her and plus honey it's either us or the street. - Ah come on. Fine, but dibs on the apartment. She gets the spare bedroom. - Okay. - Hey. You must be Ben? I'm Zoe, your new housemate. Is this okay, did I do something, is this okay? - Oh help yourself to anything of course. Oh great you met and these are the kids. Kids this is Zoe, Zoe Madison, Luke. - Hey. - Hi. - Oh and there's been a change with the apartment. - No, no change. - Oh, okay. - Are you sure this is cool with Ben? - Cool, it's down right chillin'. - Mom. You'll have to forgive her she tries but fails to be cool. - I am cool, aren't I Luke? - Yeah, whatever Mom. - What? - Am in your space? - No, it's okay. - You don't look like it's okay. - Ignore that. Tight deadline you know, a lot of stress. - Well, I won't get in your way. You won't even know I'm here. - Good. - Can I help you with that Mr. Gold? - No, I'm good. Call me Ben. - Lose your key? - I need the rest of my stuff. - Where you staying? What you don't want to tell me? - What's the point? We're done. - That's cold. - Yeah, you blaming me? - Give me a break Zoe I was drunk, she came on to me. - Did she take the pictures too? Just forget it Trey. - So you got somebody else already? - It's none of your business. - You screwing somebody else for a place to live? - Go to hell! You'll be back when he kicks you out. - I hope I die first. - Yeah. Yeah you'll be back. Hey you'll back but it might be too late! - Hey Glen. - Hey, time sheets? - Check those out, Zoe Miller designs, all done flex time from my garage apartment. - Wow, awesome. - Awesome comes when we're all on flex time. - I worship you. - As you should. - How's that going by the way, Zoe staying with you guys? - Good I guess, I don't know. I'm here to eight or nine these days. - Okay, how's Ben feel about that? - He's adjusting. - That's mine. Sorry. - I just needed the dryer that's all. - Give me a second and I'll get out of your way. Busted, I'm so sorry. - What'd you think? - What do I think? It's incredible, I didn't want to put it down. You're so smart too. What does this mean anyway, myriad? - Many. - Many, like I have myriad nail polishes. - A virtual plethora of polishes. - I was so lame at Freshman Comp, I bought all my papers on the internet. - Did you? Whatever you do don't tell the kids. - I'm sure they already know about it. Just-- - There's more tuna in the kitchen, help yourself. - Pass, I'd rather eat Pavement Pizza. Drive the porcelain bus, barf, which is by way what your sandwich smells like. - Well, now you've increased my vocabulary regrettably. I sent it back unopened. - Your mom goes like 24/7. - Well that's what they told me to do. - She needs a phone surgically attached to her ear. - Yes it's marked return to sender. - The dance is on Saturday. - Okay so I'll deduct 87.50 from the balance too. Thank you. - All the chaperones are dressing up. - Oh they are? - Please tell me you're not going to wear one of those man suits of yours? - I don't wear man suits. - God Mom just tattoo loser on my forehead right now. - Oh Madison are we really so caught up in appearances, so superficial? - Well when everyone knows you're my mom, yeah. - What happened to world hunger? Okay, I'll go shopping. - I have a dress you could wear. - Oh. - Enter, your mom's modeling for us. - Oh. - I can't come out like this. - Mom stop. - Just pretend it's Halloween. - Oh Mom. - Ooh. - I need a full body mask. - Alex you're a stone hottie. - You're not actually wearing that in public? - To the dance. - Well, she can't. Dress normal. - He's right, I mean it's beautiful, thank you Zoe, but I'll find something else I promise. - But Mom-- - Did Zoe see your dress yet? - Want to? - Totally. - Okay. - Wow. - Oh, honey close the door, hurry. Don't worry I'm changing right away. - No, no, no, no, no keep that on. Let me have a look. - Oh. - Oh sweetheart. - It's way too short, it's ridiculous. I'm so embarrassed and our poor son is gonna need therapy after he saw this. - Come with me. - What? But the kids. - We're going to bed and you and I we're past due. - Don't worry the payment's good 'til-- - Yeah. And you're gonna rehearse. - You know what would make me really excited? - Please tell me. - Wrapping my lips around-- - Oh baby. - A hot steaming cup of cocoa in my biggest flannel pajamas. - That's not funny. - Yes it is. - Why don't you want to have sex with me? - Oh don't be ridiculous. Oh honey you're serious. I'm sorry, it's just I'm exhausted. - Don't spend 12 hours at the office. - Well it's been a busy time. - You have time for work, for the kids, for afterschool activity, for Zoe's career. Why do you look at me like that? Have you even asked me about my book? - I didn't want to pressure you. - When was the last time we had a quiet dinner together? Or sex? Think about it. - Hey honey. - Hey. - About last night. - Yeah, don't worry about it, it's okay. - How about you and I make a date? You know a date? - That sounds good. - Yeah? - How about Friday night? - Pencil me in. - Okay. Hmm, what about tonight? - Maybe handsome. - Kids have gone to school. Have a great day. - I'll try. - Pass it, pass, pass. - Hey guys. - Hey there. Want to play? - Yeah, be right down. Okay. - How about guys against girls? Sounds like a plan. - Okay. - I'm down. Cool. Dad. Yeah. - Come on Madison get in the game. - Genuine vintage circa-- Food. The 1940's perfect. 5,000 units, oh that's cool. Great, wait 'til the designer hears about this. Thank you, bye. World War Two coat buttons, enough for the entire first run. - That's awesome. Do you know what I really love? Designer. Kung Pao? - Please. - Save some for me. - Every man for himself. - I know you're hungry Dad. They've been playing since like three. - Four hours? - Oh I didn't realize, that went by really fast. - Where is the brown rice? I know I ordered some brown rice. There's only white here. - I'm sorry Alex. My poster child for flex time. - Give her a break boss, she's an artist, there's no on switch. - She's got a job Ben and a deadline. - We've all got deadlines Alex. - Mom why did you have to do that? - Why'd you, you started it. - Shut up. - Can we all just forget about it and eat? Thank you, drop it. - I'm not hungry. - Go ahead Luke it's okay. - Gold residence. Oh hey Alex. I was making dinner to surprise you. Okay. Okay I'll tell him, bye. - Well look at you making dinner. - Yeah, good thing it's the thought that counts. Alex is gonna be late. - What else is new? - Don't be like that. This guy at work had his heart seriously broken and she's taking him out for drinks. - This is for you. - Oh. - And I hope it doesn't make you ride the porcelain bus. - What is it? Word a day? I love it, thank you. - Yeah. - I love it. Let's find one. Vermicular, the state of being worm eaten. - I knew things weren't great. She wanted more romance, travel, money. She didn't know what she wanted. - Sounds like there's not a lot you could've done. She obviously wasn't ready to settle down. Yeah except she left me for a guy with a better job who's older than me. - You can't worry about that Glen, you're a bonafide catch. - I am, a catch? - Yeah of course. You're good looking, you're thoughtful, you've got a great job. She obviously was just too young to recognize it. - I like that. Let's hope maybe that's the last time I ever hookup with anyone in her 20's. - That's probably wise. - Yep I'm gonna try my luck with an older woman. - Hello. - How's Glen? - Better. Too bad you guys work together I could fix you up. Kids in bed? - Yeah. Their surrogate mom tucked them in. - Thanks. And she cooks. - Yeah well she's gonna make someone a great wife some day. - Actually spends time here. - Don't do that. - Hey. - Hey. - I'm sorry about-- - Forget it. It's just not a good idea to joke about stuff so close to home. Why are you looking at me like that? - Does it make you uncomfortable? - Yes. - Sorry. - I probably shouldn't say this but-- - What? Come on, you can't do that, that's torture. - Fine. It's just after this I don't know how I'm gonna date guys my age again. - Zoe. - Alex is lucky, I'm jealous. - You don't have to make me feel so good about myself. - I'm not. - That's awfully sweet. - I better go. - Morning honey. Have a great day. - Hey, you got a minute? - Sure. - I think we should make time for a marriage councilor. - Counseling? - Do you think we're doing okay? - I did. I'm... Can we talk about this a little more? - Sure, I didn't mean to dump it on you. - But isn't this just normal stress? - Not to me. - I don't really know anything about counseling. I don't even know if it's covered. - It's a just a call to your personnel department. - Oh I have to call? - Alex it is your insurance. - Well yeah it's my insurance, but you're the one who's home all day. - I'm working too. You know what gets me, the time you have for strangers, for people at work is limitless. Oh stop. - But no when I ask you for a blip of time-- I gotta work. - Honey don't forget your lunch. Thanks, okay, bye. Hey. - Quick question. A door closer huh? - What do you think about getting involved with someone you work with? - That doesn't exactly fall under the category of quick questions. - I didn't say a quick answer. - I think it's begging for trouble. - Oh. Well that's not the answer I wanted. - It's the only answer I've got. Hello? - Hey, I know this is getting to be somewhat of a habit, but I'm sorry about this morning. - Yeah, me too. - And I do want to talk about counseling. - Thank you Alex. - Let's not wait 'til Friday. How about dinner tonight, just us? - Sure, that sounds like a great idea. Maybe we can go for a drive and hold hands. - I love you. - I love you. - Bye. - Is that a new hairdo? - No Mom, nothing new and improved. - Oh, you look beautiful. But distracted. - Oh I'm fine. - This is your mother Alex. How are the kids, Ben? - He's fine. "He's fine." Okay maybe we're in a little bit of a slump. Yeah. - Do you want to talk about it? - He just seems unsettled and I love our life. I just assumed he did too. - Well, I think that the writing's got him on edge honey don't blame yourself. - And things can't be all that bad, we've got a dinner date tonight. - Oh good. How's things with the endodontist? - You mean the lying rat? Do you believe this, the man is pushing 70 and he's stringing along two women. - What? - Mm-hmm. Honey it used to be all the good ones are married. Now they're all dead. I never thought I would end up alone. - Mom you're not alone, you got us. - Yeah I know but, they're not-- - Mom are you okay? - Oh, yeah I'm okay. Well. - Mom you've got to go to a doctor and get help. - I know honey, you know what I just hate running to the doctor for, oh for every little thing. Mom? Mom. - Alex I think I need a little girl's room. - Oh Mom, oh no, Mom. Oh no. Take a breath. Hello, help, help, could you help us? - I'm really fine, there's no need for us to be here. - There's no signal. - Alex I don't want to keep you here. - I need to find a payphone. - Honey if you need to be somewhere would you please go? - Mom I'm not leaving without you. - If I stay we both know what's gonna happen and it's gonna change everything. - I don't want to hurt Alex. - Nor do I. - Ben it's Alex, where are you? - I've gotta go, what is it? - Alex got home, did you think that wasn't gonna happen? - Did you? - Where have you been? - I waited, waited at the restaurant. - I had to take Mom to the emergency room. - Oh what's wrong? - I don't know, she passed out. I think she's diabetic or hypoglycemic or... They gave her some fluids and they released her. Is it serious? - I was so scared. - Hello? - Hey Zoe. - Hey Alex. - Can I look at the work? - Sure, yeah. - I'll be right out. - No problem. - Hey. - Hey. I'm not done yet. - Okay, well don't stress, but the end of the week would be great. - I'll try. - Good. What? - I'm really tired, is that okay? - Yeah, sure. - No I, yes Lauren I understand. I know they're anxious. I'll email you what I've got Lauren. Right, all the new chapters, yeah okay, bye. - How can you be such a bastard? You haven't even looked at me in three days. - I'm sorry. I didn't want to hurt you but we can't do this. - Funny how that hits you after you get what you want. - Don't you feel guilty? - Yes, but that doesn't make you any less of a jerk. - Come here. Look, you are so beautiful, if you only knew how much, how great you made me feel. I could have sex with you right here right now but that's not what this is about, okay? So you said. - Look, we're friends and we took this too far, does that make sense to you? - How does that work? - We had sex in the house I share with my wife and my children. We can't do that again. That can't happen again Zoe, okay? Okay? - Why is my life so screwed up? - No, no, don't, don't. - Why doesn't anybody love me? - Don't, don't. Don't-- - What's wrong with me? - There's nothing wrong with you. We're trying to be good people here okay? We're just trying to be good people. Trying to do the right thing. - I don't care how bad it feels. - No, no Zoe, Zoe, Zoe we can't do this. - I need you. This is Zoe, I'm not here right now, but if you want to you can leave a message. It's Alex. She wants to go to dinner. - How's she sound? - Happy. - The biggest trade show of the year is in Hawaii. It's every year, it's the top vendors, the latest designs, materials, I never miss it. You are coming with me. - Oh my god. Oh my god Alex. - I know, I know, I have been so proud of you. You've kept all my faith in you. - Alex you don't really know me. - What's the matter Zoe? I've noticed for a while now, you can tell me. - God can't you see what's going on? I'm sleeping with Ben. I'm sorry. Please say something. - Don't you dare ask me for anything, after all I've done for you. I took you into my home. I'm such an idiot. At work, I'm supporting him, supporting my family, taking you out of the gutter and you're sleeping with my husband and you have the nerve to sit at my table with my children? - Alex we didn't want it to happen. - Don't, don't insult me with trite. You get your things out my house, do you hear me? Tonight. Can we have the check please? - I'll get it. - You hold onto your money Zoe. You're gonna need it because you're out of a job. I want you to leave now, tonight. - Alex we need to talk. - I'm not interested in your justifications. - Just tell me what I need to do to get through to you Alex. - You see this is exactly what I won't listen to. Cheating was your cry for help. Your cold indifferent wife made you. - If you only knew how much I wish this did not happen. - It didn't happen, you did it. - You brought her into this house. - Please. - Look into your heart and you tell me that bringing Zoe here had nothing to do with our relationship with you not wanting to be intimate with me. - That's disgusting. - Alex, Alex. - Let go of me. - You abandoned me. You've got your job, your kids, your house, your good deeds. You don't need me, you don't even see me! - Let go of me. But I didn't cheat on you. Your father and I haven't been getting along lately. I don't want you to think that it has anything to do with you. You kids are the best thing we ever did together. - Where is he? - I don't know yet. I was angry and I asked him to leave, but you can call him on his cellphone. - Mom what did he do? - Luke, Zoe's gone too. - Oh Madison. Oh. - Don't cry Mom, no, no don't cry. - I won't. - It's gonna be alright. - Come here sweetie. Everything's gonna be fine. There's food in the fridge for dinner. Do you guys have everything? Okay. - Surreal. - I knew this would happen. - Could you step out of the car please? Let's see some ID. - It's in my car. - This your current address? - No. - You've got a current address? - Yeah. - 'Cause we had a complaint, somebody sleeping in a car. Family neighborhood, you can't do that type of thing here. - Yeah. What it is is I had too much to drink so I just knew I couldn't drive. It won't happen again. - That's good. - Do you have to do that? I just lost my job and... - Caffeine? - Thanks. Termination papers. - Somebody's in for a bad day. - You have no idea how bad. Door closer huh? - I'm separating from Ben. These are for Zoe Miller. Yeah. Now I've gotta tell Jack. - So wait, let me get this straight, Zoe and Ben? - Then there's me on a seesaw, total failure, total fool. - The hell you are. That's the most screwed up thing I ever heard of. She better pray the women in this plant don't get wind of this. They will rip her head off. - Glen. - No I mean it Alex. Look, any man that let's you walk is a total fool. I mean look at you, you're smart, caring, gorgeous. You're gonna get snatched up right away. - Oh. I'm sorry. - No it's okay, it's okay. - No I'm sorry. - Don't worry about it. - I feel like such a fool. - Look I meant every word I said Alex, as friends. - When you asked me about coworkers dating? - Oh yeah, it was someone in sales. It was a big mistake too I should've listened. - I'm such an idiot. I don't know how I could've read you so wrong. - It's a natural mistake. - I seem to make a lot of them. - Well, well, well, the little princess came crawling back. - It'd just be a couple of days Trey. - Maybe we could work something out. - I'm not comfortable with that. - Who asked you? - That's the thing, I'm a little short right now. - I'm always open to negotiation. Like hell. - What's it take for you to get this? Zoe is special to me, always was, always will be. If you don't like it you go in the hall. - Screw you. - Do you always have to be such a jerk to everyone? - Forget her. Let's talk about what's going on with you, us. - Just tell me what you want from me. - Well as a matter of fact I happen to be running a little short of cash myself and I know I can move some more of your merchandise. - I told you I'm done with that. - Not if you don't want to be. They took you back, they must trust you. - Did I just hear you say I was important to you? Don't ask me to do this. Please Trey. - Hey, hey, hey. You left me. Did I get a second chance? One mistake and bam you're out the door right? Right Zoe? - Right. - Right. So what goes around comes around. And don't look so upset. At least I'm giving you options. - What were you thinking Alex bringing that person into your home? - Mom please don't make this my fault. - Yeah, this is too soon for tough love honey? - Yes. - So are things really that bad in your marriage? - You kidding? It's over. - 16 years Alex. - Mom it's not like it just happened. It's obviously been coming for a while and I just didn't let myself see it. Maybe Zoe did me a favor. - Oh. How do you figure that? - Helping me to see how bad things had gotten. - Does Ben want to split up too? - No, so what? - Okay I know that what he did was beyond the pale Alex, but you could forgive him for your kids. - They'll be fine. I was fine when you and Dad broke up. - You weren't honey, you were a wreck. - Kids are different these days. Everybody's from a broken home. Kids are used to divorce, they'll be fine, we'll all be fine. Okay if you say so. - He brought up marriage counseling. I guess that should've been a red flag. He was probably just feeling guilty. I'm just so hurt you know? I just hurt so much, I just feel so hurt and I'm sad and I'm angry and I'm scared and I hate him. I hate him Mom. I hate him. - Hi I'm looking for Gwendolyn Miller. She's a patient there. Her daughter, I'm her daughter. She did? When? Did she leave an address for me? Well what about a phone number? Nothing? - Don't get too comfortable. - Thanks. - So what changed your mind princess? - Necessity. It's what people like us do right? Losers. We mess up our lives and screw over our friends. - Hey come on, come on, come here, come here, come here. Hey, you were not this messed up when we were together. You need me. - Hello. - Ben, it's Lauren. - How are you? - Still waiting for those chapters. - Yeah I'm working on it. - Work faster. - I'm doing the best I can Lauren. - Do you have anything for me at all? So tell me Ben when was it you lost your focus? - Probably around the time my marriage started falling apart. - I'm sorry to hear that, but you won't meet your deadline if you let it slow you down. Ben? - Yeah I'm here. - When I said you needed commitment I meant it. - Is this you giving me the kiss off? - No. No, you write the book, I will take you where you want to go but it sounds to me like you need to put your energy in other places right now. - Bye. - Good luck Ben. I mean it. - How's it going? - Oh, terrific. Turns out my productivity increases inversely to the chaos in my life. You? - Yeah, I'm staring out the window too. It means Alex I can't stop thinking about that kiss. I know you were in a bad place and I don't want to take advantage of that, but I just gotta know when you get past all this will I still have a shot? - Glen, you're still terrific but it's still a bad idea. - Guys. Hey Luke, Maddy. - What are you doing here? - Looking for you guys. - You found us. - Dad, why'd you go? - Want to grab something to eat and we can talk about it? - How about we don't? - Easy does it Maddy. - Go to hell Dad. - Hey watch your mouth young lady. - Don't even play father after what you did. - What did Mom tell you? - Do you think we're blind or stupid? - Sometimes things happen in a marriage, but that's between Mom and I and it's got nothing to do with how I feel about you guys. - Well it sucks to be you Dad because it changes everything for us. Come on Luke. - Grab some supper? Come on Luke give me a chance. You're old enough to understand some things now. - Luke? - You made Mom cry. How could you? Zoe was her friend Dad. I hate you. - Yeah I know. No, can you hang on a second? Mom? - Yeah? - It's Dad. - Okay, honey. Yeah I'm back. What did you say? - I want you to call before you come over. - You're reading my book. - Can we agree that you'll call before you come over? - I heard you. Alex this isn't good for the kids. - You should've thought of that before you cheated on me. I'm not gonna hear that for the rest of my life. - Ben the way I'm feeling right now I don't care if we ever talk again. - I asked you to to counseling with me Alex. - Well then what are you doing here you should be at freaking counseling. You're the one with the problem. I was happy, I'm fine. - Okay. I just need a few things. - Fine. - I promise I'll call next time. - Thank you. When you asked me to go to counseling was that before or after? - It was before. - Doesn't really change anything. - You asked me. - Is she with you? - No. We were so stupid. I needed to feel like I was wanted, like I, I'm so sorry. If I could undo this I would undo this. - Like a little boy, fix it for me, I broke it. Well I can't and I don't even want to. - The kids act like they hate me. - I can't help you. - Yeah. If you could just see it. You weren't hearing me. - Maybe not. Maybe not. This is wonderful, really. I should've read it before. I'll wait upstairs until you leave. - What do you think you're doing? Let's go. - Do you got any tranks? - Like they would last five minutes where Kayla could find it. Come on. Just a couple, I can get more after. Let's go. Feels like old times huh? Come on we were great together and you know it. - Just keep the engine running. - Sweet. I love this. I want you to take it easy today okay princess? Make yourself at home. I'll call you. - Have a crappy day. - Hello? - Ben. - Hello, Zoe? Zoe are you there? - Ben. - What do you want Zoe? - It's gonna be okay now. - What? - Did you tell Alex? - Tell her what? Tell her what? Zoe are you drunk? - I took some pills. - How many? Where are you? Do you need help? - It's gonna work. - What are you doing? - Being a cliche. - And my whole family crashes and burns. - It wasn't even mine. Oh wait are you ditching? Affirmative. - From the new security camera. - Has Jack seen this? No I thought you should first. - This can't wait. Excuse me do you mind? - Excuse you. Don't go. - Zoe, she's a real mess. I just talked to her on the phone. I don't know where she is. - So? Are you kidding me? You want me to help you find her? - Alex she's just a kid, she needs help. - I tried that. - She's in trouble alright? I think she said something about taking pills. - This is Alex, could you print out all the addresses we have for Zoe Miller? Thanks. Let's go. Zoe, Zoe? - There's no super. - Damn it. There. - Oh there. Oh my god, oh my god is she breathing? Zoe? Call 911. - Unresponsive adult female. Probable drug overdose. Are you the parents? - We're friends. - Heart stopped, blood pressure around 45. - Her heart stopped, is she gonna be okay? - Alex, Alex. - Don't. - So we've got all day. Where do you want to go? The movies, the mall, the bookstore? - Hoops. - You've gotta be kidding me? - Hey you said wherever I wanted. - Yeah I guess so. - She has a mother in rehab. She wanted to find her own place so that they could live together. Oh god, this should never have happened. - None of it should've. It's always just been you. - So it was just sex? - She made me feel so wanted. - She needed someone to look up to. - I realize now that was just about you. How she felt about you. - I love you. Probably always will. - If I thought there was a way we could get by this. - I didn't say that. This poor girl got caught in the middle of us and I'll never forgive myself if-- - I know. - Don't. - If I lose you I lose everything. I know I have no right to ask for forgiveness, but I love you. I love the kids, I love our family, what we have and I will do anything to make this work if you could just listen to me. - We can't talk about this while she's-- - Yeah. - She's gonna be alright isn't she? She's not gonna die or anything? - No she's not gonna die. - So does this mean you guys are getting back together? - It means we're gonna try. - Shoot some hoops? - Yeah. - Feel a little bit okay? - Yeah a little. And a little like a truck hit me. - Well you just concentrate on getting better. There's not going to be any repercussions or anything if you know what I mean? Oh don't. - Too late. - Listen we're gonna do everything we can to get you back on track okay? You're not alone. - That's not why I'm upset. It's... This is exactly where we started with you helping me. Alex, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. - The company's gonna be owing you a lot of money. Your bags are selling well. Once we can straighten things out with Jack which I'm sure we can. Your bags are getting a lot of attention. - Really? - Yeah. Promise me you're never going to do anything like this again. Get some rest. - Alex. - Yeah? You and Ben? - We've got a lot invested in each other. We'll be alright. I guess you'd better get some rest. Oh man. Wow. Here. - It's beautiful Ben. - Yeah they did a great job didn't they? - Yeah. I didn't know you did a dedication. - Yeah I wanted to surprise you. - To my wife and partner Alex who I'd marry all over again and to all the happy marriages everywhere. Oh Ben. Come here.
