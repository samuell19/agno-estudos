A nightingale over a rose has poured the ney over it. I don t know what is happening to me, my heart is aching. I don t know what is happening to me, my heart is aching. The rose remembers the sadness and is covered by the morning dew. The nightingale is excited and don't know what is happening to me? d don' t kno w what is happening to me, what is happening to me, what is happening to me? I don t know what is happening to me. Asker, my dear, you sing so sadly that my heart is aching. What kind of life do I have, eh, aunty Jahan. If life comes and goes what will be the end of it? Thanks God, am healthy, young and rich but my soul desires something more. Oh, my dear, I really don t understand you for God's sake! Oh, aunty, aunty, am not talking clearly? You see I have everything but still I feel that 'm missing something. Well, if you are missing something, let s sent him to the market to do some shopping. It's not a problem. Yet again, you don t understand me. Day by day go by and my life will go by and then what? Oh, Asker, I don t understand arabic. Just tell me what's going on. What is it that you want? I know what master wants! What? What does the nightingale want from the rose in the spring? That's right! You've gone crazy! No, aunty, Vali is not crazy. I want to get married ! Get married! dw hat did say? Asker, my dearest! At last you've leveled with me. Your passed away father before he died told me: Jahan, my sister, perhaps God doesn t want me to see Asker married, please promise me that you will marry him. Oh, dear, it s not a place to cry. I want to get married, but how should do it? But am dead? I am so happy today as the long awaited hour has arrived. Shame, my brother isn't here to hear this he is no longer with us. Let me wear my head cover and underline my eyebrows for you, my dearest nephew. I'll find a bride just like that! All women are so cunning but you won't fool the widow. We will celebrate the wedding greatly and my choice will be the best one. No, no, aunty, I don t want it this way. This way, I will never get married. Till see the bride with my own eyes and fall in love with her I won't get married. Oh! Who will show you the bride before the wedding? What girl will agree to show her face before the stranger? My garden is hidden under the fog, The stars are shining high in the sky and young yellow crescent is seen through the key hole. The wind whispers tales, making me cry. I'm so sad, it's so strange. Who will tell me why? I can count all my tears All the tears cry My song is flying far away beyond the city line. But no one hears me, only wind can be a friend of mine. The wind is sleeping on the trees I hear its sniff and feel its breeze. My garden is in slumber's arms, so who can tell me why I feel so strange, I feel trouble... And every day I cry... and every day cry... The sadness is limitless like the sea, my soul is saddened and is drowning in tears. The whole world sees my sorrow, the whole world is aching with me. For those breaths that sound with tears over the whole house. Let the sky kill me with the terrifying thunder! Oh, come! My darling! Oh, come, my darling, my darling, come! Gulchohra, stop singing. You are getting everyone depressed! Our whole lifee is a depression. Ladies, believe me, you will not be sad for long. Very soon bey will marry you off and then your depression will just disappear. Oh, Telli, Telli, no matter how much you say khalva, khalva, it will not sweeten your mouth. Just wait, ladies, wait. It will all be ok. It would be better if we won't be given away God forsake! You don t even know what he looks like, old, leans on one leg, blind or bold... Don t be silly. If you think this way then you will dry out within the four walls. I will marry the one who my uncle will find for me. I will not marry till I fall in love. Oh, ladies, I swear to God getting married to the unknown man is way better and more exciting. Just think how you get dressed, pampered and put on a phaeton and all shout "Be Happy!" A sheep in being sacrificed by your feet, then you are taken to your fiancee's room, are put under the vale and are waiting and your heart beats like a drum, foot steps appear and the door opens.. and a young, tall and sophisticated man enters. Oh, God forsake from this kind of groom. Telli, why my bed is not made?! Your master comes home tired, sick and it is all a mess everywhere oh, oh, oh !

Wife will color the mustache with henna before bedtime, will wash up in the morning and in the night time... You're right, the doctors advise the same thing but a big wedding doesn't suit me with music and shoot outs. I am too old and don't have that much money. No, no. Make it less glamorous. Take a widow, mature, juicy, buxom and the spending won't be big. Three manats, one sugar head, one mullah and the end of story! Golden words, meshedi... three manats, sugar head, one mullah and the end of story! What else does bey desire? Best rahat lukum, raisins, greens, nuts? Real nuts. Thanks, meshedi.

I would like that Sultan bey has 12 daughters. But why? Then one of them he would give to the bey, the other to the khan, the third to the trader and the last one to me... No. He won't give her to me. I am a poor peddler and he is a bey. So you are not married? Of course, not. I have walked so many roads, but still couldn't find you. You have appeared in front of me and now have lost myself. I will watch your gently lips and the beauty of your eyebrows. I am losing my mind from love, please spear me, miss.

Oh, Suleyman master! What a nightmare! It was so horrifying! He got rid of everyone! Shouted like a camel ! Almost hung me on a tree! Talk clearly! Who did this? It's him, him, Sultan bey! Sultan bey? Yes, yes! Askers' fiancée is his daughter. Her name is Gulchohra. Oh, you have no idea how angry he is! He hit me with this shoe so hard... It is all nothing, my heart is aching. Poor, poor Asker master. So you got into the house of my close friend Sultan bey. It's ok, it s ok. He didn't give his daughter to Asker arshin the peddler, he will to Asker the merchant.

He is clever, smart, rich and is my best friend. So, what do you say? Son, but my daughter is still a child. But you have more than one daughter I don't think she is a child. But first of all I want to see him, get to know him. You know best... Sure, if I haven't earned bey s trust... Oh, no, come on, Suleyman ! Your choice is good enough for me. I will be honest.
