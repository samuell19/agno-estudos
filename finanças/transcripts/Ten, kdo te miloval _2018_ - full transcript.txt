Detective Kalina, hello. Sure you can't squeeze me in somewhere? Tomorrow at nine? I'm at the DA's office. You think I'll stop the investigation over changing freaking tires? Last minute? I've been trying to get in for three weeks. But you'd have to work past two p.m., right? What? The day after tomorrow after lunch. Great. Thank you so very much, I owe you a box of chocolates. Thank you, I know it will. Goodbye. Witch... -When is it gonna be over? -Soon. That's all I have, I'm sorry. I hope I won't have to give birth in this place too. Things will get moving tomorrow, you'll see. That's him! They know about us. I know you're at home! You've flooded me out again. I'm sorry. I'll call the plumber tomorrow. Bastards! -Lights out! -What's up, Irina? They're Pecold's men. -Where is your cell phone? -In the safe. Hurry! They can't see us together. You should wear a wig. Come on, Irina, hurry! Watch out. The backyard takes you one street down. -Jeez. Do something about it. -I can't, I get them often now. Okay? I'm sorry. Irina, run! Josef! -Give me your hand! -No! -Your hand! -I'm okay. Run. I'll kill you. -Honey. -Where are you? I know, I should've called. Boys, stop it. -Shall we hold dinner for you? -No, don't. -I still have work to do. -Right. -Buy fresh rolls for breakfast. -Rolls it is. I'll get the rolls. Bye bye. Kiss. Bondik, come. Let's go. THE ONE WHO LOVED YOU -It's hard as a rock. -So dunk it in the milk. Hurry up, Kuba, before the chickens hatch out of those eggs. -I want to see that! -Where is Dan? -Dan, where are you? -Here! Taking a poop. He ain't pooping. He's playing games. -Go! -Wait! I had ten diamonds to finish the level. Finish your breakfast. Look, I'll put this on the teacher's desk. Cool... -What do you have there? -Nothing! -Mom, when is he coming today? -No idea. -He said he'd take them to school. -No Dad, St. Nick. I think St. Nick ain't coming to our house. Maybe a devil. -Come on, finish it. -I don't want to. Finish it or a Somali Nick will come to our house. -What is a sommelier Nick? -In Somalia, that's in Africa, when St. Nick visits the children, his first question is: Kids, why are you so skinny? And the kids say: 'cause we don't eat. And St. Nick frowns and says: If you don't eat, you don't get any presents! Finally! I'll kill him. Rolls too. Mrs. Kalinová, can I talk to you? Sure. Your husband was a victim in a car accident. Nearer, my God, to Thee, nearer to Thee! E'en though it be a cross that raiseth me; Still all my song shall be nearer, my God, to Thee. Nearer, my God, to Thee, nearer to Thee! Málková, you're an octave higher. Zdobinská, no jumping ahead, this is not a competition. -Do we know anything? -Yup. Forensics confirmed what we anticipated. The tires on Kalina's car were bald, so he went into a skid. -The winter came out of the blue. -Out of the blue? It's the mountains. Damn! Watch out! -Idiots! -Help them, Fidlerová. Jacket! Let go! -Leave that jacket there. -Everything's fine. Make some room, please. Vanda, you must be strong. My condolences, Mrs. Kalinová. Dear family and friends. Detective Josef Kalina was a loving husband, great father and my good friend. It brings out a deep pain inside us, a great sorrow shakes our innards. DA Zvoníček's a real jerk. -He's gonna cry. -Stop it! Yes, they say never say die. Detective Josef Kalina dedicated his life to combating economic crime. -A brave policeman left us... -Are you crazy, Irina? What are you doing here? What if someone recognizes you? We're saying goodbye to a brave friend, who lost his life in the line of duty. In the line of duty? It was a regular accident, yes? But it sounds better in the eulogy. -Who is that woman? -Dunno. Nearer, my God, to Thee, nearer to Thee! E'en though it be a cross that raiseth me... Irina! Still all my song shall be nearer, my God, to Thee... No, Marcela. Cancel that meeting. -I'll call later. -Just go ahead, Zvoníček. Pain shoots up into my heart, Doctor. -Could be a sign of flatus defixus. -Also known as trapped gas. Let's collect Kalina's stuff and slip away. Do you ever switch off, Heřman? -Come on, finish that sandwich. -I've had three already. We have plenty of sandwiches. Enjoy. Our patients supply us with food like it was a matter of life and death. Have another one... Vanda, I'm sorry. Vanda... Doctor, could you look at my daughter? -Sure. What's wrong with her? -I think she has asthma. -Tell her to stop by my office. -Yay, you're the best. How come it's impossible? Cancel that meeting. Where are the boys? They've been awfully quiet. -What do you think is inside? -Some super secret stuff. -Christmas presents? -Right! I know there's no Kris Kringle and Dad turned on the Christmas lights. That means there won't be Christmas this year. Don't cry. Let's try our names. Window! I got it! Dad's secret notes! Punch in: 5, 8, 5, 3. -Look, a cell phone. -And a spy paw. -Don't touch that phone. -It's dead. Boys, you're asking for trouble. -Irina? Who is she? -You're asking for it. Anyone seen Vanda? Vanda? Oh, here you are. Watch out! I'm here if you need anything. Thank you. -How will I manage without Josef? -Take your paws off her. I have to see to the guests. Did he really touch our Mom? Yup. On her hand. Yuck. Shit. The space racer... Here, have one. Two at night. But careful, they're addictive. Mrs. Kalinová, I know it's not the right time now, -but we need Josef's things. -Why? It's the materials for the cases he worked on. You really don't waste time, Heřman. Maybe you should've questioned Mrs. Kalinová right at the funeral. I'll honor you with a visit in the next few days. You're probably worried what might come up about you. I talked to Josef the day before he died. He had new evidence in Pecold's case. Mrs. Kalinová, thank you for inviting us. Once again, my condolences. -Mom, someone broke our race car. -You should put away your toys. -Dad gave it to us. -Your mother is right. Here, I have a band-aid, maybe we can still fix it. The wheels go like this... We'll fix it. We'll heal your car. I'll fasten it... Move your thumb... Well, it's okay. I have to go back to my office now. Doc, all your appointments are canceled for today. Sit. This is an emergency. Thank you. I wanted to be a hockey player, but it didn't really work out. -You can borrow my skates, okay? -Careful. I'm fine. -Did I hurt you? -No, I'm okay. -I'm sorry. -It's cool. So, how are you, Irina? -You can see, no? I'm knocked up. -Yup, I can see that. Irina, what happened? I've been looking for you, called... I know. I'm sorry, Santa. I had to leave town for a while. But it's been several months. You simply vanished into thin air. No goodbye. You know how I felt? I'd like to explain it to you. No need, okay? Let's go for a walk. Okay. You can move in with me. Now that Josef is dead, someone must take care of you two. Mom, you think Dad had some new evidence and that's why died? Oh come on, what makes you think that? Dad had a car accident. That's right. Mom, can we have a dog like Dad had when he was a kid? -And who's gonna take care of it? -We will. -Dad said he would get us one. -I never said that. -For Christmas maybe. -But Kris Kringle brings gifts, yes? Mom, every kid knows that Kris Kringle is Dad. Or Mom. Now go to sleep, you chatterboxes. G'night. I'll pick up the boys at school tomorrow and we'll go ice skating. You're nice but I'll take care of them. They need me now more than ever. Do you know someone named Irina? What is it? It's that woman from the funeral. Maybe she's an agent. Josef worked undercover. I'm not stupid. Some time ago Josef asked me to hire some pregnant woman. So she could get social security. I mean she doesn't have a red wig but it's her. Look, for good luck. Looks almost like you. Angel, dove. -Put it on the church organ. -The organ? -Yup. When you disappeared, I almost quit. Why? Every time I put my hands on the keyboard, I saw you there. At Kalina's funeral I played again after a long time. But back then... I might be wrong but I felt that we started something. Maybe we did. You should tell it to Vanda. She's a reasonable woman. You bastard! How could you? I know it looks weird but it's not like that. I'm sure you'd tell me it's not like that. I heard somewhere that home is where the flowers are. Hello. Can I get these flowers? -Would you like something white? -Those white sticks would be nice. And maybe the green too. Will that be enough? When you and the baby move in with me... Thank you. ...you'll live in clover. -What's up, dude? -Irina? Irina? Irina! -He's still there. -Oh yeah. Boys, stop staring out of the window. Finish breakfast and get dressed. -I can do that. -I can still butter the bread. I'm sorry. I just can't get over it. It's hard for all of us. -Mom, do you like the name Irina? -What makes you say that? If I were a girl I'd be named Irina. -Who told you that? -Dad. -She won't buy that, young man. -Nonsense. It's an ugly name. -What are you doing with that? -Taking it to the office. -Why? -That's why. The boys are a little too curious. Make way for Grandma. Be good in school. See you tonight. Boys, get in the car! Give it to me. Give it to me and get in the car. -90 over 60, Jiřina. -Okay. Do you drink red wine? Jeez, no way, Doctor. I don't drink at all. Very rarely, with my girlfriends, but it's only occasionally. So start drinking. Even without your girlfriends. Two glasses a day and regularly. You have mild hypotension. -Hypo what? -Hypotension. -Wait, seriously? -Seriously. Did you forget something? Should I take the magenta pills or the white pills? Blue and yellow, Mr. Konopík. You don't have any magenta or white. -I can't tell, I have cataracts. -No problem, I'll mark it for you. Doctor, what about my Jitka? From an anthropological perspective she's an enticing object to observe. But apart from low blood pressure she is damn well. Mrs. Bečvářová, wait outside, if you don't mind. Thank you. -So... M and E. -M like magenta? No, M like morning, E like evening. Don't worry about the colors. I'm sorry, Doctor, that my Mom made me come here like this. You probably don't have time to turn around before Christmas. Listen, I can give you something for that pressure. But the pills have side effects, you'll be here every other day. -I wouldn't mind that. -Okay. What about your asthma? -What asthma? -Your Mom said you have asthma. I don't have asthma, but I often have a sharp pain here. -And a burning pain in my chest. -It will be hereditary. Let me get my stethoscope... Damn thing, what is...? -Where did you get it? -From Josef's safe. That woman came to his funeral and she's pregnant. I think it's his. You knew her too. You treated her, isn't that right? -Should I take off my panties too? -Of course. Of course not! You said anything that Zvoníček touches, rots away. -Yup. Stinky booger. -Mom's hand will fall off. We must do something so she hates him as much as we do. -How do you wanna do that? -Leave it to me. -Shall we tape him? -Just keep mum about it. Cops are real pros, after three years of flagrant siphoning of the funds they decided to charge Pecold... -Pecold! Dad worked on that. -How do you know? -We know stuff! -We know stuff, Mom. -Bye, Mom. -Bye. -Boys? No kiss? -Mom... -We never had to kiss Dad. But we'd love to kiss you. Careful, boys, so you don't slip. Stop playing around, it's gonna ring. Go inside. Everyone. Domestic animals are bred for social purposes or for protection, such as dogs, which we keep at home, right? -Ouch, you stupid? -Bulínová! -What is it? -Give it to me, it's dangerous. A paw? Pink, that's girly. It's super secret spyware, like James Bond had. -What does it do? -It explodes. -You're full of it. -I am not. Take it back. -Hell no. -Show me. -Give it to me. It's mine. What do you have there, Kalina? -Well, Sýkorová? -Miss, Kalina has a bomb. Really? Give it to me. I see. I guess Kalina is a young terrorist. Hello, boss. I need the list of employees hired within the last year. Got it. Okay, that's it. I was expecting you. How long have you been seeing my husband? More than a year. When did you last see him? -The night he died. -Did you sleep together that night? -He needed to give me something. -Probably child support. -Leave me alone. -Hold on. I want to know what happened. Is this child his? Did you want to leave together? I found your passport. -You didn't 'cause he killed himself! -He didn't kill himself. He was killed. He had a police apartment at his disposal. And that's where you met? You have no idea about lots of things. We had to run away that night. I can't go back there. I left most of my stuff there. If you bring it to me, I'll tell you what happened. -What's up? -We're screwed. -Hamplová took the bug. -Shoot. -Got the headphones at least? -I do. Great, we'll find out where that paw is. -They said it was a bomb. -A bomb, oh please. If we were in America you'd have the entire school evacuated. -And in America, no smoking in here. -Of course. I know, Jolana, this is bad. They are animals. That's right, dumb animals, and that's what we talked about today. You did? Can I be your dog? -This is good. What is it? -It's coming from that paw. Azor, take me. What's this gathering here? Give it to me. -Are you my bitch? Say it! -I'm your bitch. Go to your classroom. Now. There's nothing to hear here. Go, go! -What's your next week's lesson? -Pigs. -Wait. You shouldn't have come here. Mrs. Kalinová... -Damn woman! -What are you doing? Give it here. -You gotta wash it off, chief. -I'm sorry. I thought you were... The owner of the apartment you broke into? Damn, it burns. They should ban this stuff. Can you tell me what you're doing here? Nothing. Fidlerová, see if there's any evidence in the hallway. -I've already looked. -Fidlerová... Don't look for some mystery in it. That woman was Josef's informant. He was hiding her in this house. It's standard police procedure. Of course. Standard procedure. I know he was cheating, so you can cut this crap. It's easy to accuse someone who can't fight back. We must protect your husband's reputation. If only for the kids. No way. I want to know what happened. -And why Josef had to die. -He died in a car accident. You believe that? How do you know nobody else was at the accident. Maybe they pushed him off the road! Zvoníček said... Your family friend Zvoníček! Stop playing detective. It could be dangerous. Not just for you. -Sure you don't want to see a doctor? -I'm fine. You still owe me the contents of your husband's safe. -But I don't have anything. -Don't give me that. My mother-in-law took everything to work. Found something, chief. You had a hunch. You see? Not really. -Shots were fired here. -I see, "just an accident". It was probably Josef's second phone, for his affairs. You're imagining things. It's just a work phone. I doubt it. He'd have had it on him. They found it after the accident. Neither Heřman nor Vanda can get their hands on it. -It's locked anyway. -And that's how it will stay. I wanted to talk to you about that woman in the wig. I must write it in large letters, because some patients are obviously going blind. -Greetings. -Heřman, what happened to you? -What? -You are all... -Oh, this. A crazy widow sprayed my eyes with pepper spray. Don't worry, we'll put drops in it, and you'll see like an eagle again. I saw your daughter-in-law and she assured me that I could get Josef's things from you. -What things? -Stop it, the things from his safe. -Are you okay? -It's nothing, dropped the evidence. Oh, what am I saying, you're a man of eminence. There were just a few useless things there, sure you want it? A few useless things? Right, safes are for storing useless things. Heřman, Vanda lost her husband, boys lost their father and I lost my son. Don't pry into it, please. I don't tell you whether to give someone his shot. -Heřman, ask for the cell phone. -The cell phone? Cell phone? What phone? I don't have any cell phone. Doc, could that pepper spray have any side effects? -Maybe mild nausea. -More like hallucinations. There will be hallucinations when Vanda learns Josef was cheating. -Is that all? -Yes. I have this itch in my right leg. -You know what it is? -No. -It could be the start of gout. -It's not gout. It happens to me every time someone's lying in my face. -The rest of the stuff, please. -Of course. Here. Finally. Kalina's computer will be copied on that disk. We'll start with that. -Hope we get it done before Christmas. -Why Christmas? It's tradition, starting the new year with a clean slate. Chief, I found something interesting. Kalina had a bugged phone registered to him. -So what? -It's starting to move. -Heřman, ask for the cell phone. -The cell phone... -Maybe it wasn't a car accident. -It was, by all means. So why didn't he have that phone on him? And why is it moving now? Why? Why is the sky blue, why is the water running? Why do women ask so many questions? Why? Damn Kalina... Strix, Hoopoe, get on your way. -Chief, I think that maybe... -Something wrong, Hoopoe? No, it... everything's fine. Let's crack 'em down! Tdd...something, something...Xmas. Whose idea was this? Tdd...something, something...Xmas. The Ministry of Interior called, asking what we want it to say. So I told Fidlerová that anything, like tdd...something, something... Xmas. And they put it there. We're hidden like apples on an oak. -Hello. -Good evening. What can I do for you? Are those Rocky Belly Capouns for sale? I say next year we assemble in front of the church and give away the potato salad to those in need. Stop it, you can't unlock the phone. I can't, but the cops could. Then they'd have proof Josef was intimate with that woman. You know what it would mean? Vanda could lose his pension. And there's a baby too. Nobody can find out about it. You hear me? So give it to me and I'll hold onto it so you can relax. -Thank you. You're nice. -Or stupid. They could accuse us of withholding evidence. -That's true. -Go. -Just tell me where to go. -Uphill. It's coming from the church. Maybe Kalina's ghost is there. Right. The path was stomped thus. The path was stomped thus. Who stomped it, who stomped it? Mother of Jesus. Who stomped it, who stomped it? Mother of Jesus. Dude, if it goes on any longer, I'll be stone-deaf. I wonder who thinks up these stupid costumes. It came from the Interior. We have a summer version too. A canoeing team. We'll have a canoe on the roof. -And a pumpkin's in the fall, yes? -How do you know? -I guessed. -I see. Just tell me, Strix, what's our handle? Eagle One, Eagle One. -Eagle One, Eagle One. -What's your situation, Hoopoe? Sucks, chief. We localized the phone in the church near chicks in menopause singing off-key. That's all you've got? No one else is there? Doctor Dove is playing the piano. Why would Kalina tail Dove? He's a family friend. Doesn't make sense, Hoopoe. No one else is there? -Just that redhead from the funeral. -Jeez. -Why didn't you say so before? -Tell him he didn't ask. You didn't ask, chief. Oh, and ask him if we should take action. Should we take action, chief? By no means. Stay on it. The redhead, that would make sense. Kalina had her bugged. Irina... Ladies, don't forget that we have a dress rehearsal on the 20th. Hi. You're not leaving yet, Doc? I have those tripe sausages for you. It's nice of you, Mrs. Bečvářová. but I'm fine without them today. You surprised me. I usually seek you out. Did you go to see Vanda? -I didn't have to. She came to me. -And will she help you? -I think she doesn't believe me. -What matters is that I believe you. -Santa? -Yes? Does your housing offer still stand? Of course it does. Sure. -I recommend flambé oysters. -Let me see the menu. -Good evening, boss. -Good evening. Hi. Let me... Maybe we should've gone somewhere else. Do you want a drink? It'll relax you. -For whom was Josef a problem? -For me, for example. -We'll have the flambé oysters. -Yes. Okay. According to the report it was an accident. The reason is more banal than you can imagine. No death squad, no pushing off the road. Just bald summer tires on an icy road. There's nothing you can do about it now. Josef is gone, for good. I'll be honest with you. Josef really knew a lot. He just didn't have any credible witnesses. He was searching for truth even -if it put everyone in danger. -Screw you, Zvoníček. Here. Don't worry about Heřman, I'll take care of him. I have a weird feeling about him. I don't trust him. Jesus Christ! -Ouch! What's that? -I apologize. I warned you, Zvoníček. -Did you see it? -I did. You were on fire. So put it out, okay? DAN, DAD, KUBA You're late. The boys were waiting for you. -Why did you take Josef's stuff away? -What stuff? Stop it. You know what I mean. What are you hiding from me? What would I hide from you? I gave it to Heřman. -Everything? -What I thought appropriate. -Why make a mess in life? -It's already a mess. -She's right, Mom. -You're right, but so am I. What did you hide from me? Irina... Don't tailgate him. You think it's possible? Can't go any slower than this. They should take that man's license. -Villa Gertruda welcomes you. -Gertruda? -Who gave it such a stupid name? -It was my Grandmother's name. Yay, you have a dog? It showed up here a couple days ago and now waits for me here every day. Make yourself at home. Santa, I have something for you. I see. But it's not Christmas yet. Well, I wanted to give it to you now. Because I am due on the 24th. That's why. -Here... -Thank you. Rocky Belly Capouns! You remember? -Yup. -Wow... -Well... Will you play it? -Okay. -I'll put it aside, okay? -Okay. How do you like it here? It's pretty... cozy. I need to clean it up before Christmas. Playing this crap should be banned. Just like under the Commies. What? It's just rock music. Better than singing whales. -You mean those in the church? -No, the ones Milada listens to. She's calling. Eagle One! What eagle? -Joking again? -I'm not joking, Honey. -So cut it out. Where are you? -We're surveilling, you know? I don't care about your surveillance. You should be here. Don't be mad. Just don't call Cassandra, okay? -I am gonna call her. -Please, don't call Cassandra. -Milada... -Bye! -Who is Cassandra? -Some crazy witch who pressures Milada to give birth at home in a tub. -While listening to whales. -Why for God's sake? Because giving birth is a very natural and intimate thing. So if someone stares at her while she gives birth, it's the same as someone watching her take a poop. -Want some? -No, thanks. I'm fine. -Come sit down. -Okay. What are you doing? Get up. Jeez. Wait, I'll put it away for you. Dude, that man's gotta have a jammer there. They are so clever, eh? Santa... It's me. Yes. I... You know how I told you that... that I only had one serious relationship, well... I was being serious. Remember? Back then Kalina brought to my office a girl with a fever... -And a cough. -And I cured her. And then took her to church. -It was my best concert ever. -And the drunkest. Go, Santa, go! Don't. -I must get it. -Fine. Wait for me. Doc, we're sorry to bother you this late but my daughter helped me. I couldn't carry it alone. I told you it wasn't necessary. Let me take it... No, no, we've got it. Jitka, let's go. Hello. Jarda finally killed that pig. I was cleaning the blood off tiles until midnight. -Put it in the fridge. -Okay. -What's up? You look down. -It's the allergy. You have a nice place, romantic, those candles and stuff... Kalina's phone? You like reproductions too? I have the sunflowers at home. This is an original. Ladies, I have to tend to my duties. -So if you don't mind... -I wanted to thank you for Jitka. -With her you'd live in clover. -Right. She's had a bad experience, so she'd move mountains for you. Yes. -You have a visitor? -A patient... female. Tough case. This way, ladies, thank you. -Well, we won't keep you then. -Good. And we want the boxes back. -Give the boxes back. -Of course. Thank you. Goodbye. -Please don't cry. -I'm so stupid. The feast is over. Don't cry, there will be another one. I was worried I wouldn't find you here. Don't worry, Santa, I won't run away again. -Just tomorrow, one last time. -I won't let you go anywhere. Kalina is dead, I have to solve it alone. No way. I'll take a day off from the office. Where should I go? To a wedding. Mr. Pecold, I painted it myself. Here's to the bride. Get me the best stuff. I want to do it all night long. -Closed. -Hello, I'm Dr. Dove. Hello, I'm Dr. Dove. I'm a friend of Irina Lisická. I need to talk to Mr. Pecold. No! We'll be at my compound later. Tell her to come alone and bring me what I want. Boys! The world is full of paradoxes, like that lobbyist Pecold. I heard the entire court security are his groomsmen. -It was that Pecold guy. -Why did you turn it off? That's why! -Mom, will you give us a kiss? -That's the way to do it, boys. -You are not ashamed of me anymore? -No. But I doubt you'll smooth out that mess with Azor the dog. Mrs. Kalinová, do you have a minute? That thing belonged to my husband. I thought it was lost somewhere. Kuba put it in the teacher's pocket during class. -That's bullshit. -There's a bug in that pendant. -Kuba listened in on his teacher. -How did you find out? I'd prefer not to go into details. It was nothing pleasant. There are places where a man can lose his dignity. -You think it's funny? -I'm sorry. I'll hand it over to Detective Heřman and we could all forget about it, okay? I'm sorry, but unauthorized wiretapping in school that's serious misbehavior. I feel like killing you, boys. I'll stop by at Zvoníček's. So do not turn the place upside down. -You hear me? -Yes, Mom. -You got ants in your pants? -What makes you say that? Grandma says that women have long nails -to scrape ants out of their butts. -Don't be rude, you brat! Hello, Marcelka. I came to test the defectors. -I mean detectors. -You're silly. Boys, make room for the maintenance man. This is useless. Doesn't even record. Your little rascals didn't break any school policy. I'm sorry to bother you, but you're the only one whom I can confide in. I'll call that nutty principal. -I'll deal with him. -You're nice. The boys were cuffed so I hope they'll stop now. -What's that thing you got? -You curious little inspector. This special pole can tell me if these fire defectors are working. And can you turn it on with it too? If I want... I can do anything. You should get some rest now. Why don't you send the boys to the mountains for the holidays? And we could go somewhere, the Seychelles maybe? A week by the sea will be good for you. Maybe you're right. What is it? The boys! -Boys! -Raining! -Shoot! -The fire defectors went off. -The boys did it! -Can you do something about it? -Turn off the fire defectors. Hello! -Let me see! -Turn off the water. -Stop it! -You hear me? Turn it off! What a dolt, eh? -I leave you alone for five minutes. -It's not our fault. It wasn't us. Kalinová, hello. What? Jeez, I'll be right there. -Excuse me. -What do you want? -To talk to Mr. Zvoníček. -Mr. DA is busy now. Greetings. I know it looks odd, but it's not what it looks like. You're not making short work of it. Heřman, out! Of course. I can wait outside until you get dressed. Lock the door, so no one can come in. I don't need help, really. -You don't look good. -I don't need any help... -God, what happened, Santa? -Jeez, you know him? Yes, he's a family friend. Are you hurt? -What acquaintances she's got. -Stop it. -I have probably broken a rib. -What about your nose? -What about it? -It needs stitches. Tell your mother-in-law to come to work. And you take me there. -Come here. -Okay. Why are you getting into fights with the Russians? At your age. -You think I'm too old? -Shhh! See what that slut does, you should get rid of her. -You forgot there are children here. -Those scamps? -Nothing is sacred to them. -What did you do, boys? -Tell her! -Nothing... What about that prank with the taps? And that fire detector? We didn't put it in her pocket. She took it from us! You listened in on the teacher in the restroom. It was in the principal's office with him there. -She called him a dog's name. Azor. -You're making it up. Boys, go next door. We'll do surgery here. -Go. -Oh well. Pants down. You don't know Irina. She is... A tart who's expecting a child with my dead husband. -Why is that woman panting so hard? -She's panting? -Yup. Shoot, Strix! A life is at stake. We must take action! -Heřman will give us hell. -Screw Heřman. We're here. Let's breathe. Keep a regular rhythm, short, short, long. Strix! I haven't okayed anything like this! -This is a matter of life! -What life? What are you playing out there? You must breathe. Short, short, long. One, one, two... Strix, what's the situation? One, one, two... Head! I can see the head. -We can see the head. -The head! Over and out! This is just so amateurish. It'll be fine, chief. Hoopoe took a homebirth course. Gone are the days when cops were chasing thieves and women gave birth while working in the fields. -Drive steadily, not like a psycho. -I'm a cop, not a medic. -My purse. Where is my purse? -Jeez, things you think of now. Jeez, your worries. Here is your purse. Stop! Stop! Can't deliver it like this. And now instead of yelling, try pushing, Irina. I guess it's yours. -Irina Lisická? -Are you the father? -No, the doctor. -Number eleven, but... And you? -The stepmother. Wait a minute, you can't... -What are you doing here? -We are with the police. -God, what happened to you? -I'll explain it to you later. -Is everything fine? You okay? -Just like after giving birth. -Oh, Doctor, thank you. -I'm not a doctor. -Are you the father? -No. Look, this isn't some kind of a cuckoo's nest. -Who are you? -I'm Dr. Dove. -And you? -I'm Hoopoe. I don't care. Which one of you is the father? -The father is my dead husband. -I'm definitely not. -He's definitely not. -Thank you. -He is not? I've never slept with Kalina. He wasn't my type. I haven't slept with anyone. Except for Dove here. He's the father. You can run a test. Okay. Who isn't a father or doctor or family, leaves now. Of course. Congratulations, Doc. -The uniforms are so misleading. -Go now. Why didn't you tell me? I didn't want you to be another person whose life I'd ruin. I'm sorry. So mystery of the child is solved. And now I'd like to know who's behind my husband's death. Vanda! -Did they do this to you? -Yup. -Assholes. -We must inform Heřman. -No. I don't trust cops. What if they're bribed? What about Pecold? Will they meet with me? Forget it, they're dangerous people. Can you tell me what's going on here? Preferably from the beginning. I know what it looks like, Fidlerová. But the end justifies the means. My ex-husband wasn't some mobster, he was just a regular accountant. Unfortunately Pecold made him do some tax scam. As a reward he was promised a new Mercedes. And when it came out, he took the blame and went down for it. And I knew all the details regarding Pecold's ploys. Where are those materials now? A phone in that purse has a recording which can send them behind bars. -Or destroy us. I would just drop it. -Listen to him, he's right. It's broken. -You sure that phone is broken? -It is, but it still has a signal. Let's go then. We don't need to be everywhere. Let's go. Hello... -What's on it? -What was on it. Pecold's secret meeting. How many times did those people see you? Vanda, what are you doing? Leave it alone, this is dangerous. I must follow through with it. For the boys' sake. Yes, for the boys' sake. It's enough they lost their father. They lost the best father in the world. Vanda! -I'll finish it for you. -Vanda, don't be crazy. You think it's enough if you put on a wig, think it will fool them? DON'T BE A FOOL -I feel like you're still here. -I am, but it can't do shit. Stop, Sergey. I said stop. This is not that woman. I'm happy. Pecold, come out, you coward. Looks like it's your lucky day. So where is it, you little dove? How did you kill my husband? You might be surprised but your husband made it easy for us. -He killed himself. -Went into a skid during the chase. In the woods. Just when we were about to put a bomb under his car. Luckily Sergey is kind of an amateur. Just like you in your disguise, Mrs. Kalinová. Your turn now. The recording. You kidding? It's broken. -That's all I've got. -Frisk her. Calm down. What's this? -It will get worse, Mrs. Kalinová. -It belongs to my kids. They used it to listen in on... Put her in the car. Now! Sergey, help him. Hurry. -I'll blow her away. -No, not here. -Give it to me! -I'll break the glass. You nuts? You know how much it cost? -I don't care. -I'll kill you. Pull her out. Now. Let's get out of here. Cops. That bitch... Everything's fine, don't shoot. Your hands. I've been looking forward to this for at least five years. We'll take it from here, boss. Let's go. Let's take you home. Poor dog, he's all wet. -Shall we take him home? -You crazy? Mom would kill us. Besides, we're in a jam already. -I don't care. -You nuts or what? Just shoot me. Bro! Hi, furry boy. Bondik... Bro, let's go, you're a total nut. -Let's go. -Quiet, so Grandma doesn't hear us. Come on... Hurry. Poor little thing, he was standing outside. He's all wet. Come on, close the window. Look, there's something written on it. "Kidnob"? That's "Bondik" backwards. Boys, what are you doing? What do you have here? Jeez. What is it? What are you doing? Help! -He must go up. -Okay. -Come on. -Go. Bondik... -Boys, I owe you an apology. -For what? -The headphones. I didn't believe you. I know it wasn't your fault. -We wanted to use it on Zvoníček. -Why Zvoníček? Mom, we know the password for Dad's computer. It was Bondik, just like the dog. Can we keep him? Please. -Okay. -Yay! -Come on, throw it. -Catch. -Another thing to worry about. -The boys deserve the dog. -You know he looks just like you. -Really? I totally recognize those bulging eyes, right? -What's his name? -Santa. -Poor thing. I hope you invited enough guests. Look at it. Bečvářová gave up but still, we had about a hundred kilo of salad at work. One rheumatic fisherman made me take five carps. I'm slowly getting used to those rivals. Okay, Vanda, let's start on those carps. Girls, grab it. Let's go... There'll be enough guests. People from Crime Investigations are coming. And there will be a surprise. -What? -It moved. I didn't know so many women would be here. Vanda called me at the last minute. Well, you can share it then. Don't worry about it. How do you like the carp? I soaked it in milk for two hours, but still, does it taste muddy? Not at all. I can't tell if it's a carp or a salmon. You know it doesn't surprise me about you? -Anything new in the case? -Unfortunately not. We need solid proof. The techs didn't get to the password protected file. You know, the Christmas rush. Don't know about you, but I don't talk about work at Christmas. Was it a good idea to invite them both? -What do you talk about, Zvoníček? -Wanna know? -It starts with an H, Heřman. -Hellboy? -Finished. -Finished. Wow, you really ate it all. No wonder, I couldn't wait for presents either. Right? We'll give you your present now. -It can't wait till after dinner? -I don't think it can. Turn off the lights. -Let's start. -It'll be some prank again, eh? Some new game, eh? The boys decoded the password on their Dad's computer. It was a piece of cake. It was Bondik. He had backed up everything, including that broken phone. For those of you who don't know, it's at our hotel. Go. You're not in a position to lay down conditions. For laundering I get a couple of mils for coffee, but I'm not moving any money. This is Pecold? I'm not the one who loses track of who gets paid how much. It's kind of my life insurance. Kalina uncovered a spider web. He has evidence, wants to take you down. You do what I say or else it's over. You won't watch till the end? Zvoníček! So this is our Christmas present. How do you like it? It... -It's evidently fabricated. -Of course. It's not what it looks like. -I often hear that from you. -Vanda... Well, this case will end up on the desk of some other DA. Fidlerová, do your job. The path was stomped thus. The path was stomped thus. Who stomped it, who stomped it? Mother of Jesus. -What about Cassandra and the whales? -Milada fell over from those whales. She'll have a C-section, so I'm off the hook. Boys, let's go. Hold him. -Aah, our desperados. -Hello. I hope you'll be good boys in the new year. Go sit down, I'll be right there. -I've sorted it out with the boys. -Glad to hear it. No presents? No. I decided to believe them... Azor. Azor? -Whom are you waving to? -An angel. But he's gone now.
