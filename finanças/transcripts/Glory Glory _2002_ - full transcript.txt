(MultiCom Jingle) (aggressive music) (bell ringing) (dramatic music, wagon rattling) (explosions) (bell ringing) (townsfolk screaming) - Come on, go! - Oh, there's a bottle there. I'm so scared. - It's gonna be alright. - Oh god, El! - Just keep up! (explosions) - Move it, move it! - [Woman] Help me! (screaming, explosions) (horses whinnying) - Come on, Jane! Open the door, open the door! (explosion) - [Woman] Watch out! (explosion, screaming) - Come on, come on! (crowd shouting) - Come on, come on let's make for the church. (explosions, shouting) - Oh my god! - Someone needs help! (explosions) - Help her, (mumbles)! - Come on! (eerie choir music) (sobbing) (screaming) (explosions) (dramatic music) - Tommy! Tommy! (single gunshot) No! (hooves thundering) Tommy... (voices shouting over one another) (soft, mournful music) - Oh, Hannah, I'm so sorry. (frantic gasping) - I ain't gonna hurt you, ma'm. I ain't gonna hurt you. Find out what happened, Wes. Bad enough we brought war into civilian homes without this. I want the scum that did this arrested, Billy Boy. God help me, I want them dead. - Come on. - I'm sorry. (man laughing) - Hannah, please! Please! - Yeah, Hannah, why don't you come back inside and play some? You want something to drink, girly, you want some of this? - [Ellie] No! (cruel laughter, muffled shouts) - No more. No more. No more! (gun firing) (dramatic music) (gun shots) - What the hell? (mumbles) (dramatic music) - All this for glory? Want a war? I'll give you a war. - Shh, shh... (dramatic music) (broken glass crunching) (dramatic music) - Boy, am I glad to see you, Wes. - Roy? - Posse just left. They could sure use your help. - Hey, Roy. That a badge you're wearing? - Yeah. Sheriff left me in charge. - Did he now? - What happened? - Half dozen gunmen blew the safe. It was spooky, you should have seen it. They had these hoods. - Did they get the money? - Anyone hurt, Roy? - Yeah, Frank Dorkins' kid and a drifter got shot up real bad. - Who's over at the saloon? - Just a bunch of drifters. Been sitting there since yesterday, robbery and all. Guess it weren't their money. What are you doing back? I thought you (mumbles)? - Yeah, well, someone bushwhacked old Wilbur. Shot him square in the back. - No, Wilbur's horse is right... Right over there. - And here I was thinking maybe we'd been following the wrong tracks. - Boy! Let's not get too hasty, now, okay? Let's stop and wait for the sheriff. He'll be back in a couple days. - Billy, Sil? Hit around the back. Can't wait a couple of days, Roy. They'll be long gone. You're the sheriff, Roy. What's it gonna be? - Well, I guess-- - Good. (tense music) Ready? (tense music) Packer, Packer! - Shouldn't have hit our spread, Pecker. - I dunno what you're talking about. - What's that? You never been near it? - That's right, (mumbles). - I suppose you didn't shoot old Wilbur in the back either. - Like I said. - That's funny. Yeah, cause you know, there's a horse outside. Says you're a skunk bellied liar. - Ease up, Jack. He'll have his day in court. - Yeah. And then, we'll hang you. I'll be there. - Is that right? - Watch 'em putting the noose around your neck. Watch your face turn green, tongue stickin' out of your mouth. Then I'm gonna smell the stench when you mess your pants. (guns firing) - I didn't fire, don't shoot. - You shouldn't have pushed him, Jack! - Why not? We would have hanged him anyway. - He had a right to a fair trial! - Yeah, well you tell that to the man they killed! (tense music) Wes? What do you got, Wes? - Was Pa's. Some bastard ripped it off him in Civil Creek the day he was killed. You should have seen it, Jack. There were more dead civilians in it than dead soldiers. I was supposed to have been there. I should have stopped him. - Wes. What happened at Silver Creek, not your fault. You were following orders. Your pa-- - My pa's dead! Don't you dare tell me about orders. That filth that ransacked Silver Creek gunned him down and left him to die in the dirt! If I'd have been where I should have been, it wouldn't have happened! Don't you talk to me about orders, Billy. Three years been trying to get a line on this scum, three years! - You hold on, Wes. You saying that that gang that knocked off that bank last night are the same renegades killed your pa? That what you think? - You're damn right. - I guess we're going after that posse, then. - Yup. (dramatic music) - Seems pretty quiet to me. - Don't like it, sheriff. - Guess there's only one way to find out. You stay here. Take three of the men. (tense music) (eerie choir music) (gun cocks) - [Hannah] That's far enough. - Careful, ma'am. We don't mean no harm. - Sheriff. - Ma'am. - I just died and gone to heaven. - You will if you ain't careful. - Sure is hospitable of, you ma'm. - Think nothing of it, mister. - Thank you, ma'm. - Howdy, how you doing? - Pretty damn fine, yourself? - Mighty good. - Come here, come here. (eerie music) (gasping) So, what are you and your men doing out here? - We've been following a bunch of thievin' bushwhackers. Hit the bank over in Twin Fogs. Real bad pieces of work. Being out here on your own, watch yourself, ladies. - Oh, we will, sheriff. We will. (guns firing, screaming) (guns firing, gasping) (horses whinnying, guns firing) - Time to die. - Ellie, stop playing and see to the rest. April, Becky, get the horses. (spitting) (tense western music) (eerie choir music) (tense music) - Sam? Aw, Sam... - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wes? Sil. Check the others. - Took you long enough. - Not much of a place to die. - Is there a good one? Why don't you go and see if you can pick up their trail? Go ahead, Sil, give him a hand. - Wes. Where's Sam? - Inside. Cut up, just like all the rest. - Aw, goddammit... God damn it to hell! How the hell did this happen? You tell me. Sam was a good lawman, he couldn't have just walked into no trap. - This ain't your fight, Jack. - What? What are you saying, you don't need our help? - No, I'm saying that that's a good friend of mine inside there and I don't feel like burying three more. - Well, we're in any condition to be buried, you sure as shit ain't gonna be around to do any shoveling. (tense music) - Roy was right, they're headed north. - Alright. Let's bury the dead and get the hell out of here. (steam hissing) - You were right, Hannah. It's just what we needed. I love towns! - What we did to that posse, I can't do it again. I can't, Sherrie, I want to go home. - I know, April. - Ungrateful bitch. - They wouldn't have lasted five minutes on their own and they know it. Might be nice, though, mightn't it? To stop? Hit a home, one with walls, I mean. Get a man. - Don't. You're scaring me. (laughing) - It's only a dream, Ellie. Only a dream. - Is it? Hell, ain't never too late. - Well, sure, what are we gonna do? Burn fees and robbing the dead of some godforsaken prairie for 14 hours a day so we can all get pregnant a thousand times and die, that what you wanna do? I didn't think so. - Hey, sweet thing, hey, come on back! I need you! (laughing) - Uh-uh, Widow. She is ours. Come on! (laughing) Gettin' in! - Hey, hey, bring her back over here, ladies, when you're done. (giggling) Oh, hell this place is makin' me horny. - Is that an invitation? - Ah, no. No, you use sex. - Because sex is power. - Power don't turn me on. - Well, it's what turns men on. Can't be raped up here. Nothing can touch you up here unless you let it. - Hannah, honey, I been raped. But when I make love, I make love. - I can make love. Can't I, sweetheart? I can make people love me. - Yeah, I'm sure you can. (dramatic music) - Stable the horses, Sil. Going to talk to the sheriff. - Scobie Fuller. - (mumbles). - Yeah, take this pen. Dip it that ink, get back here and sign on this line. You don't get your money. Right here on the line. When are you gonna learn writing? You might not look smarter, but you'll feel smarter. - Sheriff. - Be with you in a minute. Here's your money. Love the way you count money, Connors. We're done. - (mumbles). - Bounty hunters. Snake eaters, law says I have to pay the goddamn (mumbles). - Sheriff. - Yessir? - Who are they? - Not much known about 'em, except for the hoods. They been robbing banks all across the state of Texas since the war. - Yeah, well they hit Twin Forks a couple days back. - Yeah, Sam Shepard's dead, Ben. - [Wes] Killed him and his whole posse. - Damn. They're good. - I figured if they ain't here yet, they're coming. - You boys got any good news for me? - Oh hell, sheriff, we're here! - Thank you for that. They ain't rode in yet, sir. - They will. - Jack. Stay out of trouble. And take a bath. (mumbles). Keep your tallywhacker hidden. - [Jack] Okay, sheriff. Show me to the bathhouse. - [Sheriff] Follow your nose. (laughing) (lively can-can music) - I wants me one of them! (laughing) I (mumbles) see that again, girl! (crowd chattering) You done gone and pissed yourself, Deek! (laughing) - Sorry. - Go get him, boy! Shit! Ow! (guns cocking) - Okay, alright, alright. ("Yellow Rose of Texas") - Partner, you gotta relax now. - Don't crowd me, Jack. If I wasn't relaxed, he'd be dead already. - Wes, that bounty hunter's a piece of shit and you know it, you could have stepped around him. - Don't preach to me. I known you too long. - Wes? Goddamn it. - What's wrong with him? - [Jack] It's a long story. - Where you going? - For a walk. He's a beautiful animal. You mad at me or just the whole world? Your friends are having a good time. You're much nicer when you smile. I'm Hannah. - Wes. - Are you finished yet? - Some other time, maybe. - Sorry, shouldn't have come, good night. - It's just not a good time. - Oh, I understand. Whatever it is, I hope you work it out. Only... I'm a real good listener. (sultry music) (whooping and shouting) - Alright, alright, I surrender, you win! You win, woman, you win! Alright, alright, yeah. (laughing) - [Widow] You had enough? - My heart, my heart. - Oh, okay. - My heart, oh god. Damn it. How about a little something? - What's that? - Your first husband. (mumbles), right? (laughing) - Aw, no, no, that's 'cause I ain't never been married. - How do you explain that? - Well. I guess I just slaved away my whole life for the same old bitch since I was five. - Yeah? - Yeah. The widow Wilson. Widow Wilson, that's me. - Got it. - Nope, I ain't never had a real name. - What about Jane? - Janie? Widow Wilson had a brother. - Got it. - Yeah, Janie's a sweetheart. Deserves better than this. Ah, well, who doesn't? Anyway, don't get too much out of life thinking about what might have been. - Well, you live, you die, what's to care? - That is real bad talk, you know. Anyway, you still too young to be so cold. - I don't know. If it comes, it comes. - Alright, so what about you? You ever been in love? Alright, none of my business. - No, no, no, sure it's your business. I love every woman I take to bed. - I'll bet you do. - You mostly. - I'll bet you do! (laughing) - Where the hell have you been? Who is he? (laughing) - You're jealous. - I'm not. - He's nobody. - Swear? - I swear, sweetheart. (soft, tense music) I swear. Bit of fun, that's all. - You wouldn't lie to me. - I wouldn't lie to you. - I wouldn't like you to lie to me! I can smell him. - Oh, don't be silly. - Don't leave me, Hannah, please. Don't ever leave me. - I'm not gonna leave you, Ellie. Where would I go? (crowd chattering) - Ladies. Watch your drinkin'. Gentlemen. - Sheriff. - I have a report. No one of any importance just rode in or rode out of this own. - They will. - They got money in their pockets, they'll be wanting to spend it. - Maybe. - No maybe, they're here, they're coming. Today, tomorrow, next week. They're coming, I know it. They're coming. - Whoa, looks like Wes found himself a little distraction. - You boys pay attention, I'm counting on you. Good day, ma'm. Welcome to town. (tense music) - Mm, that gonna look so pretty. - I could get used to this! (laughing) - They followed us here. - What do you mean? Who followed us here? - Your stinking cowhands are what's left of the Twin Folks posse is what I mean. The whole damn town's mouthing off about it. - Jack say anything? - We didn't exactly talk much. - Well, that's just beautiful! - So they followed us here! So what? So what are we gonna do? If they are after us, they don't strike me as the type to give up easy. - We're gonna do exactly what we came here to do. They don't know who we are, which kind of gives us the edge, don't you think? - Hannah? Turns you on, don't it, knowin' they're after us? - Oh yeah. - Well, me too. - You know, I kind of feel sorry for the poor bastards. No, I really do! (laughing) (lively music, shouting) - (mumbles). (shouting, lively music) - [Dealer] 15 red. - I won! (lively music) (soft, melancholy music) - What's wrong? - This is crazy. - What's crazy? - This. You and me. (tense music) (sighing) - Are you gonna tell me what's eating you? - None of this is real. I came here to kill a man. Hannah, it's just not the right time, the right place. 'Til I done what I come to do, I can't focus on anything else. On us. - And do you think killin' a man will make you feel better? - You're damn right. He killed my pa. - I thought you were chasing the men who robbed the bank at Twin Forks. - They're one and the same. Three years ago, they ransacked a town called Silver Creek. Should have seen it. When they done, there weren't anything or anyone left that weren't broken or bleeding. - Three years ago there was a war, people died. Can you let it go? Even for us? - No. I'm sorry. This is something I have to do, I can't just let it go. It's eatin' me up inside, I'm havin' nightmares, for Chrissake! - Nightmares, I can fix. (dramatic music) (shouting, punches landing) - (mumbles), you getting sick or something? - Or something. - (mumbles) kind of cute. - Listen, dumb brain, it's us they're looking for, remember? Can't you see he's dangerous? - I know he's dangerous. - Is that what this is about? He turns you on because he's dangerous? - No. That general we killed at Silver Creek? That was his pa. - What? Are you nuts? Do you want to die? - No, I don't want to die, it's just... - You've fallen for him, haven't you? - Maybe Ellie's right, maybe we should just-- - Shut up, shut the fuck up, I need to think. - Well, ladies, it seems the army's putting its money away 'til they're sure we're gone. - (mumbles). Sight, seen. - All that money sure is a pretty sight. - Sure is, ma'm, sure is. - That bastard's always sloping around. We should take the bank and get the hell out of here. - You know, Hanna, for once, she's right. It's all gonna close in on us. - No, it's too risky. - Well, we don't got many choices. Sooner or later, we gotta stop. Might as well be with money in our pockets. - Stop and do what? - It don't matter what we do. We keep on like this, someone's gonna find out who we are. - We're all gonna die. Might as well die rich. - And Hannah, how many more dead posses do there have to be? - Alright. One last big hit. - It's the right thing, Hannah. - I can always come back for my cute cowhand later. - [Widow] When are we gonna hit the bank? - No time like the present, I guess. Won't get any easier. Let's go get the others. - Cheers. - So how'd you do? - Nothin'. - Nothin'? How long we gonna wait? Not that it ain't been nice, but been here damn near a week already. - I know, I reckon I was wrong. - Oh! - Alright, we'll ride out tomorrow, see if Billy can pick up their trail. - Well, I'll drink to that. (glasses clinking) - She's not leaving me. - What? - Hannah, she's not leavin' me. That Widow bitch keeping on at her. She's not splitting us up, I won't let here! - Mama don't mean nothing by it, Ellie! She only wants what's best for us, that's all! - Well, she'd better keep the hell out of my way. (eerie, tense music) (thunder rolling) (rock music) (shouting) (clock ticking) - Come on, move it! Get out, get out, move, move, move, move! - This time, you really did it! - Well, try leaving me now! - Get out! (guns firing, screaming) (groan of pain) (guns firing) - Janie, get the horses! Come on! Move, we gotta go! - Yah, yah! (horses whinnying) (guns firing) - [Ellie] Hannah! (guns firing) (glass shattering) (dramatic choir) - Yah! (rock music) - (mumbles)! Sil! - Janie! (guns firing) - Wes! - You alright? - Billy! Come on, Billy! Help me get him up. - (mumbles). Come on, alright, here you go. Here you go. Here you go, bud, alright? Get your feet. There you go. Wes, the doctor's on his way, okay? Here, stop that blood, Wes, right now, right now. Alright. I want you to hold that, your hand there, alright? - She made a fool out of me, Jack. I trusted that bitch. - I know, I know. Now listen to me, Wes, listen to me. I want you to stay put. I'm gonna take care of it, okay? (tense music) - That double crossing bitch. - Can you help me get her down? Come on, sweetie. Easy, easy now, just swing her up here. Come on, sweetie, you're gonna be okay. - She's dead, Widow. - She ain't dead. Come on, sweetheart. Come on, girl, you gotta wake up. - Widow, she's dead! - She ain't dead! She ain't dead... Come on, sweetie, you gotta wake up now. You gotta wake up. Come on, sweetheart, you gotta wake up, sweetheart. (sobbing) Janie... (mournful music) - Whoa. Whoa. (mournful music) - Damn. God damn it to hell... - Jack, it was her or Sil. - I couldn't shoot her, Jack. Sorry, I just couldn't. Let's leave it to the sheriff. Let's go home. - Can't, not now. Wes won't quit, we know that. And I... I gotta find out why I had to kill a 15 year old girl. (mournful music) - Yah, yah, come on. Switch horses. I'll go pay. - Who's there? Come on. Speak up. - Easy, pop, you might just shoot somebody. - You a woman? - Sure are. (laughing) - You sure are! What y'all doing way out here? - Seeing them horses. You wanna trade? - Them ponies ain't for trade. I'll need money, they're for buying. - Don't... Put it down. - What you do that for? - Well, I guess I just ain't gonna let you kill him. Been enough killin'. - Bit late to get all self-righteous on us, Widow. You done your fair share and so did that precious daughter of yours. - I know what I have done! And whatever Janie did or didn't do, that'll be on my conscious, not hers! And that stunt you pulled at the bank, that killed Janie! - So what? You haven't got the guts. - Easy, Widow, we gotta get out of here... - Yeah, Widow, it's not Ellie's fault. It's nobody's fault. - What you standing there for? Tie him up and see what's inside. And you see the horses. - I'm gonna kill you for this. (tense music) (grunt of pain) (tense music) (eerie choir music) (tense music) - Hah! (gunshot firing, horse groaning) (tense music) Why? Why'd you do it? - Why'd I do what? - Try the bank, bitch. The old folks, the posse, any of it. - You wouldn't understand. - Try me. - It was war. - War? - You know, war. You feel bad about Silver Creek, I'll tell you about Silver Creek, I was there. So was Ellie and the Widow. I had a son, you know that? He was four years old, four years old and they gunned him down in the street like a dog. And your militia, your precious guerillas, they beat the shit out of us and raped us, and this! This is war, captain, and it doesn't stop because some general says so! - Some general? My... What happened to my pa? - Your pa was in the wrong place at the wrong time. He came around that corner, just another uniform, and I blew his brains out. You want me to say I'm sorry? I'm not! See? You're just like all the rest. You're not mad at me for killing your pa. You're not even mad at me for robbing those banks or butchering that posse. You're mad because you don't care anymore. I made you love me. - You bitch-- - (tense music) (grunting) - Do it, Wes, do it. I'm the one that killed your pa. (tense music) - [Jack] Why don't you go on and help him? - He doesn't need my help. - Too hard on yourself, Sil. - I don't know if I can shoot a woman, Jack. - Don't worry about it. - Next time it's you they're aiming at or Billy, what then? - It won't happen. - You don't know that. (tense music) - You owe me one, lover. (groans) - Of all the dumb... (tense music) - See if you can find Hannah. - This place gives me the creeps. - Welcome home, Widow. Welcome to hell. (tense music) - Here. (crickets chirping) - Whoa. You look like shit. - That's funny, I feel great. (thunder crashing) (women and children screaming) (thunder crashing) - Die. Die! - Just take it easy, Ellie, okay? Ellie? - Time to die. - [Widow] Just put the knife down, Ellie. - Time to die! - Ellie! Don't. - Hannah? Hannah? (sobbing) - Shhh... It's alright, Ellie, it's alright. They're not here anymore. It's over. I won't let them hurt you again. - Alright, (mumbles), come on. So Wes, you think there's any chance in hell she's gonna let you take her in? - [Sil] But she could have killed him, she didn't. - If I go after her again, she's gonna have to kill me. - Then why go after her? - I gotta see this thing through. How we end it's up to her. You don't have to come along, Sil. Any of you. - No, I'm coming. I have to. - Me? - Yeah. - Well, I had to kill a 15 year old girl. Even if I never understand why I had to do that, still got to look her mother in the eye. - Billy? - They're outlaws. No different from Packer and his crowd. Hell, we went after them for a lot less reason. - Alright then. - (mumbles) Every single thing in this town is dead. We just ain't laid ourselves down. Sorry about Janie. Ellie-- - Yeah, well, Ellie's real sick. I guess it ain't her fault. - I can't control her anymore. - Yeah, I know. - We (mumbles). - No, Hannah. We stepped way over the line when we killed that posse. - Well, they're paying for it now. - Come on, let's get the hell out of here. - Go where? I'm not gonna live the rest of my life looking over my shoulder. Wes is gonna come, he's gonna come here. Let's just end it. - That's crazy, Hannah. - So leave. - You know I can't do that. But I think staying to face it when we can run is pretty stupid. (dramatic music) - They're out of sight, we need the edge. Just don't do anything. (tense music) - Come on out, Hannah. - Let him know we're coming out. - This is a mistake, Hannah. Hold your fire, we're coming out. (tense music) (eerie choir music) - So what's it gonna be? - I should have killed you when I had the chance. - They all make mistakes. (tense music) - Hannah. - I'm not backing off, Wes. You'll just have to kill me. - Get down! (guns firing, explosion) Down! (explosions) (guns firing) (dramatic music) (guns firing) (explosion) (grunts of pain) - You alright? - Widow, Jane, Janie, I... - Shh, don't, don't, you don't have to be sorry. I'd have killed you to stop you taking her in. She's dead now. And I am so tired of people dying who doesn't deserve to. - Jack! - He'll live. - Sil? - Never felt better. (laughing) (guns firing) - Just stay down, stay down. (horse whinnying) (guns firing) (tense music) (grunting) (grunts of pain) (shouting in pain) (gun firing) (gun firing) (gun firing) (dramatic music) (soft gasps) - I'm sorry, Ellie, I'm sorry. (strained gasps) (dramatic music) She really made a mess of you, didn't she? - Oh yeah. - If I begged you, Wes. If I begged you on my knees, would you swear not to come after me? - That's why you killed her, isn't it? To be free of her? - You won't, will ya? You won't swear, you'll just keep on after me. - You bet her life. - I thought you loved me. - Oh yeah. You're good at making people love you. But you see, you forgot how to love anyone back. - I didn't forget. They took it from me when they killed my son. I'm sorry you ever met me. (gun cocking) (gun firing) (dramatic music) (gun firing) (cry of pain) (soft music) - So what are you gonna do? - I don't know. Fresh start? San Francisco, maybe. Anywhere except where I already been. Wes? I couldn't let her kill you. The Hannah I knew, she wouldn't have wanted to kill you. Are you coming after me? - No. The war's over. - Come on, I'll walk you. (soft music) - Okay, boys. Let's go home. (soft, dramatic music) (MultiCom Jingle)
