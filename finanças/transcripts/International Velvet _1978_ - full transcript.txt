Love makes all the choices for us. When Sarah came into my life 8 years ago, I didn't want her, she didn't want me. In fact, she didn't want anybody. She was an orphan. My brother Donald and his wife both killed in a car crash, and that just left me, a once-famous aunt she'd never seen. And what did I know about loving somebody else's child? Still delayed. You don't think anything's happened, do you? - Yes. - What? The bloody thing's delayed, that's what's happened. Is this tea or coffee? Well, it's sold as coffee. Could be tea. Could be tea. Tastes like essence of boiled saddle leather. How do you think I ought to deal with all this? You mean Sarah? Help me write with some of your best dialogue. Last time I saw her, she... She wasn't much older than that. That was here, too, funny enough. They were all leaving for the good new life in Arizona. Now, come on, come on, off it. You worry too much. Children always cope with death. In books, you mean. No, I didn't mean that. They cope with it. You did. I did. P.A.: Your attention, please. The delayed British Overseas Airways flight 5-1-0 from New York has now landed. British Overseas Airways apologise for any inconvenience. Transit passengers should contact the B.O.A.C. Information desk in the event that they have made customs. Sarah? Are you Sarah? Hello, darling. I'm so glad you're down safely at last. Well, how was the flight? Oh, you must be worn out. You know, it's so lovely to see you again. I didn't want to come here. Oh... well... Here, let... let me take some of these. I'll take that. Uncle John's waiting for us over there. Would you like a taxi? No, no, we have a car. Thank you very much. All your other things got here safely. They came yesterday. I unpacked them for you and put them in your room. I thought it'd make you feel more at home. Uncle John's put up lots of pictures and posters, and, well, I really think you'll like your room. He's not my uncle. You're not married to him. No, that's quite right. Well, you can... you can just call him John if you want to. Or Mr Seaton. Whichever you prefer. Darling, will you put the car away, or shall I? I'll do it. All right. Now, the sea's down there, just around the corner. Fred, hello, boy. Freddie, Freddie. Come on, boy. Hello, come on. Oh, did you miss us? Do you like dogs, Sarah? Some. I had my own dog, except they wouldn't let me bring him. Some stupid rule. Well, we'll get him over. I know it's 6 months in quarantine, but we can go and see him. - I can't. - Oh, yes, you can. They let you go and see them. I gave him away. Oh... oh, well, that's different. I'll tell you what. Fred can be your dog. You'd like that wouldn't you, you silly old thing? I don't want another dog. Not ever. It's time to get up, darling. Don't want to be late for your first day at school, do you? I'm not going to that school. Oh, which school are you going to, then? None. Come on now. That's being silly. You'll like it once you get used to it and make some friends. Come on, I've made you a real American breakfast. Up you get. 1, 2, 3, up. Those are funny-looking pyjamas. If you make me go to school, I'll run away. You know, I did that once. Running away is boring. I'll give you a tip, though. Never run away on an empty stomach. So, come on. Come and have your breakfast first. I mean it. Well, I believe you, but... But you have to plan it. You see, my mistake was that I never planned it. I never had any money... I have money. I have real money, American money. All right, so you've got the money, and you're going to have breakfast before you go. Now, where are you running away to? Home. Oh... You're not really running away, because I won't let you, and I won't let you, because I love you, and this is your home now. Now, come on, let's tidy you up. There we are. That's better. Now, you listen to me. I know you're unhappy, but it's not going to be as bad as you think, I promise you. I felt just this way when I went to school the first day. It's going to be all right. Now, I've met your teacher, and she's really nice. Mrs White. Mrs White could you come here a minute? Now, listen to me. It's not going to be nearly as bad as you think it is. See you later. It's your mum, Pie. There, did you think I'd forgotten you? There we are. What a good boy. What am I going to do about her, Pie? Was I like that at her age? Was I? No, I always had you, didn't I? Hey... it was always you and me. There we are. Hey, braces, we've got a present for ya, a present from America, a dead G.I.'s finger, all the way from Vietnam. Well, we're really most grateful to you, George. Thank you. Well, it's always a relief to get 'em back so quickly. And alive. Well, good night, Mr Seaton. Night, George. Night. Night. She wasn't running away from us, our situation. She doesn't know our situation. She was just running. Look, her parents are dead, killed in horrifying circumstances. She's shipped off to a strange country, meets an aunt she doesn't know and an uncle who isn't her uncle, and dumped in some bloody awful school. Well, come on. I know all that, but why can't I talk to her? I hear myself saying things, and they're all the wrong things. I mean she's my brother's child, and I don't know anything about her. That isn't your fault. She lived in Arizona, for god's sake. Why should you know anything about her? You've lived with me for 6 years, and you know precious little about me. Except that you're a miserable sod and you're always right. Exactly. I'm a miserable sod, and I smoke too much, and I have a hang-up about marriage, and I love you very much, and we're going to live through it, and I'm also a potential pyromaniac, because I left a cigarette burning downstairs. Kiss me, you fool, before we burn to death. Listen, leave child psychology to me. I'll make a brilliant effort at breakfast. You really are dreadful, just like daddy used to be. Well, you complain when the dog begs at mealtimes, and then you go and feed him yourself. What? Oh, I'm sorry. What's your favourite food, Sarah? Peanut butter. I beg your pardon? Peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwiches. That sounds intriguing. Sounds revolting. Is that... is that very American? Probably why Americans have such rotten teeth. Well, you can talk. All of his teeth are false, Sarah. Any nice boys and girls in your class? Well, there must be some. Didn't they talk to you yesterday? Nobody talked to you. Why was that? Because I didn't talk to them. Why? You weren't frightened, were you? I mean... I mean, is that why you ran away? There must have been something. Can't you tell me? I might be able to help. He had a dead finger in a can. - Who did? - This boy. Wait a minute. Tell me again. He had a what? A dead finger. Well, I'm sure it wasn't a real dead finger. No, no, no, if the child saw it, she saw it. I mean, I'll take her to school this morning and sort it all out. I don't want you to take me to school. It's never so bad on the second day. I bet you come home tonight and say you've got a friend. I don't want any friends. Well, we handled that brilliantly. Textbook Dr Spock. We were useless to her in the beginning. 2 polite strangers who got in the way of her grief. I wanted to love her. I wanted that desperately. But I didn't like her. In the beginning, there wasn't much to like. John. Darling. John. John, wake up. Wake up quickly. She's gone again. Look, I'll get the car out, you ring the police, all right? Hello? Sarah. Sarah. Sarah. Get off. Come here. You stupid little idiot. What the hell do you think you're doing? Riding. You don't cheat me. You don't ever ride my horse. You don't ever ride my horse without my permission. Do you understand? What's so special about him? Just because he won some stupid race a hundred years ago... Now, you listen to me, and you listen very carefully, because I've just about had you. I'm sorry for you, very sorry, because I know you're unhappy. I know you don't want to be here, but that doesn't give you the right to make everybody else's life a misery. Now, do you hear that? That's because of you, and that's the second time in 48 hours, and believe me, the police have got something better to do than go rushing around the countryside looking for silly little girls. And if... and if you don't stop running away, they'll send you to a special school, and then you'll really have something to be sorry about. Are you listening to me? I didn't run away. What? I didn't run away this time. Well, how are we to know that? I mean, what would you think if you were John and me? Now, look, I don't want another word about it. From now on, would you just learn to do as you're told? And you learn to live with it. Everything all right, Mrs Brown? Oh, I'm sorry. It was a mistake this time, George, and I panicked. Right. I'll leave you to it, then. Who was it said, "people don't change simply because we find out more about them"? I said so many awful things to her, lashing out because I'd been scared, because I'd been running away, too. She'd made me think of things about myself that I wanted to forget. My mother swam across there to France. Well, not from just here, but from Dover, across the Dover channel. You know, that's over 20 miles and cold. The sea's always cold here. They have to smother you in thick grease, else you'd freeze before you got to the other side. How old was she? Oh... not very old. She won a hundred golden sovereigns. You know, they'd be worth quite a lot of money today. Then when I was about your age, she... she gave it to me so that I could enter the Pie for the Grand National. Did your mummy and daddy every tell you about that? You won, but you didn't get to keep the prize. It was a kind of winning. Prizes aren't everything. Where did you learn to ride? Home. Did you have a horse of your own? Nah. Look, I want to talk to you. I want to try and explain that, oh... The tide's on the turn. Come on. Shall I let you in on a secret? Old Pie is going to relive a bit of his notorious past in a few weeks time, a very special occasion. So, I've got to get him really groomed and looking smart. Would you, would you like to help me? Got to make him look a very beautiful old gentleman. What for? Ah, well, that's the secret. But... We can share looking after him. Would you like that? You see... The reason I... The reason I shouted at you, the reason I was so cross last night... Well, grown-ups often get cross when they're scared, and... You can't get scared if you don't care about somebody. You see, I know you won't believe this, but I need you. I need you just like your mummy and daddy needed you. They didn't. Of course they did. They didn't. They didn't need me. They didn't need anybody. Why do you say that? Because they didn't. They never did. Well, that's why they always left me. Left you? Oh, Sarah, darling, that's not true. It is. You didn't know them. It wasn't your father. It was just your brother. The more she told me, the more I realised her life had been little more than a cut-out, just an outline pasted onto a human being. I guess the only irony was the reason she was alive and Donald and his wife were dead was because they never took her on that last trip. From what she said, they never took her anywhere. Women are supposed to have instincts. I didn't have that many. Perhaps it's only mothers who have them. P.A.: My lords, ladies and gentlemen, before the next event, I have a very special ceremony to perform. There may be some of you tonight who remember the year when the Grand National was won by a 14 year-old girl. It was cause for celebration and, alas, cause for disappointment. Because, although she won and won fairly against all the odds, she was disqualified under the rules. But rules or no rules, she and her equally remarkable horse, the Pie, were first past the post on that memorable occasion. I won't tell you how long ago it was, but tonight we are here to pay tribute to Velvet Brown, "National Velvet," as she was immediately nicknamed. Because tonight, the time has come for the Pie to be retired from stud. It comes to us all, but perhaps not so publicly or so pleasantly. So, my lords, ladies, and gentlemen, I ask you to pay your tribute to National Velvet and Pie as they do a lap of honour. ♪ Should auld acquaintance ♪ ♪ Be forgot ♪ ♪ For sake of auld lang syne ♪ ♪ For auld lang syne, my dear ♪ ♪ For auld lang syne ♪ ♪ We'll take a cup of kindness yet ♪ You did win, really, didn't you? I guess I did, in a way. Well, we did. Will there ever be another horse like him? There might. You never know. There might. Good-night. Night, night. Sleep well. It was the Pie's last foal. And I think the owner got his money's worth, all right. Could you call a horse "Arizona Pie"? 27, 28, 29, 30. If you wanted to. That's what I'd call him. You think? I expect he'd be very expensive. - Oh, yes. - How expensive? How expensive would he be? I don't know offhand, but a lot of money. Yes, I would expect so, seeing as how the Pie was his father. Oh, that's not right. Darling, I can't help you with this maths. I mean, I don't even understand the questions. Are you busy? Am I busy? No, I wouldn't say so. As a matter of fact, I'm suffering from a bad attack of what is known as "writer's block." Oh, no. Is it painful? Very. Can I get you an aspirin? I don't think an aspirin would cure it. You could get me an inspiration, if you'd like. That's all right. I won't tell. - Thank you. - What are you up to? Nothing much. I wondered, are there any jobs you'd like done? Well, what sort of jobs? Anything. I'm trying to earn some extra pocket money. See... I... Might be able to help you with your block. Now that would be wonderful. How much do you charge? Oh, I'll work for anything. How about... 20 pence an hour. Perfect. Let's see, I could get up early and do an hour before school and then another hour after my homework, and on the weekends, I could probably work most of the time. That seems like a very good deal to me. I should probably be able to retire. When could you start? Right now. Right. Now, there's only one snag. You see, writer's block is, is very catching. I don't think we'd be able to work in the same room. So you go away and think up a story. Could you do that? And then when you've thought of it. And written it down, you bring it back to me. And if turns out to be a bestseller, I'll double your wages. How does that sound? 50, 60, 70. Thank you. Terrific. "About 11:00 in the morning" "of that third day," "when all 4 of the ship's company" "were at the lookout place" "at the northern end of the island." "The mate was sewing a button on the boy's shirt..." Just a moment, Janet. Sarah Brown, what are you doing? Nothing, Miss. Carry on, Janet. "And as the boy was busy..." I can't play with you, because I've got to work. And I'm only doing it for you, so don't interrupt. Listen to this. "Whenever Julia came into the stable, "the young groom felt his knees give way. He could see her heaving bosoms..." That's a bit dicey, isn't it? "And knew that she wanted to marry him, "but could not say so, because her father was a man of..." What's that? "Violent"? "Violet"? Violet rages. "Rages. So, they panted at each other..." Oh, my god. "While they saddled the horse, and sometimes they held hands. But it wasn't the real thing." Sounds like the real thing to me. I may have created a monster. Harold Robbins, eat your heart out. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. I think I've got enough now. How is that, then? I've been working, you see, earning lots of money, and I've saved it all. My word, yes. So I've come to buy him, like you said. Is it enough? Oh, I'd say that would be enough, all right. Yes. Well, it would have been? Would have been? He's been sold, you see. Sold? Somebody came and bought him. Only yesterday. But they can't have bought him. I've been saving up. Well, it's unfortunate-like, in the circumstances, but I didn't know, you see. I... I didn't know you were so keen. Well, had I known that you were serious-like, I'd have waited. Well, I didn't have the knowledge of your bid. Expensive things, foals, you see. Why, they cost a lot to feed. So I had to take the first definite offer I had. I'm really sorry, young lady. Was it somebody nice who bought him? Oh, I wouldn't send him anywhere nasty. Well... thank you very much. Hello, darling. You're late today. Look what I got for tea. They keep you in at school? Whew. You seem a bit depressed. Are you? Sort of. Oh, well, don't be depressed. It can't be that bad. Why don't you... Why don't you go and see old Pie? He'll soon cheer you up. Oh... Well, that's funny. I can't see him. He's not in the field. You don't think he's got out, do you? I think you better go and check. It's the foal. It's the foal. Aunt Velvet, it's great. Thank you. Watching Sarah and the foal grow together, I saw bits of my own life more clearly than ever before. They say that when you're older, you see things differently, but it wasn't true. I saw everything happening the same way. History about to repeat itself. She was tougher than me, much tougher than I'd been at her age, and she didn't really need people. She just wanted to win on her own. All I hoped was she wouldn't win too early and afterwards have nowhere to go. P.A.: Quiet, please. The next one is number 17, Miss Sarah Brown on Arizona Pie. Excuse me. Cigarette? No, thank you. I don't smoke. Great. Oh. Oh... Hello, Sarah. I thought you were terrific. Do you remember me? I'm Alan Wilson. I once frightened the life out of you with a... Well, I was watching you just now. I took some pictures of you winning. I didn't win. I came in second. Oh, well done, darling. Oh, it was such a pity about that last fence. I so wanted to win so he'd notice me. Who, me? Captain Johnson. He trains the Olympic team, and he's one of the selectors. Well, I'm sure he did notice you. Goodbye. Oh, goodbye. And thank you very much for taking photographs. - Pleasure. - Thanks very much. He seems quite a nice boy. Yes, he's all right. I just wish I'd done better. Oh... I think, you know, darling, you try too hard sometimes. You can't try too hard. I wonder how old she is? I used to think I was obsessed. But Sarah rode for dear life. She felt she was last in the race if there was anybody else in front of her. Finished paying for it, then, have you? You wait till I get a jag, George. Hey. - Good morning, lads. - Yeah. Taking a half? All right. How's it getting on? Not so bad. Imagine doing that for money. Listen, I'd pay them. Yeah. Suss this. Oh, I say, I say. It's the old Barclay hunt. Hey, you do know you've got a horse between your legs, don't you? Leave her alone. She's all right. She's a stuck-up little cow. Come on, let's get Richie up. Be a giggle, won't it? Keep going. We've got her now. Whoo-hoo. Come on, hurry up. Hey, hey, hey. All right. We got her. Around we go. Look out, darling. We're coming. You won't do that again. Come on, darling, get off with you. Look out, Charlie. I've got a visitor for you. Come on, Alan. Just 5 minutes. How do you feel? Ok, I guess. Sore. I got concussed once, with football. Did you ever recover? What? Oh, sure. I, thought this might cheer you up, give you a laugh. Will you open it? Well, it's not what you might think. I've stopped giving dead fingers. Oh, Alan, it's just lovely. Thank you. There's a letter, too... You should read when I've gone. What happened to the boys in the car? Nobody seems to tell me anything. Well, they... They died. I wasn't supposed to tell you. I mean, they were sort of my friends, but I knew what they were like. But I wouldn't want you to think they were awful or... or anything like that. It... it's just that they... They did stupid things sometimes. You mustn't blame yourself. Let's just forget it. My dog Fred died that summer, too, but everything else was just the same. Sarah was more determined than ever, and poor, faithful Alan was constantly left at the gate. Well, tell her I'll call again. Oh, yes, I'll tell her. What did he want? Just to see you. He's taking riding lessons now. I'm not always going to do your dirty work for you, you know. It's not my fault, is it? Well, some of it is. If you don't want to see him, put him out of his agony. But I do want to see him... Just not all the time. It's just that when I know I can take somebody for granted, I seem to go off them. Then tell him. It's hurtful this way. But weren't you ever like that? Me? Oh, I don't know. It was a hundred years ago. But you were like me. You told me. You told me you were only interested in the Pie and that nothing else mattered. Why did you stop riding? Well, it was the oldest reason in the world. I lost my nerve. Well, you see, I was... I was married then. You married? Yes. Don't look so surprised. But I thought you didn't believe in marriage. I don't believe in some marriages. What happened? Oh, I did a lot of things wrong, things I wish I hadn't done, stupid things we all do when we want to hurt somebody, and, well, I ended up the loser. Sometimes, getting what you want is a kind of losing. Quite a few Alans came and went. She baffled them all, just as she baffled me most of the time. She was always the fox who never got caught. Aren't you funny? Why? Why do you say that? You're so funny... Taking riding lessons, talking about helping me. That's not what you really want, is it? Isn't it? Why don't you go ahead and kiss me? Get it over with. I'm a bit of a disappointment, aren't I? No. Not to me you're not. I'm never gonna be what people expect me to be... But I know exactly what I'm gonna do. I've got it all planned. I'm gonna get chosen for the British Olympic team. So? You don't have to become a nun. Anyway, you can't. Can't what? Ride on the British team. You're American. Wrong. I was born here, and I've still got my British passport. All right. How do you know they'll pick you? They'll pick me. I'll make sure of that. Hey, it stopped raining. Thanks for lending me this, and don't feel badly. There's nobody else. It's just me. Bye-bye. Anything for me? John? Anything for me? Yes, there's something for you. You open it. No, I never open other people's mail, especially women's. Oh, please? Ha ha. You know who it's from? I'm guessing. I'm hoping. If it's no, just say it quickly. "Dear Miss Brown, I am writing on behalf "of the combined training selection committee "to inquire if you and your horse Arizona Pie "are available to train as possibles "for the British team that will compete "at the Ledyard 3-day event in America this year. "If you're able to accept this invitation, "I would ask that you and your horse "arrive at the Windsor training establishment "on the 20th day of this month, "for further evaluation and training. I am, yours sincerely, J.R. Johnson." All right, young lady. You can come in now. Good. Tell me something. What made you think you were good enough? What on earth gave you that idea? I've won prizes. Really? What for? Riding. Oh. Well. Wouldn't exactly call it riding, would we? Staying on a horse, perhaps... And, tell me, where did you learn - what you call riding? - Arizona. Oh, in the colonies, yes. Well, that explains it, doesn't it? Oh, well. You... you realise that they don't admit cowboys to the Olympics, don't you? I will say one thing, though, you've somehow managed to get yourself a promising horse. Yeah. It's your promise we're talking about, though, isn't it? You have to go back to the beginning and start from scratch. You're not going to cry, are you? - No. - Good. 2 things I can't stand in life: Bad losers and criers. Now, when I take somebody, if I take somebody, they come on my terms, and they work my way. My way happens to be quite frightening to most people. Had you heard that? Well, you're hearing it now. No nonsense, no temperament, no alibis, and certainly no question of my admitting that I'm ever wrong. Just hard work, very few compliments, lots of shouting, occasional bad language, for which I never apologise, and total dedication, like the ballet. Now, are your parents rich? My parents are dead. Oh. I'm awfully sorry about that. Who looks after you, then? - My aunt. - I see. Is she well-heeled? I don't know. Well, you'd better find out, because this isn't a cheap sport, you understand, and you get precious little help from the general public. They like us to win medals for them, but they don't like to pay, do they? No. So, you'd better have a chat with your aunt and, and give me a phone call and tell me when you can start. When I can start? Yes. Isn't that what I said? Does that mean you're gonna take me? I'm not gonna take your aunt. One of you is enough. I daresay we'll make something of you in due course. You're not too bad for a cowboy. Give me a phone call. Did you hear that? He's gonna take us. Yippee. Look, darling, obviously, we'll do everything we can to make it work, but there's no use pretending it's going to be easy. I know it. Really, I do. Getting the money is a problem, but that's our problem, not yours, and until we know exactly what's involved, I don't want you to get depressed. I'm not depressed. I mean, it's enough just to be chosen by him, isn't it? Well, I mean, of course it is. Now, off you go to bed, and let us talk it over. Ok, ok, I'm sorry. What are you sorry about? Well, I don't like giving you worry. I'm not worried. I'm just bankrupt. I'm only kidding. Good night. Go to bed. Sleep well. Well. Yep. As we were saying when the gas was cut off. How much do you think we're talking about? Probably a few thousand before we're through. Well, that's all right. I thought you were gonna say a few thousand. You don't feel like winning the Grand National again, do you? Oh... Why are things always so complicated? It would break her heart, I suppose, if we didn't find it. Yes, I really think it would. Have you got any more jewellery you can flog? Not even a wedding ring. Well, I'll just have to think of something. Don't worry. I mean, I'll come up with the answer. You know something? What? When you're not being a disagreeable sod, you're really halfway to being very nice. Isn't that funny? Women have always said that. You go to bed, too. Otherwise, flattery will get you everywhere. Go on. I want to think. Don't stay up late. It's funny how you can live with somebody, sleep with them, know every intimate detail, except those infidelities forced on them by generosity. What's this? What? "Lust valley?" Oh, that. Well, that's just something. Oh. "Just something" is right. It's something else. Did you write this? No. No. It was written by a character called, Jack Delacroix. Jack Delacroix... I don't know any Jack Dela... It's you. Oh. Is it you? Oh, it isn't. Is it? You like his style? Well, he writes a mean seduction scene. Does it turn you on? Well, you know, I've only read a few lines. Well, read a few more. Spoil yourself. You see, Mr Jack Delacroix doesn't have my artistic scruples. He's only in it for the money. Where did he do all his research? That's what I'd like to know. Oh, he's been around. Publishers like his stuff, being men of taste and... Perception. They pay well. They wouldn't pay enough to keep a horse in oats, would they? They might. Oh, you're so devious, Seaton. Just, call me Jack... And, turn out the light. Why, you mean turn out the light? Oh, yes. Would you like, to read some more, huh? No. Just tell me how it ends. Well, I may have to, improvise. Oh, why, Jack. I don't know you that well. But this is all part of the creative process. Oh, my god. I came into bed with my slippers. No, no, no, no, no. Come on. Stop. Now start again. This is dressage, and it's meant to be like a ballet, Mr Clark, not a barn dance. You're like a pregnant Tom Mix. Don't ask me who Tom Mix was. It was all too long ago, and I can't remember. All right, once more, and not with feeling. Please spare me that. Now, some of you may have come here with the impression that dressage is frightfully boring compared to the greater glories of the cross-country event. That's because you all lack sophistication, amongst other things. The origins of dressage, however, are very deeply rooted in the classical tradition, so you just have to approach every dressage test as if it were... A concerto of Bach. That's Bach, as in the German composer, Mr Armstrong, not bark, as in "dog." Now, to perform it well, you also have to have an appreciation not only of my subtle wit and whimsical humour, but an appreciation of the beauty of form, marriage of man and beast. It's an emotional experience, but emotion undone, control. I hope you're suitably impressed by the quality of my language, Miss Godfrey... Not just a pretty face. Do you understand? Now, we come to the cross-country event. The cross-country event is considered by some, Miss Brown, to be an opportunity to display carefree abandon. This is a mistake for which I would cheerfully reintroduce capital punishment. It is a test of brains, and since horses are only marginally less stupid than some of the people who ride them... An observation which carries with it the experience of a lifetime... I would urge you not to sit on your brains, but to use them. Everything is terrific here. We seem to work 25 hours a day, and there isn't time for anything else. Competition is fierce, because everybody wants to impress the great Captain Johnson, who is one of those very British British. Everybody says he's got a velvet fist and an iron glove, and I apologise for using your name in such a dirty context. My social life is something to behold. There's a 4-letter word for it. Arizona is fine and the envy of all. He's definitely in a class by himself and is getting very conceited. But don't think I'm not having fun, and don't think I'm not still grateful for making it all possible. Excuse bellying over my strong point. Darling? It's not darling. It's me. No complaints. We got the day off. Captain Johnson suddenly went ape and cancelled class. Well, god bless Captain Johnson. His loss is our gain. How's it going? Ok, I guess. Next week's the big crunch. Next week? Yes. That's when they make the big selections. I'm starving. Is there anything to eat? Don't they feed you down there? The horses eat better. Are you depressed about something? You sound a bit down. No, not really. Well, let's have a look. Oh, there's the gourmet peanut butter and, something that looks like a very nasty piece of cheese... And in fact, is a very nasty piece of cheese. I'll make a sandwich. That's fine. Do you want what you call the jelly and we call the jam? I... Could never understand that. What? It's a taste sensation. No, no, no. No. Not for me. No. Come on. Try it. All right. Why not? So, you're not depressed. Well, yes and no. I mean... I don't know what makes me tick. I know what I'm doing wrong. I just can't seem to do anything about it. Well, what do you think's wrong with you? Well, I'm not making friends. I mean, I didn't want any friends at first, and now that I do, it's... I can't seem to go about it right. Did you ever have that problem? Well, are we... are we, talking about, sex? By "friends," do we read boyfriends, because I never had any boyfriends. Any. I wouldn't be picky. You know, this isn't bad. This is not bad. I could be converted. I mean, you can't really... How shall I put it? You can't really wake up in the morning and say to yourself, "today, I'm going to make a couple of friends." It just doesn't work like that. It's like falling in love in a way. Sometimes it takes you by surprise... And sometimes it's there all the time, and you just haven't seen it. Well... well, look, to tell you the truth, I don't know. I mean, you can't know for anybody else. All I can tell you is that it'll happen. You just have to find someone who likes your brand of peanut butter. You want another? No. Well... Another thing. I don't have any nerves. At least, not when I'm riding, anyway. I mean, that's when... When it's all going for me. Will I lose that like Velvet? Did she tell you she lost her nerve? In a way. Well, I mean, that... That was kind of a white lie, you know? She didn't really lose her nerve. She... She lost a child. Well, it wasn't my child. She was married then. She fell, you see, while she was riding, while... while she was riding the Pie, and, she couldn't have any children after that, and then I came along, and... Well, I guess I wasn't much help... Because my little hang-up is that... I'm frightened of anything that's signed, sealed, and... Permanent. Listen, this, peanut butter's like a truth drug. Funny, you know, but to write and to live... Very different, you know. You, decided which method of suicide you'll use if you're not on the list? Ah, well, I've, given myself a choice. I'll either go to Japan and get myself massaged to death, or, if I can't raise the fare, I'll become a liberal M.P. I just wish it was all over, one way or the other. Oh, you're all right. He's bound to choose you. Why do you say that? He, goes for the older women. Pig. Either I make this as quick and as painless as possible. Despite all evidence to the contrary, I don't enjoy these occasions. They remind me of the time when I left my first wife. It was a choice between her and the horses, and the horses cost less to feed. I don't think you have to laugh. My rare jokes always have tragic undertones. Now, the team for Ledyard was a difficult decision to make, because naturally, under my tutorage, you're all absolutely brilliant. I was choosing a team, so the components had to fit, all right? So, the final selection is as follows... Beth... Howard... Mike... Roger. Now, the, reserve rider... Will be Sarah. Congratulations to you 5, and my commiserations to those who didn't make it this time. Now, don't take it too badly, because the great thing about this sport is it's here to stay. Thank you. Off. Cabin compressors. Off. Galley power. Off. Right. All set, then? Yes, fine. Right. Well, let's go and get this bus off the ground. How is he, Roger? Ok? Well, he's not too bad, Tim, but he's not, too happy, either. Right. We're about to take off. Whose is this? Do you like flying with horses? Yes. They don't pinch your bottom. Would you like to take your seats now, please? Yeah. Thank you. Come on, Sarah. Oh, yes. Yes. Hello. Ooh. Hi there. You can get your seat belt off. Thank you. What would you like for lunch, skipper? Well, what's the choice? There isn't any. Oh, well, I'll have that, then. 3 times? You watch the match of the day last night, George? Yes, I caught most of it. What did you think of it? Lousy penalty in the first half. Did you watch it, David? Oh, hello. Everything ok? Yes, fine. Are we going to have a smooth trip? Yeah, should do. Well, could be some clear air turbulence. Just a bit. The weather report's too good. Always suspicious when the old map man gives us a clean sheet, aren't we, George? You can say that again. Well, I know what I wanted to ask you. Are your lot worth having a bet on? A bet? They're not racehorses they're eventers. Don't you know the difference? Well, no. Golf's my game. Hello. Is that the, clear air stuff? Yes, it doesn't, show on the radar. It would probably be better if you, go and strap yourselves in for a bit till we get through this stuff. Shouldn't last long. I'll try and climb above it. Don't worry. They're well secured. That's a good girl. Steady, boy. I think you'll have to give him a shot, Tim. It's ok. It's all right. There, there. Hey. Whoa, whoa. Johnny, will you get my bag, quick? Steady, steady, steady. Thanks. Howard. Mike. Get up front. Look after your own horses. That's it. Can you do a bigger shot? It's a bit dicey, sir. If I give him too much, there's always a chance it'll kill him. If I don't give him enough, he'll kick the plane to pieces. Do what you can. Godsend. Whoa. Whoa. Come on. Steady, steady, steady. Come on. Come on. Captain, I need your help back here, please. Right. George, you have control. Hey, hey. Steady. Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Can you give me a bit more on number 4, Dave? Try and keep him up. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Has he had an injection? Yes, but it's gone beyond that now. Hold the damn thing. Hold it. Look, I'm sorry to lay this on you, but you're going to have to destroy that horse. And if it helps, I'll make it an order. Now, do it, and do it quickly, before the rest of them go berserk. We've got a long way to go. Damn. Johnny, let me try a bit longer. I know he'll be all right. I know he will. Whoa. It's the Captain's decision. He's taken it. Unfortunately, I think he's right. Just get on with it. Do it now. Let's hope it's the only one. Don't look, Sarah. It's all right. It'll all be over very quickly. Oh, poor Roger. Steady, boy. Steady. Whoa, come on. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Come. Steady. Hold him steady if you can. He didn't feel anything. Don't worry. It was very quick. Kennedy approach, 1-2-3 point 7. Hello, George Alpha. Welcome to Boston. You're cleared for cargo exit 7. There's a meat waggon on its way. Sorry you had such a rough trip. Not much of a welcome to Boston, I'm afraid. We heard the terrible news, and some of us felt we should come down and... You know. Whose horse was it? Roger Peacock's. Gold Dust. That's terrible. That's always been my nightmare. If there's anything we can do, don't hesitate to ask. Yes, thank you very much. Think I'll get to ride tomorrow? No idea. But we'll know soon enough. That guy who was talking to you in the airport. Scott Saunders, you mean? Is that Scott Saunders? He's good, isn't he? He's very good. Have you ever ridden against him? Not only ridden against him, but on one particularly happy occasion, ridden over him. All right. There's no sense in dwelling on yesterday's tragedy. Unfortunately sorrow does not win competitions, otherwise I'd be a 3-time gold medallist. So, Roger, you will ride magic instead. Sarah, I'm entering you as an individual competitor. It'll give you the feel of an international event without the responsibility of worrying about the team. What is it, Mike? You obviously haven't heard. No. What? Well, Tim thinks there's some doubt about magic. I thought he'd told you. No, I've been with the committee all morning. All right, where is he now? He's on the other side, making a final check. Come on, let's go. I'm sorry, Johnny. He's slipped his stifle. He can hardly put any weight on it at all. Isn't there any chance at all that he could start? In 3 days? No way. Just isn't our trip, is it? What now, sir? Well, we don't have any choice, do we? You'll have to ride Arizona instead. You've got 3 days to get used to him. Let's hope the jinx stops there. May I say something? If it's to the point, yes. If it's personal, no. It's just that nobody but me ever's ridden Arizona, and I just don't know how he'd go for anybody else. He's a team horse. Roger is our most experienced rider. Does that mean I don't get to ride at all? Exactly. Anything else? Carry on. I saw what you did this morning. Don't think I didn't. Now, just because I'm not gonna be with you, that's no reason to sulk or get upset or act up. Now, you just go out there and show them how brilliant you are. Are you listening to me? Hello. Why aren't you at the party? No particular reason. I just thought I'd look in on Arizona. Oh. I don't suppose you care overmuch for the decision I made today. You did what you thought was best. All right. As you pointed out this afternoon, Arizona goes best for you. Of course he does, he'll always go better for you because he's your horse, isn't he? Nevertheless, Roger has a couple of things going for him that you haven't got. Can you tell me what they are? Experience? Judgement, really. Judgement. It's knowing how fast you can push a green horse over a strange course and still finish. There's something else even more important. I'll tell you what that is. You see, Roger has the ability to sacrifice his vanity for the... And that's saying a lot. He has the ability to sacrifice his vanity for the good of the team. Well, I don't get it. How can he help the team more if he gets less out of Arizona than I do? Oh. Because he'll finish on Arizona. He'll finish on this horse. Ah, maybe not in such good time, but at least he'll get round, and we shall have a team score. Now, you might get round faster and, who knows, perhaps brilliantly. Then on the other hand, you might not get around at all. It still seems pretty unfair. Yeah, well, there you are. It's a pretty unfair process altogether, isn't it... Living, growing up? What's even more exasperating, everybody seems to think they know better than you, don't they? Myself included. You see, I'm absolutely convinced that I know better than most people. But then, that's my problem. It is all right. You shall ride for me one day, dear Sarah, because I have promised you that, now, haven't I? You will ride not only for me, but for the greater glory of the sport and for the triumph of the team. Those are not just empty words, believe me. You see, there's... There was a very interesting, very wise Frenchmen once, and he had a great deal to do with our Olympic games. His name was Kuberton, Bareunt Kuberton. He was an interesting fellow. And he said, "what is impor..." And I can't quote him exactly, of course, but he said, "what is important in the games is not the winning, but the taking part." Just as in life, the most important thing is not the triumph, but the struggle. Ah, in other words, not to have conquered, but to have fought well. You see? I don't know if that makes any sense to you, but that's what he said. Makes an awful lot of sense to me. All right, the sermon is over. Now, why don't you go and put on a party frock, and you can take me to this dance. Now, I may not be the youngest you'll dance with, but I'll certainly be the safest. Well, what do you say, cowboy? All right. Good. Like losing a best friend. Come on, Johnny. You can't monopolise the talent all evening. I'm cutting in. All right. Thank you. Thank you, Sarah. Good night. You make one false move with her, you'll never ride again. Good night. Thank you. That was easier then I expected. I'm Scott Saunders. - I know. - How do you know? Beth and I were talking about you. You're Sarah, the British secret weapon. Yes. So secret I'm not even riding. Roger's got my horse. That isn't a British accent. Would you believe Cave Creek, Arizona? Ah, you defected, huh? Actually, I escaped. You still kept your accent. Yes, I kept everything. I don't give anything away. Ledyard was the low watermark of our fortunes that year. Or the high watermark, depending on your point of view. I felt I would have done better as a swimming coach. P.A.: Riding in sixth place so far, with a score of 73.73... Riding a strange horse in an international dressage competition, as Roger had to do, is not designed to make friends or impress judges. Dressage in pouring rain is like dancing swan lake in clogs in a bog. The greater glory of the sport was somewhat obscured from view that first day. P.A.: Coming down to the coffin... He-yah. The cross-country course was very tough, tough from beginning to end, brilliantly designed to test horses and riders to the limit. Oh. Ooh. Yeah. P.A.: Oh, it just pops right over that... And pops right over that. That's why they call it a bionic tonic. Get. Get. P.A.: And he's coming down now... Galloping up to the table... Nicely over the table... Sarah's horse Arizona had great spirit, but he knew he had a stranger on his back. Roger rode him well and got round, as I had predicted. Nothing for the record book, but no disgrace. We were more fortunate than some. Some didn't get round. Some got round the hard way. P.A.: And she's off. As I told Sarah, Ledyard is unique. I mean, the new England razzmatazz is a lot of fun for the spectators, of course, but the riders have to know their stuff. I discovered a lot from our trip. For example, I felt I'd got close to Sarah for the first time. Also, I had a chance to study our weaknesses and our strengths. Quite a few weaknesses and not too many strengths, as it happened. But something to build on for the future. P.A.: And now, our gold-medal champion, the great mare Ballycor, number 135, with Ted Coffin. P.A.: What more can be said about Ballycor other than her great win at Montreal at the Olympic games? The dream of any 3-day event. Ballycor and Ted Coffin... For the United States. Our American hosts wiped us out. And, we came away as we had arrived... One down and a long way to go. Hello, Alan. Hello, stranger. I'd heard you were back. How's it been going? Oh, I'm ok. I'm getting married. Anybody I know? Sheila Gardner. Remember her? Oh, yeah. Congratulations. How's the riding? Oh, I've given that up. Too expensive, and I didn't see much point. We were... Hoping to see you on the television. You will one day. Nice to see you again. Nice to see you, too. Sarah. Sarah? Oh, there you are. I thought I heard you come in. Well, have a good ride? Yeah. What's wrong? Nothing. You worried because you haven't heard anything? No. You know what they say? No news is good news. Your coming home after all that excitement, it's bound to be a bit of an anticlimax. I tell you what. Why don't we go up to London and see a show? I have to train. You don't have to train every minute of the day. Well, I need a new saddle. What's wrong with the old one? It's just not good enough. Saddles don't win medals. I didn't say they did. Why are you in such a foul mood? I'm not. Well, it seems that way to me. Who is Jack Delacroix? Why do you ask? Because I've been reading this. It's John, isn't it? He's Jack Delacroix. What if he is? Well it's real disgusting trash. I don't know how he could write such stuff. Don't you ever say that again, not ever. As a matter of fact, John would agree with you. He's not too proud of it, either. He also thinks it's trash, but he's entitled to think that. You're not. And I'll tell you why not. That trash has paid for everything you've done in the past year and will probably pay for that new saddle you think you have to have. So before you pass any smart moral judgements, just remember the world doesn't owe you a living. Nothing's for free, and some people pay more than others. So don't you ever mention that again. Sarah. Sarah. Sarah. It's arrived. They've chosen you. They what? They've chosen you for the Olympics. You're kidding. Did you hear that, Arizona? They've chosen us. They've chosen us. Let's go. Yippee. It's all right. You shall ride for me one day, dear Sarah, because I have promised you that, now, haven't I? You'll ride not only for me, but for the greater glory of the sport and for the triumph of the team. And now I'm going to talk to the baby of the team, Sarah Brown, who rides Arizona Pie. Sarah, how do you feel? Well, sort of not here. Of course, riding's in your blood. I think I saw your famous aunt somewhere around. Yes, she's just over there. Everybody knows your aunt is Velvet Brown. I think that's your middle name, too, isn't it? Yes. Well, we know what they called your aunt when she won the Grand National... National Velvet. Maybe we should start calling you International Velvet. It's a bit early for that. Well, the question everybody's asking, are you going to bring back a gold for Britain? We'll try. Yes, we're going to try. I'm sure everyone at home joins with me in wishing you and the rest of the team every success for Britain. Thank you. Thank you very much, Sarah Brown. We shall be covering all the main events live by satellite from the Olympic stadium. In the meantime, this is Joan Parker, news at 10:00. I'll set your hair as soon as I've done this. I haven't forgotten. No panic. What's the matter? Jonathan's announcing the team at 6:00. He told me first, which was nice of him. Does that mean... You're riding. I'm not. Oh, Beth, I'm sorry. Why be sorry? It had to be somebody. As the understudy said, "don't break a leg before the first night." You mean, "do break a leg." No, really, I'm pleased for you. Don't ever feel badly. I'm not crying. Yes, I am. I am crying. Don't take any notice, because it's just reaction. It's nothing to do with you. So don't feel you've got to be nice or say anything. I'll get over it. I just want to get over it on my own. Well, I'll come back and set your hair. Well, you look happy. I am. I am. I've been chosen. They picked me. I'm riding this time. Congratulations. Thank you. Can I buy you a coke to celebrate? Sure, sure. Of course, you realise I shouldn't fraternise with the enemy. I guess thus is a special occasion. Everything's special. Everything's perfect. Careful. For all you know, I might spike your drink. I'm really pleased that you got picked, though. I guess I shall have to root for the British team now. Heh heh. At least one member, anyway. It's you and me this time, not Roger, so no funny stuff. Oh, yes, we're going to be brilliant. And if we aren't, you know what Velvet's going to do to us, don't you? She's gonna wring our necks. Yes, she is. She's gonna wring our necks. I know we'll be good. There isn't any question. Why shouldn't we be? We'll always be the best. Beth? Hello? Mullican 234. Yes. Yes. Darling, it's Sarah. Can you hear me? Hello. Yes, it's a great line. What time is it with you? Oh, I don't know. All I know is it's the night before, and I was just missing you and wishing you were here. Oh, darling, we miss you, too, but we'll be watching. They're showing a lot of it live. That's a laugh. I don't even think I'll be alive. I'm so scared it's not true. Darling, you'll do it. I know you will. Well, I'm gonna try, that's for sure. Here. Talk to John. Cheer her up. She sounds really down. Hello, Brown. How's it going? Listen, you know me. I don't know one end of a horse from the other, but I know you're going to win. I've got money on it. Not too much, I hope. Well, listen, whatever happens, I'll never forget what you both did to get me over here. I love you both. And I love dear old Jack Delacroix, too. Heh heh heh. He's got quite a following over here, which will give you some idea of the company I'm keeping. Some are ok, especially one. I don't have any more change. Bye, darling. Bye. Bye, darling. I'll call you tomorrow. Ah, wilderness. What it is to be young. Oh, heaven. That's what it is... heaven. Heaven, heaven. Yes. I know you're gonna be all right. Just take care of me, ok? Conditions throughout the 3-day event are going to be rough. They're going to be rough on the horses and the riders, and sometimes, of course, they'll be rough on the spectators as well. Heavy rain overnight has delayed the start of the dressage test, and it has made the going very, very heavy indeed. Some of the riders here are bound to find it difficult to complete the course with the sort of finesse and control that's necessary for high placings. Wouldn't you agree with that, Charlie? Yes, it's certainly going to be a day of extra excitement. Only the best are going to survive. We shall be bringing listeners details of individual and team placings as they happen, so stay tuned. P.A.: And next, number 26, Scott Saunders, United States of America. P.A.: Now entering the arena is Scott Saunders, the United States team Captain on the 10-year-old thoroughbred Gettysburg. A nice trot down the centre, and halts to salute the senior judge, Herr Meyer from West Germany. And now to the 20 different movements of the dressage test. Scott Saunders is fancied by a lot of people to be favourite for the individual gold medal here at these Olympics. He's the holder of the pan-American gold medal. He won that last year, and in fact, he's already competed in one Olympic games. We've had some heavy overnight rain, and the going is still a little bit sticky, and as you can see, the horse Gettysburg hasn't really settled at the moment. However, he's better now as he comes into the canter. Not too many mistakes there, and I would've thought that was quite a good test, around the 60, 70 penalty mark. P.A.: Number 86, Ms Sarah Brown, Great Britain. Well, this is the moment we've been waiting for... Young Sarah Brown on Arizona Pie, the youngest member of the British team at the age of 18. Arizona Pie is also the youngest horse in the competition at 8. This is a horse, of course, that competed at Ledyard, ridden then by Roger Peacock, the British team Captain, and this year, fourth at the Babbington horse trials with Sarah Brown on top. And let's hope it's a happy omen for Sarah, because for the first time since we started the 3-day event, the sun has actually come out. Well, about 3 mistakes so far. Otherwise, a fairly accurate test. And Sarah's certainly settled down into the work. Just 3 mistakes, I think, at the moment, and if she can keep this up, she'll be well up in the middle of the order. Well, there's no cause for celebration, is there? On the other hand, postmortems are for the dead. West Germany and the Americans have the edge on us after the dressage obviously, but it's nothing we can't make up if we do well tomorrow. What else... Roger, I want you to go over tomorrow's timings until you know them like the lord's prayer. Yes, sir. I have done, sir. Then say the lord's prayer. Jolly good. P.A.: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome back to Olympic report. This afternoon, we're moving 60 miles away from the main Olympic stadium to see the crucial second day of the equestrian 3-day event, the cross-country speed and endurance. So we join Tony Robson live at Meyerberg. Well, thank you, Brian. Certainly, the action is warming up here. The first member of all the 13 teams competing in the 3-day event have been around the cross-country course, and already there are several problems showing themselves in several of the fences and particularly the gate because we've had heavy overnight rain here last night. Well, there's Johnny Johnson, the chief d'equipe of the British team, himself an Olympic gold medallist in the Olympic games of 1968. And obviously, he'll be very concerned with the baby member of the team, Sarah Brown. Well, this has often been called the toughest of all the tests devised for horse and rider. In fact, they have to go 20 miles across country, they have to jump 12 steeplechase fences, and at the end of that course, they have to jump 34 really big and solid fences. And one of the horses who'll be jumping for Britain is here... Grey Monarch, the mount of Howard Clark who will be going second. 13 teams then, 4 riders in each team. The best 3 overall scores to count, and just waiting to start now in the box on the cross-country course is Bridget Marney, who'll be going second for Ireland. And just mounting now is Howard Clark himself. And there's a quick look at the American team Captain Scott Saunders. Good luck. You, too. Moment of tension there for young Sarah Brown. And here we go. Bridget Marney on the 10-year-old Concade waiting the countdown, and she's away. For Ireland, the first of the Irish horses is gone extremely well with just one refusal of cross-country. And this is the first of the 34 big fences. Up the hill and down to the Diamonds. And he jumps it well. And into the water and way up the far side. This is halfway around as we look at Australia and Bill Jones. And the Peasant Tree. Leoni of Italy. And a first look at the British team Captain Roger Peacock with Devon Boy going extremely well. Coming now towards the drop fence. And this horse has really settled into his work. And here at the Peasant Tree again another of the competitors from the Argentine, as Roger Peacock comes through the logs and into the water. Second to go for the United States, the only lady on that team is Kathy Thompson riding Tara. And she's well out over the Diamonds. This horse is taking a real pull. And here is Louis Tousseau... Oh, what a brave recovery on Victorine. And Kathy Thompson is still going well, coming through the trees, and over the log into the water. No problems there. Mathias of Belgium. Kathy Thompson over the drop. The United States will be well pleased with this round. Irish Mood. Italy. Oh, right off the plate. At 60 for Paul Leher. And this is Switzerland's Kurt Muller. Wolfgang Stein, the German team Captain taking the parallel rails very well. Here he goes the hard way on the "V" and saves time, but stop there. My word, that's an upset for the Germans. And a second one. One more, and he's out. He really does give him... But this time I think he's gonna jump... no. And Germany are really pushed. That's one member of their team out of it. And now waiting at the start is Scott Saunders on Gettysburg... The American team Captain. The United States the firm favourites this year, very difficult to beat. And so far they've got all their horses round. At the Diamond. No problems so far. But there is a problem, and that's a refusal. Well, that's 20 penalties for that refusal, and that, of course, is going to help us. And that must have shaken up Scott Saunders considerably, but he's now got back into his stride, and he's going well. And I can see Roger Peacock coming back, leading his horse. What's happened, Brian? Well, I understand that he fell at the Brush fence. That's the third horse to fall there, and I'm afraid that fence is becoming a bit of a bogey. Well, I'm afraid that horse is lame as well. Well, that means that young Sarah Brown, waiting anxiously in the wings, has got to finish if Great Britain's gonna be in with a team chance. One hitch. I just heard that Roger may not finish. I'm waiting for details. So, if it's true, you must get round. Go out there and prove how wrong I was at Ledyard. All right? Good luck. Do your best. And here's Muller of Switzerland going well at the bogey fence, number 20. P.A.: 10 seconds... And a real tense moment here for young Sarah Brown, the baby of the British team. All the hopes of Britain are on her shoulders as she waits to start. P.A.: 3... 2... 1... go. And she's away. And coming up the hill towards the first of those 34 solid fences, 5 miles of cross-country for young Sarah Brown, and she really must be conscious of all the pressures on her. She's got to finish. And certainly she's going great guns. Look at that. But still a long, long way to go. The Diamonds. And Arizona Pie certainly gave that plenty of room... As he comes to the water. And this is a very fast time, certainly one of the fastest times so far. Looking at our watches, she's well inside the time. Passed the rails, and no problem there. And out over the sunken road. And finishing strongly is Scott Saunders, despite that refusal, for the United States. But meanwhile, back on the course, here's young Sarah still maintaining a very fast pace. Down the hill now, two third's of the way round the course, coming up to the bogey fence, number 20. Oh, she's down. Oh, my word, what a nasty shock for Britain, and she looks as if she's injured herself there. Somebody, thank goodness, has caught the horse. It looks like her shoulder, and if she doesn't finish, that's Britain out of it. And as well as the penalty points for the fall, time is ticking away. They've got to get her back in the saddle. I'm afraid I'm right. That shoulder is obviously giving her some trouble, but she's turning back now. She's giving that horse plenty of room to get at the fence. Coming into it now. And she's jumped it, but she's got to get round without any more penalties. Just that final moment now as she has to take the saddle off herself, and go up to the scales to weigh in. Weigh-in, incidentally, a minimum of 165 pounds. Be dreadful if she didn't make the weight now. No, she's all right. You all right? Get back. All right, go and get David. All right, just cover her. Watch the shoulder. It's all right. It's gonna be all right. All right. Hold on. It's going to be all right. Well done. It's all right. It's all right. It's gonna be all right. David, how bad is it? Well, there's no facture. Dislocated shoulder. Too early to say, really. I'll take another look at it tomorrow. How did we do? Not bad, not bad at all. You were terrific. Great piece of riding. And Arizona? How's he? Nothing to worry about. Just a few scratches. Take care. Oh, darling, it's Velvet. Are you all right? Yes, I just came off and hurt my shoulder. Nothing's broken, is it? No, nothing's broken. Well, now, look, darling, be sensible. You... you mustn't ride if it's at all dangerous. Nothing's worth that. If I don't ride, the whole team will be eliminated. Promise me. Don't worry. I'm not gonna do anything stupid. Oh, darling, of course we worry. Look, all I'm saying is be careful. Please give all my love to John. Big kiss for yourself. Bye. Ok, bye-bye. She's all right. You should be a wrestler. I'm putting you on. Nothing seriously wrong. It was real nice of you to come around. You get some rest now. You had a great ride today. I got lucky. So, I'll see you in the stadium tomorrow, and, win or lose, I'll take you to dinner. Is that a date? That's a date. Good night. Night. Bad luck on them. I want to ride. It would be different if you had to talk me into it. He agrees with me. What? What did he say? Look, Sarah... Well, I know I can't win the medal for me. I know that. But the team still has a chance... No. No, listen. Let me go in and take the first jump, and it'll either work, or it won't, and it doesn't, I'll pull up. Mike, you say something. Sarah, I'm not a doctor. But you want me to ride, don't you? Well, yes, but I don't want you to kill yourself or the horse. Captain Johnson, you're cutting it pretty fine. Yes, I know. You have 5 minutes to make any scratches. Have you decided yet? Tell him. Please, tell him. Tell them... Tell them all 3 members of the British team will be riding. Thank you. Howard and Mike, you jump first. If you both jump good rounds, I'll put Sarah in, but if we haven't got a prayer by the time she's called, I'll scratch her. Understood? Understood. Good luck. Have you all got drinks? And I just have a message from the British tent, and the latest news is that Sarah Brown has been pronounced fit to ride after her fall yesterday in the cross-country. As viewers already know, Roger Peacock, the British team Captain, had to withdraw. Therefore, a lot depends today on the remaining 3 British riders, including the youngest member of the team, Sarah Brown, or International Velvet Brown as she's been dubbed by the press here. That's Bill Connors of the United States on the course, and he's showing that his horse has recovered enough from yesterday's cross-country to be clear at this point. The United States won an Olympic gold in '32, but haven't put it all together since a win in 1948. And that was some good news for the United States, a clear round for Bill Connors, but Bill has some time faults against him. Well, as we've heard, the West Germans have dropped back, and it appears now that the Australians are closing in on the bronze medal. And here's the first British rider, Howard Clark, and he's just about to start his round. As you've seen, very few competitors have escaped time faults, and it's going to be a very tough and very tight contest. Clear at the water, coming toward the wall. And he's over the wall. And... yes, he's through that. To the sixth. And clear again. Well, this is a lovely round for Howard Clark so far. And so far so good now as he approaches the ninth. And he's over the ninth. Well done, Howard Clark. Coming in toward the triple now. This is the one... Yes, he's over the... He's over again. And he's... is he? Yes, he's through. What a marvellous round for Howard Clark on flying scot. Well, that's certainly going to be a marvellous boost for British hopes. Well, now the excitement is really warming up. Here's Hubert Dietrich for Germany. Fence down there. And that's 10 penalty points. Going up the bridge. Well, that's Germany out of it, that's for sure. They won't win a medal. The poles are falling everywhere. And here's Lopez from Mexico in trouble. On the course now, Kathy Thompson of the United States at jump 5. This is the American girl that she was telling us about. Oh, come on, hit something. Good. This is the only event in the Olympic games where men and women compete on equal terms. And here's Mike Lloyd for Great Britain on Wentworth going well. Clear so far. Turns the corner. This is a nasty little stile. But he's well out over that... Oh, I can't watch. Oh, for heaven's sake. He bounced it. It stays. He's clear, yes, he's clear. And that's another clear round for Great Britain. My goodness, we're back in the hunt. Saunders must go clear to keep the pressure on Sarah Brown, the last British rider. P.A.: Number 26, Scott Saunders... And now, America's Captain. Scott Saunders not only wants a clear round, but well within the optimum time. The battle for the gold medal is that close. America just 2 points behind, so Scott Saunders cannot afford to make one mistake. Into the double. This is what the Olympic games are all about. This is real tense stuff. Into the water... And he pops out over that. No problems so far... But he's got to watch his time. It's very, very tight. And up the hill, still going well. That's a very good sort of horse, that Gettysburg. Clear out over the barrels now, and the 10-year-old Gettysburg is still looking good. And round the turn to the last fence, the triple bar. Second part, third part. He's right, and he's clear. The United States team clear, and Britain really have got a fight. Now the moment that viewers in England have been waiting for. For the benefit of those who've just tuned in, Sarah Brown is riding, and that means that the British team are still in there with a real hope for the team medal. Did you ever think we'd be here seeing this, Alice? Now, listen. Don't do it for me. Do it for your father. He won the Grand National, remember? You've got to show him. Ok. P.A.: Number 86, Miss Sarah Brown, Great Britain. For viewers who've just joined us, this is a crucial moment for Britain. Sarah Brown must go clear. You could hear a pin drop now. The double. She's all right. Now turning towards the water. Well out. Oh, god. I feel quite sick. She's clear over that. Halfway round the course. All right for time. Up the bank... And her shoulder must be hurting. Still clear. Oh, beautifully ridden through there. Out over the log pile. Oh, they could... Now, come on, Sarah. Into the triple. One... 2... 3. And that's a clear round for Sarah Brown of Great Britain. No jumping faults, no time faults, and we win. What a wonderful finish for Great Britain. A gold. Yes, a gold medal. She's won. She's won. Oh, I'm so proud. This is a great moment. This is a moment that I don't think she'll ever forget in all her life. This is a great day. At the age of 18, the youngest member of all, and she's done it for Great Britain. P.A.: First, Great Britain: 363.8. Second, the united states of America: 365.8 Third, Australia: 480.3. Well, here you are, Velvet Brown. 40 years old and still drifting. She didn't come home. All she did was send a telegram saying she was getting married. She's won, and she's moved on. Don't tell me you're taking some exercise. No. Just being a messenger boy. This came for you. Special delivery. Oh. What is it? Oh, how do I know, darling? It's addressed to you. Not one of your awful jokes, is it? No. You're sure? What are you looking at me like that for? Why should it be one of my awful jokes? I know you. There's a letter with it. Would you like to read it? No, you read it. "I know there's more to winning "than the prizes. "You've taught me that. "But since you never got to keep yours, I'd like you to have this." "Love always, Sarah." By the way... It was delivered by hand. Hello, Sarah. Scott, I'd like you to meet my parents. Hello. Hello, Scott. Hello, sir. Oh, Sarah. I don't believe it. Come on.
