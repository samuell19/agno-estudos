Nat, look at this. Beer? This pay for it? I got no use for 'em. Ah, for Christ sake, Mike. Give the man a beer. No, thanks. Hey. Come on. No, thanks. Come on. It's paid for. So is this. Okay. Are you a flyer? How long were you in? Did you see any action? How do you think he got all them medals? Washin' the general's car? Where are you headed? Or are you just driftin', like most of 'em? - I'm heading for moonbeam. - Where's that at? That's clean across the state. Hey. I got a farm there. Eh? Or I had one. But, uh, pa had a stroke, and, uh, well, he couldn't work the place no more. You know how it is. Yeah, we know. The goddamn bank took it away from him. Oh, no. Not yet, they didn't. Not if I can get a hold of $100, they won't. How are you gonna do that? Sell them medals of yours? My bike. Yeah. Saw it when you come in. It's a beauty. Yep. Everything on it's special. Made most of her up myself before I joined the escadrille. She's got a double overhead cam, got an aluminum piston, got a spring... I'll let her go for just what I need... a hundred dollars. Might as well be a thousand. Nobody's got a hundred. Sure have a nice machine. Too bad we can't help you out. Well, maybe, uh... Nah. What? Maybe what? Nah. Come on. What were you gonna say? Well, a hundred dollars or a thousand dollars, the same to us, but... Well, maybe there's a way that one of you could get her for, say, five dollars. Now, how's that? What about a raffle? A raffle! Look, you pay the five dollars, a chance to win the bike. I get what I need, and, uh, somebody'll get a hell of a deal. Shoot, for five bucks, I'd watch monkeys do it. - Everybody in that wants in? - Yeah! Let's draw. Okay. Owen hazlett. Oh! That's me! Iwon! I won! I won! Glad I knowed ya! Let's go look at it! Wait'll the kids see this! Oh, it was a lucky day when you came into town! Mr. Hazlett, congratulations. Got yourself a real fine piece of machinery. Oh, I know. Treat her right, she'll do the same for you. Don't you worry, son. I'll take good care of it. Thank you again. My own motorcycle! Whoa! How'd I do? You did fine, Owen. Just fine. I owe you 25 bucks, plus the five you put in. Thirty in all. Okay. Always glad to help a veteran. Giddyap. No vacancies. I'm looking for al barber. He ain't here. Know where he is? He's having breakfast. Bottle of Jack Daniel's. 2.50. "Versailles." Hey, what the hell's goin' on? - You haven't lost your touch, sarge. - I been savin' it for you. - You got any more? - All you can take. Well, you might as well get it out of your system. What the hell you doin' here? I want you with me. Logistics and supply. You set it up, you run it. Just like in the army. You left us hanging out there to get our asses shot off! - I couldn't get through. - You didn't try. I sent you to find out what was happening, and you kept going. You probably was halfway to Paris when the krauts hit us. I ran into a patrol. Where? Chalmette road, a couple miles before the cutoff. I hope you break your neck. Lester's my mechanic. Floyd's working crew. They'd throw in with you after what you did to us? Maybe they know the truth when they hear it. You wouldn't be doing a little penance, would you, Charlie boy? To prove something to your old buddies why you're running this race? Huh? You got anything better to do, al? - That's over 2,000 miles. - 2,126. Well, you can ride clear around the world, and it still won't change what happened! Think of it, ai: $5,000, and a chance to use everything the army taught us riding dispatch. Come on, al. Well, uh, you'll need, uh, spare parts, extra tires... That's your department. Where did you get all that? I sell motorcycles. You be in St. Louis no later than the third. Charlie... We made our way back on chalmette road. There were two things we didn't run into: You and krauts. A man can go crazy living in the past, ai. See you on the third. Lester. Lester Neal. Who's that? Be quiet! Ch... ch... ch-Charlie! I'm gonna throw up a rope. Ch... uh, ch-Charlie s-swattle! Tie it to the bars. Grab it! - Lester. - Uh, uh, g-go away. - Took a lot of trouble finding you. - Yeah? Well, that's tough sh-sh-shit. I'm gonna get you out of here. I don't... I don't want to g-g-go. You're facing two to five for moonshining. Well, I don't... uh, I don't... I don't care, ch-Charlie. I don't believe this. Lester, stop screwing around and grab the goddamn rope! Hey, hey, mister. If Lester don't want to grab the goddamn rope, I sure as hell do. You got it. When those bars come out, you're gonna have exactly six seconds to get your ass out of there, you hear me, Lester? No. No. Lester... Uh, no. As far as I'm concerned, Charlie, you are d... uh, dead! Like you were gonna be when krauts had you pinned down? Except some crazy idiot cut right across the cross-fire with a motorcycle? Huh? Gave you a chance to get out? Ch-Charlie, you... You-you left us out there! Look, if I'd done that, would I be here? Would I be going through all this bullshit? Now, get ready to bail out. Okay? Hey, you. Sheriff. Hey, fatso. What you doin'? You're disturbing the peace with that thing. Goddamn it, you can't ride that thing around here. You son of a bitch, you're under arrest! Try and catch me! Bye, bye. Holyjumpin' Jesus! Lester? Jump! Jailbreak. It's a goddamn jailbreak. Yahoo! Watch out here! I'm free now! Yee-haw! You know, Charlie, I... Oh, I've never seen a bike like this, huh? Well, you never will, Lester. Listen, this is, uh... This is a one of a kind. This is the moonbeam special. "Moonbeam"? Where did you get a name like that? What's wrong with a name like that? It's as good as any, isn't it? Listen, I built it in my old man's barn back in moonbeam, Oklahoma. This is an Indian trans, uh... trans, uh... Uh... uh... gearbox. Uh-huh. And what kind of c... Uh, carburetor is that? I don't know, Charlie. It looks like you've stolen every part known to man, huh? Look, lift the rear end here. Huh? Now, that's high-tensile steel. Twice as strong and light. This primary cover here is aluminum. Back here, cam cover is aluminum. And you've got, uh... Got metal pistons. Double overhead cam. Yeah, I know it. Ch-Charlie... I know. I can see. You and a machine like this, we could... We could go all the way, Lester. Sure could. All the way! Wait. Here. Now, look. I want you to buy a bike. Not, uh... nothing fancy. Doesn't have to be fast. Just tough. Everything you need. Okay. Hey, ch-Charlie, you, uh... you really think that, uh... Uh, we can win? Well, Lester, you never know when lady luck's just gonna walk right up and, huh, drop her drawers? Drop her d-drawers, huh? See you on the third. All right. On the third. Sum... sum-swee-dum, ch-Charlie! How would you like to make $25? Here goes. Grace wolf. I won! That's me! I'm grace wolf! - Don't get too carried away. - I won! You won, Gracie! I won! I won! You won, Gracie! You won! You won, Gracie! Okay. I know. Hey, everybody. Let's go out and take a look at Gracie's motorcycle. Bet I could learn to ride one of these here things. Bet you could. Congratulations, miss wolf. Got yourself a real fine piece of machinery. Treat her right, and she'll do the same for you. Just think, Gracie, you and me, moonlight rides. - Howard... - Gracie! I got orders pilin' up! I'll be right there. Maybe we could take a little spin on it tonight, huh, Howard? In the meantime, you wouldn't mind taking my motorcycle and putting it in your store just for safekeeping? Sure thing. Thanks, Mr. Twattle. Great little girl, ain't she? Uh... We're thinking about getting married. At least, I'm talking. I hope she's listening. Well, good-bye, Mr. Twattle. Hope your pappy's back on his feet real soon. What the hell are you tryin' to pull? Clam chowder, meat loaf surprise... You're not going anywhere on that bike. We had a deal. Shh! Ham, wasn't it? I'll be right with you. That's my motorcycle. Look, I got your 25 bucks right here. Would you keep quiet? Will you slow down? I'm busy. I'm very busy. Miss, please take my order. Yes. What would you like? What the hell you want a motorcycle for? I'll come back when you've decided. Uh, meat loaf surprise. Look, don't you care about that boyfriend of yours? Anything else? You want to see him killed? Wait, I'm not finished with my order yet. Scrambled eggs and bacon. I've seen guys get their backs broke. A side order of potato salad. Side order? Collarbones busted, kidneys ruptured. That's it... A hot-fudge sundae. And they knew what they were doing. Want anything to drink? Look, will you listen to me? I am listening to you. Meat loaf surprise, scrambled eggs and bacon, potato salad, a hot... I got to be in St. Louis in a couple days. Now, be reasonable, will you? My, I thought you were gonna go home and help save your poor, sick daddy's farm. Uh... uh... I got to go to St. Louis first. I got some people meeting me there. They're gonna be very upset if I don't show up. Fudge? Okay, how much. Ninety-seven cents. For the bike. $200. I haven't got $200. And if I did, I wouldn't give it to you. Then start walking. Okay. "Okay" what? 200. I'll send it to you as soon as I get to St. Louis. Your eggs are workin'. Well, then, come with me. You want me to come to you to St. Louis to get it? Five minutes out of town, and you'd unload me. Do I look like that kind of a guy? Sign it. Mm-hmm. It's a bill of sale. Lady, I'm not signing my bike over to anybody. Listen, mister, you haven't got a bike unless you put your Mark right there. And if by the off chance when we're in St. Louis and there isn't all this money you say there is, then I can sell your motorcycle for real. Do you understand? Now, this is the deal right here. There it is. Sign it. Very nice handwriting, Mr. Charles swattle. "Charles," huh? Um, hardware store, 6:30. Just a second. Ninety-seven cents. No tip, huh? - What the hell is that? - Wesley wolf III. Hey, wait a minute. Our deal did not include any goddamn kid. He's my son. And watch your goddamn language. The only excess baggage I'm carrying is you. Fine. I believe St. Louis is that way. Uh... um... Look, how am I supposed to handle two people and a suitcase? I'm sure a person that won all those medals could figure out a way. It's a motorcycle, not a moving Van. Well, Mr. Swattle, which is it? Using a little smarts or... When are we gonna stop? Cut it out! When are we gonna eat? When are we gonna sleep? When are we gonna rest? When we we gonna stop? We have to stop! Why don't you watch where you're going? Mommy! Mommy! You still want to eat? Yes! Then you're gonna have to earn it. I wonder if you could tell me how far it is to, uh, bonner Springs. Seventy, 80 miles. Aah! Ow! Aah! Ow! Aah! Ooh! Ow! I wonder if these here medals will buy us a little food. If you ever touch my son again that way and hurt him, I think I mightjust... Son of a bitch. - What? - A dollar. Somebody put a dollar in it. Who'd do that to a veteran? Why don't you just go out and Rob a bank? At least people would know you was an honest crook. I make those people feel good. By cheating them? By letting them help me. Look, I fought for 'em. I risked my life. Now I'm giving them a chance to thank me for what I did. I don't believe you were in the war, much less the Lafayette escadrille. That's your trouble. You don't believe in anything. You probably stole those medals, didn't you? Oh, yeah? Yeah. You think I got this hanging around the officers' club, throwing darts? I'm sorry. Forget what I said about the medals. - I'd rather forget about the $200. - No. I need that money. What for? None of your business. Uh, will there be anything else, sir? No. Check. Yes, sir. Drink your milk, kid. Oops. Shit! You watered my gas tank. You get an awfully early start, Mr. Swattle. What kind of life is this for a kid anyhow... Hanging on the back of a bike, riding across the country in the wind... You said that you wouldn't unload me. You're a lousy mother, you know that? And you're just lousy! Look, why don't you just go back where you belong and marry Mr. Hardware store what's-his-name... Because I'm still in love with my husband, and he's been dead two years, so it's one-sided. And I'm not gonna stick around that town my whole life serving meat loaf surprise to losers like you! Not any different in St. Louis. The diners are just bigger, that's all. I'm not going to St. Louis for that. I'm going to get my money, and then I'm going on to Chicago! What's in Chicago that's worth $200? Business school. - What? - I said I'm going to business school in Chicago. What's so funny? It's not funny. It's very respectable. There's a lot of women going to them. And when you finish, you can be a secretary in a bank or in an office. Whatever you say. Whatever you say. Yeah, we got a deal, Charlie, and I'm gonna sleep with that goddamn motorcycle if I have to. Watch your goddamn language. Okay, Wesley, let's try it again. All right, now, throw it. Come on. Oh. Hand me that wrench there, will ya, please? Okay, Charlie. Here it is. Thank you. Now, wait a minute here. Know what this is? No. Well, that's something the army gives you for being stupid. Only they call it "brave." You've done some pretty brave things. Riding on my motorcycle and all that. Do you feel brave? Uh-uh. Neither do I. Want it? You're now a member of the Lafayette escadrille. Hey. St. Louis is that way. I got to see an old army buddy. Get ready! Go! Hey! Hey, bevins! Yeah! Some guy wants you on his pit crew. Who? I don't know. I never saw him before. He asked for me? Yeah. Number 23. Hey! Better put in a fresh plug, Floyd. Bad crop out there. Amateurs. Nothing like when you and me were riding the express. But for a $15 purse... Hey, Floyd, wait a minute. Goddamn it, Floyd! Floyd, what the hell? Cantankerous son of a bitch! What the hell, Floyd? That's a hell of a greeting, Floyd! For all you knew, I was iyin' on my back with a kraut bullet in me. Listen, Charlie, you have a bad habit of just leaving people in the middle of things. I got to talk to my army buddy. Now, if you come back to apologize, I ain't gonna... hey! Oh, my god! - He's shooting at Charlie! - Get down, Wesley! Mommy! Mommy! Come on, Floyd. Goddamn it. Come on, now. Floyd, I'm warnin' ya... - Wesley... - Are you all right? - No, I'm not! - Aw, you're all right. You bag of bones. Baby... Hey! Stop that. You'll ruin the bike. What the hell you tryin' to do anyhow? If he's one of your buddies, I'd hate to be around you when you meet somebody that doesn't like you. Floyd's just nervous, that's all. Floyd's nervous? Floyd's crazy. He just tried to kill you. Take ace here and get him a bottle of pop. I'll just be a minute. I'm gonna be real mad if he kills you before I get my $200. You always were a lousy shot, Floyd. Gimme my leg. Relax a minute. Catch up on your reading. Huh? Look at it. I've seen it. Well, I'm in it. Lester's my mechanic, al's working supply. Just like the old days, huh? They got short memories. Maybe they just know the truth when they hear it. I know the truth, Charlie! You ran out on us! You cost me a leg! And I don't ride so good without a leg, Charlie! I sweep up. I work crew. Anything to keep me around what I used to do good! Still got your old bike, Floyd? Have you even fired it up since you've been back? Oh, Floyd. You're living in a pile of shit. You wanna blame me for it, fine. But I'm offering you a chance to find out if everything you ever were or ever wanted to be is in that goddamn leg you lost. You know the one thing that kept me going after they hacked off my leg? You. You're all I thought about. How we'd meet up again, and I'd kill ya. Well, Floyd, the only chance you're gonna get is if you come with me to St. Louis. That's the best reason I can think of for going. Think Wesley's safe in there with Jesse James? Hasn't Floyd passed out yet? Said his cheek was numb. Does that mean anything? Means he's close. Good night, Floyd. What are you gonna do when you get to St. Louis? Try to get to San Francisco just as fast as I can. You sure are restless. Your husband die in the war? Influenza epidemic. - And you can't forget him? - I don't want to. A person can go crazy living in the past. I don't live in the past. I just visit it once in a while. Well, I'd better go find myself some more sleep. How do you feel? Great. You bastard! Hey, there they are! Hey, hey! Motorcycle race. We come all this way for a motorcycle race. Look, uh, I meant to tell you about it last night, but, uh... You were too busy to talk. It was set up before you came along. It isn't just me. How the hell did I know you and the kid were gonna come along? I can't take you with me. What makes you think I want to go with you anyway, Charlie? Thanks for the ride. Charlie! Lester, this grease is coarser than buffalo hockey. It's all right. There's a lot of stuff in it. You know, sarge, uh, bet me five bucks that, uh, you wouldn't show up. I figured the odds were with me. See anyone you know? Uh, everybody. Harry garr, Murphy, Houston. Who's the competition? They're all tough. Watch out for Harry garr. He'll let you get neck-and-neck, then swing an arm out, right across the Adam's apple. Looks like a friendly bunch. 5,000 bucks don't bring out nuns. Let's go check in. Yep. Pop? Hey! By god! I didn't think we'd see you out here, Floyd. Yeah, I'm workin' crew. I'll be doggoned. We missed you. We have sorely missed you. Ol' Floyd here used to ride for me. One of the best too. No kidding? And this is the young man you're going to help to fame and fortune, huh? Charlie swattle. Charlie, Walter Bauer. Everybody just calls me pop. Uh, pop owns the aero-American motorcycle company. Say hello to Calvin hawk. He's one of my riders. Cal. What kind of bike you riding? Moonbeam special. - Come again? - One of a kind. Barn job. You know, this is the age of the factory. There's just nothin' handmade anymore. Guess I'm just behind the times. - Ever been in competition? - Charlie's seen his share of dirt tracks before the war. Seems to me I'd remember a name like swattle. That is, if there's something to remember. Now, Calvin, dad-gum it. Don't you be picking on this boy like that. Just drawing a bead on the competition, pop. The more I see, the happier I get. You want to try it? It'll sharpen your reflexes. Best of luck to you boys, now, Floyd. Charlie, nice to have met you. Good luck, now. Thanks, pop. What do you think? He's an amateur. His bike's a joke. Some folks like a risk. They like the goddamn danger involved. Me, if there's anything in this world I like, it's a sure thing. Don't worry about it, pop. I'm gonna keep the wolves from the door. They're worse than wolves! They're goddamn stockholders! Ol' hawk's gonna make 'em forget all about the red ink that you've been splashing around. You do that, Calvin, any way you have to, or I'll have your balls for breakfast. Hawk! Ha! Yeah, I saw hawk once before. Playa del Rey motordrome. Playa del Rey? Yeah, you been there? Sure, I have. Let me tell you something. He went down on them boards. I thought he was dead. He got up, he was nothin' but blood and splinters. Did he finish? Ha! He won! Not susie. Lucille. That was it. Charlie! Hey, ace. Hey, hey. What you doin'? Ask Charlie. I don't know. He don't know what? Who is this guy? - Got an awful lot of dents. - What's he doin'? Ask, uh, ch-Charlie. Don't know how much she'll need in repairs. Hey, Charlie, what's this guy doin' talkin' about repairs? - Might cost more than it's worth. - Charlie ain't answerin'. All Charlie's great plans for the race, he forgot to mention one thing. Yeah? He don't own the bike. What do you mean, he don't own the bike? Uh, uh, the lady owns the, uh, bike. - What do you mean, the lady... - She's got the bill of sale. - Signed by ch-Charlie. - I couldn't go any higher than $100. What is this? We come all the way to St. Louis to let some dame sell the motorcycle? Did we, Mr. Swattle? Al, is there some way we can handle a couple of passengers? Sure, if they can fit in a can of gas. Well, Mr. Swattle? He back yet? Huh-uh. Well, where'd he go? Didn't, uh, uh, say. Every time that guy's gone more than five minutes, my leg starts to hurt. Which one? The one I ain't got. Eh. He'll be, uh... Ugh... uh, back. That's what you said right before the krauts hit us. Uh, Charlie explained all, uh, that. Said he ran into a p... Uh, a patrol. I'll bet you still hang up your Christmas stockings. If you don't, uh, believe him, why'd you... why'd you come, huh? I ain't made up my mind yet. Mm, yeah? Well, you shouldn't, uh, s... Uh, sit on it all the t-time. You don't like Charlie either, do you? I like him all right. I just don't trust him. - Then why are you here? - Didn't have anything better to do. Oh, that's not much of a reason. Miss grace, I spent 25 years in the army. I was told when to get up, when to go to bed, and what to do in between. When they pensioned me, it used to take me all day to decide what to have for breakfast. By then it was time for supper. I want to ask you something. Why is this race so important to him? Are you his girl? I'm not sure. Don't let it bother you. Nobody's sure with Charlie. Were you in the Lafayette escadrille together? Did he tell you that? Same old Charlie. It's not true? Why, no, miss grace, it's not true. We were dispatch riders, messenger boys on motorcycles. "Lafayette escadrille." Where did you get that wheelchair? Best I could do. "Lafayette escadrille." "Influenza epidemic"? What is that supposed to mean? What is that supposed to mean? Are you saying my husband didn't die of influenza? Are you saying I didn't even have a husband? You're saying I made all this up, aren't you? Well... well, I did. How'd you know? Was it that obvious? If you wanna be a bereaved widow, get yourself a wedding ring. Carry a picture of the lucky stiff. I only thought of it on my way to the hardware store. I had to think of something. His father was a drummer. He was just like you. Only he sold dry goods instead of medals. He stayed around for a couple of weeks. He was talkin' about gettin' married, havin' kids. He did the talkin' and I did the havin'. The kid know? No. He's heard the words, but he doesn't know what they mean. Well, what's wrong with being Mrs. Howard hardware store? I don't love him. Besides, it came time to change things, and you were my chance. Would you really have sold my motorcycle? Would you really have left me here? Time to saddle up, miss grace. See you, uh, Charlie. Ride easy! Ladies and gentlemen, mmmmm the national association of motorcycle racers is proud to announce the beginning... Of the first transcontinental motorcycle race. All right, on your marks. Gentlemen... Fire 'em up! Come on! Come on, get them planks up here. Get them planks up here. Put 'em down right there. That's good. Right there. All right, let's go. Come on. Watch out. Here we go. Hold on. Whee! Watch out for these people. Watch out. Hey. Hey. Here I come. Mornin' to you. Mornin'. Beautiful mornin' it is, too, isn't it? Yep. Can I help ya? Tell you the truth. I could use somethin' cold to drink. I feel like I swallowed about half of Kansas. Sure thing. Here ya go. Hope you do a lot of business today. Thank you. Fill her up! Fill her up quickly! Just in time, Charlie. Just in time. Hell of a place to run a business. Well, well, what do you need, Charlie? Well, fuel, oil, plugs. You got 'em. What's it look like? Shakin' down. The next few miles oughta tell somethin'. Thank you. Hey, ace, come here. What, Charlie? I got a real important mission for you. I want you to go find me some stones about yea big, okay? Okay. How you doin', Charlie? You hungry? Do I smell that bad? I made you somethin' to eat. Why don't you have a sandwich? There's somethin' rattlin' around in there. Now what is it? Huh? I just wanna know what happens when the race is over. We'll be in San Francisco. I'm chasin' you, but I'm not goin' to chase you for the rest of my life. Why not? I needs roots. I need to settle down. Someone to hold on to. So does Wesley. Grace... I know it wasn't part of the deal. I just want to know where I stand. Well, can't we wait? Talk about this after this thing's all over? Will there be anything different to say? Here, Charlie. Let's see. Oh, those are fine. We're comin' up to the desert. Hundreds of miles of sand and heat. And thirst. This is an old Indian trick. You stick a stone under your tongue, you never get thirsty. While all those other guys are stoppin' for water, tryin' to find it, old chief crazy horse will just be ridin' along with a stone... All set, Charlie. Come on, we got a tr-tr-train to catch. Ride easy, crazy horse. Bye. Time, Charlie. Time. We're fightin' time. Come on, hop on. We'll give you a shove. C-Come on. Hop on. Ready? All right, let's go. Shove! Here we go! That's it. Push! All the way to San Francisco. The moonbeam rider! Whee! Hey! You do that again, I'll kick your back behind your ears. Hey! Watch... Shit! God... It's not fair. It's my pitching arm here. Hey, get away from my bike. Hey! The bike. Hey, these yours? Charlie? Hey, hey, that him? By god, good ridin', Calvin. No competition. Who's left? Nobody that really counts. I got two for the price of one. I took out McCall and that, uh, shit-kicker in one shot. Swattle? Calvin, you're a credit to the sport. There's Lawson. We're one and two. There's Jesse right behind him. Just as long as we finish that way. Like I said, no competition. Is that the shit-kicker that you took out? He ought to be part of the scenery by now. Determined son of a bitch, ain't he? Who is that guy? What's the matter? You gettin' worried, Calvin? Hey, I'm not even breathin' hard. Jesus Christ, Charlie, we are fourth! How'd you do it, c-Charlie, huh? Let him rest. Oh, hey, Lester, get... We can do it! We can go all the way! You idiot! Come on, come on! We got a lot of work to do here now. These wheel bearings are shot. How you doin', Charlie? How you doin'? Gotta check the spark plugs. Need some rest? No, I want the wrench for the carburetor. I'll wake you when the bike's ready. Gimme the wrench for that, uh... g-get your own, uh, wrench. Get the tools over here. Check that tread. Okay. And check those wheel lugs. Wh-where's your... Come on, Lester. Stand back! How many things did you bring here? Charlie, Charlie, wake up. Is the bike ready? A man said to give you this. He said he made it special for you. What man? Him. Aren't you goin' to eat it? Later. Ah, where ya goin', Charlie? Gonna stretch my legs. Want some company? You lose your appetite? You made a real good showing out there today. Done a hell of a lot better than most people expected. Were you in the war, son? Well, this race is sort of... Sort of like a war. It's a war of stockholders and dividends. Your company's on its ass. We've had some setbacks. You win the race, your company blooms. You lose and, uh, you fold your tent. You're very perceptive. Look, I'm in the business of selling motorcycles. The only way that I can be sure that I sell a hell of a lot of motorcycles is finish one, two and three. Then that way there's no argument about who's got the best machine. Jesus Christ, there's no disgrace for someone like you finish fourth. - No money either. - What's money compared to your health? It's a long road out there, son. There's a hell of a lot of things can happen on it to you and your crew. How much? I think the figure's $5,000. That was for winning. For losing's, it's more like, uh, 500. I owe my people something. Son, we're born alone, and we die alone. We just keep friends around to take up the time. Besides, be a shame for that boy to grow up without a father. And you could be a damn good one on $500. Be a hell of a lot better on 5,000. My god, you strike a hard bargain, son. Of course, that's the sort of thing that america's built on, wasn't it? I'll put $2,000... On the table free and easy if you come in fourth. It's a lot of money. Sure. Damn it! 1,800, 1,900, $2,000. Quite a little nest egg there, Mr. Swattle. Here's your deposit book, and as a token of our appreciation for opening an account at eagle bank and trust company... You forgot your gift, Mr. Swattle. Excuse me. Pardon me a minute. Mr. Swattle! Mr. Swattle! Mr. Swattle, you forgot your gift! Mr. Swattle! That's Charlie. He's my friend. Well, would you give this to him for me, please? Sure. Good boy. Where is he? Who? Charlie. He, uh, went to stretch his legs. He'll be back. He'll be back, Floyd. Now come on. Now what's eatin' you, huh? See, here he is right now. Hey! Hey, good as new. Good as new. - Get this wheeled over to checkout. - Number one! Hey, come on, Charlie. We've got two minutes to check out. Where are you goin', Floyd? What's your hurry? The train doesn't leave for another hour. Whoo! Where the h-hell is he goin'? Oh, Floyd's got a wild hair up his ass about somethin'. He'll be back. I'll bet my last dollar he's hooked on this race. What the hell are you doin'? Keepin' you honest. I'm ridin' your exhaust all the way to frisco. You'll never make it. I'll make it. I'm not gonna wait around for you. Just ride, you bastard! Ride! Ride! Think you're gonna make it, Floyd? Ride! Ha! Ohh! Ooh! - Hey, Harold, watch it! - Ohh! Shit! Whoa! Whoa! And whoa! End of the line, Floyd. Ah, bullshit. We can't get through this. Nobody can get through this. You'd like that, wouldn't ya? I saw you and pop Bauer come out of that hotel bar. Pop Bauer's a nice fella. Bought me a glass of ice tea. Yeah? What else did he buy, Charlie? That's the trouble with you, Floyd. You don't believe in anything. No, let's go this way. Huh? Come on. There's nothin' over there. Push! Oh, this damn thing's heavy. Well, pathfinder? It's gotta be around here some place. Sure. Come on! Let's go! Throw me a line! Watch that bike now! Be careful. Somebody throw me a line. Get me out of this mud down here! What about my bike? Why do I let you... There it is. Come on, Charlie. You're nuts. You got a better way besides quittin'? You gave us somethin', Charlie. Now you ain't takin' it back, not without a fight. Kiss your kidneys good-bye. Why you stoppin', Charlie? Suddenly I feel like walkin'... If it's okay with you. Yeah. Run! Charlie! What? Pull the damn thing! I am tryin'! Clear the tracks! Oh, shit! Charlie! Ch-Charlie? Charlie! Charlie! What'd you do with your other leg? You look like a goddamn flamingo. Where is my spare leg? Hey, Charlie! Floyd! How are you guys doin'? Um, wh-where ya been? Where do we stand? Maybe, uh, uh, uh, n-not good. Hey, Lester, you should have seen him. He practically carried me on his back. If it hadn't been for Charlie, I'd be spread halfway to Denver by now. Where is everybody? Uh, uh, uh, gone. Where? Well, uh, ai took, uh, grace and the, uh, kid to the train station. Well, why? Beats the hell out... out of me. Did she say anything? Yeah, she, uh, said she didn't want, uh, Wesley to have anything, uh, to do with that. Wait, just... You know, uh, Charlie... Charlie, wait, wait! Charlie, we gotta... Lester, get over here! Goddamn it, he's doin' it again! W-What? He's runnin' out on us! No, wait... I'll... Stop it! Stay away from me! I don't want to talk to you! Let me explain. I wouldn't believe anything you say. Listen, damn it, listen. - Hey, you're goin' the wrong way. - So are you. Get out. No. I want to talk to ya. Go to hell! Charlie, take it easy. You son of a bitch! Let me alone! No! No, I don't wanna talk to you. No. Let go of me. Let go of me! Where you goin'? Damn it. Where the hell do you think you're going? Away. Why? You know why, you son of a bitch. You sold out to pop Bauer. You sold us all out to pop Bauer. How could you do it? I came all this way believing you wanted to win this race. They all believed ya. But you don't want to win this race. Because you're a quitter. You're a lousy quitter. I hate you for doing this. I hate you! Be honest about it, Charlie. Or can't ya? You've been lying so long and so hard about the war, about your father, about this race. Why don't you tell me the truth? You owe it to me! The truth is, I won those medals in a crap game. God... damn it! The truth is I never tried to get back to the unit. I saw those krauts, and I froze with my face in the mud. I was afraid of gettin' hit. God... Now look, pop Bauer wants this race. He needs this race. This isn't a goddamn kids' game, it's a war. That's what he called it. In a war, you win by crippling the enemy's supply line. That's you, Floyd. Al, Lester. It's you, honey. You took his money. You went and opened an account in a bank. All that money bought... Is a chance... For me to win this race. Charlie! Charlie! Hey, it's all over, kid. You know what? Uh, what he said, uh, made sense. Charlie always makes sense. He just never tells the truth. Al? Well, what's the truth got to do with the price of potatoes? Come on, Lester. Hey, what are you doin'? We're goin' to San Francisco. Why, you're nuts! Charlie ain't gonna show! Well, we'll never know unless we're there, Floyd. You know what? You're going to be waitin' at that finish line with your thumb up your nose waitin' for him, just like you did in France! Well, you got anythin' better to do? Huh? Hey! Hey, move over! Down, down, down! Let's land in front. Hey, you guys, all of ya, come here. I've got a young son of a bitch I want you to take out for me. I don't care how you do it, but take him out. Understand? Uh-huh. He's up on bear creek road. He's comin'. Now! - Where's my gun? - Get him! Shoot him! God-darn it! He's gettin' away! - Look out! Look out! - Hey! Hey! Motorcycle! Hey, what... Wow! I'll be. Let's get out of here! Oh, you shit! Who in the hell is that guy? Hey, stop! Stop! Stop! All right! Yeah! That a boy! I never doubted you for a minute, Charlie. What are you talkin' about? In the name of sportsmanship and fair play, it gives me extreme pleasure to present this trophy to the winner of the first transcontinental motorcycle race. Along with this check for $5,000. Yeah, Charlie! Money, yeah! Yeah! Grab a hold of that money, Charlie! We did it! Charlie! Charlie! Did we win, Charlie? You bet your goddamn ass we did, ace. Watch your goddamn language. I wasn't sure you were gonna show up. That's the trouble with you, Charlie. You don't believe in anything. Swattle. Charlie, you owe me $2,000. Now, pop, this may be the first transcontinental motor race, but it's not gonna be the last. Listen, that $2,000 bought you a winnin' crew. That's a winnin' crew. Boy, you gonna bleed for this. Pop, you and me got a great future together. Maybe. Look at it. The aero-American motorcycle and sidecar company presents... The moonbeam special. Huh? It might work. Listen, pop, I don't want there to be any hard feelings. General black Jack pershing... Pinned that on me. Hold it, everybody. Hold it. Picture. Let's gather around. Love, love, love, pictures. Pictures. Uh... Okay. Everybody look here.
