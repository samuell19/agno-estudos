(tribal drum music) (light dramatic music) (motorcycle rumbling) (motorcycle rumbling) (car engine rumbling) Lucifer, pass anybody? - No, you? - No. Got the bucks? - Easy kid. Exactly what am I paying $4,000 for? 2,000 caps, 400 megs psilocybin. You call me kid again, I'm gonna kick your balls up around your ears. (Lucifer chuckling) Take a taste, you know what you're gettin'. (wind whistling) - Oh, baby. - Get the bucks. (Cloud whistling) (suspenseful violin music) [Lucifer] Better ditch that stuff quick, man. Take it easy, take it easy. Still wanna deal? [Lucifer] You got somethin' to deal? - Remember Cloud? - Sure. Know his place in the desert? Okay, tonight at 10:00. Count how many times your phone rings. We'll meet you there that many days from now. Okay, cool. (motorcycles rumbling) (retro rock music) I hope this works, man. Make it good, man. I'll get Monk and Juice and see you at Cloud's in three days. (motorcycles rumbling) [Dispatcher] Move in, unit two. Cut him off! (tires screeching) (sirens wailing) (retro rock music) (water splashing) (car engine sputtering) Nasty break, fuzz!

[Crab] Hey man, look it here. This must be a, rollin' hippie motel. Wee! (bikers laughing) (motorcycles rumbling) (playing cards rustling) Nope, it's not the plugs. Well, jeez, I could've sworn it was them plugs. I mean, I already- - Screw his plugs man, gimme half a buck's worth of gas. - Regular? - Regular? Regular makes my engine ping. I don't want my engine to ping. This is a precision machine. It burns only the finest fuel. Can you dig it, man? - Yes, sir. - Well then do it! [Magic] Get him, Brain (chuckling). (motorcycles rumbling) Welcome, brothers. Hey, lemme caution you. This gentleman here may attempt to foul up your fine machinery with his regular gas. Regular? Regular! Didn't they teach you nothin' about chopper requirements at gas station school, sonny? Why a guy could get his pump busted makin' a mistake like that. Where's your Coke machine, junior? [Attendant] Over there. Angels, huh? Yeah, I've known a few. Fine gentlemen. Here you go, dude. As you probably noticed, we're Dragons. My compatriot here is Magic, and they call me Brain. Long John, I'm Monk and the Coke freak is Juicer. You boys are a long way from home. So are you, man. Like where are you headed? - South. - South? South, what about you? We're hangin' out not far from here. Guess there's some lovely hippie-type people that we stumbled on. We've been there since yesterday and it looks like we're gonna have a few more days of fun and games before we move on. It's gonna be a party, man. There's gonna be wine, women, weed. Right, I got a few extra cases of Rocky Mountain Kool-Aid. Hey, listen man, could we interest you into joining us? I mean that's if you could take time off from your journeys south. Hey Long, what say we go, man? We got the time, man. Let's do it. (twangy rock music) (biker laughing) [Biker] Come on, General. Come on, man. Come on, General. Come on! (motorcycles rumbling) - All right. - All right, all right! (motorcycle revving) (muffled shouting) - (chuckling) Right on! - Oh, right on. Mm. (Clean Sheila chuckling) All right! Wait. Some good crystals, man (chuckling). Oh, right on. (all laughing) (mumbles) Clean Sheila, you keep mixin' 'em up like this and pretty soon you're gonna be blowin' minds at the White House, for the big press. That was a nice go, Axe, eh? But not nice enough. Who's numero uno, Axe, hm? Who's number one? C'mon, man, say it. Who's numero uno? (General cackling) (motorcycles rumbling) General, I've invited these brother road rats along to join us for the evening's festivities. Well you did right, Brain. Nice. That's a fast lookin' scooter you got there. Yeah, well, fast enough. (General chuckling) - Yeah? - Yeah. Wanna see how fast? Sure, why not? (bikers chuckling) Okay. (motorcycle rumbling) Show him where it's at, man! All right, let's get it on. - That's right, Gen! - Come on! (bikers shouting over each other) [Biker] Show 'em you're a real racer! Okay, one, two, three! (retro rock music) - Yes, dude! - Come on, John. Show him how we go, come on! Come on, baby! (motorcycles rumbling) (tires screeching) Come on, General! Come on, General! (indistinct shouting) Goddamn! Ah, shit! [Juicer] We're called the Dragon Slayers, man. (Juicer chuckling) - There you go. Lay it on me, man. You really done it. - Aha, yeah! You really showed some class. - Bitch. - He couldn't move it. Just had these goddamn things cleaned! - What's the matter? - Beer? I don't want a fuckin' beer now, man. (Monk chuckling) Bitch. - You really tore it up. - Hey, yo. Yeah (chuckles). We're gonna do this again later. And the next time we'll do it right. Anytime (chuckles). - Oh, have a drink, man. - C'mon man. Let's dig the town. - Right here, I hear you. - Let's dig the town. Dig it, man. Look, is it me or is that man just a little bit weird? Yeah, you're right. That dude is ready for the hat factory. Hey, guys. Trip to the moon (giggling)? (romantic guitar music) Thanks, babe, how 'bout one more? Man, I've got enough here to launch the seventh fleet. C'mon, honey, I'll show you why they call me the horny angel. (Monk chuckling) Later, Monk. [Monk] Oh, yeah, yeah. (Lynn chuckles) Wow, that's really funny. Hey, how come everybody calls you Crab? Here. Oh, shit and I thought you were a Cancer. (Crab burping) (soft romantic music) [Long John] Which one's me? I don't know, I haven't decided yet. I could make you anyone I want. Yeah, well I ain't anyone. I'm me. Who's me? Who the fuck are you? Astrid. Long John. I don't recognize you. I thought I'd seen all of you since yesterday. Yeah, this ain't our party. We're just passin' through. What about you? You live out here (chuckling)? Yeah, I live out here. Is there something wrong with that? Don't get uptight, babe. You gotta admit it's pretty freaky livin' out here in the middle of nowhere in a stinking ghost town. Freaky? Big bikes and heavy boots and chain belts. Don't you think that's freaky? Yeah. Can I ask you somethin' without you getting uptight? Yeah, sure, why not, babe? Why do you guys... Why do you do the things that you do? The things we do. Oh, the things we do. You mean like cop stompin', baby rapin', town burnin', shit like that? You tell me why you hippies are always chuckin' acid in the reservoir and bowlin' in the parks and burnin' people in their living rooms. Okay, okay. You ride a bike and you're guilty. I wear beads and I'm guilty. But what I'm talking about with you guys, it's something more than that. Like what about Altamont? There was a guy killed there. Shit, I've never been at Altamont. What about you? You with them hippie chicks that chopped up all them Hollywood dudes in LA? Oh, look, I don't even think we're talking about the same thing. What I don't understand, what I'm asking about is why all of the violence? (woman laughing) (biker whistling) I ride where I want, I wear what I want, and get stoned when I want. How long do you think I could make it like that? Any citizen come along and think he could fuck with me? Yeah, yeah, I dig your problem. But I just don't think your solution is right. Shit, what works is what's right. (motorcycle rumbling) (indistinct shouting) All right, Crab, I'm, gonna open it for ya. Hey, man, what? Hey, man, you mashed my beer can! (soft romantic music) Lost Cause. The guy that named the place must've been a prophet. See? Cultural coexistence. Yeah, but I don't think that's gonna happen again. Our answer to the Eiffel Tower. [Long John] Shit, looks like a sluice to me. - Well here it is. - Hey, everyone. [Astrid] This is our home. Vicki, this is Long John. Hi. How do you like it? Oh, wow, that's beautiful. [Long John] Right on. Well, every day it'll get better. In how many days? I guess that depends on what you want, man. Boy, are you heavy. Do you really have to come on so strong? Don't you ever back off? (motorcycles rumbling) Hey, dig it, Brain. If that's what you get for goin' to church, I oughta go more regular. General's joking. He goes to church often. It's his main source of pocket money. (General cackling) Oh, Brain, you're a riot. One of these days I'm gonna cut your heart out. (motorcycles rumbling) (eerie music) What's this 13 for? - You puttin' me on? - No. What's the 13th letter in the alphabet? M. What starts with M? Mother. (Long John chuckles) Misfit? Milkshake? Marijuana? Oh, shit, you're smarter than you look. Just like kids playing soldier. What are you playin' at? - Hi. - Hi. Well, I don't know how you feel, but I'm gonna be really glad when these guys split. [Astrid] Oh, I'll be as glad as you. [Vicki] Hey I saw you walking with that guy, Big John or? Long John. Where's his head at? I dunno. I don't think he knows either. I'm really surprised, I thought you were you know, kind of digging him. Yeah, I kinda dig him, but it's like the way I dig stray dogs. (retro rock music) (motorcycle rumbling) (tires screeching) [Biker] Hey, did you come to tap on the goat? I mean, where'd you get that piece of garbage? Hey, what's happenin, man? I thought the boy- - Hey, man, where's Long? Where's Juice? (bikers laughs) Hey! Hey, what's happenin'? - Three days at Cloud's. Goddamn, when's that Lucifer comin'? Who put all this garbage in my yard? What all this junk doin' here? This no junk yard, this Cloud yard. - Oh man, keep it cool. - Woo! Come on in, Cloud better roll you some dinner. - All right. - All right, Cloud. [Jagger] Yeah, look at the place, man. This is home. You look like you died somewhere last week. - Woo! - Woo! - Nice goat. - Woo! - Yeah! - You look like you some kind of bad accident. (nose snorting) Aw, beautiful. (retro blues music) - Where's the line, man? - Beat it! [Monk] You pissed on me, man. You pissed on my boots. You drunken asshole, what do you mean pissin' on my boots? You blind, drunk asshole, you! (bikers yelling over each other) (motorcycle rumbling) On your mark! All right. Guzzle! [Axe] Come on Louie, baby. [General] Get up, you son of a bitch. Get up, I got 40 cents ridin' on you. Get up! - Fuck off, you lose. Well, like, how do you feel when you're riding? Well, honey, when it's winter, I feel cold. When it's summer, I feel hot. And when it's raining, I feel wet. No, no, I mean like, you know how do you feel inside? (Monk chuckles) Now, you want me to run out all that fairytale shit, don't you? About feelin' free in the wind and all like that. Well, no, no, I'm talking about stimulation. Look, you've got all this power, right? And you've got all this force, and then you've got this machine between your legs. - Oh. - And you're just... My machine. Right on. - My machine. - Yeah. Hey, where's your fast friend? You say somethin', man? I said, where's your fast friend? Hang in there a second, honey. I like where we're goin'. What you want him for? What are you, his secretary or somethin'? Hey, man, I'm a lotta things, and right now I'm curious. Relax, I just wanna run. Why Long John? Let's just say I wanna bring home the trophy. Oh, well in that case he's right over there. You know, I don't even wanna go for a ride anymore. You'll wanna go for a ride. Feel like another run? - Who and where? - Me and now. [Long John] Where to? Let's make it interesting. Up to the end of the road and back twice. [Long John] Right. Come on, man, let's show 'em what you got! Come on! (motorcycles rumbling) Go, baby! - Come on, boy, you got it. - God almighty, Louie. Come on, get it together! - All right. - Just do it. We got one, two, three! (motorcycles roaring) (bikers whistling) (retro rock music) (bikers shouting over each other) No, no! Come on! (bikers whistling) (bikers cheering) No! No, let go of me! No, help! [Biker] Yeah, come on! (bikers whistling) - He's late! (motorcycles rumbling) [Biker] Woo hoo! Woo hoo! He's nothin', man, you coulda beat him, man! - No shot, man. - Where is she? Where's the chick, huh? (Astrid screaming) [Astrid] You pigs, let go of me! No! - Bitch, get your ass- Church, man, she went to Church with the General. Ah, forget the chick, man. Hey, get her back. Oh, shit, now we're gonna... (retro rock music) (Astrid screaming) (Astrid crying) Let go of me, you, bastard. Let go! (furniture crashing) What the hell is goin' on here? [Astrid] No, please. (fists thudding) (men groaning) (wood snapping) (ominous music) (Astrid screaming) (man groaning) (body thudding) (fists smacking) (men grunting) You stupid sons of bitches! You freaked out! Freak! You laid all this down for a hump? You couldn't wait your turn. (somber orchestral music) She's dead. She's dead, man. Holy shit, General! I thought I'd know where these guys were at, man. I never figured they'd lose their cool like this. - She's dead. - That's right man. She's dead! [Long John] What are you sayin', man? Why would I kill her? Why? Maybe you weren't aimin' for the chick, huh? Maybe you wanted to call the guy that was doin' her, huh? Dig? You got lost in the dark. Snake! She took it for me! You guys tried to stick the General? (General grumbles) Well you blew it, boys. You blew it. Pay. Oh, yes sirree, you are gonna pay. Take 'em down to the jail cell. You boys better start thinkin' about your sins tonight 'cause tomorrow, you start payin' dues. - Really? - Really, man. Some guys ain't got no class! Hey, hey Long. Hey, I got blood all over me, man. Look at it, man. Where'd it come from? Come from your nose, your mouth, every place you caught one. Oh, but I, but I dropped a lotta stuff last night. I think maybe that- - Forget it, Juice. It's your blood. - Why? - Huh? Why does it have to be his blood? [Long John] All right, man, whose is it? Look, Long, Juicer said it himself. He dropped a lotta acid last night, man. Now, I don't know, but- Yeah, well I know. You don't carry a blade. Juice don't carry a blade. I don't carry a blade, right? So, ain't nobody here knifed that chick, okay? (ax banging) (indistinct yelling) Order! Order! (bikers talking over each other) Everybody off their asses for the judge. (bikers cheering) (bikers whistling) - Woo hoo! - What's happenin', General? (bikers cheering over each other) Settle down! (bikers whistling) (bikers cheering) (bikers laughing) (bikers whistling) - Dammit, stop! This trial is gonna be orderly. I want plenty of... I want plenty of... Brain? - Decorum, Your Honor. That's right. Plenty of decorum. Like with Perry Mason, right? You understand? (indistinct talking) And to see that I get it, Axe here is gonna act as my sergeant-at-arms. Step outta line and he'll be all over you. Okay, Mr. Persecutor, are you ready? Yes, Your Honor, the prosecution is ready. (General chuckling) Mr. Defense. Well, now your judgeship, we- Right, everybody's ready! (General groaning) Okay bring 'em in. (door creaking) (bikers shouting over each other) - I hate you! - Pussy ass piece of shit. (bikers shouting over each other) Now, you boys relax, man. Old Magic here has got a couple tricks up his sleeve. You know? (Magic laughing) Beautiful. Now, the charges. Look, you guys were invited here by us. Dragons, you was our guests. You drank our wine, you smoked our weed. We treated you like, like brother outlaws should. So, what happened? You hassled us. You messed this up. You busted up our party. You spoiled our train. You tried to burn me! And you snuffed out my new mama! That's bullshit. (fists thudding) (Monk groaning) Sorry 'bout that, General. We resume. Brain, now, what happens? Your Honor, according to legal procedures, the defenders now enter their plea. Your Judgeship, my boys here plead guiltier than Hell. Guilty? Good, just what I figured. Brain, what's the persecution got to say? The Dragons' case is a simple one. We all know the facts. This Long John here had horns for the dead hippie chick. While we were turning her up last night, he freaked. With the help of Angels' Monk and Juicer, he tried to assassinate the General. But they blew it, they killed the chick instead. There rest the Dragons' case. Straight up and straight down. (crowd cheering) (crowd applauding) All right, all right.. All right, all right, settle down! - Silence! - Settle down. General, I got somethin' to say. I know I ain't part of this deal, but this is ridiculous, man. Someone's already been hurt- Shut up, you! Axe if he opens his mouth again, chop his tongue off! General, look- Axe. (Henry scoffs) (instinct talking) Jury, you heard enough? Sure, General, we heard enough. What's the verdict? Magic already said it, guiltier than Hell. We say lay it on 'em. Good. Justice will be done. If you got anything to say, you better run it out now. General, I can't figure out what trip you guys are on. I mean, you say we tried to snuff you, and got the chick instead. Man, that don't make any fuckin' sense. All I did was bust your train. From where I was, it was my piece of ass she was pullin'. That blade could've been for me or Monk or Juice. Point is you don't know who killed the chick. I don't know who killed her, so what's this whole fuckin' number about, man? We got enough hassles from the heat and the other citizens, why bum trip each other? Look all we wanna do is just get on our hogs, and meet our club and just drop all this shit. (General chuckling) (General applauding) Very smooth. Ain't that smooth, boys? (biker chuckling) - He's smooth all right. Look you may be able to hype some fools with that smooth talk, but this time you messed up, man. And you've been found out. Smooth mouth type. That's right, General. You may be crazy, babe, but you ain't stupid. Cool it, Magic! I wanna hear it. Brain says assassination, he was right. You was a target, you still are, man. He said we got plenty of reason to snuff you. What about Axe, huh? You think he wants to lick your ass? Well, what about, what about Brain? You think he digs takin' orders from some stinkin' little turd? You trying to lay some paranoia on us, shit head? You got the wrong club. If we didn't love the General, we wouldn't ride with him. That's right, Brain, you tell 'em! These guys love me! And that's enough outta you and this trial is over, and you're guilty! I sentence you three to a round of games on the Dragon playground. (bikers cheering) - Let's play! (bikers yelling over each other) Well, that sure didn't work out like I figured. - Fun and games. - Yeah, only game we're playin' is gettin' the hell outta here. That's right, man. Monk, you know where we are? Yeah, man, I got a rough idea, I don't know. You, Juice? Geography ain't my thing, man. I know we're in California. - Here. And maybe a desert, I dunno. Okay, okay, okay, look, we're here. Gas station we first met these assholes is 18, 20 miles up this dirt road. Which means San Loupe oughta be about 50 miles south, straight through the desert. Now, what does San Loupe do for us now? Cloud's place is on a San Loupe road about four miles outside of town. Which means we get our hands on a couple of chops, we can either go back up that road the Dragons know better than we do, or we can cut straight south through the desert. Ain't nobody gonna wanna follow us. Hey, Long, how do we know when we're goin' south? Okay, um. Keep the sun over your right shoulder, all right? As long as you got a look over your right shoulder and see the sun, you'll be cool. Well, what do you do when the sun goes down? Worry about that when it happens. You better hope the hogs that we grab got full tanks, man. [Long John] They do or they don't, man. Ain't much choice. Want me to go for the scooters? The first chance we get. All right. (ominous music) I don't think you boys have seen this town right. (Long John spitting) (Monk groaning) (Juicer gagging) Think I'll show it to you my way. Don't get any wise ideas. Just wait. (funky rock music) (motorcycles rumbling) Okay, boys, give 'em the tour. (funky rock music continues) (Monk shouting) (bikers shouting) (Monk groaning) (motorcycles rumbling) (bikers cheering) (Monk groaning) (fists thudding) (Monk groaning) - Come on, come on! - Get outta here! Move! (motorcycles rumbling) - You boys look a little- - Oh, well, well, well. Hey, you boys look a little dusty. (bikers laughing) Give 'em some water. - No room here, brother. [General] Aw, I'd sure hate for you boys to fade so early in the game. - Right on. You gotta help us get outta here. Hell, man, they got the rotor to our van. Here, drink this. Cut the rap, and give 'em the water, and get the hell outta there! - Yeah. - Let's go, let's go. - Get outta here. - What's going on? (woman laughing) (bikers laughing) (soft rock music) Two fucking days. No Long, no Lucifer. Ain't that beautiful? Don't sweat, Rings, they'll be along anytime. Oh, don't sweat, my ass. What if they got busted? - Yeah. Hey man, you're losin' your cool. Even if they was to get busted, why would they drop a dime on us? Okay, okay, nobody got busted. They're all makin' it here right now. But they did have Lucifer staked out and maybe they had an ear on his hook. Dig, Long said three days and that's tomorrow. I split tomorrow, bread or no bread. Right on. Brain? The teams ready? Ready and waitin', General. Good, then let's get the boys out on the field so we can play some chopper polo. (motorcycles rumbling) (whistle blowing) Okay, okay, here we go boys. I'm gonna give you the rules now. Here are the teams, with their mounts and mallets. And these are the goals. (biker whistling) Axe will defend the desert goal and I will defend Lost Cause goal. You guys are the balls. Now, the team that gets two of you across their goal, wins the game! You dig? Okay you ready, Axe? - Yeah, I'm ready. (motorcycles rumbling) (indistinct shouting) (biker whistling) (whistle blowing) (bikers shouting) (psychedelic music) (motorcycles rumbling) [Long John] How about to your right! Goddammit, haul ass! (indistinct yelling) (motorcycles rumbling) (Monk groaning) (indistinct yelling) (motorcycles rumbling) (Juicer groaning) [Biker] Woo hoo! (motorcycles rumbling) Okay Juice, this is it man. Go to your left, go to your left! Man, come on, haul ass, go! Take off, man! Go, go, go! (Juicer groaning) (biker groaning) (fist thudding) (biker groaning) Monk! - What? Come on, man! Come on! Come on! Come on, come on, come on! Gimme your hand, gimme your hand, gimme your hand! (motorcycle rumbling) That's it! Dude, grab the bike, head for the desert. I'll get Juice. (bikers cheering) (motorcycles rumbling) (body thudding) (whistle blowing) Get him, over here! (motorcycles rumbling) Go ahead, you stupid bastard! Have fun! Hey, you forgot your canteen! How 'bout a little peanut butter sandwich for the road? Hey, General, ain't we goin' after 'em? Don't have to, man. That scooter's only got a half a tank of gas. That dude's gonna be double black by night. (motorcycle rumbling) (soft somber music) - This didn't have to happen. - You're right. Henry, we gotta get that rotor back. Matter of fact, the group moved in, we should've moved out. Yeah. I'm gonna go see the General. Oh, yeah. Yeah, that mother's gonna look a lot better on my chopper. Louie after you finish pickin' that scooter clean, I want you to get some rope. Follow it to the top of the sluice. - The sluice? - Yeah, the sluice. I'm building a kinda rollercoaster. A rollercoaster? Outta sight, man. Well don't get your hopes up, stupid. It ain't gonna be no joyride. It's kind of a goodbye present for our guests. - General? - Yeah, what do you want? Well, after what's gone down, I think it's best we leave. Oh, I dig you want your rotor back. Right. Well, look man, I'll tell you what. What's your name? - Henry. - Henry, right. Well look, Henry, you're gonna get your rotor back, tomorrow just before we split. We're gettin' everything together now. Tomorrow mornin' we kiss off these freaks, give ya back your rotor and split. Look Henry, I hope that's good enough for ya 'cause that's exactly the way it's gonna be. - Now listen, man, we're- - No, dig this, Mr. hippie-ass Henry! I wasn't askin' ya, I was tellin' ya. You ain't goin' nowhere until I say so. Look, Henry, why don't you go and string some beads or pick some flowers, man? You know, like do your thing? Look, Henry, can't you be groovy, man? Don't you understand that once a blood starts- Why, you stupid mother! Look, Henry, if I feel like drownin' this town and all you creeps in it in blood, I'll do it. (motorcycle rumbling) Lemme see, lemme see. There, I ain't no Ben Casey, but that'll hold you for a while. Hey, hey, you see ole Monk grab that chopper, man? He really showed some class. They couldn't touch him. He sure had it screwed on. Better keep it that way. (motorcycle rumbling) Shit! (psychedelic music) (dune buggy roaring) Hey! Hey, hey! Hey, look! Hey, wait! Hey, look it, come back! Hey, look here, man. Hey, hey! Come over here! Hey, man, wait! Come here! (dune buggy rumbling) Where's your machine, fella? It's back there dry. Listen, you got any gas I could have? Gee, fella, the only folks I know who'll give you people something for nothing is welfare. Carol, are you with welfare? Not me, Gordie. Well, fella, I'm not with welfare either, so I guess you're just outta luck. Look, man, all I want is the gas. Now, if it's the money you worried about, I can send that to you later. Fella, you people don't have such good credit ratings, you know. Maybe we can make a trade. How 'bout that vest of yours? It'd make a groovy doormat. [Carol] Yeah. Hey, wait, hold it. Wait a minute, maybe I'm being selfish. That's my hangup, I'm too materialistic. Maybe we can do business on a service basis. Let's see. No, you couldn't do my shoes. I'm not wearing any. (Carol chuckling) Hey, Carol. Yeah? Maybe there's something he could do for you. You could be the first one in your sorority to find out if that old black magic bit is really true. It'll only make little holes fella, but it'll make a lot of 'em. What do ya say, Carol? You know me, Gordie, I'll try anything once. Sorry, mama, not this once. You know, chicks like you are always such a letdown. You know, I bet you moan a lot. Hold it, hold it, you son of a bitch! (dune buggy rumbling) - What do you want? - I gotta talk to ya. (chuckles) That's great. Hey, Juice, we gonna get us another hippie sermon. (Juicer chuckling) You guys ever do nothin' but talk? Listen, man, you heard me try to talk to that crazy bastard today in the trial. [Long John] Yeah, that's what I mean. Talk but you don't do nothin'. Dragons come in here. You didn't do nothin', and it cost you one of your people. You cost us one of our people! [Long John] You sayin' I snuffed the chick? - No, man. - Well, what is it? I don't know. Yeah, you know, you know. You can't say it 'cause then you gotta do somethin'. You ain't got the balls for that. So, you're just gonna hang back and let the General do his thing. Christ, somebody could do your own mother in front of you and you'd flash 'em the peace sign when they was done. (Juicer laughing) Listen, man, I don't expect someone like you to understand why we prefer talk to violence. I don't know who murdered Astrid. I don't even know if that matters now, but there's been too much blood. There's been too damn much blood and because of that, we're gonna help you outta here... If we can.

Oh, really smooth. I served it about 15 minutes ago. Fantastic. What about the other stuff? The bonfire, booze, weed. It's all happenin'. Great, let's just hope these cats are ready for a party. That's good. That's good. Nobody does it like you do, baby. A little harder. A little harder, get the iron, baby. [Clean Sheila] Like this? Ooh, ooh, that's the number, baby. Ooh, that is good.

We're all leavin' here tomorrow mornin'. Us, the flower freaks, even you guys. And I came to thank you. - For what? Mainly for your headlight, and your carburetor, and you too, punk, for your tank. Blow it out your ass. (General laughs) No, no, no, no compliments, no compliments. You save those for tomorrow mornin' just before you shove off. Well, Louie, it looks like there's gonna be a party tonight. I don't care how good it looks to you and Crab, I want you to stay put, understand? Right. (eerie music) Right, teacher. I'll tell Crab as soon as he gets back. I'll tell him exactly what you said 'cause I'm in charge now, right? (door creaking) (retro rock music) Man, man, man, I must've done that 10,000 times. - Crab, Crab, Crab! - But it was never anything- The teacher told me to tell you- [Crab] Did you ever go outside to take a leak? - Crab! - You're gonna find it- Now, you stop! Crab, you're not payin' attention to me. Now, Louie, I gotta tell you somethin', man. Crab, you gotta pay attention to me! I'm the miner now and you gotta- (hand thudding) (Crab groaning) (Louie chuckles) Now, that's better. Now, the teacher told me to tell you that we can't go to the party tonight no matter what. Shit, we better get 'em to unlock this thing before they waste each other. [Louie] We've gotta stay here and do our work. Hey, Louie? Louis? No talking. No talking in class. [Long John] Hey, Louis, listen up. Oh, it must be those bad kids the teacher put in the cloak room. No, no, oh, no, man, we ain't in the cloak room. We're in the supply closet gettin' the crayons for the teach. Crayons? The teacher? [Long John] Yeah, that's right. Yeah, sure, we're gonna do the drawin' next. Drawing? Ooh the crayon. Those green ones (chuckles). (eerie music) And those blue ones. Wow, those yellow ones. Yeah, see, Louis, we got kind of a problem. So, we got in, we got in here, and now we can't open the door again. So, you're gonna have to come and let us out. (eerie music) Why? Well, 'cause the whole class is waitin' on the crayons. Now, hurry up, Louis or our teacher's gonna get real mad at you. Why? [Long John] 'Cause the whole class is waitin' on the crayons. Oh. Okay. That's good Louis, good. You just bring that key over here. Yeah, the key. Right on. (truck engine roaring) (horn honking) [Jagger] Who's in that truck? Hey, what's happenin', Monk? - What happenin', man? - Dragons, man. They're holdin' Long John and Juicer out there in the dessert in a ghost town. We gotta haul ass back out there and get 'em. (bikers yelling over each other) (steel clanging) - Ah!

(Henry catcalling) - You guys in here? - Yeah, get in here. What about the wheels? No luck, man. They're all chained or they're outside where everybody can see 'em. - The van? - General's got the rotor. Shit. Why do we have to split anyway, man? [Long John] The hell you mean why? Well, I mean if the General was gonna cut out in the mornin', man, I mean like maybe we could hole up. I don't know where there's any places where you guys can hide. Be cool, be cool, man. I don't like the idea of hangin' around here anymore than you do. Juicer's got a point. Ain't no time to get nowhere between now and the mornin'. Any of these places got a cellar, man? Nope, no cellars. Wait a minute, wait a minute, this place used to be mining town. Yeah, yeah, but the mine caved in about 50 years ago. That's what killed the town. - Ain't there a shaft? - No shaft. They're all collapsed. There's nothin' there but that sluice. (woman giggling) - Where are ya? - Come on over here. [Man] Bitch. - Wait, the belfry. - Huh? Yeah, the belfry, I shoulda thought of that. Nobody goes up there. [Biker] Ooh, baby. (man whistles) Woo! Oh, baby. - I know it. [Biker] Oh, baby, baby, can you help do that? [Brain] I love it. (slow blues music) Get loose, ladies. Look, man. Lemme see that. (people laughing) That's the way, Magic. Now don't freak out, man. (party goers talking over each other) - Do it to it, ladies. - Shake that ass. [Magic] Bring it here, baby. Bring it here to fuck. (wood creaking) Hey, we're gonna need a couple things. [Henry] What? See if you can get a blanket. And a Coke and a joint. Yeah that's right, Coke and a joint, yeah. Somethin' clean to bandage his hand with, a pack of matches and see if you can get a lantern. Make sure she's full. A lantern? Man, they'll see the light. I'll keep it covered. Look if they see the light, man. Hey, Henry, Henry, Henry, it'll be cool. Be cool, man. Just go and get that shit, okay? - Okay. - Right. (man humming) (can thudding) (beer trickling) (Brain groaning) (suspenseful orchestral music) (motorcycles rumbling) [Biker] Screw the heat, we don't stop for nobody. [Officer] Forget it, there's too many of 'em. (bikers snoring) (wind whistling) (General spits) (General sighs) Ooh shit. (General groaning) (bikers snoring) (wind whistling) Louie, Crab! (door squeaking) You stupid sons of... - Hey, hey, man, I dunno- - You dumb bastards. (chair crashing) Crab, Louie, c'mon, get up! Crab, Louie, dumb bastards! [Crab] Hey, you don't know what happened to me! Wait until ya- - I'll kill 'em! - General, General! - Brain, Brain! I'll kill 'em! Brain! Brain! (biker snoring) Brain! Brain! Stupid sons of bitches! Hey General, hold it. Wait a second. - Hey, I'm gonna leave. - General, wait! - Wait! - Hey, General, wait a second. - That so? Can't you do anything? - Outta my way. (ominous music) I don't know, man, someone helped 'em. What's goin' on down there? General just flashed we checked out early. [General] You let 'em get away. What's the matter with you guys anyway? - Now what? - Sit tight. - General, wait a sec. - How's the hand? - What happened, man? - It's killin' me, man. - Somebody spiked it. - They really messed it up. [Louie] General, we don't know! - I'm gonna kill 'em! - Hey, what's that for? - I'll kill 'em! - I ain't sure yet. [General] Go get that hippie chick that served the food. Go on! Dumb bastards. (retro rock music) (motorcycles rumbling) We hit that town, just whoop ass. Right on. Well, let's get it on! Let's do it. (motorcycles rumbling) To save yourself an ass stompin' fucker, which one of your chicks fixed the food last night? You asked for it. (Henry groaning) Get her! (Vicki screaming) No! Let go. (suspenseful music) No, let me go. Hold it, you three. Back off. Stop! No! No! (ominous music) (Vicki screaming) (hand thudding) (Vicki screaming) (body thudding) It's about to hit the fan. Better tell me where those bastards are or I'll tear you apart. No! No! - You talk! (Vicki panting) Where are they? You better talk, baby. - No! Oh okay. (Vicki screaming) We'll get you to talk. You ain't gonna like this at all. (Vicki screaming) No! (Vicki screaming) [General] Hey, sister, come on. I'm gonna be good to you. I ain't gonna hurt you. - Lemme go. Henry, Henry! (ominous music) Hot. Henry! I hope you're a lot tougher than you look. Henry! Henry! No. (Vicki gasps) No! No! No! No! - General! Cut that engine! [Long John] Lay off her! We're comin' out. Where are ya? (light dramatic music) Hey, well, hello, boys! How are ya? Oh we're just overjoyed about seein' ya again. Ain't we, boys? Just like a couple of lost sheep. Welcome back, boys! (suspenseful music) Now you didn't figure we'd split without saying goodbye now did ya, huh? We wouldn't do a thing like that, would we boys? - Hell, no! - Oh no. Not ever! (suspenseful music) Okay. Hey, you, drop that mother torch. Drop it. Lose it! Any one of you move, this lantern and this cocktail go right in the middle of them chops. Juice, get the rotor. Henry, you take that rotor and start the van. Watch it, watch out! (suspenseful music) (Long John groaning) (fist thudding) (Juicer groaning) All right, come on (claps). Let's get these guys up to the sluice. Hold it! It's all over. No more orders. You mess us up every time we turn around. You shot your wad, General. You don't lead anymore. I'm takin' over, now! Well, well, well, good old Axe. I never figured you had the stuff, but you know the rules. You want this hat? You're gonna have to carve me out of it. (suspenseful music) But first I'm gonna finish this. I always finish what I start. I'll be right here. All right, what are you waitin' for? Get these guys up to the sluice. Listen to you! Man, you're insane. - Him too. You stay away from me. I don't wanna hurt anybody. General, you gotta listen to me. You can't do this thing. (boot thudding) (Henry groaning) Oh, yeah, Axe, this little creep swiped your knife, man. This is yours, isn't it? Yeah. (ominous music) Where'd you get that knife? (foot thudding) Out! - Astrid. - You mean the dead chick? Yeah. Is that the knife that stuck her? Yeah, that's the knife. (intense orchestral music) You wanted it? (helmet thudding) (Vicki screaming) (Axe groaning) You got it! (fist thudding) (motorcycles rumbling) (tires screeching) Let's get the fuck outta here, man. We're gonna get wiped out. - Come on, Henry. - Wait. Woo hoo (chuckling). - Kill the mothers! - We should go now. Come on, man, let's get outta here! C'mon, man, let's go. We gotta get these guys up to the sluice. I'm splittin', man, I'm makin' it. (bottle shattering) (Brain screaming) (biker laughing) Let's go! (bikers shouting) (retro rock music) - Woo, woo! - Ya hoo! (motorcycles rumbling) (bikers cheering) (wood thudding) (biker crashing) Lemme off, lemme off, man. You in the hat! You!
