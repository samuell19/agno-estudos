You can't escape this time. You just run. I'll deal with him. How can you withstand? Uncle Wang... Kill them! Seems good. Another style again. Hold on. He's mine, that guy is for you. What the hell? Hey, don't die. Our fight hasn't ended yet. Wah-jee! Wah-jee! Uncle Wang... Wah-jee, are you alright? You have your Uncle Wang with you. Uncle Wang... Aren't you a real man? Are you scared? Wah-jee, use the styles I've taught you: "Back-to-back and retreat". Just run! Wah-jee! Kaung Wu-chun has escaped to Tibet. Don't you know anything? Uncle Yan, as long as you give an order. I'll assemble a team and take care of him. You talk big. Do you think you can beat him? 1 have the Four Devarajas. Surely, we can defeat Kaung! Even if you have ten, so what? Lao Jing. You better kill Wang and those who've escaped first. Justice has to be done. As for Kuang, let me kill him myself. You can't run away today. Why not just be brave and end your life now. Jing-shi... You should know that 1 wasn't behind the killings. Why did you come here to get me? You did take part though. Come on! Make a move! Senior Huang. Why are you sneaking around here? Nothing, 1 haven't done anything. Nonsense! 1 caught you peeping behind the door. 1 wasn't. 1 just saw you kill an animal. So, anything wrong with that? Oh yes. Abbot once said a monk can never kill another living thing. You got nine ring scars on your head so you can't kill a thing. 1 don't have nine ring scars on my head so 1 can kill if 1T want! Follow me. Yes. Stop! Senior Huang. Put down the barrels and do something else. Yes. You have to carry forty pails of water today. Alas, another forty pails. What a bad day! Amitabha... What's the matter? Senior Huang? Do you know the meaning of "Monk under an umbrella"? 1 don't know. It means lawless. Lawless? You didn't get dressed. Amitabha... Is the evening lecture over? Yes. Ching Wai, Ching Shou, you two are on duty tonight. Yes, Senior Huang. If you can't do this thing well how can you be fruitful later? 1 already got a "fruit". Refill the temple oil. Yes. Come here! Going up! Ah! It's almost finished. When you're done refilling, clean the altar. - I'll check outside. - Yes. Who is it? Wah-jee, what's wrong? What's happened? Someone is chasing us out there. Someone is chasing us out there. Close the door quickly! Close the door! Don't let him go. You trying to flee again? You Mien Tsu-mun are killing us. Don't make any trouble. Go inside the temple. No one can interfere with whatever we want to do. Ching Wai, Ching Shou, go rescue them now. Be careful. Play the Bamboo Flute Underneath the Blue Sky. Sword pointing up at the world and meeting in the spring. Wang? Are you alright? Take care of them! Wang, are you alright? Wah-jee... Wah-jee... He's not responding. Wah-jee! Don't scare me! Wah-jee! Wang. Wah-jee! Wang! What can we do? 1 keep this for him... at my side at all times. Wah-jee... Thank God! I'm such a smart guy. Abbot. Those bodies have already been moved to Mei Hwa Stream. - Senior Huang. - Yes? 1 can forgive most sins but killing people... 1 can't support that. They'd have killed me if I'd let them. Well... 1 don't care. In short, it is not allowed within a temple. Monks should be merciful. You will never reach a state of grace if you sin again. Hey... Hey. What are you two doing? Practicing Kung Fu. You call this Kung Fu practice? I just call it lousy. - We practice like this every day. - Right. Let me show you my Kung Fu then. - He acts like a crippled horse. - How can he fight? You really look like a cripple. Seal-handed Buddha. Let's see how it goes. Play the Bamboo Flute Underneath the Blue Sky. Watch out! Fetch a basket around the sun and the moon. 1 can't see anything! How can it go around the sun and the moon? This is called the Sticky Style. Sticky? As in stick together? How can you stick us when we aren't together? I'll catch you two and stick you. You can catch me, huh? Come on, try to stick us. If you can stick us together I'll eat dinner upside down. Yes, that's right. Come on! Ha! You're on! Go away! The game is over. 1 won. It won't be that easy! Don't let him catch us. You give up yet? Ching Shou, are you alright? 1 told you to stop. You hurt? Hold on. Hey, we're eating now. Huh, we had a bet. Have you forgotten? - Remember? - Remember? Oh, yes, we remember, it's time to eat. Yes, but still upside down. You didn't stick us together. That's right. Huh, is that a fact? Alright. How about now? No more eating. That's for you. Don't run away. Give up? No way! - What about you? - No. Are you alright? Sticking together. Ouch! It hurts. Ready to eat now? Yes, that's right! The rice looks good. Turn upside down to eat. We will... It's very easy to eat this way. The corn is so tender. It's hard to swallow. Hard to swallow? What's going on? Oh, they're fulfilling their promises. What's that? Drinking soup. Oh, Master... How come the soy milk has soured? Soured? No, it's alright. Huh, those damn lazy monks. From now on, buy the soy milk yourself. Me? Yes. Wah-jee. Yes? You don't have a jug, how can you bring it back? You know where to buy it? 1 know, at the foot of the mountain. Well, I'm going to count down from 1 to 2,000. - You'd better be back. - From 1 to 2,0007? 1, 2, 3... 4,5, 6... 7, 8... How about one more bowl? Tsui-jee, the soybean milk you sell is sweet and tasty just like you. Oh yeah? Yes, don't you see that? I go for one bottle every day. How about one more bowl then? This is your first one. How about getting you one more? That's good. Uncle... Don't call me uncle. 1 don't even have a beard. I'm sorry, aunt. Who is your aunt? Oh, sorry. Lady, 1 come for soy milk. Put it down. - How much do you want? - Fill it up. - Thanks. - My pleasure. - You've got to pay for it! - Oh, money! Shit. 1 forgot to bring money. Oh, you don't want to pay then? There are two kinds of people who don't need to pay. What are they? The first kind is the blind, but you're not blind. The second is the cripple, but you're not crippled either. Hey, could you make a third? There's no need. All T have to do is to break your leg. Sorry! Sorry! It's hot, my face got burned. You should pay! It looks like the Eight Immortals Fist. Anything you do, 1 can do! Defeat Wah-jee with puppy dog eyes. No teasing, come on. I'll pay you next time. Forget it, forget it. I've never seen you before. Where are you from? Oh, from Ting Yueh Temple. Oh, so Senior Huang sent you? Yes. Well, that's what he tells us. Right, remember to pay for it next time. Dad! Thanks a lot! Hey, you're really too much. What's wrong with you? Dad, are you sick again? Nothing serious. Fetch my medicine. Are you alright, Dad? Dad. 1,601... 1,602... 1,608 1,609... 1,610... 1,997... 2,000. Soy milk's here! I've already counted to 3,410. Drink up the soy milk yourself, then hurry up and start working. All of it? OK. That's it. What? They sold out? Why so little? Nope. They've filled it up. So you spilled it! Go clean the bonfire. Alright. Nice. You do the job. May Buddha bless you. Amitabha... Ching Wai, Ching Shou, you guys go outside. - Senior Huang. - Out! Now, you take over their duties. What should 1 do? Clean up the altar. Refill the oil. Keep writing. What should 1 write? Brother, 1 found out where Wah-jee is hiding. Hope you'll come here right away. We'll kill him together. Wah-jee is around... Nearby here means a neighbour. Hope you reach me in time. In time. In time... Hurry. Yes, it means hurry. Reach me? I'll put an arrow here. That should work. "Reach me" is "to me"? So, cut the weeds by removing the roots. Cut... Cut... Drawing a knife means to cut. The weeds... By removing... Removing starts with an "R"... Can't spell "roots". Routes sounds the same anyway. From Fourth Brother. Good morning. Why are you so early this morning? Don't mention it. Before dawn. Senior Huang sent me here to buy soy milk before dawn. Speaking of soy beans, I have to get more now. See you. We aren't ready yet. You can go in and get it yourself. Alright, I'll get it myself. Can you manage it? Sure, no problem. - Would you like Tsui-jee's help? - Nope, I got it. - I'll head back now. - OK. Fourth Brother. Third Brother, why are you so late? I came right away when I got your letter. Have you found that guy yet? Follow me, 1 know where he is. FU SHOU [Fortune and Longevity] STREET Have your meal outside or stay over there! Can I go inside to look for someone? Huh, are you the God of Treasury? I'm even more dignified than the God of Treasury. Get out of my way. Don't you dare next time. Hey, I'm here. Don't you dare to break into someone's house again. So you feel like touching my arm, do you? Not even with a barge-pole. - Fourth Brother, stop. - What? Lady, I'm sorry. We've come here looking for some guy and we thought that he was in there. So then, uh. Are you looking for Wah-jee? Yes, yes! That's him. He was here. He got soybeans and went. Oh, thank you! Ha-ha! Tsui-jee, what happened? Dad, some guys came here looking for Wah-jee. Wait! You know we've been waiting for you? Put it down and help them. Yes. That's all your fault. If you had come back earlier we wouldn't have had to do so much. It's all because of you that we were blamed by Senior Huang. Help ignite the fire quickly. Be quick! Hurry up! You've no idea. There's smoke all over the place. Lots of smoke. How did you do it? You don't even know anything about lighting the fire. You're an idiot. When you get the beans tomorrow borrow a stone-grinder as well. Who is it? It's Wah-jee. You come to get the soy beans at night? No, I'm no longer living in the mountain. I'm here to say goodbye. Please tell uncle I'm leaving now. Hey, Wah-jee, some guys came for you today. For me? Yes, two guys dressed in red overcoats. They said they must get you. 1 fought with them because they sneaked outside. Their Kung Fu wasn't bad. Really? Where have they gone? It seems that they've gone to a whorehouse. I'd better go back to the mountain. Liar. Hurry up! Buddha bless you. Buddha bless you. Do give some more oil. Abbot! May 1 help you? No. 1 just come to worship God. Ah-shui, you have to give more. The more, the better. Buddha bless you. As far as I'm concerned 1 have a brother who wanted to be a monk. It is said he stays here. Do you know him? What's his Buddhist name? 1 don't know his Buddhist name. 1 only know he's called Wan Pu-yun. Wan Pu-yun? We have a senior in our temple but 1 don't know his real name. The former abbot took him in but he's impetuous. Is he the man you're looking for? 1 don't think he's my brother. Thanks. Ah-shui, let's go. Where's your donation? May Buddha bless him! They just pretended to donate. May Buddha bless! Mien Tsu-mun is harmful to the martial circle. They should have been uprooted. Unexpectedly, I spared your life then became a profound origin of sin. Your Liu-he gangs must be eradicated. Well, let's settle it. Where are you going this late? I must leave you. Am 1 hard to get along with? We give you your basic needs here. What else do you expect? You sent me down the hill before dawn to buy soy milk and beans and had me do lots of chores. When evening comes, 1 serve in the temple. Don't you think all of this was too much? Hold on. Take back this jade pendant. It's probably better for him to leave. Give me a bowl of soy milk and a piece of fritter. Thanks. Ah, is that Tin-hau Temple? Why didn't he show up? Tin-hau Temple. Here he is. Fourth Brother. Third Brother. You stole my stick for what? Give me it back. He's nuts. I'm going to Kill you. Are you out of your mind? Fourth Brother, are you alright? 1 should have beaten him up. Fourth Brother, forget it. Don't be upset with such a lunatic. Where's Third Brother? He's in the whorehouse. Let's go. Sir, come again when you have time. Sir, upstairs' rooms are full. I'll show you another room. I'm not... Don't be silly! Don't be shy. 1 know it's your first time. No worries. We'll offer you good services. You must be mistaken. I come here looking for my friends. Looking for your friends? - The guys wearing red overcoats. - Oh! Go upstairs. Find them yourself. Thanks. We were having fun, why did you ask me to come out? We can have fun later. After we're done here, we'll go to Ting Yueh Temple and kill Wan Pu-yun. Are you confident you can do that? Better to kill everyone than risk missing our target. We will have to kill Senior Huang. Senior Huang? Second Brother should enjoy today. Let's go to Ting Yueh Temple. Master! Senior Huang! Where's Senior Huang? - Wasn't he in his room? - No, he wasn't. Perhaps he's out catching snakes. Outside? Master Huang! Why did you come back? I've returned to save your life. Save me? How can you rescue me? In the village I saw that red-nosed guy who chased me last time. He's coming with his two brothers. They want to kill you and that one called... Wan Pu-yun. - Wan Pu-yun? - Yes. Go quickly! Why do you stand still? They're coming to kill you, not me. You're also in danger. Uncle, you seem tired. Why don't you put it down and get some rest? If you're tired, rest here. Don't say it's me. Wah-jee hasn't come for two days. He's probably very busy. We should help him. Don't you know that I'm helping him now? 1 think these two packets of soy beans would be enough for them. These two men looked for Wah-jee before. We're still far away from Ting Yueh Temple. Let's go. DAXIONG HALL (Jewelled Hall of the Great Heroes) Senior Huang, you can't just leave. If I've done anything wrong, please punish me. Help me to persuade him. Senior Huang... I've already handed over all responsibilities to Abbot. Let's go. Mien Tsu-mun. Do you know all 8 styles? - Only 7. - What about the Sticky style? - Not yet. - Still not yet?? Use Sticky style. Be careful. Master, you... Three in one. Watch out for the Leopard Fist style. You know this pretty well. You two go now. Hurry up. Wah-jee, leave quickly. Wah-jee! Tsui-jee, just run now. I've got him here. Dad! Dad... Eldest Brother, it's good that you've come early. Where's our Third Brother? Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! Are you a man? You don't save people from death. You think that I'm willing to watch my younger brother die? Younger brother? 1 had no choice. Dad... Older brother said that we must leave quickly... Wait, carry Wah-jee and leave. This is for him. Kam Shing, Pu-yun, you two head off that way. Dad, Dad! Second Brother. I'm afraid that Eldest Brother can't withstand it. Let's go help him. Still trying to run away? Jin-shi, it's me who killed your brother. It has nothing to do with them. Let them go. Eldest Brother! We never spared anyone's life. You two leave quickly, hurry. Leave quickly! Wah-jee, no time for crying. We can't stay here long. Eldest Brother, there's no one inside. Let's go. Wah-jee, show me what you have learnt. Yes, Uncle. Footwork of Tsu-wu. Linking like Guaizi Ma. Seal-handed Buddha. Not quite there yet. Play the Bamboo Flute Underneath the Blue Sky. Still not as perfect as what your Dad can do. Dad, how come his Eight Immortals Fist is different from mine? He's doing the first four moves. I taught you the last four moves. So, what is the difference? It's because you can't practice the Eight Immortals Fist all at once. Upper part focuses on defence, lower part on offensive tactics. Anyway, the core parts of these eight styles are: Slow, push, poke, buckle, adjust, dodge, hold, and stick. Play the Bamboo Flute Underneath the Blue Sky is the most perilous move. Your dad made this move by accident and that ruined our whole family. You must start practising the lower part from today. You must also strengthen your force speed, and accuracy as well. Pass your hands through the bamboo. How?? Do the Eight Immortals Fist? Seal-handed Buddha. Seal-handed Buddha. Summon your energy to your fingertips. Are you alright? Quickly fetching a basket that enshrouds the sun and the moon. Are you alright? I'm fine. Continue with the practise. You won't succeed like that. Try again. Mind the speed and accuracy. Come on! You have to be faster than me. Come on. Not bad. Uncle, should 1 buy some wine? Nope. That's not how you should get the money. How should 1 get it then? All coins are over here. You must fetch them after coming through the bamboo. It's a piece of cake. Now do it, come on. It's not as easy as you think. Practise. Why can't 1 get them? 1 don't know. My dad didn't teach me that. - Uncle? - Dad! Uncle, are you alright? Herbal wine. Dad...! We've run out. Dad! Hurry up. Finally, 1 bought it. Trying to escape? Your Kung Fu has improved. My turn now. You can't tell the difference between truth or fiction. Saving my uncle is much more important. Elder Brother, you-- 1 want to round up all of them. - Good morning. - Good morning. Uncle, how do you feel? I'm fine. Go and practise your Kung Fu. 1 know, Uncle. Have more herbal wine. It's fine. Welcome. Anything about Kaung Wu-chun? Show me my money first. Your money is here. Where's Kaung? He's in Ta-mo Temple. Here is the money for you. Thanks. This way please. Finish him off! I'll go to Ta-mo Temple first. You old dirty bastard! Really living in reclusion here. Kuang, you're wrong. You think you can really escape from public life? 1 have been waiting for you for years. It's too early for me to escape from public life. You know I'll meet you. Before 1 kill you, hand over the copy of The 36 Deadly Styles. The 36 Deadly Styles is already gone. You burned it already? That's right. You learnt the subtlety of The 36 Deadly Styles and burned the copy. Leaving nothing for anyone else. The mere copy caused a catastrophe in the martial circle and destroyed many heroes so 1 burned it. You learnt it and burned it. You're so selfish. No, 1 just burned it before 1 had opened and read it. Are you trying to deceive me? Yan Zhen-tian, your bad temper hasn't changed a bit in the past 30 years. 1 understand that you'll never believe me. I'll kill you myself. That's what... I have been waiting for for so long. Get down here quickly. No rush, I won't duel with you at Ta-mo Temple. Ten miles from here. Ching Long Mountain is your ideal graveyard. Have you seen a guy bringing vases and passing by? He just lives over there. What a nice place! It's the graveyard for both of you. Leave here, you two. Dare to escape? You have only one road to travel: the road to hell. Leave, you two! Why don't you use the 36 Deadly Styles? Actually, 1 don't know how to use it. I'll force you to use it. Oh, I see. It's Yin Yang Phoenix Eyes. Show me all you've got. Dad! Your Kung Fu is pretty good. Two Snakes Depart from the Grave! Show it by all means. This is not the 36 Deadly Styles! 1 don't know the 36 Deadly Styles at all. You two, just run! Let's go help Wah-jee. Let's see how your Eight Immortals Fist works. Try Seven-Star Kill and Flying Horse! Your father also died doing this move. What about trying this one? Play the Bamboo Flute Underneath the Blue Sky. 1 knew you'd do this. The Eight Immortals Fist... 1 know it much better than you. So, should 1 show you the rest? Sword Pointing up at the World and Meeting in the Spring. Not bad, right? Using the Footwork of Tsu-wu. Linking like Guaizi Ma. Seal-handed Buddha. 1 must ignite the bonfire. Turn the Heaven and the Earth upside down. Upside down?
