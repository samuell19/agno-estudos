- Ruri? - Yes? Is your brother coming for Eid al-Fitr tomorrow? Or is he staying at your sister-in-law's house? Mom, it's not like you don't know what Lukman is like. Of course he'd stay at Darti's first. Then, he'd come here next. I'm just asking. Who knows. I was hoping we could do the Eid prayer together. Mom, she's causing trouble! It's not me. It's her! Don't play with food! - That's not nice. - I won't play with you. I'll play with Yoga instead. See? You can do it. That's how you do it. Just woke up? - Are you going stay long in Solo? - I'll leave on Thursday. Why so soon? Come on! Eid al-Fitr only happens once a year. Can't you stay longer? Don't you miss Mom and Dad? Of course, I do. All you do is work, work, and work, but there's no result. There is no house. You're not married yet. You never... Hey! Don't go! Damar! - I'm going to smoke. - Damar, I'm not done talking! That's how you do it. Let me do it, Dad. It's fine. I love doing this. Why are you watering at night? Usually I do it at noon, but earlier, your mom wanted me to go with her to the market. She ran out of spices. Dad... I saw a wayang kulit puppet on top of the wardrobe. Why is it not on display? I don't have its partner, yet. If I'm not mistaken... What's his name? Adipati Karna, right? Who's his partner? Wait. How did you know about Karna and all that? Of course I do. If I'm not mistaken, he shared a father with Arjun, right? He was the one who was born from an ear. Arjun. Just buy Karna's partner. It's too beautiful not to be displayed. You act like you don't know your mom. I'm still waiting for my pension money. Don't wait for the pension money. I'll buy it for you. - Don't. - I'm being serious. I'll transfer it to Mom's account. Darling! Yes, dear. - Darling! - Yes. Come on! You have to taste my spicy fried chicken liver. If it tastes bad, you'll complain. I tasted it earlier, honey. No, you didn't. Come taste it, now! Stop watering! - Why are you laughing? - Let me do it, Dad. Come on! Why do I have to taste it over and over again? It'll still be chicken liver. It won't turn into beef. - Yes, Mom? - Dad wants to talk about wayang kulit. Mom, I'm driving. Can I call you back later? You promise? You always forget your promises. Yes, Mom. I'll just tell you now, Damar. Your dad said he wants to buy it together with you. Don't buy it carelessly. Your dad knows a seller at the square. Okay, Mom. I'm still driving. I'll call Dad later. - Peace be upon you. - Upon you too. Is it so hard to reply to my messages? Not all messages need replies. It'll only make things worse. You reply, I reply, and so on. A never-ending cycle. Does it take so much effort to reply? It only takes a minute. Seconds, in my case. Don't view everything from your perspective. That's not what I'm doing! It's normal. My friends don't ignore my messages. You're the only one who does that. Laras... I need to be alone when I'm upset. I need to clear my head. Can't we do that together? Find the solution, instead of running from the problem. Will you behave like this if we get married? Are you ready for that? DAD Why aren't you picking it up? It's my dad. I'll call him back. You don't even answer your parents' calls, much less mine. I know what he wants to say. It's not urgent. I'll call him back. So you only respond to urgent calls? So my missed calls are not urgent to you? Talking to you is exhausting! Ras. Sir? Here's the money. Laras! - Yes, Ruri? - Damar. - It's Dad, Damar. - What is it? Dad passed away. SUGENG LAKSONO 23 AUGUST 1953 - 1 FEBRUARY 2020 What are you all doing here? Where's your dad? Where's Dad? Why is no one answering? Your dad must be with his friends at the security post. Damar, it's going to rain. Go pick up your dad and bring an umbrella. Okay then, if no one's going, then I'll go myself. - Mom! - I'll go! - Mom. - I'll do it. Dad has passed away, Mom. - Damar? - Dad has passed away, Mom. Your dad is right there. If you don't want to pick him up, then I'll go. - No big deal. - Mom. - What? - Damar is right. Dad has passed away. Why are you saying this? Your dad is alive. Watch your mouth. He's there. I'll pick him up! Mom. What? It's true. - What is wrong with you all? - Dad has passed away. What is wrong with you kids? - Mom, it's raining. - I know it's raining! Your dad is outside! - Let's go inside. - Where's my umbrella? Let's wait inside, okay? Mom, let's go inside, okay? - Let's go inside, okay? - What? I can't believe Mom ended up this way. All this time, I thought... Mom is a strong woman. I am who I am today all because of her. She's just in shock, Ruri. She can't accept the fact that Dad is gone. Mom, where are you going? - To do my ablution. - Ablution? Yes. Mom, where are you going? - To perform my ablution. - You already prayed. When did I pray? No, I haven't prayed. I'll go perform my ablution. What are you eating? Forgive me, Dad... for not being able to keep my promise. So, Ruri and I... We took Mom to her doctor at Muwardi Hospital. According to Dr. Santoso... Mom has had Alzheimer's... for almost the whole year. Dad's passing has become a trigger that worsens Mom's condition. That's right. All this time, Dad hid Mom's sickness from us. So, from now on, all of us must keep in mind that Mom must take her medicine everyday. So, Mom can't live in this house alone. I'll take care of her. Are you sure, Ruri? Then, what about this house? Why don't you move into this house? It's bigger than your house. That's the problem. The maintenance is expensive. Should we... Should we sell it? Look. Damar. Did you hear what Lukman said? Mom is currently sick. How could you all talk about inheritance? Damar! This isn't about inheritance! We're trying to find a solution for the house that's going to be empty with no one taking care of it. Are you going to take care of it? Can you come here and take care of the house? Take care of Dad's land? Can you? I thought we were discussing Mom's disease. Instead, we're talking about inheritance. Take your meds. Lukman, what about Damar? Have you talked to him? He's stubborn. You know your brother. - I'm not finished. - Eat first. You know Ruri... She's lucky. She has a good career. She has a kind husband. Don't be like that. Forget about Idham. You have Ali and Alma. Of course, Damar. But they're growing up fast. Their needs are also increasing. What are you trying to say? Well, if we split the inheritance, it would be a great help. Nining, Mom is still alive. How did that even cross your mind? But Ruri has agreed to have Mom live with her. I also will help take care of Mom, Damar. Mom never left the house for more than a week. What if she wants to go home, but the house has been sold? Didn't you all think about that? She'd be so sad. It's okay. From now on, this is the schedule for taking care of Mom. Ruri made and shared the schedule in our group chat. If you can't make it, please let the others know. That's easy, Lukman, since Ruri and I live in Solo. Most likely, it'll be hard for you, Damar, and you, Lukman. But especially Damar. You live far away. Will your office allow you to take many leaves? That's the risk. It's Damar's idea, after all. I can do it. Who's calling? Hello? That's right. What is it, ma'am? Ali did what? Oh God! Okay, I'm heading there now. Gosh, these kids! You two, who taught you to beat people up? Embarrassing! Mom? Mom? What are you doing? Oh, my God! Lukman, Darti isn't coming? No, she's busy. Her online business is doing well. This nurse will replace me to look after Mom. I have things to handle and the day after tomorrow, I must return to Jogja. The nurse will stay. You need to tell her what to do. All right, Lukman. Take care. Okay. - Let's go inside. - Thank you. Peace be upon you. Ma'am, it's time for your medicine. Who are you? Who are you telling me to take medicine? A doctor? Take your medicine, so you'll get better. Excuse me, who are you? I'm a nurse, sir. Mr. Lukman sent me here. - Where's Mr. Lukman? - He's out. - Let me do it. - Yes, sir. Mom. Take your medicine, okay? Which color do you want? This one. Yellow? Sure. Hold on. Great, you'll get better! Damar, when did you get here? This morning. Where have you been? The usual... At a meeting with my business partner. But he took me to Tawangmangu to see his land. Wait a minute. Why, Lukman? Why did you hire a nurse? Why not? I'm fine with you hiring a nurse, but you should be here too. You know how Mom's disease is. She often forgets who we are. Imagine with strangers. She'll get used to it. If I hadn't come, she would not have taken her meds. Damar, I have a lot of work. On top of that, I can't leave Jogja for too long. You're still single. You can go anywhere you want. I wonder if one day you have a wife, will you still give all your time for Mom? Lukman, hypothetically, if you were a baby, and you were crying, would you rather be soothed by Mom or a babysitter? Where have you been all this time? Only Nining and Ruri visited our parents often. Who paid for the renovation when the house broke down? You know that this house needs a maintenance fee, right? Have you chipped in even just once? It's not that I want to be petty. I just wanted Mom and Dad to be comfortable. Suddenly, you're acting all concerned when Mom's sick. What do you expect exactly? Keep going! You two wouldn't dare if Dad was around. - Damar? - Yes, Mom? Why isn't your dad home? Where is he? Mom. I have to go, Mom. Peace be upon you. What's the jasmine for, Mom? I'll get going. Be careful, Mom. Let's go, sir. Darling? Darling? Darling! Darling? Where is he? Darling! Who locked this door? Why can't I open the door? Mom! - Mom! - Why is the door locked? What is it? What are you doing? I can't find your dad. Mom, it's time to sleep. It's late. I can't. I have to find your dad. Where is your dad, Nining? Open the door! Poor thing. He's out there! Why is the door locked? Your dad can't get inside! Mom. It's the rainy season. It's cold outside. It's okay. Your poor dad is out there. Come on. Open the door! Where is your dad? Dad is out of town. Your dad wouldn't leave town without me knowing! You're lying! I should know! It's impossible! I don't like that you're lying! Mom! - I don't like you. - Dad is out of town. - Mom. - Give me the key! The key is in your room. Let's get it. Darling! Let's get the key first, okay? Did you forget that the key is in your room? Did you forget? Right? Right. Where's the key, Nining? It's not here. Nining? Open the door! Why did you lock the door? Your dad is waiting for me outside! Where's Mom? She's sleeping. I don't know how to deal with her. It's okay. It's my fault. I was supposed to look after her. So, what do we do? I'm taking Mom to my house. Perhaps she'll like it there. Can you help me pack her clothes? How much should I pack? Just pack everything. Whatever she wears out and at home. I hope she can stay at my house for good. Is it going to be permanent? Shouldn't we discuss it first? Discuss? With Damar? He's the only one who disagrees with Mom staying with me. If something like last night happens again, who will be responsible? There are a lot of people at my house. And I don't panic easily like you, Nining. Ruri, why is my terrace so empty? It's barren. Mom... it's my house. I will put as many plants as I can to make it pretty like your house, okay? Where's the pot on that corner? Why isn't it here? Where's the pot with my jasmine plant? Mom, my love. This is my house. I will have someone bring your jasmine plant to the house. But, now, drink the tea while it's hot. Your terrace is too barren. There are no plants. Why is that? You can't even organize your house. Be careful, Mom. Father and son can't stop playing games! Sit down, Mom. - Put it away and eat your food. - Where are we? - Sit down first, Mom. - Please sit down, Mom. Why is the dining table different? Mom... we're at my house. Who are they? - This is Yoga, your grandson. - Yoga, Heru. This is my husband, Mom. I don't know you. Why are they here? Get out. I don't like strangers in my house. But I'm Yoga, your grandson. I don't know you. Get out. Get out! Now let's eat, okay? What do you want to eat? I made a lot of food. Do you want some chicken? If I say it's there, then it's there. Where's the pot? I'm confused. The gate was locked. Tarno couldn't get in, so... No, no. Let's do that later. I just want to say... I just want my jasmine plant. Your dad planted that jasmine plant himself. What are we going to do if the pot is gone? Listen to what your mom has to say. Mom, I'm sorry. But the pot broke. How did it break? If it broke, then replace it! Along with the plant. Why is the pot gone? And the plant is gone too? Where's my jasmine plant? Where is it? Where is my jasmine plant? Where is it, Ruri? I'm sorry, Mom. I'll replace it tomorrow. The pot broke. Nining? I'm in front of the house. The gate is locked. Mom is at Ruri's? Okay. - Hello? - Ruri? - Yes. - Where's Mom? I just got home. Wait, she's inside. Wait a minute. Just come over here. Mom is here. Hold on. Mom! Mom? Mom? Damar is on the phone. Mom? Mr. Tarno, where's my mom? I thought she went with you. - What? - She's not home? - I don't know. - Ruri? - Where's Mom? - Ruri? - What happened? - Honey, did you see Mom? She's not inside? No! - Let's find her! - Let's go! Please hold on to her. Nining. - Please look after her. - Yes, Ruri. Honey, let's go. Ruri. How did Mom leave without anyone knowing? How would I know? She must have been following me. She must be uncomfortable at your place. You know she never left her house for more than a week. She only spent three days in Jogja. You're so good at blaming people! Who do you think I do all of this for? I do it for Mom! Who paid when Mom and Dad were sick? Me! What? Dad's insurance wasn't enough! Who paid the rest? Me! I'm not trying to take credit for what I've done for Mom and Dad. Let me ask you. What have you done for Mom and Dad? Answer me! - Ruri, enough! Let's go. - Let it be! - The neighbors will hear you. - Let them hear! Mom and Dad's youngest son never thinks of them! You do it then. Now I want to see... how it will be with you taking care of Mom? I'll get going. Darling? Mom. It's you, Damar. That's unusual. Where's your dad? Even the jasmine plant has stopped growing flowers. Dad is gone, Mom. Why did you say that? Mom. I don't like that! - I hate it! - I mean... - I hate it! - I mean, Dad isn't home. He's out buying mutton soup. He went to Kliwon Market. Didn't he tell you? He should've told you. I'll let him know. Okay? Rest well, Mom. - Yes, hello. - Damar, where are you? I'm in Solo attending to family matters. Yes, I know. But everyone has family matters. Be professional! I already finished my task. I'll do the rest from here. That won't do, Damar! That isn't your office! Everyone has equal responsibility. If you can't fulfill it, just resign! Okay, sir. I'll resign. I'll email you my resignation letter tomorrow. Mom... I'm going to the square for a bit to buy a wayang kulit puppet. - I want to come too. - Just stay here and rest. Right, Mrs. Yem. Ma'am, just stay at home. The soap operas are good. - Right. - No. I want to go with my son. I can go alone. It's fine. You'll buy it from Mr. Naryo, right? - I want to come. - All right. Let's go. I'm going with Damar. Yes, ma'am. Just sit here, Mom. Excuse me? - Mr. Naryo? - Yes. I'm Mr. Sugeng's son, who called earlier. This is my mom. I see. Ma'am. Sir, have you prepared the Arjuna wayang kulit puppet? Don't worry. I've prepared it. Your dad ordered it a long time ago. He said that he was going to pick it up with his son. You're Damar, right? Yes, sir. Please wait. DEATH NOTICE MR. SUGENG LAKSONO To God we belong, and to him... - Mom. - Darling! Darling! Darling! Darling! Darling! You must be tired. Where's your dad, Damar? What time is it? Why isn't he home? - Hello? - Laras. I can't take it anymore, Laras. What happened? I don't know who to talk to. I can only talk to you. Calm down, Damar. It's my mom. What do you want to talk about? Be careful. Mom, don't forget what Dr. Santoso said. Always take your medicine. What are you doing here? Wow, it's full. Damar goes shopping often. Who cooks? Of course it's Mrs. Yem. We can rely on her. You know, when we were kids, I used to play pranks on Damar. I'd tell him that he was Mrs. Yem's son! That's right. They're still so close. Or perhaps, he really is her son? Mom. This is Laras. Ma'am. Nining. - Hello. - Laras. That's Ruri. You're his friend from Solo? I'm from Jakarta. From Jakarta. Bring Laras to her room. - Let her rest. - Yes, Mom. Excuse me. Let's eat while it's warm, Mom. This is your room. Thank you. I can't believe you're here. Are you shocked? I was so worried after hearing you on the phone. I wasn't seeking attention. - It's just that... - Cut the excuses. Don't ruin the moment. Okay. Are you happy I'm here? Am I bothering you? No, I'm glad you're here. You should rest. I'll put the bag here. Join us at the dining table. You seem nervous. Who's nervous? It's only right that he is. His girlfriend came all the way from Jakarta. Don't tease your brother. Damar is not a child anymore. Yes, Damar is at the age where he should have a child! What, Nining? Mom, Damar's girlfriend is pretty, right? Mom, I think we're doing it this year! He's finally getting married! Excuse me. Can I help with anything? No, please sit down and join us. Damar weaned from breastfeeding at the age of four. His older siblings weaned at the age of one. If that's the case, shouldn't he be the smartest one? But instead, he became the most stubborn. Ruri. Since he was small? No wonder. So, you already know. It's better that you know now. So you won't be surprised. If your dad wasn't out of town, it'd be better, right? - Laras, have a drink. - Sure. Ma'am? Who are you? I'm Laras. Laras who? Laras, Damar's girlfriend. Damar is still in middle school. - Who are you? - Damar. Why are you so big now? I am all grown up! Really? I'm Damar, your son. What time is it? I'm going to make tea for your dad. He'll be home soon. Okay, I'll come with you. That's how she is. I resigned. It's hard to go back and forth between Jakarta and here. Your mom is most important now. I have decided that I should be here. I'm going to stay here. Ma'am, are you cleaning up? Yes, I remember something. Come inside. Don't just stand there. Come and help me. What's your ethnicity? Javanese? Your name is pretty. Am I right? You're Javanese. Yes, ma'am. My dad is from Magelang. My mom is from Tumenggung. I was raised in Jakarta, so I'm not too Javanese. You're still Javanese... because your parents instilled in you all of the Javanese lessons and values. But, you are just not aware of it. This fabric... is from when I married Damar's Dad. When we got married, he had nothing. He didn't have a lot. But, praise be to God. Eventually, Damar's Dad... got a job at a bank. He was... cherished by his older clients. They said he was kind and honest. And finally, he was asked to buy this house, but he had no money. He paid in installments for years. Yes, I... I had to feed the kids with what we had, with the money that he gave us. The house is pretty. Praise be to God. Praise be to God. Wife is garwa. Sigaraning nyawa. That means a soulmate. Together, hand in hand. A soulmate. I'm giving this to you. If God wills it, and you and Damar are meant to be, wear this fabric, okay? Thank you, ma'am. You have to be strong. Please take care of Damar. Keep this. Now, can you come with me to the grave? The grave? I want to introduce you to my husband. Be careful. Where's his grave? Oh, no! What do we do? I forgot. What do we do? Where is it? Ma'am, there's no new grave here. I don't think it's here. Maybe it's there. Who are you? I'm Laras, ma'am. Laras who? Did you take me here? Why? To visit your husband's grave. Who's grave? Who died? Nobody died! How dare you bring me here! Who are you? Are you trying to kidnap me? No, ma'am, I'm trying to... - I'm calling Damar. Please wait. - Damar! Where am I, Damar? - Damar! Where am I? - Ma'am, wait here. Damar, help me. Your mom suddenly forgot who I was. Damar! I'm at your dad's grave. Be quick! Ma'am, don't! Damar, come here quick! I already told you not to follow what she wants. How could I say no? You don't know her or this town. What if something happened to her? I'm sorry, okay? Alzheimer's patients like Mom are unpredictable. You should've considered that. I didn't know this would happen. Then find out what Alzheimer's is and what its risks are. You can't just go with the flow. That's what differentiates us. You want to get things done fast. As long as it's done. I can't do that. There are things to consider before you do something or make a decision. The other day you wanted to break up. The next day you were here. You showed up just like that. Please think and consider everything first. That's why our relationship never works. I came all the way from Jakarta to Solo because I was worried after hearing your voice. I came because I'm sure of my feelings for you. I ditched all my ego and shame because I thought you needed a friend. I agree with you. Our relationship will never work. Damar... this fabric is from your mom. She wants me to wear this when I marry you one day. The day that will never come. Take care of yourself. Laras. What is it, Damar? It's nothing, Mom. Laras left already? Yes. Did you two fight? Women are like that, Damar. We like to nag. Meanwhile, you... You live life straightforwardly. Just like your dad. When I was nagging, he said nothing. He didn't respond. Your dad... He was not romantic. He never remembered my birthday. He never gave me presents. But, what I remember... Your dad... He always... left jasmine flowers... in my pillowcase. That's your dad. Just cut the branch, Damar. We shouldn't. According to your dad, it's fine to cut the branch so it'll grow healthier. Plants know who takes care of them, who waters them. If they could talk, they'd thank you. Ma'am, I'll get going. I'll come back later in the afternoon. I'll get going, sir. Be careful, Mrs. Yem. What is it, Mom? Someone put this in my pillowcase. Your dad misses me. Ma'am, you've been cleaning up for the last three days. Mom, aren't you tired? My son has grown so much. I'm afraid. We'll have a lot of guests tomorrow. Whose guests, Mom? I don't know. Forgive me, Mom. HOUSE FOR SALE My deepest condolences, Damar. Thank you. Are you okay? Are you doing well? I'm tired. I need to rest. Back in Solo... I found out one thing about the jasmine plant. Remember the jasmine plant back at the house? It's only been there... just recently. It wasn't there during high school. So, I don't know about Dad's ritual... and the jasmine plant. Every night, after locking the gates... he picked up the flowers that had fallen to the ground. He went to the bedroom... and put them in Mom's pillowcase. I didn't get to ask him... what that meant. But, I'm sure... that's how he loved Mom until the very end. I brought the jasmine plant to Jakarta. I want to continue the ritual with you... until the very end.
