♪Translated by♪ XQ2☻♥ [HOUBA! On the Trail of the Marsupilami] - Kiki, down! - Wait, wait. Help! Argh. Help! What's wrong sweety? My parrot is sick, he's gonna die. I'm, not at all, well. Did you bring him there? I don't have any money. Arghh... Oh... - We're here about the girl's parrot. - Hmm! Pulse is at 15. He has a dry throat, and stiff wings. It's rhinopharyngitis. - What nonsense! - I'll give him beak to mouth. - No! Easy, I'm a bird!☻ We're losing him! Con man! - (Stop that, now) - Impostor! The reflex-o is not bad-o. It's an attack of asthma! Souffling! Again, again! We are en train de losing the flight! [FRENGLISH] Souffling! Not in there... (Up your butt) Voila! (Get up) Animals adore me! - 5,000 palombos. - How much? 5,000, that's 50 1,000 bills. 80, 90, 100! 100 Cassandra, good job! When will you buy me notebooks, papa? - Soon, sweety. You said, two more tourists - and then you'd buy them. - Anything you need, I'll buy. So, now, will you buy me notebooks? Patchoulito, stop coloring your brother, I told you before! So, when will you buy them? Stop, el ninos. Stop running around, stoppado! will you buy me notebooks, papa? Papa, when will you buy my notebooks? Cassandra, stop! I have to pay back that son of a pollo (chicken), Mateo. - You're just a liar! I'm not a liar! Yes, you lie all the time. You lie about the Marsupilami. About my notebooks. You lie all the time! It exists! I have proof, you wanna see? Well, yeah! THAT, is its bitemark. Look. My ball signed by Andreo Franquino, greatest baseball player in all Chiquito! My ball which tha son-of-a-pollo Mateo threw in the forest, on a tiny little branch. That day the river was infested with piranhas. To get it, I had to move delicately, step by step. Then, I lose my balance I slip and... The Marsupilami saved your life, we know, papa. Mythomaniac! Go play. I've never seen this in my life. In 16 years of journalism, never. I've been around, I've interviewed the greatest I was in all the war fronts and I've never seen this. I'm in my office working on my Best-of, guys burst in, and start hauling out all my stuff, my archived footage. 16 years' worth of journalism. Do you know who you're talking to? Hello, Dan Geraldo! So, Clarisse, may I know why I must work in such conditions? Dan, let's not lie to each other. We evaluate the least profitable programs on our network, and you're in the top 5. So we're a bit concerned. So? So, either you react, or we stop. Stop? Meaning? Either next Tuesday's broadcast is a hit, or you hit the road. I can't be any clearer. Here's what I propose for next Tuesday's live show. Because you're the most beautiful flower, Loreins presents... On next Tuesday's 'V8', Dan Geraldo goes back out in the field. 16 years ago, he risked his life in Palombia. Dan Geraldo, in the heart of Palombia's tropical forest. War is on the rampage. Today, he's off again. His weapon: a V8 camera. His mission: penetrate the secret of the Payas. Legends tell of the Payas living over 200 years: myth or reality? What was the secret of their longevity? Can one live eternally? Next Tuesday's 'V8', live from Chiquito. Dan Geraldo faces the Payas: the tribe which defies time. With Loreins. Loreins, to be 16 years old, all your life. The 'Loreins' logo, should be bigger, they need to see it's our sponsor. But, it's in the right sprit, OK. So, what you're saying is, I'm going to Palombia? You have a rendez-vous with Pablito Camaron, your guide. Specialist of the jungle and of Paya culture. Which one is he? Left or right? Very amusing, Dan. Meanwhile, I advise you to do as he says. He's in contact with the Paya chief and better yet, he got us an interview. Fine, it'll be your scoop. My son did it once, he can do it again. And since you won't be back by next Tuesday, you'll broadcast, direct from Palombian TV. Plane ticket, roadmap, you leave tomorrow morning. But... That means?... I'll call you back. Hey, Mateo! - Wanna drink something? - Cafe con leche. - All right! Watch the shirt! Is that a new tattoo? Aren't there 2 l's in Kill? *K-I-L-L, no? What does he owe, so far? 160,000 palombos. That's quite a few thousands of palombos. No! No! No! - My Kiki! - Leave him alone, he's got nothing to do with this! - Why me? - Listen... I'll pay you back, I swear, Mateo, I'll pay you. Give me some time, I have a plan. What? The Marsupilami? Lemme go, you're hurting me! - The'll kill my Kiki! - No one'll kill Kiki. - Mateo! - 160,000 palombos! - When? - Tuesday! - Tuesday? Raccalo? Are you screwing me around? I've been waiting an hour for your call. I don't care. I need that money. What time will the 'pigeon' land? Voila! Back to Chiquito. Has it changed a lot since you were here last? A bit. Not too much. OK, I'll find our contact, you'll get the baggage? Full of himself, isn't he! General Pochero wants to see you. No, in fact, 'cause... So I have a rendez-vous with Pablito Camaron. He bored me with his explanations. Allez. Naranja de tu madre! (Your mother's orange!) - Petunia! - Yes? - Petunia, wait for me! - I'm waiting. You won't go to your grave sooner. - I'm here, professor, waiting. Meanwhile I have 40 extra kilos on my back. We'll see when you have 40 extra YEARS. Fine. We'll see. What was the level of iridium last time? It was... It was, precisely here, at the same time, between 6.2 et 6.3, professor. Very good. Petunia, a good botanist needs to be precise. It's enraging to go on retirement without knowing which plant releases so much iridium. That's tomorrow, you'll find out tonight, professor. The solution won't drop out of the sky. - I'd say a maxillaria. - No. No, Petunia! Petunia, I've studied all the orchids. I've never seen this species. Me, Hermoso, I've discovered an unknown orchid! Hugs 'n kisses! Easy... watch where you put your hands! ♪ If you discovered a new orchid, say "Yes we did" ♪ Yes we did! ♪ If you discovered a new orchid, say "Yes we did" ♪ Yes we did! ♪ If you discovered a new orchid, ♪ You discovered a new orchid, - What's that sound? - The sound of victory, Petunia! The sound of victory. General, General! I made a stunning discovery, look. Ah yes... Enchante, Mademoiselle. Not her. This! Ah, I envy you, Hermoso. It's lovely being a gardener. A few flowers and you're in seventh heaven. I'm a botanist. This, General, is a new species of orchid. - I call it Orchidus Hermorroidus. - You're sure about that name? Yes. Anyway, to continue my research, I'll need a bit of money, because... Ah no, I won't release any funds, now that you're retired. What about my experience, what? Experience is a comb, which life gives us after we've lost our hair. May I remind you, General, at 20 I was a Blue Belt in Austrian Savate. Like this. Hermoso, I assure you. It's time. Garden for pleasure. - I'm a botanist. - Yes, but, retired. No, Caporal, stop it with your Dzzzt! He made a suspect gesture, General. I had to intervene. But your Dzzzt, costs us a ton of electricity. - I never pay it but, still... - OK, General. I am General Pochero. Welcome to Palombia. Ooh! That thing gives you the jitters! That's what I wanted to do, TV host. But, well... - we don't always get a choice. - I'm a journalist, actually. We've been dictators from father to son. Well, I say dictator... Elected by 99% of voters! Look, My crew's waiting for me at the airport and... They can wait. First I want to show you a secret little spot in the palace. It's dark in there. I believe you like Celine? The writer? Well, I don't really have the time to read. No. Not the writer. Wow! Ah yes, it's... I know. I saw your interview with Celine in 2006. Magnifique! Thanks. Thanks. Her most beautiful stage dresses. Amsterdam, 1996. Montreal, 1999. Sydney, 2008. And Las Vegas, the gold and silver dress. She's never worn it. Beautiful, very lovely. Say, about the handcuffs, could you... - Hold this. My jewel. There's only one in the world, it's as simple as that. - OK Celine, take one. - Take one. ♪ M-hmm, mmm... ♪ M-hmm, mmm... ♪ I can't wait to fly. ♪ Oh... ♪ I'm alive. Ah, vinyl!

I'd give anything to regain my vigor of yesteryear. Don't take avantage of this, to cop a feel. - I'm not copping a feel, I'm hanging on. - Well, hang onto something else. Super... Voila. ♪ Ta-daa! Happy 82nd, professor. Go on, let's blow out the candles and make a wish. Well, half of it will come true. Pretty good, already. Petunia? Raccalo! It's always half-assed plans with you. Always. Yes! ... Yes! Where's your journalist? That too, is a half-assed plan. Naranja de madre mia! Where is he? In the palace prison? And that's not a half-assed plan?! Listen here grande *speculoos... Gimme, gimme the bag! Gimme! Call the policia! Policia! Policia! Policia! Te encontro la super-viejita Sorry. Should'a never done that. It's ridiculous. - Eh... Go on, scram! You won't arrest me? No arresta mi? I attacked the old dame. Yo agress-ado la dam-o! - Arrest me! - Beat it, go! I know my rights. Without proof I'm presumed guilty! Alor-a! Where's that son-of-a-pollo, Pochero? Look, up there! Hang on! Go get Chounino. Chounino! Oh no, not the palace prison! I don't wanna go in the palace prison! - Imbecill-ito! Idiot-os! - Shut your boca. Nobody tells me to shut my boca. I won't shut it! Well, I'm telling you to shut your boca! Y'know what, Sneezy? This is not your day. You were saying? This IS your day. Guard, guardia-nos! Gardenia! Dan Geraldo! I'm Pablito Camaron, your guide to the Payas! Oh, yes! I recognize you from the airport... Well do something! That was lame! I regret this gesture. I khregret ze gest. You hit Bolo?! - I imagine, Bolo is you? - Yes. What's the rest of your plan? Aaaaahh! Hmm?! Fine. Let's see how my youth serum is coming along. Monsieur? This area is closed to the public, monsieur. Petunia. What? Don't recognize me with my hep look? One: you've no right to be here, and two: we don't say 'hep' anymore. (What nonsense) Now, look, monsieur, you must leave! You smell of Encyclia. It's nice, my favorite orchid. Do you know why they emit this perfume? To attract insects... which pollinize the flower. It's a *perennial epiphyte. Which needs light shade and high humidity. Lots of light, but never direct sunlight. No, it's not right! If we limit ourselves, only to what's right, what then? Hermoso might come. Hermoso is so far, - and yet so near. - Yes I know, but... That's impossible! The effect is already dissipating. - What effect? Of this serum I made from the orchid. Why? It's not possible! Is that you, professor? This is disgusting. I don't feel well! Professor you're a genius! You disgust me, but you're a genius. But you disgust me. I need more orchids. Let's go. - What, now? Yes, now, in 2 hours I might be 20 years older! -All night, if need be. Off we go! - You're really not cool. Not coo?! My mother was Hitler's cleaning lady. You wanna talk about an uncool boss? Professor, in 82 years you found ONE orchid. - How do you intend... - I don't know HOW! I know WHO. He's staring at us... He's very fixedly staring. Look how he fixes us. - Lemme go. - He's fixing us. He's fixing you. - Ah no... us. - He's fixing us. - It's us, he's fixing. - Shh! You're talking too loud, you'll make him mad. Louder, I can't hear a thing. I've got a live show next Tuesday, get me outta here. - Forget it. You'll be here, Tuesday. - I'll make it worth your while. - 160,000 palombos. - How much in euros? - I dunno how much it is. - OK, OK! What's your plan? Chounino. On the desk, Chounino. The drawer. What're you doing? In the drawer. Look in the drawer. The drawer! No. Chounino, above! No, under! Chounino! The key with little balloons. Bravo, Chounino! Bravo, Chounino! Give me the key! Chounino. Da-me la key-tos. Chounino, the key-tos. Gimme the key, Chounino. Stop. I owe you two smwicks? I'll give you four if you gimme the key-tos. Ok, 5! 5 smwicks. I'll give you 5. You're negociating with an otter, is that it? It's not an otter, It's a coati. Chounino, listen to me. I'll give you 6 smwicks, and no more. Voila, good, little coati! Animals adore me. We can't stay here! - Hello? - Attaboy, the crew thinks you're real classy, with that limousine stunt at the airport! Do you call that reporting without theatrics? Not at all, I just got outta jail! Papa, I've almost no coins left. I have a new contact for the Payas. I simply need 160,000 palombos. Ask Clarisse. For 20 years, I've pulled strings, and you strut around in a limousine? Here's what you'll get: ZERO! OK, super. OK, it's done. They'll deposit it in your account. That's my account. I want cash, right away, or I won't budge. No, when I get the interview with the Paya. I want an advance. - I want an invoice. - Invoice? Shall I put Value Added Tax on your invoice, or what? Aah! - It was a cat. - I know. I'm leery of squeaky voices, now. Vamonos. I'm sailing on a makeshift pirogue, towards the frightening territory of the Payas. My guide: Pablito Camaron. Puny, malnourished, probably illiterate... I can hear you at this distance. From Palombia, I'm Dan Geraldo for V8, in the hell of the Payas. I did it all with this, including my first report from Palombia. - Which region? Couchombakita? - Couchombakita, yes. Are you married? Any kids? No, it's difficult enough in Chiquito to feed one mouth. True, you're rather far from our western standards. - Shh! - They're approaching. - Yes, and? You've heard of the Paya rituals? - Yes. You know what they did to prisoners? They buried them alive and ate their tongues. You look pretty relaxed for a guy who knows. Let's arrange a signal. An animal sound if we get separated. Ok. I can do a good duck. Quack! Quack, quack! No, wait... Quack, quack! Qurrrk! Voila. You try. Qurrrk! A duck, in a jungle?! Nothing odd about that? The best way to get spotted is to do a duck in the jungle. We need an animal that melts into the background. The yaki, for example. Couic! Bwkouic! Mbwouic! Mbrrrwic! Your mouth's fine, The jerkiness, is fine. As if you're swallowing your tongue. Bwkouic! Bwkouic! Bwrr... khh! My tongue! My tongue. Spit it out! I don't see why we don't keep the duck, it was fine. It's OK, OK. There's some kind of animals in here! I'm fine! Always walk behind me. I've been around the block. Don't worry, I know my way around a jungle. Watch the branch. Do you know the legend of the Parsley-ami? - Marsupilami. - Marble-salami. - Marsupilami. Say it right, or I'll get mad. - Mercy-pull-on-me. - Marsupilami. Keep the MAR, remove the PULL, and add SUPILAMI at the end. The Payas. Wh.. what... I need to go alone, to scout around. Any problem... you know the signal. - Can you see me? - No... Hey?! Just to be sure. This guy's sick in the head. Count to eight thousand. Eight thousand? One, two, three... 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29 60, 61, 62 126, 127, 128, 129 130, 131 426, 427, 428, 429, 602, 603, 604, 605, 606, 607 4,226, 4,227... - Twnety-seven! - What? Quack, quack? Houba! Great Paya chief. 'Mustache' gracias. Thanks for granting me this interview. How much time do I have? What? ... My watch? My watch scares you? Voila, voila, look... Voila.

When it's red, it's running, I ask questions, you answer. You can ask three questions. - Only three questions? - Yes. Two questions, left. Your immense experience is an inspiration to us all. Do you have a message to transmit, to everyone listening to us? Life is a toucan. - Life is a toucan? - Yes. That was your last question. Papa, what's burning in there? Don't touch the magic incense. I'm going to ask you, one last question. How come you speak our language so well? I have friends in Grenoble. How does it feel to lose 160,000 palombos? Impostor! Con man! Did you think I'd fall for your masquerade? ♪ "If you don't hop about you're not a Paya" Stoppado. Stoppado. Allez! All right... a joke. I thought you said you had no kids. I don't. Well, I have these kids, but they're abandoned children. I collect them. It's complicated. It's like... That's the problem with lies. You make up one thing, then you have to invent another, and it gets more and more complicated! Filthy liar! I'm not a liar. Life in Chiquito is complicated, you need palombos. OK, don't speak. Voila. Stand like this. This might be doable. Go on, be a Paya. Say something menacing. There's a *blowpipe aimed at your nape. Not bad. Again, but more menacing. There's, really, a blowpipe aimed at your nape. Just adding 'really' isn't more menacing. Ah, who's he, a cousin? - He's a Paya. A real Paya! - A real Paya? You overdid his make up. Too much paint, I think. Me, I... Wait. Can you hear me? Test, test, one, two... Me think, you: too much paint. That stings. Me think, you: very nice paint. No, but seriously! Too much paint! Seriously?! Too much paint? What idiot would say such a thing? What did you get us into? What did YOU, you get us into? Don't use the possessive pronoun. No, you got us into this! YOU got us in this mess! If you'd taken us to the Payas directly, we wouldn't be here! - Actually, yes. And sooner. - St-stop, look here... Be quiet, quiet, that's enough. Please save your saliva for your next lies. My saliva? Take that, my saliva! - You can't even spit. - Oh yeah? You can lie real good, though. Voila; world champ. You filthy liar. I'm not a filthy liar! Bonjour. Animals adore me. Can't deny, he digs me. Titi! Tchoom ooni yakchunil, affa, affa! Lo makchuluntu loopp chikaboom pai-yaa! Arrrh! Chief? Mademoiselle? Excuse me, I'm Dan Geraldo, I'm a journalist, and in my tribe, I'm a very important person. May I... Very impressive. As suave as John Steed of The Avengers, I say... What are the gonna do to us? I don't want them to eat my tongue. Stop bawling! We're not on TV! We're in the jungle, bro! What's he up to? No, please. Stop... Aah, ooh! - Dan! Do something. - Anybody?? - Daaan! Calm down! See, the way you move excites him! Stop, I don't feel well! Try to do something! I'll mess him up! I'll mess you up, you shitty little chihuahua! Take that! Aah... Stop, little chihuahua. I understand completely if you don't wanna talk about it. Once, I had an aunt who got stung in the ear by a wasp. OK, I know it doesn't compare, but... I'm simply trying to say if you want to talk, I'm there for you. What are they gonna do? Aaaahh! Thanks. Lole kebole. What's happening? - C'mere. - Ah, no. I'll walk, if I may. Moxupila kotuke Chicxulub. - Chicxulub! - Chicxulub! Kifelek. We're inside a volcano? SILENCE! I can't breathe. Let the prophecy commence! For all time, the orchid of Chicxulub has given strength and youth to the Paya people. For all time, the orchid has given life to the Marsupilami. ♪ Hou-ba, hou-ba! ...&c... -I saw one but, surely... - Shhh! The Marsupilami, guardian of the world's equilibrium. But today, the Marsupilami is threatened. Because Double-face has arrived. Double-face will steal the orchid. and kill the forest then our people will die. Like in Avatar. Only, two non-Payas can confront Double-face. The man with the square hand, and the weasel with yellow feet. Tiny Voice will recognize them, and reveal them as the chosen ones of the prophecy. I don't get any of this. The man with the square hand and the weasel with yellow feet. must both, render strength and power to the 3rd non-Paya. The Gold and Silver Woman. They must let the truth burst forth, to save the 3 treasures in the forest. But if they fail, then the world will topple into chaos. Birds will sing off-key. The jaguar will be eaten by the rabbit. - And the tree will fell the axeman. - (axeman!) Everything will taste of passion fruit. Everyone will wear their sweater around their shoulders. Turtles will have shoulders. At 12 past 10, it'll be 25 to 4. At 20 minutes past noon, it'll be 5:43. At 4:15 it'll... 'K, it' not important. (Scroll, scroll, scroll...) Ah voila! The volcano, El Sombrero, will belch fire, devasting the earth for 1,000 years and 2½ weeks. (It's the end of the world!) You are the chosen ones of the Chicxulub prophecy. CHICXULUB! We're gods, bro! - Chicxulub! - CHICXULUB! My pleasure! Oh, a Marsupilami! - Shh! - Why isn't it eating? - I dunno. You said you'd get the same cake as on my birthday! - They only had passion fruit. - Nobody likes passion fruit! - OK... - Shh, quiet! Look, we can track him with the CGPS. That yellow dot, is the Marsupilami. - Crazy gizmo you got there! - I even have the Beastly-Planet App. To see which species are disappearing, in real time. - Oh, yeah! Super! - There, look at that, the Brasilian Blue Ant, for example. 1587, 1266, 122, 8. Poof, gone! - No more Brasilian Blue Ant. - Damn fine gadget! Ah, the pandas, there are still quite a few left! They're going like hotcakes. What exactly do you intend to do with the Marsupilami? Capture it to gather orchids. For my serum. Professor, I put up with your quirks and lewd comments because you're a brilliant botanist, and I chose to learn from you, not a bimbo who powders his face every 5 minutes, or worse, with a vulgar poacher who captures animals - in danger of disappearing. - Oh-la! What a long phrase. The Marsupilami has yet to appear, Petunia. Whether it disappears or not, changes nothing. I don't know you anymore, professor. This squirrel will lead us to his cache of nuts. Negative, General, it's not a squirrel, it's a Marsupilami. - That was a metaphor. - What's that, a female? Caporal, who is this man? Start the clock! I was born 82 years ago in Bredzelburg, Austria, I arrived en Palombia at the age of 5, botanist, treated like a dog by Pochero jr. and senior, for years! All if a sudden I'm 50 years younger so I'm no longer retiring, mmy name means "Beautiful" in Spanish. - I am? - (Hermoso.) Hermoso, it was an easy one, c'mon! Hermoso, the gardener? Botanist! No. General. ♪ Houba, houba, houba ...&c... Crazy thing is, I originally came because of you. To interview the Payas. I said to myself: Gilles... Hang on, my name's not Gilles! I said to myself: Dan!

You don't look it, at all. - What's your name? - Payette. - Payette! - We're gods, what! - Taste. Me-dammit, Me-dammit! - Eat. - Oh, really, last one. Hello, hand! Hey... Hey!

We're lost, we're lost. Is that it? We're lost? Stop speaking. I'm trying to remember what the prophecy said. - The non-Payas... - The prophecy? Who gives a damn about the prophecy! I wanna go home. I'm a celebrity. Get me out of here! "Get me out of here?!" Who fulfilled his part of the contract? You wanted to see the Payas, You SAW the Payas. My 160,000 palombos! Your 160,000 palombos?

Without orchid. Since without these flowers, your eggs die, let me propose a deal. If I keep this, you'll need to get more of these for that. And if I keep all those others you'll need to go get even more of those. Not these, but those, for you. Well, for me. That's that. Interested in the job? I'll take that for a yes. Nobody move!

He's credible. - Stand beside him! - Do as he says. - Move! Piggyback each other! No, that's not even close. Voila. Hands against the wall! - There's no wall... - I don't give a damn! Hands behind your head! Elbows in tight! Do the bobsleigh! Full speed schushh! We're gonna die, my life's passing before my eyes. What did you do to him? Nothing. From now on, you do exactly as I say. Aaaahh... I know him. He's the journalist. Problem? Solution. I'm split on that Because your skin's youth begins in infancy, Loreins has created "Baby Skin". The first facial care for nursing infants. Loreins, to be 16 months old, all your life. Clarisse, I found this while moving Dan's files. I think you should take a look. Lemme go! *Not to catch-os! Not to catch-os! Not to catch-os! You'll need more than a racoon to get outta here. - It's a coati. - A racoon. - It's a coati. - No, a racoon. - It's a coati. - No, a racoon. - It's a coati. - No, I told you, it's a racoon. - It's a coati. - No, racoon. - I swiped this from the guard. - What for? You're General Pochero, leader of Palombia. You must know a way to get us outta here? I'm no longer General Pochero. There's no General Pochero! I don't even know the Palace phone number! I just wanted to listen quietly to Celine Dion. I didn't want any of this, piss off, lemme alone! And gimme my 'iPoud'! Ingrate! My 'iPoud'! Myon 'iPoud', it's broken! Leave it to the press. Clarisse. Thank god! Ok, listen carefully because I have very little time. I'm stuck in prison in Pochero's Palace. Liar. Filth! Fraud! Mythomaniac! Impostor! - Are you nuts? calling me that! - Open wide your ears. This is Chiquito, for V8. Dan Geraldo in the heart of Palombia's tropical forest. Here, in this inextricable jungle... whoops! Danny-pooh, come and eat. We're having meatballs! Dan Geraldo: media hero, in the heart of Palombia's tropical forest. Here, war is on the rampage. Watch out aunty, it's gonna get a bit noisy! What is all that noise? - You OK, aunty? - What're you doing? Everything OK? That was the 5th take. There are twelve. Clarisse, I can explain. Dan, I advise you to be on time for the live show. With a scoop. If not, I have one which I won't hesitate to broadcast. Is that clear? See you in 19 minutes. - Oh, no. - What? If I'm not on air in 19 minutes with a scoop, she'll broadcast my report. What report? I made a fake report. I've never been to Palombia nor Couchombakita! I know, Couchombakita is a soccer player. Right away, I saw you were a mythomaniac. I'm gonna do something which annoys me profoundly. But, I'm gonna save your neck. I your washing machine, 'camera', I have... Listen carefully. Better than that! I filmed the Marsupilami. Hmm. Is that all you have to say? Hmm? I'm talking about the discovery of a new species. An animal no one thought existed but it does exist! An egg-laying mammal. Yellow and black half leopard, half koala, with a cute gerbil face, and 8 metre tail! That's a scoop! What, you need a cool drink? You have, in this camera, the means to show the whole world, that I'm not a liar, and you're a real journalist! A real journalist. - A scoop. - A scoop! In my camera. Yes, OK, let's go! Yes! Yes! You're right, Pablito, we can get out of this mess. Ok, let's get organised. My live show is in... My watch is broken. Ok, let's get organised. There, a wall. Here, bars. There, guards. You... you're of no use. Voila. It is possible. It's crazy but it could work. Pablito, I have an idea. Hey, gringos! Aaahh! What's the rest of your plan? - Did it work? - As you can see. What now? - Are we outside? - Practically. General. Shake it off. You're our only way out of here. I beg you, make an effort. We have very little time. Think, there must be a way. Your ancestors must have left, I dunno, a secret passage, a tunnel and stuff... - General, may I ask a question? - Yes. - Forget him, he's out of it. - What would Celine do? Always defended animal rights, hasn't she, Celine? - Yes. She sleeps with her labrador. - And her rat. - with her rat. Would she have left a Marsupilami in the lurch? Let him get massacred and do nothing? - No. - Is the Marsupilami cute? - Very... Very cute. What would Celine have done? Celine... Why didn't you say there's a secret passage? Because it's secret. I like it. What about me, how do I look? - Young. - Young. Perfect. Put them up, all over. How are you doing in there? If I can make plants grow faster, it'll work with animals too. Maybe even with humans. OK, one thing at a time. - What're you doing, Petunia? - What am I doing? I'm leaving you to your new life. - Exploiter of the Marsu. - Exploiter of the Marsu?! Such big words all of a sudden. Nowadays, who succeeds without exploiting nature? You... Before. That's all over! I gave my whole life to flowers. What did I get in exchange? Nothing! Time for the flowers to give me something, now. And, Loreins is giving me a pile of dough for the Hermorrhoid Anti-wrinkle Cream with my serum! I may not have legs up to my armpits, but I have a conscience. - Petunia, come back here. - Never! So, Caporal, all set? Have you trained the Marsupilami to fetch orchids? No, General, he won't do a thing. He's a real savage beast. He was always a savage beast, but now, even more. I'm sure these three will be easier to train. - For the moment, they're not ready. - Well, they're eggs. Go put them in a safe place. General, what do we do about the Marsupilami? Do whatever you want. Fine, I will do what I want. Shall we take a shower, huh girls? I have neutral PH soap. Young! The Marsupilami's eggs! - With tiny Marsupilamis inside? - Exactamente. And there's my camera. What do we do? If we recover it we have a scoop. So... well? OK, how many soldiers? No idea. A hundred or so. A hundred? I propose a siesta. No, we must absolutely save those eggs. I'll cause a diversion. You hurry. You won't have much time after my signal. - How long? 3 minutes 31, maximum.

Dan Geraldo won't be long, I hope, in joining us live from Chiquito, Palombia. Dan's not here yet. Meanwhile, I suggest you watch this first scoop, a report he made exactly 16 years ago. Dan Geraldo was in Palombia... Wait! I'm here! - This way? - Wait, wait, he's coming! - This way? Where? - It's fine, he's here. It's OK, I'm here! - Do we have sound? - You'll have it in 2 seconds. Dan, good evening. Good evening. Could you explain the state you're in? - Is he injured? Clarisse, I must say a word to my father, first. Papa, all I've done up to the present, was so you'd be proud of me. But, I must confess, I faked my first report in Palombia. I never went to Palombia. I filmed it in aunt Gaby's garden. Alone, with my V8. - I... you...as expl...sth... - The sound. The sound! ...Bolo, who caught us. (Russian) Can I get the sound which corresponds with the image? (The beavers will build a dam.) (See how they fidget.) (Little fidgety beavers!) I just wanna tell you, papa, today I'm really in Palombia. - Above all I have a real scoop. - (communication is back) My first scoop as a real journalist. Can I get a plug for my V8? At the foot of the volcano, El Sombrero, in Paya territory, is an immense... Palombian forest. And here, this extraordinary, little creature has chosen to live. An animal which everyone thought did not exist, but it does exist. I'm talking about the discovery of a new species, the Marsupilami. Why 'No tape'? Where's the cassette? Why is there no cassette? Where's the cassette? There was a cassette. Wait, huh? - We're waiting. Wait. We were captured by the Payas... Excuse me, I knocked it down. Who's this guy? - The scoop! - The cassette, here's the cassette. Dan, you are joined by?... - Yes. - By?... - Pablito. Hey kids, we're on live. Watch what's coming up! An exclusive for V8, the one and only, 'Images of the Marsupilami'. Watch. - That's me when I... - No, wait! (You be a Paya.) (Say something menacing.) - That's when the... - No! Wait. Clarisse, Clarisse, it's... A fake interview with a Paya chief. - No, Clarisse. It's not cued at the right spot. Gimme 2 seconds. Skip forward, Fast forward-skip. No, not the red! Not the red! Why did you press the red! You've just... I didn't press red, I pressed REC. He erased the scoop. If I press REC, how can I erase the scoop? - REC, is erase! - How annoying. Clarisse, yes... he filmed a Marsupilami. Look. Voila! These are Marsupilami eggs. It's an oviparous mammal. - Like a platypus, except yellow. - Voila! - Like that! - Voila! With extraordinary strength! Ok, that's a plush toy animal. We saw a real-lush animal. He lives with a Marsupilamette She makes little strident noises. - Houba, houba, houba... - Gni, gni, gni...&c... - Houba, houba, houba... - Gni, gni, gni... OK, control booth, can we run... - No!
