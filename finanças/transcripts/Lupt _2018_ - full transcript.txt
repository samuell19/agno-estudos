As you know we have brought the majority of the shares of Technocrat Company. That's very good news, sir. This merger will bring us a tax benefit. Our real estate sector is doing good business. Mr. Mehta? Would you like to say anything? Sir, the competition is very tough but... I don't want to give my competitors a chance. Tyagi? Tapan, touch up her makeup. Why are you looking at me like that? -Tanu. -Yes? Sam? What happened, baby? You won't mend your ways, will you? This is not right, Sam. Your dad is always upset with you because of your mischief. Nobody in the family appreciates my talent that's why I am going to the US. I'll be gone in two months and won't be back for four years. Thank God you are going. That's enough mischief for the day. Good night, Tanu. Get lost! Okay, sorry. She gets angry at the drop of a hat. Coward! What have you decided about the vacation, Harsh? Tell me where you want to go. All of us will go together. I don't have time for these stupid things. As of now, business is my priority. Sometimes you should prioritize your family too, Harsh. Harsh, this vacation isn't just for me, but it's important for Tanu and Sam too. Don't you think we should spend some time with them? Then you spend time with them. Who is stopping you? Here. Dad, did you see my new tattoo? Make a tattoo on your face. I'm sure there will be nothing prominent than it. Bye, darling. Stop the car! What happened, sir? Nothing. Let's go. Sunil, don't drive towards the office. -Take me to Gomati Nagar. -Okay, sir. Harsh, going by what you are saying, you're a case of chronic insomnia. Chronic insomnia. If having sleepless nights is a disease, then I've been ill for years. I am aware of that. Some people see things that others don't. But this could become serious. I don't have the time to take a break. You have to make time, Harsh. The coffee is good. I know you are very ambitious. All the psychiatrists in the world say, I am not just a psychiatrist. No harm will come to you. You know Sam is a prankster. You and Mom have spoiled him. That reminds me. Mom was asking about you. Mom always asks about me. Has he ever asked about me? He never even greeted me. Is he upset with me? Why do you think that? Did he ever say that? That's the problem. He never says anything... yet he speaks a lot. He gives me a look, and I understand that he's saying, Brief the HODs of Kumar Construction about our work culture. Sure, sir. -Inform Bakshi. -Sure. And listen... -Huh? -You were saying something. Um... Golf city project papers. Bring the papers, and I'll sign them. Hey, Vidya. Um. Are you sure I'll be fine if I take a break? Are you still thinking? No, uh... Well, actually... Good. Finally, you gave in. How could I have not? Our manager, Raghav met with an accident on the site. Tyagi, give compensation to his family. You will personally monitor all the departments till I am back and update me. Yes. So you've achieved everything. You are greedy for success, aren't you? Yes, I am. And every ambitious person should be. And I want to see where your ambition takes you. Look at yourself, Satish. You haven't moved up in life. I don't care for progress. Although I haven't moved up in life, my conscience is still alive. Conscience. That's good. Good luck to you. I've been calling you, Harsh. Are you going to upset the kids this time too? Sam, did you see my charger? Yes, I have. It's white in color. You are just impossible! -Did you take your inhaler? -Yes, Mom. -Please bring my bag downstairs. -Sure. -Yes, Tanu. -Rahul, where are you? I'm in the office. Did you really have to do this today? It's a moment of crisis, Tanu. Please get here as soon as possible. Bye. Is it important for me to come along on this vacation? Are you kidding me? Do you know how difficult it was for Mom to convince Dad? Since you are insisting, I'll come. You kept your promise. Look at him. Mom, I'll get something to eat. Come on, Tanu. Um, shall I tell you a joke? I'll tell you anyway. The joke is about a father and his son. So, Father. A father asks his son, "Have you ever done anything so that I could hold my head high?" What do you think the son says? His son says, "Yes, once... I tucked a pillow under your head. Did you forget that?" It's funny. That's how he held his head high. What happened, Dad? Did you not get the joke? Not a problem. I have one more joke. This one is world class. It's about an ant. Once an ant-- Dad, he won't keep quiet. Mom, please switch on the radio. Dad, can you please switch on the Bluetooth? No, it's okay. I'll do it. He's going to get a good beating. Hey, listen. Why isn't the traffic moving? A major accident took place. It will take around two hours for the traffic to clear up. -Two hours? -Yes. Where are you going? It's a long break, Tanu. I'm going for a walk. Are we going back? Will you shut up now? Harsh, what's the matter? I know another route. Let's take that. Which route is this, Harsh? There are neither lights nor signboards. Are we heading in the right direction? Yes. Mom, don't you trust Dad? Harsh, let's pull over and ask him. You may ask him if you want. Excuse me. Where does this road lead to? It doesn't matter where this road leads to. Where do you want to go? -Dad, let's move. -I will leave. What's the hurry? What's your problem? -Mine? -Yes. I don't have a problem. My car does. It heats up. It heats up at regular intervals. By the way, you didn't tell me where you are headed. -Well... -I'll tell you. Um... Would you please come here? Where is the graveyard? It can be anywhere. Maybe it's right at this spot. I want to get rid of a dead body that's in my trunk. Yes. What a weird guy! Quite an interesting man. You need to confirm everything with dad, don't you? He is my old man! Why are you laughing? Just like that. I think that stroller fell out of a car. Dad, let me check. Hello. Sam, what's wrong? Get up, dear! It's the limit! He's always cracking jokes. Do you think I'm joking? -Yes... -Move it! Get in. Why do you do such things? Rahul, who would keep a stroller... There's no cell reception here. Mom, I think he's still upset. He'll be fine. I know him. What will we do now? We've been waiting here for quite a while. And I don't see any cars driving by. No cell reception. Looking for the graveyard? Actually, our car broke down. Many cars break down along this path. Mine also broke down. I asked for your help. -Good. -What? It's good to say sorry. I've been trying to make a call, but the cell phone reception is terrible. You won't get it. No reception. Is there a garage nearby? It's just me here. I have a cottage. It's nearby. It's quite desolated... while I am away. Now that I'm here... If you wish... you can spend the night there. Excuse me? Only if you wish... Some animal must have had fun on the swing. They come here quite often. Why are you still standing? Please, have a seat. Thank you, mister. You did so much for us. I haven't done anything yet. No, I mean... My son played a prank on you. -I am sorry for that. -That's the bedroom. -Mom, I'll get the bags. -Hmm. You didn't tell me where you were going. I guess you'll spend the better part of your vacation here. The cell phone reception here is terrible. Do you have any suggestions? If someone could help me fix my car? There's no help nearby. That's the problem here. Your cottage is located in such a deserted area. -Do you live alone here? -They don't let me. -Who? -The people. -Oh. -Different types of people. The animals are frequent visitors these days. Hmm. So the bird fled. It had to flee someday. Are you sleeping well? What? Hmm. You shouldn't have scolded him. Let's wait until morning before taking a decision. What are you doing, Sam? Tanu, the doll... There was blood on... my fingers... The doll was bleeding. You got a tight slap from Dad. Still, you didn't mend your ways. Tanu, I'm telling you-- Look, the doll... Sam won't mend his ways. -What happened? -He says that a doll was bleeding. It's all a buildup, Tanu. He's definitely up to something. Dad is also upset with him. He's a kid. He likes to entertain people. When we're staying in someone else's cottage! Who will knock some sense into him? I am also pissed now. You look beautiful when you are pissed. Sam? What are you doing, Sam? Sam, what are you doing? Everyone will die! "Everyone will die!" "There's a dead body in the trunk." "Where's the graveyard?" What do you do? Look, I am not in the mood to talk. What you did just now... I didn't like it. I told you, I am not in the mood to talk. I don't want to talk to you. -How old are you? -I don't want to talk to you! Don't you get it? I am talking to you, Sam! Sam, wait. Will it make any difference? Please, forgive him. He is a kid. Wait. Why are you doing this? You started pissing everyone off just because you got slapped. I am not doing anything. I don't know what's going on here. Don't you think you're pushing things too far? Believe me. Something is wrong with this place. I don't know how the stroller ended up in the middle of the road. I saw a doll at the cottage. It was bleeding. There was blood on my fingers too. But it disappeared all of a sudden. I told Tanu about it, but she thought I was fooling around. Rahul, believe me. I don't want to be here or go on vacation. That's a nice story. Tell me, what are you up to? I'm not fooling around. Please! I know. You don't fool around. You are a serious person. Listen to me. Please. The car is working. The car is working. Did Sam come back? No, but Rahul went out to find him. He must be around. Let me check. Where's Dev? We need to leave immediately. But Sam is missing. Dad, I am scared. What happened, my son? What happened, my son? What's wrong, dear? Please, dear! Please call an ambulance. You'll be fine, dear, please! -Wha... Hello? -Sam! The woman says her child... -No cell phone reception! -Sam! Tanu! It's okay, son. Tanu, control yourself, please! Tanu, dear, it's okay. Tanu... Here. What happened, son? Who did this to you? Sam, dear. -A girl... -Yes. Which... which girl, son? No, no, son! You'll be fine. You'll be fine! Sam, what's happening? Sam! My child! -Yes? -Tell me! My son! What's happening? What's happening, Sam? Please forgive me. Wake up, son. Sam, don't bluff. It's not funny. You won't scold Sam again, right? See, I've told him. He won't scold you again. Wake up now, Sam. Dev killed Sam. He'll pay for this. Right now, we need to move Shalini and Tanu out of here. We don't have any other choice. Okay but... Shalini must not know that... Sam's in the trunk. I'm so sorry, son. Where's Sam? Where's Sam? Why are you quiet? Tell me, Tanu. Where's Sam? Don't cry. He'll come back. Dear? It's okay, dear. Give me the gun, Shalini. Where's Sam, Harsh? He'll come back. You're lying. You're lying as always, Harsh. The gun, Shalini? Why did you slap Sam? Okay... it was a mistake. A mistake. A mistake? It was a grave mistake. You thought... you could just pay your kids and be a good father? You treated your family like your business, Harsh. No feelings. No emotions. You were always selfish. Always. Never about the family. Did you ever think about us? You couldn't become a good husband... or a good father. Please give me the gun. -Where's Sam? -He'll come back, okay? -Get me Sam, Harsh. -I will. Get me Sam, Harsh... -Drop the gun! -... or I'll shoot myself. Drop the gun, Shalini. Where are you going, Shalini? Stop, Sam! Aunty, wake up. Wake up, Shalini! Dad? What happened? Nothing. Did you hear it? You've put Sam in the trunk. Harsh, get him out of there. Aunty, there's nobody in the trunk. He wants to get out, Harsh. He's suffocating in there. Stop the car, Harsh. Mom, please stop it. Stop. Or else I'll jump out. Stop... the car. Stop it or else I'll jump out. Shalini, why are you behaving like this? Mom, please control yourself. -Stop the car, Harsh. -Enough, Shalini! -Mom! -Shalini! All of you... -will die. -What? No, Shalini. No, no. Stop... stop the car. -What happened, sir? -Reverse. How can this be? What happened, Dad? We've been driving for so long... and Lucknow is still 145 miles away. Go back a little. The cottage again? We've driven almost 60 miles... and we didn't take any turn either. Many cars break down along this path. I haven't done anything yet. Dad... what are you doing? Drive to the cottage. Have you lost it? Who are you? The pictures of the murdered people in your room. And the murder instruments... -What are they all about? -You went inside my room? You didn't answer my question. Those pictures were a part of my research. You can verify them if you want. He's telling the truth. Ghosts, spirits, phantoms... I don't believe in them. My next book is about denying their existence. Is there any turn in the road ahead that could bring us back here? No. There's no turn ahead that would bring you back here. You left your baggage behind? Where are your... wife and son? How did it happen? Sam had told me... this was a bad place. Something's wrong here. Yes. Sam and mom tried to tell us something. Sam saw a doll and a little girl here. He did mention a stroller. There was an accident on this road two years ago. An entire family died in that accident. Including a little girl. A stroller... A doll. It was in the papers for so many days and... then it died down. Shalini and Sam died... because of me. What are you saying? It happened two years ago. Vinod Kumar was my biggest competitor. That night... he attended... a corporate party. What's caught your attention? Nothing. I'm just watching. I see. Kumar. He bags the best entrepreneur award again this year. You're stressed for no reason. Come on, this is a party. The newspapers are praising you to the sky these days. You've achieved so much in such a short time. What's the secret to your success? Life doesn't offer you too many chances to succeed. So I believe... you have to utilize your time prudently. Geeta. Uncle, it's my birthday tomorrow. You all are invited. I don't miss a trick when it comes to business. But Kumar is always a step ahead of me. I need the Brian Constructions contract and I need it bad. Kumar is also bidding for the same. Papa, when will we reach home? Very soon, darling. I'll make preparations for my birthday and I'll also invite all my friends. Yes. Riya will invite all her friends to her birthday. Harsh, you're drunk. Don't step on the gas. Relax, pal. Mom, you promised me you'd gift me a big teddy bear. Yes, Riya. Mom remembers everything. I'll get you a huge teddy bear first thing in the morning. Is that Kumar? Dear. Dear. Can you hear me, darling? Help! My daughter... You said... So? Kumar's dead. And so is the competition. -Don't talk rubbish, Harsh. -Help... Now listen to me. You should come along. Help! I left a family to die in the middle of the road because I was a selfish man. My family paid a brutal price for my misdeeds. Riya? No one's there. I just saw her. She is somewhere around. She's to be blamed for this. What are you trying to say? Are you saying... that a spirit is doing this? You're imagining things. Ghosts, spirits, ghouls. These are only stories. They are just not true. You okay, dear? What's wrong, dear? Dear, breathe. Dear. Just take a deep breath, dear. Geeta? Harsh, now you know how it feels to lose your loved ones. You took away what we loved the most. I saw my wife and son dying right before my eyes. Please spare my daughter. -Kill me instead. -I won't spare you so easily. You still have to witness your daughter's death. No... I want to see you writhe in pain. No... No... I made a mistake. I made a big mistake. Please spare my daughter. My daughter was dying. And I asked for your help. -You know what you've done. -I made a mistake. Please spare my daughter. No! Dear. No, dear. You'll be okay, dear. You want me to agonize over my daughter's death. What if I die? Dev Shukla Extinct
