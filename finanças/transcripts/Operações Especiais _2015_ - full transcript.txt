ONE YEAR EARLIER How’s it going? -Hey, Mr. Antônio! -Good morning! -How are you? -OK, thank God. How is your mother? Just great. -My bus. Can I pay you later? -No problem, Francis. Thanks, Mr. Antônio. Thanks, Mr. Leo. -How crowded! -Here, please. Have a seat. Thanks. So, your little boyfriend is late again? He’s not my boyfriend anymore. Mr. Tomás, I’m real sorry... The traffic was horrible on the subway. Everyday it’s the same. -I’ll be out in two minutes. -Yeah right, go on. Excuse me... -Good morning, ma’am. -Good morning! -Do you have a map of the city? -Sure. You taking the Embratur test? No way. I wanna keep on working with that asshole everyday, right? Everybody, on the ground! On the ground, lady! My baby! Shit man, you scared the shit out of me! Jesus, Robson. Aren’t you the fucking security? All hell’s broken out in the lobby. What do you want? For me to go face them all with this water pistol here. Is that it? Come on! Move it, bro! SPECIAL OPERATIONS The criminals took 35 people as hostages at the hotel. Negotiations to free them took two hours. Did you try to get in touch with the police? Listen, there were kids crying, me taking care of a couple of them... their mother too. I thought about calling in, but you know how women are, right? No, I don’t. Listen, buddy, show some respect. I’m doing my job much better, by the way, than you did yours. Let me ask you again: did you try to call the police? Isn’t that blond cop something? If I had a diploma, I’d take the Civil Police entrance exam next month. -To be what? -A Civil Police Officer, girl. -What kind of diploma you need? -Any college diploma. -Even tourism? -Even tourism, honey. Why? You interested? I can just see it. That two-bit Rottweiler in his suit, and you a police officer with a gun around your waist. The guy’d turn green with envy. They get decent pay? At least ten times more than what that asshole makes watching gringo asses on the sidewalk. Yeah, but I’ve never even held a gun before. I graduated in tourism. So what? Our president was a lathe operator. Just great! The radio, TV, all on. Hey mom, where’s my coffee? I have to leave... I’m getting it ready here, honey. And you know I like the diet cream cheese. I’m going to have to drink a smoothie again today. You’re not going to go to work today, are you, honey? -Today, tomorrow, everyday. -But, honey... There’s a war waging outside. They’re taking over the favela. The governor told everyone to stay off the streets today. I heard so on the radio. I don’t work in the favela, I work in São Conrado. And the governor isn’t my boss, mom. I work for some old English fogey who didn’t say anything about not working today. And what’s this about Mr. Antonio bringing you the Official Daily, with something about some police exam? Where is it? OFFICIAL DAILY CIVIL POLICE EXAMINATION FRANCIS CORREIA: PASSED Excuse me, thank you. ...and a car full of drug dealers has just left Vila Cruzeiro as it is being occupied by the police... This has something to do with that jerk Robson, doesn’t it? That jerk Robson... No way! I can think for myself, do what I want, right? And it’s just my test result, no big deal. I know you, Francis. When you get something into that head of yours, you go all the way. I know you, honey! Who says I’m going to join the police force, huh? February 2011 How’s it going? Just look at this, Teacher! Look here... The Police Pacification Units in Rio have caused criminals to seek refuge in other towns in the state. In São Judas do Livramento, two children were killed by stray bullets. The entire population is complaining... “Obsession” is nail polish for sleazy broads, Zaila. See if you can’t find some other kind of purple... Oh, but tell me. How’s my girl Katy Mahoney getting on -in her new job? -It’s nothing like that. -Thank God it’s just desk work. -Really? Not what you expected? Thank God. It's just the way I like it. For the population in general, the death of the children in São Judas do Livramento is just another example of the increasing criminality in the cities near Rio de Janeiro. It’s just terrible what happened to those kids in São Judas. -That’s for sure. -Seems it was some shootout between gangs... -Hello. -Hello, could I speak with investigator Francis Correia, please? Who is this? In name of Commissioner Froes, he’d like to speak to him. -This is Francis Correia speaking. -Shit, it’s some broad... Hello, my name is Sheriff Sales Freitas. You have been chosen for a special mission in the city of São Judas do Livramento. We don’t know how long we’ll be on duty there, so pack your bags and present yourself at headquarters tomorrow morning. And then some bum walked over to hold me up. Me and my girl... 9:30 at night, just making-out in the car, and he popped up outside her window. So I pulled out my 9 mm sitting on the console, pushed her back, and bang, bang, bang, three times, right in his face. You killed him? I don’t know if he died or not. All I saw was him stumbling back -and turning on his tail. -Shit. What then, man? And then my girl, you know what they’re like, right? “No way, I wasn’t born for this type of shit, I can’t go on like this...” All those things women say -just to piss us off. -They can’t take the heat, no way. I’d have done better to give the bum everything he wanted, my wallet, mobile. She’d still be with me. Everybody in town already knows we’re coming. I saw it on TV. And the bad guys watch TV, too. They saw it in 3D and HD. They’re all just drooling, waiting for us to show up. If we don’t watch our step, we’ll lose a couple men. Gotta keep on your toes. I was trained to not die. -I don’t know about you guys... -I don’t die, ever bro. Yeah, right. -The smoke bothering you there? -No. So tell me, honey, how long you been with the corps? I... Hey, this is the place... -Of course not, honey... -Good morning, officer. Yeah. Hold it a sec. You already talk to Tyrso, and Ari? -Right, around 6:30. -Excuse me, please. -Of course I am, you sexy lady. -Excuse me... Who’s in charge here? Hi, what can I do for you? Sorry ‘bout not.... No problem. I have to hang up. Call you later. There’s no sheriff here. We’re waiting for a new one -to arrive Monday. -Well, open the gates then. Commissioner Froes has just arrived. Today? Friday? Waiting for Monday is for somebody trying to quit smoking. Open the gates. Very well, men. Most of you already know me. For the newcomers, I am Commissioner Paulo Froes, and we are here on a special mission. You might not be aware of it, but you all deserve to be congratulated, because you have been picked from out of many to be part of this elite force. For what it’s worth... Our goal here, which we like to call our “Operation” is to drastically reduce crime rates in this city. If you only understood one word of what I’ve just said, that word should be “drastically”. And for those of you new to the team, it’d be wise for you to get used to my methods and rules. I want, as strange as this might seem, a police station that is 100% honest, and all of you to keep your records clean. Anybody pissing out of the pot will be sent home. As simple as that. We’ll be starting with the missions already set up for us by intelligence. I want to give priority to capturing the guys who shot those kids. Which will at least get the press off our asses. Commissioner, please, and what about the local officers? You’ll be the local officers now. Everyone else is coming from out of town. So, I want to speak to the local officers in my office. The rest of you are free to go. Chief, I’ve been in the corps now for only three months. I don’t have any field experience, that kind of thing. I think there might be some kind of mistake for me being here. There’s no mistake. Just orders from above telling me I have to recruit rookies like you, who have shown good results at the academy. But this is no reason for you to be treated differently than the rest. We’re going out into the streets. Things can get dangerous. If you don’t feel you’re up to the job, please tell me as soon as possible, so I can get a substitute. Women are scared of cockroaches. You tell me they ain't afraid of being shot? Women are meant to cook. Anybody who’s got an asshole gets scared. “Chief, I think there must be some kind of mistake...” Sounds just like her. I’ll bet you she won’t make it past tomorrow. Who wants to bet? I think she’ll leave today... That’s not her, no way. Yes, it is... There you go, minus 50 bucks for Ronaldinho. Not so fast, shit. The day’s just beginning. Here, my 50. Hey gal, the sheriff has a mission for you. But, I was going into the cell block to get a statement. -Can’t it wait? -Yeah. Let me get my gun. No need for that, you won’t be shooting anyone. We arrested this guy today and the sheriff wants you to keep an eye on him while we get his record. This jerk here. Keep an eye on him? But, he’s already in handcuffs. Too much for you? No. Just get him water, and take him to the bathroom. Only if he asks, though. -Right, no problem. -You can do that, can’t you? Good morning. You need anything? Everything OK? -Somebody, get him! -Get him! Get him! Come in. -Chief... -What is it, Inspector? -That prisoner... -What prisoner? The one I was watching. He got away. -I don’t know how... -Shit! -Where’s Roni? -I’m sorry, Chief. -He was in handcuffs. -You guys stop fucking around. Carrasco, I want Roni in my office right now. I don’t know how he got out of the handcuffs. Listen up, guys. I couldn’t find the escaped prisoner, but I did find my buddy... Roger! Took off like a bat out of hell, man! OK! All of you guys, face the wall... Back there. José Luiz, back up against the bars. We don’t have your statement yet. I haven’t given one yet, ma’am. Hey lady, I’d like a glass of water please. With all due respect... I need to talk to you alone. Is Toscano still working here at the station? He’s here, ain’t he? You have to help me, lady. Somebody has to help me, lady. Décio is a good cop for sure, but we’ve had trouble with him before. Come on Roni, we can’t do our job with just rookies and bureaucrats. I can’t take a 2nd division team and turn them into all-stars. Décio is good. You know that. He’s paid his dues. This girl too, she’ll be useful later on. Useful for sitting in front of a computer. End of subject, boy. Chief, excuse me... What is it? I need your signature here... We’re all filled up for today. OK then, thanks anyway. What are you doing, Soninha? No way the girl the whole town is talking about, is in my parlor for the first time, and we don’t have time for her? You gotta be kidding. Hi, how are you? OK. Thanks, but there’s a woman already in line. That’s Dona Mercedes. Dona Mercedes, you don’t mind if Soninha does your nails today, do you? With your job, you must think all men are wimps, huh? -Do you date officers? -It’s kinda complicated. You date store keepers? Bank managers? -Depends. -God forgive me, but if I had a man with a badge, I’d never go out with the manager of anything again. That’s all I need, to go out with some guy and then have to defend him? No way! -Good morning. -What’s up? -Want a lift? -Thanks. -Would that be yes or no? -Thanks "yes". -What’s the food like there? -More or less... We need backup on Seventh St. near the Canal. Patrol car under fire. Shit, the guy can’t even serve a summons without all hell breaking loose! 0346 on route. For Roni to be asking for help it must be pretty heavy. Everyone ready? Watch your barrels. Let’s go. Go! Go!. Hold on tight, guys. -Watch your barrels! Shit! -Sorry! This ain’t right. This part of town was supposed to be quiet. It’s Roni man, it’s Roni! Shit, hold on! Go, man. Cover me! Shit, man. Everyone alright? No problem, man. No problem. Easy to go down. Very easy. In more ways than one. -Pay up, ass wipe. -What? Again? -She hasn’t left, man. -These bills of mine are getting extinct, bro. One hundred? You sure I didn’t give you the money already? -Can I...? -Hey, look... Way to go, Negão! -I’m getting old. -That’s only you. I’m in shape. -Rosa? Everything OK? -It is now. I had to come down and get this beer belly out of jail, after running round town stone drunk... Oh, forget it. Let’s go, you jerk. -Bye. -Bye. Listen, the gas station on Bispo Street was held up and the Chief has given you the case. Now honey, the guy is already in the hospital, and the place was held up last night and they haven’t even filed a complaint. So you can take your time. I’ll go with you. Let’s go. ...around 11, 11:30 last night. And why didn’t you call the police? Well, I thought it’d be better if I talked to the owner first, to know what to do. OK, so you’ve informed him already? Yes sir, he’s been informed. What’d they take? Well, they only stole... They didn’t steal anything, just went inside, tore the place apart, beat up the guy at the register and then left. Do the security cameras work? -Listen, I’m not sure... -Yes they do, they all work fine. I’ll go over to the other side see if anybody saw anything. I’ll wait here for you. Let’s go take a look then? Hardly nobody around last night. I closed early. -What time? -Around ten. -On a Friday night? -Yeah. That’s life, I guess, huh? I’ll be needing your name, address and phone, please, ma’am. Gina Penha da Mata, Street 7, Lot 10, Resurrection Housing Complex. Don’t have no phone yet, though. If you need anything and can't find me at the station... You can reach me at this number. -Right. -Thank you then. I think it would be convenient to talk to the owner first. Listen buddy, I think it would be convenient for you to make things easy for me, so I can do my work better and quicker. It’s just that I don’t have any authorization to give you those tapes. If I find that they’ve been tampered with, I’ll be coming back here first to talk to you. Even before this boss of yours you love so much. Hold it there... What are you doing? That’s not it. -You know how to use this? -Here... -Not there. -No, here, this is it. -To rewind. -AV1, AV1. There! Pause. That looks like a Glock. Go forward. There! Pause. What is it? That’s an AK. The same gun that killed the kids. The Chief is gonna like to hear ‘bout this. Moacir, come here please. Do you know that guy there? That’s the manager of the gas station. That one I know. The other guy. That’s Toscano. He’s a cop. He doubles as a security guard when he’s off duty. The guy that used to work here? -Give me the glass. -Thank you, lady. If it weren’t for you, these guys would let me die of thirst here. You’re from Rio, ain’t you? Some kind of prosecutor or something? You said you had something to tell me the other day. What was it? -Yeah, I got something to say... -Keep it down, please. I wanna make a deal with you, with anybody, I don’t know. You have to get me out of here, because if you don’t, I’ll be "suicided" in here, -Toscano will kill me. -I’ll hear what you have to say and then see what I can do. Toscano. Is Toscano still around here? I’m the one who asks the questions. You want help, you’ll have to help me first. What about Toscano, tell me. -I wasn’t arrested, lady. -You weren’t arrested? -Like I said. -What you doing here then? Toscano snatched me out of my drug hole. What’s the difference? He brought me here to get me out of the way, not to arrest me. First he went and took over my drug hole, the day the kids were killed. The guy’s taking over everything. He’s involved with terrorism, with the militia. -I don’t want you to let me go. -Keep it down. Just get me transferred. Like real far away from here. Because that guy is going to have me suicided in here. He’s already in control of the vans, the drug holes, gas and electricity, the whole bit. Go and ask around, you’ll see for yourself. You tell anyone else this in here? Who am I supposed to tell, lady? It doesn’t take much for you to wake up suicided in here, lady. You watch who you tell too, they’ll make it look like I killed myself with a belt, shoestring. I’ve seen guys suicided with dental floss, lady. Listen ma’am, don’t go getting a soft spot for that guy Mosquito. -He’s no good, a real lowlife. -Moacir, I know what I’m doing. Man, sure is hot. You plant corn in this town and you reap popcorn. Chief, I went down to the Canal area. I asked everyone about the guy with the gun at the gas station. Nobody knows him. Nobody knows anything... Everyone is deaf and dumb over there. Or else because they really don’t know anything. It seems that the Canal favela is run by some local militia. Headed by an officer who used to work here before we arrived. Which explains why there’s nothing about it in the records, and why Roni was given such a warm welcome. The gangs from Rio must be somewhere else, Chief, not there. This guy’s name is Toscano. I’ll get a video and show you. Thanks, Dona Penha. -Want a bite? -No, thanks. I don’t know how they can sell anything with a name like that, “Knee”. -“Knee”? -Lousy name. -Normal, I guess. -But tell me... The kid in the hospital, from the gas station... How is he doing? Broken jaw, sedated. He’ll only be talking in about a week. Kinda weird, holding up a gas station and not taking anything. -Sure is. -Sounds like some message -from the guys from Rio. -Sure does. Those guys are pretty stupid though, huh? Using the same gun that shot the kids? If they weren’t stupid, they wouldn’t be criminals, Francis. Bye, thanks! -Rosa... -It’s for you! I’m leaving. Here, you got so flustered with that jerk Roni that you forgot -all your documents. -It was as evident as that? For sure, but no problem, he was just as flustered himself. My! Those look terrible, girl. You have to come down to the parlor for me to take care of them. What’ll people say about me? When you’re on TV pointing out the stolen booty with those horrible nails. No way. Everybody just likes to gossip. About all the bad things, right? Nobody wants to say anything good about anybody else. Like any other place, including my neighborhood. -Put your fingers in the water. -Oh, sorry. Moacir is being really nice to me, you know? -Ahh, he’s a great guy. -He really is. And do you know this guy Toscano? -He’s a real asshole. -He is? What’s he do? You hear about the new TV series about a woman cop? Really? -You haven’t heard? -No, I haven’t. Alright, Dona Esmeralda! Dona Otília, I forgot to ask if I could smoke in here. You’re the cop, you tell me. I can’t arrest myself. -Good thing she’s got good humor. -Give me a cigarette, Décio? -I didn’t think you smoked, gal. -I don’t. What is it then, PMS? Francis, Dona Penha left this here for you. Hey! Dona Otacília isn’t going to press charges if you smoke inside. -Her name’s Ermenilda. -Whatever. That sourpuss who keeps complaining all the time. OK, guys. This tip off was given to us by a local named Maria da Penha. She's known by the very original moniker of Penha. This Dona Penha says that the two culprits hang out together, Keep your cool, ma’am. like a rattlesnake and rat. They both escaped from the favelas in Rio. Guys working for organized crime, sent packing by the PPUs. And now it is up to you all to run everything through a fine sieve to find all their weapons and eventually see if we can connect them to the death of the two kids. Put that down. Keep your cool. Game over! The police. Police! Freeze, buddy! -There’s only one, Roni. -Where’s the other guy? -The door! Get the door! -Get him! Get him! The next time don’t leave no girl covering the door. It’s gotta be a guy! It’s a man’s job. Shit! He left like a bat out of hell. He could've gotten out even in a wheelchair, Décio. Sorry. Froes would have killed us if he had gotten away. It’d be our fault... The press would’ve had a field day. And he was about to shoot too, only he took too long. If it weren’t for you Décio, the asshole would have shot one of us. Sorry. One thing I don’t get... The guy’s got guns, grenades, loaded with drugs, and if I shoot him, it’s all my fault. Here, drink this. And keep your cool. If you wanna break down and start bawling, you do it in your room. You hear me? -Décio! -What? Thanks. Unfortunately we can’t say that the case is closed yet. Our investigation so far has shown that the bullets that killed the two kids were fired during the confrontation between the suspects we have recently arrested and unidentified local criminals. Well, we would all like to thank the coalition of state and local authorities for their support and I can assure you that in no time the peace and quiet that you all are used to and are deserving of here in São Judas will be reestablished. Good morning. -Good morning. -Hi, good morning. Could you give me something for a headache, please? You guys are the cops from Rio, aren’t you? You arrested the guys who killed the kids over at the Resurrection, right? -And were you there? -Yeah, I was. You’re an example for all women. Mr. Alceu, the officers from Rio, look! I live in that housing complex, you know that? It was one big drug hole night and day, officer. The kids couldn’t even go to school. You should have seen it. You don’t know how important it is what you guys are doing here. You take sleeping pills? No. No? It’s easy when all hell’s breaking loose, Francis. But then after the rush is over, everyone is the same. You never really stop trembling inside. Yeah, but he sold you controlled medication without a prescription. I don’t follow all the rules blindly. Don’t believe in it. I was suspended for having released a kid who had been beat up by two cops. If he had died, it’d be just another statistic, nobody would have investigated it. But I let the kid go. Two days later he came back and killed one of the cops who had beat him. It backfired. What can you do? They usually don’t come back. The two assholes who killed the kids have spilled the beans. A whole contingency of bums have taken over Resurrection Hill. If everything goes according to plan, we’ll be able to clean the entire area of the scum that came running here from Rio. Francis, I’m driving. Carry this for me. Roni is in charge of those coming in from below, Carlão in charge of those coming in from above. I don’t have to tell you all to be extra careful in this operation as they are all hardened criminals and sleep with one eye open. Don’t forget that these guys have more fire power than the Luxembourg army, if they have one. No matter. Let’s do it. The police! I didn’t do anything, sir! I wasn’t doing anything! Go do it in jail then! Décio, up there! Up there! Go, go! For God’s sake, lady! Help me! I’m gonna die! Get me outta here! Francis, no! You crazy? Shit! We need an ambulance! There’s a man down, bleeding a lot! Francis, in my office. You know why you’re here, don’t you? What you did is very serious. An officer can only put his life in risk in very extreme cases. And saving a wounded criminal is not an extreme case. It is something that can jeopardize the entire mission. Let this be the first and last time you do something like that. -Am I clear? -Yes, sir. There’s something else. The town’s high society, plus the local business association and the mayor’s party, which I refuse to even say the name of, want to hold some shindig in my honor. Wow! Congratulations, Chief. Nice. Yeah, I am always wary of initiatives like this. Of course, I can understand. I’d like to ask you to go with me. You’ll be my excuse to not have to talk so much with all the local fauna and flora. I’ll owe you one. No problem. But, won’t your wife get jealous? She pretends she is, just to please me. We’ll fix your hair, something real nice. Even make you feel thinner... You know what I’m going to do? Something from the 70s with a flair from the 40s. I was so proud, seeing him on TV. Roni reminds me of those officers you see in American movies, you know? The other day we were walking with the Chief on the street and before you know it there was this big commotion. I looked over and he was arresting some guy for selling pirate DVDs. The Chief told him he was a good example! Right, a good example, for sure. But Rosa, is your boyfriend the dark-haired one? No, the husky guy, handsome. He was standing behind the reporter the day of the TV interview. -A real stud! -Stud? Where? Short and crabby! Tell that angry young man of mine I sent him a kiss. Only you would put up with that guy! Oh... How cute, the police delivering flowers. Isn’t that wonderful...? If you’re nice, I won’t tell anyone. -Is the air conditioning working? -No way. Please... -Here you go. -My God! -I think it’s got syrup in it. -And vermouth, I bet. Anybody who mixes syrup with vermouth should be charged with capital crime with no bail. No, don’t drink it. I’m going to send it off to be analyzed by the forensic department. -It’s awful... -For Christ’s sake. Good evening. We are all here tonight to pay homage to a man with unshakeable faith in peace and justice. A warrior unafraid of the violent threats made by criminals. Young lady, I’ve been with the corps for a long time now and this gratitude is not what it seems to be. In two months he has arrested those responsible for the untimely death of two of our own children. Please, Commissioner Paulo Froes, accept the key to the city as a small token of our gratitude. Thank you, all. Inspector Francis, you’re looking good tonight, congratulations. I’m sorry, do we know each other? -I can’t recall we do. -So rude of me. It is just that your work is more recognized than mine is. Claudemir at your service. Nice to meet you. Claudemir Toscano! Of course. But everyone notices your work as well. Such a hard-working man can hardly go unnoticed. Excuse me... Will you let me by or am I in the way of another one of your -deals tonight? -What’s that? Just let me pass, if it isn’t too much to ask. Sorry, forget what I said. I’ll just keep my mouth shut, so no flies can get in. -Chief. -Commissioner Froes. -Hello, mayor. -Come out for a little smoke, huh? In reality, I was thinking about stealing a couple tape players, but I stopped to smoke a little crack cocaine first. But I was already on my way back inside. Well, let me introduce you to City Councilor Pacheco. -Nice to meet you. -Tancredo Silva Pacheco at your service. Very respected man in the city of São Judas. Commissioner Froes, would you by any chance be interested in local real estate? Haven’t given it much thought, Councilor. Why do you ask? Well, our little community has a couple real estate enterprises planned. Like the two condominiums already being constructed. One of them is exclusively for our associates and friends, and totally free of cost. -Free of cost...? -Free of charge. It’s because the sales of one is going to completely cover the expenses of the other. Listen, Mayor, I don’t own any land around here. I haven’t paid for anything to be built. I wasn’t even born in the city. I don’t understand. None of that matters. You are an authority. And what do I have to do, exactly? Need to do? You don’t have to do anything. In reality, each of us does what we can for the enterprise. We already have a judge, a couple city councelors. -Businessmen. -Mayor, I’m real sorry, but I’m going to have to decline your offer, because I like living in my own apartment. I live in Copacabana. I walk to the bakery, take my dog for walks on Sá Ferreira. So, you can see I have the time or need to live in a country home. I don’t even have the time it takes to take care of my own apartment. Well, no need to rush things. I’ll give you some time to think it over. “Mayor, I don’t think that will be necessary.” Shut them up for good! I would have loved to see their faces. A toast! A toast to a mission accomplished! Here’s to you. -Mission accomplished. -Cheers! When we headed back to Rio, Chief? What do you mean, back to Rio? There’s still Toscano... The authorization for our return shouldn’t be long now. Authorization for our return? We’re going to leave? Even more so now that they know we’re not going to get involved -in any of their little schemes. -We’re not going to get involved in their schemes, more or less, right? We’re doing everything exactly the way they want us to. Clear the city of all the crooks from Rio, and for them to sit back and get on with business as usual. Yeah, and what if we clamped down on Toscano? They’d all fall like dominos behind him. And with this bit about the condo now, they’re all in it together. You can count on me. Because I’m screwing the sexiest broad in town. Come on Roni, show a little respect. She’s my friend. Are you jealous? I’m a married man, show some respect you too. I think if we clamp down on some of the locals, we’ll be able to do a lot of damage to the upper crust folks in this quiet little town. I’m up for it. -Me too. -Count me in. Here... Let’s buy beer with this, because it don’t seem like the young lady is going to leave, after all. -About time you understood that. -She’s finding her courage. How can I help you? Jacira Meliande... Floral arrangements and porcelain painting. That's my wife's side. Turn it around, please. Oh! Dr. Heraldo Casagrande. How can I help you? I'm here to provide my services to... Antônio Barbosa de Sousa. Casagrande? Listen, my public defense lawyer was a woman... What does this guy want with me? You sure? Maybe they switched and you don't know. Listen man, you asking to be kept in jail? Get out of here, shit. Carrasco. No, no, better yet, Canhoto. Keep an eye on that guy. Something smells fishy. Gotcha. -Hello! -Hi. What can I do for you? I was thinking about buying a house... Right. I have one I can show you. It's already decorated. We're going to take Pavio Hill, which used to belong to that Mosquito guy and which now is headed by that bozo Toscano. This guy frequents all the high society freebie bashes and smokes big cigars, but is just another two-bit crook. And I'll bet you my left kidney that all his henchmen in this drug hole are just like him. If we can get our hands on one of these rats, he'll spill the beans in no time. None of them are known for their loyalty. Take the drug hole and it'll take only a couple hours until the domino effect knocks them all down. One by one. -Police! Don't try! -Throw your gun down! -Police, police! Hands in the air. -Throw your gun down! Show me your hands, now! Who’s the boss here? Who owns this drug hole? Tell me, asshole? -There. That green gate. -You sure? -Of course I am, sir. -Anybody inside? Couldn't say. So, you take the lead then, you can be the first to die. Good idea. You can be the lab rat, asshole. Not so hard, you're hurting my arm, man. The bum is saying he's going to take the rap by himself. You think so? It’s all his. Brave little guy... Yeah, we need more men here. You are under arrest for intercepting stolen goods. Come on, buddy! I didn't know it was stolen, sir. -With no invoice? -Excuse us, everyone. And where'd you think all the stuff came from? It grew on trees? -I'm a hard-working man. -Me too, help me get my work done. -I'm part of the church. -And I'm an atheist. -Good morning. -What's this all about, bro? -Why the animosity? -I'm not your bro, no need for more deceptions in my family. Documents and license for the vehicle, please. Good morning, everyone. -Off to work? -That's the way to go. -Here's the registration. -I'm the one who asked for them... Thanks. What you got in that bag there? Your lunch? This vehicle isn't authorized to take passengers. But, I've been working with it for years. I even work for one of your colleagues. Listen everybody, sorry to have to bother you, but you can all get out. This van is going to be apprehended. Hold it! Hold in a second. Nobody has to get out. -Listen, sir. -For God's sake! I already pay my dues everyday, I can't pay anymore. Nobody here is asking for anything. But if you insist, I can... If you offer us money, I'll be forced to arrest you for trying to bribe an officer, sir. Just wait right there, please. Floral arrangements and porcelain painting. Are you kidding me, sir? What’s this all about? -What's going on over there? -Well Fran, the attorney is already here with a court order to release the vans even before we've taken the guys' statements. Moacir... Can you tell me just who that two-bit lawyer is working for? It can't be Toscano, must be someone higher up. You probably saw him at the party the other day. Senhor Tancredo, the owner of the largest public transportation business around. All his vans and buses are falling to pieces. Everyone calls his company “trans-jalopy”. -No, but they are all racketeers. -His company is legal, but he took over all the competition. Hired Toscano to fill the streets with clandestine vans and he's his only competition now. -What else does he own? -Nightclubs, restaurants.... -Nightclub? -If you can call it that. More like a brothel. He and Toscano and some guy from São Paulo are partners. This is the place. -Party's over, turn on the lights. -Police! Don't want no scandals here. Keep it down. Men on this side, women over there. There. Open your arms please, miss... Excuse me. No hurry. Feeling me up like that will make me fall in love, honey. Wait right there, please. -Let me go! I'm working! -I am too. No way! You act like you don't like it yourself. It's not a question of liking it or not. I’ll give you a discount, come on... Just keep moving, please. Hands to the wall. Spread your legs. Come with me. Strange, don't you think? What? Look. Seems one of the girls is missing. Can't follow all the rules blindly. I hope it doesn't backfire on me. This nightclub has been open for a long time. You call this a nightclub, is that it? And do nightclubs provide these services here? That doesn't prove anything. Just a napkin with prices on it. The napkin will be good to hold up the charges. You're just trying to find some reason to close me down. -This is absurd! -Absurd is that girl's age there. And look at the state she's in. Call Toscano to give you a hand. Chief! Hey, Roni! Isn't that Rosa's brother? Shit, it had to be Rosa's brother. Commissioner... The guy is everybody's friend. It'll look bad. Couldn't you just give him a good scare? Scare who, man?... You think I'm some kind of ghost? And this I took from one of the rooms, for evidence. Attorney Heraldo! What a surprise seeing you here again. I was thinking that it might be easier for you to just set up office in here. Put in a desk here, a file, you could even put your wife's porcelain on a shelf to sell. What do you want? -Excuse me... -Good evening, Commissioner. Good evening. Oh, you brought another court order? Please, could you wait in my office? We're kinda busy tonight. So, where'd we leave off? What's your name? How old are you? Where is he? Where? Take it easy, Dona Rosa. Your brother is giving us a statement. If you could just come with me... Excuse me. Roni, I'm here to get my brother. Where is he? I'll pay his bail... -How much is it? -There is no bail... What do you mean "no bail", Roni? There's always bail, always a way. -Are you my boyfriend or not? -Rosa... See what you can do, let me pay his bail and get him out. I haven't worked all my life to have him locked away for some stupid trifle, small potatoes. No, it's nothing trifle or small potatoes... We arrested your brother because he was with a minor. That's serious, did you know that? Minor, Ronaldo? Listen to me. She's a first class slut. Everyone knows her... Everybody's been there, taken her for a ride, like a bicycle. -Did you know that? -Rosinha, you're nervous. -Rosinha my ass! -Calm down, shit. -To hell with you! -I'm working here. -Try to keep it down. -Keep it down? Working, your little police job, arresting innocent people, is that what you do? You want to arrest everybody? Are you all crazy? Why don't you do this: build a wall around the whole city and lock up everybody inside. Because they're not all going to fit in here. -Rosa, try to calm down. -I don't want to ever see you again, or I'll kill you. It was a stroke. But don't worry, I'll take care of her these days now, and your neighbor said she'd help too. Mom... Mom. I'm sorry... ...so sorry. You look so lovely, honey. I miss you so much, mom. So much. How's it going? What, you here to arrest me too? Of course not, Rosa. I'm here to talk, you're my friend. Friend? With friends like you I don't need any enemies, huh? Excuse me. Hold on! What happened had nothing to do with friendship, Rosa! We're doing our job. To make things better for everyone. Going after the poor is easy, huh? Me... My brother. I'd like to see you arrest the big guys, the mayor. Did anybody get arrested on Flores Street? No, right? Because they're all in cahoots with the cops, right? No criminals there. We're investigating those guys too, OK? I'm busy. I have to close the door to my house. Rosa, is this the way it's going to be? Yes, and I'm closing the door because I don't owe the cops anything. If that's the way you want it, fine. Sorry, Dona Erme. Good night. Good night. Meditating? -Something like that. -What is it? Francis, why'd you join the corps? It wasn't because of some noble ideal, so I'd rather -not talk about it. OK? -No problem. What we're doing here is noble enough, anyway. Did you bet I'd stay or leave? I didn't bet at all. I graduated in political science. Imagine you as a politician, Décio. -What's so funny? -Shit! I spent my childhood promoting the son of my mother's boss for President. But his mother was ashamed of it, so one day she called me over and said, “Décio, why don't you leave Carlinhos alone and run yourself?” And it just freaked me out. I thought, “so blacks can be presidents too?” -Oh, you poor thing. -No, really! -Carlinhos lost his aide that day. -No more campaigns for Carlinhos. -You'd make a good president! -I think so too. -A real stud of a president. -But I think I'll be happy being -just a sheriff. -Sheriff, huh? Yeah. I studied law when I was suspended. I have my exam later this year. I think it'd be better if you didn't get so close with that smell of yours. I've had a couple drinks, I'm lonely, I'm single. -You like my smell then? -Pure temptation! You'd better go. Go get some sleep. Go on. Alright. Temptation is me in a uniform. You're crazy. -Stop it! -Not the gun. Don't play with that. Here, Chief. I got this at the register office. That condo is being built on government land. Good afternoon, gentlemen. How's it going, Moa? The last musketeer. How these guys from Rio treating you? Man, what's going on here? Looks like some funeral parlor. This place used to be more lively. And Sandra, your wife, how's she coming along? -Fine. -Great. -Sandrinha's doing fine. -Good to hear. -And you, Toscano? -I'm fine too. I was just in the vicinity and thought I'd drop by to congratulate everyone on their work. Roni, is that you? No, that's me. Hey, senhor Roni. I came to congratulate you personally. Nobody's ever swept up Rosa's beauty parlor quite like you. But listen, you take good care of her ‘cause her brother's my buddy. As you well know, your buddy is being held here. And you don't have to go brown-nosing me, because she isn't my girlfriend anymore. What is going on around here, Moa? Everybody got PMS or something? We're working. You need anything? -What can I do for you? -You kicking me out, boy? No. Nobody here is kicking you out. Here, have a seat. You can use this computer here. But, it doesn't have Orkut! But, that one over there, you can play solitaire on that one. -Solitaire, huh? -Yeah. What's your name? Why do you ask? No nothing, “why do you ask”, just curious. So bye then, “why do you ask”. Moa. Toscano. Holy shit. -So that's why Toscano... -A rat. They cut his tongue. They parked back there, dropped the body and then left. -Did you see in which direction? -That way. Do you remember what kind of car it was? I don't know the car, sir. But I did write down the license plate. The car belongs to Valnei Jr. He's already involved in three inquests and does odd jobs for Toscano's security company. He'll obviously say that he knows nothing about his employee's past. We don't have anything on Toscano as we ourselves are witnesses to his whereabouts when the crime was committed. But the car is registered as a service provider for Town Hall. A good enough reason for the Justice Department to authorize a more thorough investigation. -When you finish, call that... -Dante Bicalho. ...Dante Bicalho and ask him to issue a summons for that half-ass lawyer with the porcelain because, after all, they murdered his client. And when it arrives you have it delivered to his wife's flower shop. What do you want, Francis? What do I have to do? -Sign that. -Sign where? -Well, I’m leaving. -Go on. -What am I signing here? -It's a request to halt the work on the condo being built on government property. Let’s put an end to this circus. -Hey, gal. -What? Domestic violence. Carrasco ain't here, so I'll be going with you. -Vanderlan da Silva? -That's me. What you want? I'm taking you down to the station. -Who's taking me? -I am, asshole! For attempted murder. Stand up. -Do you have any idea who I am? -Yeah. You ain't taking me to no fucking station, you get me? I'll leave if a policeman comes and talks to me. That's no problem, there's one right there. -Oh, a real male cop? -Yeah, a male cop. Hands behind your back! Everyone can get back to their beers. Relax. If you behave, we'll only be taking him down to the station. Not so fast. Eyes ahead. You're going to jail and will never touch your wife again. You hear me, asshole? Open it. Go on, get in! Shit! Shit. Everybody's a town councilor now? -And their kids, too. -Come on, get out. Jeez, look... What the hell? Some Voodoo ritual? Of course they're boycotting us. And you have the power to intervene. The neighborhood is lit, damn it. Oh, thanks a lot. The electrician’s here. Sorry it took me so long, Sheriff. There are no buses over where I live. I don't know what happened to all the vans in this city. I can imagine. So, is the problem inside the station? Everything looks OK to me. There's no electricity coming in from the street. Good evening. Only if it is for you. I received a summons. But, I’ll come back later. It seems you're out of electricity here, huh? If you think it's so funny, you can stay and take part in the circus... Wait in my office and I'll be right in to take your statement. And if the electricity doesn't come back in 24 hours we're going to have to let that animal go. Right, Chief? They think we're going to stop issuing summons and arrest warrants. In my time we didn't have any computers and we still put a lot of bums behind bars all the same. Moacir, isn't there a storage room around here somewhere? This is it. OK then. Everyone grab a machine, wipe off the dust and let’s get to work. I don't know anything about what the councilmen might say because government property and real estate is never.... But I've never heard anything. I don't have the slightest idea. He had some contacts over in São Paulo. -Commissioner Froes! -What is it? -They want to close my hotel! -Now why didn't I think of that? My hotel is the best one in town. If I’m not up to date with all rules and regulations, none of the others are either. Why they closing just mine? Because that's the law. It's not my fault. You’re not going to close down jackshit. And who might you be? Fortunato Seixas, Inspector for city hall. Very well, senhor Seixas, there's around twenty officers living in the hotel, all trying to uphold what you call the law in this hick town you call a city. If they don't sleep in the same bed they slept last night, I can guarantee you that they'll all be sleeping at your place. Are you threatening me, commissioner? Threats are for when you don't plan to follow throught with them. I am making a promise, as well as asking you to leave. Otherwise I'll have my men go snooping into your life so bad, that they'll find the check you bounced when you were 18. The one you wrote to that transvestite. I'm sorry, but I can't leave before... You're not sorry and you can and will leave. And go tell that jerk from the City Hall who sent you here that I'm going to do the same thing to him if it isn't happening already. Now please leave because I don't have anything more to say to you. Good night. Yeah right. Let's go. Dona Ermelinda, you'll have to excuse me, but I am completely fed up. Good afternoon. More than 400 lawyers inside the station. All working for some asshole. What in the world is a preventive habeas corpus, for God's sake? I've never heard of one of them! Everybody was padding us on the back in this shithole just yesterday. And now this! -I think that we... -Let's do it then. You want to get the guys, I'll help you. But it has to be now, because they'll be sending us back to Rio real quick. Good morning. -Police. -But I don't... You don't, but your husband does. And he's about to spend years inside some dirty jail to protect his boss. And you'll have to go visit him every Sunday while he wallows in the grime. And that is why I think it'd be wise if you told me who pays his salary. Who pays off the judges in this town? Officer, I can't. You said something, but I didn't hear you very well. My husband, he's a lawyer. He works for town hall. I'm not joking! Shit! I'm not playing any games here! I am fed up with all the corruption going on in this town! They killed two kids and nobody said anything. Don't you feel a bit responsible for that? You're as much to blame as all the others are. You'll understand right now what I mean. I'll tell you! -Speak up. -I'll talk! We do only what they tell us to do. Tancredo, he's the one who pays for it all. My husband only obeys orders. I cash checks, but I don't get any of it, I swear. I swear. You don't get any of it. -Try to calm down. -I'm not calm! I haven't been calm in years. I don't want my name involved in all this shit. But it already is. I'm going to get something to eat. You want anything? Thanks. He had a daughter. I didn't know. What is she going to do with no father now? People have kids, Francis. Criminals have them too. We just don't think about it when we shoot them. That's the way it is in war. I should have done something to stop him from going haywire in that flower shop. He had a fit, broke everything. Francis, being a cop is a profession. It's no character we play. We're only human. We make mistakes, we get some right. Or at least try to. So, where does the problem lie then? It all can be summed up in two words “public administration”. Only it seems that here the two words just don't fit into the same phrase. So, there's no way out, is that it? Who in the world is ready to uphold the law strictly according to the book? Justice is blind. Maybe that's the reason. She didn't read the goddamn thing. Promise me we're going to get these guys, Chief. I promise you we'll get them. This condo being built on government land isn't going to be easy for them to explain. As soon as we get their bank information, we'll be able to arrest them. But I can't guarantee just how long they'll spend in jail. Nobody can tell you that. OK. Rosa, that's not true. I called you up. I don't know how many times... Alright. But, what do you want? OK. Good luck! Take it easy... Easy my ass. I'm the one with the gun here. -You just shut your mouth. -Put the gun down. I'm going to put a bullet in your head, that's what I'm going to do. Police! Cover me. Go. Go. Circle around back. Go! -I'm going! -Around back! Go! Go, Francis! Face down. So you wanted to kill us cops? Face down. Don't move or I'll blow your brains out! Shoot! Go on, shoot me! Shit! Shut up! Just because I killed your little black boyfriend? Shut up! Take me to the hospital, shit! I've been shot. Don't you guys do everything according to the book, huh? Shit, where you taking me? The son of a bitch knew you were going to stay. What? Décio. He bet that you'd stay and that you'd make the grade. What the fuck? Down with the police! Go home! Get out of the way. No way to get through with the car. -Why not? -Leave it here, Roni. -What's going on here? -You complaining? -Sit in your seat and shut up! -Moacir, keep your eye on the car. Let me by... The Civil Police from Rio, who despite their impeccable work early on in their mission, have just been sent back home by the state governor after three months of hard work. The involvement of one of the police officers with drug and gun trafficking has just been confirmed. Décio Assis Ferreira, recently buried with honors, had already... Take it easy. ...been suspended in the past and was killed during a shootout. The state justice department has consequently decided to dissolve the Task Force from Rio. Back to you, Ricardo... -Don't go freaking out... -Did you hear what he said -about Décio? -Let it go. People don't want honest police. But I am not going to give them what they want. That makes two of us then. I'm sorry, but the way things are now... I'm not ever going to be able to go by the book, no way. We have Toscano outside in the car. We can take him to Rio and arrest him there. No way I'm going to leave that motherfucker here. No problem. January, 2015 What's for lunch? No, no. Make pot roast. No problem, I'll go by the store and then to your place for lunch. -Excuse me. -No, not that. -Make the usual thing. -Excuse me, officer. Stick in a couple potatoes with oregano. Right, I love that. Who's in charge here, please? We ain't got no sheriff here right now. We're waiting for a new one -to come in on Monday. -And till then you let the flies -take over, is that it? -What's it to you? Everything.
