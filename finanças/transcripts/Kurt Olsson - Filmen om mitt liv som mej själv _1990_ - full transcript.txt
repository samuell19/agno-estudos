Kurt Olsson The Film of my Life Kurt Olsson The Film of my Life as Myself Come on, Kurt! Come on come on— ♪ Now that time is long gone ♪ ♪ I look at his photograph ♪ ♪ His trousers too long and his shirt too tight ♪ ♪ His shoes too long and his hat too tight ♪ ♪ But it does the same—♪ - Olsson! It's for you. Well, Mrs Olsson can help herself a bit too. Kurt! Hello! Her waters have broken! I can't cope any more. - Now we've got Olle trailing through with his bike! Typical! - Asta's howling like a monkey and you're off riding your bike! - Nag! Nag, I said. Still no sign of Kurt yet? - No, Mr. Olsson. Kurt doesn't seem to want to come out today. - He has to come now! - Tell him, Olle! - Kurt? You hear what mama's saying? Come on out now! - That won't work, he doesn't want to. - Come on, little Kurt, come on! - You get out of the way, then he'll come out. You're scaring the child. - What a nag! - Goodness me! Look—here he comes! You dropped Kurt! - Dropped him? Not me! - I saw you! - The radio people are here! - Gothenburg-Motala. I am now in a living room in Majorna in Gothenburg. A child has just come into the world, and from what I understand— it's the first child born in this new time of peace. Now, Mr. Olsson, what's the boy's name going to be? - Kurt, Kurt Olsson, after me. A big moment, Mr Olsson. We have a new society to build. Little Kurt will be an important cog in the great social machinery. - This child of peace, born into happiness, has a brighter future to look forward to. - Look, Olle. How lovely Kurt is! Hurry up so you're not late for school, Kurt. Kurt! Stop and listen to me! Look out or there'll be a crash and a bucket to collect the blood in. Kurt, come here, - What are you doing? - Changing the air on the Head's bike. - I think you're doing something naughty. - Don't be so boring, Kurt. Join in the fun sometimes. - Boring? I don't think the Head would like cycling home with no air in his tyres. - Anyway, I'm going to be a monitor when I grow up. - You can turn it back on and keep the Rector happy. - I always have to do everything myself. It wasn't me, it was the others! I was putting the valve back in! - Oh were you? Good morning, Miss Larsson. - Good morning, Headmaster. - This fine gentleman needs a home report. He's been amusing himself by sabotaging bicycles! Good morning, Miss Larsson. - Good morning, Rector. Kurt, go and sit down. Who was giggling? There should be no giggling in this class. As you've probably noticed, today we have a new classmate in the class. His name is Arne Nyström. Please stand up, Arne. Now, so you understand, Arne is from Dalarna. Where is Dalarna? Kurt? - Is it in northern Skåne? - No, Kurt, actually it isn't. Does anyone else know where Dalarna is? Gudrun? - Dalarna lies at Sweden's heart. Dalarna's mountains are brightest white. Among its forests' rustling trees, there the Dalarnians sow their seeds. Dalarna borders Värmland, Västmanland, Gästrikland, Hälsingland, Härjedalen and Norway. - That was good, Gudrun. Håkan! Leave her alone! Arne, as you understand, comes from far away, and so he doesn't speak in the same way we do. And that's nothing to be ashamed of. Arne, say something so we hear how it sounds. - Can I sit down now? - Stop giggling! I said no giggling in here! Get out the garlands you started yesteray. Kurt and Arne can get out the bear glue and scissors. And Håkan, don't eat your bear glue again today. Now we carry on making every little part— of the giant garland that will adorn our classroom— by the end of the school year. Miss, my glue is finished. - Kurt and Arne, collect all the tins and scissors and put them away again, - It makes no difference that you're from Dalarna. - That's really good. How do you manoeuvre it exactly? - Get inside, boys. You can't stand out here. Take it easy here, there are prams and things that have to come off. No candy floss up on the trolley! You stay where you are. Get the package in so we can get moving Everything will go in if only you use a little imagination and think positive. What are you doing! Didn't I say no candy floss in here! Get those out again so we can get the package in. What are you doing, Holmberg? Have you gone crazy, Holmberg? - We have a timetable to maintain. "We have a timetable to maintain." You don't start until I've rung the bell. Good morning, Pastor, - Make the best of it because there may be no more trips for the pastor or for any of us— - You're such a nag! - What d'you mean, nag—? - You're worse than these chickens here. - That's my dad. He's a conductor. - That's unbelievable. - Well well, little Kurt. So you made it then? Go back home to your Mum. It's all over the place here. - Yes, it's all over the place here. Hello, Kurt. - Hello. - So you've got a friend with you? - Yes, his name's Arne. We've something to take care of in my room - Arne Nyström. - Auntie Asta, Kurt's Mum. Hello. - Good afternoon. - Don't you want some chocolate? - Later. Come on, Arne. I'm going to convert my father's broadcast radio into a broadcast radio transmitter. - Does he know you've got it? - No, he hardly ever listens to the radio. And then I'll convert it back when I've finished. - Come on, boys! Chocolate's ready. Hi, Olle, how's your day been? - What do you think? Same as usual—a godawful mess! - There's no order in that transport agency. - You toil and slave away there. You shouldn't let it wear you out like that. You'll get no thanks for it. - There 's a number 3 coming before a number 4! - Can't you relax for once? You don't have to sit at the window again tonight counting all the trams. - No, tonight they'll have to do without my help. I'm going to have a real radio night, Asta. They're broadcasting the match between Sweden and England direct from Stockholm. - I think we should go now. - Come on, Arne. - Maybe I'll sleep over at Arne's tonight. - Be careful not to get your feet wet. - Isn't it lovely Kurt has finally got a new friend? - Nag! Go and warm up the radio. It's starting soon. Thank you, thank you, thank you. We thank our girl band The Bluebells. - Thank you Elisabeth, Mia, Vanja, Sara and Gudrun. And now a short break while Kurt and Arne set up a song they made themselves. During the break, I think all you parents shouldn't stay in alphabetical order. So it's easier to get to know each other. - Nyström. - Olsson. - Olsson. - We can say du, can't we? - Olle. - Thanks Einar. Thanks. - Asta. - Thanks. - Einar. - Thanks. - Hi. -Thanks. - Thanks. - This is Arne's father, I understand. - Yes, I am a widower. - Sorry. - That's absolutely fine. - You always have to embarrass yourself! Thanks. - Hello. - Hello. - Kurt and Arne. Are you ready? What have you done with the map? - It was Arne who knocked over the map. - Hurry now. Everyone is waiting for you. I did think he'd be a tramway inspector. But he's going to be an engineer. - Now we can start again. Bluebells, please. And now I think we should give Kurt and Arne a really big round of applause. I have no idea what they've come up with so it's just as exciting to me. Nag! - I am a parasol mushroom. - And I'm a false morel. I was going to start by singing a little song. - Bluebells, can you play? - Stop giggling! ♪ You hear the same tune everywhere ♪ ♪ That the country is worse than the city ♪ ♪ But only they can praise cities ♪ ♪ Who are not used to anything else ♪ ♪ For me, I get anxious to look ♪ ♪ On streets, chimneys and houses ♪ ♪ Because I'm a farmer's girl ♪ ♪ Who loves her farmer's house ♪ Thank you so incredibly much. I thought we should make a small bedside lamp that you can keep in the summer cottage. - We don't have a summer house. - But those who have. Arne, turn on the light. While we wait for Arne, I thought we— should cut some holes in the cone I made in advance. Arne, hurry! So we do it like that. Like this and like this and like this. Hold it up so we can see. Look how cosily it burns. I knew it, Asta! Do something! I'll take charge! I'll take charge! Stay in your seats! There's no reason—! I have full panic of the situation! Stop! Don't you run away, Einar! Get the fire extinguisher instead. - Women and children will be saved first! - Help is at hand. Quiet! No panic. - Follow me. The exit is forward in the tram. Stop spraying! Stop spraying. Einar, yes—correct. Einar, Widower Nyström—! Who told him to get the extinguisher? Wasn't that me? Do calm down, Olle. - What d'you mean calm down? - He'll have a high fever the way you're going on. Fever peak—! Come in as a mushroom and then set fire to the whole school. Kurt, will you ever grow up? - Yes, of course I will. Can I make a call? - There's always a lot of calling in this family. - Let him call, Olle. - Nag. Sure, just call! But speak quietly. Maybe you've noticed that I actually listen to this program. - Watch. - What? - Watch, it's called, - What's called Watch? - The TV. - The TV's called Watch?! - Kurt means that you watch TV, not listen. - You listen to what Baehrendtz is saying, right? - Is that Gudrun? Calm down now, Olle. - I want to talk to Gudrun! - Do you have to yell like that?! - Yes, I have to. Gudrun's grandmother is deaf! - Hello?! Sorry, is that Gudrun? I thought it was grandma. No, you're not like your grandmother, but I didn't think you'd come so soon. - Asta, I'm going absolutely crazy. I'm going out to count some trams. - But Olle— Yes, Gudrun. I thought I'd wonder if you wanted to go out and look at the satellite tonight. Are you? Are you going alone? No. No, I was just thinking, if you were going on your own— then if I could go with you, you wouldn't be on your own. Are you going to Gråberget? Yes, but then maybe we'll see each other there. Bye. Mum, a few of us are going out to look at the satellite tonight. - Be careful now, and don't get too close! - Nag! - Hello, Gudrun. -Hello. Hi, Kurt. - You're sitting here, then? Watching the satellite, then? - Which satellite do you mean? - The one that's coming. - Oh, that one. Your dad's driving then, is he? Hey, Kurt? Since you know so much. When will the satellite actually arrive? - When will the satellite arrive, Arne? - It arrives at 20.37 from there. Then it goes over the firmament where we're standing and disappears—there. - You've got your camera with you? Are you going to photograph the satellite, Arne? - Yes, my sight is so bad, I thought I'd take some photographs, so I can look at them at home tomorrow. - Here it is! It's coming!! - So come on then! - Move, Arne! - That's unbelievable! - What an incredible speed! - So what was all that about, then? A fart in the wind. - A fart in—Do you know how fast a satellite can go? - No, but I suppose you do. - Arne, how fast does a sputnik go? - 33,347.3 km/h. - Bet you're surprised, eh? - I don't believe that. I don't think the Russians could build something that goes that fast. -That was the stupidest thing— - Maybe, I say maybe, if the Yanks built one. - That was the stupidest thing I've ever heard. A typical capitalist statement. Come on then. Why wouldn't the Russians make it? It just bothers you that the Soviets are much better than the Americans. - Well—where's Elvis Presley from? - Memphis, Tennessee. - Oh really? You can ask a question, can't you? - Suppose you can. - But why should they bring the dog with them? -To see how he's doing, you understand? - But how can they see it? - When they bring it down. Are they going to bring it down now they've finally got it up? - No, not now, later! - This conversation is rubbish. And anyway, I feel sorry for the dog. Come on, let's go, Gun. - I feel sorry for the dog too. - Gudrun, shouldn't I hold your hand now so you don't trip? Bye, Kurt. Say hello to Dad. Arne? - Yes? - When's the next time? - It comes back at 12.16 on Tuesday. But of course it's not visible. - Pity. Crappy school! Go away! Just fuck off! Oh bother! Forgive me, Gun. But I'm so angry I can't see straight. - It doesn't matter. I don't see very well either. I bump into everything - well, stuff—things, you know. But Kurt, why— Why are you so damned angry? - I can't say. But I can tell you one thing. Not another day in this shitty school! - You're dropping out of school now—?! - Yes I am! - There are ten days left 'til graduation. - I don't give a shit. - You're going to be an engineer. - Yes, I will be too. I'm going to study at Hermods! - A correspondence course? Are you going to study at home? Alone, or should I—? - I thought I'd ask my father if he could help me. - You can't mean that. - Well, better than have them messing with my gym bag! - With ten days left, I meant. - No, I said! - No, no. Look— So—what are you going to do now, then? - I'm so bloody angry, I thought I'd better go to bed and pass out for a while. - That's pointless. You can invite me for coffee. - I don't have any cash. - I can—I can pay. - Okay then. - Here you go. Extra cakes for the ladies. Right. And what would you little seedlings like? - I'll have a cinnamon bun and a large coffee. - Will you have the same, Kurt? - I don't drink coffee. Do you have milk? - Of course we have milk. - Then I'll have a large milk— and I'll have a cinnamon bun as well. - A milk, a coffee and two buns, yes. - She's paying. Have you been to Tyra's cafe on Vegagatan? - On Värmlandsgatan? - Yeah. - No. - It's good. It's just shit. But wait, have you been to Stigberg cafe? What buns! What buns! They're this big! A real mouthful! - The gym bag thing— What was it all about, did you say? Please tell me, Kurt. - Milk—and coffee for you. - You know—I think they're just being stupid when they pick on you like that. Can't you tell me, Kurt? Just for me? - Well— I bring my gymnastics bag when we have gymnastics and sports and games and athletics. OK? So— Trousers, a shirt, shoes—rubber shoes, that is— and I also have a whistle in it. And today when we were supposed to have it— they took it from me. Not the whistle, all the other stuff. And then they— they put in— women's underwear. You understand. When I went to change— - Of course I understand. Lingerie?? Disgusting! But I don't understand why you have to leave school because of that? - It was the cup that made the last straw run over. - That's not how you say it? - What? Kurt—would you like to come to our house on Sunday for dinner? - What are you having? - Steak, I suppose. - Okay then. - Look. I'll kill him! A Hermod course! He's gone mad! - Stop it now, Olle. - I'm going to kill him, I said! Where is he anyway? What have I done to deserve such a son?! - They teased him with the gym bag. - The gym bag! Bloody wimp! A Hermod course! Asta, I'm going crazy. I can't stand this kind of thing! I can't take it any more. Where's the TV, by the way? - Kurt took it into his room. He wanted to make some adjustments. - Asta— I'm going to kill myself. I'm going to throw myself in front of a tram. Number 3. No. Maybe I'll use Number 4. - But we're supposed to have dinner now. - Goodbye, Asta. Little Kurt—what's going to become of you? Good day, I'm supposed to eat here today, Gun said. - Gun? Your fiancé's here. - Yes, Daddy. I'm just washing my hands! - Kurt. - Yes exactly. - And what's your name, then? - Kurt. - Kurt? Is your name Kurt? So is mine! Isn't that funny! - Welcome, Kurt. - Don't worry about Daddy—he's crazy. - It's the same with mine. - Kurt! You promised you'd cut the steak. - You didn't tell me that. - Mother means Father. - The steak? Hell yes, the steak. - Welcome, Kurt. Gun has spoken so much about you. - Oh really? What did she say then? - No, nothing much. Just nice things. - Oh Mum, don't say that! - And this—is Gun's older sister Berit. - My name is also Kurt. - Berit. - And her fiancé Bertil. - My name is also Kurt. - Bertil. - Rufs, behave! - Is it true you destroyed the headmaster's car? - No, I didn't actually do that. - I changed a puncture for him once. - At school they said the whole car exploded. - That was later when I lifted it down. - Are you interested in cars? - Yeah, I think it's pretty interesting stuff. - Right then. Time to—sit at the table. You can sit at the end of the table. Is that all right? - There? - Yes. And then Bertil. He gets to sit between the girls. And then Mum sits on the other side. Yes. Go ahead and sit down. - Yes. Here I am with the steak. Yes, you can start, Kurt. You're the guest of honour. You're welcome. Are you going to have a little highjumper too? - No, I don't drink. - Yeah? You're dry? Fine, then we go on to the next one. You have a small glass already, yes. Yes, so, yes. You're welcome. And now I get to have a shot myself. - Can you pass round—? - If I could have some meat—? - I'll have a small one. - You eat a lot. The meat goes to mom. - What? You have to pass the meat to Mother. The plate with the meat goes to Mother! - Oh really. - Cheers then. That wasn't bad. Well, Kurt—so you'll be graduating soon? You and Gun. - No, I've quit. - What a shame! So close to graduation. - Kurt may have other plans. - I 've quit school and I'm going straight to an engineering course. - What did you say you did, did you say? - I'm studying engineering. - And how's it going? - Pretty good. - Do you go to Chalmers? -I go to Hermods. -Isn't it very difficult studying on your own? - Yeah, it's— What? Well— Well, it— So I— I—I don't really know, because they haven't sent the first letter yet. - What? - The first letter hasn't arrived yet. - Bertil was given his engineer's ring last Friday. - Damn! Why must people always ring during meals. - So—you study by mail then, Kurt. - Hello. Kurt? - Yes? - Your dad's on the phone! - What?! - Grandma's china! - No! We're going now, Bertil! - It got caught when I tucked my shirt in. - Idiot! - I thought it was my shirt! - Amazing, Sis! What a guy! - Shut up! - It was when I had to go to the phone. Everything followed from there. I didn't mean it to be like that. - Stop laughing! Your dad's on the phone. - The bloody phone's hanging there! - Kurt! What are you doing? Kurt? Hello, Kurt. What are you doing here? - What? - What are you doing here? - You can't study all the time. Gotta go out and air the wings and hit some heels on the floor. Hello. Hi. - Hello, Kurt! How late you are! - Did you get here with your father, or what? - I actually walked here. - You'd look good with a cap like this now, wouldn't it? - A cap's a cap. It's what you have inside the cap that matters in cases like this. Hello. - Hi, Kurt. It's incredible fun here! And listen to the music these girls play! You got a cap, yes. -What? - Cap. - Awesome! - Arne. Have you seen Gudrun? - Huh?! - Have you seen Gudrun?! She's standing over there with Gun. - Hello, Gudrun. - Hello. - Hello Gun. Maybe I should say thanks for the last time. What are they saying at your house? - What do you expect? Mum isn't too happy, but Dad's still laughing. - Yes, it was funny. - Yes, it was funny. - Arne's got a cap. - That's even more funny. - Congratulations. - Thank you. - Look, Gudrun, I thought I'd ask if I could wonder about something. - Sure. - I was wondering—if you and I were ever by ourselves, we might dance together, with each other. Suppose we could—sometime. But now I'm promised to Kent. - So we can dance. - Yes. It was Gudrun I was supposed to dance with! It was Gudrun I was supposed to dance with! Okay then, but I lead. - Yes, yes! Go home! Does Arne have to be here? Stop imitating! It's terrible that you always pick on Kurt. - But Gun, we thought it was good. - It was incredibly good, Kurt. - I think I know what you think. Come on, let's go, Kurt. - What? - Out of the way! - Kurt? Say hello to Dad! - I don't give a shit about him. Come on! Thanks for the loan. You know, Gun, I thought I'd wonder— I thought I'd wonder one thing while we're still alone. - What is it? - Gudrun— Well, not Gudrun but Kent and Gudrun. Have they done it? - Done what? Oh. Yes, yes they're going to get engaged. - I was just thinking that— What about you? Aren't you going to get engaged? - You mean that? - What? - That we should get engaged? - That isn't what I was thinking of. - But it's what you said. - Is that what you want? - Yes, Kurt! - Well okay then. Let's do it. What is it, Gun? - Kiss me, then! - I have an awful cold. - Yeah, that doesn't matter. No! Kurt! No, I'd better get on my way and read some Hermods. Bye, Gun. Mum! All right, it's time to come home now. Mum? I've got engaged. - That does sound nice. - Well, you must be expecting a kid. - No, I don't think so. - So you're going to get married too, of course? - No, she didn't say anything about that. - What kind of idiot—well?— would want to get engaged to you? - Gun. - Ohh yes. Yeah, you're a good match. - She's a very nice girl. - Nag, nag, nag. Where are you going to stay then? - Here, I suppose? - What will you live on? Your Hermod course?! Are you going to stay here and live on your Hermod course? Asta, I'm losing it. Here it comes again. I'm going to kill myself now. This time I'll do it. I'm going to go out and lie down on the track. - Yes, you go ahead. Meantime I'll put the coffee on. - Mum—I suppose I'll have to get a job now. - Yes, that'll all sort itself out. But you have to do your military service first. - Yes. That too, yes. - Just be careful not to get shot. - No. I don't think so. Attention! Right turn! Gentlemen, we have gathered here for a short briefing— before the visit of the Congolese army chief and his staff. Captain Lönnroth, would you like to give a brief account of the route, timetable, etcetera. - Yes, Colonel. The visitors arrive at the airport at 16.00. Then proceed towards the regiment ... - Yes. Just one small detail. These two—Olsson and Nyström— Is it known where they will be today and tomorrow? - Colonel! - Yes, Captain Stålkrage. - I have already taken care of that detail on my own initiative. The two gentlemen will be eighty kilometres northwest of the regiment- on their very own manoeuvre. Olsson has previously expressed a wish to participate in a hunter's march. And I considered this a brilliant opportunity. - Excellent, Captain Stålkrage. - I love the military. What if one could make colonel, Arne. In other words, I'm thinking of enlisting. - Yes, it's incredible. Olsson and Nyström, can you take our watch today between four and six? - Sorry, Arne and I are going on the hunter's march. - Two hours? You can go on the march tomorrow. - Of course, it would be damned interesting, but I've never been on guard, Arne. Who goes there? Stop or I shoot! - Hello! - Check them, Arne! Identification! Welcome. - What's all this? - Halt! I'll count to three, then fire. Show us who you are! - I've worked here for 20 years. - Have you been working here for 20 years? Can you identify yourself? - Here, look. - That's it, yes. Well done. Now get inside out of here so we can get on with our work! - Yes, shouldn't we have Lönnroth here? - Here he comes. - Excuse me! Arne, get the binoculars. There seems to be a suspicious convoy of cars heading this way. - What the hell kind of idiots are on guard?! - Olsson and Nyström, I think. What do you see? - Yes, it's incredible, Kurt. The whole car is full of negroes. - Negroes? What kind of negroes? - Negroes in uniform—must be military Negroes. Run them over! - What did you say, captain? - Run them over, I said! - Arne, I think the time has come. Cover me. Cover me, I said. - Run them over! That's an order! - Halt! Or I'll shoot sharp before the count of three! We got one, Arne! Now get the next one. Drive! Identification! It's so damn typical. Just because you do it by the book, you get fired! - It's unbelievable! But what are you going to do now, Kurt? - Maybe one should get married. Yes, but I've never done that. - What about me! Yes, the clock is ticking here and I don't want to be long winded. Even at a wedding, it's important that the timetable is kept. But let me conclude by saying— that marriage doesn't always go like on rails. But two tram cars have been connected. With these simple words, I suggest— we shout out a hip hip, hip hip hurrah for Kurt and for Gun. Would you stand up? May they live! - Now it's coming, now it's coming! I won't say what, but it will be a surprise! Let us hope—it goes better—in the future. Here comes Mum with the cake! - Did you buy it at Bräutigams? - Of course! I'm just going to... - No, Mother! - And now our Per will read all the telegrams that have arrived. Gothenburg 6/6 1966. Happiness and prosperity your whole lives From your friend Knut. Axel and Ingrid. - Axel and Ingrid? - Yes, they're the cousins. - Gothenburg 6/6 1966. Hey, jump under the blanket, in nine months the baby will come. An unknown admirer. - So childish. - Yes, well, now there's another little surprise. From Mother—to the bride and groom, A gift from— - Hey. We can keep—we can keep it at home. - Cool. - Hello? - Should dad say something nice? - One last greeting— Why should people fight? Why should there be blood? Why should so many suffer? Only— - Cheers, Dad. Cheers, everyone. - Gudrun. - Yes, so now we'll all move to Biskopsgården. That'll be nice, we'll be neighbours. Can you turn on the light? I have so much to carry. - This is absolutely wonderful! - I'm very glad you like it. - Yes, I really do. You nailed it here, Gun. Where should we put the TV? - We'll have to wait 'til we can afford one. Let's take a look at—the other room. - Okay. Very nice bed, Gun. Why is there a roof on it? - It's a four-poster bed. - Those curtains, are they supposed to be up or are they supposed to be down or are they supposed to be either way or what? - You can have them any way you like. - Right. Yes, it looks good. - Kurt! - What is it, sweetheart? - I think I'll go and lie down for a bit. - You do that, Gun. You need it. Oh, Gun? - Yes, Kurt? - Did you buy milk for tomorrow morning? - Yes I did. It's in the fridge. - Yeah. I think I'll have a drink right now. - You do that. - Do you want some? - No thanks. The tuba— Hey Gun? - Yes? - I've just thought of something. You know the thing about the TV? You know, Dad's got one over at our house. I could bring it here. It doesn't work too well at the moment but I can fix it. - Kurt—? - What is it, Gun? - Aren't you coming to bed soon? - Yes. I might just do that. One starts to feel tired. Who the hell is the supervisor? - Hinken Johansson. - Johansson, come here! - The engineer wanted to talk to me? - What's that? - Yes— It looks like some new kind of propeller. - This is no joke, Johansson. - No, we really hope not. It's fun though. In other words, we only work exactly according to the drawings. It's none of our concern to interfere with how you work in the drawing office. - Yes, we are not the ones responsible for the thinking work. We just do our job. - Your job? Who the hell is engineer K. Olsson?! - Well don't ask me. - Engineer K. Olsson! - I have no idea about that. - Find out, then! Pull that shit down! Engineer. Shouldn't the engineer stop and watch it spin before he leaves? Start it up now, Proppen. Engineer? Couldn't you sell it to the dairy centre? The dairy centre—! Hello. Hello! Bertil?! Hello! - Idiot! - Do you have a problem, Bertil? Anything I can help you with? Good day, I'm Kurt Olsson. I have a meeting here with the personnel director. - So you're Kurt Olsson?! - That's me. - Please go on in. Mr. Olsson is expected. Director Olss— Director Lindroth, Mr. Olsson is here. Yes. Go ahead, it's this way. If it blows from there, it blows into that one— then I have to put it there. Ah here's Mr. Olsson, Mr. Olsson. Step inside, Mr. Olsson! step inside, Mr Olsson! I'm experimenting here. To test—to test the wind direction, one must spit in the lee. Yes, it's true. How does he like it here? How is Mr Olsson enjoying the yard? - I'm having a wonderful time! There's a lot of fine colleagues here and so— And I think I have a lot of interesting tasks too. That's what I think. - How long has Olsson been here now? - It'll be— It'll be—it'll be three weeks on Monday. - Is he interested in that perhaps? That's good, good. Yes. Yes. You understand that— You see. I have put in a tremendous number of working hours on that. Goodness! You mustn't do that. This is precision work, you see. - Yes, I've built quite a few models myself. - Have you really. I see— Yes, Olsson. A lot has happened in these three weeks. That propeller on 209. How did it actually happen? - It was my brother-in-law Bertil— - Engineer Börjesson, you mean? - Yes, exactly. Him. We work in the same department, he and I, so— So he had—yes exactly that— He had made a drawing of a propeller. And he said to me: Kurt, he said. Yes, I said. Can you go down and copy it? So I did that, and that's how it happened. - It wasn't that you—changed the drawing a little? - There were a few details I thought could be changed. - I noticed that, I noticed that. Yes. Then you signed the drawing with engineer K. Olsson. Are you an engineer? - I was registered at Hermods before my national service. - Yes— - So— So it looked better somehow on the drawing when I wrote engineer, so I—wrote it. Yes. - This propeller business has cost the yard a lot. Close to 1.8 million. And I have to say that unfortunately I don't find this construction useful. Because time—time speaks against it somehow. And then it's perhaps just as well to say that there are many forces pushing for Olsson to quit. - Not least engineer Börjesson. - Bertil! - Yes. Quite. Personally, I think Mr. Olsson deserves another chance. Careful now. - Yes. - Please Olsson, leave it there. Please leave it, I said. Couldn't Olsson go out? Please Olsson, get out. For fuck's sake, not that one too! But just one more chance! Bloody man. Kurt? - What is it, sweetheart? - What are you doing? - You'll see that when it's finished. Speaking of which, do you know what I got? - No? - A new job. - Have you moved?! - No. I was with the director today and he wanted me to have some more decisions to make. So tomorrow I start in the department that has the most to say about the entire yard. There, it's finished now. Do you like it, Gun? - Well—What is it? -A reading lamp. - Yeah. - Where were you thinking of putting it then? - In the bedroom. - Shall we try it then, shall we? - You're naughty! So what kind of problem do you have then? What can I help you with then? - I want the forklift there. - And what are you going to use it for? - What am I—? We're going to lift some stuff down on 207. - What kind of stuff then? - Just some stuff. I can tell you, it's so heavy we can't carry it— well, unless you help, of course. - I'm sorry. Unfortunately I can't help you. We don't have anyone in today. Next! - Yes, but, Kurt. It's right there. Bring the truck over here! - That truck should be there because it's possible that we need that very one! - But I have five men waiting! - Next! - Hi, Kurt. - But look here— - Hi Arne! - Do you have any pens? - Yes, we can always arrange that. Hold on a moment. And what's going on over here? - I don't have any badges. - Oh, I don't have any badges! - One who has no badges should have nothing. - Quite right. He'll get nothing. Out! Out! Out! Now, Arne, what did you say I could help you with? - Some pens, please. - Sure, we can arrange that. How are things at the payroll office, Arne? - Yeah, there are some unbelievably nice girls up there. And they're friendly. - Arne—tomorrow's our big day. Would you sign this? - Of course. It's going to be unbelievably enjoyable. - That was a damned good course we attended. It was lucky we went there. - Can't you get your fingers out? I don't have time to stand here all day. - Sorry, but it may not be known that tomorrow is H-Day. Thank you, Arne. - I don't have a car. - What are you going to do about it, then? - Nothing. - Thought so. Actually, Arne and I are going to be right-hand traffic switch security guards. And we've done a course for it. - Yes. - We're doing that to help you. - God help us. What is it? Morning. We're doing the right-hand traffic switch. Do you have a car? Where is it? Right, so we'll move it over to the right-hand side and then point it in—the direction of travel. - Now? - Now, yes! Right now. We have an hour. If we all help each other with this, we should probably be able to solve it smoothly. It's fine. Now the other way. - My God! Learn to drive, man! - It's fine. Yes. Come on. More. - Kurt Olsson— - Miss Larsson? Do you have a car? - A car? - Yes, a car. - No. I use a stick. - A stick? - A stick. - We're switching to the right, Miss Larsson. And that applies to all of us. No, the other way, I said! We're switching! From left to right! Stop! - What do you think's going to happen tomorrow? - We have the whole day tomorrow! What do you think will happen if everyone moves tomorrow? It'll be quite a complete mess. Move the car, I said! - You're a bit of an idiot, aren't you?! - Move the car! Move the car! Arne. Can we get the car in the direction of travel just once?! - I'm working on it. - Right, now I'll take the next one. - You're supposed to turn around! Over to the other side! Stop right there! You have to back forward! You go that way! Back forward! That way! Turn round in the direction of travel. This way. Get yourself in here!! Put it back, I said. Bertil, there's something going on in the street. Wake up! Something going on in the street. What are you doing down here?! I said you should travel in the direction of travel. - What the hell are you saying, Miss Magnusson? Didn't you hear anything I said about the direction of travel?! That means you're going that way - Drive over on the right-hand side. You've destroyed the community association fence! You've destroyed the community association fence! - I'm working here. It's my job. - Yes. I'm helping. - I'm in charge here! - I'm helping as best I can. - Now I'm going to kill him. Dead! It's Kurt! He's crossed a line this time! I'm going to kill him! - Calm down! You can't do that! - Come that way! Out of the way! - Bertil! Remember he's still Gun's husband. Bertil! What happened, Kurt? Attention, attention! The street is now subject to emergency powers! Can I ask everyone to return to their respective homes! Leave all vehicles where they are for now! - How is he? - Nothing to worry about. Oh, Kurt! What a terrible accident! Thank God you're completely unharmed. Fantastic! - Unbelievable. - Poor little Asta. - What happened, Kurt? I didn't see how it happened. - There was a truck or a big bus that ran over me three times. Then he reversed and ran over me once more. - Unbelievable. Yes, yes. It's the right-hand traffic switch. - Well, I thought you might be in hospital a long time, so I— so I brought my insect collection for you to look at, Kurt. - Thanks, thank you, Arne, but I don't think I can take it right now. -Asta, shall we say it? - You say it, Märta. Kurt, you've become a father! Poor boy. - No. It turned out to be a girl! - No, we've always had boys for longer than anyone can remember. - Can you imagine, Kurt! Gun's had a lovely, healthy baby girl a whole week early. And her name will be—Therese. Poor beautiful little new Therese. To be born into this earth of ours and become fatherless from the beginning. - You're coming home with us now, aren't you? - The doctor and I have agreed that we should probably keep me here for a few days. No, no. There's nothing wrong with you. That's what the doctor said. You can visit Gun and the baby. They're on the next floor! - I can't bear to go there. I'm here for observation. Say hello to Gun if anything happens to me, and tell her I loved her to the last. At least you can take a look at the elephant hawk moth, Kurt? - It'll probably be fine. - Poor Asta. - Be careful now so you don't get sick. Bye bye. - Kurt. - What is it, Gun? - You don't catch a cold from being run over. Aren't you going back to work soon? - I've been working. I made the cradle here for you. - Yes, it turned out very nice. - Gun? - Yes what is it? - I've started to wonder if I should think about quitting the yard. - What? - I've read so many medical books since I've been ill. I'm thinking about whether I should go and become a doctor. I have that old course around somewhere. Hermod - You can't just do that! Yes, it might be possible to exchange being an engineer for being a doctor. What do you think about that, Gun? - Nag! - Could you get that, Gun? Hello? Really? Are you from the radio? Yes? And what would he have to do? Is he going to be on a radio show? No, no, no. Why? Should he go babbling on the radio now too? No! He's going to—he's going to work tomorrow. I said no! - Who was on the phone, Gun my love? - Gun my love. Someone from the radio. They wanted you to be on a radio show. I said no. - That was very stupid of you. - What's this doing here? - Can't she have it then? I could become a radio or TV celebrity. Yes yes, what's done is done and will never return. Gun—can you heat some hot chocolate for me? Or milk or something. It's coming—there's going to be such a huge sweat now. - Can you pull the cord for a while so the little baby can get some sleep? - Just a minute! Hold on. What's all this?! Gun! Surely you can't say no to that?! You can't just put the phone down on the people from the radio! - You just saw I could do exactly that. I said no and hung up like this. - But—it's the film about myself as my life! They haven't even closed the yard yet. -You're stopping the whole development. - Has it occurred to you that I might not want that development? Idiot! - Was it you who made this up, Gun? - Me? I haven't made anything up. Shall I say what I think? I agree with Gun. - It's clear. You should stick together. - Now that's unbelievable. That's truly unbelievable. It's about time it was stopped. It would have been far too long otherwise. - What about us then? We've sat through the whole film and haven't been allowed to play a single note! - You certainly have! - That's right. I noticed it. - Yes, once, yes. - So play something now, if it's so bloody important! Crap! Think up an ending yourselves then! You who are so damn good at everything. I think this film should have ended before it started. Yes. Hello. Hello. I'm really unwell, and I have a cold, and I'm miserable. It would be good for me if we could end this. - I'm going crazy! Can't he do anything right?! He can't even get an ending to the film! - But Olle. We can't go when Kurt is so sick! - Nag! - Olle! - Shut up, I said. - Gudrun, don't you have a nice ending for this? - I think a film kiss would be nice to end with. - Yes, a film kiss! Then we can play something romantic. - Well, I'm so terribly snotty and disgusting. It's running—it runs all the time, so I don't really want to be kissed. - I suppose I'd better go and practise the tuba. - No! Go on and end it with a really beautiful film kiss. - I agree. Think Clark Gable in Gone with the Wind, you know. - Film kiss! Film kiss! Film kiss ... Calm down! Why is everything such a bloody mess whenever you're around, Arne! - Yeah— - We'll have to make a new film. - Film kiss! Film kiss! Film kiss ... - Calm down then! Stop your nagging! Women's orchestra—okay— play something romantic, then! Gun! - Here I am. THE END English subtitles by faxeholm1234 and jeremys TNT 2023
