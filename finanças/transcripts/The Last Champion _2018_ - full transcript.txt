John Wright is dominating at these Olympic trials. I do have one other announcement this morning with regards to an executive board decision. The American wrestler John Wright, he has been sanctioned by the IOC for failing an antidoping test. - Push off! - You better hit something. Get the leg! There it is! - You got him. - There you go! - Way to work. - Shake. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Hey. - It's all right, man. Scott! Scott! Any more challenges? What are you sitting around for? Move! Spin drills. Michael Miller. Yeah? You're under arrest. Turn around, please. What for? Come here. Come on. Give me your hand. What's going on, Doug? Carol? Ask him. Pause it! Right there! You see that? He's stealing it right there! That's $40 worth of New York strip! Who were these other boys? Would you wait outside, please? You both know what this family's situation is. I'll pay you for the steaks, Al. Hey, I'm tired of these punks coming into my store and ripping me off. Now, I want to press charges, Doug. Al, just a second, eh? We can't I.D. those other kids, and if he's not gonna tell us, there's not much I can do. Eh, well, I can I.D. him. Doug. He did shoplift, Frank. If Al wants to press charges, I can't stop him. What about community service? I'll put him to work at the firehouse. I-I want him to pay for the steaks, not you. So, look, you're gonna miss some practice. You gotta keep yourself in shape. And Scott's gonna wrestle Colfax this week. It's better than the alternative. All right, you report to Keith. He'll get you started. I'm sorry. My mom wasn't feeling well. I'm sure she'll be calling you soon. Whenever she's up to it. Hey, look! It's Terry Turtle! Joanna, get me a drink. Mommy, look what I made. Wow. That's pretty. So, Michael... you want to explain to me why you had to be picked up at the jailhouse today? Way to go. How do you think that makes me look? I asked you a question. - Bad. - Yeah. You know, Coach told us to eat protein. All there is here is cereal and macaroni and cheese. I see carrots on your plate. So you think carrots are protein? They're healthy, aren't they? What are we supposed to do, have tri-tip every night just for you when I can't even pay the important bills? Then get a job. You get a job! I'm going out. Yeah, go steal some meat! - Menu hasn't changed much. - Hmm. Oh, we all... all offer some heart-healthy dishes. They have that little carrot by them, so... Yeah, well, I'll have the meatloaf. Okay. And would you like soup, salad, or fries with that? I'll do the fries. Fries. All right. And to drink? - Uh, vani... - Vanilla milkshake? It takes a lot to shock me, okay? I have to text Bobby right now. Oh, my God. I can't believe he's back. - Oh. - Thanks. No pie tonight, Pete? It's apple rhubarb. I've lost my appetite. Oh. How much I owe you? Um, 36.17. Here. Just keep it. Come on. Can I get you ladies anything else? Information? - Hey. - Hi, Frank. Order up! - You coming back? - Yeah. Okay. Here you go. John? John. I don't believe it. Sure has been a long time, hasn't it? Yeah. When'd you get in town? This morning. Sorry about your mom. Thank you. How long you here for? Mm... guess until I sell the property. Pretty piece of land. Wish I had the money, but... Yeah. Me, too. - Hey, Peggy. - Huh? Can I get some of that awful pie of yours to go? It's apple rhubarb. Well, if that's all you have. Uh-huh. Yeah, I do. Just don't gyp me on the slice. Hey, John, what are you doing Sunday? Hadn't really thought that far ahead. Why don't you come for dinner? I know Annie would love to see you. Well, you think about it. I know you got a lot on your plate. Thank you, sweetheart. Good night. See you, son. Coach. Night, Coach. Good night, ladies. Check this out. He looks hungry. Hey, baby. - I'll call you tonight. - Bye. What's going on? I don't know. Okay, everyone, show's over! Go on to your next class. We'll get this cleaned up. I need to get my book. Annie's the one that usually does this. They're her kids now... with everybody all grown up and out. How is Jerry? He's good. He and Lisanne just bought a new house over in Lewiston. I appreciate you having me over, Frank. I don't expect too many invitations, you know, while I'm here. Ah, you probably shouldn't. Yeah. Hey... don't go traveling backwards. We all mistakes. - Yeah. - Let's leave it that way. Okay? Should stop by the firehouse and say hello to the guys. Yeah. Maybe I'll do that. Frank! Honey! Hey, Frank! Um, sorry. I didn't know you had company. I would have called, but I couldn't find my phone. I lost my phone. They turned it off. Okay. What's wrong, Melinda? Is it the kids? Yeah! He's my son! So I'm the one that's gonna be getting him when he's in trouble, okay, not you. You're not family. Okay. Melinda, we tried to reach you. When we couldn't, we didn't know what to do. Joanna was worried that you'd be upset. I said you'd be more upset if I let him sit in jail. I just wish I could control him. He's bad. - He's bad... - He's not. 'cause I'm a bad mom. I'm such a bad mom. No wonder he hates me. Look at me. It's okay. - That's Joanna. - Are you kidding me? Uh-uh! Get back in the car! You get in the car! Melinda, look. She's probably just concerned for you. - I'm sorry. - It's all right. I'm a little toasted. - I'm sorry. - It's okay. John... you remember me? I used to baby-sit you. Of course I do, Melinda. You used to make me root-beer snow-cones. Did I? Can you let Joanna take you home now? - Okay. - Okay. Everything'll seem better tomorrow. I'm sorry. It's okay. It's all right. It's okay. I'm gonna walk you back. Okay. Morning. Morning. I have a, uh, appointment with Bobby Baker. Thanks. John Wright. Bobby. It's been a long time. Yeah. Thanks. Lori said she saw you the other night. I give you this, Wright. You got a lot of guts showing your face around here. Anyhow, what's up? Well, I'm, uh, trying to fix up my mom's house so I can sell it, and I was hoping to get a loan. There's two years worth of back payments due on that property. Yeah. No, I know. Can you pay it? Ah, I mean, some of it. How much? I'd say a couple months. Yeah. Yeah, that's not gonna do it. You're gonna... You're gonna have to bring it current. Well, Bobby, that's why I'm here trying to get a loan. Yeah, we're... we're talking past each other. I can't lend money on a mortgage that's 24 months in default. I only let your mom stay out there because I felt sorry for her. Obviously... she'd been through it. Look... I can't loan you the money, because I'm foreclosing on the property, but here's what I'll do. I'll give you a couple months to get her stuff out of there. Okay, now hold on, Bobby. If I start making payments, legally you can't foreclose. You've been to law school? I can do anything I want. You're not the star here anymore. No one cares about you or your problems. You got two months, and you're out of there. So... if there's nothing else... I got a lot of work to do, buddy. You got everything? Careful on there. John? - Hey. - Hi. - Hi. - Hi... Sorry. I wasn't sure that was you. Yeah, you look different. Yeah. How you doing? Oh, I'm great. Thank you. How are you? I'm good. Hey, Dad, look who it is. It's John. Oh, my goodness. Of course it is. Nice to see you again, John. You, too, Pastor. Hey, Dad, you go on in, and I'll wait out here. Okay. You're back in Garfield? Yeah, back in Garfield. Yeah, not much has changed here. Mm, no. - No. - Mm. I'm sorry about Eva. Thank you, Elizabeth. Yeah. So, uh, what have you been up to? Oh. Well, I'm the school nurse. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. Can you believe that? And, um, I work with Dr. Hendrickson part time. - Okay. - And, uh... You know, you look great. Oh. Thanks. What about you? What's, uh... Where have you been hiding yourself? Or not... You know, not hiding. You don't... I'm on my... my Mom's place, staying there right now. Oh. Well, I hate to break up this reunion, but we really have to get out to the Elkin farm. - Right, we do... - Okay. because they're donating hams to us this year for the Christmas drive, so... All righty. John, I'm sure I'll see you again. Yes, sir. Elizabeth. Yeah, see you around. Good job, Ronnie. Get that hair cut. All right, listen. Need you to be safe, okay? Go, Scotty! - Come on, ref! - Unintentional! Unintentional! Come on! Clean it up, ref! You okay? Let's keep this clean. Yeah! You can do it. Get in there, ref! Pin him, baby! Watch your back! Squeeze down! Squeeze! That's it! Pin! - Yeah! - That's the way to do it. Nice job! Yes. Yes. Attaboy. Attaboy. - That's it. - Attaboy. Way to go, right? Come on. Hey, Frank. Hey, John. Uh-oh. Somebody call security. Hey there, Witt. - Hey, Keith. - Do I know you? Ah, hey, stranger. Better late than never, eh? You guys look the same. - Oh, yeah, I'm sure we do. - Yep. I'm still handsome. Hey, John, I, uh, just made a fresh pot. You want a cup? Yeah, love one. - Sit down. - All right. Hey, you know, uh, we could use an extra hand around here. I'm, uh, starting to worry about these old guys. I bet we still have your mug, too. Facedown, Jamie. Three minutes, people. And Allen loses control of the ball, and that gets the Wildcats going the other way... How's that? ...fresh shot clock. And knocks it in. Thank you. Put it in the center here. Come back tomorrow after school, all right? Yeah. I'll see you then. One of my wrestlers. Appreciate you doing this. No problem. You sure you don't need any help out there? Nah, nah. I'll manage. I'll get it back to you as soon as I can. Hey, John. Good to have you back. Thanks. ♪ We were borne before the wind... ♪ Peggy... would you name a sandwich after Frank at the Busy Bee?

Listen, um, I think we got off to a bad start, and it's my fault. You deserve better than you got from me, and I... just I want to apologize. I bear you no ill will. Oh, yeah? Okay. Hey, good. So I thought that you and I might have a little talk. About what? Well, I been thinking about your situation with this place, and bank issues aside, in its present condition... you're not gonna see any money of it. - Uh-huh. - The land is nothing but scab rock, and... and the house is gonna cost a lot of money to get it right. But... I think I have a fix. A fix, huh? I know that, uh, you had a soft spot for Frank Stevens. I mean, we all loved him. He was a real mentor, and I'm sure it must have been hard for you to face him again. Now that he's gone, I imagine there has to be some regret, right? Whatever my regrets are, Bobby, that's my business. You understand me? I'm only trying to point out... Eh, what are you doing here? What do you want? Okay, I'm gonna be honest with you. I'm very concerned about the wrestling team. - Uh-huh. - I think there's an opportunity for you to do the right thing for this town, and maybe I can help you find a way out of your... your mess. By coaching the team? That's right. Hmm. Your son on the team? - Scott is the team. - Hmm. He's the only one with a shot. Okay, I'm not good at mincing words. I'm prepared to pay you out of my own pocket $150,000 cash for this property. In return, here's what I need from you. Whatever it takes... you make sure he makes it to State. What do you say? We got a deal? We have an understanding? Can we be big boys here and work together on this? What's my guarantee that you're gonna pay me, Bobby? I give you my word. Okay, fine. I'll wire $75,000 into your account now, and the other... rest of the money when you deliver. Nah, I don't have a bank account. Well, we can take care of that. Just come to the bank. Got a deal? Excellent. Get ready to start on Monday. Good luck cleaning this place up, man. Why would you want to mess with that guy? Hey. You ready? Excellent move. Uh, I guess. Are you? Not at all. Then maybe you should be studying. I know, but I'm not. Are you doing well in this class? Why? I don't know. Just trying to make conversation. Why don't you ever come to our Christmas party? I didn't know I was invited. Well... we don't invite people. I mean, everyone's invited. All right, everyone! Settle, please! All right, settle down, people. You should come. Watch out. - Hey. - Hey. You are definitely the big news around here. - Oh, yeah? - Mm-hmm. How 'bout that? You excited? Yeah, sure. Well, I'm this way. - Okay. - So you okay? Yeah. Yeah. We still on for Friday? Yeah. I'll see you then. Okay. Okay let me go. Go. God! Dude, what are you doing? Where are you at, man? Go again. Chill out, man. It's no big deal. - Hey! Stop what you're doing. - What? Let's go. Stand up. Let's line up over here. Come on. Let's go. Um... My name is John Wright, and I'll be filling in until the school finds you guys a new coach. You were in the Olympics, right? Thrown out. What? You were, right? What's your name, man? Scott Baker. Hmm. Yes, I was. Steroids, right? Tomorrow is your last chance for a wrestle-off before the break. So who's challenging? What's your name? Ronnie Leadman. Who you wrestling? Duncan. All right. Michael, what about you? Me. Okay. I'll tell you what. Uh, I'll get the rest of your guys' names later so we don't waste any time. Let's see what you got. Michael, will you put this on the table? - Yeah. - Thanks. Oh, hey. Uh, these... are from Mrs. Phelps. Hmm. Excuse me. What are you supposed to do with these? I thought this was settled. You're not even in school anymore. Wh-Why is she still pushing this? I don't know. I guess she thought I should take a look or something. You really see this happening? Well, she wouldn't be giving 'em to her if she didn't think she had a shot. Well, is she giving 'em to her, or is she loaning 'em? What's the difference? Because I'm sure she wants 'em back. Okay. I'm just saying there's no way she hands out those things and doesn't expect them back, so don't mess 'em up. - They're yours. - Thanks. I don't want her to go. Don't worry, honey. She's not going anywhere. Come here. She's not going anywhere, 'cause she knows we just couldn't manage without her. We just couldn't handle it. No way. Katie, will you wash your hands, please? I'm, uh, wrestling Scott Baker tomorrow for the starting spot. If I beat him, I go to conference. What's this? Chicken enchiladas. I hope I like it. What are the green things? Scallions. Oh. Well... aren't you the little gourmet? Anyway, it's in front of the entire school, and I think a lot of parents are gonna show up. Uh, John Wright coaching, sure they will. This town, people have no lives. Well, if you want to come, it's at 2:00. I can't. I think A.J.'s supposed to do my hair. Yeah, well, that's important. Let's go. Keep wrestling. - Let's go. Keep wrestling. - Go! - Go, Scott! - Come on, Scott! Ho! Out of bounds! Out of bounds! Back to the center. Back to the center. Come on, Coach! - Come on, Scott. - You got this, bro. Two! That's the end of the period. Come on, Mike. Top man, set. You got this, man. Come on, Scott. Get up. - One! - Yeah! There you go. That's it! That's it! Go! Get him! Two! Come on, Mike. Get him up. - Go on! - Whoa. Pin it down. Pin it down. Touch it. Yeah! I was out of pin. I had one shoulder on the mat. - Shake his hand. - Are you kidding me? Shake his hand. Yeah, man. You lost.

Ah, that's her. Why don't we do this some other time? - What do you think? - Yeah, we'll talk, yeah. - Okay. - Yeah. Goodbye, John. Merry Christmas. Help me. State has been in the lead 14-7... Um, let me just clear this up. Oh, you don't have to do that. Don't worry. Leave it. He won't be staying long. Okay. What do you want? I just wanted to stop by and see how you're doing, let you know if you need anything, I'm around. Good to know. I was hoping you could come by, uh, practice next week, even if you're not ready to wrestle. I was ready to wrestle. Uh-huh. Okay, um... hope you feel better. - Let's go. - All right, work him, Ronnie! - Work him! - This is a fight! - Put him down! - Let's go, Ronnie! Look for the leg! Look for the leg! Look for the leg! That's it! - That's it. - Keep your shoulders up! - There we go. - Nice control, Ronnie! - Flip him! - Bury him! - All right. - Tear him up! - Tear him up! - You got it! - Hey. Hey! Hey! - Attack! Hey! Shut up! You shut up. We're having fun. Practice is over. Practice is over! Shouldn't be an issue on our end. I-I have no problem with that. Hey, John, come in. Get off the phone. Get off the phone. Um, I gotta go. Uh, what's up? Your kid's off the team. That's what's up. Excuse me? - Your kid's off the team. - Uh, slow it down. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. - The deal is off. - That's it. - Slow down. It's over. It's done. Hey, we have a deal. Don't you threaten me. I saw Scott attack Michael. What? I saw him do it. You saw him do it? You know, Bobby, you should be proud. You raised a real animal. If it's true, you would have stopped it. Yeah? Well, guess what. I'm stopping it right now. Hey, you know what? You're making a huge mistake. Well, it wouldn't be the first time. I'm gonna ruin you. You know what, Bobby? I look around, and it seems that you got a lot more to lose than I do. You want the whole town to know that you tried to buy your son the number one spot? Hmm? Scott is number one. Just like you are, right? Hello. Can I help you? Yeah. Is Elizabeth in? Do you have an appointment? No. No, I don't. Are you a new patient? What do you mean? Here. Why don't we get you started by... I'm just looking for Elizabeth. - Hey. - Hey. How are you? Uh... - You, uh... - I'm fine. - Yeah, I'm just fine. - Yeah. Okay. What's going on? You need something? Um, nah. I just wanted to stop by and say hi. Ok... Hey, Tori, uh, room three's out of changing gowns. Can you take care of that, please? - Yeah, okay. - Thank you. I just wanted you to... to know that, um... you know, I'm feeling better. Good. Yeah. Well... actually I just wanted you to know. Okay. Well, I'm glad to hear that. - Okay. - Okay. I'll let you get back to work. I just... I don't know. I'll see you later. Is it true about Scott? I don't know. What do you mean? - Nice to meet you. - That he left the school? I have no idea. Hey, guys, let's focus. Come on now. What is it, Deck? I'd like to say something. Michael... I want to apologize to you, man... for my part in what happened that night. It was wrong. I feel really bad about it. Now, I don't expect you to forgive me. I wouldn't. But I'm sorry. If you ever need anything, man, just let me know. All right. Ronnie. Um... yeah, Mike, I'm sorry, too. We all, uh... It just went too far, you know? And like Deck said, wasn't right. Dude, I'm really sorry. Okay. Uh, we need to pick a new captain, so, Deck, given that you're a senior, you got the second-best record, you're next in line, all right? Eh, if it's all the same to you, Coach, I'd like to nominate Miller. You guys okay with that? Yes, sir. Michael, what do you think? Well, I mean, it was unanimous. Thanks, guys. Let's start warming up. All right. What's wrong? Where's Katie? She's at the church. Mom dropped her off this morning. She's not coming back. What are you doing? It's late. She can't be up right now. I'm watching a movie. Well, not this movie, okay? This is ridiculous. Okay, okay, okay. I'm sorry. You missed practice today. You all right? - Uh, yeah. Hold on. - I want Mommy now! Hey, I'll be outside! It's easier to talk out here. It's just a little crazy in there right now. Yeah, well, it's gotta be a lot to deal with. I can't imagine. Yeah, it's pretty messed-up. Anyway, uh, I have to quit school if the family's gonna stay together. I may have to get a full-time job and... well, that's life, I guess. I mean, I wish I didn't, but... I'm not giving up my family. No, of course not. Family first. Gotta take care of that, Michael. What about your Dad? Where's he at? Well, Katie's Dad's dead. He was killed in prison. Ours hasn't been around for a long time, and personally, we really don't need to see him again. But look, Joanna and I can handle this. I mean, she's used to taking care of Katie, anyway. Okay. What about the school? They know you're quitting? Not yet. All right, well, listen, do me a favor. Just hold off on that for a little while, all right? Yeah. All right. Well, I'll let you go. Take care. Hey, Coach. Thanks for stopping by. Of course. Sorry to keep you waiting. Want to go to my office? Nah, here's fine. Did you guys redo the windows? We haven't. Why? They look new? I don't know. Maybe, I guess. Ah, they're very old. But you didn't come here to discuss windows. What's on your mind? I, um... I'm concerned about, uh, Michael Miller. And, um, well, I don't know how to help him. What that boy needs right now is a friend. He could use a good man to look up to, someone he can respect, trust. That's not me. Why not? I was there. I-I was there the night that Michael got jumped. I saw it all go down, and I... I didn't help him. I know who did it. But, Pastor, I'm not the man to look up to. I'm not sure I agree. I can't tell him. You don't need to tell him, and you shouldn't. You just told me. And more importantly, you told Him. Understood? You see how easy that was? I don't know why people make it so complicated. John... suffering the consequences of your actions doesn't mean that you or your life is condemned. God forgives, period. Just ask Him. I have. I do every day. Well, then, my friend, it's a done deal. Okay. I've got some phone calls to make. Right. Why don't you come back tomorrow morning around 9:00, and we'll see if we can get this figured out. Okay. You leaving or staying? I'll stay a while. Welcome, everyone. If you could all take your seats, that'd be great. Thank you very much for coming. Okay. John. Down here, John. Good morning, everybody. Good morning. Thanks to those who were able to change their schedules at the last minute. John and I had a conversation last night, and, uh, well, why don't I let him fill you in? John? I'm, um, sure you all know about the Miller kids and the bad situation that they're in. Uh, Michael is considering quitting school so that he can take care of his family. Seems like a lot to ask of a kid, so I don't know what can be done, but I hope something. I know a while back, I, uh... I let down a lot of you folks. And I could stand up here, and I could, uh... make excuses for why I cheated, but I won't. It was stupid. You know, after everything was over and, uh, the media and... I just couldn't bring myself to come back here. You know, I thought... maybe one day, when I was ready, I-I would, but, uh, as time went on, it just got harder and harder. Eventually I just kinda... I gave up on the idea. I want you guys to all know that I didn't mean to hurt you. You know, my parents deserved much more, especially my mom. But I appreciate everything you did to help her... but it should have been me. Anyway, I want you to know th-that I'm very sorry that I let you down... but I hope you can forgive me. Thank you. Thank you, John. So we thought if we, uh, put our hands and... and our hearts together, we could come up with some ideas. Peggy. If those kids need help, I can offer them work. Carol. That young woman belongs in college. She was a stellar student, and she's too young to be playing Mom at her age. Absolutely. Yes, Annie. Hi. Thank you. I'd like to speak to what John just shared. John... Frank and I have always had you in our hearts, honey, and we forgave you a long time ago, but now it's time for you to forgive yourself and move on with the rest of your life, and I hope that it's here. He also had a special spot for Michael, and, uh... Oh, gosh. I'm... I'm not sure what I'm saying, because it's really early, and I haven't even had my first cup of coffee... but, uh, okay. Here goes. It's... It's just me now, the horses, the dog in that house. I could use the company. I've got the room. Why don't I take them in? Wow. That's a generous offer, Annie. Are you sure you don't want that cup of coffee first? It's the right thing to do, and besides, I know a good horse when I see one, and, John, you have got a thoroughbred in Michael Miller. Teach that boy like Frank taught you. Come here, Mike. I love you, Mike. Let's go! Move! Down. 15. 3, 4, 5... 6, 7... First here. Come around. You all right? Deck, pay attention. You're next. Right here... Let's go! Let's go, Scott! Get... Good. Get him back. Get him back. Get him back. Single leg. There you go. Push it. One more, man. Bring it down. Move! Yeah, there you go. All right, go! Come on. - Go! Explode! - Come on! Let's go! Go! Yeah. - Come on! - That's right! Whoo! Whoo! All right, awesome. Come sit down with me. Good job. I wanna talk to you all. Well, we got conference. Three days. I know that you're probably a little nervous about the tournaments that are coming up. That's natural. I was nervous. Use it. You understand? I want you guys to know that I'm proud of you and the hard work that you've put in. Everybody on this team has sacrificed one way or another. I've seen you guys give your best. I've seen it. I've seen you guys come together as a team and build strong core fundamentals. That's the hard work, boys. That's what puts the other guy on his back. You go out there with the same guts and the same determination that you show in practice, and that's good enough for me. It's good enough. Okay, enough of this. Go home. Get some rest. I'll see you tomorrow. All right, guys, bring it in. Panthers on three. 1, 2, 3... Panthers! All right, guys Hey, Coach. We want to ask you something. Oh, yeah? Yeah. We're, uh... Well, we were just wondering, just how good do you have to be to make the Olympic team? Mm, that was a long time ago, boys. Eh, you look like you're in pretty good shape. Mm. You done blowing smoke up my ass, Deck? - Huh? - Well, the thing is, John, we all voted, and we want to see what you got. Yeah, Coach. I don't think that's such a good idea, Deck. - Aw, come on! - So... - So I've been picked... - Come on! - So I've been picked... - You've been picked? to challenge you one-on-one right now. Yeah, and since you're an old-timer, you know, we... we can make it easy on you. We could go for a minute or, you know, 'til first takedown or whatever comes first. - Come on. We want it. - You guys want it? - Yeah! - You guys want it? - Let's do it. - Gotta do it. - You want it, Deck? - Oh, yeah. I want it. - Go on, son. - Whoo! Let's go, Coach. Don't stall on me now, Coach. That's not my style, Deck. This is. You okay? All right. See you guys in a bit. - Hey. - Hi. Um, delivery. What is this? It's from Annie. It's Frank's jacket. Yeah. - And his tie. - I know. - That's beautiful. - It really is, right? Yeah, let her know I said thank you. I will. I thought that maybe I could give you a hand. - Oh, yeah. I mean... - Do you need a hand? You think? Yeah. Yeah. No, uh... I mean, it's a bit of a disaster, but, uh... - Yeah. - you know... start throwing whatever in boxes. Okay, so there's no system. - No, it's all going. - Okay. - Just put it in a box. - All right. This is really generous that you're doing this. Yeah, it's what my mom would have wanted. - Oh. - She was a collector, - as you can see. - Uh-huh. Now it's your dad's problem. I heard that you're staying at the firehouse 'til the season's over. Is that true? Yeah. - Cool. - This is a good book. Actually, I might keep that. Yeah. It, uh... It's a good thing for me, and it works out for them, and, you know... I need newspaper. You have newspaper? - Uh... - Can I have that? - Yeah. - Wait. Are these all going? Yeah. These are all going? - Mm-hmm. - This, too? Yeah. Why? You want 'em? No, I want you to want them. John... Look, I... Like, whatever happened after this, I don't even know, and, like, it really doesn't matter, but these? I mean, come on. You worked so hard for these. Right? Like... you earned these. - Mm-hmm. - Didn't you? - Yes, Elizabeth. - Okay. So please don't throw them away. What's that one say? "Tri-state Champion." Totally remember that. Gosh. They used to mean so much to me. I don't even know who this person is anymore. Here. Pack it. I know him. All right, you know what? New plan. - This is my box. - Yeah, yeah. I'm taking them, okay? I'll hold on to them, and then when you, like, get to wherever it is you're going, I'll, uh... I'll send 'em out to you, okay? And then if you still don't want 'em, you can throw 'em away. Then I don't have to watch. Good plan? Yeah, but... kind of sounds like you're trying to get rid of me actually in a way. Does it? Just a little bit, yeah. Okay, well, you're wrong. I'm not... - Oh, yeah? - trying to get rid of you. No, I'm not. Are you cra... Good. Let's go! Hustle up! Lay it down. And good evening, wrestling fans.

Ref! - What? - You're not gonna call that? - Call what? - He just elbowed him. - I didn't see that, Coach. Right back here. Center. John Wright does not like that one bit. Need to block your head. - Keep him off your head. - One hand, Miller snaps, and flies through off the mat. - Back to center. - Keep pushing the pace. Run him all over the mat. Let's go! Come on! You go out of bounds, no points. Set. Low-scoring affair here at 3-3. - Trying to work that head. - Squeeze! Squeeze! That'll end the first period, 3-3 here at 152. Green's choice. Green's down. Red's top. Right here. Coach, you see this a lot. Former teammates that know each other left and right, hard to score in this situation sometimes. Right.

Let's go! He's frustrated. He's frustrated. Good hustle! Coach Gable, you had John Wright as an athlete at Iowa. He was known for winning matches late. He would be down early, would always be in a match. What do you think he's taught his young wrestler here? Well, he's had a strong will himself. He's given that to his athletes. Go. Come on. Let's go. One, red, escape, neutral! - Get back... - Miller turns and faces up and out with the escape. 10 to 6. Down four points, third period. Randy Lewis, what's Mr. Miller gotta do to win this thing? He needs to score three takedowns to send it into overtime or get a takedown on back points, so he's really gotta go now. Ref!
