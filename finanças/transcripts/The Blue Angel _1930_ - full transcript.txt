A few bottles of champagne. You held it just fine. One? Two? Three. You really are a sweetie. Good? Delicious. Extraordinary! You see? You could have this every day. There's no reason why not. After all, l'm not married. l must get to school. l must hurry and get to school. Come here. Stand still. Do you still love me? What's this, no good-bye? Give me a kiss. Do you love me too? Yes, of course. Good-bye. Mind the traffic. Morning, Professor. Morning. Sit down! Professor, it stinks here of garbage! Garbage! Silence! l'll have you all locked up! Miserable brats!

You are speaking of my future wife. You can't be serious. l am completely serious. l will not hear another word. l'm very sorry, my dear fellow, but l'll have to report the matter. Get your stuff packed. The train won't wait for you! Come in. Hello, Professor. Make yourself useful! - Why'd l marry you? - l wonder about that too. Put the flowers in here. And don't crush them.

My dear Miss Lola, l brought you something else as well. Would you accept this gift from me? And at the same time may l ask for your hand? You want to marry me? My God you're sweet! l hope, my child, you are fully aware of the gravity of this moment. Long may they live! Every happiness for the newlyweds! Ladies and gentlemen, - it gives me great pleasure to... - Enough of your blather! Here we go again. My wedding ceremony was like this, so lovely. lf l had known you then, perhaps l'd be the wife of a professor now, instead of this conjurer. That's right, l am a conjurer! We're in for more of his stupid stunts. Sit down. Would you deny the professor a display of my art? With your permission, l'll pull a few eggs from under your nose. As you can see, my hand is empty. Here, take it, please. There's something to be proud of. Watch this, Professor. Honey, hand me my small case. You are the clumsy one. Why bring the cards? What a dumb question. We sell them at shows. As long as l've a penny to my name, they will not be sold! Well, you never can tell. We'd better keep them. Beware of blonde women, they're special, every one. At first you may be unaware, but something is definitely there. A little hanky-panky can be fun, but from their clutches you'd better run. Beware of blonde women, they're special, every one.

A living. lf you don't like it, go. l will go. l'll go. l'll go. l can't stand it! l'd rather die like a dog than lead this life another day. Well then, hand me my stockings. Get the curling iron. lt's much too hot! Well, Teach, how are we today? Care for a cigar? Havana with a Sumatra wrapper. Our manager appears to be in high spirits. l am, and for a very good reason. You should be pleased too. You're going to be my top attraction. Don't rib the old guy, he hasn't hurt you. You stay out of this. Your husband's a big star. Here... A contract, confirmed by cable. And where? ln the Blue Angel. The Blue Angel? Yes, we're returning to your hometown. We'll hang posters... Never! l'll never go back. - You'll change your mind. - l will not change my mind. lsn't that just like you? You've lived off this woman for five years. And now when you finally can earn a few cents, the Professor says, l won't go! - Leave him alone. He'll go. - l won't! We're leaving, that's final. No, l won't go. Never! You can ask anything of me, but not that! - Don't get all worked up. - No, l won't do it. Never. No one'll force you. lN PERSON - Hello, sir! - Good morning, you finally made it!

Good day! - Why should l, business is good. - Glad to hear it. - And you? - Better now, but the last few weeks... - Be seeing you, Boss. - See you, Maestro. But not for at least ten years, l hope.

There's no double bottom, no secret opening or trap door. This top hat, ladies and gentlemen, l shall now place on the head of our August, and will make so bold as to produce a live dove before your very eyes! Ladies and gentlemen, l know you're all thinking l've already placed the dove in the hat. But no, you are quite mistaken. Empty. Absolutely empty. lf l may, here's more proof. A dagger. Here we go... One, two, three, four. Please, do not be alarmed by the sight of the revolver in my right hand. There! August isn't bird-brained! This is an outrage! Call the police! Mr. Magician, l've run out of eggs. Could you conjure a few up for me? Of course, sir, with pleasure. Ladies and gents, l shall produce some eggs from August's nose... before your very eyes. Pull yourself together, August! l mean, you were a professor! l know you're convinced August has the eggs under his top hat. But you're wrong. Another dove! The eggs! Where are the eggs? Right away, ladies and gents, at your service. One, two, three... An egg! Where's your "cock-a-doodle-doo"? A genuine hen's egg. See... Lay more eggs! lf you don't crow, l'll kill you! Here we go.

You asked for it. l don't get it, an educated man like you... All for some dame. Get some rest. Leave it to me. l'll take care of things. Falling in love again, never wanted to. What's a girl to do? l can't help it. What choice do l have? That's the way l'm made. Love is all l know, l can't help it. Men swarm around me like moths round a flame. And if their wings are singed, surely I can't be blamed. Falling in love again, never wanted to. What's a girl to do? l can't help it. Subtitles: Robert Gray, Kinograph and VlCOMEDlA 10/2001
