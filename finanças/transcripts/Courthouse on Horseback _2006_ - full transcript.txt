But wait for a moment... No! Deal with it now! The pig dug up my ancestors! Ah-Luo, you take care of this leave the court now! We must follow the court procedure We'll deal with it later. Take the pig a way I won't leave if you don't hear my case Get the pig out of here Get the pig out of here Take it a way! I would never leave if you don't hear the case I see.

Ok, I will If not, I'll kill your pig The People's Court is now in session Sit down What do you want, a ruling at the court or settling it between yourselves you 've been quarreling for half a year for the family property. Now you're coming to the court merely for a pickle jar Do you think it is proper? After all, you're sisters-in-law my Pot was dug out What should I do? The bones of my ancestors were all in it They're all gone It's bad luck for my family What can I do about it? How did it come to that? So it's your ancestors' ashes inside? Both of you live in the same village you meet each other everyday you have a quarrel today Can you a void seeing each other forever? It's unreasonable to fight over such a tiny thing If you keep quarreling every day It may fester into something worse Yang, how's it going? So you two should forget and forgive! you both should get along well with each other Show some consideration Be generous to each other Now shake hands, ok? Yes, don't be so stubborn you should be considerate And set a good example for your kids... Well, you're the elder one So you show some generosity Then how about you? What's the problem? What's this all about? Come on you are the younger one you give up the jar Shake hands with her Or the elder one elder sister-in-law What's the problem with you two? Be an elder sister! Be good sisters-in-law! you just won't listen Seems that I've been wasting my time Here is 5 Yuan for the jar Half each! give it to them Take it Take it Take the money and buy two jars Well done! Well done!! So, you two just shake hands and make up you should get along well later It was so smart of you I never know how to deal with women Now the case is closed They will never talk to each other I'm also a woman! What are you looking at? Fine Had lunch? Yeah Feng Yeah I've settled the pig case Yeah How did you handle it? It makes no sense It's not our business It doesn't even make a case What do you mean? Do you know What a "Pot" is? Of course I know But the pig doesn't Pigs just run on the hill They are not human How can they know what the "Pot" means It's just a Pot Not a big loss! But the complainant claims a pig and a Buddhist service as compensation It's so ridiculous So how did you deal with it? I.. I told him that the laws do not support the superstitious activitie and rejected their requests. So, you didn't deal with it at all? It is not even a case Do you know how many descendents are involved in it? If you are unable to handle it properly, it may lead to a mass fight There's a law against fighting Bullshit! What bullshit! you know what someone has got killed while fighting over a chicken! It's a big matter that the pig dug up the tomb It may lead to big trouble If you don't do anything to it now, someone might get killed The court will have to deal with it then! And even worse thing might happen the police might come, and someone would be arrested! Look Now it comes Zhang Long, come out! your pig had dug up my Pot Mound We didn't do it! It was the pig! We are not responsible for it! Stop! Sop! Why didn't you accept my case? Nobody said that Am I dealing with it right now? Zhang Long Get inside Come along with me! I'll see how you deal with it The court must deal with it! Come along with me! What's the death of the pig related to your ancestors? I got a dream last night my ancestors will punish us So ancestors appeared in your dream But dreams can't be taken so seriously I had a dream last night too I married a pretty woman in the dream. Where is she now? How about they give you a pig and hold a Buddhist service as compensation? No, two pigs No way. at least two pigs! Why two pigs? you Do you have pigs at home? Yeah Drive a pig out and dig up the Pot Mound of Zhong Long's family! What are you doing, Judge? What? Let's go Will show you what I'm going to do! I haven't finished my words yet Who asked you to drive the pig out? you did you asked me to take a pig and dig up his Pot Mound I'll fight till death if any one dares to do it! Zhang Long So you said you would fight till death for it! Yes, I said so! Good Now, try to put yourself in his shoes Just like his pig cannot dig up your Pot Mound your pig cannot dig up his. Understand what I mean? Do you get it? Now it's settled One pig and a Buddhist service as compensation. Please wait The court cannot support The second request! Right, Right The court can't support it No If there's no Buddhist service Our ancestors won't agree with it! No more argument! Judges are human They got to eat also Let's go for lunch now! Let's go Are you stupid? Do you need the court's support to find a Lama? Well What have you learnt from university? you can't always leave a mess for others to clear up What a good solution, you even asked the guy to dig up the Pot Mound It's better having college education If you allow them to hold the service it will be a mistake you thought I'd never been to college? Yang I heard our salaries would be raised It's only your business, but nothing to do with me That's good news I can get more dowry for my daughter I should have cared for her more But they don't care about you I don't blame them It's not easy for them to do business at Lijiang If I were you, I would spend all the money I'll leave nothing to them Zhang Long refused to give me the pig Look I knew it would go wrong Why did you change your mind? my ancestors said we could give the pig, but they could not take it Why's that? Just can't Shut up you just can't take the pig you shut up too Shut up Who can? Grandpa can take it a way Where's Grandpa? He got angry and went home So, Grandpa has left? Yeah you would obey the court's decision As the judge, is that ok I take the pig a way? We won the case! Take it! Ouch my back! you deserve it! What? you are a judge, on behalf of the government Do you think it's proper for you running with a pig around the village? Was it funny? What's wrong with that? If you don't deserve respect the badge on your uniform should do. I felt ashamed for you Shut up your mouth! In 1975, I had my first duty trip here I started with the Village of Chicken Head Then the Chicken Neck, and Chicken Belly And my trip ended at Chicken Tail It felt like, you know a load of chicken shit dumping out Sorry Go ahead Keep on eating Need a hand?

Never told them What? How can you have the wedding without them? It's OK I can tell them later When my parents got married They didn't tell me either you were not made yet! How could they tell you? Cut it out Ah-Luo Are you clear with that case? Almost But a bit confused about the case at Chicken Tail Why does the one asking for divorce have to give everything to the other? It's not fair It's the custom. you should've known that! I find the custom quite good Not like people in the city Divorce is as easy as throwing a way old shoes Take this It's cold at night What about you? Should I sleep somewhere else? Bullshit Did I talk in sleep last night? you did What did I say? Can't remember Leaving now? Yeah, see you Take care Is he dozing off Who said that?

Feng I heard that Auntie Yang does have a partner Who? you do care, don't you? you little buster! Yang's been very decent We're just colleagues Don't even go there She's had a hard life It was many years ago In the late 1970s The government recruited some officials among the ethnic minority people And she was selected to work in the court Moso people have the custom of visiting marriage But it can't be practiced in the city As a result She never got married Now it's the 21st century a new policy came into force, All government officials must have college diplomas She doesn't have any diploma She has to make room for a college graduate like you She's only 46 years old. The new policy was not made by me And I am sorry about it... Sleep well! Feng Feng A burglar That's the signal It's the partner visiting his woman Feng! The horse was stolen Really?

Get them the wine We are not here for the wine We are here to find the reason Why you killed our goats? your goats got caught while eating our crops So they are our goats We'll kill the goats as many as we catch How could you kill our goats like that? It's not reasonable! Not reasonable? Judge Feng is here. He's most reasonable. Let him judge who's right Is that OK? Who is calling me? Our goats got into their farmland and were killed by them. Is that right, Judge Feng? So you mean that they killed your goats? Do you have any evidence?

Welcome back Good to see you! you found the horse. When was it found? The day that you left Who stole it? Ah-Luo and his bride are here Ah-Luo! Judge Feng Hi, Auntie See you later Auntie Yang How's the case? Have you no shame? you ran a way with the girl you know what negative impact it has They said they would not go to court They would never go to court What does it mean? It means they refuse the jurisdiction of the court and the national emblem! It has nothing to do with me We're lawfully married I didn't do anything wrong! you are from the Yi group. you should know the custom your father-in-law was angry Couldn't you wait for a while till he got calming down? He would soon calm down. you 've got the marriage certification you 're a legal couple anyway you'll have your woman sooner or later Can't you just leave your woman for a while? A woman is more important than the image of a judge? What is the image of a judge? Wearing the uniform and the badge run with a pig across the village? Do you call that the image of a judge? Buying a piglet with 150 Yuan Is that the image of a Judge in your mind? I was glad to do so! Of course you were! you're just trying to improve your own image! If your image is good Why did your wife and daughter leave you? Ah-Luo! Who told you that? Every one at the courthouse knows that Aren't you sorry about it? Bullshit! you do not deserve to be a judge! you 've no right to give comment on it, Judge Feng Get out! Go to hell! Mother Where is the guy? Which guy? The guy who stole the horse Why are you asking? Hand him over to the police They've already punished him We can't do that again Then I'll have to call the police She said we couldn't do that and it's unkind She said they'd never tell us who stole the horse that we would never catch the thief What're you looking at? you look different now Remember to wash your clothes often I will Not only wash clothes, but also yourself I will. you're retiring in a couple of years When you go to see your wife and daughter at Lijiang How can they take to you if you're so messy?
