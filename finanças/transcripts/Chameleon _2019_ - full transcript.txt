You really believe we can just switch out our lives? The decisions we've already made this late in the game? I mean, you really think we can change? What makes you believe you'll be able to acclimate back into society competently without reoffending? I'm sitting here before you both today a fully rehabilitated person without a doubt. I've taken ownership for my wrongdoings in the past, and my good behavior in here and my letter of support acknowledges that. What specific plans do you have upon release if we grant your parole? I plan to start a new life for myself in a more rural area, and then I just look forward to giving back to the community. Is there anything else you'd like to add? I would really appreciate it if you could find it in your hearts to grant me this opportunity to start an honest life for myself. That's all I want. We'll take everything under consideration. Thank you so much for your time. Just drop me a line, huh, playboy? We'll get up when I get out. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, come on. Faster! It keeps pilling up. Let's go! - Really the only job you can find? - Yeah. I... I've been in prison before, so that makes it hard to get a job. This is just a onetime thing. Cool? Yeah. Yeah, that's cool. Good night. Look, I'm just... I'm looking after you, okay? No, you're not looking after me. - You're young. - You're micromanaging me... Look, just calm down, all right? I just want you to go on and do your job, all right? - I'm doing my job! - All right, just calm... all right! Hello? Yeah, can I speak to motherfucking Patrick, please? Who is this? Man, don't break my heart. I just got out, man. Haha, Dolph. Yeah, I'm finally up out of there. I heard you was in L.A. - Hello? - That's cool, man. Um, let me know when you get out here, and I'll show you around. Hell yeah, you will. Shit, everything good over there? Shh, it could be worse. That plan you talked about. Let's do it. It's time to make some money, man. You haven't changed a bit. Hey, baby, people don't change, man. Shit. You know, smoking's actually illegal in certain areas in L.A. - For real? - Yeah. Hey, they're gonna have more than smoke to worry about after we're finish with they asses, right? Hey, but this place is nice as shit, though. Yeah, it's nice. I like it. I wonder where they get all this goddamn money from. Just people using people out here, man. - That's all it is. - Mm. Well, we're gonna fit right on in. Oh, yeah. What you been up to, bro? Just, you know, trying keep to the straight and narrow. So you'd rather be broke and stay broke instead of making some quick fucking cash? Now, that's the real prison. I know the real you. A damn criminal, just like me. Come on, man, you ain't seen your boy in a minute. Just indulge me. I don't know, maybe get close to one of these trophy wives until you have access to her rich husband's money. See, that's what I'm talking about, man. You're a single con artist, man. No hesitation. There's a lot of them out here, man. Don't know how good they got it. Check it out. Get them to committing, they have something to lose right there. Throw them in the back of a van. Husband forks over the dough. We good. Easy money. Man, we'll be set for the long haul, man. I'm not going back to that life because... hey! It's life if we get caught. Man, fuck prison. - I'm with you on that. - Yeah. But don't forget you had me protecting you in there, man. And like you said, you owe me. Your words. You're talking about kidnapping. Do you know what that means? Ain't nothing gonna happen to nobody. Believe me. Didn't I make sure ain't nothing happened to you in prison? Huh? Yes or no? Yeah. Bet. Now, partner, when I get back, we're gonna have to get the fuck up out of here 'cause we ain't paying for this. Man, look. We're gonna need some upfront money too. It felt so real at the time. He had really convinced me that we were in love. I had no idea that people were capable of such terrible things. You. Where were you, on break? Here, here. You see that? Other end of the room. It's Jimmy Sales and his wife Jenna. How'd you pick these two? Seemed like pretty shitty people who could do with some humbling. Hmm. What about the asshole? What does he do? "What the hell? Is that it?" He's, like, a music producer or something. Definitely an asshole. What about the broad? Actress. She's good. Got a couple of credits, but nothing big. Hmm. Sound easily enough. What next? When he goes to the bathroom, I'm gonna go over there. Say that I recognize her from something. Introduce myself as a young successful agent who'd like to, you know, get her some meetings. Give her a call by the end of the week and take her for a drink, and yeah, the rest should be pretty easy. Theoretically. Hmm. That's some cold-blooded shit. Then it's my turn. What's your idea? I was thinking, um... maybe we could get out of town for the weekend? I mean, yeah. I'm sure I can come up with some kind of story. Make something happen. This is nice. You like it? Hey, baby. Did you miss me? Come... What the fuck? What the fuck? Shh! Shh shh shh. Shh shh shh. Fuck off! Hello? Rebecca? This isn't your wife. Well, who the hell is this? Look, man, you don't know who I am, but I've been having an affair with your wife. Something's happened to her, and there was a note on the table. How long does that last? The amount I gave her? She's gonna be out a couple more hours. Is she gonna be all right? Yeah, man. You all right? Getting second thoughts or some shit? Are there any side effects? Vomiting or whatever. She'll be all new by the time she head back to Brentwood for pilates. It's the ransom note. You talk to the husband? Yeah, man, he's on his way. Sounded scared shitless. He's got the money, though. Well, there it is. Time to get paid, lover boy. What the hell is that for? Just in case. You're not starting to actually feel for these bitches, are you? Just don't do anything stupid. Let's get the money and get back to L.A. Hey, man. Did you bring the money? Yeah, I got the money. Who the hell would do something like this to me? Where's the note? The ransom note, where is it? - James? - Yeah. Yeah, I... you want to come inside, and I'll show you where I found the note? You got the money? Yeah, in hundreds like you said. Where the fuck is she? - What the fuck has been going on? - I... I don't know. I don't know. I just... If we just follow the instructions. Hey. I could only come up with most of it. Okay? No, no, you hang on to that for now. Do you want to come inside? I'll show you where I found the note. This is our daughter's college education. - Where'd you find this? - Right there. And how long have you known my wife? Um, just about two months. Look, um, I've only got about $4,500 in my bank account. Yeah, I'll take care of it. Which car are we taking? We're not going to take the Porsche. Take the Beamer. You remember where they said to go? Yeah. Yeah. Goddamn! Your husband must really love you to get you that big fucking rock. What the... What the... Please, open the door! Are you there? Are you there? Please! He was very handsome, very sweet, very charming. I thought we were in love. What a piece of shit. I just feel sorry for the next poor girl. Yeah. Drinks on you? Congratulations, motherfucker. Hey, we're on our way to having a couple of trophy wives ourselves. - Question. - You may proceed. When the girls are in the van... Yeah? ...I don't know, do you... do anything to do them beyond what we talk about? What you mean? Like, do I rape them? Well, yeah. The third one, I did. Hey, man, I'm just fucking with you, dawg. Come on, man. It's not funny, man. Man, look... you find that next one yet? I'm not doing it anymore, man. The fuck you mean? I'm done. It's wrong, man. We've been pushing our luck far enough. We should... we should just quit while we're ahead. And then do what? What you wanna do? You want to do a different kind of job? I don't know, I just don't want to terrorize these people anymore. Look, you said it yourself, man. These motherfuckers deserve it. I don't know. You said that. All right, look, one more. We do one more, and then you can go back to whatever it is the fuck you was doing before this shit. Man, we can be set for years, man. Come on, now. Don't you ever, you know, think that all this might come back around? Consequences are for motherfuckers that get caught. We not getting caught. But I... does your conscious ever bother you? Morality is some man-made bullshit. Shit's for suckers, man. What the hell do you believe in, then? Survival of the fittest. They're having a good goddamn time. Fuck, man, you killing me with this shit. Man, get that money and go invest in some stocks or something, man. And look at it this way. Man, you won't even have to owe me no more. We'll be done. Now, come on, now. I gotta sit here and beg a motherfucker to make some money? There you go. Man the fuck up. There's a bathroom back there if you wanna go fix your dress or something. What can I do for you? Four rosés, soda, and a lime, please. Four rosés. Soda. Lime. Got you. Be right back. Can I have one of those as well? And a Grey Goose as well, please? Four rosés. Soda. Grey Goose. All right, be right back. Can I help you with something? Sorry, I didn't mean to stare. My sweet? Please. Excuse me, uh, who are they? That's Frank Emerson. Who's Frank Emerson? Frank Emerson, the big tech guy. They come here all the time. Know her name? Uh, Rebecca? Becky? Bridget? I don't know, one of those White girl names. Cool. Thanks, man. Oh, yeah, no problem. Last burner. Number's on the back. Cool. I think Rebecca's the one. The one? The last one. Fuck Rebecca, man. This Frank Emerson, you say he's a big tech guy or whatever? Ain't this the type of shit we've been waiting on? It's about time we double down on this ransom. Yeah, just let me worry about Mrs. Emerson first. Do your thing, playboy. Do your thing. Oh, you know what, he didn't bring me valet, either. I'm gonna hit that and get that. Okay. Excuse me? You've been staring. Again. - You don't like it? - No, I don't. It's actually making me really uncomfortable. - May I? - No. What are you doing? Are you crazy? I'll go crazy if I don't see you again. You already are crazy. My husband's coming back any second. - Come on, seriously... - Look, look, look. If you just give me your number, I'll leave. I don't even know you. Joseph. Joe. Well, you have a lot of nerve, Joseph. I'm married. I know, and you're also very beautiful. Boy. I bet you say that a lot. You're not half as charming as you think you are, Joseph. I'm gonna give you my number, and if you change your mind, you can call me. If not, that's fine. Okay, fine, just hand it over. Give it to me and leave. You gonna call me? - I'm not gonna call you. - That's fine. Just take... just take it. It's lovely meeting you. - Bye. - Have a good night. All right, I'm good. Yeah. Patrick, it sounds like you're in there. Maybe. Definitely a tough one. Now, that's for sure. You sound like a fucking schoolgirl. What, you like her or something? What? No. Well, it sounds like you like her. Oh, unknown number, man. This could be her. - Shh shh shh. - Hey, don't fuck it up, man. We asking for more money this time. Not many men would have the balls to come up to me in public. Let alone demand my phone number while my husband is in the bathroom. It... it was effective. What does your husband do? Frank? - Why? - I'm just curious. Frank is... well, he makes a lot of money. He's smart and extremely private. - Mm-hmm. - And he has gone to considerable lengths to keep it that way. So very wealthy man who doesn't like attention. That's very un-L.A. of him. Yeah, that's not the only thing he doesn't want these days. Let's not talk about your husband anymore. What? Well... I was thinking, um... would you want to maybe get out of town or something for a few days? And go where? Have you ever been to Big Bear? And what would we do there? We could do whatever you want. Okay. Let's go to Big Bear. I think your ass in love or something. What are you talking about, man? I'm gonna rob her. I want to. Then what the fuck taking so long? I'm almost there. Shit, I can't tell. With the last couple ones, they've been getting pretty rough. Yeah, I know. And what about it? I'm not running a fucking day care. This ain't no hospice. We're fucking kidnapping them. No, I'm just saying... that Rebecca's finally agreed to go to Big Bear with me, so if you just don't mind taking it easy on her when she's in your... possession. How about this, you drug and kidnap her? Clean up the piss, the vomit. Sit in the goddamn van all day... while I go do the fucking, the cuddling, and the laying up. Huh? How about it? If you wanna call this one off, man, I'm down. Oh, no, no, no. Definitely not calling this one off. Mm-mm. Whatever happens... I just... I want to be with you, and I'll give up the things I have here and everything. What do you mean, "Whatever happens"? Uncharted waters, I guess. Hey, sweetheart, where are you? Uh, this isn't your wife. Who the hell is this? Look, Rebecca and I been having an affair. I swear to God, I am going to kill you! We left L.A. a day ago. I woke up this morning. I went for a run. I just got back, and she's not here. And there was a note. "$50,000 in cash or she dies. Tell no one, or she dies." It's got an address. It says, "Bring money and her phone. 7:00 a.m." Text me the address. You stay right there. I'm gonna be there in five hours. Where's this note? You know... my wife's cheating on me with you, and I'm sitting here sharing a bottle with you. Make no sense. Look, we need to talk about what we're gonna do tomorrow. Mmm. Oh, shi... Ow! Hey, you know, I wonder if that woman ever loved me. You know she's gonna leave you, too, right? She's just a manipulative bitch, anyway. You don't know that yet. You ain't learned that yet, but I have. Oh, hell, it don't matter. We all end up alone, anyway. You know, we forgot to go to the bank. The money's in the back. What do we do now? Just relax. Okay, here. Whoa. Take the keys out of the ignition and throw them out the window. Yeah, no, we want to see her first. No. Put the fucking blindfold on! Keys. Here, tie this around your waist. Tight. - Do you have the money? - Yes. Wait up. What are you doing? - What are you doing? - What do you think I'm doing? What the... Look, just... I'll go. You just don't do anything stupid. Yeah, well, that's the least you can do. - Now! - Pop the trunk, would you? - What's happening? - That's it. Keep going. Keep walking to me. That's it. I'm here. Just follow my voice. That's it. Keep walking. Go to your husband. 10 more feet. 10 more feet. I'll shoot her. Get the fucking money! This way. Go, go. Frank! Frank! Frank! Frank, help! Frank, help! - You're okay? - Yeah. When you think that you know someone. I mean, really know someone that you want to be with, and you find out they've been lying to you the whole time... I don't know what to say about him. I don't know where he could be. Why don't you tell me something about him? Why can't you find him? Is there anything else you can tell me? It felt so real at the time. He had really convinced me that we were in love. I had no idea that people were capable of such terrible things. I'll describe him for you as best I can. The gun, the van... The most of the time, he was wearing a mask. He was a black guy. And I was most of the time blindfolded. How do people even become such animals? He even took my wedding ring. I just feel sorry for the next poor girl. Can you tell us anything? Anything at all? A name? I told you everything that I know. I don't want to keep reliving this anymore. I just want you to find them. I know, and we will. Look, thank you for coming in. Okay, it really does help. A lot. All four victims have one major thing in common. It's the same lover. This guy takes each and every one of them on these romantic getaways where they're kidnapped, right? He contacts their husband for the ransom. Ransom note says if you contact the police, she's dead. Look at this. Three separate sketches from three different victims. Sierra Nevada, San Simeon, Ojai, Palm Desert. It's the same guy. Find a match. You find this creep yet? Not yet. The only way to draw these guys out is to set them up by going undercover. Elaborate, Detective. Well, we become their next marks. Dress up in the fancy clothes. We got the rich husband, Frank. We make them believe that their conning us. Get them vulnerable, you know? Make them believe in the illusion, and then when the time is right, we move in. All the victims met this guy at high-end restaurants. Mostly Brentwood, Beverly Hills. We target this guy when he's on the prowl for his next victim, and that's when we assume our roles as rich husband and wife. And tell me why we shouldn't just save the department time and money and take this guy down now? These guys are too smart, sir. We hav to catch them in the act. Both of them. I mean, the guy in the van who's drugging these women, we have to get him. You know, sir, I do agree with that. Go on. The crimes are happening outside of the county. I mean, technically, if we bust them, we have to catch them in the act, right? - But more importantly... - Get them within our county so we can make the arrest. You're sure about this? Yes, sir. And you're all right with this, Frank? Yes, sir. Well, then, get on it before the Feds get wind. I don't want them taking credit for this. - Yes, sir. - Hold on. Tell me more about this Shead guy. Well, Patrick Shead. He, uh, his father relocated the family to the States when he got a new job, but shortly after that, he made some bad investments, went bankrupt. Mother leaves his father for his business partner, disappears. His father sinks into a deep depression, alcoholism. Suffers an untimely death, leaving a young Patrick to fend for himself. 18, he slides into a life of petty crime, all nonviolent offenses. 14 years and several small convictions, he's sent to Lompoc. He spent about two and a half years there. He just got released on good behavior. He's teamed up with what we think is a known associate, and they've been pulling these cons ever since. What are we doing, man? What the fuck are you doing? You got too sloppy, falling for the mark. Give me the burner. Yeah, here. I'm taking the rest. Now, get the fuck out. You serious? Is this your plan all along? You did it to yourself. You're really doing this? Don't make me say it again. That was good work, Detective. It's not over yet. Look, go home. Get some sleep. No chance. We have our proof. Let's go make the arrest. Let us know when they land. - I want to wrap this up. - Yes, sir. - Detective? - It's him. Does he still buy your cover? Yeah. Answer it. Joe, is that you? Rebecca... there's a few things that I haven't really been upfront with you about. I really would prefer to tell you in person. I'm at Union Station. I'm going to go to a motel near the airport tomorrow, and I'll give you a call then. I look forward to seeing you. Bye. Joe... Everything okay? He's at Union Station. He leaves tomorrow, LAX. Whoa, GPS just landed at the Toy District. How accurate is that? - Accurate. - Patrick's... Shead's lying. He's just trying to throw us off. Hold up. You're gonna stay here on this one. Get some rest. Saddle up. Take it easy. Hey, excuse me, sir? Just a minute. I need to talk to you. Sir? Hey, stop! Stop, LAPD! Stop! Freeze! Freeze! Hey! Freeze! Freeze, mother fucker! - Freeze! - Drop it! Freeze! Drop it! Drop it! Hey, it's me. I'm at the Buena Vista Hotel near the airport. Yeah. Room 406. Okay, see you soon. Good morning. Was that him? I know you're heavily invested in this case, but... I'm fine. Let's just get this done. 1-26. All units proceed with caution. Patrick? Hello? Patrick? Are you there? It's me. Hello? What the fuck? All clear! Check under. We're all clear. Dinner's gone out. 10-26. The room's empty. Are you sure he gave you the right room number? He can't run forever. I'm sorry that we only got the one. Well, you did some really good work here, Rebecca. I'm gonna recommend you for a promotion, and I'm gonna make sure that you get it. Thank you, sir. Now, we're officially turning this case over to the Bureau. So you can go home. Spend some time with your family. Could I take you to, um, another special place when we get back? Another time? What's wrong with this place? Nothing. There's nothing wrong with this place, just, um... it's like a little resort. You're moving really fast for me. That's not a no. It does sound nice. I know I am moving very quickly, but I don't know, I just never felt this way about anyone before, and... I really do like you. Yes, I'll go. You will? You really believe we can just switch out our lives? The decisions we've already made this late in the game? I mean, you really think we can change? We certainly can't have it both ways. Patrick.
