Jesse James was a lad who killed many a man. He robbed the Glendale train. He took from the rich and give to the poor. He'd a heart and a hand and a brain. That alarm bell's something new. They must have stayed up all night trying to figure out a way to discourage us. Sorry I dropped the money. Forget it. How's it look? Clean through. You know what they say, when you save a man's life you assume his responsibilities. There's only $100 on my head. That ain't much when you say it fast. We got a long ways to go. Think you can hang on? Sure, where we going? Home. It ain't I'm not charitable. But Bob Ford's all healed and now able to get. It says in the paper they're selling a handsome cuspidor secured by a screwed... He just spells trouble, him and his brother, Charlie. Why don't they leave you alone? You got out of the wrong side of the bed all week, see. I ain't been to bed since you carried Bob in here with a bullet in his back. He's a good boy. Been riding with me for a length of time. Been living here for a length of time too. Six months. Don't mind your brother, Frank, but them Fords... You've been a devoted wife, Zee. And I don't say that you speak falsely. I promise, right after the... What is it, Jess? I only see one rider, Charlie Ford. You can look at that map now if you want to. I spoke my peace. What's ailing her? It's funny. I wonder what happened. Why didn't Frank ride in with you? He stayed behind to study the roads we'll have to use. We picked a good bank in Dodge City. The four of us can handle it without any trouble. No alarm bells this time. When are to meet him? 11 Days from today. The bank will be fat. He'll be here, the West Bank of the Arkansas River, a couple of miles from Wichita. Thought you might be hungry. Thanks, Zee. May as well sit. We're going to eat. I stopped by in town to find out what was new. Guess who's there, Bob? Your girl. Cynthy? In Saint Joe? Yep. Still play acting too, at the opera house. Had a show last night, I was told. If you're recognized, Bob... They don't know us in Saint Joe, Mr. Howard. Watch out for Marshal Craig. And don't get into a gun fight. That's not my intention. You love Cynthy, don't you? Since I was old enough to crawl. Then why don't you marry her and settle down and buy land? You're a farmer at heart. We all are. By the way, Cynthy, there's a very good friend of mine, a gentleman... well, someone I know. And he's seen the show every night this week. He says... We only opened last night. Yes, and so... so he did. Well, maybe he saw the rehearsals. Anyhow, he's most anxious to see you. And he says... Oh, Veronica, will you make up some more of that sugar and water? I didn't like the stuff Harry picked. Well, look, he's a very important man. He's the Silver King of Colorado or something. And he... he feels... Harry, how could you expect anyone to back our show if they've seen it? Well, he's very fond of heartwarming dramas. Well, thanks. Oh, a little more water, please. Now look, how would it be if I brought him here sometime this week? I you like. Maybe tomorrow or tonight, or just a minute. Mr. Kelley? Yes? Kelley, this is Miss Waters. Veronica? How do you do, Miss Waters? Mr. Kelley. Well, what do you favor? Light opera? Oh, um... Uh, heavy opera? Oh yes, I uh, do... Maybe heartwarming dramas. Well, that... Don't forget Lille Langtry. Of course, Lillie Langtry. Oh, please, Cynthy, we... Miss Waters, Mr. Kane, you don't know this, but I've seen a lot of your shows. I saw you in "Joplin." Maybe Kansas City? Oh yes, yes, Kansas City. - Jefferson City too, huh? - Oh yes, Jefferson City too. - That's fine. - Yes, yes. Seen lots of your shows. All bad. but don't let that bother you, Miss Waters. I'm sure it wasn't your fault or Mr. Kane's. Just bad plays. But I'd like to talk to you a little more. Maybe I could see you after the show, hmm? Mr. Kelley, if you're going to put a nickel in this show you'll lose it. Oh? We don't make money. Oh, Cynthy. What is it, Veronica? It's Mr. Miller. He's outside. Hello, Harry. Now, they want you outside, Harry. Cynthy. Oh, Mr. Kelley, Mr. Miller. Hello, Miller. Oh, are you a member of the company here? No, my business is prospecting. I didn't hear. I like Miss Waters acting very much. Do you have a match, Mr. Miller? Miss Waters, don't be worried about me losing any money on your show. I don't have any. But I'd still like to talk to you again. Cynthy. Cynthy Waters. If you'd listened to me three years ago, we could've been married. You're a good farmer. Farmer? After the next I... And what if lead poisoning sets in first? When I marry it won't be to a man on the run. Cynthia... Look at Jesse's wife. Last time I saw her hiding out in a mountain cabin. She looked 50 instead of 30. I don't want that kind of a life. Maybe... maybe you don't feel for me the way she feels about Jess. I'm still Missouri. Bob? Yeah? When you're free I'll marry you. All right. I'm leaving the James gang for good. I know Mr. Merritt. He's the prosecuting attorney of Jackson County. Tell them... tell them I'm going to be a farmer. You were gone long enough to get 10 pardons. What did Meredith say? Pumped Cynthy livid, trying to find out where I'm hiding. Said if I gave myself up he'd see I only got 20 years. 20 years. You think they may have followed you back from St. Louis? No. Where's Jess? Took Zee and the kids to church. Did Meredith tell her what the governor just came out with? Everybody in Saint Joe's been talking about it. Don't seem to worry Jess none. Why? Amnesty for any of the gang who turns in Jess, dead or alive. Amnesty? Yeah, act of pardon. Means if you're on the run and you turn in Jess you're free. No time in jail? Not even a day. And you could walk down the street and nobody'd bother you? Yeah, it means just that. It means I could get married. Yeah. $10,000 goes for that, dead or alive. Means we could buy a farm. Nobody could take Jess alive. That'd be suicide. She wouldn't have to tear up old weed sacks to make herself a pair of drawers. Bob, what are you... I'm thinking of Cynthy. What about Frank, James? What'd you do that for? Meaning I'm afraid of Frank? Ain't ya? Sure. If I want to think I'm afraid I'll say I'm afraid. I'll think it and I'll say it. Nothing gonna stop me from marrying Cynthy. Nothing. Hey Bob! Bob! Hey, hurry up, Bob! That's wonderful, man. That's more like it. It's nice and warm now. Be back in a minute. Bob? Yeah? Pick up that blanket, will you? It's a Colt 45. Improved pattern. Silver-mounted pearl handle. It's beautiful. Loaded. Well, when I give a present I like to make it complete. Well, go ahead, Bob. What are you waiting for? There's my back. Here, scrub it. Hey Bob! I'm going to town. I'll see you in the morning. What are you doing, poking around out there, Bob? Come on in, let's talk. It's kind of lonesome without Frank around. It ain't lawful. Even folks in town what don't like Jesse James is sayin' it ain't lawful. Don't you fret about it, Zee. Its just as if the governor was advertising to hire an assassin to go and kill ya unawares. I ain't killed yet, Zee. I pick my friends and I know 'em. No friend of mine would swallow that immunity offered by the governor. Ain't that... what are you so nervous, fer? Did Cynthy turn you down? Yeah, Yeah, ki... kinda. Think I'll go into Saint Joe and buy a new horse. You can fetch the children home from school with ya. Yeah, I'll do that, Zee. I'm tired. I guess maybe Zee's right. Time I settle down. That's what you want to do, Bob. Get yourself a wife and a home. That's what I'm aiming to do, Jess. Well, It's only 11 o'clock. Think I'll wait until later this afternoon to go in town. It's an awful hot day. I feel kind of naked without my weapons. No sir, nothing like putting around a home. There's no $10,000. The governor didn't conspire with you to assassinate Jesse. The reward is $5,000 for his apprehension, $5,000 for convection. All you'll get is $500. Bob, you ought to see the way that folks looked at me when I walked down the street. You ought to see 'em, Bob. That $10,000? $500. What happened to the rest of it? What's the difference? I got enough to buy Cynthy a ring, a diamond ring, a great big one. You can be best man. Oh, not me. I'm not hanging around waiting for a ball from Frank James's gun. A buckshot from some of the folks what don't like what happened to Jess. You scared? He'll get you, Bob. He'll get both of us. I'm riding out. Stake me, Bob? Here's $100. Thanks, bob. Watch yourself. Yeah. I still got enough to buy Cynthy a big diamond ring. Miss Waters? Miss Waters? I beg your pardon. It's Kelley, John Kelley. I was talking to the manager, Mr. Kane. He told me you changed your mind. You're not going to leave the show. I'm glad to hear it. If there's something troubling you, Miss Waters, can I help? I'm living at the North Hotel, if there's anything I can do to help. John Kelley, North Hotel. Cynthy? What's the matter? How could you have done it? Jesse, your best friend. How, Bob? How? I didn't do it for the reward. I know! I know! I know. Then why you looking at me like I'm poison? Can't you understand what's happened? You got me kind of all mixed up. When you pulled that trigger, all the love I had for you... But I done it for you. Oh say that... don't ever say that. Well it's true, Cynthy. Can't you see how wrong it was? It was legal. It was murder. Don't look at it that way. You ought to be proud of me. The governor's grateful. The law says it's legal. Don't look at it no other way. What other way can I look at it? Cynthy, I ain't on the run now more. I can walk down the street and nobody, not even the whole militia, can bother me. That's what the shooting means to you. What it means to me, it means I'm a free man. Ain't that what you wanted, Cynthy? Ain't it? T'weren't easy shootin' Jess. It weren't easy. But there's nothin' I wouldn't do to have you. Your wedding ring. I can't. Cynthy! You're hurting me! What do you think you're doin' to me? Listen, Cynthy, when I killed Jess I had a cause. If you turn against me, I got no reason. The way you did it, Bob, well, can't you understand? The love I had for you... No, t'ain't that. Somethin' else has turned you from me. Ain't a murderer. So there's got to be a reason. Kelley, that's who it is. Kelley. You're talking crazy. What was he doin' to you when I came in? Did you see him much when I was in jail? Stop it! I knew there had to be a reason. I knew. Bob, you're wrong about Kelley! he's got nothin' to do with us! Come in. You've got to leave Saint Joe at once, right away. I have to what? I... Bob Ford's going to kill you. Yeah? Why? Because he thinks we're in love. Oh he does, huh? Yes. How does he know? There's not time to waste. You've got to leave. Is that... is that an order? Well, it's a fact that'll save your life. Or uh, his? Please, Mr. Kelley. Now, just a minute, Miss Waters, we hardly know each other up till now. There's no time to... Well, you're not giving me any chance to get to know you. You barge in here and tell me I have to run away just because that hot-headed Ford says we're lovers. Don't make sense. His guns do. Yeah, that does give him quite an edge. He's dangerous. Why? Because he killed his best friend? Look, I'm telling you to go because I don't want any more bloodshed. He's jealous and... Was, uh, Jesse James in love with you too? It was for the amnesty. And not the reward. He wanted to be free to marry me. Look, we're wasting time. He's on his way up here now, looking for you. I don't think he'll shoot unless I turn my back. He killed Jesse James because of me. He didn't want money. He wanted me. Just as if I'd pulled that trigger myself. And now he thinks we're lovers. Oh don't you see, Mr. Kelley? I don't want any more murders because of me. Please help me. I'm sorry, I didn't understand. Then you'll go at once, right now? Do you love him? Yes. I don't believe you. You couldn't love him. I don't like what I'm doing but if it's what you want, it's good enough for me. Come on. 8? 10. Well, there goes another four bits. So you really know the whole clan, hmm? All of 'em. The mother of the Dalton boys was Adelaide Younger, half sister of the Younger brothers. Cousins of the James boys. 6. 9. So they're all kind of related. Just one big family. Cole and Jim and Bob and John Younger, and Grant and Emmett Dalton, and Frank and Jess, and Jim Reed and Belle Starr, and their son. 4. 8. Just having a run of bad luck. Yeah. Uh, would you mind letting me look at that 0.45 now? You know, this gun will probably end up in a museum someday. Not while I'm alive to tell it. Um, curtain will go up the usual time. You better hurry up. I... I mean, take your time. I'll see you later. I'll be around. I been waitin' for ya, Cynthy. I'm sorry for what I said. I was wrong about Kelley. He checked out of town. You ain't sore are you? No. You know, I've been thinking about us and it's wrong for us to get married now. I know what you were trying to tell me without hurting my feelings. Do you, Bob? Sure, it ain't right for a man to get married if he ain't got enough money to take care of his wife. So I got myself a job. On a farm? No. Well, whatever it is, I'm proud of you. Well, I hope you feel that way when I tell you what it is. Do you want me to guess? I'm going to be a performer. And I'm going to ride Jumbo in Barnum's Circus in New York. No, Mr. Kane and I talked it over. I'm going to be what he called a... a special added attraction. Well? Well, every night I'm going to... I'm going to show folks how I shot Jess. No. That's what I aim to do. Have you lost your mind? How can you put yourself up like... like a freak? People will pay... I don't care about people. I'm talking about you, Bob Ford. How do you feel about it? You mean you're going to use Jesse as a... oh, Bob. What's the difference? He's dead. I got to make money so we can get married. And farming will take too long. Look, I don't regret what I done because it was to have you. I don't regret what I aim to do because the whole thing's kind of tied up in one big crazy. I... I can't stomach you using Jesse's ghost. You're right about that, Cynthy. Look, I ain't much good with words. But seems to me that real honest love is like ghosts, which everybody hears about and few people see. Well, I see it. I feel it and I got it. If that can't make you see what's driving me on, nothing can. I just want a chance to prove I ain't no murderer, traitor, or assassin. It's a hot day. I think I'll dust off some of these pictures. Blank. A wandering minstrel man I am. I sing my songs in trade. And in the course of traveling, my fortune I have made. If I sing a lilt near to any purty miss, even though she maybe shy, she pays me with a kiss. Now in this room, I feel an urge to tell you what I think. If someone pays the cost I'll trade a ballad fer a drink. Give him a drink. I just blew into town. I could use a drink, mister. I'll sing you one everybody likes. A song everybody likes. Jesse James was a lad that killed many a man. He robbed the Glendale train. He took from the rich and give to the poor. He'd a heart and a hand and a brain. Young Jesse had a wife who mourned for his life, three children, they were brave. But the dirty little coward what shocked Mr. Howard has laid Jesse dead in his grave. Cause it was Robert Ford, the dirty little cow... anything wrong, mister? I'm Robert Ford. Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Ford. I didn't know. So everybody like it, eh? Oh, nobody likes it very much, Mr. Ford. Go on singing. Oh, please, Mr. Ford. I want to hear it. Cause it was Robert Ford, the dirty little cow... I can't. Sing it. Cause it was Robert Ford, the dirty little coward. Wonder how he feels. He ate of Jesse's bread and slept in Jesse's bed. Then he laid Jessie dead in his grave. Jesse James sat at home on a Saturday night, talking to his family, brave. Robert Ford come around like a thief in the night and laid Jesse dead in his grave. No man you ever saw on the side of the law could take Jesse dead or alive. T'was his friend, Robert Ford, who collected that reward by shooting Jesse James on the sly. Young Jesse had a wife who mourned for his life. Three children, they were brave. But the... dirty little coward what shot Mr. Howard had laid Jesse dead in his grave. Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Don't shoot! I'm out of bullets. Why pick me for target practice? You shot Jesse James. Anybody would shoot you becomes the biggest gunman in the country. Silver! Silver! Silver! Silver! A lot of it! Creede, Colorado! Woo! Silver! Silver! Silver! Colorado! Creede, Colorado! I wanted to find you. You've got to get out of town. I overheard some men talking. You're the target for every gun-happy man around here. They think killing you will make them famous. It isn't safe for you here anymore. It'll be the same wherever I go. You could change your name. No, I'm not going to do what Jesse did. But you can't go on like this. Every minute I expect someone to shoot you. So do I. Well what are we going to do, Bob? Well, there's a silver strike in Colorado. Maybe if I go there, I might... Please? No, I'm not going to change my name. Oh, I didn't mean that. What did you mean? It's about us. Cynthy, it might take a short time. Might take long. If I strike it rich I'll send for you. But Bob, I... I'm leaving tonight. Howdy, mister. Howdy. My horse is beat. - Brush him off. - I'll do that. Feed him too. I'll feed him. You got a clean stall for my horse? Why, sure. You look like you could use a clean stall yourself. Where do I find one? There's not a room in the whole town, mister, unless you can talk yourself into one down at the Silver King. And that's down the street, to the left. You can't miss it. It's a sure thing. It's worth a million. Now, if I could just start right along at this rate... Sorry, lucky, nobody'll stake you on that piece of ground. Well, would you loan me a half dollar? No. You owe too much already. How about a room? Filled up, unless you want the bridal suite, $100 a night. Say, how'd you like to sell that ring? I got a little more than $40. How about that room? Well, or doubling up. If you can get the fella here in 124 to share his with you it'll be $10 for the night. Where is it? Upstairs to the right. It's open. Hey, I know you. You're... you're Kelley. Aye, Miller. Hi, I got no place to sleep. You mind if I share your room? It's big enough. Help yourself. How're things in Saint Joe? Quiet. I guess everybody and his brother is in town. That's the way these booms are. It's lucky it's this time of year. No snow on the ground. Makes it easier to find the veins. This your first crack at it? Yeah. You're going to find it pretty rough, Miller. There's a lot of old timers here know every rock and hole in Colorado. Well, before I share your room, I ought to tell you, my name ain't Miller. That's none of my business. I ain't ashamed of it. It's Ford, Robert Ford. How about the room? It's still big enough. You uh, through with this? No, leave it there. ...beating madly, I love you. Somewhere... Yep, the boys have been talking about you again, Mr. Kelley. Everybody likes you and... No chance. It's good paying money. I can make you a Marshall in five minutes. I've been kicking around too long to hang up in one place. Is that what you want? Ending up like most of these broken down sourdoughs? I got no reason to stick around this town. Sure wish you'd change your mind. All the storekeepers think highly of you. Joe, all peacemakers are targets. That's not for me. What have you got to eat? Sweet corn, corn meal mush, corn pone with cracklings and corn whiskey. I'll have it. Beautiful dreamer, wake unto me, darling... Say it. You remember Cynthy Waters? Yeah. I remember. I'm going to bring her back a mountain of money. Is that what she wants? Mhm. We're going to get married when I strike it. Beautiful dreamer, queen of my song, lest while I woo thee, with that melody. Gone are the cares of... That's what Cynthy used to sing to me. ...life's busy throng. Beautiful dreamer, awake unto me. Beautiful dreamer, awake unto awake unto me. Yahoo! Yahoo! I made it! Yahoo! Kelley! Kelley, m'lad, I made it! Look at it. That tote will carry $200! Yahoo! Be careful now, Soapy, be careful. Don't let anybody know where. You're drunk. Sure I'm drunk. Come on, let's all get drunk. Aye, Soapy. A jug of your best for my friend, Soapy. Those men with him, do you know 'em. No. Looks like they're going to strike it rich tonight too. Well, a man gets that drunk it's his own neck. Whiskey. All you got to do is sign, Soapy, and we give you $500 in cash. So what? We're buying your rights for $500. In cash. Remember? Hmm? Oh yeah, sure, sure. Come on, Soapy. I'm gonna take you home. Go on, Kelley, give it to 'em! Ah! I don't like you pulling on a gun on a man what ain't got one. That's his own fault. Anything can happen to a man when he ain't got his guns. That old drunk there, if you want his mine, why don't you shoot him and take it? I don't like a man going around the back way and pulling a sneak. Kelley, you're great. Come on, Soapy. I'm going to take you home. Yahoo! Yahoo! Where's Kelley? He got up early. Where's he go? He checked out. Where's Kelley? Nobody tells anybody where they're working a claim. I ain't anybody. He stole my ring. Kelley wouldn't. He checked out. Bring me some coffee. Heard what you did for me last night, Mr. Ford, and I want to tell you it was decent of you. And you're wrong about Kelley. I think maybe if you... Who asked you to think? You're here to make a strike, ain't you? You got a piece of ground? Ever do any prospecting? You know, for an old man, you ask a lot of questions. Yep, I guess you're right. Everybody wants to live long but nobody wants to be old. I'm old and a little tired. Well, I just left a bed. You can have it. No, I mean tired of working my mind. I was thinking maybe you... Look, you don't have to give me a reward for shooting them two fellas. Who said anything about a reward? You'll have to work. And you can't tell. We're liable to run into Kelley anywhere along the river. What do you want to cut me in for? You struck it. What do you need anyone for? The bartender told me why you was here for diggings. Most of us just want the money. You want it to get hitched. That's the highest point in a man's life, Mr. Ford, getting hitched. What are you driving at? There ain't no place so high that you can't reach it with a borrowed load of pay dirt. You know, you don't look like a man that makes much sense. But you sure do. Why sit here eating your heart out, waiting for a man you think stole your ring, when you got a chance to win gold and wear it or hoard it or spend it or lend it or lose it, or use it to get hitched? I got nothing to work with. You got hands. Better than the hardtack, ain't it? "And I shot that mountain lion, which was only 20 feet behind Soapy. We've been digging for weeks, and we're going to keep on digging. Nighttime is when it's... well, it's night time." What'll you do if he does strike it rich? I don't know. I don't remember if it was Shakespeare or Aristotle, but one of them once said, "No one loves the man whom he fears." Telegram. For me? No, for you, Miss Cynthy. I seen you wear black before, but now it kind of makes you seem taller. Hello, Bob. Yeah, but not taller maybe. You're looking kind of different. Perhaps I'm tired. Yeah. Now your telegram said you'd be arriving at 6:00. It was the other way around. I said we'd be leaving at 6:00. Yeah, I got... I'm kind of mixed up. Oh, I see you brought him with you. Oh, Harry a little tough luck in Saint Joe. And he thought for... Well, long as this is a boom town, maybe they'd like to pay money for a real heartwarming drama. Yeah, well I hope you got yourself a new leading lady, Harry. Cause Cynthy and I, we... come on, I got a surprise for you. What's the matter, Cynthy? Don't you like it? I guess you're all wore out from the trip. You know, I sent to Denver for a dressmaker to make your wedding dress. Oh, you've gone to a lot of trouble, Bob, and I... You know, people see us courtin', it'll be the biggest wedding in... oh, it ain't the truth that's tired you. Something bothering you. You know, when something bothers us, we got to talk things out, when something bothers us. Come in. Go on. All right, tell him. I stole your ring when you went to sleep that night. Give it to him. Go on. Get out of here. Don't ever call me a thief. He can put that ring on your finger now, Mrs. Ford. I'm not Mrs. Ford yet. You go freshen up. You must be tired, huh? I'll fix up a room for Kane and myself. Go freshen up. That clerk shot out of here like a bullet. I knowed the minute you blew back you'd clear that up. He did the same thing last year in Jefferson City. When you grabbed him behind his desk, I sure thought he was a dead one. How'd you make out with your claim? No good. You shoulda' come in with me and Ford. He's rich now, real rich. You need any grubstaking? Nope. You got any money? You're going out to hammer them hills again? Got a cigar? Sure. How long did you say it would take to make me Marshall? Five minutes. You better tell your friends. A fella's gotta eat. Let me have my bag. You got a reason to stay in town now, eh? Yep. Hey, did you see the bride? She's no bride yet. Veronica, better wait with those bags. Have you told him yet? I couldn't. Why are you wasting time? I'm not particularly fond of him. But even a traitor like Bob Ford... Harry. Yes, even he deserves consideration. Well it isn't easy. Well of course it isn't easy. But you've got to tell them the truth. Tell him that you're on your way to Denver, that we're going to open a new show. Cynthy, Perhaps I've exaggerated now and then about your acting ability. But your honesty, that's a quality I've always admired from you. Thank you, Harry. So you'll tell him you're not going to marry him. Now. I can't. Why? Why? Why can't you? I'm afraid of him. All right, Veronica, you can take the bags in. Well, I... I guess I'm stuck in this town too. You heard him, Veronica. I bought her 20 dresses and... say, you ought to try getting married too, Soapy. Mr. Soapy, think what we could do here. I'm offering you a chance to invest in the first professional theater in the town of Creede. Well, how much gold would it take? We could make it a double wedding, just you and me and... Gold is nothing but the last corruption of degenerate men. But to be just a little corrupt, for the sake of art, that I wouldn't mind. How much? You... I bought her hats and dresses and shoes. How much gold will it take? Now you're talking like an intelligent bachelor. Anyone can get married. Mr. Soapy, I just want... I just... I just wanted to... Hello. Hello. You're going to marry him tomorrow? Well, not tomorrow. You're not ever going to marry him because I won't let you. Pack up. You can't come in here and tell me what to do. You didn't let that stop you when you ordered me out of Saint Joe. You're making it worse for me. Cynthy, we don't need talk to understand each other. You don't love him. I can't hurt him. Then why did you come here? Tell me. Well, I... Why? I wanted to tell him to his face. What were you going to say? What were you going to say? What? I'm sorry for you. I could never marry you. I don't love you, Bob. I don't love you. I really don't love you. I don't love you, Bob. I don't love you. I really don't love you. I don't love... Cynthy, it's Kelley. Oh, Kelley. It's Veronica. She's not here. Frank! Frank James. Hello, Cynthy. Sit down. Sit down, Mr. Kelley. I'm looking for you. I'm looking for Bob Ford. Tried to climb into Bob's room, but his window was locked. - If you kill him, you'll hang. - Shut up. Sit down. Though I didn't mean to listen to what you were saying, Cynthy, I got a little reckless and knocked over a bottle of perfume. Ain't used to female things, you know? I know how you feel, James... Shut up. Soon as we hear the verdict we'll get back to work. I still can't figure out how Kelley got the best of Frank James. Mr. Kelley happens to be a very... well, he's a very smart man. What do you think they'll give Frank? 10 years maybe? I don't know. What number do you... what number do you want to rehearse? Maybe 20 years, maybe. They'll never keep him in jail, Bob. He's been there a week, but they won't keep him long. You're right. The trial is over. Waiter? How many years did he... He's free. I don't understand. There was a price on his head. There is, Bob, but not in Colorado. I don't have to kill you. But I'm going to tell you something that will kill you. You're aiming to marry Cynthy. When you put your lips up close to her, she'll be kissing you. But she'll be thinking of Kelley. It's you she's sorry for. But it's him she wants. Anyone see the Marshal? I kept away because of you. But I... I don't like this hiding game. Everybody knows what he'll do the minute he sees you. Well, I've got to figure out some way to talk to him. But he's crazy with jealousy. I'm not going to run away from something I want. Then take me away. Anywhere. Let's leave right away... You wouldn't like that. Do you want to spend the rest of your life behind a bolted door? They tell me Ford's on his way over here. Well, I got to talk to him. He'll kill you. I've got to try and talk some sense into him. I hope what I'm going to do now turns out right. For all of us. I hope so. Someday you'll need my love at last. You got your back to me, Kelley! Turn around! Turn around, Kelley! Turn around! I ain't waitin' Kelley! Turn around! Kelley! Turn around! Go on, shoot. I ain't waiting, Kelley! Turn around! Keep away from your gun and listen. I'm listening. I was hoping I could talk some sense into you without the help of... I'm still listening. She's not going to marry you. She came here to tell you that. We both love her. You in your way and me... me in my way. Some men will kill for a woman. Some won't. You won't cause you don't love her enough. He just wouldn't listen to me. Oh, Cynthy. Shh. I want to tell you something I ain't ever told anyone. Oh Bob. I'm sorry for what I done to Jess. I loved him.
