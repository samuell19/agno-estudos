Where do you want to go, Miss? Are you going to Hannover? With you? Of course. - Get in. - Sure. But my friend must also come. Dear God, another one? Okay, get in, both of you. This'll be a comfortable ride, no? With this heat we could use some refreshment, no? Cigarette? Give your friend one too, so she doesn't get grumpy. No, she's dead tired, she'll sleep. I like taking people along. - One can share the fuel costs... - But I have no money. Who says money? With a body like that... Just seeing these damn motorbikes... The scum of earth. You get nervous? - Well, them? - Yeah, very much. I'll try to shake them off. We can't get rid of them! Finally. Some peace and quiet now. Get out now! Don't resist or I'll kick your ass - shut up! Not so clever now, huh? Wallet now! Want me to help you?! Will you... Can I drive on now? Be happy, you'll lose a few kilos walking! Had your little adventure now? Quick, I was robbed! Money, car - all gone! - You can still get them! - Get into the car then. Turn off the motor. Why, what's up? Should've given way, you know? Yeah, well, it's night... - Who cares, sarge? - Show me your license. Please. Here's a ticket, 3 mark, so that you'll learn from this. You'd rather be charged? I'll just pay, if I can. Did a grey Kapitän just pass? Was that a Kapitän before? Didn't see, why? It was involved in a robbery. 10 minutes ago, near kilometer 13. One woman and three men. Two of them on motorbikes. What about him? Traffic violation. Didn't you come from AVUS too? Yeah, from Wannsee. Didn't you tail that car with the other bike? Didn't notice, I'm alone. Was he with them? Do you recognize him? Can't say, gentlemen. It's possible, sure. I don't know, I was blinded. Follow us, young man. We'll investigate this case. Dude, make-up all over your face. You still owe me 1.60 from yesterday. I'm telling you, he's not here. Don't know if or when he'll come. Still missing a penny. - Do you know where he is, I need to, I need to... - No! - Tell him, I need him. - Yes, fine, I'll do it. - I need him... - I'll tell him if he ever comes back! Thank you so much, thank you! Thanks. - Hey, 6 cognacs is 9.90! - It's fine, put it on the tap. Thanks, thanks... Get me another double, same bill. So, how was it? - Exciting? - It's all routine, professor. Maybe I'll join one, soon? You're still green behind the ears, boy. Our newcomer. Doing well, isn't he? Werner's coming. At last. Hope that's it for today. I'm beat too. Working all day, out all night. - Well? - Still need us tonight? No, we'll call it a day. - I'm good with that. - Okay, that's done. Nice gathering, inconspicuous too. Go, drink's on me, professor. - Where's Rob? - Caught. Traffic police. Once again, this idiot. - Hope he won't talk. - No, he's solid. Oh, pretty good. 220? No, Opel Kapitän. Where'd you leave it? Side street, Halensee. - See you tomorrow. - See you. The old man's been here. - Needs something again? - Always, or he wouldn't come. I've got to visit him. - You don't need to. - What I need is my business. If Rob should come, tell him to wait for me. All good, professor? Go and get some sleep then. Tomorrow you're up. Bye. - The old man still owes me. - Yeah, so I've guessed. - Is that enough? - Yes, it's enough. ... for me too. Robert Hahn, 07.08.1937, Berlin. Skilled worker, parents deceased. Current address: "Kolonie Siedlerglück" Huh? All good, thanks. See, detective? It's all in order. - Think I'm lying, when the police knows everything? - Shut up! On the AVUS, at night? Just driving around a bit? - Huh, you can tell your granny. - She's dead. - Don't be cheeky. So... where were you? Well, I've told you. I've had the cylinder head and pistons done. One had to take it out for a ride. - At night, on the AVUS? - Well, I'm working at daytime. Mr. Römer? The Kapitän's been found, Halensee. - Even the key's inside. - Is that so? Well at least the car's there. See, all good now. I've told you not to speak unless asked. Sure, won't say another word then. Yes? Sure, Schmidt, I know. But leave me alone with that press now. We're not sleeping here either. We've doubled the shifts on AVUS, the Heerstraße and Tiergarten. Why, the chief's gone upstairs? Fine, I'll come. The press is out for blood, the boss is getting nervous. He wants results, out of thin air! We must catch those thugs. So, Mr. Thiel. You process this man for now. Don't go easy on him. Don't worry about the old man. What are you riding, the 500? - No, Horex 350. - That's a nice one. - Could be more comfortable. - Nah, I wouldn't say that. One of the boys has one, you'd think it has no saddle. - You're in a little gang then? - Some colleagues and friends. - Well... - An old geezer like that won't understand that. For him it's all scum and thugs. I've shown him some new records recently. Louis Armstrong and so on, didn't fit up there with him. - You know Charlie Brown? - Charlie Brown? - Just bought it, nice piece. - Already paid off your bike? - Why? - Just asking. - A few more rates. - Nice. Listen up, kid. You see we're speaking the same language. If you're ever worried... Know the Zoo kiosk? Mhm, I know it. I eat there every day. Around 5pm, after work. I talk to the boys, about their worries. One got in deep, now he's got cold feet. Other one was nailed, you know. The way to police is still best, if it ever comes to that... Prison's a dark place. Clear? Hm, I get it. Cheers to you, doctor. You need it. Not looking so well. When I think about the man you've been. And now... You'll develop a nice paranoia, if you continue like that. It'll start with... Diffuse softenings, the decay of the cerebellum, and then it's over! It'd be a pity, doctor, no? Since you're my only patient. Now... ... next please! Next please! Next please! Good evening, father. Back at it again, huh? Do you need to drink this poison? Want to destroy yourself? What else should I do? I didn't even have a penny left. Give me some, once more. Help me one last time. Did you pay rent at least? Dear Lord, the money one spends on you. It's like a bottomless pit. So... this is rent. Allowance. And if you must drink, at least buy something normal. [slurring] I... I thank you. Nonsense, get a hold of yourself. And don't come to Splendid. Don't want to see you there, got it? Now go and sleep. Sleep... I can't sleep anymore. I walk around the flat all night. I can't sleep anymore. Sometimes I think... It's not right up here. Stay... stay here... Werner, stay... - Stay with me tonight. - No, no, no... I can't take the air here. Come, I'll take you to bed. - See, up there? - Ah, yeah! Rudi and the professor. Already off work? Maybe due to the heat. Ah, no, they've got shorter shifts. Should also be like that here. These damn 8 hour shifts. Breakfast, lunch and commute it's almost 10 hours. What's even left of the day then? I like working up here. Nice view and nice air here. For 2.38 an hour? What you earn in 2 months here, you earn with Werner in a night. - Want to be a millionaire? - Why not? I want to buy a petrol station in a few years. One with 4 pumps, get it? Then I'll be behind the register, just cashing in all day. Tell me, Fritz. Have you ever considered something going sideways? Sideways? With Werner...? Never. Why do you ask? I don't know. Got a bad feeling when they caught me yesterday. I know it's not easy, gentlemen. But the press isn't entirely wrong. 4 robberies. 2 on AVUS, 1 on Heerstraße and 1 near Tiergarten. The Klermann case... and the robbery on Odeum cinema's register. It's always cash and motorized robbers. There's connections here, it must be an organized gang. But we're still in the dark. I thought we got close yesterday. When we nailed the biker on AVUS. Why didn't you keep him? - Jailed him? - I said that too... - But Thiel let him go. - I don't understand it. - If you catch one- - You catch none. I apologize, chief. I also thought the boy was connected to the AVUS story. But we had no proof. If we had jailed him... It'd just have been a warning to them. If this is really an organized gang, well... The boys are intelligent enough to disappear. - So now we have nothing. - But we do, chief. Contact's been made. The boy's got a soft spot, he's moldy, as they say. He'll come back. Well... good luck then. Go, pick one then. Hurts, doesn't it? More than once, then definitely. Part of business, isn't it? With this rent here, ha! What do you think I'm paying here monthly? I bet, these sharks. You're a gold mine for them, no? Each penny, you hear me? Otherwise it's out of here. And now another's due. Tonight is payment time. Fortune in gambling, that's misfortune in love. Why? That's not true! Good evening. - Hello, good evening! - Rob, you're back from police now? No, just a ticket, 3 mark. Werner's pissed you didn't come last night. Why, it was a bit late. I'm not sure about Rob these days. Look who's there. Looks like a child on holidays still. Hello, Inge. Got kicked out again? - Why? - Wouldn't be here otherwise. Barbara's got no space for me. I told you that you can sleep at my place. See Rob? There's your little flirt from before. - Evening. - Evening. - Want to dance? - If you want to, sure. How premature and childish. Nice to see you again, Inge. Where have you been? Just here and there. Isn't so nice to always hear East German, no? Still live with your friend? Barbara's got a boyfriend now, and I'm just a nuisance there. Rob here? Excuse me. Can I speak to your man? Right after the dance. Now please. A few minutes. Shouldn't you go, Rob? We'll dance, come. I'll be back soon. You seem to have more time than me. Listen here, Rob. 14 days ago, at the petrol station, you- ... got caught by the night guard. Barely got out ahead. A few days later you lose your ID during the cinema heist. 3 days you're gone, fine, you have a private life... And last night that stupid business with the police. Least you could do was follow the traffic rules, no? - Could happen to anyone. - Yeah, once - once! But not when we're- Step outside with me. Come. Come, come. - Stop this at once! - Nothing for the faint-hearted. Stop now, enough. All good now? I asked if all's good? Yeah. Your turn now, professor. Nah, don't worry. - Oh, what do I have to do? - A small test of courage. Now, everyone to tonight's play. The railway depot. Everyone, I said. I'll follow in a minute. Give that to Ruth for everything the boys had. - Still coming tonight? - Could be late. - You have plans? - Yeah. Nervous? Boy, that's exciting. Listen, it's easy. You put your head on the rails, over there. Say... don't you want to do the other part? Could be good for you now. In front of them. So... the one who stays the longest, has the strongest nerves, and those we need, no? Come, get ready, the train will come in a few minutes. Lights off. Hurry, train's coming. - All good, professor? - Yeah. - Nicely done, professor. - Not bad, huh? - Can I join you now? - Sure thing, professor. So, anyone ever makes fun of the boy again... He'll have to answer to me. Now... I'll need three of you. Otto, Fritz and Rudi. I have plans for you. Basement, one hour. What's the plan? We'll go for a drink. - Splendid, victory celebration. - Sure, let's do it. - And then? - Go sleep, what else? Sleep... not tonight. - Another please. - Don't get drunk here. - Werner won't like it. - Leave him be. - Come, I'll pay it. - No, it's done, here. For us discipline is everything, there's no stepping out of line. Everyone keeps their job. It's a nice disguise, see? - Come, we'll leave. - Hey, what is it? Aren't you waiting for Otto? No, I'll go to the cinema with Rob. At this hour? Yeah, Arke's playing till midnight. Listen, during a heist, not a fart. There's only silent war with us. We're clear? A fine Persian carpet, it'd be like the Hilton! Coming to you, soon in this theater. All good, boys? No time to lose, we'll need a car. As heavy as possible, but without sticky doors. - I'm on it, it's a 10 minute job. - Okay, then with the car to... Corner Steindamm/Möllnstraße. - It's the funfair, right? - Yeah. - There we'll wait for you. So, at the funfair in 30 minutes. At the funfair. There's the action. Thousands of Berliners met for the summer festival opening. Good idea with the cinema. I wanted to leave. But where will you really sleep? - I don't know. - Well... You're always welcome at mine. I mean, no need to be scared with me. I know, Rob. Can't cut me some slack this month, Mr. Streicher? If you can't pay rent on time, then you'll have to close. That's the old man's car. Behind it is Otto's bike. Fritz is opposite. As soon as we rammed the car and cashed in the money, Fritz jumps onto Otto's, we'll take the other bike and are out of here. - Clear? - Clear. Police, what now? They'll pass. Herbert 72, arrived on scene. Maybe searching for the stolen car? This doesn't look good, let's leave. Just wait. Just keep smiling... There you go. Otto. If that patrol car doesn't leave, this was for nothing. They're already here. And now? [slurring Charlie Brown song] At last. [slurring Charlie Brown song] Not this too. See you boys... Just around the corner. Shit. What happened? - A traffic accident. - Someone call the police! - Should I stop? - Keep driving! What is it? The damn car glass. This doesn't look good. - Another 5 minutes? - What's the choice? - I'll take you to a doctor. - No... - Shut up and hold on tight! So you live down there? Yeah, the cottage. Come. It's nice here! If I had such a place, the Splendid would never see me. Why not stay then? You'll keep being out at night? I don't know what you do, but I have an idea. No, Rob. That's nothing for me. I understand, I also want to leave them behind. - Why not do it? - It's not that easy, Inge. And if I help you? Maybe. Get back! Drinking again! When one needs you once! Fine! It's all good. Towel. - Where's he? - Already inside. Let's see. Hot water from the stove. Bite your teeth together. Swab. Swab. Shift change at the tower site? - You know I work there? - You told me yourself. - No, I haven't. - Sorry, my bad. Somebody else told me then. So, why are you here? I want out of here. I saved some money and could sell my bike. Thanks. I want to go somewhere, where one can start over. What's stopping you? Just need to start driving. Change your address, Robert Hahn travelling. I know, but... I'm not alone. There's a girl, she's from the East. She's got no papers here. - I want to take her along. - Her name? Inge Zimmermann. Send her to me some time, maybe I can do something. Thanks. So, here's my telephone number. I'm always available. If you want to pay me back. - Does this hurt? - Uh, uh. Okay, that's it. It's soaked through, needs new bandaging. How's the appetite, hungry? Are you thirsty? Some milk? How about a bottle of beer? Few breads, some meat? Need to go to the pharmacy anyway, swabs and penicillin. Got nothing left here. - I'll bring some food. - I'll give you money! No, thanks, it's all good. You know you're damn lucky? If the ligaments had been cut... No one would've been able to fix it. [merchant chanting] How you doing, kid? Ok. - He's not here? - He left for the pharmacy. Tell me... What's with him? You saw him, completely gone. Used to be a great doctor, but now he's on the liquor. Took away his medical license 3 years ago. - Because of drinking? - No, that was later. Someone died under the knife. Negligence the courts said. Since then he's on it. Come here, eat this. But when he's clear, he's still up to speed. - You saw last night. - And now? He can't ever work again? In a few years, if he makes it. I didn't know all this. Nobody's business. Does he know, what we do? Doesn't want to, it's for the better. Finances him, after all. 20 swabs, kapiazole. Schwympartol. - Working again, doctor? - No, no, I'm not. But one needs a home pharmacy. A few more ointments. Cod liver and Ichtyone. And sleeping pills too. Didn't forget anything? I stopped at the market after work. They have everything. - Don't want you to starve here. - Do you always cook yourself? Sometimes, sometimes not. Food's not important. This mess is over now. Now I'll be in charge here. Sure, Inge, but not here. I want to leave, somewhere. I want to take you along... - Don't you want to? - I can't leave here without papers. I know someone who could help. You need to go there. Who is it then? He's with the police. Police? It says the funfair owner's been robbed of 4000 marks. How interesting. Who's not telling the truth? If I say it's not even 2500, then that's the truth, clear? And how much did your father get? Stop, babe. You can't complain, no? I'm just asking. One never knows with you. I don't want to anymore. I'll tell him that. When we started it was all fun and games, but now... I must get out. Then do it, for God's sake. Want me to talk to him? He'll laugh in your face. Laugh in my face? Why? Because I don't want to lose you? What kind of man is that? Who knows? Sometimes I hate him... Sometimes I don't. This can't end well, Rob. One day they'll catch you... It's always the same end. Is it worth it? I have to get out. He'll have to let me go. I now realize how dangerous this all is. Before meeting you, I was never scared. And now? And now... The crickets. It'll rain tomorrow, says the newspaper. What's this nonsense? No excuses, doctor. Get on the scales. - 120 kilos, I bet you. - You're insane, boy. What's this? You're cheating! Doctor, 120 kilo is too much! We'll butcher you at Christmas! - Talking to me like that! - What? - Have to deduct the shoes! - As if! What's going on here? Seems you're better. I need you today. - It's out of the question. - Why, I'm able to go. You can't, what for? - It's my business. - What do you need him for? So he'll stay here. What's the plan? If the doctor could leave us alone for a moment? Well, it's a pity. I really would've needed you. - I'll come anyway. - No, it's for the best. Here's your share, from the fair. Of course you'll also be included today, quietly. Say, where's your pistol? Pistol? Oh, in the basement. Fritz knows where to find it. Werner? - Yes? - Come here. Werner, stop this. Stop what? Can't be a bit more precise? Werner, I never asked what you really do. I don't know it, I admit. But I can also guess. You do horrible, dangerous things. Let's not start pointing fingers here, you or me. It doesn't matter. But listen to me for once! Change your life, please! You can still do it! Get a job, go to work! Get insurance, a bank account? Retire in comfort? Can't wait for that! You always want everything at once! Nobody can wait anymore! Yeah, I don't want to wait! I want to earn now! I want a nice car now, to travel the world now! I want to live now! Not when I'm turning sour! I don't want to think about following these ancient rules! As if nothing had happened. - Do I know what's tomorrow? - But no one knows that. But one can't always live lawless like that! A man needs securities, he needs order in life! Don't look at me like that. - What I am, it's no excuse for you. - I will live the way I want to! Securities, order... you wish! Do I know if I'll be enlisted tomorrow? If some nuke is dropped on my head the day after? You're yesterday's news! - Yes, maybe you're right. - Now leave me alone! Mind your own business, you're busy enough with that. So, professor, excited? Well, a bit. It's the first time after all. But Werner can rely on me. I'm sure. All notified except for Rob. 10pm, basement. - Where's Werner? - He's out. - I need to see him. - I think so does he. 10pm, basement. - What's up? - Big business tonight. I'm not doing it. What's that? Orders from above, all hands on deck. How's the miss? Under her thumb already? Werner won't accept it today. It's family day. But without me. - I'll wait for Werner- - Good luck, he's out with Willi. Over there. Another one. Always pissing. I'd rather be in Mallorca. With piano and violin. - Yes, please? - Excuse me... I took the 13 from Bromberger Platz... - ... to the last stop. - Yes, and? - Well, you understand... When I exited, I had... I noticed my small brown bag was missing, you see? Why are you here then? 13 is going to Spandau. And in such cases lost & found is responsible, Potsdamer Straße. Lost & Found, Potsdamer Straße. - Thanks. - Sure. What nonsense, should've taken care of it at 13's exit. - I didn't know it. - You've been here long enough! [unintelligible discussing] - So? - It looks good. Okay. Will I have one too? No, not you. - Short-sighted, huh? - Yes. - Where'd you come from, Rudi?! - Just ran away, boys. Werner said there'd be magic, don't want be stuck at home. - So, everyone here? - Even Rudi, just arrived. Rudi? Is he crazy? - Rob's missing, he won't come. - What does that even mean? - He doesn't want to. - I see, he doesn't want to. He was very nice, we went to the political police and well.. They wanted to know why I came over and what I did for a living. And so on... It's not final yet, but I think I will get a temporary visa. That'd be great, no? If only it were faster. - Did he ask about me? - Yes, he sends his regards. If only all police were like that. How romantic in the cottage, nice. Unfortunately, no time. I need you, get dressed. I won't come. I don't want to. We need to talk, Werner. They're waiting for you 30 minutes in the basement. 2 minutes to get dressed, clear? Sorry to have disturbed, my lady. But there is business to do, see? Hurry, and leave your bike. You'll be riding with me. Rudi? Rudi? Rudi? And with the stolen car you'll drive... right here. - Corner Flurstraße... - ...Leimweg. Yes, you'll be in the car with me and Rob. Otto and you, professor, you'll be on your bikes. Meeting at 1.45am, here. Schedule says the last bus enters the depot at 1.55am. 10 minutes later the transport arrives for all the earnings. Leaves us 9 minutes to cash in and get out. Has to run like clockwork. 1.56am we're in the cashier's room. Otto... and you, Willi. You intimidate the cashiers with your pistols, all while... Rob, the professor and I load all the cash. 1, 2, 3... until the whole cashier's room is empty. Me? - Forgot me, huh? - You're the most important man. At 1.48am, at the stop Dornegg, you'll enter the last bus and go to the depot. If someone asks, you're a trainee. We'll get you a proper jacket too. You'll keep your eyes open until we come. If something seems weird, you'll split and we'll meet here. Here, please keep the bus fare ready! Tonight it's us cashing in. Questions? Wouldn't it be better to wait for the cash transport to exit? - Grab that one? - A cash transport? The one with bulletproof windows? Two armed guards, old soldiers? Otto, Otto! We won't risk that. Something else. No shooting except emergencies. Can't I come along too? No, Rudi. You're still on sick leave. - I'll wait for you then. - It could take 4 hours, kid. - I don't care. - What are we doing until then? - I'll grab some sleep. - Yeah... - Me too. I'll go to the cinema, maybe. - Red Roses. - That tearjerker! Yeah, try getting tickets! It's always sold out. - Coming too, Rob? - Rob's staying with me. Otherwise you'll get lovesick and we'll have another problem. Remind me to get fuel, will you? Good luck. - For whom? - Doesn't matter. Ellen... Ellen, where is Werner? - What's with her... - Ellen, please! Rob's with him. Jealous? - Good evening, gentlemen. - Good evening. - 30 litres. - Of course, 30 litres. - Where are you going? - Toilet, be right back. - Do you have a toilet? - Sure, it's over there. Thanks. Oil? Yes, of course. Yes. - Not much in there. - I've just had it changed! Fill up what's missing. 1.30am to 2am at the bus depot. Yes, a heist on the cashier's room. Can't speak anymore now. Watch out, they're armed. - Would you like a receipt? - Sure, I keep my books in order. Sure, a moment please. - 2 more hours to go. - Well... It's only trouble with my wife since taking on the late shift. "Paule, can't come home quietly?" That's what she always says. You come home quietly with those boots, she rants and- - Depot 3, night cashier, Berthold. - Criminal police. - Oh, really? - Is there still money? - Of course. - Get all the money out of there. That's something! - We're there in 30 minutes. - Of course, I understand. Criminal police, there's supposed to be a heist tonight. We have to lock the money! Police is here in 30 minutes! - Boy, you've got trouble. - For God's sake! Look at this damn mess! Gentlemen, exact time? - It's now... - Bell exactly at 1.49am, boing! There's the car! - What's up with you, nervous? - No, why do you ask? Not bad. I'm good. Bus is coming. What is it? Horrid weather. What's up with you? Need to fetch my bike. What line are you on? None, still training. Boy, you've chosen some job! It's a bit early. We still have 4 minutes. Last one... number 3. Attention, Berta 1 and Berta 7. Berta 1 blocks Gräußenweg. Berta 7 blocks Weidenheimer Straße. Watch check. 01:53am. Damn! Someone's coming! It's Fritz! Run, someone snitched! There's police everywhere! Damn. Quick, get in, all to the basement. But everyone on their own! Otto! Help! - Police! - Help, ow- Wasn't that someone calling for help? Berta 1, 7 and 12. Await further instructions. - Is Rudi here? - Not for two days. - Werner? - I don't know, I'm waiting too. - They had something planned. Must be something big. Nobody tells me anything. - Do you need anything? - No, I'm good, thank you. - Maybe a- - No, I must leave. A double cognac, please. So, tell us now. What blew your fuse there. There's explanations, no? Your wrecked nerves? Had a little breakdown there. I can even sympathize with that. You're a sensitive one. I know that. I can even picture someone like you... ... going to the police. No, I can't picture it. What number is that here? Fritz, come here. Call this number here. Let's see who picks up. Maybe you start talking? I've asked you a lot of questions. I don't get it. Werner wanted to call right after. Are you also scared? I'm always scared. Did you forget, how you came to us? Not even 30 pennies for the tram? Ripped sweatshirt, no dick in your pants... and now? Bank account, nice bike. A girl too. Criminal police. Thiel's the name. Yes, I've snitched on you. I've called the police. It was my only chance not to go to prison! And yours too! I don't want this anymore, see? I'm fed up with all this. I don't want it anymore! Also tell them about the basement? No. I even believe you. Not much time here, what shall we do with him? Pig! If we let him walk, we're done here. Guaranteed. He'll be singing at the police in 30 minutes. - Right? - Exactly! - And tomorrow we're in prison. So what shall we do? I knew what I'd do, but... Since it was one of you, you'll have to decide it. Vote. So... Otto? - He'll have to go. - How? - Shoot him, no other way. Thanks. Fritz? Snitch eats a bullet. - No need to discuss it. - Good, and you, Willi? Already said we can't let him walk. - But shooting him brings even more heat. - Rudi? - We can't just kill him, we must- - Good, it's fine, professor? So? One like that... kill him! Good. You do it. You decided, so you'll also shoot him. Don't be scared, he'll never shoot. Why look at me like that? Werner... you said... Shoot, you said. - He's still alive. - Yes, he's still breathing. Rudi, go get him. Otto, take my car, and hurry. It's already 2.30am. - Something must've happened. - Nonsense. Don't get nervous! He's wasted. He'll come to his senses. Why did I do that? - Why did I- - Shut up and get a grip! This idiot, this joker! How could I know he'd shoot? Didn't you want that? Me, why me? You took a vote, that's it. Why did I do that? It's too late. It's too late now. How did this happen? Werner? - I ask you, what happened? - You ask him! You think you're not part of this too? We must all distance ourselves! That's why we did it! One snitched, one had to kill him. But for the sole reason that it's not all of us in prison! - And what happens to me? - Each on their own from here. It's not as easy as that. What if the professor snitches? Then we have to kill him too? One after another, there's no ending there. I don't know you anymore. A human life... extinguished. I don't want to see you again. If you wish! Don't want to see you again... Good Lord, what have we done. - Now we all have to pay. - Such bullshit you're saying! Something happened. Yes, take a look. Stop with this nonsense! Do it yourself, I'll leave! Werner, you can't leave me here. You need to help me after this! Leave me, you four-eyed weasel! I don't understand you. What's the big problem now? What can happen if everyone shuts their mouth? They'll go easy on him, I'll get him a good lawyer. Say something here! You can thank him. Did you call us? - Yes, it's over there. - Let's go! Block the right basement exit! Special operations to- Gröger, Geschle-! Warn them, they're all armed! You head to the left wing! They're all armed! Berta 1 to 4, cover the exits!
