You qualify for my team. You will be taken to my castle for further training. The Mad One, still on the battlefield, treats us like his tin soldiers. Quiet. Ruell, cut it out. Stop. Stop immediately. I command you to stop. Chico, where are you? Come here. Stop it. You're on the same side. I think I'll put you in my pocket. Then you'll have more sense in your pocket than in your head. Alright. I will not have any trouble here. You will obey my orders. Chico, walk with me. Von Rudloff, I think you owe us an explanation. You've kept us long enough here. Steve, cool it. You're keeping us here in the desert, hundreds of miles from nowhere. Why? You have signed the contracts. You are being well treated, well housed, well fed. Do not ask questions. You can't buy people. The men are getting jittery. I think you should let us know what's going on. What you think is of minor importance. Steve, you're hurt. I'm sick and tired of sitting around here without anything happening. Meeting you has only made it worse. I can't help that I'm the only one to choose from. Look, the only reason I stuck it out for so long was because I want to marry you. At last. They feel like mercenaries, Herr General. Warn them not to try to leave the castle. The is the driest desert in the whole world. They will die of thirst. Steve Hunt, I want to know what he is thinking. That girl also, he's involved with her. Make friends with him. We cannot afford to lose him now, not now, Chico. Where? Tokyo. Your physique. Olga's very pretty. Why did she come here? Like me, for the money, but it was one hell of a mistake not checking out Von Rudloff first, but then I shouldn't insult your Herr General in front of you, should I? Don't try to escape. I'm warning you for her sake. I got the general. Yes, you and your general, strange combination. I was in the circus, a clown, of course, to have people laugh at me because of my size. One day, Von Rudloff come to my caravan. He offered me work here at the castle. I was glad to leave the circus. I'm happy here with the general. If you ask me, he's a nutcase. Yes, he is strange, but I think I understand him. He's kind to me in his way. I am his only friend. Yes, man's best friend, like a dog. Tell me what's going on. You must know. You should stick around to the action. That's my advice. There's going to be plenty of it. Please stay. No. I don't know, Herr General. Did you ask him? I asked him, but he didn't answer me. He can't go now that I have traced Miyagi. Does this mean your dream will come true after all these years? He is thin, miserable, and stinking rich, a collector of jewels, particularly diamonds, from among the most precious in the desert. My karate team had to compete against his karate team, Germany against Japan. This arena is built to the exact specifications of the one designed by for the event. Berlin, 1941. The Fuhrer was there himself. He sat there. Heil, heil, heil, heil, heil, heil, heil. Miyagi bribed some members of my team. He bribed them with diamonds. He always has diamonds, and Japan won. Miyagi betrayed me. He ruined my career and my name. I lost my rank as captain. I was dishonorably discharged. You have disgraced the German Reich. As an officer, there is only one thing left for you to do, and now I shall use diamonds to bring Miyagi here. I shall challenge him to a karate Olypiad, my team against his, battles to complete finality. Do I shock you? If it will help you to come to terms with yourself, Herr General, let's get going. Miyagi is on his way, arriving tomorrow at Windhoek, and from there by light aircraft. You see? It is not a dog that is man's best friends, but diamonds. Walk with me, Chico. Ladies and gentlemen, would you kindly fasten your safety belts and extinguish your cigarettes as we will be landing shortly at Windhoek? We hope you have enjoyed your flight and that you will be our guest again on South African Airways in the near future. Your attention, please, would Mr. Hido Miyagi please report to the information desk where he will be met for his private flight to Swakopmund? Thank you. Everyone outside. Move, move, move. , midget. The general called you outside. You been licking his whatchamacallit again? When I'm finished with you, you will have to crawl to lick mine. I'm so small, but so persistent. I have invited you to my castle to compete in an Olympiad, two international karate teams in combat, like there has never been before. For the victorious, there will be the most magnificent prize. My team will consist of 20 men, men who are not afraid and who do not lose. My team will win. Any questions? To cancel your contract, yes, you have a choice. The gates are open. You must bear the consequences of your own actions. What is this magnificent prize that you spoke of? Whatever you ask that I have. But General, they take everything. If the team wins, you understand? The team must win if you are to get the magnificent prize, so we must make the best team possible, the very best fighters out of every country in the world, right? Dan Howser, you are not up to scratch. You must go. Olga, you too must go. The rest may stay. I cancel my contract and accept the consequences. There will be transport provided for those who have so nobly resigned for the general good of the team, not for the others. Listen, we've got to get out of here. Oh no, you stay. You're not going to sacrifice yourself for me. Olga, listen. We go together. But there's no way... Just play for time. There's no way out of here. You know that. Steve, come back. You're getting what you want, even if Olga has to go. You said you're in for the money. Count Rudloff burns me up, Chico. Grab what you can while you can. Every dog has his day, and Von Rudloff's isn't far off. She goes tomorrow. You didn't read the small print, did you? Why didn't you go, and let Olga stay? Then we'd all be happy. Cool it. Cool it. Baron von Rudloff. Miyagi, nothing seems to age people from the East, not troubles, not wars, not time. Only today, now, is important. But my letter reached you in the past. To be answered by the present person. I could still get together the best karate team in the world. Then I would like you to bring here your 20 top fighters for, what do the Americans call it? A replay. I came here to buy diamonds. They have little to do with karate. May I hold it for a moment, please? And your price for this? It is yours. If you agree, if your team wins, this is yours also. You must confess to my family and to the world that it was your treachery that cost me my rank and my honor. Your honor is still with you. I accept your challenge and will do anything you say to get this. What do you call it? The Namib Star, the Karate Death, or perhaps even the Baron's Revenge? Fine, we leave together. We leave Von Rudloff. We leave the castle. We just catch the next bus that leaves here every half an hour. We might as well do a tour while we're about it. We'll take photographs of the natives and buy souvenirs. There's the terminal right over there by the second dune next to the ice cream stand. Olga, will you please shut up for a minute? And we'll sit under the palm trees, and we'll sip fruit punch, and we'll... Listen, instead of talking so much, why don't you help me find a solution? Just catch the next plane. Of course, we have to wait for the snow to stop falling. Olga, shut up. Sorry, love. It's just that we've got to get out of here, but who can help us? There's no one at that castle with guts enough to oppose Von Rudloff. Even Chico's scared of the general. Chico. Chico. This is the cue, the fight to the end, scorpion against centipede, wolf against bear, man against lion. Of course, I won't hurt you. You are my only friend, after all these years, still only you and I, not even Herr General. Do you remember it? Ladies and gentlemen, we introduce Chico and Chiquita. I'm so short. If another of our friends is taken away, I may short circuit. It's not a doll. Hey. Give it here. Hey, Chico, Chico, Chico. Chico, Chico, Chico, Chico. Watch out for your thingamajig. Chico. Don't worry. I'll fix it for you. If you need any help, just call on me. We need it now, Chico. We want to get out of here. A car will arrive tonight when everybody's asleep. I see you have made friends with Steve. He won't fight for us. He will do as I say. Will Miyagi do as you say? Of course not. Steve has an unorthodox technique. Including him, we have now seven men. Our team must be 20. You will leave tomorrow, and you will bring back the 13 best karate fighters in the world. Lovely desert night tonight, don't you think? We are disgraced. For you, there is only one way. They shot him. ♪ I am a man ♪ ♪ I do what I can ♪ ♪ To fuel your love, girl ♪ ♪ To make you happy ♪ ♪ I tell you why ♪ ♪ To help me fly ♪ ♪ Over the clouds and away ♪ ♪ Well, if you are a woman ♪ ♪ And I love you ♪ Yay. ♪ Come with me ♪ ♪ Then you'll see ♪ ♪ Our lives will start from today ♪ ♪ Love isn't easy ♪ ♪ But I'll explain ♪ ♪ I am the one man ♪ ♪ To ease the pain ♪ ♪ I'm a man ♪ ♪ I do what I can ♪ ♪ To give you love, girl ♪ This stuff just makes me thirsty.

From everywhere in the world, you will bring here a team that cannot lose. Good luck. And if Steve Hunt joins Miyagi's team? Pay me enough, and there'll be no problem. I'll get him where it hurts. This beats fighting. Oh, come on. Karate's your first love. If you're that easily hurt, you won't be able to do exercises for a few days. It depends what sort of exercise. My new karate teacher. Ah, so karate's your first love. Lorraine, Steve. Hi. Push off now. This is a private lesson. I just left. I'll change. Okay. Lorraine, come. I am sorry to keep you here, Fraulein. I want Steve. You will write him a letter telling him to return. If he rejoins my team, I will forget everything that has happened in the past. You never forget anything. You will write a letter. I must have Steve in my team. I am collecting together the best 20 karate fighters in the world. Small is the man who has no etiquette. Von Rudloff. We are collecting the best team in the world. Pay a lot of money. Big money makes man small. You are known as one of the greatest fighters in the world. Big words impress small men. The real truth lies only in the test. We're collecting the best karate people in the world, and we've got a lot of money to pay. What can you do? 5,000 each, also expenses, sign here. We've already joined Miyagi. Against one of the best. Then I'll sign. If you go to the police, Von Rudloff will kill her, but if you join my team, you will get back into the castle. That way you stand a chance of helping her. I was just testing you. Small man with big mouth puts foot in it. I'm looking for Wan Tai Hong. They say he's the fastest man alive. Is he as fast as they say? 5,000 and all expenses. No contract. 10,000. No contract. 20,000. No contract. You joined Miyagi. I'm looking for the Sage. You've ruined my shot. Have any of you people here seen the Sage? You're cheating. Pleased to meet you, Sage. We are offering you 5,000... 5,000 and expenses. Yeah. Hey, you punk, you ruined my shot. I've already joined Miyagi. Welcome, Herr Chico. Woohoo. Stop that man. Hold him. Get him. Hey, stop. I'll pay you 5,000. Stop. Hey. If you join our team. Miyagi's offered me double that. Wait a minute. I'll double up on Miyagi. I'll pay you anything. 100,000. Miyagi will double anything you offer. Ah, the small man grows bigger through much testing. Small man says big man pass test. Welcome to my castle and to my team. I expect you to attain peak condition. There will be no relaxing until we have won. We start training at once. Follow me. Hold it. General says I must deliver this. Take one. Thank you. Open up, man. Olga. Chico, Chico. You know the general well enough to work that one out for yourself. I'll help you. Thank you. Go. When your enemy becomes aggressive, you become passive, a rock. Remember, karate is not an art exclusive to the East. The sounds you make are animal sounds, the roar of a lion, the chirp of a cricket. The animals of the desert are hard and quick. Be like them. Let your hand be drawn to your form, like a magnet. Concentrate. Let the sand of the desert into your blood. Karate, empty hands. Let your opponent fear you by being without fear yourself. Empty your minds. Let the energy of the mind generate through the fist. Wear down your opponents. Undermine his confidence. Chico. Steve, she's okay, but you should come back before things get very difficult. All Herr General needs is just to restore his honor, nothing more. I am doing what I can. I'm coming back, Chico, but my way. In all your life, you've only been a fighter, and you have never lost the fight. Welcome. This is my whole team. Ah, yes, I recognize all of them. Champion 1973. 1972. Follow me to my castle. One of my team. Don't mix the teams. Wait until the arena tomorrow. Beats sitting with them. By the way, Olga looks really good. Her nails are just too sharp. I honor your white team. And I honor your black team. It is a pity the world will not witness this gauntlet. Far better because our duels to the death are illegal, as you know. Soon the world will have to admit it is violent, and then you may challenge me publicly. I will beat you again. You still believe you beat me in Berlin. No, I did, Miyagi. Soon you will have to admit it. To an honorable Olympiad tomorrow. Come on, come on. Follow me at a distance. Now listen to me, and don't ask any questions. You've got to be awake at sunrise. Chico's gonna be arriving with the keys. Olga, Chico's agreed to help us escape. Olga, will you please listen to me? I have to get back to the party. I haven't got much time. I am going to eliminate you. Yes, Luke will kill you tomorrow morning in the arena. You always say, "Walk with me." You have joined Miyagi's team against my orders. You will see that your team does not win. You will lose all your battles tomorrow. First you try to buy me. Now you dictate to me. If you refuse, I will give her to Ruell. We have to change our plans. He suspects something. We can't change them. Alright, man, don't take it out on me. Son of a, he's got no feeling. Take it easy, Steve. We've still got time. He leaves me no choice. Whoever gets 20 points first, the Olympiad is his. I cannot allow fighting like this. Luke is a little difficult to control. I think is the old man is cracking up. Any bets we won't get out of here alive? I think I have not made myself clear enough. You have. Ruell, you go to her and take her. Now you will fight Luke. Get away from the door. Bring a stretcher. Fight is over. Let him suffer some more. I am beginning to doubt your loyalty. You betrayed me today. Why? You, the only one who understands me, you know how important it is for me to win. Herr General, there is sometimes victory in defeat. Who is this monkey you have brought here? One monkey is better than two baboons. You are relying heavily on Steve. And will continue to do so. We've got a plan. The last fight. My contestant is Steve, and yours? This was Chico's brilliant idea. He's getting his revenge on both of us. I can't fight you. This final bout, this final competition, will be a fight to the death. Guards. Steve Hunt, you have 30 seconds to start fighting. She has a knife. He may have one too if you wish. Steve will never kill his girl. And so, I will win. 15 seconds. Do it. Throw me. Order your guards to throw their weapons into the arena. No seconds left. Guards. Drop your weapons. Put them in the cells. Lock up the whole of his team. You can't do that, Von Rudloff. Lock them all up, all of them, both teams. Von Rudloff, you haven't changed. I will never lose, never lose. I shall have them all in front of a firing squad. But General, it's not the way to... Quiet, I have had enough of victory through defeat. The general sent me. Open up. Come on, fast. I think there's trouble in the cells. You better go and watch them. Chico.
