What I'm saying is that it's more than what it seems, that's all. Much more. People don't know because they're too busy with their game shows and football and silliness to take the time to look and read and figure it all out. Who is it that said, "Believe none of what you hear and half of what you see"? These are interesting times we're living in. That's another saying. Chinese. Actually, it's a curse. All you have to do is look and learn to connect the dots and get ready. Did you know there's only three days' worth of food in the stores and when the S-H-T-F, the 99 % are gonna be out of commission. I'm only telling you this because I wouldn't be a good father to you if I didn't let you know all the stuff that I know. It bears repeating, so I'm repeating it, so you can be prepared. It's only a matter of time and it's not far off now. All you have to do is look around. You can see it if you open your eyes. The biggest problem we have isn't anything that a little focus couldn't cure. And it's not like it's so hard. There's tons of information out there if people just take the time to look. And if you think being busy with all that stuff you think is so important, well, you're gonna learn that that's not what really matters, I mean what really matters. All that's gonna matter is what you do now. And I'm not saying all this to scare you or because I'm scared, because I'm not scared, if that's what you think, no, I'm ready. I just want to be ready. Nice talking with you, Dad. Yeah, okay. Bye. Maggie, huh? You're new here. And $22.56. It's always a good idea to know your neighbor. You never know when you might need 'em. Can I see your driver's license? Ed Hemsler. ...unemployed workers and returning veterans were amongst the most hotly-debated items in the report. The governor, after taking time off from his vacation to thoroughly examine the proposed budget cuts, has asked for a three-day period to allow his staff to assess the merits of the proposal and respond to what one official has termed "petty obstructionism." Fortunately, Ed Hemsler has devised an innovative solution to our problems, allowing him the much-envied ability to sit around in his underwear as the world passes him by. Hi. Hi. - That'll be $9.50. - Okay. Thank you. Wrong. Wrong. ...federal mandates affecting National Guard members. Governor Wilkenson said that he welcomed the changes citing recent events as families gathered to honor the 17 people who died that terrible day. The governor added that he believed there was a growing hope and sense of purpose shared amongst Americans as we seek to find new ways to prevent tragedies like this from ever happening again. What's the matter, Ed? Did I say something wrong? Thank you. Hi, Ed. Maggie. The forecast, mostly sunny skies today... Oh, I'm sorry! That's my fault. I got ya. Okay. Phew. Nice car. It's not a Ford. You like it? Yeah. It's good... on gas. Oh, that's important. You never know when you're gonna need some. - Yeah. - You like coming here? Dan's, I mean. I see you here from time to time. It's-- it's convenient. Nice selection. So, have a nice day... I'm Ed. Ronnie. Ronnie? Ronnie. That's a man's name. Ronnie what? Meisner. - M-E-- - E-I. Ah... Hemsler. That's my last name. Ed Hemsler. Pleased to meet you. Ooh. Okay. Nice to meet you. Yeah. You too. Have-- have a good day. Ronnie Meisner. So? What're you shopping for today? Oh. Hi. Just some stuff. And how about you? Yeah, I'm just getting some stuff too. Well, it's good to see you again, Ronnie. All right. You have a good day. Ed. Ed. Wow, you were busy. What're you getting ready for? Oh, no. I just needed some things. You're ready, aren't you? I get it. I can see it. You can see? I knew it the minute I saw you. You know, the way you were looking. Smart shopping, strategic. I get it. Well, I was just getting some things. Yeah, I know. And I know you know. This is all going down. You like coffee? You gotta realize there's more to it than that. There's things that most people don't understand. America. This is such a special place. Special in history. You gotta look at the whole picture. You ever hear of The Federalist Papers? Uh-uh. To know what they are, you gotta go way back to what's called the Magna Carta. That's when things really got going, but you can go back further than that if you want. See, it's all a matter of controlling people. You got basically two types: those who want to control you and those who don't want to be controlled. That's me, the second type. You want more coffee? Oh, no. No. I... Ooh. Ooh, I got to get back. Yeah, I gotta get back to some stuff, too. You need to borrow my watch next time? Sorry. You like pie? I like pie. Just 'cause they have some great pies at Guy's Grill. I was thinking maybe we could go to dinner and then finish up with a couple of slices. Apple, peach. Around 8:00? 8:00 sounds good. Oh. Good. They have karaoke. Not that there's anything special about it. The way I see it, we're pretty much all the same. I'm your basic, average red-blooded American male. I got a son, Brian. He's got a nice family. Great daughter. Pretty wife. They got a big house about an hour or so from here. I had him around the time I started with Capital Bearings. I did systems analysis. Basically quality control. You have no idea how screwed up the world would be if it weren't for ball bearings. And they have to be perfect, and I mean perfect, or else, boom! About six years ago, I took the severance. It was a... pretty decent deal. I'm not the type to complain. The way I see it, I'm on the wrong side of 60 anyway, I'm not getting any younger, but I'm... I'm talking too much. How about you? You have kids? Um... my daughter died. She was my world. But... It wasn't fair. But you know what they say about life. Yeah. I like to sew, though. Um, I, uh... I got some stuff I like to do. Oh, that's... I'm sorry. Yeah. It was... She was special. She was going to be 13. How'd she die? Well... It was a really rare disease. MENS. "Men"? M-E-N-S. It's Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Syndrome. I read so much. The doctors said, nothing they could do. But I don't know, I... - Your husband? - He died, too. But not from a rare disease. Just cancer. I told him not to smoke, but what can you do? What can any of us do? You know what you said before about being on the wrong side of 60? To me, I don't think there's a wrong side of 60. You know, I don't mind telling you... I think you got a real nose for this game. The way people look at things. It's all in the eyes. What kind of tuna do you prefer? Generally speaking. Oh... I guess Charlie. StarKist. Me too. Paper products? Paper products? Yeah, you know, toilet paper. It's important. Oh. Well, I don't really think about it. I just squeeze 'em. Right. It's all about not making things harder than they have to be. - Batteries? - I know this one. Coppertop. Generic on that one as far as I'm concerned, as long as it's alkaline. That's key. You seem to know a lot about stuff. Well, I do. Because I care. I can see that. Oh, that old thing, it's only good for news and weather. That's the only thing worth listening to as far as I'm concerned. Everything else is just... ...people trying to get you to buy something you don't need. ♪ Doin' the town And doin' it right In the evenin' ♪ ♪ It's pretty pleasin' ♪ ♪ Muskrat Suzie, Muskrat Sam ♪ ♪ Do the jitterbug At a Muskrat Land ♪ ♪ And they shimmy ♪ ♪ Sam is so skinny... ♪ What is it? What-- what's wrong? Ed! What is it? You can't do this! Well, I know. I'm not a great singer. No, no! That's not... You don't like "Muskrat Love"? I love "Muskrat Love"! Oh, I'm sorry. No, no, no. No, no. Don't say you're sorry. It's not you. You're... You're wonderful! Well, what is it? Ed! Ed! Ed! I like you! What? I like you, too! No! I mean I really like you! And it scares the hell out of me. I had a really great time. Oh. I got these for you. They're beautiful. Well, good night. Can we go to your place? Oh, can I... Oh. Yes. Oh. Put these in water until I go. Oh, sure. Uh... Let me get you something to drink. I have everything. Oh. Just water. Are you sure? I got everything. Wine, beer, mixed drinks. No, just water, please. Got that, too. Purified and fluoride free. Your house is-- is lovely. Everything is so well... kept. It's my home. Oh. Here, why don't you sit down. Uh, do you want to watch TV? Oh, okay. Ah, here. Let's see. So, what do you like to see? Sports? No? No, I'm kidding. Movies? I like movies. Old ones. Back when they knew what they were doing. Yeah, things were different then and I don't mind saying it was better as far as I'm concerned. I mean, I like being progressive and all that sort of thing, but there comes a point when you just gotta say, John Wayne is where I want to be, you know what I mean? Uh, I think so. So, what kind of movies do you like? Documentaries. Mm. On what? What kind of subject? War. Oh. As 150,000 soldiers stormed across the English Channel... I wouldn't have pegged you as a war type. War is so interesting. My dad was in the war. The big one. Do you know where? Well... He said he saw the world. He said it was great. Well, yeah. I was... Well, I never got to go. Oh, no? That's a good thing, isn't it? Oh, I don't know. A man can learn a lot about himself in war. Yeah. My dad just mostly learned how to drink. Then there's that, too. You like to drink, Ed? Sometimes. Well, not a lot. I like to keep a clear head. You never know when you're gonna need your wits. Oh. Can we just sit here, please? I mean I know that... I-- I just like being here. Just sitting, watching TV. No, no. We can sit and watch TV. That would be great. Good morning. Two Equals, right? Oh. Oh! What... Was it just one? The time... Oh! Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no. What is it? Oh, no, no, no. I'm late. I'm late for work. So, you're a little late for work. No! No! No, no... Oh, my God. You didn't go home last night. Ronnie Meisner, I do believe you are doing the walk of shame. No. No, no, no, no. Really? That? Oh, I have a ride. You sure? Don't worry about me. You're not out of the way or anything. Oh, it's... I'm fine. A hundred percent, yeah? Yeah, I'm fine. Thank you, but, really, I'm good. Oh, man. I only hope I can do it like you do when I'm your age. Oh, it's not what it seems. Whatever. Just don't do anything I wouldn't do twice. ...the third major power outage this year due to high winds. The LLPC has begun upgrades to the system that are intended to prevent future power outages. Needless to say, Ed Hemsler has a backup generator for just such occasions... because Ed Hemsler thinks of everything. Because Ed Hemsler thinks of everything. Because Ed Hemsler thinks of everything. You like Chinese? What... We don't have to do Chinese. Ed Hemsler, a woman doesn't like to be left in the dark. When a gentleman takes her out, the least he could do is contact her in some way and let her know that he had fond memories of their evening together even if he didn't, because that's what gentlemen do. But I am a gentleman. Well, then where were you? Why didn't you call me? I thought you might want a break or something. A break from what? Well, from me. I kissed you. You did. Chinese is fine. I'll be right out front. You can find out the truth if you know where to look for it. The Internet is the biggest library in the universe. Someone called it the deep water of logic and limitation. And I like to swim. Ask me something. Something? Like what? Something like anything. Well, I don't know. Like what? Isn't there something you want to know that you don't know? Not really. - Nothing? - No. So, you know everything there is you want to know. No, I didn't say that. So, what do you want to know? I think what I mean is I don't know what I want to know yet. About you. And when I know what I want to know, I'll let you know. Is that okay? Yeah. Good noodles. One day, you must remember to explain to me what this has to do with the real world. What this has to do with the real world? What-- Jesus, Brian. No, I'm not hogging the conversation. You want to speak? Go ahead, speak. I actually don't want to talk about any of this anymore. It's not like I have a bank account that is magically filled every other week. I have work that I have to do. Are you saying I didn't earn it? I'm not saying anything. $23.50. Well, I did earn it. Seventeen years of earning it doing real work. Work that mattered, back when people honored their commitments. But now, all I can say is good luck when it's time to collect. We don't accept checks anymore. Now, I know you think I'm saying all this stuff just to make you think that I'm smarter than you so that I can act like I'm still your father. Well, I got news for you, I am still your father. I know you're still my father. That's why I called. Janet and I want to invite you to Thanksgiving dinner this year. Will your mother be there? Of course not. Will you come? Can I bring someone? Tina? Hey, I'll call you back, okay? Yeah. I see him. The way he waits outside for you. He's, like, so totally your BFF. What is that? A BFF? Best friend forever. He waits for me? Look, my guy, the guy I'm into right now, he's like that. He thinks about me. He holds doors. Oh, Ed does that. - Ed? - Mm-hmm. Ed's a good name. I mean, it's not very original, but that might not be such a bad thing. - You want my opinion? - Yeah. I say, ride it like a wave. What's that mean? "Ride it--" Don't fall off the board and it's all good. When I'm you're age, if don't mess it up, I'm going to have an Ed and I'm going to dig it because it's all there is. Just Ed or Chris... Bobby, Peter... He's invited me to Thanksgiving at his son's house. Whoa. Turkey is a serious thing. It's a commitment. You can tell a lot about a person by how they cook a turkey. I don't think Ed's gonna be making the turkey. I've got you. Sure? Almost there. Keep them closed. Okay, I am. Showing you this means I'm trusting you more than anybody. What is it? No, keep 'em closed. They're closed. Even my son has never seen this. For goodness' sake, what is it? Open them now. Okay. You can't see it, can you? What can't I see? Oh. Oh. You have to promise me that you will never tell anyone what you've seen here today. I do, I... I promise. Because if people find out, when the S-H-T-F, they will tear this place apart. Not that I want to be cruel or anything, but they've had plenty of warning. This is the power supply over here. I got these special mufflers I designed myself. The exhaust is channeled around to the other side of the house to a hidden chute. Well, you really are ready for anything. The way I see it, you never know when things are gonna go south. The world, the flesh and the devil conspire, and things fall apart. This is my security blanket... my safety net... my 401k. You remember when you asked me if there was anything that I wanted to know that I didn't know? Yeah. How-- how did you do this? What-- what do you mean? It's perfect. Wrong. Ooh. Don't... No, I can't. Ooh! Whoa! Whoo! Oh. Here, let me help you with that. Oh, no, I can handle it. Come on, let me be the gentleman. You are the perfect gentleman. Why... Why don't you let me-- Please? The perfect gentleman. Perfect. I keep this place to work on basic skill sets. You got nothing to be afraid of. I said I'm not afraid. Okay. And let your eye go right down the barrel to sight what you want to hit. Couldn't you thought of something more sinister? - Oh, it's a bear. - It's a teddy bear. You're-- Ooh! - Whoa! - I did it! I did. What are you laughing about? This. Us. Here. It's so peaceful. Mm-hmm. It's nice. I laugh because soon, it's all gonna be over. What do you mean? I mean moments like this. They're going to be few and far between. Most of the time we'll be scrambling to survive. Ed, I don't understand. What-- Survive what? Oh, you have to know what I'm talking about. Deep down, you can feel it even if you don't admit it to yourself. It might start with a news bulletin. You're watching a commercial or something, and suddenly, this guy comes on. One of those plastic talking robots telling us the stock market is gonna crash. Then the president comes on. And the people are all waiting for him to speak. And when he does, he says there's a national emergency and he has to declare martial law. So, you can't believe it. So, you go to the local store and you see everyone in the street with a strange look in their eyes because they can't believe it too. So, you get to the store and it's filled with people buying everything they can get their hands on. And up in the sky, helicopters start going whoop, whoop, overhead and you know... you know. The first day, you watch TV trying to find out what's going on, but by the third day, it's nothing but static. And the net's down, too, just like your cell phone. Around about this time, you hear the first gunshot. And at first, it sounds strange and novel. But then, it's everywhere. It starts getting closer. And then, you see a body in the street. Nobody has come to move it. And then, another and another. So you decide to leave, only you're not alone. The streets are choked with cars. And then, the military comes. Only it's not our military, it's some other country's, and you can't believe it. But you know it's true. You know. You know. It's all over. You really think that's gonna happen? Ah. Maybe. I don't know. You're a really special lady, Ronnie Meisner. Ed? Are you okay? Aces. Dad. Welcome. Hey. This is, uh... my girlfriend, Ronnie. And a Happy Thanksgiving. Thank you so much. Uh, Ronnie, I'm Brian. It's great to meet you. Ed. Janet. Hi. I'm so glad you could make it. Oh, honey, this is Ronnie, Dad's girlfriend. - Look at you. Adorable. - Hey. - There's my girl. - Hi, Grandpa. So, how's things going? Come in. Come in. I wouldn't want to be part of that. Yeah, you don't want that. Jeanine. I'm Jeanine. Nice to meet you. Ronnie. How long has it been with you two? Oh, not long. So, but... But it's good? Yeah. You two, you both seem so young, so vital. You know you can turn it up if you want. Oh, no. It's really not a problem. I just like to look at the score. Oh. You can turn it up. It's really better with the sound down. I know what you're thinking. I'm not thinking anything. Not thinking. You ever talk about traveling together? Now's the time. Brian and I, we've been plotting our trip to Spain. Oh. Spain sounds nice. It's hard, you know. Make the time to travel. To... get on track. How are you and Ed with that? Are you... You guys on track? Uh... Yeah, great. We're on track. Don't be so sensitive. I get it. The angry old man thing. I'm not angry. I care. I care, too. About my family. Oh, you got a funny way of showing it, keeping your head in the sand. Okay. I'll bite. Show me. Brian, you-- No, really. Show me something worth seeing. All right. And so it begins. Where are they going? More wine? No, thanks. - Did you even read it? - Of course I read it. You stood here pacing back and forth while I read the thing. What's in your bug-out bag? What is a bug-out bag? The bag that's waiting for you when the S-H-T-F. The what? When the shit hits the fan! Why do you always act like this? Like what? Like you're in on some secret that nobody else knows about. I'm not the only one. There are lots of people that know what's going on. That's right, you're all sitting around in your underwear with your computers... I do not sit around in my underwear! Okay, whatever the fuck you're wearing, you're all telling me that the government is doing this, and corporations are doing the other thing. But you know what I see are just people trying to survive. Exactly, survive! Look, all I'm saying is... Wait... Let me show you. Why don't you just admit it? You're scared. You're scared to face the fact that you're never gonna figure it all out, and so what? That's just the world, that's what it is. - Dinner. - It's fucked up! It is crazy. It's stupid. But it's just the world. Dinner. And you know what? We are all gonna die one day. Even you. Dinner! Go to the far outside. - And slice it... - Shape, slice... Go work my way there. Yes, you work your way. Please help yourselves. Don't let it get cold. - You'll have that? - Yes. Thanks, Brian. - This looks very, very... - And sweet potatoes? Oh, we're not doing sweet potatoes this year. No sweet potatoes? Mm-mmm. It must really be the end of the world. You should try this. It's basmati rice. It's from India. I know what basmati rice is, Mom. Next, you're gonna tell me to finish it all because of starving children in India or something. Which reminds me, why exactly are we eating their rice? It's not theirs, it's yours now. So, yes, you should finish it. - It's exotic. - It's a little festive this year, dinner. It's innovative, right? I don't know if I'm starving, or if it's actually good... You know, I was just talking to Ronnie here about her and Ed maybe taking a little trip. Hmm? Maybe going someplace exotic? I'm sure if they want to take a trip, they'll take a trip. I'd like to see China. China? You know what they're doing over there? I like the food. There's more to the world than Chinese restaurants. Here we go. Like what, Grandpa? Well, the thing about China-- I think your grandpa would like to have his dinner in peace. - No, no. I-- - I know what you're doing, young lady. I'm not doing anything. Oh, that's right. You're so clever. You're smarter than all of us. - Oh, my fucking God. - Jeanine! Like I'm saying anything you haven't said a million times. I can assure you, I do not use-- Why do you always have to pretend to be something you're not? It's like I'm living in The Twilight Zone. Oh, please. You don't even know what The Twilight Zone is. It's a stupid TV show in black-and-white, so, yes, I know what The Twilight Zone is, Brian. All right, that's enough. What? Are you gonna send me to my room, Brian? - As a matter of fact, yeah. - Hey. Hey. What kind of daughter calls her father by his first name? One who has no respect. That kind. For what? For what? For what? How about the roof over your head. Or how about the orthodontist? Or how about the phone? Or how about all the schoolbooks that I buy you you never even have time to read? Why should I? The world's gonna end any day now anyway. That is just great. You see, you have her talking this crap now! - You see what you've done? - Jeanine's got a mind of her own. Yeah, I just decide to use it. To stockpile nonsense? You know what? How about we all calm down and maybe we talk about something that we can all agree on. Hmm? Me and Brian agree on something. We both think our fathers are assholes! All right, that's it. Zero 'tronics for you. That means one month, no TV, no phone. - No phone? - Yeah. Ask your grandpa about that. How're y'all gonna deal with that when the Internet goes down, the electrical grid collapses, and then, you have to communicate with what? You guys are gonna have to use smoke signals-- - Mom! - Maybe if you had a little bit more self control. I hope the world does end and takes you with it! Come back here, young lady! Come back here! - Hey! - More wine? Yeah, please. Okay. Not again. Where is she going? Nowhere. You think I'm an asshole? Good night, Ronnie. Don't you want to come in? Oh, hell. Jesus. Oh... Would you like a drink? I thought you were a fellow traveler. I am a fellow traveler! No! I mean a prepper. The way you shopped, the stuff you bought. You used cash! Not that I go in for that level of paranoia personally, but, hey, you can see how I could have come to that conclusion. Cash is easier. You don't have to remember numbers. You might try checks. Everybody doesn't take checks. Everybody takes cash. When my daughter died, it started up in her room, and it just... came down here. But... I don't understand how you could-- Please. Oh... Oh. Oh, don't worry about it! Do you want your toast buttered or you wanna do it yourself? Oh, no, you can butter it. Oh, just leave it. I don't want you to hurt yourself. Ed? Mrs. Meisner? How is he? Your husband's-- No, he's my boyfriend. Your boyfriend has had what we call a TIA. It's like a mini stroke, but temporary. It seems he's been rationing his medications, missing the target on his recommended dosages. He's gonna be a bit wobbly for a time, but he seems like a tough man. Can I see him now? Certainly, but take it easy on him. Oh. You poor dear. No. No, no, no, no. Don't. Don't try to speak. Shh. I'm not a poor dear. No. No. You're strong. The doctor told me you weren't taking your medication. Yeah, it's the money, isn't it? I know how expensive it gets. I know. But you? It make no sense. You spend all your money on that... on that stuff. For something that may not even happen. No, you? You only think about tomorrow when I'm here. I'm here right now. And all I think about is you. I came as fast as I could... Dad... You know, you're the smartest man I know. No, I'm not. I'm an asshole. But I'm getting better. The truck runs good. Well, it's a Ford. Thanks for picking it up. Ronnie seems like a really great lady. Yeah. Pretty great. Well-- You got a minute? Follow me. What do you see? Nothing. Exactly. See it now? So, this is where all your money goes. So? What do you think? Honestly... I'm not sure. Well, you can tell me. Crazy, right? Look, Dad, I don't-- Well, sometimes, crazy times call for crazy people. You know, Dad... I don't think you're crazy. Okay, maybe a little. But I think you have to do what makes you happy. I meant... I think, that's all any of us can do. I mean, if this is what makes you happy, and you're not hurting anyone, I say, hey, what the hell, go for it. And that's what you think? That's what I think. Hey, Dad? Are you okay? Holy shit. I am happy.

A sign? From God? Well, I don't know. It said, "yard sale." "Yard sale"? Not to get metaphysical or anything, but I had an inspiration. And it does feel kind of... divine. Divine? Well. I was thinking... maybe if we had a yard sale. My stuff and yours. We could make a weekend of it. I did some research. People can make a lot of money. But even if we don't, I have a feeling. What happened when you were in the hospital? What happened? Did you see the light? The light? You know. The light. I don't-- I don't think so. I just have a feeling. I don't mean to upset you. I'm not upset. Well, you sound upset. I'm not upset. It's just I-- I had a feeling, too. Maybe it's not divine like you, but... I have a feeling, too. Oh, not him. Oh, I love her. ...and then, they were off to Florence. She always looks so classy. There were TVs on the train, there were diplomats, there were Americans, there were Parisians, there were Syrian refugees. Everyone traveled together on the way to Florence. Why? That's interesting. I thought you always say we should keep up on current events. Current events? You want current events? Well, you're not gonna find it there. That woman is a liar. A lying, dishonest, disloyal, opportunistic liar... Huh. ...that one day will realize what she did. And then, she'll regret it, I can promise you that. Why do you say that? You don't even know her. Oh, I know her, all right. She's my ex-wife. Your wife? My ex-wife. She left a long time ago. Nineteen years. What, she's-- she's Brian's mother? Yeah. He's a genuine son of a bitch. Ed. Don't talk like that. Funny. I still watch her every day. She'll always mean something to you. It's okay. Sunday. It's the best day for a yard sale. I looked it up. This Sunday? Yeah. It's as good as any Sunday. But what about... It's time. You know... we can start organizing your stuff on Tuesday. If it's okay with you. What do you do if your boyfriend who you really, really care about wants you to do something... that you just feel uncomfortable about? I'd have to say it depends. How bad is it? Well... Well, now I really want to know what it is. Forget it. Never let a man make you do something you don't want to do. - Why don't you answer my calls? - I'm working. I know you're working. I can see you're working. Why don't you answer my calls? Please, not here. Yes, here. You won't come to me, I have to come to you. You don't understand. Then explain it to me. No, I can't explain it to you. Even if I could, you wouldn't understand. I don't understand. You said you would do it with me. I didn't say I would do it with you. - You did! - Keep you voice down. Why is it so important to you what I do? Because it's what we talked about. It's for us. No, it's for you. I'm fine where I am. I'm good where I am. No, you're not. Don't you presume to tell me about me, Ed Hemsler. I am a grown woman, and I don't have to listen to you. I didn't say you had to listen to me. Just get out. Now, just a minute. - Get out! - Is there a problem? Well, there's no problem. Ed was just leaving. I thought this was for real. She asked how you were doing, so I said, "You remember when you broke up with Sam?" Sam? It was her boyfriend for, like, two weeks in eighth grade. But anyway, we're there talking, and it was probably the first time that I really opened up about what it was like when you and Mom were splitting. All the door-slamming. Like, that was your last word, but it never was, and I was just sitting there like a... And then one day, the doors stopped slamming, and she was gone. Hey, Dad? I'm here. Look, all I'm saying is that sometimes it can feel like you're losing everything, but really, you're not losing, you're gaining. Or at least, that's what you taught me. I taught you that? Well, not in so many words. But yeah. So, what else did I teach you? How you doing today? Excuse me? How much is this? That depends. How much is it worth to you? Oh... Not as much as I thought. Well, maybe somebody else might need it more than you. Yeah, maybe. You never know when you might need a pretty jar. You're my BFF. My granddaughter told me what that means. Best friend forever.
