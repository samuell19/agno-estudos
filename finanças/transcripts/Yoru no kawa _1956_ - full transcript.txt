Daiei Films River of the Night (Yoru no Kawa) A Masaichi Nagata Production Script by Sumie Tanaka from the novel by Hisao Sawano Cinematography by Kazuo Miyagawa Music by Sei Ikeno Art Design by Akira Naito Traditional Japanese Music by Kazuo Nakamoto Assistant director: Tokuzo Tanaka Starring Ken Uehara and Fujiko Yamamoto Michiko Ono, Kazuko Ichikawa, Michiko Ai, Keizo Kawasaki Directed by Kozaburo Yoshimura Haruka, look. Ridiculous. What you say makes no sense! Don't be cheeky. I've been running this for more than 50 years, since we set up independently of the Honke (main branch of the family) When I started my apprenticeship... We didn't talk back to the master. That's so... feudal! So out of date! How dare you! Dad, Miyoko is ready. Toshio says he won't work outside set hours. If we worked according to the new labour law we'd go bust! But the labour laws are fixed in the constitution! Fool! The constitution can be rewritten! Toshio, just get on with it. OK. Yes, Madam. I'm going to work in a friend's electrical factory! This job is old fashioned. It has no future. When your father brought you here and asked me to take you on, do you know what he said? You'll make yourself ill again if you get worked up like that. There's a customer. And the Mistress of the main house (Honke) too! OK Thanks! Toshio, while you work here you must put the hours in. Mitsu, can you ask the Mistress of the main house about the arranged marriage. And ask her to find us another trainee! You may say so but... This sample I have here has a different weave from what you've brought. The colours will show differently when the light catches them. I paid 7,500 for this material. This is 10,000 even at wholesale price. Rather than a question of price it's one of quality. Really? Yes. Will you... I'll be there straight away. I will pay but please deduct the payment for the driver! One should never pay anything more than necessary! Wait a moment. It's just a little something but please accept some cake. Thank you. Goodbye. Goodbye. She's really scary! She really haggles for even the smallest thing! What? Coming directly to the dyer, cutting out the shop and the wholesaler... She's so pushy... she's hard work! These days people think the cheaper the better. There have been three shops in our local association forced out of business this year. Well, yes... You're the one I hope will inherit our Honke. Your taxi is here. Just a moment. Miyo, Seikichi! The car's here. KIwa, what did you think of that prospective groom? The family would like to settle it before your sister's marriage. Understood. This is Maruyoshi. Mr Okamoto? About helping with the exhibition? I'll come as soon as I can but I have to go to Kyoto station first. Yep, yep. Hurry up! My sister's waiting! Keep still then, so I can do it! Seikichi, your bride's no early riser. When you get her to Tokyo make sure you train her! Will do! That necktie is no good. It belongs to the shop! Surely we can have just one... I'll even buy it. If you give me a discount! Not this one. I won't be able to fill Sakuraya's order without it. Take anything else you like. What's all that about? - Meanie! This will look good on you. Lots of people are there! The weather's cleared up! There are loads of people outside waiting! The neighbours and in-laws are such a pain! You're about to be liberated from all that Kyoto fussiness. I'll go down and say goodbye to your father. You really are taking a long time. Wow! What a beautiful Haori (kimono jacket). This is an expensive garment. In fact it's a sample! (writes her name: Kiwa FUNAKI) Thanks for coming, sensei. - I've called you not to call me "sensei". What else can I call you? On-nee-san would be a bit... I do have a name! Where's your exhibit, Okamoto-san? Will you look at it? It's over there. This one! "Woman K washing her hair" by Goro Okamoto Who's this "K"? It's you - What? Me? Just copying the form isn't art. You must throw you life at the canvas. You may feel I've over-expressed the personal emotion but... Setsuko! KIwa, you're so lucky. You can afford to spend time at an art gallery! I'm pursued by debt collectors! I'm going to have to shut up business. And what's more... Etsuko! I can see our school. Even though those military drills during the war were terrible. We were just children. I cry when I go up to a high place... This wide world with seemingly no man for me... Really? Yes. How about you? Have you given up because of all the war dead? I hate giving up! But I don't want to marry in haste. And with a handsome chap like this around! When did you model for him? No I... I painted her intrinsic existence... it's an abstract painting. So it's not the real person but... it's a deforme conception. Setsuko... Mr love is... That Mt Hiei over there. Every day its colours change. I really want to dye my fabric to those colours! Funaki bought this shop. He planned to hold an exhibition. - It would have been tomorrow. I prepared all my products for it! It's the best place in Kyoto. Better than a department store for attracting attention. The dyers, designers and Ikebana teachers all come here. Particularly the celebrated Osawa... unlike you who just telephoned. Comes with presents and did ohyakudo at a shrine for luck. We handle Tegaki Yuzen and the wax drawings. Kimono are a bit behind the trends... We plan to take more western clothing from now on. I'm sorry to have troubled you. Hang on a second. How about doing an exhibition at one of my customer's shops? Careful! Your missus will get angry! If you spend too much time on Kiwako! Will you shut up! Let me come around to your place and see some pieces. How about it? Wow! It's the first time I've seen such freshness. Small retailers will like them. the Sakuraya shop really wanted them but... I inherited the Omiya business more than ten years ago now. I've never seen such colours. If you need money I can loan as much as you need. That's what you do as your business. A fish always senses water. I've got a request. You want to ask me a favour? Can you introduce me to some shops in Osaka? Around Shinsaibashi? Got it! OK. I will. Anywhere! Not just in Osaka but Tokyo, Nagoya and Fukuoka and... Your wife is here. My wife? - Yes. Thank you. I wonder what the hell she wants! What do you think of this neck tie? It's my idea for men! Wow! Please have some tea. What do you want? Nobody asked you to come. You go out to the dyer yet leave the samples. I wondered what you were up to! I brought them so your visit won't be wasted. Oh, you're so good! Who told you I was here? Was it Sakuraya? Let me help! Hello. Nice to meet you. I'm Omiya's wife. I'm sorry to interrupt your business talk. I didn't realise he was actually working. My husband is good natured and friendly. But he sometimes shoves his way in where he's not necessarily wanted! Please forgive him. That's enough. I go anywhere if there's work to do. Thanks to your husband some shops that are your customers will look at these samples of mine. Oh! I see. Mr Omiya, I have dozens of customers around Karamachi and Teramachi. Leave it to me. - Yes indeed. Call for the car. - OK. You do look funny wearing that necktie. That's also one of my pieces. How about this? It matches my favourite bag. Shall I dye one for you? I've got a new idea for Nara-based design. Excuse me! Would you be kind enough to take a photo? Yes, of course. - We want a group picture. Father, I've asked this lady to take it. - Oh... thank you. Not at all. It should already be in focus. OK. Well I... Are you ready? Thank you! Sorry to have troubled you. Would you let me take one with my camera? Of course. I'll put your tea here. Thank you. Dad! That lady's bag... It's the same pattern as your tie! - So it is! This bag... and the tie were both made by me. Really? If you're interested in dyed goods this is my business card. I don't have a card but my name is Takamura. From Osaka University. Can I have look? - Of course. Could I make something for the young lady perhaps? - Yes. Wow, it's beautiful! Father, the rain's stopped now. We should have stayed longer! Yes. Look! A rainbow! Oh yes! Oh Rainbow -like wisdom to mankind ... who was it ... Who separated the skies? That rainbow is a symbol of happiness, bringing blessing to his children on earth Oh such skies Lord God Don't overdo it, dad. Why not have a rest? You're dyeing exclusively red today. I have to do the rest. I hate pale colours! It's good to see you being feminine from time to time. Don't I look like a girl? I... I feel bad for you. And you not liking that marriage proposal... It's really because you're worried about me, isn't it? But you're almost 30. You should either marry or adopt an heir. What are you doing? Look dad! A rainbow! Foolishness You're still just such a kid! Kiwa? The May Day parade is coming! Shall we go and have a look for Toshio? He'll be marching at the very front. Quickly! Shall we go and see? Foolishness! Which of us did you say is like a kid? Kiwa! There's a visitor. Called Takemura. Sounds like they're from Tokyo. Ah, it's sensei! Who? Who is this Takemura? He works at Osaka University. Well well! I was working. Welcome. Actually, I want to ask you to do something for me. Thank you so much for placing an order. It's for an alumni gift you said... so what kind of pattern would you like? It's up to you. But not the same as the necktie. I want that to be completely mine. Yes, it's thanks to that tie that you bought that... Actually this was a gift from somebody. Oh, I see. I couldn't afford this on my salary. I wanted you to have this. Your fingers are... Ooops! I was in a hurry so I couldn't wash the dye off completely. That's actually like the colour that I'm trying to discover! There's a small fly called the Shoujobae that you find on sake and fruit. They breed quickly and are used for genetic experiments. I'd love to come and have a look at your lab. You'd be very welcome. I must be going to my Alumni meeting. Allow me... - No I.... Long time no see. Have you been busy? It's kind of you to ask. I'm doing OK. - Thank you very much. Is he one of your customers? I'm not a major customer. Thank you. Please come again. Thank you for waiting. - What do people pray for here? Business. And dancing and singing arts, Do you believe in it? - Not really. It's just a habit of mine. Thank you. I know my way from here. Does it trouble you if I'm with you? Not at all. I was wondering if it bothered you. Well well... Allow me to introduce... This is Goro Okamoto. From the University of Arts. This is Takemura-sensei. From Osaka University. I'm taking an important client to his meeting. I see. I'm off to the event in Tokyo. I'll come and consult you about my order when I get back. I'll come and see you another time. Mr Takemura! Thanks to you I've been able to relax for the first time in a while. How many days is the Tokyo conference? 4-5 days but please don't worry if it's too much trouble. You go first - I don't like being seen from behind! I'm the same. Give my regards to your daughter. I'd like you to use my work as well as hers! Not just Ms Funaki's roketsu products! I'd like you to introduce my work as well. I see. But my taste is rather more for what you might call pure kimono. Kimono are a bit military in feel. They're on the way to extinction. You need to mix in some western-style clothing. Well... Please come in. Miss Kiwa! Hello! I saw your pieces. They're wonderful. I wish you the best for your exhibition. Thank you very much. Well, Mr Omiya? Goodbye! Goodbye. Did I interrupt you? - No, far from it. You rescued me! I was being pursued! And just look how she dresses! Welcome. What kind of coffee can I get for you? We have Mocha, Viennese... - Just bring us something. Choice is a pain! Just give us a mixture! I wonder if you might be so kind as to do my a favour. You don't need to be so formal. I feel we're getting quite close. There's a show in Matsuya department store in Tokyo. Will you show my products? Really? Let's go! I'll pay! You're doing the job to introduce my work so... I will pay for my travel. Thank you. That sounds great. Especially coming from a woman. People might think I'm your lover! Thanks to you, Ebisuya in Osaka... What did they say? They said they are unable to exhibit Rozome (wax dye) products. The bastards! I'll not be doing business with them any more! No, I'll go directly and keep trying. Ms Funaki you... You're tougher than you look! I take my hat off to such a woman. You're too kind. You're just the kind of intellectual woman I've always wanted to go out with. I was quite popular with women in my university days! Although I had to abandon my studies partway though. Please come in. What do YOU want? Nice to see you again. Waiter! - Yes, Madam? Coffee. We have Vienesse, Brazilian, Mocha... - Whichever. Hang on. I want three sugars. Yes, Madam. I can drink coffee too you know. Thank you. See you later. - OK. Here's money for the train back. - Thank you. I already told you by post we don't need your rozome. You did, but I thought I should show you the actual things. In Osaka roketsu dyeing is not in fashion. But between here and Shinsaibashi... There are at least 5 or 6! More than we have in Kyoto! I'll be exhibiting in Tokyo at the end of the month. And? May I help you? Kamigata is 6 months ahead of Tokyo! What's popular here will normally then go to Tokyo. This one is sunset on Mt Hiei! Mt Hiei? Not really a name to excite, is it? What's that supposed to be? Picasso? Sogetsu-style? This is Willows along the Horikawa. You're using really hard to do colours. They'll be expensive. It looks gorgeous and the prices are not bad. We don't sell cheap stuff. Our customers have discerning tastes! I'm pleased to hear it. You're quite a little saleswoman, aren't you. Even I can't beat you! Excuse me! Can you show me that one! - Please come in. Bring tea for the customer. - OK. How do you like this? - It's called "waves". This is a brand new pattern. Very modern and pretty. It suits her well, doesn't it? Yes, but for you I think maybe this one... The pattern is "Mt Mikasa". It's so beautifully depicted! Well, then I'd like you to make me up some. Mr Hada? What? Come and look at this red! We finally managed to fix it! Wow, deep crimson! This is good news! At the next conference it won't be just a plan to discover how to do it! We can report the experimental results on the colour itself! Using shojobae.... This is a world first, isn't it? - Yes, it is. A similar gene mutation has been done in canaries. It's thanks to your help that we've managed to get so far! Sensei! - What is it? There's a lady from Kyoto. She says if you're too busy she'll... Kyoto? Ah! Show her in. - OK. Please come in. Sensei! Hello, welcome! Can you take photos of these two please. I'm going to the breeding room. Can you show our guest around. OK. If now is not a good time... No, it's fine! I came to invite you to lunch. I have something to celebrate. In which case let me treat you! I just got paid for an article! Excuse me just a moment. Over here! Would you like to look? Yes, thank you. The red-fly research has finally succeeded! Really? This is it! Wow! That's beautiful! Congratulations! - Thank you! I was waiting and waiting for you to visit the lab. I was worried that you'd say I was in the way and tell me to get out! What's the good news you mentioned? I made a great sale today! Do I look the type? Well... I can see that! Because I'm like a man? - No, you're very feminine! That's the first time someone's called me feminine! But I don't intend to use that in order to make sales. Of course! But even if you don't intend it the other person may well respond! Flies are male and female too! You seem to like flies better than people! Yes, my wife often says so. There's a place in Tokyo where they'll show my designs. Are you going to Tokyo as well? - Yes. There's an exhibition in a place in Ginza. I made some designs with lots of red flies. I thought of it after we spoke the other day. It's the same colour as the one you discovered. Wow! Using that colour? You're faster than me! Is there a fly? Fly? No, no, it's fine! It's just something I said. Don't worry. I'll take care of your husband. Thank you! Please return him safely. It's so nice to be loved, isn't it? - That's not funny. Why so grumpy? - I was going to buy tea. Tea? You should have told me earlier! It's probably too late. Good evening. Miss Funaki! Are you not travelling with my husband? I see. Well he's already left for Tokyo. Shall we have a coffee? I think you have time. What a delightful surprise. Come on then. Are you still open? - Yes, please sit down. Tea please. So we're on the same train! - I'm actually running late. I see. You look tired though. Have you been busy? Yes, I have. I wanted to give you this. It matches the kimono! Oh! Thank you! Red flies! It's gorgeous! Sadly my own flies are extinct! You don't mean... The heat control on the tank broke. It was the night after you visited. I may never be able to make that colour after all. I hope my visit didn't... Of course not! There's no connection at all. Please don't worry! - Oh! But... But what about your paper at the conference? I've withdrawn it. Withdrawing like this will be a black mark for me. I'm feeling pretty low about it. But someone might publish somewhere else. Mightn't they? But it doesn't matter who does it. It's for the sake of Japanese genetic science. Those flies only remain here, in your work! My prayer at the shrine has come true... Why's that? When you're at your most depressed. I'm able to be here beside you. I'll be back tomorrow morning. Say hi to your sister. See you later! Kiwa! - You're awake! Has Seikichi come home? - Yes, but he's just left again. You seem really happy. It's not on really living like this... As you see the house is tiny and he's still new in the job. He's totally focused on work in order to make sure his bosses recognise how good he is. You can't just do the same as everyone else. It's not easy as a salaryman! Always anxious for a small monthly salary. Maybe. But you've become prettier since you left home! Your skin glows. I think it's the climate! You're the one sleeping late... And your eyes are watering... You've got a lover, haven't you? No. There's a fly. A shoujo fly. A shoujo fly? What do you think? It's quite difficult to show the beauty of the flies. I don't quite understand this pattern. She's mysterious. You can never tell when she'll turn up! Hey, Kiyohara, do you know where Kiwa is? Why should I know if you don't? Today was no good for me. That's a pity. Are you sure you don't need to be at work? Meeting you has made me forget work. Can I accompany you? Of course. I said no in Maruyama park and you got angry with me. I didn't get angry with you! Actually, the reason I came to Tokyo... Was that I wanted to see you. She doesn't seem to be here... I wonder what's happened. No need to keep reminding me. Wherever she may be it's on the way here. No need to keep reminding me. Hello? It's for you. OK. Hello. Yes, it's me. Oh, it's you. I thought I was early but... He's a man after all... I'm on my way. Hang on. What shall I do? I'm fed up with waiting. You seem to need my company after all... Ah, who said I need you? - Fair enough then. Get out of here then, - All right then. As you wish. Can you order me a car, please. To Gotanda. Hurry up and go if you're going! Well, I'm off. OK then... Excuse me. Come in! Is the car here? - No, the gentleman's companion is here. Really? Well well... - Please come in. Please come in. See, here she is! Hurry up and get out of here! Excuse me! Please come in. Over there... - I'm sorry I'm late. I've only just arrived myself. Do you fancy a bath? Yes, I will. It's a really nice bath. What do you want? - Ah, there it is! Get on your way, then! - But the car's not here yet. Well you can wait in the lobby, surely. I suppose I could. As you advise me then, sempai! Out of respect for you. Have a nice time! Now let me see, which is for Gotanda...? Not this one... ah, this one! These are for Gotanda. Please come and sit down. Let's have a drink. I was waiting and waiting! I'm terribly sorry. Thank you for making all these arrangements for me. Don't be so formal and unfriendly! Hey, Omiya... What now? - There's somebody else here. Are you deliberately trying to come between me and her? - Not at all. She's been waiting for a chance to be alone with me. - Oh! He's off to Gotanda. So tonight you and I can... What on earth do you mean? I'm obliged to you for work but... Come off it... A girl alone visiting a man in his room means... Come on! - I'm not visiting you alone! Her husband's away on a business trip and she was a bit lonely. I thought she can stay here with me tonight. You've been very helpful to my sister. Good evening and thank you for allowing me to interrupt your evening. Your car's here. - OK. Hey! - Yes? I'm coming too. - But I'm going to Gotanda. I'm going to Ginza. Hey, bring me my clothes. Quick! Oh, well. About the bill... Make that woman's and mine separate. Very well. Damn it! I'd like to make a brief speech. The weaving industry in Kyoto... The 1000 year history of the Daimonji Matsuri... The guild welcomes you, our precious clients... and thanks you for attending... Bring me a drink! Now we are facing a great wave of western dress.... and we must protect and carry on our beautiful kimono craft... and we need the help and support of all of our clients... Fortunately... That's enough formal stuff. Alright! Alright! Please enjoy the food and drink that has been prepared. Relax and enjoy yourselves. Please! So how are things going? OK, I suppose. Here's Kiwa. Good evening everyone. "Everyone"? So it's for "Everyone" is it? Because you're late Omiya here is grumpy! You are part of the invited and should be here early. WE are the guests. Isn't that so? For you men look all the same! They're just some old rag to you! What are you talking about? Omiya seems to have something against you! I'm the goddess of peace. Please solve it peacefully. Pass me your glass. So will you receive my glass? (suggests friendship) Thank you for offering. But I don't drink. Everyone having fun? There's plenty, so enjoy! Kiwa! Hey! - Leave it! So you're too good to drink from my cup, are you? Whose connections do you think you owe your success to? That pretty face of yours... Hides a different nature! I'm going to make her drink! Mr Omiya... Allow me to have a drink from your... It's none of your goddamn business... You'd better leave. I'll sort it out. Here you are. What a nasty man. Yes, indeed. Ms Funaki? There's a phone call for you from home. Kiwa? Takemura-sensei was here. Yes, but... he's left. If you hurry to the station you should still be in time. Here are some cigarettes. - Thank you. I'm so glad I managed to catch you. Where shall we go? Let's go. I wanted to see you. Me too. I've had an awful day! Awful? Yes. It's business. Rain! I think I will be moving away from Kyoto for a while. What? I've been invited to go to Okayama University. To Okayama? Is that you? Is that you, Ms Funaki? Setsuko! Come in. Why are you standing out here? Seeing Kiwa walking with a man is a rare thing. I almost didn't recognise you! Thank you. I never thought there'd be such a quiet room next to the river on festival night. We are on the river but we don't have the best view of Daimonji... We can only see it at an angle This is... It's not my business to know. What should we do? The rain seems to be continuing. maybe you should make Teruterubozu (folk tradition for stopping rain) Please change into Yukata. The bath is just down there. There's a moth. I'll turn it off. Please relax and enjoy yourselves. Would you like a drink? Yes, just a little. Me too. Oops. So you're off to some university in the back of beyond? Was it because of the failure with the shoujo flies? No, it's a personal thing that leads me to want to go. Just involving you? Moving from one university to another is a common and positive thing. What does your wife say? I haven't told her anything. I wanted to meet you before I said. I can't bear it! I can't bear you going so far away. I can't stand it. Through these hardships... Because I could see you, it kept me going. It's wrong to say it perhaps but... I know it. Even I... I didn't know I felt this way. I hadn't noticed. I feel that ... ... not saying anything... Is just too.... Kiwa! Gosh, it's hot! (sings to herself - seems to mention 'couple') Kiwa... shall I heat it up a bit? I don't mind if it's for you. Do you remember when we... went on that school trip to Tokyo? When we were in the bath together? I worshipped you back then and it was so embarrassing to see you naked. It's so long ago now it seems like a dream... It must be more than ten years ago. The rain's stopped. Are you regretting it? I'm glad. If I get pregnant... the baby will have beautiful eyes. Just like yours! That's genetics, isn't it? A child! That worries you. Don't worry. Even if I were to, I'd bring it up as mine. I'd not make any trouble for you. Kiwa... Do you hate me? Flowers for sale! Flowers for sale! I'll have some. Thank you very much Toshio... Are you really well enough to get up? Drink the milk while it's cold. Here are some crackers. Eat the vegetables quickly. And there's an apple... And an orange. You being ill.... is so unusual! Why are you suddenly being so nice to me? Still calling me sensei? But you are my sensei. Your artwork is amazing. That's why I think it's such a pity. You're the kind of person who should keep focused on your work! I'll make you some toast. I would like to establish a position for myself in art like yours in the world of dyeing. I want to establish myself. That was my aim. So I... - You certainly seem much better! I didn't need to worry and visit the sick! I believe it is arrogance for an artist.... to bring one's own subject impression into one's own work. That's why I haven't said anything until now... So when I was in Maruyama park with the man from Osaka University Not just there! Also in Daimonji! And why are you so worked up about it? I'm not worked up! Here's your milk. Surely you're not having a relationship with him, are you? I asked a friend at Osaka University. This is a personal matter of mine. Why should you say anything? You are my Beatrice. In Aristotelian terms you're my girlfriend. And I respect you. Don't make me sadder. I don't want to be lectured by a child like you. Instead of worrying you about me, worry about yourself! I value you so much and I've shared the business with you. And I feel upset when I hear rumours from people. What nasty rumours? She's very friendly with that Osaka University professor. Surely you know about it if rumours have reached my ears! Well? You need to get her a husband! I know she's very strong minded but she's a woman after all. Hey, the colour's too thin! Very well. So I kept meaning to say to you... You married someone only a bit older than Kiwa is now... She was weeping in the kitchen that night... If it hadn't been for the war she would have been happily married... And she'd have had a couple of kids by now. I reckon all this focus on work is because she's emotionally unsatisfied. I... I know. I feel parental responsibility. I blame myself and sometimes I can't sleep. By the way, I found you a new trainee. When Kiwa marries you can have him to help you. Thank you. I'm sorry we always cause problems for you. Oh well, just get on and sort it out! I will. Kiwa! I, errr... What is it? I wanted to discuss it with you first but... I discussed with Honke about the craftsman. What trainee? YOU kept saying how much a pain having someone was... Well, yes. I did but... Come in! Hi. This is the guy. I hope you get on well. I'm Kanji Haraya. I was apprentice at Yuzenya. He's a specialist in Mujizome dyeing. Nice to meet you, I hope we'll get along. She's a real beauty. It's somewhat smaller than I'd expected. Oh well. Kiwa? Takemura-san is here. Really? Sensei is... No, it's his daughter. The daughter's here? I thought he was single and he seems to have such a grown up daughter! Shall I show her in? Please come in. Welcome. I hope you're well. I was nearby at a art exhibition. Are you here alone? Yes, I left my friends at Sanjo station. Shall we go into town. But I'm still in the middle of something. Can you wait a moment? I'd like to see your room. Where you do the dyeing? Really? It's a bit messy but please come in. Thank you. This way. I won't be long. Just wait a minute. Wow! It's beautiful. What are you making? A Haori jacket. Next time I'd like to dye something for you. I dare hardly use that bag. It's much too good! Father's been up here, hasn't he? Well, once. Maybe twice. How do you know that? Dad had a paint stain on his handkerchief! Oh, do you wash your dad's things? Yes. My mother's ill. Your mother's ill? Didn't dad say anything? He probably didn't want to tell you anything unpleasant. It's been two years now... What's wrong with her? TB of the spine. She's been in the University hospital ever since... What's this? A necktie? Careful! The paint... It's fine! Shall we make something to put on your mother's wall? I don't think I should tell my mother about you. Why not? Just a feeling I have. So... Will you really come to town with me? Yes, let's go! My mum has been bed-bound. I never have enough time to explore Kyoto! Dad probably feels the same. Yes, perhaps so. Thank you for waiting. Atsuko, this is for your father... I'm delighted. I love him very much. Do you? Well, do you? Why are you asking me that? Where shall we go next? To get cake? No thank you. I'd better get back to my mother. Atsuko... Because I was very pushy just now, were you annoyed? Atsuko... Yes? Your father is a really good man. That's enough as a reply, isn't it. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for waiting. Take care. Come again. Goodbye! Kiwa! What's the matter? You look a bit down? Let's go somewhere. I wonder where would be good? Have a drink! If you keep thinking about depressing things you'll get stuck! It's either good or bad. If you love someone... whether or not they have a wife and kids.... You can't let it bother you. Yes I know. But I... I couldn't look her straight in the eyes. I was scared. I wanted to hide from her. If she knew... That pretty little girl would be so sad. I don't want her to dislike me. You're becoming paranoid. The girl was smiling quite happily. My father had three mistresses. I didn't hate them. I went from one to the other quite happily. I was spoilt! But I'm not some mistress. Well please forgive me. I may have overstepped a little. I'd love to forget him. If I only could. Even now I really want to see him. I heard your wife is ill. I didn't know that Atsuko went to visit you! I wish you'd told me earlier. I kept meaning to tell you but... Yes? Yes, it's me. It was Atsuko. Her mother's suddenly taken a turn for the worse. Does Atsuko know we're here? No. She has the number, but she thinks I'm staying at the lab. One lie on top of another. But my wife's been bed-bound for so long... And it's only human... to gradually give up. It won't be long now. What do you mean? Until what? What is it? Anybody home? Come in? It's Miyoko! Miyoko! What a surprise. I would have come to pick you up if you'd told me. I just arrived. I see. Miyoko? Yes? Why are you here? No need to ask! It's her home, isn't it! Well indeed it is. - Hi. Omiyage (a gift). It's Tsukudani. Thanks. But shouldn't you be at home. I don't see why. He's been on a business trip for a month! So I'm here. Have you eaten? Just a snack on the train! That's a very Tokyo thing to do! I'm sleepy! I'd like to sleep. Is Kiwa asleep? No, she's out the back. She was up late last night. And despite the cold she started again early this morning. She works hard. Wow. She's really going for it! Any news on an arranged marriage? No. It would be a good thing if there was but... How about this... I showed a photo of her to a senior manager at my husband's company... For a beauty like this I'd give up anything! I came here for that! Good morning. What kind of time do you call this? Sorry. I was so tired. I don't know why. I wonder if Kiwa would be happy to live in Tokyo Zokezu dyeing is certainly more popular there. She can have an apprentice and be able to send money home. But she's in love with Takemura-sensei isn't she? Takemura-sensei? Who's that? However hard I work I only get 300 yen a day. I'd earn more as a labourer! Well, "darling"? Don't call me "darling". You sister's here. - I could hear her voice from here! Mourning? Yes, step mum asked me. Did she? She's always working hard! She works so hard for us. Despite being not much older than me she's always so considerate... Silly girl! We all live under the same roof. We're a family. Look dad... I can stay here always, can't I? What's up with you this morning? The level of your work is greatly above mine! I think you're a great daughter! Having said so, girls need to get married. Your sister brought a proposal. Someone in Tokyo... I'm not going to Tokyo. Hello! - Welcome home. Here's omiyage. This letter was for you. Just arrived. From Takemura-sensei. I actually wanted to talk with you about him. It's a notification of a Kokubetsushiki (wake). His wife has died. I see. Has she been ill? I'm sorry to hear that. I wondered why you were making mourning clothes. It'll be hard to go all the way to Osaka for the wake. I wonder if it's OK for me to go? It would be rude not to. It's the wife of someone you're so close to. It's perfectly natural to go. You ought to go to the wake. Now his wife is dead things will be different. Surely... - Miyo! You know nothing about it. Keep quiet! Ms Funaki! Special delivery. - Thank you. You may be young but it's dangerous to drink like this. You've had enough. Welcome. Thank you so much for coming. Your note came special delivery... I'm sorry. It's fine. Why haven't you gone home? I was going to go after the autumn exhibition. Kyoto is too much for me. I can't make a success independently. I'm also not feeling happy. And my feelings are... I'll have some sake. Will you? Excuse me! Another glass! That's enough! If you're not in Kyoto... I'll be sad. I don't think so. I heard Takemura-sensei's wife passed away. I heard when I visited your place this morning. I thought you'd look happy. The two of you will be free to love each other. Please forgive my immature comments I'll get well and focus on my painting. That's what will save me. I'm so glad to have seen you, even for 5 or 10 minutes. Snow... This will purify our memories. I will go back to my snowy home town and pray that you two will be happy. Okamoto-san.... What? So you... You think I'll go to him? I wonder if Kiwa is seeing Takemura-sensei. We haven't seen him for quite a while. Don't mention his name in front of her. Even if she loves him she'll have her own ideas. Well, there's no longer a wife. Something will work out soon enough. I'm finished doing the moxibustion. You're such a baby about it! Anybody in? - Yes? Come in. Dear... Who is it? What? Toshio? Yes, it's me. What do you want? Excuse me... Kiwa! Yes? What is it? It's Toshio... Toshio? His job at the factory is going because of the recession... He's come to ask for a job. Poor guy. Kanji hasn't shown up to work all week! How about replacing him with Toshio? I'd rather work just with just you and me. That's the least stressful. Very true! But I won't be able to work forever. Look dad... Come and have a look at all these pieces I've built up. - OK. Ogiya said they will allow me to display my work! That's good. - Can I go now? Come upstairs in the main building! Welcome! Kiwa? He said he wanted to see it from a high place so I took him up. The cherry blossoms are completely over now. I thought you two might have had a quarrel. We always serve that tea! That's all we have. Please make yourself at home. You stopped writing to me so I was worried. Is something troubling you? You seem tired. Like some traveller from far away. About to go off on your travels again. It sounds like you're speaking of a stranger! What's wrong? You behaving strangely today. We haven't seen each other for ages. There's something I need to tell you, I have something to tell you too. You're going to ask me to marry you. Yes, I am. My family and friends... they all expect me to agree. And I am in love with you. And I love you even more than I did. But it's no good. Why not? Please remember.... I never wished your wife would die... I never wished that. I know that. But still... I feel guilty. But I... But what I want to talk about now is something different. Do you remember? That night of the Daimonji festival? The first time we came here? I talked about having a child... Ever since I've felt myself to be a coward... When I learned you wife had got worse... You told me "not much longer"... It's been like holding up a huge rock. For years and years. And now you're finally free. And feel relieved. That it was worth waiting. And now you say "Marry me"? Don't be ridiculous! I have no regrets about my wife. I did everything I could for her. You don't understand what a loving married couple is like... Men are sly waiting for the wife to die... Pretending to be a victim but actually... Waiting and waiting for your wife to die... I just can't handle that! - What do you mean? I don't understand! Kiwa! Forgive me. Suddenly blurting this out. But, let's break up. But let's stay good friends. Let's do that. I... I respect you greatly. Let's shake hands. Miss Kiwa! The May Day parade is coming! Is it May Day? - What, didn't you know? I went last year, but this year's even bigger! Are there really so many people? Yes! Let's go up and look. Quickly! The skies are clear.... the wave is here the passion and heat of the sun... heats us to work and makes the world a better place Let's use that power and work! The End Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
