Forensic Psychiatry? For what? She's got a diagnosis from a psychiatrist. She was sexually abused in her foster home. Then she stabbed her foster father. I tried to look deeper about it.

Jung-ho! Are you okay? I'm fine Just get Soo-yeon. What do you mean! Suck it up! Detective Kim, there's no time. I'll be right back, hang in there. Mr. Ryu... I've never seen anybody who died like him before. Covering his eyes like that... Unfortunately... If she doesn't get a cornea transplant, she'll permanently lose her sight. Ryu Jung-ho lies here He must be glad to see you visit him. The sound of birds, winds. They're beautiful, huh? I bet he's listening to those, too, right? He can't hear. He got in a car accident. Since then, he lost his hearing. You wanna know a little secret? But he said he can communicate with his eyes, and his heart. We often miss even the things we see. The girl is wishing him a happiness. I feel like I know what he was talking about. That he will be fine now. Right? Why are you smiling? I just... feel so comfortable around you. I don't think about anything. I don't worry about anything. That's because... You like me so much. How do you know that? You can't even hear me. I can... listen to your heart.
