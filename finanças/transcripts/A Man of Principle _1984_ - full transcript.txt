A MAN OF PRINCIPLE Colombia, second half of the 19th century. For 100 years, the Liberal And the Conservative parties had been fighting each others in a series of civil wars that bloodstained the country. The last one, called the ''Violence'' was triggered by the assassination of leader Gaitan on April 9th 1948. This event led to a 10 years era of darkness and became the Golden Age for political assassins known as ''los Pajaros'' (the birds). Leon Maria Lozano, alias ''the Condor'' was the most infamous. Get all of them! Uncle Pedro... Catch that horse! Stop him! He's burning alive! Put it out! And what about the massacre at Resolana? The burning remains of the victims of this horrible crime... ...were brought here... ...chilling testimony... ...to the violence unleashed by Masons and atheists... ...against our Christian families. We all know who he's talking about! Father Amaya blames the liberals. He thinks you are innocent... ...and we're the villains. These criminals spared no one... ...not even the children! All were victims! What did that boy do to deserve such a death? And that unfortunate family, what was their offense? Being good Christians? Or perhaps... ...being Conservatives? Let enemies of the faith beware! They have sown the wind, and shall reap the whirlwind! The rider of the Apocalypse shall come to destroy them all! It was good to see you, Madam Gertrudis. Likewise. How are you? Your father? How are you, Alvarado? Arriving at the end of mass, hey? Didn't see you inside. Are you the Masons or atheists... ...Father Amaya spoke of? He did? Why? The Resolana massacre. I'm trying to find out about that. ...I know nothing, Alvarado Seems to have been terrible. Father Amaya claims it's political. That is serious. Leon Maria... How are you? Goodbye gentlemen. What is it? Who's this girl? My daughter, Madam Gertrudis. Well, what is it? Mr. Gustavo Gardeazabal told me... ...the shop is doing poorly. And I thought perhaps you... ...being so highly regarded... ...that you might find a place for me. Let me see what I can do, Leon Maria. The regrettable fall. . . of the Conservative government in 1930. . . marked the beginning of a painful era. . . . . . of disregard for human life. . . . . .with innocent Conservatives. . . as the victims. The struggle. . . . . .the long and arduous struggle. . . . . . of the Conservative Party. . . . The lottery is next monday, Dolores. Good luck! Your last name? Good morning, Leon Maria. How about buying a ticket? Just two pesos. Look, take this 7! You're wasting your time! No thanks. Mr. Leon Maria Lozano Buying a ticket... ...for the Liberals! Of course! Leon Maria's Conservative! Right, Mr Zapata...and proud of it! There's no such thing as a good Conservative! You're not going to screw us on elections! We have a majority. And we'll prove it! If your lot wins, we can go to hell. A little respect! Respect? For what? Look, Leon Maria... ...shit on your Conservative Party! How much is this book? That one is banned. I've got church dispensation. Two pesos. Shall I wrap it? No, this is fine. Goodbye, Leon Maria. Father Amaya sent me for this book. How are you, Agobardo? Another book for Father Amaya? Tell him to stop by sometimes... ...it won't hurt him. Even I go to mass once in a while! How are sales? This book and another for Mr. Santacoloma. The shop is loosing money. A new shipment is about to arrive and I can't pay for it. As I told you last month... ...don't count on... ...working here much longer. Another of those attacks? Here is something... ...my grandfather used. He also had those attacks. How long has it been? Since I was nine... They were so bad... ...that my parents took me to an healer. He looked in my eyes... ...with a magnifying glass. And told me all that would happen... ...because of asthma. He said I would die in the street. That's why I'm afraid to go out... I run in when I feel, an attack coming. Madam, the mayor is here. Show him in! Please sit down, my friend. I came when I got your message Madam Gertrudis. I wanted to speak to you. It's about Leon Maria Lozano, He would do well selling cheese. I know the job is vacant. You put me in a difficult position. Rodriguez wants the job. Find him something else. I want that job for Leon Maria. Give it to him... ...even if he's a Conservative! This is for Gertrudis Potes. And this for Father Amaya. That's Gaitan! Turn that radio off! He's going to wreck the country! Some leader! These herbs are miraculous. They never fail. Paquita's niece tried them and is much better. They're good for rheumatism. Who else was here? No one. Are you sure? Expecting someone? No one. Where did you go? Nowhere. Don't forget... I don't want you going out without Aunt Carmelita. You've told me a thousand times! Cover yourself! We're alone! Someone could come in... ...besides, it's a matter of principle! Liberals, to the poles! On to a Liberal victory ! Good morning.... We won the elections! You haven't won anything! But we did win! Don't talk to that Mason! Understand? They've killed Gaitan! Here is the latest bulletin .. This is the Voice of the People. . . to the revolutionaries. . . . . .in Colombia. . . . . .from somewhere in the country. Rosa, they're looting your shop! Down with the Conservatives! Viva the Liberal Party! Where were you? I was terrified! I heard they're setting fire to the churches! Viva the revolution! All divisions. . . . . . of the police force. . . . . .have joined the revolutionaries! To city hall! Power to the Liberals! My dear brothers... Yesterday... ...a terrible sacrilege was avoided... ...by the grace of God. Liquor kept us out of power. But, we're in power. Now, there's a coalition! This government won't last long. It must! The country is in chaos. There are still snipers in Bogota. And there, without Leon Maria Lozano... ...disaster! It's unbelievable... Leon Maria Lozano, a hero! Is he from here? It's the fifth this week. Politics! WILL ARRIVE FRIDAY TO DISCUSS... ...SERIOUS PARTY PROBLEMS. REGIONAL CONSERVATIVE COMMITTEE ...to discuss... ...Regional Conservative Committee... I received the same telegram. What do you think? Why are they coming? What's happening? I don't like it. As President of the Regional Committee... ...I have to cooperate... ...but, I don't like it. Why? They're dissatisfied with the Liberal police... ...and want their own people... ...just in case of emergency. I just don't like it! As for me, I follow orders! Obedience to the party is important. It's a matter of principle! We remember what you did, Mr. Leon Maria. Your courage is well-known to the party... ...church leaders and the entire country. Therefore, we want to rely on you... ...to see our principles... ...and institutions are protected... ...and to defend the governement. Imagine! There was a drunk on my doorstep. He bothered you? No, thank heavens! He was dead drunk! One just can't go out alone! - What time was it? - At dawn. Shot in the neck. My wife heard a truck go by earlier. There's the mayor! Hear about the body? He wasn't from around here. Do you think it's related to the others? I know nothing. It looks political to me! I'd like to put this on the radio. I know nothing. Don't touch anyone from here! ...the guy on the radio? No! He's a friend of Madam Gertrudis. But, let's do this... Bring in some bodies To scare them. A police bulletin states. . . That two unidentified bodies were found. . . They found them near the church. I was going by. Both had a bullet in the neck. Like the last one! Why do they drop them here? It's the Conservatives. Whoever it is... ...they had better not cross me! Nor me either! You should have seen the deposit Leon Maria made! It's not from selling cheese. You've got to do something, Mr. Gardeazabal! - Mayor... - Please, Mr Gardeazabal, not now! It's serious. This woman says they are going to attack her home. You must act! AT least send a patrol! I can't do anything. Didn't you hear it on the radio? What are you talking about? You don't know? Well, I'll tell you! I'm not the mayor! The Liberals left the governement. Therefore...I'm out! So, talk to my successor. Did you hear the news. We'll defend the Faith, by any means! Mr. Gardeazabal, open the door! Last night they came and took them away! They burned our homes! We went to the cemetery... ...but they wouldn't let us in. The birds are out every night attacking Liberals homes. And what are we doing? Waiting... ...for orders that never come! In Bogota, they don't know what's happening... ...and now, people are being killed nearby. Put that on the radio, Alvarado! What do you think of the bodies found in the streets? I don't know, Mr. Alvarado. There are none in my street. How should I know? What song first? Pedacito de Cielo. Is that music? Keep quiet! Get out! I'm sorry to bother you. No problem, Mr. Leon Maria. I'm pleased you came. You've served the party well. A scholarship for your daughter is no problem... I'll see to it this afternoon. Incidentally, the new mayor is arriving next week... He'll take what you need. The mayor can't see anyone right now. He has urgent business first. Come back tomorrow. Goodbye, Mr. Leon Maria, I'll always be glad to help. Look who just walked in. Those thugs are Lozano's bodyguards. ''Birds''...the worst ones! It's happening here! Now, we're all in danger. Madam Gertrudis is imagining things... Who'd have killed Zapata for politics? It was the Conservatives. Not surprising, Zapata didn't waste words. Now they say it's getting worse Let's stop wasting time and organize! We can shoot too! Why should I be quiet! Is Mr. Restrepo in? He won't be long. Someone is waiting for you. I'm coming, Andres! Expecting anyone else? Leon Maria Lozano. Are you serious? My God, Gertrudis... That assassin! Do you know why dogs bite? They smell fear! But, what do we say? That we are still strong! Agripina...paper! Madam, they say... The mayor just ordered a curfew. Leon Maria Lozano, please ...tell him Gertrudis Potes is here... ...along...and after curfew. No, he's out. Madam Agripina is there. He said he'd be at the ''Happy Bar''. Did you go to Bellavista? Lamparilla will go. With who? He has his own people. Is Rodriguez still there? Yes, but Rojas is busy and... ...there's no one else. We need more men. We should go to San Jeronimo. Some of our people are locked up there. Watch the corner! Get the guns! Viva the Conservative Party! Open up! Everybody out! Are these your men? What do you want? Well look, mayor... ...you're holding innocent men. They're all common criminals! Everyone outside! Now, defend this government! Who put you in jail? The Reds! Opposing the government in a crime! The rest is crap. We've got a lot of enemies here.... ...you ought to help us eliminate them. Eliminate who? The Liberals... There are a lot of Liberals here... I know them. Don't forget April 9th! The Reds put you here! And, where are they? Don't they have any balls! Let's go get'em! Before you touch anyone here... ...you'll have to kill me first! Look, I'll make you a deal. Get these men out of here... ...and I'll have the Liberals out in a week. I promise... ...but leave now, please! One week, mayor! It's a good offer... ...better than nothing. At least you'll get something! It's a good farm, Mr. Leon Maria. True...but I don't have the money. But, it's a gift! Navarro wants to buy it but we didn't let him. As I said...that's for the rich! Money doesn't interest me! What the party pays me is enough. It's a matter of principle! How are you? They told us... ...you were here and we decided to come. It's good to see you. I've had no news all week. Any news from Bogota? It seems things are bad. Well, yes... ...and, there's something new... ...they're sending these notes to the Liberals... ...telling them to leave town... ...or the land. I've heard about these notes...... ...written in Gothic script. They've got imagination! ''Birds''! That's what today's paper calls them! ''Birds''! Well, around here their leader is a ''Condor''! The Condor! ...not a bad name for Leon Maria. He's ignoring our warning. Send him a note. Perea, write this down. Upon receiving this notification... ...you have one week to leave your farm. If not, be prepared for the consequences What was that? I said...one week... ...to leave. If not... ...be prepared! Shut those dogs up! And the Boteros? They think we're joking. Perea, do this one too! Upon receiving this notification... ...you have five days to leave town. Last warning! If not, be prepared for the consequences! The old man in front is furious. His dog is dead. Who'll deliver them? Lamparilla is busy tomorrow... Jose Castro will go. Damn you! Damn you all! When can we have them? At 8:00 in the morning. I'm coming. Mr. Leon Maria sends his regards. Bar the door! The Ayalas sent these buns. Thank you. Leon Maria, I'm sick. I've got a pain... ...in my left arm. My God, they have poisoned Leon Maria Lozano! Get some big pans. They say he's dying. I just saw... ...Carmelita Lozano go in. They're going to burn the house! Don't worry...go to the kitchen! It's not easy to kill a condor! This is the third time! Damn! Mayor... ...We've been asked by a group of prominent citizens... ...to formally protest... ...crimes committed against the lives... ...and property of our people. Some even say the authorities... ...are doing nothing to stop it. That's what the Liberals say... ...but it's not true. We are here to protect the people... ...and our institutions. While you're here, Mr. Alvarado... ...let me give you the latest decree... ...for your broadcast. Decree n Y 1 453... The national government hereby... ...awards The Order of San Carlos... to Mr. Leon Maria Lozano. . . author of many civic deeds. . . . . .whom assassins tried to murder. . . . . .thus hoping to rob his town of an eminent son. Mr. Arango? Yes that's me. Here's a note for you. A note? You have 7 days, to leave the area. If not, abide by the consequences. Listen! You want me out? We'll see! Who'll do it, you? They'll have to shoot me first! ...but I'll get you too! Come on, fight! Bastards! Stay out! Can't you see I'm busy! Why are you here? Who took care of Arango? No one, yet. He is in town... ...saying how tough he is... ...and to hell with us! Finish him off, now! Really? And nothing has happened yet? Yes, I'll tell him. Goodbye. Hear about Arango? - Who? - Arango. A crazy farmer who's been insulting Leon Maria Lozano. Why? He got a note. They're betting two to one he won't make it home. This I can't miss! They shot him! Well, what happened? Nothing, Mr. Leon Maria. Arango Wasn't at the funeral! He left town! Listen : I don't want any more mistakes! You have 24 hours to get him! Now, move! Any news, mayor? How was the funeral? I stopped by... ...it was an accident! ...but after all, it's one less Liberal! Who was there? Not many people. They're learning. Gertrudis Potes was the only one to speak up. A tough old woman! She even mentioned you, Leon Maria... ...as the leader of the ''birds''. The Condor! Brave old gal, hey? Let's send her a note? Just to scare here! - Dear brothers... - Father Amaya... After the Resolana massacre... ...you condemned outrages... ...comitted against your parishioners. I'd like you to read this... ...to the congregation. I just found it under my door. We're in church! This letter must be signed by all of us... ...and sent to every major newspaper. Now, even we are being threatened... ...and may be forced out. The censors won't approve it. I think it's dangerous. Mentioning the ''Condor'' is going too far. Some of the phrasing has to be changed. I can't commit myself. We have to commit ourselves! As thing stand, we may be killed anyway! What a nerve! Santacoloma that rich bastard is the worst! There's a picture! And the censors? Even Arrieta! I think it's time... ...to teach them a lession! He's inside. I saw him go in. Break down the door! They shot him. Who is it? Santacoloma, he also signed the letter. They made me pay. In response to a pastoral from the cardinal... ...addressed to all parishes... ...we have formed this Peace Committee... ...made up of civil and church authorities... ...leading members of the community... ...as well as... ...''the Women's Charity''... ...Catholic Action... ...and the Sacred Heart of Jesus. This violence must stop. Half those who signed are dead. ...and in the past two weeks... ...aside from 1 4 killed at Anserma. ...27 people were murdered in Bolivar. Everyone is dead at Recreo! Last night they murdered 11 children... ...and raped the women then killed them with machetes. Who did the killing? Who gave the order? He asked who ordered it! Who let them mess with the women? Where you at Recreo? We don't know anything about it. I heard it was Ortega's men but I'm not sure. Everyone thought you gave the order. Me! Stay tuned for a special bulletin. . . What's happening? Listen to that crowd! Who's knocking? The maid isn't here! My God! Open the door! They've overthrown the government! This a personal letter from the minister. You'll have a pension.... ...and everything necessary to move your belongings. We hope you understand... Things are different now. But, you have nothing to worry about. We trust the mayor here! It's him...the Condor adaptation : Vieng Savang VONGSA sincro: Austeridad
