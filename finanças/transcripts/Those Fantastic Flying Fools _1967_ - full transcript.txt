(Lion roaring) (dramatic music) (cheerful swing music) (heroic music) (hooves clopping) [Narrator] The queen, God bless her. Queen Victoria, the symbol of her age. An age of progress, beauty and virtue. An age when science blossomed like a magic flower. And all mankind fell beneath its spell. To this generation, all things seemed possible. The scientist and the engineer were personally encouraged by royalty, and at the forefront of every experiment were the nobility. Men like his grace, the Duke of Barset. As it is men like our beloved cousin, the Duke of Barset, who have done so much to encourage the advancement of science, thereby enriching the daily life of our subjects throughout the empire, and so, before pulling this main switch, we would like to congratulate him on becoming the first man to illuminate this house completely by electricity. (Loud hissing) (bell ringing) (driver shouting) (flames crackling) [Narrator] Fired by enthusiasm, Victorians probed ever deeper into the mysteries of science, and thereby achieved miracles of engineering. The Trent Suspension Bridge, crowning glory in the career of that great civil engineer, Sir Charles Dillworthy. And so it gives us the greatest pleasure to open this new suspension bridge, the Trent, to be designed and constructed by Sir Charles Dillworthy. (Band music fanfare) (loud rumbling) (horse whinnying) (loud crashing) [Narrator] An age of experiment, of trial and error, and at this hour of trial, Sir Charles Dillworthy realized his error. His business partner, Captain Sir Harry Washington Smythe, public works contractor, financial genius, sportsman. How exactly does it work? It's quite simple, Captain, really. Electro-magnetic bars in each pocket. You merely switch on, with your selector switch here, which pocket you want, and you play. Not with those, Captain. Centers of solid steel. Ah hah! (Billiard balls clicking) By jove Grundle, it's an actual corker! I mean one can't possibly lose. And the patent is yours, Captain, for the trifling sum of 50 guineas. My dear fellow, you will have my personal check. In that case, I shall offer it to the Marquis of Angleby. Grundle, I'll tell you what, how about my solid gold watch? Done. [Narrator] Not all the applications of science brought such obvious rewards to mankind. Applied to less peaceful ends, it resulted in the development of new and ever more terrible weapons of war. Professor Sigfried von Bulow, explosives expert to the Kaiser. Your Imperial Majesty, I would like to demonstrate for you now, the cannon helmet. (Trumpet fanfare) With aid of this helmet, every infantry man is converted into a piece of mobile artillery. (Dramatic music) (tuba music) (suspenseful music) (loud banging) (rocket whistling) (loud explosion) (men clapping) (coughing) [Narrator] Thanks to science, man's vision of the future was clear and optimistic, and nowhere was optimism more apparent than America. The New York office of the great Phineas T. Barnum, great showman, great optimist. Congratulations gentlemen, by joining me in this new venture, you've ensured for each and every one of us a brilliant future. We are deeply indebted to you, Mr. Barnum. Oh no, no, no, don't thank me. I want you to share with me in the benefits of this great new enterprise, and it will be truly great my friends, not just an American show, not merely the greatest attraction in the civilized world, but a truly terrestrial attraction, the greatest show on earth! Mr. Barnum. (Mechanical clicking) What in the name of tarnation is that contraption? That, sir, is a teleprinter, connected directly with my manager's office in Philadelphia. By means of that machine he will keep us informed of our progress. Entire show burned to the ground. Stop. Fear you are completely ruined. Stop. Advise you to leave the country immediately. Stop. Hey, stop! (Pounding on door) (muffled shouting) (light cheerful music) Well, General, in about 15 minutes we'll meet the Liverpool pocket. No sign of it yet, Barnum. Hey, what will we do when we get to England? - Make a fortune. - Oh, how? Well, that minor detail we"ll take care of when we get there. (Regal music) (crowd of men murmuring) Ah Charles, how nice to see you again. Yes, Barset, the usual crowd of fools and charlatans, I see. [Both] Good evening, your grace. Oh, good evening. You heard about my brig, I suppose. Oh, yes, yes, may I offer you my deepest sympathies. A terrible disaster. I was victimized, Barset, victimized. Dishonest contractors, inferior materials. I was betrayed by the company, Barset, betrayed. Yes, yes, terrible. I would like to greet you, sir. I'm Barset, president of the society. Barnum, Phineas T. Barnum. Barnum, not the great Barnum? At you service, sir. Oh, why, yes, yes of course. And this must be little Tom Thumb. General Tom Thumb. I do beg your pardon. Yes, of course. I had no idea that you were in England. We just arrived today, sort of slipped in without any fuss, you know. It's very nice to see you at our lecture. Lecture? Yes, yes, we shall be starting any moment now. Do come this way a little bit. Gentlemen, I think we really must be going in. And so, with this new explosive substance, which I call bulovite, understand, bul-o-vite. It is possible that a projectile could be fired, which would escape completely from the gravitational pull of the earth and travel through the upper reaches of the atmosphere. I continue. Aah... (loud snoring) Huh? (Snorting) This explosive will revolutionize gunnery as we know it today. A projectile fired beyond the earth's atmosphere would have a range which is infinite. In fact, such a projectile could reach the moon. (Audience laughing) How would you fire such a projectile, professor? From a cannon. (Audience laughing) You would have to construct an enormous cannon. (Audience laughing) Please, please, gentlemen! Professor von Bulow is our guest. Professor, in your opinion, could such a projectile carry a human being? Could a man travel in it? Yes, if he was a small man. Naturally, sir, and of course, provided the human body could survive such a trip. Well sir, speaking as a physician, I can assure you that the human system is quite incapable of surviving at such a velocity. [Charles] Nonsense. Are you questioning my medical judgement sir? Yes, indeed I am sir. When we engineers first constructed a railway, it was you physicians who said that no one could travel at 20 miles an hour and survive. And judging by the railways you construct, sir, they were right. That's an attack on my reputation. That's a personal attack. Let me tell you this, for what it's worth. People are a darn sight safer on my railway than they are in your surgery. And you can stuff that up your stethoscope. (Audience shouting chaotically) Did you hear what that man said? I have never been so insulted. Order, gentlemen, please! Order. Please! (Loud whistling) Please, gentlemen, please let us not get overheated. I beg of you. Who is this fellow? Not a member, is he? Gentlemen, may I introduce to you Mr. Phineas I. Barnum. (Audience exclaiming) Gentlemen, gentlemen, when I received an invitation to this meeting, I thought perhaps at first there had been some mistake. But now I discern the hand of providence has sent me here this evening. The professor here has mentioned the possibility of a journey to the moon. A voyage to another planet. Think upon this, gentlemen, perhaps one of us here in this very room, may be the first man to set foot upon the moon. Now, who will join me on a committee to instigate this magnificent adventure? I'll join you, Mr. Barnum, yes indeed I will. And so will I. I will join this committee. [Both] We will. Thank you gentlemen. This meeting will go down in history. The meeting at which it was first decided to send a living human being to the moon. (Audience applauding) Hooray, hooray. Read all about it, Barnum sensation. - Barnum sensa... - Boy! Barnum proposes trip to the moon. Sir Charles Dillworthy and the Duke of Barset also joined the committee, and there is great speculation as to who will be the first person to be sent to the moon. I wonder what Mr. Gladstile is doing. Your Imperial Highness, von Bulow is going to the moon! - Good! - (Musical fanfare) (soft romantic music) Gaylord, Gaylord, you must not go to the moon. Gaylord? But Gaylord, you must not go up to the moon just because of me. I am not going up to the moon, I am merely going over the channel to England. Oh, and what about me? You, that's all you ever think about, isn't it, you? Well, what about science, what about progress, and what about me? Five years I've been working on a plan, and now over in England, they're starting to make one without me. But they're not gonna get away with it, no sir. The first ship landing on the moon is going to be designed by Gaylord Sullivan. Oh Gaylord, I do love you! Then, why are you marrying him? But I love him, too. But you can't love both of us. It just, it just isn't decent! But I do. This way is best by far, Gaylord. You see, he is richer, so I marry him, but I see you in the afternoons. It's better than marrying you and seeing him in the afternoons. But Madelaine, I've never heard such a suggestion. You've got to make up your mind. It's either him, or me. [Henri] Hey, Madelaine! [Madelaine] It is him! Yes, but who are they? Oh, they're the guard of honor for the wedding. You better make up your mind quickly. I'm not hanging around to argue. Oh, I come with you. Quick! (Gun clicking) Imbecile, you did not load it. Monseigneur, I did not know it was that kind of a wedding. (Soft cheerful music) Gaylord, it is me she loves. Bring her back! I'm sorry, Henri, I can't. I've got to go to England. Never! Musket. Henri, Henri, don't shoot! I love you! Is it true? You really love me? I will always love you, Henri, always. Oh, Madelaine! This is an inquiry about rights, and mineral deposits on the moon. File that under prospective investors. How do we find out if there's mineral up there? Well, the man who goes up will have to bring back samples. Barnum, I've opened over 2,000 letters, and I ain't found one yet from a man who wants to go there. General, I'm sure there's such a man somewhere. A man of courage, devotion, loyalty. Possibly a, uh, military man. Well, like you always say, there's one born every minute. Ah yes, well, we don't have to worry about that yet a while. I'm off to Barset House. First meeting of the committee. - Okay General? - Okay. (Cheery music) (tapping on door) Good morning, Mr. Barnum! Good morning, your grace, good morning. The others are here. Let's go and take a look. Oh, Anna, this is Mr. Barnum. Miss Anna Linstrom, my daughter's companion. - How do you do? - Charmed. (Loud banging) (crashing) Sorry, daddy. This is Mr. Barnum, my dear. My daughter, Lady Electra. Hello, Mr. Barnum. We're making a lift, daddy. Oh good! I shan't need the pickax now, Anna, I've managed without it. Right-oh. Both of them very keen on engineering, you know. I encourage them, it keeps them out of mischief. Yes. Hop on, Anna. I'll just turn on the motor. Ready, Anna? (Winch squeaking) (loud explosion) Now gentlemen, as I see it, our immediate task is divided into three sections. First, the construction of the cannon. Oh I handle this, it is already constructed. Good, splendid Professor. And secondly, the construction of the projectile. Oh, you can leave that to me, Mr. Barnum. Very good, very good, and third and lastly, the raising of the money for the project. Ah yes, that could well be the most difficult part of it. (Men murmuring) Gentlemen, gentlemen, if this committee will furnish me with the estimated cost of this project, I will raise the money. (Men chattering with approval) However, I will need an assistant to act as treasurer. Yes, and I know just the chap. Oh splendid, who is he? My brother-in law, Captain Harry Washington Smythe. No! (Wooden clatter) I beg your pardon, very silly of me. This Smythe, he is, of course, a completely reliable man? Absolutely first rate. He's a gentleman. That thing work, Grundle? Of course it will. I knows me trade, you know. I learned it out in the colonies. Yeah, we know, you laid the first cable from Botany Bay to Van Diemen's land. How does it work? Quite simple really, you know. This machine is connected to the main telegraph line. Every time a message comes through to the telegraph office, you reads it first. That way, you gets advanced information on the stocks and shares. Well, I suppose if the stock exchange can get you the telegraph, we shall have to do the same thing. Although it won't be half as much fun as intercepting carrier pigeons. (Mechanical tapping) Here, one's coming through now. Captain Sir Harry Washington Smythe, 14 Enterprise Billings, London, But that's me, what's it say? Come to Barset house immediately regarding position of Treasurer to Moonship Subscription Fund, signed Barset. What's a moonship? I don't know what a moonship is, but I know what a subscription fund is, money, come on. (Horseless carriage chugging) Who on earth's that? Miss Anna, from the look of her. From the look of her what? From the look of her, I think I better go and help her. (Tapping at door) (door opening and closing) (lips smacking) Why must we always meet like this, in secret? And as Mr. Barnum will agree, I'm sure, we mustn't leave the money idle. As it comes in, I will invest it. On behalf of the committee, of course. I know some excellent companies. Good, good, well gentlemen, do we all agree then, that Captain Smythe shall act as treasurer? [Queen Victoria] It gives us the greatest pleasure to open this new suspension bridge. (Crashing) Thank you, Sir Charles. Well fine, fine; now that's settled, Captain, would you sit here? I'll sit next to Sir Charles if I may, I've always been a great admirer of his work. Now gentlemen, I think Professor von Bulow should speak. Gentlemen, by this experiment, you'll see some of the problems which confront us. Bulovite. (Suspenseful music) Open the window, please. Watch closely. (Loud explosion) (men coughing) You see, gentlemen, the problem of recoil. Yes, amazing Professor, amazing. And that's only part of our problem. To fire a projectile beyond the pull of the earth's gravitation, it would be necessary to construct a cannon with a barrel measuring 573 feet. By using bulovite, however, I can reduce this length to 310 feet. The real problem is that it is not possible to construct a cannon of this size. The only answer, therefore, is... No. The only answer, therefore, is, to drill a hole into the side of a mountain. And use this for our cannon. Understand? Then our first task is to find a mountain. Well as a matter of fact, I can help you there. We own one. Do we Harry? Of course we do, Willie, Caer Flutie. Oh yes, of course, the estate in Wales. Yes, I forgot about that place, yes. (Girls giggling) Oh look, it's Uncle Harry's new gas carriage. Beautiful. Miss Anna? Yes? Half inch spanner. Here. (Romantic cooing) Dillworthy. Dillworthy, come back. Get away from me, Smythe. Dillworthy, I want a word with you. It's the voice of the tempter, get away from me. But Diller, old chap. Thou shalt not tempt me Smythe. The voice of the tempter is the lure of the land. The way you're shouting, at sea as well. No, Smythe, I won't do it. Whatever it is, I will not do it. But I merely wish to offer you a lift back to town, on my new gas carriage. On your new gas carriage? No, there'll be more to it than that, I know you. Well I did think we might have a chat on the way back about this moonship thing, eh? No, Smythe, no. I mean, look what happened on that Trent bridge, it collapsed, in front of her majesty. The humiliation of it! And it was all your fault. You supplied the materials. Well you took the profit, and now look who's complaining. Not very sporting. I know, but it was me that had to face the inquiry. (Gas carriage rattling) You know, Dillow, there could be 5,000 pounds in this for you. Oh stop tormenting me Smythe, get thee behind me, Satan. Possibly even seven. Oh, the flesh is weak, but every man has his price. All right, what is your price? 10. Right, 10,000 pounds the day my company gets the contract for the moonship. (Loud thumping) Oh, blast! What's the matter with the darn thing? Ran out of gas. Give us a push, will you? Come on. That's it. Right, that'll do. Now, Diller, chin up and take this along, will you? Steady, steady. Mind the paper. Right, turn it on. (Pump squeaking) You know the whole principle of this vehicle is dishonest. It relies on stolen gas. That isn't the point. It's very economical to run. (Adventurous music) Mr. Mitty has acquired this mountain from his grace, the Duke of Barset. The greatest geologists in England have pronounced it suitable for our purpose. And so gentlemen, it is from this spot, man will journey forth to his conquest of the moon. I think we should be going down now. They're ready to start blasting. - Madelaine darling? - Hm? I don't know where we are. Why don't we go down and ask somebody? Because then we wouldn't have enough gas to get back up again. I should have stayed with Henri. He would have looked after me. He's just a big, rich, stupid fool. He knows nothing. But at least he knows where he is. But he doesn't know where you are. Oh Madelaine, I wish we were on the ground. Oh! (Gas hissing) What are you doing? Going to the ground, my darling. You've let too much out! Grundle has placed the charge of bulovite all around the top, and now we shall discharge them with electricity. You see the idea, gentlemen, is to remove the top of the mountain, leaving a flat surface, into which we will dig our shaft. Is this the electric detonator, Professor? Oh no, no, no. That's my electro-magnetic speaking trumpet. Ah hah. (Loud squeaky gibberish) Hello, he's off again. (Loud squeaky gibberish) What's he saying? I don't know. He can't be using it properly. (Soft cheerful music) (basket crunching) Oh, Gaylord! Gaylord, take care! Gaylord, help! Help, Gaylord! Gaylord! [Photographer] Stand still, gentlemen. Guv'ner, all charges laid. Grundle, Grundle, you got my instructions all right? Oh yes, yes, every word. And now gentlemen, I shall remove the top of the mountain. (Suspenseful music) (crank rattling) [Gaylord] Hey there, help, help! Hey there! Stop! Thank heavens it didn't work. But it should have worked. (Loud explosion) (dramatic music) [Barnum] Are you all right? Thank you, thank you, Barnum. (Ominous music) (light cheery music) (soft musical fanfare) (knocking) Yes? Oh. Please, can you help me? Is the bridegroom with you? No, I'm all alone in a foreign country. Foreign, but not unfriendly. Do come in. Oh, thank you. Why, it's absolutely incredible! You must have been working on these plans for years. It's all I've ever dreamed about. But how on earth did you ever get here, boy? We came by balloon. The balloon, Madelaine, I forgot. (Knocking at door) [Madelaine] Yes? You'll find some clothes in there. They belong to Lady Electra. My niece, you know. Oh, thank you. What can we do to find Gaylord? Hm, what? Don't worry, I'll get my man to organize a search party. Oh, thank you. You're being very kind. Perkins, Perkins, I want you to come in here. Coming, sir. (Knocking at door) (door opening and closing) Ah, there you are Perkins. Here I be, sir. Perkins, there's a young French lady in the next room whose fiancee is lost in the hills. I want you to organize a search party and go and look for him. Yes sir, it'll be getting dark, sir. Maybe the young lady, if she wants to come along, would have to hurry. (Loud clattering) Careful, Perkins. No, that won't be necessary, she'll stay here with me. She'll be perfectly safe here with me. Oh that she will, sir, you bein' the finest and most honorable gentleman that ever did draw a breath. Oh thank you, Perkins, well off you go, take my horse, no time to lose. Aye aye, sir. (Sound of footsteps) (door opening and closing) Sent my man off. Care for a spot of supper? Oh thank you, I'm just coming. Oh dear, the door is jammed. Oh really? Well don't worry, I'll come and help you through the window. (Door opening and closing) (lock clicking) Champagne? There's no sign of her. The duke's hunting lodge, perhaps she's in there. (Madelaine screaming) (glass shattering) (crashing) Madelaine! Gentlemen of the committee, it gives me much pleasure to show you, for the first time, a scale model of my moonship. Barset, would you kindly assist me please? Well? It certainly is a handsome thing. See, I don't know very much about engineering, but... Well what did you know, Mr. Barnum? As you know, I'm just an amateur engineer. Yes I do know, Barset, extremely amateur. Yes, well it occurs to me that, if this is to be fired from a cannon, Yes, Barset? Well it seems to me these projections might prevent the air-tight fit in a cannon. Any more questions? Yes, I have a question I'd like to ask. Mr. Barnum, I can assure you that this projectile will take a man to the moon in perfect safety. Exactly sir, but how does it bring him back? I was told to design a projectile to convey a man to the moon. Nothing was said about bringing him back. But he might not like it up there. Then he'll just have to lump it then, won't he? I mean the obvious answer is to find someone who doesn't want to come back. Well I can assure you, sir, that General Tom Thumb will insist on coming back. Well then we'll just have to find someone else. Some fella at the work house, give them an ounce of backing, and a couple of shillings, he'd jump at the chance. Oh no, no, no, you can't send a man up there to his doom. Barnum and the public would never permit it. Even if he is a pauper. I take it, Sir Charles, you haven't examined this young man's design? No I have not. And I've no intention of doing so, either. I'll tell you this, it's either mine, or nothing. And you can get in touch with me when you've made up your minds. Oh dear. Gentlemen, gentlemen, let us not be too despondent. Gaylord, would you be good enough to show the gentlemen your proposal? Well yes. You see it was my idea to place rockets in the nose, so that when it landed on the moon, in this position, reverse rockets would propel it back to earth. Ha, rockets, yes of course, it's the logical answer. You idiots. This fraud could never design a moonship. He's a charlatan. Even so, Sir Charles, we are prepared to commission the design from him. And I'm afraid that your services will be no longer required. Oh, they won't, won't they? Well then, we'll see. You'll be begging for me to come back, begging. You'll see, all of you. And no pinching my design either. Hello Diller old man, anything wrong? Why weren't you there, Smythe? Why weren't you at the committee meeting? I had to fight them all on me own. No support from anyone. Anything go wrong? Everything. They pushed me off. And commissioned that damn yank! Well, I need to talk to Willie about this. Get that, yank as you say, pushed off, and you put back on again. It's the only patriotic thing to do, besides it's absolutely vital we get the contract for that moonship, vital. We have followed with great interest the progress of your moonship, Mr. Barnum. We understand that the subscription fund has now reached over a million pounds. Have you decided who will journey in it? Well ma'am, we're not releasing the news till later. But we wish to know now. It will be General Tom Thumb, ma'am. Splendid. We will send him a message wishing him Godspeed and a safe voyage. He'll appreciate that, ma'am. We have also requested our war office to give Professor von Bulow every assistance with his experiment. (Loud explosion) (heroic music) (seagulls screeching) What? On you feet, on your feet, all of you. Come on, Dawkins, you can have a nice slide down when you get to the mess. On your feet, get fell in. Class, atten-hun! Class, to the right, face. Class, atten-hut! Class, number. [Soldiers] (in turn) One, two, three, four, five, Hello, one gentleman absent. Carruthers, anybody seen Mister Carruthers? Come on, Mister Carruthers sir, at the double. We're waiting for you. I was blown up, Sergeant. Yes, but you've come down again now, haven't you? Yes, Sergeant. Then get fell in. Remember sir, you are an officer and a gentleman. When a common gunner gets blown up, he might hang about up there, but an officer hurries down and gets properly fell in. Ready to continue, sir. Now we'll try it in the gun, and see what happens. Only this time we shall double the charge. A double charge, sir, yes sir, I understand sir. Double charge, sir? That's what I said, yeah. These experiments are of vital importance to the moonship, eh? Double charge. Your pass, sir? I'm looking for Professor von Bulow. Oh him sir, yes, he's over on the north range with a class of officer cadets, just the other side of that red flag. Ah, thank you. Round home. (Ramrod scraping) And now for the bulovite. [Sergeant] The charge, Mister Hawkins. (Suspenseful music) Careful, you idiot! Sir. Right, one gentleman to volunteer to ram it home. Mister Carruthers. I did it last time, Sergeant. Yes, well you have the experience, so to speak, haven't you? Go along now. (Ramrod squeaking) (suspenseful music) What next, sir? I don't know, we never got this far before. I will examine my notes. Might I suggest the projectile, sir? The projectile, of course, that's right. Load ball. (Scary music) Gun loaded, sir. Good, good. Now all we need is the sluice juice. (Humming "Round the Mulberry Bush") - All present? - Yes, Sergeant. Shall I touch her off, sir? Huh? Oh yes, yes, yes, yes. (Electrical arcing) I'd hate to be close to that lot when it goes off. Professor, Professor von Bulow? Did you hear something, sir? Not yet. But in 20 seconds, you will hear the most beautiful sound in the world. Professor von Bulow, you there? Yeah? This blasted thing is on fire. What do you want me to do with this thing? Put it out, sir, put it out. Excellent fuse you are using. One can't put it out. Hey, this damn thing's dangerous. What do you want, Barnum, huh? You are holding up my experiment. Professor, the committee is becoming a little bit agitated. Now, you must give us precise details for the thinking of that cannon shot. Yeah, I know, I know. Fit another fuse, please. Right, at the double. We have driven in the subsidiary shaft and you see, we can't start working on the cannon shaft until you give us the precise diameter. Yes I know, but that depends on my experiments. However, I shall be finished here in one week. Come on then, watch this. No, no Professor, I must report to the committee. Come on, hurry up with that fuse... (huge explosion) (laughing) (ominous music) Magnificent! Oh there you are, Barnum. Here, read that telegram, Barnum, go on, read it. Why, it's from her majesty Queen Victoria. She wishes you every good fortune on your trip to the moon. General this is wonderful, her majesty has chosen you to travel in the moonship! But of course Barnum, you wouldn't know anything about it. Well General, I'll have to admit that I had a slight inkling that they might choose you. But this is obviously what they call a high-level decision. Well I'm making a low-level decision. I ain't going. You see Willie, I think it's a bad thing you should reject Dillworthy's design and sail with this American. If he is American. I mean for all we know he may be a spy or something. It's your shot, Harry. I see, Harry, you've potted my ball again. That's four times in four strokes. Everybody has a special shot, I happen to have mine. Not against the rules, you know. Besides, you would insist upon having a five guinea wager on the game. No I didn't, you did. Is that relevant? Jolly ball drop, you're very good, you know. Yes, well next time you do pot my ball, Harry, I shall be most annoyed. Your shot. Willie, about Dillworthy... Oh not now, Harry. I am planning a shot. There's something very peculiar about this table, Harry. What on earth? Hey, this table's magnetic. How extraordinary. What on earth could have caused it? A deliberate device to cheat! Harry, you have perverted the discoveries of science to your foul and filthy ends. If you had any spark of decency, you would go straight down to the gun room. The gun room Willie? You would lock the door. And at the sound of a shot, a housemaid would scream. And you, you Harry, would have paid for your despicable action in the only way left open for a gentleman. I say, I like the bit about the housemaid screaming. You are a cad sir. A cad and a bounder. And you are no longer welcome in my house. Furthermore, I shall recommend that your moonship accounts be audited immediately. You're perfectly welcome, Willie. You won't find anything there. (Gas carriage chugging) Die, dirty rotten spy! Who was he calling a dirty spy? I think it was me. Oh, good. (Metallic rattling) Madelaine darling, they've approved the plans and we start building it tomorrow. Oh good, and when you finish we'll go back to Paris. But you promised to stay here with me until I finish. But of course my darling. I love you. And I love you. But I also love Henri. Poor Henri, he misses me so. He says he's not going to eat anything till I come back to Paris. Ha, he'll be as skinny as a bean pole by then. How long do you stay here Gaylord? Oh I'd say about 18 months. 18 months, oh you beast! (Laughing) (explosion banging) Large charge, sir. Thank you, Sergeant, that will be all. My experiments are complete. Now we know the correct amount of bulovite to use. Thank heavens for that sir. Stretcher bearers. Even if General Tom Thumb doesn't go, it won't affect the design. I've allowed for plenty of room inside. How about the deliveries of steel plates? Just a moment. I've just received the auditor's report. Captain Smythe has embezzled over 100,000 pounds! What? How in the world could a thing like that happen? It's very complicated. Grundle did explain it to me. They tell me it's quite legal. They can't touch him. Yes and we'll make more at this party. There we are. So this is how you invested the moonship funds! Get your hands off me, how dare you! I promise you that you'll regret this. Harry, you're a traitor, a rotten stinking traitor. May I ask what you mean by that remark? You know damn well what I mean. Barnum has bribed you to put the American flag on the moon. You're a traitor. You liar! Strike me again and every patriotic Englishman here will string you up from the nearest lamppost. He's right enough there. We'd string him up as soon as look at 'im. (Crowd muttering in anger) Furthermore Willie, I'll wager you any money you like, you'll never even get that moonship off the ground. I will not demean myself by wagering with you. I will, what odds are you givin'? 50 to one, Willie, 50 to one. - 200 guineas on it... - 50 guineas! You can't back out on us. I have no intention of backing out, but let's do this thing properly. Gaylord will be surprised. Gaylord, Gaylord, look who is here! Gaylord, my old friend, how splendid to see you again. And how is your great moonship going? Henri, what are you doing here? I have come to take Madelaine back to Paris with me. We are to be married. Yes, but she's promised to stay until I have finished the moonship. Oh it is true, I promised. Monsieur Barnum, how long will it be? Well we're held up a little bit for money right now. We need another 100,000 pounds. Oh, that is no problem. Henri is the richest man in France. He owns three banks. Four. He will lend you the money. Well I'm afraid it's not quite that simple, my dear. However, it is a marvelous opportunity for a private investor. Say no more, I will let you have it. Well by George, this is splendid! We'll get together in the morning and draw up the conditions. There is only one condition. And what is that, sir? He must go up in it. [Madelaine] Oh, Gaylord! Good evening, Smythe. I hear you're taking bets, Smythe. Yes, 3,400 pounds at 50 to one. Over 150,000, I say! Is that all together wise? No, therefore, Diller, I need your expert assistance. Oh? I want you to ensure that moonship never leaves the earth. Never leaves the earth? (Laughing) What a splendid idea. When will you do it? There's no point in doing it yet, someone might find out. The time to do it is when the ship is constructed. And on view to the public. (Chuckling) Never leaves here! Champagne? You devil! (Laughing) (band music) How long will you have the moonship on display in London? Well that depends on the firing date of the rocket, which is now being determined by the Astronomer Royal. And the number of people who are willing to pay to come and see it. How many do you estimate? Oh, I would say around two million, at five shillings a head. Half a million pounds, eh? - Not bad. - Yes. Come and I'll show you around. - Morning, Mr. Barnum - Morning. Mademoiselle. Ah, shall we? There it is Dillers. Can't do anything about it yet, Smythe, too many people about. We'll have to wait until it's dark. Yes, of course. Well, I suppose we'll have to stroll around and enjoy the beauties of nature. And what are these handles for? Oh, that is the bed. - The bed? - Mm-hmm. And why do yo have a carpet on the ceiling? Because on the way down, sir, that will be the floor. What is the purpose of this epidendra? To see if the atmosphere can support plant life. - And the canary? - Bird life. This is, of course, primarily a scientific exploration, but mind you gentlemen, there may be creatures on the moon, strange creatures beyond our wildest imagination, which the public will be most anxious to see on exhibition. Chloroform. And these switches control the rocket. I fire the rocket to bring me back to earth. Oh Gaylord, you are so brave! To think you're going to go up there all by yourself! Henri, oh! What are you doing here? I have come to take Madelaine back for our wedding. Oh no, I don't go to the moon for months. And she promised. That she would stay until the moonship was completed, and now it is completed. Oh it is true, Gaylord. Oh Madelaine darling, have dinner with me tonight. It may be our last time together, on earth. Oh of course I will, Gaylord. Oh Bertram, I'm so glad the moonship is finished. Now you can stop working so hard, and spend some time with me. - Miss Anna, - Yes Bertram? There's something I'd like to ask you. Yes, Bertram? Would you come down in the bushes with me? Oh Bertram! (Giggling) Come on. Miss Anna, Miss Anna, I knows how you feels about me and, well, dare I, that is may I... Oh Miss Anna, marry me, marry me and come and live in Watling, let me take you away from all of this. Oh Bertram, I'm so fond of you, but we can never marry. Is it because of the differences in our social position? No Bertram. (Weeping) I know. It's because of the colonies. Mademoiselle, (sobbing) What is the matter? Is there anything I can do? Oh love is so cruel! (Sobbing) There, there. Now come on. Sir Percival, tell me, on what date can we fire the moonship? Well the whole thing is governed, you see, by the position of the moon shaft. Let me see now, oh yes, yes, this is it. Now, you must fire the projectile on October the 20th, at 11 minutes to four o'clock in the afternoon. But that's next Sunday. So it is, yes. No, no that's much too soon. What's the next date? The next date, yes, January the 14th. Next year? Not next year, January the 14th, 1968. But Sir Percival, there must be some mistake. Oh no, no, no, no there's no mistake. It's the position of the moon. The moon shaft, you see. The moon only comes over it once in every hundred years or so. But, next Sunday. Two million visitors at five shillings a head. Yes, well. Oh yeah, come on Diller. Give me that science journal. Taxidermy equipment. Chloroform, what would anyone want chloroform for? No idea, now, according to this, the equipment is kept down here. And this is the living quarters. The control room must be, up here. Come on. What are you looking for? The rocket firing equipment. Is that it? Yes, well done, Smythe, well done. What will that do? I'll tell you, when the moonship is fired, the rockets will fire at the same time. Now, the two pressures will equalize each other, and squash the whole thing flat like a six penny piece, unless of course, it explodes. (Chuckling) (distant clattering) [Harry] It's Madelaine. How nice to see you again, my dear. I heard what you said. You're going to blow up Gaylord. You murderers! Murderers! No, no, we were only joking, weren't we? [Madelaine] No you were not, you're going to blow it up. You want to kill him. [Sir Charles] No, no no, you must have misunderstood. [Madelaine] You won't touch me first, you murderer! My dear girl, I can assure you that I've no intention whatsoever of harming you. But I have. What is this place, Smythe? [Harry] Run by an old friend of mine. Now you understand, I will not allow this girl to be harmed in any way. Oh shut up. Well I mean it. (Muffled piano music) (female voices chattering) Sounds like a party. Wait for us down there. (Bell ringing) ♪ All things bright and beautiful I don't like the look of this place Smythe, I don't like the look of it at all. ♪ All things great and small ♪ All things wise and wonderful ♪ Ho ho, it's Captain Smythe, hmm. All right, girls. We thought it might be one of the governors. - Sir Charles Dillworthy. - Evening. Pick her up, sir. Bring her into the warmth. Oh what poor creature of the night have you brought us, Captain? What poor lamb, who strays apart from the flock? We found her in the gutter, unconscious. We fear she might have been drinking. Drinking, dreadful. Put her down, gently. (Girls whispering) We feel that we may have saved her from a fate worse than, um, Worse than death? So I'm told. Oh, it is Smythe, it is undoubtedly. How the blazes would you know, Dillworthy? I trust that she'll be quite safe here. Oh absolutely safe. We feel that she may well attempt to escape back to... The life from which you saved her. Yes exactly, I therefore look to you to... Forestall such a wicked and ungrateful act. Precisely. Very well gentlemen, if there is no alternative, I will agree. Good, good. Tomorrow we will transport the moonship to Wales, and Sunday we will send it on its way. (Crowd cheering) (adventurous music) (steam tractor chugging) Good luck, Mister Barnum! (Crowd shouting encouragement) Thank you very much. What's the matter young man, worried about going up? It's not just that, it's Madelaine. To think that she would go away with Henri now, without saying goodbye. Hey, guv'ner, look. Oh the moonship is coming! The moonship is coming! (Laughing) (steam tractor whistling) Gentlemen, three cheers, hip hip, [All] Hooray! - Hip hip, - Hooray! - Hip hip, - Hooray! (Steam engine wheezing and clattering) (all cheering) Thank you. Well, here's to Sunday and a successful launching. I hear there's a whisper, her majesty may decorate you tomorrow, before you go. I'm deeply honored. But why doesn't she give it to me on my return, isn't that the usual thing? Of course I'm, I'm not normally a drinking man, you understand that. Oh, thank you very much indeed. Sometimes one wants to drown one's sorrows. I've never told anybody about this before, you realize that. You mean, you were actually transported to the colonies as a convict? Mm. But how jolly exciting. What did you do? 15 years. No, I mean, why were you sent there? I stole a sticky bun. Yeah, you see I was starving, so I nicked this here sticky bun. Oh Grundle. 15 years for a sticky bun. Oh Grundle, what beastly hard luck. Yeah, oh my dear, shocking it is. But even worse, it's been a barrier between me and the one what I loves. Oh Grundle, have you told her of your feelings? It's no good milady, I aspires to Annie. Our social differences is too great. Oh Grundle, dear Grundle, of course marriage is out of the question, but true love knows no social barriers. Providing of course, one is discreet. (Giggling) Yes, it's Miss Anna, with that Henri fellow. Mademoiselle Anna has consented to be my wife. Your wife, are you some kind of a Blue Beard? What have you done with Madelaine? What have you done with her? I have not seen her for nearly a week. Well, she gonna keep doing this to me, I am having Miss Anna. You can keep your Madelaine. Then where is Madelaine? How should I know? Look, one of the bars is loose. We can escape. You could be free. What, free to work in a rotten pickle factory at half a crown a week, no thank you. Look duck, you'll settle down when you've been here for a bit. Now then girls, time for a nightcap. Tea, coffee, cocoa, or hot milk. Ain't you got no gin, matron? Not for the junior girls, only for the seniors. Oh now Madelaine, we're not still sulking for the outside world, are we? Why can't I make you understand, while I'm prisoner here, they're trying to kill Gaylord. He will be killed the moment they fire the moonship. But you're not a prisoner dear. Then why have you got bars on the windows? They're not to keep us in, they're to keep the gentlemen out. (Soft, stealthy music) (window squeaking) Oh! If you make me come back, I'll tell. Goodnight, Jack. (Window rattling) Now, try jumping up and down, old chap. Comfortable? Oh splendid, old chap. Well take off that moon hat. Oh by the way, when you get to the moon, don't jump too vigorously, you could fly off the surface. Now let's try out the launching bed. There we are. That's jolly good. Right, now lower the weights. Can you move? Oh no. Splendid, splendid, splendid. Tell me, your grace, what's all of this all about? Oh it's just a little invention of mine, to make him secure during the launching. Well how does he get out from under there with all these heavy weights around? Oh it's quite simple. When the moonship leaves the earth's gravity, the whole thing becomes weightless, it just floats up obviously. Can you reach the launching lever? Oh yes. How much further, Smythe? Not far now, capsule will be just ahead. I don't know why we had to come here in the first place. You know, I don't want to see the lad killed. You're a ghoul, Smythe, a ghoul. Not entirely. I merely want you to go inside the moonship and make quite certain they haven't discovered any of your careful little adjustments. Oh. Barnum. I'm Colonel Scuttling of Scotland Yard. May I have a word with you? Why certainly sir, what is it? Shh, not here. Mr. Barnum, we have received information that there may be an agent of the Czar in the vicinity. We believe that this agent may try to sabotage the moonship. Great thundering buffaloes, what can we do? I have mounted patrols guarding the countryside. Have your fellows keep a strict guard on the ship. Certainly, Colonel. (Sniffing) (suspenseful music) (hooves clattering) (steam engine huffing and rattling) It's the police, man. - What? - The police! Well what about them? We're exceeding the speed limit for a mechanically propelled vehicle. Oh, have I? You're doing nine miles an hour. Am I really? Will you stop! They're closing in on us, Smythe. Right Smythe, four miles an hour, if you please. (Hooves clattering) - Just a minute, sir. - Yes? We're looking for an agent of the Czar. Have you seen any suspicious persons? What does he look like? Foreign looking, dressed in black with a tall hat. Who are you? I am Sir Charles Dillworthy, British and proud of it. Sorry sir. You damn sod. Come on. Hey, why are we stopped, we late already. The Rhodes train stopped at the station ahead, we have to wait for it to pull out. Is this Caer Flutie? [Conductor] Yeah. Hey, you can't do that, Miss, hey! (Gas carriage puffing and back-firing) Put a block under the back wheel. Ran out of gas. No gaslamps anywhere, Smythe. We're stuck. We're jolly well not. ♪ With the dawn we'll trust the stranger ♪ We must send him on his way (banging at door) Gas company sir, checking the pressure. On a Sunday? I don't want to alarm the family sir, but we've had a lot of explosions. Oh, heavens preserve us, do come in. Thank you, sir. How do you do. Thank you. How long will it take? Oh, just a jiffy. Pump! Oh the humiliation. (Pump whooshing) Well do carry on. ♪ With the dawn we'll trust the stranger ♪ We must send him on his way ♪ We must always try to give a helping hand ♪ A helping hand ♪ We must shelter him from danger ♪ And the spirit of the love he'll understand ♪ He'll understand ♪ If you see that little chapel on the wayside (wooden knocking) ♪ The love you can (knocking at door) ♪ You must ever have an open invitation ♪ Shun ♪ Oh please, can you help me? I must get to the moonship, they're trying to blow it up. The moonship, heaven preserve us, come in. Thank you. Stop, stop, this young woman says they are trying to blow up the moonship. Oh she does, does she? (Dramatic music) - Lift it. - Whaddya mean lift, oh! It's that Madelaine, she's escaped, come on! Get in. (Crashing) We're pulling something, Smythe. Oh shut up. (Crashing) Can't you go any faster? (Glass shattering) (loud splashing) Come on, faster you bugger! Dillworthy, Dillworthy! (Water splashing) I'm sorry, Smythe, I lost my temper, I deeply apologize. Yes Dillworthy, you'll have to watch that temper of yours, it'll get you into trouble one of these days. We're in trouble now. We've lost her. We're done for, Smythe, we're done for. No we're not, come on. I'm looking for Barnum. There he is, he's over there. Ah, Barnum! Her Majesty on time, she'll be here in five minutes. Well I wish von Bulow was on time, he's still preparing the charge. 491. Oh, there's one barrel short. [Sergeant] I shouldn't think one barrel would made much difference with her sir. How do we detonate it, Sarge? We don't detonate it lads. The moonship is dropped from the top of the shaft up there. It lands on the bulovite down here, causing explosions, which launches it up again. Hurry up with that last barrel. (Lout clattering) (fast, scary music) (barrel thumping) Stretcher bearers! (Suspenseful music) I would not have this girl harmed, Smythe. This won't harm her, it'll just stun her a bit. Come on, Dillworthy, help me with this rock. Oh, all right. - Smythe! - What? (Hooves clattering) You'll never stun that lot, Smythe. She's told them Smythe, we're finished, we're finished! We're not, come on. As the first person to attempt an astronautical voyage from the earth to the moon, we award you this decoration, and wish you bon voyage. Oh, and a safe return. (Loud sneeze) The moonship will be launched in six minutes time, six minutes. Tell Colonel Scuttling we've found the agent of the Czar. You're mad, you're all mad! I'm French, Francaise! And to you, Professor von Bulow... Oh it's not me ma'am, it's him. Oh dear. Oh dear, are you unwell too? As well as can be expected, ma'am, after serving you for 15 years in the colonies. I thought you looked like an old soldier. [Announcer] The moonship will be launched in four minutes time, four minutes. This is the young lady, Colonel. You must let me go, he will be killed I tell you. Do you admit that you are an agent of the Czar? No, of course not! Bring the young lady a chair, Sergeant. Yes sir. This may take some time. [Announcer] The moonship will be launched in two minutes time, two minutes. Good luck, my boy. Thank you very much, sir. I usually have quite a lot to say, but upon this occasion I can only think of one thing young man, good luck. Thank you very much, sir. [Crowd] Good luck, good luck, sir. (Sneezing) So you claim to be French, eh? Very well, (speaking French) - What? - Ah hah! You don't understand me, do you? I don't understand any of you! You're all mad! [Announcer] The moon ship will be launched in one minute's time. She couldn't have told them. 30 seconds to go. (Sneezing) It's all right. 20 seconds. I heard them say it, it will blow up when he pulls the lever, please, please. 15 seconds. Let's go! Don't fire the moonship! Don't fire the moonship! - Let me go! - 10 seconds. Nine eight seven six five four three two one second. (Crowd chattering) What's happening? Has something gone wrong? Who are you? An agent of the Czar. Oh I forgot, I'm not supposed to tell. Chloroform, it must have leaked. Thank heavens. Stand by to take him out. Something wrong, they're bringing him out. Do you know something, we've won, Smythe. We've won! He's unconscious, they'll never get it off the ground now. He might recover, come on. [Phineas] Put him down, I said put him down. That's right, put him down. Get the doctor, we must revive him. No, he can't go up, it's sabotaged. Well maybe he has the time to think this, come here. Precious moonship fini. Yes, it'll never get up, and it can't get back. (Thunderous rumbling) Great balls a-fire, it's dropped! Smythe, what have you done? You bungling idiot. Down everybody! Down everybody, quickly! Your Majesty. (Ear-splitting explosions) We have succeed, congratulations sir. Gone, and not a soul on board. 10 million dollars wasted. Hey! (Rumbling) (screaming) It's coal, Barnum, it's coal, I'm rich! We're rich. You sold the site to the committee, we're rich. All right, we are rich. We'll have enough money to build another moonship. Yeah, yes! I blame you for this, Dillworthy. Because of your stupid bungling, we're doomed to spend the rest of our days with these filthy moon men. I tell you we're not on the moon, we're in Russia. Probably Siberia. Nonsense, we are on the moon. I tell you we're not. Everybody happy? Everybody sing! (Whip cracking) ♪ Heave ho, heave ho ♪ (singing in Russian) There you are Smythe, if we're on the moon, why are they singing Russian songs? It simply means, Dillworthy, that the Russians got here first. - Dillworthy? - What? [Harry] Dillworthy, I have an idea. [Charles] No Smythe, I won't listen. I'll tell you something, you'll get shot here. Seriously shot. (Cheerful waltz music) (lion roaring)
