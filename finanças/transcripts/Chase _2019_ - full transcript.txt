Hey, Chase, let me tell you something, man. When I got out of the shower tonight, I used a product I have never used before called Gold's Dawn Medicated Body Rub. It feels like my entire ass crack is smoking a Newport! I think I hear it cracking right now! Man, my dick and nuts are starring, and it's on your Peppermint Patty commercial. - Oh, Jesus Christ! - Nah, I tell you, kid, whoo-ah, I don't get no respect at all. My dick's so small, I can piss on my balls. Whoa! Turn the subways, Kevin! Whoo-ah. Whoo-ah. Now we're back to Al Pacino again. We're back to Al Pacino, baby. Of course, Denzel Washington, Al Pacino, whatever it is. Jesus Christ! Listen, I get in a three-finger stance, and blitz a fat bitch and fuck the hell outta her, man. You ever fucked a fat broad? Jesus Christ! - It smelled like... - As fat as you, or? - Shit, fatter. - Fatter? - Fatter! - Fatter than you? I love pussy that smell like day-old deli, nigga. How did you get them upstairs? Easy! I lured them with chicken nuggets. Yo, you remember that time we went to Cabo, man, for the weekend, and we got fucking annihilated? We ended up fucking that entire village. Dude, that was fucking awesome. Yeah, because you guys were in trouble, that's why. - Yeah, you know... - As always, right? You know how we roll, man. Dude, have some more drink, baby! I'm trying to drink, but you're like continuously talking - about black lives, blue lives, - Hey, listen... white lives, Chinese lives... You supply these great fucking cigars, man. I'm on a natural fucking high, man. Of all the years I've been knowing you, I've always wanted to ask, you've ever been with a Black woman? I plead the fifth, my friend, I plead the fifth! Hey, listen, man, I can't tell you how many times I've snuck into your house and watched you sleep. Aw, it's so cute when you wear the pillow - between your legs. - What? Jesus! How many times I wanted to spoon you in the middle of the night. - Oh, god! - I think, here, - this is dawg, and then... - That's... I think, I think... You should have some more. Friendship. "A state of mutual trust and support between two people." According to the dictionary. You're not listening to me, brother. I told you a thousand times. You gotta take 'em to a public place. If she doesn't look good, you're just gonna walk around a little bit. Don't go in anywhere, 'cause you gonna have to end up spending a lot of money. I don't know! Give it 30 or 40 minutes. Come up with an excuse. Something like, I don't know, you have to work in the morning, your dog is sick or something like that. If you're stupid horny, obviously, you start at your place, bag it and fuck. I mean, it's kinda simple, really. if you think about it. You're not listening. I told you a thousand times, man. You gotta keep looking at those pictures a little longer. Don't swipe so goddamn fast. Hey, listen, uh... Let me call you back in a bit, okay? Hey. - C? - Yeah. I thought you'd be taller. Is that a problem? No, I just figured you'd be a little more... seasoned, that's all. Well, I figured you being something other than a Payless fucking suit two sizes too small. Are we gonna have this conversation like this, or you're gonna invite me in? Oh, no, sorry. Please. Please come in. Sparkle, quiet! Uh, sorry about the, the mess. Why don't you... Yeah. Yeah, have a seat. You're not allergic to dogs, are you? I'm fine. Your dog's name is Sparkle? Yeah. She's a real sweetheart. Hey. Shut up, you bitch. Uh, so, can I get you something? Coffee, water... I'm good. Okay. Uh, I'm a little nervous. Hey, hey, hey, just relax, okay? Take a deep breath. Yeah? All right? Let's get this done quickly here, okay? A little tip for the road. Take out the trash, clean up the plates, and get some fucking air freshener. 'Cause it smells like four-day-old horseshit in here. Yeah, I know, I know. I had to take out a couple of extra... Hey! I don't care, okay? Get the money, show it to me in full, or I'm walking. Let's keep this professional, shall we? Look, I, I got it. All of it. Well, it shouldn't be a problem showing it to me, then. I just thought it'd be half at first. All right, listen. You listening? You listening to me? - Yeah. - You're looking at me, right? Yeah? Okay, good. I don't fucking care what you think. I want you to show me the money in full in about 11 seconds. Or I'm gonna spray a masterpiece of your fucking brains on this wall over there. - You got that? - Yeah. - Capisce? - Yeah, okay, okay. No problem, just give me a minute then. I got it all. Fucking bullshit. Hm. I, I got it, all of it. Take it out, skim through it. Hey, uh... Aren't you gonna count it? It's about right for the amount. Put it on the table. - All right. - And sit down. Right. Uh, say, can I ask you a question without you getting upset? Sure. Why do you get all of it right away... when you haven't even done it yet? Because I'm not coming fucking back here, am I? I take it, get it done, and that's that. How do I know you're not gonna just, take it and not do it? Remind me. You and Slider are linked to this, correct? - Yeah. Slider. - Yeah. You know how he got his name? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. So why on earth would I fucking blow you over? - Good point. - Yeah, it's a good point. Yeah. Hey. Told you over the phone, I have very few rules. Set my base price. Double for women, triple for kids. But I get it done. Meet in person one time, and that's it. I collect up front, and you never contact me again. I don't do repeat customers, so you choose wisely. Might do your dog in for free, though. Oh, how I do know when you got it done? Just watch the fucking news. You'll see. Yeah, oh... It's okay, Sparkle. You're taught your whole life to be passionate about what you love to do. That if you give it your all, or believe in it, you'll be the best. Well, I say, stick that up your ass. What you need to do is find something you're naturally good at, then don't care about it. I'm talking literally, not give a fuck. Think of it this way. If you're too in your head while fucking somebody, you don't perform as well, right? Well same thing to your craft. You worry so much about performing, that of course, you fuck it up. It needs to be effortless. Seamless. You can't think about who they are. Do they have kids? Maybe they're a good person. None of that bullshit. Get paid... ...get it done, and move on. There are only two people I really care about. I guess you can call that the chink in my armor. They're also the two people that ever made me feel anything. So I kept them around. Oh, my god. Don't scare me like that. Blair is a lot like me in all the worst ways. Oh, oh, I see. Just a slightly better version. Micah is nothing like me... ...and I want to keep it that way. Where's Mommy? I told myself after that, my only rule was never to orphan a kid. I'm open to anything else, but... that look Micah gave me and the first time I saw him, will always haunt me. Now, before you think I'm a total piece of shit, I actually provide for them pretty well. I take the little of what I need and give them the rest. I never thought of myself as a family man, much less a father, but... I guess the chips fell where they did. They're my only liability. The only thing I like more than my work. I could go to any meeting and feel in control. But there's only one person that tried to upstage me every time. The only other person you could say I care anything about... is Miles. Shit! Come on C, Come on, C. I met Miles in foster care and he helped me leave with him at 15. Unlike me... Miles always knew what he wanted to do. And it was nothing legal. We were always competitive with everything that we did. We knew each other's strengths, weaknesses, and how to exploit them. Miles got pleasure out of cerebrally mind-fucking anybody. He reinvented both of us, and we never looked back. He was precise about it all. Even to this day, I... I don't even know what his real name is. He gave me the name Chase when we were kids. Then he wanted to be Miles. Always running, both of us. Miles was an ace at everything he did, except for women. He's either really bad with them or just doesn't care. That's why I try to give him advice, and then when I can, but, with him... ...he tries to give me advice on everything else. If you think I didn't give a shit about anything, Miles really doesn't give a fuck. When I'm not getting referrals on my own, Miles finds me work on hits. We're a well-worked machine. There's only one thing that torches his balls about me, and he brings it up every time we meet. Oh, look at this shit. - 'Sup? - Brother's on time, but the white boy late. Welcome to the party, son. You know, during the Obama administration, tardiness was a big no-no. This Trump shit got you fucked up, man. Hey, look, word to the wise, in the future, if you want me to sit and wait around for you forever, man, don't pick a spot in the fucking Valley, man. Look around. I'm the only nigga in here. Jesus, fucking crybaby, man. Stop sending me to fucking Chink town, then. How about that, huh? Every time I go down to that fucking shit hole it's like, they're still recovering from Nagasaki. You racist-ass white boy. Shit, you got paid, though, didn't you? What difference does it make where the place is from? At the end of the day, paper is paper, right? Paper is paper. Look, have I ever steered you wrong with one of my leads, man? I can think of a couple of times. Oh, you gonna bring that shit up? Yeah. Well, you were gonna bring it up anyway, right? Thought I beat you to it. Look, man, the only reason why it was a problem is because you made it your business. Come on, man, don't get mad at me 'cause you caught feelings, nigga. Ah. Fuck, man. Let's not fucking talk about this shit, okay? No, no. We gonna talk about this. Because up to this point, you've been ice-cold about everything but this. So, what that says to me is that, obviously, there's another chink in your armor. Besides the fact that you let two motherfuckers in that you're not even supposed to give a fuck about. Well, they shouldn't concern you. - It's never affected my work. - Well, what if it does? I don't want you going soft on me, man. I don't ever want you to go soft on me. Ever! I don't give a fuck if it's from two years ago, you go soft on me, I'm gonna make sure, Chase, and I'd do everything in my power... What? You're gonna doing fucking what? Are you guys ready to order or do you need a minute? Two minutes. Two minutes. That's a bad bitch right there. Look, Chase, you're my man, 50 grand and all. Official tissue, baby. I ain't managed nobody better. But don't go thinking for one fucking second, that nothing is irreplaceable. You heard me? What are you trying to say, Miles? There it is. See? There it is. That coal in your eyes, that ice in your veins. Keep that shit. Don't ever let that go, man! What makes you think I am? Look, just let me finish. Remember what I told you? You know how motherfuckers end up done in this business? They get emotional. Whether it was pride, or just, straight out giving a fuck. It's what deads 'em. Do you wanna go to prison? Huh? You wanna end up some fuck buddy? You wanna die, Chase? Look, I suggest you remove that fucking conscience. Whatever else you got going on in your head, put it to bed. And if you do that shit, well, you know... zero slippage, man. One more fucking minute, please! Great. How about this? You stop telling me how to do my fucking job, and I stop giving you advice on how to avoid porkers and chicks with dicks. How does that sound? Huh? Aah, motherfucker! Got me feeling like Denzel in Training Day. Hey. Hey, Chase. Miles always brought up that vulnerable shit to me. But I think this time, something stuck with him. Through the laughter and joking, something had laden me, as well. I might not have known it, but... from that point on, Miles didn't trust me. I'll give you the finger! So, we're just gonna have to, have you sign a few pages here. After Blair's dad passed away a couple of years back, she inherited a good amount of money. At least enough to get her by. Now, I know you're asking yourself, why the fuck would I keep doing what I'm doing if Blair is already set? The point is, it's my passion. You can't quit that shit easily if you enjoy doing it. Care or not care, I'm good at what I do. And when you're good at something, you keep doing it. For validation, for respect. Blair's passion was painting. Anything artistic, she owned it. When she's not taking care of Micah, or me, for that matter, she's in her studio. For me, I couldn't tell a fucking Van Gogh from a Van Damme. But she's recently been teaching Micah a thing or two about it. Which I dig. - Hey, champ. - Hey. To be honest, it's getting harder and harder to come home for them after a day's work. And maybe Miles was right. He saw something in me changing. See... ...Blair knows a little of what I do, but, not everything. She's actually cool with it. 'Cause she thinks, first, everybody I do are bad, and second, that I'm distancing myself from Miles. Let's just say the contempt between them is pretty mutual. They only met a handful of times since I've been with Blair, but... that was enough, and they both have their reasons for hating each other. - Whatcha got there? - Mmm. Oh, my god, it's done. - Oh, my god, I love that. - What do you think? - Yeah? - I mean, you truly captured my true form here, huh? The next time I need an ego boost, I... I won't look in the mirror, I'll look straight at this. I think you're better in person. You think so? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you're definitely the winner. - Oh. - Mm-hm. I'm glad you liked it. - Where are you going? - Hey. Hmm? Ow! - That's cheating! - Hey, it works. Mmm, you make noises like that, you tempt me into a good time. Oh, babe, you can't say that while I'm... What are you doing? You know I wanna distract you, don't you? Thought you were ice-cold? See, nothing can phase you. Nothing! - Who is that? - Just let it ring. Just ignore it. You know, for someone so clever, you really don't think I know who M is? See, this is why I don't like you down here when I'm working out. What does that have to do with anything? Why is that dickbag calling you? I thought you said you were cutting ties with him and doing your own thing? It's not my fault he's calling me. Well, I thought you said you were meeting up with him to tell him off? What happened to that? Look, it's not easy cutting ties with somebody you've known since you were 15, okay? I know Miles can be tough, but the guy has looked out for me since day one. And never fucked me over, not once. Whatever my issues with him are, I... You guys were tight for a long time. Wait, but you said it yourself. The past few years, you have felt chained to a set of rules and circumstances. See, regardless of even meeting me, and bringing Micah along, what's the end goal here? We don't need him, Chase. You are too good at what you do to be pegged in or limited. I know he sees me as a divider, but what I'm trying to do, is release you. It's not all like that, though. I mean, his tough set of rules have kept me alive this long. I think you're just tricking yourself into thinking that. Well, how would you know? You don't know the sacrifices he made to get me through this shit. Okay, you're right, I don't know it all. So why don't you let me in a little bit? This whole thing has been brewing for a while, and I feel like I'm stuck in the fucking middle. You know, if it was just me, and you drove me to the edge, I could just leave. But we got a kid involved, Chase. That's our priority. Yeah, I'll tell you that much. I mean, the last time I met with him... ...something was off. What do you mean? I don't know. I mean, it was nothing obvious. It's just we talked about the same shit we always talk about, but... I just felt something like... he looked at me differently. How? Well... you know how I always tell you Miles has the best poker face I've ever seen? I think he picked up on me, either being late, or bringing you and Micah up first. But... Why would you do that? I mean, he always brings you guys up, one way or another. I mean, he always usually jokes about it, but... it's the seriousness about it. Like he's trying to... peel back my eyes and get into my head, make sure to leave you guys. So, why bring it up first? And why be late? You're never late? I know. That's what's fucking with me right now. I guess that's what they mean by leaving breadcrumbs. What do you mean? Well, maybe I want him to know something. That things are changing. You need to let him go. He's a sociopath, and a master manipulator. He can't do what you do, so he uses you like a pawn. Like, why do you have it out for him so much? Have I ever asked you to stop with what you're doing? - Have I? - No. Do I ever ask you any specific questions? - No. - Okay, so trust me, like I trust you. Miles is no good to you. He may have helped you in the past, but now, he is dragging you. I know how you feel, because you bring him home from work with you every night. He prefer you stay the cold machine you were when I first met you. Easier for him to control. You know why he doesn't like me? Because I've helped thaw you the fuck out. Bet if it was up to him, he'd have me doing kids, the elderly saints, anybody, without any remorse. Hey. You get rid of the bad, baby. And I know a lot of women would think I'm nuts for rationalizing it that way, but I see the good in it. Hey, you're a cleaner. Let's talk about this some other time, okay? I mean I'm not deflecting, I promise we'll talk about it, but let's just sleep over it. Let's get you cleaned up, anyway. I could use it, huh? Yeah, I think it's shower time for both of us. Well, let's do it. Oh, I love you, baby. I love you, too. Fuck! I told you, Miles! Didn't I tell you? I fucking knew it. We gotta respond. You heard them. I swear to god. If we had put bugs in any other room in that house, we would have found this out months ago. They never gave a fuck about your interest at all, neither of them. Look. Just let me do him. Let me do both of them. Fuck, I'll even add the kid. Stop, Miles! What the fuck is wrong with you? You know you didn't have to fucking do that. Hey, Burke, Control your bitch, nigga. Bitch nigga! I think now that I got y'all's fucking attention... Can I have the floor? You really didn't need to do that. Hey, stop, okay? Hey. Man the fuck up! Oh, fuck. See, I'm an equal opportunity employer. See, the same beautiful gesture I just gave your man Burke here, I can give to you, Lola. I don't give a fuck if you are a part of the pussy species. Yeah, noted. Look... I know how bad both of y'all wanna handle it. But I'm gonna tell y'all how I wanna handle it. Chase is not to be touched. At all! But, Miles, why would... Hey! Hey! Hey! You look like you still got one good hand that's begging to be fucked with. What you want is smoke. Good. Look, I've been knowing Chase since forever. Longer than I've known you two. I know what I heard, I know what we heard. But I'm telling you, that's not Chase. What do you mean that's not him? Yeah, we all fucking heard him, we know what he sounds like. Lola, check your man before he checks himself out! Burke, just shut the fuck up, all right? Just shut up. Look, I've been fucking with Chase since forever, I validate the man. Shit. I've always respected him and I've never had to stop him. Yeah, we break each other's balls sometimes, but shit, that's par for the course. As far as the game go... ...that motherfucker is a maverick. Miles, I mean this with total respect. I get it, C has been down. But I'm the only female here, I have to say it, the bitch is fucking with his head. - You see that, right? - Yeah, I know. First time he told me about her, I knew it. That bitch put life in his eyes. She makes him happy. Fuck that. Look. Before I can't get treated or I pass out, I'd just like to know, what are we gonna do about it? Yeah, since we can't touch him, what's the plan? Since you have it all figured out. Huh, Miles? I never could sleep really well. Blair's advice to falling asleep wasn't any of that counting sheep bullshit. She said to close your eyes, and imagine Micah on your shoulders, and you carrying him. She said to get a rhythm going. Imagine Micah putting his hands over your eyes and you beginning to walk backwards, completely blind, and trusting Micah with each step. A slow pacing of each step, backwards and focusing on that, while my son shades me from the world was the way it would work. I always loved the image, but to this day, it hasn't. Yo, what's up? You ready for the big one, C? Miles never gave me a hit like this last minute. So I already knew something was up. What do I care, though? He'd always pull through for me and the money was good. It would be a rush like none other every time he would give me an assignment. I can't explain it. But my body goes into another mode. Always ready. Just keep looking, man, just keep looking. Uh, you go high, I'll go low. Probably not gonna find it up here. Let's just get the fuck out of here. Dude, get the fuck outta here, come on. I need a fucking drink. When are they gonna be home? Dude, no one's been home for a week, let's go. What, you a fucking troll? What the fuck? No! C'mon babe, pick up! Pick up! Pick up! Pick up! Pick up! C'mon! Blair! Babe, listen, call me back as soon as you get this message, all right? I'm on my way back home right now, I'll explain everything when I get there. Just, call me as soon as you can, all right? Fuck! Blair? Baby? Blair? - Fuck! - Chase. Baby? Okay, come here, come here. Sit up slowly, slow, slow, slow. Take it easy. Easy, easy, easy. Take it easy. Let me have a look. Let me have a look. Oh, fuck. I gotta get you to a hospital, baby. - What happened? What happened? - They... - They... - What? Huh? Micah... They took Micah. I never did hospitals too well. Not that I didn't have the right ID's and papers to keep my nose clean. I just never had a reason to be here. Professionally, I never left anybody injured. If anything happened to me personally, I... this would be the last place I'd go. You can come back and see her now. I guess Blair was that one exception for me being here. The sympathy card came through for me. I'd rather be hunting all of them down right now, than playing husband. But in this case, I needed answers, and fast. You look worse than I do. Babe, you know I'm gonna ask you, right? And we don't have much time. And it's only gonna help get me to Micah faster, all right? You're gonna have to tell me everything. There were two of them. It all happened so fast. Did you see what they looked like? I was half asleep when they came in. I was totally disoriented. They, they rushed me, and they, they pointed my head down and they told me that they'd kill me if I looked up at them. Did you recognize their voices? I mean, anything? Did it sound like Miles? You really think he would do something like this? I wouldn't have thought so before, but... all options are on the table now. Did either of them sound like him? No, it was a man and a woman, I think. That's what it sounded like. The guy pinned me down, and he pushed my face to the side so I couldn't look straight up at him. I clocked the fucker in the face once, but he only pinned me down harder. Gave me a couple of cracks to knock me out. All I remember is the other one just kept laughing the whole time while he did it. And then they stormed out and I heard a door open. And I heard murmured screams... from Micah getting dragged out. I tried my hardest, I tried to crawl out there, and I tried to do something, but I was too weak, and then you came. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay. You don't have to go on, okay? I got everything I need. No one's gonna hurt you anymore. No one, you got that? I'm gonna take care of this. I need you to do two things for me. What? First, I need you to find Micah. And then I need you to kill them. All of them. Done. I'm gonna be back in a little bit to check on you, all right? Just don't tell the cops anything. Nothing, all right? Make up something about the bruises, all right? - Yeah? - Okay. I'm on it. - I love you. - I love you, too. It'll be over before you know it. I guess more of me rubbed off on Blair than I thought. She wanted all of them killed. No long drawn out justice, just did in. Now most people would just want to cut the head off, 'cause that's where the source is, and it would end. But I'm going for all of the limbs, every last one. And I know exactly where to start. You ready for this? - Ready? - Yeah! Get the fuck outta here! Hey, you won! This is funny... - Hey! Hey! Hey! - What? Don't touch my fucking chips, man. You see that guy? He's a cheap ass fucking guy. Hey, man, I need, I need some chips. - Que la verga, ey! - I won, I won anyway. Fucking two pair. What's up? What's up, bitches! Two pair? No, no, no. - You lose! - Ah! Do you see these cards? - You be cheating, Hector. - Get outta here. I got something better, Hector. Whatcha got? Whatcha got? - Where is it? - Well, watch this. - Flush, what's up? - That's not bad. - That's not bad. - Whatcha got, Burke? It's all right. Hey, you ready for this? - Are you ready for this? - What's up, Burke? Full House, bitches. You're all fucking cheating. Hey, Franco, can you go get some beers? Hey, hey, hey. Franco, Franco, before you go, man. - What's up? - Be fucking honest with me. Does Burke look like a girl to you? Of course, he does. Look at him. Oh, yeah, shopping at Baby Gap. - Get the fuck outta here! - Good one, Franco. Oh! It's party time. Hey, Burke! Hey, Burke! Your little sister called, she wants her shirt. What's wrong with my shirt? It looks like my shirt, you're fucking stealing my shit! I was about to say that, Jess. It doesn't fit you, so it's clearly mine. Oh, fuck you, guys. Besides, it doesn't matter. Because look at this excessive injury. Who stabbed you, Burke? Who stabbed you, man? You know what, Burke, use your other hand and start jerking off like you always do. - Yeah! - Fuck you, guys. Who needs it anyways? Lola got me. - Sure! - Oh, sure! - Right! - Yeah. You know what, every time we see you, you're more fucked up. - What is this? - Hey. Hey, hey. - What is this shit? - Watch it, watch it, it's liability, it's the job. What... why, when Lola comes around and she don't look like that, you do? - Right. - She's kicking your ass! Yeah, you know what, Burke? your girl got her shit together more than you. Hey, you know what? Fuck all, y'all, like, these are battle wounds, bitches, - where's yours at? - Battles? Ah, we know how to do our job. - That's right. - No one else got 'em. No battle wounds on us, except this battle wound. Hey, you know what, I gotta use the shitter. Fuck! We're in the middle of a hand. What? I gotta take a shit, man, sorry. No wonder you smell like shit, bro. Que la chingada, cabron! Watch that man, jigsaw. Don't make a fucking mess in there. - Fuck you! - The only one with a mess, is you. Look at this shit. Oh, fuck! Damn it! No, No, No. Burke, Jessie, fuck the bullshit. I'm going in, you know what? 'Cause I gotta fucking piss. And Hector's taking too much of a long shit. Brilliant play, you know. And did you even see what that guy ate? - Who? Shithead? - Yeah. No. I feel sorry for that toilet, though. - Bruh! - I'll have you clean it, cabron. Cabrón. Cabrón. Fucking white boy. What's the difference? Oh, my god. "What's the difference?" Yo, Hector, what are you doing to my shitter, man? - Well, go help him. - You go check it out. Dude, what the fuck, man? What, why me, puto? 'Cause you're the first one who brought it up. - Well get up, puto! - Fuck you, Burke. That sucks, man. You better arm your shit. Get up! I'm gonna call him. - Hey, Hector? - I took your money. Hector, what's up man? Don't even think about it. C'mon, honey. I know you won't clip me. Not after all we've been through. Huh? Did you, uh... You ever tell Blair about us? You know, that... one little slip you had? You know... we could, um... we could have another. You can decide. I wouldn't tell. Neither will I. You fucking cocksucker! Really? Burkey, Burkey, Burkey. I always knew you were a dumbass motherfucker, but really? Huh? Going after my own? 'Cause Miles put you up to it? Who says Miles put me up to anything? Ah, c'mon, man! Everyone knows you're too fucking stupid to pull anything off like that yourself. Huh? And how about this, huh? What's this? A fucking pimple? Lola during foreplay? Everyone knows Lola has bigger balls than you. Hey, fuck you! Why don't you just get it over with, you bitch? Oh, it's gonna happen. Don't worry. I mean, the question is, if it's gonna be fast and painless or slow and agonizing? It's really all up to you, yeah? How about we do a little Q and A session? How about that, yeah? If it goes nice and easy... ...I'm fine. If it doesn't, we're gonna have my little version of fun. I got all the time in the world. I wouldn't say that, with Micah gone and all. Ah! Fuck! See, I didn't like that. Did I, huh? Huh? Ah, shit! But let me make something clear. If I don't like something, I'm gonna make damn sure you don't like something either. And we can go back and forth, back and forth, but I promise you, I'm winning the fucking game. What do you want to know? Three things. Where's Micah, where's Miles... and where's Lola? If we have time. Don't you fucking touch Lola, you dickweed! Swing and miss with that one! - Ah! - Huh? I'd be more concerned about what's gonna happen to you, bitch. You wanna try answering the other two? You know what? You can go fuck yourself, Chase! Yeah, that's right. I'm sick of being pushed around - by you, by Miles. - Oh. You can go fuck yourself, asshole! Do your worst! I ain't telling you shit! What are you doing, man? What the hell are you doing in there? Fuck, what the hell are you doing, man? Don't make me shit my pants. That's too much, man. I won't. But let me explain how I'm gonna use this little thing. See, if you take this, and you put it just underneath the fingernail, just like that, and you tap it at the end with a little bit of force, like a hammer. You'd be surprised how easily it slips off. Almost seamless. Quite painful for you, though. I mean, mind you, it's nothing compared to the pain index of the toenails. It'll have you begging to all things holy, and wanting to do just about anything else, but that. Well, let's have a go then, shall we? Get the fuck off me! Get the fuck off me! Burke held up better than I thought, but I got most of the info I needed from him. I mean, not all, of course, 'cause Miles is smarter than that and wouldn't tell that asshat just anything. I mean, the only thing fucking with me right now, was that Miles knew me so well. He would anticipate my moves. Luckily for me, though, I knew how he operated, too. So how did I know you was gonna go after Burke first? Why are you doing this? Actually, I should be thanking you, Chase. You did me a solid. I don't even like that motherfucker. So, who's next? Lola? Gibson? Me? Nah, that ain't your style. You like to work your way up from the bottom. Besides it don't make much sense to eat the dessert if you ain't tackled the main meal yet, right? Why now? Hmm? After all the shit we've been through, huh? Why try to take me down now? Take you down? Shit. To the contrary, baby. Correct you, maybe. But take you down? Oh, no, no, no. See, Chase, you're one of the best to ever do it. Besides, if I wanted to take you down, I'd have put a hit on your ass that night after the job. Well, what the fuck does that mean? To show you, you don't need them. Who? The girl and the kid, nigga. I'll fucking kill you, Miles, you fucking asshole! See, man, that's that emotional bullshit I'm talking about, man. C'mon with that whiny shit. Look, I need you to go back to being a cold, careless motherfucker that I know you to be. It's not me anymore. Oh, but you will be. What the fuck do you mean by that? Yeah, Micah is turning into a real Picasso right now. I think he gets it from his mother. Actually you know what, scratch that, the way he plays it safely in the lines... I know he gets it from his daddy. He's with you right now? Oh, yeah. We're actually having a little bit of a ball right now. Micah is coloring his ass off. He's starting to feel like a fucking son to me. I'm gonna fucking kill you, Miles. I'm telling you that right now. That's a negative, Chase. See, the only thing Micah wants is for his parents to come home from vacation. Now, how long you stay on that vacation, that's entirely up to you, brother. What the fuck do you want from me? What do I want from you? What do I want from you? What do I want from you? I want you to leave them. I want you to leave them both. Look, Micah and Blair can reunite and move wherever the fuck they wanna move. But I want my Chase where I can see him. I want the real Chase, no distractions. What the fuck is your deal, Miles? Huh? I mean, what the fuck is your problem? I mean, do you have a fucking hard-on for me or something? Is that what it is? It's never affected my fucking work, not once. They're fucking separate. I mean you're the one who turned this fucking shit upside down. Look, Chase, I like to keep my investment in check. I told you, the people that make it in this business are the ones epithetic to know what's going on around them. That's the job. Chase, look, man, you want to get your dick wet? Hm? You want to fuck hoes every other night? You have at it. But I know this catching emotion shit and trying to keep it moving, that's what's fucking with you. When you stop to think about it, I'm actually doing you a solid. One day. Pardon me? Give me one day, and I'll think about all of this. In the meantime, you don't fucking touch Micah. And I mean not at all. If I fucking sense any of your fucking dogs hunting him or Blair or me for that matter, I'm gonna fucking come to you, and I'm gonna fucking fuck you up like you've never been fucked up before, you got that? Cool. But know this, you break off any more branches on my operation, I'm gonna make sure Micah turns into an orphan. Real fucking quick. I'm not afraid to die, Chase. Are you? I thought you could use another one. Thanks. Burke didn't make it back, did he? Died en route. Apparently, Chase, uh, really did a number on him. Well, shit, man. You know Chase. Hell, I wouldn't expect anything less. You know, Lola and Burke actually sent some meth heads over there for Chase to take out. Cheers, Burke. Stupid motherfucker. Ah. And cheers to the living. Nostrovia. Do you really think he's going to give it all up, and do what you want? Nah, not at all. Then, what are we going to do? Nothing. This next move right here, is Chase's move. I can think of a few things to help expedite the choices. Does Lola know? Hey, Serg, do me a favor. Next time, bring me a White Russian. Speaking of which, how's this Gomez shit going? I've been working on him all day. He finally talked. Want me to let him go? After all them hours? Man, fuck that. Bring his ass in here. Here's what's left of him. Goddamn, Serg! Shit. You put the paws on that nigga. You told me to tune him up. What the fuck you waiting on, then? Put that Soviet power to good use. Make that motherfucker meet God. Oh, I bet you they wished they'd built that wall now. Where's my boy, Chase? Our boy is coming home soon. I'm on it. I don't like that answer. Well, what am I supposed to say? I want you to answer me honestly, okay? Were you doing a hit for Miles the night I was attacked? You're never gonna change, are you? Not for me, not for Micah. It's never gonna end, is it? I don't know. If there's one thing that's harder than sleeping in general for me, it's sleeping on a flimsy ass couch. I guess Blair was in her right to banish me downstairs anyway. The only reason why I'm not out there fucking up Miles' whole operation right now, is 'cause I'm trying to keep my word for a change. And see if he keeps his. Maybe he was right after all, this life isn't for a family. Maybe in a weird way, he was trying to help me all along. And Blair and Micah would be better off without me. Sometimes I have so much insomnia, I can't tell whether I'm actually sleeping or awake. Blair? Blair? Ah! Fuck! Shit! You see here, this is where I knew I was fucked. Shit! Ah, fuck me! That was just to get your attention. Not a bad throw for doing that while I hold your bitch, huh? Miles sent you, huh? He didn't need to. All he did was tell me what you did to Burke, and I volunteered. Careful, bitch. You don't want me to slip. Come on, Lola, please. Just let her go. I'm telling you. Miles is playing all of us. And his goal is for all of us to kill each other so he can clean house. You know he's calculated like that. You knew these chain of events would play out like this. So, what? You kill Burke and I'm just supposed to eat it? No. Look, how about we swinger this shit? Huh? You do my man, I do your woman. Careful Chase, I'm serious, don't take another fucking step. You're smarter than this. I know Burke put you up to all of this. He always just thought with his little trigger finger. That's why I went for him and not you. Come on, man, Miles has my kid. That's all I want right now. I don't want to end this shit in a firefight. It's already gone too far. Here. You see the knife? There you go, okay? You let her go, you walk out of here, we call it quits. I go over to Miles, I square everything up with him. Nobody else has to die. No. How's that feel, big boy? You're not fucking with Burke anymore, are you? But don't worry, I'll take care of Micah. I'll take of Micah real good. Hell of a shot, baby. - Can you just... - Yeah. ...prop the leg up? Ah, man, Fuck. Watch out, watch out. - Sorry, sorry, sorry. - Okay, okay, okay. - Is that better? - Okay, yeah. Yeah. Come on, now. Okay. We need to get you to the hospital. - No. - Okay, trust me. Trust me, no questions asked. We need get you some real help. We don't have time for that. We gotta get this settled now. By the time... I get to the hospital, Micah will be dead. And Miles is gonna find out sooner or later. - How? - I don't know! He's always been ahead of me my whole life, but he's gonna find out. I'm gonna have to end this now. - Let me go with you. - No. There's too much at stake. Chase. Bring our son back in one piece. That's the only way. I love you. I love you, too. Look, I want you to keep an eye out for tonight, do you hear me? This shit can get real messy. Real soon. Will do, boss. Oh, see I thought you were supposed to be in bed, young man. See, we had a deal. You told me if I let you do one more drawing, it was night-night for you. Are you a deal breaker? Hm? - You a deal breaker? - Aw. But I wanna draw another one in this. Okay. Well, hold on, let me see what you're working with. Oh, look at that. That's beautiful. - Hey, can I have that? - No. It's for Mommy and Daddy. Well, how about the ones over there? No. They're all for Mommy and Daddy. Oh, well, I gotta strong feeling you're gonna see Mommy and Daddy real soon. Really? When? Most likely tonight. Yeah? Both of them? Yeah, both of them. Well, look, I'm gonna need you to do me a favor, no matter what happens, I want you to remember something. I don't ever want you to be like me and your dad. Don't you ever be like us. You're a special kid, Micah. I can see why your dad loves you so much. Hell, you deserve better than this. This life ain't for the normal people. Can I finish this one, still? Please? Please? Yeah, but I'm gonna need you to do me a favor. You gotta promise me that you will keep these headphones on, and listen to your music. Okay? And no matter what, don't you come out this room. Now your mom and dad will be here shortly, and they'll see your beautiful artwork. But in the meantime, you just enjoy that music, okay? Okay. I'll come check on you from time to time, you got me? - Yep. - All right. Are you pumped? This is not a relaxation party. Huh? Be ready. He's coming any minute now. This guy is dangerous! Sergey! Are we pumped or what? Chase won't even make it inside. They are lit. I want everybody to leave. What? Leave the weapons and the ammunition. Have them exit my house. I don't understand, Miles. - I thought that you wanted... - Hey! Get it done. Okay, Miles. All right, guys, let's pack it up. Pack it up. - Davai! Davai! - Whoa, whoa, whoa. What's going on? - What do you mean pack it up? - Just leave, Caleb. It's not happening. I drove a hundred miles, Miles. Stop it, Caleb. I drove a hundred fucking miles, Miles! All right, that's enough of this gay shit. Hey! Jayla, Nathan! Come break this shit up, man. Hey! Get the fuck off! You heard Miles! Get the fuck up! All right, that's it. Party time is over, ladies and gentlemen. Sergey, come get your almost lost ass over here. Everybody else, get the fuck outta my house. Get the fuck out! Move! You know, that big nigga almost beat you. I had him. Shit. Oh, fuck! Ha! Chase! What's up, baby? My man. Hey, I missed you, boy. Look, you remember Sergey, right? Of course. How's the knee? Put a little oil and elbow grease in it once a week, and we're in business. Hey, Chase, you don't mind if he, uh... I mean, you know, it's kind of a precaution. Knock yourself out. We're good. You trained him well, huh? How's the rolling over and barking coming along? Oh, come on, Chase, that's not fair. You're hitting below the belt, baby. Sergey here, is what you call a... - stand-up guy. - Mmm. Sergey, do me a favor. Give me and my man a couple of beats. We gotta rap. Yeah? Woo! Woo! Hey, don't mind him. He's fucking harmless. I bet you when you walked your ass through that door, you thought you had a shitload of SWAT waiting on you, huh? Not really. I kept my end of the bargain, and stayed put. Didn't you? Well, uh, bet you put up a pretty good fight better than Burke though, right? You know, I didn't want it to end this way. Ah, come on. Shit. Sure you did, Chase. It's your killer instinct. Well, you can deny it all you want, we both know it's in there. What's so funny? It wasn't me who did Lola in. - Blair? - Mm. She kinda saved my life. Huh. So, you had the bitch trained better than I thought, huh? Oh, more than you know. Let me ask you a question, Chase. Did you give any serious consideration of what we talked about yesterday? I did. Come on, man, you got me waiting with bated breath, nigga! What's your fucking answer? I'm taking Micah, and I'm leaving. No words, no fights, it's over. I'm choosing my side, Miles. I really didn't want it to end this way. You know, there was a moment when I... despite everything, I was actually gonna choose you. But Lola coming over, and... violating Blair again? Nah, you just did me wrong. Enough is enough. So, are you out then? Okay. You're out. You're fucking out. Just like that, huh? Just like that. Well, fuck it. Guess you're gonna take them both home then, right? Both? Sergey! Bring 'em on out! Get off me! Chase! - You motherfucker! - Man, fuck that! That's two times, motherfucker! That's twice you let your bitch be handled. You fucking piece of shit! Nah, nah, if she was all that to you, you wouldn't let it happen. Again. We know the deal, Chase. Deep down inside, you're a selfish motherfucker. Nigga, you're just like me! You can't see that shit? Let's fucking drop this, okay? Drop all of this. Okay? Nah, this thing ain't be on me, playboy, this one's on you. But I'll tell you what, though, since I'm a good dude, I actually like your boy. I'm gonna let him and mom deuce bounce. But you ain't never gonna see the motherfuckers again. Well, what am I supposed to fucking do? Well, go get your ass back on that block, like one of my hoes, and get paid for what you're good at. Killing people. Oh, wait a minute. We know you don't just kill the bad guys, do you? Don't you fucking dare. Yeah, why don't you let everybody know who else you've killed. What the hell is he talking about? He doesn't know what he's fucking talking about! He's a fucking moron! Why don't you let Ms. Blair know what happened to her daddy? He's a fucking liar, like you always said! You know what, Chase has never been a particularly good storyteller. So I think I'll take over. Hell, I'll even throw in some of Micah stories. Now, is this the part where you tell us who killed Micah's real parents? Didn't you have something to do with that? Huh, Chase? Oh, Chase? Hmm? I did. Ah! Blair. See, doesn't that feel better? To get that burden off your chest? Yeah, but there's no going back now, is there? I mean even if she was fucking stupid enough to take you back. Can you imagine how that would look? Her having to look in the eyes of the man that killed her daddy. And Micah's real parents. Bring it down! Wait a minute, Blair. Don't, don't even talk. I don't even wanna hear you right now. Who are you? Who are you anymore? Maybe you should just get it over and done with, huh? Get Micah, and... let me bleed out. It's not gonna change the past, but... it's definitely gonna... stop things from happening in the future. Mommy! Baby, don't look. Don't look, okay? Just focus on me, focus on me, okay? Look what I got for you and Daddy. Yeah, I love these. They're so great. Are you ready to go home? - Yeah. - Okay, let's go home. Just don't look, okay? Okay, just go to the door, come on. - Okay, good boy. - Mm. Oh, god. Oh. Daddy got a boo-boo. Hey, champ. Daddy is just resting. Mommy is gonna take you home now. - Okay? - Okay. No. Mommy is gonna take Daddy to the hospital and make sure he's okay. Is that okay, Micah? Yeah, I want Daddy to get better. Yeah, he needs to get better. It's a funny thing, how memories and dreams can capture a person in a better light. Slight changes. Micah, looking calm. Blair, looking a bit better and at ease. The intricacies of people. I love to give me a better peace of mind. Even thinking about Miles now. Of course, I think about all of his jokes. His humor, his friendship. Miles was right about a lot of things, as cynical as they were. Nobody could escape the life. Nobody. It was more than an a addiction. It was an uncontrollable desire to continue and put anybody's life at risk, including your own. It was never gonna end pretty for either one of us. I think I chose my fate the minute Miles had me enter this world at 15. The moment I really started living, was also the moment I started dying. I always remembered the quote, "Death is not the opposite of life, but a part of it." The next level. In all the years I've been doing my job, I had the unique pleasure of choosing that moment for so many people. Like I said, I never worried if they were good or bad or anything about them. Just that I control the outcome. But now... I might not be able to control my own. Fuck! I don't know why... but when I close my eyes, all I could picture is the advice Blair gave me to fall asleep. I imagine Micah on my shoulders and covering my eyes and, me moving forward. One step. One step. It was getting easier and easier for me to doze off. Micah was gonna do just fine. I can only hope I shielded him enough from what I did to keep him completely unscathed. I influenced Blair enough to see a switch in her, but the core of who you are... always stays intact. That's at least what I hope for Micah. He deserves better than this life. I think I can sleep now.
