LaTrice, sometimes things aren't as complicated as we make them. There's always home. Dream for a reason. - There's always home. - Dream for a reason. - There's always home. - Dream for a reason. Now that's what I need me right there. Something like that Mmhm. She look like she doing just fine with who she got and don't need nothing like you. I was talking about the car, Theona. Whatever, both of them too fast for your broke ass. Now how do you know she fast? 'Cause them shoes and that car ain't cheap. - Which means she gotta be? - You tell me. You the expert on fast, cheap women. Theona please. For all you know, that girl could be a new customer. She ain't coming in here. Where she gets her hair done, they don't have customers, they have clients. Her hair got Snob Hill hair weaved all over it. ♪ Who's that lady, real fine lady ♪ Like I said, she ain't coming in here to be nobody's customer, she's already somebody's client, so you can put your chest away and stop sucking in your gut, Davis Witherspoon. I was looking at the car, Theona. - Mm-hm. - Y'all two need to stop fussing all the time, get remarried, and make a baby. It'll be a snowy day in the middle of a Oakland summer before that ever happens. Oh, that's cold, Theona. ♪ Who's that lady ♪ And man falleth from grace, not by wickedness, but by weakness and the power of temptation. ♪ Who's that lady, who's that lady ♪ ♪ Real fine lady, who's that lady ♪ ♪ Hear me callin' out to you ♪ 'Cause it's all that I can do♪ ♪ Your eyes tell me to pursue ♪ Who's that lady, who's that lady ♪ ♪ Sexy lady - Nice shoes. - Oh, thank you. You're not looking to open up a shop, are you? 'Cause one fantastic fashion boutique is already too much for this block to handle, you know. I mean, folks around here aren't spending the money to be wearing the kind of clothes you're wearing. Well, if I should decide to open up a shop, rest assured, it won't be a clothing store. Good. Thanks for the tip. Let me know what you think, I would love to continue all the good work that we've been doing, okay? Thanks so much, bye bye. I know it's a little less convenient, but I believe that the extra 30 minute drive would be worth it, considering all the progress that we've made. Hi Shelby, it's Dr. Monroe. You can just put them in there, and that can go in the front. I wonder what kind of place she's opening up down there. Whatever it is, it's her business, so stop spying on her. Come on inside. She been here 15 minutes and you already defending her. What you talking about, Theona? All I said was her business ain't none of your business. Now how's that defending the lady? Oh, now she's a lady? 12 seconds ago she was a woman, now she's a lady. What you gonna make her next, her majesty? I swear to Jesus, Theona, you can turn something into nothing. Ha, don't bring Jesus into this. Jesus ain't got nothing to do with this, Davis. You the one standing here turning water into wine, all of a sudden talking about Jesus. I think you in the wrong building... - Theona, I swear to Jesus. - You need to be next door giving sermons right now as much as you know about Jesus all of a sudden. Don't need no encyclopedia when you around. You know what I'm gonna, you know what I'm a get you? - 'Cause you know everything. - I'm a get you a... Yeah, you can just put it in there. Yes, that's great, thank you. - Ow, what'd you do that for? - Por que? You're more interested in watching what's going on next door than helping me open up for business. We don't have any business yet. I mean, that's because we're not ready for any. Let me have my cafecito, - chica. - Que no. Oh, please, please, please be careful with the corners, this is kangaroo leather. We're being careful, lady. Decided to move in after all, huh? Yes, I did, I just decided to make a go of it. - A go of what exactly? - Uh, I'm a therapist. So, you're gonna be giving people massages in there. No, I'm, I'm a psychologist, I have a PhD in psychology, I'm Dr. LaTrice Monroe. - Rodney. - Rodney. Rodney Smalls, professionally Mali. I hope you're not overpaying on the rent because, you know, Marquis will hike me and everybody else up if you start giving him all this cash. Oh no, I don't think so, I think the rent is - pretty reasonable. - Uh huh. I have to watch these guys, but we're neighbors, so I'm sure - I'll see more of you. - Yeah, anyways, all right. Well, if I knew this place was gonna have that kind of view, I'd have moved in myself. Sorry, didn't mean to come up on you like that, my bad. - You are? - Your landlord. - Oh, hi. - Hi. - I'm... - Dr. LaTrice Monroe, your name's on the agreement. Yeah, my property management company, that's virtual, but the paperwork, much like myself, is real. - You own the building. - No, I own - the block actually. - Wow. Well listen, call me, day or night, you know, if you need something unplugged or screwed in. - Yeah, that sounded crazy. - No. I'm sorry, listen, I just like to keep my renters happy. Oh, but I'm not a renter, I signed a lease. Yes you did, you paid for an entire year - up front. - Yep. Gotta say, I like your style. - Thank you, Mr. King. - Please, call me Marquis. Price of gas done went up three more cents, seven in the past two months. What you worried about seven cents for? You don't drive nowhere but here and back home. Theona, how you know where I be in my car with my gas? I don't and I don't care. You the one that started the conversation. I didn't start nothing, all I said was gas went up, I ain't say nothing about me - being somewhere. - Mm-hm. See how men do? All the time starting so you don't finish. Mm-hm, you ain't lying about that, - Theona. - Morning. How y'all doing this morning? Hey girl, look at you with your short pants on. Woo yeah, it's hot out there today. How you doing, Spoon, what you doing, reading the paper? Jeanette, you see me sitting here reading this paper, now why is you gonna ask me if I'm doing something - you already see me doing? - Now why is he tripping? I'm just trying to make a little Saturday morning conversation, that's all. If he don't wanna talk, I can drop off what I'll drop off and go on about my business. Now, y'all ain't got nothing but a water bill and a Essence magazine. I left all your junk mail on the truck because it is too hot to be pushing all of that. Now, if you want to read that and study your paper, I'll go on back to the truck and get it. Don't pay him no mind, he's just upset about gas going up three cents. I am not upset that gas went up three cents. I was sitting here reading the paper, commented that gas done went up seven more cents in the past two months, that's all. Well, what are you upset about, is it the three cent or the seven cent? - I am not upset. - He's sitting there acting upset like he don't know he upset. Girl, that's borderline crazy. You know maybe you need to go see that new head doctor just moved in three doors down, but would you let him, Theona, because woo, that is a pretty sister. She mixed, probably got some Cherokees in her, too. - Have you seen her? - Mm-hm, Davis just about passed out, sucking in his gut and sticking out his chest looking at her. - Oh, is that right? - I was looking at the car, - Theona. - Mm-hm. Why would somebody smart enough to be a doctor with all that kind of money wanna put a head shop in this neighborhood? What's wrong with this neighborhood? It's full of Black people. And what's wrong with Black people? Black people don't talk about they problems. Not their real problems. Mm-mm, we keep that deep down inside, it's between us and God. Maybe Jeanette's right, maybe you should go see your lady doctor fantasy girlfriend, get your head shrunk. You want me to ask if she have any openings to shrink your head? - Morning, Rev. - Well, good morning Sister Ellis, how you doing today? - Oh, hot and working. - Now, Sister Ellis... I know, I need to quit acting a fool in my father's house. Missed you at bible study last night. Oh yeah, don't tell nobody, but I fixed dinner for my son, he came up from under just to spend a few minutes with his mama. Oh, isn't that sweet? It sure is, Sister Ellis, it sure is. Well, just look at me just carrying on about my boy when I need to be letting you handle your business. I got a letter here for you and it's from Florida State. You know something, it might be some good news in here. Maybe they going put your name on the side of a building, honor you with your name on a stadium. Wouldn't that be something? It would, Sister Ellis, but... - Woo. - Lest we forget, it is not good to eat much honey, nor is it glorious to seek one's own glory, Proverbs 25:27. You know, with all the philosophy and fancy preaching you do, I bet you'd have a lot to talk about with that new head doctor. I hear that they say she is as smart and rich as she is good looking. But see, what I don't understand, what I can't figure, is why would she set up here? I mean, what's she gonna do that we ain't getting done? We got you and you got God. Well, well, we all have God, Sister Ellis, and He has a plan for each and every - one of us. - Yeah, maybe so. Got the place looking pretty good. Some new paint, new plastic people, a crazy looking wallpaper. - Yeah. - How much that cost? I'd raise your rent, but since you're already behind last month's, I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna give you to the first of this coming month for you to catch up in full, how does that sound? I'm doing the best I can, Marquis. I'll pay you what I owe you as as soon as I'm able, it's just, business has just been slow. You see, that's the problem right there. I said I'll pay you as soon as I can. Come here for a second. It's not what you said, it's what you didn't say. You didn't say Mr. King, you said Marquis. Well guess what, Marquis ain't here. Mr. King your landlord is here and you're behind on your rent. I can't pay you what I don't have... And that being the situation, you still felt comfortable enough to not pay me some respect. And how can you expect someone who doesn't pay you any respect to pay you anything at all, you know what I'm saying? - Yeah. - That's crazy. So, I want all my money on the first or else you and all this stuff is gonna be out on the street, - as simple is that. - Yeah. Oh hey, Mother Keys. Don't you hey me, Jeanette Ellis, you've been lightening your load and leaving me without my coupons. I need my coupons, you hear me? Okay Mother Keys, you're right, my bad. I will make sure that I deliver you all the coupons on my truck with your name on it and some, all right? - I guess that'd be all right. - I'll see you in a while. Mm mm mm, child, you need to put on some long pants 'cause Lord knows you too big boned to have on them short pants. I don't know what she talking about, I make these short pants look good. - How you doing today, girl? - I'm fine, Jeanette. - Where's Papa Jesus? - Said he had to take care of something this morning. Should have been here by now, though. Well, I hope the feds ain't snatched him up and shipped him off to Mexico or nothing. - Jeanette. - Give me a pack of that gum. - Crazy. - Oh girl, you know, you know me, I'm just playing with you. Shoot, I wish somebody would come around here talk about they'd wanna take y'all out and put you on the other side of some damn wall. Hoo, they gonna have to come through me and everybody else on this block, you see what I'm saying? We're legal, I was practically born here and Dad came from - Cuba when he was 33. - 34, your mother was 33. - Hey Jesus, how you doing? - Fine, Jeanette. You bring me anything worth reading or just more bills? Ugh, same old, same old, just more bills. That's okay, we're still living the American dream, right? Speaking of the American dream, give me one of those quick pick tickets right quick. Yeah, I don't wanna be a working girl - walking these streets forever. - Here you go, good luck. Oh, I'm not gonna need luck. I had a dream about this last night after eating catfish and cornbread with my son. Watch, you'll see, we dream for a reason. This is my ticket to being rich and famous. Oh, and speaking of rich and famous, have y'all seen your new neighbor? Dad's been staring at her butt every chance - he gets. - Well, he's not alone. I mean, either everybody is either looking at it or - talking about it, you know. - Right. Listen, I'm going over there right now, but I am telling you, I'm not opening my mouth, I'm not saying a word. I'd never ever say a word to nobody about him. So, how long has your son been - an FBI agent? - Special agent. Going on seven years now, but he's been undercover - the last two. - I bet you miss seeing him. I miss him terribly, but I know he's helping to keep America safe and if him seeing his mama have to take a backseat, then it's okay with me. Oh, this couch is nice. - Is that the trick? - The trick? To getting folks to tell they secrets and they problems, you put 'em on this comfortable couch. There's no trick, Jeanette. People talk because they want to. People need to express what's going on on the inside, which often manifests to what's happening - to them on the outside. - Ugh, sounds complicated. If people spend some time examining why they're feeling the way they're feeling, it can lead to an understanding of why they're doing the things that they're doing and vice versa, and then all of that leads to a knowledge of self, which can then bring about the desired change in their behavior or the circumstances. So, why are you here, why are you doing what you doing? I know you didn't just wake up one day and leave the world you belong to, to come down here and kick it with your people for no reason. Have a nice weekend, Shelby. Thank you so much. Yes, yes, and listen, remember, we're much more than who we're with. - Okay. - Okay? But what if I'm with, like, George Clooney? He was, in just a hypothetical world, if he was single. - No, mm-mm. - Okay, I'll see you tomorrow. Okay, well no, tomorrow's Saturday. - I bought Saturday. - Okay. All right. See you. Show me your diploma. Ah. It's man trouble, ain't it? What kind of trifling fool would mess up so that he'd lose a catch like you? - Grant. - I'm sorry, Dr. Monroe, I didn't mean to interrupt your session. - Uh... - Oh well honey, I ain't paying, so you ain't interrupting nobody's session. Girl, you go on handle your business. He kinda fine for a white boy, you see what I'm saying? Oh, I'll be here on Monday with your mail, darling. Okay Jeanette, thank you. What are you doing here? I came here to see if you were ready to be reasonable and reconcile. I figured I'd give you some time to come to your senses over that meaningless dalliance and to see if we could make up with a dinner. - My treat. - Oh. Just to be clear, you and your little ding dong have a meaningless dalliance practically right in my face, which causes me to walk out of your life, and then you waltz your little lying, cheating, trifling ass into my new office and practically demand a reconciliation over dinner, your treat? Come on, LaTrice, you know I'm no good at this. And I have no idea what trifling arse means, but I'm here, darling, and I'm trying. What do you say? I say get out, Grant. - Are you serious? - Yes. You want to throw away everything we had just so that you can play witch doctor to these people? These people, you arrogant ignoramus, are my people. LaTrice, can we, can we just have a little reality check, okay? These people are no more your people than they are mine. Yes, they're your color, but they're not your kind and the sooner that we can come to grips with, with that reality, we can begin to reconcile. So, dinner? No, okay, no. Yeah. You wanna know what trifling means? Trifling means trivial, inconsequential, petty, and insignificant. Look, you're obviously not ready to talk right now, - so I'll... - Get outta here.

He's a rap artist, - not a gangster. - Same damn thing. - Yo, what's cracking, y'all? - Yo ass is what's cracking. Pull your pants up, boy. And don't come out that bag with nothing 'cause ain't nobody in here buying. Oh, you gonna come in Glock-9 like that, Pops? If I was your Pops, your pants would be up. Leave him alone, Davis. Hi Dwayne, how you doing, baby? I'm fine, Miss Theona, but yo, can you call me Glock-9? - I'm trying to build my brand. - Aw, that's cute. So, what you got today, new CDs? Yeah look, so I spit these last night, all right? - They're dope. - Theona, don't waste your money on that mess. It's my money, I can spend it whatever way I like. How much today, Glock-9? All right, $2.99 for one or two for $5. I think I will get two. Get my Christmas shopping for Davis done early. - Huh. - Hey, anybody else? 'Cause my bars are on a whole new level right now. Anything worth the listening to, I got right there in that jukebox over there. That thing's been broke since before we got here and who knows how long before that. Still don't mean what's inside ain't good. Man, that thing's so old, it's not even old school. That was before the old school. - When music was music. - I'll fix it if you want. - Aww. - I'm really good at like, you know, hooking up electronics, video games, whatever you need. I'll do it for free if you let me sample some of the songs for my beats. No, you ain't gonna mix up the good with the bad. - It's gonna stay broke. - All right, man. Yo, let me know if you change your mind before my offer expires. Before your offer expire, huh? Boy, get your butt outta here before I call the police - on you. - All right. Glock-9 out, gotta bounce. Bye Dwayne, I mean, Glock-9. Bye, Celine Shot. You should be nicer to the boy. Bad enough he has no family to speak of. All I know is that boy better not touch my jukebox. You got some lifesavers in your mouth? 'Cause I can't understand a thing you saying. Mm-hm. It's cheap, man, it ain't that expense... For real? Yo, why you all the time gotta trip, Rodney? Ain't like I'm asking you to be tracked in, all I'm asking you for is to sling - my beats in your shop, man. - Do you see what I sell here? I sell wraps, okay, not bad rap. Whatever man, you'd probably make hella more cheddar off of my jams than these weak ass rags you trying to hustle. Yeah. You sure you don't need any money? I don't need any money, Dad. - And I'm fine... - We can helicopter over - to the mainland... - Yo. - Uh. - Excuse me. Dad, lemme call you right back, someone just walked in. - Who, Grant? - No, it's not Grant. - Love you. - Bye now. Bye. Okay, that was rude. Did you not see that I was on the phone? All right, well, I said excuse me. What you said was, "Yo, excuse me." All right, my bad. But you off the phone now, right, so can I holler at you for a minute? - What is your name? - Glock-9. - And how old are you? - Old enough. Okay, now you're lying and you're rude. I know your mother taught you better than that. - I ain't got no mother. - Oh, I see. So, how can I help you, Mr. Nine? Actually, I'm here to help you. - Really? - Mm-hm. - How's that? - Well, you're new on the block, right? I suppose I am. Yeah, you know, your situation ain't exactly popping, right? And this right here, Glock-9's latest and greatest flame. Look, you buy a dozen of these for $2.99 a piece and then you flip it and sell it for $4.99 a piece and you got people lining up outside your shop just to get in here to talk to you. - You feel me? - I do feel you, but I don't sell anything in here. What do you do here then, what's your hustle? My hustle is that I help people find answers. - Answers to what? - To whatever they may be questioning in their lives. Well, you ain't gonna make no type of cheddar around here with a lame hustle like that. - Really? - Yeah. - Why not? - Because nobody gonna give you they money to talk about they stuff when they don't know you or what you about. I mean, look, you got some buzz, but you ain't got no street cred. Only thing the block know about you is that you rich. - And pretty. - Pretty? Mm-hm, and rich. So, how many of my CDs you want? Let me see. - Hm, gimme two. - All right, for sure. A honey, man. A faithful man showed up bound with blessings, but he that maketh haste to be rich shall not be innocent. What are you up to, Marquis? You shall not take vengeance or bear grudge against the sons of your own people, but you shall love your neighbor as yourself, I am the Lord. I'm sorry, I wasn't sure what time service started. Well, our times are in His hands. Have a seat right down in front, Sister Monroe. Thank you, excuse me, sorry. - She got on the phone. - She got some nerve coming up in here late and dressed in that dress. She late, but that dress is right on time. Judge not, that you be not judged. And in that spirit, let us welcome our newest neighbor, Dr. LaTrice Monroe. I'd like to think that her services, like herself, will be a welcome addition to the block and the neighborhood. For we are members of one another. - Somebody say amen. - Amen. I'd like to get to our feet for a little Sunday morning singing and praise giving. Mother Keys, if you please. Now people, the Bible says do unto others as you'd have them do unto you.

Okay, okay, I'm sorry, my bad. That must have been hard to end the way it did. Yeah, I'd be lying if I say it didn't hurt and that I don't miss it sometimes, but uh, I don't miss who I was or where I was at the time, do you? Oh. I was born here in Oakland. Yeah, I grew up right around in Havenscourt. - What, Havens... - Yeah, right next to Flints Barbecue. - What? - Yes. I, I wouldn't have thought, I, - well... - Well. Yeah, we left when I was 11.

We might be from different faiths, but it's all the same God. Do you believe God punishes us for our mistakes, for our sins? I believe God is a loving and forgiving God and that we, his children, often without mercy punish ourselves for things we regret we've done. If whatever it is, is troubling you, He will help you see it through. Everything was perfect and then he had to go and ruin the whole night by popping the question. - Well, and? - And He had the nerve to ask if getting Botox injections hurt 'cause he was thinking about surprising his mother with a treatment for her 50th birthday. I mean, can you imagine? Shelby, how old was this man? I don't know, 27, maybe 28. Old enough to know better than to bring up his mommy when asking a lady about her beauty secrets. Shelby, you know that dating a younger man is not the way to build up your self esteem. I am not a cougar. My friend Olivia, now she's a cougar. - Olivia, who's Olivia? - Well, she's just a couple - years older than moi. - Mm-hm. She's had the little tiniest bit of work done to her face, breasts, butt, hips and thighs. Oh, she's had her lips done, too, but I mean, who hasn't? Um. - Oh my god. - Oh my god what? I caught cougar-it is from Olivia. Shelby, you know, passing judgment on yourself predicated on comparing yourself to others is always a bad choice. No, I know, I know I'm not Olivia. I mean, I love her, but I don't want to be her. Not in any way, shape, or form. Although she does have a nice shape. And she should, she certainly paid enough for it. Who do you wanna be, Shelby? I want to be Myself. And who is that? Sue Ellen Beryl Dickstead, that's who. I can't believe how good I feel right now. It's a completely different woman. You're the best, LaTrice. You do you, boo. I'll see you when I need you. - Drive safe, Shelby. - Okay, mami. You must be real good if you can turn Barbie into - Erykah Badu. - Theona, hi, welcome. I was in the neighborhood, so thought I'd come by, take a look at your shop. You've seen mine, figured I'd come see yours. - Oh. - Huh. Hm. Sure is different than the other shops in the neighborhood. Well, it's a work in progress. You look like somebody who needs to talk. - Oh no. - What? Just 'cause you sat in my chair doesn't mean I'm a lay on your couch. I get on that thing, people call me crazy. So, you can forget about that, ain't gonna happen. Shoot. I mean, even if I did want to talk, - which I don't... - Mm-hm. It would be over a cup of coffee at my kitchen table, not crying to you on your couch 'cause I ain't crazy. I mean, it hurt so bad, I can't even put into words how bad it hurt. Davis and me, we were supposed to be together forever. I knew that from the very first time I laid eyes on him. He was playing basketball in the park And I was there with my girlfriends watching the boys play. Davis had on shorts, no shirt, and was covered in sweat. Girl, he was fine. He was staring at me so hard he got hit in the face by a no look pass. Ball hit him so hard gave him a bloody nose. Everybody was laughing at him. Davis didn't care. He just kept right on staring at me, smiling. After the game, he asked me out on a date and that was it. The first boyfriend I ever had ended up becoming my husband. So, you see, not only did I lose my best friend, I lost the only man I've ever known and who meant everything to me to another woman who didn't mean anything to him. How do you get right with something like that? You don't, you can't, but you can forgive. Could you forgive him? That's a question that you're gonna have to answer for yourself, Theona. But you get to decide. - Dr. Monroe. - You are so wrong on so many levels. LaTrice, LaTrice, LaTrice, please, please, let me explain, - let me explain. - What? That wasn't physical, that was the purely psychosexual. Wow, the Sigmund Freud defense. - Really, Grant... - Now, if we just talk about this rationally, - though... - Let go of me. I love you, I love you. Whoa, don't inch me up too close, I don't need you bumping me up, you know? I been cutting your hair as half as long as you've been alive. Have I ever bumped you up? No, but I also don't want today to be the day that you start bumping me up. I don't tell you how to sew, you don't tell me how to - clean up no kitchen. - I ain't got no kitchen. - Okay, how's that? - Oh Theona, it's beautiful. Girl, Hollywood ain't got nothing on you. But I'm gonna have to sleep standing up - so I don't mess it up. - Mm, well we'll have to see what Mr. Keys has to say about that now. Child, I look so good that Mr. Keys is gonna have to handle his business standing up or down on all fours. Ooh, Mother Keys, you know you need to stop now. Well, as long as it's still good, honey, I don't need to stop. All right, here you go. That's a little something for you. Aw, thank you, thank you. And I'll take care of you on the first. All right, see you at church. Woo, this is where my people at. Hey Spoon, hey Rodney. Oh, and look at you, is this Miss America or Miss Keys looking this good up in here? Oh Jeanette, get outta my way with your crazy self. That old woman is strong. Hey Rodney, I heard your business is picking up. White folk could start buying your stuff. I'm telling you, P. Diddy, Kanye, Jay-Z and them, they wasn't hitting it all that much until them white kids start buying their music. - Yeah baby, you on your way. - Come on. - Hey, Theona. - Hmm. I heard you hit the couch, how was it? - Felt good, right? - Jeanette. You been down to that head shop? - You ain't tell Spoon? - It's supposed to be private. Oh, I'm sorry, my bad. Here's your mail, I'm out, okay, my bad. Theona, you been down there talking to that shrink? I thought you liked her. What's that got to do with it? And what was y'all talking about, me? If you must know, I was talking 'bout me. How's you gonna talk about you without talking 'bout me? Maybe you should go try it and see for yourself, hm? It'd be a snowy day in a Oakland summer before that ever happened, I'll tell you that much. - Davis, you working today? - Yes, I am working today. - Going in my business. - I'm working right now. Look at this, look at all the work I'm doing. - It seems personal. - Look at all the - work I'm doing. - It seems personal. I'm so full of guilt, couldn't even look her in the eye. And she ain't yell and she ain't hit, she just stood there, hurt. Do you know why you did what you did? Ain't no good explanation and it cost me my wife, my best friend. Theona didn't deserve none of what I had done to her. But the worst part is I can't fix it, I can't make her forget. I swear to God I wish I could, even if it meant her ever, never not knowing me. Did you ever tell her how you feel? We can't get three words into a conversation without fussing and fighting with one another. Why I gotta apologize? You the one who started it. - Bringing up... - Bringing up what, Davis? - The truth? - Theona, that was a long time ago, long time ago. Now we are here doing what we doing how we doing it. I made you a plate, it's in the back. You know you shouldn't be drinking in the middle of the day and on an empty stomach. What you think would happen if you started your next conversation with these three words: I love you? ♪ You came into my world ♪ ♪ I was a bright inquisitive girl ♪ I have missed you so much and I don't want there to be any more misunderstandings between us, so. ♪ You said you loved me oh so much ♪ Marry me? ♪ I sooner lost control ♪ First my heart then my soul.

Please call the athletic department coordinator. You know, there's been a whole bunch of robberies in this area as of late. Anyway, it's probably just a good thing not to keep a whole bunch of cash on hand. No problem there. We're not exactly Whole Foods. Well, you look like you're doing pretty good to me. Have a nice day, okay? - Take care, Mr. Salgado. - You too, Officer Daniels. Just because he has a uniform and a gun does not mean you let him talk to you any way he wants. He was only flirting with me. He was disrespecting you and in front of your father. - I'm not a child. - You're not a puta either, so you shouldn't let yourself be treated like one. Bodega USA. Just a minute, please. Papa? The doctor's office. Hello? Yes, this is Mr. Salgado. What is it about death that frightens you? Being dead, that's what's frightening about death. I'm just not ready. I want to be with my beautiful Erlinda again, but the thought of my not seeing my Angelica married to a good man, my grandchildren growing up. You need to fight, Mr. Salgado. Fight for Angelica, fight for these grandchildren you wanna see grow up. You need to fight for yourself. I have a feeling that Erlinda, she will be rooting for you. - What is this? - Something to help you throw the first punch. ♪ Me and the devil ♪ Walkin' side by side ♪ Me and the devil ♪ Man, who the hell do you think you are? ♪ Walkin' side by side Theona, you about done? 'Cause I can't concentrate on this shave with you over there making all that noise and blowing hot air. Huh? I can't hear you. That's what I'm talking about, camaraderie and commerce. Shop is popping. What's happening, my Black people? Talk about making noise and blowing hot air. What you want, Marquis? - It ain't the first. - See, that attitude and that mouth is why you ain't a married woman no more. Something I can do for you, Marquis? Actually, there is. You can be out by the end of next month. What you talking 'bout, out by the end of next month? It's right there in black and white. Notice to vacate the premises? - That's right. - Marquis, you know damn well we have a lease agreement and we ain't been late paying, - not once. - It's true. You've never been late with the payment and I appreciate it, but what you need to appreciate is the fact that you don't have a lease agreement. What you have is a rental agreement. The hell is you talking about, Marquis? What difference does it make what you call it? Makes all the difference in the world. Uh-uh, whatever the difference is, you can't just throw us out in the street. I beg to differ. The law and the fine print says that I can. Throw y'all out? What's going on, what I miss? Oh, shut the hell up, crazy mail lady, business is being talked. - Why I... - Mm. Why Marquis, why is you doing this? Lemme cut to the chase. - I'm selling the block. - Selling the block? To who, who buying? - We'll talk to them. - You can talk to whoever you want, they're still gonna tear down, pave over, and use this land as a parking lot. - Parking lot? - That's right, the parking lot business is a $30 billion a year enterprise. Ain't nobody giving a damn about the parking lot business. - We care about ours. - Yeah, and I care about me and mine. I expect the rent check on the first just like always. Y'all have a nice day now. Oh, I swear to God, that man is the devil his self. Davis, what we gonna do? Don't know if there's anything we can do. Well, I know what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna buy the whole block. Jeanette, we in real trouble and you standing here talking crazier than usual. I ain't talking nobody's crazy. Y'all ain't got a thing to worry about, all right? Everything is gonna be all right, you'll see, because I gotcha. I mean, don't have to worry at all, I gotcha, all right? I gotcha. Where the hell did he go? That's your friend, that's, that's, that's your friend. Yeah. ♪ Walkin' side by side ♪ Me and the devil Papa, what are you doing? - I'm okay. - That's too heavy for you. No, no, no, it's not too... Give it to me. It's too heavy for you, get out of the way. You look quite sick. - You're sick. - I'm not sick, I'm dying. - Hey? - Don't say that, - you're not dying. - You heard the doctor. I don't care about that stupid doctor. I got a cousin who's a stupid doctor. Dumb as they come, graduated last in his class. I wouldn't go to that knucklehead for a paper cut. - Can I help you, Mr. King? - Damn. That is why I like you, Mr. Salgado. You understand business and you have a concept of respect. What can we do for you, Marquis? Just came by to bring you this. By the way, saw a young brother running outta here with a handful of pull pies while I was coming in. I don't exactly think he took the time to pay for it, so you might wanna check and see what else is missing. Y'all take care. When Mr. Salgado calls, I need him to be seen and I need him to be seen right away. Whatever's not covered, I will handle personally. Yes, yes, thank you so much. Yes, okay, bye bye. I do like a woman who squeezes hard and gets the job done. - Mr. King. - Marquis. Marquis, to what do I owe this pleasure? I came to make you a little proposal. Well, if this proposal has anything to do with lying on my couch, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to take a professional pass. That is blunt and beautiful, I like that. But no, this proposal is actually of a professional nature, not human nature. I have a black belt in mind games. I have a business opportunity that requires me to sell all of my real estate assets for investment capital purposes. And what about all the block's businesses? Buildings get torn down, land gets redeveloped. So, you want all the tenants to agree to allow you to break our leases. I've only got one lessee. All the others are just renters, month to month, with one that's damn near on a layaway plan. But what about their livelihoods? - Their livelihoods? - Yes. Well, they got they problems, I gots mines that I am going to do something about when I sell out to that construction consortium that's building that shopping center across the street. They're gonna build these upscale condos on top of a 10 story parking lot. Honey, that's gonna be real pretty. I mean, you know, except for the parking lot, that's probably gonna be pretty ugly. Does this proposal have a point? Yes and the point is you don't belong here, Dr. Monroe, we both know that. You are wasting your time and your talents down here trying to fix these folks that don't even know they're broke. Why don't you get on this free money making situation? You know something, Marquis? There's no such thing as a free money situation. What you need is for me to agree to be bought out so you can sell, right? Well, it is either all coming down or coming down all around you. Let me tell you something, Marquis. I know exactly who you are, what you are, and how you operate. So why do you do what you do? I don't know why I do what I do, I just know that I have to do it. Ah. Did you ever think that maybe by helping others, you're helping yourself? That by helping others to be their best selves, you become your best self? Are you your best self, LaTrice? I don't know. You tell me, am I? That's a question only you can answer, LaTrice. None of this started happening until she showed up on the block. I know she ain't here, why ain't she here? Because she cut a deal, that's why. - No no no no. - Wait now, brothers and sisters, - please. - Come on, that's not right. Brothers and sisters, please. I knew she wasn't nothing but trouble from the minute Davis laid eyes on her. Now wait a minute, now Proverbs 23... Reverend, please. No disrespect, but this ain't no time for proverbs and prayer. We talking about losing our neighborhoods, our livelihoods. - We in a crisis. - Which is no time for us to turn against one another and lose our way. We have to tackle this thing together as a team. This ain't no game, this it for real. We ain't talking about playing for no big signing bonuses or no championship rings or anything else you used to in your past life... Brother Davis, Brother Davis, Brother... Talking about our lives here. Stop it, stop it, all of you. I did not come to this country to fight with our neighbors and our friends. - So please, stop it. - Papito. I mean, how can we stop him from selling if he owns the buildings? Isn't that his right? Just 'cause he owns the buildings don't mean he got the right to ruin the businesses that's in 'em. Maybe for all we know, LaTrice could be the answer to our problems, not the problem. Look, she's rich, maybe she loans us a little money so we can hire a lawyer to sue Marquis. I'm not as well off as the talk of the block would have you believe. I'm far from whore, yes, but I'm also far from sitting on a family fortune. Marquis did offer me a deal. We trusted you. I know. Marquis had no choice but to approach me and try to strike a bargain, - but I didn't accept his offer. - Why, because he low balled you? No. Stay away from them if you know what's good for you. Because it wasn't right for us. And you would've only been sleeping with the devil. I told you I gotcha, don't worry. I want you to meet my pride and joy, my baby boy, Special Agent Edmund Ellis. Well hello, nice to meet you. I've heard a great deal about all of you and my mother has explained to me the basic facts pertaining to your predicament. Your landlord, Mr. King, he's got a predicament or two of his own, starting with the fact that he owes Uncle Sam a substantial amount of unpaid taxes from years of undeclared - income. - The income he got - from all of us. - No doubt. Who'd have thought, with all Jeanette's nonsense, her son was actually working undercover for the FBI? - Jeanette boy is real? - Real as you and me. And you should see him, girl, good looking. I mean, Denzel-icious. Ooh, he that good looking? - Mm-hm, smart too. - Too young for y'all. If I didn't know any better, I'd say you a little jealous, Davis. And you'd be lying to yourself. What I want to know is what's gonna happen to your shop. I'm on a fixed income, so somebody tell me, where's a fastidious man on a fixed income supposed to get a quality $5 haircut? That's what I thought, crickets. Jeanette's boy say he's gonna pull a few strings and see if he can't find out what the numbers are and a few other things to give us the inside track, but after that, we gotta take it from there. No matter how much it is, it's gonna be more than any of us can afford. Jeanette wasn't lying 'bout her son, maybe she's not lying about her lottery ticket, maybe it's a winner. And maybe it'll snow tomorrow and Theona and me get remarried, huh? No need to get hostile, Spoon. I'm just saying what I'm thinking while I'm sitting here waiting for you to cut my hair. Well, while you sitting there waiting on me to cut your hair, why don't you think about something useful, huh? Like how we gonna keep our shops? 'Cause I don't plan on losing everything that me and Theona didn't work so hard to build. Put our hearts and soul into everything we got. Here you go, Olivia, you're all set. - Wear it, love it, enjoy it. - Oh, I most certainly will. It is beautiful, you're a genius. Now, you're sure Shelby doesn't have this one? Oh, it's all one of a kind. Perfect, ah, she's gonna die. Yo, what's cracking, Rodney? What are you doing here, Dwayne? - I'm not buying your CDs. - Yo, it's Glock-9. And why ain't you, man, for reals, Rodney. Look man, I'm just out here every day, man, just trying to hustle to get my game off the ground, just like you, all right? Well look, I just saw you make some skrilla off the white lady, man. Why can't you help a young struggling black brother who's just trying to make ends meet? You dig? How much? $2.99 for one or it's $5 for three. - How about one? - Thank you, yeah. - It better be good. - What? It's gonna be better than good, man. - You know G9 can spit, man. - Yeah. Hey, you want two, one for your boyfriend? My father wanted a son that was gonna grow up to be a running back in the NFL. He used to call me sweet feet, but his son wanted to grow up to be a famous fashion designer on the runways of Paris. From then on, he just called me sweet, left me for my mom to raise me. How did you feel at the time? Actually, abandoned, hated, responsible. I felt like maybe there was something wrong with me. But there was nothing wrong with you. No, I was exactly what I was supposed to be, what I was made to be. And look, if he didn't understand that, then it's his fault, - it's his loss, you know? - I don't know. Are you just saying the words, Rodney, or do you really believe that? Yeah, because I'm gonna make it. - How can you be so sure? - 'Cause I'm good. - Yes. - And my dad is just gonna have to deal with the fact that I'm gonna buy my mom this beautiful mansion and he's not allowed in it, so. What do you know about having - a boyfriend? - Nothing. But, you know, I didn't think you was liking - females like that. - And how you know that? Well, I mean, whenever men make things for women, especially like this, a man's not gonna be - liking them like that. - Oh my goodness, okay, so, your, your, your small mindedness is so awesome. All right, well just know this, man. I'm never gonna forget that you supported me, man, for real. Even when I'm at the top. - Oh, oh my goodness. - I'm ghost. Hey stop, where'd you get that money? - It's mine. - And I'm asking you where you got it. - Selling CDs. - You got a receipt? - No, but I ain't done... - Stay there. - What's in the bag? - I ain't done nothing. That's what all the bad guys say. Stay there, don't move. Hey, hey, hey. stop. Help. Hey, stop, hey, stop, stop. Hey, you quit running right now or I swear to God, I'll shoot. What in the world? Just drop the bag, get on the ground now, face down. No, wait, I'll show you, Glock-9, Glock-9. Oh my god, what did you do, what did you do? Shots fired, request ambulance 9850 Liberty Street, young male, Black, suspect down. I thought he had a gun, why'd he run? Because he was afraid of being shot by a cop. Davis, go get some clean towels. Focus, go get some towels. I heard a gunshot, what happened? - He shot Dwayne. - Oh my god, oh my god, why? - For no good reason. - Why? No, God, I thought he had a gun... He didn't have a gun. Davis. The boy's the only - thing that matters. - He killed you, baby. - Can you just hang on? - I thought he had a gun. Did you call an ambulance? Gonna be a mess all the way around if that boy don't pull through. Papers say cop probably gonna be forced to resign, so at least that's something. Not gonna be enough if that boy don't make it. Theona still at the hospital? Ain't left his side since last night. She's a good woman, Theona. Don't know what's gonna happen on these streets if that boy don't pull through. Yeah. Killed right there, walking around... Black lives matter. - How is he? - Doctor says he's gonna make it, but I don't know. He's in a coma, still fighting. He'll be alright. I hope so, I sure hope so. Why didn't you just go home and get you some rest? I canceled all your customers and closed early. I didn't feel like being alone. Mind if I join you? - This is your church. - Hm. Wonder what God would say about that. He put you here, didn't He? That He did, Mr. Salgado, that He did. I hear that you make a pretty good priest. Well, I heard you make a pretty good bartender. - You busy? - Hey, Angelica. - Come on in, have a seat. - It'll just take a minute. I wanted to thank you for what you did for my father. Oh, no, I just made a phone call for - a friend and neighbor. - You did more than that. We were treated very well. Good. My father's feeling hopeful. And, if for no other reason, I thank you for that. Whatever I can do to help. No matter how things turn out, I think it was a good thing you came here. - Thank you for saying that. - Just wanted you to know. Bye. What you think, should we give this a try? Wait, what, that's it? That's it? What, you're just gonna leave as if we're nothing? Grant, we were never really anything. What are you gonna do without me, LaTrice? Oh, everything. I done that for you already. Well, you missed a couple spots. You were always better with the broom than a mop and you're not that great with a mop. Guess I am better at making a mess than cleaning up one. I just wish that somehow I knew that everything was gonna be all right.
