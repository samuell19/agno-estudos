We're all a little bit edgy after last night. - Oh I heard about that. Can you believe it, hooded riders. Somebody's been watching too many late movies. Anything I can do to help, Ben? - No Honey, but it was nice of you to ask. That's what neighbors are for, besides I have a special interest here. Ben, you sure you can trust him? - Frankly, no.

I hope this trip isn't a mistake. - Where there's men, money, and action it's never a mistake. - She meant that Brewster's just another rich old man. - But some rich older men are lots of fun. It depends what angle you view it from. Horizontal or vertical. - A lady never tells, at least that's what the ladies tell me. - [Man] Miss. - Well, I once knew rich old men in Miami. $1,000 a month penthouse, four cars, and he didn't even charge me and my girlfriend any rent. - And he treated you like a father. - But how do you know? He had me call him daddy. - And I bet only wanted to do was to spank you. - Oh, you know him too, huh? - Well say Debbie, what's the story on this? - You know, it's like the free trips to Vegas.

I run a tight ship so I want you to learn them. Memorize them. - I'll wash out for sure. - One more thing, very, very important. You're not in business for yourself, so there's not to be any wallet boosting and there's not to be any con about your sick kids, and you're not to pry into the personal lives of the customers. This is the class operation and I'm paying you top dollar. And I want you to make sure that the customer wants to come back. Now our motto is you tease them, you please them and I fleece them.
