Subtitles by explosiveskull Here, get some dirt on that shovel. This wasn't how it was supposed to go down. This wasn't the plan. We did our part! You both gotta calm down. Nobody got hurt! That was the agreement! No, you changed the plan on him! Nobody got hurt! That was the deal! I don't wanna spend the rest of my life looking over my shoulder! This was the only way we were gonna get back what they stole from us! Now speed it up or we're not gonna make our window! Who are those guys? I don't know. That's not them, though. I don't like this. Play it cool. I'll handle this. Keep your eyes on the woods, boys. Mac, stay back till we call you. Who the hell are you? Never mind that. Where's the money? Here you go. Where's the rest of it? We took our share. That's your cut. Truby, Foster, let's go. That wasn't the deal. Not now, Mac. Yeah, well, it is now. - That's gotta be less than half. - Come on. - You're damn right it's less than half. - Let's go. Twenty million split four ways. Three of us pulled the job. Five million apiece. The rest is yours. Any one of those bills could've been marked. How do you expect to launder it? Let us worry about it. Whoa, whoa, whoa, relax. Where's our money, asshole? Easy, guys. - Where's the money? - Calm down, all right? We buried the money. You kill us, nobody gets anything. - Just calm down, everybody. - He's bluffing. Just relax. This isn't the plan. You're right. It isn't part of the plan. - Truby, Foster, get in the goddamn truck! - Look. Mac, relax. - Everybody relax. Put the guns away. - Put the guns away. - Everybody just relax! - We want the money! Where's our money? Calm down! Money! Shit. Move, move, move, move! Check the truck! Go, go, go! Fuck. Son of a bitch! Come on! Get out of there! We gotta get out of here! Let's get out of here. How far are we from the primary crime scene? They're walking it now, but it looks like it's less than two miles if he cut his way through the marsh. Can we get a flyover? Not before the weather. Sykes. What time did the call come in? Approximately 9:30 this morning. I don't see any brass. Any exchange of fire? Well, apparently this one here, two others that were discovered by a couple of hunters over on Route 20. Got themselves into one hell of a firefight. We recovered over two dozen spent shell casings. The first responding officers tracked him here. Got IDs? So far, we know this one to be Donovan MacDonald. The other two are Ike Foster and John Truby. John Truby. Mr. Truby had a security badge from Central City Bank. Hmm. The bank that got robbed downtown yesterday. So what's our chances of getting anything out of this guy here? Spotty at best. - The paramedics gave him 50/50 when they got here. - Hmm. Hey, I need you guys to get him down to the trauma center, all right? - Yes, sir. - And no one talks to this guy, except with me. All right. That's it. Have a nice trip. Law enforcement officials are following several leads in what authorities are calling one of the largest bank robberies in state history. Over 20 million was stolen from Central City Bank in the morning hours of Monday, April 8th. Ike Foster and John Truby died at the scene. The third subject, Donovan MacDonald, remains in a coma, following injuries sustained during the robbery. At the press conference earlier today, Captain Stover of Metropolitan Police Department released updated information regarding the alleged suspects. Our Major Crimes Unit is investigating multiple lead. Our preliminary results indicated that one of the suspects, John Trub, was employed by the security firm that was contracted at Central City Bank. We're still reviewing those findings with our partners in the FBI. We don't wanna jump the gun till we have more definite details. Next question. As I stated earlier, this is only our preliminary investigation. We're still interviewing witnesses and coordinating our efforts with our partners in the federl law enforcement communities. It is our belief that the individuals involved may have, in fact, planned to assassinate him all along. I am certain that our associates with the FI will have more to comment. - Still having migraines? - Yeah. How often? All the time. Follow the tip of my finger with your eyes. What about the nightmares? Yeah. How often? Every night. Don't you think it's in his best interest to extend his evaluation period at least until his long-term memory comes back? That's not my concern. I don't know who you were before all this happened, but maybe it's for the best if you don't get those memories back. And lives were lost. Do you really wanna know why? Well, if I have to go to prison... I'd like to know why. What about his follow-up? It's out of my hands. Make sure he stays on the prescribed regimen. Yes, Doctor. Thank you. - How's it going today? - Good. Hmm. Looks good. You're sure this is edible, right? Seemed fine the other day. Ah. Great. Hey, I'm Lucas. Just got in. Got? Excuse me? You said, "got." Yeah. People don't get in here. They're sent here. Yeah, well, a 72-hour psychiatric evaluation. It's voluntary. Do I know you? You seem... familiar. No, you don't know me, but I know you. How's that? Read all about you. Saw all those news stories about you and that bank robbery. Well, then you know more about it than I do. Ah. Well, I know that you're not guilty. At least not for everything they're accusing you for. How long you been here? What, a couple years? Seven years. I bet you're missing life outside these walls. I'd bet even more that you're desperate to get out. What's that? What if I told you I can get you out of here? I'd say you're crazy. You mean to tell me, after all this time you've spent in here, you can't tell the difference between these nut jobs and me? Damn, I'm good. How would you get me out of this place? As much as I'd like to take credit for all of this, I got some help. Why are you doing this? I got 20 million reasons. If you read my case, you'd know that I don't have any memory of what happened to me before I was sent to this place. Look, you wanna get out of here, this is your chance. I'd say sleep on it, but I'm being discharged tonight, so you gotta make a decision quick 'cause the clock is ticking. Trust me. Why would I trust you? You got any better options? Lunch is over, gentlemen! And Dr. Nichols is waiting on you for your exit exam. Let's go. - Yeah. - Let's go. Everything's gonna be all right. See you soon, Mac. Mac, how are you feeling? Like I was poisoned. The side effects will only last a few hours. Here, take this. It will help calm you down. - You done for the day? - Uh, just finishing out the week. Go ahead and sign this. I'm gonna have to have you open up that bag for me. Certainly. Ladies, can I see your IDs, please? Just returning these to County. Uh, Dr. Nichols signed off on it. Let's get you to open up the back as well. Okay, give me a second. Can we hurry this up? Come on. Dr. Coda to the ECT room. Dr. Coda to the ECT room. Lights out, guys. Hey, did MacDonald get moved back to his room? Not that I'm aware of. Let's go! Move it along! Damn it. We got a problem, guys. Man. Alicia, what did I say? Such an asshole. You're good to go. - Hey. - Hey, yourself. All right. You still think I'm crazy? Mm-hmm. Come on, let's get you inside. It's fairly catastrophic retrograde amnesia. You think it was real, or do you think he was faking it? I believe it was real. His brain imaging says it was real. Every neurological test we've ever done said it was real. Detective, this was the worst case I've seen. It took him six months to learn how to walk again and another 12 just to learn how to speak. - Hmm. - The man's lucky to have survived. Let me ask you something. If it wasn't an act, how did he get out of this place? Has he have any visitors lately? I've been here four years, and other than police investigators and the occasional reporter, no one's come calling. Yeah? Just spoke to one of the night nurses. She said a security guard by the name of Farren Dell was a no-call, no-show for work this morning. He was also one of the last people to have spoken to MacDonald. Head over to his place and tell me if you find anything. Okay. No more questions. Police are following several leads in the escape of famed bank robber Donovan MacDonald. Authorities are not speculating how they believe MacDonald got away, but are pursuing leads in a person of interest... You'll need this. Our Karen Matthews is on the scene. What do you know about your case, Mac? I've been asked a lot of questions over the years, but... And it always seems like they're talking about someone else. I've been accused of a lot of things. I'd like to know the truth. We can help you with that. This will help you relax before we begin. Before we begin what? There's somebody outside. Keep him here. Get in here. Were you followed? I left behind a few bread crumbs. Hey, Mac. You already know Farren. Uh, okay. Obviously, you guys know who I am. Who are you? You're not a security guard. - You're not... - Crazy? Are you a nurse? I was in a former life. How fast can we do this? Do what? Why don't you come with me, Mac? Let's go upstairs. - Now, hold on a minute. - No, no, no. - No. - Come on. - Listen... - Come on. Let me show you something, Mac. Well, most of this is public record. But this? This is the important stuff. And according to the police report, the lead detective was a guy by the name of... Sykes. I know him. He's been coming to the hospital for years. Always asking me questions. Sounds about right. This is something you might be interested in. The ballistics report... which clearly indicates that the bullets that killed Ike Foster and John Truby... weren't fired by any of the weapons recovered at the scene. So you tell me. How does that happen? Well, if I didn't kill 'em, who did? We've got reports coming in from the state troopers. They've set up roadblocks and checkpoints at state line and the 95. All right, get it on the board. Okay, we've got another hit from a gas station attendant that thinks they spotted what looks like a cargo van headed southbound on Veterans Highway to the 204. That makes no sense. They'd be over by Hunter Airfield. You're scrambling your resources too thin. By our estimates, this guy's already got a massive head start. Detective, I am sure you know FBI Agent Franks, and this is his new partner, Karl Hicks. We already extended our perimeter out 20 miles. What else would you have in mind? And I thought the marshals were responsible for fugitive capture. And you've had seven years to solve these homicides, but you got nothing. So now that the primary suspect is out, it lands on my desk. Yeah, you know, that's gonna fit in perfectly with all the evidence you haven't given our team. Captain, I expect your department's full cooperation. I've already spoken to your special agent in charge. What you know about Central City Bank could provide the missing details that ties our cold case together. You two have been working opposite ends of the same case for years. You want our cooperation, we'll expect full transparency. You'll have it. Detective? Look, the briefing we got before we headed over here was limited at best. You're the specialist on this one. I need to know who we're going after. Is he really nuts? You ever think about that? Is this guy really crazy, or is he putting us on? Well, seven years is a hell of a long time to wait and play a game. All three of these guys lived here most of their lives. Then again, you already know that, right? You know more about them... than we do. Hmm. The bank they robbed... we were told the FBI was investigating them for fraud. That's right. So what were you looking for? Okay. It seems the owners of the cement factory took out a $30 million line of credit with their friends over at Central City Bank, while using the employee pension funds as collateral. And before filing for bankruptcy, they took annual bonuses in excess of $24 million, leaving the people who built that company... high and dry. You've known about this all along? Our forensic accountants took over two years looking through their books. Couldn't prove a damn thing. It was all handshakes and gentleman's agreements. The bank knew exactly what they were doing, but they turned a blind eye to it because... their money was covered. But without proof, there was no indictment. This is an LPT enhancer. A what? A drug that stimulates the frontal lobe of the brain, which controls memory. Look, I've been stuck with every truth serum and memory enhancer ever invented. Not this one. How do you figure? Because it just finished clinical trials. Over 80% of the patients who took this regained almost 40% of their memory. What happened to the other 20%? They died. Look, I have no recollection of what happened to me in my past, and I'm not gonna let you guys fry my brain, trying to figure it out. There is $20 million in cash hidden out there, and we believe that you know where it's stashed, and we're not the only ones looking for it, so if you wanna survive the next couple of days, I suggest you start working with us! Hey! There's an 80% chance this stuff will work? Yes. What are the side effects? Oh... Go ahead. Tell him. It's not going to be pleasant. Dizziness, vertigo, possible hallucinations, and those headaches of yours are gonna get much, much worse. Good news is... you remember where you buried the money, and we all prosper. This doesn't work by itself. We're going to have to expose you to some places from your past. So you think this is gonna release my memories? It takes about 15 minutes to start working. Okay. I'm gonna need you to remain incredibly still. You're gonna wanna bite down on this. Trust me. It has to be injected directly... into your spinal fluid. Hold him down. - - Mac, I'm sorry. This is gonna hurt like hell. - Hold him. - Hey, hey, hey! Just relax. Breathe. Breathe. - You guys have been busy. - Yeah. Who's this? A hunch. All of this is still speculation. - Let's be clear about that. - Right. None of the weapons used at the crime scene match the ballistics. Someone else had to be involved. How many people worked at this place before they closed their doors? About 115. A hundred and fifteen. I'm sure that doesn't include contractors or guys like Foster, whose businesses depended upon this place, right? Yeah. Well, there's your fourth man right there, Detective. Every one of those people had a motive, just like MacDonald. We gotta get him up. - Come on. - Wait! - Stand up, Mac. - Wait. - Come on, stand up. - Easy. You can't push him like this, Farren. Stopping every 10 minutes isn't gonna cut it, not with the window we have. - Wait! Wait! - Come on. I know... I know this place. Wait. I've been here before. What are you seeing, Mac? Fragments. All I see is fragments. Fragments. Fragments. I see in fragments. Why do I know this place? Wait. Where are we? You guys need to speed this up. What did she just tell you? You can't fast-track this. - Give him another shot. - Farren! It could kill him. Do you really wanna waste the last six years of your life? Ah, shit. Get him inside now. Come on. Get him in. Come on, come on! Get him in now! Hurry! - Come on, Mac. - Come on. Stay with me. - I know this place. - It's the police. Keep him quiet. Shit. I know this place. All right, follow my lead. Come on. That's why I told him they're asking too much. I've read the inspection. No, they're out of their minds if they think they're getting that much for the auction. How you doing, sir? Hey, can I call you back? Yeah. - Can you hang up the phone? - Yes, sir. - Afternoon, Officer. - Afternoon. You got business here? This is private property. Place has already been foreclosed. You told me the title was clear. It is. I'm sorry, sir. Uh... I was... I was only out here because the bank had listed it for auction. You say you're out here looking at buying this property? Yes, sir. I need a place to run my horses. Shh... Keep your head down. Shh... Call me crazy, but I had a mind to renovate it... back to its old, beautiful self. Really? How 'bout you show me some ID? Yeah. Come on. How 'bout that ID? Keep it quiet. 348, go ahead. Give me a second. 348, I copy. You can show me en route. Folks, I gotta clear. Like I said, this is private property. Have the proper documentation if you're gonna be here. Yes, sir. Calm down. Come on. Gotta get you up. Come on, get up. Come on, come on. All right, sit down, sit down. Jesus Christ. He just lost his shit up there. - It's okay. - He just freaked the hell out. It's all right. Just breathe through it. It took everything I had to hold him down. Everything's gonna be all right. I know this place. You used to live here. That's why we brought you here. It's working. Why don't you get the equipment? I'll meet you at the truck. All right, Mac, let's get you out of here. Come on. Everything's in range. His vitals are good. - Keep him talking. - Just focus. What is this place? One of the men who died in the shoot-out used to work here. You were talking this whole time, Mac. You brought us here. Every cop in the state is looking for us. Why are we wasting our time with this bullshit? It has to have some order to it. He's rebuilding the story of his past. I don't trust this guy. I don't trust him either. It was someone else. Oh. Is it somebody you worked with? Maybe someone that worked here? Truby. Truby was working with someone. He's the one that's gonna help us get away clean. He was gonna cover our tracks. How long can you survive on unemployment? Huh? What about you? You gonna go back to towing barges? Is that what you want? This is fucking crazy. This is all we have right now, guys. He's gonna meet us here later tonight. Stay with it, Mac. That guy is not coming anywhere near my place. You can trust him, all right? He's not coming here! You can trust him! He's the one that told me about our pensions. Where's the money? I don't know where the money is! My eyes. Can't you give me something for the pain? Not without negative side effects. It was by the water. A river. It was by a river, and there was... cement towers. There were cement towers by a river. I got it. Give me the keys. Grab him now. Let's go. I got him. Come on. I got him. I got him. - Let's go! - You're okay, Mac. Seven years ago, we had the most violent attack this city has ever seen. And the only thing we had going were the leads that we publicized. We're gonna be working with the FBI. Stay sharp. These guys will kill for what they're after. Now go. Stay sharp. - Excuse me. - I mean it. Pretty powerful statement. You said you just leaked information to the press. You lied. Don't worry about it. Look, I need you to push these checkpoints out. Get the word out to Transit Authority... Franks. I need you in my office. Excuse me. Jesus. What a fucking mess. Carter. Carter, you get any hits on the security guard? It looks like he stole the identification from the real Farren Dell, who died in a car crash last April in Atlanta. I got the techs dusting for prints right now, but it looks like he wiped this place clean before he left. You guys get anything yet? Nothing. All right, I was gonna head back to the hospital after this. I got them running background checks on all the employees who had contact with MacDonald. Remember that old cement factory he used to work at? Yeah, we combed through that place for months. Didn't find a damn thing. Maybe we weren't looking in the right place. You see something, you call me. Okay. You guys let me know the minute you find something, - all right? - Okay. Come on, Mac. Something happened here. - Should I go help him? - No. If we step between him and his past, it could fragment the imagery. Let him stay with it. Grab him. Let's get him inside. - Come on, Mac. - Stay with it. Come on. Let's go. Hold on. It's too much on him. Right over there. Let's go. He needs to sit down. Come on. Let me sit him down. Come on, Mac. Right here, right here. Sit down. I need you to keep your eyes closed for a few minutes. Come on. Sit up gently, gently, gently. You spent most of your life here, Mac, sometimes six days out of the week. You used to work right in there. Take this. Let's go. There. We came in through there. Up the steps? I'll lead the way. There. Oh, shit! Shit. Give me the bag. It's so real. It can't be up here. All the reports said you buried it. No. Give me the other bag. No. No. Give me the shovel. We were never gonna bury it. We sent it down one of these conveyor belts. It's gotta be in one of those silos. Let's go. You're with me. Come on. You take this side. I'll take this side. Yeah. You got anything? Nothing! It's gotta be down here. Nah, this place is empty. What do you got? Anything? Still nothing, man. Keep looking. Got one more, come on. It's down here, I know it. I got nothing. Me either. There's no money here. Junkyard. You see that there? Yeah. No, no, no, no, no. What are you looking at? If they threw those bags on the conveyor belt, they wouldn't have fed into the silos unless it was operational. Yeah, that's right. What does it connect to? The conveyor... connects to a dumping bin. There's something in there. Here, grab this bar. Farren, there's a cop out there. Farren! Grab him, grab him! - Come on, come on. - Keep him out of sight! No, there's someone from law enforcement. Keep him quiet and out of sight, hear me? - Whoever that is... - Get him in! He's gonna kill us. He's gonna kill us! He's the one that's gonna help us get away clean. Why would we involve a cop? They're trying to kill us! No. It's gonna be all right. What? What did you say? Do I know you? Do you? Are you a nurse? I was in a former life. Everything's gonna be all right. Everything's gonna be all right. You're not a security guard. Dad, if we get your gear, we might have some daylight left. - Let's ride. - Go! I had a family. Why didn't you tell me? Why didn't you tell me? Those trials I told you about, the patients that didn't regain their memories thought it was all fake and planted. They refused to believe in it. This was the only way that would've worked. This... this is all my fault. Fuck. So what are you saying? Come on, what do you got? I thought you said we were clear of the locals. How many are there? We only have the one. Call 911. Give them some bullshit site far away from there. We might be in business. 911. What's your emergency? Uh, yeah, I think my wife and I just saw the guy that you're looking for. The one that escaped. Okay, sir. Just stay calm and don't hang up. Can you provide me with your... Are you sure? Agent Franks, we got a confirmed sighting in Brunswick. Brunswick? That's a hell of a lot farther out than we thought. Yeah, it's at least 60 miles south of here. What's the area like down there? Waterways, mostly. Interconnected islands. Send somebody. Hurry. Sir, just stay on the line... All right. Captain, we've seen this before. If we don't get a net around him now, there are thousands of escape routes across those shipping lines. Dispatch lost connection with the caller. I'm coming with you. No, Detective, I need you to be my eyes and ears here. Look out for the locals and give me their exact location. Let's go. Metro Police! If you are in this facility, you are trespassing! I need you to come out where I can see you! Talk to me, Carter. Yeah, either we got a few well-off transients who are camping out for the night, or your hunch might be right. You want me to call it in? I'm on my way. Copy that. Those people, they've come for the money. That's the only thing they want. If they get it... we're dead. Let's get to it first. Go and get Farren. - Get him! Bring him back! - Okay. After you, Pops. That's it. I say again, this is Metro Police! Come out and show yourselves! I'm here. Hands in the air! Do not move! Who else is here? Just me. Bullshit. I see three packs. Where's the rest of them? I'm not gonna ask you again! Where's the rest of them? I'm right here. Right here. I'm pretty sure I'm the one you're looking for. Dell? Farren Dell? Get in where I can see you. She had nothing to do with it. Nothing. - Where's MacDonald? - He's gone. - What do you mean? - We buried him yesterday. Just keep your hands up in the air. Carter, are you there? I got a couple of them standing right here in front of me. You were right. They were here the whole damn time. I'm ten minutes out. I need you to roll everyone in the area... Get back! Get back! Carter, you there? Come on, now. Ready? Okay. Farren! Farren! Farren! Farren! I remember. I remember. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. In here, in here. Go get the money! Go! It's the only thing keeping us alive! I've got you covered. I've got you covered. All right, move! Let's go, let's go! Right through, right through! Freeze! Freeze! Show me your hands! - Show me your hands! - We're not armed! Get them out here! Get up, come on. Let's go. Bring them here. Right here. Where is he? Where's Mac? Congratulations, Mac! We must've swept this place a dozen times, couldn't find a damn thing. Nothing! Not a sign where you stashed it. Come on out, Mac! Come on! Let's work this out. Like we did last time? We had a deal, and you broke it! That's not the way I remember it. You killed Truby and Foster! That's because they didn't stick to our plan! You were never gonna stick to our plan! I was the one taking all the risks, Mac. That money needed to be laundered. Every one of those bills could've been marked. Every serial number could've been tracked back to us. You didn't think about that, did you? No one was supposed to get killed. All right, enough talking! You come out now, and I won't kill you, too! You can't kill me! I died seven years ago. What I did, I did for my family! I'm sure you did. You planned on killing us all along! That's right. I should've put another bullet through your head! Give me the money! I'll give you the money... but it's a new deal. You let my wife and my son go, and I'll give it all to you, all 15 million. No, not that simple anymore, Mac! You exposed us! That puts me and the rest of my guys at risk. That's not gonna happen. Franks! You set these people up! That's right! It's called deception. Listen. We gotta get to Dad. Here it is, Franks! Come and get it! There you go. It's all yours. I heard the whole thing. Seven years you served. Good enough. We'll call that time served. This money cost me my son's life. I'm sorry about that, but I'm sure it'll get you where you wanna go. Where could I possibly go I wouldn't be spending the rest of my life looking over my shoulder? I'll take care of it. And my son? I'll take care of that too. Thank you, Detective. Subtitles by explosiveskull
