(silence) (electronic music) (woman moaning) - The Canadians just got a shipment in, should make a few Gs off the load this week, you wanna go to Vegas? - Why don't you put that down on a ring? - Do I finally get to do that thing to you that we talked about? - No shot. - Well, what's in it for me then? - There's a lot that I can do. - Like what? (phone buzzing) - I won't make fun of your shitty comic books and I'll watch all the stupid werewolf movies that you like and my love and affection. (phone buzzing) - [Man] You're gonna need to work on your sales pitch. - You need to lock this up, I'm a fucking 11. (knocking on door) - [Bearded Man] What the fuck happened to you? - Really? Bro, I'm out here working my fucking balls off for you. I'm getting my ass kicked by hooligans. I'm fucking banging your leftovers making sure your future kids don't have to work in a glue factory, and this is how you're gonna treat me, really? It's nice, real nice. - You've got my money? - You got any coke? (men laughing) (man groans) - Watch it. - Ooh, sorry. - Watch it, my ribs. - You all right? - My face, I'm all fucked up. - Yeah, it looks fine, please get in, you're scaring all the kids, come on. - Fuck it. (snorting) That's good. You know who I saw the other day? Lizzie. - Buttaface Lizzie? - Yeah. I saw her at the gas station on Newbridge. I took her home. - Bullshit. - I swear to God, I had to, it was payback. - Payback for what? - For what? - Remember you used to lift candy and sell it at recess and those junior high douchebags tried to shake you down, Lizzie's older brother beat you up real fucking good. - It wasn't that bad. - Oh, I'm sorry, who saved your ass again? Alex, thank you. - You caved her older brother's leg in with a bat. - Oh, I fucking did, you fucking cocksucker. Piece of shit! That was good, that was fucking good. - But how was that payback? - I don't know, I don't fucking know, I creampied the bitch, though. - She does have a sick body. - [Both] But her face! (chuckling) - [Alex] That's funny. - So, let me get this straight. You hired a crew to beat the shit out of you, this other guy, and rob 40 pounds of your own weed that you were gonna sell him and his cash. - I didn't rob anybody. I got this asshole convinced he's the reason why we got jacked. - It's definitely believable. Your face looks lumped meat. - I know right, fucking kills too. Jay, you should've seen this fucking kid beg, it was priceless. Nerd didn't even know what hit him. - I spotted your product two weeks ago, Alex. What the hell happened with that money? - I came up short with a bookie. What, I needed to get your paper back, right? - How short? That was 85 Gs worth of shit. - [Alex] It was nothing, it was like 40 grand. - You fucking degenerate. - What am I supposed to do? It's all there, you counted it. What the fuck you want from me? - Look at me. If you ever use my product again to pay off a debt, you're out. - Bro, I am done gambling, that was the last time, I swear. Front me some product and I will move it quick as long as it's good shit. - Who is this dude that you robbed? Does he have any muscle? - No, I told you, he's a nobody, he's a fucking nobody. He's a fucking skinny rich kid who's trying to be a fucking hustler, fuck him. - Never a dull moment. - Not with me. (rock music) - You're a piece of work, you know that? You had one task, why the fuck weren't you there? - If I go up north, who's gonna fix the cars? - The load on that flatbed is worth six figures. - I got a yard full of repairs. Don't forget the boys have football practice tonight. - [Jay] What's up, Shorty? - Never get fucking married, that's what's up. - Marriage is bliss, eh? - I know you didn't come here for a chinwag about relationships. - I need 150 more high-end spark plugs. - You still owe against the last job and the figures are running. - I know. Listen. I've got 85, that just about covers the principal, now I can turn this load around quick and we all win. - I got a hundred for ya, but the border's getting tougher, 3,500 for the sour, 26 for the jacks. - Fucking hell. Come on, Charlie, the margins are slim as is. - Hey. You wanna transpo this shit from up north? We take the fucking risk bringing product down to this suckhole. It's dryer than a crank whore's snatch out there, the price went up. - What's the breakdown? - 35 pounds of sour, 65 jacks. - Most of my guys can't move the jacks, they're shit. - You don't want 'em, there's another asshole out there does. (electronic music) - Straight robbing you, kid. - Gotta take a few rounds in the chin while I sort out a new connect. - Jesus. Well, no fucking delt workout today. Shit. Yeah, I'm taking my sour before these raggedy-ass shitbirds, I promise you that. Smells like money. You know, I saw Alice this morning. Yo, kid, that chick has a serious set of lungs on her. - I thought you were kicking it with Kat? - I banged her last night. She lets me put it in her ass, so I keep her in the back pocket. - Please tell me you didn't kiss that mouth afterwards. - I turned her face into a Van Gogh, it was beautiful. - You're a sick freak. - What, you're telling me Vic don't let you do that? - Come on, bro. That's the future mother of my children. (pounding music) Business ain't what it used to be, we can't just dump anything onto the streets anymore. - Have you seen the ass clowns that work for you? - Yo, Charlie, you needs to get you more sour. - The Canadians can eat a dick. On top of them raping me, they make even more money on the currency exchange. - My boy has a pipeline of moon rock, pure MDMA is on fire right now, kid, cash on delivery, too. - Don't go there. That's not a slap on the wrist. - Slinging molly is a next-level risk. I'd rather not spend my good looking years in jail. - Come on, boss. Men grow old gracefully, women rot. - Eat a dick, Petey. - Well, you should've brought that for lunch, we could've had that, I'd eat a whole bucket of dicks. (phone ringing) - [Voicemail] You have reached-- - [Alex] Alex, hello? (beep) - Yo, Alex. Spark plugs came in, where you at, motherfucker? - You look shredded, kid, you getting ready for opening weekend in Vegas? - Just training with BK. - You stepping in the cage? - I need to see some paper towards the old bill, Ricky. - These prices are killing me, Jay. I could get a real fucking job and make more money. - You could also be sucking dick behind Benito's taco shop. - Shit, it pays better. - Who else is gonna spot a jerkoff like you 30 pounds? - Right. - Next week. I want every penny. - I got you, kid. Good looking. (energetic music) - Left-right hook. Punch. Punch. Double. Feet. Not bad. Two. Two. Two. Feet. - [Bald Man] Cut the music. - On your feet. (music stops) - What's up, BK? - Man, you better get your mind right 'cause shit is about to pop off. - What are you talking about? - Man, that was just a courtesy call. That dude, your man, Alex, hit was connected. There's money coming in from that pale nigga Vuk. - That wasn't me. - Well, a boatload of Serbians are on their way to your house. - Fuck. When? - Now. - How the fuck do they know where I live? - You better smarten up, Jay. Somebody got hands in your cookie jar. Somebody inside your crew been snitching. You and me go back a minute, so I'ma reach out, try to mediate this thing, aight? - Thanks, BK. (suspenseful music) - [Woman] Hey, you reached Victoria, leave me a message. - Fuck. Victoria! Vic! Vic! Get the fuck up! - Whoa, Jay, what the fuck is going on? - Put this on. - God, you coming in here like a Spic at the end of the month! What the fuck is this jacket for? - Just put it on! - All right. Fuck, I gotta work in two hours. - You're going to your mother's, let's go. - What are you talking about, I'm going to my mother's? You're all wet. What the fuck, is it raining outside? - I need you to stop fucking talking. - Hey. Are you gonna tell me what the fuck is going on, hm? - Just trust me. Don't go anywhere. Don't speak to anyone, just lay low. - Hey, I gotta work. I gotta go to work. - Take a sick day. - What are you talking about? Jay, what are you talking about? Are you serious? - Yes, I'm fucking serious. Just get the fuck outta here! (metal clanking) Alex, open the fucking door. - [Voicemail] You have reached-- - [Alex] Alex, hello. - [Voicemail] The mailbox is full, goodbye. - Don't get old, Jay. I gotta take a pill to sleep, antacid to eat, blue pill to fuck, and my coffee taste like shit 'cause I'm lactose intolerant. - Come on, man. What he say? - He ain't say much. Nigga not running for office anytime soon and you know me, that meant something. Told him you was connected to the Canadians, that meant something else. - How much slack did it buy me? - A inch. He wanna meet you. - Can't wait. When and where? - One o'clock today, barbershop in Ridgewood. - He gonna kill me? - Well, it is enemy territory. Off the main road. Noisy, but not crowded. Easy access to parkways. Now, these Serbians is nuts, Jay. Cold. And I know you're a tough dude and all that, but you don't wanna tussle 'cause they gon' kill you, murk Vic, then they gonna rape your dead bodies. So, keep your head, take this meet, and see what he says. - I can't even think about a battle. My paper's all in the street. - And this shit between you and Alex has-- - I've got nothing to do with it. - What you mean you ain't got nothing to do with it? Let me tell you something. Alex is bad news. Always has been. And that's on you. - [Petey] What's up with your piece? - It's registered. This is clean? - As a whistle. Niggas in the Bronx filed off the serial numbers. - All right. Thanks, Petey. - And you sure you don't need me with you? - Grab Vic. Make sure she's whole and take her back to my place. - All right. Give 'em hell. (intense music) - You Vuk? - And you... must be Jason. Yes? The mover bought you face time, make it count. - I didn't call the shot on that hit. (speaking in foreign language) - Word is you just took a shipment from the Canadians. - Alex moves weed for me, but I didn't put him to it. - Oh, I believe you, that's why you're not a ghost. - So, what are we gonna do? (chuckling) (speaking in foreign language) - We aren't gonna do anything. You are taking over the debt. - I don't have 120 in paper. (speaking in foreign language) - 150. A hassle tax, I want it by Sunday. - [Jay] I can't-- - And my friend here, Nikola, likes your girl. Pretty thing. Tight body. Works as a dancer at the um-- (snaps fingers) (speaking in foreign language) - [Nikola] Sweet Disposition. - Sweet Disposition, yeah? - You'll get what's owed. - You go now. I have a very busy day. - [Petey] You want people come visit you? Make friends with some fucking hipsters, right? - [Victoria] Call 'em what they are, fucking pussies. - [Jay] Put the word out, Petey, I'm looking for this motherfucker. - You're okay? - Alex? Yo, kid dipped, no one seen or heard from him. (smack) - What the fuck, Victoria? - Don't you ever treat me like some dime store hooker again. - All right. Okay. I'm fine, thanks for asking. - [Petey] Yo, what exactly did they say? - Debt's on me, 150. - I thought the number was 120. - Due by Sunday. - Who the fuck is this guy? Who gives a fuck about Queens anyway? - Seriously, I mean, if it floated away tomorrow, I wouldn't give a shit. - These dudes are Serbians, they will whack you, me, our goddamn pets, and not bat an eye. - I ain't fucking heard of Serbia. - I've heard of it, just didn't think it was a real place. (snorting) That's not coke. - Nah, some good tina, though. - Son of a bitch. - I always knew that faggot was gonna fuck you over, he uses you 'cause you grew up together, he takes advantage of your generosity. - All right, fuck, Victoria, I get it. - How the fuck are we gonna come up with 150 grand? - [Petey] How much you got on the street? - I barely have that much in the wheel. - And most of that just went out. - I got seven grand saved. - No fucking way. Not an option. - We could rob someone. - We collect. (plane roaring) - Do you like Big Bird? - Sure. He's okay. - He's my favorite, wanna watch him? - Vanessa, just watch your show, and don't talk shit to Jay. - Damn, girl, you're looking fine. You still dancing? - You know I'm a pediatric nurse now, Jay, come on with that. Speedy, talk to your boy. - He's just calling like he see 'em, baby. - Is that right? - With yo sexy ass. (Speedy chuckling) - I don't trust either of you. - Yo, my boy owes me 15 stacks, just gotta go pick it up. Let's ride. Fucking hot for April, B. You won't catch me complaining about global warming. - Global warming? Yo, man, what are you on right now? - Just trying to kick some knowledge, B. - You got knowledge? Let's hear it. Enlighten me. - Your man, Ricky. My girl says she seen him ride around in a brand new Range. - How many guys you know doing what we do that don't live nigga rich? - True. What car did he have when he picked up the last load? Word is he's using his money to spread his wings. Worked for Papadakis. (door creaking) (tv blaring) What's good, Papi? - Hey, there, Speedy. - [Speedy] You got that package I called about? - You want a line? (speaking Spanish) (all speaking Spanish) - It's for the trees, my nigga. - You called that in? - Yeah! (speaking Spanish) (laughing) Those dudes are crazy, man. - Yo, yo, gravy, Diego. - It's all gravy, Papi. - Yo, Osner, good looking out, my man. (speaking Spanish) See you, Conchita. Jay, you comin'? - What was that? - Told you straight, right? - Straight? You bring me to a Mexican fucking standoff? - Yo, we Dominican, aight? - You're my ace, but don't ever bring me here again. (rock and roll music) Mutz around? - Yeah, let me get him for you. - Look at these questionable motherfuckers. Take a break, darling. - Damn, girl, take your time. I got a roll of duct tape with her name on it. - You know, everything's got a price tag. - We didn't come to talk about the muff that works here. You owe me 67 large, Mutz. - I'm not a magician. Yo, even addicts got bills. - I need it, you know why. - All right, all right. (register whirring) - Look, whatever's in the register, I mean, that's... That's all I have right now. - Bullshit, Mutz, you owe me a lot of money, where is it? - It's out there, man. - It's fucking dry out there and you've got product. - No, he got the sour, man. - Look at you. You got this sun business, you're fucking flying. - How can I turn a profit when all yous are coming to my salon, you turn it into your own personal fucking whorehouse, I don't say nothing about it. - What's that supposed to mean? - Nothing. Doesn't mean nothing. - Sounds like this cunt's threatening you. - Whoa, it wasn't a threat. Jay, why would I do that? I would never say nothing to Vic. - Ow. Fuck. You broke my nose. - Damn it, Mutz. You're all right, let me see. It's not broken. - Yo, harden the fuck up. - Petey, wait outside. (Mutz whimpering) - Bro, tilt your head back. - Get the fuck off, don't touch me. - That mouth of yours. - That spilled milk bitch is full of shit, he's got real cash. - What's he have, like 2k worth? It's not worth raking him over the coals, not yet. - It is short notice. - Grab Ricky, bring him to the bar. I'll be there in an hour. - What if he don't wanna come? - Make him. Take Speedy, he snitched, have him muscle Ricky around. - Hey, where you going? (otherworldly music) - Be the wolf. Be the wolf. Be the wolf. (door thuds) - [Ricky] My man, phone don't work? - What the fuck is that on your lip? You look like a child molester. - You drag me out of bed to talk shit about my facial hair? - Take a seat, Ricky. - My back is killing me. Dead lifts. So, what's up, man, why am I here? - I see you, Ricky. You've got the fancy clothes. You're sleek and sexy, cold and calculating. - Thanks. - You're like a vampire. All you do is suck. You bleed everyone else around you dry. You're soulless. Vampires, they're soulless. - What are you talking about, vampire? I got a sick tan. - Werewolves. They've got soul, man. They're the working man's monster and they have to fend off the vampires. Me? I'm like a werewolf. Gnarly in every way. And when I turn... Time to pay what you owe. - Hasn't been close to a week yet. - The schedule's changed. - Where am I gonna come up with that kinda scratch right now? - I front you product, you sell it, and then you pay me back. That's how this works. Give me your wallet. - Don't do this cowboy shit, bro. - How does a guido mamowed fuck who owes me so much paper afford a new whip? You using my money to work with my enemies? - What are you talking-- - Give me the fucking wallet! - [Ricky] Look, I don't know who you been talking to-- - 700. You are a goddamn lowlife. Where's my money, Ricky? - What the fuck, Jay? - Look, I can get my hands on a few more Gs, but I need time. Jay, this is insane. All right, all right, you're right, you're right. I got work with the Greek. You're squeezing me out with these prices. You're squeezing all of us out. - Call me if he remembers where my money is. - You don't think Papadakis-- (menacing music) - What are you gonna do with him? - Let Petey work up a sweat. Then strip him down and dump his ass in Queensbridge. - How much you got so far? - 10 from my safe. 48 from you and Mutz on the outstanding, the Dominicans came through with another 15. 400 from Mutz's register. 700 from this piece of shit. Minus 200 for juice. That's 73,900. - Shit. You got a hold of Alex yet? - When you dump him, leave him with his underwear and a phone. - Yeah. (foreboding music) - Listen, every time, you bitch about the price. - Weed is so expensive. - You like me? So, why you fucking me, huh? (speaking in foreign language) Whoa. Look what Long Island spit up. - Jason. - Yunus. How's business? - Could always be better, my man. It's like Judean desert out there. - I'll hit you up. - You need a trim? - I need to talk. - Hey. But I'm a very good barber. - The best. - Don't trust me, Jason, huh? That's not the way to treat friends. - No way to treat a friend, Jason. - We are friends, yes? Team, we are. - Sure, Vuk. - Pay the man. - Take it easy on me, Jason. (folk music) (mumbling softly) - Stabiro, I thought you got yourself clean. - Using is cheaper than the rehab. - I heard you train. Or do you just wear tepa shirt like every other dickhead? - Working with Black Kev. You know? Nothing serious. - You come down here, you drive all this way to Ridgewood, Chase, Jay, and I know it's not because you miss me. You got my money? - It's coming. I just need more time. (speaking in foreign language) I just put product out on the streets. (speaking in foreign language) - My friend likes your watch. - Thanks. I need more time, Vuk. - [Vuk] Let him try it on. (speaking in foreign language) - Yeah, quite nicely. (speaking in foreign language) - One week is all I'm asking. If you snuff me now, you get whatever's in my pockets, some lint and the watch. - That watch? (Vuk clicking tongue) That's Nikola's watch. I know everything you do. A week won't do you any good. Go back to Long Island, Jason. - I know I can get you the full nut. - What makes you think I need your money? (deep electronic music) - Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck! Fuck it. Fuck it. (indie rock music) - What are you doing here? Boys came through? - Not now, Vic. - What do you mean not now? I'm just trying to talk to you, Jay. - What do you wanna talk about? Life, kids, the PTA. - Yeah, that's it, Jay. I wanna talk about the kids we don't have 'cause their dad is dead, couldn't stay out of the hustle. - I need to talk to BK to make sure that doesn't happen. You look good, you know that? - Hey, what's the scatter? - BK, I need to talk. - Where you been? - I've been... you know. - Been around. - Here? There? - Everywhere, right, BK, I need to grab your ear. - [BK] Not now, man, why don't you have you some fun? - Sweetheart, I need to talk to him for a minute. - We're having a nice chat. - I know, I know, now your son can't get that operation for his cleft asshole. Beat it. - You better have you a wet snatch because I'm about to face-fuck you. - I need an advance. - Advance? - Loan, whatever you wanna call it. - You can in come here and ask me for Tren, EQ, Winny, Primo, some Test, maybe the American kids, but don't come in here asking me for straight cash, dude, 'cause I ain't got that capital you need. You know the song? * Like a rhinestone cowboy Hustle's the name of the game, baby. - [Jay] Alright, I know. - You want some company? You know, you should really let me help you for once. (sexy rock melody) * I know you gonna * Drink my heart * Take your time, sugar * We got all night * I'm a sinner * So take me down * Down, down, down, down, down, down, down * * Oh, no, no * Woman, she's a woman, Wonder Woman * * Woman, she's a woman, Wonder Woman * - [Petey] Jay. Jay. Jay. She scored a lick of K. We can hit after hours, Pacha. - Ricky cave? - No. Paper's probably all on the street. - That piece of shit is juggling all my money. Let me get the jar. (sniffing) - Yo, dropping him in Queensbridge is some cold-blooded shit. Now, if he really is working with Papadakis, he will come at us. - I'll go to war with that Greek motherfucker. Fuck Ricky. Fucking rat. - What about Alex? - I'll squash that cockroach. - You guys are looking for Alex? He's been seeing my girl Robin. You probably know her, works down at Long Island Tan. - He might be there. - Thanks. You know where she lives? - I might. - Put the address in. - So, what do you wanna do about this Queens thing? - What do I wanna do? You tell me. What the fuck should I do? - The boy with the moon rocks is just a phone call away. Just sayin'. (ominous music) (gun clicks) - Oh my God, what the fuck? - Dude, what the fuck are you doing here? - Oh my God, what the-- - Shut up! Shut the fuck up. If you do not shut your mouth, I will smash your ugly whore face in. Do you have any Ambien? Go get me some. - Jay, Jay, I-- - [Jay] Get up. - I'm sorry, I swear I was gonna call you, man. Listen to me. I can fix this, okay? The Greek's last shipment, it got busted, and he is desperate for molly, all right, he is flush with cash. All right, put the gun down. - Get on your knees. - Don't, please. Listen to me, listen to me, listen to me. With Petey's connect and the money that you collected, we can fix this, okay? Please, no. Listen to me, please don't do this. Listen to me. I've been looking out for you since fucking kindergarten, man. Please don't fucking do this, we can fix this, I swear. I swear to God, we can fix this. - You swear? - Yeah, I swear.

Vic's a tough chick. She'll be okay. - Yeah. She's my rock. But this ain't easy. If I get through this, shit'll be different. - It always is. - Listen, Charlie. We do solid business, you and me. I know the juice is running, but I bring you a lot of paper, that's gone with the price on my head. - Things are good right now. Top of the food chain isn't gonna back you and pick a fight with these Serbians. - Then front me what I need. - Things ain't that good, kid. You got family, a rich uncle you could roll? - Nah. They don't have a pot to piss in. It's just me and Vic. - You'll figure it out. Rob, cheat, steal, or kill. There's always a way. (dark mysterious music) - Are you fucking serious? Hey! Jay, what the fuck? - Holy shit. - You have a death wish? - Come on, Vic. Whatever those scabs down at the club are saying, it's bullshit. Those ratchets are just jealous of what we've got. - We got three days to come up with more money than in your entire wheel and you're fucking sleeping, why do I even bother? - Victoria, really with this? - Yeah, really with this. I'm up all night working double shifts, ready to give you my savings. Look, I just hope you have a plan, that's all. - Once this is over, we'll go to Vegas. Just me and you and I don't know, maybe we'll see a show, you know, like do shit that normal people do there. - I made a G last night, that's eight. What good is normal if you're dead? - What you get me? It smells good. You're a godsend, but this nickel and dime shit ain't gonna make us whole. - We gotta rob someone. - We gotta rob someone. The Greeks got the paper and I heard he's desperate for product. - So, what's the fucking problem? - After the Ricky thing, he'll be ready. - I've been asking around at the club. There's a guy upstate, a cripple, who's mostly pills, oxy, roxy, Vicodins, but sometimes he has a bunch of grass that he has a hard time getting rid of, it's not really his thing. - He's a cripple? - War veteran or some shit, loves calling out for the primo pussy. You know, Ivy, she's been up there a couple of times. I guess the guy just got out of rehab, but still deals drugs. - I don't feel so bad robbing him if he can crush ass. - I don't know how much he's holding, should be an easy score, though. - Okay. Make the call, set it up. We'll take him for whatever he's got. - You need Petey? - Not on this one, it's just us. * Take me to the place where I believed in * * Take me to the place where we call home * * I wanna see the eyes we used to see in * * Stare into the windows up above * * There's no one, oh * Sunlight shining from above * Every night I wish that you were here* * There's no one * No one waiting for you, dear * Sunlight shining from you * Every night I wish that you were here * * There's no one - This is my boyfriend, Jay, Jay, this is-- - How you doing? This is good-- (banging) Can we cut the shit now? You party? - It depends on who's invited. - Her name is Roxana. - Sure thing, she's a friend of mine. Only thing better than pussy. You like to slam it? - Nah, man. I'm straight. - I like to do my drugs, the way I fuck. When I'm pounding the pussy, I like to hurt it. You like to hurt the pussy when you're fucking it? - Why the fuck not? It ain't mine. - I gotta use the little girl's room. - That is some fresh trim, boy. I'm into pussy. I like every shape, color, flavor. - Not that one, not tonight. That's mine. - Well, you know what they say, the meek shall inherit the earth. - Nah, man. The shit going on out there, all these school shootings, mall shootings, bombings, this thing we do for a living, there are predators coming at you from every angle, you need to be able to defend yourself, you need to be the big bad wolf. Are you the wolf? - [Crippled Man] What happened to the music? (chuckling) - Jay, you ready? I gotta go to work. - Now, now wait a minute, honey, I ordered some pizza. - I don't think we should hang around too long, clearly you couldn't get away fast enough the first time. - Did you forget something, darling? - Whoa. - You gonna come in here, make a deal, and leave without paying, that's just downright rude. - That's not what's going on. - Then how come I didn't hear a flush? Put your hands in your pocket, get your keys, put 'em on the table, slow. - [Victoria] Jay! (man grunting) - [Crippled Man] What the fuck, man? - I thought you were paralyzed. - I have MS, asshole. - Jay, let's get the fuck outta here. - I'm the wolf. - Holy shit. That is awful. - I told you, it's fucking mold. - 30 grand worth? That crippled piece of shit was gonna fuck us. - 12,500. - 93,600. - And the weed, we can't even smoke it. - The Jew. - Yeah, that cripple is a stingy bastard. - No. I can unload the skunked weed to Yunus and his brother, two Hasidics in Queens. They're so cheap, they'll actually take the time to grind it up and sell it off. - How much you think? - 10 pounds. Probably a few grand. - I need a bump. - Wait here. - No fucking shot. - Stay in the car, Victoria. (doorbell ringing) (door buzzing) - [Man] We talked all day every day for like two months now. - [Man] She have real job, yes? - [Man] Something's up, I know it. - [Jay] Mutz, Yunus. - Jason, come, sit. - My girl's in the car. - She's a woman, she will wait. - Oh, fuck, what's that smell? - The weed we talked about. - Jason, listen. I got a crisis on my hands. My girl, she hasn't called me back going on two days now and I have no idea why. - I tell him it could be she's crazy busy at work or maybe she think, "Holy shit, we talk all the time, "we need take break." - I'm telling you, something is up, I know it. - [Yunus] Yeah? - I only date strippers. - Oh, well, onto the next. - Don't be so cool, tonight, you text her, after she responds, you call her back tomorrow, tell him, but do not respond to text. - [Mutz] Hey, I mean, I sent her a text last night, asking if she was okay. (muffled speech) - Calm down. (Mutz speaks in foreign language) You don't have to do this, brother. - Save it. I need that money. Open it up. - We go way back, we do business together. (safe beeping) We're friends, yes? - Any other day, maybe a different story. How much is in there? - About 75 grand. - Fill a bag with 60,000... and I'm gonna take a ring from the shop, too. - Vuk? He's going to kill you. - Not anymore. (Yunus laughing) - You don't know Vuk. (thud) You, not know anything. - Throw it over here. The weed is yours. (tense music) Once I pay off this debt, my wheel is at zero and I've got no credit left with the Canadians. - Don't you guys still have product out on the street? They still owe you. Hey, I can carry us for a while at least until you get back to where you were. - I've been thinking. I want you to stop dancing. - So? What are you saying? - To trust me. I'll take care of you. Take this home, I'll get a ride. I need to talk to Petey about something. Vic? (car starts) I love you. (phone ringing) (phone ringing) I've got your cash. - [Vuk] Then bring it over. We'll have a party just for you. - I've still got two days. - [Vuk] You're a real cowboy, my friend. - When you get it, you start buying direct from me. Why go through some punk when you can go straight to the source? - [Vuk] When I get it, you have a deal. (dark ambient music) - Alex is in the ER: Few broken ribs, broken orbital. - What's he saying? - There's some static. Word on the wire is homeboy got hit by a car crossin' the street. - Good. - This Queens thing? - Squared away. Gonna be working with them moving forward. - Don't ask, don't tell. - I need you to make that call. I want 150 worth of moon rock yesterday. - You sure? - Money may not buy happiness, but I'll take my fucking chances. - My man.
