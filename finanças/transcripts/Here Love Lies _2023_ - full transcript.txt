Okay Amanda, I'll give you a clue. It has something to do with what I wanted us to talk about. Oh… The thing that you couldn't discuss on the phone. Mmm-hmm. The thing is we have been going out for about six months now. Right? And so I wanted us to you know take this thing... Um… Can you give me a few minutes? I need to get to the ladies… like I'll be right back. Is everything okay? Of course. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Huh. Hello babes, what's up? What happened? Babe, there's a big problem. Please don't tell me he forgot his wallet at home please. I think he's about to propose. Yes, he's about to propose Oh my God… yay Oh my God, are you serious? You should be grateful he's not one of those nonsense guys. That will be acting as your boyfriend for months, no proposal, nothing At least he's about to propose… So how is that an issue? Nora. - Wait, you haven't told him about Nora? - No. Babes it's Jide, the guy loves you. That's the same we thought about George and Okopi and Rogers. Please! Please!! Please!!! We're talking about someone that is quite sensible here. Not all those idiots that heard you have a child and then decided to disappear because of the fear of paying school fees. Uh-uh, no. Amanda, level with me. Are you not feeling the guy? You know that I am. It's the only reason why I'm not letting him get… intimate with me. Are you joking? Six months babes. Ah-ah, what? You know you could possibly have cobwebs down there right now. Just thank God that I'm not that guy Or else I would have absconded by now. You should just donate your thing to a convent. Well, am I thankful you're not him. On a serious not I think you should just go out there and tell him about Nora. It's Jide, it's Jide he loves you. He's not going to do anything about it, the guy loves you. Are you sure? Yes, I'm very sure. And when you get back there just act surprised. Don't do all these… Okay? I'll put wine inside the fridge, we're going to celebrate tonight. And when you get back we're going to talking about Aso-ebi stuff. - Colors, yellow, purple… - Stop it. Let the proposal happen first before you start planning my wedding. My baby is about to get taken! Whoop! Whoop! Whop! whop! I guess you should get going. Alright, bye. Love you. Love you too, bye. Don't do it. Look, I didn't mean that. Sorry I listened to your phone conversation. Don't tell him about your daughter. It never ends well. Same thing happened to me years ago. No one wanted to marry me because of my daughter. Past forty today, I'm here… Celebrating my fourth year wedding anniversary. And till today… My husband thinks my daughter is my niece. I'm sure you're wondering how I'm pulling it off. Well, the thing is we were married… I convinced him to send her to school abroad. Well… Congrats on your soon to be engagement. Hmm… Hey. You're back. Yeah I um… I… You look like you have something on your mind. Actually, yes. You do. Okay, let it out. So while I was back there in the rest room… I was trying to figure out a way to… get you to tell me what's in the box. Because I hate surprises so… Aha… Okay, I'll tell you. So the thing is… I have… I… Go on. Look, even if you've killed someone. Okay, did you kill anyone? Because even if you did, look… I'll help you hide the body. Okay, so out with it. I… have a medical condition. Oh wow. - Yeah. - You do? Oh dear, I'm so sorry. How long have you been dealing with this? Bastard! You lying bastard. You're a stupid man. So this is the fellowship you were going for? - Mabel just jus... - Oh please keep quiet. I knew it. My instincts told me that you had started again. But I said "Mabel, come on, stay positive." "Your darling husband has learnt his lesson." "He has changed." But then, I opened up your gift. And guess what I found. This… Does this look like your wife's size? Does it? It's obviously not my s... Hey, aunty. Where do you think you're going? Take a seat. Don't make me descend on you. Hmm… Does this tiny thing… Does it look like what your wife wears? Is this my size? I said you should not… It is you. It's obviously yours. Husband snatcher. Husband snatcher. Cheap prostitute. Woo! Let me see what he got for you. Shameless thing, you want to snatch my husband right? Hmm… I said it. You see… God's gift. Purely natural, not surgery, not Lekki. Did you think this would be her size? You thought this would be her size right? - Take a look at your tomato breasts. - Okay... - Does this look like your size? - Okay Mabel… You're embarrassing us. Will you shut up there? Embarrassing what? Look, the world must hear. You took a part of my soul But I'd still give you more babe All men are scum. All of them. I tried… I really tried. I checked his online profile. There was no clue that he was married. Like, I'm done. I'm done with all of them. I'm done with all men. Is that him? Give me the phone. Let me curse his life and his generation. Give me the phone. - It's not him. - Amanda. Amanda. Seriously it's some… Some guy who is obsessed with my blog and he keeps blowing up the comment section... Give me the phone. I know you're very cool. But I'll make sure to deal with him. I'm going to help you find this closure, by the time I insult his generation… I insult everyone in his life… Michael007. What's up?

Really, I want to stay with you. But you know, I've just been postponing this date for about a month now. - And it's not just... - I'll be okay, really. Are you sure? So what are you going to do when I'm gone? Yes, that's what's up! Bad bitch!

But Mr. Mike, my counselor in school... I don't care what Mr. Mike says Nora. I'm your parent. You're going to boarding school and that's it. Now go and wait for aunty Kemi in her car. What? I'm done. I'm just done! Can you imagine he's not been replying my text messages just because I said "Oh I'm not going to spend the night at your place" He's just so selfish. And the last time I spent the night at his place… He didn't let me sleep. He was just tossing me all over the place. The kind of waist pain I experienced for a week I couldn't feel my legs... You're laughing. No, no, no, not at you. Somebody sent something to my phone and just... Amanda I left my department just to come and pour out my heart to you - and then you're laughing at me. - Please I'm sorry. You can't even keep your eyes of Michael's text. Who said it was Michael? - Really it's not... - Yes, it is not... Give me the phone, give me the phone. Sorry. Give me my phone please. Idiot. Keep deceiving yourself, like you and I don't know you've fallen in love with the guy. - Fallen in love? - Oh yes. A fat chance. Babe, my heart is locked away in a safe - and I've thrown away the keys. - Oh really? This that I'm doing right here is called "catching cruise". - Hmm… - Yes. Nonsense, nonsense. Who is there? - Come in! - Are you expecting someone? Hey, um…this came in for you. Oh. Okay, thank you. Your favorite food. Wait, from who? Aww… - Our new boyfriend. - He's not my boyfriend. Eh… he knows your favorite food. He knows your favorite restaurant and he's not your boyfriend. Yeah right. Please say something else. But wait a minute. I thought white guys liked to send flowers and stuff. Is that him? - Kemi... - Wait, wait, wait… Kemi why are you like this? Please give me my phone. Hi Michael. This is Kemi. Amanda's best friend, - so we got the food you sent. - Kemi stop it, Kemi stop. And Amanda absolutely loves it, thank you so much. By the way Michael I thought white guys - like to send flowers and all that stuff. - Kemi, give me my phone. - What gives? - Don't send it, don't! Why are you like this? I'm sorry, too late. Hold on, why are you upset? I thought it was all fun and games. So? Is that why you have to send him stuff? Okay, he just replied. How come he's awake by this time, wait… Hello Kemi, hi Amanda Very funny Kemi Why would I send flowers? Is that what she'll eat? Wait, he sent another one. How's my pidgin? I've been watching Nigerian movies like you suggested and in one of them, I learned that sending flowers is a no, no. I swear this guy is smart. He has done his thorough research. Okay, now that lunch is here… - Mummy - Yes. You said you're traveling again. Yeah, uh… it's a work trip but don't worry I won't be gone for long. And aunty Kemi is going to be here with you. And both of you can get up to all the mischief you get up to when mummy is not around. But why can't your office people send someone else? Does it always have to be you? Okay… Your phone… when did I get it? The last time you travelled. So let's just assume that they send someone else for this trip, where would I get the travel bonus that I use to buy your phone… and all the nice things I buy for you. And even pay your school fees? Good. I think… we're all done. Look at it. Do you like it? - Mummy. - Yes. Who is Michael? What? What Michael? Aunty Kemi always talks to me about a Michael that is your friend. Oh, that Michael My colleague, our colleague… at work… colleague. What? Can't I cough again? You know… my counselor in school his name is Michael. Mr. Mike. - He's really... - Okay. Hold it. If this about talking to Mr. Mike about going to boarding school, it's not going to happen. So drop it. Baby. I know that you're not crazy about going to boarding school. But you have to trust… that I'm making the best decision for you. For us. Are you ashamed of me? Chimnoram. Why would you think that? How could I ever be ashamed of you baby? Please don't send me away. I promise to be good. Baby, I'm not… Amanda. What? Um… baby let's talk about this later okay. Alright. How did you find my place? Sorry I showed up like this. You weren't responding to my messages. - I've been trying to reach... - Muna, what do you want? I just wanted to see you and… check on you and see how things are. And now that you've done that… Goodbye. Amanda please. Please wait. Please. I get that you don't want to see us, or hear from any of us. But Amanda please. We are trying. Please… I'm sorry for the part I played. I was young and stupid. But really I reacted how any other teenage girl will act when her sister gets pregnant for her boyfriend. You can't blame me Amanda. You guys disowned me. Kicked me out onto the streets. But you know what? It's fine. Because I'm over it. Please tell me what we can do to make things right. Make things right. You know what? You, tell me… what grand plans you guys have to somehow erase the pain. Father please, please… The horror. The torture. No, no… That I went through, homeless on the streets, with a baby to fend for. Amanda, I can't imagine... No you can't! Because if you could, you would not be here asking me. How to make things right. Muna. Stay away from me. Stay away from me. Just… Give me time. Okay, fine. Fine. How much time? My life time. I know I shouldn't have done that. I just thought it was high time you forgave them. - That was not your place. - I know. I told you everything I went through with them. And you can't continue to live your life like this. At some point bitterness will kill you. It doesn't make sense. This is why she came. This is what she came to show me, to rub in my face that she's getting married! You tell me that you're sorry Will make up tomorrow Tell me everything You know I wanna hear I'm trying to be open… Nora. Nora. Nora. I know you're not sleeping. I'm leaving for the airport now.

So my organization believes strongly that we can do business that's mutually beneficial to us both. We saw the proposal you sent in and responded. We're in. We sent the mail to your office this morning. You must have been on the flight. Yes I was. Wow, that's great. Please don't tell me that's why you came over to the states. Securing this deal is very important to us but also attending the convention is a very important annual commitment for us. Awesome, I feel better. So if you'll excuse me I must get to the convention now. Absolutely. Um… thank you so much for meeting me on short notice. - The pleasure is all mine. - Thank you. May I give you a ride to the venue? - Oh yeah. - I assume you're not driving. Thank you, that's so kind of you. Absolutely. Thank you. Yeah, I'll keep that.

How's our lover boy, have you guys met? Not yet. But I'm right now on my way to surprise him. Hey, Amanda, Amanda… You're still insistent on this surprise visit thing. And you're so vehemently against it because? Okay, so listen to me. I don't have a problem with it, but imagine if out of the blues this guy just shows up at our doorstep. And at that particular point in time you don't have make up on. Don't get me wrong it's not like there'll be a disaster or anything. But then you'd love to be at your best when you're meeting him for the first time so… Look, I just want to meet the real him. Right? Without any pretenses. Okay. Well, I've said my piece. This one that you're so serious about meeting... Like… I don't get it. Anyway… I honestly hope this guy is as he looks on social media. I hope he doesn't turn out to be an eighty plus year old man. I've had so many video calls with him Kemi and you know this. Where is all this coming from? I don't know I'm just anxious for you. I don't know… Amanda honestly I really want this to work. Alright.

And around here we should be able to see Time Square… and Rock-a-Fella center. Uh-mm… They are kind of in the same area. The Brooklyn bridge. It took two generations of a family to build. The contractors started the project in 1869… - and they finished it… - Oh, fourteen years later. That's right. Fun fact, around 20 to 30 people died under this original construction. Including the original designer of the bridge. What was his name again? - John A. Roebling. - Yes, right…right. He actually got his leg crushed by some boat. And they later amputated his toes. But he later died of tetanus and his son took over the project. Is it eerie? Yeah. And here we are at time square. Guys, this is where the ball drops every year for new year's eve.

Did you know that the highline was actually saved from demolition by neighborhood residence in the city of New York. It actually opened in 2009 as a public space where visitors could experience nature like if you're into art and design… and other really cool stuff like the buildings.

Uh-mm… Do you see her over there? Young lady. Young lady, that lady is thirsty for your man. You need to mark your territory and put her in her place. Honey. Wait, I'm just telling the truth. I remember when Becky tried that nonsense back in the seventies. I pulled out her hair and I knocked out her front teeth Till this day she still has bald spots and wears veneers, and I still have my Larry I'm so sorry. It's okay sir. Uhm… do you know where the restroom is? Yeah. - Thank you, excuse me. - Okay. Thank you. Why are you trying to call me out like that? - I'm trying to help this child out. - You're telling this… - thirty years old story - And you just threw me under the bus. Every time you tell this story. Okay, last one here… Okay, wow. This is so good. Hey, we should do this again sometime you know, just the two of us. My friend Amanda… is special. I'm trying to have a nice time with her and you're getting in the way. Stay away. Hey, so I saw Michael on a tour with an African lady. Wonder what he's up to. Dude, should I be surprised? I mean the guy owns the freaking touring outfit, I don't understand why he's just trying to pass off as a regular customer. Two words for you bro… Nigerian. Scam. 419. - Those are five words. - You get my point. Dude, when you're super rich like that, you can't be concerned with all these Nigerian guys come on. That is some bad shit ignorance you just spewed out of your mouth. Look… I just call it like I see it. Just saying. Come on. Hey, where have you been? I've been looking all over for you. What's wrong? Why didn't you tell me that you own the tourism outfit that has been taking us around. I uh… - I didn't think it was... - Don't worry. You won't have to deal with being scammed by yet another Nigerian. Goodbye Michael. Amanda please wait. Leave me alone or else I'll go crazy on you right here! Are you crazy? I know I can be unkind But you're not always understanding I like to take my time But time is what you're always chasing I know I like to hide Hello, are you there? I'm here. Okay, so after you heard what did you do? I just told him off and left. Hello? Okay, he's rich. How rich are we talking about here? Seriously Kemi. I just bared my soul out to you and all you can think about is rich. Okay. Have you told him about Nora? Now, look at this… Imagine if he heard you have a daughter before you had the opportunity of telling him, and he reacts this exact way you're reacting. How would it make you feel? You know you're not being fair right now. No, life is not fair Amanda. And I'm your ride or die, I should be able to tell you the truth when you're messing up. Like you're messing up right now babe. Look… All I'm just trying to say is… sleep on it. If you wake up tomorrow and you feel the same way, that's fine. Alright, no problem. - I have to go, bye. - Amanda I... Woke up this morning Come on, answer your phone. Hi, good morning. I need to speak with one of your guests. Yeah… No, I don't know. Her name is Amanda. Chimamanda Abraham. What? Amanda! Amanda! Amanda, please… Please we have to talk. Please… Come on. Alright. I'll get this. Come on. Look… I've been hurt so many times. People always trying to rip me off, even close friends. I get close to them and they disappear. How many times is someone supposed to deal with that before they protect themselves. But I… I messed up. And I'm truly sorry. What can I do to make this right? I'm not going to let you go. So um… when you got here if … you had found out that I've gone to the airport, were you going to do the whole romcom cliché thing of chasing me down, and delivering a heart felt romantic speech? That was the plan. Look… I would have surprised you. Do you think this is a movie? There's no harm in trying. So… I take it my pidgin is getting better? Like absolutely excellent. Oh my goodness. Wow… Thank you. Let's get this stuff, take it back upstairs. Hmm? So, how… how do I know about… Hmm mm… The guy who's all in the travel and tourism Come on. Oh, excuse me. All right - I need to take this. - All right, it's fine. This is Michael, yeah talk to me. Careful. There you go. Ugh… Damn looking forward to this Whoa, whoa… You got it backwards. This is mine. That's hers. Why would you assume how I want the jollof rice? I see it's spicy That's what I care for man. - Huh - Enjoy Okay. Let's get going. Um, do you want to take just a little bit first? I'll be all right. It's kind of… Heaven. It's not… too spicy? It's okay. Can I take a piece? Have at it. You see. Are you serious? What? Are you serious right now? Really? Oh my God. So, I've been coming here since my college days, Some of my Nigerian buddies showed it to me. I love this place Oh my goodness, look at you. Oh my goodness… What is happening? Learner, come on. Oh, that's so tall. They don't have buildings like that? Excuse me, we do have buildings - like that in Nigeria. - Okay. - Then why are you so impressed? - I'm just saying that… this particular one is really tall. - Oh okay - Yeah It all right, they're taller. What? I know it's a shot in the dark. But… I'm going to put it out there I think you should stay a few more days. - What? - Michael come on. We just started warming up to each other. I feel like… We just started being honest, I want you to know the real me better. - I'm thinking… - Come on. - Come on. - Thinking… Just saying. - It's insanity, that's what that is - I know right. Whatever. And so, now that you have finally emotionally blackmailed me into staying a few more days, what's the plan? Well… I'd like to take you to a place where I only take the closest people. Hmm… You'd love it. But, you'd find it hard to leave. Okay, okay. So, where is this magical place? My home. Uh-mm, Okay. I'm…. I'm going to have to tell you something. Okay. At least, you can tell me anything. I… Amanda, you can trust me. You can feel safe. I mean… Unless… Please don't tell me you're a vegetarian I can't deal. Stop making me laugh. Um… So the thing is… I have a daughter. Alright. And? That's it. I have a daughter. I... I… I I don't understand, what… What are you expecting? That's meant to be a deal breaker for guys right? What guys have you been hanging out with? Are you serious? Is this a Nigerian thing? Do guys over there they just…come on. They just run away? You're not joking with me right now? No I'm not, like are you for real? You're making me worried about who you've been spending your time with, because this doesn't make sense to me. It's like… my opinion of… kind of questioning. I'd love to meet your daughter. What's her name? Chimnoram. Chim… Can I just say "Nora"? Yeah I was just messing with you, that's what everybody calls her. - I guess. - So Chimnoram means… "As long as God is in control, everything will be okay". It's deep. Wish I had a Nigerian name, could be Nigerian… - I guess I'd have to be black first right? - Yes, that. There is that… Nora. I guess she's a lovely girl. Just like her mum. What? You had me thinking we were going to be out, burying a body together or something. And then I find out you have a daughter. You're weird. No, come here, come here. I want to be… A part of, each and every part of your life. In totality. Come here. You're going to make me cry. Let's go. Fine day isn't it? Yeah. It's beautiful. Right? - This is us, my old and faithful. - Oh Texas? Long story. Let's go get your bag. Okay. Alright. - So gentlemanly… - There you go, I do what I can. Thank you. Let's just take a ride along the bay We don't need to work We can sit around and play After waiting for so long to get away Baby don't hold back, All you gotta do is say What would you like To be satisfied with me I've been counting moments of love I've been catching signs from above All I wanna do is satisfy you Baby all you want is To be satisfied with me Um, how much further are we going? Oh, we'll be there soon. My little slice of heaven, you're gonna love it. Why do you think so? So, you remember that blog entry you wrote about your bucket list? And on it, there was cabin in the woods. Have you really read all my blog posts? Of course. Look, I think you're a great writer. To be honest, I'm kind of hoping you might write an article while we're here. Witness greatness at work. Be careful what you wish for Yeah… Alright. That's what I'm talking about. Finger crossed, no promises. Okay. You get me all excited now. We've been drinking Champagne on the beach of Malibu Cruising down the boulevard Kissing in the back seat of the car Making love under the stars How would you like To be satisfied with me I've been counting moments of love I've been catching signs from above All I wanna do is satisfy you Baby all you want is To be satisfied with me It's like the middle of nowhere. Don't like the mountains? - It's beautiful right? - New experience. Alright. All I wanna do is satisfy you Baby all you want is To be satisfied with me After you. Whoa. This is another romcom cliché but… Welcome to my humble abode. So… Nice. Whoa… Wow… That's a lot of dead animals. Well, I can't take credit for all of them. But it's home. No, no, no… It's okay, it's okay. It's just Edna. She… She takes care of the house for me. Oh… She's known me since I was an errant teen. Edna, you can not be sneaking up on us like that. No, it's okay. It's okay… she… It's fine, no problem. So you're taking her side now? Edna? This is Amanda, she's our guest. Nice to meet you ma. Um… Edna. She not the most talkative. I really should let her go but, I keep her around because she doesn't have anyone. She's like me. Aww… But, let's get you moved in. For all the pain that you have caused me. That child you're carrying will cause you so much pain. So much more. So much more pain. More. No, no, no… More… What happened? I had a nightmare. Come here. Do you want to talk about it? So what your father said…. The curse. It sounds like it did some serious emotional damage. Sometimes I… My daughter Nora… I feel like maybe my dad's curse is in effect, you know? She's always so moody and so defiant, like I… I think she hates me. That's just a teenager, it's normal. They're always abnormal. What your dad said, that's… That's just the pained words of a control freak parent. What you want to do, what you want to believe, that's all that matters. Thank you. Doctor Phil. You're welcome ma'am. - I think I'm more a Tony Robbins guy. - Um-hmm… - I hear you. - Yeah. It has been, so long… since I've been this happy. I finally feel at peace. With everything that happened to you in Nigeria, I just want you to stay, I can take care of you. You complete me. I'm never letting you go. Never. My stomach just growled. I need food. I'll go serve dinner, okay? Aww… so romantic. You just relax here. - Go… - Jesus! Good evening Edna. Go… Ah… I hope you enjoyed dinner? I did. Thank you. Yeah. So when are we leaving for the airport tomorrow morning? It's a long way out here. I don't want to be late for my flight. Well… I was hoping you'd stay a little longer. Seriously. Whatever the charge is to change it, I'll take care of it. Actually, I originally booked two weeks for this trip. - But… - No buts. My travel agent will handle it. But Nora. I need to get back to my daughter. She's not talking to me right now. Pulling a Nora card that's pretty low. No… - Alright - Come on. Alright. We'll leave first thing in the morning. There you go. Somebody is missing me already. Yes. Alright, I'll take this. Leave it, I'll get it. Why not, I'm not doing anything right now, and you made dinner so… Go freshen up. It's your last night after all - Okay. - Go on. Yeah. Are you okay? I'm fine. I just had a little bit too much. Amanda! Thank God, you're awake. Come here. Edna. You have to stop scaring my guest, please leave. I'm sorry about that. How are you feeling? My head hurts. What time is it? It's about 9am. - My flight - No, no… you can't… You can't go on a trip right now. I've called my doctor. He's on his way down to see you now. - Yes, but I... - I understand I understand, I do.

Now, go grab some sleep and stop worrying your pretty head. I love you. Hey… Amanda. Again? Babe, what's going on? What's up with this radio silence? I don't understand. Nora and I have been trying to reach you for like… …forever and nothing You didn't even think to send us a simple message on WhatsApp. It doesn't make sense. You can't just meet a man and forget about us. Is the "thing" really that good? Oh… Um… So, your mum came. And your sister. And they said something like… you blocked them. Babe, honestly I hope you're fine. Whatever it is, just buzz us when you can, okay? And greet hubby for us. I miss you, I miss you. Bye… Baby, you're looking so much better today. It's time for soup.

Just a little bit of soup. My phone… My phone. Edna? My phone. Please do you know where my phone is? Edna my phone. There you are. You had us worried, what happened? I saw her. I saw her. You saw who? Edna? Liz. I saw… I saw her. Liz? This is worse than I thought. You… you're hallucinating. No. Ask, Edna saw… Ask Edna. Edna… Was someone here? You saw her. You saw her. You saw her. We'll need to get you to a hospital. Please, my phone. Do you have it? Yes, it's with me. Okay. Please I need it. Okay. Give me a second. Michael. Michael, did… Did you lock the door? Back to bed dear. Michael. Please. Open the door. I can't. It's for your own safety, you're hallucinating now. Michael, you don't know that. You're not a doctor, I need a doctor please. I used to be a paramedic. I know a thing or two. Oh, let me out… Please, let me out. Please… Get some rest dear. Please… Please, let me out. Michael. Michael. Who's there? No time… Quick, come, come… Edna? Edna. Edna. Hey, please you need to be quiet. I'm trying to help you. Your life is in danger, we need to get out of here now. Several women, mostly Nigerian, arrive the states then disappear. Michael is our prime suspect. They can all be traced to him as the last contact before he went missing. He is sick. We need to get out of here now. Before... Don't move! What's going on. I'm detective Sanders and you're under arrest. Arrest? But what for? The kidnapping of Amanda Abraham. Don't be ridiculous. I will shoot you if you move any closer right now. Like Amanda, most of the women you bring here are never heard from again. - You killed them. - What! Get on your knees. Amanda. Are you okay? - Did she hurt you? - Get on your knees. Don't be afraid, it's all going to be fine. But don't listen to her. I had some of my guys look into her she's a nutcase. - Shut up. - She obsesses over men, She stalks them… - Shut up. - Some of them have been killed. That badge is fake. He's lying…I to... Stay down. No time. Quick. Sweetie… where are you going? Go. Edna. After all I've done for you. Keeping you on when no one else would. Go. No time, go! - I'm not going without you Edna. - You trust her? You trust her more than you trust me? She's been there for every one of the girls. She's my family. I'm the only family she has. Say what you want. You will not kill this girl too. You, you'll have to go through me. What will you do? Hmm? Amanda, go. Come back to me and we'll be normal again. I promise. Nothing is normal with us. You make me do evil. Because I have no choice. It stops now. Amanda! Amanda! Amanda! Amanda! There's no one else out here but us. You can go on for days and not get anywhere. Amanda! I don't want to shoot you Amanda. I just want to talk, I don't want to kill you. Amanda! I hoped, I really prayed. You said you would stay with me. I showed you nothing but love. And just like the others, you want to leave me. Why am I so hard to love? Why are you leaving after all we shared? Don't move. I love you. I swear it. Don't cry, no, no, no… Don't cry. I don't want to see you cry. You made me mad… because you made me kill Edna. She was all I had. And you made me kill her. But you know what? I'll forgive you. I'll forgive you. If you promise not to run away again. Okay, okay, I promise. I'll get rid of the gun. - You promise? - I promise. I promise. Can you see? I knew you'll come back. You forgot me. Don't worry, just let it happen. This time you won't wake up. He's been linked to the disappearance of over fifteen women. What? Most of them Nigerian. Most of them we will discover when forensics is done. They lye in those shallow graves that you noticed in the woods. So, did he get them all through his touring company? He never owned a touring company. We've arrested a couple of men who he paid to make women believe he's rich. He doesn't own anything. This cabin… belongs to the first victim he killed. Thanks to Liz's passion and doggedness this could have gone on for much longer. So is there anyone else that you've seen with him? Anyone at all that could be in on this. Apart from Edna, he did say he had no family. No, he never had family. He grew up in an orphanage that he fled from as a teenager to avoid therapy sessions and treatments for his mental disorder. Oh my goodness. Wait… There was a lady I met with him in New York. He said that she was he's cousin, Natasha. Not a blood relative. They grew up in the orphanage together. That's what they called each other at the orphanage "cousins" Yeah, we've spoken to her. She's given us the back story on his time there. She's terribly shocked by all this, and swears she thought he was in treatment this whole time. Wow. So… Why Nigerian women? Well, we're still gathering information but we've contacted the Nigerian Embassy. They are on standby to take care of whatever it is that you might need before you return home. Thank you so much. Thank you so, so much. Is there anything else I can do for you right now? I need to get this. Excuse me. Hello babe. Hello. Babe, what's going on? Why did you just abandon everybody? Was the "thing" really that good? Long story. Can I talk to Nora please? Wait… Babe are you okay? Look, I'll gist you later, can I just talk to my baby? Yeah, yeah… hold on. Mummy. Hello. Mummy are you okay? Mummy I'm so sorry, I've been worried about you. I love you so, so much. I'm sorry too, I miss you. I'm coming home. Ah-ah… - Look at this. Oh, that is lovely. - Oh my God. - You like? - This is beautiful. - Eh, I like it too. - Oh… But I like this one too. Yeah but this, this, this is like… like it suits my skin color. Yay, I'm getting married. Look at me. - But this is nice. - I am getting married. - Okay, this one is for you? - Your father and for the entire family. Okay. -Your father too. -Okay. - Your father, me, and you. - Okay… Mummy. Daddy. Nora. Chimnoram. Chimnoram. Chimnoram… Chimnoram. Chimnoram, come. Chimnoram. Oh. Chimnoram. Chimnoram. You know I missed you. It's fine. Chimnoram. Chimamanda… Chimamanda. Subtitle translation by Adefoluke Adebayo
