Where is Bobby? In the washroom. Is he not ready yet? I've been asking him to propose to Geetha for the last four years but he hasn't. Now within four more days, our project work will also come to an end. If he fails to propose now, he will never get another chance. I'm ready buddy. To where? To attend an interview? Bloody… Does anyone approach a girl in this attire? Even my mood has been ruined. Chill dude! I'll take care of it. -Shut up. Geetha is as colourful as a weekend and he is mundane like monday morning. Don't worry. I'll set it right. Come along. Okay. Now he is at least like a Friday night. - Come. - Let's go. Bobby, to propose to a girl is just like writing an M1 exam. There is no assurance of passing the exam but one should not be disheartened with the failure. What an analogy, dude! As soon as you express your love, they might get violent and scratch, scream, hit, pull, push, etc. Don't take it to heart or you'll be hurt. So, take it easy man. I hope she doesn't complain to her father. Bobby, she won't go that far. Take it easy. It feels like I'm going to war. This is the right decision, Bobby. You unnecessarily wasted last four years. Be confident. The more you are confident, the more are the chances of Geetha committing to a yes. That's it! But I feel a bit nervous. Propose to her like our hero Balayya! Why don't you ask him to thump his thighs as well? Get lost! Bobby, we'll be right here. We will whistle as soon as the figure arrives. She is our friend's lover. She is not some figure, call her sister. Got it? Hey! All the best. Go for it. Geetha? What happened Bobby? Siddhu has been in love with you since the last four years. Please accept him. I've been telling this to you since forever that you should leave their company. Geetha, he is not as bad as you imagine. He has cleared all his backlogs. He got selected in the campus interview and has earned a job as well. Don't try to convince me. I know him very well. You write his records, complete his projects and only with your help does he clear his exams. Also, you are responsible for his campus placement. He is good for nothing. I know it very well. Will she agree? What are they both talking about? Wait, I'll lip-read it. Don't do this, Bobby. Even I like Siddhu. Had my father not been the principal I would have already eloped with him. Are you sure? Trust me. Forget about him, tell me if you love me, I might consider your proposal. I don't mean that. I'm not interested in you. Geetha, take this flower. He'll feel good. Ask him to shove it in the right place. To hell with her, the only qualification she has is that she is the principal's daughter. Take it easy. Excuse me. Siddhu! You are way too off-limits. I'll see your end. What if she complains to her dad? -That shrimp? How dare you propose to my daughter? I will teach you a lesson. Susheela. -Sir? Type a letter saying that these idiots are suspended for one month. The whole college will be cheerful. Okay, sir. Sir, we have only four days left in this college. Why do you want a suspension letter? Do you think you are being over smart? Susheela… Sir? Get me a letter saying they have bad conduct. They'll be stripped of their job placements. Please, sir. Dad. -Siddhu, she is back again. I've put a full stop to their life, you carry on with your classes. Dad, listen to me. -Suresh and gang gave me a love letter. What happened to you? The love which loves love loves the love that loves for love. Susheela… -Sir? Get ready their conduct certificates also. Yes, sir! No, sir. Daddy. -Who did it now? Ramesh and co. , dad. Love is so melodious but the lover's father is obnoxious. Stop! Susheela… -sir. If we give a bad conduct certificate to one then it means he is useless. But if we give bad conduct certificates to everyone… I'm the useless one then! Yes, sir. Do one thing. Suspend my daughter. Daddy? That will be good riddance for us. Good idea, sir. Go. Go and watch 'Karthika Deepam' daily soap. Daddy. Siddhu! You can enjoy yourselves now. But don't forget that there is a project left that will show daylight stars to you. Don't take much stress, bro. Life is a big drama. Take a chill pill, bro. Let's change the year of life. If you didn't understand the alpha, beta, gamma… Let's throw away the books and celebrate life. No matter if you have failed the exams or fell flat in your VIVA or had a major love failure… With your friend on your side, every day of your life is a celebration. With the support of your friend, you can live life carefreely. With your friend on your side, every day of your life is a celebration. With the support of your friend, you can live life carefreely. If you bunk the class, he will fill in your proxy attendance. He will even write our assignments on our behalf. He will be your backbone through all your backlogs. He will join you for your night outs as well as your hangouts. Let it be the mess bill or room rent or empty petrol tank, even if you are penny-less, by stealing away your shirt, or any bullshit. No matter what the problem is… With your friend on your side, every day of your life is a celebration. With the support of your friend, you can live life carefreely. Don't take much stress, bro. Life is a big drama. Take a chill pill, bro. Let's change the year of life. Like you save all your income in your bank account. Similarly, you safely lock away all your feelings in your friend's heart-locker. No need to be formal with him, informality is the expression of love. You share a cup of tea with him at the tea stall on the street corner. Be it hot or cold, be it Everest or hell, no matter how bad your situation is, any shit you are facing, be it a small altercation or a huge rumpus, or let the tsunami swallow you away… With your friend on your side, every day of your life is a celebration. With the support of your friend, you can live life carefreely. With your friend on your side, every day of your life is a celebration. With the support of your friend, you can live life carefreely. Give me the yellow one, please. Give me the yellow one. Are you blind? Compared to our college, the JNTU girls are just Mad Max! True. They are just awesome. Yeah, that's true. -Shut up. The grass is always greener on the other side. Where are you going? It's somebody's exam hall ticket and the exam is at 10:30. If she doesn't get this, she'll miss her exam. Bobby, it is none of our concern. The exam is in another half an hour. I'll be back soon. Just a minute. Let's get something to eat by the time he comes back. Sir. Please, sir. Don't waste my time, dear. I can't allow you to enter without the hall ticket. Sir, this is about my life. Please concede for just this once. -How many times do I have to repeat myself? You can't enter the exam hall without the hall ticket. That's final. Hello, What an irritating girl! Hello, tell me. -Where are you? I'm at the temple. Why are you at the temple? I had a solemn vow. Okay. You seem to be busy worshipping. I'll call you back later. Thank you so much. You owe me another thanks. Why? Your hall ticket. Oh my God. You have done a big favour to me. Thank you so much. Siddha. We had so many girls in our college. Why did you have to irk the Principal's daughter? What if he fails us in the project work? We will lose our jobs. Girls are sexier when they are almost in their adulthood. You fool, I have my balls on fire and you are concerned about girls and aunties! You don't deserve to be a fan of Balayya! Anyway, Bobby will manage our project work. You call out Balayya's name and calm yourself. Jai Balayya! Refrain yourself from consuming alcohol or smoking cigarettes until the project work is completed. Focus on the project. Take this. Complete this by morning. Please, dude. Okay? - Cheers. - Its okay dude. Mom, tell me. -What are you doing, dear? I was evaluating the question paper that I had written in the morning. Careful. If your husband finds out that you are studying then he will make all our lives hell. Did you go to the hospital? I did, mom. It was just a minor psychiatric problem. They guess it was due to heavy tension. They have prescribed medicines. It is because of us. We made your life hell by getting you married to him. Please forgive dear. Mom. I'm doing well. You don't have to worry about me. I don't know how you are coping. Does he at least know that you have been talking to us? No, mom. Mom, he is here. I'll call you back later. -Take care, dear. I'm coming. Why did it take so long to open the door? I had milk boiling on the stove. Is it? Shall I serve dinner? No need. Are you there? -Coming. What is that? -Milk. Have it. Cheers. Lay down. Lay down. Dear? Dear? We can talk tomorrow. Go to sleep. Are you not satisfied with your partner? Is your sex life not pleasurable? Then there is no point in struggling mentally. You must talk to your partner. Talks lead to solutions in most cases. It is easier said than done. Be in my shoes, you will understand my plight. Talk leads to solutions! Go… Go… talk to him. Hi. This is Bobby. I gave you your hall ticket. Hi. Thanks. You helped me a lot. I was expecting a coffee but you are asking me to settle with just thanks? I looked for you after the exam but I didn't find you. How about tomorrow? I can't. My exams have finished. I won't return to Kakinada anymore. Why are you dull? Because I missed the chance to have a coffee with a beautiful lady. You are married, right? Are you not asleep yet? How are marriage and sleep both related to each other? I mean, are you feeling lonely? Why isn't she replying? Hello. Are you there? My husband is at work. He is yet to come back. He doesn't know about your exams, right? How do you know? I rang the bell. Remember? By the way, where are you from? And your age? Wrong question. And? Your phone number? He is being too fast. Good morning. -Good morning. Get me the keys. Close the door. Ya, tell me. Yesterday you were looking very beautiful in the red saree. Yes! My heart has taken a stray detour. My age is skipping the boundaries. My heart has taken a stray detour. My age is skipping the boundaries. When you say, 'hi' The smile on my lips doesn't wipe off at all. Till the moment I saw you stretching your body parts, I never knew this much beauty could exist on this earth. An unknown wooziness surrounded me. I have no other way left. Please spare a look at me. My heart has taken a stray detour. My age is skipping the boundaries. My heart has taken a stray detour. My age is skipping the boundaries. The air-stroke caused by the slipping of your saree has caused my heart to skip a beat. I have taken up the job of skipping sleeps at night because of you. Your birth-mole… I am a fan of it… That's why I came to you and nothing could stop me on the way. My heart has taken a stray detour. My age is skipping the boundaries. My heart has taken a stray detour. My age is skipping the boundaries. This life has wished for a sweet crime to be committed. This unquenchable thirst is causing hiccups to me. By standing far away you are betraying me. Your dimples are as beautiful as raining flowers. I'll take you away without anybody's knowledge. My heart has taken a stray detour. My age is skipping the boundaries. My heart has taken a stray detour. My age is skipping the boundaries. Can I ask you one question? Ask. Is your husband romantic? A lot. How do you know? How will I not know? What are you talking about? Okay. Okay. -I'll ask you another question. Who is the better cook? You or your neighbour? Me. How do you know? Because I have tasted her badly cooked dishes many times. Now tell me, how do you know that your husband is romantic? Hello. Yes, dear. Today night I have duty on the Denduluru highway. I won't be coming home tonight. Take care and sleep well. Okay, I'll talk to you later. Is your husband romantic? How do you know? Is your husband romantic? How do you know? I want to know whether my husband is romantic or not. Yes! What is this? Do not touch me without my permission. Sorry. I mean you can touch me after taking my permission. One minute. Just a minute. My husband. He will call me now. Hello. -What are you doing? I was getting bored so I was watching TV. There are no new movies. Chitram on Etv, Prema Katha Chitram on Maa Tv, Rx100 on Gemini. But you don't like such movies. But I'm bored being alone. Why don't you come early? I'll be there in 10 mins. -What? I'll be there in 10 mins. -Okay. My husband won't be coming till morning 10. Why did you hit me? Light. Okay. My husband! Didn't you say he won't come? How would I know? Why didn't the bike not make any sound? What stupid questions are you asking me at this time? If he sees both of us together, he would kill us. Get out from here, go. Where should I go? Hide somewhere. Coming. Fast, fast. Go inside. Get inside. Actually… I forgot my shoes inside. Didn't I tell you that he would kill you if he finds you? Go, get inside. Coming. Coming. Why did it take so long? I was asleep. Are you hungry? Shall I serve dinner? -No. I made chicken sambhar and rasam just for you. What? Chicken gravy and rasam. Will you have some? -No. Will you sleep? Where are you going? To take a bath. -Bath? Why? -Nothing. I thought I would heat up the water first. No need. Hey… What happened? Rat. -Come out. Come out. I'll take care of it. You come out. It's okay, you leave. I'll kill it if I find it. My husband would sleep after having four pegs. I'll send you out then. Wait for my signal. What is that? Milk. -Get it here. Are you not drinking alcohol today? I'm not in the mood to drink. Do I look like an alcoholic pisshead to be sloshed all the time? Switch off the light and sleep. Dear? Dear? What happened? I don't feel sleepy. Now try to sleep, you would. I'm helpless. God, save me. What a dialogue delivery! Super! That's why Ram is such a huge fan of Balayya. True. Where is Bobby? I don't know. You don't know? We have the project submission tomorrow. We have to submit our project as well, right? Hello. -Where are you? Inside the bathroom. -What? You have been in the bathroom since evening? What happened? Not in our bathroom. I'm in Devika's bathroom. Devika? Put it on speaker. Who is Devika? Devika is.. Please don't laugh. Her husband is an SI. You are no less than a Romeo. You have aimed to annex a policeman's property! If he finds me, he will shoot me at point-blank range. Later you won't have anyone to complete your projects. Okay. Don't fret yourself. We'll take care of it. Where is the address? I'm sharing it with you. What can we do now ? Bobby is in deep shit. We have to rescue him. Where is Ram? Why bother him? Let's go and save him. If you tell this to him, he'll shit his pants and refuse to accompany us. Where wouldn't I accompany you two? In the neighbouring village… Why are you stopping him? In the neighbouring village… Rave party. -Rave party? Rave party would be full of drinks, food and a whole lot of dancing. I'll come along with you. Party! Party! Shut up. You always avoid me. -Let him come. Let's go, dude. Party! Party! Party! Dude, get me a peg! Turn it up! Party! Party! Stop it. Nonsense. Do you know the origin of the rave parties? I don't know. You... They used to call them 'Bogamela'. It would be in full swing in the festive seasons. But then the government officially banned it. So now it has been reimagined as rave parties. The people attending rave parties are very open-minded… unlike you… Siddha… You said it's the neighbouring village. What's the name of this village? Kamapuram. Kamapuram? The name itself has a vibration to it. I wonder how much more vibration will I find in the place! Kamapuram! I'm coming. I don't understand if this is a legitimate village or not. What sort of question is that? There are people around you. There is a panchayat system in place. Moreover, you have the president in front of you. Along with all this, there are many thieves as well. So what shall I do? Shall I cancel all my pilgrimage trips and become a watchman at your house? You are not understanding the intensity of the situation, sir. Excuse me. Get me a pack of cigarettes. How rude of you! Can't you get down your cycle? Thieves are roaming all around. If you are careless even a tad bit, they are stealing you off your own clothes. Okay. Why are you laughing? They stole your cycle already. Where is my cycle? Did you call this Panchayat for your rusty cycle? Bloody fool. Stop. Don't tell. Stop. Ramulu… Don't make me a laughing stock. - Let her talk. - Stop it. Sir. Somebody stole my purse from within my blouse in broad daylight. Didn't you notice them taking away your purse in broad daylight? I didn't think they had put their hands in for the purse. Ramulu… beware! You must help us, sir. I have an idea. Ladies would be on watch in the day and men would be on watch during the nights. Problem solved. We agree to it! We don't agree with it! Why? His idea seems to be good. If ladies are on watch during the day and men during the night then when will they spend time with each other? The romantic nights once in a Blue Moon shouldn't be a cause of concern. - Well said! - That's it. If you are that horny, sleep with a piece of wet cloth on your face. Today onwards, everyone will be on a watch in shifts. Where is Bobby? -In SI's home. In SI's home? What crime did he commit? He is there to tutor the SI's wife for her maths exam. Is her husband not good at maths? He is too weak it seems. Okay. Anyway, one must agree that Bobby is a genius at maths. Stop that car. Stop that car. Where are you going? Where is SI house? It's the second house from that lane. Why? My friend and SI's wife… My friend is missing, sir. We are here to complain about that. Is there any common fair happening in the village? We are not here to enjoy the fair. We are here on a watch against the thieves who have targeted our village. Is it? Thrash them a bit extra on my behalf too. That is the SI's house. Take care of him for 10 minutes, meanwhile, I'll conceive a plan to escape Bobby. Ram? Where is he? [Singing folk song] Hey, Ram. Stop. Wait a minute. Let's make a plan. What plan are you talking about? We are getting late for the party. Hey! How will you get him out? How will I get him out? I'll knock on SI's door, then I'll ask him, "Sir, if your wife is done with my friend please let him go. We are getting late to a party". That's it. Simple! He will not send him along with you. He will send both of you to heaven. Why will he kill us? He is not here to tutor SI's wife. Then? Her husband was away on night duty… So? If he is away on night duty, she will be lonely, right? He was here to give her company. You guys tricked me with an excuse for a rave party! SI would kill him later, first, he will have to face the wrath of my Balayya. Ram…You can't walk on us, promise on Balayya! You locked me using my weakness Balayya. Shit! Okay. Tell me what the plan is. We shall knock on his door and engage him in conversation. Meanwhile, his wife would send Bobby out from the back door. Siddha! In a village, at 10:30 in the night, what conversation will you have with the SI? Is he your childhood buddy? So, we need a strong reason to knock on SI's door. It should be an emergency. Who are you? -Sir, an accident took place in Kakinada. Yes, sir! He is severely wounded and he has been admitted to ICU, sir. Yea, sir! We enquired about him and found out that he is from your village. Hi! Yes, sir! Great plan. Vicky, get the car to the back entrance and pick Bobby up from there. We shall indulge SI in our conversations. Hey, don't knock on the door. Why? -There is no back entrance to this house. What? There is no back entrance? Call him. What happened? Hey. Come here. Who are you all? What do you want? Sir, we are JNTU students from Kakinada. We are four friends, sir. We are always together, sir. The fourth one is Bobby, sir. Due to some unprecedented reasons, he is now stuck in a bathroom while doing math. Why are you telling me Bobby's history? Tell me the reason why you are here. Sir, an accident took place in Kakinada. He is in a critical position, sir. We enquired about him and found out that he is from your village. We didn't know whom we should inform. So we came to your house. Yes sir - What's his name? - Srinu sir, Vasu sir. - Is that Srinu or Vasu? - Srinivas sir. - Randomly he was called Srinu & Vasu. - Yes sir. Bobby! I've recently been transferred to this village. Wait for a while. Dear.. Do you know any Srinu in this village? I don't know him. I don't know. Enquire the neighbour Mahesh if he knows anything. She's hot! Did Bobby clear the maths exam? He must have got distinction. How do you know? Some answers are way too obvious. Mr. Mahesh? Mr. Mahesh? What a beauty! What a beauty! Sorry, I thought it was the old SI's wife. What can I do for you? Mahesh! Sir! Sir! Are you here as well? What is his name, sir? Srinu. Oh, Srinu? Yes, I know him. Pocha Srinu. If you search for a crook in Google, it will show you his name. What happened to him, sir? Srinu has had an accident in Kakinada. Srinu has had an accident? They informed me. They seem to be here on some crooked business. Ask any of his relatives to visit me. How was the movie? It was good. What Mahesh? What are you doing at SI sir's house at this time? You are here at the right time. Your friend Srinu has had an accident in Kakinada. Srinu has had an accident? Srinu has had an accident? This is not an accident, this is definitely an attempted murder. Who are you, brother? My middle name is Pulihora (tangy rice). My first name is Raja. Pulihora Raja, sir. How do say it is attempted murder? Yes, sir. I'm sure it is an attempt to murder. In the last Panchayat election, our Srinu contested against the current President. There was an intense fight between both of them. Out of that anger, he must have… Hey, Srinu… I won't spare you any more. How dare you contest against me? Your time's up. I'll definitely kill you. Everyone would assume your death to be an accident by a Lorry. Lorry? -Yes, Lorry. Your time's up! Sir, I'm sure this accident was planned by the President. I'll show you the proof. How did the accident happen? Some Lorry hit him. There you go, sir. I'll give you more proofs, sir. Call srinu. Call him. It is switched off, bro. -Did you notice, sir? Now call the President. This is switched off as well. There you go, sir. What more proof do you want, sir? He is the one responsible for the accident, sir. Yes, sir! We shall avenge our friend, sir. Come, let's kill that President. Stop there. First of all, we must confirm the accident and identity of Srinu. Then it must be confirmed whether the President is behind that accident or not. And later, we must take appropriate legal action. Give me a minute, I'll get ready. Let's go to Kakinada. My husband…My husband… …is going to Kakinada. My husband…My husband… …is going to Kakinada. I'll send Bobby away! Bob…Bob... Bob…Bob… I'll send Bobby away! Bob…Bob... Bob…Bob… I would never repeat this ever. You are as great as my Balayya, sir. Hey, let me speak. If sir was not there, there would have been four murders in this village. Whose murder? What if the Srinu in the hospital is their friend Srinu and the President was responsible for his accident? Keep your mouth shut dude. If I'm wrong, kill me. Kill me! You have a point there. Did you hear? Mahesh. -yes, coming sir Sir? What about the President? He is gone on a devotional tour. And his family? Everyone Including ladies and children, are at home, sir. Do one thing. -Sir. Get their whole family to my house. Actually… I didn't expect this twist. Even if something goes wrong, nobody will dare to attack the house of an SI. Sometimes it happens, dude. Come here. No. -I say, come here. Idiot. Why did you get down before me, Shashikala? Are you trying to dominate me? Nothing like that mother-in-law. I was in your way. You get down, mother-in-law. Hey, Chandrakala! You reprimanded her but made the same mistake yourself. Aren't you going off-limits? If I was off-limits, I would have been healthier like you instead I'm just skinny and scrawny. Get down. I can see right through your sarcasm! Hey, driver. Thieves are roaming around in the village. Go fast and keep a watch on the house. This seems like a TikTok family, dude. If they enter the house, it will be very difficult to get Bobby out. It's because of this idiot. If you hit me again, I'll tell the whole truth to him. -Jai Balayya! Jai Balayya! Excuse me, I heard that Srinu has had an accident. We felt sorry for him. He should have died in that accident. Ladies, stop your bickering and come inside. She is Shashikala and her name is Chandrakala. What is your name? Lakshmikala, you fool! Do you expect me to treat you with respect? There was no minimum respect here. Get inside, quick. Take care of them until I return. Don't open the door for anyone else other than me. You! -Yes, sir. Did you guys admit Srinu to the hospital? Yes, sir. Which hospital? -Kakinada General Hospital. Do one thing, one of you accompany me for guidance. Not you. He seems to be sharp. What's your name? Ram, sir. Come. -Okay. Take care, bro. -Why do you say that? Chant Balayya's name if you are scared. You both chant my name if you are scared! Yes, tell me. Fortunately, there was a Srinu in the village. But there is no guarantee that a Srinu will be present in the hospital, especially in the ICU ward. Look at them! If they find out that you were lying all this while, they will shear you into pieces. Then, your Balayya too can't save you. Go. -Come. Coming. Jai Balayya! Jai Balayya! Why is she worried so much? I don't know. Hey, girl. -Won't you offer anything to your guests? What will you have? Stop staring at me and get me something to drink. Why are you silent? Tell her to get something to drink. Juice for me. Boost for my mother-in-law and coffee for her mother-in-law. Hey, girl. Rearrange it. Coffee for her mother-in-law, Boost for my mother-in-law and juice for me. Okay, I'll get it. What about me? Wait, my husband has gone out. Then send me out. Wait! Not now. My husband has gone out but another 7-8 people have entered the house. I'll open the door when I get the opportunity. Wait until then. Call Ram and get the updates. The call is not reachable. Did they find out about Srinu's absence? Is Srinu not there? What are you hiding from me? Nothing, sir. What is it? What is the problem, Mahesh? I doubt their intentions. I think they don't know our Srinu. Let's treat them well and they will tell truth automatically. No need for any violence. Identify Srinu in this group photo. Why are you taking so long to identify him? Aren't you the ones who admitted him to the hospital? identify him? Who is this Sreenu in this picture. They are here to help our friend and you are doubting them? You will always be a dumbhead. Stop wasting time with him, let's go. How did you correctly identify him? Look there. Look here. Look all around you. You are a genius. The posters saved us for the day. Plan something to save Bobby as well. Do something. Do you think we don't know that you have sent your husband out and hid your boyfriend in the bathroom? That's not true. That's not true. Not true… That's not true, mom. You scolded me for not serving him lunch when he came in the afternoon. Then you scolded me for not serving him tea when he came in the evening. So today when he came in the night, I asked him if he wanted to sleep. I did nothing wrong, mom. I wanted to ask how much sugar you like in your coffee. Three spoons for me. Two spoons for my mother-in-law and one spoon for her mother-in-law. Looking at her reaction, I believe she definitely has someone in her bathroom. I don't think so. I know, I am right. How do you know? Experience! Poor father-in-law! Stop giggling and tell me how should we find him. I'll ask her if I need to use the washroom. If she agrees to it, that means there is no one here. If she asks me to use the washroom that's outside, then for sure somebody is in there. Okay. Okay. She's here. Please have it. Please take me to the washroom. I'm diabetic. I need to use it frequently. You have sinned, Sridevi. I won't spare you. Stupid daily soaps! They disturb us a lot, don't they? Show me the washroom. This bathroom is rather slippery. There is another washroom on the outside. Shall I take you there? Didn't you see Srinu's friends outside? What if they assault us? What if they attack us? What if they kill us? I'll better use this bathroom. Come. Go, show her. Srinu! Srinu! I won't spare that President. Do you have any Srinu admitted to the ICU? Wait, I'll check. -I'll kill you if he isn't there. There is an unidentified accident case. Thank you, Nurse. Are you from Kamapuram? Yes. -I get it. Go inside and confirm whether it is your friend or not. One at a time, please. Jampa, you go first. Go. He is not our Srinu. He is not? You also visit him once and clear the doubt. -Go. He is our Srinu, sir. He is our Srinu, sir. Same height and the same width. I'll kill the President, sir. The President has… -Stop. Someone go in and confirm again. -Raju, you go in. How many times will they go? God! He is not our Srinu. Do you have a photo? Come with me. What happened to him? Why it was happened like this? I can't see anything. I forgot my glasses in a hurry. Let me open the lid. God, I can't. Wait. I can't see anything. There is no sound as well. I shall try looking from a distance. It is so congested here. Show up. Shit! Couldn't they have a larger bathroom? I escaped that by a whisker! Thank God! - Use these medicine's. - Ok sir. Sir, what a pleasant surprise! How are you? I'm good. How are you? Fine, sir. What are you doing here? I don't think this is your jurisdiction. I came here to identify the person involved in the accident. I couldn't recognize him. Can I look at his face? You can't see his face for another five days. What can we do? How will I identify him? We racked our brains the whole evening to identify him before the treatment but then we saw all his gold ornaments and expected him to be from a rich background. So we started the treatment. There is chaos happening in the village because of his accident. Can we take him to the village in an ambulance and safely get him back? According to the hospital's rules, such a thing is not allowed. But since you are saying it will be a law and order situation, you can! Thank you, sir. -Okay. You may carry on with your work. Is he there? There is nothing in that bathroom except an old box to store dirty linens. I'm sure he must be in that box. I don't think so. I'm damn sure about it. How can you be so sure? Experience! Poor father-in-law. Stop giggling and think about what will be our next plan. SI will be back in the village in a few minutes and the President's family is inside the house. How will we get Bobby out? We shall switch off the main power supply of this village. Bobby can use the darkness and escape. Send a message to him. We shall switch off the power supply whenever he's ready. Why are you sitting idle? Why don't you play something? What shall we play? Play hide and seek. Come. Come. Let's go. What happened to you? -You have bad hiccups! Come, come sit here. Sit! Sit… Have this juice. Let the children play, you have a seat here. -Sit down. 7…8…9…10 Beware, thieves! The police is coming. What happened? I can't find anyone. Ask me. I'll help you. Go to the kitchen. Okay. Nobody is there. Check the storeroom. Nobody is there either. Search the bedroom. Okay! What happened to you? Why are sweating profusely even though it's quite cold? Out. Out. Out. -I got a thief. I need to find two more. Don't be silent. Please say something. Don't worry. The plan will work out fine. Look in the dirty linen's box in the bathroom. You will surely find a thief. -Okay! I'll join you too. Hey, Bobby's message. Do it very fast. My situation is very bad. Come. Let's execute our plan. Who switched off the power supply? How does that matter? Let's go and get Bobby out. The thieves are doing this every midnight. Cutting the main power supply and looting the houses. You guys go that way and you all come along with me. -Okay, bro. We will not spare them. How dare you fool me! I won't spare you. Now you know them. I can't see properly. Chandrakala! -What happened? Look here if it is one or two people standing in front of me. Father-in-law should have killed this lady instead of Srinu. It's only one person. My eyesight has become too poor. Is he our Srinu? Why are you silent? There is nothing left to identify. Does that mean he is no good in bed? Srinu! Who will sneak into my house in the absence of my husband? Who will amuse us in our leisure time? You caused us an unbearable loss! [incomprehensible cries] Excuse…Excuse… Open the door. Why did you die so early, Srinu? Srinu… Srinu… Hey buddy, where is Bobby? Had the power cut extended for another two minutes, Bobby would have been here. What shall we do? If they find out that he is not their Srinu, they will round us up. Let's escape from here. Stop. Let's wait for a couple more minutes. Where is Srinu's mother? Look, what they did to our Srinu! Srinu! What is your next plan? The whole village believes that he is their Srinu. Let's spark a rift between the two gangs which will get them busy. SI will be busy controlling the situation and meanwhile, Bobby will have enough time to escape. Jai Balayya! Do you really think the President caused this accident? Do you still doubt his involvement? I'm sure! We are sure! They couldn't attack him inside the village hence marked a spot in Kakinada. Allegedly… Get the weapons out. They tricked Srinu into leaving the village and backstabbed him. Not one person from their gang will be spared. Get the weapons. We don't need to trick him into coming to Kakinada. We can kill him right here. [incomprehensible fights] (Undistinguished arguments) [incomprehensible fights] Bobby, come fast. Come fast. Hello. What a plan! Extraordinary plan, Siddhu. Super! No one can stop this. How come he is here? Continue fighting. We can escape easily from here. (Undistinguished arguments) Why did you stop? Continue. Do you know why we are fighting? -Why? Because the President caused a fatal accident to you. Who said that? What a plan! Extraordinary plan, Siddhu. Super! Bloody thieves! This was your plan all along, wasn't it? Mahesh bro! You were right, they are thieves. They plan to keep the village busy and then loot everything and escape in their car. Was that your plan? Yes, sir. Why did you commit to being a thief? If we tell the truth, Bobby will be in danger. - Jai Balayya! - Jai Balayya! I'm warning every one of you. Stop the fight. Go back to your house. Leave. What about those thieves? I'll take care of them. Okay. Come… come… Where were you? Where had you been? Come, I'll tell you later. You are such a good soul, I feel sorry for you. You solve the village's problem. Who will solve your problem? Visit the bathroom frequently, you will find the truth. Good night, sir. I'll take your leave. Let's go. Let's go. Don't you have anything worthwhile to do? What were they hinting me at? I didn't tell anything to me. I swear, I didn't tell them anything. You gave away my pile's problem to them, didn't you? I was gone for one hour and you leaked all our secrets to them. Are you going to the station? No. Are you going early in the morning? I won't be going to the station for three more days. -Three more days?! Why are you so shocked? Surprised! Check your glass either is in it? The moment I pop, I go crazy… What is this nuisance? Do you think you are an esteemed guest here? Thank you, sir. I wasn't able to sit down. Thanks for your help. Which case? My friend Bobby and SI's wife… Will you shut your mouth! We are charged with robbery. You are my colleagues. Hey, head constable…Why are you calling him? Come here. Wait, I'll arrange a tea party for you. Wait and watch. Hello! -What is it? My colleagues are here, get them some tea. We don't want anything, sir. -Why settle for tea? I'll get you all boost! Add some extra sugar. Constables! Serve them the boost. Please, sir. -No, sir. [indistinct shouting] Are you hurt? I think I have swelling. Ice is a good option to reduce inflammation. Head constable! What is it again? My friends are experiencing body pains. Get them some ice. Ice won't work, I'll send painkillers for you. Don't act smart. Do what I say. Idiot. [indistinct shouting] I'll smash you. Was that enough or do you want more? -I'll ask you when I need it. Do you think we are free? Who are you? A brother from another mother! - You idiot! - Your daddy. Leave him. Let us go and sit on the other side. You are sitting along with the prostitutes. It's a shame to our profession! [Random conversation] Siddha! That girl is signalling me… My boy isn't weak to fall for your seduction. We are thieves. If you like him, give him your address. He will come at night and steal all that is available. Bloody drunkard! Siddha! I'm sure he will book us in a murder case. Get lost. I have an idea. The policemen are busy. This is the right time. Let's escape. Good idea. Constables! Keep quiet. We are planning an escape. -You carry on! Get him away. Go away. You are taking things very lightly. Let our CI sir come. He will make you pee in your pants. What can your CI do? Ask the President of Kaamapuram about the capabilities of our CI. Are you the President of Kaamapuram? Don't ask me anything. Don't rat me out to anyone. The villagers said you are out on pilgrimage! And, I got raided over there. Which pilgrimage? In our village, pilgrimage means this… What about the CI? He is a God for the good ones and Dad for the bad ones. To put it in simple words, he is Mad! Why do you worry? Is it your first time? Yes, sir. I'll tell him that we are friends. What is your address? It is the birthday of freedom fighter Ajay Mallya. Don't you know that it's a dry day? Don't you know that liquor selling is prohibited for the day? How dare you sell liquor! How dare you sell liquor! He seems very violent! -How dare you sell liquor! He has lost consciousness. I will continue with one more round when he is back into his senses. Inject saline into him. Excuse me… -Sir? Who are they? Brothel case, sir. Brothel? Then the President of Kaamapuram must be here? I'm here, sir. Love you, dear. You come here every month with utmost dedication. Shall we start? You come here every month with utmost dedication. Shall we start? If you are caught in raiding again, I'll kill you with my bare hands. I don't mind the death, my soul will still wander that area. You may start the program. Are you sure? Hundred per cent! Learn the art of thrashing from CI. -Go to your place. Sir, your shirt is wrinkled. Please change it. Who are they?- Kaamapuram robbery case, sir. Come here. You all seemed to be healthy, why don't you work and earn for yourself? How dare you steal! Jai Balayya! Jai Balayya! Jai Balayya! Why are you chanting his name? Which Balayya? Nandamuri Balayya? -Yes, sir. The one who is co-brother cum in-law to the great politician Chandra Babu Naidu? Yes, sir. Are you a fan of Balayya? Yes, sir. Me too a fan of Balayya. But I hate you, dear. It's hard to believe that you are a fan of Balayya. Because Balayya's fan cannot commit any mistake. I swear on my mother, I am a fan of Balayya. You are younger than Balayya's entire career span. What do you know about him? What do I know about him? How can you ask such a silly question to me? What do you know about him? Have you seen his love? Have you seen his anger? Have you witnessed his ferocious avatar? Have you witnessed his tranquillity? Do you know that he is a wonder? I will tell you about him. Listen carefully… Balayya is Shri. NTR's 6th child. His birthdate is 10th June 1960. He made his debut with Tatamma Kala in 1974 and won the award of best child actor for his first film. Narasimha Naidu, Simha and Legend. He is a great actor who won Filmfare awards for his acting He won Filmfare awards for Gautamiputra Satakarni and Sri Rama Rajyam. He has also won Akkineni Abhinaya Puraskaram for his contributions to cinema. Leave aside all the awards and rewards, let's talk about records. Samarasimha Reddy - 30 centres, 175 days. Narasimha Naidu - 109 centres, 100 days. He is a legend in the history of Telugu cinema. Not only in cinema, but he is also taken the reigns of Basavatarakam Cancer Hospital which was founded by his father into his own hands and helped numerous needy people. He has a golden heart, sir. Days are not enough to sing his praises, sir. Not enough! A fan is not the one who buys the ticket for the first-day first show. The one who manifests the actor in his every breath and remembers him with every heartbeat, he is the real fan. I am proud to say that I am a fan of Balayya. Any doubts? That is the greatness of power star Pawan Kalyan. Excuse my mistake. A fan is not the one who buys the ticket for the first-day first show. The one who manifests the actor in his every breath and remembers him with every heartbeat, he is the real fan. I am proud to say that I am a fan of Balayya. Any doubts? That is Balayya for you! Dear, you are a fan of Balayya. I believe you. But you are not a die-hard fan. Why do you think I'm not a die-hard fan of Balayya? Boys! -Girls! Jai Balayya! -Jai Jai Balayya! Jai Balayya! -Jai Jai Balayya! Lemon tart, Apple tart… Balayya is in our heart! - Idli, dosa… - Balayya resides in our breath! Maaza Frooti… Balayya is naughty! Maaza Frooti… Balayya is naughty! Maaza Frooti… Balayya is naughty! Maaza Frooti… Balayya is naughty! Brother, now I wholeheartedly believe that you are a fan of Balayya. But I don't believe that you are a die-hard fan of Balayya. Why do you say so? Where is the finishing touch for the anthem, sir? Coca-Cola, Pepsi… Balayya is sexy! Coca-Cola, Pepsi… Balayya is sexy! I've met a hard-core fan of Balayya after many many days. You have rejuvenated my energy. Thank you, Sir. -Why did you come to Kaamapuram? Sir, as you know, today is the birth anniversary of the freedom fighter Ajay Mallya. It is a dry day. You won't get liquor anywhere else other than Kaampauram. That's the reason for our visit, sir. Is it the same brand, brother? Is it the same brand, brother? -Sir? Sir… Enjoy. I'm letting you go since it was for liquor. But if it was a case involving a girl, I would have encountered you. I don't want to see you in the vicinity ever. Once we step out of this station, we won't even meet each other, sir. We will go on our separate paths. What should I do? What should I do? I have committed a mistake for the first time in my life and I am bearing an insurmountable punishment for that. He never takes an off and now he has taken an off for three whole days. How will I send Bobby out? I am not able to think straight. Do you know what our problem is? We prefer to run away from the problem rather than find a solution for that. You have a problem with your husband but you are searching for the solution to the medicines prescribed by the doctor. These tablets might make you drowsy but won't solve your problems. What am I supposed to do? Confront him one on one. That's the only solution. I need to talk to you. We can talk in the morning. I need to confess something. What is it? The thing is… -Make it fast. When I went to town to write the exam… Exam? Which exam? I am continuing my studies. Why didn't you inform me? There is a matter which is more important than that. What is it? When I went to write my exams, I befriended a boy named Bobby. You said you won't come home for the night. So, I called him over. But all of a sudden you came back and I hid him in the bathroom. Nothing happened between us. Swear on you! Don't you trust me? No! Please, don't. I beg you. don't. I beg you. I beg you. Bobby is a nice guy. Hey, Bobby. Come out. Bobby is a nice guy. He is a college topper. He even secured a job in campus placements. Please don't harm him. Please. Don't. Please. Please, listen to me. Why did you tell him that we will be going our separate ways? He must have not meant it. No. I mean it. You mean it? Where are you going? We studied hard for the last four years. Let's go back to the hostel and finish our project. Then our life and career will be on track. We are not going to college without Bobby. Take us back. Take a U-turn. I say, take us back to Bobby. -I won't. Turn back. Vicky, stop. Take your hands off. Stop, you two. Stop fighting. Please, listen to me. Tell that to him. Stop fiddling with the steering. Stop it. Stop! You idiots, we'll be in danger if anything goes wrong. He is a selfish fellow. Siddhu, mind your words. Why did I come this far? For whom did I sit in the police station? Will I do all this if I was selfish? There is a limit to everything, bro. Our parents have struggled a lot to get us a good education. They will be very happy to see us settled in a job. Our parents should be our priority. Is it fair that for one guy, just one guy, all three of us suffer? He is our friend. Okay. Given a choice between friendship and career, I will choose my career. My career! Moreover, he has done something extraordinary. He is a characterless fellow who trapped a married woman. Cut the crap, man. Are you coming with us or not? Ram, let's go. Ram, think about it. Don't blindly follow him. If you are caught this time around, the SI will definitely kill you. You called him characterless. You are leaving alone your friend who is in trouble, how should I judge your character? No matter how grave his mistakes are, ultimately he is our friend. Bobby made a grave mistake, no? Huge one. He deserves all the punishment. No. He deserves to die. He is a college topper, he could have had a gang of nerd friends but he chose to sit on the last bench, along with the below-average students like us. He is definitely wrong. He is not from a middle-class family. He is very rich. Yet, he shared our rooms. He is definitely wrong. When we bunked the classes for our favourite star's cinema, he burned his midnight oil to explain the concepts to us. I used to always pull his leg, never did he take any offence to anything. Why are you lecturing me with this crap? He did it because we were his friends. So, we were his friends and he is not our friend. Is that what you are implying? What did you say? That our parents struggled to make us educated? But when did we study? Do you remember, in the second year when you had backlogs in all the subjects, you were about to commit suicide with the fear of your parent's wrath? He has been carrying us since then. He is our hero. If he is in this problem, it is because of us. We made him try cigarettes, we made him try alcohol and pulled his leg for not having a girlfriend. And now that he is in trouble, I can't leave him alone. Hey, where are you up to? I might be a coward. But I'm not selfish like you. Siddhu. Sorry, bro. Sorry, bro. Sorry, bro. Sorry, bro. Sorry, bro. Sorry. Let's get Bobby back. We don't have much time. Bobby is waiting for us. We don't know what is his situation back there. Bloody fool. Have you gone blind? No. I have just had them opened. Jai Balayya! -Come on. If you think Bobby is wrong, get him out; give him a tight slap and question him how can he seduce a married woman? But you don't desert a friend in need. Check out. -It's a girl. Hello. Are you okay? Madam. Madam. Madam… Please, madam. Who are you? What happened to you? Handover that girl to us. Do you know who we are? You are chasing a girl at midnight and then boasting about your identity!? Bloody fools. No, brother. I said no. Get out of our way. Siddhu! I'll see your end. You are finished today. Wait… Wait… Get in my sight when you are in Kakinada, I'll see your end! Where is the girl? She was here. She was right here. Where is she? She is not in the car either. We saved her from the goons at midnight. And she didn't even thank us. We are men too. She must have been scared. Nevermind. Let's go. Since the thieves were apprehended, the villagers must be fast asleep. We shall leave the car here and walk up to SI's house. I don't know the rest of the plan but we are getting Bobby out. Jai Balayya! Somebody is coming. It's the time when ghosts roam around; who is he? Is he gone? Look properly. He is gone. Get up. He came again. -He is right here. Nobody is in here. Shall I call out people? Why have they come back to the village? Are you here for Sattipandu's daughter? Are you here for Kukkalrao's sister? Apparao's daughter has a boyfriend, Ramesh. Subbarao's daughter has many boyfriends. 3:4:99, with all the permutations and combinations none of the girls in this village is single as per my knowledge. Then why are you here? -For alcohol. Let's go to my house. Why? -For alcohol. Listen to me… -Don't get tempted. I'm perfect at pouring the peg, you won't find any fault with the level. Have it. What are those photos? Who are they? My grandfather, Thoothukudi Thatharao. My father, Thoothukudi Paparao. Why are they surrounded by white girls? My grandfather was a freedom fighter? My grandfather belongs to the first generation of freedom fighters who wreak havoc on Britishers. What about your father, sir? He was involved in secret donations. What about you, sir? I'm carrying forward their legacy. Sir, there are no ladies. I mean, I don't see any of your family members. Have they gone out? I don't have a family. I'm single but I always mingle. Aren't you married? No, I am not married. The villagers must have refused to give their girl's hand to him. If I say yes, there are hundreds of people ready to give their daughter's hand into my hands. But, I hate girls. Why do you hate girls? Confusion! Confusion! They don't know what they want. If you call them multiple times, they'll be like: don't you have any other job? If you don't call, they'll be like: you are not interested in me anymore. If you try to get intimate, they'll call you a pervert. If you don't try anything, they'll call you unromantic. Finally, I concluded that girls, love, marriage and relationships are cotton business. I mean, useless business. You didn't understand? Let me explain it to you briefly. Look there. Devdas' life was ruined by Paro. Manju had a sad life due to Laila. No one in history has flourished in his life who has surrendered himself to his girlfriend. They strike you with blades with just a glance. They carve out your heart, don't ever get mad behind them. They rule your life with a rod in hand and with their innocent smile, they disintegrate you into pieces, dude. Devdas' life was ruined by Paro. Manju had a sad life due to Laila. No one in history has flourished in his life who has surrendered himself to his girlfriend. Sir, this is too much. I agree that girls cause some trouble in life. But that doesn't mean we must turn into a saint for that. Do we stop using our vehicles just because petrol prices have increased? Do we stop using the fan because we are being billed outrageously for electricity consumption? Brothers… You misunderstood me. Yes, we must use the fan. But its bill must be paid by the neighbours. Yes, we must use the vehicle. But the petrol must be sponsored by the neighbours. How? -This is how. Try teasing the neighbourhood aunty, she will serve you tiffin. Try flirting with another neighbourhood aunty, she will serve you full meals. If the aunty is rich, she will pay you through Google pay. She won't cause you any trouble but solve all your problems. Celebrate every night and morning with her and quench the thirst of your youth. Instead of maintaining girlfriends who are torturous in their behaviour better try an aunty who is much better than a girlfriend. If you marry someone, you will have just one head office. If you skip marriage, you will have multiple branches. Even after all this enlightenment if you choose to ignore me, there's no bigger idiot than you in this world. Devdas' life was ruined by Paro. Manju had a sad life due to Laila. No one in history has flourished in his life who has surrendered himself to his girlfriend. Girls are scrap! Aunties are the best! Girls are scrap! Aunties are the best! Girls are scrap! Aunties are the best! Girls are scrap! Aunties are the best! Girls are scrap! Aunties are the best! Girls are scrap! Aunties are the best! Now tell me, where is your friend?- In the SI's house. Is he really inside SI's house? Mr. Mahesh? Mr. Mahesh? I will save your friend. But what is in it for me? Do you want money? Who needs your money? Who needs it? Tell me if you want money, I will give it to you. Sir, what do you want? Devika should know that I have saved him and make your friend praise me in front of her. Introduce me to her. Then? Mahesh is a nice person. Mahesh has a good heart. Mahesh is a great person. Mahesh is the God who saved us. Though he cannot be seen in the dark yet he is the God who has filled light in our lives. How can I return your favour, sir? No. I don't take anything from men. Mahesh! Had it not been for you, our lives would have been shattered. Will you spend at least one hour every day with me? If you agree, I will spend every hour with you. You are God! God! -Not there. Your place is here. Here! That's it! How will you go to the SI's house? What will you say to him? I'm not an amateur like you to knock on the doors of the SI. Do you know me? Do you know my legacy? Thoothukudi Mahesh, son of Thoothukudi Paparao, son of Thoothukudi Thatharao, freedom fighter. What is this, sir? Come. Where has he gotten us to? What is this, sir? -It's a tunnel. It's a tunnel. I had a strong connection with the wife of the previous SI. Why is it so dark? Wait a minute. Has this shocked you? Are you shaken up? I knew that tunnels were dug up to escape from Jail and during wartime. For the first time, I have experienced some digging up a tunnel to carry on an affair. That is my speciality. A real man is the one who digs up a tunnel to the pleasures of heaven. What are these pictures? Having moods (condom) is very important in the field that I've chosen. Similarly, being in the mood is also very important. Come. -Pervert! Who is he? What the hell is this tunnel? What are we doing here? How long will it take? We've reached the location. Hi, Shakuntala. -Why are you here? My husband is at home. Am I scared of your husband? Get lost. Saku…Saku… I have come this far. -Please give me something before I leave. I am not giving you anything, get lost. -Saku…Saku… Nowadays, he has been staying at home more often. What happened, sir? -Wrong address. How can it be the wrong address? Didn't you say that you have dug up this tunnel for the wife of the previous SI. Look, brother. The government does not lay roads to only SI's house, they lay it down to every house. One can use the ways as per their requirements. I did the same. He is the most perverted person I've seen in my life. I swear on my Balayya, I'll kill him. Calm down. Don't act smart. If you hurt his ego, he might even dig up a tunnel leading to your house post your marriage. Where are you? -Coming, sir. (Song Humming) Which way should we head? Don't confuse yourself and don't confuse me as well. I'm already confused. For this very purpose, I have the route map. Route map? -Yes. We have Saritha, Sulochana and Savitri's houses on the right. And Kumari, Kalyani and Kaveri's houses on the left. Towards the back, it is a dead end. So we must go straight. -Who are all of them? My customers. You, pervert. Aren't you ashamed of yourself? You belong to the family of a freedom fighter and yet indulge in such dishonourable acts. My grandfather is not the freedom fighter that you think of. In 1937, when the British and our fighters were busy fighting a battle, my grandfather dug up a tunnel to the Britisher's houses. What happened next? What do you expect? The white British women gave birth to brown children. Unable to bear that, the Britishers left our village 10 years before our country got freedom. That is my grandfather, Thoothukudi Thatharao. What do secret donations mean? Spreading of seeds Which seeds? The seeds of the human race. We've almost arrived. Call your friend. Bobby, listen to me carefully. I have been listening to you all evening. What are you guys doing? We are almost in the basement of the house you are in. Hello, why aren't you mentioning me? We took the help of the great Mr. Thoothukudi Mahesh and came here. Who is he? Where are you? -In the bathroom We can't get to the bathroom. Ask him to come to the storeroom. You, sucker. This ain't my room that I walk around freely. The bathroom door is locked from outside, the lights of the entire home are off. I don't even know the location of the storeroom. Give me the phone. I'll coordinate with him. Listen to me carefully. Get out of that box. Take two steps forward. Okay, sir. -Turn right and take three steps forward. Okay, sir. -What is your height? 5'7", sir. Then jump two feet in the air and you will find a rope. I got it, sir. Pull that rope and you will find a ladder. Climb the ladder and get up. I came up Sir. Don't forget to pull the ladder back up. People often get caught due to such silly mistakes. Crawl your way ahead. You will find a chicken coop. Did you find it? Yes, sir. There is a baby Python in it. -Sir? Baby Python? Just kidding. -A small joke. Sir, which way should I go now? -Take right. Your right or my right? My right. Why are you so slow? Buckle up your speed. Do you find the stacked up bale? Yes, sir. Take one step ahead and get up. I got up, sir. -Close your eyes and… Jump! Sir, I'm scared to jump. -That's why I asked you to jump. Sir? -Jump. Sir? -Jump. Jump. Did you jump? I jumped, sir. -He jumped. He landed safely. What do you see? I see the SI. -SI? I must have told him the address to the bedroom instead of the storeroom. Nothing to worry about. Just follow me. Come. Siddha, when did he change his shirt? Oh, shit. The door is locked. I have one more idea. Chloroform. What for? Don't underestimate it. This has helped me gain many pleasures in my life. What do you know about it? Okay. What is your plan? Follow me. How many more setups does he have -Wait. Don't climb. You might break it. Follow me. Wait and watch. I'll put this kerchief on the SI's face and he will pass out. We shouldn't have called him to the storeroom. He would have gotten him out by now. Exactly. The chloroform has its effect for another 4 hours. What shall we do now? It is all because of his shitty ideas. The priest can only officiate the wedding but cannot impose fornication between them. What can I do for his fault? Stop there. Bobby has lost his consciousness. We have only one way left. We need to get the thieves back into the village. How will we get them now? We are the thieves. How can we be thieves? -We shall hide our faces with masks, we will then go to the SI's house and knock on his door. As soon as he opens the door we will hit him with a rod, he will be incapacitated. We shall get Bobby and escape from here. Super idea. Let's go. -You go and get the car ready. Stop. How can you make a plan by yourselves? There is a senior standing right beside you Don't you have the common sense to discuss the plan with him? Don't you agree with our plan? How will it work out? You have plotted the plan until you escape Bobby, but what about you guys singing my praises to Devika and me hugging Devika, and you taking my blessings? How can you omit this part? Don't you have the obligation to discuss the plan? Sorry, sir. We forgot to discuss the plan with you. I can't keep reminding you all the time. Come along. Guys, stop. Forget about the hugs, blessings and kisses. At least introduce me to Devika. He didn't get the full clarity about our plan. Let us discuss with him again. Name a few movies where Balayya played a cop. Yes, sir. Rowdy Inspector, Lakshmi Narasimha, Inspector Prathap, Seema Simham. Have you seen him put up a comedy act while being in uniform? No, sir. Then why did you do so? They saved a girl from our guys, who was wanted as the suspect in two murders. We suspect them to be her accomplice in the murders. Sorry, sir. I didn't know that they were murderers. Did you follow the standard procedure? No, sir. Did you file an FIR? -No, sir. Did you at least conduct an inquiry? -No, sir. Look, mister. I am a fan of Balayya too. Sir. I love you, sir. We must preserve his ideals and principles but not at the stake of our duty. Sorry, sir. I will immediately file a murder case on them. I will find their whereabouts, find them, thrash them to pulp and hand them over to you within two hours, sir. Bro, why did you spoil it at the last minute? If we hit the SI and escape with Bobby, the next day they will investigate the entire thing and we will find ourselves in bigger trouble then. You are right. Who told all this to you? Swati? The girl whom we saved earlier. She was hiding inside our car boot. I'll help you get your friend out. Who are you? None of your business. Then we don't want your help. I'm not helping you, I'm helping the other lady. Our society is prejudiced about a man committing a mistake but an err from a woman gets her onto the roads irrespective of whether she's a mother, sister or daughter to someone. In the true sense, it's not your friend or you who is caught in trouble. It's that girl. Four men couldn't do anything and one frail little girl is saying that she'll move mountains and make seismic shifts you must be naive to trust her. Sister, you go home and watch some entertainment programmes on TV. Let's go. Why are you all upside down? Am I upside down? What is this? Ask her to get me down. Many ladies in this village are depending on me. Please, guys. Sister, I plead with you. Please leave me. I beg your mercy. Please, leave me. Ms. Swati, come along with us. Thank you, sister. Kaamapuram playboy must be shaken. Take care of yourself. Where is your friend? In that house. -In the bedroom. Where is the bedroom? It is in that corner. Where is she? There. Villagers are getting their daughters married at the age of 16, had they been sent to the Olympics they would get gold medals for our country. This will not work out. You guys are so naive. Your madness. How come these both came inside the house? Bobby, what do I do with you? Hey! Get up and lie down on the bed Where are they? We don't have much time. The villagers will wake up anytime now. It's do or die for us. Mask up your faces. What about me? Dig up tunnels. Tell me, sir. Narasimha, listen to me carefully. The three men that you arrested earlier were actually murderers. They are in fact a gang of four, there is a girl with them. What are you saying, sir? They are right now in your village. I doubt that they are about to attack you. Why would they attack me? Why did they come to your house with a concocted story? Why did they try to take you to Kakinada? After being arrested for robbery, they escaped from us citing another cooked up story that they are students and are here for alcohol. After all this, they still entered your village. Why? When you join all the dots, I get a feeling that they have targeted you. I am getting reinforcement to your house. You should be careful. I will spare none of them. Take off your masks. Move. Kneel down. Kneel down. Why are you here? Tell me. Why are you here? Tell me. -We don't know anything, sir. Speak up. -We don't know anything, sir. Why did you lie to me that Srinu had an accident? -We don't know anything, sir. We don't know anything, sir. We came for the alcohol, sir. We don't know anything, sir. -Why did you plan to take me to Kakinada all alone? We didn't plan anything, sir. We didn't plan anything. I'll kill you all if you won't tell the truth. Siddhu, let us tell the truth. Bro, please don't. Speak up. Siddhu, please let's tell the truth. -Please don't. I can't bear this. Please let's tell him. -Please, bro. Don't do that. Narasimha, you may step aside. I will take care of them. Sir, we don't know anything, sir. Sir. Sir. Rascal. Backstabbers. I fed you biryani and gifted you alcohol yet you backstabbed me! How dare you backstab me! You thrashed the police and saved your gang member who killed her own child and husband. Why did you do that? -We don't know anything, sir. Tell me the truth. Tell me the truth. Tell me the truth. Tell me the truth. Tell me the truth. Tell me the truth. -Tell me the truth. We didn't know that those men were police. We thought we saved her from goons. But later we got to know that we have hit policemen who were in mufti. We thought we might get into trouble, so we planned to catch that girl and hand her over to you. That was our only way to salvation. We chased her but she escaped our clutches and entered this house. We thought it was her when we attacked, we didn't know it was the SI. Yes, sir. -This is the whole truth, sir. If you are telling the truth, the girl must be inside this house. Yes, sir. Head… -Search the whole house. Come. Quick. Lakshmi, search this room. Lokesh, search that room. Sir, we found the girl. Lakshmi, try to wake her up. Girl, get up. Dear Swati! Talk to me, child. Why did you get me married to him? Why did you ruin my life? I need to take his permission to go to the market. I need his permission to continue my studies. I need his permission to talk to you as well. What lousy life is this? I am not his wife, I'm a slave to him. He doesn't love me, he owns me. He doesn't care about my likes or dislikes. He just wants my body. He is an animal with no emotions. A man's married life requires only a woman but a woman's married life needs love in it. If there is a delay in opening the door, he questions me "what were you doing inside?". He doubts his own child and every other man in the village. One night, he came home all sloshed and banged my six-month-old child on the ground. She died. He killed my child. That's why I killed that scoundrel. My life would have been very peaceful had he just shown a tenth of the love that you have for me. God made both man and woman equal. But these men have forgotten that women have as many desires as they have. Lord Shiva made his spouse the other half of his body and Lord Vishnu gave his spouse a place in his heart, and Lord Brahma carried her spouse on his tongue, to tell us that men and women are equal. But these men are assaulting the other of their species who are responsible for their whole existence. Don't cry, child. Don't cry. I'll file the case as homicide for self-defence. She will come back soon. Constables. How long does it take to open the door? -I had milk boiling on the cooktop. Sleep. We can talk about it tomorrow. Why are you at the temple at this time? Devika. Shall we have a coffee? Sorry. For what? For being a moron all this while. Our mindset is stuck in the medieval era. We take our wives for granted. I was one among those men, I made many mistakes. Yet you have been loyal to me. Thanks. I was afraid to tell you. I have completed my M. Sc. That's okay. I want to do a job. Your wish. I have been speaking to my parents behind your back. It was my to restrict you from doing anything. Sorry. You cross-check each statement of mine. Do you remember? I hate it. I made many mistakes. When the mistakes are on your side, is it fair to expect loyalty from me? I have realized my mistakes. Let's start our life again. How did you get out, dude? I don't know, dude. I fell from a height. When I woke up, I found myself in a tunnel. I walked for a long distance then I found stairs. Stairs? I climbed up and knocked on the door. There one lady opened the door. -My husband is not in the house. Come in. Leave me. -Stop. Come with me. It's okay, come. Stop laughing. We would have killed you, had you gone with her. Idiot. - Stop it, man. - Idiot. Some mistakes in our lives make our lives better. You are one such mistake. I believe that my husband will be a better person from now onwards. I have begun a new life. I owe it to you. Thank you so much. Don't try to contact me again. All the best. You are not as stupid as I thought. Thank God. Don't get overexcited. You are good for being a friend but you can't be my lover. I have a lot of expectations. What are they? He must be working in the US. He must be handsome, and… Hello, hello. Stop your nonsense! You must refrain from marrying a sadist who will ask you to take his permission for everything including going to market, shopping or even visiting your parents. You must choose a boy who can keep you as happy as you are with your father. Got it? Siddhu! Siddhu! Sir. They are the boys that I had told you about. You must have taught them lessons from the syllabus. I will teach them life lessons. Good morning, sir. -Good morning. Let's start Viva with Harsha. First question. When will Prabhas get married? How will we know that? Ask Mr. Krishnam Raju about it. Okay. When will Rajamouli's next cinema release? Even he doesn't know that. Good one. Okay, now the last and final question. What is the land price in Orissa? Hello, sir. Are you listening to yourself while speaking? Don't act over smart. Don't imitate my mannerism. Shut up. Sir, you are asking all irrelevant questions. You have wrong-footed the Principal's daughter. This is the side effect of that. Okay. Stop wailing. Let me ask you engineering questions. Let me see how knowledgeable you are. What is your project? JP Morgan financial service project, sir. Where did you buy that? -In Ameerpet, sir. How much did he charge you? -Rs. 5000, sir. It used to be just Rs. 2000. Inflation has gone up, sir. The country is eagerly awaiting for engineers like you. Obviously, sir. So have we passed our project evaluation? Shut up. How can I pass you? You won't come to college, won't study the subjects and in the end but the projects from the black market. I'll shove this up. He was kidding, sir. We made the project. You can ask any question regarding that. We are ready to answer it. If I let you have your degree, the whole software industry will be ruined. I know what I should do with you… I'll reject you all. -Jai Balayya! Jai Balayya! Jai Balayya! Jai Balayya! -Are you a fan of Balayya? Are you as well? I am a fan of Pawan Kalyan. -That means our project will be trashed. Why will it be trashed? You are a fan of Balayya and I am a fan of Pawan Kalyan. Basically, we are fans of cinema. Super, sir. So will you pass us? Jai Powerstar? Jai Balayya!
