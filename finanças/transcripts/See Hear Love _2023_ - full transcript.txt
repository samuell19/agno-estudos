The wind is blowing. What can you see right now? I can't see anything, but I can see you. Are you pulling an all-nighter again? Tomorrow's my deadline. Since you won't pull an all-nighter, I have to. You need to prepare since you're seeing Ogre-yama tomorrow. Please get some rest. You're right. Just imagining what that ogre might say... If you keep having energy drinks while sitting in a chair all night, you're gonna get a belly real fast. Nakamura, you should get some rest. I'll do the all-nighter instead. Oh, This week's finishes were good. I was stunned by the last panel. Of course. Whose apprentice do you think I am? Good work. Don't stay up too late! WHEN IT HURTS, JUST SMILE SUPERVISOR HIBIKI AIDA MISUZU ACADEMY "Get home safe." Good morning. Are you well? How come you don't come to speech training lately? If you work on vocalizing, I'm sure you'll get better. "I don't want to speak when I can't even hear my own voice." Hirayama... Has it been discontinued? Please give me at least another 15... no, ten chapters. If I have that much, I'll be able to wrap it up nicely. No. Izumoto Sensei. Congrats. Hey. Your efforts have finally paid off. ONLY FOR YOU will become a movie. A movie? But on one condition. The ending of this plot... It's too kind. Too kind? Now, what should we do... Your heroine, Sumire. Kill her off. This is how emotions burst. Let's make it sensational, okay? That's how you bring out the tears from the audience. Enough tears to fill their collarbones. Here's a special bonus. I'll give you five more after the movie. You'll do it, right? There. SHINJI IZUMOTO THANKS TO ALL YOUR SUPPORT... THERE WILL BE A LIVE-ACTION MOVIE! SHINJI IZUMOTO MESSAGE READING SUMIRE'S STORY GAVE ME THE COURAGE TO DO MY BEST AND TO FIND MY WAY EVEN IN THE TOUGHEST OF TIMES Shinji Izumoto's original story! ONLY FOR YOU finally becomes a comic book! A good story is based on its ending. If the ending changes, the story could be destroyed. Don't worry. I'll make you into a star manga artist. Now you've joined the major league. Sumire... I have to kill Sumire off. That's the condition for the movie. What did you just say? Are you insane? I have to fill people's collarbones with tears. Well, it's not like this is the last manga of my life. I could spread my name a bit and then make my masterpiece next. Sensei... what about the readers? Tae, good evening. What are you two doing again? The bed is in the other room. What did you pick up this time? You went again? Don't touch it! They're things I'll use once I'm on my own. Since you two are gonna abandon me once you get married, right? What are you saying... I struggled, working like a dog to raise this kid who had nowhere to go. But now that I can't walk, you're gonna abandon me, huh? What do you mean, abandon... What's the matter? Are you okay? It's nothing. Find a more humane job, where you can live a normal life! That's why I told you to quit being an artist! - He's not an artist, he's a manga artist. - Whatever! Stop fighting. TRÄUMEREI TRÄUMEREI - SCHUMANN PIANO PERFORMANCE TRÄUMEREI Focus. Once... I finish this... What? Male, 32 years old, experiencing impaired consciousness. - Vitals are stable. - Past medical history? - Not sure. - His eyes hurt? - Yes. - Can you hear me? - Doctor, where do we take him? - Room 1! One, two, three! Move the stretcher. GCS E1, V1, M5. Score: 7. - He doesn't seem paralyzed. - I agree. I'm going to shine a light in your eyes. And that's it. Thank you. I believe you have acute angle-closure glaucoma. What was that? Didn't your eyes feel weird? I'm sure it must've been very painful. Um, about that acute something... Acute angle-closure glaucoma. What exactly is... It's where eye pressure rises rapidly and doesn't return to normal. Your condition likely worsened, and you had an acute glaucoma attack. Here. An attack? You had symptoms much earlier, didn't you? Will I recover? My eyes... What'll happen to my eyes? ONLY FOR YOU ON HIATUS Sensei, what happened? You put the series on hiatus without even telling me. Nakamura, you should find a new job now. What happened? You haven't picked up your phone for two weeks. You won't even open up when I come over. I can't see. What? I can't see, so I can't work. What do you mean? Please find another job. Sensei! ONLY FOR YOU ON HIATUS ONLY FOR YOU ON HIATUS Grandma... Grandma, are you okay? Don't come over! Sorry, Grandma! My leg... Were you trying to cook? Nobody asked you to do that. You're joking right now, aren't you? I know you can really see. Stop playing pranks on the elderly. You cold-blooded fool! Grandma... is this water? Or is it blood? It's water! Grandma, this is blood. Call the hospital. Call them now! I can't see. Call them now! Sorry to keep you waiting. Your grandmother's arm injury isn't deep, so you don't have to worry. According to the doctor, her foot injury will need a week in the hospital. Thank you. She's been disabled from the long-term effects of her stroke. The hospital will take care of her. Then I'll be going now. I have a favor to ask. Yes? Could you take me back home? What? Are you visually impaired? Yes. What time is it now? - Is it still nighttime? - What? You mean, you can't see at all? That's right. Don't worry. Everything will be fine. When it hurts, just smile! Oh, this? It's a line from my favorite manga. Since when have you been visually impaired? I'm not exactly sure. Maybe about a month ago... I could no longer tell if it was daytime or nighttime. I can't even work now. What did you do? I used to draw manga. Manga? A manga artist? Oh, what were you drawing? ONLY FOR YOU. Oh, my God! Sensei! Will Mamoru become a pianist? It's such an honor to meet you! Just call me, and I'll do anything to help. You can come visit every day if you'd like. You can have meals together too. I'm sure you won't regret moving here. Don't touch me! Grandma, I'll try to visit you lots. - Take care. - Don't visit me lots! I don't want to see you. I don't need anything, so just leave me alone! Honestly, why are you gonna come when you can't even see anything?! Just forget about me and take care of your own body more! Why did you have to go blind... The door is opening. We're going left now. We're almost there. Ah, Sensei. Please let me. - Thank you. - I'll take that. Opening the door now. There. Oh, thank you. - I can come in. - No, it's okay. Ah, okay. Thank you so much for everything, Mr. Sugawara. Oh, just call me Tetsuya. All right? FOR THE VISUALLY IMPAIRED It's study material for braille. Make sure you go over it, okay? You gotta start with braille. Thank you. Sensei. Fight! Okay, I'm closing the door now. Excuse me. FOR THE VISUALLY IMPAIRED Why me? Why? Why?! Why me?! SHINJI IZUMOTO I READ THIS WEEK'S MANGA TOO! UNREAD WALKING AROUND MY HOUSE FOR INSPIRATION SUNRISE NIPPORI SHINJI IZUMOTO SUNRISE NIPPORI Who is it?! I said, who is it?! Who are you? HELLO. MY NAME IS HIBIKI AIDA. I CAN NEITHER HEAR NOR TALK. THAT IS WHY I WRITE ON PAPER. "I asked who you were." I AM A BIG FAN OF YOUR MANGA. I CAME BECAUSE I WAS WORRIED AFTER YOUR SUDDEN HIATUS. Say something. DID SOMETHING HAPPEN? Hey. Hey! Who was that? Hey. Say something! Answer me! Let go of me! Let go! Let go... Who are you? Say something! A woman? Say something! What are you doing? Are you a thief? I'm going to die! What's your problem... She's asleep? What the hell? Then on the next day and the next day... Hibiki came to my place every day. "When... it... hurts..." WHEN IT HURTS "...just... smile." Why is she doing all this for someone like me? That was how Hibiki pulled me out of the dark. She gave me courage. That was the moment I decided that I can't give up. That I have to live. And that's how I made it this far. Now, I honestly want to live. Much more than when I was able to see. Sensei, I'll do my very, very best to live too. Huh? Thank you. Just as I dreamed, my manga was finally printed. But now I can't even see it. My own work. Isn't life ironic? WHEN HANDLING MONEY, SPECIFY THE TYPE OF BANKNOTE OR COIN ALWAYS PUT THINGS BACK IN THEIR ORIGINAL SPOT! I'LL MAKE OMURICE TODAY Sumire... while crying... walks through... walks through... the street. Meanwhile... Noboru... runs around... all over the place, desperately... searching for... Sumire. She's so young, but never cuts corners. Such a good girl! I almost want her as my son's wife. She can't hear your compliments. She can tell by reading my lips! Fight! Fight! Oh, so cute! Hello! We just opened today. You can have a free cup of coffee, so please come visit! Hello. I'm the owner of the jazz café that opened today. You're Hibiki, right? We're handing out one cup of free coffee per customer. Please come visit, okay? I'll be waiting. Wait. Wait! You really came! Congratulations, Hibiki! You're our first customer! Please come inside. Since you're our first customer, we'll even treat you to dessert! This way, please. Please sit, sit, sit, sit. Just wait a second. "The piano is fantastic." "Can you play?" The piano? Of course I can play! "I'd like to learn. Do you offer lessons?" Of course you can learn. You can learn. For free. Free! For good girls and cute girls, we give special services! "There is a song I want to play." Do... So powerful... Gently. More gently. Gently. Gently... re, mi, fa, so, la, ti... Yes! WHAT DOES THE PIANO SOUND LIKE? It's just like how you imagine. Very beautiful. But... why do you want to learn "Träumerei"? THERE'S SOMEONE I WANT TO PLAY IT FOR. Who is it? SOMEONE I LOVE. Half a year ago, she left a letter saying, "I'm going to live on my own." Hibiki Aida vanished from Misuzu Academy. She was later found working at CERTE Shopping Mall as a custodian. - Sir, are you okay? - Yeah, I'm okay. Thank you. I read the letter. HIBIKI AIDA I negotiated with the jazz café that just opened in the building, and I made contact with her. Why did she leave the comfortable children's home to work in that building? I also unintentionally ended up becoming her piano teacher. The song Hibiki wants to play is "Träumerei." I've been practicing "Träumerei" without any sleep now too. Wasn't I the CEO's secretary? What's "Träumerei"? "Träumerei," by Robert Schumann. Apparently, she wants to play it for someone she loves. Someone she loves? What? M... M... Me? Shinji Izumoto. Occupation: manga artist. He's currently living with Hibiki. A marriage certificate hasn't been submitted, so they're not legally married. - Continue. - What's important is that Izumoto is visually impaired and cannot see. He can't? A Deaf woman and a blind man are living together. In a state of difficulty. Why on earth? Why don't you investigate it yourself as CEO? Your outfit is cute. Sir, you can't see into the car through these windows. TRÄUMEREI So pretty! Hibiki! Look! You're so pretty! Why don't you try modeling? A model for cosmetics! They're having an open audition right now. You should try! Just one audition. Yeah? Because you're so pretty. I AM DEAF. MORE IMPORTANTLY... PIANO. Yeah, we'll keep practicing the piano. But let's also try the modeling! One, two, three, four, five, six, seven... One, two, three, four... One, two, three. What do you see? Construction. Buildings. Traffic light. Is the sun still out? You should be able to see the stars soon. What is your dream, Hibiki? My dream is to become a happy bride. What is your dream? To fulfill that dream of yours. Straighten your back and face forward. Does it hurt? It does. Left, right... left... Grandma, your grandson's here to see you. What does he want now? Why does he come so often when I tell him not to? Going in... Here we are. What's this? Who's this girl? Let me introduce you. Your new girlfriend? NICE TO MEET YOU. MY NAME IS HIBIKI AIDA. I LIVE WITH SHINJI. I'M SORRY FOR NOT INTRODUCING MYSELF SOONER. I CANNOT HEAR OR SPEAK. I'M SORRY FOR MY FLAWS. BUT I'M HAPPY TO BE ABLE TO MEET YOU TODAY. I PROMISE TO CHERISH SHINJI AND WOULD LIKE YOUR BLESSING FOR OUR RELATIONSHIP. What's this? She can't hear? Yeah. She's the greatest girl in the world. Gosh... He can't see, she can't hear, and I'm in a wheelchair. Life can't get any better than this. Take me outside. I told you to take me outside! Stand up. Gosh, what do you two want from me? Grandma, Hibiki is the greatest girl I know. We've been doing fine up to now, and we can continue that way. You're crying already, when life's only going to get harder. How are you gonna survive when you're that soft? What's crying gonna do? I'm sorry to bother you when you're busy. Sensei, don't worry about it. I got off work already. By the way, Tetsuya, have you ever given a Christmas gift to a woman? Oh, it's almost Christmas. Do you know this story, Sensei? There's a young but poor married couple. The wife cuts and then sells her long hair that she's really proud of. And with that money, she buys a chain for her husband's precious pocket watch. But the husband sold the watch to buy her combs. Yeah! "The Gift of the Magi,"O. Henry's short story. When I read it, I couldn't stop crying. Enough to fill your collarbones with tears? Not as much as ONLY FOR YOU. Her precious hair and his precious watch... I suppose giving a gift means wanting to give something that is the most precious to you. Yes. Sensei. We're here. Once you're done, please take a taxi home. Thank you. Around here is fine. Sensei, please don't give up as a manga artist. It's not over for you. Well, I'll be going now. Be safe. Thank you. What do you think? Yes... This ring shines beautifully. Is it really beautiful? I mean, it feels nice. Yes. Did you know? Diamonds symbolize eternal love. I actually... have never bought a ring before. How much is your budget? Thank you very much. Please come again. It's dangerous that way! Be careful. Are you okay? I'll be okay because I have this cane. Thank you. No... No need to thank me. Whenever I see someone in an unfortunate situation, I just can't turn a blind eye. I'll help you with anything. I mean, w-would you like some help? I'd like to get a taxi. T-Taxi? P-Please hold on. A t-taxi is here now. Let's get on. Thank you. You didn't have to do this much for me. This taxi is really comfortable. S... S... S... Seems like it's a new luxury-type taxi. By the way, what's your name? Daisu... No. D-Daisaku. Daisaku Uematsu. Uematsu. Yes. Thank you. Please take the taxi bill from here. No, please. Don't. I can't take money from someone in trouble. I'm not disabled. Which way is it? That way. Thank you for everything today. Not at all. Mr. Izumoto. Since we're here, how about a cup of tea? To tell you the truth, I support a disabled children's home and have helped many people in unfortunate situations. It's a tough world, so we need to help each other out. Isn't that right? Just because you wear high-end leather shoes and a silk suit with pricey cologne doesn't mean you're a big shot in the world. Please stop. Even if I can't see, I can see everything. What? We appreciate you helping the handicapped, but please don't look down on us with pity. I may be visually impaired, but I am not an unfortunate person. If this is all for self-satisfaction, please stop. H-Hey! That's no way to talk to someone! Th-That's rude! You gonna ignore me when I'm talking? What a despicable guy. S... S-So this is how you repay me? Please leave. Aren't you glad you listened to me? You should see the readers' reactions. The movie deal is going well too. Filming will begin by the end of the year. Now you've joined the star manga artists. Right?! Whose idea was it to make Sumire catch an incurable disease? Me. Great! Now let's add my car-accident idea too. It'll double the tragedy. An incurable disease, then a car accident. Bam! That's a bit much. Huh? What? No? Why not? That's like forcing people to cry. I think it's too much. It's just simply melodramatic. Anyway, can we discuss the printed manga's payment that we spoke about? You know, we went all over the place and spent a ton on advertising and business fees to promote you. We're here eating Cup Noodles every day, but you can't even thank us, let alone add in one car accident. So? What? The car accident. Will you add it in? Or won't you? - Fine. - Yes! Fantastic! You'll be a major manga artist in no time! Here you go. Now, now... They're called the tears of God. It means they will never break no matter what. I highly recommend it. Here. Thank you. Thank you. I'm home. SUMIRE HAS LEUKEMIA What is it? Why does Sumire suddenly have an incurable disease? It couldn't be helped, story-wise. I don't want an ending like this! This is not like your story! What's wrong? It's just a manga. Do you know how many people were given hope by your manga? Please don't lie to yourself. I don't want to do this either. If I could change it, I would. I want to freely draw my manga too. But we have to make a living, so there's no choice. We're not the same as everybody else. Reality or ideals? We gotta survive before we dream. I can't see, so it can't be helped. CORNEAL TRANSPLANT 50,000 USD GRAND PRIZE 10 MILLION YEN You want to? I'm so glad! You saved me. Thank you! You saved me! Thank you! It'll be fine. I'm sure you'll win! I'll be with you. Okay? Let's do this! Hello. Please face forward. You're really like a princess. This is a guaranteed win! Number 1750. Hibiki Aida on set! Hello, Miss Hibiki. Nice to meet you. This way, please. - Please watch your step. - Be careful. Sorry. NO! PLEASE DON'T DIE! Ms. Nakamura... I don't think this will work. This flow is just not right. The heroine with an incurable disease getting into a car accident. You're saying this now? - You know the deadline's tomorrow. - I should've never listened to Hirayama. Don't waste time on those kinds of thoughts, and let's just finish this. This isn't ONLY FOR YOU. You know, today's a special day. We must dress nice when signing the contract. RETURN LIGHT TO YOUR EYES WITH A CORNEAL TRANSPLANT - Hello. - Hello. What kind of business do you have today? A meeting with the CEO. Your name? Hibiki Aida. Please have a seat there. Excuse me. I'd like to congratulate you on winning our Christmas season model contest. You are just what the CEO wanted. Sir, please sit down. Right now. Now. Now is your chance. Now... You don't need to interpret that. Just as you read here, we can begin our talks once you sign here. Hibiki is signing the document, so please sit down and do the same. Get over here now! Now! Okay... Come here and say something. Just say something. Anything will do. Now. Now, speak. Just speak already... Speak. Either speak or sign the document. Quickly. Please say something. We won't get this chance again. Now is your time. Speak. Speak. H-Hibiki! M-Marry me! DAISUKE UEMURA She's asking, "What is this? Have you been lying to me?" What? Me? What... Why would she think that? I may not be able to hear, but I can hear and understand everything. So it was all a lie. No, not everything! Did you choose me intentionally? No, it's not like that! You two know each other, right? Yes, we do. But... So this was all a trick? No, it wasn't a trick! I didn't trick you! Please, wait. Yes, I am employed here. But you were meant to be chosen. Wait, wait... Please listen. Let's be calm about this. Look. Right now, you are at a crossroads in life. This was all for you. How long are you going to live your life for Izumoto? Why do you dedicate yourself so much to him? Hibiki, this is your life! This is for your life! "Copyright Transfer Agreement"? To receive the funds, it seems like we need you to transfer the rights. Here. Please sign here. You mean to give up my rights? No, no. Not "give up." You sell it. Sensei, it's ten million yen... - Thank you very much. - No, not at all. Rather, why don't you strip me down to the bone? Would you like me to sell my soul too? Izumoto, what's the matter? I have no intention of selling my work. Hey, listen up. With all this money, you can have a wedding and pay for your grandma's home. You'll be set for life! Alright? You were wishing so hard for your dreams to come true. You're gonna give up now? I won't give up until the very end. There's no point in that money. And that ending you wanted for my story will not happen either. I will never give up on my own story until the very end. I will make it a piece that gives people hope and tells them love can overcome anything. Sumire will not die. Even if I'm blind, I will never sell you my soul, no matter how much you offer me. Hey! Wait... You bastard. This is how you repay me? I can see clearly now. Your shrewd, true nature. Excuse me. I'll make sure you can never work in this industry! So what's the ending going to be like? I told you, Sumire isn't going to die. I won't cause you trouble, so don't worry. Things aren't that simple. Nakamura, listen carefully. I'm finally able to see myself properly, to be able to see the truth. Besides... to the fans, to you and Tetsuya, and to me and Hibiki, this piece is a beacon of hope. I can't let it go to waste. Hibiki once said to me... to not lie to myself. Hibiki... Hibiki... I'm glad you're okay. Who are you? I'm Dai... Daisaku Uematsu. I helped you into a taxi not long ago. You just suddenly collapsed. It really gave me a shock. How are you feeling? I'm okay. Of course you're not okay! It's a miracle you made it here alive. A miracle! Are you with him? Doctor. Please tell me what's happening. I'll be fine. Look here. A tumor was found in your brain. Right here. You know what that is? A malignant tumor. The cause of your blindness wasn't glaucoma. It was this tumor! Right here! The symptoms are the same, but the cause was wrong. Your tumor is located in the suprasellar region, and even I can't do this surgery. I heard there's an experienced doctor for this operation in the U.S. or India... Could you help me leave the hospital? What? A-Are you really going to believe what that man said? I can tell just by his voice. He was telling nothing but the truth. You aren't going to eat? I'm not hungry. You don't eat. That's why your eyes get bad. Grandma, please promise to get better. If you work on rehab, you can walk. What's this during lunch? Who cares if I live or die? Just worry about yourselves. Tetsuya... Yes? Thank you so much for everything. Though I didn't have any hair to cut and I was unable to buy a pocket watch chain. Sensei, what's the matter all of a sudden? Your comic has changed my life, Sensei! I haven't paid you back enough yet. "When it hurts, just smile!" HOW TO COOK MEALS MORE DELICIOUSLY Thank you. Your cooking is really delicious. It's delicious. Hibiki. Sorry. I love you. Goodbye. CORNEAL TRANSPLANT CLEAN FREQUENTLY! DON'T PUT DRINKS ON THE EDGE OF THE TABLE Even if I cannot see or hear you, I can now see and hear you wherever I am. I love you forever... my Hibiki. I'm sorry I couldn't fulfill your dream. By Shinji Izumoto. Sensei! What happened? Why are you here? Are you alone? Nakamura, would you let me stay here for a bit? I want you to help me finish. I want to finish my series. I want to draw. Have you eaten yet? - I'll cook. - Nakamura, it's fine. Let's draw first. We don't have time. THIS IS HIBIKI AIDA. SHINJI IS GONE. DO YOU KNOW WHERE HE IS? Hibiki... I'm really sorry. I couldn't get a hold of you for a week, so I got worried and came over. You must be angry. Hibiki... YOU HAVE TO LIVE, SIS... YOU HAVE TO LIVE, SIS... Nakamura? I will help you. WHERE ARE YOU? I MISS YOU Good evening. THE CEO OF KALEIDO WOULD LIKE TO TALK. LET'S GO TOGETHER. Hibiki, come here. P-Please... sit here. Don't give up until the very end. When it hurts, just smile. I love you. So this is your gift to Hibiki. All of it. Saori. For everything that you've done for me... thank you so much. Do you remember? When we met at the children's home that my... dad supported? "Daisuke Uemura." "What do you want from me?" Interpreter. Interpreter! Do you... remember this? When you were nine. Everyone would laugh when I tried to speak. But you... never laughed. Instead... you gave me this box of candy. The moment you gave me this, I... I decided... I decided... that I would marry you, Hibiki. Snow... It's snowing, right? A little bit. I think it'll snow more soon. I'll be going now if you're done talking. No matter what... there is nothing you can do to pull us apart. I'm going to look for him forever. I will never give up. Th-There's no point! He's gonna die soon. What did you say? The doctor said there was nothing that could be done. That's why you have to accept it. Yes? Ah, yes. I'll hurry. Where is he right now? Tell me! Tell me. Where is he? Anabuki Mansion. Room 303, with Nakamura. Saori Nakamura. SAORI NAKAMURA THE LAST CHAPTER OF ONLY FOR YOU THESE ARE HIS LAST WORDS FOR YOU ONLY FOR YOU ENDING YOU HAVE TO LIVE, SIS... But a happy ending still exists. I'd like to borrow my friend Rainer Maria Rilke's words. "Put out my eyes, but I still can see you. Close my ears, but I still can hear you. And without feet, I still can follow you. And without voice, I still can call for you. Break off my arms, but I still can hold you. Grasp you with my heart as with a hand. Arrest my heart, but my brain shall still beat. And if you ignite this brain of mine, then I will carry you within my blood." Dearest Sumire, don't give up until the very end. When it hurts, just smile. I love you. WHERE IS SHINJI? He left. He's not here anymore. He left because it was snowing. He said he won't be back. I couldn't stop him. Why? It's because I don't have that right. This... Sensei asked me to throw it away. But I know... that this was meant for you, Hibiki. SHINJI IS NOT WITH NAKAMURA HELP Izumoto has disappeared. Why won't you say anything? Don't tell me you actually think you can be happy by making others miserable. Should I die instead? What do you mean, "die"? After you stirred up all this trouble? Even if it's late, let's deliver Hibiki's voice to Izumoto. Okay? Before he dies, we must do all that we can. Got it?! I'll pay however much it costs. Play her message on any media you can get your hands on. KALEIDO HAS MADE A NEW POST PIANO PERFORMANCE BY KALEIDO'S NEW MODEL Hello, everyone. The woman here is Deaf, and she would like to give a special performance for her loved one. KALEIDO's Special Christmas Event starts now. Izumoto, please listen! This is Hibiki Aida's performance. ONLY FOR YOU's theme song. Why didn't you tell me sooner? I could've looked for him much earlier! Please help us. We might not have much time left! What? Please help me find him. If I could just send my voice... so that he can sense I'm with him wherever he is. Damn it. Sensei! Where are you? I told you not to give up! So that he can find me... even if he can't see. There's still so much I want to do for him. PIANO PERFORMANCE BY KALEIDO'S NEW MODEL And lastly, there is one more gift prepared by Hibiki. Shinji... I... love... you. Merry Christmas! Shinji... Shinji... Hibiki... I... I love you. ...love... you. But a happy ending still exists. Pocket watch chain... Hair... Even if I can't see, I can see everything. Even if I can't hear, I can hear everything. When it hurts, just smile. But a happy ending still exists. Took you a while. Welcome home. Let me hear it too. Your "Träumerei." The groom, Shinji Izumoto. Do you take this woman, Hibiki Aida... to be your wife in sickness and in health, for richer, for poorer... and till parted by death... to love... and to honor... and... to cherish her? I do. The bride... Love is to share your most precious things with each other, isn't it? Congratulations, sir. You've grown from an unrequited love devil into Santa Claus. ...for richer... for poorer... and till parted by death to love and to honor... and to cherish him? Now you may kiss.
