When he was 10 years old, he saw his stepfather kill his own mother. Stepfather assassinates biological mother He entered the orphanage with his brother who was 2 years younger. After that, he has been tossing around in orphanages and relatives' homes. At 24 years old, he was working in a bakery factory He had Ruptured eardrums due to severe violence and bullying by seniors. What's wrong? Does it hurt? With nowhere to go, he endured the bullying at the time. But four years later, he stabbed his senior with a kitchen knife. The reason for the assassination was because he heard his senior insulting him... "What's the point of living for someone like you, just be killed like your mother." Compared to other crimes, the murder recidivism rate is relatively low. Most of the crimes are committed out of a momentary impulse of anger and dissatisfaction. Kudo must be like that too.

To keep it from dripping down and becoming rough. If you don't do it all carefully, the metallic luster can't come out. Therefore, it must be carefully sprayed with a spray gun, at a distance of 20 cm. It's a bit expensive, but it's a reward. Hello, this is Agawa. About the day after tomorrow periodic report.

Forget about all those ex-convicts. Go and live your own life. Midori-san. The word reform... It means they're born again. To be reborn as a human being once again. To be able to accompany them to be reborn, Isn't that an awesome thing? Even if the ex-convict is reborn. He probably can only become a zombie. Go ahead. Are you finally awake? This time, You should have walked before the gate of hell. Anyway, it's for the best. Please answer my question. He was the one who took the gun from you. Do you have any clue? No. Is there anyone who might hate you? No. Hey you listen... You know you've been watched by the Inspector, right? You are now the focus of attention. You use your position as a police officer to threaten and intimidate. Punching, kicking, and harass your juniors. So there is a lot of resentment, right? Hey, what are you doing? Hey. Really?

The victim was Yasuko Tanabe, a 57-year-old employee of the Ward Office, Welfare Division. After attending the junior's wedding... she was looking for a restaurant for a second meeting. and suffered this incident. I heard that the shot was fired without hesitation. Suzuki Takimoto set off directly to the scene. Is there anything you would like to pray for? Ah... no. That's right... If praying to God works. Then anyone can be happy. That's what I thought after I became the probation officer. There are many people who commit crimes. They have had many problems since childhood. Both sad and painful. I gave up a lot of things to grow up. If there is a God, Then He should save them. Even if God does exist... That's a cruel, bad-hearted God. Here. I am sorry. I Always make beef and rice. It must be boring, right? No. I like your beef rice. That's right. After the end of your probation observation. How about we are going to dinner together to celebrate? Kudo-san, what is your favorite food? Ramen. It looks so delicious! The ramen there is very good. I used to eat there with my mother and brother. Well, it seems to be the taste in your memory. I would like to try it too. Then let's celebrate there. Alright. Agawa sensei, why did you became a probation officer? It's a long story. I've been through a lot too. I want to hear it... Your long story. Is that so? Well, let's wait for the right time. Please tell me about it when the time comes. Alright. Next time is your last periodic report. Two weeks left in parole observation period. Kudo-san... Just a little bit more. Yes. Section Chief Yasuko Tanabe Ah, excuse me. We have checked a lot of records. Tanabe-san really doesn't hold a grudge against people. It's seem that Tanabe has a good reputation. We all respect her work. She always takes the lead. Working with isolating and protecting victims of domestic violence... Will it lead to resentment from the aggressor? We will cooperate with the police to deal with that kind of situation. The only thing is that Tanabe's did was... Do her best to appease the party identified as the perpetrator. Doesn't it really get tiring to help others year after year? We are also human beings. But when it comes to Tanabe, it's a different story. She really is like a saint. "Saints" Did you find any clues about the victim's resentment? No, it look like she was a great person. It's not the time for admiration. She was shot with the police gun. Right. The Search Headquarters received a document from an unknown sender. It was delivered from the Shimomaruko East Post Office. Go check that out. Okay. Sending heavenly punishment on hypocrites. Yasuko Tanabe is not a saint. Instead, she's a demon with a mask. That's an interesting letter. Yes. Thanks for your hard work. You've worked hard too. The new product called "thick back fat assorted flavor." Want to try it? Can I? You have to fill out the questionnaire. With pleasured. How is it? It's bad isn't it? But I'm hungry, and I can totally eat it. We can't sell it then. The world is also going to end. A person who worked for the people welfare, was suddenly shot. Serial shootings and killings "Helping people is the meaning of life" The second victim was an employee of the Welfare Division, a partner of the weak. The hooded men who escaped were between the ages of 20 and 40 His whereabouts is still unknown. The gun he uses, It is the gun that was taken in the attack on the civilian police last month. This model can be loaded with five rounds. There may still be three rounds remaining. Police Department urge the public... to provide information regarding the suspect, for the arrest of criminals... We're here. What are we going to do here? Minoru. Who are you? Don't you remember me? What's wrong? Nii-chan (Big Brother) Don't go, nii-chan. Don't go anywhere, nii-chan... Don't go! Let's go see a doctor, Minoru. Taking this kind of medicine isn't good. But if I don't take it, I can't live. Where did you get this? Don't you know that I need it? Don't look down at me like that. I don't want to be like Tetsu-kun. Help me. Tetsu-kun you're talking about... is it Tetsu-kun that being bullied? Nii-chan, when you left home. Tetsu-kun was also fostered to someone else's home. I was bullied after that. I became Tetsu-kun replacement. Because I'm stupid and weak, there is no one lower than me. Even when I go to work, I have always been at the bottom of pile. The salary is also very small. No one takes me seriously. So don't look down at me like that. Please. I'm going to be alone again. - Nii-chan. - You will be alright. It's alright. Nii-chan. Let's go for a walk, nii-chan. Nii-chan. What is it? I was happy to see you. Me too. Sensei. What are you doing? I did what had to be done. Let's go to the police station. Turn yourself in. No, I will be sentenced to death. Give me the gun. The gun. Give me the gun! Do you remember? This is the police who didn't help mom. This is the person who promised to help mom. Did you kill them? This is the master from the orphanage. There are still bullets left If you don't kill them, anything won't change. Because I also want to become like my brother. No, no no... No way! Let's do it together. He's been dead for about seven to eight hours. There should be some resistance before he gets shot. - Good work. - Good work. How's it going? The victim was Kentaro Asai, a 51-year-old orphanage employee. Divorced his wife five years ago for gambling. Living alone in an apartment near the river. It was reported by a neighborhood resident who came out to walk his dog. He witnessed a man leaving. The number you are calling is out of service. Hello, this is Agawa. President Nakasaki Kudo-san hasn't come yet. As for us. We have to go to court to apply for transfer letters. Revocation of Makoto Kudo's parole, and arrest him. He should be arrested and put in jail. I want to continue looking for Kudo-san. There is nothing more we can do. I'm short of staff... So I'm making my stage debut. How do I look? Looks good. I'll borrow some books. I'll Kill you! Kill you! Is this some kind of secret spell? I'm not lend you this one. It's my secret item. Why? Not this one. I also have a private matters that I don't want someone else to interfere. Someone else? Can I borrow it, if I am a friend? I'm sorry. Is the book interesting? Yes. Hey. Who is this cute kid? Dad. Hello. Come to our house for dinner if you want. I'll make fried rice for you, it's delicious. Bye. I'll kill you, kill you, kill you, why are you alive? I'm really sorry. Former Child Welfare Physician Hirayama Satoru Aah, isn't this Asai-san, I remember him. He often beats children. And make the kids take medicine, if something happens. What does "something happened" mean? What does "something happened" mean? Oh. When I was still work in the office, the management of the orphanage was very strict. Whether it's eating, bathing or sleeping, there is a fixed time. Even talking is not allowed during meals. Similar to military. After all, many children are disobedient. Children who are abused by their parents, they still have some mental problems. So they are medicated to keep them quiet for a while. Once you take the medicine, you'll be obedient. It can't be helped, right? You are a physician right? Why are you prescribing psychiatric drugs? It was like that all over Japan, at the time. There is no division of psychiatry and cardiology as it is now. The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare at that time also allowed it. The drug company, also give instructions to use that drug. It can't be helped. What happened to Asai-san? He was killed. Now the police are hunting for the culprit. Eeh, is that so? It can't be helped, right? Yes. Suspect identified. Consistent with DNA from residues in the victim's fingernails. Makoto Kudo 35 years old. He's currently on parole, when he was 10, he stayed in the orphanage where Asai worked. This connects the dots. Find Kudo's Probation officer for information? Okay. We are now going there. Welcome. Welcome. It's been a long time. Takimoto-kun. Shinji-kun. We were in the same class together. Well, what a coincidence! We are looking for Makoto Kudo. Why? He is a suspect in an attempted double homicide. I hope you can tell me all about him. Agawa-san is a very enthusiastic conservationist, right? Do you know where Kudo is going? It's must be a mistake. There's no mistake. DNA from the three victims, that we tested in previous murders, consistent with Kudo's DNA. Did he contact you after he disappeared? I'm sorry. I don't care what you ask, Shinji, I won't answer. Kudo was robbing a gun from a police, and has killed at least two people with it. It is very likely that he will kill again. Think about it. Can't you see the clues? The Probation Division doesn't know anything. I don't know anything about the real Kudo. What's wrong with you, Agawa? Are you angry? Let's go. You despise me. You're laughing at me, aren't you? You despise me. Hey... You still like reading so much! Do you live here alone? After that incident. I moved here with my father. I've lived here ever since. I'm alone now. Is that so? I never thought I'd meet you again as the probation officer. Do you have a medicine cabinet? There were many flowers at the scene of my father's murder. But the flowers smell bad when they wither. Neighbors began to complain. Do you know who handles those flowers? The victim's family. Flower petals stick to the asphalt. Can't get rid of it with a brush. How miserable. The murderer lived a normal life after he got out of prison. People always make mistakes. I want to stop it from happening.. Agawa... Murderers are not human. Will Makoto Kudo kill someone again? Didn't it will create pain for the victim's family again? If Kudo contacts you, let me know. I have to catch him. Send heavenly punishment on hypocrites Yasuko Tanabe is not a saint She is a demon wearing a mask. Why are you writing this letter? It's related to a case from 25 years ago, isn't it? Because of your faults, Yukie Toyama, a consultant, was killed by her husband in front of her children. It's not me. It was Tanabe Yasuko who forgot to tell the child allowance section. The employee who did not know about the change of residence called her husband It is written in the trial record that you forgot to convey it. I told you it wasn't me. All because Tanabe begged me to take the blame. Then why did you accept her request? And what good does that do you? Because I was not part of the staff. Tanabe said he could help move my position. So, have you been transferred yet? I blame it on the that hypocrite.. When Yukie-san came to report the case. Did she bring her children? She came with two boys, both very clinging to his mother. Was it him? Looks somewhat like him. I want to have a drink with Agawa sensei. How about 10 year old soju? I'm sorry. Probation officer can not drink with the probation subject. Aah, Is that so? Well, forget it then. One cup is fine. Let's drink it together. Is it okay? Just one cup. You look like Idiot... 1 2 3 4 Look like an idiot. You look like an idiot. Idiot. Idiot... I'll Kill you! Kill you! To the not-so-happy Agawa-san I hope you don't catch a cold. Tamura Thank you. The place where Makoto Kudo used to work Urasawa Bread Factory Yamazaki. Yes. A moment. Kudo's Former colleagues Kazuo Yamazaki So it's about Kudo eh? I haven't said much before. Just tell me anything you know. He often bullied when he was alone. The incident was happened, because his mother was being mocked. He was so angry that his body trembled. After calming down, then he instantly killed the senior. Instantly? He grabbed a nearby knife and stabbed him right there. Without expression. However, after he saw his senior blood flowing on the floor. He suddenly threw the knife away. Then he start screaming. What was Kudo shouting at that time? Mom, I'm sorry for not being able to protect you. Something like that. It wasn't easy to control him until the police arrived. 25 years ago, before she was murdered, Yukie Toyama-san went to the police office to report her abusive husband. She asked the police for help, but no one listened. These are kept in government records in detail. Your junior has confessed. You withheld the report that should have been sent to the police department. What do you guys want? You're not cooperating with the investigation, are you? What are you doing? What are you... The Suspect kills two person with the gun he took from you. Is it all a coincidence? While I was talking with the wife who was murdered. Suddenly I received a phone call from an acquaintance. She said the couple would talk to each other when the wife came home. Who is this acquaintance? The lady in the bar I often go to. Huh? So it's just because you want to see the lady? You send the woman who came to report, back to her domestic abuser husband? If you perform your duty. That lady doesn't have to die, you bastard. Look... That's security. Our stepfather killed our mother, and lived well. He's so skinny. Our mother is dead and he can still laughs. It's exactly 120 yen, no change. Thank you very much. Hello. Where are you now? Sorry for your trouble, Agawa-sensei What's going on? As expected... I can't go back. What are you talking about? Please explain to me properly. I'll be done with this soon. Aah... I... I want to eat ramen with you. I will wait for you at that ramen store. So please come. Meet me in 1 hour at 9:00. Please, you have to come. It's all right, go ahead. What's going on? It's been 2 hours. I didn't see anyone. You must eat a bowl of ramen, after drinking. Super delicious. - Welcome. - Three ramen sets. Okay. Please wait a moment. There are no more seats available. - There's room here. - Please don't do this. There will be a seat soon. Please wait a little longer. Can I eat it first? Hey, stop making trouble, you guys. Yes? You disturbing other people. - Get out! - Get out! Let's go. You're interfering with official duties. Get out! Stop, stop, stop. Take it easy. - What the hell? - Come with us. It's bad luck. Why are you here? Why are you following me? Can the police do whatever they want? We're all here to catch murderers. Withdraw. Withdraw, Withdraw. Welcome. Ramen please. Okay, one ramen. - One ramen. - One more ramen. I have an appointment with Kudo-san. When he finishes his sentence, we will come here to celebrate. Please tell me what you know about Kudo-san. Why would he get involved in crime again? I can't say. I am willing to help you catch him. Help us? You want to catch him too, right? Then, I'd like to help. Please tell me. Why do you care so much about Kudo? I promised to help him turn over a new leaf. I... become uncertain. What is really needed, for a person to change their ways. So I'm trying to figure out. Thank you for waiting. Your ramen is ready. One more ramen. Here. All three victims are connected to Makoto Kudo. The Policeman attacked and his gun snatched. Is the officer who received Kudo's mother, when she report her abusive husband. But he didn't take it seriously. So, your husband has been abusing you since six months ago. Why did you just come to the police now? Because he even beat the child now. That's a serious problem. Your husband is also under a lot of pressure, right? Try to have a talk with your husband first. The second victim was an employee of the Welfare Section. She once arranged for Kudo's mother to escape from her husband. What's wrong? You will be moving in two days. Just bring underwear for you and the kids and clothes to wear for a few days. Just act like normal, Don't make your husband suspicious. Don't worry. Auntie will definitely save you. But due to her negligence, her husband found out the address of their new home. And then Kudo's mother was killed. - Mi-chan, the noodles are ready. - Great. - Here. - Thank you. It's good. What is it? Nice drawing. Mi-chan, bring the chopsticks. Alright. Minoru. The noodles are going to be lumpy. I'm sorry I couldn't protect you. I'm sorry. What did the third victim do to Kudo-san? After the death of his mother, Kudo and his brother were admitted to an orphanage. They were abused by the staff there. Being forced to take medication. Makoto, you eat too, and be a good boy today. Open your mouth and drink it. Hurry up. Who is the fourth one? Don't ask. Leave the rest to us. - Thank you for the meal. - Thank you. Welcome. Yo... You don't look so good, do you? Turns out I didn't know anything. I also shamelessly said, I wanted to empathize to my supervision object. Actually, I can't do anything. When I was a kid. Every time my mother went out to get a man, I will be given a 500 yen. Sometimes she don't come home for a week. I'm starving to death. At that time I felt that I was the most miserable person in the world. But later I found out, after I went to prison. It turns out that everyone is like me. The people I met after my crime were all righteous and tough. The police that arrested me. The Pro Bono Lawyers. The judge who made me reflect on my mistake. The prison guard who strictly told me to follow the rules. All these people. As if they represent the will of the whole society. I was told to behave myself from now on. But in fact, society is not that simple. I thought it was because we are ex-convicts, that we felt like they represented the general society. But. When I meet you. That thought is starting to change. Why is that? Because I found out that... Besides us, there are weak people like you. This weakness is precious. It can become your weapon. Because you make mistakes too, that's makes me feel at ease. I feel relaxed around you. The ex-convict need more than the Probation officer. Kayo-chan. It is people like you. Don't fall in love with me! I almost... - Look at that face. - I'm almost fall in love with you. District government leaked personal information Husband killed his wife Defense Attorney "Emma Miyaguchi" Next time, please make sure to make an appointment with us first! Thank you. Please. I am Agawa. I am the probation officer of Makoto Kudo. He is the son of Yukie Toyama, a client you once represented. The police are now looking for him. He is the suspect of a serial murder case. Yes, I know. The police came to see me 3 days ago, Ask me for Toyama's contact address. They should have set up an ambush there. Can I go see Toyama-san? Why? To help Mr. Kudo change his life. There are some things I have to ask him. I'm Miyaguchi. I'd like to discuss something with you, Toyama san. Go after 8 pm That's it. Thank you very much. I'm sorry, can I ask you one more thing. What is it? Why are you willing to be Fumio Toyama's defense attorney? If an abuser receives appropriate treatment, it is possible for him to return to normal. In fact look at it. My client was released from prison and did not repeat the same mistake. I believe this is the 5th years, and he has never missed a psychotherapy session. and he's adhere to the results of diagnosis and treatment. So from a certain point of view, I'm also helping my client reform. Even if the abuser is a cruel murderer, it can't be said that he has no chance of reforming. Don't you think so too? That's all. Chief Suzuki, Kayo Agawa, the Probation officer, is heading to Toyama's house. How did she even get here? Is Kudo a handsome man? If he's gets caught, he will definitely get a death penalty. Ah please come in. Excuse me. Please, have a seat. Thank you. I want to ask you about Makoto-san. Persons released after serving their sentences Toyama Fumio Serving time for murder Attention all police officers. Once you find suspicious people or suspicious vehicles, report immediately. Roger. Everyone, be sure to watch carefully. He is very handy. Very good at making models. So he's always been very handy!. But... our relationship has been strained. We hardly ever speaks. Toyama-san, what does he call you? Dad. But since... Since I beat his mother. He'll never call me that again. Always staring at me, waiting for me to stop. At one point, he even came up and fought back. Why? I threw his brother, Minoru, out of the room. He got hurt here. At that time, Minoru was still very young. He probably can't stand it anymore. Makoto-san said, he didn't have a picture of him as a child. Do you have it? My lawyer use this in court. Evidentiary Materials 1997 Toyama This also has Yukie on it. I haven't seen it again.

Witnesses testify that it was minoru who fled after the shooting. What about the skin scraps in Asai's nails and Makoto Kudo's DNA? Does it make sense? He doesn't want to confess anything.

Agawa, there is one more target for Minoru Kudo. It's Miyagi-san. Makoto Kudo may replace his brother and attack Miyaguchi-san. Revenge? Kudo watched his brother die in front of him. The easiest way to vent anger is revenge. The number you have dialed is temporarily unavailable. We held a supporters' rally to let more people know about it. Please. Aaah... No more victims.... And no more perpetrators either. Let it all end. Come back. If you keep go on like this, you won't be able to become a human being. Come back. People hurting others. Took a life and lost his own. It's really a remorseful thing to do. You asked me why I became a probation officer, right? Yes. I was, attacked by thugs in middle school. I was threatened with a knife and couldn't move. A man saved me. But that man... was stabbed in my place and died. After that... I've been wanting to forget about that incident. Graduating high school, going to college, then working. I thought if I could focus on something else, I would forget about it. But no matter what I do, I can't forget. When I got sick and resigned from the company. I saw a man wandering in the street. All of a sudden I thought of the person who attacked me. I want to get out of there right away. At that time, a woman came running. She was angry at the man. She's snapped and said, "You can't give up." And gave him the red bean bread she had brought with him. Took his hand and walked away. I caught up with them and asked. She told me that she is a probation officer. That man is an ex-convict. I... The word "You can't give up" that she just said. I feel like it was meant for me. I think because my life is saved by someone. I have to do something in return. The person who attacked me. If there were people who cared about him, maybe he wouldn't have committed the crime. So I decided to become a probation officer. You love Minoru-san very much, don't you? After leaving the orphanage. I could not even take care of myself, so I left him alone. He... When he was a child, he was a crybaby. But... Mom... After she was killed, he stopped crying. He was beside our mother when she's fallen to the ground. Calling out to his mother, and trembling all over. So I... Held him tightly. He's really trembling. Obviously, he has grown up But he's still trembling. Kudo-san. You have to be punished for the crime you committed. You will put in jail again. Yes. Wait until the next time you are released from prison and return to society. You may have a hard time finding a job. May not be able to rent a place. Relying only on law and social welfare. It can not help you This is the reality. But... If you feel sad, come to me. I will help you. When you're in pain, tell me.. Please tell me clearly. Become a new person. Please do your best. One day we will eat ramen together. It's okay. I will defend him. Thank you I have to go back. Why are you alive? That words... Becoming a probation officer is the answer I found. Take care of yourself. You too. Why are you still alive? What the hell. obviously I wanted to scare you. It turns out we both are scare each other. Darn. Midori-san. Can you go somewhere with me? Sea... Please don't shout out loud, all of a sudden. Right here? Hey Kayo-chan. Why did you bring me here? Because you are my friend. Is that so? Is that so? Don't fall in love with me! English Subtitle by M.K.
