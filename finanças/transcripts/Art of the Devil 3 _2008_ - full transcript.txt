Dit... You evil bastard. Is there no end to your greed? You can't digest all the black magic you've devoured. It's going to eat you alive. Today, I meet my fate. I can't help you. That's why I came to see you, Master. You were the one who told me that if I worshiped the three-eyed god then I could master all black magic. Give me the three-eyed god. Pawn was able to worship it. But you'll never be able to. The god resides in whom he pleases. You just don't want to give him to me. Let's see if he will stay in me or not. Give me the third eye. Give it to me, Master. Damn it! The third eye is no longer with you? Old bastard! That boy will ask for a ride again today. Why not? He does every other day. I see no harm in it. They say that this boy was a troublemaker. You teach him everyday. Yet he never learns. He has bad karma. It's bad karma. You got yourself involved, didn't you? Listen to me. Black magic, like all other weapons is not evil by nature. But those beguiled by weapons are the evil ones. If you want the battle to end then you must first stop fighting. But if you still practice black magic then you'll be stuck in this eternal cycle. Have you thought this through? Once you practice black magic it sticks with you until you die. ARTOF THE DEVIL 3 (Long Khong 2) Dear soul, come back. Come back to my son. Come back to my son. Dear soul, come back. Come back to my son. What are they doing, Pen? Umm... They're calling back his soul. I've come to take you home. Come home with me, okay? Do you believe in such things? Give the medicine on schedule. Good morning, Doctor. Good morning. Let's start with Panor's case today. Okay. Rintong... Rintong... Calm down, Rintong. Rintong, calm down. Rintong, sit down. Calm down, Rintong. Rintong, sit down. How is Panor's condition? She is still depressed. Okay, I'm going to change her medication. But it might affect her unborn child. Keep her under observation. And send me a full report. Yes, Doctor. Aod... How did you get inside? Visitors aren't allowed. How can I be a visitor when I live inside your heart? Don't be a sap. A sapling in your heart. Where are you going? Hey! Wait up! Where are you going? Father asked me to pick up Ta. He called to ask for help. Your royal chariot awaits out front. Stop playing around, Aod. Stop it! Aod! It's been over ten years since you've been home. Ever since your dad got remarried. Do you know how much we all missed you? Especially Grandpa. He always asks about you. Say hello to Grandpa. Hello, Grandpa. You look more like your mother everyday. Don't worry about your tuition. I can support my only grandson. Thank you, Grandpa. Ta, take your things into the house. I'll be right there. Okay. Ta... That's your great grandmother. She doesn't speak much. She is a spirit medium. Put your things away. You can sleep in your mother's room. Put your things away and get some rest. We'll have dinner later. Thank you, Auntie. Who are you? Huh? I asked who you are? Pawn's ghost? Why are you following me? Huh? What? Pawn is dead? Damn it! Who is that? Bastard. Can you remember anything now? I preserved your mother's dead body because I knew this day would come. The day when she could return. Return? We tried everything to bring her back to life. I heard it's possible with black magic. And I met a man who could. Tell me what I need to do. As long as Duen comes back to life. Your daughter will return. But not in this body. We must steal a soul. Steal a soul? Yes. Lure someone's soul from their body. And invite your mom's soul in its place. The soul we decided to steal... The body we decided to use belonged to Panor. It was retribution for all the pain she caused your mother. So we waited. We waited for the right time. But you couldn't chant the mantra. So the ceremony failed. Ta, hurry up and chant. Chant! You were only a boy then. But now you're grown up. It's your chance to redeem yourself. This is an old family photo album. With pictures of you as a boy. And this notebook... Is your mother's diary. She explicitly told me to keep it until the suitable time. Now's the right time for you to read it. Pen... Bring me my diary. Ta, my dear... I don't know how old you will be when you read this diary. But I'm certain that if Duen has given it to you then it is the right time for you to know the truth. Ta, from the day you were born I always knew that you were the most important thing to me. Everyone took good care of me. Especially your father. Drink this traditional health potion. My mother made it herself. It was a time of great happiness that I will never forget. It was a time when we were all together. Until... That woman disrupted our lives. How can I help you? What brings you all the way here? Duen's sister is taking the nursing exam. She wants to find her a tutor. So I thought I'd ask you. Is that it? You could have just called. We just hired a new teacher. She's on her way here. It's a special amulet. The owner never used it. The 9 marks are still there. They're very clear on the back. Here she is. Hello, sir. You have to memorize these terms. Yes, Teacher. Here's your homework. Is school out already? That's right. Thank you, Teacher for tutoring my sister everyday. I know it's a long distance. You're welcome. It's helping me learn my way around. Next year Ta will be entering school. Perhaps you could tutor him as well? It would be my pleasure. Boo! What are you doing? Can't you see I'm studying? Duen... I bought the fish that you ordered. Thank you. Excuse me while I make dinner. Don't mind me. Why don't you join us for dinner? Mr. Prawase... Is there any land for sale around here? It's hard to find these days. But there is one plot. If you're interested. Of course. Whose is it? It belongs to me. Good thing the teacher bought our land. Our orchard is earning less this year. I can tell that you like the teacher. What are you trying to say, Mother? Just that I approve if you want to take her as a second wife. But why would she want me? Here... Just go to this address. Duen... It's time for your health potion. Thank you. Guess what? I have some good news. I passed the nursing exam. I have you to thank for helping me all along. From now on... I'll look after you. Don't worry. Prawase takes good care of me. Duen... Duen... Are you okay? Duen! Duen! Dad! Something's wrong with Duen! Dad, help me! Duen, what's wrong? Duen! Duen! No! Dad, help me! Duen! Dad! Help! Duen! No! Duen! Duen, are you okay? Duen! Duen! Mom! I'll go get the doctor. 1... 2... 3... You may have thought I died naturally. But the truth is I was poisoned. Your father killed me. Mom... Where are you, Mom? I don't want to be like this anymore... I don't want to be like this anymore... There's only one way to destroy the curse. Eat the flesh of that who cursed you. And all their black magic will flow to you. But you may go insane. I sacrifice myself to the three-eyed god. What's that stench? You're in too deep to escape, Dit. All the demons are devouring you from inside. The three-eyed god is the only thing that can control your demons. But if your powers are real then why do you need the three-eyed god from me? Om... wake up, rise up... Wake up, all damned spirits... Guardians of the forests, mountains and fields... Ghosts of the jungles and plains... All the spirits in the cemetery... Come... come... rise up... I invite you to this gathering... Lords of the earth, water, wind and fire... All wandering spirits in the forest... I invite... I invite you all... Come... come... rise up... Aod. Yes? Did you manage to find him? Yes, I did. But he raised his fee to 50,000. 50,000 baht? Then 50,000 it is. Now we have to fetch the teacher's body. Relax. Soon you'll be back where you belong. Hurry! Or the witching hour will pass. Ta, light the candle for me. I haven't seen you in a while. Still as sexy as before. When do we begin? What are you doing to me? Aod, help me. What are you doing? Step aside. Hurry. The witching hour is here. Give me your hand. I hope you won't fail like last time. Start chanting, boy. Om... Wake up, rise up. Wake up, all damned spirits. Guardians of the forests, mountains, and fields. Ghosts of the jungles and plains... All the spirits in the cemetery... Come... come... rise up... I invite you to this gathering. Lords of the earth, water, wind, and fire. All wandering spirits in the forest... I invite you all... Come... come... rise up... Pen, hurry up! Damn it. Speed things up. The witching hour is passing. Out! Out! What are you doing to me? Don't hurt me... Let me go. My baby... Don't take my baby! Ta! Call your mother! Hurry up! Mother, come back and stay with us. Your daughter's soul is in this body now. Don't look so bewildered. Help her get up. Duen... Dear soul, thank you. Stay in her body... Ta... my son... I've tied her spirit to the body. Don't let the string fall off. Burn her rotten corpse. Or else wandering spirits will possess it. And don't forget. Bury the fetus and mirror in the cemetery. Is there anything else? No. I just feel that your family picked the right body. Mother. My baby! Someone help me, please! Don't tell me that shirt is for Duen. No. It's for me. For you? But it's too small for you. Or is it a new fashion trend? I've been meaning to tell you. My baby! Duen! Why don't you try it on right now? The color looks good on you. Ta, I'm having a baby. Kiss it. No thanks. Come on. Aod, stop playing. It's dirty. No, it's not. It's our baby. Father... Give it a kiss. Give it a kiss. I told you it's dirty. Sniff it. Go on, smell it. Take a deep whiff. It's smells beautiful. Ta, take a sniff. My baby smells great. Ta, do you realize we haven't been this happy in a while. Damn it! How did the teacher get the three-eyed god? Damn maggots... Give me back my food. Don't steal my food. Stay away from me. Give it back. Leave me alone. Duen! Duen, what's wrong? Duen! Take her inside. Take her inside. What's wrong, Duen? What's wrong, Duen? Why is she like this? Someone who's returned from the dead can't be expected to be totally normal. Don't forget that she's been dead for 13 years. Her spirit may have roamed and seen many evil things. Hold her tight. I'll sprinkle holy water on her. Okay. Relax, Duen. Duen, you'll be fine. Duen... Duen... Everything is fine. Just relax, dear. Duen... Dear soul, come back here... Bring back the remaining soul... Stay here with your right soul. Don't go anywhere far. Dear soul, come stay in this body... If what you say is true, then the three-eyed god has rejected her soul. That will make it easier for me to steal the teacher's body. Here's your reward. Drink this herbal potion. Duen! Duen, no! Duen, no! You keep trying to run away from me. Why? Are you so smitten with that teacher? Are you going to leave me? Mom! Mom! Bastard! I said to bury them well. Or we'll all be cursed. I can't save you. The three-eyed god rejected your sou I. Go ahead and leave this body. I won't leave. I have a right to use her body. I won't go. Then I'll invoke the three-eyed god. I'd really like to know just how much pain you can stand. Leave and become a wandering ghost. Damn it! Mom! What? What are you doing to my mom? Damn it, you bit me! Little bastard! You want to die? Bastard. Mom... Hi, Duen. What did you guys do to me? Duen... Is something wrong? You wanted to reunite your family, right? Bitch! What are you doing to me? I really wonder... As you watch each family member die one by one... One by one... How will you feel? Let me go! I'll make you watch. And experience it. The death of every family member. A ghost! A ghost has come to destroy us! A ghost has come to destroy us! Let me go. A great calamity! Grandma! Grandma! Ghost... Ghost... There's no ghost here! A ghost is coming! I'm going to start with your mother. There's no ghost here. Ghost! Ghost! Ghost! Come here! Come here! Great Grandma! You're a demon witch! Can I ask you a question? Everyone in your family is so in love with each other, right? Stop it, you psycho! What else are you going to do? Grandma! Grandma! Great Grandma! Till death do you part... Great Grandma! Aod! Pen! Pen! Aod! Aod! Help me, please! Pen! Great Grandma! Aod! Help me! Pen. Pen! Stop it, please. Don't do it. I beg you. Pen! Pen! Pen! Pen! Pen, I'm here! Pen! Pen! Aod! Help me! Our baby is dead... Our baby! Aod! Help me. It hurts! Don't leave me, Aod. Please don't leave. I never will. Aod, don't leave me. I'm here. Everything will be fine. Just relax. I'm here now. Time for your son-in-law to die. Help me! Aod! I can't get it loose. Aunt Pen! Aod! Aod! Ta, what happened? Auntie, loosen the noose. I'll jam the windmill. Aod! Aod! Aod! Loosen the noose. Aod! Aod! Aod! Ready for the sweet romantic scene? Stop it... Don't kill him. I'm begging you. Aod! No! Aunt Pen! Loosen the noose! Hurry! I can't hold it much longer! Aod! No! Pen! Pen! Pen! Pen! Aod! No! Aod! Aod! Aod! Aod! No! Aod! No! Aod! Next up is your evil daughter. Don't hurt my daughter. Let us go. Let you go? That would be nothing compared to the pain I've suffered. Aod! Aunt Pen! Aunt Pen! Ta, what happened? I don't know either. Auntie... Brace yourself... Great Grandma is also dead. And Grandpa... Where is he? It looks like your daughter wants to see you. What are you going to do? Stop! Stop, please! In that case... Can you call her in a loud voice? Dad! Grandpa! Grandpa! Dad! Stop! Don't go over there! Ta, don't go! Scream all you want. They can't hear you. Look at them. Auntie and nephew racing to their death. At this rate your happy family will be dead too soon. That wouldn't be any fun. Blind their eyes. Dad! Grandpa! Grandpa! Aunt Pen! Ta! Aunt Pen! Aunt Pen! Ta, where are you? Where are you? Aunt Pen! Pen! Dad! Don't go over there! Don't go! You bitch! You bitch! Just kill me! I won't kill you yet. I'm going to crush your living soul the same way you did mine. And I'm going to make you watch. No... What are you going to do? What's about to happen to your darling daughter. Dad... Don't hurt my daughter. Hurt me instead. I give up. I'll do anything. Anything at all! Slow down. I've just started. You'll both get what you deserve. Dad! This scorpion will kill your unborn grandson. Both of you will experience the pain you caused me. No! Now you know how much it hurts when someone inflicts pain on you. My daughter. Your nephew is the only one remaining. You evil bitch! And what you did to me wasn't evil? Aunt Pen! Aunt Pen! Aunt Pen! Why? Why are you doing this to us? Why hurt us like this? Is that a question? Why don't you ask yourself? The reason why. Stay away! It turned out this way because your family started it. Dit! Don't test me. I'll kill you. Come reside in me. I will worship you well. Think of me. And you won't be in pain. Listen to me! Give me the three-eyed god! And I won't kill you. Say it! Hurry! Do you want to end up like me? Say it! Your body is full of sin. I will help you cleanse it. I sacrifice my body as a slave to the three-eyed god. Stupid bitch! Is there no end to your greed? You can't digest all the black magic you've devoured. It's going to eat you alive. Today, I meet my fate. I can't help you. Grandpa... You should know that once you play with black magic you'll be caught in its evil cycle. In the end... you will reap your own evil deeds. Your holiness... What should I do? I shouldn't have tried black magic. I can only take you this far. Listen... Listen to me carefully. If you want your suffering to end then you must start with yourself. Otherwise... you will be trapped in this karmic cycle. Don't forget... our evil deeds turn the wheels of karma. Our evil chain of deeds. Don't be sad. Don't you remember? You made the choice yourself. Hey! Hey! What's the commotion? What's going on? Have you decided who you want to bewitch? Myself. I want everybody to love and desire me. One year later Hello? Paw, telephone. Hello? Hey, Ta! When did Ta's father die? Great! I haven't seen him since graduation. That's right. We can stay at his house. So we can chill in the rustic atmosphere. Hey, Ta! Black magic... Once you have tried it will stick with you until you die.
