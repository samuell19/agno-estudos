If the human population was halved, would that halve the amount of forests that get burned? If the human population fell by 99%. Would that similarly reduce the amount of poison produced? Somewhere on earth, someone was thinking... that all life needs protecting. What's wrong? Shinichi? What are you doing? A snake went in my arm. There's a snake inside me. What's going on? Don't take it off. Are you alright? Sleeping with these on is bound to give you bad dreams. Goodnight. Good morning. What a total failure... I'm off to work. Finish your breakfast and don't forget your bento. And get your act together, okay? My right arm feels kind of numb. You had that power cord around it. You were out of it last night. Bye. What are you doing? The kids left ages ago. PARASYTE What a wimpy reaction. Get lost. Suppose I had a heart attack? Don't exaggerate. Are those tears in your eyes? I'm not a kid. You're tearing up. Sensitive as ever! Leave me alone. What the hell are you doing? I don't believe it. It began in 1952, with the foundation of the ECSC. Which stands for the European Coal and Steel Community. It was proposed in 1950 by Schuman, France's Foreign Minister. To prevent France and Germany from entering armed conflict again. lzumi, over here. lzumi, fantastic! Nice shot. Subconscious Hand Disease Fail... failure. Eat... not possible. What a failure. What are you? What.are.you. What happened to my hand? My.hand. Eaten. You ate it'? In other news, the IAEA, International Atomic Energy Agency. I. A. E. A. I. A. E. A. International. Mum, I'm starving! Get me something to eat! Me too. Welcome back. I'm awake but the nightmare won't end. I'm begging you, give my hand back. Not possible now. Information gathering is priority. Since when could you speak? One day to learn Japanese. Shinichi, are you up? Yes, Mum! Everything's okay. Like hell it is. "Mum", meaning "mother". The birthing entity that now rears you. Commonly paired with a father but yours is predeceased. Know what a hospital is? A facility treating illness or injury. They'll chop you clean off. I refuse. I draw essential nutrients from your blood. Severance would cause my death. Exactly my point. But you'd lose your hand. We both suffer. What the hell's going on? The basic question of existence. Where are you from? Where are we from and where are we bound? Do you know yourself? Just shut the hell up! My first experience of emotion was regret I didn't occupy your brain. My brain? You want to take it over? Now I've taken root in your arm, it's no longer possible. Despair overwhelms me. That's my line. I can't cram all day long. People will think it's odd. Proving you don't normally study. Shut up. To understand human society, I need information. My hand will be smarter than my head. Incorrect use of future tense. It's already happened. You piss me off, you freak. I reject that derogatory term. What do I call you then? If you need a name, make it "Migi". Migi. From the word for "right"'? Correct. Not exactly original. A contest based on an act of killing. How fascinating. We're in school, keep your voice down. I must know more. Show me everything. The former is close-quarter combat. This is long range killing. I said keep quiet. What martial training do you have? It's not really my thing. You're late, Satomi. Sorry, I got held up. Typical. You joined us at last? Try that stunt again and you're dead. But... What? I'm sorry. Coming along nicely. Don't be shy. I'm not an artistic genius like you. I always liked your paintings. Let me guess. It's modelled on Satomi? What? It's from my imagination. This is female, though? - You're at a sensitive age, right? - It's someone special. What's up with you both? I'll re-do it. He's sulking. Neurotic, aren't you? You wish to copulate with that female. With Satomi Murano. Have you lost your mind? The slight change in blood flow gives you away. Enlarge your reproductive organ. Are you kidding? It's not a joke. I'm genuinely interested. Stop it, for chrissakes! Good evening. 268 yen and 980 yen makes it 1,248 yen. Where to? Where are you going? Motive & Method Unknown - Rash of Murders Citywide The Work of a Mysterious Cult? What are you doing? We're getting off. Keep yourself hidden. Over there... in the distance. I sense brainwaves. For the first time... it's my own kind. So you're not the only one? Directly ahead... 200 metres. Let's go. I don't want to. Nothing to see, kids. I should acknowledge my fellow beings. Okay, but behave yourself. Is this it? Yes. The other is 5 metres away. Wait. Stop. One of us, eh? Good timing. It's great here. If you wait... food just walks right in. This is what we really look like. What's going on? The human brain's still intact? That's not good. Not good at all. Shinichi, run. I sense murderous intent. He's very upset that you remain human. Shinichi! Stop! If you attack this human, I'll kill you. I understand that. You can't survive without your host. Then jump ship over to me. Move? That's impossible at this late stage. You didn't pay attention in class. A limb-to-brain migration is tricky, I agree. But from an arm to an arm it should be straightforward. Look, I made space. Come on over. Ditch that body. You'd be better off under my control, right? Migi, you won't make the switch, will you? Don't even consider it! I'll cutoff his head so you'll have no choice. Are you mad? Where's my body? Is he dead? Our martial training paid off. You killed one of your own kind. Unavoidably. Your death would be mine too. There's no guarantee migration would work. You saved my life. Not for your sake. I only value my own life. Maybe I should have tried to move. Hey. It's closed today? Go easy on the drinking and have your wife come see me. Okay, I'll tell her. Get well soon. Thank you very much. I'm nearly done. Wait a minute. I'll shop for dinner. Good evening. 3 servings of mince, please? Certainly. No meat for me today. You love meat. You're not hungry? Not really. Strange boy. Anything on your mind? You seem preoccupied lately. I'm nearly a Senior. I've just got normal concerns about my future. I see. In Kanazawa prefecture, the body found in an abandoned car. Has been identified as a local 41 year-old male. I can't tell Mum about this. She doesn't need to know. If I do nothing, victims will pile up. I should tell the world about you guys. Why? I'm the only one who knows. I can't just stay silent. They'll do experiments on us. That's tough luck. I've got to stop your buddies. I can't follow your reasoning. My colleagues are just securing nutrition. I get it from your blood supply but they must fend for themselves. But why eat people, of all things? Why does it bother you so much? Don't you get it? Human life is precious. What's precious is one's own life. That's all that counts to me. But you're just a creature. You guys eat cows, pigs, chicken, fish... all kinds of other beings. Compared to you... our limited menu is quite modest. Let's just say, our values differ. In any case, if you try to harm me, I'll do all in my power to prevent you. I can easily keep you alive with no tongue. Get rid of your eyes and ears, too. Wow, you're genuinely terrified. You devil. Devil? Okay, thank you very much. What's wrong? One victim's stomach contained a human finger. Meaning he ate someone? Yes. Meanwhile, this cannibal here... was found without a head. Sir, what the hell's going on? It's like the end of the world. Shinichi, I've researched this "devil" phenomenon. The closest life form I found is homo sapiens. You've all got different paths and different goals ahead... but I hope you'll celebrate the small milestones on your way... and never give up, no matter what obstacles lie in your path. Shinichi. I sense brainwaves. One of my kind is near. You're kidding. Don't look. The other will sense us and be on their guard. I hope they don't want to do battle here. So while Mr. Matsuyama, is in hospital after his crash, let me introduce the new chemistry teacher who'll replace him. This way, please. It's her. You've got to be kidding. How do you do, everyone. Look away. She'll notice us. I'm Ryoko Tamiya. Nice to meet you. Don't be so scared. Come closer. I can hear your heart pounding from here. Don't worry. If there was to be a fight, it'd already be over. Besides, my colleague in your hand knows I'm not violent. My name's Migi. It's fascinating that you share that body with a human. It's not exactly my preference. You... what are you planning in our school? Planning? I just want a quiet existence. We've much to discuss, but it's impossible here. Is she your girlfriend? Come see me after school. We'll talk at length then. Of course. Don't speak for me. I won't talk to your kind. Master lzumi, address your teacher with respect. See you. Bossy jerk. We should talk to her. What if it's a trap? She's quite remarkable. She took over a human brain yet retains its identity and functions in society. And as a teacher of all things. What extraordinary genius. I must know more. Why did you drag me out here? Two more approaching. 10 metres away. Two more? What's going on, Ms. Tamiya? They're a metre away. I can see that. Allow me to introduce, Mr. Hideo Shimada. Hey. You're both students so I thought you'd get along. And this policeman is... No need to tell him my name. Then let's call him Mr. A. You've infiltrated the police too'? I'm impressed. This is Shinichi lzumi and Mr. Migi. You're only in its arm... amazing. I'm not a freak show. You're inviting these losers into our network, Tamiya? The data is invaluable. What network? I told you not to talk. We need to help one another to prosper here. There used to be daily reports of gruesome murders, but that's quietened down now, right? But more people are going missing. What of it? Your feeding strategy's just more discrete. We try to chose those whose loss won't be noticed. We share such information in order to learn. It's vital that we have a network. Are you suggesting we join it? Don't lump me in with you freaks. We're freaks, are we? However you look at it. I'm attempting a little experiment. Mr. A and I tried having sex. With the result that I'm now pregnant. So here's the question. What is this thing growing inside me? Both bodies are human so the embryo should be too. Right. A perfectly-normal human baby. Which begs the question, what are we? Unable to reproduce... stuck in a cycle of cannibalism. What kind of life form is that? For heaven's sake... what are we doing on this earth? I couldn't care less. In any case, we protect ourselves. Think about joining forces. I absolutely refuse. I'm talking to Migi. At the least, I advise you to abstain from any form of opposition. If it comes down to it, your entire class... wouldn't survive 3 seconds. Consider all the students my hostage. That girlfriend of yours, too. I'll see you around. Shinichi, watch out for Mr. A. He's just dying to kill us. Women with heavy make-up have an awful medicinal taste. Did you clean up the leftovers? I like a clean break room. You're not eating? I'm in the middle of an experiment. Gross, how can you eat that? It's bad for you. Ryoko Tamiya, you really want that loser on our side? If we intend to co-exist with human beings, Shinichi and Migi provide valuable research material. You should keep practicing human facial expressions. Especially smiling. It's the key to a smooth transition among them. Like mine, eh? They say that new restaurant on Main street is really good. Let's go one of these days. Don't be embarrassed. Let's hang out sometime. I reckon we shouldn't go out too much. There's weird stuff going on. But we haven't had a decent chat lately. No need to worry about me. Go with a colleague. Wait, Shinichi. Something's up. Tell your mother. No, it's not. Don't take me for a fool. I'm not blind, you know. I'm not a kid so I'm bound to change. Your mother just wants to help. How old do you think I am? You're stifling me. Leave me alone, I'll be fine. Epidermal tissue damage from hot oil or water known as a "scar". When you look at her scar, your blood pressure rises. I'm intrigued as to why. It's none of your business. Yes, it is. I must understand my host's reactions. It was a pan of hot tempura oil. I knocked it off the stove when I was 4 years old. Mum caught it and saved me with her bare hands. It still pains her when it rains. Sacrificing the self to protect others. The most perplexing human characteristic. This painting is of your mother, correct? 20 metres ahead, Shinichi, a contact. It's Mr. A. Lying in wait for us. I sense his blood lust. He's serious this time. What do we do? He's stronger than me. It won't be as easy as before. I've got plan A or B. Choose one. Plan A. Okay, run for that fish market, there. Don't say a word. You're not a pacifist, after all. I differ from Ryoko Tamiya. What's the point in comrades fighting? Comrades? You and me? Why can't you leave us be? Killing that chef let the police get their hands on a body. Which has lead to a lot of pressure on our kind... I knew only one of us could kill like that. You're a danger. I'm counting on you to follow the plan, Shinichi. Shinichi! Quick! What's this? The blood won't stop. Blood loss will soon cause the body to expire. And naturally, you with it. Ignoring the human's potential to fight was your downfall. Killed by a human. I don't believe it. Why such trauma? Physically you're unharmed. That was a human body. I stabbed a human being to death. It ceased to be human long ago. You think it's so black and white? Human emotions continue to mystify me. What was the plan B? There wasn't one. It was just to reassure you. Hello. 3 mince meat patties, please. My son loves them. I bet he does. This body is no good. I need a new body. Amputate. Separate. Recombine. Revive. Amputate. Separate. Recombine. Revive. Are you alright? Amputate. Separate. Recombine. Revive. Shinichi, we're in trouble! What is it? 150 metres... 140 metres... It's getting closer. Not another? They just don't stop. 30 metres. 20 metres. Please, make them go past, make them go past. 10 metres. What is it? It's stopped. In front of your door. Give me a break. Don't tell me. It's unlocked. How come it has our key? These brainwaves are... Mum? Shinichi, no... Mum, right? It's Mr. A! Don't be absurd, he's dead. Welcome back, Mum. Mr. A is back to life, Shinichi. Shut up, Migi! He quit the cop and took over your mum. Shut up or I'll slice you clean off! Put the knife away, Shinichi! How pathetic. Didn't reach his brain and now you're at his mercy. Mum, I owe you an apology. So stop being silly and I'll tell you everything. Open your eyes, Shinichi. She's not human. Shut up! You're the monster freak. Mum, I'm sorry about this morning. So, this hand thing... I've been meaning to tell you but it's kind of awkward. I didn't want to burden you with it. And I was always the cry-baby, constantly running to you. I'm so grateful to you. Really I am, so please... Please... Tell me it's all a lie! Mother... Shinichi! I destroyed his heart. The human is dead. As you will be in a few minutes. That's what you get for not reaching his brain. So the PV equals the nRT. It's known as the "ldeal Gas Law". You're up? It's a miracle. I went deep inside you to seal the wound. Then used my stem cells to repair the damage. I found my way back through your veins. It was a huge gamble but I guess it worked. So then... it wasn't a dream. Mum. Forget it. Mr. A took her. You've been away for ages, what's up'? Shinichi? Are you okay? Where are you going? Leave me alone. Shinichi? The news reported a policeman's body was found near your house. Was that you? Where's Mr. A? I thought you'd killed him. We tried but he survived in Shinichi's mother's body. Then he nearly killed us. Hence the unapproved two day absence? Where's Mr. A? I don't know. Don't lie, he's in your network. Even if I knew, I wouldn't tell you. Even though he's out of control? We have our own individuality too. Mr. A is belligerent and paranoid. He's a dangerous character. Then why did you introduce us? As an experiment. Simply that. A simple experiment? Thanks to you, my mother died! You want to fight? If you do, I guess I've no choice. By any chance are you swapping cells? Fascinating. You two are really unique. Wait! School was out ages ago, Master lzumi. I'll find him... no matter how many years it takes. Then I'll kill him. Mr. Hirama. Regarding the cop killing, the prints off the steel pipe match those off the back door of the Chinese restaurant. A serial perp, huh? The higher-ups are trying to hide it, but that cannibal thing with the finger... it's been confirmed. Do you mind? I'm eating. Aren't those photos bad enough? Reckon that rumour's true, about some sort of human parasite? Let's get to the bottom of it before the higher-ups put a lid on it. We never get off here. What's the plan? I haven't decided. Just thought we'd stroll. Hoping to bump into Mr. A? You've got your radar. It's an inefficient search method. Let me calculate the odds. Found someone? Dead ahead, about 200 metres. I don't know Shinichi, but it's a large number. Here in this crowd? How many? It's hard to say. Several, I think. That many? Shinichi. What is it? They're not in the crowd. They're above it. No sign of Mr. A, though. Trying to become politicians too? This is an incredible development. I thought Ms. Tamiya was impressive but those guys are entering politics. Hoping to legalise cannibalism, no doubt. They're obviously out to create the most favourable environment for us. In just a few months, they've made incredible intellectual and organisational advances. You're so excited, you're an odd shape. Maybe the day is near when parasites control human destiny. Don't sound so happy. I'm not voting for a monster. It's a mockery of the democratic process. Are you Shinichi lzumi? Yes. So you're by yourself now? Filed a missing person report? Yes, I did. How are you supporting yourself? Mother had some savings. Really? You must be worried. You heard about the murder of a policeman near here, right? Know anything about that? Not especially. I see. Let's hope Mother turns up soon. Thank you very much. Migi. 'Morning. It must be tough. Let's hope they find your Mum soon. What are you doing about food and stuff? It's no big deal. If you like, I could make something for you? It's him. Good morning. This is Shimada, the new transfer student. I'm Hideo Shimada. Nice to meet you. I should avoid your right hand, huh? What the hell are you doing here? What are you talking about? Make friends, guys. What's going on? See you. What's up between you? Stay away from him. 'Morning. Hi. Early morning lover's tiff? What? Not at all. Was that the hot, new guy everyone's talking about? Yes, that's right. He's been sent to watch you. And he's well-positioned to exploit Satomi, your weak-spot. How dare they. He's fast developing beyond human abilities. Physically he far surpasses normal human values. Originally he was a weak specimen. Cellular combination for sure. It's a really interesting case. I can see why you're obsessed. From the stand point of co-existence, they may play a far more important role than I first thought. I don't understand. When I repaired the damage to your heart with my own cells, I couldn't retrieve them all so some are still circulating. Well, hurry and get them back. They're distributed throughout your circulatory system. It's too late to recover them. So, I'm gradually becoming more like you? How gross. By the way, where are we going now? I thought we'd take a little trip. More random searching for Mr. A? I sense mental changes in you too. I wish you'd stop this. I can't do that. I don't understand the desire for revenge. You can't bring back the dead and you put us in danger. Besides, to tell you the truth, I've got a problem with my body. A problem? Since that incident, I sleep 4 hours a day. Well, I sleep 8 hours. In my case, it's a total shut-down. My senses become paralysed and it's like I'm dead. What's worse is that it's unexpected. So if I meet an enemy while you're asleep... I'm afraid you'd be on your own. It's here. I'm so sleepy. Wait. Sorry, I'm off. Hey, wait. "How to recognise a parasite"? Pull out a hair and it wriggles, apparently. It's all over the web. Ouch. Not wriggling, huh. What's going on'? I ordered them to limit killing. Their cover was blown by the hair-pulling. It's a problem. Maybe your favourite freak is behind it all. I'll shut him up. Shimada and I are watching him. Rather than presenting a danger to us... they're valuable specimens. Experimenting is fine and good but don't take risks. I'm working to secure a future for every one of us. When I'm elected, I'll devise a system to supply us with humans. You can stop worrying. Ms. Tamiya. How is the child? It moves around and I feel heavy and awkward. Be honest, how are you getting by? I grab whatever. I better make something. Let's go. Humour her. Your nutritional imbalance is bad for me too. MY apologies. A chance for copulation too. That's all you think about. Talking to yourself? No, not at all. You've been kind of scary recently. It must be hard with your mum and all but it's like you'd changed. You used to be a geeky bookworm type. But that's what was cute about you. Get lost. But things are fine again. You're still your old self. You're complaining? Maybe we bought too much. What is it? I heard something. Poor thing. Watch out! It's dead. It just died. What are you doing? Why did you do that? Right, the sanitation crew won't like that. That's not what I mean! Think of the poor animal. But it's dead. It's not a dog any more. Just a dog-shaped lump of flesh. You are Shinichi lzumi, right? What's the matter? I'm sorry. I took you for someone else. Migi, what did I do wrong? "A dog-shaped lump of flesh". That's something I would say. I see. I've blown it now. Excuse me, Ms. Tamiya? Yes, may I help you? Well... I do believe... You might be pregnant? What about it? Obviously it's wonderful news... but would you come to my office? You're home. We let ourselves in. Welcome home. Sorry to surprise you out of the blue. So it's true then. The school contacted us. Dear... it's not her. This person is not Ryoko. It's not Ryoko. Don't be silly. Dear please, call the police! Are you mad? Dear! It's me. I've got two bodies for the break room. I heard you quit school. I never imagined I'd have to leave over a thing like that. Take Shimada with you. He's responsible for keeping an eye on you. Besides, he's adjusted perfectly to human society. I'm not so sure. Both he and I are experimenting with life on a human diet. Shimada too? No metabolic concerns so far. If we discover that we don't need to prey on humans, then the problem's solved. We'll be able to co-exist. I can't see Shimada doing that. If you can adapt to human society, there's no issue. Wait a sec. They hijacked human bodies. How could we ever trust them? Hi. I asked him to model for us. You want to draw him? No, I'm fine. Worried what Shinichi will think? I've no idea what you mean. Okay, let's change poses. Can you put your hand on your hip? Look this way a little more. Perfect. Such a non-Japanese build. Wonder if you're even human? Just kidding. Why did you have to do that? It was going so well. One, two, three... four, five, six... seven, eight people. Did you hear that? I sense the killing urge from Shimada. In school? Where is he? Don't put us in harm's way. I can't just stand by. Paint Remover It'll be quick. Don't move or it'll hurt. Please stay still everyone. Get out of here! Quick, Yuko, move! Satomi's voice? From the Art Room on the 3rd floor. Shimada's brain patterns are in disarray. We should stay away. We shouldn't approach. Shinichi! Get out of my way! Calm down, Shinichi. I can't... I can't bear it. Control your breathing. My heart... it's going to burst. You're fine. Your heart will be fine. You've got to trust me. You're fine. Shimada! He's totally lost control. I'm going to kill him. The odds are with him. Tamiya. Hideo Shimada. This is a disgrace. I'm losing my mind. Help me, please. I hate those that draw attention to themselves. Run, Shinichi! Time to jump. You're safe now, Satomi. Team 5 on the 3rd floor. Commencing inspection now. Copy that. What an incredible hold on life. I still sense him. He's heading to the roof. So much for co-existence. See you, Shimada. Shinichi, she's here. I'll disappear for a while. Do you know how many died? About 13, apparently. I should've killed you both ages ago. Kill me and my unborn child dies. Can you kill a human child? You really intend to give birth and raise a human? It's all part of the experiment. I've had enough. Shinichi lzumi... Motherhood is a mysterious thing. When a human becomes a mother she acquires powers, beyond what should be theoretically possible. I need to know if it's true. You'll find Mr. A here. Is he there? Don't let it trick you. I understand. Don't mess up her body. It's my Mum. Aim for the neck only, okay? Shinichi, this is bad. You should get away. What are you talking about? The fatigue is kicking in. I'm hopelessly sleepy. Why now, for chrissakes!? I can't help it. Get out of here. It's too late for that. Please, do your best. Migi. Let me do this, at least... Are you serious? How did you two survive together? Whatever. Those aren't human moves. What's happening? Mum, I'll cut you loose, okay? Stop it, darling! What's the matter? It's mother, dear. Mum. Seems like you did it. It was Mum. She helped me again. I see. But you know what... I guess my heart... has hardened like you guys. Even when she was first infected... and even now... the tears won't come. Banzai! Takeshi Hirokawa - Electoral Victory It was a long, hard campaign. But thanks to you all, he's been elected mayor! Thank you all so very much. Why the summons to HQ? Beats me. Commander. I'm Hirama from the East Fukuyama Precinct. I'm Tsuji, his deputy. I need your help to secure some information. Sign this. It's a sworn statement of secrecy. This case is strictly under the radar. And you are? Sorry. I'm Yamagishi, commanding the Special Assault Team. Special Assault? The S.A.T.? If the human population was halved, would that halve the amount of forests that get burned? If the human population fell by 99%, would that similarly reduce the amount of poison produced? That question again? Of course it would. Somewhere on earth, someone was thinking... that all life needs protecting. That's exactly right. Isn't it, Goto? A fly can fly without being taught. A spider spins a web without a lesson. All living things are simply following orders. Orders? When I took over this human brain, I too, received orders. Saying what? "Devour their entire species". Migi. What is it? I realise what I need to do. What is it? I don't care who they are. I need to track down those parasites and kill them one by one. That's the task ahead of me.
