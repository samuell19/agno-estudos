Top the inside of the deep mold with currant jelly - Currant jelly? - Yes, yes. And let it rest until the next day in a cool place. We can do it this winter! Everything will be very fresh.

Yeah, yeah, yeah! But with the cane we can make music. It's the neighbors... We exist. - What are you reading? - The cookbook. - What about? - What to serve after a soup. Madère, Xérès, Balzac or Sauternes. Madère, Xérès, Balzac or Sauternes. Mamadou, why are you reading that? - You will never drink Sauternes. - I'm interested!

The first is soup; the second, an appetizer after the soup. the third, the starters; the fourth, the roast the main dishes, the salads, the garnishes and dessert. It's noon, brother! It's time for union break! Union break! Ah, this sun! One would think that we were in Africa... Oh yeah. - So? - Yes, that will be fine.. - Mamadou. - Yes? It's Mister Volker's watch, I found it under a bench in the plaza.. - Will you give it to him? - Yes, I will take it. Quiet. Mamadou, sweep... It's better, you know? Ebony... It is very hard. I want to return to my land, to my house. Everything hurts. - Do not leave me alone. - No, no, no. I'll stay with you. Don't worry, I promise that in hospital they will take care of you and you will return to Africa. Don't worry. There's no problem. You have to go home. I saw it in his eyes. We need to get money for the trip. It will not be easy.. Yes? Come in! Good day, Monsieur Volker. - Ah, good morning. - Good morning boss. To what do I owe the pleasure? It's your watch... Bruno found it under a bench in the square. Who would have thought? It is my watch! And I lost it under a bench in the square! Ah, this Bruno! You have a good eye! Good eyes, yes. He is one of our best employees. Paris can have faith in that sweeper. Yes. Precisely, Monsieur Volker. We wanted to tell you... Bruno is not well at all. He was taken to the hospital by ambulance. I think he would like to return to Africa. But, if it's okay with you, we can fill the position between us two. - You two? - Yes sir. Boss... We are always together, we ebony folk work together. Ebony, oh how beautiful, ebony! But do you have experience as sweepers? - Yes or no? - Aye, Mr. Volker! - The carpentry of black folk, sir ... - That has nothing to do with it! You'll have to attend the school of sweepers. Each profession has its tricks! See if you have a good hand. I'll wait for you Monday at seven in the Félix Eboué square. That is where I teach. Thank you, Mr. Volker! Goodbye until Monday! Thanks boss. See you Monday. Not bad, for our first time! Each art has its tricks! If you hold the handle as God commands if you turn your torso when necessary, without contracting it you can do three broom passes per minute. Left hand up high on the handle right at knee height. Oh, yeah! Hey, you left-hander! Don't do it below the leg! Later you and I will talk. Come on, one more time! Smooth movement! There you go! That's it. For the love of God, you're going to break the handle! What's this? Can't you stand straight like a person? We aren't beating coconut trees! - Excuse me, boss. I was a little tired. - Now, now. Collecting paper is like fishing for sharks with a harpoon. It's all in the knee's bend! Come on, Bokolo! Very well! Come on! Hop! Perfect. Is this okay, boss? Bravo, Mamadou! Bravo! You will go far! With men of your calibre, Paris sanitation is secure. Bokolo and Mamadou, you start tomorrow in Montmartre. I hope I don't regret assigning you to a quiet neighborhood. Thank you, boss. Good morning, madam! It's a good day today. The sun is starting to hit! See you later! Good morning, comrades. What's up? Taking a stroll? We are all civil servants of the city hall of Paris. Same here! Do you understand, Bok? The society of obstruction this is. We take away and they put it on. - Bye, comrades. - Have a good stroll! Well there's plenty of time to whet our appetite. Hey, Bok? Let's see. Ah, the eggs! Scrambled eggs. That we do know. Yes, we already read it. Jewish style eggs ... We already read it. And the soufflé omelette? Does it ring a bell? The secret is a constant temperature. Constant temperature. And you shouldn't toast too much if not, you will have problems. To your health! In no time you will know all the recipes! And just the same, you can't make a pate sandwich. Bok, when the break is over We start by cleaning this up. The inspector does not come until a quarter past two. It's not worth it! This lemon is already squeezed. The lemon is already squeezed and the skin is already pulled. One, two, three... ...four, five, six... If you want to play, come now. Hey guys, hey! Beans are not going to pay for Bruno's journey. Well, we play the lottery. It's easy, and you can make a lot of money. Come on, I'm sure you can think of some ideas. An idea? Let's go find oil! If everyone thinks something, we're sure to get the money. Give a little coconut! At least we can bring you pineapples. They look good, and they are good. Hello, Rachel. Little Bruno is very ill. Will you give something for him? He has to go back to Africa. Hasn't he improved? They haven't given me the scholarship. I can give you 10. Thank you sister. Good luck. - Hello, Momba. - Hello. We have a problem, Momba. Bruno is very sick. He has to go back to Africa. - Can you give something for the trip? - Ah ... The only one who could find money is Pentecôte, you know? Pentecôte Séné the one who sells hats. - Maybe he can help. - Thank you. I hope the you catch the plague, Momba. The boys have nothing. Halama and his wife gave me 100 francs. Well, let's continue. Séné Bruno is very sick. Could you give money for his trip? I don't... I can't give you money. You better work ... It is not for us. It is for Bruno, who is sick. Well then! Better get to work. - I have nothing to give you. - You don't believe us! No, I believe you. I have no money, none! To work! You rascals! You have to work! What a pair. The sweepers here have there work cut out for them. Yes, they have to be good. - We come to see our friend Bruno. - Bruno what? Bruno, you know. "Yuno" with a 'y'? No, madam. Bruno, with a B. You should have said that in the first place! Mr. Bruno Gérard! Building E, zone G, stair A, floor C, room D. What was that? E for Étienne, G for Gérard, A for Anatole, C for Camille, D for Denise. It's clear, no? Remember well, Bokolo. E for Ethiopia, G for Guinea, A for Abidjan, C for Conakry, D for Dhaka. It's pretty clear, no? Very clear. Madames, Mademoiselles, Messieurs. Hello!

The sauces are the ticket. We know everything there is to know about sauces. We knew all the answers. With the sauces, we've already won. On the television? Yeah, on television? Okay, the sauces we know. But... what if they drop in some hors d'oeuvres? The hors d'oeuvres we don't have under control, Mamadou. We still have ten days, friend. I'll take care of the hors d'oeuvres myself. And you are going to study the sauces, the ragout, and the marinades. Okay, let's give it a try. With Constance Cabriolet we will win for sure! The carrots... - What? - Do not forget carrots. Do not forget carrots, onions... One of them seasoned with three cloves... - What? - One seasoned with three cloves. One of them seasoned with three cloves! The sauce for the squabs needs three hours... The sauce for the squabs, Spanish style it must simmer for three hours. Before this you have to make a reduction over high heat a sirloin steak, a quarter of pork tenderloin, and two adult partridges in a bottle of white wine. and add a cup of gelatin to it. Add a cup of gelatin, and do not forget carrots, onions, one of them spiced with cloves. Make the reduction and marinate with the juice...

Now that we are registered to participate Mamadou... we have to go! Yes! And win! We can't break down now. Desserts, meats and sauces are under control. Yes, yes, I know... But there is something that worries me. There are still eight days. Yes, but there are still words that we don't fully understand. Words like colatura, jambelette... What exactly is colatura? Do you think they will ask that? You have to consider it, that's for sure. Do you know what we need? Dictionaries. Mamadou, look up "colatura". Colatura... Let's see... Cocoon... Coffee... Coiffe... - Here it is: colatura. - And what does it mean? Colatura: filtration whose objective is to separate from a liquid the most solid elements. Filtered liquid following this procedure. That's it! I understand already! For example, a green bean colatura... The national library is on another street, yeah? I'm here to sell books. I'll distract him. You search for the words. Jambelette and Thai. Monsieur... do you have Tintin in the Congo? I don't know ... I'll go look in the back. Mamadou... The oars are already up! And it's still 11 o'clock. ... half an ounce of powdered chicle, ounce and a half of sifted sugar well undone, beat hard with a wicker whisk... What wicker whisk or what wicked kid? Ah! Caught red-handed! A little rest is fine, But don't overdo it. It's still 11! To work! - We were about to go, boss. - It's not about that! Come, each one to his zone and to his sidewalk. Bokolo, you to the right. Mamadou, you on the left. Come on, graceful! Marshall! Cooking Monograph... ha! So we have some cooks, eh? They spend all day chatting, taking things from their master... They eat rotten books over there... They must have stolen it! - I thought you had it! - And I thought you did! The antique dealer would take it. No! Surely they threw it in the trash. What happen to you? A catastrophe has occurred. A catastrophe? What catastrophe? - Bruno? - No. The TV! The contest! The award! The trip! - It's all fucked. - What's fucked? We have lost the cookbook. But hey! If you know everything by heart... The mushrooms! The ragout! The Spanish style squab! The partridge stew with sauce! Partridges yes, man. But we have no idea about the hors d'oeuvres! - Zero! - And desserts... We don't know anything. - Just the whipped cream. - But look, Mamadou. It can be fixed. Do you know where you could have lost it? Yes, more or less. Well tomorrow morning let's all look for it and we will surely find it. It's not here. I haven't seen it. And yet I'm sure it's here. There it is! Come here! - Hello! - Hello! Charmed. Hello, hello! Look, we have a problem. You usually pick up books. Have you found ours? I'm going to make you tripe with poulette sauce.

But we are not cooks, boss! - Let us explain. - There is no worthy explanation! Okay, boss. They are not cooks, but experts in cooking. They know everything about sauces! - Appetizers! - And soufflés! They are on a kind of special mission and they have been exempted from work. So they can study! In order to win the contest. Tomorrow is the big day! They are already registered to participate. Tomorrow at three, on TV. - On television? - Yes, boss. Ah! You should have said so before! Sit down, boss. - Television! - Yes, yes. The television! Yes! Yes, boss. My friend Bokolo and me. - Television! - Yes, boss, it's true.

Look at the hourglass, your last boiling egg will soon be hard. It's an absurd question! I put whatever I want in the piggy's ears! It's a matter of taste and intelligence!
