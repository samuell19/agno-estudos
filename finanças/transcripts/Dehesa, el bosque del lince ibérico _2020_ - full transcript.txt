In a time now past, most Iberian forests looked like this. Even today, in some mountain ranges in the south of the peninsula, remains of those thick jungles grow, enveloped in dense mists. But as a result of tenacious human action, of the use of livestock, a new landscape grew up. FOREST OF THE IBERIAN LYNX Spread out forests of holm oaks and cork oaks, exclusive to the Iberian peninsula, with an appearance and an activity similar to that of the African savannahs, where flocks of domestic livestock carry out the role of the great herds of wild ungulates. A unique ecosystem, the result of the sum of nature and human activity. An old contract of mutual interest, in which the forest is not harmed. And where a large community of predators search for their food. The axe, the plow and the teeth of livestock opened these forests. But the thick surrounding vegetation hides some of the most valuable species in the Mediterranean forests. An Iberian lynx, an animal whose sole presence dignifies the place where it lives. The rolling terrain of the dehesa, with soft ground, scattered trees and abundant undergrowth, is the ideal habitat for mountain rabbits. At the same time, the weight of sustaining all this ecosystem falls on them. Between raptors and earthbound carnivores, up to thirty species of predators have specialized in hunting them. Pursued, harassed on the ground and from the air, rabbits have the weapon of the humble: a high birth rate. A cavity excavated underground shelters the litters. Dry and comfortable, it is lined with grasses and the soft fur from the mother's belly. The baby rabbits, separated from the communal warren and far from prying eyes, are shut away during the day behind a door of earth. Hungry, just a few days old, the baby rabbits have to grow quickly. They will soon leave the protection of their rabbit hole. The mother, prolific, will get pregnant time and again, up to four or five times a year. More than twenty siblings will join the family. Rabbits are the basis of the dehesa. But at times it seems that the dehesa is falling down on their heads. A herd of fighting bulls move across their domain. Descendents, like all breeds of cattle, of the aurochs, these animals have been selected not for their physical characteristics, but for their aggressive, resistant behavior. Life in the herd follows a strict hierarchical order. There are constant quarrels. The dominant male scratches to intimidate the others. In their fights, these bulls only know how to charge head on, with their forehead, without duplicity or cunning. No other animal charges with such force. The collision of two enraged masses of 500 kilos shakes the dehesa to its foundations. Built as water reserves for the summer months, the pools open the forests to other inhabitants. An otter, a mammal that abandoned dry land to hunt in the water. Agile on the ground, otters have evolved for aquatic life. With their eyes and nose at the edge of their flat heads, they can look out at water level and keep their waterline low. Immersions are continuous. Capable of holding their breath for three or four minutes, they rarely dive without obtaining results. The latest rains bring good news. On the rocky slopes that surround the dehesa, new eyes open to life. Born a few weeks ago, these two Iberian lynx cubs look out on the exterior for the first time. They have just opened their eyes, still blue from lack of exposure to the sun, and curiosity leads them to the mouth of the den. But they've chosen a bad moment. Nothing bothers a cat more than a downpour. Even so, they prefer to get wet rather than go back to the darkness, and the mother moves away a few meters so that her young, feeling themselves alone, look for shelter under the rocks. The mother won't go very far. The cubs are out of sight now and at this age they are very vulnerable. At last it stops raining. The cat comes back to check on things. No one at the mouth of the den. The mother calls with a yelp and the two cubs come out again. Then there begins a ceremony of licks, games and fights: the daily ritual of any family of cats. Considered the most threatened felines on the planet, the Iberian lynxes were close to extinction. There was barely a hundred of them left, prowling freely through the woodlands. But, for once, action was taken in time, with a very efficient conservation plan over the course of several years and, as a result, new litters are increasingly frequent. The days grow longer and the sunlight turns into colors and sounds on the floor of the dehesa. In the fields of poppies, on the plains of hedge mustard, the buzzing of pollinating bees creates a vibrant background of sounds. Even on the plains, animals always look for the shortest routes. If the landscape tells a story, the marks traced on the ground by the hooves of ruminants are its lines of text. Turquoise in a world of liquid crystal. A kingfisher harpoons the waters. The kingfisher's entire body is a prolongation of its long beak. A hydrodynamic design that is perfect for diving. The kingfisher always patrols in crystalline rivers shut away between slopes and with fallen trunks from which to look down on the current. From his vantage point nothing can hide from him. "Pardillas", and other small fish fall under his viewing angle. The kingfisher can also compensate for the apparent deviation of the image underwater due to the refraction of light with absolute precision. The fine season advances and in the shadier areas the purple red of the peonies stands out against the subdued green tones of the undergrowth. The smell rather than the color of the peonies attracts pollinating beetles which, completely covered in pollen, will scatter the future of these flowers throughout the dehesa. For many species, the dehesa is only a hunting ground, a roaming area where it is easier to seek out and pursue their prey. But to breed they choose more protected places, steep slopes, inaccessible rocks. A pair of Bonelli's eagles tend to their nest. Of all the great Iberian eagles, the Bonelli's eagles are the wildest, the ones that live in the steepest places. Sedentary, they are closely linked to the most hidden ledges, where they easily find platforms that are difficult to access. Perched in his castle, the Bonelli's eagle doesn't always have to fly far to find food. From up here the call of the red-legged partridges can be heard clearly. The eagle constantly patrols his hunting territory. He is accustomed to flying close to the peaks, watching both sides. He glides down the slope, he avoids the crags. He searches for the surprise and is always ready to swoop down on any animal he catches off-guard. In this case, the partridge hasn't realized what is bearing down on it. Some of its feathers fly for the last time. On their hunting trips, these eagles show us what a good neighborhood should be. The still waters of the River Douro, boxed in between cliffs, mark a border between two countries, but not the limits of the eagle's territory. The Bonelli's eagle hunts on the Portuguese side, and every day crosses the line to feed his chicks on the Spanish side. There are no borders in nature. The black and white wingbeat of the hoopoe stands out against the floral carpet. With such wide wings, there is total wing control. Because of its morphology, the hoopoe isn't prepared for perching on a vertical trunk, so it has to make a real effort to introduce its beak, fine as a needle, into the chick's throat. On the sunnier slopes, on stirred up ground, these plants with violet flowers grow. Perhaps because of their sinuous growth, they are known as viper's bugloss. In the fields of dandelions, it isn't that flowers that present a danger. That is the function of the little crab spider, hidden by the colors of its surroundings. In this case, yellow, although it can vary depending on the floral palette. As if hidden behind a veil, the spider is invisible to its enemies. The disproportionate size of its front legs, the reason for the comparison with crabs, allows it to trap proportionately enormous prey. Functionally, the crab spider is a trap. In the sensorial world of insects, bathed by ultraviolet light, the arachnid is no more than a vague form on a field of flowers. The hunger of one and the patience of the other make the encounter inevitable. The hunter doesn't spin a web, but it cultivates patience and the technique of lying and waiting. For long hours if necessary, before the deadly embrace. The spider closes its legs over the prisoner and injects its venom. The season advances and the yellow flowers turn into thistledown, filaments that float on the slightest breath of wind. The tranquility is only apparent. The cries from the birds in the forest indicate that something is going to happen. But this rabbit seems to be the only one who hasn't realized. The hour of the lynx begins. Concealed by the patches on his fur, the lynx blends in with the chiaroscuro of the forest. A thicket of grasses comes between the hunter and his prey. There can be no visual contact, but the lynx's hearing guides him with the same precision as his sight. His figure becomes blurred, beard erect, ears pointed forward but with the crests flattened. Not a hair of the cat protrudes above the grasses. At four or five meters, the distance of a leap, the attack is deadly. For the rabbit, noise is its downfall. The rabbit's shrieks serve to warn its whole community of the danger. Too late. Everyone in the forest already knew it. Except, perhaps, the main protagonist. A cruel spectacle. Large insects and tiny rodents, all skewered, impaled like the victims of a sinister Transylvanian count. A southern grey shrike watches from a high perch. From their appearance, shrikes seem like little raptors, the featherweights among birds of prey. The hooked beak and its hunting techniques vouch to that. But there is something missing in its killing equipment: strong claws to grasp and tear. That is why they use tools such as the barbs on thorn bushes like a butcher's block. All of the shrike's life takes place among barbs. Even in the nest, hidden behind the prickly barrier of a holm oak's needles. A ladder snake scours its hunting territory. The distant cheeping of the hungry chicks betrays them. And although the ophidian's hearing isn't particularly fine, the shrike reacts in alarm. But first, a bit of silence. Given the proximity of the snake, a specific cry and something like a thump on the ground alerts the chicks so that they hide and keep quiet. Facing the danger alone, the shrike defies the snake, it exposes itself, it provokes it to distract its attention. The alarm is over. A hoarse clamor emerges from the surface of the water. The Iberian water frogs are in heat. Born exhibitionists, the males use a trick to appear more than they are. By inflating its gular sac its simple voice echoes and becomes a hoarse, broken, defiant croak. At times the confrontation ends in a fist fight. Or rather, a leg fight. A black stork wades through the shallow waters and puts an end to the argument. With its craw laden, the stork heads for its nest. Everything in the black stork is like the negative of its white relative. Very scarce, it flees humanized areas and it has adapted so faithfully to its last refuges, the Mediterranean forests, that it has become a symbol. And unlike the white stork, the black stork is evasive, almost hermit-like. Monogamous for life, the pair usually nest on river ledges. The rock face is their wall, the water, their protective moat. When feeding, the storks don't show preference for any of the chicks which, gathered in a circle, fish in the nest for the fish and frogs regurgitated by their mother. Under their armor of scales, some jeweled lizards, two males and a female, the latter with the smaller head, maintain their flirtations in the sun that warms most. But an unusual incident seems to catch their attention. Two lynx cubs play, watched by their mother. At two months, they are at the so-called fighting stage, a rebellious childhood in which fierce fights alternate with harmless games. A second family approaches. This mother is, in turn, the daughter of the first lynx. Between lynxes, it is normal for mothers and daughters to share the same breeding grounds. Not always in good harmony. Two of the cubs get into a fight, and the mothers come over to the rumpus. Fights between adults are frequent. Also between cubs. But what is unusual is this clash in which large and small fight, each on their own. From a bird's eye view, a dehesa is an excellent hunting ground. Separated trees, which allow for very fast flight, the ground covered with pasture and brushwood, where it is difficult to hide. An Spanish imperial eagle flies over its domains. The eagle's nest occupies the top of an isolated tree in the middle of the plain. They fear no one, they don't have to hide from anyone. With its craw full, an eaglet waits. We can perceive from the size of its feet the strength of the future hunter. In full daylight, when danger comes from above, a rabbit is an easy prey. But on this occasion it manages to escape. With its haughty flight the eagle has discovered another prey. A wood pigeon at a watering hole. Only one in ten attacks ends in success. The eagle communicates the good news to its mate. The imperial eagle's fortune has not always matched the grandeur of its titles. As happened with the lynx, the predator was on the verge of extinction. Another specialist in hunting rabbits, it suffered from the collapse of its main food source and also from a long campaign of poisoning in the countryside, until its population was reduced to a hundred pairs. Fortunately, today the imperial eagles reproduce in a sustainable way and their silhouettes are seen again on patrol flights through the forests of the plain. The fine season advances, temperatures rise and it's time to change clothes. On ranches and farms wool shearing begins. Sheep aren't the only ones to shed their skin at this time. In the cork oak groves, cork stripping has begun. Another great bird of prey, the short-toed snake-eagle, has just arrived on the peninsula from Africa. The axe blades squeak as they bite into the springy surface. From early on, in the cool of the morning, a band of cork workers are peeling a grove of cork oaks. When they have finished, the cork oaks will be left bare, with the trunks and main branches an intense orange color, which will soon darken. The tree now has nine years ahead of it to regenerate its cork bark, to heal its wounds. At the height of the mid-summer heat, when the mountain is a blazing oven, the short-toed snake-eagles fly over their hunting ground. A consummate expert in the capture of ophidians, this eagle has found the ideal way to transport its long, slippery prey. In the nest, on the top of a cork oak, the only chick waits for food to arrive. The short-toed snake-eagles always swallow their prey head first, in the direction of the scales. Given the chick's brief age, the most likely thing is that the father brings the food and the mother prepares it. In this kind of game of tug o' war, every precaution is necessary. The snake, which comes perfectly rolled up, emerges against the scales and could damage the craw. On occasions, these average sized eagles, which can weigh three kilos, are capable of ingesting snakes measuring up to a meter and a half. The eagle's feet reveal its specialty in hunting. Long tarsi protected from venomous bites by a thick shell of scales, and short fingers which close with all their strength on a prey with very little diameter. Meanwhile, the father continues his low level hunting flight, inch by inch, waiting to spot some elusive movement. The days of heat advance. The pasture dries up and the rivers drop, exhausted. Standing out against the yellow background, the dark silhouettes of this band of prowlers. Evening falls and a family of Egyptian mongooses, the Iberian mongooses, wake from their long midday siesta. They are believed to be descended from animals introduced by Arab colonizers, given their skill at hunting rodents and snakes. Centuries later, with global warming, it seems as if the Egyptian mongoose is returning to the arid North African territories from which it left. It is, perhaps, the herald of the bad times ahead. The whole group heads for the hunting ground. They advance together, always staying low, body elongated, ears reduced, snout pointed: a hunter designed to remain hidden. But at times they have to rise up over the horizon. And something has been discovered. Pursued by all and at all hours of the day, the rodents in the country, from running so much, have ended up opening narrow escape corridors. But the victim's escape route is also accessible to the hunter. The game goes to the mongoose. All for the family. Change of guard. The daytime inhabitants leave room for the nocturnal prowlers. A barn owl, so confident in its skills that it doesn't even hide, white against the black night. Its flapping wings make no sound. Silence is the setting where the owl hunts. Hearing is its principal sense. Its flight feathers, lined with a smooth velvet, beat noiselessly. This silent flight has the double purpose of not alerting anyone and of allowing it to hear the slightest rustle, any creak that betrays a prey. The owl, literally, sees through sounds. The strange face of nocturnal raptors is really an auricle, a surface for amplifying even the slightest murmur and directing it to the ear. And these mice are making a lot of noise. They are running, rashly, along the same galleries where the mongooses run. This time, they have managed to escape. Few animals show so clearly what their intentions are. The common scorpion wears its lethal armor. A field cricket is out of place, far from its hole in the grass. And it's on its way to its downfall. There is no possible appeal. Trapped between two pincers, the pedipalps, the cricket receives a lethal final blow that will paralyze it in seconds. In the dead of night, a long awaited event takes place. The adult beetles of the Cerambyx species break the final barrier that kept them enclosed and they look out on a new darkness. They have spent over three years inside the trunk, in galleries excavated in the wood, and their hour has finally come. Also called great capricorn beatles, in recent decades they have experienced an explosive growth and even threaten the good health of the dehesa. So this tawny owl is the best defender of the forest. A squeal comes from the insect, an alarm signal that is already late. The drilled trunk indicates both the intensity of the plague and the need for the existence of hunters like the tawny owl. Ill prepared for flight, the males move barely a few hundred meters and climb the trunks in search of females. But the encounters between them are frequent. With the predictable result. The fights last until the cold light of dawn, the first they see in their lives, puts an end to the struggle. On both sides of the border between the Iberian countries, the dehesa is a created forest, a humanized landscape built over the centuries. And they have been its main architects. The migrant merino sheep that make the double journey from north to south. Although a few are always left along the way. Via bridges and other obligatory passing places, the flocks travel, year after year, along the old seasonal migration routes. Like a flood, they look for river fords, walk through History, impose their transit rights on the new flocks. And back in the fallow lands and clearings they have helped to build, they pay their tribute. Supported by the thermal currents and the hot winds from the slope, the vultures glide over the forests in search of food. Eurasian griffon and black vultures form a network of observers that prospect the dehesa inch by inch. Someone more astute has got in ahead of them. The red fox defends its position, but the vultures, like parachutists in an invasion, arrive in waves. In this fight it has been made clear that the great vulture, a strict scavenger, is not gifted for hunting. It attacks with its fearsome beak, capable of ripping apart the toughest tissues, but its claws, open so as to alight on motionless corpses, can do nothing against a living adversary. And after the meal, wash time. The vultures gather in bathing spots hidden in the mountains, secret places that only they know. The bath, with water or sand, is essential for maintaining their plumage in good condition. Dirt and shaking displace the feathers which lose efficiency. And few birds are dirtier than vultures after rolling around when scavenging. In the bath, the birds are giant sponges that soak up dozens of liters of water. Already heavy from the food they've ingested, for hours the vultures will be incapable of taking flight. When the ablutions are finished, they move on to the stage of deparasitizing and drying. It's hard to believe, but after the vultures' bath the water still harbors life. Two dragonflies in full reproduction. In a simultaneous action, the female deposits the eggs just beneath the surface. As if propelled by a spring, an Iberian water frog attacks. Too late. It aims well, but with too much impetus. Various investigations show that amphibians' sense of sight perceives movement very well, but colors not so much. Even so, a second attempt. The spectacle attracts a varied audience. From the bank, other individuals don't miss a thing. Neither does this common buzzard. As a hunter, the buzzard's surprise factor fails. Neither of the contenders is in its environment: a frog out of the water is as clumsy as a raptor out of the wind. The days grow shorter, the temperature drops. It's the autumn red deer rut. During these days the deer abandon the protection of the thickly wooded areas and come out to the clearings. The hoarse, wild bellows of males on heat come from every corner of the forests. The females gather in herds and watch the exhibitions of the contenders. One of them aims for total control. It runs from one side to the other, it answers any challenge. The hoarse, resounding bellows echo next to the banging of those who instead of arguing loudly prefer to argue with head butts. Like a sheepdog, the stag pursues the deer who try to get away by means of an enveloping movement from the opposite side to the rest of the herd. Day after day, the tension takes its toll. The large males lose their strength, their authority is constantly questioned. The fights become worse. The horns are designed to stop attacks, to divert blows. But the contenders' necks are covered with scars. Injuries, broken horns and a single victor. Another rumbling noise travels through the dehesa, but this, like an earthquake, comes from under the ground. A combined attack from various fronts is seriously threatening these forests. Overall, and imprecisely, it receives the descriptive name of "la seca" (the dryness). We have already seen these holes in the trunks of holm oaks and cork oaks. These are the galleries excavated by the larvae of the cerambyx. Each one of them eats, on average, some 10 grams of wood a month. They spend three years here and up to forty can coincide in one trunk. Associated in normal conditions with old or weakened trees, these insects fulfill a function in the natural regeneration of the forest. But now they have become a plague, their number is increasing exponentially and as a result they weaken the trunk. But that is only a part of the problem. For the trees weakened in this way the real mortal enemy is lurking underground. Holm oaks and cork oaks suffer from the action of the fungus "Phytophthora cinnamomi”, considered one of the most destructive plant pathogens in the world. The fungus settles in the roots and prevents the absorption of water and nutrients. The thirsty plants wither, lose their leaves and end up succumbing. And all of this in the new framework created by the climate crisis, the rise in temperatures and the increasingly longer droughts, along with the compaction of the soil due to an excess stocking rate. Rather than an iliness, "la seca” is a syndrome, a silent death that seriously threatens the continuity of the dehesas in the medium term. But life goes on. The sweet aroma of this lentisk attracts wasps, which in turn draw the attention of this mantis, one of the most formidable hunters in the dehesa. Dressed to kill, the mantis follows its prey with its eyes. When stalking, the mantis act with lightning speed. The attack is instantaneous, it lasts less than a tenth of a second. Like so many other hunters, the mantis adopt a camouflage coloring. A male meets with a receptive female. A little hesitation after the landing and the courtship begins. The male soon finds the way and it all takes place with a tense tranquility. A dangerous adventure, really, because the females are cannibals. The male has made a mistake in relaxing, because she is bigger and, in addition, she needs an extra intake of food to develop the eggs. And from above, the female has won the position. So much stealth in the approach should raise suspicions. The male is on guard but waits for a new opportunity. Food and sex. Two interests that overlap brutally in one of every four encounters between mantis. After the fierce heat and the prolonged summer drought, the first rain fronts irrigate the land generously. The gullies, streams and creeks reappear. The water retraces the map of the dehesa. This is when we clearly understand the origin and significance of these forests. Dehesa comes from "defesa”, a Latin word that describes winter pasture lands reserved, "defended", for the flocks. With the ground soaked, the mushroom season opens. The spores from the mushroom caps spread the aroma of the forest through the air. The days pass, the cold is approaching and on the horizon there are signs of bad weather. It is the period of the "montanera”, when holm oaks and cork oaks throw their fruits on the ground... from where they are scooped up. With the fall of the acorn, herds of Iberian pigs will graze freely in the dehesas. This animal is a specialist in transforming acorn into meat. Each pig can eat up to 12 kilos a day, mixed with another four or five of grass. Such high productivity makes the Iberian pig one of the financial mainstays of these forests, created and maintained for the production of livestock. The days are short now and the cold is advancing. The common cranes arrive. They come from the north of Europe and as they fly over the dehesa they announce the winter. Many birds, solitary until now, gather together in great multitudes to cope better with the cold months. A vast flock of spotless starlings gather every evening. We don't know who guides them, but the orders are transmitted with the speed of an electric discharge. No one collides with anyone. In the reddish light of dusk, the cranes head for the place where they will spend the night. Deeply distrustful, they seek out a place to sleep that combines certain conditions: a wet area, a lagoon, a reservoir, or the muddy banks of a river; always separated from any danger that might prowl on dry land. The cranes are right to take refuge in the water, because in the darkness many eyes are watching. A genet travels its hunting ground. It meets with a garden dormouse. Not all dormice sleep in winter. At least not every year. The old woodland, with trunks full of holes and fallen bark, is a labyrinth for this variation on the game of cat and mouse. With different participants, the same drama is played out time and again. The game is now played between a wood rat and an eagle owl. Like the Iberian lynx, the eagle owl also breaks up the lines of its head with a couple of brushes. They are just feathers, birds don't have ears, and we have already seen how nocturnal raptors perceive sound on their facial disc. Wings full of stealth, a trail of silence disappears in the darkness. The owl has carried out its task. Without the pressure from these predators, the rats would multiply endlessly and would be a serious problem for balance in the dehesa. At dawn the cranes shake off the night. Before the sun rises, at those hours when a faint mist rises off the sheets of water, the first ones to set off drag small groups after them, in a particular direction. They won't fly very far. With the sun now warming the land and dissipating the mist, the cranes spread out over the surroundings. They explore the fields of acorns, but the oaks mature in a staggered way, so the flocks wander until they find a good feeding ground. They seek out the fruits left behind by the pigs, they peck at the ground and, in their way, also do the agricultural work necessary to keep the dehesa cleared. The cranes travel in families and, recently arrived on the peninsula, the adults, with black throats, still stay with the young, with pale grey throats and still without the characteristic red patch. Trumpetings of alarm and a discreet withdrawal. Many pairs of eyes watch the four corners of the forest. This lynx has no intention of going unnoticed. Over a century ago, the common cranes bred in small numbers in Iberia. Now they only come here to winter but, unlike the general tendency in birds, the populations of these long-legged creatures have multiplied by ten in the last half century. Again the strings of cranes mark the lines of the horizon in the sky. The Iberian lynx doesn't need to hide. His meal isn't going to escape. The members of the family gather around. A son from last spring. And his mother. The young lynx maintains a certain relationship with his father, from whom he hopes to learn the secrets of hunting. Although, on this occasion, there is little to learn. Between adults, relations are more distant. The lynxes constantly exchange olfactory signals: of defiance... or of contact and recognition between the mother and her son. The large male tolerates their presence but won't allow them to eat until he finishes. A primitive urge leads the lynx to bury the remains of the body, to mark his ownership with his smell. In general the Iberian lynx don't eat carrion. They are predators highly specialized in catching rabbits. But the viral diseases which have been decimating rabbit populations for decades force the felines to look for alternative sources of food. Sated, with the food covered, the lynx walks off, but every few inches he leaves his smell, the lynx's sign, before disappearing again into the undergrowth. He crosses the clearing calmly, he exhibits himself. In his territory he has no enemies, in natural conditions nothing threatens him. The Iberian lynx's excess of confidence came close to causing their extinction. Some high pitched shouts travel along the river. Any time of the year is good for otters to mate. Like eternal adolescents, otters play ceaselessly. Not a single drop of water wets their skin. The outer layer of fur traps the air and creates a kind of insulation, like a neoprene suit, and the inner layer is so thick that the water never gets through it. Their vision underwater is better than in the exterior. Over short distances, or at night, the whiskers or vibrissae on their snouts open up a tactile world to them. Even while playing, they continue to mark their territory. The sand smells of otter. The otter is a mustelid, a carnivore of the family of martens and weasels. A hunter modeled by water, which has smoothed its shape, stylized its profile and increased the flexibility of its muscles. The result is an animal agile on land, but which in the river moves like the waves. With their eyes, ears and muzzle on the surface they swim at periscope depth. And although they can row with their padded paws, the main impulse comes from the undulatory movements of the body and tail. Rather than swimming, otters flow. The Iberian dehesas have told us many stories. Some about struggle, others about cunning, deception and concealment. Since time immemorial, flocks and herds have come here following routes already old, to occupy the open forest that grew up from a pact between nature and human beings. But that pact is in danger now. A threat that can no longer be ignored is looming over the dehesas. Plagues and global warming could transform the extensive groves of trees into fields of scrubland or, even worse, open the gates to the advance of the desert. A landscape will exist while there are eyes to contemplate it. Meanwhile, every year the wings of the recent arrivals plow through the skies and new litters appear at the openings of lairs. It depends on us that, every time a rabbit jumps, a lynx runs after it, that the tapestry of life never weakens, and that the whisper of the wind brings us more stories that will extend, year after year, the tale of the dehesa.
