- Hey, Nancy. - Mornin', Rose. Wow, Rose. Oh, yes please. - This all looks amazing. Mmm hmm. - Thank you. Don't be bashful. - Oh, don't you worry. - So, tell me, Rose, how do you keep this place so pristine? I mean, it is spotless. - I run a pretty tight ship. - You mean you clean this place yourself? - You don't have a cleaning lady? - Well, we did back when Bruce and I were both so busy, but I just do it all myself now. - You should hire some help, dear, I mean just to save yourself the stress, right? - I don't know. I really don't mind. Gives me something to do. I wish my place looked like this. - Oh, Diane, your place looks fine. Mary does a great job. We share the same cleaning lady. - Oh. - This is sublime, Rose, mmm. - Thank you. And thank you guys for coming. It's been a rough couple of days. - I can't imagine. I mean how are you holding up, dear? - Well, I am still pretty shaken up, but I'm managing. I wish I could say the same thing for Desi though. He's a wreck. Poor boy. Oh, you poor dear. - I put in my last day at the office yesterday. I told 'em it was just time, you know. I mean, my boy needs me and I just need some time for myself. I couldn't concentrate on the work anymore. - So does this mean that you are-- - Officially retired. Well, that's exciting. - It is. I mean, I've spent my whole life working long hours. I'm just so happy to be able to make my own schedule from here forward. - Well, that is the right decision. - I think so, too. - Well, cheers to no more work and a happy retirement. - Cheers. - Cheers. Hello? Hey. - Hey. Is it okay if I stay here for a bit? - Of course. You hungry? - You went a little heavy on the sauce there. - Maybe you just put extra sauce on it. - Coulda cooked the meat a bit longer. - So how was your day? You gone back to work yet? - Quit. - Really? - Boss called today, asked if I was coming in. Told him my wife killed herself three days ago. Don't really feel like cooking overpriced eggs for rich people anymore. - Well, guess what? What? - I quit my job, too. We can be unemployed together. - You fucking with me? - Desi, please don't use that word. - For real though. I've been thinking about retiring for the past few months. I don't know, I just feel like now is the right time, you know? There's more important things to life than work. - What are you gonna do? - Well, I'm gonna have more time for myself and spend more time with my friends. Most of them don't work anymore. - Or never did. - Right. And hopefully spend more time with you. - Man, imagine all the adventures we're gonna have. - Desi, I'm so happy that you decided to come home. I didn't like the thought of you being alone. - Thanks. - Need anything? - Think I'm good. - Okay. I'm just gonna go read in bed. See you tomorrow. - Night. - Good night. She was such a sweetheart, Des, and you were so good to her. - Thanks, Mom. - Anything that you need, all right, even if you just wanna talk. - Yeah thanks. - I love you. - I love you, too, Mom. - Hank knew from the start there was something off about him. We told her to be careful with him, but... - Tell her about the shoulder. - What's that? - Last week we went over, saw this bruise on the back of her shoulder, her neck really. Asked her what happened and she just didn't say anything. She didn't need to. - We knew they were fighting. About what? He was using again. She worked so hard to get over her addiction. Yet here he was getting high right in front of her. - We told her to get out of there, come home. - She hated admitting we were right especially after we warned her about Desi from the start. - Was Jade much of a cook. - She wouldn't know a microwave from the stove. I tried to teach her a thing or two, but she just had no interest. - I think she liked having people cook for her. Maybe that's what she saw in him. He's a chef. - Right. Had she ever attempted suicide or mention the thought? - No. - Never. We know she took some missteps in her life, but she never woulda left us that abruptly. She had too big of a heart. - We on the John Doe from last night? - No, find everything we have on the Larkin case and bring it to me. - The suicide? - That's what we're going to find out. - Thought they wanted to pass over that one. - Only because they barely covered the scene. The husband, Desi Larkin, he's the one who found the body. He made the call. Jade's parents say that he was relapsing and the two were fighting constantly. - What did he say? - He's my next stop. Moved back into his parents' house, or his mother's house, Rose Larkin, Huntington Woods. - Dad not in the picture? - Died of cancer four years ago right before Desi's last stint in rehab, right before these two lovebirds met. - Where'd the report say she was before he found her? - Just taking a walk. - How's it feel? - Morning. - Morning. - So my friend April, her husband Steve, he owns Busters, you know that family restaurant over there on Lincoln. I think that you know it. Anyway, he said that they could use a new chef on the line and they'd be happy to take you for an interview today anytime before five. Ha, you're just working out a few shifts a week. April said she thought it would be a great way for you to get back on your feet again. - Well, April knows best. - Oh, she is so supportive. Anyway, I figured you could use some new clothes for the interview so. Oh, Desi. Oh you'd look so good in this. No? You like the maroon one better? Let me see, yeah. Yeah, that's a little bit more stylish. I'll tell you what. You pick, okay? - Right. Thanks. - Of course. Oh, I put some ointment on the nightstand for you. I noticed that your arm still hasn't healed. Hello? - Hi, Mrs. Larkin? - Yes. - I'm Detective Lane. I'm looking for your son Desi. Is he around? - I'm sorry, is he expecting you? - No, ma'am. I'm just here to ask him a few questions about his wife's passing. My deepest condolences by the way. - Okay. What kind of questions? I really just need to speak with your son, ma'am. Shouldn't take long. - Well, he's just getting up, but I'll see if I can get him. Come on in. - Thank you. - You can grab a seat. He'll be right down. - Oh, thank you. Hey. Desi. Detective Lane. - Yeah, hey. - Is there some place we can talk more private? So sorry about your wife, Desi. I can't imagine what you're going through. - Thanks. It's been tough. - I'm sure. So first I'd like to clear up a few things from the police report. You wanna walk me through what happened last Friday night starting at 7 p.m.? - Sure. So seven, that's about when we had dinner. - What'd you have? - Just some pasta. - You cooked? - I did. And that was typical? - Yeah, I'm a chef. Or I was a chef. I'm not working right now, but that's my field I guess. What kind of pasta? - It's a new recipe I was trying. - Did you have anything to drink with your dinner? - Just water. - No wine? Really? With pasta on a Friday night. - I don't drink anymore. Never was much of a wine drinker anyway. Gave me headaches. - What about Jade though? Did she appreciate a nice glass of wine? - She did, yeah. You could say it was her drink especially when she was shooting up. Her favorite combo. - Had she been shooting up at all recently? Last few months were getting pretty bad. - Really? Was she high that night? Were you high? - No. 3 1/2 years clean. - Congratulations. - Thanks. - Okay, so what happened next after dinner? Um so after dinner I just went for a walk. - Alone? - Just needed to get out. - Where did you go on this walk? - Just around. - For how long? - 30 minutes, maybe less, I don't know. - Okay and then what happened next? - I get back home and that's when I found her just lying there in the kitchen. - Were you surprised to find her like that? - Of course I was. My heart dropped. - Where'd you get that scratch on your arm? - Oh. I just scraped it against the counter at work. Oh God. Real stupid. - Okay. One more thing. Do you know what this is? - Looks like some kinda seed. - It's called a cholerin seed. When several of these seeds are ground, heated, and refined, a powerful poison is extracted. Even the smallest dose is enough to kill a person within minutes. This is the poison we found in your wine bottle that night. This is the poison that tests revealed was in Jade's system. Have you ever seen any of these seeds in your kitchen? - Never. - How'd it go? - Hell did you come from? - I wanted to make sure you were okay. - What, so you were listening in? You shouldn't have lied to her about your arm. What if she finds out? - She won't. - You should be telling her the truth about everything because if you don't-- - She's gonna think I murdered my wife. Yeah, I got it. So this every day now? - Well let's see, he's in Kenya right now and then off to Tanzania after that. - David spent time volunteering in Tanzania. - You know I think Theresa stopped there, too. - Bless them all. Now, how long is Jacob gonna be over there? - Well, he was supposed to be there till December, but last I heard from him it sounds like he's gonna be extending his trip by a few months. So who knows. He is having a fabulous time. We may never see our son again. - Well, it must be so rewarding. - Theresa said it was the best choice she ever made. - Well, I have a little announcement to make, too. April, you and I already talked about it, but Becca got into the graduate program at Stanford. Oh. - She's through the roof, oh. She can't believe it but I told her with that application she sent in, there was no way they'd turn her down. I mean, top 1 % of the GRE. Let's see, straight As at U of M. I mean, come on, she was a shoo-in. So she'll be studying microbiology? - Yep, getting her masters. - Oh, I remember that little girl when she couldn't even pronounce microbiology. - Well, it's not a surprise. She's such a bright girl. - Oh, thank you. - So, Rose. How is Desi doing? I mean, it must be really nice to have him home. - He's getting there, you know. I'm very glad that he made the choice to come home so I can take care of him. - So what's going on with the investigation? Renee told me he's a suspect now. - Well, it was on the news and in the papers that they're looking at him. They suspect some foul play. - Oh, no, that is nonsense. He loved her. He's so heartbroken. You know, he can't even talk about her without just breaking down. I'm just trying to do what I can do to help. - Well, let us know if you need any help, dear. - I will. Thank you. My birthday. - What, what's that? - Sunday is my 60th. Hoo, I can hardly believe that. So I was gonna make some shrimp scampi and serve some hors d'oeuvres and I would love it if you girls could come over. - Well, you had me at shrimp. - Oh well, you can bring your husbands, too. Be plenty of food to go around. - Well, that sounds wonderful, dear. - Count me in. - Great. - Well, can I help with anything? - You just come hungry. - She was bored, simple as that. I mean, just needed something to do. Can't sit still and let life happen. - Did she seem happier to you once she started using again? - Nah, man. Train was off the tracks. When she was clean, you could have a talk with her, watch her process thoughts and shit. But the last couple of months it was like having a conversation with a cat. You know, I talked to Desi, I tried to talk to Leddy and get him to cut her off but of course that didn't work. - Leddy? - Yeah, y'all know Leddy? That's where she got her fix. - Is that a first name, Leddy? - Shit, I don't even know. - Do you know where he lives? - Quartstown somewhere. I never really rode with. Not really my scene. - Right. Did she ever say anything to you that would lead you to believe she was having feelings of suicide? - Well, one day, it was one of those days she had like a real talky high thing going and she just would not shut up. And she said she didn't see a point of living off drugs. That's an addict for you. So it's hard to tell if she meant anything by it. - What about Desi though? - What about him? - Do you think he could've poisoned her, wanted her out of his way so he could concentrate on staying clean? - Man, I don't even know, I don't even know what to say to that. I mean, me and Desi always been cool. - But what does your gut tell you without thinking any harder? Do you think Desi could have done this to her? - No. I think he really loved that crazy bitch. - Morning, Mr. Larkin. - Morning, Mrs. Larkin. So when we gonna tell people? - How 'bout we just keep it our little secret? So I don't have to buy you a real ring now, right? - What's wrong with this one? - Well, I'm so glad you could make it. - Oh me, too. You girls do this every Thursday? - We never miss it. - It's lovely. - You're always welcome. - Thank you so much, April. - Of course, dear. Oh and if Desi wants to find some other time for that interview at Busters, I mean, the door is always open for him. - Oh thank you. Uh, bye, ladies. - Bye. - Thanks again. Oh shoot. - Desi shouldn't be here. I'm sorry, I mean, it's scary. It's like bringing a sex offender into the neighborhood. - Oh, it's worse than a sex offender. Sex offenders aren't murderers. - Wait, so you ladies think he actually did it. - Mark said it's all but certain. He made her dinner and poisoned her food. - Oh wow, that's terrifying, wha. - It really shouldn't be a big surprise. I mean, come on. There's always been something off about that boy. He's been in and out of rehab all his life. He's a heroin addict for Christ sakes. - April, I really wish you wouldn't have mentioned our Thursday get-togethers with Rose. She just, she makes me uncomfortable. - Mmm, you are not alone. - Well, she tries, girls. She just, she's had it rough. - She should see a therapist or something. - Mmm, and bring Desi with her. - Hey, Rose. - I forgot my phone. - Oh. Here you go. - Thank you. - Of course. - Name's Travis Leddy. Brought in on a possession charge a few years back but didn't do any time. Oh, she was texting him that day. Sounds like she may have gone over for a pickup. - Really? - Yeah. I'll send you the conversation. It was brief. - Anything else? - It's interesting. The guy was a chemical engineer out of school but dropped it all and got hard into drugs a few years back it seems. - We got an address or anything else? - That's what I'm still working on. All right, I'm Jade Larkin. I don't know my right from my left in the kitchen. If I'm gonna poison myself, I'm gonna need one of two things. Either a whole lotta research-- Or a lotta help. - But my laptop doesn't show any research on poison, cholerin seeds or anything. - Maybe you were using a different computer, library? Do I seem like a library girl to you? - Desi's laptop. - So I find some sort of detailed rundown on how to extract the poison, write it all down, prep it while Desi's at work. Sounds like a lotta work. - And we know how I feel about work. I had, what was it, three different restaurant jobs in the last year, none lasting more than a few weeks. - Think that's right. - I don't like work. If I'm going to kill myself, I'm gonna make it as simple as possible. Load up on Xanax, end of story. - Don't need any cooking skills for that. - Okay, I'm Desi. Why would I wanna kill my wife? - You're trying to stay clean. She was getting in the way. - Why not move out, send her back to rehab? - You love her. - Go on. - You know she doesn't wanna go right back into rehab. You leave her, that's what happens. - So I poison my wife to save her from going back to rehab. - You know what it's like. Two trips to rehab. How'd it feel going back that second time? - Imagine I felt like I wanted to die. - Hello? Desi? Hey. - Hey. Des. I gotta ask you something and I need you to be honest with me. - Okay. - When was the last time that you used? Hmm? Were you using with Jade? - No. - If you were, please just tell me because I can't go through this again. - I said no. - Then how come there was a syringe in your room? - What? - A syringe. What was it doing in your room? - What were you doing in my room? It is my house, Desi. - I know, I know. - Then have you been using again? - I haven't used in 3 1/2 years, Mom. - Then what was it doing in your room? - It reminds me of her. And she helped me get off even though I couldn't help her. - Well, I don't wanna see anything like that in my house ever again, okay? - Okay. - I love you, Desi. You know, but you need to be honest with me about everything. - What do you mean "everything"? - I wanna help you, protect you. - You think I'm lying about Jade, too? - No. What, I didn't say that. Hey, Desi! - Knew I couldn't do this shit! - Where are you going? Desi, Desi-- - Just stop! Whoa! - Yeah, man. What you got going on? - Blast from the motherfucking past. - Good to see you, man. - You, too, man. Shit, sorry about your girl, yo. - Thanks, man. Yeah appreciate it. - Yo, come on in. You doing all right? - Yeah. I'm holding up. How 'bout you? - You know, same old, just trying to survive. Shit, he's got a full boat. - Come on, man. - What's up, man? - Hey, I'm Kim. - Desi. - Yeah, I've known this kid since like before I could even hold a blunt, y'all. What's that, in preschool? - Yeah, good one. No, I think I sold you your first G, right? - Yeah, pretty sure that was just some pencil shavings or some shit. - Sounds like JD. - Yeah, you probably right. Load ya up? - Yeah, for sure. - My niggot. You hear about Dougie? - What about him? - He got laid off from the Tattoo Spot about a few weeks ago. Caught him stealing from the register, fucking dumb fuck. - No shit? - Yeah, man. Think they felt bad for him. Poor bastard, they just told him not to come back. - Here you go, man. - Probably gonna need this, too. Thanks. - Enjoy the ride. It's some good shit. Best in town. Desi, Desi. Des. The detective is here. She has a warrant to search the house. She wants to take a look at your room. - Oh, and can we also get a quick hair sample? - What for? - You said you haven't used in over three years. We just wanna make sure the story checks out. - You got a warrant for that, too? - I don't. I can't force you, but it's in your best interest if you have nothing to hide. - Sure. - Thank you. - Des. Desi, it's time to wake up. Desi. I think you should wake up. It's almost one, sweetie. I think that you should get up. I made some breakfast for you. So where were you last night? - Out. - Out where? - Just out. - Is that drug test gonna come up positive, Desi? - Nope. - Because if she finds out you're lying about being clean for the last three years, she's gonna think you may be lying about other things, too. - It's not a lie. - Even after last night? - Yeah. Just went out with some friends. That okay? - Hey. Desi! - Fuck! - What's the point, man? What the fuck are we doing here? - So I'm thinking white marble countertops and black cabinets would look so much more modern. I just think granite came and went, don't you? - Hmm, yeah. - What's going on? - Nancy's helping me remodel the kitchen. - What for? Looks fine to me. - Well, I-- - Well, you just want something to spend money on. - Desi. - I think it's gonna look really nice. - Oh, so that's who it's for, your friends. - No, Desi, it's for me. I think it's important to feel inspired in your own kitchen. - Gotta be a cheaper way to feel inspired. Kitchen work costs thousands. - It's worth it to me, Desi. - Um, I think I better go. Oh, no, no, Nancy, don't. - No, it's okay, it's fine. I'll see you tomorrow. Okay. - Peace, Nance. - So what did you do today? - Nothin'. - Did you think any more about Busters? April said you could stop by there anytime for an interview. - Fuck Busters. - Well, what are you gonna do, Desi? I mean, I think it would be really helpful if you had a job, give you structure again. - You know, I don't think I'm ever gonna work again. I think I'm just gonna live with you the rest of my life. How's that sound? - Very funny. - As long as you can live with remodeling your kitchen only once every decade. - You know, I had this dream a few nights ago-- - Hooray. You owned your own place. It was this Italian restaurant and you served me and my friends at a table in the kitchen. It was a beautiful pasta. It looked like it came straight out of the restaurant in Rome, hmm. - Some kinda dream. - You can do it, Desi. You know, you just need to put in more time. Just work harder. Why don't you just take some business classes on the side? I'll pay for it. - That's okay. You know school's not really my thing anyway. - You liked culinary school. - That was barely even school. - Well, you might like business school, too. I mean, you'll never know unless you try. - No. I know. Hmm. - Not seeing anything we like on the laptop scans. Nothing on the seeds or anything on poison. Lots of recipes and cooking articles but nothing that really struck me. Oh, I sent you the report on all the cholerin seed cash purchases in the area in the last two weeks. You see it? - I did but I have a question though. - Sure. - What are all these yellow ones? - The ones without surveillance cameras. - Great. - Hey, Rose. - Hey. Do you think I could borrow those serving trays from you? - Oh, of course, just a second. - Here you go. - Thanks so much. So I'll see you at seven? - Um, you know, actually, I'm not feeling too well. Bill's under the weather, too, so I think we're gonna stay in tonight. - Oh. - I'm sorry but I hope you guys have a great time. - Okay. Thanks. - Sure. And let me know if there's anything you need, Rose. Happy Birthday. - Thank you. - Okay, okay. Asparagus. Seams straight. Okay, so gotta line this up. - How's it coming? Hey. - Shrimp scampi, huh? - Yeah, yeah, shrimp's defrosting there. - So. How many people we expecting? - Uh, should have four. Was supposed to be six but, you know, some last-minute cancellations. - Well, four's a nice number. Don't have to prepare as much. I just, you know, I want everyone to have a good time. - Why? It's your night. I mean, look, Mom, you shouldn't even be working like this. - No, no, no, please. - Here, let me do this all right, Mom. - Oh please, please. I need something to keep me busy. I got it, thank you. All right. - Hi, come on in. - Let me see. - Oh, thank you. Oh, you shouldn't have done that. - Oh, well now. - Come on in and welcome. - Hey, good to see you. - Muah, muah. - Oh, that's true. - So, Rose, any plans for tomorrow morning? I mean it is your first full day of your 60s. Please don't even say that. - Well, if you're free, Nancy and I are going shopping at Bradford's. They have their new fall line. I heard it is wonderful. - Bradford's is always just more of the same. - No, no, no. I'd love to. I always enjoy their catalogs. Sorry. - Don't apologize. She doesn't like anything out there. I mean, she is so hard to shop with. - Oh yes, it's true, it's true. - Well, dig in, everyone. - Oh, Rose, would you like me to make a plate for you? - Oh, that would be great. Thanks. - You're welcome. - Oh my God, this is amazing. - Great. Well, Desi took charge of the shrimp so you can thank him for that. - Desi cooked the shrimp? - Yeah, he did pretty much everything. He's got the magic touch. - So were you in the kitchen with him, sweetie? Did you help him? - Oh of course. But I only pretty much watched for everything. - So you did watch. - Yeah, I did. Why? - They think I poisoned them just like I poisoned my wife. - Desi! - No, no, no. - No, no, no, that's not true. We were just curious. - Sure, always good to know if you're being poisoned. - Can we just pass, please. - Well, Desi, everything looks great. You should go to culinary school, make a career of it. - You know, that's a great idea there, Mike. - Desi. Actually, Michael, he did go to culinary school. He went to CIM. - What's that? - The Culinary Institute in Muskegon. It's a wonderful school. - Great. - It's basically the Harvard of the Midwest. - Desi, Robert is going to be in town next weekend. You remember Robert, don't you, Desi. - Your son, Robert? Of course I do. What do you think I got like shock therapy or something? - Desi! - It's okay. We hardly remember him ourselves. I mean, he's barely here. Anyway, he's starting a new company and it makes apps for phones and they have raised a ton of funds, right? - Half a million dollars. - Yeah. - Wow. - Oh wonderful. - Right, yeah. - Wow. - He's so excited. In fact, they're gonna be hiring soon and I could see if he needs some help. - Well, what, for me? - Well, I know it's not exactly your line of work. - Yeah, not exactly. - Well but-- - But you'd love to see me work for your poster child son, right? - Desi! April is just trying to help. - Yeah, Desi, I was just trying to help. - You're trying to help yourself feel good about reaching a hand out to your friend's druggie son. - Desi! - No, he-- - It's just an idea, Desi. - Oh sorry, Steve. And sorry I couldn't join the Busters crew. You guys still serving those soggy fries and frozen meat patties? - Business is fine. You know, it's too bad you're so far above us. We could've used you on the team. - You know, April was telling me about this great book that she read last week. What was it called again, dear? - Oh, um... - Yeah? - Hi, I'm looking for Leddy. Is he here? - Yo, Leddy. You got a visitor, man. I'm not deaf, motherfucker. Send 'em in. - All right. Thanks, man. - You Leddy? - Don't worry, I got a license for it. - For selling weed outta your house? - It's 2017, lady, loosen up. We'll be selling weed out of liquor stores soon enough. - Well, they aren't yet. - Why don't you get to the questions? Figure this ain't a drug bust. - What do you think this is? - Jade Larkin was over here the day she kicked it. Figured someone like you would come through see if I knew a thing or two. - Do you? - I figure you're best off looking at that hubby of hers. She bitched about him every time she was in here. - About what exactly? - Ah about how much he worked, how he thought he was better than her for not getting high, shit like that. - Was she a good customer? - Good as any. - You're a wine drinker? - Look like I got a pair of tits and a Gucci purse? - Listen, pal, this may be funny to you, but as far as we know, you were the second-to-last person to see Jade Larkin alive. Don't leave town because if you do, we'll have a warrant out for your arrest before you could reach state lines. - Second-to-last person. I hear that right? - Yeah, and? - If I was you, I'd focus on the last person. They teach you that in Cops 101 or were you too busy sleeping with the professor? Nighty night. Hey, Rose. - Hey. - Hope you had fun last night. - Yeah, it was fun. What are you doing? - Oh, just enjoying the day. - Oh. - Hope you have a good workout. - Thanks. - Thanks for having me, man. Got anything going on tonight? - Nothin', just chilling a couple hours before work. - I'm good, man. - Ah shit, right, my bad, yo. - Yeah, no problem. - Yo, try and get in? - Sure. - What are you doing for work these days? - Nothin'. - I can get you down at the Pizza Spot if you feel like delivering, cooking pies or something. That might be all right. Could use a job where I could just go on autopilot. - Right, I feel ya on that. It's the only kinda work I can do these days. Like, my boss tells me to use my brain. I'm like, bitch, my brain's for my time. - It's been like four years where I didn't chill with anyone, man. Ain't that sad? - Nah, man, people suck. Sounds pretty good to me. - I had to stay clean, man. For me, for my mom. But it's tough, man, you know. Like seeing other people get high, it's so hard for me not to wanna join in. Like, I need it to feel comfortable around people. You get that? - Yeah, man, I feel ya. Like, you can chill here any time you want whether or not you're getting high. Just don't come here with any of them speeches about quitting weed or getting off spike or any of that shit. Fucking, I can't imagine a life straight, man. Sounds like a nightmare. - Sure man, thanks. - He's the kind of guy who would kill a person just for kicks, like a drug rush. - Why Jade though? - He knew we'd look to Desi. Broken marriage, constant fighting. Leddy would be just an afterthought, a footnote. - How would he have done it, you know, get the wine to Jade? - If he knew she was a wine drinker, he could've just given her the bottle as a gift or something. - Where's the fingerprints? - Well, he could've handled it with gloves on while he prepared the poison. Wouldn't be hard to do if you plan it out and don't wanna get caught. - True. - So where are we at here? - This is Florence Gardens. Cholerin seed purchase at 11:15 a.m. on the third. Just a few more places after this one. - Wait, go back. - Huh? - Rewind five seconds. Stop. - Holy shit! - Desi. - Hey. - Hey. - Hungry? - Sure. - Great, have a seat. - Listen, about your birthday. I'm sorry. - That's all right. I don't think parties are your thing. - Yeah, you got that right. Thanks. - Sure. - You already eat? - I'm not really hungry yet. I had a late lunch. - You okay? - She was free falling. - What? - And she just dragged you down with her. Who? - I can't take it again, Desi, I just can't. Take what? Another one of your drug cycles. I mean, they tear me apart. The drug cycles. What? I not-- - What is that? - I thought that with Jade gone that you would have a chance to be clean again. You know you were doing so much better before she started using. And I just thought... - No. - Trying to help-- - By killing her? - You didn't love her. - What did you do? She used you. She abused you just like your drugs and I couldn't take it anymore. - Please, please, oh. - God help me. - I love you. 9-1-1, what's your emergency? - It's my son. - We got her? - Thanks for being here for me, girls. Sure, dear. But you really should eat something, okay? - Okay. Oh, could you get that, Nance? - Of course. - Thank you. You know, I thought he was getting better. I thought I could save him. - Some people are just beyond saving. - He told me that he was so happy to be back home. - Rose. - Yeah? - It's a detective. She said she wants to speak with you. - Oh, no, no. No, not now. Could you just tell her to come back tomorrow or just give me a call? Sure. - Oh. - What do you think she wanted, dear? - I don't know. It's very rude of her to come over here at a time like this, don't you think? I mean, she should have a little respect. I agree, very disrespectful. - Yeah. - Oh. - Rose. - Rose, it's time for your guests to leave. - You have some nerve coming over here this evening. You know very well that my son just took his own life. - Don't make this harder than it has to be. - What? - You're under arrest for the murder of Desi and Jade Larkin. What? - What? This is insanity. - Excuse me, ma'am. - I can't believe it. Think I'm gonna be sick. Please put your hands behind your back. Oh. - You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. - On what grounds is this happening? Is this pure speculation? - Trust me, ma'am, it's not. - Stay as long as you like, ladies. I'll be right back, I'm sure of it. - It's one hell of an act, Rose. - You don't know a thing about me, Detective, what I've gone through. Ladies, it was so nice being with you here tonight. Thank you. Wait. April. - Rose. - Just a moment. - Yes, dear. - Am I a good host? - Of course, dear. You're a fantastic host. - You really are. - We love dining with you. - All right, let's go. - You're a fantastic host.
