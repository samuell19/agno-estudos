CESAR AND ROSALIE You're still crazy. It's beautiful. It's Japanese? I brought you money, too. - Why? - It's what I owed you. Great, I can use it. How was New York? When did you get back? Three months ago, then I left, but I'm back. Rosalie's mother? With the family? Her mother's remarrying. I know. I got an invitation. Going? Yes. And you? I don't think so. I missed you. How long's it been? 5 years? I didn't think you'd come back. Here I am. Are you and Rosalie seeing each other since the divorce? Yes, when we want to. There's our little girl. We never hated each other. We just weren't in love. She married me because you left. Staying in France? What about her? Did she remarry? Rosalie? No. She lives with a guy in the scrap metal business... but big business. He scraps cars, boats and subways! So we're saying three lots from section 4, right? And then these two? The same prices. No sense jacking them up, they go up anyway. Capacity? 20 tons an hour. Cesar! Telephone. - Who? - Rosalie. Gentlemen, it's a deal. I'll send my brother over. - Wrap it up. It's a deal. - On the books? One third. Get cash. No check. And be smooth. If you have drinks, you pay! Albert! Hello! Yes, darling! No, I'm dressed and ready. What? I'm picking him up? No, you didn't tell me, but it doesn't matter. I'll go. What? My black tie, black shoes, like you told me. My brothers go right to the City Hall? All right. Yes. Me too. Be right there! OK, City Hall! Marcel will bring the Packard. Hurry up! Are you guys all dressed? Button your coat! Jerome, we'll pick up the groom. Albert, take the Buick. Let's go! What'd you shave with? Did the copper get here? Well, call Holland! Do you know my friend Fantin? Mr Fantin, my brother Jerome. So... you're witness, Mr Fantin? Yes, like you! And you, Henri... scared, I hope! He's the fourth... he should be scared. No, the third. Rosalie and Carla's father, Dr Guérin... - And you! - And me! Cut it out, Simon, or you'll get it. Louise, don't talk like that! - Carla! - Cesar! The pillow... Are you crazy? Can't you knock? - It's me! - So it's you. And just who are you? My dress! You know the time? I was about to ask. 11h45, and the wedding's at noon. When did you get up? Oh, the flowers! I forgot. Please the florist on rue Corot... hurry, please! The guests sent plenty... and they're free. No, the bride's flowers. It's a bouquet, you know. - Now hurry! - Kiss me. Catherine... What do I see there? I'll carry you off deep into the forest! David? She didn't tell you? Mother? Why didn't you say David was coming? I did tell you. You did not! So, I didn't. Appearing here before us today are Henri Marrieu, tax inspector, born March 29, 1915, at Versailles, son of Georges Marrieu and Marie-Antoinette Capet, both deceased, and Lucie Artigues, no profession, born in Vienna, Austria, September 10, 1920, daughter of Frederick Artigues and Gertrude Grept, both deceased, and divorced from Louis-Edgar Jamet and François Guérin. Henri Marrieu, do you take as your wife Madame Lucie Artigues? - Hello, David! - Hello, Marité! You were late! Oh, I hardly know him anymore! - So you're in France? - As you see. Let's go, newlyweds! Let's go! You remember Michel? It's raining! Umbrellas are in the car! Smile! Louise and the uncle, with Albert. Where's Marcel? - Know the way? - I'll follow. He'll follow. You draw comic strips? - Yes, as I told you. - Don't shout! - How old are you, Marité? - Almost twenty. Eighteen. So I said to him: Mr Bacchino, by the time you get the call, I'll have the 10,000 marks. Bacchino's face... - Not bad, eh? - Not bad. Oh, pretty stockings! - He's a great guy. - A self-made man. You're not passing him? He won't like that. - What? - Nothing. Go on, after the bikes. He speeds up when we get close. Too bad... You know the way? He didn't see the speed sign! I wish there was a cop. Lucky I've got good reflexes. Lucky we're lucky! You could have killed 7 people! Are you drunk? - Let me tell you calmly... - Don't tell me anything! It's all right! It's all right! It's all right! He was in the middle of the road. So I say to myself, I pull in, the kids are dead... so jerk left, controlled skid off the bank, and it's out we go! But you've got to be very good... A bit more... Pow! Into the tree! He's good... It almost wasn't funny. OK, I was wrong, but the other guy must be crazy to drive that fast! What happened? What happened? Nothing! Calm down! He was coming right at me. If I pull in, the kids are dead... It's no big deal... What's with this damn dog? Are we gonna stick around here for ever? What the hell are you doing? There. Out! What is this? You look great now! I'm really ashamed of you! A Boeing! Landing in Orly... Isn't that my Bach? That's my Bach! Like this... Double time... Does he know many? No. Just that one. He learned it by heart. What for? For me. You have a wife? Any children? I have nothing... Just my work. I know. I hear you're well known. Do you know me? Not any more. She is what's beautiful. My daughter? Yes. We two have been through a lot... Can you give Aunt Sylvia a lot... I hate to bother you... Oh, no. Get Jerome's keys, I can't drive the other car. Don't look at me that way! Coming! - How's it going? - Fine. Are you... Are you a cousin? Whose? Well... the family's. Rosalie's. I thought you were. There are so many of them. Where is she? She left with a woman. - What was she telling you? - Who? Rosalie. You were talking. I'll tell you the truth, Cesar. I love Rosalie. That's normal. Everyone loves her. No, but... - Are you serious? - Yes. Since when? Since... Always. Always! What do you mean, always? Before you. Before Antoine. That's too bad. Anyway, it's good you said it. Very good. Very good. Well Cesar, aren't you dancing with me? I'm on my way! Well, I've got to do. I have to work. That damn blue is still wrong. Finish up, I've got to go to see Georges. Not bad! Tired? Couldn't you cancel your poker? Impossible! Go to sleep. I was good, wasn't I... all day? You were marvelous. Throw out your cigar. I throw out my cigar... I am marvelous. That guy... He's nice, huh? "Guy?" I don't know any "guy". I can't remember his name... what is it... Daniel? Dany? David! That's it. Very nice. Maybe a bit too aware of it... A bit of a... You know what I mean. - You know, a bit... - A bit what? A bit... an easy-going guy... Just like you. It's called "charm". That's the word I wanted. Exactly what went on between you two? Nothing... Everything... Nothing... Don't give me that! It's either everything or nothing! I ask a question, you answer. That's life! In any case, I don't give a damn. If you don't give a damn, why yell? I'm just asking you. I knew him when I knew Antoine. He let me marry Antoine. At least, that's what I think. That's all. How did you feel, seeing him? Very good. He's nice. I wouldn't mind taking a punch at him! You are a "guy", but a bad guy, let me tell you! A bad guy... - Fix us some eggs? - I'll open some cans... Please. - Pass. - I'll raise you. Card. Out. - 100. - Out. Full house! - Drinks anyone? - A beer for me! Please, bring a beer. Two... Three... And a vodka. Give me card. You're really hot today! Darling, bring us some ice too. - What was it? - Three aces. Not like you! That's how it is. I'm out. What a pain in the ass. Can't you hear me? Emmanuel died in a crash. No kidding! But who's Emmanuel? You know, the boy who... Carla wanted to leave her husband for him. Oh, shit! When? This morning. Didn't you tell me he was a little creep? But I just said... Oh, what does it matter? I only met him once at Orly. Poor guy... Will you get us the ice? I'll get it. Funny, in two months she'll be laughing. All forgotten. You should tell her that. Mad at me? - Full house. - Unbelievable! Any ice left? No more ice. Let's play another hour. Just a few hands... I'm tired. He beat me straight: a full house! Not bad! Full house over a straight. Hold the check a few days. Don't worry. Thank Rosalie. Excuse her. She's asleep. So long. Who's this? Marité? Cesar. Is Rosalie there? No? Oh well... Yes, I know about Carla. What can you do? So, Rosalie isn't there? No. OK, thanks. Goodbye. Marité, it's me again. Listen, I just remembered tomorrow, Rosalie has to come translate for me at 9:00. It's very important. I thought she might be with those friends of yours. You know, the boys with the yellow car. That's it. What's his address? Not the phone, his address! Please. I'll wait, thanks. In a hurry? Drive over the top! - I came to see you. - What about? I'm looking for Rosalie. Because she has... She has my keys. Haven't seen her. Come up for a drink. I'd like to, but I don't have time. He's a friend. I work with him. Well, if you're not coming up, could you pull up a little. Hey you lazy clowns! You brought that jerk! Did you see the layout? Your nose is yellow. So show me. Look. Give me your pen. Bring the photo down to here. See, the title can go all the way across, and the drawing there. Whatever you say. Because like that... You're here. I just saw Cesar. He's looking for you. I'm sure he is. I'm glad you came. You know everyone? Except him. Georges, come say hello, nicely. Just introduce me. - No. No way. - Shit! Idiot! Don't rip it up! It's great! 240 lbs but no humor. You'll get yours! Show Georges the Underwood strip. Do you have time? Sure, on one condition. Can you fix coffee? What manners! You peasant! No, he's right. For everyone? - Where is it? - The door back there. Coffee's on the table. The other door. What a mess! You can't put anything down! The pot on the sugar, the sugar ready to fall... Graceful as ever... Serious? Just the maid. Go work, please, you're in my way. I'll bring it. OK. But I want it left spotless. Nothing lying around. I hear the wedding went well. Very well. You're alone? How's Rosalie? Coming to Albert's birthday? I don't know... Yes, maybe. Give me a beer. Something to eat? Yes. Whatever you have. Have the kitchen fix a plate. I'm telling you, it's in the letter. How are you? And you? Fine. Problems? Oh, nothing special. Nicole is sad. Yes, she was always moody. That's true, in a way. Well, I don't know, but... Want something to eat? She's more your type. More than who? I don't know, I've always liked your girls. But Nicole, she was... always there, no scenes, never said a word. But the other one... - I understand why, but... - Marcel, I'd like it if you didn't say "the other one". You don't know anything. So just shut up! As long as we're on the subject... He didn't get it. Come on, drop it. That's not comfortable. - Don't you want a chair? - No, I'm fine. Where do I drop you? At Cesar's? No, home. To be with my daughter. - Ever sleep at Cesar's? - Yes. Why don't we live together? Let's live together. You're incredible... or absolutely crazy. Not at all. I'm serious. You disappear for 5 years, come back, and expect me to leave everything? You're not the only one! Do you love him? Yes, I do. He's here, he exists. If he lost me, he'd go around the world to bring me back. And it wouldn't take 5 years. If I lived with you, I'd go after you too. So what? I left, you've lived, so have I. I come back and you blow up. Shit! Kiss me. She's there, isn't she? Don't play dumb! Cesar, what's wrong? You're crazy! Stop it, Cesar! Right, you don't know each other. This is Cesar. - Coline? - Exactly. You want to look upstairs? - She isn't here? - No. - What's up? - I was playing poker... I didn't do anything. Then she was gone. - She's angry? - She isn't anywhere. I hoped she'd come here, like she did that other time. Well... I'll go now. Not like that. Have some coffee. Coline, make us an omelette. A big one, ok? Maybe you scare her. She's out walking. She'll be back. Walking... I don't scare her. I'm tough, that's all. Call her, maybe she's back. No, I just called on the way. They'll double. I think we can get more. Try. It'd be good. Dear, don't do that. Will Cesar pay the transportation? Do you know that guy I met at the wedding? David? David? Yes, of course. Anyway, she's not at his place. Remember her childhood summer house? Maybe I should buy it for her. Good idea, huh? How's your work? That's very good. Really, it's very happy. It's... I'm no expert... I don't know, I find it very alive. It's... relaxing. What are you doing here? I looked for you all over. I was at David's. But I saw him last night. I know. I was upstairs. He didn't know. I saw Wilkinsen this morning. The copper? You went? It's a deal. They wanted it by weight. I said we'd sell by the piece. What did they say? We agreed on 2 1/2 times the price by weight. Good. Did you sleep with him? What's that? Marianne asked me to do her apartment up. - Will she pay you? - Of course. If you go broke, I can support you. What's that? I went to Antoine's, looking for you. A painting? It's pretty. That's really him. 30,000. I gave him 30,000 francs. He was delighted. Poor guy. - But Cesar... - What? Nothing. - Was I wrong? - No, but... You either pay Antoine nothing or much more. Understand? He didn't tell me. Of course he didn't. Of course, it's much more. How stupid? What? 150,000 or 200,000? Address an envelope, I'll send a check. I'm no expert. 200,000. If he sells five of them in a month, he's a millionaire! Tired? You didn't sleep at all? You chose to drink at Madeleine's. I'll run you a bath. What does he do again? I told you. Comic strips. Ah yes... Comics. Well, another painter. No, it's not bad. Not bad at all. He's good at what he does. I'm not going to start painting too! Where are you going? Take Catherine to the doctor's. What did he say? When will he be back? Good, I'll call him tomorrow. Thanks. Bye. - Who was that? - Marité. David called. - So? - Nothing. Are you ready? Look at your nose! That bastard better stop bothering me. Really, what do you see in him? He's handsome? So am I, in my way. And looks, as you say... Don't mean a thing. We agree. So... intelligent? He's no Proust, forgive me. I forgive you. I like it here. I'll buy it, if you like. And the bar, the florist, the whole street. I don't do little drawings. I make money. Money! Very chic. Do that again! Some butter, please. Anyway, I'll never know the truth. But Cesar... you know the truth. You see it. We're together. I'd be with him if I wanted to. I'm free. Don't tell me you don't think about him. You keep talking about him. Besides, yes... I do think of him. I don't know if he's handsome... I don't care. I don't know why I love you... But you love me. It seems to bother you. What are you doing? Going through some papers. We're going to Epernay tomorrow. I know. I'll do what you want. I'll stop seeing him. I'll stop seeing him. Don't you believe me? - Am I intruding? - Not at all. I was passing by... I thought: I'll go see David. I went up, a girl said you were here. She's pretty cute! Bravo. Bravo, anyway. Coffee for me too. Coffee, please! Because... we have to talk. Coming up later? No, drink your coffee. - He can stay, can't he? - Sure. I want to talk about Rosalie. I was going to write, and I said: no. I'll see him, we'll talk it over. We're human beings, right? It's very simple. We'll be three sad people. Me, because I love her, she's mine. I won't push that point. You, because you'll suffer. Sure, you're getting ideas, imagining God knows what... And Rosalie. She'll be torn apart. That's all. But if she loves you... She loves me, true, but... to quote my father, "Love doesn't blind a woman". You're a pretty cool guy. Oh yes you are. But you don't know Rosalie. The girl she was, yes. Not the woman she is. That's it. And this woman has found her way. And along that way, of course are men, money, life. Anyway... we're getting married. When? Any day now. As soon as the papers are ready. My coffee? Maybe she didn't tell you, but... she's pregnant. So, I'm telling you. To each his own. Right, Michel? See? I sacrificed everything for her. Everything. I have no regrets. I've stopped at nothing. At nothing. I even... killed a guy. A stupid move. You don't want the story of my life. What do I owe? I'm glad we talked. I do hate hypocrisy. Hi! There's no one up there. What's going on? Did you swallow your toothbrush? What's with him? Ready? How far is it to Epernay? I don't know. I never go to Epernay. Seen my shoes? No, but I see them now. 27,000. You should have left the price on. Do they look bad? Yellow shoes with a blue suit? I don't have time to go back home. So go like that. What are you doing? I have a pair in the car. As for these five, they're practically new. Look. I was going to say, you can see the chrome. If they're new, why are you selling them? Whole new policy. No more steam, that's finished. I just buy and I don't ask questions. If I don't find any buyers, I break'em for copper. Let's see the Diesels. Don't you want to eat now? Aren't you hungry? Good, let's go. Be nice, take care of young Rizzo. He's in my way. I'd rather work on the others. Follow me, gentlemen. Hungry? What year are they? '68. Certified? Absolutely. On the floor, grey marble. But am I boring you? No, not at all. At the end, a fireplace. A black stone fireplace. A native stone. Fragile as glass. Not even the servants can touch it. In the hallway, seven doors. Huge windows, as in the Pitti Palace. Excuse me. I see someone. Be right back. How did you find me? Cesar's office gave me the phone here and I came. But why? So, you're getting married? And you're pregnant? What? Who invented that story? Who told you that? When? This morning? You're really too stupid. I'm going back with David. Don't "kill" too many guys for me. That does it! I know. That's why I'm going. Going? What do you mean, "going"? I'm going to David's. It won't be as bad. Not as bad? What did I do to you? What you shouldn't have. Since he got back, you've been acting crazy. Me too. Don't do this. I'm doing it. Don't do it! I don't belong to you. You didn't buy me! You have no rights over me! No one does! No one! You're staying here! Put that away. Put that knife away. I scared you, huh? Go on! Get the hell out! Out! May I phone, please? I warned you, little bastard! Leave us alone and stay home! Well I am home. You little bastard! Go to hell! He was crazy. He said he was armed, ready to kill everybody. I took off and left him. I couldn't have known he'd go up. Michel called me at Georges's. I don't know how he got in. I arrived as he was leaving. At first, I thought... Everything's a wreck. The layouts, Lorca's series, all the film on my table. And he almost set the place on fire. And the Sem drawings... Oh shit! The originals Georges's parents had lent us. Look at that. What now? You're not insured, are you? The keys, please. I'll bring them back. I'm listening. 5 left, 4 center, 3 right. No... yes, 3 right. - Which is it? - Wait. Start again, I don't remember. It's 5 - 4 - 3. 5 left, 4 center, 3 right. That's it. How much? One million. That should do it. S.E.T.E. Sete. It's not a little port... It's a real port! As far as your uncle is concerned, who am I? My wife. It's a tiny café. It only serves lunch. No dinners, even. He isn't even my uncle. You've got mail. Estimate of damage Let's say one million. We took it from the safe, so as not to disturb you. A million. It's no joke. Where are they? Is she gone? Good. Expensive, but it's worth it. Give me a hand! Table 3, there. The red wine is sour. - It's the 3rd one! - The chef said it. I got lobsters and 20 pounds of fish. Good. - When does Catherine get here? - Saturday. - Are you happy? - Yes. I missed her, you know. And Cesar? - What about him? - Do you think of him? Every day, it's normal. - Do you miss him? - No. He's someone you think of with pleasure... But no, I don't. - Did you call Michel back? - Yes. Did they like the sketches? They think the last ones are very funny. Shit! You're distracting me. We're happy. I want to live a long time. A very long time. As long as my children do. Your children, do you have others? No, but I'd like to have others. Lots of them. - When do I see the boats? - You saw them. - I want to go on one. - Tomorrow. Now go to sleep. Leave the light on. - Don't close the door. - If you like. - What'll you have? - Same thing. Not many people. Now it's quiet. They come late for drinks. Do you know a friend of mine, David? I should say so. He's swimming with his wife. He'll be here tonight. You know which beach? Usually, they go... See the coast road? Towards Béziers. Here. He probably thinks I'm a gangster. You know I wasn't myself. I went crazy. I realized that. Anyway... What a place! The weather in Paris is awful. You ok? I'm beat. I drove all night. And hungry! Seen the car? I changed cars. No more of those big monsters. How did you find us? Michel? Oh, did he tell you about the studio? Right, I asked him... Well, it's all fixed. I said I'd tell you myself. So, it's all back in shape. The paintings, everything. Oh, and that guy's drawings - what's his name - Georges. I paid him. Those things cost a fortune. Look who's there! You're all hot. She's hot, isn't she? Come here. Come, get your hat. So the café owner back there, he's your uncle? He knows everything. He seems like... a nice guy. Thirsty? Good question. As I was saying, Paris is awful. We've been very busy, no time to turn around. I brought you something to translate. As usual, I can't make it out. Where did I put it? Ah, there. No, that's... Recognize the house? That's where we spent our summers when we were her age. Where is it? In Vendée. I bought it. It has room for the whole family and friends. It's a big house, must be ten rooms. But it's funny, from outside it looks small, and then you go in and it's a small Versailles! But really, it's beautiful, it's... To joust you have to stand with their feet behind. Between here and here, exactly center: ten past ten! It's all a matter of balance. Take cranes, for example. A crane, if it's off balance, the least little breeze, and it crashes. Catherine runs, I walk along the beaches. It's a house we'd forgotten. Carla remembers the color of the shutters... I'm sure it is not the same. But you know, things one loves... can't be painted over. The wind picked up Monday, and I am content, and I write my fifth letter and await your fifth silence. I can hear the family laughing below and if I write that I'm sad, it's dishonest and I know it. I know I will never see you again. Yet, I would like to know where you are! Where are you? You live and do not answer. Marité just missed killing herself jumping of a rock. Simon is in love. I bought two dresses. A blue one and a white one. Mother took her driver's test. We wonder why now. Antoine came to see us. It isn't true, I didn't buy those dresses. I just want to talk to you about myself. Your indifference doesn't hurt, just the names I give it: anger, forgetfulness. Cesar will always be Cesar, and you will always be David, who leads me without carrying me, holds me without taking me, loves me without wanting me. It's me. So I see. How's it going? And you? Ok. Well, no... A stone hit my windshield, smashed under my nose. Well? Nice, isn't it? You changed the curtains. Well, so... everything's fine. Everything's great. They're all there. Rosalie keeps busy, her mother spaces around, and the kids are fat and healthy. You know, vacation. - So, everything's ok? - Oh, yes... Well, no. In fact, nothing's ok. Nothing at all! You know, she's there and she isn't there. She does what she can, but not what she wants. She's down. At first, it was like at first... I mean, like before. Now, her laugh is empty. She goes out in the rain... anything! Worst, she doesn't ask for anything. It's like a wax museum. She moves like a real person, but it's wax. And it's driving me crazy! Poor Cesar! Yeah, poor Cesar. But why are you telling me this? So you'll come! I've no choice. Why no? Just no. Don't be an idiot! Don't you be an idiot! I'm not being an idiot! I'm afraid she'll leave. Hello, artist! Hey, how are you? Fine. Michel! How's it going? Fine. Except for the spelling of that girl you hired. Let's see. Can I use the phone? - Sure. The phone's upstairs. - Thanks. - Looks good to me. - Looks good to him. Cause she has a nice ass. Marcel? It's me. No, I'm in Paris. Look, uh... yes, yes, fine. Look, I can't go to Lyon. Because I can't, that's why! Come on, you three can handle it! Yes... Yes... Yes, in Poitiers, yes. I don't know! I'm not shouting. I'm talking. Yes, I'll call tonight, or come by. Right. Yes... Goodbye. So, aside from that? There is no aside from that! It's our lives; hers, mine and yours. If she's lost, we both lose. What do you want me to do? Look, David, I won't try to kid you. I figure, if she's with him... in the end... she'll get tired of him. She'll come back to me. Now, she imagines you. That's the worst. I can't fight imagination. I can't. I can't give her up. I said to myself... maybe David could... Oh, no! David can't do anything. I don't know anymore. What's that? A killer? Is that how you see me? I'm going back there. So, you don't want to come? Come on, that's enough. Stop it! No, I won't stop it! You came and ruined everything! Knock it off! You want to hit, I can hit too, you know! Get out, Cesar! - I'm ok. - Some in your hair. How's your arm? Ok. Cognac. You paying? Shall we go? The house. The sea. And that's only low tide. David's here! - Where? - There. My car broke down and he lent me his, so I invited him out. - How's the engine? - I changed the pump. - And? - It should work. Can we have a look? - We're going. Need anything? - No, thanks. I haven't seen the sea since... Why didn't you let me know? I didn't know myself. The house, everything... just like the letter. Whose letters? Where's Simon? Please, clean up the garage! - It was raining! - It stopped. - What's up? - I'm moving. He'll go to Louise's room, you take his bed. You get cold at night? The blankets... - Your bag? - I don't have any. You came like that? But... There! I'll go pick up Cesar, and then we'll eat. Who did you come for? Cesar or Rosalie? Coming! He thought it was the battery, but I... Why did you bring David? It wasn't me. He's big enough to come by himself. Exactly, he didn't come by himself. I don't know, I ran into him. In the street? No, at his place, because I had to go by for the paintings, there were bills. And there he was. And he said: I'll come. Right. What do you expect? What do you want? For you to be happy. So that's it. With David and Cesar. At the same time. I can't read your mind. Or your own, either. What are you afraid of? You're asking me that? I don't question things, I see them. When he's not here, you're empty. So, now that he's here, I'll see. We'll see. Fine. Hello, Michel. Fine, thank you. Not too good. How's Paris? Yes, I'll put him on. David, it's Michel. What is wrong, Louise? - Her dog was stolen. - It wasn't my dog. How was it stolen? Yes, I understand. Tell him to come! Have him call Marcel for my car. It must be ready. Ok, wait... When? Look, come on out here. Bring them with you. Where's he going? Poitiers, for a contract. He wants me to worry, even to pity him. That's his game. But I won't play... Not any more. Then what? I don't know, David. Simon's father's bedroom. Mother's second husband. How old were you? Ten, twelve... I was in love with him. Do you love me? But you love Cesar, or you wouldn't be here. And if you didn't love him, would you be here? - You didn't go... - To Poitiers? No, no. No, I came back. I'll call them. Let's take the boat out. Emile said it'll be a nice day. - Any calls for me? - At night? No. Your suit looks nice. Yes, it got rumpled from... Oh, shit! No harm done... - But it's you who... - It's me who what? Nothing. - Hi. - Hi. You're here? Yes, Cesar is here! Marité, cut the bread, I'll fix coffee. - Want to sleep? - No! Hey, Michel! Say, you got here fast! Yes, with this. Not bad! She's with us, mother! - A taste of wine? - No, thanks. Coffee? Hey, the boat's beached. We'll put it further out. You want to come help? Because it's heavy. Oh, shit! That hurts! Don't laugh, it hurts. Water. Wait, wait... Ok, ok, it's alright. I don't know what's wrong, I feel like fighting. With whom? With me. - The basket! - I've got it! She's here! It's just a gust of wind. Between the buoys. You have to go at low tide. We'll get up early. - Can we drag lines? - Sure. On the way out. - He has three. - Not necessarily. Two pairs queen high. - Shouldn't have. - Scared, eh? What? Two pairs king high. I'm too curious. - Hide your cards, stupid! - Just don't look. One card. Three kings. Two cards. And if I were to say three kings, two aces? Full house, kings? No. Oh, shit! - Impossible! - What's impossible? I discarded the king of hearts. Yes, but it fell down and I picked it up. - Then you cheated! - Yes. You're not angry? What a face! Well, real players wouldn't think it was funny. All going back to Paris tomorrow, to bed! One more! Certainly not. Do you know what time it is? Henri is worried about you. Me too. That's not an answer. What was the question? Not bad! - Where the hell is Emile? - I don't know. What time did he say? We'll pick it up port side. Where? Left. We got one. A little one. He goes out all year round, Emile, in any weather! One of the last fishermen. Take a good look. Soon, this whole coast line will be apartment houses. Of course, some are nice. Shall we go in? - Cold? - No. At what time do you fish tomorrow? - Come with us! - No. Why? It will be sunny. No, I don't want to. We have to be on the dock at 07h00. Just past the lighter. The what? And then between the little islands. Oh yes, there. Got a light? - No, got a light, Emile? - No. I don't smoke. You don't smoke? Good. Let's see. Fish stock, mayonnaise. That's all. Don't your eyes bother you? Wonder what it is. Look, Marité! A bass. Rosalie's gone. What? Yes, she's gone. What do you mean? This morning. Around 10h00, with Catherine... and all their things. But what did she say? Nothing. You know, she didn't want to talk. Don't look at me like that. She didn't tell me. But it's obvious. So it's over. There's no more I can do. Take my car, I'll go with Cesar. You're going too fast. - There are no cars. - There are trees. You may want to die, but I don't! Shit! Come on, get out. Cesar thought people couldn't part without discussing. But that's what happened. Neither he nor David tried to find her. Rosalie was worried at first. Then reassured. She only relied on herself, but she trusted time. She left the city. She looked for work, and found a job in Grenoble. David had news from her twice, from Marité. Cesar had news from David. Then she stopped writing. At first, Cesar played cards a lot and won a lot. But soon he started losing. So he stopped playing. Little by little, he left the business to his brothers. He sold his apartment, and moved into a house in the suburbs. Cesar never spoke of Rosalie again. David saw a great deal of Cesar, but an American magazine made an offer, David accepted it and went away. They took trains, they took planes. A year and few months passed. When he returned, David stayed at Cesar's. Let's be objective! Sure! You can easily do your animation right there! If they send you the money! This will make you laugh. You don't know yet. I nearly got married. At the last minute, I said no. What for? I'm fine as I am. I don't need... I do what I want. I was thinking... We leave Le Havre on Tuesday, first class sleeper, first stop Edinburgh! The weekend in Scotland, hunting, fishing! Pass me the lemon. We'd be back in Le Havre on Tuesday afternoon, and here by evening. Would that be ok? It's ok with me. But... What? Oh, your deadline? I'll call the guy. He's nice. Yeah, I saw him the other day. When we...
