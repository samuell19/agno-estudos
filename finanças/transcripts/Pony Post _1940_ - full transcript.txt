They about had you surrounded. Didn't they, partner? Thanks for helping me out. Get this mail through to Camp Floyd. I'll get the mail through, alright, and you too. - I don't think I can make it. - Oh, yes, you can. Now brace up. There's your rider now, Barber. It's about time. - Two hours late. - I don't see him, dad. You will, dear. Just keep watching that hill. There he is, Alice, just topping the hill. That isn't Whitmore. Why, there's two riders. One of them is hurt. What do you make out of that, Barber? Think they've been having more trouble over in Ruby Valley. It's likely. - Here's your mail, rider. - Hello, Sheridan. - What happened to our rider? - The Indians got him. If there's a doctor around here, you better get him right away. Hurry and get that doctor. Pardon me. What did the doctor say? Whitmore has better than an even chance. Thanks to Cal Sheridan here. I'm deeply indebted to you, sir. - I'm Major Goodwin. - It's a pleasure, major. - My daughter, Alice. - Delighted. Oh, doctor, how is he? Well, if he don't die of my treatment, he'll pull out in first-class shape. Guess there's no cause for worry. He'll come along. - Well, thanks, doctor. - That's easy to say now. Wait till you get my bill. - Be sure he's kept quiet. - Alright, doctor. I'll stay right here with him. I'll see that he's not disturbed. Oh, doctor, you'll drop back later? I'll drop back a couple hours. Bye. Dad, I was just thinking Mr. Sheridan may be the very man to take Griff Atkins' place at Ruby Valley. Yes, I've already thought of that, my dear. Well, I guess I'll be getting back to the diggings. It's been a pleasure, major. Sheridan, just what would you take to give up prospecting for a while and go to work for me in the Ruby Valley office? It wouldn't take much for me to give up prospecting, but I don't know much about pony express. Neither did anyone else six months ago. But you have a manager at Ruby Valley. Yes, Griff Atkins, but we've been having a lot of trouble in that district. - Indians? - Indians are bad enough. But we've had other things to contend with. The worst of it is, we haven't kept up our schedules. Well, that's a tough assignment for any man. We realize that, but Atkins hasn't been tending to business. He spends his time drinking and gambling. Yes, I've heard about some of his escapades. If anybody can help us, it's you, Sheridan. What do you say? Will you go to work for us? I'm afraid not, major. You can name your price. Well, it isn't the question of money. It's, uh-- - Then what is it? - Well, a lot of things. Between here and Carson City, uh, 550 miles of wilderness filled with bandits and Indians, and Ruby Valley is the worst section of the lot. You're not afraid, are you, Mr. Sheridan? It isn't that, but I don't think that I could get along with Atkins. You won't need to. I'm going to Ruby Valley and fire him. Well, I'd be pretty careful about that. Atkins is a bad-tempered sort of a fellow. But what can dad do? He has to get rid of Atkins. Please, Mr. Sheridan, won't you reconsider? It would make everything so much easier. It would take a stronger man than I to say no to you. Then you will? Well, it looks like you've talked me into it. Well, I'm surprised you held out against Alice as long as you did. - I've never been able to. - Good luck, Mr. Sheridan. Thanks. I'll be needing it. - Cards. - How many, Atkins? Give two. Give me three. Two. Dealer takes one. Art, it's up to you. I'll bet ten. - Beats me. - Pass. Well, I'll call that ten and force to raise you. I'll call. What have you got? King high flush. Three sevens. That beats me. I've had a lot of luck lately. All bad. Hey, Atkins, isn't it about time that westbound rider of yours was coming in? Why don't you mind your own business? Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean anything bad. Well, then keep your mouth shut. Now you be a good little pony and, uh, let Shorty put this saddle on you. It ain't gonna hurt none. Shorty wouldn't hurt you none. But... Oh, doggone it. Look. Look, ain't that a pretty saddle? And it's all leather too. Practically doesn't weigh nothin' at all. Mr. Atkins? It's Norma Reeves. Hello. Now just be a good pony, will you, please? Shorty? Oh, Shorty! - Yeah! - Where are you? Down here in the corral. I don't think you can saddle this doggone horse. Sure, I can. I ain't gonna let no horse get the best of me. Now you stand still. It will all be over in a minute. What's the matter, Shorty? Havin' trouble saddlin' up? Oh, this doggone horse. Now you know... it ain't gonna hurt you none. Doggone that old horse! I knew somethin' like this was gonna happen. Want me to saddle him for you? You'll have to shoot him first. Oh, he's alright. You just don't know how to talk to him. Talk to him? You mean he don't understand me when I do talk to him. Get that relay pony out here, Shorty. It's comin' right up. - Where's my relay? - I just fired him. You gotta go on to Cold Canyon. What do you think I am? I just rode all the way from Camp-- You heard what I said. Do it or quit! I ain't gonna quit, not on account of you. I'll be glad when the major gets here with that new manager. What'd you say about a new manager? You'll hear all about it in the next 24 hours. - Mr. Atkins. - What do you want? My dad sent me over with a requisition for some oats. We're just about out at Ten Mile Station. Well, what am I supposed to do about it? Did you hear what Grayson said about a new manager? Yes, and whoever the new man is, it will be an improvement. Couldn't be any worse. But, boy, oh, boy, was Atkins sore when he rode out. Hold up, major. I'm leaving you for a while. All this is Indian territory and it won't be very safe from here on. I'm going up into the hills and do a little scouting. You'll be close if we need you? You bet. I'll be where I can see you at all times. Heave. Why so unfriendly, boys? What's on your mind? - Business. - What kind of business? Well, if you gents will put down that hardware, I'll give you a chance to make some money, honestly. This is on the level, Richards. Alright, Claud, put 'em down. Well, that's better. Alright, let's have it, Atkins. Well, we need some hay for the stock and I saw a bunch of it near the fields the other day. I'll buy all you can spare and pay you what you figure it's worth. You mean you'll pay us what we ask? That's what I said. Can we do business? Don't see how we can lose. Do you, Claud? Not if there ain't a catch in it. Well, there is a little catch in it. Yeah? What's that? Well, I haven't got the money to pay for it right now. But Major Goodwin, the general manager of our line, is on his way in from Camp Floyd and should arrive soon. - What's that got to do with us? - Plenty. He's carryin' enough cash to pay off all the boys and clean up all the bills along the whole line. Is that so? I warned and told him he's a fool to carry around so much cash. Well, as long as you say Goodwin will be in to pay all, I reckon we could live with that hay. - Say, about 10 tons? - That's fine. Alright, gents, it's a bargain. By the way, Atkins, just as a matter of curiosity, how does Goodwin travel around with that money? - On the stagecoach? - Not the major. He has his own rig. Well, gents, see you later. You notice he didn't say a word about the price? We could charge him 200 a ton, if we had a mind to. Listen, he isn't interested in no hay. That hay gag was just a way of gettin' around what's really on his mind. He's got this district plastered with IOUs from gamblin'. He's tippin' us off to a way to make a killin'. You mean he's thinkin' to cut in? That's what he's thinkin'. - But I ain't. - You mean we'll pass it up? We ain't never pass up any good bet so far and it's too late to start in doing it now. What do you say, should we take a hint? We'd be fools if we didn't. Alice, look. Hold it, major. We'll take the road on the other side of the hill. It will be a little rough, but we can make it. Put down that box and get out of here. - You're fired. - Yes, sir. - Well, did you hear me? - Yes, sir. Well, then do it. - Do what? - Drop that box! You mean ju-- just drop it? Yes, drop it, you halfwit, before I knock your block off. Say, I-- I just forgot I gotta saddle the horse. I didn't mean to drop it on your foot. Honest, I didn't, Mr. Atkins. I'll teach you a lesson you'll never forget. Oh, get me out of here! Somebody, help me! - Whoa. - Glad to see you, major. - Welcome to Ruby Valley. - Thanks. You can go right in, miss. There's a couple of spare rooms. I'll make it right comfortable for you while you're here. This is Cal Sheridan. I've heard of Sheridan. I've heard of you, too, Mr. Atkins. Norma, I can't see a thing. It's all dark in here. Get me out of here! Well, I guess you know why I'm here. Oh, one of your regular inspection trips. You know better than that. I came to straighten out this district and I'm going to begin by getting rid of you. That may not be so easy. I've got a contract. Now listen, Atkins, I put you here because I believed that you were the only man I knew who had gumption and courage enough to carry out our schedules under any conditions. Then you admit the job was plenty tough. Oh, I never questioned that. But you haven't been attending to business. You've been spending your time drinking and gambling and getting yourself into debt. I don't let any man talk to me like that, major. I know something about this district. And what the major says is so. Whether it is or not, what business of yours is it? Well, Sheridan is taking over here. Oh, is that so? - Any objections? - Listen here, Atkins. You know, the first time you took a drink on this job, you violated your contract with our company. Now I don't wanna have any trouble with you, so I'm willing to settle and call the whole thing off. Well, I'm not settlin' anything and I'm gonna stay right where I am. Is that your final decision? Yes, and that's only part of it. Now you can get out and do it quick! That order goes to you, too, Sheridan. Now get out! I can see one thing right now, that this section isn't large enough for both of us. That's exactly the way I feel. Now it's your turn to get out, Atkins. Oh, don't go patting yourself on the back. Before I'm through with you, you'll wish you never heard of Ruby Valley. Listen, if you ever pull a gun on me again, it will be your last. Now get out! I have a hunch, major, that we're going to have a lot of trouble with that fella before we are through. Get me out of here! Where am I? Get me out of this force. I can't see a thing. You know, Atkins, that is a bum steer you gave us. It was as bad for me as it was for you. I'm fired. 'Cause of what happened out on the road? - What happened? - Oh, nothin'. By the way, Atkins, did some fella come in with Goodwin? Some fella ridin' a light horse? Well, that's Cal Sheridan. He's taken over my job. But I aim to see he don't hold it very long. See here, Atkins, if you tip off your hand, maybe we can work out something together. Well, here's a tip a couple of smart gents could use. Ten Mile Station is just askin' for somebody to grab it off. Old man Reeves and his daughter, Norma, are running it. Ain't that the gal that rides and shoots better than most men do? Yeah, now that's her, but she's here in Ruby Valley right now. Came for supplies. That leaves old man Reeves alone out at Ten Mile. There's a dozen of the best horses on the line in his corral. That sounds like a swell layout to me. Sure, and if somebody don't grab it off right away, the Indians will, and they're not as smart as they're given credit for. See ya later, Atkins. I'm tough and rough and I'm ready On a mustang I'm cool and I'm steady I can ride shoot and rope and tie better than any guy But I don't like no cows I'm really just a humdinger I can lick twenty men with one finger But when cows catch a sight of me They want a bite of me so I don't like no cows I act so refined with them I am so polite But when I try to be kind with them They always want to fight So that's why I'm looking so glum now As a cowboy I'm only a bum now Though I'm rough tough and big and strong Can't seem to get along 'cause I don't like no cows? That was fine, Shorty. - Won't you sing another song? - I ain't got time now, Normy. I gotta take care of Atkins' belongings. Oh, what you gonna do with them? Well, I figure as long as he ain't gonna be here no more, I might as well just throw 'em out. The way I figure, the new boss would be needing that space. So I thought I'd just pack up Atkins' stuff nice and neat. You know, this place is beginning to smell better already. If Atkins had given me my supplies yesterday, I could have been home by now. Yeah, I bet your pa misses you plenty too. I guess he does. Besides, that job's too hard for any one man to handle. You know, I'm going to be real nice to the new boss. Maybe he'll give me a job as rider instead of bein' a nursemaid to a lot of old broken-down broncs. Well, let's get this junk out of here. Shorty! Yes, sir. - What's all this stuff? - You mean all this stuff? That's exactly what I mean. That's what I thought you meant. Shorty was just cleaning out Atkins' things, Mr. Sheridan. That's right. What Norma says. But you can't do that to a man's belongings. - I can do it to Atkins. - No, you can't. Now you pack that stuff up and put it away, so he can get it when he comes after it. You mean, pick up all this stuff? Absolutely. That's what I thought you meant. Well, I'll do it, but I won't like it. Norma, I've arranged for a wagon to haul some stuff out at the Ten Mile Station. Good, then I'll be able to go home. Dad will be getting lonesome without me. And here are some instructions. I want you to read them and if there's anything in there you don't understand, I'll explain it to you. Now all the stations in this section are going to operate along these lines. Good, it's about time we had something definite to work on. Boss, I ain't gonna do it. What's the matter, Shorty? Oh, I'm protestin' officially. Well, what's your trouble? Well, I've been thinkin' a lot lately. Here I am, throwin' this stuff out here, pickin' it back up, takin' it back in, and puttin' saddles on the horses, takin' 'em off again, curling horses, cleaning horses, and all the time, I got ambition. Well, I'm mighty glad to hear that, Shorty. Say, you, you'll be needin' some new riders soon, won't ya? Yeah, I'll be needing several in the next few days. Well, if you, if you was to give me a job ridin', I say you was a regular fella. Well, maybe we can arrange it. You mean you will? Well, now, not so fast, Shorty. In the first place, you are too big. Now you have to train down a bit. Well, that will be easy. In the second place, I'd like to see what you can do on a horse. Oh, you ought to get out and practice mounting and riding and other things that will be necessary. Oh, boy, you ain't half as bad a fella as I thought you was. I think I'll go out and do some practicing right now. - Hey, Shorty. - Yeah? What about that stuff? You're a funny guy. Once you get somethin' in your head, ain't nothin' will get it out. That will be Fairweather coming in from Ten Mile Station. The Indians got all the horses at Ten Mile. - Well, how about my father? - I'm sorry, Norma. - He's... - Well, go on, Ned, go on. I'm... I'm afraid he's done for. I'm sorry, Normy. - You better get some rest. - Thanks, Cal. Shorty, take care of his horse. Norma, I'm going out to investigate as soon as I leave some instructions for Major Goodwin. - I'm going with you. - No, you better stay here. It's not going to be very pleasant. Hey, Shorty, do you know Bud Larson? - Sure. - Well, get a hold of him. Send him out to the Ten Mile Station. - I want him to take charge. - Alright, boss. Hey, Willie! Keep that horse walkin'. I got some business to tend to. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Now stand still. Now whoa, wait. Oh, come on. Come on. Oh, boy. Now wait a minute. You don't have to rush. Wait a minute. Hold it. Hold. Hold. Hold. - You let me go. - Oh, no. I'm going to my father and you can't stop me. Yes, but there are Indians out there. Oh, I don't care. I'm not afraid. Well, you ought to be. You know what they do when they catch a white woman? Oh, but I've got to go. Don't you understand? Yes, Norma, I do. And if you will promise to stay right close to me, I'll let you go. - Alright, I promise. - Good. Norma, your father wasn't killed by Indians. But that arrow. Someone planted it there to throw suspicion on the Indians. There's been a lot of that sort of thing going on around here. Let's have a look around. - Hi, boys! - Hi, Shorty! What are you gonna have, Shorty? Oh, I'll take the usual. There you are. Hey, hey, what is it? - What's this? - Apple cider. - Isn't that what you ordered? - Apple cider? What do you take me for, a sissy? Give me some beer. Root beer. - Hello, Shorty. - Hi. Uh, how is the new boss? The new boss, Sheridan? Say, Sheridan's the best manager that ever came out here. - Right on the job, eh? - On the job? He's the best feller I ever did see, too, and the smartest. Show you how smart he is. He aims to make a express rider out of me. Well, what's wrong with that? Shorty, that's fine, fine. Uh, do you think you can handle it? I can't miss. He told me all I had to do was to learn some fancy ridin' to train down to half my size. Say, maybe he can make a rider out of me. - No, you wouldn't do. - Well, how do you know? You tell me where I can find Sheridan, I'll see what he has to say. Well, he's on his way to the Ten Mile Station. Bunch of redskins stole all the horses and killed old man Reeves. - Is that a fact? - Yup. I'd have gone out there with him, but one of us had to look after some important business here. - You sure it's redskins? - Well, I-- Say, that's an idea. You know, there's a lot of bad actors around here that aren't red at all. Oh, it won't make no difference nohow. As soon as Sheridan gets back, he'll know who done it. Say, Shorty, if you're in training, you better put that root beer down. That's just what I'm gonna do. Put it down. When did your father have the horses shod last? He took them to Ruby Valley only last week. The man we're after is riding a horse with a broken shoe. I think we'd better get into town. Well, but what about my... I'll send someone out later to take care of things. Now with this new invention of mine, anybody can make a pony express. All you have to do is jump on here and it will bounce you right up on the saddle. You're sure it will work? You just watch me and I'll show you. Let's see. Step aside. Stand back a little more. Well, here I come. Shorty! That's funny. It didn't work, did it? I reckon I'll have to get a... bigger s-- spring for it. Way back in Oklahoma in 1794 He ran into an Indian band a million braves or more They took out down the hill for him And he grabs old Betsy here And mowed 'em down right to the ground And he's done the same each year Way back in Oklahoma they called him Honest Will Because he don't exaggerate the stories that he tell - They're not bad for amateurs. - Amateurs, dad? Why, Shorty would throw a fit if he heard you say that. Honestly, Cal, you'd scream if you could have seen Shorty these past few days. What's he been doing? He's been training to become a rider. You don't mean he took what I told him seriously? Seriously? Why, he's even invented a new device to make fast mount. He told me he's gonna put on an exhibition for you. - When? - The end of this week. I'd pay admission to see that. Too bad we won't be here. You mean we're leaving? So soon? I'm entirely satisfied with the way Sheridan has put the district back on an efficient basis. Now, there's very little more to be done except to keep it that way. As a matter of fact, major, I've done very little. Well, what about Atkins... and whoever murdered Norma's father? Oh, I don't think Atkins will show up around here anymore. And as for those horse thieves, well, you'll just have to keep your eyes and ears open, my boy. When do you figure on leaving, major? Day after tomorrow at the latest. I'll see that you get an escort through the Indian territory. Fine. I'm leaving pretty early in the morning. I've got to get some horses over to Ten Mile Station. May I go along? I'd certainly enjoy your company, but I don't think you'd better. Alice, Mr. Sheridan is not going on a pleasure trip. - He has business to look after. - It isn't that, major. It's just that the trails are very dangerous. Well, that settles it. ...back in Oklahoma They called him Honest Will Because he don't exaggerate The stories that he tell Say, boys, this time kinda bit of down a little bit. You know, uh, uh, like it's underneath a haystack. Romantic. Western skies are heavy As I ride along the glade Singing through the twilight My saddle serenade Though the night be slowly falling There's no need to be afraid As long as I've a pony And my saddle serenade Sun is sinking low old-timer Oh yonder in the west Time to settle down old-timer Time to settle down and rest As I ride along the glade Singing through the twilight My saddle serenade Though the night be slowly falling There's no need to be afraid As long as I've a pony And my saddle serenade Come on and ride ride ride O'er the mountainside When the sun comes around tomorrow To light up the Great Divide We're gonna reel and roll Till we reach our goal So let's hop aboard our ponies And we'll ride ride ride Come on and ride ride ride O'er the mountainside When the sun comes around tomorrow To light up the Great Divide We're gonna reel and roll Till we reach our goal So let's hop aboard our ponies And we'll ride ride ride That's alright, Shorty boy. That's too much for me. Well, goodnight, Sheridan, and good luck. Thanks, major. - Goodnight, Alice. - Goodnight. - Good morning, Shorty. - Morning. I got him all saddled and polished down fine for you. Good, but who is this other horse for? That's mine. I've been takin' him out and sort of polish off a few of the rough edges. I'm gonna show you something in a few days that will surprise you. I understand you've been doing a lot of practicing lately. I sure have. And let me tell you somethin'. I'm gonna show you some ridin' you never saw before. Yes siree, if I don't turn out to be the best pony express rider in this district, I hope to drop right now. Ooh! If I were you, Shorty, I think I would try some walking lessons first. I guess I just naturally born an awkward cuss. That's one time a fool you give 'em a bucket. Beat it up, Brownie! Attaboy, let's get movin'. Help! Hey, Brownie! You come right back here and help me out of this tree! Dixie! Brownie? You come right back here! Doggone! Ain't you a dummy? Stick your hand down a hole. Hey. Kinda peaceful around here. I think I'll just take a little catnap. - Howdy, gents? - Out kinda early. Ain't you, Atkins? What'd you do with the horses? What horses? No use beatin' around the bush. I guess we understand each other. I guess we do. We got them staked out in the hills. - Anything on your mind? - Yeah. I know a fellow who'll buy all the horses he can get. No questions asked. He'll sell 'em right back to the pony express for a fancy price. I bought a lot from him myself. Looks like more and more we understand each other. It sure does. The line will be needing some new remounts right away. So the quicker you deliver the horses, the better. - Maybe we better do it now. - Maybe so. We'll be back in to celebrate after it's all over. Come on, Brownie! Run, Brownie! Come on, boy! Here come 'em Indians. Come on, Brownie! Attaboy! Hold it steady. Look out, Claud! Come on! They're gettin' close. Come on, boy. Indians! We sure stopped 'em, didn't we, Cal? We sure did. Hey, Shorty, how did you get into this mix-up? Oh, well, uh, I was just practicin' and they must've thought I was one of the regular riders. Oh, I see. Hey, Shorty, where's that man? - What man? - My prisoner. What? You sure there ain't something wrong with you? I d-- I-- I didn't see nobody. Well, he was here a few minutes ago. Maybe the heat's got you. Come on, Shorty. I've got a lot of horses to get back to Ten Mile Station. Ten Mile Station? Where'd you get 'em? From the little man who isn't there. Bartender. You didn't get those horses rockin' home already? You didn't expect us to, did you? That was a fine double-cross you pulled. What are you talking about? I didn't double-cross nobody. - Why should I? - I'll tell you why. You figured you better fix up your job with the pony express. Get us to steal them horses, then tip 'em off. Oh, you're talking through your hat. You mean, you never sent that posse? What have you been drinking? Ah, there ain't no time for kiddin'. They got my brother, Claud, and all the horses. They? Who's they? We was heading those horses through the draw. All of a sudden, we heard shootin'. Then this fellow, Cal, came at us with the rest of 'em right behind him. There wasn't anything for us to do but split up and make a run for it. Hm, that sure sounds bad. Well, what are we gonna do now? Maybe we ought to wait and see what happens. What are you doing to my horse? Claud Richards, you killed my father. Gal or no gal, I ain't lettin' you get away with that. That's Norma and the man that got away from us. Cal, that's Claud Richards, the man who killed father. Here, Shorty, take care of the horses. Come on, all you horses. Doggone, leave me here with all of you. Hold him right there, Claud. Come on. We'll get him from behind. Well, Norma, it looks like we'll be able to breathe some fresh air from now on. Leaving us today, Major Goodwin? Yes, going home, Norma. I'm sorry to hear that, but thanks for the new job. Thank Mr. Sheridan. He's the one who said he could use you here. I'll take your advice. Goodbye again. Goodbye, Miss Goodwin. Hey, folks! I wanna show you my new invention. Hey, folks, I've got an invention that's gonna revolutionize the pony express business. Now you watch me get on that horse. I think I better get a bigger horse. Hey, I'll never know if this works.
