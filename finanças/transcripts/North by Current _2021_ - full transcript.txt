In this world, most people think that who you are is a compilation of things that've happened to you or a series of choices you made, maybe the circumstances you were born into. Did you choose the right friends? Did your mother love you good enough? How did you become who you became? Hey. How are you? Good. I'm doing it now. What's the weather like there? Do I need hats and gloves and stuff or? Okay. You gonna tell me what happened? Case dismissed. Thank God. You know, I guess they could do anything. But it'd be awfully hard to accuse her of murder when she was found not guilty of child abuse. Did she say that? I mean, there wasn't very far after that the prosecutor could go.

You cream them together. -I guess it went well. He's not in jail. So... I haven't asked anybody, though, how it went. But I guess it went okay. But we were really expecting the worst because, you know. - Uncle Dave, you wanna say it? - Sure. Eternal Father in Heaven, we gather together as family to celebrate this Christmas time of the year. Remember those members of our family that are not with us, long since departed, and are grateful for their direction and guidance through our lives. Pay particular attention to them at this time. We also celebrate the life of our savior and brother, Jesus Christ, this time of the year. In the Mormon tradition, your blood family is an eternal bond: a unit that exists beyond the mortal world. And parents have no greater responsibility than to raise children. Dang. I got way too many grand-kids in here. Wanna see a picture of them? How come you guys don't keep any more recent pictures of me around the house? - In here? - No, around the house. -I don't know. Ask your mom. We've got one of Anthony, Freddy, and Anna. Can you see her stubby little toes on that screen? Sticking up above that thing. Get your feet down. -I'll put 'em down. She's not filming yet, is she? He. Making a snowman for Angie. Oh.

Once when you just watched it, once when I staged and filmed it, and then the first time, when four days after Kalla's funeral, we walked into this diner and sat down for lunch. It was my sister's first time out of the house in two weeks. What's happening Grandma? There's Uncle Madsen. He's definitely Uncle Madsen. From the silence, this song came on the jukebox. ♪ Where oh where can my baby be... Was that the music that was playing in there that day? That was pretty ironic. No one seemed to notice it but me. - Makes me wanna cry. - I know. I can't believe that was on there. Probably a sandwich. How much longer is this gonna be? I've periodically considered the possibility that I dreamt this. But I'm so certain it happened. My mother's crying because the song is about a lost baby. Yep. Pretty good over there. 33 loads of lumber this week. 33 semi-loads of hardwood lumber shipped out. Here, I'll show you something else. Mom, you. I think that's you. That's me. Jesse and Kalla. Our little Kalla when she was a little, sweet little baby. And Kalla shortly before she died. I wanna pause a moment to clarify that this is not an image of Kalla. For some reason, I just feel like I can't share those right now. Albeit hazy, it is absolutely an image of my sister, Jesse. You know, when we went over to Cadillac that morning, we were driving over, it was a morning just like this in February. It was all gray. Seems like a little bit of sun was peeking out. It was snow-covered. Jesse called me, crying, and said, "Mom, I'm in the back of the police car, and the ambulance is in front of me. And we're on our way to the hospital with Kalla. I found her in her crib this morning not breathing." And then the numbness set in and the funeral. And Jesse was just kinda out of it. Oh. And then the investigation of how she died set in, and then our second nightmare on top of our first nightmare began. You know, at first at the hospital when we asked what happened, they had no reason to believe there was anything but a tragic accident. So, we were kinda shocked when we saw that changing. And he, Golnick came to our house and started questioning us. They came constantly, night and day. They would try to come at night. They'd try to get you to be a little sleepy, or they'd hope that you have a little drink in you or something like that, you know. And they'd come 9, 10, 11:00. Then they'd come back at 8 in the morning, 9 in the morning. Doctors and police and stuff, they're swearing to it, that you committed this murder. And you're like, "Who am I? I'm some ex-convict with a violent past, and they're gonna believe me over five doctors?" Here you can have this one. You can have it. That's too much JoJo. ...build the electoral college to safeguard the American people from the dangers of the demagogue... Two weeks after Kalla's death, my sister married David. The first time I met him was at the funeral. They'd been living together less than a week when she died. Because Jesse was believing in David and not leaving him, then they began to suspect perhaps Jesse had something to do with it. And CPS got involved, Child Protective Services, and... they charged her and David with child abuse. Hello, Jesse! What do you say when you console a child from a nightmare? You tell them that it will be okay, that nothing will hurt them. As if they have some kind of special immunity from suffering. No, no, no. Daddy told you not to give the puppy that. When they discover that they are not immune, they will hold this lie against you for the rest of your life. Baby. Shh, you're okay. Yeah, you're okay. What else? You wanna hear about our other kid we lost? Well, we've lost two: a grandchild and a daughter. We had a little girl named Angela. She was quite the character. And we never talked about it before, but she was quite the little sweetheart. So, you would equate my transition with Kalla's death. Well, you got all the memories of a little girl growing up. I think it would be the same thing if you had a child and something happened to that child, and they no longer were the same person. You would grieve, you know, who they were for the years that they were someone different. You wanna go to the beach or not? And once I realized I had to grieve that as a loss, then it helped with my acceptance a lot better, in regards to your decision to transition. Earlier today, my parents told me I was dead, and they had to grieve me. If I hadn't been so completely caught off guard by this comment, I maybe could have responded. But I was shocked because... I've just worked so hard to be alive. Fuck. Ugh. It's really beautiful out right now. I don't know if you can see. Might be too dark. Zeus's daughter, Aphrodite, could transform herself into a fish to swim from harm. But long gone are the tales of shape-shifting, sex-changing gods. In this world, there's no escape from pain, nor body, time, nor death. The death certificate was issued. And on the death certificate was "Homicide and child abuse that occurred monthly, weekly, daily." And that probably was... It said that on the certificate? - Uh-huh. - It said, "Monthly, weekly, daily?" Uh-huh. And that was probably the point when we knew something was wrong because we had Kalla. We had Kalla three days prior to her death, and we knew there was no beating or bruising monthly, weekly, and daily. 'Cause we would've had to be involved in that. Rusty Rivets. Pathologists stated that Kalla died of acute brain bleed, she was slammed against a wall, and that she had bruises all over her body and was beaten and abused for quite a while. Golnick's been down there before on cases, and they've known each other and go, I'll tell you exactly what he said to me and what I believe he probably said to her: "This guy's a scumbag and he's been in jail before, and he killed this baby. And we're gonna get him," you know. And then she just kinda let the report slide the way, lean toward the way he wanted it to go. All right. You can edit stuff out, right? Yeah. So, I was kept in complete isolation, maximum security, one hour a day out of my cell. And just constant, people yelling, "Baby killer! Baby Killer," everywhere I went. To stay sane in jail, I just prayed a lot, and I wrote Jesse letters like nonstop. Oh, an apple! Huh? - Uh-oh! - Where'd it go? If Jesse doesn't get to a point where she ever wants to talk to me, I'm not gonna like, try to make... I think she'll talk to you, I just don't think that... She's been forced to relive the events of that weekend so many times that it just sets her back mentally. And that's just not how she copes. That's not her coping mechanism. -Mom, I can't hear it! I can't hear it! Mommy, I can't hear it!! There. When David was released for the last time, Levi was 11 months old. You go to jail! You go to jail! You're the bad guy! No, I'm not the bad guy, I'm Batman! All right. I'm in jail now. Can I come out of jail? - No. - Why? Because you can't! Levi. Are you gonna try to use this stuff and kinda make a film of it? You haven't decided yet how you're putting it together? Well, I'm trying to weave these different strands of stories. I hope for the sake of Kalla that you can present it in a way that's not... vile. "Vile" may not be a good word, but well, sometimes your work can be very... I don't know what the word for it is, but sometimes your work can be kinda out there. The vileness my mom's referring to is my reverence around sexuality. To me, sex is a cosmic thing, inherently linked to death because both are conduits to other worlds. Both are about endings but also beginnings. Pick up the pears for me, Levi. You don't get to the pregnancy and giving of life part without the sex part. What do you got? Carrots? Uh-uh. No one knows that more intimately than mothers. Your mother is the first awesome miracle that will haunt you your whole life. ♪ When Heaven made you, darling, ♪ They made a dream come true ♪ And I'll always thank Heaven ♪ for sending me you ♪ An angel, sweet and perfect, in everything you do ♪ And my darling- ♪ Only getting into the mid-20s today, a little colder, northwest winds gusting to 25.

Temperatures staying around 20. And then tomorrow, occasional snow showers, highs in the mid... There's us. We're in bed. Say, "Good morning, America." Can you say, "Good morning, America?" Morning, good morning, America. Good. Up at 7:30. All three diapers changed as soon as I wake up. Then breakfast at 8:00 for all three including, for the three babies and the bigger kids. Then, when breakfast is done, clean up breakfast, cartoon time, and then it's gonna be snack time. And after snack time is all done, then it's gonna be nap time. And 12:00-3:00 is what I call "quiet time." After that, then it's just chaos, but my day's almost over. Two months after Kalla's death, my sister was pregnant with Levi. This cycle repeats itself three times. One, two, three. Three children for three years gone. Do you think that Jesse's repetitive breeding is a way to fill that hole? Yeah. I think that she really, what's the word I'm thinking about, yearns to hold that baby in her arms. And once those babies start to get bigger, they don't give her that same feeling. I have another question for my mom, but I can't quite figure out how to ask it. So, I ask around it. ♪ But for me, a sinner, He suffered, ♪ He bled, and died ♪ It was only shortly after Kalla had passed away, and there were some new missionaries that came out from Idaho. And we were telling them our story, and one day they said, "You know, we have a church member that is a pathologist. He might be able to give you a second opinion of the autopsy." We met with Dr. Ormsbee after church on Sunday, and he took the autopsy report. And it was old blood that was on the slides. He said, "That baby was not abused. That baby died of a chronic brain bleed." And a chronic brain bleed is one that's been going for probably weeks or months. My mom believes the doctor was a messenger, a testament to the truth of the Mormon faith. She also believes that there are many gods and goddesses in the cosmos. That in the celestial kingdom, 1,000 years is equivalent to a single day. And that after death, the physical body will be reunited with the spirit body. And while she's been telling those of us around her that she loves us. Today she's telling heavenly father how much she loves him. You're watching a video from my baptism when I was eight years old. I wouldn't trouble you with this memory, but I have to tell you that when I came out of the water that day, everything felt different. Because when you have a revelation, you acknowledge a need, a desire for something outside and beyond yourself. 1991, Angela just got baptized in Lake Margrethe. There's Angela! You start assessing the borders between belief and truth. What you know and what you trust. An I-Team investigation uncovers the child abuse convictions of dozens of people in Michigan are now being called into question. And the tragic death of a three-year-old girl here in West Michigan has opened up some new conversations about whether innocent people are sitting in prison for crimes they did not commit. Tonight, the I-Team's Brian Duffy shares his findings in a special report. Research is casting doubt on... They knew that if David and Jesse were found not guilty of child abuse, what would that do to their criminal case? So, they ultimately ended up dropping the criminal case. Does Jesse ever talk about anything that happened? No, Jesse don't talk about Kalla at all. At first, I wanted to make a film about injustice. And here we are. You know hardly anything about the investigation, and you know the tip of the iceberg about a random family in nowhere Michigan. Get some popsicles. The kids love popsicles. This is what they like, right here. I would, however, like to take this moment to tell you, that the lead detective on this case is now a dogcatcher somewhere in Florida, and the corrupt Child Protective Service worker got fired after leaving a bar drunk to pick up a four-year-old child. It was all bits and pieces, really. Definitely not something I like to try to remember or talk about. Well, I'm gonna take my favorite duck home. What's your favorite duck? - This one. - Why? Look at it. Look at the wood patterns on the wood, block of wood it was carved out of. You can see parts of the red in the eye. Memory must be created against an abundance of information. But also against an absence. It has to be constructed. You assemble the fractures, arrange the incidences to build a story. Notice the surge of Arctic air settling across the Central Plains. We'll see our temperatures actually tumble on Saturday... The moment something terrible ends is the moment you begin to ingest how terrible it really was. Children dying. It's got to be emotionally draining. There is an ever-present sense of loss. She's constructed an emotional shield to protect her unconscious from turmoil. - Uncle Mad... - What the fuck? Jesse! Jesse! Dad, call 911. Jess, let me in! Jess, please let me in. - What's happening? Jess, please let me in, honey. What's happening? Hi, I need an ambulance immediately. I want mama. Hello, my sister's unconscious so we called 911. What's happening with Momma? What's happening? Did Momma die? You know, I, she... You know, the depression is so deep that she doesn't even, she can't make good, safe decisions for those babies. Last six weeks... last six weeks she's been behaving like she used to behave when she was on drugs. What happened yesterday was really just a manifestation of what has been happening since Kalla died. You put it away, but it doesn't go away. You know, I think the fact that she wouldn't reach out to you when you were right there just goes to show you how she copes. She... She came in, and she did that laughing thing - that she does. - Mmhmm. And I... didn't, I didn't, you know, I don't know. I didn't think to... - Well, you don't. - What to say or do. Yeah. Or you don't think that she's in distress because she, that's how she laughs it off. - Yeah. - Yeah. I think the revisiting of this story with you, even to the simple little thing that probably didn't hit us so hard was going to Steven's. Because that was something we had done together. And... Did you remember that we had done that? Mmhmm. I remember that we had done that. I remember the surreal-ness of that. And I suspect even if she didn't really remember it consciously, that there was some of that circular grieving that was starting to surface in her. My sister is the most impenetrable person I know. I've been trying to understand her since her first overdose, over 10 years ago. But I wasn't always trying. Jesse, you know, looking back, she is so resilient and such a survivor. 'Cause, you know, she always felt like she was not as smart or as talented as you. And then as we got older, you know, life became such a struggle for you, and some of your demands became so overwhelming for us. And then Jesse started having problems, but she didn't wanna tell us because she felt like we had our hands full with you. And then when she got pregnant for Kalla, she came and moved in with us and gave up all the drugs and focused her life on Kalla. So, Kalla was a blessing in that sense. Most humans emerge into the world with a name, a family, a neighborhood. Your insides are filled with memories of togetherness and alone-ness, mixed with limitless desires, sensations of unspeakable beauty, awe, mystery. But children of a certain age believe that fate is moral. That bad things happen because you were bad. Well, you hung around with a pretty strong group of friends. And none of them became addicts, and you did. That makes you wonder why were you the one of all of those that became an addict? Rich kids, who grew up in mansions would get addicted to drugs. Anybody can get addicted to drugs, Mom. What do you think, Madsen? I sorta checked out over the last couple minutes. Sorry. What? She was saying that it didn't make sense that... I just had a thought that I was like, "I need to check out from this conversation. - It's too intense." - Aw. Everything is too intense for you! Can't you just, like, slow your brain down? Like, don't think so hard. I screwed up at the end. I said the wrong part! Don't worry about it. It's okay. You ran out of tape. You were an angry teenager. One time, do you know what you said to me? You said to me, "I'm gonna push you out that window and take pictures of your decapitated body." Yeah, you were a fruitcake. You had problems growing up, probably because you were a man in a woman's body, and you were taking it out on me. Whoa, baby! Show us them muscles in your arms. You were abusive. You were emotionally and physically abusive. And you're probably why I had a drug problem when I grew up. There's no other times you felt taken care of by me? Mm-mm. No, no other times I can remember. Big feelings scare me. This is well documented by my trail of failed relationships with emotionally expressive people who feel that I have what may be called an empathy problem. I don't know if this is something I developed or just always had. Tell me. Is stoicism only for men? ♪ When I was a little boy, taken from my mama, ♪ Down the dusty road, never seen again ♪ Gamble all my money, drink all my money, ♪ Give you all my money, just tell me what to do ♪ Oh, oh, I sing these blues... ♪ Some things are so ingrained in you that it's hard to get rid of them. You're kind of a product of your environment, but you can only blame that to a certain extent. Once you're an adult, you have to start making your own decisions and choices, so. Get back. You can't go through life saying, "My daddy spanked me or was an alcoholic, so I'm gonna be a piece of crap the rest of my life." That's not really part of growing up and having accountability. In your world, there's a tension between what it means to be a good man and what it means to be a real man. You are told that fracturing is unbecoming. That a picture of wholeness is by far more satisfying. Stronger. Snotface? Are you a snotface? I can see him sitting in the chair. - Is he awake? - Uh-uh. Passed out? I can tell when I'm looking at him, 'cause he looks different, you know what I mean? You know when you know somebody well enough, you know when they're like... Yeah, you know when they're fucked up. 'Cause I could see him through the window, and he was just like this, in the chair. Oh, you can't be around it. You're not strong enough yet. I'm going around seeing shit, you know. Like obviously, I can't be the... You're not the rock right now. ...the strength of the relationship. Huh? - You're not the rock right now. - No, yeah. -And that's okay. People take turns being rocks. - That's right. - But like... If he's in re-, he'll never, he needs rehab. And he would hate that, absolutely hate that. 'Cause his dad was always in rehab when he was growing up. What day are you leaving? - Tomorrow morning. Madsen! You told me you were gonna stay the extra day. I did. Today is the extra day. - It is? - Mmhmm. No. Because my psychiatrist appointment is tomorrow at 2:00. The extra day that I was staying was for David's arraignment this morning. Shit! Okay. Well, how about Friday? Madsen! You dick. We just had a brilliant idea. My mom asked the church elders about me. They tell her that if God truly intended for me to be a man then I'd be given the correct genitals in the afterlife. I'm clearly not the only one who puts sex and death in the same sentence. My dad believes that it's our human duty to reproduce. He had a revelation. He had a visit. Because before Christ can return, all souls must populate a body. It's our human job to offer those souls a body to occupy. In this line of thought, a body that does not reproduce is inherently less valuable. Are you less valuable? What do you got Ang? Ah, a little baby. Jesse got a baby too. Where, how do babies, how does the baby come out of my belly? You push it out your butt? Mmhmm. Oowie! And do you want it to be a baby boy or baby girl? - Me? - Yeah. I'm not going to be a baby! No, the baby in my belly. You want it to be a baby boy or baby girl? Levi, Levi. You didn't say anything about it. - Whoa! Owie! - Are you happy about it? Yeah! Aren't you? Stoked! You guys are all party poopers. Wheeee! Ooh. Ow. Uncle Madsen! Uncle Madsen! Hey, stop! You stop messing with my clock, mister! Ancients thought that time was cyclical, related to the rotation of the celestial bodies. The movement of stars and planets. It's only since the Christian re-definition of time that you think about time as irreversible, with a beginning, genesis, and end, apocalypse. Would you like to tell them now? I know this is non-linear, but I have another piece of an earlier story to tell you. A month before Kalla's death, she fell down the stairs. She suffered a slow brain bleed that was undetected by the immediate ER visit and CT scan. To add pain to pain, she had tripped on her blanket. She was in the process of seeking comfort. David was watching her. Close your eyes, and tap your heels together three times, and think to yourself, "There's no place like home. There's no place like home. There's no place like home." - One. - There's no place like home. - Two. - There's no place like home. Goodbye, Dorothy! What do you think? It's improved drastically from the last one. From when we were in school? No, just from the last one I took Levi to. They didn't have microphones or anything with Levi here before. Or wands. All right, what do you want to eat? Whatever. You gotta be hungry, too. I am, but I'm not really eating fast food right now, so. I'll eat at the house. Oh. So, you're just not going to eat anything? I'll make something at the house. - So, are you buying my food? - Yeah, I'm buying your food. Um... Taco Bell, or? Are you wearing a seat-belt? - No. - Put a seat-belt on. I forgot. Oh my god, turn it up. ♪ Whispers at the bus stop ♪ Well, I've heard about nights out in the school yard ♪ I found out about you ♪ I found out about you... ♪ So, Sherry called me about, I don't know, 7:00 in the morning, 'cause we started at 6:00. She says, "Fred, I got a problem." I said, "What?" She said, "David's drunk at work here." I said, "Oh, really?" She says, "Yup." She says, "Would you come and take him in for his test? 'Cause I think it'd kinda be awkward if I tell him. I didn't want him to..." You know, I think they were leery about him getting aggressive or something. But I said, "All right, I'll be there." So, I zipped into work there and... definitely drunk. He's got a few addictions. So, Mom and I been praying every night for that. There's a car. - They're here! - Who's here?! Hi, Benny! We're all really sick. We got a bad cough and cold, so make sure you sanitize your hands a lot. Please don't tape record me now. Are you serious? I haven't taken a shower in like three days. Take him, Mom. I'm working up a sweat here. When David is at his worst, Jesse and all the kids stay at Mom and Dad's. He visits, but only during the day. He doesn't wanna talk to me anymore. What are you doing? I see you got your tooth fixed. -Mmhmm. It's still sensitive. Yeah. Like, I prefer to drink out of a straw. Her teeth were replaced this week. She says she fell in the shower. Everyone believes her. Only happens to me, this kinda stuff. Yeah. What do you think it is about you that attracts this kind of fun stuff? I guess God thinks I can handle it, but apparently he's wrong. You know how they say you don't get what you can't handle? You know what I mean? What kinda jet is that? Papa probably knows. Papa used to be in the Air Force, and he would fly on a plane like this. Gram, would this kill somebody? So, he brought the picture of Kalla out a couple weeks ago, and he said to me, "Gramma, who's this?" And I said, "That's Kalla." And he said, "Who's Kalla?" And I said, "Kalla was your older sister." And he said, "Well, where is she?" I said, "Well, Kalla died." And he said, "Well, where did she go?" And I said, "Well, when you die, you go to Heaven." And she said, "Well, how did she die?" And I said, "She fell and hit her head." And he said, "Where was my mom?" And I said, "Well, your mama wasn't there when she fell." But I didn't bother to say that your daddy was home with her, but I said, "Your mama wasn't there when she fell." And then he was like, "Oh." And then he never asked any more questions. He didn't say, "Where was Daddy? Where was Papa?" He said, "Where was Mama?" 'Cause I guess he's convinced Mama would have stopped it from happening if Mama would've been there. In early life, the veil between worlds is lowered. But when children develop memory and imagination, they also begin to understand time. There are things that were and things that are and things that will be. You know, there's the grief of losing... the grief of losing all those rites of passage that you experience with a child. And those are all taken from you. Because that's changed, it's a hard thing to adapt to. Sometimes it's unclear if Mom is talking about you or about me. She's talking about you. You, who is very much alive. But also you. Some endings are lost in a sea of beginnings. I know. Look at how awake you are! Look how awake you are, little guy! - Mom, can I hold him? - Sure, come on up. Let's wrap him up first so he stays nice and warm. Okay, lean against the couch. All right, are you comfy? Oh, I don't, I don't actually wanna hold him. I'll stay right by you. - No, I don't. - No? Okay. You just wanna check him out? - Mmhmm. Okay. He's nervous. Lookit! Uncle Madsen, look over there! - Fireworks. - Huh? - Fireworks. - Why? I feel a deep sense of sorrow for this man. For the things that've happened, but also, because he was never told that being a good man is the same thing as being a good person. ♪ Been wasting my time talking to you ♪ it just don't do me no good ♪ you can turn my way or you can walk away ♪ or you can love me like you should ♪ Well, I can- ♪ Great temperatures! The heat continues on. Yeah, you're right: a nice weekend coming up, at least Saturday, as you mentioned. Maybe a little rain later Sunday. We'll talk more about that coming up in a few minutes, but it was a nice day today. Humans create stories to explain things, to understand the world they occupy. You already know that. But when you lie to yourself long enough, you begin to believe a particular version of a story. Hang on. - Are you ready? - No. Ugh, the camera. First, tell me what really happened to your teeth. My teeth got kicked in by my husband. And I'm all fixed. But they're chipping off again. See? Right there. But... Why did he do that? He was drunk. And I instantly felt the flood, and I went. Hm-hmm-mm! I kinda did one of these to walk away from Levi, but it was everywhere. He was like, "Mom you're bleeding. You're bleeding" I was like, "I'm okay!" I just did the best I could. Yeah. Before, I constantly had black eyes and bloody lips. All the time. - I know. And I would say, and Mom thought that I was like... She told me a couple days ago, I got really upset with her like a week ago because she sent me this long text saying about how I have these children to take care of, and I'm obviously in a state of hypomanic, or what's that word? Hypoman-? - Mania? - Yeah, hypomania. She thinks that if I put on makeup or lose baby weight, that I'm acting manic-y, like. But really, I'm just not pregnant. I've been pregnant for four years. Yeah, I'm right here. Yeah? Yeah?! Don't just leave him like that with Benny. - Sorry. - Hanging all over him. Should we all go on a blankie hunt together? Oh, Mama found it first. The cycles of pregnancies and births and depressions have historically ended in breakdowns or relapses. And I've spent the last five years trying to accept my powerlessness to change this. Lookit. I got a little orangutan. I smuggled him in. Grandpa, here comes Daddy! Well, I gotta keep playing with this baby. Don't push him, Ben. Sometimes I try to take pictures of Mommy and Daddy, and sometimes Mom and Daddy get apart, and Mommy goes over here and Daddy goes over there. But I need Daddy to stay right here and Mommy to stay right here, but sometimes I can't take pictures though, because Daddy and Mommy don't really like each other when they get really close because Daddy doesn't really like Mom. Well, he does when she puts lipstick on, but now she's not wearing it. What do you got? A flower. Oh, show me the flower. If Mommy and Daddy see this flower, they will never part. If they see this flower that I'm holding in my hand Mommy and Daddy will just do "like this!" And no one will ever see Daddy ever again. Well, we don't usually see him. Mmm! Wait a minute. Yuck! You know that girls don't have to wear lipstick to be pretty, right? - Yeah. Some girls don't wear any lipstick, and they're beautiful. I see! Look! A baby plant and a mommy plant! ♪ So long to mysterious ♪ So long to mysterious Jeremy, be gentle. It's my first time. Shouldn't it hurt more the first time? Isn't that how it works? - Were you drunk? - It's your shoulder. - Yeah, so? All right. Go check that out. - We're done? - Yeah. The suntan is really burning. Could you put that away for a little bit? Looks good. It's been going on since I saw you. - Okay. - I'm just saying. Memories, Jesse. Yeah, it's always- He's uncomfortable without it. Obviously. - I'm gonna smoke. - Okay. Bobby, how is a body like a back road? All the bumps and curves. Yeah, I know I'm pretty good at being a cameraman, huh? I know. I'll just tape. Unless she's documented domestic violence by calling the police or making a police report, she can't have him move. If she put his name on the house, it's his house. So, you know, figuring out how we can do that. Well, if she tells him, "You gotta take your name off the house." 'Cause if she would've filed, she would've had more, you know. I don't, I doubt very much that Jesse gave them the reason why her front teeth were broken and her bottom teeth. But I also know, and everyone else does too, that victims of domestic violence often don't report it. She gave up on changing her lifestyle, you know. Wake up, warm up! Wake up, warm up! Do you feel responsible for a lot of the things that have happened to Jesse? Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I feel real sad about that. I feel responsible too, because I was just such a cruel sibling. Mmhmm. Yeah. Most of the time, I don't know what to say. "I'm sorry" only works if the person can hear it or wants to hear it. The same goes for "I love you." Remember when I drove my wagon down the road? I don't know how far down the road I was, but I felt like I was miles away. And I stopped, and all of a sudden I couldn't see the house. I was, like, completely lost. So, I just stopped and stood there. And then I saw Mom come out to the road and yell, "Jesse!" Everybody thought I was dead or in the lake. We could do that. That'd be funny. I remember that like it was yesterday. We recreate this event together. We try to imagine ourselves as small bodies. It's in moments like this where I coax her to do something utterly ridiculous with me that I'm able to see her love. Who else would put up with this? Jesse! Look how he went for the sun. Found an opening and started leaning over in a different direction. Had a lot of years to do that. Oh, the ferns are growing right up between the keys. Well, it can't play anymore. There's gonna be a brand new trucking company coming in that's gonna help handle all the freight coming from the new Arauco plant. The whole town is gonna change. It's construction season. The roads are widening. And I'm trying to remember why exactly I drug us through this. Because you believed that the choices you've made render you unlovable. That the distance you enforced would protect you from suffering. That's just not true anymore. Then what questions have you left? ♪ Take us to the river ♪ Teach us to swim upstream ♪ You say, "Life ain't no fun, get used to the fight, ♪ 'cause yeah, those currents can be real mean..." ♪ I think most humans spend a good chunk of their lives trying to put distance between themselves and where they came from. Most literally, our mothers. One being separating into two is absolutely myth-worthy. Ask it! Tell it. I have to ask you something really challenging for me. And part of it's, I've wanted to ask you for a long time, but I haven't found the right moment to. There's just, like, one thing that sort of always is kind of a replay in my brain that I have to ask you about, that I'm hoping I can exorcise it. Which is that, when I... told you that I wanted to start taking hormones, you had sort of an emotional response and told me that me being trans was God punishing you for having had abortions before you had me. And I just wanna ask you if you still feel that way. I don't remember telling you that. I don't remember saying that. That was probably a grief response. And I love the person you are. And I'm sorry I said that. - Thank you. - Yeah. And hopefully, you can forgive me. Mom gave a talk one time in church. She talked about Jesse, and she talked about you. So, we all have things we have to adapt to. That was the crux of her talk was you have to, you love them the way they are, you know. That's the way it is. And if somebody doesn't like it that my daughter's transgender or the church doesn't agree with it, I've got a big problem with that. So, she's very, everybody liked that too, they... - Did she say that? - Yeah. Yep.

I learned a secret. When you speak the pain's name, it dissipates. When the pain's great, you have to speak it over and over and over again. I wanna go back into time and tell this secret to all of our former selves. Tell it to all your future selves instead. - What's that noise? - It's the squeaky chain. I don't ask many questions anymore. I just stay and watch small hands become larger hands. Hold my hand. Ready. Single-syllable words become multi. - Ready, Uncle Madsen? - Ready.
