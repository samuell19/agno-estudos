And as the years went on, she was filled with fear and sorrow. Are you still listening. Gracie? "She did not know if Odysseus was alive or dead." - Night, twinkle. - Night, daddy.

Four corners to my bed, four angels around my head. "One to watch, one to pray, two to keep my fears away." (ambient music) (birds chirping) (page flutters) (birds chirping) So then, uh... Mm. (eerie music) (insects chirping) (swing creaking) (eerie music continues) (Grace gasps) Jen, it's okay. You can still enjoy your summer. You'll be okay with the girls? You'll be good, right? She always is. I know. Look, we're gonna go. - Be safe. - We will. Don't worry. (door closes) Grace, say goodbye to your mum. Bye, mum. Have fun. Behave. Mummy, why are you putting on lipstick? You're not going on a date. Buckle up, girls. (puckers lips) (seatbelt clacks) (engine starting and revving) We are the Chelsea girls. (hands clapping) We wear our hair in curls. We wear our dungarees below our sexy knees. [Grace] How long does it take to get to Cornwall? Another four hours or so. Boring. See this girl, she used to get dragged down the stairs by a poltergeist at night. Are you reading that dreadful book again, Asta? It's spooky. It's gonna give you bad dreams. It won't. I love being scared. When I was about your age, your grandmother packed me off to boarding school. It was this big dark place. Hundreds of years old. It was easy to believe in ghosts when you were there. Did you ever see a ghost? Oh no, but we tried to. We would stand in front of the bathroom mirror at midnight, chanting, "Bloody Mary, Bloody Mary, Bloody Mary." (Kate chuckles) Oh, and we used to play the Ouija board too. Although, I didn't like that so much. Why not? Well, it would... What? Oh, everyone would get really carried away by what the glass spelled out when it moved. - What did it spell out? - Oh, nonsense, most of the time. But sometimes it would say really horrid things. And one girl, she got really frightened by what it said about her. What did it say? (eerie music) It was, it was really nasty. Pretty scary. She got very upset. Later on, she tried to hurt herself and had to leave the school. We got banned from playing it after that. Not that we wanted to anymore. Wow. Can we play that when we get to the cottage? I feel sick. Please, can we stop the car? (eerie music continues) (birds chirp and squawk) Oh my God. Can you move? (door closes) (keys jangling) - Mummy? - Yeah. We have to do that thing we always do. - What thing? - You know, thing with the herbs. Oh, the sage. Yeah, I packed some of that in here. - It's really cool. - Okay. What does it do? People say it cleanses houses of bad energy. - Bad energy? - It's like experiences and stuff. (sage crackling) Okay, here we go. Come on, you have to watch. There we are. Yeah. (blows) Okay? There you go. (whimsical music) You have to like do it all around the house to do it properly. Don't you think that's really cool? Uh. (wine pouring) - No. - Shut up. (screams) Mum! How did I get in here? I don't know. Hey, it's probably riddled with lice, Asta. I'll get a plastic bag. Give me that. (eerie music) (footsteps tapping) (insects chirping) What did they say it, it feels like? They say you feel kind of full. The boys in my school say that girls who get their periods smell of fish. Maybe. I don't really think about it yet. You know, kissing boys and sex stuff. Do you? I don't know. Sometimes I think I should, but I still don't. Mum says I will, though. She says it's like a light being switched on inside of you one day. What does your mum say? She doesn't like to talk about that sort of thing. (switch clicks) What if it wasn't a ghost? What do you mean? The Ouija board thing. What if it was like a demon? My book says they're different. Why? They follow you. They try and get inside of you. Hmm. (eerie music) (eerie music continues) I'm hungry, mummy. - How about this? - I don't like fruitcake. Well, sweetie, you're not the only one here. Grace doesn't like it either. No? Oh. (groceries rustling) That everything, love. Yeah, that's everything, love. (Asta chuckles) (coins jangling) Thanks. Come on girls. (girls giggling) (cashier whistling) (ambient music) Come on. This is the greenhouse. (indistinct chattering) (ambient music continues) (birds chirping) (girls giggle) Good, huh? (girls giggle) I think that in the olden days, druids used to live here. We learned about them last term. Druids? Yeah, and do you know what they used to do? They used to sacrifice people. - Why? - 'Cause they thought that the blood made God happy and that it got rid of their sins.

I'd die without you! I don't care. I'm leaving you anyway. (upbeat rock music) (Kate humming) (Kate laughing) Get out. Yep. Grace, you're doing it all wrong. - Asta. - I'm helping her. You're throwing your weight around. The slices need to be smaller. Oh, she's so bossy, isn't she? I'm not bossy. I just know how things are supposed to be done. Only two days till your birthday. - Yeah. - Only one more year left until you were a teenager, my love. - Mum. - Mm-hmm? Are you going to invite Daniel? No, Asta. I told you Daniel wasn't coming. Grace, mum dumped Daniel. He was jea... Let's not be mean about Daniel. He's still my very good friend. But it was you who said that- - Yes, well, never let someone compromise who you are as a person, girls. Remember that. - Can we have some wine? - No. You always let me have some. Hmm. You can have a tiny drop. - A glass. - A very small glass. Fairy size. Perfect. (wine pours) There you go. (glasses clink) (Kate chuckles) (upbeat rock music) (Kate laughing) You're going to get drunk now. - I'm not. - You are definitely not. This is you. Whatever. Oh, I'm pissed. (Kate chuckles) - I'm wasted. - Asta. You're so mature. Okay, my brave girl. Go and get some firewood. ♪ Wishing upon a star ♪ You having a good time, my darling? Yes, thank you. Thanks for having me. Oh, we love having you with us. It gets a bit boring, just the two of us all the time. (Grace chuckles) Did you want to call home at all? Mum won't mind. She's all right. My dad left my mum. You know, when I was about your age. Do you still speak to him? Well, it's hard chatting on the phone, isn't it? Yeah. (wood bangs) (Kate gasps) - Oh my God. - Asta! Pick that wood up and put it by the burner, please. I'm doing it. Oh my God, I saw something. - What do you mean? - There's something out there. I saw this thing when I was picking up the firewood. - That is enough, Asta. - It was a ghost. (suspenseful music) Just stop growing and stay like this forever, - my little one. - Okay, stop. Okay. Okay. (Grace sighs) "In a gloomy, hollow glen, she found a little cottage built of sticks and weeds in which a witch did dwell. (eerie music) A devil in female form, the succubus specialises in seducing men, "appearing in dreams and taking the form of a woman." Asta! Bath's ready! [Asta] Coming. Maybe it's a demon. Maybe it wants you. Maybe it followed you here all the way from London. You won't know it's a demon at first. They disguise themselves as something different, like a fox or maybe even a person. (eerie music continues) Grace. Listen, sweetheart. No, listen. Grace, come on. (eerie music continues) Daddy! (echoes) (eerie music continues) We're gonna put it at the front. To keep it cool. Okay. It's perfect. No, Gracie, that needs to go up there for it to stay upright. Oh. Right there. You see? Yeah. Okay. I'll tell you what, why don't you get some branches to fill up the gaps? Oh, and some flowers and stuff. We'll have a special christening, like a ceremony. Yeah. And I think it's really important that it's like attractive as well as functional. (eerie music) But like, I wouldn't play any of these games at home though. Not anymore. Would you? - We're not playing something. We're building something. But still. Yes, still. It's gonna be amazing though. We could even sleep in here. That'd be cool. Would your mum mind? Nah, but I don't think we should tell her just yet. Let's keep it as our thing. For now, at least. It's ours. (eerie music) (birds chirping) Have some more ingredients. That's not much. I know. It's suppose to be- Might need more. - Super healthy. And then we need to get a sprinkle of... (eerie music continues) (birds chirping) Smells like it a cigarette. I know. Mum. (girls whispering) (eerie music continues) Do you believe in past lives? Do you? I believe that we were sisters in our past life. That's why we're friends now because we're drawn to each other. I have this memory. It's like a dream, except it hasn't ever happened to me. What was it? I was a lady, all grown up. - Did you have babies? - Shut up. Listen, I was a lady by a lake. And it was morning. It was all misty. And I was strangling someone. A boy. (birds chirping) My son. And I loved him but I wanted to kill him. And the birds, they were singing in the back while I did it. [Both] We are the Chelsea girls. We wear our hair in curls. We wear our dungarees below our sexy knees. I met this boy one day. He gave me 50p to have it off with me. (suspenseful music) What's that? Who's that man? That's not a man. It's a demon in disguise. Run! (both panting) Wait, wait. We can't just let him have our fort. We have to go back. (suspenseful music continues) Come on. (both panting) (stones pattering) Ow! Grace. (rocks pattering) - Uh! - Come on. Ow! (groaning) Damn. We got him. Come on! (suspenseful music continues) (both panting) (beads jangling) - My beads! It doesn't matter now! Grace! - My beads. - Come on, we've got to go! (suspenseful music continues) (girl swallows) (glass clinks) (utensils scraping) Do you guys wanna go to Trebah Gardens tomorrow? Yes. That'd be lovely. Did you have fun today? Yeah. (utensil scraping) (Kate sighs) Nothing at all to share with your poor old mother? No, not really. You both look a bit sheepish to me. Asta? What, what did you do today, mummy? Oh, I read, I sketched a bit. Do you like being by yourself? Yeah. Yeah, it's, um, it's lovely. It's very relaxing.

If the weather's good, you can sleep outside without too much hassle. This is Sid, Grace. Nice to meet you, Grace. - Hi. - Sid has been camping nearby, but he hurt his head last night, so he's gonna be staying with us for a while. - For our whole holiday? - For as long as he likes. No, really. I don't wanna put you out and- - It's no problem. You're injured. You can't keep sleeping outside. - Are you homeless? - Asta, please. - It's okay, really. - I'm being curious. And there's nothing wrong with that. See? I'm not homeless. Well, not in the way you might think. Just been travelling around a bit. What are we doing today? We talked about Trebah Gardens. Are we going with him? Yes. - Yes? - Yeah. (upbeat rock music) (upbeat rock music continues) Wow, look. ♪ As we wait down by the river ♪ ♪ We're waiting for you to come ♪ Grace, it's cool. ♪ Waiting for a moment ♪ (indistinct chattering) ♪ You're ready to die ♪ I hope he doesn't tell your mum what we did. No, he won't. He wants to be our friend. Do you think your mom has met him before? What do you mean? It's just that she acts like she already knows him. (chuckles) No, she's like that with everyone. I guess she kind of likes helping people, looking after them. - Like with you. - Me? Why do you think you're here with us now? (upbeat rock music continues) Girls! Come and look at this! You okay? It's your big day tomorrow, sweetheart. - My birthday. - Really? - Happy birthday. - I'll be 12. [Kate] Oh, 12. - Seems like a lifetime ago. - An eternity. - Mum. - Yeah? Tell Sid about what happened when I was born. No, Sid doesn't wanna hear about that. No, tell me. Okay. (customers chattering) Well, we, Jan and I, were living in the Lake District. No shops, no neighbours, miles from anywhere. Anyway, the plan was that we would go and stay with friends closer to the hospital as I came up to my due date, but Asta, ever obliging, decided to show up early. - And that night? - Uh, and that night while I was in labour, there was an enormous storm. All the electrics went out. There were branches flying off trees. There was trees crashing into the road. There was absolutely no way to get to the hospital safely. Were you scared? I was absolutely terrified. I thought I was gonna bleed to death on the living room floor, but Jan, Jan was amazing. Jan is, uh, your husband? Oh no, we never married, but he, he kept me so calm and he helped me deliver my hurricane baby. My dad was a hero. [Sid] Sounds like it. (customers chattering) (eerie music) (car approaching) Come on, Sid. I wanna play football before it gets dark. (footsteps pattering) (eerie music) (birds chirping) (beads jangling) (Kate humming) (eerie music) For fuck's sake. Asta! Grace! Have you been drawing on the walls? You're really good at cooking. Well foster carer taught me. What about your parents? I had foster parents instead. Do you know anything about your real mum and dad? He died a long time ago. [Kate] You must have been very disturbed. Is that why you live in a tent then? 'Cause you don't have a mum or dad? (phone ringing) I bet that's your mum, Grace. I'm going to the toilet. Hello? Hey, Jenny, hi. Yeah, we're great. Hang on. I'll just get her for you. Grace! That is your mum! Come say hi! She's having a wee. Oh, I think she's in the loo actually Jenny, but how are you? (receiver clacks) (cries) I keep thinking she'll leave home. And then this is what it'll be like. All the time. Oh, Jen. You'll get over this, over him. And Gracie will be back with you soon. I know. I know. (Jenny sniffs and sighs) You must think I'm pathetic. Of course I don't, Jenny. You're my friend. I think you're brilliant and beautiful and clever and strong. 26 years. I know. Oh, I'm still trying to work it out. I mean, what came over him? It's like he was taken over by something and something that wasn't him. Maybe the trick right now is not to try and understand it, but just keep going. Look, I'm so sorry, but I've got to go, Jen. Dinner's nearly ready. Ring tomorrow. Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, of course. I'm sorry. Okay, bye. Goodbye. (soft dramatic music) (utensils clinking) You don't have to finish if you've had enough too, Grace. No, I want to. See, Grace eats everything on her plate. (Grace chuckles) - Cooe, Kate! - It's Jane. - Jane, how lovely! - Hello, darlings! Oh, I thought it was you two staying. And I saw your car a couple of days ago. How are you? We're good. This is Grace. I've known her since I was two. Oh my goodness. Hello, Grace. Hi. Mm, sorry. This is Sid. Sid's a new friend. He's staying with us. - Good to meet you, Sid. - You too. Can I get you a glass of wine, Jane? - Yes, please. - Red, is it? Oh, lovely, lovely. [Asta] You're just in time for pudding. Oh, am I now? So what have you lot been up to? Um, nothing much. We've just been driving around and playing football. Oh, well sounds very nice indeed. Asta, will you get the pudding, please? (wine pouring) So Grace, how are you finding Cornwall? It's lovely. Very clean. (chuckles) It's been wonderful having Grace here. And Sid arrived yesterday. We are very happy to have him here. (dishes clacking) Merry little bunch, indeed. Who would like ice scream? Sid? Yeah. Cool, thanks. (utensils clinking) You know I do. Mm-hmm. I haven't asked you yet, madam. (Sid chuckles) Sid, there you go. - Grace? - No, thank you. - No? - But you love ice cream. I don't really want any. It's fattening. (chuckles) As if you need to worry about that. Mm, my dad says no one thinks fat girls are sexy. They disgust people. (utensils clink) Okay. No ice cream for Grace then. Jane? Yes please, darling. Thank you. (bowl and utensils clinking) (water splashing) (sponge squeaking) Hi, girls. (lighter clicking) Thanks. That was funny, hey? So he just turned up outta nowhere? Shh, shh, shh. He's coming back in a minute. - Kate. - God, okay. He was camping. He hurt his head. (rain pattering) Uh, I wanted to be a Good Samaritan. But you know nothing about him. (lighter clicks) - Yeah, but he's nice, isn't he? (chuckles) Well, yes, but, (sighs) anyone can be nice if they want to be seen that way. Come on, darling. You have the girls with you. Have you been, Sid? - To India? - Mm. - No. - Oh, you must. Some of the best years of my life. I was travelling around with a couple from Cardiff. I mean, they were lovely people, but quite mad. She was into Reiki and everything. In fact, that's how I got into it. Mm, Jane's a wonderful healer. She's got magic hands. (Jane chuckles) Show Grace your tarot, Jane. Ah, well I have actually brought my cards with me 'cause I know you love a reading. - What's tarot? - She can tell your future with these special playing cards. Would you like a reading, Grace? What would you be able to see? You'll have to wait and see. Do it. It's really cool. I don't know. You don't have to. I think all that stuff's rubbish anyway. No point messing around with it. - Really? - Not if you don't want to. (cards clattering) Actually, Sid, some of us find that rubbish a very enriching part of our lives. Darling, would you mind pouring me another glass of wine please? Oh, come on. Telling your future with cards. It isn't real. (scoffs) What an incredibly shortsighted thing to say. What, because you can't see or touch something, it isn't real? Because you don't understand it, it's not real? There are a great many things out there that are far, far beyond our understanding, and they're as real as you and me. And they tell you that themselves, if you just bothered to listen to or see the signs. - The signs? - Oh, God, no. - Yes, the signs, Sid. The signs are everywhere. In funny little coincidences, in dreams, in weird weather, strange tragedies, random acts of kindness, in trees, animals. (chuckles) It's just hippie crap. Isn't it? Oh, come trust a man to say that, Sid. Women are far, far more intuitive, more sensitive about these things, always have been, always will be. (fire crackling) Grace? All right then. - Come on. - Okay. (Jane exhales) Now is there anything you would like to ask the cards, Grace? Anything you would like to find out? Um, no. I don't think so. (Jane exhales) (fire crackling) This is Grace, this is Grace. Now Grace, you pick the cards yourself. That means whatever comes out is about you and you alone. Do you see? Now cut the deck with your left hand. That's your unconscious hand. Lovely. Now pick a card. Pick a card. Any card. Shh. Asta. (Jane sighs) La lune. The moon. Interesting. Now pick another card. (card scraping) The lovers. That means you're in love, Gracie. - It does not. - Shh. All in good time. Pick another card, Grace. Fascinating. Let it in, Grace. (picture frame bangs) (Asta screams) Jesus. (Kate laughs) Keep your hair on, everybody. It's just a loose nail. That's all. (eerie music) You promise you didn't do it? No, I told you. Did you? Of course not. So, how did it get here? (eerie music continues) I don't know. It was probably here before we got here. It wasn't. There's something weird in this house. Can't you feel it? (chuckles) Maybe you're the weird one, Gracie. (eerie music continues) (eerie music continues) (objects clattering) (pages fluttering) (suspenseful music) (Kate gasps) (intense music) (Sid sobbing) (soft guitar music) Is she coming? - Yeah? - I think so. (footsteps approaching) (Kate laughing) - This is ace! Isn't it wonderful? Sid did it for you. - Happy birthday. - Thank you. Happy birthday, darling.

(ambient music) (crickets chirping) (bag rustling) (ambient music continues) Asta, wake up. - What time is it? - Come on. Let's go to the woods. I wanna say a special goodbye to our fort. (Asta sighs) (crickets chirping) (suspenseful music) (footsteps pattering) Come on. It's gonna be fine. What's in there? Just some stuff. I thought we could have a goodbye ceremony. (lighter clicking) Why are we lighting them? I told you, so we can have a goodbye ceremony. (suspenseful music) Light? (owl hooting) (bag rustling) (sticks clattering) (fire crackling) Now we have to offer some things to the fire. Like what? Oil. And wine. (cork pops) To bless it. (oil and wine pouring) (suspenseful music continues) (suspenseful music continues) The fire is ready. You'll say goodbye first. How? By putting this on. I don't... Come on. It's important. I'll go after. (suspenseful music continues) O Lord Jesus Christ, forgive my sins. - What's that? - O Lord Jesus Christ, forgive my sins. Sage. To cleanse the air so we can say goodbye properly. What are you doing now? (intense music) Grace? (knife scrapes) I don't wanna play anymore. Jesus Christ, forgive my sins. Jesus Christ, forgive my sins. O Lord Jesus Christ, forgive my sins. Jesus Christ, forgive my... - Oh, there you are. What are you doing? - Hi. - All right? I saw your light. What's all this? Who are you? Robbie. Didn't Kate tell you about me? I invited her to my mate's party. There's still time if you guys wanna come now. When did you meet my mum? (chuckles) She's a bit young to be her mom. She's not Kate. Yes, she is. Hey, where, where'd you go earlier? - Don't touch her! - I wasn't, hey, it was, it was nice earlier. We, we could have fun tonight. Come on. I, I like you. - I don't want to! - Where are you going? Grace! Grace, come back! - Kate, Grace, whatever. Come on, don't be a twat. (Grace panting) - Grace! (suspenseful music continues) (Grace panting) Hey! Hey, wait! Kate! There you are. Got ya. (Grace biting) (Robbie screams) (body slams) - Grace! - Should call the police. No, not yet. - Grace! - Grace! Gracie! (soft dramatic music) (Kate sobbing) (birds chirping) Grace! Grace! Where have you been? Where the hell have you... Are you all right? Where have you been? Where's that man? He left. For the life of the flesh is in the blood. And I have given it to you to make an atonement for my soul. For it is the blood that makes an atonement for the soul. (soft dramatic music) She is not okay. She needs guidance. She needs help. She needs someone to look after her properly. [Sid] Maybe, yeah, but I, I don't think you're the one to do it. - What do you mean? - Nothing. No, no. What do you mean? [Sid] Just that you treat people like these broken things that need to be fixed. It's not that easy for some kids. (soft dramatic music) I'm sorry.
