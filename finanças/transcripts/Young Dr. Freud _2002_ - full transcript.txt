He grappled with the enemy within on the battlefield of the mind. Freud. He has things to say which are extremely subversive. He was a bourgeois who made bombs in his living room. But Freud had demons of his own. He suffered from episodic depressions. He was very worried about dying. He was in a troubled state. His ideas revolutionized the way we think and feel about ourselves. This program was made possible in part by a grant from: and by contributions to your PBS station from: On October 23, 1896, 80-year-old Jacob Freud died in Vienna. His son, Sigmund, was deeply shaken. I find it difficult to write just now. The old man's death has affected me profoundly. With his peculiar mixture of deep wisdom and fantastic lightheartedness, he had a significant effect on my life. I now feel quite uprooted. My father's death revolutionized my soul. By the time he died, his life had long been over, but in my inner self, the whole past has been reawakened. Freud's childhood came rushing back, flooding him with disturbing dreams and half-forgotten memories... And out of the tumult, he would fashion a theory that would change forever the way we think and feel about ourselves. All the key concepts of human psychology have been with us since the ancient world, but nobody before Freud took this kind of wisdom, systematized it and offered alleviation of human suffering on the basis of it. Uh, that was totally, uh, new. Freud believed that the human being is an animal in conflict. We are not masters of our own house. Much of our life is determined by unconscious forces that we don't know about. It's a frightening, uh, notion. It flies in the face of all our wishes to have our free will affirmed, our rationality affirmed. Unconscious wishes, slips of the tongue, repressed impulses... He gave us a language for our fears and dreams, our deeply held secrets, our darkly imagined nightmares. We're blas√© about it now, because Freud's thinking has become part of the very language we use: "You're being defensive," "You're rationalizing," uh... or "You're conflicted about that." His insights into the ways in which our minds are divided, the ways in which we are at war with ourselves, change our very conception of human nature and of the nature of mind. Freud spent his life, as he once put it, "struggling with the demon," the demon of irrationality, but everything he believed grew from the discoveries he made as a young man before the turn of the 20th century, when he learned that to grapple with the demons inside others, he would have to wrestle with his own.

With a booming population and a dazzling array of new public buildings, as the 19th century drew to a close, the ancient city was bursting with pride and confidence. Sigmund Freud grew up in Vienna, the eldest of seven children. He knew its splendid palaces and modern boulevards, its markets and parks... but he ignored its festive air and effervescent gaiety. While others dreamed of champagne and waltzes, young Freud dreamed of fame. In 1877, Sigmund Freud was an ambitious 21-year-old who planned to devote his life to science. The man who would one day explore the tumultuous world of the mind... Desires, dreams, anxieties, wishes... Began by studying the anatomy of the brain. As a student at the University of Vienna, he published well-argued scientific papers with cautious conclusions, illustrated by his own painstaking drawings. His professor was one of the most famous scientists of his day, Ernst Wilhelm von Bruecke. With his piercing blue eyes and penetrating intellect, Bruecke was a formidable figure... "the greatest authority," Freud wrote, "I ever met." 40 years Freud's senior, Bruecke was the first of a series of men whom Freud would revere and emulate before striking out in his own direction. Bruecke was very tough on the medical students who worked with him, very demanding. Freud felt a sense of admiration as well as a good deal of fear... The way you might feel about a very intelligent, very demanding father. Bruecke insisted on careful observation, experimentation and physical or chemical explanations of biological phenomena. For Bruecke, the intangible feelings and thoughts of the mind were hidden within the brain's gelatinous tissue. Even the mind could be reduced to physical laws. The main thing that the young Freud learned in Bruecke's laboratory is that nothing is valid which cannot be put into strict laws of physics and chemistry. That is the whole wish... To reduce the human being to the laws of science. Freud would struggle for years to go beyond what he learned in Bruecke's laboratory, to develop a theory of the mind that was not based on the biology of the brain. There would always be a battle within him... The scientist in him and the visionary. He always wanted to be regarded as a scientist, but his conclusions very often go beyond science. When Freud was 26, his commitment to laboratory science came to an end. 21-year-old Martha Bernays was peeling an apple when Freud first saw her. Soon he was sending her red roses every day and calling her "Princess." Within two months, they were engaged. My precious, most beloved girl. I knew it was only after you had gone that I would recognize the full extent of my happiness. I still cannot grasp it. And if that sweet little picture were not lying in front of me, I would think it was all a beguiling dream. BERNAYS: Sigi, my Sigi. Today for the first time I call you by your name. My darling, I am happy, yes, happy as I have never been in my long life. But Freud was too poor to marry Martha. A penniless student still living at home, he could hardly support a wife and family. My sweet girl, it only pains me to think I should be so powerless to prove my love for you. In front of me sizzle the gas bubbles which I have to filter. The whole thing spells resignation, waiting. With no real prospect of ever earning a livelihood from his scientific work, desperate to marry Martha, Freud made a painful decision. Just six months after he met her, he sacrificed his scientific ambitions for the woman he loved. He decided to become a doctor. Bruecke takes him aside and says to him, "Look here, young man, you can't make a living this way." If Bruecke had been able to pay his wages, you and I would have never heard of him. Freud would spend three lonely years at Vienna General Hospital, trying his hand at surgery, internal medicine, psychiatry, not knowing which might become his specialty. He rarely saw Martha now. She had moved with her family to Hamburg in northern Germany, far from Vienna. Restless, he read late into the night... Cervantes, Goethe, Shakespeare... And every day wrote Martha long, passionate letters. My beloved Marti, these difficult times will not discourage me. I know how sweet you are, how you can turn a house into a paradise. My beloved, sweet Sigi, why can't we be together? I could not sleep half the night. Your dear and noble image was before me and my longing for you was so intense. She was his first love and he was extremely ardent. Fair mistress, sweet love, do you realize that it is two whole days since I heard from you? It is such a sweet feeling to make something for you. And that I am beginning to worry. The night before last, I dreamt continuously of you. Could you be ill or angry with me? I only fear that you are too passionately involved in your work. I have to fight the sensation of being a monk in a cell. When a letter from you arrives, life enters. I am so much in the mood to hear you talk and to close your mouth every now and again with a kiss to make you stop. He's jealous, demanding. He wants her not to go skating with so and so and she's not supposed to see somebody else. Who was boss was very obvious from the very beginning. Maybe one of the things that attracted him and kept him attracted was that she was willing to go along. I want to be the way you want me to be. Just love me a little, a little passionately. You kiss so wonderfully. Cover me with love. While Freud studied medicine, he continued his own research, hoping for some important discovery. When he began experimenting with a poorly understood drug, he was convinced he would soon win fame, fortune and make Martha his wife. We need no more than one stroke of luck to consider setting up house. I have been reading about cocaine. Cocaine was a powerful painkiller, but Freud learned that it also acted on depression. He complains of depression and of low energy level. Freud did not anticipate cocaine's very, very strong addictive qualities. He finds this magical substance which elevates his mood, which gives him enormous energy, and he feels like he has discovered the elixir of life. In my last severe depression I took coca again and a small dose lifted me to the heights. Freud published a paper on cocaine and prescribed it for himself, his patients, his friends. He even sent some to Martha, to make her strong, he wrote her, and give her cheeks a red color. When other scientists discovered cocaine's addictive powers, Freud's hopes for success and fortune quickly vanished. Although he would turn to cocaine occasionally over the next years, he never became addicted and eventually stopped using the drug altogether. In the fall of 1885, impatient with what he could learn in Vienna, Freud traveled to Paris. He had won a scholarship to study with one of the greatest neurologists of his day. At the height of his fame, Jean Charcot was called "the Napoleon of Neuroses." "Charcot," Freud wrote Martha, "is a man whose common sense borders on genius." Charcot was a compelling, charismatic man, and Freud was always attracted to compelling, charismatic men. The turning point for Freud really was his year in Paris and the work with Charcot. Charcot would introduce the young medical student to a mystery he would spend the rest of his life trying to fathom: the power of mental forces hidden away from conscious awareness. Many of Charcot's patients suffered from a bizarre array of physical and emotional problems, symptoms of a puzzling affliction doctors called "hysteria." There are medical texts that describe hysteria, from stuttering and facial tics to major motor symptoms... Arching backwards in a bed, total rigidity of the body, swooning away and losing consciousness, inability to swallow, numbness. So they would do a battery of tests and they would come up with the conclusion that there was no organic cause. Somebody would be paralyzed one day and the next day they would get up out of bed and be fine and then several days later, the paralysis returns. That is not an organic paralysis. The cause of hysteria was unknown. Unable to find a physical explanation, medical doctors were frustrated, often curtly accusing their patients of faking. An hysterical woman is almost as certain to be treated as a malingerer, as in earlier centuries she would have been certain to be judged and condemned as a witch or as possessed of the devil. Charcot placed the whole weight of his authority on the side of the genuineness and objectivity of hysterical phenomena. The common wisdom was that hysteria was a disease for which there was no cure. They would put them in a psychiatric hospital in a ward, and that was the end of them. It was a death sentence, this diagnosis, and to think in terms of being able to cure hysterics was really radical. Hysterics used to be the despair of the physician. Freud at one point said, "When a patient is a hysteric "and the doctor finishes examining him, "there is no change in the patient, but there is a marked change in the doctor." The riddle of hysteria excited Freud's curiosity. If he could reveal its unknown cause, he might gain the recognition he had long hoped would be his. Charcot treated hysteria with hypnosis. Under his hypnotic spell, his patients would follow his suggestions and a paralysis would disappear, a tic subside, only to reappear later when the trance faded. Here is this great, you know, French physician, with a great reputation indeed, who uses hypnotism. Hypnotism was the kind of thing that you did at fairs, games that you played with the gullible. This was a very unrespectable thing to do. Freud was struck by Charcot's forceful demonstration of the mind's power, even over the body itself. It was the recognition that there's a depth to mind and layers of consciousness and unconsciousness at play. This was an enormous insight for Freud, because it was the first inkling that the mind was not transparent. Freud had arrived in Paris fascinated by problems of the brain. Five months later he returned to Vienna, intrigued by problems of the mind. That spring, in a small office in the heart of the city, he began to practice medicine, specializing in neurology, treating patients with both physical and nervous disorders. At last, he was able to scrape together enough money to make Martha his wife. On September 14, 1886, after four years of waiting, 30-year-old Sigmund Freud married the only woman he would ever love. I am finding it all most strange, my utter effrontery in getting married and setting myself up as a man who can do anything he likes. But the Bodensee is frozen over, and my happy heart is leaping gaily across it. Martha quickly became the kind of wife Freud had hoped for, busy with home and family. Martha produced six children in a little over nine years. She was constantly pregnant. She was a very good hausfrau. She was very thrifty. My father would say that his mother would rather poison the whole household than throw food away. Freud became a man of regular habits. He had his moustache and beard trimmed daily by his barber, strolled the boulevard each day and played cards with the same group of friends every Saturday night. Five foot seven, faultlessly dressed, he loved a good cigar... He smoked more than 20 a day. As Freud began his work as a neurologist, he continued to be puzzled by the riddle of hysteria. Like other doctors of his day, he treated hysteria with discreetly delivered jolts of electricity. My therapeutic arsenal contained only two weapons: hypnotism and electrotherapy. Unluckily, I was soon driven to see that electrotherapy was of no help whatever. Bewildered, searching for a more effective treatment, Freud turned for advice to a new mentor, a brilliant physician who had also been experimenting with hypnotism. Josef Breuer was a highly regarded doctor with a thriving practice. Nearly 15 years older, Breuer had befriended Freud when Freud was still a student, lent him money, shared his ideas. The two men grew so close that Freud named his oldest daughter after Breuer's wife. Breuer had once shared with Freud the story of one of his patients, a young woman he would later call, to guard her identity, "Anna O." Anna O. was very beautiful. She was unusually clever... and as a patient, she was enough to keep anybody busy. Her real name was Bertha Pappenheim, a 21-year-old with what Breuer described as a "highly poetic temperament." Freud never met her, but Breuer's account of her treatment helped convince him that hysteria was connected to the slumbering imagination. The patient had been a young girl of unusual education and gifts, who had fallen ill while she was nursing her father, to whom she was fondly devoted. As her father grew weaker, Bertha rarely left her room, except to sit by his bedside. In her distress, she developed increasingly bizarre symptoms: a nervous cough, headaches, blurred vision, paralysis in an arm or leg... hallucinations. Terrified by the thought of her father's death, she conjured up images of fear and mortality. Overwhelmed, she turned to Breuer for help. Breuer put her into a hypnotic trance. Breuer arrived at a new method of treatment. He made her tell him what it was that was oppressing her mind and the symptom disappeared. The thought of her father's death and her passionate love for him had been too much for Bertha to bear. Hypnosis, Breuer discovered, seemed to free her to explore her suffering. Bertha described talking to Breuer as "chimney sweeping." When she talked freely and he encouraged her, the symptoms would disappear. They might come back, and then you did it again and they would go away. It's something that was unheard of... That you might get rid of certain symptoms by talking them out. There is a thought that is so unacceptable to her that she has to banish it from consciousness. But even though it's banished, it does its dirty work anyway in producing symptoms. Hysterical symptoms are linked to specific traumatic events that have been not accessible to normal states of consciousness. Therefore you hypnotize the person, put them in a state where they can gain access to these traumatic memories and they disappear. That was the rationale for Breuer's treatment. From the case of Anna O., Freud learned that recapturing the past promised hope for the future. Bertha was the first person to experience what she herself called the "talking cure." After further struggle, Bertha's symptoms subsided. One day she would become an ardent feminist and a pioneer social worker. In 1891, on Freud's 35th birthday, his father gave him the family Bible to remind his son of his Jewish heritage. "My dear son," Jacob wrote in Hebrew, "go, read. "There will be open to you "the sources of wisdom, knowledge and understanding. From your father, who loves you with unending love." But Jewish rites and rituals had no appeal to Freud. He had not been raised as an observant Jew. He celebrated Christmas every year, complete with candlelit trees and presents for the children. Freud didn't accept Judaism as a religion. He was a nonbelieving Jew, but there's no doubt that he fully identified, had the identity of a Jew. For centuries, central European Jews had lived in fear of murder and massacre, oppressed by cruel social and economic injustices. By the time Freud was 11, they had been given the rights of other citizens, but anti-Semitism persisted, and Freud was never unaware of it. Freud's marginality as a Jew played a role in his developing his ideas, because it's standing back, and rather than being absorbed and taking for granted cultural norms and cultural assumptions and beliefs, he's critiquing them, he's questioning them, he's challenging them. He knew that he was very bright. He knew that about himself, and he was going to prove to the world that he... that a Jew could become a great man. By the fall of 1891, Freud was earning just enough money to move to a new apartment in the heart of Vienna. For nearly five decades this would be his home. Here in the small office adjoining his apartment, he would receive his patients and do the work that would at last bring him the fame he always believed would be his. As a young researcher, Freud had dissected the brain and studied its anatomy under a microscope. Now he would study the mind and attempt to penetrate its mysteries with the scalpel of his own intellect. At first, like Breuer, Freud hypnotized his patients, encouraging them to tell him their stories while under a hypnotic trance... but hypnosis wasn't helping them. In a hypnotic trance people would talk about things that they couldn't talk about, wouldn't talk about under other circumstances, and that could help, but it wasn't lasting. People would have momentary cures under hypnosis and then lapse right back into their illness again. Gradually Freud abandoned hypnosis altogether. Instead, he urged his patients to shut their eyes. He applied the pressure of his hands to their foreheads... Anything to get them to tell him what they remembered. Nothing worked. Then he hit upon a technique that became the cornerstone of his treatment. He simply asked his patients to talk. He would listen, encouraging them to let their thoughts drift, to free-associate. That's how free association was born. All he asked for is that the patient pledge himself to say everything. It may be boring, it may be repetitious, it may make you feel silly and you may be ashamed to believe something or other. It may be very dirty, it may be criminal... doesn't matter. Freud transformed the passive hypnotic patient... To whom people were giving suggestion... Into a source of information. Charcot actually commanded his patients to get well; Freud inquired. That was a huge revolution. If a patient is... suffers from hysteria, and you want to know why, you asked. Freud saw himself as a kind of archaeologist, digging deeper and deeper into the buried past, and prided himself on the antiquities he collected throughout his life, displaying them in his consulting room. I like to compare my procedure with the technique of excavating a buried city, clearing away the pathogenic psychical material layer by layer. From fragments of the past, he struggled to interpret the present. His statues stood as emblems of the instinctual life itself. Freud learns that people seem to be guided by forces over which they don't have really complete control, and he begins to develop this idea that maybe this unconscious is worth studying in a more systematic way than it's ever been. What his patients said mattered. Everything was important, even their dreams. Men and women had always wondered at dreams, imagined them as hidden messages, feared them as mysterious omens, invested them with prophetic powers. Doctors in Freud's day dismissed dreams as irrelevant nonsense, but Freud was curious. Somebody else could have passed dreams by. This was one of those genius ideas. Everybody dreams, so this was the huge step from a medical specialty to a discovery that matters to everyone. If you take the simple hypothesis that dreaming is a continuation of thinking in the sleeping state, then looking at your dreams may well be a way of understanding your preoccupations, your concerns, what you're most upset by, what you're most preoccupied by, that may not be that easily accessible when you're talking to me awake. Every summer, Freud fled the heat of Vienna to vacation with his family in the Alps. He loved hiking the mountain trails with his children, gathering the wild flowers and identifying the mushrooms dotting the alpine meadows. There was one place he liked best, his son Martin later wrote, a lake high in the Koenigssee. Freud and his children enjoyed riding the ferry, especially when the steersman fired an ancient pistol... sending reverberations echoing from mountain wall to mountain wall. But even on vacation, he never stopped trying to unravel the mystery of hysteria, which had by now become an obsession. I was sitting deep in contemplation of the charm of the distant prospect, so lost in thought that at first I did not connect it with myself when these words reached my ears: "Are you a doctor, sir? "You wrote your name in the visitors' book in the inn. The truth is, sir, my nerves are bad." Freud looked up and saw an 18-year-old girl asking for help. When he wrote about her later, he called her "Katerina." When she recounted her ailments... Shortness of breath, dizziness, a crushing feeling in her chest, a choking in her throat... Freud was convinced that she suffered from hysteria. Her symptoms first appeared, she told Freud, when she discovered her father having sex with her sister. She was frightened, she said, because her father had attempted to force her to have sex with him two years before, when she was just 14. She obviously developed trust in Freud or she had the need to talk, but she talked relatively easily. At the end of these memories, she came to a stop. She was like someone transformed. The sulky, unhappy face had grown lively. Her eyes were bright. She was lightened and exalted. You'd be amazed how helpful it can be to somebody who's undergone any kind of rape experience or molestation experience and never been able to tell the tale, to tell it. But we know now that more needs to be done. She told him this story, so he thought that now that she confessed it to him, that's it. Freud considered her cured, but this is not an analysis. Freud's idea at that time was that you are hysteric because you repress something. The mere act of making it conscious is the cure. The transformation from one realm... the unconscious... Into another realm... The conscious... is curative. That was Freud's original idea. Later on he learned better. Freud was still groping. He had helped Katerina, but he only vaguely understood how. Later he would learn that to help someone takes more than insight, that there was much more to healing than solving a puzzle. It's the beginning of a whole journey that will take on increasing complexity. At that time he was operating on a simple idea: You make something conscious. I hope this girl derives some benefit from our conversation. I have not seen her since. If someone were to assert that the present case history is not so much an analyzed case of hysteria as a case solved by guessing, I should have nothing to say against him. Freud and Breuer elaborated their ideas in professional journals and finally in a book, Studies in Hysteria. But their collaboration and their friendship was coming to an end over a highly charged issue. Whatever case and whatever symptom we take as our starting point, in the end, we infallibly come to the realm of sexual experience. Freud kept noting the sexual material peeping out from behind the symptoms of his patients. In an era when sexuality was a forbidden subject, Freud grew convinced that the cause of hysteria lay not just with any early traumatic experience, but with early traumatic sexual experience. Respectable people in the 19th century were very squeamish about the matter of sexuality. They didn't talk about it. If they talked about it at all, they used euphemisms. They went into marriage uninformed. This was a kind of unacceptable subject, and Freud argues that what's unacceptable will then be repressed... It will be put into that invisible compartment in your mind... And this is something that Freud thought Breuer had failed to see. "The plunging into sexuality, in theory and practice," Breuer wrote, "is not to my taste." He did not accept Freud's theory, and, I suspect, with good reason. He's more careful. He's, uh... needs more data. He's, uh, more cautious. Breuer objected that Freud had collapsed the complex lives of his patients into one sweeping theme... Sexuality. Freud's scientific training was to look for the single cause behind a multiplicity of phenomena, which could produce reductive explanations. The single-minded attention to sexual desire did obscure other desires, but you have to be single-minded when you are going against great forces of opposition and... and centuries of different understanding and you are trying to lever your way into something novel. Freud's theory is a very frightening one. It's very frightening to think that people are as moved around by their sexual desire as Freud held them to be. The collaboration between Freud and Breuer was over, the bond between the two men broken, never to be mended. The development of psychoanalysis cost me his friendship. It was not easy for me to pay such a price, but I could not escape it. This is the beginning of a long pattern of getting very close to and even worshiping a man and then having to break from him. Freud wants a strong male figure to worship. He needs the great man to idealize and identify with, and then he... goes way beyond them. By the middle of the 1890s, Freud was increasingly isolated from his colleagues, pursuing his research on his own, certain he was on the way to a discovery that would make him famous. I am pretty well alone here in tackling the neurosis, regarded rather as a monomaniac, while I have the distinct feeling that I have touched on one of the great secrets of nature. Settled comfortably in the routines of daily life, he was consumed by his work. But the ardor had disappeared from his marriage. It was a very ordinary life... of a professional and his wife and family. Martha was very tolerant of the idea that he worked late into the night. She took care of the kids and he did the work and that was it. Her role was to keep the household going and make that all possible. We have wonderful courting letters before marriage, but after marriage, we only get laundry letters... It's all practical. We don't have a single love letter after marriage. With no one to talk to about his radical ideas, Freud saved his passionate outpourings for a new friend. Wilhelm Fliess was an ear, nose and throat specialist from Berlin, a reputable doctor with a large practice. Of all the men Freud looked to for understanding, sympathy and support, Fliess appears the oddest choice. Fliess had theories of his own... very strange kind of connection between the nose and sexual feelings. If you were to read Freud and Fliess at that time, you wouldn't know which of them or whether both of them were crazy. Freud was desperately alone, and what Freud did was to write down and send to Fliess everything that occurred to him. Freud always regarded Fliess as superior to him. How much I owe you... Solace, understanding, stimulation in my loneliness, meaning to my life. It is primarily through your example that intellectually I gained the strength to trust my judgment. For all that, accept my humble thanks. I know that you do not need me as much as I need you. If you read some of the letters to Fliess, they sound almost as romantic as his letters to Martha. He clearly was a sounding board for Freud. The need to have a figure to confide in, admire, even idealize, is probably especially poignant and intense when you're charting uncharted territory and think that you have broken through, made important discoveries but are not quite sure. So you find someone who you respect and admire and you share some of these ideas with them. I think only about the neurosis, but I have to rely solely upon myself, which is why progress is slow. I have spent the hours of the night from 11:00 to 2:00 with such fantasizing... Overworked, irritated, confused... Stopped only when I came up against an absurdity... I have a whole series of the most peculiar things I could tell you... Hysteria is a consequence of presexual sexual shock... The need for you increases greatly... I keep collecting material... Your praise is nectar and ambrosia for me... I am overflowing with new ideas... It will still be a long time before you can ask me about results. Freud was investigating his own memories and dreams now, his moods swinging wildly between elation and despair. I thought I had the secret already... The origin of neurosis pursues me everywhere... Now I know I don't have it yet; I am still all mixed up. He suffered from episodic depressions. Everything fine except for the three-day migraine. He had all kinds of heart arrhythmias. Shooting pains down the left arm, burning in the heart region, constant tension, pressure... He was very worried about dying. I would like so much to hold out until 51. He had all kinds of expectations of the date for his own death. But I had one day that made me feel it was unlikely. He was in a troubled state. I feel aged, sluggish, not healthy. I shall go on suffering for another four to eight years and then between 40 and 50 perish very abruptly from a rupture of the heart. For years Freud worked alone, sharing his theories with no one but Fliess. Then, two weeks before his 40th birthday, he felt confident enough to risk revealing his radical ideas. Gentlemen, imagine that an explorer arrives in a little-known region where his interest is aroused by an expanse of ruins. He may content himself with what lies exposed to view, but he may have brought picks, shovels and spades to uncover what is buried. We try in a similar way to make the symptoms of hysteria bear witness to the history of the origin of the illness. In a lecture at the Viennese Society for Psychiatry and Neurology, Freud presented his theory of the origin of hysteria to his skeptical colleagues. I put forward the thesis that at the bottom of every case of hysteria there are one or more occurrences of premature sexual experience, occurrences which belong to the earliest years of childhood. The infantile traumas must be described without exception as grave sexual injures, some of them absolutely appalling. Hysteria, Freud argued, was caused by the sexual assault on an innocent child. He's on novel territory and very, very difficult territory to think about... The seduction of children by adults. It's not like there's a huge literature sitting out there about this. No one talked about this. So to... to piece his way through it and try to... to understand what might be fantasy, what might be fact, what might be distorted memory, repressed memory, these very, very complicated issues, hard to understand even after a hundred years of work on it. I have now come to the end of what I have to say today, prepared to meet with contradiction and disbelief. What is even more important to me than the value you put on my results is the attention you give to the procedure I have employed... A new method which gives wide access to processes of thought which have remained unconscious. I cannot believe that psychiatry will long hold back from making use of this new pathway to knowledge. Freud's colleagues rejected his theory. One of them called it a scientific fairy tale. His theory is totally unacceptable. The people who listened to it are indifferent, amused, horrified. Convinced that he had solved the mystery of hysteria, Freud was profoundly disappointed. He celebrated his 40th birthday still suffering from migraine headaches, fears of an early death and spells of depression. At that time I had reached the peak of loneliness. No one paid any attention to me, and the only thing that kept me going was a bit of defiance. That summer, Freud's father, Jacob, fell ill. Four months later, Jacob died. On the day of the funeral I was kept waiting at the barbershop and therefore arrived at the house of mourning late. The family was displeased with me, somewhat offended by my lateness. That night, Freud had a dream. I was in a place where there was a sign: "You are requested to close the eyes." I recognized the place as the barbershop I visit every day. Freud was by now convinced that dreams held a key to unlocking the secrets of the mind. His dream on the night of his father's funeral concealed a clue to his own troubled state. The dream obviously refers to something that he didn't want to look at. If Freud were my patient and he would present me the dream, I would say to him, "Is there something about your father that you would rather not look at?" Freud was deeply disturbed by his father's death, gripped by an intellectual and spiritual crisis. I am unable to take any pleasure in living. Once more I experienced a temporary intensification of cardiac pains. The death of his father filled him with feelings that he didn't understand. Before his father died, one gets the impression of a man who's on a kind of headlong path of achievement and family founding and all of... and then he's... stopped. He knew he was in trouble, and he set out to find out what he suffered from. You are requested to close the eyes. Freud's dream the night of his father's funeral had warned him to close his eyes. But to understand his troubled patients and himself, he would have to open them. In the months following his father's death, Freud's confusion deepened. Six days a week he analyzed his patients, many of them suffering from hysteria. Increasingly, their problems resonated with his own. Freud began to suspect that he, too, was neurotic, suffering from what he described as "a little case of hysteria." In the spring of 1897, he wrote his friend Fliess about a new patient, a young woman with hysterical symptoms. It turned out that her supposedly otherwise noble and respectable father regularly took her to bed when she was eight to 12 years old and misused her. It was, Freud wrote, fresh confirmation that the prime cause of hysteria was the sexual abuse of an innocent child by an adult, most often a father. But his theory had alarming implications. If he himself suffered from a form of hysteria, and if hysteria was caused by an abusive father, then Freud was forced to draw a distressing conclusion: He began to imagine that his own father might have abused him. Three months after Jacob's death, he wrote Fliess. Unfortunately, my own father was one of these perverts and is responsible for the hysteria of my brother and those of several younger sisters. Freud thinks, "Oh, my God, "if hysteria is due to a seduction by father, then my father's a pervert or a seducer." It's like spitting on his father's grave. If his theory worked, his father would suddenly become some sort of a, you know, sexual monster. As his anguish grew more and more intense, Freud turned to the therapy he had invented to help others to ease his own suffering. He subjected his tumultuous thoughts and feelings to examination by the only doctor alive who could analyze them... Dr. Freud. My recovery can only come about through work in the unconscious; I cannot manage with conscious efforts alone. During the very period where he's so creative, he also was very conflicted. He's studying the human mind, and it's hard to imagine that it doesn't stir up some of his own concerns. That's one motive for the period of self-analysis that he engages in: He's trying to cure himself. You have to be able to be the patient to be the analyst, and Freud, in his own way, was making that discovery. He was in those years the patient. He realized that he cannot get further in understanding others, unless he analyzes himself. That was another one of those great ideas. Things are bubbling in me. I have felt impelled to start working on dreams, where I feel most certain. Freud was inventing a new theory of mental life bit by bit, layer upon layer. As he analyzed himself in solitude, searching for ways to explore the hidden recesses of his mind, he turned to dreams to help him. "Dreams," he would one day say, "are the royal road to the unconscious." Freud began recording dreams, without exactly knowing why, by 1892. He happens to be a good dreamer. He dreams a lot and he remembers a lot and he writes them down. And as he reads them and reads them, he begins to, well, interpret them. Freud believed that he had discovered the secret force common to every dream. Dreams, he said, were wishes longing to be gratified. There is a dream of wandering about among strangers undressed, undressed and with feelings of shame and anxiety. Oddly enough, the bystanders don't seem to notice, for which we have to thank wish fulfillment. Freud had a theory that dreams are wishes which have been repressed. The mind is very intent on not letting itself know certain disgusting, mean, unpleasant, self-centered things... whatever... Which are in all of our minds, and which we hold back. The dream is a way of revealing some of this if you know how to do it. Freud states that the motive force for every dream, even when it appears to be not the case, is always an unacceptable infantile wish. In sleep, all those forbidden wishes, ideas, fantasies, desires, are much more likely to emerge into consciousness... Not waking consciousness but sleeping consciousness. But even there, they don't emerge freely, and even there they're disguised, and that's why the dreams have to be interpreted. Suppressed and forbidden wishes from childhood breakthrough in the dream. It is only in our childhood that we feel no shame at our nakedness. Undressing has almost intoxicating effect on many children... They laugh and jump about. When we look back at this unashamed period of childhood, it seems to us a paradise; mankind was naked in paradise and was without shame. But we can regain this paradise every night in our dreams. Thus, dreams of being naked are dreams of exhibiting. The dreams that he analyzed are not really particularly well analyzed. They were just the beginning. At that time, it's so simple. "All dreams are wish fulfillment" is a simplification, but you need the courage to start, and a simplification enables you to start. If the dreams are complex, and some of them contain wishes and some of them contain anxieties or fears, then the whole task is difficult so you don't start it. You needed the oversimplification in order to start the process. As Freud analyzed himself, he was often perplexed. With his imagination on fire, he had a dream that seemed to confirm his theory that abusive fathers caused hysteria. I saw "Hella" before me, printed in heavy type. He had dreamed, he wrote Fliess, of having "overly affectionate feelings" for a young girl named Hella. Freud believed that dreams could be interpreted by free associating... letting the mind wander randomly, settling on events from the present or dredging up long-forgotten images from the past. You really can't interpret a dream unless you have the dreamer's personal associations to the dream. You can't just take a handbook and read the dream and say, "Ah, this means that, and that means that," because the same content, given different associations by different patients, could have different meanings. As his mind wandered, Freud connected "Hella," the word for ancient Greece, to his oldest daughter, Mathilda. Mathilda may have been called Hella because she is enthralled by the mythology of ancient Hellas and regards all Hellenes as heroes. Freud turned to his theory that dreams were secret wishes and came up with an interpretation. His "overly affectionate feelings" for Mathilda were so intense that he was capable of abusing his own child, just as he assumed the fathers of some of his patients had abused their children. The dream shows a fulfillment of my wish to pin down the father as the originator of neurosis and put an end to my persistent doubts. This is really not a very good interpretation and only shows that he was desperately hanging on to this theory, which was really quite implausible. This is a good example of an unanalyzed dream. He doesn't say what he means by "over affectionate." Does he mean "sexual"? See, an analyst would have said to him, "Nu? So? So, what do you make of it?" That June, Freud took his family to the mountains outside Vienna. They picked flowers and hunted mushrooms, as was their custom, but he remained haunted by the problem of hysteria. He was having, he wrote, "grave doubts" about his theory, leaving him in a state of "fathomless and bottomless laziness, intellectual stagnation." I have never before even imagined anything like this period of intellectual paralysis. I have been through some kind of neurotic experience, curious states, twilight thoughts, veiled doubts. The chief patient I am preoccupied with is myself, my little hysteria. The analysis is more difficult than any other. Something from the deepest depths of my own neurosis sets itself against any advance in understanding neurosis. I am dull with it. I believe I am in a cocoon, and God knows what sort of beast will crawl out. Then, on September 21, 1897, Freud wrote Fliess an astonishing letter. The theory he had been evolving over the last five years he now believed was wrong. I will confide in you at once the great secret that has been slowly dawning on me in the last few months: I no longer believe in my theory of the neurosis. He had a very simple theory... that every hysteric had suffered from some kind of early sexual trauma. But as he worked further with this, he began to question whether there were other causes to hysteria, particularly as he discovered he wasn't able to cure his hysterics. It wasn't working out according to theory. Freud concluded that most of his neurotic patients had not been abused, and that his suspicions about his father were wrong, that Jacob never abused him, his brother or sisters. Now I have no idea where I stand. His theory shattered, Freud drifted. The expectation of eternal fame was so beautiful... certain wealth, travels, and lifting the children above the severe worries that robbed me of my youth. Everything depended upon whether or not hysteria would come out right. Then, after agonizing days of self-analysis, Freud reached a conclusion that would transform the very nature of the theory of mental life he was still inventing. His patients, Freud now believed, had been reporting fantasies. In most cases there had been no abuse, only conflicted wishes and desires. When I pulled myself together, I was able to draw the right conclusions, namely that neurotic symptoms are not related directly to actual events but to fantasies embodying wishes. Freud takes the emphasis off the experiences that a person has in the world and puts them on the intrapsychic life, what happens in a person's inner world. We've moved from the notion of an external trauma to an inner wish and desire that's unacceptable to the person... that's now the trauma. That's a major shift. This liberated Freud, as is were, to appreciate the power of fantasy, the extraordinary complexity of the meaning of dreams, the richness of intrapsychic life. By switching from actual seduction to seduction fantasies, Freud has now entered the world of the mind and the world of imagination. It becomes extraordinary material for the humanities, literature, the arts. We're now into the area of self-deception, truth, confronting oneself, conflict, and that's the birth of psychoanalysis. My self-analysis is the most essential thing I have. I am gripped and pulled through old times in quick association of thoughts. As the great poet puts it, "And the shades of loved ones appear." As Freud struggled to learn the most secret things about himself, his childhood was coming back in a rush of discovery... disconnected memories, and dreams. He recalled a nightmare about his mother from which he had awakened in tears, screaming. It was very vivid and showed me my beloved mother with a peculiarly calm sleeping facial expression, being carried into the room by people with bird beaks. Freud carried the dream all his life. Not only was it a nightmare at the time, but Freud could never forget it. For Freud, dreams were riddles sometimes hiding their secrets by playing with words. Freud concentrated on the birds... In German, the word is Vogel. The plural is Voegel, which is an obscene German word for sex, having sex. I awoke in anxiety, which did not end until I woke my parents up. The anxiety can be traced back to an obscure and sexual craving. Freud found the explanation of his sexual craving in a wish: He lusted for his mother, in violation of a taboo against incest common to every religion and culture. I have found in my own case the phenomena of being in love with my mother and jealous of my father, and I now consider it a universal event in early childhood. If this is so, we can understand the gripping power of the Greek legend Oedipus Rex. Freud was putting together the rudiments of what would one day be called the Oedipus complex. The Oedipus complex would become another cornerstone of his thinking, critical, he believed, to the formation of character and personality in everyone. Freud is saying that all children have these incestuous and rivalrous feelings. It is an inevitable and universal aspect of a boy's development across all people within a culture and across all cultures. I mean, that's a... quite an extraordinary claim. This is a good example of something that is characteristic of Freud... Namely, universalizing his own personal experiences... Which would make a careful scientist go crazy, but it also paradoxically reflects Freud's desire to develop a universal theory of human nature. That is, there is a scientific impulse behind it. He's not interested in accounting for an individual case; he's interested in a theory of the mind and the nature of human nature. So this universalizing is paradoxically both scientifically reckless and scientifically inspired. Freud discovers the Oedipal in himself. He expresses the Oedipal conflict on the personal level. It seems clear that this comes out of his own experience of being adored and worshiped by his mother. I have found that people who know that they are preferred or favored by their mothers give evidence in their lives of a peculiar self-reliance and an unshakable optimism, which often bring actual success to their possessors. All his adult life, Freud went to see his mother, Amalie, every Sunday, always bringing flowers, delighting in her praise, making much of her devotion. He always emphasized that she was a very beautiful woman, very vivacious and... and attractive. He was close to her, she was certainly close to him. She was very strong. We know from comments by other relatives that she was domineering and dictatorial. I think he was a little afraid of her. I only remember that she didn't like to be called Urgrossmutter, which means "great-grandmother," because she was... she didn't want to appear so old. If a man has been his mother's undisputed darling, he retains throughout life triumphant feelings. This is altogether the most perfect, the most free from ambivalence of all human relationships. Anxious to preserve the gratifying thought of the purity of his mother's love, Freud never looked too deeply into their relationship. We all prefer legend to fact, and he was no exception. Freud said that he was her golden-haired Sigi. It was a wishful fantasy. He saw his mother weekly for Sunday lunch, but he had stomachaches every time. We also know that he didn't go to his mother's funeral. Now, he was an old man by that time. But so all of that makes me suspect that the relationship was not as wonderful as Freud described. And if you create an image of your mother which doesn't correspond to reality, if you idealize her, then you don't want to know who she is. And if you don't want to know who she is, then the likelihood is that you will not look very carefully at any other woman. Freud would later say that women were largely "a dark continent." "What does woman want?" he asked. He never found a satisfactory answer. Freud's views of women are totally mired in a culture in which there were enormous prejudices about the capacities of women. He saw women as ultimately restricted by their biology. It led him to focus on inherent limitations in women. He saw their role in childbearing, which demanded so much time and attention. He saw women's sexual development as an aborted development based on discovering that they didn't have penises, and therefore they were thrown off course for the rest of life. His understanding of women was notoriously inadequate, but he did make great steps beyond what was understood about women when he came on the scene. It was very unusual in Freud's time even to acknowledge that women had sexual desire, much less to say that the repression of their sexual desire could make them hysterical. While Freud idealized his relationship with his mother, a disturbing memory revealed his tangled feelings toward his father. When Freud was ten, Jacob had told him a story. "When I was a young man," my father said, "I went for a walk one Saturday. I was well dressed and had a new fur cap on my head." "A Christian came up to me and with a single blow knocked off my cap into the mud and shouted, 'Jew!'" "And what did you do?" I asked. "I picked up my cap" was his quiet reply. This was a major disappointment for Freud. He was hoping that his father would have done something dramatic and grand. He wanted a father who was defiant, not someone who was submissive. It was a perfectly good adjustment on Freud's father's part, but it was not calculated to make the son feel that his father is a heroic figure. He lost his respect for his father. He grows beyond the father. He's a little boy who was, in his own understanding, the apple of his mother's eye, and his father was his rival. And he won. That can be as difficult as losing. To triumph over your father can induce a great feeling of guilt, particularly when they die, if you, for example, wanted them to. All his life, Freud had masked his disappointment in his father, especially from himself. He never questioned Jacob's authority or blamed him for the unexpected calamity that cast a shadow over his childhood. Freud traced to his first years his sense of confidence and destiny. His earliest memories were of a simple provincial town 150 miles north of Vienna, where he was born in a rented room over a blacksmith shop. I was born on May 6, 1856, at Freiberg in Moravia, a small town in what is now Czechoslovakia. I recall an anecdote I often heard repeated in my childhood. At the time of my birth, an old peasant woman had prophesied to my proud mother that with her firstborn child she brought a great man into the world. Jacob was 40 when Freud was born... 20 years older than Freud's mother, Amalie. The patriarch of a large extended family, he had already been married twice, with children from his first marriage older than Amalie. One of those sons from the first marriage was, Freud felt, flirtatious with Freud's own mother. So there was a lot of intergenerational complexity there. There's a boy who grew up with his relationship curiosity at high pitch. Most of Freiberg's 5,000 citizens were Roman Catholic. The town itself was dominated by the steeple of St. Mary's Church, boasting the best chimes in the district. I once asked my mother whether she remembered my nurse. "Of course," she said. "She was always taking you to church. "When you came home you used to preach and tell us all about how God conducted his affairs." Playing happily in the fields beyond his village, surrounded by an adoring family, Freud fondly recollected his early years. Of one thing I am certain: Deep within me, covered over, there still lives that happy child from Freiberg, the firstborn son of a youthful mother, who had received the first indelible impressions from this air, from this soil. But when Freud was three, everything changed. In 1859, Freud left Freiberg forever. Jacob's business had failed. Fractured memories were all that remained of that traumatic leave-taking: the gas lamps at the train station, which reminded him of souls burning in hell... And a furtive glimpse of his mother, nude. He was leaving behind everything he knew and loved. His aunts, uncles, nephews, playmates... all gone. For the rest of his life, Freud was haunted by the sense of something irretrievably lost. I have never got over the longing for my home. Bankrupt, Freud's father took his family to Vienna, where they lived in what had once been the Jewish ghetto, moving from one miserable apartment to the next, six times in 15 years. Jacob never found a full-time job again. Until the day he died he would depend upon handouts from relatives. Freud's father was a very dubious person. Nobody knows exactly how he made a living. He was a kind of a dreamer. He had no particular talents or particular connections or anything to allow him to be anything more than a ne'er-do-well. My grandfather grew up in extreme poverty. The family was all the time worried about money. That pervaded the atmosphere. When wild horses on the pampas have once been lassoed, they retain a certain nervousness for life. In the same way, I once knew helpless poverty and have a constant fear of it. Freud became the focus of his parents' most extravagant hopes. A brilliant student, he finished at the top of his gymnasium class six out of eight years. Five sisters and a brother were born by the time he was ten, but in the growing family constellation, the firstborn son remained the brightest star. When he complained that his sister's piano playing interfered with his concentration, his mother stopped the piano lessons. As Freud grew to manhood, he rarely indulged in the pleasures of Viennese society. Studying as if he were on some kind of mission, he seldom frequented the caf√©s and never dallied with girls. Vienna was changing all around him. By the time Freud was 41, married and a father of six, the Austrian capital was filled with an intoxicating air of cultural ferment. Like Freud himself, Viennese artists at the dawn of the 20th century were turning inward... penetrating beneath the surface of consciousness to reveal buried layers of tumultuous feelings. Their efforts to comprehend the irrational mirrored Freud's own. But Freud never showed any interest. He was not really at home with the artists of his generation. I think he felt that they were a little strange. There was in him the bourgeois. Freud was a man of old-fashioned tastes. His home was crowded with embroidered tablecloths, Oriental rugs, plush chairs and family photographs. He disliked telephones and bicycles and never used a typewriter. He thrived in an atmosphere of solidity and order, as if he needed a firm foundation to explore the shifting, timeless world of the unconscious. He was very conventional in his lifestyle. It was a very organized home. The meals were exactly on the hour. He had his mealtime and the household was built around his schedule. There was nothing casual in that family. Nothing was ever casual. It was all quite formal. It was a formal society. Every Sunday, the family assembled in the Freud household, including myself. He would come out at 12:00, and his physical contact was... you did like this. You put your two fingers and you squeezed the child's cheeks, which was a sign of affection. You did not hug or anything like that. You did this. After 11 years, Freud's marriage had become largely a matter of habit. Freud and Martha were drifting apart, their sexual life, Freud admitted to a friend, sadly waning. They shared a devotion to the children, but Martha, burdened by domestic duties, had little interest in her husband's work. "As far as psychoanalysis was concerned," his daughter wrote, "my mother never cooperated. "My mother believed in my father, not psychoanalysis. She thought psychoanalysis was rather a dirty occupation, dealing with all kinds of awful things. He wrote these strange books. I don't even think she ever read them. She was a very bright woman, a very engaged one, but not interested in progressive child rearing, not interested in the liberation of women, uh, really very conservative. Out of this orderly, bourgeois life would come a break with the past that would create an intellectual revolution. Freud would pour everything he had learned into a book that would signal a shift in the way men and women imagined their inner lives. He would call his book The Interpretation of Dreams. November 5, 1897. My self-analysis is once more at a standstill, or rather, it slowly trickles on without my understanding anything of the course it takes. November 10. I shall force myself to write the dream book... To come out of it. February 9, 1898. I am deep in the dream book. I'm writing it fluently and enjoy the thoughts of the head shaking that will come of the book's indiscretions. Several chapters of the dream book already are complete. It is turning out nicely... The Philistines will rejoice at being able to say that with this I have put myself beyond the pale... I have finished a whole section of the dream book... Comments of Oedipus Rex and possibly Hamlet will find their place... I'm curious about what else will occur to me... I must read up on the Oedipus legend... Do not know where yet... How can I make this credible to anyone? The book consumed him. He suffered from excruciating migraines and back pains, fretted about money, feared his psychoanalytic practice was failing, even considered changing his profession and moving to a new city. He was being devoured, he wrote, "like a cancer." How can I ever hope to gain an insight into the whole of mental activity? As Freud explored the unknown, he grew more and more dependent on his friend, Wilhelm Fliess, the only person whom he dared entrust with the manuscript. You shall not refuse me the duties of the first audience and the supreme judge. I shall change whatever you want and gratefully accept contributions. I cannot write entirely without an audience, but do not at all mind writing only for you. Even on vacation, Freud brought his manuscript with him and drew inspiration from hiking the high alpine trails. The whole book is planned on the model of an imaginary walk. At the beginning, the dark forest of authors, hopelessly lost on wrong tracks. Then a concealed pass through which I'll lead the reader. And then suddenly, the high ground. He had a classical conception that his book would be like Dante's journey into the inferno and then back out. Slowly, The Interpretation of Dreams grew in size until it reached 250,000 words, the longest book he would ever write. August 1, 1899. I am working on the completion of the dream book in a large, quiet ground-floor room with a view of the mountains. There are some mushrooms here as well. The children naturally join in the hunt for them. All this work has been very good for my emotional life. I am apparently much more normal than I was four or five years ago. At the end of August 1899, after three years, Freud finished his book in a farmhouse in Berchtesgaden high in the German Alps, looking out on what would one day be the site of the vacation home of Adolf Hitler. The book's first words rang out with a triumphant note of confidence. In the pages that follow, I shall bring forward proof that there is a psychological technique which makes it possible to interpret dreams, and that, if that procedure is employed, every dream reveals itself as a psychical structure which has a meaning and which can be inserted at an assignable point in the mental activities of waking life. It's his first general philosophical, psychological statement about how the mind works. And even though he... he revised that statement many times after that, it still was the touchstone statement for the whole psychoanalytical inquiry into mental processes. The book is not just a theory about dreams. He uses dreams and dreaming to develop and weave an entire theory of mental functioning: perception, memory, wishes. That, I believe, is the reason and the foundation for why it's viewed as a landmark. In the dream book the Oedipus complex is stated there. The role of infantile sexuality is recognized. That dreams have meaning is recognized. The patient is asked to free-associate. Once you have the dream book, you can start business as a psychoanalyst because you know at least you have a hunch of how to do it. The Interpretation of Dreams contains the most valuable of all the discoveries it has been my good fortune to make. Insight such as this falls to one's lot but once in a lifetime. It was only later that Freud revealed the impetus behind the most important book he ever wrote. It was a portion of my own self-analysis: my reaction to my father's death. That is to say, to the most important event, the most poignant loss of a man's life. The Interpretation of Dreams was published in November 1899, with the title page dated 1900. During the next six years, the book would sell only 351 copies. It would take two decades before Freud achieved the fame he had always imagined. In the years that followed, while he elaborated and refined his theories, Freud created a movement, beginning with a small cadre of men who helped spread his ideas around the world. He put the unconscious on the map. He put it on the cultural folksy map. Everyone loved it, because things that were puzzling to people before that suddenly made sense, and we all want to make sense out of our crazy behavior. As his fame grew, his name became a household word, his theories the chat of cocktail parties and the popular press. Confusion and even apprehension surrounded the bearded Dr. Freud, who supposedly found in sex the meaning of life. "I'm not famous," Freud said, "I'm notorious." He has things to say which are extremely subversive. He was a bourgeois who made bombs in his living room. From analyzing his patients, Freud took to analyzing the world itself, elaborating a troubling view of the human condition. He once said, "I bring them the plague." Now, that may be an exaggeration, but he certainly did not make life easier for people. He says, "When you think of me, think of Rembrandt... A little light and a great deal of darkness." In 1933, the Nazis came to power and burned his books alongside those of Thomas Mann, Bertolt Brecht and Albert Einstein. "What progress we're making," Freud told a friend. "In the Middle Ages they would have burned me. Nowadays they're content with burning my books." Five years later, Freud fled to England. Even in his last years, he never offered easy consolation. For Freud, there was no salvation, not even psychoanalysis. He offered instead a way to probe the darkness with the light of reason and two principles to live by: work and love. What Freud insists on is cure through truth. In a world of quick fixes, drugs and neuroscience, Freud teaches us about the role of meaning and conflict and desire and wish in shaping our lives, our happiness and our suffering. "Know thyself" is not simply... no longer only a Socratic imperative, but it's a clinical necessity. "The truth shall set ye free." By the time of his death from mouth cancer in 1939, Freud's ideas had become part of the fabric of 20th-century life. But all of them lay implicit in the discoveries he made before 1900. It was then, during long years of false starts and erratic detours, he had looked into the darkness of his own heart, and in turmoil and confusion rallied himself the only way he knew how: He trusted to his own unconscious. Something is at work on the lowest floor, wild things. Again, come, you hovering forms. This program was made possible in part by a grant from: and by contributions to your PBS station from:
