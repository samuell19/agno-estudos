Katia... Do you have the fourth draft of the file? May I borrow it? Jean-Fran?ois, is your page 9 the same? Page 9... Yeah. Right... - You're sure? - Yes, I can't resist. - See you Tuesday then. - Yes. - Don't break anything. - Ok. Jean-Fran?ois, it's Pierre. No, I feel pretty sick. Some sort of flu or a virus. No, I was just at the doctor's. He gave me analgesics for the fever and said I needed to rest. I have to stay at home so... I'm not sure when I'll be back. Thursday or Friday, I guess. No, not before. I know it's a drag. Yes, I'm home. Tell the team I'm sorry. No, that's kind. I'll order stuff. Don't bother. No, that's kind. Ok, bye. I'll keep you posted. Bye. See you. Walking on a glacier There've been heatwaves before, but they're nearly every year now. It's very hot today. Where you see the ice cave now, there'll be nothing in two years. Hello. Remember there's less oxygen. Drink a lot. Use your left hand to hold the rope. Warning: High mountain range! - Ready? - Let's go. Have a good day. - Have a good day. - You too. You can see the route, above the belay stance. The steep part before the shelf. You can see it clearly. Just above it... After the big block? Yes, the horn sticking out. Above it is the normal route, that S to the peak. Or, from the horn, you can abseil down. What did you do? We abseiled down. It took us longer than planned. The gully was dry, without enough ice. I have photos. Take a look. This was the first pitch, with a fair bit of snow. As we climbed higher, it got drier on the couloir. - It's really narrow. - Narrow and steep. Fantastic. - That's a gully, right? - Exactly. It's a change from the climbing gym. That's for sure. Hi. Good morning. - Pierre? - Yes. Hello. - Hi. How's it going? - Great. And you? This is unusual. I rarely meet clients here on the glacier. Like I told you yesterday, our goal is to head to the Pointe Lachenal. We cross the glacier. It won't take long. 30 to 45 minutes. Then we head up to that pass between the points on the right, before returning to the glacier on the right-hand side. There. - You're in your... - My harness is on. Your harnie, great. You have a bit of gear too. I have a crevasse kit. I saw that. It's best to turn the ice screw the other way. Like this, it pricks a bit, so turn it round. Or it'll tear your pants. I have all the technical gear. You just need your crampons, ice axe and helmet. Here's my house. Very roomy for one. These are the crampons I have. Brand-new, just one descent. I've worn them, so they're adjusted. Hold on a second... There, go on. One last safety thing... We're on the glacier... Up on the ridge, people were close to each other. On the glacier, we stay some way apart. We don't know where the crevasses are, so we stay 12 to 15 metres apart. Good for you? Once it's taut, follow me. If I go too fast, say so. - Ok? - I walk in your footsteps? Yes. It's a bit steeper. Use your ice axe for support. Rocks! Are you ok? Pierre? I'm ok. No harm done? No. That was a close call. Look where you put your feet. Use the area of the rock whitened by crampons crossing it. Bravo! The summit handshake. Bravo. Thank you. You did good. Over there, the Grandee Jorasses, with the Dent du G?ant to the right. - The Dent du G?ant is that tooth? - That's it. That canine on the rig fit. One of the 4,000 m peaks. Conditions were nice and mild today for the Dent du G?ant. And we can see your bivouac over there. Check to see the jackdaws aren't eating your food. - The second tent? - Yes. Just next to the bear opening the tent. Mum, I hope you're well. Sorry for not answering my phone much. and for not having been in touch. I can't explain why I stay here. I don't know myself. However, I can tell you I feel good. Better than I have felt lately, these last few years. I'll write to my brothers when I feel up to it. For now, give them all my best. Lots of love, your Pierrot. Excuse me, could you post this in Chamonix for me? I'll pay the postage. We're not from here. We don't really have time. - Sorry. - It's ok. Here. Thank you. Excuse me. Hello. Could I ask a favour of you? Yes. Well, it depends... To post this card in the valley and buy me a stamp. I have the money for it. All right. Are you a mountaineer? Yes... - You're not sure? - I am. Do you work here? Yes, right here. It's very good apparently. I've heard that too. Are you the chef? I have to get back. Pierre. Your card. Here. And the money. Thank you. Goodbye. Mum... Are you ok? Hi there. Are you doing ok? - Hi, Marc. - Hi. - Had a good journey? - Very good. - I slept... - We were eager to see you. It's pretty misty. It changes fast. Did something happen? Something in your life that upset you? Such as what? I don't know. It's up to you to tell us that. No, nothing special. - Do you need anything? - It's perfect, thanks. - Ladies? - It's lovely, thank you. Do you know her? Barely. Do you know that you... that you'll be fired? Yes. How do you know? They couldn't reach you. - So they called us. - I didn't know. Sorry. How will you manage? For what? To live! Marc... Really... I have some money put by. Ok, Pierre, come back with us later. We got you a ticket. That's kind. But no thanks. Listen, we all came down here to fetch you and... I think we were right. You're really losing it. It's blindingly obvious. You can make jokes, give forced smiles, say everything is cool, but we're not fooled. Tell him he's screwing up. Mum... Marc, please... It's true, we were surprised. I understand Marc worrying. That's normal. But, looking at you, you seem to be having a blast. Have you lost your minds? Why not encourage him too? Marc... Forgive me, Mum, for trying to prevent him from screwing up his life. Ok, enough of this crap. - You're coming with us. - No. You can't force me back down. Sit down. You're sick! You know your brother. When his mind's made up... I'll go talk to him. You feel good here? Yes. That's all I care about. - What's so funny? - Nothing, chef, it's ok. Go on, I want to laugh too. Sorry. Everything's fine. Hello. - Is this a bad time? - No, not at all. Do you want a coffee? Yes, please. Have a seat. Well? This will sound weird. It it's a favour, it's the second. Yes, I know. But I'll risk it. Do you think you could sell me rice, pasta, a few cans and so on? Sorry, that won't be possible. We only order what we need. Besides, I don't handle the money side. But I can help you out and keep some leftovers, but it won't be much. I'd like that, please. Otherwise, I can bring stuff up. If you want. That's very kind. But it'll take up your time. - I'll manage. - I don't mind. Here. Write your list. Are you sure? There. Here, I put my card PIN at the end. Just like that? Ok. All right then. I have to get back to work. Finish your coffee. Thank you. This is great, freeze-dried soups. I have your card. Thank you. And gas, great. Perfect. Does that happen often? Now and then. I can show you a great knot for laces. It won't come undone and it's easy to untie. - Shall I show you? - Ok. Do the same as me. Start as for a normal knot. Do the first bow. Then you double the second bow. Turn it around the first to the right, slip it under... I got it wrong. I'll do it slowly. So, do your first bow. Double the second one. Go around it once, but then pass the second bow under the first again. That's it. Perfect. Thanks. - It changes everything. - Yes. I'm sure of it. Are you from Paris? Yes. Is it obvious? Yes. - You're from here? - Yes. But I've moved about. Where? London, Lisbon, Vienna... I came back in the end. Have you ever been out on the glacier? Yes. Want to come for a hike on it? As thanks for the shopping. I'd like that. That's kind, but I'm not ready for a hike. I won't insist then. It's kind of you. - Thanks again. - You're welcome. - Have a good day. - Enjoy your hike. Shit... Another rockfall. And not a small one. Know where that was? Near the Brenva Glacier, I'd say. What just came down was huge. You shouldn't be around here. It could come down any minute. No, don't move! creatures fissures mountain lights snow mountain It looks good. You were in the rockfall? Not really, but I wasn't far. Do you know why rocks fall? Not really. A mountain isn't a block. It's like a mille-feuille, with layers of rock on top of each other, that hold together thanks to the ice, which acts like glue or cement. The problem is heat. When the ice melts, the rocks fall and the mountain crumbles. There. You know the mountains well. Yes. Yes? What is it? No, nothing. I'll take your temperature. 35.8?C. It's still a bit low. I'll get you some blankets. That'll help. - I'm not cold. - It's wiser. When will I be able to go? With your hypothermia, the intern will want to keep you tonight. Ok? I'll be right back. - How are you? - Fine, and you? I'm ok. L?a, I'll go on ahead. You went back down after all? Yes. I didn't have much choice. Why? I got a bit injured. Anything serious? No. Slight hypothermia and... two stitches. But I'm ok. You're back up already? Yes. Can we go? Just a minute, sweetie. - Your son? - Yes. Martin. Hello, Martin. I'm Pierre. How's it going? - What are you listening to? - Birds. To learn their songs. Do you want... Do you want lunch at the restaurant? I'm going quite a way, with a lot of gear. So I see. Where are you going? Towards the Brenva Glacier. Near the rockfall? Near there. But I'll be careful. - See you around then. - See you. - Say goodbye, Martin? - Bye. A bit more this side... Ok, go on. Go on, faster. Faster, faster... We'll come another time. - A race? - Go! Come on! Hi, Pierre, it's L?a. Just checking up on you. Call me anytime. Take care. Pierre! Pierre! Are you ok? Thank you. You're welcome. Hi. Want a coffee? Please. I'll go before everyone gets here. It's wiser, yes. See you soon? Yes. Yes, see you soon.
