I proclaim you Phillipides of Athens the champion of these Olympic Games may you thank the Gods For having giving you recient the victory 4 years hence, we shall gather at the eternal flame for the next Olympic games. To thee, divine Athena. To thee, I consecrate the laurels of Olympia. As thou has protected me, goddess, protect Athens, which bears thy name. Today is a day for celebration. Philippines has brought Athens the laws of the Olympic games. Now he returns to his post in the ranks of Athens sacred god. We must never forget that the people of Athens decreed only a short year ago. The exile of the Tyran Hippies and have forever vanished dictatorship. To you Philippines and to your companions of the sacred god. The Aphenians appoint you the custodians of their liberty Alright. I'm not afraid of death mentalities and hope we shall never have to fight for liberty but we live in a democracy and if there's war, then every citizen, every citizen will be a soldier. Bravo Philippides. You're a popular man today. I too make you the custodian of my liberty. The I'm just a peasant. The gods gave me strength but they gave you something even more precious. Intelligence. Be sure you make use of it. The sun sinks in splendor, red as blood, bringing the fearsome blackness of the night. While the desperate Trojans, pray to all the gods above, hoping to live till the dawn. Go on Andrometer, read us the passage about the great war. No, read us a story about Paris and Helen. Read Andrometer, whatever you like. Then I shall read you of Paris and Helen. Oh, wonderful. I always cry when I hear it. Is my father. I shall read it later. Bruce is your daughter doesn't seem to love her future husband. Every time she sees me, she frowns. No, no. You're wrong, The Operatives. He is wrong, isn't he Andrameda? You said it for me. you are in our meaning watch your father farmers to the me and I will to my marriage you on people enjoy this in my day we will parents and shows and trust are alleged and promire Felipe's will be a dangerous opponent for us. He's a friend of mine and he's bull headed like all our peasants. No. Felipe's is not to be a peasant. He is a man who love the soil only because he doesn't know anything better. We will show him how good life can be. And he'll be one of us. What do you mean? If we control the sacred guard, we can easily control the whole city of Athens. That is what Hippies and exiles suggest that we do. Philippes has to join us. Otherwise, it'll be done away with. The ocerative. You know I share your ideals and those of Hippious. I promised you my daughter. But I refuse to be involved in bloodshed. I refuse, huh, Cruises. I don't want Felipe's revolved. I want him with us to our ideals. Oh, you frightened me. Is hitting me part of the game? No. And losing a ball in a tree isn't part of the game either. I was trying to knock the ball out of the tree. It is not too easy to do. Wanna try? That wasn't so hard. How do you play this game? You throw the ball as far as possible like this. Is that alright? No, that was too far. You're as beautiful as a statue of a goddess. Why don't you like me? I know you. You are Felipe. Felipe's the hero of Olympia. And you? My name is. I won't tell you. We shall never meet again. We will meet again. Do you know the temple on the road to Perez? I know it very well. What are you talking about? He wants to see you again. He's just being kind. You're wrong. I really want to. Come on. Don't forget, she will dance with us in honor of Eve at the temple tonight. Remember, Are you Philippides? Yes, I am you are a fortunate man Philippides I have an invitation for you from my mistress a girl who will dance tonight? that's right Pillippides a girl will dance tonight. who do you know? what's her name? what difference does it make? she won't be more beautiful if you know the name - it doesn't matter - Alright, where should I go? follow me Yes, Philippides, the hero of Olympia and you, Karus will tame him. I hope he is at least a handsome man. Would I ask you to make love to him if he would not? Well, it would hardly be the first time you've lied to me, the occupied. Be careful of what you say. And think about what you have to do. Let me tell you this, win into my cause and you can name your price. Oh, that's much better. I adore to hear you when you talk that way. there he is Don't you want to see him? well what do you think of him? Good Night Karis I will leave it to your work You may go eat your expected. Welcome to my house. What's the matter? Are you not pleased by what you see, Philippe? I was expecting to see someone else. Huh? Prettier than me? -No, different. Who are you? Karis I was in Olympia the day you won you know I think I heard your name before I prepared a feast in your honor For me? You'll see The most wonderful dancers in Athens the finest wines wrestlers and music and it is all for you I thank you Karis, but no today we'll see about that You may drink with me. It's not a love potion. Do you really think so? I'm sure of it. When the moon is over the Acropolis, you shall see, you'll be here. Andromeda, Diana, come, it's time. Oh divine , in your goodness, grant that we find our beloved. Oh. They're not better than animals. Well, I thought they were the fight. Know what I'd pay them? I like this better don't you like wrestling at lot? I do by these men are not wrestlers they are killers those are what they are I thank you very much but I must leave. You are rude. You have to leave. I'm very sorry but I must. As you wish. Let me pass. Ok. Ah Do you expect me to believe that fantastic story? when do you meet him again? I never will I had already explained to you I'm not used to be rejected I don't like it and I don't want anybody to know it I don't give up so easy I thought you understood Karis what your position was. I decide what you do and when you do it, is that clear? This house is mine. Everything you have is mine. This time you are mistaken. And you too, Karis, are mine. You wish I would leave here. But don't ask me to do this. I've no desire to hurt Philippides. I pay well what is this with Pillippides? are you in love? he is the one in love but with another So that's it. Love someone else. And you love him. I will not see him any anymore. That was to remind you that you will see Philippines whether you want to or not. Don't obey me, You will obey all my orders whatever I tell you to do You have no choice. Otherwise, I will kill you. Come back to me. You say you hate weapons. Yet even a man like you might need them one day. You may be right but it would be better if weapons didn't exist. But they'd do exist Philippides. What if you were attacked by a swordsman? You would be at a disadvantage. You have to know how to use a sword. Here. Catch it. Alright. hurry. Again. Faster. I won't your shoulders. You're fast as the wind. Again. You try. now Beautiful. Perfect Another thing, a sword is not used only for hand-to-hand fighting. This way? No like this That was dead center. What is it? What happened to it? A girl. He saw her chariot and rode off after her. Why did you run from me? I have nothing to say to you. I only what it tell you I been thinking about you you only saw me once you don't even know my name Does it matter? I think that I I love you. Don't you believe me? It's no use. My future's been decided. You must never see me again. Listen, I won't give you up if you tell me one thing. Say that you could love me. No, you mustn't even hope it would be useless. Please forget me. Your name? Can't you tell me? Do I surprise you? I know you would never have come to see me. How did you get in? I don't have much trouble making men do what I want them to do. But not Philippities. I'm glad you came. I don't believe you. Not like that. You must never kiss me like that, Philippe. Kiss me when your anger has left you. There's no anger in me. Have no love. Don't worry, I know you don't love me. It's too much to ask for. I'm aware of that but I wanna make you happy. before I met you I had no need of love but now I do I love you I need you so much all you need is to get what you want you're cruel Philippides, it's time to release the guard I have to go goodbye Karis that's enough I invited him here so we could convince him. Convince Philippines. Might as well try to convince Muttie's. How do you suggest we go about it? You said you were the expert. Every man has his price. Somewhere rather. I hate his intrigues. Ipia is returning from exile. Soon we'll be able to act. The people are with us but the sacred god could ruin everything if it were against us, Crusus. Well then, you have an idea? Of course, and it's a beautiful one. What is it The I'll tell you later, don't worry. You sent for me, father? Yes. We're having an important guest, my dear. I want you to dine with us today. A very important guest, Andromeda. Very. A friend of yours? Not yet. But he soon may be one. What is his name? He'll tell you himself there he is. Philippines is here. Welcome to my home, Philippines. Your presence here is an honor. So is your invitation. this is my daughter who is to become my wife It seems you already know each other. We may have met but without really knowing each other. As this happens in a dream sometimes. If I had ever met you, even in a dream, I would remember. I don't understand a word of what you're talking about. The table is set. Be seated. Music. Music is excellent for the digestion if you please. find be the presents of wine. And round the sir also of line. Fine be the placeer of company. And not a beauty health life. What is it, Philippees? I'm afraid you're not having a very good time. On the contrary, I'm having a wonderful time. Councilman Session, at this hour, surprising? They must have an important reason. I'm very sorry but I must go. For Liberty is my house is yours and the will keep you company. Do you know what is going on? I know what everyone knows. Our fleet is decimated and the Persians threatened to land on our shores guided by the traitor Hippies. Not everyone thinks Hippies is a traitor. I'm very tired. Excuse me. Poor Andromeda. She's so sad and I think you know why, Philippines. What do you mean? You might as well admit that you know her. I suspected that you knew each other and when I saw her embarrassment on seeing you, I was certain of it. She never broke the promise she made. The promise her father gave to my father, you mean, our marriage was decided on while we were still children. She doesn't love me. If you wanna marry her, I might be able to help you. And what do you want in exchange? I, nothing. Cruises does. You and your sacred guard could be valuable to him. You see, they left the two of us alone. So, we might talk plainly. You can have Andrometer. Only if you aid us in our cause. Does Andromeda accept this? I said that she accept this and you. Do you accept? Tell the police I ask you a question. I am asking the questions. Answer me. Doesn't drummer agree to this. Oh, of course she does. Otherwise, we would hardly have asked you here. She would do it for a father. She would do anything for him and if necessary, she would do anything for our cause. Phillipides What do you want? I waited for you. I want to tell you how I really feel. I love you. So now you love me. Now I know that you're one of them. I'll have no part of the scheme. Goodbye. The liberty. Anybody. What did you tell him about me? Why does he hate me? He will be sorry. Since he came back from the city, he's not the same. He doesn't talk to anyone. Melchiades Hey, Philippines. Welcome, little tidys. I came for some of that fresh air you always talked about. The wind is from the east. Dries up the land. What are you talking about? The east wind brings rain. Belodies, bring us wine. What's new in Athens? Let me see. Oh, they finished the new bath. It's very expensive but to go there is a sign of distinction. It's not for us. Well, I've never been there myself but I hear The goes there all the time to show how rich he is to everyone. Do you know who misses you in Athens, Philippines? That very beautiful girl from my Cena. And you never said a word about her I don't know her She might had seen you at Olympia. she wan't the only girl who fall in love with you there they all went out of their minds when they saw you specially when you wrestled the Spartian I think he is a very good man Euros is his name he may had won but I had all the luck that day your friends in the secret guard don't call it luck Phillipides after you left Athens their heart went out of it they need your leadership They don't need me that much. No. We all need you now more than we ever did. but we understand why you wanted to leave Athens to avoid worry and responsabilities here you can have calm you can live pleasantly they are wrong there are responsabilities, here, everywhere But I'm not going back to Athens. I bring bad news. Person forces have begun to land at the Plane of Marathon. You must return to Athens. All goes well. What do you think of my army, hipus? You will see Darius, your Persians won't even have to fight. The Athenians and all of Greece wait for the great Darius to liberate them from the tyranny of their rulers. You will march into Athens in triumph. Yes, you may be right and yet you may be wrong. I put my faith in my soldiers. This is not the first time that our country has been invaded. This is not the first time that our country, our cities, and our people have been threatened with destruction. True. But never before has the danger been so great. The Persians have been a few hours marcher. What do you mean by that? That we should surrender that we should welcome the Persians as friends. Also see that Athens alone isn't strong enough to defeat Darius and his army. We're too few in number. At most, we might arm 10 thousand infantry men and 5,000 cavalry. It's six against one and we have no ships of war. We will arm everyone. Every and fight for an ideal common to every Athenian citizen. If we may not live in freedom, then we will die for freedom. Defend us from the Persians. We are waiting Melchiaves All of Athens waits to hear from you I'm sure you have an ingenious plan to lead us to victory I do not possess the divine power to transform a disaster into a triumph. The operas asks me for a miracle but he knows full well, it cannot be. I can only say this, my men will fight for Athens up to the end. We shall force the invader back into the sea or he will enslave our people. Everyone of us, every man who hates tyranny, his duty is to help fight the enemy. Well then, why have you held back all the men of the sacred god? These champions of the sacred god. Why do they stay in Athens? Only 100 men. Not enough to make a decisive difference in a war theocratist. They have been ordered to defend the temple of Palace Athena. I do not believe in miracles but I put faith in the will of the gods and in the justice of our force. What good is justice? What good is justice on the battlefield? There is no justice in war. Only great. The number of armed men is what caused. How can we match the Persian problem? You forget one thing, The Operatives. When a man fights on the side of justice, he has the strength of a giant. He who defends his home, his wife, and his children is a tiger before the enemy. A splendid massacre. That is what our commander proposes. We will all be slaughtered but in glory, look at what the odds are. We are one against six. The Light Pauls. It is true that if we alone here in Athens attempted to push back the Persians, there would be little hope for us. But if we had an ally with an army as strong as ours, then there would be hope for us. The army of Sparta, with the help of Sparta, Athens would be saved. And what guarantees the help of Sparta? The common peril. After Athens Sparta would be the Persian's target and after Sparta all of Greece, the Spartans know this. The Spartans have never trusted us. You're right. Sparta thinks that some Athenians are traitors ready to welcome the Persians but there is one man in whom they would believe a man they respect an Athenian who is above all suspicion the liberties as soon as our forces are ready Athens will march against the Persians and will face them on the plane of Marathon if the council approves my plan I order you Philippines to leave for Sparta immediately and enlist their help May the gods ride with you. We'll meet at Marathon. Farewell. I'm sure you will succeed. Thank you, Karis. I will do all I can. Goodbye. Andrometer. You love him, don't you? I should have realized before today that he was the man for you. Yes, I love him. But someone turned him away from me. Since the day he was our guest, he despises me. I hate me. I've been wrong at Ramadan. I've been so wrong in everything. The people are against Hippies. Is a liar. Father, you shouldn't blame yourself. no1 doubts your good faith. Maybe everything will be alright. why did you really come here anyway? you said you want me to do something for you well, what is it? tell me I want to make sure that Phillipedes won't be harm he loves you and I know you loves him Protect him Andrómeda. Phillipedes doesn't love me He loves you He's in love with me but he never spoke about you at all. Yet, I could see it in his eyes. I knew it when he kissed me that he loved another. I tried. But never could I make him forget you, Andromeda. Are you satisfied now? Are you? Charis, listen to me. Get out of here. You dare come here parading your precious innocence and your purity. Phillipedes loves you. What more do you want? Come on. Everyone has lost his head over this Phillipedes They expect to save Athens by sending him to Sparta. If he manages to get the spotter, I'll be surprised. Surprised? Why do you say that? Because we're at war and the road is treacherous. There are some men here to see you master. Tell me what happened. Where are the others? And Philippines. He's still alive. He got away. Oh, I hate you. Come on, you're coming with me. No, let me alone. The I'm taking you with me to the camp of Paris. No, I don't wanna go. I'm sorry, my dear. You know too much so you're coming with me. Athens is fighting for its life and yours eventually. The Athenian army is facing the Persian Horse at Marathon alone. The life of Athens depends on you. Athens asks you to help her fight. Sparta will listen to the appeal of Athens. But before the new moon has risen, there is nothing we can do. Our priests forbid us to fight until then. That is the will of the god. If the gods say that, then the gods will the destruction of all grace. Philippines is right. We must help Athens. When Darius has taken over Athens, then nothing will stand in his way. He will come and take over Sparta. You're forgetting your that for as long as we can remember, Sparta and Athens have been bitter enemies. Wars have divided us. How can we aid them after what we have suffered at their hands? Athean, we distrust you What proof do you have that this is not an Athean trick? The word of Phillipedes I Eurus, will budge for it Friends, I remember my encounter with Yuros at the Olympic Games. Yuros is a great fighter and he can tell you himself that strong arms do not win a fight. If the other parts of the body are not working with them. Spartans, our two cities are members of the same body and if they fight together, then it can make all the difference. Greece shall be saved. I have nothing more to say. Now, the fate of Greece is in your hand. Dalius wants to strike fear in the hearts of a man with a skull. Our men don't frighten easily motivities. Look, they're not using their cavalry. Let us attack them on the flanks. No, we better wait and see exactly what they're planning. Be patient. Opinions, listen to me. For liberty and our country's freedom. Forward. the carriage, let go the catapults No Mel. all by the tracks Atheneans, liberties, Atheneas Hold out Follow Me. Attack. Alright, The Ocratus. I'll give you the man of the thirty ships you want. The Athenians have no fleet in any case but beware, there better be no resistance when these men land in Pareas Once more, I want you to arrange for the complete surrender of the Athenian army. You know what happens to those who betray me. This idea of yours to attack Athens from the rear is your last chance. look over there. it's a woman Come here Karis She heard all you said. Stop Karis Let her die in the dirt. She's a spy. That is what will happen to all your enemies. Hail Darius. We'll meet again at Athens. it will soon be midnight. The Spartan should have been here by sunset. Eurus told me they would. Perhaps they've changed their minds. Perhaps they think that Darius will be satisfied just to conquer Athens. Today we were able to defend ourselves but tomorrow, without Sparta we have no chance at all. look over there it looks like the took a woman prisioner Phillipides, come here, quickly Found her just outside the camp. She asked for you. She said she had something to tell you. Karis - Philippides... Philippides... - What is it Karis? I want you to listen beloved Karis, what happened? Persian fleet will ligth the parade tomorrow they'll attack then lead by Teocrito Traitor Phillipedes beloved you must save Athens you mus hurry Phillipedes you must leave now for Athens or Karis would had died in vain what can we do against their fleet I want you and the men of the sacred guard to delay thier landing in Pareas alright, it's the only thing to do If Sparta men come on time we will be able to attack we will attach before dawn hold them as long as you can if you don't see us by noon... save yourself pray to the gods for her and pray for help prepare a funeral fire for this woman and bury her ashes on the field of battle. She fought and died as one of us. be quiet hide folks We'll be back in an hour. Father, what is it, Andromeda? I didn't hear you go to bed. I was worried. I couldn't get to sleep. I wanted to think a little. Do not worry about the Andrometer. Father, why won't you tell me? I'm not a child any longer yet you treat me like a baby. There is something wrong. Everything is wrong in drama. Everything. I'm sure that Philippities will succeed in his mission. A very touching family scene. Forgive me for interrupting you but this is important, Cruises. And between friends, there is no need to stand on ceremony. What do you want, The Operatives? The time has come to show hippies how loyal we are. I am here to hold you to your promises. What do you mean? Your father must convince the council to surrender to Darius. As the most vulnerable member of the council, he can make them do whatever he want. Whatever you want, you mean. Well, the I'm not a traitor to my country. I shall tell the council we must resist. I will not bow to tell you again. Convince the council or you will never see your daughter again. No. Stop. No. When you come to your senses. Not before. Listen to me. You have no choice anymore. If Athens does not surrender, it means the life of your daughter. Take care. Now, back to the feet. Phillipedes, What happened? hurry I want you to summon a sacred guard. We've got to get to Paris. The Persians are landing there. Attacking us from the rear. Listen carefully. Our orders are to hold back the Persians only as long as we can. Remember, we're only 100 against the whole fleet. We have no fear of them, Felipeties. We will hold them back as ordered. We have a chance if we surprise them. First, we'll set the stakes in the water and men, we fight only if I give the signal. Felipe's. Thank the gods you are still here for liberties. It's my master. My master Cruises. He's been wounded. He's dying. Won't you help him? Keep going. I'll be right back. I has nothing to be. Let's even come with her. She loves you for liberties. Where is Andromeda? The operatives took her away by force but I don't know where. I will do what I can to find her. I don't mind dying. I don't care what happens to me. But her and Noah, she's done nothing wrong. she is suffering Without knowing why. save her I can only say this, if the gods are just, they will alright, let's get started follow me you're in a hurry of course but you will get to Athens in my carriage don't be too sure coast of Pireus ahead hold your helm Perius, still ahead ready for my signal today you'll share my triumph as your slave or as my queen, you have your choice today I will have Athens at my feet impossible, the god will defeat you you're wrong even Zeus won't be able to stop this feast What happened over there? I can't understand it. I know this coast. The water is deep enough. hoist the sail stand by Stand by we will attack the center they will attach the flank they met the aquatis they are attacking let the fools try to attack us You are afraid tie her to the front Andromeda, you will regret that. We are being made for sir by a handful of men. forward. Don't let them get away. Open the doors. Attitude is too good. here they come They've got another boat. Let's board them. Good Work, this one is done for Now the the second one too everyone in the water follow me They are attacking under water kill them all. Andromeda Phillipedes they are coming in Phillipedes They are going to attack it's the end Andromeda Sparta didn't come in time Milzeade must had been defeated I'm not afraid I found you again Man the Oz. Head full of coast. throw away.. men
