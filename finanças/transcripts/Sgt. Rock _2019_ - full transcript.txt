[theme music playing] [distant guns firing] [gunshots and explosions] [grunts] [groans] [screams] [faint rumbling] Easy Company! Fall back! [whirring] [breathing heavily] [soldier] Go, go, go! Fall back! [nurse] Tell them he's awake. Where are my men? The medics found you half buried in a ditch and brought you here. Your entire unit is... - Gone. - What do you mean, gone? Dead? All of them? Officially, MIA. But, yes, all of them. I'm sorry. Sgt. Rock, if you'll come with me? I got to get back in the field. - My men are-- - Dead, Sergeant. You've been reassigned. The Lieutenant's waiting. At ease, Sergeant. Heard you got pretty banged up. Couple of bruises. I'm fit for duty. Good. I have a mission for you. We've obtained intelligence at a very high cost, that Nazi scientists are on the verge of completing what can only be described as a doomsday weapon. They're conducting experiments in some kind of medieval fortress deep inside enemy lines. We want those scientists. Alive. One more thing. For reasons that are about to become abundantly clear, the existence of your new unit is a closely guarded secret. These men are unlike any soldiers you've ever led. I've led all kinds. Uh-huh. Jesus. [unzips] [urinating] - [soldier] Don't take all night. - Yeah, yeah. [choking] [footsteps thudding] - [grunting] - [gasps] [roars] [gasping] [whimpering] [groans] Stand down, soldier. I thirst. Stand down! He may be a Nazi, but he's still a human being. Not food for the likes of you. [grunts] [door unlocking] [growls] [footsteps approaching] [woman gasps] We need them alive. [screams] Krieger! The door! [growls] - [gun cocks] - I think that's quite enough. Remarkable company you're keeping these days, Sergeant. Remarkable weapons. Desperate times. There is little shame in being an implement of war, Rock. You and I both know that. Now tell your people to release mine. Or what? [grunting] [groaning] [choking] [loud banging on door] For the Fuhrer! [machine powering up] [electricity crackling] [yelling] [banging continues] [roars] Stand down, men. This here is the cavalry. [laughing] No. [growling] [grunting] [growls] [bone cracks] [gun clicking] - [screaming] - [bone cracks] This was your weapon? [laughs] Left that part out of your mission briefing, did they? There's only five. Where's... [electricity crackling] [growling] [roaring] Dozer. Oh, dear. [growling] Dozer, it's me. - [growls] - [screams] [yelling] [breathing heavily] [speaks German] [gasps] No way out, Major. You won't shoot us. You need us alive. To build your own army of the dead. Isn't that Why you were sent here, Sergeant? That's right. Follow orders. Complete the mission. Implement their war. Velcoro, you still thirsty? Bottoms up. - No. Please! - [scientists whimpering] [Nazis screaming] [rumbling] Well, what are you waiting around for, an embossed invite? Fall in line, soldiers! I think Lieutenant Shrieve's been coddling you three. Well, I hope you enjoyed your vacation, 'cause it's the last you're gonna get. Now move out! [theme music playing]
