Aah... Madam, we tested the cocaine recovered from the truck. It's pure cocaine without cut. More than 900 kilos. Its market value must be more than a billion, madam. No one's ever nabbed such a large consignment in the entire state. You are the first. Madam. Even the department's never seen this before. SARASWATI ORPHANAGE Jyoti. Jyoti. Jyoti. -Have you seen Jyoti? -No. Jyoti. One for you and one for me. You always share a piece of your bread with him. Even two isn't enough for us. He is an orphan like us. He has no one except for us. Jyoti, don't stay out too long playing. And turn it in early tonight. But why? Someone's going to pay you a visit tomorrow. Meet me? Who is coming to see me? See yourself tomorrow. Who is coming to see me? Come. It's been 10 years. It's time for your release. Brother. Who is he? If I tell you his name, you'll fall at his feet. The lesser you know about him, the better. No one knows who he is or where he comes from. And one who did know isn't alive to tell. They say whenever he appears, there's been war. They say his identity is like the ocean. Calm on the outside, a raging storm on the inside. When he smears ash on himself, his enemies turn to ashes. ♪ Bholaa ♪ ♪ Bholaa ♪ ♪ Bholaa ♪ ♪ Bholaa ♪ Read the Gita before leaving. Don't go outside and start a Mahabharat.

Either he will find us tonight, or we will find him. -Everybody needs to be on high alert. -Okay, ma'am. -Be alert. -Madam. You should stay. You have been shot.

I think uncle's been wronged. Maybe he's here to make a complaint. Jai Hind, sir. My name is Angad Yadav. Here is my joining letter. You have come to the right place. Because this place is the centre for all crimes. Mining, robbery, narcotics. Every department keeps screwing us. There's less work and more slavery. Been working for the department for over 40 years. Who cares now? Want anything? Don't look over there. The speaker and alcohol belong to the boys. Where are you from? Chainpur, near Unnao. Pipri village. Naina. Madam. This is a police station, not the market. How can you slap him? Is she your sister? She isn't, but you can make her. I have a Rakhi. You keep the rakhi. I ordered a nuptial necklace for her. Hey... keep your voice down. Sit quietly, or else I will put you behind bars. Yes, sir. Sir, please let them go. Let these... idiots go. Sir, they are students. Student? They were celebrating in the middle of the road. Dancing and all. And trying to be a wise guy? Got arrested with the lot. Keep seated. -Yadavji. -Yes. Find yourself a seat and sit down. Because madam won't be here soon. Yes. Naina. I am sorry. I love you. Me too. It's because sir didn't approve... Just a second. Jai Hind sir. Mr. Deep Singh. What if you become a millionaire without the hassle-- Coffee. What will you do with an amount like that? Sir... sir... please... Just give the orders. It also needs to be carried out precisely. Opportunities often screw you up. -Yes. -Has everyone arrived? Yes, sir. Most of them are here, and more are still on the way. -Then let us begin too. -Of course, sir. Tell me. -Jai Hind, madam. -Jai Hind. What happened to your arm? Just a minor accident. Who is he? Saw him on the way here. Had a gash on his face? I asked him for an ID, and he gave me a cold stare. He was giving me attitude when I questioned him. Me. Attitude problem, madam. So I detained him. I'll let him go after a routine inquiry. I had the entire consignment stashed away. And also locked those seven up. Do you think Lalganj station is safe? Yes, sir. In fact, it's the safest place I know. It was a British period jail. It's a robust structure made of stone. The British also built a bunker below. For their safety. So... penetrating that building is next to impossible, sir. Did you find out which gang the consignment belongs to? Sikka Gang. Sikka Gang. Ashwathama and his brother Nithari, who no one has seen. They have been giving the department a tough time. They work pretty mysteriously, sir. So they have never been arrested yet. From Purvanchal to northern UP, every gang, be it big or small, works for them. And, sir, this is not possible without political support. Also not be possible without our department's support. Did you share this information with anyone? -Not at all, sir. -Good. Until the court doesn't take custody of the consignment, don't tell anyone. For now, let's pretend everything is normal. Come. Join us for a drink. Sir, I am on antibiotics. I can't. Boys. I am glad this is my last day. I mean... the last day of my job. -Cheers. -Cheers! Another thing. This liquor was bought with honest money. Sip it slowly. It can get you pretty high. I think he's had too much already. In my career, I've put several criminals-- Rohypnol. High sedative. It's banned around the world. Starts showing effect in 15 minutes. The person will come around only after eight hours. Another thing. Be careful. If you overdose them, the person won't just lie down. But fall asleep... permanently. Sir. Sir, this is a trap. I'll inform the PAC immediately. No. Don't trust anyone. One mistake by the police, raises a question on the entire administration. Today is my last day, Diana. Don't let me get tainted. All five officers are in one place. Go get them. Still no clue about brother Nithari. There's been a pretty big screwup. Yeah, Diana. Judging by your description, it could be Rohypnol, Midazolam, Ketamine or Diazepam, or any of the above. The treatment must start within five hours. Otherwise, their life could be in jeopardy. I am bringing them to the hospital immediately. Your location has been compromised. As well as of the consignment. Leave right now. Listen, no one's going to eat or drink anything. Dump everything. Whose truck is that? Ours, ma'am. We are the caterers. Where is the driver? The driver is drunk and passed out. Ohh... Can one of you drive a truck? They can't steer a bullock cart, lest drive a truck. And you? Me... I am still an amateur, madam. I tried my hand at the steering once. Ended up hitting my girlfriend. She ran for her life and never returned. Listen, can you drive a truck? I am asking you. Can you drive a truck? Laalganj is another 80 kilometres from here. You can leave once you take us there. There won't be any charges against you. Okay? Let's go. No. What do you mean no? You said you can drive a truck. I said I can. I never said I will. Rascal. The minute your cuffs come off, you show your true colours. Do cops press charges judging by the face now, No, by your attitude. And if you try to give me attitude-- To a cop, even an earnest man has attitude problem. Speak here. Yes. This is SP Diana. And you are? I am probation officer Kiron Dhillon. Naini Jail. Is he an inmate? Was? Not anymore. He was sentenced to life, but was let off early for good behaviour. He was released today, and also has a release order. You can take a look if you want. Look, Kiron-ji, this is an emergency. We must get to Laalganj in a truck. There is no one around, and he is refusing to help. Why would he? And I cannot give him permission for this. Look, try to understand. You try to understand, madam. That man's been in jail for 10 years, and he's never seen his daughter. Years later we learnt, she is at an orphanage in Lucknow. And he's going to meet her. Please don't drag that poor guy into this. I request you. Let him go. If he doesn't drive this truck, then 40 policemen could die. Will you take responsibility? Fine, give him the phone. Talk to her. Hello. Help them if you can. I finally managed to get my life back, which I had lost. Don't drag me into this. I'll call you after I board the bus. I'll tear your release orders to pieces, and throw you back in jail. Then you can meet your daughter. Be it a man or woman in uniform, they all like to flex their power. I was on my way to meet my daughter. But he broke my shirt's button. These cops are who keep the country safe. Or you know what would happen to the country. They were showing patriotism by getting drunk. Fine, go ahead and leave. Go tell your daughter, how many children you orphaned to see her. Come on. Everyone, get in line. It's mealtime. How much longer to get to the IG's house? We are almost there. Sir, the truck crossed the first two toll points, but not the third one. Okay. Meaning the truck is somewhere between Sultanpur and Aihar. We must drop them at the hospital, and reach Laalganj. But we cannot use the highway. So we'll follow the map, and use the inner roads. Maps can be confusing, madam. It's nighttime. Kadchi says let's head to Unchahar, and from there, straight to Laalganj via Nahariya. Who is Kadchi? Call him. Kadchi is in front of you. Can trucks pass through that route? They are not allowed. But Kadchi has friends. We can get through by greasing palms. Take this 'Chammach' (Spoon) along. It's not 'Chammach'. Kadchi. -Hello, sir. -Hello. Deep Singh, why weren't you answering your phone? How could I, sir? I am busy pretending unconscious. If I get caught, this Diana will eat me alive. Is she still awake? Not just awake but also excited. She's brought all 40 with her. I wonder where she is taking them. Okay, fine. Listen to me. I am sending you a number. Keep sending them your location. Okay. I served them on a platter for you. All you had to do was grab them. But you are so useless. If you weren't Nithari's brother, you would be a watchman at a housing complex. Nepotism kids. I am giving you 500 million to find the consignment, not so you can screw me. Relax. Relax, Bahubaali. These aren't my words. The public will say this if you do nothing. Okay. Listen carefully. Your consignment has been located. Jai Hind, madam. How many men are on duty now? Four people on duty, madam. And a constable who is a new joinee. Is there anyone else, except for the criminals locked in jail? Four students. Do as I say. Ask for more backup from all neighbouring stations. Backup. Ma'am, you know the CM will be on a tour of Pratapgarh tomorrow. Everyone's busy there. Must be only a handful of cops in the stations. Just do as I said. The situation is critical. Get as much force as you can. And lock down the police station. I am on my way. It's an open contract. 100 million. If you do this, you'll never have to do anything ever again. There are five people on a truck. Cops. I want the witch alive. Alive. You can kill the rest. Everyone. These bloody cops are making a lot of noise. Let's show them their place. I've already shared pictures and details with everyone. 10 million for each head. And 50 million for the witch. Take a good look. Make no mistakes. Use the full might of your gang. Come, let's go. Go get that witch. We'll make her do her duty. Because she will tell us, who among you rascals is the informer. She will tell us. Location traced. Change the route. Rachna. Rachna. Listen. Papa, mummy, brother, sister, grandma, grandpa. What other relatives can there be? Can't you sleep? No. What happened? Who is coming to see me? I don't know. Listen. Maybe he will take you home. Home? Home. Do you have some nice clothes to wear? This one's nice. Hello. Can I speak to SI sir? He isn't here. He just left a while ago. He's at the IG office. His phone is unreachable at the moment. No officer at any station? Strange? Are you serious, Tomar? Shall we call Dial-100? What can Dial-100 do? Don't be a wise guy. If you have a death wish, then stay. I will deliver the medal personally. But if we don't stay, they will gut us in the inquiry. No, Chaubey. It always starts from the top. So let them deal with whatever this is. Shall we tell the students to leave? Let's not make things worse for us? If we tell them, it will be used against us in inquiry. Leave them to their fate. Bhura, you stay here. -Inform brother when he comes back. -Okay. And keep sending the details to all the hunters. They should have combed through the entire UP by tomorrow. Understood. Where are we going? The consignment's been located. Stop. Stop. Take a right. Madam, this is a truck, not a cycle. Why aren't we taking the highway? Just do as I am saying. Let's go. I don't think this road leads anywhere. Do you know better than the map? Madam, I deal with a dozen people like him every day. With your permission, Kadchi wants to speak. Speak, 'Belan'. It's not 'Belan'. It's 'Kadchi'. Are you dumb? Can't get the name right the first time? Kadchi says take a left. Take the Unchahar dirt road, which leads to the old highway. Straight to Fatehpur. Saves 20 kilometres. 'Patila' is right. Let's go this way. Chetan. See how much your sister-in-law loves me. Hearing I am at the police station, she came running at midnight. You idiot, she is your sister-in-law. Wise guy... I'll slap you both! Sit quietly. It's him. The inspector will be here any minute. Is there no one at the station? I don't see anyone. Sonny boy, are there no officers in the station? I don't see anyone, uncle. Sonny, there's a key hanging on the wall somewhere. Get it, son. We are stuck here too, boy. Like you are. Unnecessarily. Get it, son. And we can leave together. You sonny, in the cap! I am talking to you. Come here, sonny. Come on. What a cute kid. Come on. Come here, sonny. Son... where do you think you are going? Uncle, these guys were calling me? Have you lost your mind? Did your mind shrink with your body? Come over here. Hello. Yes. Did you lock the doors and windows? Now turn off the lights. And listen, do you have protection? Madam, you should be calling home. This is Laalganj police station. What? SP Diana speaking. Where is Mishra? Madam... Jai Hind. There is no Mishra here. The entire police station is empty. Empty? Is there no one? Who are you? I am constable Angad Yadav. I was transferred here today. But haven't joined officially, madam. What's your age? I just turned 55. So, Mr. Yadav, your duty starts now. Happy birthday. Thank you, madam. But, I am confused, madam. You are assigned to the Laalganj police station. -Yes. -Do you have a uniform? Yes, I have my uniform, but no gun. Uniforms are worn with courage, not a gun, Mr. Yadav. Yes, madam. Now listen. This is an emergency situation. We'll be there in two hours. Until then, don't let anyone in. Bolt all the doors and windows properly. -Now. -Yes, madam. And take down my number. Call me in case of an emergency. Yes. Bro... I am completely sober. Shall I make another drink? What about the cop? He won't need one. The bloody monster devoured 20 chickens first, and now my booze. Yes, Bhaiyyaji. I think they are on the old highway. Keep sending us their location. We'll handle the rest. Yes, Bhaiyyaji. Yes, madam. Everything's bolted. But I need a few men to help me reinforce the doors. Sir, why did you bolt all the doors and windows? Let us go. Whose voice is that? Just a couple of students, madam. One of them is a female. Should I let them go? No, no. No one leaves until we don't get there. -Take their phones as well. -Yes. -Who has a phone? -Why? Madam's orders. Give it. You can take it later. Done, madam. What next? Lock everything with their help, and turn off the lights. Yes, madam. Look, guys, I need to reinforce this door, using these chairs, tables and cupboards. Why should we help you? Look, uncle, we'll help you if you don't charge us. Yes, I will handle all that. Give me a hand. Can't you see how worried uncle looks? -Uncle, tell me what you need. -Help me lift this up, son. -Come on. -Is it your birthday? Give them a hand. Yes. Lift it up. Heave Ho! Pull. Pull. Pull. Lift. Lift it up. Lift it up. On the back! Pull. Lift it up. Lift it up. Lift it up. Lift it up. I've known no one beyond my mother. Never said or learned anything else. So why did you do it, mother? What are you doing at this hour? Uncle, please check the register, and tell us who is coming to meet Jyoti tomorrow. She isn't sleeping herself or letting us sleep. She gives me a headache. Does she want me to lose my job too? Leave. I told you no one here has a heart. Movies make them emotional, not us. God... Kadchi was trying to take a selfie, but the battery's dead. Do you know what a selfie is? Since you were in jail? How long were you in there? 2012? The world has changed drastically since. Dimwitted boys are jumping off cliffs to make videos on the internet. Gandhiji has officially turned pink and is worth 2000. Being positive is highly negative. TVs are getting flatter, and people are getting flabbier. People don't keep money in accounts anymore. They keep it in mobiles instead. Music these days are deafening. Sounds more obscene than melodic. But you wouldn't know about all this. How long can a piece of wall withhold? You have a phone. The jail wasn't on Mars. What about family? Are they on Mars too? I have a daughter. She's in the orphanage. Your phone's ringing. Who will call me? No one's answering. Hurry up, child. If the warden sees us, even I will get a scolding at this age. Once again. Okay, fine. Hurry up. Last time. Another call from the same number. Here. Speak here. Hello. Hello. This is Jyoti speaking. Are you coming to meet me tomorrow? How are you related to me? Hello. Can you hear me? Hello. I-- Hello. Can you hear me? Hello. Hello. Hold the steering. -Come here. -Quickly, madam. ♪ Bholaa! ♪ ♪ Bholaa! ♪ Boss. It's pretty dark inside. It's nighttime. Ought to be dark. Sir. A huge crowd has assembled outside. Madam. The deal was to drive. You never said it would be dangerous. Don't sacrifice my life in your battle. Found your phone? Should I call back? Hello. A child just called me. Who? A child just called me. Who are you? I... I am... He's the child's father. Put her on the line. I see... so he's the father. What kind of father are you? Sending a small child to the orphanage. Do you know what the condition here is? Can you put her on the line or not? No, she cannot talk. She's gone back inside. If you want to talk, then come tomorrow. After all these years, you thought of your child. Uncle, he was stuck in a distant land. Just returned today. What distant land? He abandoned his daughter. What fortune was he chasing after? Your daughter doesn't even have a blanket. She sleeps on the floor with 150 other girls. No fans either. Not to mention the mosquitoes. Uncle, can you show us his daughter? Maybe send a picture. He is pretty distressed, uncle. Try to understand. Wait. There must be a picture of the school function on the board. Let me check. Thank you, uncle. Thank you. Ashu has reached Laalganj station. Oh my, God. It's done. -Here. -Thank you. Come on. We got to leave immediately. She's in an orphanage even when her father is alive. The police get drunk and enjoy, and we give our lives to save them. They were given sedatives. They are not drunkards. They are all high-ranking officers. Listen... If anyone dies, you'll never see your daughter again. Know how to turn one's helplessness into opportunity. You used my daughter's name to compel me. What can you offer me to save these patriots? How much do you want? Tell me. A father who couldn't give any love for 10 years, hopes to give the world in a single night! Give me time to think. Madam, he's in such a miserable state. Completely shattered on the inside. You've been drinking, haven't you? Nice... If cops drink, they are patriots. If Kadchi drinks, he's an alcoholic. They sent the image. How do I open it? This thing belongs to the dark ages. Buy a new one when we make it out of here. The world's moving to 4G, and you are still stuck on 2G.

Now! Chaman, are you pregnant? Break it down! Yes. Bark. My biggest mistake was making a deal with you. You couldn't control an ordinary truck driver. Ordinary? Who on earth is he? Where did he come from? He squashed three of my gangs in a single night. And you think he's ordinary. Did he come from the jail or the gym? Listen... Your part is done. Get lost. I know what I have to do. Idiot. Brother, the door is unbreakable. Huh. Can't break the lock. How are you attacking it? Straight? Show me. Were you hitting it like this? That's wrong. You're confused with the basics. If this is the lock, don't strike it straight. Raise it to 75 degrees and... This lock is busted. Who else is having trouble breaking it? I am coming to give you a hand. Coming. Aah... Aah... No doubt someone from your narcotics department is working with them. Such a strong sedative isn't available easily. If the treatment doesn't begin within the hour, they will not survive. How much longer will you take? I don't know. These people are all over the highway. You know what, meet me at Mukteshwar temple, okay. Okay. I'll bring the doctors and ambulance along. We'll begin treatment in the ambulance itself. -And Diana. -Yes. Take care. Yeah. Bhura. Bhura. Those idiots cannot handle him. You deal with him. Okay? Raunak. I've sent Bhura to capture him. Okay. You go too. Who will take charge here? Ashwathama is still alive. A few toppers from the academy haven't received any postings yet. Maybe they are working undercover. I'll send you a list in some time. Ashu! Ashu! Stop. Stop. Stop. Ashu, can you hear me? Brother. Tell me... Ashu. Speak louder brother. I'm here... -Can you hear me? Over here-- -Wha... what? Only one constable and college students are here. -What? On the left. -On the left. The entire police station is empty... Move. Wha... what? Sir, he's howling to them about our situation. Sir... -I've an idea. Can I try something? -What?

They have turned the station into a battlefield. There are just five of us. Even the Pandavas were five, but fought the entire Mahabharata. Don't lecture me, mister. They have a large number of men, weapons and might. We have nothing. Battles are won with courage, not with numbers, might or weapons. Who are you? I am an ordinary man like you, sir. Who ended up in the wrong place at the wrong time. Tell madam that the children are terrified. There is a girl here with us. What do we do? The situation is out of control.

Why did you lock the doors? Did you lock it properly? Now give me the keys. -Keys. -No. Hit him. Hit him. Chetan. Hit the rascal. Check upstairs quickly. Are any of the doors open? Yes. Move him. Pull. Move. Catch him. Catch him. Leave him. Pin him. Pin him down. Hold his arms. -Pin him down. -I have this one. Come here. Wait. Hold him down! Tie his legs. This one is loose. Open it. Hello. Deep Singh, where are you? We stopped at Mukteshwar temple. Weren't you on the way to the hospital? How did you get to the temple? How would I know? That witch is unconscious. That's good. Kill her. What? Me? Sir... Sir... I told you I have a slip disc issue. If Diana makes it out alive, then we are all dead. You have to do it. You have no choice. Do it now! But... but... Sir... Listen, Raunak. We know where the witch is. Get to Mukteshwar temple. We put an end to this today. The number you've called is currently out of network. Brother. You squashed 70 guys in a single night. Who are you? Were you keeping count? Kadchi's job is to count plates. Kadchi is never wrong with numbers. Brother... tell me who you are. I was the guy who made headlines every day for wreaking havoc. Then one day, I met her. Life began to feel like a blessing. I quit everything. Everything. But as they say, One has reckoning to pay for his deeds.

Our separation was a punishment, which won't end till my last breath. I thought I'll stay in jail forever. Then one day, I found out that, she left behind another life, waiting for me more eagerly than death. So you haven't seen her since the time she was born. Brother, take Kadchi's advice. This is your chance. Get out. Don't be fooled by madam's slippery promises. Once she comes around, no one will care about you. These are cops-- That was too emotional. Kadchi will go answer nature's call. Madam. If anything happens to me, then give this to my daughter. Tell her it's from her father. I worked pretty hard in jail, to earn this. Why do people forget, there is a human being behind this uniform? Your pain is so similar to mine. I had a child. But the police officer overpowered the mother. Got shot twice, when I was pregnant. The wounds healed but, the pain is still there. You will give this to her in person, I promise you that. Once I unite you with your daughter, I can be at peace... probably. Here you go. Brother. The ambulance has arrived. Send me details of all the prisoners released from Naini jail today. Here. Drink some water. Specky. Does it pain? Did I hit too hard? I am sorry I slapped you. Listen. Listen. I love you too. Chetan! -What happened? -Chetan! Chetan! Leave him. Leave him. He's just a kid. Let him go. Stop fooling around you idiots. Slit his bloody throat. Leave him. Leave him. Chetan! -Chetan! -Chetan! -Chetan! -Chetan! -Chetan! -Chetan! Chetan! -Chetan! -Son. Chetan! Son. Chetan! Chetan! Chetan! Chetan. Chetan. Chetan. Chetan. Chetan... Hey, constable. Stop this madness. Give me the keys. There's much to do. His final rites have to be done. His family will shed tears for him. Relatives have to be informed as well. So close to retirement, why botch your uniform? Give me the keys. Give me the keys. You will live. Otherwise, everyone's going to die. "Constable makes human shield." "Young lad becomes the scapegoat." Ashu. Ashu, get up. What did you do with my Ashu? I won't spare anyone. Ashu. Ashu! Ashwathama! Sir, are you alright? Yes, I am fine. Fantastic. You guys leave. Close the door. Close the door, quickly. -Come... -Madam. Madam. Jai Hind. I feel better now, madam. I didn't drink too much. Just a few sips. And I was unconscious. But I am ready now, madam. What can I do? Let's go. Which part did you come from overnight? Turned this wasteland into a graveyard. Such bravado. Let's see you escape this time. Even this wasteland doesn't yield cowards. Brother... Brother... Brother... Aah... Aah... I've had enough. Tell me, witch. Tell me, witch. Where did you hide the cargo in the police station? Listen, witch. I am asking you politely. Tell me. -Tell me-- -Boss. Move. I will deal with her. Ma'am. Ma'am. Ma'am. I've a gun on the side. Take it. You shouldn't have come here, Raunak. Why did you come here? Why? Tell me something. When you joined two years ago, isn't this how you looked like...Raunak? Not Raunak. Abbas Ali. Academy Topper. 2016 batch. I've been snitching on your gang for two years. And you... Being Nithari's dog, you couldn't sniff me out. Yes. Boss, someone killed Ashu. Bring her along. She will tell us where the cargo is. Move. What do with him? Throw him in the well. Hello. This is Jyoti speaking. Are you coming to meet me tomorrow? How are you related to me? Hello. Can you hear me? Hello. Go... kill him. I forgot to tell you one thing about him. Like some miracle, every time he returns from the verge of death. He stops breathing, but that doesn't stop him. Armed with death, fiery breath, and raging blood he battles, like he's the harbinger of death himself. ♪ Bholaa ♪ ♪ Roams with a little desire ♪ ♪ In search of a time that's in the past ♪ ♪ Grows innocent with each heartbreak ♪ ♪ Even pain realises... ♪ ♪ Bholaa ♪ ♪ From head to toe, Bholaa is all heart ♪ ♪ From head to toe, Bholaa is all heart ♪ ♪ From head to toe, Bholaa is all heart ♪ ♪ From head to toe, Bholaa is all heart ♪ ♪ A mystery unveiled only by time ♪ ♪ From head to toe, Bholaa is all heart ♪ ♪ I want to feel alive today ♪ ♪ I wish I could die today ♪ ♪ Bholaa ♪ Die...
