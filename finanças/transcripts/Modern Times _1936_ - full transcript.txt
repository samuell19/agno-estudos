Your speaker, the mechanical salesman. May I introduce Mr. J. Willacomb Bellows, inventor of the Bellows Feeding Machine, a practical device which automatically feeds your men at work. Don't stop for lunch. Be ahead of your competitor. The Bellows feeding machine will eliminate the lunch hour, increase your production and decrease your overhead. Allow us to point out some of the features of this wonderful machine. Its beautiful aerodynamic streamlined body, its smoothness of action made silent by electroporous metal ball bearings. Let us acquaint you with our automaton soup plate, it's compressed air blower, no breath necessary, no energy required to cool the soup. Notice the revolcing plate with the automatic food pusher. Observe our countershaft double-knee action cornfeeder, with its synchromesh transmission, enabling you to shift gears by the mere tip of the tongue. Then there is the hydrocompressed sterilized mouth wiper. Its factors of control insure against spots on the shirt front, These are but a few of the delightful features of the Bellows Feeding Machine. Let us demonstrate with a worker. Actions speak louder than words. Remember, to keep ahead of you competitor, you cannot ignore the importance of the Bellows Feeding Machine. Section 5, give 'em the limit.
