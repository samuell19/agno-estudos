"Bruh" sound effect. *Chip crunching Hey, man, have you been in the kitchen today? Yea, why? Well, I thought you said you were going to do the dishes. *Robbie exhales "Gunshot" sound effects Nice! Level up! Whadduya think? Love it! Let's go! Go?! We have to pre-game first! Pre-game? Pre-game. Pre-game! Ahhhhhh! Clink! Woooo! Pre-game! *Vomits Pre-game! *vomits *Robbie beat-boxes Tyler: Okay... Okay... Okay... Okay... Tyler: Okay, okay- Robbie: That was supposed to be your starting point! Tyler: Oh, I know. I know! *Robbie beat-boxes Tyler: Okay, okay... Okay, Okay, Okay... The thing I'm best at is getting brain It's insane the way the cellophane around my dang wang Hangs like a chain! *Tyler and Robbie laugh That's it? That's how I end my album! which is coming out, it's called T and R Yea, all three sales of that one. *voice on phone: "I swear that's Tyler and Robbie!" Tyler: You guys would buy that, right? Robbie: Woah, dude, look at this. *voice on phone: "I think this is where they live!" Oh, that's so creepy, no. Guys, look. You know we love you. But I mean this- Rebbeca: It's true! He loves the fan more than me. It's true, we love you guys. But like, this is ridiculous- Wait, don't show that! Izzy: You're showing more people where you live, dumbass. I didn't show you guys that. I'll take that... Yea... you know... look. We love you guys. Seriously, we would kill for you. But... When you see us, don't be all creepy and stalkery about it. Come up and say hey. Tell us you like our videos! Especially in public, yo, that shit makes us look dope. That's true. And if these two need anything, it's an ego boost! You know what, babe, you're not wrong. In fact, the next 100 people to share our latest video... Get a follow! And we gonna like the hell out of your posts! Oof, I love that voice, can you do that more? Hell! All right, we will see you guys, later. Woooooo, all right, I need a shot, Rebbeca what do you want? You're not going to wait and see who shares the video? *Tyler and Robbie laugh. No, no, no, Rebbeca. You sweet, beautiful woman. No. No, that's not how things work. We just say those things to get traction for the videos. Works like a charm. That's true. You guys suck! No, no, no. We. We guys suck. I'm taking you down with me, gorgeous. Glad to be here. What's the deal with those shots? That's what I'm talking about. Robbie, what do you want? Vodka? Vodka. Izzy? Bathroom. Voice on Phone: What's up, Today, we're going to be doing something a little different. Blehhhh! We're scaring the hell out of random people! Let's do it! *Woman screams It's just a prank!! You okay? Yea. Yea, I just, um- You just need to tell him. Rip it off like a bandaid. I hate ripping off bandaids. I'm proud of you. And if Tyler isn't... He... can suck my dick. Oh, yea? Didn't know you had one. Oh, yea. Surprised it hasn't come up yet. Must be too busy looking at that face. That's a shame. Whatcha doing? Izzy was just... telling me about her dick. Oh, that's awesome, you finally told him. Good for you. Tyler: Very brave. Izzy: Thank you. No, no problem, good for you- Tyler- Nope, nope. Nope, nope nope nope. Unless the next words out of your mouth are "give me that shot", I don't want to hear it. I- Where's Izzy's? Rebbeca: Right here. All right, this one goes out to 200,000 followers- 207,000; last time I checked. 207,000. Holy shit. All right, here's to them, boys. Bruh. *All cheers and bruh Rebbeca: Bruh. Tyler: Yea, that's a bruh moment. You okay? Yea. Yea? Yea. So I was thinking for this first shot- Are you sure? Let me tell you first- Not about the shot, about being okay. You're acting really weird I'm not weird. You're being weird. Who you texting? My mom. Your mom? My mom. This sketch is kind of dumb. What? Like, "When bae wants to go camping" who the hell even says that? If you don't want to do this, we could always do something- Old Man: Hey! What the hell you doing? Hi! Do you... live here? I said... What the hell you doing? I'm going to take that as a yes. Sorry, my buddy and I were just shooting a short little sketch... um... yea! We didn't know anyone owned this property. Son. Everything's owned by somebody. So... Why don't the two of you boys just... Clear out. Before something bad happens. Yea. Yea, we changed our minds anyways. Don't really need this place. So fucking stupid. Robbie: Hey, man- Tyler: Not you... That fucking guy. Yea. Yea. Oh, check this out- I saw something on the explore page the other day... Check this out. It's uh... here! Oh yea, haha, that's so stupid. What? What? I mean it's obviously fake. Why does it have to be fake? Okay, look right here, look at this reaction. You can't tell me anyone would ever react like that. Okay, sure, yea. Maybe this one is fake, but it's like... It's a good idea. Maybe... Maybe we could try it. Do it for real. We could make it a series! I don't know if we could start a series... Why not? I'm moving. You're... I got an e-mail a few weeks ago From some manager in LA. And he said he was looking for new social media talent. Holy shit, that's so fucking cool, man. That's like... Wow! Okay, yea! It's a little short notice, but Rebbeca will understand if we have to- No, it's not... It's not we though. No, it's me. They wanted me. *Ringing noise# And bro, you gotta know that I asked about you. All right? I mean, if you want to move to LA, you can! It just won't be with me... What, do they have a say in who you fucking live with? Yea, they do. It's some apartment full of influencers- Influencers? Yea? Fucking hate that shit. It's not shit- No, it is shit. It is shit, okay? There are tiers to this thing, and social media comedian We're not the fucking top of the food chain, but we're not the bottom either. That's where your fucking influencers go! AGH! This is why I didn't wanna tell you. You okay? Yea. Yea? Yea. *Car starts# No, usually when we have an idea for a sketch We just take out our phones and film it. We feel like writing things down puts a damper on the whole... What would you say? Creative process. Ah, that's funny. Graddy 88 here says he can tell we don't write anything down. Who are you talking to? My mom. Hey, guys, Tyler here. Next week, instead of our usual sketch meme Your boy and I are gonna do something a little different. You know those fake pranks that've been floating around? Your boy Robbie and I are gonna do one of those, but for real! There's not a lot of people liking that. Oh no, look it's gonna be great, seriously. This is going to be a great idea, in fact: I already know who our first victim is! Robbie: What are you doing? Tyler: What am I doing? I am setting us up, for a cliffhanger! We're gonna see you guys, next time! What the hell, man? Tyler: It's a great idea! Robbie: It's not a great idea. And I told you, I don't wanna start a series. Okay, so it won't be a series. It'll be one great video, where we scare the hell Out of that fucking weirdo who wouldn't let us film in the woods. No, no, no. You're not serious. I am 100% serious. You fucking owe me. Yea, you promised me we were going to do a Tyler and Robbie movie And I don't think that's going to happen anytime soon. So... Lemme have a prank, please! Your pranks are high school shit, man. Okay? We have other sketch ideas. Yea, but we've done all that. I wanna do something different. With you, Robbie. Please. Pleeeeease. *high pitched voice# Please. Please sir, lemme, lemme have a da prank. Just a little bit of the praaaank. Oh, oh it's so cold outside, you're not letting a little prank boy in! He's gonna die of hypothermia! This is baaaad! Oh no, I can't breathe! Come on! Please? It'll be super dope, super fun. Can't wait to see what we do together. We're gonna make magic happen. Call us Penn and Teller. Except, we believe there's a god- Fine. Tyler: That's what got you? Robbie: Yea. Robbie: So, what's the idea- Tyler: We find this guy's house. I'm gonna run up to his door, bang on it, run away. Your original idea of a video is ding dong ditching? No, it's not ding dong- That's the beginning. You're gonna stay hidden, behind a tree or something Record it all, I'm gonna do it again, Bang on his door, run away- Robbie: That's ding dong ditch- Tyler: It's not ding dong ditch! Sooooo, after that. He's going to get really pissed off. When he gets pissed off And comes outside of his house... I'm gonna throw this through his window. What the fuck is that? It's a brick. You don't see anything wrong with this- No. No! Okay, look, worst case scenario, He calls the cops. And my alibi, Rebbeca says we were with her all day. Uh huh. And best case? We get a new follower, way outside our usual demographic. Come on, this is gonna be great, dude. Watching someone go crazy? Now that's a video! You're throwing the brick. Wouldn't have it any other way. You got your phone? Robbie: yes, I have my phone. Tyler: Great. Sup, guys, today we're going to be pulling a prank On someone who's made our lives a living hell. Wouldn't let us film in his house! That's right! And that's all it takes! That's why, you don't mess with Tyler, and his best friend, Robbie- Robbie: Shit! Robbie: He's right there- Tyler: I know, I see him too... Robbie: Do you think he sees us? Tyler: Give me that! I told you to stay away. I thought I made that clear. It's just a prank, bro. And we're recording this, so don't do anything- Don't do as I'm told? Don't stay away when I'm told? Don't care for anyone's opinion but yours? Tyler: Calm down! Calm down? Don't tell me to calm down! Robbie: Run! *Gunshot fires# Tyler: Robbie... Hey, it's Natalie. I just want to give my condolences *More voices join, wishing Robbie's family well, giving condolences, saying he was taken too early* ...and the space will never be the same without you. What? Nothing. I was- I was going to go get us some dinner. What do you want? Whatever you want. Lee Palace? Okay. Um... You talked to Izzy? Tyler... You talked to Izzy. Number six, right? *Heartbeat pulses# *Phone loudly buzzes and rings# Tyler: Shit! Hey, Rebbeca... Sorry... no, that's fine. If they don't have that... Maybe you can... Do they have those- what are those little chicken things? With the orange sauce? I don't remember what they're called... I think they're- *Kitchen window shatters# Rebbeca on phone: What the hell was that? Hey... everything okay? *Sounds of urine splashing against a car rim* What are the odds... You run into Machi's Pizza shop And start telling people, he uses human shit in his calzones? Come on, bro. What are the odds! My brother works there! That's how you know, each and every calzone Is jam packed with doo doo! One in fifty. Count it off! One... Two... Oh shit! You're that guy! Tyler! Funny shit man- Can we get a picture? No. Oh come on, bro- I'm busy. Whatever. Robbie's the funny one anyway. What are those? Fake cigarettes? Maybe. Maybe try real cigarettes. Maybe your parents get lucky, maybe you get lung cancer. Bro, what? Forget it. Faggots obviously in a hurry to go slam cheeks with Robbie. I'm serious- That was so fucked up for you to say. Rebbeca... Rebbeca- No! I saw him- I saw- Was that before or after you tried to slice up those kids? Don't you- No really, what the fuck was that? They wanted a picture. They wanted a picture? I am so sorry You didn't tell me they wanted a picture. You didn't even mention them wanting a picture. I am so sorry for thinking you were out of line. I think we should call the cops. This is not about them- It needs to be. Look, it sucks. What happened to Robbie. I hate it. You hate it. Izzy hates it- Izzy hates it. And I know you wish she'd come around more, But she has to process this in her own way, we all do. But it's not your fault. Like you said, it was Robbie's idea to mess around with that guy. Just... try not to process it by punching people in the face. Okay? Even if they're complete wangs? Yes. Even if they're complete wangs. Psychos like you are the reason I keep a gun in my purse. You know what? What? Those kids probably threw that brick- No. Yea, I mean what were they doing that close to the apartment anyways? I don't know, maybe they live nearby. They knew it was you immediately. They probably saw you showing where you live on live stream- Don't bring that up. It's weird. Is all. And it's more believable than- It is. So just... take your time. Process it. Don't hold it in. Because if you do that... You'll see Robbie forever. You still down to shoot that sketch tomorrow? *Toilet flushes# I don't know... It's been two weeks. Yea, I know... I've shot like thirty sketches. I don't wanna put out something that sucks and it's just me. So shoot something with me! That way... If it sucks, you can blame me. But if it's totally amazing, I can steal all your spotlight and take the credit. That sounds fair. Yea? Yea. So you going to move? Why? I need to wash my hands. You're going to wash your hands now, after touching me all over? I can touch your face a little more- They're wet! How do you miss with the toilet paper? I didn't miss! That's disgusting! Dinners ready! Great, I'm starving! It's not that bad! *Bruh sound effect# Who are you, Gordon Ramsay? It's *#*#*# dreadful! *Bruh sound effect# It's raw! *Heavy breath# Rebbeca: Hey! I just got an e-mail from- You okay? Yea. I just got an e-mail from someone who wants to sponsor our next post! What? I know! Why? Because they like the content, I guess? Are you serious? You read the comments, right? Yea, it's cancer, like always- -No this one's worse. Who cares? More comments means more views. And more views means more people asking to sponsor a post for a 3 second shout out! I don't know if I wanna do a sponsored thing. Why? It's like selling out. You sell hoodies with your face on them. That's- That's different, that's merch- -How? Because... the... The idea of a- You have someone who wants to pay you to do what you love. Don't be stupid. I'm not stupid. Prove it! Look, it's silly, but when people see sponsored whatever It makes them think you're more official. And I know it doesn't Make any sense, because the same people will tell you that you're selling out, but... It's not about the selling out... I- I dunno. Whatever. I'm telling them you'll do the shoutout. Ooh, Rebbeca! I texted Izzy... She's not super eager to see you. Yea, I know. Do you think, maybe you could text her for me? Tyler- Izzy! What the hell, man? Hey, how are you? Tell Rebbeca she's on my shit list now, too. Look, she didn't have anything to do with this- Back off! I just want to talk. Okay? What? How are you? Bad question. I'm trying to be friendly. Good job, really. What is your problem? What is my problem? Yes, what is your problem? Seriously, I get that you're in pain, or whatever, but that doesn't give you an excuse to take it out on me. Do you hear yourself? You, you, you. It's always about you, and I don't know if you've noticed, But you're not really that great, Tyler. Robbie thought you were. Rebbeca obviously thinks you are. I used to think so. You do. You think your hot shit. And that's great! I wish my ego was as big as yours, honestly. Cool, I'm a narcissist. Sociopath, fits better. Why- Wanna tell me what you told everyone else? Because I still haven't heard it from you. I heard what Rebbeca said you said. I heard what the police said you said. But I... want to hear it from you. This obviously wasn't a good idea. You said it was Robbie's idea to go shoot in that part of the woods, right? You said the plan was to fuck around and film some dumb sketch, not harassing anyone. You said that Robbie threw the brick at that old guy's head after he pulled a gun out and then got shot right before he bled out. That's right, Izzy. I said that. You also said you didn't film anything yet. Didn't even turn the camera on. You told the cops that, hm? The cloud, asshole. You filmed everything on Robbie's phone, and then deleted it before you called the cops. Yea? But I saw it. Are you going to tell anyone? Always about you. Unbelievable. And that gives you an excuse to throw shit through my window, huh? And that fucking Robbie account you made, that was ridiculous. You have problems, you know that? Real- I'm the one with- I mean it! I don't know what you're talking about. For real. And I'm not going to tell anyone. Because that shits tearing you up inside, and honestly I'd be happy if it made you blow your brains out. *gagging and choking sounds# How's it going today? It's good. What? Nothing, just um... Really- really hate this. Not like- just- The whole "therapy" thing, you know? Yea. You nervous? No. Okay. Let's get started. Tyler. Tell me about yourself. uh... well... I guess you could say, I'm in "new media"? Yea, I've seen some of your stuff. Yea, you a fan? Not really my type of thing. But I respect you're out here doing something you love. Not Many people can say that. Yea. And, at times, what I find is that The idea of having to be happy doing something you love Means you have to be happy with your life. Which also makes you feel like... You don't- You don't have a right to feel sad... or mad... Oh, I feel mad. Not like- Not like a lot or anything. I- I feel the right amount of mad. You know? Okay. s'cool. Yea. So, um... Robbie. The guy you do the videos with. Pretty funny. Yea, yea. He um... Ahhhhh! Okay, nice game. Nice game. Well fought, well fought. Preciate it, thank you. Noooo! AHHH! Yeaaa boi! Well fought, well fought. I just have to agree... You never let me freaking win! Anything! He was. Now, listen. If Robbie isn't something you're ready to talk about yet Let me know. It's fine, I understand these things take time- No, no. We should. The sooner I talk about him, the sooner... I get better. Yea? Right. So. So what do you want to know? Tell me anything. About your working together, your relationship- He was kind of an asshole. How so? All right, so... Example. He had this idea for a skit- Recently? No this is like, years ago. We would go into different restaurants And we'd order like a lot of food. Like apps, entrees, desserts, everything. And based on how good the food was, and how good the service was We'd give them a rating. Bad, okay, good, great. Based on the rating they got, Robbie's idea was to pay in different types of coins. So like, so like- If everything was bad. Pay in all pennies. If it was okay, nickles. Good, dimes, great- Quarters? You'd think so, but no. No, Robbie's idea was to leave the waitress our phone numbers. If she was cute. And if it was a dude... we'd just kind of... Book it. And this is funny? No, I- I guess not. So, Robbie got you involved in these pranks- Well, they're not "pranks". Harassment. Nope. And that makes him an asshole? I said kind of an asshole. And yea. Okay... well... Why'd you feel you had to do that kind of content with Robbie? I don't know. We were friends, you know? And how did your parents feel about the videos- That is a whole separate issue. How about we make it this issue, yea? So, you say a few years ago. You're young. I assume you were making the videos while you lived with your parents? Yea. Yea, but they didn't know about the videos, okay? Yea, okay. Yea, seriously. They didn't, okay? They weren't a factor in me and Robbie's thing, they weren't a factor in me- So, you're not close with your parents? I was close. I was fine. I was a healthy distance from my parents. Yea, seriously! Like, like- Me and my dad... Sometimes it was... And, and- my mom... Wow. That's gotta be like 30 minutes right there- Actually, you still have 22 minutes- Goddamn it, really? Sweet. It's okay, you don't have to be here- Shut up... *phone alert sounds off# What? It's nothing... Is everything okay? Honestly, no. I've been part of a nasty divorce for over a year or so now. I'm sorry... Yea, it sucks. Which is... Why, I think... It got so bad between us- Because I pushed him away. Kept pushing things on him. It started with the little things. You know, dishes not being washed; cats not being fed. It became a habit. Every time something bad or negative happened in my life I found a way to exclude myself. To push any and all blame away on everyone else. And because we're- We were married, it was usually him. I remember this one time, we Invited our neighbors over for dinner. And it was a big deal for him. We had been in our new apartment for a few months now And we wanted to have some company over. For a while we'd been wanting to do that. You know? Do the "adult" thing. Sounds terrible. Yea... That's why, I think, I drank a half a bottle of whiskey Before my husband came home for dinner. He was pissed. Really, pissed. We canceled the dinner. I could barely stand up. How did you pin that on him? I said, that he was pressuring me. Putting too much pressure on me, a recovering alcoholic. He kept making me wear this costume This idea of the man that I should be in front of everybody else. I had no choice but to go out and buy that bottle. Sheesh. Yea. Yea. Um... Tyler. Do you- do you have anyone special in your life? Yea. Yea. My girlfriend. Rebbeca. Rebbeca? Tell me about Rebbeca. She's great. She puts up with me. That's it right there. What? You just said it, she puts up with you. That's just something people say, it's not like a- Tell me how she puts up with you. She... How are you a burden to her? She- -Start with I. I... Say things sometimes. Or I think things. And I'm able to talk about those things with her. And it helps. What types of things? I don't know... like... Like sometimes... I just wanna... Hurt something, you know? Not like in a bad way, just like- You know, it's... No... It's not even me that wants to do it. It's like it's my body, telling me that it wants me to do it. Your body is telling you to hurt yourself? No! It's not telling me to hurt myself- I don't want to hurt anyone- Just... forget it. That was dumb. Tyler, it's fine. Nope. It's not going to come out right. It doesn't have to- -Yes it does. It's okay, look... Sometimes I just... Just wanna break someone's bones, you know? Shit... It's okay. Holy shit. I forgot- I actually have a thing... I'm gonna go to that. This has been great- -Tyler, don't- Tyler, Tyler, it's okay! Just have a seat- I am so sorry... It's okay... No... no, I can't- Tyler, it's okay. No, it's not okay. Why is it not okay? I do this all the time, I hurt people... Tyler, I'm fine- -Not you! Everyone! You know that story I told you about me and Robbie paying with change? That wasn't his idea, that mine. It's going to be- -No, No! It's not going to be fine! That was an asshole thing to do. You said it yourself. I am an asshole! No, yes I am! I am a gaping asshole, who should just blow a hole In his fucking skull right now, because everyone hates him, and he just hurts everyone Around him. What do you- -What do you mean- Everyone hates me! Rebbeca, Robbie, Izzy, everyone of them- My mom! Why does your mother hate you, Tyler? It doesn't matter. She hates me for the same reason everyone hates me. Because no matter how hard I try to change... Or what I do... I'm just an asshole. New voice: Tyler. Let's get started. Eyo man, have you seen my toothbrush? *Bruh sound effect# Robbie: Ah, man. That was a good one. Yea, it was a good one, but like, there's no way it's your favorite. I mean, maybe not my favorite, but that's the first one we did where we figured out how to make the camera move without shaking it. Oh god, the shaking. What, you didn't like the earthquake cam? No, I loved the earthquake cam. It screamed professionalism. I loved it when it gave people seizures. We should do a sequel to this one! What? You know, we could start a series or something... Yea... um... Yea that's really cool- I think we should focus more on the um... The... like the individual sketches. That seems to be working for us right now- Yea? Yea... Yea. Oh, check this out! I sent an email to a management company in the city, called Sky Talent. I said we would be a kick ass edition to their team. -And I really hope you didn't actually say kick ass. No! Of course I didn't say "kick ass" to a management company. That would be unprofessional! And, for no reason! I'm going to send them a follow up- Just... to clarify a few things... "No reason". What would you say if they just wanted you? What? If they just wanted you. And not us. As a team? What would you say? Nope. Of course not- -Really? Yea, no. Are you kidding me? That's a hard pass. That's a deal breaker. You know I wouldn't be mad if you went and joined a team without me, right? I know you wouldn't be mad. I don't know, it's like... we're a team, dude. It's Tyler and Robbie! We're brothers! Metaphorically speaking. We're not actually brothers. That's impossible, because of the- um... The height difference- Yea the height. That's the one. I'm so much taller than you. We could never be related- You're fucking huge, dude. When are the girls getting back? I don't know, man. They need to hurry up. We need to start this live stream before our audience's bed time. You're looking way too much into that last post's insights- Oh, no no. I am reading the insights correctly! We need to know who we are speaking to. And who we are speaking to, just so happens to be 9 to 12 year olds. Apparently! Which is great! I'm not insulted. Just... honored to be a third grader's hero. That's always what I wanted to be- We're just leaders of the jamboree apparently. Well, I'm gonna go ahead and set up. Oh, do you think... Maybe you could do a little beat box thing for me? Yea, I wrote some lines, I want to try and make it seem like I freestyle it On the live stream. Yea? You got it, man. Thanks, I'm gonna go set up. *Robbie's phone vibrates* Hey. Hey... How'd your thing go- I didn't hear from you last night... Yea... I was out with Izzy... Yea? Yea. How was the thing? Good. Yea... I didn't really vibe with it well, though. So probably won't be going back, but.. I think it'd be good for you to just- I don't know. I didn't really feel "right" about it, so... Maybe if you just tried again- Really wasn't a good fit. I have good news! Yes! Good news, great, what's up? Do you remember "Sky Talent"? That management group in the city. Yes. Well... They sent a message to our profile- Our profile? Yea, you're taking me down with you, remember? They sent a message to our profile, and they like the content and Want to set up a meeting! That's... great. Can't tell... Look happy? Look something besides this? This is good news- Plus we have that sponsored post coming up we have to shoot... Don't wanna do that. Don't wanna do what? The post... or the meeting... any of it. You're joking... Okay... So, I'm gonna go. Have a drink or two. Collect my thoughts. And when I get back, You're gonna say "thank you so much, babe! For always doing what's best for my career, and trying to push it forward. Okay? It'll be crazy. *"Bruh" is whispered in a deep voice* No, no, no- Robbie: It's okay, dude! No, I do not want this- -Ah, but you need it- No, what I need is- What you need, is to hear your friend say... That it's not your fault. But it is. And now you're here... and I'm not. Did you do it on purpose? Take me back to that place, so that I wouldn't be able to make it to LA? Or maybe you thought something would happen to you? You were the one who threw the brick. You were the one who was supposed to knock on that crazy fucker's door over and over again. You knew something was wrong with the guy. And this stupid prank, this shit had "murdered by a crazy old guy in the woods" Written all over it. Was it just some... pathetic suicide attempt? Because you had the brick, too. You wanted him to fight back. Just went after the wrong guy, I guess. Fuck, I mean it's not my fault the black guy always dies in the movie first- Oh my god- -What, it's true! No. This is not a fucking movie. You sure? Murder, Angry ex's I mean, you always wanted to entertain. You're an asshole. Ha! You are. Robbie isn't even here. This is all you. Just crazy Tyler, having a conversation with himself. Confronting his own demons. It's beautiful, really. So are you gonna finish what you started? *Tyler sniffles off screen# I have made a severe and continuous lapse in my judgement. And I do not expect to be forgiven. I am... I am simply here to apologize. And to... To... make amends... To try my best to... solve the problems that me and everyone around me have been having lately. And I was thinking, how do I do that? How do I fix a problem- How do I fix a problem like... fucking me? *Rebbeca knocks at door# *Rebbeca calls out to Tyler for the rest of the live stream* And I know this is like so fucking terrible It's just the worst fucking thing anyone could do. It shits on this absolute gift we've been given to live- and it shits on everyone around us who has to pick up the pieces after we're gone. *Rebbeca's knocks and screaming grows louder* Wow... Everyone's right. I really am an asshole. Robbie? *Door opens# Rebbeca: Is the camera off? Tyler (chuckling): Yup. *Bruh sound effect#
