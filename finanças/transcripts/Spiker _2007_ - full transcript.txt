(Eerie Music) Good morning, Peconic Bay. Don't be fooled, even though the sun is out it looks like we're going to be stuck with this cold front for a few more days. Hey, that's Long Island weather for you, always a test of our endurance. But more on the weather with Reggie Templeton at quarter past the hour. The big news we're following at the top of this hour is that of Adam Brandis. Almost all islanders remember him by his more infamous name, the Spiker. For those of you who do not know who he is. He's a serial killer who gained worldwide notoriety. Police are still uncovering bodies, or what's left of them. After twenty years in prison, some whacko judge determined that Adam Brandis can be rehabilitated. Just our luck, huh? Today he's being transferred from the state pen to a high security asylum. So if you're traveling on the roads in the vicinity of the South Ferry, please... give the Sheriff a clear path. The sooner we have this maniac... off our roads, well, the better. More updates later. Listen, on a brighter note, Mattituck High School, homecoming game tonight. Go Mattituck! [Sirens] Let's go. (Ominous Music) Sit in the chair. He's in your custody now, boys. Doc. Sheriff Paxton. Your pen. The transfer is official. He's in our custody now. He should have fried. Not according to the judge. We can help him here. Yeah, some life: padded cell, electro shock therapy, peach slices in light syrup every single day. He should be dead, Scotty. Look, Leo. I don't know what moron at state drew our names for this transfer duty, but it's messing with your head. You've got to let it go, chapter closed, ok? What the hell's the matter with him? But he lands on our doorstep. Not two miles from here. -Ah! He's in grand mal seizure. He's going into cardiac arrest. Get the defibrillator. Unlock him! -No way. Give me your Goddamn key. I wouldn't do that, Doc. With all this metal, \N the charge will arc. -Then let him die. (Intense Music) He's not worth it, Doc! Clear. Again. [Screaming] [Gun Shots] Down on the ground now! Leo! Down on the ground now! Leo! Are you ok? Yeah. I'm ok. -All right. Be ready. Be ready because he's going to come up. He never came up! I hit him. He never came up. -I know I hit him. Goddamn it to hell! Dive squad, dive squad, come in. This is Sheriff Paxton, over. Roger, Sheriff, your signal is five by five. You guys got anything? My divers just hit the search grid, Sir. We went in at daybreak. Have the shore search teams arrived yet? Your two deputies are already working the south beach. We have two volunteer teams arriving shortly. We're gonna be walking the spit on the south side of the bay. Put someone in a boat on the shoals as well. I don't want that body floating out into the ocean while we swim in circles inside the bay. I'll get someone on that, Sheriff. Out. -Paxton out. [Radio Static][Phone Ringing] Morning, Claudette. Morning, Leo. How you doing? Fine. Coffee, please. I turned it on this morning and something popped. Scott said he's getting coffees at Reggie's. Why doesn't he just buy a new one or is it not in this year's budget? Mrs. Kaminski called already this morning. Oh, the school kids or Harrison's dog? Dog. Flower bed. I'll put Scotty on that one. Thanks, buddy. I appreciate it. -Oh, you're welcome. Leo. This is Officer Brown. He's head of the Nassau County diving team at the ferry location. Glad you're on site. What's the situation? We're initiating the grid search in an hour or so. Heading north to north east following the prevailing currents and we'll move close to the shore with the tide. There's no reports of any bodies washing up yet. With the size and depth of that bay and the tides at the time of the incident, the possibility of finding a drowning victim is marginal. I need the body. Listen, if you're looking for confirmation of death, Sheriff, be assured your prisoner could not have survived. An exposed male would freeze to death in ten minutes in that water. After all this town's been through, I need the body. Well, Sonar and divers on a grid search can only go so far. We're gonna do our best. -I don't want your best, Agent Brown. Look. This guy, he murdered twenty-seven local people. And he just tore their bodies apart with railroad spikes. -Twenty-seven bodies confirmed. We're not even sure of a real body count yet. Believe me, I know the story of the Spiker. Well then you know how important it is that we actually find him dead. Yes. -If we don't fish his corpse out of that bay, then there is no closure for this town and this town deserves better than that. Listen, I can prove... -No Goddamn it, just find me the body! Leo. I'm out of here. Adam Brandis is dead. That's all that matters now. You've been up all night. Why don't you go get some sleep? I'll get some later. Hey, Scotty. Thanks. You got it. Hey you! You! I want some satisfaction around here! That mangy dog is digging up my bloody daffodils and I want him dead. I want that mangy pup put down, now. Sure thing, Mrs. Kaminski. Stop it. Thank you. You have a nice day, Mrs. Kaminski. You too. ♪Time passes by.♪ ♪Oh, you try to tell you...that time will just...♪ Not here, you nasty boy. Why not? -Cause' everybody can see us.

Hey guys! Hi. Mh. -What's up, man? Can I have a sip of that? Charmed, slut. We ready to roll? Oh, yeah. Nice, right? Hey. I'm not stopping the car every fifteen minutes for you to pee on the way up. I can hold it better than any guy I know. I can attest to that. The Mayor's daughter has a bladder like a beer keg. Can we go? Relax, Charlie. Erin and Gary aren't even here yet. Yeah, calm down. To hell with the vampire, they're late. Don't call her that. -What? Little miss Dracula freaks me out. You have to admit she is a touch demented... in a retro-goth kind of way. She's our friend. Not mine. Bad luck to leave people behind. There. See? She freaks me out. Hey! Hi, Gary. Sacred lilac. Took a lot of work to find these. What do we need those for? To cleanse the space for the séance. Séance? To communicate with Lisa's... ancestors. And maybe even Spiker... since they popped and dropped him last night at the bay. Erin, let's skip the Spiker stuff, ok? It's ok, Mikey. Yeah, Mikey. He's dead. That's the only reason she's letting us go up there in the first place. And he's fresh meat so it'll be very easy to communicate with him. I said skip the Spiker crap. Listen. I'm all into the haunted house idea and stuff, just as long as it doesn't interfere with the partying. Ok? [Laughs] Yeah, Morticia, pack your candles and your moon rocks and let's go. Hey show a little class, Quartermain. You gonna make me? New York pussy! Yeah, I love you, too, babe. You're a freak of nature, man. I want to fuck you up. -Charlie, stop it, man. Let's go. Hey, Frankie, usual, buddy. You got it. -Hey, look who it is, hero man. My uncle Scott. The man who single handedly killed the Spiker. Yeah, thanks but it was actually Sheriff Paxton who shot him, not me. Details. What are you guys doing, going on a little camping trip? Yeah, um. I'm just showing Mike some of the equipment I got. You guys want to do some real camping, you let me know 'cause I have a place upstate you'd love. Trout fishing is unbelievable. Yeah,we'll look into that. -Ok. Yeah. Bet on it. -Ok. Don't leave on my account. Bye, Uncle Scotty. Hero man. Let's get started. I don't want to drive up there in the dark. What's the matter stud, chicken?

This house is a gold mine. We just got the energy rolling. Now we just got to shake it up a bit. I don't get it. What's the deal with the Spiker dude? You're kidding, right? I'm not from around here, remember? He was a serial killer, a real hall of famer. He killed twenty-seven locals in a five-year killing spree before they caught him. There may have been more victims, actually. They still find a body every once in a while under the railroad tracks. Train tracks? Yeah. He, uh, killed people with railroad spikes. And he would bury their bodies under the railroad tracks. They say Lisa's aunt was his first victim. And that he pushed her in front of a moving train. Crazy. I've been out here a few times... on the full moon to try to see the ghosts, but I've never been lucky enough to make a sighting. You're really into this, aren't you? Yeah. And later I'm gonna have another séance. And this time we're going to have a little chat with the Spiker. Why do I go out with you? Because I'm so incredibly hot. Oh.

He never spoke another word after that. And then he came on our wedding night. Somehow I knew that he would come. And he confronted us.
