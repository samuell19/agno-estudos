(BIRDS CHIRPING) (RAGGED BREATHING) (BIRDS WHISTLING) (SOFT GROANING) MARIUS: Where is she? I'm gonna shoot you in the head, boy. Tell me where Suzanne is and I'll only shoot out one of your eyes. DANNY: Stop fucking around, Marius. (GROANS) Maybe you would like it if I went back inside and finished her off first, Will. Is that what you'd like? Five seconds. One, two, three, four... Okay. We're done here. (GUNSHOT) (MUFFLED LAUGHTER) (HELICOPTER WHIRRING) ANNIE: Uncle? Can you hear me? It's Annie. I need you to know what happened. WILL: It's okay. It's like always. Breathe in, stop your heart. Let go. (GUNSHOT) ANNIE: So do I pass? WILL: Not bad, not bad. Well, nothing wrong with the scope, Uncle. For a gun from this century. Anyone can shoot one of those. I wanted you to use a real gun. - A moshum's gun. - All right. Just like those traps of yours from the museum or something. Pile of rust. Hey, nothing wrong with my traps. Collector's items. They got some on sale at the store this week. Eh, my girl, nothing wrong with my traps. ANNIE: Eva's here. EVA: Hey, guys! WILL: Hey, Eva. I just came to say that somebody better get her bags packed. - Hey? - Your, like, totally amazing, best friend ever, just won at Bingo! I just bought us a trip to Toronto! - We leave tomorrow. - (EXHALES HEAVILY) What's that look? I can't go to Toronto. It's my treat, dummy. It's on me! I told your mom we could go see your lawyer. What for? So he can tell us how he calls the cops every week? Tells us that on the phone. Sometimes it's good to make a man look you in the eyes. EVA: Thought you'd be excited. I am, for you. You're saying you're not going to go? Gotta get this moose out of the truck. Take your sister, okay? You guys'll have a great time. Annie. (CLOSES DOOR) Well, what the hell am I gonna find out? - Eva was just trying to help. - (SIGHS) (GRUNTS) Your mother wants to go down. When did she say that? Last week. As if. She couldn't even get off the train. I'm gonna take her. You're not even funny, Will. What, you think I can't figure it out? We'll go see that lawyer. Then we'll go shopping. I'll take her up that CN Tower. You can stop now. Oh, and that new aquarium, 'cause it's right next door to the CN Tower. Saw it on TV, they got this... "Dangerous Lagoon" thing. Fucking Suzanne. Don't talk about her like that. And maybe I can get me another one of these. Mmm. A baseball cap. It says "Toronto" on it. Joe's sister gave it to me. Can't find this craftsmanship just anywhere. Mmm. You know what? I don't want her to go. I... I... I just think it's a bad idea. No one's forcing her to go, Lisette. (INDISTINCT) WILL: Look, someone's gotta go. Besides, she wants to go. (THUDS) (TRAIN HORN BLOWING) (SOBBING) LISETTE: What if Annie doesn't come home? WILL: Hey, hey, come here. It's okay. (CLICKS GUN) (BEAR GRUNTING) (VEHICLE APPROACHING) Fuck, Will, just fucking do it. She's blind and she's old. She's no trouble. You want to play with bears, you dumb fuck, go do it someplace else! My kid and my house are 10 minutes from here. I'm telling you, - she's no trouble... - (GUNSHOT) What the fuck, man? (GROANS) MARIUS: I came here to have a chat and you get all fucking Grizzly Adams on me. So where's Suzanne? - We don't know. - You don't know? Annie fucks off to Toronto 'cause you don't know. Eva won at Bingo, she took her on a vacation. (GROANS IN PAIN) MARIUS: Why the fuck do I have to keep repeating myself? We both want the same thing. We find Suzanne, we find Gus. We find Gus, we find Suzanne. Right? (YELLS) Right? It's only a vacation, they'll be back in a week. (BREATHING HEAVILY) Okay, Will... We'll chat when she gets back, eh? But you keep snitchin' to the cops, I'll fucking kill you. I didn't. (GROANS) You fuck. WILL: Ah! (COUGHS) (GROANS) (ENGINE STARTS) (BEAR GROWLING) There you go, sister. Moose stew. Yeah. Here we are at our hotel. (EXCITEDLY) We're here in Toronto! Aren't you so excited? Yeah. ANNIE: Big city girls, now. EVA: Oh, look at this big room! - This is it. - This is it. We gotta send this to your mom, okay? - Hey, Mom. - Hi, Mom. I mean, hi, Lisette. Hi, Uncle Will. EVA: This is so cool, Annie. - Oh, my God! - Yeah. - New haircut? Yes? Like, yeah? - ANNIE: Yes. You're just like Marilyn, yeah. I ain't a nurse no more. Not tonight. I'm Marilyn Monroe. ANNIE: No scrubs here. Okay. You go do Marilyn. - ANNIE: I'm not going... - EVA: No. Okay. But... Good try. I... EVA: And this is the last address Annie had for Gus and Suzanne. And I think that's the landlady. Just stop that, okay. - EVA: Stop. - ANNIE: Stop it. So what did she say? Anything? ANNIE: Yeah. She said she thought Gus was an asshole. Wow! Like, breaking news. I know, right. (LAUGHS) God. It was just like it was back home before she left. And I'm running around looking for Suzanne. - Annie. - Ugh! - Why does she keep doing this to my mother? - I know! I know she can be a pain in the ass. I was there. ANNIE: Ugh, she makes me sick. EVA: Now let's go get that mani-pedi. - ANNIE: Why does she live in this neighborhood? - EVA: Yeah. It's so far from downtown if you're gonna live in Toronto. - Gotta take the subway everywhere... - MAN: Suzanne, Suzanne... Eh? (MUMBLING) Yay, that's her sister, eh? (BOTH LAUGHING) Yeah. LEO: How is she? I don't know. I haven't seen her in a while. Yeah, us too. Uh... A year, maybe. Well, how was she then? She was doing, uh, the mod... Modeling. Gave Martha here some clothes... (LAUGHS) Hey, you and your friend, you should come to our feast tomorrow night. It's under the gardener dump by the Don river. Can't. We're leaving in the morning. LEO: Oh, that's too bad. We could... We could use some more girls around the fire. (LAUGHING) EVA: We're gonna go. We have an appointment. Annie! LEO: Eh, hogwash. (SWITCHING CHANNELS ON TV) Just tell me what it is you're gonna do. I'm gonna check some things out. I thought "we" did that. (WOMAN ON TV) The rainy season begins... He said they haven't seen her in, like, a year. You told me you only brought 200 bucks with you. How long you figure that's gonna last? So when the money runs out I'll come home. Annie, that's just stupid. COMMENTATOR 1 ON TV: Very comfortable in that short yardage unit. (REPORTER SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY) COMMENTATOR 2 ON TV: Giants to center. Jones spins and shoots. (SWITCHES CHANNELS) (SIRENS BLARING IN DISTANCE) (DOOR OPENING) MAN: Well, I'm about to now. I'll talk to you later. Wow! She had a real career, eh? I guess. She must have been a big deal back home, then. Let me print one of these out. ANNIE: Maybe this will be better. Oh, okay. So, when was the last time you heard from her? ANNIE: Eight months ago. She didn't really keep in touch. Sent my mother money sometimes, or lame postcards, or just pictures of herself. Stuff like that. When she disappeared for almost a year, things were pretty bad between her and my mom, so... Mmm. Okay. Well, here, have a seat. How did you find out that she was missing? Uh, the cops came to us. They had the "Missing Person's" report from Toronto. And when was that? Three months ago. Do you know who filed the report? They said it was anonymous. I think it was Gus. The boyfriend, that's who she came down here with. And no one's heard from him either? His cousin's a big drug-dealer back home. There's always been bad blood between our families. Suzanne just wanted to get out of Moosonee. Gus was the easiest way. You all right? - Yeah. - I'll make some calls. Find out, maybe, if somebody's heard something, or someone knows someone, maybe. (VOICE ECHOES) Someone knows someone else who knows something and, uh, you can stay for lunch. There's lots of good people here and good company. (VOICE FADES AWAY) Maybe you could just call me? COUNSELOR: Okay. (HAUNTING INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) (INDISTINCT CHATTER) Where do you get goose around here? Ah... There's more geese here than there is on James Bay. Lazy buggers, too. (CHUCKLES) Come. Your sister? Nah. She was a waitress. And she meets this guy, and she gets all these jobs. I got, uh... One of her, uh, modeling postcards. Yeah. A-ha. Here, you keep that. You met Gus? Oh, yes. He was always around. Big talker. Said he had, oh, lots of business. I think he was just spending her money. How come it took you so long to come down to look for her? Well, we thought someone would help. A band counselor told my mom to hire this useless lawyer down here. Yeah, she and my mom, they were gonna come down. As if. They've never even been south of Cochrane. You too, huh? (LAUGHS) Well, you came down anyways, my girl. She wasn't doing too good even with the money. She used to dream that she'd, uh, walk out into the lake till the water was way above her head. Then she'd come up for air and she was... She was... Back in Moose River. (POLICE SIREN WAILING) Oh, look the gosh-goddam, Johnny Law. Here comes your boyfriend. Wake up. (LAUGHS) OFFICER: Evening, Leo. Oh, we're just having dinner. You better go. Didn't we just talk about the whole fire thing? We were having, uh, goose, - but we got no oven. - Fire code, Leo. Do you want me to charge you? If I have to I will. - Do you want a goose? - OFFICER: Come on. - LEO: I'll give you the goose. - OFFICER: Put it out. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING) - (CAR HONKS) - MAN: Whoo! Kiss you all over. (GASPS) You're going the wrong way. Go that way. I need money. ANNIE: No, I'm just gonna check out a few things and then I'll be home, okay? Mom? So then tell me you won't worry. I'll call you in a few days, okay? I love you, Mom. Did you hear me? Yeah, okay. Okay, bye. RECEPTIONIST: You have Annie Bird here to see you. Yeah. Okay. He'll just be a moment. Annie? Um... Come on. Come on in. No calls. She started to get a reputation. Showing up late, not showing up at all. She turned up at one shoot with a black eye. I talked to her about moving out, getting some help, but she wouldn't leave him and she couldn't focus on her work. People stopped booking her, I had to let her go. Just so you know, I told all this to the police. But you didn't file the missing person's report? Me? No. I just figured she'd gone off with him. My mother's lawyer ever contact you? Mmm, no... Look, we don't have to get lawyers involved. The only money that I owe her was from the very last job. And we tried. We called a few times, but she wasn't picking up her messages. I... I... Just... I... I... I think that I... I'm not allowed to give it to you unless you have a death certificate or... - My sister's not dead. - I'm not saying that she is. Jesus! I'm saying that I don't think I can just... Why don't you just give me the number of the last person she worked for. Uh... Sure. Uh... He's a photographer. He kept booking her when nobody else would. And I gave all this to the cops, too. Your sister could have been massive. She had exactly the look people want right now. It's a damn shame. Thanks. Hold on, hold on, wait. Wait. (PHONE RINGING IN BACKGROUND) Your sister would come and collect her pay in person. She liked cash. I want to help you find her. - All right. - OFFICER: Hey, no guns inside... Yeah. Just shopping. Good night. (MELANCHOLY MUSIC PLAYING) (KIDS SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) (LAUGHING) Fucking drunk! (ENGINE REVVING) So what have we got here? So, still talking to the cops, huh? (SNIFFS) He said, "Hey," I said, "Hey." Marius warned you, man. What exactly do you guys want? We don't want no rats on our bridge. You used to play with my niece, Suzanne, you? Like eight or nine years old. Why isn't Annie back from Toronto? (SNIFFS) This here is my grandfather's gun. From the first war. Killed a lot of men, this gun. That's what it was made for. Go on home. I said get. Piece of shit. Maybe not. JOE: Okay, so now you're Clint fucking Eastwood. WILL: Life three crashes me. Came up better than my plane did. - Yup. - Can't kill me, motherfucker. - Uh-huh. - Remember, one. Atawapiskat, remember that one? Right between two trees. Right between two trees, took the wings right off. Still got my arms. Two. That minister over there in Mistissini - wanted me to carry that load of bibles in. - Yup. What the fuck are those things made of, man? - Iron wood? - Iron. I don't know. And three... Where the fuck... Can't kill me, motherfucker. Can't fucking kill you, huh? Hey, good for you. You think Marius gives a fuck? Oh, he'll give a fuck. Best hunter in James Bay, me. Yeah, yeah, yeah, we know. Hey, listen, bro, you gotta go to the cops. Yeah, right. You said already, he thinks you're a snitch. Because he's fucking mental. So he's mental. You're gonna wait for him to kill you? Fuck! Come on, bro, I'm telling you. - (CLATTERING) - This isn't my first fucking rodeo. - You gotta go to the cops. - Shut up. Fucking bullshit, "Shut up"? Who the hell do you think you are? Fucking, Billy Jack? Hey, bro, listen to me. I know what I'm talking about here. You gotta go to the cops. That's the only way it is. Do you hear what I'm saying? (GRUNTS) (BEAR GRUNTING) JOE: Hey, bro. What the fuck, bro? What the fuck happened? An old friend just stopped by for dinner. - Old friend? - Talk to you later. - What! - (DISCONNECTS CALL) (BIRD HOOTING) (WILL GRUNTING) (DOG HOWLING) (BEAR GRUNTING) (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Sister. Enjoy. (SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING) (CHUCKLES) (MEN TALKING ON TV) (GLASS CLATTERING) (ENGINE REVVING) WILL: I know it was him or one of his guys. GEORGE: But you didn't actually see anybody? - I saw a truck. - GEORGE: Marius'? It was too dark. Any damage inside? The window. Let's check it out. Lisette. Will, this, uh, the truck. Any chance you got a plate number? - No. - Mmm. How much you figure you had to drink this evening, buddy? (LAUGHS) Jesus, George. Marius Nutmaker just fire-bombed my house! Because? He thinks I'm snitching on him to you guys. Mmm. All right, I'm gonna write this up. Probably a good idea if you just spent the night with Lisette. He needs protection. GEORGE: It's not real practical. Just get him out of here for the evening, he should be fine. He needs protection! - He's not safe! - Stop it, please. God! Okay, I'm... I'm gonna go now. You watch yourself, Will. (LISETTE EXHALES) (LISETTE SOBS SOFTLY) WILL: Do you think you can sleep? Maybe try taking one of them pills the doctor gave you. I'm the snitch. What? What are you talking about? I'm the snitch. I told the cops about Marius. What'd you tell 'em? About his whole setup. How the hell would you know about Marius' setup? Suzanne knew. I found her journal. When did this happen? They called me. - Lis, when... - They called me... They called me back to the station a couple of days after they told us about the missing person's report. There was a bunch of them there. Who? Cops. I don't know. That shit, George, some guys I've never seen before. And they said that they could find Suzanne faster if they knew what Marius and Gus were doing. But the stuff that she wrote in there was too old. But there was names in there, and there was places where she would go with Gus to pick up stuff. (LISETTE SOBBING) I did it for my baby. She's a good girl. She's a good girl, Will. And everything that happened to her and went wrong with her is because of me. It's my fault. It's my fault! Oh, my God! (SOBS SOFTLY) LISETTE: Remember when they were small and nobody could tell them apart, except you and me? Shh. - I need my girls. - I know. Hey... Close your eyes now. (WILL HUMMING) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING) (FLIES BUZZING) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING) (INDISTINCT CHATTER) MAN: Please lock the door. Tell your sister I say hi. (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) (WHISPERS) Breathe in. Stop your heart. Let go. (GUNSHOT) (HORN BLARING IN DISTANCE) (HORN CONTINUES BLARING) CYNTHIA: Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention for just a few minutes? Welcome. Thank you so much for coming out this evening. Um, I just want to say a few words about these amazing images. As you can see, they're classical, timeless, totally of the moment, and, yes, they're universal. Woman as muse, woman as victim. Now these are pictures of an indigenous woman, with all her cultural specificity. She represents the faceless, the abused, missing, murdered. The subject's body now used to carry a message back to the dominant culture. A message which is even more powerful now that the model herself has gone missing. It's a haunting and angry, very brave statement by a first nation's artist. A man who has left behind a very lucrative world of fashion photography to do something which, in his words, finally matters. He has requested that the proceeds from the sales of this series be donated to the family fund for missing and murdered indigenous women and girls. (APPLAUSE) And the Seis McConnell Gallery will be donating our commissions as well. (APPLAUSE) I am so proud to be hosting his very first one-man show. Ladies and gentlemen, Jesse Butterfoot. (APPLAUSE) Thank you, Cynthia. Uh, the support, and the chance to actually show my work here, it means a lot. And there's not much else I can add that you haven't said already. Thank you. (APPLAUSE) - (INDISTINCT CHATTER) - (MUSIC PLAYING) BARTENDER: Don't worry about it. It's open bar. Annie. Hi. Hi. I'm glad you came. - I was worried that maybe it would be upsetting for you. - No. Hi. Uh, excuse me. Nate Berger from Now. Can I just steal you for five minutes? - Just give me a minute. - Okay. Hey, I found Geeta's number. That model that Suzanne was living with? - ANNIE: Great. - It was in my other contact list. Got you in here somewhere, so, uh... Thanks. Well, uh, gotta talk to this guy. Mix with the clients. You're here for a couple of days, right? Yeah, I think so. Well, why don't you come by the studio? We can talk some more. Sure. Glad you found me. Hey, sorry, sorry to interrupt. Uh, do you mind if I record you? I love, love, love the show and I want to get this filed before my deadline. Okay, just a couple of questions. (KNOCKING AT DOOR) (DANCE MUSIC PLAYING) Oh, my God. Hi. My God. I feel like I'm looking at Suzanne. Oh. Yeah. Sorry. I'm just not around enough to finish it. Last year, I was actually going to take down this entire wall, make it all one room. Then I got booked in Paris and I was just like, "Oh, whatever. "I'll do it whenever I'm supposed to do it." Do you want some, like, tea or something? ANNIE: Oh, yeah. That would be great. GEETA: You, um... - You went to the show? - Mmm-hmm It was so beautiful. I mean, like, so what if she couldn't book a fucking catalogue job. She was making art. She was really happy. Was Gus still around? No. God, no. She broke up with him when her agent dropped her. That's when I got her to move in here, and then she met Jesse, and she really got into what they were doing and she stopped, finally, obsessing over Gus. - Was Jesse paying her? - Yeah. Not like what she used to earn, but it was enough to make a living off of. She was just, like, really shit with money. (CHUCKLING) - Was she always like that? - Mmm-hmm. God. She smoked so much weed. And Gus wasn't around to supply her anymore. She owed me, like, three months rent. But it was fine, like, whatever, like, I was just happy to have someone living here, you know, 'cause I was just away so much. But it was just always about the money with her. And then Gus shows up. And he's, like, obviously, throwing it at her. Like, "Hey, baby, I'm gonna take care of you," and all that shit. He was so nasty that I didn't even want him in the fucking house. And then I went away for, like, two months on a shoot, and I came back, and she was gone. What the fuck? Like, I didn't even know, she didn't take anything with her. And, like, I called her phone so many times, her voicemail was full. I'm calling Jesse. And then the police show up and there is a missing person's report. I'm just so sorry. I just left it how it was. Oh. Take it. - Take all of it. - No. She might come back for it. You should take the room. - Really? - Yeah. Oh, yeah. I'd love it if you stayed. Okay. - Thank you. - Yeah. Size zero. Some of it can fit you. - As if. - (LAUGHS) She used to wear the same jeans for weeks. (SIGHS) (DOORBELL BUZZING) JESSE: Yeah? Uh, it's Annie. MAN: Uh, hey, Annie, come on up. It's, uh, third floor. ANNIE: Hi. Just a sec. I'm here to see Jesse. Hey, come on in. Are you good? Mmm-hmm. You want some tea? Sure. Still do that fashion stuff, huh? JESSE: A little, pays the bills. I saw this before at her agency. JESSE: I met her on that shoot. That's my moshum's hat. He gave it to her when we were little. She shouldn't have done that. JESSE: They went ape shit for that campaign in Milan. Designer said she looked Indian but not too Indian. They tend to be assholes. ANNIE: Syllabics? JESSE: That was her. From some book she remembered from grade school. Take Me Home. Yeah, we used to love that book. She can't write Cree. She can't even speak it. Well, that she remembered. It worked great for the image. Sorry, uh... It's so weird you guys look a lot alike. She said that, but... Actually seeing it... Why don't you put your bag down. Who's this? JESSE: My mum. Where is she from? Akwesasne. She was adopted when she was two. Married a white guy from Windsor. That was the first portrait that I shot. Uh, it could have been a lot better, but she never sat for me again. Did she die? JESSE: When I was 16. Tea. Feels like you still have stuff to ask me. You think Gus hurt her, like, really hurt her? I don't know. But she said that he was in town just to funnel meth back to his cousin. I guess. She never said. And then he started selling on his own. Gus was selling meth in Toronto? Meth, fentanyl, heroin. I think that's when he turned up again. And, uh, she just couldn't let it go. But I want you to know that your sister was the reason... Don't keep saying "was." Your sister is the reason I could do this show. She's my mother all over again. The show's about your mother? And Suzanne. It's about a woman who isn't where she's supposed to be. She can't get back there. Suzanne could get back if she had the money. She could just get on a plane. I should go. Oh. So what are you thinking? Uh, you gonna stick around for a bit? I don't know. Well, if you do, lemme know. Thanks. (DANCE MUSIC PLAYING IN BACKGROUND) It's too small. GEETA: Oh, my God, stop. You look fucking amazing. No, you can fit into half of her stuff. Let me just... Give me one sec. Here, hold still. Got it. Don't do that. Okay, I know. But I really want you to have a good time tonight and just relax. Thanks, but... Okay, I'll leave it here for you in case you change your mind and... Do not take off that dress, you look amazing. I can't wait for you to meet Victor and Violet. We're gonna go get some food, I hope you're hungry. Violet is gonna die when she sees you. She's gonna freak out. I think everyone's gonna freak out when they see you. Oh, and I... I talked to Jesse. He said he might stop by, so... That'll be interesting. (MUSIC CONTINUES PLAYING) (MOTOR WHIRRING) Hi. (INDISTINCT CONVERSATION) (MOTOR CONTINUES WHIRRING) - GEETA: Come on, babe. Hurry up. - Just a second. - There she is. - Finally. - You better be ready... - Come on, the drinks are not gonna drink themselves, girl. - You gotta pushover. - Come on. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) (DANCE MUSIC PLAYING) Hi! Oh, my gosh, you look so great. You'll never guess who I brought. Come here. I wanna introduce you to some of Suzanne's friends. MAN: Suzanne's sister! Annie! Hi Ladies. Guess who's here. - Annie Bird, Suzanne's sister. - My God! (INDISTINCT CHATTER) GEETA: This is Danny. He got Suzanne started with the agent. - Oh. - Hey, Annie! GEETA: They love you. How's it goin'? I guess you guys haven't heard anything new about Suzanne, huh? - GIRL: Have you talked to her? - Suzanne? No, no, no! No. WOMAN 1: it's like she came back from the dead! (LAUGHS) WOMAN 2: Okay, because I totally know what you're going through. I once had a cousin that killed himself. It was awful. - I totally get it. - Yeah. DANNY: So you just came down to feel things out for yourself? No, I came down here because my sister is a fucking pain in the ass. I've had to look after her my whole fucking life, and I want her to fucking answer for it. (CHUCKLES) (CHUCKLES) That's funny. So, um, how long are you in town for? - I don't know. - Do me a favor, if you need anything, anything at all, just get my number from Geeta, okay? Okay. And if you do hear anything about Suzanne... Annie? Promise me, you'll let me know? Yeah! No, I will definitely get in touch. Cool. Thank you! I'm just worried, you know. JESSE: Hey! It's now or never. GEETA: Oh, wow, look who decided to show up. Actually, I'm just leaving. She wanted to dance. What? - GEETA: Have fun. - Good to meet you, Annie. (DANCE MUSIC PLAYING) Are you okay? Yeah, yeah! You know humans are mostly made of water, that's why I live near a river. Yeah, I'll remember that. Um... Do me a favor. Stay away from that dickhead. I like his shirt. He's a dealer. Annie. He's one of Gus's connections. No, she said that's how Suzanne got her agent. How do you think she met him? Dealers and models, you know... Hey! Don't even go there. (DANCE MUSIC CONTINUES) (DANCE MUSIC CONTINUES) (MUSIC STOPS PLAYING) - JESSE: You're home safe and sound. - ANNIE: That's it? I just want ice cream. I do. I think you should go to bed, immediately. Okay... Fine. Just wondered what a fake Indian felt like. (LAUGHS) I think you're just gonna have to keep wondering. Hey, I'm sending you my address, it's right off Dundas. CAB DRIVER: No problem. (KEYPAD CLACKING) Did you get it? (MESSAGE BEEP) (KNOCKS ON WINDOW) I have no keys. All right, get in. Come on. It's hot, be careful. I'm fine now. You should drink it, it's good. It'll knock out whatever is left of that shit. - I don't do drugs. - It's a good thing, too. (SOFT MUSIC PLAYING) (CHUCKLES) Annie, what're you doing? If you're stoned, you don't wanna do this. Fuck you. Fine, I think it's time for you to go home. - Home? - To Moosonee. What do you know? The asshole of the Arctic. That's what Suzanne called it. - She hated it, you knew that. - No, I didn't know that. All she talked about was how much she missed it. She tried to hitchhike out when she was 13. Do you know how hard that is? You can't even do that, until it's winter. Or I'd catch her huffing, or with her legs around some guy. Or as she'd say, "Every fucking day in this place is exactly the same." - Is it? - It's whatever you make it. She made it shit. Everyone loves Suzanne. My mom, my uncle. Look at you. Your sister had her issues. Issues? She was trying, Annie. Yeah, she was messed up, but... She told me about your family. She did, eh? About the shit with your grandparents and residential schools. And how it screwed up your mom and your uncle. - You and her. - Me and her? (CRYING) The fuck do you know about me and her? - I just meant that you came out strong. - Aren't I lucky? I don't need you to feel sorry for me. It's not what I feel. It's not what I feel. I'm sorry about the fake Indian thing. No, you're not. (MUSIC CONTINUES) (MUSIC CONTINUES PLAYING) These moccasins, my mum made these. Uh, yeah! Um, you can have 'em. Ever weird, you. So I said, like, I'm gonna be your poster girl for diversity? You hire, like one South Asian model every five years. Definitely not. - No. - Really? Try another one. (SIGHS) They want like a fucking Nobel Peace Prize for it. I said to Karen, like, forget it. No, don't, don't. I said to Karen, forget it. She shouldn't hire any other models, she should totally tell those dickheads why. Hey, it's from your mom. Oh, my God, Annie, your mom got a postcard from Suzanne. Oh. - Huh! - GEETA: Well, where is she? Is she okay? She didn't say. That's so amazing. (INSECT BUZZES) (BIRDS CHIRPING) (INSECT BUZZES) (INSECTS BUZZING) Fuck off! God! (BIRDS SQUAWKING) (DISTORTED VOICE) (CLEARS THROAT) (BIRDS CAWING) (THUNDER RUMBLING) (RAIN PATTERING) (RAIN PATTERING) I might spend the winter and trap. - Any news from the mainland? No radio, me. - MAN: Me neither. This won't stop. I think you should stay the night. (RAIN PATTERING) (MAN CALLING BIRDS) (SHOTS FIRED) Make a good team us. It's my own fault. There's a woman up in your community. I went to see her a couple of times. One day I went, I was supposed to be fixing the electrical box in my house. I flew back that night, I could see my house on fire from the air. I knew they were all dead. So I just kept flying until I hit the water. The fire brigade couldn't save my family. They got me out of that river. And people from Moosonee raised enough money to fix my fucking plane. At the funeral home, I made the guy open up my wife's casket. Made myself look. So I'd have to remember. So, that's how I remember her. Hmm. They look just like my nieces. The little one looks just like Suzanne. Mmm-hmm. My wife... And you can't hide until you die. (SOBBING) JESSE: There's more about the connection to the land that Annie has here. You can see it in her eyes. The rust reminiscent of the sweet grass and the red sunset. This is something I've been working on. INTERVIEWER: Wow, that's really beautiful. So, Annie! Um, this is obviously in a very different direction than the Jesse was doing with your twin, uh... Do you see yourself as picking up where she left off? - Or are you telling another side of indigenous women's story? - Um... I'm not really telling anything. Okay, I don't mean to put words in your mouth, but... - It is the other side of indigenous women. - Okay. Yeah. The other show was about victimization. This show is about resilience. Annie is a hunter and I think that comes through. Okay! Well, thank you very much. I'll look forward to seeing that. Thank you for taking this time. Congratulations. Thank you very much, Annie. - And, uh... - Thank you, sir. And I want to talk to you about a possible feature. JESSE: Okay. - You did really good, okay? - Don't make me do that again. It's what they want. - I mean it. - Okay. I gotta go talk to him, okay? - My place, 6:30. - I know. - We have to leave the apartment. Restaurant by 8:45. - I know. ASSISTANT: I was just saying to Cynthia, I've been trying to get the magazine for, like, years now to do this feature on indigenous artists, young indigenous artists... CYNTHIA: Bye, Annie. ASSISTANT: I wanna do a group shot. I've been trying to get a... I can't do that stuff. So, then, don't do that stuff, he can do his own publicity. Like, he's so bad at it. Anyways, listen to me. I just booked a job. It's for three weeks in the Cayman Islands. I think it's from the 21st to the 5th. Are you gonna be around? Yeah. I mean, you can stay with Jesse, that's fine, but if you're in the house... Just so it looks like someone's living there. - Hey, guys! - Hi. - Oh, you guys look so beautiful. - Hi. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) Let's get a table, I'm starving. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) (CHUCKLES) DANNY: Annie, I didn't know you were still in town. Yeah, um, I texted you, and told you, so... And, uh, no new news from Suzanne, huh? GEETA: No. Oh, my God, no. But her mom got a postcard. Are you serious? - GEETA: Yeah, isn't that crazy? - GIRL: Oh, my God. Jesus. Wow. What a relief. When was that? Uh, like a few weeks ago. - Yeah. - Did she say where she is? She just... She didn't say much. Of course. Still, that's great news. - Yeah, you gotta go. - I have a dinner. So... - We just got here. - I know! Sorry, bye. - Can you grab some coffee? - Yup. He wants to buy two of the vertical ones for his boardroom. - ANNIE: Wow! - Guy's major. Cynthia thinks it's a done deal. - So we'll see. - ANNIE: What's the passcode? - What? - The passcode? The restaurant wants a reservation. JESSE: Oh, jeez, 4051. (SOFT MUSIC PLAYING) (MUSIC CONTINUES PLAYING) (MUSIC CONTINUES PLAYING) JESSE: Do you think we should get an Uber? Just so we don't have to worry about parking. What's wrong? I saw what you did. (MUSIC CONTINUES PLAYING) Say something. I didn't think it would change anything if I told you. And then I didn't know... Know how. (CLEARS THROAT) Wasn't sure. To tell me what? That she was using, or that you were taking a picture and painting out what you couldn't sell. She told me to do that, okay? She didn't want people to see her like that. I took her to the hospital, more times than I can tell you. I checked her into rehab. I even tried to take her out of the country with me, just to get away from Gus. And the shit he was feeding her. She just wanted me to keep her working. Even when she couldn't. And when she went missing, I looked for her. I tried to find Gus. I went to places you never wanna see. I went to the police. I didn't know what else to do. You reported her missing, but you didn't give your name. You selfish fucking coward. What about us? What about my family? The whole time, you never thought, "Oh, maybe I should call her family!" That didn't occur to you? She said it would kill your mother. What about me? Why didn't you call me? She said that you hated her guts. What was I supposed to do? Annie! (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) (LAUGHING MANIACALLY) (SIREN WAILING) (DRAMATIC MUSIC CONTINUES) GEETA: Annie! Is that you? Danny brought some wine. Hey, what's goin' on? Whoa. Where are you going? - I gotta go home. - What? Why? Why? - Danny! - I just gotta go. She's going home. Why? What happened? Is Suzanne back in Moosonee? Why don't you ask your friend Gus? Gus is out of the picture. - My God, what the fuck? - Stay the fuck down. Here's the thing. Gus and your junkie sister stole a shitload of dope from me. Now since Gus has been taken out of the equation, it means that your sister is sitting on a lot of my dope, or a lot of my cash, or both. So, let's try it again. - Danny, fucking stop it. - Shut your fucking mouth. (INDISTINCT YELLING) Shut your fucking face. - Stop it! Stop it! - Motherfucker. Okay, listen to me. Here we go. - Here we go. - (GASPING FOR BREATH) Just tell me where she is. I don't know. - Annie? - I don't know. (GASPING FOR BREATH) I don't know. Tell me where she is. Where's Suzanne? She's dead. (ANNIE GASPS FOR BREATH) DANNY: You better fucking hope I don't find her first. (COUGHS) (DOOR OPENS) (DOOR CLOSES) Annie! Are you okay? I'm so sorry. I've never seen him like that. I swear to God, please, Annie. I'm sorry. Are you okay? Please don't call the police. Stop crying. I'm so sorry. Please don't call the police, Annie. Danny is really dangerous. He's gonna come after me. LISETTE: (OVER PHONE) She sent me a postcard, from Toronto. She said she's coming home soon. (SOBBING) I told Annie. I told her to come back. But she wants to keep looking. Well... Good news, Lis. Yup. LISETTE: You okay? Hey, listen. I, uh... I just got in. I'll call you back later, okay? Okay. Call me. Okay? (SOBS) Okay. (PHONE BEEPS) (SOBBING) (CONTINUES SOBBING) LISETTE: I'm not saying it's forever. I'm just saying it's going to be a long winter. You'd be better off here with me and the girls. I know you've been away, but that house is a mess and it's full of mouse (Native word) Is there something wrong, Lisette? It's Marius. He got shot in the head. The police came around. I said that you were off hunting. I said that you left before he got shot. George is coming over. He wants to talk to you. Okay. He's not dead. Guess he got lucky, heh? Not so lucky. Brain damage. Anyway, we, uh, pretty much written it off as a biker hit. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. Marius has ran with some real trash. Probably just pissed the wrong guy off. So, where is he? He just got out of rehab last month. Anyway, good talking to you. No problem. You and I both know, your flying license expired 20 years ago. There's a whole lot of charges I can throw your way right now, but I'm only gonna ask one thing, all right? Next time, shoot straighter. (CAR ENGINE STARTS) JOE: Christ, you might as well give up. They got that whatchamacallit, that Marlin 336. They're on sale at the Northern Store. You should check it out. I don't like Marlins. Hey, want some tea? Lisette's bringing cake. Oh, shit. More cake? What, she gettin' a head start on her... On her whatchamacallit there, Christmas baking? She hasn't baked in six months. She only bakes when she's happy. So you eat whatever she walks in here, okay? Oh, I like cake, me. I love cake. Well, I live off the cake, eh. You okay? DANNY: So... So, since you have your arm around the sister, I guess you must be Will. - Yeah. - Good. So here's the thing, Will. I'm looking for your niece Suzanne and I'm hoping you can help me out. I don't know where Suzanne is. Hmm. (CHUCKLES) Hey, Mom. I got her that job. You play? - No. - Then how come you got the clubs? Some guy brought 'em up from Toronto on a hunting trip. Didn't know where he was coming to, I guess. (CHUCKLES) (CHUCKLES) Don't I know the feeling. They're not bad, you know. Maybe you should learn. I don't know where Suzanne is. Well, here's what I think. I think she came back to Moosonee. Jesus Christ. She hasn't been here for years. He knows that. (CHUCKLES) Are we interrupting a party? Were you gonna make tea? Yeah. Well, is there enough in here for everybody? - Jesus. - (SCREAMS) I told you we don't know where Suzanne is. Get up. What are we doing here, Will? Do we really just... keep going? This has nothing to do with her, Marius. If you wanna shoot me, go ahead. - The shit between you and me, is between you and... - DANNY: No. Will, it's between you and me. If you just tell me where your niece is, then I'm done here. You understand that, right? That's it. I don't know. Okay. Okay. This fucking family. Get him out. Get him the fuck out. Get him, Marius, get him the fuck out and that fuckhead, too. This fucking girl. This fuckin' family. Get your fuckin' ass down. Get the fuck out. MARIUS: Where is she? I'm gonna shoot you in the head, bro. You tell me where Suzanne is, and I'll only shoot out one of your eyes. DANNY: Stop fucking around, Marius. Maybe you would like it if I went back inside and finished her off, first, Will. Is that what you'd like? Five seconds. One. Two. Three. Four. Okay. We're done here. (GUNSHOT) (GUNSHOT) (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) (INAUDIBLE CONVERSATION) - ANNIE: Sergeant Cusano? - GUSANO: Speaking. - Hey, it's Annie Bird. - Hi, Annie. I was calling about that tip you mentioned last time. About the body you found off the ravine on Bay View. No, it didn't match your sister's description. ANNIE: Oh, okay. You were right about those stupid traps, you. Full. Pelts are drying in the shed. Gotta deal with those jerks at the store. Get you a good price. NURSE: Keep talking to him. We don't know what he hears. (CUSANO OVER PHONE) I promise you Annie, I will call if I get anything. Like even if someone thinks they see her. Toronto. Huh. Ever weird, that place. I got some stories. So, I'll check in next week, then. (MACHINES BEEPING) And I'm still trying. You need to know that. I'm not letting her go, okay? (VENTILATOR BREATHING) (INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING) (MACHINE BEEPS) (CHILDREN LAUGHING) (MUSIC CONTINUES) Anne, you came back. It's Annie, Uncle. Tell him again. It's Annie. I know. You're gonna be all right. (MUSIC CONTINUES) (MUSIC FADES OFF)
