I have no time for that. Playing hard to get! One, two, three... Hide your face, Look again. Grab the sleeve, -Hello! - Good afternoon. Excuse me. In general, it's ok, Try it yourself next time, I'm sweating so much. I ran into a nasty guy just now. He's from Ishino-gumi management, his name is Araki. He seemed to be interested in me, but such guys are not to be fooled around with, Sometimes, I don't understand you at all. You're being distant and always seem to be thinking of something else, But you're definitely not a cold man. That's why you're attractive, Teacher, when the festival is over, let's visit some quiet place together. I also want to pamper myself from time to time. It's boring to serve middle-aged men, isn't it? So? Do you agree? Well, let’s begin. Is that it? How could I fail to notice that you're Asakura's lover? Well, can I take you under my wing? You're speaking of such things out of the blue. What you get from that old Asakura per month isn't enough, is it? I will make you rich, Sure, the best sponsor is the one who pays the most. But as of now, I'm faithful to my sponsor. Don't get clever with me, Sponsor, you say? I have my moral principles. But still, the more the better, Then, your relationship will soon be over. If you have some debts, I'll pay them off right away. Mr. Director, what's on your mind? You're not fooling with me, are you? Excuse me. A phone call for you. Ask them what they want. They say it's personal. Who is it? They say you'll know when you answer. Hello? It's Endo. I beg your pardon., Yes, I understand. I'll be there soon. A STORMIN POLITICAL AND ECONOMICAL CIRCLES IS COMING! WILL THE SECRET RECORDS OF THE BUSINESS TYCOON ASAKURA BE REVEALED TO PUBLIC? I can't be... It's bad that my name came up. But chairman, you name isn't mentioned here, so... Anyway, it seems they have learnt about... the land issues of East Japan Highway Corporation. If the half-assed officials get their hands on his records, the names of several important people involved will come up. You refused to sweep the tax evasion case of 150 billion under the rug. Is that why he's mad at us? It's better to get rid of him, I deliberately turned him down. They say that after this exposure he won't get back on his feet again. Who can come up with 5 billion bail for him? He's got a few secret allies, Asakura won't give up either, what can he do? I only know that Asakura is a hindrance for me. Here's 40 million yen. No matter what, I've got nothing to do with it. I understand, chairman. You kindly came to me, I will do everything l can. Since you accepted the job, you will finish it. Yes, I understand. I won't cause you any trouble, The executor will be one of your men? Yes, but it's important to think it over and select the one who will do it perfectly. Please, leave it to me. Alright, Thirty million yen. It won't be easy but we'll only get one shot at this, I understand. If he agrees, give him ten million yen, When he's done, we'll give him ten more. Twenty million in total. It's a difficult job, Count on me. I'll bet my life on it. Even if we fail, I won't ever implicate you... Frankly, I know a man suitable for this job Who is he? He's on good terms with my pal, Kusanaga. He's a master, An outsider. Is that okay? Don't worry. I'll bring him. If you're sure, go for it. Anyway, I give you 20 million yen, You can hire him for 15 million or make do with just 10. That depends on you. All l ask in return is... I understand. It will be done. I'm Kusanagi's acquaintance, Araki from Ishino-gumi. I'd like to ask you for a favour. What favour? I want you to make a person disappear. Will you hear me out? I'm not a magician, who can make someone disappear. Fujigawa Juichiro from Fujigawa school. This name is for the outside world. But in our community they say you're a skilled assassin, Watch your mouth, This is Ishino-gumi’s request. If you don't accept this job, I won't be able to face the chairman. It's true, so please. In any case, at least hear me out, The target hasn't paid more than 100 billion in taxes. The name's Asakura. The newspapers wrote about him, Meanwhile, others hang themselves due to unbearable taxes. He's a nasty guy. Decent citizens tighten their belts and fully pay the enormous taxes, don't they? I don't think we can let this scoundrel get away with it. Nitta-san, please say yes. How much will you pay? The payment is 15 million yen. Fifteen million. Please. How long will the preparation for this take? Five more days... Make it three. But three days are not... If you can't, leave, If I had money I could've hired any number of lawyers, I won't forgive this bunch for abandoning and trying to strangle me! Just you see, I'll put them behind bars, They still owe me for the suffering I had to bear alone, I understand your feelings. Besides, I know their next move, A killer will show up before I expose them, What? We must hire bodyguards... Here they are, the bodyguards. They are investigators, They got me out on bail to put these records in order. The prosecutor put them on me so that I can’t destroy the evidence or flee the country. Haha, bodyguards from public money. I'm safe now, aren’t I? We must immediately seize the files relating to the records. He's in room 702. He's very cautious, always surrounded by cops. It's very difficult to get him. l leave it to you. He's a real pro. I'm very grateful, So, when are you going to act? I'll decide that myself. Please. If you're taking the job then I'm at ease. As promised, here's your 10 million yen in advance, When you're done... Then five more. Are you okay with that? When I'm done, I want 10 million. I understand. When you finish the job, I'll give you 10 million yen. I'll be in touch. Wait here. Can you manage in half an hour? I'm sorry, but I can only wait till 7:10, If the police sees me there, we're finished. Thanks. Teacher. This is an unusual place for us to meet, You're not what you seem. Have you come with your girlfriend? This old man invited me here. You should at least know his name, Asakura, the loan shark. Hey, gather around, let's begin! What's the matter? Let's swim! Dad! Araki! Excellent work. It was done by a dance teacher named Nitta. Yes, What? Yes, dance teacher! Exactly... Weird guy. No, no. I'm glad to be of use. He's a useful man but we have get rid of him after the job's done. Here, take it. ASAKURA EARLIER RELEASED ON BAIL KILLED IN THE HOTEL POOL! CAR CRASHED AND BURNED IN SUKUMO VALLEY, THE DRIVER VANISHED Hello. Who's that? Yes, he is here. - It's for you. -ls it? Who's that? What's the matter at this hour? Huh? Have you read today’s paper? Has the job really been done? They say the body hasn't been found. Are you sure Nitta is dead? Definitely, the canyon is deep. Then, why is there no body? It's okay. It might've got stuck in a tree or... Idiot! Find Nitta's house and check it out. Teacher, what's the matter? It's so dark... You must've rested well last night. You disappeared so suddenly... You know Asakura’s been killed, right? There's so much ruckus over it, I was questioned. They asked about our relationship, how much did he pay. Because I'm a young geisha. I said the old man was juiced up every night. All his wealth comes from other people’s suffering So it's no surprise he was killed. But it's a great loss for me, I need to find a new sponsor, ASAP I have a request. For me? What is it? Call for Araki from Ishino-gumi. Araki... Well, I thought it was something about sponsorship. What business do you have with that yakuza? There's alot I don't know about you, teacher. Will you call him? I wanted to force you to go somewhere with me and escape from everybody for a couple of days. I don't want to be interrogated again. Teacher? I'll thank you, properly. Thanks for that. By the way, I'd love for you to be my sponsor, even if it’s only temporarily. The reward is great. Fine, I'll make the call. What? You say you don't know? Yes, Kusanagi who introduced me to Nitta, has gone to Sikoku so I can't find Nitta's house until he returns. So, he went back to his homeland. Police hasn't found the body yet. Moreover, they've begun to investigate Asakura's murder, It's alright. The car rolled down the canyon, so he's definitely dead. You can hever be too careful. If he has survived, we'll be his next targets. Hello. Yes, it's me, What? What are you saying? There's a nasty guy who's been mocking me recently. I think you could have a nice chat with him. So, I definitely want to meet you. Okay? Sorry, I'm late, Let me go! The cat, it was your doing, right? What are you talking about? I don’t know anything! I'll talk! I'll talk so let me go! Call Ishino. You will do as I say. It's you? What? The head of Osugi-gumi has arrived? Yes, they say you should talk about the shop that recently opened near the station, Huh? Yes, they want you to come to the office. Yes, Got it. Keep him there, I'll be there soon. I finished Asakura as I promised. And came for the rest of my money, It was 10 million yen, I think. Twenty, What? You owe me 10 million plus 10 more for the car accident. We are not marketing here, Do you write checks for murders? Open it. There's not enough money, I know you're hiding the coffers of the gang. Twenty million, We're done here, Now leave. That's not all. Who ordered the hit on Asakura? What are you talking about? I ordered the hit. You're not clever enough to go beyond blackmail or intimidation. Someone else who wanted Asakura dead. -Who's he? -I'm sick of you! I hated him. For what? Nobody... Nobody asked me! Okay, do as you please, However, this guy told me everything. That's a lie! I said nothing! He milked easy. Damn! Then, I'll tell you. Mr. Karasaki asked me. -Karasaki? -Yes, Have you heard his name? Behind the scenes man in the political circle, Karasaki Tayi. I have no idea why he wanted to eliminate Asakura. I simply complied with his request. If you think I'm lying you can visit his country house, Well, take me there, Your plan never changes, does it? Bastard! You thought you could escape with nothing but money? It seems that Nitta is still alive. He killed Ishino and Araki, that's for sure. Don't panic, he's just a hit man. He might start hunting me, How can he know about you? Calm down. You're surprisingly gutless, If Ishino talked before he died, I will definitely... Even so, you will get rid of him yourself. Or do you feel stronger only in Ishino-gumi? Anyway, I have absolutely nothing to do with this, ATSUO NIWA, SEIKEI JOURNAL {POLITICO-ECONOMIC JOURNAL)} I heard that you were legal advisor and took part in the creation of Asakura's records. Take a seat. Asakura's records are very important for unmasking the culprits in the political circle. I'd like to publish at least part of them, I think it will also be the execution of Mr. Asakura's will. You know what Mr. Asakura wanted to reveal, don't you? Even if these Asakura's records existed, they were his personal business, We are lawyers and we absolutely cannot divulge privileged information. Well, can you at least name the people pointed out by Mr. Asakura? You're so young. Doesn't your publishing house have its own channels? If you want to know, dig it yourself. ENDO CONSTRUCTION ENDO TRADING ENDOENTERPRISES Yes, co-ordinate it. Mr. Endo, please be careful. A strange columnist is trying to sniff something out. No need to worry, I burned those records right after I bought them, Though it was an expensive purchase, So, nobody will find anything unless they start questioning you. I won't say a word, no matter what. I won't make the same mistake as Asakura. Oh, Mr. Kikuno! Discussing some profitable business again? Nothing gets by you. I'd better go. Send my regards to the chairman., Sorry for begging for dance festival tickets. What? That's the reward for introducing Kikuno. So, why are you here? I thought you could treat me tonight if you are free, Don't you have a rehearsal? My teacher has gone missing recently. So, I don’t need any rehearsals. Is it okay that you don't practice? I've learnt the dance so there's nothing to worry about. What's your teacher’s name? Fujigawa Juichiro. What about his real name? I guess it was Nitta. Nitta? I will treat you, but you have an opportunity to earn some money. Well? If you help me, I'll take care of you. I'll buy you a flat and a car, Nice offer. I was just looking for a sponsor. So, how can I help you? Just take me to that Nitta guy. And don't ask any questions, Same as I did with Mr. Kikuno? No, you don’t have to introduce me. I'm in a hurry, Let me know when you see him, Okay? Just tell me your location, Got it? I always listen to you, Mr. Director. Where've you been all this time? Teacher: I understand you less and less, This is for calling Araki. I had it difficult after my sponsor’s sudden death, You're always welcome, That man died. I was shocked when I read the newspaper. It's a big sum of money for a simple call. Teacher, you're making good income, Has Asakura ever mentioned a man named Endo? Endo... which Endo? Endo Yasujire, Construction company CEO, That Endo! I owe him for festival tickets. But Asakura never mentioned him. We've known each other for along time, Can you take me to Endo? It's simple, He will definitely show up at the festival. Is Endo here? His seat is in the middle of the second row but he hasn't arrived. Well, do you like it? Yes, very much, I've always dreamed of this life, That's great. Call Nitta here. Your teacher, I haven't seen him. He said he was going to Kanazawa. But you can communicate, right? Dad... No use trying to fool me, I don't know what you're thinking, but that man is a famous hit man. You understand now? He killed Asakura. I have business with him. Got it? You will call him here. What's the matter? If all goes well, you'll be rewarded. If you don't, then I will... Alright, I will. - Mizuwari, - Okay. Thanks to Endo, I live in a luxury apartment now, He is a suitable sponsor so I won't bother you, When is he coming? Tomorrow evening. Seems he will have a meeting with four or five men. Is that Endo? Sorry, I was on the terrace, Has Nitta called? Nope. Haven't you talked tonight? Sure, Strange. He should've at least called you back. Maybe he noticed that he was being followed. I don't think so. He will surely come, And when he comes he will fall right into my trap. You've told him the truth, haven't you? I wouldn't dare. But you and Nitta... I have strictly business relations with Nitta. I do everything for the money, I came to dad because it's more profitable to be with you. One can't betray his benefactor, can he? I have to kill him before he starts hunting me. No matter how skillful he is, he's just one man, Before he starts hunting. He's just got one more enemy. That was the meaning of the recent greeting. What are you talking about? Was it you who ordered Asakura's murder? Yes... that's right! The reason he had to be dealt with were his records, right? Stop! Enough! I'll pay! Ten million! Ten million! Bring the phone! It's me. I need 10 million in cash. Ten. Yes, Bring it to a certain apartment. Yes, Room 405, What more do you want? You throw money around too easily. Did you think you could pay me off? Who ordered Asakura's assassination? If you don't talk, I'll help you. Stop! Undress. Send them back. I came upon the director’s request. I know. Give it to me. No, I will give it to him personally. He's here, right? I'll take it. Daddy is taking a bath. He can't enter, can he? Got it? Give it to Hideko and return. Alright, it's ok, Please, Nice talking. How about keeping it up? What shall I do with this? Nobody knows. Nobody but me... Yes, it's Endo. He's in the bathroom... What? Sensei is leaving Japan? Yes, So what? Yes. Waiting room 3A. Who's that, sensei? Hello? Who was that? Kikuno. He said that a certain man is flying to Europe today at 11:30. Who's that, sensei? Did he say his name? He said Endo knows who heis. Waiting room 3A then, Hello, airport? I'm from Seikei magazine, please tell me who's flying to Europe today at 11:30 and giving an interview in room 3A? Yes, yes. Yes, Hojo Tadahisa? No, thank you. Hojo Tadahisa... Do you know him? Only his name, Right... when Endo was buying the records from Kikuno, there was another man present, I think they called him Hojo. That's right. That man was so important that Endo was lowering his eyes, Take it. Wait! Where're you going? Will you take me with you? Don't you understand how I feel? Well, Go then. I will report it to the police, I know that you killed Asakura. You're a hit man. It was me who remembered Hojo, I got... involved in this of my own free will. Please, take me with you. I don't need a woman who stays with anybody who pays. You used me! What is the purpose of your journey? It’s just a vacation, Some people think the purpose is to avoid the publication of Asakura's records. Asakura? I have nothing to do with this man. I want to peacefully enjoy the trip to Europe. I want to meet my old friends too. We have to end this interview since we have no time left, Please. Let's celebrate the journey abroad and pray for sensei'’s health with three banzais. Long live sensei Hojo! Banzai! Banzai! Banzai! Banzai! Banzai! Banzai! Sensei! Sensei! Chairman! Chairman! Where're you going? Sorry. I dropped something here, This room is off-limits during the examination, It's important, I'm from Kyoei information agency. Please. We've got information about an explosives device in the luggage room. What, again? This is ridiculous!
