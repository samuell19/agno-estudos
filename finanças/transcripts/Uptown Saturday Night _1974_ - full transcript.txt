ONE DAY, I'M ON TOP OF THE WORLD. AND NOW THIS THING WITH SILKY SLIM. HE MUST BE CRAZY! THINK I'M GONNA LET HIM MOVE IN ON MY TERRITORY, AND I'M NOT GONNA DO NOTHIN' ABOUT IT? WHO DOES HE THINK HE IS? HE'S MESSING WITH GEECHIE DAN BEAUFORD! I WILL KILL THE PUNK! TRYING TO OFF ME. I WILL MURDER THE SUCKER! Slim: OK, GEECHIE, THAT WAS YOUR SHORTS. NEXT TIME IT'S GOING TO BE YOUR LIFE. YOU GOT A LIFE, TOO, SILKY SLIM. I'M GIVING YOU TWO MINUTES. WE MAKE A DEAL NOW OR YOU'RE GOING TO BE WEARING WINGS. TAKE YOUR BEST SHOT! NO DEAL! AW, COME ON, MAN. LET'S BE REASONABLE. AIN'T NOTHING TO BE REASONABLE ABOUT. LOOK, GEECHIE, I SAID LET'S TALK, MY MAN. YOU TEAM UP WITH ME, AND WE RULE THIS TOWN FROM RIVER TO RIVER. NEVER WILL SO FEW OWE SO MUCH TO SO MANY. THAT'S THE ONE! HE-- HE-- HE'S THE ONE WE'RE AFTER. SHUT UP OVER THERE! BUT HE'S THE ONE WHO ROBBED MADAME ZENOBIA'S. SO WHAT? BUT HE STOLE SOMETHING THAT NIGHT SOMETHING HE DON'T KNOW ABOUT, SOMETHING THAT'S WORTH A LOT OF MONEY. I TOLD YOU, SHUT UP. DON'T BUG ME WITH THIS PENNY ANTE CRAP AT A TIME LIKE THIS. YOU GOT ONE MINUTE, GEECHIE. BUT THIS AIN'T NO PENNY ANTE, MR. GEECHIE DAN. IT'S WORTH A FORTUNE. MR. GEECHIE DAN, IT'S WORTH A FORTUNE. WE'LL SHARE IT WITH YOU, MR. GEECHIE DAN. YOU KNOW HOW MUCH IT'S WORTH? $300,000. WHAT'D YOU SAY? $300,000 IN DIAMONDS. SLIM? $300,000...IN DIAMONDS? YEAH, BUT HE DON'T KNOW NOTHIN' ABOUT IT, SEE? HOW YOU KNOW THEY KNOCKED OFF ZENOBIA'S? GO ON, TALK FAST, TURKEY! OR I'LL PUT A HOLE THROUGH YOUR EYES! 'CAUSE THAT'S WHAT HE SAID WHEN HE ROBBED THE PLACE. HE SAID, "NEVER HAVE SO FEW OWED SO MUCH TO SO MANY." AND-- AND HE HAD A MASK ON AT THE TIME, BUT WE RECOGNIZE HIS VOICE. YEAH. HE'S THE ONE. WHAT ABOUT THE DIAMONDS? YOUR TIME'S UP, GEECHIE. GIVE ME A COUPLE OF MINUTES, SLIM. I'M TALKING IT OVER WITH MY BOYS. ONE MINUTE, MY MAN. GO ON. GO ON. TALK, TALK. ME AND MY MAN, WE WAS GOING TO MADAME ZENOBIA'S. AND WE WAS BEHIND THESE TWO AFRICAN GENTLEMEN WHO WAS GOING IN THERE. FIRST, SEE, THE DOORMAN, HE WOULDN'T LET THEM IN. THEN, THEY SHOWED HIM A LETTER FROM THEIR LAWYER THAT SAID THEY WERE VERY IMPORTANT PEOPLE IN THE DIAMOND BUSINESS. SO, THE DOORMAN, HE APOLOGIZED TO THEM, AND HE LET THEM IN. SO, LATER ON THAT EVENING, I WAS IN THE JOHN. I WAS RELIEVING MYSELF. AND THE TWO AFRICANS CAME INTO THE BATHROOM. THEY DIDN'T KNOW I WAS IN THERE BECAUSE I WAS SITTING ON THE JOHN. AND ONE OF THEM, I HEARD HIM SAY, "WHAT DID YOU DO WITH THE DIAMONDS?" SO, THE OTHER ONE SAID, "THEY IN MY LAWYER'S OFFICE. "THEY'LL BE SAFE THERE FOR THE NEXT 10 DAYS "TILL WE GET BACK FROM WASHINGTON. THEN, THE BUYER WILL COME IN FROM CALIFORNIA." THE OTHER AFRICAN SAID, "HOW MUCH YOU THINK WE GOING TO GET FOR THESE STONES?" SO, THE OTHER ONE SAID, "$300,000." SO THEY LEFT, AND I CAME RUNNING OUT TO TALK TO MY MAN ABOUT GETTING TO THE LAWYER'S OFFICE TO HIT THE PLACE AND GET THEM DIAMONDS. THAT'S WHEN SILKY SLIM COME IN AND HELD EVERYBODY UP AND TOOK THE WALLETS AND THE MONEY, AND ALONG WITH IT, THE LAWYER'S LETTER WITH THE ADDRESS OF WHERE THE DIAMONDS IS. UH-HUH. SO THAT'S WHY YOU'VE BEEN SNIFFING AROUND-- TO HELP YOU FIND THE LETTER. YES, SIR. OF COURSE, IF YOU'RE LYING, THE UNDERTAKER GOING TO VISIT YOUR RELATIVES. OK, GEECHIE, LET ME HEAR IT. ALL RIGHT! WE CAN MAKE SOME KIND OF DEAL. COME ON IN. GOOD. EVERYBODY KEEP THEIR HANDS WHERE WE CAN SEE THEM. OK. MAKE SURE YOU COME THROUGH THAT DOOR THE SAME WAY. NAH, PUT THEM AWAY. MY MAN. WHAT'S HAPPENIN'? DOWN TO BUSINESS, SLIM. I DON'T LIKE YOUR BAG. YOU GOT NO CLASS. DRUG DEALING, PROSTITUTION, VULGAR STICKUPS LIKE MADAME ZENOBIA'S LAST SATURDAY NIGHT. THAT AIN'T MY THING. I WAS HOME IN BED LAST SATURDAY NIGHT. NO SKIN OFF ME, MAN, SO LET'S MOVE ON. NOW, I GOT SOMETHING WE CANWORK ON TOGETHER. IT'S A $300,000 PROPOSITION. I'M INTERESTED. 50/50. AND IF WE WRAP IT UP, THEN WE CAN TALK MAYBE ABOUT SOME TOGETHERNESS ON A PERMANENT BASIS. WHAT'S THE DEAL? YOU LEFT ZENOBIA'S THE OTHER NIGHT LOADED DOWN WITH PERSONAL EFFECTS, AMONG WHICH IS A DOCUMENT THAT WILL LEAD US TO THE $300,000. NOW, IT'S A SIMPLE DOCUMENT. IT AIN'T GOT NO MEANING UNTIL I TELL YOU WHAT IT CONNECTS UP WITH, AND I AIN'T GOING TO TELL YOU UNTIL YOU BRING BACK EVERY BIT OF THE PERSONAL PROPERTY YOU LIFTED. [CHUCKLES] YOU WON'T FIGURE IT OUT IN A MILLION YEARS, SLIM. HOW DO I KNOW YOU AIN'T RUNNING A GAME? MY WORD IS MY REP! BUT, OF COURSE, IF YOU DIDN'T HIT MADAME ZENOBIA'S LAST SATURDAY NIGHT, THEN THE WHOLE THING IS ACADEMIC. YOU GOT A DEAL. GOOD. YEAH. NOW...WE'LL MEET IN A NEUTRAL PLACE. I'LL LET YOU KNOW WHERE WHEN I CALL YOU AND TELL YOU WHAT TIME. I'LL BE THERE WITH THREE OF MY BOYS, AND YOU SHOW UP WITH THREE OF YOURS. LOOK TO SEE YOU AROUND. YOU WILL. AND, UH... ORDER ME A NEW CAR. THAT IS, IF YOU WANT TO BE COMFORTABLE RIDING AROUND IN YOUR OWN.
