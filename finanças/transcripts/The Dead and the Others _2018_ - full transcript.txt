Father! Where are you? Ihj?c! Can you see me? No. But I can hear you. I dreamed that you were here, so I came. Father? Are you here, Father? You are forgetting my funerary feast. I've been walking alone for some time in here. At night, in the cold. Make my funerary feast quickly, so I can leave for my village. Son, get in the water. I'll catch a fish for you. I don't want to. Father? THE DEAD AND THE OTHERS - K?t?! - What? - Where is your husband? - I don't know! Tell him to cut the straw fast and bring it to cover our house. While you stay there, he keeps stringing you along. The rainy season is coming and he didn't fix the roof yet. Ok, I've already talked to him. We?ll pick up the straw. We must renew this roof quickly, I don't want anyone complaining when the rain comes. Come to suckle, Tepto. Look, Tepto. Take it! Take the knife, Tepto. I'm tired of carrying him on the lap. Tepto is heavy, right? I'm thirsty. Me too. I forgot the water. I didn't remember. Ihj?c, let's sleep here, in the swidden. Let's go back to the village. I don't want to stay here. But Tepto is already sleeping. Better stay here tonight. We leave tomorrow morning. Where did you go the other night? Nowhere. I woke up because Tepto was crying and you weren't there. I... I woke up to pee. Then I saw a trail of anteater and followed it, trying to hunt. I heard a noise and waited, but the animal didn't appear. Only then I went back home. Is it true? Aren't you lying? I woke up during the night with Tepto crying. Ihj?c wasn't there. Maybe he's dating someone. Could be. Yesterday, I waited for my boyfriend but he didn't show up. So I thought: ''Let him date another one then''. What about you, Amxi? Who are you dating? Kryjtep. But we haven't met for a long time. I don't like him anymore. - Do you think that he likes you? - I don't know. I just don't want to deal with him anymore. - I think everyone has noticed that. - What do you mean? Let's bathe! It's cold. Look, there's Amxi! Let's go there. K?t?! Are you hungry? Do you wanna eat? Did you hear the shots last night? No. The other day, a candidate came to the village to speak to the community. He offered us 10 Reais to vote for him but no one accepted, and he left very angry. We've heard that he went to our sign in the road, the one that says: ''Pedra Branca, Indigenous Territory'', and filled it with bullets. The sign got full of holes. Tepto doesn't stop crying. I don't know what else to do. He must be hungry. Did you breastfeed him? He didn't eat anything. He has already suckled. What can we do? This may be because of the mecar?. You should look for a shaman and ask him to talk with the mecar? to find out who's disturbing Tepto. The shaman is the only one who can see and give Jenipapo fruit, tobacco or ashes to protect his body. This way, Tepto will calm down and sleep. If he cries again, I'll call you, Grandfather. Then you take care of Tepto and use something to calm him down. This dawn... If he keeps crying, wake me up and I'll try to help, even though it's not my duty. But tomorrow, you go look for a shaman. Only he can know who is harming the child and making him cry. Shamans are like that. Sometimes, they don't like us and invoke a curse. But they can also do us good and cure us. Nowadays, some shamans die young. In old days, it was even worse. If he invoked a curse on someone, the family would take revenge and kill him. I don't like these shamans, but I respect those who cure people. I've suffered a lot because of shamans that harmed me. I don't like being even close to them. They aren't reliable at all. There are many shamans that do bad things. Shamans that use magic to kill. K?t?, that night... I... I went to the waterfall. The big one, you know? Do you know the one I'm talking about? The one with the highest fall. I went there... because I dreamed of my father, that he was in those waters. I went after him, called him, ans he made a request. I only heard his voice. Then... He asked me to organize the feast for the end of the mourning so he can leave for the dead's village. He wanted to take me with him, but I didn't go. I'll talk to my kin, we must prepare the log. Why didn't you tell me? I asked, but you said nothing. I... I haven't talked to anyone about what's going on. I don't want anybody to think that I speak with the dead, that I'm becoming a shaman, so I decided to keep my mouth shut. I know. Mother, let's go to the city to buy another machete. This one doesn't cut anymore. I can go, but they won't sell me. My debt is too big, I don't want to go to the city. The shop owner will be rude to me, even if the money is mine. You can use that old machete. Just sharpen it on the stone so it will cut anything again. Mother! What is it? I asked for a new machete because we must go to the swidden. Ihj?c wants to work on the land to end his father's funerary feast. You should really go and prepare the food for the feast. If you miss me, come to see me. And if I miss you and Tepto I will go there to visit you. You'd better plant it fast to make the log race soon. Yeah... I will miss you, and I will miss my friends too. Maybe Ihj?c could go alone. But it's better if we both go. So we work together. Let me see the color of your nail polish. This nail polish... Is this the ''Hot Kiss'' nail polish? Everyone is using it. Sit down to eat. Here, Mother. Where did you find this moriche palm fruit? Close to Cupak?'s swidden there's a tree full of fruits. Mother... It's been a while since Father died. I already have a wife and son but we haven't finished our mourning yet. Let's make the funerary feast. So we don't miss him anymore and Father can follow his way. I've also been thinking about it. We need to harvest all manioc that your father planted and invite our kin for the log race. It's been a while since he died. But you never went to his swidden again. You are my oldest son. I count on you to help me. Don't worry, Mother. We will go to the swidden in a few days. I have talked to Uncle and Grandpa. They will also help. We will do it right. We will clear off the swidden, then burn and sow it. It will take a while. Then, back to the village we will make a beautiful funerary feast. That's all I want. Good morning, Ropox?t. Let's go, people! Let's work! Stop with the laziness! Grandpa, has Tepto already eaten? No, we were waiting for you to get up and breast-feed him. This old post is full of mecar?, it's gonna be difficult to hunt. No prey will come by. The mecar? make them run. They will come. Animals have no fear. There's a lot of food here. If prey comes, we kill it and go back to the swidden at night. It won't take long, there are many footprints here. I was still little, very little, when my mother brought me here. She used to speak about this place and brought me here to see it. I was still a child, but I liked a lot to be here. I spent hours looking at this house, while the post chiefs from the Indian Protection Service were building things. Who were they? Eli and Jones. They've built this house. Eli's room was here and Jones' one was there. They used to bring their wives to stay here for a while. This post hosted all Krah? people: from Galheiro, from Cachoeira... Sick persons came here to take medicines and be treated. The government has built the post after the massacre. Farmers hunted us without respite. They chased us like animals. There are many stories from that time. My mother told me a lot about what happened before the construction of the post. Those stories are still in my memory. I grew up, but they have never left me. Stories of the massacre, when the farmers killed our people. I still remember well. Come, Ihj?c! - Help me! - Wait, Uncle! I'm coming! Our fire almost burned the manioc. The land got much better now. We can grow rice and corn. Manioc is better, we have little. Let's harvest everything for the feast. Old man! Old Crate! I need you. There are lots of macaws up there. I'm listening. Ihj?c... You... You are becoming a shaman. That's the reason of your pain. Do you feel it? No. I don't want to become a shaman. I feel sick, very tired. Why is this happening to me? Your master, the Macaw, is doing this to you. Yes. She has been visiting me for a while, I don't understand what she wants. I'm scared. I'm still very young. I don't want that for me. In the swidden, there are spirits, animals, entities. You will begin to see them. I was also young when I became a shaman. The mecar?... I know them well. That's why I can cure the sick. So help us, my son is very ill. He is very weak. Help him to get better. I will talk to the Macaw. But you must know... She wants you, she won't leave you alone. Maybe she will never forget you. Wait, I'm going to talk to her. I'm leaving. I don't wanna go through this. Haven't you heard what the shaman said? You can't escape. Your master, the Macaw, won't forget you. She won't leave you alone. No. I'm going away. I'm going to town. So she will forget me, and I can come back. I don't like this Macaw, I can't fight her. Sit up, boy. - What's your name? - Ihj?c. - And your white's name? - Henrique. - What more? - Krah?. Henrique Ihj?c Krah?. What are you feeling? My head aches and my eye hot. My eye hot, my body also hot. But it's not outside, it's inside. Give me your ID. This is your social security card, I need your ID. That green document, with your picture in it. I don't have it. - Don't you have an ID? - No, I don't. Why don't you have it yet? Because I heard you cannot get one here. Then I haven't done mine yet. I need your ID... Your father's name? Paulinho Jos? Roptyc Krah?. - Your mother's name? - Rosilene Amcrokwyj. - Rosilene what? - Amcrokwyj Krah?. I'll leave it blank, I don't know how to write it. Why aren't they here with you? Father is dead, and Mother has to take care of my brothers. She can't leave home. She has to stay there. - What's your village? - Pedra Branca. It's far away. How did you get here? You didn't come by car. No, because... I was in the swidden. I couldn't call you from there. Then I decided to wall on the path, I took the road... Then I took a ride and got here. And your National Health card? - I need it to register you. - What? I don't know what's it, this Health card... Wait, I'll call the base and ask someone to accompany you. I'll ask if they have information to complete the form. Wait a little. Do you speak Portuguese? A little... Open and close the hand a little. Like that... Keep it closed. I will inject some serum in you. Then you do some exams next week. If everything is good, you'll go to the Support House. First time in the Support House? I've never seen you around. I only came once, some time ago. I came with my wife, when our son was born. So you came before, when your wife had a baby. - Yes. - But why not in the village? The doctor said that it's risky there. But you have good midwives experts in natural childbirth. There was never any death in the hands of a Krah? midwife. - What does hypochondriac mean? - Did the doctor said that? He thinks that you have problems. You believe that you are sick. But you are not sick, you are healthy. No, I'm sick. I haven't been feeling well for some time. I'm telling you the truth about what the doctor said. That's why he only recommended paracetamol and some rest. Here's your people, kin from many villages. The nurse monitors each 3 hours. If you don't feel well, tell them and they'll take you to the hospital. Have you seen anyone from Pedra Branca? No, nobody. - Has any car arrived lately? - No, it's been a while... It's me, Ihj?c. I'm calling to ask if you are good. Wait... I won't come back now. Let the Macaw forget me. Please, ask Old Crate to come and see me and say if I can go back already, or if I should stay more. Wait, Mother... What about K?t?, is she still in the swidden? Is K?t? in the swidden? I'm staying in the Support House. There's no telephone there. I came to F?tima and asked her to make a call. There are people from other villages at the Support House. No one from Pedra Branca. Yesterday, Uncle showed up there. The one who lives in Kenpojkre village. He was thinking of my father and crying over the memories of him. He cried a lot and asked for my father's log. He asked to be warned since he wants to be at the funerary feast. Yes, food is good. But some days it's kinda bad. But that's just the way it is. Is it raining there already? I know... Ok, that's all. Ask the shaman right away if he can come to see me. So I can go back. When you look at me, I get embarrassed My heart races, I stay by your side I drink beer, trying to forget you But I think that I don't deserve you I drink beer, trying to forget you But when I close my eyes, I see you My friends say that I'm not ordinary But passion confuses people's minds I drink beer, trying to forget you Ihj?c, are you ok? Have you packed your things? Today we go to the village, ok? - Where to? - Our car is waiting for you. - I'm not going back yet. - Let's go to the village fast. Your wife and son are waiting. They are waiting. You better go or you will be stuck here. If you don't go, you'll be on your own. I won't go to, things are still bad for me. Then you'll be on your own, ok? You'll have to find a way later. Henrique Krah?! Junior will go to Kenpojkre ?gua Branca, Cachoeira and P? de Coco. I'm gonna tell him. What is it? Gueto came to the Support House. Then he told me to leave. Yes, you can go. He told me to come here and talk with you. It's no use talking with me. You've been here too long. What else do you want? Why do you want to stay in town for so long? We can't keep you here any longer. Help me. I want to stay a little longer. Henrique, the Support House is for sick people. You've already been treated, you are healthy. You need to go. Dr. Marcia will only come this afternoon. Ok, put those papers in my desk. But I'm not healthy. You don't understand Krah?'s life. Neither the sickness. You don't understand White people's life. I'm full of work here and you're disturbing me. A car is leaving for Pedra Branca If I were you I'd leave in that car. From now on, you are not under our responsibility anymore. If you don't go, you'll be on the streets. I see... It's no use to staring at me. You'll get in this car and go back to your village. I may go back, but if I die, it will be your fault. My fault! Are you crazy? Nobody will die, boy. Let me do my work. I may get in the car and leave... But if I die... It will really be your fault. Why didn't you get in that car? They've left me behind. They've cheated on us. I can't help you today. I have to leave early tomorrow, I need to close the house, it's not possible. I have many things to do. No, I really need to stay here. I don't know anyone here. I'm alone, I don't have friends. I would rather stay here. But I can't, you have to find another place. I don't know anyone here. You know that I am Krah?, right? I know. Try the National Indian Foundation or the Health Agency that runs the Support House. Go there while it's still open. Let me in... Man, you'll have to find a way. Look, I've already talked to him, I tried many times. It's very difficult, you know. From Pedra Branca. Henrique Krah?. Henrique, yes. I should've left at dawn to Aragua?na and I'm still here. I don't wanna let him on the streets. Whose problem is it then? You must solve it. But he is here and I'm leaving. What you gonna do? It's your responsibility. You are the Health Agency. Let's stay in town a little longer. The Macaw still wants me. - We go back to the Support House. - No. We leave on Monday. The Support House is temporary, not for staying. There are many sick persons, it's not a good place for Tepto. That place is dangerous. I don't like it there. K?t?? K?t?, are you sleeping? Yes. Be quiet and sleep. I can't sleep. My eyes hurt. My heart is beating fast. Beating strong. Be quiet and try to sleep. K?t?, even in the city I still feel threatened by my master. Try to rest, tomorrow we'll arrive in the village. The shaman will cure you. Stop thinking bad things and try to sleep. I don't feel sleepy. I feel bad. Stop thinking. Come on, let's go home. Get in! Give Tepto to me! Stay with me a little longer. Then we go back together. Let's go home. Our life is not here. This is not our place. The Macaw will end up forgetting me. Give me Tepto and let's go. I'm afraid. Stop that. Give Tepto to me. Tepto! Get in! No. I'm not ready yet. The Macaw still wants me. You forgot about your father. Who's there? I need help! Are you listening? Call Old Crate! Yes, Old Crate! What? Speak louder! Ok. I need his help! I want to go back to the village. Go after him! What? I cannot hear you! Son, when you were away, I was afraid you wouldn't come back. I had to come back. To finish Father's log. The moment has come. He must depart now. With this log, your father's spirit must be happy. Our kin have arrived in the village for the funerary feast. They have the feeling of longing. Everyone will race tomorrow, after we cry, it's gonna be over. His spirit will also forget the grief and depart for the dead's village. When I lived in the city, I used to think about Father. He was always on my mind. I was always thinking about him, without ever forgetting. Let's make the log look beautiful, well painted and feathered. He will be happy with his body adorned. Spread it well to cover the leaves. That's good. Can I put the meat on? Spread the manioc a little more. Put the meat in the middle. Are they making the fire already? Bring more leaves. You must finish fast. Let's bring it to the fire! Bring the manioc cake here! On this side, it has more rocks. - Are you cold? - No. The singing goes on until morning. Let's stay here. Tepto's not crying anymore. Go! Go! Hold this log! Faster! It's time, my people. Let's remember him for the last time. Ihj?c came back and prepared the log. Our kin came, gathered and raced. Now, nobody will remember him. Forget his absence, he's gone. The time of remembering is gone. Think about our children and grandchildren now. Think about the living. Let's not cry anymore. This is how it's gonna be now. In your dreams, don't take food from the mecar? and don't make love with them. Refuse their tobacco, their paintings. Don't get carried away. I know that you are still sad, Ihj?c. It's been tough for you, but it's not over yet. We must take care of our house, our swidden, our son. Listen to what he's saying. I know, but I look to the log and keep thinking about my father. As if he was still walling around here. No, your father's gone already. Stop remembering, be careful. K?t?... Things have changed. I'm not the same anymore. The mecar?... I can see them now. I know the soul of things. They talk to me. Now, I'm like this. What can I do? Spotting : Muriel P?rez
