[MUSIC PLAYING] [ANTS CHIRPING] [ANTS SWARMING] [ANTS CHIRPING] [SCARY MUSIC PLAYING] I picked this one out just for you. I think you're going to like it. Oh now, don't worry about it. The slugs, they're for free in here. So you're going to take this home, and use it for your botany project, OK? Remember, don't you water it after midnight. [LAUGHING] I'm only kidding. Don't worry about it. Miguel? Charlie? [CHIRPING] [SIGHS] Miguel! Have you seen Miguel? Nope. Aw, man. [SIGHS] How about Charlie? Have you see Charlie? Aw, no. [ENGINE STARTS] All right, we're out of here. [CHIRPING] Miguel? [MUSIC PLAYING] [CHIRP] Crikey, Sharon, today! SHARON: Coming, Ms. Highsmith. And I don't know how many times I have told you not to call me Ms. Highsmith. It's Joan, just Joan. I want you to think of us as equals. Of course. Sorry, Ms. Joan. [SARCASTIC LAUGH] Ta. Excuse me, ladies? I know it's Saturday and all, but would you mind? [SCOFFS] Sure, Charlie. It's Jack, Ms. Highsmith. Oh, whatever. Working the weekend, Ms. Highsmith? What's my motto, Sharon? If you don't come to work on Saturday, don't bother coming in on Sunday. JOAN: [LAUGHING] And that is why "Hurray!" magazine is number one at checkout stands all over the country. Because we work on Saturday. JACK: Ms. Highsmith, the cigarette. Oh. Hm. Nazi. Don't bother, Sharon. I've already signed you in. [WATER SLOSHING] I'm sorry. [SCOFFS] Oh, no, no. That's OK. No, I'll get it. No, no, no, I got it. No, no, no, I got it. Ow! Oh! [GASPING] I'm sorry. Are you OK? Here. I'm sorry about that. Oh. Um, here. [ELEVATOR DINGS] Thank you. [SCOFFS] JOAN: Sharon? Sharon! I've-- Got to go. Yeah. Hey! What the heck would you do that for? To remind you of why you're here. I know why I'm here, to mop the floors. You ought to be grateful to get any kind of a job at all! You know, they're not a hell of a lot of people out there anxious to hire a guy who's only claim to fame is his ability to hotwire a car. You know, I was making a little money back then, Uncle Hank. Oh, yeah, sure, till you got caught. And they sent you to the state institution. You want to go back there? No, damn straight, you don't. Now here-- now listen to me, if you work hard, keep your nose clean, who knows? You might-- you just might someday pick up one of these. OK? Yeah. [SIGHS] Go back to state. [WATER SLOSHING] [MUSIC PLAYING] Uh, why don't you, uh, shoot those trees, uh, right over there by the window. We've got more trees here than in a fucking forest. Well, I don't think Miguel would do anything like this. He's been a good worker for months for me now. Well, where does Miguel live? Well, he-- actually, Sheriff, he w-- well, kind of, you know-- he-- What do you mean? He's just around and about? Yeah, he kind of works for me. Well, we need to talk to him right away. And-- I can't be giving you any of the stuff inside, Sheriff. I know that. Sheriff Hansen? Yes, ma'am. What can I do for you? Agent Lucero, USDA. They told me I could find you out here. Uh-huh. And how can I help the Department of Agriculture today? Well, we're conducting an investigation into illegally-imported flora. And we tracked several of the shipments to supply houses in this area. [POLICE RADIO CHATTER] And I was just hoping I could have your full cooperation during our procedures. Uh, flora-- you mean like plants? Yes, plants, trees, bushes, shrubs. Well, this is a nursery. All right, look, uh, Agent Lucero-- It's Lucero. But please, call me Elizabeth. [POLICE RADIO CHATTER] We like to stay on a first-name basis with the locals. Uh, Elizabeth, I'll tell you what. You just continue with your very important work. And if you need any assistance, please feel free to call my office. I'll get right back to you just as soon as I can. Now, in the meantime, if you'll excuse me. I have a situation on my hand here. ELIZABETH: Well, is there anything I can help you with? SHERIFF: I don't think so. It's not exactly an agricultural problem. Well, actually I'm new to the USDA. I originally started out in the FBI. Really? Why the career change? [SCARY MUSIC PLAYING] Oh. [BIRDS CHIRPING] FBI, huh? [MUSIC PLAYING] I'm only going to be a minute. I promise. Oh, like you promised not to work today? Look, I know what I said, Carly. But something really important came up that I have to deal with. Dad, we get one day a week together. You can't do this any other time? No, I'm afraid not. It's got to be today. You know, Mom says you're a workaholic. She says that's why she divorced you. Yeah? Well, you know what? Your mom says a lot of things. That doesn't necessarily mean that they're true. What's this? For you. I don't accept bribes, Dad. Open it. You might change your mind. Can you leave the keys so I can play the radio? Sorry, I need them. Look in the bag. Carly! [SCOFFS] [CHUCKLING] [HEAVY METAL MUSIC PLAYING] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Cal. Huh? Jesus Christ! Close. I am Bob. Hello. Do you hear me in there? I am Bob. This is Sam, my spiritual advisor. And of course, you must know Mila and LuLu. LuLu? I shot the for last month's Paris "Vogue." You saw it? No, I don't imagine you did. We're here for the shoot on the roof. Oh. Oh, yeah, right. They left me a message about this. You're a photographer, right? He, he, he. I'm not a photographer. I am the photographer. And as much as I would love to continue this enchanting conversation, I'm losing the light. Which way to the roof, please? Oh, just take that elevator up to the penthouse, and make a right. I can take you up there if you want. I think, no. It's a roof. I'm sure we'll be able to find it. Andiamo. [SCOFFS] Who is this? Dr. Everett Portman. And? SHARON: And he was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize this year for outstanding work with children in war-torn countries. Oh. Uh-uh. This is "Hooray!" "Hooray!" We want stars. We want new stars. We want new, hot stars, not some ancient pedophile who can't even keep his eyes open. Oh, sorry. Um, I-- I didn't know anybody was here. Oh, well, now you know. [SCOFFS] Get out! Um, excuse me. Think! Who will be the fresh new face to adorn the cover of our Fresh New Faces issue? Brad Pitt? Over. Johnny Depp? Weird. J. Lo? If her brains were in her ass, she'd be a genius. Look, I think you better go make some coffee. This is going to be an overnighter. But-- What? I'll be right back. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Hey. Hey. Um, Curtis. Sharon. Uh, yeah. [SCOFFS] I'm sorry about that back there. Oh, no, no, no, don't worry about that. That was nothing. She's really not that bad once you get to know her. Well, you know, I mean, I'm just a janitor, right? I mean, she doesn't have to know me. And I don't have to know her. And that's the way I'd like to keep it. Oh, great. [ELECTRICITY BUZZING] What's that? It's probably just another brownout or something. This city's so damn bankrupt, we'll probably working by candlelight next week. [CHUCKLES] I'm going to make some coffee. Do you want some? Uh, you know? I know what you're up to. All right. And don't worry about it. I mean, it's OK. It was my fault back there. Maybe some other time. Some other time. [ELEVATOR DINGS] [ANTS CHIRPING] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Yes, Ms. Highsmith, I know you're trying to work. Yes, ma'am, I know you pay a great deal of rent. But, uh, there's nothing I can say except-- Uh, it's OK, Mrs. Highsmith, maintenance is here now. He'll check it out. No, ma'am, I'm not going to tell him that. Thank you. Yeah, I know. I know. I got your page. It's happening like this all over the building. So I'm going to go, and check out the main breaker now. Yeah, whatever, man. Just hurry up, OK? I swear, that woman must have been in the Navy. Jeez. [ELECTRICITY BUZZING] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [ANTS CHIRPING] Does she take one or two? I don't remember. [ANTS CHIRPING] She does. No, she-- [ELECTRICITY BUZZING] Shoot. God, not today. Today. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [ANTS CHIRPING] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [ELECTRICITY BUZZING] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [KNOCKING] Hello, anybody here? [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [COMPUTER DINGS] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Ow! [GASPS] [THUD] Guess you should have ducked. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Jesus Christ. Just in case. [DRAIN POPS OFF] [SCARY MUSIC PLAYING] [YELLS] [BREATHING HEAVILY] [SCREAMING] [SCARY MUSIC PLAYING] [ELECTRICITY BUZZING] [ELEVATOR DINGS] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [SPARKS FLYING] [GRUNTS] Jesus Christ. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Hey, Warner, uh, it's me, Hank. I've never seen anything like this. I mean, the wires aren't cut. Uh, there's no rust or corrosion. But it looks like they've been chewed through. Cut, chewed, whatever. Can you fix it? [SCOFFS] Yeah, I probably can. But it's going to take a hell of a lot of time. I'm going to need some very special tools for this. Great. What am I going to tell Joan Highsmith? [ANTS CHIRPING] [SCREAMS] Hank? [STATIC] Hank, are you still there? Hank? [HEAVY METAL MUSIC PLAYING] [ELEVATOR BUZZING] [POWER SHUTS OFF] Great. [HITS BALL] Huh. [ELECTRICITY BUZZING] Oh, for crying out loud. [SCOFFS] [SCARY MUSIC PLAYING] Sharon! Sharon! Sharon, where the hell are you? Ugh, this building. I knew I should have rented in Westwood. Sharon, you can forget about the coffee. Let's just take the work to a restaurant or some-- [BREATHING HEAVILY] What the hell is that? [SCARY MUSIC PLAYING] Screw you, Jiminy Cricket. [ANT CHIRPING LOUDLY] [SCARY MUSIC PLAYING] Yuck! Well, that's it. End of story. Huh. Come on. Let's go. [BREATHING HEAVILY] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Come on. It's not possible. Ants don't get that big. [GASPING] Nobody told that one. Come on. Uh oh! [ANTS CRAWLING] Oh, my god. [SCARY MUSIC PLAYING] What do we do now? I don't know. This is the longest time I've ever spent in a kitchen in my life. We need everything we can find, a can opener, a knife or something, use it as a weapon. Oh, great, Sharon. We'll flip it to death. [GASPING] Well, that thing sucked down a whole cup of coffee. And I don't think it was interested in the caffeine. Maybe we can use some sugar. That is a great idea. Calm down. Come on, we'll try it. Come on. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Here, ants, dinner. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] They're eating! [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Great. Come on. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Oh! D-- doesn't anything work in this damn place? It's not just this floor. The power's probably out in the whole building. Well, I'm not waiting around to file a complaint. Come on. Let's take the stairs. Now look, Miss-- Lucero or Agent Lucero. Agent Lucero, I've tried to tell you before. All our suppliers are bona fide importers. I don't use any black market people. It ain't worth it. Now, if you don't mind, we're a little shorthanded today. In fact, I've got a guy out on a delivery over three hours. Jeez! Hey, have you seen Charlie? Go look for him. Would you mind if I look around a little? Suit yourself. Hey, listen, if you don't mind working for minimum wage, you can pitch in and help out. [CHUCKLING] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] - Wait. - What? Wait. My shoes. Oh, honestly, Sharon. How do you expect to get anywhere in life if you can't do everything in heels? [ANTS CHIRPING] Do you hear that? [ANTS CHIRPING] Yes. They're coming. Well, let's not stand here and listen. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [GASPING] [SCARY MUSIC PLAYING] [GRUNTS] [GOLF CLUB CLATTERING] [SCARY MUSIC PLAYING] [ANTS CHIRPING] Oh! A smart woman knows what to do when she's in trouble. Help! Help! [HITTING DOOR] Help! [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [GROANING] Oh, great. Now they're going to think I'm stealing stuff. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Oh, god. Hey! Help us! Open the door. [SCREAMING] [SIGHS] Man. [SCREAMING IN DISTANCE] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Help! Help! Open the door! Open the door! [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [SCREAMING] What's going on? Oh, Shut the door! What's the matter? [SCREAMING] [SCARY MUSIC PLAYING] [ANTS CHIRPING] [SCREAMING] [SCARY MUSIC PLAYING] [GASPING] That is one big ant. [BREATHING HEAVILY] [GASPING] ELIZABETH: Sierra Gardens Nursery. Owner says he's clean. Seems OK. But I found some strange marks on some of his larger growth plants. They almost seem insect-like. But the bite radius is just too large for anything indigenous. I'm going to take a sample back to the office. The local yokels are all over the corpse they found earlier, some worker named Miguel. I think it was a mountain lion attack. Hard to tell yet. [BIRDS CHIRPING] [GRUNTING] [SCREAMING] Jesus H. Christ. She found Charlie. [INSECTS BUZZING] [STATIC] Hank? Come on, man. Talk to me. Are you down there? [STATIC] Where are you? [STATIC] CURTIS (OVER INTERCOM): Uncle Hank, it's Curtis. Can you come in, please? Hello? Uncle Hank, come in. [BREATHING HEAVILY] Where the hell is everybody? You don't think maybe those things killed him? My Uncle Hank is the next boxing champion I think he can handle a couple of ants. Did you have to bring that thing in here? Well, I just wanted to look at it in the light. How did it get that big? JOAN: Maybe they work out. The phone is still dead. Excuse me? Excuse me? But-- is this your desk? No. So what are you going through other people's stuff? I guess you don't know that I know everything about everybody who works in this building, including people like you who have been guests of the state. Surprised? Yeah, Mr. Clean here has had vacation time at the state pen. Bingo. Is that loaded? Yup. Uh, hey, Grandmaster Puffy Thug, how about if I take care of that for you? Do you even know how to use one of these things? I have been on the board of directors of the Beverly Hills Gun Club for five years. I think I can handle it. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Yeah, yeah, still no signal. [SIGHS] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [GASPING] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [ANTS CRAWLING] [YELLS] What the hell was that? [BREATHING HEAVILY] [ANTS CHIRPING] [SCREAMING] [STRUGGLING] Oh, no! [ANTS CHIRPING] Back off! [SCARY MUSIC PLAYING] [STRUGGLING] [SCARY MUSIC PLAYING] [GRUNTING] [ANT CHIRPING LOUDER] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [GROANS] CURTIS: All right, the coast is clear. - The stairs are over here. - What? We can't take the stairs. [SCOFFS] This little baby says I can. Well, even if you are a perfect shot, which I doubt you are, you don't have enough ammo in that thing to make it past the sixth floor. [SIGHS] And I guess you have a better idea. The elevator. Hello, power is out, Einstein. No, no, we're not going to take it. I just need to get the doors open. There's a maintenance shaft in there. I mean, it's not much. It's just four cement walls and a ladder. But it'll definitely take us up to the roof. The roof? Now why would we want to go to the roof? Well, I've been thinking about this, OK? I mean, they're just ants, right? I mean, they're big, but they still think like ants. So? So, to them, this place is the big ant farm. They're making an ant hill. Exactly. And everything down below is just their nesting grounds. So if we can make it up to the roof before they do, maybe we could signal somebody for help. I don't know, a news helicopter, cops, anybody. Yes. I heard you're very good at attracting the police. Look, I've had about enough of this. I'm going come on, Sharon. Sharon? [SCOFFS] You can come with me, or you can stay here and be ant food. It's up to you. I'm going to the roof. Well, maybe my new assistant will know the difference between hot and not. You're fired. Whatever. OK, look, are you ready for this? No. Good. Let's go. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Thank you. Does this happen every time? I've tried hypnosis, acupuncture, repressed memory therapy. Nothing works. Well, the FBI isn't all it's cracked up to be. At least you're federal. Yeah, right. Hey, Sheriff. You got a sec? Sure. It's OK. Go ahead. You know Miguel, the body we found earlier today? I was doing a prelim on him, took a blood and tissue sample just to check. Yeah? I found traces-- significant traces of formic acid. Since this guy seemed to be in the same shape, I just did a quick check on him. And guess what I found? I'm going to go out on a limb and say formic acid. MEDICAL EXAMINER: Bingo. You don't get it, do you? Formic acid is not a naturally occurring element in the human body. Are you saying that's how they were killed? No, you couldn't kill somebody with it, unless you drowned them in it. I checked it out. Formic acid is the active ingredient in the saliva of the [INAUDIBLE] Oh, my god. The what? Your victims were eaten by ants. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Hank? Hey, Hank, you still down here? Hank? Where the hell are you? Hank? [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Ah! [BREATHING HEAVILY] Oh, my god. [ANTS CHIRPING] [SCARY MUSIC PLAYING] Oh, shit! [SCARY MUSIC PLAYING] [BREATHING HEAVILY] [SCARY MUSIC PLAYING] [BOTH SCREAMING] Let me in. Open the door. Come on. Please, open the door! [SCARY MUSIC PLAYING] [ANTS CHIRPING] There it is. [BREATHING HEAVILY] OK, listen. It's pretty simple. All you have to do is hold on tight, and don't look down. All right? - OK. I'm going to go first. I'll help you across. Just be careful with the first step, OK? [SCREAMING] Curtis! Just kidding. [SCOFFS] Thanks a lot. DENNIS: Hey! Do you hear that? DENNIS: Hello? There. Is somebody down there? Yeah. I'm stuck in the elevator. Be careful. [INAUDIBLE] up there. Yeah, we know. Are you all right? Well, I'm peppy. I need help. OK, uh, I'll be right down. I'm not going anywhere. You said-- I know what I said. What am I going to do, leave him there? I'll be right back. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [ANTS CHIRPING] What are these things? Honestly, I don't exactly know. [SIGHS] What's your name? Carly. What are you doing down here, Carly? My dad had to get something from his office. He said he'd only be a couple of minutes. I guess I fell asleep. Uh-huh. Well, I'm Jack Warner Are you a security guard? JACK: Yeah. No, offense, Jack Warner, but you're doing a really lousy job. [ANTS CHIRPING] When they find me missing, somebody will be come looking for us. Just as long as we stay in the car, we'll be safe. They can't get in here. [ANT BANGS WINDOW] [SCREAMING] [BREATHING HEAVILY] It's OK. It's nothing to worry about. I don't suppose your dad left you the keys, did he? No. I don't suppose you have a gun, do you? No. [ANTS CHIRPING] [BREATHING HEAVILY] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Hey. Bad day for an elevator ride, huh? You think? Listen. My daughter, she's in the garage. You don't-- you don't think those-- you don't think those things got to her, do you? Look, don't worry about her right now, OK? We're going to get you out of here first. And then we'll take care of her. Can you stand up on that thing? [GASPS] CURTIS: You all right? Man, I don't know what those things stunned me with. But I feel like crap. OK, look out. I'm coming down. [GRUNTS] Ooh! Oh, god. It looks like you held your own in here. Big bugs. How's your leg doing? Oh, that's pretty nasty. Don't sugar coat it. OK, look, this is the deal. If we can't get you up through there, then we're going to go out the doors. I already tried. It didn't work. Yeah, that's because you didn't have the magic key. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [GROANS] All right, let's go. Bad idea. [SCARY MUSIC PLAYING] God, it's stuck. [SCARY MUSIC PLAYING] Go! Go! Get up there now! Go, go, come on! [SCARY MUSIC PLAYING] [GRUNTING] All right, there you go. Go. Go! [GROANING] [SCARY MUSIC PLAYING] [STRUGGLING] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Go, go! Just go! [SCARY MUSIC PLAYING] [GUN SHOT] [ANT CHIRPING LOUDLY] Ha, ha, ha! Like fish in a barrel. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [GUN SHOT] [ANTS CHIRPING] Just one more. Come on. [SIGHS] Too bad. I was just beginning to like this. I'm sure there'll be another chance. Yeah, you think? [ANTS CHIRPING] What are we going to do? We couldn't get out if we wanted to. [SIGHS] [HONKS HORN] Get off the car! Ants don't hear. They feel. That's what their antennae are for, so that they can get vibrations. That's how they talk to each other. I did a project at school. We need some bad vibrations, so maybe they'll get lost. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Do you think that this would work? It's worth a shot. Let's see if they like heavy metal trash. [HEAVY METAL MUSIC PLAYING] [ANTS CHIRPING] [HEAVY METAL MUSIC PLAYING] [LAUGHING] [HEAVY METAL MUSIC PLAYING] All right, back off, bugs. Don't you mess with me. Oh, you want a piece to this? I can turn this thing up as loud as I want to, babies! [GASPING] [GROANING] I can think of better things to do on my Saturday. What are you doing here? You were supposed to take the stairs. What happened? [SCOFFS] Well, what do you think happened? It was so dark, I couldn't see anything at all. And I turned left instead of right and accidentally came back here. SHARON: Wait, do you feel that? What, the fresh air? [BREATHING HEAVILY] OK, it's the air conditioning shaft. It leads out onto the roof. Well, how do we get through it? Well, what do you usually do when you got a problem around here? Call maintenance! That's right. You call maintenance. [GROANING] Watch out, OK? Look out below! [METAL CLANKING] Huh! [BREATHING HEAVILY] How am I going to do this? [HEAVY METAL MUSIC PLAYING] OK, there's our way out of here. We're almost home. [HEAVY METAL MUSIC PLAYING] I was afraid of this. What's wrong? Power is out for the gates, too. I'm going to have to open it manually. Don't let me stop you. [HEAVY METAL MUSIC PLAYING] [CLUNKING] There's some light down here. I think we can get out. [GASPING] Can I ask you something? [GROANING] What? Well, what happened to you? I mean, how do you get in trouble? You don't really seem like the jail type. DENNIS: You were in jail? Oh, great, now everybody knows. So what happened? [SIGHS] I took stuff. What kind of stuff? I-- I stole cars, OK? I was a car thief. I could jack anything under 60 seconds, all right? JOAN: Your parents must be really proud of you. Come on. Can we move it? - [SIGHS] Sure. Thanks. [GASPING] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [ANTS CHIRPING] [SCARY MUSIC PLAYING] [HEAVY METAL MUSIC PLAYING] What are they doing? I don't know. Don't be afraid. They hate the sound. As long as we've got the music, we're OK. Warner, you better hurry up. Just keep an eye out. Let me know if we got anything to worry about. Uh, we have something to worry about. The batteries are dying. Just give me a second. Batteries are dead! Almost there. OK, not that one. [ANTS CHIRPING] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Warner, they're coming! Damn it! Warner, they're-- they're getting closer. Run for the car. Warner, we got to go! [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Go! Ah! [SCREAMING] Warner! [SCREAMING] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [WARNER SCREAMING IN BACKGROUND] [ANTS CHIRPING] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [CAMERA CLICKS] PAOLO: Perfect, darling, perfect. Give me more anguish, more guilt. You hate to be beautiful. Show me how you hate to be beautiful. [CAMERA CLICKS] Toss them like a little girl. Yes, come on. Eh. [CAMERA CLICKS] Ah, yes, yes, yes! [CAMERA CLICKS] Paolo, I'm bored. When are we going to finish? Soon, darling, soon. Have some more champagne. [CAMERA CLICKING] Somebody is out there. Hey! Will you open the vent, please? [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [CAMERA CLICKS] Naughty, naughty, [INAUDIBLE] Oi! [CAMERA CLICKS] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Paolo, there are people in the air conditioner. Of course, there are, darling. [CAMERA CLICKING] Why are you in the air conditioner? Look, just open the vent, OK? I don't know how. [CAMERA CLICKING] [ANTS CHIRPING] Stay back. Would you give me the gun, please? Give me a second. [GUN SHOT] No, no, no. What is that? [ANTS CHIRPING] What do you doing? CURTIS: We got some serious trouble in here! Could you just open the vent? [GUN SHOT] [ANTS CHIRPING] - Ah, ha, ha! Sam, Sam! CURTIS: Let us out of the vent. [GUN SHOTS] [GASPING] [ANTS CHIRPING] Come get me! Help me! Come here. [SCREAMING] Oh, no! [SCREAMING] No! [SCARY MUSIC PLAYING] Look out. [SCREAMING] [SCARY MUSIC PLAYING] Well, he put up quite a little fuss. But I got his delivery orders right here. He made a shipment to the Walden Building, downtown LA. Did you call your people? I called. Hey, what are-- Sorry, Sheriff. What is this? It's worse than we thought. It better be. [BREATHING HEAVILY] That looks awful. Are you OK? How do you feel? How do you think I feel? It hurts like hell. Where's the damn helicopters? The one day you need them, they're nowhere to be found. Yes, yes, that's what I said. We are trapped on the roof of that Walden Building. There are giant arms trying to kill us. Hello? Hello? Here, let me try. They have to believe someone. It's no use. The phone is dead. [SIGHS] How far away do you think that building is over there? SHARON: Too far to jump. Yeah? What about to climb? See that telephone wire? SHARON: Yeah. It's not going to hold us. Don't be so sure. Hey, Sam! [CAR LOCKS CHIRP] Since when is the US Department of Agriculture in the business of kidnapping police officers? I'm sorry, Ed. These are desperate times. They require desperate measures. This section of the USDA is so secret that the president doesn't even know it exists. The least you can do is tell me what the hell is going on. This is a ship called the Skyward Dragon. It was docked two weeks ago with some produce, some food, the usual. But the FBI was alerted that there was a possible link to a terrorist cell located out of Nevada. They found a half a ton of plutonium in the ship's hold, part of a missing stockpile from Iraq. They seized it and most of the cargo. Most? After the final count, they found 12 small trees were missing. No, it didn't seem important at first. Until after the tests were done, it showed that the plutonium seal had been leaking. So it leaked out onto the trees. And whatever was in the trees, as well. The ants? The ants. Now the lifecycle of an ant is 40 to 65 days. So with a metabolic rate like that, the effects of radiation can be significant. Ah, you're kidding me, right? Radioactive ants. From the look of the victims, you can see how their predatory behavior has been completely amplified. Uh, angry, radioactive ants. And with the bite radii, these ants are getting bigger. Giant, angry, radioactive ants. Then why the hell are we sitting in this overpriced RV? Why aren't you doing something about it? We are. We're bringing in a specialist. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] WORTH: Special Agent Corrigan. It's a pleasure to meet you, sir. I'm Major Worth. Kill the yakety-yak, Worth. What do you got? Well, we're not exactly clear, sir. One of the field agents reported that some trees had been delivered into this building. Trees. What kind of trees? WORTH: Palms, I believe, sir. But we think the trees are infested with ants. Ants? That's it. That's why they brought all the way out here for some god damn ants. WORTH: Well, sir-- [SPITS] --they're radioactive. Radioactive? Highly. Now that's more like it, soldier. Show me some ants. I just want to make sure this cable's tied on here, so we can retrieve the rig. Paolo, don't let go of that rope! It's secure. All right, Sam. Good luck. Woo-hoo-hoo! [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] All right, he made it. Pull it back! Pull it back! [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] All right, Sharon, you're going to be next, OK? SHARON: Great. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Ah! [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Oh, my god! Ah! [SCREAMING] Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Ah! [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Did you, uh, bring your key to this place? No. [SHOOTING] Good thing that I brought mine. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] All right, Paolo, you're next. I don't think so. What the hell are you doing? Sorry, pal. I need a head start. I'm next. You're the guy who knocked me out in that office! I'm sorry, I couldn't take a chance. Go back down. Go back down. I'm sorry. I couldn't take a chance. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [GROANING] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Worth, you check out the security area. Buck, back lobby. We'll rendezvous here in 10. Go. Yes, sir. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [GROANING] [SCARY MUSIC PLAYING] [SCREAMING] Oh, shit. [SCARY MUSIC PLAYING] [GUN SHOTS] [SHOOTING] [GASPING] [SCREAMING] [THUD] Oh, my god! That could have been Paolo. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. [SCARY MUSIC PLAYING] [SCREAMING] Get off! Get off! [GUN SHOTS] [SCREAMING] Get off! Get off! [SHOOTING] [SCARY MUSIC PLAYING] [SIGHS] Shit. Gentleman, I believe we got a bug problem. Oh, Agent Lucero. What are you doing slumming down here in the USDA? I thought you'd be back in the FBI, unless maybe you're still, uh. Just give me your report, Corrigan. My report? My report is you've got a building here full of biggest god damn ants I've ever seen. Who's your friend? Ed-- Sheriff Ed Hansen, Pelham County. Well, Ed, you're a long way from Mayberry. What are you doing with the USDA, trying to get some tips on how to manage a beef? Corrigan, just give me your recommendation. I don't have any recommendation. I'm just going to fill this place with enough DDT to flatten Texas. We're going to have ourselves a good, old-fashioned bug barbecue. Oh, my god. Thank god you're here. There are two men still up on the building. Um, one is Curtis. And the other is Paolo. And, um, my boss-- her name is Joan-- she's dead in the building. Oh, what is that sound? [YELPS] [CELLPHONE RINGING] Oh, my god. [GASPING] [CELLPHONE RINGING] Hello? Help me. I can barely hear you. Who is this? It's Carly. Where's my dad? Um, [SIGHS] he's not here right now. This is a friend of his. Where are you? I'm in the garage. And ants-- they killed the security guard. I got away. All right, listen carefully, Carly. Stay where you are. I'm coming to get you. Hurry, please. [ANTS CHIRPING] Oh, god. It's coming! It's coming! Carly? Carly? She's alive. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] I think you have to have a little faith. I know what's appropriate in this situation. Oh, you do? There's a girl in there in the basement. And I think that we need to get her out right away. [INAUDIBLE] Who's in charge here? I am. Well, you obviously know about the ants. We have the situation handled. Thank you. Corrigan. WORTH (OVER HEADSET): We're locked and loaded, sir. Ready for your command. All right, countdown begins in five minutes. Countdown-- well, what do you mean, countdown? Everything's under control. No, you-- you don't understand. There's a girl in the garage. She called me from his cell phone. She's alive. There are people still alive in that building! It's very unfortunate. But I can't afford the risk any more of my people. And we have no more time to wait-- collateral damage. What-- what the hell do you mean, collateral damage? Human lives? Agent Lucero, will you please get all these people out of here? I'm trying to work. Corrigan. Agent Lucero. Listen, I don't like to really court policy, OK? But in a crisis situation, I do have seniority. Is that understood? Let's go. Four minutes to countdown. Evacuate the building, gentleman. There are people still alive in this building! Elizabeth, you can't just let him do this. I have no choice. In a situation like this, he gives all these orders. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Oh, Christ. OK, let's go get that kid. Follow me. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Stand back. OK. [GUN SHOT] That ought to do it. OK. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] SHERIFF: [GRUNTING] Get me a wedge or something. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Hurry. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Your shoes. You're going to be OK in those if we have to run? Well, I'll never get anywhere in life if I can't do everything in heels. [SIGHS] This must be the car. Where could she be? Well, she said she was hiding. Can you call her? Well, she was cutting out before-- still no service. Holy crap, look at that. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [ANTS CHIRPING] Oh, my god. Are those ant eggs? SHERIFF: Elizabeth said the radiation would increase the size, as well as their appetite. [ANTS SLURPING] It looks like it sped up the breeding cycle, as well. In a couple days, this place would be full of them. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Corrigan! Wait! All right, go. Go! What happened to your friends? - They're gone. They went back into the building, I think, to get the girl. - Bad choice. Bad choice. Two minutes to countdown. Well, then stop the countdown. You can't knowingly kill these people. Look, and if I wait, and one of those things gets out and into the city, then what? Look, if you don't stop this, I will. I'll go to the top. Hey. Evan, take Ms. Lucero for a cup of coffee. Let go of me! Get off me! Let's go, guys. Come on. Let go of me! We got one minute to countdown. Let's go. Corrigan! Let's move it. Let's go. Let's go. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] I'm going to see if the power is on. Check for keys in that truck. All right. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Ah, found her. Good. - No keys. - No keys. The power is out. And we are out of here. [ANTS CHIRPING] [SCREAMING] [SCARY MUSIC PLAYING] [SCREAMING] [STRUGGLING] [SCREAMING] [STRUGGLING] [GUN SHOT] [ANTS CHIRPING] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [ANTS CHIRPING] [SCREAMING] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [TIRES SCREECHING] [BREATHING HEAVILY] PAOLO: Ah! [SCREAMING] [STRUGGLING] [ANTS CHIRPING] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] In here. [ANTS CHIRPING] [SCREAMING] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [ANTS CHIRPING] [SHOOTING] [ANTS CHIRPING] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [SHOOTING] [ANTS CHIRPING] There's got to be some way to get all of them. If you think of something, let me know! [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Ladies and gentlemen, to absolute termination. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Start the countdown. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [BEEP] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Two minutes. [BEEPING] [ANTS CHIRPING] [STRUGGLING] [GUN SHOT] When we do, they keep coming. [ANTS CHIRPING] [GRUNTING] Maybe we could hotwire their asses. [ANTS CHIRPING] [SCARY MUSIC PLAYING] Ah! [ANTS CHIRPING] [ANTS FRYING] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [COUGHING] 20, 19-- save those batteries-- 16, 15. Oh I was very worried about you. Help! Help! There are giant ants in the building! Yeah, we've got everything under control, little lady. Just relax. 13. [BEEPING] 9, 8-- heads up-- 7-- oh, the gang's all here-- 6, 5, 4, 3, 2. [BEEPING] [EXPLOSIONS] [ANTS CHIRPING] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Look. [ANT CHIRPING] There's one in every crowd. I'll be back. [ANT SQUISHES] Ah. Cal, Cal, staff photographer. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [CAMERA CLICKING] All right, all right, yeah, yeah, right. It's enough, enough. All right, Cal, bring the car around. ELIZABETH: Congratulations, another job well done. Well, they did have their charm. So, is the crisis really over? Definitely. Am I your boss again? Absolutely. Good. [PUNCHES] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] I always like a woman with a little spunk. I wonder if she's seeing anybody? Yeah, I'm fine, Mom. I need you to come get me, OK? I am fine, OK? I just need you to come and get me. [CRYING] You're probably going to answer a lot of questions. Yeah. Look, I told her her dad died trying to save us. She doesn't have to know any different, you know? OK. Listen, maybe we can get caught up later, and have some coffee or something. POLICEMAN: Excuse me, guys. [INAUDIBLE] Yeah, I'd like that. [SCOFFS] [KISS] [POLICE RADIO CHATTER] [MUSIC PLAYING]
