Where are my elephants? We've been searching for hours... I have not seen one! I'm not going back home empty-handed, Mr. McNabb! There you are, sir. See? Mostly females... Females, not much ivory I'm afraid. Who cares? Let me just shoot. All right. I got you covered. Just take it nice and easy. No! Mr. Bitter. No animal is to be dropped, unless I say so. This is my safari, Mr. Quatermain. I promised you one full grown male. And that is what you will get, sir. Allan. Sir, I am sorry, sir. I did not travel thousands of miles for one measly elephant. - I'll take care of it, sir. - Yeah. What are you doing? I need this job. He's used to getting what he wants. It's not my problem. If we don't make him happy, he just hires another guide! The man is not shooting females and calves when he is with me. With more and more of his kind coming out here, we could be rich. You can be rich, I can be rich. You could take proper care of your son! Don't you dare. We got a contract, McNabb! I'll kill as many of the filthy beasts as I like. You'll get your kill, sir. Not with me, you won't. You go ahead and shoot. No. No! Here, Quatermain. You ok? I'm not. Well, that wasn't a bad haul for the first day, don't you think? No, not bad. Mr. Bitter, a wounded elephant is the most dangerous animal in the bush. This mother she's big, powerful, and she is very smart - she knows exactly who it is who shot her. - Really? Really. Is that true? But she's probably being mauled by a pack of lion or hyena by now. Good... Good. Lot of rubbish. McNabb! Quatermain! Quatermain! Help! Duck! Cut me loose... now! Kajima! Ahh! Oh! Come on. That's right... Sorry, girl. My dearest Elizabeth: At long last, my seemingly endless quest to unlock the mystery of king Solomon's mines is almost over. I must also report, with a certain amount of irony, that... while I am as close to the mines as I have ever been there are outside forces that could prevent me from reaching my goal, momentarily I'm sure. It has come to my attention that my wealthy benefactors and the local Kuakuani tribes are in some sort of competition to plunder the riches of Africa. It has become depressingly apparent that you are the only one I can still trust. I am sending you this map for safekeeping. It is of tremendous value and must be guarded with great care. It is my hope that I can protect you from the dangers that I have encountered. But in the event that you should need protection, I urge you to look up Allan Quatermain. He is a man of great honor. Please keep this map from harm's way and perhaps we can keep the mine safe from those who would tarnish its legend forever. Your loving father. Binto. Take this. Run as fast as you can and stop for no one. Quatermain, Africa shines on you. You should not blame this land for your bad luck. Khiva, I am not blaming Africa for anything. It has nothing to do with it with bad luck. What, with a partner stabbing me in the back, and my... My wife... I have a son in England who I believe needs a father, and it's about time I become one. You do not belong in England. You belong here with us. Yeah. Africa won't be the same without you. Africa is gonna be the same whether I am here or not. Who you are? I am Twala. King of this land and all that you see. Oh. You speak English. I know the language of the white man. But why did you bring me here? Do you have a map that leads to a key? I want that key. I haven't the slightest idea what you're talking about. Kill him. Now... wait. Yes, I... I... I found I found a map and it may have mentioned something about a key. But it's long gone, I sent it across... the great ocean, to my daughter in England. That is unfortunate for you. You will bring it back... Oh... That's impossible. No, Maitland! Nothing is impossible. You will write a letter to your daughter in England. To tell her to bring that map back to us. The czar... of Russia hired me to find that map and he had a great army behind him. I wasn't afraid of him... And I am not afraid to die. I can give pain... far worse than death. Father? Hello, Harry. Father! Oh god, I missed you... Me too. So let me look at you. You're definitely not Little Harry anymore, I guess I'll have to call you "Big Harry", huh? Hello, Charles. Who's here? Hello, Margaret. It's been a long time, Allan. Yes, it has. - You're not going to take him back to Africa. - No no... I'm back... - I'm in London. - No, Allan. Harry's happy here. We're seeking custody. Would you excuse us? Hey... - I love you. - I love you, too. Go. I'll see you soon. Come, dear. Allan, they're filthy rich and they're determined to keep him. You see, it may well be seen in a court of law that you abandoned your son. I did not abandon my son. When his mother died, I sent him to London to be with his grandparents, because I felt it was the best thing for him at the time. You sent him thousands of miles away from you. For his own good! - Yet you chose to remain there. - Austin, I had to make a living. It's a very exciting life you lead, Allan. Big game, hunting, going on safari... Seeing the savage land first-hand, no one really blames you for choosing this above your family. I did not choose Africa over my family. To be perfectly honest, Allan, in my opinion, Harry is far better off with his grandparents. He'll have plenty of money, he'll go to fine schools... Well, I am not interested in your opinion, Austin. I'm his father, he is my blood. You need to tell me whether I have a case or not. Well, you'll have to proof to the court that you are a suitable and responsible parent. What you need is money, Allan, plenty of it... Because they going to fight you tooth and nail. Short of that, I don't see any way that you're going to get your son back. I'm sorry. He's a handsome lad, but has a very strange-looking dog. - It's a warthog. - It's a warthog! Ha ha ha ha! Bartender, another one please. Troubles? Only if you consider being told you're an unfit father trouble. Yeah.. - Good luck, guv. - Thank you. We're obviously in the wrong place. Come, Elizabeth, I don't want you mixing in with this sort. Captain, don't be silly. If he is here, I'm going to find him. Can I help you, ma'am? Yes... We are looking for a gentleman by the name Mr. Allan Quatermain. Here. I'm Allan Quatermain. No. I'm Allan Quatermain. Now see here, my good man, this is a lady you're speaking to. Oh, the American. I think you're looking for the soak at the end of the bar. Are you Mr. Allan Quatermain? My card. This is Captain Good. We are interested in going to Africa. Quite right. Now if you could manage to pull yourself from your libation for a moment... I am sorry. I am not in the safari business anymore. Why don't you and... Count Dracula... Shove off. You'll curb your tongue, sir, or you'll deal with me. Aye aye, Captain! There's a great deal of money in it for you. To do what? To help me find my father. He's been kidnapped in Africa. Africa is no place for a lady. I am not afraid of anything, Mr. Quatermain. Especially when it comes to saving my father's life That complete and utterly loathsome man. What was my father thinking to trust his well-being to an uncouth drunk with absolutely no manners? - And hear most common sense? - What? Well, he makes a point, Elizabeth, about you and Africa. Is it absolutely necessary that you should go? Please don't start again. You know I've made my mind up! If Quatermain won't take us, well then we'll find somebody who will... It can't be that difficult. Good! That you? Praytor! Ha! Bushell. What brings you back to dry land, Captain? Well, um, well this is my dearest niece. Elizabeth Maitland, - Praytor, Bushell. - Ma'am. Charmed. Praytor and Bushell were with me on HMS Hidalgo or was it the Kincardine? It seems you have a great deal of things to catch up with, so I'll see myself back to the hotel. Very well then, but make sure you stick to the main streets. - I shall. Nice to meet you. - So... what are you up to? Oh! Stop! Stop! Give it to me, you little thief! Give me the map, Miss Maitland. - I don't know what you're talking about. - The map from your father. It belongs to us. You all right? Yeah. Thank you. You're welcome. I did not realize, that your father is Samuel Maitland, head of Archeology at Oxford. - That's right. - Tell me what happened to him. I told you. He's been kidnapped. He sent me a letter. Did they say where they might be holding him? Some place in Southern Africa. And I'm prepared to offer you a great deal of money to take me there. Africa is an incredibly dangerous place, quite far removed from the luxuries of home. Elizabeth! Thank God you're back. Is everything all right? Uh, something's happened. Come quickly. - Look at this place. - Yes I know. This was no robbery. The man in the alley. He was not after your purse. He was looking for something else. - You've been attacked? Did... - I'm fine, Captain. I think there's something you're not telling me, miss Maitland. Go on. Before he was kidnapped, my father sent me something. What? I am sure you've heard of King Solomon Mines. King Solomon's Mines do not exist. They are a myth. This map leads to the untold wealth of the ancient Israelites. My father spent the best part of 30 years looking for it. He told me to guard it with my life. May I see it? If I don't take it to Africa, whoever kidnapped him will kill him. - I don't think so. - What? They sell these maps by the wagonful to tourists in Cape Town. Well, you must be mistaken because my father's life depends on me getting that map to an African tribesman, in some place called Sitandra's Kraal. I'm sorry, the mines are a joke, and this map... What is it, Quatermain? All right, I can concede, that Professor Maitland made some unique discovery, but I know that the mines do not exist. I don't care about the mines. I care about my father. Now, will you help me save him? Huh. A squaddle. Good God, do they always live like this? No, thank you, ma'am, no. Quatermain! I knew you would never stay away from Africa long. - It's good to have you back. - Good to be back, though only for short time. I'm visiting. - I'll believe that when I see it. - Ha ha, believe it. - Stay out of trouble! - I will try. - You should run for governor. - Oh, too dangerous. Hey! Quatermain! Sambona. Numza, Quatermain! Sambona, numza. You're an old dog. I knew you'd find another woman. You're wrong, Khiva, she is not my wife. But she is so beautiful... Yes, I know. But, believe me, she is a bit difficult. I could manage that. What are they saying? Uh... weather's been terrible. Miss Elizabeth Maitland, Captain Good, Khiva and Ventvogel. Vee for short. So... I have a job for you, but you look a little busy. - Aahh. - We're ready. You are not gone believe this, but we are looking for the mines again. It is her. - Do you see the map? - Nyet, but she is traveling with others. The old one and Quatermain. You recognize him? Oh yes. So tell me about this Quatermain. He arrived in this country 12 years ago. He showed up at my office fresh off the ship, nothing but a rifle. I took him on for a while, we did well. And then? He brought his wife out to Africa, had a child. And then he got careless. Took his wife on safari. She got mauled by a lioness protecting its cubs. Of course he went crazy, started thinking he been punished for all the killing he'd done. And then he turned on me. What if we have to kill him? Let's just say I won't have him turn on me again. You understand that the map that they carry is the property of the Tsar? I understand you need a guide who knows Africa better than your two friends here from Siberia. You will be our guide for 10% of whatever we find. 25, and don't say 22 and a half. Fine, deal. Ladies and gentlemen, the Bloem Hotel. So, this is it, ha. Seems pleasant enough. Now, Miss Maitland, I trust that you have suitable clothing for a safari. I believe I have suitable clothing for a safari, Mr. Quatermain. After you... Thank you. - And what is this? - Ostrich neck, sir. - Ostrich neck? - You don't like it, boss? Well... "Bon Appetit". What time do we leave tomorrow? Crack of dawn. Quatermain, ya lily-livered pansy. I thought I told you not to show your ugly face around these parts again. Mr. Quatermain, there is a very large, hairy gentleman requesting your attention. Yes, Miss Maitland, I can smell him. Why don't ya just stand up and fight like a man? Or, in your case, as a woman. Would you excuse me. Forgive me. You're gonna fight! Good! That's very good! Try an African tree for a change. Won't you going do something to help him? You can dance all ya like, Quatermain, but you not gon... You Scottish... Captain, stop them! Are we done yet, Henry? 'Cause I don't know about you, but I need a drink. Thank you, Captain. So, this Professor Maitland is being held by a native tribe. Yes, um, he called them the Kuakuani. - Have you ever heard of them? - No, can't say that I have. What would they want with a professor type anyway? Well that's where it gets very interesting. - Professor Maitland.... - I don't think we need to go into that, do you, Mr. Quatermain? Miss Maitland, although Sir Henry may not look like much he is honorable and I would trust this man with my life. Fine. Ah, so ya think it's genuine? Henry... This journey isn't about locating mines and finding riches. It's about saving my father's life. Well, I believe in cold, hard cash, missy. And I believe that I am paying handsomely to help me trade this map for my father. What you do after that is up to you. Good night, gentlemen. You never learn, do ya, Quatermain? What are you talking about? Taking a woman out there... I heard everything. Do you have the money? They are leaving tomorrow. Where to? Sitandra's Kraal. They are to meet a native and give him a map. What are you reading? The mystery of king Solomon's treasures. King Solomon's Mines are a part of ancient history. Like Captain Kidd's treasure, or Atlantis. - Right, Quatermain? - Something like that. Don't let him fool ya. Quatermain believes in the mines. - He even tried to find 'em once. - Really? - I was a kid. - Ha! - You were almost 30! - It was years ago, and I never found one shred of evidence to proves that the mines exist. Aye, but a good story. Still a good story. Why don't you tell us about it, Miss Maitland? - Why not? It'll pass the time. - Aye well, according to the Biblical account, King Solomon ruled Judea for 40 years. He was supposedly a very wise king, who united the lands around Jerusalem into a single country. And he built one temple to the one God of the Hebrews, it was to rival all the grand palaces of Mesopotamia and Egypt. So he sent his men to the far corners of the world. And they found a place where it was said the ancestors of the ancients buried a huge treasure trove of riches of every kind. Diamonds, gold, emeralds, rubies. This place was called Ophir. And on their return, these riches were used to adorn King Solomon's temple and nothing in the world rivaled it. However, it is said, that only a small amount of what the men found in Ophir was actually used in this temple. And the rest is yet to be found. Would you care to have some, boss? Well, it depends. What are you eating? Mmm. An African delicacy. You know, more like your caviar. - Caviar, eh? - Yeah. Well, then I'll, uh, give it a try. It's not bad. What do you call it? Mopani worms. Worms? Absolutely beautiful. The Savannah, Miss Maitland. Truly beautiful, is it not? Yes. So let me take a look. Ah! Honestly, Mr. Quatermain! How does your wife tolerate your uncivilized behavior? Put this on. It just might help. His wife's dead, Miss Maitland. It happened a long time ago. And, for your information, I think she liked his... uncivilized behavior. What are you doing? Determining whether you shall live or die. She is reading your daughter's thoughts. Seeing her journey. If Gagool sees your daughter coming, then you shall live. If not... What do you see, Gagool? The vision is blurred. It seems that your daughter has failed you. Wait, I see something. She travels with three white men to Sitandra's Kraal. Good news. Your daughter brings the map. You shall live... for now. You know, I don't understand you, Twala, what you want with the mines? You have no need for their riches. It is not riches that I crave. Ah... You crave power. The stone of the ancestors. But why? I mean, you are the king of this land, of all these people. It is not enough! It is not enough!! My father was banished from this place and sent to the land of the white man. I was raised amongst you. I know who you are. And I know the best way to defeat you. Hey! Look at you. Come here. - Boss! - Khiva, Vee! Miss Maitland, stop! Do not touch those cubs! They're all on their own. If we leave them here, they'll die. Then so be it. Let go of me! Listen to me. Their mother is either dead, or right behind that bush waiting to come down on you like one of those antelope. Is this really necessary, Quatermain? Captain Good... This is not your London high society, where all you have at stake is your reputation. Out here... it is your life that's at stake! - All clear, Quatermain. - Thank you, Henry. It's late... we need to find a safe place to camp. All right. I've never seen so many stars. It's really beautiful out here. The Savannah is seductive that way. - Khiva. - Numza. We'll take turns at the fire tonight. I'll take the first watch. Ok, good night, my friend. Why do we need the fire in this heat, eh? It keeps the predators away, captain. Oh! Oh, I see. Well if you, uh, need me, just call. Good night. I'm beginning to see why my father loves Africa so much. It's breathtaking. That it is. You mean to say we actually agree on something? I suppose so. Just look at this. Thank you... for coming on this journey with me. It's getting late. We got a lot of ground to cover tomorrow. All right. Good night, Mr. Quatermain. Good night, Miss Maitland. Believe me, she's a lot more frightened of you than you are of her. I sincerely doubt it. Are you all right? All clear, Quatermain. Nicely done, Henry. When you find a proper cat, you let me know. Good morning! Looks like a lovely day! Did you sleep well, Elizabeth? Eh? Mm? Henry, what's for breakfast? - So how are you holding up? - Just fine, Mr. Quatermain. How much further to Sitandra's Kraal? About, uh, three hours, if we're lucky. That's our man. Your safety is my responsibility, there has to be another way. My father's letter was very specific. I have to make the change by myself. I'm afraid she's right, Captain. But for Elizabeth to go alone... We will be right behind her the whole way. Now if you see anything suspicious at all, you yell as loud as you can and you run for cover. You hear? Now, listen. You be very, very careful. Now go Vee, behind those rocks. Khiva, right flank behind those bushes. Give map. No... not until I see my father. Give me map! Not until you show me my father! Put the map down, Miss Maitland. Back away. Quatermain. - What? - We've got a problem. I think this is our man, and he's dead. Elizabeth! Run! Cover me! Miss Maitland! Elizabeth! Get on, Miss Maitland! Come on. Come on. Sergei! I'm hit! Elizabeth! Are you all right? Sounded like Russians... and they knew about the map. Russians? What the hell are Russians doing here? I'm fine. Elizabeth, uh, you must tell them. Tell them what? For the last few years, my father's pursuit of King Solomon's Mines has been financed by Tsar of Russia. I suppose they think the map belongs to him. I didn't think he would be an issue! My God. Petre is wounded! Where were you? You were supposed to cover us! I was not hired to kill for your precious Russia. You had the shot on Quatermain I know you had the shot. I'm a tracker. I track, that's what I do. You want to kill Quatermain, you go ahead. That's your department, not mine. You’re a coward, McNabb. You signed with us. You made that choice! Live with it. Because, after today... your friend Quatermain wouldn't hesitate to kill you! He's headed further inland. The tribes on the other side of those mountains are not always so friendly. We stay on his trail, and let him do the work. Everything is going to be fine. Fine how? What are we going to do now? - Henry! - No. I know what you thinking, Quatermain, but you can just forget about it! Right now, please! It's time to visit an old friend. - No! - Yes. Ah! Mooma Tuussee. Sir Henry. How long has it been? It don't think we should be talking to a witch doctor. We have no choice. Your father is a teacher. A professor, actually. Sir Henry... I think you've something for me that might help. A necklace. He was a Kuakuanis. Very loyal to their king. A man named Twala. Twala holds your father. You have a map. Let me see it. Follow the map. Get the key. What key? The key to King Solomon's Mines. You will find the key in the tomb of the righteous. In the sands of the great desert. Follow the path to Sheba’s eye, through her breasts and into the valley of the Kuakuanis. The mine is there. And Twala... will be waiting. And my father? He too, by the grace of the ancestors. Go. Travel quickly. There isn't much time. What just happened in there... and who is this Twala? I don't know. But the stakes just went way up. Wait here a minute. Who are you and what do you want? I am Umbopa. You are headed north. I was born in the north. I haven't been home for a long time... I will go with you. I thank you... but we don't need another bearer I require no payam. I can be of great assistance. Just the same, I don't need any more men. I know this land very well, and I've crossed the great desert before. Khiva is chief bearer, he'll tell you what to do. All right, everyone, listen up. We are now moving into uncharted territory, where few have gone and even fewer have returned... So if there is anyone at all who wants to turn back, I suggest to do it now. There is no shame. We'll all go with you. Of course not, Quatermain. We have no option. Why do you think African tribes would be interested in King Solomon's Mines? They have no use gold, jewels, or stuff like that. It's a good question. I think it's the stone. What are you two talking about? What stone? Legend tells that King Solomon's Mines contain an ancient relic. The Stone of the Ancestors. Do you think this is why they holding my father? They do say that the one who holds the stone rules all of Africa. Let's move out. Do you see them? All right... this is where we dump the horses. We let them go now, they have some chance to get back to Sitandra's alive. What do you mean, we're leaving the horses? We are being followed, Captain. - So, Henry. - Aye, Quatermain. You, Vee, and Khiva, put together only what we absolutely need for the trip, and get the rest together to Boobath. Captain, if you could help, please? We're going out there on foot? Miss Maitland... you should go back with the horses. Momma Tuussee can arrange safe passage to Cape Town for you. - What about my father? - I will find your father. Look, I need to apologize. I should have told you about the Russians. The truth is... You haven't done that bad. I also think... that your father would be very proud of you. I hope so. I need to see this through. I'm staying. The horses are ready, boss... and so am I. All right. - Khiva, you stay with me. - Yeah. Vee, I need you to take three bearers, I need you to scramble the area. You take two horses east, two horses south. And we're gonna confuse the hell out of these guys. Then swing back around and we'll meet up tonight at Cascamba River. All right. And be there. I certainly hope you know what you've gotten yourself into. I do. There goes our transportation. Everybody take your shoes off. We need them following the horses, not us. They were just a here few hours ago at the most. Over here. Tracks. They went this way. No, wait. More tracks here. Two sets of tracks. What now? Which way, McNabb? Stop wasting time, McNabb! Which way? Quatermain released the horses. Those tracks are a ruse. They went this way... on foot. How do you know? I see no boot prints. Bare feet made those tracks. Believe me, I know the way Quatermain thinks. - Let me help you, boss. - Nonsense. I can carry my fair share. Are you sure this is my fair share? It's truly amazing, to be out walking in a place that hasn't changed for thousands of years. Most people only see bleakness in the desert. I can't believe it's taken me this long to get here. Why didn't you ever ask your father if you could to join him? I did... all the time. But, like you, he thought that... His fragile daughter would be best left at home. It was far too dangerous for me to go. You don't say much, do ya? This is ridiculous. Quatermain, it's been a long day. - Why don't we make camp? - We're trying to remain invisible, Captain. This is way too out in the open. We wait for vee, get water, and we're gone. Someone is coming. Sambona, Vee! - Ah. Sorry, boss. - So what happened? I led them several miles, but I don't think they followed. It seems our Russian friends have a tracker. Maybe we should get moving. Well what's the difference if we make camp? They know that we're here. At least, we will be rested. This is an excellent idea, Captain. Khiva, take the bearers, erect the tents, gather wood build a fire. Yeah, boss. - So you've finally come to your senses. - Something like that They are still asleep. This is the chance. Don't take him for a fool. He knows we are following him. He already made sure of that. The map is the property of Mother Russia. I take my orders directly from the Tsar, not from you. I thought we agreed to let Quatermain take the risk of a spear he get from a native. - We simply follow. - No... we take the map now. I want as few people as possible getting to those mines. Your impatience, my friend, already got this man shot. And your procrastination is a weakness. Colonel, they were never here. Ivan... We do it my way now? I pray facing towards home each morning. It gives me strength. So, how long has it been since you been there? I was forced to leave when I was just a small child. So... you just decided to go back? The gods have foretold, they have given me you. Me? I don't understand... We'll be shown the way. You must have faith. I don't think the gods concern themselves too much for me. The gods know you very well, Quatermain. The gods smile upon you. And they know your destiny, even if you do not. - What were you two talking about? - Nothing. I'm just still try to figure him out. Did you? Actually no. I think he's sad. The kind of sadness that keeps him from sharing his life with others. In many ways, he's just like you. Doesn't quite fit in, but he doesn't know what to do about it either. Is that right? Yes... it is. You wanted to see me? I hear you saw the white man Maitland without me. Why? I had to feel it again to see his daughter more clearly. So what? Did you see more clearly? Oh yes, I feel that she is still on the way to us. What is it, Gagool? A white man accompanies her. You should fear this man. Why? That I do not know. But he will be an obstacle for your desire. So I have to kill him. Of course, soon you get what you want, my king. I hope so, for your sake, Gagool. Yes. Nice watch, boss. Thank you. So is your necklace. Do you want to trade for it? My dear Khiva, this watch was given to me by Her Majesty on my retirement, it's very special. Oh, this is, too. Very well... it's a deal. This is beautiful. What does it stand for? I don't know. I bought it in a souvenir shop in Cape Town. Uh, Khiva... How far do you think it is before we get to this tomb? It's hard to say. - What do you think the cobra represents? - A marker... Hopefully, the entrance to the mines. I don't understand. A cobra? It's either... an actual monument, a geological rock formation, or... it could be a warning. A warning of what? I don’t know, but we'll find out. These tracks are fresh... they're no more than an hour ahead. Good. How much further, you say? Quatermain! Look! I'll be damned. So this is the cobra's head, but there's not much else. ...what the hell we're lookin' for? We should have ridden those horses until they dropped dead. The vultures would have given us away. Bloody idiot. McNabb! I think maybe you don't want us to catch up. I think maybe you are with Quatermain. Go ahead... And when the wind comes up and blows these tracks away, the three of you can wander around in this desert together lost, until the vultures come and peck out eyeballs. Go on, they're hungry. Don't ever point a gun at me again. - For the Ancestors, you know. - To you, sir Henry, who had the foresight to pack a necessity beyond all necessities. Whiskey. - Aye, the same right back at ya, Admiral. - Captain. - Congratulations. You've just been promoted. - I'll drink to that. I can't just stand around here doing nothing, looking at rocks. We have to do something. This book explains why King Solomon hid the key in a mine in the middle of a desert. It does? What does it say? It turns out... That King Solomon was building such an incredibly ornate temple, because he had fallen in love with a certain queen. The Queen of Sheba. So when Sheba traveled to Jerusalem to meet Solomon, they fell in love, completely. Passionately. Yet Sheba’s people did not approve. She was, after all, an African queen. And they were so different, they were from such different places. One steeped in the culture and tradition of Africa... And the other one not. So when she went back to Africa, Solomon would not give up, he was so in love... That he sealed the mines, and offered the key to Sheba in exchange for her becoming his wife. Actually tried to bribe her. The man was so desperate that he sent righteous men to wait for their reply and they waited for years but Sheba could not bear to leave her people. So Solomon sealed the key in a tomb forever. What happened to Solomon and Sheba? They never saw each other again. Sad. It is. I wonder what it's like... To feel so passionate about someone you're willing to sacrifice everything. I put my father's life in your hands. Miss Maitland? You all right? I think so. - Elizabeth! - What the hell? Elizabeth! Are you all right? I think I found it. Been here a long time. - For the Ancestors? - Aye. Help me. No key. Quatermain! Come and look here. Henry, no! Don't touch it. Don't touch anything. Elizabeth? Elizabeth? Don't scream. Captain... wake up. Wake up! Captain! Oh! Wah... ahh... okay. Where is Elizabeth? It was the Russians. - The Russians? - Yeah. - And there was another man. - What man? Dark haired, dressed like you. A hunter. McNabb. Tracks head west. If we hurry, we can catch them. Load up everyone! This is not a good idea. Why the hell not? We're low on water. If we go out hunting them now, we have no idea how long we're gonna be out there. Umbopa says the water's that way. We have to find her. You have the map and the key to the mines. If you ask me, it's not us that's gonna be lookin' for them, it's them that's gonna be lookin' for us! Well I did not ask you, Henry! Vee, Khiva, let's move! You are not thinking, Allan! Violence will solve nothing! We must make the girl our first priority! But we won't save her if we die of thirst. The only water in this part of the desert it is the oasis at Queen Sheba’s eye. Like all creatures, we must go there to drink, and so must the men who got Miss Maitland. Let's move out! Tell me again, Miss Maitland. I don't know anything. You're wasting your time. The map that your father sent you belongs to the Tsar. We want it back. Well, I haven't got it. So I suppose you're out of luck. Then so are you. Wait. Just wait. You gave Quatermain the map, didn't you? What if I did? We were partners once, he and I. You can't trust him. You can say what you want... And you can treat me how you like. Quatermain is never going to give you the key. There is a key? We find Quatermain. We offer him a deal. The map and the key for her life. - What if he won't do it? - Oh, didn't you hear them? Quatermain is a honorable man. And he's a sucker for a beautiful face. He will trade you for the wealth of King Solomon's mines, won't he, my lady? Let's circle back, gentlemen. They'll find us. And when they do, we'll get Miss Maitland back again. I hope you're right, Henry. How far do you think to Sheba’s eye? I certainly hope you know where you're going, because frankly, I'm lost. You won't find your way with that. It's a large desert. Don't worry, we'll find Miss Maitland. You must have faith in the ancestors. Faith? You know, for a wise man, you put a lot of faith in these ancestors. For a wise man, you don't put enough. Let's keep moving. Do you pray, professor? I do. You speak English. I speak anything that you need to hear. I'm here to warn you. You must pray to your God. Pray for your daughter. What are you talking about? There are men who want what Twala wants. They say it belongs to them. - They have taken your daughter. - What? And if they don't bring her back, they will take the mines. And if they take the mines... Why you telling me this? Why aren't you telling Twala? Because I sense great change for our people, but only if she survives. Your daughter's destiny is not written. There is much spirit about her. I know. Pray that she survives. Or you will never get out of here alive. Never. How far ahead are they? An hour... two at the most. I don't think you man is going to make it. We must leave him here. Give him some water. Why? Dead men don't drink. Why do you follow him? You ever hear of march of death? Two years ago, the Tsar ordered 150 of his men to march all the way across Russia. From St. Petersburg to Vladivostok. Just for fun. It was middle of winter. Suicide, and they knew it. But they went. Only one man made it. And it was him. Don't waste your bullets. Miss Maitland, you got any water? - I think you should come back. - I'd rather die! If you die, so does your father. Come on. We've got to keep moving. Just keep moving. One foot in front the other, Captain. Look at the captain. - You've got to keep moving. - We need to keep moving. You gotta keep moving, Captain. Get up, Captain. I can't go on now. - If you stay here, you die. - Let me die! Captain... A man of the sea like yourself does not want to do die in the desert. Aye. You'll insult the water. You boys... fight rough. Water? I smell... water. I smell water. - Where are you going? - Here we go again. - Captain! - Don't waste your energy. Crazy English fool, you've found us water! Water! They were just here. The sand's still wet. The tracks lead away. They've gone. - I don't like it. - What can they do? We have her. Sergei... Drop your weapons, gentlemen. We're all around you! - I said drop your weapons and let her go. - Wait. Listen to me very carefully, Mr. Quatermain. Before I count to ten, you and your men will walk down to us, very slowly. With your weapons raised above your head. If you don't, I will shoot Miss Maitland. Are we understood? The count begins now: One... two... Don't play games with him, Quatermain, he means what he says. Three. Four. Five. Just give us the map and the key, and we let Miss Maitland go. Six. Seven. - Eight... - All right. I'm coming down. - We're all coming down. - Don't do it! I trust that an officer of the Tsar... is a man of his word. We are soldiers, Mr. Quatermain, not murderers. Now drop your weapons. I said drop your weapons! I will give you whatever you want, but I will not drop my weapon. - Then I will kill her. - It seems that you are in a tough spot, sir. One trigger pull... you will never see the key nor the mines. For that matter, you will be dead. And you lose your lady-friend. Why don't ya just shoot me? And let friend Ventvogel blow you to pieces while ya reload! I want the map, and I want the key. Anything you say, sir. Take it! Now, I'm sure you'll understand, Mr. Quatermain, we need some distance. Let's move. Don't do anything stupid, miss Maitland. - Elizabeth! - Ah! - Aahh! - Run! You all right? Vee has been hurt! It's just my leg, boss. It's just my leg. Your daughter lives, and continues her journey to our land. All this just not make you happy? Yeah, I am happy that she is alive. But I’m... I'm not happy that she is come here to save me. I should never have let her put her live at risk. You are right to worry about her. Twala is an unpredictable man. It is very dangerous that she come here. What kind of a father am I, to put my own daughter in such jeopardy? A better question is: What kind of father are you... That your daughter would risk her life to save you? Thank you. You should never have traded the key for me. If I hadn't you be dead now. He is quite right, Elizabeth. These men are barbarians. They'll stop at nothing to get to the mines. I like to get hold of that McNabb, and take the map back. He is well gone. So the next landmark on the map... is the Breasts of Sheba. What do you suppose they are? There they are. The Queen of Sheba’s breasts, I believe. Having never met the woman, of course. Right. Now all we have to do is find McNabb. So you say you know these mountains? Then you take the lead. Don't look so worried, McNabb. Quatermain has no idea where we are. This is... Sheba’s Smile. We walk through here down to Sheba’s Breasts. - Sheba's Smile. - It's not her smile I'm worried about. It's her teeth. We're ahead of them now. Come to papa. We'll set up in these rocks. Watch your step. Khiva, high ground, left. Captain Good, here. Vee, you stay with me. Now, Miss Maitland, if thing go south and I have to move, you stay right here. - You stay put, you understand? - Yeah. Okay. What now? Take cover. Right now. McNabb, drop the bag and move off! All right, take it easy! Just take it easy. McNabb. Drop the bag, McNabb, and move off! Cover Quatermain. Boss? I'll get the bag! Khiva, no! No! Where do ya think you're going? Khiva, get down! No! Cover me, Henry! Come on! Elizabeth! Take your shot, McNabb. Now! Jam! Ah! Aaahhh! Let me see. Let me see. - You'll be fine. - Quatermain. You're gonna be fine, Khiva, you're gonna be fine. It's fine... No, no, don't you die on me. Khiva. Gods of the earth, sun, and the stars, take our brother and make from his body a great tree. Let it be a reflection, of what Khiva's life was on this earth. Umbagasha, Khiva. May I join you? Sure I couldn't sleep. I kept thinking about Khiva. Me too. When I was a little girl, my mother died. I was so confused, and frightened. Right after her funeral my father came to my room to comfort me. He told me that my mother's spirit would be always with us. To prove his point he picked me up and, carried me outside and we lay on the ground and looked at the stars, and, he pointed to one, and he said: Every time, god closes the door on life... He opens a window into heaven. To let the light shine down forever. That's lovely. It helped. - What is it, Quatermain? - Umbopa's gone. No tracks, sign, nothing... just disappeared. What do you think? I don't know. Maybe he just went home. I'll make a fire, make some coffee. Come on, wake up. Give me the knife. We're partners now, you and me. I'll do it. It is not about the money, McNabb. It was never about the money. I want the stone of the ancestors. You don't believe a stone has any real power. I am here for the Tsar. He believes that the tribes of Africa believe it as power. That is enough. Bite on this. And hold still! There she comes. There she comes. - What is it, Quatermain? - Shh. Don't move. You don't suppose they're cannibals, do you? - What do they want? - I don't know. Maybe this is the tribe holding my father. Well, things just go from bad to worse, don't they? Gonna get a lot worse for you, McNabb. Just a hit, I will release him from suffering. We take care of the killing here. - I'll save ya the trouble! - Henry! My people, Kuakuanis, look at me closely. I am Ignosi. Your rightful king. What is he saying? Umbopa says he's the king. Umbopa's a king? M'lenge. Don't you remember me? When I was a little boy... My mother and me, we left our home. How can I believe you? A mother is said to have walked with her boy across the great sea of sand? Yes. I have come back to claim my throne. Twala killed my father and robbed me of my birthright. There is only one way you can prove that you are your father's son. This is proof which you are asking for. Ingosi. Hmph. Why are you protecting these whites? They are my guardians and servants. And these two... Are my slaves. What did he say? He says this lot are his bodyguards, you and I are his slaves. - I am nobody's slave. - What is this, some kind of a joke? Bow down. The Kuakuanis will kill any intruder to our land. If you want to live, you must do as I say. Drop down. Ignosi, our king is returned. This is perfect. They will lead us right there. Where do you think they're taking us to? You're going to meet the man who killed Umbopa's father. - Twala? - Aye, seems like that. I am sorry for not telling you about my birthright sooner. Well, why didn't you? I was not sure if you would come with me to this place, knowing the task I would have to perform. Whoa, wait... So... you planned this all along? The gods have foretold that you would help me to be king. In exchange I will help you to survive this place. Where does my father come into this? M'lenge has told me that Twala holds a white man prisoner. If he is still alive, when I am king, he will be free. What if you don't become king? Quatermain, may I have the key? What are you doing? This key is the only thing I have to help my father. The key is all I have to win my birthright and defeat Twala. Twala is a cruel king, Miss Maitland. He kills people and steals their land. If you give him to the key, he'll find the stone of the ancestors. And the stone will give him the power to talk to the gods. And if that happens, there will be no stopping him. I think we can trust him, Elizabeth. We find ourselves here under the power of the sun... To celebrate the power of the Kuakuanis. There you see the white man. Full of lies and deceit. This man... lied against your king. This is not a good time for a sacrifice. He did not bring what he has promised. The Ancestors tell me... that the key will be brought to us soon. Have patience, my king. The time of patience is over. Kill him. Who dares... to disturb this celebration? Elizabeth! Father! Let go of me! Who dares to disturb this celebration? I am Ignosi, the rightful king. You are a deceiver. Kill them! There is no reason for violence. My father was Cohadi, your king. Twala killed him. My mother fled with me into the desert. Now I am back home. You say you are the king. Who can confirm this? I remember his father and I know, Ignosi is our king. An old man. I have thousands of warriors which say that I am king. Gagool! You know the will of the ancestors. Maybe you have... The key, Umbopa. Give Twala the key. The daughter of the white man has brought the key. I give Gagool the key to keep... Until we have decided who becomes king. And you let free the white man. I claim the throne from you. I request Nomolos! The fight of life and death! You may choose one man to fight for you. I will choose one of my slaves to fight for me. Who is left alive at the end, his master shall be king. Where is Elizabeth? She's preparing the food with the other servants. - What do they want with us? - Your heads on a stake. You know at this stage I really don't care if they do put my head on a stake. Just so long as it sits right beside yours. Hand me your weapons. That means you too, soldier. Everyone up. - That white man, Quatermain... he is the one? - Yes. - Give it to me. - What is that, my king? Give me the key to the mine - if your warrior wins Nomolos... - I want it. Ahhh.... My king, it would be wise not test my magic. - Let's have a look at you. - You are making a big mistake. All right... I agree. If I had my way, I'd string ya's both up by the neck. But Umbopa is a compassionate man, right. Now, you have a good night sleep. Of course, I hope the mosquitoes bite a million holes in ya. If yer hungry, you can just bite each other's noses off. Shove off. Right. I feel so ashamed. Father, you have nothing to be ashamed of. I should never written that letter. But I was afraid, Elizabeth. I was so afraid. I know, I understand. See, I-I thought it would... buy me time. Give me a chance to escape. I should never have sent it. If you hadn't sent it, I wouldn't be here now, would I? ...and I put you, and those men who helped you, into such danger. Hello, sir. It's really good to see you. I cannot thank you enough, Allan. Is everything all right? Twala has chosen his warrior to fight for him. And what about Umbopa? Who is going to fight for him? Now is the time... For Nomolos. A battle to the death. Only one of them will survive... And his master will be king. This is not your fight. I am going to give you one more chance to walk away. Take all the whites and leave. I won't harm you. And Umbopa, what about him? I'll deal with Umbopa in my own way. And I will fight as agreed. Then you are a fool. Take your weapon... and fight my warrior as agreed. Or I will kill you myself. Cut me down. Cut me down. Kill the white devil! Kill the white devil! Kill the white devil! That's it, Quatermain. Do it. Do it! Henry? Henry, no! No, no, no. It's too late. - Don't die. - Enough. For the West Wail course. It's the way I always dreamed it would be. No, no, Henry. Tell Umbopa that he'll be a noble king. And you take good care of the lass. Don't... please, please don't die. No, no, no, no, Henry! Quatermain... no. Stop. Stop! No. No! Trust me. I've got it. - Look away. - What? Don't look at her. I'm not a savage. I am not afraid of your magic. I am an officer of the Tsar. I will hold your look... as long as I want. You do not intimi... Breathe once. Again. Now stop breathing. Look at me. Look... at... me. Your friend sought the stone of the ancestors. You do not. Why? I do not seek power over the African people. But you seek wealth... which in the end gives you power. Does it not? - You are wise. - You flatter me. The white man who fights for Ignosi... you cannot trust him. You envy him. So long as you envy him, you must follow him. Go. Your journey does not end here. - Will I find what I seek? - Yes. But you can never possess it. A toast... To Sir Henry. To Henry. The wildest, bravest, most irreverent crazy of old fool that ever lived. And my friend. I am here to serve you, my king if you will have me. I must tell you, Ingosi. That while I was held by Twala... This woman was the only person to show me any compassion. You may sit with us. I know you've done much for me, my friend. But I have one final favor to ask. What would that be? As long as men are interested in the power of the Stone of the Ancestors... My people will not be safe. It must be destroyed. - You want me to destroy the stone? - It was foretold. - The ancestors. - You have a strong voice within you. Listen. Trust. You will find what you seek. Here we go. Well, I can go no further. I understand. Watch your step. I'll be damned. After all this time. King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba. Here. Stay behind me. Don't move. Now we're gonna go... for a nice little walk. That's it. One step at a time. This way. Forward. So what are we gonna do, shoot each other? You got the key, the mines are yours. But that is not what you want, is it? You want a piece of me. It's what this is all about, isn't it? So here's your chance. So what, McNabb? What you gonna do, shoot me with my own gun? Come on. Come on. I'll be damned. This speaks of the Stone of the Ancestors. And King Solomon's desire to unite the tribes of the world into one kingdom. This one speaks of his love for the Queen of Sheba. You ready? Wait, wait, wait. - Let's not get ahead of ourselves. - Ok. After you. There's gotta be something. Well, there it is. The Stone of the Ancestors. No no no! No. Take it slow. There's only one way to find out. I should have known. You're not much of a talker, are you? Actually, I like to talk. Marie and I used to... talk about hopes and dreams, and the farm. We would talk all night long about nothing. That's the first time I heard you mention her name. Oh, I don't know, I did... I am sorry. If you don't want to talk about anything, and you prefer to just sit here, that's fine too. It's nice to have someone to talk to. Actually I've... thinking that, uh... If you know, we got out of here that, uh... I might ask you about if you... Wanted to be with me. Because... I do not want everything to go away... And never feel again the way it feels when I'm with you. So I was, uh... thinking that, uh... If I had... asked you to marry me... What might you have said? I might say yes. Really? Really. Will you... marry... me? Yes. I will. My God, I so wanna kiss you. Kiss me. This is so much better than talking. I wish I could make it official. Like... I wish I had a ring or something. I know the queen of Sheba has a ring. - The ring... - It's worth a try. Hurry, hurry, get up there. Get rid of the stone. Throw it. Now go. Watch your head. Keep going. Well, you don't have to worry. I won't hold you to what you said down there. Come here. How about if I hold you for the rest your born days? That would be nice. - Tea is outside, Mr. Q. - Thank you, Mrs. B. - Hey, Papa. - Harry, so how is the roping going? - Wanna see? - Absolutely. Don't you think Vee has had enough fun for one day? It's ok, Mrs. Quatermain. He couldn't catch me even if he tried. Come on, let me see what you can do.
