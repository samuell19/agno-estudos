Angelina! ♪ We can run, we can run ♪ ♪ We can run, we can run ♪ ♪ We can run, we can run ♪ ♪ We can run, we can run ♪ Angelina! Flawless as always. Our spacing was completely off. And that pose at the end still isn't strong enough. Always the perfectionist. So, what do we got? Press junket's up next. - Be nice. - Always. - Let me introduce you to... - Angelina Costa. Madison Sparks, Celeb Buzzpop News. It is, like, a total honor to meet you. I have been a fan since I was a baby. A baby? Really? The industry has changed a lot since your first single. Like how your labelmate Cheri Bibi utilized Twitter to put momentum behind her latest single. Yeah. She certainly is very innovative. Totes. Well, do you find it difficult to stay on top of current trends? I'm just wondering if it's difficult to stay relevant. For example, recently, you put out a TikTok that felt a little... ...outdated. Is there pressure to keep up with these younger artists? Esta idiota. What was that? Oh. I love your shoes. Oh. She asked about the TikTok, Mo. The TikTok! I mean, she... She pretty much told me that I should retire to my face. Who cares what she thinks? You have a shoot to be on the cover of Fashion Beat magazine tomorrow. That's what you need to be focused on. - Right. Yeah. - All right. Okay. Yeah. - Oh. - Yes. Right. It's Barry. Mmm. Mmm, don't get it. But he's the head of the label. I have to take it. Well, Mo, just tell him I'm not here. - I don't know. Make something up. - Okay. Barry! Hi. Hey, Monique. I was hoping I can catch a moment with Angie. You know, you just missed her. She's off to a fitting for tomorrow's shoot. Great, great. I had a thought. Ange should make a Christmas song. Christmas songs are good for business. - No, no, no. - Christmas is a few weeks away, Barry. And I'm not sure that a Christmas song really fits Angelina's whole thing. What? Look what it did for Mariah. That one song alone can buy her a private island. Don't you worry. We've been working on some new material, and I think she has a hit. Okay. So when can I hear something? You can hear it on Sunday at the gala. Okay. All right, well, just make sure she delivers. Yeah? - Of course. Of course. Okay. Bye. - No! No! Why'd you tell him we have a song? We don't have a song. I've literally been rehearsing my hits. Mo, I have not been feeling inspired, and I don't... I mean, I don't really think that a Christmas song is my style. And... it's not like the record label's gonna drop me because I don't want a "Jingle Bell Rock." Are you serious? Wait. Are you telling me that Barry gets a shiny new toy, and he would kick this to the curb? Well, that shiny new toy has a top-ten single right now. My advice? Shoot. Stop rehashing your old hits. Get in touch with your inner Holly Jolly, and write a new hit single that he can release this Christmas. Mommy? Could we turn the telenovela down, please? No way! Ricardo just got up from the dead! Yeah, that's more important. Cristina! Sweetheart, can you please turn it off? Between your music and your grandmother blaring the TV, I can barely hear myself think. Anyways, can you please play the guitar on my video? - No. - Aw, please? No. Please? I'll frame you out. You won't even be in it. Okay? You better. Yes! I miss you, Ma. Tsk, oh... ♪ No matter where you go ♪ ♪ I'll always keep you with me ♪ ♪ And I know ♪ ♪ Your love is here to stay ♪ ♪ I'll always keep you with me ♪ ♪ And I'll always ♪ ♪ Have a place in my heart ♪ ♪ Where you stay ♪ That song was by Angelina Costa. Who... Well, who doesn't know who she is. My mom and I used to listen to that song a lot together. Um... My mom passed away a few years ago. Um, I'm gonna use it in my quinceañera next week, so it feels like she's there. My Christmas birthday wish is to one day meet Angelina. Maybe take a selfie with her. And tell her how much her song means to me. Ah, there she is! Smile for the camera, mi amor. Ricardo! What a surprise. Uh, well, hey there, everyone. I plan on having some new music for you very soon. Oh. Well, what about a little bit of, uh... inspiration? Oh. Pues por supuesto. Okay. Mmm. - Merry Christmas to me. - Oh. Okay. - We have it? - What're you doing here? Baby, what? I can't resist this. You know, the behind-the-scenes content always lights people up. No, no, no. Stop. Stop. No, we agreed. Baby, we got 15 million followers that are hungry for content. Plus, we need some extra footage to promote the gala. No, the gala? That's not what the event is about. It's about the charity, not us. I'm on your side, okay? - Right? - Yeah. - Ricalina. - Mm-hmm. - Ha ha! It's good for both of us. - Right. - Yes? - Yes. - Yes? - Yes! Yeah. Ricalina. - That's a yes. That's a yes. That's a yes. - Okay. See you later, Mo. - Catch up with you. - Yep. Bye. What? I thought Ricalina was going public with the breakup. We can't. We can't! He's right. Not yet. We got to get our numbers up. We have 15 million. We need 200. We got to get those Beyoncé numbers. Whatever. - Dad, where's my phone? - Where did you leave it? Mijo, if she knew where she left it, it wouldn't be lost. Ooh, what are you making? Pozole! Mmm, it smells so good. Here it is. Yay! It's dead. Oh. It's a Christmas miracle. Come on, we're gonna be late. Love you, Mama. - Adiós. - Bye, Abuela! ♪ I got that energy, yuh ♪ ♪ Ain't never stopping it, yuh ♪ ♪ I got that energy, yuh ♪ ♪ I know you wanna get, yuh, yuh ♪ ♪ I got that energy... ♪ Girl! That outfit is fire. I mean, I knew it was gonna look good, but seeing it on you? - You are working it. - Thank you. Yeah, I am feeling it. You should. I was actually going to order lunch. You want anything? Oh, absolutely not. With the performance coming up, I got to stay strict. You wanna talk about it? Uh, yeah, sure. I plan on doing a lettuce diet up until the gala. Hold on. What is a lettuce diet? It's when you only eat lettuce. But you alternate by day the kind of lettuce you eat. It's much more exciting than it sounds. - Mo? - Huh? The transition from arugula to spring mix makes your whole week. Okay, no more distractions, deflections, excuse me, or arugula. Venga. Sit down. Come on. Talk to me. My head is just not in it, Mo. Okay, I'm not feeling it. I... I mean, you know I haven't felt Christmas since... - Well, you know, Ma passed. - I know. And now they want me to write a Christmas song. Seriously? Ho ho ho, deck the halls. No, it's not happening. Okay, let's go. You look beautiful. - We have to make this tighter. - No... We... I don't... - Wait, do I have muffin top? - I'm not even answering that. - I can pinch. I'm pinching. - You're not pinching. Please. - Angie. - Barry. - What are you doing here? - Hey. I figured I'd come by and chat with you in person. Is this about the song? 'Cause I've actually been working on the song, and it's coming along great. I would absolutely love to discuss the song. But first, Cheri! You've met Cheri Bibi before, yes? We haven't had the pleasure. Oh my gosh. It is wild to meet you. Likewise. And look at your outfit. I don't think I could ever pull off anything so vintage. Mmm. You... Why... Why don't you talk to the photographers and let Angie and I finish up? Oh, of course. So wonderful to meet you. I cannot wait to hear the new single. You a star, girl! Mmm. - Isn't she something? - Yeah, yeah, yeah, she sure is. What did you mean by go talk to the photographer? You and I need to talk about some shifts. Shifts? It feels like the focus is in your past, and the label really wants to project an image of the future. I don't understand. What? Fashion Beat agreed to make Cheri the cover instead. What? Wait. - Are you serious? - Yeah. She's just more relevant right now. - Barry, you can't do this. - It's already done. You look great, by the way. Hey, Monique. Grab your stuff. We're leaving. - We'll be at your place in 20. - No. I don't want to go to my place. I just wanna get out here, out of the city. - What do you mean, out of the city? - Just anywhere but here, Mo. Okay, I'm not sure you're thinking clearly. So let me... Let's just go. Where do you want the driver to take us? Just tell him to take the day off. I'll drive. Okay, okay. - Thank you. Honey. - You're welcome. You haven't driven anywhere by yourself in over a decade. Okay, fine. You'll drive. Okay. So remind me again. We're going where exactly? I don't know, Mo. Okay, I don't know. Okay. Not that I don't love driving aimlessly when we have a deadline to finish a new song, but the gala is in a few days. This is not exactly the time to be impulsive. I just... I need to get away from all this to come back stronger. Okay, Mo? Just... please, just give me this. Please. That's it. What? This is where we're gonna go, Mo. What are talk... What? What are you talking about? - Okay, this girl. - Okay. Last night, I saw this video she posted where she covered one of my songs. Mo, her singing and her tribute were so beautiful. And in the video, she said that she really wished she could meet Angelina. So, let's go grant her Christmas wish. Why? Since when do we do house calls for fans? It's good business, Mo. Meeting a fan and granting her Christmas wish. I mean, come on. I really need this. I really need to connect with my fans right now. I mean, at least they still think I'm relevant. Say I go along with this. - You will. - I might not. How do we even find this girl? What do you mean? She geotagged her pic and hashtagged her high school. She's just a couple hours away. Ugh. Social media creeps me out. Whatever. - Hey, Cristina. - Hey. Hi, Uncle. See you in music class. And don't be late, and keep practicing. Everything okay? Yeah, it just needs to charge a little more. Not with the phone. I meant with you. You know, there's still time to make changes if you want. Dad, it's my party. I should be the one stressing. Ah, you only turn 15 once. I just want you to have an amazing day. Dad, you're doing great. Hi. You know, if you want a plus-one... No. Okay. I know. I'll make you a Bumble 'cause you're definitely way too old for Tinder. Absolutely not. You don't have that app on your phone, do you? No. - Oh! - What? What is it? Our video only got 20 views. Good. Those videos should just be for you and your friends. What, you thought Angelina might see it? Well, yeah. Sometimes she likes and shares her fans' edits and posts them on her story. It's actually pretty nice of her. Angelina? Hey, is she on that Bumble? Dad. Uh-uh. No. Uh-uh. Where are the people? Seriously? Stupid ex? He's probably just planning some Insta post. However will he get through without them? Oh, okay. So I think that's it. Well, at least this outfit will get photographed. ♪ Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow ♪ ♪ All my kitties say ♪ ♪ Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow ♪ ♪ All my dogs say Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow ♪ ♪ All my kitties say ♪ ♪ Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow ♪ ♪ La gata ♪ Ask him. No. Hey, Scott. So, like, Cristina has her quinceañera coming up. There will be food and dancing, and you should totally come. So, like, a 15th birthday thing. - Yeah. - Mm-hmm. Dope. Cristina and Miguel Torres to the principal's office. - What did you do? - Nothing. What did you do? Nothing. Ah! Wonderful, you're here. I didn't wanna keep them waiting too long. - Keep who waiting? What's going on, Tom? - Your daughter has a visitor. Oh. Oh. Oh my God! I... I... I can't believe you're here! - I can't believe it either. - Wh... what is this all about? Th... that's my dad. Oh right, Ms. Costa, this is Miguel. He's our music teacher. Oh! Music teacher. Well, Cristina's chops must run in the family then. Did you see the video? I did. And I loved it. - You did?! - You did?! Mm-hmm. Especially the part about your mother. I added some stuff. You know, it reminded me of what I felt like when I first wrote that song. So, I wanted to do something for you. You mentioned in the video you wanted to take a selfie, right? - Mm-hmm. - Well, let's get you a selfie. - Are you happy with them? - Mm-hmm. Okay. Well, we should get on the road. We don't wanna get stuck, especially since you're on a deadline. Oh, you... you don't want to drive in this. Or at least wait until the snowplows clear the streets. Well, since you're stuck here, why don't we have dinner at my house? Cristina! - We'd love to. - We would? Mm-hmm. Are you crazy? We gotta get back. We can't go anywhere until the roads are clear, Mo. Your ability to put off this song is almost admirable. My dad's an amazing cook. He's really good. Dad, please! Please! I made plenty of pozole. Mm-mm. Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm. No. Not happening. Mm-mm. No. Uh, can I use these? Ooh, ooh. What are you doing? Uh, what do you mean, what am I doing? These are designer heels, Mo. Okay, I got them during Fashion Week in Milan. Mm-hmm. They are not, and I repeat, not meant to experience the elements. I need a picture of this so I can leak it to the press. Don't you dare. Don't you dare. Too good. Okay. Wait, you're supposed to be my support. Okay. He's right there. We're fine. Yes. Hi, sweetie. - Thank you. - All right. - They're Yves Saint Laurent. - Mm-hmm. Custom. Yeah. So cute. Hi. It's so cute. - Mmm. - Oh. Welcome to our home. Can I take your coat? Oh no. - Take the bags off. - Oh. All right. Angelina! Can I show you my quince dress ideas? Uh, yeah, yeah, sure. Oh. Okay. Wine? Dear God, yes. Thank you. These are my... ...quince dress ideas. I was thinking about the rose gold, but I don't know. What do you think? This one? Solid choice. Who is this young man? Oh, just a guy from science class. - Just a friend, huh? - Tsk, I guess. Gloria's always trying to get me to talk to him, but I'm like, what if he doesn't like me? But what if he does like you? I know, scary, right? But I'm the worst person to be giving advice about this romantic stuff. Just ask any of my exes. Yeah, but aren't you dating Ricardo Mondraga? It seems you'd be the perfect person to give advice on this kind of stuff. Mm-hmm. Is this your mom? That was my mom. - You wanna see a picture of my mom? - Yes. This is my mom. She's so pretty. Thank you. She, um... She passed a few years back. During this time. Uh, do you wanna sit down? Oh. You can sit down. It's okay. - Go ahead, sit down. - Oh. Okay. Oh! Things just have not been the same since I lost her. My mom. She would have loved it here. Oh, with all the lights and the snow... She loved Christmas so much. It's crazy, you know, I'll catch myself. I'll get really excited to tell her about my day, and then I'll remember that she's gone. I know that exact feeling. There's so much I wanna share with her. Like my quince, for example. It's supposed to be this big moment on my way to becoming a woman. And it feels strange. Just not to have her there to see it. Well, I'm sure she would have been very proud of you. And lucky for you, you've got your dad. Yeah, he's... He's pretty great. I'm home. That storm casi me mata. I would've been back sooner, but Conchi and Connie. Ay, Dios mío, those tías can talk. ¿Quiénes son estas? Mama, these are my friends. And the weather's too bad to drive home. They're gonna sleep over. Okay? Claro, mijo. - Abuela, this is Angelina. - Hola, señora. And this is Monique. This is my mom. Welcome to our home! Ay, bienvenida. Gracias. Yo soy Frida. - Oh! - Frida! - Oh! Oh. Oh. Okay. - ¡Bienvenida! You hungry? - Uh... - Yes, we... Okay. Let's eat! And we're live in the studio with Angelina, que me fascina. It's good. Es que... Where is she? No, no, no, no, no, no, no. - Wow! - Oh, this is... So you don't get cold! - Oh. - Oh. Gracias. Gracias, señora. Wow. Wow. Wow. This looks so delicious. I have not had a home-cooked meal in forever. - Really? - Yeah, that's true. I have all her favorite restaurants on speed dial. Mmm. Oh, uh, thank you. I'm sure it's delicious, but I'm just gonna, uh, stick with some beans. - Huh? - I have to fit in my dress for this thing. You're just gonna eat beans? Yeah, I mean, it's protein. Don't get me started. It's a necessary evil of showbiz. That's why you're so skinny. You need some fat to be healthy. - Go on, Miguel. Dale pozole. - Oh no. Gracias, señora. Estoy bien. Dale, okey, ¿cómo que no? Dale. Okay, Just un poquitito. Just a little. - Un poquitito nomás. - Okay, that's good. Thank you. Sí, ahora aprovecha. Okay. Estoy comiendo. Oh my God! It's so good! Well, if you ever get tired of eating just beans, my kitchen's always open. I'll make sure you have my number. - Does Ricardo cook? - Who? Uh, her boyfriend, Ricardo Mondraga. You're dating Ricardo Mondraga? No way! You're too skinny for him. He's on the show Grandma watches. Usted... You watch Reina del Mar? That's all I watch. Yeah. She never misses her telenovela. She may love your boyfriend more than you do. The one that takes his shirt off in every scene? - Yeah. - That's the one. I would like to make a toast to the chef. - To the chef. - To the chef! And this is our music room. Oh! So are these real, or are all these just for show? Oh, these are all his instruments, and he composes too. He even had a band. Cristina. It was a garage band in high school, and it never left the garage. A band, huh? Yeah, I had the hair and everything. Oh, I gotta see that. You know, I always admired those hair metal guys. The only boys I know who used more hairspray than I do. - What's this? - Oh, that's nothing. Well, it's not nothing. It's just not... done. They say home is where the heart is. They... They say... ♪ They say home is where the heart is ♪ ♪ They say home is where the heart is ♪ That's actually pretty good. But, I mean, this is just the verse. Where's the... Where's the hook? Well, you know, I'm... I'm... I'm still working on it. Working on getting the band back together? No, it's just for fun. I haven't written for fun in a really long time. I think I can hear it. They say home... What do you... Wait, look, let's try it. - They say home is... - What, are you serious? Yeah, I'm serious. Come on. Live a little. ♪ They say home is where the heart is ♪ Then you repeat it... ...and it lands here. That's really good. Yeah. So they say... So, yeah, you know, what if you just adjusted it a little bit? Then you go... ...and then you go down there. - That's... That's a lot better. - Yeah? Yeah. Yeah? Oh, I am so sorry. I'm writing on your stuff. No, no, no, no. It's okay. It's good. It's good. - You sure? - Yeah. Yeah. Okay, so then we would go down here, right? Yeah, you know, and it's not just the notes and the chords. It's... it's the message. It's really sweet. Home is where the heart is. It really could use some finesse and some retooling. But the message has a lot of heart and... I could help you with this if... I mean, if you're looking for a cowriter. I... Uh, well... What? Why me? I'm just a music teacher. So what? A... A good song is a good song. And the DNA for something really special is on that page, and... and I can really feel it. O... okay, but yeah... ...wouldn't you rather work with a professional? Good music comes from the inside, and I really feel like together we can write a great song. - Yeah, I just don't... - Okay, I'm gonna level with you right now. I need this. I need a brand-new song, Miguel. I need a brand-new Christmas song. Okay, there. It's... It's out there. I owe my label a new track, and I've been coming up completely blank. And I really feel that this could be it. I mean, you saw how seamlessly we played it together inside. - I think that we could do this. - Okay? Say we do this. How... how does it even work? Easy. We agree up front that it's a mutual split, strictly business deal, and I get my single. You, nice chunk of change that you can put towards Cristina's college as well as royalties if the song is a hit. It would be kind of nice. Oh, also, you can finally get the band out of the garage. I don't even know what to say. Just say yes. Yes. So easy. So, deal? Deal. Miguel, Miguel. Vente, vente. Vente, vente. ¡Okey, ya, vete! Give me a chance to get to know our guests. Dile, Cristina! We women need some space to chitchat. All right, don't worry. You're gonna be okay. Just... don't let her drink after midnight. - Dad! Seriously? Why would you say that? - I made a deal. Who wants a shot? He's kind of cute, you know. Mo, don't even start with that. I am here for the song and only the song. I just hope the song is good enough. Miguel? Oh. Oh jeez. Oh no. Oh yes. What? Grandma broke out the Christmas tequila. Ay, Dios mío. She is a hoot, that lady. Here. Take this. I haven't touched it yet, and you're gonna need that way more than I do. Thank you. Ah, that is so good. I hope it helps. And I'm so sorry. Oh, don't be sorry. It... It was actually kind of fun. Where are you guys off to? - Oh, we're headed to my quince rehearsal. - Oh, cool. Uh, hey, so I wanted to tell you. I worked on the song some more last night. - Really? Me too. What'd you do? - What'd you do? Oh, I can play it for you real quick if you want... - It's the... - I... Well, no. We... We will be back in a bit, but you are more than welcome to go inside, stay warm, use the piano, and we'll be right back. Or we could go back to the city. Sure. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you probably have to go... anywhere... celebrities go. Miguel, I need the song ASAP. I can't just stay here when we're both clearly vibing on song. I mean, we're... We're... What if we miss a crucial moment of inspiration? I... We're flowing. I can't... Uh... Okay. Yeah, you know what? I'll just come with you. Yeah. I'll just come with you, and we can work at the rehearsal. What? You... you wanna come? I mean, unless you don't want me to. I... I don't want to overstep. Well, no, no, no. Of course, I'd... Of course, we want you to. I mean, you're more than welcome. It's just, you're probably used to events of a certain caliber and style, and we're a little more... Miguel, I'm a recording artist. I'm not a space alien. But, you know, let me just clean up a little bit. So, we're going to a quince rehearsal now? Quince time. Oh my gosh! I'm freaking out! Speaking of freaking out, I have no idea how your tías are gonna react to this. I said don't freak out. Clearly it runs in the family. It's her mother's side. This is Connie and Conchi. Cristina's tías. And they're helping Cristina with her quince. - Hello. - I love you. Oh! - Thank you. - I love you more! Oh. Is this because of the video you did? I know! You should do a video for Beyoncé next. I actually know Beyoncé. You do?! Okay, guys, let's stretch it out. Okay, so can I show you some of the lyrics I thought of last night? Wow! Okay. So... Ah, here we go. What do you think about this? I don't want Christmas just to be another day. Is that good? Is that too much? No, no, no, no, no. I love it. Wh... what... what about this? May I? Oh yeah. Of course. Come on. Come on. Come on. 'Cause there can be no Christmas without you. Yes! - Yes! That is it! That's perfect. - Take it from the top. Five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. And one, two, three, four... This... this is crazy. I must have listened to your Love It or Leave It album a thousand times in the car, the break room, at the gym. Wait, Love It or Leave It? That album was, like, forever ago. What about Slingshot? That one was a little... ...dancy for... for my taste. Dancy? - Huh. - Oh, but that first album? Oh yeah. That... That one was... That one was magic. And now I'm sitting here with the person who made it. I'm just like anybody else. No. I'm just like... ...anybody else. Yeah, well... I never had a quince. Feels like I missed out. What were you doing when you were 15? Touring with J.Lo. Oh... oh yeah, yeah. You were really deprived. Sorry. And one, two, three, four, and five and six and seven and eight. Cristina, would you like to show Angelina your baile sorpresa? - What? - Okay. Yeah, I would love to see it. Okay. - Okay. - Okay. Hit it, Tía! Oh, that's my song. Five, six, seven, eight. And one, two, three... No, stop, stop! - That's not it. That's not it. - Oh. Ugh. - We're struggling a little bit, but we... - Okay. I... I... I know... I know what's tripping you guys up. I... Everyone back to one. - Oh my God! - Okay. - Oh my gosh, you guys. - Okay. What's tripping you up is the signature change after the intro. Okay? But if you had a little choreography, you can recover your timing. So let's do something, like, we'll go... One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Okay? - And... - Okay... Oh, um... Let's not do that. Okay, let's just keep it simple. Um, we'll go and one and two and three and four and five and six and seven and eight. Okay, ready? Can we try it? Five, six, seven, eight. And one and two and three and four. Now let's give it full commitment. Okay, I want to see face. I want to see performance. Five, six, seven, eight. And one and two and three... So, have you decided on a chambelane for your quince yet? You can always ask Scott, but you def need a date. I'm not putting myself through that humiliation again. Besides, I think I'm going to go as an independent woman. I mean, isn't that what this is all about anyways? Bold! - Then we can go into the verse here. - Hey, Angelina! Um, I was wondering... You're probably really busy and all 'cause it's close to Christmas, but would you wanna come to my... ...you know? Your quince? Next Saturday as my VIP. I would love to. But only if you do me the honor of coming as my guest first. What do you mean? There's this annual fundraiser I do every year in the city at Christmas, and I would actually love for you both to come as my VIPs. - Let's go! Let's go! - I don't know what to say. Just say yes. I guess I have to. Yes! Great. Okay, well, let's go finish this song. Or otherwise no one's going to any gala. Oh gosh, I mean, you know, it was in the playbook possibly. So, but now I will reconsider. Oh... Exactly. Oh, um, I should take this. Yeah. Oh, what do I do? Barry! Where the hell are you? I... I'm working on the Christmas song just like you asked me to. That's what you're supposed to be doing here! Well, I just needed some time to figure it out. It's the creative process, Barry. It's... Okay, all right. So you do know the gala is right around the corner, right? That... you know, that right there. That is an excellent point. So I guess I shouldn't be wasting my time on the phone then. Bye. Nobody hangs up on Billion Dollar Barry. I hang up on people! Miguel, ready to get started? The tamalada waits for no one. We could use your help with these. Mom. Maybe it'll inspire you. - Sit. - Food always inspires me. Oh, uh... Muchísimas gracias, señora. But we have so much work to do. I mean, we have barely... Huh? But yeah, sometimes you find inspiration when you're not looking for it. Exactamente. Exactamente. Ah! Uh... Hmm. Uh... Can I give you a hand with that? Oh, uh... Yeah, I... I suppose. - Let's just start from the beginning. - Okay. - All right. Turn it this way. - Oh. We're just gonna take some of that out. Do I push down on that too? - No. - Oh. - Then you... Just like this. - Okay. You're gonna have to get 'em dirty. There you go. - So, do I put it all over the thing? - No. - No, just half of it. - Just like about here to here. - Oh. - Okay. That's good. You're doing it. You're doing it. ♪ Can't wait to see what Santa brings ♪ ♪ What Santa bring for me ♪ ♪ And I can't wait to celebrate ♪ ♪ Celebrate with everybody ♪ Now, remember, next time, less masa, less mess. You wouldn't know where I can find a certain pop star, would you? Ah... Have you seen this? - What the hell? - Uh-huh. Who is Conchi Cutie? Yeah.

We don't even have clean clothes. Connie and Conchi are on it. All right. Now, that is a good look. Why, thank you. But, uh, just wait. This is the... ...real show. Who needs a club? The club right here. Well, I'm gonna go see what Frida's up to. Okay. So, uh, where were we? - Chorus. - Ugh, yes, that line in the chorus. What is that line in the chorus? Uh, okay so... ...after that. I've never written with anyone else before. Get out of here. All those albums? Not even once? No. I mean, I've done other people's songs, but all of my stuff, I've written completely alone. Yeah, I've never written with anyone else either. It's too... It's too... - Too intimate. - Yeah. I... I... I think there needs to be a resolve here. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You're right. You're right. - And the bridge still isn't working. - Ugh. I know. I know! What do we do with that bridge? Wh... what do you do in the studio when you can't crack it? I leave. What, you just run away? No, although that's an excellent idea. I mean, I... I just leave the studio. I do my best work at home. You can see the entire city from my place. Ah, it's so great. All those lights just really inspire me. Come on. We're going. Grab your coat. We're leaving. Wha...? We're working. Well? It's not Manhattan, but... Oh! I love it. Miguel, oh, thank you so much. I should be the one thanking you. You were a real hit today. You earned some die-hard fans. Although, apparently, I already had one die-hard fan who has listened to my record a thousand times. You... you're just not gonna let me live that one down. Not in a thousand years. Seriously though, you make Cristina very happy. Oh, I can't take credit for that. Not when she's got an amazing dad. Well, I do my best. Sometimes I wonder if it's enough. Never doubt yourself, especially when it comes to that. You are a great dad. You really are. You know, you... You must be doing something right. I mean, Cristina is such an amazing kid. And the way she loves you, aw, it's the sweetest. I could say the same for you though. You got the kind of career most people could only dream of. Yeah. Hmm. Although, I guess, sometimes it could get lonely. Sometimes. But this... This really is so perfect. I know what you mean. I've tried to hide this love inside. - What? - I've tried to hide this love inside. That is the line in the chorus that we have been missing. ♪ I've tried to hide this love inside ♪ And then... ♪ 'Cause there can be No Christmas without you ♪ Ah! We did it! Oh! See? Who needs Manhattan? Let's go make some music. Let's do it. Oh jeez! I can't... Ugh. Ugh. Hey, baby. Miss me? Uh... Ricardo. What are you doing here? How did you even find us? Some lady posted a photo of you on Instagram. Her name is Conchi. Baby. Ah, you know, we have a big night ahead of us. I just thought I would come to make sure that we make it back to the city in time. - Huh. - What? Who's that? Ricardo! You're alive. Hey! Hey, gracias. Muy bien. Muy bien. Okay, honey. I... I... I think, um, we've had enough now with our visit with the fans. Come on, let's go. Let's go. Ricardo, you know, not that this is any of your business, but we have actually been collaborating on a song. Wait, you two have been writing a song... together? Yeah. Well, I mean, it was really Miguel's song, but yeah, we have been writing a song together, and... and it's actually... It's actually been a wonderful collaboration. Oh, uh... ...well, I'd... I'd love to hear it. - We just cracked it. - It's not done. You can hear it when it's ready to be heard. No pressure. Yeah, no pressure. Yeah. It... it's just Angelina, she's... she's... She's such a dynamic stage presence that I guess I just assumed she'd be collaborating with somebody who could match that stardom. Class. Stop it. Basta. See you outside, mi amor. I, um... I'll go grab my stuff. I'm so sorry about Ricardo. Even on a good day, he can be a lot. It's just another element to an already really, really strange couple of days. Well, it's not over yet. I... I'll see you two at the gala. I wouldn't miss it. Bye. Ricardo, por favor. Angelina. It hurts us. That's all I'm saying. It hurts us, or it hurts the brand, Ricardo? ¿Y sabes qué? Por la quinta vez, we were just working together. And that's not what it looked like! And that's the only thing that matters. - Do you like this guy? - No. I was only there for the song. And, sabes qué, you of all people should know that I do not get involved. Yeah. Yeah. No. I, um... I remember. Ricardo. We tried. Maybe we didn't try hard enough. No. Seriously, Ange, if you don't wanna do this anymore, just tell me because... No, no, no. No, no, no. Mira. This is... This is working for me. Okay, Ricardo? This is working. You're right. The brand, it's important. Okay. See you at the gala. I'll get it! Hi, guys. Ready? - Um... - Um... H... hi. I'm gonna get you to the theater. Come on. - Oh, no, no, no. We're not ready yet. - Come as you are. We got you. Okay! - There she is! - Whoo! Angelina! ...one of the most anticipated performances tonight will include pop superstar Angelina Costa. What?! Pick an outfit. - Wow. - Right? Where's your dad? Ugh, still getting ready. Mm-hmm. Men. Sheesh. - Let's go. - Mm-hmm. - Wait. Wait. - Stunning. What? Angie. Barry. You've been so secretive these last few days. I can't wait to hear this new song. Oh. You remember Cheri? - Hi! - Of course. Oh. Okay. - It's so good to see you again. - Mm-hmm. I just quickly wanted to say, you are such an inspiration to me. - Really? - Yes! I watched the Love It or Leave It tour three times. It really gives me inspiration for my shows. You watched it three times? Okay, five. Okay, ten. Wow. That's... that's very sweet. Cheri's playing Saturday Night Live's Christmas special this week. I don't have to tell you how big of a deal that is for a career. Cheri, that is wonderful. And I wish you the absolute best. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm on in just a few minutes. Can't wait. - That didn't look fun. - It wasn't actually that bad. - You had that fake smile thing going. - What do you mean? Stop. There you go. That's better. When do you perform? - In just a few minutes. - Do you get nervous? No. - I still get excited though. - I... I can't even imagine. I haven't performed in so long. I don't even play in front of my students. Aw, that's a shame. People should get a chance to hear you play. No. I can't do what you do. Hey. Break a leg. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you. You all have been absolutely wonderful. So we have one last song for you tonight. It's a very special song. It's a new song. And in fact, the person I wrote it with is here tonight. - That's you! That's you! - Stop, stop, stop. Miguel Torres, will you join me on stage, please? Oh! Yes! Go! Go! Go! Aw, come on, audience. Let's help him out. - Miguel! Miguel! - Miguel! - Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! - Miguel! Miguel! Can we get a spot on Miguel, please? Dad. Yeah! You got... Dad, you got this! Go! You've got this. Yes, thank you so much, everyone. You're in for a real treat. You got this. Miguel Torres, everyone! What are you doing? Getting the band out of the garage. It's just you and me up here, okay?

Oh! Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. You got a standing ovation. And, I mean, you were... you were... You were amazing. - God, look at my hands. - Oh my God. I never felt anything like that in my whole life. - I can't believe you did that! - I can't believe I did that either! Angelina. Angelina. You did it. You did it! - We did it, baby. - Oh! Oh! Guys, wait until you hear this new song. It's gonna blow your minds. This has the potential to be a massive hit. Even this late in the season. This could easily break the Holiday 100. - People are going nuts over this new song. - Come on. It's okay. Come on. Let me talk to you. Hey, listen, listen. I want you to do the SNL special this Saturday. - Wait. What? - Yeah. But wait, what about Cheri? You can't do that to her. It's already done. Let's celebrate. Come on. Come on. Ange. Ange, where are you going? Ange. Hey! Could I, um... Could I talk to your dad for a minute? Come on, kiddo. Hey. So, um, I wanted to tell you that, uh, they want me to play the song on SNL next weekend. Our song. - Get out of here! No way! - Yes way! And... And I want you to come with me. What? To Saturday Night Live? Yes! I could use a good pianist. A pianist? Yes, of course, a pianist. Are you kidding? You were absolutely incredible on that stage. I wish I could, but I... I just can't. Why not? I already have plans this Saturday. Oh. Right. Yes, of course. Uh, Cristina's quince. I was supposed to come. She'll understand. Well, what about after the quince? The song is gonna have a life, Miguel. And... And we can work in the studio. We can write more. We can tour together. - How fun would that be? - Tour? Angelina, I just can't up and leave. Okay, I have a daughter. I have a real life. What is that supposed to mean? These last few days, with everything that's happened, it was just about the song for you? Nothing else? I... I... Yes. Yes. Yes. Okay? Th... this is... this is how I survive. I throw myself into the music. What good is surviving if you're not really living? Just having an image isn't actually having a life. You gotta take risks. Miguel, uh, look. This whole thing was just business. Okay, we agreed on that from the beginning. We agreed. I spent years of my life missing out on what you gave me in one night because I was too scared to take a risk. I never thought I'd let anyone in again ever... ...and then here you come. It was never about the song for me. It was you. It was always you. And I think you feel the same way. I can't. You can't, or you won't?

Look, I don't wanna make any commentaries. I don't wanna say anything out of school. Just... just... just to clarify, though, I broke up with her. Okay. She did not break up with me. So we're all on the same page, okay? I never liked him anyway. Desgraciado. I bet all those muscles are probably fake too. Oh no. They are very real. I feel like this is all my fault. What are you talking about? If I hadn't made that video, none of this would have happened. That video and your passion made a superstar come into our house. And she fixed your baile sorpresa. - Mmm. - And I wrote a song with her. And I got to perform it onstage in front of a packed house at a fancy theater. It was horrible. That's not what I meant, and you know it. I saw the look on your face backstage. - You have a crush on her. - Oh yeah? What do you know about crushes? Dad, it's about to be my quinceañera. You know, that whole thing about becoming a woman. I'm not a kid anymore. I know about crushes. And I... I just thought she liked you too. - It's complicated. - Complicated? When Ricardo Santoval thought that Ruby was dead for five years, he married her sister, only to discover that Ruby was alive but paralyzed and loca, living under an assumed identity in Oaxaca. That was complicated. What's in your heart is simple. You just need to follow it. Now, cállense! My show's starting. So, I talked to Fashion Beat. They want you for the spring cover. That's great. Oh no. Did Barry change his mind again? No, I'm here as a fan and to say that, uh, there's no hard feelings. I know how it goes. You know, for the record, it doesn't have to be that way. There is enough room for both of us, Cheri. And... Look, I don't really know you, but you seem really sweet. I don't wanna be pitted against you. I wanna cheer you on. I wanna celebrate your wins. I wanna cheer you on too. Well, thank you so much for being here. Where is that guy? Your boyfriend? Oh, uh, Ricardo. That's... That's over. Oh, bummer. He played a mean piano. Oh, Miguel. Yeah, he... he was never my boyfriend. - Oh, could have fooled me. - Could have fooled all of us. Well, that's sad because you two are pretty magical together. She ain't wrong. My favorite musician once wrote that home is where the heart is, so... You know what? I gotta go. You go. I'll handle it. Okay. Uh, wait, wait, wait! Um, what's happening? It looks like you're performing tonight, after all. Break a leg. Two more minutes. Coming through, guys. Ah, thank you. You ready? I learn so much from you every day. And you shine brighter than I could have ever imagined. I'm so proud of you, mija. And I'm proud to be your dad. And your mom would be so proud of you too.
