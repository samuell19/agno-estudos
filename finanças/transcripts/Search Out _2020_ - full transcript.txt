The truth is meaningful when... The truth is meaningful when you know it, and it is a value that must be revealed. But the truth can sometimes hurt someone or even make someone unhappy. They're a bunch of jerks! Can't we just kick them out? They're insane. They should be isolated! The first mission. Watch the following movies over one night. The third mission. Don't communicate with others for 24 hours. The fifth mission. Hurt yourself. The last mission. SEARCH OUT TOEIC Vocabulary Bible Resume Today's wish: Help Gyeong-won move Thank you for your help. I was worried about having to do it all by myself. Don't mention it. It's my pleasure. This is not much, but I'd like to pay for your meal. No, thank you. Please take it. You're doing a good job. I just want to help you. I see. Thank you for this anyway. I'll use it meaningfully when I help others later. Sure. Let's take a picture together. Since I am active on social media, I'm reluctant to reveal my face. According to your physiognomy, you won't be a civil servant. But I have to be a civil servant. What should I do, then? What do you want to do? I told you I want to be a police officer. My dream is to be a police officer. Don't say it's impossible. Please tell me how. How to pass the exam. Why do you keep saying it's impossible? I helped Gyeong-won move. Mission complete! Hope he'll enjoy his stay at his new home. #Genie #MovingHelper How can I help you? A pack of Dunhill cigarettes, please. Your ID, please. I didn't bring it with me. Aren't you a student? That looks like a school uniform. Goddammit. What? You shouldn't speak that way to an adult! Give me the name of your school. You're not my teacher. Don't give me a lecture. And you're an adult? Adults don't work part-time at convenience stores. What? Why do you keep glaring at me? - Hey! - What? - What are you doing here? - What? Get out of here. - Why are you doing this to me? - Have a nice day. Don't you glare at me like that! Kids today are so spoiled. That's the way they are. It reminds me of my good old days. You mean how you used to be the bomb back then? I did... No, never mind. I was just immature back then. Seong-min. You're still immature. Hey! Have you heard of Scissor Hands of Bongam-dong? Even a slight touch of my hand would tear you up. That's why they called me Scissor Hands. The rumor must have not reached Seoul yet. No, I've never heard of it. Aren't you pretending you didn't hear it? Sir, how are you today? - Is everything okay? - Sure. What brings you here at this time? I just stopped by. Hey, delivery boy! Why aren't you saying hello? Hello, sir. Is that a free meal? I paid for this. Oh, yeah? Sir, I'm old enough. Please don't hit my head. He should've given me a talisman to carry. I'm worried I might really fail the exam. He didn't say that, so don't worry too much. He basically implied it! Good evening. Good to see you. How is your studying going? As usual. Oh, as usual? If it's as usual, you'll end up like this guy. Then I'd better go and study now. Sure. I think she took a puff. - Without a doubt. - Stop your nonsense. How's your studying going? Hey, I don't study. Do you know why? I'm just good at working in the field. I'm not the type to study with books, you know. To put it bluntly, the police only need to knock criminals down. Why do we need to study Korean, English, and math? Why the police of all jobs? It's highly competitive these days. Good question! Strong people like me have to protect the weak to make the world a better place. I must bring justice to this world. I must do what's right. Don't speak nonsense. I don't know! I must pass the exam first so that I can bring justice and do what's right. It's driving me nuts. Heard back from any companies? I know myself well enough. No company will need me. I'll try one more time this year. Since you're Genie during daytime, you must not have time to study. You're such a social media addict. Frankly, it's a bit hard. But I don't know. I don't know what else to do if I don't do that. Anyway, this is just between you and me. Please don't tell anyone. About what? That I'm Genie. You're Genie? What are you talking about? I'm showing you how good I am at keeping a secret. Barometric pressure. Barometric... Barometric, my butt. Seo Min-ji Ereshkigal: What does your life mean? What? I'm training hard to achieve my dream. What the hell? Your dream is nothing more than an illusion to hide the vanity of life. Don't you want to know the real meaning of your life? Please get a monitor for me. I want to make a wish, too. Hi, Noryangjin Genie, I just opened my shop... Noryangjin Genie, please help me settle in Korea. 147 followers 725 followers 2,497 followers Park Seo-won, psychiatrist New Life Psychiatric Clinic Career counselor. PhD in criminal psychology Hello. I'm Noryangjin Genie. Let me know the time and place. I'll send you a text after checking my schedule. Free Career Counseling for Young Job Seekers Hello. How can I help you? Would you like to get counseling? Oh, no. I got your request to help you promote this. Oh, right. We offer free counseling services to people with a low income, job seekers, and young people with the help of the Welfare Service. I see. We're doing it for a good cause, so I hope more people could benefit from this. Why don't you try getting counseling? It's free. No, thank you. I should get going now. I'm a bit busy. I took a nice photo, and I'll post the promotional article later today. What's up, bro? Hey. Are you worried about something? Tell me everything. No. Seong-min. Remember the girl we saw on the rooftop last time? Who? She said hello to you. Oh, her! I barely know her. We only say hi to each other. Anyway, why? Actually, she made a wish on me. Yo, dope! What a coincidence! She lives in the same building! What did she say? What's her wish? It can't be... Absolutely not! It's like... She wants to talk about her worries. What did you say? You only accept requests from those with lots of followers. What a hypocrite. Aside from that... It just felt icky. The fact that I'm Genie might become known, you know. Why are you trying to hide the fact you're doing good deeds? Seong-min. At least in this field, I'm pretty... Still... Well... How can I reveal myself in this situation? I'm only a job seeker. Hey, but as an adult, you should grant her wish and listen to her troubles. You're so heartless. I am so sorry. Unfortunately, I won't be able to grant your wish because I have too many requests. Guest House Sorry. I'm so sorry! How could he flat-out ignore me? That was close. What's up, bro? Hey, what happened here? Well, I just got here. But I saw a patrol car outside. - Do you live here? - Yes. What happened? Was there anything unusual on the night of the 28th? Did you hear anything suspicious? On the 28th? That's two days ago. Think about it. Nothing happened lately, sir. What about you? I have no idea. Did something happen? It's not much. A dead body was found. We think she lived here. This happens all the time. It looks like she committed suicide. I'm a 20-year-old trainee who came to Seoul with a dream of becoming an idol star. Recently, I suffered from symptoms of depression. After overcoming it, I worked up my courage to make a wish... Seo Min-ji 3 followers, 3 following Rest in peace. I miss you, my friend. Min-ji, I miss you. Min-ji, rest in peace. Comment Sorry... What does your life mean? Delete I'm asking you. Answer me. So someone is playing tricks with you using the account of the deceased? I searched Seo Min-ji's account to see if she is related. Ereshkigal... left her the same comment about a week before she died. Ere, what? Hey, enter Ere... you-know-who's account. What does your life mean? 13K Followers, Ereshkigal What does your life mean? Who are you? Did you kill Seo Min-ji? We just live in the flowing time. Listen to the Queen of Death and be saved. So, are you saying... Ere... you-know-who killed Seo Min-ji? I'm not sure, but something is going on. It was deleted later, but I got his reply right away. The field investigation has already been done. The cause of death is clear. Why are you doing this? What do you mean why? We just want to do what's right. We don't need a reason. Hey. Do you think we're playing around here? No, that's not what we think. We're busy people, you know. Because of social media, we're already getting too many unnecessary tip-offs. We'll take care of this. Go home now. Please investigate it at least. It was suicide. Case closed! The lab results support this. Hey, look. Why don't you... go study if you have so much time on your hands? You said you're preparing for the police exam. You know it's highly competitive these days. That's irrelevant. It's not irrelevant! You guys are jobless and have nothing better to do. That's why you have your head in the clouds! Just go home! I'm already busy. - Hey. - Yeah. Do we seriously look like losers? What are you talking about? Not at all. You're awesome, dude. You're really awesome. I mean it. And you're nice. You're a righteous person. You're Genie. Just like Lupin. He's right. We're losers. The detective was... Don't let what he said bother you. Seong-min. Let's do it. Do what? Let's reveal the truth behind Min-ji's death. For real? Yes. For real. What? You're not in? Of course, I'm in. I'm the preserver of justice. I must do it. What are you going to do? Do you know him? Hey, be polite. Hello. Are you the ones who called? Thank you for your service. Come on in! Call me. Come on here now! Seong-min! So you're saying someone was killed through the Internet? Yes, that's right. But we don't have strong evidence yet. That's why we're asking you a favor. Don't mention it! I'm a man. I keep my words! What did I tell you? We're in the same industry, so we should help each other. Sure. But I'm not good at computers. Hey, Miss Kim! Boss, just call me by my name. I'm not a waitress. Don't call me Miss. What? She's so rude! Okay, I got it. I'm sorry. She has a nasty temper, but she's the brain here. She majored in computer in college, too. She'll be helpful. Thank you so much! Then take care of your business. I always work in the field, so I won't be here. - You can visit here anytime. - Thank you. - Hoon! - Yes, boss! Let's make money for Miss Kim's salary! - Sure, boss! - Okay. I'll be back, Sis! Work harder, please! My salary is a bit unsatisfactory. You're a nasty one. What are you waiting for? Come here to work. He must be a pro. He used an IP bypass program, so I can't trace the address now. First, I'll run his account and related information on the search program to find out his identity. But if those don't overlap with his other accounts, then I can't guarantee anything! Then there's no other way? If only I could have the victim's hard disk... But the police or her family must have already taken it. Just in case, I'll retrace those who visited these accounts. You're so smart! That's a compliment. Keep going, please. I like working in the field. This is boring. I'm also good at working in the field. Don't you want to work? That was a compliment too. Why are you being so sensitive? Anyway... Hey, by the way, Ereshkigal... What does that mean? I don't know. What could it mean? You didn't even know that? You're not ready to investigate. A Sumerian goddess The goddess of the underworld in Sumerian mythology. The queen of the underworld and the older sister of Inanna. Famous for killing Inanna who was trying to extend her powers to the underworld. There's no follower. But many people often visited his social media. Shall we visit it? Seong-gyun left us. Thank you all for your prayers. Chan-hyeok, I miss you. Rest in peace. What the hell? As you saw, there are dozens of victims. If the killer hasn't been caught yet, I don't think he could've physically killed so many people without leaving any evidence. How did he kill so many people without getting caught? Nice People Co. Ltd. I got myself into a mess trying to help you guys. I'm sorry. We didn't have any other option. If you don't want to... Since I've seen what happened, I can't sit on my hands now. I totally have a good eye for people, you know. And she's a righteous person. It's written all over her face. Before reporting to the police, at least raise an issue online. Without strong evidence, the police will do nothing. I'll track the IP addresses of the alleged victims. Check if they really are victims. And just in case, look for a way to prevent further killings. How are we supposed to do that? Wow, she's so rude. Hey, isn't she kind of pretty? Are you taking the subway or the bus? The taxi. Taxi? I don't have money. I do. Who is it? How do you do? We're... Seon-ho's friends. So what? We'd like to ask you some questions about Seon-ho. I'm sorry, but I'm not ready to talk to anyone yet. Come again later. But I only have a few... We're sorry. Excuse me. He's a real jerk. Do you think he knows how much people are suffering because of him? Now, we know for sure, and we must make him pay for it. But how did he do it? How can he kill people using social media? Does this make sense? Seong-min! I've got somewhere to go with you. Where? For profiling. Pro... Oh, profiling? You want to shoot a profile photo? Park Seo-won PhD in Criminal Psychology Let's go! - Jun-hyeok. - What? I think someone's following us. What? For real? Hey, don't turn around. I'm not sure how long he's been following us. I definitely saw him near the guest house. I was not sure when I saw him near the villa. He's across the street. Wearing a cap and holding a camera. Where is he? Just behind us. Hey, what are you doing? Why are you shushing me? What are you doing in front of my store? I'm talking to you. You should listen to me. - Jun-hyeok! - Okay! I only treat the illness of the mind. So this is all I can do for you. It's okay. Thank you. He'd be in big trouble if I had caught him. Do you know most people today have mental illnesses caused by stress? Only the severity of their illness differs. I sort of knew that. Everyone has a self-defense mechanism of looking for a place to escape upon becoming fully aware of their weakness. Death could be an escape for some. Then... Do you think it's possible to murder someone by psychological control? I can't give you a definite answer now. But if the culprit has an ability like that, I think it's very dangerous for mentally unstable people to get involved in this case. What are you talking about? Those who ignore the reality only make their lives harder. I don't know anything about Jun-hyeok or Seong-min. I think it's best for you to focus on what you can do now. That's my advice. Ji-na, how was our broadcast today? I almost died from laughing too hard. Not because you ate too much? Not at all! That's all for today. Please click recommend and favorite this channel! See you again! Thank you for your work. I'm frigging full. Include this when you pay me at the end of the month. Sure. Take care. Hey. It's been a long time. Min-su, sorry to barge in on you like this. It's fine. That's how celebrities work. How's it going? I'm... still busy seeking a job. What about you? It's not that easy to live as a broadcaster. A broadcaster? I have a favor to ask you. How many viewers do you have? It's not the same as before. But I still have quite a lot. What do you want? Just say it. I feel like throwing up. Ereshkigal is killing so many people. So dear viewers, don't go near him! Don't even be curious! If you get any comments or DM, just ignore him! Just ignore him. Don't respond! Don't talk to him. Do people still watch mukbang shows? They're not trendy anymore. We need to do something. I'm busier now than when I prepared for job interviews. What about your part-time job? I told my boss I'd take a break. What about you? Sorry I dragged you into this mess. Hey, it's not your fault. You know me, dude! I'm the preserver of justice. I feel so powerless. In fact, since this happened, I've been worried about you the most. I worried you might get depressed and even give up on looking for jobs. Hey, it's not your fault. Don't feel guilty. You sounded like an adult for the first time in a while. Well, I am older than you, dude. Rude detective girl: Let's meet. It's urgent. How old is she? She keeps talking down to me. Hello. Ms. Kim Noo-rie, we'd better respect each other. That's not what's important. Come here now! Dang. How old are you? Where are your manners? Take a look at this. What does your life mean? What the hell? How did he find Noo-rie's account? Do you follow each other? So it's possible we're being watched now, right? Under these circumstances, our theory could be right. Like the guy who followed us, there might be an observer. He could've collected our personal information from the web. He could've used that information to approach me on social media. It's not impossible. This is too dangerous. Why don't we just call the police now? First of all, we should get him. Even we couldn't get him. How are you going to do that? Did you forget who I am? Hey. I think it's too dangerous. She must have a plan. And you have me, too. Nice to meet you, Queen of Death. Where the hell is he? Hey, look. Over there, there! He's on the rooftop of the building behind your office. When you lure him, we'll... Hello, hey! - She's a complete nut. - Why? She's so hopeless. Hey, let's go now! - Hey, Noo-rie! - Noo-rie! I told you I'm good at working in the field. What are you waiting for? Carry him. How did you do it? Hey. Have you heard of Scissor Hands of Bongam-dong? Tell me everything while I'm being nice. I'm scary when I'm angry. Talk now! Aren't you sorry for the victims? Use your brain. He won't confess that easily. What's this? He's a total pervert. What? Let me see. He's a real pervert. You're a total perv! Hey! This is... I'll confiscate this. Let me see it again. She seems familiar. Get out. Confess. Or you'll die here. At first, I got to know him on social media. It was just nice talking to him. He was a good listener. So we became friends and kept in touch. One day, he started threatening me, saying he knew my secrets. He threatened to reveal my secrets on social media if I don't complete the missions he sent me. I was going to report it to the police at first. But I couldn't. His missions were nothing big anyway. What were they? He wanted me to monitor a girl. He gave me her information. It was nothing. It was just watching her day-to-day life. It kind of felt like I was playing a game. It was fun to peek at other's private life. So I did as I was told. But one day, I found out that the girl I was monitoring had died. Why do you keep doing this even after knowing that? You know... it's quite fun to peek at someone's privacy. Don't you think so? Do you have a death wish? Hey, calm down. Doesn't it scare you that something like that really happened? Do you think it'll be over if you report to the police? People on social media look happy and decent, right? But how scary do you imagine it would be to have everything you had hidden behind the Internet, all of your secrets and weaknesses, exposed to the public and become ostracized from society? Hello, Detective Go? Mr. Jeong Jun-hyeok. I meant to call you. What happened? We caught the culprit. If you don't complete the mission before the deadline, you and your family's secrets will be sent to your friends. The same rule applies if you tell someone about it. The final mission The final mission: Kill yourself. I heard you're still trying to track him down. It's all over now. So keep out of this! And don't write nonsense on social media. You're not a detective. Please know your place. The creator of the social media game Black Sunday, who caused more than 100 deaths, turned out to be a sociopath. He committed suicide using an improvised pistol while he was being arrested. Those who ignore the reality only make their lives harder. If you're doing what you're doing to prove your values, perhaps, the killer might be doing the same. Yo, bro! The rude detective girl is here. I got it. I'll be out soon. What's the sound? It's from next door. Want me to have a word with your neighbor? Leave him alone. I'm leaving here anyway. - Jeez. - Let's go. Wait, wait. That voice is familiar. Ereshkigal is dead? Yes, he killed himself. Weird. He didn't seem to be the type to end things so easily. That's what I'm saying. Are you sure? I think so. That's what the police concluded. Something smells fishy. Let me look into it. You don't have to. It's all over now. No, not yet. You've met Detective Go. He's not the type to work hard. And Ereshkigal didn't work alone. There was a whole gang! Then it might not be over. Then what should we do? There's nothing we can do now. Like Detective Go said, we might have been on a wild-goose chase. Noo-rie, how did you end up working in this field? I don't know. After I got fired for fighting with my boss, I started this job to make some pocket money. And it's already been a year. It's so like you. Is it? It was no big deal, but I felt depressed. Actually, I received treatment too. I just felt depressed because even though I was getting older, I felt like my situation wasn't improving. Then... I had to do anything. That's why I started this job. I've told you too much. What about you guys? What? I'm just trying to be a police officer to make a living. It's one of the most stable jobs. It's easier to take out a loan when you get married. Being a civil servant is the best job. Is that all? Yes, do I need another reason? If you want to get married, you have to find a girl. To find a girl, you must have a job. That job is being a civil servant. How smart. I envy you. Thanks. I'm no different. I might get married soon. I went to see the counselor earlier today, and she seemed to have a thing for me. I could tell from her eyes. She said that rather than being a police officer, being an artist suits me better. An artist! - Hey, bro. - Hey. Are you even studying these days? Why are you making me feel depressed? As if you're studying. Frankly speaking, I'm a little worried about the reality. You're preparing for an exam. And I'm still a job seeker. We can't live like this forever. Hey! You must do what's right. You must bring justice. Let's do this to the end. You said you want to get out of the guest house. You said you can't drink. I have to drink since I'm feeling blue. The society is making me drink. Pour me another glass. Hey, ask for another glass. She doesn't look it, but she's darn heavy. Is she still sleeping? Don't even talk about it. She's so hopeless. Nothing happened to her because I'm a decent guy. If it were another man, something bad could've happened. She's fearless. Let me sleep in your room tonight. Sure. Hey. I get what you said earlier. No, don't bother about it. I just have a lot on my mind these days. If you make a choice without regrets, I won't blame you. What are you going to do? I have no idea. You know me! - Sure. - What, dude? I just agreed with you. I'm the Scissor Hands. Don't forget. What the hell? Don't be scared, it's my room. Call me when you get up. This room is not soundproof, so speak quietly. Seong-min. I'm a dog if I give up now. If you got time to go out, study! I want to be a police officer. Pass the police exam. There's no adversity that cannot be overcome. Dreams come true. Here is the information on the IP address you traced. Thank you, sir. Miss Kim. Yes? You're still young. You'd better find something else to do. You should do what you want. Noo-rie. What the hell? Did she leave without a word? What's this? I'm leaving. Study hard. Study if you don't want to stay here for another year. She's kind of cute. According to what you told me, the culprit is very intelligent. Why would he have replied to your messages despite the risk of being exposed? Perhaps it's someone who's very close to you or has a grudge against you. Glad to meet you, Ms. Noo-rie. You knew that I wasn't gone. It's 3 dollars. Have a good day! - Hello, Min-su. - Hey, we're in trouble. He's going to do a livestream. The psycho will mess up everything. What? We got a tip-off. Check his account now! What are you talking about? Now! Jun-hyeok, we're in trouble! Isn't it dangerous? He's popular among teenagers. Livestreaming on Thursday at 9pm What does your life mean? Hey, check this out. On Thursday at 9pm. It's awesome! It's an emergency. Why isn't she taking the call? Hello? Noo-rie! Did you see Ereshkigal's account? What are you talking about? What do you mean, stop? No, not that. Now, you! Did you see what Ereshkigal posted online? It's major trouble. What are you talking about? Hello, hello? Noo-rie! Hey! Noo-rie! Where are you going? Seong-min! Noo-rie! Noo-rie! Noo-rie! Noo-rie, are you okay? Noo-rie, wake up! Noo-rie! Noo-rie! What the hell? Noo-rie. - Hello? - Noo-rie! We've got an emergency here. Yes, please come here as soon as possible. Noo-rie! - Noo-rie! - Yes. Hey, Noo-rie! Life is a race toward death. Only death is the salvation from sufferings. Save yourself. Seong-min! Maybe you should stay with her. Hey. I need to go somewhere. Go home first. Where are you going? I have something to take care of. I'm not going to do anything stupid. What is it? Follow me. Life is simple. It's about having a full stomach! Isn't it true, Ji-na? Of course. But you'd better control your appetite. The delivery just arrived! Ji-na, wait! Ereshkigal, you psycho. Are you watching now? What are you doing? Get off me! Don't harass people in the shadows like a coward. Step outside and get in the ring with me! I'm Choi Seong-min. I'll break your fingers so you can't use them ever again! Bring it on! - I'll kill you, come on! - What are you doing? - Get out! - Bring it on! - Get out now! - I'll kill you! Ereshkigal is a devil. Kim Ho-seong, who died, and those who monitored you are all his pawns! That's why even after their death, another Ereshkigal will turn up. Glad to meet you, Choi Seong-min. I didn't know you'd contact me. Don't hide behind a computer. Come outside. I'll tell you where I am if you answer my question. His followers worship him like the lord of the cyberspace. They don't know that the devil will eventually kill us all. What the hell? Stop the nonsense and tell me where you are. I'm coming. You want to be a police officer, yet your words are quite rough. Did you do a background check on me? You'll regret meeting me before I became a cop. You're done for, you psychopath. Do you want to be a cop because of your resentment toward your father? But... Why should I believe you? You have to believe me. That way I can live! The final mission The second mission: Listen to the music in this link. Don't communicate with others for 24 hours. Fourth mission: Talk to yourself about the most painful memories. Seong-min! Seong-min! Hey, hold yourself! Jun-hyeok. What's wrong? What did you talk about with the psycho? He's a complete nut. Did you forget that? What's going on here? Well. Like hypnosis, he broke my heart. I thought I could get over it. But I was weaker than I thought. I thought wondering about what's right and wrong and about how to live my life were just signs of puberty. But being an adult doesn't mean you get all the answers. I don't know how I should live on. It feels like time flies endlessly. Noo-rie. Don't let it bother you. He's just a lunatic killer. You're the only person left. What's this? It's your call, Jun-hyeok. It could be dangerous. Let's get a job! Key to a successful letter of self-introduction to get a job Key to Writing a Successful Cover Letter I'm a dog if I give up now. Do you really have to do this? Don't worry. I'm leaving now. Jun-hyeok. I'm sorry I can't help you anymore. I'm a broadcaster, you know. Please believe me for one last time, Detective. I know who the real culprit is. I'll text you his address. Sorry. Get out. Get out of my way! I said get out of the way! Don't blame others. You dug your own grave. You're nuts. You're all killers. Could be, but... It's natural to kill others to survive. Hey! - I'll kill you! - Seong-min! Don't touch my brother! You're all dead now! Hey, what brings you here? I heard from Noo-rie. Leave this to me and go! Are you really a good fighter? I told you. I'm the Scissor Hands. Leave now! Don't move, you punks! Go now, dude! Don't move! Even a slight touch of my hand will tear you up. Don't follow me! If you get caught, you're dead! - Dammit! - Hey, stop there! Mr. Jeong Jun-hyeok? Detective Go, you came. The IP address I tracked down is right here... But I don't think I sent you the text. I told you to stop, you punk. Hey, I cleared my mission! Delete the photo as promised! If anything happens, I'll kill you. Detective Go, what's going on here? Shut up, you punk! Hey! I told you to stay out of it. You're nothing. There's nothing you can do. I got dragged into this mess because of you guys, so don't blame me. Damn. There are a lot of you. Hey. I'm so exhausted now. If you leave now, I'll let you go. I knew you wouldn't leave. Bringing justice is hard work. Hey! Bring it on. Are you the leader? Bring it on, dudes! Come on! Glad to see you again. Genie. All the pain you're suffering is caused by the system created by humans for convenience. The morality of feeling guilty is also learned. You don't have to give much meaning to the ideology created by imperfect beings. We're all born to suffer. Stop getting attached to a life meant for pain. After listening to this music, you are going to obey her. You can't refuse. She is the Queen of Death who will save you. Got it. Nice to meet you, too. I can't sleep these days thinking of the people you killed. That wasn't my intention. Sorry about that. Thanks to your promotion, more people got enlightened. I was going to visit you soon. Why? You couldn't kill me with your almighty social media? I see. I've never been consulted by you. I just want to enlighten you, that's all. Stop the nonsense. You're just a lunatic killer. Well. What does... your life mean? Stop your nonsense. Park Seo-won. No. You're Park Ji-hyeon. When you first visited my boss, I did a background check on both of you. It's just my job, no hard feelings. Then I found out that your post complaining about Do-yeo Chicken became popular online three years ago. Your post became a hot topic on social media and led to the boycott of Do-yeo Chicken. As a result, the parent company, Se-young Group, which supplied defective ingredients was investigated by the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety. As you know, Se-young Group went bankrupt after that. Moldy Do-yeo Chicken Case started on social media. The IP address of Seo Min-ji's account was traced to New Life Psychiatric Clinic. Park Seo-won is the only daughter of CEO Park Tae-seong of Se-young Group, who committed suicide. Her real name is Park Ji-hyeon. Aren't you looking for the truth? But who judges what's true or what's right and wrong? The law? The morals? They're all systems created to make our lives more convenient. Can you say you're righteous? Then do you think you're being righteous by returning the pain you experienced to others? CEO Park Tae-seong of Se-young Group charged with embezzlement Se-young Group caught supplying defective ingredients CEO Park Tae-seong summoned by the Prosecutor's Office Do you think people died because of you? Because you made me a monster? That's not true. Someone did something wrong. And someone made that known to the world. Don't take after me. I love you, Ji-hyeon, my daughter. And someone else became a scapegoat as a result of that. People aren't interested in knowing what's right or wrong. They just believe what they want to believe. Let me apologize. It's all my fault. It not your fault. So you don't have to apologize. Then why are you doing this? I'm just grateful to you for giving me the enlightenment. I want to tell you the truth as a token of my gratitude. The truth? The truth is that you're just a crazy killer. You're just... rationalizing your twisted behavior. If you can't accept it, I'll give you enlightenment regardless of your will because you're very special to me. Hey, you punks! If I were in good shape today, you'd all be dead. Why are you fighting so hard? You must do what's right. To bring justice to the world, you punk. You fool. Maybe this is better than living meaninglessly. Don't be scared. In the end, life is... a race toward death. Wait! You might be right. You know what good speakers like you have in common? They're too focused on winning with words that they don't know how much time has passed. You pretended to be strong. It serves you right! Hey. What brings you here? I'm good at working in the field. The hospital was boring me. You guys are in big trouble now. What are you waiting for? It's time to work! Yes, Sis! I'm chicken-hearted, so I couldn't come here alone. What the hell? Come on. Come on, stand up! Are you the one who messed with Miss Kim? Ereshkigal livestreaming Black Sunday lyrics Park Ji-hyeon! It's over now. Stop it. Well. What makes you think so? Other people might still want me. You need a way out of this cruel world. Sorry, but... I started the livestream first. What you have done and what you look like now are all being streamed live right now. I don't think anyone would listen to your devilish words anymore. It's really expensive. Be careful. If it breaks, I have to eat 100 chickens. People aren't interested in knowing what's right or wrong. They just believe what they want to believe. They only think inside a frame created by someone else. Why are you doing this? What do you get out of this? The public's attention? Or... the justice you guys like to talk about? What does my life mean, you ask? I don't know. But... As you said, I didn't want to disappear in flowing time. This is my answer to your question. Well, then. The end is the same anyway. Wait! Soon, you'll see what true salvation from a painful life is. You never had respect for others' lives, yet you were scared to take your own life? How could you pass out from falling on an air mat? Park Seo-won. You're under arrest for inciting the suicide of 135 people including Kim Seon-ho and for the attempted murder of Jeong Jun-hyeok. Seong-min! Are you all right? Sure, dude. I'm older than you. Jun-hyeok? Yes. Are you okay? What happened to Park Seo-won? Thanks to your livestream, I was able to act quickly. Thank you, Detective. Stay healthy. Keep up the good work! Let me know if you need anything. Yes. Please give us the civilian gallantry award! I'm starving now. I'm craving meat. You know I sacrificed myself back there, right? You were getting your butt kicked! Be quiet. I wasn't kicked in the butt. I kicked theirs. Introduction to Police Studies Oh, profiling. It wasn't a profile photo. I'm so embarrassed. The whole story about Ereshkigal, the Queen of Death Hi, guys. I'm Noryangjin Genie. Today, I'll tell you the story about Ereshkigal. First of all, I revealed the whole story about Ereshkigal on social media. Three years ago, I was a job seeker, and still am. I was making ends meet by doing part-time jobs. But one day... Moldy Noryangjin Do-yeo Chicken The world belongs to a dreamer! 120,500 followers The picture of moldy Do-yeo Chicken I uploaded on my social media went viral. Eventually, Se-young Group was under investigation. And CEO Park Tae-seong killed himself. Like she said, it might or might not be my fault that she turned into a monster. Some people might see me as a hero who caught Ereshkigal. However, I don't think it's up to me to decide. I might have started all this. I'll accept any encouragement or criticism from you. Share The truth, the meaning of life... I still don't understand these. I am neither a child nor an adult. However, they are up to me to decide. This movie is based on the "Blue Whale Challenge" that took place in Russia. It is estimated that this game caused 130 suicide victims in Russia. The creator of the game, Philipp Budeikin, was arrested and was sentenced to three years in prison.
