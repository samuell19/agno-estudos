3:00 a.m., and we're still here answering your calls. Sharing your problems, listening. My children, my motivation to go to work, just to get up in the morning. I don't really know where to start. Now they're just ignoring me. They won't answer my calls. It makes me so sad. I feel like I'm not needed at home, as if I'm not there. 'Cause there's always a way to be happy, and we just have to find it. "SLEEP TIGHT" Happy- That's exactly my problem. That I can't be happy. I never have been. Not even when good things happen to me. You can't imagine what it means to wake up every day with no motivation. The effort it takes me to find a reason, just one, not to let it all go to Hell. And believe me, I give it my best shot. My very best. Every day of my life. "MONDAY" We have time for one last call. Come on, we're late. That's enough! Stop messing around! Stop playing with your bag! Got your lunch? You got it'? Come on, quick! Ursula! What's up? Nothing. I was just saying good morning. Morning. - Come on, let's go. - Good morning. I was thinking we could use gauze. Yeah, and bring me the catalogs. Okay, we'll finish them in leather. Okay, we'll be in touch. Ciao. Morning, CÃ©sar! Miss Clara. Everything all right'? Everything's great. Hello, VerÃ©nica! Well, that's it for us today. You're up earlier than usual. What choice do I have? Poor Rocio. She can't hold it long, you know'? Well, off we go. What time is it'? 8:25. I'd better go. Oh, CÃ©sar, I think my sink's clogged. Could you take a look? I'll stop by this afternoon. Thanks! Ciao. Bye. Morning. Morning, CÃ©sar. Morning. - Morning. - Morning, CÃ©sar. Hi, Mom. How are you feeling? So what do I have to tell you about today? The truth is, I don't have much to report. The neighbors are behaving themselves, well, most of them. My only concern is Clara. I'm trying my best, but I think it's going to be tougher than I thought. But I don't want you to worry. I'll think of something. - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. Do you know what time it is? Obviously not. It's 4:26 p.m. Not bad. You've beaten your own record. Sorry, I was visiting my mother. Today it's your mother's fault. Yesterday it was the radio's fault for putting you to sleep. Look, you have hours to keep. And if it's at 4:00 then it's at 4:00. CÃ©sar, what a stroke of luck. We've got a problem. Well, I'm sure we'll be able to solve it. Last warning, okay? What's the problem? This afternoon, my friend's celebrating her birthday. And at the bingo hall, I tell you! That's good, isn't it'? It's my little ones. I feel awful leaving them alone. Don't worry. I'll take care of them. Really? It's no trouble. You just have to give them dinner. But remember, Rocio has her own special food. The yellow container, no more than two cups. That's it. If not, the poor girl gets indigestion. Then she gets such terrible diarrhea. I know. Don't worry. Oh, and I left you a piece of pie in the kitchen. I made it myself. Potato. Delicious! I'd best be off, or I won't get a seat. Enjoy yourself! Same to you! "3B Out at..." Why can't we ask Dad? As if we'd do that. We'll hold hands and ask him. Evening. How was your day? Crazy! Residents going out, mail, residents coming in. I thought I was going crazy. Well, you can relax now. It's my turn to clean after their posh shit. And their dogs, too. What, and I don't'? You just keep quiet. The kid's right. He cleans, too. "Their posh shit." Each to his own, right? And what about you? Sitting here all day, doing nothing. Well, I wouldn't trade this for anything. Yeah, I bet. Look who's talking. You'd love to be in his shoes. Oh, yeah, that's my dream. Fuck, Ma! Don't give me any lip! Here, the office keys. Leave them in the cupboard when you're done. Yeah, like always. Here. UP you go. Potato. Delicious. Hi, Clara. Hmm, hmm, hmm. So you don't like bugs, eh, Clara? "TUESDAY' At it again? What the hell are you doing? What about you, dickhead? That's the real question. I gave you what you wanted. Yeah, but you didn't expect 60 shitty euros to keep me quiet forever. Or do you think I'm stupid? What do you want'? An adult movie. What? You heard me. Okay. Now get to bed. Good morning. Good morning, dear. You don't have Rocio today. That's right. The poor thing isn't well. I don't know. She must have eaten something. She's got awful diarrhea. And at her age, I'm afraid that... You should start getting used to the idea. Even though it's painful. Yes. How was bingo? "12 UNREAD MESSAGES" "I dreamt about you again last night. You can be such a whore." "ERASE ALL" Excuse me. CÃ©sar. CÃ©sar, yes. What is it'? Yesterday I spoke to the estate agency, and they want to know how the cleaning woman is doing, whether you're satisfied. It seems some of the neighbors have complained. I haven't noticed, to be honest. But I can ask. Please, if it's no trouble. I'll need an answer soon, though. Yeah, I'll ask. Thanks. And sorry. Good morning. Good morning, Miss Clara. Sleep well? You seem tired. You're right. Lately I wake up feeling awful. And ifs not due to lack of sleep. CÃ©sar, don't call me Miss. It feels weird. I'd prefer to. It helps me in my work. As you wish. Running late today, aren't you? - What time is it'? - 8:30. Oh, no! And I think I've lost my watch. Was it valuable? To me it was. It was my mother's. Oh, I stopped by your apartment. You do have a clog. I'll go back this afternoon with the drain cleaner. Great. I've got to run. Thanks. And if you find a watch anywhere... You sure everything's okay? Yeah. Ciao. What the hell? I've still got five- What are you doing here? Shouldn't you be at school? What do you care? You got what I asked for? This where you live? What a dump! Not that you spend much time here. Here. Enjoy. What? It's what you wanted, right'? Have you watched it'? Now go. I ran into Clara on the elevator. We got to talking... about you. What did you say? Are you worried? You mean she doesn't know'? What did you say? Nothing. But from now on, the price is higher... about 100 euros. Make sure nobody catches you with that. What is it today? Just finishing lunch. Had a hectic morning. Sure. You don't go up to the rooftop much, eh? What? What do you mean "what"? You were instructed to water the plants. You were told not to water them at mid-day. But of course you couldn't give a damn! Look at them. All dead. Look at the Musas, all dead! Do you have any idea what they cost? Those ugly things? You should have seen his face. The Musas. Today was a good day, Mom. Now, there's just Clara. She's a tough one, eh? Always that smile, "Everything's good, everything's great!" "Everything's great." Anyway, I think we're on the right track. We'll wipe that smile off her face. She just needs an extra push. Ah, one more thing. The office workers came to see me this morning. I don't want to butt in, but... I'd be a bit more careful if I were you. What did they say? They complained about the condition of the office. That's not true. - I go over it all. - Shut up! They're pretty angry. They wanted to speak to the agency, but I told them to wait, that I'd talk to you first. Mom, I swear- Just shut it! I've fucking had it! I'm really sorry. That's what they told me. I'll clean with him today. And CÃ©sar... Thanks. Think nothing of it. Hello? Hi, baby. I already had dinner. No, I've been sleeping fine. But it's been tough to wake up, so I'm groggy all day. Yeah, text messages all day, a couple of emails and letters. Yeah, I spoke with the police again. It seems the emails all come from cybercafÃ©s, so they can't do much. They said I shouldn't worry. Probably just some nut who doesn't even know me. No, I dropped some papers. I'm a little dizzy. No, I'm fine. It was nothing. You and your doctors! Yes, he said it's stress, and I should take it easy. Yes, of course. If I tell my boss I'm going to see you in San Francisco, he'll have a heart attack! Oh, I found my watch. It must've fallen in the sink, but the concierge ruined it with drain cleaner. You're so mean! No, the poor guy. He didn't know. He even left me a note. Okay. Good night. I love you. I think it's time we got serious. 'WEDNESDAY" What the... - Good morning. - Good morning. How are you feeling today? Better. Doesn't look like it. Hell, CÃ©sar! You sure know how to treat a woman, don't you? With all the time I've spent in front of the mirror... But you're right. Too much make-up, right'? No, it's just that that rash doesn't look too good. It'll get better. Gordi! Yes, yes, of course. "THURSDAY" Dear Clara, I think it's time to stop fooling around. I thought you'd have guessed who I was by now. You've no idea how sad it makes me that you've forgotten, because I've been thinking about you all these years. I went to the dermatologist. It's an allergy. He gave me some pills, and it should be gone in a few days. I've often followed you to the Metro. I was so close I could even smell you. You reeked of make-up. Lately, you aren't looking well. You look fucking sick. Morning, Miss Clara. - Morning. - Sorry. Ciao. In a hurry, isn't she? Honestly, I don't know how she stands it. Maybe she's a little bit like you. A nut job who finds victims at random, eh? Here we go, Clara. Here we go. "MON DAY" CÃ©sar, you have to help me! Come with me. My apartment's full of bugs. The bedroom... It's that way, CÃ©sar. - Where? - At the end of the hall. - Cockroaches. - Cockroaches? Stay there, all right'? Hurry up, please, CÃ©sar. Are you there? Yes. In the closet. Grab me a dress. Which one? The grey one. There are two. The first one you see. Shake it out well, please. Got it. And shoes, the brown ones. Dark brown? No! no: Light brown, then? Huffy. please! Thanks. Hurry. And my bag, too. Shake it out, please. It looks like you've got quite an infestation. It's so disgusting, CÃ©sar. And to think I was sleeping in there. Shit. Maybe you bought some rotten fruit and there were eggs inside. These bugs breed in a few days. Eggs? Gross. So what should I do? Well, fumigate. You'll have to clean the whole apartment. They breed so quickly. Could you fumigate it'? Really? Great! In the meantime, I'll stay at Mom's. No, I think you should stay. Stay here? No way! You saw what it was like. Yes, but I'll have to throw out a lot of stuff. It's better that you stay. Doesn't matter. If something has to be thrown out, just call me. It was spring cleaning time, anyway. I'm serious. I need... What do I do with your clothes? My clothes? Fumigate them. Put them in a bag, and I'll take them to the cleaners. What have you done, CÃ©sar? What's up? My apartment's infested with bugs. Eggs and everything. You should go back to the doctor's. It doesn't look good. No, it's going away now. You should have seen it before. The cream seems to be working. I've been having a run of bad luck lately. Let's hope it ends soon. Is he still harassing you? What? That nut job, the one sending you messages. How do you know about that'? I think you told VerÃ©nica. You know how she is. Yes, he's still harassing me. She said you knew him, a friend of yours or something. No, that was a false alarm. The police looked into it, but he's been living in Geneva for years. Whoever it is uses a prepaid phone, so they can't trace him. But the police located the signal or whatever, and he's sending them from here. What do you mean? It's someone in the building. That's how he knows me. But he doesn't know they know. So while he keeps sending messages, they tighten the net around him. Sooner or later they'll get him. Because he won't be stopping today, will he? I doubt it. Here's my number. Once it's fumigated, call me. Yes, don't worry. Things are getting complicated. I think I've gone too far. You know I've never gone this far with anyone before. Because I've been so hopeful. For the first time, I've had a reason to live. I haven't been up to the roof in days. And I hadn't even realized it. And yet all of this for what? For that bitch to keep smiling every day like nothing's happened. Happy. And me back to square one. Those are reasons enough, aren't they? You'd love that, wouldn't you? You'd love that. To get rid of the piece of shit you gave birth to. But no. Not yet. First, I'll wipe the smile off that bitch's face, whatever it takes. Well, what do we have here? What a waste of space you are. And it isn't just me who thinks so. I've got your references. It seems you don't last long at any job. Three and a half months, Balmes 53. One month, Aribau 14. One month! Odd, isn't it'? What I'm saying is, you should start looking again. Because you here... 'WEDNESDAY" - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. Is there a problem? Can we have a word, please? Yes. You can't do this. We won't be long. The IP matches. They were sent from here. Yesterday at 8:18, Tuesday at 8:24. That's impossible. No one's here at that time. Anyone else have access to the office? That's about the time when they're cleaning. Apparently he's helping his mother, but judging by the neighbors' complaints... Well, now we know what he was really up to. Hello? Miss Clara, it's CÃ©sar. Hi, CÃ©sar. How's it going? Good. I'm calling to let you know I finished fumigating. It's all clean. Problem solved. Great! I can't wait to come home. You heard about the cleaner's son? Yes, I know. So come home whenever you want. I took the liberty of cleaning up a bit. That wasn't necessary. But thanks anyway. I'll be back tonight. Yes. Thanks for everything, CÃ©sar. Think nothing of it. Think nothing of it. I'm ready. I can't wait! I've still got some marks on my back. I'll keep my eyes closed then. You're so silly! What's that smell? Shush! Shit. "THURSDAY" When you get UP. I need you to help put that cream on my back. Come back to bed, Mimi. No, come on. I'm so happy. Lately I've been waking up fine again. Maybe that's all it was, that I needed you here. And for that guy to stop messing with you. Yeah, that too. The cleaner. What nerve! And while he was working with his mother. I don't want to talk about that, baby. It's over now. - Mimi - What'? What's this stuff? What stuff? Under the bed. Wait, I can't hear you. There's a sports bag here. What is all this stuff? No idea. It's not mine. What do you mean? It's not yours? No. That's strange. Strange? No, Mimi. There must be an explanation. The concierge was here fumigating. It must be his. And he left his stuff under your bed? What's this? Looks like a diary. And that key? Marcos. What's the matter? - I'm dizzy. - You're dizzy? Here. Wait, here's another pillow. You're still not well. I don't care what the doctor says. I'm really worried. I'm feeling better now. You sure? Yes. I'm even hungry. That's a good sign. I love you. I'll make breakfast. Okay? What do you fancy? Juice. Which kind? Orange and banana. No, kiwi. There's nothing in the fridge, Mimi. Oh, that's right. What'll we do? Well, let's go out for breakfast. Okay. And we'll get some groceries. Milk. Milk and cereal. Nutella. What? Nutella, milk, cereal. Bread. Oranges. Let's go out for coffee. No. They charge you 4 euros just for writing your name on the cup. You're so stingy! Just make up a name! You could be... Go take a shower. I'm starving. Why don't we shower together? What if we just go back to bed? Why do we have to get up? Because we have things to do. What things? We can't spend all day in bed. It's the first morning I've felt good. We could go away for a few days. Where to? I don't know, just away. We could stay here and relax. We'll rent some movies. Yeah, and you'll fall asleep in ten seconds. Okay, but first we're going to the doctor's. I'm serious. Hey! Hey! What's the matter? What are you doing here? Who the fuck are you? How did you get in? What are you doing here? - This isn't your apartment. - Clara! I'll ring the police. I'm warning you. He's the concierge. Miss Clara, you're here! CÃ©sar, what are you doing here? I'm really sorry. I wanted to tell you this morning, but I didn't see you. I left my fumigation gear in the bedroom. Worse than that, Miss VerÃ³nica's keys are in there. My God! You scared us to death! I'm really sorry. You can't just come into people's apartments without permission. Sorry, but Miss VerÃ©nica was asking for her keys, and I didn't want to admit I'd lost them. They could fire me. Relax, they're here. I'll get them, okay? Are you staying for a while? Do you use a saw to fumigate insects? No. Why are you wet? There was a pipe burst. A total disaster. Thank you so much. You're looking a lot better. Yes, these few days away have been good. Thank you, Miss Clara. I'm really sorry. By the way, CÃ©sar, how much do I owe you for fumigating? Nothing. You don't owe me anything. Just don't say anything about the keys, and we're even. Don't worry about that, but I'll pay for your work. We're square. Thank you. And welcome back. To you, too. And sorry again. You've really made it easy for me. Today you've beaten your own record. This is your notice of dismissal. You've got 15 days to vacate the flat. You can appeal, but I'd advise against it. Are you sure you'll be alright? Yes, don't worry. I'll find something. I don't know what's come over them. They also fired the cleaning lady. She'd been with us for years. Know that my babies and I have absolutely no complaints about you. Quite the contrary. You know that, don't you? Oh, CÃ©sar, we're going to miss you. And if you're going out with your girl, don't worry. Put it in the fridge and eat it tomorrow or the next day. It keeps well. You're very kind, Miss VerÃ©nica. No. I don't understand why you're single. No kids and no partner. And it'll only get harder. You're old. And you'll get older. It's a shame you have to waste away in that apartment. The dogs help, of course. But they aren't children. Just mutts. Let's not kid ourselves. Because I see. I spend hours here. The neighbors talk. I realize. They pretend to listen to you. But it's out of pity. Really, they couldn't care less. So don't trust them. Believe me. You're past it. And terribly alone. And believe me, there's no remedy for that. Thanks for the stew. Excuse me. Hello. Hello, VerÃ©nica! I'm off again. But just for the weekend. Are you feeling all right? Are you sure? Hello, CÃ©sar. Will you be gone for long? No, just four days, until Sunday. Come on, Clara. The doctor's appointment is at 6:00. Where are you off to? Away- Have a good weekend, CÃ©sar. Hello, CÃ©sar. I'd just like to thank you for the show. You've helped me a lot. So tell us, what is it that prevents you from being happy? That's exactly my problem. I can't be happy. I never have been. I think I was born without that capability, like being born blind or deaf, only worse. You can't imagine what it's like to wake up every morning with no motivation. The effort it takes to not let it all go to Hell. And the only thing that helps me is knowing that others are unhappy, too. And believe me, I give it my best shot. My very best. That's why I want to thank you for what you do. You've helped me a lot. Really. But it doesn't matter anymore. I don't see why you're so worked up. What do you want me to do? Throw myself out the window'? How am I supposed to react? How'? By trusting me, for example. Mimi. Can we try to discuss this like adults? I swear I'm trying to. I know, darling. But I haven't seen you in six weeks, and we always use a condom. Always. At the very least, I have a right to be surprised. Surprised, yes. So am I! But it's one thing to be surprised, and another to insinuate... No, I'm not insinuating anything. I'm just saying it seems a little strange, that's all. You heard the doctor. It can happen. You're only four weeks pregnant. But the doctor said! Fuck! It's technically possible. Yes, technically. Go to Hell. Leave me alone, please. Our affair is starting to bear fruit, eh, Clara? Maybe I haven't done such a bad job after all. It's a shame our time is running out. "FRIDAY" - Hi. - Hi. I asked for you at the front desk. They said you'd be here. What's up? It seems that Clara's still got some bugs. You might have to spray the place again. Could you take a look, if you don't mind? Sure. Hang on. Come in. I don't see anything. No? Look closely. Maybe in the bedroom. And Miss Clara? She's not here. Don't worry about her. What is that'? What the fuck is all that'? What is it'? How long have you been coming in here? How long have you been coming in here? Five weeks. Five weeks? Clara doesn't mind. Clara doesn't know about it! What did you do to her? I kept her company, unlike you. What did you do to her? What did you do to her? Can't you guess? "It's technically possible." CÃ©sar Manso? Please. This way. This is the concierge. No, I told him I no longer work here. Right. Come with me, please. Can you give us a minute, please? Do you know this man? Yes. He's Miss Blas' boyfriend. What happened? Suicide, apparently. We're not sure. Suicide? We'll see. Seen any unfamiliar people coming into the building today? No, I don't think so. Are you sure? Like I said, I don't work here anymore. I wouldn't know. Right. I understand that you have the keys to all the apartments. Yes, as concierge, I had access to the keys. Is something wrong? I know Miss Blas quite well. I'd like to offer my condolences. Now is not the time. "I SAW YOU! ! !" Looking for me? Dad! Mom! Dad! Morn! Morn! Mom! Relax, they're only asleep. I wouldn't scream, if I were you. My brother? What are you going to do to me? No. No. No! Dad! Listen to me. I've done terrible things to Clara. And, yes, I was involved in her boyfriend's death. Let's not kid ourselves. Know why I'm telling you this? Because I want you to know what I'm capable of. I know everything about Clara... But also about you. I know which school you go to. I know where your grandmother lives. I've seen your Twitter profile. I know who your friends are. Vanesa. Katia. Sofia. So if you say anything, I know how to hurt you... Badly. You and your family. Understand? Understand? And if not... Good morning. - Leaving? - Yes. It looks like you're in a hurry. Like I said, I no longer work here. Yes, of course. But I'd like to ask you a few questions. Shall we? There isn't much to see. Don't worry. I'm not sure how I can be of help to you. I thought it was suicide. That's the problem. We aren't completely sure. The thing is, we've found your prints all over the apartment in the most unlikely places. Yes, Miss Blas asked me to fumigate her apartment a few days ago. And I was... Yes, she told us. She also told us how you met Mr. BazÃ¡n. Who? Her boyfriend. The deceased. Oh, right. It was quite an awkward situation. I can imagine. But I never got to know him well. I mean, I don't know what their relationship was like, if you get me. No, I don't get you. What do you mean? I don't know. It's all a bit awkward. Awkward? Well, if you want, we'll talk about something else. Let's just say I'm not sure things were exactly harmonious. No? I heard them arguing the other night. Okay. Miss Blas told us they were having some problems. I don't know much about that, and I barely knew him, but the day it happened, he seemed quite upset. Upset? Upset how'? I don't know. Nervous. Slightly out of it. I see. But it'd be best to ask the girl who lives across the hall. Really? She told me she saw him on the landing and got quite scared. But she'd be able to explain better. Yes. We'll ask her. Thank you. Think nothing of it. Miss Clara, finally. How are you feeling? I didn't think I'd see you again. I wanted to tell you how sorry I am. It's a horrible tragedy. I can't imagine what you're going through. Well, thank you. Thank you for your help. Good-bye. I hope to see you smiling again. Are you happy now, you bastard? Well, no. Not yet. Clara! A letter. Dear Mimi, I hope you don't mind me calling you that. I guess nobody's called you that in a while, and I thought you might like it. I've waited patiently for the fight time to send you this letter. And I can tell you it wasn't easy. But the time has come for you to know everything I've done, my reasons, and how important you were to me. You won't believe how often I've imagined your face as you read this, how you would feel. And I can assure you that that has been enough to keep me going. I just hope that whenever you look at our child, you remember me. Everything I did. All the nights that we spent together. I know that this letter changes everything. But I don't care. Thanks to you, I finally know how to be happy. And I assure you, I'll give it my best shot. "MONDAY" "SLEEP TIGHT"
