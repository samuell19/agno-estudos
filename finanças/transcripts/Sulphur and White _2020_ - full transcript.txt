Come on, Mum. Faster, Mum. Come on, go! Alright. ...is the name of the dance we do down in Johannesburg way... Hey, Dora. Come over here. Dora, look at me. Sawubona, David. What?! Sawubona. Ye-bo-to. Yebo. Yebo. Here you are, David. - Good? - Mm-hm. Open the back door for me. Ah! Whoa. What do you say, David? Hm? Thanks, Dad. Remember, darling, Daddy's got his boss here so best behavior. So you found it easy to settle? Not sure. My office is... erm... There was talk of a window office. - Come on, Titch. - Langsamer - Oskar! - Don't, David! Behave yourself or you're going home. Koetze. Koetze! Come and join and meet the blow-ins. - He's your go-to guy. - Hi. Anything you need in God's own land, he's the man. Well, Donald, you don't mind if I have the pleasure? You look like you need to dance. Come on. - No, I can't. - You can. It's easy. You're with Dieter's bank, yeah? Yeah, I am. I was brought in from England to head up a team. - Is that your kid? - Aye, yeah. I wasn't sure it was a boy with that moffie hair. Mum. Mum! Oh, oh! If I had a wife like that, I'd have her dance with me all the time. See you Monday. - That was fun! - Yeah. Joanne, Joanne! Ralf's going to take Oskar and Arno to the airfield on Saturday. He'll take David too? That'll be great. Thanks for having us. - Pleasure. - Bye. Bye. - Why didn't you dance with me? - Dunno. - And a one and a two... - Mum. - Hurry up. - And a two. - You've got to go round. - Mum! - Come on! - And a one and a two... You say something? I didn't say anything. Get in. I was dizzy. He was twirling me around as I was dancing on the floor. - You're a whore. - No! Donald, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do... Please! - Ah... - Is that what you enjoy? - Making a spectacle. - I was dancing. Please stop! No, stop! She doesn't like it. It's alright. Mummy's OK. Whoa! Guys, he's coming in. Put them down. Can I hold them? Well, if you touch them, they'll be tainted. Their mother will reject them... ...destroy them. Rabbits will do that. Yes, boss. - This way, Madam. - Yes, please. What can we give it if he doesn't have any? - Dunno. - Carrots. - Morning, Mrs. Tait. - Hi. I don't suppose you sell pet supplies, do you? If you've thought of it, I have it, Mrs. Tait. Oh. Oh, sorry. It's for a rabbit. - Mum. - Uh-huh. Thank you. It's the spoilt items tin. There's no difference. Go on. Thank you. Your favorite. Come in, David. Now! Sit. Mum. Sit. I know. Hold on. The beers should be coming out soon. Joanne! Donald, the Government will have gone to pot by the time we have our meat, huh? Donald's doing a fine job. Fine job. Joanne! You must't creep up on me like that. My hands are all... all sticky. Will you help me, please? Come on. Whoa! Shit! - Watch your fingers. - Ah... See. Roussi, why don't you help the boy? Yeah, yeah. Oh, shall I take him up to the bathroom? Oh, no. I can... I can do that. Ah. He's quick on his feet, your boy. He can help at the petrol station. Stacking shelves, cleaning up. I can drop him home after. I... I don't think Joanne... Who makes the decisions in this house? Unless you're too high and mighty to let him work. Like Michael and his old man. Is that it? Hopefully. It's alright. It's OK. Hold still. Pills... Bye. Love you. Mum. Dora! Hi, David. - So, how did it go? - Good! Ah, well done! Dad... Well done. Mum... What's happened? We think a snake must have got in, darling. - Did it... did it get them all? - Yep. Must have frightened her. When rabbits get frightened, sometimes they... They kill the babies so that other creatures can't hurt them. - It's OK. - Mum... It's OK. I'll bury them. Er... you can knock off now, Billie. Get up! Steal something of mine?! I didn't really think it would matter. What would your father say? - 20 bid 50. - Yours. - 50? 70 bid 50? - Yours. - 20 bid 50. - Yours again. - Dollar-Yen's getting... - 70 bid 50. 15 bid 50. 70 bid... The whole world's a fire sale! What have you got? What have you got now? 80 bid 50! 50 below. He's buying. Piling up. Only fucker on the planet who'd do this. 50 bid 50... - 20 bid 50? - Dave! All yours, mate. Dow down 750. The apocalypse! 80 bid 50! Results! ...I'm working 25. Emergency Fed meeting! Place a bid. Figure big. - He's not still buying?! - God knows how much. - What's he trying to prove? - 50 bid 50? Now he's chasing the price up. Raise the bid to the figure. Pick your bid. - Go back to 400. - Nice job, Dave! - Cheers, mate. Nice. - Lucky fucker. Well done, son. Man, you did it! Tightrope the Ganges. Fucking weirdo. Offer 50 at 45. 3 for 50. And I'm working nothing. This microphone's a bit... Got anything else? Commodities all doing the same. Dave? I move everything for you. How do you do it? 15 months. Straight positive. 18 months. I'm not quibbling. But I knew I was right about you. I doubt the amounts involved would impress you, Jeff. You don't feel the pressure, do you? Let's see if you can keep it up. ...gone the same way, you get a government bailout. Every seller went cold. Go Yen above the figure. Er... he's choking. Is anyone... Can anyone help here? - Can anyone help? - You alright, mate? - He's choking... - Excuse me. Come on, Jamie! You alright? Chew! You getting some deep throat, mate? Paul... Paul! Aw... Today's the day! Oi... Let's have it then, Kobe Bryant. Bonus day and you missed. White whale, OK? You got to get that... Same here. I've got bidders... There isn't really any problem in being found with that kind of thing. Yeah, Tom, I'll call you back in a couple of hours when we have the prices and then... Yeah, alright. Absolutely. Bye Tom. Cheers. Er... I hear you had a good one. Yeah. Yeah, not bad. Yeah. Will you come to Paris with me? Er... are you serious? Yeah, I booked the Eurostar and a hotel... George V. I've not been. But Jeff takes his wife there. You've booked a hotel room?! Yeah, but I'm... Aren't you married? - Yeah, but we don't have to... - Er no. You're right. Yes? Someone in reception for you. I'm not expecting anyone. Tell them I'm in meetings. They said it was urgent. Yes. Yeah, I'm just on my way there now. Sorry, I'm running a bit late for my table... If you could hold the table for me that'd be great. Great. See you in a bit. Thank you. How did you find me? David, there's so much... You're married, aren't you? And you've got a boy and a girl. Is that right? I'm so proud of you. So proud of what you've become. Look, I've got to be upstairs. Erm... Just wait a second. You got a pen and paper? Why don't you write down your number? That's great. So I have it. David... Mum. - Mum... - Mm? David, come out. David, open the door. Come out, now! Why don't you want to go, David? Huh? Go on. I'm listening. Come on, eat up, if you want to grow tall. How...? You don't like my cooking anymore. What is it? David... Arno's here. Do you want to come and play? What are you doing? Lying in the dark. You don't want to go and play? What's the matter? Is it Daddy? You know what he's like when he gets stressed. He's working so hard. They never said it be this many hours. How have you hurt yourself? David! David, stop that! David! David, look at Mummy. What are you doing? Darling, please don't do that. Don't scare Mummy. Come here. It's OK, it's OK. It's alright. Please don't do that. Don't scare me like that. Baby, it's alright. Everything's going to be OK, I promise. Darling... David. David, please. Pete made sex with Zalba Schouten. She let you? - Her idea. - So what happened? She made me lie on top her... with my thing out. Then she rubs back and forwards on her... underneath bits. Then she went and started making these weird noises. Ah... ah... ah. And she said, "Oh, Pete!" Did it just come out? Then she went on really moaning, gripping onto me. She had her eyes shut tight... like... And her face all screwed up. And she went, "Ah!" Then she said, "You've got to tell me you love me." Eugh! - Where's he going? - He's probably just... What do you expect, hm? So that's what your friend Dieter said, "with immediate effect". That doesn't make any sense. They'd have to give you at least some notice or pay-off? How can they just let you go like that? What would you know? You've never done anything? They won't be needing Daddy at the bank anymore. It means we can go home. Look, erm... Come in, now. - Dark horse. Slipping in late. - Hiya, Jeff. What's this? All schmoozed, hey? Nice place, Jeff. Stunning! Yeah, well, wish I could use it more. Amber's down here in the weeks spending my hard-earned on interiors, psychoanalysis, the fucking menagerie. - Have you got a drink? - No... In you come... Just let me greet this fucking annoying... Filipe. - Jeff, how are you? - Fine. - Beautiful place. - Thank you. - You look lovely. - Thank you. Come on in. David... meet Filipe. - Pleasure. - The only Greek I like. - Vanessa, you know. - Hello. - Here, let me tell you... - Oh, yes, please. - OK. It's... - So, what's er...? What a slog, eh? Yeah. I'm just taking it all in. What do you make of him? He's OK. - He believes in me. - Your Majesty! Not compensating? Aren't we all? Once this... then what? Death, I guess. What will you buy when you're as old and loaded as Jeff? A car? Hm... OK, a road you could drive on. Stereo on. Trees either side. France, right? The Highveld. Sunset. Stir up the dust. Hurtle up and down. Not hurt anyone. Playing Bruce Springsteen, "Born to Run"? Afropop! Isn't this fantastic? You're also with the bank? Yeah. What about you? - Private equity. - What sort of interests? Pharmaceuticals... mainly. We go into drugs where there's demand. What sort of drugs? Viagra? AIDS meds? Hm... sweet. Once you've picked up the rights, the pills only cost a dollar to make. So, what, you create the dearth? Oh... wouldn't put it like that. Dollar's not what you sell them at. So, aren't you? Of course, not. No. - So you up the price? - Naturally. By, what, 200... 300? Really? North of that. So you manipulate the price of AIDS treatment. Let's just enjoy the generous hospitality here. Sir. Drink, sir? Hello. Hey, man, watch it. Clumsy... Like another? Yeah, thanks. I'll go with the vodka. Tea, Madam? Thank you. - It's David, right? - Hm. I'm Amber. - I just insulted a Greek. - Probably deserved it. Off with his head. He's with a woman he doesn't deserve. And this lot... Jesus. Audition them. Amber, Jeff's wife. Forgive me. It's like "Alice in Wonderland". The absurdity of it just reminds me of this. Off with his head. - That's your favorite quote? - Oh, no. That's more Jeff. What's yours? Mad Hatter: "When you can't look on the bright side. "I will sit with you in the dark." And will you? Um... - Mr. Tait? - Yeah. Jeff needs to speak to you. Now. So, my friend. How was Saturday? - Where were you? - Mumbai. Raj, I think I'm going to be fired. What did you think of the party? It was really nice. Nice? It was great. It was a fantastic party. Un-fucking-believable is what it was. I was watching you the whole night. What do you want, David? - Jeff... - The more I look at you... ...the more I see me. You want to make it work. Hm? They're putting you up for the management committee. You deserve it. You're the motherfucking Jeff. You're the fucking Jeff. I'm going to take them off you. There you go, my darling. That's for you, my second wife. That is for you, my third wife. These are for me and these are for my little baby boy. - Seriously, I'm done... - No, no, no. We've got big plans for you. Ready, steady, go. Come on, my love. Charlie, refuel. Go again, go again, go again! Here's dinner. Donald? Mm. I'm not hungry. No appetite. You could get a new job, Dad. How about we get you a new job? David... David! I was speaking to you, David. Come back here. - Mum? - Yes. Can... can we go away somewhere? I just... I just don't know... I don't where I'd take you. It might not be yet. I'll have to think about it. Mum... - Sorry. - It's OK. I was just hearing about your New York antics. You and Jeff on a 72 hour bender. Yeah. It's sort of radioactive looking. I'm not a luncher generally. No time. Got to keep moving. I remember you said racetrack in your Ferrari. I said dust track. In a rusty Beetle, actually. Is that really what makes you get out of bed? I want to win. I'm sitting there day and night to win. You should eat raw meat, not raw fish. - Does that sound bad? - Yes. Well, it's a game, I suppose. But then you miss all this. You don't miss what you don't know. Fuck's sake, Dave. You're repelling them. So what about Filipe? Difficult language to learn, Greek. Desperado! - What's he hiding? - Should have gone for Ed. He called again. He says, "Will you switch your mobile back on?" I'm really attracted to you. We could hang out, right? We could shoot the shit. Shoot the shit? You don't know how to hang out. Yes, I do. We're on the roof of the office! OK, alright. OK. Erm... we could, er... we could go to the seaside. - We could watch the tides. - The tides? Yeah, we could watch them... coming in and... ...out. OK, so are you a high tide or a low tide sort of person? I want to give you what you want. Which are you? Oh, David... David! Stop, stop, stop! Look at me. Sorry. Look at me. Look at me. If you explore, you'll find out what I like. So I thought I'd show you some low tide. A bit of low tide. You deliver. Yeah? - I can race you. - Go on. I could totally beat you, pussy. Ah! Coming! I'm knackered. Knackered. My dad would pack us off to North Wales. Two weeks in a tiny caravan. Four kids and a flatulent Jack Russell. There's nothing like it. What about your folks? You're quiet on the subject. Oh, we're not really close. - Lone Ranger, huh? - Yep. - Am I ever going to meet them? - I doubt it. Right. It's not... erm... It's just... we lost touch. - Anyway, I think she's abroad. - She? Yeah, Mum. Why? Why do you need to know? It's just stuff that matters to me. That's all. What about your dad? Is he here? He's got his life. But he's here, right? It's cold. Come out, now! You little fuck. Fucker. You gay f... It's me. Go away. Come on, David. Open the door. You won't believe the day that I've had. You know the... erm... lesson. You know... you know the church... Mr. Henry, well, he has... he has an ability. He can make it better. He'll wash it away. I saw it with my own eyes and I want you to come with me. Wait, no. Listen, I want you to come with me. Zara from next door, she's coming. - Mum. Mum, she's here. - OK. - Right, ready? - Yeah. - You alright, David? - Alright, Zara. I like your top, man. It looks fresh. - Yeah? - Hm. - Nothing special, just... - It's Ellesse, isn't it? What's wrong? Your mum still buys your stuff? No. David. Come on, hurry up. Girls, come on. Get in. Move yourself. I'm shutting the door. Move. - Alright, Mum. - Alright, get in. Shut the door and then let's go. Lucky it's me on top of you and not one of them fatties. Watch it. A big porky yourself. To achieve what I want to achieve in my life, and to... and to lift the strain and stress off my shoulders. Because I'll tell you what, that's what I'm getting... Jesus! What is up with you lot? I don't know what's got into you. It's nice to hear laughter. - You alright, darling? - Yeah. ♪ ...and let our ordered lives confess ♪ The beauty of your peace ♪ The beauty of your peace ♪ Breathe through the heats of our desire ♪ Thy coolness and thy balm ♪ Let sense be dumb, let flesh retire ♪ Speak through the earthquake, wind and fire ♪ O still small voice of calm ♪ O still small voice of calm ♪ OK, here we go.

Parking space in the basement. My name on a plaque. Got that when I made the management committee. Three... Three months ago. Hm. Vanessa should be along shortly. She's one of the top earners in her division. What happened to the first one? I heard you've got kids you don't see. I provide. Absent father sort of thing, hm? Yeah. Dad doesn't get to see his kids. It's... erm... ...failure on my part, really. But there again... ...leaving them alone... Best thing for them, really. Wouldn't you say, Dad? Wouldn't you? Hello. Well, you must be Vanessa. You must be Mr. Tait. Pleasure to meet you. - Hey... - Hi. Sorry I'm late. No, not at all. You look a picture. Thank you. - Let me fill up your glass. - Thank you. I wanted country church and David wanted Park Lane. So compromise is Park Lane. You'll let us know if you can make it? - I'll let you know. - Please do. All front, you are. You think you turned out alright. You're just me... in a better suit. Ready? Thank you. Deep breath. - Here they are. - Congratulations! What Jeffrey hath put together, let no man put asunder. You look gorgeous. Hold the picture. I'm coming in. Guys, shall we? It's getting late. Yep, come on. Let's go. You two. Go... go... go. Thirsty people, thirsty people. Hey, thanks very much. Yeah, good to see you. - Nice to see you. - Good to see you. That's right. Second floor. Are you still up there? Just over here... Hello! For me? - Going well? - Yes. - This... it arrived. - Hm. - Solid oak - Looks good. Yeah. All done. See you in the morning. Alone at last. Let me show the paint samples. There was just one thing I thought I might... Forget it. Forget it. - Buongiorno! - Surprise! - Where've you been? - Hello! Abstract lovers... Can you see his hip? - Oh, yeah. Is it a...? - Emanuele Rubini! Oh, my dealer thinks it's very important. Thank you. That's very generous. This... and this in it. You lucky fucking bastard. I can't believe how sexy she looks. - Seriously, you do look well. - Oh God! Well done, Chief. Well done. It was the last bonus that made it possible. Admit it, you swiped the fireplace idea from us. - It was already there. - Was it? We had the same architect. It's their signature feature. I tee you up and you cannot help yourself. So this radiant complexion, still as thin as a whippet. - Too early for news? - Jeff! There's no news. Nothing wrong with his swimmers? It's not really on the agenda. It's just not something I'm into. That's all. Might be something I'm into. If was you, I'd give the girl what she wants. What else is there to do out here? Do you have a personal trainer, honey? Media room? I'll come too. If he's not up for the big decisions you take the lead, V. So, the placenta looks nice and healthy. That's the head there, spine... and limbs. Little Mum, me. Oh, you can see the heart... and heartbeat. Baby looks nice and healthy in there. So... any questions? See you at 32 weeks then. And Jeff was saying, well... David's a little out of kilter. Yeah, he never wants to talk about the baby. Today he's flying, for fuck's sake. They spend their days telling each other they're masters of the universe. They're wankers, really. He's not a wanker. Well, he is. Well... David... Hey! It's the last class. I only reminded you twice. This isn't you. It's all because of work. I mean, of course... Jeff, he's a complete ass. But everyone in there thinks highly of you. Not now. I've been so damned scared about pushing you but... ...to be honest, I'm past caring now how you react because your reaction this whole time is eating away at us. I set out with you. Don't we deserve better? Don't you? I'm going flying. You have all of this. You've got me! This is... this is nothing all of a sudden. You don't even feel a sense of duty. You bombarded me, the flowers and the cars and this place. You pushed these images in my face. I can't see anything else. You know what stops me from asking? You know what frightens me is that when I finally get to look, there's nothing there. It's just a void. Why are you a fucking hologram? - How are you doing, David? - Er, good. The 2K? Yeah. He won't break. Hey, little Seth! Oh! Hey! OK. Hey... nearly your bath time. Gonna have a bath. Yeah. Ah, big yawn. Yeah. Still a streak of piss though, aren't you? Only you think that. The look of you... makes me feel a little bit... I've just seen today's news. What's going on with him? Anybody tell me why my system is down? Anybody got an idea on where we are on trading? Jesus Christ! What have I got to fucking do to try and get someone up here? Raj! Where are we on the Euro position? I just need a spreadsheet. Anything that tells me any information. One person, that's all I need. - Dave... - Where are we? Dave. Dave! What do you think? You're way over your skis now. You need to ask Jeff. - Yeah, sure. - He needs to know. He needs profit. Shaun, fuck it! Get on the phone and find out what the Euro position is. Now! Ten minutes! Where is he? Fucking Bermuda? - How many are we down, Raj? - He's down 50. - What are you down? - 70. Can I get a rate on the Euro? Please. Anybody? Anybody? The boy's not firing. Here. He has a check-up at the clinic. Will you watch him while I have a shower? You get settled. Won't be long. Shh, shh. Shit. David? No! David! David! Where is he? Where is my baby? Where's my fucking baby? Where's my baby?! Where the fuck is my baby?! There, he's there. Fuck you! Fuck you! Oh yes. You're a very naughty boy, as I recall. Uh! Don't worry on my account. You wanted this. So you fucking got it. Pardon me?! Oh... The baby is so pretty. Just like Mummy. Oh, the baby's so kind. Just like Daddy. - You complete bloody bastard. - Hm. - I should have fucking known. - Hm. I mean, the signs were there. You've got kids. Should have seen how you've been with them. You married their mum when you were hitting on me. Do it once, do it again. Right? What are you hiding? Fucking... Don't... David Tait? Dr. Mbeke. Hi. We need to ascertain what risk you are to yourself. Are you... are you South African? ...and to others, Mr. Tait. It's my job to decide either to section you so that you can receive psychiatric care or have you released. Do you have a partner? Family? Parents alive? I need you to talk to me, Mr. Tait. What I need to be confident of is that we don't find you splattered over our area of outstanding natural beauty any time soon. I can see how that would... ...how that would be... ...inconvenient. I'll get myself back into the workplace. Your work environment. - It's highly pressurized. - Mm. You think you can cope with that? That's how I cope... Can't hurt money. Quite so. You know, you should talk to someone. - Someone who cares about you. - Well, I had that... But I ruined it. It's ruined. Love is an act of endless forgiveness. You may be surprised. Hi. Do you want to...? You can sit down? - Look, V, I'm sorry.... - I keep wondering ...that with fatherhood, I shouldn't have pushed you. It's just that I chose you. You're the father of my child. And if I'm honest, I don't think I could have accepted no. And then I think about Jeff. You know. Right now, I'm going between myself and Jeff. And then I think about... you. David, we got married. Our baby, it's... ...holding you in some sort of poison vice. It's not... It's... It's here. The thing... You know... On the outside, I'm... smooth and... Underneath, it's... ...hollow. Because you see... Ah... for God's sake, why are you even here, V? Why are you even here?! You don't even think that I might... Damn. Fuck. Just leave it. I'll do it, leave it! It's fine. Leave it, I'll clean it up. I'm here for Seth. You know, we both need to move on... I... I wanted them... I wanted them to fix me before you came. Do you remember... ...in South Africa... ...our whole place was burned, son? Round where your room... Hm? What was she called? Dora. Do you remember Dora? She said to me that... ...you'd grow taller than the trees. - Outgrow all of you... - Mum. He got really angry with me. I can't remember... Can't remember why. But you... You went to talk to him and told him to leave me alone. You'd grow tall... strong. I told myself that. I didn't... worry then. I didn't worry about... I am taller, Mum. Just... just let me fix you, Mum. Have you eaten? When I was ten... ...I was a skinny kid. Titch is what they used to say. There was a man in South Africa. My dad had got me a job at a petrol station. Him and his friends, they would... They would take me along a corridor and into a storeroom. And... erm... I didn't know for ages, what it was they were doing. And when it went on, I'd look at stuff. Lines in the concrete floor... ...sulphurs and whites. The butterflies in the bush outside. I'd look. I'd just... I'd be anywhere but there in my mind. What about your parents? Erm... my mum, she was wrapped up in stuff. She didn't... she didn't see. But then back in London, my erm... ...Dad... Your father?! I think she found out then... because... erm... it stopped. So I tried to keep it away. Be the opposite... ...and build this pristine life. And I saw who you are. Pure hearted. The last person who'd ever want to cause damage. And I thought, if we're running alongside each other... But it's in here. And it's... ...ravaging... ...virulent... ...and anything that comes into contact with it just... Shh, shh. Hey... Please welcome to the stage Mr. David Tait.
