[MUSIC PLAYING] [NARRATOR] BY THE 1970s, THE TENSION IN NORTHERN IRELAND REACHED AN ALL-TIME HIGH. CATHOLICS, PROTESTING FOR BETTER JOBS, DECENT HOUSING, AND EQUAL VOTING RIGHTS, WERE OPPOSED BY PROTESTANT-CONTROLLED SPECIAL POLICE, WHO USED BRUTAL FORCE. THE BRITISH ARMY TOOK OVER AND MOVED IN AT THE URGING OF SOME MEMBERS OF THE PROTESTANT MAJORITY. FOR THE LARGE CATHOLIC MINORITY, THIS MILITARY OCCUPATION SERVED ONLY TO INCREASE SUPPORT FOR THE DREAM OF A UNITED IRELAND, AND FOR THE VIOLENT, PROVISIONAL I.R.A. HEAVILY-ARMED PROTESTANT MILITIA GROUPS RESPONDED WITH FULL FORCE, AND IN KIND. NORTHERN IRELAND WAS ON THE EDGE OF CIVIL WAR. [MAN] IT COULD COME TO CIVIL WAR, AND MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT, WE AS PROTESTANTS AND LOYALISTS WILL FIGHT, AND WE WILL WIN. [NARRATOR] IN THE NORTHERN IRELAND CITY OF LONDONDERRY, MANY RESENTED THE BRITISH PRESENCE, WHICH BROUGHT WITH IT AN INCREASE IN THE SECTARIAN VIOLENCE. ON SUNDAY, JANUARY 30TH, 1972, THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE MARCHED TO PROTEST A NEW POLICY OF INTERNMENT, A CHANGE IN LAW THAT ALLOWED THE POLICE TO IMPRISON AND HOLD PEOPLE-- IN PRACTICE, ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY CATHOLICS-- INDEFINITELY AND WITHOUT CHARGE. THE PROTEST, WHICH THE AUTHORITIES DECLARED TO BE ILLEGAL, WAS MASSIVE. WHEN THE PROTEST MARCH STARTED TO WIND ITS WAY PAST A MILITARY OUTPOST, SOME PEOPLE BEGAN TO APPROACH THE POLICE BARRICADES IN ANGER. WATER CANNONS AND TEAR GAS WERE USED TO DISPERSE THE CROWD. WHEN MOST OF THE PROTESTERS WERE GONE, FOUR NEW UNITS WERE SENT IN TO THE BOGSIDE NEIGHBORHOOD ON AN ARREST MISSION... AND THEY OPENED FIRE. IN TOTAL, THE ARMY FIRED 108 ROUNDS OF LIVE AMMUNITION THAT DAY. -[SHOUTING] -[GUNFIRE] [NARRATOR] 14 PEOPLE WERE KILLED AND MANY MORE WERE INJURED. [REPORTER] YOU'RE QUITE SURE THAT NOTHING WAS FIRED AT THEM FIRST. THERE WAS NOTHING FIRED AT THEM. I'M ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN OF THAT. I CAN SPEAK OF THIS WITHOUT ANY DIFFICULTY WHATSOEVER BECAUSE I WAS THERE. I WAS JUST STANDING AT THE FLATS WHEN THE SOLDIERS MOVED IN, FIRST OF ALL, AND THERE WAS NOTHING FIRED AT THEM, POSITIVELY NOTHING FIRED AT THEM WHATSOEVER. THERE WEREN'T EVEN STONES THROWN. PEOPLE RAN IN ALL DIRECTIONS AND THEY OPENED FIRE. MOST PEOPLE HAD THEIR BACKS TO THEM WHEN THEY OPENED FIRE AT THE TIME. MY INFORMATION AT THE MOMENT, AND IT IS VERY, ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE INCIDENT, IS THAT THE PARA BATTALION FIRED THREE ROUNDS ALL TOGETHER. AFTER, THEY HAD SOMETHING BETWEEN 10 AND 20 FIRED AT THEM FROM THE AREA OF THE ROSSVILLE FLATS, OVER THERE. [REPORTER] THEY FIRED THREE ROUNDS ONLY. MY INFORMATION AT THE MOMENT-- [REPORTER] I BELIEVE THERE ARE MORE THAN THREE DEAD. I CERTAINLY-- I HAVE SEEN THREE DEAD MYSELF. WELL, THEY MAY WELL NOT HAVE BEEN KILLED BY OUR SOLDIERS. [NEWSCASTER] THE REACTION IN BELFAST TO THE SHOOTING WAS QUICK. LAST NIGHT, FIRES WERE RAGING IN THE ANDERSONSTOWN AREA, AND FOR SOME TIME, THE FIRE BRIGADE WAS UNABLE TO MOVE IN. THIS MORNING IN CATHOLIC AREAS, BLACK FLAGS WERE OUT AND FEELINGS WERE NO LESS BITTER THAN IN LONDONDERRY. FLEETS OF TRUCKS AND CARS WERE HIJACKED IN ANDERSONSTOWN AT THE FALLS AREA, DRIVEN AWAY, AND THEN BURNED TO PROVIDE BARRICADES. AFTER WARNINGS OF RETALIATION BY THE PROVISIONAL I.R.A. FOR YESTERDAY'S SHOOTINGS, TROOPS WERE ESPECIALLY CAUTIOUS. THE PEOPLE OF THE BOGSIDE WERE STILL STUNNED BY THE SHOOTINGS. THEY WALKED ABOUT AND STOOD IN GROUPS, TALKING ABOUT THE TRAGEDY. IT WAS A CRISP, SUNNY DAY, JUST LIKE IT WAS ON THE DAY THEY'VE CALLED HERE "BLOODY SUNDAY." I WAS AFRAID. WHEN I LOOK BACK ON IT NOW, IF I'M TELLIN' YOU THE TRUTH, I'D BE OUT DOIN' ME SHOPPING. MAYBE YOU'D BE STANDING AT THE GREEN GROCERY END OF THE STORE, AND YOU'D MEET SOMEBODY, ANOTHER WOMAN YOU KNEW, AND YOU BOTH HAD YOUR PROBLEMS, BUT THEY'D ALWAYS BE IN A WHISPER. [WHISPERING] "WASN'T THAT TERRIBLE WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT?" "GOD, DID YOU KNOW HIM?" IT WAS SORT OF PER WOMAN. [NORMAL VOICE] YOU KNOW YOU'D HEAR THIS KIND OF TALK AMONG THE WOMEN. SO I KNEW THAT ANY FEMALES OF THE SPECIES THAT I KNEW WERE VERY ANTI WHAT WAS GOING ON, BUT THEY WERE TERRIFIED TO SAY ANYTHING. THERE WASN'T A MOTHER IN NORTHERN IRELAND THAT WASN'T AFRAID, BECAUSE IT WASN'T-- YOU KNOW, YOU DIDN'T KNOW WHETHER... YOU'D WALK OUT ONE DAY AND WHAT YOU WERE WALKING INTO. SO I KNOW WHY THE WOMEN WERE WHISPERING. I WAS ONE OF THEM. [NARRATOR] 1972 WAS A YEAR FULL OF ANGER. [LOUD EXPLOSION] [NARRATOR] WITH SHOOTINGS, BOMBINGS, AND CIVILIANS DYING EVERY SINGLE WEEK, NO ONE WAS SAFE FROM THE SECTARIAN VIOLENCE. [SCREAMING, CRYING] I REMEMBER A BOMB BLAST WHERE THE WINDOW BLEW OUT. I JUMPED UP. WELL, I HAD TO GO TO THE DOCTOR THE NEXT DAY, 'CAUSE I COULDN'T COPE WITH THE PAIN, BUT THAT'S WHERE ALL MY INJURIES CAME FROM. LOTS OF PEOPLE THAT HAPPENED TO. [NEWSCASTER] YET ANOTHER BOMB BLAST OCCURRED IN BELFAST TODAY, AND AN ELDERLY WOMAN WAS CAUGHT AND TRAPPED IN THE RUBBLE. IT TOOK AN HOUR AND A HALF TO GET HER OUT. THEN THERE WAS A SECOND SCARE. THERE WAS A CRASH AND EVERYONE THOUGHT THAT THE WHOLE PLACE WAS COMING DOWN. [CROWD SHOUTING, SCREAMING] IT WAS A TENSE AND NERVOUS SCENE IN THIS AREA OF BELFAST. AND TONIGHT, THE AUTHORITIES HAVE LITTLE DOUBT THAT MOST, IF NOT ALL OF TODAY'S VIOLENCE, WAS ORGANIZED BY THE ILLEGAL PROTESTANT ULSTER VOLUNTEER FORCE. MY COUSIN DANNY... LOVELY LAD GOIN' TO SCHOOL. JUST...BEAUTIFUL BOY, DANNY DUNN. AND HE WAS WALKING HOME WHEN THEY RIDDLED HIM TO DEATH WITH SIGN OF THE CROSS. JUST-- I'M WAITING ON HIM AND WHEN MY AUNTIE BRADY OPENED THE DOOR, HE FELL IN TO HER ARMS. BRADY WAS NEVER THE SAME AFTER THAT. SHE DIED THAT DAY, YA KNOW? TERRIBLE. [NEWSCASTER] IN EAST BELFAST, A MANAGER OF A LOCAL BAR WAS SHOT IN THE DOOR OF HIS FATHER'S HOUSE. HE STAGGERED DOWN THE HALL INTO THE KITCHEN. THE GUNMAN FOLLOWED HIM AND SHOT HIM AGAIN, RIGHT TO THE HEAD. IT WAS THE THIRD SUCH RELIGIOUSLY-MOTIVATED KILLING THIS MONTH. AND MY BROTHER-IN-LAW, JIM MCGEE, HIS COUSIN... WHO HAD A WEE FARM, HE WAS A POSTMAN. AND THE I.R.A. HAD THIS VAN FULL OF EXPLOSIVE. BUT A BRITISH ARMY FOOT PATROL HAD BEEN SET UP SO THEY LEFT THE VAN AND RAN OFF, AND JOE WAS DRIVING AROUND IN IT AND THE VAN EXPLODED. SO, A CATHOLIC WAS KILLED BY CATHOLICS, AND A CATHOLIC WAS KILLED BY PROTESTANTS. DOES THAT MAKE ANY SENSE TO ANYBODY? I DON'T THINK SO. [NEWSCASTER] THERE WAS ANOTHER BOMB BLAST IN DOWNTOWN BELFAST TODAY. THREE OTHER EXPLOSIONS ALSO OCCURRED OUTSIDE OF THE MAIN DOWNTOWN AREA, WHICH IS SURROUNDED BY A TWO-MILE LONG SECURITY FENCE. THE MAJOR FIRE STARTED IN A TOY AND PRAM SHOP, AND A SHIPPING OFFICE AND A MILK BAR WERE BADLY DAMAGED. THE PROVISIONAL I.R.A. SAID THE ATTACK WAS IN RETALIATION FOR THE RECENT CRACKDOWN BY BRITISH POLICE. THE I.R.A. APPEARED TO BE TRYING TO PROVOKE A BACKLASH, AND TODAY'S ACTIVITIES CERTAINLY HARDENED PROTESTANT OPINIONS. [WILLIAMS] I HAD BEEN TERRIFIED THAT MAYBE THEY WOULD HURT MY CHILDREN. I HAD THE "MY" SYNDROME: WHAT ABOUT MY HOUSE, MY CAR, MY KIDS? [NEWSCASTER] MAY 17TH, 1974. TODAY'S BOMBING REPRESENTS THE BIGGEST, GREATEST LOSS OF LIFE IN A SINGLE DAY, IN WHAT PEOPLE HERE ARE CALLING THE "TROUBLES" IN IRELAND. FOUR CAR BOMBS EXPLODED WITHOUT WARNING, KILLING 33 MEN, WOMEN, AND CHILDREN, AND INJURING ALMOST 300. [WILLIAMS] I SAW TERRIBLE THINGS IN NORTHERN IRELAND, YA KNOW? THINGS THAT STAY WITH YOU FOREVER. [FEMALE NEWSCASTER] FOR THE PAST SIX YEARS, THIS HAS BEEN THE FACE THAT NORTHERN IRELAND HAS PRESENTED TO THE WORLD. PSYCHOLOGISTS ARE NOW BEGINNING TO WONDER JUST HOW MUCH THE YOUNGSTERS OF NORTHERN IRELAND HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY THE NEAR-CONSTANT VIOLENCE. [MIMICKING GUNFIRE] IN THE SCHOOLS, TEACHERS HAVE NOTICED CHANGES IN THE WORK THAT CHILDREN PRODUCE. THE "WHAT DID YOU DO YESTERDAY?" ESSAY IS NOW LIKELY TO INCLUDE A BOMB BLAST, OR A SKIRMISH WITH BRITISH TROOPS, GUNSHOTS, OR GRENADES. THE CHANGE IN BASIC BEHAVIOR HAS BEEN STARK. THERE'S NOW EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST THAT SOME CHILDREN HAVE BEEN SERIOUSLY AFFECTED BY THE ONGOING CIVIL WAR. THE EVIDENCE WAS PUBLISHED IN A RECENT ISSUE OF THE "BRITISH JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY." PSYCHOLOGISTS CLAIM THAT THEIR JOBS HAVE BEEN MADE MUCH MORE DIFFICULT BY THE PHYSICAL SEPARATION OF THE COMMUNITIES OF BELFAST. IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE FOR CATHOLIC CHILDREN TO GO THROUGH THEIR ENTIRE EARLY LIFE WITHOUT EVER MEETING A PROTESTANT CHILD, AND FOR PROTESTANT CHILDREN TO NEVER MEET A CATHOLIC CHILD. [ALL SINGING] ♪ GOD BLESS MY HOMELAND IN DEAR OLD SHORT STRAND ♪ ♪ GOD BLESS MY HOME IN THE DEAR OLD SHANKHILL ♪ [FEMALE NEWSCASTER] THEIR COMMUNITIES ARE DIVIDED BY WALLS. [NARRATOR] TUESDAY, AUGUST 10TH, 1976, WAS A BEAUTIFUL DAY IN BELFAST. MANY PEOPLE WERE OUTDOORS, ENJOYING THE SUNSHINE. AND THEN, TRAGEDY STRUCK. [NEWS ANCHOR] OUR TOP STORY TONIGHT... IN A TERRIBLE TURN OF EVENTS IN BELFAST TODAY, IN WHICH THREE INNOCENT AND DEFENSELESS CHILDREN WERE RUN OVER. A YOUNG PROVISIONAL I.R.A. MEMBER WAS BEING CHASED BY BRITISH TROOPS WHO SHOT HIM AT THE WHEEL AND HIS CAR CAREENED INTO A YOUNG FAMILY OUT FOR AN AFTERNOON WALK. TWO CHILDREN ARE DEAD AT THE SCENE. THE MOTHER AND BABY ARE IN CRITICAL CONDITION. WELL, IT ALL HAPPENED ON FINAGHY ROAD NORTH, AND MY HOUSE WAS OFF OF FINAGHY ROAD NORTH. IT WAS VERY, VERY CLOSE TO THE SCENE. VERY CLOSE. JUST LITERALLY 'ROUND THE CORNER. AND I WAS DRIVING HOME FROM MOMMY'S. THAT WAS A TRIP I DID DAILY. IT COULD'VE BEEN ME. FEEL PRETTY TERRIBLE. WE WENT DOWN THIS MORNING TO THE MORGUE AND WE SAW THE TWO LITTLE ONES AND JUST TO HEAR NOW THAT THE THIRD'S GONE. [SOBS] HAVING A TRIPLE FUNERAL ON FRIDAY. [VOICE BREAKING] IT'S PRETTY HARD. THEN I GOT SO ANGRY. I REMEMBER STANDING IN MY GARAGE BECAUSE MY CHILDREN WERE SLEEPING, AND I WAS SCREAMING. JUST SCREAMING. I THOUGHT I'D GO OUT AND DO A CAMPAIGN FOR PEACE AND HAVE PEOPLE SIGN A PETITION FOR PEACE. AND I HAD GONE DOOR KNOCKING AND ASKING THE WOMEN IN THE AREA THAT I LIVED, WHICH WAS SUPPOSED TO BE I.R.A. TERRITORY. I MEAN, I WAS SO ANGRY. I WAS YELLING AT THE WOMEN. I WASN'T SORT OF NICE LITTLE PEACE PERSON. I WAS THIS RAVING LUNATIC ON THEIR DOORSTEP. "WE'VE GOTTA STOP THIS!" AFTER ABOUT FOUR HOUSES I NEARLY LOST MY VOICE, I WAS YELLING AT EVERYBODY. AND IT JUST TOOK OFF LIKE WILDFIRE. WOMEN JUST-- BECAUSE I HAD GIVEN A VOICE TO WHAT THEY WERE FEELING. YOU KNOW, I MUST HAVE LIFTED THE LID. [NARRATOR] BETTY AND HER NEIGHBORS COLLECTED MORE THAN 6,000 SIGNATURES, AND BETTY SPOKE TO REPORTERS AT THE LOCAL NEWSPAPER AND AT THE LOCAL TELEVISION STATION. AND I ASKED THE WOMEN OF NORTHERN IRELAND IF THEY FELT LIKE I DID. WOULD THEY JOIN ME IN A RALLY THE FOLLOWING SATURDAY AT THE SPOT WHERE THE CHILDREN WERE KILLED? I MET MAIREAD ON THE DAY OF THE FUNERAL. [MUSIC PLAYING] I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS GONNA HAPPEN. I HADN'T GOT A CLUE. NEVER KNOWN THE MIRACLE I WAS ABOUT TO WITNESS, BECAUSE THERE WERE 10,000 WOMEN TURNED UP. THOUGHT IT WAS A SEA OF WOMEN. [NARRATOR] EVEN AS THE VIOLENCE CONTINUED, WOMEN IN BELFAST WERE GATHERING TO MAKE A POSITIVE AND MOVING PLEA FOR PEACE. [SINGING IN UNISON] [NEWSCASTER] WOMEN FROM PROTESTANT AREAS OF THE CITY HIRED BUSES TO JOIN THE WOMEN OF CATHOLIC ANDERSONSTOWN STILL MOURNING THE MAGUIRE CHILDREN KILLED BY A TERRORIST CAR. FRESH FLOWERS WERE PLACED AT THE SPOT WHERE THE CHILDREN HAD DIED. SIGNATURES WERE READILY ADDED TO AN ALREADY LONG LIST OF PEOPLE WHO WANT PEACE. BETTY WILLIAMS, WHO PLANNED THE RALLY, AND MARY MAGUIRE, THE AUNT OF THE CHILDREN WHO DIED, WERE DELIGHTED WITH THE RESPONSE. TOGETHER, THE WOMEN PRAYED FOR PEACE, SANG HYMNS FOR PEACE, AND CRIED OUT FOR PEACE. [WOMEN SINGING] [CROWD CHANTING] WE WANT PEACE! WE WANT PEACE! [NEWSCASTER] THE RALLY BROUGHT COMFORT FOR MANY, INCLUDING THE CHILDRENS' FAMILY. THEIR MOTHER IS STILL IN HOSPITAL. I FEEL FANTASTIC. HER THREE BABIES HAVEN'T DIED FOR NOTHING, BECAUSE THIS HAS BROUGHT OUT HOW THE PEOPLE FEEL. WE ALL WANTED THIS, BUT IN OUR FRUSTRATION, WE DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO GO ABOUT IT. [NEWSCASTER] ANOTHER RALLY WILL BE HELD ON SHANKHILL ROAD NEXT WEEK. [WILLIAMS] WE JOINED FORCES, AND IT WAS A POWERFUL FORCE. ONCE I BROKE MY OWN FEAR, IT ALLOWED OTHERS TO BREAK THEIRS, TOO. [NARRATOR] MEMBERS OF THE PROVISIONAL I.R.A. WATCHED THE RALLY. THEIR REACTION WAS BOTH IMMEDIATE AND VIOLENT. [WILLIAMS] AFTER THE FIRST RALLY, THEY HAD TO GO HOME TO THEIR OWN HOUSES, EXCEPT A LOT OF THEM WERE UNDER THREAT. IT WAS DIFFICULT KNOWING THAT THEY HAD TO DO THAT AND THEY WERE AFRAID. THE WOMEN WERE SAYING THAT THEY GOT THEIR WINDOWS BUSTED. AND SOMEBODY GOT A BUCKET SOMEWHERE AND STARTED GOING ROUND TO THE WOMEN, AND THE WOMEN WERE JUST GOING INTO THEIR PURSES AND PUTTING THE MONEY IN TO GET THE WINDOWS REPLACED. THE WOMEN SUPPORTED ONE ANOTHER, AND IT WAS CATHOLIC HELPING PROTESTANT, BY THE WAY, AND PROTESTANT HELPING CATHOLIC. I THOUGHT THAT WAS AN EXTREME ACT OF COURAGE. [NARRATOR] BETTY AND MAIREAD WERE APPROACHED BY A LOCAL JOURNALIST NAMED CIARAN MCKEOWN. THEY DECIDED TO WORK TOGETHER TO TURN THE CRY OF THE WOMEN INTO A MOVEMENT. [WILLIAMS] "WE'VE A SIMPLE MESSAGE FOR THE WORLD FROM THIS MOVEMENT FOR PEACE. WE WANT TO LIVE AND LOVE AND BUILD A JUST AND PEACEFUL SOCIETY. WE WANT FOR OUR CHILDREN AS WE WANT FOR OURSELVES, OUR LIVES AT WORK, AT HOME, AND AT PLAY, TO BE LIVES OF JOY AND PEACE. WE RECOGNIZE THAT TO BUILD SUCH A LIFE DEMANDS OF ALL OF US DEDICATION, HARD WORK, AND COURAGE. WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE MANY PROBLEMS IN ALL SOCIETIES WHICH ARE A SOURCE OF CONFLICT AND VIOLENCE. WE REJECT THE USE OF THE BOMB AND THE BULLET AND ALL THE TECHNIQUES OF VIOLENCE. WE DEDICATE OURSELVES TO WORKING WITH OUR NEIGHBORS, NEAR AND FAR, DAY IN AND DAY OUT, TO BUILDING THAT PEACEFUL SOCIETY IN WHICH THE TRAGEDIES WE HAVE KNOWN ARE A BAD MEMORY AND A CONTINUING WARNING." AND THAT'S BURNT ON MY HEART. CAN I ASK YOU, WHEN YOU SAY "DEDICATE," -[MAIREAD] YEAH. -IN DETAIL, THAT MEANS WHAT? LIVING 24 HOURS OF EVERY DAY POSITIVELY FOR PEACE. IT MAY TAKE A LOT OF COURAGE AT TIMES. I KNOW THE WOMEN OF ANDERSONSTOWN. I WAS BORN THERE. I WAS BROUGHT UP THERE. I WAS REARED IN AN ANDERSONSTOWN GHETTO, AND I LOVE THEM. THEY'RE GREAT PEOPLE, AND I KNEW THE WOMEN OF ANDERSONSTOWN COULDN'T HAVE APPROVED OF WHAT WAS GOING ON. WE'VE GOT 100,000 PEOPLE ON THE STREETS OF NORTHERN IRELAND WHO'VE COME OUT. I'M ONLY THEIR MOUTHPIECE. THAT'S ALL I AM. ALSO WHAT IS HAPPENING OUT OF OUR PEACE MOVEMENT IS THAT WE'RE GETTING THESE FANTASTIC LITTLE GROUPS GROWING UP IN CATHOLIC AND PROTESTANT AREAS, AND ALREADY WE HAVE THE CATHOLICS AND THE PROTESTANTS CROSSING OVER. AND YOU KNOW, THE ORDINARY PEOPLE OF NORTHERN IRELAND, FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY, ALMOST, ARE GOING TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SAY WHAT THEY WANT IN THEIR SOCIETY, AND THEY THEMSELVES WILL TAKE DOWN THE BARRIER OF FEAR, AND THE PHYSICAL BARRIERS IN THE COMMUNITY. THEY'LL DO IT THEMSELVES, AS THEY PROVED YESTERDAY IN THE SHANKHILL. THE ORDINARY WOMEN AND MEN OF NORTHERN IRELAND-- I'M GLAD YOU BROUGHT THAT UP, BECAUSE WHEN YOU SAID "LITTLE GROUPS DOING SOMETHING," IMMEDIATE REACTION IS TO SAY, "WHAT? WORDS CANNOT FIGHT THE GUNMEN." BUT YESTERDAY WAS THE FIRST DIRECT ACTION THAT THE PEACE PEOPLE TOOK. -THEY STOPPED BUSES FROM BEING BURNED, DIDN'T THEY? -EXACTLY. THIS HAD HAPPENED ON THE FALLS ROAD THE WEEK BEFORE, WHERE THE WOMEN OF THE FALLS HAD GOT OUT AND STOPPED IT, AND WE'VE HAD A FEW INTIMIDATIONS STOPPED-- DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN BY INTIMIDATIONS, EILEEN? -I MUST EXPLAIN THIS TO YOU. -YOU MUST EXPLAIN THIS. I.E., A CATHOLIC FAMILY, LIVING IN A PROTESTANT AREA, SOMEONE WILL GO TO THE DOOR AND SAY, "YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES TO GET OUT. YOU'VE GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE." WE HAD TWO OF THOSE STOPPED BY THE CATHOLIC WOMEN. WE HAD BUS BURNINGS STOPPED BY THE CATHOLIC WOMEN IN TWINBROOK AND ON THE FALLS ROAD. AND YESTERDAY, THE PROTESTANT WOMEN GOT OUT AND DONE EXACTLY THE SAME THING. THEY STOPPED THIS HAPPENING, SO THE TWO COMMUNITIES WILL NOW START HELPING EACH OTHER. [NEWSCASTER] THE TROUBLES IN NORTHERN IRELAND CONTINUED ON THIS WEEK, BUT THERE IS A NEW OUTSPOKENNESS AMONGST THE VICTIMS AND POTENTIAL VICTIMS OF VIOLENCE. IT'S DEMONSTRATED TODAY IN A BELFAST NEIGHBORHOOD, WHERE HOUSEWIVES BANDED TOGETHER TO STOP A HIJACKING. -WE STOPPED THE BOYS FROM COMING UP-- -[WOMAN] HIJACKING A LORRY. HIJACKING A LORRY, AND A BUS THEY TRIED, TOO. AND THEN THE WOMEN HAVE ALL GATHERED-- THERE'LL BE MORE LATER ON. -AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO STAND FOR THIS ANY LONGER. RIGHT? -[CROWD] RIGHT! [NEWSCASTER] AND BOTH PROTESTANT AND CATHOLIC WOMEN, AND EVEN A FEW MEN, MARCHED TOGETHER ON THE SHANKHILL ROAD. [CHEERING, APPLAUSE] [WILLIAMS] WHEN I STARTED THE PEACE MOVEMENT, DADDY DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT IT UNTIL HE SAW ME ON THE TELEVISION. HE WAS VERY NERVOUS. YOU KNOW, HE WAS WORRIED. AND HE SAID, "IN THE NAME OF GOD, WHAT ARE YOU DOING, BETTY? DON'T YOU REALIZE THAT NORTHERN IRELAND HAS A PROBLEM FOR EVERY SOLUTION?" AND THEN PROVISIONAL I.R.A. CAME AROUND AND BROKE ALL OUR WINDOWS IN THE HOUSE. HE TOLD THE PROVISIONAL I.R.A., "YOU BREAK 'EM, I'LL FIX 'EM. AND YOU'LL GET TIRED BEFORE I DO." SO HE HAD EXTRAORDINARY COURAGE AS WELL, BECAUSE WE LIVED RIGHT IN THE HEART OF ANDERSONSTOWN. [NARRATOR] BETTY'S HOUSE BECAME THE OFFICE FOR THE PEACE PEOPLE. AND BETTY'S FATHER VOLUNTEERED. HE STARTED ANSWERING HER PHONE. [WILLIAMS] "NO," I SAID. "YOU'RE OUT THERE STANDING. I'LL STAND RIGHT ALONGSIDE YOU." [NEWSCASTER] TOM JONES, REPORTING FROM LONDONDERRY. THEY CAME FROM THE WATER SIDE, AND THEY CAME FROM THE CITY SIDE, AND THEY MET TOGETHER IN THE MIDDLE. THOUSANDS OF WOMEN, AND QUITE A FEW MEN FROM BOTH COMMUNITIES JOINED FORCES ON THE CRAIGAVON BRIDGE THAT LINKS THE TWO HALVES OF DERRY, THE CITY WHERE THE RIOTS BEGAN EIGHT YEARS AGO. THE PEACE MOVEMENT, JUST FOUR WEEKS OLD, MET SOME OPPOSITION AS A SMALL GROUP OF SINN FEIN SUPPORTERS DEMANDED BRITISH WITHDRAWAL, WHICH THEY CALLED "PEACE WITH JUSTICE." THAT DEMONSTRATION WAS QUITE OFTEN LEFT UNNOTICED, AND THE MAIN RALLY STUCK ONCE AGAIN TO SIMPLE PRAYERS AND PEACE, AVOIDING POLITICAL ARGUMENTS THAT COULD SPLIT THE MOVEMENT, AND ALREADY ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO MORE MARCHES, AND THEY HOPE, MORE SUPPORT. [WILLIAMS] IT WAS LIKE A MEDIA FEEDING FRENZY. IT REALLY WAS... OFF THE CHARTS, MEDIA-WISE. MY PHONE WOULD START WITH CALLS FROM JAPAN. DADDY ENDED UP TAKING THE PHONE OFF THE HOOK. WE WEREN'T GETTING ANY SLEEP, YOU KNOW? ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF WORK. BUT, OH, MY GOD, THE COURAGE WAS SO CLEAR. WOMEN DRIVING FROM THE FALLS ROAD, UP THE SHANKHILL ROAD. BOTH ORGANIZATIONS, CATHOLIC AND PROTESTANT, WELL, THE I.R.A., THEY KNEW THE CARS. THEY EVEN HAD ROADBLOCKS SET UP. OUR WOMEN DROVE THROUGH ALL OF THAT, AND THEY GOT TO THEIR MEETINGS. YOU KNOW, THEY DID WHAT THEY NEEDED TO DO FOR ONE ANOTHER. [CHEERING] [WILLIAMS] THERE'S A POWERFUL FORCE OF GOOD IN NORTHERN IRELAND NOW. NOTHING IS AS STRONG AS AN IDEA WHOSE TIME HAS COME. [SINGING] [WILLIAMS] PEOPLE OF NORTHERN IRELAND HAVE A LOT MORE TO UNITE THEM THEN THEY EVER HAD TO DIVIDE THEM. WE'VE USED RELIGION TO KILL EACH OTHER SINCE TIME IMMEMORIAL. NOW THE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE SAYING, "NO MORE. WE'VE HAD ENOUGH." I HAVE TO GO BACK TO SAYING THAT IF YOU'RE NOT HELPING TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM, THEN YOU'RE PART OF IT. [FEMALE NEWSCASTER] TODAY, ON THE STEPS IN A CHURCH IN ANDERSONSTOWN, THE PEACE MOVEMENT GATHERED TO PRAY AND TO SING FOR PEACE. TWENTY YARDS AWAY, A COUNTER-DEMONSTRATION WAS HELD BY LOCAL YOUTH, UNDER THE BANNER OF THE I.R.A.'S SINN FEIN. AS THE MEETING BREAKS UP, A GROUP OF YOUTH MOVE FORWARD, AND VIOLENCE SEEMS INEVITABLE. ONE SMALL INCIDENT, BUT THE PEACE PEOPLE ARE BEING MADE AWARE ONCE AGAIN OF THE BITTERNESS THEY'LL HAVE TO OVERCOME IF THEIR MOVEMENT IS TO SUCCEED. [WILLIAMS] I'VE SEEN INCREDIBLE ACTS OF COURAGE FROM WOMEN. NON-VIOLENCE IS THE WEAPON OF THE STRONG. VIOLENCE IS THE EASY WAY. I BELIEVE THAT WOMEN, AS THE GIVERS OF LIFE, HAVE NEVER BEEN THE TRUE PROTECTORS OF THAT SAME LIFE THAT THEY SHOULD BE. I FEEL WOMEN'S ROLE HAS GOT TO BE A GENTLER ONE, AND PERHAPS IF WE CAN DO IT CORRECTLY, THE MEN WOULD LIKE TO WALK BESIDE US. [NARRATOR] THE PEACE PEOPLE CONTINUED TO STUDY THE WRITINGS OF MARTIN LUTHER KING, LEARNING THE TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES OF NON-VIOLENCE AS THEY PREPARED FOR YET ANOTHER MARCH ALONG THE I.R.A.-CONTROLLED FALLS ROAD. [WILLIAMS] I REMEMBER READING IF YOU KEEP THE MARCH MOVING, PICK UP SOMEBODY IF THEY'RE INJURED, BUT DON'T LET IT STOP. WE KNEW GOING ONTO THE FALLS WOULD BE HARD, YOU KNOW? AND KIND OF SCARY. I REMEMBER ISABELLE BENNETT, ONE OF OUR TOUGH LADIES FROM STITTENHAM, SAYING TO ME, "WHAT WILL WE WEAR TO THE FALLS ROAD RALLY?" AND I SAID, "FLAK JACKETS AND A HELMET." THANK GOD IT WAS POURING RAIN, SO THE UMBRELLAS WERE UP, AND ONCE THE ATTACK BEGAN, THEY WERE MOVING THE UMBRELLAS FROM SIDE TO SIDE, AND THEN WE'D GET A FLURRY OF IT, AND THE UMBRELLAS WOULD ALL COME TOGETHER AGAIN. IF WE HADN'T HAD THOSE UMBRELLAS, WE'D HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT MASSIVE HEAD INJURIES. BRICKS WERE LANDING ON THE UMBRELLAS AND SOMETIMES TEARING THEM, BUT MOSTLY BOUNCING OFF. THE ESSENCE OF THE MARCH WAS QUIET DIGNITY, AND KEEPING IT GOING, ALMOST LIKE A DRUMBEAT, LIKE A HEARTBEAT. WE WERE JUST IN SILENCE, COMPLETE AND UTTER SILENCE. NOT A WORD. WE JUST KEPT MARCHING. BRUTAL PUNISHMENT THAT DAY, BUT NOBODY WAS SERIOUSLY INJURED. IT WAS MORE EMOTIONAL SHOCK, BUT WHAT A FEELING AFTER IT. NOBODY HURT THAT BADLY THAT THEY COULDN'T GO HOME THAT NIGHT, YA KNOW? [NEWSCASTER] THE PEACE PEOPLE OF NORTHERN IRELAND HELD A MASSIVE RALLY IN TRAFALGAR SQUARE TODAY, WITH AN ESTIMATED 15,000 TO 20,000 PEOPLE DEMONSTRATING FOR PEACE AND WITH AN EXTENSIVE INTERNATIONAL PRESS CORPS IN ATTENDANCE. THIS IS NOT SOMETHING FOR THE WOMEN TO DO. THIS IS SOMETHING FOR HUMANITY TO DO. [NEWSCASTER] THERE WERE ALSO COUNTER-DEMONSTRATORS FROM THE I.R.A.-LED TROOPS OUT MOVEMENT. MARCHERS MOVED FROM HYDE PARK TO TRAFALGAR SQUARE WHERE THE POLICE HAD TO REMOVE HECKLERS TRYING TO DISRUPT THE EVENT, BUT TO NO AVAIL. AT LEAST TODAY, THE ENTHUSIASTIC SUPPORTERS OF THE PEACE PEOPLE MOVEMENT PREVAILED. [NARRATOR] WHILE THEY WERE IN LONDON PREPARING FOR THE RALLY, BETTY AND MAIREAD RECEIVED SOME STUNNING NEWS. THEY WERE TO RECEIVE THE FIRST-EVER NORWEGIAN PEOPLE'S PEACE PRIZE IN NORWAY THE FOLLOWING WEEK. [TV ANNOUNCER] MRS. BETTY WILLIAMS AND MAIREAD CORRIGAN WERE MET AT THE OSLO AIRPORT TODAY BY A NORWEGIAN RECEIVING COMMITTEE AT THE CITY CENTER HOTEL. MAIREAD CORRIGAN, CIARAN MCKEOWN, AND BETTY WILLIAMS, MET THE NORWEGIAN PRESS, THEIR HOSTS FOR THIS VISIT TO NORWAY. AND THEY MET THE JOURNALIST FROM THE NORWEGIAN NEWSPAPER WHO MOBILIZED HIS READERS TO SHOW THEIR SUPPORT FOR THE PEACE MOVEMENT IN NORTHERN IRELAND IN A MATERIAL WAY: THROUGH DONATIONS. I FELT THAT, UH... THEY NEEDED THE SUPPORT NOW. BETTY WILLIAMS AND MAIREAD CORRIGAN, I HAVE THE GREAT HONOR OF ASKING YOU TO RECEIVE THE NORWEGIAN PEOPLE'S PEACE PRIZE. [NARRATOR] NO NOBEL PEACE PRIZE WAS AWARDED BY THE NOBEL COMMITTEE TO ANYONE IN 1976, SO THE PEOPLE OF NORWAY DECIDED TO GATHER TOGETHER AND CREATE AN AWARD OF THEIR OWN, THE FIRST-EVER NORWEGIAN PEOPLE'S PEACE PRIZE. WHEN I LOOK AT YOUR HAPPY CHILDREN, AND I SEE THE CHILDREN IN NORTHERN IRELAND, I SAY, "GOD FORGIVE US. WE ALLOWED THIS TO HAPPEN." WHEN I SEE THESE CHILDREN STANDING HERE, SO HAPPY AND SO PURE, AND SINGING WITH JOY, AND I THINK OF THE LITTLE BOYS ON THE FALLS ROAD OR THE SHANKHILL ROAD, I DON'T KNOW WHY WE LET IT HAPPEN. BUT WITH YOUR HELP, AND GOD'S, WE WILL UNDO ALL THE WRONGS WE HAVE DONE TO OUR CHILDREN. IT MAY TAKE US QUITE A FEW YEARS, BUT AT LEAST IN THE YEAR 1976, WE HAVE-- WE HAVE STARTED. THE VOICE OF SANITY AND OF REASON YELLED UP FROM THE GROUND. IT DIDN'T CRY, IT SCREAMED, "PLEASE STOP." IT MUST START WITH OUR CHILDREN. I REALLY CAN'T SAY VERY MUCH MORE TO YOU EXCEPT I DO LOVE YOU ALL, -AND THANK YOU. -[APPLAUSE] [SINGING] DO ANY OF YOU THINK, AND REALLY BELIEVE, THAT MARCHING WILL HELP AT ALL? MARCHING IS JUST THE START OF WHAT WE HAVE IN MIND, AND WE ARE NOW GOING TO BUILD OUR PEACE, BRICK BY BRICK, WHICH WILL BE A HUGE RECREATION CENTER, RIGHT ON THE PEACE LINES FOR CATHOLIC AND PROTESTANT CHILDREN TO GET TOGETHER AT A VERY YOUNG AGE. WE ASKED PEOPLE TO RALLY BECAUSE WE WANT TO SHOW THAT THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE IN NORTHERN IRELAND BEHIND THE PEACE MOVEMENT. FOR EXAMPLE, THE VERY FIRST WEEK OF OUR RALLY, PEOPLE WENT BACK INTO THEIR HOMES AND THE FIRST COUPLE OF THINGS THAT HAPPENED, ONE LITTLE LADY SAT ON A BUS WHEN THE BOYS CAME TO BURN IT AND SAID, "IF YOU WANT TO BURN THIS BUS, YOU MAY BURN ME WITH IT." THAT WAS THE FIRST EXAMPLE OF PEOPLE IN NORTHERN IRELAND GAINING THEIR CONFIDENCE. BUT THE SITUATION IN NORTHERN IRELAND HAS BEEN BY HISTORY AND RELIGION, VERY COMPLEX. DON'T YOU THINK YOUR APPROACH IS A LITTLE BIT TOO SIMPLISTIC? WELL MAYBE THAT'S WHY IT'S WORKING SO WELL. IT IS SIMPLE. PEOPLE CAN UNDERSTAND AND ASSOCIATE WITH IT. THIS IS NOT A SEVEN YEAR OLD PROBLEM WE'RE TACKLING. IT'S A MONUMENTAL TASK OF 800 YEARS. INSTEAD OF SITTING BACK, WAITING FOR SOME GREAT MIRACLE TO HAPPEN, PEOPLE MUST COME OUT AND DO ALL THE LITTLE SMALL THINGS TOWARD WORKING FOR PEACE. THE CATHOLICS MUST GO INTO THE PROTESTANT HOMES AND OVER A CUP OF TEA, BECOME FRIENDS. IF WE CAN BUILD THESE FRIENDSHIPS BETWEEN OUR TWO COMMUNITIES, AND THEN IN FRIENDLINESS THEY CAN GO FORWARD TO DISCUSS ALL THE THINGS THAT HURT DEEP DOWN THERE, ONCE THEY BECOME FRIENDS. BUT EVERY DAY WE COLLECT NEW MEMBERS TO THE PEACE MOVEMENT. EVERY SINGLE DAY IN THAT OFFICE, THERE'S A NEW PEACE GROUP STARTS. WHETHER THAT BE A BIGOTED LOYALIST, OR A STAUNCH REPUBLICAN, WE DON'T CARE, THEY'RE STARTING TO THINK PEACE. WHAT DO YOU THINK WILL BE THE GREATEST PROBLEMS FOR YOU TO FACE IN THE DAYS AND WEEKS TO COME? I THINK OUR BIGGEST PROBLEM IS OUR YOUTH AND OUR CHILDREN. SOME OF OUR ADULTS, OF COURSE. WE HAVE THAT PROBLEM, TOO. BUT MOSTLY OUR POOR CHILDREN AND OUR YOUTH, BECAUSE THE LITTLE BOY WHO WAS 10 IS NOW 17. HE'S A JUVENILE WITH A VERY WARPED SENSE OF VALUES AND A VERY WARPED VIEW ON LIFE. HE'S SEEN NOTHING, ONLY VIOLENCE, REALLY. YOU ARE, BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU ARE DOING, OBVIOUSLY IN DANGER, EVERY DAY. ARE YOU AFRAID? WE DON'T THINK ABOUT IT. GETTING ON WITH THE WORK OF PEACE IS OUR MAIN OBJECT, NOT LOOKING OVER OUR SHOULDER EVERY FIVE MINUTES TO SEE WHO'S FOLLOWING US. [NARRATOR] AS THEIR MOVEMENT CONTINUED TO GROW, THE PEACE PEOPLE MOVED INTO AN OLD BUILDING, WHICH THEY NAMED THE PEACE HOUSE. [WILLIAMS] WHEN WE GOT THE PEACE HOUSE, AND I'M LEANING OVER MY DESK, AND I SAW THE BARREL OF THE GUN, AND THE HAND WAS LIKE THIS. BOY WAS-- HE WAS SENT TO KILL ME. BUT WHATEVER WAY, I JUMPED FROM BEHIND AND SHOVED AND HE FELL ON THE FLOOR. I NEVER SEEN ANYBODY JUMP AS QUICK IN MY LIFE, AND GRABBED THE GUN AND OFF HE WENT DOWN THE STAIRS. MY GOD, MY HEART, WAS... BA-BUMP, BA-BUMP, BA-BUMP. I NEVER SAID A WORD TO ANYBODY, BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT ANYBODY IN THE PEACE HOUSE TO CALL THE POLICE. OBVIOUSLY THE BOY WAS SCARED. AND THEN I WOULD SEE THE BOY AT VARIOUS THINGS. YOU KNOW, IT'S, "GOD, HE'S IN THE CROWD AGAIN." I'M THINKING THE I.R.A. HAS ME MARKED. I'D SEE HIM OUTSIDE THE GATE TO THE PEACE HOUSE. ONE DAY I JUST TOOK A CHANCE AND I SAID, "DO YOU WANNA COME AND HAVE A CUP OF TEA WITH ME?" HE SAID, "I WON'T GO ANYWHERE WITH YOU. YOU'RE A TRAITOR. YOU'RE NOTHING, ONLY A BRITISH LACKEY," YOU KNOW. BUT WE'RE STARTING TO TALK. [NARRATOR] ACROSS NORTHERN IRELAND, THE ACTS OF VIOLENCE CONTINUED ON. THE PEACE PEOPLE WERE PELTED WITH ROCKS AND THEIR CAR WINDOWS WERE SMASHED. [SIRENS WAILING] BOTH THE PROTESTANT MILITIA GROUPS AND THE PROVISIONAL I.R.A. CONTINUED TO CARRY OUT ASSASSINATIONS, STRIKES, AND INTIMIDATIONS. WE DIDN'T GET IN THAT KIND OF MESS OVERNIGHT, AND WE WEREN'T GOING TO GET OUT OF IT OVERNIGHT. IT WAS GONNA TAKE A LONG TIME TACKLING ALL THE WRONGS. I MEAN, UNEMPLOYMENT FIGURES OFF THE WALLS, PURSE TIGHTENING IN WESTERN EUROPE. ALL THOSE THINGS THAT MAKE A NORMAL SOCIETY FUNCTION, YOU KNOW, WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY OF THAT. WE WERE OFF KILTER, OFF BALANCE, OFF EVERYTHING. [NARRATOR] AT ONE OF THEIR RALLIES, BETTY MET A GROUP OF AMERICAN SUPPORTERS FROM WASHINGTON D.C. THEY TOOK ACTION AND SET UP A MEETING WITH THE LEADING U.S. VOICE ON THE NORTHERN IRELAND ISSUE: U.S. SENATOR TED KENNEDY. I WAS CHOSEN TO GO OUT AND MEET WITH TED KENNEDY, AND WE BROUGHT ANOTHER LADY WITH ME, NANCY MCDONALD. SHE WAS PROTESTANT, AND WE TRAVELED TOGETHER, HER AND I. AND I REMEMBER THE MEETING WITH THEM, AND I JUST LOST IT AND SAID, "WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS WRONG. YOU'RE SUPPORTING POLITICAL GROUPS THAT ARE KILLING PEOPLE." NOT TOO LONG AFTER THAT HE CHANGED HIS MIND, THANK GOD, AND HE MADE THE FAMOUS ST. PATRICK'S DAY SPEECH, SAYING WE SHOULD BE INVESTING IN NORTHERN IRELAND'S FUTURE... ECONOMICALLY FOR HOUSES AND JOBS. HE TURNED OUT DOING A GREAT THING FOR NORTHERN IRELAND. HE REALLY DID. [INTERVIEWER] AND THE CYNICS WILL SAY, AREN'T YOU BOTH BEING A LITTLE NAIVE? EVERYBODY WANTS PEACE. IT ISN'T AS SIMPLE AS THAT, IS IT? NO, YOU'VE GOT TO WORK DESPERATELY HARD FOR IT. I'M AMAZED. I THOUGHT PEACE WOULD COME A LOT EASIER WHEN SO MANY PEOPLE SAID THEY WANTED IT. BUT PEACE IS A THING THAT'S NOT GONNA DROP OUT OF THE SKY. IT'S GONNA HAVE TO BE WORKED AT, EVERY DAY, 24 HOURS A DAY. IT'S MONUMENTAL, THE TASK THAT'S AHEAD FOR NORTHERN IRELAND. [NARRATOR] THE SEEDS OF THE CRISIS IN NORTHERN IRELAND WERE PLANTED MORE THAN 800 YEARS AGO. UNTIL THEN, LEADERSHIP WAS DECENTRALIZED THROUGHOUT THE BRITISH ISLES. SEVERAL REGIONAL KINGS RULED IN IRELAND. SCOTLAND AND WALES WERE ALSO RULED SEPARATELY, AND ENGLAND HAD ONLY RECENTLY BECOME A UNIFIED KINGDOM. ENGLAND DID NOT PAY MUCH ATTENTION TO IRELAND UNTIL THE YEAR 1170, WHEN ONE OF THE IRISH KINGS, KING MAC MURCHADA OF LEINSTER, ASKED FOR HELP IN WAGING WAR AGAINST A RIVAL. KING HENRY II OF ENGLAND WAS TOO BUSY WITH A WAR OF HIS OWN, BUT ONE OF HIS LORDS, NAMED STRONGBOW, ANSWERED THE CALL, AND BROUGHT HIS OWN PERSONAL ARMY OVER THE SEA TO IRELAND. STRONGBOW WON AND HE WAS NAMED THE NEW KING OF THE LEINSTER REGION OF IRELAND. NOW, KING HENRY II OF ENGLAND STARTED TO PAY ATTENTION, AND HE DEMANDED TO BE NAMED THE LORD OF IRELAND AND THAT ALL OF THE IRISH KINGS PLEDGE THEIR ALLEGIANCE TO HIM. THE IDEA OF IRELAND AS A TERRITORY OF ENGLAND WAS BORN. FOR THE NEXT 340 YEARS, THE POPE AND THE CHURCH TRIED TO BRING INDEPENDENT-MINDED IRISH PRIESTS INTO LINE. AND MANY ENGLISH FAMILIES MOVED INTO SOUTHERN AND EASTERN IRELAND IN AN ATTEMPT TO GAIN BOTH TITLES AND LAND. BUT IN THE NORTHERN PART OF IRELAND, THE PEOPLE REMAINED ALMOST 100% NATIVE IRISH. THEN A DECISION WAS MADE THAT WOULD CHANGE THE FUTURE OF IRELAND FOREVER. THE KING OF ENGLAND, HENRY VIII, BROKE WITH THE POPE AND THE CHURCH IN ORDER TO DIVORCE HIS WIFE, CATHERINE OF ARAGON, WHO HAD FAILED TO BEAR HIM A MALE HEIR. HE WANTED TO MARRY HIS PREGNANT MISTRESS ANNE BOLEYN, SO HE STARTED A CHURCH OF HIS OWN, THE ANGLICAN CHURCH, AND NAMED HIMSELF HEAD OF THE CHURCH. AND THEN HE GRANTED HIMSELF A DIVORCE. ANNE BOLEYN BORE HIM A DAUGHTER, BUT NO SON. HE SOON FOUND A WAY TO GET RID OF HER AS WELL, AND THEN HE WENT THROUGH FOUR MORE WIVES. YET WHEN HE DIED, HE HAD ONLY ONE SON, A NINE-YEAR-OLD NAMED EDWARD. EDWARD BECAME THE FIRST BRITISH KING EVER TO BE RAISED AS A PROTESTANT. WHEN THE YOUNG KING EDWARD DIED ONLY SIX YEARS LATER, A DEVASTATING STRUGGLE FOR POWER ERUPTED IN THE BRITISH ISLES ALONG CATHOLIC VERSUS PROTESTANT LINES. WHEN HE STARTED HIS ANGLICAN CHURCH, KING HENRY VIII HAD CONFISCATED MUCH OF THE WEALTH OF THE MONASTERIES, RESTRICTED THE PRACTICE OF CATHOLICISM, AND PUNISHED LOYALTY TO THE POPE. NOW THAT BOTH HE AND HIS MALE HEIR WERE DEAD, HIS DEVOUTLY CATHOLIC DAUGHTER MARY BECAME QUEEN OF ENGLAND, AND SHE AGGRESSIVELY REVERSED THESE POLICIES, GOING EVEN FURTHER AND BURNING THOUSANDS OF PROTESTANTS AT THE STAKE. SIX YEARS LATER, MARY FELL ILL AND DIED, AND HER SISTER ELIZABETH I BECAME QUEEN. PROTESTANT FORCES CONTINUED TO GAIN POWER AND CONTROL THROUGHOUT THE BRITISH ISLES UNDER ELIZABETH'S LONG REIGN. AFRAID OF HER ARCHRIVAL, THE CATHOLIC KINGDOM OF SPAIN, AND A POSSIBLE INVASION ATTEMPT LAUNCHED FROM IRELAND, ELIZABETH SENT EVEN MORE ENGLISH SETTLERS TO IRELAND, AND HER GENERALS FOUGHT A BRUTAL NINE-YEAR WAR AGAINST IRELAND'S LEADING EARLS. SHE THEN FORCED THEM TO SIGN A TREATY STATING THAT THEY WOULD BE RULED BY ENGLISH LAW AND NOT IRISH LAW, OR EVEN MORE OF THEIR LANDS WOULD BE CONFISCATED. MANY EARLS FLED SOUTH, LOOKING FOR SUPPORT FROM CATHOLIC SPAIN. AND WHEN HER NEPHEW JAMES, A STAUNCH PROTESTANT, SUCCEEDED HER AS THE NEW KING OF ENGLAND, HE BEGAN PERSECUTING EVEN MORE AGGRESSIVELY THOSE LEADERS OF IRELAND WHO REMAINED LOYAL TO THEIR CATHOLIC FAITH. IN 1609, THE LANDS OF MANY LEADING IRISH-CATHOLIC FAMILIES IN NORTHERN IRELAND WERE TAKEN AND GRANTED TO SCOTTISH AND ENGLISH SETTLERS. THIS MASSIVE LAND GRAB BECAME KNOWN AS THE PLANTATION OF ULSTER. IN 1642, A CIVIL WAR ERUPTED IN ENGLAND, AND AT THE SAME TIME, A POPULAR REBELLION OF THOSE OPPOSING BRITISH RULE BEGAN IN NORTHERN IRELAND, THE ULSTER REBELLION. MORE THAN 3,000 PROTESTANT CITIZENS WERE KILLED. THEN, IN 1649, THE VICTOR OF THE CIVIL WAR IN ENGLAND, OLIVER CROMWELL, LANDED ON IRISH SOIL WITH AN ARMY OF HIS OWN AND SLAUGHTERED ALMOST THREE-AND-A-HALF THOUSAND OF THE CATHOLIC CITIZENS OF DROGHEDA IN JUST ONE DAY. HIS BRUTAL CRACKDOWN ROLLED ACROSS THE COUNTRYSIDE AND THE ULSTER REBELLION ENDED. YET, IN ITS WAKE, THE PEOPLE OF NORTHERN IRELAND FOUND THEMSELVES EVEN MORE BITTERLY DIVIDED. THE NEXT 200 YEARS WERE A PERIOD OF EMPIRE-BUILDING FOR ENGLAND. AT ITS HEIGHT, THE BRITISH EMPIRE HELD SWAY OVER 23% OF THE WORLD'S POPULATION, AND 24% OF THE EARTH'S TOTAL LAND AREA. ENGLAND HAD CREATED THE LARGEST EMPIRE IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. IN IRELAND, THE BRITISH RULERS CONTINUED TO OPPOSE GIVING CATHOLICS THE ABILITY TO VOTE OR TO HOLD OFFICE. IN 1801, THE ACT OF UNION WAS PASSED, AND IRELAND WAS OFFICIALLY DECLARED TO BE A PART OF THE UNITED KINGDOM. THE IRISH PARLIAMENT WAS ABOLISHED AND THE PROTESTANT ANGLICAN CHURCH WAS DESIGNATED BY LAW AS THE OFFICIAL CHURCH OF IRELAND. BETWEEN 1845 AND 1849, FAILED POTATO CROPS CAUSED DEVASTATION IN IRELAND, LEADING TO WIDESPREAD STARVATION, MASSIVE EMIGRATION, AND THE DEATH OF OVER 1 MILLION PEOPLE. THE FACT THAT THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT DID SO LITTLE TO HELP THE PEOPLE OF IRELAND AT THIS TIME FUELED THE DESIRE OF MANY PEOPLE LIVING IN IRELAND FOR A GOVERNMENT OF THEIR OWN. THE EASTER UPRISING OF 1916 OPENED THE FLOODGATES TO CHANGE. PRESSURE FOR THE CREATION OF AN INDEPENDENT NATION CALLED IRELAND PROVED TOO POWERFUL TO OVERCOME. IN 1921, ENGLAND NEGOTIATED A COMPROMISE, ONE THAT ALLOWED A FREE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND IN THE SOUTH, BUT WHICH ALSO RETAINED TIGHT CONTROL OVER NORTHERN IRELAND, WHICH REMAINED A PART OF THE BRITISH EMPIRE. POLITICIANS ELECTED BY THE PROTESTANT MAJORITY IN NORTHERN IRELAND PASSED THE SPECIAL POWERS ACT, ALLOWING THEM TO TAKE SWIFT AND AGGRESSIVE ACTION AGAINST ANY CATHOLICS WHO PUSHED FOR EQUALITY, REFORM, OR UNION WITH THE SOUTH. THE STAGE WAS SET FOR THE NEXT 60 YEARS OF LOW PAY, POOR HOUSING, AND LACK OF POLITICAL RIGHTS THAT WOULD FINALLY BRING NORTHERN IRELAND TO THE BRINK OF CIVIL WAR. AND THE WOMEN SUFFERED THE WORST OF THAT, TOO. ALL OF IT FALLS ON THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN. [NARRATOR] TO BEGIN TO BREAK DOWN CENTURIES OF DIVISION, HATRED, AND MISTRUST, THE PEACE PEOPLE FOCUSED ON WOMEN HELPING WOMEN, ESPECIALLY AFTER ONE OF THEIR CHILDREN WAS KILLED, A TIME OF TOTAL DEVASTATION. [WILLIAMS] THAT'S WHAT WAR DOES TO AN INDIVIDUAL WOMAN. IT DESTROYS EVERYTHING AROUND IT, INCLUDING THE MENTALITY OF THE LOSS. [NARRATOR] PROTESTANT AND CATHOLIC WOMEN BEGAN CALLING ON EACH OTHER AT THEIR HOMES IN FRIENDSHIP AND SUPPORT. [WILLIAMS] A LOT OF THEM WOULD ACTUALLY GET ON A BUS, BECAUSE THE BUS WASN'T EXPENSIVE, AND MAKE A CAKE AND TAKE IT AND THEN SHE WOULD FORM FRIENDSHIPS WITH THE FAMILY OF THE BEREAVED. THERE WERE LINKS THAT NEVER WERE BROKEN, AND THEY DID IT EN MASSE. [WOMAN] THE NORWEGIAN NOBEL COMMITTEE DECIDED TO HONOR TWO WOMEN TODAY FOR FEARLESSLY TACKLING THE PERILOUS TASK OF WORKING FOR PEACE IN NORTHERN IRELAND, SAYING, "WHAT THEY HAVE DONE IS AN EXAMPLE TO THE WORLD." BETTY WILLIAMS AND MAIREAD CORRIGAN STARTED THEIR MOVEMENT FOR PEACE AFTER THE TRAGIC DEATH OF THREE YOUNG CHILDREN IN NORTHERN IRELAND, AND THEY HAVE INSPIRED HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS TO PLEDGE FOR PEACE IN THEIR HOME COUNTRY. TODAY'S NOBEL PRIZE CEREMONY MARKED THE CULMINATION OF 16 MONTHS OF TIRELESS WORK IN HOPE OF SETTING NORTHERN IRELAND ON A NEW PATHWAY FORWARD. BUT THE VOICE OF WOMEN, THE VOICE OF THOSE MOST CLOSELY INVOLVED IN BRINGING FORTH NEW LIFE, HAS NOT ALWAYS BEEN LISTENED TO WHEN IT PLEADED AND IMPLORED AGAINST THE WASTE OF LIFE IN WAR AFTER WAR AFTER WAR. THE VOICE OF WOMEN HAS A SPECIAL ROLE AND A SPECIAL SOUL FORCE IN THE STRUGGLE FOR A NONVIOLENT WORLD. [APPLAUSE] [NARRATOR] BY THE END OF 1977, ALMOST 100 DIFFERENT PEACE GROUPS HAD FORMED ACROSS NORTHERN IRELAND, FOCUSED ON BREAKING DOWN THE BARRIERS OF HATE AND BUILDING BRIDGES OF FRIENDSHIP AND SUPPORT IN THEIR OWN COMMUNITIES. THE ANNUAL DEATH TOLL FROM THE TROUBLES WAS CUT IN HALF, AND IT NEVER RETURNED TO PRE-1976 LEVELS. THAT WAS A TRANSFORMATION, AND IT CAME FROM THE WOMEN. I KNOW WE SAVED LIVES. [NARRATOR] THE PEACE PEOPLE CREATED TEAMS OF WOMEN WHO WOULD ARRIVE AT THE SITE OF BOMBINGS WITHIN MINUTES TO HELP FAMILIES WHO WERE SEARCHING FOR THEIR LOVED ONES. IN FEBRUARY OF 1978, THE LA MON HOUSE RESTAURANT WAS BOMBED, AND 12 PEOPLE WERE KILLED. [NEWSCASTER] TEN PEOPLE ARE STILL IN HOSPITAL, THREE IN SERIOUS CONDITION WITH MASSIVE BURNS. THE RESTAURANT WAS ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR SPOTS FOR BELFAST CITIZENS WHO HAD BEEN AVOIDING CITY CENTER RESTAURANTS AND PUBS FOR FEAR OF BOMB ATTACKS THERE. THE LEADER OF THE PEACE WOMEN, MRS. BETTY WILLIAMS, WAS AT THE RESTAURANT WITHIN MINUTES OF THE EXPLOSION. WHAT SORT OF SCENE MET YOUR EYES AT THE LA MON LAST NIGHT? WELL, IT WAS STILL ABLAZE AND THE FIRE APPLIANCES WERE THERE AND CARS WERE LINED FOR, I'D SAY, A GOOD HALF A MILE WITH PEOPLE WHO HAD PEOPLE GOING TO LA MON HOUSE LAST NIGHT WONDERING WHETHER THEY WERE INSIDE OR WHETHER THEY GOT OUT SAFELY. IT WAS UTTER DESTRUCTION. [NARRATOR] THEY ALSO BROUGHT PROTESTANT AND CATHOLIC CHILDREN TOGETHER FOR HOLIDAYS IN THE NORTH SO THAT THEY COULD LEARN TO KNOW EACH OTHER AND SO THAT THEY COULD ESCAPE THE CONTINUING VIOLENCE. PEOPLE WOULD SEND MONEY AND ALL FROM AMERICA AND BRING THE CHILDREN, RIGHT, AND GIVE THEM A GREAT TIME, BUT THEN THE CHILDREN WOULD HAVE TO COME HOME TO THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT THEY'D LEFT IN THE FIRST PLACE. SISTER ANNA AND I GOT TOGETHER. SHE WAS AN ANGLICAN NUN AND HER BELIEF WAS LIKE MINE. WE MUST EDUCATE THE CHILDREN TOGETHER. [NARRATOR] SISTER ANNA WAS PART OF A GROUP THAT WAS STRUGGLING TO OPEN THE VERY FIRST INTEGRATED SCHOOL EVER IN NORTHERN IRELAND, DESPITE STRONG OPPOSITION FROM THE CATHOLIC CHURCH AND MOST PROTESTANT AND CATHOLIC PARENTS. [WILLIAMS] MY DEBRA WAS ONE OF THE FIRST PEOPLE, AND HER WEE FRIEND LISA, UP THE STREET, MY FRIEND GERALDINE'S LITTLE GIRL 'CAUSE WE KNEW WE COULD BEGIN TO GET OUR CHILDREN TOGETHER. IN FACT, ONE WEE FELLOW SAID, "THE ONLY REASON I'M COMING TO THIS SCHOOL IS TO FIGHT WITH CATHOLICS," BUT HE FELL IN LOVE WITH WEE MARY IN THE THIRD ROW, SO THAT WAS FINE. BY THE SECOND DAY, THAT WAS ALL CURED. HE FORMED A FRIENDSHIP WITH MARY AND THAT SAVED THE WHOLE THING. THAT'S THE KIND OF THING WE DID. WE JUST-- YOU TOOK THAT CHANCE. [NEWSCASTER] IT IS SUMMERTIME IN NORTHERN IRELAND, WHICH MEANS THAT THE PROTESTANTS' DOMINATION OF NORTHERN IRELAND IS BEING PARADED THROUGH THE STREETS OF EVERY TOWN ONCE AGAIN IN THE ORANGE DAY MARCHES, WHICH CELEBRATES THE ANNIVERSARIES OF FAMOUS PROTESTANT VICTORIES OVER CATHOLICS IN IRELAND'S VIOLENT PAST. YOU KNOW, THAT HISTORY GOES BACK 850 YEARS, SINCE THE INVASION OF CROMWELL, BUT I THINK WE SHOWED, TOO, THAT THE NORTHERN IRISH PEOPLE DIDN'T WANNA LIVE LIKE THAT ANYMORE. IT WAS LIKE BIG JOHN. THE NEXT TIME I SAW HIM, HE GOT IN THE CAR, AND I SAID, "DO YOU LIKE DRIVING?" AND HE SAID, "OH, I LOVE DRIVING." I SAID, "WELL--" I PULLED OVER. I SAID, "WOULD YOU LIKE TO DRIVE ME? AND HE FELL IN LOVE WITH THE CAR. FELL IN LOVE WITH DEBBIE, AND HE STARTED TO HAVE HIS DINNER AT OUR HOUSE, AND ONE NIGHT, OVER A COUPLE OF DRINKS, HE JUST STARTED TO TALK AND WE TALKED FOR FOUR, MAYBE FIVE HOURS. I WAS IN BITS BY THE END OF IT, AND HE WAS IN WORSE BITS. AND SOME OF THE THINGS JOHN HAD DONE WERE SO SOUL-DESTROYING, YOU KNOW, THAT IT WAS SO HARD FOR HIM. AND EVER SINCE THAT HE JUST BECAME PART OF THE FAMILY. AT NIGHT HE WOULD MAKE SURE I WAS OKAY AND THE CHILDREN WERE OKAY. MY MUMMY AND DADDY ADORED HIM. HE'D COME AT CHRISTMAS AS FATHER CHRISTMAS. HE STARTED GOING TO THE NAZARETH LODGE, ORPHANAGE, DOING FATHER CHRISTMAS THERE. YOU KNOW, HE JUST STARTED DOING REALLY GORGEOUS STUFF. THAT SHOWS YOU THAT ANYBODY CAN BE BROUGHT BACK FROM VIOLENCE. [NARRATOR] AS 1979 COMES TO A CLOSE, SEVERAL MORE EXPLOSIONS AND DEATHS OCCURRED IN COUNTY TYRONE AND COUNTY ARMAGH DUE TO TERRORIST ACTIONS BY THE PROVISIONAL I.R.A. [NARRATOR] BETTY'S MARRIAGE STARTED TO SUFFER FROM THE CONSTANT STRESS AND TRAVEL, THE CONSTANT HARASSMENT FROM BOTH THE PROVISIONAL I.R.A. AND THE PROTESTANT PARAMILITARY GROUPS AND FROM CRITICISM AND PRESSURE WITHIN THE PEACE MOVEMENT ITSELF OVER HOW THE FUNDS SHOULD BE SPENT AND WHETHER THEY SHOULD BECOME MORE POLITICAL. [WILLIAMS] I DON'T THINK THERE ARE MANY COUPLES JUST AS HAPPY AS MY MOTHER AND FATHER WERE. I WISH I COULD'VE FOUND THAT IN MY OWN RELATIONSHIPS. I NEVER WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO FIND THAT PERSON THAT WAS JUST RIGHT. [NARRATOR] BETTY'S MOTHER HAD AN ANEURISM AND A STROKE AND BECAME PARALYZED ON ONE SIDE WHEN BETTY WAS 13 YEARS OLD. [WILLIAMS] IT WAS A NATURAL THING FOR ME TO LOOK AFTER MY MOTHER. I DIDN'T FEEL IT WAS A SACRIFICE OR ANY OF THAT. BUT THEN I CAN REMEMBER SOMEBODY SAYING TO MY DADDY ONE DAY, "GEORDIE, LOOK, YOU HAVE A TERRIBLE CROSS TO CARRY," JUST REFERRING TO MY MOTHER. AND MY DADDY SAID, "I'M NOT CARRYING THE CROSS. MY WIFE IS. I'M JUST HELPING HER UP THE HILL WITH IT." HOW MANY OTHER MEN WOULD LOOK AT IT THAT WAY? JUST AN AMAZING MAN FOR THE WAY HE LOVED MY MOTHER. IT WAS PURE LOVE. [NARRATOR] IN 1980, BETTY'S MARRIAGE ENDED, AND SHE LEFT THE PEACE PEOPLE. [WILLIAMS] AFTER I'D LEFT THE PEACE MOVEMENT, GOT A RECREATION CENTER BUILT AT THE MARKETS. WE'D BE DOWN AT THE CITY HALL. WE DID DOOR-KNOCKING CAMPAIGNS IN THIS AREA BECAUSE THAT WAS ONE OF THE WORST HOUSING CONDITIONS IN WESTERN EUROPE, WAS WHERE JOHN LIVED. AND HE SLIPPED INTO THE ROLE OF PEACEMAKER. HE COULD GET THINGS DONE, AND SO WE ABSOLUTELY TORTURED CITY COUNCIL. THEY WERE SICK OF US, YOU KNOW? AND THEY FINALLY, FINALLY APPROVED A BUILDING. [NEWSCASTER] CONSTRUCTION WILL BEGIN NEXT MONTH ON A LONG-AWAITED HOUSING RENEWAL PROGRAM, THE SUBSTANDARD HOUSING BEING REPLACED WITH FLATS, BOASTING INDOOR PLUMBING, HEAT, AND ELECTRICITY. THE MARKETS AREA OF BELFAST HAS LONG BEEN THE CENTER OF VIOLENCE AND TERRORIST ACTIVITY EVER SINCE THE START OF THE TROUBLES. [WILLIAMS] PEOPLE GOT NICE HOMES WITH INDOOR BATHROOMS, ENOUGH BEDROOMS, AND A RECREATION CENTER WAS PART OF THAT. AND WE HAD THEN A WEE FOOTBALL CLUB AND IT STARTED DOWN AT THE MARKETS AREA IN BELFAST WITH BIG JOHN IN CHARGE OF IT, AND WE BOUGHT THEM THEIR WEE UNIFORMS AND ALL AND OFF THEY WENT PLAYING TOGETHER. YOU COULD ACTUALLY SEE THAT CHANGE. I MEAN, IT WASN'T JUST ME THAT COULD SEE THAT CHANGE. SOCIETY GENERALLY COULD SEE THAT CHANGE BECAUSE THEN THE MOTHERS WOULD BE COMING IN MINIBUSES, AND THE INTERACTION WOULD BE MOTHERS COLLECTING AND DELIVERING CHILDREN AND HAVING A CUP OF TEA TOGETHER BECAUSE THE CHILDREN WERE PLAYING. WE REALIZED, AS FEMALES, WE HAD MUCH MORE IN COMMON THAN WE EVER WOULD HAVE TO DIVIDE US, AND THE IN COMMON WAS OUR OFFSPRING. [NARRATOR] IN 1981, BETTY STARTED TO HEAR ABOUT FAMINE AND A GROWING CRISIS IN AFRICA. AND I USED TO WATCH TELEVISION LIKE EVERYBODY'D DONE, AND YOU'D SEE CHILDREN IN DISTRESS, IN NEED AND STARVING. HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF CHILDREN GOING TO DIE BECAUSE THEY HADN'T GOT ENOUGH TO EAT. IT'S GROSSLY UNFAIR FOR A CHILD TO BE CONDEMNED TO DEATH AT BIRTH, AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT'S HAPPENING. THEY ARE CONDEMNED TO DEATH THE INSTANT THEY ARE BORN. THEY GET NO CHANCE. THERE'S NO FAIRNESS, THERE'S NO JUSTICE, THERE'S NO NOTHING. THEY'RE JUST CONDEMNED TO DEATH. [NEWSCASTER] THE HUNGRY FACE OF AFRICA. OVER THE PAST YEAR, THE OUTSIDE WORLD HAS SLOWLY BECOME AWARE OF THE HUMAN TRAGEDY UNFOLDING ON THIS CONTINENT. 15 MILLION PEOPLE ARE THREATENED. IT'S A CRISIS CAUSED BY PROLONGED DROUGHT, FOOD SHORTAGES, BORDER CONFLICTS, AND REFUGEES, AND IT'S STILL GOING ON. AT THIS WATER HOLE IN SOUTHERN ETHIOPIA, THE WOMEN MUST DIG DOWN EIGHT TO TEN METERS EVERY DAY TO GET WATER. FOR EVERYTHING ELSE, THEY DEPEND ON OUTSIDE HELP. [WILLIAMS] NORTHERN IRELAND IS SO VASTLY DIFFERENT. WE KILLED OUR CHILDREN WITH GUNS, BUT WE DIDN'T STARVE THEM. WE CERTAINLY DIDN'T STARVE THEM. [NARRATOR] BETTY VOLUNTEERED TO FLY TO AFRICA AS PART OF AN OFFICIAL DELEGATION BRINGING DESPERATELY NEEDED FOOD AND MEDICAL SUPPLIES. [WILLIAMS] I WAS IN A VILLAGE. WE HAD BROUGHT A LOAD OF SUPPLIES OUT WITH US THAT WERE NEARLY FINISHED. IN THE VILLAGE THAT I WAS IN, THERE WAS VERY LITTLE THERE. THAT KIND OF SUFFERING IN THE WORLD, WHY DO WE PUT UP WITH THAT? I MEAN, WHY IS THAT ALLOWED TO HAPPEN IN A WORLD THAT CAN FEED ITSELF? AND, YOU KNOW, WHEN A BABY'S DYING OF MALNUTRITION, THE TUMMY IS ALL DISTENDED AND SWOLLEN, BUT THE SKULL IS THE HEAVIEST BONE IN THE HEAD, AND SO THEY CAN'T HOLD THEIR WEE HEADS UP, AND THEIR EYES BECOME ENORMOUS BECAUSE THEIR LITTLE FACE HAS BECOME SMALLER. AND YOU HAVE TO SUPPORT THE HEAD, YOU KNOW? AND MAYBE IT'S JUST ME, BUT EVERY TIME I'VE HELD A CHILD LIKE THAT WHO'S DYING... IT SEEMS TO BE THAT THEY'RE ASKING YOU WHY. THOSE WEE EYES ARE LOOKING UP AT YOU. AND MAYBE THAT'S NOT WHAT THEY'RE ASKING YOU. MAYBE THAT'S ONLY MY TAKE ON IT, BUT I ALWAYS ASK THEM TO FORGIVE US FOR WHAT WE'VE DONE. [NARRATOR] THE TRIP BECAME A TURNING POINT IN BETTY'S LIFE. SHE DECIDED TO ACCEPT A TEACHING POSITION AT SAM HOUSTON STATE UNIVERSITY IN THE USA AND TO DEDICATE THE REST OF HER LIFE TO FIGHTING FOR THE LIVES OF ALL CHILDREN ALL AROUND THE WORLD. [WILLIAMS] I DON'T KNOW HOW ANYONE CAN WITNESS THE DEATH OF A CHILD AND NOT BE AFFECTED BY IT, AND THAT WAS THE CATALYST TO THE WORK THAT I'M DOING NOW. AND RIGHT NOW WE'RE IN A TOWN OUTSIDE MOSCOW. I WISH THAT EVERY CHILD IN THE WORLD HAD SOMEWHERE SAFE TO LIVE. THAT'S MY GREATEST WISH, THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE ORPHANS AND WE DIDN'T HAVE THE DESTRUCTION OF WAR, WHICH REALLY IS SOMETHING A CHILD CAN'T UNDERSTAND. A CHILD CANNOT DECLARE WAR, YET THEY'RE CAUGHT UP IN WARS. MY GREATEST WISH IS FOR EVERY CHILD TO BE SAFE. SO THE ANSWER IS VERY SHORT. I WORK FOR CHILDREN. THE WORST UNHAPPINESS THAT I SUFFER FROM IS WHEN I GO OUT IN THE WORLD AND SEE THE CONDITIONS THAT THE CHILDREN ARE FORCED TO LIVE UNDER. MY LIFE AND MY WORK ARE ONE. THEY'RE BLENDED TOGETHER. WHAT MAKES LIFE UNLIVABLE IS THE SUFFERING OF CHILDREN. I FIND THAT GROTESQUE. MY QUESTION FOR MANKIND WOULD HAVE TO BE, "WHY HAVE WE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO LEARN TO LIVE TOGETHER AS ONE HUMAN FAMILY AND NOT ALL AS DIVIDED TRIBES? WHY DO WE DESTROY CHILDREN?" [NARRATOR] 1998 WAS A VERY IMPORTANT YEAR IN NORTHERN IRELAND. THE TORTUROUS PATHWAY TO PEACE FINALLY PREVAILED. A POWER-SHARING AGREEMENT BETWEEN PROTESTANTS AND CATHOLICS WAS HAMMERED OUT BRINGING AN END TO THE 30 YEARS OF SECTARIAN CONFLICT KNOWN AS THE TROUBLES, AND IT WAS SIGNED IN APRIL. IT WAS CALLED THE GOOD FRIDAY AGREEMENT. SOME WAY, THE NORTHERN IRISH PEACE WOMEN-- AND I'VE GOTTA KEEP SAYING THAT. WE ALWAYS FORGET, IT'S THE WOMEN WHO HAVE DONE THIS IN NORTHERN IRELAND-- I THINK THEY TURNED THAT CARD. BECAUSE ONCE THEY STARTED RUNNING WITH IT, HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF WOMEN THAT'S RAW COURAGE, INCREDIBLY CONTAGIOUS. [NARRATOR] AND BETTY BEGAN WORKING IN EARNEST ON A NEW, IMPOSSIBLE DREAM: CREATING WORLD CENTERS OF COMPASSION FOR CHILDREN. [WILLIAMS] WELL, I HAD BEEN GOING ABOUT WITH THIS IDEA IN MY HEAD FOR A GOOD 30 YEARS. THERE'S NO REASON WHY WE CAN'T BUILD CITIES OF PEACE FOR CHILDREN. I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE IT WOULD BE. AND THEN MY VERY GOOD FRIEND, WHO COMES FROM THE REGION BASILICATA, TOLD ME ABOUT THEM WANTING TO DUMP NUCLEAR WASTE ON THE LAND, AND THAT THE PEOPLE WERE OUT IN THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS PROTESTING, SO I IMMEDIATELY CAME DOWN AND JOINED THEM. THIS IS A PART OF ITALY WHICH IS-- SOMETIMES IT REMINDS ME OF IRELAND. THE PEOPLE HERE ARE VERY PASSIONATE. YOU KNOW, THEY'RE PASSIONATE ABOUT THE LAND. THEY'RE PASSIONATE ABOUT THEIR HOMES. AND I MUST SAY, THE WOMEN OF BASILICATA, THEY'RE MAGNIFICENT BECAUSE THEY WERE THE BULK OF THE PEOPLE THAT WERE OUT PROTESTING THE DUMPING OF NUCLEAR WASTE. [NARRATOR] AFTER YEARS AND YEARS OF PROTESTS, LOBBYING, AND BUREAUCRACY, BETTY AND THE PEOPLE OF BASILICATA FINALLY PREVAILED, AND THEY WERE ALLOWED TO USE THE LAND FOR A NEW PROJECT, FOCUSED ON LIFE INSTEAD OF DEATH. WITH HELP FROM THE DALAI LAMA, SHARON STONE, AND SO MANY OTHERS, BETTY HAD FOUND THE PLACE FOR HER FIRST WORLD CENTER OF COMPASSION FOR CHILDREN. WELL, TODAY'S A REALLY EXCITING DAY BECAUSE IT'S 16 YEARS OF WORK, AND TODAY WE'RE ACTUALLY BEGINNING THE BUILDING OF THE HOUSES. AND IT'S INCREDIBLE BECAUSE EVERYTHING ECOLOGICALLY IS ALMOST SELF-SUSTAINING. AND THEY'LL ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO SELL ELECTRICITY TO THE GRID. I MEAN, IT'S JUST STATE OF THE ART. IT HASN'T BEEN EASY TO GETTING TO WHERE WE'VE GOTTEN, WITH ALL THE BUREAUCRACY AND EVERYTHING THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE TO ASSURE THAT YOU CAN BE THERE. ONCE YOU'RE IN, ONCE THAT FIRST HOUSE IS BUILT, YOU'RE SET IN CONCRETE, AND THAT'S WHAT WE'LL BE. [NARRATOR] TODAY, THE CORNERSTONE FOR THE VERY FIRST BUILDING WILL BE LAID DOWN. IT'S NOT JUST FOR ITALY. WE'RE GOING TO BE BUILDING IN GHANA. WE'RE GOING TO BE BUILDING IN CHILE. SO THE MODEL IS BEING CREATED OF HOW WE TREAT OUR DISENFRANCHISED BROTHERS AND SISTERS. WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO HELP 300 FAMILIES SO FAR. I AM "AMMA DUDRAME" FROM THE GAMBIA. [NARRATOR] THEY HAVE BEEN HELPED WITH HOUSING, EDUCATION, AND TRAINING AS THEY SETTLE INTO LIFE IN THE BASILICATA REGION OF ITALY. SO I'LL KEEP WORKING FOR YOU WHILE I HAVE BREATH. I LOVE YOU GUYS. WE LOVE YOU, TOO. I'LL SEE YOU AGAIN SOON. BYE, DARLINGS. BYE. THANK YOU. OH, THE PEOPLE BASILICATA, THEY LOVE BABIES. WHEN WE FIRST BROUGHT THE FAMILIES HERE, THERE WAS AN OLD GRANDMOTHER, ONE OF THE HOUSES WE WERE REDOING TO PUT THE FAMILY IN, AND SHE SAID, "IT'LL BE SO LOVELY TO HEAR CHILDREN LAUGH AND SING AND PLAY. WE HAVEN'T SEEN THAT FOR YEARS." IT'S HARD TO TELL YOU WHAT MY EMOTIONS ARE RIGHT NOW BECAUSE EVERY BAD TIME DURING THE 16 YEARS HAS BEEN WORTH IT, AND WE'VE HAD A LOT OF HICCUPS AND BAD TIMES, BUT NOW WE HAVE THE BUILDINGS, THE ACTUAL BUILDINGS, SO IT'S VERY SPECIAL. IT'S NOW MY HONOR TO GIVE THE FLOOR TO MS. BETTY WILLIAMS, WHO IS THE 1976 NOBEL PEACE LAUREATE AND WORLD-ACCLAIMED ADVOCATE FOR CHILDREN. YOU HAVE THE FLOOR, MADAM. I MADE A PROMISE ON THE STREETS OF BELFAST TO THOSE CHILDREN THAT I WOULD FIGHT FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE THAT THEY DID NOT DIE IN VAIN. I WOULD GET INVITATIONS TO GO ALL OVER THE WORLD-- ETHIOPIA, CAMBODIA, AFGHANISTAN, NICARAGUA, CHILE, ARGENTINA, RUSSIA... AND I COULDN'T BELIEVE WHAT I WAS SEEING. ONE OF MY JOURNEYS TOOK ME TO BURMA. I MET TWO BEAUTIFUL LITTLE GIRLS. I WAS HOLDING THEM IN MY ARMS. THEY WERE HOLDING ME LIKE I WAS THEIR MOTHER. THEIR STORY, TWO LITTLE GIRLS, HAD TO WATCH THEIR MOTHER AND FATHER DIG A GRAVE. THEY HAD TO WATCH WHEN SLORC SOLDIERS BLEW THEM APART, THEIR HEADS. THEY THEN HAD TO FILL IN THE GRAVE, AND WERE TAKEN BY THE SLORC SOLDIERS TO CARRY THE WEAPONS. FOR THE GIRLS, IT WAS AN ABSOLUTE NIGHTMARE. THEY WOULD TIE THEM TO TREES AND SYSTEMATICALLY RAPE THEM. WHEN I SAID TO ONE OF THE CHILDREN, "DO YOU REMEMBER ANY OF THE MEN WHO DID THIS TO YOU?" AND SHE SAID, "ONLY THE FIRST ONE." I GET VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT MY WORK. AND IF YOU WERE IN THE S-- LIKE I DO, WHEN YOU SEE IT UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL-- I TRIED TO WRITE A SPEECH COMING HERE. I THOUGHT IT WAS REALLY-- "GOD, I'M GONNA BE AT THE UNITED NATIONS. I SHOULD WRITE A SPEECH." I COULDN'T WRITE IT BECAUSE I KEPT CRYING. I HAD TO BRING TO MIND ALL THE THINGS THAT I WITNESSED. IT IS TIME TO ALLOW THE CHILDREN A VOICE. THIS IS THE UNIVERSAL DECLARATION OF THE RIGHTS OF CHILDREN. WE, THE CHILDREN OF THE WORLD, ASSERT OUR INALIENABLE RIGHT TO BE HEARD AND TO HAVE A POLITICAL VOICE AT THE UNITED NATIONS AND AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF GOVERNMENTS WORLDWIDE. WE, THE CHILDREN OF THE WORLD, MUST LIVE WITH JUSTICE, WITH PEACE, AND FREEDOM. BUT ABOVE ALL, WITH THE DIGNITY WE DESERVE. WE, THE CHILDREN OF THE WORLD, HAVE HAD NO POLITICAL VOICE. WE DEMAND SUCH A VOICE. AND, LASTLY, WE, THE CHILDREN OF THE WORLD, SERVE NOTICE ON OUR ABUSERS AND EXPLOITERS, WHOEVER THEY MAY BE, THAT FROM THIS DAY HENCE, WE WILL BEGIN THE PROCESS OF HOLDING YOU RESPONSIBLE FOR OUR SUFFERING. [WILLIAMS] I'VE SEEN THE BEST OF HUMANKIND, BUT I'VE ALSO SEEN THE WORST. FEAR IS VERY CONTAGIOUS. IT CRIPPLED ME, PERSONALLY CRIPPLED ME FOR MANY YEARS, AND I OFTEN WONDER WHY I DID NOT SPEAK OUT SOONER. WHY DID IT HAVE TO BE THAT THOSE WEE BABIES HAD TO DIE? WHY COULDN'T I HAVE DONE THIS SOONER? I BLAME MYSELF FOR THAT IN A LOT OF WAYS 'CAUSE, YOU KNOW, WHEN I LOOK BACK ON THAT IN RETROSPECT, IT TOOK THAT INCIDENT TO BREAK MY FEAR AND TO SAY, "WE'RE CRIPPLED HERE WITH THIS FEAR." 'CAUSE I KNOW-- 'CAUSE I HAD IT. BUT IT'S NOT JUST MY STORY. HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF WOMEN WERE BETTY WILLIAMS. ONCE YOU SEE COURAGE WALKING, COURAGE ON LEGS, IT'S JUST AMAZING. TO BE HONEST, I THINK COURAGE IS MUCH MORE CONTAGIOUS THAN FEAR ONCE A PERSON GETS IT, 'CAUSE NONVIOLENCE IS THE WEAPON OF THE STRONG. [MUSIC PLAYING]
