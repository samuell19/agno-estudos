You mean those kids on the track team. What do you know about them? Inspector. Today is graduation day. Those kids are being kicked out of the nest sort of speed. From now on it's fly or fall on their own. They are probably just out raising the hell. Why, why? There parents so upset? That's, that's what I don't understand. Neither do I. That's why I'm here. Hey chief. What's the good word? Where's your badge? I must have lost it. Here's a list of home rooms, check them out. Alright. - Got you covered. - What if they're not there? Then you write in your report, "not there". Should I look for them? No. McGregor. We are here to make a report. That's all. About a bunch of inconsiderate irresponsible kids... About to fly out of their nest and shit all over the rest of us. Alright. So make it and let's go. I get closter phobic just being around schools. That's a good one. Impressive. Isn't it? It's too bad about coach Michaels. Yes it is. It is a pity. He was a fine coach. But that's the way it is in public life. You're only as good as you last mistake. Sobering thought. Isn't it? - How is your report coming? - I'm working on it. Coach Michaels. I'm Inspector Halliday. Six seniors didn't make it home last night. Would you know anything about them? No. You didn't see anything, you didn't hear anything. There's nothing you can tell me? No. They were all on your track team. I don't have a team. How do you mean that? In case you hadn't heard, I've been canned. I heard. Good. If you'll excuse me, anything else I have to finish packing. Sure. I'll see you at the graduation ceremonies.
