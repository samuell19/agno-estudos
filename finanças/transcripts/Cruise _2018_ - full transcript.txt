Those are the Big Three, okay? BMWs come factory with Blaupunkt. So if you see a Beemer, there's gonna be a Blaupunkt inside. Same with Mercedes and the Becker. So those are the two you look for? Not necessarily. I mean, they're worth a lot, but they're kind of a pain in the ass. You gotta rip 'em out, wires and all. Benzis, you just grab and go. - The pull-outs. - Yeah. Exactly. Don't people normally take those with them? Nine times out of ten, they're under the seat. So Benzi's the way to go. But you don't know what you're gonna get. Bust into a Saab with a hole in the dash, there could be a Kenwood under the driver's seat or it could be some piece-of-shit Delco. Fuckin' radio roulette. Do nice cars ever have shit radios? Oh, all the time. And the reverse. You could see some piece of shit Gremlin with a Nakamichi in it. Nakamichi, that's good? That's the magic purple unicorn. This is wild. So, like, how do you break in? Metal bar. Slips right in the door. - You don't smash the window? - That's for amateurs. - What if an alarm goes off? - You run. - Have you ever been caught? - Never. - Would you go to jail? - Not for long.

Gio: Yeah, sure, I'm sure. Jessica: Anyway-- - Look, uh... Yeah? Gio: Ah, nothin'. - What? Gio: No. Never mind. Jessica: What? Tell me. I just, uh, I just I had a little idea. What kind of an idea? I was wondering if maybe you wanted to come along on something a little more interesting. You know, one last little adventure before you shuffle off. Jessica: Such as? Uh, stealing a car. Jessica: A car? Jessica: You steal cars? - Oh, all the time. Jessica: That sounds kind of... Uh, dangerous? Exciting? What do you say? Little something to shock your buddies back at Brown?

Really, really fun. But, you know... we're just on different tracks. I'm not good enough for your track? - I didn't say that. - What the fu... I'm not fucking good enough for your track? Hey, I did not say that. You know what I think? I don't think this has shit to do with tracks. I think it's because you are a pussy. [laughing] Excuse me? You like to act all Miss Rebel with your Washington Square and your New Order and your little fuckin' art galleries, but deep down, deep down, you're scared. Oh. - I'm scared of what? - Yeah. Of everything. Pissing off your parents, freaking out your friends. You like doing ballsy shit? Huh? Stealing cars, doing blow? I got something real ballsy for you. Date me. Be my fuckin' girlfriend.

It's not your fault. - Actually, it kind of is. - My fault? Gio: The whole stealing the car thing. You invited me. I just came along for one of your runs. Gio: Nah, there was no run. I don't steal cars. I never stole a car in my life. So then... why? I just wanted to see you again. I should go. Get in. Why? Just get in.

Gio: What, this thing can fly. For a V4, it's got some muscle. Jessica: That means you were doing like 110 the entire way. Gio: I wasn't like staring at the speedometer.
