Who are you? What do you want from me? - Your joy. - Your happiness. - Your odious innocence. - Your stubborn faith. No. We will show you what you don't want to see. - You'll hear what you don't want to hear. - You'll know what you want to ignore. No! You can't! Not him! He's so young! Help! Please save him! Help! Not him! He has to live! He has to live! - He's dead. - He's dead. - No! - He's dead. He's dead! The usual nightmare? Yes, and it was worse than normal. It's frightening. And that chant, I can still hear it in my brain. What could that doll represent? It's just a subconscious manifestation of your psyche. - The dream frees you of your anxieties. - But I... - It's reality you should be afraid of. - But what is reality? I am your reality. Isn't that enough, my love? - Where do you find all that security? - In my studies. In a subconscious reality. You'll never understand. You can also lose yourself when you explore the labyrinth of the human psyche. Mr. Schuman. - Esmeralda's going into labour. - Impossible, it's too early. - I'm going to see what's happening. - I'll have a bath and catch up with you. - When did the pains start? - I don't know... Gaetano just arrived and he was asking about you. You should have informed me immediately. 'The first manifestation of the subconscious. ' Good. She'll give birth without feeling any pain now... but I can't leave her hypnotised. You'll have to go to Rome alone. - You'll forgive me, won't you? - It must be great to be pregnant. To hear it coming into the world. Suffering to give it life... and then hear their first screams. There's nothing we can do. He's dead. - He's dead. - He's dead. He's dead. Yes, it must be wonderful to have a baby! Bye, Franz. Don't be long. - Madeleine. - Yes. - Why do you insist on lying? - It's not true, I'm not lying... and you should know that. I'll do anything to have a baby. It's the only way for me to find myself. Is it my fault if I can't have children? Is it my fault if... If... I'm sorry, I didn't mean to... Ubiquity. Schuman household. Hello? Yes, who's speaking? Good morning, sir! I'll get your father, hold on. - Antonio. - Yes? Tell Mr. Schuman, his son is calling from Paris. - Where are you going? - He's in the park. - I thought I saw him in his study. - No, he's in the park. Hurry. Mr. Schuman. Your son is calling from Paris. My God! What are you shouting about? You know I don't want to be disturbed when I'm working. I was conducting a very difficult experiment. I didn't shout, sir. But your son's calling from Paris. My son! Why didn't you tell me? Thanks, Antonio! Yes? Lewis! You won the race and now you're in Paris? - When are you coming to see me? - I was hoping you might come here. What do you say to a wild holiday in Paris? Why not? Another meeting? The usual parapsychology. By the way, how are the experiments going? Sure... It's okay. If it's any consolation, the weather here is terrible! So what? I was prepared to buy you an umbrella! By the way, that camera you gave me is great, you'll love the photos! Yes, I'm getting better than you! It means if I fail as a runner, I'll sell postcards by the Seine! Okay... I'll come there. I'll let you know. Sure, soon! I've really missed you. I can't wait to see you. I'll be waiting. Bye. What's wrong? Changed your mind? - What's your name? - Thomas, and you? Madeleine. Are you American? No, Swiss. From Geneva. - What are you doing here in Rome? - I'm studying at the university. - Which faculty? - Philosophy. - Is this an interrogation? - No, I just want to get to know you. I would've chosen philosophy as well, if I'd continued studying. - Where are you heading? - The sea, for a good swim! - I love swimming. - Seems we share the same interests. What is it? - I shouldn't have listened to you. - Really? The sea is a lot better here. Good morning, lady. She's given birth! He looks so cute! - Come on, what are you doing there? - Coming. - Who's given birth? - You'll see! Franz! How is Esmeralda? Did it go well? Yes, he's a wonderful little colt. He hasn't stopped drinking! This is my friend, Thomas. My husband, Franz. Shall we go out? We don't need to stay here. Yes, I'd prefer that because I don't get on well with animals. Go ahead. I'll see you later. - What's wrong? Did it upset you? - Not far off... I swear I've never felt so uneasy. I don't understand you, why did you drag me here? And why didn't you tell me you're married? Look, there... Do you want to dive in? That's our sea, but if you prefer the real thing, it's not far from here. It sure is a nice place. Do you live here all year round? No, we only come in the summer. We live in Marseille. Franz is a ship owner. He rests here and dedicates himself to his hobbies. Like taking care of mares in labour... He was so proud anyone would think he was the father! You're so foolish! Franz has other interests. You know, he's extremely cultured. He's passionate about the occult sciences. - He's famous all over Europe! - So you're a happy wife? You middle class wives are all the same, you're all hypocrites. Just listening to you, you sound crazy about your husbands. You say they're adorable, they're a treasure. But in reality... Isn't that right? You're very quick to judge people. - Are you sure you're not mistaken? - You're right. - Good. I'll be right back. You get undressed, dive in... Do what you like. You're at home! Let's have a swim. Isn't that why you're here? Come on, Thomas! The water's great! You were right, you know! Isn't it great swimming naked? It really is something else! Are you thinking of staying in Italy? I don't know if I want to kiss you or hit you. Until I graduate, at least. Then I'll be faced with the inevitable problem... To go on living in a middle class world I find alien, which rejects me... Or go on ignoring it to live how I want, following my more genuine impulses... To finally find out who I really am, and what I want. - Stay as you are. - Sometimes I scare myself. If I think that I could die without having resolved the doubts I have inside me. Without knowing the divine moment of the evasion of the soul,... Of its fusion with the universe. Just think what it must be like to have a cosmic consciousness! I'd like to change mankind, society. But not how so many people say they want to today. I don't accept violence. It's something I honestly despise. Maybe it's necessary to defend fundamental aspects of humanity that are sacred to me. The world is in ferment. Everyone talks about peace, about human dignity... Yet all we do is encourage brutality and vulgarity, and hypocrisy. Something has to change. We can't go on like this. Perhaps I'm an idealist. Perhaps I'm a dreamer... But I'm certainly a nuisance! Am I boring you? Not at all. I was surprised when you chose me out of all those other guys this morning. I liked you straight away, you seemed so clean... So helpless. I said to myself; "He's a real man. " If I have a son, I want him to be like you. All that swimming has made me hungry, I'm going to prepare a snack. - Okay? - Why not. I'll call you as soon as it's ready! - Just don't go over 11,000 revs! - Okay. -Take it. "Will the drivers please make their way to the track" Thomas! It's ready! Hurry, or I'll eat everything! There's too much light, isn't there? Sit down. - Aren't you hungry? - You bet! I'm dying of hunger! I go crazy for sandwiches, what about you? Me too, If they're good. Have you ever made love to a married woman? - Would you? - Are you making fun of me? If you're only going to tease me, then tell me now. Then I'll say my goodbyes and go, without wasting time. You don't even know that the anticipation is the real magic moment of love! But first, I want to shatter your indifference. - You make me angry like that. - Really? Go, I don't want him to find you here! Aren't you beautiful! You behave! Then it isn't true that you don't like them. That you don't get on with animals. Not as much as you. I love everything that's real. Pets irritate me. It would be great if they were free and spontaneous. It's a form of protest that's been outdated for a couple of centuries. It all depends on one's concept of freedom. This is a discussion that could take us very far. But this isn't the time or place... - and I'd like to talk to you. - Talk to me? Yes. About Madeleine. She's affected by schizo-paranoid hallucinations... Dominated by the influence of a complex of a sexual nature. Her psychiatrist says I should indulge her every whim. Whatever it may be. Something unpleasant happened to her during her adolescence. Something that upset her psycho-erotic equilibrium... - Forcing her to distort reality. - Why are you telling me this? - Because you can help her. - Help her? - Sorry, I have to go, Mr... - Schuman, Franz Schuman. - It's late, I must be going. - Without saying goodbye to Madeleine? She would be upset. Here she is! You're in luck. This way you won't waste time. - Goodbye and thanks! - Come back again. Let's go. It's strange. It seems like... It's like I'm seeing you for the first time. But I know who you are. I'm sure of it. We do know each other. Say it. Yes, Madeleine. Don't you remember? Forget about it. It's something that happens often to me. Forgive me. - I don't even remember your name! - Thomas. Right, it's true. Thomas. Sometimes I'm overwhelmed by things that are too much for me. I'm at the mercy of an unknown force I'm afraid of, but I can't escape it. Sometimes it possesses me. It transforms me. It stirs up sensations that drive me to a painful spasm. I can't explain it. Then I return to my senses, like that. You must have experienced some sort of shock... A trauma, perhaps? Perhaps... but I can't tell my dreams from reality any more. Take the story of the reeds... Franz says it's just a nightmare, but I've seen them there in the trees. I've heard them. They... Who are you? What do you want from me? Everything! We want everything! - Your soul. - Your happiness. - We want your blood. - Your youth. No! You won't be Madeleine anymore. You will just be the personification of our desires. I haven't been myself since that day. They've taken control of me. Don't you realize it's absurd? It's just a fairy tale. A silly fairy tale someone told you when you were still a child. Naturally, it scared you. - Try to see sense. - Do you think I'm crazy? - Is that what you think? - No... I jthink you have an over-active imagination... and you're trying to run away from your boring life that you despise at heart. - Then who am I? - I just told you. You're a lost soul. It was a wonderful day. I haven't felt this happy for ages. Who knows if we'll have more of them? Would you be offended if I said not like this? Offended? Why should I be? Quite the opposite. If you say it, that means only one thing... That this meeting was also important to you... and important things, nice things, are unique, right? Yes, but it's hard to convince oneself. And people delude themselves thinking they'll find happiness for sale in a supermarket. - And where can I find you? - I don't know. Maybe near the Spanish Steps. With the hippies? Why not? Let's head back. - It's late! - What will your husband say? Franz? He isn't my husband, he's my lover! - Good morning, sir. - Good morning, Giovanni. - You're early. - I was impatient to be with you. - Antonio, take care of the luggage. - Right away. - The plants have certainly grown! - You haven't been home for a while. - You're Lewis, right? - Yes, I confess! - How did you know? - Guess. Look, there are photos of you everywhere! - So true! - It's not like you're a famous actor! - Anyway, welcome back! - Thanks for the welcome. I didn't know my father was so obsessed with me! Look at that photo, it's like a Picasso! All lopsided, eyes in place of the nose! - By the way, where is my father? - I'm afraid he's away for two days. He's in London on important business. So important it forced him to interrupt his holiday! Does he want to buy the entire British fleet, or does he want to sell his... so he can go and hide in Tibet? I can't wait to see him. I haven't seen him for a while. I live with my mother in the States. They're divorced... unfortunately. I'm chatting away and I haven't even asked you who you are? - I'm his secretary, Madeleine. - I approve of my father... - unconditionally! - What are you getting at? - Are you busy today? - Very... I'm at your complete disposal! - That's why I'm here. - Then I feel sorry for you... I'm frighteningly demanding. You'll see! - What are you drinking? - A Coke. Two Cokes. - Those Negro's dance really well. - Yes, they're great! - Did you see her legs? - Yes, I saw them! Listen, is there's any chance my father might delay his return? You should be ashamed! Is that how much you love him? - What if I tell him everything? - He'll be over the moon. He'll say my son takes after me. Or he'll say; Typical reaction from an only child spoiled by his divorced mother. - Do you think he'll be right? - You doubt him? You're wrong. Your father never makes mistakes. He always knows what's going on. Come on, let's dance. That's fine, thanks. - These days have flown by. - Too fast! It reminds me of... Of when I was a child... - When school was about to start. - Let's not talk about school! I always found it a nightmare. I liked studying... but I was allergic to rules. I liked going out with my mother... or travelling with Dad. Reading, too. Staying at home. Just like you, I imagine? To be honest, I didn't like staying at home either. Your parents got divorced, but mine... Mine argued all day long, and this ruined my childhood. Not only that, it also left me deeply traumatized. To think, you seem like serenity personified. I'm serene with you, but it's different with others. - Thanks! - For what? Feeling relaxed with you? - What's wrong? - Nothing. I'm scared of myself. And what you don't know, what I don't know. Perhaps you won't like it, and I want you to like me. It's all been so simple since we met, like all my problems have been resolved. But now I'm starting to have my doubts again. If I can just find one shred of happiness in this life. I think it will be easier if we try together. Goodnight, Lewis. Wait! Damn it, you're great! Like a pro! And you're useless! It's completely different without wheels! Let's see if you can beat me. Now you're provoking me! - Got you! - It's not fair, I stopped! Careful, I'll fall. Had enough of me already? Is that how it is? You won't succeed so easily. This area is deep. It doesn't look like it but it's deep. I've never been here before but I recognize it. Marshes are all the same. Madeleine. What's wrong? Don't you hear it? A strange sound. What's got into you? Sounds? Listen. - What? - I can hear it. - Tell me what you hear? - It's coming from the reeds. I'll have a look. Relax. - Madeleine! - Lewis! - What's going on? - I saw her! - Who? - Take me away! Calm down. - Who is he? - You're so overbearing! - I can't even receive phone calls? - You can't have fun making me jealous. - Who's Thomas? - Some guy. A bit of a hippy. - And he's my brother! - Couldn't you have told me? No. We've arrived, wait here. - Why did you call? - I hope I didn't upset you. No, I'm just sorry I wasn't there. I called you because I had a strange feeling you needed help. I can't even tell you how it happened, but it was an irresistible impulse. I think it was a form of telepathy. Look, I'm not in love with you... and I never was. I even have a girlfriend now. - I have a boyfriend now, too. - That's great! I hope he's right for you. You need someone to help you finally grow up. - I've found him! - Did you leave Franz? - Why? Should I? - Of course. It's too hard to choose. It's a lot easier and lower to accept compromises. I haven't come here to argue. I wanted to tell you we're having a party in Lewis' honour... Franz' son. I want you to be there. I need you. Bring your girlfriend of course, I'd like to meet her. - I told Lewis you're my brother. - Your brother? Why? I don't know. But it's too late now. See you tomorrow. I find the womens liberation movement a very interesting phenomenon. - Don't you agree? - Yes, of course. After all, the youth of today are right beside us. - Do you? - And you? They are all obsolete themes, aren't they? -Yes, old as the hills. Very obsolete. -I'd like to see them facing real problems... - Today alienation affects masses... - True, it's another problem. Have you heard the latest Bacharach album? Yes, it's good, very good. Divine! We saw him in concert last year. Excuse me, dear. - It's so boring! - Don't exaggerate. - I could die of boredom. - Not a bad idea! Dying at a party. I'd make all the papers! Everything okay? A woman of my cultural depth must be at the avant-garde... I keep telling my husband, but he doesn't understand me! You travel a lot and you've seen so many things... What do you think? Have we progressed? - Pardon? - Are we going forward, becoming stronger? - Actually... - Has it stopped? - What? - The womens liberation movement. I'm a sportsman, I don't know much about these things. It doesn't interest me, I'm sorry. You're a handsome guy. You're excused! As a beautiful woman would also be? More, much more! You see, this is why the womens liberation movement fights with all its strength! That's why we've decided to discard our bras... - The symbol of female slavery! - Excuse me. These men! What a house! I thought these places only existed in the movies! - I couldn't live here. - May I? To your thoughts. - It would mean being part of the system. - I surprised you! Manipulating this little girl with all your puritanical thoughts! - Come on, let's dance. - Keep an eye on your sister! - The prawns are formidable! - No, they made me ill recently. I can't, either. I'm always on a diet. - All alone? - As you can see. - Your Lewis has stolen my Mary. - May I? Sure! You've found yourself a fine woman. She's very nice. She's a ballerina, right? Look, she told me. - Do you want to dance? - If you want to. Excuse me. I must attend to the guests. My usual. ...and he says, "No, Marquise, it was a mirror!" Do you know the one about duck and the orange? There's a duck, in France... Have you heard the one about the Englishman on the hijacked airplane? "Nobody move, we're armed... " They contact the tower "We want twelve million dollars. " The passengers fight back... The plane loses altitude. Finally, it lands... The passengers are being interviewed... "Tell us something about the flight. " - "Horrendous!" - "Who? The hijackers?" "No", says the Englishman, "The tea, it was very poor quality. " Here you are. You can have your slave back. - I warn you she's a feisty one. - Incorruptible! Are you sure? - Coca-Cola. - Yes, sir. Nice. They're all nice here. - What's wrong? - I feel great... No, marvellous! - It doesn't look it. - I just want to laugh and have fun! She must have had too much to drink. It happens when someone isn't used to drinking alcohol. Do you want to lie down in my room? No, I want to dance all night. She's a consumer object. They're taking advantage of her because they're weak, try asking me to strip! She's drunk! Let Madeleine take care of her. You'll see her when she's better. No, I don't want to. I'm fine... I want to dance! I want to have fun! - What are you drinking? - It's strange... - I've never seen her like that. - Evil always comes from deep down. Don't worry, she'll get over it. It won't be easy. - You can go, I'll take care of her. - Very well. Let's go next door. Come. The guests are asking about you. And Mary? How's Mary? Better. She's sleeping now. - Take me to her. - Don't be such a fool. I told you she's resting. She'll wake up in a few hours... and she won't even remember what happened to her. - Bye, little brother. - Bye. - Am I disturbing? - Heavens no! How is Mary? Better. Don't do that, it's worse! - Sorry, but I told you I was polygamous. - No, we won't excuse you! - I see you haven't wasted any time. - And you? Leaving me alone all night. You abandoned me, great! What do you think I should do now? I think you should kiss me. You'll take Billy for a walk as soon as we get home! He's been alone all night, poor thing. He must be so bored. - It's almost two o'clock! - Exactly, he'll need to pee! Bastard! Listen, how long will it take to get home? - Two hours. - Are you crazy? - An hour at most. - Sure, if I had a car like yours! - What are you doing tomorrow? - Lunch at the embassy. I turned them down. I'm not missing the game tomorrow. - I don't like watching it on TV. - Sure, it's better at the stadium... - You don't need to tell me that. - Are you kidding? Boxing is better on the television. It depends on where you sit. Get a front row seat, then tell me. What is he waiting for? - I'm coming! Goodnight. - Goodnight. Thomas! We're done. Poor guy, he was so young. - The medical report? - It's ready, don't worry. - Thank you. - Goodbye. So the party had already finished... and only the servants could've seen him entering the pool. And what did you see? His body was floating when I arrived. - Perhaps he drank too much? - It's possible. If you've ruled out suicide... - Then there's no other explanation. - Right, at least for now. I'd still like to see you all in my office... - to iron out a few formalities. - We're at your complete disposal. Goodbye. I have something to say... - It's very personal. - Okay. Terrible things have been happening around me for some time. Things that trouble me deeply... and it's becoming too much. You mean you're leaving me. I don't even know what I want anymore. I liked you at the start... I felt protected. But now... Yes, you fascinate me. But you also scare me. Who are you? And what power do you have over me? I need to think seriously about myself. Yes, yes. I understand... You want to clarify the dark sides of your ego. But which one? Mine, of the woman in front of you now. I don't care about the other side of me! Right, according to you she belongs to the past, but you're also part of the past... Don't you know? Every moment that passes doesn't belong to the present any more... It's already part of the past. It's just a memory. Truth or illusion? Nightmare, perhaps? What's true and sensible about what you say? The moment you say it, it's not real anymore, but was it ever? I don't know. I can't keep up with you. - Don't confuse me! - Do what you want. - I've never put chains on your wrists. - No, never... But that's even worse. I really would rather be a slave. Once the chains are broken, it's all over. But it's different for us. There's an invisible rope that binds us. A rope you have to help me destroy! I need to be alone for a while. To reflect. To put my brain in order. All these nightmares that linger inside. The little shoes, I don't know, the reeds... And now even Thomas' death. All things that destroy me. Taking away my will to live. I'm upset about that poor kid's death as well. Life is a gift from God and it's a great sin to throw it away. You have all the time you need to reflect, Madeleine. I just want you to be happy. I know. Thank you, Franz. - What's wrong, Madeleine? - Nothing. I'm scared of myself. Of the woman you don't know. Who even I don't know. You might not like her. And I want you to like me! Sometimes I scare myself! If I think that I could die without having resolved the doubts I have inside me. Every moment that passes doesn't belong to the present anymore. It's already part of the past. It's a memory. Truth or illusion? A nightmare, perhaps? If I can just find one shred of happiness in this life. I think it will be easier if we try together. Lewis. I couldn't sleep. I was still thinking of Thomas. Why did he kill himself? I don't know. But let's not talk about it anymore. I want to be with you. It will be dawn soon. - Have you ever watched the sunrise? - No, never. It's quite a sight. It's like a ritual. A ritual that's repeated every day. In a temple as big as the world! But for me, today, I see the sunrise in your eyes. - Because you are my world. - I love you, Lewis. Hold me tight and never leave me! - No matter what happens. - I promise. - I told you so many lies. - It doesn't matter. It will be different now. I want to make love to you. I want to have a baby with you. Hold me close, hold me. Aren't we the early risers! Madeleine is my wife. Did you know? She's a slut. - You didn't even know that. - Lewis... Don't believe him. Yes, I made mistakes, I lied... but I loved you with all my heart. Sure, just like you loved everyone else you slept with. That's your other side... The one you were afraid of. It was all just an act. I've been such a fool. Now it's all clear... You're a nymphomaniac! You make me sick! Lewis, my love. Please don't believe him. The experiment has yielded very positive results this time, professor. Who knows what that poor girl's been through? A few more moments of hypnotic sleep... And your wife will forget about her nightmares, with an intense... ...and unconscious desire to get rid of ghosts oppressing her mind. And this natural belief should benefit her subconscious a lot. Do you think these recurring nightmares will come back? It would be great if I could say no... Unfortunately, in cases like these... We can never be certain of the complete, definitive, emotional recovery of the psyche. But these very modern therapies we use give comforting results. It all happened after the car accident... - She had one breakdown after another. - It was quite a shock for your wife. - She feared for your life. - And I for hers. She was pregnant. She had an abortion. What I don't understand is why her dreams are always of an erotic nature? There is logical explanation... The disability she suffered, following the accident. These things can deeply trouble a young woman in love with her husband. Perhaps the thought that she couldn't have children with you... Yes, but in Barcelona, soon after the accident... I had an operation, and I'm completely cured. Yes, we're aware of that, but your wife was already in a state of shock... And upset about losing the baby, who she loved more than herself... She broke down. It seems logical. In these psycho-hypnotic sessions... My colleagues from Geneva and I have carried out a deep inspection... ...into the patient's psyche, searching in the most remote areas... Uncovering all the anomalies that made her... - How do you feel? - Fine, now. As though a heavy weight has been lifted from me. Lighter! Take her home now, and let her rest. You'll be the best doctor for her. Yes, professor. Do you think she'll return to normal, professor Schuman? It depends on what you mean by normal? A peaceful, happy person, with no problems. In that case, Mary, we would be God. I had an idea, let's go to Madrid next weekend. Are you listening to me? What are you thinking about? About Franz. - Please take me to my husband. - But I am your husband! No. Don't lie, Lewis. It's not true. That's not the truth.
