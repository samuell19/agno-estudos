This is the story of 2 girls- Anju and Manju,... ..who were born in this palatial mansion but never enjoyed it. When Manju was 6 months old, her maid kidnapped her. It is rumoured that the maid was mentally unstable. - Master! Master! -The owners took this loss to heart... ... and called Tribhuvan from the village... ... to look after the property. As soon as Tribhuvan arrived... ... plots started floating around the mansion... ...cause he wanted his brother's immeasurable wealth for himself. When Anju was ten... ... her parents died in a car accident. But people say that accident had been caused to happen. But nothing was proved. After Tribhuvan's wife's death... ... his sister-in-law, Amba came to leave his son. Amba came but never went back. It's said that Tribhuvan and Amba had an affair. One day Tribhuvan tried to kill Anju too. But the cunning Amba stopped him. As the property would then have gone to the trust. Tribhuvan swallowed his anger... ... and poor Anju had to pay the price. No! I don't want it. CHAALBAAZ - Why are you late? - Today is her parents' death anniversary... ... so she was shedding tears. Today is my brother and his wife's death anniversary... ... and no-one told me! This is disloyalty that the brother who looked after me... ... I forgot his death anniversary! I' m not worthy of pardon. I should be punished for my crime. - Anju, what's my punishment? - What are you saying, Uncle? I... was crying because of my helplessness... Who made you helpless? Did you, Amba? How could I dare do that? I' m a guest in this house. Anju is the mistress of this house. Yes, her wish will come true now. Anju, what do you want? Tell me, my child. I' ll offer flowers worth Rs.5/- to the temple in their name. Only worth Rs.5? For my honourable brother and his wife? Absolutely not! Buy all the flowers from all the shops. 10-ay Anju, in memory of her parents, will distribute... ... clothes and sweets to poor children. - Really? - Yes, child. - But the money? Don't you dare talk of money. Here dear, keep this money. - Distribute it. - No. - Take it, my dear. You must be crazy to think I'd give you money. One only sheds tears for the dead. Come on, to the bank. Come on and no excuses at the bank. I' m fed up of your tears. Keep this. Go. - Miss Anju, here's your money. - Give it to me. Times are bad these days. Carrying money is quite dangerous. We' re in a hurry. We take leave. What's the hurry? - Have a cup of tea. - Today is my brother's death... ...anniversary. Anju has to dole out clothes & sweets to the poor. We have lots of work. So we must take leave. - You' re forgetting something. - No, I've taken the money. - Anju has forgotting to sign. - Oh! Take. Cap! Sign. - Who gave this money? - To buy flowers, Dadu gave it. Dayal, come here. Dayal take off my shoes. Your fingers have grown old serving this family, Dayal. I' m proud of this fact, master. Who does this much to earn one's livelihood? I' m slave to your command, master. Why did you give Anju money against my wishes? - Want money? - Don't beat Dadu. Want to celebrate their anniversary? - Only five rupees. - What? - He only gave me five rupees. How dare you speak back! It's very important for you to obey me Dayal. - Yes sir. Hold this! Hold. Hold it. Celebrate their anniversary go on! Have you gone mad? If she dies we' ll be on the road. - But... Can't you wait? Spoiling matters. Still standing here! Go do your work It's only a little blood! Sister, if something happens to you, what' ll I do? Yes Raju, I have to live. For you, I must. I have nobody else but you! All this should be clean by the time we return, understand? Or l' ll make you wash the floor with your tears. She's putting on weight! Cut out one meal from her diet. Everything should be clean, understand... Stop crying and smile for me. Please sister. Okay whom shall I imitate? Shall I mimic Papa? She's put on weight, Cut out one meal from her diet. Sis, I want to get married. Strange, you' re not at all interested in my personal life. Friend, sis doesn't want to hear, so l' ll tell you. If I get married, she' ll get some respite. I've seen a girl also. She studies in my class. She's unmarried so far. She helped me with my spellings once. But her nose is always running! She' ll bring lots of chocolates in her dowry. I would've refused but its a matter of all those chocolates. - Sis, talk to her folks. - Crazy guy, stop it! I haven't seen you dance for ages. No. You know what' ll happen if they catch me dancing. Your face glows with happiness when you dance. No. - We did hear some music here. - Even I heard it. - Yes, sir. - Who was dancing here? Dancing? God knows. Anju was cleaning this place. Raju must the playing somewhere and at my age, I can't dance. - Answer to the point, go. - Alright. I've called important people for my birthday. Keep an eye on Anju. You've said it and Amba has heard it. - You relax. - Aren't you forgetting something? - What? - Nothing. Oh! Many happy returns of the day. By the way, how old one you today? Have I ever asked you your age? Happy birthday. So how many winters have you seen go by? - l' m a little boy still. - Where's Anju? I don't see her. She must be busy. I keep telling her there's no need for her to work. But she loves to do everything herself. - And where's Suraj? - I don't understand him at all. All kids return home by 10 but his night begins only after 10. Have you planned for some dance or its just cake and out? Wait a minute and watch, Mr.Vishwanath. Friends, thank you for joining me in my joy. You've always abused me for my miserliness. But today your abuses will be drowned by applause. Clap! Anju, what' re you doing here alone. Come, join in, come. How dare she slap you before other's Tribhuvan! You must take charge or things will go out of hand. I won't spare her,my whip hasn't tasted her blood for some time. Dance! Let me see how much you' ll dance today. Today l' ll make you dance to your hearts content. No! Don't beat me. Get up! Beat me! Yopu will beat me? Dance! You love to dance! I' ll show you such a dance that you' ll forget your own dance. You've danced to music, now dance to the tune of my whip. If I let go of you, you' ll fall and become lame. And you won't be able to dance anymore! Shall I let go? - No. - No, okay I won't let you fall. Got hurt? Broke your leg? Now we' ll make dear Anju stand & check whether her leg is broken. It hasn't broken. Then now it' ll break! You' ll hit me! On my birthday! You will humiliate me in everyone's presence? Master! Stop it! Have mercy! Forgive Anju, sir! She' ll never dance. Explain to, her that if she ever dances again,... ... she wont have feet left! She won't dance again. Get up child. Get me poison, Dadu. I want to die, Dadu. Why doesn't death come to me? I cannot take this anymore. Have patience child and trust in God. Remember my child. Whoever gave that whip in Tribhuvan's hand, also gave... ... somebody else the power to snatch it from him. Manju is my name, what? - Sorry, Manju bai. - Me, bai, a courtesan. You called me a super stage artiste, a courtesan? I didn't, my boss did. Will you pay me or not. I danced and performed a whole show for you. Didn't you tell her what I said? What did he say? He said you should come for dinner to claim your money. Take care of this girl. Brother, you? I...I was simply joking! Doesn't matter, l' ll take my money later. Bye, Tata. Jaggu, things are beyond my control now. I won't get involved in your problems. Sir, you banged into my car. Please pay up for the damage. You want money, here take this. Jaggu, sir. I was just paying up. Take it. Rs 60/- for taxi damage. You keep the rest. He dented my cab. - What? - Dirty, dirty, chhee! You speak as if it's yours. Come on, put down the meter. - This cab is booked. - l' ll pay the full fare. - You' ll pay? - Look, don't act smart. There are plenty of cabs in town. Then go with somebody else. If I go elsewhere, what' ll happen to your meter? You've a big actress, come on, sit. Red Fairy! - Here take five rupees. - Five rupees? But the meter shows twelve rupees. - We used fuel worth five bucks. - Is the cab your pop's? - Don't reach my Dad. - Okay, okay. - Keep these five rupees for your dowry. - Okay. Marry a nice chap. These daily fights are not meant for you. Soon you' ll see me as an all lndia star! Have you ever seen yourself in a mirror? Get married before its late. Or you' ll be left beating the drums at a brothel. Or you' ll and up as some one's mistress.Now get lost l' m going. Stupid girl! Wears rented clothes and dreams of stardom! My name is Chinchinchu,the night is moonlight, you and me... My buffalo has become thin feeding you her milk. I've got blisters on my hands, washing your clothes.Pay me now. You ate my salt and now want to gulp down our money too. You found this day to come to claim your money. Why Manju? What happened? What is left to happen now? My mom! - What happened to her? - The same that happened to Dilip... ... Kumar in Devdas and Rajesh Khanna in Anand. - Super hit! - No, cancer. When my mom is no more, why should I live? I too will die! Your milk... - Not mine, my buffalo's. - Whatever, your clothes. Everything will be dust in the end. We came and will return empty handed. Be it a king or a beggar, a Manju or a Bihari. - Finally what's in your lives? - What? Nothing but a coffin and 2 feet of earth. There's nothing in this game, nothing. It's a two day game with income tax problems in between. When the heart is broken, why live? I am leaving. Where's my house? Where? Don't Manju! Are we dead? In bad times we' ll help you. No brother I've bothered you enough already. No more now. At the most people' ll say she could pay... ... neither milk nor clothes bill.. -... and what was your's? - Salt. And I couldn't even pay for my mom's treatment. Don't cry Manju. Take this from me. How can l? - I have only twenty. Take them. - Will do. I too am a father. Take this from my side. It's okay. How will I ever repay you? Slowly, slowly. Leave me alone with my sorrows, please. Let's go. The night is moonlight, you and me... We' re very sorry to inform you that your mother... ..who is admitted to the mental hospital is suffering from fits. Hence you are informed to come and meet her immediately. - How's my mother? - Come, l' ll take you to her. - Mom! - No, don't touch me. I' m a serpent. I' ll bite you,run away, you unfortunate! - Don't say that, mom. - Go, run away, go! I' ll bite you. Open, sesame. Brothers, you appear very troubled. If you don't mind, may I help you? The car's got locked. What' ll you help? Get lost. Incidently l' m a car expert. Nobody knows a car better than me. I can look at a car and tell what's wrong with it. There's another way to start a car. - How? - With the key. - How do you have the key? - When Dad gave me this car,... ... would he keep the key with himself? I hope while leaving home you all told your mothers... ... that you'd be late or might not return at all. You've returned, Suraj? But it's only 4 a.m.! The whole day is left. How did you return so early? It seems as if you haven't slept. The world rises with the sun and l' m only your father. I've told you often not to spoil your sleep for me. If his son comes home breaking panes,... ... then the father can't sleep. - Who told you that? - Somebody. - Who? - The police. They mustn't have told you that I caught a car-stealing gang. - Caught them? - Yes Dad. - Very good! But there are other things that a man has to do. Look Dad, I understand your point, you too see my point. I work with you in the factory throughout the day. Then I get a little time so I go to the disco. - And break window panes. - Yes, I do. - And I apprehend thieves. - All that is fine but... ... at least select one girl from the snaps I've shown you. All the photos are good but none of the girls is suitable. Then what girl do I bring for you? Beautiful, dad! When I return from work she should take care of me & say... One beer please. Forget about beer! I won't give you even a glass of water. I' ll pay up your bill next week. Why are you losing your sleep? And you too have one chilled beer on my account. I' m hearing this for the past one year. I won't die without paying your bill! - After all what's my age? - Thirty two. Take these 32 rupees and give me 2 bottles of beer. - Want some? - I drink with my own money. And money is what she never has! Give me one bottle for free. This time it's on me next time you pay for me. No, no. I don't want it but if you insist, l' ll have to accept. - But only 2 bottles? - How many will you drink? As much as you can buy me. - Doesn't anybody stop her? - l' m not married as yet! - I too am a bachelor! - Then shall we? Phokat, give us one beer please. - There no more beer! - Then get the bill. -l' ll clear everthing next week. -l' ll pay it. Where do you live? ..House? My house is very big-really big! It takes so long to go from one room to another that... I' m thinking of buying a cycle. - You didn't tell me your name. - Sunita, Salma or Suzie. How does it matter? I' m only a woman... ... wanting to live in this man's world on her own... ... terms. - Yes, terms. - And wants to drink others' beer. - Shut-up! It' s going to pour heavily. I must go home. Okay. - l' ll give you a lift. - I neither take nor give lifts! I' m going. Where's my house? It's this way. " Wonder where she has come from" " Wonder where she will go" "This girl will make me go crazy" " It is a short meeting" " But it's very sad" "This girl won't be wooed by anyone" " Your wet body will set my body on fire" " When the dark shadow of my tresses falls on you" " It will make you go crazy" " You will miss me all day and night" " But it's very sad" "This girl won't be wooed by anyone" "This wet girl, has she run away from home and come" "This is not a girl, she is a serpent" " Who has awakened from sleep and come" "Give your hand into mine" " But it's very sad" "This girl won't be wooed by anyone" "Sit comfortably besides me, you need not fear" " My state is not so bad for me to fall in love with you" " You will miss me all day and night" " But it's very sad" "This boy won't be wooed by you" Son, as far as I recall, you have 6-7 umbrellas... ... 10-1 2 rain coats and quite a few cars... ... that' ll the useful in this rainy season. - But if I wanted to get wet? - Accepted. But why are you ruining the family reputation... ... wearing a girl's hat. You've had enough tea, etc with girls in the beer bars. Now look at this snap of a good girl that I've brought. - This photo! - Yes. I've already promised her parents. Where did you find such a beautiful girl? - l' m your father. - You' re truly great. - Shall I fix things then? - Let's go rightaway. Not now, tomorrow. You want to see Anju? -But you've seen Anju? -I have but l' m not marrying her! Suraj is and he wants to see her. He's agreed to marry her? - Who? - Mr. Vishwanath is coming to see Anju. - So let him come. - But, but... - l' ll manage everthing. - How? She hasn't created a scene for long. Mr. Viswanath, I don't recall Anju's parents... ... having spoken of marriage... ... but if you say so, it must be. I thought you'd remember. - That's why I telephoned you. - Okay. Anju will soon be here. What will you have? We've come for a bride and we' ll only take her. There's dear Anju. Careful. Sit down, child, sit. - Good day, good day. - Live long dear child. This is my son, Suraj. Good day. Make some tea. Sugar,... how many spoons? None, none for me, child. - Won't you have beer? - What? Won't you show me the garden? Yes, yes, my daughter, take him Show him the garden. Yes, yes. If you want to go to the garden, go ahead. Sometimes she gets these kind of fits. - Fits? - Nothing much. Take her up. Don't be scared. She' ll be fine. For a while, I thought the injection was adulterated. God's justice can be delayed not denied. At least we've got relieved of this problem. What happened to your nephew? I've called him; must be on his way. - What's his name? - Batuknath. - What nath? Batuknath Lallan Prasad Malpani is my name. I' m looking for this address for 2 1/2 hours and can't find it. Brother?

I' m Tribhuvan speaking. - Listen. - I am listening. I know that. you' re speaking and l' m listening. - What happened to you? - Nothing. Who is it? - Amba! - Amba isn't home, go away. - Then where has Amba gone? - Me! I' m Amba! Ghost! no. You' re not a ghost, Mr.Viswanath. Go wash your face. You speak of washing my face? I bathe daily unlike you! I know you've had a bath, I have not washed my face since morning. - Go, go go. - Tribhuvan, why are you tongue-tied? He's gone mad! - What happened? - l' m in this house because of you... ... and you disappeared. See, l' m hurt. I could need anything and you don't care one little bit! What do you want? ....What do you want? - l.. I' m thirsty. - Leave me! I' ll get water, leave me. Leave me. He left me. " My heart pines for you" " It's difficult to live without you" " What do I do?" " lmmortalise your love" "Take my name and die" "That's the only cure for you, O my crazy lover" " From morn to night" " My heart chants only your name" " What's so special about me that's made you so crazy" " You are so beautiful, I need you" " What do I do..." " Your body is fire, it has singed me" " Your talks make me swoon" " Do I take that as your refusal, or your consent" " What do I do..." We've come at the right time. Jaggu has come. You've come back brother? Where were you all night? - In jail. - Were you getting thrashed? - Where's Manju? - Don't take her name. I was in jail because of her. - l' m fuming at her name. - What has she done? What an actress! Says, she doesn't know me! Has never seen me! And then sat in my boot. I am fed up of her! I swear some day, l' ll chop her to pieces! - And do you know what she says? - What? What's that liquor... no... wine. She says I don't drink wine, sir. What's so funny? She's done one show and thinks she's a great star! - l' m fed up of her! - So now where's she? How the hell do I know where she is? The police is also strange! Locked me in and released her! - So, she didn't come with you? - Yes, thank god... You! Get out! - Look Manju. - My name is Anju. - She's changed her name overnight. - Oh! - What else have you changed, mom? - l' m not your mother? If you are following me to beg forgiveness,forget it & get out! - Where do I go? - That is your house. Go and die there! - That's my house? - Mother, that's your house... ... and that's mine, that's a tyre and this is Jaggu... This is the earth and that, the sky. That's east and this west. - This is north and that south. - I know that - What? North, south, east and west. Will you go or should l make over your face? Go! - Mr.Jaggu! - You, here, at this hour? What do you want? Can I sleep here? Why? Are the bed bugs playing in your house? No,no. But l' m feeling very scared, all alone. You are scared? The world is scared of you! I won't bother you. I' ll sleep here quietly. Okay, how does it bother me? Go, lie down! Thanks very much! Where were you the whole day? Do you know what happened in your absence. - What troubles have... - Not so far but if you sit tight.. ... then there will be the devil to pay! Since she's come, she's made life miserable! I' ll hit her so hard that she' ll forget everything. Bring my hunter. You ingratiate! Now I know you instigate Anju against us! You, old man, you! Wear it Tribhuvan, wear this bangle. The hands that think its masculinity... ... to beat an old, helpless man... -...will look good with this bangle. - Who are you? My name Maybe anything; Sita, Sakina or Suzie.. ... Kamla, Vimla or Anju. How does a name matter? I' m just a woman who in this world made by men... ... is standing alone... ... against the cruelty, torture and bestiality of men. Till today I had bangles in my hand while you had the whip. But today I've thrown those bangles away. Now they' ll be in your hands... ... and this whip in my hands. How dare you! Have you gone mad? You hit with these very hands huh? Scream louder! Get up! Scream! Let the walls of this house hear your screams. Let the whole country hear you! Let every man and woman hear. When a whip comes into the hands of a woman then... ... the world becomes insufficient... ... for people like you to escape! Wear the bangle! Wear it! Run! As long as l' m here, if I see this whip,... ... I' ll whip your skin off! Grandpa, l' m very hungry. Get me something to eat. Yes, child, l' ll bring it. Don't come here. The liquor has gone. - Where are you going so late? -I was getting house in the fear ... Chhee! I was getting scared in the house. I was looking for you only. - You also get scared Manju? - l' m not Manju! - If not Manju, then who' re you? - l' m Anju. There she starts again! - Jaggu, what's happening? - She must've had cheap liquor! She drinks daily but never does this! Yes, I too am seeing this for the first time! May be, a ghost... It's possible, quite possible! - Now what do we do? - There's only one cure. - Johny - Who's he, a dancer? - No, an exorcist. - He' ll exorcise her ghost - Yes. - Swear by me - Yes. Then lets call him. "O Ghost, leave her" "Just wait" " I will control you" " Run away" "Someone explain to me, I am confused" " l' m in trouble" " Amidst of ghosts a lone girl like me" " I left the house..." "... I lost the way" " From the frying pan into the fire" " Now you will have my thrashing" "This is true, I am not a ghost" " l' m a beautiful maiden" " l' m in trouble" " Amidst of ghosts a lone girl like me" "The ghost deserves to be thrashed" " You all seem like ghosts to me" "The messengers of death" " What did you say" " It's night during the day, an unusual thing happened" " What has fate done" " l' m in trouble" " Amidst of ghosts a lone girl like me" "O Ghost, leave her" " Please forgive me, Do justice to me" " I agree to whatever you say" " I recognize everybody" " Fate defeated me, I give up" "The ghost has left" " Now stop this music" Shut up! My body is aching. Press it a little. Such a long Balma! This manner of yours drives me insane! - What else do I say? - Not say but do. With these delicate hands of yours.. ... attend to me. - Attend? - Don't you understand massage me with oil. Once I'd told you and you'd massaged me and that dog... ... massage - I remember. But what hand do you prefer soft or hard? I' m a man - no soft touch for me. I want a hard massage. - You want a hard hand. - Yes. She's trapped! Why are you closing the door? - To massage you! - Massage! You want a massage? Then shut your eyes! This is the hard hand and this the soft one! - And now for the really hard ones. - Help, help! Help! - Batuk! - Balma - Whose? - Yours - Not mine! - Who are you? - l' m a small little, cute baby. - Oh! He's our Balma? - See what Anju has done to him. Send him back to the village. He's had it. I' m going. Mr.Jaggu! Chhee! How filthy! Everyone keeps flowers; he; a broom! Kerosene! It seems to be some dirty, stale water. Today is Sunday. So? It's the day to drink liquor. Miss.Manju, what's in this? There was some horribly stinking thing in it so I threw it. Oh! Horribly stinting? Where did you throw it dear? - In the drain. - In the drain? My fifteen rupees worth of liquor down the drain! - Then what's in this? - K...ke...kerosene. - Did I do right? - Get out or l' ll hit you hard! Forgive me please. Hit me if you wish. Forgive me. If I knew you'd get angry, I wouldn't have done it! - What's in this? - Food. - Where did you get it from? - From out! No,l mean I made it. I thought you'd be hungry, is it tasty? Yes but next time ask me before you do anything. Okay can I keep this plate down? No keep holding it in your hand. - May I leave? - Yes. - Can I take this? - Yes. Mr.Mathur? Good day, Miss.Anju. Miss.Anju, you' re looking different today. And Mr.Tribhuvan, you too look quite different today! - I hope you've feeling fine. - The weather is affecting him. How strange! People are affected differently... ... by this change of weather. Betel leaf. Will you have? Here. Here are your papers. Sign then. - Where do I sign? - What happened to your hand? The tanpura fell on it. The whole instrument. Only this got saved- the thumb, will it do? Will do. Why not? I know you since childhood. - Here's your money. - l' ll keep it. - These are mine? - Of course. I' ll leave now. Uncle isn't feeling too good. Anju, give this money to Amba. She' ll keep it in the locker. Yes dear, times are bad thieves abound all over. - That I can see. - Give it here. I' ll keep it safe. I too can keep it. Where's the key, Miss.Amba? - With Tribhuvan. - What? The key is always with you! -I gave it to you in the morning - But I retuned it by evening. My palm is itching. If don't get the key soon, this will start off. Listen to me, give her the key. Then what' ll happen to you? If you don't give the key, then what will happen to you? - Did you think of that? - This is no time to think Amba! In any case, what is in one key? - Everything! - Give up worldly attachments and give her the key - Should l? - Yes! - It's in your pocket. Here's the bunch of keys, Anju. Thank you, Tribhuvandas, loafer. Good that you came on time, grandpa. Now on, you' ll keep these keys. - Keep these in the vault. - But... Everything is beyond control. If we don't do anything, we' re finished. I can't think unless you keep shut. - Okay, think. - Got it! - What? Food in the picnic and double dose in the food. Double dose, my foot! I' ll add something to your food that... ... you' ll be floating on clouds. " What had I planned, and look what has happened" " Look for me, I am lost somewhere" " Even I am lost somewhere" " We are doomed" " Doomed!"

Eloping is not the answer. Try to understand, Anju. Okay l' ll talk to dad once more,... ... if he doesn't agree we' ll run away. Son, with whom are you talking about running away? With Anju, Daddy. Son Suraj, you are my only child. And I want you to be happy. I had absolutely no idea that... ... you love Anju, with such fervour. If you wish, l' ll fix your wedding with Anju. - Really Daddy? Then l' ll go and tell Anju immediately. No, no, you sit. I' ll call up and inform her. - What happened to the phone? - It's been out of order. - Then whom were you talking to? - I was rehearsing. But don't go back on your word, Daddy! Just like his father! Where are you taking me? I' m taking you to meet an important man; my boss! Forgive me boss, in this cab business and heavy traffic... ... I had no time to come to see you. You know the world's problems. So you know my problems too. Wish. Not me, the boss. You are my mother, father, boss, friend, everything... ... so l' m telling you. I've decided that next week... ... I' ll marry Manju. - I've got the cards printed. - What are you saying? Do you have any objections? - But.. - Do I have any bad habits? - Do you love somebody else? - Chhee, Chhhee! All over the world, girls are growing old. You won't find a boy like me in the whole world. Later you' ll repent. If there's a problem, and you want to refuse,... ... say so before boss. Don't create problems later. But I never refused! Come! How are you? Fine, I hope. You' re enjoying all this;... ... this house, it's luxuries, the servants... - Who won't enjoy it? - Yes, who won't? Specially when it's not your own but somebody else's. - What do you mean? - Meaning this is Anju's house. This wealth, these luxuries, servants, everything is Anju's And even Suraj! No, not Suraj! Suraj! Suraj is mine! He loves you thinking you are Anju... ... that too is Anju's debt to you. - What are you saying? - These are Anju's leftovers that... ... you are getting due to good fortune. - No, no, no... - What no, no, no At least don't fool yourself. You are fooling the others! I didn't stay here by my own will. They need me here. No, they needed you but no more. One doesn't wear a mask forever. After the show, the mask is taken off. Now your show too is over. Your welfare lies in revealing your true self now. Or don't you feel like returning to the poverty of the slum? Bit me! Look Manju, if you don't tell Suraj the truth... ... then the result of the deceit will be terrible. Look Manju, if you don't tell Suraj the truth... ... then the result of the deceit will be terrible. I was coming towards your place. - I too was coming to you. - It was imperative to meet you. For me too! Suraj, I don't want to keep you in the dark anymore. Why you! Nobody can keep Suraj in the dark! I want to tell you everything truthfully, today. Don't take the trouble. I know the truth. - What do you know? - I didn't expect this from you. Suraj! I was helpless! At the hands of love? That love seems very strong. But I don't want to lengthen this drama anymore. - l' m very tired! - That happens when you board 2 boats. You are right. Leading 2 lives, I've forgotten my real life! You have probably forgotten whom you are deceiving. - Me, him or yourself? - What are you saying? - Maybe you are amongst those girls... ...for whom one man is not quite enough! What? You! You! - You' re crossing limits! - What limits have you left? Such a dirty thing about me! How could you even think? If you can do dirty things, can't I think of them? What have I done? What? What you've done? What have you done is unpardonable! It's my decency that l' m talking not killing you! Look mister, I don't know what you saw or didn't. But after seeing this face of yours,... ... I don't want to talk to you. - Now the truth is out! - Yes, it is! Give me some liquor! - What did you say? - Liquor! Give, quick! - You' ll drink liquor? - No, l' ll eat it! Don't be miserly. Give me a drink quickly. Damn it! Tell me honestly. What happened to your brain? Don't spoil my brain! Give me a half, quarter bottle, whatever... But you said drinking is not good! If you want to give me liquor, give, don't yap needlessly! I' m not asking for free. I' ll pay you, later. Why don't I understand these women? Sometimes they are so sweet, at others so evil! I' ll drink lots today. I' ll die drinking. Without drinking you create a nuisance... ... if you drink and you' ll die! There's nothing to live for in any case! You tell me, will you give me liquor or not? - You won't drink. - I will. - No. - Yes. He refuses! What cheek! - Got some rope? - Yes, shall I bring it? - Here. - Thanks. - What are you doing? - Suicide! You don't let me drink or die! Then what do I do? I don't want to be a widower before marriage. - What do you want? - Liquor! Just now! You had given up then how come? - How does it matter to you? - Something is wrong. No, it doesn't who' ll drink this? I' ll drink, my wife and kids will drink, what's it to you? - Take this money. - I was just asking. -....What? Making inquiries! Scoundrel. It's so late. He hasn't returned as yet! He must be having a drink himself. - Jaggu what's this? - Not for me, for my fiancee. Disgusting! Holy cow! Now she's praying! Changed her dress too! Take, drink now. Why, is it a custom to drink wine before marriage? From liquor, she's come to wine Drink quickly now. - You had given up drinking! - So had you! - Me? I don't touch wine. You know that. - They' ll break! - Let them! What happened to you all of a sudden? - l' m going insane with happiness. - Then its okay. What is? Now do you want this or not? No. Gandhiji said that in life... - Quiet! You' ll drive me mad! I' ll marry you now before you change again. Where are you going? Gandhiji said return the bottles! - Give me one 420. - Sir I've heard of 120 and 300. ... but what is 420? - Add the two. Result? - 420 - Give me the same. Hey, make one for him. Good grief! The best of guys get floored on seeing her! -She's the pride of our colony. -The pride of your colony? - Anju? - Not Anju, but Manju. You may hit me but she's Manju of our colony. - Aunt when did you come out? - l' m getting better now! - Have you seen Manju? - ldiot, listen Manju is her daughter. She's worshiping Jaggu's taxi, Aunt. Why is she worshiping Jaggu's taxi? Don't you know? They' re going to get married. Yes Aunt, really, have a sweet for this good news. This glass looks so small... ... but must have gulped a lot of bottles. And with every bottle, many sorrows, many unfaithful... Unfaithfulness? One can measure a bottle by the depth of the glass... ... but the depth of a woman's heart can't be measured! No one knows how much of deceit and deception is there! Whatever enters a woman's heart is only to wound her. One who doesn't have a heart can't feel any wounds. - l' m Balma speaking. - Who? I' m a small, little, cuddly.. I've solved the case now I know how that kitten became a lioness. - What? - Actually there are not one but two litters. What nonsense? Kittens! Anju is standing here, in a slum before my eyes. - But Anju is here! - She's Manju her twin sister. If you don't believe me,... ... I' ll bring Anju to the house right now. And l' ll bring her mother too. Don't do that! Bring has to the Alibag house. Alibag house? Okay l' ll bring her right away. The Alibag house?! Your to-be husband is in front of you and you worship a cab? Not Jaggu! Say Balma. - Say Balma! - Balma. - Say my Balma. - My Balma. - Yes! - Daughter! - There, the mother too has come. - You too come along. Come - Jaggu. Brother, Gandhiji said to return the bottles. Hey John, thank you very much. I' m getting married. - You must come. Don't forget. - But who's the girl? It must be a special girl who put down my meter. Friend, but tell us who it is. She's a true lndian woman. Like Savitri, Sakubai, Anusuya, Meerabai. She's always praying, all the time. Changed clothes again! What are you doing? Can't you see, l' m drinking? I can't understand when you pray & when you drink! - l' m feeling dizzy - Stupid ass! I asked for a bottle and you vanished. Bottle, again? Forgot what Gandhiji said? Look if you want to drink, get your own bottle.Don't bother me! Next week we' re getting married so don't talk like this! Marriage? - Whose marriage? - Mine How funny! You' re getting married? To whom? You, who else! - Me? - Yes. - Drunk without drink? Look, I've tolerated enough if I get angry... then? Go, go whom are you threatening? Why should I marry you? Don't make me angry or l' ll give you one slap on your face! You son of a taxi lay a finger on me and see! - You want to see? - Yes, I want to! - Want to see more? - Yes! I have no one who' ll save me. Beat me more. Now if you raise your hand, l' ll rip it out. I also know one shouldn't hit women but when the taxi.. ..doesn't start it has to be pushed. We marry next week. ... and now she's pretending. - Again? - When did I agree to marry you? - l' ll show you! See! See! You won't marry me? Am I mad? Bitch! In front of God you accepted and now you deny! She can never belong to one man. - What do you mean? - You pretend to love me and... Pretend to marry him. - What? Pretending to love you? - All false! - Then what's true, this? No, Manju has always loved you and will only love you! - Who is Manju? - She, who else? what name did she give you? Savitri, Anusuya, Sita. But she is Anju! Jaggu, that Balma, Auntie, kidnap, Manju. What nonsense is that? Speak clearly. Some Balma has kidnapped Auntie and Manju. - But l' m right here. - But you are Anju! - I am Manju! - One minute, one minute! He was saying two kittens, twins Anju-Manju... - Twins? - Twin sister? Take care of this menace. She's the root of our problems. Finish her off! Once she's no more, we' ll have no problems! Uncle, let me go. I've done nothing! You haven't so far, but now you will. Today is your 21 st birthday... ... and according to your father's will,... ... you inherit everything today. - What's written in it? - That of your own sweet will,... ... without any compulsions,... ... you' re willing the property over to me. - You are, aren't you? - No child, no! - Don't sign or they' ll kill you! - Quiet, old woman! - Sign it, dear Anju! - l' ll sign. - Sign! - Where? - Here. Stop Jaggu! He's got a revolver in his hand. - Then what do we do? - We' ll think of some plan. Come. Do you know what's written in this? That l' m committing suicide! Wait Mr. Tribhuvandas, wait! This signature is false, so is the girl! She's not Anju but Manju, this taxi driver's Manju. - Taxi driver's Manju? - Yes, according to his plan... Manju came and started living in your house. And he kidnapped my poor Anju. - What nonsense are you talking? - You' ll know soon. Talk! - No. - Will you talk or not? You' re strange! Put me in this situation and watch the fun coolly! Tell them what's our relationship. - Your relation with Anju? - Not her, but her, my Laila... ... Amba. - What? Are you bonkers? Yes, that's why, in greed, I listened to you. Here, stay here yes, tell me what did she say? I' ll tell you all. She saw me once with Manju and came to me... ... and said send Manju to my house... ... and they'd have murdered you. And we' ll he 50-50 partners in the inheritance. - Shall I go? - He's lying! - I never saw him before! - Shameless! I' ll sort her out later. First lets check out Anju-Manju. - Tell us, who is she? - She, she... She's my daughter, Manju. I' m Anju! If she's Manju! Where's Anju? I know where she is! She's waiting for him, in the garden outside. I'll get her in a jiffy. I' m Anju! No, no, no... I' ll do as you say from now on. She's genuine! Then come up with me quickly. How can I walk? First untie my legs. They tied me up and went away Balma! - I made a mistake in judging you. - What do you mean? Meaning I didn't find any good person in my life. So I couldn't recognise a good man with you. What a sad thing! Both sisters came together into this world... ...and will also leave together. And with them will be martyred this taxi driver! What are you saying? Doesn't matter! I have another one. You belong to me and I to you. Deception! Deceit! Today l' ll beat you so much that you' ll never tease anyone again. - Uncle! - He's running away! The girl got changed! They've cheated us! - Cheating Tribhuvan! - I told you, he's a liar! They' ll all die, at my hands but dear Anju... ... you have to drink poison according to the suicide note. Amba, push it down her throat! Jaggu! No, leave me! I don't want to die! Look after them! Amba let us go. Jaggu poison... Sister! - l' m very frightened! - Don't be! With me here no harm will befall you. - But they troubled me a lot! - What? They used to whip me and injections... -... and today...poison - Poison? - They forced me to drink poison! - What! - I don't want to die! Save me. - Yes, sister. I've found you after ages, I won't lose you easily. Come. Come. I' ll take you to the hospital! You' ll go to the hospital if I allow you! Sister! Your sister is almost finished. Soon you too will be! Leave me! Sister! Sister! Leave me! Jaggu, you take Anju to the hospital l' ll manage things here Manju, you check on Uncle-Aunt, l' ll remain here. - Send me to my village. - Why? Because l' m a small, little, cute, sweet baby. I won't let you go. I won't! How dare you! You brought her just in time. Soon she' ll be fine! Tribhuvan was saved but the law didn't spare him. Jaggu took his boss's blessings and married Anju. And there Manju and Suraj too set up a house. And after exactly one year, their children were born. And that too, twins. " He called my name" " I held on to my heart" " He teased me I turned away" " What else could I do" " He was standing in the street" " He was after me since very long" " He seemed very obsessed" Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
