- Hey, Darnell, it's like you're keeping warm? - Ain't nothing to the cold, Jack, it's all in the head. - Oh, yeah! So, is that a new move you got going? - It's the one you taught me. I'll be rippin' on it. See? Making it my own. - You're a future all star, uh? - Believe it! - It's about money, Doctor... Yes, well, I can't take it anymore... No, I can't explain, call it a woman's intuition. But I'm really getting worried. No, I'm not making it up. He's up to something. I can feel it. My session's over? All right... I'll call you next week. Thank you, Dr. Eberson. [ Doorbell ] Just a sec, Andy. - Hey, Mrs. Sullivan! Upstairs with Mr. Sullivan's stuff like usual? - Let me just check and see if anything of mind got mixed in by mistake again, yes. What's this? - Oh, I don't know, they musta found something in one of your husbands pockets. Wow! Looks expensive. Good thing they found it. Anyway, it's all right if I take this stuff upstairs? - Thanks, Andy. - Okay. - What are you doing here? - I live here. Remember? Where are you going? - Away! - Away? Away as in "away away?" Listen Charlene, let's sit down here, we'll discuss this. - Where Jack? Uh? Can't even sit on the toilet in this dump. Come on, you know this hasn't been working... It hasn't been working for sometime. No hard feelings? - Phone me later tonight, maybe we'll have some hard feelings by then. - Ah, Ah, Ah! Well... good-bye. - It's because I can't dance, right? - Always with the jokes, Jack. It's because you're not really here. Not even halfway here. Sometimes it's like I'm with the most wonderful man in the world. But most of the time, I feel like I'm living with the Invisible Man. - So I've been told before. Hey, Charlene! - What? - Take care of yourself! - I want to go short on Euros; a buy of 3 million, short term on a 2 months put... Just place the order... Trust me. Goodbye Jared. [ Beep! Beep! ] - Please, let me in! Open the door... open the door! It doesn't work! - Charles! CHARLES! Charles... Charles! Charles! - Detective Sergeant Al Sandestin! - What...? - I'm a police officer. - Well, do something. What's happened? - He's been shot. - Charles... Come on! - We need an ambulance. - You're telling me my husband was somehow involved in smuggling guns? - Not just ordinary guns, Mrs. Sullivan, heavy ordinance. We've had him under surveillance for sometime, now. - Charles was in real estate! There must be some mistake! My husband was a very respectable citizen.. - Obviously, all of this is a shock to you. Is there anyone you can call? - Yes, My sister Sarah. - You all done here, Carl? Right, I'll see you back at the station. - That's it. We'll follow up tomorrow. - Look, I don't understand what's going on here... [ Cellular phone ] - Ya... Okay. I'll be there. I... must leave you my card and... I must have left them in the car. I'll just go get one. - No... wait, I'll write it down. - It's Detective Sergeant Sandestin. S-a-n-d-e... - Oh... would you do it, please? - Of course. This is my number at the office. We'll talk tomorrow... I am sorry for your lost, Mrs. Sullivan. - [Radio]: The mercury dipped to a bone-chilling - 15 degrees yesterday... - Morning. Coffee? Thanks, Sarah. - Kath, we should probably call and find out where they've taken Charles' body. We'll have to make arrangements for the funeral. - I hadn't even thought about a funeral. Would you'll do it for me Sarah? I can't even intend... - Whatever you say. Do you want me to call the police? - No, I'll do that myself... - Okay. - Thanks. - What did they say? - They said... there is no Detective Sergeant Al Sandestin in the Police Department. - What...? - This is crazy, Sarah. They said there were no cops here yesterday, that nothing happened. If the police don't know what's going on... - I'll go call the Coroner's Office. There must be a simple explanation. You're sure no bodies were delivered there yesterday? Thank you. - Sarah, I'm not lying to you, I know what I saw. I saw it with my own eyes. - All right. I'll go down to the Coroner's Office and the Police Station right now. Don't worry, we'll get to the bottom of this. - Okay... thanks. - Elliot, as my lawyer, I'm asking you to help me... A private investigator? You know him f..from law school. Okay, okay, what's his name? - Ah! Hi. Jack Mize. - Hi. Sarah Harper... No, Katherine is in the living room. - Oh, okay. I guess one can never have too much security these days. Uh? - Yeah... - Hello. Well, you're called...? - Katherine Sullivan... How do you do, Mr. Mize? - Pleasure. - Where do we start? - Uh, well, uh... Why don't you tell me what happened? From the beginning... - Charles came in through the foyer. Over here, and he was being chased by Detective Sergeant Sandestin. - And what did this... Sandestin look like... Do you remember? - Yes, late 30's, early 40's, sandy blond hair, blue eyes, and he reaped of cheap after shave. - That's good. Do you recall what the others police officers looked like? - No, I didn't notice. - Did you notice a license on any of their cars, or...? - No... I was sitting over there most of the time. - And this Sandestin, did he give you a card? - No, but I have his number, he let it down over here... - Is he left handed? - Yes, actually I think he was. How did you know? - Well, left-handed people always write with a backward sland, its very prominent in lefties. So, um, this Sandestin came racing into the foyer from...? - outside. - Out... here! Both cars pulled up out here? - Yes. - Could you come and show me exactly where they stopped, because I want to see everything the way you saw it. - Can you please close that door? - Are you all right? - Please just close the door. - It's pretty cold out there today. - No, it's not the cold. I just don't go outside. - You don't go outside? - I haven't left this house for sometime. - Do you mind if I ask you how long that "sometime" is? - Three years. - She's agoraphobic? That's like when you don't leave your home, right? Yeah, it's from the Greek "agora" which means marketplace. These people have a paranoia about going outside, on the marketplace. So they just stay home. - Yeah? How do you know that? - I read it. In a book. You gotta try it sometime. - Oh, oh... I read the important stuff. - Hockey! The best and worst. - Yeah, a single father working a job like this doesn't have time to sit around reading artsy-fartsy books like some people I know. This chick got any money? - Tons. - Whacked-out rich broad doesn't leave her home. What's with that? - Maybe she's smarter than the rest of us. - Yeah? What's that supposed to mean? - Why, it's kind of rough out here, Bob. Haven't ya noticed? - Hey, Skippy. Been helping anyone skip lately, counsellor? - Oh... I get it. This is where the brain-dead cop tries to antagonize me into a fight. Now, what are my options here? Stand and take it, or pop you in the mouth? - No, no, no, no... - I'll opt for neither. - I guess you only say nice things to sexual perverts, huh, Mize? - All right, it's over, it's over. Let's say we just nix the testosterone challenge, guys? - Sit down. I was wondering if maybe you'd... find the license on this Mercedes for me. - I thought you dropped by just to say hi. - I did but... - Just like you were going to give me the name and number of that babe you were talking to in the bar the other night. - I'm still looking for it. - Gimme the license plate number. No, no, give me the paper. Don't call us, we'll call you. And I mean that, Jack! Unless you come up with that girl's name and number.... - Is it me or is it freezing in this house? Great, the furnace is broken. - I'll deal with it. - Like the Coroner's Office and the Police station. - It isn't my fault that the Coroner or the cops have never heard of you. There's no reason to get so upset. - Upset?! My husband's dead, they can't find his body, nobody knows anything and we're freezing. You're right, there's no reason to get upset. [ The doorbell rings ] - Don't worry I'll go call the heating people. - Did you find anything? - You were right. There was nothing at the morgue. I put a trace out on the Mercedes. - That's it? - Oh, yeah, for now. You know, I've got to find out more about your husband, who his enemies were, who may want to see him dead, and then hopefully something'll pop out that'll explain why all of this happened. - "Hopefully, something will pop out?" Is that usually how you conduct your investigations? - Mrs. Sullivan, I mean, you must be able to tell me something about your husband. I mean, what exactly did he do? - He was in real estate. - Oh, what else did he do? I mean, did he have any Interests, hobbies, sports? - Do other women constitute a sport? - D'you have any names? - No, I didn't get their names. - I understand... I understand What about his friends? - He didn't bring them home. And I certainly didn't go out to meet them. - How long were you married? - Eleven years. - Eleven years, it's a long time. I mean there's certainly must be something you can tell me about his world. - I've told you what I know. For many of the 11 years, we led virtually separate lives. - You may want to concentrate on those years that you weren't "separate." Cause I need some help, here. Did he keep any files in the house? - I don't think so, but you're welcome to go and check in his room... It's upstairs on the left. Any files? - No... no luck. Just his business card. When was this taken? - It's from Charles days at Yale. The Lacrosse team. He was terribly proud of that. Turn your son into a member of the Ruling Class in 4 easy years. - Where'd you go to school, Mr. Mize? - Little place in Jersey... So, tell me, how was your husband's business doing? - I'm not sure. As I told you, Charles and I... - "Led separate lives", yeah. I'll be in touch. - Who won? - The pool. Where'd you get that? - Your sister gave it to me. Said she found it in the kitchen. Why? - I wasn't in the kitchen. Would you like to go for a swim? I think I could find a spare suit. - Nah, I don't swim. I always considered it as something you do to avoid drowning. - You have a narrow view of the world, Mr. Mize. - Sometimes, yeah. - Shall we sit or is that something you do to keep from standing? - Touché. - I was just about to have a martini. Would you like to join me? - Sure. - Did you find anything today? - Nothing. - I trust you get better at this as time goes on. - I went to your husband's office, and I discovered nothing. As in no files, no business papers, no nothing. - Unfortunately, my husband was very lazy, Mr. Mize. - I'd appreciate it if you called me Jack. - Okay, Jack. - Good! - Olive? Now what can you tell me about your husband's business? - I already told you. I don't know anything. - You've got to be able to do better than that, this is going to be a little like trying to find Elvis. I mean, you surely must remember something! - I knew he wasn't doing well. If he done better, I guess he would've left me. - He wasn't doing well! Isn't this house his? - No, it's mine. I work very hard to keep it going. - You work? Doing what? - I'm a bond trader. In the age of the computer, you can work anywhere. - Let me get this straight. You make a barrel full of money, your husband's a dead beat, he fools around with other women, and you stay married? Haven't you ever heard of the word "divorce?" - Everything is community property. There was no way I was going to give him half of everything I worked my tail off for. Besides, I guess a part of me still loved him... - Did he love you? - Who knows? He lied and distorted nearly everything. I guess... he was what is known as a loser. - Okay, so someone killed your husband. Maybe what we should be concerned about... is them coming after you. - Mr. Mize? - Yes! - Follow me please. Here are the copies of Charles Sullivan's medical records. Ordinarily, I wouldn't release these. But since Katherine Sullivan was so insistent, I decided to bend the rules. Charles Sullivan was sterile? - Is there anything else, Mr. Mize? - I guess this has mean leaving. Thank you very much for your time, doctor. - [Muffled]: Sarah... Help, Sarah! - Katherine? Katherine, are you here? Katherine...? Are your okay? What happened? Are you okay? - I... I... got so hot... There was all that steam, I think I fainted. - Why didn't you open the door? - It was broken. - Watch that handle works itself loose. - It was tight, the last time I was in there. - And when was that? - Two days ago. - Maybe you better stick to swimming for a while. - What are you doing here? - Actually, I came here to get you to sign this release authorizing me access to your husband's fingerprints. - What are you going to do with his fingerprints? - The morgue needs a copy of them. You know, in case he came as a John Doe. - This is all too bizarre. The morgue. Phony cops. John Does... - It's pretty strange, I know. - Do you believe me? - Yes. - Really? - Really. - Sarah says the heating will be fixed by tomorrow. - This food is delicious. I didn't realize you're a Cordon Bleu chef. - I'm an amateur. - Not in my book. You make a meal like this often? - No, I usually eat out of the freezer, but I use to cook for Charles all the time. Then it seemed the more I stayed in the less he came home. - There's gotta be something wrong with a guy who won't come home for a meal like this. - Sarah and I do like to play amateur gourmet a couple times a week. There is something about the ritual that I enjoy. It's a little like going out. - This is better food than I never had in a restaurant. - Well, it's the least I can do. You saved my life, today. - You know, I've been doing some reading about agoraphobia. - Why? - Well, it's this case I'm working on. - Oh, Let's talk about politics or religion, okay? - I'm sorry. But don't you ever feel like going outside for a walk? Or go to a movie? Going for a drive in your car? - No. You see it's a trade off. You learn to put those things out of your mind in order to feel safe. Are you married, Jack? - No! - Girlfriend? - She dumped me. - May I ask why? - Well, this is, you know... The usual thing. I didn't put the cap back on the toothpaste, I left the toilet seat up... That kind of thing. [ Clock chimes ] Well, this meal has been wonderful, but... I really have to get going. - You're not leaving until you've had dessert. - I don't like desert. - You'll like this. - Strawberry tart's delicious. You're making a desert lover out of me. You know, your house is big, you really should have some children in it. - Yeah, well, we tried for a while, but it just never happened. About you, any kids? - No, no. My lifestyle doesn't really conduce at raising children. - Do you miss practicing law? - You've been investigating the investigator? - Just a little surfing on the Net. It's amazing what you can learn at home. - So, what did you learn? - After Princeton, you left school in Jersey. You graduated second in your class at Harvard Law. Went on to become a Legal-Aid lawyer. We don't have to talk about this if you don't want to. - No, no, its okay. You opened the door. So what else did you learn? - Just that you had a case that ended badly. - Ended badly? - What happened? - I don't really want to talk about it. - No, please. Tell me, I want to know. - All right! I got a homicidal rapist released from prison. - How did you do that? - Because I was such a brilliant lawyer. I discovered a legal technicality. The abridged version is that the cops didn't file this warrant properly. They put the wrong date on it. As a result, I was able to get the evidence tossed. In this case, a butcher knife with my client's victim's blood on it. No knife, no case. So, the charges were dropped, Two days later, Tyronne raped and tortured Sharon Simmons, Paula Crawford. And they suffered horrible deaths... I was responsible. - Wow! So you punishing yourself? - No. Now, that's why I stopped being a lawyer. - But you did a good job. You gave your client the best defense possible. - You're sweet. You should be a lawyer. - Except that I make a better swimmer. Come on, let's go get warm. - I told you I don't go in the water. - I know it's something you do to keep from drowning, right? You can dangle? Your toes. - Yeah, I'll just... sit here and... and dangle. - Well, I'm going into the nice warm water. Oh, come in! You'll freeze up there. - This is kinda nice. Well, kids all make an exception. You'll save me from drownin'? - You do swim. - Only when I'm forced. - Where are you going? - Aaaaah! - What's wrong? - Oh God, I hate spiders! Do something! I hate spiders. I absolutely loathe them! - It's okay, it's gone. - Where did it come from? - I don't know. Maybe... It was under the house and came in to get out of the cold. - What if there are more? - Here. It's okay. Come on... It's gonna be okay. - When...? Just hold me. Sometimes I get so lonely. - Now, we all do. [ Phone ringing ] Hello? - [ It's me. What are you doing? ] - Just trying to stay warm. - Is it working? - [ Not really. ] What are you doing? - Thinking about you. - [ Yeah... ] I've been thinking about you, too. - [ Why don't you come over? ] We'll keep each other warm. - We have a business relationship, here, Katherine, you know. - [ Its not what you taught ] last night. - That was special. - [ Yes, it was. ] Good night. - Good night, Katherine. [ Sharp snap ] [ Little creaks ] - Hello? Who's there? [ Little creaks ] [ Little creaks ] [ Little squeaks ] Aaaaah! Oooooh! Oooh! [ Phone ringing ] Jack Mize doesn't live... - [ Jack, get over here quick! ] - Oh Katherine... what? - [ There are rats in my bed! ] [ Jack, come here quick! ] - Okay, okay. What happened? - [ Disgusting rats! ] - Rats? I'll be right there. There's gotta be a logical explanation. - What about the lights? Why don't they work? - I don't know. Maybe a power failure. - I've never had rats in this house and now they're crawling all over the place and the spiders, and the sauna, and the... - You got to calm down. Maybe you just need a good night's sleep. - I can't sleep. - I'll be here. - Because I'm paying you? - No. Because I want to be here. [ Sharp snap ] - Did you hear that? - Hear what? - Shhhh! Listen. There's something in the house. I know this house. - I don't hear anything. - I know this house... [ Something drops off ] There is something that's in the kitchen. - Okay, you stay here. I'll go check it out. - I'm coming too. [ Sharp snap ] Did you hear that? [ Other noises ] It's coming from the kitchen! - It's okay... [ Sharp snap ] It's just the shutter. Come on... Come on! - So, see you tonight? - Yeah, maybe... - Maybe? - Well, I'll try. - I'm sorry... I overreacted. - No, I understand. I'll try to stop by about seven. Do you want me to give you a hand? - Do you sleep with her? - I think this is a conversation you'd be having with your sister. [ Doorbell ] You've been lying to me. - What's gotten into you? - This. - What? - You told me you couldn't get pregnant. - I told you I didn't have any children. - You misled me. - Look, I lost the baby. It's easier to say "I don't have children" than to go into it. I lost the baby. All right? - How'd your husband react when you lost the baby? - Can we stop talking about this? - How did your husband react? - He didn't. - He wasn't the father, was he? - What? - Who is the father? - Charles! - Stop lying to me! Please, just tell me the truth! Why did you make this whole thing up? About your husband dying. About the cops being here? - I didn't! - Charles was sterile! - He was what? - Sterile. I checked the medical records. Stop with this school girl routine, you know, and call me when you feel like telling me the truth. - Wait, Jack... I had an affair... - With who? - Someone from the brokerage house. It was stupid, it didn't even last very long. - You must've wondered who the father was. - I was so excited to be pregnant, I didn't even think about it. - What else have you lied to me about? - I didn't know I was lying. I never knew Charles couldn't have children. - Hey, Bob! - Didn't you get the message I left you? I said that I'd call you after Billy's practice. - I know, I know, here. - What's that, a bribe? - It's a gift for Billy. - Now, a gift my butt. - Hey, you remember that one Christmas when we were kids, when we both ge each other hockey sticks? - Oh, cut the bull, Mize. We never exchanged hockey sticks. - Yes, we did. You're just getting so old you don't remember stuff! - What I remember is saving your hide on the ice more times than I know. - That's cause you took it seriously. I was having fun. - Here. I tracked some stuff off the national crime computer on your shut-in. I don't know why I do this for you. - She has a record? - No, she's squeaky clean. She was on the other side of a nasty one, though. - Nasty what? - Assault. Some psycho with a mask carved her up with a straight-edge razor. The only reason she lived was because she was pregnant. The baby absorbed most of it. Her kid didn't make it though. - It's terrible. - Yeah... It happened 3 years ago? - Yep! That's when she decided to stay inside for good. I told you, don't get involved with your clients. See ya Jack. - Hey, Bob! For Billy. - Ha! Ha! He's a goalie. - A goalie? - I'm sorry I haven't been on top of things, Jared. Ay, here it is. We've about 500,000 on the fifth, that came due on... Oh, great, my comput's going haywire again... I don't know. I'll call you back. Oh, it's hot! Great! Oh, my God... [ Phone dial up ] Come over right now! Hurry, please! - You got the furnace fixed, huh? It's so hot in here. - They couldn't come. First, it's freezing, now it's boiling hot. Okay... Where'd it go? - Is it on? - Yeah! It was there! - Maybe you just thought you saw it. - Don't talk to me that way! I know what I saw. Maybe I am crazy! Maybe it is all in my head! No, it was there, I saw it! - I'm sure it was. - But I want you to believe me! [ Slight grating ] [ Door's shut ] What's that? - Might be your sister. - No, she's not coming until later. - Maybe she changed her mind. - Oh, Jack, someone's downstairs! - You stay here! And I mean it this time, Katherine. [ Broken glass sound ] Hey! - Who the hell are you? - You're Charles Sullivan? - Who are you, and what are you doing in my house? - You're really alive!? - I should think so. Where's my wife? How is she, doctor? - She's raving on, something about seeing you dead. - Seeing me dead! She's getting worse and worse. - I've sedated her. I've left you a prescription for some sedatives. - Isn't there something else you can do? - Goodbye, Charles. - I go salmon fishing in Ireland every year at this time. Katherine knows that. - I had no idea she was so ill. - Who, Katherine? She's been like this for a long time. In the beginning she'd pick up strangers and bring them to the house here. Then she got paranoid and agoraphobic and Dr. Eberson will tell you that we've tried everything we can to help her. That's when I had the security door built. - I'm sorry. I'll see myself out. - Oh! M. Mize... Look. I'm sorry you got mixed up in all of this. The other fellow... he was a personal trainer or something like that. Now... how do you charge, by the day or the hour? - What are you talking about? - Well... you know... For your services. I paid him. Don't worry, I'm gonna take care of you. - It's gotta be $500 here? - Yes, something like that. You mean it's not enough? - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Maybe he was a swimmer... or something like that. - You were standing on the stairs wearing what? - My boxers. - And his wife comes trotting in wearing...? - A sheet. - A sheet! - I wanted to crawl into a hole and disappear. Never, ever have I been so shocked to see someone. - I would have given a month's pay to see your face. So what'd Papa do, threaten to kick your butt? - Unh-uh. You know, the fact is, that's been bothering me all day. - What, that you didn't get your sorry self beat up? - No, that he didn't seem upset about Katherine and me. I mean, he said that his wife got a habit of picking up strange men. - Hey, they have a rotten marriage. Separate lives and all that stuff. - Yeah, but even when you got a rotten marriage and your wife has problems, you act a little funny when you meet the guy just got out of bed with her. I mean it's a little uncomfortable, right? This was like he expected me to be in bed with her. - Look, that broad, her husband and her sister are crazy. Like I told you, move on, Mize, it's freezing out here. I gotta get back to the station. - Something's not right here, Bob! I know it. - Will you give it up?! - I can't. - Sleep well, my sweet. - Charles, why are you doing this? - [Answering machine]: You have no new messages. [ Rrrring ] [ Rrring ] [ Persistent ringing ] - [ Hello? ] [ Hello? ] Wake up, sweetheart. Time for your pill. - Hmm? - Time for your medicine. - Charles, please stop. - Stop what? This is your medicine. It's good for you. Come on, now, wash it down. That's a good girl. Sleep tight. - This is my theory. This Sullivan guy set this whole thing up. He faked his own death and his "body's" disappearance. - Come on. What's his motive? - I don't know. He's trying to mess with her head, drive her out of their house. - He goes to all this trouble; hires phony cops, puts together phony cop cars just to mess with her head? - Yeah, it's something like that. I mean, it fits in with everything else. The spider, the rats. Everything going haywire in the house, the heat going on and off. He's trying to drive her nuts. - Okay. Why? - I don't know. May be he's trying to get her a file for a divorce. - Do you want to hear my theory, Jack? - Do I have a choice? - This Sullivan woman is not that crazy. She wants to dump her looser hubby so she creates a situation and she hires you to be fall guy. - How she can do that? - I don't know. - I like my theory better. - You need stronger motive... Goodbye Jack... Good luck! - What are you doing? - Shaving, of course! - Where did you get that? - This? Oh, Harry gave it to me on our fishing trip. Isn't it lovely? You know I've always wanted one. It's got a pearl handle and it's very sharp... You want to feel it? Oh, my goodness! You're frightened, aren't you? Here, let's get you back to bed. [ Phone ringing ] - Hello? - Yeah! It's Jack Mize. Can I speak to Katherine, please? - Mr. Mize, I've got my hands full right now. Please, don't call again. - Look, just give me a second will ya, I... - it's a, she's an Irish author, I really enjoy it. - You really like this author, huh? - I do. - Katherine what are you doing out of bed? - What did you do to my office? - Your office? You don't remember? You were the one who wanted an extension. - What extension? I don't know what you think you're doing, but won't get away with it. - Let me get that. - I've got it. It's all right. Here, here you go. Very nice. - No, Sarah. Not you... - Not me what, Kath? - You're in on it with Charles. - In on what? - Katherine, wait! - You get out of my house! - Sarah! Call Dr. Eberson now. - Jack... Are you here? - I'm not here... 'Night, Charlene. You can't dump me again. You've already done that once. - I've lost one of those expensive black shoes I have. I thought it might be here. - Haven't seen it. - You mind if I check the place for it? - Sure, go ahead, I don't think you'll have much luck. - Ya never know. What's that saying? "Where there's a will, there's a way." - Yeah, well, you'll have to have a lot of will to have that one come true. That's it! You are brilliant, Charlene. I owe you one. Close the do, will ya? - I don't care, I'm not sending her to some nut house. - No, that's not what I'm sgesting. I mean it's a lovely place, it's more like a home than an institution. - It's just got to be an alternative! - I'm sorry, Charles. They'll take excellent care of her. It could be expensive... - Look... look! I don't care what it costs. When it comes to Katherine, I want the best. Now, what do we have to do to make the arrangements? - Don't worry about it. I'll take care of it. I'll personally monitor Katherine. After all, I know how important she is to you. - I just wish there was some other way. - I'm afraid there's not... I'll call you. - I can't tell you how grateful I am that you came over this late tonight. - Bob Bob Bob, it's his motive. Look at this: Statute 23, section 2 of the Power of Attorney codes states. And I will read: "Pursuant to transference of all properties of individuals who are declared legally incompetent to administrate their affairs, next of kin is awarded power of attorney." - Look, I'd love to sit here and shoot holes in this cockamamie theory of yours, but Billy's got a game in about 30 minutes. - Bob, you've got to arrest Sullivan. - What crime has he committed? Huh? You're the lawyer, you tell me. - I don't know what it's got... but it's gotta be something. - Look. You get this guy breaking the law and I'll be all over him, like this babe, if you ever give me her number, but Jack, you got nada. - Bob! You got to help me! - I told you. The girl's number. - Charlene. You two are meant for each other. - Charlene... All right! [ Phone ringing ] - Hello? - [Don't hang up on me, Sullivan.] [I figured out your little game.] - Game, Mr Mize? There is no game here. I'm busy right now. - [With what? Trying to have your wife committed?] [So you can get your hands on her money?] - That's a very ugly accusation, Mr. Mize. [You know, if you don't stop calling here, ] I'll be forced to get a restraining order. - Jack, some guy is up in your place. - What does this guy looks like? - A big dude. He smells like perfume. - Thanks! - Come on. Let's dance! - I don't dance. [ Struggling ] - Wake up darling. Time for another pill. What is the matter? You've got to get control of yourself. You've got to calm down. We're doing everything we can to help you. Dr. Eberson is even got you this wonderful facility. - No! [Sighs] Ow! - What have you done, now? Let me see, let me see. - Albert Heyes. Actor? Stuntman. Surprise, surprise. It's quite a performance you gave us, Detective Sergeant Sandestin. - I played a lot of cops when I was in L.A. - Bad ones, Albert. How much did Sullivan pay you? - Hey, I didn't do anything wrong. Just a little acting. - How do I know you're not acting right now? - I'm telling you the truth. Aarghh! - There aren't too many parts for actors with mangled legs. We're gonna play a little game. It's where I ask you a question, and you answer me. If it's not an answers that I like... I'm gonna wack you on your knee. Are you ready? How much did Sullivan pay you? - Who's Sullivan? - Aaaarrgh! Okay, okay. Ten grand. - You're the creep that attacked Mrs. Sullivan 3 years ago, right? I'll do it again. You cut up Mrs. Sullivan when she was pregnant, didn't you? - Aaaargh... Yeah, Sullivan hired me to scare her. He didn't tell me she was pregnant. I just pulled the damned razor and she turned into it. - You're scum, you know that? - I'm just an unemployed actor. - Pathetic. They were right. You do stink. - Aaaaargh! - Come on... Come on... - Katherine? - Don't come any closer. - You're shivering. Must be the cold. Remember our honeymoon in Paris? It was cold then too. It was snowing and it was so beautiful! - I told you stop! - That w before you stopped making love to me, - Charles, stop right there! - Come on, now, Kath. You won't stab me. No. Come on. It's all over. Give it up. - [Muffled]: Katherine! Oh, God! When I'll get out of here... Katherine! You need me! Let me out! Please! - Yeah, my battery is dead. How soon can you get here? No, I, I know it's freezing outside. Please, can you just hurry? Okay, my address is 22045 Queen street. Yes, please, just hurry! - Katherine? - Katherine... Open up! - Come on, please! There's got to be some cab in this city that can get here. Pl... Hello? - [Charles' muffled screams]: Katherine? - Katherine? What are you doing? - Your crazy sister locked me in there. - What happened to your arm? - She cut me. - What's going on? - She's gone over the edge, that's what's going on. And we got to find her. Come on. You go that way. - I can't find her. - Look in the living room. I'll look in the office. Katherine? Katherine? Katherine? - She's not in the living room. - She's not in here either. - I'm here. - Kath, put those down. - You two won't get away with this. - Get away with what? - What is this conspiracy that you insist on seeing? - You stay right there. The earring proves it. - Proves what? - I never saw it before. - The first one I found it in Charles' dry cleaning. - But it's not mine. - It fell out of your purse. - Charles is the one who found it. He picked it up off the floor. - Don't listen anything she says. She's out of her mind. - I'm not out of my mind! - Katherine... come on. Give me the scissors, Katherine. - Don't you move. Katherine... Give me the scissors. Now. - You weren't involved with him? - Of course not. He must've had the earring all along. - Oh, Sarah, I'm so sorry I didn't believe you! Where's Charles? - We need a real weapon. The razor. - There it is, there's the razor. - Aaaah! Aah! Aaah! Aaaah - Come on! [ Engine won't start up ] [ Starting engine ] - Close the hood! - Aaaah! - Aaaaaarrrh! - Sarah. Sarah, Sarah... Sarah!!! Look what you've done... Call an ambulance. - What I've done? No, what you've done. - What?! - Who do you think they gonna believe? Me, or a disturbed person like you? - Help, she needs an ambulance! - Where are you going? Oh, you're going to the door... You gotta go out! Yes... you can do it. Go ahead! Go ahead! Open the door, go out, you can do it! Feel the cold on your face. You'll love it. Go ahead. - Nooo! - Why don't you get some fresh air? Time for little walk, isn't it? Go ahead, do it... You can't, can you? It's so pathetic. [ She screams in terror ] [ Sighs ] [ She screams in terror ] [To herself]: I can do this. - Looking for these? - Jack, call me right away! I'm in Charles' car. 555-0117. - Aaaaaah! - Sarah?! Sarah? - Please... I need help! - Here, I brought you coffee. - Thank you. - Okay. - Kelsey... Burgundy Volvo in stone hole quarry? Any survivors? Okay, I'll be right there. I just found the car your husband was driving. - And Charles? - It's look like he didn't make it. - Katherine... I just got in. - Give me a second? - I'll be right back. What? I gotta check the Volvo... its totalled. I do admit it, Jack, but you were right... Take care of her, huh? - Ya I will. Are you all right? - Yeah, I'll be okay. Glad you're here. - Come on, I'll take you home. - It's strange, I haven't left my home in 3 years. It's funny to be going back. - I bet. Here. - And Sarah? - Yeah, I'm afraid so... Come on. Come on, let's go. - I don't feel safe here anymore, let's go to your place. - You don't want to go in my dump. - I can't survive here without Sarah. - You didn't think you'd survive outside and you did, right? I'm here. You're safe with me. - Thanks... I'm gonna go take a hot bath. - Okay. I'll make you some tea. Chamomile okay? - Yes. I forgot something. Jack! - What? - He's here! He's in the house! - Who is...? - Charles! The razor's gone! - Razor? - It's gone! - You got to calm down... No one can survive that crash. - Aaaaah! - Argh! [ Sighs ] - Grab the razor! Grab it! - No! - Grab it! - Aaah! - Aaarrhh... Come on Katherine. You don't want to hurt me. You love me and I love you! We can put all this behind us and start over. Give me the razor. Please. Come on... Good girl. - Jack... Jack, you're okay? - Yes... Where... is he...? - Yes. It's finally over. - How is it going? - Almost finished. These haven't been tended to for years. I forgot how much I enjoy gardening. - I think that maybe we should go upstairs and check the plants in the bedroom. - No. - Come on. Not while there's still light in the sky! I wanna go hike through the forest, see the ocean. I want to walk along the river and feed the ducks... Come on, Jack, it'll be fun! - I think I liked you better the other way. - What? - No, I just said... Yes, I'm coming, I'm coming. Closed-captioning by: Global Vision
