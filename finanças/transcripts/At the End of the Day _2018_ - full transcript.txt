Uh huh, the door is bigger than the entire room. You stole my title. One of the best student papers I ever read. How do you do it? Well, when you're in chapel five days a week, you got a lot to pull from. Most of us used to swipe our card and leave anyways. Until that landed you and your buddies in front of my disciplinary board. You really should not have run from the campus cops. I just couldn't take another installment of Dr. Nessey's, The Four Voices of the Tishbite. The tortures of the damned, my friend. What ever happened to him? His wife left him for a woman. I'm sorry, I didn't mean... It's too soon, right? That's all right. At least she left me the car, right? And the car payments and the student loans - and the... - That's, that is all behind you.

Yeah, I need to report a dead body. Gotcha, Dave. Gotcha. I've been waiting weeks to do this. What took you so long? Good morning, everyone. Good morning. My name is Mr. Hopper. Welcome to Psych 101. Now, as far as I'm concerned the basis for our understanding of human behavior can clearly be found in the Bible, and that's where we'll begin. Now we're gonna start each class by answering one question. Any question, I will give you my honest black and white answer. Give me something tough. Anything. Mr. Uh? Nate. Why does God hate gay people? There it is. The issue of your generation, the gays. We hear things like it's the new normal, an acceptable lifestyle, and that Christians, and others who oppose that practice are homophobic. Nate, I'm not afraid of homosexuality, I just know that it's wrong. It destroys people and families. I've seen it. Come in. What's this? Building a house? Uh huh, for the psych department. We have a psych department? Not yet. We wanna get the Cash Feed property over on Wabash, have it ready for the fall. Oh yeah, love that building. Who's gonna head it? I was hoping that you would. I've taught like one class. Nobody cares. You've got real-world experience. You're young, you're committed. Board eats that sort of stuff up. What? It's ridiculous, I'm starting to think we may not be able to get it. Well, what ever happened to attempt great things, expect great things? There's a support group, okay? The recently deceased owner of the property willed it to them as long as they could raise money to pay the back taxes, and it's only rumors, I have no way of knowing for sure, but it sounds like they're getting close. Is there no other building? Not like that. Not at that price or with that history. It's breath-taking. It smells good in there, Patty. Do you need any help? Do you like vajatas? What? Vajatas. Do you like them? Fajitas, I love fajitas. That's what I said. Go have a seat. Let me go check out the group. Hmm? The support group, just check it out. Not say anything, find out how close they are to the money. I don't know, Dave. That sounds a little deceitful. It's research. Where do they meet? Over by that hippie church on Main Street. I think. Hi, are you here for the group? I think so. Great! Come on in. That's how it works. Hey, am I at the right place? It depends, are you gay? It's not a trick question. Your shirt says you are, come on. Hey guys, Alyssa's gonna be late so I'm gonna lead discussion tonight. Oh, no he didn't! Yes, right in the middle of service! We were at the alter-call-thing and the pastor says to me, with his mic on, are you a lesbian? Girl, he didn't. And I said, I'm not here for sex, I'm here for salvation and I'll go find it elsewhere, thank you. That was like eight years ago though, babe. More things are much better now, more accepting. Some of us are changing. I guess, let's start like usual, everyone says their name and why they're here. Rosa, can you start? My name is Rosa and I'm here to support my wife, although I don't think it's worth the cost of a baby sitter. And to make sure she grows up in a less hateful world than we did. Bruce? Hello, my name is Bruce. And I've been a member of the gay community my whole life. Hi everyone, I'm Richard, and I'm here to love on my family. That's what you are, you're my family. His family doesn't like him. Well, I'm Kyle, and I've been questioning my sexuality for about four years now. He's not gay. I'm Mark, I'm the pastor at the church next door. I love people, that's why I'm here. What about you? Mm-hmm. Oh, uh, I don't really... It's okay to just start with your name. Right, oh okay. Um, my name is Dave. Just moved here a few days ago. Uh, living with my aunt and I don't like to talk about my sexuality. It's okay, we all understand. We're really glad you're here. We've all been there. Erika, do you wanna go? Pass. We can do that? Okay. Does anyone have anything they need support with tonight? That little shit behind the counter did it again. Every time I go to that gas station on the corner I catch him spewing his hate! Your god is love, bitch, why can't you be? It's okay. Hi. Hi. Not gay. I just got back from the attorney's office, and we're all set to go on the property. We just need to get the money to cover the taxes and it's ours! Well, how much money do we need? $50 thousand in 30 days and we're at about 10. We need everyone at the car wash, everyone. Yes, please. Uh, sorry, car wash? Yeah, yep, a car wash. It just seems like a lot of cars to wash. Honey, you have not seen us wash cars. Okay? Right. Girl. Okay, on you. We'll see you soon. - All right, now. - Okay. Only one cookie now. I deserve it, thank you, okay? I'm Dave. Sorry, I'm so sorry. Mm-hmm. I had to do something about your shirt. So I hear you're not... Not what? Uh, afraid of a challenge. No. 40,000 in three weeks. This shelter is gonna happen. Shelter? It's for everyone who needs a place to feel safe. Well, isn't that what Good Shepherd's for? Not if you're gay, darling. Bruce, have you met Dave? Yes, we have, we met at the circle. And Dave is new to town, he is single, and he lives with his aunt. And he hasn't talked about sexuality much though. Oh, that's understandable. It gets better. Be seeing you, Dave. Oh. Why didn't you tell me? Do they have it? Did you know? Do they have it? - No, they don't. - Excellent. Not even close. Gordon, it's a gay group. All right, that would have been nice to know. That would have been great to know actually and you know you'd think they want it for a gay bar or maybe some sort of sex house. But they want it for a homeless shelter. Did you know that? No Dave, how could I know that? And so what if they want it for a homeless shelter? You want those poor kids taken off the street taken by sodomites? - No. - No, of course not. But like I said they're unorganized. All they have are car washes. You haven't seen gays wash cars. I will this weekend. Will what? You're going back? Why would you you do that? Because what if I... Sabotage it? Jesus flipped over tables and whipped sinners to rid the temple of evil. Desperate times, my brother. Ha, great idea. So who's got a question today? Yes, Nate. Does a person choose to be gay? Wow, obsessed? Okay, well it's complicated, but in most cases, the psycho-social choice can be traced back to some kind of abuse or negative impact growing up. Call it a distant father, an overbearing mother. Sometimes it's as simple as a gay man has never had a chance to be with a woman, hindering his sexual development. So they're attracted to the same sex because they never kissed the opposite sex? Psycho-social. When have you kissed a man? I'm sorry? I don't know, maybe you don't know you're gay. Maybe if you kissed a man you'd find you really like men. Stop it. Patty? Patty? I ain't Patty. Holy, clearly. Who are you? Frank. You must be Dave, Patty tells me you don't know how to please a woman. Um, okay Frank, that is none of your business and it's mostly untrue. Ain't nobody ever told you how to be a 60 minute man? Um... A 60 minute man. 15 minutes a cuddling, 15 minutes a smooching, 15 minutes a rubbing... Whoa, okay, wow. Thank you, please stop though. Why are you here, Frank? I'm whatcha call Patty's friend with benefits. We share our Social Security income and meds. I give her my downers and she gives me her uppers. Okay. Where is she? Frank. I tell you what, you go give her these pills, but you gotta wear this. Um, mm, I don't... Oh, it'll freak her out. She's all the time pullin' crap with me and she'll get you before long? She already did. Here's your chance. Gonna regret this. Mm-hmm. It's a bad idea. Bad, bad idea. Frank, where you at? Frank, I'm ready for you. - Oh! - Oh no. No. Gotcha Patty! Frank. At night? Woo, our first customer! Your wash will be for free, handsome, but then you gotta help. Okay, none of this makes sense.

And you guys, you've got it the hardest. Raising that girl. No greater responsibility. How does it feel to know that your support group thinks you're not gay? Hmm. If it were me, I'd find a place I was more accepted. I look at you and I look at everyone else around here, don't near cares like you do. Where's their passion? I see it in your eyes. Don't see it in theirs. You've been here what, a year? Still no gender neutral bathrooms. Must be tough. Do they have to get childcare or do homework? Get their kid to school? Nope. You know why? They're too busy having fun. What is it I've been saying, for the love of God, pick a side already. But I'm so gay I make circles look straight. There's always been this voice telling me that. You know, inside my head, I just don't want to believe it. It's true. Dude, I use the ladies room. Right. Hey, how's everyone doing? That's funny that you ask. I just wish everyone would care as much as I do! Don't act like we're not sitting here with a bunch of hypocrites. Do not talk to us like that. Bruce, apologize to Erika. Y'all, snap it together! Get your lives. Do I have to remind you? This is not who we are. We're together because no one else wants us and to make sure we're there for others who don't have anyone else either. Erika, honey, we know you've gone through so much and have grown stronger for it. That's why we love you. Bruce, you keep your close-minded hate to yourself. Miss Gina, Miss Rosa, you're doing a beautiful thing with Chloe, but that blessing was your choice, okay? Yeah. And Kyle, poor child, you are not gay. So let it go, boo boo. We still love you. All right, good. So, the numbers are in from the car wash, and it's bad. It's like $130 bad. Uh-huh. But we washed like a thousand cars! Yeah, we charged $20 a pop! But after the accident with lights and the sound system, we didn't make enough. Kyle! I told you I didn't touch it. It's fine, it's okay. Everyone had fun and people learned about the shelter, so that's good. We also have the 5k next week, so that'll help. Speaking of which, after group I need help making signs, any volunteers? Uh, I could, if nobody else wanted to. Okay. Bruce kinda told me you're not gay. Kind of? Well he mouthed it to me at my first meeting. Well that man does too many things with his mouth. So? No. Oh, no? Um-hmm. Then why the meetings? For support. Seems like you do more than support. You kinda run the place. Yeah. How long have you lived here? I'm actually from here. Yeah, I um, just moved back a few days ago. Well three years ago, before me, there was another guy that ran the group, Ryan. He was confident, handsome. Great with people, very gay. A little bit like you. The shelter was his dream. He would bring in homeless teens off the street and try and get them in at Good Shepherd, but their sponsors didn't want the gays hurting their image. The image of a homeless shelter. So he would take them to the shelter in Orlando. Mark volunteers there sometimes. And then Ryan realized that there is enough gay youth here that we needed our own place. So what happened to him? One night he was locking up after group, some guys jumped him. They found him the next morning. Beaten, and strangled with a rainbow flag. He was my brother. That's why I'm here. To make his dream real. You know? Bruce was right. You are kinda cute. What? It's too bad you're gay. Excuse me? You're just so refreshing. So many new people feel the need to overemphasize their sexuality. What I love about you is you don't have to try, your gayness just flows naturally. Do you have any idea what I would do to you if you were straight? Your gayness flows naturally? Not funny man, they think that I'm gay! All of them? Apparently, something about not having to force my sexuality. Look Dave, this is a good thing. They trust you now, you gotta keep 'em trusting you. What? They want me to go to some place called The Closet. It's a gay bar, Dave. A very classy place. Phenomenal. Should I go? Absolutely, the door is wide open, Dave. Get in there and strike. You be careful okay? Make sure you bottle up that natural gayness of yours. You look so handsome. Just like Frank. Perfect. First date since Samantha? It's not a date. Don't come back fore 10. You might see something you don't want to. Yep, looks pretty gay to me. Hey. Hey. Wow, you really clean up nicely. Thanks. You are... also wearing clothes. Yeah, you like? That scarf though. - No. - Uh. I'm glad you came out tonight. Yeah, uh, and thanks for inviting me. I haven't really been out since Sam... left me for a woman. He did? Oh, Dave. Yep, a woman. Two timing man-whore. Mm-hmm. I don't know, I guess I took it pretty bad. I feel like I must not have been enough man to leave Sam the only choice of switching sides. Most days are okay though, but then all it takes is seeing an old photo, or I could be at a movie and reach over, but realize there's no hand. Ah I just wish I could hold your hand one more time, Sama... man. Sam-a-man, I used to call him Sam-a-man because he was so much man. Good evening Alyssa. Hi, Jason. Here you go. Deep breath. Ready? Um. Come on. ♪ ♪ I see what they did there. ♪ ♪ Not as gay as I expected. Give it time. How does a straight woman fit into a gay bar? They don't mind? No, they don't mind as long as I follow the straight girl rules. My vagina has no power here. I mean the straight girls are used to getting free drinks and being the center of attention at bars. That doesn't happen here. Makes sense. Straight guys can be here too. They just need to need to know that around midnight that's when the party can get a little crazy. How crazy are we talking? You'll see. What does that do to a person? I've just never been hurt that way, you know? I saw things no one should ever see. Disturbing stuff. I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy. And then Frank, that old dirty bastard. He was downstairs laughing. Yeah. I'll never look at my Aunt Patty the same way again. She sounds amazing. No, she is a dirty old witch is what she is.

This is the zebra house, where "sexually unacceptable" teens go when their parents or God kicks them out. I'm intersex, it means I'm not biologically male or female. My insides are kind of a mix up. But I was raised in the Christian church and I get to hear all these sermons about man and woman. When I'm not strictly either. I identify as gender-fluid, which means that I believe that I am both male and female. I didn't fit into the exact binary that people thought I should. That my mom thought I fit into. That physically I should have. The first time that I thought something was different, I was probably about nine. I was in Catholic school since I was five years old. Actually got kicked out for coming out as gay at that point in my life. When I was 11, I used to fight with my mom about wanting to wear my brother's clothes 'cause I had four brothers. I have seven siblings. I knew back then that something about me was way more masculine than just feminine. People ask me, they're like oh, so you're gay and I'm like no, not gay. It's always one of the first questions I get or the normal question of "What do you have in your pants?" I just kind of roll my eyes and I answer people. I'm like what does it matter though? My family aren't as loving as they say they are. Even though they say that they do not judge others and they love thy neighbor, that might be true, but just not when it's in the family, you know? I used to cry out to God and ask him why, why did, if he formed me in the womb, why did he choose to form me in this way. My mother has allowed me back into her house, but she's like I don't care if you like girls, just don't be someone who's transgender. Just don't mess with your gender, you know. That's how God made you. You've already proven that something's wrong by liking the same sex. This person that I am, Christina isn't this body, it's me, it's a voice that I hope can speak to this world. I love my mother, though. She is a wonderful woman. I think the world of her and I'll always love my mommy. Even if she doesn't want me to call her mommy one day. Just have a hard time having to sit around with my family as they're all happy with one another and knowing that they don't feel that way about me. Not knowing what they say about me when I'm not around. What does my mom tell her friends and her family that I'm doing? I learned that she doesn't even tell 'em that I'm homeless. I wonder what my mom tells all her friends. I wonder what's her idea of a perfect child. And I wish that I was good enough to be that child worth just telling people about. I just come to hang out on nights and weekends. This is, this is the only place where I feel like I have a voice, you know? Like I actually matter. I'm sorry. Nate, Nate. What are you doing here? Were you following me? No. So you're here with them. How's that gonna look to the administration? Look, you can't tell anybody I was here. Is that really what you came out here to say? Why am I gonna tell them, huh? Oh hey, Dr. Woodman, I was at my afternoon gay house when your puppet came visiting. Oh why were you at that gay house, Nate? Because I'm gay. Yeah, I'd be done. We could help you. Help, seriously? I've heard a month of your help. No thank you. And you know what, don't worry. I'm not gonna tell anyone your little secret. Can't have anyone knowing you've been spending time with the unforgivable. Nate. Nate! I had no idea. Why would you, huh? All you do is answer the questions, you never ask any. I don't have any answers right now. But I think... You know what, I don't know what to think either. But this place, it's good and I feel like you should stay. Call from Hot Sweet Muffin. That's rather inappropriate. Call from Hot Sweet Muffin. And gross. It's coming from your pocket. Call from Hot Sweet Muffin. It's my aunt. Hello? Patty, I told you, you need to take it easy. You know a hug would go a lot further than words right now. You don't understand, she's just always... You know what, nevermind. This girl doesn't know how to have fun. Every time she thinks it's an emergency. Well look, Patty, take it easy, get some rest, okay? Thank you. The paramedic said you passed out! You all right? Tell me something great you did today. Today has not been great. Bull shit, tell me then a small great. Learned a new game. Ah good, will you teach it to me? No. Oh it sounds bad. What were you doing when you got the call? I was unraveling a bandage and pouring salt into student's deepest wound. Have you seen my silk flowers? You can't miss 'em. I had Frank plant them years ago. For the emphysema? Just wanted my flower beds to look beautiful all year long, no matter the season. Except they look fake. Most people go their whole lives, thinking they can be silk flowers. They love the beauty of summer without the growth of spring, and the death of winter, or the doubts of fall. My favorite part is the line where the black and white meet. It's clear, it's obvious, there's no gray and no doubt. I'm not so sure doubt's such a bad thing. I'm late for class. So why don't I join you. Good morning, everyone. Carry on. Hi. Morning, everyone. Morning. Let's continue with Behavioral Psychology. What about the question today? Right, question. Who's got a... How is the gay thing different from slavery? Or oppression of women? I'm sorry? The Bible has been used to support both of those things. Before the Civil War, slavery was supported by white pastors saying that slaves should respect their masters. And men have always used the new testament to keep women silent in the church. How do we know that homosexuality is different than these things the church used to support with Scripture? Nate, these are complicated issues. Now, pardon me. Um, Nate, is it? Yeah. Nate, you are absolutely right. The Bible has been misused time and again to justify racism, slavery, and the oppression of women, even calling it God's work and that is shameful, absolutely shameful. All right? But as you start to closely study scripture, you're gonna find that there has always been this tension, this opposing narrative that actually calls for women to be in leadership and denounces slavery as contrary to God's will. Dig in there, read it closely, you are gonna find it, I promise you. However, even though some people try to bend scripture to fit their own personal beliefs, there is no narrative anywhere in the Bible that affirms homosexuality or calls it anything other than a sin. But love is the ultimate message of the Scriptures, right? Uh-huh. If we love, then aren't we kinda stuck affirming our gay friends? Okay. Nate, we have certainly made plenty of mistakes, and gays who think they're Christians have suffered at the hands of the Church. Which many times has failed to treat them with compassion, but we all know that God's ways are best, right? We agree on that, we believe it. And the greatest expression of God's love is to speak his truth. Case closed. Have a blessed day. Okay. So what's important to remember here. Nate, what are you... Nate. Hey guys, Rosa and I wanna invite you to Chloe's birthday party on Saturday. It's over on that new place at Clompton, with the weird inflatable things. Hey, are you sure you want a bunch of old folks attending her 10th birthday party? Her friends will be there, too, but when we asked who she wanted, she said her 2nd family and that would be you guys. Please say you'll come. Of course, we'd be honored. Thank you. Okay, now to business. We are not even close. We need 32,000 in two weeks. So time to brainstorm. Give me what you got, there are no bad ideas. Hey, listen to this. We find the biggest church in town, we have a huge bake sale in front of their doors, we all wear T-shirts that say "Youth Group." All right, I mean who's gonna know? I was wrong. No. What about a town hall meeting? You know a chance to tell people why we need this, how it's gonna help. We could set up a open mic, give people the opportunity to voice their opinion. So they can tell us they hate us to our faces. I don't know about that. Oh I don't know, I think we have more support than you think. Yeah, we're running out of options here. This could work. We can do a silent auction at the same time. Yeah, I mean if we're going to hear hater's hate, we might as well take their money too. Are you sure you can handle that? I don't think we have a choice. Hey. When's the last time you've been out of the house? ♪ Easily the most emotional of all emotions ♪ ♪ Obsession manifested but disguised as devotion ♪ ♪ Well I guess it's just too soon ♪ ♪ To say we're never gonna make it ♪ ♪ 'Cause I been around the world ♪ ♪ And yeah, it's oh so full of hatred ♪ ♪ But there's love ♪ ♪ We already know that it's all we need ♪ ♪ There's love ♪ ♪ And I don't wanna know where we'd be ♪ ♪ No without love ♪ Oh yes. Yes! This is so good. - Let's go, c'mon. - Oh. Yeah, come with mommy. This was perfect. Thank you. Yeah, you want more? No, I can't have any more. But I have to go to the ladies room. You got it? Mm-hmm. That's bullshit. Are you kidding me? And they're just telling you now? No, it's just, it's just wrong. Well, we are gonna work it out. And we're gonna find something even better. Of course, love you, too. Bye. Didn't sound good. Nope. The inflatable place just canceled Chloe's party! No! Yeah, the whole bullshit about not wanting to support that lifestyle. You do have friends. Yeah. Patty, this is Alyssa, Alyssa, my aunt Patty. Hot Sweet Muffin. So nice to meet you. It's nice meeting you. Is everything okay? Uh, not really, um, some of my friends, well our friends just found out their daughter's birthday party has just been canceled. Oh why? A location thing. Well she can have it at my house. - Really? - Uh-uh. - Yes. - I wouldn't wanna impose. Oh we have a big house. It's not real big. That's great, they'll be thrilled! How many people can you take? Three, four. Everyone! I love parties! Okay great, we will bring everyone then. - All of you. - Thank you. This is huge, I appreciate it. Hey guys, sorry I'm late. All right. Nate, what do you got for me today? Anybody seen Nate? Where is he? Hi Dave, how are you? Where is he? Where's who? Nate. Nate is no longer with us at Lakeside. Don't tell me you didn't know. He can't be here, all right? How can we help him by ignoring him? We're not ignoring him Dave, we're confronting him with his need to change. Oh for heaven's sake, look, you've lost sight of the truth. I told you to stop going to the group. You've already done plenty of damage. No. Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait, wait! Come on. You know this is a children's party, right? Doesn't have to be. Perfect, thank you. Oh. Hey, I, um, give you a heads up about my Aunt Patty. So excited to meet her! No. Yes I am. What I mean is she's kinda up there in age, ya know? - Not really... - Woo. With us. Girl, you look beautiful! You must be Patty. Thank you. This is a gift. Sorry I'm late. That fudge packer at the grocery store took forever. They're here, come on. Oh come on, Miss Patty! Don't get your vintage Chenille all snagged up, girl. What is he doing here? I needed my uppers! Shh! Sorry. Girl. Sorry. Okay guys, remember this was thrown together last minute, so we have to appreciate what we have, okay? Okay. Surprise! You guys! This is too much. This is just right.

Your town hall meeting is a go. It's Friday night at my church. Really? I thought that was kind of a bad idea. People might not like you shoving the gay agenda in their face. Seriously, the radical gay agenda? The only agenda I have is to love the unloved. Those kids who get kicked out of their homes in the name of religion or moral superiority. They don't even know what love looks like. They're labeled an outsider, or a queer, or worse. I like to imagine what would be possible if we chose to love rather than label people. He did these himself? He and his ex did them together. Oh, well they'd look great with some color. I thought you left. Oh, I was going to, but Aunt Patty invited me to stay for dinner. Isn't that be nice, Dave? Yeah, very nice. Could I borrow you real quick, Patty? - Excuse me. - Yeah. What are you doing? I've seen the way - you look at her. - Shh. It's not a good time, okay? It's complicated. Samantha? Don't say her name, please. Ooh. She's a lesbian! Look at how progressive I am, having a lesbian for dinner! Or does she swing both ways? Isn't that what you young men like these days? So, Aunt Patty, Frank seems like quite a catch. He keeps me young. You two ever hook up? Oh, no. We do have sex though. This was a great idea. Dave never told me you could cook like this. Dave. I don't talk about my personal life. He talks in his sleep, though. You should hear him talk about Sam... Patty. Uh-mm. Okay, we won't talk about Sam. Oh, how long have you two known each other? Um, we've known each other a few weeks. No, I meant you and Saman... Mm. This broccoli is so good. No, I've never met Sam. Just know what little Dave has told me. Oh, I thought by the way you said the name, that you had known h... Broccoli. No, never net him. I don't, I don't think, I don't think that's how you... Got it. You okay? They were such a sweet couple. And then that tramp ripped Dave's heart right out of his chest and pounded on it. Genius. What'd I do? No, the silk flowers, they always stay colorful. Oh yeah, something about the emphysema, real ones make it worse. I love that woman. You're lucky to have her. So lucky. Good night, Alyssa! Dave hasn't had this much fun since Samantha left. Who's Samantha? My ex-wife. Say that again? Samantha is my ex-wife. And by wife you mean a gender neutral term for your male partner? You lying bastard. Wait, wait, hold on, hold on! I said she was a man because, I've never talked about anything like that before. And I didn't think that you would believe I've lived as a straight guy all those years. I didn't. That shit happens all the time, why wouldn't we believe you? I don't know, I'm an idiot. My therapist says I need to work on my past by giving people a second chance. That's good advice. Shut up. I will not, let you get me this mad. I'm sorry. Yes, you are. ♪ I am a phony posing as a phonyless ♪ ♪ Person ♪ Mr. Hopper? Oh, yeah? Sorry, Taylor, read the scripture. Do not be fooled. Those who sin sexually, worship idols, take part in adultery, those who are male prostitutes, or men who have sexual relations with other men, those who steal, are greedy, get drunk, lie about others, or rob these people will not inherit God's kingdom. ♪ I am a phony posing as a phonyless ♪ ♪ Person ♪ You know, absolutely, you will be the very first person I call. Of course. All right, have a good day, goodbye. Have a seat, Dave, you're making me nervous. I'm done. You're done for the day or? Forever, I'm done. This is because of Nate? Why does this mean so much to you? Because, Gordon, Nate matters. Things we do matter. The things that we say, they matter. Think about this, Dave. - I have. - Have you? Where you gonna work? Where are you gonna go? To your girlfriend who thinks you're gay? Your crazy Aunt Patty? We have to stand for the truth, man, because nobody else will. Love speaks the truth. That's the only way we can fix him. He's not broken! Dave, have you thought about who your new friends really are? The scriptures are very clear on this. They're right there next to the idolaters and the adulterers. This is who you're supporting now. Support? You want to talk to me about support? Okay. How was I supported when the church turned their back on me after Samantha left, huh? When I heard whispers and those Christian parents who boycotted my practice because, according to them, I allowed my own wife to be perverted. That's not okay. So let's talk about this list of sinners. The cheats, the greedy, the idolaters. When I look at Erika, Bruce, Kyle, and Nate. I don't see the people who have anything to do with that list. I see, I see a love I never saw here. So you can keep your psych department. Dave. It actually sounds really nice, this place you've found. I'm sure it feels good. And I'm sure you think it's some new kind of enlightenment. But it's not real, Dave and I can't go there with you. I can't ignore the truth. There's no love without it. Good evening. Thank you for coming out tonight. I would like to introduce my good friend, Alyssa. Thank you again for spending your evening with us. For those of you who don't know me. My name is Alyssa Cane. My brother was Ryan Cane. You all know the story. We are here tonight to finish what he started, so that such hate would never be a part of this town again. So we are launching a Zebra House at the Wabash property down the street. A shelter for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender teens could go when they have no other place to turn. We understand this is a new concept for our area, and you might have some questions and we're here to answer them. As well as ask for your financial support because we can not do this without you. Thank you. With that, the microphone is open. Hi, I'm Nate. I've been to a place like this before in Orlando, without that place, I wouldn't be here today. It saved my life. Thank you. I'm not really good with mics, I'll just stay here. That's okay. I don't get the whole gay thing, I never have. But, that doesn't mean it's not a real issue. These kids, they don't deserve to live on the streets because of something they can't control. I'm in your corner for a hundred dollars. Yes. Thank you. I'm here as a woman married to a man, the way it should be. You all seem nice, but I can't support you. I wish it was different, I really do, but I can't change what the Bible says. I know you'll think this is hate. But I don't hate you. I love you. I just can't stand by and let you ruin the sanctity of marriage. Oh for the love of God. Mrs. Waters, thank you for your comment really, and even though tonight we're not talking about marriage equality, I want to personally apologize to you that it's destroying the sanctity of your third marriage. Oh, no she didn't. I've been learning in class about black and white, and this is certainly a black and white issue. It's a perversion, an unnatural lifestyle that leads to destruction. My Bible is very clear when it says we need to separate ourselves from such evil. Look, I'm sorry, ma'am. But it's the truth. Your brother was an abomination. It's the truth. 1 Corinthians 6:9, 10. It's in the Bible. That, that's enough. That's enough! That's not love. That's not God. Mr. Hopper? What are you doing? You know this kid? Yeah, he's my professor at Lakeside Christian. He taught me that. You, you taught me that. Everything I just said came from you. I don't understand. Have you been playing both sides the entire time? I'm gonna get a little more mean about this. I'm just saying you guys are being way too nice. All I'm saying is that from now on maybe we should be a little bit more careful about who we let in. Preacher, you need to pray for him. I will, Richard, I will. How are you not angry? Calm down. I'm not gonna calm... If you tell me to calm down. You son of a bitch! Are you even gay? Oh my god. I knew it, I knew it. What about the car wash? That was you! And he blamed him. - Come on. - That was Dave? Piece of shit. You see. I told you guys. I don't know what to say. You'd better figure something out! You know Mulberry had a same-sex homecoming couple last year? I was raised in Mulberry. A gay kid growing up in the south in the 50s and 60s. That was not easy. I had my share of slurs and beatings, but I was one of the lucky ones. My parents always accepted me. And it made things better. Oh things are much better now. We got over Stonewall. We got over the AIDS crisis and the lies they told about us. We can even marry now, which is something I thought I would never see in a lifetime. But I have been living in a dream world. One where, well, everyone is changing and getting over their fear and accepting us as just people. But tonight, Tonight pulled up emotions I had buried for decades. Words that killed me as a kid. Words that will kill every kid in that room. And I'm tired of living the dream world. I'm gonna speak up and I'm gonna fight. And thank you, David, for reminding me. I believe that the way we treat people who we disagree with the most is our true test of our faith. So, I won't hold this against you. I will. Absolutely. You can forget that idea. Me too, really. Get a life. Please. Call from Hot Sweet Muffin. You sure he ain't gay? Call from Hot. Hello? Frank. Okay. I'm coming. I never thought you cared about that thing. I don't care about that thing. I care about what it says. I'm not sure I follow. People like you care about that thing. Care about the answers. You spend your whole life reading it, studying it, down to every last syllable. You obsess with it, but you miss what it's about. There's a lot in here I don't understand, but I do know what it's about. Mystery is God's way of keeping humans humble. Sounds like a complicated way to live. Maybe you've done that to yourself. How much do you know? Enough. Why didn't you stop me? That's not my job. You're a grown-ass man. My job was to love you. And give you a place to stay when you had no place to stay, when nobody wanted you. I really messed up. Really hurt some people. Well, go make it right. I don't even know where to start. Come here. There's this thing the Jews do. I'm not Jewish. But your boy, Jesus was. They don't start their day in the morning the way we do. They start at sundown, before bed, and reflect upon their day. At the end of the day, for the past 60 years, I've asked myself who did I love today? You say you don't know where to start. Start with love. Who did you love today, Dave? Have you seen any of these yet? Read 'em to me. I need to hear your laugh one more time. Thank you for showing me what love is. Hot Sweet Muffin got me huffin' and puffin'. Frank. Thank you for listening when no one else did. Patty, you made me believe in people again. You were the first person I felt actually saw me. You made it okay for me to be weird. You're pretty popular, Patty. Patty? I think we all remember the first time we met Patty. And if you were like me, the first time you met her you were, well you didn't know exactly what to think of her. If there's one thing Patty taught me, it was what living and loving without labels actually looks like. And that reminds me of 1 Corinthians 13 that's sometimes referred to as the love chapter, if I speak in the tongues of mortals and angels but do not have love, I'm a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal. Oh yeah, I've been embracing the colors more lately. The place goes to auction next week. We'll all be there. You guys don't have a prayer. Yeah, it's kind of more of a statement. Why are you here, Nate? I was kind of hoping that you weren't going to be here. Sorry to disappoint. I need to tell you a story. Before I came out to my mom, I had it all perfectly planned out. I rehearsed different responses depending on if she'd hit me or hug me. I mean I really didn't have a reason to be scared, she was always supportive of other gay kids at school, but my friends said that she would be different with her own kid, you know. One day I just, I went off script and I said it. I told her I was gay. So she kicked you out? She hugged me. Told me that she loved me. We both cried. That's my favorite memory with her. So what happened? She got this job in Orlando and things started getting rough at home. So she started going to this counselor on her lunch break to work on her issues, I guess, she said. But she changed. Seemed distant. Questioning if I was really gay or not. Started to sound a lot like you do in class. One day, she came home. I need you to watch this. Honey, come on, let's get this started. Nate, honey, I want to tell you something before I say anything else. I love you. Yeah, yeah, I know. - I - know you've been gay since you been a little boy. Yeah, so you know by this point that it's not a choice. It is a choice. No, it's not a choice. In that case, you have a choice now. You could either get help or move out. I can't support your lifestyle. Mom, it's not a... It's who I am. My baby was not born a queer. I don't know where this is coming from? From the Bible, from God. No, you didn't say this before. You weren't like this, you loved me. You loved me. I still love you. No, no, that's not what... Get back you son-of-a-bitch! What is wrong with you? Stop! There's something wrong with you. There's nothing wrong with me. You're a disgrace. I'm not a disgrace. I can't believe that I have said that my son is a disgrace. Nate. It's not true. I came here to tell you that I forgive you. You're not a disgrace. I forgive you. You're not a disgrace. We're here for the auction. You're early. We wanted to be early. Fill one of these out. - Okay. - Auction starts at three.
