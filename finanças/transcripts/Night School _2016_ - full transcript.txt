[electronic warbling] [funky music] [water trickling] Whoa, what are you doin'? Ooh, that's nasty. [Greg] It's nasty? [laughing] My daughter is somethin' else. She's a mess. [slurping] [Khloe] Stop. I didn't pray. [Greg] Yeah, you did, we did pray. I didn't. [Greg] Yes, you did. No, I didn't. Oh, I'm pretty! [woman speaks indistinctly] She conceited. - Her daddy was conceited at - one point in time in his life. [Khloe] Daddy, I'm pretty. - That was back - when I had all the good looks. [car engines humming] [slow, gentle music] "A" through "J." [speaking indistinctly] - Right here. This line - to have your voucher taken. Mr. Lee told me to grab a code. [photographer] One, two, three. Okay, thanks. [woman] What obstacles and variables did you face getting here? - -[Greg] Getting here? - -Or, like, why-- Like, you know, what kept you from getting your high school diploma? [Greg] Back then, I dropped outta high school just to, uh... just-- just-- just to hang out, sell drugs. I know if I go get a job, you know, my criminal record, you know what I'm sayin'. That's already one strike against me. You know what I mean? You already feelin' like, 'cause I'm-- I'm a black young male, - you feel like that's - the second strike against you, you know what I'm sayin', - then the third strike is - you don't have any education. - -Right. - -You know what I'm sayin'? - So it's - like nine times out of ten, if I apply for a job, it's gonna be a job not payin' nothin'. I don't want a job, I need a career. I'm too old to be just working a job. [Brent] All right, welcome. [woman] Welcome! - [Brent] - How are you guys doin' today? [crowd murmuring] You guys have a special opportunity that across the country people don't have: to return to high school as an adult and pursue your education. So it may have been a job application when you needed certain skills, it may have been about your children, proving to them that you can earn this. The biggest question I'm gonna ask of you is, why are you here? [Khloe and Greg] ♪ Leave me there alone ♪ ♪ To gaze upon your glory ♪ ♪ To sing to you this song ♪ -[clapping] -Good job, baby. That's a little, uh... taste of, uh, my little star. ♪ This girl is on fire ♪ Comin' soon to the world. Y'all gotta watch out for her. ♪ This girl is on fire ♪ [giggling] - When the judge granted me - sole custody, I cried. I remember my cousin sayin', "G-Money, man, what you cryin' for, man?" I said, "Cuz, 'cause what am I gonna do with a whole newborn baby?" you know what I mean? [Khloe laughing] I see you don't wanna hold my hand today. [woman on TV] We'll have more Colts coverage coming up. Mike Berman will have more from the Patriots live from Foxborough. [Greg] Being a single father, I struggle with it on a daily basis. I'm just, like, stressed out with the way my life is being, - but I'm just lookin' at her, - lookin' at her, lookin' at her, lookin' at her. I gotta get my shit together, you know what I mean, but how am I gonna do that? - [teacher] When I say what - genotype you have, I'm talking about what allele did you get from Mom and what allele did you get from dad. In this case... My name is Melissa Lewis, and I'm 53 years old. I've been outta high school for 37 years. [interviewer] Does it feel like 37 years? Yes, it feel like 37 years. [Melissa] I come in here, take my little-- get my little dinner goin'. I was gonna have me some fish and spaghetti. I won't have any more chances to get this high school diploma. I'm gettin' old. If I know what I know back then, I woulda never quit. I didn't get to have a child life. I was a adult very young. I had that first one when I was 14 years old. That's why I dropped outta school. When I go out to go to school, that helps me, you know, to get out this house. Come to class on time Monday and Tuesday. I would go visit him real quick first, and just see if he has a moment today. [Megan] Melissa came in about a year ago. She's taken Algebra five times. I jumped onto them. It was like four of 'em. - It's something that she set - out to do a long time ago, and a chapter she wants to close. I think it's just something she wants to prove to herself. [soft electronic music] [Randall] To my knowledge, we were one of the first schools ever to really offer a high school diploma to adult students versus a GED. [Brent] For so long, when folks only had GED as their option, there was a ceiling. A GED is only slightly better than a dropout in terms of long-term earnings. - [Gloria] Every student comes - in at a different level. - We look at what credits - they still need. Right. [Gloria] In order to graduate, - a student does need - to obtain 40 credits, and they need to pass their ECA. The ECA is an end-of-course assessment that is necessary from the State of Indiana for a student to graduate. [Bryan] This is one of the rougher areas of Indianapolis. The point in coming here is to get your diploma, get a certification to go to work, break that cycle of poverty. It's gonna be a lot harder for them - because they have the - expectation it's gonna be quick and easy here. It's not. And then we have the cholesterol molecules in between here. They look like four fused rings. So here's your phospholipids, and they're forming a bilayer. Then you have your transmembrane protein, so this allows materials into and out of the cell. My name is Shynika Jakes, and I am 26 years old. I've been outta school for seven years. - I wanna be a nurse, - and nobody's gonna accept me - in their program - without a high school diploma. [man] Number six, and can I get a Mountain Dew with it. When I applied for the job, I made sure it fit around my school schedule. Like, I-- That was my main thing. Like, I told 'em I needed to have one set schedule. My boss was like, "Oh, well, your job's not important to you?" - I'm like, "Yeah - my job's important to me, but my school is more important." Maybe I'm pushing myself too hard, but it's just like, Hurry the fuck up, because if you don't, you gonna keep goin' through the same stuff over and over and over again. - [tutor] So you're just gonna - multiply by two, that's five. So now... - [Shynika] - School does give me hope, 'cause I feel like I'm getting somewhere. [bluesy piano music] [students and staff [speaking simultaneously] [teacher] I might include it as part of the story, 'cause it was first... [conversing indistinctly] Soon. I was gonna forget about that one. - [man] - All right, number two says... [tutor] It's subtraction, so you just wanna keep the denominator the same. Here, walk me through. What did you do first? [woman] Okay, I did Y equals negative 2/5X minus six, then you rewrite it, you flip it. You do X equals negative 2/5Y. [Greg] Goin' back to school, been a minute, you know, so that's why I know I'm a little rusty. 7X plus 16. This-- This-- Oh, my God. [students conversing] [Greg] When I was in high school, school was not a priority. There was endless possibilities of how much money that I could make in the streets. [teacher] That would be the Lewis structure for this. The Lewis structure only shows-- [Greg] School was like the long route, and I wanted money now. - [man] He was one of our number - one big cousins, you feel me? - [Rick] Yeah, number one, - you know what I mean, he was number one. Out of cousins, he was the number one. - [Rick] All through school, - he had A's and B's, and he had honor rolls, - and he was goin', - he was goin', he was there. - He quit and only had to get, - how many credits? - [Greg] - I quit my junior year. - My brothers looked up to me, - looked-- - I mean, for real, - you know what I mean? I'm talkin' about, they follow me. - You know what I mean, they - follow me out into the streets. - [Rick] In fourth grade, - my teacher asked me what I wanted to be, and I told her I wanted to be a drug dealer. Literally, told her. I appreciate what Greg doin', - gettin' everything together, - goin' to school, but I have made my success without it. Literally, without it. My daddy didn't think he was gonna do it, either. - He told me, "Greg ain't - goin' through with that." - He said, "He ain't never - went through with nothin'. He always go all the way to the end and quit." [overlapping conversations] There's mud and water down there, boo, you hear me? It's mud and water down there, and you'll sink into it, straight up. Bein' a father is challenging. They need, you know what I'm sayin', daily. [Khloe] Don't push hard. Don't push hard? [Khloe] Wow, this is fast. That's it, that's the best y'all are gonna get. [Judy] She needs to see her daddy more. For real, he's never here. And when he's here, he's sleeping. I think she needs some of his time off. [hip-hop music playing [in background] Nah, I've been goin' to school, niggah, with hangovers, but still I'm in there, on everything, makin' it happen. Shit. Whassup with you, brah? [men laughing and conversing] [teacher] No one has ever heard the word omniscient? [woman] No. [woman 2] To whom is it referred? One of the things we discussed was attendance. You still came in tardy. Why were you late? Uh, yesterday? Yesterday, uh, I really didn't have any excuse. - I mean, - 'cause it was cold outside. - Bottom line, - I know it's real life. I'm Jamaican. I'm Jamaican, I'm the one who should be complaining, so those excuses just won't cut it for me. [Bryan] We are going through the purge process. We're gonna lose another like, probably 30, 40. [woman] Yeah, we are. If we worked our butt off, and we've taken every single measure to make sure that they're successful, if we've done all of that and the productivity still is low, then, okay, so be it, but we've done what we needed to do. [woman 2] I send out the list that we have now, - ask for teachers - to, like, highlight students that they want taken off. [Gloria] We can't want somebody to graduate more than they want to graduate for themselves, so during that purging process - it kind of gets - those individuals who really aren't ready to be here, out. - He was doing word problems - today and that's your biggest problem.... [Randall] They come in with good intentions, but their intentions are just that, they're intentions. There's not full commitment to the action. You know you supposed to be in class. You don't wanna be in class. We help put you back in the class, and we help rearrange the schedule because you work, and you know I've helped you. You know that. - But I'm out here - wastin' my time, so you do what you need to do. You make the choice. You decide to be a man, - because you the one - that has to be the man, not me. I'm already a man. I handle what I need to handle, but I'm tryin' to help you, and you won't let nobody help you - because you keep runnin' - from what you need to know. Stop runnin', man. Stop runnin' away. I'm not, 'cause it's like thug life. All in 100. [soft music] I make sure the clothes are straightened and picked up off the floor, - and that's - what I do basically all day until it's time to clock out. These are cute. Every day I come to work, believe me. I'm lookin' for somethin' for my house or my grandkids. [laughing] It was somethin' to do. Okay, goin' back on in. Growin' up, in school, I was thinkin', like, I felt myself, it's right there in the back of my head all the time. I wonder if I never had my son, if I woulda ever finished school. [Melissa] I'm scared to look at mine. [woman] Can we take our makeup for it today? [Melissa] Aah! - [woman] Can we take a makeup - on the exam? [teacher] Uh, no, I haven't made it up yet. [Melissa] It's gettin' harder. As the time go longer, it's gettin' harder. I'm feelin' it. Algebra, and that's it. That's all I got left to do. That be the only class I have left. [coin clanking] After I get through washing, I know I'm gonna go back to this boring old house, clean it up. [soft piano music] [TV playing] If I could turn back 20 years, I'd graduate from school now, - I'd have me a nice crib, - a nice car, and probably be married and be happy. I can't turn that time back now. I'm sad when I'm alone. I don't have nothin' here with me. I do everything alone, and I hates that, see what I'm sayin'? So, I gotta long way to go before I can get outta that one. [students conversing] [teacher] So I have six X and negative 18 X. If you put a negative five in front of that Y, you tell me, is that right? [students] No. - [teacher] No, it's wrong, - the whole things wrong. Okay. - [Shynika] - I really enjoyed middle school. I had my head on straight, - and I was - an honor roll student. And I went to Arlington High School. Arlington, it was just, like, haywire. Everybody was everywhere. The teachers, they didn't care. I started gettin' into a group of people that I shouldn't have been around. - [teacher] You want - to put your Xs first. Then after that, I just stopped goin'. The last step is to take your X and your Y and puttin' it as a point, as a coordinate. Zero, bring down that six. [Shynika] And that would be... My mind is still at work and not on, oh. - [tutor] Yeah, I understand, - I'm just like that. Okay, so three times, what times three gets you six, right? [Shynika] I am currently homeless. I don't have anywhere to live. A couple of nights, I've been sleepin' in my car. I have friends that let me stay with them, but it's just like, how long is it gonna be before this person puts me out? It probably smells like a lot of bleach in here, like mop water. I've been workin' for this for, like, two years now, - and I still - haven't gotten it together, and I feel like, I'm never gonna get it together. I see the light, like, it's flashin', - and I see the other people - that have made it. I see 'em at the end wavin' at me, like, "Come on." It's just like the tunnel is just gettin' longer. [siren wailing] [somber piano music] - [Greg] They-- They said - he's in critical condition. You know what I mean, that's all I know. - I had just got - off the phone with him, and then James called me, - talkin' about Chuck - just shot Rick. I'm like, "What the fuck?" Yeah. - And you gonna take me - out here, man? 'Cause I don't know if my brother gonna make it or not, man. Damn, man. I just got off the phone with him, just got off the phone with him, just got off the phone. He said he was gonna call me back and see wassup. Phew. Jesus. - In this situation, we're - not allowing any more visitors, - so you guys - are gonna have to-- Oh, my God. Oh, my God! [somber piano music] [music continuing] [yawning] Shit. [man] Up in the top right, you'll go to "log in." There'll be a green hand there. On the left side of the screen, there should be "online testing log on." [Greg] I'm fucked up about my brother bein' shot. I left the streets alone - to walk away - from that type of a life. Every time I think about it, - it's just fuckin' me up - even more, - you know what I'm sayin'? - It's like I calm down, - then I get all, - you know what I'm sayin', all over again, you feel me? I mean, just to think about it like, damn. - Like, if I hadn't enrolled - in school, - I probably woulda been - with Rick, - and Chuck - probably woulda shot me, too. He know how I feel about Rick. He know I'm comin', bottom line. He know that. I don't know, man. It's like, you know what I mean, - I wanna fuck Chuck up right now, - you feel me? [teacher] Still label it like it's supp-- like it actually is. You know it's three. [phone line ringing] Who is this? This Shynika. I know this is Arby's. I'm tryin' to-- Is Tony in? I was seein' if Tony could get somebody to just take half of my shift - for right now until I get done-- - till I get done, Because, like, the test, I can't rush it. I gotta take my time. It's like... Okay, all right. Thank you. Bye. If I had a whole pack of cigarettes right now, I'd probably smoke the whole pack. I just hope I passed. [turn signal clicking] - -[man] Do you work here? - -[Shynika] Yes. - I'm with the, uh... - the Fight for 15 Campaign. Have you heard about it? - -No. - -Okay, cool. What we are is fast food workers that are organizing across the country - for better wages - and working conditions. Okay. And what we do is we go on strike, like, day-long actions, to try to force our employers to pay us better wages. Uh, I really gotta go into work. Okay, okay, that's cool. I've got a little informational pamphlet there for you. Give me a call. Here you are, sir. - Here's your large fries. - Enjoy your evening. -[man] You, too. -Mm-hmm. - [teacher] - If Jack receives his paycheck, at the end of the week, how many bikes did Jack sell? You're always going to start with this equation, and hearing it over and over again every day, you should start thinkin', "Oh, my gosh, I understand." That's pi, period. -That right there is pi. -What you do with it? [Melissa] I talk to Corinne all the time. She keeps me goin', and I keeps her goin'. We both the same age, and we helps each other get through it. I'm startin' to get outta that shell and get out. - [Corinne] That math is - the only thing holdin' me back. [Melissa] Me, too. I'm with you. That math. Whoo, this is so awesome. Look at you, got food goin' down your shirt. I always feed my clothes. [both laughing] Hello? If I got enough time, I'll come over. Elderly lady that lives down the street, and when she gets lonely she'll call me, - and I'll go down there and sit - with her for a couple hours. She needs somebody. She's lonely. - [Corinne] Lonely, lonely, - she's just lonely. [Melissa] I know that's right. [soft music] - [man] - How you doin', ma'am? [Melissa] Ah. Waitin' on the bus? [man] Yeah. - [Melissa] It's about - to come in ten minutes. - [man] - Oh, you kiddin' me? [Melissa] Yeah. [man] You wanna sit down? Go ahead. [Melissa] Okay. [Melissa] You know the bus been runnin' on Saturday today, ain't it? [man] Today's not Saturday. [Melissa] It runnin' on Saturday's schedule. They said that on the news this mornin', all buses are runnin' on Saturday's schedule, for the holiday. Hi. Fine. [laughing] [man speaking indistinctly] -You cold. -You are, too. Right on, nice meetin' you, okay. -What's your name? -Melissa. Melissa? I'm Rick. [Melissa] I'm giving you my number. I'll call you and tell you what's goin' on. [somber piano music] - [Rick] - Greg, I'm talkin' about, boy, ribs and your hip is the worst thing you can ever get broke on your body. Can't breathe. When he shot me, the only thing I was sayin' was, "Lord, I'm-a kill this niggah." The only thing I kept sayin' was, "I'm-a kill this niggah, I'm-a kill this niggah." As I'm turnin' to the side, he hit me right here, so I hurry up and turn like that. As I'm turnin' like that, he hit me again right here. -Boom, so I'm like, "Ahh!" -What the fuck, man?" I mean, that shit be just, man-- Every time I just think about it, man, I just, it's just-- Man, look, this shit is really fuckin' me up, man. Look. Sit down, man. [Rick speaking indistinctly] No, I'm sayin' sit down. I don't want him dead. 'Cause then I'd be just like him. That's what's wrong with the world now. You are your own man, and most people resume they own responsibilities. Do you know what made you a man in the beginning? Did you just say you was a man, or do you know what makes you a man? [child] Daddy! Where you goin'? [soft music] [laughter] [teacher] Find your slope and then your new formula. Remember doin' that? That was a hard problem. 94 plus 89... - [Shynika] I just feel - like my life is overwhelming, because I don't have control. My mind's there, but it's just like my feet aren't takin' me there. - [Bryan] You're working - during school, you know, like, it's killin' you and I can just see it. - [Shynika] If I don't hurry up - and get done, I feel like I'm just gonna be, like, a nobody, just stuck out here. I mean, right now, I'm only workin' minimum wages, and that's not even literally payin' the bills at all. It's, like... It's a lot, it's a lot. [sniffles] And I told myself by the time I was 26, I was gonna have my life together. Here I am 26, still tryin' to get my life together. [soft piano music] - [automated voice] When - you are finished recording, you may hang up or press one for more options. [beeps] Hello, my name is Shynika, and I was callin' you concerning the Fight for 15 to get more information. If you can, give me a call back. I need more information, just to see what all I'm gettin' myself into, that's all. That's all, that's it, that's all. I'm about to go to class. - I'm glad I know you're - my cousin now, boy, that's crazy. - -Now you gotta do right. - -Yeah. You feel me? You gotta do right, man, on everything. So what would your factors be? And the major... - [Greg] Ms. Kerne, - I got a question for you. I just wanna make sure my steps is correct. Oh, right on. Did you do your homework? Yeah. -Did you really? -Yeah. - So now what I need - to do is factor this out? [Ms. Kerne] Mm-hmm. Okay, so I know that's a 1X. So it'd be, uh, 1,000... [Randall] Four weeks ago, you were talkin' about how you really didn't care about what other people thought in some respect. So what-- Why did that change? Every man comes to a point in their life when they have to take a stand by theirself. I got to thinkin' about my daughter, - and thinkin' - about my life and like, "Oh, my God, you know, I have to do this." If I go back, this is what I'm goin' back to. Quittin' is not an option for me. One of my number one priorities right now is gettin' a job. 'Cause my daughter, she's growing out of all of her clothes and shoes and things, and I gotta, I have to make somethin' happen. - [Greg] - Good morning, ma'am. - [woman] Are you - here for an interview? -[Greg] Yes ma'am. -[woman] Okay. [man] At this site, we provide work skills, work opportunities, at that point, training. - [woman] You ran - a background check, correct? [Greg] Yes, ma'am. Okay, so, um, if something was on that background then we would obviously want you - to come forward with us - and talk to us about that. Do you have any concerns there that you would have? - [Greg] - No, I don't have any concerns. Okay. I'm here to be a good asset to the company and show y'all what I'm made of. [conversation inaudible] What up, Kimmy? [Kimmy] Hi, how are ya? I'm doin' good. Hi. Rick? [slow R&B song begins] This is Melissa. Okay, then, that's fine. All right, bye. [laughing] You know what? Ms. D-- Not Ms. Deon, but Ms. Runtey gave me this in class today, and then she gone and put on here Melissa "Date Night" Lewis. ♪ All along I've loved you ♪ ♪ Loved you so ♪ Oh, watch out! ♪ Every day ♪ [laughing] Did you see that shit? That's the worst it's gonna get, ain't it? Dropped the damn ball before it gets to the pins. [laughing] ♪ Whoa yeah ♪ [Melissa] That's embarrassing. You didn't look at the pins. - In other words, - you just threw the ball. [song continuing] [pins clattering] [Greg] The job that I applied for, they told me that they couldn't hire me because of my criminal history. Even though it's been so long ago, - it's still interfering - with what it is that I'm tryin' to do. I was hurt, shitty, and pissed the fuck off, you feel me? Yeah, and then I jumped my little shitty ass on the bus and, you know what I'm sayin', came up back to the crib. - Y'all say y'all want - motherfuckers out the streets. Like, how the fuck am I supposed to get a job? Bottom line, I have to step out on and take the first step. Excuse me, sir, you wouldn't happen to have the number to the people for the expungement thing? -All right. -There you go. They call it Project Grace. It's the Neighborhood Christian Legal Clinic. [Greg] They sayin' here that I need to get a copy of my official criminal history at the City/County Building. Daddy, where are we going? [Greg] We goin' to go, uh, get my records expunged. [squealing] I have to do it, baby, so I can, you know, get a stable and reliable career. This is the police, Dad. Dad, you know this is the police, Dad. The police, you know. Look, be quiet. [bell dinging] Come here, come here. Don't press nothin'. Was that right here at first? Huh? Here's mine. - What am I supposed - to do with it? Get yours, too? You don't have one. [laughing] What you mean? You too-- You too young to have one. Possession of marijuana, operatin' a vehicle without ever receivin' a license. That was 2006. Let me see, the theft, receivin' stolen property. That was 2002. With me, it was just bullshittin' around, you know what I'm sayin'? - Because I-- - As an immature individual, you know what I'm sayin'? - Like, I didn't have - nothin' else better to do. [soft music] - [teacher] When we're - lookin' at third person, we are looking specifically at the thoughts and feelings of characters, or the actions of the characters or their dialogue. This is her ECA prep class. - This is the one that - all the students talk about. [Greg] I got a bottomless pit in my stomach, just a fear. I have to pass this test. [Shynika] ECA is very hard. I was just, like, so ready for it to be over so I can be out there and get a real job and get a real pay. [Melissa] I wanna say that I did somethin' with myself, with my life. I'm almost there. - [Shynika] My boss, like, - literally leaves, like... I don't know if I can say it, but he's not a ass, but he is a ass. [speech drowned out by laughing] When I'm sick he's like, "Oh, we don't care, we need you here." - [woman] - Yep, I hear it every day. So it's like, it's either you're here, or I'm gonna replace you, basically. [man] We're all entitled as working people to a decent job, to a decent life. So the way that we organize the campaign is by doing, like, these day-long work stoppages. We wanna demonstrate, like, our power on the job. We had our banner, our flyers and stuff, -um, and we sat in the middle of the street. -Yeah. You know, we was out there for, what, a hour? We go out there with a message. Just a little bit on the fence, - but not all - the way on the fence. Like, I'm half and half. I'm halfway off, and I'm halfway on. I am worried about getting fired, I am. [man] But, again, use this Friday as practice. Be sure you're taking good notes. I saw you guys highlighting, underlining, and all that, that's great. - [Greg] - So I've been stayin' in school every day until, like, 8:30. Comin' in on Fridays and Saturdays, knockin' it out. So Khloe's gonna let you study tonight? Khloe don't have a choice. Okay, all right. Daddy, can I go on a walk? Daddy-- Khloe, all right, chill out. -Look, look, look. -Okay, look. Girl, come here. Let's go see what they got down here in your size. Daddy, I gotta go pee. Oh, my God. - Okay, can you hold it - for me real quick? - -Come on. - -[Khloe] No. I can't hold it. You can't hold it? [Greg] Khloe, hurry up, baby. Man. Let's go. That one girl said you should... Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, come on, come on, come on, come on, let's go out of here - and do what we came to do and - get on up outta here, all right? [Khloe] That one girl said that I'm pretty. [Greg] Yeah, okay, let me see your hand. - [Khloe] And they like my hair, - and I said, "Thank you." [Greg] Ah, yeah? [Carlton] Mr. Henson? Yes, sir. - [Carlton] - So I know that you're serious about trying to get it together. With that said, I have to tell you -the situation as I see it... -Right. and give you the truth of the matter in terms of the expungement and where you stand. The number one thing that I saw that we're gonna have to-- that you're gonna have to face is that there appears to be a pending charge, basically a warrant, so if you get pulled over, - they have a writ - of attachment basically - where they can take you - and arrest you. Jesus, Jesus, Jesus. Boy, boy, boy. Situation right here has to be resolved, - because basically this counts - as a pending charge so I can't-- I can't file anything-- -[Greg] Do anything until I get this handled. -Until it's concluded. Well, I gotta go down here, turn myself in. Warrant is for drivin' on a suspended license. I got pulled over, and the officer said the probable-- his probable cause for pullin' me over was because the, uh... the license plate cover was too dark. They sellin' these in Auto Zone, you know what I'm sayin'? - But yet, y'all can pull - people over for that, you know what I mean? give people tickets and citations. I mean, you know what I'm sayin'? That's just like, it's a bunch of bullshit, man. [Greg] What's up with you? Well, shit, I'm down here, - but, uh, I went to the court, - and they told me that I gotta go on ahead and turn myself into the jail. - Yeah, I'm about to go ahead - and get it over with. You know what I'm sayin'? - The shit's pending anyway, - you feel me? - That's how I gotta study, too. - I'm visual. Yeah. [Megan] Melissa definitely is frustrated. She just really struggles with memorizing formulas, - and testing seems - to be a big issue for her. She has a lot of testing anxiety. - [teacher] So you want to make - the best possible grade on this test, because you've got to have that average at the end. If you bomb this test, I can almost guarantee you you're not gonna make it to move up. [man in movie] The real Nexar stolen from my servers, stolen from me! What's more? You sold out my code of honor. 3 million euros. - [Melissa] - It's been, like, three years since I had a boyfriend, you know? [laughing] - [Corinne] Baby, - let me tell you somethin'. -I went eight years without one. -Okay. You wasn't missin' too much. [laughing] - -We in love. He in love - -He in love? [laughing] You in love? - -A little bit. - -A little bit? - -Okay. - -Just a little bit. - There ain't nothin' wrong - with it. I'm keepin' it hid, though. Rick, I'm-a leave two of these cigarettes for you. [pan sizzling] - [Melissa] - All right, I'm outta here. [Rick] I'll miss ya somethin'. -Okay. -Mwah. -Bye, baby. -[laughing] Here, wanna kiss? I wouldn't give ya none last night. There you go. [laughing] - [whispering] - Guess what you got on your quiz? -What? -You made a 88. Hallelujah, hallelujah! Thank you, Jesus! Thank you, Jesus! I did it girl. I know you could. I knew you could. She made an 88. Very proud of her. And I think that's what she needs is that metal boost when she takes her exam to know that she can do it. - To go down on the point, - I'm not gonna go across, -I'm gonna go down. -You goin' down. [teacher] I wanna see how she does on her final on Monday. She's gotta make a 70. I can't move her on without a 70 in the grade book. [soft music] [deputy] Well, there ya go, all right? All right. - Take care of yourself, - stay out of trouble. [phone dialing] [line ringing] [Carlton] Thank you for contacting - the Neighborhood - Christian Legal Clinic. - I'll do my best - to return your call -as soon as I can. -[beeps] Hey, what's goin' on, Carlton? This is Gregory Henson. Um, I've got that matter resolved, so I no longer have the warrant, and they've issued out me a new court date. Have a blessed day. [Khloe] ♪ You can't do it What I can do ♪ [Greg] She need to be in a musical or somethin'. Straight up, that's all she does, run around... [humming, [imitating Khloe singing] [laughing] - -I missed you. - -[Khloe] Daddy. I can't have no hug? [conversing indistinctly] - [teacher] - Just like here, you wanted to isolate your variable. [female student] How? - [Brent] I mean, I told him - to just come up there. - [female student] - Good, do it that way. I like that, thank you. There you go. - I need another parentheses right - there, but that is correct. [Shynika] I'm on my way to Chicago to the Fight for 15 meeting. - They're currently - trying to get me to go on strike with them. I'm really trying to, you know, get the feel of it first. I don't know what to expect, so it's kinda like, open freely. - Whatever happens, just happens, - right now at this point. [conversing indistinctly] Okay, good afternoon, everybody, good afternoon. We got somethin' big on the agenda today. Fast food workers from all across the nation will be having our largest strike ever. They gonna give us what we want. - We ain't-- - We ain't beggin' for this here. We takin' what we deserve. [woman] That's right. I'd like to kinda open the floor up for right now and see why some of you guys are goin' on strike. - Be supportive for my son, - so he won't have - to, you know, struggle - like I'm strugglin' now to take care of him and pay my bills. - [man 2] I see people that's been - workin' there for ten years, 12 years, you know, they don't get no paid weekend off, you know, they don't get no help on their medical. [man 3] I've been livin' in poverty since basically two, and to see us struggling in this world that is corrupted by power, fame, and money, and no one givin' us nothing, we have to keep fighting, because if we keep fighting, we will get our voices heard and we will be somebody. Thank you. [applause] It is a crime to live in this rich nation and to receive starvation wages. You can put some golden arches on top of it, but it's still a plantation, ain't it? When the vote is called, if you agree to come out and strike, you hold that card up high as you can get it. Should we keep that pressure on? [woman] Yes! Should we keep on bangin' 'em till they give in? Those of you that wanna go out on strike with us on December 4th, I want you to hold that card up as high as you can. Yeah, yeah! So I think this thing unanimous. -Yeah. -[applause] [Shynika] I'm gonna fight. It's somethin' I'm proud to be a part of. I probably won't get nervous until we go to strike. I have never did anything like this before, so it's like you never know what it's gonna be. Man, this shit's deep. [Melissa] Look what our test is gonna be on tomorrow. This is what I gotta get on. Just go through this and just look at some of this shit. I'm scared. You ain't got to be scared. You can do it. You been doin' it. I took Algebra One in school, - and it was enough - for me to graduate. Took basic math-- - [Melissa] So you know - a little bit of this, then. Yeah, I do. [Melissa] Tell me how you do-- - But this is new, - this is new, somethin'. - [Melissa] - Now all of a sudden, it's new. No, some of this is new. [Melissa] I'm stuck like fuck, too, but I gotta do it if I wanna pass out this class. [upbeat music] [indistinct conversations] - [teacher] Which one - has a longer wavelength? [Greg] Red light. - Red light would have - a longer wavelength, 'cause it's closer to this side. - -Ohh! - -So-- From vi-- From visible light-- [teacher] From gamma rays all the way over to that side. Okay. - [Greg] - Bottom line, my attendance and my grades this term. Okay. - -Yes. - -You feel me? We'll see. You have English 5, and you have Geometry, - which means you - have to have the English 5 in order to take the ECA. I'm-a get through here. You feel me? Yeah. Do I feel-- What does that mean exactly? [Greg] Look, do you understand what I'm sayin'? - -Ya dig? - -I think so. [Melissa] Today I get my schedule, and I'm-a find out if I'm gonna pass Algebra 1A or not. So did you pass, you passed your Algebra? Yep, mm-hmm. Yes! Freedom! [indistinct conversations] [man] Girl, you got a lotta classes. - You got Biology - third and fourth period, and then you got Algebra 1 first and second period. I'm tryin' to get the hell outta this damn shit, and they keep on puttin' me back in the same shit. [somber music] - [Megan] - I know that you're frustrated, but I also don't wanna see you let that frustration get in the way of you finishing, - because you're - very close to the end. We talked about this. [Melissa] I just got so much goin' on, you know. My mind just seems like it's just... [speaking indistinctly] I'm tryin' my best to hold in there. I am. - I'm sorry - y'all have to see this, but sometimes I have to let it out. And I feel like I'm not gettin' anywhere, after all this I'm goin' through. It do, I feel it's that way. - [Greg] So I gotta put it - into scientific form. - [Judy] - Let me know what they say. -[woman] I am. -[Greg mumbling] This is ECA practice, the shit that's gonna be on the ECA. These are called quadratics. - [Judy] - Okay, but how do you do it? Okay, look, let me show you. Okay, 5N minus 8 equals zero, and then 3N minus one equals zero, all right? - So you already - got your answer. Hold on, no, you don't. - But you do got the answer, - you just said- No, you do not. That's not the answer. Get away from me. - -Get away. Khloe, stop. - -[laughing] Stop, Khloe. [soft music] [Greg] All I know is I was asleep, and all of a sudden, I hear my auntie yellin', "Gregory, get up, she havin' a seizure!" My baby was twitchin' and just starin' off into space. I felt helpless. [rain falling] I mean, I felt like I was about to lose her, you feel me? I mean, I felt like, just like... like... like I-- like I-- like I was just sorry. [rain falling] I got ya, baby. Like, baby, I'm so sorry. Like, I wish I could just relive each and every moment of your life all over again, like, never takin' nothin' for granted. [knocking] We've been goin' through a lot, and I know that sometimes I'm might push her off. Shh. Right now it's 3:28 a.m. Gotta be at school at nine o'clock. I gotta final in first period. - I'm waitin' to see - what the doctors have to say about everything. Hopefully it's something that's curable, that it's somethin' that she don't have to live with for the rest of her life. [somber music] Daddy, you can sit. You can sit right here. I'm cool, boo, I'm-- I'm-a stay right here. I'm-a stay put. No, just sit right here. I need you to not talk crazy. I need you to not say, "Daddy, don't bring me here no more," - -and just be cool. - -Don't bring me here no more. - [Greg] I need you - to just be cool, all right? - -Can you do that? - -Don't bring me here no more, because I don't-- I don't have to stay here too long. - [Greg] You don't - like stayin' here too long? No. - -Big, big ahh. - -Ahh. Good job. Okay, touch my light with your finger, mm-hmm. Touch my light with your other finger. - So what do you-- - I mean, so what, she's a epilip-- lepic-- leptic? -[doctor] She has epilepsy. -Epilepsy, okay. - [doctor] - Okay, give me a deep breath. [doctor breathes deeply] Good job, do it again. - So week one, she doesn't - get anything in the morning, but she's gonna get 2.5 mls at night. That's a half a teaspoon. [Greg] Okay. - [doctor] Week two, - she gets a half a teaspoon - in the morning, - half a teaspoon at night. [teacher] We are doing, if you can be here tomorrow first period guys, we are doing the last talk of inequalities. I have one new type of problem to teach you, and it's on the test, so I wanna make sure y'all know how important it is. - [Shynika] My boss has dropped - my hours down to 11 hours, so I only work two days a week. He scheduled me when he know I'm supposed to be at school. Like, I don't know if he's pushin' me to try to quit, but it's just like, it's gettin' hard. Are we combining like terms? [woman] I think you do. [Bryan] Her attendance has kinda been hit and miss. Right now, she has the slightest hope of graduating in May. It's not gonna happen probably, - just 'cause - of the way the ECA tests are gonna be rolled out. [Shynika] My head is, like, really cloudy right now, 'cause I still got this test on my mind. So I can't be frustrated with me thinkin' about I gotta be to work, and then I'm still tryin' to, you know, stay focused for this test. Like, this is a-- This-- This is a big test. This is not nothin' that you play with. I wanna hurry up and graduate from school, so I can start my nursing career, instead of havin' to run out for every day to a 7.25 job. [radio playing in restaurant] - [Greg] - I'm startin' to see the light at the end of the tunnel, and now all this stuff just jumpin' out. It's just like, Oh, my God, for real? You know what I mean? Come on, man. Do you find out if you're going to get arrested or not at this hearing, or what is to come of this hearing that you're going to? Nah, just to see how the judge feel about everything. This'll be my first time standin' before the judge. - [Gloria] - So there is a possibility that you could get arrested? Yes, truthfully, yeah. [somber music] - [judge] The maximum penalty - on an "A" misdemeanor is 365 days in the Hendricks County Jail and a $5,000 fine. What the law tells me is that I have two choices. So I can either accept this plea deal that you've given me here, or I can reject it. [Greg] For this to be completely over, I have to pay a total of 218 dollars and 50 cent. I don't have to come back down here ever again. It's over. I really need to count this as a blessing. Gettin' this ticket paid off is the last thing that I have to do in order to go through with the expungement. ♪ Throw your hands in the air Say you [indistinct] ♪ [laughing] [Megan] Melissa hasn't been here since last Tuesday. Normally my students are really good about - letting me know if - they're not gonna be here, and normally she has been, too, so I'm, you know, quite concerned. [soft music] [Melissa] This is my mama's plot here. - She always wanted me to go - back to school. She talked to me about that all the time. Yeah. I didn't never know deep down in my heart that it was gonna be this much of a struggle. I 'posed to been outta school. I kinda wonder sometime was it the right thing to do, 'cause I'm the only one felt myself. [birds chirping] - [man] These are the folks - that we're gonna target with our demonstration. The corporate businesses that we're gonna hit, their lobbyists, the people that they pay to pass laws, and then we're gonna hit the lawmakers, the people who pass the laws themselves. - [man, chanting] None - of these workers can survive! [strikers] Thank you, 7.25! None of these workers can survive! -Thank you, 7.25! -None of these workers... [Shynika] First spot that we started out at, I was a little nervous and, like, quiet. - I gotta open my mouth, 'cause - if I don't open my mouth, who's gonna open it for me? [strikers] Get up, get down! - [man] This is - what democracy looks like! [strikers] This is what democracy looks like! Hold the burgers, hold the fries. Make my wages supersize. - -What do we want? - -[strikers] 15! -When do we want it? -Now! -What do we want? -15! -When do we want it? -Now! I'm strugglin' on 7.25 an hour, and I believe that if we fight long enough and we keep fighting, that we should push and get to where we need. We don't want minimum wages. We want living wages, so we're gonna keep fighting. [inspirational piano music] [woman shouting on bullhorn] - [Shynika] - I think it's very important that, like, I get the word out to other people. There's other people out here that's goin' through the same stuff, and that won't step ahead and that won't say nothin', but if I get ahold to them and be like, "You know, you should join with us." The more people that we have is what's gonna get us the change. [cheering] [woman] Whose house? Our house! [indistinct conversations] [laughing] You wanna see where you're at right now, grade wise? [Greg] Yeah. Okay. Right above my finger. Okay, that's what's up. -Mm-hmm, good job. -That's what's up. -Um... -That's what's up. I mean, just to think, four months ago, I didn't know a lick about it, you know what I mean? I'm talkin' about, boy, it was like, whoo. 4A plus 6B minus 2C, hold on. [mumbling] [teacher laughing] For real, I was like, man. I knew that day I had to stop smokin' marijuana. [laughing] - [Greg] - I'm here to see Carlton. [receptionist] And, uh, what's your name? Gregory Henson. - What they ended up doin' - was just givin' me court fees and costs. - Well, is it still - gonna be a misdemeanor, or will they drop it if you pay? - [Greg] Yeah, it's - gonna be a misdemeanor. - Okay. - You know, the unfortunate news is, since you were convicted, that does start the time clock back. 'Cause if you were to try to do it early right now, the prosecutor's just gonna look and see, - okay, well you were just - convicted two months ago... [Greg] Mm-hmm. - but we're not gonna grant - an expungement for you in this case or scenario. So, where it leaves you right now in terms of expungement is at least 2018, 2019 before that's a realistic possibility to do that. The fact that you're here shows that you're tryin' to make those steps to-- [Greg] I am. [Carlton] To clean that up. - [Greg] I understand - what you're sayin', man. It just, you know, it just hurts. [Carlton] In the long run, you know, you're 30, think about 35, think about 40. Stick with it. [Greg] I will, I have to. My daughter's well-being and everything is dependent on it. [somber music] I got this letter from Megan, and it's so touching that she even took the time out to write this letter for me. "I consider it an honor to know you. I do not want to see you give up because you have to repeat a class. I hope you know that you are appreciated and respected by many. I would love to see you continue your path to a diploma. You are close to the end. Respectfully, Megan." [woman speaking from pulpit [indistinctly] [organ playing softly] [pastor] All of us who are here at some point in life, will have to deal with the darkness of the night. Look, you don't have to run from darkness. The Savior surrendered, and He suffered, and He went through it. Faith that is born in the light is generally developed in the dark. [applause] [Melissa] When my pastor said what he said today, I learned not to keep on beatin' myself up, because long as I keep doin' that to myself then I'm gonna always be that type of person. So I learned not to keep on beatin' myself up and move on. [soft music] - [Shynika] I was one of - the people that stood out there in the cold, hands freezing, screaming at the top of my lungs. For real. For real. And they got it to 10.10. [Greg] At the end of the day, her well-being - is not the next person's - responsibility. It is nobody' else's, it's mine. If I'm not prioritizin' correctly, that's like sayin', "Forget her," and if I'm sayin', "Forget her," then what kinda man am I? [music continuing] [exhales] Good mornin'. [speaks indistinctly] I'm kinda nervous. I wanna pass, so I can get outta here. [proctor] You have 55 minutes for this session. I need all phones off and put away. First session is with a calculator, all right? - Everybody have scratch paper, - calculator, record sheet, and pencils. Everybody got those? Just relax. [proctor] About to start in five, four, three, two, one. [music] [Shynika] If I don't pass it, - then I don't know - what the next step is. So... I don't know. - My heart's beatin' really hard, - really fast right now. Like, I'm nervous, and I'm done takin' the test. Like, I just want the scores to hurry up and come so I can see if I passed or not. [sighs] It's so strange to have a high school that serves adults that it's not commonplace yet. This is larger than just a piece of paper that says "high school diploma." This is a social justice issue. My job is similar to a guidance counselor in that-- - [Brent] Because of the zip code - they've grown up in, they haven't had a fair shake at education. Up here, he's always a popular one. - [Brent] - The individuals that are here are capable of all the same things as somebody who grew up in the affluent suburbs, but in a lot of ways, they just didn't receive the same advantages that those folks might have. - [teacher] The answer - is positive or negative? - -[class] Negative. - -[teacher] Negative, now... [Randall] If you're graduating from here, you're changing not only your life, but you're changing lives generationally. It brings meaning and value to what education is and where it can get you. I wasn't supposed to be here 'cause I don't feel good today, and Mr. Bryan called me today like, "Are you gonna come get your ECA scores? Just come to school tomorrow." And then I'm like, "Fuck it, I'm just gonna come today." Well, how do you think you did for the ECA? I mean, I believed in myself, and I thought I passed. [Bryan] Yeah. Oh, my God. [Bryan] It's a really difficult test. - There wasn't a whole lotta - students who passed this time. On this, it says you got a 399. Are you serious? [Bryan] Yep. Oh, God, thank you. So I did pass, right? [Bryan] You passed. I more than passed it, right? - [Bryan] You actually - did really well. Oh, my God. Give me a hug. - Yeah, you did-- - This was all you. -Oh, my God. -You did the work, so. Yes, thank you. I passed with 399. [laughing] -[Gloria] How's it goin'? -[Greg] All right. I decided that, uh, we'll go ahead and talk about your results. So, how do you think you did? Okay, well, on the first part, uh... I didn't utilize my time wisely. Before I know it, I was like, oh, my God. The time was up, and I had, like, 12 left to do. From what I can see here, you passed. Oh, my God! Oh, my-- Aah! [Gloria] Yeah, you really did pass. Jesus Christ. So that's pretty amazing, yeah. [laughing] Oh, my God. -Yeah. -Oh, my God. So you should be very proud. I am telling you, I done been through hell and high water to get here, for real. Bottom line. [Gloria] Yep, yep, yep. Straight up. Oh, my God. [indistinct conversations] [music] [man, on P.A.] Please stand as the class of 2015 enters their graduation ceremony. [cheering and applause] It's a big day, man. [child] Mama, Mama! [speaker] You're no longer this thing called a dropout. You're a graduate, with all the honors and all the privilege that comes with that. Their life is forever changed. I know that's right. [applause] - [speaker 2] The next speaker - I would like to introduce is Mr. Greg Henson. - As a single parent - of a four-year-old daughter who suffers from epilepsy, he often found himself wanting to give up. However, he continued to excel. [applause] -[man] All right, Greg! -[child] Go, Greg, go! Go! If you want somethin' in your life you never had, you have to do somethin' you never done, and things change when you deal with it. I found myself as a 31-year-old single parent, who was tired of hardships and struggles in my life. I knew that the only way to legitimately overcome this, I had to create a solid foundation through education. To my daughter, baby, I love you, and always remember you can and you will. We have the ability to build and uplift one another. All it takes for us to do this is to take charge, make better with our lives, and decide to be a part of the change that we all wish to see in the world. - It is an honor to present - to you the Excel Center Class of 2015.
