Zuranda under spell now, she ready. You've done your work well. Now it's my turn. Your magic and mine. No! Gods like my magic, maybe not like yours. Oh, you startled me. I wish you'd wear shoes. No, shoes and Bobo big enemies. No like. What do you want? Bobo come say maybe Madam Mrs. Lady want cup tea. No, thank you. What are they doing out there? Not know. You like me, Bobo, don't you? Oh, very fine lady. Then help me get away from here, please! Get me as far Bandalaya and I'll give you this. You speak run away, doctor kill me. This, too. It's yours if you help me escape. Gandor outside. He watch house every minute. No speak run away. Bobo not listen. This very sad house for you. If I stay here, he'll kill me. You can help me if you want to. I know how I help. I bring you cup nice hot tea. She must be powerful of mind and body, this new woman. The blood of the fox to make her cunning. The claw of the cougar to make her strong. She will have the strength of 10 tigers and she'll kill, Chaka. She'll have to kill to survive. The venom of the viper to make her kill. It's reacting. Now she's ready. Not yet! The blood ritual. After that, we must wait. Where's he taking ya? Up north, that's all he'd say. Last night after he go to his room, I find this. What do these things mean? These are the objects used by the natives in the ceremony of the voodoo. This isn't gonna help us. Make him tell ya. He's tough, Marilyn, he's tough and he's smart. It isn't that he's so smart. It's just that you're stupid. How'd I ever get mixed up with a guy like you anyway? I think I had some dough at the time. Come on, Mom'll show you how it's done. Well, what is it this time, Marilyn? You look lonely, Harry. And you think you can cure it? I've been known to. Some cures are worse than diseases. You hate my guts and I hate yours. That's true, but that doesn't mean we can't do business. Get to the point. You're spoiling my drink. Go on, Ox. About this trip, when do we get going? You know our guide is supposed to be on the Jawar bus tomorrow. We leave the next day. That's wild country you're going into. What are you looking for? That's my business. I thought this deal was between us. What's her stake in this? She... I figure to marry Rick when he gets back. I wanna make sure he does. You know the way women are. You going to marry her? One week with you and you'll join her boyfriend back in the States, the one she... I'd kill you, too. But there's still a drink left in here. Cut it out. I've got a right to know what I'm going after. Wealth, lots of it, if we get back alive. What kind of wealth? Gold? Money? Diamonds? We're going into the jungle to bring back a secret recipe for borscht. There's millions in it! This fiancee of yours, don't turn your back on her. You'd better not either. I don't intend to. No luck, eh, cherie? Give me another. Alas, ma petite, I shall be forced to cancel the credit which I have so generously extended, but I am helpless. Whiskey does not grow on trees. Yours does. This stuff tastes like it comes from a gum tree. Tastes like turpentine. I'll outfox him. Go to his room. Wait for me. Go on! You are very angry, cherie. Hand me my bag. You think he's carrying a gun? You know I do not permit my customers to carry a gun. I'm going to his room and I don't want him to see me. Yvette. Yvette. More of them drawings. Keep looking. Where did Marilyn go? You have made Marilyn very angry, Monsieur. I tell you this for your own protection. Thanks for the warning. If there were police in this place, you would seek their help. I've got a gun in my room. That's enough protection for me. It's a long way to your room, Monsieur. For $5 American. Did Monsieur think I would give him an empty gun? Just a little. Alas that I am so misunderstood. Yvette, my favorite song. Rick! Hold it in the light. This stuff's gold. I wonder what they use for the eyes. Diamonds and rubies. I'm rich! I'm rich! Not quite. Turn around and put your hands flat against the wall. Put that down! I'm not kidding. I know you're not. Marcel is a friend of mine. She's cute, huh? You'll never be able to find where that came from without me, Marilyn. I'm the only one who knows. I'll make a deal. I can't deal with you, Harry. You know that. We'll find out where they are, won't we, Rick? Let's get out of here. What for? There's no cops here. Marcel will cover for us. Keep searching. How come you didn't tell me about that rigged gun? A girl just naturally keeps from telling everything she knows. Keep looking. We're doing it, Chaka, white man's science and the black voodoo. You know what they said about me in the States? That I was a man of science trying to outrage the laws of nature. But my forms couldn't change. We're proving them wrong. Magnificent. She like this while spell last. Then she change back. But she must stay like this. I'll find a way. I'll take her back home to my own laboratory. No, no take home. Zuranda, daughter of priest, next village. But we can't stop now. We're brothers of the blood, Chaka. I'll make a goddess of her, mighty and indestructible. Not my kind goddess. I'll take her away from here, back to my own people. I not know. Chaka. You can tell your people it was your magic. They'll make you a god, a god for all time. They'll make sacrifices in your image. Look. You take her. It is Marcel. Ah, poor Monsieur Harry, a sad funeral. No one to mourn him. Only my tears to water his grave. May he rest in peace. It was very costly, too. You owe me much money. I don't doubt that, the way you keep books. There were many things to attend to, witnesses to swear he died of a heart ailment. No one ever knows when the gendarme will start coming to this forsaken place and start asking questions. I hope all this unpleasantness was worthwhile. Not exactly, but we've got a starting point. These things make sense to you? The black voodoo. This beautiful sound you hear is gold, Marcel. Beyond Bandalaya, the voodoo country. Those dolls are up in there somewhere. And all we've gotta do is find that somewhere. It would be suicide to attempt it. I would throw myself on this. You just finished telling us how much we owe you. If you wanna get it back, why don't you help us? I have warned you that is all I can do. If you are successful in your attempt, I will expect a respectable rate of interest. That's our Marcel, back to normal again. Rick tells me that Harry didn't know the guide who's coming today. That's right. He hired him by mail, he told me that. Marcel, meet the new Harry West. A rare pleasure, Monsieur Harry. Likewise, Monsieur. I will offer one suggestion, gratis. Yeah, I'll bet. Every voodoo tribe have their own symbol, their own signs. Then we've gotta find the tribe with the right markings and we're where we wanna be. Precisely. Marcel, you're a genius. Well. That is very possible. Aha, a new face, and a handsome one. My girls will be pleased. You can tell them I'm not buying tonight. Looking for a Harry West. Oh, you must be the guide Monsieur West hired. Marilyn! This is Monsieur West's guide, Mademoiselle Marilyn Blanchard. American, huh? You know the Bandalaya country? Been outta the States long? Your tongue glued in your mouth? I figured my boss was Mr. Harry West. No use answering the same questions twice. I got news for ya. I'm his boss. So if you answer my questions, you're in the clear. Name is Ted Bronson, 6'1", 180 pounds, sleep light and eat heavy. When I'm broke, which is most of the time, I hire out as a guide. Anything else? You'll pass. I'm sure we'll make the most of our little trip, you and I. You going along? It's pretty rough country for a woman. I'll survive. When do we leave? Tomorrow. Good, gonna go turn in. Oh, I forgot to tell you. I never mix pleasure with business. Sometimes they're one in the same. I'm sure we'll get along just fine. Cherie, I think in that one, you meet your match. We'll see. From this point on, we'll be in voodoo country. They won't like our being there, but if we leave them alone, they won't bother us. Maybe. We'll turn back at Bandalaya. Beyond that point, they'll do more than just resent us. Like what? Like a poison dart in the back of the neck. Pleasant little things like that. Sounds real cozy. For a Russian ruble, I'd check out of this treasure hunt. Treasure hunt? He's, uh, kidding. Look, I'm warning you, you make one hostile move or show too much curiosity about their customs and rituals and they'll kill ya. There's more than one white man's skull hanging from their totem poles. We'll be good, won't we, Harry? Oh, the very best. Now let's start this little walk. Voodoo drums. We'll be hearing them from now on and there'll be somebody watching us all the time. So don't leave camp by yourself and don't reach for your guns unless you know what you're shooting at. From here on, we're very unwelcome visitors. You make too much of this voodoo stuff. They know enough to respect this. Now listen, you. Hey, cut it out, you two! I know what's eating him. He's jealous. All right, we'll make camp here. What are they doing down there? Not know. No go. He kill you. Me too. Oh, God! This time, its effect will be permanent. Go to your room, Susan. I'll be back in a few minutes, Chaka. I told you never to go near my laboratory. I heard her cry out. You were interfering with my work, Susan. Nobody's gonna stand in my way, not even you. If we had it to do over again, we'd know better, wouldn't we, Susan? You wouldn't have married a man of my age and I wouldn't have undertaken to play nursemaid to a whimpering, shallow woman who's been crying homesick for the past seven years. What were you doing with that poor girl? You'll know very soon. I've a right to know now. Very well. I'm using her to create a new being. A being? Not man, not beast, but a combination of the best of each. When I'm finished, we'll take her back to the States with us. We'll shatter the very foundations of science. You're insane. Never say that! Never say that to me again! Oh, Roland, let me go home myself, please. No, we're going back together in triumph. I can't stand it any longer. Please, Roland. Please. It's too late now. If you try to escape, I'll kill you. You are ready. From this time on, I will send my thoughts to you and you will obey. Even though I do not speak, you will hear my voice. Rise, Zuranda. Come with me. Stop. Go to the village. The hut, destroy it. After them! You didn't obey me. You must kill or you will not survive. Do as I say. Destroy the house. You asleep, Ted? Tell me something about this voodoo routine. Well, it's as old as human life itself. Based on superstitions, hysteria, hypnosis, and native medicines. You know, I've seen healthy men shrivel up and die because some priest cursed a rag image of them. And I've heard of men going out of their mind because somebody drew a certain symbol in the dirt at their feet. I like the sound of those drums. It's like they were talking to me. I wanna go past Bandalaya, to the north country. If you do, it'll be without me. I'll change your mind. Wait and see. I'll wait. My people angry. They say you try make Zuranda kill own people in next village. They want girl back. That not all. White man come this way. Evil sign. Tell them I'll use Zuranda to get rid of the white people. Tell them I'll have her kill the white men if they don't go back. No, no, Zuranda no kill. She good. She no do nothing under spell she not do when awake. You tell her kill, you break spell. I'll teach her to kill. No teach this. Must be born to kill. Bring girl back. Soon it will be the night of the blood sacrifice. Third night moon fill sky. I'll bring her back then. No harm my people. I swear it. I swear it in blood. What's the matter? Put that down. Knock one of them watchdogs off and they'll leave us alone. From now on, I'd better hang onto these. If you'd have killed that native, we'd be feeding vultures in an hour. He won't give you any more trouble, Ted. All you gotta do is lick him once. All right, we'll be in Bandalaya in the morning. We get supplies and turn back. Right back to Marcel's place, empty-handed? Oh, he'll love that. He'd be so tickled, he'd slit our throats. What did you expect to come back with? Butterflies to add to his collection. I don't know about you two, but when we get to Bandalaya, I turn back. Now let's go. You've hardly eaten anything. I'm not hungry. I wanted to go for a walk today. Gandor wouldn't let me. He's just following my instructions. I'm a prisoner in my own home. You might say that. Bobo, you've been very careless about Mrs. Gerard. She found her way down to my laboratory yesterday. I, I go to kitchen. I come back, she gone. Very careless, Bobo. I've spoken to Chaka about... Chaka! Please, Mr. Doctor, tell him I do anything you say. The matter's out of my hands. I have a surprise for you. I'm ready to show you what I've accomplished. Come along, my dear. I... I don't think I care to see. You said you wanted to know. Now I insist. Come along. No! No! No! She's dead. No, she's between life and death. She's in a state which I call pre-transformation. Talk to her, Susan. Zuranda. I only have to think a command and she'll obey. Get up. Go to the end of the room and come back. Tell her to lie down on the table. Lie down. Lie down on the table. I've seen enough. No! No, not nearly enough. Science has many disguises. You'd be surprised how much knowledge of medicine and chemistry I've gathered here. Take the curichi root, for example. It has the most amazing effect on a woman's skin. Used to take hours to achieve results. Now it's only a matter of seconds. Not a mark. I've thrown a spear at this leg, not a scratch. Look at this. This acid could eat its way through iron. The indestructible being, immune to the folly of man and the death cycle of nature. What are you trying to prove? Prove? Only that there are no secrets that genius cannot fathom. And this deathless being of yours, what are you going to do with her? Lead her through the halls of the colleges that mocked my theories. And after that? She may mother a whole race of new beings. Oh! You are crazy! You gonna babysit all night with those guns? Looks like it. What's the matter? You act like I was sprayed with poison. You are. You didn't think so last night. Temporary insanity. I knew you were poison the minute I laid eyes on you. Then why'd you take the job? I needed money. I'm a sucker for eating regular. What are you after, Marilyn? What's this all about? Eh, voodoo stuff, huh? What about it? Suppose I was to tell you that one of the tribes around here uses gold to make the stuff. Could be. But you'd have to be out of your mind if you think you could get your hands on it. Then I'm out of my mind because I'm gonna get it. They'd tear you apart limb from limb. I need your help. I'll split 50-50 with you. What about your friend over there? The jungle swallows a dozen of 'em every day. Nice, clean-cut, all-American girl, huh? Right outta the slums of Pittsburgh, and this is my chance to stay out. I want that gold so bad I can see it every time I close my eyes. You know your way around. You can talk their language. I'm still not buying. I'll take you as far as Bandalaya, then you're on your own. Oh, and leave me the address of your next of kin. I'll write them a nice, long letter. Tell 'em how you died in the jungle, 'cause you won't be coming back. I'll take that gamble. I'm coming back with it or not at all. You're coming with me. I need your help. I can kill. I've done it before. Get yourself some sleep. I'll sit up with this armory. Go on! It's either me with the guns or Harry. And you know how he feels about you. Better give it some thought before morning. Might save your life. Who is it? Me, Bobo. Open door. No one here. Some of your people come this way. White people? How far away? Near Bandalaya. Bobo! Not you. They catch you. I try. This place bad. You write letter. I take white man's camp. Maybe I lucky. This make you feel better. Better I now go. Be very careful, Bobo. Bobo no careful. He die. Maybe some tomorrow you be happy. Me too. Maybe. That's what you gotta look for, those markings. You'll find them on their totem poles and on the walls of their huts, if you find them. What about that watchdog out there? I'll draw him off. Ah, ah, ah! I've been looking for an excuse. You just won't be friendly, will you? Come on. Look what you're making me do. All right, lie down. That'll keep him curious. Go on out that way. There could be somebody out there, too. If Harry doesn't come back, we'll know there is. First time I ever had to tie a man to keep him down. Those drums are talking to me. They're saying you're rich, Marilyn, you're rich. Listen, he'll hear 'em, too. Faster, we must move faster. It isn't too late to sign up, Ted. Pay's real good with bonuses thrown in. You're still fighting me! This'll be something to tell your grandchildren, how you protected your virtue against overwhelming odds. You gonna help me? Well, untie me and I might help you stay alive, if it's not too late. I'm tired. I'm gonna go to bed. See you in the morning. I'm a light sleeper and I like you, but... Yeah? There. These are enemies of your people. They've come to kill. You must kill them. Your father's gods demand their lives. You must kill. Kill! Chaka was right, I can't make you kill. You're no use to me. Go back to your village. You lost, baby? Don't be scared. I'll see that you get home. What'd you learn? This, right in our own backyard. The same outfit that's been tailing us. We got this far. What now? We'll talk about it in the morning. You're cut up pretty bad. I just tangled with some bushes, that's, that's all. White man die for this. That's only right. All white man die, you too. If they kill me, much evil will come to them. They say you evil. My magic will curse them forever. Whoa. It is bad to kill at the time of the sacrifice. The white people will themselves kill the guilty man. Tell them that. Must do right away. One of you killed a native girl last night. You must be punished at once, otherwise you will all die. It was him. Now wait a minute, if I remember correctly, I was tied all night. Looks rough. Marilyn, you ain't gonna let 'em kill me. You can talk them out of it. Square it somehow. What can we do? Take him. They want one of you to kill him. Marilyn, wait a minute. It's either him or us. Now, Marilyn, listen. Marilyn, you can't! You weren't kidding when you said you could kill. You live around here, near these people? With them. Can you fix it up for us to hang around a little while, kinda rest up a little bit before we start back? I don't know. I think so. This is the outfit that owns the gold. You can stay with me for a few days. If you don't mind, I think I'll head for Bandalaya. Wait a minute. I think he needs a rest, too. Yes, I believe he does. It was lucky meeting up with you. I've got a hunch I can use you in my business. I'm almost positive I can use you in mine. What's that? A death mask. Crazy. I don't know why, but I see myself in that. You're very susceptible. If you're interested, I can tell you a great deal about the voodoo rituals. Ted tells me that they try to kill any white man who wanted to see a ritual. And yet you live right in the middle of it. You might say I'm part of it. You, uh, live here alone? My wife occupies that room. Unfortunately, she's not well at the moment. She's... She's mentally sick, severe paranoid, subject to hallucinations of torture and persecution. Oh, Gandor, show our guests to their rooms. I've already told them you're to have complete freedom. How 'bout me? Gandor will act as a sort of personal guide. That's a new name for it. Yes. You're an unusual young woman. I thought you'd be frightened down here. I haven't been scared of anything since I was two years old. I heard that some of these objects are made of gold. Is that why you came here? Yes. Is it true? Oh, Chaka had more gold than you could carry. Will you help me get it? That could mean your life. I'll gamble. What do I do? Undergo the rituals of the god. With my influence, they'll make you a priestess. Then you can have anything the tribe has. I'll do anything they want. We'll talk to Chaka. What's in it for you, doc? The usual? The very unusual. Who are you? What do you want? Ted Bronson, a reluctant house guest. Say, this isn't any medicine for a sick woman. You're wrong. This is what's keeping me alive. He'd kill me if I didn't have this. Who would? My husband. He's crazy! He'll kill you, too. You must get away from here. Get to Bandalaya, bring back help, please! Ah, you're just overexcited. You're imagining things. I didn't imagine that hideous creature he made out of that poor native girl. Made? I saw it, in his laboratory! Be careful. I just thought I'd go for a little walk. You changed my mind, corporal. I can take a hint. They are preparing for one of their most sacred rituals tomorrow night, the festival of the sacrifice. Sacrifice? Generally some member of the tribe who's fallen out of favor. These things made of gold? I'll talk to Chaka. You stay here. Don't touch any of these things. Won't be easy. I've come along way for these. I've brought you the white girl. White woman no take voodoo. This one will. She's born with it in her blood. She'll be perfect. She'll bring you a white man for the sacrifice tomorrow night. You must be completely receptive. Susan, it's me, Ted. How'd did you ever get past Gandor? Even he's gotta sleep sometime. Listen, I had to find out who was crazy, you or your husband. Now I know. I just took a look around his laboratory. He's got everything in there from high octane gas and gun powder to pig's blood. I'm gonna try and make it to Bandalaya. If I'm lucky, I'll be back in a couple of days with help. You could've gotten away. Well, it wasn't as important to... Take me with you. I can make it faster alone. Now you be careful and keep your door locked. I wouldn't want anything to happen to you. We'll make it yet. Be ready to travel. It's working, Chaka. Stop! Too fast! Nothing will stop me now. Nothing will destroy you, not a flame, nor weapons made by man. People say stop. Perfection at last. Very well, I'll take her home. I release you now. You will remember nothing of this. How do you feel? Fine. Is that all there is to it? Until tomorrow night. Better be nice to me, Ted. I become a full-fledged priestess tonight and that makes me eligible for that yellow stuff that you said I'd never get. It's all yours. I'm checking out of here the first chance I get. It won't be tonight. What do you mean? I heard Doc tell Gandor to take you to that big festival tonight. Good dog, Rover. I need you for a moment, Gandor. I'm sure you will excuse him. Don't be too long. Now listen, I'm gonna make a dash for it. Gandor'll follow me. Now you wait five minutes and then you take off. Do you know where the path to Bandalaya takes an eastern turn? You wait for me right there. Oh, Gandor will kill you. No, I don't think so. The doctor wants me at that ritual tonight and I think he wants me alive. Why? I don't know, but I don't mean to find out. Tonight you will leave this form permanently. You will forever remain a being of strength and daring. And as long as I live, I will be your master. You have no life but that which I give you. Now. Evening, Rover. Big doings going on out there, huh? Nice night. You will hear me though I do not speak. Soon we will visit Chaka. You are ready now. Rise! Keep away! You can't kill her. I warned you not to try to escape. Destroy her! You've got to. I don't know that I can. I've given her eternal life. You're insane. You're a maniac! Take her to Chaka. Susan! Put her down. Come along, dear. Chaka's expecting us. Let me go! I'm sorry, dear. You stay there 'til I call you. Here you are, Chaka. I promised you a white sacrifice. Your wife? She was ready to betray me. She means nothing to me. Give her to your gods. Oh no! Oh no! No! Help! Help! Susan! Priest says give all white mans to gods. Tell them their lives are in my hands. At my command, they'll grovel before a new and mightier god. This isn't exactly the way we had planned it, is it? You shouldn't have come back here for me. You could've gotten away. Somehow it wasn't as important without you. Maybe I'll tell you about it someday. Lot of good that will do, but I'll listen. They want you, too. I think this is coming loose. Lean on these ropes. It's coming. Okay, once more now. Your gold is waiting for you. Hurry! The gold! That is my magic. She kill you, too. Stop magic! They thought I'd be a sacrificial victim. Chaka must die, too. Fool. What need have you for gold? Clay, that's all they were. There was only one gold object left, Chaka's idol. He took that with him into the pit. Stop! Stop! You must obey me. You're nothing without me. Nothing! Stop! Stop! It's an old trick, these Molotovs. They're coming here. This at least will get us through. Here they come. If we have any chance at all, it's right now. Sorry I had to do that. Come on, let's go. Bus from Jawar on time? It will be here in a few moments. Oh, good. Marilyn and her friend, they come back with you? They're dead. Dead? She owe me much money. Better luck next time. Her friend perhaps is dead, but not Marilyn. I have a feeling that one still lives.
