How do you see those who strive to remain humble even when they're at the height of their artistic career? People like that... You know what it is? I'm just changing someone's tape here! -It's mine. -Yours? I'll change it for you. -Thanks. -Don't mention it! This is what I use for composing... I bought a computer and now it's where I do my best recordings. Well... I think my family instilled in me a certain way of being and of seeing the world. But it's difficult, because when you get your first taste of success it's overwhelming. It's like this huge monster, and sometimes you don't know how to react. But luckily I have people around me who I've always been able to lean on. Plus, being normal is much easier, right? ON THE 24TH OF JUNE, 2017, A ONE-OFF CONCERT WAS HELD BY MUSICIAN ALEJANDRO SANZ TO COMMEMORATE THE 20TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE RELEASE OF HIS ALBUM MÁS THE HIGHEST-SELLING ALBUM IN SPANISH MUSIC HISTORY Good evening! My name is Alejandro Sánchez Pizarro. Native of Madrid and Cadiz and raised all over the world. I can't think of anything I'd rather do than sing for you for the next 20 years. Have a great night! This is your concert, enjoy it! SANZ: WHAT I WAS IS WHAT I AM To fill a 50,000-seater stadium, first you need to empty a small room and stay there on your own. It's in that solitude that interesting things are created. A MONTH BEFORE THE CONCERT Everyone knows it's not just another rehearsal. It's also a kind of retreat where we can relax and rehearse and create that atmosphere: where we know we're in this together, and it's not just one singer with 20 musicians. Music is the love of my life. My first guitar belonged to my dad. I'd wake up at 6:30 in the morning and start playing it. I remember my mum broke it and I had to stick an ad from a magazine on it to cover up the hole. You'll all leave Time will pass Moments will go by, you'll see. When I tried to convince my mum that I wanted to be a musician, she'd say: "No, son. Making it as a musician is a one in a million chance." And I'd say: "But, Mum, that's me! I'm the one in a million." I'm going to sing a song for my sons Alejandro and Jesús and dedicate it to my husband. FAMILY AUDIO RECORDINGS -Daddy, come on! -You two help her, go on. My heart says... ALEJANDRO'S MOTHER That... Stop laughing or I won't sing! My mum practically raised my brother and I by herself. ALEJANDRO'S BROTHER Back then, an artist like my dad would spend his whole life on the road. My dad covered a million kilometres in his Fiat 600 travelling up and down the country. But then of course my mum was left alone in Madrid with two kids and nobody to help, waiting for her husband to come home which sometimes he didn't. I've travelled to many countries, but I haven't seen anything comparable to this blessed Spain, where I was born And I'm convinced there's nowhere else like it. First he was in the Trío Juventud with two girls from Algeciras. They split up, even though they were great... ALEJANDRO'S AUNT ...and he started a band with two other guys from Algeciras. They were called Los 3 de la Bahía. It was impressive knowing someone whose dad worked in music, played guitar and had recorded an album. He came from a musical background and was starting to play the guitar, like me, FRIEND AND MUSICIAN but he had that environment at home and it really made an impression on me. Let's see what you can do. ALEJANDRO'S FIRST RECORDINGS -Do you want to sing it? -Yes. Go on then, sing it. -Very good, but is that all you know? -Yes! There was a school in Cruz de los Caídos that gave free classes... ALEJANDRO'S MOTHER ONDA LUZ INTERVIEW ...to kids that wanted them, so that's where I took him. It was free. It didn't matter if it came to nothing! I took him there every day. Every single day. My dad always supported my brother. My mum was more reluctant because she knew... ALEJANDRO'S BROTHER ...how hard it was. My mum was always attentive. She wanted me to pass my exams and work in a bank, like all mothers at that time. We started out in music together. We had a heavy metal band! FIRST AND ONLY PERFORMANCE There's a bridge which goes from Moratalaz to La Estrella. It's over the motorway and it's where me and my friend Carlos would go. We imagined the car lights were our audience waving their lighters! We'd stand up there imagining the whole motorway was full of people! As if we were rock stars! 20 DAYS BEFORE THE CONCERT OK, so maybe we deserve it But our voice isn't for sale And whatever they think of us Read my lips I couldn't care less I have a balm for all kinds of pain Remedies for all kinds of mistakes And prescriptions for disappointment These guys say that without the piano and all that it's just over two hours long. FRIEND AND AUTHOR OF THE BIOGRAPHY "VIVE" The way it is right now, the concert's at least three hours long. I don't want people to leave looking at their watches. Let's time it and if we have to cut something, we will. I like it better when it sounds like that. It sounds better than a really good studio recording. Sure, because it's a live recording. There it goes... I liked hard rock and flamenco best. I listened to Camarón and Paco de Lucía from a very young age. Flamenco spoke to me. It got under my skin. Lole and Manuel... Everything my dad used to play in the car when I was little. Little boy... Once upon a time, there was a city... ...that was stranded in the middle of a luminous bay. ALEJANDRO'S FATHER That's why they called it The bride of the sun. Take a guess, take a guess! What town am I from? Once upon a time... Alejandro was born in Madrid and spent many summers at my mother's house. I think that there he found a place to develop his artistic side... ALEJANDRO'S COUSIN AND FLAMENCO EXPERT ...and that's stayed with him his whole career. We've loved flamenco since we were born, so those summers were unforgettable. From when we woke up in the morning to when we went to bed, we'd be playing the guitar non-stop. My mum would be in the kitchen preparing the food... He didn't just bring his guitar when he came, he'd also bring some black trousers and a white shirt, in case Cuadro Soleá had a show. He played the guitar in a lot of our shows. At that time, he already had his own songs. It surprised us, because they were really good. I remember Alejandro saying to me: "We should go to your uncle's house one day. I want him to hear me and see what he thinks." ALEJANDRO'S FRIEND, NEPHEW OF PEPE AND PACO DE LUCÍA We went there a few times and he played him two or three of his own songs, that he'd written himself. He sang them and my uncle loved them. PACO DE LUCÍA AND RAMÓN DE ALGECIRAS That's when I realised who he was: a boy who lived and breathed like a flamenco artist. FLAMENCO SINGER AND COMPOSER He had the flair and charm of a flamenco artist, as if he'd been born here in Cadiz. It was his thing. Once upon a time, there was a white butterfly, HOME RECORDING ...who was the queen of all the dawn butterflies She would land in the gardens among the most beautiful flowers And whisper stories to the carnation and the violet THE 80'S So he could earn some money, my dad found him gigs at nightclubs owned by his friends in Madrid. ALEJANDRO'S BROTHER I used to play in strip clubs and nightclubs, earning basically enough to cover my return taxi fare. I used to sing while the girls got changed, not that they had many clothes to change! It was a real learning experience, because obviously the customers weren't there to listen to me! I'm the same to Alejandro as I could be to any of you. STAR MAKER AND PRODUCER My job is to support talented people who are just starting out and have no other support. Capi was a very atypical producer. He had a real eye for new talent. Capi helped me launch my career. Also Mecano or... SINGER AND COMPOSER Los Pecos, Alejandro... He helped a lot of people. I knew him through my mum and from a photo I'd seen. He was singing at a communion or something like that and he was in a Sevillian folk band with my cousin. When I saw the picture of them, I saw that Alejandro had a special aura. I said: "Bring him to me." And he said to me: "Capi, I want to be in this business even if it's just making coffees." He started giving me work on recordings, doing backing vocals. I also recorded some stuff on the guitar as a session musician. If he needed someone to improvise on an record, he usually called me, I think basically because I had this ballsy approach to it. I met Alejandro in '88. And who was on my books then? Well, I had Fabio, Luis Miguele, Nacho Canut... Alejandro was my last signing of the whole 80s movement. Cocky guys need looking after And you're not doing that Cocky guys need looking after Don't keep me just for the sake of it Cocky guys need looking after I'm out and about all over town Look after the cocky guys And they'll look after you I had a great time making the album, but the album itself... wasn't my style at all. I got to the recording studio and they were all there, and basically all high! I didn't even know what the title meant when they told me! This 18-year-old kid with the biggest gays in Madrid. "Los chulos son pá cuidarlos" wasn't what he wanted to do... ALEJANDRO'S BROTHER ...and they didn't promote it either. In fact, they practically ignored it. "VIVIENDO DEPRISA" DEMO He made the demo of "Viviendo Deprisa". We thought about giving it to another artist and I said: "But you sing it better than anybody." Today the sunset is so short DEMO Our kiss at your front door Isn't like the one yesterday When they heard those demos, they said: "It's really good, but we need to find a song writer." So I asked them to let me go and Javier del Moral asked me for three million pesetas or he wouldn't let me go. So I said: "How am I supposed to pay that? I walked here from Moratalaz! I can't even afford the metro!" In the end Simone Bosé came down. Actually he was pretty fair and said they'd let me go on the condition that I'd only record the songs I'd shown them that they didn't want, no others. That's when I went to see Iñigo Zabala at Warner. Hi, Maria, it's Marta from Warner. I'm calling to talk about... He brought me a cassette with a few songs on it and the first one I listened to really impressed me. Then I heard the second one, which was "Se le apagó la luz", and I was completely... I realised straight away that no one was doing that in Spain or in Spanish music. Why isn't she talking? I don't understand DEMO She was just telling me: Don't go so fast, I'm scared. The ambulance flew by... Obviously Capi had been around the block a few times... I've always been quite tough when negotiating for the artists. So, I sent the demo to José María Cámara, who was the president of BMG. I was at my mum's house, sitting on the floor. Mum was watching a film, shouting at the character on the TV: "Pick up the gun!" "Mum, I've just been offered a million pesetas." "Of course you have, son! A million pesetas! What are you like, boy?" The first call... one. Then every ten minutes it went up, a million at a time. "Mum, I've been offered two!" "What a vivid imagination, son! Shut up, I'm trying to watch the film!" It turned into a bidding war... When Iñigo offered ten million, Ariola offered eleven. That's when Iñigo Zabala called. I spoke from the heart and said: "Look, I don't know what decision you're going to make in the end, but I do know that things are going to go incredibly for you, and whatever decision you make, you're going to be a star and enjoy huge success. I'd like to be a part of it, but I know you're going to make it big." When he hung up, I said: "So then I guess it's Cámara." And he said: "No." "Capi, I want to sign with the other guy." -"But he offered a million less!" -"I know, but... the reason he gave me is worth a million." Viviendo Deprisa got off to a slow start. We sent Alejandro all around Spain in a minibus. He went on all the local radios, singing and playing his guitar. Do you have any other hobbies aside from music? Well, besides music, I like... girls! For all my friends in Algeciras, this is "Viviendo Deprisa"... I wasn't scared of anything. I was used to singing on the streets of my home town. Even though in the end I behaved like a man, I cried And I seriously thought That with that guy, I should have a duel at sunrise A duel at sunrise It started off slowly, but you could see that something was starting to happen. At that time there was no internet, no mobile phones, there was no way to... Music gained popularity in other ways, like when a girl from one town told her mate from the next town, and he told his mates, and so on and so forth... We're here at the Continente supermarket with Alejandro Sanz. The first year was hard work, PRODUCT MANAGER ...he was slowly making a name for himself, but Alejandro didn't get one "no"... Ever. On the same night I'd do a supermarket in Algeciras and a big show in Seville. So I'd finish in Algeciras, get in the car and drive like a fucking maniac, pardon my French, to Seville for the concert. Then the next day I'd go to La Toja, to be on Moreno's show, because that's what everyone did. Remember this name because soon he'll be a huge star! Alejandro Sanz! Today the sunset is so short Our kiss at your front door Isn't like the one yesterday In recent years it's been all about the bands, PROMOTING "VIVIENDO DEPRISA" so for a completely new solo artist with a new album and a style that maybe not everyone's used to, because they're more used to bands playing pop-rock, which is harder, it was pretty complicated. We had to go on the radio, on the Top 40 Show and convince them to play this type of music they didn't normally play. They said Alejandro was old-fashioned. You can imagine the things we had to put up with. The media doesn't realise what it has until the public start taking notice. I'm tired of life, improvising for you I'm tired of following you I'm staying here I've wasted my strength, my love, by living too fast I can't do it anymore Don't wait for me, I'm staying here Back then you knew everyone, the sales directors, the radio people... All the Top 40 radio programmers would meet up the day before the vote, in Ambigú. All the artists would be there and it was like a flea market: "You're supporting me tomorrow, right?" "I'm not sure I like the song." "You can't have heard it properly! Were you high when you heard it?" If we sell 20 thousand copies, they'll want another one next year. Dreaming is so beautiful And the truth so violent I can't take it any more There was a buzz around Alejandro in Spain, but most people didn't know who he was or who the song was by. So we had an idea for Alejandro to do a charity concert. We asked the kids to bring presents for deprived children to put under this huge tree. And we gave those presents to UNICEF along with a donation. Then Television Española suddenly said they'd show it on Christmas evening. FROM THE REAL MADRID SPORTS ARENA I'd already done a lot of concerts, lots of parks, car parks and clubs, but I hadn't really made it yet. It was going well, but I hadn't made it. So when I got to the Real Madrid Arena and heard everyone screaming my name, I realised that something was happening. Hi! I'm so excited to be here for two main reasons: because the tree is full of presents and 'cos tonight we're all going to make a lot of kids around the world very happy. How I feel right now proves to me, once again, that what I was is who I am. I'm not ashamed to say That you were everything to me But I can't admit That I'd like to do it again So much time spent alone So very alone Lost out on the streets There was no sign of you The street was so deserted The night was alive And you speak with such confidence Like you owned the key to my desire And you speak with such confidence Like you owned the key to my desire Come on! Everything I was is who I am. What I brought with me yesterday is what I take with me today Everything I was is who I am. What I brought with me yesterday is what I take with me today Everything I was... There was a moment in that concert when he played this amazing song called "Se le apagó la luz." That was the turning point, when people said: "Wow! This guy isn't just for teeny-boppers." Her light went out He trembled They closed the curtains on her And he heard life pass him by And the soft beating of a heart He understood this was a clumsy farewell To the girl of his dreams Her light went out He trembled Alejandro was really crying. An artist normally releases three or four albums before achieving success, but he got it with his second single. You've no idea how much tonight has meant to me. It was so emotional. I lay down on the dressing room floor trying to get my head round it. My dad was practically drooling over his son. Especially as he was an artist himself... ALEJANDRO'S BROTHER ...and had had to struggle and travel so much just to feed us. The following day, Alejandro went to number one and his albums started flying off the shelves. It really took off that Christmas. We sold a million albums. I did 120 concerts in three months. More concerts than there were days! He went from being a normal kid... ALEJANDRO'S BROTHER ...to a star, and it happened overnight. MORATALAZ NEIGHBOURHOOD At one point, I stopped telling people I was his aunt, because one time, I was in the lift in his building ALEJANDRO'S AUNT with three girls and one said to me: I LOVE YOU, ALEX "You're Alejandro's aunt, right?" And I said: "Yes", and the one next to me started stroking my arm and said: "Oh!" and then fainted! Suddenly we had 100 or 200 girls outside, ALEJANDRO'S BROTHER ...all asking for Alejandro. From then on, when he came to my house, he had to sneak in... FRIEND AND MUSICIAN ...through the garage, because he couldn't go outside anymore! Before we start the interview, we need you all to take a step back. We were in the Plaza de Andalucía and it was total madness. I could see things were getting out of hand for all of us. For the record company, for the artist... Come on, don't do that again! I remember the sound of the barriers screeching on the ground, coming towards us. I felt panicked. I got up from the interview and asked the security guys: "Can you handle this, or should we leave?" So we left. When I started to get my first taste of success, and I went from being just a normal kid to being really well-known in this country, I went to Sanlucar and shut myself away in a house, because it was all just so overwhelming. I had to get used to the success and the fame, to everyone having an opinion of you and not everyone liking you. That makes you vulnerable, in a way, because everyone is giving their opinion of you, saying you're this or you're that. Saying: "What a romantic sap!", Or "that guy's so cheesy!" Or that you're a bad writer or a bad singer. Or that you sing well... You get the whole range of opinions. So you have to be open, but at the same time have this emotional shield up. It's hard to know what to do. How can you do both things at once? It's really difficult. 19 DAYS UNTIL THE CONCERT It's better if you come in on the high note. Like the timid dew on a carnation And I'll come in low... I'll be there Everyone else will leave, I know I'll be by your side through all the hard times Just as the shore stays close to the sea And the field is one With the rain that falls upon it I don't sing in this bit, right? -Perfect. -OK? Let's try it. REHEARSALS WITH PASTORA SOLER Hey, if God exists In whatever shape or form It's simply love If God exists If God exists That's it. Sometimes you need time. It's like a relationship, sometimes you need time apart to make the relationship work. This is the same thing. -Well, you've been really missed. -Really? Yeah, really missed. You should know the stage has missed you! -Well, treat 'em mean..! -Exactly! -Now it'll want me even more! -For sure! -I'm going to go feed my baby. -Sure! -See you later! -Bye, babe! Pastora took a break because she had an episode of stage fright. For a year or two, she didn't sing or record an album, or go on tour... Nothing at all. The first day she sang again was the day of the rehearsal. Watching an artist be reborn like that is a very beautiful thing. I've been close to having something like that happen to me, but I always keep moving forward, 'cos I don't know where else I'd go. He put in a lot of hard work and made his mark in Latin America. There were only a few artists at that time who had the opportunity to do the same, but they decided to focus mainly on the Spanish market. Some of them dabbled a bit over there, but the only one to really put in the time and effort, in that moment, was Alejandro. With a little bit of this and a little bit of that And shake your bum! So, Alejandro, how are you finding Mexico? Everyone's been so friendly. PROMOTING VIVIENDO DEPRISA You're famous for being friendly, but I didn't know quite how much. How long have you been here in Mexico? Not long, about a fortnight, but on the 24th I'm heading to Argentina. He's off to Argentina! I remember him arriving in Argentina practically by himself. He had one rep with him, that's all. PR REP IN ARGENTINA He showed me a list of radio stations, so I said: "These are the important ones." And he said: "No, I'm going to do all of them." -"Every single one." -They took him and his guitar to schools, cantinas and radio stations. But actually, it turned out to be quite unrewarding, because he didn't achieve the recognition he had in Spain. He's well on the road to success, he's the revelation of the '90s, here with you all... VIÑA DEL MAR FESTIVAL Alejandro Sanz! The crowd at Viña del Mar was known as the monster, and it was a monster that really roared! People were whistling booing people off stage, even world-famous artists! Good evening, everybody! We've got a small problem with the keyboard, but we'll get it fixed in no time at all. Can you improvise something in the meantime? -Sure! -This isn't part of the programme, but it's a talent we might never have known about! -Can you hear the guitar? -Yes. When the dawn comes, If I'm not with you, my soul will be broken in two He was there, at the gates to America, where the monster can either kick you out or welcome you in. Don't go! Don't go! If you leave me, my soul will be broken in two Don't go! Don't go! If you leave me My soul will be broken in two I was in pieces when I left the stage, 'cos I wanted to do well at the festival. That was the first time I saw Alejandro cry like a baby, when he came into the dressing room because he'd suffered so much on stage. But after he went on with Miguel Bosé and brought the house down. Alejandro, come up and sing! Tell me the wind Will never destroy it... Hands in the air! Call it freedom Sing it loud, brother, and don't ever, ever stop singing! LONDON I'm dreading unpacking my suitcase, because my mum packed it and she stuffed so much in! There's a bit of everything in there! She thinks I'm going off to war! The madness of loving you Like a fugitive... The madness of loving you... Alejandro was more than what we'd seen on his first album and we wanted to move away from this idea of young music and make a more adult album. Let's get George Michael's arranger, the best engineer in the world, Paul McCartney's drummer... STAR MAKER AND PRODUCER The industry always seduces, it's the sensuality of success. We recorded it and it made a third of the previous album's sales. This is the room where... RECORDING "SI TU ME MIRAS" TOWNHOUSE STUDIO. LONDON, 1993 ...the guitars were recorded. Paco de Lucía recorded here. I said: "Look, Paco, this kid from Algeciras... It's his dream to have you play on one of his songs." "The kid's crazy, totally crazy! You think I'm going to play on your album? Only your second album! So I said: "Just have a listen to the song." Anyway, Paco came to London and asked me: "Who's paying for this, you or the company?" Paco was supposed to come for just a few hours and ended up staying 15 days, wearing the same tracksuit! And a great friendship blossomed between the two artists. The second time he joined us, I told him: "I'm paying for this, Paco." He said: "There's this thermostat for a heater I've got in Xpu-Ha, in Cancun, and I just can't find it anywhere." "OK, what model is it?" "C-301H." So I bought him a whole bag full! I said: "Paco, you'll never need another thermostat again!" So we became friends and always had a really good laugh together. However serious the conversation was, we'd always round it off by playing a bulería! Alejandro, I heard your album's just been released and that it's beautiful. I haven't heard it yet, but I know what you do and how you do it and how you compose. You're an artist and a great singer, with a wonderful sensibility. You're creative and a good person, a really good person. I wish you all the best and all the luck in the world for this new album, but if it doesn't go well, don't you worry, because I know how well you play flamenco guitar and there'll always be a place for you in my group! Take care! Who's joining you for the concert at the Palacio de Deportes in Madrid? My idol my whole life, Paco de Lucía. The master had to be there. It's a dream come true for me to have him on stage with me and the audience. -Shall we listen to it? -Let's do it! For me it was the first The most beautiful melody A captive rose ALEJANDRO SANZ, PACO DE LUCÍA AND PRESUNTOS IMPLICADOS That died when touched When leaving my mouth My lips were kissed By those thankful phrases My first song My first song At that concert, I went out to dance on stage and I could see that people accepted it. They understood that a pop artist could also combine other genres. Life, life, life! ALEJANDRO SANZ, PACO DE LUCÍA AND PEPE DE LUCÍA It's a pastime That's all life is Life, life, life! I think flamenco artists see Alejandro's music... ALEJANDRO'S COUSIN AND FLAMENCO EXPERT as something that's close to them, that they can identify with. And that's because it's a part of his roots. It isn't an impersonation, it's totally real. "EL SUEÑO" ESTATE, CARMONA FAMILY ARCHIVES ALEJANDRO'S FATHER ALEJANDRO'S AUNT Olé, Auntie! 16 DAYS BEFORE THE CONCERT -You don't sing here, right? -No, but it's the same harmony. OK, then it changes... There. One, two, three... Don't cry like that Don't lose hope I know it will come REHEARSAL WITH ANTONIO CARMONA It will come Don't cry like that Don't lose hope I know it will come It will come It all started in Italy. I got a call to record the guitars on the album "3". The tape's finished. At that time, I didn't speak a word of Spanish, but the producer told me they were looking to form a new ensemble... GUITARIST -MUSICAL DIRECTOR ...for this highly gifted artist. RECORDING THE ALBUM3 CONDULME STUDIOS, VENICE, 1993 -This is the part we're changing, right? -That's right. Let's hear it. Alejandro and I didn't have much in common, so he said to me: "Look, instead of doing it the normal way, PRODUCER ...where the arranger and producer give me ideas, let's go into the studio and work together." The thing he did with that guitar... And with the other guy doing it the Italian way... STAR MAKER AND PRODUCER The result was incredible. With 3, we needed substantial sales. We told him the album was missing something, another song. He got mad and went home... He didn't take it too well. The next month he brought us five songs: the five singles from the album! It was unbelievable! They all arrived at the party Who knows what for REJECTED DEMO The famous arrived How sensitive they are Claiming to fight hunger They enjoy their feasts With napkins made from the Amazon rainforest It's true that since 3, FRIEND AND COMPOSER Alejandro has always, always recorded what he wanted to record. I think Alejandro has had a better understanding of his career since the label started respecting his choice of songs. In the case of Más, which is the highest-selling album in this country's music history, and not only in terms of business, but also in terms of impact, PRESIDENT UNIVERSAL MUSIC SPAIN ...is and always will be a reference for pop music in our language. -Vicente Amigo is coming. -Which tracks is he going to play on? -On "Corazón", right? -Yup, on "Corazón Partido." The best thing is to do what I've always done, which is simply to write for myself. When you write for yourself, everyone gets it. He's a chronicler of life. The loves, the losses, the friendships, the strife, it's all in there. I've seen him experience real suffering, because he loves so much. 12 DAYS UNTIL THE CONCERT Three people to turn on a tap! This is getting out of hand. Alejandro says he's a good cook and actually his rice is good, FRIEND AND LAWYER ...but it's always the same! He can't tell if the potato's hard! When it's ready, he seasons it and gives everyone a spoonful to try. He does the same with his albums. When the song's ready, he'll give it to you to see if it's seasoned, if it tastes good, if the song's finished. -It has a bitter aftertaste. -A bit. Maybe it's the vinegar. Add some coriander. Alejandro was growing and growing as a composer, but with Más he excelled himself. The album was already incredible. It had "Y Si fuera Ella", "Amiga mía"... The album was going to be huge. Alejandro called me and said: "You have to listen to this." And suddenly, I was listening to "Corazón Partido". Who will give me their emotions? Who will ask me to never leave them? Who will tuck me in tonight if I'm cold? Who will mend my broken heart? Who will fill this January with spring? Who will bring the moon down so we can play? Tell me, if you leave Tell me, my love Who will mend my broken heart? Some people at my record label didn't want me to say I liked flamenco, they wanted me to take diction lessons to hide that I was Andalusian. Things like that. Nothing that sounded like flamenco went on the radio. That song was a little outside the box, but it was so good that we decided to include it. We recorded that song with musicians past and present. And that chorus... It was magical. That fusion of pop, Latin and flamenco... Even though we didn't know exactly where we were going with it, Alejandro said: "No, it's too pop, the song deserves something more." PRODUCER So it was really him who came up with the idea. One day I picked up the tapes and said: "OK, let's see... What's missing here?" In the end Capi brought in Ludo Pérez, and he gave it the final touch. He gave it that extra groove. He added some Latin percussion and then the mix was really unique. Who will give me their emotions? Who will ask me to never leave them? Who will tuck me in tonight if I'm cold? Who will mend my broken heart? Who will fill this January with spring? Who will bring the moon down So we can play? Tell me, if you leave Tell me, my love Who will mend my broken heart? You know the plaster company wanted to sue me? They told me to take it out and I said: "No, I won't." "Plasters" isn't a brand name. Just like "Jacuzzi" isn't a brand either. Plasters for my broken heart. Oh, my heart! GUITARIST -MUSICAL DIRECTOR Is that Ludo? Ludo, how are you? Perfect, OK? I want them all to play together. We've got such a powerful band, splitting them up is stupid. Mike and Ludo. -We have to organise things. -I know. Look. I've been with him since '98, when I played on Más... PERCUSSIONIST ...and now I'm back with my colleagues from 20 years ago. It says a lot about Alejandro that he called us again. GUITAR I always had my camera with me back then, KEYBOARDS so now we're doing it again, I watched the footage back. Tell me, if you leave Tell me, my love Who will mend my broken heart? Yesterday I was rehearsing and there was Helen... PIANIST ...from '98, and then Txell from 2001 and Sara from 2007 next to Victor... They were all there together. We've got all the years rolled into one. 9 DAYS UNTIL THE CONCERT I've put the two bands together, the one I had in '98 and the one I have now. PRESS CONFERENCE, +ES+ EVENT MAY, 2017 It's been a really cool process, because some of them weren't even working as musicians anymore. So it's been a bit like Ocean's Eleven, when they get the old crew together for one last job, or something like that! We ask you, as always, out of courtesy not only for the artist, but for all of us here today, not to smoke and to turn off your mobile phones, so as not to be a nuisance or to interfere with the sound people. PRESS CONFERENCE, MÁS ALBUM SALES May, 1998 Artists with the one million trophy can be counted on two hands, but artists with the trophy for 1,300,000 EX-PRESIDENT WARNER MUSIC can't be counted, because there's only one: Alejandro Sanz. The album went to number one and I think it stayed there for two years straight. That had never happened before in Spain. The title is fitting for sure! It looks like the album is going well, so when's the tour going to start? The tour starts... I've got it written down, because otherwise, as I'm sure you can imagine... People ask me if I believe in destiny. Why wouldn't I? My destiny's sorted until December! The tour starts... -It starts on the 11th of June in Murcia. -Ah. -Thank you! -That was funny! -How did I do? -Fantastically, as always! Discreet as well as elegant, simple and youthful! MÁS TOUR SPAIN, 1998 The first concert on the Más tour. I only know that... GUITARIST ...the curtain went up, my equipment was there on the floor... I looked over and saw him and then we started playing. I can't remember anything else! It was like a dream that starts, then ends and you're not aware of it until it's over. My friend Maybe one of these days I'll finally learn To speak without going round in circles All of this matters to me Because you're my friend When we did the first concert it was like, wow! PERCUSSIONIST It was like, where am I? What is this? Being in a stadium... The audience gives off this avalanche of energy that's like being hit by a brick wall! I'd never before experienced the sound KEYBOARD ...of girls screaming non-stop at 126dB! Thank you! Thank you so much! There were always the same fans in the front row. One day they'd have a banner for you, the next day for Alejandro... So we had this kind of visual connection. There was one fan who hated my guts. BACKING VOCALS She would give me the finger. It was horrible! Alejandro started saying that I was his cousin, because the girls would throw things at me. Seriously! You'd see the girls in the front row... GUITARIST ...and they'd all be fainting constantly! The newspapers, instead of reviewing the concert, BASS PLAYER ...would say: "Alejandro Sanz's record! 200 and something girls fainted!" No more reasonable doubts There's no comparison for me That final moment robbed me Of the miracle of having you all the time Let's get this over with A century should be long enough This final moment belongs to us both And the others, well they can wait This final moment belongs to us both And the others, well, they can wait And no more reasonable doubts This final moment belongs to us both And the others, well they can wait And the others... When we were on tour with Más, the exact same final was on: Real Madrid -Juventus. Isn't that crazy? It's incredible we're all together, 20 years on, and the same final is on. And the big final is underway... EUROPEAN CUP FINAL Guitar! Let's go! Let's go! I think it'll be... CHAMPIONS LEAGUE FINAL, 2017 ...4-1. He's going to miss it... I reckon so. -That fucking English what's-his-name! -I'm so sorry! I'm happy Madrid lost too! Josep! In the pool! Look, look! Juve got fucked this year! Arriving at airports was... PERCUSSIONIST They had to rush Alejandro through. But him being him, he wanted to sign autographs for everyone. So they'd have to drag him away: "Come on! Let's go!" Or we'd never have got out of there! I haven't done anything, I swear! I haven't done anything! Frisk me then! -Wait. -Frisk him. The '98 programme, for example, didn't look too bad, but we had gigs in Guatemala, then New York, then Washington, Chicago... "Alejandro-mania" had reached Mexico. One day, we had a reporter NATIONAL AUDITORIUM MEXICO. MARCH 1998 from El País coming to cover the concert. He was quite a tough critic and the guys from the label were a bit nervous he was coming. I'd sung the previous night and it had gone down a storm. So the night before this guy was due to come, I stayed up with Pancho Céspedes and the musicians in the room singing and drinking tequila until the crack of dawn. We like having fun. The next day I woke up and I'd completely lost my voice! So I went on stage, went to sing the first line and I had no voice! What else could I do but go back inside and leave my musicians playing the song? BASS PLAYER He locked himself in the dressing room and wouldn't come out. Iñigo Zabala was there so I said: "Iñigo, what am I going to do?" I went into the dressing room and said: "Alejandro, we can't cancel. You can't do that to your fans. Go out there and tell them to sing with you. Tell them you need their help." So I went back out and said: "Look, I've obviously lost my voice. If you want to leave, you'll get your money back. But if you stay, you're going to see the best concert of the whole tour!" I've been distracted lately I'm doing everything wrong I'm a disaster And I don't know what's going on The crowd sang the first few songs and Alejandro sang the ends of the lines. By the middle of the concert, he was managing to sing about half the songs. And by the end Alejandro was sounding like Pavarotti! You're that woman I feel this man can love I live each second As if it were the first time Knowing that you loved me Everything you gave me When we finished the concert, the musicians lifted me up on their shoulders like a hero. And the crowd... It was really emotional. The next day, the guy from El País wrote a rave review. I've cancelled very few concerts in my life. You have to do everything in your power for the show to go on. I mean, I was born to be on stage, it's what I do. -Thanks, Alejandro! Look what we've got! -Get well soon, Alejandro! That's right. First let me just say, I got married! Now we can start the press conference! Alejandro got back from Bali, a newlywed, and started getting harassed by the press and the media. He came to my house and I said: "You can stay here for as long as you want, no problem." SINGER AND COMPOSER A year and a half! He brought his piano over, got settled in, and started composing El alma al aire. A WEEK BEFORE THE CONCERT I write a lot of my songs in 12/8 or 6/8 time. I write them in the bulería or alegría style and then I translate them, so to speak, into pop, but I leave that time hidden in the songs so that whoever needs to hear it will. For example, "Cuando nadie me ve..." People hear the song like this... Sometimes I rise up Do a thousand cartwheels Sometimes I lock myself away behind open doors But really it's like this... Sometimes I rise up Do a thousand cartwheels Sometimes I lock myself away behind open doors Sometimes I explain this silence to you Sometimes I'm yours And sometimes I belong to the wind I mean, that's the tempo. That's why in the video I'm walking with that rhythm. When nobody sees me MUSIC VIDEO RECORDING. 2000 I can be or be nothing When nobody sees me I look like your skin When nobody sees me I think about her too When nobody sees me I can be or be nothing When nobody sees me I can be or be nothing When nobody sees me I'm not confined to my skin With Más came recognition, with El alma al aire came confirmation. The winner is... Alejandro Sanz. I'd like to dedicate this award to my dad, who's sitting right there. LATIN GRAMMY AWARDS 2nd EDITION, LOS ANGELES El alma al aire! Who said "Me vale madre"? That's a lot of gold! My friend, 55,000 tickets sold, plus the 5,000 who sneak into each gig and the 5,000 who get in free, that's more than 60,000 people watching you. Is this the biggest crowd you've ever performed for? Yes, I think so. It's also symbolic, because this is a place where all the best artists have played and which no Spaniard has ever filled before. She slides in and bowls me over VICENTE CALDERÓN STADIUM MADRID 2001 And although sometimes I don't care I know the day I lose her I will suffer again Because of her Who appears and then hides away Who leaves and then stays Who is both the question and the answer Who is my darkness My star El alma al aire gave us the Alejandro who performed in stadiums with an amazing band, amazing lights, putting on incredible show. How do you measure your success? On awards? On ticket sales? Not me. My prize is going on stage and hearing 40,000 or 50,000 people singing one of my songs. Six? 5 DAYS BEFORE THE CONCERT -You know what? -What are you doing? We've got a cheating pianist! -No! -Hey! Go on then! Take your five points! I thought they were my points! -The pianist. -Where is it? I didn't touch anything! -He had one and now he has two! -Short memory! -A short memory is worthless. -Sure. A long-term memory, that's the one... -Do you remember the unplugged gig? -My memory's not that bad! MTV was the logical result of everything that was happening. The Grammys, an international career... No Spanish artist had ever done MTV Unplugged before. I had rehearsal at 8:00 a.m. I woke up to the news of 9/11. The Grammys got cancelled and I couldn't do the Unplugged concert in Miami either. So... We interrupt the MTV scheduled broadcast to bring you news of the attack on the US. The title of the song reflects what people are probably wondering: "What can I do for others? How can I help others?" We've suddenly realised that terrorism isn't as far removed from us as we thought. But there are many other things we should also take into account, so I think asking that question is the best that a person can give. From the top! When I'd finished the song my producer said: "Michael Jackson wants to talk to you. Call him." I wanted to tell Michael Jackson, as a joke: "Don't go saying we're mates now, just because we spoke on the phone." Just a little joke, you know? But in English... it's tricky! You know the day Más came out, he died? Are we playing or talking here? MTV UNPLUGGED TONIGHT PRESENTS ALEJANDRO SANZ RECORDING "MTV UNPLUGGED" GUSMAN CENTER, 2001 Lord of infinite spaces You that holds peace in your hands Let it spill out Lord I'm begging you And teach my brothers how to love And teach them how beautiful life is And how to heal all wounds And to show pure love to the whole world And always seek out love, Lord And hate war I'd like to be the air That escapes from your laugh I'd like to be salt That stings in your wounds ALEJANDRO SANZ AND DESTINY’S CHILD I'd like to be the blood That your life wraps around OK, so maybe we deserve it But our voice isn't for sale And whatever they think of us Read my lips, I couldn't care less El alma al aire marked the beginning of the "Miami" period and "No es lo mismo" is totally the Miami-style Alejandro and I think that really shines through. RECORDING "NO ES LO MISMO" MIAMI, 2003 Stop, stop, stop! He went to work with Lulo Pérez... FRIEND AND AUTHOR OF "VIVE" ...and made his first fully American album. He stopped working with a lot of people he'd been with for years. He stopped working with Emanuele Ruffinengo, he stopped working with Capi. Alejandro reinvented himself. He took on Latin music, Cuban music... Miami was a great influence for him and then he reinvented himself once again. -I'm knackered! -I said: "I can't go on like this. I've got nothing left to contribute, I'm out." I even broke the contracts we had together. Now, I'd like to invite on stage... CHARITY CONCERT ...somebody who has helped me and has helped all us artists and the "Alas movement"... Alejandro Sanz! Alejandro has always been a pioneer. The urban phenomenon might seem like something new, but "La Tortura" became the most played Spanish song in history. It sold more than 12 million singles. It was number one in the USA. And it's undoubtedly a song that was ahead of its time. It also coincided with the most charitable moment of his career. I know I haven't been a saint ALEJANDRO SANZ AND SHAKIRA But I can fix that my love A man can't live on bread alone And I can't live on excuses You learn from your mistakes And I know that my heart is yours Better keep it for yourself Give the bone to another dog And let's say goodbye I think we're at a time where everyone is very conformist and I don't think that's good for anybody. If at this point in my life, when professionally I'm in this privileged situation, GREENPEACE EXPEDITION THE ARCTIC ...I don't take risks, then when will I? I don't understand this hunger. The hunger of people who have it all. I don't get it. The way our society is conceived, economically and socially, we're losing more and more democracy. -What's your name? -Alejandro. Companies and large corporations are now the ones with the power and that's very dangerous. 3 DAYS BEFORE THE CONCERT Nice to meet you all! Under the rain and under the sun The daisy said no CHOIR REHEARSAL "SAFARI CHILDREN" Under the rain and under the sun The daisy said no Under the rain and under the sun The daisy said no In "La Margarita dijo no", the kids come out with flags. -Do we have the flags? -Yes. -They have to enter from both sides. -Yes, in two lines. -They enter in two lines and spread out. -That's already choreographed. -There's no problem with that. -Sure. What may seem marvellous to you today can seem horrible tomorrow. And the day after you think it's sublime. So you always need somebody you can trust who'll tell you: "Stop there, that's enough, leave it like that." Alejandro's dad, Jesús, had that someone too. He was more than a friend. FRIEND AND MUSICIAN He was at all his concerts and on all his tours. It was like he was an extension of Alejandro! I'd say: "Alejandro, watch out with him. Careful with this one, that one." FRIEND AND COMPOSER Those truths that people don't often tell an artist. My dream is for everyone to be happy, INTERVIEW BY MONIKA BELLIDO (COUSIN) OF JESÚS SÁNCHEZ (FATHER) ...for there to be no wars or diseases and for everybody to be OK. -What's your favourite dish? -Stew. Are you superstitious? I'm not superstitious, it's bad luck! With your sideways smile DEMO How many I love yous Did you keep inside? How many of your boyhood things Do you still keep in your pockets? With your eternal cigarette The bags under your eyes And your carelessness The most beautiful of dances Is your limp when you walk I imagine you put on weight To make room for your soul You are that friend Who gave me life I think he felt that he'd left him too soon... SINGER AND FRIEND ...and it really affected him. When he lost his dad, ALEJANDRO'S AUNT ...it was really hard for him. Especially because he'd just separated from Jaydy as well, so it was a really tough time for him. He called me up and said: "Why don't you come over to Miami? For a month or however long you want." ALEJANDRO'S UNCLE I said: "OK, I'll come. Something must be up if you're calling me like this." And so I went over there. Paco was there. He was telling me that the boy was in a bad way. I'd been in the house by myself for six years and the people I had around me were trying to stitch me up. They were blackmailing me with things from my private life. They had my divorce settlement, SANZ'S EMPLOYEES BLACKMAILED HIM FOR HALF A MILLION DOLLARS ...photos and stuff they'd found on my computer that they said they were going to make public unless I gave them half a million dollars. And I said: "That's not going to happen. That's not going to happen." We've seen people try... THE TREACHEROUS EMPLOYEES ...to take advantage of his good heart and his good faith and we've had to go to court. SANZ'S TESTIFIES FOR 5 HOURS AGAINST HIS EMPLOYEES We had to release a statement in November, 2006, about a son he had, whose identity he wanted to protect. We've been through a lot. I think it's the darkest stage Alejandro has been through. We all have skeletons in our closets. Why should he be any different? My favourite album is El tren de los momentos. I'd locked myself away. My inner world had taken over my outer world. My house was chaos, a complete mess. I painted the walls, hung photos... All my drunk muses were there, strewn around the house. My inner world is my refuge, but it can also be my hell. RECORDING "EL TREN DE LOS MOMENTOS" It's where I've fought my battles and some I win, some I lose. He recorded it in a room in his house in Miami where he also... had a canvas and where he painted compulsively. I don't think it was his happiest time. It's a very sincere album. It was a kind of scream of desperation. To the first person Who helps me get out Of this hell I myself chose to live in ONDAS AWARDS, 2006 I'll give us any afternoon What I'm saying is that Right now I have no place to be Whoever wants gold can have it But if we talk about yesterday I have drunk so much And yet I am still thirsty At least you knew At least I didn't tell you That things weren't as they seemed But to the first person Who helps me to feel again I intend to give them my life I intend to give them my faith But if you're not the person I dreamt of, then what for? What can I do? Nothing What will I do with the dreams? What will I do with those kisses? What can I do With everything we dreamt about? Tell me where can we put it? Where do I keep that look you once gave me? Where do I keep the promises? Where do I keep yesterday? Baby, where do I keep the way you touched me? Where do I keep my faith? Even though people say it I don't want to hear it There's nothing so frightening as when you feel nothing Baby, you think it's so easy Oh, my love! But the easier you see it The more difficult it is for me To the first person who helps me to walk I intend to give you my time I'll even give you the sea I'm not saying it's easy But baby Right now I have no place to be 1 DAY BEFORE THE CONCERT When I started working with Alejandro he'd just released El tren de los momentos. I suddenly saw this van drive up and stop in front of me. I got in and sat down and it was really dark inside. We couldn't barely see each other! ALEJANDRO'S WIFE We said: "Hi", "Hi"... -"How are you?" -"Fine." "You're gorgeous". But he couldn't see me! I knew he had a good sense of humour and that he was very charming. That was the first time I spoke to Alejandro. We liked each other straight away. We got on really well. Various circumstances came together at that time in Alejandro's life. He had to overcome many things and that's exactly what he did. Sara likes snails! Sometimes I feel lost Restless, alone and confused So I tie myself to the stars And circle the whole world To this wounded heart REHEARSAL Music makes sense We give you wings with this voice We help your feet to walk I'm singing for somebody like you These are chestnuts. Alejandro's whole family is like a family to me. His mum has always been very sweet to me. She is so much fun. She has six brothers and she's the only girl, so she had to develop a strong character. She never has her ID or any money on her! His mum was a real family person. When she came to visit, we'd spend all our time together. She never organised anything outside of the family. ALEJANDRO'S UNCLE This is my uncle. He's always the best informed about everything. -And my cousin. He's not bad at cards. -Yeah, right! You're terrible! And I'm always there next to you, trying to... And you can always tell what hand he's got! Yeah 'cos when he's got a bad hand, he goes like this! -You move it around the pan. -Move it round and round. Turn it over, leave it to brown and pim pim, that's that! And that's that! No! I look awful! -You look beautiful! -Don't be silly! Beauties are always beautiful. ALEJANDRO'S AUNT I've spent my life with my sister-in-law. She was happy with me and with Manolo, just as I was with her. Alejandro said to me: "Aunty, will you come and live here? It's what mum would've wanted." It had been his mum's plan, so that's what he wanted, for us to be here all together, and we've been here five years now. When you have the life of an artist, you find yourself within a small group you can't get out of, so that group has to be fun or it has to be full of something, because you live somewhat isolated from the rest of the world. I have a lot of cousins. We all get together at Christmas, there's between 60 and 90 people. That's why I bought this place, so we could to get together here like I did with my family as a boy. We'd kind of got out of the habit, as we had nowhere to all meet up. My children will inherit this place, on one condition: they can't sell it. This is for the family. A place where the whole family can... You know? Be together for generations to come and have a place that is just ours. And this is it. -It's beautiful. -Yeah! The wall's really changed. Before it was just a wall, now you have colours and life. It's been incredible working for you. You're quite something, mate! I love it! -I'm happy to hear that. -Thank you. Really. HOME RECORDINGS Painter Born in my land With a foreign brush Painter who follows in the steps Of so many painters gone before Although the Virgin is white Paint me black angels I can feel you here with me. I need your support on the day. This is for you. That's what I love about forests, it's like entering into a promise. It's like you're experiencing an emotion. That's the thing about forests. Twenty years, we drank from the same cup DAY OF THE CONCERT MADRID, 24th JUNE, 2017 Sharing emotions So many things we still do together Twenty years We are lives that touched each other VICENTE CALDERÓN STADIUM We don't even think about it anymore I could caress your words We walk together Without resting our lips And we let time go by And the sound of uncertainty When something new is coming our way But our love is bulletproof And the battles only make it stronger I bring to you The memories that you and I create Emotions There's a fire inside me for you What I learnt What I dreamt The twenty times we've been around this sun I bring to you Don't forget what we said to each other Even if time has erased A million of my verses There's nothing that can Take that taste away from me Twenty years Twenty years Twenty years Twenty years I bring to you I bring to you I bring to you I bring to you I bring to you In the end, success isn't about trends or the market, none of that. It's about showing an artist's heart. When nobody sees me I can be or be nothing When nobody sees me Sometimes I rise up Do a thousand cartwheels I lock you away in my eyes Behind open doors Sometimes I explain this silence to you At times I'm yours I guess this nostalgic celebration has been quite natural for him. Like someone inviting all their friends over for dinner. It happened spontaneously. But I think that everyone sees it as a gift to all of his fans. Yeah! Algeciras in the house! Take a guess! What town am I from? Take a guess Take a guess I'll give you a kiss Who will give me their emotions? Who will ask me to never leave them? Who will tuck me in tonight if I'm cold? Who will mend my broken heart? The first time I played at Calderón, I told people: "I was sat there once wondering when it would be my turn to play in a place like this." I was dreaming big, but that's the only way to dream. One... There in a dark patio... -Alejandro, get your guitar. -Do you know the words, Alejandro? I want to sing... Come on then! You always say the same thing! -I always dream about a balloon. -Really? -Yes. -Good evening ladies and gentlemen! Here for your delight, a genius of the modern song... Jury Venturi! Jury Venturi, please, tell us, how long will you be in Spain for? Twenty years! I AM WHAT I WAS This is an honour I find it hard to believe I deserve, as I still see myself as that little boy sitting next to his dad, trying to imitate his chords. My fingers couldn't reach a lot of the positions, just as my heart couldn't be filled with more gratitude for this recognition. I present this award for the Latin Recording Academy's person of the year, 2017, to my friend, Alejandro Sanz! Music is untouchable Music's always there, you'll see. Long live music! Tell us what the song is about. When an artist writes a song, we call it composing, and when they mess up, can we call it decomposing? For sure! That's exactly it! His attitude is that of a musician, not of a star, which is what most singers have. Nice! Really nice! ...and mysteries, six by six The centuries, the dead And the restless that cry out We'll all go, yet it will still remain Remember it A song Music is untouchable And what the wind blows away Is the safest thing Have no doubt It grabs hold of time And lasts forever in our hearts We'll all go, yet it will still remain Remember it A song Music is untouchable There's no law A powerful emotion That not even time can defeat There's no law Whatever you love Will remain in time It will still be here When we're gone It will still be here when you're gone Music will remain Music's always there, you'll see Long live the music Your Majesty God save the music In all its splendour Music will remain When there's nobody to love Music will remain Like an awakening Music will remain Long live music The music will remain... Chile! Let me hear you! Viña! The Golden Music Award, 2017, in recognition of his whole career, goes to the master, Alejandro Sanz! Music will remain It's all about the music Time to wake up Long live music Your Majesty God save the music In all its splendour Music will remain When there's nobody to love Music will remain Like an awakening We'll still have the music It's our truth Music is untouchable It's the main event To finish, a very well-known tune. That's it!
