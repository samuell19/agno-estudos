Blind men's pilgrimage. Is there a man named Ichi here? You're looking for a blind man named Ichi? Hey, Ichi! You're not him. My name is Matsu no Ichi, sir. Excuse me, sir. My name is Sugi no Ichi. I'm Yo no Ichi. I'm He no Ichi. We are all named Ichi, sir. Quiet! Cut it out! We're not looking for a masseur. Line up over there. Move it! No need to be so rough. Show me your face. You there. Look at me! He's not here. Damn it! Where the hell did he disappear to? He's blind. He can't have gotten very far. Thank you all for your kind help. I'm very much obliged. You saved my skin. We blind folk need to help each other out. It was fun to play a joke on those sighted men. Yes, it definitely livened up our day. It was the most fun we've had in quite a while. Well, I think I'll be on my way. Sighted people can be awfully cruel to the blind, so please be careful. Thank you. Perhaps we'll meet again sometime. Good-bye. Please be careful. Don't let those sighted rogues harm you. Hello there, sir. Care to give those legs a rest? No, thanks. We're on our way back without a fare. Why don't you hop in? No, really. Thanks. We'll give you a deal: 30 mon. That's half price. Half price? Normally we couldn't give you such a good deal, but since you're blind... Yeah, it's a real steal. Well, perhaps I will. On second thought, no. Why not? I can't see, but I've got perfectly good legs. We'll make it 20 mon, then. Twenty mon is practically free. Come on. Get in. Fifteen mon. Hey! That's Zatoichi! All right! We'll take a shortcut and get ahead of him. Are you all right, ma'am? What's wrong? I got a sudden cramp. - A cramp? - Watch out. This doesn't sound good. - Thank you. - Excuse me, ma'am. Please take my palanquin. I couldn't do that. You'd do the same for someone else in need. Please take my palanquin. We got him! The bastard's finally dead. Hey, it's the guy we were carrying! We were attacked! Right here, sir. Are you all right, ma'am? Are you all... You must be the village headman. Hurry. Hurry. I'm afraid this was all my fault. I have no idea who the lady was... that child's mother. Would anyone here happen to know her? According to these travel documents, the murdered woman was on her way home to her husband, who lives in Miyagi Village in Ina County. Miyagi Village? Her husband was apparently a silkworm cocoon broker named Unosuke. So he was a hardworking man. There's also a promissory note here, which suggests this Unosuke must have run out of money while traveling. He left his wife as collateral against a loan of five ryo in Nirazakizai. Five ryo? Then his wife must have worked to pay off the debt and earn her freedom. May I ask how far it is to this Miyagi Village? - Maybe 60 or 65 miles. - No, it's farther than that. Are you thinking of delivering the child to his father? I'd like to meet this man named Unosuke in person and tell him how sorry I am. Tsuchihei and Umasuke, sorry to saddle you with this, but I'd like you to accompany this man to Miyagi. - But, sir... - Do you understand? Such a good baby. Let's change your diaper. Good baby. That's a good baby. I'm going to take you to your daddy now, so don't you worry about a thing. I'm so sorry about... I guess it's a boy. He seems to be in good health. Please take this lock of hair from the deceased with you. - Shall we take care of him? - No, not here. He'll still be on guard, expecting us. But we've got him right there. We won't lose him. He's got a baby with him now. He's bound to let down his guard. When the time is right, I'll give the word. Man, are my shoulders sore. Umasuke! Look! Uh-oh. I count five. You must be the ones who killed the poor kid's mother. Forget her. All we care about is removing that head from your shoulders. We need you dead, or it'll be a stain on our name. This is about money, I suppose. Someone offered to pay you to kill me. And you've already taken the money. That's how we make our living. So there's not much point in my trying to avoid you people, I guess. But there's one problem. I have to deliver the baby to his father's arms in Miyagi. Could we wait to have our showdown until after that? How about it? Once I've delivered the baby, I'll face off with you anytime you like. If my proposal is agreeable to you, then perhaps you'd be so kind as to let me through. You call yourselves human beings? So long as you can fill your own purses, you don't give a damn what it might mean to someone else. Not even to an innocent child. That's right, Ichi. We don't give a damn about others. That's the code we live by. And that's why the Monju clan has never once failed to kill a man it has targeted. Rest assured. In time we'll put you to rest too. Remember that. Master Tsuchihei? Master Umasuke? Your companions rushed off in a panic a while ago. It must be tough, traveling with a little one like this. Are you perhaps on your way to Zenkoji Temple? Uh-huh. He's such a cute little thing. What's the matter, child Why do you cry so Have Mother's breasts run dry Or has she passed away On the hill over yon A cripple walks by His hat bobs into sight Then bobs out of sight again Hey there, Waheiji. Hangoro? I never expected to run into you around here. What are you up to? Hold on just a second. You have to tell me when you want to pee. In a second. I'm getting you a fresh diaper. You'll feel better in a jiffy. There you go. That does it. He stopped crying. Babies know what they want. Feel better? It's no laughing matter. I don't suppose it is. But you know, I've considered putting a price on Zatoichi's head too, but if he's giving even you a hard time, I suppose I'd best let sleeping dogs lie. Not at all. Zatoichi's a man like the rest of us. No question about that. If a respected gangster lets some sorry blind man intimidate him, it could seriously damage his reputation. Isn't that right, Hangoro? You're a clever one, Waheiji. Why don't you just come out and say it? Say what? You're asking for our help, right? You guessed it. We could split the prize money fifty-fifty. Never mind that. What won me over was that bit about the serious damage it could do to a gangster's reputation if Zatoichi is allowed to keep swaggering around. - So you'll help us? - You bet. Where'll I find a better memento of this trip to Minobu? It's decided, then. Let's get going right away. No sense in putting off a good thing. Hey, Pops. Give me the bill. No, Hangoro. I can't let you do that. Excuse me. Is there a scarecrow around here somewhere? A scarecrow? Yes, there is. There is? Great. I'm in luck. I'm sorry, but could you perhaps lead me to the scarecrow? I'm blind, you see. Would you be so kind? Just walk straight and you'll come to it. She was right. Thank you very much, miss. Here we are. I know you've been waiting. I'll change your diaper in a minute. Yes, you definitely peed, didn't you? Give me a second. We've got all the diapers we'll ever need now. I just have to get them ready. See the pretty diapers? You'll feel much better now. You could at least let me change the baby's diapers in peace. Don't you think? And then there were four? Everything's going to be okay now. I scared all the bad men off. Let's be on our way. Everybody ready? Here goes. Place your bets, everyone. Hey, mister. Are you going to bet? I'm still talking it over with the little one. Which shall it be? Odd or even? Even. The bets are in! Two and two, even. Now I can buy you some softer diapers, kid. Here we go again. Place your bets. I'll stick with even. All bets are in. What do we have? Five and five, even. What's the matter? That strange masseur is having quite a run. It's all right. Let him ride for now. We'll get it back later. Uh-oh, what's going on here? Damn it, you messed your pants. What'll it be, mister? I guess I'll bet on even again. - The bets are in. - What do we have? Two and six, even. Hey, mister. Could I interest you in a little one-on-one with me? You must be the host of the game. Sure, that'll be fine. Gambling is best when it's one-on-one. I like your spirit. Let's see. I guess I'll take these lucky chips and place them all on even again. Then I'll bet on odd. If the rest of you would like, I invite you to put your chips in with mine and bet on even. As you can see, I may be blind, but I do have an eye for gambling. Go ahead. We're betting on even. Is that it? Everyone's in? It's turned into quite a sum. Now then, boss, will you accept all these bets? Sure thing. You've got balls, mister. Now, gentlemen, just to be clear, I'm betting on odd. Odd. Is that clear? You put your chip in too, kid. Ready? Here we go. The dice sounded different that time. Don't be ridiculous. No, really. I may be blind, but I'm very sensitive to sound. Don't be ridiculous. Come on. Let's see them. What do we have? We'll play with those dice, if you please. Odd. It's got to be odd. What do we have? Even! It's really even? This really is my lucky day. I believe I'll call it an evening. Thanks for looking after the baby, miss. That's a good baby. Let's go get you a clean diaper. Excuse me, but where do I cash in my chips? There he is! No one picks up and leaves right after winning big! And nobody messes with our dice! This way, please. Right here. Thanks. In here? Excuse me. Here we are, kid. I'm much obliged. You must be a real greenhorn. What did you bring a baby along for? Actually, your customer is the baby. The baby? I just want a good night's sleep. Here are the diapers. And this here is some rice water, in place of mother's milk. Here. Please take the baby. What is this, some kind of joke? You really expect me to take care of the baby? Keep him happy. Keep him from crying until morning and I'll give you an extra tip. Aren't you lucky, getting to sleep with this pretty young lady? Good night, kid. I don't believe this. You're a queer one, aren't you? But fine. Go ahead and get your sleep. This makes it easier on me too. Much easier. Goodness! What're you doing? - Sorry. It's because I can't see. - You startled me. Oh, yeah. I have this too. You do this. When the baby cries, if you rattle the string like this, he'll soon stop crying. There you go. Now I can get a good night's sleep for a change. I'm a lucky man. Good baby. Let's go to sleep now. Has he gone to sleep? You'll wake him up. He's just drifting off. He is? Good. Thanks. I'll go to sleep too, then. What's the problem now? I wanted to change his diaper before I went to sleep. Could you reach that bag for me? Why don't you just leave it to me? If he wets his diaper, I'll take care of it. You go to sleep. All right. Thanks. You're sure you can handle it? Of course I can. I'll go to sleep, then. I'm much obliged. If he wets his diaper, use one of the soft ones in here. This time I'll really go to sleep. Now I can sleep all night and not worry about a thing. What a blessing! I don't believe you. You better go to sleep this time. I'll do that. Sleep until morning. There you are, dear! Thieving woman! Tell him, dear. Look, I've got a fine husband. And I have this cute little baby. Why would I need to steal? Masseur, are you her husband? What's the matter, dear? Are you too scared of the samurai to tell him the truth? Sometimes you can be so irritating! Look, if you don't believe me, then strip me and search me. But I'm warning you. When your search comes up empty... Hold on just a second. Excuse me, but is this the wallet you're looking for? You bitch! Out of the way! I'll teach her a lesson! Just a moment, sir. Since you got your wallet back, - perhaps you could let it go. - Never! Surely there's no need to be so harsh. Enough! The thing is, this woman's my wife. If I suddenly lose my wife, I won't be able to take care of the child. Please forgive her. Being married to a woman with such bad habits will mean no end of trouble for you. Step aside and I'll kill her for you. If that's how it must be, then please kill us all. Gladly. Before you do it, though, could I perhaps trouble you for a piece of paper? A piece of paper? What for? Please write our posthumous names on those three slips of paper and take them to a nearby temple. Lady, you're a blight on your husband's name. A woman with such a remarkable swordsman for a husband would do well to behave accordingly. Understand? Go jump in a lake. Thanks. Sorry to put you on the spot like that. Wait. Perhaps... Perhaps you'd like to buy a little something to eat with this. I don't need that. But you're out of money, right? It must be tough on you, having to take care of that baby all by yourself. To repay you for coming to my rescue, shall I look after the baby for you? You? Come on. Take me with you. You're so cute. Take me with you, okay? No offense, but you're blind. I can be a big help. Thank you. It's a very kind offer. By the way, how much would you charge per day? You don't need to pay me. After all, you saved my life. That wouldn't do. You can't work for free. I need to pay you something. I know. How about one ryo per day? What kind of woman do you take me for? I'm not some moneygrubbing whore. I know that perfectly well. But if instead of taking pay, you decided to take my purse, I'd be in a real stew. I wouldn't do that. So it'll be one ryo then? All right. One ryo it is. Hear that, kid? We got you a nanny for one ryo. Much obliged, miss. Right this way, sir. Blind men's pilgrimage. Hello there. I'd like to thank you again for your help the other day. When we tricked those samurai! What are you doing out here? Do you have a little one with you? My, my. And your wife too? Sounds like you're having a nice family trip. Are you folks on your way out, then? Yes. Well, we must be going. Perhaps we'll meet again sometime. That would be nice. Good-bye. Please go in good health. Keep well. This way, please. "Nightingale Whistles" Listen to this, little boy. It's a nightingale. What's the big idea? I make my living with this hand. That's exactly why I slapped it. I thought you could use a wake-up call. How I make my living is none of your business. Besides, I was only thinking of the baby. I only borrowed the whistle to make him happy. That's where you've got it wrong. The boy's not going to be happy that you borrowed something without asking. It's only a little whistle, for heaven's sake. You know, I've held my tongue until now, but you're determined to find fault with everything I do, aren't you? I wash his diapers, and you wash them a second time. First I don't feed him right. Then I don't hold him right. You're missing the point. Because you don't know how to wash his diapers or hold him, I'm trying to help you learn. I see. I get the point. If you're just going to make fun of me, I've had enough. I quit as of right now. Go find a better nanny. Is that right? You quit? Fine. Go ahead and quit. It saves me what I was going to pay you. You're disgusting. Here you go. Here's your toy. Hey, he wants to pee. Take care of him yourself. He says he wants to pee. He wants you to take him. Is it raining? Damn it! Get down here, you bitch! I'm terribly sorry. You're looking at sumo wrestlers from Ekoin Temple. There's no excuse for letting your baby pee on our heads. What shall we do? I'll take care of this. You stay here. Please hold on a second. Where's your wife? We can't settle this without your wife. A wife's offense is also her husband's, so... I'm telling you to get your wife down here! Please take pity on a blind man and allow me to make it up to you with a massage. Massage? By the time we're done massaging you, sparks will be flying from those plugs you have for eyes. You guys certainly are strong. Did you want to get in a few more licks? Pardon the intrusion, but we have a prior claim on this man. We ask you to turn him over to us. I wanted to wring his neck myself, but fine. He's all yours. Ichi. Say your prayers. Master Ichi. Master Ichi! What's keeping her? How far did she have to go? What could she be doing? She sure is taking her time. Just a little longer, kid. You'll get your milk any minute now. Tell you what. You can nurse on me until the real stuff comes. Here we go. Here we are. I have your milk. He's asleep. He's so cute. I've made up my mind. I'm never going to snatch purses again. I really mean it, Master Ichi. Watching him sleep so peacefully makes me feel ashamed. That's good. I'm glad to hear it. Please forgive me for what I said this morning. There, I've said it. I feel so much better. Master Ichi, I want you to slap this hand really hard. All right. Here goes. Really hard. "Miyagi Village" Well, here we are in Miyagi. We'll have to say good-bye to the boy. Yeah, we finally made it. Sure takes a load off my mind. Once I've turned the baby over to his father, I'm completely through with him. Since the boy's mother was killed in my place, I felt I owed it to him to bring him home, but I've had my fill of looking after a baby. Nothing demands more attention than a baby. Every time you turn around, he's bawling about something. You stick your hand in to check his diaper, and it turns out to be sopping wet. Say, that reminds me. I wanted to buy a new kimono for the boy. He's not dressed particularly well, right? Here's some money. Go get him something better. One ryo. Spend it all. Buy him something nice. Can't we wait until tomorrow to give the baby up? - Just one more day? - What are you talking about? I told you I don't like babies. I only took care of him because I felt a responsibility. I want him off my hands, the sooner the better. We're turning him over to his father today. So take this and go buy him some new clothes. - I don't want to. - No objections. Hurry up and go. I'll go with you. - I don't want to go. - Hurry up and get out of here. Please, just one more day. I said hurry up and go. Go! Sorry, son. All those things I said just now, they were all lies. The truth is I really don't want to give you up. Ever. But I have to take you to your daddy. I'm sure he'll take even better care of you than I did. You grow up to be a good boy, you hear? Grow up to be a good boy. Because of my eyes, I won't be able to remember your face. So you'll have to remember mine instead. This... This is my nose. This is my mouth. And these... These I don't have. You got all that? Good. All right, then. Time for a little nap. After you have a little nap, it'll be time to say good-bye. On the hill over yon A cripple walks by His hat bobs into sight Then bobs out of sight again What's the matter, child Why do you cry so I got the kimono. Already? That was awfully quick. You were the one who told me to hurry. Here, have a look. It's a really nice one. Good enough for the heir to a fief. You're right. I can be proud to take him to his father in this. Put it on. Put it on him. Look at you! All decked out in your fancy new clothes. What are you doing? Why are you putting on your travel clothes? Aren't we staying in Miyagi tonight? I need to thank you for all your help. Here. This is your pay. And this is a little extra something. I don't want any money. It's a token of my appreciation. I want you to have it. Master Ichi. You should know better than anyone what I'm going through right now. You take care of yourself. Perhaps we'll meet again sometime. - Come here, son. - No! Don't be that way. I hired you to come with me only this far. Master Ichi! You're so heartless. How can you be so cold when you know how I feel about you? You don't understand. It's no good for us to stay together any longer. Why not? I'm blind and I'm a drifter. I promise I won't be a burden to you. I can earn my own keep. Hold on a second. I thought you were going straight. If you don't live a clean life, you'll be an embarrassment to this child. You and I, we'll both treasure our memories of this child all our lives, but it's for the best that we go our separate ways. Take care. Hello. Excuse me. Is this the residence of Master Unosuke? What is it? What do you want? Hey, where do you think you're going? I'd like to see Master Unosuke. What's your business? It's a little complicated, and I need to speak with him directly. I take care of all the boss's business, so you can tell me what it is. You called him "the boss"just now. Yeah? So? - Hey, Hyaku. - Yes, sir. I'm going out for a bit. Please take care, sir. Excuse me, are you Master Unosuke? Who are you? You're the Master Unosuke who used to be a cocoon broker? Yes, I was a cocoon broker once. So you were. Excellent. Actually, I'm here about your wife, Toyo. About Toyo? Your wife was working at an inn in Nirazakizai to pay off some money you borrowed. Where did you hear that? Perhaps you could sit down a minute. I have something I need to show you. It won't take long. Here they are. This one is your wife's travel pass. And this one is the promissory note you wrote. Your wife worked to repay that debt. She had just finished paying it off and had started on her journey home, when, due to an unfortunate mistake, she was killed. When she died, this child was in her arms, and she was trying desperately to protect him. Master Unosuke, this is your son. Don't be ridiculous. I sit here listening patiently, and all you do is spout nonsense. I don't know any woman named Toyo. I've never been married. There's no way this child could be mine. Oh, I get it. Some village whore asked you to come here with this story and hit me up for support. Is that it? Not at all, sir. What a terrible thing to say. Hyaku, throw this man out. On your feet! Please don't be so rough on a poor blind man. I'll only take another minute. I have one more thing to give him. I brought this for you. It's a lock of your wife's hair. Take a look at this baby. What do you think, everyone? Doesn't this baby look a lot like Master Unosuke? Blind fool! You seem to have a problem with your ears as well as your eyes. I told you I've never had a wife or a kid. My wedding is coming up soon, and my bride-to-be is the daughter of a big boss around these parts. You got that? I think I do, yes. I could never turn this boy over to a man like you. I won't turn him over. I'll raise him myself. I'll raise him to be a fine young man, for Toyo's sake. I take it you have no objections? You're a really odd one, blind man. The kid is yours. Do whatever you want with him. Get out of here! Let's go, son. Toss some salt around. Master Ichi. - Miss Ko? - Why do you still have the baby? Didn't you find the man named Unosuke? He's no man. He's a beast. No, he's worse than a beast. When the bastard left his wife behind as collateral for the loan, it was actually his way of getting rid of her. Poor woman. But that's all right, don't you think? Now you and I can raise the boy. We can consider him a gift from heaven. You've been drinking, haven't you? Yeah, I've been drinking. I was so lonely, I couldn't stand it. So I had a little to drink. But I really mean it about raising the boy. Really mean it? Then stop following me around. All right. But, Master Ichi, what are you going to do now? The first thing I have to do is take this lock of his mother's hair to the local temple. I had no idea he was the one called Zatoichi. He's really that good with the sword? Yeah. I know how fearsome he is, but I also know his weakness. This time he'll go down in defeat. For the sake of my fallen comrades, I can't let him keep swaggering around. Besides, I have my pride. If you help me get him, your name will spread in no time, and you'll soon be the most powerful boss around. What do you say? That certainly sounds good, but what will our strategy be? A blind man's weakness is in his ears. Confuse his sense of hearing, and he'll be ours. "For the Repose ofToyo's Soul" Don't worry about the spill. Let me feed him. You managed to bring such a tiny baby all this way. You've done a very good turn. Here, son. The monk is going to feed you. Thanks so much. You really dote on this baby, don't you? Well, ever since I've had this child, I've felt happier than I've ever felt before. I'd do absolutely anything for this child, Monk. Yes, I'm quite sure you would. Let me suggest, then, that I take the child. Leave the child here with me. You must be joking, Monk. I already decided I would raise this child myself, whatever it takes. I wish you wouldn't kid around like that. Do you really think you can do it? - You don't think I can? - That's right. You're blind and unmarried. On top of that, you're a gangster and a drifter. You go from one journey to another living dangerously in the gleam of an unsheathed sword. Living with a man like that, how long do you think this child would survive? And suppose he did survive. Do you want him to grow up to be a gangster and a drifter like yourself? You may think I'm being harsh, but it's the best thing for the child. If you really love him, leave him with me. Monk! You must come! One of boss Unosuke's men came to demand Zatoichi. They're waiting for him behind the graveyard, and if he doesn't come, they're going to burn the temple down. All right. I'll be there in a minute. I'll hide you. Come with me. Monk. You're giving me the child? Please teach him to read and write, and raise him to be a good man. Wait. Where are you going? Unosuke is that baby's father. We'll resolve this one way or another. Oh, one other thing. Good-bye. Master Unosuke. I had a feeling you wouldn't be alone. Ichi. As we agreed, I'm here to take your head. Look here, Unosuke. I'm going to ask you just one more time. You're sure that child isn't yours? Fall back! Fall back! I admit I was lying. You're right. The child is mine. Toyo was my wife. I knew about the boy from a letter Toyo sent me. I won't trouble you with him anymore. I'll take him back and raise him up to be a man. I swear I will. So please don't kill me. I beg you. Really, I swear, Master Ichi. I beg you. What's the matter, child Why do you cry so Have Mother's breasts run dry Or has she passed away blind men's pilgrimage. Blind men's pilgrimage. THE END ?1964 DAI El CO. LTD.
