(waves crashing) (gun firing) (Cheyenne screams) (horse whinnying) (dramatic orchestral music) (suspenseful music) - I'm gonna see if I can rustle up some grub. (suspenseful music) - Hey, got something for ya! - What? - Trouble's over here, Axel! (suspenseful music) He's the one I want. The rest of you stand clear. (suspenseful music) (guns firing) Jesus! (guns firing) (suspenseful music) Won't do you any good, Axel! I'll give you my standard speech. I'm a bounty hunter, I gotcha. Now, the fact that my job requires I take the occasional human life makes me cry like a baby. I do not like bringing a man in dead, but I'll take it over nothing every time. (suspenseful music) (Axel grunting) (fists thudding) (men grunting) (Axel laughs) (fists thudding) (suspenseful music) You son of a bitch. (fists thudding) (suspenseful music) (Jeremiah gasping) (suspenseful music) No! (suspenseful music) (gun firing) Damn it! (mellow music) (dramatic orchestral music) Giddy-up, giddy-up, giddy-up! Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa. (body thuds) There you go. - Looks like your a little late if you ask me. - He's alive. (Axel groaning) Look, still breathing, see that? - He ain't breathing. Dead as a doornail (chuckles). Axel Maxwell, huh? - [Jeremiah] Mm hmm. - Well, bring him in dead, he's worth $75.00. - He was alive when I handed him over to ya. - Ah, you take it or leave it, you know. - I'm disappointed, Marshall. - (chuckles) Well, that's understandable. Why don't you file a complaint? Thing is, that complaint comes right to me, and I've already made my decision. I'll tell you what though. I will give you 15 for that horse. - 20, that's a good saddle. - Done. Now, I'll give you an extra five, you put him under the ground. - (chuckles) 10 if I put him under, five if you help me. (Marshall chuckles) And you can buy me a drink. (Marshall laughs) - Yes, indeed. Now, I'm gonna run down there. I'm gonna water your horse. You go down the street. I'll meet you in the boneyard, all right? - All right. (whimsical guitar music) Who are those boys? I saw the at your office. - They're just a couple of Captain Starrett's men biding their time, waiting for some tracker. (shovel thuds) Where the hell you going? We ain't got all day. - You work for Starrett? - Your name Haddox? - Hell no. - Didn't think so. - Garrison Haddox, the tracker? Looks like Starrett sent for Garrison Haddox. - Yeah, probably something to do with his wife. It's a young woman, quite a looker, if you ask me. Starrett claims that she killed a young cowboy over at the house, and then she killed the foreman, Sanchez, and she run off (chuckles). - Yeah, but there's gotta be a handsome fee involved, if a tracker the caliber of Haddox has been sent for. - You know him? - Heard the name. - Who the hell are you burying now? - Axel Maxwell. - Old Axel, what happened to him? I just sent him off on a job. - This fella shot him. - Shouldn't he be swinging on a rope? (dramatic music) - Yeah, well, that's up to you. He ain't nothing to me. - And a complete stranger to me, so hang him. - Now, hold on a second. There was a bounty on old Axel's head. Tell him, Marshall. - [Starrett] I didn't offer it. - Yeah well, the Marshall here sure did pay it. Speak up, Marshall. - Just ease on out, son. - You'd be Starrett? - You'd be a murdering sack of shit, horse thief? So, what happened, Frank? He killed old Axel over a horse? - Well, the Marshall here owns that horse. - The way I see it, old Axel knew you'd stolen one of my horses. - You're (whistles)? (horse whinnies) Now you tell me that's not my horse? - Now, you tell me that's not my brand. (whimsical music) - That's a delicate animal. - How are you fixed for rope, Frank? - I got a fair supply. - Even if they holler, shoot, or slap you on the ass, you stay right here. - Don't think of it as the end of your life, think of it as the beginning of your death. Let's get on with it. - [Jeremiah] You don't wanna hang me, Captain Starrett. - I don't (chuckles)? Why don't you tell me why I shouldn't? I've had a pretty shitty week, and I could use a good laugh. - Because I'm a good tracker, and I hear you're looking for one. Something to do with your wife? - That's the very job the Captain sent Axel on. - Now, you didn't become one of the biggest ranchers in these parts by being stupid. Now, you knew Axel, you know he wasn't easy to track. I brought him in. - Well, I want my wife brought in alive. - I can bring him back alive. - You can't prove that by me. - What's the pay? - The pay is you don't get hung. - (chuckles) Well, no offense Captain, but I'd be a damn fool to agree to a thing like that. In fact, you're a damn fool for offering it. You see, if I was to agree to a thing like that, you'd cut me down, I'd ride off, and you'd never see me again. - You want me to hang ya? - Might as well. Save us both a lot of aggravation. See, I take a lot of pride in my work. I demand a certain recompense. - All right, you bring my wife back here alive, I'll pay you a thousand dollars. - A thousand, a thousand. Well, that would uh, give me a reason to come back, but then again, you know, this doesn't sound like my kinda job after all. - What the hell do you mean by that? - Well, you know, bringing back a woman and all, I don't usually-- - Hang him. - All right, all right. I guess for now I'll just to assume that uh, any man who can get a U.S. Marshall to do his lynching for him, can come up with a thousand dollars. (Foley scoffs) - Go ahead, cut him down. Are you familiar with this territory, so I don't have to school you on it? - Yes, sir. - In three days, I want you to meet me at the abandoned Vendabull Mine. Now, when you talk to my wife, don't believe a thing she says. She's a born liar, but I have got to get that woman back. Do you understand what I mean when I say that? I have got to get that woman back. - Yeah. - Good luck, stranger. (whimsical music) (dramatic orchestral music) (Cheyenne grunts) (Cheyenne breathing heavily) (dramatic orchestral music) (gun thudding) (dramatic orchestral music) - (clears throat) Well, well, well. (can thuds) (chuckles) You ain't got no bullets in that gun, darling. - Sure as hell one in the breech. - I doubt it. - Find out for sure. - Well hell, you can only get one of us, and you probably gonna miss. - Not at this range. (fist thuds) (Cheyenne grunts) - Well, looky here, still cocked. Why don't we see if it's loaded. (gun clicks) Ah, your lucky day. Let's take a look at them titties. (foot thuds) (man grunts) Get her, get her! Put her on the table, God! - Hey, you boys better let her up. Right now, nice and easy. Let's go! (guns firing) (Jeremiah whistles) (horse whinnies) (gun firing) (hooves thudding) (gun firing) - Ya! (whimsical harmonica music) - [Starrett] Is that one yours? - That's the Razor. He's the reason why I'm so good. - Why you calling him Razor? (Haddox chuckles) - Foley, give the man his money. (whimsical harmonica music) - 250, the wire said 500. - Double your pay when you're done. There's a man ahead of you, a bounty hunter. - Want a drink? - I always bring 'em in dead. - I want her brought in alive. - Cost you 250 extra. - That'll be fine. - Get up, you're not particularly the grateful type, are you? - Yeah, well, get used to it. - You rather socialize with them? (gun firing) - Twins on a horse, they'll catch us. - You think I don't know that? - Well, just let me go. I'll take my chances. - Hey ya! (dramatic orchestral music) (guns firing) (dramatic orchestral music) Tuck in behind that rock and don't you go anywhere. (guns firing) You behind the rock, run or die. Most wouldn't give you a choice. (guns firing) - Get over there. (guns firing) (dramatic music) (Cheyenne grunts) - You took my knife. - You're not particularly the grateful type, are ya? - You keep your hands off my weapons. I'll give you my standard speech. - Must you? - I'm a bounty hunter, I gotcha, and the fact that my job requires I take the occasional human life, makes me cry like a baby. I do not like bringing a man or a woman in dead. - You won't get your money if you do. - I gotta do something about that standard speech. It's not going over at all lately. - I already know my husband ordered you to bring me back alive. - No, you don't. - Oh, yes, I do. - You did shoot the man. How do you know he doesn't want you-- - Because I know more than you do, Mr. Bounty Hunter. - Yeah, well, I'm taking you back. They'll probably hang you for murder. - It was all self-defense. - Oh, well, what about that kid? They say he didn't even have his boots on. - So, I wouldn't be very likely to shoot him now, would I? What're you doing? - I'm gonna bury them. - What for? - They're dead. - Well, they weren't exactly preachers. (whimsical orchestral music) Wow, two scraps. (birds chirping) How much is he paying you? - I'm eating. - I wanna wash up. - [Jeremiah] No time. - You got time to sit there scratching your ass, I'd like to clean myself right now. - [Jeremiah] Stay where I can see you. Toss those boots over here. - What for? - No boots, no bath. - This ain't a peep show. (mellow music) The woods have eyes around here. (rock thuds) (Jeremiah grunts) (dramatic music) (Jeremiah whistles) (horse whinnies) - He'll just ride off with anybody. Stay here. Did you learn the way it is? You are not going anywhere, not without me taking you there. - I twisted my ankle. - Yeah, well, I'll untwist it later. - Do I look like a sack of potatoes to you? - Sometimes. (dramatic orchestral music) - Whoa, bounty hunter's got her. - Whoa, whoa, let me have some water. I know you've been waiting. - I already had it. You know, you oughta let somebody clean that. - Yeah, somebody without claws. Come on, boy. - How much is he paying you? - You asked me that already. - How much? - Plenty. - He hasn't given you the first dollar, has he? You're doing this purely on trust. - Not trust, hunger. - Listen, cowboy, what's he promised you, 2,000? I've got 20, $20,000.00, 21,563 to be exact. (dramatic music) - Starrett told me you're full of lies. - It's Starrett's money, which he got by peddling stolen guns, so it's dirty money. Anybody's for the taking. He told you he wanted me brought back alive, didn't he? - Yeah, now why is that? - Well, why else would he do it, except he wants his money back? - Oh uh, he's gonna send me after you when you got all his money? - He knew I'd hide it, because that's what he'd do. - When he's not busy running guns. - Steals them from the Army, and sells them to anybody with cash. - Nah, I heard he used to be an army man. He had a good name at one time. - Yeah, he's got this officer friend, and they skim from shipments, and they make one hell of a tidy profit. - (chuckles) Yeah well, 20,000 is right tidy. - Yes, it is. - Where'd you put it? - Buried it. - Where? - Nobody knows, but me. - When I was tracking you all that way, I didn't see any signs of any digging. - Then you're not much of a tracker, are ya? - Oh, I see, I'm supposed to just ah, doubt the very instincts that got me this far, and take your word for it? Give up Starrett's hard earned coin in favor of you. - How's he gonna pay ya? He's got nothing to pay ya with. You know what he's gonna do when you turn me over to him. He's gonna call you a horse thief, or some kind of crazy killer. - [Jeremiah] And hang me. - Think he won't? - That's not what I was thinking, no. - I don't see a thing. - Well, I guess that doesn't make you much of a tracker now, does it? I'll tell you one thing, you're one hell of a yacker. - [Cheyenne] What did you see? - There's two of them. - Got any idea who they are? - I got my suspicions. You got a price on your head, Mrs. Starrett. (dramatic orchestral music) - Whatcha see? Yeah, I saw it that time too. He's trying to pick us off. It's about a thousand yards. You think he's got the talent? (gun firing) He can't hit a target that moves once he's fired. (gun firing) (horse whinnying) (whimsical harmonica music) (Haddox scoffs) (whimsical harmonica music) Razor! Razor! - So, you took all his money? - Sure did. - So why didn't he send his men after you? - Needs them, he's got a delivery to make, a shipment of arms for a desperado in Chihuahua. - So you picked a good time. You'll be looking for a good time to shoot me. - I'll be finding it. (crickets chirping) Suppose I gotta sleep like this? - I'm the one that's gotta sleep. - Lay one paw on me, I'll knock the living shit outta you. - You just rate yourself irresistible now, do ya? - Listen, cowboy, what's your name? - That's the name, A cowboy. - Let me tell you something. You don't trust a man like Felton Starrett. The man's ruthless. He killed that boy without even batting an eye. He stood there and he shot him dead. The sweetest kid. You're working for a gunrunner. You're working for a killer. - You're the one married him. - [Cheyenne] Yes, I should know, shouldn't I? - Was it for the money? - What? - [Jeremiah] That you married him. - He had a lot of charm once. - Oh, then it was for the charm. - It wasn't for the smell of a drunk man's breath, or the Tuesday and Thursday beatings. - He did that? He roughed you up? - [Cheyenne] What's it to you? - I'm sorry, is all. - Is that supposed to make it better? - Till you hooked up with the kid. - Lanny wanted me to run away with him. (mellow music) Can't you see you got a crying, shivering woman over here? As long as we gotta be twins, the least you could do is provide a little more heat. (mellow music) Don't you ever wanna be close to somebody? - It comes and goes. (mellow music) (crickets chirping) - I thought you'd run away. - What's your name, cowboy? - Jeremiah. - Call me Cheyenne. (dramatic music) Jeremiah. - You lost me my best animal. Empty it, you, the wife, get over here. - We can work this out, Haddox. - [Haddox] Nothing to work out, toss it. (dramatic music) - You trying to take me back to my husband too? - Woman, I'm doing it. Get over here now! Get over here! - You know, I can pay you more than he can. I took all his money. I'll split it with you if you let me go, but you'll have to kill him first. He knows about it. - I should kill him anyway. - She's a born liar. She was telling me the same thing. (Cheyenne crying) (fist thuds) - Woman! (gun firing) (fists thudding) (Jeremiah grunting) (dramatic music) (pan thuds) (dramatic music) - [Jeremiah] Let's get outta here. (dramatic music) (gun firing) (dramatic music) - Whoa, little friend. Have a drink of this. (whimsical harmonica music) Nah, don't worry about them. They won't get far. They're on foot. We'll run them down. Look, I'm staying with you, all right. All right, buddy, just hang in there. I'm gonna get started on poultice. Be right back. - (gasping) God. Son of a bitch. - Here. - [Jeremiah] They must've walked all night. - Let me take a look. - No, no, we gotta go, come on. (dramatic music) - Capitan! - [Starrett] You're late, Vargas. - It's a long way from Chihuahua, senor. (speaking in foreign language) It looks like a bad one, senor. Who did it? - That's none of your business. Throw him a rifle, Foley. - I heard you had a run in with the wife. Pretty smooth. (speaking in foreign language) Why did she shoot you? Perhaps she's not getting enough at home. - Do you like the rifle? - Uh huh, si. - Then pay me. (speaking in foreign language) What's this? - That's all I brought. - God damn it. (speaking in foreign language) I was expecting $12,000.00. - You're gonna get it, but not today. What's your hurry? I've always paid you. - This will buy you five rifles, and that's it. Count out five rifles. - No, no, no, no, amigo, no. I'll tell you what we'll do. I'll take the rifles, all of the rifles. I'll bring you the money at the end of the month. - That isn't gonna work, amigo. - I'm afraid that I must insist. (dramatic music) (guns firing) (dramatic music) (wind whooshing) (whimsical orchestral music) - All right, we'll stay in here for awhile, get some rest. We'll start off again at sundown. - [Cheyenne] Ow. - No, don't touch it. - It's gotta be cleaned. - My mouth feels like I'm growing cotton. - [Cheyenne] Hold still. - You might be a little easier. You better kill him first? He knows about it? - Hell, it worked. - Yeah, well, it could've gone the other way. - Yeah, I was willing to take that chance. - You sure were. - Went clean through. Might've nicked the bone a little bit. (McGovern moaning) - Who's that moaning? (McGovern moaning) - That's McGovern, he won't last long. - And Ramirez? - He's dead, hanged him two vaqueros. - How're you doing? - We came out pretty good, Captain. I always make it. I ain't so big a target. Maybe you oughta hire a bunch of short guys. - (chuckles) Could be, they eat less too. - Capitan, you put a hole in me. What're you gonna do now, huh? Capitan, pretty sky, huh? Maybe it'll be the last sundown for some of us. (light piano music) - What do ya got billy goat in your blood? What're you doing over here? - You gonna go ahead and agree to help me, or do I still have to kill ya? - We better get moving, come on. (light piano music) - If I give you half the money, will you let me go? - Why don't we speak on that subject while I'm looking at the money? - Then when you're looking at the money, we'll have a deal? - No deal. - Why not? - Because even if I'm looking at the money, I'm not letting you go. - You're taking me back to Starrett? - No. I mean I'm never letting you go. (mellow music) - I'm gonna die soon enough, amigo. I'll be waiting for you. (gun firing) - [Cheyenne] What if it's Haddox? - No, it couldn't be. They're behind us. Let me have the canteen. Here. Here. - [Haddox] Whoa, whoa, whoa. - Foley, come on. Come on, give me a hand. - What're you doing? (dramatic music) - Let's get the others. - You gonna throw them all down there, McGovern and Ramirez too? Captain, these are our men. Why are we doing this? - Because I need to clear out this area. - He's alive, Captain. (dramatic music) Listen, Captain, I'm finished here. How about you give me my pay now? - I haven't got it to give. - I don't want it all. I just want what's mine. Now, lay it out there for me nice and easy. - Foley, I'm gonna have to kick your ass for this. - How, you're practically down to one leg. - All right, you're right. (dramatic music) (gun firing) Whatcha do that for, Foley? I really liked you. (dramatic music) - The woman's been conjugating with him, but not more than a few hours ago. I don't like it. I don't like it. Let's go, come here. - Coming into camp, mister. - You got any water? - Yeah. - Hand it over then before I shoot you dead. - Glad to, I'm gonna have to be asking you. - Ah, hell, not you. - You were with Axel. - You uh, you gonna give me water or kill me, or give me water and then kill me? - I'm not gonna shoot ya. I'm tired of killing people. - How about you just give me some water then? Ah, don't, don't, don't, don't be spilling any of it now. - I'm gonna have to be asking you for your horse. - My horse, ha, ha! You and that horse both tried to kill me. You belong together. - [Jeremiah] Valdosa is about 10 miles south of here. Whoa, you have a good life. - Too late. (dramatic orchestral music) - [Cheyenne] It's not far. - [Jeremiah] You sure? - [Cheyenne] Yep. - Yeah, well, we'll see about that. (dramatic orchestral music) Whoa. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I'll take care of that. (Jeremiah chuckling) - You believe me now? Let's head to New Orleans. - No, not with tainted money. - Oh, please, I know how particular a bounty hunter can get about where he gets his money (chuckles). (whimsical orchestral music) Whoa (laughing)! - I'd never do that to a horse. (dramatic orchestral music) Jesus, hang on! Ya ya, come on, come on, boy, hey ya! Hey ya, come on, come on! (dramatic orchestral music) Hey ya, come on, come on, come on! - [Haddox] Whoa, whoa, whoa! (Jeremiah grunts) (dramatic orchestral music) (gun firing) - Jeremiah! Jeremiah! - So long, bounty man. - Throw me the rope, Haddox. - Well, help him up. - Can't do it. We got a collection to make, come on. - Throw me a rope, Haddox! - You find his horse? - You can't leave him like that. - Would you rather I kill him? - No. - Why, Mrs. Starrett, shame, shame, shame. Let's go, boy. (Jeremiah grunts) (Jeremiah screaming) (dramatic orchestral music) (Jeremiah whistles) (horse whinnies) - If I had a single brain in my whole God damn head, I'd forget this whole damn mess. I know what you're thinking. - [Cheyenne] Mr. Haddox. - This is time I set aside for the blessed scriptures. - [Cheyenne] May I ask you a question? - I do not answer questions now, I study. - I just wondered how you this here Mr. Razor ever got together in the first place. - (laughing) We met at a funeral. (Razor chuckling) (Haddox laughing) - Nevermind, I just want you to know the offer's still good. I've got the money. - [Haddox] Ha, she's got the money. (dramatic orchestral music) Whoa. - Haddox. - You come alone? You got a hole in your hat. - Yes, I do. Cheyenne, it's good to see you again. - I brought your wife back alive. - [Starrett] Yes, you did. - Well, I recall there was a pledge to double my pay. - Was. - That's $1,000.00 on delivery. - Reverend, I haven't got a thousand dollars to give you. I'm sorry. You tell that Indian to bring my wife over here right now. - It would be so much easier on you just to pay me, and cheaper too. I told him to kill her if I had any trouble, and I call this trouble. - Hey you, put that gun down. Put that gun down! Haddox, tell your man to put the gun down. Does he speak English? - Depends on who's talking. - Well, talk to him, God damn it! (gun firing) (dramatic orchestral music) (guns firing) - I'll give you my standard speech! (guns firing) Maybe not. (guns firing) - Ho, ho. (guns firing) (Jeremiah whistles) (horse whinnies) You thought I was dead, didn't ya? (guns firing) You okay? - No, grab the horse, come on. - Good idea. (guns firing) Starrett! Not that you'd give me one! I'm gonna give you a chance! Now, come out and face me! Stand down, Haddox, I got my own business to settle. - Hold it, Razor, Razor. Let them shoot it out. - You didn't plan on paying me, did ya? - I did. - Uh huh. I don't like the way you treat Cheyenne. - Oh, and since when did that become your business? - You know, my reasons for killing you and stealing your wife are piling up pretty tall. - I think I'll pay ya right now. (dramatic orchestral music) (guns firing) And here's payment in full. - [Cheyenne] Felton. - [Starrett] What? - [Cheyenne] Honey. - What? - I know I did things to you. - And now you think I might be roped off about that, do ya? - I just don't think you're gonna wanna kill him just yet. - Kill him, you're afraid I'm gonna kill him? After what you did in my bed with my God damn ranch hand? - I didn't think you'd care. - What, what's wrong with you, woman? - You never had time for me. You're always running off with whores. How is that different from what I did? - Wasn't I good to you? Didn't I always give you whatever you wanted? - Everything except a life. - Damn you, woman. You put a hole in my leg, you steal everything I own, and then when I get you dragged back here, you make it seem like I had wronged you. Isn't there a limit to your mendacity? - I'm sorry, I'm sorry I caused you so much trouble. Maybe I should just go off somewhere. - Now, don't do that. May God help me, but I don't care that you shot me in the leg, because my leg is gonna heal, but making me spend all those lonely nights without you. I couldn't stand that, and what did I do to deserve it, tell me. - I guess I'm just still a little wild. I can do better. - You mean you wanna come back to me? - If you'll have me. - I tell you what, you tell me where my money is, and I'll forget this ever happened. - He stole it off me. - He did? - [Cheyenne] Yeah. - He stole it off of you? - Uh huh, he took it and he hid it somewhere. I don't know where, but he sure does. - Mister, I'm gonna start shooting up your feet, and then I'm gonna work my way up from there, and some point, I guarantee you, you're gonna wanna tell me where my money is. - Okay, okay, I believe ya. You ride out about a day's ride here to Valdosa. - [Starrett] What? - I, I, I mean, we ride out. We'll come to this big cottonwood tree. It stands about head taller than all the rest. - [Cheyenne] No! (dramatic orchestral music) (gun firing) (Starrett grunts) (dramatic orchestral music) - [Haddox] Nice work, bounty man. - It's over, Haddox. - Yeah, I know, but I'd feel better if you just put that away. I didn't like you running off my animal. - Yeah, well. - I expect this will just about cover my time and trouble. How much went down that hole? - [Jeremiah] Oh, about as much as you got. - You gonna try and fetch it out? - Woman, you got to be crazier than a dog humping on a rattlesnake. You'll get yourself crushed, maybe even drowned. Razor, you come up with anything? - Don't even think about taking my horse. - Well, the good Lord giveth, and he taketh away. I'll let it go this time. I expect we'll be leaving, Razor, Jeremiah. - Haddox. (dramatic music) (Jeremiah groaning) - It's not so big. - I hate the part where you look at me and say he did it when everybody's got their guns out. - Well, it worked both times. - Well, the second time almost didn't. - I knew I could count on you. - What're you doing? - Well, here's the shipment. Money's gotta be around here somewhere. Well, the rifles oughta be worth something, huh? - We are taking these back to the U.S. Army. - Ha, look, we don't have to take this back now, do we? - I suppose not. - Good. Hey, one more thing. - You are out of your wits if you think I am going down that hole. - Jeremiah. - Is money all you care about? Excuse me. (Jeremiah grunting) God, I hate snakes. (gun clicking) (dramatic music) - Put the money on the ground. - I always did wanna die stupid. - Put your hands up! Now, kick the money back down the shaft. - What? - You're wrong, money is not all I care about, and I'm gonna prove it to you. Now, kick it back down there! - Now, just hold on a minute. You made me crawl down that shaft with my shoulder burning like a thousand bastards, so I can come back up here, and kick that money back down in that shaft? You wanna prove something?
