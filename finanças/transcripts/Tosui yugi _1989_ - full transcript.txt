Mr. Hirano, what happened? Ouch! Senior manager, it's empty. Hey, get another one. Hurry up! Just because of an insect, we can't even go out for lunch. Sorry. Here it is. ldiot! You do it! You are appointed. Do hurry! Hey, Mr. Hirano! Hurry up! - Hurry up! - Yeah. Can't you tell the difference between an insecticide and spray paint? You - we are in the office. Please refrain from speaking roughly. Senior manager, are you alright? Ouch! Ouch! Stop it! Senior manager, this is too much! Hey! l have good information about fashion. lf you answer our questionnaire... Special discounted overseas travel too! You! Stupid! What? You're stupid too! Hey! You are Shirakawa. You are Nakata? Did you have a fight or something? Hey! Hey! l was surprised when you suddenly fell over. l had a quarrel at the office. When l saw your face, l let go of my tension. l called Takako, and we brought you here by taxi. You are heavier than l thought. lt was tough. Takako said we should call an ambulance, but l'd never heard that you had a special disease, and it was kind of embarrassing in the middle of the city. - l may have new employee's depression. - Sounds like it. Then you had a fight? - Do you want a coffee? - No, thank you. lt might warm you up. l don't like other people touching my cups and other things. Okay. l'll go home. You helped us a lot. l'll treat you sometime. l will await it without much expectation! Are you still dating that woman? ''Still''?! lt's not as long as you make out. - Why do you like her? - She's cheerful. You get tired because l am depressing? You're not especially depressing. Just normal. Doesn't ''normal'' mean ''depressing''? You are suffering from new employee's depression. You haven't come here since you started dating that woman. Not really. My work is busy. My company is not as big as yours. Besides, it's a commission-based system. Hey, are you alright? Please come visit me as often as before. Drinking alcohol or watching videos... lt was fun. We were together for three years in the fencing club in high school. We need to settle the score sometime. What? This. We graduated before we saw the results of training. Fight with real swords. Think about it. We used to use rope, didn't we? We did it often, so that we wouldn't be afraid of the point of a sword. Hello? Sorry for what happened earlier, despite you helping me. lf you say so. Treat me to dinner! l have something l want to ask you. What is it? Do you like Shirakawa? Why? l feel like you don't let me in. Not really. ls that so? That's boring. What's boring? Because l thought we were in a love triangle. Hey, senior manager... - Actually, there was no insect. - l thought so! We have to train a new employee by beating him up! - Are you sure that they went in here? - Yeah. Where is the entrance? lt's not clear. Why are you carrying around such a thing? Pervert! Ouch! How is it? You are a pig! Why does a pig speak human language? Hey... Let's do it the normal way, unlike the weirdoes next door. - Hey! - You're noisy! Hey! Hey! Let's make a triangle. Franz Kafka - The Metamorphosis Sorry for the sudden call. l'm from ldea Works company... After our legitimate raffle, you have been chosen to be... the winner of a free vacation to Hawaii. Congratulations! How come l became an insect? Even if I go to the office, only insecticide is waiting. What shall I do? Maybe l should go to the meeting that was discussed in that phone call earlier. lt's tough. ldea Works Company Hawaii Tour Prize Winner Explanation Meeting Room Water! l want to drink water! What are they doing? You are lucky to have won this Hawaii tour prize. You laugh a little now... Perhaps you think that a trip to Hawaii is out of date? You do think that! Yes, yet most people still come here, even though they thought so, too. Depending on the conditions, this could be good... that's why they come. You are afraid that you may be forced to buy something, or you may be forced to get our membership, or this may be involved with the Yakuza. Don't worry - there is nothing like that! But we are not a charitable organization, so we have to ask you some really tiny favours. All you have to do is sell two items from these pamphlets to anyone. The merchandise in our pamphlets is English conversation lesson material: high-end beauty product sets, VCRs and PCs. They are just part of some of the merchandise. Everything is very popular, best-selling merchandise. They will be definitely sold, or people would love to buy. You only need to do this, and then you can get your special Hawaii vacation... which you can't even begin to imagine while you are in Tokyo. A night with a hula girl for men and a night with a beach boy for women will be waiting there. That's something you can never buy with money. So you are involved in that type of scam business... - Anyway, l'm thirsty. Excuse me a moment. - Oh, he is senior manager! Shit! l was swallowed. Hey, you are going to sell our merchandise, aren't you? What are you? Can't breathe! Stop it... l have a wife and children. Why are you ashamed? You're always doing things like this to your wife. Experience what your wife always feels. Do insects brush their teeth? Hey... did you go to a no-tell hotel with Takako? What do you want? Say something! You! l'm not blaming you. Things can get complicated. l don't want it. You and me... me and Takako... and you and Takako. lt's a common relationship. This is not common... - l'm a man and you are a man too. Then a woman... - So? lt's common that two men love one woman, but in that case, there is no relationship between the men, if it is common. What you are telling me is... Ouch! Ouch! Wow, l want to ride it too! lt's not about that. What do you mean? Because you went to a no-tell hotel with him, things have become complicated. But we went. We can't change that fact. Get off. We went. That's all. Yes. We did nothing. What do you mean? That's all. That's all? l don't want any complications. That's boring. Getting tangled up is good. l don't care either way. Hurry up! Hey! Hey! We were in a no-tell hotel, but all he did was listen to the room next door with a bug. - Really? - Really! - lt's strange. - Yeah, strange! But l do want a love triangle after all. lf l sleep like this, will it happen again? So when it finished, did l get transferred to this guy? ldea Works Company, which has been controversial... because of their high-pressure street sales tactics, was finally targeted by a compulsory investigation, and the police confiscated the membership list. The police intend to investigate the members on the list, too. Next news... Today around 11:20 am in Ota-ku... The Trial Club Welcome. Your name, please. Masao Tachihara. Registration complete. You're late. Whom did you come to see in this club? l don't know... There was no other place to go today. This guy is a street thug who bothered me when l was on my way to school. Because of you, l couldn't concentrate, so my grades dropped. Hot! Hot! Stop it! Stop it! Ouch! What are you doing? Stop it! Please stop! Ouch! Street thug... l have been transferred to you now. You ate liver and a Chinese chive stir-fry. lt was garlic scrapes of Chinese food. lt was liver and a Chinese chive stir-fry and fried pot-stickers. Don't come here after eating such things. Leave me alone. Come after rinsing your mouth. Even from this distance, your breath smells. What? You are here, as l thought. Did you finish playing? Why do you know about this place? This place is managed by ldea Works. Now you know. You can't run away. ldea Works was investigated by the police, and it went bankrupt. Oh, you knew? Then, you know well that you don't have to sell anything anymore, that all we have to do now is shut people up who are on the membership list. - You've heard this in the explanation meeting. - But... That's okay. l'm not the executioner. Here is Momoko of S&M fame. Don't think S&M is sadomasochism. lt's an abbreviation for 'Shocking Madonna'. Holy Momoko... Don't let them go to the great beyond in a month. Slap and slap and slap them to the death. 'lt's showtime!' Stop it. Don't come. Stop it. Stop it! Help me! Help me! Stop it! Stop it! Let me go! This place seems uncomfortable. Sorry for the sudden call. l'm from ldea Works company... After our legitimate raffle, you have been chosen to be the winner of a free vacation to Hawaii. That's why we are contacting you. Both of them have been absent since yesterday... Hi! Hey! Why are you running away? Because you're chasing me! - Let's settle the score. - What? Fencing. l told you. l know a good place. Why did you scream? lt was a dream, too. Did you have a bad dream? l had a dream about waking up from a dream. What is that? Do you mean a dream you can't wake up from? Shall l make coffee? Cheer up, Japanese businessman! l became an insect. Okay. l will exterminate it! lf you are in a dream from which you can never awaken, sleeping and being awake are not different. Then, l really became an insect.
