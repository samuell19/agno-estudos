A VISITOR FROM THE LIVING I filmed A Visitor from the Living, based on my interview with Maurice Rossel in 1979, while I was filming Shoah. For reasons of structure and length, I could not treat Theresienstadt directly in my film. It's an extraordinary subject, both central and lateral to the progress and genesis of the destruction of the Jews of Europe. We know that Theresienstadt, a fortified city 50 miles northeast of Prague, was chosen by the Nazis as the site for what Adolf Eichmann himself called a model ghetto, a ghetto to be shown. Emptied of its Czech inhabitants, it received, from November 1941 to April 1945, the Jews of the Greater Germanic Reich (Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, Austria, Germany), the ones known as Prominenten, prominent members of Germany society, who hadn't managed to emigrate, or, too old to start a new life, had renounced, hoping their status would protect them. Honoured World War II veterans, renowned doctors and lawyers, high-level officials and politicians of pre-Hitler Germany, leaders of Jewish organisations, artists, intellectuals, et cetera. It was difficult to immediately submit them to the special treatment given to the Jews of Poland, the Baltic States and the Soviet Union. Theresienstadt also received, in 1943 and 1944, a small number of Jews from Denmark who hadn't managed to escape to Sweden, Jews from Holland, Luxembourg, Slovakia, Hungary, Poland and even France. The truth is that this model ghetto was a way station, either the first or last stop on the voyage to death which led most of the ones who stopped here to the gas chambers of Auschwitz, Sobibór, Bełżec or Treblinka. Living conditions in Theresienstadt were appalling. Most of the Jewish men and women concentrated there were quite elderly and rotted away due to poverty, overcrowding and malnutrition in the overpopulated barracks of the fortress. Here, like elsewhere, the Nazis tricked and stole from those they prepared to kill. The Frankfurt Gestapo offered credulous old women being sent to Theresienstadt the choice between a sunny flat and a north-facing one, demanding advance payment for these fictitious lodgings. The Jews were not the only ones fooled. The ghetto to be shown, or even Potemkin ghetto, referring to the legend of Prince Grigory Aleksandrovich Potemkin having fake villages built along the route taken by Catherine the Great, Empress of Russia, when visiting the newly-annexed territories of Ukraine and Crimea. Theresienstadt was created to be shown, and it was. As leader of an ICRC delegation, International Committee of the Red Cross, Maurice Rossel inspected the ghetto inJune 1944, with the consent of German authorities. I thank Maurice Rossel for allowing me to use today the interview we did in 1979, Now in my 80s, he wrote me, I scarcely remember the man I was back then. I think I'm wiser now, or crazier. It's the same thing. Be lenient, don't make me look too ridiculous. I did not try to. Dr. Rossel, this is what essentially interests me: To me, you're an historical figure. You held a totally strategic position - as the ICRC delegate in Germany... - That's right. During all those years. I say you're an historical figure because today there are few men like you, who did what you did, with your experience... ...who are able to testify to the climate at that time. That's what I'd like to ask about first. What was it like being an ICRC delegate... ...in wartime Germany? What year did you arrive in Berlin? - I arrived in 1942. - In '42. Actually, I didn't join the International Red Cross... ...like an evangelist out to spread the Good Word. I joined simply to escape the army. I was an officer in the Swiss army, and we were occupying the borders. It was a mind-numbing job. I was ready to do anything to get out of that idiotic job, and that's the real reason I went to work for the ICRC. They sent me to Germany because no one else would go. They were happy to hire young people. I was sent there with no training - none at all. At 25, you're not really mature. - You were 25? - Yes, I was 25, so I was still, I admit, quite naive, a real simpleton who'd come from his village to study in Geneva, who knew nothing about anything, and would learn out in the field. How many Swiss were in Berlin? There were between six and eight of us in Berlin, with a delegation leader, Monsieur Marty, a great man, absolutely charming. He was a friend of mine. We'd attended the same school, although he was older, which is why I thought of him to get me out of this military snare. He did so immediately. I called him on Thursday, and Monday night I was in Berlin. - That was quick. - Diplomatic passport and everything. Things moved fast then. Between Thursday and Monday, it was all settled. What was it like? Tell us about arriving in Berlin, your first impressions, your mission. It was to visit prisoner of war camps. A distinction must be made. Today's generation doesn't see the difference. They think POW camps and civilian prison camps were the same thing. That's absolutely false. You can never repeat it enough. The great majority of non-German POWs were treated decently. There were about six million POWs, held on average four to six years... Excuse me. Stop recording. We have to make this kid leave. Take him outside. Sorry, we can't have him coughing in here. There were six million POWs, imprisoned for four years on average, and 90% of them survived. The civilians in the camps stayed six months on average, and 90% of them died. If we don't clearly explain this huge difference up front, everything gets muddled. We see documentaries on prisoners, but you only deal with deported civilians, correct? Yes, but I'm still interested in what your job entailed. Our mission was, according to the Geneva convention, to visit POW camps. In return, other delegates visited Allied POW camps... ...where Germans were imprisoned. That's where our strength lay, not in morality or in pacts made before the war. It lay in the fact that you arrive in a fortress, they say, "He tried to escape. "He entered top-secret areas, so he's condemned to death." "Fine," I say. "Can I see him?" I tell him, "Don't worry, wait for the war to end." In my files I have 12 condemned Germans waiting for the same thing, so if they execute you, the Germans will also be executed. It's the only way to talk, and absolutely horrible when a man's life is at stake. It was bargaining, and it worked. - It worked? - It worked very well. Was it a shock to arrive in Berlin in the middle of the war? No, it wasn't a shock because ll was amongst other Swiss, with some doctors there. We were all friends. We got along well, we had the... the same mentality. - You remained among other Swiss? - Yes. Or did you have contact with Germans, the civilian population? Very little contact with the civilians, very, very little, probably because it'd be dangerous for any German to contact us. We had very few German visitors. We had visitors, but mostly Swiss. The Swiss who lived there. There was one who... - You lived at a hotel? - No, we had a house assigned to us by the Foreign Department. - You all lived together? - Yes, first at Balanstätterstrasse, then we were ausgebombt, meaning the house collapsed, and then we stayed at Wannsee, the fantastic property of Brigitte Helm, a film star of the time. It was a superb property. For us it was a little haven. - On the lake? - Exactly. We'd return to this haven between missions, and at least there we could relax and enjoy ourselves among friends. We received visitors like Ambassador Scapini. Remember him? - Yes. - He was badly wounded. He was blind. He was blind. He was a sort of ambassador for Vichy France. - He was Pétain's man. - Yes. I saw him more than once there. Always with a guy to push his wheelchair. He was a charming man. We were on extremely polite terms with people like that, - but nothing more. - Did you feel a climate of oppression? Yes. After all, Berlin... it's a big city. In a big city, you have the little people who retain their irreverence and sense of independence. It can't be quelled. For example, after a bombing raid with more than 1,000 planes over Berlin... If there were more than 1,000 planes, we got an extra coffee ration. After a bombing, people said, "Now we'll get our Zitter Kaffee. " You know, we'd be entitled to our coffee... - That's just Berlin humour. - It exists, like in every big city. How did you come to inspect what they called "civilian internment camps? The big problem with deported and interned civilians was there was no legislation, or the equivalent. Not so much the legality, but no comparable camps existed on the other side. The Germans said, "You have no rights. "We never signed any treaty authorising you "to visit deportation camps. They are enemies of Germany, even though they're not soldiers. We captured them for a different reason, not on the battlefields. This was correct. This meant that we had to work in total illegality. The ICRC, at the request of the Joint or other groups, told me, "Gather as much information "as possible. "Try to visit them, ask the Kommandantur "to take a census of the camps, "learn their locations. "But under no circumstances are you covered by the ICRC. "We have no right to send you there. "You just go there, and if you get in trouble, you're on your own. - That's not very nice. - They weren't taking risks. "We'll do the impossible, "we'll do whatever we can to save you from the Gestapo, "but you'll have acted on your own." - It was very courageous to do this. - Not really, but perhaps a bit reckless. I had my escort officer... Did they say, "We want information"? Did they mention extermination? No, I never heard the word "extermination". - It was never mentioned? - No, it wasn't. "Try to visit the camps, see all you can. "Whatever you wish. Just try not to break the law." Fortunately, we had cartons of Camel cigarettes, and even better, some nylon stockings, a little transistor if we needed it, for a very important person, because we needed a pass, or to be accompanied by one of them. It wasn't our good looks and moralising that could get us through checkpoints that no one passed. But for stockings for his sweetheart, he'd look the other way and we'd manage to reach the camp commander, like I made it to Auschwitz. That's extraordinary. You made it to Auschwitz? Yes. My escort officer was an officer of the Wehrmacht, but about 25 miles from the camp, the main camp, we were halted by the security services at a barricade. They ask him to get out. He has no authority - even as an officer decorated with the Knight's Cross - to enter a territory which is absolutely closed to the German army. As we parted, I said, "My friend, if in a while, "you still haven't seen me, I'd still like you to file your report. Goodbye." And I continued alone. But they didn't put a guard in the car. - Were you authorised for Auschwitz? - Not at all. - But they were expecting you. - Not at all. There was no authorisation. You didn't get any written authorisation. It was simply... I played the role of the simpleton, the idiot, and it worked, I made it. - Not even a phone call? - Nothing at all. - Extraordinary. - No phone call, nothing. If there had been, I'd have been turned away. Refused access. - Why did you go to Auschwitz? - I went there to see it, to see the camp commander. Geneva gave me... or rather, its Berlin representative, my friend Marty, a trump card which had no real value: I was to offer them drugs for their infirmary. We knew it was an unrealistic bluff, that they'd refuse. - In Auschwitz. - Yes. When I finally arrived at the last gate, I presented my papers and said, "I'd like to speak to the camp commander." - You arrived in Auschwitz by train? - There were no trains for me. By car. - A car? - Yes, I had a small car. I finally made it, after passing all the checkpoints. - What did you say at the checkpoints? - "I'm going to see the Kommandantur - "at Auschwitz." - With what? Just my papers as international delegate of the Red Cross. I was pretty harmless. I didn't scare them. I swear, if fear were palpable... You might try to swagger, but you weren't so sure of yourself. Especially when you're all alone. I arrived in that Kommandantur and was very politely received by the camp commander. - Remember his name? - No, but it's in the ICRC documents. - Was it Höss? - He was a young man, very elegant, with blue eyes, very distinguished, very cordial - "Please sit. May I offer you a coffee?" which I accepted. "What brings you here? It's surprising." I said, "I'm here to offer you this." "Oh, you're Swiss. "I adore Switzerland. I've been bobsleighing in Arosa. No, Davos or Saint Moritz. Bobsleighing? I don't know. He bobsleighed or wanted to show he belonged to high society that bobsledded. As a working-class lad, I'd seen bobsleighing, but never had the means to do it myself. We chatted a bit, then I said, "Here's the situation. "The ICRC would like information. Can we send something?" "I don't see why not.” Of course, it resulted in nothing. - You asked him questions? - I asked him questions. Very evasively, of course, but... What did you ask? If we might support the infirmary, and to visit it. He said, "No, they are interned. You have no right to see anything. "But if you want to send aid or drugs for the infirmary, you can." "Can we send food supplies?" "I don't see why not. Send them."” Some of these shipments were sent and were received. Unbelievable, isn't it? But they were received. We even have receipts from those shipments. Admittedly, the end results were absolutely miserable. This interests me greatly. How long did your meeting last? Half an hour, 45 minutes. - What did you see of the camp? - Nothing. Some buildings, which I saw from where I was. - Wooden buildings? - Wooden military buildings. Maybe the guard barracks. In any case, I didn't see any crematory furnaces in activity. The buildings in Auschwitz were brick, not wood. Yes, it was brick. They were like any military buildings. I saw groups of prisoners. I passed many, many groups of prisoners. - In striped pyjamas? - Striped pyjamas, wearing little caps. They were as thin as - No need to say it, is there? They watched this car bearing the Red Cross pennant with eyes that... Did you see the famous inscription over the door: "Arbeit macht frei"? I didn't see that. - You didn't go in that gate? - No. I didn't enter from the train station, and I didn't see... And you're sure it was the camp commander you met? Yes, because the guy gave his... You know, they never saw anyone. Visits were rare. I realise that, but you said he was young. There were several camp commanders. - He might've been 55, but no older. - That's different. I met a guy with the same look, the same style, in the Congo, a mercenary leader named Schramme. He called himself a colonel. Being with Schramme felt exactly like being with the camp commander. When you visited, Höss was no longer there. He'd left. How long did you stay in Auschwitz? Not in the camp, the city. - I didn't see the city. - You didn't sleep there? I couldn't sleep there because for me, the whole area was forbidden. Totally forbidden. Of Birkenau, you suspected nothing? No, nothing. The Birkenau death camp was a half mile from the main camp. That's right. Nothing. But by then, we already knew. I only knew from Geneva, what transpired in Geneva, but when at the location, nothing. What did you know at that time? I knew there was a concentration camp to which masses of Jews were deported and they died there. - You knew when you were at Auschwitz? - I knew. - You arrived with this knowledge? - I knew they'd been deported en masse, by train, and that they were condemned. That was certain. - You didn't see any trains? - No trains. - It wasn't possible to speak of that? - Out of the question. You know, those people were... It seems unbelievable, but we spoke like I'm speaking to you. These people were proud of their work. - How was this pride shown? - Oh, nothing, but I felt that I was doing something useful. They gave that impression because if you spoke of the prisoners, they'd answer, "Yes, but Germany is accomplishing an incredible task "for which all of Europe will thank us." It's quite an astonishing thing to be almost friendly with these people - who, after all, were master liars. - Certainly. Did you trust them? Oh, trust... What do you expect? No. It was pure theatre, everyone played their part. That's all. And after you returned from Auschwitz? I wrote up a report of a visit to the Kommandantur of Auschwitz. But, you know, it was awfully little. You enter that place with chills down your back, you think, "I must get to Auschwitz," yet you return empty-handed. So you must be perfectly lucid. You return empty-handed, - and while visiting, you saw nothing. - You see nothing. Empty-handed means having no viable information. You didn't feel anything? I've been to Auschwitz, but much later. Even seeing it today, we're gripped by a feeling of horror. Your feeling of horror would be even greater if you'd seen the lines of prisoners, groups of 30 or 40, as thin as skeletons. When you see, I don't know, 400 or 500 just on the route you're on - Seeing these people, did you feel that they were suffering greatly, that they were dying, or condemned to death? That's exactly what it was. They were literally walking skeletons because they weren't fed, were they? Only their eyes still lived. Only their eyes still lived. They called them "Mussulmen". - They have a very intense gaze. - Very intense. Those people look at you with incredible intensity, as if to say, "What have we here? "Look, a visitor from the living, who's not an SS." - You wore civilian clothing? - Always. You didn't have a uniform? No, that would have been a catastrophe. Of course. - Did your report mention the groups? - Of course. But this wasn't news. These things were already well-known. One can never say enough about how negligible and sad this was. It was known? Earlier you said you didn't know. We didn't. They knew in Geneva. I learned afterwards. I knew, for example, that Joint knew things like that. It surprises me, in hindsight, that they never contacted our delegation to say, "We have this information. We know precisely this, this, this. "Do you know anything?" But nothing. Does this mean that when you were in the office of the camp commander, or someone who claimed to be, in Auschwitz, did you know at that precise moment - this is important - that you were in the heart of a death camp? I didn't know the scope of the matter. Not at all. I knew it was a horrific camp, and that those sent to Auschwitz never returned. But we had no idea of the masses that it represented. We knew it was a horrific camp, that's all. Did you see any glows? The Poles who lived in Auschwitz today say they saw the glow of flames. I didn't see any glows nor smoke. - Nothing? - Nothing. - Nor smelled anything? - No odours either. There's always a bad smell around military barracks, but these stories of smelling charred flesh... Others might have smelled it or saw it, but not me. - It depended on the wind. - That's possible. Now let's speak of Theresienstadt. Theresienstadt was a big problem. A very big problem. Theresienstadt was an organised visit... organised by the Germans under pressure of repeated demands from foreigners, in particular, the ICRC, but also other neutral countries. I participated in that organised visit. - You represented... - The ICRC in Theresienstadt, on this first visit, because there were two or three visits. There was a visit afterwards. On this visit, my job was to see what they showed me. I filed a report which I don't reject. I uphold it as entirely valid. If I was sent there as a pair of eyes, I should look, and also look beyond, if there was something to be seen. People say Theresienstadt was a Potemkin camp, neatly arranged for the visit of the Czarina. It's perhaps even worse than that. It was an arranged visit, obviously. It was June 23, 1944. Thank you. I couldn't remember the date. It was an arranged visit. You might say it was a piece of theatre. But there is one thing that needs to be clarified... You ask, "What was the climate in Berlin? "What was the climate in Auschwitz?" There... ...we got the impression of falseness. Firstly, because the visit had been requested, expected, and as always, in wartime, when something is expected, there is a setup, but what immediately bothered me was the attitude of the Jewish actors. It was a Potemkin camp, a fake camp. - Forgive me for speaking frankly - - You must. But at my age, if you don't speak your mind.. Absolutely. It was a camp for the privileged. It's horrible to say, and, good Lord, I can't accuse anyone... I don't want to wound those people who suffered terribly - but unfortunately, the Prominenten were there. This camp gave the impression of holding Jews who were very rich or prominent figures in their towns, who couldn't disappear too abruptly. The number of notables there was totally unbelievable compared with other camps... even prison camps. There were countless doctors, notables on every street corner. Their attitude was also very odd. A man whose job, for months, is to visit prison camps is accustomed to having a man wink at him, drawing his attention to something. Such actions were commonplace. But here, nothing. Only a docility, a passivity, which for me, created an even worse uneasiness. To speak absolutely frankly, the camp was not just a visit organised by the SS from which you could only report, "I saw this and that, I photographed this." I photographed whatever I liked. I brought back lots and lots of photos. They say a picture is worth a thousand words, don't they? I took lots of photos, but the climate felt fake due to the impression that these Jews also considered themselves as Prominenten a well-loved word at the time, meaning they were privileged and they had no intention of risking being deported. If they made a simple allusion, or remark, passed a paper or a report... it would have been so easy, for we weren't spied on, nor filmed. Today's means of surveillance didn't exist. When you pass through corridors, city streets, a room, if someone wanted to slip something in your pocket, either mine or one of the two others, it would have been extremely simple. I understand what you're saying. It's a very important point. How long did your visit last? I'd say about two or three hours. Not longer? In your report, you said it was much longer. If you say so. You know, it was in 1943... 1944, Along time ago. I can't be precise, but now my impression was two or three hours, tops. You arrived around 10:00 a.m., had lunch, and left around 6:00 p.m. Yes, but part of the visit was outside the city. They clearly explained that there was the kleine Festung, which we had no right to enter. We were told, "We'll just go past it. "They're just the common criminals. "They're another type of prisoner. That's none of your business. "You're here to visit the city itself. Well, you know the city. It's a Vauban-style citadel, a bit like Langres. In fact, it was built in the same architectural style. - It's a fortress. - A walled fortress which had never been attacked and so, was intact. - You visited it accompanied by... - By consulate employees. I think they were Danish or Dutch. I don't remember. Danish? Danish. And as always, by the Germans. The SS, who had organised the visit... I couldn't tell you their names. - You didn't ask their names? - No. ! don't even remember their faces. - Did you see many Jews? - Many? They were all Jews. I saw no other people there. They all wore the star. I only saw Jews. - Didn't one of them speak to you. - Yes, Dr. Whatshisname? - Eppstein. - Eppstein, the leader of the camp. He was our guide. But at no point did he say... It's incredible that no one said, "This is all a farce!"... had it been that extreme. Why do you say it was a farce, today? - Did you know that at the time? - No. But we knew that if we were invited to visit a camp, it would be a "special” camp. You're absolutely right to call it a farce. It was extraordinarily well prepared. They'd been preparing for your visit for months. They called it the Verschönerungsaktion, or "the act of embellishing"” You really did visit a Potemkin ghetto. Did you feel that at the time? I believed, and I still believe, I was shown a camp for Jewish notables, for the privileged. That's the impression it left on me. I never put it in writing. I found the behaviour of the people there extremely unpleasant... the attitude of the Jews in that city. I had the impression that there were Jews - and I still think the same - who, using dollars from their Portuguese bank accounts, bought a better situation for themselves and stayed alive. You know as well as I that certain extremely wealthy Jews received exit visas signed by Himmler. We spoke about this... Not with those in the camp, but among ourselves. If we were rich enough to own a quarter of Budapest, or Csepel Island, and we were Mr. So-and-So from one of those dynasties... Like what happened to the Weiss family? Those people had enough money to clear their status and get visas. I had the impression that the people there lacked the international renown of the Weiss or the Rothschild families, but had enough power and money to be there. That was my private impression of Theresienstadt. Even today, I still believe that, despite everything I was told. - What were you told? - That it was purely for the visit, and immediately afterwards, these people were exterminated. I still believe they were Jewish notables wealthy enough to pay for their survival. They were exterminated before your visit and also exterminated after. - I know many were exterminated after. - After your visit. Furthermore, Himmler's original idea, in creating Theresienstadt, was to create a ghetto for the Jews of the Greater Reich - Germany, Austria and Czechoslovakia - for Jews it was delicate to attack because they were World War I veterans. They were very elderly... old men and women. It's true that among them were what you call Prominenten, Jewish community leaders and so on. They were deported to Theresienstadt. But Himmler wanted to camouflage their scheme of general extermination, so Theresienstadt was something they wanted to display. The truth is, before the Red Cross visit, almost 100,000 Jews who passed through Theresienstadt were deported to Auschwitz and Treblinka where they died, and also after the visit. The Theresienstadt ghetto lived in constant terror. What you saw, and I understand how you feel, was the terror... of these Jews. The man who was your guide, the famous mayor of Theresienstadt, the ghetto president, Dr. Eppstein... ...didn't you say earlier that he spoke like a robot? That's right. He was executed exactly three months after your visit. It's always... In the Small Fortress. But, you know, it was typical of the Germans, and of any regime that organises death camps, to employ certain prisoners... as administrators and organisers, who, after a while, perfectly aware of what happens to those they themselves let be sent off to be massacred, already know they won't survive. That's what is so extraordinarily sadistic. They didn't really need administrators, but they always found among these politicians or Jews a class of people who believed they'd survive or last a few more months as employees of... - This is a big problem. - That's what is horrible. This is where man sinks lower than low. This is a big problem. It happened in all the major Eastern ghettos. In all ghettos, I suppose. It's the problem of the Judenräte. But your report described Theresienstadt as fairly satisfactory. In terms of hygiene, yes, from what I saw. I was sent there as a pair of eyes, to see. Earlier you said you were also there to see beyond what was shown. What I saw beyond that was this subjection, this passivity, which is something I wasn't able to accept. You're referring to... it's interesting, because I have details of the preparations for your visit. All the measures taken. Incredibly, it's all there in your report. You say you could take all the photos you wanted. That's precisely what they hoped you'd do. Of course. For example, they had all the streets cleaned, and paved. That was a first step. On the main square of Theresienstadt, across from the Kaffee Haus, they built, shortly before your arrival, a concert hall on which an orchestra would play. You mentioned the orchestra in your report. - You see? I don't even remember. - It's true. It didn't exist before, and it didn't exist afterwards. I tell you this to show the sheer scale of the deception and its preparations. They put benches on the square, in the so-called "public park". In your report, you write, almost with wonder, of a children's playground, an area for babies and toddlers, a sort of Kinder Pavillon, cheerfully decorated, with a kitchen, a shower and cribs. It was built shortly before you arrived and destroyed after for the simple reason that births were forbidden in Theresienstadt. Abortions were obligatory. Allowing Jewish births went against their extermination policy. Also, they put up colourful signs saying, "To the bank" or "To the post office". "To the cafe", which they also did in death camps. In Treblinka, it was the same. The train station had a pretty clock, but the hands never moved. The few houses you visited had been entirely renovated. You also wrote you had a meal where the waitress wore a starched bonnet. This was all prepared exclusively for you. You write, "The state of their clothing is generally satisfactory. "People in the streets are properly dressed, "with the same differences one sees in towns between the rich and less rich. "The elegant ladies have silk stockings, hats, scarves, modern handbags. "The young people are also well-dressed, some even sporting the Zazou style."” All prepared for you. Of course. In your report, one of your rare criticisms was about overcrowding. The overcrowding was so severe that to prepare for your visit, 5,000 were deported to Auschwitz and immediately gassed, so it would be less crowded and make a better impression. You spoke of the bank. It was all prepared for your visit. They renamed the streets too. You wrote of freedom of religion. You visited a synagogue. There was no synagogue. It was a sort of gym, transformed into a synagogue a week earlier. They changed everything, even the terms. "Ghetto" was replaced with "Jüdisches Siedlungsgebiet” The Judenälteste, which was Eppstein, had his title changed to "Mayor" of Theresienstadt. They forbid the Grusspflicht which forced all Jews to salute the Nazis. You never saw it because it was punishable by death to salute Nazis in front of you. They even did full-scale rehearsals before your visit. They were nervous. They were so afraid you'd suspect something that they rehearsed like crazy. Your visit was organised down to the last inch, to the last second. When you wrote about the housing conditions, you found them quite decent and satisfactory. You saw nothing of Theresienstadt... because if you'd visited the huts and barracks, they were just like in Auschwitz. - Of course. - Sleeping... Now I'm aware of all that. They slept four or five to a bed in horrific conditions. You wrote of the food, and even the calorie count. 2,400 calories. That's what they told you. - They did. - It was 1,200. They were starving. You wrote of 12 to 15 deaths per day in your report, which is 400 a month. It was 5,000 deaths per month. At Theresienstadt they didn't show you their incredible crematorium, as good as Auschwitz, with four huge furnaces. They burnt people. ll mean, Theresienstadt was... it's such a terrifying story. Conditions were horrific, with constant deportations to Auschwitz and Treblinka. It never stopped. Eppstein, whom you mentioned, was in reality a very brave man. Due to his courage and the speech he made three months after you left, they executed him in the Small Fortress. The Small Fortress. What... I wanted to ask you... It's not surprising you were fooled because that was their intention. - Of course. - Everything was done to fool you. Yet... you say... the attitude of the Jews bothered you, their passivity, - it that correct? - That's right. I'd like to know why you say that now? Why wasn't it in your report? In your report, you state, "I saw a normal provincial town". - Right. - "Almost normal." That's what I was shown. I had nothing to add. I couldn't make up things I hadn't seen. You couldn't make things up, but you could have... You said the problem was seeing beyond... - Beyond. - Couldn't you sense it was fake? In such cases, as I said, you expect a wink, a nudge, but nothing. When I say nothing, it was nothing. Nothing. Even today I don't understand these people. Today we know they knew that they were lost, condemned. - How could... - You never believe it. You cling to hope. They clung to hope. To me, they lived in that hope. They played their parts, as you said, and we have proof, as their last chance to stay alive. They acted out of terror. It's very clear. - Anyway, you never spoke to any Jews. - Not one. - Only Eppstein spoke to you. - A few words. I thought he gave an introductory speech from which you drew most of the information in your report. Possibly. I don't remember the speech. You state in your report, and this is quite interesting... you state, "To our great astonishment, ghetto life was almost like normal life..." - That's true. - "When we expected the worst." "We told the SS officers accompanying us how surprised we were "by the difficulties in getting permission to visit Theresienstadt." Exactly what they wanted you to believe. If you write it's "a normal town", why do you later write, "This Jewish town is truly surprising"? If it's a normal town, what's so surprising? It's difficult for me to think like the man I was back then, but it wasn't what I expected. I expected conditions similar to when I visited POWs or disciplinary prisons for noncommissioned officers. The people we'd see were thin, gaunt, like those we saw in the deportation camps, even train stations. After seeing that, Theresienstadt seemed like a town for privileged Jews. - They weren't thin? - No, they weren't. They were starving. They weren't thin, not those I saw. - They hid the thin ones. - They must have. The children weren't thin, not at all. I also wanted to ask, you state, about family life... About family life, you state, if you'll excuse me... You state, "Due to overcrowding, family life is difficult in Theresienstadt. "Many living in group barracks are separated. "Naturally, they are free to join each other in the morning, "and since they are generally elderly, there are no complaints.” I don't understand what that implies. I meant that if a couple were separated and they were both elderly, they wouldn't suffer from... - Needs of the flesh. - That's probably what I meant, but I have no idea. You told my colleague that people avoided you like the plague. That's for sure. People avoided me. That was obvious. Was that "acting"? They avoided you because they couldn't act. Perhaps. But no one tried to say anything. No one took the risk of saying, “I'm going to scream. I'll speak up. " - It meant instant death. - Instant death. Without a doubt. I don't know how I'd react. I've never had a gun in my back. But still, this passivity Is very hard to accept. You lay the blame on them? No. It is not my place to judge, but, yes, I'm astonished they could put on this "play"” involving several hundred people and everyone played along. The Jews were actors, but the directors were the Germans. Without a doubt. You conclude your report with, “Our report will change no one's judgment. “You are free to condemn the Reich's attitude in resolving the Jewish problem. "However, if this report clarifies the mystery of the Theresienstadt ghetto, “that will be enough. " What exactly did you mean by that? Who were the people whose judgment you hoped to change? In any case, we were all against these racial segregations, against isolating Jews in ghettos. It went so totally against our mentality as humble Swiss. We'd never seen that, and that alone was horrific, even if we weren't aware of the mass exterminations. Today, do you regret this report? I don't see how it could have been different. I'd still write it today. - In full knowledge of all I've said? - Absolutely. - You were tricked - Yes, but... In reality, it was a hellhole. You don't say it's paradise, but your report is optimistic. Do you remember Eppstein? His physical appearance? I can't picture him. I see an elderly man. No, I can't picture him. I can't describe him for you. They killed him exactly three months after your visit. The deportations to Auschwitz had started again, Theresienstadt's greatest fear. The ghetto was in panic. He made the following speech... I'll read an excerpt, roughly translated... "Theresienstadt will only survive by radically mobilising itself for work." They thought working would save them. "No talk, only work. No speculation. "We are on a ship trying to come ashore, "but the harbour is blocked by mines." This was in September 1944, They had news of the events in the outside world. "Only the captain of the ship knows the narrow passage "leading to safe harbour. "He must ignore deceptive lights and signals arriving from the coast. "The vessel must stay where it is and await orders. "You must trust your leaders who do all that is humanly possible "to assure the security of our existence. "Let's start the New Year..." The Jewish New Year, in September... "Let's start the New Year seriously and confidently, "with the firm intention of holding out and doing our duty." They killed him a few days later, in the Small Fortress, in the kleine Festung, they put a bullet in his head. It's a heartbreaking document.
