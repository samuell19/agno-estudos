Aida! Give us a big smile, Aida. Big smile. Smile, Aida. - Smile, Aida! - Smile, Aida! Good morning, Aida. Good morning, Madame Samiha. Did you hear the bomb? Was there an explosion? I thought I was dreaming. The humidity is a curse. I couldn't sleep till dawn. I can't breathe! They say it's a heat wave that will pass. Will the explosions also pass? That shameless Susu! Why the raise in rent? The water pipes are all rusty. Do you have water? No, I saved this yesterday. Will you talk to Susu about the raise? Sure, I will. Thank you for calling. Please leave a message after the beep. Ahmed Sedky. Bye. Bye, dear. Aida, listen. I can't see a thing. If you hear of a job here or there, don't forget me. You want to work? The truth is I need to work. I have some experience in different fields. Acting, translation, management. I'll tell you when you have more time. Bye. Bye, Aida. Filtered and pure. Water. Water for next to nothing. Spring water. Quench your thirst with pure water. Filtered and pure. Spring water. I went to the cinema. I got actors ready. I prepared their wardrobes. I got everything ready. I did everything by hand. What more could I have done? Now the health is gone. Mind the speed! Look in front of you! I didn't come near you, crazy broad! What are you doing? Apologize to her. I didn't go near her! She's nuts. She's my neighbor. You're a good lad, apologize. Sorry, miss, I didn't know you were from here. Thank you. Why is it so crowded today? Maybe they let off a bomb or two. God have mercy on us. I'll get out here and walk. "Before, I was always worried, and I couldn't do a thing." "With the new Forever with wings, every day is my day! Every moment is my moment!" "Nothing can stand in my way! Let's fly with the new Forever with wings!" Now, move your body with the jingle. Let's fly with Forever, don't forget. - You're 33? - Yes, I am. You don't look like you do in the casting video. - She doesn't look A class. - We've asked for A class. Come on, let's go. "In Paradise Estate, I can jog comfortably, among the trees, the waterfalls, the lake, and listen to the birds sing." "Yes, I can!" We have to work together to beat the evil ones, my friend, and free our beautiful town, so we can live happy together forever. - Happily. - Happily. Let's do it one last time. Forever. Good. Let's take a break. Is the accountant here for the paychecks? - Good evening, great artist! - Good evening. - The rent? - I have it. Bless! Come inside for the receipt. I'll pick it up from Mrs. Susu in the morning. Your engagement dress to Naguib Mahfouz will win the Nobel prize. Age 4, red taffeta with white ruffles. Age 5, French guipure with velvet trimmings. Age 6, satin duchesse, baby blue with checkered lining. Age 7, green silk with flowers and lace ribbons. Age 8, pink tulle with bébé collar and ruffled sleeves. Age 9, pink crepe Georgette with cherries on the collar. Save me, please! Save me! Help me, Aida! What happened? I came outside to escape the heat, I tripped in the dark. I'll call an ambulance. Ambulances only come in the movies! I'll go get Hamdy. Please hurry. Am Hamdy! Am Hamdy! Excuse me, do you remember me? Of course. Can you help me get my neighbor to a hospital? Sure, let's go. - I don't know your name. - Yassin. Aida. Who's this? Our neighbor, Yassin. He'll help us get to the hospital. I'll get changed. You're leaving me alone with him? Don't worry, it will be all right. Really? Have you broken a leg before? Will I walk again, or will I remain a cripple forever? Cut the drama, please. Don't worry, you'll walk, and even run if you want to. I just want to walk. - Where to? - The hospital. Why? My mother fell and broke her leg. - Who is the lady? - I'm the neighbor. Okay. Go on. I'm your mother? I'm sorry. Shall we go back, so I can say you're not my mother? I had to say something to get us moving. His name and ID number. Mohamed Yassin Abdel Hamid. Two, nine, six. Zero, nine, one, five. Two, one, zero, four, nine, nine, nine. Where to? I've broken my leg and my son is taking me to hospital. Our neighbor here is coming to help. Who's the patient? Isn't it obvious? - How are you related to them? - He's her son, I'm the neighbor. - It says "divorced" in the ID. - Can't a divorcée have a son? We're going to be here all night. What can we do? It's like the whole city was dying tonight. The emergency room is always like this. Is it very swollen? No, not really. No, it's swollen. These are not the nails of a street dweller. You're from a good family? So they say. Yassin is our neighbor. Ah! Our neighbor. What's your building number? Twenty-four, third floor, apartment 11. Samiha Adel Gubran, Samiha! God bless your beautiful children. May I ask what brings you here? Why didn't you go to a private hospital? Well… You'll be all right. You broke it playing football, naughty one? Very funny. Sorry, you looked upset, so I thought I'd cheer you up a bit. Many happy returns! Many happy returns. How long have you been our neighbor for? I haven't seen you before. It's not my place. How do you know about this place? I used to come to this hospital a lot, a long time ago. Do you have a cigarette for me? I'd quit for a while now… But humans are weak. Humans are weak. I'd forgotten how awful it tasted. Crap! You know what? I used to study medicine. You're a doctor? No, I did one year and couldn't go on. I quit and didn't tell any of my family. I was Doctor Aida until someone saw me on stage and relayed the news to the village. And? All hell broke loose for a while. My dad stopped talking to me… But I survived. One can survive anything. You act. I've been an aspiring actress for the last ten years. And you? Me? What did you study? What are you studying? I was studying law, but I stopped for a bit. I don't see the point anymore. Of what? Law? Yes, law. What are you doing now? I do odd jobs here and there to get by. I'm also starting a project with some friends. Tell me about it. I'd rather surprise you when we're done. I can't thank you enough. I have to thank the both of you. Without you, I would still be lying on the ground. This way, Son. Get the water. - What happened? - Welcome back! As you can see, a total disaster! Who left the tap open when the water was out? The rusty pipes that you didn't want to fix definitely exploded. Who is this cutie? The boyfriend? That was inappropriate, madam. You're going to teach me manners? The plaster will melt. Enough! If I weren't in a cast, I would have shown you! Show me! We pay rent. We're lawful tenants. You pay rent, really? How many months do you owe, sweetheart? - I just paid your son the rent. - No. Liar! Where's your receipt, princess? And you, have you also paid my son? I owe three months' rent. Can you pay the rent and the damages? Come on. Work. - Can I help? - No, thanks. I'm very sorry. I can convince Mother to let you stay. Aida! Don't forget the photograph of Mommy and Daddy, next to the door. I want you badly. Did you get everything I told you about? I got what I could. - What's wrong? - Please come with me. Don't leave me. - I can let you stay. - Will you shut up! - What is the matter? - Pretend he's not here. Let's get this over with and get out of here. Did you see what the miserly Susu did? Who are these people? You haven't seen them before? A neighbor has been giving out meat for the feast. People spend the night here to get in line. Where to now? Shall I get a cab? I don't know where to go. Don't you have someone you can stay with? Now? Whose door can I knock on at dawn and say, "Please give me shelter"? Impossible! I need a cup of coffee and a cigarette to clear my head. - Yassin Basha! - Good morning, Am Ahmed. - Coffee? - Three black coffees? Three black coffees. I feel faint. - I'm hungry. - I'll go get food. Don't get beans. They're too heavy this early in the morning. He doesn't work for us. What can he find other than beans now? Who said he worked for us? I'm an invalid as you can see. How am I supposed to get food? You could've gone. He was so quick. I didn't get a chance. These beans are delicious. Is anyone going to eat this sandwich? Have it, I am already full. I didn't know you smoked. I spoke to an agent who will find you something, but it will take some time. - How long? - A week or two. Where will you go now? I'll manage. What will you do? I don't know, I have no money. I have nothing. This is all I have, and I'm not selling it. How were you going to manage? Things would've sorted themselves out. Didn't I ask you to find me some work? What work? Work. Do you think I'm a good-for-nothing? Thank you for calling. Please leave a message after the beep. I have a sister. Sherifa. I haven't seen her in a long time. I think I could stay with her. She moved to one of these desert compounds. - Don't you have her number? - I told you I don't speak to her. It's a long story. You must know someone who has her number. Auntie Rafia. I'm Samiha. Samiha, Ihsan's daughter. Madam, please. She's been like this for long? On some days, she is alert and can't stop talking. Unfortunately, of late, she's been in this state. You're her brother's daughter? Her sister's daughter. I made an exception by letting you see her. She's my aunt, my mother's sister! Why can't you give me my sister's number? You don't have your sister's number? Can we leave Madame Sherifa a note? Here comes speedy Yassin! How did it go? Where did you find it? It's great. I won't sit in a wheelchair. I'm not a cripple. It's getting hot, and it's going to be a long day. Leave me here with the elderly and the crippled. I'm an invalid, homeless, friendless old hag. Enough of this. I know just the place to change your mood. Isn't it pretty? Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. You haven't seen it in its full glory. I've had some very good days here. I've travelled everywhere, but I've always wanted to come back. My heart would race in the airport. I escaped a marriage because I couldn't stand being away. Hussein, now, in this heat! And the crowds! I have a small errand I need to run. God bless his soul. Your father was such a good man. I used to come here just to be with him, to be here. He had a story about each object here. Excellent piece! We don't see workmanship like this anymore. How much? I can't pay more than three thousand. Isn't it too little? No one will pay more. Can I see it, please? I don't know a thing about diamonds, and this is really beautiful… And we're not selling. Thank you very much. "It is really beautiful, and we're not selling." "Thank you very much." I said what needed to be said. How do you know this place? The first time I came here, I was 17. I came with the most beautiful man born on this land. Behind this column… I gave him a kiss, punishable by law! You kissed in the open? Lower your voice! I tell you, behind the column! It will be fine here. Yes, they say bombs. If you know something, tell me, so I can see how to get home. Yes, voluntary curfew. What a load of bull! Peace keeping! Bassem is severely depressed. Don't take it personally if he's a bit aloof. I got you the green oranges you like. Good one. Thank you, precious. Let's have tea? Let's have tea. I would like some tea too. As you can see, the place is… Not clean. Beautiful sideboard! My uncle had an identical one in his estate before everything was sold. Tell her the story of the sideboard. You tell her. It was a present to his grandma from the landlord where her dad worked. The grandma offered it to her daughter, Bassem's mother, for her wedding. Bassem didn't marry his girlfriend Eva and didn't go with her to Germany because he couldn't part with the sideboard. She was nice. Eva? You know better, Adam. - Two? - Three. Thanks. - Four. - Four. Honestly, what was wrong with Eva? I would've been in Germany by now. It's cold there, everything is cold. The people are cold, the women are cold. Tell him! You know about women. I'll go get a few things before the peacekeeping starts for real. Any special requests? - Are you taking your medication? - Yes. How is it? It gives a mediocre high. You know, hash is expensive nowadays. What medication? You take medication? Are you out of your mind? What's the matter? This shit is only harmful. It eats away at the soul. It's better to kill yourself and get it over with. Madame Samiha! Hang these for me, please. Make room for me next to you. The charlatan doctors would happily sedate us all. They'd prescribe anti-depressants for the whole country… So we'd see everything rosy all the time. It's cheaper than hash, as you said. She's right. You're looking a bit fuchsia. Thank you for calling. Please leave a message after the beep. Ahmed Sedky. Are you okay? I don't know. I'll be okay. I guess. How's it going with Ahmed? I don't see him. He's busy. Nothing new. But you know what? I'm tired. You deserve better than this, Aida. It'll let the mosquitoes in. Worried about mosquitoes and not gunfire? The mosquitoes are fierce. I heard from the grapevine that you have a heavenly voice. Heavenly? That's generous! Please sing to brighten up this darkness. Here's a word about My plight I told you Now, there is one word left I saved it for you My memories Deep within I saved it from an unjust world I was scared They would see it And kill it In a dark alley It bloomed when the light Was still young The cactus flower It did indeed O blowing Longing breeze Take a word home In the morning As long as we're led Intuition and foresight By sight And through eyes Then We're safe Then We're safe Then we see Where we're going Bravo. Don't you miss the theater? I wish I were half an artist, but with plenty of money. What would you do with it? I wouldn't leave the house. The electricity's been cut. Lucky is he who has lungs and gills. The locusts will eat the whole crop. Don't be scared. Congratulations! You've earned the honor of serving the nation. Can I go to the toilet? Bassem. - I'm leaving. - You're leaving? - Take care. - See you. - Thanks a lot. - Bye, Yassin. - What are you doing tonight? - I have a meeting regarding the project. "I have a meeting regarding the project." You like to make fun of me. Yes, the project? I'd rather surprise you when we're done. - Thank you. - What for? For everything. - I'll see you? - Sure thing. Hussein! Aida Hussein? I'm Hend. Hend Amer. - Hend! - Come! I've missed you. I didn't recognize you. I missed you very much. I looked for you everywhere. Where did you go? A great suitor asked for my hand in marriage. He demanded I cut off contact with everyone. He was so understanding of my circumstances, I just couldn't refuse. God blessed me with Jannah who's seven, and Jude who's four. I am so happy for you. God is all generous. I believed these people we were with. Suddenly, God showed me their true colors. They spoke about freedom as if they created it. They were abusing me, the bastards. God is generous. You're happy now. God grant me forgiveness. You know, I am afraid of meeting God. I'm frightened. God is great. I was young and naive. God, all generous, please, forgive me. God will show you the path of the faithful. Did you see my new watch? My husband bought it for me for 3000 pounds. Expensive, but I'm worth it, right? Of course you are. You still don't wear a watch? Time slips by like this. Have a couple of children to fill your life. Maybe. It's getting really hot. I can't breathe here anymore. Please turn up the AC. We're moving to Paradise Estate. Have you heard of it? - Why are you so quiet? - I'm thinking. Rest that head of yours a bit. How's acting? I'm still struggling. You still act in student projects? Do you still believe in the role of art and all that nonsense? Unbelievable! Do something that pays the bills. I love acting, Hend. You loved acting too. You think you know best and look at you! Look at the world around you and adapt. How? Like I did. I am doing quite well, am I not? Take some, miss, please help me. Take some, miss, please help me. How much? What flowers, Aida? Go away, girl! May you get married. Remember, we used to get a lot of these. These are for your sweet daughters. Thank you. You shouldn't have. They've sprayed it with perfume, the bastards. Indian jasmine, sir? Help me, please. I'm very late. I have to go now. I'll get out here. The driver can take you anywhere you want. No, that's okay. It was nice seeing you. Think about what I told you. Buy a watch. There is but one God. Good morning, Haj Omran. Good? The country is on fire and you are having a party. What party? Music and laughter until dawn. Do you feel no shame! - Who's this woman? - My guest. Good morning. What's the fuss about? There were two others. As well? They were my guests. There was no party. Even if I had a party, I can do what I want in my house! No, you can't. We saw the women's underwear on the washing line. Wait. He who sees vice has to correct it. Our religion tells us this. Talk to him! Don't be silent! Shame on you people. Your hearts are blind. I'm old enough to be his mother. You'll find us downstairs. Bye. I am sorry about this mess. Aida's friends are my friends. Aida is my sister. Your neighbors are very difficult. Everyone's become difficult. You stood your ground well. You were legendary. I am afraid they'll take it out on you later. We'll only get what's in store for us. I want to tell you something. You have a real talent. Don't let all the shit around us make you forget it. I know that it is difficult but... I can't take it anymore. You have faith, don't you? Never forget your talent. Come into my arms. Who's this Murad? I can't stay with just anyone. I can sell the pendant, and we can rent out a hotel room. Murad Helmy is my teacher and an old friend. I met him when I first moved here. Murad, what? Murad Helmy. I know him! I know Murad Helmy. What a surprise! You didn't say you were bringing Samiha Gubran. Long time no see. Very long time. As you can see, I am in trouble as usual. - Where do you know each other from? - Long story, dear. Right? Very long! What happened, sweethearts? You look like refugees. We need to stay here for a couple of days if you don't mind. You don't need to ask, do you? I think there's food in the fridge. Eat first, then tell me all about it. No need to treat us like guests. I'll make tea, do you want to eat? No, thank you, I'll have tea with you. Holla hom. You could've said you didn't want tea. Murad offered me a real drink. I couldn't say no. It would be rude. I'm innocent, sir. Aida knows nothing of the old Samiha. Seeing me like this… It's hard to believe I was once beautiful and mischievous. I was very difficult though. I was like a magnet. Everyone wanted to be near me. You're like that too. You have this appeal. But as you can see, nothing lasts. This is how Egyptians have lived since forever. On the ground. See, this is real art! Before, I was always worried. I couldn't do anything. Now, with the new Forever with wings, I can fly. Fly, fly, fly. Not funny. You can fly, but you insist on staying put. Let's hear Murad Helmy, the expert on of Aida Hussein's affairs. How silly! Why don't you work with me? Because it's not possible. Do you think I would be the way I am now if I hadn't met you? You came to me. You came because you didn't fit in with farmers nor were you doctor material. You wanted to learn, try things out, and above all else, you had a dream. A dream! Oh, how much I hurt myself in my dream. I let you do whatever you wanted. Do you believe this? Besides, isn't this all history now? Isn't Murad over? Didn't you meet the love of your life? Where is the great writer now? He's working. What do you want now? You want to go back to the village and raise ducks? If it will make you happy, go. You want to get married and have children? I'll marry you. Cut the silly jokes. I am not joking. You know what your problem is? You've never really loved yourself. I love you. I love the farmer girl hiding inside you. I love the actress, the brave, resilient one. I love you. Marry me, Aida. I need you. I am sorry, Murad. I've wronged you. I am sorry. Do you think Ahmed will marry an actress? He'll dump you after he's had enough. An actress is no more than a cheap whore. Hey, pretty one! Hey, cutie! Come spend the night with us. Forget it, she thinks she's a film star. What's going on? - She's dead. - You know her? - No. - What are you doing at this hour? I live here. I came down to buy water. The water is out. Death on Delbany street, number 23, the looney old lady. Go now! - What will you do with her? - The morgue, what else? Don't you ever sleep? I do, but not a lot. What happened? Order me some tea first. Am Ahmed, one tea, please. An orphan girl was called By the captain of the boat The captain told me Stay away from the treacherous sea An orphan girl was called By the sailor The sailor told me Stay away from the sea, move on The blood of a bride is redder Than henna So happy, the blood was It splattered on robes The blood of a bride is redder Than a fez So happy, the blood was It splattered on faces Good morning! Where is Aida? I don't know. She left. The view is great from here. Look at the Nile. It looks depressed. It's had enough of us. Please cut this artists' talk. Look at what has become of the city! - What happened to it? - What has become of it? It changed, that's all. Nothing stays the same. I will die all alone in this dump. What's so strange about that? We're born alone, and we die alone. In between that, we have some good times. We've had some good times, haven't we? Yes, we did. We can't have two lives, can we? I know it is difficult to let go of Aida. All this energy, all this life force… But youth belongs with youth. I didn't know your mother was in Cairo. I keep her for emergencies. I don't get it. It is difficult to explain. I've missed you, girl. Mother, Madame Samiha, my neighbor. Welcome dear, welcome. Welcome. Hope you get better soon. God bless you. Show her the bedroom so she can rest till I finish cooking. I'll come with you. I haven't cooked for a long time. Come in! I didn't know you cooked. Can you believe a kilo costs 16 pounds? They say the crops burnt from the heat. Why didn't you buy a frozen pack? Frozen! It's not like you eat with me everyday. They cancelled the swimming lessons this week. There is no water to fill the pool. - You swim? - No, I'm still learning. They give lessons for adults in the youth center. Bravo! It's so nice to learn new things all the time. I'll show you something. You'll appreciate it. What do you think of this dress? Very nice. You made it yourself? I made it for the neighbor's engagement. I spent a month working on it. Then she said her fiancé thinks it's too revealing. Aida could wear it for her engagement. Are you getting engaged, Aida? Go try it on. I want to see you in it. It's too revealing. Please your mother. Try it on. Let's finish cooking first. I am like any mother. I want to see her as a bride. I want to hold her children. Is that too much to ask? I won't marry anyone just to make you happy. How come you still haven't met someone? It's all a matter of luck. Marriage is luck indeed… But a clever woman is never at a loss. Don't you long for your belly to fill up with a baby? I don't want to have children. Is there a woman who doesn't want children? I only wanted them with one man, but then he left. Is this a place to raise children in? She's right on that one. I can raise them. Didn't I do a good job with you? Let's not go there. You were a tiny helpless creature, attached to my chest. Now you stand here, a beautiful woman… A stranger to me. - The sauce is burning. - Let it burn! Are you going to hold a grudge against me forever? This is unfair. You abandoned me! How could a mother leave her daughter? God knows I had no choice. Didn't you notice how your father's wife treated me? Worse than a stray dog. How would I have provided for you? Everyday living was tough. Sewing barely covered the expenses and my parents' medication. I didn't want her to live in deprivation. Besides, in court, her father would have taken her back once she turned 12. You can't continue to blame your mother. Anger eats away at the soul. Aida is your daughter, but you don't own her. It's her life. Let's eat, I'm hungry. There was a man who went round with a donkey cart laden with books. I took a book for a piaster, read it and returned it for half a piaster and took another one. I've read a lot of books, romantic novels that got me dreaming. I long to love like in the novels. There's still a chance. What love, Mother? What's wrong with love? Have you ever fallen in love like in the novels? You see the guy, your heart races, and you get goose bumps. Love is torture. Who's torturing you like this? You're in love, Aida? - Me? - No, my aunt. Tell us all about it! Tell you what? Who is he? Where and how? From when he first appeared on screen, from once upon a time. His name is Ahmed. I had read his books before I met him. I had read everything he wrote. Wow. He writes novels? Like Naguib Mahfouz? Very nice! Go on. A difficult type, a writer. Go on. I felt we were bound to meet. But then I found out he hardly ever leaves his house. Then one day, I was in a bookstore, I looked up as he came through the door. He looked at me. I don't know what came over me. I went out. I escaped. I ran out. You smoke? Yes, occasionally. Go on. A week later, he got my number, I don't know how, and he called me. He asked me out for a coffee. I couldn't believe it. I ran in the street so I wouldn't be late. I found him waiting for me. We sat and talked as if we knew each other since forever. Why didn't you bring him to have a meal with us? Yes, where is he? We didn't see him during our ordeal. He doesn't know. He works all the time. And when he's writing, he doesn't like to be disturbed. Doesn't he love you? What is love good for if you can't find someone to lean on? Sometimes I'm sure he loves me. But most of the time, I feel he only cares about his writing. Writing? How? Isn't he a man? Is he a monk? What do you mean? Your mother is too shy to say that a man needs a woman. Don't you get it? - He offered to marry you? - Yes, then he disappeared. He turned off his phone for a month. And? He came back and said that he loved me, but we couldn't live together, that no woman could understand the life of a writer, and that marriage would ruin our relationship. Your boyfriend is a fake. Boyfriend? Are you sleeping with him? Liar! Why do you say this? Now I get it. This is all a load of bull. You cheapened yourself. - You are naive! - What a shame! You don't understand. He told me he's never loved anyone like he does me. Really? Let me meet him, and I'll show him to you as naked as the day he was born, without all this big talk he fooled you with. What should I say? "Mom wants to meet you"? Yes, tell him Mom is a writer. I can write a novel, and we can show it to him. Enough, please. Calm down and make us some coffee. I've been trying to reach you for a week. I miss you too. How about coffee? Will you call when you're done? Take care of yourself. Bye. He's busy. He said tomorrow or sometime after that. You'll go now. This is the last word. We'll get to the bottom of this story… Tonight. In the dress. Where to, miss? I'm going to visit some relatives here. It's late and the area is unsafe. Go. You're not going to greet me? Didn't I say I had to work tonight? I need to talk to you. I can't wait any longer. Serious stuff. - How do you manage? - What? - To look so beautiful. - Do you like the dress? I like what's inside the dress. I've missed you. You're a liar. This is not fair. You're stingy. Aren't you going to make me coffee? I brought you some beans. Do we have to have coffee? I need to talk to you. I missed you very much. Let me say what I have to say. Okay, have a seat. Let me focus on the coffee. - Do you have any cigarettes? - No. Why didn't you want me to come? Why didn't you answer the phone? Why don't you ask after me? When I'm working, I'm not really myself. You don't understand a thing. I've been homeless for a couple of days now. How? Tell me. I needed you by my side. I lost my house. I lost everything. Now I'm homeless. Why didn't you come? You just said, "why did you come?" I'm sorry, Aida. I'm sorry. Why do you push me away? I only want to be with you. I love you, Ahmed. Why don't you say something? Is it too big a word? - Not too big for you. - What then? No one understands me. Every time I get close to you, you push me away. You get scared. - You don't want to be understood. - What? I have important work, so please, let's get it over with. Why can't we live together? Why can't we get married? I can barely live with myself. Why do you make me feel unworthy? You're one of a kind. If I had to imagine you, you'd be just like how you are. How so? I'm not good with words. I've never loved anyone more than you. Why don't you want us to be together? If we got married, we'd kill each other. We can't live together. Can't you see? I can't see. I don't want to commit to you. I thought we were committed to one another. - Looks like I got it all wrong. - No. Tell me something I can understand. I can hardly bear being me. My mother is pressuring me to get married. I don't want anyone to keep me from my work. When you want Aida, you order her by phone, and she comes home delivered in 45 minutes. -No -I just came to be sure. Aida, you're leaving me? Don't go. Let's talk. Were we together for me to leave you? Aida! It was a misunderstanding. It took a little long, but it's over now. Hello. Where are you? Let's go for a walk. Let's walk home. That's a long way off. Let's walk until we're tired. What a nice dress. Really? It looks very nice on you. What's the matter? What's this you're carrying? Things for the project with my friends. Let me help you, - and you can tell me about it. - No, don't worry! No, first you tell me what the matter is. Please, tell me. Tell me something to make me happy because I am very sad. Anything nice and pretty. Even if it's small, it doesn't matter… Because I'm tired. I'm so tired. - Tell me you're not tired. - I'm not tired. Remember I had told you about a project with my friends? We're almost done. We'll launch a people's radio on the Internet. People from everywhere will talk about it, on land, at sea, in the air. What do you think? This is really beautiful. - Tell me what is wrong. - I am not upset anymore. This is truly beautiful. Dear Ahmed, I came to the seaside. The place that witnessed the birth of our love… To look for consolation. Here, in front of the breaking waves, you looked in my eyes and declared your love to me… What did you do? What happened? I can't talk right now. I'm going to bed. Your sister called. Sherifa called. We'll go tomorrow. Who told you I wanted to go there? Why didn't you ask me? When I'm tired Who can I go to but you? You guide me O God I kneel down And pray to you Love is beautiful. The sea is scary. Enough cowardice! You asked me to forgive my mother. Forgive your sister, is it possible? Everything is possible, but it's difficult, you don't know her. Welcome, come in, come in! I have to go. The driver is waiting. - Take care. - Take care. Two months later, things got better. I got a role in a touring theatre show. I was still staying with my mother who took to swimming like a fish, and still had dreams of moving to the seaside. I still hoped to find a place on a rooftop… like my old place, with plenty of light. Ahmed called several times, but I couldn't answer. Samiha! Hello, Miss Aida! How are you? I miss you and the cute lad. Where is he? Let's celebrate taking off my cast. Get up, lad! Get up, lad! What's the matter? Where's your ID? Get your hands off me. Here's a word about my plight I was scared they would kill it It emerges and the light appears The cactus flower bloomed Take a word to Egypt As long as we're led by intuition... As long as we're led by intuition I was scared they would kill it in a dark alley You didn't tell us, what happened to your pretty face? I was on a secret mission to save our beautiful town from a bunch of baddies. Did you make it, O brave knight? I'm still at it. I haven't come back. Take us with you! Cactus Radio comes to you this morning from the city that never sleeps. The city of cacti, the city victorious. Here is Cairo. The weather today is mild all over the country. We'll leave you with a song, then we'll come back live from Shoun Square in Mahalla, Martyrs' Square in Suez, from Palace Square in Minya, and Saida Nafissa's shrine in Cairo.
