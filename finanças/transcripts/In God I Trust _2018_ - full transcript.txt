- What was that? - Oh my God! What's going on out there? Is everything alright? Racism is not slavery, as President Obama once said. It's not avoiding the use of the word "nigger." Racism is even more subtle than that. It's more nuanced. Racism is the fact that White means normal and that anything else is different. Once you let yourself see it, it's there all the time. Black children learn this when their parent give them "the talk." The system was made for White people, so White people don't have to think about living in it. But we can't point this out. Living every single day with institutionalized racism and then having to argue its very existence is tiring and saddening and angering. Yet, if we express any emotion while talking about it, we're tone policed, told that we're being angry. The reality of thousands of innocent people raped, shot, imprisoned and systemically disenfranchised are less important than the suggestion that a single White person might be complicit in a racist system. This is the country we live in. Millions of Black lives are valued less than a single White person's hurt feelings. Yo, Ben, are you there? What happened? You know what happened. I heard you got canned. They fired me and kept you. Ah, that sucks, man. I mean it could have been from that missing invo a few times there What the hell are you talking about? What has that got to do with me? Well, I'm just saying what I'm hearing. I just want to make sure we're good. Good? I don't even deal with inventory. Now they were trying to mention me and say that I took stuff? Hey, man, I'm just telling you the stuff went missing that's all. Yeah, now they're accusing me of taking inventory. Great. No, it is what it is, dude. I can't-- I can't really say where I'm getting the inside scoop from. Yeah, you can't say where you're getting-- You know it's fucking bullshit, Darcy. Don't even go there, man. You know what, I just need to know if you've got the key to the backdoor. - I need to get that sh-- - Yeah. - Yeah. - Okay, Ben, you need to go back to work and talk to them people. Make sure they know you'll be back tomorrow. Hello? Hello? Did you hear me? I ain't going back there. You have to go back. I ain't going back. - Why not? - They fired me. What? They called me... and they fired me. No, no, no, God, Ben, again? What are we gonna do now? We can't even afford food for Trayvon and you can't pay for your half of the rent again. Again! Bills are piling up. We need to be able to take care of our son and ourselves. I'm doing my best. What the hell are you doing? I don't know. You don't know? You don't know? That's not good enough, Ben. You never know. It's over. You stay in your own country. Terrorist cowards. John! Well, I'm done. Why the fuck you bring that shit everywhere you go? It's cheaper than buying food. It's cheaper than buying--- Well, it fucking stinks, man. Shit. --09:02-- Sheriff man applying for that job. Jesus, man. I don't know. Soon. Well, see why he wouldn't hire you now. Yeah, he will. Democrats still claim that even terror suspects are allowed to purchase guns due to lax U.S. gun laws. The NRA spokeswoman fired back saying the liberal immigration policy is a direct result of domestic terrorism and fake news organizations are taking - You believe that shit? - Law-abiding citizens and their constitutional right to protect themselves. That is the K-97 News. And now here is country Man, if I saw one of those sand niggers around here and he was up to no good, that'd be it. Amen to that. Coming to this country, spread that Muslim bullshit like a fucking wildfire, and then they attack us in our own backyard. Fucking cowards, man. Fucking rights. There aren't any Muslims around here though. Muslims, blacks, Mexicans, whatever, man, it's the same. We're now the minority in our own country. You know what, though, I think things are gonna change around here. It's already starting. ¶ Well I'm on my way You can wish me luck ¶ ¶ Another day Same old stuff ¶ ¶ Road ahead Really looks just fine ¶ ¶ At the end of the day We're on country time ¶ ¶ Some roll the dice With the big city life ¶ ¶ But I don't care 'cause I'm on country time ¶ ¶ Some people go With the speed of light ¶ ¶ But I'm all on my own On country time ¶ ¶ I roam alone Down the country road ¶ ¶ Spinning my wheels Kicking up dirt ¶ ¶ I roam alone Down the country road ¶ ¶ Spinning my wheels... ¶ Can I get a Big Mac and lunch for us?

Don't you guys have somewhere to be? Yeah. Yeah, he's gonna go talk to sheriff man about that job soon, right? Hey, so you're meeting my dad tomorrow? Yeah. Good. Better get in his good books soon or else... Or else what? Just go, be a nice guy, make him happy, so I don't have to hear about it later. In the palm of my hands, babe. In the palm of my hands. Ben, I'm not playing these games anymore. I just can't do it. We've talked about this too many times and I've tried calling you and you're not answering. I'm taking Trayvon to my parents. It's never gonna change. I'm done with it. I'm done with all of this. What the fuck? Thank you, bro. Thanks for stopping, man. Where are you headed? I got a gig in the next town up ahead. Well as you could take me, bro, it's cool. I'll drop you there, man, get in. Thank you, bro. Appreciate it. Woo! It's cold. Uh! Shit's cold, right. I don't know what's up with this weather. Hot, cold. Crazy, right? I'm B. Ben. B and Ben. BB King, greatest blues guitar play of all time, man. Hey, man, you mind if I turn the radio on?

But you know it ain't gonna help you none. See, you wanna do the right thing. But all of this self-righteous shit just gets built up inside. I know, I've been there. Hey man, look. I ain't in the mood to be having no conversation with you, alright? Well, I know I talk too much, man. Talk too much. I'll tell you what, bro, I'll buy you food and a beer at the next stop. This gig I'm playing, man, pretty sweet big. No, thanks. Listen, man, it's the least I can do for you helping me out, doing me a solid.

It's five bucks. Thanks. - Thank you. - Thanks. Have a good one. Thanks. Let's roll. Really? Hey, pal. How goes it? Good. I'm about 30 minutes away. Fantastic. We're all settled here. We'll see you soon. Looking forward to it. How long has it been? Seven years? I think so. Yes. Good to finally see you. You, too. Here he is. Hi, Michael. Hi, Barbara You're looking good. Thank you. How was the drive? Nice. I forgot what it was like to take a road trip. Oh, good. Well, why don't we let you take your bag up and you can join us for some wine. - Okay. - Your room is just right up there. Oh, great. Thank you. You're welcome. We'll see you in a minute. We have plenty-- we have plenty more in the fridge too. Hi, guys. Hey. Have a seat. Care for some red? That would be perfect. Thanks. - So... - Delicious. What have you been up to lately? Well, you know, mostly keeping busy with work. And how is that going? - Thank you. - You're welcome. Still teaching history of art and architecture? I'm actually teaching economics now. - Wow. - Yeah. That's a big change. What are you specializing in? Political economy and international trade. - Oh. - Still at Stanford, right? That's right. How about you two? How's business going? Good. Not a lot has changed really. Putting in less hours at the firm. We can run things from home a little bit more now. So we have more time to travel. Mm-hmm. More time for family. Been nice. Well, cheers to that. Cheers to that. So is there a special someone in your life, Michael? Hmm, no, not at the moment. Oh, hey, come, join. You remember Michael, right? Uh, yeah. Hi. Hi. Mya's in her second year at Georgetown. She's going to be able to run the company in no time. Alright, that's wishful thinking on my part. Hey, doesn't Amanda go to Stanford? - Uh, yeah, she does. - Yeah, that's right. And when you were there over the summer, did you get to check out the campus? Yeah, it's really nice. So, Michael, whatever happened to that girl that you were seeing? Isabella. We still keep in touch. You were seeing each other for a long time, no? Few years, yeah. What happened? She wanted kids? She's doing just fine. Well, you do want to get married and have kids one day though, right? Whoa, easy on the poor guy, he just got here. It's okay, it's fine. I guess anything can happen. I'm sure if the right woman comes along you'll be standing right next to her at the aisle one day. Well, right now I'm just enjoying the single life. And you've always been that way. So what made you decide to come this way after all these years? Well, that's just it, isn't it? Time goes by and well before you know it, it can be very unforgiving. This doesn't stop, does it? We keep getting older and time just doesn't give a damn. I know it does not. Except for Mya here. Time's certainly on your side. I'm okay. Although it does depend what we do with our time though, doesn't it? It certainly doesn't stop when the clock stops ticking. How so? In the physical sense, I mean, of course, our bodies die, eventually, but our souls never die, we carry on and we either go up there or to the other place. Hmm. I guess we never really do know, do we? Hmm. So, no kids, not into marriage, would you say you're a religious man, Michael? You don't have to answer that. No, I'm not. Okay. I don't think Michael shares the same views on this one, honey. That's okay. We don't have to all be on the same page at the same time. True. Doesn't one get lonely without God in their life though? I suppose if you believed in God or religion, that could be true, yes. Well, even if you don't believe in Him, God does believe in you. Alright, I think I hear God telling us to pick a new topic. I think people spend too much time and energy on religion and not enough time on practical common sense. One can never spend too much time with God, honey. It's our belief in God that keeps us safe and strong. Yeah, unless, of course, you don't believe in God or religion. And faith is what gives us a moral compass which gives us peace and the freedom to do the right thing without worrying about what some people think. In fact, it's true believers who are more likely to do the right thing and be good citizens, right? I believe quite the opposite actually. Charity, feeding the poor, providing hope for those who have none. We can still do all those things without believing in fairy tales. No, come on, Michael. You can't compare believing in God to believing in fairy tales. If you were raised in India or let's-- I don't know, say Syria, would you believe in the Bible? I don't know, I wasn't raised there. The point is we believe what our parents teach us, what we were taught as children. That's a poor way to look at God, though, and religion. You should read the Bible. You might learn something. It might enlighten you. The world is so connected nowadays it's easy to see what's going on. Religion is the cause of way too many problems. It's all there, it's written in the scripture. It's there to guide us on our journeys. I have read the Bible, by the way, and we really don't believe it should be taken literally, do we? Of course, it's God's Word to us, to the world. But that's exactly what radical Islamists feel. Oh, no, no, no, they don't believe in God, they believe in pure evil. No, they believe like you do, that certain passages in their book should be taken literally. The Bible as we know it cannot be compared to what those uncivilized, uneducated people call a religion. That would be ridiculous. If a woman has sex before she is married, the men in the city have the right to stone her to death? No. And what did Jesus say when He was presented with the adulterer before the men were going to stone her? He said let he who is without sin cast the first stone. That's right. But if this Bible is the perfect book, written by the perfect being, God, then why is it in there to begin with? These are things that non-believers try to argue to create contradictions in the Bible. If we're meant to take the Bible literally, then why did Jesus come down after to correct God, who is His dad, who is Himself? You have to read both the Old Testament and the New Testament. And we know God works in mysterious ways. Some of the most dangerous words ever spoken. Wow. Michael, I didn't know you're so into religion. No, I'm not. I just like to consider myself a simple common sense kind of guy. The most dangerous words ever spoken. James, would you mind getting us another bottle of wine? Allow me, please. Saved by the bell, huh. Well, I'm just trying to make myself useful. I'm just gonna make sure he doesn't steal something. You do that, honey. And the nerve of him in our home. I told you not to bring up religion around Michael. He's always been this way. So what are we doing? Are we hiding what's right now because he's your college buddy? I know, I'm on your side. But we can't force people to share the same values that we have. Mya and I can take care of this. Let's have a drink in the games room, Michael. So when did you start hating on your faith? Hating? Okay, I don't know what you're talking about. Cut the bullshit. You're taking Michael's side and he's an atheist. I'm not taking anyone's side. I believe what I believe. You've gone to church your whole life, you go to Georgetown, for crying out loud, and now you're acting like you've never heard of any of this. What's going on with you? I grew up, I got educated. Honestly, mom, I stopped believing in religion years ago. Well, this is the first I've heard of it. And the way you were talking at the table is so disappointing. Yeah, I kept it from you because I knew it'd be an issue with you and dad. Michael's wrong and so are you. Okay. Well, we all have our own opinions. Oh, that's ridiculous. Why? 'Cause I don't agree with you? Okay, let me tell you something. When the day comes when you really need help, you know you'll pray to God, right? And it's always the naysayers who, when heaven forbid something does go wrong, there they are asking for His help. And they'd better hope that He still has faith in them because that time will come. I'm not sure what this has to do with anything. I guess I'll be judged when that day comes. Listen, I'm sorry about that in there. I hope it-- I didn't come off too harsh. Don't worry about it. Look, I knew it was coming. Just glad that we got over it so quickly. And she'll get over it. I'm glad you're here. I know I sound like a broken record but... ...it's been way too long. I was surprised that you actually reached out to me. Well, we get so preoccupied with work and life and next thing you know, seven years passes by. Wow. Seven years. Holy smokes. You knowm the last time I saw you, Mya was just a kid. Now she's a full-grown woman. She's got her own life. It's just amazing. She's a very beautiful woman, indeed. You're very lucky. Well, as they say, at least I did something right. That's for damn sure. Listen, there's something I wanted to talk to you about. Yeah. Sure. What is it? James! Hold that thought. I need you to get more stuff from the store for dinner. Oh, I can get whatever we need. No, no, you relax, enjoy yourself. No, I insist. Besides, I like to drive. Well, I'll write you a list. I'll help. I can go with him. No, you don't have to do that. I want to. Alright, Michael. Mind if Mya helps out? Okay, sure. Yeah. I'll go get you some cash. No, no, I'll take care of it. I'm just getting my coat. - Mya, you know where to find it? - Yeah. Take your time, no rush. Can you pull over? Pull over? Why? Can you-- do you mind just pulling over? Everything alright? That was nice. Couldn't resist. Good deal. You? No. No, my parents. Right. I did try. My mom is so mad. I know. It's not very good for our cause, is it? No. No, it's fine. It's okay. We will tell them when we get back. Okay. It's the right thing to do. Yeah. Just need a few more drinks first. Yes. Okay, I have an idea. What's that? Yo, you alright? Can I ask you a question, man? Where are you going? What are you running from, bro? You didn't even notice them back there, did you? Notice what? Those two racist hit motherfuckers, man. Man, listen, I'm a nigger playing rock n' roll in a country bar. You think I didn't notice that shit? You think I'd let these racist motherfuckers get me down? You know what gets me through? My music. My music brings me up, it keeps me high, it keeps my mind going in a positive way. You know what I'm saying? Positivity. Listen, this is gonna be my second time offer, bro. I'm gonna buy you a beer. We're gonna eat some food and you gonna be entertained by, probably, one of the greatest musicians of all time, yeah, it's me. Look man, I told you I'm not stopping, alright? So this is where I would come to meet the nice boys. Wow. - Your old hangout. - Yeah. Thought we could use a temporary break. Sounds good. I should have brought my cowboy hat. Where do you wanna sit? Let's go back there. Okay. - Yeah, it looks good. - Yeah. How do you feel about prolonging the inevitable just for a couple days or so? Yes, please. You know what we need? We need beers. - Okay? - Yes. Okay. I'll be right back. - Hey. - How is it going? - Good. - What can I get you? Just a couple of beers would do. I don't know. Buy a new home and tell them. We're about to fucking --41:03--. Yeah, just go ahead. Hey, ah... G-minor. A little mid-tempo feel. What the fuck is this? Move it upward. Howdy folks? I'm B. And that don't stand for "black." Well, that usually goes over well. I'm gonna do a little song. This song is about a girl. ¶ I've seen this place before ¶ ¶ We've been Through these roads before ¶ ¶ So fast time goes by ¶ ¶ I can hardly see ¶ ¶ Enough is all I need ¶ ¶ Enough is all I want ¶ ¶ Enough is all I need ¶ ¶ Enough is all I want ¶ ¶ When I'm with you ¶ He's amazing. ¶ Sometimes the miles Keep bid away ¶ ¶ But you're still Still close to me ¶ ¶ The simple things that come ¶ ¶ That come around ¶ ¶ Brings me back here again ¶ ¶ Enough is all I need ¶ ¶ Enough is all I want ¶ ¶ Enough is all I need ¶ ¶ Enough is all I want ¶ ¶ When I'm with you ¶ ¶ When I'm with you ¶ Fuck this shit, man. ¶ When I'm with you ¶ ¶ When I'm with you ¶ ¶ When I'm with you ¶ ¶ When I'm with you ¶ ¶ I can't see you But I know you're there ¶ ¶ I can't, I can't feel you But I know you're there ¶ ¶ I can, I can hardly see you ¶ ¶ Oh, but I know you're there ¶ ¶ I can't, I can't feel you But I know you're there ¶ ¶ I can't see you But I know you're there ¶ ¶ I can't feel oohhh ¶ ¶ I can't see oohhh ¶ ¶ Won't feel you ¶ ¶ I won't see you again ¶ Whoo! Yeah! Really good. Hey, come on, man. Are you serious? - Jesus. - Sing fucking country. Knock it off, man. Damn, that was good, brother. - Thank you. Whoo! Yo, you okay? Yeah. Yo! Yo, where you going? Yo, yo. Come on, man. Chill. Let's finish the fucking drink. Come on, bro. So what'd you think? It was good. It was better than good, man. Yeah, I go from one town like this to another, man, doing my thing. Yeah, man, whatever you gotta do, man. I do it for free. Get a little green in my pocket, perform for these crazy-ass white folks sometimes. Thought this was gonna be a tough crowd tonight. I thought you said you don't let that shit bother you. No, thick-skinned brother. Black skin. Yo, I do two sets, then I'm done, man. Should stay for the second set, man. I'm gonna try out some new tunes on these guys. Nah, no thanks, man. But I appreciate the beer, though, man. Thanks. Man, come on, bro. Give you a chance to chill, man, just take a load off, calm down for a minute. I am getting kind of hungry, so - I guess I could stay for the - Yeah, what will you drink? Fuck this shit, I ain't staying. You can't sleep either? No. You? Staring at the ceiling all night. What are you doing? This bed is so squeaky. Okay. You should probably go back to your room. Okay. Go away. I am going back to my old room. What are you thinking about? - Like right now? - Yeah. I'm thinking about how Barbara and James are gonna take it. That's not what I'm thinking about. What are you thinking about? What do you think of me? What do you mean? When you think about me, what do you think about? I think about how good you make me feel, happy, how I love spending time with you. It's not what I think about. What do you think about? I think about your hand, your touch, your eyes and the way you smell. Smell? Okay. You don't think of me the same way. How do you know you love me? - 'Cause I do. - How do you know? That's how you make me feel inside. Inside, huh? Inside what? - In my heart. - Oh, no. What would you do if I died? - Okay, now you're being ridiculous. - Would you cry? Of course, I would cry, I would be very upset. How do you know? 'Cause I love you. I think you'd trade me in for a younger model. I actually don't think that's possible. Well, how would you feel if I died? I would cry. And then, of course, I would... you know, try to trade in for a younger model. Now that I believe. What do you like about me? I told you I like everything about you. Like what specifically? I like your smile. I like the way you talk. Like a young naive girl? No, you're more mature than most people I know. Like your students, the only people you hang around? No, like most people I know in general. Okay. So, you think I'm mature and you like the way I talk. Is that enough? I said I like everything about you. You are special for me. You are to me. - I like your lips. - What are you doing? What are you doing? No, stop. - I like your neck. - Stop. Sicko, stop it. Stop! Sshhh. Keep it down. What's the matter with you? I like your neck. Stop it. So what do you do for work? I used to drive a company truck. Used to? I got fired, for a white dude. Wow. That never happens. Not gonna believe you. You got a girl back from you're from? I did. But she left. Is that before or after you lost your job? Today. Man, that's some kicking in the ass while you're down type of shit, man. Don't worry about her, bro. A girl leave you at a time like this, brother, she not really worth anything. I mean, that's what I think. She's worth it, man. You know, when we're happy, we wake up and life is so good. But when we're sad, shit not working out, you won't even want to get out of bed. It's like an ocean wave or some shit. You ride the wave. But the wave comes crashing down and you fall along and you tread for a minute and then you catch the next wave. And you-- you just fell off the way, brother. Just got to catch the next one. Damn. Man, do you always talk like this when you're high? It's just fucking killing my buzz, goddamn. I philosophize when I'm high. Welcome to the school of B. Yeah, yeah, that's you. Fuck you, man. Oh... B! Hey yo, B! B! Oh, shit. Shit. Oh, fuck! Come on. Hi. Hi. Good morning. - Coffee? - Yeah, perhaps some. What are you reading? The news. Good morning. Good morning. How did everybody sleep? Good. Well, thank you. So, what's on the agenda for today? Uh, I actually was gonna ask you the same thing. What are the options? Well, we could head into town, we could check out the old shops. Honey? I want you to leave. Hey, that's not funny. She doesn't mean that. I want you to leave. - Honey - Right now. - Excuse me, did I say something? - Don't speak. Just get your things and get out of my house. Mom, what is wrong with you? We apologize for this, Michael. - Enough. I want you to get your things and get out. And I want you to go with him. What has gotten into you? Look, enough of this nonsense. No, it's okay. I think I understand. I just saw you. I saw both of you! Mya? Yeah, okay, Michael and I are seeing each other, so fucking what? James. I wanted to talk to you about it. Get out and don't you come back. I'm sorry. What the hell is going on? Your daughter has lost her faith. Everything good, John? Define good. I'll have some more coffee, Deb. Yeah. Thanks. We stopped by the store, said hi to Sam. - How is she? - Just good. Coffees? - Yeah. - Yeah. Can I have a slice of that apple pie, too? Okey-dokey. No cream, right? Yourself? No, I'm alright. Mm-hmm. Well, the scrubs are out, you're not working today? Scrubs? Yeah, your work clothes. Is that scrubs? I just meant your uniform. Well, if that's what you meant, why'd you say scrubs? I don't know, just noticed you don't have them, is all. I was just wondering if you were working today or not. Starting late, working late. I'm assuming you'll be with Sam after she gets off work. Yeah. I'm picking her up. How's the house coming? It's good. We're almost done. Almost done? Yeah, just a couple more things to the roof. What things are those? - Just shingles and stuff. Putting shingles on this week? Oh, no, I got to replace some wood on the frame first. So you're gonna replace some wood on the frame of the house first? Yeah. And once that is done, we can get the shingles on. You have the wood ready? No, not yet, just still trying to find the right type and stuff. Stuff? What stuff? Ah, well, just I got a measure where the old wood was and--- then find the new stuff and... yeah, we'll just go out there and get it done, man. Have you done the measurement? Not yet. Why not? Just looking for somebody to do that. You can't do it yourself? Who have you called? I haven't called anyone yet. But I'm gonna do that real soon. Why haven't you called anyone yet? I don't know, I just got busy with all the other stuff. Stuff? What are you talking about? I'm gonna get the shingles. - And the wood. - Yeah, and the wood. You just said seconds ago that you needed to find a guy to measure the frame first, right? So you're not putting on shingles or buying new wood yet, correct? Well, no, but... I'm gonna get someone to measure that frame. Who are you gonna get? An old guy. Billy. Now that you're here, you two might as well learn something. You can leave our shit alone. Man, someone wanna take that motherfucker out. That's the world we live in. Well, thanks to some fucking nigger. Terrorists run around here and they want to take away our guns. They aren't getting mine, that's for damn sure. Did you vote? Shit's rigged. Is that what you think? Yeah. To be a man, you're gonna step up and do the work. We're in a fight here. It's us versus them. And better believe me, they got the numbers. So what are we gonna do to overcome them? Can I get you guys anything else? We're all good. What's your plans with Sam? What do you mean? Long run, planning on marriage, family? Yeah, we want to. So what's the plan? Well, I'm-- I'm-- I'm just gonna-- just gonna work on the house and... yeah, maybe we plan for kids one day. Well, Sam will be a good mother, no doubt about that, but... how would you be a good father? Well, I'm gonna do whatever it takes. I'm gonna work real hard and save up and all that stuff. That's the easy part. You've gotta get your shit together. It's the things you do as a man to protect your family, to protect what you believe in, simple things like you vote when it's time to vote. You two must have things to do. Make sure you two have food in the fridge. Take it, buy something for Sam. Appreciate it. You're welcome. Excellent pie and coffee. Not a problem. Deb, check please. You bet. Thank fuck, that's done. Deb... showing her titties once again. I took her out last week. Are we going? Yeah, wouldn't start. I told you. I traded it in. Yes, yes, I had to use the credit card, yes. Or else I'll be stuck. What do you want me to do? What does he got to do with it? You can't just take my son. He's my son, too. I'm not a fucking loser. I don't care! I don't care anymore! Can I help you, Sir? Yeah. Looking for a gun. Well, what kind of gun you're looking for? Something cheap. Well, it kind of depends on what you need it for, I guess. That one. The Cobra 380. Well, that's cheap, alright. Hundred and thirty bucks. It's got a 3.5-inch-long barrel, 5.4-inch overall length, weighs about twenty-two ounces, I'd say, features fixed sights, single-action trigger, and she holds five rounds. You're welcome to pick it up if you like. You know shooting the Cobra 380, it's not all that bad. It's similar, I'd say, to a high point, meaning it works, but, I'm not gonna pass it on down to my kids, that's for sure. What do you say, Sir? I'll take it. Alright, I just need your driver's license. You need ammo? Yeah. Standard 380 ammo. Are we good? Yeah, I just need you to-- need you to sign the bottom of this form and finish off. And how would you like to pay, Sir? Great. How's the day, Roger? Not too bad. Yourself? Just started. Okay, you are good to go. Let me get you a case for that. Okay. There you go. Have a good day. Something odd about that one. Background checked out? Oh, yeah. Well, that's his right. Yeah, yeah. What can I get you today, Chief? I'm gonna need some Gold Dots. Gold Dots. Yeah, got them. Just give me second. Gold Dots. Alright. I'm really sorry. What for? You did absolutely nothing wrong. Who's putting you through this? We tried to do the right thing. Didn't work out. I've never seen her that upset. She's gonna be fine. It's just-- it's gonna take a little time, is all. Hey. We have nothing but time, right? Hi, how we doing? Want that coffee now? Yes, please. Two, please. Thank you. You okay? You? Shaky. You there? Huh? You there? I need to know. I need to know, I can't feel you. Son, I can't feel you. Where are you? Where are you at this moment? At this second, where are you? Hello. Ben! Jesus Christ, answer your goddamn phone. I can hear you-- You did it again, huh? Just like your goddamn father. What now, huh? I'm gonna have to take care your family? Ah, your girl go and get another job while I take care of your kids? Hell, no. I ain't playing games, Ben. You hear me? Answer! You need to get your shit together. You need to be like your brother Andre and not like your goddamn father. I give up. Can we get you something? Coffee. You need to get here quick. Something is not right. There's a black guy in the diner, he's got a gun. Calm down. Who-- who has a gun? Just get here quick. I'll be right there. Police! Stop! Stop! - Oh my God! - What is that? Jesus. Mya? Hey, hey. What's going on? No, wait a second. Wait a second. It's okay. Just-- just hold on. Can somebody, please, call an ambulance? No, no. Get some help! What did you do? Call an ambulance! It's okay. Is somebody gonna fucking help me? So, did you talk to my dad about working for him or? We talked about pretty much everything, so. Okay, but did you talk to him specifically about working? No, not exactly that way. He jumped down my throat before I even opened my mouth. Yeah, okay. Tired of that old man's bullshit anyway. Yeah, he's definitely the problem here, not you. You think I got something I got to prove to him? I'm sure he loved the shaved head, too. You know what, sweetheart? He can kiss my white ass. And you can too. If y'all don't like it, you can both fuck off. You know what, fuck it, I don't even fucking care anymore. You do whatever the fuck you want. Yeah, that's right, I'll do whatever the fuck I want - whenever the fuck I want. - Yep. Fuck! I mean-- I didn't mean to do that.
