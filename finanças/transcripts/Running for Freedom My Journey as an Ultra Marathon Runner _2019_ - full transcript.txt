- Oh my God! - First of all, our team is, we call it team 81, for this 2018 Badwater. My crew is, first my crew chief is Peachy Poso. She has a stellar athlete. She run more than 40 marathons and ultra marathons. And she finished two Boston marathons in a row. And, she do reverse triathlons. My second crew is Ibar, he crewed for me two years ago, from a Lone Pine to Whitney Portal. And, he's also stellar athlete. He runs lots of ultra marathons and marathons as well. And, last but not the least, Steve Gerschultz. He's a doctor, in profession. So he's also, he runs like more than 50 marathons. He do a lot of triathlons and do ultras as well. And, he's a doctor so he's gonna take care of me. Usually, if you run the Badwater, you run like every two miles, they do like leapfrog. So, they give me all the nutrition, food, water, make sure I have everything. And then now, the crews also one of the crews can be a pacer too. They crew from me after 42 miles, and the rest to the finish. What is a pacer? - Actually, it's like, it's not really a pacer because you cannot run side by side. They have to run behind the runner. So they usually, they check on me like if I'm doing good and then what I need, then I have somebody to talk with. Why do you like running? - Oh, there's a lot of reasons. One is, it's fun. Number two is, for health reasons. Number three is a camaraderie among other runners. And probably for is a runcation. You know what I mean? Like you go to other places, you are sign up for a race and then you, at the same time you are in vacation. So why do you run the Badwater? This'll be your fifth time running Badwater. - Unfortunately my fifth time, because it's a love and hate relationship. By the way, I mean, why do I run Badwater? Because it's a difficult race and it's a very scenic race. It's very nice out in Death Valley. - You know, the good part is, I'd say that's about 65 right now. What's your resting heart rate normally? - It should be in around 45. - Oh 45, it heats up and It's hot out here, so. - Yeah. - It's probably 60 to 65 right now. It's still fit, that'll work. All right, take a listen to your lungs and your heart. Make sure that, deep breath there. Deep breath. Right here. Right here. That's great, you got good lung capacity. Yeah. - Okay. - That's good. - Take a listen to your heart here. No arrhythmias. - All right. - Yeah, yeah. I think you're good to go here. - Okay. Thank you so much. - Go get them. Let's go. No, I'm just fan, I drove all the way from Texas just to come-- Did you really? - Yeah. - Seriously. Wow! - Wow! Yeah, yeah. Well this sure is. - If I had like my car or my bike. - 2009, like I happened to hike from something like 5:30 No, I lost an inch, I am 5-- Like actually do you hike? I'm like the shortest, right? One five zero. I'm supposed to be 149. Yeah but, it's the elevation. - Tell me reaction? Yeah that's fine, that's fine. - All right. Are you okay? - I think I'm okay. Yeah. - I think you'll find out. - So I did-- - I'm just gonna throw up. I'm gonna need it. - No. That's why I have Tums, I have Peptbismal you're covered. Let's get everybody down on the Badwater sign for photographs-- - I think I'm gonna need my vest now. Yes. Number 34 are you here? Number 34, you need to check in yourself, get your and get weighed. 34! Number 34. 34 now! - So you need your beep lights in a minute, right? - Make sure you see me, if I can't see your face. - I want you guys to step back a little bit, you guys step back a little bit to be a little freer. All right, do we have any more runners coming down? Any other runners? Lets go over the roster real quick. I'll make sure we're all accounted for. Eight o'clock Here we are 2018, Badwater 135, the world hottest footrace, welcome to the event everybody. Watch the pole, watch the pole. Watch the pole, watch the pole. Thank you. - Watch the pole, all right, all right, all right. - You good? Empty. - You still got? It's empty, nothing. - Empty? You need one? - I have nothing. - Okay. - Okay. - Only the water that he don't have one? Yes, he doesn't have anything. Any, no nothing. - He finished those? - Yes, yeah. - There you go. Now we go driving. No, no, no, we're going to drive 'cause it's way to far. - All right then, whoever-- He's too fast. - Yeah, I know. Come on, come on, come on, go. I have nothing - Rj. - Cross cross cross. - Cross, cross. How come I cannot open this? - Thank you - Okay. He said that they don't go too far he needs lots of water. Yeah, make them again. - You know what you can do later on, you can just go bring the whole tray. You know, and then you can just clean this one. Okay. That's good. Right there. - Gotcha. I've put this one over here the 10, 12. That's like every two hours for his BO2 Max and salt. So every time we finish it, we'll just cross it so we know if we give it or not. - Okay that's fine all right. Okay, now I think we can go. - Okay. - You wanna sit? You want a chair? - It's all ice. - It's all ice. - Again? - Yeah. And then this one is no ice. Why is my nose is itching? - Your nose, it's probably, it's because its dry. - It's dry? 'Cause it's dry? Maybe? Yeah. - My arm, it's so sticky. - Water? - Water yeah. - Yeah, I'm gonna drink water. A lot. - Yeah, you need a new one of these? - There's a lots of water right here. - Yeah, can you put more water? - More water? Lots of water right here. - Yeah that's CarboPro. - You've wet this. Stick it with a. Be careful not to wet your. Shoes. - Shoes. - I'm okay now. We're almost, like four miles. - Where to for almost? - To a Furnace Creek. - Five more. - No five more, five more. Five more - five more. We're 12 right, yeah five more miles. We are 12 right now. - Are you okay? Are you okay? - Yeah. You need some gel? No you haven't, okay. - I dint take any gel. But I didn't take anything. Okay you're good. - You got gel. - You're good? You're good. - All right. - All right. Have fun. - So he wants ice on this one. - Just ice he says? Just ice, yeah. - Pretty much every strenuous workout, I've probably been working out fairly seriously, 10, 15 years. And each strenuous workout does give you, in my personal experience, a high that lasts usually about 24 hours. And, basically you feel good during that time. And it's the same effect that you get with drugs and many other areas. This has a beneficial effect because it can have you continued to want to exercise, at times when you would rather do other things. - It's my therapy It makes me feels calmer after a run and you go see my, like, even on my fridge, it's like, running is cheaper. What do you call that one? Cheaper therapy, something like that, I forgot the word. But yeah, it, it makes you more calmer after the run. - Oh, finishing the race, It's just tough, you know. I've been running with Gerald, most of the races. Probably with three of my a hundred miler. Running with him. But this one is just really different. You know, the heat, the humidity. It's just record breaking. So, and I could feel that Gerald is worried as well, but I have no doubt that he can finish it. There was no time when you were thinking, "Oh oh, we're gonna DNF?" - No, no way. It's just being around with Gerald all the time. I kind of know that, you know, it's Gerald, there's no DNA for quitting. Just probably drag Gerald to the finish line or feet crawling. But that's how Gerald is, you know? - Well, Gerald Tabios was really impressed when he finished his first Badwater 135. Basically, well I can say he is the first Filipino, one of the first few Filipinos so, who finished this. And I have written an article wherein I really recognize him as the first back to back. That means for two consecutive years, he was able to finish the Badwater 135. And I was really impressed about his performance in those two consecutive races. - Gerald as a runner, he's very cool. I mean, I don't know how he trains, like or how we train for the Badwater, because I know he has a full time job also like me. So me I trained after office if I have one or two hours, and I'll just training the treadmill in the gym. Gerald is very focused, dedicated and he's really dedicated runner. He's a cool runner for me. Very nice, very sweet person. And then he's a good friend of mine also. Actually we're kababayans, because I also, my family, some of my relatives stay in Bukidnon. Also Visaya. So you are also Visaya? - Yes, yes, I can understand a few words, but I don't speak the dialect. - Yes so like, inside oven, you're blowing road side, to water night, even at night. How do you survive that? - I heat train, I train for it. The only way. I always talk to a lot of people, who like past champions who are my friends, and they told me just do heat training, heat training, continued training. Do sauna, if you can go to the race itself, train on the course or go to Palm Springs which I did. Like I frequent Palm Springs every Friday. Is it dangerous? - It is. It is very special, like hot. That's just killing you, It's getting into your skin. And-- - I've been to the Philippines. I ran the Bataan Death March. It's hot and humid, but this is a different heat 'cause it's penetrating into your skin. All right, good job. - I need the spray. The dry spray? - Yeah, this. It's been a while. Mutual Runner. - Oops oh my God. It's good. - Nice one some lube. - Lube. It's like, what lube? - I think I need like bandana. - You need banana now? - No, the bandana. - A bandana? I thought you said banana. I'm not gonna put much, is this better? - Yeah it's good. It's cold. - Yeah 'cause this is already warm. It's starting to get cold too. - Are we like five miles awy? Yes. But I will stay five miles, if five miles - Give me like two minutes. Yeah. - Can I have that water. You want some lube or you're good? - I think I'm good, you think? I have CarboPro right? Yep you do. More? - It's the ice. I think you got a haircut just for this. - What is that? You got a haircut 'cause it's short in the back a little. You need a comb? I think I'm good now, I'm just gonna. Just for this I - I'm gonna check my system if it's working. I feel cold when I stop. - Yes of course, 'cause it's the. That's why I don't want you to like, wear like too much of ice. Yeah, but right now you're fine. - I'll see you in 15. 15. And he is going. This is uphill. Your going uphill here. - Is it uphill? Yeah. - That's why my muscles are like. - Yeah, you can look down and see their cars down there. - What's the elevation now? It's sea level. More than Probably a couple hundred up,. - Oh my God, I just feel like, I want to close my eyes. Take a rest. - Can I get some water? - You want this jug to put your thing? To put your feet up. - Is there like a thing that can make me up? - Caffeine. - What is that? No to make me up. Awake you up? Sun's gonna rise in about half hour. - Yeah yeah, usually when sun rises. Can you help him up please? - Is there like a Redbull or? Yeah, I think this is good. - Couple of sips later, yeah. - Yeah. And then I just wanna need anew sets of water. Oops! - What happened? - Nothing. - You wet your self? You want this one? - This is, it's not empty yet, but you can put some ice. Yeah ice. - I wanna go now. Okay. I'll see ya'. I wanna get light. - Good job. - Okay. One more there. - One more stop and then. And them we'll be there at Stovepipe. Stovepipe. You want some massage? - Oh no, look, get me some water. Oh my God, I just love it here. I like it too, it's a comfortable chair. - Everything becomes awesome. I love this. Oh, maybe bandana, right? - Have this stuff too. - I fee like a king. Not a princess? - Three of those, start there. - I'm gonna be whining soon. Like, He's like, wait, let me get the button and hit your head. Or should I go say what June said? - So where's that musket sun, it's coming out right? You want me to take that? - Less than a mile. - Almost there. - I can see the cars, be right there. - They are all lined up back there, yeah? - Yeah. - You're doing well. Yeah sun comes up every half hour. - It's all good. - Once the sun comes up-- I pee like every one and a half mile. - Yeah, yeah, that's plenty, yeah, you're well hydrated. - One more stop and then the next one is Stovepipe right? - Yep - exactly. Good job. - Thank you. Even though we might enough-- And I'll just fill them in there. - I think I'm gonna change. I'm gonna change long sleeves. Long sleeve okay. Pit stop. It's too early for the time. - And then the blinky lights. - Nelson had a black and blinky light, right? - Yeah. - Yeah. - I need you to do something, you want the new one with that one? - Yeah. - So we're gonna walk. - Okay. Get it too fast. Oh my God. - No, no, towel first. - I need towel? - That towel just like here. - All right. - Do I need hat now? - Well you could if you want. But, it's still-- - Yeah, maybe the next stop, right? - Yeah. - You want that hat? - Yeah later when the sun lights up. - Are you gonna wear this one again? - Yeah, just dried it out. - I should store it. - Thank you. - What do you call it? - Well, my friend Peachy has a saying on her refrigerator. Running is cheaper than therapy. And, it's probably due to these endorphins that make you feel good. It also, physiologically just releases, much of the stress that can accumulate during the day. It's recommended as most people probably know 20, 30 minutes of exercise at least several times a week. And that amount will release the stress that accumulates and be very beneficial and helpful. You'll asleep better, you'll eat healthier foods. You'll just feel better about yourself. Is it better than, pills prescribed by doctor? - Oh, absolutely. Not only are you getting the neural effects, you're also getting the cardiovascular effects as well. So your heart muscle is strengthening, your lungs are increasing in capacity. So there's many beneficial effects to exercise. You don't need to run 135 miles to get this effect, probably a couple of hours a week is all you need. But running 135 certainly is going to increase those effects and is beneficial. - Oh, a lot. Without the crew, I would say maybe I'm not so sure If it's possible, or if they allow it, to finish one 35 without a crew. 'Cause you have to have someone to deal with your nutrition, make sure that you have a proper nutrition that you're hydrated enough. And plus, you know, if you're a sleepy, what will you do if you're gonna just like take a cat nap or you need to just like sleep the whole hour. So there's a lot that needs to be done by the crew. - So I was introduced running like five years ago. I was wearing my basketball shorts and my basketball shoes running. I got an injury because it's not the proper way of running. But after that, this is just like, I love the sport, you know, it's, you know, when you are working, especially in New York, it's very you know, lots of stress in the work. So when you're running, it's like you are alone. You can think of the things, you know, work, family. But just kind of distressing, you know, it's you alone so, that's how I love the sport running. So we're giving him some electrolytes. - Yeah, we're gonna give him some electrolytes and some other supplements called B2O Max, which is a bronchial vasodilator. So it helps get a little bit more blood flow into the lungs. And the electrolytes. - So he's been taking that. And the electrolytes, they are essential to having the body work correctly. So we're giving mainly potassium sodium, calcium. A couple other electrolytes that were giving and that's so that the cells function optimally. When you are running in this kind of heat, you're losing a lot of water and a lot of electrolytes. So both of them, you have to replace. What's the danger of losing electrolytes? - If you lose too much electrolytes, and then you replace it with just water, you can get hyponatremia, which is a dilution of the sodium. And actually it can be deadly. So that's one thing you really wanna avoid. That's why electrolytes with this type of exertion are very important. What is the intervals in the intake of electrolytes? - We're going every hour. So two, what we're giving is something called endurolytes, which is a supplement. It's got about six different electrolytes in it. We're giving two of those every hour. All throughout the race. - Throughout the race yeah. And then in addition, he's hydrating of course, it's a water and sugar mixture, something called CarboPro, which is a complex carbohydrate. That's the fuel? - That's a fuel, yes. Equally important. All right. - He's gonna sit. He's gonna sit, okay. - On the shady one. Can you finish this. Just drink up the whole thing. I'll give you water hold on. Here, you good? You know, I wanna go change this one, it looks so down. I have the, not really good but it's a Hey 'cause we just like pass that one. That's the one the 10 a.m. that I told you. - Where is it? The no, no, no two minutes. - Oh that's 10? Yeah that's 10 a.m. So we're good. - Okay. - And then the next cut off time is 8:00 p.m. - Relax. Where is the other one? That one. Can you get the, just the handle. Please, thank you. Can you transfer some of the water here? No, no, not that one. Okay, thank you. Yeah, I'm just checking my system. You want more? - No I'm good. What is it? Your vest? - No it's okay. My shoes melt. - Watch your shoes, watch your shoes. - Melts, see this? Melt. Did that melt or just wear? - It melts. - It melts. Tell me about it? - It's a new shoes. Five minutes ago I would say it wears easily cause it melts. - Yeah pavement. It's like, - it's hot. - It's hot. All right let's go. Yes let's do this. I'm just gonna. Carry on soldier. - I'm just gonna pee. You made it. - I'm going to go down To Panamint Spring. - No, I looked right away-- - You need another scarf? - Yeah, might as well. What we gonna do, you gonna take them at the downhill, - Yeah. - And then you take them though the last five-- Fly to Panamint Spring, and then Ibar is gonna do a pill after that. - It's still cold, but it's gonna be hot down. I'm okay. Are you okay running down? - Do I need something to kick in? Going downhill? - Maybe like, I'm gonna get a shot of that. CarboPro? - No, no the CarboPro, and then you can add more CarboPro. No that's not a real Finish that. - Finish this? - I'm just gonna go, get something. Real downhill or something there. - Yeah. I'm good. - Just need water. Are you ready? So the first parking spots, because you cannot park, where there isn't designated parking. How many miles is that? - It's like seven. - One point. Seven? It's on the free park. Oh free park. Okay, let's go. - Yeah, okay let's go. I'm just gonna wet this and the I'm gonna go. - This is quite the race. The highlights probably would be the extreme conditions that these runners run in. You think, I'm actually running my first a hundred miler in a couple of months. And I'm excited about that, but if nothing like the conditions of this race. This race starts in 110 degree temperature, and just goes up from there. Very, very difficult race, mentally very challenging. These athletes are some of the fittest in the world, but that's probably not enough. You've got to have the mental toughness to get through this 135 minutes. - It's a team effort, not as like an individual, you know, effort. It's always a team. If someone's, if you especially, you know, on the second night, so you just need to bite your lips. 'Cause everyone's goal is to bring that runner to the finish line strong, no injury and you know, everybody's just like, you know, need to have the patience I guess is the word. - It's very important. You know, when you are running with this kind of distances, you know, takes like 24 hours, that's the backbone for your, you know, and how you finish the race. Because when you are tired, you forget all these things. You know, nutrition, you got a plan, you have a spreadsheet, but go to mile or hour number 18, your done, like all right, let's just keep on running. But the crew will remind you of what the things you need to do. So I think running is like probably 30 or 40 %. Crew is like 60 or 70 %. So that's very important to running. - But it's still hot. It'll take you 10 minutes to do what we did in an hour. - Yeah. Right around your joints - Yeah the joints. - Then the muscles. - I'll weigh it in, Panamint Springs - Panamint Springs. Soonest. - That's the next one. - That's the next one, yeah. Steve you were saying that Badwater is difficult because it's on pavement? - Difficult 'cause it's on pavement compared to a lot of ultras, which are on the dirt and it really takes a beating on the joints, taking the knees, the hips, the back. It's much more difficult running hard surface compared to the dirt surface. On the body. - Is there like, something like nutrition, to keep me going. - We are taking a burger I see. - Like bucket with ice. - What are you saying, hurting? - Just like put them in ice, all right? We're gonna recycle this. This are, environmental friendly. Recycle the socks. Thank you Peachy, you can pit it down now. No, no, no. - No, no, I'm gonna go keep this one for later on. - Yeah. - Right, only one mile. - Gerald is going on, Gerald is Gerald doing five Badwaters it's not, no offense meant to people that does 5k. I do a lot of short races, but I don't think it's even on the physical side, I've seen that, I've read about it. Not just Badwater. I read about, you know, I read about ultra runners. For me it's 95 % mental. So he's very unique 'cause it's not the physical part, he's very mentally strong. So that's when if he thinks he's gonna finish, he's gonna finish. So the body just follows. We've seen that in some of the, you know videos of, ultra runners doing, you know, 100 day runs, you know, through the deserts of, you know, running through what eight countries I think. Even if they were hurt, they recover. But they never stopped running every day, you know? So it's basically mind over matter. You know, so once you think that you're gonna finish, and that's very rare, most of the time before you can even start, you're really doubting yourself and obviously to do five Badwater. There's no doubt in this guy. That's why he always finishes you know? Because he is very strong mentally. I think that's key to being an ultra runner. So you know that, your pain threshold is very high, you know? Because there's so much pain, but if your mind is stronger than the pain, then you don't feel that, you don't worry about it too. A lot of people do, you know, so that's why before they can even start there basically you might as well not start. 'Cause see if you're doubting yourself, then don't, all right? 'Cause that's 135 miles, you know? So I've done it by diving. And it was a struggle with this drive, first time I went there for not the crew, but the watch the team, I had my dog with me, me and my dog had to struggle just to kinda, keep up with the race, you know? So just imagine you're actually doing it for 135 miles. And again, average heat in Badwater it's like at least more 110. So that's very rare. So I'm very proud of Gerald here that, you know, it's like all very inspiring what he's doing. And I love that because, you know, that's always, what I want is to be involved with something that would inspire people. And that's what he has done, you know. So thank you, thank you for inspiring you know. So what did you say? - Have you seen those cars they are going back? With those crew. May be they are going back where-- They might be done. Yeah, they might be done. Yeah. 'Cause I know that number one, probably somebody-- It's okay. - It's like so, I'm ready to get that temperature reading. - Okay try, try-- 133. - It's hot. 133. - I think it's a good idea that we walk. - I think the electrolytes were-- - That one. - Oh my God, my feet are burning. - Wait, wat, wait. Remove your glasses. Gerald why do you run the Badwater 135. - What are you saying? Why do you run the Badwater 135. - I don't even know what the answer. He loves me. - I don't even know what the answer for now. 'Cause I'm crazy. Wait, wait, wait. At this temperature, I don't know why. - What a minute Gerald didn't you just ask me a while ago? - Yeah This is crazy. - Ibar, why did you join the 135 race? - It's heaven. - I think I know what heaven means. - I think we are a bunch idiots, that's why. - A little crazy. - We're not even half way yet. - Okay the half way, I think it's 72. - Okay 70 is 140, okay. Just over halfway. - Okay, it's nice to know. - All right, you gonna take this. All right let's go. - It's like, it's 200 degrees. - Do you have enough? - Again, I've been doing this for a long time. And my dream is to see that Philippine flag being waved at Badwater. And I know a lot of guys that were doing the race and some of them I sponsored too, but they were not Filipinos, right? So, my dream was to see a flag. The Philippines flag. One day I said there should be a Philippine flag in the Badwater race or at the Badwater race. And I only knew four ultra runners back in the days. It was just Ben, it was Carmela Laison. The guy from San Francisco, Rick Gaston and other girl Tess Gedes. Tess Gedes owns that Rim to Rim in the ultra race in Arizona Grant to grant. And she also owns that race in Hawaii, which is the volcano, to volcano I think, right? So we only had four Filipino ultra runners back in the day, when we were seven or eight years ago. So my challenge was, "Hey, if anyone wants to do it, "I'll take care of everything." I'll pay for the entry fee I'll provide the vehicle. Everything they need 'cause we're ahead hey, own a running store so everything they needed we can get right? We can get sponsorship. So that was a standing order. Everybody one by one, I remember Rick Gaston, "I only do ultra, I only do trail running." And Tess Gedes too so, I think it was boiling down to just you and supposed to be Carmella, right? But for some reason, Carmella, I think stopped, you know. So Ben was like the best fit and Ben was, "Oh man, I'm not gonna do it. "I don't lie to do that, "It's on the road as well, "I don't want to do the road." But eventually, you know, the calling was there, you know, and to be the first one was, you know, scary. But at the same time, if the community like us we're there to provide support, then it could become a reality, right? So I think that's something that we're really so proud of being part of. Not like going, "Oh Ben will make it happen." You know, like whatever you need, we'll hey, I wanna share that. 'Cause we were in a very rare, you know position because we're in the running industry, you know? And that's what I did too in the Philippines, we brought, not that there were no running there, but we tried to cultivate running in the Philippines too. Like a few years back when we opened our stores there you know so, very rare. That was a funny story back in the days now, I was, and there's four. I think I posted it on them and then I challenged the four of them who wants to get. It took him like two years. I think he said, you know what, I'm gonna do it. It took two years, you know, for somebody to really, you know what let's do it. And the rest is history, right, so. - I run like the first six miles. It was so hot. After six miles, I stopped running, even though it's a descent, but they stopped running. I walk, I decided, and then that was so smart for me. My pacer was Steve, and then he told me that, that is so smart. You walk because it's too hot. So it's a strategy. So I don't wanna be overheated. And you know that there's, after the descent in Panamint Spring, it's like you crossed that sand dunes. That was so hot, that was the hottest place that I've ever felt in that race. It feels like 135 for me. I was even touching my shoes and then my shoes got melt in that like mile I wanna say like mile 68 it started to melt. The rubber started ripping out. And I was like, I mean it's like a month old shoes. It was crazy. So how far are we in the course? - This will be mile 80, when we get here. Mile 80. - Mile 80, yes so we are making progress. So we're almost to the 100 mile mark? Almost to the 100 mile mark yeah. The next check off will be at 91, mile 91. How's our runner going? I think he's doing very well. He's tenacious, he just does not give up. That was really hot a couple of hours ago as we saw and experienced. And for him to make it through that, that's pretty impressive, he just kept going. He's picking up speed? - And he's picking up speed. I think he's gaining confidence. I can see that in him. He's kind of bypassing the van if you noticed. And I think he's gonna finish strong. How many people have a DNF already? - Well, when I looked at the last check-in station, there were somewhere between 12 and 15 that DNFed. Wow. - Including some. Is this yours? - It's not, no, no sorry. Including - I just don't need to be conned. Yeah. Including some very elite runners. Yeah, well. - So yeah. We're going strong. - Going strong, hopefully keep it going. - When I was in the Philippines, I was like dreaming of running some day in the US like I was reading like, I used to buy those magazines, "The Runner's World" magazines in the Philippines. Like I go to like a PX Goods store and then buy this old 'Runner's World" magazines. And then I like, "Oh, this is so cool, "I'm gonna go there, I'm gonna run the New York marathon." I was like reading this Oprah wearing, I mean, running the New York marathon. So someday I'm gonna go there, I'm gonna run. Now, you have to be a runner. You have to run fast to be a competitive runner. So I don't have time to train. I work like a dog. I work 10 hours a day. So I didn't have time for training. It's hard to juggle up like, juggle family, training and running. I mean training, running and your family. Finally,. - Tough. - Yeah. - All right good. - Everything is Christine. - That's really hot, you survived 135. It's very, no, no, no, no. I'm talking about the hat. - I know. - It's kinda like relevant to the race. - 135 degrees. - 135 degrees. - Oh, the temperature, that was so hot. Badwater 135, 135 degrees. - See it now. - I know, I haven't looked at my shoes yet. - Yeah you've not. - Yeah. Not much, not as yours. I can only run I know 126. And I'm dead. - That was hard, to survive. - My, allusions like kick in. - Do we still have ice? - Yes. - We're gonna buy in a Lone Pine, right? You think, you still have those bags? - Yeah, I still have like three under, or four untouched yeah. - Untouched? - It's not melt? - No, 'Cause I bought, there's like two in there and then I bought another five. So I guess we're good. - What time is it? - 7:01. - Steve. - No, he's already ready for it. - 7:10, 7:10. - Oh, okay. - We gonna leave at 7:10. What's 7:10. - Rest - like it's 7:01. 7:01? - Like nine, yeah. It's 10 minutes. - Oh it's 7:10, got it. - Do you want me to put you bandana? Got it. What is it? - A bandana. Oh, I don't need. - You don't a bandana? Okay. - No. - What is of importance, well, for me, I've always been in the running industry. So especially as a Filipino, that was kind of rare in the past. So about 20 years, slowly I've met Ben. Some guys as well. There was only a few before, And now there's like, You have done what four now? - Five. - Five, so that's amazing. So when we ID and they own that there, when we were doing the blogs, our blogs with BR and AR and you know, that'd be, I mean eventually we can produce someone from the Philippines to come and do our Filipino, to do a Badwater and now, So I think it's very important cause it's inspiring. We're all promoting health and fitness plus, the idea of there's no limit, you know, right? Now you can do 135 miles in 127 degree heat and it's doable and it's not just doable by people we don't know, but people we know. So it makes the dream a reality that there, special athletes run. They are very special but knowing that they're also Filipinos, it makes it very realistic. So do this, we're actually empowering everyone. Hey, just follow your dream, you know? So eventually it's gonna happen with us. There's a little edge, that we take like see we're in this environment of running, most accepted, most accessible But are now we're seeing actual Filipinos training in the Philippines doing Badwater. So that's for me the value of inspiration by this guys, you know, they inspired them to, if they can do it, those guys can do it as well. I think I'm just happy now I'm part of that because I'm in that industry, you know? So I think that's what I can add on, Very important 'cause we're inspired people. And that's you know, ultimate as a whole is to inspire others, you know? Especially reaching out - What? - They gonna be waiting for us. - Yeah. I think two miles. - That's a classic location right in there. Yeah. - It's red, it's not full blister but it's red there. - What is this? - It's okay? - My legs. - You're a king man. I don't wanna be a princess. - At what mile? 90. - Mile 90? Yeah. - No princess at mile 90? That's like the new shoes right? - No. This is just like two mile. Peachy are you getting ready to run? Oh yeah, but the runner is not. I'm but he's not. Let him rest though. So from here what's our next stop. - Six mile, well we're gonna do six mile exchanges. So Peachy is gonna run six miles. Run not. Well, it's up to Gerald. It's downhill so he might run a bit. And then Ibar's gonna run six and then I'll do six. And then we're gonna go four, four, four, and then we're hopefully gonna be as Lone Pine at that point. And that'll be about daybreak, probably around six o'clock, 6:00 p.m. or a.m. excuse me. And then it would probably take us about four or five hours going up the 13 miles. So that should be good time. So my guess is in 11 or 12 o'clock, then we shall see. And that would be like, mid-sub 40s. Yeah that'd be sub 40, yeah which would be great. Is Gerald picking up good speed, good time? He's consistent right now. I don't know if we're picking up time, but he's been consistent. He just keeps going. He may be can pick up a little bit of time on this downhill. It's down downhill yeah. Especially if he were to run but. It's a catch 22, If you run, you get more tired and then you need to rest more. Otherwise blisters. It's catch 22. They'll be okay. They're gonna be a little painful but at this point he just guts it out. No major injuries? - No, he's just very fit. Put together well. Where are we at now Steve? - We are six miles from the intersection of the 395. And how far is that in to our race? - In the race 13, 19 miles left. Wow, we crossed the 100 mile? - Yeah, crossed a 100 while you were snoozing. How's Gerald? - We didn't videotape you snoozing, snoring though, but we could have. I don't get into the desert. How's Gerald doing? - He's doing well, he's tired. He's taken naps kind of. He's marching forward? - Every two hours, he's marching forward, yeah. All right. - He's got a big climb coming up though. That'll be interesting. 13 Miles left? - 19 miles left. 19 miles left and do only. - About six miles flat downhill and then 13 miles up. And it's only barely six o'clock. - Six o'clock, yep. Yeah. - So he's got a chance to finish under 40 hours. - To beat his time. - Well, we'll see. My guess is still around 11 or 12 he's gonna finish so. All right. - We'll see how it goes. The runner's high. The runner's high is due to endorphins that are produced with exercise. And usually it's fairly extreme exercise. You need to produce those endorphins. And it's the same effect that you get if you eat chocolate, you fall in love, You take narcotics, all the same stuff. It's a neurotransmitter that's in the brain and it increases during strenuous exercise, during such things as ultras. It's probably going off the charts as far as, the production of the endorphins. - Oh, it's a weather. This is the first time I felt that the sunglasses melt on my face. And that I really need to focus on Gerald, to make sure that, you know, hydration wise that he's, hydrated enough to go to the 135, specialty that's long stretch. And we kinda changed the strategy this year, compared from last year so, and being a chief crew is hard, 'cause you have to think not just for the runner, but for the whole team. - The elements out there, temperature wise it's just record-breaking. Now you can get run 135 degrees Fahrenheit temperature but you know, Gerald's determination, yeah, he's making it look really easy. And that's the mental toughness that I've seen in Gerald so. - Oh Badwater you're not disappointed with what is being tagged as the word toughest footrace. So I have proven that, that's true since I've ran for about 50 kilometers from Stovepipe Wells up to Panamint Springs. So it's really true. You have the elevation, the heat, the distance and the wind. - What can I say? It's the hottest place on earth? My God, it's very challenging. Yeah, but it's beautifully dangerous. I like the solitude, but it's the route. It's majestic, but it's very dangerous. But I love Badwater. I fell in love with it when I joined it in 2016. So I told myself I'm gonna come back for you know, for another try. - It's like you're in an oven. You open the open and it just blows into your face. Like continuously. I completed the race in 44 hours. But a lot of it was tough, like I, you can eat a lot, you have to manage the, like you have really heat train. Like when I was at mile 42, I think I over ate knowing that, okay, I have'nt since the start up the race 5:00 p.m., I hadn't had breakfast or lunch. So that was my big meal, right? And I was the tackle 17 miles of climbing so, I over ate, and during the climb was hot. My body couldn't process it. I was surprised like after one mile or two miles how come there's nothing, I was about to throw up. And after I cleared it up, then I had been resurgent again. - Badwater 135 isn't ultra marathon, it's a 135 miles. It starts from Badwater Basin, which is 282 feet below sea level. And then it crosses Death Valley. And then it ends in Mount Whitney Portal, which is 8,360 feet. Mount Whitney Portal is a trailhead of Mount Whitney, which is the highest mountain in the contiguous United States. The race is always held in July, which is the temperature is basically 120 to 130 degrees. Is it? - I'll be right in there. - Yeah maybe take it off right? - Is it? - Yeah, it's. - It's not bad, right? - It's not super bad, but it's red. - And then this too. - You gonna throw this. This is disposable socks Ibar. - Like this one? - The one, no no, There's a white one that. Was that the one? - It's gonna be the same spot probably. - Same spot, right? It's getting worse. - Yeah, it's red, it's not really a blister yet. - Oh so. - I'll just draw the outline of it-- - Yeah, yeah. - It's like an area just about like that. It's probably gonna get a blister. - Yeah, we'll just have to fix it. Yeah, towel thanks. All right. I told you it's plain bun. - Bun and a burger. - Burn and a burger, yeah. - Is this a prank? Got some more in there? - What is this? Eat some of that yeah. - It is fine. Is this yours? - No that is Ibar's it's okay. Oh it's a prank. 122. - 122 122 wow! - We have to go up that hill. - So feeling-- Finish it finish it. So sad Tess. - So she decided to call it quits. I think so yeah. The record, is 29, that's the new record. - I don't know. - Yeah, it's something like 20, 20, 21 yeah. - 29 is the highest. - Wow super. - It was 135, the weather yesterday. That's what I told to my kids you know, we're walking for almost two miles at the Badwater Basin, and your dad's runnning 135 miles. You have to imagine that. That's what he said, and then, Rita Rona said, you know-- - you know, because you can tell all your vacation, like, no, I'm not proud of it. I'm not telling anybody. Donna Interesting stories about Gerald. - Gerald is an old school guy, he's an old school guy. He's not really a techy one. Actually he just changed his cell phone from the flip what's that? It's flipped just. Smartphone phone? - Yeah, just three years ago, something like that. Because his boss will get angry. He cannot easily accept the picture or something. And then Gerald was my boyfriend since I was 14 years old. And whenever he would go to our house, he will sit down on the same place. That's what I remember. On that corner. And I did not notice about that. Who noticed was our housekeeper. Oh, you know, Gerald is a nice guy. He's not you know, I mean he has one place to stay in our house, something like that. So I think that's it. He's a good father. - Yeah, because my mom and dad, I was still young. My mom and dad don't want us to go out. So if he wants to see me, he will visit in our house. And I wasn't able to ride in his car. So he would just go to our house. That was when I was 14 years old. He's my first boyfriend. So I love my husband very much. He's coming now. - It's not party time yet. Oh okay. - We still have 11 miles to go. - Give me a dance, give me a dance. Almost there. Go Gerald. Great job man! Yeah we got it, you need rest room or anything? No, I'm good. - Okay good job. You guys are wild-- Go bro, let's go. Well, what did he ask? - He's asking, where's the kid. He's always like that. He's always, you know, whenever we go away, he's always, "Oh, where's the kids? "How's the kids now? "Can you call them?" He's like, that was really a good father. You're wearing your jacket out really. - No I'm good. - You're good? - Yeah I'm good. - You're doing good daddy. Kids enjoyed. - Is there a bathroom, I'm gonna clean my teeth. - Oh you want? Where's the bathroom. I don't know, where do yo go usually? All right, have fun guys, be safe. Bye bye. - Right now he's more stronger though. Even though the time is really late, but he's still more stronger. - Yeah, that's why we know that he can survive there. - He's gonna be faster there than usual, yeah. - We know that he can survive there because, he's still straight. And then even though 29 runners DNF now so, even slow just okay, as long as he can finish. - That's why I told him, he's tougher than Badwater. - What? Badwater. - He's tougher than Badwater. Yeah. - He was like, this is tough, but you're tougher. Do you miss him? Yeah. - I think he's around the corner. Phil, yeah yeah. Phil is our friend, a good friend of ours. He's a race director of the Great New York hundred miles race. Yeah, he's the race director. He's a good friend of ours. He and Gerald jam each other. He plays piano and Gerald sing or whatever plays drums. They go together. He's a nice guy. - Gerald, sorry I missed you Lone Pine. I ran after you and I just missed you, but you got to another one man, congratulations crush it! All right Phil. - All right all right. I'll see you there. - Take care. - I'll see you at the awards or whatever. Phil all ready? - Yeah where I saw these guys at McDonald's. - Because I want you to go with us also. But you go finish. When are you going home? - Tomorrow. - Tomorrow? Oh yeah, where are you going tomorrow? - I'm not going home though. I'm going to New York and then getting on a bus to Virginia Beach for a party, my cousin he's throwing for me, it's along story. - Oh Phil, James this is Phil McCarthy the race director of the Greater New York 100 mile running expedition. Yes, he's a good friend of Gerald. - What kind of songs do you guys sing? - 70s, 80s songs. Yeah. - Yeah. He's a musician. - Yeah we like to jam at their house. Nice. And he's about to break the world record. - Yes, we're running across the country from San Francisco to New York. That's coming up. - Yeah, good luck. You can do it Phil. Yeah, Phil is a good friend of ours, yeah. All right. - I think I can feel just beaten down. How many miles more to go? - We've got about six, six and a half, something like that to go. We're gonna do two more miles. And then our anchor's gonna take over. Ibar is gonna do the last four miles, steep four miles. What's the elevation from here to the destination? - We're about 5,200, we're going to about 83? - 83 right? - Something like that 82, 83. So we've got about 3000 more. 3000. - And then so, it's gonna be about 500 each mile, particularly the last four miles. That's gonna be really steep. So Ibar's gonna work out for him the last four miles. He might give up? No. No. Last 10K come on! DNF. - No. Last 10K. I know, what do you call it? One foot in front of the other. It's a climb. - No, no. No, 3.6. You got a 5K from that corner up there, you got a 5K to get up there. - Okay. - The Badwater 5K. - I'm just gonna check my, check all my systemic if it's working, and I'm good to go. - Okay. - I'll see you at the. See you at the party. - Oh you not gonna go and. - No, I got people to watch. - Gotcha. - Okay. - Yeah, I'll see you tonight. - Yes, thank you. - How many people have a DNF so far? We have 29. 29? - 29 is the count for DNF. Is that a record breaking number? - Of that that I don't know, but it is a very high number. It's almost one third of the total count of racers, yeah. - I have pin this one, I will be the 30th. - You will. Yeah right? - Right, no you gonna finish. You gonna finish. I've already put you down here you're gonna finish so. - No turning back. - Okay, thank you. - I said, I'm not gonna give him the 30. - You know, you do not want to be the 30 - Yeah. - No. - Thank you. Welcome I will see you at the finish tonight. - All right thank you so much, see you later. Finish line. Ibar finish line. - Yep. It's not gonna be easy. Going back to the hotel. - Section by section, one mile at a time. Yeah that's the best strategy for running long distance. You don't have to think about 135 miles ahead. You just think about one station at a time, like 17 miles, 42 miles. And then that 17 miles, you have to cut into another section until one foot in front of the other.
