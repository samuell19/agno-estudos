MARCUM: Sunday, July fourth, 11:05 a.m. In a few moments, some of these people will become holiday weekend safety statistics, participants in a major smash-up on California's Interstate 5. Thirty-nine vehicles will be involved. Sixty-two people will be injured. Fourteen will die. Officially, it will be listed as 11-79, accident caused by mechanical failure. Nothing will appear in the record about fear, anger, love, frustration, about the human factor. This story is about that human factor, about some of those holiday statistics. Who they were, what they did in the 40-odd hours that brought them all, complete strangers, together to face their destiny on Interstate 5. I'm Sam Marcum, Sergeant, California Highway Patrol. I'm one of those statistics. RADIO HOST: All right, then, all you beautiful dolls, be the next to light up the board and add fuel to the Fourth of July fireworks and sample the sexy savvy of your big daddy. Open your hot, little hearts and tell all, and I do mean, open your hot, little hearts. [BLOWING HORN] I gotta talk to you! What? I love you! I love you, too. Take the next off-ramp. What? The next off-ramp! [INAUDIBLE] Hey, honey. Let's get off some place. Hey, cool it. You want to get us killed? [INDISTINCT POLICE RADIO CHATTER] Knock it off. What? What's the matter? There's a cop back there. We gotta get off the freeway. Oh! Hang on, Juno. We'll be home soon. Oh, don't worry. It's just a little one. I'll be all right. [HORNS HONKING] Get down! Look out!Hold on! Well, men, on this bright, sunny, Friday afternoon the second of July, you know what we have ahead of us, don't you? We have the glorious Fourth, glorious to everyone but us. Oh, incidentally, there's some rain down south coming our way and that creates problems that we're all familiar with. SORRENSON: Little water on the road.[MEN CHUCKLE] Yes, Sorrenson, a little water. There's gonna be a lot of senior citizens driving too slowly, teenagers driving too quickly. There'll be old cars, bald tires, vapor locks, and hot tempers. There will be drunk drivers, sick babies, and smash-ups. So, now, we all remember Marcum's Law, of course. ALL: Anything that can go wrong will go wrong! I'm proud of you, men. And the speed limit is still... ALL: Fifty-five miles per hour! Now, let's get out there and serve with pride. You too, Sorrenson. There he is now. Jimmy! Hello, lady. How you doing? How you feeling? Anything happening? No, not yet. Um, you forgot your lunch. Oh, thank you. Laureen drove me over with it. MARCUM: Officer Hutton! I and this entire unit would like to know what you've done to this poor child. [CHUCKLING] Seriously, I saw you last night in the supermarket, and I have never seen anyone hustle out of a check-stand so quickly. So, will you try a little harder? You are making nervous wrecks out of grown men. I'll do my very best. Thank you.Sam. Can I talk to you a minute? Uh, may I see your driver's license, please? Oh, shut up. Listen. I want to talk to you about this typical male attitude of yours. She's having a baby and you're nervous? The way you've been carrying on about your kid sister, you'd think you were having the baby. She could get married first. Mmm-hmm, you know I've been trying. Listen, I gotta get Barbara home and then get to the hospital. I'm almost late now. Well, if I finish work early, I'll stop by. [MARCUM SIGHS] She's really getting uptight, Sam. You know, I think she's going to try to get me to quit the Patrol. You just got in.Yeah, I did, but she thinks you talked me into it. Would I do a thing like that? To a nice guy like you? [FUNKY MUSIC PLAYING] ERICA: Trudy? Oh! [CHUCKLING] Dynamite! I was about to give up. I thought you weren't going to show. I still don't quite see this as your scene. Well, I've had my share of TV and sympathy. It was the same way with me after my divorce. Welcome to the rat race. Booze first, laughs later. Relax. Just relax and let it all happen. [LAUGHING] Hey, Trudy.Oh, Danny! Oh, Danny, meet Erica. We work together at the lab. Hi, Erica. You look terrific. Well, I do my best. Dance? Uh, why not? [GUN FIRES] EARL: Stop him! Stop him! [GUN FIRES][PENNY SCREAMS] Get out of the way! Get out of the way! Somebody call the cops. I shot a guy. I didn't mean to. It just happened. How bad are you hurt? It's funny. It doesn't hurt at all. Maybe it's not bad.Let's see. Let me see!No, it's okay. Now, come on. We got to ditch this car. Somebody might've gotten the license. You got to get with it, Erica. I mean, it's a whole new ball game. There are no sides, no rules. You just got to keep it loose and easy. Nothing too personal. Right. Right on. You do your thing. I do mine. And nobody owes anybody anything. That's it! And it has nothing to do with love, right? Right. But it's love that I'm talking about. The way it is right now, you know, you gotta keep it free, loose and easy. Hey kid, meet Jason. Hi. Jason, meet Erica. DANNY: Hey, she's got great flesh. Some people have, some haven't. You've got great flesh. You better believe him. He knows. He really knows 'cause he's a doctor. [GIGGLES] Chiropractor. Well, nobody's perfect. [ALL LAUGHING] TRUDY: I love it! Oh, I told you about her! What say to getting out of here and going someplace nice and private? Uh, give me just a minute to go to the john, huh? You got it. Oh, bud! Will you look at the lovebirds! I'll be right back.Okay. Isn't she great? Oh, she has a great sense of humor. And she really digs Danny's action. I imagine. Thanks. Thank you. Thank you very much. DANNY: Hey! Hey! Hey, leave it to old Danny to come up with a solution, huh? Hey, I thought we had a thing going. Look, it's raining. It's a madhouse in there. Why don't we both split, go somewhere else? I don't know about you, Danny Boy, but I'm going home. Look, uh, Trudy said you were out of it. You wanted some laughs, but it's cool. I'm not starving, you know what I mean? I'm happy for you. I got a great idea. Why don't we go down to my boat? Just the two of us. Not tonight. I'm really beat. Some other time, huh? [CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO] What are you doing? I'm washing the breakfast dishes for some reason. Well, come on, let's get going. Go do something. I'll be ready in a minute. I've done everything. That's nice. Go do something else. I thought of something.Good. It's some advice that Prime Minister Disraeli gave to a young man who was running for Parliament. "My boy," he said, "The most important thing I can tell you "about running for public office "is never miss an opportunity to go to the bathroom." [CHUCKLING] Juno?Yes? I talked to Allen and Alisa. They're going to keep an eye on the house while we're gone. Good. Did you remember to pack all our reading material? Hey.Oh. I was just looking at my years. Vanity, vanity, thy name is woman. Ready to go? Albert, why won't you tell me where we're going? I can't. It's a big surprise. There have been a lot of surprises lately. You must be guilty of something. Whoop, you found out. I'm keeping another woman. Mmm-hmm. Some young thing in your history class, with big eyes. It's not just her eyes. Come on. We're going to have a lot of fun. Okay, I'll meet you at the car. Now what? Well, if you must know, I'm going to follow Prime Minister Disraeli's advice. If you must know. FEMALE RADIO DJ: Well, then, kiddies, it's 10:09 a.m. on a leaky third of July and it looks like the showers are going to hang in here in San Diego for a beat, but have no fear.

Okay, Randy. 55 miles an hour. Wow, thanks. I mean, for not writing us up. Well, I figure it like this. If I write you up, you'd probably just pay the fine. This way, you may just think about it. You got it. No, you almost got it. Come on, hurry up. MALE RADIO HOST: And on this second day of the holiday weekend, so far, traffic accidents are lower than expected. There, that's about the best I can do. Okay. You all right, you think? [COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO] Pete?[GROANS] Uh, yeah, terrific. Hey, he ought to be in a hospital. Forget it. That's what I think. That's all. Hey, listen, what's your name, anyway? Lee, my name's Lee Bassett. Oh, yeah? Well, uh, you just drive, Lee Bassett. Okay? Yeah, sure, but, uh, where? Just drive! [WHIMPERS] Get on the freeway and head north. Hey, aren't we going to Big Sur? We'd be all right there, wouldn't we? Now cool it, would you? I'm trying to think. You know, he shouldn't lose much more blood. Maybe you ought to see a doctor. Hey, shut up, both of you. And turn off that radio. PENNY: What'll that hurt? Oh... Now, somebody around here better start listening to me, or somebody else is gonna get wasted. Okay? Okay, okay. [BREATHING HEAVILY] [PHONE RINGING] Fantastic.

I figured you might have changed your mind. About what? The boat! The boat. It's a great day for fun and games at sea. No people, no clothes. Just us and the big, blue ocean.

Thought I might drive down to San Diego and see you if you're not busy. Oh, I'm seeing Jeff but we're not doing anything special. Like tomorrow we're celebrating the Fourth of July by watching the dolphins jump through red, white and blue hoops. Jeff's a SeaWorld freak! Hey, you can come with us. He won't mind. Oh, well, I don't want to interrupt your plans. Oh, Mom, stop. I really want to see you. When can you come? Well, I could leave right away. Drive carefully.

We did it. We did it. I'm so proud of you. Good girl. You know you made me an aunt? I know. Oh, I want Jimmy to be here, too. Where do you suppose he is? Don't worry, he'll be here. Poor Jimmy. All those practice sessions and now he's missed the main event. Hey, you get a little sleep now, all right? Okay.All right. He looks just like Jimmy. I know. Six pounds... Excuse me, six-pound, eight-ounce boy. Looks just like the father. Boy, it doesn't take you long to find out things, does it? No, no it doesn't. How's Barbara? She's fine.Well, that's good. Where the heck is Jimmy?I don't know. He should be charging in any minute. Hey, I'm on duty, you know. You're on duty?Yeah. Come on, let's go in there.Okay. Hi. Hi. [BOTH CHUCKLE] Oh, Sam. [SIGHS] Why does everything have to be so complicated with us? Because you make it that way. You're the one that complicates it. Look at Jimmy. Look at Barbara. They met, they fell in love, they got married, and now they have a son. You know I envy him, don't you? Of course I do. You know that. Well? I wish I could look at life the way Barbara does, but I can't. You know what it is? [CLEARING THROAT] It's working here in this hospital. All the pain, all the suffering. Quit. Just walk out. Let's start a family. Thank you. It has nothing to do with my job. You know the deal. I'll marry you any time you say. But if we're going to have a family, and I want one, Sam. You do, too, I know. Then you're going to have to take that promotion and get off the road. Sam, I want my kids to be able to kiss their daddy good bye in the morning and know they're gonna see him again that night. I can't make it behind a desk. I've tried. You know I tried. I just can't make it behind a desk, that's all. You're just being pig-headed. You're the one that's being pig-headed.[SIGHS] You're trying to change my life. I'm not trying to change your life. Sam, I'm trying to keep it. Can't you understand that? WOMAN: [ON PA] Sergeant Marcum, Sergeant Marcum. There's an emergency call for you, Sergeant Marcum. We'll talk about it later. [INDISTINCT POLICE RADIO CHATTER] I'm sorry, Sam. How did it happen? You got anything? Not much. We have a witness. Gave us a description of the car. Gray Olds. Not much more. How did it happen? What did you see? Did you see anybody else in the vehicle? Anybody in the car? Easy, Sam. He doesn't speak much English. [SPEAKING SPANISH] I'm sure he told me all he knows. I'll go over it with him again in a minute.

[EXCLAIMS] How do you like it?Whose is it? Ours. Oh, you big, dumb, beautiful jackass. I knew you'd like it. Oh, it's wonderful, Albert. It's just beautiful. But how can we afford it? We can only be here weekends. Well, Juno, I am taking a sabbatical. I'm taking the whole year off. We can be here as much as we want to be. I think I'm gonna cry. Well, before you start, how would you like to check out the view from the bed? I beg your pardon? Just a suggestion.[LAUGHING] How far am I supposed to go? We got to fix that tire. Pete. Pete.[GROANING] We've gotta do something. Yeah, I know. Hey! [SCREAMING] What are you doing? LEE: Just sit there and shut up! Look what you did to him. What I did to him? He shot a cop, for God's sakes! A cop! I was with him! That makes me an accessory. If you help him, I'll tell them the truth. Ha, you think they're going to believe you? I'm on parole right now. Not for any killing, but I ripped off a car. God knows what you been into. Hey, where you going? We got to get him to a doctor. I can pay you. I've got money. I just met him. He was going to get some money so we could go to Big Sur. I didn't know he had a gun. I didn't know that guy would get shot in the liquor store. I didn't know. Please don't leave me. Wow. This is a lot of bread. Should help. What are you gonna do? Stay there and shut up. [SULTRY MUSIC PLAYING] DEBBIE: I think somebody's there!Huh? I heard the door open. Hi. [ENGINE RATTLING] Oh, no!

[EXCLAIMS] [BIKERS LAUGH AND CHEER] BURNSEY: Get her, fellas! [ALL CLAMORING] [INDISTINCT] [HORNS HONKING] Hey, miss, you all right? What's it to you, fella? Get out of here, you little stooge. You going to let him push me around like that? Hey, man, what do you think you're doing, huh? Look what he's done to Andy! All right, let's get him.Yeah, come on. [SIRENS APPROACHING] Hey, are you all right? More or less. DORIS: 86-S1, Capistrano. 86-S1. Car matching description of vehicle involved in Officer Hutton's homicide, reported presently approaching junction I-5 and 101, headed north. 86-S1, ten-four. Hey, it's okay, everything's going to be all right. Did you, uh, bring any other clothes with you? In my car. Okay, we'll go look for a place for you to stay and then I'll come on back and pick up the car later. My name is Dale. Erica. Listen, Erica, let me ask you something. Come here often? [LAUGHING] No. Well, it wasn't that funny, but, uh, I'll warm up a little later. It just takes me a while, you know. [VAN DOORS SLAM] Yeah, it's not bad at all. We're just going to leave Pete here like that? Well, I am. I don't know about you. Yeah, but what am I supposed to do? I don't care. Hitch another ride. Go home. I can't! They threw me out. Please, I don't even know where I am. You can't just leave me here alone with him. [CAR ENGINE STARTS] Take me with you. I don't care where. I'm just no good alone. How'd you get to be such a mess, anyway? All right, get in. Come on. Remember when we used to swim, way far out? Yeah, I'm hungry. I didn't bring anything. I did. Now, you come here and sit right down there and don't let anybody steal our ocean. What are you up to now? You'll find out. I'll be right back. And save me a place. [GROANS] [CLASSICAL PIANO MUSIC PLAYING] Albert, that's our Chopin, the Nocturne in B Major. I, uh, hoped you'd remember. I'll always remember. You played it the first time we made love. We played it five times.[GIGGLES] [IN FRENCH ACCENT] Pepe le Moko thinks of everything. Now, what's that? Voila! Would you like to deal those? And with the nocturne. And it was a very good year for nocturne. Champagne, I remember. And... And caviar! And that was only the beginning. You all right? Oh, yes, really, I'm just happy. I'm really just so damn happy. So am I. FEMALE DISPATCHER: Capistrano, 86-S1. 86-S1, go ahead. Officer Berman, has definite ID. Oldsmobile used in Hutton homicide. 86-S1, ten-four. [INDISTINCT POLICE RADIO CHATTER] He's dead, Sam. My guess would be about an hour. The coroner and the local homicide guys are on the way. Anything on the vehicle yet? Yeah, it's stolen. San Diego. Best I could tell without moving the body there's no ID. Not very much to go on, is there? [INDISTINCT POLICE RADIO CHATTER] Hey, turn that thing down, will you? There's somebody in there. You got the keys? No keys, we couldn't find any. Get a tire iron. [KNOCKING ON TRUNK] Hang on, we'll get you out. SAM: Oh, my God. Help me get them out of here. Get an ambulance. Hang up while I get my car. More, please, sir.Sure! If I'd known you like champagne this much we'd have had it every day. Oh, I wouldn't want it every day. You see, champagne is very special and if I had it every day, then it wouldn't be special anymore. And if you keep on losing special things, then finally, nothing's left that's special. I think that's your fourth glass. Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers. If Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers, how many picks of peckled peepers, [LAUGHING] how many pecks, how many... I'll drink to that. You know where we're going tonight? Uh... The south of France. Nope. You and I are gonna get all dressed up and we're going to that big, new hotel and we are going to dance to music that we can recognize. Benny Goodman? Mmm. Not quite. But would you settle for, uh... Lou Rudolfo and his South Pasadena Blue Blowers? Well, since we are gonna go dancing, we ought to take a little nap. Now, I'll clean up. It's my party. You stay here and rest. [SINGING SOFTLY] [SINGING AND WHISTLING] Juno? Hey! Juno! Juno! Juno! Juno! Juno! Mr. Pearson, you're still here. Your wife's going to be all right now. We've given her something. She'll sleep right through the night. Wouldn't it be better if you came back tomorrow morning? No, I think I'll stay with her. All right. ERICA: I don't believe you. DALE: Do you have something against truck drivers? No, it's just, I don't believe that you quit medical school to become one. Well, when I was about eight years old, my dad got me one of those little medical doctor kits, know, with the plastic stethoscope and the peppermint pills. You know the kind. I tell you, I was the best kid on my whole block at playing doctor and that's the truth. And I tell you, I also, uh, I never thought of being anything but a doctor, for, I suppose, about 18 years. Until one day, I was in a lab in Syracuse, New York, and was dissecting a heart, laying open the pulmonary valve, the heart, the engine of life. And I thought, "What the hell else do I know about life?" Me, too. You, too, what? [STAMMERING] Um, well... Thinking about... Asking questions about life, at the end of a long marriage going nowhere. Only, I must say, I never thought of becoming a truck driver. Well, maybe you should. Pay's very good. Besides, and you're out on the open road. You do a lot of thinking, a lot of imagining. About what? Oh, about all the great things there are to do in this world besides dissecting hearts and filling teeth. Like what? Like... You really want to know? Sure. Okay. Like sleeping in the Great Pyramid at Cheops, in Egypt. Yeah, well, that's something to think about. No, but I really went. I really did it. You went to Egypt?Yes. And you slept in a pyramid? That's right. And what happened? Ah, dreams, dreams you wouldn't believe. I believe. Thank you. And today, I rescued a beautiful damsel in distress who will now dance with me, I hope. Then, next month, I'm headed for Australia. You're kidding. What, you don't believe me? Then why don't you come along? Well, you're, uh, still young. You can afford to be romantic. Sure, so can you. Oh, you don't believe that either? You're very beautiful, you know. Otherwise why would I bother to stop and pick you up? You cannot go through life from one adventure to another. Why not? What's better? A long marriage that's going nowhere? Well, now that's not fair. My husband was not a bad man. It's just we grew apart. My fault, too. Oh, Erica. You're free, you're single. Uh, with a daughter almost your age. Hey, lady, I am not interested in your daughter. [BOTH CHUCKLING] Dale, my husband... left me for a girl of 22, so when you say...There you go again with the numbers game. Twenty-two. Forty-one. Sixty-eight. Hike! So what? So when you were that, uh, little 8-year-old boy with a doctor bag, I was probably eight months pregnant. Well, if that's the case, I have to agree with you. We would have made a very unusual couple. Oh, Erica. It's not what they think. It's what we feel. Let me tell you what I feel right now. Um, I'm not sure I want to hear it. Well, I'm going to tell you anyway. Right now, I just want to take you someplace and I really want...Mmm-mmm. [GUITAR PLAYING] Hello. What were you doing? Oh, I'll tell you later. Like the man said, you're in good hands. I wish we could have gotten orange. It's the only kind I like. It's all I could get. Want some pizza? You sure we're safe here? Oh, yeah. For the night, anyway. We'll split early in the morning. Can we go to Big Sur? MAN: Hey, let's have another beer![WOMAN LAUGHS] Feel my heart. It's fantastic. It's right on the ocean, with big hills, and cliffs and rocks that go right into the sea. What are you talking about? Big Sur, dummy, you know. You must really like that place. What's so special about it? It's got seals and birds and sometimes the whales come right along the coast on their way to Baja. It's really nature. Hey, could we camp out there? Oh, yeah, it's a fantastic place for camping and we could hide out there and nobody would bother us. You know, you're like a little kid sometimes. It's hard to believe you hitchhiked all the way across the country, stayed in those communes. Can we go there in the morning? Everybody says it's fabulous. You mean you've never even been there? Well, not actually. But, I feel like I have. I mean, I've heard about Big Sur for years and once I saw a book with a lot of pictures of it. I just know that when I get there, everything is going to be all right for me. We've just gotta go. You know, you're really something Penny. You're a little nuts, but you're really something. You asleep? Mmm. I was just thinking about tomorrow, our Fourth of July. We're going to have so much fun. We're gonna laugh and eat tortillas... You like tortillas? Mmm!Okay, eighty-six the tortillas. We're definitely going to drink beer in Capistrano though and watch the swallows nest in the mission and shoot off firecrackers, I love firecrackers, since I'm a kid. Or, plan B, we can stay here in bed and make love all day. Mmm. Then, day after tomorrow, I could pick up a load in San Diego and we can drive to Texas. Texas? Yeah. We can make love in the Grand Canyon along the way. You are a beautiful man, Dale, and you live in a beautiful world of dreams and you've included me. And I love it.Oh, but they're not dreams, Erica. You come with me and I'll prove it. They're not dreams. I don't want to think about tomorrow. Let's just hold on to tonight. This is crazy.Hmm? I must be crazy. You don't meet a man and go to bed with him the same night. I don't. I'm crazy. Well, you look pretty good to me for a crazy lady, let me tell you. Oh, good lord, what time is it? It's 12:15, why? Oh, I forgot to call Susie. She's expecting me to come. You still trying to fix me up with your daughter? Uh, Susie, uh, no, no. I'm fine. I just thought I'd let you know there's a change in plans. I won't be there tonight. I do? Well, I don't know. I'll let you know when I find out. Okay, bye. You'll never guess what she said. She said, "I hope it's because you got lucky." How did you know? Well, did you, hmm? [CHUCKLES] I'll let you know when I find out. [INDISTINCT POLICE RADIO CHATTER] It's okay. When we were getting the pizza, I switched the plates with another van that was there. Hey, where is everybody? They went on to San Diego. We'll meet them there. Not me, not the way I feel. Oh, come on, Andy. You're okay. Okay? Eighteen stitches and a concussion, why do you think they held me overnight? Well, listen, if you feel that bad, I'll drive the bike. The hell you will. Nobody rides my bike but me. Look, I'm gonna get some breakfast and head back to LA. I want to go to San Diego! Everybody's waiting for us there. We'll have a ball. You coming or staying? See you around. You'd really do it, wouldn't you? Damn right. You know, somebody should have knocked you in the head a long time ago. How is she? We finally got her to sleep early this morning. What about you? Have you had any sleep? No, but we got everything covered. We're going to get this guy. You look like you're half dead. Why don't you take a break? We'll go down to the cafeteria, have a little breakfast, let somebody else take over for a while, all right? Mmm-mmm. Not this one. No one is going to take this one over. Sam, you can hardly keep your eyes open. What are you going to do? Go on the freeway, drive a hundred miles an hour, maybe get in a shootout and then you're going to get killed? Wait a minute, wait a minute. We've been through all this before. It's my job, Laureen. Yeah, it's the way you want it, Sam, the way you've always wanted it. I guess the way you always will want it. Well, I can't live with it anymore. Laureen.Stop kidding yourself, will you? You're nothing but a big kid, you like going out and driving fast and having bad guys shoot at you. That's right. I work out there on that road and you're right, I do like it. Well, find yourself another lady, Sam. Find somebody who'll have your kids. Find somebody who can live with the fact that the next time she sees you, you may be dead. Here we go, Mrs. Pearson. Thank you. Oh, I really don't know what I was thinking. I just wanted to go swimming. I didn't want you to stop me. Maybe it was the champagne, my head was full of so many things, and when I was in the ocean, it felt so good, so good and clean and I just kept swimming the way I used to, on and on. Oh, Juno. Albert, we both know I don't have much time. We don't talk about it, but it may be only a few months, that's why you you've been doing all these sweet things for me, I know. My darling, I didn't want you to have to wait for me to die and spend all that we've saved trying to make my last days beautiful. I wanted to save you all that. I just wanted to make it easier and quicker. I understand, but don't you know... I value every moment with you, every moment. And so do I, with you. Albert, can we go back home now? I want very much to be home with you. Sure. [DALE SINGING] Tomorrow, tomorrow we can drop your car off in San Diego, and hit the road by noon. And where will we be tomorrow night? Ah, tomorrow night. I know this great little spot just out of Santa Rosa, New Mexico. Bougainvillea on the windows, nice cantina right across the road. Did you ever see the desert sky at night? It's a bowl of stars. And what happens when we get to Texas? What do you mean, what happens? What do we do? Where do we stay? We'll, uh, worry about that when the time comes. I can't do it, Dale. You can't do what? I can't go with you. I'm going back to Los Angeles. Hey, wait a minute now, just, just wait a minute. Now, last night you said that you couldn't jump into bed with a guy you just met and you did and it was beautiful. Now, you're turning this into a one night stand and I thought that you wanted something more than that. I do. But it's just too soon. What do you got to lose? A boring job, an empty house, what, what? I know you're right. I wish I had the courage, but I don't. You don't do it now, you never will. Not even breakfast? I'm sorry. Don't mention it. Uh, Capistrano, this is 86-503. FEMALE DISPATCHER: 86-503, go ahead. Uh, 11, 28, 10, 29. License plate L158259, please check. He's still following us! Oh, relax, the plates check out to another van, remember? Don't worry about it. Capistrano, ten-four. Next stop, Big Sur. Give me a peanut. Damn it! No! [HONKING HORN] [HONKING HORN] Hey, Sam, got anything yet?Nothing. You know, I thought I saw the van we're looking for, same color and everything, even had a couple of kids in it. License didn't check. This one had a sign painted on the back, "This Van Rated X." What? Oh, damn it, how the hell could I forget about it? Where was it? It was the wrong license number.Where the hell was it! The Ortega on-ramp, they got on the freeway heading north. Get on the radio. That's the van. [TIRES SCREECHING] DORIS: Capistrano to all units.
