THE BLACK SEA CONSTANTINOPLE OTTOMAN EMPIRE THE KARAMANID EMIRATE Halfway through the 15th century, in the era of Murad II... MOLDAVIA WALLACHIA ...Eflak, as the Romanians called it, the region of Wallachia, was annexed by the Ottoman Empire without bloodshed. The Prince of Wallachia, as an assurance of his loyalty, conceded her sons, Radu and Vlad, to Murad II. Murad II brought Vlad to Edirne Palace, and made sure that he got the same education with his own son, Prince Mehmed. And that's how, the Prince Mehmed, who would become known as "the Conqueror," and Vlad, who would become infamous as "the Impaler," met. In the centuries-long battle between good and evil, a new page was being written in the ancient books of history. This was a battle of justice... and tyranny. Earth... air... water... fire. The universe rests upon these four pillars. The same wind fills everyone's lungs with their first breath and the same soil covers everything with its last breath. You plant two seeds in the fertile ground, and you feed them with the same pure water so that their roots find life. Both breathe the same air as they grow up. But one of them turns out to be an oleander... and the other, a rose. Mehmed! Both oleanders and roses can thrive on these lands. Vlad! But when the oleander spreads its poison... the owner of the land has no choice but to rip it off and throw it away. If a fire burns the innocent, we will always have enough water to put it out... and enough wind to disperse its ashes. By the royal decree of His Excellency, Sultan Mehmed II, Son of Sultans, Father of Conquerors. "You, the Vaivode of the Eflak Province, Vlad III Dracula, I have been informed that you've chosen to be the 'Son of the Dragon' and the 'Heir of the Devil' over being our brother. That you, who grew up at our mercy, forgot what mercy is. That you sit on the throne we gifted upon you so that you'd become a just ruler... only to tyrannize people. We have never punished your heresy, but your tyranny will be stopped. Effective immediately, if even a single innocent soul is harmed or a single drop of blood is shed, you will pay--" Ottoman Turkish. I've missed it. "You will pay the price, and your punishment will be as severe as your tyrannical acts." If you wish to beg for mercy, do so. So you can benefit from... our Sultan's endless mercy. Look, Envoy... You know that turban on your head? It reminds me of terrible things. It reminds me of the terrible days I had in that Ottoman palace. Its ugly gardens, its filthy smell... all those weird guys with turbans... The shenanigans of that spoiled brat, Mehmed. Alright? Now, when I see your turban... I remember those endless nights, the dark nights that I cried constantly throughout my entire childhood. Remove that immediately. That turban will be my shroud. I will die... before I remove it. Alright, your call. I'm going to do you a favor. You will never be apart from the turban that you seem to love so much. Do you believe the Ottomans will sit and watch when the heretics rebel? Our brave men will crush you until your evil reign is over! You will not get away with this! Never! The bird has been freed. You should free yourself from your burden as well, my Sultan. Baba Sultan... that son of a bitch, Vlad, who became vaivoda by our grace is terrorizing our people. And as if that's not enough, he butchered the envoy who was relaying our final warning. We must react to this insolence. Whatever you feel... and whatever you think... will be written in the pages of history, my Sultan. What will happen to Vlad will spread throughout seven lands and three continents as a lesson for everyone. You have your mission. Let the valiant sons of the Ottomans know. When the decision is made... The decree of our Sultan is law. Skywolf. Allahu Akbar. He... blessed the humankind with life from his own soul. Allahu Akbar. He blessed them with ears, eyes, and hearts. But then, the humankind, hearts filled with delusion, strayed from the true path. They ravaged, they destroyed, they tortured. They are the ones who woved to eradicate the Earth of tyranny. -This is my oath! -This is my oath! Let it be carved into stone if I fall in the battlefield! What happened to me was always destined! They're the ones who became Ali's Zulfiqar... and the justice of Omar. They're the ones who buried their own pain and wore death as their armor. They're the ones who died so that others survive. Earth was their bed and the skies their quilt. They're the ones who walked alone and shed light upon the darkness with their weapons. They're... the Valiants. We heard your call... and came to you, Baba Sultan. You have our swords. Who is Omar? The father of our order. Who is Ali? Our champion. What is the battlefield? It is where we belong. What is battle? Our lover. For whom will we die? Our Sultan. When will our journey end? When there's unity. Who is your companion? The Valiants! What do they call you? The Valiants! The tyrant has crossed the line... and we have run out of patience. What do you think will follow? The time for words and forgiveness... is no more. Why do we call our empire the Motherland, Skywolf? Because a mother never abandons her children. You are both the sons... and the empire itself. Don't ever feel discouraged, thinking you're alone. And never let any of our children think that they're alone. You have your decree... and your mission. Wield your weapons at once! Start your journey at once! Punish the tyrant at once! The reflection of my soul... hangs around your neck. As long as my head is on my shoulders... this secret... will rest on my heart. The secret rests on your heart. May your mission go well. What's going on? Where am I? Calm down. Calm down, Niku, I'm healing you. His Excellency, Vlad III. Your Excellency. Is my weapon ready, Alchemist? After I infected the rats with the plague, the red moss was ineffective. But when I gave them the red moss first, I couldn't keep the rats in order. Cut the stories. When is my weapon going to be ready? When? I've achieved a lot already, your Excellency. Sir... you're going to conquer every city with this weapon. Walls, houses, palaces... None of them will be harmed. But all life in them will cease to exist. All of them. People, animals... even insects. Do you need anything? Rats, your Excellency. -They've all died during the experiments. -Anything else? And red moss. They will go rabid when I feed them the red moss. -Get him whatever he wants! -Yes, sir. Right now! If you accomplish what you're planning, Constantinople will fall overnight and the Turks will run away tails between their legs. I don't want to conquer just one city, Alchemist. What I want is to alter the course of history. So, finish the weapon at once. I don't want you to end up like him. I will, your Excellency. The Valiants are a fairy tale. No, they're not. My grandfather saw them. They told me how they fought. The Valiants don't exist. Father said they're an old folk tale, told to scare the children. No! The Valiants are real. I know they are! -Guys, soldiers are coming! -Soldiers? -Soldiers! Run! -Soldiers! Gather around! Listen to me. We will pay gold for any rats you can find. Gold? How much? Don't come near me, you filthy leper! We will pay a sack of gold for each cage filled with rats. Come on! Go find some! Any news from the Alchemist? Yeah. Just wait till the weapon is finished, Elizabeth. Mehmed and all those goat-herding Turks who follow him won't even have the power to flee back to their Asian steppes. I will destroy Mehmed, Elizabeth. I will erase him from history, and no one will remember his name! No one! Just wait till it's ready. They will all die from the illness. Plague, illness, hunger! They will attack the palace, you'll see! I will bury him in the same city that got him the title of Conqueror! The Holy Father stands besides you in your holy cause. You know, there's nothing we can't do with the Pope's power. The Pope has no power, Elizabeth. He may fool others, but not me. Idiots, bathing their babies in their so-called holy water. Morons. They even get in line just to get some wine and bread. But me, Elizabeth? With these hands, all on my own... I'm going to give Turks hell. You're the greatest commander Wallachia has ever had. But don't forget... with the Pope by your side, your reign will expand beyond limits. My reign has no limits and boundries already, Elizabeth. Because I am the Son of God. I am God's wrath on Earth, Elizabeth! When will we get our gold? Does anyone else want some gold? There shan't be a victim without a decree There shan't be a battlefield Without a lion There shan't be a victim without a decree There shan't be a battlefield Without a lion Master, what is Kuman singing about? The song means that you shouldn't brag in a battlefield... and that you shouldn't cry over the fallen. He may be right... but you can't always help what you feel. I couldn't get to him. I couldn't save him. I buried my brother. A pain worse than death. Aşgar. Come and eat something. We have a long journey ahead of us. Aşgar, come on, brother. Come on. The closest path to Târgovişte is through here. But it is very dangerous. Vlad's thugs patrol around here, so we might have to fight them. We must choose the safest path, which is through the north. If Vlad's thugs patrol around the villages... our path should go right through them. Veterans! Our Sultan's decree... is not about one person's blood... but about all innocents. We shall pray... and wield our weapons... for their sake only. We will go through here. This time, it'll work. This time, you're all ready. My little soldiers. The Princess is waiting for you outside. I'm coming. My Princess... Tell me. How are we doing, Alchemist? -The red moss worked, Princess. -Oh? We're practically ready. "Practically." Are we ready or not? We are ready, Princess. No one can stand against the one who wields this weapon. We can give him the good news, then. Grandpa! Grandpa! Where have you been? I was worried about you so much, son. Rats! Rats, Grandpa! Calm down. Just catch your breath. What did you see? What did you hear? Some soldiers came by the homeless' street. They made them collect rats. And they killed some old guy just because he asked for gold. Then they put the rats in cages and left. They took them to some magician guy. He talked to the Princess. Look at me. No one saw you, right? No, Grandpa, I'm sure. Were you able to hear what they said? They were talking about some weapon. A weapon that no one can stand against. How's your brother, Havva? Thank God, he's okay. Thank God indeed. If our Prince, Vlad, isn't satisfied with what you do... he won't kill you. Do you know why? Because I would've killed you already. Gold, silver... Pick up anything precious! Kill every single one of them! Dad? -Welcome, dear. -You should eat something. I know this is yogurt, but what is this? It's good for you. Tell me what it is first. It doesn't taste good, but it'll help with your cough. Come on, don't be so stubborn! They're coming, run! Wait here. Stay here. -Dad! -Do what I tell you and stay here! Stay away! Stay back. Stay away! Mute. Go check for any survivors. Don't be scared. We won't hurt the innocent. Sister... Sister, stop crying. The ones who died are free of the wrath of the Earth. And your father is a martyr now. He is in heaven now. May Allah bless us with martyrdom as well. Please! Please, don't die! Please! Someone help! -Please don't die. -Help! Anyone? Please, help! Someone, please help! Someone, please help! Please help my mother, don't let her die. Please! Please help. Good job, kid. We wouldn't be able to find you if you weren't screaming this loud. Please, don't let her die! Please, help! Don't you worry. I will relieve her of all suffering. From now on... know when to shut up... and when to speak. Now, tell me, Fisherman. With how many fish did our Lord, Jesus Christ... feed five thousand people? Two, Vicar. So... where's the other fish? In the orphans' belly, sir. So... I accept this fish as a tribute to the orphans. Do you have anyone? Not anymore. My real family was slaughtered in a town plundered by Vlad's thugs. My blacksmith father... was one of the Turkmens the Empire sent to the Balkans. Vlad took all of my relatives, one by one. Lakum denokum wa lia deeni. You have your religion, and I have mine. No one gets bullied in the Ottoman Empire because of their religion. Don't hide it. Hey! Hey, what are you doing? You can't feed a baby like that! Pardon me, your Excellency. All the bandits we sent to the south have been killed. This is the only one who escaped. This the only one who did what? Escaped. Your Excellency... Yeah? Sir... they appeared out of nowhere. Out of nowhere? He had wings. Wings, you say? They were wearing fur. -They looked like monsters! -Monsters? They slaughtered every one of us! Every one of you? Then why are you here? How many of them... were there? Come. Have a drink. You've come from afar, come on. How many of you were there? Huh? How many of them were there? How many? Costel... find them. Wield all the weapons God gave you... in order to withstand the Devil's tricks. Because our fight is not with the people, but with the rulers, emperors, the dark powers of this Earth, the spiritual armies of evil who reside in celestial places. "We speak to the Moon at night, and we sleep during the day." I'm not sleeping. I'm thinking. Did he raise you? He teaches me the cause and the path. Why do they call you Nameless? Is it a nickname? You have to deserve a name before you get one. The name is one with one's destiny. There's a saying, "The brave must be able to carry his name." That's why he has to prove his skills in the battlefield first. I will have my name when this journey ends, hopefully. But I won't have one until it's over. There's a gypsy camp around here. Let's leave the baby with them. Giddyup! Honey, you look so feisty! This is your night, stud! Come on! They look so weird. Hey, get their horses! The baby is hungry. It needs rest. We can provide food and a bed. Where did you come from and where are you going? We came from somewhere, we're going somewhere else. Are you the mother? No. Are you the father? Why are you nodding? Are you the father? I found... both the girl and the baby in a pillaged village. You can eat and drink whatever you want. You're in luck, we have a wedding! Let's just rest somewhere. You go ahead and have fun. What are you looking at, idiots? They're our guests! Come on, let's have fun! Viorel... Viorel... Viorel... Viorel... Viorel... From you, from your blood... an army of thousands shall rise. My little soldiers. Eat. Go on, eat. Eat and get stronger for our holy cause. It was so fast, we don't even know how it happened. They got every Jew where we live. Some of them were killed. And some lucky ones, like us, managed to escape. We're grateful to the Turks. Our so-called friends never helped us. But the Ottomans we don't even know welcomed us. Anyway. What's your story? Kongar! You're killing me here! You damn snake. Shalom alechem. I brought you some soup. You must be hungry. They say it's the best soup around here. I don't even remember how much I had since I came here. Cheers. Nameless. Thanks, we already ate. Where are you going? To our way. You don't look local. Where are you from? He's a guest, just like you. He escaped from Vlad's tyranny. He's from Târgovişte. Do you have anyone, then? Remember? You asked me back then. So I'm curious too. I do. Anyone besides them? Your mother? Your father? Any siblings? I haven't seen my father or my mother since I was six. Our path is not one you can have a family, Alaca. God... Your pal who never speaks wouldn't give up the baby. He loves it for some reason. Well, it's hard to leave what you love. -Good night. -To you as well, warrior. Let him sleep. He wouldn't rest until the baby fell asleep. Mute! Alaca. We're leaving. Our path is not good for women and children. They're good people. Trustworthy people. You'll be comfortable with them. You need to stay here. The thugs who murdered my father weren't just random bandits. They were Vlad's soldiers. They will come for you. Death is the least painful thing on our path. If they won't come for us, we will go after them anyway. It's easier if the enemy is behind us. But you shouldn't worry about that. I trust you with the baby, and I trust Allah to keep you safe. Our suffering and our destiny is one with it now. That baby is your gift to me. I will dedicate my life to him as long as I breathe. Oh, you're already leaving? -Mute. -Just give it to me. -Mute! -Miriam. Miriam, come on! Take the baby, Miriam. Mute! Let go of the baby. Come on. Go inside, Miriam. Take care of Mute's son. Alaca. You're a brave woman. May Allah protect you. Whenever I lose everyone... an Ottoman comes to my aid. Think of me as one of you. Godspeed. The only kid we were able to save from the Turkmen village. Vlad's bandits slaughtered her entire family. When I visit our Father, Allah, I will tell him all about their tyranny. You don't have to visit Allah... to tell him about their tyranny. He has already heard you. He has heard you... and sent his lions to avenge your family. The Papal Envoy is here for you, your Excellency. Well, well, well... His Eminence the Pope was very pleased to hear that you were kicking the heathen Turks out of your lands. He has ordered me to tell you that he has accepted you as the protector of the entire Christian domain. This is why he has sent you this special crown. This crown symbolizes that your status is of equal importance with all the cardinals in the eyes of the Papacy. Yeah? Such an honor. You are now the guardian of whoever believes in Jesus Christ. Tell that Pope of yours... I am neither a protector nor a slave to anyone. After I eradicate Mehmed, if your Pope doesn't wish to see his throne get upside down... he will accept that I am the Son of God. I am the Son of God. Tell your master that I forgive his insolence... for now. Mübariz. You never open your eyes until the Moon rises, but I know you're awake. Humankind has always loved the Sun. But me... I keep my eyes closed during the day to appease the Moon. Just so the Moon doesn't think no one sees its beauty and feel sad. Does the sun in your lands scorch the Earth like this too, Mübariz? Huh, brother? Ours scorches even more... but you wouldn't dare get burnt, so that it doesn't get offended and withhold its light. Where I'm from, our wind, our water, our soil, are truly something else. When you look up at the sky, you see the blueness of the Caspian. I miss it. You know, brother... if you can't reach something... you won't dare to miss it. Mute... My dear brother, Mute. Still thinking about the baby? Being apart is difficult. I know. But this is for his own sake. Our path is filled with thorns. It reeks of death. Death is what we live for. You did everything you could for that innocent soul. The rest is in Allah's hands. Thinking this much won't help you... or him. Psst, Mute! You can't shut your mouth, can you? Why the hell are you entertained, Kongar? A man shouldn't act like a clown. Yeah, right. Kongar! Are you mad, Kaşgar? Huh, brother? Draw your weapon and bash his head in. But you must know that you would be killing yourself... not Kongar. Oh, you! Wanna know why? Just like you lost count how many lives you've taken in the battlefield... he also doesn't know how many people he buried. After a certain point, you become callous. A constant smile settles in your face... just like it's been carved with a dagger. And then... you either stop talking altogether like Mute did... or you constantly laugh at the face of this treacherous world. You will laugh, brother. You will. Just because he isn't the same as you... don't think for a moment that he's any different. Don't do it, brother. We'll get the wolves... and they'll get the news. We'll get the news. They'll get the jackals, and we'll get the wolves. They'll get the news, and we'll-- Wake up, Kuman. We set you free so you wake yourself and others up, not so you sleep. Let the ones sleeping rise. Let their hearts burn just like iron going into fire. Before the skies go red and the ground turns into mud, let all sons stand up and fight. Open your eyes, Kuman. Open your heart. Open your soul. Spread your wings. Wrap their wounds with your wings. We swear by the horses that breathe thunder... and by the heavenly wolves, you are not alone. We... are the righteous. Draw your weapons! Mute, Kuman! Aşgar! Kongar! Kongar! Kongar... Kongar! Kongar, are you okay, brother? Kongar, don't let go! -Mübariz? -Vlad's thugs. Kongar... Kongar, open your eyes, brother. Open your eyes. Open them. Smiling suits you. I swear I won't get mad, just smile! Kongar, just laugh! Kongar! Kongar! Aşgar. From now on, you're on different paths. Let him go. No. Kongar will hold on. He will recover. We will continue together. The duty won't wait. -Just go. -I said no. Maybe we'll find a village, a healer. Maybe the healer will have some ointment. Maybe he'll get better. He's resilient. He will survive. Aşgar... Kongar wouldn't have wanted you to cry for him. He would've wanted you to become a legend in the battlefield. Do the right thing, brother. Hail thee... my Valiants. Hail thee. Hail thee. Your debt is piling up, Viktor! This is your last drink! Bring some wine. No need! Just water. Anyone else? No one? Isn't there any man in this tavern who will stand against me? You all fell silent, just like the Turks, Vlad impaled. You're eating like a bunch of starving orphans! Oh, boy. Veterans... -we must find clean water. -Nameless. Got it, master. Wait! What are you doing here? I'm also going to Târgovişte. You wouldn't take me with you if I asked. So I followed you. Well, you followed us for nothing. You can't come with us. Mübariz! Nameless... Nameless... Nameless! I... I sent him here! Mübariz... I sent him here, Skywolf. It was my fault. Mübariz! -I sent him here! -Mübariz! They obviously didn't kill him, brother. They took him. We will find Nameless. -But I sent him here... -We will find him, brother. We will. We will find Nameless, Mübariz. Don't you worry. We will find him. Nameless! You said the most strong soldiers are the Turkish Valiants. But my dad told me. Our Prince, Vlad, has waged war against the Turks. I heard he's pillaging the neighboring villages. If the Valiants were real, they would've saved the villages. My dad told me that they'll all run away soon. Welcome. You know, duty. Karalı of the Valiants. We are not well at all, brother. I know, brother, I know. It's time to settle some accounts. He's one of us. He's the fisherman's grandson. He has no one else. Let's not talk here, Skywolf. Go to the boathouse. I'm leaving you with a hero. Eren will take you to the boathouse. Let's go, Valiants. Let's go, kid. Come on. The secret rests on your heart. The secret rests on my heart. Sir, please have mercy. I beg you. I beg you. Well, well, well... So this is our hero. Who are you? Huh? Who are you? Who are you? Alright, then. You don't want to talk. Let's find out if the fairy tales are correct. Who are you people? Hold him. Hold him! Interesting. I'd believe the tales if I didn't know better. Who are you people? -Your Excellency. -Yeah? It's important. Make him talk. There's some movement in the south, sir. Well, well, well. You were nameless, but now you have a nickname. Fingerless. There's an underground passage to Vlad's castle. I bet he has some soldiers there, but I doubt there are too many. But... we have a more pressing issue. What issue, Karalı? Vlad's working on a secret weapon in a cave near the castle. What kind of weapon, Karalı? They'll spread the plague using rats. They make the rats go rabid by combining a plague victim's blood and flesh with some sort of red moss. And then they'll release the rats. So this butcher is planning to kill everyone with a plague. We, since we were little kids, grew up together in the Order of the Valiant. We swung our swords in many battlefields. We killed. We died. But... they have Nameless. So we will invade that demon's den as soon as possible. Karalı, can you destroy those rats on your own? You bet. You have your mission, then. We will find the secret passage. May Allah... bless your body and your soul. Give us your blessing. We came to be with a splash of water... and we will cease to exist with a handful of soil. You have my blessing. Give me your blessing as well. It is yours. Then, good luck to all of us. May Allah be with us. Someone brave brought us here. You've raised him well. May Allah bless him. Yes, I have. You're strong. Are you going to be a wrestler? No. I will join the Order of the Valiant, just like you. What was your name? Eren. We'll be glad to have you, Eren. Very glad. Father, it is I, your son. They're coming to cast lightning upon your son. They're coming to slaughter your son, Father. I hope you won't leave me alone like he did. You won't leave me alone like that Wallachian peasant did, who thought he was my father. That ignorant, inferior, incompetent man. Don't leave me alone like that sell-out Prince did, who left a little kid with the enemy in an Ottoman palace. I am your son. I've known since the beginning. You, who everyone calls God, who everyone fears, are my father. You shall gift the entire world to me and I shall baptise the humankind with fire and death. But if you're going to abandon me, don't ever forget that I won't accept defeat as easily as that carpenter from Nazareth, who people call Jesus. He bowed down to the Roman army. But I've never bowed down to anyone and I will never do it. If you let me lose against those heathen, barbaric Turks... if I die and get lost in the dark, your name shall be left in the dark forever as well. It's your call... Father. Nameless. Nameless... Nameless... Master... I didn't talk, master! Veterans... the time... has come. The time for martyrdom has come. Let the ones who we kill become carcasses. Let Zulfiqar be one with our weapons. Hail thee, Valiants. Hail thee. Hail thee. Hail thee, Valiants! Hail thee! Are they here to kill the Son of God? -This is my oath! -This is my oath! I will not stop until my weapon is destroyed and my body is torn apart! -This is my oath! -This is my oath! This is my oath! Heretics and all kinds of tyrants shall taste our blades! Idiots. -This is my oath! -This is my oath! I will not stop until I crush the crusaders' crown and take their heads! This is my oath! This is my oath! I will not visit Allah nor my Sultan until I raise my banner in the seven lands and three continents! -This is my oath! -This is my oath! My ruler is the Ottoman Empire... and my guide is the prophet, Muhammad the Trustworthy! -This is my oath! -This is my oath! Let it be carved into stone if I fall in the battlefield! What happened to me was always destined! Hush. Calm down, now. Attack! End this nonsense! End it! Why do we call our empire the Motherland, Skywolf? Because a mother never abandons her children. Go! Attack! From now on, know when to shut up... and when to speak. Mom, please don't die! Please! Good job, kid. We wouldn't be able to find you if you weren't screaming this loud. There shan't be a victim without a decree There shan't be a battlefield Without a lion There shan't be a victim without a decree There shan't be a battlefield Without a lion There shan't be a victim without a decree There shan't be a battlefield Without a lion Master... what is Kuman singing about? Hail thee... Valiants. Hail thee! Hail thee! You don't have the power to defeat us. Even your descendants shall never see us defeated. You let the Turks have me... for the second time, Father. So you have decided. You can't kill me. You can't. Your god doesn't have a son... but my Allah... has entire armies! In the name of Allah! Let their bodies lie on our left, and their heads on our right! Nameless. My brave boy. You've made your master proud. Hamza... Hamza, Hunter of Lions. Your name is not Nameless from now on. I hereby name you Hamza. You now have the same name as the Patron of the Martyrs... and you are now a comrade to all fallen Valiants. Hail thee... Valiants! Hail thee. They are the ones who die before they fall. They are the ones who come back with a vengeance. They are the ones who drown the tyrants in their own blood and expel the darkness with the sparks from their weapons. They're the ones who destroy thrones and crowns, and then return to the mountains. They're the ones who make the world tremble... but lie alone in their nameless graves. Hail thee, Valiants. They're the ones who face death willingly so that others don't face it. They're the first ones to go. They're the ones who never come back. They are... the Valiants. Let it be carved into stone... if I fall in the battlefield. What happened to me... was always destined. Hail thee, Valiants! Hail thee! Perhaps no one will ever know who they were. But until the story of humankind ends, the legend of the Valiants will live on. Hail thee, Valiants! Hail thee, Valiants! Hail thee! This is not over.
