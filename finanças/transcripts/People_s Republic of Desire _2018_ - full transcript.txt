(people chatting) (ominous music starts) (female hosts singing) (host greeting fans) Hello, everyone. My name is Dabao. My job is to train and manage live streaming hosts. How can you become a top host? Now it's hard to make fans stay. You must keep them engaged. Every patron begins as an ordinary fan. Then he may start to buy you gifts, and later patronize you exclusively. Only you can make that happen. Each time before live streaming, rehearse and make yourself look good. Keep your fans happy. Keep your patrons happy. Then you'll live like goddesses. (mouse click) (voices greeting fans) Without anyone noticing, it seems that... live streaming has become the hottest online trend in China. With a computer, a webcam, a pair of earphones and a mic, you can live stream at home. Eating, singing, gaming, shopping, and talking... There are all kinds. An online celebrity could make up to $200k a month. I'm late. (dynamic music starts) OK! Good evening, everyone! Have you eaten? Love you! Kiss kiss. Welcome to showroom 2391. Oh you had dinner. Let's listen to a song. Thanks, Little Fish. I play League of Legends too. But I suck at the game. Time for lollipops. (Shen Man sings) Flowers! I've liked her for almost 2 years. My goal is to find a girlfriend just like her. I consider her a role model. She can achieve everything I can't. So awesome. Agree. I've fantasized about her before. But reality sucks. I've learned to accept reality. Now I view her as my goddess. Let me clarify my relationship with host Danzong. You all think he's my boyfriend. I swear by my breasts - if I lie, they'll stop growing. What do you mean? The lucky ones are born with big breasts. But others need "developmental" help. Just like real estate in China, you never know the great potential of things to be developed. Likewise, you'll be surprised once my flat chest gets "developed." Big Boobs - that's what you'll call me. (Shen Man typing) People of my age don't know computers. Those born in the '90s are all computer experts. Even little kids can grab a phone and play all sorts of games. We can't. We can't keep up with them. This society is progressing too fast. This is YY's live streaming platform. It enables ordinary people to become internet idols. Fans spend real money to buy VIP titles and virtual gifts. Online performers and YY then split the proceeds. (rapid keyboard typing) I'm coaching a hostess... on how to... present her best self in front of a web cam. I'm most proud of having trained many hosts. The most number of hosts. Like Shen Man, I helped her grow... from zero. Mommy, mommy. Oh, here you are. I love you very much. Let mommy hold you and play you a disc. Who's this? Tell mommy who this is. -A big sister. -What big sister? This is mommy and daddy. (sharp digital beeping) (dynamic music starts) [MC] Whether you are a die-hard fan, or new to Big Li's showroom, today you'll witness the beginning of a new era - the third anniversary of Big Li and his army of fans on YY. A diaosi loser who has turned YY upside down. He is the emperor of all diaosi losers. He looks like a bum. His voice is hoarse. But like the brightest star in the night sky, he lights up the path for every diaosi. He makes us believe losers can succeed too. As the saying goes - even a slut can become a virgin, and a diaosi can finally win! First I'd like to welcome honored guests, every generous patron, and every friend in my showroom. Y'all know I'm good at fanning up emotions. Crying is my specialty. Once my tears brought me $16k in gifts. If I cry now, this room would surely go nuts. These young people are called diaosis. Diaosi used to be a vulgar term. Now young people of poor looks and low income... use it as a self-deprecating label. China is different from 20 years ago. Social mobility has decreased. Those lower middle class and diaosi losers, they feel despair - there's no opportunity for them. In real life, perhaps... many things are beyond your reach. But online they are all possible. Thanks for giving me everything in the past 3 years - a car, a house, a kid, and a family. If we hadn't met 3 years ago, if you had chosen to support others, then all my screaming and yelling... without your being my audience, who'd appreciate my so-called talent? (street noise) Please enjoy your tea, sir. I'm 18, and I've been working for 4 years. When I was 3, my father passed away, and my mother remarried. I was raised by my grandpa, and grew up all alone. I feel very lonely. Sometimes I really want to **find someone to have a heart to heart. But it's very difficult. It rarely happens. I watch YY just for fun. To kill some time. But watching Big Li feels different. In my heart, he's my idol. When I made my first $80k, my family still didn't own a house. When I bought our first house at 22, my dad asked if I had the money. I smiled and told him - "Nothing for you to worry about." My dad smiled back. My sense of pride then... No amount of money... can ever buy that. (canned laughter) (lively music starts) People say men look most handsome when they smoke. Mr. Driver, do you want one? -Don't worry about me. You enjoy first. How old are you? I was born in 1990. Oh, then I'm five years older. My hometown is only an hour away from Beijing. I came to Beijing when I was 16. My father and I did migrant construction work. A big group of us were hauled here in a truck. Now I'm 25. It's been 8, 9 years. Weiliang needs your photo, for the campaign's home page. Let's take one now. That Liaoning Hotel in Beijing... He worked at that hotel before, as a security guard. Opening doors to cars and rooms. That's what you did then, right? You've done well. Now I'm almost the richest in my village. Once I have $2 million, I'll be the richest in my village. (dog barking) As the youngest, I'd like to toast all the elders. Bottoms up! - Nephew, I'd like to say a few words. You're the pride of two generations. You've brought honor to the entire Li clan. A great achievement. We are proud of you. -No matter what, I'm still a kid to you guys. One more thing... no matter how successful you are, we'll never be satisfied. Uncle, I can promise you this - First, I won't fall. Second, I'll do even better. -Exactly. Let's all drink to that! (lively music resumes) -He should buy more real estate, right? -Yeah. I'll come back when I'm old. There's no fucking place... like home. (car honking) The beauty returns. I listened to you sing online that day. I told my daughter this singing beauty likes my fish. Show them to the table! -Coming! We didn't understand it, back in Guangdong. She was young then. Every night she stayed up late playing online, singing and howling in her room. The path I chose for her... I sent her to nursing school. Who knew she would pursue this? Nobody could've guessed. Of course it's my... great fortune to have such a successful child. Rice, please. Actually, the way she grew up was... pretty awful. When she was one, we left her with her grandma. When she was eight, her mother and I divorced. She grew up without a mother. I need some change to buy medicine. -For what? -My cold. -Nothing left at home? -I finished it a long time ago. My dad ended his business. He's... bankrupt. Nowadays... he has no income, no job. When he first moved in with me, I didn't like it at all. But regardless, he's my father. ♪ I should have known that bubbles ♪ ♪ They burst upon a gentle touch ♪ ♪ Just like a fragile heart ♪ ♪ That can suffer no more ♪ This was her at 14. During the years Shen Man and her sister were growing up, their mother never cared for them. This had a big emotional impact on them. Whenever her mom is mentioned, she immediately shuts down. Change the topic, or she bolts. Though we live together now, we don't talk much. It's difficult to communicate with her. Perhaps she feels... I'm not doing anything now. She has to pay for everything for us. This creates pressure for her. ♪ Even the most beautiful flower ♪ ♪ Withers after blooming ♪ ♪ Even the shiniest star ♪ ♪ Flashes and then falls ♪ Yo, patron Tiange is here! Are you here to buy me gifts? I don't understand YY. I don't know how money is made here. Sometimes I'm shocked by how easy it is. (suspenseful music starts) It's like a love triangle. Once many diaosis watch your show, Tuhao refers to those with money, but with no culture or value. Tuhao wants attention from the host and diaosis. When he spends, diaosis applaud - (crowd cheering and applauding) When you get bored with real-life excesses, you go seek new thrills online. I need to find something to do besides trading stocks. My social circle is too small. This is very addictive. Fans follow you if you spend a lot. They love to chat with you. They value the opportunity to talk to someone rich. My thinking is - Wow, so many people want to chat with me! At the beginning I spent at least... $150k a month, sometimes more than that. Now I'm more rational. I'm keeping my spending under $35k a month. My business? It's hard to talk about it, as I'm a profiteer. Welcome Songge to our showroom. (canned laughter) Oh my god, Songge. Songge's gifts are giving me hot flashes. Buying them gifts gives me a great sense of achievement. Fans put me on a pedestal. Hosts will do whatever I tell them. Thanks for Songge's support! You are so incredible*** Don't stop. Please don't! (rapid mouse clicks) Come on. Let's toast Big Li for keeping us patrons close. Big Li's patrons are loyal. They never spend on other hosts. The competition is a month away. How much will you spend? Some say you have $160k ready. -Isn't it $1.6 million? -Remove a zero. At least $16k from me, I've told him. -You never mentioned any minimum. You promised to try your best. I'll try my best. You know how your fans are talking? If 130k fans each spends $15, imagine how much money that is. Big Li will surely win. That's what they told me. -Let's toast to our drinking friendship. -Alcohol truly tests the depth of friendships. I'll drink till I fall. -All for the upcoming battle! (various voices speaking) It's Beijing time 19:47 now, ladies and gentlemen. This is the grand opening ceremony of the annual competition. YY Annual Competition attracts** the most attention each year. The contestants have just been announced. The intense competition will be held from Dec 5 to Dec 20. A bloodless war... is about to begin. Who do you support? Hello, everyone. I am Shen Man. I am Lige. I am Wen'er. I am Picasso. Best Female Idol. Best Host. Best Hostess. Best Male Idol. December 6, I'm ready. I'm ready. I, am ready. The annual competition is the most important event on YY. Whether you'll continue to succeed in the coming year, it all depends on this competition. If you can win No. 1 or No. 2, every YY user will know you. Instant fame! When do hosts receive the most gifts? The annual competition. A host's monthly income then... could exceed $1.5 million. If you like me, please follow my showroom. (dance music playing) I got paid today. I'm charging my account to buy votes for Shen Man. I'll probably spend $800 in this competition. My monthly income is... about $600. In order to win, you need fans to buy you votes. I finally managed to save $50 to splurge a little. (mouse click) Flash my votes! Fuck, he didn't thank me! My 3 dollars... He didn't even thank me! Thanks to patrons Goddess and Unique. Thanks to patrons Quan and Wu. Look at how strong my support is this year! What time is it? -This round ends at 11pm. -It's 10:30pm now. - Shouldn't it end at 12am? - No, 11pm. - 11pm, you sure? - Yes. The alert says only one hour left. OK, keep eating. I need to start my show. (slurping and chewing loudly) Be quiet when you eat. It's getting crazy. I'm knocked down to No. 10? Thanks for everyone's votes. The Best Hostess category has gone crazy. I'm only No. 10 with 170k votes? What should I do? I'm not safe. Hurry with your votes! (loud dance music) The battle has started. (hosts screaming for votes) Thank you, dear Caterpillar! You are finally spending! (ka-ching ka-ching sound) He is insane! Caterpillar got us to No. 1. Yay! Let's take a look at Big Li. Stay confident and fight with me! [MC] The money plane is taking off! Thank you, Cutie Goddess! How much are you spending? I think Big Li is 80% likely to win. I like him because he's a nice guy. Between guys, it's easy to get excited by comaraderie. "Your life's been so tough. OK, I'll help you win." Pat it. Bashful, huh? Hosts actually don't need any talent to win. (Big Li laughes) You only need to solicit votes. If patrons support you, you'll be fine. This competition is a game of money. Money determines everything. (loud dance music playing) Shake those tits! Now take off your top! Who cares about rules or penalties! Come on! [MC] Our competitor is chasing us! Hurry with your votes!!! Whatever happens, let's charge forward! (sound of planes taking off) (ka-ching ka-ching) 9 million votes! That's $1.5 million! Where did he get all that money? It's $1.5 million! Dear God! Fuck you! Tell them to continue. I need to take care of something. It's very... very scary. None of Li's patrons thinks he still has a chance. They all have stopped spending. Picasso's side... used all their trump cards. They are part of an agency. They can use the agency's income to buy votes. Contestants of the same agency can also buy each other votes. Online agencies are... talent agencies for internet celebrities. Each of us has a big boss, who controls us. Agencies invest money to promote hosts. Once hosts attract fans and patrons to buy them gifts, agencies can then take a cut. If hosts want to win, they must have support from their fans, patrons and agencies. All three are necessary. (dark music playing) Many fans cried. When Picasso reached 9 million votes, a female fan was still spending $2 an hour on vote lottery for Big Li. She texted me, like - "I got another 1000 votes for Li." I didn't know how to reply. So I just typed "lol." As I was typing... my tears came down. What has Big Li done... to deserve his fans? They just want to see Big Li win. They've waited for three years. They often say - Chief, we and YY both owe you a No. 1. But I know that... those who crave this No. 1 to show off the most... are actually his fans. Because they have nothing else to show off. I stepped onto this stage with my dream. But now, my dream is shattered again. Brothers, I am so sorry. We'll have to wait another year! One more year! Stay with me one more year! His fans have been very supportive. But it's been three years. Will they continue to support him in the 4th year? He may be forgotten by this market, and swept away by other No. 1's on this platform. -The contest is over! -Let's check again. Big Li is No. 3. OH-MY-GOD! I'm really speechless! You should feel proud of me, and proud of yourself. Because... I didn't disappoint you. This No. 1... belongs to our entire showroom! I want to go to Guangzhou, to pick up that award. To the award ceremony! (crowd cheering) (energetic dance music playing) Next on the red carpet - Picasso and Wen'er! (fans cheering) Next let's welcome... YY General Manager, Mr. Chen Zhou. (song "Bang Bang" playing) Welcome Shen Man! (audience whistling and applauding) Next we'll present the annual... Best Host Award. The Best Host Award winner is... YY's No. 1 talk show host, Picasso! I'm Picasso. I didn't expect to win. First, I'd like to thank all my fan brothers. Next, my boss YY Fish. He alone changed the course of the battle, and enabled me, the underdog, to triumph in the end. YY Fish spent $1.8 million in total. YY Fish is rich. Otherwise how could he spend like that? Regardless, he made a smart move investing in this agency. Twelve wins. Exactly as they'd planned. YY Fish took 12 wins this year, among 20 categories in total. Thanks to the suppport of my boss YY Fish. Thanks to YY Fish for giving me this platform. Otherwise I'd remain a nobody. Thanks, my boss YY Fish. Thanks, all my patrons and all my fans for your support. (audience whistling and applauding) (gym music playing) Are you here for my class or just a walk? This first, then class. Just tell me the truth! I made a bet with Picasso this year. If I can lose 90 lbs by December, I win $160k. Three... two... Ok. Break. She was my personal trainer first. Then she started doing live streaming herself. She asked me about YY. I told her YY is very lucrative so she joined. Much more than what you make here. Forget about personal training. Are you live streaming? Or watching live streaming? Now is the era when everyone live streams. Now there are over 400 live streaming platforms. Live streaming users have reached 325 million. This 19-month-old girl live streamed eating a meal, and attracted 540k fans. Leveraging its huge user base, YY has developed a unique online showroom ecosystem based on agencies. Now it's undisputedly the leader in this industry. The biggest spenders on YY all run agencies now. We all started just for fun. But a businessman always thinks about business. After spending for a while, he figures - if others can make money off this, why can't I? Look at this hostess. Just today, a single patron spent $600 on her. Then promote her, but make her work harder. I bought an agency and got into this business. Agencies take 20% of hosts' income. We help hosts secure promotional spots on the platform. Agencies may also spend to buy them gifts. Why would that help make hosts popular? The simplest answer is that fans love to watch. Thanks, big brother. Thanks, Songge! My boss is rich! Hey you! Hey! Get up. It's almost 3pm. Get up. It's already 3pm. Pingshao is waiting for your call. -Long or short sleeves? -Long sleeves. Oh my god. What a pigsty! Wear this. Not that one. It's cold. Wear this, wear this. -It's warmer. -No. What are you mumbling about*** ♪ A shepherd's song travels ♪ ♪ across the grassland ♪ ♪ Leaving behind many ♪ ♪ beautiful legends ♪ ♪ Oh my darling... ♪ ♪ I'll love you ♪ ♪ Forever and ever ♪ Recently he ran away from home for 2 weeks. I was really angry, because before he left, he smashed our old car, and... trashed our computer. But there's no use being angry. Should I also threaten divorce... whenever I'm pissed? All I can do is to let him be. Now he often mentions... he's depressed. I worry about that. So I'm OK making any compromise. -What do you want? -Is dinner ready? Almost. Come set the table. Hurry. Hey! Drop it! You can't eat this any more. (toddler cries) Just let him cry. (Big Li yawns) A few YY hosts... shot to fame with the help from 1 or 2 big bosses. It's rumored that YY Fish... has spent $8 million on Picasso. Big bosses do enable you to rule the world. Now YY is more and more like real life. Money increasingly dictates everything on YY. Hosts no longer benefit much from having die-hard fans. Diaosi losers have no money to spend in real life. So they watch others spend online. Now diaosis no longer get excited watching others spend thousands at a time. They want to watch millions spent a night. (dark ambient music playing) I used to enjoy live streaming, because I truly loved this. I touched my fans and made them happy. When they were happy, I became their audience. I watched them laugh. And that laughter resonated with me. Alas, everything's changed. One day I had a whimsy idea to be a migrant worker again for a month. I want to go back to that life. Sleep in bunk beds. Together with friends and family from home. I want to... go back to that simple life. I switched jobs in September. Now I make $420 a month. Two days off each month. I don't know what I want to do. A friend referred me to this job in motor part supplies. I figure I already like motorcycles. (metal clanking) My relatives don't want me to always do migrant labor. They want me to find a job with a future, to make some money. (suspenseful music playing) Now Shen Man has become... the richest hostess on YY. Shen Man's last birthday party attracted almost 500k fans online. You guys accuse Shen Man of poaching others' patrons. But this is how the game is played on YY. I only wish I could do that! [MC] Shen Man, I heard someone will confess his love tonight. [MC] How do you feel about Shen Man? (crowd cheering) It's so exciting to watch. Yesterday Caterpillar bought her 5200 sets of gifts. To be honest, I'm exhausted. I bought this apartment for my father. Lately... my grandpa wants one too. So I wired $70k to my father this afternoon, to buy in our hometown. Renovation will cost another $90k. So I feel the burden is all on me. Nobody else makes money. The whole family depends on me. And nobody to talk to when I'm unhappy. There are hidden rules in this world too. Like those tuhao patrons. You think they are idiots, spending so much for nothing? They'll ask to meet you in person, or for something else. Lots are like that. Of course I'm resentful. Every girl wants to live like a princess. But when money is involved, family, love, friendship - they are all bullshit. All bullshit - People worship you if you are rich; Nobody gives a damn if you are poor. (cheerful music starts) Good evening, my buddies. The show is starting. (Shen Man sings) ♪ I didn't mean to argue with you ♪ ♪ So please don't be annoyed at me ♪ ♪ Again and again I smiled at the computer ♪ ♪ Reading our wonderful chat history ♪ ♪ Suddenly everything's changed ♪ ♪ Which is more than I can take ♪ Those trashing me are you tired yet? Take a water break, OK? In the beginning, when I worked with Shen Man, I nitpicked her constantly, and she adjusted accordingly. But now Shen Man and others don't mention me anymore. They all think YY Fish made them who they are. But for Big Li... he couldn't possibly sign with YY Fish. If he had signed with YY Fish last year, he would've died from depression. He values his freedom more. (action movie playing on TV) Have you lost it? You're fat because I spoiled you. You're lazy because I spoiled you. Now I've learned my lesson. Can you work harder? Can you? Speak louder. Watch it, cunt. Or I'll beat you up. Who are you calling cunt? Stupid cunt. (ominous music starts) I need to make some change. For three years I've failed to step on that award stage. People say I don't have anything to prove. But I still need... this No. 1... to prove myself, for that recognition. I don't have any other dreams. My only desire is to fulfill my current dream. And my current dream is all about YY. Thanks Young Dude for your gifts. Gee, I'm accused of being out of tune. Can't you be more lenient? Does anyone want a VIP vest? Just buy me 2628 gifts. Now an advertisement - if you want to buy high-quality phones like mine... This looks like an iPhone 6. You can't tell but it's fake. If you want to buy, just message zhz77779 on WeChat. OK, this concludes our show today. My babies, bye-bye. (phone ringing) Hello. [Patron] Do you miss me? Miss me or not? -Of course, I miss you. So why are you angry at me? Of course I'm pissed. You always visit the other showroom. Be thankful I'm not blocking you. It wasn't me. My staff was using my account for fun. I've told them - Stop courting girls in showrooms. You can find girls anywhere. Flash a thousand or two. Who wouldn't go home with you? Tsk. I wouldn't go home with you for $300k. You're different. But others... You think you're the prettiest of them all? Tsk. Quite the opposite. My looks are at most below average. Then why don't you sleep with me? I'd sleep with you for your money. But I already have plenty. Those hostesses starting out, desperate for fans, if I spend a little money on them, who wouldn't go home with me? Have I slept with any? You are overthinking this. I'm not overthinking. I'm just really insecure. Get it? You were played before, weren't you? Yes. Go ahead and laugh your head off. (talking continues on phone) I live with her. So I'm not worried. Not at all. They just talk over the phone. That's no big deal. Not a big deal at all. Why are you going to Sanya again for vacation? Why do you enjoy spending money again and again? I'm stressed out. Get it? Your vacation budget... divide it by the number of people going. How much would I get? Haven't you got enough cash gifts today? Not really. Just from you and Caterpillar. When I think about it, I feel disconnected from society. I don't go out, or even see the sun. No interest in anything. All I know is how to make money. I've told her - at most, she has two years left on YY. She's turning 22 soon. Back in real life, how can she continue to ensure the survival of this family? That's the urgent question for her to figure out. (cheesy pop song starts) If you ask me whether my family is rich or powerful, I'll tell you no matter what, I am a cutie pie. YY has allowed us, those with no social status, to make a living. Some hosts can only make $500-800 a month in real life. They can't even live off that. But hosts are all swindlers. Some swindle your money. Some are after your affection. Some simply want companionship. I hope we all remain oblivious, together living in these lies forever. I dedicate the next song to anyone... lacking the talent of deceit. I'm very happy... to welcome this grand moment - the opening of Agency Lanyu. Thanks Fa Ge, for giving us a home we are proud of. Next, let's warmly welcome Lanyu's big boss - Fa Ge! Let me briefly introduce myself. My YY handle is Kill Time. But you can call me Fa Ge. I'm honored to meet everyone here. I'd like to build Lanyu into... a big and famous agency on YY. Here's to wishing Agency Lanyu the best of luck! I wish Lanyu a grand future under Fa Ge's leadership. Through thick and thin, let's achieve glory together! I have known Big Li for many years. I'm really glad that he's found a good big brother, Fa Ge. Go, my Lanyu brothers! Once again, best of luck! Fa Ge and I used to be the same - big patrons. Why doesn't he show his face? He doesn't want others to... find out his real identity. (party chatter) I'm one of Big Li's VIP fans. I wish Big Li great success this year. You fucking better get on that red carpet. Long live Big Li's fan club! You all traveled from all over China... to gather in Xiamen for our 3rd annual fan meetup. Thanks to our big boss, Fa Ge, for sponsoring this trip. I've heard... the same wish from all of you, that I get a better result in this year's competition. I also have high hopes myself. I will do everything I can. OK? YEAH!!! No matter who's hot on the internet, on YY we only care for Big Li! Bottoms up! (crowd cheering) I've never stayed at such a nice hotel before. Over a thousand fans wanted to come. Only a few had the luck of the draw. When I first met Big Li, I was too excited to speak. -Same here! I couldn't speak either. Other than Big Li, when I watch other hosts... regardless of gender, looks, or how well they sing, I have no feelings for them. None at all. I only have feelings for Big Li... - Let's shake hands first. I only have feelings for Big Li! Now, under Fa Ge's leadership, I feel he's under much less stress. His shows have improved. -Sometimes it feels like following a hot TV show. You can't wait to watch the next episode. -Yes yes yes! -You want him to keep on going, keep bringing us joy. My name is Bruce Lee. Oh, your name is what? (dynamic music playing) (canned laughter) Let me turn off the slimming effect. Oh no, this sucks. All of you big shots on YY, let me pay you respect first as the head of Li's army. (canned laughter) When will you finish your drink? This is already my third. -Talking about me? -Yes! We hardly drink together. This is probably our first time. Listen - get some work done on your nose, chin, cheeks and eyes. I'm serious! It's not like I'll face you for the rest of my life. Why not? Even you and Big Li may divorce. But we'll always be together. -You had your nose done? -Yes. Made it higher. -Eyes? -Yes. -Chin? -Yes. -Forehead? -Nope. -Temples? -Yes. Holy crap. Excuse me. -How much more do I owe? -Please pay an additional... Should be enough. Keep the change. Thanks. Of everyone I've dated, who do you think is handsome? -Patron Weiyi. -He's handsome? Very handsome. Yuck. Yuck. Then why the hell did you fall head over heels for him? When someone is in love... -You still haven't learned your lesson. -Yes, I have. I won't get fooled again. [Dabao] You don't realize it but now you're often walking a tightrope. Like with patrons Caterpillar and Shengdi. When you were with that guy, you also said - Sister, don't worry, I know when to stop. In the end... [Shen Man] Let me tell you something. -See. See. -I don't want to be a sinner. Causing divorce again? Deja vu all over again. -I won't let it happen. I'll stop him. As an online host, you shouldn't have gotten yourself... into the situation where you have to reject patrons, because your livelihood depends on their affection. But you've never followed the rule. The rule is simple for girls - Keep online and offline separate. You still don't get it. (dark music starts) (crowd whispering) **People call Shen Man "300 Man." Imagine what her reputation is like. Folks, let me tell you about this "300 Man." People say it costs only 300 yuan ($50) to sleep with her. Even if she paid me 300, I wouldn't sleep with her. But some have already spent millions. And even that may not be enough. Or really - you know all about my affairs? How about the one with your father? We even had a kid together. I didn't tell you, because you couldn't handle it. YY hostesses are said to be like those in nightclubs. Ever been to a nightclub? With money, you can do anything. Otherwise you can only gawk. (canned laughter) Should I be ashamed? How about you? Self-righteous douchebags. You guys hole up on the internet, one hand picking your nose, one foot on the table. "Fuck, Shen Man, you 300 bitch!" Don't you think I know? Sons of bitches. Let me sing you a song. She has 4.92 million fans. If everyone gossiped, the spittle alone would drown her. It's true - I'll sleep with you for 300 yuan. I'm a whore, a worn-out pussy. Happy now? Once your reputation is gone, how can you continue on YY? She's obviously not as popular as before. Time to get up, chief. It's 3:30pm. You'll be late. Get up, chief. You'll have to get up anyway. Why drag your feet? (Big Li grunts) (Dabao typing swiftly) Tell her to compete for Best Hostess. Isn't that too competitive? As long as she can make money. Don't overthink this. She's... got no chance to win. Hello, Chief Shang. Big Li and I? We are OK. He went back to his hometown, because we had a fight. Now we just leave it hanging. No contact. We are both busy. OK, thank you so much. OK, bye-bye. So awkward - everyone asks if we'll get back together. This marriage business... I don't want to go back. Tired and fed up. Life here in Hebei is pretty good. It feels like home. We've been together for over 3 years. Over 3 years. Looking back, we've never been a good match. He's always wanted a... good wife and doting mother. But I... I've never been willing to stay home as a housewife. So most of the time we can't communicate. When we do talk, we argue, and end up talking about divorce. (dance music starts) I'm back, brothers. I'll get on the road in 5-6 days. I have to visit all my big patrons. Patron Tiange asked me to visit Nanjing. If I can get him drunk, he'll spend $70k in the competition. Brother Bear, you ejaculated again? So many dots in your chat. Brother Bear! I'll be slutty if you want me to. Brother Bear! (Yong laughs heartedly) I worked in a restaurant over the summer. Chopping chickens everyday. They paid only $200 a month. My old boss called and said she needed help. So I came back to the old job. Thank you patron Qige! Not bad - I've already earned $5k. I don't know what other job to do. I... don't get to choose. I don't want to go back to factories. Talented or not, one has to be shameless. Otherwise how can one survive on YY? His life is probably tough too. Hustling every day. Must be tough too. Let's be honest - during last year's competition, didn't I have the best momentum? But I still lost in the end. People will forever remember you as the loser. Nobody recalls how awesome you were in the process. This is reality. This is YY. This is our society. We can only accept it. (music continues) In order to attract eyeballs, live streaming shows are going to extremes. An online hostess... had group sex with two men and a woman in a rental property. And she live streamed the whole thing. The suspect confessed that he stole... in order to become an online celebrity. He live streamed his burglary... to attract fans and get famous. A Taiwanese hostess live streamed in tears. She swallowed more than 20 sleeping pills, and also slit her wrist. Even after she was sent to the hospital, she live streamed her treatment process. Now every agency wants to IPO. To IPO, you need the help of venture capital. Venture capital invests in you in exchange for shares. Why is this year's competition rumored to be super exciting? Because venture capital is spending money. This year's competition is crazy. Every agency is working to... get their hosts into the annual competition. Who doesn't want to win? She won last year, so this year she's the most promoted host on YY. Without a No. 1, look at... all the new faces on YY now. They can easily replace her. Does my dress look OK today? Maybe I should wear a hat. Does this look better? You think seeing my shoulders is a special treat? I'll let you see my breasts after the competition, OK? (music continues) Li's fans have lost for three years. The 4th year - it should be our turn to win. You're committed to help me win, right? Brother Wong, tell no one about our deal. No one. Let me hand the phone to him, chief. Where are you? It's Fa Ge. Let me know your final decision. We don't want to screw up our plan tonight. Last year Picasso and Shen Man won Best Host awards. Can they and other winners from last year... successfully defend their titles? The question remains - brothers, who will you support? Here comes the fish. I miss daddy. -Where is your daddy? -In Guangzhou. Having meetings. -Where is he having meetings? -In a big bright room. -What meeting? -A computer meeting. Tasty? I guess there's still hope for us. Maybe I gave him too much pressure. I want him to... handle his work well. I also want him to be... a good husband, a good father. It's impossible - he's only 25! (dramatic music starts) This year's highlight is Picasso battling Big Li. They are the marquee hosts of Lanyu and Yujia. Agency Yujia is very successful. It's studying how to IPO... Lanyu is a new agency with deep pockets. Agency Yujia's boss is called YY Fish. His identity is a mystery. He doesn't even live in China. Fa Ge is a loan shark from Big Li's hometown. Fa Ge has promised to spend... $5 million. Fa Ge is awesome. The money he has! Agencies spend to spur consumption. Once an agency supports you, patrons consider you more likely to win. So they support you too. It's hard to predict who will win. It all depends on Fa Ge's wealth. Now the battle is between the agencies. Since I started competing in the annual competition, it's been four years. I've lost three times. This year I have the best chance to win. I don't know if this will be my last time. This is not only for you, my brothers, but also for Lanyu, and myself. I want to go all out for once. As long as I can feed myself, I'm willing to risk everything. (metal clanking) (light turned on) (digital sound of logging in) I've waited so long for today. Fight! 140k fans... wow 150k now! My god! Brothers, let's get to 1 million votes! We are at 980k now. We are barely behind them! (canned laughter) Thank you, Yong. Fuck yeah! It's been only an hour. Big Li has almost 2 million votes. [Shen Man] Don't you mock me yet. "Go find your hubby for help"? Brother, it's still too early. Don't you underestimate me. I'm scared of her 700k votes? Tell her without 10 million, she has no fucking chance! (crowd cheering) (airplane takes off) (airplane takes off) Thank you brothers for your gifts. Live in the moment! Let's all go crazy! [MC] Fa Ge just arrived. Thank you Fa Ge! [Picasso MC] Brothers! Don't stop buying votes! YY Fish is fighting alone! (MC screaming for votes) YY has gone crazy! Hurry or you'll miss it! Fuck, all that money. If only it were mine. (crew chatting) Lower it like this? Should I bare a shoulder? Hi, Shen Man. I am a reporter from Hunan TV. From a nobody to... someone on top of the live streaming world. Do you consider yourself a star? -I don't feel that way. I'm just an average person who got lucky. I grew up poor. Sometimes we couldn't even afford rice or vegetables. I remember right after my dad's bankruptcy, I only had $50k in the bank. I spent over $35k and bought him a car. When I sat in his car, I'd remember when I was a child... I remember... back in Zhongshan... Stop filming. Yes, because... Because... my dad always adored me. I remember being so happy in his car... when I was a child. Even though my mother... My mother and I are not in touch. But still... So now you are working so hard... because you feel obligated to support the entire family? Yes. My sister is about to go to college. I'll probably have to support her too. But I feel this is what I should do. Are you happy? In what sense? Overall. I'm happy. Compared to many others, I think I should be happy. (slow suspenseful music) I think this time... Big Li should win. He should win. Because he's gone insane. I've set aside $400k of my own cash to buy votes. Plus all my earnings will be spent on votes too. So I'll spend about $850k. I'm waiting for Fa Ge's instruction. Be patient. I'm also waiting. I'm also waiting. (phone ringing) Yes, Fa Ge. Wait - do we fight back tonight? Not tonight. So you're OK with him leading by 8 million votes, even though you have enough to buy 20 million*** Why is this battle so exhausting*** Today we have to... get back to the top. Otherwise we lose the momentum. Let's fight for Agency Lanyu and Fa Ge! Fight for Lanyu and Fa Ge! Fa Ge keeps asking me how much my patrons have prepared. Just now? He's been like this lately. People may think we're scamming my patrons. Yes, Fa Ge? Are you going to spend tonight? Huh! Haha! How can I pretend everything's still OK? In 10 minutes, YY Fish spent $600k on Picasso. And he's still spending. What? Wenjing is No. 1 now? Let her surge ahead. There's still plenty of time. 3 million... 3.9 million votes... Wow, 6 million! She's at 9 million now. (celebratory music playing) Thanks to all the Kings!!! (phone ringing) -Hello -[Patron] What just happened? I think we should... give up now. -How many votes does she have? -Ten million. We underestimated Wenjing. Her big boss Zhao Benshan has too powerful a network. It's impossible to beat them. Let's see what your boss decides. This bizarre YY... (heavy melancholy music) (music ceases abruptly) Fa Ge ran out of money. Once your boss stops spending, no patron wants to continue. What did Patron Wong say? He can spend another $600k. Not nearly enough! But what can I do now? [Patron] Big Li, you are such an idiot! I'm so mad. Obviously, Fa Ge didn't spend $5 million on you. He didn't! Where the hell is his money? He didn't even spend much. I had planned to spend more, but I stopped myself. I'm so fucking pissed. Don't talk big if you don't have the money. Can't believe he did this. He tricked you and scammed everyone. Or everyone will say Big Li and Fa Ge scammed us together. (eerie music playing) Fa Ge is a... smart businessman after all. Many consider him a scammer. But I think... in real business... there's no ethics to speak of. Hosts are trapped by the promise of fame from this annual competition. YY is different now. If you want fame, don't expect to make any money. You'll lose money if you want to win. The better your ranking is, the more your agency has to spend, the more you have to pay back. So you'll lose money. This competition has succeeded in milking everyone's money. It's carefully designed so nobody can afford to lose. But what can we do? We all play within the rules of this game. If the game designer ever changes a rule, a winner could immediately become a sucker. A slew of high-growth Chinese Internet companies have quarterly earnings coming up. YY, one of China’s online social platforms, is set to report earnings after the close on Tuesday. Analysts project earnings to jump 60%. YY’s share has risen 53% this year. YY shares revenue with its hosts. YY takes almost 60%, while hosts and their agencies share the other 30-40%. That's why YY is a very sticky and profitable business. (digital glitch sound) I don't think this virtual world is... that much different from real life. Only that this platform helps release... some energy that is otherwise suppressed in real life. We have 105 million active users on YY. One million hosts are on our platform. Most of them live in the virtual world. They may lack friends in real life. So this platform allows them to more truthfully express themselves. (soft eerie music continues) I'm not lonely. I can watch Big Li on my computer everyday. It's very exciting to watch. It makes you wonder too - Why is it so easy for others to make money, and so difficult for me? I don't have any dream. No dreams. I feel completely isolated from the world. Everyday other than watching Shen Man's shows, there's only work. But her showroom has too many people. She won't notice any simple chat. If you want to interact with her, buying her gifts is the only way. Look - Shen Man's die-hard fans are still waiting in her room. It's meaningless for her to continue. If she didn't drop out of the competition, both her patrons and her agency would hemorrhage money. And she would make no money in the end. It's totally pointless. Look at the battle between Big Li and Picasso. Picasso will end up losing $650k of his own money. Big Li will lose almost $1 million. So both have already lost. Only the platform is the winner. Two fucking losers. (soft music starts) Anyhow... I may need some time to recover. Then... when I have courage to come back and face you all... Maybe a week. Maybe three days. Maybe six months. Maybe a year. Or maybe I'll never return. Wait for me? What if I never come back? No, I didn't do my makeup. What if you'll stop loving me after one look? Just a glimpse? (music stops) (mouse click) (mouse click) Beautiful, huh? Told you that you'd fall in love after just one look. Thank you all for being here. It makes this virtual world feel less fake. OK, I'll shut up now. But if you want to buy me gifts, buy expensive ones like diamond rings. (Shen Man giggles) Good night. (mouse click) However you'd like to vent, take it out all on me. I didn't scam anyone for money. That's the truth. I'm sorry, everyone. (Big Li breathes heavily) Let me play a song. Which song though? (energetic music starts) I'll never compete again. I only bring you disappointment. Only disappointment. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. (Big Li cries harder) I miss my son. I miss my son. My life actually sucks. For four years, YY has been my everything.
