[laughs] It's so good to finally see you in person. Oh, my God, you're so beautiful. [gasps] Oh, my God. Oh, I'm sorry. Is this okay? You must be tired. Here, let me take this. How was your trip? It was okay. How you feeling? -I'm okay. -Are you tired? Oh, you must be hungry. I know you know we got the best bagels. Pizzas, too. But not all pizzas are equal. Just because you're in New York don't mean that you can get pizza anywhere. Those days are over. Here. I just had one. They're delicious. I put more apple in yours so it's sweeter. I bought some basics, but we can go to the supermarket and pick up whatever you really like. I usually keep my refrigerator empty. What do you normally listen to? -[car engine starts] -Hmm? [Latin music on radio] I got you this pillow. My girlfriend swears by it. It supports your back-- Oh! You wanna get a foot massage? Oh, my God. Let's get foot massages. You like foot massages? Do you have any new partners since we last spoke? [woman] No. And you're still with... Yeah. In November, we treated you for chlamydia. In March, we treated you for gonorrhea. And you've been with the one partner this whole time? Now... math was never my strong suit, but it seems like there's a pattern here. If he's gonna step out on you, the least he could do is use protection. -Sometimes he do. -Sometimes ain't enough. He's exposing you. You deserve better than that. But the good news is, you're using long-term birth control. You've taken control of your fertility, and that's awesome. Mmm? Hmm? Hmm? Mm-hmm. So if you get pregnant, it ain't gonna be "Oh, shit." It's gonna be "Hell yeah." Am I right? But we still got this elephant in the room that keeps giving you venereal diseases. Yes, I called your man an elephant. [chuckles] All right, now, you know the drill. We're gonna collect urine and give you an HIV test. -[drink bubbling] -[humming] [inhales] [blowing, vocalizing] Keep the bubbles to a steady roll. Not too big, not too small. [blowing, humming] Like this? [blowing, vocalizing] Make sure the onset of the E is synchronous with, it goes with the blow. So it's-- it's not... [vocalizes, blows] Or... [blows, vocalizes] But... [blowing, humming] [blowing, vocalizing] That's it. That's it, that's it. Soft palate open. Excuse me just one minute. Where the fuck have you been? -Out. -Out. For two days? I thought you might be dead. [sighs] I texted you that I was staying out. [woman] What happened to calling? Give me my car keys. -[sighs] -Now! -My phone died. -Your phone died. On what day, and in what country are there no chargers? There's a charger in the fucking car! Sorry about that. Kids, you know? [woman] Here we are! Let me show you the best part. I'm on the list for a two-bedroom, but for now I've set it up for the baby. Come on, let me show you. And this is you. Here's the linens. Backup toiletries are over here. And if you close the blinds, it gets really dark in here. I don't know about you, but I am really sensitive to light, so I like to keep my bedroom like a cave. Is there anything you wanna ask me? What's the Wi-Fi? This heifer shows up 20 minutes late, can see the lobby is packed full of patients whose vitals I did a half hour ago, and proceeds to sit in her office and eat her stinky salad for a diet that clearly is not working. -You need to stop. -Mmm! And while she's eating said stinky salad, making everybody wait, she proceeds to show me pictures for the hundredth time. Don't nobody wanna see your fucking wedding pictures from your fucking wedding in Tulum. -Hey, Ida. -[laughs awkwardly] Dr. Caffrey! Good afternoon, Doctor. I just got the pictures back. -I was just telling Ida how gorgeous they were. -Let me see! [gasps] -They are beautiful! -Mmm. Oh! Sorry I couldn't make it. You were missed. Are we running low on rapid tests? I noticed that. Huh. Have Edwin order some more. -Will do. -Aww! Enjoy your lunch. -She invited you? -Have you been in my fridge? -Why didn't you go? -I don't do weddings. You can't be taking my supplies. There are people who don't feel comfortable coming in here for our services. -I'm aware. -So I take our services to them. Like we used to when we had a mobile clinic. It's not like I'm selling them. We shouldn't be having this conversation. You need to stop. [Ida sighs] [low, ominous music] [♪] Constance? -[Connie] What? -Don't play with me, Constance. Open the goddamn door. Show me your transcript. -What? -Now. [scoffs] I don't have it. Pull it up on your computer. That's not how it works. We had a deal. Do I need to piss test you? I don't know. Does weed show up? 'Cause it's legal now. What about Molly? I'm not going through this with you again. I'm fine. [woman] Where were you? -Working. -Yeah, working? Yeah, where? More modeling? Are you moving up in the world? This is why I don't tell you shit. In 36 hours, you post nonstop pictures of your ass in dental floss, -but you can't call me back? -Are you body shaming me? Keep on doing what you're doing, Einstein. You're gonna end up wrapped in a rug in the middle of a fucking meridian on a thruway, and nobody's gonna give a shit about you except for me. You should get that in a greeting card. Yeah. How lucrative is it selling your ass these days? -Better than it was in yours! -I never. The only reason why anyone ever let you sing was because you were half-naked. -I had talent. -Please! You were selling your ass and tits, too. -Not the same. -I've seen the videos. ♪ I got my eye on you Ooh, ooh ♪ That's some real talent right there. Do you really need these men's validation? Do you?

The Truth About Men Will Set You Free. -You're being cruel. -Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. It must really bother you that men don't even look at you anymore. -This isn't about me. -You might wanna ask yourself why you're still alone instead of wasting your life tormenting me. You are fucking pathetic. Hello? Pero yo no te-- Oh, okay. -Go ahead-- What? -[woman on phone] I was just gonna call you. -[Ida] Hey, mama. -[shower running] This is getting so real! -I know! -[man] How's the girl? Not the most talkative. I'm sure you talked enough for the both of you. -Fuck off. -[man] I gotta run. I have a date with an anesthesiologist from Beth Israel. -Who? -Yeah, who? You don't know him! You worried about things missing from your fridge? Phew! You should see the party favors these guys walk off with. -No party favors. -[man] Okay! See you soon. -Can't wait. -You're scaring me. Bye! Love you. Mean it. Sorry. Remind me again. This is the Craigslist girl? -Her name's Nina. -Nina, yeah. Do you have anything in writing? Anything legally binding? -Not yet. -Okay. Do you know anything about her? I got about two good eggs left in me, and I'm single, so. Okay, understood. Um... [clears throat] ...have you heard from Desmond? Desmond? Why are you bringing him up? Nothing, I-- Just thinking about him. -Why would you do that? -He's our brother? Don't be inviting him to my party. Hold on. Serene's on the other line. Should we FaceTime? No, I gotta go. Tell her I can't wait to see her, and not to forget to bring my niece. Bye. Hey. -[Serene] I hit her. -Hit who? I've never-- I mean, I-- I spanked her as a kid, but... [Ida] Okay, just breathe. I've lost it. I fucking lost it. [Ida] It's okay. You're human. You'll-- you'll repair the damage. I got her favorite dumplings. -That's a start! -I'm afraid.

That she's driving herself off a cliff. -At least she's driving. -What? If there's one thing I've learned about your sister, it's don't try to learn too much about your sister. -[scoffs] Stupid. -She threw a drink in my face. -Well, you deserved it. -On Christmas! -It was a long time ago. -Never forget.

Seriously, bro, you think storm clouds, you're gonna get storm clouds. -Why are you so tense? -I don't know, bro. Maybe it's 'cause I'm here 60 hours a week with a baby at home. All right, well, I'm gonna send you this 21-day meditation I just did with Alicia Keys. -Sure, 'cause that'll help. -Yeah, send it to me, too. Check it out. So last night I was covering a shift at the hotel, and who should be a guest? Bertha González Nieves. You don't know who she is? Come on, man. She's the first woman to be certified Maestra Tequilera. Casa Dragones? Nina, you're young, you're hip. -You know about Casa Dragones? -Uh, tequila. See what I'm saying? It's that hip downtown crowd. It's a whole new clientele we gonna get in here. Anyway, me and Bertha, we was vibing, and, you know, she was like, "I'ma gift you three cases of this." Gonna do a whole thing here. I'm gonna go back and get the rest. Nice to meet you. Jellyfish. -Gabe is our superstar mixologist. -He's a bartender. And I thought he wasn't working at the hotel anymore. -What's up with that? -That was my understanding. -Sorry. -Stop apologizing. Sorry. Um, this guy wants to speak with the owner. -About what? -[Lindsay] He says he didn't like his steak last night. He says he's gonna leave us one star on Yelp if we don't credit his account.

[Ida] You know I'm not, but... you look jaundiced. Yeah, the lighting in here is terrible. [Ida] Are you on any medication? You know, we so over-medicated as a culture. Did you stop by my clinic today? You're not gonna believe what I found the other day. Look at this. People would kill for this, huh? Look how dense this is. Huh? You could make a lot of good stuff with this wood. People make furniture with this wood. Sturdy. Lasts forever. What are you doing here? You have family. You have sisters. -You have a daughter. -She can't see me like this. -I want a doctor to look at you. -I'm good right here. [Ida] You wanna pack a bag, or do you need me to? [sighs] Come on, sis.

I know I haven't been the best mother-- That's not true. You've been a great mother. I should've forced her and Des to have a relationship. -I loved your brother. -[Ida] I know. But to see little Connie all dressed up, ready for her big day with Daddy, sitting by the door, hair all pretty, three o'clock, four o'clock, midnight. How many times do you do that to a child? Never. I think I told you about her secret Instagram? -It's not that secret. -[Ida] Daisy. What? It isn't. [Serene] She's right. She doesn't respect her body. I don't even recognize her. That face? So much makeup. It's covering up her light. I know she's been putting you through a lot. By wearing makeup? I'm sorry.

Good evening. I'm Dr. Zeller. Hello, I'm Ida, his sister. This is my sister-in-law Serene. Mr. Salcedo. How are you feeling tonight? I have the results of your diagnostic tests. Uh, do you wanna have this conversation with me alone? They can stay. Well, I wish I had better news. Your liver is failing. That's why you're retaining all that fluid in your belly. We can control, with medication, some of the symptoms. There's a slight chance we could investigate a liver transplant, -but we'd have to find a match very soon. -I'll be the donor. Well, that's very generous of you. -We can do some tests-- -I'm not interested. Okay, what are the other options? How about dialysis? Unfortunately, dialysis doesn't work for liver failure. [Ida] What does that mean? It means a transplant is his only option. -I can get tested tonight. -I said I'm not interested. You won't have to wait on a list. I understand this is a lot to process, and you have a big decision to make. Why don't I give you a little time, and I'll come back later. Thank you, Doctor. [Serene] I-- I have to find Connie. [Daisy] The last time I saw my brother, we were both on the same flight to Miami. My seat was past his, so I said, hey... an olive branch, you know? He looked straight into my eyes and turned around, like I didn't exist. Even after that, I called him more than once on his birthday and... never heard from him. But, if he wants to turn me into the scapegoat for the shitty life he created and take zero responsibility for any of it, what am I supposed to do? I never, uh... knew my birth parents. I met my aunt once. Or, like, my bio mom's cousin. She worked at The Gap. And let me use her discount. Did you get great stuff? Just, like, one of those thin hoodies with a zipper. But my foster brother stole it. Where he at? Should we go find him and get it back? [chuckles] No, it meant more to him to have nice things. What you're doing is very brave. You know that, right? This baby's never gonna not know how loved she is. You hear that, baby? You are love. You're enough. You are safe. I gotta tell you something. I don't know who the father is. It's okay. [vacuum whirring] [♪] [♪] [hoarsely] I thought maybe you could call her. [heart monitor beeping] Why are you talking like that? I-- I don't know. Maybe something in the air. Yeah. That would be me. [chuckles] You really don't know where she could be at? She hasn't answered my calls or called me back. I'm sure she's fine. The last few years have been... hell. I-- I can't do anything right. She fucking hates me. [Desmond] You know, I don't believe that. Connie-- Connie needs to know you. Excuse me. We're just gonna be closing the doors. [Serene] Okay. [melancholy music] [♪] You missed me? [Ida] You didn't fill your prescription. -You missed me! -Why you didn't pick up your meds? I think I forgot that paper you gave me. [Ida] It's waiting for you at the pharmacy. All you gotta do is say your name. Wait, really? When was the last time you had sex? Dang, miss! Like, you're just gonna jump right into it? Like, no foreplay? No-- no lube? Did you have sex today? [laughs] What kind of girl do you take me for? Sorry. I didn't know you were with someone. So sorry. They have me on camera. [Ida] What? Where? Outside. A hallway. [sighs] I don't know. This is gonna be on my permanent record. You knew how vindictive NYU is. My people take things from offices all the time. I can't lose my fucking insurance, Ida. Not right now. [Ida] You won't. How do you know? 'Cause. We're not gonna let that happen. [knocking at door] [knocking continues] -Yes? -[Caffrey] Dr. Caffrey. [Ida] Morning, Doctor. You need to clean out your desk. It's just a lot. Hey, can't you call out sick, huh? Your brother's in the hospital. I tried. We're short a nurse. I can't believe they fired Clint. -[sighs] -[Ray] Well... he did it to himself. I found out he's in therapy three days a week. Not surprising. The guy's clearly troubled. Why would you say that? He's in therapy three days a week. Well, I just told you that. He could keep his insurance if he marries somebody in network. Yeah? Well, who's he gonna marry? I could marry him. What? You would marry this guy? For insurance. [Ray] I don't even know what you're talking about. I'm talking about helping a dear friend in a desperate situation. First of all, it is legal for men to get married nowadays, so. So he could keep his insurance so he can take care of himself. I don't even understand you. Now, of all times. What choice do I have? Why does it always gotta be you rescuing everybody? Maybe finding my brother overdosed in the bathroom when I was 17 might have something to do with it. I don't know. The voices are expensive, believe me. I know, you've mentioned it. [Ray] And people aren't always what you think. When I was working nights, there was this guy, Darryl. He was... Anyways, he made me coffee one night, and I started feeling sleepy. Now, what kind of coffee makes you feel sleepy? What-- what are you saying? I'm saying the guy made me coffee and it did the exact opposite of what coffee should do. Okay, but why are you telling me this? Because! People aren't always what you think. Was Darryl gay? Oh, this is fucking priceless. [Ray sighs] I-- [monitors beeping] [clears throat] [inhales, exhales deeply] [♪] [Connie on recording] Hey, it's Connie. Um... yeah. [automated voice] The mailbox is full and cannot accept any messages at this time. Goodbye. [♪] [gagging] [grunts] [gags, spits] [hospital din] [sighs] Excuse me. Um... can you please tell me what room Desmond Salcedo's in? [nurse] Oh, I'm sorry. The patient requested no visitors tonight. Those are for him. ♪ Bitter Friday ♪ ♪ And I cooled it down today ♪ -Why didn't you text me? -I did. Who was she with? Some guy. They, uh, they ordered a big brunch, and they said you would cover it. When was this? Earlier. How old was he? I don't know, around her age. I wouldn't worry about it. We need to figure out this Gabe situation. What now? I'm doing my job and half of his. We could've just hired a bar manager. You're right. We could've, but we didn't. -Well, he's your friend. -Oh no, don't put this on me. You're a grown man. I didn't browbeat you with it. I'm ready to let him go. He's sweat equity, and he's not sweatin'. Okay. That's how you feel. Why don't we figure out a time to talk to him first? I spoke to Ben. He said cut our losses. -Cut our losses? What are you talking about? -Yeah. Gabe is more than just a-- a bartender. He's a partner. Plus, are you forgetting that I am going on maternity leave soon? All right, fine. I'll have another conversation with him. -Does that make you happy? -Thank you. [door creaks] [sighs heavily] [locks click] Nina? You going somewhere? Uh, no. I just got home. I heard you came by the restaurant today. Next time... can you just let me know? [Nina] Sorry about that. It's okay. So, who were you with? I know your friend was drinking. Were you drinking, too? Okay, so, who were you with? Um, a friend saw from the 'Gram that I was in New York, so he reached out. Um, I didn't know where else to take him. Sorry. I'm not mad. -Daisy? -Yeah. Um... so I was thinking-- Or I wanted to, um, ask. [Daisy] What? What if we, like, you and me, raise the baby? Together? Yeah, like, you could be the mom, but, um, or-- Yeah, I don't really know how that would look. [toilet flushes] Is your friend in there? [knocking forcefully] -Hello? -[Nina] I'll take care of it. Hey. [Daisy] Who are you? What's going on? I apologize if my presence here is uninvited. My name's Gunner. No worries. What are you doing here? I'm picking up Nina. That's my baby. So I came to get her. Like, no disrespect, not hostile, but I'm taking my baby. Nina? Were you really gonna leave without telling me anything? If you bought things, if this was any financial hardship on your part, then I will send money when I get paid to cover the costs. I'm currently owed money by a number of individuals, so once that comes through, I'll be more than happy-- Yeah, no, I need to talk to Nina alone. Can you wait outside for a sec? Baby, should I start bringing the bags-- Yeah, let's hold off on that. [sighs] I'll be outside. [door creaks] [door slams shut] What's going on? I never meant to mislead you. -Did you? -No, I-- Are you really doing this? Is this his idea or yours? I mean, where will you go? He has friends in Hartford. Will they take care of this child? They have a spare room. I'm open to raising this baby together. -You are? -Yeah. You'll have visitation rights. She'll know you're the biological mother. I want you in the baby's life. Yeah, I don't know. You don't have to make this decision today. [Nina] He came all the way down to New York. And we can tell him to come back when you know what you really want. Can he stay here? [sighs] I don't think that's such a good idea. I don't think he'll go without me. I'll talk to him. Okay? Yeah, uh, so, Nina's not going anywhere right now. -You don't get to say that. -She said that. Nina. I'll do whatever you want. Yeah, I already told you what she wanted. No, listen, Miss, my father wasn't in the picture for me, and I won't ever do that. That's my baby. -You sure about that? -Don't! -What? -Tell him. The fuck is she talking about? Nina. I was gonna tell you. -Wait, what? -[Nina] I'm sorry. It's not mine? -Maybe. -Maybe? -What the fuck, Nina? -Okay! You-- We all need to calm down. -When we took a break-- -Yeah, I wasn't with nobody! -I told you I wasn't! -I know what you said. You didn't think to say somethin'? -You never asked! -Okay! Let's not do anything that we're all gonna regret. Okay? [Nina] I'm sorry, Jude. Okay, there's a lot goin' on. Okay. I mean, you was within your right. We was on break. Was it Kev? Actually, I'd rather not know. Yeah, let's just all take some time. I don't need no time. Look, Nina, I messed up when I let you go. And I'm not making that mistake twice. I don't give a fuck about any of that. I just want us to be a family. [sighs] [Daisy] You don't wanna do this. Trust me, you don't wanna do this. Nina, you can't do this. How could you do this to me? -It's a done deal. -Don't touch me! -Chill the fuck out! -Nina. I'm gonna call the police. Lady, that is not your fucking baby! -Move! -Nina. Nina. Nina. Nina! Nina! [sobs] Nina! [sobs] Nina! [sobbing hysterically] Ni-- [sobbing hysterically] [somber music] [birds chirp] [sniffles] Thank you for coming at the last minute. No worries. I got you. [chuckles] [sighs] I have about 12 students. What do you have 'em working on? Breath and scales. And what's going on with your breath? Sounds like you need a little scaling. I know. -How'd you lose your voice? -I don't know. Let me see. Is it red? It looks normal. You been getting enough sleep? I think so. Did you scream at somebody? -Not that I know of. -Hmm. Who hurt you? Tell me. [sighs] ♪ Qué pasa ♪ ♪ Qué pasa contigo ♪ You better tell me. ♪ Qué pasa contigo ♪ -♪ Mi hermana ♪ -[phone buzzing] ♪ Qué pasa contigo ♪ [singing in Spanish] Constance? Are you okay? ♪ Qué pasa ♪ Well, I've been trying to reach you. Well-- Wait. Where are you? [somber music] -Mama. -Hey. Hi. Ah! Oh, shit. How are two of my favorite people doin' today? Hey, how about that Casa Dragones? Was I right or what? That shit is a game-changer. -Yeah. We need to talk. -I know, I know, I know, I know. It's about my lateness. I'm working on it. Yeah, no, but this-- This isn't working. -What-- What's not working, Tim? -This partnership. Tim feels like the agreement we made about the division of labor is falling short. Yeah, yeah, like, we discussed this a thousand times, Gabe. Um, and we just had a-- I had a conversation with this um-- You're fired. -What? -Really? I'm sorry. Yes, you're fired. [scoffs] You can't fire me. -I just did. -What-- What the fuck is he-- Hey, what about all this shit about family, and the family business, and community? When's the last time you've been to family meal, Gabe? What the fuck? What-- What the fuck is he talking about? -Bye, Gabe. -What the fuck are you talking about? You're gonna fire me? Really? All right. What are you gonna do? You gonna-- You gonna kick me out? Come on, kick me out, Tim. Go ahead. Kick me out, Tim. Huh? This place doesn't happen without my name. Motherfucker. You think anyone gives a fuck about your podunk business degree from Ohio fucking State, Timmy? Say something. Yeah, exactly. All the time I put in this place. You know what? My brother's a lawyer. You both owe me a lot of fucking money. My fucking jacket. -You were just gonna stand there? -How dare you? You don't get to do that. Well, I just did, so it's too late. We just need to find a new bartender. No, fuck you. You find a new bartender. Is his brother really a lawyer? Hello. Hey. Hey, I've been trying to reach you. Can I borrow my sister a second? He's not my fucking boss. -Des is getting worse. -What do you mean, worse? He's starting to bleed. Serene's with him now. I told her to stay there. Are you okay? Uh, yeah. -Is your car here? -Across the street. Would you mind driving to Jersey? Jersey? [pensive music] [train horn blares] How do you get on a bus that many miles away, and end up in a motel with no money? And what is she even doing out here? Well, she said modeling, but it don't sound like-- [scoffs] Modeling. Wow. How does it even get to this? I mean, she still lives at home. What does that have to do with it? -Take the next exit. -Everything's paid for. School, everything. All she maybe needs is some pocket money. Kids need more than that. Okay, but does that mean you gotta sell your ass to get it? Whatever happened to babysitting? [sighs heavily] I thought it was Wood Ridge. You sure she didn't say Ridgewood or Woodbridge, which is a lot farther? [groans] I'm not a driver. I have to pee! I'm not talking about driving. Okay, fine. Let's go to Wood Ridge. Bridge. Woodbridge. We are in Wood Ridge. You know what? -Let's just go there. -Okay, fine! -Whatever. -Did Serene text you back yet? -Not yet. -Okay, better idea. Let's just wait to hear from her before we waste any more time. -You were copping at Rivington and Essex. -[heart monitor beeping] And I was waiting for you in the car. And I'm looking at the rearview mirror, and I see you running, like, feathers flying. And you're screaming, "He cut my puffy! He cut my puffy!" [both laughing] And I go and open the door for you, so he pins you up against the car, to take away that. Mm. He locked eyes with me, and I just said, "I don't have anything, and I'm on my period!" And he went running. You know, I loved that jacket. That was a ugly-ass beige jacket. -Wait, what you talking about? -I remember, 'cause that was the color that was officially banned in Studio 54. Hmm, fuck Studio 54. You just taped that shit right up, and kept wearing that ugly-ass goose down. Baby, that shit was eiderdown. And I would've rather they had cut me. [sighs] How did we survive? A little bit of luck. A lot of bit of grace. God, I loved you. [sighs] I never stopped. [heart monitor beeps] [both sigh heavily] You hear anything? -Nope. -I can't with this family. Ugh! This is my life. -I wasn't in your dorm. -I already told you. Fine. Anyway... -I tried to see Des. -When? Yesterday. He wouldn't see me. -Why? -I don't know. I guess he's still mad at me. [laughs wryly] Clearly, he's still holding on to whatever, to the bitter end. You know, he owes me money. And you two were so close. He took you everywhere. Took you to the clubs. -So, he took you, too. -Once. He took me to the Paradise garage once. Vince hoisted me up on one of those speakers, and disappeared. Remember those huge speakers? Of course. They were famous for them. I don't remember how I got down. Anyway, I was older. But he always took you. -Well, you weren't a dancer. -I know, I remember when I finally got the nerve to do The Hustle in front of y'all. [laughs] Y'all said I was doing "The Hassle." [both laughing] That was Des that said that. You laughed, though. -"Do The Hassle!" Doo-doo-doo-- -Oh, that shit was funny. "Do The Hassle!" I'll give him that. He was always funny. Hmm. At least he apologized. When he first got sober, he called me, and said he was sorry for all of it. Genuinely. Tearfully. Um, newsflash. He was doing his steps. That was Step Nine. [scoffs] Well, it meant a lot to me at the time, dismissive. -What's going on with Nina? -[sighs heavily] -Did something happen? -No. -What happened? -Nothing! Jesus! Nothing happened, Ida. Nothing happened. Everything's fine. She's fine. I don't wanna talk about it. -Sounds hunky-dory. -Can we not? Uh, sorry. But I had a bad feeling about that girl. Okay, what part of "I don't wanna talk about it" -are you not getting? -Okay. Clearly I don't wanna talk about her. You're fucking relentless. It's like you smell some shit in the air -where you could judge me, and you're salivating. -Salivating? -You know what your problem is? -Here we go. You think you can say whatever, however, to whoever. I am not the one, Daisy. Not today. You were never the one. You know what would've been nice? If I felt like I had a sister that I could fucking lean on. Someone who could support me without-- I've been supporting you from day one, mama. Yeah, if that's what you wanna tell yourself. Really? I'm the one who made you breakfast when Mom stopped functioning after Dad died. The one who dressed you, and fuckin' brushed your hair. The one who when Des wanted to be a total physical bully, would step in. That was me. Mm-hmm. You're welcome, Sis. -Can you stop? -You know what? -I can't do this. -Okay, let's just take a pause. Do whatever you want. Ida. [mournful music] [traffic rumbles] [sighs] [♪] [crickets chirp] Hi, um... Do you have a Constance Salcedo staying here? She also goes by Connie. Yeah, I can't give you that information. Yeah, I'm aware of the policy. But this is a bit of an emergency. So, then I would suggest calling the police. This is her. -[clerk] I'm not even allowed-- -I'm her aunt. I was just in another motel in the area, and they made an exception. Have you tried calling her? She's not picking up. I've been looking for her for hours. Her father's in critical condition, and I just really need to get in touch with her. Okay? So, can you just tell me if she's here? Just shake your head yes or no. Like I said, Ma'am, I can't do that. -You're not listening. -Good evening, can I help you? This is fucking bullshit. Really? What's your name? Great hospitality, Brandon. If something happens to her, if she's hurt in any way, it's on you. Constance! [knocking] Connie! Connie? [knocking] Constance! [knocking forcefully] You don't hear me calling your name? I was in the bathroom. Why the fuck aren't you answering your phone? Sorry, it was on silent. -Are you okay? -I'm good. What's going on? Are you on something? [scoffs] Yeah, I'm on something. 12 hours of 90 Day Fiancé. What are you doing out here? I had a job, but it didn't work out, so I didn't get paid. I don't know if you know, but I've been modeling. Yeah, I heard. So, this guy, this photographer was actually pretty talented. [scoffs] It's stupid. He wanted me to wear bunny ears. I don't do cosplay. And even if I did, that shit is corny. I mean, what is it, 1986? What? You gotta pack your stuff up. My friends are picking me up tomorrow. Yeah, I'm not leaving you out here. I'm good. I just need a little cash. [sighs] That's not an option. Why are you being so extra? Your father's in the hospital. [somber music] I'm sure you guys have a lot to talk about. Not really. Yeah, I get it. But when people are sick, it's-- I'm not gonna tell you what to do. Good. Actually, I am. You need to talk to him. I got nothing to say. Life goes by too quick. And there's this, and there's that. Fucking diseases. This is an opportunity. -Are you gonna talk to him? -I'd like to. Not sure how he feels. But you're his daughter. You two are a lot alike. When I was a kid, I worshiped him. He kind of saved my life. How? He made these fake VIP passes to Danceteria. He was very artistic. -That was a club, by the way. -I know. I would go there all the time. Dance my ass off. It was my only escape. -How old were you? -Irrelevant. My mom never tells me anything. I'm sure it's just all so hard for her. Did she really date Prince? -Who told you that? -She did. I don't know if dating is the word I'd use. My understanding is, they knew each other. And whenever he came into town, she would go to his hotel and wait for him there until he was done doing whatever he was doing. She had to dress a certain way, do her makeup and her hair exactly how he liked it. He once sent her a package of clothes. Thierry Mugler or something. And a bottle of Joy de Patou. She still has the bottle. That was the arrangement. Then one night, she was waiting, all ready for him. But he never showed up. Never returned her phone calls after that. I knew she was full of shit. [♪] Ohh. No. [sobs] No, no. [sobbing] My whole life I've been afraid of this. Hey, so, we'll pray for him. Since when do we pray? [sobbing] At least-- at least he didn't suffer. His liver failed. He was in excruciating pain. I'm sure they had painkillers. No! Not enough for this. There's no medicine that could numb this kind of pain. [sobbing] Hey. Hey. I'm here. I'm here. [whispering] I'm so sorry. I am so sorry. [whispering] I've got you, boo. It's okay. [sobbing] [whispering softly] [monitors beep] [sighs] What time did he die? [raspy voice] It's been a long night. They said they just cleared the room. Why didn't you have him call me? I tried. How hard is it to put the phone to his face? He felt he wasn't good enough. Because you told him that. -I never said that. -You left him. -I had to. -You kept him away. Well, he knew where you were. How is this my fault? I called you! You didn't tell me shit. I've been trying to reach you for days. Can we all just please calm down? You could've just sent a fucking car to get me. I sent Ida! I wanted you to be with family. And now I never will. Nice work, bitch. -Hey. -I'm sorry I couldn't give you what you needed to be a decent human being. [scoffs] Did you need to say that to her right now? You're not a mother. [sighs] [traffic rumbles] [sobs] I know. [gentle music] [♪] [singing wordlessly] -Ooh! -Oh, hey. -Mm-mm-mm-mm! -Hey! Those are for the boys. All right, here we go. [men cheering] [man] All right! -All right, here we go. I'm in. -That's good. -[man] Oh, look who can go large. -[all laughing] [yawns] Mm! This is exactly what I wanted. Hmm. -Can I vape? -Hmm, I'd rather you didn't. -It's only water vapor. -Yeah, I don't care. If you need it, I'll give you a little CBD. -You nervous? -No. You got this. Test me. Okay. Margarita. Tequila, fresh lime juice, and triple sec. What? Manhattan. Whiskey. -Or bourbon, they'll let you know. Uh, sweet vermouth and bitters. Anything else? You're missing something. A cherry. I know. Mm-mm. Sidecar. Orange liqueur, lemon juice, cog-nac. [laughs] It's Cognac, "nya." Enye. Cognac. So what? I know how to make it. Yeah, well, now you know how to say it. So, we have some news. [chuckles] We may have found our new bartender. If it's okay with you. -Why do I need permission? -That's fine with me. That's so exciting! In addition to getting her butt back in school. Can I go make us some cocktails? Sure. What you got? It's a surprise. Okay. [soft music playing over speakers] [clears throat] [dog whines] What's this? -She said it's an emotional-- -No. -[Lindsay] But it's the law. -It's okay. I'll take care of it. Be right back. [forced laugh] Hi. I'm sorry, you can't have your dog in here. -I have dog allergies. -[woman] Really? [Daisy] I'm the owner. Have a great day. [woman scoffs] I'm so tired of people and their fake service dogs. -Yeah, how do you know it's fake? -Look at her. You know, I looked into getting one of those certificates. -It's easier than you think. -Mm-hmm! What's happening over here? You ladies gonna order today or what? Well, I have a couple of questions. -Yes? -The quinoa bowl. -What about it? -[Selene chuckles] Do they toast the quinoa first? Do they toast the quinoa? I have no idea. I'll find out for you, though. You know what? Fuck it. I'm gonna have a burger. -Go crazy. -Uh, me too. -Eggs Benedict with avocado. -Oh, nachos for me, Tim. -You got it, love. -Oh, and you know what? -Yes? -Get us a bowl of quinoa for the table. -Coming right up. -Thank you, Tim. This looks fancy! What'd you make us? It's called Slap Your Mama. That's delicious. Okay! Uh-- [laughs] Um... to family. A familia.
