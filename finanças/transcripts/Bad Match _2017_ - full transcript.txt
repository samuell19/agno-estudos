You must be Rachel. - Yeah. - Hey. Oh. Oh, sorry, I'm a hugger. That's, that's okay. I'm super awkward at the beginning of these things. Oh, well, that is why they invented alcohol. Hey, man, uh, could we get one more scotch, and for Rachel, a-- wait, wait. Uh, let me guess. What are you doing? Oh, I can sense a person's drink aura. I just need a moment of silence. My drink aura? [exhales] [giggles] Sorry. Vodka tonic. Yeah. Wait, wait, wait, I'm also seeing tequila shots. Rach, I don't know about that. I did not think that. Far be it from me to tell a lady no. Two tequila shots. Thanks, man. You don't mess around, huh? I guess not. [Harris laughs] Leaving? Oh, hey, yeah. Didn't want to wake you. I got work in the morning. Plus, I have self-diagnosed restless leg syndrome, so. [Rachel laughs] But, uh, hey. [Harris laughs] I had a lot of fun. Me too. All right, sleep tight. [phone alarm ringing] [electronica music] Boom! Got you again, ShadowMan. [Shadow] Suck my dick, pussy. No, come on, man. It's too early for that kind of talk. [Shadow] It's not too early for your mom to suck my dick. Eh, clever. [ShadowMan groans] Oh, and I win again. See you next time, Shadow. Hope you have a good day in school. What grade you in again? [Shadow] You have a good day being a fag. Easy with the homophobia there, kid. [Shadow] Shut up. You got it. Hey. Hey, morning. What's up, man? Mandarin, Jose. 150 likes. Fuckin' clickbait. Cute, who's she? She's my ex. She used to call blow jobs blowies. Now she's engaged to Richard Rodemeier. This fuckin' bald piece of shit. Looks like a banker. What do you think he does? You think he banks? Let's have a look. Pediatric surgeon at Ralph M. Captain Children's Hospital. Oh, no. That's a bummer. Whatever, man, he still looks like a piece of shit. Of that I have no doubt. You should unfriend her, man. It's not healthy, you can drive yourself crazy. I know, I know, man. I just can't help it. Robby, boom. Harris, Robby, morning. - Hi. - Hey, Terri. The partners and I made a decision about the Harry's Auto Insurance spot. You both had damn good ideas. But Harris, we're going with you. Thanks, Terri. Well, they're gonna be here on Wednesday. You'll be ready to pitch by then? Absolutely. Excellent, keep up the good work. You too, Robby. Better luck next time, Robert. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Think you just got it all figured out, don't you? I like to think so, yeah. [soft rock music] Linda, 26. "I like adventure, whiskey, sarcasm, Jenga." She's cute, should I go left or right? It's your choice, man. Mm-mm. It's your profile. Eh, I pretty much always swipe right. Even if you don't like 'em? That's putting the cart before the horse. At this point, it's just a numbers game. Say you swipe right 100 times a day, right? Out of those 100 likes, you get 20 matches, out of those 20 matches, you message 10, out of those 10, only a handful message back, and out of that handful, you end up meeting up with one. What that means is, the more you like initially, the higher your chances are of meeting up with someone later. - The Tao of swiping. - [Harris laughs] I'm gonna swipe right, here we go. Boom! - It's a match. God damn. - Thank you very much. Technology, it's a great thing. You know, if this was around when I was single-- Yeah? [Chuck inhales deeply] Okay, keep browsing. Oh! What about this one? Uh, I'm sorry, Mr. Tzu, I apologize sincerely. Okay. No match. I'm sorry. It's all right, it happens. Oh, you're getting a text from Lauren. Uh-huh. Oh, dear, I gotta split. Lemme guess. - Lauren. - Mm-hmm. She's another match I'm guessing? That is correct. What happened to the last one? - What last one? - Uh, wow. I guess it's hard to keep track of both. I don't know her name, the last one you saw. Is that what you do, you go see them? - Oh, you mean Rachel. - Rachel, Rachel. Yes, she's cool. Yeah, we had fun. I just didn't get the girlfriend vibe. Oh, okay, what's the girlfriend vibe? Well, you know how you felt when you first met Lydia? [Chuck] Yeah? Yeah, well, I felt, not that. Okay, yeah, I see. Oh, there she is. Wait, you had her come here? [Harris] Yeah, so? Dude, I thought we were gonna part ways. We are. I'm gonna go to that table over there. You're ridiculous. Hey! I'm Harris. This is for you. Thank you. Jeez. Can I get you a drink? Sure! Wait, let me guess. [phone vibrating] [ominous music] [phone alarm ringing] [message alert ringing] Well, hello. [ambient office noise] [sighs] - 'Sup? - Yo. Who is that? Girl I matched with. Seems to be really into Sonic the Hedgehog. Listen, um, can you do me a favor? What's that? Can we swap dicks just for tonight? [upbeat electronica music] - Guess who? - Whoa! Gotcha. Scared the shit out of me. Whoops! You know how to make an intro, huh? I tend to just go for the hug. Is this for me? Uh, yes, actually. It's kind of cheesy, but. Very sweet of you. Hey there. - Hi. - What can I do for you? Uh, can I get a-- Wait, wait, wait, let me guess. I'm seeing, red. Uh, vodka cranberry. Oh, my God, yeah. Wait, I'm also seeing tequila shots. Yeah, I love tequila shots. All right, here we go. I like your hair, it's different. Oh, yeah, I need to update my pics. They're like three weeks old. No, it's cool. Can I tell you something embarrassing? I'd be offended if you didn't. When I was a little kid, I got my hair bleached like Eminem. - No, you didn't. - Yeah, I did. Totally. Take that secret to the grave. Yeah. All right, a vodka cranberry. Tequila shots. Thank you, sir. All right. Down the hatch. I haven't thought about some of these games since I was a little kid. I mean, I used to be a huge Sonic fan back in the day. Oh, my God, are you fuckin' serious? Sonic is like my life. - You don't say? - Yeah! I beat the game once, no cheat codes. No, I always thought Chaos Emeralds would be a great band name. That's genius. Shall we? Yeah. [soft rock music] Oh, my God, I love this song. What? Falling Still? Seriously? I know these guys. - Personally. - No, you don't. Uh-huh, did the ad campaign for their new album. They got a show coming up, we should go. I'll get us backstage. I would fucking love that. All right. You know, I knew we'd get along. I could tell just from your profile pic. I knew. What's your sign? Uh, Virgo, I think. Oh, my God! I'm a Pisces, we're like the most compatible signs. Well, what do you know? [chuckles] [phone message ringing] Oh, fuck. - What? - My ex just liked my post. I'm sorry? I think he's just trying to fuck with me. By liking your, uh-- I have the best idea. Uh. Act like you're having a good time. Okay. Oh, my God, that's great. You're a good actor. We make a good team. [moaning] Hi. Hey! Hey. I'm just gonna head out, okay? You don't want to sleep over? I, I got work tomorrow, so. Well, you can just leave from here in the morning. Venice is kinda far from where I work. Plus, I gotta shower. Well, you could just shower here. I could, but, you know, gotta change and everything, so. I might have a couple of shirts you could borrow. Don't worry, they're my brother's. It's just a lot easier if I go home. What are you doing tomorrow? Maybe we could do this again? Uh, yeah. Oh, no, I've gotta work on a pitch, but, call you as soon as I get free? Maybe this weekend? Yeah, maybe. Okay. All right. [Riley] Sleep well, good night. Don't gamble with your car insurance. Still too long. We're at a casino. Blackjack table; we take a look at our hand. 16, the dreaded. [phone ringing] Oh, Christ, lemme. [clears throat] We're at a casino. Blackjack table. [phone ringing] "Hey, what's up? "What are you doing?" Trying to work is what I'm doing. We're at a casino, blackjack table. [phone vibrating] Jesus fucking Christ. Okay. [phone ringing] Mm-hmm, shut the fuck up. [clears throat] We're at a ca-- [phone vibrating] jeez fuck! I'm gonna kill this girl if she doesn't. Well, hello. [upbeat rock music] I brought wine. ♫ Everyone's a victim ♫ Victim every day ♫ Everyone is looking at me ♫ Don't know what they've heard ♫ Hell no ♫ Hell no [phone vibrating] Oh, God. [phone vibrating] - Hello? - [Robby] Finally! Dude, are you in the hospital or something? Robby? The hospital? What are you. Holy shit, holy fucking shit! [Robby] Yeah, dude, you missed the meeting, man. Fuck! God, what happened? My alarm didn't go off. [Robbie] Dude, I don't know, man. You gotta remember to set that shit. Oh, fuck, are they still there? Do I have time to-- [Robby] They're gone, dude, they left. Oh, my God, what happened? [Robby] Look, everything's fine. They left totally happy. They had no idea anything was wrong. But how? [Robby] Look, we had to use my pitch, man. - We didn't have a choice. - Fuck! Why didn't you call me, man, before the pitch? [Robby] I literally have been calling you non-stop. Why didn't you try again? [Robby] I tried, dude. Well, just forget it. How's Terri? [Robby] What do you think, man? - She's pissed! - Fuck! All right, I'm coming in now. Where the fuck are my shoes? Is everything okay? No, no, everything's not okay. My alarm didn't go off or something, I missed my meeting, and now I don't even know if I have a job anymore. Fuck. I think. I think I accidentally shut it off. - What? - It woke me up, and I sort of just hit the button and fell asleep. Why would you do that? I don't know, reflex I guess. I am so sorry. Please don't be mad. No, no, you know what? It's fine, it's. - You drive here? - I took an Uber. Harris, I'm really, really sorry. No, it's fine, I just, uh. You know, I have to leave, I don't have time to drive you, so. Of course, I'll get an Uber. Okay, it's gonna be here in six minutes. Have you seen my shirt? Uh, I can't wait that long. Just leave me here. I'll go as soon as the Uber gets here. Fine, just lock up when you leave. Toss my keys. Harris, I feel really shitty about this. I am so sorry. - Harris? - Yeah? Terri wants to see you in her office. Yeah. You wanna explain what happened? It was my alarm. What about it? I was up late last night working on the pitch, and I put my phone on silent 'cause it kept going off, and when I went to bed I guess I never turned the volume back up, so. when my alarm went off, I just didn't hear it. You are aware that they make actual alarm clocks, right? I know, it's a terrible excuse, Terri, but it's the truth. You knew how important today was. I did. I'm so sorry. Do I still have a job? Yeah, you still have a job, barely. But you're off Harry's. Robby did the pitch, Robby gets the job. And I'm gonna need 500 words on Waldo's Scented Matches by Friday, got it? Understood. [phone vibrating] - No, I didn't respond. - [Chuck] Why not? 'Cause she wants me to lose my job. What kind of a nut job shuts off someone's alarm? Didn't she say it was an accident? I don't know. In my experience, girls who change their hair all the time aren't exactly emotionally stable. Then why did you see her again? Dude, come on, serious? Yeah, okay, look. I just think that this could be a sign. Yeah, man, I'm not so interested in signs right now, I kinda just wanna chill out, play some video games, and go to bed. All right, all right, all right, fine, okay. Look, I'll let you go, but can I just give you one little piece of advice? One little piece of advice before I go? Lay it on me, oh great mystic. Okay, look, I think that this may be-- What? Chuck? Losing you, Chuck? [muffled music] [loud rock music] ♫ I pissed away ♫ Every single day ♫ And all my mistakes, I take the blame ♫ And it feels okay because ♫ I've never Hey. Jesus, Riley. Why are you still... You didn't answer my texts. Uh, yeah, no, I'm sorry. I should've gotten back to you. [suspenseful music] I was just trying to tell you I was sorry about this morning. Yeah, sure, yeah, of course. Just relax, okay? There's no reason for anyone to get hurt. Hurt? This? Oh, my God, I'm cooking dinner. I'm making chicken stir fry. I felt so bad about today, and I wanted to make it up to you, so I thought I'd do something nice and cook you dinner. So you broke into my apartment? No! Actually, I never really left except for when I went to go buy groceries. But, you know. You could've told me, Riley. I tried, but you didn't text me back. Plus, I thought it would be a nice surprise. This was a bad idea, wasn't it? Uh, no. - You think I'm crazy. - No, I don't. Ill-advised maybe. I just, I already ate, and I got - a bunch of work to do. - Consider me gone. This was almost done anyway. But it smells amazing. So, tell you what, I will have it for lunch tomorrow. Really? So this wasn't like deal-breaker stuff? No! Come on. What's a little breaking and entering between friends, huh? [Riley giggles] Good. 'Cause I think I might like you, Harris. I think I might like you too. Okay, let me get out of your hair. I'll just get my stuff, and good luck with work. Uh, I'll text you later? Okay, bye. [sighs] I think I might like you. to never talk to me again. Hey, Shadow, is it possible you got worse since we last played? [Shadow] I've been busy. Let me guess, fucking my mom? [Shadow] No, fucking your sister! [rapid gunfire] You have, like, other insults, right? Creative ones? [Shadow] Suck my dick. [pinging] "Hi, baby, how are you? "What are you doing?" Oh, there he goes. [phone ringing] Gotta be kidding me. [Shadow] What's the matter? Don't like getting your ass kicked? I wasn't talking to you, ShadowMan. [Shadow] Yeah, right. Actually dealing with a girl! Ever had a girlfriend before? [Shadow] Yeah! I'm not talking about the body pillow you sleep with at night, I'm talking about a real live human girl. [Shadow] I don't have a body pillow. You should get one. It's gonna be a long time before any girl not stuffed with goose down wants to sleep with you, so. Wait, Shadow, you. Oh, he quit? Well. Guess he had enough. [phone vibrating] Hey. I'm gonna go down to the shooting stage if you wanna roll. Uh-huh, yeah, one sec. Is that that girl again? Fourth time today, it's not even noon. Maybe it's important. Trust me, it's not. - Uh, Harris? - Yeah? I've got a call for you. Can you take a message? Uh, well, it's your mom. She said it's urgent. My mom? Should call my cell. Dude, I'm right behind you. - Mom? - Harris. - Mom, is that you? - There's been an accident. - Mom, you sound kinda-- - I peed my pants. - Who is? - [Riley laughs] - Riley? - [Riley] Got you! - How'd you get this number? - [Riley] Online! You weren't answering your cell. So I just figured-- I wasn't answering my cell 'cause I'm at work. Look, I have to go, they're shooting a spot, - I'm gonna be late. - Just a second. It's important. Fine, what is it? [Riley] The Falling Still concert is tonight. You called me at my office to see if I want to go to a concert with you? [Riley] Well, you said that you would take me when they come to town. Yeah, you know what, it's kind of short notice. Look, Riley, I've gotta go, okay? [Riley] Maybe we could do something else then? Like, dinner and a movie? Yeah, you know what, I think I'm just gonna take it easy tonight, so. [Riley] So, maybe just Netflix and chill? I could bring wine? Yeah, I'm not feeling so great. [coughs] So I'm just gonna stay home and get to bed early, but we'll hang out soon. - Okay? - [Riley] Okay. - Feel better. - Okay, I will. Thank you. Oh, shit. [upbeat music] [metal clangs] What the fuck, guy? Sorry, everyone. [Director] All right, let's go again. [rock music] [Lydia] It's called oil pulling. Oil pulling? Yeah, you swish coconut oil in your mouth for 10 minutes every day. It's supposed to be really good for you. Yeah, I don't see how that could possibly be true. It's true! Uh-huh. See, it says right here: "Swishing with coconut oil for 10 minutes every day "will strengthen gum and help fight tooth decay." Yeah, okay, but look at the name of the site. All right, that doesn't sound like the most reputable site to me, I'm sorry, it's true. Yeah, but look at the comments. Everyone says it works. Comments? Anyone can write. I have an article right here which says that oil pulling has no proven effect on oral health. Oh, yeah? And what site is that? Oh, my God, yeah. Totally better. - Most trustworthy source. - What? It's-- Oh, my god, you've gotta be kidding me. [Lydia] What's up? It's this girl, she's obsessed. I mean, she's certifiable. I'm just glad I don't have any pets. - [Chuck] Oh, come on. - I'm serious! Man, okay. She called me today. [gasps] No! She is insane! Did she use a landline? Arm yourself, Harris. This is all a joke to you guys now, but when I'm found dead, I hope you think about this, and it makes you very, very sad. Okay, Harris, I'll bite. How can we help you? I wish I knew. Here's an idea. Stop fucking every girl you meet online. I'm serious! This girl, what's her name? - Riley. - Riley. Did you ever actually wanna date Riley? Or did you just use her because you thought she'd be an easy lay? Okay, I didn't use anybody. Mm-hmm. Correct me if I'm wrong, but the order of events seems to be you met her, you fucked her, you ignored her. What does that sound like to you? Chuck, a little help? Uh, yeah, uh, look. I think that she has a point, Harris. I mean, look, it doesn't seem like you want anything more from these girls other than to just, you know, have sex. Okay, okay, 'cause you two have been out of the game for so long, let me give you a little refresher. Nobody is doing this shit because they're in search of true love. They may say they are, but they're lying. - [Lydia] And what do they want? - They want to meet someone, get laid, and bring their boring lives a little excitement. It's like going to a bar on a Friday night minus everything that sucks about a bar on a Friday night. Or maybe that's what you want. Ever thought about that? Or were you just too busy thinking about yourself? Okay. You know what? You're right. I screwed up, I admit it. Thank you! I screwed up by being a slave to my genitals and sleeping with the same lunatic twice against my better judgment. - [Riley] Harris? - Riley? I thought you said you were sick. Uh, how long have you been standing there? [Riley] Who's Lydia? Okay, uh, you know what? We should step outside. How did you know where I was? Some girl named Lydia checked you in on Facebook. Who is she? Um, Lydia is my best friend's girlfriend. Chuck, Lydia, this is Riley. - Hey. - Hi. So you're not sick? Uh, I was feeling, but, you know, I kind of felt better-- Oh, God, just stop it, Harris. You think because I'm some lunatic you can lie to me and I'll believe you? Heard that, huh? You said you liked me. Yeah, yeah, totally, you're great. You don't give a shit about me, do you? You just wanted to make your boring, little life a little more exciting, is that it? Or was it my life that was boring? Okay, can we just, can we just calm down? You think I'm just some fuck toy you can have your way with and never call again, is that it? Whoa, just relax, all right? I never meant to hurt your feelings. Oh, I'm sure you didn't. I'm sure you never thought about my feelings at all, did you? Did you, you fucking piece of shit? You fucking asshole. Riley! You can fuck off and die, Harris. Way to go, Lydia. [rock music] Sorry. [crickets chirping] [foreboding music] [woman shrieks] [maniacal laughter] [suspenseful music] Hello? [clattering] If anybody's in here, I'm calling the police. [creaking] Hello? [Riley] We were supposed to be together forever. Riley? If I can't have you, no one can. [screaming] [phone alarm ringing] [ominous music] [Chuck] That's why it's good to have a good woman to go home to, you know? Someone who could rub your feet. [Harris] Oh, shut up. [Chuck] All right, man, I'll see you. [Harris] Yeah, dude, my keys are in your pack. [Chuck] Oh, yeah. I guess you will be needing those. [Harris] I will be needing those. [Chuck] Keys. [Harris] Mm-hmm, thank you. [Chuck] So, I mean do you want this phone or-- [Harris] Ah, you can keep that, that's fine. [Chuck] All right, man, I'll see you. [Harris] All right, see you, man. You gotta be fucking kidding me. [Chuck] What? [Harris] Riley, she's still harassing me. She was texting me the whole time we were up hiking. [Chuck] Whoa, what she say? [Harris] I don't know, man, I'm not gonna read 'em. I'm gonna delete 'em, gonna block her, and move on. [Chuck] Oh, no, no, no, come on, man. It's not like you gotta respond. Hey, hey, I'm curious. - Oh, you're curious? - Yeah. [Harris] Please, go right ahead. Have fun, just delete 'em when you're done. [Chuck] This is like the highlight of my life. She says Bye. [Harris] Oh, well, finally, she gets it. [Chuck] Bye! [laughs] Whoa. Whoa, you might wanna look at this. [Harris] Dude, I honestly just don't care. [Chuck] No, no, no, Harris. I'm serious. [Harris] What the fuck? She's not trying to say she's gonna, she's gonna kill herself? [Chuck] Yeah, that's what it looks like. [Harris] Oh, come on, this is just fucking ridiculous, no. [Chuck] Whoa, whoa, you're not concerned? [Harris] No, man! Why should I be? She's just trying to get my attention. [Chuck] Okay, that doesn't mean she's lying. [Harris] Dude, come on. Who sends a suicide note by text? [Chuck] Well, I read about this woman in Taiwan who live streamed her suicide. This stuff happens. Hey. - What, there's more, right? - There's a video. [Chuck] Okay. - Oh, wow. - [Harris] What the fuck? No, no, no, I mean, come on. Say this is real, what the fuck am I supposed to do about it? - You gotta help her. - Help her? She's not my responsibility, man! [Chuck] Come on, you can't be serious, Harris. [Harris] Fuck, just, fuck! [Chuck] Look, just call 911. [Harris] I'm not calling 911, man. This is a fucking prank-- [Chuck] No, then call her. [Harris] No, that's what she wants. That's exactly what she wants me to do. [Chuck] Okay, so let her die, let her die just so you don't have to see her again. [Harris] No one's gonna die! This is a fuck! You know what, fine. You know what? I'll call her and you'll see. It's ringing. - Harris? - Riley? Stop messing around. [Riley] Harris, is that you? [Harris] Yes, you got me to call. Now, Riley, just stop. [Riley] I'm tired. [Harris] Riley, stop messing around. [Riley] I just wanted to hear your voice one last time. Riley, please, come on, just stop it, it's not funny. Riley? Riley? Riley, is this for real? - [Riley] Bye, Harris. - No, wait, wait. Riley, what did you take and when did you take it? [Riley] Pills. Pills from my dad's back surgeries, and whiskey-- All right, Riley, stay where you are. I'm gonna call 9-1-1. [Riley] No. Riley, I'm calling the ambulance. What's your address? [Riley] No ambulance, you come. Fine, fine. I'll come. Riley, what's your address? Riley, Riley, talk to me! [Riley] 1738 Palm Drive, apartment four. Okay, I'm coming. All right, man, I gotta go. - All right. - I'll call you! - Yeah, let me know. - Yeah. Riley! Riley! Where the fuck are you? Riley, talk to me. Fuck! Riley? Riley, please. Oh, my God. Oh, shit. What the fuck? Come on, come on. Where's the fucking pulse? Oh, thank God, come on. Come on, come on, come on. Come on! Come on, fucking come on. Come on, Riley, think of-- [Riley giggles] What the fuck? Gotcha. You've gotta be fucking kidding me. This is a prank? Yeah, a fucking good one. [Riley laughing] You should see your face right now. How does it feel, Harris? To be made a fool of. Shitty? [glass shattering] What the fuck is wrong with you? You're a fucking psycho, Riley. Never contact me again. [shouting] Fuck! [panting] Dude, what happened to your hand? Fuck, just, um, nothing. Just cut it. How? Cooking. You cook? Dude, you goose, I didn't know you cooked. What'd you make? Dude, don't you have work to do? Harris! Man, I was just asking. I need to see you in my office right now. - Would you, please? - All right. [Robby sighs] Shut the door. Have a seat. You're in charge of the CCG Twitter account, right? Yeah. You sent out a series of tweets last night. Series of tweets? Uh. Okay. "This company is retarded." "My co-workers are retarded." "My boss is retarded." "I'm sick of working around so many retards." And it goes on like this. You want me to keep going? Is this a joke? I don't know, you tell me. No? I'm sorry, Terri, I'm very confused right now. Me too. You don't actually think I wrote those? The tweets came from your account. Yeah, but I didn't write them. Then who was it? Riley. You gotta be shitting me. - Excuse me? - No, sorry, not you. Uh, I know who's responsible for this, I can fix it. Even if you didn't write them, it's not quite that simple. What do you mean? Shit. Are you all right, man? Yeah, I'm fine. I can help you. Will you, shit! Just fuck it. [Robby] Don't you want your stuff? [brooding music] [phone trilling] [Riley] Hi, you've reached Riley's phone. Goddammit! Riley! Fuck. [phone trilling] [Riley] Hi, you've reached Riley's phone. Leave a message after the beep or just be a normal person and text me. Enough is enough, Riley, you have to call me back. This isn't a fucking joke anymore. Call me back, now! [phone vibrating] Riley? [Man] This is credit card services. Goddammit! [knocking] Just a minute! - You Harris Kroller? - Yeah. We have a court order to search the premises. What do you mean, like a--like a search warrant? What? Yeah, exactly, where's your computer? Uh, it's right there. What the, what the fuck are you doing? Guys, could you just-- You want to tell Detective Rich where your laptop is? I know you got a laptop. Well, guys, what is going on here? I'm sorry, but. What's going on is we need to have a look at your computer, your laptop, your telephone, your Xbox, anything you had access to the internet with. What, why? [Detective Rich] Why don't you hand me that bottle you got there. Listen, just take a seat, take a seat, relax. [tense music] Look, where's the laptop, just tell us. You know we can legally tear this place apart from top-- It is in the bedroom, I think. I don't. Could you? What the fuck? Wait, wait, possession of child pornography? - What? - Got it. No, this has to be some kind of giant mistake. I don't have any child porn. [Detective Dean] Yeah, well, an IP address matching the one from this apartment was flagged last night for downloading over five gigabytes of illegal data from servers that we monitor, so. But, no, I didn't download any child porn last night. I got drunk and fell asleep on my couch, that's it. So you were here last night? - Yeah, but-- - Found it. In a folder marked Private. No, that's impossible. You're lying. Hey, take it easy. You're under arrest. You're under arrest for the possession of child pornography. You have the right to remain silent. I would recommend that you use it. Okay. Hello. You are Harris Kroller? Phew. [sighs] My name is Ronald Dale and I will be your lawyer. I took a look at your case, you got a clean record, which is good. So, if we plead guilty-- I didn't do anything. I'm being set up. By whom? A girl, her name is Riley Miller. Or, I don't know, that could be a lie too, come to think of it. [Ronald] You don't know her name? I know her address. [Ronald] She's your ex-girlfriend? No, that crazy bitch? No fuckin' way. Met her online and now she wants revenge or something. - What for? - I don't know. For not being madly in love with her? I'm telling you, this girl is certifiably insane. Has she been in your home or had access to your computer within the last 48 hours? No. [Ronald] Does she have hacking skills? She got into my Twitter account and posted a bunch of tweets that got me fired. All right, and you have proof of this? I, no. Oh, well, either way, figuring out a Twitter password and hacking into an IP address are two wildly different skill sets. Besides, the files were found on your local hard drive, which means the hacker would have had to gain remote access to your computer, so-- Yeah, I don't know how she did it, but I'm telling you it wasn't me. Okay, write down her name and address and I will look into it. But I'm gonna level with you, Harris, what you're claiming is gonna be very hard to prove without a confession. If this goes to trial and you're convicted, you're looking at serious jail time. If you plead guilty, there's a very strong chance I can get you off with just a fine. [Harris] Which would be what? I don't know. Numbers could be 50, could be 100. Thousand? Better than five years in a federal prison. Holy fuck. This cannot be happening. Well, it is. We go before a judge by the end of the week. If we don't have anything real to back up your claims by then, I strongly suggest pleading guilty. Now, is there anyone that you can call to bail you out? Uh. I don't have my phone, I don't know anyone's numbers. I could send a Facebook message. [soft music] ♫ So lately been wondering ♫ Who will be there to take my place ♫ When I'm gone [Bartender] Last call for alcohol! Harris! What, what? ♫ Shadows on your face I think maybe you've had enough. Let me take you home. Home. My home is either gonna be a jail cell or a fuckin' park bench, because my life is ruined. And all for what, 'cause some psychotic bitch felt spurned. There's gotta be something you can do, right? ♫ Way up high or down low According to my lawyer, barring a full confession from Riley, I'm looking at, best case scenario, a crippling fine and a spot on the registered sex offenders list. So I will be a convicted felon, won't be able to get a job, won't be able to leave town, can't vote. It's not like you even voted before. I'm sorry, man, I know, it's not funny. I'm just trying to lighten the mood here. ♫ Well I hope there's someone out there ♫ Who can bring me back to you Hey. Who knows? Maybe Riley might have a change of heart. She might admit to everything. Why? Why would she do that? Huh? There's no way to prove she did anything. She, she, she's fucking crazy. She hates me. There's no reason for her to. What? Think I just figured a way outta this. Gotta go. No, no, no, no, Harris! I gotta fuckin' go, Chuck. ♫ And bring me back to you ♫ If I could [knocking] Riley? Riley, it's Harris. [Riley] What do you want? I just want to talk to you. [Riley] It's 2:30 in the morning. Yeah, I know, I'm sorry. I just, uh. Doing a lot of soul searching these last few days and, uh. I just really, I'd really like to talk to you, you know? Face to face. I... Please, it'll just take a few minutes. Thanks for letting me in, uh. Just, um, make it quick. I was about to go to sleep, so. Yeah. Uh. Just came by to say that, uh. Say that I'm sorry for everything. I, um. I wasn't a good person to you and that's not who I am. Or, I mean, at least it's not who I want to be and... So, I'm sorry that I hurt you and I'm sorry that I used you and I'm sorry that. Sorry I made you feel like you didn't matter. I wish I could say I had some kind of excuse, but... [scoffs] I'm just a selfish asshole who didn't care about anybody's feelings but his own. Why are you telling me this? 'Cause I don't wanna be that person anymore. And it took what happened between us for me to realize that and... So, I just wanted to say I'm sorry and, I guess thank you for showing me how fucked up I was. Well. You're welcome, I guess. You wanna hug it out? [laughs] You know me, I'm a hugger. Sure. Well, I'll let you get some sleep. Thanks for letting me talk. [ominous music] Wait. I want to apologize too. For what? You really hurt me, Harris, and it sucked, but, um... I lashed out and it wasn't fair to you. - It's okay. - No. No, it's not okay. That fake suicide stunt I pulled was not cool and I, I kind of do that stuff a lot. Anyway, I'm sorry. It's all right. I guess we kind of both lost our heads there. [Riley laughs] Yeah. Is there anything else? Like what? I don't know, um... anything else you want to come clean about? Like, that you did to me. I don't, I don't, uh, know what you're talking about, Harris. So you don't know anything about any child pornography on my laptop? The what? I know it was you, Riley. [Riley laughs] Okay. I, you need to leave. I'll leave if you admit what you did. - Let go of me. - Just admit it. Just admit it. Just admit what you did. Let go of me or I'll scream. You're not gonna scream. Just calm down. [Riley screams] Stop! Just shut up! Why are you doing this? Why do you want to ruin my life? [Harris grunting] [Riley screaming] [Roommate] Are you okay? - Call the police! - No, don't! Tell the cops what you did, Riley, or I'm coming back here, I swear to God. [Riley whimpering] [Ronald] Harris, it's Ronald Dale. What the hell did you do last night? Nothing, I was home all night. [Ronald] You're lying. You were at that woman's place last night, Miller? How the hell do you know that? [Ronald] Because she wants to file a restraining order against you. She claims you attacked her last night. What were you thinking, Harris? Do you understand how bad this looks for us? It practically negates your entire defense, which is thin to begin with. I didn't attack her, I was trying to get her to confess. This is another of her manipulations. She's trying to play us. [Ronald] I checked her out, Harris. She's got alibis during the time the files were downloaded. Pictures on Instagram, updates on Facebook, I mean, the girl puts her whole life online, but unfortunately for you that works against us. She hired someone then. [Ronald] It's possible, but don't try and do any more detective work yourself. You have two days. Lay low and think about what I told you. I can keep you out of prison, but not if you keep mucking it up for yourself. Okay? [intense music] What should be your name? Robby Barnett. Oh, Riley, Riley, Riley. You really should keep your profile private, babe, there's creeps out there. "Aced my Behavioral Psych final! "Time to celebrate!" Okay. [tense music] All right, let's do this. Come on, Riley, where are you? Where are you? There you are. [phone vibrating] That's it. Do some swiping. I know you want to find some other guy to terrorize. [phone chimes] [Harris laughs] Hey, do I know you? I think we have Behavioral Psych together. Come on, Riley, respond. Come on, come on. Come on, come on. There we go. I usually sit in the back. How'd you do on the final? Aced it. You? Same. What you doing tonight? We should celebrate. [phone chimes] "I'll be at the Virgil, you should drop by." Mm, yes. I'll be there. Shit. ♫ No time to come ♫ Your race is run ♫ No time to shine ♫ All cloaked in gloom ♫ You broke too soon ♫ And left behind too late [phone vibrating] ♫ Why do you wait ♫ To see the golden gate ♫ The many hearts we found ♫ Would not be hard [rock music] ♫ My girl says so ♫ Got a style Hey, can I get a vodka cranberry please? Hey, can I get a vodka cranberry? Of course. That'll be ten dollars. Great, thank you. [techno hip hop music] [techno music] That guy Robby's here. I'm gonna go meet him. [muffled shrieking] Riley. Riley, relax. Riley, calm down. Riley, for God's sake. I told you to fuckin' stop. Jesus. You see what you've done to me? You see what you've turned me into? I have never hurt anybody in my entire life and I don't want to tonight, Riley, I don't, do you understand? Good. If you do exactly what I tell you to do, this all ends tonight. Is that what you want? Good, me too, me too, that's what I want. So I'm gonna take that gag off so you can talk, but you're not gonna scream, okay? Okay. Put this away. Taking it off now. [panting] See? Cooperating. This doesn't have to be difficult, Riley. Where am I? You don't need to know. All you need to know is that it's just you and me here all weekend if that's what it takes. Oh, and don't bother trying to escape 'cause we're locked up nice and tight. That guy Robby, that was you the whole time? A little taste of your own medicine, huh? [phone vibrating] That's my friends. I bet they're looking for me. They've been texting you for a few hours now, that's why, um, that's why I need your passcode. What? I need to unlock your phone. Can I get your passcode? And just remember, Riley, whatever happens next is entirely up to you. 0-9-0-2. Ah, voila. Thank you, Riley. See, if the rest of the night goes just like this, we'll be done in no time. Okay. How's it look? [Harris clears throat] Left with Robby. No need to wait up. Ooh, Brunch tomorrow? Sent. See what happens. Oh, look, she's typing. "Slut." "Call me tomorrow." That takes care of that. And you will call her tomorrow, as long as you don't give me any trouble with this next part. What do you want? I want a full confession. I don't know what you want me to confess to. Goddammit, Riley, I thought we weren't gonna do this. I'm cooperating, I just don't know what you want. Just stop! For fuck's sake, enough of your games. Just tell the fucking truth for once in your life. Okay, okay. I'll confess, to everything. [panting] Yes, finally. Thank you. All right, just don't hurt me, please. I won't, okay, here we go. All right, I want you to look straight in the camera and when I tell you to, start talking. Well, wait, aren't you gonna take me to the police station? Oh, yeah, so you can just start lying to the cops the second you walk through the door? [Harris laughs] No, Riley, it has to be like this. What do you want me to say? Don't be difficult, Riley. I'm not, I just, I'm, I'm nervous and I don't want to miss anything, okay? Fine. Tell them about how we first met. Tell them how you hounded me incessantly, how you stalked me, and then when you discovered that we weren't gonna be together forever, how you took your revenge. You hacked into my Twitter account, you got me fired, and then, and this is the most important part, tell them how you somehow remotely downloaded five gigs of child pornography onto my computer, which could get me sent to prison for half a decade. Harris, I. Okay, I'll. I'll say all of that. Thank you. Are you ready? [Riley] Yeah. Great. Go ahead. - Wait. - What? What, Riley? For fuck's sake, I know this is gonna be hard on you, just, you don't really have a choice. I want to confess to everything. [panting] It's just, this won't work. Why? Why the fuck not? Because look at me, Harris, I'm a crying mess and I'm tied to a chair. It looks like I'm, like I'm kidnapped. Can't do anything about that. - [Riley] You could untie me. - I don't think so. Wait, just listen. You could untie me and I could wash up in the bathroom and then I could film the video, I could, I could make, like, an Instagram video where I'm bragging about how I screwed up your life and then, and then you could show that to the cops and I'll, I'll confess to everything at the police station and it'll seem totally real, you know? Why? Why would you do that? Because, you got me. You won. I give up. You're just clever. This is exactly the kind of clever shit you pulled on me. It's a gift, I guess. Fine. There's a bathroom attached to the stage. It'll work, I swear. Riley, don't try a fucking thing. I want you to tell me what you're gonna say. Anything you want. Can you get me some paper towels please? Should talk about how, should talk about how stupid I am, how you tricked me, but don't use my name, it can't feel staged. Okay, got it. I think I'm ready. Shit. My hands are so wet. Can I have another paper towel? Oh. [Riley grunts] [grunting, shrieking] [sputtering] [dramatic music] [Riley shrieks] [coughing] Goddammit! Fuckin' bitch! Goddammit. Riley! Riley, where the fuck are you? God. [panting] Riley! [panting] Riley! [panting] [Riley screaming] [Harris grunting] You think you can get away from me that easy, you crazy bitch? Huh? Goddammit. [grunting] You call me crazy. [grunting, shrieking] [panting] [whimpering] Hello? Help! [whimpering] Help me! [grunting] Help! [shrieking] Hello! Help, please! Please! [panting] [gasps] [tense music] You stabbed me. [labored breathing] Riley. Why didn't you just confess? [phone vibrating and ringing] Hello? [Ronald] Jesus Christ, Harris. I've been trying to reach you all night. It's Ronald Dale, your lawyer. Where the hell have you been? Huh? [Ronald] Uh-oh, are you drunk? Harris, listen to me very carefully. You're off the hook. [Harris] What? [Ronald] Yeah, you were right, sort of. Turns out you were hacked, but not by that girl. By some 15-year-old kid named Keenan. Gil Keenan from Colorado Springs. - Heard of him? - [Harris] Keenan? [Ronald] Yeah, you probably know him from his online name, ShadowMan. Apparently you mocked him on some video game. Can you believe that? His mom caught him, made him 'fess up to everything. I got the call yesterday and I've been trying to call you ever since. You're off the hook, Harris, you're a free man. Go celebrate! Hello? Harris? Are you there? Hello? Hey, you. What are you doing out here? Jesus, what the hell happened? Holy fuckin' Christ. Get your hands where I can see 'em, now! I need backup at 3421 Empire Boulevard. Got a maniac here. He killed some poor girl. [soft music] ♫ I was drifting ♫ Into dreaming ♫ And I saw something ♫ I hadn't seen before ♫ Two young ladies ♫ I hadn't seen since high school ♫ Holding a piece of me ♫ Inside a plastic jar ♫ And there was a hook attached to it ♫ And they were attached at the hip ♫ I was driving on vacation ♫ And I saw something ♫ I hadn't seen in years ♫ The man was seizing ♫ On the pavement flailing ♫ And I did nothing ♫ A white-dressed woman carried him off ♫ I didn't lift a finger ♫ I didn't stop my car ♫ I just kept on driving ♫ I didn't help that man at all ♫ And I hope he forgives me.
