A child? And how old is he? Is none of your business. - What does he do? Is none of your business. - I'm fine. You are 17, I am responsible for you. Since when? You're just doing that. In front of grandma. You do not care about anything. You're leaving and leaves me behind. Listen to me. I had at 17 the first time sex. I understand you. I understand you very well. I do not want, that you are making nonsense. Just like you? It is not about me. You are young. He is too old for you. We do not marry. Justine. Let's talk. We are not enemies. Leave me alone. - We are not enemies. Claude here. Leave a Message, I'm on my way. Come back, Claude. Do not stay away. What do you think, Claude? Oh, stop it. You can never be objective with me. I can not pretend like it's not good. Can not you? That does not help me. Be critical. I'm critical, Katia. What's wrong with you? If it's good, it's good. - Good. Give me a glass of wine. That will relax me. To you, Katia, wherever you are. Marion, let me in. Marion, I have to talk to you. Hello. I am Claude. Is Marion there? No. I thought you were older. Should I align something?

I break everything. But I'm scared. Of what? - Before you. Before me? - Yes, in front of you and me. Before what can happen. I thought, I would never fall in love again. And you? That's fine. We can stay friends. Claude. Look at me. Everything OK? I do not know. Katia. Claude, what happened? Everything OK? All right. Nothing else, just a nightmare. There you are. I forgot my math book. I had breakfast at the cafÃ©. Did you eat something? Would you like some tea? You're weird. I'm not. I have no time. I have to get ready. Did not you sleep here? But. Naturally. Who were you with? Anyone. What is wrong with you? You were with Simon. If you have to know it, Yes. For the wanker did you leave dad? He is not a wanker, you do not even know him. He's after all the girls. I do not want to marry him. Do you have your math book? Quick, we'll be late. Would a kiss encourage you? Will you never be satisfied? I will not envy you. Your resistance decreases. I only want one word. May I help you? Say, Knight, I worship you. Knight, I adore you. No wait. Not so fast. You seduce her. You have to kiss her for a kiss enchant. Do you understand? Again please. says: Knight, I adore you. Knight, I adore you. Do not be so childish. That was good. Do you understand how it works? Sorry, that means: I will not envy you? Does anyone know that? You still have sex? It's not that easy. She just can not love a woman. Like the title La Surprise de l'Amour suggests is not that clear from the beginning. This is La Fausse Suivante. Yes of course. In Marivaux 'piece Love is always a fight. As in life. A fight between desire and the rejection of him. When the desire is stronger, it gets complicated. But... Maybe that's better. Excuse me. That I do not understand. Neither do I. Never mind, carry on. - The hour is over. Then you can go. Stop it. Pull yourself together. Will you come to me? I make risotto. No, I can not today. I want you. - Listen, Simon. I just want a friendship. I'd rather tell you quite openly. I do not want to use you. Louise. I'm in love. That's why I did not hear anything from you. Who is it? Do I know him? Yes, you know her. "You"? You are in love with a woman? Yes. It was also surprising for me. It feels like I am to live the life of someone else. Everything is turning. It is nice. I'm completely baffled. I never expected that. I'm happy, Louise. Happy. Who is she? Guess what. Claude? And I introduced you. Stop it. I'm glad about that. I do not understand that. Not really. My sister, in love with a woman. We have to tell Mama. As? Are you crazy? Wait. - It was just a joke. Goodbye. - Thank you. Are you following me? I saw a beautiful woman. Thought: wait, this is my wife. I know. You like me from afar. I can not live without you. I have to go, Paul. Are you in love? Why do you ask this? It is obvious. Only love can cause such a radiation. Do I know him? You left me for someone I always came back. And you? That's enough. I'm in a hurry. To meet him? Who is it? I'll tell you who I slept with when we were together. You will never change. - Who is it? Another teacher? One of my friends? Who is it? It is a woman. What? I do not believe that. Introduce me. We could do a threesome. Bye for now. See you soon, Marion. Stop, you two. What's happening? Smooch with Patrick, if you are bored. Justine. Justine. A yellow car. Yes, that is him. Excuse me. Stop. Not. Snout. Snout. Snout. Quick, let's go. That's nice. I like being here. Careful, Marion. I am dangerous. Really? Dangerous? Do you know the story of Bluebeard? You had seven women in front of me? I am the eighth? Where are the bodies? Search for them. Are you scared? Nothing. Look under the bed. Let me in. - No, you can not get me. In the end, yes. - no. But. - no. Now you can not leave. You are my last love. What the... - Exciting, huh? Stop, that hurts. Au. You do not like it? Stop it. Stop it, you're scaring me. You should be scared. Tell me about Katia. What? Katia. Your Katia. Do you love her? Yes. Why do not you go to her? I will not see her again. It's over. It does not look that way. Marion? I'm jealous. I was never jealous on a man, but you ... How do you know each other? Why did I separate you? Tell me. I have to know it. Why are you so cold to me? Do not you care? Do not start a discussion. We are not married. You call her name, if you sleep. Even when you are awake. If you go now, it is over. Do you hear? It's over. Hello. Do you have a reservation? - Yes, Chalin. A table for three. This way please.

Hello, what are you doing here? Everything OK? Have a look, I got it for free. You are wonderful. Congratulations. Hello. I did not know, that you are accompanied. I have the table you are looking for. Another time. Have a drink with us. I have to go, kid. Bye for now. Well then. Did you catch something? - Not yet. Is what? I do not cheat on you. Katia died two years ago. It's not a scam to love her. I do not cheat on you. Since then I have nobody looked at. Do you remember at our first meeting? You said that ... It was like out to wake up a deep sleep. Thats how I feel too. Let me sleep here. Justine is not coming. She may come tomorrow morning, to have breakfast with me. Then come with me. No, she should not know that I sleep somewhere else. You are not her daughter. That's not what it is about. I want my own apartment. I want this apartment becomes completely mine. I have just leave my husband. I have to live alone. I thought you wanted that, too. No, I do not want that. I miss you permanently. I hate it, when you are not here. I need to see you, smell, touch, breathe ... Even if we do not sleeping together. You are there, that's enough. I want to wake up next to you. That's too fast. I never loved a woman. I feel like a mutant. It is so big. I do not want, Justine knows. I can not tell her. Fire. It is over? - Yes. Are you sure? - Yes. What happened? You have started the stove. Do you mean?

Hello. Leave my wife alone. They keep her away from me. You are just an episode, do you know that? The faster this is over, the better. That also applies to you. I am an episode? Well said. What are you then? A youthful sin? Listen to me. Stay away. The camp is private terrain. Roger that? Roger that. Disappear now. Or I'll get the police. Did you still have sex? - That does not concern you. Tell me. Not very often. And how was it? - Not bad. How "not bad"? - Well, not bad. So that's how...? Or rather ...? That was it? - Where do you want to get that from? I was married. Clean up the things. A sip of wine? Yes. Do you think that's possible? - Yes. Are you opening the bottle? - Yes. We have no dessert. Not bad. She does not like biscuits anyway. A Sunday without cake ... Oh shit. What happened? - That's a blot. May I have it what to borrow from you? Do you give me a present? Claude. What's happening? Do not touch me. What's happening? - Pull it out. Pull it out. I'm sorry. It was a fight for nothing. Really stupid. But we could not stop. It escalated. It was a beautiful day, I opened the window ... She was sitting on the ledge ... She was foaming with rage, because I did not give in. One moment she was sitting, not in the next. A blink of an eye and she was gone. I could not hold her. Or do something. I could not do anything. Did she fall? Or jumped? - I dont know. She was mad at me. Maybe she jumped, to punish me. She did not want to die. When the window only to have been. Mummy? Claude? Hello Justine. Are they for me? Thank you. Hello Little. - Sit down. Everything OK? It does not work that way.
