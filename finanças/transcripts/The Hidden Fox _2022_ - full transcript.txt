[English subtitles are available] Legend has it that in the land of extreme cold, there are countless treasures buried. And the secret of the treasures is hidden in the iron box, guarded by the martial arts master Hu Yidao. Only Miao Renfeng can rival him in the world. The self-appointed king Tian Guinong longs for the treasures, but is afraid of Hu Yidao. The Evils under him then offered a plan to lure Miao Renfeng to come out and fight with Hu Yidao. On that day, the Evils gathered in the snowy mountains to set up a killing game. [The Hidden Fox] Shopkeeper, my sword is blunt. Please polish it. Write your name in the ledger. [Hu Yidao] Come fetch it tomorrow. Will it take that long? Good sword of course takes more time. Mrs. Miao. Isn't Warrior Miao home? I want you to do me a favor. Will it be recognized? My imitation of the word is perfect. [Hu Yidao] Warrior Miao. Hu Yidao send it here. [Miao Renfeng] [[Let's fight at the foot of the snowy mountain, so that people will know who is the world's best.] [Hu Yidao] Warrior Miao. Why are you so hell-bent on killing me? Not only you. Today, I the whole Hu's Village to sacrifice to my wife. All right. Since you said so, I don't need to explain anymore. Bohun upas. The sword is poisoned. Hu Yidao. Miao Renfeng. Your time has come. Whyï¼Ÿ You know nothing even when you are dying. Dumbass. Who ordered to slaughter the whole village? I did. The village is not big. The iron box can be found. Tao. There're so many living people in the village. We couldn't help. Tao. The iron box is not in the village. The iron box is lost. You go back and report to Official Tian by yourselves. Search. Yes. Over there. Hurry up. Hurry up. The iron box is nowhere to be found since then. Over the past ten years, the villains led by Tian Guinong never stopped looking for it until one day it reappeared in the martial arts community. [Ten Years Later] Good. Drink less. We are approaching Tian Guinong's territory. The subordinates of his are not easy going. The Eight Villains. It's said that the Rakshasa will also avoid them. But I want to confront them. You are drunk. Stop talking nonsense. This escort is extraordinary. Let's go. Where're you rogues from? You dare to mess with my men. You are asking for death. Senior. How come you are here? To look for food. Do you know what food in this world is the most delicious? This pair of ears is mine. Qing Wen. You broke the rules. We've been looking for this iron box for ten years. Whoever has it now will get credit. That's the rule. Little coquette. After following Bao Shu for several years, you have become reckless. Gui Yu. The thing is not here. Giddyap. I've been following this clue for a whole year. The thing is definitely among the escorted cargo. Qing Wen really came at a good time. Now the thing is gone. You told me it has nothing to do with you. Definitely. Everytime you said so. Where's the thing? It's nowhere to be found. I think you are getting more confused with age. You'd better retire earlier and give up your position. Otherwise, at this rate, we won't be able to see the treasures by the time you die. Bao Shu. You've been more and more reckless when talking to me. I was just being straight. Official Tian. Gui Yu requests to meet you. Send him here. Present it. Master. I've found the thing. Official Tian. Go get others. Whoever recovers the treasure first will be a duke for generations. Feihu Mountain. Let's go. Giddyap. [The First Day] Dear guests, are you staying for a meal or accommodation? Tao Baisui. We're already here. Why not show us the thing in the iron box? Official Tian sent us to this mountain together. We three know nothing. Isn't it unfair? I know the three of you don't believe me. But the thing was found by Gui Yu. It should be kept by me. You're really coming for treasure hunting. Official Tian is an overlord in the north. If he gets the treasures, the world will be in chaos. Don't blame me for being nagging. You won't be able to find the treasures based only on a map. I think you should go back. Feihu Mountain is not a good place to go. Old man. You meant something else. Feihu Mountain is the Hidden Fox's territory. I've been around here for years. I've never seen anyone out alive. It's said the Hidden Fox was transformed from the ghost of Hu Yidao. It can conjure up clouds that cover the sky. Lord Tao, have you heard about that the Hidden Fox only kills villains. Only kills villains? Then how come you are still alive? -Lord Tao. -Old man. What are you doing? You want to kill your peers? Hand over the key. What key? Didn't you say it's useless to have just the map? To excavate the treasure, we still need a key. It's marked on the map that the key is in this inn. You planned well. I... I really don't know anything about the key. Since you know who I am, you should know my capability. You should also know you can't stop me. Tao Baisui. If you kill him, where can we find the key? Go find the key. The map is in our hands. We mustn't allow Bao Shu to get the key to put limits on us. Let's go. Let's split. Sexagenary Cycle Lock. Junior. We found the key. Senior. After finding the treasures, what do you plan to do? After Master achieve first-class merit and is made a duke, our power will be much stronger. By then, I must taste all delicious food in the world. Senior, you don't think villains will get retribution, do you? [Yin Ji, One of Eight Villains, Died] [Five Years Ago] Hurry up. Hurry up. Hurry up. Kneel. Stop looking. Get to work! Get to work! Stop. Hand it over. Hand it over. You know what would happen if you didn't follow the rules. If it hadn't been for my help, you would have been dead long ago. Even you dared to steal my stuff. After a day of work, if we dig out gold, we can get some rice. If we can't, we'll be whipped. There's no more gold in this mountain. I'm gonna die anyway. You son of a gun! Who gave you the name Gui Yu? Who are you? I've been looking for you for a long time. There's a flow of energy in your body. You're smart. My adoptive father needs someone to help him. I thought it could be an opportunity. Who's your adoptive father? Bao Shu. Have you heard of this name? You villains made people on the north border suffer. You made me end up like this. I'd rather die than work for him. It's easy to die. You can die right away without doing anything. I just thought you're worth more than nothing. You can only get opportunities when you're alive. Think about your dead parents. What would they want you to do? Who are you? You have to make a decision now. I'm gonna go with you. Gui Yu has progressed a lot this year. He's more talented than I expected. Once upon a time, there was a hunter who found a baby tiger in a cave. that he liked so much. He was so happy that he took the baby tiger back home. The baby tiger behaved so well. It grew up little by little and took the place of the hound. The hunter was happy but also worried whether the baby tiger would catch himself in the end. Even you are afraid of a tiger? I'm afraid that the tiger is not cruel enough. Kill Qing Wen. Qing Wen once helped you. Killing her is paying back evil for good. Not killing her is being disloyal. Do you think you can be a real villain with what you've got? Get over there. Cure him and take him to Tao Baisui. It hit home. Exactly on target. You're questioning me. The owner is dead. There are only our own people. It was Gui Yu who found him. He had been dead when I found him. I didn't see anyone else. It's a shame that your apprentice was killed. However, I've found the key. Shall we keep looking for the treasures? Of course. We'll go to the mountains tomorrow. A secret weapon. I don't believe Yin Ji would have been killed by this little trick. Take care of yourselves. Gui Yu, stay here. Master. How long have you been with me? Four years. Do you think your senior could get rid of this trick with his kung fu? I don't know. But I do doubt the cause of his death. The owner once mentioned something about the Hidden Fox. I'm not sure whether he has something to do with this. The Hidden Fox? There are rumours about him. Do you believe the rumours? I'm not sure about that. Now Bao Shu has got the key. We've lost one more person. I don't know what we should do now. It must be you who should take the credit. Let's find an opportunity to get back the key. All of us have our own unique skills except you. Bao Shu and I have been at peace with each other for all those years because we're all afraid of the other's unique skills. Go get some rest. Yes. [An Hour Ago] I heard noises. Senior! Nice trick. Right on time. I learned that from Yin Ji. What did Tao Baisui tell you just now? He said you two don't fight each other because of your unique skills. But it's different this time. He asked me to get prepared for the fight. I thought he's planning to get the key from you. Is he? Don't worry. I'm good at hiding my identity. Then hurry up. Who's got the map now? Zhou Yunyang. Kill him. Help me get the map. Zhou Yunyan is very sensitive. He's not as easy as Yin Ji to deal with. I don't know his unique skills either. Since when can the hound negotiate with the hunter? This is what my father gave me. It blesses you. I was the one who asked you to join. I'll let you live no matter what happens. [The Second Day] Let's get through the woods first. If we get lost, we just walk towards the sun. Tao, there's something wrong with the woods. It's an illusion. Gui Yu. Zhou Yunyang. Gui Yu. Sanniang. Zhou Yunyang. Zheng Sanniang. Sanniang. Zhou Yunyang. Sanniang. Sanniang. Zhou Yunyang. Zhou Yunyang. Zhou Yunyang. Gui Yu. Where are others? Did you see them? No. It's weird. Why can't we get out of the woods? Because you walked in at the wrong time. The fog is the thickest in the woods every morning. Illusions are everywhere. It's like a maze. You can't get out of here with only a map. After this period of time, it'll be rather easy to get out of the woods. How do you know that? The fog will be gone soon. I need to hurry up. It was really you who killed Yin Ji. Why did you kill him? Give me the map so we can both live. I don't think you can live. Interesting. You killed Yin Ji? That's what you've got? Bring it on. You brat. Come over. Why are you scared? Come on. Is this your unique skill, icing? Water is my secret weapon. No one is living who ever saw this skill. Is that so? There's no alcohol in your kettle, right? Zhou Yunyang is dead. I've got this map at the expense of my life. Go. I'm poisoned by Zhou Yunyang. I can't live more than four hours. Only Tao Baisui has the antidote. Really? Go ask him for it. What do you mean? I just killed Zhou Yunyang. You asked me to go to him. Do you want me to be killed by him? Father. Is it the right way? It should be here. Gui Yu. What's wrong with this map? Gui Yu. Gui Yu. What are you doing? My plan did not work out, but I have to be alive. Gui Yu wants to take back the key, being alive. It is impossible. A quarrel which benefits only a third party. We just wait to see what will happen. [An hour ago] My apprentice, it's absolutely you. You do think you can play tricks on me. When did you start to be suspicious of me? The bamboo cup was overturned negligently by you when you deployed your scheme, is that right? I don't have children. I have always taken you and Yin Ji as my biological sons. Now, I've lost my two sons. How do you pay for that? Since I was caught by you, I have nothing to say. But all the tricks are designed by Bao Shu. From the very beginning, he has not thought about seeking treasure with you. He wants to kill you all. When was you bought over? He didn't buy over me. From the beginning, I was with him. These years, your actions, all have been observed by him. Have he? You can kill me, but now, you have the map while he has the key. There is no advantage for you two. Either both of you can not find the treasure, or one kill the other, leaving nobody alive. Keep me alive because I'm still helpful. It is said that if the knife stabs into eyes, people will not die at the moment. Today, let me have a try. Wait. Force his mouth to be open. The poison will attack in two hours. After that, you are bound to die. Now here's a chance for you. You give the fake map to Bao Shu, and you return with his key for the cure. They are inseparable. How can I take actions? Haven't you been good at hiding? Where is the destination of the map? [Hyena Valley] Gui Yu. Bao Shu. No. Something happens. He's dead. Where is the key? It is been taken away. What a good-for-nothing you are! Where is he? Be careful. The key is with them. Let's take actions separately. Kill them all. If you kill Sai and Qing Wen, you can keep your life. Sai, hiding away is not the way you are. Are you afraid of my spellweaving? Are you? You broke my arms 10 years ago. Today, I will break your neck. I did not give up my arm, which was articulated by the witch doctor. I have been working it out for 10 years. It is especially for you. Tao, show your spellweaving. Today, at least, one of us will die. It is out of my surprise that these 10 years you have made great progess. Fine. If you want to die, I will let you. Watch out carefully. One blink, you'll die. Tao Baisui. Are you looking for the key? Here it is. Why? Bao Shu is dead. Why have you betrayed me? Who has put you up to it on earth? Answer me. I can't because you questioned wrongly. [Sai Zongguan and Tao Baisui, Two of Eight Evils, Died] Qing Wen, What Tao Baisui means is the death of you. Take out the key. I'll kill you fast. The key is not with me. Turn around. It's hard to be born with this beautiful face. What a pity if you die like this. If I do as you want, can you keep me alive? What do you think? I never wanted to oppose you. It's just that if I didn't follow Bao Shu, I am already dead. Now Bao Shu is dead. I am at your beck and call just as Gui Yu. At my beck and call? Let me have fun. I will keep you alive. You taste so sweet. Then, my life is given to you. Brother Yunyang, you are so impatient to do it. About my spellweaving, you haven't asked once. A pack of hyenas fell back all of a sudden. Wouldn't you be curious? I'm weak in power. These fireworms can't be exposed in the light. They are less poisonous. They can just make people lose their consciousness temporarily. Look, you can even move your fingers. [Zhou Yunyang, One of Eight Evils, Died] You little coquette. You are so seductively charming. No man can refrain himself from your spellweaving. Sanniang have been here since then. Yes. I'm watching. Why didn't you save Brother Yunyang, I was so absorbed into it that I forget to save him. Zhou Yunyang said you are sweet. But he had not said such words to me. I still want to taste how sweet you are. You just said Zhou Yunyang was careless. No wonder he was killed by you. Look at your face. Such a dewy face. It's beautiful. But you little poisonous bug cannot escape my net. You little coquette. I would have thought about giving you a fast kill. I knew you can't be trusted. It turned out you have affair with the girl. I'll kill you both. The first-class merit belongs to me and Tao. Tao Baisui is already dead. Sai Zongguan is dead as well. That is to say, the first-class merit belongs to me. Sanniang thinks evil will never be recompensed with evil? How could I know? I'm not the evil. Tao Baisui said that each of the eight has spellweaving of their own. Except me. He was wrong. Are you familiar with the technique of using the sword? Who are you? The Hidden Fox. Kill bad people specially. Didn't you hear about it? Do you know why you just cannot find the iron box in the past 10 years? Because I've always had it. It's me who guided you up the mountain on purpose and let you fight each other. We are guards on the journey. Need to fire it up. We are here to spend the night. The highest merit must belong to master. Let's find a chance to get the key back. Let me make full preparation for the action. I thought he wanted to snatch the key in your hands. But everything was designed by Bao Shu. He intended to kill everyone of you. Save my life. I'm still usefull. Where is the key? Snatched. Trash. Are you looking for the key? It's here in my hands. Who are you? I'm Hu Fei, son of Hu Yidao. Remember this name. [Zheng Sanniang, One of Eight Evils, Died] It's over. Is it over? A centipede does not topple over even dead. Kid, you are exposed. I didn't think Hu Yidao had a son. I just cherished a snake in my bosom. But he hid you not because he wanted you to come for your death from me. He wanted you to live like a dog. Right? Hu Fei. Shut up. Your kungfu was all taught by me. Every move of you was seen clearly by me. Don't you remember I'm your father? Shut up! My father is Hu Yidao! Your technique of using sword is not even half of Hu Yidao's. A top master just gave birth to a waste like you. He could not die in peace. As your father, I will teach you one last move. Win from real danger. Die and live later. Learn it. Qing Wen. You lied to me. For all these years. You have been lying to me. Do you even want to kill me as well? My father, my mother, and the enormous revenge of the whole Hu Village. I cannot take the revenge. For all these years, I have been living like a dog. I just intended to live. But you just found me. From that moment, I knew this was a chance given by the God. You cannot blame me. I will kill you. I will kill you. The stuff is in his hands. Wait. Qing Wen. I was tricked and put you in danger. Please kill me. Leave. Why is here nothing? Where's the treasure? Qian is the heaven. Kan is the water. The red gas caused it. Qian is the heaven. Kan is the water. The red gas caused it. At midnight, in the northeast, there will be the entrance. There will be the entrance. Go find it quickly. Qing Wen. Qing Wen. There is no entrance here. The treasure is frozen by the firm ice. If you really want to break the ice by force, you must fall to the abyss with it. This is the only way to get the treasure. How did you know it? I came here before. Qing Wen. Are you crazy? My daughter. There is poison on the blade. Bohun upas. Do you still remember this poison? You followed me so many years. And you want to kill me with my poison. He's come. You... You are still alive. Win from real danger. Die and live later. I learned it. Hu Fei. Qing Wen. Without this, I will see how you can come back to life. Bastard. You two bastards. I will kill you. Kill you! Why? Why? Qing Wen. Why do you even betray me? You are about to die and you know nothing. Idiot. Who gave you the name Gui Yu? I've been searching for you for a long time. Who are you? I'm Miao Ruolan, daughter of Miao Renfeng. Guide them up the mountain and attack them one by one. This is our only chance. The key and the map. We cannot let one of them have both at the same time. [Inn] My father gave this to me. It can protect you safe. You came because of me. No matter what happens, I have to let you live. The plan has changed. Be careful. Qing Wen. Leave. Swap the cure with the key. Save yourself first. They still have four left. We have to take a risky move. Promise me. Live till the end. Let's go. Do you even want to kill me as well? This was a chance given by the God. You cannot blame me. I will kill you! I will kill you! The treasure is yours. [Bao Shu, One of Eight Evils, Died] [The 30th Day] There's no need. Allow Gui Yu to enter the palace with the blade. You found the treasure first? Yes. There are numerous treasures. You can get it any time. It's just a small part in the box. For you to admire. You are indeed a teenager hero. [End]
