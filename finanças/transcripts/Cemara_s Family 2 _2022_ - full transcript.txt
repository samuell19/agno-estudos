ADAPTED FROM THE LEGENDARY TV SERIES "KELUARGA CEMARA" BY ARSWENDO ATMOWILOTO Please remember that. Now, you're in charge of this place. Okay? To help your mobilization, we will provide a company car for you. I'm afraid I have to go now. Don't forget. If you need any help, you can get in touch with Mr. Ujang. - Count those three. - Yes. - That's it. - The one wearing the green vest and orange gloves. Don't mistake him for a Dutch goalkeeper. - Yeah. - Well, I'll be going now. - Thank you very much. - Okay. Take care. - Thank you very much. - You're welcome. Right. We must take care of our health. - Please take care of your health too. - Right. Remember, this farm, all these cages, are just like your own home. - Yes. - Excuse me. - Yes, take care. - See you. Ara, I will be working here from now on. It will be difficult for me to take turns with Euis to pick you up from school. She's busy these days. So it would be better if you learn to go home by yourself. Don't worry. I will go home with Euis. That's her promise. I won't bother you. When we get home, I'll remind Euis again, so we won't bother you. - Arabah! - Arabah! If that's the case, you can tell her. No worries! CV. UNGGAS MANDIRI - CHICKEN FARM Ara! What is that voice? What voice? Didn't you hear it? I didn't hear anything. Hey, Ara! Wear this. Do you have to work here? This place is haunted. What do you mean "haunted"? You know very well I'm scarier than any ghost. Ara, hold this. - Come on. I'm serious, you know. - It's true. I'm also serious, Ara. - Ara! - See? The voice is back. What voice? Did you really not hear it? No, I didn't hear anything. Hey, come on! Hold on, okay? Okay. Ready? - Ready. - Let's go! So, you'll be working here? You don't need to deliver eggs to the market anymore? You'll stop with the online taxi driver job? Right. I will take care of the chickens and everything. I will start working here. - Andi! - Rindu, please. - Den, stop! - Wait. - Rindu, please. - It's Andi, miss. What are you doing? Just get back to work. We need to finish this. Stop it. Come on. Give me the chunks of meat. Gosh. Mr. Aa, don't be stingy. I haven't eaten in so long. - How come? - It's an IV drip. You little... Come on. Hurry. What was that earlier? I wanted to give the paper... I see. So, Rindu the class president and the so-called loyal friend turned out to be a traitor. I should've known better. Euis, you misunderstood! Deni, you're unpredictable. Hey, stop it. So? The sales are not going so well. I'm not sure. Agil, just a minute. Wait a moment. I don't know how to say it. Look, your sister is here. Mom, Euis is home. Euis, please play with Agil. I don't think I can continue. I'm afraid it won't sell. I'll just take it. If it doesn't sell well, I can return them. - Yeah. - We have 57 here. I'll take two for my kids. Sure, take it. Thank you. Well, we need to go. Okay, thank you. You're welcome. Me too. See you. Bye. Bye, Agil. You want to open it? Euis. You really can't go home with Ara anymore? Actually, I have a lot of extra activities now. There has been a lot of group work too. That's why I can't always go home on time like before. After all, Ara is old enough to go home by herself. But it will make her sad, you know. You promised to go home with her. That was when I was still in middle school. I wasn't this busy. I see. Then, you need to talk to Ara. Don't bother your father by asking him to pick her up because you can't. It doesn't sell well. People won't buy opak anymore. Do you want to try selling opak online? I can help take the pictures if you want. - Would anyone want to buy it? - Hurry up! Watch out! - I've seen people do that. - Watch out! I will ask Auntie Salmah. I want more. Hey. I'm sorry I haven't been coming here lately. You want some? It smells good. Euis? Hey. I found a way out for our business. What do you mean by "a way out"? So, I met an old friend of mine. I haven't seen him for so long that I forgot him. He used to be poor, but now he's rich. He looks really cool. He sold his land and started a catfish business. I wonder how some people can make a fortune overnight when we are trying our best to survive. Right? So, he wants to lend us money to fund our business. Is it true? How will we pay it back? He said we shouldn't worry. We can use the money. Who would lend money for free? Some people would. Who? The person I mentioned. I just told you. Didn't you listen? Anyway, you don't have to worry about it, okay? Just leave it to me. It's hard if we only sell opak. Just take it. I'm home. - Ara too. - You're here. Mom, we didn't sell much. Auntie Salmah, have you been here long? Yeah. Dear, how was it? Dear, I now have a new job. Thank God. Starting tomorrow, I will work at the farm. Dear. But the farm is safe, right? At first, I was worried, but when I got there, the place was being sterilized. Mom. They said they will give him a car. - So we will have a car again. - It's a company car. I will have to travel extensively with a lot of chickens, so they will provide a company car. But I don't like Dad's new workplace. Why is that? Because ghosts live there. Really? Where are the ghosts? I will fight it. I'm serious. I'm not lying. Why did Ara say the farm is haunted? - So... - Because I heard a voice calling me. But we could only see chickens there, right? Right, only chickens. Could it be the chickens? It's scary. Strange. Maybe you heard it wrong, Ara. Really, I'm not lying. The farm where I'll be working is not a dark, scary place. It's bright, neat, and clean. I don't know why Ara said that. Hey, Agil. I'm home. You didn't greet me? Don't you want to play with me? She's cooking. Give me some of the food, will you? Euis, but it's true, that place is haunted. I don't think it was the chickens calling me. I didn't hear it wrong. It sounded like a chicken. It's impossible for the chickens to call me, right? Ara, why are you using that comb? I'm still using it. Give it back! Just use the other one. I like using this comb. We have another comb. Who are you texting? Is it your friend, Ima? Euis, do you want to listen to my new song? Ara, why did you put the towel there? Give the comb back! Why are you so cranky today? Who's cranky? Just give me the comb. Take the towel, Ra! We only have one left? It's all my fault that we barely have any savings left. It's okay. I'm grateful we managed to survive until now. It means we have to start again from the beginning. Thank you for staying strong, dear. - You're coughing. - Here. Have a drink. Ara. Starting tomorrow, you can go home alone, okay? I can't pick you up anymore. I have a lot of activities at school, so I can't always go home on time. That's why you need to start to go home alone, okay? How could you do that? You promised to always go home with me. I always kept my promises to you. Why did you break yours? I know, but it was in the past. I wasn't so busy then. And it's a good thing if you learn to go home alone like the other kids. That doesn't mean we won't pick you up at all. But if I have time or if your sister is not busy, we'll definitely pick you up. Okay? I also want a separate room, Dad. Why are you so mean to me? I've always been good to you. Ara is sad already because she can't go home with you. And now you ask for separate rooms. Is that necessary? It's not like we have to do it, Mom. It's just that I want my privacy. Moving rooms is not that easy. Where will Ara sleep? Should she sleep with Dad and I? You know we have Agil. I miss having my own room. Having my own stuff. I don't want to share with Ara all the time. Okay, if that's what you want. But give us some time, okay? Cleaning the room takes time. We need money too. Well, if you and Dad think the other room isn't decent, let me use that room. Ara can stay here. Okay, then. Let's see what we can do. Mister! Mister! Ara! Where is your father, Ra? He went out. He said you can wait. Mom and Euis are in the room. Why the long face? Nothing. Mr. Romli, do you believe that ghosts are real? Where's the ghost, Ra? The thing is, at the chicken farm, I heard a voice calling me. We know that there are only chickens there. It couldn't be the chickens, right? Well, it could be the chickens. What? Is it possible? Yes. When I was your age, I could talk to frogs. Maybe the chickens knew that you wanted to talk to them. That's why they called you. Right? You're right. I also wanted to talk to the chickens. See? How come you could talk to frogs? Well, do you remember? - What? - That one. The intersection near the complex of big houses. Yes. When I was your age, there was a pond. There were a lot of frogs. Like a whole family of frogs? A whole family. And you could talk to them? Yes. Every day after school, I went there and played with them, so I could understand their language. But among the four frogs, there was one frog that was the biggest and the fattest. So it couldn't hop? It could. Who said it couldn't hop? The big frog was the best at hopping. It was awesome, because the bigger the frog, it would... It looked like this. It pushed itself, and... Like that! Like, very big? - Very big. - How big? - This big? - About this big. Agil, do you want to sleep? Sleep with me. Dear, please find some time tomorrow to clean Ara's room. Okay, I will find the time. Poor kid. She was so shocked. It's okay. She is a big girl. She'll get over it tomorrow. If Agil can't sleep, can you take care of her? It's your turn. I know, but tomorrow, I must get up early. I have to go to the farm at 6:00. It's the first day of work. Okay? Agil, let's sleep. She's still playing. Come on. Just make up already. It's been two days since you ignored each other. Moss will start growing on both of you at this rate. You'll turn green. Gross! Do you want that? You don't want that, right? So, let's make up. Do you really not like Deni? I swear, Euis. And if I liked someone, it would not be Deni. She's right. She likes our senior... He's here. Come here. Loot at him. Over here. CAHAYA CISARUA ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - I'll be going now. Bye. - Bye. Just a moment. This way. Are you ready? Yes. I'm ready. Let's check it out, okay? This is your room. Look. This is your room now. On Saturday, when I have my day off, I'll fix the room. Okay? Try it. Try to sleep on it. You can use it already. Try to sleep on it. I made the bed for you. See you, Euis. - Me too. Take care. - Take care. - Bye. - Bye. Why are you following me? Nothing. So? Say something. Don't be silent. I want to apologize. I really wanted to ask for Rindu's help, to say... To say what? To say that... I actually like you. She told me about it. So? I forgave you. So? So? What do you want now that you've been forgiven? Can I ask you to take me home? What? I mean... Can I walk you home? Sure. So, where are you now? Ara and I are in separate rooms now. No need to whisper anymore. Wait a minute. What? Euis have changed. I don't like it. - I like the green one. - Look. Here's yours. Only 10,000 for one chick. You want it? No? Only 10,000. You've been going home alone lately? Yes. Do you want to go home together? Sure. Hey, stop. Why? The little chicken is lost. Are you lost? You can talk to chickens? Mr. Romli said I can train it. I will take you home, okay? No! It must belong to someone. What if we just count to 100? If no one comes after that, we should take it home. Let's start. One, two, three... Not that fast! One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten... Wait, okay? Just wait, little chick. What is this? The heart? No feather here. Just wait, okay? That chicken must belong to someone. We waited for the owner, but no one came. Alright. Then, go change your clothes. You can't play in your uniform. Gosh! Mom, Ara has a chicken! Gross! The chicken is dirty! What are you doing with the chicken? Come here. Ask it if we should pick the chayote now. Okay. It turned blue. Can we pick the chayote now? What did it say? Nothing. I cleaned it with antibacterial soap. It's okay. I'll give it a bath again to clean it some more. We don't know if the chicken carries any disease or not. It could be dangerous. But I've cleaned it. I know, Ara. It's called a neon chicken. People color the feathers so the kids want to buy it. We can't do that to the chicken. Poor chicken. Right, tomorrow is Saturday. You will fix my room, right? Give me the cloth. Well, wipe it first. Let's put the chicken in here, okay? I bought it on my way home. There you are! Hey. Dear, come on. Hurry up and get ready to clean up. Please hold Agil. I need to prepare dinner. Okay, dear. Dad's home. Please clean up, okay? I need to help your mother. Wait a second. - Dear. - Yes? Auntie Salmah got a loan. But I don't know what to do with the money. Well, I think... I understand that Euis wanted her own room. After all, we used to sleep in different rooms before. But now, I'm upset that Dad broke his promise too. - This is Mickey Mouse? - Yes, Mickey Mouse. - Let's eat. Here's the rice. - Where is it? Where's the plate? Give the plate to your mother. I don't need any promises. I just need Dad to fix the room. I don't want to be promised anything anymore. Promises are just upsetting. And now that Agil is fussy, Mom is tired. So... You can talk? You miss your family? Me too. I also miss my family. Mom, I want to go to Aril's house, okay? Aril! Wait a minute. So, this chicken told you that it got lost? Yeah. I want to help Neon, but I don't want to promise anything. Who is Neon? This is Neon. This is Neon? - Yes. - So, that's Neon. They usually park there on Saturdays and Sundays. Mister. Have you seen the car that sells neon chickens? It's usually there. But I haven't seen it today. Do you know where the chickens come from? Of course. Far away, from Kampung Badak. It's called Kampung Badak, but they have a lot of chickens. That's very far. Grandpa and I cycled there once. See? Come on! Euis, let me borrow the pencil. Deni, ruler. Euis, do you have the lead? - Den. - Andi! Please focus! Yes. You're the group leader. Please pick someone else! What about Rindu? Euis? - No. - No. Well, Deni. He's smart. - No! - No! Ima. - No! - No! What's wrong with you? I'll treat you guys to meatballs at Mr. Aa's. Two servings! - No! - No! What do you mean two "servings"? Do you have money? You usually ask Rindu for money. No, Andi. The teacher wants you to be the group leader. Finish the assignment. This? Agil, come here. - Come here. - No. Just let her be. Are you not getting enough sleep? Agil has been really fussy the last two nights. She's teething. My husband is very busy too. He has to work early in the morning. So, I have to take care of Agil myself when she's fussy. Should we stop selling? No, of course not. It's not enough. I need to save money to replace the savings I have used. Auntie, I'm okay. One... Do you have time tomorrow to meet my friend, who agreed to give us a loan? Tomorrow, my husband has to go to town and take the company car. And Euis will hang out with her friends. - But I can try. Can I bring Agil with me? - Really? Wouldn't it be troublesome? No, I can do it. Well, I'll just borrow my relative's car so you and Agil can sit comfortably, okay? But, speaking about the loan, I still don't know what to do with it. This is really good! Really? - Yeah! Delicious! - What? Why do you want to help the chicken to find its family? I feel bad for it. You're right. The chicken must be sad to be away from his family. Right? So your mom and dad haven't come home yet? My father and mother said that they wanted to go home this year. But they got laid off, so it won't be possible. Maybe they will come home next year. Well, Neon, you're not alone. Aril also understands how you feel. His mother and father work in Jakarta. Jakarta is very far from here. What did it say? Nothing. Looks like Neon's not in the mood. If you really know the place that the guy mentioned, why don't we just go there right away? This stuff belongs to my grandfather. He used to be a soldier. We are here and Kampung Badak... is there. Is it far away? It's far. If you want to go there, you need an adult's help. Ara! Stop! Take the change. Thank you. Mr. Romli! Now, I can talk to the chicken. Ara, whose chicken is that? Is the chicken clean? Neon is clean. Dad sprayed it with sanitizer. Really? Yes, it's been sprayed. I found it when I got home from school. Really? The chicken said it got lost. Did the chicken say that? - Yes. - Amazing. It asked me to find its family. Mr. Romli, do you want me to help find this neon chicken's family? Looking for its family? Oh, no. Well, I want to do it, but... not now. It's getting dark. Of course not. We can't do it now. Ara, is your father home? I want to borrow the motorbike. I was at Aril's house and Dad went to the town this morning. Really? Can I see the "naon" chicken? - Neon chicken! - Right, neon chicken. It's cute. I'm home. I'm home too. Ara! I made fried chicken and played a bit with the seasoning. - Auntie Salmah said it is really good. - It's so tasty. I ate five pieces. I want you to try it. If you say it's good, this will be our next business. I don't want to eat your fried chicken. I'm friends with this neon chicken. It means all chickens are my friends, Mom. I can't betray my friends. Euis said we can't betray our friends. Right? If that's the case, let me try. I can be the judge of the fried chicken. I'm a pro. Mr. Romli, why do you want to eat my friends? But it's not the "naon" chicken. Neon chicken. It's neon chicken. I'm home. So, you don't believe me? I believe you. But you didn't believe that I could talk to chickens. If that's the case, then I don't believe you. If you want to talk to the chicken, be my guest, but if you say you can speak chicken, I don't believe it. But I can really talk to chickens, Dad. I don't believe you. Mr. Romli could talk to frogs. He just made that up. If you want to have a pet, I will support you, but I don't want you to go that far. I'm going to town tomorrow to take the car. Maybe you can take a trip with me. You want to go? No. Okay, then, you should have dinner. Don't forget to take it out. You're not coming with me? Let's say goodbye to Ara. - Ara, please stay home, okay? - Yeah? I'm heading out with Auntie Salmah. - Okay. - Air kiss time? Okay. One, two, three. Come on, sweetie. - Bye. - Bye. Let's go. Auntie Salmah. How are you? - We're good. Let's go. - You're good? Come on. Let's go. Okay. Let's get in. Mr. Romli! Mr. Romli! If we need an adult's help, we only have Mr. Romli. Only Mr. Romli believes me. I told him already and he agreed to help. Ara! Ara! Neon, what do we do now? Mr. Romli isn't here. What if we go there alone? You know where it is. And we have the map, right? What if it rains? Turn right. Can I see? Here. This way. No one's home? We can do the assignment first. My mother will come home soon. Are you doing your school assignment? Yes, ma'am. Euis, help. I need to find Ara first. Ara! When I came home, I didn't see her either, Mom. - Ducks! - So many ducks! So cute. It's very long! - Neon. - Neon! Aril. Let's play. Let's go! I'm going first. One, two, three. I can't. You couldn't do it. Look! A frog! The cage is not here either. It's because you don't have time to play with Ara. She is getting weird. Why are you taking it out on me? It's not my fault Ara is weird. Euis. Ma'am, I'm going now. Sit down. Hey, where are you going? You look tired. Why are you not saying anything? Let's just give them a ride. Ara! Ara! The chicken asked for help, so I couldn't say no. I don't believe you can talk to chickens. I didn't teach you to be a bad kid who lies to her parents. I never lie. But you lied now. I'm not lying. I can really talk to chickens. I don't believe you. Dear! Only Mr. Romli believes me. Do you want me to be angry at Romli? Why are you bringing up Mr. Romli? Mr. Romli believes that I can talk to chickens. Because in the past, he could talk to frogs. See? I have a reason to be angry with him. You don't have to be angry with Mr. Romli, it's my fault. Ara, I understand if you want to be friends with the chicken, but don't make us worry. What if the driver was reckless and you got into an accident? What if the driver was bad and you got kidnapped and trafficked? Why did you say that? God forbid. Come on, Ara. Now, promise us you won't do anything like that again. I don't want to promise anything. What? I don't want to be like you and Euis, who like to break promises. Ara, apologize to your father. Ara is not wrong, Mom. It's true. Whatever! If you want to promise or not, it's up to you! Look at me! If you do something like that again, I will be angry. Understand? Euis. Are you and Deni dating? Euis and Deni talk on the phone every night. No. Yes. Just a minute, Ara. I'm talking to Euis. She is not actually studying. She is so busy dating that she forgot her own sister. - No. - Yes. Is that true, Euis? They usually talk until dawn. You're staying up until dawn to talk with him instead of studying? Sorry, Neon. I failed you. You want me to sleep? - Dear. - Honey... Drink milk. My baby. My sweet baby. Dear, we can't stop Euis. Maybe it's time. I know. But I don't think being strict will solve the problem either. Well, we just need to explain everything to her. Ha! Sweetie. If she understands, we don't need to worry. Mom. - Where's the baby? Give the milk. - What? - Come on. - Drink! What about Ara? Shouldn't we just do what she wants? Looking for the neon chicken's family? It doesn't make sense. It's better to look for two more jobs, instead of looking for a family. I think it would be better if you paid more attention to Ara. Here. I'm doing that. It's just that Agil is fussy these days. The business is not doing good. That's why I want to sell fried chicken. You need to find time too. So we can still take care of Agil. Wouldn't it be better if you stopped for a while and let me work? We did that in the past anyway. We can't. If we only rely on you, we won't have any savings. What if there's another pandemic? You lost your job and we had to survive with my savings. No! No! No! I don't want to go back to those days. I want us to have savings. It's not only my job to take care of the kids, it's also your job. No. I'm still adjusting to my new job. I still need to learn how to manage my time. I'm adapting. Okay, you can rest now. If Agil wakes up in the middle of the night, I will take care of her. It's okay, you should rest. You have to get up early. Drink milk. My daughter is now a big girl. You like someone and is dating now. I feel like it was just yesterday... I heard your first cry. Please forgive your father. Your dad and I were shocked. You have grown up. I just want to say, everything you do has risks. There are advantages and disadvantages. So, you have to think about it carefully. Whenever you want to talk, I'm here for you. I will always listen... to whatever you want to tell me. Mom. Thank you, Neon. Are you ready? Come on. Let's go to school! Dad. Can I bring Neon to school? Neon will go home with me after school. Ara, do you want to study, or do you want to play around? Wow, it's been a long time since I took the kids to school by car. Air kiss time! Ara, you don't want to give an air kiss? Let Agil do it first. Air kiss! Our turn! - Bye! - Bye! Bye, Euis and Ara! Bye, Dad! CAHAYA CISARUA ELEMENTARY SCHOOL Ara. Please go straight home after school. - Here. - Thank you. - What do you want? - Come on. What color do you want? - The yellow one. - Yellow? - I want this one. - Okay, please wait. Let me get it. This is yours. Here is your change. - The change. - I want one! - What color do you want? - I want one! - You? Red? Okay. - Red! - I want the blue one. - You can take this. Wait a minute. One by one. - This one. - For you. Take good care of it, okay? I asked Grandpa about Kampung Badak. We won't get lost again. It's no use. My father will be angry. No one believes me. I believe you. Come on! The bike went into the river. Splash! And we made it through safely. Neon. Do you want to hear my new song? Neon? Are you sad? Don't be sad? If I still have the energy, we can go right away. I'll take you there. The problem is... This is the problem. The problem is my back pain. But do you believe it? Of course, I believe it. Back in the jungle, during the guerrilla era, I talked to anything and everything. I even talked to trees. If you want to find the chicken's family, you must do it immediately. They only have ten days to live. Only ten days? Just a moment, Ki. Take care. How can they act like lovebirds when they are only little kids? Right? What's the matter? Ara? What's wrong? Nothing. Neon. So, you're going to die soon? Aril said you're going to die. Just sit here. Let me do the sewing, okay? Dear, is Ara still sulking? Please find time for Ara. You promised to fix the room. I know, but I haven't found the right time. A lot of chickens at the farm died from stress. So, now, I have to find new chickens. It means more work. Shouldn't we help Ara to look for the chicken's family? I said I don't believe it. It doesn't make sense at all. Mom! Not everything has to make sense. She's just a child. If you're about to die, just sleep here. I bought two of them, but both are dead. Mine also died. It hasn't even been a week yet. Why did yours die? My father forgot to feed it. - Thank you, Mr. Ujang. - Oh, right. Romli. What's going on with Ara? What's wrong with Ara? She said she could talk to chickens. What is wrong with that? Why did you say you could talk to frogs? She believes it. Now, she's acting really weird. Well, when I was little, I could talk to frogs. Now, I'm learning to talk to chickens so I can be like Ara. - I can also talk to chickens. - See? Mr. Ujang can also talk to chickens, right? Mr. Ujang, we are serious now. It's not a joke. I'm not joking either, mister. I'm not lying. Why should I lie? - Lying is a sin. - It's a sin! Do you want to talk to the chickens? Come on. I'll teach you. Here. - Try it. - Come on. Just try. He wants to talk to you. Go ahead. What is this? What should I say? Just say anything. - I have to talk to the chicken? - Yes! That one showed up. Come on. Chicken, is the new food delicious? This is so weird! - I have a lot of work. Sorry. - Mister! Look! - You have to believe it! - Yes! You have to be sure and believe it! - Look! - Come on! Hurry. You're not worried your dad will be angry? Neon, I promise I will find your family. I'm not lying. I will do anything as long as you get to meet your family. Where do leeches come from? From the rice field to the river Where does love come from? From the eyes to the heart People say falling in love is restless People say lovesick is anxious But falling in love never changes -Still in love -Still in love -Falling in love, anytime -Falling in love, anytime -Comes with millions of feelings -Comes with millions of feelings Feeling restless and anxious Oh dear, that's how it goes That's how it goes Feeling restless and anxious -Oh dear, that's how it goes -Oh dear, that's how it goes Oh dear. Hey, where's Deni? I don't know. He's gone. Where is Deni, Andi? You guys are playing secret. - It's not fair. - Euis! Do you want to go home together? So cute! Can we do that? Yes. Come on. Just hop on. Ready? Ready. - Take care! - Be careful! Take care! Give me some. Sit down. Just a minute. I need to check something. Please hurry with the fried ice cream, okay? Sir! Ma'am, want to buy some flour? No. Have you seen Ara? She was here with Aril, but it looked like they're in a hurry. Ara is not home. Where could they be? I know. Ara must be looking for the chicken's family again. To Kampung Badak? It's a village with lots of chickens. No wonder they asked me about the village. Hey! - Sir. - Hey. I want to sell a goat. How much? - It's cheap. - How much? Right, please eat a lot. Tell your friends. Eat a lot so you don't get stressed. Finding new chickens is difficult, especially the good ones. Please help with my work. If you're all healthy, it would help my work, so I can be with my family. Yeah? Does anyone know Neon chicken? Anybody else? My daughter Ara found a chicken on the street and this chicken asked her help to find its family. Hopefully, they can find it. Hello? Just ask around. It's Kampung Badak. Romli, the brake! We almost fell! - Please call me if you have any news. - Ma'am! Where did she go? Let's go to the police! It has happened before. - We shouldn't panic. Don't panic! - Auntie. Don't panic! We're not sure. Don't call the police. I think Ara is looking for the chicken's family. What are you talking about? Ara is looking for the chicken's family again. What do you mean by looking for a chicken's family? By family, she means family. It's just a normal family! It means that there is a father, there is a mother, there is a brother... I know, but it's a chicken. - Still, it's a family! - Nuts! - Ma'am, come on! - Just a minute. Don't panic. Maybe we can help. Shall we look for them? - Let's go. - I'll stay at home and take care of Agil. Okay. Come on, Auntie! - Come on. - Let's go! Ma'am. Ara is funny. When your family just moved here, she looked happy. No. She's not funny anymore. She's now troublesome. No. She's still funny. That's what I think. Maybe she looks up to you. With you not being able to walk her home and asking to separate your rooms, it all made her sad. Maybe she also wants to show you and your family that she's not a kid anymore. She can be responsible. But not with her talking to chickens and looking for the family. Well, I can understand why she does that. Maybe she just wants to be a good friend. That's why she is willing to do all of that. I don't think we passed this road last time. Yes, but this way should be faster. Okay, then, just be careful. I don't think it's working. You must have used an ancient map and we got lost. Watch your mouth. I'm up to date. See for yourself. Here! We missed the right turn. It was the previous turn! You recklessly picked the turn! Who told me to go this way? - You! - Auntie! Why are you blaming me? Look, ducks. We have to get there before dark. The road is blocked for now. Just go back. Sir, can you open the roadblock? I can't. It's locked. Thank you. - We need to turn back. - Yes. So troublesome. - You know it's a narrow road. - Auntie! We need to pull the motorbike! We have to pull it! You know very well that I'm a classy lady! You can't ask me to pull it! Auntie, please help. No! Auntie! So annoying! Slowly, Auntie. You're going to make me fall. Are you not afraid to meet my father? What? I didn't hear you. Please speak louder. Are you not afraid to meet my father? No. Why do I need to be afraid? There's nothing wrong. VILLAGE BORDER CV. UNGGAS MANDIRI - CHICKEN FARM Neon, where do we go from here? What did it say? Neon is tired. Tired? But it didn't do anything. Where are we going now? Which way? Ara! Ara. This is far, Ara. Dad, don't be angry with Aril. This is what I want. Ara! Euis, what are you doing here? Mom asked me to do it, to find her missing child. She's not missing. She's here. What are you doing here? This is too far! Stop it. Ara. I apologize for not believing you. I understand that you mean well. So you promised Neon? I did. I made a promise, so I have to keep it. Yes, let's try to ask Neon. Where do we go from here? It's almost dark. Let me get you there. Neon, Dad wants to know where do we go from here? Come on. Tell me so we can get there before dark. That way. Neon said we should go there. - The neon chicken said that? - Yes. Wow, that's great. Ara can talk to chickens. Ara, is this the right way? Ask Neon. Neon, is this the right way? This is the right way, Dad. - Are you sure? - I am. It's true that we need an adult's help. Right. - This is the coffee. - Coffee? Hey, do you want coffee? - Do you want it? - You want coffee? Hey, who is that? So many people. Right. That's a whole group. Neon, is this your family? Do you need help, sir? - Hello. Good afternoon. - Yes? What? Right. It's Jono's friend, honey. The red one. But this is really the family, right? - Yes. It's the right family. Thank you. - Yes. - Yes. You're very cute. - Romli! What are you doing? Everyone's here! I told you. Don't trust your map! - Back then, this area... - It was a forest. - That was a rice field before. - I see... Thank God we... Good evening, mister. Come in. - What is this? - A little something from my mother. Tell your mother I said thank you. Come in. I'm sorry I disappointed you. I couldn't keep the promise to always come home from school together. It's okay. The promise was in the past anyway. Now, I understand why you are busy. I'm sorry for making you upset too. Here's the thing. Let's not make empty promises. If we have time to go home together, let's just do it. I think that's a good idea! Dad promised to fix my room. But I don't know when. You don't have to wait for him. You have me. Let's do it together. - Let's do it! - Yeah! But before we do that, I have a present that can sleep with you. A present? Open it. We might not sleep in the same room anymore, but I can still be with you. Thank you, Euis. It's okay if you want to sleep in my room once in a while. But please knock on the door. Roger that! Do you want to listen to my song? Come on. Show me. Euis, Ara, everyone's waiting downstairs. Let's have dinner. They've been waiting for you two. Euis gave me a lamp. - A lamp? - Yeah! So we need to take pictures of the opak and fried chicken, then we sell them online. It's late. Enough talking about business. Let's enjoy this. Goat curry! But we need to proceed with the business. I don't want to be a loan woman forever. Sure. Mister, only rice? Where's the curry? You want to enjoy it first? Okay, let Romli be the first to try. I'm okay if you guys want to eat chicken. - Dear, Ara's willing to eat chicken. - Yes? I won't eat them, but it's okay if the others want to. Have some curry. Here. Ara, please eat a lot. You eat a lot, right? I can start with a little bit. Dad. Yes? It looks like I can talk to goats now. Ara, please not now. The goat... The goat is already in my mouth. Ara, so, can we eat the curry or not? You can. - I thought it was the same. - Gosh. Aril, here. - You can have more later. - Eat this. Ara, please eat a lot. What do you want? Mom, Agil, hurry up. Let's go. Agil! Ara, it looks weird now. What are you doing? Euis even joined in. Watch out! Look! Come on. Put your hand in there. - Come here. Put it on the wall. - Put it on the wall. Your mother should do it too! That's Ara. - Ara! - Euis! Hey, slowly! Ara!
