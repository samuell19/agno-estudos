Felt like a long time but it's here... Let the good vibes roll in... If you look outside it's snowing... And Santa's on the way... Do those trees look crooked to you? No. Everything looks beautiful, Elle. You always do such an amazing job. This is the last winter formal of our high school career. Everything needs to be perfect. Hey, I heard you got early acceptance to Stanford. That's incredible. It was... it was a long shot but it worked out. Um... have you heard back from any schools, Kam? Oh! Principal Holt just busted the lovebirds. I think me and Katie got put on the naughty list. I couldn't help myself. Look what Jay just gave me. He said the Christmas tree is to remember tonight and the rest is for our future. Aww. Yeah. Hey, is this dress too short? I think it's too short. No. I think your dress looks great, Sam. You sure? Promise. I need to find a mirror. Just ask him to dance already. He's smart... and he's driven. Sounds like someone I know. We would be perfect together. But he just thinks of me as a friend and I wouldn't want to mess that up. Whatever. Don't tell me the winner of every academic award and president of every extra-curricular activity lacks the confidence to ask someone to dance. Come on, babe. Um... Abbi Ferguson just winked at me. I'm... I'm gonna ask her to dance. Cool! Cool... Alright everyone. Gather around, gather around. It's a very exciting time, I know. Come on. It's the announcement you've all been waiting for. The crowning of your 2007 winter royals. Whoop, whoop, whoop! Go Bobcats! Oh... sorry. Really Devin? Sorry. Sorry. These shoes are really slippery. What are you wearing? It's festive... like me. Just please try and take this seriously. And without further ado... your class president, Elle Chamberlain. Yeah! And your inexplicable choice for class vice-president... Devin Ryan. Thank you, Principal Holt. Class of 2007... you voted and results are in. I just want to compliment Elle and the decorating committee. I never made it to any of the meetings, but look how well that worked out. I mean, what a party, am I right? Yeah! Let's not keep everybody hanging. And... your first winter royal is... Bryce McGuire. Yes! Whoo! What? Oh, my turn. My turn. Okay. Let's... This is really good glue. May I? Your next winter royal is... Uh, Elle Chamberlain. Yeah, Elle! Congratulations. Thanks. Is it snowing? And you didn't think I helped with the decor. It's magical, right? Ohhhh! I am so sorry. I'd say one of my greatest strengths is that I'm calm under pressure. Managing the data cloud storage division can be demanding but I like to think I bring a sense of balance to the day-to-day operations. And I'm proud of the high standards we've been able to achieve in my 10 years here at Zigg. So... how does it feel to be on Wired magazine's 35 under 35 list? Is it cheesy to say it's a dream come true... because it is. Just in time to show off at your 15 year high school reunion. So far we have a 61 percent RSVP rate. That's insane. I know. It's a good turnout. No, it's insane that you did the math on the RSVP's. The location is locked. The caterers just confirmed. And you triple-checked timing of the party vendor, yes? They're delivering everything Wednesday. Perfect. This must be the most well-planned reunion in the history of reunions. It better be. This is the first one our class has ever had. Every event since our senior year winter formal was such a catastrophe, they nicknamed us the cursed class. Prom was ruined when the septic tank ruptured. Graduation was cut short by a bout of food poisoning. Wow. Our five-year reunion was a bust thanks to Hurricane Sandy and our 10-year reunion was in the summer and literally three people RSVP'd. Which is why I moved this one to Christmas when everybody would be home for the holidays. This year... no excuses. No disasters. I'm gonna get it right. Another RSVP. Oh... Everything okay? It's just... there's this one person from my class who hasn't responded to the invite. And you hoped he would? Oh, I love unrequited high school love. I wouldn't go quite that far. I was valedictorian. He was salutatorian. It just would've made sense. Not the steamy romance I had in mind but to each their own. And according to his social media he's newly single. You always do your research, don't you? Oh, uh... your car will be here in 15 minutes. I charged all your devices, updated your calendar and packed your food for your flight. Thank you. You are the best. Um... Is there something else, Alma? It's just, some of the assistants have been talking. Is Zigg in some kind of legal trouble? Those are just rumors. If there was something going on, Tom would tell me. Especially when we're this close to going public. Don't worry about it. Have a wonderful holiday break and I'll see you in the new year. Okay. Thank you. Customer service please head over to the wrapping aisle. Customer service to the wrapping aisle This is Devin. Oh, absolutely. My team is loading the truck as we speak. See you soon. Bye-bye. Dad. Daughter. Thank you. Can I have your credit card for some in-app purchases? Nope. Uh... but you could tackle this pile of paperwork I asked you to file. Paper is so old school. Why don't you let me build you a digital database and you can get rid of all these file cabinets. You could put in a treadmill desk. First off, have you seen this warehouse? I get my steps in every single day, thank you very much. Secondly, how did my daughter get to be such a tech genius? Digital native. Evolve or perish. Hey, so I have a walk-through at the Hotel Grand but then I was thinking... pizza. Sound good? Pizza always sounds good. What's the event? It's my high school class reunion. Fifteen years. So it's an old people party? Excuse me, 15 years was not that long ago and I was fun back then, still am. If you say so. Plus, I'm not actually going to the reunion. I'm just gonna be there for load in and load out, that is it. Why? Uh, because the only reason people go to a reunion is to either show off or relive the past and I'm not interested in either one of those things. Anyone I really wanna catch up with I just look up online. Do you know how to do that? Hey! Don't forget, offers are due in by 7:00 on Thursday. Thanks for coming. Merry Christmas. I think we need to work on the talking points for the kitchen. Did you mention the induction oven? After selling houses for 10 years I think I know how to talk up a kitchen. Fine. I know we're getting at least four offers anyway. We have to review the new housing development contracts. Just put it in my calendar. Our primary way of communicating these days. Don't start. And about tonight... Yeah. We should just pretend like everything's normal. Easier than answering questions, right? Okay. See you there. I love that they included everyone's yearbook pictures in the reunion invite email. Like you don't have any unfortunate photos of your high school self. I burned every single one. I have news. News or gossip? What's the difference? So, Stan heard from someone that the New York office is filling their field reporter position by Christmas. Which means that by Friday you'll know if you're- we're, moving to New York. Indianapolis I love you but Big Apple I am ready. It's a long-shot though. So is winning a Tony but Audrey McDonald has six. Samantha... Sam. As your friend and forever hype person, I can't believe that after everything you've accomplished, you still doubt yourself. Because I'm not usually the one who gets the thing. I get close or I'm in the running but I don't take the gold. You know sports metaphors don't work on me. I just... wanna feel seen. Didn't happen much in high school. Well... they can't miss you now. So we'll bake the cookies tomorrow for Winterfest and then let's drive out to the Christmas ranch to look at the lights. Oh, and Tommy and Michelle are hosting a night of caroling in their neighborhood. I know they'd love to see you and hear about all your success. Even though I tell them about it all the time. Okay. I just love having my Noelle home for a whole week. It's a perfect holiday. Mom... I know, I know. You go by Elle. I'll just never understand why you don't use your given name. Everyone loves this time of year. Some more than others. Welcome home, sweetheart. Thanks Dad. Going up, going up. Honey, look. I made space on our wall of achievement for the Wired article when it comes out. Oh, you didn't have to do that. Nonsense. We love to see you succeed and when people come over they can see everything. Oh, your father's stocking, I could use your help picking out some things. Actually, I have to swing by the hotel to do a walk-through and then I'm meeting up with the old gang at Bobbie's Bar tonight. Well... we'll find a time. Hi. You must be Fritz. And you must be 15 minutes late. I apologize. I had to borrow my dad's car and he lost the keys. It was a whole thing. No problem at all. Waiting on clients is what we at the Hotel Grand do. Okay, so we also brought six ivory columns and then some, just, really nice holiday foliage that will fit perfectly in the layout. Oh, just in time to meet the meticulous mastermind behind this soiree. If you ever want a job in event planning let me know. I'm looking for my replacement. Devin Ryan. Elle Chamberlain. I... I forgot. Liv It Up is your parents' company. Yeah, it was. They retired. It's my company now. I've been emailing with someone named Alma. My assistant. Ah. Well, I, um... I haven't seen you since, um... Graduation? Uh... it wasn't graduation. I was surfing in Baja. I didn't see the point in wearing a robe and walking across a stage. Right. Ceremony was never your thing. Small world bumping into you like this. Not really. It's the job of the class president to plan the reunions. Wait, the job of high school class president lasts outside of high school? Is it like a lifelong position? You have to admit that's kind of crazy. It's not crazy. It's how reunions work. Saved by the bell. Ah, it's about those custom blue silk tablecloths you specially requested to match your exact high school colors. Be back in a jiff. I noticed that you didn't RSVP. Yeah, reunions really aren't my thing either. Well, one less name-tag I need to make. Um... I appreciate the business. Is there somebody else I should be dealing with at the company? Why? It's just... not to be rude, but I need this reunion to go smoothly. And the fact that the high school king of goofing off is in charge of setting up, it just... makes me kind of nervous. How could I possibly consider that rude? Uh, look... high school was a long time ago. We're northern Connecticut's premiere events company. You're in good hands. Sorry about that. I'm gonna go tape off the stage so my guys know where to put everything. Mmmhmm. You two make a wonderful team. Katie! Yay, you're here! Oh, I missed you. I missed you. Let's immediately get you a drink and you can catch me up on your amazing life. Uh, my amazing life? You two have billboards all over town. I must've seen your face five times on the way home from the airport. You and Jay are killing it. So, where is he? Oh, finishing up some work, I'm sure. He'll be here any minute. Elle! Hi. Well, the reunion fun can start finally. Fifteen years... And still our class president. And you guys are still the most epic love story to come out of Brookswood High. Married 10 years. That is amazing. So what are you guys doing to celebrate? Uh... We just signed a contract with a new developer. Yeah. So that's kind of the focus right now. But what about you, are you running Silicon Valley yet? Uh, not yet but it's going well and I love my job and Zigg is a great place to work. Most likely to succeed out there succeeding, right? I'm gonna go see about getting us some drinks. Thank you. So how's the reunion coming together? Everything is coming together perfectly. Except today I learned that our main vendor is none other than Devin Ryan. You remember him? I mean, still as infuriating as ever. But the numbers are looking good. Kam still hasn't RSVP'd. Don't tell me you're still crushing on him after all these years. Uh, of course... of course not. No. No, I mean, it would just be nice to, you know, see him and catch up. And maybe show off your big, cool job in tech? I mean, no... maybe a little. Uh... I gotta grab this, um, but I'll be right back. Okay. Hey Alma. What's up? Those rumors about Zigg having legal issues... well, those aren't rumors anymore. It's really bad, Elle. How bad are we talking? They're saying it's a federal investigation... as in the FBI. Have you heard from Tom yet? I cannot afford to lose this job. Elle? Kam? I thought that was you. Oh wait, is that him? The guy that you were talking about? Uh... I'll call you back. Hi! Hi. Did I interrupt a work call? Uh... just work drama. It's probably nothing. How are you? I didn't think you were coming. I didn't think I was either but then my schedule changed so I thought, why not? Well, I'm glad you did. Should we go inside? - Yeah. - Yeah. Okay. You know, they actually have machines that print your signature so you don't have to do it by hand. Yeah, but all our customers and our friends appreciate a handwritten message. Besides, if I didn't make you do this, you might forget how to use a pen. I wanna add something to my Christmas list. Sky... Christmas is only a few days away. It's a little late for that, honey. That's okay because all you have to do is say yes. Yes to what? There's this coding and robotics camp this summer. It's really hard to get into but I wanna try. Okay. It's four weeks. Where? Carnegie Mellon. Pittsburgh? Pittsburgh's not that far. Tell you what, I'll send you all the info. The application's due before the end of the year. Four weeks is a long time. Aren't you a little young for that? No. Besides, four weeks without me means you're free to go do fun stuff too. Hmm... Jam with your band. Rake the yard. Play poker. Rake the yard? I'm 13. How am I supposed to know what dads do for fun? Please, Dad? Please, Dad'ing me... Send me the link, I'll consider it. Yes! Let's do this. High school, eat your heart out. Sam! You made it. I cannot believe how fabulous you look. Thanks. It comes with the job. And, uh, a brilliant stylist. This is James. I don't know what I would do without him. Uh, you'd still be wearing frosted lip gloss and culottes. Oh, I missed you guys. Ladies, it's lovely to meet you but now I need some drinks. This round's on me. Thank you. There she is, our fearless leader. You having fun? Oh yeah, it's great seeing everyone. In fact, it feels like serendipity reconnecting with you right now because I'm actually moving to the Bay area after the holidays. Um... really? Wow. I mean, talk about timing. I'll be managing a senatorial campaign up there. It's the big leagues. That sounds incredible, Kam. But also challenging and stressful. Ah, I thrive on it. I bet we have that in common. You're the CTO of one of the hottest tech companies on the market. You're a dynamo. Just like in high school. It'll be fun getting to know each other again. And my clients will be so impressed that I know you. Uh, hi Tom. I know this is my third voicemail. I'm just starting to worry that I haven't heard back from you. If you could let me know everything's okay that would be great. Black coffee, please. I think this is yours. Thank you. I wonder if M and N are around here somewhere. Huh? If you're Elle... I'm looking for M and N. That's a bad joke. Uh... I haven't had my coffee yet, obviously. Since you're here... can we talk Santa hats? What about them? I wanted to add Santa hats so we could take a class photo with everyone wearing one. That wasn't part of the original order. I know. I had the idea this morning. But if you can't make that work, you can say so. Your boring black coffee. Oh, thank you. Oh my gosh, you're Elle Chamberlain! Dad, I didn't know you knew anyone famous. Dad? Famous? Elle gave a TED Talk about coding from the female perspective. It was awesome. Uh... well, thank you. Can we rewind to the part about you having a daughter? Yeah, this is Skylar. My 13 going on 50 year old who apparently watches TED Talks. Elle and I went to high school together. I'm a coder too, app design. Nice. Uh... what software do you use? Appery but I also build my own. That is very impressive. I'm applying for the summer coding program at Carnegie Mellon. Could I use you as a reference? Skylar. I'd be happy to be a reference. It's a great program. I was actually a speaker there last summer. Of course you were. Uh, but that's very nice. Thank you. Yes, thank you. I'll wait in the car. I gotta admit, I never pictured you as a parent to a teenager. A single parent to a teenager and trust me, I am aware. She seems so cool and smart and she likes to build software. Well, the cool part she clearly gets from me. Uh, but the tech part not so much. She wants to go to this coding camp and I think she should be out having fun, be a kid. Well, if she's anything like me, then programming is fun. And she'll meet a lot of other kids with similar interests. Hmm. Um... I'll add the Santa hats. I'd appreciate that, thank you. We haven't done this together in years. I didn't realize how much I missed it. It wouldn't be our Winterfest charity fundraiser without my signature snowflake and snowman cookies. They always sell out. Wow, Mom. Look at you! So... tell me everything about last night. Who you saw. What everyone is up to. How impressed they all are with your job. Not everybody cares about stuff like that. Everyone seemed really good. I mean, Katie and Jay are as in love as ever and killing it in the real estate world. Samantha has really come into her own. Kam was there. Oh really? He's, um... actually moving to the Bay area in the new year. Isn't that something? Sounds like fate to me. Does he have a good job? A Master's degree? Mom... What? Just asking. A thank you holiday ham from Bill Wilson. Same gift every Christmas, like clockwork. Oh... right. You keep it. It'll save you from ordering in. So, um, what are you doing for Christmas? I'll go to my Mom's. I'll just tell her you have to work. Well... it's definitely not how I saw this year going. Hey, look... I understood when you told me you needed space. It's a lot. Working together, being married. I guess I just... don't see where we go from here. It feels like our life's running us instead of the other way around. I know we make a great team but it's not enough. We both know that. It's funny. We used to be this couple that everybody wanted to be. Look at us now. If only they knew. They'd be disappointed. Just like we are. This place is so freaking festive I can't handle it. Sam? Hi. I thought that was you. Bryce. Hi, I'm James. Samantha's, uh, platonic best friend. Nice to meet you, James. Sam, you look fantastic. Thanks. So do you. I assume you guys are here for the reunion too. Yeah. Wouldn't miss it. Bryce was captain of the swim team... and winter royal... and voted best looking in the yearbook. And now I'm in grad school for urban planning in New York. Oh, how about that. Sam and I might be there soon too for work. We're talking national news for a certain well-known morning show. What are you doing? I'm starting rumors. It's one of my many skills. Well you'll have to look me up some time. Both of you. I gotta go but, um... see you guys around. Looking forward to it. Come on Tom, pick up. Pick up, pick up, pick up. Where are you, Tom? Thank you, guys. Good set, guys. Thank you, it was good. You guys were great up there. Thanks. Yeah, a couple of guys from the band are still around. The band? Like the high school senior year talent show band? Yeah. Didn't you guys have a terrible name like- The Harmony Wizards. Hmm. What can I say? We were raised on American Idol and Harry Potter. And you were playing one of Jay's parties and your amps blew, like, a fuse? The entire neighborhood lost power. Yeah, that was us. Huh. But I only play the acoustic guitar now so you don't have to worry. Oh, well that's... that's a huge relief. Yeah, I switched over when, um, Skylar was born. Uh, when she was a baby she loved listening to me play but now, you know, she'd rather run around with her friends than listen to me. Well, did you wanna hang out with your parents when you were her age? I know you're making a valid point but it doesn't mean I like it. Uh... I was kinda hoping if I won her a couple prizes from the fun and games area, maybe she'd be impressed with her old man. Okay. One, do not use old man. We are barely in our 30s. And two, I could stand to blow off some steam at the snowball throw. Hmm. Everything okay? Yeah, just some work stress. Okay. Okay. You promise not to be a sore loser? No, of course, because I'm not gonna lose. You know, I still would've respected you if you would have thrown a game or two my way. You wish. Hey. It's your mom's cookie booth. Oh wow, these look amazing. Skylar's gonna love these. And it matches the keychain I won. Hey, Elle! Wow, those look delicious. Hey Kam. Put me down for a box too. Devin Ryan. It's been a long time. Yeah. It, uh, it has. Devin's company's doing the setup for the reunion. Nice. So you're still living around here? Yeah. That must be a trip. I can't imagine. What do you mean? Just, you know, living in your hometown still. Anyway, um... a bunch of people are gathering at Page Park tomorrow. Wanna go, Elle? Go sledding together? You too. Uh, sure. That'd be great. Devin, you in? Why not? Look what I found. Don't mind me. What are you wearing and why? Please tell me you didn't dig this up just to make fun of my teenage style choices. I wanted to see if you and Elle were friends back then. We didn't really run in the same circles, Sky. She was more of a color inside the lines kind of person and I was... fun. Can I have my laptop back please? She's super smart, Dad. I'm aware of that. Hey, I was thinking. Um... this coding camp. I looked at the website and I read some reviews and it looks pretty fantastic. And I hear you'll meet a lot of kids with the same interests. Does that mean I can go? You promise to FaceTime me twice a day? Yes, yes, yes! Thank you, Dad. And this, um, digital database you mentioned... is that something you could really build? Totally! Uh, you would have one section for inventory and another for accounts. I can use it as my project for the coding camp application. I can start right now. Sorry. I'll use mine. There it is. I used to love coming here as a kid. Even in high school. On snow days we used to all show up and we would compete to see how many people we could fit on a sled. I never really understood the fun of sledding. I mean, all the way up a hill just for a few seconds of sliding down, during which you could break your arm or ruin your blowout. Where's your sense of adventure? Oh... he's here. Who? Bryce. - Oh, um... Samantha... - Hey there. Hey guys. I see you decided on staying warm and dry. We don't have sleds. Well, I'm happy to share. Sam, you can go first and then, uh, you and I can go down together. Um... I would, I would love to. Yeah, sledding is totally, uh, my thing. Uh... can you just give us a sec? Great. I'll meet you up top. I thought you knew. It's like I invent new ways to embarrass myself. Just say the word and I won't even so much as look at him again. No, no. Don't be silly. He likes you. Go. Have some adventure. I'll sit here and enjoy my hot chocolate. Thank you. Hey. Where's James? Sledding with Bryce. At least one of us is getting noticed. What do you mean? This reunion is bringing up all sorts of high school feelings for me. Isn't it strange how you can go make a whole life for yourself and then you're still trying to impress people you don't even know anymore? Actually not as strange as you might think. And everybody loved you in high school. No, everyone loved you in high school. I was in the background... Invisible. Not to me you weren't. I called you when I was out in San Francisco last year. I know, I'm sorry. I should've called you back. I just get so tunnel-visioned with my job sometimes that I forget to have a personal life. You work so hard, do everything you're supposed to. It's like, does it even matter, you know? What's it all for? Elle, is everything okay? Yeah. Yeah I'm, uh... just having a moment. Hey. Uh... can I talk to you for a second? - Yeah. - Yeah. Let me just say, if you wanna race me down the hill I'm gonna warn you, my middle name is Speed. Um... the hotel called. We have a problem. Oh, I'm sure it's nothing we can't handle. The fire in the kitchen was containable. Okay. But the smoke and water damage to the ballroom is significant. As much as I've so enjoyed working with you both, there is no way we can host your reunion. We can fix this. We just need to find another location. At least your props and equipment weren't loaded in yet. Uh, Elle... Hmm? We loaded it all in last night. I wanted the crew to get an early start to make sure everything would be ready for tomorrow. Including the Santa hats. Insurance will cover what we lost, but even if you do find another place, all my holiday stuff is already spoken for for other events. Is it the worst thing if there's no reunion? People have been looking forward to this for months and I for one am not gonna let them down. Has our class had an extraordinarily long list of calamities? Yes. Is it strange that it keeps happening? Yes. Hmm. But does that really mean that our class is cursed? - Yes? - No! This is just a small roadblock. It's a speed-bump. If it seems like things are going wrong, well that's when you need to roll up your sleeves and get to work. We have a little over 24 hours to pull it together. This Christmas class reunion will happen. Alright, team. Ideas. Shout them out. My brother in law runs the bakery down on Main. I'll see if he can get us some free desserts. We have a bunch of small tchotchkes we use to stage houses. Christmas trees, lights, bows. I can contact the local news station, see if they're willing to help out with some sound equipment. Perfect. We'll take everything we can get. Thanks everybody. Okay. I'm gonna research some new locations, make some calls. And I'll look around the warehouse to see if there's anything that even resembles holiday inventory that I can scrounge up. That's great. Okay. Good luck. Alright. Hi. Hey. What are you doing here? Just more reunion planning. Your dad went to go locate some inventory. See, that's exactly what I'm trying to help him with. If he had a digital database, everything would be at his fingertips. That's... a really good idea. You wanna see? Absolutely. Ever since my grandparents retired, Dad has really expanded some things around here, except for the technology. So, I thought I'd help him join the 21st century. These are all of your dad's clients? He has some pretty big accounts. Everybody loves my dad. He's always dependable so his customers are super loyal. Anyway, I've got some more backend work to do but this is pretty much it. Well, I would say that you're off to a really great start. You are lightyears ahead of where I was at your age. Getting feedback from you is, like, really awesome. Well, you're, like, really awesome. I'm sure you're realizing who the real brains behind this operation is. Honey, can you give us a second? Bye Elle. Bye Skylar. So there might be one possible last resort option for some decorations. But it won't be pretty. Welcome to the land of lost decorations. Otherwise known as the storage room where I keep the older stuff no one wants to rent. Hmm. My mother would love this. I think she would honestly faint. There is no one who loves Christmas more than her. Uh, I'll take that bet. You should see my parents' place. They have an inflatable nativity scene on the front lawn. Year round. That's pretty good but, uh, I'll do you one better. Elle is my nickname. My given name is... Noelle. You're joking. No, I'm not. Game over, you win. Okay, so I'm guessing this isn't up to the usual Elle Chamberlain standards but, I mean, it's better than nothing. Well, it'll definitely need some TLC. But, you know, we can make this work. Where do we even start? Well, anything that doesn't disintegrate when you touch it is up for grabs. Oh. Okay. This is like a dream playground for a kid. Skylar must love it. Well, she did. She's a little old for it now. Which she constantly reminds me about. She likes you though. She's a great kid, Devin. And you're doing a wonderful job. What about Skylar's mom? Yeah, they FaceTime twice a week. She's deployed overseas, uh, Air Force. We were, uh, just a couple of college kids and it didn't work out. Never would've planned my life to go this way but sometimes the best things are the ones you didn't plan. Devin Ryan, you are full of surprises. Fifteen years ago I couldn't get you to attend a single student government meeting and now you're helping save the reunion. Thank you. I really appreciate all this. Yeah, well if you want some assistance with finding some other venues, I could help make some calls. Sure, uh, that would be, um, great. If you wanna swing by tomorrow morning? Sure. Oh. Hey. Uh... Bobbie said that he could lend us some of the chafing dishes so I figured I'd just swing by and pick them up. I just came by to pick up some of the decor we lent him for his holiday karaoke. Ah, right. Hey, my brother asked about Christmas Eve dinner. I said you'd be at your mother's. This will be the first Christmas we spent apart since we were teenagers. I know. It's kind of hard for me to imagine Christmas morning without your freshly baked monkey bread. Makes it all feel very... real. Well, I should... yeah. Tom, I'm trying really, really hard not to freak out over here. If you could give me a call back in the morning, I would greatly appreciate it. Elle, honey... you have a visitor. Hey. Hey. So, how's operation save the reunion going? Uh, great. It's, uh, it's gonna be great. We're gonna figure it out and find a new venue. It'll be great. Very convincing. Look, it's pretty late and people who don't work as hard as you have probably already gone home for the day. Right. There's this really cool thing called dinner. Maybe you've heard of it? I think it kind of rings a bell. So... why don't we go grab a bite? I have still so much to do. Come on, you deserve a break. Plus, I already made reservations. One of our old favorites. I guess I could go for a nice meal. I used to think this was the epitome of fine dining when we were kids. I did too. I am so sorry. This is not what I was picturing for our first dinner. We should go somewhere else. No. Sometimes the best things are the ones that you didn't plan, right? And this is definitely the only restaurant in town with moussaka a la Christmas. Red and green sauce. Brilliant. Hey, we're all in town for the nostalgia so let's go for it. Here's to being old enough to drink at the classiest Greek restaurant in the tru-state area. Cheers. Cheers. Oh, sorry I couldn't make the emergency meeting today but I had a couple big conference calls. But this is what reunions are all about. Reconnecting. True. I have to be honest with you. I googled you a few days ago. You're a really intriguing person. I mean, you always were. Um... I actually looked you up online too. You did? I was also curious. Mmhmm. I, um... I had a huge crush on you senior year. Really? Okay, don't laugh. But I had the perfect fantasy planned in my head for winter formal. You would surprise me at my house all dressed to the nines, holding a corsage. And you would ask me if you could escort me to the ball and then we would dance the night away with all of our friends. Why didn't you say something? I... I don't know. Uh... I was working up the nerve and then you asked Abbi Ferguson to dance. Oh. And obviously the rest of the night went a bit sideways. Yes, it did. Why didn't you ever ask me out? To be honest with you, Elle... you were way out of my league. What? Valedictorian. Class president. President of a lot of things actually. Speaking of being president of things... I'm putting together an advisory panel of tech industry professionals for one of my clients. I'd love to get your feedback on it. Oh. Uh... sure. Mmhmm. Great. Alright. What do we got? So I put together a spreadsheet of 23 potential venues within a 40-mile radius. I should've ordered doubles. They're booked through Easter. We definitely need heat in the bathrooms, right? Yes, having a broken elevator for a restaurant on the 36th floor is a deal breaker. Your auditorium is still an active crime scene for a double murder? Exotic dancers? Your name, "The North Pole", is very misleading. Well, that was the last one on the list. We're toast. We just need to think outside the box. We're resourceful people. We could turn any space into a winter wonderland. I mean, you even made magic out of our high school gym at winter formal. It wasn't all magic that night. Let's do that again. Flood a gym? Yes. No. I mean, not the flooding part, the gymnasium. It's big, it's nostalgic, and it has heated bathrooms. That's either the greatest idea of all time or the worst. But we really don't have any other options, do we? Who would we even call? Believe it or not, Principal Holt is still running the show at Brookswood. And I know exactly where to find him. Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas! Merry, merry. Ho, ho, ho! Best time of the year. It's a shock, I know. I mean... he looks great. Smile for Santa! And have you been good this year? Aren't you guys a little... not eight years old to be visiting Santa Clause? Well... We're just... Shh. It's okay. This is a safe space for true believers like us. Hi. Uh... Principal Holt, it's Elle Chamberlain. Principal Holt? My dear, my name is Santa Clause. Of course, uh, Santa. Do you remember me? Santa Clause never forgets a name. Especially from the nice list. Hello Santa. Devin Ryan. I'm pretty sure your name's still at the top of the naughty list. We have a really big favor to ask. Can we use the high school's gym for the reunion tonight? Well, that doesn't sound as much like a favor as a Christmas wish. That's really Santa's specialty. Take a seat. Okay. However, the school is closed for the remainder of the year, so... I know, and we wouldn't be asking unless it was our truly last and only hope. We literally have hours before the reunion is supposed to begin and we're desperate. And you know, the class of 2007 has faced its challenges over the years. Some of them were your holly-jolly doing, if I do recall, my dear boy. Smile. Please, Santa. We just wanna get the class together. It would be our Christmas wish. Peppermint! Peppermint. If you promise me there will be no mischief... Devin. I will grant you your Christmas wish. Thank you, Santa. Oh... got me. The magic of Christmas. Perfect. Elle, come check this out. This is looking great. Great! Your brother in law really came through for us. Thanks. Have you seen Kam? He said that he'd set up the check-in table but I haven't heard from him. No, sorry. Not bad for an emergency back-up plan. You did it. Uh, we did it. Tonight the cursed class breaks the curse. Couldn't have done it without you. Hmm, something tells me you would've found a way. What a difference 15 years makes. Yeah. I should, uh, make sure the, um... speakers are plugged in. And I'm gonna go check on the name-tags. Okay. You know, this place brings back so many memories. We should recreate our yearbook photo with the group except without the embarrassing hairstyles this time. Katie, is everything okay? Jay moved out a month ago. What? Please don't say anything. I don't know what we're doing. All this on top of that and it's Christmas... my head is swimming. Hey. Hey. I'm so sorry you guys are going through this. I guess I always just imagined the two of you as the perfect couple. I know, everyone thinks that. I thought that. But there's no such thing as perfect. We used to have fun together, make each other laugh. And now... I guess I was kinda hoping the reunion would bring something back for us. Maybe it will. You'll find your way through this. Oh! You look amazing. Okay, um... and this isn't working with this. What's... what's wrong? I was hoping to have some good news about New York for tonight. Samantha... Please remember that you are bravely pursuing your dreams and it is working. All that matters is what you think of you. Well, and what I think of you. Let's go get 'em. Hey. Which... which one? Huh? Huh? Huh? The green one, obviously. Thank you for your fashion advice. I can't believe you're going to a school dance at your age. It's a reunion. And you just went to a middle school Christmas dance, like, two weeks ago. Yeah, but I'm 13 and you're old. Besides, isn't this the same reunion you said you had no interest in, like, three days ago? You're going because of Elle, aren't you? - I'm going because... - Mmhmm. I'm helping a friend and I'm a man of my word. It's okay, Dad. I like her. You haven't gone out with anyone in a long time. I think you should. You do? Of course. And if it's Elle, maybe we can visit her in California and I can get an internship at Zigg. Ah, your diabolical master plan has been revealed. Come on. She's incredibly cool. Yeah. And I like the way you look at her. I think she makes you happy. She's not the only one. Come here! - Aww... Dad! - Come here. I love you, kiddo. I love you too, Dad. Come in. Are you gonna wear these tonight? No. But I do kinda feel like I'm back in high school getting ready for a dance. You'll have fun. You have so much to talk about. Living in the city, your big job. What if all of that went away? What do you mean? I've always felt pressure to achieve and succeed in school and then in work. Striving towards perfection. I've built my whole world around it, my identity. So... what if it goes away? What's left? You know, as a parent you can get caught up in your child's successes as a way to prove to the world that you did a good job. I may be guilty of that. But Noelle, all your father and I ever wanted was for you to know that whatever you set your mind to you could do. We just wanted you to know how capable you are so you could pursue every opportunity. I'm sorry if I pushed you too hard. But I never wanted you to be so caught up in achieving that you miss what's important in life. I just... I don't know what my path forward looks like. I don't know what will make me happy. That's okay. It might be a bumpy road to get there but you will. Thanks Mom. Were you expecting anyone? No. Elle... you look beautiful. Uh... what are you doing here? I was wondering if you'd like to join me at our school dance... 15 years late. I thought I'd go all in on the high school feels and bring you that corsage too. You two have to pose by the tree. Mom. I would be happy to. I feel terrible I couldn't help with the setup today. I had yet another major situation with a client. It never ends. But you know how that goes. Talk about a blast from the past. I am so glad we did this. I have to admit, I'm a bit nervous. I hope this all goes smoothly. Don't worry, I will be right here with you. Uh, I am so sorry, Elle. I really have to take this. Can you hold that thought? I'll, uh, see you inside. Okay. The trees and grass are frosting up There's something in the air... It's cold outside, let's cozy up In your grandfather's favorite chair... Oh, my God! You look amazing. You guys look stunning. Elle Chamberlain for the win. Everyone's having a blast. It really did come together, didn't it? Speaking of coming together... are you here on a date? Oh, um... yeah. So, uh... Kam and I have actually hung out a bit this week and then, um, he asked me to the dance. It's so romantic. Look at you, finally getting everything you wanted. Yeah, I guess so. Um... I gotta take this. I'll be right back. Save me a dance. - Okay. - Okay. No. Hey... Elle? What's wrong? Um, nothing. Everything... everything is fine. Hey. If nothing's wrong then why were you standing outside staring at your phone like you just found out Christmas was cancelled? Zigg is officially over. Everything that I've been working so hard for is gone. No more 35 under 35 list. It's... it's all over. Elle, I am... I am so sorry. But this isn't a reflection of you. It will be. Trust me, in the valley, Zigg will be the butt of every joke and so will I. And the timing? When I'm back here at my old high school, surrounded by everybody who thinks I've become this big success. My resume is how I know who I am. When I, uh, first found out I was gonna be a father... I was in total denial. I mean, I was supposed to be out traveling with my band. The Melody Magicians? The Harmony Wizards. And, um... I had to give that all up. I had to recalibrate. I did not see myself as a parent but I was. It was, uh, it was in there I just didn't know it yet. Because when I held Skylar for the first time and watched her take her first steps and then she called me "Dad".. It just felt like the most right thing in the world. So, having Skylar helped you find yourself? I've never felt more lost in my life. You're not lost. You're just changing directions. Steve Jobs lost his company twice before he had major success. What? What, I read. Devin Ryan, you are continually full of surprises. What are you even doing here? I thought that you weren't interested in reunions. I got a truckload of dusty never-used decorations in there. I'm just here to keep an eye on them, make sure nothing goes wrong. Yeah. Hmm. Can't trust these high school kids. I'm glad you came. I wouldn't wanna miss your big night. Shall we? Hey. Let tonight be magical. Tomorrow's a new day. There you are. I've been looking all over for you. Can I grab you for a minute? There is something very important I need to talk to you about. Um... Devin, can I find you later? Yeah. Come on. I just heard the news about Zigg. Man, what a terrible thing to happen so close to Christmas. But I can help you fix this. What are you talking about? I called my guy who does crisis management. He's the best in the business and he's willing to help you out as a favor to me. The most important thing is to jump on this right away. Protect your reputation. You don't want something like this to derail your career. I can call him right now. No. Thanks Kam, I'll handle this my own way. But not tonight. Tonight is about celebrating and being with friends. Are you sure? More than ever. Okay, your call. Um... so, do you wanna dance? If high school me could see this moment right now, she would be so happy. Great, let's go. You seem like a decent guy, Kam. The kind of guy that anyone looking for someone who cares about perfection and success would be thrilled to find. But I'm not that person anymore. I don't understand. I wanna be the kind of person who takes a chance. A chance on what? On telling someone else that I feel something for them. And for once in my life not doing something that's planned. So... do you think that you might be able to find another dance partner? Oh, I'm good. I'm pretty sure I saw Abbi Ferguson by the bar. Hey. It's speech time. Uh... can it wait? No. We gotta be out of here soon. Okay. Hello? Uh, hi. Can I please have your attention? Welcome back Brookswood class of 2007. I can't believe I am back on this stage. Devin, I'm watching you. I just wanna thank you all so much for working so hard to make this finally happen. We did it. The cursed class is no more. Hey. We're working on the generators, hopefully they'll be up soon. It's really coming down outside. The parking lot is covered. The city should be salting and plowing soon though. So the safest thing for everyone is to hunker down here and wait until it's over? Yeah. We should look for supplies in case it's a long night or the pipes freeze. I have some flashlights in the truck we could grab. Yeah. Okay. Looks like the curse wasn't done with us quite yet. And we were so close. There's something I need to tell you. Yeah. Uh, we don't have to do this right now. You have a lot on your mind already. Yeah. Uh, yeah, it can... it can wait. Okay. This is crazy. There's gotta be some blankets or supplies in one of these rooms. At this point I'd be fine with a breaker switch. Okay, I know we're not students anymore, we're full-on adults. But it still kinda feels like we're not supposed to be in here. Yeah. And I always pictured this room to be way less pathetic. Right? Um, speaking of pathetic... I, um... lost my job tonight. Maybe my whole career. What? Oh Elle, I'm so sorry. Psst! Katie? What are you doing? This spot, recognize it? Yeah. It's our spot. We used to come here every day between fourth and fifth period. Until Principal Holt busted us. Wow. I used to look forward to that moment all day. Me too. I found this tonight when I was getting ready. I haven't worn it in years. What are we doing? I don't know. I remember the old us but who are we now? I think we need to be careful, Jay. Or we're gonna lose what we had- what we have. Yeah, it's like we became work partners and forgot how to be life partners. How do we fix that? We go to Paris. Jay, I'm serious. I am too. We spend the first two weeks of the new year doing something we should've done a long time ago. We focus on us. On our future outside of the office. I love you. Then, now... and always. I love you too. You know, that night at winter formal, I was so jealous of you. You... you were? You got the crown. You were popular and pretty and... I just felt like... nothing. Sam, I... You know, I have spent so much of my life looking for validation from other people. It's exhausting and I don't wanna do that anymore. And neither should you. There you are. Sam... you got it. Got what? Stan's assistant heard from one of the legal associates who saw an email from corporate. You got the job. We're moving to New York! Really? Oh, I can't believe it! Ah! Yay! Ho, ho, ho! No fraternizing on school property. I brought my engineering elves to get the power back on just in the Saint... Nick... of time, it seems. Yeah, we're just gonna... Ho, ho, ho! Crazy kids. Look at you two. Still Brookswood's most epic love story. Like I said, what a difference 15 years makes. No corsage? I need to find Devin. Devin. I don't think I've seen him since he got us the flashlights. I think he might've left. - Hi Dad. - Hey Sky. Uh, just checking in. You doing okay? I'm doing fine. But the school power outage is all over social media. What did you do now, Dad? Ha, ha, ha. No, it's back on now but, um... I'm gonna head home. You're coming home already? That's lame, even for you. Oh, thank you for that. Turns out I was right. Reunions really aren't my thing. Did something happen? Oh, no, honey. It's just sometimes things don't turn out the way you hoped they would. I'll see you soon. Well folks, the storm is finally letting up. The snowplows are out and about and it's time for us to shut things down. So, get home safe everybody and Merry Christmas. Oh, wait, wait, wait. Elle? Uh... hi. Um, please, please don't leave quite yet. You know, reunions are supposed to give us a chance to reminisce and relive the good old days. This week I found myself reflecting more on how I spent the last 15 years. And I realized that no matter how many plans you make or goals you set, you can never fully prepare yourself for what's gonna happen. You can't control it. There will be things that change you inside and out, hopefully for the better. I'm not the same person I was 15 years ago. None of us are. And that is a beautiful thing. 'Cause I can't wait to see what's next for all of us. So, I think this reunion could use one more song, right? Before we all go home to celebrate the holidays with our families. Before we all go off into what's next. And because there's someone special I haven't danced with yet... Devin Ryan. Devin Ryan, please report to the gym immediately. I thought you left. I almost did. Well, I'm glad you didn't because I'm gonna need a ride home tonight. I'm just so grateful that you fell from up above... We're ready now... Thank you. For what? About a million things. This reunion didn't go as planned. At all. But in the end, it couldn't have gone better. It's who we are... We're ready now... We're ready now... We're ready now... Together now... It wouldn't be winter formal without a little surprise. Would it? We can finally be together now. Don't worry, it's just paper. - You made it. - Merry Christmas. My interview with the governor ran long and then my train was delayed. Did I miss anything? No, no. No worries. They're not even here yet. I was about to get us some drinks. What can I get you? I'll have what you're having. Just make it a double. Just a club soda for me. Wait... You guys! I'm so happy for you. You're gonna be great parents. Hey! Hi. Merry Christmas. I just ordered some champagne and one sparkling water because, guys, I have some big news. Liv It Up rentals just got a contract for the biggest event of next year. But the client is very demanding and I'm concerned that she might just drive me crazy. For the rest of my life. We're getting married. Yeah! Congratulations! Hey. A toast. To living our best lives and sharing them with each other. Cheers.
