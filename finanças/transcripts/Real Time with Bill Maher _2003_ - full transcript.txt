Start the clock. ♪ ♪ Right here. Bill: How are you? Thank you very much. How are you? So kind, I appreciate it. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. All righty. [Applause] Thank yo thank you, thank you, thank you. [Cheers and applause] Thank you, I'm so glad you're happy. I don't know why you're happy. Things are going terrible in the country. Did you see this week? Mueller finally came down from his cloud. And spoketh. Everybody has been waiting for them to speak on to testify, and what he said was, word for word, "the report is my testimony." I shall not want. So get off my lawn and stop asking me to testify and do anything. Make do with my cryptic pronouncements. This is what he said. He said -- I love this. "If we had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said that." Okay, so is he a criminal? Why say it that way? What was his wedding like? Do you, Robert, take this woman? I don't not to take her. [Laughter] [Applause] Trump speaks in playground. What did he say? No do overs. I get that. It's a little trickier to say I didn't not find evidence. So you do, don't have to leave it to congress. And when I say do-don't, what I real mean is don't-do. And we just want to know, did Trump work with the Russians? And Mueller is like, you know, it is a little like sex with your ex-girlfriend, who hates you, but you are horny. You wouldn't call it planning, but you both want the same thing thing. [Laughter] [Applause] Thank you for applauding my breakdown. Trump's tweet about this yesterday was priceless. It started with "Russia, Russia, Russia. "President jan Brady, ladies and gentlemen. "Russia, Russia, Russia." This guy, he will deny everything all day, completely admitted on Twitter. "I had nothing to do with Russia helping me to get elected." And then, of course, an hour later, he has to walk it back. No, no, the election wasn't stolen, it fell off a tru. What did I say? But liberals have a new hero, congressman -- republican congressman Justin amash. [Applause] See, liberals love any republican who comes out against us before. We are like a gay guy on grindr who only gets excited by straight guys. [Laughter] But I'm telling you something. Between this Justin amash and Robert Mueller, for what it was, the pro-impeach movement now has mojo. [Applause] No, seriously. You can tell it does because Trump is scared. Trump said the other day, impeach was a dirty, disgusting, filthy word. Don't even get me started on ethics. [Laughter] But yeah, 55 democrats now are for impeachment. Of course, most of the democrats are still saying, hey, impeachment, but what most people care about are the issues. Can you do both? There's 23 of you, divide it up. [Applause] Missouri now has one abortion clinic. Missouri Republicans are going to have to send their mistresses to Illinois. [Laughter] I mean, you can't run on that. Louisiana now got on the abortion bandwagon that is sweeping the nation this last month. They voted in the legislature to ban all abortions, even in case of rape or incest. There was one redneck in the back of the room who stuck up his hand and said, does that include second cousins? [Laughter] Yeah, come on, these people, they are sanctimonious about abortion, but they are running Roy Moore again, in Alabama. Roy Moore wants to run again for the senate. In Alabama, he got a great slogan. It's "when I'm in D.C., I can't fuck your kids." [Applause] Don't get all excited. It looks like even if Roy Moore won, he would not be able to serve s term because the senate is within 1 mile of a school. [Applause] But I've got to tel you, the big policy news that broke today is that Trump has come up with yet another ingenious plan to stop immigration. Tariffs. Tariffs solve everything. Okay. He said if Mexico doesn't stop the immigration coming through the border, also from central America through Mexico, he is going to start putting on tariffs on everything. Starting at 5%, and going up to 25%. This is on Mexican companies and everything Mexico sends here. Okay, so now we are going to build a wall, and taco bell is going to pay for it? [Laughter] That's where we are now? Of course, he never seems to understand, Mexico, or any country, doesn't pay for tariffs. We pay for tariffs. And these tariffs for Mexico, our biggest partners, fruits, vegetables. Not just that, but cars beard this they say will increase the Christ of a new car $1300. Mexico isn't going to pay for the walkure you are going to pay a lot more for that muffler. And, of course, liberals are incensed about this. Not about cars, but do not fuck with the price of avocado toast. All right, we have a great show. Lawrence wilkerson, Kirsten powers, and Jonathan swan are here. We will be speaking with John waters, back is backstage. But first up, the former two-term governor of Massachusetts and is running for the republican nomination for president, 2020, governor William wilde. Hey, how are you, governor? Long time, no see. Bill: Where you want politically incorrect? I was on "politically incorrect." Bill: And where you governor at the time? Bil wow, we had a governor on that show? Interesting. That was a different era. You are a new england republican. You are what I call republican classic. And you are sort of an endangered species. I don't know about that. Bill: Yeah, you are. In the republican party. If you mean decency and integrity, yeah, that is new england republican. Sure, I will plead to that. Bill: How many republican senators are there left? They are not in danger because they are all gone. Bill: It's interesting, because in 2016, he ran as an independent after being a lifelong republican. And you were on the ballot with Gary Johnson. Libertarian. Won almost 5 million votes. I don't know if people remember that. Triple the previous best showing of the party. Gary and I have been two-term republican governors and good friends as fellow republican governors, and we got along very well go. Bill: You don't get the same plane well Ralph nader does. He gets blamed for throwing the election, but 5 million votes, some of those I imagine would have gone to Hillary. Three out of our votes came from Trump appear to libertarian vote is going to be a protest vote for a change vote. Those are not going to go to Mrs. Clinton. Bill: This time, you are running as a republican against Trump, who is in the White House. That's right. Bill: Timing is everything. This seems like it would be the time to run as a third-party candidate. Third party this time, because you're not going to win back the nomination from Trump. Well, let's see. Bill: About land on earth here. [Laughter] Trump has the highest approval rating among Republicans. A hugely higher approval rating among -- in their various states. Bill: Voters. They are voters, but my job is to enlarge the electorate, bring in millennials and the gen gen-xer s. Bill: Do you think the main issue -- [applause] You know what it is? It is really gender equality. It is treating women as carriers, and it is disgraceful. And here's all for for it. [Applause] Bill: Don't yell at me, sweetheart. I'm with you. You're making my point in a kind of way, because it all comes down, every issue comes down to we have to get rid of Trump. The most important thing is to get rid of Trump, wooden running as a third-party candidate -- because that way you do siphon votes off. No, the history of somebody -- I remember pat Buchanan. I was with George hwb a she riding around in the car, pat got only 37% in the New Hampshire primary. It was the beginning of the end for George hw, who earlier had been 91% of the poll for us. Nixon won states before being a year is a long time.Fice. They are beginning to show any tantrum style of the president in Washington. [Applause] Bill: So why were you riding around in my car? I was with George h.W. Bush, trying to help them not be ooked by pat Buchanan. Bill: I see, okay. You were in the car. Okay, so let's say, in a crazy world, you don't get the nomination. And it is Trump again. You have a lot of political experience. How can the democrats avoid losing, because they are so good at that that. What is your biggest advice, just a win? Even the rank and file, who always care about issues -- my advice is to tell the truth. It is aayshe easiest thing to do. That way you don't have to remember what you said. And the truth is that Mr. Trump lives inside his own head, a world all his own. He has a lot of trouble conforming his conduct to the requirements, not just of law -- bill: We know that, we all agree on that. But what is the strategy? Take all of you years of political experience. What is the best path to win? Isn't mayor Pete Pete? Joe biden? A woman? I don't know about the candidates, but I will say the Mueller report they just came out, 1, 000 former federa prosecutors have just signed a letter saying that this man committed a obstruction of justice on multiple occasions, according to the Mueller report. Most of them are career prosecutors, there are only 40 who are like me, confirmed by the senate. So-called political appointees. 1,000 career prosecutors have said that. So you know hcommitted obstruction of justice. I would have charged him, if I had been in Mueller's -- [applause] Bill: Same thing. Let me tell you why. So the constitution says, article one, section three, that are a president remains liable to prosecution and punishment after leaving office. If the president could get reelected, the statute of limitations would run on his crimes of obstruction in '17 and '18. So it has to be the law that you can file a sealed indictment so as not to disturb the president and the conduct of his duties, and have that become public after he has left office. Bill: When you take your case to the republican voter, 90% who are in the Trump camp, that is your big thing? Trump is really in asshole, you've missed it the last four years. Because they love him like a cult. You're going to take your case to the voters bear 90% of them love him. I mean love, love, love -- the electorate I hope to face, I want the millennials, suburban women voters, people in whom it has finally in that the president -- bill: So you are going to go around the base? Oh, absolutely. Bill: Who is left in the republican party? In 20 states, they allow crossover voting. Bill: So you are getting democrats? They don't like any of the 23 they have. I'm having a fund-raiser in Washington, a donkey on one side and republican on the other side, elephant on the other side of the invitation. So no, absolutely. Bill: Let me ask you this question, I have asked people this for over two years. If Trump loses, do you think h will leave? Not voluntarily. Bill: There you go, exactly. Right. No, no. Bill: What is not voluaril what is it? He will have a run at saying it was a rigged game, so on not leaving. I don't think the military and the juste department, rank-and-file, investigative agencies, would stand for that in this country. Bill: [Laughs] But we've said that about everything so far. As he becosore and more a head. That never happened. It is very obvious that he wants to be with the people that grow the company constitution were hell-bent and determined to avoid, which is a king. He loves autocrats, consorts with them, says free press is the enemy of the people -- as in the first amendment. He says that we just can't have these restrictions on me. I'm not going to play. If anybody is investigating me, I'm not even going to engage with congress. What could be a more obvious violation of his oath of office? Bill: I hope when you are president you will come back and see us, won't forget us, because you're too big for it get all right, William weld, everybody. Let's meet our panel. [Cheers and applause] ♪ ♪ Bill: The next president of the United States. All right, he is a national political reporter for axios and is featured on season 2 of "axios on hbo, "mirrors on hbo sundjune 2nd. Jonathan swan. [Applause] She is a CNN political analyst and a columnist for "usa today," Kirsten powers. Great to have you on. [Applause] And he's a distinguished visiting professor at the college of William & Mary and former chief of staff to Colin Powell, Lawrence wilkerson. Pick up where we left off there. I think the debate on impeachment is finally different. I feel different about it. I think a lot of people do. The combination of Mueller, not great as he was, but plus amash, stin amash, I feel like we have always been debating, well, is that the politically right thing or the moral thing? I feel like this is where slavery was in 1858, it is getting harder and harder not to be on the side of the morally right thing. Is that corrt assessment? If you didn't have Nancy pelosi as the current speaker, I think if you had almost any other democrat as speaker, he would already be there. Ill: Eally? Yes. It is only because of the political strength and fortitude of Nancy pelosi and her determination to hold off impeachment that we are not already at impeachment. There is a significant momentum now toward impeachment. The Democratic house. Again, she has the power to basically -- if a committee chair wants to defy her, they're not going to do so. A Jerry nadler and judiciary coitte no way, if she tells him where not doing impeachment, Jerry nadler is not going to stand up with a pitchfork and leave the hordes toward impeachment. Bill: If you like what is different is it is becoming the politically smart thing, whereas -- she doesn't think so. She very firmly doesn't think so. Bill: But that is moving, is it not? I'm glad we found another republican, Justin amash. With some courage. Bill: Plenty of Republicans on TV who ar anti-Trump. Justin amash is a bit of a unicorn in the republican party, let's be honest. He is somebody who has traditionally gone against the republican party, been fighting with Trump since the very beginning. He's a libertarian, so he definitely sticks to those beliefs. I think I'm doing this doesn't tell us anything else about the rest of the Republicans -- I'm working with libertarians right now to get the United States out of this endless war. So the libertarians, in that sense, are the best allies I have right now, in trying to get thenited states to stop fighting everybody in the world with its military. Right, but my point is finding another republican to stand up to Trump -- there are others. Bill: You know of others? Elected people? There are people who are thinking very hard -- who are they? Bill: Yes, who are they? Who are they these people? I cover them all day, tell me the cret I cover them all day in a very different mode. Behind the scenes. But people who will come out, like Justin amash, and challenge the president, and actually say he is going to be impeache that is just not happening. I agree that the leadership of the Democratic party is composed of gutless cowards. They are n like Mitch McConnell, who will stick a knife in your back at any time, and twisted. But there are some people in both parties actually sitting down right now and thinking about what is going to happen. We are having a meeting on the Georgetown campus next week and we are going to talk about four scenarios, and you can name the scenarios yourself, probably. And what we are going to do if those scenarios develop. The plans we will build and so forth in order to deal with -- bill: If Trump doesn't leave? Things like that. Or a contested election, like in 1801 burr and Jefferson. Bill: Could have a dual. [Applause] To me, Justin amash, he had a town hall, and what was eye-opening to a lot of people was this woman who was interviewed after, you may have seen this, but if you haven't, I want to showou. I think this is the heart of the problem, this woman had never heard of anything bad President Trump did. Speaker I was surprised to hear there was anything negative in the Mueller report at all. About President Trump. I hadn't heard that before. And I mainly listen to conservative news. And I hadn't heard anything negative about that report, and President Trump had be exonerated. Bill: Isn't that it come in a nutshell? It has to come -- Nancy pelosi keeps saying, if it doesn't come from the people, but if the people don't hear it -- this woman, Justin amash, republican congressman, finally pried a little air hole in that bubble. And this woman heard it for the first time. I guess my question for you is the political question. You are sit is now politically a good thing to impeach. Bill: I'm saying is moving there. If I got to that point, why do you think that would help democrats get rid of Donald Trump? Bill: Because I've heard a lot about how, if we do impeach, it will rile up his base. His base was born riled. I don't think they can get any more riled up, right? And I don't think they can get any bigger. So I think -- I don't worry about the base being more crazy. I think you do through impeachment. You go back to Watergate. At the beginning, Howard baker would never have said that the process would end the way it did. The process itself reveals so much and brought out so much more. Think about the crimes of Richard Nixon. And then think about the crimes of Donald Trump. This process would be revelatory to the maximum, and you would get all of those independents out there that are going to decide the next election. [Applause] What we saw with that woman underscores the political gift that the Attorney General, bill barr, gave to Donald Trump. People don't remember that. The significance of putting out that summary, and tn f there to be almost a month way that sets what the public absorbs as this report. I mean, there is not a single act I can think of during the Trump administration that has been more politically advantageous to the president and that singlect of putting out that summary. Bill: Right. All right, let me ask about the military, because that is one of your areas of expertise. And something that I never could even imagine as a comedy writer happened this week when we heard that the president's people, he was in Japan, told the Navy to hide a destroyer, the USS John mccain, because our president, this whiny little tch -- [cheers and applause] They call us snowflakes? Couldn't bear to see the name of his dead Nemesis, John mccain, on the ship, and the sailors couldn't watch his speech because John mccain was on the name of their uniform spirit he said he didn't order it, but plainly the people around him -- the shocking thing is the secretary ofefen, the sycophants that he is, military-industrial complex representative that he is, says he didn't know anything about it, and yet, I am hearing that it was pretty much a thing that went around thuilding, and then went to Tokyo. Bill: Yeah, the boat is a trigger for him. Worse than that, if you listen to vice president pce's speech on the plane at west point, and you listen to penn's tell those young men Ando be all over the world, fighting America's wars, in the middle east, in Venezuela, whatever it might be, that was a reprehensible speech in my 75 years on this year's, 70 of which were sent and enough to listen to his speech, I've ever heard. He is a vice predentf the United States at the plane at west point telling all of these people that these wars we have been in now for 18 years aren't going to end back and they are going to be participants in it. This is crazy. Wher are we headed? [Applause] Bill: I'm dying to ask everybody this question. What does the military see in Donald Trump? Why do they like a guy who is a draft dodger, who denigrated the war hero, John mccain, and sides with our enemies. He did it again this week with Kim jong un. What do they see in him? Why the popularity? Why does Trump -- oh, I got the tough people on my side. The polls show the enlisted ranks probably voted in majority for Trump. The officer ranks probably split, more voting for Clinton then voted for Trump. But I tell you t officer ranks didn't like Hillary Clinton because they thought she was a warmonger, too. When you get to the high ranking -- bill: And a woman, to be honest paired >> you are solutely right. The military is still very male-dominated society. I don't know where they are now. We've done some informal polling, and I'm not sure with the military is, but we are very interested and where the military is for this meeting coming up. Bill: Trump floated the idea this week of pardoning more criminals. People who, in Afghanistan, were reported by their own troops, who did heinous things. The back story here -- it's quite a revealing back story. Is that Pete hegseth, who is a host of fox & friends, who Trump had previously considered to be the secretary of the veterans affairs department, he has been talking to Trump privately, I've been told by multiple sources, about this issue. They've been having phone calls about it. Has been campaigning on television about it. That is one of the ways this got onto the president's radar. Bill: Right. And I must say, we have done on dictator checklist. Few times, my I won't go down the whole list again, but it is very scary. Military parades, your family is in the government -- als the thing you brought up at the beginning. The only other country that would happen where they would hide something from a leader because they thought they would freak out by seeing it is a dictator. Those are the only people that would behave that way. Oh, my gosh, we are just too scared of what he might do if he saw the USS John mccain, and so we will hide it. That is just not what you doing democracy. By the same token -- [applause] Can I say something to something? Really come a dictator? He makes a lot of orders that staff just ignore, and they don't happen. If what Trump had said, we would already be out of multiple trade deals. Bill: That's another thing dictators can get away with, being crazy. Truly. But the point I was going to make there, this is another thing dictators do, which is they bribe the security apparatus, you can do whatever you want. You can commit war crimes -- is what he says to the police. You can rough people off. That is how you get the tough people on your side. That is concerning. That is dictatory. [Applause] One of the biggest things he does as a dictator is the way he is creating a spectacle -- she's made the entire government a spectacle. And he makes everything crazy and out of control, the same way thatictators do, so that people will eventually just disengage. They will eventually just say, it is too much, I can't handle it, everybody is crazy. He is trying to just degrade every institution that we have. Bill: It was reported today, it's not confirmed, but south Korean press is reporting that Kim jong un killed the people who were negotiating for him because the negotiations didn't end well when he met Trump in Vietnam earlier this year. That he had them killed. What is the president going to stay about that? Speak of the Kim dynasty, grandfather, father, now Kim jong un, this is their tactic. Bill: But our president. Don't talk too louy. [Laughter] [Applause] Bill: Still have friends that can help me out. Funny stuff. I'm glad William weld was here, because he is 1 of 3 that I count who might be running now on the replica ticket. We have Larry hogan, the governor -- yeah, he's going to be president. Bill: Maryland, he is thinking or challenging. Maybe Justin amash. But all of these guys have one big problem, why they are never going to unseat him. Sorry, Mr. Wilde. To get the republican nomination, you have to go to the right of Trump. You have to be more of a cane fan. They don't have a guy like that in the party, so we made one up. [Applause] Like that woman, they don't really always know what is real, so I think they will just believe it. Governor butch manlys sobody we think or take the nomination, and we would like to show you the campaign ad that we have made for governor butch manly. Announcer: Are you a lifelong republican not sure if you can handle another four years of Trump? Now there's a candidate for those who believe Trump is not republican enough: Governor butch manly. Conservative. Husband. Patriot. Father to sons Reagan and Churchill. Navy seal. Hunter, gatherer. Butch manly is a proud capitalist who made his money inventing a plastic made only for throwing away. Governor manly is author of the Amazon bestselr "what the fuck are you lookin' at?" He's got Reagan's jaw, Roosevelt's balls, and Lincoln's log. Butch manly knows six foreign languages, but ref to speak any of them. He chops wood by shooting it with a rifle and has a confederate statue on his front lawn. Butch manly is staunchly pro-life: He buys eggs at the grocery store and shoves them back inside chickens. I'm butch manly, and I approve Jack shit. [Cheers and applause] Bill: His new book is "Mr. Know-it-all: The tarnished wisdom of a filth elder "." John waters everyone! [Cheers and applause] Bill: How are you? Wait to see you. Thank you. Bill: You look fantastic. You always look the same. I'm trying to be as disreputable as always. Bill: I got to tell you, you are a hero of mine. What are you, 73 now? Yep. [Applause] Bill: It's too young, for v you are still alive applause could kind of insult. Ageism, don't judge people on their age peer people are 95 and still working the fields in some places. You just did acid for the first time. Not the first time. Bill: Last time you were here, you hitchhiked across the country. That's true, I was 66 when I d that. But acid, I hadn't done it in 50 years, and I thought, I had a great time then, so I decided my new start for the book was to take acid at 70 with mink stole, my friend of 50 years. [Applause] Bill: Of course, makes. I had such nostalgia remembering that phlegm in your throat, what it feels like right before you last off. [Laughter] Bill: Don't remember that. You didn't ever trip? Bill: I did, but I didn't have phlegm. Not telling young people to take acid, you have your pussy micro doses. Old people, take it. Bill: You know you love it. Take it today, nobody can say is dementia. You are tripping! [Laughter] [Applause] Bill: You are always fit as a fiddle. You've never canceled a show, right? No, I have never. I've done it with the flu. You know how to do it when you have the time of wiping her nose withaughwhen you're doing a comedy show? It's hard. Bill: You seem to have trouble with phlegm. Everything comes down to that. 2,000 politically incorrect. Never miss a stand-up show, except when the plane couldn't get there. The show must go on. Bill: It's interesting, in your book, you say there is no downside to fame. The only bad thing happen, once I had a kidney stone, the most horrible thing. To go to the doctors and be in the waiting room, to say "Joe waters, what is the matter with you." And you are sitng tre. But if you are famous, you wouldn't have got an appointment in New York City. People come over and say hi when you are eating dinner. You paid for this dinner. Bill: Leave the tape. With this there is fame, and ts fame. But that is the point of famw business, network so hard you can't go out. Bill: Right. In a weird way, you are respectable now. I try not to be. Bill: They say, y kno they can't get rid of you. Old buildings and whores? Sons suddenly becomes respectabe over time. And you are an old whore. I try to keep it up by saying things like I think stormy Daniels lawyer is handsome and will do well in jail. [Laughter] I try to keep up. Saying, basically I try to be daily incorrect and say everything against us is true. We do recruit, there is one, get them! Bill: You're such a great thing going on, because everybody else show business, they go back in time and look at what people did in the past, and oh, that is not politically correct, that is not good enough today. They find things in friends, that shang, homophobic -- the thing is -- bill: But you were always trying, aggressively -- I am politically incorrect. I make fun of things that I love. I'm not mean-spirited paired what we have to do in the next election -- I get why the Trump people like him, because we hate him. But we have to make our opponents not feel stupid, which is what we do. We have to make them feel smart if they are going to change. And that is the difference. Bill: So check them and be able to trick them because they are stupid. [Laughter] I kid, I kid, of course. Should have the mting, all of the Democratic candidates, a secret one, and plot, let's pick two come and all of the rest quit now. Bill: I'm going to get to that. I love your book. Books are for wise people. You are wise. One thing stupid society doesn't get, people get wiser when they get old. Every other society has figured this out. You are talking about your youngerays. Providence town. You still live there? Yeah, yeah, I go there in the summer. 54th summer there appeared to be on what week? Hairy gay men -- bill: They are getting fatter. I saw one, I thought it was a hedge, but it was a person. And when we were tripping, it was bare week, we didn't go out. I couldn't. Bill: When bears are especially welcome to? They have every week there they have gay pilots week. Who ever if that? Anilingus week, that is coming. [Laughter] [Applause] Sorry. It's my job. Bill: It's a big anniversary this week. Famous riot. Stone wall, the [applause] People don't know, there was a gay bar in the village -- one that nobody went to, t was all hustlers and hookers. Bill: That's great. It was the same day Judy garland died. Could there be that gay a day? Bill: The cops had busted this place. It was a mafia bar. Bill: But back then, cops use to rousing gay folks. Drag queens had to have one pair ofen'slothes or they would be arrested paired so they wore Jackie shorts under an evening gown. But they fought back. Bill: You are saying it was because of Judy garland had jus died? I guess they were feeling in a bad mood. Bill: Okay. I hope people of buy your. I noticed this week, with the Mueller report, we were talking about, he had to come out and don't read anymore. Se people if your book does fantastic, it is not going to do it books used to do. But who wants to read that? He didn't say anything. It's like watching the weather, and ey s 50/50 chance of rain. It always will, maybe it won't. Bill: I dug up an old quote of yours, if you go home with someone and they don't have books, don't fuck them. [Cheers and applause] Wisdom, I'm telling you. Wisdom. I have an answer to that now. If you go home with somebody and have books in the bathroom, don't fuck them either. [Laughter] Because that is disgusting. The only good thing about death is we don't have to move our bowels again [laughter] Bill: Let's talk about the presidential race. [Laughter] Speaking of turds. [Cheers and applause] Bill: You know, in years past, , and we said, we shouldnt concentrate so much on the horse race, why can't we talk about the issues more? But the horse race is the issue, I don't care, maybe it is wrong, but I can't look away. Every week, I am in the horse race, because I need to know who is the right person for this Jo? Joe biden, way out ahead. What you think of Joe biden? H needs to not only apologize to Anita hill, he needs to apologize to long John silver. Remember, she had to say that out loud. He made that up. Among drunk silver was a real person, his penis was not,. Bill: I have mixed feelings about Joe, never my favorite, but I keep saying, if he is the one to beat Trump, I'm all in. But I do worry. I do worry. Like I said about age, it is individual. Some people look pretty good. Anthony Quinn look like a leading man at 80. Joe doesn't look good. He looks like he is on a coin. And he was talking to a 10-year-old girl this week. And he said "I bet you are as bright as you are good looking." That is just not -- I worry he is going to say that two days before. Reminds me a lot of George h.W. Bush in his last days. Bill: David Copperfield, right? People forget that. Was close to the end, but George Bush used to grab ass -- senior did. Hw. Bill: Some joke about David Copperfield was okay. I'm a waspy republican, so I can grab your ass. He was the one -- it wasn't lugar, it was Joe biden. So weot to know Joe biden pretty well. While he was versed in the issues and do the issues better than lugar, he often would say some things and do some things that were just utterly weird. Bill: Dick lugar? Sounds like somebody in one of your -- it does. T Trump campaign -- he just passed. Bill: Oh, not like we were trying to make fun. Done a quite a lot of polling in the states that need to win, and they are pretty concerned about biden. He is crushin Trump in the states they need, particularly the rust belt are taking a lot of the voters, working-class. We forget w eay it was at the stage in 2016, Trump hadn't even announced, still fantasizing there's going to be Jeb bush or governor Walker. I think it is a bit of a freeze pattern until the first Democratic debate in late June. You know, there are four or five people that look like they could potentially get the nomination. Bill: What you think about mayor Pete? I like him. That name sounds like buffalo Bob. [Laughter] It's a little whimsical. Bill: The last name, my spell check still doesn't know who he is. I like the idea of a middle of the road, gay president. But I don't know. I hope he gets a running mate, may be like Elijah cummings or even better, al sharpton in drag as Shirley chisholm. Bill: That's not going to happen. Heful now. Ou are not being I'm trying to lighten it up. Bill: He is a veteran. He went to Afghanistan. He is attacking trp on this, I noticed, over and over again, and I think it is working. I don't see Trump saying anything back, which is unlike Donald Trump. Mayor Pete said "rackley, Trump's idea that being sent to fight makes you a medic were criminal -- never served." When he was prering for the seventh season of the apprentice, I was packing my thanks Afghanistan. That is really good. I think that is one thing that could stick to Trump pair they don't care he is a crook, in buyer, each eater, but scared? They took hairdressers and drug addicts first. At w a special one they had for special people. Bill: Does that mean gay? I think it meant gay. I was one where they said, you can't. [Laughter] Bill: No offense, but they made a wise decision. They did. Picture me in a tank. I'm going to put a fly on that argument. I want to agree with you, but I've been involved with groups that are trying to look at how we populate the military. And right now, we've got about 300 million Americans who don't do squat. We've got less than 1% that is bleeding and dying for the others. And I think, though, that seems a powerful argument, that at the end of the day, it isn't. It just washes over most Americans. Most Americans look at the military through a lens of apathy, fear, guilt, and ignorance. Anthey don't want anything but the NFL game with the military out on the field, so they can say thank you for your service and all of that bull shit. And most veterans n't ke that at all. Bill: What I don't get about his followers, the way he sides with people who are not America. What could be more definition of treason -- what? This comes to you from New York. Bill: Trump a message, make Russia great again. Wanted me to give it to you. Bill: The people we say, thank you for your service, they are all telling him one thing, and then he says, no, I'm with this guy, I am with putin. I heard the thank you for your service people, but I'm with Kim on this. What is your take? You showed the woman earlier, most of the people who follow him aren't following any of this. They don't see any of this information, right? And ultimately, the reason they support him has to do is just a couple of issues. It haso do with the supreme court, abortion in particular, and cultural grievances. When you really get down to it, it is really cultural grievances -- increasingly, 68 million Evangelicals -- yeah, it this idea -- they just leave it out. The economy is doing great. Bill: It's doing great for some. Sure. I actually think the economy, I think the idea that they voted him for economic reasons. You look at all of this data, it was driven by cultural grievances and a sense of wanting to go back to the good old days. Right, but what I am saying, when you have the election, stock market never goingo recover, doomsday predictions, and then actually, basically the same, those arguments kind of lose. Bill: I keep rooting for the recession. All right, thank you, panel. Time for "new rules," new rule: Stop telling me we can't use the 25th amendment to remove Trump for being insane. Exhibit 1: These pants. Exhibit 2: There is no exhibit 2. We just circle back to the pants. I don't know what's sadder about this picture, th theresident went to Arlington and his pants fell down, or that he just said, "mommy, this golf course is hard." [Laughter] New rule: Now that the Noah's ark replica in Kentucky is suing its insurance company for rain damage. Farmers has to sell a special "irony" policy. [Applause] Also, read your current policy. It specificalts." [Laughter] New rule: "Sports illustrated" has to quit bragging about its first supermodel in burni. Religion is for sad little men who want to look at women but fear the wrath of god. Whereas the swimsuit issue is for husbands. [Laughter] New rule: Realbotix, from the company that makes realdolls, can't claim that their new robot could pass for human. And wise-asses have to stop saying she could pass for ivanka. That's ridiculous. That's obviously ivanka on the... I'm gonna say "left." [Laughter] New rulenow at climbing mount Everest is so common that you have to wait in line for hours to get your picture taken on the summit, don't expect me to see your life as so different from mine. You climbed Everest? I do rush hour on the 405. [Laughter] [Applause] And finally, new rule: If you're a democrat, the conscience of your party shouldn't be a republican. [Laughter] [Applause] Recent polls show democrats have lost their enthusiasm edge over Republicans, and it's no wonder: They seem to have shed none of the bad habits that hurt them in recent elections - the identity politics, the purity testing, the tty fighting. Losing to Trump should have jolted them into a higher state of seriousness, but it didn't: 23 candidates? That's not a primary, that's an "avengs" movie. [Laughter] Stop worrying about your lien is is. Everyone is focused on their own micro-targeted path from New Hampshire to the iron throne. They've all got their eye on the pizza hut at the end of the game, but no one's playing well enough to earn it. I say it's time we "moneyball" this thing. Democrats need a coach, and this year, I have tried to be that coach. [Laughter] [Applause] On fox news. That is who needs to hear your message. You've got to get in the bubble, man. The audience that is listening to it. Hear the argument. I will go. Great. Bill: Yeah, this has now become an issue for all of the democrats, with many going on fox, but if I am going to be your coach, wait, I have a whistle, too. All these candidates have to remember one thing: "Winning is a habit, unfortunately so is losing." You know who said that? Vince lombardi. And he knew two things Hillary Clinton didn't: How to win, and where Wisconsin is. [Laughter] And that's rule number 1, you've got to go where the votes are. Get out of "wokeville" for a day and see what's going on in "mullet-town." [Laughter] You've got npr. Go on fox! And you can't let Trump completely own the low road. If he's going to call people names, he should get it back. A few weeks ago, when it came out that he lost more money than any other American over a ten-year period, I suggested this. Elizabeth Warren, start calling him brokahontas. [Laughter] [Applause] Brokahontas. And it was just a stupid enough to go viral. Aughter] Rule number 2 is, as far as the 2020 election goes? The sign-up period is over. No more candidates! We're full. [Applause] Will number 3: Democrats, stand up to Twitter! Catering to one contrived outrage after another makes us look weak. Just because wokebabe99 gets mad at you, doesn't mean e re of America gives a crap. It's great you're gender fluid, but most of America thinks gender fluid is what comes outi. [Laughter] [Applause] And for god sake, stop apologizing for everything. I know more about what Democratic candidates have apologized for than I know their stance on the issues. 4: I want all democrats to memorize these two words: Message discipline. Republicans win for two reasons: Teamwork and cheating. [Laughter] And they're really good at both. Democrats snipe and bitch at each other -- they're like that couple that's divorcing but came to the dinner party anyway. Not Republicans: They get and that is something else I have tried to impress upon the candidates. What about if the democrats would call these Trump tariffs -- I heard today, largest tax increase, really, since 1993. Why can't the democrats do what republican do? All get in a room and get a talking point. Something they all say, and call it the Trump tax. I want all of you motherfuckers running for president to say that. Trump tax. All of you. [Cheers and applause] Msnbc sometimes shows a montage of a dozen Republicans saying the exact same thi on certain topic, like "gotcha -- they all said the same thing!" That's not a gotcha, that's how you win! You're afraid that being on messagmakeyou look too much like a politician? Let me tell you something: The millennial vote will not be won through tweeting in emojis or calling your budget plan "fire." They can smell desperation through their phones, so cut the crap and just "do you." Enough with the videos. People want an authority figure as president, not someone who looks like a 10-year-old in the barber's chair. [Laughter] [Applause] Joe biden gets a colonoscopy every year, if he stays the froe going to have to live stream that? From now o no unts! No stones. Like two weeks ago, when congressman Steve Cohen brought kfc into session to remind everyone that bill barr was too chicken, get it, to testify. A picture is worth a thousand words, but none of those words should be "look at that idiot." If you want to bring something nasty and greasy into a house hearing, subpoena Don Jr.! Ok, that's our show. I'll be at the fox theater in Detroit, June 22nd, at the Ruth eckerd hall in clearwater, Florida, August 4th, and at the state theatre in Minneapolis, August 17th.
