(birds and insects chirping) - (woman): So, you've been divorced 3 times? - Yeah, I'm not good at picking the right women. It's hard to know what women want. - Yes, and it's just really... (timer buzzing) Oh! - Time's up. Ladies, please move to your right. You have 4 minutes to make a first impression. - Wait. Can I get your number before you go? - Do you really think we connected? - Well, yeah. Don't you? - I'm sorry. (sigh) - (woman): Excuse me. Rachel. What are you doing? You can't just get up and leave the guy alone. The poor guy's just sitting there, staring at his drink. - Yeah, I'm sorry. You know what? I just don't... I don't feel like I can ever find guys that I actually want to date from these things. - There's some really nice guys here. And cute. There's a really tall guy, Curtis. He's like 6'4". - You do like the tall ones, don't you? - I do. There are guys here that won't cheat on you like John did, and hopefully aren't "commitment-phobes" like Roger. - Yeah. Oh, I always liked Roger. Biggest mistake he made was letting you go. - Why don't you get back in there? Give these guys a chance. Go on a date, get to know him, stop comparing everyone to John. - I don't do that. - A little, you do. - You know that guy Craig? He texted me. - The guy you met online? - Mm-hmm, yeah. He wants to take me out to coffee on Friday. - And? - I think I'm gonna say yes. - Good girl. - Yeah, coffee date sounds nice. - Yeah. - And besides, John never liked going out for coffee. (insects chirping) - Where's that information I asked for on Rachel Malemen? - [I know, I know,] I've had midterms. I had to write a paper for my Information Systems class. It's just been such [a crazy time for me. I just--] - I don't care. I pay you very well to get me what I need quickly. Now, will it be in my hands tomorrow afternoon, or do I need to call someone else? - You will have it 100%, I... I promise. - Good. - man: [Yeah, the truck broke down.] - What do you mean he truck broke down? Where? - [About 10 blocks away.] - Ugh! I don't care if you have to tow the truck to this hotel. I need those flowers in 30 minutes. - [I'll do my best.] - You got a minute? We're all set to go, but I still need the topper for that cake. - Right, I'll get it to you. - [I'll be there in 10 minutes.] - Great, well, it better be, or you'll be hearing from me. OK. - Hey, I'm trying to get the honeymoon suite ready. I need the paperwork. - Right, right, right. All right. Um... - Thank you. - Thank you. OK... (honking) - So, what did the police say? - They said they're done looking because of her Bohemian ways. Maybe she's just run off somewhere. - And you think differently? - Dominique would never go this long without calling. Plus, I've got her phone records and her credit cards, and she hasn't used any of them for a few months. - The last time you spoke to her, she was here in Philadelphia? - That's right. Listen, I know you said you can't take another case right now, but my friend said you're the best. If I don't get my daughter back... my life's never gonna be the same. - When do you go back to Atlanta? - Today. - I'll look into it. - Thank you. - I need you to get me the name and number of the detective that was looking after your daughter's case. - I'll email it to you as soon as I get home. Thank you. - I'll do what I can. - Thank you very much. - It's all good. These two switched up. - And that's fine with the mother of the bride? No issues? - No issues. - OK, all right, great. Um... (message notification) Ugh! I forgot I'm supposed to meet that guy Craig this afternoon for coffee. Uh... nope, I gotta cancel. - What? This late? That's rude. - OK, anything that could go wrong today has. I don't have an hour to get out of here. - Rachel! Do not do what you always do. - Which is what? - You chat with these guys online, agree to meet them, and then you cancel. - No, I don't. - You've done it like 4 times. - Are you counting? - I have no life. - All right, well, I'm sorry, work comes first. - Don't you dare bail on that pour guy last minute. - I can handle this. Thank you. - We all agree here that we need to move forward with the offer, Mother. - I'd like to review this proposal one more time before I say yes. I'll give you an answer tomorrow. Is your brother there yet? - No, not yet. Listen, if we wait too long, we're gonna miss this opportunity. - Oh, one day won't kill us. Besides the hotel's in Aruba. They're all on island time anyway. [If we come back too quickly, we look eager.] - Ryan just walked in. - Hello, Mother. - [Nice of you to finally join us, Ryan.] Craig, if there's nothing else that you'd like to discuss with me, I would like to speak with you and Ryan privately. - We're gonna need the other chairs. - OK, ma'am. - Great. - (man): Don't forget the flash behind the table. - (man): Have Joe bring up the canapés early. (message notification) - [OK, Craig,] about this Aruba proposal... I am really hoping that you did your homework. I don't like doing business in the Caribbean. - Why is that, Mommy? Is it because of the pirates? - You know, Ryan, that's so humorous. Considering how hard [your grandfather worked to make this business] [into what it is today,] it's nice to know you do not take anything seriously. - Look, Mom, things have really changed down there. Their political climate [is better than it ever has been, and look how] profitable Ocho Rios has been for us. You gotta trust me on this one. - You don't run this company, Craig, not yet. I do. [By the way, did you ever follow up] and call that beautiful Greek girl Alena? [You know her father is one of the biggest shipping magnates in the Mediterranean?] - Uh, no, Mom, I didn't, because I've actually met someone else. Her name's Rachel. - Oh. Well, I hope she's nothing like that Dominique. [So, what does this Rachel do?] - She's a senior event coordinator at one of the big hotels here in Philly. And before he passed away, her father was a cardiologist. - Really? Oh, a cardiologist. - [Yes. I'm on my way to see her] right now, so I've gotta go. Can I call you later? - [OK.] Bye, darling. Good luck on your date. - Bye, Mom. I hate her, man. Look, why don't you just marry someone she approves of, and then we can just be done with this whole thing? - Because I told you already, I'm not gonna marry someone she picks just to get control of the company. I want it to be someone that I'm actually in love with. I mean, you have that with Tasha. I want it too. - Fair enough. So... where did you meet this woman? - We met online. I mean, well, I haven't even met her yet. We've just been Skyping and chatting, but if she's everything that I think she is, I mean, she's gonna be amazing. And Mom will adore her. - Yeah, I hope so. Look, I gotta swing by the house tonight, pick up the keys to the boat. Is that cool? - Yeah, sure. - Great. Stay in charge. - Yeah, thanks for dropping by. - Yeah, thanks. (cell phone ringing) Please tell me I did not ruin your day by cancelling this late. - Ruin my day? Broke my heart. - Stop. That's not making me feel any better. - (laughing): I'm kidding. However, I am getting the feeling you don't want to have a simple coffee with me. - No, it... it's not that. It's just, I have a wedding at the hotel tonight, [and I swear this thing is jinxed.] - Oh, it sounds like you could use something a little stronger than coffee. - Yeah, well, if a bottle of champagne turns up missing later, you'll know why. Listen, why don't we reschedule for Monday? And again, I am sorry about being a flake. - That's OK. I've got the feeling you're worth waiting for. - That's sweet. Thank you. - Listen, call me over the weekend and we'll figure it out. - I will, I promise. - Great. Bye now. - Bye. (sigh) Flowers. - Oh wow, you look stressed. - Yeah, did you know about the vegetarian requests for the wedding today? - No. - Yeah, me neither. I just got off the phone with the bride's father. Apparently, we need 14. And please, do not give me pasta. - I forgot how beautiful you are when you're demanding. - Don't patronize me. I am not in the mood. Can you do it or not? - You can trust me. - Yeah, as long as you're not halfway into a bottle of scotch. - Really? You're gonna go there right after you've asked me for a favour? - I'm sorry. It's been one of those days. I appreciate you changing the menu last minute. - No problem. - So, no arrests, doesn't own any property. Rachel's last known address was in Hammond Park. That house there belongs to a guy named John Anderson. He still lives there. I'm guessing it's an ex-boyfriend. He also works at the same hotel, so... - What does he do there? - He's the head of food and beverages. - What does he look like? - Oh, I got a picture somewhere. - What's all that? (He clears his throat.) - My slaves. - Your what? - Not slaves the way you think. They're just 2 of the girls that I watch. I have complete control of their computers - emails, files. I can even turn on their webcams without them noticing. I know, this time of the day is kind of boring. But it gets really good when they're getting dressed in the morning. - And they don't suspect anything? - No. I mean, if I went in and messed with the stuff on their desktop, they might, but... Anyway, if you need more info on John Anderson, I can get that for you. - Yeah, yeah, I want a lot more info on him. ♪♪♪ (instrumental music) - Rachel. One of the waiters said this is for you, from someone in the bar. What's it say? - Uh... I need to go to the bar for a few minutes. Um... how's it coming with the cake and coffee? - Good. Cake's been plated for half an hour. - Great. Can you keep an eye on things for me? - Sure. - Great. And if there's any problems, you'll call me on my cell? - You bet. ♪♪♪ (light jazz music playing) - Finally meet in person. - I thought we'd decided to wait until Monday for coffee. - Yes, that was true, but - please, sit. - Thank you. - Then I got to thinking, and I realized that, uh, I couldn't take the risk. - Risk? - Of someone coming along and snapping you up over the weekend. - Highly unlikely. (She laughs.) - Wedding cake. - I thought you might be hungry. - Do, uh, the bride and groom know we're celebrating with them? - No. - What are their names? - Rick and Michelle, and they are blissfully unaware that I have even left the room. - Well, then... to Rick and Michelle's eternal happiness, and to finally meeting you in person. After, what, chatting online for 4 weeks? I was running out of things to talk about. I don't know about you, but... (both laughing) Cheers, Rachel. - Cheers. - How are you liking it? - Sorry. Hey, do you have the wine I asked for? - Yeah. - Thanks. - Here you go. - Great. Thanks so much. Everything is good? - Everything's good. - All right, talk to you later. - Take care. - Bye. ♪♪♪ (instrumental music) - Hey. - Hey. (applause) - Is, uh, Rachel still here? - No, she had to run upstairs for a few. I can call her if you like. - Hey, did she, uh, say who she was meeting? - Nope. - You know, don't worry about it. Thanks, man. - The bride and groom go to cut into their cake - the photographer's there, everybody's waiting, the big ooh and ah moment, right? Every layer is Styrofoam. - What?! (She laughs.) Oh. - The bakery sent over the window display. - Genius. (both laughing) (cell phone vibrating) - Oh. I'm sorry, I am on call. - Please. - OK. Hello? - Hey, uh, where are you? I'm near the ballroom. I can't find you. - Oh, uh, is there a problem? - Yeah, the father of the bride asked where you were. - Oh, um, OK, I'll be right there. - [OK.] - Thanks. Bye. Sorry. - You're needed? - I am. Um, how about this? Can you give me an hour? - Tell you what, you go and do whatever it is you have to do, but tomorrow night, I'll take you out for a real date. Deal? - Deal. - And no calling at the last minute to cancel, thank you very much. - I swear. - All right, go and put out the fire. - OK. Thank you for the champagne. - Well, thank you for the wedding cake. - Mm-hmm. Good night. - Oh, sorry. I took care of it. Uh, the father of the bride had a question about the coffee. - Oh, OK. Thanks. What are you doing here so late? - Oh, I just had some paperwork to do. I thought I'd check up on you. So, you want to grab a drink or something? Things seem to be winding down here. (She sighs.) - John, why do you always do this? - Do what? Try to be friends with you? - Yeah, except for you haven't been able to be friends since we broke up. You know, all of our happy hours turn into you convincing me why I should come back. - OK, I didn't realize that. - If you want to be friends, we can be, but that's all it's ever going to be. I just want to make myself clear again. - OK, if you don't have feelings for me... that's fine. You know, but I think you do. Am I wrong? - This is exactly why we shouldn't have a drink. I need to get back in there. I'll see you on Monday. - The girl who lives next door... that doesn't live next door. Rachel Miller. Rachel and Craig Miller. Rachel... Mr. and Mrs. Miller. Mr. and Mrs. Miller. (He sighs.) You are so beautiful. - Good morning! - Hi. - Ooh, thanks. - What are you smiling at? That guy Craig text you? - Mm-hmm. Look. He sent me flowers! - Oh, adorable. Major points. So, you like him, right? - Mm-hmm. - He obviously likes you. - I don't know. He's different than most guys, you know? He's easy to be around, he's fun, spontaneous. - So, the complete opposite of John. - Yeah. OK, so, I got home from work last night, he Skyped me, and he's taking me out tonight. - Oh, a real date. - Mm-hmm! - Where? - He said he wants it to be a surprise. - Aw. - Mm-hmm. - (Craig): So, I take another lap around the bar, and I still can't find her. She'd been sitting right there. I walked past her 3 times. And I'm thinking, "Where is she?" (Rachel laughs.) - (Rachel): You're kidding. - No, no, I am not kidding. I didn't even recognize her. Turns out, all of her photos were like 10 years old. - What? No, come on. Two, maybe. - No, she had one with her son. He looked about 7 or 8. So, I asked what grade he was in. You know what she said? - What? - Freshman. College. - Wha? That's awful! - Ah, I'm telling you, you women lie on these websites. - Oh, us women? Yeah, well, you guys lie too. - Mmm... - No, you do, and it's always about your height. If you say that you're 5'11", well, that means you're 5'9". If you say that you're 5'9", 5'7". - Really? So, it's always 2 inches? - Yeah, yeah. Well, unless they reach 6 feet. Then I guess if they're 6 feet tall, they feel like they don't need to lie about their height. - I'm sorry, sir, he's not here right now. - When do you expect him back? - I don't know what time he'll be back. Good evening, sir. - Hi. - This gentleman, he's asking for... (She sighs.) - It's OK, Maria, I'll take care of it. - You're Ryan Miller, Craig's brother? - Yeah, how do you know that? - Jerry, Jerry Berman. I'm a private investigator. - What's this about? - (Rachel): So, where are we going? - (Craig): Well, you're gonna see in about 10 seconds. - This is Michel Malefant's new restaurant. - Yeah, you know him? - Well, yeah - no, no, I know of him. Is it even open? Doesn't look like there's anyone here. - Well, the valet's here, so it must be open. Well, for our first real date, I thought it might be nice if we had a little privacy. - You rented out the entire place? - Michel. Rachel, this is my friend Michel. - Mr. Malefant, what a pleasure. - Charmed to meet you. I hope you like what I've prepared for you this evening. Please, this way. - After you. - You are absolutely insane. - You know a woman named Dominique Ranton? - Um... yeah, a long time ago. She was... I think Craig dated her. - When's the last time you saw her? - Uh... ♪♪♪ - Oh, everything is so delicious I want to just keep on eating. - Well, you've got to save room for dessert. - Oh. Yeah, I have no willpower. - Oh, why, thank you. I have that effect on women. (She laughs.) (cell phone vibrating) Um, will you excuse me for a second? It's my brother. He keeps calling. It might be something important. - No, of course. - Sorry. - Don't worry. - Craig: [Hey, what's up?] - Where are you? I tried calling you 3 times. - I'm on my date with Rachel. What's so important? - [I went by your house] to get the keys, and there was a private investigator there. - What did he want? - [He wanted to know] where Dominique is. He said her father hired him to find her. - What did you say? - Come on, I told him the same thing I told the police. - Good. - [Yeah, well, he's] coming by your house tomorrow to speak to you directly. - It's fine. I'll handle it. - You'd better. I am so sorry. There's always some sort of crisis with him. - No problem. - Now, what were we talking about? - Um... I don't even know what to say. I mean, this whole date is like something off The Bachelor. - Oh, well, that's where I get all my good ideas. (She laughs.) - Good to know. I mean, you must have been so impressed that I looked like my pictures. - Actually, it had a little more to do with the time we spent last night at the hotel. I could have just sat there and talked to you for hours. - Me too. (door opening) - (whispering): Dessert. - Oh. - Voila. - Ah, looks beautiful. - Please... - Thank you, Michel. - ...let me know what you think. - OK. (laughing) - I am no expert in desserts, huh? - Styrofoam! That is too funny! (laughing) - I bring you the real dessert now. It's a chocolate tart with raspberries and cream - no Styrofoam, I promise. - That sounds divine.

But first, I finished filling out both of our forms for the British Supersport race. I just need you to sign yours. Right there, babe. So, how's Craig? (He sighs.) What? Did you guys get into it or something? - No, he, uh, he wasn't home. He went out on a date with a woman that he met online. - Really? - Yeah. - Well, that's good, isn't it? - It's great. You know he's taking her up to meet Mom and he barely knows her? - You're lucky you're not the golden child. You don't have to deal with all that BS about the family legacy. - I guess. You know, I just wish he'd just play the game, just marry someone in the right social circle, and then divorce her later. - Will you give him some credit? He doesn't want to marry somebody he can't even stand. - Mmm. You know, it's just the ones he chooses. She's never gonna approve. - Hopefully this time will be different. - You know, once he's in charge, I'm gonna tell her to go live on her exotic island and just shrivel up and die. (She chuckles.) - So? How was it? - Unbelievable. (Rachel laughs.) He rented out the entire restaurant. - What?! - Yes, no, seriously. It was amazing. And the food... (Rachel gasps.) Oh! - Oh, my god. (vehicle honking) Nice flowers. - Look at the note. - "Happy Monday. Craig." Craig? Craig Craig? - Yeah! - Wow. - Aren't they beautiful? - They are.

It's the, uh, labour for the Everett wedding. - Oh, great. Thanks. - So, uh... where'd those come from? - Um, from a client. Just a thank you. They're gorgeous, huh? - Yeah, yeah. It's, um... uncanny coincidence that they managed to guess your favourite flower. - I guess. - Only one person ordered a bottle of champagne that Friday night. Credit card belonged to Craig Miller. Do you want me to print you a copy? - Please. Thank you, Elise. That's him, all right. - This guy's got a temper. He was arrested for assaulting his girlfriend about 10 years ago. - Did he plead out? - Nope. Charges were dropped. His girlfriend recounted her statement. Times have changed. Back then, if a victim refused to press charges, there was nothing we could do. - Same as Atlanta. No arrests since. Off the record... could he be responsible for Dominique Ranton's disappearance? - Honestly, it's a tough one. I mean, you're an ex-cop; you know that when a woman disappears after a breakup, it's almost always her ex. - About 90% of the cases I worked. - Yeah, but on the other hand, there was no sign of foul play, and this girl's a drifter. I mean, maybe she was one of the 10% that just up and left. - Except for one thing: even when she drifted, she never stopped using her cell or her credit card, especially the one her father paid the account on. - I agree, but we explored every avenue. Dead ends. (He sighs.) Hopefully you'll pick up on something we didn't. - My gut tells me that Craig Miller knows more than he's letting on. - Anyway, if there's anything I could help you with, just let me know, OK? I mean it. - Well, thanks, Detective. (phone ringing) (She sighs.) - Craig, I've had a change of plans. I think I'll fly home to Philadelphia next month. I can't wait to meet this Rachel girl of yours. - Yeah, and I know you're gonna love her, Mom. - OK, darling, I'll talk to you soon. - All right. Goodbye! - [Bye.] I know she's the right one. Yeah, Dominique and I went out a few times. Nice girl. - Have you got any idea where she would go where she wouldn't need credit cards or her cell phone? - Mm, she, uh, did mention she was thinking of visiting some friends in Maine, but... that was the last time I spoke to her. - Uh-huh. Dominique just seems to go where the wind takes her, yeah? Ah... - I've got it. These high-spirited types can be difficult to get along with, especially for someone who likes things to be a certain way. - Why don't you just ask me what you're dying to know, Mr. Berman? - I thought I did. Is there anything you want to tell me to move this conversation along? - I don't know where Dominique is. We parted ways amicably. - How about with Melissa, the one that called the cops and said you hit her? Was that... amicable too? - Good luck finding Dominique. Can I show you out? - Well, it is a big house. But I think I can find my way. - So, that's just it? We're over? This has to do with your mother, doesn't it? She doesn't like me. - It's more complicated than that, Dominique. - When are you gonna stand up to that woman? Hey? You've been under her thumb your whole life like some pathetic little puppet. - Domi, please, just go. - I knew you were gonna do this. Well, um... you may think you can just... throw me away, but it's not gonna be that easy. I'm pregnant. I wonder what your mom's gonna have to say about that. - You're lying. - I'm lying? Fine. We'll take a test, right here, right now... Daddy. - Well, that's impossible, because you said you were on the pill. - I was. Things happen. - Wow. Aren't you the manipulative little bitch? You stopped taking it on purpose, didn't you? - No, I didn't. - Yes, you did, because you wanted to get pregnant so that you could tie yourself to me and my family. - You're delusional. - No, you're delusional. - No, you're delusional! - I should have known that you would pull something like this. God! - I wonder what your mommy will say now. Maybe you'll finally have to stand up to her. If you can. You're weak. You're pathetic. You're not a real man. A real man stands up for the woman he loves. But not you. Not you, Craig Miller. (Dominique crying out) (glass breaking) - (Maria): Mr. Miller? - It's fine, Maria. - Mr. Miller, what happened? - It was just... stupid. Just an accident. - Yeah, I like it better like this. More condensed. We don't need the centre aisle. Thank you. Oh, hey. - Hey. - What's up? - Ah, not much. - OK. Oh, I need this. - Oh, I, uh... Last night, I drove by that little Mexican place, you know, that we used to always go to. - Uh-huh? - You know what, and it struck me, um, it's a been a long time since we went. - Is there a point? - Oh, no, I just thought that maybe, uh... maybe we could go out for dinner tomorrow night. - Ah. - Catch up, chat, knock back a couple of pitchers of margaritas. - You never give up, do you? - Well, I'm the kind of guy who goes after what he wants. You used to like that about me, remember? - Yeah, I also remember you saying you would never cheat on me. - Look... how many times do you need to hear that I made a mistake? I mean, I'll tell you a hundred more if you'd like. But just let me do it over dinner. You know, a couple of top-shelf tequila shots and some fried ice cream. Come on. Look, it's only dinner. And I promise I will not try to take advantage of you. Even if you beg me. - Oh! You. - Mm? - Fine. An early dinner. - OK. - Are you gonna tell Craig you're having dinner with John? - Um... I don't know. Why would he care? - Because he's your ex, and he clearly wants you back. And you kind of still have a thing for him. - No, I don't. - Then why are you having dinner with him? - Um, because I feel like I owe it to him. - You don't owe him anything. - I don't know. It's just... I feel like there's this door that's not closed, you know? And if I'm gonna fully move forward with Craig, then I think I need to resolve things with John. I mean, 3 and a half years is a long time, and those feelings don't just go away, even though he hurt me. - Yeah. Ah, just water for me. - What? - Yeah. At least, for the next 7 months. - What? Oh, my god! You're pregnant? - Roger was just as surprised as you are. - Oh, my god. Congratulations. I mean, wait, is... are you and Roger getting back together? - Um... yeah, not sure about that just yet. What I am sure about is no wine. So... (squealing with delight) - Ohhh, a little bambino! - (woman): And, uh, so, half an hour... - Hey, how are you? - [Real quick. I'm about to run] [into a meeting, but my dinner got cancelled] tonight. Do you want to come over to the house for a barbecue? It's supposed to be a beautiful evening. - Um, I can't. I actually have an early dinner with clients. Uh, but hey, why don't I come over afterwards, we have dessert, and make a fire? - Yeah, uh, sure. Say around 8ish? - Sounds great. - Great. See you then. Early dinner with clients. - Um, just to the... - Yeah. Oh, right. - Ah. There we go. So? - So? - OK, what's it gonna take, Rach? To get you to come back. I still love and care about you. I know I hurt you. - It's complicated right now. - Why? Because you're not sure if you love me anymore, or because you're seeing someone else? - Both. - I know. I know, you're seeing that guy, uh... Craig. - How did you know? - I saw the two of you at the bar together, then your favourite tulips. It wasn't hard to put 2 and 2 together. - So, that's what this is about. You're trying to get me back before I move on. - Look, in case you've missed the signs, I've been trying to get you back since we broke up. - Yeah, you have. - Look, I'm not some rich trust-fund baby. I'm not gonna be able to buy you diamonds and cars and all that. But you've never been the kind of woman who needs all that crap. You're so much... better than that. I can promise you that no guy is going to love you as much as me. And I won't make the same mistake twice. - Thank you. - My pleasure. I'll walk you out. - OK. - Oh, well... Hm. So, um... just think about what I said, OK? - I will. - Well, good night. - Good night. - (John): See you soon. - (Rachel): OK. (sigh) (cell phone ringing) - Hey, hon. Done with your dinner? - Hey. Yeah, um... but halfway through I... yeah, I started not feeling very well, so... [uh, would you... would you mind if we rescheduled for tomorrow night? I've got] that big tradeshow tomorrow morning, and I feel like I need to get some rest. - Yeah, of course. Uh, you want me to come over and bring you some medicine? - Oh, no, no, that's sweet. Thank you so much. Uh, Laura's got a bunch of stuff at the condo. - Oh. OK. Well, feel better. - Thanks. OK, talk to you soon. Bye. - Good night. - Being with him tonight, I felt all of the old things I used to feel with him. And, like, the chemistry was still there. - No, there's a history there. After 3 years, of course it's going to seem comfortable and familiar. But don't forget how it felt when he got drunk at that convention and slept with some woman. - Hm. Horrible. You're right. But you know what? He swears that he regrets it. - Oh, I'm sure he does, but can you ever really trust him again? I mean, every convention he goes to alone, you're gonna be lying in bed wondering. - Oh, you're right, you are absolutely right. And I don't have to worry about that with Craig. I mean, he's amazing, and I trust him completely. (phone ringing) - Hey, man. What's up? - Remember that webcam thing you showed me? - [Yeah.] - Do you need access to their physical computer to do it? - No, I just get them to click on a fake link, and the software installs automatically. - I need you to do something for me. - Yeah, sure. What's up? - I need you to bug Rachel's computer. Can you do that? - [Sure.] ♪♪♪ (dance music playing) - I can't help but feel a little responsible for what happened. - For Dominique's disappearance? Why? - Well, if I hadn't lied to the cops to keep him from going to jail, maybe he would have been forced to get therapy or something. - What happened that night? - We got into an argument. I don't remember what it was over. Something stupid. And he punched me. Twice. - Why did you change your mind about pressing charges? - Craig called me the next morning from jail, offered me $50,000 to say I'd made the story up because I was mad. I took it. - Two hundred... (message notification) - Did you continue seeing him? - I signed the agreement, the money was wired to my account the next day, and I never talked to him again. I was glad to be away from him. He was so controlling. - Controlling? How? Jealous? - Incredibly. I mean, 6 months in, I found out that he'd been following me, opening my mail, deleting phone messages from my male friends. - Rachel, have you given any thought to what I told you the night... - "...we went to dinner? I'm not trying to be a pest, but like I said, I still love you and I'm not giving up." (glass breaking) This guy, John Anderson, he's behind it. - All right, I thought that her father hired the detective. - No, it was this guy. He was friends with Dominique, and he knows about us. - So, what are we gonna do? - I think you know what we have to do. ♪♪♪ (light jazz music playing) - Rachel, this is my mother. - Hi. - I am so happy to finally meet you. - Likewise. - And this is my brother Ryan and his wife Tasha. - Nice to meet you. - We've heard so much about you. - Nice to meet you. - Oh, likewise. Nice to meet you guys. - Champagne, Maria, please. - (Maria): Yes, ma'am. - Great, thank you. - So, Craig tells me that you, um, do event planning at a hotel downtown? - Not just any hotel; one of the biggest in the city. - Ah. - That must keep you really busy. - Come and sit. - Oh, yes. - OK, excuse me. I'm just gonna wash my hands, Mother. - So, what kind of a degree do you have, Rachel? - Uh, well, you can get a degree in event planning, but I didn't. I got mine in hotel management, and then I went on for my MBA. - Ah, didn't I tell you she was brilliant? - Yes, you did. And so beautiful. - Phew... - So, Craig tells me that you recently bought a flat in London? - I did, yes. I just love London - the people, the history. You know, when the boys were young, their father and I would go away to Europe at least once a month. We just loved it. - Oh, how fun. - I am sorry. I have to go meet the alarm company at the shop. - I'll go with you. - It's OK, honey, I got it. All right? I'll be back in less than an hour. - Hey, hurry back, huh? - Yes. - Did you grow up around here? - I did. I was born in Ohio. - Don't worry, I'll shield you from Mother while he's gone. - (Rachel): ...so most of my living family is still back in the West. - (Mrs. Miller): Oh, that is so interesting. (doorbell) - Hi, can I help you? - Are you John Anderson? - Yeah. W-What do you want? (two gunshots) - I was 14 and naive. - Oh. That's great. Interesting. - That's where we met. - So, what do you think of her? - She's wonderful. - What the hell? - Hey, there he is. - Hey, babe. - Whew... - Is everything OK? - Yep. Um... as predicted, it was a false alarm. - Good. Maria, can we get Ryan a little bit of dinner, please? - Yes, sir. - Yeah. - I love your mother. She's amazing. - She is something else. - OK, so, wait a minute, wait a minute. I have a question. All of those stories that she was saying about you being a kid, were those true, or embellished? - My mother has no idea what I did as a kid. I barely knew her from the ages of 6 to 13. God, you are beautiful. - Wait, what? Why not? - Because she put me in boarding school 7 miles from our house. - Ryan too? - No, Ryan got a nanny. - I don't understand. - Well, when I was 5, they decided that I was gifted. - Mmm. - So, my mother put me in boarding school because she thought it would help with my education - and help me focus on becoming a genius. (laughing) There was very little hope that Ryan would be one. (She laughs.) - Ohhh, that's sad, though. I mean, that must have been hard for you, being so close. It must have felt like she didn't want you around. - Can we please talk about my mother some other time? Because all I can think about right now... is locking you in this room... - Mm-hmm. - ...and never... letting... you go. - Mm-hmm. All right. - Checking in? Name, please? - (Rachel): So, what happened? - Well, he's supposed to meet Marco for that big event tonight, and he never showed up. And he isn't answering his phone. - That's weird. That's not like him at all. - Mm. - You know, I still have the key to his place. I could go check on him. - Yeah, go for it. - John? Hello? Are you home? John? John? John?! (gasp) John! - Yeah, I need some police tape over here. - [OK.] (police radio chatter) - (man): ...the CSI guys... - Rachel. - Craig. - Are you OK? Look at me. Look at me. Are you OK? What happened? Do they know what happened? - They don't know anything. They think that... that somebody tried to rob him and that he confronted them and... - Oh, God, baby, I'm so sorry. It's gonna be OK. - Why did you lie to me?! You said that guy knew Dominique. You said that guy was gonna take us down. That guy is Rachel's ex! - It was either him or us. - Him or us? I killed the guy! - He was trying to take Rachel away from me, and I couldn't let that happen, OK? She's the one. And Mother loves her. Just trust me. Now that he is out of the way, everything is gonna be perfect. We are gonna get exactly what we want. You did good. - Yeah, I did good. You're scaring me, man. - I missed you so much. - Yeah, I know, me too. I know you had a tough couple of weeks, huh? Next time I got to LA, I want you to skip work and come with me. - Mmm, I'd like that. - Good. - What? - I didn't say anything. - It's a superhero convention. (laughing) What am I gonna do? - Thank you, pal. How about a nice hand for my assistant? (applause) All right, moving on to the next trick, we're gonna need another lovely assistant. - What do you think? - Um, I think this is hands down the best gelato I've ever had since... well, I would say since Italy, but I've never been there, so... (She laughs.) - And we're gonna do something very exciting and a little bit dangerous. That doesn't worry you, right? You're not scared or anything, are ya? - A little bit scared. - OK, wait till I tell ya what we're gonna do. - Oh, hey, check it out. A street magician. - What? No way. - Here, come on, let's check it out. I've always loved magic. - Me too, since I was a kid. - So, what we're gonna do is we're gonna take this very sharp and very pointy sword, and we are gonna jab it right through her throat, and sometimes it gets stuck, so... there we go. All right... Going through the muscle at the back there. There we go. Ow! Bingo! Now, if I could get you to stand up. As you folks can see, the knife is all the way through her throat. Come on, folks! (applause) Let's take this out here. Now we're gonna try... Pull that out of there very gingerly... and as you can see as well, which is a relief, there is no blood on the sword, which is always a good sign. And there we go. How about a nice hand for my assistant Maya? - Yeah! - Thank you, Maya! - All right! Woo! - All right, we need another beautiful assistant. How about you? - But I... - Come on, a nice hand for my assistant, everybody! A nice hand for my assistant. Thank you. Whose name is...? - Rachel. - Rachel. It's very nice to meet you, Rachel. My name is Luigi. - Nice to meet you, Luigi. - Now, what we're going to do, Rachel, I'm going to show you a trick called the magic box trick. Now, you show everyone around that the box, completely empty. You can see my hand going all the way through the box. And we'll put that back on here. And I'm also gonna pick up the magic cylinder. As you can also see, you can see, Rachel, there is nothing in the cylinder. I can put my hand all the way through it. And if this all works out, there should be something very special in here for you, all right? You ready? - Yes. - Here we go. One, two, three! Let's take a look... and sure enough... ah, it was sticking... Ah. Huh. Well, look at that. (crowd oohing) Now, would there be anyone here, maybe, who has a question for Rachel? Maybe something ring related? - I do! - (laughing): What? - Rachel, you bring magic to my life. And I want to spend every day with you. Will you marry me? - Yes. - He can't hear you up there. - Oh, uh, yes! Yes! I'll marry you! - How about a nice hand for the happy couple? All right! - (man): Congratulations! - (woman): So romantic! (applause) - (woman): Congratulations. - He proposed? - Isn't it awesome? - It's gorgeous. - And the way he did it, ah, so cool. Huh? - Wow. - OK, so, I have a question for you. - Yes? - Will you be my maid of honour? - Of course! Of course. - Yay! - No? - Mm, I don't want it too, like, crazy, but I want it to be... Wow. Wow. That's what I want it to be. I want it to be wow. Look at this. It's stunning, right? - Mm-hmm. - Look at that. Ah. And the neckline. It's... sweet. - But not too sweet. - Hello. - What? Honey! (laughing) - Mwah! - Hey! What are you doing here? I thought you had a meeting. - Well, I pushed my meeting so that I could come and help you pick out your dress. Hi, Laura. - Hi. - Yeah, right. You know it's bad luck to see the dress before the wedding. - Well, that is a silly old custom, isn't it? - You're joking, right? - Yeah, I just want to be involved. That is OK, isn't it, ladies? - You're totally kidding, right? - Are you serious? - Yeah, I'm serious. Come on, show me what you've got. I've got a couple hours before the meeting. - Um... O-OK. Um... yeah. Ta-da! What do you think? Isn't it stunning? - Yeah, I like it. I mean, it's a little old-fashioned, isn't it? - No. Laura, is this old-fashioned? - No, it's perfect. - OK, hello. Honey, not old-fashioned. - Wait a second. What about something more like this? - (Laura): It's a cocktail dress. - Yeah. No, honey, I think that's more for a younger bride. - Well, I don't think there are any rules, are there? I mean, God, it's gorgeous. Just... will you please just try it on? - (Rachel): All right, good? - (Laura): Yep. - (Rachel): OK. - Wow. That is perfect. God, it's amazing. - Really? - Yeah. Will you put the veil on? - Oh. - Maybe you should try on a few other styles just to see. - Yeah, yeah. - You look beautiful. I cannot wait to see you walk down the aisle in that. I think we've made our decision. Miss? I think we've made our decision. It looks gorgeous. - [It's Jerry.] - Yeah, I wasn't sure when I'd hear from you. - I just got back. Found out Miller got engaged. - What? - I've got an idea. - Well, what is it? - Why? - I don't know. Look, Craig's a little obsessed with details. I mean, there are worse things than a husband wanting to help plan his own wedding, right? - Yeah, OK. So, is he like that in other ways too? - Um... sometimes. But, you know, everybody's got their faults, and if I don't like something, obviously I would say it. I mean, I'm not a pushover. - I know you're not a pushover. That's... So, you really are happy with your dress? - I am. - OK. - I am. I think it's gonna be really pretty. All right, now, enough about me and my dress. Let's go get your bride's maid dress. - OK, can we eat first? I'm starving. - Ooh, yeah. I see that chocolate thing right there. (laughing) - Whatcha working on? - A cost estimate... Ooh, thank you. Um, I'm working on a cost estimate for a Bar Mitzvah. - You know what I've been thinking? - Hmm? - That you should move in. - Wait, really? - Well, yeah, why not? I mean, we are getting married, and you already do spend 3 nights a week here anyway. - Yeah, true. Ooh, but that commute to work would be a killer. (She laughs.) You're worth it. - Actually, I had something else I've been wanting to talk to you about. - My commute to work? - No, just work. - What about it? - Well, you know how much I love to travel, and I want you to come with me, and that's kind of hard to do if you're still working at the hotel. - Uh, OK, so, what are you suggesting? That I quit? - Well, come on, Rachel, it's not like you need the money anymore. I mean, you make, what, 70, 80 grand a year? I mean, it's not really worth it, is it? - Wow. OK, did you just seriously belittle my job and my salary? - I'm sorry. That came out wrong. - Yeah, it did. - Look, baby, I am sorry. It's just... I want to spend more time with you. - Yeah, but it's just that I love my job so much and I worked really hard to get to the position I'm at. - And I am so proud of you, baby, and I know you have. But as my wife, you kind of don't really have to work anymore. - OK, so, what's your point? - You love coordinating weddings more than anything else in the world, right? And you are great at it. So, why don't you open up your own business right here at home? - What? - I'll finance it, and you can have as many or as few clients as you want. And the rest of the time, you get to travel with me. - Really? - Uh, really. (both laughing) - He wants you to quit your job? - No, not quit. Just start my own business. - Oh. You never mentioned wanting to do that before. - Well, I don't know. I guess I never thought it was a possibility, but the idea of it's kind of exciting. - Yeah. - Yeah, and you could come work for me. (Laura chuckles.) - Are you sure that's what you want? - Yeah. Yeah, I think it could be a really great new beginning. And besides, you have to turn my room into a nursery soon. - I don't need your room for a while, so... I don't know, 6 months ago, you were breaking up with John, moving in; now you're getting married, and I'm pregnant. - Oh, sweetie. - Yeah, things change so fast. - Thank you for seeing me on short notice. - Of course. What kind of event are you having? - Actually, I'm not having an event at all. My name's Jerry Berman. I'm a private investigator. I'm here on a personal matter. I was hired by the father of a woman named Dominique Ranton. Has anyone mentioned that name to you before? - No. - She's from Atlanta. She's gone missing. The last person we think to see her was Craig Miller. - I don't understand. - They were romantically involved. I'm surprised you didn't know. - When did she go missing? - The last call she made on her cell phone was about 6 months ago. - What does this have to do with Craig? - We both know how controlling he can be, how violent. - He's not violent. - Did you know that he was arrested 10 years ago for domestic battery? He punched his girlfriend. - If you have any questions for Craig, I think you should talk to him directly. I'm certainly not gonna get in the middle of this. - One woman assaulted, another vanished. Be careful, Miss Malemen, for your own sake. (door opening) (door closing) - Good boy. Good boy, Cody. (dog panting) Go lay down. (She sighs.) A private investigator came to see me at my office today. - About Dominique? - Yeah, he, um, he said that you guys were seeing each other a while back? - Yes. She was a girl that I dated briefly, it was never serious, and I broke it off. - He implied that you were the last one to see her. - Well, that's ridiculous. The last one to see her is whoever she's with now. What's wrong, sweetie? - He said that an ex-girlfriend of yours claims that you assaulted her. (scoff) - OK. Let me tell you something about this PI. OK, because of who I am and because of who my family is, there are always gonna be people trying to scam us for money. I mean, extortion, frivolous lawsuits - baby, it comes with the territory. I'm just used to this BS, that's all. And I know that you're just experiencing it for the first time, so please don't let it get under your skin. - W... But is it... is it true? Were you arrested? - Didn't you hear what I just said? I'm sorry. I'm... (He sighs.) I just get so frustrated with this stuff. I mean, it's not you. It's not you, baby, it's them. I mean, this girl, Melissa, said that I tried to hit her. She lied, babe. She made the whole thing up just to get me to pay her off. I mean, why do you think I was never charged? Because there was no proof, other than her word. She wanted 50 grand, and... I thought it was the bargain-basement deal to make her go away. The same things are gonna happen to me all the time. I can't change 'em. I love you more than life itself. I would never do anything to hurt you. I need you to believe that. - OK, what is it? - What are you talking about? - Look, something's been bothering you. - Nope. - You're being edgy. - Look, nothing is wrong, OK? If you could just stop asking me, everything would be fine. Please. (car honking) - No, you're not edgy at all. (sigh) - Hey. I'm sorry. Nothing's wrong, OK? Everything's fine. (car honking) - [City and state.] - Atlanta, Georgia. - [What listing, please?] - Georgia Community Credit Union. - [One moment, please.] - I just find it a little odd that he didn't even bring her up. I mean, if she's his ex-- - Well, yeah, but, I mean, I told him about John, but I didn't tell him that I worked with him. - Yeah, but she's missing, and the other one filed an assault charge. - But he said that she was lying about that, that she was just trying to get money out of him. I don't know. I mean, I talked to Dominique's father, and he didn't seem like a gold digger; he just seemed like a guy desperate to find his daughter. - This is kind of scary. - Yeah. - So, what if this PI is right? What are you gonna do? - I don't know yet. - Why do you keep harping on this? - Well, because I want to make sure there's not other things you're not telling me. - I've already told you everything, so stop asking. It doesn't concern you. - It doesn't concern me? OK, well, maybe the rest of your life doesn't concern me either. - What is that supposed to mean? - It means maybe we rushed into this way too quickly and we don't know enough about each other. - What, so you don't want to marry me now? - I'm saying that maybe we need to take a step back and make sure that this is something that we both really want. - Well, it's what I want. Come on, it's what you want too. - You know what? I think it would be a really good idea if I moved back in with Laura for a while. - No, no. - Craig, I'm not saying that we're gonna break up-- - Baby, baby, baby, you're not going anywhere. We're getting married. - Look, we just need some time apart, that's all, OK? Move. - No, just sit down, sit down so we can talk about this. That's all. - Craig, if you want to see me again, you will step aside right now. - You're not leaving! - Ah! - Maria? Maria? - Hey. I, uh, gave her the day off. Thank you very much for bringing this. - Here you go. - Ryan! I'm upstairs! I need help! - Is that...? - Don't. Ryan! - Ryan! Come upstairs! I need you! Ryan, please! He's gone crazy. Please. - No, man. - Give me the key. - Please... - Just give me the key. - Go. - Ryan, please, please, no. - Go. - No. No! Ryan, don't leave! Ryan! Please! (Rachel crying) - OK, talk, man. - I had to calm her down. She was... she was hysterical and she was trying to leave. Everything is fine. We're getting married today. I've already made an appointment at City Hall, and then we are on a jet to Belize. - That's your plan? Seriously? Oh, my god, man. You are losing it, OK? You cannot force this woman to marry you. - I am not losing it. I'm not losing it. This detective, he... he put all these crazy ideas inside her head. - Yeah? What about this? This won't work. As soon as she's free, she's gonna tell somebody. - I've made sure that won't happen, Ryan. It's under control. Look, she loves me, and once things settle down, once I get some time alone with her, she will see that again. - Please, man. Craig, please. This is wrong, OK? Just let her go. Please, Craig, just let her go. I'm begging you! Give me the key. - I can't. I can't, because if I let her leave now, everything unravels, and it unravels for the both of us, brother. - Exactly. You got us into this, OK? We're going to jail because of this! - No, just... just let... just let me handle it. Let me handle it. I promise you, we will be fine. - It's all yours. You handle it! - Where's Ryan? - He left. - What's that for? - It's so that you will have something to wear when we get married today. - What? - Yeah, it's all set. We've got an appointment at 11:30 at City Hall. We just have to get there a little bit early to get our marriage licence. And then it's off to our honeymoon. - No, please. Our honeymoon? Where? Where are we going? - Oh, wouldn't you like to know? It's a surprise, Rach. It's somewhere very secluded, where you and I are gonna have plenty of time to work on our relationship without the influence of people trying to get in the way of our happiness. - But what about work? I can't just disappear. I mean, they're gonna know that I-- - That is why you're gonna call your boss, and you are gonna tell him that you're eloping, and that you're quitting sooner than you thought. - But they won't believe me. They... - Well, then it's up to you to make them believe you. Unless you don't care what happens to Laura and her unborn baby. - (crying): Oh... - Accidents happen every day, Rachel, especially when you have the money to make them happen. So, if you want to protect your friend, you are gonna make sure that everyone we see today believes that you are just as excited about this wedding as I am. You understand me? Do you understand me? - Uh-huh. - OK, now, if you try anything, like running away or calling for help, like you did earlier this morning, Laura's dead. Time to get dressed. - Please... - Go get dressed! - (Rachel): What are you doing? - He's got to go. Can't come with us. - What? No! - Well, I can let him go and maybe a nice family will come by and pick him up. Or I can tie him to the bumper, drive off, and there will be no more Cody. Right? Right, buddy? It's your choice. What's it gonna be? - Let him go. - Yeah, good boy, good boy. - (crying): I'm sorry. Cody. - Come on, buddy. Come on. Good boy, Cody! - (crying): No... I'm sorry. (Cody whining) Sorry. (cell phone ringing) - It's Laura. Tell her we're going away, and make it convincing. - Hello? - Hey, where are you? I just stopped by your office but you're obviously not there. - Yeah, I'm not coming in today. Um, I left a message with Paul. - Oh, why? Are you sick? - No, no, Cr-Craig and I are getting married. - What? - Yeah! It's totally impromptu, and, uh, we're going to Greece afterwards for our honeymoon for a month! - Are you sure you're OK? - Absolutely. No, this was all my idea. But listen, honey, I can't talk right now. Um, I'll... I'll call you once we get to Greece, OK? - [Hold on, hold on.] What about Cody? Do you need me to take care of him? - No, no, thank you, no. We're gonna take him. All right, OK, I gotta run. - Rachel, hold on a second. - Bye. - Oh, my god. - Good job, Mrs. Miller. (people chatting excitedly) - (woman): That's sweet. - (man): That's really nice. - We're up. - Do you have your licence? Thank you. OK, let's get started, shall we? (Cody barking) Do you, Craig Miller, take this woman to be your lawfully wedded wife? - I do. - And do you, Rachel Malemen, take this man to be your lawfully wedded husband? - I do. - By the power vested in me by the state of Pennsylvania, I now pronounce you husband and wife. - Shall we? (cell phone ringing) - Hello? - [Rachel Malemen?] - Um, no, this is her friend Laura. - This is Dr. Moss at the Salerno Veterinary Clinic. I have Cody here. [Someone found him without a collar.] [We got your number from his microchip.] [There was another number, but no one answered.] - Oh, my gosh. Thank you so much. Um, just give me the address and I'll be right over there. - Twenty-six hundred Kentwood in Salerno Valley. - OK, I will be there as soon as I can. - Great, we'll keep him busy until then. - [OK. Thank you so much.] - She's coming to get you, Cody. - Salerno Valley? What's he doing all the way out there? Well, they elope without telling anyone. And she said she's taking the dog with her. I just got a phone call from the vet. He's been found out in the country. - Yeah. Something's very wrong here. - Yeah. (doorbell) - Can I help you? - Ma'am, my name's Jerry Berman. I'm a private investigator. Is Ryan in? - Yeah. Come on in. - What are you doing here? - Where's Craig? - I have no idea. You need to get the hell off my property. - Look, I know he killed Dominique, and now something's up with Rachel. And I think you know what it is he's up to. And I swear to God, if he hurts her in any way, I will see to it you rot in prison. - What's going on? - Nothing. - Tell her. Tell her what he did to Dominique, what he's gonna do to Rachel. - What's he talking about, Ryan? - Honey, I have no idea. You need to leave. - Where's Craig? Where's Rachel? - I don't know. OK? I don't know! - You know, if he hurts her, and you don't do anything about it, you're an accessory. - Ryan, we need to talk. Ryan, come. Come. - Why-- - I'm sorry. Give us a moment, please. Ryan, we said we weren't gonna keep secrets from each other. Now, something has been weighing on you for weeks now. I need to know what it is. - Look, I can't, OK? - You can't what? Tell me! - Look, it's worse than you can imagine. - What's worse?! - Off to the airport. - You need to stop protecting Craig just because he's your brother. You need to think about us. And you need to think about everything we worked so hard for. I need to know what it is, Ryan. It's not worth going to prison for. - You don't understand, all right? I was there. I helped him. - You helped him do what? Ryan, what did you help him do? - Look, I'm so sorry, OK? - Ryan, I need you to help me. I can help you. I know your brother Craig's behind everything. But I need you to tell me where he took Rachel. - He kidnapped her. - Oh, my god. - When I got to his house this morning, he had her chained to the bed. - Are they still there? - I don't know. He said he was taking her to the airport to take the leer jet. they're going to Belize. - Which airport? - Northglen. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Please forgive me. (phone ringing) - Detective Millstrom. - It's Jerry Berman here. Craig Miller just kidnapped a woman and he's heading to Northglen Airfield! - What? - Look, I'm not far away.
