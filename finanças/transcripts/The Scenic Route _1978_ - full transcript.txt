On the wall is a picture of a woman sleeping. A man is watching her. Her bed is floating on the ocean. I stay up late every night writing in my notebooks. Just a collection of scribblings, too benile to show anyone. I noticed with distaste how many sentences begin with I, or today I. Tonight I went to the opera with Jack's parents. Morpheus and Eurydice. It was the time of, remember the mad killer? Everyone stayed in their houses. One day Jack came back. He let himself in. He said I had used him, and he wanted to get back his own. He tried to rape me. That bastard. I think I had been married to him for four years. A monster. I changed the lock. For days I had dreams of revenge. I was afraid to go out. I was afraid to stay in. Help! Help! Somebody please help! It was the first time I ever touched anyone else's blood. It was also the day I got the first letter from Lena. Help! Help! Somebody help me. It was as if she was the cause of it. I needed a change. The plan was to drive cross country. I was a little afraid to go by myself, a woman alone. I wanted mythic landscapes, places where you could live out heroic passions. Aw, yes. Eurydice dies. Morpheus rescues her from death, but is not allowed to look at her until they are both safely out of the reaches of hell. She wants to die again because she thinks he is indifferent to her. Total misunderstanding. He turns around to prove he loves her. Fool. He has the chance to save her but loses her instead. That's what I need. A myth to live by. Look at him. He timed his move so that she never saw him looking at me. Whenever she looks up he seems to be paying attention to her. He was very good at it. I never thought to ask later who the woman was. Ever since Jack and I split up, I've been making up for lost time. But I still wear my wedding ring, as if to say I'm good enough to belong to someone. You'd be surprised how many men are pleased to land a married woman. We rarely talked, except for pass the ashtray or I'm going to take a shower. He asked me nothing, he told me nothing. As far as I was concerned it could have gone on forever. Although I knew that if it lasted three months it would be a miracle. I felt secure with him. I hate silent men. What are you thinking about? I diluted myself into thinking they're thinking about me. Is it about me? Us? Let me guess, you're thinking about, making love. Right? The wonderful part of it is that he always wanted me. Will I ever find another like him? We have to hurry though, I have to be somewhere in an hour. Another woman? Somewhere. It is another woman, isn't it? You're so nosy. I wouldn't even tell you a lie much less the truth. I felt uneasy with him. Then she called. She wanted to come and stay with me. I didn't think it was a good idea. She was going to screw up my life again. I said, "Yes of course. Come." How could I say no to me sister? Then one night. Oh he could be so charming when he wanted to, but only if you didn't know him. They sized each other up like prized fighters. I was glad that he saw me with another man. It would have been better if it was someone whom Jack could be intimated by. I'd like to wipe the smile off his face. I was pleased that the woman he was with looked so much like me. Shortly after that he said give it to me. Give it to me. He wanted my wedding ring. It was none of his business. He was insistent. It was time, I suppose. But I wanted something in return. He is more flexible then he looks. Your husband is a shit. Perhaps I underestimated Paul. He was beginning to interest me. Then she appeared on my door step with all her belongings. I wasn't used to the idea of living with another person. But it wouldn't be forever. This is your room. Would you believe her capable of murder? That violence in her, I admire it, and envy it. I guess I was guilty. She was my sister, he was my boyfriend. I must have made it happen. And the bathroom? I take this picture with me wherever I go. I want to tack it up. Look at the wall in front of you, what do you see? We were going to get along. I blocked it out. The doctors have a name for it. They told me I stabbed him with a kitchen knife. What was a kitchen knife doing in my bedroom? Jack just moved out and left me. He pays the rent, his parents are rich. He owes me. He ran off with a 17 year old student of his. I would've liked to have met her. I wanted to scream, but I thought it wouldn't be nice. Can you imagine I didn't want to make a fuss because I knew it would embarrass you. He slept on the couch because it would have been too dangerous to drive with the heavy snow and all. He slid into my bed, and whispered over and over how pretty I was. You're so beautiful. You're lovely. Maybe I was. I don't know, provocative. Not that I'm making excuses for him. He was a pig. He deserved what he got. I have to look in my notebooks to remember our marriage. I haven't forgotten the big things, how me met, the eight months we spent in Italy, I haven't forgotten my Italian, but him, all the details, the way he ate, the way we spent the weekends. I'm just grabbing at straws. I remember the silences the most. I think I'm ready for a meaningful affair. I always wondered about her part in it. He was her boyfriend. Did she tell him it was okay? I was only 15 at the time, and she, four or five years older. All of her boyfriends were weird, even then. He wouldn't let go. I fumbled around for something, anything. I stabbed him. And the years in the institution, not a word from her. Birthday gifts was all. Do you have any pictures of Jack? Not anymore. I think I used to be ambitious once. That desire will return when the time is right. Right now I'm in the desert. I'm glad she came. It makes a difference. I began collecting things about sisters. Famous sisters, sisters who were writers, sisters who were actresses, sisters who were both singers, sisters who. It was a game that amused me. I pretended that I was malleable. I went along went whatever Estelle seemed to want. But men always get in the way. I know it will happen again. It's only a matter of time. I felt an unspoken threat in her behavior. She had the upper hand. I was the stranger in her house. I stopped seeing Paul for a while. I wanted her to think that I was, I don't know, I thought it would upset her. I didn't want trouble. Do you know what this means? We must have created not only window to the future, but a doorway, a time rift, a warp of the space time continuum through which matter can pass. Running short, the fuse... - There's no time. There's no time, they collapse as quickly as it came into being. The readings, the new setters, come on, quickly. I hate science fiction. I never think about the future, do you? Do you want to change the channel? I don't care. We interrupt this program with a flash news bulletin. The double barreled shot gun killer has claimed two more victims. A new composite sketch is being made up incorporating the latest eye witness reports. Tune into the 11 o clock news for more details on this and other stories. Turn it off. Let's go away somewhere. Together. I checked out the Greek myths dealing with sisters. One was always a milksop. The other a trouble maker. I sense something empty and unfulfilled in her. I wanted to caress it away. Of course she would never have let me. Even if I were to try. No one can afford to admit to that kind of hunger. She'll never mention the past. She pretends it never happened. Better not to mix in. I have to get a job and get out of here. She started to bring men home. I didn't think it was fair to say no guests but I didn't like it. Betrayed would be too strong a word. Hold it a sec. I want to take your picture. What for? I don't want you to. I'm not gonna blackmail you, jerk. I don't even know you're name. I started seeing Paul again, his place. It wasn't the same without the gold stars illuminating the midnight sky. No magic, I ended it. They discovered the body of a two million year old man in China. I wanted to check out the Egyptian mummies in the museum. Lena thought it was silly. You've been following me for blocks, why are you following me? I know where you're going. I'd like to walk you. Oh would you? What do you want? Let's have a drink, my place. I know what you really want. I knew you would. Is this more like it? Is this what you really want? Is this what you're talking about? Hey, wait a minute. What's the matter, what are you afraid? What are you doing? Come on, what's the matter? Why don't you do it - right here in the street? - What are you doing? - Get your hands off me. - Is this what you - were talking about? - What are you crazy? Hey you're crazy, you know? Hey get your hands off me. Get your hands off me. Come on. Get your hands off me. You're crazy, I'm gonna call the cops on you, your crazy. Hey wait. I thought you wanted to fuck me. Faggot. First I heard a key in the lock, but the door wouldn't open. Then the bell rang. I asked him in. Our eyes spoke as we exchanged empty pleasantries. The weather, my job, I didn't have one, his job, how much coffee and sugar have gone up. Do you know Falouis and his complaints about marital difficulties, the story's all too familiar, from now on... Estelle. Wait. You don't understand. I didn't know, I really didn't know. Ow! Ow! Don't pull, don't pull, it's tangled, hold still. Ow. Don't pull it's my bracelet. Your hooked on the bracelet. Okay, don't pull it, don't pull it. It's tangled. Don't pull. Don't pull, easy. When I saw him gloating, I knew he had triumphed. He tricked both of us. We both fell into his trap. I should have known better. Get out of here. Get out of here. Get out of here. Get out of here. Get out of here. Get out of here! I'm sorry. No it was my fault. I'm so sorry. Are you alright? Yes. I'm so ashamed. No, I'm to blame. We would go away together, the Grand Canyon. I wanted to see Death Valley and the Painted Desert. She wanted to go to Egypt and see the Sphinx but she said she wouldn't mind seeing the sequoias. You're always spying on me, always checking up on me. Every move I make, you're always there. Now look what you've done. If you knew how expensive they were, you'd be more careful. She wanted to confide in me. One day she came home, - Estelle? And said I want you to meet my friend. I want you to meet my friend. What does this mean? If you did this on purpose... I don't know what you're talking about. I mean, it's him. Why hello, Paul. Paul and I know each other, isn't that so, Paul? Its a small world. Come in. If they were both innocent I could be persuaded to believe in the magic of coincidence. But I wasn't sure I would know how to use it. I showed them my slides. I wanted to shake them up. Jack thought, oh what do I care? He thought it was morbid, my collection. It was to find a clue. I couldn't figure out how it all went together. Of course, I wasn't alone. I watched as if it were a window across the way. I couldn't pull the blinds down. All the slides got mixed up when the trays fell on the floor a few weeks ago. Can I get you anything, another drink? This is what he thinks. He thinks the two of them together, my private harem. He has fantasies. Now you get over there, and you, like that. Much better. Over my dead body. Don't even dream of it. I've ruined the set. I'd like to replace it. You can't. They're impossible to get. It was an anniversary gift. Give me the pieces. Don't hurt yourself. No, I'm usually very careful. I went to the movies by myself. He brushed his arm against me as he went to his seat. Movie theaters. You touch and are touched by parts of bodies that you never knew existed. The backs of knees, thighs. The sight of two giant faces kissing one another stirred me. I felt his finger on my hand, his foot on my shoe, my calf resting against his. He assured me that his house was very clean. He was a computer analyst. I got my ring back from Paul. There, that's better. The eight month search for the double barrel shotgun killer has finally come to an end, tonight. They caught him, the masked murderer. It wasn't Jack after all. They wanted to capture him alive, the man who terrorized the city so they could ask him what made you do it. So they captured him alive and they asked what made you do it? Well do you think anyone could make heads or tails of his answer? Everyone was very miffed that he didn't feel remorse. Said one woman, he was such a nice man, so quiet, so polite, he always had a nice word. I wanted to figure out a way that she and I could live together as friends. For the moment, we were engaged in some kind of struggle. It added color to our colorless lives. Speak for yourself, your colorless life. I exhaust myself trying to figure out what everyone was thinking. I had to sleep an extra two hours every night. From now on, I will let everyone live their own lives. Whether they want to or not. I thought I could trust him because he asked so little of me. I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you. ♫ Blue moon ♫ You saw me standing alone ♫ Without a dream in my heart ♫ Without a love of my own ♫ Blue moon ♫ You knew just what I was there for ♫ You heard me saying a prayer for ♫ Someone I really could care for ♫ And then there suddenly appeared before me ♫ The only one my arms will ever hold ♫ I heard somebody whisper ♫ Please adore me ♫ And when I looked the moon had turned to gold For me? There was one section that he especially wanted me to hear. What is it? Orpheus, it's an opera. Now I've lost her, my dearest one, she, who is my only happiness, my only hope, if only I'd never been born. Life is a burden to me. What shall I do without her? Answer me. Hear me. Answer me. Why don't you hear me calling you back to me? Let's go out dancing, this is boring. I had no idea he was such a romantic. Perhaps he is my hero after all. We'll see. I won't make a move. Lena wanted to go to the country, she wanted me to come along, they both did. I needed a change of scenery. I saw the invitation in his eyes again. In her eyes, something else. The two of them were impossible. I thought I saw him, the famous killer, the double barreled maniac. Then I remembered, he had been caught a few days ago. If I said the words it would sound like I am jealous but of whom? He wanted me, she needed me. I wanted something for myself. What's so funny? What are you laughing at me? What are you laughing at? He's not funny at all. Actually, he is. You're not. Yes he is. This thing with Paul, it can't go anywhere. Estelle is so passive, she makes me sick. ♫ He's got the potion and the motion ♫ When I'm feeling low when my love starts to flow ♫ He's got the power every hour ♫ He's the reason why my face is all aglow ♫ Just one kiss from his lips ♫ Is like taking Vitamin C ♫ Oh you can't imagine what ♫ A doctor does to me ♫ Doctor does to me ♫ Doctor Love ♫ Doctor Love ♫ He can cure my every pain ♫ He can make me well again ♫ Doctor Love ♫ Doctor Love ♫ He ain't got no competition ♫ Only he writes my prescription ♫ Doctor Love ♫ Doctor Love ♫ Doctor Love ♫ Doctor Love ♫ Ooh Doctor Love ♫ I needed a major operation ♫ Never thought that I'd survive from a broken heart ♫ He took me in as a patient ♫ You better believe he knew where to start ♫ There's no need for me to eat an apple everyday ♫ Oh he's all I'll ever need ♫ To take any pain away ♫ Take any pain away ♫ Doctor Love ♫ Doctor Love ♫ He can cure my every pain ♫ He can make me well again ♫ Doctor Love ♫ Doctor Love ♫ He ain't got no competition ♫ Only he writes my prescription ♫ Doctor Love ♫ Doctor Love ♫ Doctor Love We read each others thoughts. You're so beautiful. What are you do... Get out of here. Get out of here. Get out of here. Go back to her. This isn't what I meant. You fool. What are you waiting for? Get out of here before she wakes up. That wasn't what I wanted, Paul, not that way. You lost me a second time. You made your song come true. You couldn't rescue me. Instead of proving your love, you threw it all away. Estelle? Maybe it wasn't too late for us though. Estelle? I didn't want to lose her as well. Estelle? Estelle? In my notebooks it ended like this. The two of us and him. Furs in smoky rooms. Pistols and the faint smell of bourbon. The two of us united as one. Forever. Paul! Paul. Guess what? We're going away. Me and Paul. Together. Right, Paul? This time I was loosing her for good. There'd be no going back now. I knew I wouldn't even have the courage to tell her I love her. I feel as if I'm sleeping in the ocean. It's warm here with you. I'm so glad you rescued me. Who was that strange woman? The one who looked so much like me? Let me off at the next exit. You should go back to Estelle. You're not my type. I needed some new myths for my life. The old ones don't work anymore. I get post cards from both of them. More from her than from him. His have no messages on them, but I know they're his. Hers never have a return address. She says we should stay away from each other for a little while. This one is from someplace out west. Very scenic, mountains, lakes. I prefer hot climates myself. ♫ Doctor Love ♫ Sweet Doctor Love ♫ Sweet ♫ Doctor Love ♫ Deep down inside ♫ Yes he does ♫ Sweet Doctor Love ♫ Sweet Doctor Love ♫ Doctor Love ♫ Doctor Love ♫ Doctor Love ♫ Doctor Love ♫ Sweet Doctor Love ♫ Sweet Doctor Love
