There you are Mrs Ladybug. Orange blossom with honeysuckle icing. Will there be anything else now. No that's all. Thank you Mr Bumble. Why where's Honey tonight? Honey! Yes Dad? Come on out here and show Mrs Ladybug your new dress. Good evening Mrs Ladybug. Well now... If you don't look prettier than a ruffled petunia. You know... Hoppity's coming back. Well for daisy's sakes. You don't say. My you've changed a lot since he saw you last. For the better. I'm afraid he'll find a lot of other things changed too. For the worst! Those human ones... Those human ones! Why the ways they've taken a tramping through the Lowlands. It's getting so your life ain't worth a sunflower seed. Anymore. One never knows who's gonna get it next. Mrs Ladybug. Mrs Laaaadybug. Mrs Ladybug. Mrs Ladybug, Ladybug. Fly away home! Your house is... My house! My house? Oh... Oh.. Ohhh! It's the humans ones! The humans ones are always getting into something! Rabble-rousers! Tsk-tsk-tsk-tsk. Its a goner. What'll we do? There's nothing to do, we're doomed to go, n' don't forget I told you so. It's that fence! Yes, jeepers creepers! For once your right! At this rate the human ones will trample us off the face of the ground. If anything happened to the Honey Shop. Come on Smack, we gotta' tell the boss about this. Yeah, dis' ought to be mighty inturresting to him. I tink' your right. Yes? ♪ Who is it? ♪ It's us boss. - Swat the fly. - And Smack the mosquito. Shhh! Nitwits, imbeciles. What if somebody should see you here. Now begone before I bash your bone head skulls! Yeah, but Mr Beetle... You told us to wise you up when there was trouble in the Lowlands. And concerning Mr Bumble and Honey. Trouble? Ah... what sort of trouble? From the humans ones boss. There was a fire. Mrs Ladybug's house. And a lotta' houses was busted down. And they was all beefin' and squawkin'. And sayin'... "What in the wings is the world a-coming to?" We'll all be exterminated. And Mr Bumble says... Bumble? Yeah, and he says... "Me poor daughter..." "If anything should happen to me Honey Shop." Very interesting. Very. You know Swat, the boss ain't no chump. He grabs off all this property up here where the human ones don't never come through. Sure he's plenty smart. Full o' larceny, full o' larceny! Very interesting. Good evening dear friends. I hurried right down to offer poor dear Mrs Ladybug my condolences. Thank you Mr Beetle. Oh, 'im... Most fortunate it wasn't your Honey Shop that burned. Eh Bumble? Oh and 'im... Of course you realise that this sort of thing couldn't possibly occur up there on my estate. No human one ever intrudes up there. I guess most of us are like to feel safe and secure. That's just the point Bumble, just the point. Merely reconsider my offer of marriage to your charming daughter and we'll all three live up there just as snug as three bugs in a rug. Now what do you say to that Bumble eh? Well I'm sorry sir but it's just like I said before. It's my daughters right to listen to what her little heart says. And it just don't seem to say, Beetle. I guess maybe you haven't just got "oomph" Mr Beetle. Anyway Hoppity's coming back. Hoppity humph! Bumble you're a nincompoop! I warn you, you're walking right into trouble. I'll sue somebody for this. Swat! Smack! Help! One, two, and whoops-a-daisy. ♪ La la la la la-la. ♪ There ya' are boss... all straightened out! And if you have nothing further to do, straighten that out! Hoppity's coming back. Hey! Gee-whiz! The human ones never stepped in there before. Jumpin' Johnny jump-ups! What's goin' on around here? It's Hoppity! Hi ya' Hoppity. Hello everybody, hello. Welcome back Hoppity. Well, well... Hoppity my boy! It's nice to see ya'. Ah gee, it's nice to see you too. Hello Hoppity. Honey. Oh, gee-whiz! Well, look who's here. Little Buzz. Look Hoppity, I'm a Bee Scout now. I'm a Bee Scout. So I'll grow up to be brave like you. Bee Scout Buzz, I salute you. A Bee Scout must behave. A Bee Scout must be brave. A Bee Scout must be prepared. Hoppity! Bah! Hey boss! Look out! Now look at whatcha' done, you needle nose! Why don't you keep your big nose out if stuff... Quiet! But boss, the smoke stick was headin' right for the Honey Shop. And you know what Bumble said about "if anything should happen..." Quiet! Hmmm... Why you! Get out of here! As far as I'm concerned there's... There's still no place like home. Jumpin' buttercups! They did it to us again! Them human ones are always... will somebody... don't stand there! Help and do something about it! Get that thing off my Honey Shop! Tsk-tsk-tsk most unfortunate. Well Bumble, don't say I didn't warn you. And now you are homeless. Both of you. Out in the street with no shelter over your head I've been robbed! Hoppity! Hoppity! Hoppity. Oh! Hoppity you'll be killed! Hoppity. Mr Hoppity! A Bee Scout must behave. A Bee Scout must be b-b-brave. This is gonna hurt me more than it does you. Oh... Oh gosh! Oh Hoppity, you make everything so complicated. Same old Hoppity. Hoppity, bah! Good night Mr Bumble. Good night. Have a good time. Okay, Mr Bumble. Take it easy small fry. Well the boss said to follow him didn't he? They're headed for that classy cabaretty. How are we gonna get in there?

The humans come through. There's only one thing that we can do. We're in a groove, we gotta' move. No you smooving. We're doomed to go and don't forget I told you so. But jeepers Mr Creepers we gotta' move. Where?! Where? Hoppity, there isn't anywhere 'cept that garden up next to the big place where the human ones live. Well, what's the matter with that? Not for me. Me neither. Well, all human ones aren't so bad. I'm going up and look that place over. Huh, it can't be much worse than it is down here. Oh, can't be any worse eh? We'll fix that. Won't you boys. Well Mr Bumble, the garden ought to be just over this wall. Somewhere. It's no use Hoppity. You'll never get to that garden with....

What about those human ones? I don't think you gotta worry about them. Anybody that'll keep a garden like this can't be so bad. At least I don't think so. Hey, hey Mr Bumble... Look at this. Just what the boss ordered. Now you take the high guy and I'll take the low guy. What a place to live in! Well, that's curtains for old man Bumble and the long legged lug.

Of course it's too bad your young friend had to fail so miserably, Bumble. But under the circumstances, wouldn't it be well to consider my offer of marriage to your daughter.
