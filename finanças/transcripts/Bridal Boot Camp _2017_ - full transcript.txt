Rip-Fixes-Sync by VaVooM Are we checking for defects? - I'm so sorry, I was just... - Checking it for comfort. Oh my god, you made this? - With old vintage lace. - Used lace. I love it. Wait til you see the wedding dress. My daughter threads a fit like no one I've ever seen. I can't believe it, I mean, it's exactly what I always dreamed. Well it was your dream that inspired me. It's just, perfect. Thank you. - What do you think, mom? - I think you need a better cake. Thank you so much again, Andy, and Bonnie, you've both been so amazing. You're so welcome. I would say come back, but that's something we never say at Bonnie's Bridal. Instead, our wish to you, One love to last a lifetime. Bye. Nearly 600 weddings since you were born and you're gonna be next. Well, technically Felice is next. She and Troy have a whole month on me and Jordan. Does Felice always have to go first? Have you met Felice? You're a really good friend, Andy, neglecting your own dress to finish hers. It's fine, I mean I only had four dresses to make this month, two of which are hers and mine. It's been a slow spring so, worked in our favor. Which is good practice, because someday you're gonna be designing your own and you'll have your own staff to make them. Oh yeah? What, Bonnie's Bridal goes worldwide? You're laughing, I'm not laughing. When would I even have the time? Once Jordan graduates, we're gonna start a family, and have to work around his crazy schedule and... Since when does it have to be one way or the other? When your father and I were raising you, we both were working. Yeah, and I was here at your work every day. As a matter of fact, I still am. Well fine, move your family to the dirty little city to accommodate Jordan's job. I'm just saying, why do you have to sacrifice everything for your partner? You and Jordan need to compromise. And we will, Jordan loves me. I know, and you love him, but you love your work. Just remember that. Mom, I'm in the middle of creating my very own wedding. How could I forget? - Cheers, honey. - Cheers. You're home early, thank you! - Felice! What are you doing? - I was using your restroom. And you need a new bulb. Almost used your trash can as a toilet seat. I thought you were Jordan. You thought Jordan left class early for you? That's cute. So, what do you think of the flowers? Do you think the white roses are like, bourgeoisie? Be honest. If you want white roses, it's your big day, right? No one can say anything, you get whatever you want. Good, I don't want 'em. It's just what my snooty mother wants. What I want is, pink roses everywhere, and for the only white in the entire place to be my perfect ivory dress made by my perfect maid of honor. Fine, whatever you want. And, what I want is for my perfect maid of honor to join me next week for the world famous Whitney Walsh's bridal boot camp. - Bridal boot camp? - Yes! - Felice, seriously? - Sounds fun, huh? - No? - No. - You said whatever I want. - Yeah, within reason. That isn't. Okay, so if you don't go with me, then I'm just gonna leave. Hi, I'd like to order a chicken pad Thai, and an order of spring rolls. After you order another order of that chicken pad Thai. Make that two pad Thai. Andy Phillips, five seven nine Aspendale, thank you. Why are wedding cakes never good? Almost every single one that I've tried over the past week has been dry, and I'm sorry but fondant is just nasty. My mom's bringing over some sample slices tomorrow. If we find a good bakery, you can use 'em too. So, have the same cake as you? No. Well, they make different styles, you know. Yours can have as much sparkle or whatever as you want. I just want it to taste good. If it tastes good and it has that triple berry cream thing, I'm all in. Perfect, 'cause I want dolce de leche anyway. And what about Jordan's groom cake? He wants dark chocolate strawberry. What about Troy? I have no idea what he wants. See, who's the perfect bride now? And, what is Jordan gonna eat for dinner tonight? What is Jordan gonna have for dinner when he gets home from a long day of work at the hospital and all those long hours of studying at school, while you sit here and eat pad Thai and drink Chianti? You didn't order anything for him. - I see no perfect bride here, Missy. - Well, you distracted me. I was gonna cook him something, but you just showed up. Sure, blame it on the best friend. Sounds to me like this bridal boot camp could do you some good too. Don't think I don't see what you're trying to do here, thwart me into another one of your absurd ideas, 'cause I don't need it. Miss perfect bride is gonna make her fiancee the perfect BLT. - Lady, step away from the bacon. - You know what, I'm outta here. You can keep it, bye. - Love you baby. - Love you too. Hey there, how was your day? Hi. The OR was awful, there was a really bad accident with multiple cars on the ten. - Oh honey, I'm so sorry. - It's fine, I'm better now. - So, what are you watching? - Hor deaurves on display. Just getting ideas for our spread. Oh, well, wait a minute. I thought you wanted a three course dinner. No, we changed it last week, remember? I don't wanna serve steak and have the vegans up in arms, or serve pasta and have the gluten free's freakin' out. - Right. - So, I told you this. I know, I'm sorry, it's just been a long week. - Cardiovascular quiz got you down? - No, pulmonary is this month. Cardio, cardio, was last month. - That's right. - Right. Sorry, so many wedding things on my mind. That's fine, it's just boring stuff anyway. It's not boring. - Babe. - I love your work. It's my job, and I even find it boring. And not to mention, you get all grimacy and stuff when I even get graphic about what we do in the OR, so give me that, okay? - Okay. - Wait! - What? - I made you dinner. But you don't even cook. We might as well start, 'cause we don't wanna be ordering take out every night for our kids. Okay, yeah, sure, so what is it? - It's a BLT, try it. - A BLT! Well babe, I mean, it looks great. But, you do know I don't eat mayo, right? Yeah I mean, you know, it's just so fatty and... You know, I don't like the taste. - Since when? - Since ever. - How did I not know this? - Babe, come on, it's fine. Look, we've only been together a little over a year, I'm pretty sure there are lots of things we don't know about each other. You can't expect to know everything about one another, can we now? We're not perfect. Look, I'm gonna go get a shower, and hit the sack because I am tired and exhausted, and I wanna get up in the morning, and go to the gym before I go to class, okay? - Do you wanna come with? - Yeah, I'll be right there. Yeah? Thanks for the sandwich. We're not perfect? I think what he meant to say was, he didn't expect you to be all-knowing, even though you like to think you are. I don't think I'm all knowing. But I did think that I knew everything about Jordan. I know that he misses high school baseball, I know that his favorite color is turquoise, I know that he always washes his hands twice cause it's work habit, and I know that he secretly tries to avoid cuddling because we both run cold, but this mayo thing... It just cuts deep. Andy, I just think you're making a big deal out of nothing, okay? I can't even tell you what color Troy's eyes are, much less his favorite color. Clearly I missed the mark here. I mean, how could I marry someone I didn't know hates mayo? So what, you're just gonna call off your wedding over a bad BLT? No, of course not, just... Maybe, you were right for once, about this boot camp. Maybe it's something we should try. I was thinking about that again this morning, and I just think it sounds a bit too much. I went on the website, and they said we have to wear heels the whole time for reception rehearsal, and I can barely make it around this park in flats. So, I think we just jump the gun on that one, okay? Felice, it was your idea. Yeah, that was before I found these water pills that you can take the night before your wedding. They make you go like... Okay, okay fine. But, I looked up that Whitney Walsh last night, and I was wrong about her. She's not just some rich housewife. No, she made a fortune throwing all these famous people weddings after years of being their yoga instructor. So, maybe she has some great tips about how to throw a good wedding? Even if the camp itself is a joke. Okay, but I'm not wearing heels, alright, that's how hammer toes are made. You're the relationship columnist that wants to run an article on me, correct? - With your permission, of course. - Sure, I love free press. Tell me, June, did you go to work today? And this is what you wore? - Did you borrow it from your fiancee? - I got it on sale at blooming... Did you buy it in the men's section? I just don't understand what a men's business suit would be doing in the women's aisle. I don't think it's a men's... Does your paper have a fashion columnist? And does she ever, tease you about what you wear to work? Duncan, and yes, he does, sometimes. If your fashion columnist wouldn't wear it to work, neither should you. - Hi. - Hi. You've been married before, yeah? Yeah. If you screwed it up the first time, what makes you think you can make it work this time? Okay go, just go. Hey, get back here! You need to learn how to stick up for yourself. Fight back. Okay. Okay sister wives. You think what I said was so funny? Because you're so young, and cute, and you're marrying your college sweeties? No, not at all. No it's not that, it's just that, we love your pinterest board. Well guess what, you can't pin the perfect marriage. So wipe that smile off your face. OCD elementary school teacher. That's me, my name is Wendy Day, my students call me Miss Day, but you guys can call me Wendy. Just don't call me on a Wendy day. Felice Davis, Whitney Walsh protege. Executive assistant, finance firm, impressive. Now you need to work on becoming VP. - And you must be our resident skeptic. - Excuse me? Andy Phillips, design entrepreneur. Tell me miss Phillips, why don't you think you can benefit from our program here? Well, honestly, I thought that I could be a good bride by just being myself. So you just came for moral support for your friend here. Well, then I thought, "Why not?" - Maybe I could improve myself here. - Good, I think you can. I think you all can. With my week-long crash course, you will all learn what it takes to be the perfect bride. You'll leave here with less fat, more confidence, and a one way ticket to a long, happy, lasting marriage like mine. Ladies, this is my husband, Preston Walsh. You may have stayed at one of his five star hotels, but, fancy hotels and long ski weekends are not what makes a marriage special. So what does then, exactly? All the amazing things that I've learned from it, which, I'm going to share exclusively with all of you, with my bridal boot camp. Rule number one, know your fiancee. Duh, kind of a given. You wanna keep your hubby happy? You gotta know how he ticks. For example, Preston hates mismatching socks. He loves green tea with milk over coffee. Even though he works crazier hours than I do, I know that our morning workout together is what keeps him sane, which leads me to rule number two. Look good. Men care moreso about how we look than we do. They want a woman that other men covet, so look good, they stay happy. Right, June? Easy for her to say, she was clearly born with those cheekbones and those legs. Rule number three, settle down. Maybe he isn't your dream guy, so what? Fairy tales have lied to us for far too long, ladies. There is no prince charming. There are only unstable men, or stable men that can be who you want them to be, if you let them. So, no more ideas about prince charming, and no flirting with men who you think are princes, 'cause guess what? They're not. Four, be interested. Be able to talk about a variety of subjects, like religion, sports, even politics, and be able to talk about his work too. Talk intelligently about it. You will undoubtedly have a multitude of differences, and if he can tolerate yours, you can tolerate his. Which brings me to number five. Stay strong, ladies. No one likes that messy mom in line at the grocery store with her kids running everywhere, wrinkled clothes, bags under her eyes. Don't be that woman! If we don't like her, do you really think the man that lives with her will? - Why not tell us how you really feel? - Something to say there, skeptic? 'Cause I've got sonar hearing, and just because you're cute, doesn't mean you can beat my boot camp. Here are your regimens for the week. Please do not faint. I assure you, you can all survive it, if you try hard enough. So, who's ready to get started? Kappa kappa won't be back. Hey, how long you gonna be around? A little while. I can stay until that flower delivery arrives. You sure? Yeah, just lock the front door and put a note, tell the guy to come round back. By the way, before I go, come with me up front, there's something I want you to try. Okay. This one is divine. I swear I'm gonna renew my nuptials with your father just so I can buy this insanely expensive cake. I was right, it's all about the dolce de leche. That's the one. Oh, shoot, it's late, I gotta run. Your daddy's cooking me dinner, and I don't wanna spoil it. Spoil it? You mean, he spoils you. Sometimes. Sometimes it's just an apology for leaving the toilet seat up. - I love you. - Tell dad Hi for me. I will. Oh well, more for me. What'd you forget? If you came back for more cake, think again, this is all mine. I wouldn't dream of taking your cake. It's clearly spoken for. Sorry, I thought you were my mom. Nope, just delivering the flowers. Well, we usually have them come around back. The front was open, and the lights are still on, so I... It's fine, can you bring them over here? Yeah. Thanks, are you new? I've never seen you before. What happened to Tiffany? I'm not new, no, but I don't usually deliver. Tiffany is out on leave for a little while. She and her husband just adopted a little boy. Oh really? That is so sweet. I knew she was trying, but I didn't know they were adopting. Yeah, it all happened kinda quickly. She got really lucky, we're happy for her. Okay, I got it. Did my mom ask you to arrange the vases for us? 'Cause we usually do that ourselves. Oh well, you're more than welcome to. I just, thought you seemed a little preoccupied with the feeding. Feeding? I am cake taste testing, thank you very much. And, I wasn't going to finish all this by myself. - What, enjoying my cake much? - Vanilla cream, that's very good. But you're not a vanilla girl, are you? Hey! Now that's the one, that's the one. Is that the one? I... Wait, wait, you said you weren't going to finish. Well, I was gonna finish that one. Is that the one you're gonna serve on your big day? It's a pretty big decision, better make it a good one. What, you think cake taste testing is some kind of joke? I think... I think I'm gonna be leaving now. Hey. You do, don't you? Hey! You do, don't you? It's not so much that I think cake taste testing is a joke, as much as I think that, well, weddings are kind of a joke. You think weddings are a joke? You think marriage is some kind of joke? Well, not to be the negative Nancy before your big day, but the US divorce rate does seem to agree. Fine, don't get married. Great, I don't plan to. But don't spoil it for the rest of us who do actually believe in marriage and think it's a beautiful thing. I mean, this is my whole life, it's where I work, what I do. And you seem to be very talented at it. Listen, I'm really sorry if I offended you, okay? And hey, congratulations on your big day, seriously. I'm sure he's a very lucky man to have you. He is. Great. Can I go now? Yes. It's very nice to meet you, Andrea Phillips. - Andy, it's Andy. - Great, I go by Casey. Goodnight. And then he's like, "Divorce rates seem to agree". I mean, seriously, he is a Connor's Flowers delivery guy. Shouldn't he be more pleasant? I mean, that's like what a flower delivery service is supposed to promote, love, romance, anniversaries, the occasional funeral, but, mostly love. Why would they even hire such a deputy downer? Jordan, Jordan. I thought we were gonna stay up and watch a movie tonight. How about you put one on, and I just rest my eyes for a bit. You seriously will not stay up with me? I will stay up with you, if you get up with me at 5:30 in the morning and go to the gym. That is not fair, you know how much I hate the gym. Please? Baby, you are really cold, you're like a refrigerator. - Yep, and you are a freezer burn. - Oh come on, look, hey. Come on, can we just watch a movie another night? Yep. - Love you. - Love you. You smell good. Are you feeling it yet? Well that's nothing compared to the pain you're gonna endure doing childbirth. Nothing! Compared to the pain I'm gonna put her through when she's not looking. She doesn't even have kids. Yeah but, can't you see the future brochures? "Mommy body boot camp". Wendy darling, do you remember what I said would happen to one who could not hold their yoga pose? One would have to skip cake eating etiquette on Wednesday. Well, I hope you don't like cake. I love it. Alright ladies, downward dog, let's see it. And do you think you could have done this pose in the band-aid of a dress that you were wearing yesterday? Exactly. Your downward dog looks like dead dog! Stop crying! Everyone, look at Andy. This is how a downward dog pose is supposed to look. Be like Andy. Butt-kisser. You know I do yoga at home. If I wasn't busy eating hair, you'd see the look of contempt on my face. Don't be like that, Felice. We're here to learn, remember? Patience in stuff like this will make you more patient in your marriage too. Don't give me that. I frickin' hate this boot camp. Okay ladies, you can relax. That was pathetic. Everyone put one on please. These are what I like to call, truth veils. Anyone know why? Because once you get married, the veils come off, and all of your hopes, and fears, and all your fatal flaws that you've been hiding from your husbands since the day you met, will be revealed to him. So we're gonna practice opening up to each other. Who would like to share their fears first? Wendy. So sorry, I'm so sorry. Oh god. My biggest fear, is that I won't have enough hours in the day to take care of my kids at school, plus my kiddos at home, and still keep my Rob a happy camper. And how would you combat those fears? Umm, caffeine. No, no caffeine, Wendy. No caffeine. I think you know where your real fears lie. I do? Go ahead, share with everyone what happens when you get anxious or nervous. - Go on, share. - Fine, I eat when I get nervous. Okay, so I think your real fears are simply based in no longer being desired by your husband, so you need to find a solution that does not involve emotional eating. - Can you do that? - Yes. Lorelei, your turn. I think you know your problem too. I do. It's men. Up until now, I've been afraid to commit. I mean, what if I cheat on Rick with a sexy pilot I used to date, who was no good for me? That's a good question. What would happen if you did cheat on him? I might lose him, forever. Yeah, it's a possibility. How can we fix it? Find another job? No Lorelei, we don't run from our problems, we confront them. We confront our fears, do you know how? I don't know. You go up to that sexy pilot, and you tell him that he is no good for you, and that he's got nothing on your husband now. Truth be told, he's much sexier than my Rick, and when he tips his hat off at me, with those sexy wings on the side, my insides just go crazy and I... - And you will have self-control. - But how? - Sometimes it's just so hard. - I have an idea. What if, every time you saw the wings on that pilot's hat, you thought of your Rick, because he's the one you ended up with and he's the one who really gives you wings to fly? It's true, my Rick is a gem. That's poetic, but let's try to keep our strategies based in reality, yeah, okay? Felice, you're next. Well, my fears are that I am too selfish, because I'm the only child. And what's your plan of attack? Well, to do something nice for him once a month. Okay well, once a week? But, I think we can do something nice for the one we're with every day, right? I mean, whether it's surprise baseball tickets or even just a kiss on the cheek, I think that every day is a better goal. Okay so, what are your big fears, miss gives-a-lot? Fine, my fear is fearlessness, because sometimes I worry that Jordan and me are too perfect. That's not a real fear. You know what I think? I think your real fear, is in yourself. See, I think I know myself pretty well, so... Really, then tell us, why are you here? Well, at first it was just for Felice but, now it's to prove you wrong. Well then, I look forward to it. - Hey Andrea. - Just Andy. - So, when's the big day? - June 29th. So soon. Yeah, but Felice's is in six weeks, May 18th. Best friends planning a wedding together, is that not competitive? No, it's fine, I'm making her wedding dress. You're making her dress too? Yeah, that's what I do, I make wedding dresses. You didn't say that on your application, it just said entrepreneur, where? My mom's shop, Bonnie's Bridal. Bonnie's Bridal, yeah I've heard of that place. It's a treasure trove for brides on a budget, huh? And I'm assuming you're making your own dress too? The perpetual perfectionist. Always wants the perfect everything. Well, I'll let you get to it. I'll see you tomorrow, or not. You and Whitney make nice? I think she really likes you. What? She clearly hates me. I can't tell, you had such wonderful input today. Okay, look, I didn't mean to sound preachy but, you're the one who admitted you can be selfish. Yeah, but sometimes you need to be. You can't always just be worried about Jordan. Or Felice. So how about, I finish your dress, and then I selfishly start making mine? I can't wait to see 'em both! Hello? Oh, geez! Oh, god, you nearly gave me a heart attack! And look, I messed up my dress. I said hello when I walked in, you just didn't hear me. Well, what were you doing sneaking through our back door like that? Yesterday you told me not to come in through the front. If not the front or the back, I'm not really sure how you expect me to get in. - Are you always this disgruntled? - No, I'm just tired. It's this new workout regimen I'm doing, and I didn't know you were coming back. My mom usually orders one delivery a week, so... Must be a busy week. Right, well, thank you, these are very nice. Oh, shoot, I'm bleeding. Sewing machine got me. - You okay? - Yeah, it's just a little pin prick. I'll be fine by tomorrow. Alright, well I am sorry. And hey, let me make it up to you. Are you hungry? 'Cause there's a really good pizza place down the street, and I don't know about you but, I'm starving. No, I'm good. I am engaged, remember? So I don't exactly dine with other men. Well I wasn't exactly asking you out on a date. Could be delivery for all I care. I'm just hungry, and I figured, since you're here working, maybe you were too. Okay, delivery, but this is platonic dining, - because I'm engaged, remember? - Yeah. - Casey, is it? - Yes, Casey, engaged, and yeah, same goes for you, Missy, no funny business, okay? - What do you want on your pizza? - Pepperoni. Alright. I cannot remember the last time I had pizza. My fiancee likes to eat pretty healthy, so pizza's a no. No pizza? You are madly deprived. - It's okay. - Your greasy chin says otherwise. Well, thank you for the pizza, and company. My fiance works in an OR and is in med school right now, so I eat most of my meals by myself. Well, there are worse places to dine. How long have you worked here? Feels like forever, since my mom owns the place, and she started working here when she was my age so, I pretty much grew up here. And is dress making what you've always wanted to do? It's the only thing I've ever really known. I mean, I thought about wedding planning in high school, but I just love design. How about you, how long have you been in the flower business? It's been about a year now. - Still kind of a new venture. - And what'd you do before this? I was working at a big marketing company. Kinda cutthroat, crazy hours, high stress. Not for me in the end, I don't guess. But, delivering flowers for Connor's is? You say that like you're judging me. I'm sorry, no I don't mean that, it's just, guess I was wondering how you plan on providing for a family with a delivery guy's salary. That's right, you think weddings and marriage are silly. Okay, hey, I never said I had a problem with commitment or family, okay? I want both of those things. Just without all the legal protections and paperwork mumbo jumbo? Now you're just putting words into my mouth. I just don't think that a lotta people think before they tie the knot. Or, you just don't wanna commit. What? You said it yourself, you couldn't commit to that marketing job, so maybe your feelings are the same about family and marriage. Well, think what you want, Andrea Phillips, but I'm pretty sure had I kept that job in marketing, I would've never had time for a family. I didn't even have time for myself. I think you make the time. Okay well, I can't just go up to my boss and say, "Hey, sorry, but I'm gonna leave early every day "without finishing my work so that I can go hang out "with my kids and my wife." It doesn't work that way. No, people make things work all the time, despite the odds, including marriage. And is this how we overcome those odds? With self-help regimens such as, Whitney Walsh's bridal boot camp? This has gotta be one of the most ridiculous... - Please tell me you aren't doing this. - Of course not! No, that's just for our guests, someone left it here. Hey, I think I have some cake in the back. How about dessert? - How about yeah. - Okay. So, if went to try this one... Guys! Did you see the article June posted on her blog this morning? She totally trashed the boot camp, calling it a "unbridled exercise in puritanical nonsense." Well who knows, maybe she's right. I know I'm getting sick of it. I don't know you guys, maybe Whitney is right. I'm just saying, who knows, we might actually learn something if we allow ourselves. Well, admittedly, I was actually thinking of quitting earlier this week but, you guys, I feel more in shape than I have in a long time. Yoga's my new calling. See, rule number two. Look good, you feel good. Yeah, and I saw that pilot last night. He brought me a latte. But, when I saw the wings on his hat, it totally reminded me of my sweet Rick. That's progress, rule number three, right? Settle down. See, I don't think we should listen to that columnist. I bet she's just upset that Whitney didn't like her wardrobe choices. Yeah, I just don't know if I can do it guys. That cake just looks so good. I swear, I am like two seconds away from face planting it! Wendy! What did Whitney say your cravings were stemming from? From the minds of the evil cellulite on my behind. - Exactly, and rule number five is... - Be strong. God, come on Day, get it together. You are so much better than that. Come on you guys, seriously, if we can't do this for one week, how do we expect our marriages to last a lifetime? Exactly, well put Andy. Our wish for you, one love to last a lifetime. That's the motto at Bonnie's Bridal, right? I read it on your website. Such a cute little philosophy. I might have to steal it for my boot camp. Now then ladies, this is the famous wedding planner, Julian. He's going to help us maximize our wedding's production value, while minimizing those budgets. Listen ladies, listen. Take notes. This is the simplest way to keep your Louis Vuitton's loaded. Prioritize. You place the most important individuals, such as immediate family and friends, nearest the bride and groom's table, while placing any degenerate cousins and that one gassy grandpa, down here, furthest from you. And as for all childhood friends who didn't like you back at school but are now stalking you on social media, all of those individuals you feel obligated to invite, but don't know how you'll afford to have them, There. Ten grand on an evening of artificial smiles, saved. Now, we'll move on to maximizing the production value of your wedding with... A great lighting scheme and choreographed dance numbers. You're still up. What are you doing? Not much, just trying to minimize our wedding budget. - Nice. - Wanna help me? Baby, I'm sorry, I'm so exhausted. I just promised my boss that I'd play a round of golf with him before class tomorrow morning. You're going golfing? Is that more important than our wedding? No, it's not more important than our wedding, but it is my job, and it's important right? Why are you worried about the whole budget thing, anyways? I mean, you can have anything you want. - My mom said they'd cover it. - It's not that, I just thought, maybe there were some people who didn't need to be invited after all. In that case... Yes, my Aunt Linda, yeah, she's a crazy one. We can actually get rid of her if you want, 'cause if you don't, that bar is doomed, I tell ya. That woman can drink. You remember that time I took you to meet my parents for the first time, and Aunt Linda was there, you thought she was my grandma? My grandma looks younger than she does. - I mean, that woman has lived. - Yeah. - Seems like ages ago. - Yeah. - Hard to believe it's been, a year? - Yeah. I cannot wait to have time like that again. Last summer was so fun. Well I mean, I don't know if we'll have time like that again. Once my residency starts, it's gonna get worse before it gets better. But hey, at least we'll have really nice vacations. But, don't you think once we have kids, you'll be able to get off early and... Yeah, sure, I suppose. I mean, maybe I can make something work like that, but, look, they're gonna have you anyway, okay. I'm sure you'll be taking good care of them until I get home, alright, you can tell them bedtime stories and make 'em BLT's and be all cutesy, and do all the mom stuff. - Yeah. - Yeah. You must be Rob, the history teacher. Wendy tells me you're a little anxious about today. Wendy knows I can't dance. There's no can't in bridal boot camp, Rob. Rick, the comic book writer. Your kids are going to love you. And I can dance. Patrick the police officer. Hate to be a criminal on the run from you. Freeze, LAPD! See what I did... Cute. And you must be Troy, the big pro football player. Yes ma'am, first string, six years and countin'. So glad you're here. You're such a gentleman, and it's so nice to see Felice smiling. She's usually so grumpy. - Where's Jordan? - He can't make it. He tried to get off work but, he couldn't. Well then who's gonna be your dance partner? Well, when it's her turn, she can just dance with Troy too. Or I'll do it. Everyone, this is Casey Connor, who does his very own special wedding arrangements, so if you don't have your flower arrangements booked yet, Connor's is the way to go. And we offer a 10% discount for first timers. - Those are beautiful, I want those! - Okay. You didn't tell me you were Casey Connor, the owner of the florist. And you told me that this was just some brochure for your guests, which I took, by the way, and decided to call so that I could try and promote me. Fine, yeah, I signed up for the camp but, for the record, my girlfriend dragged me here. Though, Andrea is just loving bridal boot camp, aren't we dear? And she's practically a natural at abiding by our boot camp rule book. Oh is she? And wait, how do you two know each other, exactly? Connor's delivers to the boutique. - And we had pizza. - Pizza? You don't eat pizza. Only thing you spring for are spring rolls. Why are you judging me? I had barely eaten all day. - And she ate it all. - Excuse us, she was talking to me. Sorry. Everyone, I'd like to introduce you to Antonio. He's our dance instructor. He will be teaching us a wonderful routine. Good afternoon, ladies. Shall we start the music? Who would like to go first? - Your hands are really warm. - Abnormally warm? No, it's just, my fiancee, Jordan's hands, are always cold so, it gets chilly holding his hand. Kinda like getting one of those ice cream brain freezes? Yeah. Sounds like you need a good pair of winter gloves to help you acclimate. Maybe so. I'm so sorry! We were doing so well. I didn't sign up to get my big toe broken, you know. - Excuse me. - Excuse me. Now that is what you need to pull off on your big wedding day. Yeah, I have no idea what we just did. Thank you for, staying to be my partner. - That was nice. - That's what a good friend does. So we're good friends now? Well if you wanna take advantage of my friends and family 20% discount on wedding arrangements, you should at least think about it. Okay, good friends. Thank you so much for coming today, gentleman. You were such troopers, and always remember... Be good to your brides for she holds the keys to your heart. Exactly, bye! Alright boys, see ya. This was such a great experience for my technique, Antonio. I feel like I learned so much from your moves. Thank you, I am so glad that you enjoyed it. I truly did, thank you so much. Your work is just amazing. - Okay, thank you. - What, he's hot. - Do you ladies have any plans tonight? - I'm usually too sore to do anything. Well, if you're too tired, I totally understand, but it's my bachelorette party tonight, and I don't have that many friends, so, if you ladies wanna join me, it would be so awesome! It's at Ramone's pub at 7:30. Are there gonna be male dancers there? 'Cause if not, I can ask Antonio, it would just... No, Lorelei, you can't. I hope you guys can make it, especially since tomorrow is our last day of boot camp. I'm gonna miss you guys so much. Me too. I'm in. I'm in too, and we all need just one last hurrah before bridal boot camp comes to an end. Well, I guess I could use a drink. Felice, I thought we were gonna go pick up your dress? It's fine, you can just bring it with you tomorrow when you come. Okay girls, so, tomorrow's the last day of bridal boot camp, and we're gonna be talking about nuptials, so get a lot of rest. Party! Felice, do you really think it's a good idea to go out partying the night before our last day of boot camp? Whitney will throw a fit if she finds out we were all out breaking the rules. Come on, she can't control our lives forever. And since when did you become such a stick in the mud in the first place? - You used to be so much fun. - Hey, I'm still fun. I'm just trying to stick to the rules we committed to, remember? Well in that case, why don't you take a look at rule number four again. - Be interested. - Good, I'm glad we agree. - Hey! - You made it! We did. - Thank you. - So, who wants to get crazy? Let's go, yeah. Geez, I am just so obsessed with these arrangements, aren't you? And I think the man who made them is obsessed with this one. Yeah. Really? I thought he was gay. I even invited him to come out tonight with us. Wait, but, he does flower arrangements. - No, I know he's straight. - I saw the way he was looking at you. Kinda like the way Wendy's been staring at those zucchinis before she inhales them. Hey! You, girl, are one to talk, because you almost fell off the wagon with mister dancy pants. Whatever, Rick knows I'm not going anywhere. We're getting married in six weeks. And I'm happier now than I've been in, like since the day we fell in love. Do you still remember it? I mean, the day you fell in love with him. What? Of course I do. Story time, do share please, do share. Well, I'd been seeing him around a while, 'cause he's friends with my best friend's boyfriend and one night, he was walking me home after we'd all been out. He knew that the pilot always brought me coffee to work every once in a while, so he pulled me into this late night coffee shop and bought me one bag of every kind of coffee bean, and when I asked him why, he said, "Because you deserve it all the time, "and not just once in a while when you need a fix." And then, he kissed me like, good. That's so sweet. Right? What about you, what about you and the cop? Wendy please, your turn, go, share. Okay, so, we'd been working together for a while, and I had my eye on him but, I didn't think he ever noticed me, you know, because he was so shy. My kids found out, because I guess I talked about him all the time, I don't know, and they told him that I had a crush on him. So one day, I walk into my classroom, and my students, they stand up one by one, and they hold up letters that spelled out, Will you go out with me? I know, and then, he walked in with this huge bouquet of flowers, and he asked me out himself. My, go Rob, I didn't think he had it in him, he's always been so... Unromantic? Yes, normally he is very unromantic, but, you know, that's how I knew he meant it. Andy, what about you? I'm gonna run to the restroom. How about you go first, I've heard this story. My turn. - Hey, what are you doing here? - Bachelorette shenanigans. Seriously. Wendy said she wanted to see my arrangements, and asked if I could drop off my look book since her wedding's around the corner. What about you? Did you just get here? No, I'm just leaving, actually. - Well I can walk you to your car. - Felice drove, so I'm just gonna... I'm just gonna grab a cab. What? No, no no no, I'll drop you off. Okay, fine, I'll wait right here. Seriously? You totally just Irish goodbye'd me. No, I'm just, I'll be fine. Yeah, you may be fine now, but, what kind of guilt would you leave me to carry, if something were to happen to you on that taxi ride home? Like what? You could, sit in a wet wad of gum, or get one of those really annoying drivers who just talks about the fungal growth on his big toe. Is that really something you want me carrying on my conscience? Okay, okay, fine, you can drive me home. I'll wait for you right here, I promise. You think I trust you now? I don't think so. I'm gonna let you take this look book with you tomorrow. I'm not letting you outta my sight. This way, your chariot awaits you. These are really impressive arrangements. And, you don't just do flowers either. Nope, nope, any kind of interior design, or exterior display horticulture, anything that's green. So when you quit that marketing job, what made you wanna do this? Well, I grew up in this little town outside of Austin, and back home there was always this constant competition amongst the neighbors to see who would win, yard of the month. And my mom and dad were absolutely hellbent on maintaining the crown, so I was often forced into their after school landscaping escapades, against my will, by the way. After I graduated and went off to college, I despised the thought of it all but, once I got into the business world, I really started to miss it, the peacefulness of it. So, you were bred into it, kinda like me and dress making. That's nice. I'd love to see your shop sometime. How about right now? - Okay. - Okay. - These are really beautiful. - Thank you. Are you hungry? 'Cause I can throw some burgers on the grill while I show you the garden out back. What, first pizza, and now burgers? You're a terrible influence, you know that? Okay, I can make you a turkey burger. I was avoiding fried food like the plague, but a burger does sound amazing. It does, after you. You did all this? Yep. I can show you my little greenhouse after we eat, if you like. That's where all the good stuff is. Where to next, ladies? Seriously? You wanna keep going? Dude, none of us are gonna be able to drive. Just don't even, just park the car, don't even get in them, let's cab it. The night's young, ladies. Let's go to the Rainbow Bar on Fourth! There's plenty of non-threatening men there, who really know how to turn it up. Yes! Onward ho's! - Yes, hold on, hold on. - Wait for us! You were very generous on the mayo. So what? I love mayo. Me too, me too. So my dad makes the best burgers, but I think you gave him a run for his money. Well thank you. Are your parents still together? Yeah, they have like, the perfect marriage. I honestly don't think that either of them has even looked at another person since they met. They are so madly in love. They go on dates, vacations, they even flirt, which is, kinda disgusting. But, cute. Yeah, I I think my folks must still be pretty in love, although they do bicker quite a bit these days. Though my mom likes to call it love quarreling. You know, sometimes I think they kinda ruined it for me, set the bar too high, and that's why I have such a hard time finding a girl that I would actually consider marrying. Come on, no, there are so many good girls out there. Trust me, if even I could find a guy great enough to give my parents a run for their money then, you can find yours. So when is the big day, anyhow? It is June 29th. - Nice, everything coming together? - I think so. I'm a bit of a planner, so I definitely got ahead of myself. All I have to do is finish my dress, and order my cake. - Yeah, yeah, the caramely one. - Dolce de leche, yep. Good for you. You know, it's too bad your fiancee couldn't make it today. He really missed out. Camp was actually, kinda fun. Between you and me, I didn't tell my fiancee about today. He doesn't even know that I'm doing this camp. Seriously? Why not, why didn't you tell him? Well I, I just thought if even I think it's kinda silly, and so does my mom and so do you, why wouldn't he? Well if you thought it was gonna be so silly, why would you do it in the first place? Well I realized there's still a lotta things I don't know about him, even though it's been over a year. I do wanna be the best bride I can for him, for us. Well, I imagine it takes a lifetime to truly get to know someone, so even if you guys are together 50 years from now, you're still not gonna 100% know each other. But that's gotta be one of the nicest things about a healthy relationship, you know? Finding out all those new things as they, and you, change, and then learning to grow with them, and then still choosing to be with that person despite all those changes. Do you really think that people change that much? I think we're changing every day. - No. - No? Not me, I know I have always been exactly the same. Are you so sure about that? Anyway, I still think you should've asked your fiancee to come today. I mean, you haven't even given him the chance to say no. Well, he had class, and I knew he couldn't get off for that. But how is he ever gonna step up to the plate if you won't ask him to? Okay, I guess you make a point. See there? Just now there, your opinion about something changed. Did you like my little greenhouse? Mr. Connors, your horticulture skills are impressive, but, I should probably go home now. Or, you could take a little break. Come here, I wanna show you something. - What, what are you doing? - Come, come, come down here. It seems as though you have a lot on your mind. When I have a lot on my mind, this is where I come to sort it out. So what do I do next? That's for you to decide. - Coffee? - Wait, what, it's morning? Yes, it's okay, I fell asleep here too. I woke up and you just, looked too peaceful to way up so soon, I figured you needed it. What... I'm gonna be late for my last day of boot camp. Okay, okay, no probs, I'll take ya home, I'll take ya home, let's go. Shame. I'm here, I'm here. - Sorry I'm late. - Nice of you to join us. You ladies look like you need hair of the dog, downward dog. Come on ladies, let's do this bridal boot camp! I'm sorry. I know you all must be in a lot of pain. That's not really my fault, is it? You all failed, hard. Why didn't you call me back last night? Sorry, fell asleep. I can't believe you just left like that, without saying goodbye. I texted you, not to mention I didn't wanna be there. Ladies, I can hear you. Okay, you can all relax, ladies. Namaste. Now, I know the original plan was to talk nuptials today, but, instead I think we should skip all that, - and write vows to ourselves. - Vows to ourselves? Yeah, yes, a vow is a solemn promise, and you have to write them for yourself before you can write them to your husband. Vows to ourselves? You have got to be kidding us right now, Whitney. Are you questioning my methods, dear? Yes, I am. I don't need to write some dumb vow to myself in order to be a good wife to my husband, thank you. Tell me Felice, when you singed up for this bridal boot camp, did you think it was just gonna be leafing through wedding catalogs, drinking bottomless mimosas, and eating chocolate covered strawberries? Actually, yes. You clearly signed up for this camp because you felt like you needed my help. How can I help you, if you won't let me? Well, I suppose I thank you, for showing me that I, in fact, no longer need your help. I quit. Felice, what are you doing? It's our last day of camp, you can't just take off like this. Making vows to ourselves about the kind of people we think we are? Don't you see, Andy? This boot camp isn't helping us, it's only turning us into a bunch of Stepford wives, making us more insecure about our flaws than we already are. What are you talking about? Sharon lost weight, Wendy got her husband to dance, Lorelei got over the pilot, it's helped everyone. Yet somehow, they were all dying for a moment of innocent fun last night, only to come here and what, be punished? I realized something last night, when I got home, and Troy was laughing at my broken heels and my frizz all the way out to here. Troy loves me for me, frizz and all. It's not the men that we need to worry about, Andy, it's us, and if we want our marriages to stay alive, we need to learn to listen, and to love ourselves. And if our husbands love us, then they will no matter what. Come on, Jordan's work schedule has been so crazy, but do you see me giving up? If you can't last one week of Whitney's silly little challenge, how do you expect to put in the work to make your marriage last? Come on, Andy, you're one to talk, you're so deluded about your relationship, you can't even see when you're off flirting with another guy you barely even know. What? I wasn't flirting with him! That's right, because you're the perfect bride. Yeah, just like perfect Whitney, and her perfect marriage to the perfect man that none of us have ever even seen. So what, he's probably working all day. Just like Jordan, and, I bet that's why she's just as lonely as you are. You're just jealous that for once, the attention is on me, and not on you. Yeah, that's right, that must be it, Andy. You know if it makes you feel better, then keep telling yourself that. Felice, wait. Here's your dress, and if you need any alterations, you're gonna have to use someone else, 'cause I need to work on my dress. Isn't that what you said? I should be more selfish? Okay, I will. Andy, this is really beautiful. Only thing is, it's not you, or me, for that matter. But thank you. Fine, get a new dress, get a new maid of honor while you're at it. Thanks for coming back. - Thought we lost you too. - Nope, still here. Pen and paper please? By the way, someone stopped by to see you. Make it quick. What are you doing here? I just, came to drop off the look book for you guys. I forgot to give it to you this morning. - Is that really why you're here? - Yes. Casey, I'm engaged, remember? I already knew that, but thanks for the reminder. Okay, will you just stop with the cutesy boy-next-door charm, and just admit that you have feelings for me, and that's why you keep coming around. Okay, fine, yes I do have feelings for you. But I never really had expectations about anything. I guess I just felt this intuition that, maybe you needed company, and since I like being around you, I just went with it, that's all. And it never crossed your mind to pursue more with me? I mean, maybe in my wildest dreams, but realistically, no, it didn't. - Did it cross yours? - Absolutely not, I love my fiancee. Okay, okay great. What's the problem? The problem is, I really don't think we can be friends anymore. Why not? 'Cause Casey, the world doesn't work that way. Two people who are attracted to each other cannot be friends, when one of them is already engaged. Wait, so it has crossed your mind that you might like to be with me. That's not what I said. - It's kinda what you said. - Well, it doesn't matter, okay? 'Cause my relationship is great. My fiancee is kind and wonderful, and honestly, I would never even think about leaving him to be with someone like you. Someone like me? What is that supposed to mean? Someone who doesn't even believe in marriage, someone who can't commit to anything. You're like a little kid living in some magical garden fantasy world. Okay, fine. We don't have to be friends. You know Andy, I want you to be happy, and I hope that you have the perfect marriage, just like you said your parents do, like how you said you honestly didn't think that either of them had ever even looked at anyone else since they met, all these years still madly in love, but if your relationship was really as amazing as you say it is, perhaps you should ask yourself, why are you falling for me? - Mom. - Oh, honey. Honey, if you wanna make it work with Jordan, then maybe you should've told him the truth. Your father and I, we don't keep anything from each other. The most important thing about marriage is honesty, and trust. Yeah, you're right. Have you talked to Felice yet? No, I don't think she'll wanna talk to me again after what I said. Honey, she knows that you don't mean this. You need to give her a call. I think I should just give it some time. Andy, the wedding is in six weeks, you don't have that much time. I know but, I just, I can't. I'm embarrassed, I lashed out at her when I know she's right. Anyway, I'm sorry that I came over so late. Are you kidding? Our door is always open for you, and I love the fact that you can come over here and we can still talk about these things. But, you're right, I do need to start depending on Jordan for more support. You should, but know that your father and I are always here for you, even though he's asleep. Of course. - Mom. - Yeah. Do you know the exact moment you knew you had fallen in love with dad? I guess I do. We'd been dating two weeks, two, I know that's crazy, but we were supposed to meet at this little grocery store outside the campus. We were gonna get some stuff and cook at my place, it was the first time he was coming over. And, I was terrified when he didn't show up. What, dad was a no show? Or so I thought, and I was heartbroken when I stood outside of that store for like an hour, I mean, just crushed that he didn't show up. So about 30 minutes after he was supposed to show, this pickup truck pulls up, and he's in the back of it, and there's this old couple in the front seat and they're waving at me, and well it turns out that, his brand new car had gotten crashed into at the dorm, and instead of worrying about his car, he was more worried about how I'd feel if he didn't show up. And it was at that moment I fell in love with him, him pulling up with his wind whipped hair and that goofy grin on his face, not a worry in the world. I like that story. And some day, you're gonna have one too. Hey, what's wrong? You alright? I don't know. What happened? Like last night, after the bachelorette party, you said you passed out on some lawn? It was a whole thing... Do you have time to talk? Like, like really talk? Yeah, of course, of course I have time to talk, if it's important, yeah. It is. - Sure you wanna do this? - Yeah. I'm sorry. This place is really cute. Yep, it's a treasure trove for brides on a budget, or so I hear. Sometimes I say things, and they come out of my mouth and they just sound ridiculous. Join the club. Hey, so I read these vows that you wrote, and I took them to heart, and I asked my husband for a divorce. What? - No, I didn't want... - It wasn't because of you. It was a long time coming, and your words hit me, like, hard. But the good news is, is that we're not getting a divorce. We're gonna work it out, we're gonna go through counseling, but, you know, it took me threatening divorce for us to finally talk at all. But, I thought your marriage was so... Perfect? Yeah, so did I, but I guess I didn't realize how much work it actually took. I mean, Preston's been so busy with his career, and I've been so busy telling everyone how to have their own perfect marriage that, I didn't realize how unhappy I was on my own. We never spent any time together. That's the reason why we don't have kids. Maybe that'll change now. That's so good, I hope it does. Anyway, I wanted to thank you. My rules really did need work. But you really do have a great grasp on things, and you're gonna be more than the perfect bride. You're gonna be a good wife, which is much more important. Well, I don't know about that. I actually ended my engagement last night. You did? I just, realized Jordan wasn't the one for me. It's kinda like you said, I spent so much time telling myself how happy I was, I realized I wasn't really happy at all. So I guess we really are alike. Two clueless sister brides. Well hey, in that case, you should keep these, and remember them the next time you're trying to get married. My one wish for you. Hi, I'd like to order a chicken pad Thai and an order of spring rolls. Make that two orders of pad Thai. Actually two pad Thai, Andy Phillips, five seven nine Aspendale, thanks. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have projected my insecurities on to you. We both messed up. I shouldn't have called you out so harshly, especially when I was the one who got us into this mess of a boot camp in the first place. Hey, at least we both screwed up together? So, when I went in the restroom, I couldn't help but notice Jordan's things were missing. Yeah he he moved to a temporary place near school. Honey, I'm so sorry. It's just, I couldn't think of one single moment in a year and a half, when I absolutely knew I had fallen in love with him. I knew I loved him, but, I think I got caught up in the idea of how perfect he was, and how perfect we seemed, that it just... Andy, sometimes we fall in love with the idea of a person more than we fall in love with what's really right in front of us, you know? You remember that guy, Jason, in college, who used to call me... - Mama lovin. - I swore I was in love with him. But, how did you know with Troy? Was it the moment that you fell in love? You know, I'm not sure, really. It's really hard to explain. But what I can say is, I've never felt like that with anyone else. It's kind of like asking, when did I realize that you and I would become best friends for life? - When you know, you just, know. - Yeah. Well, about your dress. Look, I don't care how much you fancy up my dress, because you made it, and I love it, and I am going to wear the hell out of that thing in six weeks on my big day, okay? You changed it back. I love it even more this way. - It's the wine, cheers again. - Alright, to us. To us, and life, and... - Wine. - The trees. That is so good. And now, a few words from my maid of honor, seamstress, and the best friend anyone could ask for, Miss Andrea Phillips. You know, it's funny, my friendship with Felice. We are so different, yet for whatever reason, maybe simply cause we chose to be, one in the same. Ever since we met, she has been pulling me into ridiculous schemes. Most recently, she dragged me to this thing called bridal boot camp. Yeah, it's exactly how it sounds. They have these rules you abide by to become the perfect bride. But, I think we've all forgotten what marriage truly means. Marriage isn't some lofty ideal of romance, nor is it some partnership of convenience. Instead, it's a heartfelt decision made by two people who choose each other, despite other options and the odds against them. And I know you're thinking, "Okay, how do we choose right?" Well, I made some rules of my own, that I hope might be of help. Rule number one, know your heart. In every relationship, each person must know what's inside their own heart to be true to the other. And rule number two, look good for you, because it's only when you love and respect yourself can you give another a similar kind of love. And rule number three, settle down, but settle down eventually and with the right person. Maybe there is no prince charming out there but, if he's right for you, he will treat you like a princess. And rule number four, be engaged. Don't just be interested, 'cause it's only when we're engaged in each other's lives, interests, and needs can we really grow together. And rule number five, stay strong, but stay strong together, because when you choose right, marriage is worth much more than the work it takes. Now, I know Felice didn't take some silly boot camp to show you the way, it took finding the right person, which you did, so cheers to you both. To Felice and Troy. - Cheers! - Cheers. That is one gorgeous dress you designed my dear. Well, we'll see how it does on the market. What, what are you talking about? Whitney Walsh wants to take some of my designs to the different retail buyers she knows, so we'll see. Honey, this is wonderful, congratulations! - Sweetie, we're so proud of you. - Yeah, nice job sis. How do you feel about profit sharing with your baby brother? No. Come on, let's dance. - Shall we join them? - Sure, I'll be there in a second. - How's my maid of honor holding up? - Good, how are you? I'm great, and thank you for the speech, it was beautiful. It's really such a magical night, isn't it? - Everything looks so beautiful. - I know. Especially these flower arrangements, huh? And, the guy who made them. - What is he doing here? - I invited him. You remember that moment we all talked about? I can feel it, and it's coming. - Hi. - Hello. What are you doing here? Confession, this time, I came because of you. Anyway, I couldn't just let you do all of our favorite past times without me, right? - Cake taste testing, and dancing. - You are way too nice. I said some not nice things to you, things that I'm very sorry for. It's alright, truth be told, you were right. I shouldn't have kept coming around knowing you were with someone else, regardless of whether my intentions were of the gentlemanly variety. But for whatever reason, I just, couldn't keep myself away from you. Yeah well, admittedly, it was hard for me too. There is just... Something about us, huh? Maybe it's that we both live in some magical garden fantasy world? Yeah, maybe, maybe. But hey, there are worse places to live. And I heard your speech earlier, by the way. It was really just missing one thing. Yeah, what's that? Be kinda disgusting, but cute. Shall we? Rip-Fixes-Sync by VaVooM
