HBO DOCUMENTARY FILMS presents in association with FILM2 IT WILL BE CHAOS ISLAND OF LAMPEDUSA ITALY 2013 Oh my brothers and sisters, you got lost in the sea... Lost forever... Do we have to go to the police station ? There have been another two shipwrecks yesterday. What do you expect ? That we keep all the corpses on the island ? There are 350 coffins, the stench has become unbearable. We can't keep the coffins here. According to the survivors, the boat was carrying 518 asylum seekers. People have died after a boat capsized and caught fire off the Italian island of Lampedusa. Lampedusa ran out of coffins... The shipwreck took the lives of 368 people. People are feared dead after a boat capsizes... The migrants were mostly Eritreans and Somalis. AREGAI This is my cousin Biniam and his brother Afewrki. And this is my cousin Zenawi. All of them have died. When we are near to Lampedusa they stop the boat to call help. Water is leaking... A spark happens. Boom ! The boat flips 180 degrees. People on the upper stairs, they all fall to the sea. Most of them, they can't swim. Because it's full of people, I see some people that are... ... looking down to the sea. They are dead. We are crowded even underwater. Because 500 people in the same place... And they are hanging over and over on the bodies... I said "Biniam". I said "Afewrki, Zenawi". I'm praying. Just saying... ... God forgive me. My brother was up there. I was down here working with my nephew. My brother approached saying that there were "illegal immigrants" falling off a boat. I grabbed my binoculars. There were so many heads in the water... It was hundreds of them. It was horrible. THE COLAPINTOS When we first saw them we were less than one mile away. This is where we rescued them. There were so many of them... We saved 18 of them. We took on board another two who were dead. We would communicate with our hands. Who can understand their language ? I threw life belts and ropes to pull them up on board. They are fleeing war, embarking on a deadly journey. If we could have saved more of them, we would have. Let's make it clear. Those who land in Lampedusa aren't "illegals". They are refugees. We are talking about asylum seekers. GIUSI NICOLINI MAYOR I know what your question was, but I have to correct you, otherwise you'll report that these are "illegals". Well, if you don't get it, neither will your audience.... Those who land on Lampedusa are not simply "undocumented". These people are "refugees". You know, words are important. Clearly, for us, and I think for you, the top priority has to be to save life, to save people from dying. WILLIAM L. SWING, INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION FOR MIGRATION We should take urgent action and stronger international coordination. First priority is our duty to receive the refugees with decent and adequate reception standards. The emergency was for the drownings. You shouldn't have a humanitarian emergency on land. The problem is that our policy is conceived to push the migrants back rather than receiving them ! Everybody is shocked, everybody says they want to work, so now's the time. If we want to do it, now is the time to make the changes. The "strength" of Lampedusa is to witness what's going on firsthand. He says thank you. Without you they wouldn't be alive. There is no need to say thank you. I am happy I was right there. Did he travel with other relatives besides his cousin ? I had two other cousins who died. Thank you. It's been such a shock always thinking about it... My heart would pound, I would sweat... One day I was home waiting for my brother's call to go out at sea. I had a panic attack. I can't go on that boat anymore... Living this tragedy firsthand I, as the mayor, am here to give maximum support to the victims' families. I won't move from here until every single corpse will be returned to their home. We need to see the remains of our loved ones. - What's his name again ? - Adel. - Did he find his brother ? - Yes, he did. This woman wasn't able to identify her brother, because she couldn't really see anything in the photos. But they know that her brother had some tattoos. And where the heart is, he had a tattoo "I love you mom". Tell them all the useful details. Everything useful to identify the corpses, you have to tell them, not me. I have no idea if a tattoo can last on the corpse of a drowned person... You have to be patient. Today Lampedusa and Italy are the focus of attention, but let's not forget that also other countries are facing strong migratory pressure. We in the European Commission are doing everything we can to have much stronger mechanisms at European level. This is not the European Union that we want. We need to do everything we can to prevent tragedies such as this one to happen again. But the DA's office has charged the survivors with the crime of illegal immigration. The law is the law, but of course this is a terrible human tragedy. I understand there was a request to process the survivors of the shipwreck on charges of illegal immigration, which would mean fine and expel them out of the country. How is this able to happen with people who have suffered such a trauma already ? When they'll start the asylum process, the charges may drop. But at the moment, yes, they are charged with illegal immigration. Calm, calm down everyone ! Are you going to change the migration law ? Will the survivors be indicted for illegal immigration, adding insult to injury ? STOP ACTING LIKE YOU CARE: POLITICIANS GO HOME... Journalists talk only about immigration... The landings, the alive, the dead... Never about the burden on the people of Lampedusa. LAMPEDUSEAN RIGHTS HAVE BEEN WASHED AWAY It's not fair that we have to do the government's job ! They left us to fend for ourselves. We are the ones to assist the immigrants. We all need a psychologist... This is a pressure cooker. Sooner or later it's gonna explode. More and more people will keep coming here. If we don't help them, it will be a disaster ! We need to act now. Not just words, we need facts ! WAEL The smuggler promised we'll leave at 10. We'll meet him in Basmane Square. He'll take us to an island, it's 3 hours by bus. Then another 2-hour walk to the meeting point. What if too many people are there ? There is no way back. The people at the meeting point are all armed. What if someone gets scared ? They will force you to walk at gunpoint. Do you know how much you have to pay to get there ? I have no idea, we will see... Between 2000 and 3000 Euros, it depends. From where to where ? From there to Germany. THE EXTENDED ORFAHLI FAMILY WAEL, DOHA, SIDRA,HUSAM, HUMAM, SIMA, TAESYR, RIBAL, HADI Sit over there son, I'm waiting for a phone call. I'm waiting for the smuggler to call me. He is calling you tonight, right ? We have to wait for the smuggler to tell us. The weather doesn't look good... Son, go charge the phone, because we're leaving soon. Most people left Syria seeking peace of mind. I would leave my house in the morning not knowing whether I would come back. A rocket, an air strike, anything can happen and you disappear. Thieves, thugs, militants could abduct you. It's the hardest thing one can ever do. Good morning, Abu Mohammad. I'm good, how are you doing ? Are you sure that we're leaving tonight ? Sure, no problem. We'll pack our luggage and get going. I'll come with my nephew at first, then I'll call the rest of the family to join us. My brothers are going to transfer the money to my sister in Istanbul. Yes, yes, I bought the life preservers and everything is ready. Didn't we buy the same brand last time, Wael ? The same one they took from us ? Please, my dear family, be careful. Yamaha life jackets are poor quality. Each life jacket should cost 60 Euros. Please be careful, this is going to save your life. They told me that the original ones can float between 3 and 3.5 hours. Sima, come ! Look at that. It's a good one. If Sima falls in, she'll float like this. You'll float in the sea. One for you, one for you, and one for Husam. The tire is better though. If the police arrest us, they will take the life jackets. You see ? It is filled up with air now. It's better. Let me see ! Dad, let me see if it's my size. - Yes. - Yes, it is my size. If we get arrested by the police, your mom will hide it under her clothes. They won't see it. I asked him if there is a trip today, he said yes. Sure, I'll send you the location before we leave. I am going to the meeting point at 5 PM and then he comes to pick us up. ON THE WAY TO THE MEETING POINT THE FAMILY IS SEIZED BY THE POLICE AND SENT BACK. I just want to go, I'm tired. I really am. We left Syria 20 days ago. We're still in the same mess. I swear, we are about to break down. We're really struggling, it's never been easy. We just want to get there. DAMASCUS SYRIA She's going to kiss you again. Look at that face ! Husam. Come, so you can be in the video with your siblings. What are you doing ? Why the face ? Wael. Humam, Sima ! And this is Husam. - And this is Wael. - Hi, hi. Doha ! Do you want to see what it looks like now ? Look, they just sent it to me. - Our building ? - Our building. This is ours. Oh my God, what happened when the rockets hit the building ? Yes, half of your house has been destroyed. The same happened to my house. Look at how our apartment is now. I want to get it over with. I feel like I am about to explode. You know the situation. It's 8 of us, we just want to leave. I must leave today. I'm in a hurry because of the bad weather. I told you not to say anything to Shadi until I figure out what to do, but you did ! - You said you wanted to. - No, I didn't want to ! Wael, don't leave. It's very dangerous. You're getting on a rubber raft, not on a wooden or steel boat. I don't care if I die. I just want to leave. I must leave by today. I just need to get to Greece, I want to get out of here. This is insane. If it's meant to be, we'll leave tonight, if not, then tomorrow. Let's wait and see what will happen. I just want to have peace of mind, I just want to cross the sea and get there. I just want to cross the sea and for the kids to survive. Just leave. We're not going to wait forever. It's hard to sit and wait. You keep asking me "What's wrong ?" I'm about to break down. You were making fun of me yesterday. You don't know what I'm going through. We were joking, not making fun of you. You said that I'm not good at leading the trip. But you see what's happening with us. You get too sensitive. I'm sensitive because I'm carrying all the responsibility. - You carry all the responsibility. - Yes. But when you carry all the weight on your shoulders, you break down. It's okay. You have to think about the smuggler, the money, the sea, the weather... I have a hundred things on my mind. I hope everything will be okay, God willing. MESSAGES BETWEEN WAEL AND HIS SISTER We're leaving now, we don't know what's going to happen. Wael, please cancel your trip for today ! Go back now and postpone until tomorrow. We're with you Wael, until death. MESSAGES FROM DOHA TO THE FAMILY The waves are very high. Oh God, oh God, oh God ! Keep tracking us, I sent you the location. The boat is full of water, people are trying to empty it. Pray for us ! Call the Coast Guard to help us. The waves are very high, we're afraid. The boat is filled with water. We have children. Please call the Greek Coast Guard now. LAMPEDUSA From the moment you start your journey, it's a chain. You see, the main smuggler... You only communicate over the phone. The people who emigrated abroad, friends or people you grew up with, they help you a lot. Maybe they are from the same village, same town, maybe the same school ... They help Some say, "I could only send you $500." "I will send you $200." You collect it all to come here. I was working as a guardian of prison in a military prison. Our salary is not more than $10 per month. I was a soldier for 15 years. These 15 years... This is my golden age to work, to earn some money. It's my golden age to make a family. Because of the forced military in Eritrea, every time you have a fear you might be captured, you might be arrested by policemen. You can't be free in your country... This is the 36-year-old captain responsible for the death of 366 migrants off the coast of Lampedusa. He's been identified for his light skin by some of the survivors. TG2 EXCLUSIVE I am here because of this tragedy... Because of the boat that sank... Are you a professional boat smuggler ? No, I am not. I am a fisherman. What do you mean by "boat smuggler" ? Do you mean if I am a boat smuggler by trade ? No, I'm not I am a fisherman, but I also work as a bricklayer. - Did you drive that boat ? - Yes. It's not my fault... Really, it's not... Yes, I am responsible, but I am not to blame for the tragedy. Water was leaking into the engine. Something was wrong with the engine. So I took a T-shirt. I dipped it in gasoline. I held it in my hand. I lit it to call for help. I heard the immigrants scream. AGRIGENTO CRIMINAL COURT Bensalam Khaled, alleged boat-smuggler. Mehari Aregai. He is not only a witness, he is also under investigation for illegal immigration. He has the right to remain silent. How much did you pay for your own trip ? I traveled with a cousin. He isn't alive, he died in the shipwreck. He was the one who paid for my trip, because he had help. - It cost $3600, but I paid $3000. - It was your cousin who paid. I start from Eritrea from the small city of Teseney. It's near the border of Sudan. So there are brokers smugglers who work for this. After three years that I stayed in Sudan, we travel to Libya. We don't know which way we are going and how we cross. Where is the border, which is the border... We don't know about this. All our bodies are full of lice. All the mats are full of lice. Forget about food, forget about drinks, forget about the toilets. There is a rope for climbing on the boat ... So you can hang on the rope... They would put a gun on your head, even to get up on the boat, they hit you. At this point let's proceed with the captain identification. First from the photo album, and then in person. Ask Mr. Mehari to approach the cell, see if he recognizes the person. Like I told you before, because it was quick, I can't recognize him now. I have no more questions. ISLAND OF LESBOS GREECE - You just arrived today ? - We just arrived today. Yesterday one of the boats sank. Go, try to catch the ferry, it is leaving for Athens at 10 PM. Stay in front of us. Husam, stay in line. Where are the kids ? Husam, Humam, Sidra... Sidra, Husam, Humam ? Where are the kids ? Sidra ? Husam ? Have you seen them ? How did that happen ? Sidra, Husam, Humam ? - Three kids ? - Yes. The kids should have stayed close to us instead of them sitting alone in the front ! - How old are they ? - 10, 8, 7. Dahleh, with a D ? - How old are you ? - 27. They found them, they found them ! It's good that we got lost, we saw a lot of beautiful scenes. REFUGEES CHARTER FERRY TO THE GREEK MAINLAND We're in Athens now, which is in the south. You crossed to Athens by boat. We're going to take the bus to the border with Macedonia. We go to the square, and we check what people are doing and we do the same. Serbia, then Croatia. Hungary. This is Austria. So we change from bus to bus, from train to train, until we get to Germany, it's non-stop. This map makes one dizzy. So it's another five countries. And the sixth is Turkey. Lebanon the seventh, and Syria was the first ! Where is Germany, where is Germany ? There are 4,000 people at the border. They have to wait and they almost die in order to get papers. They do make it, but the problem is the cold. You might not find a place to sleep. We'll just wear several layers and that's it. - We don't have jackets either. - No we don't. You don't have enough clothes for your children ? No, this is all they have. Germany, Germany, we're going to Germany. I want to go to Germany, but I'm going to freeze on my way there. Germany, Germany, I'm going to Germany. We always laugh and joke, to make it easier on ourselves. If I showed my kids that I'm afraid or sad, they would be afraid too. My kids don't know where they're going. They don't know why they're here. Bye ! ITALIAN TOWN OF RIACE WHERE HUNDREDS OF REFUGEES ARE RELOCATED You see ? It's a lot of work. Do you dry the figs inside ? Yes, come and look. First I dry them, then I splash them in boiling water to disinfect them. Then I lay them down to dry. If it's sunny, they dry fast. You see, this is ready. My dad emigrated to Argentina, my mother stayed behind When did people begin to emigrate to America from here ? During World War II. At that time everybody would leave. There was nothing to eat, everybody fled to America. ITALIAN NATIONAL ANTHEM PLAYING DOMENICO LUCANO MAYOR - How many are there ? - In Riace ? Over 200. The whole world is here, you see ? Mayor Lucano, another government official is visiting Riace today: Minister Kyenge. Welcome Cecile Kyenge, Minister of Integration Riace is a town of 1,800 people. This is a land of social hardships and heavy unemployment... Notwithstanding our difficulties, we have opened our doors to the world. Besides the migration model you created, there is also a sense of solidarity that entire Italy should bring out. The earth is not ours, the earth belongs to everyone ! Riace used to be a town with houses with no people. A town of people leaving. Our people went abroad in search of a better life. Nobody could imagine that in a place where everyone was leaving, one day new people could arrive. Ali, how many do you need ? Do you want me to fix your shoes ? Yes... do you want money for it ? You don't have any, right ? I knew it. Why did you pull it ? One piece is here, but the other isn't. Where did you put it ? It broke. Where did you put the broken piece ? - It must have fallen off. - How can I fix it now ? I do not have any white pieces. Let me see... All these immigrants coming to Italy... Someone over there must have told them that this is America. But in Italy they go hungry now... We spoke about this already ! I can't sleep anymore, I'm always thinking about my papers... They called me saying that my documents would arrive today. The project ends on December 31st. What are we going to do without documents ? They'll kick us out ! I've been waiting for the papers for one year, this is not good. Thanks ! I am not the Italian government ! I have just called the immigration department ! There is a long list of people waiting since last April. Just because I am the Mayor here, they think that I am the Italian government ! They are all in my office. They think it is up to me to give them visas, I am just the Mayor of this little town. You are not paying utilities, you are not paying rent... We have no jobs, we have nothing to do. We want cable TV just to kill time. Cable TV is not a basic necessity. Stop it ! I am on the battlefields ! I went on a hunger strike to get Federal funds for the refugees. We constantly live in a precarious situation. My own children are unemployed... My wife works in a bakery, it's a humble job. AFTER HIS DEPOSITION IN COURT, AREGAI GOES UNDERGROUND. We are now arriving at Roma Tiburtina. ROME SQUATTER SETTLEMENT FORMER GOVERNMENT OFFICE BUILDING THE BUILDING IS UNSTABLE AND MAY COLLAPSE In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit... - That's enough food Auntie... - Eat, eat. Yeah, we made it safely, we made it to Lampedusa... And God had other plans... The accident happened so suddenly after a 24-hour journey. After traveling crammed all together... What a disaster... This is the guy who rescued you ? The fisherman ? This is Domenico and he is Raffaele. You know what happened after court deposition ? They took us on a bus. We were nine and they were eight... - Police ? - Yes, one for each. Behind us there was another car with another eight or nine policemen. Just like thieves. We finished with court and were supposed to be freed, but they only increased their security. Inside the holding center it was like a maze, we were confined. I can't tell you how filthy the blankets were... They put a number on your wrist like dogs. The other 8 slept on three mattresses. They gave us one room and the smell was unbearable. A policeman tried to hold me. I told him not to touch me. If they are going to hold us, they will likely detain us for at least a year... I guess that's the reality. I said to myself, I have to go far from this place. - Where are we ? - I don't know. How many kilometers to the border ? 90, 95. - So we go direct to the border. - To Macedonia, super price. Fifty meters from the Macedonian border. How much do you want to pay ? - Tell me, tell me. - 200. For two taxis ? Are you crazy ? We still need to take a lot of buses and trains. We cannot pay that much. That's the last price for three taxis. All together. That's it. Finished. Three taxis. Dad, Dad... Dad. Dad, are you going to buy something to eat ? We can't buy anything. How much is it ? You think it's ok ? You still have enough ? IDOMENI BORDER WITH MACEDONIA When ? When you can go ? Now it's about group 72, you are 74. We stay together. For medical attention go to the designated area. Group 75 goes on the left. We're 75 ? Who told you that ? This is ours, put it right here. Have a seat next to your father. The border is a 5-minute walk, it's really close. The police will tell you when you can go, ok ? After you cross the border you have a train on the other side. ITALIAN TOWN OF FALERNA WHERE ASYLUM SEEKERS LIVE IN AN OCCUPIED RESORT They shut off the water. Racists ! They're cutting the water pipes ! This is why we are protesting. I'm the mayor of Falerna, Giovanni Costanzo. It's about the situation at the Falerna refugee camp. Yes, it's been 2 years now... Until we learn where to transfer the immigrants, send us a water tank. Just as a temporary solution. I know... but I have a problem here, because if they can't bathe, we might risk an epidemic in the surrounding community. Listen, listen ! We've got nothing against you. 60,000 euros in water bills. It is a huge problem for our small town. How can we pay for water, for electricity ? When we bike on the road people say: "Look at this bastard who lives here for free..." I have nobody here, no mother, no father. They rescued me at sea and put me here. You don't understand. I am just the mayor here ! I am not the "boss" here. I have a responsibility towards the citizens. This is not my private property... The town is not the Mayor's own house ! If Italian people should work for you, they get paid 70 or 100 Euros a day. But when black people work, from morning to night, they pay them 15 euros ! A reasonable amount of immigrants could be acceptable, but this is an invasion ! We lack everything here ! Now they want to naturalize the immigrant kids too. Maybe one day, if we have space, but now we don't have any ! We, the people, are fighting a longstanding worldwide crisis. We are here to protest against what we do not like and what is not right. Our people are losing their jobs and their dignity. This is unacceptable ! This is a worldwide crisis. It started in the United States. I lived in America and went through the crisis over there too. Here we have Berlusconi who wants to fight the crisis and defend our homeland ! The Democrats should stop caring about drug addicts, gays and immigrants ! We Italians come first ! MACEDONIA Dad, pick some for me ! Come on, get up. Give some to your mom. Where are we going now ? I can't understand where this train is taking us. - To Serbia. - Aha, to Serbia. Once we get to Serbia, we can choose whether to go to Hungary or Croatia. We're can't cross through Hungary, there's a military checkpoint, we'll go through Croatia. Are we going to meet Uncle Thair once in Germany ? Let us cross the Serbian borders first. The first thing we'll do is eat. I'm hungry, I'm starving. Me too, only sardines. What would you like me to cook for you once we arrive there ? Shakrieh, Kebbeh, everything ! This is still Macedonia's side. From here we walk toward the Serbian border. There are buses outside to take you to the police station. After you get Serbian papers, you'll walk through Croatia, Austria, et cetera. Light up the way, maybe there's a wolf or a dog somewhere. SANT'ANNA DI CROTONE EUROPE'S LARGEST MIGRANT CENTER We want to take advantage of the Minister's visit to talk with her and tell her about our needs. Minister, what will you do about this camp ? We are a lot of people, we need to talk to her. We say "please speak" but no, no. They want to talk to her. Tell them something. She will meet some of you... Minister, come see this side, it's awful here ! It's awful here ! It's the flag of Somalia. Here it's very bad. It's the worst camp... It's the worst camp in Italy, there is no life. People stay here more than one year. I arrived in Lampedusa and they transferred me here. Here is a military zone, it's not a camp... We can't understand if we are prisoners or refugees. There are 1,500 people living in this camp now. What they ask first and foremost is that their human rights are respected. For the first time cameras were able to get into this camp thanks to the Minister's visit. Italy problem, Syria problem ! Immediate deportation ! Our agenda is simple. Immediate stop to immigration, deportation of all the immigrants. Let's stop this migration flow ! It's deadly for Italy and for the rest of Europe. We stand together with the nationalist movements in Greece, France, and Hungary. We also say no to immigration. My name is Aregai. Is the photo for the I.D. ? Can I take it with my mobile ? Okay, I'll send it to you. Let me know if it's okay or not. Yes, via Facebook is fine. I am adding you. It says Aregai Mehari... OK, bye ! 900 is too much... BINNI AREGAI'S COUSIN But this is not a must, we can try to go with someone else. Yeah, maybe someone cheaper, because 900 is too expensive. If he is going to use a fake Italian ID... There is no other option. Let's hope it'll be a peaceful journey. They're sending you with fake papers, we could have made it ourselves... These are nice pants, but you don't like dark. No, no, I have two pants, that's enough. This will be an extra change for you. When you do the check-in they will give you a boarding pass. It will indicate the gate number. Make sure when you are going to the airport that you look confident, because you'll have a fake I.D. You have to act like it's valid. Don't get distracted with other things. So they will not be suspicious and send you back. Do you understand ? Walk fast, move quickly and with confidence, as if you had a real I.D. I am happy you made it here. At least you survived out of three. I haven't done much for you. You didn't meet me at a time when I could have done more for you. You did more than enough. We have an hour, we better go. Do you have the phone number of the person who is meeting you in Stockholm ? When you get there and you pass through immigration, don't show fear. TOVARNIK CROATIA Hello ! - It's delicious. - Take a bite. We're going through the Hungarian and Austrian border. We don't have problem there, it's a European border. Everybody is taking that route. The bus is going to leave at 2 o'clock. - Leave the food here. - Everyone should carry one bag. I'm not going to carry anything, my back is killing me. What do you want to do now ? I will start packing the stuff. We're not going to carry all this stuff. We are tired from carrying all this stuff. We are just carrying extra water and extra food. We won't take anything else. Just our bags and jackets. LINZ AUSTRIA Because of the huge number of Syrian refugees in Munich, they don't apply immediately for asylum. You go to a camp, there's a tent there. You stay there from 1 to 4 days, then you get on a waiting list. And then you wait until you get the papers. It's going to be crowded in whatever camp you are sent to. Wael, it's going to be hard, but it all depends on how clever you'll be. I'm taking you to the train, we can get you shampoo, shaving cream, deodorant. You can get clothes for free, but take your bags just in case you don't find what you need. Let's either go downstairs or wait outside, people are staring at us. We feel happy actually. But I'm afraid not to see my mom again. It's not easy to contact them. It's very rare to have communication, I mean... There's no electricity, nothing. It's very rare. I'm trying to draw a heart, but it doesn't look good. Draw our house in Germany ! Our house in Germany ? - It's not good, but it's okay. - I know how to draw it. OHRDRUF GERMANY My brother is here, I want to meet him. No ! He's my brother, I just want to speak with him, it's been a long time I didn't see him. We don't want to take him and run away. "Orfahli." He has 4 children. AFTER 24 DAYS ON THE ROAD THE ORFAHLI FAMILY ARRIVES IN GERMANY SAFELY. FIVE MONTHS LATER, THE E.U. SEALS ITS BORDERS, LEAVING THOUSANDS OF REFUGEES STRANDED IN TURKEY. SINCE HIS 2009 ESCAPE FROM ERITREA, AREGAI IS NOW A FREE MAN IN SWEDEN WHERE HE HAS BEEN GRANTED ASYLUM. ERITREA HAD HAD NO NATIONAL ELECTIONS, NO LEGISLATURE, NO INDEPENDENT MEDIA SINCE 2001. RELIGIOUS FREEDOM REMAINS SEVERELY CURTAILED. ACCORDING TO THE U.N., ERITREANS REMAIN SUBJECTS OF ONE OF THE WORLD'S MOST OPPRESSIVE GOVERNMENTS. HE LIVES NEAR STOCKHOLM AND WORKS AS A COOK IN A REFUGEE CENTER. EVERY YEAR, ON OCTOBER 3RD, HE TRAVELS TO LAMPEDUSA TO COMMEMORATE THE 367 MIGRANTS WHO PERISHED AT SEA. We would've never thought of leaving, Syria was very beautiful before. I wanted my kids to go to school there, and for us to live our lives normally. There's nothing bothering us, thank God. There are different types of people here, there are people who like us and other people who don't, and it's normal. Wael is worn out psychologically. He misses Syria. I don't know what to do. In Syria, I had my family and friends around. Now I feel lost and lonely. We had a good life before, but now it's the kids' turn. WAEL, DOHA AND THEIR CHILDREN HAVE BEEN GRANTED ASYLUM IN GERMANY. THE FAMILY HAS SETTLED IN A SMALL TOWN SOUTH OF HANNOVER. After seven years of conflict, over 11 million Syrians, about half the population, have been forced to flee their homes. It's believed that hundreds of thousands have been killed. From 2011 to 2018 it's estimated that more than 18,000 people lost their lives crossing the Mediterranean trying to seek safety in Europe. The real figure of fatalities is unknown, since many deaths are never recorded.
