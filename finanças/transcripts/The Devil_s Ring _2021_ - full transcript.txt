Hi, honey! Home sweet home. So good to see you. Come in. I thought you were going to call us to pick you up. It's okay. I needed the walk. Julian, Danny, get down here. Your cousin's here. Aw shit! Goddamn, you getting big. Ain't no more little bro, huh? Big motherfucker. Julian, what's up? Ain't no more fucking spritz. Too loud. Let's get you all settled in. You can take the back room for now. No one's using it, so. Thanks a lot, tia. You didn't have to. You're my brother's son and I love you just like I loved him. In my home, you are always, always welcome. Thanks, tia. - Let's fix you up. - Let's go. Get up, let's get it. 15 more minutes. Julian, get up. Get up, come on! Julian, get up. Fuck. Shit. It's a marathon, you ready? Yeah, sure. Imma beat both of y'all. Don't know why y'all talking. - Fuck, man! - Hey, hey. Language. But considering, he was pretty close. He's on his way. Next time. So, what's up, Danny? You ready for tonight? Keep your hands up, baby! Keep your hands up! Hey, Roy! - What can I do for you? - Yo, man. Leo sent us. So you're the new guys? Nah, we ain't the new guys. We're just new players to the game. We're here to collect, Leo says you owe last month's and this month's pay today. I already spoke to Leo. You boys go on home now. The Harry Pott marathon is on. This guy got jokes, man. Listen here, Pops. Leo says you owe the money, we're here to collect. You either drop a deposit or get dropped. You're out of luck, boys. Child-support collected today. Be my guest. Take it up with them. Hey, what you got in that wallet? What's up, motherfucker? What's up? Man, get up, fool. He's a fucking boxer. Leo didn't say he was a boxer. Man, that's a tie. This a tie, man. You better have it next time, or there won't be a next time. Let's go, man. Need me to call the police? Don't bother. There'll be new stooges next week. That was intense. Old school. There's always that one guy from high school who never gets over his shit, an old friend turned foe who thinks I owe him something. That's Leo. He went big time, owns a few gyms, and he thinks I owe them something? I sure do. Kick in the ass is what I owe him. Back in the day, we sparred at the same gym. But then he got mixed with the wrong crowd, went on his own, and I think it really got to his head. Then we finally reunited years later in a title fight. He lost that night. Took it pretty bad. Well, we both lost that night, really. I'll get into that later. Shit! You been keepin' her clean? Yep. You've been driving her? Don't lie to me. No, but Danny has. Mamacita. Man, I missed you, baby. Oh, it's been a long time. Man, how I missed her. You and I had some good, good memories back then, huh? You ready for one more ride? Especially you back there? Oh, that's my baby! Man, how I missed you so much! Mr. Deville, one of the biggest promoters in boxing today, just got wind of Anthony's release. Unfortunately for him, this is them. They're not in it for the sweet science. They're in it for the money. I love the whole layout. It's a very nice restaurant. Thank you, I just bought it. Little girl run along, men's business. I'll text you later. Thanks for accepting this meeting. Welcome back to the free world. Thank you, sir. It's a great feeling. I know. I've been there. Thank you for the invitation. So, I hear you're getting back into the ring. Must be very exciting. Five years is a long time to think about. You still got what it takes? I hope so. Only one way to find out, right? You know, time is our worst enemy. And by the looks of it, you don't have much time left. It's exactly why I can't waste it. I know it may not work out, but I'm fine with that. I'll be very upfront with you. I think you're wasting your time with Randy. You've got to strike while the iron is hot. And I can get you there. I appreciate that but... You want to be remembered forever, don't you? That's what this is all about, right? Now, do you want to be remembered as a champion... or just another Mexican, never counted in, and forgotten? You want your shot? This is it. You fight my best two prospects in a four-round matchup. If you win both fights, you get a shot at the undercard. I can make that happen. That's amazing, but what are you asking? If you lose just one fight, you will sign to a three-fight deal of our choosing. And you will throw two of the three fights. That's the deal. I don't understand, but why? You don't understand! I think you understand. It's just business. - It's not the way I operate. - Now, what the fuck? You sound like a beta bitch to me. Now you got the stuff but you're gonna run nowhere. And I can make you a world champ. But you've got to do it my way. Now I'll even throw in a signing bonus. Small gesture... of my appreciation. This is my only offer. You'll get a shot. And I'll get your soul. Okay, so, I'll take hot wings as payment. Um, I don't think so. You don't like hot wings? Of course I like hot wings, but you're paying for them. When did we come to that agreement? When you took this job! I ain't seen that in the fine print. Ah! There it goes. Lemon pepper. Okay, you got me. You can put them on my desk at lunch and I'll take a Big Red on the side with a ranch. Thank you. You're so kind. She likes me. Hey, Roy! I got a message for you. Leo wants his money, and you better pay up. Oh, well, I don't owe Leo shit so tell him to go fuck himself. Oh yeah? Well... I'm here to collect. If anyone is going to fuck themselves, it's gonna be you. Now, get the fuck out of here. Tell Leo he ain't getting shit! Good news boss, they just offered me a contract last night. The Deville promotions. Bueno Anthony. I don't think that's a good idea. Why not? Because this man is dangerous. Who? Deville? He's just a promotor who wants to help. He is bad news. - I know what is right. - But the contract is signed, Randy. One check for you and one for me. I'm sorry, but I can't be a part of this So what are you saying? That you won't be my trainer? You should of asked me first So why the fuck are we doing this, this same fucking routine? Who else is going to work with me? But not like this Anthony! I have a family to think about. I can't get mixed up with this guy. You're exaggerating. Well, this is where we end. Good luck. Are you serious? Randy? I'm sorry, Leo. I messed up. Things didn't go as planned. I think I have a couple broken ribs. Bruno, are you fucking serious? I send you to go do a job and you come back to me looking like that? You're a fucking disgrace and you're making me look bad. Get the fuck over here. Come here. Let me see your ribs. Where does it hurt? Right there. There? Leo, come on. Now, get the fuck out of here before I fucking finish you off. Hey, Frank, how soon before you can get to my place? I have a little job I need you to take care of for me. Feels great to be back. All that time away really help me appreciate the little things in life, the moments that really matter. This time is going to be different. I'm going to lead by experience to guide my younger siblings in the right direction, especially Danny. Him being my half-brother, I know we didn't spend a lot of time together after our father disappeared, what better way to bond than boxing in the ring? To teach them all the lessons our father taught me: endurance, discipline and dedication, not being distracted by other things. Anthony? Hey. I'm home. I'm happy to see you. I'm glad you're out. I'm surprised you still remember me. Come on. Hasn't been that long, has it? Look, I'm happy to see you. But I told you how things work. And they still are? Anthony, I'm getting married. Oh, okay. I see. I can't do this right now. I remember sitting in my Honda Civic, when I used to park right there. Around the same time. Things change. You made your decision a long time ago. I'm happy to see you, but please don't come by again. Take care of yourself. Hello, sir. What can I do for you? Hope I didn't catch you at a bad time. A friend of mine recommended you. Cash or check? Cash, man. We offer 179.99 a month for two sessions a week. It's a bit more complicated than that. I got myself into some mess and I heard you were the one I needed to talk to. Is that right? Well, I'm not a counsellor, I'm a boxing coach. And if you're here to box, we offer 179.99 a month for two sessions a week. Cash or check. I understand that, but this is something else. Just hear me out, please! What's up, kid? I've got a business to run here. I made a deal... and it wasn't exactly what we agreed on. Never is, is it? No. The tempt for greatness is the biggest drug in the world. So you've met Deville. Well, you're shit out of luck. They've gotten you like they've gotten others. Don't waste your time, kid. I can't help you. Okay. I get it, I won't bother you. But I'm gonna do this regardless. Is there any advice you can give me? It's not just the physical pain. What you see in that ring. When you look at them, they look right back at you. It's pain. A lot of pain. I can take it. I'm sorry, kid, but like I said, for the last time, I can't help you. Now go on, go out and find someone else that can. This isn't the place and I'm not the one. Hello, ma'am. You need some assistance? Why, yes, thank you. It's no problem. You're very kind. What was your name again? It's Roy. Very nice to meet you, Roy. I'm Mary. Mary, it's a pleasure to meet you. Cold weather this afternoon, huh? Are you waiting on someone? Oh yes, my granddaughter. She'll be here in a minute. - She just got off work. - Yes, ma'am. Looks like your ride. Yes. My granddaughter. Hi, Granny. So sorry I'm late. Long day at work. Oh, that's all right. Services just got out. And besides, I had nice company. Oh, thank you, young man. You've been very kind. Not a problem. Glad to be of service. Thank you for waiting with her. - Really. - It's no big deal. We're going to go grab some lunch at Joe's Pizza. You want to come with us? Uh, thanks, but I gotta get going. Oh now, Roy, don't be stubborn. Granny! We're just gonna be a few minutes. It's the least we can do. Okay, sure. Why not? Okay, well, follow us. I'll follow you. Veggie Pizza. So let's cut to the chase. What's your story? Are you married? Are you on the run? - What's your story? - Granny, what... I'm so sorry. She could be quite a character. Oh, nothing wrong with it. It's an honest question. I understand it's not a big deal. No, I'm not on the run, thank God. I'm divorced now, 17 years. Two boys, they're older now, living their lives. And here I am living my own. Boxing has been a big part of my life. Always has been and always will be. So, were you a boxer? Yeah, used to be a long time ago. Isn't that kind of dangerous? Well, the key is not to get hit for the most part, you know? What was your worst injury? I did get headbutted once. The fight almost ended right then and there, but I ran right through it. Wow. It seems like it's really physical and demanding. Yeah, I mean, we do train for months before a fight, so it does take real discipline. Dig in, Granny. I think, honestly, I can do better than this. Okay, if you say so. Okay? I tell you what, Roy, I'll just invite you over one night and let you be the judge. Who am I to say no to a cooked meal? - Just let me know when. - All right. We will. Hello, excuse me, aren't you...? Ah yes, Mr. Deville's woman. One of several. The one who gave me the smirk. Exactly. Well, sorry for not returning the favor. Let me introduce myself... I know who you are. I do thank Mr. Deville for the opportunity. You know he owns you now. I'm just happy to be here. Trust me, we're all happy you're here. But, you should get going, you shouldn't be around me too long. Why's that? Because bad things happen when I'm around. You should go. I'll take your word for it. It was once said the fight is won or lost, far from witnesses. Behind the lines, in the gym, or out there on the road, long before we get to dance under the those lights. You got to fix that defense. How long you been training, kid? Five months. - What's your weight? - 170. If I do this, I want you to fully understand what you're getting yourself into. I don't want you blaming me if things don't go well. And they never do. Only few have completed what you're attempting. His two best, I've seen them. This is a mental and physical pain unlike anything you will experience on this Earth. And what you will see in that ring, there are no words for. It is hell! This will be a literal fight for your soul. This is The Devil's Ring. If you lose, eternal damnation, but if you win, you get your soul back. How is it set up? This won't be sanctioned boxing. This is an underground terminal. This is crazy. Don't count the days. Make the days count. Hey. Do you have another? Yes. Isn't this bad for your training? Sometimes. Is something wrong? Nothing. You can talk to me. I can't concentrate. And it's affecting me in the ring. Well, maybe you need to take a break. I can't. That's why I told you to talk to Beto, to keep you busy. Anthony, if you don't tell me what's wrong, I can't help you. It's because they screwed me in a deal, and this guy's sick way of letting me go, is to fight his best 2 fighters. Well don't do it, and there. It's not that simple, it's a deal. Only way out is to fight. Well, we have to get you a lawyer. Like I said, only way out... is to fight. You're going to take a beating. All I know in this life is to fight. I've fought since I was born, I've fought in jail, I got this. And if you lose? Anthony, you don't need anything to prove to anyone. Think about your life, you can still get out of this. This is not what your father would have wanted for you. I know, you all have boxing in your blood. Everyone wants to be like Uncle Paulie, perfect. But do it right! You can still get out of this. That's not what I am. That's not who we are. That's the family arrogance. I will face my consequences. I got this. You are right, I have enough problems as it is. I don't want to add problems to your list but, I saw Casper driving by here. Really? I tell you now, because when you see him, I don't want any trouble. We'll see. No, no, now I have you here with me. And you're not going to bring this shit to my house, I have Julian to think about. But he destroyed my life, Tia! Forgive him. Forgive him and let it go. It's Eye for an Eye, and he knows it. But that's not the way. Like I said, I appreciate you, but there will be a day, Hey, you must be Mr. DeSilva. I am. How can I help? They call me Crazy Frank. Leo sent me here to give you one last chance to pay up. You know what's best for you? You better pay up. Because you might not get another chance. Let's see. Option A. I can pay Leo a million cash, or option B, I can sign over my boxing gym to Leo today. How about option C? I don't pay Leo shit and I take that bat and I shove it up your ass. Now get the fuck out of here before you have a hard time explaining to your surgeon why you got a bat shoved up your ass. Fucking guy. Roy, old friend, how's it going? I see you've been getting my messages. Nice work. No problem, anytime. I really hate having to walk down here. I know you know I own a few gyms. So, this is really an inconvenience. I hate to break it to you, Roy, but you're long past due. 20 years to be exact. Now, I don't think you understand. I need my money, and if I have to come down here again, I can guarantee you it sure as hell won't be my errand boys delivering the message. I'm a reasonable guy, but a debt is a debt and I need to collect. Sure thing, Leo. Love what you did with this place. Nice work. Very impressive. I have to set you up with my contractor for the flooring. He's a very nice guy. Tell him I sent you. Thanks. I'll be all right. I hope to hear from you soon, Roy. Come on! Remember defense! Be ready to read 'em. You don't mind me asking, what happened to you? Did Deville make you do the same thing? Yes. I made it to the second fight. I lost that fight that night. I saw... faces in the ring. People I've hurt. I just couldn't beat them. Not because I wasn't strong enough. But inside, I was broken at the sight of that. My guilt. What I'd done. And what it's costing me. So I went forward to throw the fight as planned, and I backed out at the last minute. So... I broke the deal. And they held my contract, I could never fight again. I won the fight, but I lost everything. Now let's go. Mr. Roy DeSilva. Greetings, Deville. This meeting's been a long time coming. We are overdue. For sure. That we are. Well, I've been informed you decided to train our young prospect. I'm just his trainer. Come on, Roy. Why are you doing this? I'm just helping the kid out. You've been down this road before, you know what's ahead. And it's not just him, but for you. I've already lost everything. There's nothing else. Oh, I think there is. What do you want? It's not a good look for business, Roy. It's not. Leave it alone, it's your only warning. I'll see what I can do. This time won't be like the last time. I'll take everything you love! And I'll turn it on you. Check, please. My motherfucking man! Boy, I knew you'd come through. Always coming through, baby! - Man, let's get it. - You got this, kid. You got this. Remember, we're doing this for Deville. I want you to make me look good. You go in there, and you get the job done! You got this! This is what you trained for. I want you to get in there. Work the body. Body, head. Body, head. Work those angles. Remember what I taught you. Get in there, work those combinations. Back in your corners. Let's go. Come on. Just like we trained. Come on! Jab! Get off the ropes! Keep moving. Make a mess, make him pay. Just relax, okay? You're doing great. You want to win this fight? Now, you gotta focus on the fight. I'm fucking trying, man! Remember, we doing this for Deville. Do not make me look bad. He can hit harder and be stronger, but he's not smarter than you, Anthony. You get back in there. Work that defense. Boxers. Second round, second round. Come on. One more round. Okay? This is what we're here for. Now, you give him hell! Yeah! Footwork! Defense! Boxer, come here. Below the belt. One point. Let's go! What are you doing? Come on, work, work! Push him! Defense! Damn! Damn. Keep the other one up, okay? Feel the weight. Hey, babe. I locked the back door, make sure you lock the front. I'll see you at home. Watch your defense. When you throw a punch, keep the other one up. Okay? When you're tired, that's when the fight starts. Okay? Come on, dig deep. Let's go. One, two. Don't wait. Be the aggressor. Be the aggressor. That's it. Good job. There you go. Now you got it. There you go. Santiago. You got a moment? All right, hang on a second. All right, sit down. Remember your stance, your defense. Keep your arms up when you're punching. Good defense, all right? Why don't you go take a water break, then hit the bag, all right? I found out who took your tools from your truck the other night. It was Marcus. $40, said he'd get your stuff back. Yeah, is that right? He's falling on hard times, man. I was with him all morning. He really feels bad. Wants to make it right. You understand, right? I understand. Fuck Marcus. You gonna come in here and disrespect me in front of my kid? I should fucking kill you. You tell Marcus, I'm gonna be seeing him real soon. Get the fuck out of here. Go! Anthony, I'm sorry you had to see that, all right? Some punk needed directions. Now, listen to me, just because you saw me fighting doesn't mean you got to go out looking for a fight. Sometimes... it's not in your control. And when that happens... you've gotta make a decision. And when you do, you've got to own it. And if you do that... you're never gonna be wrong. You understand me, son? All right, come on. Let's get back to work. My dad, the strongest man I ever knew. He was always in my corner even when I didn't know it. Then, one day, somebody showed up and shot him. And that was it. Anthony! Ant! I ought to break your fucking face right now. Hold on, man. Can I speak? You sure got some nerve, don't you? Look, I heard you was out. Saw you walking down the street. - So listen... - No, you listen. I did five years in that cell, and I had a lot of time to think, Casper, and I couldn't think of one fucking reason why you set me up like that. Look, man, I was under a lot of shit. That's no excuse and you know it. Wasn't supposed to go down like that. That's just the way things played out, man. I lost everything. I lost my scholarship. Sandra left me! I lost my whole fucking life because of you. I ain't here to apologize. I know you ain't gonna accept it. I just wanted you to understand what happened. You ain't ever feel desperate? To have no options, nowhere to go? The only reason why I don't break you right now, is because we're in public. Do it, then. Trust me. I've imagined this five years. Shh, just run home. I see you around, ese. I take that as a compliment. It's an experience, no doubt. You know, I'm thankful for the opportunity, but... I just don't know if it's what I want. But, hey, I get to wear a suit. - Ooh, big guy, huh? - Mm-hmm. I'm sure you'll be a hit to the receptionist. Well... not for long. I kind of want to go into law enforcement. A cop? Yeah, I know what you're thinking. I've... I've thought about it too. It's, just, I like helping people. And as fucked up as it is now, I feel like that's where I can make the best impact. Your intentions are in the right place. I still have my doubt. But I guess that's life. Nothing's ever really laid out in front of you. This tastes fantastic. Oh, you're just saying that. No, ma'am. No, cross my heart. This is great. Well, I'll believe you then. So, Roy, how's work going? Actually, it's going great. Got a few new kids. And the first session's always the best. Tell me about your work, Roy. You said boxing is your life. Is this a family affair? Yes, ma'am. Actually, my dad was a boxer. He didn't get very far, but he did teach me everything he knew. Then I went at it professionally a long time ago. What happened? Well, I did get pretty far, but situations occurred and I had to do something different with my life. Oh, you don't have to go into detail. - I'm sorry. - It's okay, I don't mind. I did win a title fight. Mmm. Wait... As in a professional fight? Yes. Oh, my God. You never mentioned that! That's incredible. Well, that was such a long time ago. What was your record? 27 and two. Oh, my God! That's amazing. What... Why did you stop? What happened? - Action. - I'm Leo. Leo "The King of The Ring" Luciano, former boxing champ and head coach, Here, at Leo Luciano's Boxing Gym we only breed champions. So, come on down, sign up and train with us today. For more information, check us on the web, Or call us at 1-800-469-one-two, one-two. And cut. How was that? Did you get my good side? - Of course, I always do. - Are you sure? Because I didn't like that edit from last time. I looked like I ate seafood. My face was swollen. No. It was great. And we need hits on Instagram, Facebook and whatever the kids are into. We need this thing to go viral. What are your thoughts, Lisa? What do you think? I do have a few ideas. Something that catches the attention, the imagination. Altercation. Right. Let's do this. Excuse me, son. Please move, you're in my way. Yes, sir, can I help? Oh, so now you're gonna raise your voice to me? - What? I'm not. - What? You're gonna disrespect me in my own gym? - Come on. Put them up. - Man, fuck you, dude. Fuck me? No, fuck you. You're in my jungle now, kid. You want to step in the ring, I'll show you who's boss. - I'll beat your ass old-timer. - Oh yeah? Let's go, one round. You might be fast, but I hit you so hard, your great-great grandson gonna have black eyes. I made a bad business deal, then decided not to move forward. It just wasn't for me anymore. You must be very proud. Yes, ma'am, I did see the top of the mountain. That was enough for me. I do get my fulfillment, though, from the ones I train. Watching them achieve their accomplishments. Well, that's the important thing. Believe it or not, peace is what I value now. And for some reason, church is where I found it. Oh, that's so beautiful. I may have to start going more often then, huh? Trust me, you won't regret it. There you go, kid. Now you know why they call me King of the Ring. I've got to admit, though, you're really fast with the hands and you pack a powerful punch. Where you training at now, kid? Texas City Boxing Club. Let me give you my business card. Give me a call whenever you're ready to go big league. Okay. So what? Are you following me? Maybe. I'm not complaining. I'll have a shot of tequila straight, please. What part of Mexico? Chihuahua. Makes sense. You know... I've been around boxing my whole life. I see you, you don't seem to care. What gives it away? Sad look on your face. What are you talking about? I can see things. What do you see in me? Two DUIs, two assaults, should I go on? So, you have my case file. What, are you a cop now? I see anger. You've had it all your life. I'm winning but I feel like I keep losing. Makes two of us. Cheers. You know something? You're not so bad after all. What made you think otherwise? Hey, there's that motherfucker right there. Yo, we gonna follow him? Wait, that's his little cousin. Got me fucked up. Hey. Hey, get that nigga, dog. Get that nigga. Hold my beer, let's go. Hola. Yes, who is calling? What? Where... Where is he? The clock is up. It's time to pay up, buddy. My answer hasn't changed. Well, you've had enough warnings, old friend. You really want this, Leo? Right now's not the time. Don't think this is going to be like last time. Let me tell you something, I definitely won't have my guard down this time. A real fighter never does. Is that what you think? No, Roy, we had a deal. I honored the deal. You broke it. You never beat me. I let you. I understand your anger, Leo. I don't want to fight you. Well, that's too bad. Is that what you wanted? You motherfucker. Are you happy now? That doesn't change anything. It's over, Leo, you got what you wanted. Well, you're still in debt, for everything I lost. You're not getting anything from me. You're not blaming me. I don't owe you shit. He got us both. That was a long time ago. I lost just as much as you did. What I should do is put a bullet right in your fucking head, Roy, for what you did to me. You want to shoot me? Huh? Shoot me! Here. Let me give you my glasses so you don't miss like you do when you throw punches, you fuck! Fuck you, Roy. You know what? You're not even fucking worth it. Get this shit out of my face! Maybe I just need to let this thing go before I actually do something to you that I regret. It was a long time ago. I don't owe you shit. He got us both. But I wanted it more than you. I was the one who was in the gym, day-in and day-out. You came and gone as you pleased. You did it for the money. You took the deal and dishonored it, so you got what you deserved. But I had to pay for your decision. You thought you could just change your mind at the last moment. And you did without ever considering how it would affect anybody else in the deal. In the ring, you never beat me. I'm sorry, Leo. You're right. You are a great fighter. Better than me. I'll admit it. But I got nothing for you now. It's over. But what I at least need from you, Roy, is respect. You at least owe me that much. You are my brother-in-war. You have my respect. Tia, what happened? How did this happen? I told you not to bring your problems to this house. Not to bring your shit here! Julian was shot! Who was it? Casper? I received you in my house, and this is how you pay me? Please, please forgive me. I want you out of my house! Do you hear me? Get out of here! None of this would have happened if you were not here! I don't want to see you again! Get out! - What happened? - Bro. Bro. We gotta be together more than ever now! What happened? Tell me! They shot him? Casper, apparently. We're going to get 'em, right? We gotta lay low. What do you mean? We just to let him get away with it? The cops is all over this shit. Fuck that! I ain't waitin' on shit! Bro! Listen to me! You want to spend the rest of your life in a fucking cell? Boy, you're better than this. And you know it. We're gonna get him! Gonna have a cop in the family. This final lesson will be without me, as it is in the ring. Only you. I will give you an address. Follow this. It will lead you to a mountain in Colorado, a training area my trainer once sent me. And I think it could do you some good. There's nothing I can say or do that's gonna heal your pain. Only you can do that. But this mountain will decide your fate. No fancy quotes this time. When you return on your own, you will understand. Never enough, you naughty girl. Naughty. Double shot, Henny please. Santiago. I didn't expect to see you here. Not at all. Can't be good for your training. At this point, I don't even care anymore. Woah, champ, keep your chin up. She's getting married. Oh, well, scheisse! Make that two rounds. Thank you, dumplin'. So that's why you're doing this. Well, it's just as good as any other reason, I guess, to go out there and get your face punched. I don't even know why I'm doing this anymore. You've got the talent, kid. Just got to get your head in the game. You will be remembered. You will be great. I thought you wanted me to lose. No, kid, I want you to win. If you win, you get a shot at the undercard. If you lose... you sign to me to get the bonus. Throw a couple of fights. Then later you get the shot at the title. Where do you lose? Where do you lose? I just wanted things to go right. I'm just tired. That's when the real fight starts. When you're tired. That's when the fight starts. That's where it starts. Well, that was the seasoning. Yes, we need more of that. Well, I will keep that in mind. Thanks for having me over for dinner again. I'm sure you're getting tired of seeing me already. No, I'm not. I mean, that's why I've invited you here for... the eighth time? I'm thankful and I do appreciate the home-cooked meals. All right. I'll be upfront with you. I don't think you like my cooking. You're right. - The broccoli was off. - Wow. But your company more than made up for it. Okay, well, thank you for your honesty. I find you very interesting. See, that's why I bring you here. I have to tell you that... So... I just stepped on your toe. That's okay. So that's how you feel about me, huh? Among several other things. You don't have to throw out any lines. I'm not giving any lines. I very much enjoy your company. I'm going to take you to my favorite restaurant. Oh! But... Before you continue, I have something I need to tell you. Shh. What? You still married? No, God! God, no. No. Um... I'm moving away in two weeks. This great opportunity came up in Charlotte and I'm making a move. A friend of mine is a manager and he set me up with a really steady position. So, um, I'm... gonna go. This is gonna sound crazy, all right, but, um... Come with me. Candace, are you okay? What? Why not? My gym. So what? You can open one out there and expand your business. Come on, Roy, this is our fairy-tale ending. Just come with me. Just... think about it. It took me a while to understand that the world I knew, the world I left behind, doesn't exist anymore. And I made amends with that. And now... I only look forward. So you're going to watch me get my ass kicked this weekend? We'll see. Don't lose. I won't. Now, that's impressive. But once you wake up after the fight, where will you be? Still in debt to me. I'm not in this for me. Personally, I don't care what happens to me. Well, I have a deal for you. I can't have the boy winning so here's what I propose. He will lose the fight. Your debt is cleared. Simple as that. You want me to betray the kid? Is that what you're saying? You don't know him you don't owe him anything. This is your chance. A new life, debt-free. I never want to see you again. Oh, you will. Believe me. I've seen it. The extension is over. Your time is up. Make... the right... decision. You let me down, Anthony. You should have been there. C'mon! Defense. Let's go! Anthony! Jab! Footwork. Break! C'mon, defense! What's the matter with you, out there, huh? Way to go, champ. That's how you get it done. I'm fucking seeing shit, I'm hearing shit! - I can't do this! - Keep pushing. Be persistent. I can't do it, man! I see Daniel, Daniel's out there. I fucking let him down! It's not your fault, Anthony. You gotta do this. You understand? I... I can't do this! He's out there! You're here right now. This is what you wanted. You gotta do this, now, you got to fight! You let me down, Anthony. You should have been there. Let's go! Get off the ropes! Come on! Break. You got it! Let's go! Look at you! You failed! You weren't strong enough. Move! You're no champ! Break! Let's go. You got this. He's holding, Ref! C'mon. Get him off of him, c'mon! Way to go, way to go, champ. That's how you get around. That's how you win a fight. It's Daniel out there, man! C'mon, snap out of it. Huh? That's not Daniel! - Good job. - Stay persistent. Keep pushing. This cannot be the end. Not now. Okay? We've come too far! - Don't let up, pressure him... - I can't do it. - I can't fight him! - You too far in. Where were you? Weak. Anthony! Don't give up. You got to fight! Keep fighting! Break. Listen to me. You're here. Right now. You can't quit. You got to fight! Remember, you're doing this for you. You're doing this for me but most of all, we're doing this for Deville. I'm done, I'm dead! If you're already dead, you've got nothing to lose. Now finish this. Come on! Yeah! There you go! Jab! That's it. That's it. C'mon, get off the ropes. Give it to him! In the end, we all pay our debts. Karma is real, but at least for a moment, I had it all. And there's nothing I would do differently. But you can still see me every now and then dancing under the lights. And here we go, ladies and gentlemen. Get comfy tonight for this super welterweight division.
