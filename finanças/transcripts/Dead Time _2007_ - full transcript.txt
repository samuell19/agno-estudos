What I know is they just got off the bus. Then, suddenly someone cried 'thief!' - People started chasing him. - Who cried 'thief' the first time? I'm not sure, sir. Before I knew it, they were all over him. Who was the first to set him on fire? I just saw from afar, so I didn't see clearly. So many people, no witnesses. Because they all participated. You know that too, right? People burn buildings, attack whoever they want to. Now they've started to kill. And we're always too late. What should we do? Just arrest them all? Just one. - Which one? - The one who's a real devil. A metaphorical devil or a red man with horns, red eyes and a tail? You've misjudged. The real one is very smart and handsome. And he did this, too? You trust human beings too much. What if humanity hasn't come longer than this? What if this is just human nature? If that's the case, it would be pointless for us to be cops, right? Maybe. I don't know. Sir, a woman wanted to get on, why did you just drive? Did you hear me? - What's the name of the disease? - Narcolepsy, Sir. How is it related to him not being able to fulfil your sexual desires? Everytime I want to have sexual intercourse with him... he always falls asleep, Sir. - While having intercourse? - Before, sir. Is this everytime? It's not just when we want to have intercourse. He can't get too excited, frantic, mad, or scared. He'll surely fall asleep. How long have you known about his disease? Since before we were married, Sir. Why did you want to marry him then? His disease wasn't as bad back then. - Are you certain about your decision? - I'm certain, Sir. You don't love your husband? - Maybe I used to. - And now? No, Sir. I don't find their identities at all... I've already asked some witnesses. Excuse me. Is that the victim's wife, sir? I'm a reporter. The Chief of Resort Police already gave a press conference this afternoon. I just want to ask for an explanation, sir. I don't have the authority to tell to the press. It's better if you call the Chief of Resort Police. Excuse me. I'm from Metropolitan Post. Could we talk? Ms. Asih, I have some questions for our administration. Sorry, Mr. Sorry. There's a form that needs to be filled out. If you don't fill this out... we can't make a report to let you take this body home. Or do you have another family member that we can contact to help you? - Metropolitan Post, good afternoon. - Mr. Basri, please. Basri. Mr. Basri, I'm at the morgue. I've got news about the five people who were burned. - I already got it from Fendi. - I haven't seen Fendi here? He was there this afternoon and got the information from the police. But I've got the wife of one of the victims here. Maybe I can write from the humanitarian perspective? It's already complete. - Okay, I'll find another story. - There's no need, Nus. Actually, I hate to tell you this, but you'll find out soon enough anyway. About what? You'll be laid off from your starting next week. Why so suddenly? You already know they've held several meetings about you. But I've been getting better recently. I think you must find an easier job for you. I heard Tenggara was getting better. After separating from the Republic, he's been getting more and more in order. I want to move there next week. To find a job. Come with me. - I don't have the money to move. - Call Munawarman. He's a powerful businessman now. He gives envelopes to reporters. You make me frustrated, you know. But to me, a guy like you still have hope... that not everybody we see is a devil. Please, fill this out. What's this? Before taking the body home, you must pay the administration fee too. What recording is that, Nus? Nothing. It's at the Bendonowongso Hill. 7 steps before the temple. Bendonowongso Hill? I know the place. What's in there? I don't know. Whose voice is that? I don't know. Forget it. It's not important. If we move to Tenggara, you must speak to me more often. Otherwise, I'd be crazy to be friends with you. Bro, there's a man in my room. Who? A thief? I don't know. Please, check it out. - Want to move out? - Yes. - Where to? - Tenggara. You're lucky to be able to move there. Make sure to get enough sleep, Di. Otherwise you'll get hallucinations. After you left the restaurant, where did you go? Home. What did you talk to Bandi about before going home? - He said he wanted to move to Tenggara. - Why? He hates this city. How did he die? Maybe this city is cursed. Nobody can leave here. What did you and Subandi talk about? I already told everything to the cops just now. Tell everything once again to me. He just said he wanted to move to Tenggara. At the restaurant, you two were listening to a tape recorder. What did it say? Just an interview recording with a news source. What did that woman say? I don't remember. - What did that woman say? - I really don't remember. What's wrong with you? An officer just came in. Who just went in there? Who? Is he here? Get back! "Destroy immorality, protect the nation's morality." "Destroy immoral things for the sake of our children." "Don't let them become immoral." - Sumarsono Public Hospital, good afternoon. - Good afternoon, miss. I want the address of the pregnant woman who was hit by the car yesterday. - Excuse me, who is this? - I'm a reporter. Sorry, I can't tell you. I was the last one to interview her. And I was there when she was hit. I just want to send flowers to her family. Please. No one's here, sir. Is this Asih's house? Yes, but she was hit by a car yesterday and died. She was just buried this morning. Poor girl. Her husband also died from being burnt by a mob. And two days ago, her father, Ronggoweni also died suddenly. This family is really weird. People have been showing up here for a long time. Some government officials even came here several times. They came at night, so nobody would see. But we knew. - What did they want? - I don't know. - So, nobody's here anymore? - There is one. Mr. Ronggoweni's youngest daughter. - Her name is Ranti. - Where is she? - Probably at work. - Where? - The bar. - Be quiet. - Where are you going, bro? - I want to get in. Where to? It's just a warehouse. I'm Ranti's friend. I'm here to pick her up. Sorry to ask you to sing this night, no one else could fill in. Ranti, I'm Janus. I was there when your sister got into the accident. My deep condolences. Ranti, she told me something, but I don't understand what it means. - Whatever she said, don't tell me. - Why not? Because one of us must die. Don't tell anybody. What do you mean? Ranti, why can't I tell anyone? My friend was killed by someone. I'm sure all this is related. Please leave me alone. I just want to go home. And don't follow me. Help! Help! Help! Let me go! Help! Help! Janus, what did you talk about with Ronggoweni's daughter? I don't understand what you're talking about. Still don't want to talk? So, where's the place? What place? Try to say what you want. I also don't know how much we'll get there. But I promise you'll get your share. You will never have to work again. Your life will change. You can get treatment for your disease. I really don't understand what you mean. Answer! Want to talk or not? The next time you fall asleep, you'll never wake up again. Right. This isn't water. I'll ask you one more time. Where's the place? Want to go already? Usually, if you smoke, it means you're leaving. - I'm on duty. - That's not why, though, is it? It's far from the town center. But it doesn't mean nobody will come here. If a cop is scared of rioters... what will the hope of a common guy like me be? Storms will come, Eros. You can't outlast them by hiding. Ogoh-ogoh... What's that? In my neighbourhood, there's a ceremony of beating a statue every year. The statue is called Ogoh-ogh. After being beaten, it's burnt. In order to release stresses. So, the five people burnt yesterday were just because of stressed people? City people are stressed. It's hard to earn a living. If we run a business, people will ask us for money. Gangsters, officials... People's anger has piled up. When there's a chance, they'll release their anger. You also took part in burning those people? I go to my hometown every year, sir. I participate in the ogoh-ogoh ceremony. So, that releases my stress. - Did you see the incident? - Yes, I did. - Who did the burning? - The one who didn't is my friend, Mr. Sani. He was in the bathroom at the time. When he came out, he was sorry for not joining them. The person to blame the most is the woman who cried 'thief' the first time. Did you see that, too? I was taking a break when the bus came in. Then, five men got off. One of them was having an argument with the woman. Did you remember which man? He was wearing a necklace with a spider pendant. I remember that because I'm very afraid of spiders. Why were they arguing? I don't know, sir. But the woman had long hair. And she called the man 'brother', sir. The first to cry 'thief' was the sister of one of the victims. The strange thing is on the same day... the victim's wife was also hit by a car. And one day before that incident, the victim's father also died. There's no report about that. I'm suspecting that these deaths weren't normal. So, I ask for permission to dig up the grave to make an autopsy. Ros, I think it's a trivial matter that can be handled by anybody. - Trivial? I think this case is really... - I ask you to hand it over to your men. I'm ordering you. It's getting more chaotic. This country is breaking apart. I'm not too worried. I believe this nation will be united again. If only I was as optimistic as you. Jayabaya, the Javanese king, who's regarded to be able to predict... has predicted that all of this would happen. Chaos, disintegration... But it will get better. This nation will be prosperous. And I'm not the only one to believe this prediction. Many people do. What can make everything change? It's hard. The situation is already too bad. - The Just King. - What? King Jayabaya predicted that one day, there would appear a leader... who would bring this nation into a prosperous and safe nation. And he called him the Just King. At least, he still respected women. Anyway, we'd better talk about real things. Do you have any information for me? Whatever you found, you've made Bambang annoyed. What do you mean? It's rare for Chief of Resort Police to be called in by Chief of President's Household. - Why? - I don't know. What I know is from one telephone conversation, your name was mentioned. - Who told you? - Bambang's secretary. She hates that guy very much. After being taken for an out of town duty several times... she just got sexually harassed. And why do you have the family photo... of ex adjutant first President on your desk? When I was small and looked at the photo of the first President... I felt like he was a god. And this man was always behind the first President wherever he went. I know if it rains and it's cold, you'll certainly come here. - You've looked over my girlfriends, right? - If you don't come, nobody dare touch. People prefer watching TV. - I'll be a while. - You always are. I'll open the back door later. There'll be nobody stealing books in this city. Your boss doesn't get mad, right? If he does, he'll have to find someone else. Who else wants to work here, except an old spinster? I prefer meeting you here to the girls out there. That's why I still work here. Brother Eros... 'Treasure Hunting by the First President' Accept your destiny, Eros. We've been waiting for you. Ranti! Ranti! Ranti! You surprised me. I've been gone for three days and the place is a mess. I wonder what it'll be like in a year. Have you eaten? If not, I'll make something for you. Why are you here? After returning from court, I tried to take off this ring... but I couldn't. I always used to be able to. What does it mean? I couldn't sleep. My mind was tired, but I still couldn't sleep. I kept thinking about whether or not you ate. If someone was cleaning up the house. I was wrong. But if you don't want to accept me again, I understand. I just wanted to say sorry. Darling, calm down. If you calm down, you won't fall sleep. It's been a long time. It seems our problem was my fault. I forgot to tell you. You left me for 3 days. In that time some bad things have happened. - What do you mean? - Bandi is dead. Dead? How did he die? He was murdered. And I think it was related to the pregnant woman I met at the hospital. She was hit by a car before my eyes. Oh my god. Honey. And before she died, she said something in the tape recorder... that I hid in a pot. Why did you hide your tape recorder? I wanted to interview her about her husband who was burnt at the bus terminal. But she didn't want to speak. What did she say? In your tape recorder, I mean. - I don't dare to tell you. - Why not? Whatever she said seems very important. When I was questioned about Bandi's murder at the police station... there was an officer who came in and beat me. Then I met the younger sister of the pregnant woman who died. She also told me not to let anybody hear that recording. But you can tell me. No, I don't want to involve you. Okay, try to forget about that. If necessary, you'll find another job which is safer. I don't want anything to happen to you. - Hello? - It's me, Sari. - How did it go? - He believes I want to get back together. - Did he suspect anything? - Not at all. - So, he doesn't know about that place? - I don't know for sure. But it's clear that the pregnant woman said something... in his tape recorder before she died. Have you asked him what that woman said? Yes, but he didn't want to tell me. He didn't want me to get involved. You have to get him to speak. - What is that place? - It's of no use for you. The most important thing is that when he tells you, meet up with me. I'll give you the money as promised, cash. And don't forget. As soon as he tells you, give him the liquid I gave you. What kind of liquid is it? I'm getting bored of all your questions. Sir, I really need that money. But I don't want Janus to be harmed. Just do what I told you. Nobody will be harmed. I can't stop thinking about that pregnant woman, Nus. That poor woman. Her husband also died, right? No need to think about that again. - Do you know who burnt her husband? - I don't. What did that woman say in your tape recorder, Nus? Why? I'm just curious. You know if I'm curious, I keep thinking about it. Remember when we were dating... you once said someone liked me, but didn't say it was you. I kept thinking till I got sick. This one isn't that important. That woman told me about a place, but I've never heard of it. What did she say? The place is the Bendonowongso Hill, 7 steps before the temple. - I know that place, Nus. - How come? It's near my neighbourhood. We always pass that place when we go to my hometown. Which one? - The barren one. - Isn't that Wijoyo Hill? The name's the Bendonowongso Hill. When the governor was changed, the name was changed too. Want some coffee? Okay. Sari. Did you give Janus the liquid? I did. What place is that address? That's none of your business. Your business is just the money you'll receive. Now, tell me what you know. Not unless you tell me what place that really is. I've told you that's none of your business. Besides, it's of no use to you. I'm just surprised... why you asked me to poison Janus just to get that address. - How do you know it's poison? - Janus is dead. And now I want to know what that place really is. I could lie to you and you wouldn't know it. At least it would put my mind to rest. That's my father's grave. I don't believe you. Fine. Never mind if you don't want to tell me. But it means our deal is off. The Bendonowongso Hill. 7 steps before the temple. That's it? That's it. - Are you sure Janus is dead? - Yes, I'm sure. Now, where's my money? Sari, what if we moved to Tenggara? Sari? 'Sorry, darling. I'm curious. I want to find out what that place is.' Shit! As reported sometime ago, there was a body found. The body of the Minister of Tourism and Culture, Harry Wibowo... was found dead in the area of Cikedah. The police are still not willing to explain the cause of his death. But not far from that spot, a woman was also found dead. From the identity found, her name is Sari Haryati. It's not yet known if her death is related to the death of Harry Wibowo. The first person to find her body said the victim got shot in her belly... Ros, I'm used to holding a camera... an operation knife, but not a shovel. Calm down. You'll use an operation knife, but we have to dig up the grave first. What do you expect to find by digging up Ronggoweni's grave? I want to make sure he was killed. That everything isn't just a coincidence. The treasure of the first President. Is there that possibility? All this crime caused by that illogical legend. So, you don't believe the story about that treasure? Where did the first President get that treasure? The history about the prosperity of this nation under previous rulers... that you read in the school textbooks isn't bullshit. This nation used to be very rich. Where did that wealth go? Maybe it's already used by other nations to dump the sea and build cities. It means you can't imagine how rich we were long time ago. If the first President knew about that treasure... why wouldn't he use it for himself? As far as I know, he was the poorest ex president. And the most honest. How many honest, rich men have you ever heard about? I've read a lot of stories about that treasure. And I know businessmen, politicians, even ex-presidents... have secret organizations to find out where the treasure is hidden. I wonder if it exists or not. One thing is sure. Many people died and I'm sure the killers are human beings too. We don't need to check the graves one by one... till we find Ronggoweni's, right? It's useful to be friends with a caretaker. All guards were ordered to go home. We can take as much time as we need. I prefer digging up a grave with many people. What is it? I want to go back. I want to get tissue. Stop! Please, don't hurt me. We're cops. We won't hurt you. Ranti. How do you know my name? I'm in charge of investigating the case of your brother-in-law. We also know you were the one who cried 'thief' to him... so he was chased and burnt by the people at the terminal. Why did you do that? Okay, I'm not going to let you go until I get an answer. What do you want? I'm sure your father died of unnatural causes. And because it's impossible for me to get your explanation... we must make an autopsy. Please, don't disturb my father. I'll tell you the story. My father knew about the treasure of the first President. We know that already. He told me only one person could know the location of that treasure at a time. What do you mean? If more than one people knows, the others must die. Who made that kind of regulation? I don't know. But I know it's certainly true. My brother-in-law once... forced my father to tell and he threatened to kill me. Finally, my father told him. And because he was afraid my brother-in-law might be harmed... he killed himself. My brother-in-law told my sister. And he asked four of his friends to go to that treasure location. And since you were afraid something might happen to your sister... you shouted at your brother-in-law and his friends to be killed at the terminal? My sister was pregnant. I loved her. That means there's one person who knows where the treasure is. You? A man came to my job. And he said my sister told him something before she died. This case is getting stranger. If it's true that just one person knows where the treasure is. Then who killed those people? History, Ros. - The key is just history. - What do you mean? If you read the history of other countries... you'll read about scientific inventions like electricity and steam engines. But everything related to the history of this country is mystical. Smell these books, Ranti. If peace had a smell, this would be it. No need to worry. This is the safest place in this city. Here it is. Sometimes, the most accurate place to ask... is the source never seen by people. That treasure was the gift of Nusantara kings... as the capital to establish a united country. The first President realized if people knew about that treasure... there would be a disintegration in order to fight for it. The first President then ordered 9 of his trusted men to hide that treasure. Including your father, Ranti. Ronggoweni. - Ask them to move in advance. - Yes, sir. Move. You don't believe that bullshit, right? That everyone who knows about the treasure will die, except for one? I don't. - So, why do it like this? - Just in case. I think this creature has always guarded the treasure's secret. But according to this book, this creature can't kill. Creatures from the supernatural world can't kill human beings. It means the ones who've killed those people... are human beings. Ranti? Where to? Where to? Turn left, sir. Shouldn't we ask him to speak to make it easier? The Minister has given clear orders. Don't talk. Just use gestures. - You brought a gun? - I think everybody did. I didn't. If you don't believe that story, why bring a gun? Do you want to kill us all? Listen, we shouldn't start suspecting each other. I brought a gun just in case. 'Prediction of King Jayabaya' When the country was just 50 years old... the fight for treasure would get worse. One person would be the most reliable secret bearer of the treasure. He would be known as the sleeper. We've been looking for him for years. Why? Nothing, I just think he might be... I don't know... dangerous? Dangerous? Is that why his mouth is gagged? I don't think he's gagged because he's dangerous. Well, why then? So that he can't tell us where the treasure is hidden. Do you know who's in the car following us? The cops. Why are they bringing the cops? We'll just be used until we finish digging. How fast can this bus go? Fast enough to not be chased by that car. Hey, don't play tricks. Try to think what makes those people expect the treasure more than us. I know the Minister well. I'm like his own son. - So what? - This is betrayal. Just see who'll betray who when the cops shoot us all. I swear I won't hesitate. Bagas, never aim a gun at me. Atik, give me the walkie talkie. Now, tell us the location of the treasure. Where? It's on the Bendonowongso Hill. 7 steps before the temple. What's wrong with the bus? The story is true. Only one of us will remain alive. - Bambang, take me home. - We're already halfway there. If you want to go home, go alone by that bus or by foot. We'll take the car. Where to turn? Where? We already arrived here. One more would protect the sleeper. He was the one who knew exactly where to find the treasure. When the time came and the protector died... the duty to protect the sleeper would be continued by his descendant. All the stories turned out to be true. Now what do we do? We need a bigger car to carry all these boxes. First of all, we have to take care of this one. Don't move! - Drop your gun! - Eros, stay out of this. You stay put as well. Drop your gun! He's my subordinate. I don't know how he found us. Now, let's finish everything. Janus, one of us must die. Let it be me. Accept your destiny, Eros. We've been waiting for you for a long time. When the time came... the sleeper would tell the treasure secret to the Just King... the leader who would lead this nation to the gate of prosperity. On a hill, the three of them would meet. But the meeting was the beginning of a difficult struggle. Because since that time, evils would also have united to make them fail. Wars, diseases, disasters... would come one after another to test their struggle.
