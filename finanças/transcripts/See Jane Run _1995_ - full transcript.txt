Woman on P.A.: Manager to check stand two for check approval. Yeah, check the label. [ chatter ] Woman on P.A.: Cleanup on aisle two. Woman's voice: Wait a minute. I see somebody I know. No. [ chatter on P.A. ] Woman's voice: Do you know me? Do you know me? [ horn honks ] Okay, don't panic. Okay. My name is... My name is... Oh, my God. Oh, my God. [ dog barking ] Could this be my house, my neighborhood? [ phone rings ] - [ police radio chatter ] - Woman's voice: Someone will help me. Someone will find me. [ crying ] Honey, have a sandwich. Oh, honey. Look, look, that's your sandwich. Do I have a child? Am I married? Oh, my God. [ phone ringing ] Woman: Jesus, stop it. Daddy's checking in. Child: But I want a burger. Cheeseburger and fries. Woman: You heard what I said. Now please be quiet. When we get up to the room, I'll order you something nutritious for a change. - But a burger's better. - Jason, that's it. - You eat them and so does Dad. - Stop it or you'll have nothing to eat at all. Enjoy your stay. I'd like a room. I don't have a reservation. Uh, I had a change of plans. Man: Uh, how many in your party? No party, just me. - [ phone ringing ] - Single, then. And how many nights? Um, one-- two, I-- well, it just-- it just depends on how my day goes. I think we can handle that. - May I have your credit card? - No, I don't have it with me. I told you I had a change of plans. But that's no problem. I can pay in cash. - How much is the room? - 280 a night. It's our policy to take a credit card imprint in case there are other charges. Sir, are you telling me that the only way a person can register in this hotel is if they don'thave the money to pay for it? Or is this policy reserved just for women? I never suggested that, ma'am. I-- I know you didn't mean to suggest that. I understand your concern and this is a peculiar situation. It will be straightened out as soon as my driver arrives with my luggage and my briefcase. [ sighs ] Oh, God. [ gasps ] [ water running ] - [ knob squeaks ] - [ water shuts off ] Woman's voice: There's so much. What's this? Today. Pat Rutherford. [ siren blaring in distance ] [ sighs ] Woman's voice: Pat Rutherford. Man, woman? Come on. Come on, give me something. Give me anything. Can I help you find something? Um, everything. [ chuckles ] Woman's voice: Tailored. Looks all right, I guess. That'll be 489.63. I haven't seen that in a while. I robbed a bank. Announcer: This is the final boarding call. Announcer: Your attention, please. Southbound track-- Costa Mesa, San Juan Capistrano, and San Diego-- is ready for boarding at gate number seven. I need to, uh, talk to someone. [ phone ringing ] Hi, I'm Dr. Melloff. Sorry I kept you so long. Sit up here and let me have a look at you. You don't recall having a fall of any kind? No. Any double vision? - No. - Follow my finger. Any tiny lights when you look to the side? - No. - What's my name? - Dr. Melloff. - Good. Hold your hands out flat. Don't let me push them down. Good. Well, the EEG looks fine. The skull films don't show any fractures. Difficulty sleeping? - No. - Staying awake? No. So what do you remember? Come on, do I have to go through this again? I've already talked to the police, two interns, and a nurse. Isn't it in your report? Indulge me. I found myself at the supermarket and I didn't know what I was doing there, how I got there, or who I was. I was, um, alone and I had no identification. I didn't know what to do, so I-- I wandered around for a few hours and then I checked into a hotel. How'd you pay for the hotel? I found some money in the pocket of my trench coat. Why didn't you go to the police immediately? Well, I was confused. [ stammering ] I don't know. But you had no trouble remembering the events of the last 24 hours? - None. - Could you stand up for me? Close your eyes. Balance on your right foot. Good. What about current events? Do you know who the president is? Well, I know who he is, I just don't know if I voted for him. Well, we don't have all the blood work in, but I frankly don't think we're gonna find anything there. So you're telling me I'm fine? - I'm delighted. - You're not? No, Doctor. I really need to know that there's a reason I can't remember anything prior to yesterday. There's a reason. What's my name? Dr. Melloff! And why do you keep asking me that? I don't have any problem remembering other people's names, only my own. Do you have a short fuse? How would I know? [ chatter on P.A. ] Am I crazy? No. I think what we're looking at here is acute nonpsychotic syndrome. Well, that's very clear. In lay terms, it works like this-- everybody has a limit to the tolerance of anxiety. And when that level is reached, some people choose escape through a sudden loss of memory. It's called a fugue state. - So I'm nuts? - On the contrary. In a way, it's a healthy mechanism. When a life situation becomes too stressful, some of us deal with it by not dealing with it, by escaping. A form of self-preservation. Now, the good news is that a fugue state usually disappears within a few days, weeks, months-- as quickly as it came. I'll prescribe some tranquilizers. And the bad news? You're going to have to deal with the situation that caused the trauma. [ door opens ] Dr. Melloff, may I see you for a moment? I'll be right back. Dr. Melloff: Do you recognize this man? Well, that's Jane. That's my wife. Jane: When did you say we got married? Man: August 18th, 1982. It's right there in the marriage certificate. Where is this? That's St. Thomas, Christmas. Our first vacation. I had just finished my surgical residency. Are you at City General, too? No. I have privileges there, but I'm Chief of Pediatric Surgery at Jefferson Memorial. Where's my wedding band? Your wedding band. You went into a ladies' room of a restaurant and went to put cream in your hands or something. It slipped down the drain. [ chuckles ] You drove the manager crazy having him tear all the plumbing apart. We never found it. I promised to replace it, but I'm sorry. I forgot. Huh, you'd be amazed at the things you can forget. [ engine turns off ] No, wait. Please. [ sighs ] Okay. How did you find me at the hospital? You were on your way to San Diego to visit your brother Tom. I called to make sure you got there safely and he said you never made it. I got worried, I called the police, and they said that they'd just brought a woman in to City General that was amnesiac. She matched your description. Jane's voice: Okay, it sounds possible. Jane, you-- you-- don't push yourself trying to remember. Dr. Melloff said it's all gonna come back, - but you have to relax. - Right. I know it must be strange, you know, all of this and particularly me, but... I wanna say this and I'm not gonna say it again until you're ready to hear it. I love you. We have a great life together. We're gonna get it back. [ car door opens, closes ] Jane's voice: At least I have good taste. You okay? One brother, no sisters? And your father died when you were 11 and you were very close to your mother. - Were? - Are. - You said "were." - Let's wait on this. Is she dead? [ sighs ] She died in an accident last year. She was driving your car. Some guy ran a light. She died instantly. I'm sorry. Well, come on. Let's go in. Woman: Hi, Michael. Jane. - Who's that? - That's Carole Garson. She's a good friend. She's lived over there almost as long as we have. She's going through a rough time right now. Her husband Daniel moved out a few months ago. Left her alone with two teenagers. Her father is going senile. [ door closes ] [ scoffs ] I gather I wasn't modest. Oh, I had that done. You never liked it, but I love it. Well, here's a tough one. Do we have any children? Yes. A daughter, Amy. Seven. Jane: Where is she? Michael: She's staying with my parents. I think we ought to let her stay there for a while until, you know-- until this is over. The doctor said you shouldn't actively try to remember things. Why not? You know, I keep thinking if I-- if I look at something, [ stammering ] then I might think of something and it'll all come back. I can dress and undress myself. [ chuckles ] I'm hovering, aren't I? All right, look, I'm gonna sleep in the guest room for a couple of days until you feel a little more comfortable. Thank you. I just-- thank you. Also, I've, uh-- I've hired a woman named Paula Marinelli to help out while I'm at the office. What's that? [ chuckles ] You've always hated taking medicine, but, uh, these are my old tranquilizers that Dr. Melloff prescribed. You take one of these three times a day. I'll get some water. - Tell me about our friends. - [ water running ] You wondering if there's any more of our favorites? Jane's voice: Rutherford. Michael: Well, there's Peter and Sarah Tanner. Tanner? They're not in here. Well, check "S" for Sarah or "B" for best friend or I don't know. You have your own weird little Dewey Decimal System. Okay, here they are. Do we know anyone named Pat? No. Pat, no. Why? Why, does that name mean something? No, it's just a-- just a name. What is it? What are you thinking? Nothing. [ sighs ] Jane. Jane, listen. The only way this thing is gonna get fixed is if you take this and you totally relax. Okay. That's a girl. All right, you'll sleep. Absolutely no stress. What happened? Oh, that's the hazards of pediatrics. One of the kids in the office slammed me in the head with a metal plane. [ birds chirping ] [ sighs ] [ dog barking ] Hi. I'm Paula Marinelli. Dr. Ravenson was supposed to tell you. Oh, he did. I forgot. Is-- is he still asleep? Oh, no. He had surgery early this morning. Are you hungry? I could bring you up some breakfast. I'd rather eat in the kitchen. The doctor wants you to get as much rest as possible. Well, I think I can make it downstairs. So how did my husband come to hire you? I met him at the hospital. He operated on my little girl. What was wrong with her? Spinal aneurysm. Dr. Ravenson operated for eight hours. She would've died without him. I'm sorry. Where is she while you're working? My mother looks after her. [ scoffs ] So you can look after me? I'm happy to do it. Well, in a day or two, I should be able to manage by myself. Oh, no. I am here till everything's back to order. That's very nice of you. I could never repay Dr. Ravenson for what he did. I was on welfare when Christina needed the surgery and I couldn't pay. But he operated anyway and he offered me a job. And your husband? I was never married. - Sorry. - I'm not. Very few men are like your husband. - Mm. - Are you all done? Jane's voice: She's in love with Michael. Jane's voice: Oh, Amy, do you miss me? Come on. Medication and nap. - But I just got up. - That was hours ago. Here you go. Oh, I don't want any more pills. They make me feel like I'm underwater. Please take them. Dr. Ravenson thinks it's important. Thank you. I take it every Wednesday. It's a great class to do. Oh, I'll take the class. Okay. All right. - [ horn honks ] - Watch out. Turn on your lights, jerk! - Shh! - [ brakes screech ] Hey! Mind your own damn business! - You mind yours! - All right, come on. Let's get out of here. Come on. Come on! [ echoes ] You wanna get us killed? [ tires screeching ] [ both screaming ] [ phone ringing ] - Hello? - [ ringing continues ] Paula: Mrs. Ravenson isn't in right now. She's visiting her brother for a few weeks. All right. Thank you. - Who was that? - I don't know. Some-- someone named Sarah. Well, why did you say I was visiting my brother? Well, Dr. Ravenson said you shouldn't be disturbed by phone calls right now. Well, what if I wanna talk to that person? Wait till you get your strength back. There's nothing wrong with my strength. It's my memory. Then what's the point of talking with someone you can't remember? And then this maniac starts backing up full speed and tries to run us over. That's not a dream. It really happened. I've always had this violent temper. I was always afraid it was gonna get you into trouble. And this one night, it almost got you and Sarah killed. But I only told the guy his lights were off. - He went berserk. - Well, a lot of nuts out there, but this is a good sign. It means that pieces of your memory are coming back. But, Michael, these pills. I feel so rotten. I feel like I'm underwater. My mouth is dry, I have bad dreams. Say no more. [ touch tones beeping ] [ line ringing ] - Hello? - Yeah, hi, Dr. Melloff. I'm sorry to bother you so late. This is Michael Ravenson. - Yes, Michael. How can I help? - Uh, listen, Jane's having a problem with the medication. She's not so comfortable. What do you think's going on? - Is she sleeping? - Yeah, well, that's all she's doing. Dr. Melloff: It's not the medication. I think it's her system. Michael, she has to understand it's going to take time. The important thing is not to let her get upset. Michael: And that's it? I think so for now. All right, thank you. Okay, just call if you have any further problems. Will do. Night. [ sighs ] - [ muffled music playing ] - [ doorbell rings ] - Hi. - Hi. Um, this is a little clumsy. Um, Michael told me we were friends and I needed to talk to someone. - I escaped. - From what? - Paula, - Oh. the woman Michael hired to babysit me. Uh-huh. You take, uh, cream, no sugar, right? Huh, I don't know. You really can't remember anything? Well, neither can I, but I can't blame mine on trauma. I think you take cream. - Hey. - Oh, hi, Mrs. Ravenson. - Hi. - Hey, I'm out of here. Hold it, hold it. Aren't you supposed to take your grandpa for a walk first? - Mom, I'm late. - You're late. - Yeah! Celine will do it. - Carole: Oh, yeah, sure, Celine will do it. Do you see Celine anywhere? Oh! This is my job. My job is I'm supposed to take care of everything because nobody else can do anything. Do you see Celine? I don't see Celine. - No, look, if this isn't a good time, I can-- - Oh, please, Jane, - there's no good time. - I'm sorry. - I'm-- I'm really sorry. - Are you? Do you remember Daniel? My soon-to-be ex-husband Daniel? [ clock ticking ] [ scoffs ] Wow, that's amazing. You used to go running with him every morning. Oh, Michael told me. You're a very lucky woman, Jane. You're married to the perfect man. - That seems so... - [ chuckles ] In fact, you don't even know how perfect, do you? [ chuckles ] - [ doorbell rings ] - What's that supposed to mean? Excuse me, I have to get the door. Probably not as chaotic over at your house. - [ knocking, doorbell ringing ] - Okay, I'm coming! - [ door opens ] - Carole: Oh, hi. - Paula: Is Jane here? - Uh, yes, actually, she is. - [ door closes ] - [ sighs ] - I think this must be your keeper. - Where have you been? You don't even tell me you're leaving the house. I go to give you your medication, you're not there. I didn't think I needed to ask permission-- Dr. Ravenson trusts me to take care of you. Didn't you think I'd be frightened? I've been up and down the street. - Been looking for you everywhere! - Okay, okay, okay. Paula, I'm sorry. Thanks for the coffee. Yeah, sure. [ door opens ] [ door closes ] - [ dog barking ] - [ birds chirping ] Amy's voice: Mommy, hurry! Come and get me! - Amy, Amy, just calm down, sweetheart. - Mommy, where are you? Just calm down and tell Mommy exactly where you are, okay? - I can't, Mommy! Help me, Mommy! - Just calm down. Shh. - Help me! - Mommy will be there. - Please help, Mommy! - Don't worry, honey. Mommy will be there. - Mommy loves you. Calm down. - Help me! Please help me! Amy? Amy?! [ echoes ] You just missed her. Check the playground. Amy! Amy? - [ horn honks ] - [ tires screech ] Come on, the gas pedal, you idiot! - The long, skinny one on the right! - [ horn honks ] - Don't get out of your car! - [ car door closes ] Temper, temper. You don't wanna get involved in an accident. - Stop! - Mommy! No! [ gasps ] [ pants ] Oh. Amy. It's Mommy. - It's Mommy. - [ screams ] Mommy! Mommy! - [ cries ] - It's all right. There's nothing to be afraid of. Mommy told you not to go upstairs. I'm sorry if she disturbed you. My mother had to go to the doctor, so I brought her to work. No, I thought-- I was dreaming. I'm sorry, honey. I didn't mean to scare you. I thought you were my little girl. - [ whimpers ] - It's okay. Oh. [ pants ] Dr. Melloff. Where-- where is it? Oh. [ touch tones beeping ] Woman: Operator 119. This is Sandy. Yes, could I have the number for a Dr. Melloff? Yes. Do you know the city? No, I'm sorry, I don't. No, in Los Angeles. Los Angeles? And that's Dr. Melcroft? - Melloff. - Yes, Melcroft. No, Melloff. Hold for the number, please. The number is 555 - 4675. - Please, slow down. - Repeat. - Slow down. - 555... - Slow down. I can't. - I can't. - 4675. - Please make a note of it. - Jane: Four... ...six... Sweetheart, who are you calling? Who are you calling? Dr. Melloff. Why are you calling Dr. Melloff? I need to know what he prescribed for me. Well, I told you Ativan. No, my heart is racing. Something's wrong. Oh, darling, it's your body telling you that you need some rest. Now, come here. Don't fight it. Where's my address book? - I don't know. - It was in here. - It was in here. Look. - [ sighs ] I don't need to look. If you tell me it's not there, it's not there. No, Paula-- Paula hid it. Well, then we'll talk to Paula. But, sweetheart, why do you need your address book? 'Cause maybe I need to call my friends. Maybe I-- maybe I hate being cooped up here all day with Paula watching. She takes me to the bathroom. She doesn't let me answer the phone. She tells my friends I'm not home. - She watches and watches. - Darling, that's my fault. I told Paula not to let you take calls. I didn't want you to be embarrassed in front of your friends. Now, that's my fault and I'm-- I'm very sorry. Something's wrong, Michael. I'm not getting better. Maybe I need to see a doctor, a psychiatrist. - I can't-- I can't remember. - All right, sweetheart. I'll make an appointment. Come on. Let's get up in the bed. It's okay. [ sighs ] I'll do anything. If you don't like Paula, I'll get rid of her. If you wanna see your friends, we'll invite them over. Anything. [ sighs ] Or is it me? Am I the problem? No. I am. No. I love you. [ sighs ] And I don't know why this is happening to us. But I'll do whatever I can to make this thing go away. Oh, Michael. Oh, Michael. Buddies, please. I wanna see everybody... Is that better? Feel better? Okay, good. Excuse me. Sarah: Excuse me, sir. Careful! - [ grunts ] - Hey, help! Stop, stop! Stop! - What are you, dead from the neck up? - [ grunts ] That was a child, you freak! - What are you...? - [ grunting ] [ both grunting ] - Mommy! Mommy, no! - That was a child! A child! A child! Man: Are you crazy? Get off! - That was a child. - Jane! No, Jane. Why do you do these things? Someday, some maniac is gonna kill you. Paula: Jane? Jane, wake up. Jane, it's okay. Jane. Jane, wake up. Jane, wake up. It's okay. Come on. It's okay. It's time for medication. - [ sighs ] - We're going for a drive today. Come on. In the hospital, I was fine. I was clear. - No more pills. - Come on, Jane. Take your medication. Come on. Come on. It's okay. - [ phone rings ] - I gotta get the phone. Paula: Hello? Mom. Okay, just calm down. Stop, stop. Mom. There is nothing I can do about it right now. She'll be all right. Just give her a big hug and then she'll stop crying. Yes, she will. Mom, I'll talk to you in a little bit. Okay, I gotta go. My mother calls me all the time. I cannot be two places at once. You know, lots of kids have nightmares. Plenty of parents work. It's like this is all my fault. She's driving me crazy. Well, I'm feeling much better. Maybe we won't need you as much as we have. - Oh, no. That's not what I meant. - Stop. - Stop, stop, stop! - What? [ tires screech ] [ engine turns off ] [ car door opens ] [ door closes ] [ gasps ] That's Amy's school. Jane? - [ kids chattering ] - [ school bell rings ] That's Amy's school. I remember. I wanna tell Michael. I wanna tell Michael. I-- I wanna tell Michael. [ phone ringing ] Mommy, I don't wanna go in the doctor's office. Honey, the doctor's only gonna look at you. No shots. I promise. Ever since the surgery, she's terrified of doctors. Hey. You see this pretty little doll? - Mm-hmm. - She'd like to play with you. She's saying, "Hello. Please play with me. Please play with me." Oh. [ door opens ] Jane. Dr. Ravenson, I'm so sorry. No, it's all right. Come on in. There it was, Amy's school. It just came to me. Well, see, that's the way Dr. Melloff said it would happen. - I'm very happy. - Oh, so am I. So am I. I wanna bring Amy home. I keep dreaming about her. She must be so confused. Uh, darling, you've had a single dramatic breakthrough. You remembered her school. It's not enough. - But she needs me. - Yeah, I think it would be very upsetting to her. But I feel so much better since I didn't take the pills. Now, why didn't Paula give them to you? I hid them in my shoe. Michael, they were making me feel so lousy. The other morning, I-- I woke up, I was drooling on my pillow. I felt like I'd had a stroke. All right, I got the point. I'll call Dr. Melloff again. - I'll see what he has to say. - And then we can talk about Amy? Yeah. I've got two more patients, then I'm home. [ dog barking ] Hey! Hey, Jane. - How you doing? - Hi. You lost some weight. You okay? Um, I'm fine. I'm just getting over a virus. Still running every morning? No, not lately. - Oh, are you here to see Carole? - [ chuckles ] I'm, uh, taking Andrew to camp. Hey, bud. It's not gonna fit in the trunk. - Why don't you just lay it in the backseat? - Okay. Is that your new philosophy, Daniel? Laying them in the backseat? You know, we could do without the sarcasm for a few minutes. Look, I'm gonna go inside now. Oh, don't let a little spousal tension scare you away, Jane. No, it's just that I'm feeling a little weak. - I better go. - Oh, yes. Yes, I know. Call me if you need anything, okay? Oh, I'm sure she will. Jane's very needy these days, aren't you, dear? [ car door closes ] - Carole? - [ car engine starts ] What was that about? [ scoffs ] Go home, Jane, before I say something I really regret. - Like what? - Like telling you what I think of you. [ sighs ] You were my friend, for God's sake, and you made a complete fool out of me. H-how? What did I do? Oh, just cut the innocent crap, will you? I know all about your affair with my husband and so does Michael. - Let's go inside. - No. Jane. No, no! You know what? I'm gonna make you a nice bath. I'm gonna make you a cup of tea. - You can sit up in the sunroom. - No, I'm leaving. - Hey, it's okay. - No. - Sit in the sunroom. - No, get away from me! Okay. Jane's voice: So that's what this is about. This is who you are. You cheat on your-- on your husband. You cheat-- cheat on your best friend. Pat Rutherford. Oh, my God, Pat Rutherford. Room 20. A motel? Was it a motel? Oh, God, Michael. I'm sorry. What are these doing here? Someone hid them from me. Why? Why? My purse. - Oh, no. - Jane. - It's all right. - No. No, I'm leaving. Oh, sweetheart, you're hysterical. Paula! - Let me go! - You're hysterical. Nobody's telling me the truth! It's all right. Give me your arm. - Give me your arm. - No. Hold still. That's right. You'll be fine. You'll be fine. It's okay. Michael: Well, uh, you didn't make her feel bad, did you? Paula: Oh, no, no. [ laughs ] - Oh, stop. - No, I just didn't know that would happen. - That's not true. - Oh, she said I-- But, I mean, was she aware that you were watching? Yes, she was aware. - She-- she knew you were... - She knew I was absolutely watching. [ both laughing ] Jane's voice: Perfect for you, Michael, isn't it? Get rid of Jane. Jane: Hello? Um, who is this? Woman: Who is this? You called me. Uh, this is Jane. Um, is Tom there? Jane, it's Ellie. You sound so peculiar. Well, I-- I just got over the flu. Um, I need to talk to Tom. You know Tom doesn't get home till after 10:00. Right. Oh, right, right. Um, Ellie, did Michael call and ask if I was there? Why would he ask if you were here? Ellie, please, you gotta listen. Something-- something's happened to me [ stammering ] and I can't remember who I am and it's very hard for me to focus. [ dog barks ] Jane, is Michael there? - Can I speak to him? - No, no, you just have to listen. You have to listen. Now-- now, Michael told the police that, um-- that, um, I went to visit my brother in San Diego. But then I found my purse. How could I have gone to San Diego if I didn't have my purse with all my ID? You've gotta tell Tom to come and get me. You've gotta tell him to come and get me right now. [ line clicks ] Ellie, it's Michael. Michael, what's going on? I'm sorry to get you involved. I didn't wanna worry you and Tom. Jane's having some kind of breakdown. I think it's related to the accident. She's under doctor's care and we're doing the best we can. Don't wanna worry you and they say she's gonna be fine, so, okay, don't worry. Give my best to Tom, please. I'll talk to you later. Excuse me. Can I help you? Um, yes. Can you tell me what these are? Where'd you get these? They're Ativan, right? Who told you they were Ativan? Well, what are they, then? It's Haldol. Something you don't wanna mess with. Listen, you haven't been taking these, have you, without a prescription? Well, I had trouble sleeping and a friend gave them to me. First, get rid of the pills, then you get rid of the friend. Otherwise, it can cause you severe, irreversible symptoms-- uncontrollable movements like Parkinson's disease. Haldol is a drug of last resort for psychosis. Jane? - What is it? - Don't you touch me. Just stay away. What are you trying to do to me? Dr. Melloff prescribed Ativan. You've been giving me Haldol. Haldol? You tell me this is Ativan? Jane, where did you get this? Huh? Did you get these from my bag? Oh, now you're saying that you didn't give that to me? Of course I didn't give these to you. What, you think I'm crazy? - No, I think you're lying! - Jane, why would I lie to you? What happened between us, Michael, that you don't want me to remember? What happened? Jane, I don't think you should push this - until you're feeling better. - No, no, no. I'm not gonna wait until my brain is fried and I can't think anymore! Michael, when I was wandering the streets that day, I-- I found hundred-dollar bills in my pockets and my dress was covered with blood. Does that ring a bell? What about the blood, Michael? Where did the blood come from? All right, look. A year ago... [ sighs ] ...when your mother was killed, you went into a severe depression and the doctors called it survivor's guilt. They prescribed Haldol. It worked. For a while, everything seemed okay. You-- yeah, you even started running with Daniel next door a few days a week. And then it was every day. And then, well, running wasn't enough. So I had an affair? What about the money? [ sighs ] It was from our joint account. The bank called me and said that you'd withdrawn $10,000, closed the account. I assumed that you were running off with one of your lovers. I came running home. You were hysterical. You were packing. Said you were leaving me. Said that I didn't deserve to live with someone like you. I argued, I said no. We fought, you hit me. And there was blood everywhere. You said survivor's guilt. Was I in the car with my mother? You were driving. You were in a hurry. You, uh, missed a turn. Witnesses said that you didn't signal and some car slammed into the passenger side. - What else? - No. No, no, you have to tell me the truth. - You have to tell me everything. - Nothing. Please. Amy. [ sighs ] Amy was in the backseat behind your mother. She died in your arms waiting for the ambulance. [ whimpers ] [ crying ] Oh, no, I didn't-- I didn't do that. I didn't do that. - [ stammering ] - I'm sorry. [ sobs ] Sarah: Hi, sweetie. Hi. Hi, it's Sarah. And-- and Peter's here. We came to see you. Honey, oh-- oh, my God. [ cries ] It's okay. She's not in any pain. Can she hear me or...? Jane? It's Sarah and Peter. - Can you say hello? - Jane's voice: Sarah? Jane? Peter? Hello. I-- Michael, I don't understand this. I don't understand this. I mean, I know she suffered a major trauma, but this is Jane, for God's sake. - Shh. - She's always been in control. She's always been-- Janey? Jane, you've gotta break out of this. Please. She's not getting better. She can barely open her eyes. Michael, maybe you shouldn't be caring for her at home. Why not? I just think she might get better care at a hospital or, you know, a facility. Peter, I'm not putting Jane anywhere. She belongs here at home where she's, you know-- she's surrounded by love. She's been home, Michael, and she's going downhill. Tracy, you remember, my friend who thought she was pregnant? Turns out it was early menopause. Is that disgusting? Men can start a family at 80, but women are washed up at 40. You heard me, didn't you? I knew you were in there. Please, Janey, come out. It's so great out here even with early menopause. But-- but, listen, Peter's trying to talk Michael into institutionalizing you. - So, please, - Jane's voice: Go away. - you've got to fight. - Jane's voice: Just go away. I killed my baby. [ phone ringing ] I'm gonna put this money back into our account. So you just sit there. This will take a minute. Then we'll go home. [ gasps ] Woman: Jane? Jane Ravenson? You're Amy's mother. Anne. Anne Halloran-Gimblet. - Our daughters are in class together. - Anne Halloran-Gimblet. I was on that field trip where you slugged that man and I always wanted to call you and say how terrific that was. I mean, all of us mothers, we were just standing around while that pig pushed our kids and nobody did anything but you. - My dream. - Anyway, I, uh-- I'm glad I got a chance to tell you now that I thought you were wonderful. And I will never let six months go by before I get in touch. Michael: Dr. Gurney's the best in his field. He's got a private psychiatric hospital a couple hours from here. I've made an appointment for us to see him tomorrow after I get out of surgery. Paula's gonna pack some of your things in case-- in case he wants you to stay for a couple of days. Jane's voice: Six months go by. Six months go by. [ stammering ] Excuse me, ma'am. I have a return. I'm sorry, we don't accept returns with bloodstains. [ echoes ] Besides, you bought this six months ago. [ echoes ] Amy? Amy? Amy? Amy?! [ church bell ringing ] Amy! Amy! Come to Mommy, honey. Come to Mommy, Amy. Amy! Mommy's here. Mommy's here. Mommy's here. Mommy's here, Amy. [ stammering ] Amy! Amy, no! No! [ gasps ] - [ panting ] No. - It's okay. - No. No. - Jane, shh. - [ cries ] - Jane, shh. It's a dream, Jane. Shh, shh. Jane's voice: Oh, Amy. Michael: You wanna tell me about your dream? Hmm? You wanna tell me? Hmm? Here. Take these. I gotta get up in the morning. I gotta operate. I've got a long drive to the hospital. It's all right, take it. That's a girl. Jane's voice: She couldn't go on a field trip six months ago. She died last year. She couldn't go. She couldn't go on that field trip. Jane: Telephone and address for an Anne Halloran-Gimblet. - Operator: Is that Gimlet? - Gimblet. - In Brentwood. - Okay, the address is 1243 San Vicente Avenue. And that's in Brentwood. [ door closes ] Hi. Feeling better? The doctor said you had a rough night. Yes, I did. Paula, could you get me a straight chair? - My back is killing me. - Sure. [ clattering ] Where do you want it? Oh, uh, over there is fine. Morning dosage. No, you don't, Jane. Swallow them. Good. I'm gonna be sick. Okay, okay. - I want the bathroom. - Okay. - I'll be sick. - All right. - [ Jane grunts ] - [ glass shatters ] Paula: What the hell are you doing? Oh! - [ pounding on door ] - Let me out of here, Jane! - Get back here! - [ doorknob rattles ] - Open the door! - [ pounding ] [ retches, coughs ] [ coughs ] [ doorbell rings ] Please be home, please be home. Please. Coming! - Hi. - Hi. - Come on in. - [ exhales ] I know I should've called first, but I just wanted to apologize for being so out of it the other day. - You were so nice. - Oh, you don't have to apologize. Don't be silly. Been on any more field trips? Uh, we had a tour of the fire department, but everyone there was disgustingly well-behaved. - [ chuckles ] - We missed you. - Oh. - Jane, I am so sorry, but I have an appointment. Oh, no, no, I-- I should've-- - I should've called you first. - Oh, no problem! Don't you love this new picture? I wish they could have Mrs. Rutherford every year. Pat. Rutherford? - Yes, their teacher. - This year. Anne: Oh, I love to watch them change from year to year. - Second grade just blew right by. - Jane's voice: There she is. Oh, Amy, you're alive. You're alive. Carole: No, no, no, no! No, what are you doing?! I need you to believe me. I'm right about this. I'm right about this, Carole. - Jane. Jane, I am not gonna talk to him. - [ touch tones beeping ] You don't have to. I will. Just get on that phone and listen. - No! - Do it! [ line rings ] - Hello? - Hello, Daniel. - Yeah. - This is Jane, Jane Ravenson. Jane. I'm sorry. I didn't even recognize your voice. - How you feeling? - Better. Thanks. Daniel, I need to ask you something and it's gonna sound peculiar. But I need you to answer me... ...honestly. - Did we ever have an affair? - [ chuckles ] What? Jane: I'm serious. Did we ever have an affair? Oh, God, not again. - Has Carole been telling you-- - No, it's just me asking. Yes or no? No. Of course we didn't. Thank you. Do you mind telling me what's going on? I will, I will. Later. Later. Thank you, Daniel. Thank you. He didn't know you were on. He'd have no reason to lie. Was it Michael that told you about the affair? Yeah. Who was driving the car when my mother was killed? Your mother. Michael told me that I was driving. That I killed my mother and Amy. - What? - He told me that Amy died in my arms. Oh, Jane, come on. Amy's alive, isn't she? Of course she is! Listen to yourself. Where is he keeping her? Um, uh, she's at his parents' house. He's hiding her from me, Carole. No, look, look, look, he's lied to everyone. - [ exhales ] - He told-- he told you that Daniel and I were having an affair. He told me that I killed my own child. And then he kept me so drugged, I couldn't put two thoughts together. Even my own friends began to believe that I should be committed. You believe me, don't you? [ stammering ] I don't know what to believe. Why would Michael be doing these things? Why? Because I know something! - What? - I don't know. But I must've seen something or something happened that-- that he doesn't want me to remember. Please. You've gotta help me get to Amy. - Look, Jane-- - Jane. Jane, you are driving me crazy. - Get up right now! - Let go of me! I don't wanna hear what you have to say! [ thuds ] Amy, you've hardly touched your food. - Here you go. - But it's too much cholesterol. Besides, I'm not hungry. Honey, who taught you that word? Did Daddy teach you that word? So what's your day like today? Well, I have an appointment with Amy's teacher at 12:30. Michael: Mm, problems? No, just an end-of-the-year conference. Amy, you're gonna miss the bus. Okay, sweetheart. Your teacher is gonna tell me such wonderful things about you today. Let's celebrate by baking a cake, okay? - Okay. - Okay, give me a kiss. Have a good day. Here's your lunch. - Teacher: Two times one is? - Kids: Two! - Two times two is? - Four! - Two times three is? - Six! - Two times four is? - Eight! - Two times five is? - 10! Two times six is? Her classwork is excellent. - Is her homework okay? - It's fine. Well, something's not fine, Mrs. Rutherford. I can hear it. This is very difficult. I think Amy's being sexually abused. W-why-- why would you think that? Amy's recent behavior. Has Amy said anything? - No. - Then where are you getting this from? Mrs. Rutherford, this is a-- - this is a hell of a leap to make. - I know. And I know this is very upsetting. But the biggest problem we have in these situations - is the parent's unwillingness to hear it. - Wait a minute, wait a minute, I am willing to listen to anything that makes sense. Amy's recent behavior is consistent with a child who's being abused. What behavior? Last week at recess, she wandered into the kindergarten room and began playing with some of the dolls. Because I was concerned about her, I wanted to observe the way she played. She was touching the dolls on the chest and between the legs and rubbing them together, whispering things I couldn't hear. Oh, please. [ scoffs ] Believe me, Mrs. Ravenson, I'm not saying these things lightly. Another day last week, I walked into class and Amy was in the back of the room with another little girl. She had one hand on her shoulder and she was whispering. For goodness' sakes, whispering? Kids... It's not what she was doing or saying. It's the way she was saying it. The way an adult would speak-- seductive, explicit. Unfortunately, I've had a lot of experience with this and Amy's behavior was dead-on. I have to talk to Amy. [ birds chirping ] Hi, Mommy. Hi, doll face. That's not my desk. You're at the wrong desk. My desk's right here. - Oh? - Mm-hmm. Well, I'm gonna have to lose a little weight if I'm gonna sit in these chairs. Honey, Mommy's here because I need to ask you a few questions, okay? Sit up here. Remember when Susan took that money out of her mommy's purse and you were afraid to tell me? And we talked and I told you that there was nothing in the world that you ever, ever had to be afraid of telling me? - You remember that? - Mm-hmm. Okay, well, this is one of those times. Don't be afraid of telling me the truth, sweetheart. I won't get mad at you no matter what. I promise. And you know that Mommy always keeps her promises, right? Okay. Okay. Amy, when Celine babysits for you, does she ever have any of her boyfriends over? No, she's never had any boys over when Mommy and Daddy are out of the house? No, she always plays with me. [ chuckles ] Well, what about Andrew when he sits? Does he ever have any girls over? Does he ever say anything to you that makes you feel uncomfortable? Like what? Well, like asking you to play a game that you don't wanna play. Or does he ever touch you in a way that you feel uncomfortable? Does Andrew ever touch you in a way that you don't like? Honey, you need to tell Mommy the truth. If anything happened, Mommy knows it's not your fault. Does Andrew ever touch you where it's private? Not Andrew. Who, honey? Tell Mommy who touched you. [ whispers ] Daddy. Jane. Jane, what's going on? You miserable bastard. What's the matter? I went to see Amy's teacher today. So? So she thinks Amy's been sexually abused. What? That's impossible. Well, that's what I thought. And then I talked to Amy. How could you? You're her father. You lousy son of a bitch! Me? Jane, you're upset. Don't play games with me, Michael! Excuse me, but will you listen to what you're saying? You really believe I'm capable of, what, - molesting my own daughter? - I believe her. Well, how can you be so sure? She's a child, she's got an imagination, - she watches television. - She's telling the truth. [ scoffs ] What? So, what, kids never lie? Kids never make things up? I believe her, Michael. Well, so how can you be so sure?! Because she loves you! Because it broke her heart to tell me and because I know when my daughter's telling the truth. Well, sure, 'cause you know everything. Right? Jane knows it all! Slug a guy in the library, - it's the guy's fault. - Oh, come on, Michael, that has nothing to do-- Jane, who the hell are you? Huh? I've been married to you for 12 years. I don't know anymore! You know something? If somebody molested my daughter, - I'm gonna kill him! - Oh, Michael. It's always somebody else, isn't it? Amy's lying, Jane's crazy. Well, this is it. It's over. - [ clinking ] - You're never gonna touch your daughter again. What the hell are you-- what the hell are you gonna do, huh? The hell you think you're doing? What, you got medical proof, huh? You're gonna drag our daughter through court? You're gonna fight for custody? Oh, you're damn right I'm gonna fight for custody! Well, you're not gonna get it 'cause you're unfit! - And I can prove it! - [ screams ] [ grunts ] [ gasps ] [ Jane gasps ] Jane: And then I found myself wandering. That was it. I'd forgotten everything. Oh, please not Michael. Jane, I really think we need to get home. Of course you don't believe any of this, do you? Give me your keys. [ birds chirping ] [ siren blaring ] Oh, no, not now. I can't pull over. Oh, no. [ gasps ] [ sighs ] [ touch tones beeping ] [ phone ringing ] [ line rings ] [ ringing continues ] - [ line ringing ] - [ sighs ] [ car door closes ] There we go, lady. We'll put the groceries in the kitchen. You run along and wash up for lunch, honey. I found out that the pony rides start at 3:00. So she can have a nice lunch and then we'll surprise her. Oh, she's gonna like that. Do you think so? Honey, don't worry so. She's gonna be all right. [ whispers ] Where were you, Mommy? You said to wait for you and I waited and waited and you never came. I know, sweetheart, but Mommy got very sick and couldn't come back. But that's all over now and we're gonna go away together just like we planned, just the two of us. Grandmother: Amy, honey? Amy, I-- I'm taking Amy back to town. You're not going anywhere with her. Honey, you're frightening the baby. Jane, let's talk about this sensibly. There's nothing to say. Come on, honey. Amy, come to Grandma, darling. Don't get involved, Doris. This is between your son and me. Amy, I want you to go outside and stand on the front porch and wait for me. I have to talk to Grandma and Grandpa. I'll be right out, okay? Grandmother: Amy. Don't you wanna give Grandma and Grandpa a goodbye kiss? I don't think that would be such a good idea, Amy. Why don't you just throw them a kiss? Grandmother: So Michael's not enough, huh? You're gonna tell her a lot of lies about us, too. I don't have a problem with you and Bert, Doris. You love Amy. I know that. The problem is with Michael. - He's been telling you lies. - Michael doesn't lie, Jane. We're not gonna let you hurt Michael like this, Jane. Do you realize what you're doing? You're gonna lose everything. Michael's going to keep Amy and his practice. Never. Jane: "Rikki-Tikki had a right to be proud of himself. But he did not grow too proud and he kept that garden as a mongoose should keep it with tooth and jump and spring and bite till never a cobra dared show its head inside the walls." [ horn honks in distance ] Sarah: Now will you tell me what's been going on? Well, when we left the cottage, I was afraid of Michael, so we drove straight to the D.A.'s office. He listened politely, but then said he needed more evidence. A seven-year-old child, it's her word against his. So I hired a lawyer and she's been tracking down Michael's patients. And we hit pay dirt with a Mrs. Klinger. - She's on her way over. - [ exhales ] [ knocks ] Oh, I'm so glad you're here. - Please come in. - I can't stay long. Mu husband is waiting in the car. - He's not coming up? - I can only stay a minute. Oh, please don't say what I think you're gonna say. I'm sorry, Mrs. Ravenson. I know you were counting on us and I hate to disappoint you-- Then don't, please. Mrs. Klinger: My husband and I argued all last night about it. He's adamant. He won't let Lisa testify. My husband molested your child. We have no proof. Do you believe her? Yes, I do. But who else is gonna believe a five-year-old? My daughter is also going to testify and my attorney is going through Dr. Ravenson's files - to see if there's any other children-- - Lisa has been through so much. Since she was two, she's been through six major operations. We just can't subject her to any more. Please understand. I do. - I'm so sorry. - Me, too. - I'm going to lose my daughter. - Sarah: No. We won't let it happen, Jane. Oh, right, how are you gonna stop it? What are you gonna say under oath about my marriage? That Michael was a-- a loving, considerate, wonderful husband. That-- that he was devoted to me and my child. That I must've told you a million times how lucky I was to have him. Carole will testify Michael lied to her. Oh, did he? Did he? Or was he just repeating the things his crazy wife told him? Sarah, he's got all the bases covered. I was the one who lost her memory. I was the one who tried to kill him. I was the one who locked Paula in the bathroom and broke into his parents' house. I don't think they won't be only too happy to testify. Even my own doctors will say I was suffering from hysterical amnesia. He was feeding you drugs. No, no, no, I stole them out of his bag. He only injected me when I was violent. And Paula saw everything. [ sighs ] You still don't get Michael, do you? He'll do anything to get what he wants. And he could win this. It's time for Amy and me to disappear. Do you wanna lose all chances of custody? Michael will find you. He won't find us. So you're gonna spend your life running, looking over your shoulder? - What kind of life is that for Amy? - What kind of a life is it if Michael gets custody? I can't trust the legal system. Michael has all the cards. I'll go to that meeting at his lawyer's office tomorrow to show good faith. But if we can't come to an agreement, we're out of here. [ phone rings ] - Yes? - Jane? This is Paula Marinelli. How'd you get this number? Dr. Ravenson. I need to talk to you. No, we have nothing to talk about. No, wait, Jane. Please, you don't-- [ dial tone ] Michael. No, he's not that obvious. He sends Paula to do his dirty work. [ phone ringing ] [ horn honks ] Listen, since my wife's attorney has been delayed, I'd like to talk to her in private. I don't think that's unreasonable. Mrs. Ravenson? I certainly don't want to appear unreasonable. I'll be right outside the door in case you need me. I'm only dangerous when the moon is full. It's just Jane's humor. [ phone rings ] [ sighs ] I thought we could talk to each other like two adults. That's interesting for a man who prefers children. You're not making this easy. Well, I forgot to take my Haldol this morning. Jane, I know what you think I've done, but-- Save the lies for the courtroom, Michael. I want you back. I love you. I know you don't believe that. You think I'm some kind of a monster, but I love you. I want this nightmare to be over. I want you and Amy to come back home where you belong. You want. You want this, you want that. Here, open it. No. Jane, I miss you. I miss our daughter. The daughter you told me was dead? I never told you that. You were hysterical. You were irrational, delusional. - How can you be sure what anyone told you? - Oh, right, crazy Jane. No, but I know what you think I did to you. I know what you think I did to our daughter. But I never did anything. You have to believe me. - I just-- - Don't you dare touch me! What, is that a threat? Why the performance, Michael? Is the room bugged? [ sighs ] No, but, Jane, you see, that's the attitude that got us into this mess. Rigid. No room in your life for compromise. Never was. Jane's always right. She calls the shots-- who we see, what we do, when we make love, - how we make love. - Oh, so now it's my fault you molested our daughter? I never molested her. Never. Do you hear me? [ chuckles ] I was shaving, she walked into the bathroom, she was curious the way any normal child would be. [ thuds ] Don't you dare blame Amy for this. Jane, no one's to blame. Nothing happened. She told me exactly what you did. And I wanna see you dead. Excuse me, um, is everything all right in here? Arnold, yes. Come in. I'm sorry. We're not getting anywhere. She won't listen. I'm sorry I'm late. I was detained at the D.A.'s office. All right. Let's get to it. We're open to any reasonable suggestion. Well, we're not looking for any protracted court battle either. As a concerned parent, Dr. Ravenson has no desire to see his daughter separated from her mother at such a critical point in her development. We're prepared to give Mrs. Ravenson full custody of Amy. And in return? Mrs. Ravenson will drop all charges of sexual abuse. What about visitation? Well, naturally, Dr. Ravenson should see his daughter on alternate weekends, one month in the summer, and alternate Easter and Christmas vacations. Unsupervised? - Of course. - We're out of here. - Jane. - Michael: You better accept it, Jane. If you don't, I'm gonna fight for sole custody. By the time we're done with you, you'll never see her again. What, you really think the D.A. is gonna take your word over mine? You really think that a judge is gonna award custody to a woman with a history like yours? Amnesia, violence. You're so blinded by your hatred of me that you can't see the harm that you're doing to Amy, forcing her to testify against her own father! The harm I'mdoing to Amy? - Don't lose your-- - No, wait a minute, wait a minute. Let me get this straight. You get to avoid all the publicity and fallout of an incest trial, you get to keep your position at the hospital and your dazzling reputation, while on alternate weekends you get to molest our little girl? [ huffs ] I don't have to listen to this. Maybe we should schedule this for another time. There is no time. The D.A. is preparing to bring criminal charges against Dr. Ravenson. [ both scoffing ] What charges? Renee, nothing is gonna stick. It's her word against his. Not anymore. Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God? Yes. And the drugs you were giving her? They were prescribed. By whom, Dr. Ravenson? - Objection. - Withdrawn. Why did you give Mrs. Ravenson the medication? Because I believed him. I did everything he asked me to do. I kept his wife drugged. I kept her cut off from family and friends. I watched her suffer. I just believed that he was doing it for her own good. And you no longer believe that? No. He lied to me. He molested my little girl. Okay. You said Christina was having nightmares. Is that when you suspected? No. All that time I never put it together... ...till I called one day to schedule a checkup with Dr. Ravenson and she got hysterical. And that's when she told me what he did to her on his rounds at night in the hospital. [ Paula sobs ] He hurt her. Renee: And did you take Christina to another doctor to verify what she told you? [ sobs ] Yes, I did. Your Honor, we'd like to enter as exhibit six the report of Dr. Havlin, Chief of Pediatrics at Community Children's. [ chatter ] Thanks, Paula. I need to thank you. I might never have listened to my own child. [ laughs ] - Mommy! - [ chuckles ] Oh, sweetheart. Ooh! - Oh, sweetheart! - [ door opens ] - [ door closes ] - Jane. Oh, honey. Let's go home, okay? - Okay. - Ready? [ music playing ] [ music playing ]
