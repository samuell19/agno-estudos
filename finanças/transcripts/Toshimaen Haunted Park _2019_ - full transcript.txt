Hey, all! I'm Yucchi. I'm here to check out some urban legends again. My partner in crime is Cham. Hi! Good morning-afternoon-evening! I'm Cham! —That's my Cham.e have... His girlfriend Aiko is with us. —Don't cut me off.Aiko! Nice to meet you. She's a real scaredy-cat. Don't make fun of me! What was that? Don't do that, Cham! Come on, guys. Today we're at an amusement park in Tokyo. There's a rumour about this place. What is it? Don't knock on the door of the old mansion. Knock knock. Don't respond in the haunted house. —OK.on't look into the secret mirror. If you break any of these rules you'll be taken away to a secret place. Man, don't you think that's scary? Yeah, it is. Let's go home. However, there's one way to get out from there. —Which is? —That's to... Don't scare me! Come on, tell us. That's to ride on the merry-go-round. The merry-go-round in this park is the oldest in Japan. —The oldest?hat sounds scary. Look, I've become old. Stop fooling around. Go away. Well now, let's go investigate. This is the star of rule number one. The door of the old mansion. I'm getting scared. It sure is spooky. Let's not do this. Knocking on this door will take you to a secret place. Without further ado... Already? —Are you sure?ing to do it. You don't have to. Excuse me. Here I go. "Knock and you're doomed" "You really did it!" Did anything happen? "The place's cursed" "What are you doing?" —What was that? scared me. Don't scream. —It's just a bird.bird? —Just a bird.ant to go home. That freaked me out. As you can see, nothing unusual happened. There's two more. Let's move on. —We're not done? —Of course not. Let's go. Let's go home. Next up is the haunted house. Let's see what's going to happen. Keep watching! Come on, Cham. "They are hamming it up" What's wrong? Hey, don't you hear something? What? What do you hear? "Cut it out, Cham" Cham? Stop that, Cham. Don't try to scare us. Cham! What are you doing? Hey, Cham. Come on, say something. Hey! Darn it, Cham. Stop messing around. Just get back out here. Come on! "Come out already, Cham" Yucchi. What now? What's that sound? Hey... Aiko, what the hell are you doing? Aiko? Hey! Where'd you go? Answer me. Hey, Aiko? "This is really bad" "Get out of there" "It's here" What the hell? Who is it? Say something. Hey! Come out. Stop hiding! Quit your nonsense, dirtbag. "Get to the merry-go-round!" "Oh no oh no oh no" "Run!" "Hurry!" No... no! Help! Toshimaen: Haunted Park Study Abroad Centre Thank you. Hi, Anju. About tomorrow, right? Don't worry. Everyone can come? That's great! OK. See you tomorrow then. Saki? Is that you? You're Saki, right? It is you. Mrs Kobayashi, why are you here? I came to clean the house. We still haven't found a buyer for it. For Sale Honey, come over. It's Saki. Don't you remember? Yuka's childhood friend. I'm sorry. He's been like that ever since she went missing. Oh, can you wait here for a moment? Have You Seen Her? Kobayashi Yuka (age 18) I was given this but I have no use for it. If you don't mind, would you like to have it? I believe you love this place, no? You used to go there a lot with Yuka. And this... Doesn't it bring back memories? This is you and this is Yuka. I'd be glad if you can have this too. I think Yuka won't feel lonely if you can keep it with you. No, that's... You should keep this. Let's drink to Saki who is going abroad for her studies. —Cheers! —Cheers! Thanks, everyone. I'm so jealous you get to study abroad. She's not going on vacation, you know. Japanese girls are popular with guys overseas. You need to be careful. Is it going to be the time of her life? Oh my gosh, I'm so jealous! I'm saying, Saki is a real softie so she must be careful not to fall for some weird guy. Some weird guy? I know. The kind of guy who says "You're Japanese? Make me sushi." No one says that. There is. This guy the other day... You wouldn't believe how annoying he was. Anyway, isn't this so Instagram-worthy? Saki, are you all right? You look tired. I bet you're sad about not being able to see us. Homesick already? It's not like that. It's just I met someone I haven't seen in a while on the way here. Who? Yuka's mum. Yuka? As in Kobayashi Yuka? Are you for sure? I thought her parents moved out right after Yuka went missing. They did, but they came back to check on the house. It's for sale. It's been three years since Yuka went missing. How did she go missing anyway? Was she kidnapped or something? Come on, that's just a rumour. Saki, do you know anything about it? You grew up together. No, we grew up together but I don't know everything about her. Oh yeah, her mum gave me this. Tickets to Toshimaen? Wow, we used to go there all the time back in high school. Yeah. It's good until tomorrow. You're right. It's so like them to give what's almost expired. Hey, why don't we go? To Toshimaen? That too, but also... Yuka's house. —Great idea. —Let's go. —Doesn't it sound like fun? —It does. —Are we really going? —Why not? —Are you sure? —I saw her here. Kaya, don't. I'm sure they've left by now. Come on. What if the place is haunted or something? Cut it out, Chiaki. Let's ring the bell. —Don't! —You're such a chicken. Oh yes, I'm getting psyched up. —I'm ready. —Here I go. Come on, let's go. All right, let's leave. Nothing happened. What's wrong, Saki? I see something. —Where? —Up there. Where? I don't see anything. I wish there were. This is boring. Naturally... There's nothing. Sheesh. —I was hoping for something. —Me too. Don't scare me like that. Scaredy cat. Toshimaen Free Ticket Saki. Saki. Saki, promise you'll always be with me. You must always be with me too, Yuka. It's a promise. OK, I promise. Yuka? Yuka? Yuka? Yuka? —Those two are late. —Yeah. It's past the time we agreed upon. Maybe they don't want to come. Saki? Saki! What is it? I didn't say anything. Is everything OK? Yes, I'm fine. Sorry to keep you waiting. There you are. We made it. You're so late. I had to wait for Ami. —No, I waited for you! —You did? I don't care who's fault it is. You're late by eight minutes and 38 seconds. That's no big deal. Let's go now! Come on guys, hurry up! —Who has the tickets? —I'm so excited. Ami, you're buying us ice cream for being late. Anju was the one who was late. —What? —I see an ice cream stand there. I'm telling you, it wasn't me. Coming here really brings back memories. That makes you sound old. But I'm feeling nostalgic too. The merry-go-round is just as I remember it. Come to think of it the design is pretty bizarre. It looks French. —Rococo-ish? —That's it! Wrong! This merry-go-round was made in Germany 110 years ago. It was in the US before it was moved to Japan in 1971. It's a piece with much history. In other words this merry-go-round is the symbol of Toshimaen. Chiaki, how do you know all that? These are things every local should know. —It is? —Yeah. Nonsense! You just googled it. I'm so embarrassed. Wait... Saki, come on. Let's go. Sorry. What are you doing? —Hurry up. —Come on, Saki. Sorry. I really can't do this. I'm not ready. It's happening! It's coming! I'm so scared. Get me out of here. I'm so scared. That was really scary. —That was awesome. —She's so scared. —Is she crying? —She is. Ami. —You're so cute. —Really cute... Let's go ride on that. What's wrong, Ami? That's it, isn't it? What is? Haven't you heard? —What? —Toshimaen's curse. Tell her. Don't knock on the door of the old mansion. Don't respond in the haunted house. Don't look into the secret mirror. If you break any of the rules you'll be taken away to a secret place. That's the old mansion. Another one of Chiaki's urban legends. Someone probably made that up. Then you give it a try, Anju. —Sure. —No, don't do it. Why not? It's fine. —Let's go. —You said it. —No turning back. —I won't. I'm not responsible if anything happens. Don't worry, nothing will happen. This looks spooky. Back out now if you want. Enough of that. Chiaki, get me on camera. —I don't mind but are you sure? —Just do it. Ready? —OK. —Here we go. So, we're going to test out Toshimaen's curse. Saki will do it. Me? Anju, you're terrible. —Saki, you don't need to. Are you scared? Come on, everyone's waiting. Hey! What do you want? Oh... nothing. That was creepy! He gave me the chills. Ami, don't run away by yourself. Wait, are you crying? At this age? You're such a baby. I'm not crying. Ami... Ami, don't leave me. I'll be cursed. I don't care. You deserve it. Ami, I'm being taken away. What's that sound? What was that? Wait for me! That looks like fun. Wait, where's Kaya? Who cares about her? Ami, let it go. Saki, try calling her. OK. She's not picking up. Hey, what happened to your bag? What's this? I wonder what it is... Is it a photo? Chiaki, open it up. No freaking way. Maybe you got it from someone and forgot. That's quite impossible. Saki, are you all right? Thanks, Ami. How did that ever get inside her bag? I can't believe this. I just want to go home. —I'll hold your bag. —Thanks. It's Kaya. Kaya? Are you going back already? I want to play some more. Kaya, where are you? What? I can't hear you. Kaya? Saki... help me. Please. Hurry... It got cut off. What was that? Let's go home. Yeah, we should. Let's go look for Kaya. OK. Thanks. Why... What should we do today? What about karaoke? —Sounds good. —It's been a while. Count me in. How about you, Yuka? Maybe not today... Some other day? I see... I'll pass if Yuka can't go. Again? You didn't come the last time either. We're being nice by inviting you. You'll lose friends like that, you know. Then let's go without Yuka. —But... —It's OK. Let's go! —Come on. Get your bag. —All right! Thanks. I won't forgive you. Where in the world did Kaya go? Any response? No, she won't pick up. Does this feel off to you? What? I don't know. It just feels weird. You're worrying too much. Chiaki, what are you doing? We should be looking for Kaya. I am. How about asking the information centre to make an announcement? It's Kaya! Kaya? Saki, come right now. Something's wrong. Kaya, where are you now? The haunted house, I think. Come as soon as you can. What did she say? She's at the haunted house. Did she really said she was here? Maybe you heard her wrong. She can't be here. Let's go. I heard for sure. She's here. It's Kaya. Hello? Saki. Hey, everyone. Kaya, are you OK? Kaya? Hurry, come inside. No, I don't want to. Ami, we're friends, aren't we? Please. Hurry, come inside. I'm waiting. Help me. Quick. Kaya! Something must have happened. Let's go inside. Right. We can't go home without Kaya. Hey, wait! Anju! Closed for the day Kaya? Kaya... Don't cling on to me. I can't walk. I can't help it. What was that? It's just part of the display. Stop jumping at everything. Kaya? —Kaya? —Where are you? Your screaming is way more terrifying. Stop that. Let's get out of here. Yeah. Let's find Kaya and get out. For sure. Kaya? Kaya? Don't knock on the door of the old mansion... Kaya? Don't knock on the door of the old mansion... Don't knock on the door of the old mansion... Don't knock on the door of the old mansion... Don't knock on the door of the old mansion... Kaya, what's wrong? What was that? Anju! Saki! Chiaki! Dialling: Anju Where are you? I want to go home. Dad... Mum... What? Who is it? Answer me! Anju? Wrong Anju, what are you doing? Come out! Ami. I'm right here! Do you hear me? Did she respond? She did Oh no You're not supposed to respond What's that sound? Stop. Stop it! Ami! Ami? Ami, are you all right? Don't go off by yourself. I responded... What are you talking about? I responded. What should I do? What? What happened? I don't know. I just... Pull yourself together, Ami. We need to get out. —Chiaki? —Right now! Chiaki! Slow down. What's wrong, Chiaki? Chiaki! —Toshimaen's curse... —Stop it! I want to go home. Let's all go home. But Kaya's still... Who cares about Kaya now? —I want to go home! —Ami, don't be selfish. All right then. I'm going to call my mum. Hello, Mum? Can you hear me? I'm at Toshimaen now and... I agree with Ami. Let's go home. Not you too, Chiaki. What about Kaya? —But at this rate... —Chiaki! When did you become so uncaring? Really? You can pick me up? OK, I'll head over right now... Kaya's still inside. Let's go look for her, Saki. OK. Ami. Ami? Ami. Ami. Ami. Ami. —Hey, Yuka. —Saki. —Can I talk to you? —Sure. Let me borrow her, Yuka. What is it? Saki, what do you think about Yuka? What do you mean? Isn't she a party pooper? I think she doesn't like being with us. That's not true... So, we were thinking maybe we should keep a distance. It's not like we're going to ignore her or quit being friends. It's just I think Yuka likes to be by herself. What's that sound? I didn't do anything! I didn't do anything bad! You did. Ami? Ami? She won't answer her phone. Call her again. Anju. I think it's happening. —What? —Toshimaen's curse. Don't be ridiculous, Chiaki. There's no such thing. Then what happened to Kaya? She was taken away because she knocked on the door. Ami responded in the haunted house. We need to get out of here right away. The curse is just some made-up story. Get real. Ami? Anju? It's Ami. I saw her. She's here? Anju, it's too late! Ami's inside. We can't leave her. But this place is... Are you really going to leave her in there? Let's go, Saki. Chiaki. Ami? Ami? Ami, where are you? Ami? —Hey. —What? —Ami! —Let's get out of here. We can get away. It's not too late. Where are you? What are you saying? —Ami? —What about Ami and Kaya? —Ami? —Ami? Ami? Ami? Ami, where are you? Ami? Ami? I want to go home. I want to go home now. Thank god. I knew you were in here. I told you. It's too late now. Don't you get it? Chiaki? Chiaki! Anju, what's wrong? Anju! I warned you, didn't I? This happened because you won't listen to me. Anju! Stop talking like it was my fault! Anju. What was that thing? It's Yuka. What? Kobayashi Yuka. What are you talking about? Toshimaen's curse. So it is true. This is the secret place. We've been cursed. What are you saying? Get a hold of yourself. You didn't believe the curse. In any case, why would Yuka be here? Because Yuka did it too. Tell her. Why don't you say what you did to Yuka? Three years ago Let's take a picture. —Let's do it here. —Can everyone fit in? —Ready? —Yeah. —Here goes. —This is nice. Say "cheese". Do you know about this app? No. What's that? It's a photo app called B612. It makes you look so much better. —Wow, that's amazing. —Right? —We do look better. —It's true. You can get perfect skin with just one tap. I'm going to the toilet. See you back in a bit. What should we ride next? Yuka, do you have anything fun to share? What do you mean by anything fun? I'm asking because we're bored. Chiaki, anything fun? You're always asking that. Oh, what about this? Let me see. This? It looks fake. You're the one who asked. I don't know about this... —Look. —Why not? It looks fun. It's one of those scary things. Would you do it? No way. Never. Really? Can you do this? You'll be cursed Knock and you're doomed You really did it! The place's cursed —What was that? scared me. Are you getting cold feet? Since you're here, give it a try. That's right. Don't miss out on having fun. I can't do it, but I'm sure you can. Are all of you serious? I'm not responsible for what happens. Chiaki, don't tell me you really believe in this stuff. You never change. Give me the map. I'll mark it out for you. The Curse Of Toshimaen Don't knock on the door of the old mansion! Knock on the door. Chiaki, you're so nice. How lucky of you, Yuka. It's just an urban legend. Nothing's going to happen. Right, Chiaki? Important: How to break the curse Make sure to upload a video for proof. Do your best, Yuka. I'm rooting for you. —Here you go. —Thanks. Here. Good luck. —Sorry for the wait. —Welcome back. What's wrong? Nothing. —Let's get going. —All right. Let's go. —What's next? —Where should we go? It's all your fault, Anju. What? How can you say that? It's your fault. You showed us that video. Stop it, you two. You too, Saki. You think you didn't do anything wrong at all? So what if you were childhood friends? You shouldn't have asked her along. How could you say that? What do we do now? We need to get out of here. Main Entrance This way. What is this? What's going on? Is this part of the curse too? We can never get out of here? Anju... What? Chiaki's gone. Where did Chiaki go? Back in the Mirror House I remember her saying something. That we can escape. That it's not too late. Maybe she knows something we don't. Important: How to break the curse Ride the merry-go-round! Stupid fools. Stay stuck in here forever. What's that? What is this? Hey... Please... What's going on? Stop! Why didn't you tell me? Chiaki? Chiaki? Hey, do you hear that? Let's check it out. Look! It's Chiaki's. Don't tell me she ran away by herself. She was taking videos. We might find something. Ride the merry-go-round... and everyone will be saved. Let me watch it again. Ride the merry-go-round... and everyone will be saved. The merry-go-round... —Ride the merry-go-round... and everyone will be saved. Saki. And everyone will be saved. And everyone will be saved. And everyone will be saved. And everyone will be saved. And everyone will be saved. Saki, hurry! And everyone will be saved. Saki! What's wrong, Saki? The power's out. No! Anju, look! Park Facilities Electrical Room Electrical Room This is it. Merry-go-round Now we can get home. —Let's go. —OK. Anju, wait. What is it? Saki? Saki! Mum, Dad I want to go home I'm lonely Help me I miss Saki It's their fault I'll never forgive them Saki!

Don't worry. I'll always be with you. I'm sorry... I'm sorry, Yuka. Why? What's going on? You woke up? How do you feel? Take your temperature. You were lying in front of the merry-go-round. I'll go get the doctor. Sorry for the wait. —What's wrong? —Nothing. —Let's get going. —All right. Let's go. —What's next? —Where should we go? What's wrong, Yuka? What are these markings for? They told me to do it. You don't want to? No... I see. Then you don't have to. I'm so glad. I know you would say that. Oh yeah. This is for you. Saki, what are you doing? Let's go. I'll be right there. Come to think of it everyone will be happy if you do this. Don't you think? What do you mean, everyone? I only care about you, Saki. You're always trying to please everyone. Are you so afraid of being unpopular? Saki! Hurry up! Saki, we're going to leave you. Come on! OK. I get it. I'll be going then. You can keep this. See you. Saki, wait. Why should I? I don't want to be unpopular. Bye. Wait! What is it, Yuka? I'll do it. I'll try Toshimaen's curse. Have you heard of Toshimaen's curse? Yeah. Don't knock on the door of the old mansion. Don't respond in the haunted house. Don't look into the secret mirror. If you break any of the rules you'll be taken away to a secret place. To break the curse, ride the merry-go-round. —What about it? —So you knew. Of course. It was a pretty well-known urban legend. There's more to the story. Do you want to know? —What? —There's more? Yeah. There was a girl who didn't manage to break the curse. That girl didn't ride the merry-go-round and is still in the secret place together with her friend. That's how all urban legends end. Yeah. Why don't we try it out? Toshimaen's curse. I'm just kidding. Stop, you're creeping us out. This is a work of fiction with no resemblance to actual events or locales or persons.
