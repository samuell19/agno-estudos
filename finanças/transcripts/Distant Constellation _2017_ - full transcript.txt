You're late. The Boss is here. Get up! Halva, Halva. I brought Halva dessert. Halva, Halva, Halva. Bravo, bravo! Halva, Halva. Here's some Halva -- Lime doesn't stick to my walls. My face is cheerful. I loved her but she went to strangers. How about the Song of Marseille? Sing it, sing it! Arise, children of the Fatherland! Come on. Sing it! Sing it! Arise, children of the Fatherland! Come on. Arise, children of the Fatherland! Arise, children of the Fatherland! Come on. Arise, children of the Fatherland! You sing beautifully. Come on. Hello? Veronique? Where are you? You're sick? Me too. I've had bronchitis for 15 days. They don't know how to fix this. I don't want to stay on here, you know? Because they give me these useless medications. Drugs in the morning. Drugs in the night! I've had enough of this. They have no clue. They don't know what they're doing. Okay. Bye. I think I have a sometimes bad character. I want what I want-- immediately. It's not good, no? I don't have patience sometimes. Slowly, slowly. I want to know --to have my money, tickets and so... I'm a little... anxious. I was worse when I was young. And I did a lot of things that I will not repeat now. So is life. Tomorrow is Thursday. I have the famous doctor, Mr. Mario. He's not a specialist of this kind of sickness. My younger brother was born in 1915 a disastrous year for the Armenians in Turkey. Our family tried to survive. We were a very well-to-do family. We had a cow and a donkey. My grandfather had a mill where he prepared the best flour in our home town. But they burnt his mill. They would come into a house and knock it. If it's not open, they break the door. They were very bad bandits. They gathered all the Armenians. And they separated all the men. They killed them with knives. Strangled them with rope. They fired the gun at them. They burned the villages. Without letting out anybody. Even the animals were burned. In order not to be deported, we had to become Islam. My mother and grandmother went to the government, and wanted to accept Islam. So for a few years we had Turkish names. My name was Hasibe. My mother's name, Huriye. She was Mayrim. My younger brother, Kamil. My sister, Kadriye. Because she was Catherine. And my older brother, Mahir. My grandmother, Dilber. I can't remember the others, my father's mother's name. Just give me a minute. February, the 26th of February. That's the day of my birth. That's the day of my birth. That's the day of my birth. We'll have many things. We'll have a cake. We'll have a cake. On the 26th of February. In ten days. Ten days. Ten days. What is today? It's the 17th. It's the 17th. In 9 days we'll have it. We'll have it. We'll have it. You will be here. You will be here. Right? I'll take a lot of good photographs. I'll take a lot of good photographs. Very good. Very good. All of this is working. I'm not diabetic or anything. I'm in good shape. Everything is working. My head. Everything is very good. Even my eyes are good. I have a big camera. A big camera. I read the famous masterpiece of Nabokov -- Lolita. and he's writing his experience when he came to America with a young, young girl. Very young. He loves her like a father. And also she loves him like a father. But she has a sexual relation after. And so and so and so and I don't remember exactly the book but -- He writes that she led me to do this business. Fucking her with everybody. Lolita. Who said to me, a woman said to me -- You know she said to me, the first experience is difficult. The second difficult. The third, the fifth, the sixth. After, you get used to it. Yeah? You know in Paris, when I was in 1958, there were 500,000 call girls. In the streets. 500,000. Girls making love for money. If you are nice with her, they can help you, they can say, "Go there. They have this and that you can find..." "If you want," she said, "I can give you an address. You go there and there's a big party, sex party." I said, "I don't like this," I don't know. I don't like, the sex parties. I want, when I make sex, private. You and me. You and me. Maximum, two girls and me. But when we did the small sex parties in Izmir, I said goddamnit... I don't like. I don't like -- The best for me is you and me. The best. Private. In a room. Sex. And it's finished after. You forgot. They called the daughter of the dying man. She said she was busy and couldn't come. Is this acceptable? Yea... - Well, so is life. - True. What can we do brother. I am sick of your breath. You blow it in my face. Carry eucalyptus in your pocket. I left it in the room. I tell you to carry it in your pocket, take two even! Yes. It's a nasty smell for a person like me, who doesn't smoke. But the doctor gave me permission to smoke. Of course. This doctor... Just not too much... What a fine doctor! - I would kill him, give me his address. - Alright. So? - Someone is coming. - Just press minus 1. So your sister-in-law called? Your older daughter called? No. Your younger daughter called? - She didn't either. - But she called you recently? Recently?! Recently my mom was a young woman! My daughter called me, but the son didn't. So is life. Another round? We can go down, then up again. Excellent. Let's do it like that. They pressed at 2. It's ok, leave it alone. Let it go up to 2. It's going up. Don't tell them anything. Let them open the door. We keep enjoying ourselves. Come on. Come on, move it. Let's go, Izo. Can you move a bit forward? The cart won't fit in. The cart won't fit in. Ok - only for people then. It's ok for people, but the cart won't fit! Aren't you a person yourself? You are a person. So is life. Here we go. I'll take a photo, I'll take a photo. Let me see, let me see. I can't see it. I can't see it. I'll take a photo, I'll take a photo. I can't see it. I can't see it. My eyes... I can't see. I can't see. I can't see it. I can't see it. I can't see it. I can't see it. My eyes are bad. My eyes are bad. I keep it here. I keep it here. I have three cameras. Three studio cameras. Three cameras. Three... They have big lenses. Big lenses. I need to see the doctor. I don't know why. I don't know why. I don't know why. I don't know why. I don't know why. It goes here. It goes here. It goes here. It goes here. My eyes, I can't see. My eyes, I can't see. This is very bad. This is very bad. I need to see the doctor. There's nothing they can do to fix it. There's nothing. There's nothing. There's nothing. There's nothing. Because it's cancer. But I'm a photographer... Yes, indeed. They are out there. They are. I know this very well. But who are they? How do they look? That I don't know. - But why don't they make contact with us? - That's a good point. Maybe they're afraid we'll seize their lands, that's why. I see what you mean. What can we do brother, life is like that. You pressed zero. - You're really sure there are aliens out there? - Yes. But I can't say if they have hair or a beard. They don't admit it because they don't want us to panic. They hide it. We'll never know. Do vegetables grow there? What do they eat? Is there water or not? Is there water? Is there sea? - This all needs to get calculated. - True, true. - Maybe one day they will come land in this world. - Yes. One day. Now, in a short while, Slowly, slowly-- Your eyes will gently close. Don't resist. Receive nothing from the world. No pain. No weight. All questions will be answered. Sleep. Let go. Let go. Wait a second, wait a second. This goes there. This goes there. I think I've fixed it. I think I've fixed it. See if you can make it work. See if you can make it work. Take a look, take a look. Put it on there. Try. Yes, yes, yes, very good! Eyes in the eyes. Eyes in the eyes - with a complicit look! The streets in 1954 in Turkey was a disaster. We have to drive very slowly. Much better for me! Finally, I took the hand of Mimi. And she took mine. She raised her dress and I put my hand on her beautiful thighs. I started caressing it quietly. My touch gave her pleasure. Taking pleasure from my... She lowered... She was 31 years old... She lowered her eyes and I took that as a sign to continue. At times I stopped listening to Miss Mayer's voice, talking about the ruins of Ephesus. Miss Mayer had a big culture about archeology. The shock absorbers of the car were old, suddenly we were shaking up and down. The motor of the car was very old. All at once, like this, my hand... fell from Mimi's hand. You understand? From this my hand went like this. I caressed her thighs all the way up. She was very aroused. My caresses made her happy. I kept my hand inside her thighs. And I don't know how but she lowered her panties. She gave me another nod with her head and I started to caress her clitoris. My God! Then she had an orgasm. I was in pieces! She told me to finish. The heat was making her sweat and her smell was so strong. I opened a window and finally was able to catch my breath. I had a small jar of jam. It spilled over. It turned over. Everything became sweet. I had to wash it. All the people in our home town got poor. They lost everything-- money, property, houses. And their works. When you got married they would ask for money. We didn't have money for that. We were hardly pulling life together to live together. So... we never thought about marriage. So now I tell you if you have the time, and... chance to marry you should marry, get married -- and have a family. It would be nice to have children. I love children. And later in Istanbul, 1940 to 1942, I took care of a baby girl. An Armenian girl. Her name was Dianna. And I loved her so much that when I left to go to another job, I cried. When the time for her dinner and supper came, - she had a mother, a mother and a father - but they hired somebody else. She said, she was two years old, she told them, "You don't love me," she said. And she told her mother, "You don't love me!" she said. She said, "How do you know that?" She said, "When I was falling down, Aztrik would pick me up and kiss the place and it would get better. You don't do that!" Life has been good for me. I worked hard and then when I retired I was cooking-- making jams and jellies and cakes... cookies... Giving them away to friends. I had many good friends. And I wasn't alone at all for this friendship. And here also, it's the same I slept, did I? I'm sorry -- I drop like that -- What a fool working in the laundry room, Serkis. He named his bird Yolanda! What a name, Yolanda! Press 2. You're just standing staring at the door. Do you think life is a dream? It's not a dream. It's an illusion. An illusion. Yes. So you believe in life after life? We'll find out, on the other side. Yes. We will all turn into soil one day. Would we find heaven? Would we find hell? Not so clear where we would end up. 1, 2, 3, 4 I was here before. Life is like that. Revolution! Now here-- I'm not happy and not unhappy. I'm... like this. I read. I spend my time to play a little, not too much. Before I used to play, three hours, four hours. But now I cannot play three hours, four hours. But slowly, one hour or two hours. I play the old songs. The old pieces, I cannot play the new ones. I have an idea. You don't have to ask to -- We have to think about -- I was thinking, I was thinking that I need somebody in my life. Because my life is empty now. Alright, music, things like this. I don't know yours. We can arrange something together if you want. As... to live separately. Being married. Think. This is things that... You cannot say yes. I don't have a character of jealousy. If you want you can go to the -- You can go to the lawyer, if you want. Everything what you want. But, your advantage, you have a small advantage that I will die before you. You cannot bargain with death. You will have all my -- I don't have big money. I have my retreat. About 2,000 euros or 3,000. You think. Because I feel good with you. You're nice with me. I don't get bored with you. Do you understand? You understand? If you say to me, "I want to go with my friends, to dance." Alright, it's not a problem. It's natural. It's natural because I have 75 years and you have 30. This is the -- Look, look. It's light over there. Go to the light. Go to the light. Beautiful. Beautiful. Beautiful. Stop, stop. Stop, stop. Stop, stop. Stop, stop. Look at me. Look at me. Look at me. Take a look. Take a look. Take a look. Very beautiful. The car hit you as it was moving backwards? Yes. Do you have any pain in your body? In my back, and my chest also hurts. - It hurts in the back and in the front? - Yes. - It was a truck. - A truck? My God! - I couldn't see the backside. - I see, I see. What can we do? This is the third time. The third time! I hope God will protect you. The policeman at the station said, "Look, God gave you three chances. At the fourth one, you will die," he says. Then I said, "Let God save me and take you instead!" He laughed. He understood that I was joking. You are too young to have accidents like this. That's not how it should be. The drivers are inexperienced, what can I do!? The drivers are inexperienced! All happens for a reason. The Fatih Avenue is so wide! The light is green when I start walking, but before I reach the other side the light is already red and the cars are racing. You need to always be on your guard. Yea. I get so scared. Two times I couldn't figure out which direction Kurtulus was, so I crossed the avenue twice. At the lights where the underpass is -- - You should just cross at the next light. - At the next light, right? When the light changes, the cars stop. Then there is a gap, you could just cross there! That's true. That's true. - Why should you wait at the first light... - That's true. I am very sad for you, I will pray for you. No need for that, God is on top of it. Is there a pain in your arm? When you write your book, don't write my real name. Find a -- Selma. Call me Selma, or somebody. I don't want anybody to see that book with my name in it. It's dangerous. Because I'm afraid. We have lived here. We have seen many things. They would torture me. What I told you was the truth. Christmas, Christmas. Hello. Goodnight. Christmas, Christmas. Christmas, Christmas. Hello. Goodnight. Christmas, Christmas. Omer, brother, it's late. Get up. Come on. Good morning. Get up, it's time. You need to pay the bride's family. - That's a heavy responsibility. - Yes. - How old are you? - 22. Why didn't you learn any jobs so far? Brother, how could I? For instance, learning electricity... Only fields, that's it. We only worked in the fields. Anyway. Now you are here. Learn it here, there is not much being an unskilled laborer. In only two years, now you are 22, you could be a chief when you are 24. You can't be an unskilled laborer, they can lay you off. Once you have a title, a craft, and a good fortune, you can go to Russia, America, you can work everywhere. Without a craft, it's hard. You would do only cleaning or shoveling. It's hard. Think about it. You'll get married soon, have a wife and kids. Here now you get 1500, when you become a chief, you would get 5000. Once you become a chief, you can bring kiwi or banana to your house, instead of oranges. Which one is better? It's better to get a higher salary. Maybe you could eat these once or twice a year, when you get 1500. When you get 5000, you can fill your house with them, and eat them as you please. It's like that. Be always alert when you are working. Don't get sleepy. - Don't be lazy. - I won't. Seven friends we went to Moda Beach. We jumped into the water one by one... We swam far away... We were talking while swimming. We talked about this and that. After 10 or 15 minutes had passed... we realized we swam far from the coast. But we weren't seven people anymore. We were six. One of us said, "There was seven of us when we came. What happened? Stephan is not here. Stephan, our friend, where is he?" We looked around, we couldn't see him. We looked towards the beach, Stephan was not there. Stephan was not there... "Hurry up friends, our friend is in trouble. Let's swim back quickly!" We swam back immediately. We went back, "Stephan, where are you?" We searched here and there... everywhere... "Did you see from where he went to the sea? Let's go and check there." We went to where he jumped into the water. We saw him at the bottom of the sea - there he was! He was kneeling down, he was like a stone. One of us dived in right away, grabbed him and brought him to the surface. We put him over the pier. We massaged his body. We stretched his arms. We opened his mouth, blew breath in, blew breath in. At the end, he inhaled and came back to life. He didn't swallow any water! All that time at the bottom of the sea, for about 30 minutes, he didn't swallow any water. He was very stiff, maybe because of how cold the water was... The water must've locked up his body... Without swallowing water, with his mouth closed, without breathing, he stayed down there intact...
