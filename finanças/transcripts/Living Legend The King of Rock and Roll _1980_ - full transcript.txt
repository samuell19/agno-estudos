How are you feeling Eli? - Great, is everything set? - Well everything except, Susan. - How many times we have to go through this Susan? - As many times as it takes to get the point across. So run along, you have thousands of people waiting for you. - I don't play to thousands, I can't related to thousands, I play to one person, you. - You relate to every moon-eyed female that gets in your way. - Don't start that again. - Now come on Eli, we're running on a pretty right schedule. - You be there tonight. ♪ Give up ♪ Boy don't fight me ♪ I was born to win ♪ Now you come, yes come to me ♪ And you want to walk out of the game ♪ ♪ But I'm not the girl next door ♪ ♪ And most often is what we are playing ♪ (crowds cheering) ♪ Give up ♪ I was born to win (crowds cheering) (upbeat funky music) - Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Eli Canfield.

Yeah what's the situation there, is it clear? - The police are holding the crowds back at street level. But you must understand Mr. Bergman, should there be any damages at all, we must hold Mr. Eli Canfield accountable. - Mr. Canfield is responsible for the top floor and the top floor only, now the rest of it is your problem. - They can have them bring some food up to the room. - Right. We'd like some food in the room by the time we get there too. Yeah about five minutes. How you feeling Eli? - Oh, okay. - Good show tonight.

Okay good.

Ask him to wait please, and close the door Chad. - Yes ma'am. - Not all of Eli Canfield's fans could get in the concert tonight, some of those people are here at the hotel, do you really think he's going to put in an appearance here? - I really hope so, I've been waiting a long time to see him. - You might have to wait a long time yet. - I don't care, I'll wait all night if if I have to. - I'm not walking out on you Eli, I'm running out. I can't take it anymore. - I know these concert tours are hard on you Susan but dammit they are me too. - You have people waiting on you hand and foot, they bend over backwards to please you. I'm treated like another piece of baggage but no more. - Oh he's kind, thoughtful, he's a perfect gentleman. - They're nothing but pimps. They supply you with women everywhere. - And just how in the hell do you think I met you? - [Susan] You son of a-- - Susan people don't run out on me, I get rid of 'em but they don't run out on me. - You're crazy, you know that Eli, you're crazy. - Well I think he's real cool, 'cuz you know, he's got it all together. - I could almost feel sorry for you Eli. Goodbye Eli. (people chattering) - Okay, I'll see you on the 10th. That was Houston, some kind of mix up with the ah, hotel reservations. - Oh, take care of that before you go to bed tonight, okay? - Working on it now. Um, Susan's gone. - You wanna run that by me again? - Susan's gone, she and Eli had a hot and heavy fight earlier, she walked out, Eli hasn't left the room all night. - Son don't you ever let anybody tell you miracles don't still happen. Here's how we're gonna handle this thing. (upbeat rock music) Eli, you awake son? - Yeah, come in. - Well boy, turned them away again tonight. - Yeah, they were lucky, I was lousy. - Oh now don't say that, you know you're your own worst critic. Listen, we got a bunch of people out here. - Susan left me. - Yeah, Dean told me about that. Listen I take no pleasure in saying that I told you so son, but I have been saying all along that Susan's just in this thing for what she can get for Susan. We gotta remember, that this kind of life's not for everybody. It's hard on a person, especially if you're not part of the show like Susan. Wears on a body, makes 'em mean. Then next thing you know, they're trying to tear you down. You see, people like Susan are fragile things, they're not tough like we are. - Should of taken better care of her. - No, listen, no woman ever had it better than Susan. You gotta remember, she walked out on you, you didn't leave her stranded. Now I want you to get up from there and fight this thing, you gotta start remembering who you are. Now listen, get up from there, come on. I wanna take a look at you. Right now, who are you? You're Eli Canfield and don't the whole damn world know it.

Okay just make 'em comfortable and I'll be right in, okay? - [Dean] Well of course you realize that Eli's time is money so it's more of a concern for a record-- - Mr. Burke, Mr. West, no, no keep you seats boys. Good to see you. - [Mr. West] Yeah, good to see you Mr. Cannon. - Well now boys, shall we get started? - I don't know which was better that time, your singing or my piano. - Ah neither of us, John on the guitar. - Oh, that's low. - Who's the girl? - Her? Oh that's Jeannie Loring, nice huh? - Better than that. You know her very well? - Not as well as I'd like to. She says she'd rather be friends, can you believe that? - Oh! (laughs) - Oh I invited her to stick around for the party, is that alright with you? - Any friend of yours. - Have mercy on me will you? Suppose we just lay it all right on the table, just what does Susan want out of this divorce action? - [Mr. West] Two million. - Two million? Thought you boys were on our side. - We're talking about a flat settlement Mr. Cannon, with all parties in full agreement before we go to court. Well considering the original demands that Mrs. Canfield's attorney's made, I think Mr. Burke and I have worked out a very compatible arrangement. - And I'm in complete agreement with my partner. - Well now just purely as a comfort to me to know you boys are so damn pleased with yourselves. Dear lady, you were right when you said Susan'd break Eli's heart, should of also added that she'd try to rob him blind. Every time I think about how that gracious lady's heart bleed because of the way that little... Because of the way Susan treated Eli, well it's just, that's too much. That girl's a schemer boys. Now she walked out on Eli a year ago, down in Miami. The poor boy, never had nothing, just like his folks before him, simple, clean living, honest people. Now she wants to rob him of all the money that he's worked his whole life for. - Perhaps we could go back to Mrs. Canfield's attorneys? What do you think Mr. Burke? - I think you and I have just witnessed one of the greatest performances in Gentleman Jim Canon's career. Now suppose we get Eli in here? - You'll deal with me. - You mean you handle his personal life as well as his career? - They're one and the same, Mr. Burke, one and the same. (people chattering) - Experience tells him from that time we were all exhausted and and Curley broke his G string. (laughs) Would you like for me to show you around this palace? - Oh no thanks Teddy, why don't you get us a drink? - I guess it's a start. Hey Gordy! - How you doing? - [Teddy] Oh just fine, just fine. - What'll you have? - It's for somebody special. Sweeten 'em. - Relax. - How you making Teddy? - Oh like a one-legged man at an ass-kicking contest. - Well, I'll say. (door creaking) - Hi. - Hi, I hope you don't mind my taking the grand tour. - Not at all, is the party getting dull? - It's been dull all night, you weren't there. She must of been very special. - She was. Do you like the house Miss. Loring? - You know my name? - Teddy told me. - Well then, he must of told you he invited me. - Yeah but you're not the type of girl that Teddy usually winds up with. - Who said he's wound up with me? - Teddy's one of my best friends. - I hardly know him. (upbeat country music) - [Male Reporter] Mrs. Canfield? - Do you have a statement to make at this time? Any statement at all? They're coming out. - [Female Reporter] Mrs. Canfield? - Ladies and gentlemen, please, please, now we're going to cooperate, we're going to cooperate, but we'd just like to have these questions one at a time. Please now okay? - What was the judges decision? - Well the judge granted Miss. Canfield a decree of divorce. - What were the-- - Now wait a minute sweetheart, wait just a minute, let me finish now. Furthermore I was gonna say that all parties involved are just totally in agreement about this thing, and I don't want you folks to go printing it was a bloody fight in there now. - [Darly] What were the ground? Mental cruelty or infidelity? - I don't believe I know your name sweetheart, what was it-- - Darly Fry. - Darly Fry, well listen sweetheart, you and I both know that those are just technical terms and don't mean a thing now. - Well how about if Eli answers one? - [Jim] Sure. - We got word the night your wife walked out that you jumped into bed with-- - [Jim] Please now, calm down, calm down! - [Male Journalist] Come on, come on. - [Jim] Alright please, ladies and gentlemen, please, please, calm down now, calm down. Everything's fine. - Eli please, will you just calm down? - Now come on folks, let's just give us a break here will you? This whole thing has been real hard on Eli. I mean Eli's just been heartbroke.

Come on over here David Allan. (audience clapping) All I got to say is that was really tremendous, well great. - Thank you, how you doing? - Fine. - It's been a long time since I've been here. - Isn't that the song from your latest movie? - Yes that's from Buckstone County Prison. - Your career really seems to be zooming now, how about telling us about it. - Well I've got a new book out, about my life called, "Just For the Record", that I wrote, and I'm working on a new album now, so I would say things are looking up pretty well for us. (audience clapping) I thank you for the applause, but you know there's someone else that I feel deserves the applause a lot more than I do. And there's something I have to say here tonight, and I hope that I don't offend anybody or make anybody mad. - Did I miss something David? - No, as a matter of fact with you permission, you're not going to miss anything. - Okay David, you've got my attention, but take it away. - You know I've been really upset lately about some things I've been reading in the papers, about a friend of mine. I really don't think that he deserves the kind of publicity that he's been getting and I know most people know that I was in prison, but what they don't know is that there was a man involved, helping me get out of prison, and that man was Eli Canfield. (audience murmuring) I don't blame you folks, I probably wouldn't believe it either if I'd read all the junk that I've been reading about Eli in the papers lately, and it's, it just doesn't make any sense to me, because I know Eli Canfield, and I know he's a good man and I'm really proud to say that he's my friend. (audience clapping) - If I know the egomaniac that runs that show, this whole thing gonna be on the wires by morning. - What's that? - You are now? - Yeah I reckon so. - [Eli] That girl you're trying to put to the make on recording studio. - Jeannie Loring? - [Eli] Yeah. - Oh she's something ain't she? - Know where she lives? - [Chad] Yeah. - Run over and pick her up, think I'm gonna take her to a movie. - Yeah, sure. - [Eli] And tell Dusty to bring that guy in. - Okay.

Oh, I'm sorry, I'm just not really used to dealing that way. - [Eli] How much for all of them? - [Salesman] For all of these? - Oh and you did bring bullets didn't you? - Yes sir, they're right here in the case. - [Dusty] Say when, one hundred, two hundred, three hundred, four hundred, five hundred, six hundred, seven hundred, eight hundred, nine hundred-- - When! I mean, that's going to cover everything. Ah, well Mr. Canfield, thank you very much, I hope you enjoy all of these and you can keep the case. It's been a real pleasure Mr. Canfield, thank you.

Well what we gonna do about the car? - Oh that's alright Eli, it was a wreck ever before I saw it. - Hand me the keys. What if you and I trade cars? - You kidding? - Even swap. - [Boy] Are you crazy, take it. - [Girl] Take it man. - You'll have an original Eli Canfield car. - Yeah!

You still having trouble getting to sleep? - Yeah when I'm working I'm alright, when I'm not I just can't get it all together. I'm still taking those pills you sent over though. - I want you to try getting to sleep without the pills. - You through playing doctor? - Okay, thank you Solou, bye-bye now. Well we got it all nailed down son, Solou's got the concert halls all ready to go, and the tour starts in London, what do you think of that? - Impressive. - I want you to get the plane ready, for a flight out of here say, a week before the London concert. Let's make it on the 15th. - Ah we have a charity concert on the 15th. - Alright then we'll do it on the 16th, just take care of it. - Alright. Oh um, Dr. Bradley's waiting to see you in the study. - Been waiting long Doc? Here, sit down, take a load off your feet, let me get you a drink. - No thanks. - My boy Eli's alright ain't he? - Your boy as you call him is 42 going on 60, he's wound up tighter than a cheap watch Jim. - Alright then you give him something to unwind him.

Nothing, I mean nothing is going to upset this overseas tour, you understand that. - [Dean] You know where this is all gonna end up don't you? - Gentlemen, Jim Cannon, the personal manager of Eli Canfield said today that rumors the entertainer was hospitalized due to a serious illness are just that, rumors. We have a report now from Al Ramey. - Eli wants to be in tip-top condition when he makes that overseas tour. Now we wouldn't lie to Eli's fans, would we? No sir, Eli is just fine, he's just fine. - So a reassuring report tonight for the fans of Eli Canfield, Scott? - John elsewhere in Nashville today we had these stories... (reflective music) - [Susan Voiceover] I'm not walking out on you Eli, I'm running out, I can't take it anymore. - [Dr. Bradley Voiceover] I mean it Eli, you gotta stop pushing yourself so hard, you're not 20 anymore. - [Jim Voiceover] Now we got a career here to worry about son, and that's all that's important. - [Hospital Intercom] Emergency, Dr. England, report to Emergency Room B, Dr. England, report to Emergency Room B. (peaceful music) - Teddy? About time you got you butt up here. (Teddy chuckling) - I've been here every day, they wouldn't let me in, said you needed a rest. - That's what they tell me. - You have the right to you know. (Teddy sobbing) - Is that for me? - What the hell yeah, I thought I'd lost you man, I've seen dead men look better than you when they wheeled you in here. - You thought your paychecks were gonna stop huh? - What the hell kind of thing is that to say? I've been with you from the start, I'm Teddy Coborn, I was there when they wouldn't throw a dime in your cup. That's the first time I've seen that old ball of slick back hair in a long time. He's cock of the walk, strutting around on stage, strumming a 20-tar guitar. You remember him? - Vaguely, I wonder whatever happened to him. - Man his flat his ass in the hospital bed. You know Eli? I think when you get out of here, we oughta go looking for that boy. Well, guess I'd best sneak on out of here before the sentries start patrolling again. You take care of yourself now you hear? I mean if you check out, who's gonna take custody of me? - Teddy, you're a real good friend. Probably the only damn one I ever had. - Looking great sir, looking great, you don't believe just 10 days of rest is all you needed? Listen, I got some good news for you, I'm gonna check you out of this hotel, huh how about that? Ain't nothing but sick people around here anyway. Get you back home, where you belong. What you reading there? Listen don't worry about a thing son, I've been talking to the booking agents on the phone and we're gonna be able to reschedule that Atlanta thing, you ain't gonna miss a thing. 'Course you're gonna have to do it after we get back from the overseas tour but, you know like I said, don't worry about a thing, everything's gonna be alright, it's gonna be fine. Listen son, I'm gonna have to go, I got a million things to do, but I'll tell you what, you're looking good, I'll see you back at the house now, okay, okay looking good son, looking mighty good. - Is Eli ready? - Ready to go. - Okay good look, go bring the car around to the front and wait there okay, Gentleman Jim wants the press and TV boys to catch Eli leaving the hospital. - Got you covered. - Okay good, Norm's got the car, Eli, you look great, you about ready to say goodbye to this place. - Yeah, out of here and right back on the tour, right? - Right. - Look like I'm ready? - You really look better. - Yes sir, top of the world boss. - Just what I though. - Smiling and looking well, Eli Canfield left the hospital today, we talked with his road manager, Dean Bergman. Bergman told us that Canfield for the last two days has been working on his European tour. Reporting from Memorial Hospital, this is Rust Debuke. - Dusty? Find Dean and tell him to get into the office right now. (upbeat funky music) - Eli? You've hardly said two words since we left the hospital. You're alright Eli. You're back home and I'll look after you. I'll be here to look after you from now on. - You wanted to see me? - Close the door. - Is something wrong? - Now you're a bright young man, you tell me? - Oh, I don't quite understand what you're getting at. - Alright suppose I spell it out for you. Just how in the hell did this Jeannie Loring get to be such a permanent fixture around here? - Oh it's Eli, you know how Eli likes to have-- - I know what Eli likes. Eli likes variety, that's what Eli likes, that's what he needs. Now how many times do I have to tell you that? - Well I tired, I brought in a couple of girls but he still-- - Can't I trust anybody in this organization, the next thing you know they're moving in. No, don't tell me. - [Dean] What was I supposed to do? I mean Eli told us to bring her clothes in, I can't tell him she's not welcome here. - Son of a bitch I can't believe what I'm hearing. Alright who brought her into the house in the first place? - Teddy. - Well, I should of known that. Alright I just gotta run a loyalty check around here. Alright you get Chad, and you tell him to get Teddy in here right now. And I wanna show you what I'm talking about when I speak about loyalty in this organization. And you get out of here. (county music) - Oh hell, damn. - Chad? Chad son, is that you? Hey what you doing man? - I'm just leaving Teddy. - Come on man, let me in the car here. Get your hand off there you turkey I'm coming in. Found it, I found it. - What you find Teddy? - Get your hands off that, it's a surprise. Come one man, let's cruise down the street see if we can't find us another bar, and find some leg, huh? - Teddy my god you-- - That's right, me Teddy, you Chad. Come on, feed the horses and let's go. - Well might as well, it was gonna happen sooner or later anyway. - You hear me don't you boy? - Like siren notes on a bugle. - Wait outside, I'll call you if I need you. - Oh, boy you're just a real big disappointment to me. - Does that mean I don't get the car Saturday night? - You brought that Loring girl into the house, and you're gonna have to take her out. Got to do it for Eli's career. See that's all that matters here. Take her out son, or I'll have to take you both out. (door closing) (tense music) - Teddy? - Alright it's plain to me if you'd thought-- - Where's he at? - What are you talking about? - [Chad] Teddy, where's he at? - He's in the study. - Come on Dusty. - Alright. - Eli, you seen Teddy? - No, what's wrong? - Oh he's flying high again, I can't find him. - It's a big house, he's around here somewhere, we'll find him. - You and Dusty check the house, Jeannie and I will look outside, probably roosting in a tree somewhere. (tense music) - Anything? - Nothing. - Damn, just like the one you started out with. (Jeannie laughing) - Teddy? Come out, come out wherever you are. - Isn't he a little too old to be playing this? - Yeah, I think he is, but you know how Teddy is. (guitar strumming) He's at the pool. There he is. Hey Teddy! - Hey yourself! Look what I found, I found it man, I found it. - He's gonna hurt himself Eli. - Come on Teddy, get down before you fall. - Well don't you see? It's the guitar. Now we can go find that skinny kid. - I see it Teddy but get down before you get hurt. Come on Teddy, don't fool around, that thing's plugged in. - Oh it won't work. We'll never find you again, I'm sorry. I tried to find... I tried... (electricity sparking) - Teddy! (amp exploding) - Get him, get him out. - Get an ambulance, we've gotta get Teddy to the hospital. - It's no use. - Get him to the hospital it'll be alright. - Eli, it's no use. - What'd you do to him? Well what the heck did you do to him? - You're talking out of your head son. Now just shut your mouth a minute and take it easy. I mean, my god, we got a dead man here, let's have some respect. Alright Chad I understand how you feel, you feel responsible for him because you brought him here, but nobody blames you for it son, I mean, it was just an accident. You saw it, everybody saw it, it was just an accident, nobody's responsible. - Yeah, it was an accident. (funky music) - Eli, Eli son, listen, listen to me, now I know Teddy was with us for a long time but we just can't let this thing get us down now okay? Now listen, I wanna get you upstairs, come on. - I'll see to it that he gets some rest. - No, no, I'd like you to wait here, we'll talk. Come on son. Hello honey this is Jim Cannon, right listen, have Dr. Bradley stop out by the house will you? Right, okay thank you now. Well now Miss Loring, we can have our little chat, would you like to sit down? Well, I'll tell you I'm just afraid Eli's taking this thing real hard, him just being out of the hospital and all. We just may have to cancel some of our commitments. - Why don't you stop the phony tears and get to the point? - Well Miss Loring I was just trying to be gentle with you but ah, you're a strong young lady so I'll just lay it out for you. Eli asked me to express his gratitude for all the things you've done for him and to let you know that-- - Oh no you don't. No you don't! (door slamming) (guitar music) - Eli, Eli please unlock the door, Eli, Eli, please, Eli! Eli! - That's the way it is sweetheart. You be sure to let me know where you're gonna be now and I'll send you things along. (melancholy piano music) (car horn honking) - What do you want? - Come on, let me in. - I'm sorry Mr. Perkins, my orders are that you've been fired and I can't let you inside. (tires screeching) - No, no listen, the album is not done, but listen, right, I understand your point of view son, but listen, you're not trying very hard to understand mine. Alright we do the benefit tonight, and then tomorrow we start on the greatest overseas tour of our career. Right. (door closing) Alright, listen to me now, there's something else I want you to think about while we're gone, when we get back we got to talk some new percentages. Okay, right. Well don't be bashful Doc, just bust right in. Alright you got an itch, go ahead and scratch it. - I want you to cancel this benefit tonight, and the concert tour. - Why the hell should I do that? - Because I'm readmitting Eli to the hospital. - No you aren't. - Now shut up Jim, this time you're gonna listen to me. I can't continue to treat Eli here, he's gotta have full hospital facilities. And I don't care what you say, this time you're not gonna change my mind. - Don't you think you're blowing this thing just a little out of proportion doctor? - My god, what does it take to get thought to you? Eli's killing himself with pills, just look at him. He's getting to a point, he can hardly function. Now against my better judgement I've been treating him here but no more, he's going back into the hospital. - There's nothing wrong with Eli, Eli's never been in better health, you know why, because he's got a healthy career. And that makes him a healthy man. - Then I'm through. Find Eli another physician. And Jim, I'd watch my blood pressure if I were you. - I got some furniture here to be delivered, where do you want it? - Okay, go on in. (upbeat funky music) - Hurt my damn knees up, knock all the skin off them. - [Eli] Why'd Chad and Jeannie walk out on me? Why is everybody walking out on me? - Take it easy Eli. - They walked out together didn't they Dusty? They left together. - Look, why don't you try and get some rest Eli, you've got a concert tonight. - I'll rest, after we fix those two. Jeannie fancies herself some fancy singer, we'll make damn sure that don't happen. Chad, we'll make sure he don't work for anybody ever again. Dusty nobody walks out on me, nobody. - Eli, son? Dusty take a break outside. Eli let me talk to you son, come over here. - Where's the band, they get here yet? - No, they're gonna be at the concert tonight. - But I need them here now, I've got to rehearse. I gotta remember the lyrics. - Eli, Eli, son, listen to me. I want you to get control of yourself. I want you to get all of this junk out of your head. Concentrate on your career. See your career's important 'cuz it's strong, and it makes you strong. Yourself, and your career, that's what I want you to remember. - Mr. Cannon what's up? - Get in here we gotta rehearse. Come on hurry, we ain't got much time. (band murmuring) - You um, wanted to see the posters we're gonna use in the overseas tour, so I had the printer send one over. Okay boys. Well what do you think? - I think that is the gaudiest damn thing I have ever seen, he'll love it. Alright you boys can just leave it. (funky music) - Wait a minute, wait a minute. Who are you? - Hey man I'm Jay Setser. - Well let's get one thing straight up front Jay, people pay to hear me sing, and not to hear you play. Let's do it again. Hold it! What in the hell you trying to do? We're supposed to be doing this together, you're trying to wreck my career, you play like your damn fingers are broke. I can't even hear the bass. And I asked you not to play so damn loud! - Hey man, dig it, you understand, 'cuz it's not even worth it man. - Come back, you come back here. You don't walk out on me, nobody walks out on me! - [Jay] The whole thing ain't worth it. - Hell, get, get out of here, all of you, I don't need you, get out! I need people round me that are with me, not against me, now get! Get out, I don't want you around any more. Nobody, you can't trust nobody. Get out of my house. - Eli, what the hell's wrong with you? - [Eli] You walked out on me. - Man that's what I come back here to get straightened out. - You walked out on me. (crashing) - Eli, don't get up. (Eli panting) Now you listen to me Eli. I didn't walk out on you, I was fired. Canon got rid of me, just like he got rid of Susan, Jeannie and Teddy.
