[lion roars] [oil machine humming] [car skids] [electronic music] [music continues] [gunshot] [gunshot] [jazz music] (male #1) 'Hey, what's going on?' [muffled chattering] [banging] [engine revving] [revving continues] [chain rattling] You're forgettin' something. Pick it up. Old super-spade didn't wanna take the smack. 'He was gonna leave it for the blues.' Hey, take that stupid mask off. [engine revving] [laughs] We did it. Man, we did it. 'We got the dope and the bread. Two for the price of one.' Hey, man, don't give me that motherfuckin' jive. I tol' you no fuckin' with dope. 'What the hell was goin' on?' We got buyers for the smack. It's that simple. You know the heat from that dope is gonna burn your motherfuckin' ass. You let us worry-- (male #2) 'Hey, man, take the shit outta your ears.' I told you I don't touch scag. That shit is bad for the present. Now, I'll take my cut from the cash. Alright, alright. Don't get hot. [jazz music] [van stalls] What's the problem? What're we stopping here for? She's choking. It, uh, could be feedback from that cyanide converter. It's dangerous. Better take a look at it. [Hook reloads the gun] [gunshots] [groaning] Suckers. Goddamn it. [breathing heavily] [sighs] [softly] Motherfucker. [dramatic music] [waves swooshing] [tires screeching] [car honking] [tires screeching] [tires screeching] [police siren wailing] [van crashes] [wailing continues] [van explodes] Mama...mama, is that you? Yes, son, it's your mama. Are you hurtin' bad? No, not too bad. I'm just sorry you had to come to a place like this. Oh, that's alright. I'm just sorry it had to happen. Why'd you do it, Curtis? You know you can't mess with the man. Aw, mama, sometimes a man has to do what he has to do, that's all. Yes, but they're gonna put you in jail just as soon as you're able to leave here. (mama) I've tried all my life to do the best I could for you. Oh, I know you have, mama. Don't you worry. The only thing I've done better than gettin' in trouble is getting out of it. Jus' tell me now that you won't do anything foolish. And you're gonna take care of yourself? You know I'll do that. You just take care of yourself for me. [inmates jabbering] (guard #1) 'Ever since he left Brooklyn' 'Alston keeps tripping over his own trunk.' 'He doesn't know how to stop.' Hook, Curtis Xavier. (guard #1) Okay. Alex, take off his leash. Mm-hmm. (guard #1) Okay, he's all mine now. Okay, showtime, Hook. Take it all off and put it on the counter. - Hook, Curtis Xavier. - Xavier. One belt, leather, black and what-what kinda buckle would you call this? Gold brother. 18 carat. (guard #1) What'd ya say? Speak up. I said gold. 18 carat gold. - 18 carat gold. - Ha, ha, ha! What are you laughin' about? Only gold you got's in your mouth. That's what all my friends call me "golden mouth." Shirt...uh, blue...silk. Shower's over there. If you need any help with the hard parts, just call. I think I can handle it myself, my man. Not in The Slams, baby. Nobody can handle it all by themselves in The Slams. (guard #1) 'Face front. Hold the card on your chest.' 'Memorize your CPI number. Stencil it on your possessions'' 'California Penal identity and cell bracelet' 'must be worn at all times' 'and shown to any of the prison staff on demand.' Any tampering with loss of or exchange of these identity items.. Will be considered illegal activity and punishable with solitary confinement. (guard #2) You're in Cell 37. (guard #2) Some brothers in there to ease your orientation. (Hook) You mean square me away, man? Open up, Walt. (inmate #1) Got a streak from the warden's office. They want you to step and fetch it. Looks like you gonna be a special dude around here. They temme the only special dudes around here are faggots. [guard #2 laughing] Look out, Walls! (inmate #1) Ouch! Watch my shirt. (Hook) This shit is crazy. I think Gordon and Howard both really blew it. (Hook) Right on. Hook. Cigarette? You know I don't smoke no cigarettes, Mr. Warden. (warden) Hook, you know why these guys are here. They got hard information that the syndicate's got a contract out on you. We don't give a shit about the murder. We'll let you off this time. We want the dope, Hook. And the money. We can give the DA a solid narcotics case against the Syndicate, if you'll cooperate. So you're gonna sing the same old song, Sergeant. I'm here on a one-to-five for a concealed weapon and stolen car. You know doggone well, you can't make that murder charge stick. (warden) 'Knock off that crap, Hook.' Now, listen to me. This is a modern prison. Your civil rights will be protected to the full extent of our capability. (warden) 'Well, goddamn it. I've got 5,000 men out there.' And this facility was designed for 1,200. - You figure it out. - I have, Mr. Warden. If the Syndicate wants my ass there ain't shit you can do. Is that right? (male #3) Million and a half dollars. A man could flash on that, couldn't he, Hook? Depends on the man, sir. Worth takin' a chance for? Well, you sit on it. (male #3) The FBI'll keep right on lookin'. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. (warden) Um, he'll come around. [machines whirring] [whirring continues] [muffled groaning] (guard #3) 'What're ya doin' there, Glover?' (Glover) Machine broke down here, Harry. You wanna fix it for me? (Harry) You know, I know nothing about machinery. (Glover) C'mon, Harry. I've seen you handle a knife and fork. Help! Ah-h! Acid! [door closes] Okay, nigger-lover. We're gonna give you the beauty treatment. (Glover) We're gonna turn you into a gen-u-wine jiggaboo like Macey. (inmate #2) The boss is wrong! I didn't tell Macey. (inmate #2) 'Glover!' The boss is wrong! I didn't tell Macey! (inmate #2) 'I didn't tell him anything! Glover!' 'GLOVER!' Well, I'll give Mr. Capiello your message. (inmate #2) 'No! No!' Glover, you're a goddamned animal! What animal? Harry, it was an accident. (Glover) 'He was one of ours.' Let's go now! [doors shutting] (guard #4) Alright, let's go! [indistinct jabbering] (inmate #3) 'Hey, man, is that a fish down there?' (inmate #4) 'Hi, bitch.' Welcome aboard! Hey, you got a big butt boy this time, huh? Yeah, but brother, you know. Jesus loves you. Jesus cares.. [jabbering continues] Stand back. (inmate #5) Hey, how you doin'? I wanna welcome you to the Presidential Suite. My name is Henry. My man, Macey right over here. What's happenin', fellas? Hey, come on, Macey. (Macey) Get off of Mr. Hook's bunk! (Macey) 'Bitch.' 'I had you slotted in here, Hook.' Think I wouldn't save a top spot for my man? Cost me quite a few zuzus, you dig? Well, I hope I can make it up to you, big brother. You know. You're kind of a smartass. Aren't ya, Hook? Good thing I like smartasses. Ain't it, Henry? Look, brother, say what you got to say, okay? Maybe he thinks I'm bullshittin', Henry. Dangerous place CPI. A lot of honkeys. Lotta jive-ass junkies, faggots. A lotta shit goin' down. You cannot make it in here by yourself. Brothers, they stick together and help each other. You know somethin', Macey. I get the impression that you can help me, y'know? But what I can't figure out is how can I help you? You just stay cool, Hook. Try it yo' way. Smartass way. - You'll figure it out. - Won't take too long neither. (Macey) 'Man doesn't get away with a million five in cash' 'unless he's smart. You've got a lot to lose.' Goddamn it, Mark, come on! [door closes] Where is he? [exhales deeply] Where is he? Assigned to the North Four, before I could take care of it. In the Jigabeo Hilton with Macey. I want him outta there. I want him isolated. 'Do I have to draw you a picture?' I told you I'll take care of it, didn't I? You're fuckin' a-right you'll take care of it. You're the Captain, aren't ya? [evil laughter] [machine buzzing] Let's get these blankets outta here now. (guard #5) 'Steiner!' [door closes] Carelessness causes accidents. You've heard that, ain't you? Very careless of you, gettin' your black ass in here. You better arrange a little accident for yourself, nigga. Get your nigger ass hauled outta here, quick. You're not very fuckin' bright, are you, Glover? You going around talkin' about nigger this and nigger that. Man, fuck nigger. What the hell are you talking about? (Hook) 'They've given you and Macey a line of shit, man.' Goin' around fuckin' each other playin' honky, playin' nigger. For what? To get your men cut up? 'To get 'em stomped and get 'em killed.' It's less trouble for the man, huh? Hey, wait a minute. Maybe you get paid for this shit, huh, Glover? [people laughing] (Glover) 'What's the matter with you?' Ain't you never heard a nigger talk big before? [Hook sighs] Gonna be a sick call for you tomorrow, Hook. One way or the other. (guard on microphone) 'Miss Williams.' 'Miss Bombra.' 'Prisoner, your visiting period is terminating.' Come here with your bad self. Come on, sit down, baby. - So how you been? You been-- - I'm fine, how you been? You know I'm gonna make it, baby. - Yeah, I know. I just miss ya. - I been worried about you. - But you're okay? - Yeah. I wanna talk to you. Have they been messin' with you? Well, the FBI came by the station but no problem. Well, what do they want? Just tryin' to find a new charge to hit you with. Same old shit. Give it back! Whatever the hell they're lookin' for, if you've got it. Hey, baby, now look, you gotta listen to me. You gotta believe in where my head is at now. 'Cause whatever goes down here I'm gonna leave here a different nigger! I do believe in you, Hook, but you got to level with me. No, that's the way it ain't gonna be. It's safer for you. And it's safer for me, too, babe. Okay, I'm sorry. Now look, sorry ain't gonna get it. You gotta trust me. I want you to go see Jackson Barney. - Jackson Barney? - Jackson Barney. That jive-time hustler! That's the last thing you need! But that's what I want you to do. (inmate #6) Hey, you oughta get that button fixed. (inmate #6) You check his crotch, officer? Very suspicious. (guard #6) Hook, Curtis X. (guard #7) Okay, Hook, keep your ass clean. [sighs] (inmate #7) How come you ain't crackin' for the struggle, brother? Right on. If muscles gonna make it. You'll be there without me. Better watch your step. There's something in the works. Don't ask me what, I dunno. Well, uh, how come I'm on your telephone line? [laughs] I just wanna save your ass. Especially your ass! Uh...you better take this. No, thank you. My ass is gonna have to take its own chances. Okay. Shoot yourself. [blues music] [music continues] Who's that? [speaks Italian] This is Watch Captain Stambell. 'Be alerted for any unusual activity in the parade'' (inmate #8) Macey! This ain't your thing, man. Hook! Hook! (Macey) 'Hook!' A-a-ah! (guard #8) Everybody, get back inside! [siren wailing] [wailing continues] Hey, Macey! (Glover) 'No hard feelings, huh? My man got cut.' Four to one and your boy gets cut. Hard to figure! Yeah, that is hard to figure, ain't it? Well, maybe there's somethin' goin' on you don't understand. I don't give a shit what's comin' down. Hook's mine. Understand? (guard on loudspeaker) 'We have you targeted. Return to your cells.' [indistinct bickering] Sit down, Hook. Okay, leave him. Doesn't make sense. Does it, Hook? Just one knife. Why would one-lone black attack four members of a white gang in the yard, even if he knew they were unarmed? And the last time those four went out unarmed was when they came out of their mothers' womb. Then again, if they did attack you the knife ended up in the wrong back. Just doesn't make sense. [snaps finger] You know what I think? Somebody set you up. A man smart like you must have some ideas. You've gone to a lotta trouble for nothin', Captain. You're right! You're absolutely right. I set you up. All that bread disappeared. The Syndicate wants its money back. There's a contract out on you, man! You're scarin' the wrong nigger, Captain. Y'know, I came here to be rehabilitated and to find a useful trade, y'know. I'm your friend. Don't outsmart yourself. You're gonna need a friend before you're through. Well, I appreciate your offer of friendship, Captain. 'You'll appreciate it a helluva lot more before I'm through.' 'That's just to remind you' 'that Captain Otis T. Stambell is your friend.' (male #4) I was cruisin' down the street, I caught this little 'ol fag. Turned out to be nothin' but sport though, man. But I had a ball. You should've seen him, nigga. [indistinct chattering] Pistachio Lime Green. You gonna be the first on your block. Honey, I am the first. Now, where's Jackson Barney? - Right through there. - Thank you. (male #5) Yes, indeed. (male #5) 'You ain't the first mama and you won't be the last.' [indistinct chattering] - 'Hey, like your ass, brother'' - 'Have mercy!' Charles, it's Rena? Are you alone? [girl chuckling] (Rena) 'When am I coming to play doggie?' I've gotta take a little run over to China in a few days. I don't wanna go to China. Well, you're goin' whether you wanna go or not. You been beggin' me for my body. This is your chance to get it on Chinese soil. (Rena) It'll be so much fun. - Yes? - I wanna see Barney. (Barney) 'Let her in, Roger. She's a friend of a friend.' (female #1) You're next, Cherie. Well, Miss Danielle, have a seat. Thank you. (Barney) 'Now, tell me about my friend, the Hook.' 'How's he doing in The Slams?' Not as well as you. Hook needs to see you. I'll take a run up one of these days. Be sure leave me your phone number. Perhaps we can run up together. 'It's more urgent than that.' I can see you're busy. Perhaps, I pin you down a day next week? (Barney) 'Hook doesn't need me.' He needs a good lawyer. A good, white Jewish lawyer. The best a million and a half dollars can buy. He needs your help with no strings attached. No strings attached? Look, who's that dude there on the monitor? - 'I don't know.' - 'He followed you up here.' You get your head together. I got some questions to ask you about that million five. - Get your hands off me, pimp. - Come on, baby. Pimp! If he's a pimp, what does that make us, girls? [all laughing] [phone ringing] Rotella, oh, yeah, 38. Three, eight maximum security. Fifth floor checks. That's it. Full count all correct. Oh, full count, Captain. We can go home. Sign here, Moreno. (Stambell) Get your men posted. (guard #9) 'Alright, now, I want you all there to get your butts' and yer elbows, and you get that skull bone, boy. Pretty Henry, how's it goin', pretty Henry? You really get your rocks off when I go through. I sure do Henry and I'll be riding there behind you, too. - I believe you. - You sure enough sweet. Macey, Macey, Macey! How's it going, Macey? 'How's the wife and kids? Ha, ha, ha.' Ha, ha, ha. Oh, I'm sorry. You ain't seen your wife and kids in two years. Hey, brother. Goddamn you, stink. Take two towels, man. Get your ass in there. Ha, ha, ha! And don't you guys drop that soap and bend over. Okay, go take your break now, Calvin. Ha, ha, ha! [dramatic music] [music continues] [indistinct commotion] [commotion continues] [whistling] C'mon, you honky suckers. Ah-h-h! (Macey) 'You next, Glover.' [commotion continues] That's cute, Macey. Cute. Mr. Capiello's gonna love it. [footsteps] [laughter] [door opens] (inmate #9) You and I are gonna celebrate, Hook. (Hook) Oh, yeah? Well, if we're gonna have a party I'm gonna search the guests. Starting with you. You know who I am? I don't give a shit. Face that wall. You too, Sambo. Wait a minute, baby. I'm gonna take you to school. (inmate #10) 'You gotta learn your lessons!' You tell your boy to do what he's told. 'Cause I don't wanna get shit on my shoes, kicking his ass. I'd like to see you two tangle. The champagne's gettin' warm. Zack. You gonna take the shit off this punk? It's alright. He ain't nothing but trouble. Do what the man says. I should kick his ass right now. Goddamn it! Who told you to think? Get up against the wall. (Hook) You better watch that thinking, Sambo. Is it good, huh? Huh? Alright, sit down. Come on, sit over there. Come on, sit down. Sit down. You simple-ass nigger. [laughing] Satisfied? This joint is just like the outside, Hook. 'Lots of different ways to do a job.' The warden has his way. I've got mine. I only drink with friends, man. Hey, let me teach this nigger some manners. Shit, he thinks he's so goddamn cool. - I can whip his ass-- - Goddamn it. Shut up! Shit, I'm only trying to do my damn job. You're really too much, Hook. You know that, don't you? Look, Capiello, you had me set up for this in the yard. (Hook) 'Now, what do you want here?' There's a dangerous situation here. Blacks against the whites, whites against the blacks. It's getting worse. It's bad. Bad for business. I want a man like you to give me some leverage with the brothers. You need a head nigger? Try him. Shit! I want you to work for me, Hook. I don't want you to work for anybody else. - What do you say? - Bullshit. - Sit down, brother. - Sit down, Zack. He's not gonna do anything. [chuckles] There's a contract out on you, Hook. And I've got it. The organization wants their money. Now, you listen to this, Capiello, and you listen right. I don't know where's the money. But I got some ideas. You kill me, that's the end of it 'for you and the organization.' I'm not planning on killing you. Just a little friendly persuasion. [jazz music] [doorbell rings] It's open. Come in. [music continues] (Stambell) Good morning. Sure is a beautiful day. I'm Captain Stambell of the California Penal Institution. I'd like to talk about Curtis Hook. Did Hook send you? No, but he's gonna be mighty glad I came. This is a beautiful apartment you got here. 'You know, that news casting must pay pretty good.' What do you want to tell me about, Hook? - I talk better sitting down. - Oh, well, sit. I'm just getting ready to make some breakfast. 'Mr. Hook is in as much trouble as a man can get in.' 'About a million and a half dollars worth.' There's no money. Just crap the police's trying to hang on him. Let's just suppose there is and Hook knows where it is. It ain't doin' him no good in The Slams. You're wastin' your breath, Captain. 'I could take that money, put a little bit here and there.' 'Clean his prison record. Expedite his parole.' He'll be at a halfway house getting weekend furloughs. You're crazy. There's no money. Wish you'd get it in your head. He's gonna tell you who it is. You're gonna convince him then. You little fox, you. How would he tell me when he don't know where it is? - It's time for you to go. - Look. (Stambell) 'Come back here. I wanna talk to you.' I'll make a deal he can live with, a three-way split. - You, him and me. - Nigger, please. What would the police say about you comin' here visiting prisoner's girlfriends. Well, let's find out. Operator, get me the police. There's a contract out on Hook. He needs all the protection he can get. I can help him. Police Department? Yeah, lemme speak to-- [laughs] You know, you and I would make a pretty good team. Let's discuss your split. [doorbell rings] Coming. Baxter. Federal Bureau of Investigation. I'd like to ask you a few questions, Miss Daniel. - Won't take but a minute. - Excuse me. I'll be back to talk to you about that insurance policy. See you...soon. How's it hanging, brother? This goddamn drain's plugged up again. Okay. Check the outlet. Let's go. [whistling] Mr. Capiello wants to keep it movin'. You gonna risk it with him here? Ah, don't worry about him. You're gonna take care of him. [door closes] A-a-ah! Now. [both grunting] [both groaning] Hook! Ah! [groans] [tins clattering] Get him, Hooker. Nail him! Get him, Hooker! (inmate #1) Lay it on him. That's it. 'Hooker, Hooker.' [Hook gasping] Glover, guards. [panting] What in the hell is goin' on here? I got some...bleach in my eyes, man. I-I was just tryin' to help him. Get it out. Get him to the dispensary. Hook, let's go see the Captain. Ah. (male #6) 'Report directly to him rather than..' That Watergate affair a million buck payoff. If I had that kinda dough, I'd open a massage parlor. Make jerkin' off pay. [all laughing] Next. (man on TV) 'The famous old Pacific Ocean Amusement Park.' 'Our reporter, Iris Daniel, was on the scene' 'at the beginning of the end of an era.' (female on TV) 'At today's..' Right, next. (female on TV) 'Pickets vowed to fight to the end' 'against what they call the mayor's official vandalism'' 'The mayor swung..' What the hell you need? A goddamn invitation? (female on TV) 'Amusement park is an accomplished fact..' Something, uh, interesting on television? (female on TV) 'Destructive demolition or progressive civic planning.' 'Certainly another episode in the environmental battle' 'raging up and down California's coastline.' 'This is Iris Daniel, KSTV..' (male #7) 'They're only tearing down the old amusement pier.' (male #7) 'You'll never miss it.' (man on TV) 'Remember going there when I was in high school.' 'Now for some news..' - Sit down, Hook. - No. I don't wanna sit down. Okay. Let's see. Unauthorized work stoppage. Fighting with a prisoner. You look like hell. You got something to say, say it, okay? Capiello wants you back down in the laundry with Glover. You're gonna get your black ass integrated. And Glover's gonna be pissin' blood for a week too. And you gonna piss blood for the next five years. If you make it that long. Tell you what I'll do for you. I'll get you another job. 'Move you in with Macey for safekeeping.' Yeah, and play both ends against the middle? Capiello is not gonna like that talk from his house nigger. 'Man, you got the wrong end of the stick. That Dago is mine.' 'Sure, I mean, he pays me good for a few privileges.' Yeah, like movin' smack through the laundry? That's small shit for the kinda money I'm talkin' about. I'll cut off Capiello's water just like that. 'I know what's botherin' you.' 'You're missin' that pussy of yours, ain't ya?' Hey, I don't play that shit now. Slow your roll, home boy. Slow your roll. Look, I can make you a trustee. Move you to the farm in six months. In a year, you're back on the streets back in the old groove. 'Oh, I thought you were smart, Hook.' 'We could split the money, 50-50.' 'That foxy broad of yours she can make all arrangements.' 'You trust her, don't you?' You know, you got everything figured out now. You got everything figured out except one thing. Yeah, what's that? If I knew where that money was, I wouldn't tell a knock-kneed fat-assed faggot like you. Jive-ass. Remember, Hook. It's a long race, man. Don't bet your money on a short horse. (male #8) Come on, what do you guys say? Come on, come on. Let's go, move on. Damn it. Let's go. Come on, let's go. (male #8) 'Move on, let's go.' 'Come on. What's at it, big man?' 'Don't sit down, man.' [laughing] I said, don't sit down. Hey, man, just pretend I'm not here. Don't worry yourself. I want to see Capiello. You had your chance. You have to wait your turn. Hey, man, who are you? You workin' for Capiello? Or are you in business for yourself? - 'Now, I want to see the man.' - 'Wanting ain't getting.' Like, look, you tell me. Maybe I'll deliver the mail. [commotion] [inmates murmuring] Hey, brother, you know about the mail, don't you? Slow. Look, Hook, you got a long way to go. Glover ain't even begun on your case yet. And I ain't even started. You dig it? Look, brother, don't strain yourself here. Because you can have me any time you want. But now, you tell your boss that I gotta see him right away or I'm gonna make other arrangements. They needed a chef in this place. It's after lockup. You clowns are supposed to be in your cells. You heard what the man said. I don't need your blessings. Get your asses out. You need a rest, Captain. You oughta take yourself a little vacation in Vegas. 'Be my guest.' Shit! There's hotter action than Vegas, right here. You're getting paid well, Stambell. Hook is none of your business. I'm makin' him my business. 10%, 150,000. I'll go to Vegas on my own. I'll tell you what I'll do. This is my best offer. I don't bargain. Take it or leave it. You turn around and get your big black ass outta here and I'll forget what you just said. Who do you think you are? That's right, you WOPs. You wanna run the world, don't you? - Yeah, we do. - You think you're God, huh? Lemme tell you somethin'. I run this world, I'm God here. Look, with one word your life.. - This beautiful wine. - ...will come to speeding halt. - This is beautiful-- - I'll put you in a padded cell. Do something for your blood-- I've got you for the next three years, you hear me? You black, son of a bitch! You listen to me. You think I'm some punk asshole you can push around? Ten percent. For that money, I could have you replaced with a white man. Think that one over. You think this over. You got exactly 100% of nothing so far. - What? - Cool it. [inmate screaming] [continues screaming] (male #9) 'Help the man, somebody. Help him.' [moaning in pain] Got a message for you, Hook. Mr. Capiello is gonna see you tonight. Yeah, but why don't you guys do something about him, man? I wouldn't worry about him. Hook, I'd worry about-- [shouting] Why don't you do something about him? [moaning continues] [music on TV] This shit gets worse every year since they dropped the untouchables. You wanna see me, Hook? Yeah, but how come the Little Black Sambo ain't around to protect you? 'Cause I wanna talk to you about what your man Glover laid on me in the laundry. I heard you wiped his ass for him. I won't hold it against you, Hook. Thanks a lot. I'll put that on your account 'cause we got some business. - Oh? - Yeah. I know where the money is. All of it. - One million five. - Where? I'm not gonna tell you where. That's my ass, isn't it? - The question is how? - How, what? How you gonna get me outta here? So, I can deliver the money. [laughing] I'm way ahead of you, Hook. I figured that might be your price. Yeah, I figured that you would figure. Now you figure this. My take is gonna be one-third. You can take the million and I'll keep the five. I'll be a son of a bitch. You're beautiful, Hook. I'm going to regret losing you. It has to happen quick. We gotta get movin' fast or we'll lose the dough. The operation takes a week. The wall in the utility yard is not too high for a guy with the right equipment. Padded grappling hook and thirty foot of rope. Glover can get the hook made up for me in the machine shop. Yeah, he'd like that, wouldn't he? Hooks for Hook. Night count is the only time. Guards come off the search lights for the head count. That leaves just one guard in each tower till they finish the count. The only lights are the overheads on the walls. I figure you've got about ten minutes. No, no, no. That's not enough time. But once I miss night call Stambell's gonna have everything he's got on that wall and I'm still inside. Unless he thinks you've already made it. Then it's a matter for the State Police. When they stand down on the wall, you go over. Let's go, Hook. I'm goin' on my break. Sorry, Mr. Capiello. That's okay, Mark. I'll deliver Mr. Hook. You and Capiello are gettin' pretty tight, huh? Just remember, Hook, when the squeeze starts we'll see who has who by the balls. Come on, punk. - Hey, you're blockin' my car. - Get in. We'll talk on the way. Whatever way you goin' I'm goin' the other way. That's too bad. Brother Hook will be disappointed. Meaning what? Meaning he's got to see us right away. - Wanna little blow? - No, thanks. Look, Hook and I have been up and down for a long time. How come all of a sudden you're his long lost friend? You wouldn't believe it if I told you. But he risked his life to save my ass. You're right. I don't believe it. Asses must've been cheap in those days. [laughing] Speak for yourself, my dear. But believe me, it was the bottom line. And Hook's name was written all over it. Uh-hmm. - Where's Hook? - Number four. - How you doing, old buddy? - Okay. - How'd you like to take a ride? - I ain't goin' nowhere. Here's a bus ticket. Don't like buses, too uncomfortable. Oh, yeah? Take a plane. [no audio] - How you doing, baby? - How are you doing? I'm fine. Hey, my man! Well, what you know, my man? Just beautiful seeing you again. - Gimme a second, okay? - Okay. I see you took care of the guard. (Baxter) Always tryin' to make life a little sweeter for my friends. You look a little over drained, Hook. Don't worry. As soon as they find what they're lookin' for everybody will lighten up on your case. You'll do a year at the most. Hey, Barney, man, I can't beat that way. Look, I've got the money. And I'm coming outta here now. Jesus Christ! (Baxter) You're takin' a helluva chance. I'll take care of your money. Trust me. It'll be here when you get back. Now, you know I trust you, baby. That's why you're comi'' in here to get me out. Who me? My man, you certainly go first class. That's not the thing. I got a surprise for you. It's gotta be tomorrow night. - Tomorrow night? - That's right. You see, no rehearsals, man. Nothing changes, huh? Right, Barney? Yeah, except my ass is gettin' older. You don't escape out of a place like this. I'm not gonna escape. I'm gonna disappear. - How you gonna do that? - I'll show you what I mean. With this. It's all there. Everything. And Barney...we're gonna split it right down the middle. Yeah. Ten years of peace! [both laughing] (guard #10) 'Time's up, Hook. Let's go. Let's go!' [whistling] (guard #10) Alright, all you monkeys, hit it! He might break free! Get away! Glover! DM 4333. DM 4333. You know him, Glover? Oh! - Why're you asking me, Mario? - Oh, I dunno. Oh! [gasping] Mr. Capiello ain't gonna like this. He's outta business and so are you. Ah! Get him to the dispensary. Where the hell is DM 4333? [inmates chattering] [door opens] (inmate #11) 'Chico! Flush it!' Hit it! Hit it, you pervert! Give it away. Look at this. You a rich motherfucker, huh? - Who gave you this? - My grandmother gave me. Okay, man, get outta here! Alright, back to your cages, monkeys! They want bananas, huh? And 14 bottles of, uh, Rectal. Rectal? [both laughing] Take care of him. Oh, yeah. Sure. We'll take care. (Macey) Let's put him up here, Henry. We'll take care of him. We're the caretakers of this place, ain't we, Macey? (Rotella) Call the hospital after, you understand? (Macey) Yes, Sergeant, we understand. So long. So long, Mario. [breathing heavily] (Henry) Tell me something, brother. Would you like your aspirin now, or would you like it later? [breathing heavily] Stick it, Henry. Say what? Take it yourself. Might screw up your complexion. (Henry) 'You wanna go and open up that man's wounds like that?' (Macey) 'Let's take him over there and wash him off.' 'Come on, get up, you big honky!' - Get up! Move! - Hold on! (Macey) Take it easy, Henry! (Henry) Look, he needs help, man! [gasping] It's good for everything that heals. Take a good long drink of water. Call the hospital, Henry. This gentleman appears to have had a bad accident. Can you give me the night classes, Mr. Capiello? - It's important? - Very important. I'll take care of it. - Okay. - Don't worry. 'Alright.' See you later. Hey, they shot at the family. They knocked over three or four of Glover's punks. They got the laundry too. So, Stambell wants to play games, huh? - Surprise! - Oh, shit! You use this truck in your work? Turning tricks for Jackson? I'm not one of Barney's bimbos. I wanna hear about your visit. - What he said, you said. - I'm sick. - I can have Hook in the hole. - What? Solitary confinement, the hole. You won't see him for 3 months. I knew that'd make your antenna stand. I'll give you $500,000 for yourself. And Mr. Hook will be very grateful. That's really very nice, but I don't need your company. - Well, I need yours! - Hey, leave me alone! (Stambell) You are a feisty bitch, aren't you? Come over here, woman! You either cooperate with me or I'll have your boyfriend in a padded cell and see that he rots. Bitch! (Stambell) You're gonna wait for big daddy, huh? Hey, make it easy on yourself. (Iris) Ah. Ah. Ah. [tires screeching] - How ya doing, huh? - Good. How ya been? Okay, Jerry. How's the old lady? - Pretty good. - Looking good. - Should I unload this stuff? - Yeah, take it in. (male #10) 'Alright.' (guard #10) 'Alright. Open the door.' 'State your name as you come by me.' 'Alright.' - It's Chavez. - Chavez? - Para. - Para? Move on. - Mine is Abe, right there. - What's your name? - Abraham. - Okay. - Johnson. - Johnson? - I seen that guy somewhere. - Johnson? Time for lunch, huh? (guard #10) 'Alright, what's your hurry, huh?' Damn new clutch. Jumpy, just like my old lady. What you say, old buddy? There we go. Simmons, Carl. That's me. I got the John on the list, but I ain't got your name. I don't know nothing about that. I was just told to bring in the crapper. They're supposed to let us know about personnel changes. [laughs] No skin off my ass, man. I get paid by the hour. They'll have to crap in their hats! All clear up here, Dave. Alright, alright, take it in, Simmons Carl. Okay. I'll do that. You better tell that dispatcher of yours to get on the stick or I'll stop letting you guys through. Shit, take a stick to get that son of a bitch off my ass. Up yours, buddy, up yours. [train rumbling] You gonna let this come down like it's comin'? We ain't gonna be able to do anything if Macey takes over. - You gettin' worried, Zack? - You goddamn right! (Capiello) 'It's not gone that far.' Stambell thinks he's cracking, but he'll quiet down when he reads the numbers at the bottom of the page. Macey ain't gonna get him the 40 acres and that Cadillac. (guard #11) Pardon me, Mr. Capiello. Captain Stambell would like to have a word with you. Okay. Take care of the wine, boys. Save some for Papa. I'll keep the door open. [speaking in Spanish] Didn't I tell you no speaking Spanish around here? You speak English, if you wanna stay on this job. You want it in English? Bullshit! Get to work, Fuzzy. Who told you to put it here? We gotta use this area. I got six tons of cement blocks coming in. I gotta have a three foot clearance around this crapper. Or you'll have six tons of public health officials flying around your ass. Now, I don't give a shit myself. Hell, I can use the bar on the corner. Yeah, right. Sucker! Well, I went by your house yesterday and your little boy looked just like me, man. Even called me daddy. You've got yourself a problem. [laughing] Get in, Macey. [sniggering] I'm gonna have me a ball. (Stambell) 'I've waited for this for a long time, Hook.' 'Would you believe we used to call this old man' '"The Enforcer."' 'Never used any weapons.' 'Just his bare hands.' [tin clattering] [pounding] [bottle smashing] [rattling] [glass shattering] [pounding] [rattling] (Stambell) 'Kill him!' Uh, uh, uh. I've seen everything now. Beating up on white folks. Your wife is gonna be pleased to hear this. You can write your own ticket now, Hook. You got the balls to run these cons. You got the wrong boy, Stambell. Look, for a while they forgot who's running this prison. But you're too smart for that crap. Besides, there ain't nobody left for you to deal with, but me. Now look, I've made my point. Now you make yours. I'll talk to you tonight. Go in, get on back to work. [cell gate closes] [whistling] Gonna get some dirt for the Captain's plants. (guard #12) 'What?' I said I'm gonna get some dirt for the Captain's plants. Is that alright? Well, don't get too close to the wall. 'Cause I ain't shot anybody since yesterday. Yeah, yeah, yeah. [indistinct chatter] [whistling] How ya doin', bro? 'Bout finished. Here comes one of them petition cards. 'Rope and grapple inside.' You with the bucket. Does it take all day? 'Move on.' Okay, okay. It's only for the Captain, my man. (male #11) What's new, General? Where you want the shit house? You must be full of it. I got one trapper in already this mornin'. What a bummer! Man, they're gonna fire me for sure this time. - Oh, yeah? - I had another accident. This time a black chick cut me off at the intersection. - Okay. Right. - I had to go back to-- Put a clamp on it. Will ya? That dispatcher of yours must have his head up his ass. Now you tell him I said so. How rude. Take it up, Brian. You got anybody in the cab? Yeah, six or seven. You mean six or seven empties, right, Simmons? [laughing] Right. Okay, Simmons. Look, you tell that dispatcher of yours if he's got a spare crapper, he better use it himself. [laughing] Right on. 'Take it down, Brian.' [engine revving] [bell ringing] Come on, let's get our asses out. Unless you wanna spend the night. (guard on microphone) 'Three minutes to lockup.' 'All prisoners, proceed to their cell.' 'All prisoners, proceed to their cell.' [guards shouting] (guard on microphone) 'All prisoners, proceed to their cell.' 'Three minutes to lockup.' [intense music] (guard on microphone) 'All guards, proceed for the night count.' [music continues] (guard on microphone) 'Lockup is complete.' 'All guards, commence night count.' 316. 1-6. Hey, that's one short. Get on the recount. Ah, west 3. Those idiots, they don't know how to count. The Zoo's on west 3. Let's have that first. [dialing] [intense music] [music continues] [guard coughs] [sniffs] Cortez, Santiago R. Dishner, Robert H. Hook, Curtis X. - Where is that man? - No wonder where he-- - Where is he? - Where is he? Where is he? [phone ringing] (guard on microphone) 'All guards, report to your posts.' 'Emergency command received.' [prison sirens blaring] (Stambell) 'Night guards, on the walls. Day guards, on search duty.' - 'Alert the swing shift.' - Notify the LAPD and-- - Man, damn LAPD. - Yes, sir. Have them report to me, with floor plans and escape SOPs. Lock down until further notice. We're gonna keep him inside. Wait! Notify the towers and get a confirmation from each guard to shoot for takedown. I don't want mistakes. I want him alive. [sirens blaring] [jazz music] Please, may I have a taxi at the gas station at the corner of Oak and Calandrias? Thank you. Hey, Officer. Can I get outta here now? I've been in here a whole week. - 'Hey, this ain't Hook.' - Hey, listen, hey! Hey, Bob, get your ass down here! Where to, buddy? Oh, boy! Alright, just keep cool and you won't get hurt. Alright. Come on, let's do a little driving. Uh-uh, don't look back. Let your rearview down. Anything you say. You're the boss. - You mind if I throw the flag? - I don't care what you do. I don't keep much money in the cab at night. Just a couple of bucks in the cigar box. I been robbed before-- - Tough shit! - Yeah. About a year ago, a big colored guy. A negro fella. - A black fella-- - Shut up or I'll kill ya! Afro-American. - Gimme your matches. - Matches, matches, matches. Oh, boy. (male #12) 'Mind if I ask you a question?' (Barney) Yeah, I mind. Less you know, the better. (male #12) 'I won't ask.' - You see anybody? - I never saw anybody. - C'mon, man, think! - Might not be a prisoner. - You think it's a guard? - Somebody's helping him. - You know Michaelitis? - Michaelis, Michaelis-- - Over in North Four. - Get him down here! - Yes, sir. - He's got a radio. Broadcasts messages in my head. - Oh, shit. - Government code, top secret. The boiler room opens on the loading yard, by tower 3. We better send out the escape bulletin. - It goes out when I say so. - Shall we notify the warden? He's not back until tomorrow. We got time. Now come daylight, we're goi'' over that yard inch by inch. Hook's not goin' any place. [dramatic music] What does the meter read? Twenty five dollars and sixty cents. - I'm not gonna pay it. - I know. You're lucky to go. Keep drivin', don't look back. - Get it? - Got it. Good. [tires screeching] We lucked out. He was perfect. A nosey son of a bitch. - You think he noticed the van? - 'No way.' Stiffed him a $25 bill and left Hook's ID for a tip! [laughing] 'He'll be hot to trot, baby!' [laughing continues] (male #12) 'Hey, I don't care about any goddamn escape alert.' 'I had one of your convicts right in my cab.' 'Yeah. A $25 joy ride. That's what.' Hook. Hook, Curtis. Hey, but I ca-can't tell much. It's all burnt, but it says Hook. He had a gun. He was gonna shoot my ear off. That ain't nice. (guard #1) Let's go! Move it out! Come on, then shape up! Downstairs. Let's go. Move it out. Shape up. 'Get in line. C'mon, Nicole. Get over there.' Get moving. Okay! Shape up! Take off those glasses. Get that gut in. 'What are you laughing at? Shape up, men.' Sir! All present and accounted for. Okay, Sergeant. Move them out. Yes, sir. You heard the Captain. We're goin' over this yard with a fine tooth comb. You find anything, anything at all, you call me. I'll decide if you found anything. Okay, move it out. (Stambell) 'Move it! Move it! Check those concrete blocks.' 'There might be space inside. C'mon, move it. Move.' 'Michael, Kelly, Johnson, search this whole area.' 'There's no way a man can hide in there if we go quick.' 'There's a bonus for the man who finds him.' And check those damn vehicles. 'Come on, let's move. Move.' Look at these jackasses. Move. Calvin, check the trash for Hook. - I just got a manicure. - Hell with your damn manicure. Calvin, get in there right to the bottom. - It's nasty in there, Sergeant. - Get your ass in there, Calvin. Yes, sir. (Stambell) 'Alright, let's move it.' [metal clunking] [guard urinating] Oh. Bad-ass Sergeant.. [mumbling] Did you find anything, Calvin? Yeah. The rats say he went thata-way. That lazy son of a bitch! (Stambell) 'Did you find anything, Sergeant?' Yes, sir! No matter how hard you try the last few drops get on your shoes. Listen to that lousy alcoholic. Goddammit! Take over, Sergeant. I'll be back. Yes, sir. Keep an eye on him for me. (guard #1) Alright, men. Let's make another sweep to the left. Move it out. Let's go. Move! [guards bustling] There are basic procedures with which to handle a situation like that. Now you tell me, why did you not contact the police? Warden, he's still inside. He couldn't have escaped that easily. I've been chief guard at CPI for 11 years. And no one's escaped yet and Hook's not gonna be the first. I just received a phone call from LAPD intelligence. They informed me that a cab driver picked him up last night. What? H-h-how in the hell do they know it's him? Because his ID tag was in the back seat of the car. I look like a goddamn fool! We've got a man out. We don't even have a bulletin out on that man! - 'Warden.' - Shut up! There's no exception. - There's no excuse. - 'Yes, sir.' Are you listening to me? That thing with Hook that got outta hand. Yes, sir. I won't spend another dime on your bad judgment! Yes, sir. Warden, listen to me, please. Hook's still inside. Listen very carefully to me. This will not happen ever again. Yes, sir. The prison will get back to normal right now! Yes, sir! - Do you understand me? - Yes, sir! I hope to sweet-bleeding Jesus, you understand me? I'll have your ass! Get out of my office now! - Yes, sir. Yes, sir. - Move! - Yes, sir. - Get out! ' Yes, sir'' Three minutes to lock up. All prisoners, proceed to their cells. All prisoners, proceed to their cells. We're gonna start the night count, Cap. What's the matter with him? The warden took a big piece off his ass. Ah, he's just got the rag on. All guards, proceed with your night count. (guard on microphone) 'All guards, proceed with night count.' 'All guards, proceed with night count.' [jazz music] - Outta my way, you fat idiot! - Uh! Michaelitis says to say hello, Captain. (Stambell) He's gotta be out here! [music continues] [panting] [rattling] [breathing heavily] [creaking] [snap] [panting continues] [dramatic music] [creaking] [door creaks shut] [music continues] [faint splatter] [thud] [both grunting] Huh! Ah! [gasping] [panting] What's the matter, west 4? You're always last. Will ya get it on up there? Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna hold. [yawning] 824. Yeah, that's it. Make it a little faster next time, will ya? Yeah. (guard on microphone) 'Night count is complete. Night guards, proceed to posts'' [dramatic music] [music continues] [engine revving] (warden) 'No. Not rehabilitation, it's reeducation.' 'That exactly what we're doin' here.' We're changing their minds, see. (female #2) What about the security program you have here? (warden) 'We have a security game plan.' [cement mixer rumbling] This is gonna be a new kitchen. We fought hard for the Board to okay this. Sergeant Rotella watches his favorite program in the kitchen. Oh, we had nutritional problems. We had facility problems-- [reporter screams] Stop this, stop it! Oh, God! He had an accomplice. Somebody on the outside 'Got the clothes and the ID tag out to him.' Stambell was right. He didn't make it out after all. [speaking in foreign language] Monsieur. If you wish to reach Cannes by the morning we must depart very soon. [retro music] Darling, you're such an enigma. You tell me America is the land of opportunity but for the whites, Vraiment? Shh. You let them keep thinking that, darling because while they are making it we will be taking it. [laughing] [jazz music]
