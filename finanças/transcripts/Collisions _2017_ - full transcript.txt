Police, get down, get down. Get down on the ground. - No, no, no, don't shoot. Don't-- - Get down. Are you Yoana Bautista? - Yes. - Clear. - Don't move. - Clear. Clear. Clear. Yoana? Yoana. - Sir, outside. Stay there. Relax. That one. Yeah. - Yeah? You gonna show me that one? Up. And then, perfect right there. Oh! - Thank you. - Put the M and there you go. And how you say this word? - This one? - Yeah. Okay, good night, Neto. - I want another story. - Aye. - That I'm not wearing, ever. Can I go to the mall tonight? No. - Mom, you said I could. - I said you could go to Violet's. What's the difference? - It's a big difference. Who's gonna be in the mall? - I don't know, my friends. - Is there gonna be boys there? - Maybe. It's the mall. Why are you doing this to me? I'm not a little girl anymore. - You are a little girl. - I do everything around here. I'm the one that makes his lunch. I take him to school, I help him with his dumb homework, I wash him, put him to sleep. What do you do? - Can I have milk? - Shut up! Itan! - It's just the mall. Everyone else gets to go, besides me. I don't have time for this. - You never have time and you can take your dumb dress, too. - Go with your sister, it's okay. - Bye, Mom. Bye. - It's amazing what they've done. I'm so impressed with them. - Mom's never late for anything. I can wait. - No, it's okay. I'd better go get Neto. You sure? - Yeah. Mom? No, Neto, wait. - Why? - Just wait. Holy crap. There was three raids. Well, we have next of kin for all of the kids except for two. - Itan, is that it? - Yeah. - We have a hard time finding a family who can take two kids. Eventually we'll get you guys in the same house, maybe in a month. - You can't separate us. - Are you sure you don't have any other family? East-bound 80 still blocked at the interchange? Still blocked. - All right, here's another one for y'all. Damn it, driver. - You like that? Change the channel. Hey, Beaner, switch the damn channel. - Hey. - Do you live here? Are you Evencio Castillo? Can you turn that down? - What? I'm Ellen Hastings, Child Protective Services. - Yeah? Those aren't mine. You don't know who they are? This is Itan and Neto Bautista, your sister Yoana's children. - And? What are you writing down? Why haven't you seen your sister in six years? - I don't know. Why don't you ask her? - I can't ask her. I'm asking you. They let single moms out right away. She's only gonna be there for a night. I'm doing you guys a favor. How did you even find me? Hey. - Go away, runt. - Wake up, come on. The detention center opens in 30 minutes. Come on. - Okay, I'll be right there. One. Two. - We shoulda came without you. - You'd never find it. Three. - Can't be, it's not even marked. Why would they make it easy? Prompt and detailed reporting of suspicious activities can help prevent violent crimes or terrorist attacks. If you see suspicious activity, please report it to your local police department. Local law enforcement officers can respond quickly. - I'll probably never see you again. Bautista, Bautista. Yes, here we are. She left half an hour ago, transferred. - Call them, tell them to come back here. I'm sorry, we can't do that. - I'm supposed to be able to see my mom. Where is she? - Sometimes the records take awhile to update. - Look! - Hey, knock it off. We would've been here if you hadn't been drunk. - They would've transferred her anyway. - You don't think anything is your fault, do you? - What the fuck is that supposed to mean? Where are you guys transferring these days usually? It doesn't say. - Can you check what the bail is please? No bail. - Thanks. - No bail's good, right? - Did your mom ever get arrested? - She never even jaywalks. I mean she must've done something - shoplifting, fake ID. - Shoplifting, 12 years ago. - For what? Baby formula for me. - Great, you get mandatory detention for that. So we can't bail her out. That's what no bail means. - They deport 'em fast, like in a week. - I'm American. So is Neto. Our whole life is here. I'm gonna stop them from deporting her. - Maybe we have a small chance. You're going to need some money. - We have $3,642. - Why don't you just hold onto that for now. We gotta find her so that she can fill out one of these forms which says I am her counsel. - What's that a G-28? - How did you know that? - It's in your pamphlet. Do you have a list of detention centers? - There are like 700. Some of them aren't even listed. They're in office buildings, parking lots. No phone numbers, nothing. - Where is Uncle Evencio? - He must have something important to do. - Are we gonna live with him? - No. I need to call my children. - Fill this out. - What is this? - Phone card application. - But I don't have any money. - Are you okay? I have asthma. I need an inhaler. I need to talk to my daughter. - This way. - See if you can find her an inhaler. - This way, ma'am. - But... - We'll get some milk after school, okay? To speak to the supervisor of the Mississippi County Detention Center, please press nine. There is an error in the phone system. Please try your call again later. - Itan. I couldn't get ahold of your uncle. I left a message. - Oh yeah, he had to do some stuff but he's gonna be back soon. I programmed it to look for my mom. Wow. - Oh, I'll just put this away. Here let me help. - Thanks. Are you guys doing okay? - Yeah. Sean, what is the planet with the big red spot? - Jupiter. Very good. Which planet has the most rings? Saturn. Good job. - I want some. - Eat your eggs. Don't know how to pick up a phone? - Where's my beer? And what did you do to my place? - There's something seriously wrong with you. Something could've happened. - You're more than welcome to go back to CPS. I can see why Mom gave up on you. Mmm hmm. What's this say? - Oh my God. We found her. Look! We gotta go. - I'm not going to Phoenix. - You have to. - Has little Miss Princess been drinking? - Fine. Just take us to the bus station. I wish. Minors can't travel solo. Trust me, I've tried. - Can you just take us to Mom? This is your chance to be a big hero. I'll pay you. - How much? - $500. - Won't even cover fuel. - A thousand. Wanna try this? - Yeah. - Come on. Hup. All right, stay up here. - Why are we taking this? - In case I find some work. Push it all the way. All right. You know who that is, right? - San something. - It's San Setepec, the patron saint of our village in Oaxaca. - What's Oaxaca? - It's where your grandma lives. - Do you go there? - No. - You're waiting for your green card just like Mom. - No. I got my green card, long time ago. - He's ashamed to go back. - You don't know anything about me. - It's obvious. What's wrong? - The brake's a little mushy. - Mushy? Can I drive your truck sometime? - This music sucks. - What? This song's a classic. See, he likes it. Come here, Runt. Hup. Come on. Come here. - I don't dance. - What? To dance is to live, right Runt? His name is Neto. - What's she studying for anyway? She's always studying. - She's always studying. I never study. - Why does that not surprise me? It's the SSAT. - What? - SSAT. I'm trying to get into the Academy of Science High School. - Okay. When's the test? - In five days. Look, I'm trying to study. - We won't be back by then. - I found a test center in Phoenix. Of course you did. - What is that thing? - It's called a turtle. - Can I try it? - This'll make things a little easier. - Do you even know how to do this? - Come here, need your help. - He's gonna hurt himself. - All right, you ready? One, two, three. Oh man, oh, you're strong, dude. Woo! Boom. Strong. Hmm. - How many deportations has he stopped? - Who? - Your friend, the lawyer guy. - I don't know. Every time he does he has a killer party at his house. - Okay, so how long have you known him? - 10 years. - And how many parties has he had? Come on, how many? - Three. I'm sorry, the number you're trying to call is a cell phone. You cannot call cell phones from this phone. - Come on! Code 326. This phone system is not able to connect to answering services -- Okay, folks, that's it for today. Ladies, back to the cell please. - No, I'm not going, sir. Sir, I need to talk to my children now. Look, just leave her alone. - Sir, I need to talk to my children. I haven't talked to them-- - One minute, just one minute. - Let me just talk, sir. I haven't been able, I'm not going. Sir, please, please. Just gimme, just two minutes. Please. Please. Sir, please just one, let me out, sir. Listen... We're not sleeping here. - Cool. - Suit yourself. - Don't look. Uncle Evencio. - Close it! Amazing. - Can you sleep with me? No. - Good. Is Mom dead? What did you say? - Is Mom dead? - Why would you say that? - Why doesn't she call us? - Maybe she's somewhere where she can't talk. - Maybe she doesn't like us anymore. - No, Neto. She's gonna call us very soon, okay? - I want Mom to read me a story. - Neto, I'll read you a story later, okay? - I want Mom to read me a story right now. I was in prison once. - Really? - Yeah. You know what else? I used to read stories to your mom when I was your age. She didn't know how to read. She never went to school so she used to like me to read for her. - Do you know her? - Yeah. Dumb dumb. She's my sister. Just like Itan is to you. She bugged me. She used to do this to me. - Ow. She didn't do that to you? - No. - Well, you're lucky. Go to sleep. - Good night, Neto. Hey. Hey. - Aren't you gonna ask me in? - Do you have like friends? - Of course I do, hundreds. You mean like would anybody care if I died? - Don't. Don't! - What happened? - You're such a jerk. So would they? Would they what? - Would anyone care? - Probably not. - Oh, your life is so hard. Your funeral would be awesome. - Yeah, probably. Be a bunch of people getting drunk. - And singing really loud. - Be lots of singing. Would you sing for me, buddy? - Yeah. Yeah? - Yeah. What would you sing? - I don't know. ♪ Uncle Evencio is dead ♪ He had such a hard life ♪ Such a hard life ♪ He drived a big old truck ♪ But now he can't 'cause he's dead ♪ ♪ He's dead ♪ Dead, dead, dead ♪ Dead da dead - When can I drive your truck? When can I drive your truck? - Stop jumping, buddy. Lay down. What's that say? - What's a lot lizard? - It's been a long drive. Let's get a hotel room. Pa, pa, koo, ooh, ow. If Mom goes to Mexico, can we live with you? What? - If Mom goes to Mexico, can we live with you? - No. Don't be stupid. You don't wanna live with me. What? You guys hungry? - Yeah. Come on, Neto. - It's about Oaxaca, isn't it? Yeah. - Can I have some pie? Okay. - Come on, let's dance. Come on. I told you I don't dance. - Just follow me. Stay here. Hey. What do you think you're doing? - Not doing-- - If you don't get the fuck outta here I'm gonna knock your teeth in the back of your throat. - Easy. Get the fuck outta here. - All right. - Hey, buddy, come on let's go. Come on. Still want some pie? - Yeah. - Okay, stay here. - I need to work on my petition. Neto, let's go. No! - Neto. No! - He can stay with me. I'll take him up in a few minutes. - A few minutes. - A few minutes. Ah, water. Then what happened? - Uncle Evencio. - We end up getting to where we're getting. And the ... Neto? Hey. What are you doing out here? I said a couple minutes. What happened? What? - What happened? - Nothing, hey, look. You dropped-- - Where is he? - He ran off. - From where? The restaurant. - Which direction? - This way. - How long has he been gone for? - 10 minutes. - 10 minutes! Oh my God. Neto. Neto. Neto. Help me! - I'm looking. Put him down and get out. Put him down! He's sleeping. I'm sleeping. - Jesus. Get out, get out! God, you're exhausting. - No, you get out. Come on, get up and out. - Neto's fine. Go to bed. - What if something would've happened? - Don't yell at him! - Neto, do you know why we don't have a dad? - Knock it off. - You know he went to Mexico for a funeral, right? - Itan, stop! - Uncle Evencio was supposed to help him come back. Dad didn't know the way through the desert. He needed Uncle Evencio to help him. But Uncle Evencio got drunk and he went with a dumb woman and didn't come back for two days, so Dad went on his own. - He was supposed to wait. - Dad went on his own and he died and it's Uncle Evencio's fault. - I don't need this. I don't need to be here. I'm doing you a favor. - A favor? Right, as long as I pay you. - You're just like your mom. - No, get out, get out! You guys stop! Stop it! Get out. You can go. - Cut it out! - Get out! - Stop! Itan, don't hurt him. Itan! - You're a spoiled brat. - We don't want you here anyways. You can leave. I'm sorry, Neto. - Leave me alone. I'm still hungry. What's that say? - "In custody" means Mom's in prison. If it changes to "not in custody" it means she's been deported. That's the only way we'll know. Hey, we have a hundred signatures already in our petition. And we have 300 likes on Instagram. I've never been so popular before. Hello, Evencio? Hello. - Who's this? - My name is Rosa Fuentes. Is Itan Bautista there? I have a message for her from her mother. - This is Itan. What did she say? Oh, she says to tell you that she loves you and Neto. She's in Bakersfield and I got moved again. - Wait, Bakersfield? She's in the Phoenix Detention Center, right? - No, no, mija. We were in Phoenix and then they transferred us to Bakersfield. - What's the address? - It's 1316 Central Street. But it's not marked. It's underground in a big parking lot. I'm sorry, I have to call my family now. I only have three minutes left on my card. I'm sorry, goodbye. - Where's the money? - I have some money. I have some money. - Will you just shut up? You don't have any money. Oh my God. Evencio. - So I'm dropping you with your aunt, right? - Yeah, in Bakersfield. - I don't usually take kids on their own. - Is that your daughter? Yeah. - She's really pretty. Thanks. Where are we? - Just be quiet for a second. - I have to go to the bathroom. - Hold it. Stop! Stop it! Oh my God. Set down your backpack, come on. Gonna lift you up, ready? Set, go. Can you see anything? Mom? What? You see Mom? Mom, Mom! - I can't see, what? - Hey! What are you guys doing in here? - Yoana Bautista. - One minute. - Alien registration number 088424581. - Right, yeah. Sunrise Motel. - Yeah, I stayed there last night, Evencio Castillo, room 202. I was there with two little kids. Yeah, yeah, they got a taxi. - What? When? Three hours ago? - Where'd they go? How would I know? - Shit. Who is it? - Nobody. Where's that van going? Another detention center? Mom! That's our mom. Stop the car. Sir, stop the car! There's nothing I can do. - Go back please. Where are they going? I don't know. - Oh my God, she's being deported. Sir, please go back. Stop the car, sir, go back! - Girl says her mom's getting on the van. Nothing we can do. - I'm sorry. - Please, sir. There's gotta be something else. You can't just stop the car for me please? Just go back please. Yoana Bautista removed to Tijuana. She got on the 8:45 transport. - Ah shit! Shit! Well, have you at least seen two little kids come through here? I don't know, sir, I just started my shift. - Well, can you look? Can you ask somebody? No patients by that name. - Okay you didn't check any kids without any names that maybe were unconscious or got in an accident or something? No, sir. - Are you sure? Can you just check for me please? No one like that. - We found a place for the boy. Still working on the girl. - What are you talking about? - He can't stay here. - No, you can't do that. - Hi. What's your name? - Neto. - Neto, my name is Mr. Edeleson. You're gonna come with me. - No! - He needs a real bed. - Hello? - Evencio? - Itan, is Neto okay? - Yeah. I'm so scared. - Uncle Evencio! - What? - SSAT test today. - Hello. I'm in Tijuana in a shelter. The phone number here is, you have to dial 011, then 52-55-501-3318. Please, please call me and let me know if you're okay. - Well, call her, call her. - We know where she's at. So you wanna hire a coyote to get your mom back across? I know a guy. - No, I don't want Mom to do anything dangerous. - Well, what do you wanna do? - Why are you pulling over? - I gotta pee. - There's a McDonald's up on the next exit. - Does this look like a Honda Civic to you? Do you wanna try parking this thing at McDonald's? - Oh. You're not gonna go? - Where are you going? We don't have time for this. We gotta go. Where are we going? Come on, Neto, let's go. - We were supposed to cross. Your dad and me. He hated the desert. Welcome to Mexico. Lotta people get stuck here trying to cross. That's the US right there. - Why don't people just jump the fence? - If they jump right here, they get caught right away. You wanna get across, you have to go somewhere hot. This is where they deport people. Your mom probably went through here. "The end"? - Hmm, that's funny. - No it's not. It is a little. - Why would it be? Go. Come. - Mom? Mom! - Itan. - I missed you, Mom. - I missed you, too. I miss you, too, so much. Don't ... - Where's that money I gave you? - I ain't got no money. You didn't give me no money. Yes I did. I ain't got no money. I ain't got no. You spend it? Yes. Maybe you should go back?
