"Dear sister, The famous Prince Zsbrschosky- by the way, a charming gentleman, and not without means - is giving a large ball to which we are invited. Please come. Get real pretty and act the same. If someone wants to kiss you, don't giggle. That's not chic. Your sister, Marie" "I'm already feeling a lot worse." "Can you forgive me?" "Never." "How about a new hat?" Von Reizenstein gets ready to serve time. "Expecting to see you at Zsbrschowsky's. Crowd will be colossal. Your friend Hugo." "If you follow me any further, I'll teach you a lesson." "That's exactly what I want." "Do you want to go to jail like that?" "You never know. They might be celebrating something there." "Just make yourself at home." The Warden "You are under arrest." "You will have to play my husband now, or you will compromise me." "As her husband, I'm allowed to do that." "And with me he is always so stingy." "Expecting to see you at Zsbrschowsky's. Crowd will be colossal. Your friend Hugo." "My wife has no idea. That shows how stupid women are." "Now the coast is clear."
