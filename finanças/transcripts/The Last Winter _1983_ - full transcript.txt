[PROJECTOR CLICKING, *...] [LOADING TAPE IN VCR] [CLICK] [MUSIC PLAYS ON TV] >> Woman on tape: Alaska. Vast wilderness of the north. Land of great natural beauty and diversity. This is rugged country. Land of black gold. Alaska's North Slope has been producing oil out of Prudhoe Bay since 1968, delivering to refineries and ports 800 miles to the south through the great Trans Alaskan Pipeline. But another northern region, known as the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, has remained untapped. Only once have prospectors gained access to this barren landscape. In 1986, KIC Corporation, a partnership between native and business interests, commissioned the drilling of a test well. The results of that drilling have been a carefully guarded secret ever since, with only a solitary white box marking the footprint where the rig once stood. Now, at last, after an historic vote in Congress, the KIC well will reveal her secrets, and North Industries will be there. Working in consort with environmental experts, North Industries will send advance teams to map the area and determine strategic drilling locations. Ice roads will be constructed to transport the rigs, and drill sites and pipelines will be operational within the decade. One step closer to energy independence. We have got the vision, the experience, the know-how. North Industries: Trust. Risk. Results.
