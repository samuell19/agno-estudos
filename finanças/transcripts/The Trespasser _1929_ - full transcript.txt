Yes, but shh, be quiet. Hurry up now. Ms. Donnell, you made a mistake here of over 10 million dollars. Oh... Well, a few million dollars, more or less. Mr. Ferguson, I should have told you before. but I've had such an exciting day. I'm leaving. Leaving? Yes, to get married. Married? Yes. When's the happy day? It's tonight. Tonight? Sounds like an elopement. It is. Who's the lucky boy? Well, if you don't mind, I'd rather not say. I see. I hope he's worthy of you. Chicago boy? Oh, yes. What's his business? Well, he hasn't exactly a business. He's somebody's son. How unusual. Well, I mean I mean, well, it's Jack Merrick. Merrick? John Merrick's boy? Yes. I see what you mean by "somebody's son." But he's going to work. You're marrying money. No, I'm marrying the man. He's the son of one of the really big fortunes. That doesn't matter. He should work. Every man should work. You work, Mr. Ferguson, and you're rich. Well, I'm rather a lonely old man. My work keeps me occupied. So you're off tonight. Yes. Crazy kid. It's serious. Marriage is a serious step for a woman. I'm not afraid. Young love seldom is afraid. Well I'll finish these. No, no, no. never mind. I'm sorry this is so sudden. Well, this sort of thing usually is sudden. Sure I can't correct my mistakes? No, no. Oh, thanks. Goodbye. Goodbye. We'll miss you. Thank you. Goodbye and good luck. Thank you, Mr. Ferguson. Goodbye! Let's get out of here! Of course I'm going to get out of here! Wait, I have to put everything in order ... Now wait a minute, I have to put this here ... Oh, here, I'm the man of the family and I'll put that down. Well, maybe that's the last time I ever see that ... What are you.. don't take those flowers out of there! Goodbye, old friend ... Come on, hurry up. Will you get out of here? Oh wait a minute, where's my purse? Alright, now come on. Do you think I've got everything? Hurry up. I wonder if I've forgot something ... Do you love me? I adore you! Come on... Will you get out of here? You've got a date with a very important guy. I see you. Darling! Yes? Good morning, Mrs. Merrick. Good morning, Mr. Merrick. Oh, look at that lake. Yeah. Do you know where we ought to be now? Just where we are. In the sunny south of France. The sunny south of France? You know, motor down from Paris ... to the south of France. Get on the yacht at Marseille. And then all the way down the Mediterranean to Algiers. I mean a real honeymoon. But, darling. Isn't this a real honeymoon? Of course it is. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. Happy? Happy? Oh, you broke ... Say Jack, you better fix that. Oh, let the hotel fix it. No, you fix it. Why? Well, if you don't know why ... Hey, will you cut that out? Stop that, will you... The phone is ringing. Let me answer that phone. Hello? Hey! Hello? Speaking. What? Well tell him I'll be right down. I didn't say send him up. Was it Mr. Merrick? Are you sure it was Mr. Merrick? Well, anybody with him? Oh, heck! I love you truly... ...truly. Hey, pipe down! Why? It has arrived. The breakfast? No, Dad. Why, where? He's coming up now. His lawyer is with him. Oh, the great big bogeyman! Now, this is no joke. Now we get some fireworks. Now the trouble starts. Troubles? What do you mean, troubles? What makes you so nervous, Jack? You don't know Dad. Well, darling, if that's he's gonna make me look like that, I don't want to. This is serious. You realize what we've done, don't you? What? Well, we, we eloped. We ran away. We got married. We've got a fight on our hands. Oh, darling, we're two to one. We can fight the world. But I wouldn't want to fight Dad. I'm his only son. I'm the only thing he's got. You're my husband and you're the only thing I've got. Yes, I know. Now, you better get dressed. I'll go on in. I know Dad. You can't keep him waiting. Hello Dad. You young fool, I ought to take you and break your neck. Why, Dad? What have you done? I've married a marvelous girl. Did you have to marry her? Now, get that out of your mind. She's as straight as a die. Were you drunk? No! Well, who is she? And who are her people? Her people? Well, well I've never asked her, Dad. To hear you talk, anyone would think I picked her up. As a matter of fact, Marion is a charming, decent girl who happens to work for a living. How does she earn her living? She was a stenographer. A stenographer? But she'd stack up with any of the girls we know. Well, that being the case... Didn't it occur to you that I'd might like to have met the woman who's going to take our name? Yes, I thought of that. But to tell the truth, Dad, you're a bit of a snob. What? Well you are. Because she happened to work for a living, you'd have ritzed her and questioned her. And you couldn't do that to her. She's got too much spirit. So rather than take a chance at losing her, we ran away. I wanted to be sure of her. Well, she's made sure of you, alright. I'm glad she has! Well, Dad. I love her and she loves me. And we're married. What are you going to do about it? Do you realize what the papers are going to do about it? What the story will be? "Young Merrick elopes with stenographer in the middle of the night." Oh, Dad ... A dirty, filthy, rotten scandal. Now you listen to me. I am one of the biggest men in this country and you're my son. And as my son, you owe me your duty. And that duty is to live up decently to the name that I've worked all these years to give you. And now, now you're quitting! No, I'm not quitting! Yes you are quitting! You're tangled up with some woman of the town. One of the kind that follows kids like you around waiting for a chance to hook them. Something that you ought to bring down to a place like this at night. Some low-down, low-life, fortune-hunting parasite! Why I.. Marion! Jack, he was speaking about me? Yes, I was. Oh... Marion! Dead wise. Smart as a whip, too... Say... What are you going to do about it? I don't know! You don't know? Well what? Send him away. If you knew Dad, you'd know that if he went now in the mood he's in ... He'd never come back. You want him to come back? He called your wife a thing of the streets. Oh, he's just mad now. Mad? Well, you'll know Dad better. I don't want to know him any better. But we'll need him. Do you need him? I don't. Well, you're not going to bow out of 50 million dollars just because he lost his temper, are you? His temper? Why, he didn't mean it. He did mean it and I mean this. Not one penny of that man's money are you going to take. Now, you're just upset. Now when you think better of it ... No. You're going to work as we planned. And I'll work, too. Jack, let's keep our pride. But, honey ... I married you, not your father or his money. Now it's for you to choose. But Marion, I can't give up a fortune. I can give up my life. Go and send him away. Go out and send him away or I swear to you ... I'll leave you. I mean it. Okay. To show you how wrong you are about Marion, she just told me that if you had fifty times the money you have she wouldn't touch a penny of it. And that goes for me, too, Dad. I'm with her 100%. I love her and I'm going to work for her. We... We don't need you, Dad. Jack! Jack! Yes Dad? Come here, boy. Now suppose this is the right girl for you, suppose it is ... It is, Dad. Have you realized that they'll only say one thing about her? What's that? She'll be just the stenographer that Jack Merrick eloped with in the middle of the night. Well what's wrong with that? Oh it's all very well to be cocksure now. But you've got your lives before you. And you mark my words. The day will come ... when she'll resent, and rightly too, the implication that she caught you off guard. That she hooked you for your money. Well? Now suppose we call this a day? For now? Just what do you mean? I mean have the marriage annulled. Never! If you wanted to start this girl off right you'd let me have this marriage annulled quietly. Then, the impression would be that you never had been married. But that you had met a charming girl, you'd brought her down to see me, and I'd liked her. Now, do you get me? Not quite. Then after that, we'll see what she has in the way of a background. If nothing at all, well, a little publicity and we'll build one. But she doesn't need one. Oh now, wait a minute. You know how I do things. We'll buy her some clothes, we'll build her up gradually. She's a charming girl. Everybody seems fond of her. You propose to her, the engagement is announced, and everything is jade. Then for a happy courtship and after that, an honest to goodness slapbang wedding. That'll start you both off right and put you in the spot in this city that the name of Merrick entitltes you to. Now does that make sense? I see what you mean. It will be much better for the young lady in the long run, Jack. You must see that. Yes, yes, I see that. She's pretty touchy about the whole thing. It'll need handling. Good. That shows she's got spirit. Oh she's got that, alright. And it would be much better for her, wouldn't it? Why of course. And then Jack, a real honeymoon abroad. Say, what are the chances for getting the yacht on the Mediterranean? Anything you want. You know how I do things. Okay. Say now, wait a minute. You will be nice to her, won't you? Sure! Yeah. Yeah, yeah... Are you going through with that? You think I'm crazy? How do I know who she is? He's in love with her. Oh he's nothing but a kid. This woman swept him off his feet. When the time comes for him to marry ... he'll marry to Josh Carson's daughter and he'll like it. The young Carson girl, eh? Yeah, little Catherine Carson. She's a charming kid. Good family, good breeding. One of his own class. Why hang it all man, this kid's the only thing I've got. I don't think you'll break this thing without a fight. Well, we can fight, can't we? We've handled people before this, haven't we? Shhh. Let her start. Go on. Dad's thinking of you. It will be much better for you. What is this plan of your father's? Well, he thinks we should call it a day. Just for now. Call our marriage a day? We'd still be married. How could we if they annul it? Well don't you see? We'd be engaged all over again. I see, and in the meantime? Well, Dad would build you up with people. Build me up? I don't need building up. Well you want a position, don't you? I've got a position! I'm your wife. Well who said you weren't? You did! Well I'll back Dad's judgment. After all, he is somebody. His opinion counts for something. You're right, it does. It counts for you. What is your dad exactly? What do you think you all are? You want to call this thing a day? Alright, call it a day. I'm through! Why, Marion! Mr. Merrick! I married your son because I loved him and thought he loved me. I felt that if he worked on his own, I supposed it would make a man of him. I put him to the test and he failed. No, Marion! You came here to save your son from a fortune-hunting parasite. Well, you happen to have saved her instead! Annul the marriage! Take him back! I don't want him! Marion! Go back, your father is calling you! Marion! Jack! What seems the matter with baby this morning? He wants his milk. The milkman's late. So am I. Before you go, Ms. Donnell, I'd like to speak to you. There are some things to be gone over. I'm so late. You don't know that crowd on a morning like this. There'll be a crowd here if you don't get some of these bills paid. Ms. Donnell, you can't keep on evading them. I'm not evading anything. I simply haven't got the money, that's all. Somehow or other, we've got to pay Dr. Rigley. He's got to be paid. After all, you owe the baby's life to him. And I didn't tell you yesterday. But yesterday they came and took the sewing machine. The sewing machine? Four months behind on the payment. But I had the money for that. That money went to the central market. Surely they would have waited ... Is he alright? Of course he is. I'll go. Milk! Here's the baby's milk now. Is that the certified milk? Yup. Gotta collect. What? Gotta collect. What is he saying? Gotta collect. He says he's got to collect. Sixteen dollars and fifty cents? How's that? How long since you've been paid, young man? Don't know. These tradesmen are so impotent. Well I like that. I'm like the Mrs. Rockefeller the way she hands them to me. Come on, why don't you leave it? Step on it, will you? I'm late. I step on you! Here. Give her the change. So you gave him the twenty dollars. You didn't have to pay all that. Now you've given him the rent money and we'll be out on the street. The baby had to have his milk. I could have gone down to the corner and got it for fifty cents. Why didn't you say so? Now let me tell you something for your own good, Ms. Donnell. You get fifty dollars a week. After that, you pay me twenty when you pay me. That leaves you thirty to run everything. Food, clothes, rent and all this baby costs you. Oh, my angel. At night when I bring these things up, you've got a thick headache or you're tired ... and you say "in the morning." Then morning comes ... I must go, here ... Well I must go, too, Ms. Donnell. For good. Oh you, you couldn't ... And why couldn't I, pray? Because you've got to take care of him. He's never had anyone but you. Oh please sweet, let's talk about this tonight. Please. Oh, Ms. Donnell. You ain't in no fit condition to go out and do a day's work. I'm alright. Well your nerves ain't right. Mark my words, it's comin. Wha't coming? A breakdown, and then what will happen? Oh, why don't you do what you should have done long ago? What? Go to the baby's father. Let him help. No! Where's my umbrella? I left it in the bathtub. It makes puddles out there. I'll get it for you. What's the matter, Ms. Donnell? Telephone the office and say I'll be late. But what's the matter? Oh I'm alright, just a little faint. I'm perfectly alright. There's nothing the matter. Get me a cup of tea, will you? I told not to go out mornings without your tea. I'll get you a bit of toast, too. No, never mind the toast. Miss Potter. Yes? Come here. What is it? Look. "Welding of millions. Paris, France, November the fourth. John Merrick, Jr., only son of John Merrick, Chicago multi-millionaire, was this day married to ... Catherine "Flip" Carson, youngest daughter of Joshua P. Carson, of the Chicago Chemical Work The pair left immediately after the ceremony for an extended trip through the sunny south of France" ... Well, that's that. Where's my tea? That's him, ain't it? Well, the baby's grandfather is here, ain't he? According to the papers, he's a charitable sort of man. Very. Then you should go to him. Those Merricks owe that baby something. Oh, Ms. Donnell, it's your stubborn pride. You can be stubborn about yourself. That's one thing. But a young baby's another. Hello. Hello! Mr. Merrick senior, please. Mr. Merrick inside? He's waiting for you, Mr. Pry. You go right in. Any more news? No. While you're in there, tell Mr. Merrick that we're holding the wires on the train til the last minute. Alright. If my wife calls, tell her I'm going with him. Right. Hello? Hello. Mr. Merrick is leaving at once on the Twentieth Century. Have you arranged for the motorcycle escort to take him to the train? It's most urgent. Oh, you have arranged it. What's wrong with that Paris call? Oh, the delay is in New York, Mr. Merrick. Mr. Merrick! Not now, miss, please. Hello? Hello? Oh, Mr. Sullivan? Mr. Sullivan. Mr. Merrick says you may publish this cable, which is all he knows. Paris, France. Car overturned near Lyon. Chauffeur killed outright. Jack and Catherine in hospital in Lyon. Both unconscious. That's all, Mr. Sullivan. Take this wire. George Clark, Ritz Hotel, New York City. Jack badly injured. Leaving Twentieth Century. Obtain surgeon O'Leary if possible ... at any cost. Sailing Berengaria Friday night. Hello? Hello? Oh, Western Union? Just a moment please. 00:28:05,716 --> 00:28:08,416 Hello? Hello? What? Well what is it? What is it? No, it's something about Pittsburg. Come on, John, you haven't a minute to lose. Oh, Mr. Merrick. Mr. Merrick! You forgot these files. No. Mr. Ferguson is in a director's meeting. He's been tied up for hours. Twenty million of preferred stock. I'd have an issue with forty million ... and you're asking for a...? Just a minute. Will you compromise and accept 22.5? We'll compromise? Why what are you talking about? Young man, I've been in this business for 40 years ... and I won't be bulldozed. Gentlemen, gentlemen. We've got to postpone this until tomorrow. Now you all understand the main features of the agreement. Ms. Donnell has them in her notes. A copy will be mailed to you tomorrow. Remember the last time I met you in Chicago? Why sure, you were heavier than I. Hello? I can't hear you. Can you speak a little louder? Oh, I hear the word "Paris" ... Oh, I see. Yes, he's.. he's regained consciousness? Oh, fine, fine... Bring your notes, please. Yes. Alright, thank you. What's the matter with you, Ms. Donnell? What's the matter? Nothing. I watched you this afternoon at the meeting. You didn't take down any of the notes. Your mind was miles away. I'm sorry, Mr. Ferguson. Don't be sorry. Sit down and tell me all about it. There isn't anything to tell. Oh yes, there is. Now, sit down. You know, I've seen this coming on. What? A breakdown. A breakdown? Yes, why you haven't been yourself for weeks. Frankly, I'm worried about you. Is there anything so surprising in that? We've been associated for a long time. After all, I'm a friend. Now you better tell me what's troubling you. You've more important things than ... Nothing is more important to me. Now come on, what is it? Tell me all about it. It isn't any one thing. It's everything. Everything's all muddled together. I'm a failure. You're not a failure. Now what you need is a trip to the country. Out in the sunshine with that baby of yours. I can't. You can. And I'm going to see that you go. Why, if I saw a stranger in the state that you're in, I'd want to help. And you're much more than that to me. I've got... Marion! Fuller! Quickly! Yes. Yes. ... and the funniest part of it was he paid the bet. Just one drink and then you're going home. As beauty commands. Oh, I do gallant. Didn't they say that in the play tonight? Yes, don't you remember? Yes. And then he took her in his arms ... Remember? Yes, I remember. But you are not a brave guardsman. You're a very important lawyer. With lots to solve tomorrow. That sounds very dull, Marion. I'm not the romantic type, eh? You're the real type, Hector. You have brains, and kindness ... Everything except romance, eh? You saw how unhappily the romance ended in the play tonight. Sing one song. Oh, no I don't think... Just one song and then I'll go. Well, alright. If it pleases you. Are you happy, Marion? Of course I'm happy. Why do you ask? I sometimes wonder if you really are. What more could a girl ask to make her happy? You've given me so much. Too much. Oh that's impossible. As long as it's... As long as all that pleases you, I'm happy. You're very beautiful. I like to look nice for you. That's the least I can do. Marion, could you ever really love me? Hector, dear ... You, darling... you'll never know what a paradise you've made for me here. It's like a haven in a storm. Now, you're becoming the brave guardsman again. Good night. I love you. Oh, I wonder where my baby is? Jackie? Jackie! Jackie! I wonder where he can be. I wonder where he can be. There you are, my darling. Oh, my sweet! Oh my precious lamb. Goodnight, my sweetheart. Goodnight. Give me a nice kiss. That sweet kiss! Oh, precious. You know what day tomorrow is? Sunday! My day! My day! And we're going to the zoo. You know we're going to see the monkeys and the lions that roar and the wolves ... and all kinds of little animals. Won't that be fun? Now you go to sleep with pleasant dreams. Pleasant dreams. Mr. Fuller is here to see you. Fuller? You have pleasant dreams. Thank you, sweetheart. Fuller? Goodnight, my darling. Good night. Hello there. Marion ... What's the matter? Mr. Ferguson. Yes, he's late. We were going to the opera. That's it. He can't come. He can't come? I've just left him. Where? At home. At his house. He's ill, Marion, very ill. Ill? But he was alright this afternoon when I left him at the office. I know, it was at the club. He was there with Mr. Moore. Mr. EC Moore. You know? What happened? Well, he was there, as happy as could be, laughing at a joke ... Mr. Moore said it happened all in a moment. What happened? He collapsed suddenly. He sent you here? Yes. His one idea was that you shouldn't worry. Marion, you are his very life. Oh, I wish I could see him. Of course you can't. He's at home. I know, I know, I know... You're wanted on the telephone. Hello? Yes, Mrs. Ferguson. This is Marion Donnell. Yes. How is he? Hello? Hello? She rang off. What did Mrs. Ferguson want? She said he wanted me to come over. I should come over immediately. You'd better go. He's asked for you, and it must be serious. Get my wrap, quickly. Good evening, Dr. Beckles. Good night, Fuller. Doctor Conway. Good evening, Doctor. Ms. Donnell, this is Dr. Beckles and Dr. Conway. Is...? Ms. Donnell is Mr. Ferguson's secretary. Marion. You're Ms. Donnell? Yes. Will you go in, please? Shall we go in? He asked to see you ... alone. I'm sorry I kept you waiting. But it couldn't be helped, could it, Doctor? Please make your visit as brief as possible. Yes, I understand. Marion! Marion! Don't go away. Don't go away. You musn't leave me. You musn't leave me. Musn't... I'll be alright. I'll be alright... How beautiful you are. Don't go away. Please don't leave me. I love you. Marion, don't leave me, please ... Kiss me. Kiss me. Marion! Kiss me... Oh, how dark it's getting ... I love you... Take me away! Take me away! Marion! Marion! Marion! I told him to drive straight to the apartment. Is that right? Yes. Paper? Paper, lady? What's that? That's an outrage, the way they've distorted that. I don't need these papers to tell me what I am. Her eyes told me that night ... I'll never forget those eyes ... It seemed as though I'd stolen a part of her soul. Oh, it was awful. Well that's passed. You must think of your future. My future? Well, you're financially able to do almost anything you want to now. I'm not touching a penny of that money. What? I'm giving it all back. But you need money for your boy. Not this money. When he grows up, what can I tell him when he asks me where this money came from? Oh, how I'd like to undo this whole awful thing. Well don't get excited, Marion. Wait and we'll discuss the whole matter when we get to your apartment. I'm giving up the apartment as soon as I can. You are? I can't endure the place. It seems a part of that mad dream. I must have been mad. Hey, do you know any Beethoven? What? Hey, that bird wasn't there! I know it. You know it? Didn't want to play Steve. Listen, you punks. Here's my Marion Donnell story for Sunday. "The great secretary problem." Gee, this will set the wives up higher than a kite. "Should a wife have a hand in choosing her husband's secretary?" Oh, give the girls a chance. Or the wives will be picking them out of the old ladies home. And what about the secretaries? Oh, there's always the follies. There a lot of key punchers in this burg waiting for the boss to give them a little sugar. Well well well well, look what Grandma brought. The old man himself. Who? Ferguson, and with an autograph, too. "To Marion, from HF." That's Hector Ferguson, alright. It sure is. He certainly done something for this town. He certainly did. Say what's the lowdown on that bedside story when he kicked off? You mean about this Donnell girl and the wife at the deathbed? Yeah. I got the lowdown on that. Pretty sad ... He was in love with this Donnell girl, alright ... He was conservative, but he was no chaser. Hey fellas, look what I found. The plot thickens. There's a child! Say ... Say, bring the box down. Hey, wait a minute. Wait a minute. I'll handle this. Put the punk over there. Say, here you are. Who's this, sonny? Huh? Uncle Fergie. Uncle Fergie. Say, is that a story or not? Sounds pretty raw to me. Oh, the kid will never live that down. Well, his mother is still Ms. Donnell, isn't she? And that's Hector Ferguson, isn't it? Yes. The women will eat it up. Even the mayor will weep. There she is. How do you do, Ms. Donnelly ... What are you doing ... You can't take my baby's picture! They haven't taken anything. Are you sure? Yes. Where's my baby! Get out of my way! Get out of here, all of you! Beasts! Beasts! Get out and stay out! Don't ever come back! Get out, I say! Get out! I left him in bed. I can't be in two places at once. They must have stole him out of it. They've gone. I've got to tell them the truth. Tell them who Jackie's father is. How can you do that? They wouldn't believe you. They'd only distort the truth and make matters worse. There's only one person in the world who you should tell and that's the boy's father. Why, he doesn't even know the child exists. But he must be told. We telephone him and ask him to come here now. You think he'd come with this scandal now? We can soon find out. I haven't seen him in four years. What difference does that make? This is his obligation. But he's married. Even so, this is still his obligation. Lake Shore 4200. You think they could publish that? They could infer it. They're liable to say anything. Mr. Merrick's office. Mr. Merrick, Merrick Jr. They're calling you. Hello? Mr. Merrick. Mr. Jack Merrick, Jr. Ms. Donnell speaking. Yes, I'll wait. I must protect him, I must. Hello, yes, I'm waiting. Don't you see what this will do to him? In school, and after ... If it touches him, if he suffers through it ... I couldn't bear it, I couldn't ... Hello? Jack? This is Marion... Donnell. Could you come right over to see me? I can't, no, I can't tell you over the telephone. It's very important, very. 2460 Lake Shore Drive. Yes, I'll be waiting Alright. He's coming. That's right. I'm sure you'll find you've done the right thing. Now when he comes, tell him everything. After all, you are asking nothing for yourself. But you do need his help for his son. Let me know what happens. I will. You're such a good friend. Not at all. Cheer up, Marion, and good luck. Thanks. Goodbye. Goodbye. Get his clothes on. But he's in bed. Get his clothes on. Mr. Merrick is coming. Who? His father. Come on, darling, you're going to get dressed now. You want to get dressed? There'll be some rejoicing when those Merricks know they've got a son and heir. Young Merrick's wife can't never have a child of her own. Ever since she had that motorcrash up in France, she's been a cripple in a wheelchair. And there's no heir to all those millions but our young Jackie. No, there'll be joy bells ringin alright. Hurry, please. You'll have to watch out they don't try to steal him from you. Steal him? Well if that old man Merrick got it into his head that he wanted the child, with all his influence and money ... well we wouldn't stand a dog's chance against him. What are you talking about? Well, you know what you're about asking the father over here. But I'd watch out. They're an unscrupulous bunch. And ... And what? Well they'd have a lot on their side in the law courts with all the lies the newspapers are saying ... The law courts? Can't you see what this child means to that family? Yes ... I don't say that they would steal him, but it's on the cards they might. And those people never lose anything they go after. Come on, Jackie, get your socks on ... Don't dress him! Listen, darling. Sweetheart, listen to mother. Stay as quiet as a mouse and then I'll come back and read to you. Goodie, goodie! Blanche, don't go, please. Wait a moment. Go ahead. Ms. Donnell, please? Will you come in here, please, sir. Thank you. Hello, Marion. Hello, Jack. Didn't take you long to get here. You asked me to come right away. I know, something came up, and I thought I might need your help. You can bank on that anytime. But you see, it's all settled now. Are you sure? Because if there's anything I can do ... Thanks. You'd rather not tell me what it is? Well it's really of no importance now. I see. Well, that's that. You're looking very well. Thanks. So do you, a little thinner. I've three years hard work, I guess. Yes? It was awfully good of you to come over. I'm sorry I got you on a wild goose chase. Well if there is anything I can do, I hope you'll call on me. I will... Come here to me this minute! Let's put you to bed! Hello, Mommy. Hello, darling. Yours? Yes, mine. I see. I didn't believe it ... What? Well, I'd heard something about a child in Ferguson's will, but ... Is that what they're saying? I heard something about it. Well, good-bye, Marion. Take care of yourself. Jack! Wait, wait! Yes? Will you come with me? Why of course. Marion... Yes. Why didn't you tell me? Why didn't I know? You know now. You had to know. How old is he? How old would he be? I can't believe it. I can't believe it! Where was he born? Here in Chicago? Yes. Why didn't you come to me? I wanted to stand on my own. But was that fair to him? It's a serious thing, having a child. Yes it is. What reason could you possibly have had by keeping him away from me? I called on you today because I felt he needed your protection. Of course, of course. Would you have let me go away today without ... I was afraid ... Afraid of me, his father? I was afraid you might try to take him from me. Marion! Can you blame me? I know. I know. We musn't think of that. We must just think of him now. You don't know how I've longed for something like this. And something just like this, too! You young husky, it's your dad. Your dad! Look at me, it's your own father, you monkey. He is like you, Jack. Of course he is, I saw it right away. He's reminded me of you often. Really? Really. I can't understand ... What? Oh, nothing, never mind ... I've got him now, haven't I? I've got you now, you young Samson. There we are. Say, Marion, this is a tough kid, do you know it? How much does he weigh? Thirty pounds. Yes, and then some. He's got the Merrick jaw, alright, hasn't he? You're a Merrick, aren't you? Jack, you will stand by him now, won't you? You try and stop me. We must stop that rumor. We'll stop it, alright. Leave that to Dad. Gee, just wait til he knows about this. You're his father. Anything that must be done, you'll do, will you? Marion, why didn't you come to me before? Look at us, Marion. Just we three. Jack... You know, Marion, when you left me I went to Paris. I had to get away. Everything here reminded me of you. I went crazy over there. Then Flip Carson came over. In spite of what I was doing, she seemed to understand. Well, we were married, and then the smash-up ... you know. Yes, I remember that day. I thought I was going under at first. I didn't care much. The only thing I could think of was what a weak-kneed rotter I'd been. And I swore to myself that if I pulled through I'd try to be more of the man you wanted me to be. Did you, Jack? I swore I'd find you. I'd chuck Dad and the money. I'd find you. And it was that that pulled me through. That thought. Yes, Jack. Then, when I was convalescent, they showed me poor little Flip, ... All battered up, so patient and brave. I remembered your words, you know, about being a man and sticking. So I stuck. But I've been working too, Marion. All the time. Oh, I'm proud of you. Marion, we've got to come together again. But we can't. We must. We can't. Why? We just can't. You mean, because you don't love me? I won't pretend. You must. We both must. Why? Jack, we haven't a moment to lose. The reporters were here this afternoon and they were inferring that Jackie was ... Was what? What you heard. I'm afraid of the newspapers. We must stop them. Gee, what time is it? Six o'clock. We can take care of the newspapers, alright. You leave everything to me. Jack, I won't rest until I hear from you. When I get things fixed up, I'll come back and let you know. Alright. I'll be here by nine o'clock anyway. Goodbye. Goodbye. Bye, Daddy. Oh, darling, oh my sweet! My sweetheart! Aren't you a sweet. I love you mother. Oh do you? I love you, oh, you sweetheart. Oh, how good. Do you want to go to bed now? No? Of course not. But you have to. You have to go to bed. Oh, don't you tickle me. My darling, my sweet. Come on, now go to bed, darling. Oh, don't tickle mother! Sorry to have disturbed you so late. It's all right. Do you mind bringing the other trunks up, too? The two that are downstairs? If you please. Never mind, Fred. We're taking just what we barely need. ... for you, and the baby, and myself. I have the baby's right here. Fine. I'm sorry to see you go, miss. Oh, thanks, Fred. Bon voyage to you. Thank you. Shout if you want anything. I will. Goodbye. Goodbye. Nice young man. Single, too. Pity we're going away. So you're giving it all up. Oh, what a relief that'll be. That's true, too. We're gonna get back to something normal. Something we can call our own. What are you going to do when you go to work? Oh I don't know. I've got lots of ideas. This young Merrick's in love with you. Don't they? Yes? And what's more, you're in love with him. No, that's impossible. But he's coming again tonight. He promised to see that Jackie's name is protected. Coming here to let me know it happened. And I'm starting all over again. A clean new page. Is that why you're leaving so sudden? Because you're afraid to see much of him? No, I'm not afraid of anything. From now on I'm going to fight back. Out of it all. Madame, Mr. Merrick is here. Oh thanks. Blanche, I've got some things in the other room. Will you bring them in here? Good evening. Good evening. I'd like to see this child. I'm sorry, he's in bed asleep. You've convinced my son pretty thoroughly that this boy is his. He convinced himself. I have further proof if he needs it. What was your reason for withholding the fact of the child's existence until now? I'd rather not discuss that. Well, what was your motive in calling upon us today? I called upon Jack! Why? Because my baby needed his father's protection. Jack's told me the circumstances and I'm prepared to do the right thing. Yes? When I say the right thing, I remind you that I have no heir beyond Jack ... and this child's place in the world ... I understand all that! I am willing to take this child. A normal child? You're robbing that child of his place in the world. His place in the world is with me, his own mother! Mother? What sort of a mother are you? How dare you? We can take that child from you! You can't! Can't we? Are you a fit person to bring up a child? Could you convince a court of law that you are? A court of law? Yes, a court of law! I'll fight you if it takes every dollar I've got in the world and I'll win that child in open court! You couldn't. Couldn't I? Suppose I tell the court it's not Jack's child? You'd brand him that, eh? No, no, no! Yes, you would. Yes, you would, you'd do anything. I got your number the first time I ever laid eyes on you. When you lured my boy up there to that place on the Lake. You were after him them for what you thought you could get, and you're after him now. Am I? You are! I am, of course I am. And I can take him. Ms. Donnell, please. You're fighting me for my son. Alright, I'll fight you for yours. I'll take him from you! Marion! Jack, I forbad you to come here! I know, dad, but... Jack, do you remember what you said this afternoon that we should come back together again? Yes Dear. You love me, you've always loved me ... You love our son. Isn't it true we should never have been parted, should we? It is true. Jack! Jack! Jack, I begged you to send him away before and you failed me. Send him away. Don't fail me now! You must listen to me. It's all up, dad. Please go. I know what I'm doing. Oh, you contemptable creature ... Oh, get out of here, get out! I'm through! Well I'm not through. Marion, Marion, did you mean that? Of course I did. Then you do love me. I do love you, Jack. Oh, we'll go away at once. I'll never fail you again, never. We'll take our boy and go away. Just we three? Nothing will ever separate us again ever. Nothing ever. We'll start all over again. We'll go away. Yes. You get ready. I'll arrange everything and come back for you. Alright. Dearest. I'll be waiting. Pack everything. We're going away. We're leaving tomorrow. Have you changed your plans? Yes. Where are we going now? Europe, anywhere, I don't know. Then you're not giving everything up? No. I'm not giving anything up. You say this will smash your life. But what have you done to my life? I had your best interests at heart. Oh, but you haven't got a heart. You've tried to run my life the way you run your business. And I wish you were as sound as my business. I'm glad I'm not. I'm human. Human? You, human to absent that wife of yours? Who trusted her life to a useless no good bum in Paris? I know. Do you realize? That half the time, when that child is smiling, that poor little body of hers is in torture? I know that, too. You know? And yet you can leave her in that chair of pain, alone? Her spirit broken, her heart broken. With nothing, nothing in the world but the memory of you, her husband who had left her for a creature whose name no decent person would ... Stop it, stop it! I haven't got a heart, eh? I'm inhuman, am I? Have you a heart? Are you human? Stop it, stop it, yes I tell you! Don't I know? You brought all this about. Didn't you? Didn't you? May I come in? Hello, dear. Hello, Papa Merrick. Hello, Jack. Hello, dear. I came with the dawn. Yes, dear, I'm coming home right now. I got anxious. I telephoned and from the man's voice, I gathered that something must be wrong. No, no, Dad and I had to get straight on something, that's all. Don't you look so glum, Papa Merrick. Alright, dear, alright but ... You shouldn't be out like this. Oh, it's a glorious morning. The sun shining and the birds are singing. It's good to be alive. And you two old fogeys arguing in a musty old room. Can I know what this is all about? I'll tell you at home. There's a lot to tell. I can guess most of it. Did you tell Papa Merrick about finding the boy? Yes, yes, dear, I did, yes ... Can't I be in on it? Catherine ... Would you go along and leave Jack here with me? There's nothing more. I'll go with you now. You want me to sail along and leave you two alone? Alright, I will. No, I'll go with you. Jack, please, this may be the last thing I'll ever ask you. When he asks like that, you better stay. I'll sail along. I'll be dying to hear, though. I'll go with you. No, Frederic is waiting for me. Frederic! What's the use? Let's not start all over again. Oh boy, don't you realize? That you're all I've got in this world. What a beautiful morning to be going away. Your tea, madame. Blanche, is it cold in France now? Pardon, madame? Is it cold in France now? Yes, in the north of France, it's very cold. But in the south of France, it's warm. What you call "sunny." The sunny south of France. France, is it now? I thought we were going to good ol Londontown. Your tea, madame. You haven't had any sleep all night. Well, we'll sleep on the train. You might. But Mr. Jackie will have something to say about me. There's your bell. What's the matter? I'm what the Americans term "all in." My feet will go just so far and no further. We'd better send some of these toys to the poor little boys in the orphanage. We'll never pack them. Madame. What is it? A crippled lady. Ask her to come in. Mrs. Merrick? Watch out for trouble now. Go in the other room. I'll prepare to get back to London. Alright, Frederic, wait downstairs. Yes madame. Thank you. Nice wide doors! In here? I can manage, thank you. Ms. Donnell? Yes? May I come in? Yes, do. I'm Flip Merrick, Jack's wife. How do you do? I'm glad I found you out. It's an unearthly hour for calling, isn't it? It's quite alright. Could we talk for a minute? Yes. Where should we sit? Do you mind if I smoke? No, not at all. I'll get you a match. Looks like moving day. You going away? Yes, we're leaving today. I'm glad I caught you. Do you smoke? No, not now. Do sit down. Marion Donnell. Jack told me about finding you yesterday. Though I only saw him for a moment, he could talk of nothing else. And of the boy too. Yes? I suppose you're wondering why I'm here. I'll tell you why. I have just left Papa Merrick's house. Jack and his father have been at it all night. They're nervous wrecks, both of them. And they won't let me in on what it's all about. You don't know? They wouldn't tell me a thing, but ... I have a pretty shrewd idea. Jack said he'd have lots to tell me when he got home ... but I did feel that while he and his father were apparently deciding so much ... we two women should have some say in the matter ourselves. Yes. Ms. Donnell, I've loved Jack Merrick since I was a child in arms. And I've always been teased about it. You know, I didn't know about you until after Jack and I were married. No? He told me about your elopement. Ever since then I've wanted to meet you. Meet me? I've thanked you a thousand times from the bottom of my heart. Why do you thank me? I think you had a great deal to do with the molding of Jack's character. He's been splendid, so kind and gentle and ... May I ask why you came here? Because I want you to take him. Take him? What do you mean? I mean, take him. Not only because he's madly in love with you, but there's the boy and ... because it's right. And you love him? Of course. And loving him, you could give him up to me? What right have I to hold onto someone because I happen to love him? What can I be to him? I'm only half a wife. Isn't love finer than our bodies? Nothing's finer than a son. He wants children. Who doesn't want a child of their own? Yes, I see. I don't say this thing doesn't hurt, but love is a beautiful thing. It's the only thing. And nothing fine comes without it's pain, doesn't it? You found that out when your baby came, didn't you? It's because I love him I can give him up. Because you love him, you can give him up? Yes. But I don't love him. No? No. Are you being quite true to yourself? Yes I am. I am. Mrs. Merrick, whatever you may think of me, please know that ... I have no intention ... I don't love Jack. My plans are made. Yesterday when he came here, he told me all about you. Of his love, his great love for you ... I know, Ms. Donnell ... It that the youngster? Yes, he wakes at the crack of dawn. Could I? Would you like to see him? Please. If you don't mind the muddle. Oh, not at all. Shall we go? Thank you so much. And we're going to have a beautiful time. Oh, hello, curly head. Good morning. Good morning to you, I'm sure. Oh, he's marvelous. I have a picture of Jack as a child that looks just like him. Oh, could I? How old is he? Just over three. Oh, bless him. What's his name? Jackie ... Jack. Jackie, well, well well. How would you like to go for a ride, hmm? Jack! I just left Dad. It's all over. I left him actually crying. It was awful. I'm on my way home now to tell Flip. Your wife is here. Here? Yes, she's in there with the baby. But... Without knowing what we had planned behind her back, she came here to give you to me. She said she could give you up because she loved you so much. I told her I did not love you and that such a thing was impossible. But why? Why? Because her sacrifice showed me what a horrible, selfish love our love would be. She showed me a finer love. Jack, you've got to stand by her. You're going on with her. But what about you and me? Our love will be a greater love if we do our duty. Our duty is to our son. Are you thinking of him? Yes, I am. He needs my protection. You've no right to deny him that. Do you think I haven't longed for him to know and love his father? But Jack, I want to be worthy of his love. I don't want to sink any lower ever. Sink lower? What do you mean? I'm not going to rob that brave little woman of her life. I can't. I won't. But you'd rob me of my son? What can you do for him alone? You called on me yesterday and I came, didn't I? In the position you admit you've placed yourself in, could you protect him as I could? Could you? Why, hello, Jack. I've got a nerve calling at this hour in the morning. Oh, I was dying to see him. I simply had to. Now I've seen him, I'm satisfied. Yes, he's fine, isn't he? Thank you for letting me see him, Ms. Donnell. You'll forgive me for bursting in on you like this, won't you? I'm glad you came. You two want to talk? Oh, no, no. Little curly head. You know, Ms. Donnell, he confided in me a profound secret. He's dying for a pony. I want a pony. I foolishly told him that if he was staying in Chicago instead of going off to foreign parts, that I'd give him one. That Shetland Pony, you know. Yes. I bought a Shetland thinking he could be trained to pull this chariot of mine around in the country, but Jack wouldn't hear of it. He had sordid visions of smash-ups and runaways. I told him he wouldn't be losing very much if I ... Flip, please don't! Don't say that. I'm sorry, Jack. I was only kidding. I think you'd better take Mama Flip home. She's tired. Goodbye, Marion, darling. Goodbye. Goodbye, you little curly head. Bye. Nice wide doors! Now we pick out the toys for the poor little orphan boys who have no nice home to live in and no mother to care for them. Ms. Potter, put his hat and coat on and yours, too. Don't say anything. Go. Come along, Jackie. Mommy, where are we going? Darling, do you remember the lady that was here in the wheelchair? Yes. Do you know what she said about the pony? Yes. Would you like to ride on the pony? Yes! Would you, darling? Yes. Take him over. Stay with him always. Go ... Go. Ms. Donnell... Come along. Take your ride on the pony. Jackie! Jackie, come back to me, come back! You know mother likes to see your collar outside. Like that. Jackie! Jackie... Oh, Jackie... Did you get that? Alright then. Add this: If we can get an appropriation for five million dollars more ... We can get this over. Five... Five million more will be enough ... Wait a minute, wait a minute, will you ... Say, listen you ... Listen! Will you stop that pussycatting and have that child's hair cut? You'll have him lookin' like a bloomin' convict, that's what. Better he look like that than look like a girl. And you keep your nose out of this and tend to your own affairs. I suppose he ain't my affairs, eh? Say, another word out of you and you're fired. Oh, fire yourself, you old fussbudget. Now you do that right. Madame, I have a lady downstairs waiting for finger waves, madame. Then you'd better go and do your fingering right now. Wait just a moment, just a moment, please! But madame, please, I cannot stay here all day long. Listen, will you please cut this boy's hair? Well you all make me so nervous! Make you nervous! You know his father doesn't want his hair cut ... Get out of here, get out of here! What's all the shootin' for? Mr. Jack, just see what they've done to him. They've almost ruined him. Who did that? Your father. He said he didn't like the curls, it made him look like a little girl and so he had the man cut them all off. That's what he did. It's alright, Ms. Potter, it's not so bad. We can fix this. Oh, I don't know. Chicago! Say, did he mean me? You ought to know. You're from Chicago. Hello? Hello? This is Mr. Merrick again. Now take this letter, please. Josh Carson, Chicago Chemical Works ... Chicago, Illinois. Dear Josh... Our thoughts will be with you on Sunday in memory of dear little Flip. A year slips by quickly, doesn't it? Say, Jack, Jack, I'm sending a letter to Grandad Carson. Anything you want to say? No, just give him my love. I wrote him this morning and told him how we miss little Flip. Poor old fella, he must be pretty lonely. Jackie is very well and sends his love. He's growing a mile a minute ... Oh, dad ... Tell him Ms. Potter will send him a postcard from London. We're sailing for England tomorrow night. Ms. Potter will send you a postcard from London. We shall discharge her immediately upon arriving there ... for impudence, impertinence ... Now read that back to me, will you? What? I can't understand you. Are you talking English? I asked you to read that letter back to me. Do you get that? Do - you - get - that? My dear young woman, will you please read that letter back to me! Dad, take it easy, take it easy! These New York people. They're all the same. Alright, I'll take it. Hello. Alright, miss, now will you please read the letter back to me. I say will you please read the letter back to me. Dear Josh, Our thoughts will be with you on Sunday in memory of dear little Flip. A year passes so quickly, doesn't it? Little Jackie... Jackie... Is very well and sends his love... Sends his love ... Growing... He's growing a mile a minute... He's growing a mile a minute ... I can't hear you very distinctly. Jack, Jack... Jack! This is Marion! What? It's Marion! Jack, it's Marion! Jackie, I found her! I found her, Jackie! I found her!
