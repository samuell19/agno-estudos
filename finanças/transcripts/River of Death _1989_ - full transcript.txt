Heil! Daughter. What are you doing here? But, Daddy... I told you never to come in here. Now go back to the quarters. Put it over here. What do you want, Captain Schuster? These experiments must stop. This time you have gone too far. Isn't it enough what we have already done to these people? Better them than you. This is no joke. I've already checked and these experiments are unauthorized. Unless you... - You been checking on me? Unless you end them now, I shall send in my report. How can I persuade you not to? You cannot. Then I must. Heil Hitler. Heil! Dr. Manteuffel. Heinrich, what are you doing here? Change of plans. The Russians have broken through our lines. What? You said... I know what I said, but I was wrong. The Third Reich has less than a week to live. You must leave in three days. What about my experiments? I can't leave now. Somehow, I don't think the Russians will understand. Captain Schuster. Come, pack up your test tubes. You'll have time. You will have time and money. Money to carry on with your mad experiments. I don't do that. Don't call me mad. I don't mean it, Wolfie. You know that. You shall have your new order. And this time, it will succeed. How much have you collected for Field Marshal Goering? Enough. More than enough. He doesn't need it. We do. Listen, Wolfie, only last week, a Tintoretto, a gigantic Rubens and a Gauguin. The Fuehrer hates him. Decadent, I know. I shall make money with our money. Money, money, money, and girls. Girls, Wolfie. I shall have the girls and you shall conquer the world. How much time do we have? They want me to rejoin our beloved Fuehrer in Berlin in his final days. It's an engagement I shall have to miss. Then we shall leave together from Wilhelmshaven. Excellent. It's the Armagnac '87. Our last toast in Germany. This belonged to a man I worshipped. My father. Take it. Wear it as a token of my feeling for you. I shall wear only this... forever. To the success of your experiments and to my new career as a businessman in South America. Our destiny. Heil, Heinrich. Heil, Wolfie. To Gauguin. Like nectar. The other planes have taken off, Herr Doctor. I suggest we leave immediately. You're putting me and those other men in mortal danger. I do not welcome mortal danger any more than you do, but I'm under the personal seal of Field Marshal Goering. I, for one, do not intend to disobey his orders. Court-martial me for saying this, but damn Goering and his seal! We leave now. He's already damned. We wait. In heaven's name, let us go! - No! We complete the loading. All right! Hurry up! You want to die here? It is you who wants us to die here. Wolfie, I have the Gauguin. I have the... The devil rides on your back. But I'll find you. I'll find you! I shall be the devil on your back. Well, it's not much further. Taken all kinds of people into this jungle. Most of them thrill seekers, dreamers. But this doctor, what's he out here for? Whatever it is, it ain't good. He's got it, just like the others. It's eating away at his body. Why only Indians? Ask him where there are other villagers with the disease. He says he knows of a village where men can never leave. Some days from here, a place all fear. Tell him we want to go there. I'm here to stop the disease, but I must find the source. He says he'll show us how to get there. They don't want to go to the village with us. Say it's full of demons. Well, they work for you, don't they? You did pay them, didn't you? Well, then, I'm going to sleep. We have a big day tomorrow. Come along, Anna. You need your rest. Of course, when you're out here all the time, you miss a few things. Then again, good things come to those who wait. Anna! Good night, Anna. Good night, Doc. Good night, love. Hey, Doc. Wake up! We got a little problem. He says we're crazy. There's only death up that river. Yes, and disease. But that's why we must go. What are you saying to him? You don't want to know. I don't like the feeling of this. Maybe I should have told the doc I'd never been up this way before. Five-hundred miles away from civilization. I can't think about that right now. Papa! Papa! How does that feel, Dad? Better? I'm all right. What about you? They didn't hurt you, did they? I'm okay. The disease. It could be spreading from here. Possibility. I must get some more blood samples. Okay. Come on, now. Take it easy! John? You all right? - I've been better. Here. Tie the door shut. Move. God, man. You'll burn us to death. Just do what I say. Okay. Stand over there. Come on. Hurry. Hurry! Watch your head. Keep going. Dad! Just, please, get up! Help! Come on! No! He's dead! No! No! He's dead! Anna! - John! Guard the samples. Halt! Let him go. The jungle will take care of him. You left her there. Well, what was I supposed to do? Fight a whole tribe barehanded? A whole tribe and some guy with a gun. You got to get back there, man. You've got to get that girl out of there. No. The samples. Doc's blood. Now I'm seeing things. Welcome back, Hamilton. Where's the brass band for the returning hero? I guess they never noticed I was gone. Or didn't care. Thanks, buddy. And you think the killer was a white man? That's quite a story, Hamilton. And you've told a lot of them. But, let me tell you something that you know. There is no la ciudad perdida. That's why it's called the Lost City, because it's lost. It's a myth, Hamilton. Forget it. I have maps that locate it. Can I keep these? So, you'll help me get back there? I didn't say that, but I'd like to study these. You help me, you see the map. Otherwise, I'll go back for her myself. Even if these maps are true, which I doubt, you and I both know it's impossible for one man to get there and back. I'm gonna get that girl out of there. If she's still alive. Keep in touch. Get him! Get him! Hey, come on, come on, I got money! Hey, hey, hey! Give me that! Hey! Thank you. Who's got money? Come on now! How much more you want? Your four, that will be... Well, John Hamilton, the all-American boy. I heard you were back. Heard some other things, too. Word travels fast, Eddie? Doesn't it, though. You look like hell. I've been through hell. How'd you like to go back there with me? No, thanks. I've been there too many times. I kind of figured that, but you'll outfit me, yeah? Yeah. But why you going back? You got paid. I contract to do a job, I finish it. It is finished. The girl's got to be dead by now. She's not dead. All right, if that's the way you want it. My cost plus... thirty percent. Old pal. \ "Old pal.\". No one's backing me this trip, Eddie. You're really going back there, aren't you? Okay, cost plus ten percent, but that is it and I mean that's it! And I want cash. Anybody this crazy can't be trusted. You give me a list of what you want, I'll see what I can do. You really are crazy. Just get me what I need. Signed, \ "A friend.\". Right. Not in this town, buddy. Find what you were looking for? I don't need this shit. Who are you with? Fancy shoes? Or maybe you're one of Diaz's persuaders, is that it? We are not with anyone you know. He talks. Have you heard of a doctor called Manteuffel? No, I use a doctor here in town. Manteuffel was a Nazi doctor who performed hundreds of ghastly experiments on prisoners during the war. We believe you may have found where this man is hiding. I did? Well, he's not in my room. You checked. We are talking about the Lost City you may have found up the Rio Da Morte, Mr. Hamilton. Wait a second. Who are you? - This is Dalia. My name's Pare. We work for people in Vienna. We search for Nazi criminals who escaped after the war. So, what do you want from me? More correctly, it is what we can do for you, Mr. Hamilton. You want to go back there, but it is very difficult for one man. We can help you, if you take us along. There are a lot of people who can help me. Why should I pick you? You know what we want and we know what you want. That's trust. These other people may not be so honest. You want a table or you're just looking? No, Eddie said to meet him here. He's, he's over there. And he seems to be enjoying himself. Who is he with? He's your friend. Enjoy yourself. And talk to Hamilton about the money. Yes, sir. You know who that is? Surprise me. - Did you ever hear of Carl Bergens? Rings a bell. It should. He's Bergens of Bergens International. Yeah. I've seen his picture in all the papers. Owns half the world, doesn't he? Yeah. And he wants to share it with, you and me. He wants to go to the Lost City. Funny how the whole town knows about it. Why's he want to go? He's an amateur anthropologist or something. Didn't you know that? - No, I didn't know that. Yeah, says if he can find and study the Lost Tribe he'd be fulfilling a lifelong dream. Sounds like a bunch of shit to me. I don't know. He can be very persuasive. And he's used to getting what he wants. Get them champagne. Ha! Compliments of Mr. Bergens. This is real nice, Eddie. Does he have anything else to offer? How about $15,000? What? I can't hear you. $20,000. Can you speak up? - You son of a bitch. He's prepared to pay $30,000. And I'm prepared to accept $50,000. You're fucking with the golden goose, John. And you're fucking with me, Eddie! I'll take $45,000. $40,000 That's his final offer. Deal. Introduce me to the man. Not here. He'll call you. No, I'll call him. Give me a number. I understand you've been very busy. Yeah, and I'm tired, so why don't you get out of here so I can get some rest? You may be in Romano for quite a while. There'll be plenty of time for sleep. Well, I don't think I'll be here long at all. Your motive for going to that Lost City of yours is not some little girl. I think you may have found something else there. Well, if that is so, let me warn you. Anything that you find belongs to the state. And the state, which is me, will definitely exercise its claim. That's bullshit! Besides, whatever I do or don't find, you ought to take my word for it. Perhaps, yes, if I allow you to go. Good night. All right. Keep in touch. Our discussion is not finished. Don't you ever answer the phone, darling? Hello? - Mr. Bergens, this is John Hamilton. Hamilton. - Yeah. May we welcome you aboard? Excellent. No, meeting here. 9 o'clock tomorrow morning. Good night. He agreed? Yeah. We are going to the Lost City. You will come with me? I wouldn't miss it for the world. This is the happiest moment... of my life. Hey, Hamilton? Mr. Bergens asked me to show you in. Hey, hey, hey! This way. Son of a bitch! Don't trouble yourself, I'll find my own way. You make quite an entrance, Mr. Hamilton. The gentleman pulling himself up from the ground is Mr. Tracy. A security man from my company. Why don't you come up? I'll introduce you to the others. Welcome, Mr. Hamilton. This is Maria, my secretary... and my very good friend. Mr. Hiller you know, of course. John. This is, Mr. Fanjul, the leading columnist on my chain of newspapers. Can't say I know your stuff. Don't speak Portuguese too well. It's a pity. - Yeah, isn't it? Now that we've all met, why don't we take a look at some of these maps? No problem. What kind of... of maps are those? My maps. Even if you manage to get them, they're useless without me to interpret them. We start from here, at Romano. Our party goes in the biggest chopper we can get. A second one carries the equipment and fuel. We hopscotch upriver to about here, and then it's by foot. Good. Then we can approach the city quietly. Why would we want to do that, Mr. Bergens? These Indians are dangerous. You told me that yourself. I don't remember talking to you about any Indians. Go on, Mr. Hamilton. How did it go? - Piece of cake. It's okay. Now what? Out of the car. Get in, Hamilton. I want you to do a favor for me. This is Mr. Serrano. He's a government expert in Indian affairs and he's most interested to learn about those Indians that you say you saw at your Lost City. Perhaps you'll be able to enlighten him sometime as a favor to me? Why not? Well, keep in touch. Yeah. I'll do that. So what are you doing? You know what, Johnny? When I woke up this morning, I started feeling very, very guilty. So I thought to myself, \"Well, I think, I'll go down to church to confession before it's too late.\". You in church? Come on, more like the local whorehouse. Well, sounded all right at the time, didn't it? You seen that other pilot around? Nah, fucked if I know, he landed and pissed off somewhere, mate. See you later. - Yeah. Good morning, Mr. Bergens. Good morning, Mr. Hiller. Sir. Glad you could make it, Mr. Bergens. Who is this? Another member of my party. He's our interpreter. What are you up to? You have spoken to no one about this mission? Looks like your boyfriend doesn't like the company I keep. Come along, Maria. Long John. Don't lag for us. You can move on ahead. We'll catch you at Zone One. Okay, I'll see you in a couple of hours. I nearly forgot. Vera told me to remind you. Don't forget the dinner next Tuesday. She's cooking up something special. If it's like the last meal, let's eat out. What the hell is that? We're losing power! We're going down. Over there. Can you land it? What the hell do you think I'm doing? Long John, can you hear me? Over. Come in, Long John. Shit, Johnny. Come in, damn it! Brace yourselves! Long John? Johnny? Johnny, come in. - Get out quick! There might be a leak. Quick, move! Get out. - My suitcase. I must have my suitcase. Come on! Get that gear! Come on, come on. Get off, now! Go! Get away, the chopper could blow! What the hell was that? Take cover. Mr. Bergens. Look out, Mr. Bergens! Who are they? River pirates. Get down. Where is he going? Coward! You bastard! You set us up! Let's get the hell out of here! All right, John. Yeah! Come back, you chickens! I'll show you! Cowards, come back! Hamilton, we got them on the run. Come back, chickens! You're a real holy terror, Serrano. They'll be back. But we must prepare to defend, to dig in. Something. No, I got a better idea. Nico! Come on. Light it. Look, over there! Come on! Let's get out of here! Stay down. Nice work, Dalia. I think they got the message. Now, if this cruise ship holds together... Silver better be waiting for us, or we're really gonna be up shit creek without a paddle. He'll be there. How much you think that broad cost Bergens? Ten times as much as he paid for you. Hey, hold on, old sport. You was only offering gold at the end of the rainbow. Bergens here, he threw in the pot. Not to mention money up front. Hamilton, you want me to take over? Hiller will take it when I need it. Hey, Hamilton. Thanks, back there. Yeah. Look. It's all right. They're the Chipote tribe. If we are not aggressive, they will leave us alone. We're caught on something! It's a snare. Shit! I'm going over to free the propeller. - Yeah. Good work, John. We got them on the run. Run, you bastards! Now we're clear! What's the matter? Your friend Bergens snore? Why are you so cold-blooded? Last time I made this trip, I didn't do such a good job. I'm not gonna let that happen again. So now you're making us all pay for it? I didn't invite you all to come along. Bergens is paying me. But you, what's your interest? It's not like Bergens is your type. What is my type? I don't think they've made him yet. I've been around a few women, but this one, she's like a debutante holding her nose in a cattle yard. Good old Long John. He didn't forget us. Johnny? John? Must be out hunting up some food. Johnny? I thought you said these Indians were harmless? They were not the Chipote tribe. Then who were they? I don't know. Look, I don't give a shit who did it. This is a lot more than I bargained for. Hiller is right. It is too risky. You shut up. Just what did you think you were bargaining for, Mr. Hiller? Look, Bergens, I can fly this thing... Then we must take a vote, see who wants to go back. Nobody goes back! Except you, you sniveling prick. You can walk back alone. Now, take it easy, Bergens. We all got to have the chance to have our say. You took my money. So far as I am concerned, you have no say. Let him speak. Mr. Hamilton. I... I am so sorry about your friend, Mr. Hamilton, but a tragedy like this makes it imperative that we stick together. Please, a private talk. I know you will want to hear what I have to say. Okay, hang on. I'll be right back. My real name is Steinberg. I am a Jew. At the beginning of the war, I was taken to Dachau with my wife, and my two sons. My sons were gassed to death. The camera, give it to me. You are a spy. You are in with Kellner. Admit it. There was a doctor, a Nazi. He conducted experiments on the prisoners. He killed my wife. She died screaming. After the war, like many Nazis, he fled to another country. I have spent a fortune searching. Now, I'm near him. I know it. How can you be that sure? I know he is in the Lost City, and I want him. I want him with a desire greater than I have felt for anything. A kind of love. Do you understand, Hamilton? A deadly love. We're being tracked. We must go back. No, we go on. I have been talking with Mr. Hamilton, and we agree we must finish what we have started. No matter what the cost. Hiller, start the helicopter. We are going back. None of you are to be trusted. Now, Carl, tell them who you really are. What you really want. Now, come on, don't be foolish... Stop! I am serious. I will shoot. Hiller, start it up! Don't come any closer. So, we continue. I assume the rest of us are going on? But what about the helicopter? If I take it home, Hamilton, somebody's gonna have to babysit it. And you volunteer? Well, I'm the only one that can fly it, unless you wanna stay back. All right. But I'm warning you, Eddie, you decide to take off for greener pastures, and I'll find you, and when I do, I'll blow a hole in you from your butt to your brains. And that you can bet on. Okay. We'll load most of these supplies on the boat and move on. Eddie, we'll see you within a week. Pare! Dalia! Son of a bitch! Come on, where are you? There you are. Look out. The fuel drums. It's gonna blow. Everybody off, away from the boat! Mr. Hamilton. Do we have a use for this? Thank you. How far is it to the Lost City? By foot, three, four days. Mr. Hamilton, there is something very important you must know. Manteuffel's research was funded by an SS officer called Heinrich Spaatz. They planned to escape together after the war with a sizeable fortune. For some reason, Manteuffel crippled Spaatz with a bullet in the knee. Spaatz is still very much alive, Mr. Hamilton. You okay? - Yes. I can look after her. Thank you, Mr. Hamilton. Like you looked after your wife and children in Dachau? Careful, Colonel. Search over there. - Yes, Colonel. Go. There he is! I wouldn't if I were you. I heard you brag once you flew a helicopter in Korea. Then you've just saved your own life. What is it? Tuli territorial signs. They're flesh eaters. Cannibals. According to my map, we're well clear of their village. We'll be okay. But the Tulis never stay in one place too long. I haven't steered us wrong yet, have I? Mr. Hamilton... We may be all right. They traditionally only eat their enemies. Tell him we'll keep them. They bring good luck to us. I don't speak their language. Why didn't you tell me that before? Would it have made any difference? Hey! You have to let them keep the weapons. The chief appears to be dead serious. Come on! So where is this secret government outpost? Diaz says the chopper's out of fuel. If he pulls something, who do I got without Pare and Dalia? Come on! He's not gonna make it. Leave him. We go on. We can't leave him alone. I'll carry him. Leave him! - I won't. All right, Hamilton. Throw down your weapon. Come on. So what next, Colonel? We march that way. Your turn to take orders, Colonel. You are threatening the Chief of Police. Who is this guy? Do you wanna tell me what's going on? That's what's going on. Welcome to our little corner of the world. Now, Mr. Hamilton. You disobeyed my orders and have no right to be here. And you attacked me. So, to teach you a lesson, I'll take you for a little walk. Guess where to? The Lost City at last. Schnell, get moving. What about Hiller? We can't leave him alone. I'll carry him. He's not dead. He is now. You son of a... - Stop! Or you'll be shot! Get your hands off me! Move. Come on, move. Move faster. World's purest water. Has healing powers that are legendary. The Indians say it comes from the center of the earth. From here, my small stream grows. Feeds the whole world's rivers and oceans. An almost humbling thought, is it not? No one but these people know you are here? No one. Welcome. Doctor Manteuffel, I presume? Did we pass inspection? What a heroic man to have taken this couple through fierce jungles, dangerous rivers, warring Indians, all to save a girl, who may or may not be alive. You may rest now, Mr. Hamilton, your role is quite finished. The other two I don't understand why. Why a reasonable man and a woman would want to journey here? But let them stay. - Yeah. Keep your hands off me. Yeah. Asshole! My God. This is the place you were searching for, Doc. All these people... from so many tribes. What has Manteuffel done to them? Anna? How are you? I'm alive, for now. No, don't. My father was wrong. It isn't only the Indians who can get the disease. But how? It's Manteuffel's work. He's... - The reunion is over. You must leave. They sometimes let me care for these people. Comfort them before... Before they die. Goodbye, John. We'll think of something. Yeah, I came back, all right, only to see her die. This is power. The most potent form of death ever devised by man. You know why? Because it will eliminate only the weak, the repulsive, and the scum of this world. It's a perfect weapon, because the chosen ones have nothing to fear. It is clear that your return has a far greater purpose to our future. You speak English. I know many languages. That man, he is consumed in evil. And you, you have returned to destroy him. It is prophesied. What's going on here? What's all this talk about? Go take care of your sick animals. Hands off! You... See. The prophecy has already begun. We are here to help you. Halt! See what's happening! No! No! You won't stop us, Hamilton! This country is going to be ours. You won't stop our new order. Nothing will! Never mind the other guns. We will find a way to silence them. You must get into the temple now. Climb through the mouth. That is the way in. Hitler suffered and died, suffered for us, died for the German race. In 20 years, no one has come forth. Now I am ready. I am ready to strike. You're as mad as ever, Wolfie. Who are you? Wolfie wanted to be Fuehrer. Wolfie wanted to be king. Here's your father's ring, Wolfie. You gave it to me. Heinrich Spaatz. Yes. I am your devil, Wolfie. I am the devil on your back. You tried to kill me, but you only broke my knee. Nowadays, I walk with a stick. This stick. This stick which has waited for you. You have a gun? Thank you. Which knee shall we break first? No. - That one. No! Wolfie. - No. No. Please. Please. No. Shit! Put the gun down! Easy with that flare gun. It'll blow the whole place up. You, Hamilton, away from both of them. Well done, Maria. Give me the gun. No. You get back there with the other German. What are you doing, Maria? Doctor Manteuffel, this is what you did to my father, Captain Schuster. You killed him in cold blood. Schuster? You are his daughter? I was there when you murdered him. I had no idea. Maria, how you must've suffered. You were there too, you bastard, in the prison camp. I saw you walk by my father's body. No. I love you, Maria. Yes, I think you do. Well, you led me to him. Now I have you both. I'm your baby, your angel, aren't I? Look at your angel of death! Burn in hell, both of you! Most of the dreams I've ever had fade away, but this one, I'll never forget. The only thing real is the jungle. I wake up, and I know it's gonna be there.
