THE RENDEZVOUS Directed by Koichi Saito The express train for Aomori via Niigata and Akita is leaving soon. All aboard! Drunken husband stabbed to death Where are we now? You look better smiling. Excuse me, can you give me a light? Thank you. Would you like a cigarette? - Would you like one? - I don't smoke. You don't? So your right fingers aren't pale because of nicotine? Are you travelling together? Women of good breeding don't talk to strangers. I saw it in a foreign film. We know each other through matches. Can you talk with me? Am I bothering you? Are you mute? I'm sorry for you. Wait a minute. Just a moment. Here it comes. - Try to do it. - No. - It's a tunnel. - Mom! I won't do anything. Come here. Good girl! Come here. No! - Say something. - You're like a fool. It's a long journey. Hope it'll be enjoyable. Where are you going? You mustn't be deaf. You can hear me. It's a bother, talking to me? Are you a secondary-school teacher? Probably not. The next stop is Itoigawa. We're delayed, so standing time will be brief. Watch where you're going, you little punk ass! Hey, what were you caught for? Let me know. Kid, this isn't a show! Still act big after making a blunder? - What? - Hey, stop. - Alright. Let's have some. I don't like to eat alone. Leave that, if you don't like it. You don't eat? I will. So you can speak! I have no reason to receive food for free from a stranger. Thanks. You're decent. Oh, thanks. This is good, isn't it? Your hands are pretty dry. You must be a working girl, despite your appearance. You don't have to be ashamed. My mother had such hands, too. Her rough hands were always chapped and chilblained. She used to tell me to be careful of girls with thin, clean fingers. She said those hands deceived men, but I've always liked that type of girl. She was right. Is that seat occupied? - Is that seat occupied? - No, it's not. Grandmother, there's an empty seat here. Great. Can you help me? Should I put this up there? Thank you very much. Where are you going? I can't hear you. Where are you going? - Uetsu. - Uetsu? What a coincidence! Me, too! - Looks like you don't believe me. - Yes, I do. No, you don't. You suspect I'm just making conversation. Look at this. See? We're going to the same place by chance. It's like a drama. Uetsu. The express train will stop for about one minute. Hello, it's me. I've just arrived. How are things? Everyone's there? What? Not until tonight? No kidding. I told you that before. I had things to deal with. When, then? That's okay, I'll wait for you. Hey, can I come with you? I'm free until tonight. I'm afraid to walk alone in an unfamiliar city. Afraid? You? I just wanted to stimulate your maternal instincts! That old woman is travelling with you, just as I thought. Who is she? Why do you stay silent, again? Can't you tell me? She's keeping watch on me. Keeping watch? But you don't look like a sheltered girl. Perhaps you are planning to rob a bank? - She told you something about me? - No, she didn't. It's all right, because she trusts me. Thank you. Just a moment. Please let me borrow this. - Incense sticks still smell strong... - Wipe your tears first. ?Sumi Matsumiya?... Was she your mother? You weren't a good daughter. Can I pay my respects? I?ve disliked graveyards ever since childhood. I wasn't afraid of spirits or will-o'-the-wisps, but I?ve never liked them. Why did you come here with me? I never visited a grave before, so I was curious to do it once. How about your mother? She's dead, and I?ve never seen my father; I don't even know his name. But that's made me a strong fighter. You're really stuck-up. Or don't you trust anyone? I've been through many things in my 35 years. You've lived only 35 years and yet talk big. If humans don't trust each other, it'll be the end of the world. It'll be over for you, too. You're a human, right? I'm not anymore. I'm dead. - Can we meet tomorrow? - Tomorrow? Okay? No, I have to go back on the 3 p.m. train. Don't worry. Let's meet in the afternoon. I don't know your name yet. - You're Matsumiya... - Keiko. - Keiko? With a Chinese character? - Yes, it's this one. Wait a minute. - Is it the one meaning ?blessing?? - No, that's different. Different? The one for ?greeting?? No? The one that consists of two ?soils?? That Enka singer's name? There're other characters similar to it... I have no idea. Got it! The one used for ?celebration?? It's the ?Kei? of Keio University. - It means ?firefly?. - Firefly? - It's the Kei for fluorescent light. - That also means firefly? - Yes. Firefly... It's a lovely name. I like it. I like it, too. - Did your mother name you? - Yes, so I've heard. Your mother had a poetic sensibility. Are there still fireflies? I haven't seen any. I don't believe anymore... that there are fireflies in this world, either. Look, fireflies are glowing. Let's meet again tomorrow. I suppose you don't have the time today. And I've got something to do. Let's meet at the inn over there at noon. This is an automatic watch; no need to wind it. Take it with you. I'll be there without fail. Wait for me. At noon. - Are you Shinkichi Murai? - Yes. I've brought you a letter from Kayo. Kayo? I don't know anyone of that name. - You're mistaken. - No, she told me to give it to you. - Who are you? - I... I live in the same place as her. But... I don't have any idea who she is. Please leave. Please wait! Can you give me that letter? You want to give it to Kayo's husband, right? - Yes. - I'll give it to him, then. Come to my place tonight, will you? I'll draw a map for you. Excuse me. Welcome. Have you brought that letter? I'll give it to him. I knew that his wife was still alive. - Come here, you moron! - What? Let me go! It hurts! Do you have a message for Kayo? No, I don't! Welcome. Do you need a place to rest? - Yes. - This way, please. - Please. - It's all right here. You made a mess! We have a guest. Keep quiet. Hello, it's the Joshuya store. I?ve brought the sake you ordered. It's really cold today. You look even more attractive today. Had a good time with your husband? Can I take your order? - Three dozen bottles of beer. - Three dozen bottles... - And two bottles of sauce. - Two bottles of sauce... And mayonnaise. The big one. Tell him not to get too excited, or his blood pressure will go up. - You're getting carried away! - Thank you. Thank you. - Excuse me... Can I rent a room? - By yourself? - Welcome. - Was someone waiting for me? It's you. She asked me to give you this, because she had no time. Wait! I'm sorry. I got in trouble and was late. Let's go back there. You can take a later train. Hello again. Let's go back. You'd better not follow me anymore. Hey! Why? Are you angry? I want to make up for the lost three hours. Let's go back. You probably don't trust me. I mean it. Trust me. Please, I'm serious! Please. Let's go back. No, I can't. Because of that old woman? What did you do? How come someone is keeping watch on you? I wanted to hide it from you. I'm... a prisoner. I'm an exemplary prisoner, so the prison gave me special permission to visit my mother's grave. I have to get back to the prison before 8 a.m. tomorrow. I'm sorry. I used to live in a place like prison. If you're allowed out like this, you must be a first-class prisoner. There are no first-class prisoners. Shall we go and get a seat? You'll be comfortable this way. - You... - I'm with you again. What a coincidence! We understand that a lack of love was at the root of your crime. You were captivated by an illusion when you won your husband?s heart. Once your passion for him was fulfilled, you clung to the idea you should unite with him mentally and physically. After pleasure passed, you suffered a sense of emptiness, and committed the crime in order to escape your limitations as a woman. However, you've realised you're poor and lonely in the endless, barren world. We see it as grounds for leniency and sentence you to seven years in prison. This court is adjourned. The critically-injured man who was found by a patrolling policeman... on the warehouse street in Uetsu early this morning... turned out to be Hiroshi Takano, a yakuza of the Meisei-gumi. He's believed to be a member of the gang who robbed the Uetsu bank last night. The police suspect this was as a result of internal discord within the gang, and have conducted an investigation of the injury case, along with the robbery. I have a pain in my stomach. Maybe I drank too much coffee. I feel short of breath. I think I'll get some fresh air outside. - Will you come, too? - No. How about escaping? How about jumping off the train? Perhaps we could run away, if it goes well. One chance in a thousand. Will you try? Just kidding! You can't, because you're a first-class prisoner. I've never thought of escape, but... You ended up in prison by mistake. You shouldn't make the same mistake again. Why did you get on this train? Can I check your ticket? - Maybe it's in my coat? - Did you buy a ticket? I was in a hurry... Do you have a platform ticket? - A ticket to the last station, please. - Nagoya? Attention, please. This train will stop here for a while due to a landslide. We apologize for the inconvenience. We'll inform you about restarting as soon as we know the details. I'll go and see the conductor. We have to be back by 8 a.m. Let's go. Let's run away. Let's run away together. It'll go well. Let's run away. - Are you serious? - Of course. We'll go somewhere no one knows us, and we'll live together. We don't have to get married. I can pretend to be your younger brother or anything. I'll... work hard. Thank you. Even if the prisoner escaped, it's not up to me to search for her. Can't you call the police? I can at the station. The man must've encouraged her: she's not the type of woman to escape. Did they really run away? - Let's search the train again. - It's useless! It was wrong to give her the privileges. I opposed it. - It's because the train stopped here... - What could I do about that? What's the matter? They're in there? - I'm sorry. - That's okay. Attention, please. The train will re-start shortly. We apologize for the inconvenience. The next stop is Atumi. Oh, I'm sorry. Why, it's Mrs. Hara! Weren't you in Manchuria? I'm Yamamura. My father ran the Showa Milling Company in Mukden. It's you! You've grown! - How is your husband? - He's doing well. What do you do? - I'm an insurance salesman. - Insurance? - It's a good business, yes? - No, not that good. What's that scar? I got a disease after I was drafted into the army over there. I was sent to the army hospital in Hiroshima, and on 6th August... What a pity! Well, my friend's waiting for me. - Say hello to your mother. - Remember me to your husband. - Wait, take some oranges. - No, thanks. - Take them. - Okay, thanks. - Take care. - You, too. Hey, wait. Let's have some noodles. You still have time, right? Your body will warm up. Madam, I won't ask for anything more. It's okay if she's back before 8, isn't it? Please. Come on. - Give me three bowls of your best noodles! - The best? I was about to close up. You won't be able to have things like this for some time. Here you go. - How much? - 360 yen. Thanks. Thank you. Take care! You haven't told me your name yet. - I'm Akira Nakahara. - Akira Nakahara? Akira doesn't mean ?tomorrow?. - It's the one meaning ?cheerful?. - Cheerful? I'll be released in two years. Wait for me in that park in two years. In two years? Yes. Two years today. Promise to do so! Don't go away. Don't go away. Excuse me, please open up! I need warm clothes for a woman. - Please choose some for me. - Some warm clothes? - Is she a child? - No, an adult. These are wool products. These are underclothes. Scarfs are here. These are good. This one, too. And this scarf. There are polo-neck sweaters for ladies over there. Here. How much will it be altogether? And these, too. How much is it? That comes to... 5,340 yen. Thank you. Welcome. Here's your change, 4,660 yen. Thank you. Welcome, can I help you? - Akira Nakahara! - What are you doing? Don't resist! We have an arrest warrant. - Where's the money? - Let me go! Stand up! It hurts! - Hurry up. - Come here! I'm sorry for the trouble. We're police. - Stand up! - Let me go! We'll listen to your story at the police station. Stand up! Let me send things in to her! No, let me go! Let me send things in to her! No!
