Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name, Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done on Earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we... Hey Crystal. Hey, what's up, Lump? Ah, nothing much. Same old shit. How's business? Pretty dead. What have you been doing? Just skatin' around all day. Got a bad sunburn, though. Jesus, you better take better care of yourself. You need to wear long sleeves. I am now. Kinda too late. You could tell my fortune. Got a dollar? No. Can I borrow a dollar? I don't have a dollar. I can owe ya. You're fucked. Thanks. You see what this is? No. That's your best friend status going down. I didn't know I had a best friend status. For now. So what you doin' tonight? I don't know. Hang out in the park or something. You know, I saw this really cool place. It's a factory, a warehouse or something and I think it's abandoned 'cause I've been by it a couple of times and I've never seen anybody come in or out of it. It's kinda big and um, I don't know. I think it'd be fun. What is there to do there? I don't know. What's there to do in the park? Well, I mean, we could go check it out. Sure. Are you serious? Yeah, why not? Do you wanna go now? Yeah, yeah, let's go. Well, I don't know how we're gonna get in. I'm sure there's a way. So, he's like, what's your name? And I'm like, my friends call me Spaz and he goes well, what does your mother call you? And I said dude, my mother doesn't call me, but your mother calls me Sweet Dick William faggot cock sucker. So then what happened? And then what happened? Bam, KO baby, knocked his ass out. Left him bleeding on the floor. That's fuckin' ill! Why don't you tell her how that story ends? Dude, assaulting an officer, six months. That Crystal? Yo, Crystal! What's up, Crystal? How you doin' beautiful? What's up Lump? Hey, what's up Spaz? Hi Marcus. What's up Crystal? Those headaches any better? Comes and goes, you know. Crystal? Crystal this is Tammy. Tammy this is Crystal. Hi. Yeah, whatever. That's Lump. What's that shit on your neck? So where are you two headed? We're going to a... We're just going for a walk. I smell a coverup. Anybody else smell a coverup? Don't be an asshole. Who's being an asshole? I just asked them where they were going. I was just gonna take her to a place that I know. New place? you didn't invite us? Come on. Got some beer and Marcus has got some weed. Well. Alright, party at Lump's. Well, is that gonna be alright? I don't know, I just don't want too many people over there, you know? We're gonna get busted. Nobody's gonna get busted. Taco slappers. Hey Spaz. What's going on everybody? What's up, Crystal? Nothing much. What's up Liz? Share with your friend. What's going on, Melanie? So when are gonna drop this dike and take on a real man? Why? You know any? Shit, ask Liz. She knows what kinda meat I'm packing. In your dreams, needledick. Hey, when I get a hard on, I don't have enough skin left over to blink my eyes. Fuck, I thought it was a pube 'til I saw you taking a piss. Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, especially fuck you. Ugh. So where you going? Wondrous, isn't it? This is the place? Yeah. It's a fuckin' death trap. It's pretty freaky. I think it's cool. This is fucking awesome is what it is. So, how we gettin' in here, boss? Well, there's a window around back. I think we can get in there. We shouldn't go in there. Why not? I have a bad feeling. Come on, we've got whiskey, we've got beer. We got weed. Marcus, are you coming? So, what's the deal? We're gonna take this dumpster, put it underneath it, pile the shit on top and climb in. Sounds good. First things first, though, we need to take out this window. Okay, Liz, you go take lookout on that corner. Melanie, you go take lookout down there. What's wrong with you? I'm alright. Well, you don't look alright. Good shot, Lump. Hey, this bitch is freaking out. Five oh! Get up, we gotta go. We shouldn't go in there. Shh. Marcus, you got any shit on you? We shouldn't go in there! Is she alright? How the fuck should I know? She's still breathing. That fucking cop is gonna come back here again. Okay, so what are we gonna do now? We're going in. Crystal said we shouldn't go in there. We've got alcohol, drugs, a passed-out girl and there's a cop going around the block. What are we supposed to do? Okay, well, what about her? I'll go in first and find some rope or something and you can help me pull her up. Are you serious? Yeah. Crystal, wake up. Crystal, Crystal. Wake up Crystal. Are we inside yet? No shit. No you don't, no. Are you okay? Yeah. What's your problem? Why don't you just shut the fuck up? What? Shut the fuck up. Oh hell no. Hey guys. Come check this out. Are you sure you're okay? Yeah, I'm okay. You know, we should just go. Well, we're inside now. Well, what do you want to do? Come on, let's check the place out. It looks cool. Marcus! Are you coming? Yeah. What are you doing? We're gonna go exploring bwa ha ha ha. Oh, this is so cool. Oh, yeah. That last one, and then Monica said that Phillip's... They never wanted to have a kid. I don't know why they had one. Why? Phillip's going to leave. They never gave a crap about me. Why? 'Cause he's been drinking too much. But, whatever. I mean, I didn't give a crap about them either, so... You know he always used to drink a lot when he was around us... I just wanted to get out of there quick as I could. I left when I was 16. Well, how long are you going away for? No, no. One kid and my parents were done. So I ran into Andy the other day and he said that we could use his garage for practice. Oh, yeah? What are you looking at? No one, nothing. Why do you keep staring at Crystal? I am not staring at Crystal. So anyway, what about you? What about your folks? Well... My dad left when I was eight years old. Oh yeah? What happened? You know those headaches that I get? Yeah. Well... I saw how you two were dancing together. We were just having some fun. You could've joined us. Like I'd wanna join you. Why can't you just act like you're my girlfriend? I do act like I'm your girlfriend. Hey. What? You got any beer? No. I had a really bad feeling that something bad was going to happen to our neighbor, Mrs. Dixon, and when my mom came back, I told her and she didn't believe me. Hey, hey. You got any weed? No. Oh. Liz, I came here with you. I'm gonna leave here with you. Every time we go to a party, or we have a party... Oh, Jesus, not again. You just have to flirt with everyone else. It's really irritating. Dude, where's my fucking beer? Cock sucker, get lost man. Fuck you. Can't believe nobody has any fucking beer! Mrs. Dixon had died. She was strangled by her boyfriend. Everything kinda fell apart after that. Every time that I even hang out with anybody else you freak out. Why do have to flirt with Crystal? I just think she's a cool chick, that is all. Why don't you fuck her, then? Liz. Now every time I have a headache, I get really scared. Tonight was a fun night, right? Yeah. So far, at least. How you doin'? Alright, how are you? I'm good. Sick of this shit. What's up with Marcus and Crystal? How the hell should I know? Look at them. It's pretty disgusting. Yeah, that bitch needs to go back to the box she came from. Yeah, she's really dirty. Yeah, stank ass bitch. So, what's up with you and Melanie? Nothing. What's up with you and Marcus? Nothing going on anymore. Good. Fuck this. Fuck you. Yeah. Let's get outta here. Sounds good to me. Fuck you too, asshole. Oh, and honey, I hope you like a soft serve, 'cause he ain't got nothing but a fuckin' limp dick. You see? That's exactly what I'm talking about. You see what a bitch she is? Fucking bitch. Oh, shit. We should not have let her go downstairs by herself. She'll be fine. There's somebody in here with us. Who is totally passed out. Somebody else. You're not gonna start freaking out on me again, are you? No. Do you want to do this, or not? Yeah. Bonus. Shit. Where the fuck is it? Here we go. Liz? Is that you? Spaz, this isn't funny. Oh shit! Where are you going? I've got to go find Melanie. But I thought we... Would you hurry up? Everything is fine, okay? Just calm down. What the fuck is going on? It was fun. We heard Melanie scream. What the fuck is going on here? Where's Melanie? Where's Tammy? We heard her scream. She's downstairs, he's got her. We've got to find her. Who? Is Tammy in there? We've got to find her and get the hell outta here. What, somebody startin' trouble? Crystal's just fucked up again. Where's Tammy? Look. There's someone in here. He's got Melanie. We've gotta find her and get the hell outta here. What are you talking about? Where's Melanie? What are you guys doing in here? We have to find her. Ah! Fuck! What the hell's wrong with you, man? Alright. Let's go find Melanie. What's going on? Somebody tell me what's going on. What are we doing? They heard Melanie scream. Dude, it was probably a rat. She doesn't need all six of us looking for her. It wasn't a rat. Shh. Why are you shushing me in an empty warehouse? You trying to sneak up on Melanie and scare her? Melanie? Crystal. Crystal, you okay? Oh, now what's the problem? She's in there. Oh, hell no. Y'all are going with me, mother fuckers. This ain't no one man show. Get your ass over here. I'll be right back. Crystal? Yeah? I think we need to get out of here. That's what I've been saying. Come on, I can't carry you both. Move your ass, you fucking pussy. You know what, Spaz? You can kiss my ass. What the fuck? What the fuck? Hey, mother fucker. Ah! Who was that guy? Let's block in the fucking door. I think he's gone. What are we gonna do? You guys go find the cops. Marcus and I are gonna go get this fucker. Are you fucking crazy? Lump is still down there. He's fucking killing him down there. Fuck him! Fuck him? Fuck you! I'm not leaving anybody behind! Fuck, you're not opening this fucking door! You don't know what's going on down there! He could still be alive! I am not leaving anybody behind! We don't know what he's fucking doing to him! Call your friends down here. Fuck you! I'm not leaving any one of my friends down there! Blow! You don't know! Crystal! Spaz! Help me please. Get the fuck outta here. Go! Some friends you got there. Get the fuck off me. You listen to me, you pansy piece of shit. That cock sucker down there just killed two of our friends. You are gonna go with me and help nail his ass to the fucking wall. I told you to get the fuck outta here. We're not going anywhere. What are you talking about? Go see for yourself. What should we do? Shut up. Move! This is the same window? Of course this is the same fucking window. Mother fucking son of a bitch. Fuck! Crystal, what's going on? I don't know. Don't give me that shit. You know something. I don't know. But... I can find out. Something's coming. Hi, hello. Who are you? My name is Sally. I used to live here. Me and my mommy are just visiting. Yay. Is your name Crystal? Pretty. Yes. Daddy said I'm not supposed to talk to you. Please, tell me. What's happening here? A lot of bad things. I'm not supposed to talk about it. Secrets, but... I will. Bad girl. We used to live here. There was me, my mom, and my dad. I don't think my dad was very happy. He was mad all the time, and when he was mad, he'd always start yelling. Hey, what the hell you guys doing? It's a ten-minute goddamn job, you been working it 30 minutes. Now get those goddamn boxes off. Get 'em over there right now. What the fuck you want us to do? We only have two fucking hands, man, not four. We only have two fucking hands. What the fuck you want us to do? Who the hell do you think you're talking to? Don't you ever talk to me like that again. Don't you ever. Jesus Christ. He was only ever nice to a dog. Yes, there, that's my baby. My baby, baby, baby. Oh yes you are. But one day... Yes you are. Pappy ran away. There were these guys that worked for my dad. Mom said they were really nice. Can you two keep a secret? Yeah, what? Last night, me and... Mrs. Cleaver. Serious, I was like... Put that goddamn cigarette out. Can't you read the fuckin' sign? Daddy had to let them go. Mommy got upset. You are a fucking idiot. I cannot believe you fired those guys. You pussy. You let those guys go and you think you're gonna run this goddamn place by yourself. God, what an idiot! You're just gonna run it into the goddamn ground. What's gonna happen to your family then, huh? This is how you take care of your family? Sally and I are gonna be out on the goddamn street like beggars. Stop drinking! All you do is sit there and drink! That's all you do anymore, God! I don't know what we're gonna do, I don't know what we're gonna do because you are a goddamn loser and you never listen to me. You never goddamn listen. One day, the police came. Mr. Cleaver? Yeah, who are you? I'm Agent Hollis from the Health Department. I'm here to inspect the premises. You mind if I come in? Daddy did his best. He tried really hard to run the business all by himself, but no matter what he did, he couldn't get everything done. So he got in trouble. This is your B-12. This is your S-5. If you wanna appeal it, you can contact the people on those papers. You're not gonna stay for dinner! Fuckin' asshole. Mommy got upset again. What'd I fucking tell you? I told you not to fire those guys, didn't I? Now they shut your ass down. What are we supposed to do now, huh? You lost us our goddamn home. Where are we supposed to go, huh? Big man with all the answers, huh? What are we gonna eat? You got money to buy food? You don't, do you? God, what was I thinking? I'm taking Sally and I'm leaving you and this dump. Eh! What? Can we try to have a friendly conversation here? Oh, now you wanna talk. You haven't talked for years, okay, okay. I was doing my homework when it happened. I guess he was still mad. What's that smell? It's your mother. She's cooking. He put me in the freezer. He said he was saving me for dessert. That's what he always called it. So, he got in trouble again. Mr. Cleaver. I've had the honor of sittin' on this bench for some 12 years now and never in all that time have I presided over a case of such inhuman brutality, such wanton deviance, and because I find you to be devoid of even the slightest bit of remorse for your crimes and because you continue to prove yourself a threat even within the confines of prison, I feel that I have no choice but to sentence you to death by electrocution. May God have mercy on your soul. Court's adjourned. When we were done, me and Mommy went to a nice place, angels, but they said that Daddy couldn't come. They put him somewhere else. Somewhere bad. Fire. Daddy didn't like it there, and started a lot of trouble. They couldn't make him behave. Evil. They didn't want him there anymore, so they gave him his skin back, but there was nowhere else to put him, no place except one, back home. When they let him out, there was something they didn't tell him. He could have his skin, but he'd never be able to leave. He tried for a long time. What the hell am I doing with this stupid thing? But nothing worked. And after a while, he started to get hungry. Come here. Gotcha, you little bastard. Then there was nothing left to eat. He was so hungry that he tried to go back to the bad place... Oh fuck. But every time... He just came back here. When he knew he could never get out, he started to eat the only thing he had left. There isn't much of him anymore. And he gets hungrier every day. Hungry for all sorts of things. But now you and your friends are here, suffer. Please, can you help us get out of here? Can you help us? Nothing can help you now. And there is no way out of here. You should go now. I am gonna kill you, you fucking cock sucker. Let it go. Yeah, you better run away, bitch! Crystal's awake. Shit, I thought we lost you. What did I miss? Everything's fine. We're gonna get this guy. No, we're not! Shut up, we need to get out of here. Fine, you all stay here and I'll go knock this asshole out and then go get help. No you won't. Crystal. Look, I'm glad that you're okay, but I swear to God, if you give me any of your shit, I'll break your fucking jaw. This guy butchered his family. Got the chair. He's been trapped in here ever since. What do you think you're gonna do, Spaz? She's right. We can't fuck with this guy. Oh, Jesus. That's right, that's right, Crystal. Spaz, you're full of shit. You're not gonna do anything. Liz, pipe down. Liz, Melanie wanted you to have this. Goddammit! Open the door, you fucking pussy. I'm a fucking pussy? Come out, we'll see who the fucking pussy is! You're a dead man. You're a fucking dead man. Oh God, what is it? It's Lump's lump. Lump's lump? Lump's fucking lump. Son of a bitch, goddamn mother fucking, cunt piece of shit bastard! That is it! I am tired of fucking around with this asshole! You want a war? I'll give you a fucking war mother fucker! Bring it mother fucker! Bring it! It's hammer time. Spaz. Look. Either you guys help me take him down, or I will fucking kill you all. Are you ready? Marcus, are you ready? Uh huh. Spaz. Spaz! Are you ready? Get up. Get the fuck up. Oh hey, big man huh? Big scary mother fucker? Big man now? Yeah, you tell me. Big man, you killed Lump. You were a big man when you killed Liz. You were a big man when you fucking killed Melanie. Ah! Ah! He's not dead. Oh yeah? Well, he'll never dance again. Can we go? Okay. Ah! Crystal! Crystal! This is your fucking fault! You're the reason this is happening! You're. Hey! Hey, she's over here! She's over here! Let me go, let me go. Shut up! Fucking bitch. Tammy, Tammy. She went that way. Burn it down. This is all your fault! Crystal's gonna free us, Daddy! Now, don't do anything rash, sweetheart. What are you gonna do? You gonna kill me? I've died a hundred times. I'm still here. You know why? I don't give a shit. Because hell doesn't even want me. I keep going there, they keep sending me back here. They just can't handle me down there. Fuck you. No, fuck you. This is the place. Alright. How are we gonna get in? Dinner!
