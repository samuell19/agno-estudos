Martin! Hi! How are you doing? Great! Here, catch! I race you back to the house! Faster! Faster! - Felipe, what are you doing? - We're overloaded! Grandpa! Grandpa! That's it. Oh, Felipe, look at you! I beat you, didn't I, Dad? Hot Spur wins again! - Auntie Ana! - We're here! Laura, my goodness, I don't believe it! Look how you've grown! How are your parents? - Hey, Grandpa! - Daniel! It's so good to see you again! - How are you? - I'm fine. Felipe! Grandpa! One, two... Three! A little monkey, you weight a ton! - How did you get like that? - I don't know, I just can't help! Grandpa! I've missed you a lot. How is my little bunny rabbit? Damasia! Look what I've brought you. Thank you! That's not all! I scored the most goals! And at the club, I was champion in tennis, and in swimming! Champion mess maker. Did you see these? - They're great. - Sure, they're my dad's. You know, I thought we'd never get here. I was sure we were gonna miss the train. And whose fault was that? - Why can't you be careful?! - I'm sorry, I wasn't looking! Look. The cup we won in junior polo. I was the captain of our team. - My mom had her baby. - Oh, yeah? Was it a boy? - No, a girl. - Oh. And how did you name her? Rosa. And she's already five months old. Can I have a little kiss? I can't find my sack! Felipe! Look at this. They were almost too big for me last year! I'm really glad you're here. So am I. I haven't played this game for a long time. The sky is just as clear as day. Look, a shooting star! There's another one! What was your wish? Tell me yours first. That I will never go back to school again. And then I'll be able to stay here forever. I wished I could take him home with me. You know Dad won't let you do that. I don't care. I still wished I could anyway. And you, you made a wish too, didn't you? The same wish that I did! And me... I wish I could travel. All around the world, with the people I love. And you? Well, it was... that nothing will ever change. Easy, now. Easy... I just want you to get used to it. I don't want to mount you until you're ready. - Good morning, Daniel. - Good morning! Lovely day. Hello, Damasia. Morning. - What is his name gonna be? - Daniel. Is Martin here? He won't be very long. Come and sit down. Now, then tell me how did your year go. Fine. How was school? You thirsty? Would you like something to drink? Yeah, sure. It's hot. I'll go get you some juice. Hello! Put your hand there, like that. Let go of my finger! Come on, let go! She won't let it go! She will, wait a sec. Look at that! See what your big brother brought you? Come on, let's go. Okay. Go to sleep now. Get ready... Get set! Go! Good one! Attaboy, Martin! Great! Hi! Hi. - What's my time? - One minute, fifty-three seconds. Great! - One more time? - Go ahead. - Who's winning? - We're about even. But Daniel's made the best time so far! Since his brother's the timekeeper, it's no wonder. Watch it! As long as I'm here, I'm bigger than you. He said that I was cheating! You're a bad loser. You shouldn't talk! When you'll run the whole course from one end to the other, then you can talk. How about it? No way. I wouldn't want to put you to shame! - Are you ready or not? - Sure. Get ready! Get set... Go! Yeah, Martin! Hey, Felipe! Catch anything yet? - No, they're not biting. - Why not? 'Cause they're making too much noise! It scares them away. - It's all over! - Look! It's a boy, right? I've never seen a horse like that. He's the one I want. Daniel... Yeah, I want him for myself. He's beautiful! Federico! If you're tough enough to break him in, he's yours! Thanks a lot! Will you let Martin choose one for himself too? Same as always! The two of you stick together! He can have one! The one who rides his horse first wins. You won't get me down, you hear? I can break him in. I'll be riding him in a month. Be quiet! Oh, wow! Here we are! Thank you very much. He was in a herd of horses that my grandfather bought that summer. What was he like? Black as coal. With a white star on his forehead. A magnificent horse. How old were you then? I was your age. The first in my life that I'd broken in a horse all alone. And I hadn't picked a gentle horse either. He was really temperamental! And what were you like? He was just like the horse! - No doubt. Thank you. - What did you name your horse? Vulcan. That's a peculiar name. The Roman god of fire. Yes, that's it. Exactly. But at first... - he was afraid of you. - No, no, no. There was nothing he was afraid of. Not even me. But once I was able to ride him, you couldn't keep us apart. Then you had him a long time? - One summer. - What happened? There was an accident. And his foot was broken so we had to sacrifice him. No way you could fix it? No. He suffered too much. Isabelle had an accident and broke her foot too. She's my friend from school. But she got it fixed. Goodbye. Felipe! You can wait until I'm done! Felipe, get out of there! I'll get out when I'm all through! Hurry up! Felipe, I haven't got all day! - What's going on? - Felipe has locked himself in the bath! - Well, you could try the other one. - I left my things in there! You're going to begin this morning? - Yeah. - Looking forward to it? - I think you should watch it. - Don't worry about me. I wasn't talking about the horse. I don't believe this! Laura! I was here before you! Martin! I'm gonna call him "Fierro"! - Let's go, come on! - I have to work on this saddle. I can help you with it afterwards. Come on, I can't wait to see him again! And you have to choose one for yourself too! I didn't see you there. Sit down. I like it when you comb my hair. I can't believe how quickly you've changed. You know, you're even prettier than last year. I've grown up. And... Well, I got my period. That's what I thought. Daddy talked to me about Grandma. He didn't know her all that well. - Do you remember her? - Yes, of course. Grandpa never talks of her. There are scars which never do disappear. Shall I braid it like that? No, thank you. I wish I'd known her. Now it's your turn to pick one. - Go ahead and choose. - No, not right now. You recognize me, heh? See that? You shouldn't give him so much. He'll be sick. It's okay. Daniel, stop it. Be quiet, Martin! He belongs to me! - Hello. - Hello. - Can I help you? - No, thank you. May I look? You may take it with you if you like. Did you enjoy it? Very much. That was his finest book. - Laura. - Yes? Close the door. What's this? I'm the one who's supposed to find you. I wish we could change the story once in a while. - Why? - Watch! I arrive on the island. I go into the woods... I walk... And walk... across the rivers... and over the mountains... I keep walking. One day, I discover footprints. I follow them. And they lead to an enormous castle... where you are hiding. - I come closer to you... - Felipe. Don't forget: I save you. But why must I always be stuck with Friday? That's disgusting! At least it works. When I get older, I'm gonna write a book of my own. "The musketeers of the Pampas". What's that gonna be about? Why does Grandpa get so annoyed if we come here? It's not dangerous. Hey, you about finished?! All right. We'll be counting on you. Yeah, sure. We'll be there. - Bye! - At the match. Did you play a lot this year? Yeah, now and then. - Who are they? - We're gonna play in a pato team with them Sunday. - What are you doing? - Practicing. Well, practice with me then! Catch me if you can! On the first try, huh? Thank you. That's what you've had your eye on, isn't it? Yeah. How do you know that? It wasn't as difficult as you think. Did you get it from your father? No. Not this one. This is one that I found in an antique store one day, when I was a student at the university. Who owned it before you? I don't know. I haven't tried to imagine whose it was, but... I bet you that it was a bandit... or an outlaw who had it. Why not? Why not? It's a wonderful present. Thanks a lot. I wouldn't think of giving it to anyone but you. To break in a horse for the first time is a very important thing in your life. Now, then run along to bed. I hope you sleep well. You too, Grandpa. Good night. She woke up. You were sleeping, I didn't want to bother you. And you? I wasn't sleeping. She looks so peaceful. Nothing seems to bother her at all. Mom? Is it because of Daniel? Yes. I'm to blame too. We both are. Half the time I really like Daniel, and some days I don't even want him around. You know what I mean? Yes. You look nice like that. You see, you can be nice. We're going to do a lot of things together. I'm going to come and see you every day. You and me, we'll go everywhere. You're mine now. Don't be afraid. Nobody's gonna harm you. Cut it out! That's because of you they're afraid. - What are you up to? - I fell down. - Are you hurt? - No. It's nothing. Felipe, look at this. These were Dad's when he was younger. Diego reads mathematics. Grade 2. Hey, look at this! There's a letter. "My dear Diego. "I miss you very much. "Although I enjoy Paris, not even its bright lights "can make me forget how far I am from you. "But very soon, we're going to be together. "Till then, a thousand kisses from your Mommy to tell you that she loves you." Keep up the lasso! Keep it up! You want them to break in Fierro? No. I can break him in alone. Hold him, hold him! Tie it, tie it off! "Did you know, Isabelle, "that the Indians had never seen a horse before? "But it didn't take them very long "to get to understand horses. "The Indians were very good with horses. "They never mistreated them. "They caressed them, they fed them with their own hands. "The Indians, they knew "how to respect horses." Get that horse away. Can't you see they're making him nervous? - I can do it myself! - I know that. I just wanted to help. - Why are you crying? - Because I'm mad! What are you mad about? Because I'm crying! That's okay. It doesn't matter. I'm okay now. It sure is hot. - Is that all right? - Just perfect. You're a master of the outdoor grill. Which character from The Jungle Book do you like? Shere Khan. Here, you want some? - Guess which one I like best. - Who? Baloo... Baloo! - When you were in Paris-- - I was never in Paris. - You were never in Paris? - No, never. I fell asleep. What are you doing in my room? I want to talk to you. Go to your room. It's late now. Good night. Good night. You'd like me more if I were a boy? Wouldn't you? Felipe! You'd better watch it, I'm bigger than you-- Come on, hurry up. - Where are you going? - Why don't you stay in bed? - Wait for me. - You stay out of it. This is just for us guys. What's he trying to do? He's trying to win the bet! How come? It's simple. We said the first one to mount his horse! He secretly chose the horse he wanted to team, and he's breaking him in! I can't wait to see his face! See? I told you. Here. Give 'em to me. Daniel... - What's the matter? - None of your business! - What have you done? - It's none of your business! Your stew tastes a lot better than Mom's does. Is that so? You better not tell her that! I already did. Bravo. I hope that you're proud of yourself. Daniel. It's me. I want to talk to you. - Hey, you're coming or not? - Some other time. - But you'll miss a great match, you know? - No. I would just rather stay here. I don't understand why you did such a thing. I think you did it on purpose to infuriate him like that. He's been that way since I got here. Why doesn't he treat me like he used to? Laura... You must be patient. You won't get anywhere by defying him. Go on. Go and get me the scissors. But why? I got it! Why aren't they playing in the same team? I don't know... Bravo, Martin! Bravo, Mario! You don't! Score! Tired? No. I'm fine. A pretty close game, huh? Yeah. You really gave it the works, huh? It's the only way. Are you sure of it, son? Life's a drag. I thought you were sleeping! How come you're not in bed? I forgot to brush my teeth. Do you know why a monkey thinks it's silly to peel a banana? No. Because he knows what's inside! Come here. Come. Do you know the story of the whale? - No. - No? How come you don't know? How come you don't know it? Now you know it! How do you do that? - Show me! - Like this. See? Hop! No! Like this! You see? Come on, now. That's enough. It's time for bed. - Good night. - Night. You have no right to let anyone else mount you! You're mine! Come on! Daniel... Get out of here! Get out! Can I talk to you? It's not the proper time. I need to talk to you. We're not through yet. You stay right there. Grandpa! Grandpa! - I'll come with you. - No! There's no need. Now, don't worry. I'll call you from town. - Are you feeling better now? - Yes. Yeah. I'm glad I didn't have to stay in the hospital. You had me worried, you know? It wasn't so bad. It's a good thing you have a hard head. I guess it runs in the family! Here we are. That's where it is. Where I grew up. It would never have occurred to me that I could live anywhere else. When I was a child, I thought that no one could ever suffer in such a place. I've never understood why your father chose to earn his living as a designer... He liked doing it. Yes, no doubt. I was just thinking of the first time you came here. I guess you were... three, four years old. And one night you disappeared. Then we looked everywhere. And finally, we found you playing in the stall of Apollo! He's the horse that I was riding that summer. And that was when I knew... that all of this was really meant for you someday. Well, meant for you as well as for your children. Daniel? What? Are you awake? What is it? Do you know what a hero is? A hero? A person that everyone likes, because he always wins. Do you think any people in real life are like that? I don't know. Must get boring. Can I sleep in here with you? Makes you look younger. You look pretty good that way. You want to know something, Laura? I didn't think you had the nerve to do that. Neither did I. I hate to think what Mama will say when she sees this too. Have you heard from Isabelle? Yes. We're still writing to each other. You still like her? Sure I do. Oh! Felipe! How are you feeling now? I'm fine. Does it still hurt a lot? I wish that I could... - I don't know what to tell you. - It's okay. You're still mad, aren't you? Yeah. I suppose I'd still be mad too if I were you. But why didn't you say anything? I started breaking him in long before you got here. I figured don Federico would let me have him, that you would choose another horse and tame that one. But when I saw him that day at the river, why didn't you say anything? I tried to. - But you were acting like a... - Yeah, I know. What would you have done? I won't ride him anymore, Daniel. I guess I should have known from the start that somebody was breaking him in. Hi there. She's cute! I swear I didn't tell anyone. Now, Felipe, you tell me. - What did you dream last night? - I don't ever dream at night. You don't? 'Cause I dream all day! - Good morning, Federico. - Good morning. - Is it from her? - Yes. How is our patient getting on? Fine. Better. They went out to get Fierro. Because I think it's simpler for you to work with him here. Right now it's important you rest. Tomorrow you can begin again. I won't be riding him tomorrow. That's fine, you take all the time you want. I don't want to ride him again. What did you say? I will never ride him again. On account of the accident? No, it's not that. Then what is it? - That horse wasn't meant for me. - But that's the horse you chose! After having said the things you did in front of everyone, you can't go back on all that. No, not you. What is it, are you afraid? No, it's not that I'm afraid. Well, all right if it's not fear! What is it? Cowardice? Federico! You wouldn't understand! I did try! Yes! But at the first obstacle you just gave up like that! He's not the right horse for me! And so what? That's too easy. No. No, it's not easy. I am very disappointed, Daniel. - Very disappointed in you. - You have no right to say that! You don't even know what happened! When I'll want your opinion, then I'll ask for it! Please, Federico! Calm down! It's silly to make a scene-- Sorry, but I'm talking to Daniel. Now, look, Daniel. You either assert yourself, or you submit. You've no other choice. You are the one that's not giving him a choice! I refuse to permit any grandson of mine to admit defeat! Listen to me! Do you have any idea what you're doing?! You break everything! You destroy everything! You love us the way you love your horses! On the condition that we obey and do what you want! What about us?! What about what we want?! You refuse to see any of that! Every time I really need to talk to you, you go away! We could be so happy! But not you! You don't want to be happy! I don't know why you are the way you are, but I can't stand it anymore! I've had enough. I will not put up with anymore of this. You're going home in the morning, and I forbid you to leave your room in the meantime. - Go back to Buenos Aires. - Like Grandma. We'll have to have a talk, young man. - What are you doing?! - Letting him go! Daniel, stop that! I don't want to ride him anymore! I know you love that horse. You love him too. Daniel, if you don't ride him, we'll never be the same, me and you. You went too fast, that's all. But you'll see. I'll show you how to do it. No one has to show me anything, especially you! Daniel! It's time to eat. Is Grandpa there? Yeah. He just got home. Laura, time to eat. Where's Laura? She said she's not hungry now. I don't believe it. She's gone without eating the whole day... Have you thought it over? Yes. Have you reconsidered? No. Let me have your sister's plate, will you? No one's got to know! No! No! No-- Felipe, just what's going on? Laura ran away. She's only hiding. Don't worry, she'll come back. - I'll go with you. - No. Wait for me here. Good luck. - Where are you going? - To ask Luis. You'll do no such thing. This is a family affair. Then let's see you do something. What are you afraid of? There's no fool like an old fool, is there? There are days when I would gladly give you a boot in the hind end. Remember that I've witnessed a good many things in your life too. And one thing about you has always saddened me: that you were never willing to admit that inside, you were suffering too. How often I would've liked to cry out to tell you how terribly wrong you were? There's a few who needed to be told... Laura? Laura! Laura! Laura! - Where are they gone? - I can show you. I think we should go by truck though. I'll wait for you then. Make sure you cover up enough. Just tell me. Are they at the ruins? Yes, they are. But don't worry about it. - Where are we going? - To the ruins. Daniel! Come on! That's all we need. Now... Come on! Come on. Come on, Grandpa. Now tell me what's wrong, Laura. I want you to tell me why you don't love me anymore. I want you to love me. Whenever I come near you, you go away as if I had the plague. What have I done? What have I done to you? Tell me. Please. It's not your fault. It has nothing to do with you. Long ago... A long time ago, I loved a woman. And I was very, very much in love with her. She was beautiful. And she was in love with me... But... she needed to have space. To have her freedom. I didn't see it. Or I chose not to see it. I was jealous of her. Possessive... And I asked too much of her. As I did of you. One day she left me. It hurt me very deeply. It hurt so much I set fire to this house, the very house I had built for her. I worked like a fool hoping to forget her. Two years later, she was dead. Was that Grandma? Every time I looked at you, I saw her. I see you walking and laughing... and I saw her in your walk, heard her in your laugh. And I was afraid... And now? I don't know. You know we love you a lot. I know that. I know... - You all right? - Yeah. Can we walk back? I'll catch up with you. Why don't you ride him now? Maybe later. You ride him now. I'd rather walk back with you guys.
