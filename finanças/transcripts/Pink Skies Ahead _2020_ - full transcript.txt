Did you live with your parents at 20? No. I want to stick a fork in an electrical socket every minute that I am there. Are you OK? I mean, college was such a letdown. I wrote one poem from the point of view of a man who was fired from his job for never flushing his shits in the office bathroom, and my whole class turned on me. I couldn't take it. Kind of sounds funny. Do you know what one professor told us? That 90% of writing success was persistence and 10% was talent. What kind of bullshit is that? Stop. What? OK, don't stop. You ran a stop sign. I did? That's an auto fail, right? Yes, Winona, it is. Fuck. Why can I never pass this thing? How come everybody else in the world can talk and drive and I can't? What is wrong with me? I am a writer. I write to make sense of my world. I'm not normal, but I want to be. I don't think normal is boring. I think it's the act of making decisions that don't jar you or those around you. My mom says I didn't like to be held when I was a baby. I'd cry if I was cuddled, but if she put me down, I was happy. To me, this is proof that I came into this world not normal. I'm sorry this pasta didn't turn out great. It's good, Mom. Not really. I'm sorry. Mom, it's totally fine. How was your day, Pamela? Oh, I'm fine, Robert. It was fantastic. Thank you for asking. I taught my yoga class, and then I went to the market, and I forgot the parsley. So I asked you to get the parsley, and then you forgot. How was your day? What did you do? I sat in my office for eight hours then forgot to get your parsley. Oh, let me see it. What? Your license. Oh, I got you a chauffeur's hat. Is there a name for that kind of hat? You got me a hat? Scally cap. It's out in the car. Let me see the picture. I hope you did not wear that shirt. It doesn't do your complexion any justice, sweetheart. I've always told you no yellow. I failed. But I can still drive Dad on my learner's permit. Again? Are they even going to let you take the class again? You still have to wear the hat. May I be excused? No, actually, you can't, honey. There's something your dad and I want to discuss with you. We do, now? Yes, now. Can we talk later? Well, it's sort of a dinner discussion. Another dinner? I have stuff to do in my room. Oh, OK. Well, would you like to take some wine back to your room? I'm good. Thanks. OK. Really? Just till I get bored with it. Great. Doing any writing? I don't have enough life experience to write anything yet. I have to live first, Dad. I live, and then I get the material. When I was your age, I sold the car my dad gave me and went around the world. Sat in a two seater plane over Sri Lanka with a smuggler... And killed a pig with a knife. I know, Dad. This is the only story you ever tell me. It's worth telling. I shouldn't be talking and driving. It's making me nervous. Don't tell your mom. I won't. I think you should still take writing classes though, like night classes, just to feed your brain. You have a good one. I don't want to waste money on school when I can just do it on my own. I agree with Addie. I believe in higher education. You believe in aliens, Cameron. And aliens believe in you. Are you still dating Chris? Ha, no. I refuse to date guys in bands anymore. Are you dating anyone? This guy Frank. What's he do? He's in a band, but we are not serious. Oh my God, my armpit is so fucking sore. That's a gland. You should get that shit checked out. What? Yeah, like, for real. Like, ASAP. Hey, you want some wine? Oh my God, and my mom kept offering me wine last night. She's unbearable. Oh my God, your parents love you, like a lot. I'm a terrible person when I'm around them. Can I live with you guys? I'll clean. OK. She can stay. Mom? She's teaching yoga. Were you sleep? Nope, just, you know, seen this one. I have to go see Dr. Cotton in the morning, is that OK? You feel sick? Yeah, a little. It's personal. Oh. I just don't want to take advantage because you're my boss. Oh, you got to... no, you should go. You should go. No problem. You want to... I'm going to go to bed. Thanks, though. Night. OK, I'm just checking. You know that you're an adult, and I'm a pediatrician. I don't want a new doctor. I don't trust anybody else. I can't get a new doctor. Human adults are monsters. That's why I work with children. I pinky swear this is the last time. I do not trust that pinky since you said that three years ago. OK, so, what's up? My armpit. Just this one. Let's take a look. OK. It's been really sore for a week. Maybe a few weeks. I may have initially noticed it a month ago. Really? I don't feel a lump, but I'm fully prepared to biopsy. Do you remember when you were 7, you came in here with an ulcer? My second grade teacher that year was a terrifying French Canadian. She hated me. And then when you were 11, you came in, Doctor, I have breast cancer. I feel bumps on my chest, and they were just your breasts being breasts growing. Yes. All right, well, I am so sorry that I cannot make this, your underarm soreness, anything as spectacular as breasts. That was wizards work. Oh, look at this. I forgot. You quit the swimming team because you didn't want to get a yeast infection in your ear. Valid. You wouldn't sit on toilet seats because you didn't want to get a genital wart. And I listened to you, and I use the toilet seat covers and I never got genital warts. And that's why they call me Super Doctor. Do you know what is really, really interesting, Winona. All the elements that you have brought me over the years, there is one constant. Me. Two constants. You and your worry, and your worry manifests itself in ailments. So we're going to take your blood, we're going to send it to the lab, we're going to get results. But in my humble opinion, you have an anxiety disorder. Whoa. I don't have that. I have a good friend. She's a therapist. I'm going to get you a referral. Oh my God, I need a therapist? Anxiety disorder. I've never had a panic attack. I'm not built of that stuff. What do they think I'm going to do, Sylvia Plath myself? So I went to the doctor today. Yeah. I'm good. I'm fine right now. Right. Hey. Natural fucking driver. Sorry, Mr. Lendale. It's fine, Stephanie. You're not little Stephanie from the fourth grade anymore. I say fuck. Cool. Dad, can you tell Mom I left with Steph? Ciao. Bye. Hey, Kevin. It's Thomas. You always buy candy. Bet you smell like candy. Shut up, Kevin. What you guys up to tonight? Me and Stephanie are just going to our look out. You better hurry up. Why? Because it's going to get dark. Just ring me up, Kevin. Stop freaking me out. My doctor said that I have this anxiety thing. Because your mom is so overbearing? He didn't say why. He just said that the armpit soreness was part of my anxiety disorder. You don't have an anxiety disorder. You're super chill. That's what I said. I've never had a panic attack. Like you're high strung. I am? Yeah. I don't think you're fucked up. Did you steal all of that? You're insane. If it's food, it's not stealing. Pass me a donut. Hit me, Sergeant. How much longer are we going to be here? Uh, we just got here. You should have eaten first. You want us all to leave because you're hungry? There's some street meat outside that smelled pretty good. I think I'm going to get that. You down? Yep. Bye. There are so many cute guys here. A lot of guys with neck tattoos on my neck. I'm not being judgmental. I live with a guy who owns 60 Buddhas, but a neck tattoo? If you have to date someone, you should date someone like sweater vest gentleman. Oh, you're like my mom wanting to set me up with Matt Lauer. Hey, what's up? How much. What about you? Scram. Now. Go. Maybe I should go talk to those normal guys. Yeah. Hi. Where'd you come from? If I got a tequila, would you like some? Are you offering to buy me a drink? Sounds like it. Addie, Stephanie. I'm Winona. I am Ben. Pleasure to meet you, Ben. Pleasure to meet thee. We should go, my love. You have work tomorrow. OK, come on, I'm fine. Aren't you worried Frank is going to see you with this guy? Frank left for food and didn't come back. Well, I'm going to go. OK, I'm gonna come. I want to get a freezer. I'm going to give you my number. Bye. Stephanie, I got your shit, let's go. Bye. For breakfast? It's what Joan Didion eats. Joan Didion is a skeleton. Mom, can I have the day off work today or something? Honey, come sit down here. Your dad and I have something to discuss with you. Well... Look, I'm sorry all, but I'm not going back to school. We're downsizing. We're selling the house. What? I tried to tell you the other day, honey, but you just rushed out. It was your dad's idea, but it was a good one. He's right. We don't need this whole house. We were going to get an apartment and travel. Who lives in an apartment in LA? You can't get rid of this house for an apartment. We'll have a valet and services at the apartment. We're listing in a few weeks, so we need to start packing now. I don't want to move. I'm going to squat here if you do this. Winona, we made the decision before you came home. You weren't going to involve me in any of us? You're an adult, we thought you had moved out. Got it. They say they want to travel and have valet and services, as though those things are better than our home. Margaret Atwood wrote, better never means better for everyone. It always means worse for some. I have been designated the some. Lendale Contracting. Ah, lovely Winona? - Hi. - Hi. Hello. Dr. Cotton here. How are you? I'm good. I'm great. I couldn't feel better actually. Good. Good. Well, I have some great news for you. Your blood work came back. But I actually have cancer and not an anxiety disorder? No, no, no. I said I have really good news for you. Your blood work came back and it's perfect. I'm so sorry. So? Oh, so I really need you to go to that therapist. I really believe that a lot of your stress will be relieved if you go to talk therapy. I didn't call yet, but I will. I promise I am going to call. I'm so sorry. I have to go. Thank you for calling. Bye. Bye. Win? Win? Mom, it's Saturday. I don't have to work today. I know, but since you didn't go out last night, I thought maybe you'd have the energy to come to the studio with me for the art showing. Thank you. Namaste. Honey, isn't it amazing all the great artists there are in the world who will never be revered for their work? And Gauguin is overrated. Gorgan is overrated? Gauguin. Gauguin. Yes, Gauguin. I mean, absolutely. He's a cynicist. Right. Oh. Aren't you just inspired by art? I mean, absolutely not by Gauguin. Have you been feeling inspired lately? What? Since you left school. School didn't inspire me. Well, it didn't inspire me either, Win, but I was in nursing school sticking needles in people's arms, and I wasn't in a writing program. That program stifled me. How so? I don't want to talk about this. It's done. OK, move on. All right. How's working with your dad? Dad? Mm-hmm. Good. He works a lot. Yeah, I mean, he runs the company. So it's all good? Mm-hmm. Do you want some candy? Win, why do you eat candy like that? Why do you eat it like that all clumped up together? Why are you pulling that face? This is candy. It's disgusting. It looks like poop. It's not funny. Pamela. Don't call me Pamela. My parents are selling the house. Houses are for losers. Where are they moving? We are downsizing to some weird apartment or condo. What is the difference? I don't know. Fruit or Cola? What? Are you fruit or Cola? Cola. Thought so. What? You, my lady, are addicted to the escape of sexy men. She is. Cool it, Kevin. You literally flirt with everybody. It's out of control. I was being polite. I was not flirting. Can't we be polite to strangers? No, that was absolutely not. That was a huge flirt. Why is everyone on my dick? You just always have your feelers out and you don't need to. You could be alone, you know? I like having a boyfriend. I've always had a boyfriend. I like having someone to eat with, to watch TV, to eat candy with. Babe, you're at a crisis point in your life. No, I'm not. Have you called the therapist yet? You really think I'm fucked up, don't you? No. I really don't. I just don't like seeing you stagnate. I'm not stagnating. Where have you been looking for real jobs? You should be looking for jobs. You should be writing, and now I will shut up. Oh my God. - You OK? - I'm OK. I got air. I'm freaking out. Jesus. OK, I will call a therapist. I will go next week. That was a sign from God herself. I just about died right there. I'm sweating. You should talk to the therapist about this. Oh my God. Oh, no, I can't have more. Oh. This is one of those moments. I can't feel my hands. I didn't really want to come here, then I choked on a freezer and realized life was short. Does everyone cry? Some people do. Some people don't. Have had any recent changes in your life? I quit school. I moved back home, started working for my dad doing this fake chauffeur and filing job. How does that make you feel? Fine. Why are you laughing? You just said, how does that make you feel? Like, so cliche. But do you know how you feel? All I know is that I thought I would be normal, like all those kids who go to school and love it so much. I just didn't. I wasn't Felicity at all. Can we get down to it, Doctor Therapist Woman. I don't think I have this anxiety thing. Well, Dr. Cotton seem to think you do, and he's been your doctor your entire life. Why don't you think he's right? I've never had a panic attack. I'm just, I'm fine. But since I'm here, I want to tell you my deepest, darkest secret. OK. I get that people my age are generally pretty awful, but I honestly feel like I could be a better person. My deepest, darkest secret is that I think I'm an asshole. It's like, I live by instinct, but, man, my instincts aren't the greatest. So you want to talk about your parents? They're supportive. What about your relationship with your mom? Tell me about her. My mom? Um, she's like, she's like a really good person. Take your time. I'm sorry. I'm just... is it OK if I just do this for the rest of the session? Yeah. Did you guess I was going to be a crier? Yes. Winona, phone's for you. OK. Hello? Hey, Winona? Yeah. It's Ben from the bar the other night. Oh, hi. Hey. I was wondering. I know it's last minute, and you probably can't go, but I was wondering if you wanted to get a nice dinner. Yes. Hell, yes. You ready to order? Yeah. You go first. OK, I will have the olive plate, beet salad to start, then I will have the New York strip, baked potato, no sour cream, and do you have some kind of charcuterie thing to start to with the olives? Yes. You like meat? Yeah. Fantastic. We will get the charcuterie meat, too. How do you like your steak prepared? Rare, please. Rear, you carnivore. Better you know now, sir. You know what, I'm just going to have the same, minus all the starters, which I think we can share. Beet salad and medium steak, please. Thank you. So. Your friends seem nice, Addie and Stephanie. I have known Stephanie since the fourth grade. I'm an only child. My parents had me late in life, me and Steph are basically like sisters. We met when we both got sent out in the hallway for talking in class. Oh my God, I was always sent to the hallway for talking in class. Like, let kids flourish, you know? Yeah, seriously. What does Stephanie do? She works in a coffee shop, and Addie, I met her in my video store. She was the clerk. She's the coolest. She and her boyfriend, Cameron, don't work because he got in his car accident as a kid and got a ton of money. Wow. Yeah, like crazy fuck you money. Man, some people are so lucky. I've actually never been here before. I think it opened after I went to college. When did you graduate? Oh, I didn't. I left. I hated it. Oh. I'm getting my PhD actually. Two ships passing in the night. PhD, well, that's impressive. No. It's philosophy, so. That sounds... Boring. Well, I wasn't going to say boring, maybe abstract? Oh, how so? Discussing thoughts and ideas all day must be exhausting. I ordered a lot of food, huh? I guess I got you on a hungry day. Why did you leave school? I just didn't feel like I needed school to be a writer. I am the Coke. He is the red wine. PhDs drink red wine. Thank you. You have to look me in the eye when we cheers. OK. I'm only saying that because I don't know what else to say. You are funny. Thanks, Doc. It's good. This is so fucking good. This is the perfect Sunday drink. Kevin, this is the perfect Sunday drink. Is it Sunday? Oh my God, Kevin. Ben sounds boring. His fine. He's nice. What character from friends is he? A less funny Ross. Fuck, man, no. But it's kind of nice. I'm so used to guys who are just tough and aloof. He makes me feel relaxed. Sounds like a boring fucking date. He wouldn't leave me at a bar for food and not come back. He is a safe distraction. I have a better one. Want to do mushrooms? I have some. OK. These are really strong. Yep. It's great. We can't go anywhere. No, because we can't leave this blanket. See the edges? There is no oxygen beyond them. We're trapped on this blanket. You're right. There is half a burger left. We have to save it. That is all that we have left. This is all the food we have left in this world. I can see all of the pores on your face. You are so beautiful. Stephanie? Yeah. What if I can't write? You can write. You got into your writing program out of thousands of applicants because you're a great writer. I don't feel like writing anything. I literally have nothing to write. So? God, why do mushrooms make you think about yourself so much? Hair is some weird. Stephanie? Stephanie? OK. Yeah? Ben, it's Winona. Hey. I want to see you again. I had fun with you. I like you. I like you, too. My roommate's hosting a party for her mom here tonight, but you could come over and we can hide out in my room. Hey. How's it going? Yeah, good. Yeah? Here, come here. Winona, this is Jen. Jen, Winona. Hi. Hi. So you're having a party for your mom? Yeah. Cool. You and Ben are roommates? Yep. Cool. I think we're just going to go hang out in my room. Did you used to date her or something? How did you know? I mean, yes, but like she's like my sister now. I have mad intuition. Wait. Maybe we shouldn't do this with everyone outside. It's way more fun with all of them out there. Leslie, Leslie. In the past year, you have traveled to Africa to build wells and gone to Iceland and Machu Picchu and donated your time for fundraising and volunteering. You're just such an inspiration to all of us, and you truly are a gift, and I love you so much. We all do. Wow. So, I don't know Leslie at all, but African wells, Machu Picchu, go, Leslie. You sound like an incredible woman. Happy birthday. No, no, no, no. It's not her birthday. Leslie's cancer went into remission a year ago today. What? Why was there a cake? Who makes a cake for a cancer party? I'm so sorry. Why didn't you tell me that this was a mom survived cancer party? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Oh my God. I guess I just thought we were going to be hanging out in here, and I don't know. I wanted to see you. I am so humiliated. I cannot go back in there, and I really wanted a tiny burger. I love tiny burgers, and now I can't go back. It's not funny because someone had cancer. I'm sorry. You're very cute, though. Thank you. How the hell do I get out of your house? I can't have an anxiety disorder. If ruining my boyfriend's ex-girlfriends mom's cancer party didn't trigger a panic attack, nothing will. The fact is I'd rather relive that moment on loop than have a conversation with my own mom. She makes me feel inadequate. You've been going out a lot lately. Not really. Yes, really. You didn't even come home last Sunday. Mom, I'm 20. Are you dating someone? I hope he has a good job. He's a student. He's getting his PhD. Oh my God, a doctor. Mom, shit, Mom, I just played your game. I told you that he's getting a PhD to impress you, but I don't want to impress you and play your game. Why don't you want to talk to me? You judge. I don't judge. The judging, you always have. It's just you. I am not a judgmental person. OK. Well, no. I don't want you to think I'm judgmental. OK, I won't. Would you like to come to my yoga opening next week? I don't know. I could have something really great planned by then. I would love to have you. I've got that file for you. Oh, great. I was just running out anyway. Where are you going? Should I drive? No, no, no, I got this. No. I'm good. What should I do here? I don't know. Ask the girls. I'm sure they have something you can putter around with. I'll be back in a couple of hours. OK. Oh, shit. Oh my God. What? OK, you can do this. You can do this. You can do this. Just get in the car. Get in the car. I can do this. You can't do this. Hi. Excuse me, does anyone have a driver's license, and can you come with me for a quick drive? I only have a learner's permit, and I need a licensed driver. Please? I'm a really nice girl. It will be an adventure, and I will bring you right back. Hey, works over. Whistle's blown. Let's go home. Sorry, I forgot to give you that file. Ah, no worries. Didn't you need it for your meeting? No. No. It's nothing to worry about. My plan could have worked. Who was that woman? What were they doing? Where did they meet? Where were they going? Why the secret meeting in the garage? I forgot you're a "Murder She Wrote" fan. I mean, they were going to find a place to fuck. Are you going to tell your mom? I'll call her and tell her. He's cheating on her for sure. Oh my God. What? I probably am like my dad. Cheating. Sex. He hides smoking from my mom, too. I need a new job. I can't deal with the stress. Want to do mushrooms? Oh my God, no. We slept in a park. Do you think that were bad influences on each other? Bad? Influences, yes. Bad? What's bad? I don't know. You're so weird. What do you want to do tonight? I want to do something good. I heard you weren't returning in the fall. If you would like to talk, please call me. You are an excellent writer with so much potential, and I'd love to see you continue your education with us. Sincerely, Professor Keats. Revelation came to me in knowing that I'm able to make good choices and can somewhat enjoy them. Does that make me normal? What if it's easier to not do good things? Hello? Hey, it's Ben. Oh, hi. What are you up to? I was just going to write something. Oh, the next great novel of our time. Sorry, that was really lame. I mean, kind of lame, but I wouldn't say full on really lame. Well, I was just going to say if you're free, but... Oh, no, I am. I mean, I don't need to do this right now. Are you sure? I feel like I caught you in the middle of... No, you didn't. It's fine. What are you thinking? I was just thinking maybe I could come over. We could watch a movie or something. Jen and a friend are using the TV here. Yeah, my parents are home. Oh, right. How about I just take you out for dinner later this week? OK. So subtle, Mom. So I packed some of my things today. You haven't seen the new place yet, have you? No. It's so weird. Where would you move? When I'm on my own? Yeah. I don't know. I'd love to stay in the Valley. It's cozy. And even though I don't drive, I appreciate the available parking. I want to tell you something about me. Something I just found out from my doctor. It's weird. But... Sorry for the interruption. I've been watching you guys for a while, and I just wanted to say I think you two make the nicest looking couple. That was nice. Weird. Nobody ever stopped to tell me that with one of my neck tattoo boyfriends. Sorry. What were you just about to say? You just found something out from your doctor. Oh, right. I just found out that I am allergic to bananas. Bananas? I didn't realize that they weren't supposed to taste spicy. Huge bummer. No, you're not missing out. Thanks. So mushy. So tasteless. Sorry, I'm late. I'm happy you made it. Winona? Hey. Oh my God, I haven't seen you since 12th grade. How are you? Oh, I'm in this panic disorder group, so not good. Oh, it's not a big deal. This group is amazing. You'll see. Anyone want to open the discussion? I will. I had three panic episodes this week. How did it start? All of them were from exercise or climbing stairs. My heart beats so fast that I start freaking out I'm going to have a heart attack, and then the panic comes on, and I start to sweat and I think I'm going to die. Same. It's always the stairs. Anyone else suffer from panic episodes from physical exertion? Oh, God, should I be? Well, how does your panic manifest? I haven't had a panic attack. I have sore armpits. My armpits used to ache. Really? Yeah, all the time. Oh, I'm so jealous you haven't had a panic attack yet. Well, I don't know if I'm going to get one. Well, when you do, you'll have us. I am never going back to another group again. I am way healthier than they are. It was bonkers. Why would Doc put you in a group if you didn't belong? I don't know. Maybe to make another $1,000 an hour. So you're fine now. Everything's great. You're fixed. Yeah. I mean, even my school wants to be back, so I didn't blow that one. Oh. Are you going to go? Fuck, no. I'm like so good right now. I've never been better. Hey, Addie, you coming with us? Oh, no, I think I'm going to pass. No, come on. It's rave night. Are you sure you don't just want to hang out with me and Cameron? We're going to paint each other tonight. No. Come out with us. It's rave night. I know you love to dance and I have some good Ecstasy. No. Sleep is for the weak, Addie. You have your whole life to be domestic. You can be boring tomorrow. Give me the ex-stuff. It's worth the diarrhea. I'm going to come. What? Look at my face. Sure, where else would I look? Look at my face. I'm going to come. It was like. Oh, you're never going to be able to erase that. I am never going to forget that come face. I told you. Fucking in your childhood bed is bad luck. Whitelighters, I know. I mean, I believe it now. I wish I packed those stuffed animals up. I can't believe you're moving to an apartment on the West side. Wait, why are your parents downsizing? It's not like your house is so big. So they can use the extra cash to travel, I guess. Um, are you sure your dad isn't going to split on your mom with this new woman? I don't know if that's his new woman. I don't know anything. Sounds plausible to me. Dad has a sidepiece, wants to get out of the house, put your mom in a fancy apartment, and then he splits on her, and leaves her there alone to die. Poof. Fuck, that would be so sad. This isn't just plain terrible. This is fancy terrible. This is terrible with raisins in it. Something is off. So newsflash, I'm fine. You were wrong. And how wonderful is that? Yeah. I really have my shit together. Yeah, you do, lady. Your shit is so together that you're 20 in your pediatrician's office. See? I look at this as being really grounded. So how's Dr. Monroe working out? I told her my deepest, darkest secret and I cried. And you're fine, no armpit pain? No. I'm feeling great. A professor from college wrote me a really nice letter. I went to Mom's yoga class. I have a boyfriend. We're probably going to move in together because he's living with his ex-girlfriend, and who knows how long I'll last living in an apartment with Robert and Pamela. I mean, waiting for elevators is like so annoying. Don't I know. Any who. You should probably just move on to your next patient. So you came all the way over here to Toluca Lake just to tell me that you're fine? Yes, chief, I'm feeling fine. I really just came here to say goodbye, because I'm going to move on up, get a doctor for adults. You know, that's lovely, because most of the time I never know what happens to my patients... You are the best doctor a kid could ever ask for. And you are the most eventful and complicated patient a doctor could ever ask for. That is literally the greatest compliment of my life. Bye. Be safe. I don't have a doctor anymore. That's OK. He's a child's doctor and now I'm a woman. I'm going to be a fantastic woman. I going to learn to drive. I'm going to eat breakfast. I'm going to learn to cook. I'm going to be the best version of myself ever. I'm going to be fine. I'm an excellent friend. I'm funny. I'm smart and caring. Why did I ever doubt myself? I didn't need anybody to tell me that. OK, maybe I did, but now I'm going to be fine. My home is going to be amazing. Everybody is going to be welcome there, open house. I'm going to have a great job. I'm going to get a cat. I don't need anybody to tell me what to do. Hi, do you have any full time positions available at the moment? Yes, we're actually hiring. Perfect. I will leave you my resume. Thank you. Have a great day. You, too. Hi, could you please point me in the direction of your manager? Hi. I'm Greg, the manager. I manage. Hi. Greg. Hi, I'm Winona. I saw that you were looking for help, so I wanted to drop off a resume. Great. Cool. I love this store. Thanks. So what kind of hours are you looking for? Full time. We have a part time position available right now? Oh, then I'd have to get two jobs. Hm, two jobs is a lot of jobs. Way more than one jobs. Double jobs. One full time job is already a lot. One full time jobs is so much jobs. It would be a lot of scheduling. You'd basically need an assistant, yeah. Probably wouldn't work. Would you want to come in for an interview if we get a full time position? Hell yeah. - I mean... - Great. You're welcome. I mean, I like hell, yeah. OK, I'm just going to go look around the store. If you need any help with anything, don't hesitate to ask. This is my favorite smell in here, this bookstore. Yeah, it's a combination of the old books and a grilled cheese I just made in the back. Psst. Paycheck. Save this money. Thanks, Dad. What's with the fucking hat? Breathe in. Breathe out. Breathe in. Breathe out. You can do this. You have to, A, find out where they're going, B, see them doing something bad, and C, get some evidence. Ah, fuck. Dad. What is going on? Why are you driving? Please don't call the police on me. I'm going to call the police. What are you doing? I was following you. You... let's get you to a doctor. No, I am fine. It's a tiny head cut. Tiny head cuts bleed a lot. Everybody knows that. Robert, what's going on? Who is that woman? Why are you with her? She's a property owner. We're going to look at buildings. Oh my gosh, you scared me. Are you good? Are you sure you don't want to go to the hospital? Positive. Well, I'm going to take the car in and have the bumper popped out so your mother doesn't have to ever know anything about this. You're not going to tell her? Of course not. OK. I have a job interview at a clothing boutique. When's the interview? Tomorrow. While my dad is in a meeting nearby. I feel all shaky. You're always a little shaky and glum. Chi wah wah. Oh, shit. What? An ex just walked in. With, with, with the neck tattoos? I thought you were joking about that. Can we leave? I feel weird. Sure. Hey, you OK? I don't know. Slow down. Slow down. Too much coffee. Sorry I asked about that guy. It's none of my business. No, it's fine. You didn't do anything wrong. I told my mom about you. You did? What did you say? Let's see, I said I met a girl who was very interesting and unintentionally funny. Unintentionally funny sounds like a backhanded compliment. I wasn't meant to be. She wants to meet you. Already? Yeah, you want to do that this week? Yeah. I'll do it. I'll be done in about an hour. I'll meet you back at the car. Roger that. Roger that. So it looks like you don't have any experience in retail. Yes, that is true, but I love clothes and fashion. True passions. What would you say was the biggest challenge you've had at a job? Well, once when I worked in the coffee shop on campus, this guy gave me a $5 bill for his coffee. Then he tried to tell me that he gave me a $20. It turned into this huge argument, but I gave him the change for the $20 out of my own money to cover what the cafe lost. That guy did come back, took his pants off, nothing I could do to stop him, so I called the police. Hm. Can you give me an example of how well you work with others? Well, the coffee shop job was me alone. The video store was me alone, and now I currently am a driver for a professional male person, but really all of my interactions with coworkers and directly and solely with my boss. You're shaking. Are you OK? I had coffee before I came here, like a lot of coffee. It's definitely coffee. And you can work full time? Yes. Great. Well, I think that's it. Is there anything you want to tell me about yourself or ask me? Oh my God, my ears are ringing like a lot. I don't know why. Sorry? Do you need some water? OK, give me one second. Here. You OK? I've got to go. Oh. Where is she? She's in the back? Hi, Mom. Honey, are you OK? I am totally fine. She took a lip gloss and passed out after her interview. I broke her fall. Oh my God. Please, sweet Jesus, strike me down right now. Why did you take a lip gloss? I forgot I was holding it. It was an accident. I believe you. I don't think you stole it. I'm just concerned about you passing out like that... I am fine, Mom. You're not fine. Hi, Robert. What are you doing here? Well, I was called down in the middle of her job interview because she passed out. She says she's fine. But she's not fine, and she shouldn't drive. Sweetie, do you want a ride home? No, I'm fine. I'll see you later. OK, OK, OK. I'm worried about you. It was an accident. I don't want you to have any more accidents. First the car, and now this. I'll be more careful. Do you want to talk to somebody, a therapist? You think I need a therapist? No. I just want to be there for you, that's all. I have it. What? The panic thing. No, you don't Stephanie, I accidentally and in plain sight took a lip gloss from a store that didn't give me a job, then I passed out. Oh my God, you're the worst shoplifter. You always have been. I am telling you I wasn't shoplifting. I was freaking out. I didn't even realize that I put it on or in my pocket. I felt out of body. It was so disassociating. It was like an acid flashback, but I've never done acid. I don't even remember giving them my mom's number when I came to. Sucks. That's all you have to say? What do you want from me, Winona? I don't know, some support. I don't know. Candy? Oh, because I'm a baby? Yeah. You steal this or did you buy it this time? Come on. Hey. How did you get here? My mom dropped me off. Oh, God. What? Oh, I said hi. Hi. Should we go? Yeah. Go masturbate with a fork, Jen. Is this the street that you grew up on? Yep. It's so cute. Yeah. Is this OK? Are you OK? You seem nervous. Should we not do this? No, no, I'm fine. I just want to let you know something about my mom. She's a serial killer? OK, now, so my dad left my mom last year because he's gay. Whoa. You really buried the lead with that one. How has this not come up? I don't like talking about it really. Right. But wow. I mean, good for your dad and sad for your mom. Yeah, so you'll love my mom. She's very sweet, but because of my dad, she's gone kind of crazy. What? She gets like these panic episodes or panic attacks. She won't have one probably, but I just wanted to give you the heads up. Cool. I got it. Ben. - Hi. - Hi. Come on in. Ben told me you had blue hair. I thought he was kidding. I love corgies. This is Winnie. She's my baby girl. That's my name. She has my name. I love her even more now. Is that narcissistic? No. Ben, I forgot the tea in the other room. I'll go get it. So what do you do? I work for my dad. I'm currently looking for a new job. In what field? Um, I'm looking all over the place just for work. Can I feed Winnie a sandwich? Sure. One of these? Yeah. Just a small bite. She only has a tiny mouth. So, um, Ben, Winona was telling me that she is looking for a job, but she doesn't have a specific field. Yeah, well, she's a writer. Oh. So you're getting a writing job then? Well, no, I didn't go to journalism school, so writing jobs are hard to get. Mom is a doctor. Right. That's wonderful. Teachers and doctors are the gems of this world. That's very nice of you to say. Ben, could you pour the tea? Yeah. Ben's going to be a professor. I know, it's so great. So why don't you go to journalism school? That's fine. I just don't want to be a journalist, so that's a very easy answer. You know, it's a really hard world out there, and sometimes you just have to do things you really don't want to do. Wow, your mom was intense. I mean, lovely woman, but wow. Sorry. No, it's fine to ask the hard questions. I just wasn't expecting them. I needed more corgi time. Are you OK? Yeah, totally. Do you want to go back to yours? I could get a cab home later. Uh, no, I'll just drop you off at home. I've got some reading to do. OK. This is so good. Why don't you try some? Hm, pass. So you guys are going to be super happy to know that I packed a lot of my stuff today. Tell me about the new place. Oh my God, it's so beautiful. It has views out to Catalina and walk in closets. Walk in closet? Damn, Mom, I can't wait for our new place. Winona. Um, honey, it's not our new place. It's our new place. Oh my God, are you kicking me out? No, no, no, no. I told you that we were downsizing, and you had to find a place of your own. No, you didn't tell me that I had to find my own place. I thought you understood. That what, you don't care about me and you're kicking me out? We care about you so much. You know what I'm going to do, I am going to get a pull out couch for the office, and then you can come sleep whenever you want. A pull out couch? Mom, it is not like you have five kids to support. It is just me. I think it would be a good thing for you to have a place of your own. Fine. I'll get my own place. It just won't have a walk in closet. There was a walk in closet, but actually, it's fine. I don't want to live on the West side. I'm not a West side bitch. Fuck Catalina. Hey, I was thinking, you need all of your ex's place, I need a new house. Maybe we just move in together. Winona, I don't think this is going to work. When we were with my mom and talking about life, I couldn't help thinking, you know, you and I are just at very different stages in our lives. You don't know what you're doing or what you want. You're a high school graduate, and look, I'm getting my PhD. A PhD, and you, Winona, you are very cool and fun and funny and a really pretty girl, but you're a high school graduate who doesn't even have her driver's license. I can't honestly believe I'm dumping you, but I have to. I need to date someone who has a real life. I need to date a woman, you know? I don't know. I'm getting a PhD. Oh my God. I can just see you practicing that speech in the mirror with your mom. Look, I'm sorry. Look, let's drive home and talk some more. Ben, you really don't deserve any more words from me, but I am a deeply caring person, so I am going to give them to you see you have some context to move forward from this relationship. You said that I don't know what I want, what I am doing, but, dude, if you think that going to school every day means that you have a better clue than me, you're crazy. And by the way, let me play your game for a moment. My college wants me back. I'm a great student. I could probably get five PhDs if I actually gave a shit about a PhD, which I do not at all, Ben. And I don't know why I can't pass my driver's test. Honestly, I don't know why I didn't want to go to school. I don't know why I wanted to come home. It just didn't feel right. How I live my life may not work with your very narrow minded view of how people should be living, but I am a real woman and I would rather walk home a mile in this swampfest heat, then get in your car with you. Fuck your PhD. Mom? Guys? Guys? Mom? What is happening? Mom, I lost my mind. You have to tell me. What's wrong? Take me to the mental hospital. No, I will not. Mom, you have to. I am freaking out. What's going on here? I am having a panic attack or a nervous breakdown. You're not, sweetheart, you're just... you're just stressed. I'll go make you something to eat. Dr. Cotton diagnosed me with panic disorder. What? I didn't tell you. Why wouldn't you tell me that? I didn't believe it. It's what's making me a fuck up. You're not a fuck up. I am a fuck up. I dropped out of school because I am a fuck up. I have been going through this for eight hours. I can't take it. Watch what happens when I go in my room. What do we do? I'll look after her. Take me to the hospital. Winona, I want you to lie down, and I'm going to take care of you, OK? I'm going to go make you some soup. I don't want fucking soup. I want my mind to come back. Do you need me here? Because I can't watch this. What, Dad, you can't watch this? I crashed the car and you could watch that. What, what car crash? I thought Dad was having an affair so I followed him in his car and rear ended him and the woman that he was with. OK, slow down. No, I can't. Both of you let this happen to me. Why did you let me come home from school? Why did you make being a fuck up so easy? You made up the stupidest job in the world. You enabled me to be a zero. You are not a zero. You could be a grocery bagger and I would be so proud of you. That is the worst thing that you have ever said to me. Mom, are you seriously not going to address Dad and this affair thing? I'm not having an affair. I saw you hug her. I've known her for 30 years. Why are you so surprised that I would jump to that conclusion? You never talk to me. I don't know anything about you. I don't know anything about you, Winona. You do the same thing to me. Why would you say that at this moment? All right, you're fine. You don't need to go to the hospital. Just get some sleep. If I could sleep I would. Winona, do you want a bath? How about I draw you a bath? No. I love this house, and it's the best house ever and you sold it. You were both so stupid. I hate you. I don't hate you. I don't. Sh. Just breathe. Honey, just breathe. OK, I'm going to go make you something to eat. I can't see you like this. Well, this is me, Dad. I'm sorry. You're so much like me, Winona, it hurts. Winona? Good morning. Honey? Honey? Pamela? When did it start? Almost 24 hours. I can't look in my room without throwing up. All right, I'll be right back. I've never heard of that before. Here you go. Do me a favor. I want you just to put this under your tongue. Here you go. Get the tinfoil off. Here you go. How you doing? OK, I want you to breathe with me. In through your nose, out through your mouth. Breath in through your nose, out through your mouth. In through your nose, out through your mouth. Where's my favorite baby picture? Oh, I retired it. I put it in the closet. I'll bring it out when this is done. How do you feel? Holy shit, that pill worked. Yes, it does. How does it work that well? It's doing its job. Well, you're going to be fine now. I don't know, Dad. Well, you know what, you're right, because the pill only alleviates some of the symptoms. Now, the real solution, in my humble opinion, is therapy. He's right. Anxiety issues run in our family. I figured. You were always such a stress case. Not your mother. Me. I had a panic attack after you were born. Did you know that? I'm not his pediatrician. Look, you can get therapy. I went. I'll go back. Now that's what I want to hear. And we're here to support you in any way, no matter what. Me too. Me three. I like your jacket. Thanks, Mom. The sassy one is my favorite. I think he's a boy. He's called Ian. No shit, he is. Look at that little fucker. Ian. Dear Professor Keats, thank you for your letter. I don't really believe anyone knows how they're doing this, this life thing, but these are the facts. My facts. For better or for worse, I'm a bit of a fuck up, but we all kind of are. I don't think anyone truly knows how they'll reach their goals. No matter how well we plan, we all drown in uncertainty along the way. And the worst part, once you finally reach your goal, you have to make a new one and struggle to reach it all over again. Cool. So I guess what I'm going to do is accept all that comes with the path I am choosing. The unconventional path, because it feels the most comfortable, I'll keep believing I will get to where I belong. And then none of us really knows how we're doing this, and that's OK. What are your greatest strengths? I am intuitive. I'm good at listening. I know when someone wants to be left alone and when someone needs help. Why do you want to work here? I love books. Bookstores calm me down. I like to be calm. I like readers, so I will like all of our customers automatically. What are your current goals? I want to get my driver's license. I'm sick of cabs and buses. You currently go to school? Not at the moment, but I may go back. Great. Well, as you can see, we're pretty mellow over here, not that formal. But I'd like to hire you full time. You're great. No way. Hell, yeah. Can you start Monday? Yes. Also, I feel like there is a thing here between us, and I just want to say that there can be no thing. No thing. I mean, did I just lose this job for saying that? Oh my God. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be inappropriate. Sometimes I just blurt things out. It's classic Sagittarius. No, its fine. It's fine. I totally get it. I'm a Capricorn. Oh, shit. Are you OK? You're alone. You're never alone.
