In 1991, a couple out hiking discovered a human mummy here which a glacier had released after 5,300 years-- Oetzi, the Iceman, who never made it back into the valley. [wind gusting] There are many paths that traverse the Alps. The most spectacular is unmarked and leads precipitously across the summits and ridges. In no other landscape is the helicopter more in its element. Anyone who acquires their pilot's license here is a real pro. [helicopter whirring] [bright music] ♪ But there are also alternative routes for those who prefer keeping their feet on the ground. Some of these routes were already known to the Romans, like the one at Grossglockner, Austria's highest mountain.

Salt, spices, and cloth were conveyed north along these routes. ♪ ♪ [wind gusting] But the Alps are also crisscrossed with paths like these. Soldiers once marched along here. Until today, many routes through the mountains have left their marks like scars. [solemn music] ♪ [cannons boom distantly] This was where the front line crossed the mountains during the First World War. It was the Verdun of the Alps. 900,000 Italians fought against 800,000 Austrians, and both sides fought to exhaustion. ♪ But often the worst enemy wasn't the opponent, but the mountain itself: rockfall, fog, and snow slabs, or simply the bitter cold. Temperatures often dropped to -40 degrees Celsius for weeks on end. ♪ Every grenade, every piece of firewood, every water bottle had to be carried up here on mules or by the soldiers themselves, and some of their debris still litters the landscape today. ♪ At Col di Lana in the Dolomites, half the mountain was blasted away, all for the sake of advancing a few hundred meters. The longer the war lasted, the more desperate and insidious the operations became. ♪ In the First World War, the Alpine front extended from Bormio in Lombardy to the Adriatic Sea. At least 150,000 men never made it back home. ♪ [wind gusting, birds chirping] [engine approaching] But war often brought progress too. The railway, for example. [train horn blares] When Austria was still a great power in Europe, the first mountain railway was constructed at Semmering Pass. [uplifting music] 20,000 workers built tunnels and viaducts by hand and without dynamite. It was a milestone of the Austria-Hungarian Empire, and the first passenger to use the route was, of course, the Emperor Franz Josef himself. ♪ Along the tracks, villages and towns flourished. ♪ The most beautiful train journey through the Alps, though, is from St. Moritz in Switzerland to Tirano in Italy, the route of the Bernina and the Glacier Express trains. It is the highest railway line in Europe, reaching an altitude of more than 2,200 meters. [engine revving] At the beginning of the 20th century, the first cars made it up into the Alps. Here, engineers artistically sculpted snakes of asphalt into the landscape, like at Stelvio Pass in Italy. Even more popular is the scenic route leading up to Austria's highest mountain-- and has been since Celtic times. 3,000 years of cultural history lie beneath the tarmac of the Alpine road of Grossglockner Mountain. There are only a dozen panoramic roads through the Alps. They all attract vintage car enthusiasts from all over Europe. When the construction of the mountain pass began in 1930, it was the subject of much mockery. Some even predicted its failure. They couldn't have been more wrong. Austria and Switzerland built motorways early on to deal with traffic between northern and southern Europe. The foreigners passing through here are not particularly welcome. They tend to leave exhaust fumes and noise in their wake rather than money. No wonder medieval practices were reintroduced here: road tolls. On the southern edge of the Alps, a view from above shows how a beautiful valley can be ruined by expansion, like here in the Italian town of Bolzano. [indistinct chatter] When mountains come with their very own lake or beach, estate agents exult. This is a perfect location for the most expensive housing in the Alpine region: Lake Lugano. Cynics claim this is the only place for la dolce vita in all of Switzerland. 50 years ago, only the elite spent their holidays in Ticino-- among them, Swiss writer Max Frisch. Today, Majorca and Ibiza have beaten southern Switzerland in the holiday stakes. Now mainly pensioners come here to enjoy the mild climate. Nearby Lake Maggiore is the lowest place in Switzerland at just under 200 meters above sea level, and it still lies nestled in the mountains. One of the area's most beautiful spots is Ascona. From 1910 on, painters and nudists gathered here. Those who seek an alternative lifestyle in Switzerland today need more than just love, air, and sunshine. Above all, they need plenty of cash. [peaceful music] ♪ Testing one's limits is another way of leaving everything behind in the mountains. Outdoor enthusiasts are part of the Alps, like chalets and cowbells. [wind gusting] [atmospheric music] ♪ Humans aren't the only ones to leave their mark on the mountains. Nature isn't too keen on obstacles of stone either. The wind and the weather eat away at the mountains imperceptibly. Even though they appear so massive, they are, in fact, highly vulnerable. The Alps are under attack from all sides. [wind gusting] ♪ The damage done by water and the wind can be seen in the soft limestone of Ferlach Mountain on the Austrian border to Slovenia. ♪ The Langkofel in the Dolomites has another problem: It has lost its core. Like a hollow tooth, only the hard outer shell remains. But the good news is, the mountains grow back. The tectonic plates continue to exert their force, making the Alps grow by one millimeter each year, precisely the amount they lose to the wind and the weather. [solemn music] ♪ The vulnerability of the Alps is dangerous for humans too. Living in close proximity to the mountains can come at a high price for the present inhabitants or their descendants many generations later. ♪ In August 2011, an avalanche of stones hurtled down into the valley, close to the city of Merano in northern Italy. By a miracle, it narrowly missed the Greiter farm. It finally came to a standstill, after 1,500 meters, in an apple orchard. ♪ ♪ At the Erzberg in Styria, humans have beaten nature to it by eroding the mountain themselves. [whimsical music] ♪ The work once done by miners with hammer and chisel has been taken over by dynamite. ♪ With each blast, the most important ore mine in Austria delivers 25 tons of the sought-after metal, enough to build 20 cars. ♪ The visitors almost look like creatures from another world as they're driven through the pit in their monster trucks. ♪ For over 1,300 years, Erzberg Mountain, between Salzburg and Vienna, has provided the raw material for kitchen pots and cars, and the mountain still hasn't been completely mined. It will take another 50 years to exhaust the supplies. The material is carted off in one of the largest lorries in the world, 1,000 HP strong and able to haul 100 tons of stones. With the petrol they use, a normal car could drive from the Alps to China and back. In the Middle Ages, the rulers of Styria determined that the ore from the northern slopes of the Erzberg would be traded in northern Europe, while that from the southern part would be transported via Venice to Egypt. [wind gusting] Nature's own means of transport is usually far slower and more muted. Ground-up pebbles and sand flow down the Alps in streams and rivers into the nearest sea. A stone that rolls down here at Lake Toma in Switzerland may be setting off on a long journey... Through a small stream all the way to the Atlantic Ocean. [peaceful music] ♪ The Rhine must cover a distance of more than 1,200 kilometers from its source in Switzerland to its estuary in Holland, always carrying its baggage from the Alps. ♪ The course of the river leads through valleys and villages, some of which are flooded when the snow melts, like Spluegen, a quaint little village with its characteristic Walser houses. ♪ In the Ruinaulta, the Rhine canyon, the stream cut a gorge for itself when mighty rockfall blocked its path. [wind gusting] Even as a stream, the Rhine shows its potential to become a mighty river and flows through one of the most beautiful gorges in Switzerland. Stream upon stream joins the Rhine, making it swell into a wide and mighty river. [birds chirping] Shortly before reaching Lake Constance, the Rhine is tamed. There used to be a delta here, but man had other plans and, quite literally, set things straight. The untamed Alpine river now flows in a concrete bed and is guided into Lake Constance in an orderly fashion, more like a canal than a river. The dams on the river banks are intended as flood protection. Two bodies of water merge-- mountain and lake water-- and it almost seems as if the Rhine were offended and disappears. But that's simply the result of the temperature difference between the icy mountain water and the lake water heated by the sun. The rubble that has been transported here through Switzerland free of charge miraculously becomes Austrian state property. Here it can be dredged for a fee. Austria is cashing in on the Alpine rubble. [machinery beeping] [disquieting music] ♪ 700 kilometers further west, in the foothills of the French Alps, the powerful water from the mountains has plowed a deep gorge 25 kilometers in length. ♪ For some people, merely enjoying the breathtaking views isn't thrilling enough. ♪ Someone else, who also wanted to live life on the edge, has created his personal dream world here. A man called Ludwig II was fascinated by the primordial force of the mountains. He was known as the fairy-tale king of Bavaria and had one dream palace after another built in the mountains. He decreed them all to be demolished after his death. At Linderhof Castle, his troubled soul found peace and distraction. Ludwig came here frequently, even though he had far more splendid palaces elsewhere. King Ludwig was detained as mentally ill in his most famous castle, Neuschwanstein. But without him, the German state of Bavaria would sorely lack many spectacular buildings and entrance fees. [gentle music] ♪ Ludwig's megalomania created a myth for all eternity. Herrenchiemsee, his version of Versailles, was his last creation. He committed suicide before its completion-- or maybe was murdered. The exact circumstances of his death are still a matter of dispute. ♪ [laughter] [cheerful polka music] ♪ Like many other inhabitants of the Alps, the Bavarian tribe is said to be highly self-assured. A good way to experience the Bavarian way of life is to go timber rafting or simply have a beer in view of the Alps. ♪ [church bells ringing] Many of the traditions in the Alpine region are similar from Slovenia to the Mediterranean Alps, like the sound of church bells. [church bell ringing] However, Christianity only gradually reached the far corners of the Alps. Historians have hardly found any traces of churches and chapels from before the Middle Ages, a time when many monasteries were built. [people chanting] [tranquil music] ♪ People learned to write in the monasteries. They were the Alpine centers of knowledge on natural medicines and culture. The concentration of monasteries in the mountains is particularly high. They were frequently founded by hermits. Earls and dukes would donate their land, hoping that their gift would pay off in the afterlife. Today, hosts of people go on pilgrimages to these special places-- not heavenly hosts, however. ♪ Every weekend, thousands of people take to the hills. There are plenty of fascinating places to go, though eventually there may not be enough parking spaces to go around. Since 1909, the elegant electric boats have glided across Koenigsee-- King's Lake-- with the sheer mountain wall of the Watzmann. ♪ For over 900 years, the patron saint of dairy and Alpine farmers has been worshipped here at St. Bartholomew. This beer garden is one of the most beautiful in Bavaria, where church and beer have always formed a holy allegiance.
