[gunshots] [music playing] [electric crackling] All our tests show that he's an extremely bright child, bordering on genius. However, as you well know, he's both mentally and emotionally unstable. I strongly feel that any outsideemotional stimulus could be what pushes him over the edge. You have to be gentle, Mrs. Dornwinkle. I urge you to give him trust andunderstanding during this very difficult period. You have a very confused little boy there. However, he's a very, very sweet child. Give him the trust and understanding he so desperately needs. I will, Doctor. And thank you for everything. [music playing] [SINGING] Oh, my darling. Please come home. Time stands still when you're alone. I want you, darling. How much, you'll never know. When I hold you near me, whisper out my name. [inaudible] for my darling,can you stay and wait? How long, how long, must I wait for you? How long, how long, must I wait? How long, how long, must I wait for you? Remember when you leftletters stained with tears? I'll wait for you forever. I'll wait a million years. Did you hear me say I loveyou, need you, want you here? Just hold you in my arms,won't leave you, never fear. Every night a romance. Every day, wake with a kiss. Come back to me, my darling. You're the one I miss. How long, how long, must I wait for you? How long, how long, must I wait? How long, how long, must I wait for you? [whistles] [SINGING] When I hold you nearme, whisper out your name-- [door opens] What are you doing? Nothing, Mother. Oh, nothing, huh? What are you looking at? I'm just looking through my telescope. Oh, you're just lookingthrough your telescope, huh? Oh, you filthy stinking pervert! Ow, Mom. Please don't. You should be in here studying, not acting like somesexually depraved vagrant off the street. How do you expect tobecome a scientist if this is how you spend your time? Women are bad, Kevin. Women are evil. Now, I don't want you looking at them. I don't want you talking to them. And I don't want you thinking about them. You should be studying. But Mom-- Don't "but Mom" me, you little nothing! You're grounded for a year. You're not leaving this room. And I'm boarding up your windows. Mom, please. MRS. DORNWINKLE: KevinDornwinkle, you are a failure. Do you understand me? Now, I don't want to hearyou talking back to me again. Am I understood? You make me sick. [echoing laugh] Fellow scientists, welcometo the International Physics Symposium. As you well know, we have gathered here at the request of Dr. KevinDornwinkle, who claims his latest scientific finding will be the greatest singlediscovery of the century. Dr. Dornwinkle, I think Ispeak on behalf of everyone in this room when I admit my skepticism over your so-called breakthrough. But nonetheless, you haveour undivided attention. Thank you, doctors. As you know, my area of expertise is the area of molecular reorganization. Now, as a result of my years of experimentation with the realignment of atomic particles, I have not only been ableto recreate a substance within a substance, I have beenable to decreate any substance via molecular reorganization. We've all read your theoriesof molecular reorganization in the journals, Dr. Dornwinkle. But what I can't understandis, what new material are you getting at? My molecular reorganization"theories," as you call them, are about to be proven asreality before your very eyes. To put it in its simplest terms, I have devised a way for a man or a woman to become completely invisible. [audience mutters] That's ridiculous. I don't believe that. I came all the way fromBelgium for such nonsense? I am so confident about my work that instead of injectingmy serum into a pig, I will demonstrate my serum on myself. Feast your eyes on amiracle of modern medicine. [intense music] [heart beating] Oh. [heartbeat quickens] I can still see you, Dr. Dornwinkle. [laughs] [audience joins laughter] Dornwinkle, you are a disgraceto the scientific community. Dornwinkle, you're thestupidest man I've ever seen. You want to see invisible? Watch us all leave. The only thing invisibleabout you, Dr. Dornwinkle, is your brain! [laughter continues] No! No! No! [intense music] [scientists yelling] Hey! Somebody help me! [inaudible] Stop it! No! What are you doing? No! No! Aah! No! [grunting] Aah! Aah! [laughs maniacally] Last month, a quadruple murder sent shockwaves through the scientific communitywhen Dr. Kevin Dornwinkle went berserk, killing in coldblood four of the world's top scientific minds. Now, in a turn of events almostas shocking as the murders themselves, Dr. Dornwinklewill escape the death penalty due to a psychiatrist's testimony that he is mentallyincapable of standing trial. Dr. Dornwinkle will be committed to the State Institution for the Criminally Insane, where he will undergo extensive therapy. And on a lighter note, navy jackets are back. [music playing] [alarm sounding] [dogs barking] Go! Go! Fetch! Fetch! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! GIRL: Well, didn't you all hear the news? I mean, it was on TV and the-- my mom told me, woke me up. How did he die? Maybe he ate himself to death, huh? Yeah. Sounds more likesomething you'd do, Gordon. Oh, ha-ha. Very funny, Joan. Man, I can't believe Mr. Frankis is dead. What a heavy trip, man. Heavy trip. Maybe he had a heart attack. He had high blood pressure, you know? How would you know thathe had high blood pressure? How could you not know? I mean, his face was always as red as a beet. True. Hey, maybe since Old ManFrankis kicked the bucket, we won't have to take physics this summer. All right, dude! How can you guys be so heartless? Mr. Frankis just died. And all you care about is giving out of class. I'm not heartless. Watch. Aw. Oh, take it home. Come on. Get a room, huh? All right, class. Settle down. Take your seats. As your principal, it is my sad task died last week. Excuse me, Miss Cello. How'd he die? Thank you for your concern, Bubba. Mr. Frankis unfortunatelychoked to death on a sandwich. What kind of sandwich was that? A barbecue beef sandwich. However, I want to assure you all that we will continue your summer school session as scheduled. Fortunately, we found a newteacher to replace Mr. Frankis. GIRL: Oh, boy. MRS. CELLO: Now, I would likeyou to meet your new physics teacher, Dr. Kevin Smith. [class laughing] Good morning, everybody. Well, Dr. Smith, I'm going to leave you to mold these young mindsinto the future physicists of tomorrow. Thank you, Miss Cello. Hello, class. To begin, I hope that thisclass is enjoyable for everyone. So let's get started. Physics, as you know, isthe poetry of the sciences. Now, everything is in harmonyand has reason as its basis. Now, what are the fourbasic principles of physics? Does anyone know? [playful music] What's your name? Vicky. Vicky, do you know whatthe four basic principles of physics are? Dairy, meats, fruitsand vegetables, and grain. No, those are the four food groups. [laughter] Commit this to memory, becauseit is the essence of physics. And physics is the essence of life. Is this guy for real? KEVIN: The four basic principles of physics are matter, energy, motion, and force. [muffled laughter] CHEERLEADERS: 2, 4, 6, 8, who do we appreciate? Lions, lions, yeah, lions. Woo! All right! You're OK. Ready. CHEERLEADERS: OK. We're going to win, win, win, win, win. We're going to fight, fight, [inaudible].. We're going to kick that ball and kick it right. You ain't going to touchdown. Out of sight. Go, team! Woo! Woo! [eerie music] Man, I sure wish I had a chick. Getting girls is easy, Bubba. You just got to know how to talk to them. I know what to say to them. I say, hey, baby. You want to take a psychedelicjourney through time with me? Wrong. You don't-- you don'tsay that to a '90s chick. You say, hey, baby, you look like a smart, intelligent, artistic person. Now, let me shake my facebetween your hooters and blah. [laughter] Hey, Bubba, I think thatBetty kind of likes you. BUBBA: No kidding? CHET: Oh, yeah. If I were you, I'd keep my eye on her. Yo, Bunny! Bleachers! BUNNY: OK, girls, take five. I'll be back in a few minutes. You know, every time Isee you bouncing up and down in that outfit, I go crazy. Chet, I love you more than anything. Chet, not here. I can't help it if I findyou completely irresistible. You do? You know I do. You're the only girl for me, Bunny. I am? You know you are. Let's do it right here. Come on. No one will see us. I promise. Are you crazy? You're going to get us expelled. Look, I'll meet you after school. Oh, but that's hours away. Well, think about something else. I mean, it's mind over body. OK. OK. You know, it's hard for me, too. Well, personally, I think we should do it in class in front of everybody. But that's the differencebetween me and you. You are so terrible. Hey, speaking of terrible,what about that teacher, Dr. Smith? God, he's such a dork. I mean, anybody thatpassionate about something as stupid as physics-- he's got to be a complete idiot. Yeah, I know. What a moron. This guy's worse than Frankis ever was. Hey, I got an idea. What? This is good. Let's drive him nuts. What you mean by nuts? Nothing serious, just some harmless fun, some innocent pranks. We'll all just tease him a little. I'll get the guys. You get the girls. OK. Well, what do we do first? I'll think of something. I'm starting to like thisphysics better already. I love you. I love you, too. Oh, god. Oh, I got to hit the showers. - Can I watch? - Chet! What? Let's hit the showers, girls. Hey! Watch where you're going! [groans] BUNNY: What's he trying to say? [groans] Henry's a mute. He can't say anything, can you, Henry? BUNNY: Gives me the creeps. He's always giving us girls these weird looks. [groans] Is that true, Henry? [groans] I don't care if it is or isn't. Just don't come aroundbothering them anymore, OK? Thanks, Chet. Let's get out of here. [water running] [music playing on radio] [cheerleaders laughing] [suspenseful music] What are you doing? Nothing! Nothing? I dropped some change out of my pocket. I was looking for it. Oh, I've dropped change many times. It's funny how those blastedcoins roll everywhere. Uh, yes. Uh, I have some lesson plans to prepare. Excuse me. Oh, Dr. Smith, April's parents called me. And they're very concernedabout her grades. They were wondering if you wouldgive her some private tutoring in physics. I have her address and phone number right here. I overheard the studentstalking about me today. I don't think they like me. I'm trying so hard. I've put the past behind me. I have to be thankful for the opportunities that teaching is giving me. I can continue my experiments. If only I could isolate the isotope responsible for my previous failures. But I'm getting closer. OK, class. Tomorrow, we'll continue ourdiscussion on black holes. HS3. HS3. HS3! Of course! I've got it now. I have found the missing component to my serum. HS3, of course! Tonight is a night that will go down in history, a night that will be long remembered. 2:37 AM, Monday, June 21. Shh. I am injecting the serum into the bunny rabbit. The injection is completed. Damn! I have completely restructured my formula for the decreation of the atom. The inclusion of HS3 to the negative was a miscalculation on my part earlier. And I had substituted beryllioxin its pure grain form. This small yet significantchange in my formula should camouflage the atom within itself, thus creating a union of matter and space. Yes. This will be successful. The time-- 11:36 PM, Monday, June 28. I am injecting the bunny rabbit with the serum. Injection completed. I am now waiting for the serum to take effect. Ah! This is fantastic! At 11:37 and 15 secondsexactly, the bunny rabbit is completely invisible. Oh my god, my god, my god! I've done it! This is an historic day for science. God, I can't believe that I've done it. But I've done it. I have done it. I've done it. I've done it! I have complete-- and I've done it my way! I've done it. It's done! It's completely, completely invisible. God, I havesinglehandedly-- me, me, me! I have singlehandedly changedthe course of science forever. God, and they dare to laugh at me-- me, the greatest scientificmind of all time! [laughs maniacally] Me! And they laughed at me, at me, at me! I have to try it on a human being to see if works on a human being. I must inject myself with the serum. I must do it immediately. Injection completed. I will be the first human being to ever be completely invisible. [heart beating] Oh god, I can feel my heatracing through my veins. My heart and respiration are beating faster. I can feel it in my brain. Oh god, I feel dizzy. Oh god, I can feel it working! [electric crackling] It worked! [laughs] It worked! I'm invisible! Invisible! [laughs] The rabbit. It's been exactly 10 minutessince I injected him. How very interesting. All the day's activities have been so trying. I'm so tired. I must sleep, sleep, sleep. [ECHOING] What's the matter, Dr. Dornwinkle? Cat got your tongue? Come in. I love Dr. Dornwinkle. Mm. [makes kissing noise] Come on in, Dr. Dornwinkle. [shrill laughter] The serum has a severe sideeffect on my dream state, one that I'm sure is harmless. However-- however, I do feel a tremendous urge to reinject myself with theserum, an urge that can only be satiated by another injection. MRS. CELLO [IN THOUGHTS]:April's parents called me. And they're very concernedabout her grades. They were wondering if you wouldgive her some private tutoring in physics. I have her address andphone number right here-- address to me right here. I have her address and phone number right here. [heart beating] Did I startle you, Dr. Smith? Good morning, Vicky. I, uh-- I wasn't expectinganyone until the bell. Well, yes. That's why I'm here. I needed a minute alone with you. How, wonderful. Uh, to go over some formulas, perhaps? Well, actually, I wantedto talk about my grades. You see, I need an A in physics this summer in order to graduate. And I'd be willing to do anything for an A. Well, Vicky, I-- um, to get an A, I mean, allyou have to do is study hard and do your homework. Physics-- Forget the physics. Let's talk physical. Vicky, this is most unorthodox. Well, Dr. Smith, I'm not just doing this because I want an A. I'mdoing this because I want to. This is really unprofessional, Vicky. [bell rings] Ooh! Good morning, class. Morning. Well, I hope everyone's well rested. STUDENT: Hey, what's up, Doc? I know I had a wonderfulevening last night. And today promises to be a great day. [burps] [laughter] That was disgusting, Gordon. Hey, thanks, Doc. And on that note, I thinkwe will have a pop quiz. How does everyone feel about that? [groaning] - What? Aw, come on. You didn't tell us there wasgoing to be a test, a quiz. Well, that's one of theprivileges of being a teacher. I can do what I want when I want. OK, you're going to needthe whole period for this. You can use the formulas thatare up on the blackboard, and absolutely no cheating. Begin. [playful music] [books crash] [laughter] Yeah! Did you see him jump? STUDENT: Oh, yeah. It scared the shit out of him. [laughter] Enough! That was absolutely unnecessary. Turn in those tests immediately. Dude, we hardly got to start. Don't call me dude! Everybody fails. That's an automatic F for everybody! Jesus Christ. MRS. CELLO [ON INTERCOM]:Attention, students. Chet Wilson, please come to the office. Chet Wilson, to the office, please. Oh, great. What did I do this time? KEVIN: The rest of you,open your texts to page 81. [knocking on door] MRS. CELLO: Come in. You wanted to see me, Miss Cello? Yes, Chet. Have a seat. I have your English achievementtests in front of me. And they don't look so good. Yeah, well, sometimes Ifreeze when I'm taking a test. Well, I'd be hard put torecommend you to a good college with these grades. What about my football scholarship? It's null and void unless I approve it. But I got to go to college. Well, maybe we can workout some kind of arrangement. Great, I'm for a deal. What do you have in mind? It's lonely at the top, Chet. Maybe I could give you some extra credit for extracurricular activities. You mean, I wouldn'thave to read any more books or take another test? No. All you have to do ismake me feel like a woman. No problem. Miss Cello. CHEERLEADERS: Ready. OK. Give me a K. K! Give me an I. I! Give me an L. L! Give me another L. L! What's that spell? Kill! Louder! Kill! Woo! Woo! Woo! OK, girls. Let's hit the showers. [inaudible] Can you believe that loser, Dr. Smith, flunking us all on that test? What a jerk. Oh, yeah. But anybody that wears his pants as high as he does, he's got to be a little bit off. - Yeah. - A little off? I think he's a lot off. Come on, you guys. I think you're being a little too hard. Oh, come on, April! I bet you he's never evenbeen with a woman before. I mean, what kind of woman wouldhang out with a dud like that? You guys aren't going to believe what I did. Uh-oh. Here it comes. What'd you do? I made sicko, scumbag Dr.Smith think that I want him. I went to the class before physics. And I gave him the old "I'lldo anything for an A" routine. Ah! Oh, gross! You weren't serious, were you? Of course not. I would never really do it with him. I mean, I'll just go to physics every day, early, before the bell,get him really worked up. And he'll give me an A justthinking I'm going to do it. Don't you agree? That's great. I wish I would have thought of that. Only works for you, Vicky. All of us cannot be so brilliant. Yeah, well, we'll work on it. I can't believe you did that. [SINGING] A shower a day [inaudible].. KEVIN: I used the serum again this afternoon. It has the most unusual side effect. I was inexplicably drawnto the girls' locker room. I watched them undress and shower. I know it was wrong, but Ijust couldn't help myself. It seems that the serum taps into my most deep-rooted sexual fantasies. I can't seem to get enough. I just seem to want more. Ow! Who pinched me? Nobody pinched you, Betty. Just calm down. Well, it felt like somebody pinched me. Betty, you need a boyfriend. Come on, Vicky. I wrenched my shoulder. I'm going to stay here and let the hot water run on it a little longer. I'll meet you guys later. You disgusting degenerate. What did I tell you before, huh? [groans] Look, you stupid mutant! I don't want to see you overhere by this hole again! And if I ever see you over here,I'm going to knock the hell out of you, you understand? [groans] Get out of here. [playful music] [music intensifies] DOCTOR: You have a very confusedlittle boy there, one that will eventually grow up tokill a lot of women, who will be invisible when he kills them, who no one will be able to see-- a paranoid schizophrenic-- No! DOCTOR: --with emotional treatments, a sexual deviate of the highestorder, a man who hates women, someone who women willhate and hates them back, someone who will enjoy-- - No! DOCTOR: --cutting them and eviscerating them-- No! Get away! Get away!DOCTOR: --someone who has-- KEVIN: Get away! DOCTOR: --the ability and the knowledge-- No! DOCTOR: --of how to killwomen in the most disgusting, perverted, vile way ever known to man. No, no! You're a failure, Kevin. No! No! I'm disappointed in you. I hate you. Get away! No! [inaudible] [ECHOING] Murderer. Out of here, warthog! Get out of here, jackass. Get out of here, warthog. - Go on. - Get out of here. Get out of here. God, that gives me the creeps, man. Yeah, I know. Check that out. Who put Miss Cello's number up there? I don't know. Boy, I hope that Smith doesn'tpop another quiz on us today. Hey, Smith will getwhat's coming to him when we keep up the torture treatment. I know. I thought he was going to havea stroke when we all dropped our books at the same time. Well, wait till he sees whatwe've got in store for him today. Yeah, we'll teach him not to give us an automatic F on our quizzes. Hey, what do you think yourgrade would've been if he didn't automatically flunk us? An F. It's a different kind of F. At least I would have earned it, you know? That's true. Let's get out of here. Let's do it. BUNNY: Vicky, how am I goingto get Chet to marry me? Bunny, you have to give in tothe poor guy once in a while. I know, but he's such an exhibitionist. I mean, he wants to do itin the strangest places. Well, Gordon and I did itin the girls' locker room. And we did it in Henry's broom closet. You are so disgusting. If you want Chet to marryyou, Bunny, that's what you're going to have to do. Do you really think so? I know so. All right. Let's get out of here. All right. KEVIN: But Aristotle believedthat the heavier an object, the faster it'll fall to the ground. Now, it took Galileo'sexperiments with an inclined plane to disprove this. However-- Sorry to disturb you, Dr. Smith. Oh, that's quite all right. MRS. CELLO: May I speak to you in my office? KEVIN: Well, certainly. OK, now, I expect all of youto behave while I'm gone. Now, during the interim, youcan fill out the questions at the back of chapter eight. [music playing] What can I do for you, Miss Cello? Dr. Smith, you don't have a wife, do you? No, I don't. A girlfriend, perhaps? Female companion? No, no. What is it you're getting at? I'll be very blunt with you. I find you extremely attractive. We're both adults. I have needs. You have needs. It's lonely at the top. Do you understand me? I think I understand. Good. Miss Cello, please. What's wrong? I just don't think this is right. I'm sorry. You're not going anywhere. I found this in your desk. I was hoping it wouldn'tcome to this, but it has. I want you out of thisschool and out of this town. I'm calling the police assoon as you leave this office. Operator, connect me with the police department. You're a fool, Smith. Ever since I was in grade school, I wanted to do this to a principal. [laughter] [screams] [inaudible] He who laughs last laughs best. REPORTER: And now the news. The search still continues for Dr. Kevin Dornwinkle, internationallyrespected scientist and escaped killer. Dornwinkle, who escaped-- God, I hate the news, man. Me too. Who cares about the news? It's for squares. Now you're starting to talk my language, babe. Oh, Bubba. Oh, Betty. I've wanted to do this for so long. Me too. Oh, I want you. I've wanted to do this-- Oh, me too. --for so long. Oh! Ah! [laughter] I don't know! Something's got my hand! I can't! I can't! Ah! Stop! Betty, get it off me! Betty! What's happening? Betty! KEVIN: Lunch time! [laughs] [grunts] KEVIN: Don't talk with your mouth full. [laughs] [screams] KEVIN: I told you, don't call me dude. Oh my god, Bubba. Oh, what's going on? [screams] KEVIN: [laughs] Come here, you little brat. Oh, you're taking a trip? See you next fall. [laughs] Torpedoes away! I think I'd like to hose you down. [laughs] Nobody likes a goody-goody. [laughs] Hm. I think I need a breast job. No, don't you know? I mean, small breasts are in. I read it in "Vogue." What do you think about my butt? Do you think it's too big? April, you're a stick. Oh, baloney. Oh, do I tell you? Betty told me thatGordon's cousin is a fag. Can you believe it? No way! Ah, dude! [groans] Can't a girl get a little privacy in here? Let's just leave him alone. Let's get a life. Wow, it's so quiet in here. Yeah. Kind of eerie, huh? No kidding. God damn it. Who would lock the doorsin the middle of the day? What if there's a fire? - I don't know. Let's go to the side door. What's that in the middle of the hall? Oh my god, April, look. It's-- it's Betty! She's dead! She's dead! [screaming] Oh, Dr. Smith, thank god you're here. What's the matter, girls? You look like you've seen a ghost. It's worse. It's much worse. It's-- Now, just calm down and tell me what happened. Well, all the doors are locked. And Betty, she's dead in the hall. Dead? Now, what do you mean, dead?- She's dead. She's dead. She's got a fire hose wrapped around her neck. A fire hose-- that's very strange. Strange? God, you got to get us out of here. You have to help us. The office-- we'll go to theoffice and call the police. No! Now, let's be levelheaded about this. I don't want you running around in the hallways if there's a murderer loose! I'll go to the officeand call the authorities. You just stay calm and stay here. OK. OK, please hurry. Thank you. Hurry. OK. Now, just stay calm. I'll be right back. Please hurry. Please hurry. I still think we shouldn't wait here like a couple of sitting ducks. I think we should leave now! No, no. Let's just do as Dr. Smith said. We can't lose our heads. There's a killer out there in the hallway. We'll just calm down and waitfor Dr. Smith to come back. He'll know what to do. Oh, god. Betty was so young. I can't believe it. I know. So are we. So let's not do anything crazy. You're right. KEVIN: Help is on the way, girls. Oh, thank god, Dr.-- did you hear Dr. Smith's voice? I thought so. God, this gives me the creeps. Maybe we should get out of here. We got to go. Oh my god, how could thisdoor have gotten locked? I don't know, April. Something's going on. Shoot. Ah! Ah! Oh, sweet Jesus. What's happening? Oh my god! Where is-- who did that? Ah! [both scream] KEVIN: [laughs] Who's doing that? God! Ah! What the-- help! KEVIN: Move it or lose it. April, help me! Help me! Help! [screams] KEVIN: [laughs] APRIL: [inaudible] Stop! KEVIN: Come here. I've got something to show you. April, help me! APRIL: Ah! Stop! KEVIN: Come on. Don't be afraid. [loud scratching] JOAN: Let me go! Let me go! No! KEVIN: Come on. Come on. JOAN: No! KEVIN: Here you go. Get up, [inaudible],, and get [inaudible]---- Joan! [screams] [screams] KEVIN: [laughs] APRIL: Stop! Stop! KEVIN: Say aah! Say aah! [laughs] Help! Joan. KEVIN: [SINGING] I love to goswimming with bow-legged women. Woo-hoo! Over here. Boo! Over here! Ah! KEVIN: Yoo-hoo! Ah! KEVIN: [laughs] Over here. [choking] KEVIN: [laughs] You played great today. I couldn't believe it. - Well, thank you. You did too. - I was impressed. Hey, where is everybody, anyway? I don't know. But I'm going to go take a quick shower. And I'll meet you back in 10 minutes. Mwah. Can I come watch? Oh, gosh. [water running] [music playing] [SINGING] The rain, the rain,the rain puts the fear of God in my brain. The light rips through the sky at night-- [whistles] [SINGING] --from each side. And the sound, the sound, thesound, the sound [inaudible] puts the fear of God in my heart and my mind. [whistles] [SINGING] And the [inaudible]with infinite grace. Who's there? Is anyone here? Gordy, is that you? [crackling] [screams] [hums] Hey, Vicky! Vicky! Vicky. Vicky? Vicky, where are you? God, I'm always looking for you. Vicky? Vicky? Oh my god! [screams] Jesus Christ! [screams] [grunts] KEVIN: [laughs] GORDON: Help! Oh, Jesus Christ! KEVIN: [laughs] What the hell? KEVIN: Oops, not that way. Not that-- [grunts] [music playing] KEVIN: Nuh-uh. Not that way either. Where are you going? Where are you going? You missed. Ah! Missed again. Damn! Damn! Oh. KEVIN: Wrong turn. Missed, missed, missed, missed! Missed! Let go! KEVIN: Come here. I got you. Ouch! KEVIN: Ooh, watch your head. Oof, did you take a fall? Missed? Where are you? KEVIN: Whoa! Not so fast. What the fuck? [grunts] KEVIN: A swing and a miss,and a swing and a miss. Got you! Got you! KEVIN: Watch your head. Come on. Come on, come on. [grunts] Come on, you son of a bitch! [inaudible] I give up. I give up. KEVIN: No, nobody gives up. OK, I give up. OK-- [screams] KEVIN: Basic law of physics. What goes up must come down. [laughs] Come on. The coast is clear. This is Mrs. Cello's office. What if she walks in? She won't. Chet, this is so dangerous. Remember, without risk, there can be no love. [music playing] [SINGING] You seem like someone I know. You are familiar to me. You've got a song on your heart. The melody of the nightingale is you. I've known you somewhere before. Now I want to know you some more. You've got a song on your heart. The melody of the nightingale is you. Each day is a wonder. Each night is a right time. Each dream passing through my mind feels like someone who loves me. Ah, ah-ah-ah, ah, ah, ah-ah-ah. Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. You know, we really shouldn'tbe doing this in school. I mean, it's so risky. Yeah, but that's what makes it more fun. You're such a daredevil, Chet. Chet? Yeah? When are you going to ask me to marry you? Oh, come on. Don't go getting any bright ideas, Bunny. I'm not ready for marriage yet. Yeah, but we're in love. Yeah, and let's keep it that way. I mean, my parents got married in high school, and now they're divorced. That would never happen to us. That's what they said. And now they hate each other. We're in love. Let's just take it nice and easy. All right. You're so sensible. I guess that's why I love you so much. Come on, let's get dressedbefore Miss Cello comes back. OK. [music playing] [screams] [groans] [screams] I'll be right back. I got to get my sweater, OK? All right. Hurry up. Girls. Oh. [screams] No! Chet. [screams] Chet, come quick! [screams] CHET: What is it? What? Jesus Christ. Who could have done this? Henry. Henry did it. I thought he was crazy, but Inever thought he'd go this far. God, this is horrible. Let's get out of here. [screams] Oh, no! Oh, Chet! Oh my god. Please, Chet, do something. I'll do something. I'll kill this son of a bitch. [grunts] KEVIN: [laughs] Ah, my arm! Somebody's got my arm. Son of a bitch! KEVIN: Pick on somebody your own size! Oh my god, Chet! KEVIN: Oh, so you want to get into the act? Help me! There's somebody on top of me. KEVIN: [laughs] Bunny, get up! There's somebody on top of me. Come on, there's nothing on top of you. Help. Get him off of me. There's nothing on top you. Get up! KEVIN: [laughs] [grunts] KEVIN: [laughs] Oh, come on. You're swinging like a girl. Missed, missed! Oh! Oh, my nose! BUNNY: Chet, over there! That's his blood! KEVIN: [groans] Come on! Come on! KEVIN: [laughs] CHET: Come on! KEVIN: [laughs] Die! Die, you son of a bitch! Die! [crackling] Chet, look! What? Ah! Mr. Smith? 'Tis I, your friendlyneighborhood invisible maniac. CHET: But why? Why not? Damn! No more serum. BUNNY: [sobs] No! No! [squelch] Ah! Ah-ha! The serum has brought outthe best and the worst in me. The beauty of being invisible-- neurotransmitters firingnothing by pure sexual energy. I've never felt stronger. But it's time to move on. Too many nubile, young students who haven't had a chance to meetthe irresistible Dr. Smith. [laughs] Chet, you're still alive. How astute of you, Dr. Dornwinkle. How did you know my last name? I read it in the funny papers. Life lesson number one-- never believe everythingyou read in the newspapers. Thanks for the tip. Now, prepare to die. Life lesson number two-- never threaten the invisible maniac. [grunts] Ha! Where are you, you jerk? Come out! KEVIN: Over here, football star! Die, you invisible jerk! [gunshot] [grunts] KEVIN: Surprise! [laughs] Here, let me give you a hand. No. No! Don't touch that! No! No! Get over here. [grunts] [punches landing] CHET: God damn it. [both grunting] KEVIN: Come on! Get over here! Get over here. CHET: Come on and fight me.KEVIN: Where are you? CHET: Come on! KEVIN: Where are you? CHET: Fight me! KEVIN: Oh, ah! [both grunting] [knocking on door] OFFICER: Open up! Police! KEVIN: Come here! Where are you? OFFICER: Open up! Open the door right now, or we'll break it down. KEVIN: Fight me! Come on. OFFICER: Police. Open up. [gunshot] Holy Jesus, look at that. It looks like this is the place. Looks like Dornwinkle saved this city a long, expensive trial. That anonymous tip paid off. Sure did. Dornwinkle, you bastard. Why didn't you think of doing this before you killed all those kids? What would make somebodyblow their head off like that? Station two, this is 3 Charles. We've got a suicide. KEVIN: [laughs] Good evening. I'm Tammy Edwards. And here's our top story tonight.

Dornwinkle's final murder was his own by fatal gunshot to the face. Dornwinkle was-- [gasps] KEVIN: [laughs] [music playing] [SINGING] What you don't know won't hurt you. But what you don't see might kill. There's a maniac on the streets at night, looking for some kind of thrill. He don't cast no reflectionsor shadows in the night. He's a cold-blooded killer with an attitude, and he's really out ofsite, 'cause he's invisible. Man of destruction, don't you know they have a one-track mind? Invisible, he's a smooth operator, and he's gonna take his own sweet time. Invisible, and if you don't believe it, I think you're gonna change your mind. Invisible, he got a bad reputation. He can [inaudible]. Better lock your windows and your doors and stay inside tonight, 'causethere's evil in the frozen air with a wicked appetite. His mode is not transparent,but he don't really care. You can always see right throughhim as if he wasn't there, 'cause he's invisible. Man of destruction, don't youknow he got a one-track mind?
