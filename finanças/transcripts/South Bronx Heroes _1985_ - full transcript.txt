[MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING - "HAPPY SONG"] -Scott, where are you? [DOOR CREAKING] [MUSIC PLAYING] Come on, Scott, we don't have all day. -I don't feel like it. -Don't be like that. We talked about this, didn't we? -I thought you said I didn't have to do this anymore. -That's not what I said, Scott. [SIGHING] We don't have all day, OK? Just come on, sit down, and do what you're supposed to, huh? You're going to have to earn your meals in this house, you understand me? Now take off your clothes. You will do as I say. You understand me? Take your clothes off. I want this done right the first time, understand me? Get undressed, Scott. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Mrs. Bennett and I have come to love you very much. We'd like you to be a permanent member of this family. You'd like that, wouldn't you? You and Paul are very close, aren't you? -He's the only family I got. -Well, now you have Mrs. Bennett and myself as your family. We have a problem, Michelle. We can't afford to have both you and Paul live here. Paul will have to live with another family. -What are you talking about? Paul wouldn't go anywhere without me. -Yeah, Bennett, what are you talking about? From the looks of things around here, you can afford to keep us living in style for quite a while. -And you know, you've been more trouble since-- -I don't care what you say! You're not splitting me and Michelle up. If I go, she goes-- and if you don't like that-- send us both back. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Oh shit! Let's go. [MUSIC PLAYING] [CROWD CHATTER] MOTHER: Where are the people? You lost the people already? Let me see. Were there people there? -I'm pretending. MOTHER: Oh, that's good. Let's see what your sister got for Christmas. She's going to open a present. Let's see what's in her present. -What? -Let's see what she got as a present. -[INAUDIBLE] Santa Claus. -I know. Is that from Santa Claus? [INAUDIBLE] Uh-huh. -Thank you. -You're welcome. -[SIGHING] [FAMILY CHATTER] -Well? -They're gone. -All of them? -No, they only took the ones that are most incriminating. That punk knew exactly what he was taking. -I don't think they'd go to the police, and they wouldn't believe them anyway, two runaway kids like that. -No, we'll just have to find them before they think of anything. Hey, at least they couldn't have gotten that far by now. -This is it? -This is the right address. -But there's nothing here. Are you sure? -Positive. See for yourself. Aunt Rose gave it to me at Daddy's funeral. She said if we ever needed her, this is she lives. I guess she moved while we didn't need her. [SIGHING] It'll be all right, Michelle. You'll see. Everything will work out. I promise. Come on. Come on, Michelle. [MUSIC PLAYING] [TRAIN RUMBLING] [MUSIC PLAYING] -Come on, JR. Come on, baby. Come on, J.

Thank you. -This nigger is crazy. -Put your hand out, boy. -My watch. -Take off the watch, baby. -All right, sit down,assholes. Everybody sit down. -Sit down for what? [COCKING GUN] -Oh, sit, sit. -Take your shoes off! [CHATTER] Smile, boy! [MUSIC PLAYING] What the fuck, asshole. Why don't you buy some new socks, punk? You can't do no funky-ass sneakers and shit. -What you going to do now, man? -Here's a gift for you guys. -Thank you. -What are you going to do with us? -Come on, man. You got our sneakers, you got all our stuff, man. Let us go. [MUSIC PLAYING] -What the hell is he on, man? -Shut up, man, shut up. -Yo, don't do that. Yo, no, don't do that. Yo, don't light that! -He's fucking burning our shit! [MUSIC PLAYING] -Come on, JR. Let's get out of here. -Hey, this doesn't look that bad. -No way! -Come on. -No. -Come on, it's as good as place as any. Welcome to your new home. [MUSIC PLAYING] -I'm afraid, Paul. I don't like it here. -Stop being such a fraidy cat. There's nothing to worry about. -What's the matter? -Don't you hear it? -Hear what? -Listen. -It sounds like someone crying. -Stay here. [MUSIC PLAYING] Hello? Anybody there? [MUSIC PLAYING] -[LAUGHING] -What's so funny, stupid? -Open your eyes, fraidy cat, come here. Ugh. -Oh look, Paul, he's beautiful. Know what I'm going to call him? -What? -Freddy. -Freddy? -Yeah, that way when you call me fraidy cat I think you're talking to him. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] -Who is it? TONY: Candygram. Merry Christmas. Hey, Chrissy, Chrissy, come on, it's Tony. Chrissy, I know you miss me. -You got a lot of nerve showing up after what you did. Why don't you stay with one of your women? -I'm sentimental. I miss the old place, and I miss you. [SINGING] You are so beautiful. -Cut it, Tony. When they let you out? -Last month. If you ever go to jail, don't go to jail in Mexico. -You lucky I didn't fly down there and testify against you. -Chrissy, you know, you're so nice that I got you a present. I missed you in Mexico, and you always wanted a mink, so I got something from you. Come on, open it up. It's for you. Come on, open it. Tear it open. Go ahead. -[SCREAMING] What's that? -Hey, JR, I want to give you to Chrissy. -You get that thing away from me! -It's a ferret. I couldn't afford a min, so I got you a ferret-- and his name's JR. [LAUGHING] Hey, Chrissy, you got a boyfriend yet? -What? -I said, you getting laid yet? -What'd you say? -You know, you getting paid yet or you still a student at that--what's that-- barnyard school? -Barnard College. I graduated. I'm a teacher. -You hear that? Tony's sister's a big time professor. What do you think they call her, JR? Missy Chrissy? -I'm not a professor, I'm a substitute. -Yeah, what are they paying you? -Not enough to support you. -Hear that, JR. I work my fingers to the bone, and what do I get? No respect, not even in my own house. -This isn't your house. You don't pay the bills here. -I thought it was our house, Chrissy. -Yeah, when we grew up a long, long, long time ago, but you have no claims on anything here now. -So you kept it the same? Hi, JR. Still looks like shit, doesn't it, JR? [MUSIC PLAYING] [ARGUING] [MUSIC PLAYING] -OK, this is the last time you going-- this is the last time you're going we're going to mess with you-- understand? Last time! People mess with-- you done shit-- people mess. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Stay. [POLICE SIRENS] [MUSIC PLAYING] [BELL CHIMING] -And you were the one that said, I looked like a Beverly Hillbilly, right? CHRISSY: Right, you look like a greaser. -Uh-huh. CHRISSY: Tony, can I come out now? -No. CHRISSY: I'll keep my eyes closed. What are you up to? -Don't worry about it. Don't worry about it, just relax, and leave Christmas to your big brother. CHRISSY: This better now be another trick! -It's not a trick. Just stay in your boudoir until I call you, and say, I'm ready, because tonight we're stepping out. CHRISSY: What are you going to use for money? -Who needs money when you got glide in your stride, pep in your step, and class up the-- CHRISSY: Tony! -Excuse the outburst, baby. Scarlett O'Hara, you may come out now. Dark Gable is ready. -Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn. -Hey, cleaner than the Board of Health, or what? -Where'd you find that? -It's granddad's, all of it. These old clothes are going to come back into style, and when they do, I'm going to be ready. -Tony, I have to-- -Hey, hey, hey, don't talk. Tonight is our night. I got brown champagne. Huh? 1984, a good week. Now Gramps doesn't know I'm here yet, so what I want to do is that after we have this toast, I'm going to go up and surprise the old geezer. You know how he loves to see us together, and dressed up. -Tony, you didn't get my letter? -No, I told you I didn't get a letter. -Tony, a lot has happened since you've been away. -He doesn't know I was in jail, does he? -No, I didn't tell him. Tony, Grandpa had an accident. He fell on the ice. They me take him home from the hospital, so I brought him here. They said I should have a nurse to take care of him. I barely had enough money to pay for the medicine. I had to go out to work. He was alone, and he tried to walk. I found him here, lying on the floor dead. I thought you knew. I wrote you. -(VOICEOVER) Grandpa, you know my Daddy? -Yeah. -What kind of a man was he? -What kind of a question is that? -I don't know. Uncle Derek called him a fool, said only fools get themselves killed. -Your Uncle Derek said that to you? -Yeah. -Well, you know your Uncle Derek. His light's on, but there ain't nobody home. Your Daddy wasn't no fool. No, sir. He just didn't understand somethings. -Hello, old man. Why don't you just reach into your pocket and let me have your wallet? -Excuse me. -I said, let me have your wallet. -Please, Mister, please. Please don't hurt me and my grandson. -I'm not going to ask you again. Now handover the wallet! -Don't hurt us, Mister. [MUSIC PLAYING] I don't like nobody bothering my money. -Ugh! -When you talk to me, you speak clearly, distinctly, and you call me sir! Is that clear? -Yes, sir. -You take a hike, and don't you never, ever come back in this neighborhood and bother me and my grandson, or I'm going to blow your nuts into so many little pieces, the squirrels can't find them. Now git! [MUSIC PLAYING] -I didn't know you had gun, Grandpa. -Well, it ain't much, but it gets the job done. Here. [MUSIC PLAYING] -The other day you asked me what I wanted to be-- rich, rich-- that's what I want to be because if we had the money to pay for medicine and a nurse, he'd be alive today. Money is what matters, Chrissy. [MUSIC PLAYING - "PAUL'S SONG"] -Now if you're a good little girl, Santa Claus is going to bring you something nice. -Oh sure, and he won't even have to come through the chimney, he can just come to the hole in the roof. -I guess you're getting a bit big to believe in Santa Claus. -I haven't believed in Santa Claus since I was four. -I never knew that. Why didn't you tell me? -I figured if you were that dumb to believe I believed it, why make you feel any dumber? -My sister, [INAUDIBLE]. Well, since you don't believe in Santa Claus, I might as well give you your gift now. -Gift? Nice wrapping. -Makeshift. -Oh Paul, it's wonderful. Thank you. -Now you and Freddy have a playmate. Merry Christmas, Michelle. -Merry Christmas, Paul. [MUSIC PLAYING - "NO ONE REALLY KNOWS ME"] -Michelle, I'm back. -Did you get any milk for Freddy? -Yeah, I think there's some fish in here, too. At least it smells like it. -Is it cold out? -It's freezing. I think it's going to snow. [MUSIC PLAYING - "NO ONE REALLY KNOWS ME"] Hey, we've got a bowl, and we even got a donut. You want a bite? -No. -Mm. [MUSIC PLAYING - "NO ONE REALLY KNOWS ME"] What I wouldn't give for a good, hot meal. -Or a hot bath. -Yeah, we sure are starting to smell a little nasty. -We sure are. -Don't worry about it. I'll figure out something. -I hope so. -Eat something. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Yo, ain't that the one that burned our fucking sneakers? -Yeah, that's him. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Hey, are you feeling OK? Yeah, I'm just tired. Paul, how much longer do we have here? We can't find Aunt Rose anywhere around here. Why don't we go back? It wasn't that bad. -We just can't go back. We'll be OK here. Besides, we're having fun, right? Come on, you and Freddy get ready for bed. It's getting late. -Paul, read me a bed time story, like Mommy used to? -OK, which one? -Remember the one about the mean, little nasty guy who wanted to kidnap the queen's daughter? -You mean Rumpelstiltskin? -Yeah, that's the one. -OK, but you gotta promise to go right to bed, OK? -OK. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Uh, you ready? OK. There was once a miller who was very poor, but he had a beautiful daughter, and the thought struck him that he would speak about her to the king. -So he obtained an audience, and he told the king he had a daughter who could spin straw into gold. Hmm. Then said the king. This is a quality which pleases me well. If your daughter is, as you say, so very skillful, bring her to the castle tomorrow morning, and I will see what she can do. Hmm. The miller next day-- -Dad? -Took his daughter-- what? -How long does Mommy have to stay in the hospital? -Well, she'll be coming home soon. She just has to take a few more tests. -What kind of tests? -Well, you see, the doctors are treating her, and she'll be as good as new, even better. -I want Mommy to be as good as new. -So do I, Paul. So do I. Your mother told me to tell you that she misses you very much, and she loves you. -I miss her, too. Can I go with you to see her tomorrow? -We'll see. It's getting late. Go to sleep, son. -I love you, Dad. -I love you, son. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Excuse me, you got a minute? -Yeah. You see these two kids in the neighborhood? A little girl about this high, little guy? -No. -No, I haven't. -No? -Nah, I ain't seen them. What makes you think they're around here? -Just a hunch, and there's a $500 reward for anyone who finds them. -$500? You must want them back pretty bad. -Do me a favor. Here's my number. If you see them around, give me a call, and you can make it collect. -O'Connor, huh? Is it true what they say about the Irish, O'Connor? -What's that? -Just give me a call, OK? [MUSIC PLAYING - "PAUL'S SONG"] -It's just not fair because I don't even understand everything good. Little Ralph, come here. This son of a bitch, he calls me into his office, and tells me he has to let me go, huh? This bastard says, they don't want no abusive people working there. I mean, this slimy creep told me that I was abusive! Am I abusive, Ralph, huh? -Hey, relax, come on. -Am I abusive, huh? No, you're not, you're not--relax. -Dad? -What? -Can we go home now? Michelle and I have school tomorrow. -How many times did I tell you, stop interrupting when I'm talking, huh? How many times? -Hey, Mack, why don't you leave the kid alone? Go home. It's late. You had enough. -Who's talking to you? Why don't you mind your own goddamn-- because I'm talking to my son here. -Come on, go home. -Hey, both of you, come on. Listen, I don't want no fighting in here. Hey, and look, you've had enough. And these kids, they should be going home. Just get out of here. -You sure [INAUDIBLE] spoil a goddamn conversation. I wish it was you who were dead, instead of your mother. -Hey, big hands, why don't you pick on somebody your own size? -My own size? Come on here. Come on over here. Come on over here. I'm going to trim your beard. Come on! Come on! [SHOUTING] [MUSIC PLAYING] -Scott? Scott, you down here, buddy? Scott? Scott? What are you doing under the desk? Oh, it's all right. It's all right, Scott. Tell me what happened. -I can't. -Sure you can. We're buddies, aren't we? You can trust me. -He hit me. -Who hit you? -Was it O'Connor? Did O'Connor hit you, Scott? -Was it Bennett? Did Mr. Bennett hit you, Scott? Why? -Because he disobeyed me, and I don't tolerate anybody not obeying my orders. -You have no right hitting Scott like that. He's only a little kid. -No, little brat's more like it. Listen, I know how to deal with Scott, huh? So why don't you mind your own business and stop sticking your nose where it doesn't belong. -You're not my father, Bennett, and you're not Scott's father either. My father wouldn't hit his kid. -Your father was a drunk and a bum. -He was not. My, my father was a good man. My father loved me. -No, he loved his bottle. Remember something, you're just a ward of the State. That's why you're in this foster home. That's why all the kids are in this foster home. Nobody wants you. -That's not true! Aunt Rose wanted us, only she was too poor. -Poor, poor Aunt Rose. [LAUGHING] When are you going to grow up, Paul? Your Aunt Rose doesn't want you. She only wanted to use you to get the money as an excuse. -Was not! You're a liar! -Now listen you punk, don't try anything. Maybe I should teach you some respect, huh, teach you a lesson you won't forget. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Hey, candy ears, what's happening? -Nothing. -I was just throwing you a compliment. -You can keep it. -Where'd you steal the headphones from? -Satisfaction. I can't get no. -Why don't you get a job? -Huh? -Why don't you get a job? -Can't hear you. I can't get no. -Look for a job! -Hey, hey, hey. Don't you know that unemployment is up, and if I were to get a job, I'd be taking a good job away from some poor guy that really needs one? I couldn't do that. Besides, no one makes money doing a good nine to five anyway. -Shut up. -That time of the month again, huh? [POLICE SIRENS] -I was down at the corner store. -You get me something to eat? -A cop came in. -Huh? -A cop came in looking for a certain someone. Don't play with that. -Wanted to know the whereabouts of a certain someone. He was offering a reward, $500. -Was he a white guy, dark hair? Was he with a Black guy, heavy set? -Oh you mean those two FBI men that were looking for you before? No, it wasn't them. Tall guy, beard, blondish hair. They weren't looking for you this time. -Who's he looking for? -Two little white kids, runaways, 14 and 11. -And what would they be doing in the South Bronx? -Maybe they wanted to see how the other half lived. -Do you see that? Do you see that? Ghetto kids disappear every day, right? These two little kids disappear, right? They decide they don't like the new video game Daddy bought, so they run away, and concerned cops come running in with reward money. How much reward money would they offer if you disappeared? I can see it right now. Hey Joe, another colored girl has disappeared in the South Bronx. That's good, Bill, have another beer. [MUSIC PLAYING] [SHOUTING] [MUSIC PLAYING] -Ooh. -He's got a gun. He's got a gun. Break him. -I'm going to slice this fucking rag. [MUSIC PLAYING] -[YELLING] -You a dead man. -Present from my Granddaddy. [MUSIC PLAYING] [HUMMING - "JINGLE BELLS"] [MUSIC PLAYING] -Yo, get back here! Stop him! He robbed me! Stop him! [MUSIC PLAYING] -Michelle! Michelle? Michelle, where are you? Michelle, stop playing games. Michelle? Oh, Michelle. Rah! I'll give you three seconds to get out here. One, two, two and 1/2, two and 3/4, two and 8/16. Michelle, come out here. -Boo! -I'm going to get you for that. You think you're funny, huh? I want you to promise me you'll never do that again. -Paul, you're hurting me. Stop! -I want you to promise me. -I promise. -And I want you to say, Paul is the master supreme. -That's it. -You slapped me. -I'm sorry, Paul, I didn't mean to. -I thought something happened to you. -I won't hide from you again, Paul. I'm sorry. -OK, Rocky. Is that a promise? -Its a promise. -Oh, I brought you something. -What is it, Paul? -Designer jeans. -They should fit. -I'll go try them on. [MUSIC PLAYING - "REVENGE RAP"] -Come on! -Couldn't you find us a place where we don't have to climb over something? -Honestly, Paul, first you climb a mountain, and end up in the dumps, and now you expect me climb a fence. -Quit exaggerating. It was just a hill. Now come on. -No way. What do I look like anyhow? -Stop being such a baby. If you want a bath, then climb. -(MOCKINGLY) If you want a bath, then climb. -What was that? -Oh shut up! --[INAUDIBLE] Come on, climb the fence, you faggot. You can't even climb a fence. Come on. -Don't rush me. I'm coming. -Let's go. You're so slow. -Where do you find these places? -I look them up in the "Yellow Pages," what do you think? Come on. Come on. Shh. Looks like no one's home. -Not again. -Quit complaining, you're giving me a headache. Now wait here while I check the rest of the apartment. Shh. [MUSIC PLAYING] It looks like the coast is clear. Can you handle this climb? -Go fly a kite. [MUSIC PLAYING] -The bathroom's right there, stinky. P-U. -Shut up, skunk foot. Don't take all day. [MUSIC PLAYING] Come on, Michelle. There's someone at the door. Michelle, hurry it up. Come on. Michelle, Michelle, come on. Can't find my [INAUDIBLE]. -Don't worry about it. Let's go. Come on. Let's go. -Get out of here, you can't-- -Come on. -Hey, man. -Look at that little kid. Oh, that's sick, Tony. -Kiddie porno. -That's real sick. -The kid's carrying kiddie porno with him. [HEAVY BREATHING] -I'm going to have a heart attack. Oh, -Oh, ah shit. -What's the matter? -Nothing, just wait here. I gotta get something. -What? -Just stop asking so many questions, and stay here. -I don't like staying here by myself. Let me come with you wherever you're going. -Would you stay here, and quit complaining? -Ow, that hurts. -I'll be back as soon as I can. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Looking for something? What's the matter? Ain't you never seen an American before? Where's your little friend? -I'm alone. -Listen up, junior flip, because I'm going to give you the best free advice this side of the Bronx. Rule number one, don't break it anyone's apartment. And rule number two, don't break into someone's apartment and get caught. And rule number three, don't ever take a shower in my place man, and not have the common decency to wash the funk off the floor. -We didn't mean-- -Hey man, if I want you to talk. I'm going to throw you a peanut. Unit then, why don't you just shut up? [MUSIC PLAYING] Now why don't you just take your little prepubescent self up into my abode and tell me to what I owe the pleasure of your company. -Don't push me. -Hey, what are you doing in my house, man? -I just came to get something. -Yeah, what? The radio or the TV? -Neither. -Well, what then? -Nothing. -Hey man, you just some kind of thief, or you push porno, too, huh? -We don't push anything. -Oh, well, what are the little pretty pictures for? Just the old five-finger romance, is that it? -Five finger? Go to hell! -Hey midget, as far as I'm concerned, You're a little rude, funky, bodacious, no-class kid, who is not only out of his neighborhood, but is out of his little "Leave It to Beaver" mind. -Now if you want the chance to finish going through puberty, why don't you and I just go pick up your little girlfriend, I'll take you back to the suburbs, and cash you in. -She's not my girlfriend, she's my sister. -Oh, now she's your sister. Well, enough talk, I'm taking you home. You know, it's a good thing I don't have you busted, man. It's just that I'm a Capricorn, I'm kindhearted, plus that I want to keep my karma good. Now let's go. -I can't! -Junior flip, I'm tired out, man. You made me miss "Star Trek"-- plus that I got high blood pressure-- now don't make me have to kick your ass. -Just give me the photos. -Hey, Chrissy! [KNOCKING] Chrissy! Hey,Chrissy. Chrissy, look at this. -Don't yell, Tony. -Hey Chrissy, we got a visitor here. Old Dennis the Menace just got busted trying to take another shower, didn't you, Dennis? What did you say the kids were worth? -$500. Where's the girl? -He says the girl's his sister. -She is my sister, and we're worth a lot more money than that if you play it right. -If you play what right? -Just give me the pictures. -Hey man, you don't get shit until I know what you're talking about. Play what right? -The Polaroids, they're worth a lot of money to the right person. -How much money, man? -As much as you can get. -Now why don't you start from the beginning and go to the end, and don't you be bullshitting. [COINS DROPPING] [TELEPHONE RINGING] -Hello. I'm calling about the two kids. -What two kids? -You know what two kids, and I know where they're at. -OK. Where are they? -[LAUGHING] Not so fast. Let's play "Dialing for Dollars. " Behind Door number one do I hear a reward? -OK, I get the kids, and you get your $500. -[LAUGHING] $500? Man, I spend more than that on "Pacman" in a week, let alone if I play "Donkey Kong." You know, everybody's putting down my clothes, man. They say I look like a bum, so I want a new double-breasted Armani suit with a Brooks Brothers tie. My sister's tired of watching the Flintstones in black and white, so we want some yabba, dabba, do in color, baby. I want one of them big Japanese TVs. You know, with all the gadgets and shit, that remote control stuff. I tell you what, man. Put another zero on that. I'll make you a break. Make it $5,000. -$5,000? Listen, I'm in no mood for practical jokes, OK? -Yeah, those pictures don't look like practical jokes to me, man. -What pictures? -The kind of pictures that look like they're worth $10,000, man. And all this talking is making my phone bill go up. -(WHISPERING) Find out who it is. -Listen, who the hell is this? -I'm the Captain of the USS Enterprise. That's not important to you. What's important to you is that I have what you want. -OK. Uh, tell me where they are, and I'll bring you the money. -I'll call you back later with the details, but right now you just sit tight. And I promise you one thing, this shit is not a joke. This phone will self-destruct in five seconds. [LAUGHING] -Michelle? Michelle, I thought you promised you weren't going to play games. Michelle! Where were you? -I was out looking for you. I got worried. -I thought I told you not to go outside the building. I wasn't kidding around, you know. -But I don't like-- -I don't care what you like. You just do what I tell you to do. -Paul, I-- -You know, I have enough to worry about without your whining and your bullshit all the time. -Paul-- -Do you think I like living like this? I can't stand it any more. I want to have some friends, some people I can talk to, my own age. I want to go on dates. I want to go to school. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Me, too. [MUSIC PLAYING] -I'm sorry, Michelle. [MUSIC PLAYING] -I finally got this book together. Can you believe it? -I know, I know, it looks great! -I carry it with me to Paris to show it. Oh god, now Italy is telling me if I can come over right away, but I think I'll go to Paris first and then Italy. -Yeah? -You going to go? -Of course, of course. Yeah. -We'll find someplace in Paris to stay,and maybe we'll go there first, and then after-- -Japan. We've got the bug. -Yeah. We've got to work on this show here. Like Calvin Klein, of-- -Excuse me, do you have the correct time? -3:00. -Anyway, so we've got to get this. [INAUDIBLE] [LAUGHING] -You guys must be models, huh? Is that you? That's nice. And you're a model, too, huh? -No, I'm just in the park right now, networking. -Anyway, this is the picture they're crazy about. They want me to send it over right away. -I like that one. I like that one. -Listen, I hate to bother you guys, but I want to be a model-- -You are bothering us. -You think I could be a model? --[LAUGHING] You're much too short, and besides, We want to be alone. -Motherfuck! [MUSIC PLAYING] [LAUGHTER] -What's the matter, old man, you getting tired? What are you doing with a pet ferret anyway? The thing looks like a giant rat. -Hey video face, I let you talk about my sister, I even let you talk about my mother, but you crack on JR, and I might have to stunt your growth. He's like a brother to me. He's the only friend I had when I got out of the joint. -Oh yeah? What were you in for, jaywalking? -Try armed robbery. -Oh, bull. -Whim shit, I'm starting to like you less and less. -That's good because I never liked you at all. -You know, I could just turn your ass over to the cops. -You could. Then you wouldn't get all that green stuff from Mr. Bennett. -Yeah, It might be worth it just to see your cute little ass behind bars, trying to get a tan. -You should know all about cute little asses, considering you were in jail and all. -Don't push it with me, [INAUDIBLE]. -Don't damage the merchandise. -Is that you? -Yeah, that's me. This is Mogley. She was my favorite doll. I used to love her so much, I tried to take her in the bathtub with me, she got water soaked, and every time I squeezed her after that, she'd make me all wet. -Oh, that's Tony. Isn't he cute? He used to always get in big trouble. I remember, he took all the sugar out of the sugar bowl, and filled it up with salt. My mother was making her last cup of coffee, and she put two tablespoons of salt. Oh, she was so made, she beat the hell out of Tony. That's Tony and I together. When we were younger, we were so close, I used to follow him anywhere. -Just like me and Paul. -Yeah, just like you and Paul. -Hey junior flip, you and your sister, you guys ever get it on in Bennett's movies? -You know, you're sick. [MUSIC PLAYING - "MAKIN IT REAL"] -Hey, I didn't mean that. -Oh yeah? How would you like it if someone wanted to put your sister in a porno film? [BIRDS CHIRPING] -I'd grab him by his ears. I'd ring his neck, and then I'd bury him up to his ankles in fresh camel shit. All except for his nostrils. I'd put two straws there so he could breathe. And then I'd put red ants down them straws so they'd eat his face, and then I'd have JR pee all over him. -Bennett mightn't like that. -The only trouble is how we make it look like an accident? -Oh, that's easy, just run over him with a truck a few times. -I like the way you think. You can go far with an attitude like that. Those pictures were weird. -That's nothing compared to what they did to Scott. -Who's Scott? -(VOICEOVER) He hit me. -Scott was my foster brother at the Bennett's. We shared a room together. He was a great little artist. He used to love to draw pictures. He drew this. [MUSIC PLAYING] He didn't talk much. I guess his parents were dead. He never really talked about them. He didn't have any friends, beside me and Michelle. The thing I remember about him most was that he'd always cry himself to sleep all the time. I never knew why, until one day I walked into out room, and saw him without his shirt on. His whole back was covered with scars, like someone beat him with a belt. I asked him what happened, but he wouldn't tell me. I know what happened. I knew who did it. It was Bennett. He was only six years old, and Bennett was beating him with a belt. What kind of man would beat up on a little kid? What kind of man would make a little kid do that stuff? -What happened to him? -They say he ran away, but I don't believe it. I found his stuff in the garbage can. His crayons and his drawings. That's why we can't go back there. [MUSIC PLAYING] -You find a place to meet Bennett? -Yeah, tomorrow's payday. -Where's Paul? He went back to the abandoned building to get his stuff. -Why didn't you go with him? He shouldn't be roaming the streets alone. -Hey, don't you start playing mama with me now, and don't you worry about Paul. He's a tough little kid. -Michelle's asleep. You should have heard some of those stories she told me. Those kids have been through hell already. Money isn't everything. -Yeah? Get you a new color TV, a lot of clothes, medical care for an old man like your grandfather. -Where you going? -I'm going out, make a phone call, and buy me a suit. -To do what in? To do whatever I do in style. [MUSIC PLAYING] -I'll teach you some respect, huh? [MUSIC PLAYING] Sometimes I wish it was you that was dead, instead of your mother. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Well, Tweedle Dee, where's Tweedle Dum? -You're a funny man. We got your message. -Yeah. -Yeah, let me see what you got. And you're sure we can-- you're sure we can count on these kids? -Yeah, they do whatever Uncle Tony tells them to do. -They better because you're in way over your head with this one, wise guy. -If I wasn't in over my head, you wouldn't be in it at all, right? I know how to cover my ass. -You got a lousy sense of direction. -My sense of direction, my ass. Why don't we do it my way? -All right. We do it your way, but if you screw up, Tony, I'm going to send Tweedle Dum around, and he's going to put your ass in a vise, and he's going to squeeze so hard, you'll wish you were back in that jail in Mexico. -Don't go away mad, just go away, huh? -Funny man. [BIRDS CHIRPING] [MUSIC PLAYING] -Hey, Paul. [MUSIC PLAYING] -I'm disappointed, Bennett. You're 33 seconds late. -Cut the bullshit, and let's get down to business, huh? -Well, you're pretty anxious, aren't you, Bennett? I have what you want. Now show me what I want. -Yeah, they're all here. OK, kids, let's go. -Frisk him, baby. -What is this? -You got your money. -Yeah, that money was for the pictures, and these little kids are going to extra. -Hey, that wasn't part of the deal. -What do you think you're doing? That wasn't part of the plan. -Well, I'm altering the plan, baby. -Tony, you can't do that. -I can, and I will. -You bastard, you shut us out. I knew I couldn't trust you. Well, we're not going back. -Yeah? [MUSIC PLAYING] [SCREECHING TIRES] -Man, if you shoot me, they're going to put your little ass away for good, baby, for good! -I don't care! [GUNSHOT] You're next, Bennett. This is for Scott! -O'Connor! -Hold it! FBI! [MUSIC PLAYING] -I wouldn't do that. You're under arrest. -What the hell you talking about? -Shut up! -Hey, Charlie, read Mr. Bennett his rights, and get him the hell out of here. -Turn around. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you. You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford one, the court will provide one. Do you understand your rights? [LAUGHTER] I did good? -[INAUDIBLE] you did good. You scare the hell out of that mother or what? -I still think it was a half-assed idea. -Makes you look like Mutt and Jeff in those suits. -Hey man, you going to play dead, play dead in style. -I thought it was a great idea. -That's cause you people think dumb. -And you're jealous? -Dumb. -Yeah, but these photos are going to put Mr. Bennett away for a long time. -Well, there's plenty more where they came from. I'll testify against those bastards. -Me, too. -What's going to happen to the kids? -The kids have nothing to worry about because we'll have to find them a new home. -I hope you find some people more reliable than the Bennett's. -We'll see to it with time. -Yeah, you do that. -Say, uh, Tony, I believe you have a little evidence for us. -Evidence? -Money. -Oh, oh, there goes our color TV. -And um, you know, you might have made a few enemies, so keep a low profile, will you? -Take that hat off your head. -Look, we'll wait for you back at the car. -Hey! Don't I get me babysitting money? -Babysitting money? Who you calling baby, Bozo? -So is your brother an actor, or not? -A little hammy on the dying part, but he did OK. -Go ahead now. -Jesus Christ, I didn't plan on this, man. -Will you keep your mouth shut? -I'll take good care of Freddy for you. -Thanks. -If you ever need anything, just call. -So you finally got your stuff on Bennett. It wasn't as good as running him over with the truck, but I guess it'll do. [MUSIC PLAYING] -I guess this is goodbye. -Goodbye, Tony. -Hey Michelle, the next time you and Paul want to take a shower, give us a call. I'll even let you come in through the front door instead of using the window, all right? -[LAUGHING] [MUSIC PLAYING - "DON'T LET LIFE FADE"]
