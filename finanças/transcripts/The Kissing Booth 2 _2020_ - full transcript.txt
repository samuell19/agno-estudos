Considering where we left off, I'm guessing you might have a few questions. Well, from the moment I told Noah... I love you. ...till the moment when he finally left, a whole lot of stuff happened. Let me bring you up to speed... As soon as school ended, the Flynns opened up their beach house. Noah and I spent the whole summer there. Oh, my gosh! Got an awesome gift... Played board games till three in the morning. Made sparks fly. This time on the beach. Said hi to an old friend, watched a gorgeous sunset... ...watched Noah sleep, watched Noah try to rollerblade, watched the sun come up in my favorite way, and then, just like that, exactly 27 days ago, my heart flew away. After Noah left, it was hard. He said he wanted to make long-distance work, but I decided to be a grown-up about things and to give Noah his space. I guess that's the kind of maturity that comes from being a senior. In other words, I was okay. Meanwhile, I did everything I could to keep my mind off the fact That Noah was 3,000 miles away. Like I started working on my college essay, started a podcast about video games with Lee. - Game On! - Already got subscribers, - thank you very much. - Foreign Danger! And finally dominated my nemesis on Xbox... Watched Ultimate Frisbee at the beach house, watched '80s movies with Lee and Rachel, watched Lee fall completely in love, -watched Lee get a super buff bod, -Ooh! Watched girls watching Lee's super buff bod, applied for a passport, applied for a credit card, even applied with Lee to our dream college. Rule number 19: always go to the same school as your bestie. And for us, when it comes to college, that means the University of California at Berkeley. UC Berkeley is this totally dope, completely amazing school in Northern California. Lee and I have dreamed of going there ever since we found out that's where our moms became besties. It has a really cool tower, hill rolling for good luck, famous Insta squirrels, and a cool meme page. This one's for you, Mom. Took Brad to the arcade, took Lee and Rachel hiking, took a naughty photo for Noah, chickened out about sending it though. And the last thing I took was one final moment all to myself. By the end of the summer, I was feeling pretty sorted out about things with Noah. He was where he was supposed to be, and I was where I was supposed to be. And if it works out for us, great! But if not, that would be okay too. Like I said, I was okay... mostly. And here I am getting ready for my first day of school, and everything seems... different somehow. There she is. Last first day! I gotta go. Mmm! Love you. Love you. - Love you more. - All right, I'm gonna... What up? What up? Oh, what is this? Open it. Okay! Very funny. Oh, what can I say? I thought you might need a pair of those back-up back-ups this time. Hey! You should try those on, though. I think they would look quite slimming. Hey, uh... where are you... Where are you going? School's that way. Going to get Rachel. Oh. Gotcha. What's up, foxy lady? Yeah, right. As if. Oh, okay. Let's do it, y'all. What? I'm just thinking about how insanely lucky I am. All right, lovebirds. Let's go! Senior year! Hey! - What is going on? - I have no idea... I had been feeling pretty damn good about senior year. That is until everybody was looking at me Like my dog just died. - Hey, Elle. - Hey, Tuppen. Just heard about you and Noah breaking up. - I was really hoping... - No, we didn't break up. I'm sorry. I thought you guys were really great together. - I just... - That's not... We didn't... um... - Was it your decision or his? - Never mind. Ugh! Sometimes I hate high school. Good morning and welcome back, Los Angeles Country Day. We hope you all had the very best of summers and are ready for another outstanding school year. Any clubs wanting to present fall fundraiser ideas to student council - must do so today at three p.m. sharp. - We forgot about the presentation for the kissing booth! - Oh, my God. - Get busy! And our quote of the day: "The best thing to hold on to in life is each other." Beautiful words from an iconic film star, Audrey Hepburn. Well said, Audrey. Well said. Have a fantastic day. All right, everyone, let's all take out our summer reading material. That was so good. I was so surprised. Oh, and here we go. Oh, my God, Ellen, how are you? So many beautiful girls at Harvard. - Experienced girls. - And long distance is tough. Totally explains why you guys aren't posting on social anymore. Oh, actually Noah and I decided to keep it low-key on social, so we wouldn't feel pressured by it. That is so smart. Breakups are brutal. So brutal. We didn't break up, though. With different zip codes, breakups are basically automatic. - Automatic. - Oh, well. Gotta go. I wanna take a peek at the new snack that just transferred in. Saw him in homeroom. His name's Marco, and he is seriously luscious. Ooh! I'm sorry about you and Flynn. Um, okay. Thanks. Bye. I'm so sorry to interrupt. Elle Evans, there's a phone call for you in the office. It's your father. He said it's urgent. - The phone's over there, honey. - Okay. - Gosh. I hope it's nothing too serious. - Hello? What's going on with you? What? Uh... What do you mean, Dad? Why aren't you texting me back? Well... what? Um... oh, my God! That's horrible, horrible news about Aunt, um... Rose. Is everything okay? - No. - Uh... - Could I please have a moment in private? - Sure. Just give me a second. I'm stepping into the office to take a second to process this. Why are you pretending to be my dad? It was the only way I could think to get you on the phone. Oh, that is not true. No, it is true. You barely call, and when you text, you send these weird two-word text messages like, you know, "Take care," "Talk soon." Are you breaking up with me? What? No, no, no, no! The opposite. Then what? Why? Why are you ignoring me? I... I don't know, I... I guess I'm just... I'm trying to be mature and not come off like some clingy girlfriend. Elle, I told you that I wanted to make this work. I know, but people always say that when they leave. I just wanted to give you space so that you could figure out if this is really what you want. Space. Space. I don't... I don't want space. Space is not what I want, I told you. I don't want space. I want you. I want you around me all the time. I want you with me right now, actually. I just... I just want you, okay? Text me, call me, send me a messenger pigeon, whatever it is, okay? Whatever it is, just don't give me space, okay? Okay. Okay. First up are Elle Evans and Lee Flynn. Hello, everyone. Um, we are excited about this year's fundraiser and the opportunity before us. Based on the earnings from last year, we believe that it would be beneficial... Everybody in favor of Dance Club doing a kissing booth again for the fundraiser, - please signify by saying "Aye." - Aye. - Aye. - All those against, say "Nay." Nay. Wait, no, I don't actually know why I just said that. Let the record show the Ayes have it. The kissing booth is approved. Whoo! And now that that's settled, what we're all actually curious about is who you've selected for the lineup of kissers this time. Because without Flynn as a headliner to draw in business, the booth may not do so well this year. - Uh, that's a good point. - Last year is gonna be hard to top. - We... - So hard. Quite true. Thoughts? Well, actually, the thoughts we're having... Right. Right. That's a good point. Great point. Well, you know, we have decided to keep this year's list a secret. Yeah. But do not worry because I know who a lot of you are already thinking of, and the answer is yes. They will be there. Whoo! Thank you! So, we didn't actually get anyone yet, did we? - That is correct, yes. - Okay. - So how's Aunt Rose? - Oh, come on. You can stop smirking now. I miss you, jerk. I miss you more. So, you Big Man on Campus yet? No, not exactly. It's kinda different here. What do you mean? Well, uh... What's wrong? Nothing! No, nothing's wrong. Just... doesn't matter. Hey, it's okay to be homesick. I'm... I'm fine. I'm... seriously, I'm fine. It's just, you know... What about you? How about you? Have you applied to any more schools? Don't even get me started on Berkeley! If Lee and I both don't get in, I'm... Don't tell me you've only applied to one school, Elle. I know, but it's literally the only school we've ever talked about going to. Well... you know what you could do? - My God. Is he about to ask me to... - Apply here. As if I could get into Harvard. Elle, there's over 30 schools that you could apply to in Boston. And your point being that at least one of them would accept my sorry ass? No! My point being that if you don't get into Berkeley... maybe you can come to school here. With me. I'd like that. You obviously couldn't see this, but my heart just did a backflip. Um... Okay, yeah, maybe I'll think about that. Maybe you'll think about it. Okay, you can just think about it. You know, all the books you have to read if you go here, seriously... I couldn't help but think about rule number 19, but here's the thing. Who knows if I'd even get accepted into a Boston school? And if I didn't, what would be the point in telling Lee now and getting him upset over nothing? Right? You have excellent grades, great test scores, soccer, Dance Club. And I also have a podcast about video games. Oh! So you're an influencer. How many subscribers? Thirty-seven. Thirty-seven thousand! - We can work with that. - No, no, no, um... Thirty-seven. You're kidding, right? Oh. Well, uh... To get into top-tier colleges like UC Berkeley and Harvard, you really need to wow them with your personal essay. And yours is... How shall I put this? - Really? I thought I killed it. - Hmm? What? No. You didn't even wound it. So, I'm redoing my personal essay. Apparently it sucks. Oh! New level! Wonder if mine sucks. I should probably look into that. Don't want that keeping us out of Berkeley. Um, yeah. Definitely. So, have you seen the new kid Marco yet? Yeah. Devastatingly handsome. Some are even saying he's hotter than Noah. - Really? What? - Yeah. That's crazy! Oh, Lee! New level, Lee! Lee? Lee! No! Lee! We discussed this. I need a regular feeding regimen during my hands-free Ms. Pac-Man experience. What the hell is that? Top score is "MVP"? "Most Valuable Player"? Well, somebody thinks highly of themselves. I kind of always just figured we'd be number one forever. Look at me. We are going to need slushies, churros and an ass-load of quarters. Surprise! Hey, Evans. Come here. What's up? That new guy Marco, someone snagged a video of him working out. Oh, come on. How hot can this guy actually be? He can't be that hot. Hot. He's just a guy... whoa! Sweet mercy! Jeez! Hello! God! The OMGs were right! This guy is a snack indeed! Maybe an entrée! Maybe he's also the dessert too! Tell me more! No, no, no. Maybe he's the after-after dessert! He's a big meal that we're having now! Oh, shit! Sorry. - Oh!! - Sorry about that. Whoa! Oh! He could bench you, us together at the same time! Yeah, definitely. Whoa! I'm confused. Do I need glasses? Am I looking at a tray of ice cubes or a six-pack? - Am I right? It's incredible! - Shit! It's like his sweat produces its own glitter! Hello, can we get two tickets to the gun show, please? Because are those arms or cannons? Oh, my God! - It's not funny, everybody! - Whoa! If those abs had Instagram, - one million followers all day! - Wow! I'm not really a butt person, but, like, now I understand people who are! I don't know whether to lick it, smack it, bite it... - Bite it? Ugh! - I wanna do all three of those things. Oof! Oh! Dude, I'm so sorry. Just call me an earthquake, because I am legit shook right now! Whoa! What is his name again? Marco! Marco! Marco! Marco! Marco! Marco! Marco! - Marco. - Marco. Lee? Oh, my God! Oh, that made my year. You're cool. Hello, Miss Evans. Happy birthday! Hey, look, it's the "get it" girl. Baby, baby! Gosh! I bet everybody forgets by tomorrow. Well, that doesn't matter because I'm still transferring to a school on the moon. Is he really that good-looking? I'm sorry. Was my description not vivid enough? I literally described a hundred different ways Marco can get it! Awesome. I take it you're the one from the intercom? Mm-hmm, yeah. But they're, you know, already calling me the Get it Girl, but I go by Elle. I don't know. Get it Girl has a nice ring to it. Cool. So is that, like, your thing? Carry around a guitar and remind girls of horrible moments in their life? I... I didn't mean it like that. To be honest, everyone was yelling and cheering so loud, I could barely hear - what you were saying. - That is great news. Don't be embarrassed. Embarrassed? I... I am not embarrassed. Get a load of this guy! I am not embarrassed. No, no, no. I... You should be embarrassed. That's right. And I should be apologizing to you for your embarrassment. Well, I wasn't embarrassed either. That's a relief, for me, even though you said you couldn't hear anything. - Exactly. - So, yeah. Anyway, nice to meet you, but I'm a little hungry, so... I'm gonna go get myself a snack. Damn it. What's going on over there? I don't know. It looks like you got nominated for Homecoming King. What? Who the hell put your name on the ballot? I did. - Nice work, Tiny Flynn. - Oh, you look so cute! - Hey, pretty lady! - Hey. Oh, I'm glad you're here. A package arrived today with your name on it from Boston. What? Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh! This is so cute! Oh, I love it! Ooh, there's a card! Elle, sent you a hoodie to keep you warm for your trip to Boston. If you're up for it. Wait, what? Oh, my gosh! Oh, my God, it's a ticket to Boston! - You're gonna love it there! - Oh! So, can you make it? Ta-da! So, my answer is a firm yes! Yeah, okay. I think that's the responsible choice. Well, I guess you're right, because how else would I be able - to do all my college interviews? - Wait, you're applying to schools here? I already sent out applications to Boston University, Tufts, Boston College... And Harvard? Yes, and Harvard. - Noah, come on! - Brilliant! We're going. Shit, I'm so sorry. I forgot, I've got some karaoke today. Gotta get ready. Guys, yo, say hello to Elle. - Oh. - Hi, Elle! Hi! - Hello, boys! - Chloe, how are you? So, who's singing tonight, then? Yes? Oh, my God. Get dressed, naked boy. Scandalous! Hey, babe, I'm sorry. This is, uh... This is great news, but I gotta go, so we can talk about this tomorrow? Okay, sure... - All right, bye. - I can't wait to meet... everyone. Okay, here we go. I know I'm gonna regret this. "Chloe Winthrop." Oh, just your run-of-the-mill, breathtaking supermodel goddess. No worries there. Not sure I even wanna see this... Holy crap! That's a lot of money. Oh, boy. "The best thing to hold on to in life... is each other." It was that night I decided to hold on to Noah. - Hey, Dad. - Yeah. Could I talk to you for a second? Yeah, sure. Shoot. Um, it's just about school. I just want to know how much we, like... Figure out, what do we, like, have to... How much money we have for tuition. Yeah, um... I kinda think I need to know. You know, I... I thought you wanted to go to UC Berkeley. No, I do, I do. It's just... you know, I think it's smart to apply to some backup schools too. And some of those schools are private. Mm-hmm. You know, without some sort of financial aid and your help, I'm not so sure we can afford a more expensive college. Don't forget I still have to pay for Brad's school. Oh... I didn't think of that. - I'm sorry, Elle. You know, if I could... - Look, Dad, I totally understand. It's not a problem. Okay. This is definitely a problem. Welcome to Senior Field Day. Please report to the parking lot to pick your teams. Let's see... Okay, Ollie... All right, I am thinking we go for poundage on this one, right? Like, Tuppen would just be so... I feel you, but can you trust me on this one? Miles is phenomenal at volleyball. Student Council President Miles? Yeah. He's amazing. Let's go, Evans, come on. Who's it gonna be? - Trust me. - Let's go! Come on. Uh, we're gonna go with Miles! - Okay, Miles, you're up. - Me? Yeah, you. Whoo! Here's a team shirt, my dude. - Let's do it. - And, Marco, who's it gonna be? We'll take the big guy. Whoo! Tuppen. They've got Tuppen. Good luck, Capt. Evans. We're fine. We're good. On your marks. Get set. Elle, your shoe's untied. What? Oh, thanks. Go! Did I actually just fall for that? Oh! Go! One, two, three, toss! Unh-unh-unh! Go! Go! Go! What! Oh, my God! Pull! Marco Polo! Pull! Oh, my gosh! Whoa! - Oh! - No, focus! - Oh, ho-ho-ho! - Focus! Yeah, yeah! Oh, whoa, whoa! All right, he's good. Whoo! Let's go! Pull! Pull! Yes, yes, yes, yes! Come on, Elle! Need a hand? Oh! Hell no! Have it your way. See you at the finish line! You can do it! Come on! Oh! Hey, while we're down here, should we maybe go by that place with the thingy? Oh, my God! Of course. Rule number 21. Should we do rule number 2? - But also rule number 4. - But also, hey! Rule number 18! - Exactly! Oh, my God! Exactly! - Whoo! Hey, you know what? I think I'll head home. Really? Is everything okay? Yeah, I'm just not feeling well. Oh, okay, yeah. Bye. Feel better. Thanks. Hey, are you guys okay? Uh, yeah, I... I think so. I'd better just give her a call later. Yeah. You know, Elle, - assuming I'm the dumbest person ever. - You used to never be good at this. What's the capital of Pennsylvania? Wait a second. Is that Marco? All right, let's go. Hey, guys! Hold up! That was really good, dude. - I'm impressed. - Thanks. What'd you think, Elle? Oh, you know, my opinion doesn't really matter. I'm sure you're impressed - with yourself enough for the both of us. - Oh! Your friend doesn't like me very much. She's still upset about losing on Field Day. - Oh! - Anyways, so, is this how you spend your Fridays? Just wooing the women of Santa Monica with your fancy guitar? Any requests? - Kissing booth... - Know what? That's a shame that we have made plans. But we wouldn't wanna pull you away from your adoring fans, so we'll see you later, Marco. Don't do that to me! Come on! I'm not asking Marco to do the booth. - I don't want to. - I'm telling you. You know, give it a rest, man. I'm not doing it. No. Oh, son of a bitch! Come on. Come on, baby. Ooh! That might do it! - Yes! We still got it! - Whew! I love the smell of victory! - Oh, my goodness! - Wait! Do I smell? - No, you're good. - Cool. And there it was. A way to make a boatload of money that could help cover the cost of school in Boston. The money was real and could make things easier for Dad, no matter which school I ended up getting into. Wait, you're not actually thinking we could... Uh, win the freestyle category? That's exactly what I'm thinking. Well, actually, we are pretty good at this, aren't we? Pretty good? We've had the top score for four years. Ooh-ooh-ooh! We could even make team T-shirts. Yes! Team T-shirts! Why not? Sure! I love it! But if we're gonna do it, we have to do this right, okay? Training starts tomorrow at seven a.m. sharp. Wait. Training? "What do you want to be in five years?" Is a difficult question to answer because as soon as I start to figure out one thing, something or someone changes and makes me question everything. And if I'm not sure what I am right now, how could I possibly know what I want to be in five years? Hey, you! Hey, I'm sorry. Some of the guys were over studying. That's why I didn't call sooner. No worries. I'm glad you're making friends out there. And in two more sleeps, I get to come see you and meet all of them. Yeah, but we don't have to spend the entire weekend with them though. No, I want to get to know them. Well, one of them, at least. Five, six, seven, eight. One and two and three and four and five, six, seven, eight. And one and two and three and four - and five, six... whoa! - Ugh, sorry! God! We should take a break! Come on, I just want to get in one more hour of practice before I leave for Boston tomorrow. We only have nine weeks to get ready! Do you think that you're maybe just taking this, like, a little bit too seriously? It is serious! I didn't... I didn't want to say anything before, but... I really need the money for school. Let's do it. Oh, God! Look who's here. Ooh! This is perfect. We need a headliner for the booth. - No! - Everyone's obsessed with him! Why? You promised the hottest kissers. Like last year, you get him, everyone else will just fall in line. Ugh! - Fine. - Come on. Hey! You two do go everywhere together. Uh, yeah, yeah, we do. Anyway, uh, I... sorry. We wanted to, uh, ask you something. We do this kissing booth at the Homecoming fundraiser, and we were wondering if you'd be one of our kissers this year. No. No. Why no? - I have my reasons. - Come on, dude! It's the most popular booth! And it's for charity. Don't you believe in charity? - I'm standing here talking to you. - Hey! Whoo-hoo-hoo! That was a good... one. Okay. I'll make you a deal. I'll play you any game here for it. Holy shit! You win, I do the booth. I win, you babysit my sister for free. Let me talk with my colleague. Okay. Fine. Uh... any game. And now to set the trap. Any game except... that one. - No, no, no. I said any game. - Okay, but that one's... Well, yeah, but that one's so hard. Bingo! Okay, all right. Fine. - Your choice. - Sweet! Oh, my God! We got him right where we want him! All righty. Here you go. - Uh, hey, dude, what's your last name? - Peña. Middle name, Valentin. MVP? Oh, my God! - Yeah! Yes! Yes! - Yes! Yes! - Yes! - Oh, my gosh! Yes! Is this how you spend your Friday nights? Conning people on the DDM machine? See you at the booth, MVP! Oh, and, um... you can leave the guitar at home. Ay! Ooh-hoo-hoo! See ya! Oh, my gosh, that was crazy! - We got Marco! - You got Marco. - And we have the OMGs. - Definitely. - And you think Rachel would do it? - Oh, shit! Rachel! - What? - No, no, no! No, no, I was supposed to hang out with Rachel tonight. - I have to leave right now! Bye! - Yeah, go, go! I'm so sorry. I was practicing with Elle. Look, Lee. I know that Elle is your best friend, but this has gotta stop. - I mean, ever since Noah left... - She's always around. Exactly! You gotta say something to her. I know, and I'm sorry, but please don't blame her for this, okay? I'm the one who forgot. But it's not just tonight. She's always inviting herself or just showing up. She's lonely! I can't tell her we don't want her hanging out with us. But you can leave me standing at the movie theater for 45 minutes just fine? Listen, Lee. If you... if you can't make your best friend understand that this relationship is important, then I don't think we have a relationship. - Rachel, I can't just tell her... - Just figure out your priorities, Lee. If I'm one of them, then go and tell Elle that I am. Good night. I can't believe she got that mad about you being late one time. Well... it's a little bit more complicated than that. You okay? I'm just a little nervous about Boston. Don't worry about it. It's just Noah. Yeah. I love you. - I love you. - See you when you're back, yeah? - Yep. Bye. - Bye. But when it's been a while since you've seen someone, you do worry. You worry you've let your guard down. You worry they don't miss you. And if it's been a while, you even worry you forgot how to kiss them. You worry about everything. There's my guy. But now, I'm not worried about a damn thing. Hi! You ready for Boston? Noah Flynn, you have no idea. Whoa! I don't know. I just keep thinking about how different my life is right now. You know what I mean? And if I even think about my interviews, I feel like I'm gonna throw up. Elle, stop. You're gonna blow 'em away. Okay? Well, thank you, but we'll see about that. Um.. can I be honest real quickly? Mm-hmm. Like, later, when we leave here, I was thinking, like, if it's okay with you, I'm going to treat you like my own personal jungle gym. Check! I love this city. I love this girl. So, just before we get in there, these guys are cool, but they are a little intense. Noah, I'm fine. - Okay? - Yes! Come on! Okay, that's not what that case was at all. Oh, Citizens United was a classic example of judicial activism, right? - True. Correct. - After conservatives bellyached for years - about the liberal Supremes. - Same thing. - You are a hypocrite at its finest. - Told you they were intense! No! That was not... The only person I wanted to meet isn't here. One word and an acronym! I wonder if it was on purpose. Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys! Look who's here. Oh, James! She knows virtually everybody in here! She knows how to work a room. So I hear you got something special for us tonight? I'm excited. - Hello, hello, hello! - Hey! How are you? - You look so good! So dashing! - Nice to see you! Oh, hello, gorgeous. Mmm! - So good to see you. - You look beautiful. Thank you! - Come, join us! - Thanks for answering my call. - So, where were you? - I actually have no excuse, but I'll make it up to you tonight on the dance floor. - Oh, my God. Wait, no, is this Elle? - Yeah. I have heard so much about you. Seriously. My God, you're gorgeous. You... You're gorgeous. I love her already. Too bad this one here's so ugly, though, isn't it? - Oh! - Burn! But he does do as he's told, so I keep him around. - Oh! Oh, Noah. - I bet you do. So, where were you? So, today, total disaster. The sculptor dropped out... So, I'm in Zimbabwe, ten years old. My mom was doing a research paper on the Ndebele tribe, and we're gliding down the Zambezi River, and suddenly, we realize we're in the middle of a mother hippo and a baby hippo, and suddenly, this mouth opens up... - Get out of here! - Out of nowhere and bam! Bit off the front of the boat! So, the boat starts sinking, and everyone is swimming to the side, and my mother's like, "Chloe, Chloe, Chloe, are you okay?" I open my eyes and I'm like... - "Can we go again?" - No way! You are insane. All right! Shots! Shots, shots! You know, we actually... we need to go. No! So early? No. Elle's got college interviews tomorrow, so... Well, in that case, here's to Elle kicking ass at her interviews tomorrow. - Let's do it. - To Elle. - To Elle! - You're welcome. Hmm. Tell you whose ass I'd like to kick. Well, Miss Evans, that seems to be about it. Thank you for coming in today to meet with us. Thank you for having me. It was a pleasure. - Elle. - Yeah. Do you mind if I give you a piece of advice? I had the feeling that you were searching for the perfect answer to a lot of my questions. You should know that we're less interested in meeting the person you think we want you to be and far more interested in getting to know the person you really are. Thank you. Hello. What's going on? Is everything okay? Gotta get to the airport. Talk to me. What's up? If you wanna talk to someone, just check your phone. Elle! Elle! Life throws curves at you. You think it's moving one way, and suddenly realize it's heading back in the opposite direction. So it's difficult to know what you'll want in five years. When that curve comes flying at you and you're not sure whether you should try to hit it, catch it, or just step out of the way. Dad, I just wanted to explore my options, okay? Elle, it's not about any of that. It's about you asking yourself if you think a relationship with Noah's gonna last and if it's worth changing all of your plans for him. Do you? I'm not sure. Hey. Hey. I figured that we should talk. Why were you so upset when you left? Well, um... I guess I was looking at this whole life that you have out there without me and I'm... I'm definitely not used to seeing you around all those college girls. Elle, I told you, Chloe's just a friend. How did you know I meant her? Okay. You don't sound convinced. I wanna believe you. Well, there's no reason you shouldn't. Except one reason. If you're telling me thatnothing has happened... then I believe you. Good. You know I love you. I love you too. I'm really glad we talked. - I'll call you tomorrow, okay? - Okay. Hey. Oh, hello, handsome. I'm outside. Buzz me up? Yeah, okay. See you in a bit. - Uh... what is this? - You, my dear, have been a magnificent bore since Elle left, so I'm taking you out for some fun. I think you're good for me. Tell me something I don't know. Damn it! I'm so sorry, Elle! That's okay. All right. - I just can't get this! - Yes, you can. Yes, you can. - I know you will. - I know how much this means to you. I hate that I'm letting you down. Hey, Lee, hey! Look at me. You have literally been letting me down your entire life. Oh, man. So, how was it with Noah? I think he might be... I wanted to tell Lee everything about Noah, the earring, even my interviews, but honestly, I didn't even know where to begin. It was so fun. Yeah, we had a really good time. - Okay. - How about Rachel? How's that? Uh, pretty much the same as before you left. I'm sorry. Don't worry, though. You'll come up with something to make her come around. Yeah. Yeah, I will. Wanna practice? - Let's do it! - Okay, cool. And then drop you. When do I not drop you? - Oh, that's right. Ever. - That part where you don't drop me. Five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Oh, my God, are you okay? - Ow! - Whoa! Are you okay? - My ankle! - Let me get you some ice. Damn it! Oh! How's that feel? - Better. - Okay. Listen, Elle, I am so sorry about the competition. It's okay. Wait, actually... you know who could totally replace me? No, no, no! Yeah, yes! MVP! Come on! He's perfect! No! Don't you still need the money for school? Yeah, but... Well, he's better than me, and we both know it. With him, you could actually win. - Well, he's not gonna wanna do it. - I'll get him to do it. There's no way I'm gonna do it. Why not? I'm already doing your kissing booth, which I didn't want to do, and now this? I'm only asking 'cause of my ankle. - I can't believe she'd want me to do it. - No, she does. She knows how good you are. - And she really wants you to. - Really? Hey. Oh, hey. - So what is it? - He'll do it. - What? - He's totally on board. - What did you have to do? - Nothing! He really wanted to. Really? There you are. I'm here. Great. First of all, I just wanted to say thank you for filling in for Lee. So I thought we could start with the step patterns. Yeah, I mean, I guess we could start there. What? Well, I just thought it might be better to get the choreography down and then focus on the step accuracy. Listen, I've watched hours of these competitions, and the winners always have near-perfect footwork. But in freestyle, the step accuracy is a given. It's the choreography that wins over the judges. Yeah, exactly, which is why we're going to start with the step patterns and then go to choreography, okay? Okay. Great. If that's the way you wanna do it. Good morning, Los Angeles Country Day. Hope you all have your costumes ready - because the seniors have secured... - Hey! - A very special venue... - Where's Lee? For the Halloween gala next weekend! Our quote of the day is brought to you by William Shakesp... what the... - Give it back! Don't, Lee! - Sorry. I'm sorry. Vivian! - Give that back! - I'm sorry. Vivian, please, please! I'm sorry. I just need a second. Thank you. Hey, Rachel, it's me, Lee. Lee Flynn. Look, I'm uh... I am totally getting detention for this, but it's worth it because I really just needed to talk to you. I am so, so sorry about everything that happened, but most importantly, I wanted you to know something. I never told you this before, but... I love you, Rachel. And I'm really hoping that you love me too. So would you please text me a smiley face emoji for yes and a poop emoji for no, please? All right, Mr. Flynn. The show's over. - Ahh. - Let's go. Time for detention. - Let's go. - Okay. Come on. Let's go. Yes! Whoo-hoo! I got a smiley face! Yeah! Whoo! I got a smiley face! There's no poop! Ha ha ha! There's no poop here! Hmm. He said he'd figure out a way. Guess Lee doesn't tell me everything. Well, I'm just glad you finally said it. So, what we talked about, Elle always being around, did you speak to her? Don't worry. I took care of everything. She will be giving us plenty of space. Oh, my God, loved your speech yesterday, Lee. It was hot. Thank you. I was driven by love. And Rachel is so sweet. - And you, I'd be devastated. - So devastated! About what? You mean you haven't seen the Insta photos of Flynn's new supermodel? Bye, Lee. Sometimes there are things that get so stuck in your head, that there's only one way to get them out. Hey, I'm at the gym. Can I call you back? Um, I kinda need to talk to you now, actually. Okay. What's up? Okay. Here I go. Um... part of the reason I was so upset... when I left Boston was because I found something in your room. Okay, what'd you find? An earring, under your bed, and I wondered if it belongs to Chloe. Elle, I promise you, I have absolutely no idea how an earring got in my room. That may be so, but... it was there... Okay, I know what you thought. All right. But I'm not sleeping with Chloe, okay? I promise you. It could have been there before I moved in. It could be my roommate's ex-girlfriend's. There's countless reasons. It's just that knowing your past, it's hard not to think... That's not fair. At all. Have I ever given you reason to doubt me? No. Okay. Then I'm asking you to trust me. Please. It was heartbreaking to hear Noah talk this way, and I knew everything for us depended on what I said next. All right. I believe you. Okay. I wish you'd brought it up sooner, but... I'm glad you told me. When you're not sure where you stand, sometimes a leap of faith is the only move you can make. Okay, okay. Hang on, hang on, hang on. You're missing all the steps. How can we fix that? Okay, listen. I'm not worried about that. The precision will come. What we need is something that'll really blow the judges away. We can't even get this routine right, - and you want to make it more complicated? - I want to make it more fun! That's what the audience wants. Something like this. Holy shit! Oh! Sneaky, sneaky boy. Busted. Walking pretty well, aren't we? I'm sorry. Okay? You had a better shot with Marco, and I knew you wouldn't kick me off the team, so I did it for you. Are you mad? No. How could I be? - Oh, let's go. - Okay. Oh, shut up! I'll show you a hurt ankle. So, how is it going with Marco? - It is just fine. - Really? No. Don't even ask. Oh! By the way, so I know we were gonna go as s'mores for the Halloween dance... I think we have a winner! But I have a different idea for our Halloween costume that I wanted to run by you. Check my bag. Better than s'mores? Uh, yeah! - Right? - Oh, my gosh! - Should we do it? - Obviously! Knew you'd love it, I know you so frickin' well! - This is a winner. - I knew you'd love it. Love it! Flynn's phone. Uh, hi. Is, uh... is Noah around? I think he went to a concert. I guess he left his phone here. Oh, um... Any idea who he might have gone with? I think he went with Chloe. Oh. Uh... okay, uh, thanks. All right. Bye. Whoo! Seriously? What is the big deal? Oh, my God! The big deal is that the competition is literally in four weeks - and the routine is a complete nightmare! - I think you're exaggerating. No, listen, if you don't want to take this seriously, we should just call it off. Okay, time out. So I'm using every free hour I have, practicing into the night for this competition that you asked me to help you with, just so I could screw things up for you? No. No, I'm sorry. I'm just kinda going through some stuff right now. Look, you have to trust me. If we can't have fun, it's gonna show in our scores with the judges. I'm having fun. Sure about that? Watch yourself. I recorded us. Here. Oh, my God. You're just thinking too much. You just gotta let go, feel the music. Why did you and Lee start doing this in the first place? 'Cause it was fun. I'm sorry I've been giving you so much shit. Ah, it's okay. I'm starting to think I really need to work on my footwork. - Shut up! - Look at this! You hungry? - I'm so glad we took a break. - Yeah, for once. - I can be a little obsessive. - You put a lot of pressure on yourself. Yeah, well how else are you gonna get what you want? I don't know. I don't like making plans. I just kinda roll with things. Yeah, but... what do you wanna do? Not sure. Be happy, I guess. But I gotta say, you inspire me. Me? You know what you want, and you go after it. No. No, no. That is the wrong impression of me. I have no idea what I want to do with my life. You make things happen. I admire it. Well, I was gonna say that I... admire you for just wanting to be happy. I really am grateful for your help, by the way. I'm not exactly rich, so this is is kinda like my moonshot to pick where I wanna go to school. What do you mean? It's like something amazing that you want really badly, but it's not super likely to happen. Like winning the DDM tournament. No pressure. Hmm. "Moonshot." Feels like pressure. Actually, it is. Yeah. Tons of pressure. So... Noah's in Boston and... and I mean... I don't need to get into all the details, but there's this girl... And you think he's involved with her? I don't know. I mean... I mean, he says he's not. It's funny 'cause when he left, I kinda had just assumed that he would meet someone else and then it would just be over for us, you know? Do you think you and Noah were meant to be together? I always thought we were. But now... I don't know. It's like I'm trying so hard to hold on to this... thing, and it just feels like it's slipping away. I don't know Flynn, but if I found someone who I loved, that was smart and funny and liked the same stuff I liked, I'd never make her feel like that. Wouldn't let her get away, huh? I don't see it like that. You can't really hold on to someone. 'Cause the tighter you hold on to them, the more they wanna slip away. All you can do is love them... and make sure they know that you're never gonna slip away. Uh, I don't know if I'm saying that right. No, you're... saying it perfectly. So are you gonna go to the Halloween dance? I don't know yet. - Oh, right. Sorry, no plans. My bad. - Exactly. Expectations make it difficult to figure out what you want to be, because whether it's something you thought you'd be doing... Or someone you thought you knew. Hey. Hey, listen, I'm sorry I didn't get to call you last night. I went out, and I just left my phone at home. That's okay. Uh, did you have fun? Yeah, it was nice. We saw this pretty great band. It was great. Cool. Uh, who'd you go with? Uh, just some of the guys. Oh, um... The difference from what you expected to what actually happens... Sounds like a lot of fun. Yeah. Can make you look at the future in a very different way. Check it out! What do you think? - What? That's so unfair! - Oh! - I didn't know we were, like, doing... - Hi, Elle. Oh, hey! How's it going? Look at my stupid pumpkin, compared to his. Lee, I thought we were carving pumpkins today together. I can't even make this better. Ah, yeah, sorry. Elle and I kinda got carried away. Okay, well, I guess we can just go, then. Cool, where we all going? Uh... Hey, Lee, let's go for a walk. Okay, yeah. I'd love to. Yeah! It'll be fun! How's it going? Oh, yeah, good. Really? Yeah. Why? What do you mean? Well, I hope you don't mind me asking, but, um... What's going on with you and Miles? What do you mean? There's nothing going on! Oh! Okay, sorry. My bad. Hey, I'm sorry. No, no, I was wrong. It's none of my business. Yeah, but... you're not wrong. So you're into him? I don't know. I don't know what I am. I just... I like him. I'm not even sure why. I mean, look at him. He's like... Oof! He's a total dork, right? I don't know. He's kind of adorable. And he's really smart. And those dimples definitely don't hurt. Yeah. So what are you gonna do? Nothing, probably. Please don't say anything to anybody. I would never, no. But, Ollie, you really shouldn't care what the guys think. And you definitely shouldn't let it stop you from being with someone that you like. Believe me, I know all about that, and it sucks. Whoo! Saved the city. Boom. That's why we're here. - Whoo! - Ay-yi-yi! Oh, no! Oh, shit! - Lee, you didn't tell her? - I totally forgot! Rach, I'm so sorry, I forgot to tell you we changed our outfits! - It's fine. - Yikes! Thank you! Well, well, well. This is a little bit more than "maybe I'll show up." Ah, they called me last night to see if I could cover for lead guitar. But since we're both here... would you like to dance? Um... Yeah, that would be really nice. She has a boyfriend. - He is fine. - Well, yeah. Just let go, feel the music. I guess she got over Flynn. Um... What are we doing? We dance all the time, right? - Oh. - Yeah, no worries, I understand. I'm just gonna hop back in then. Okay. Bye! Hey. Hi. Nice costume. You too. Thanks. Um... So, I was thinking, maybe you and I could... - Whoo! Hey, dude. - Hey, dudes! - What's going on? - Uh, nothing, we're just chillin'. - Oh. - Anyway, I will see you later, Miles. - Okay. - Yeah. Let's go, boys. Yeah. See ya. Bye, guys. Oh! This is my jam! Okay! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, that was awesome. Whoo! Hey, what's up with Rachel? - She must still be upset. - Let me. Let me try. Hey. - What's going on? - I'm not in the mood, Elle. Rachel, I'm really, really sorry about the costume mix-up. I had Lee switch it at the very last... You just couldn't do as you were asked, could you? What? Rachel. I'm sorry. Rachel, I don't really know what you're talking about. - Did I do something? - Something? Did you do some thing? You crashed my prom. You ruined bowling nights. You wasted all of Lee's time with your stupid dance game. My God, Elle, with you around, I literally can't spend a moment alone with my own boyfriend! Rachel, I had no idea that you were feeling this way... How can you stand there and say that when we both know it's a lie? I'm leaving now, and I'm going to my house because that's the only way that I can spend time with Lee... - Rachel. - Without you! Rachel... And I never wanted to be a friggin' marshmallow in the first place! - What happened? - Lee, are you coming? Go, go, go. I'll find a ride... Oh, boy. Hey. Sorry, I gotta stop here. You are a good-looking couple. You look like Justin Bieber before he started being a trucker. Want some company? Sure. - Get out of here! - Hey! Agghh! I'll be right back, class. Like I said, I knew I'd come to regret this, but once you start, it's really hard to stop. That moment when your heart sinks, this is what it looked like for me. So, last rehearsal before the big day. How you feeling? Yeah, good. You sure? You seem a little off. I'm fine. Let's just rehearse, okay? Hey. Hey. Look at me. Just let go, feel the music. All right? Right. Just let go. Just let go... Just let go... I believe you. We're less interested in meeting the person you think we want you to be and far more interested in getting to know the person you really are. Let go! Okay, yeah, I think we got it. I should probably get going. Elle... your shoe's untied. I'll see you tomorrow. See you tomorrow. Moonshot. - Hello? - Hey. Is everything okay? Yeah, um, just tired. We've been rehearsing. Okay, well, I just wanted to wish you luck for your competition tomorrow. You remembered. Yeah, of course I remembered. I wish I could be there. Elle, I know that, um... That you and I have some things that we need to talk about, but I'd rather do it face-to-face. So I'm gonna be home the day after tomorrow for Thanksgiving, and I guess we can talk about it all then. Okay? Noah was right. Some things just need to be said in person. Okay. Welcome to the West Coast Dance Dance Mania ultimate showdown. There's a lot of people here, a lot of people to watch. - Sign in. - Sign in? Yeah, sign in's over there. Thank you. Look at the judges here! It's Lee. - You ready? - Whoo! Okay. - They're really good. - Yeah. Wow. Love their costumes too. Wow, they came to win. Okay, Evans, Peña. You're up next. - Thank you. - Good luck. - Let's go. - Okay. What the hell? Just have fun. - Hey, you wanna have some fun? - You sure? - Yeah. - Okay. - Let's do it. - Get ready. Oh, my God! Look! Hello! I'm Toni. I'm one of your judges tonight and a professor at the University of Southern California's Interactive Media and Video Gaming Department. It's so exciting to be a part of the event this year. This has been our fiercest competition yet. I'm proud to announce that this year's winners of the DDM West Coast Jam are... Drum roll, please. Elle Evans and Marco Peña! Anyone trying to figure out what they'll be in five years confronts one undeniable fact. Just as a great writer once said, "Perhaps the Earth was made round so that we would not see too far down the road." We set out on journeys full of hopes and expectations, but when we arrive, the destination never ends up looking exactly the way we had hoped it would. Elle, wait. Please, stop! I'm sorry, but I just can't deal with this right now. So you're just gonna ignore what's happening between us? I'm really sorry. Can we just please talk about this later? Please. Congratulations. The next day, Noah still wasn't answering my texts. And for some reason, neither was Lee. - Hey! The Evans clan arrives! - Hi! Hopefully, Thanksgiving dinner at the Flynns would take care of both problems. Wait! Rachel! Rachel, I've been trying to text you! Elle, I'm not in the mood. - I know that you're upset, but... - Seriously, Elle. Seriously, can you just talk to me? Like, I don't know what's going on. - Happy Thanksgiving, y'all. - Happy Thanksgiving, Lee! Dude, what the hell? Rachel's still so pissed at me. Yeah, well, that would make two of us. Why are you mad? Oh, I don't know. Maybe the answer is in here. Shit! Gosh, wait, Lee. Listen to me. I'm... - We're back! - Hey! - Ah, Chloe! Good to finally meet you. - Well, it's lovely to meet you too. - Yeah. Come inside. - Ooh! Wow. Oh, and Elle, you are here! Yeah, and so are you. Noah said he wasn't sure that you would be. Really? Is that what he said? Dinner's ready! Careful with those yams. You're can get drunk off those. Lee, do you wanna go talk for a second? Not really, no. Can we please just go talk? Talking. I always feel like talking's better when it's face-to-face. - Lee. - So, Chloe, I hear Boston sucks. I'm not really sure how to answer that. It's fine if that's where people want to live, but you shouldn't lie about it. Lying. Lying is an interesting topic of conversation. Of course, people aren't always making decisions alone. You know, sometimes they need convincing to do the really stupid shit. - Lee! - You need to shut your mouth. You need to leave Lee out of this. Why are you acting like I'm the one that did something wrong? Noah, you... you don't wanna go there right now. And, Lee, listen. I am actually really sorry about applying to schools in Boston, and, Rachel, I don't even know why you're mad at me right now. So you're just gonna pretend that Lee never told you that we needed space from you constantly hanging around us? What? Lee, you never... - Lee, you never said that. - Yes, he did! Lee, tell her. I tried to, but... Rach. Rach. - Oh, my... I am so... - Rach. Thank you for the invitation. I just... - Rachel. - Rachel. Rachel. Rachel. Rachel, please! She's my best friend. You lied to me! And you let me say all of those horrible things to her. I heard what you said at your birthday party when Elle ran out. Elle, what's wrong? I followed you two. I love you. But being my best friend doesn't give you the right to tell me who I can love. It's like with Rachel. What if I didn't like having her around? What would you do then? - I guess I'd break up with her. - No, you see, you shouldn't have to do that just because I didn't want you to be with her. But you don't have to break up with me because I can't be in a relationship with you and Elle anymore. It's just too much. Rachel. I am grateful for family, uh... my new friend, and... my motorcycle. Um, okay. Elle... Oh. Wow, what a tough act to follow. Let's see. I'm thankful for my family, for that I just, you know, won some money for school, and... oh, yeah, oh, my God, I am super-duper thankful that, um, that I found Chloe's earring. Oh, my God. Where did you find it? Under Noah's bed. But what I'm most thankful for is that I found the earring... before I did anything crazy, like rearrange my whole life for someone. You know, it kind of looked to me like you'd already rearranged your life. I think that maybe we should just... You know what? This has been lovely. Chloe, always a pleasure, but I think it's time for me to head out too. So... Elle. Where are you going? To fix something that's actually worth saving. And with Noah gone, I was just... lonely, you know? - I didn't realize that I was even... - Cock-blocking? Not sure if I would have phrased it like that, but, yeah, I guess. The idea that I had something to do with you guys breaking up, - I feel so... - No. Lee did this. And he'd do it again because that's how much you mean to him. Rachel, he loves you so much. And now that I know the problem, - I can absolutely fix... - Elle! It's rule number 16. You know? Rule number 16: when your bestie needs you there, you need to be there for your bestie. You know what I can't figure out though? How did your earring get under my bed in the first place? Okay, about that... Um, don't get pissy, but when you were out of town for a football game, I... sort of crashed at your place after getting into a fight with Jason and the earring must have just fallen off then. Why wouldn't you tell me that? - That's just... - I said don't get pissy. Now that we know what's happened, we can fix this. Yeah, I'm not sure if I wanna fix it. You know, I can't stop thinking about that kiss. I can't believe that she thought that I'd actually cheat on her, you know? That's the reason I was lying about us hanging out in the first place. I was trying to avoid this whole situation. Listen to me. Just to give you things from Elle's point of view, you used to have quite the reputation, right? And Elle has no idea that I am one of the few women on the planet immune to the charms of Noah Flynn. And then she finds my earring, which couldn't have been very helpful to a woman who's missing her guy all the way on the other side of the country. I don't like it when you're right. Well, I do sleep where I'm not supposed to from time to time, but overall, I'm a very talented individual. I think I know where Lee is. - Can I help you before I go? Just... - No, no, no. I'll take care of this mess. You go take care of yours. But, Elle, before you go, I just want to say this afternoon, I noticed the three of you doing a lot of talking and maybe not as much listening. I just want to tell you make sure that you really listen to what the other person has to say. Just hear them out, okay? Okay. Okay. Oh! I almost forgot. There's a thing I wanna take with me. Rule number 19. You should have told me about applying to Harvard. I know. - I'm sorry. - I thought you wanted to go to Berkeley. I do. It's just... Like, being away from Noah was so much harder than I thought it was gonna be. And you should have told me about how Rachel was feeling. I was going to, but I just... saw how lonely you were when Noah left. You know that I would have understood. Well, I guess the real reason I didn't tell you was... because I didn't want to. I just always want you around. - Lee. - But then I couldn't say no to Rachel, pretended to hurt myself so that you'd be busy practicing with Marco, and then I would have time to hang out with Rachel. Just... God! Now you know how I felt last year. I didn't want to choose either, but I had to make a choice. Hey, one more thing. Rule number 5. You did not bring it with you. Of course I did. Come on. What am I, a rookie? Rule number 5: Always do the Thanksgiving wishbone with your bestie. Okay. Here's wishing that Rachel will give me a second chance. So much for that. All right, I'm giving us 48 hours to feel sorry for ourselves. Then we have Homecoming and a kissing booth to do. Welcome to Homecoming! He's open! Go, go! Touchdown Cougars just before halftime! I see that Noah and Chloe are still here. Oh, yeah. They, um... They leave tomorrow night. All right, everyone! It's the time you've all been waiting for. And Homecoming King is... Lee Flynn! What? What? Wait! Whoa! - I won! - That's you! I won! - I gotta go down there! - Yes! Oh, my God! - I love you, man! - I never doubted you! Little bit! I don't know if I should text her still. You are the problem. You ought to be proud, let's be honest! Tell your brother congratulations. - What did you say? - I said congratulations. Is there a problem? You have no business talking to me. Wow. Someone says congratulations, and you're ready to fight him. You do have a problem. No, the only problem I have right now is you. And you didn't come over here to say congratulations, so just admit it. Okay, let's go, Noah. Noah. Noah! Let's go. Good night. Ladies and gentlemen, a reminder for tomorrow night. The LA Country Day Fiesta Fundraiser. Don't miss out on the fun. All right, everybody! The kissing booth is now open for business! All right, let's do this thing! Again! You aren't bad! Hard to believe it's been a year. It would have been my anniversary with Rachel. Do I really have to do this? Come here. You got this. Whoo-hoo! I missed you. I missed you too. I am so sorry for ever making you feel like anything less than the most important person in my life. If you give me another chance, I promise I will never... make you feel that way ever again. I love you so much. And I don't wanna lose you. You're not going to. Rule number 5: Always do the Thanksgiving wishbone with your bestie. Lee just didn't know that we both made the same wish. Everyone in this entire airport can see that you are absolutely miserable. You obviously want Elle. So, as your friend, I have to demand that you do something about it. What's the point? Look at me. Do you love her? I'm not talking to you about this in an airport. No. Stop it. Do you love her? Yeah. Then tell her, because not telling her is just stupid. And you are arrogant and stubborn and a pain in the ass, but one thing that you're not is stupid. Ollie! Ollie! Ollie! Ollie! Ollie! Ollie! Ollie! Ollie! Ollie! Come on! Stay right there! Excuse me. Are you okay? Do you have a ticket? Whoo! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Whoa! Okay. Elle! Thanks, Mia. Kissin'! Here we go! Okay. Hello. Sorry, I didn't realize I was gonna be this nervous again! Oh, my goodness! But don't worry. I've had, like, three or four breath mints, so we are... We are good to go in that department. All right. I was kinda just hoping my ticket is worth a minute of your time. Hi. I should've called you. I'm sorry. I'm sorry about the other night with Noah. It was... it was stupid. But you can't deny there's something real between us. I don't know what it is. Maybe we just got caught up in the moment or something, - 'cause I... there's... - Please... please don't... do that. We felt something. I know it. Don't be afraid of how you feel. I know how being afraid can hold you back from getting what you really want. Why do you think I joined the council? You're right. I do have feelings for you. When we kissed... there was something there. But you're not the one. I really didn't mean to hurt you. But you're not the one that I'm lying to myself about. And that's why I have to go, and I have to find him and find out what really happened. I have to hear him out... and make sure that he knows I'm not slipping away. Goodbye, Marco. Sorry! Excuse me! Sorry! Sorry! Excuse me! Noah! Oh, my God! I'm so sorry. - You look so much like my... - Elle? What are you doing here? Where's... where's Noah? He left. He went looking for you. Wait, what? Look, that earring was nothing. You've got to believe me, there is nothing going on between Noah and me. Do you know why he brought me home for Thanksgiving? He just wanted me there so that we could become friends. Oh, God. - I feel so stupid. - So does he. But he is crazy about you. You must know that. Is that him? Yeah. What did he say? He's at the kissing booth. Well, what are you waiting for? Thank you, Chloe. Good luck. Hey, I really need to talk to you. - You don't even have to say anything. - No, Elle, please. I need to say this. When I started this school year, I was pretty lonely, and I wasn't really doing so well in my classes. Why didn't you say anything? 'Cause I was embarrassed. Then I met, uh, Chloe, and she showed me around, introduced me to her friends and... And... I know we used to make fun of you and Lee and your rules, but I see what you guys have. I guess a part of me just kinda wanted to have the same thing with her. Noah. So then when you didn't believe that her and I could just be friends, it reminded me of what you used to think about me... And I didn't like that. That was... that was less about you and more just... I just compared myself to her. And when you left, I just kind of figured that we would end, so when I found the earring, I made that the thing that would end it, you know? I know, I wanted to stop you feeling jealous, so I stopped telling you things. I was so scared you were gonna get on that plane... before I could tell you that I really didn't want you to go. I thought I was leaving because of Marco. I don't care that you kissed him, but I need you to tell me... do you love him? Please try to remember what I'm about to say, okay? It's you, Noah. It's always been you. So, what do I want to be in five years? Well, to be perfectly honest, I haven't the slightest idea. Most kids my age, whether they'd admit it in a college essay or not, are still trying to figure that out. And maybe it's because it's less about what I want to be and more about who I want to be. Because I can tell you this: in five years, I want to be my brother's joy. I want to be my dad's love... And my mom's warmth. In five years, I want to be Rachel's kindness. I guess I'm next. I want to be Noah's courage... I'm telling you that I love you. And his mom's wisdom. But most of all... I wanna be my best friend's laughter. All those things together is who I wanna be in five years. And so, on this auspicious day, I leave you now with one final quote. "I love to see a young girl go out and grab the world by the lapels. Life's a bitch. You have to go out and kick ass!" Maya Angelou. All of those things is who I want to be in five years. And anything else beyond that, well, I might have to wait until I get where I'm going to figure that out. Oh, so have you heard from Berkeley yet? - Yeah. - And? Um... No, Lee first. - I got in! - Oh, my God! I have no idea. That's my boy! I knew you would! - All right, bro. - What's up? So? What about you? Um... I, uh... I... I got wait-listed. Everywhere. Berkeley and Harvard. I'm sorry, Rochelle. Thanks, babe. - Come on, bro. She's not worth it. - I'm sure one of them will pan out. No, I know. You're right. See you later. - Don't worry. - Yeah. Yes, she is. Ooh! Let's just forget about that right now. I wanna do something fun. What do you want to do? - Okay. - Get 'em! Oh, hey! You want to race? Oh, get ready to eat my dust! Whoo! Whoo! I'm far from perfect and a long way from knowing everything. But I do know enough to want to be the very best parts of the people I love best. I only hope that someday I will be. Oh, boy. Okay, remember, leave it to me this time, all right? And no jokes. Okay. You got it, boss. Ooh. - Oh, shit! - Yeah! Oh! Whoa! Can you move that pickle to my bite? You got scratches all over your face, and you're kind of blurry. Hey, wait a minute. Let's hold on so I can take the time to move a pickle. Shoot! You got it. Oh, my God. Oh, new level. Oh, damn! These are kilograms, right? Damn, girl. My neck! Whoo! Daddy! Oh, Lord! Who you've selected for this year's kissing lineup. Sorry, I up that line. God, I love her voice. Sounds like sunshine. I can see right in your shirt. I'm sorry, by the way, for being an idiot, getting my line wrong. Let's start again. - Why not? - Dude, I'm already... doing your kissing booth. Is there music? Yeah, yeah. It's me. I'm playing a slideshow. Just gettin' in my emotions part of me, everybody. My Aunt Rose was just hit by a bus. No. On a gambling trip in Germany. I have you... have mercy. Have mercy! No! Come on, Dad. Like, what the... God! You always do this when I'm in school. Shit! Okay, we'll take it from here? Are you speaking really slowly? Hello, camera. You guys sound amazing. Lucky, Marco was available, huh? Yeah, I was actually really surprised when he called yesterday to ask if he could play with us. Yeah, it's literally falling off. It's actually ridiculous. Uh, Brad. It's time for a shower, bud. But I showered two days ago. And I'm about to do the ramp jump. You have literally never made that ramp jump in your life. Hey! It's the John Travolta. No way... she's gonna give you a second chance, bae. Good luck. But in freestyle... but in... oh, my God. - But in... freestyle. - Freestyle. Today's the difference. Dude, that broke his right off. Oh, my God. It literally worked. - Hello, there. Uh, I'm Lee Flynn. - And I'm Elle Evans. - We are your hosts of... - Game On! I called that shit. This is stupid. Everything is stupid. Yearbook! I'm sorry. I'd like to take that again, 'cause I smacked an extra. So when will Marco be getting here? Marco's actually not working with us anymore. Babes, that was not... It's on your head now. What's she done? It's my line. I'm sorry. - He's, like, the most cool person ever. - Wouldn't marry me. I thought we were... shit! Hey, how come I never wear sunglasses to school? I don't know. 'Cause we drive a convertible.
