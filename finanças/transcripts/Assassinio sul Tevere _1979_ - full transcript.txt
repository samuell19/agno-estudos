I propose a toast to the president of this meeting, Manfredo, the most passionate one of this Tiber Family. We should applaud now, but having a glass in our hands, we can't. Thank you. The presidency is given to me because I am the oldest member, even if I'm much younger than most of you. We nominate as secretary Deputy Laurenzi. He'll have to work now. We need to dispel the myth that deputies don’t ever work. At 1:00 I was at lunch with the Minister. At 4:30 I had an aperitif. - At 7:00 a cocktail at the embassy. - Of course. And at this hour I still haven’t eaten. He even wanted to eat! Let’s move to the order of the day. Let’s look at the navigability issue. Or how could we make the Tiber better? The land around the shore near Portuense? You are telling me that I made this association in order to valorize my land? No, not at all! This is a no profit association. So, navigability. Let’s hear the proposals. Good evening and go in peace. Keep your hands to yourself! I am still a bachelor! Since you work at the power plant, can you do something about it? - I’ll look for a candle. - Is it out in the whole city? Yes, outside it’s dark, not even the moon is shining. Fin, you don’t have any candles? Here they get eaten by the mice. Hey, he’s dead! - He’s got stabbed in the back. - Who did it? - Why are you all looking at me? - You were closest to him. And so what? Also the deputy was close to him. Are you for real? - And so what if we were next to him? - Exactly. - It could have been anyone of us. - How tragic! We are all mixed up in this now. Why did this have to happen here! Don’t touch him, call the police, and tell his wife. - I’ll go. - No one is at his house. He phoned there before the meeting started. - You like this one? - Yeah, I like it a lot. I can show you other crosses. Come, here we have a wide selection, all handmade. The finest handcrafts from all over Italy. This was made in Florence. - How much is it? - 220.000 lira. - And this one? - 650.000 lira. I’ll take both, but I don’t have any cash. - I have traveller's cheques. - No worries. You add it up and give me the change, I don’t understand. - Of course. - Do you understand this? Marshal, with all the thieves around you always arrest me. Marshal? And him... Be careful of who gives you traveller's cheques. I have to trust my clients. And a German priest... He’s an Italian turd. I’ll leave my bike here. I’ll come back later to get it. Ok, take your time. Come here, I’ll teach you to pretend to be a priest! Are you going to arrest me? I just got out of jail. I would like to spend Christmas with my mother. - But it’s June. - Exactly. - Is this your car? - Yes. - Did you steal it? - No. I can’t pretend to be a priest with a stolen car. - Can you give me a ride? - Sure. - I’ll drive - No, I will. - No, I’ll drive. - Don’t insist... Here are the keys. Good job, Windy. I like you because you are reasonable. Now let’s take a drive and have a little chat. You like it? Why do you spit on it? - To make it shine. - Ah! - Citroen is a fantastic car. - I sacrificed a lot to get it. I'm still paying it off. Marshal, you can’t drive like this. Don’t worry, they won’t give me a ticket. Why are you going so fast? I have to find a guy named Proietti. - I don’t know him. - They call him Battery. - He makes black-outs. - I don’t understand. I’ll explain it, Proietti is a specialist. He can black-out a whole area, where can I find him? I don’t know him, I swear on my father’s grave. Oh God! - You wrecked my car! - Now you understand? Tell me where Battery is or I’ll destroy it. - I don’t know where he is. - You don’t know? Oh, God! You’d be wise to tell me where Battery is. I don’t know. No? Now we’ll find out. I don't know him, but if we stop at a coffee shop, I can call someone who knows him. You must tell me. Look out, the street is closed. Now it’s a convertible. You're asking me where Proietti is? In Trastevere. He has a print shop with his brother on Vicolo della Zanzara 22. Give me your hand. You putting me in handcuffs? This way your car won't get stolen. - I told you... - Relax. You wrecked my whole car. He destroyed my car! Son of a bitch! - Is Sergio Proietti here? - His brother is. Thank you. Hi, there. - Windy sends me. - Who’s that? I don’t know him. - You don’t know him? - No. He knows your brother! I need Battery. There’s a job tonight at a jewelry store. Here we only do printing jobs. If you need business cards, pamphlets, invitations... It’s too bad he doesn’t want to work with me. I have 2 million in cash ready to give him in advance. Two million? Wait, come here. You get upset easily? If my brother can’t do it, I have one that’s even better than him. - What area do you want to black out? - Watch out, he’s a police officer. Windy is outside handcuffed to a car. Really? - Where is Battery? - In jail for the last 20 days. He’s at Regina Coeli. So it wasn’t him. Sorry. Today we can’t go, it’s closed. My nephew and I come here every morning to get some sun. No sun today, it’s closed due to a police investigation. - We can use the tanning bed at home. - No, I want to talk to Fin... The owner is in jail. Why do you always blame the poor? Why did you arrest my father and the other five are free? Just because the shack is his? He’s not under arrest. We are just holding him as a precaution. We are holding him by orders from the District Attorney. Why aren’t you holding the others? - They are suspects as well. - Angela! - Hey beautiful! - The Marshal just arrived. Dad always said that you were his best friend. - And so? - Friend? - You are a stinker. - Calm down, little girl! When you were 2 and I was 15 sometimes I would spank you. - And so? - I can do it again. - Nico! - Your father gave me permission. - Did you talk to Fin? - And? No one can see him without permission from the magistrate. You can’t do like you did with Tozzi, I command the special unit. You have to get permission from me first. - I’ll obey. - Don’t do that ever again... Relax, I’ll ask you nicely. - Can I speak with Fin? - You were already there. Give me news about Battery. Battery is out of power, he’s in prison. So the accomplice to the Tiber assassin couldn’t have been him. Tell them that dad is innocent. He’s never done wrong and has even saved people from drowning. - I know. - You know him, have them free him. He can’t do anything. He can’t free anyone, the District Attorney gives the orders. Again with this District Attorney! - Angela, be a good girl, go home. - Why go home? - I won’t go home without my father. - You can’t stay here. - Am I bothering you? - If you stay, we can’t work. You're giving us a hard time. - Understood, I’m going. - Don’t worry. - I’m not going home alone. - Let me do it. Remember that I won’t stay home alone. I understand, she’s a little girl. - What’s wrong? - Your feet. That’s better? Listen. Why did the District Attorney have Fin arrested? He owes Ruffini a huge amount of money. We found the promissory notes. - For roughly 20 million. - Ruffini was a loan shark? Contractor and many other things, not one legal. I understand. I am sure Fin is innocent, poor guy. If he wanted to kill someone he would have done it face to face. I was raised here. When they arrested my father I slept here. Your father was a victim of persecution? - No, he was a thief. - Did they find fingerprints? No. No prints on the knife. Not even at the power plant where they messed with the breaker. The black out was done by an expert. Of course, he's the vice director of the power plant. Engineer Moretti of the Tiber Family? Ruffini got him the job because Mrs. Moretti asked him while he was fucking her. Fin told me. I’ll go see Moretti. - Where are you going? - I'll arrest him. You can’t do it without permission from the magistrate. The magistrate is Dr. Luciano Canuti, prosecutor. Without permission from the magistrate, from the prosecutor, without permission from their dead ancestors, can I piss? - Good morning. - Good morning. Where is the body from the Tiber? Which one? Today we had nine. Three are unknown, one without a head, a head without a body, but they don’t match. - Where should I put the burnt one? - Third floor, we have no room. I’m looking for the one stabbed at Fin’s. There were a lot of stabbings yesterday, a horrible day! Tell me? The remains of the one blown up on Via Adige? His aunt came and got upset. They were too few pieces. Bye. Those who died at the station? Together with those who died on the bus. There’s no room here, even the sewers are full. - Where do I find the stabbed one? - Do you want to see him? Are you a relative who came to recognize the body? No, I’m a policeman, I’m looking for Canuti. Canuti. How did he die? Knife, gun... - No, he’s alive. - I don’t do the living. Prosecutor Canuti came here for the investigation. You didn’t see him? Maybe it’s that man over there. I'm sorry that you had to see the body but these are inevitable formalities. Poor Manfredo! Gotten from the back. He didn’t deserve this, he helped all six of them! One of them is the murderer but they won’t leave the country. - We took their passport. - You should arrest them all. Only one is the murderer. I can’t jail 5 innocents for 1 criminal. Good morning, Prosecutor. Good morning, Mrs. Excuse me, I came to remind you to ask Mrs... if she heard her husband talking about some anonymous phone calls... Anonymous threats. I don’t remember, he’d never tell me anything. But he was very worried. He’d always go around with two bodyguards. Sabatucci got them. - The boxing promoter. - I know him. How can it be... The two bodyguards weren’t there that night? They were given a day off. You’ll tell me about all your suspects in my office. Now go home, I’ll have you escorted home. - I’ll do it. - Don’t worry, Marshal. With such a wife, how can someone sleep with other women? Did you know that Moretti’s wife slept with the victim? I lead this investigation, I don’t want whoever to interfere. - I’m not whoever. - Why did you come here? I want to arrest Moretti, if you let me do it. You won’t go anywhere. Poor Fin is in jail. Fuck you and whoever too. - What did you say? - I said I’ll do whatever you want. - I’m at your service. - I understood something else. You understood well. Fuck you. Did they do the autopsy on the body found in the Tiber? - What number? - What do you mean? When the bodies arrive, they are given a number. When it’s their turn, if some are gone, we don’t do it. - They’re gone? How? - They get snatched. Check, his name is Ruffini. Ruffini is the last name. There’s six of them. - Four are a mushroom family. - That is? - Poisoned by mushrooms. - Look better. Ruffini Manfredo, number 27. Tip me and I’ll pass him to number 12. Of course. Here. He’s a foreigner, we must wait for his relatives. Take him to the back, in the frozen section. Is this a morgue or a supermarket? Angela, what are you doing here? You knew I didn’t want to be home alone, I came here. I told dad too, when he got arrested. - What did he say? - That he agrees. - What do you have in that trunk? - My stuff. - Are you staying long? - Of course. I don’t have room. I’ll show you, come. Look how big is my house. It’s a hole and I only have a bed. We’ll sleep together. You’re not a little girl anymore. You have all the things that real women have. You don’t have all the things that real men have, then. Tonight we’ll find a way. But tomorrow you’re going back home. Look at her! Don’t you have a relative to go to? - I have an uncle. - Go live with him! He’s in the asylum. Instead of getting upset at me, have my dad released. - You’re a policeman. - Yes, but I’m not Superman. In order to free him, I need to know if he had any promissory note. - Promissory notes? - Of course. That’s why he was upset at someone on the phone. He called him bastard and son of a bitch. - Who was this guy? - A bastard and a son of a bitch. If all bastards were sent to jail, Rome would be traffic free. Want to eat something? Bread, salami, bologna, spaghetti, canned meat, jam, hard boiled eggs... - I have bread. What do you want? - I’m not hungry, let’s go to bed. I’m going to bed, you find a place to sleep. Excuse me if I made you come here, but I have a lot to do. Don’t worry, Detective. District attorney Canuti would like to know more about the promissory notes that your husband got from Otello Santi. From Fin? Him. Fin says that it was just a favor, and he wouldn’t get nothing out of it. He signed those promissory notes just to help your husband. - Is this true? - I can’t help you. I was never interested in these things. Excuse me. Hello? Detective Galbiati. Tomorrow at Moretti’s? The power plant by the Tiber falls? No, I forbid you. I absolutely forbid you. What? What should I do with my orders? I don’t answer you like I should only because Mrs. Ruffini is here. Tell her that she has a nice ass. Marshal Giraldi says hi. You’re wrong. You work for the electric company. - You’re an engineer. - Of course. For you it’s easy to press a button and leave the city powerless. Why should I do this and kill a friend of mine? - You’re embarrassing me. - Why? There’s a reason, your wife Silvana. She always helped me since we were engaged and students, back when I was still living in Pisa. Once she went to the dean and talked about me all night. A month later, I got my degree. - This is back when you were engaged. - Yes. - And when you were married? - A real doll! I was looking for a job for two years. But then Silvana start going to the house of this lamp manufacturer and so I got hired. You owe everything to your wife. Of course, I’d work like... Like... - Like a... - Like an ox. Indeed, private employment is a closed circle. Then my wife met Costanzi, who builds lamps and, car batteries and things... And so you found a job. In fact, as manager and CEO. I worked so much and at night I’d go home feeling a weight here. Of course! How did you end up at the electric company. Thanks to Ruffini, founder of the Tiber Family. - But I didn’t ask him. - Your wife did it for you. - How did you guess? - Just an intuition! I don’t understand why you suspect me, I worked all my life. Now I’m waiting to collect the fruits, I’ll be general manager soon. Why would I kill someone? - Is this your wife? - Cute, right? Here I am, dear. - Are you going to Rome? - Yes, I’d like the car keys. - Of course. - Thank you, honey. A kiss. - Thank you. - Bye! She's going to Rome to meet the Minister of State Owned Companies. - You’ll be hired soon. - Come with me. Yes. - Who do you think did it? - I’d check Bonardi. - The antiquarian? - That is just a cover up. Everything passes from that shop: illegal stuff, mafia... Here I say it and I deny it. I’ll go make a phone call. Here. I’m sorry. It was an accident. Why do you want to kick me out? And where should I go? - To the movies. - You’re showing a movie here. No, it’s just work. You want to work on Mrs. Ruffini and you want to kick me out. She’s coming to tell me who are the people in that footage. Can’t I tell you? I shot it and it’s my projector. - This is my house, leave. - I won’t even move. Really? I’ll take you out like a trash bin. Look what I’ll do. Come on, pretty. Come. - Good evening, Marshal. - Sit down. That’s Angela, Fin’s daughter. Yes, she’s paralyzed, I take her out to get fresh air. - I’m sorry. - Say hi. - Good evening. - Here, good. Come, sit down. I wanted you to be the first to see this. Because you are a lady. This beautiful body of yours... It can’t be beaten. I can see that you’re deeply suffering. I find you exciting. Let’s watch this footage. Yes, let’s watch it. - Who shot it? - Angela, she gave it to me. This was a month ago. It’s a day out on the Tiber that Fin planned. All the Tiber Family was there. We went all over the city. Here's Fin. This is Bonardi. And this is you, beautiful and attractive. Manfredo was happy, he cared so much for that association. - Who is this? - Amedeo Secchi. And Giovanni Tuccimei. The bodyguards. Where were they on the day of the murder? Manfredo gave them a day off, he was with friends. - Who’d hurt him? - One of his friends killed him. Also the attorney says that it was one of them. It could be deputy Laurenzi. I don’t think so, look. Or Sabatucci, the sport promoter. Here he’s taking care of the drinks. Also Nardelli, the music agent. Or Moretti, that cockold. It’s a fucking poor shot, but what can you do? I see, you always speak clearly. I don’t deny a pussy when I see one. I want to remind you that my husband died 3 days ago. Movies excite me. The movie is over and I need to go eat. I could offer you some Roman tripe. - Excuse me if I dare. - You don’t. She’d like to eat a little bit of tripe. Go to the kitchen and warm up some tripe for her. What about the sickness? If she doesn’t warm up the tripe I’ll get her even sicker. Go get the tripe! - If she your au pair? - No, I don’t need a pair of those. About the investigation, There’s nothing notable in this footage, not that I’m aware of. A policeman needs to get busy. Come on, Marshal! You drive me nuts. Get the chewing gum. - Marshal! - Let’s do mouth to mouth. Here’s the tripe! Do you want cheese on it? I’m sorry, but I don't eat tripe. See what you did? She was supposed to take the chewing gum. - Why did you get into this? - Why do you treat me like this? Because I’m in love with you since I was 12? You Iike her and you don’t even see me. You must leave I have to work! I’m not like her? I have all that she has, even better. You don’t understand, jerk! Jerk? I’ll spank you like when you were a child. You’re not a little girl anymore. I feel like biting you. Don’t phone me and don’t look for me. I’ll call you from Athens this evening. Take care, honey. Bye. What should I say if they call you? That I went on a business trip. - Have a safe trip! - Bye. - Don’t stop. - I can’t hit him. - Marshal, he’s running away. - I’ll take care of him. To the airport. You’re right he wanted to run away. When I saw his driver getting a ticket for Athens, I told you right away. - You’re good. I want to propose you for a promotion to an officer. - But I'm already an officer! - What a piece of shit! Go faster! I can’t go any faster. They are getting closer. Is it an earthquake? Filiberto, I told you not to flush the toilet. You broke everything! Who’ll pay for my fence? - Who will pay... - Shut up. - We got a flat tire. - I don’t care... My horse! Deputy! - You’re in deep shit. - Who are you? Are you a robber? A thief? - I’m a policeman. - But I’m a deputy. I know, this is why they couldn’t take your passport. - You wanted to leave. - Don’t say bullshit. I don’t have reasons to run away. - Why were you going to Greece? - It’s not your business. It is my business. You’re under arrest. Give me your passport. - Park it, please. - Did you buy a horse? No, I just borrowed it. I’ll park it. Calm down. Here, eat. He fell in the shit, I didn’t throw him in there. You abused someone who works in parliament. - You took his passport! - He was running away! No, he was going to a meeting, I checked. You think he'd come back? That’s BS. - What does it mean? - Bullshit! Go away! I don’t let you use this language! Should I write BS or bullshit? Don’t write anything! What are you doing? Our lunch? - What do you mean? - We didn’t clear things up. After what happened between us, it’s like if we are married. If you don’t come for lunch you must tell me. You and I aren’t married. Yesterday it was just a one night stand. - I can’t stand you. - Calm down! - Do you want to get married? - Yes. All right, we’ll get married then. Why the fuck did you come here? I must talk to the lawyer for dad’s bail. Then I saw you and I stopped. Does that bother you? Hello, Ma'am! - Hello, Mrs. Ruffini. - Good morning. - Did you come for the attorney? - He called me here. Did you see that Laurenzi tried to run away? Laurenzi? Yes. He has always been a friend to me. Last year he even courted me. He fell for me. I understand him. You’re the type of man who undresses a woman with his eyes. If I could undress you, I wouldn’t even leave your skin on. Mrs. Ruffini! - Good morning, Marshal. - Good morning. Come in. Are you dazed? The inconsolable widow was smiling at you. What did you have to tell her? - That is my business. - Yes. Take it! What are you doing? Son of a... - What? - That nice lady. She’s everywhere I go. Do me a favor, I must work. - Go home and bring Romoletto. - Who is he? The horse I got in the countryside. I must keep him until I find the owner. - Home? - I can’t leave him in the street. - Will he come with me? - He’s as good as a dog. Now go home. I’ll see you tonight. Give me a kiss. - Bye! - Bye. Trial against Bertarelli Franco known as Windy, accused of aggravated fraud, contempt of religion and use of stolen traveller's cheques. - I didn’t do all these things. - Silence! Tell me who’s your lawyer. I’m innocent, I didn’t do it. My mother is a widow and my father too. I asked you who’s your lawyer. I don’t have one, I don’t need one. I'll give you a public defender. Lawyer. Lawyer Veron! Can you defend the accused Bertarelli Franco also known as Windy? Don’t worry, I can help you! I’ll defend you, trust me. Let’s go on then. I’m innocent. I was dressed like a priest because I fell in a puddle and I got all wet. Nearby there was a priest costume and I wore it. And you robbed a jeweler. It’s not true, tell him, lawyer. Mr. Judge, the defendant declares guilty and asks for leniency of the Court. - What a lawyer I have! - Do you disagree? I didn't take anything, I was just talking to him. "Dressed like a foreign priest and trying to get money from him." Lawyer, what do you think? Nothing. You talk way to much! - Seen the laws... - One moment, please. Excuse me, Mr. Judge, I’m Marshal Giraldi. He arrested the defendant. Now I'm fucked! And with this lawyer... There’s been a huge misunderstanding, it’s my fault. It’s not true that Windy... Bertarelli is innocent. Those traveller's cheques weren't stolen. He was dressed like a priest because he wanted to get the discount they give to the clergy. I think he’s innocent, you can drop the charges. No objection from the prosecution. After hearing Marshal Giraldi, Franco Bertarelli, if not detained for other charges, shall be released. - No, sir. The defence objects in every way. Please Marshal, or this lawyer will get me a life sentence! How could I ever thank you for saving me? I didn't do it because you're pretty. Then why? You need to come with me to the gym where Sabatucci teaches. Why me? They won’t notice that I’m a cop. Stand straight! We must get off and get another bus. - Let's go. - Excuse me. A thief! He took my wallet! Stop the bus! I didn’t take the wallet. - Police he’s with me. - Please, Marshal. Close the doors and go directly to the police station. Marshal, we must take that bus. Marshal, can you give me the wallet now? - What wallet? - The one that I put in your pocket. Son of a bitch! It was a fantastic job. Tomorrow is mom’s birthday. Thank God we have the address, tomorrow I’ll give it back. If you give it back, what do I get out of it? You get a smack, go. Robinson, you want orange juice? I’m Windy. - Here, pay your potatoes. - He's Dumbass, an old boxer. If someone mentions Berendero, the guy who made him like this, he’ll get angry and he’ll have a lot of strength. - Hi, Windy. - Listen. This is my friend, Nico the Pirate. - He would like a job. - What can you do? I can do a bit of everything... Marshal Giraldi! Do you also train in this gym? Come here. Asshole, you should always be silent. What did I say? Can I try to fix this problem? Gargiulo, try only to go to hell. He wanted to come here. You talk to him. What do I know? We don’t have nothing to hide. - So... - I’ll go. - I'm screwed now. - Ok, bye. Listen to me, now you know who I am. I'd like to know if your boss, Sabatucci, gave two bodyguards to Ruffini and who are they. There they are, they’re two good guys. - If you need something else... - No, that's it. Thank you. Hi. Were you Ruffini's bodyguards? Yes. Sometimes, while you guys were working, you had to do something? - No, it went smoothly. Not really, Marshal. Do you mind? I would like to not say it because I’m not a rat. But one night, one week before the murder... I’d say it was about ten p.m. I was guarding the mansion garden, outside the study, how I always did when he stayed home. Then Sabatucci came and didn’t say hi to me like he always did. He seemed nervous, agitated. He entered the study where Mr. Manfredo was. Maybe they had an appointment. Sabatucci said hi to him coldly, Ruffini asked why and Sabatucci told him they had to talk about serious things. Mr. Manfredo saw me and closed the curtains. But the discussion was so loud, that I heard everything. When we bought that land, I got the building permit to build the Tiber sports center. You are building there 12 condos with swimming pools. Of course! With a sports center I wouldn’t have made any money. - Instead like this... - I don’t want to be part of this! Be careful, Manfredo, I’m warning you. If this story ends up in front of a judge, I’ll kill you. This is a bad thing, you should have said it before. There’s an innocent in prison. Yes, but Sabatucci could deny. There he is. How’s it going with that guy? Be careful, Sabatucci doesn’t play around. Neither do I. - Keep me out of this. - Calm down. Are you Marshal Giraldi, who's investigating the Tiber murder? And are you Sabatucci, my suspect? Are you here to investigate? To ask questions? Don't waste your time, I already said everything I knew. Did you say something about the Tiber sports center? About the condos, about the swimming pools? Don’t worry and be happy, as long as you can. Dumbass! - Would you like a fresh oj? - No. - Do you know that guy? - No. - It’s Berendero. - Berendero? Do you remember him? Go! - How many cards? - I want one. Good evening. The shop is closed. - I know. - Who are you? I’m Marshal Nico Giraldi, born in Tor Marancia the third of March 1945. You’re Nico, Scratchy's son. - You knew my father? - Scratchy? They talked about him also in South America, he was a good thief, who died on duty. - He died trying to save a friend. - That friend is me. - You’re Frascatano. - Yeah! You owe my father 5.000 lira for 20 years now. I read it in his diary, I'll take it. What do you need? I would like to know... Who's the antique dealer. I think it's him. Yes, but I have nothing to say. I already spoke to Canuti with my lawyer. What do you want to know? I would like some information to save an innocent man from prison, but Bonardi should tell me. - I can’t help you. Ruffini’s death hit me hard as well. We had business together. - How many cards? - I'm good. - I’m fine. - I understand, good evening. One card. - Bastards! - You’re wrong. We don’t know those 3 dumbasses. - That isn’t our stuff. - I think they’re from Calabria. But he's strong. 3 vs 1 and they couldn’t do it. A worthy son for his father. Look what you did to your outfit. They were 3. You can’t get yourself killed before you get married. After I marry you, can I get killed? - Don't even say it. - Good. The horse has to go. I don’t want it in my house, take it back to where it came from. I don’t remember. I put an add in the newspaper for his master to come get it. I can't be your maid and its stable hand. It’s good, it also got attached. - Aren’t you ashamed? - It wasn’t me, it was Romoletto. It wants to go out. Let’s go, I’ll take to shit. Hello? Good, Sabatucci! I’m feeling fine. You instead? You should ask me about those 3 guys you sent me yesterday. I didn’t send you anyone. I don’t do these things. Yes, I read it today in the newspaper. I admire you even more. I admire who pays in person. Come in an hour to the Urbe airport I’ll tell you something really important, so important you’ll be able to arrest the murderer. No, things didn’t go as you say. You’re denying that a week before the murder you threatened Ruffini? I didn’t have you come here for a confession. It’s the opposite. You have to know that that night I went to Ruffini’s mansion, but I didn’t argue with him, he was arguing with another person that was already there. You let me come here at this hour, for a similar proposal? I still didn’t say to you that it’s about 1 billion. Who guarantees that I’ll get the building permit? - I can guarantee for it. - Giuliano is here. We already talked. You know that with his systems you can obtain everything. It’s a big business. 40% for you, 40% for me and 20% for Bonardi. Only 20% for me? Why? No, equal partners. You already screwed me once with that fake Caravaggio. But the thing isn’t finished, I sold it in Switzerland. But if this business goes bad, remember, it will be even worse for you. That Caravaggio was fake. You make your conclusions. I didn’t accept Ruffini’s offer. I don’t like sloppy offers. Why didn’t you say something so important? One can repent about talking, but never about being silent. I was there when Bonardi’s was threatened and when you heard about that meeting I had with Ruffini, I wanted to clear things up for me. I understand, can you testify about the things you said? Of course, as soon I come back from Florence. - I’ll wait for you in my office. - Ok. Marshal Giraldi, despite my absolute prohibition, you conducted a private investigation that damaged our work. But what did I damage? Sabatucci told me about Bonardi, the antique dealer. You should have said something instead of going to the airport. We'd have prevented Sabatucci from exploding in his plane. The prosecutor is right. Was it me who put the explosive in Sabatucci's asshole? Get out! - When will you let Fin out? - He’s a suspect. He's officially been charged. You think hi was him! He was heard threatening Ruffini during their meeting. - Is it enough? - There's a witness. - Who? - You’ll know when it’s time. - I don't want to ruin the evidence. - So listen. Who tried to kill me at the power plant? Who sent those three with the knifes? Who put the bomb on Sabatucci? Fin who’s in jail? One can have accomplices and you have one in your house. My Angela? - Son of a bitch... - Calm down! - You are making it all up? - You're suspended. Out! Suspended? I'm suspended... This is BS. - What? - Bullshit! What do I have to write? I won't write anything. You swim really good! - Can you pass me the robe? - Now. Here’s the robe. Did you get my phone call? Thanks for coming. I need to talk to you in private. I like delicate things. You're losing your belt. Aren't you afraid of living alone? You fired the bodyguards. After what happened, it’s dangerous. The assassin could kill you too. I’ve been kicked out of the police. I could be your bodyguard. You think that I need one? I think so, with such a body like yours... Now there are too many deaths. Your husband, Sabatucci, the antique dealer... Bonardi? Two hours ago I went to his shop and found him hanged. It wasn’t a good thing to see. - Want a banana? - No. - A piece? The top? - No. Excuse me. I want to know why you called me here, if it's to continue what we were doing when we got interrupted. I have suspects in mind, but I didn't want to talk about it before for not ruining the memory of my husband. Your husband was a big son of a bitch. Unfortunately it's about drugs. My husband traded it with Nardelli. He threatened him. I’ll tell you the truth, Sabatucci lied to you. I was in the studio that night. I saw and heard everything. Bonardi wasn’t there and my husband invited Sabatucci to talk about building a sports center. Then arrived Nardelli, shocked. Manfredo! - Enzo, what’s happening? - You don’t know? - You play dumb? - Do you mind, dear? My husband begged me to go away and I did. But I was scared by Nardelli's behavior so I stood there and listened. Your butler told me that you weren't home. Relax or I’ll report you for trespassing. - I’m leaving. - No, stay. You have to hear what I say to this idiot! - You are an idiot! - Sure? I’m tired of your dirty games! They were fine as long as I was making you money. Watch what you say or I’ll kill you! - Asshole! - Stop! Unfortunately, my husband was partners with Nardelli, who brought drugs into Italy and made money off of festivals that he organized. In the Tiber Family, the cleanest one had rabies! And for this, that evening I didn’t leave the house. It’s exactly how I imagined. Like if I thought of a fight, a rumble... What happened? Excuse me a moment. - Let go of me! - You can’t! - Nico! I have to tell you something. - Why are you yelling? Did I interrupt your love affair? I’ll throw you both in the pool. Let me work, she’s rich, she could give me a job here. - Go home. - No, wait. - Dad escaped from prison. - That’s not possible. He called an hour ago. He’s hiding in a boat near Scafa. He said he wants to kill himself and everyone else. A massacre! If you come close, I’ll kill you! Fin, don’t shoot, it’s Nico! - You don't recognize me? - Yes, that’s why I’ll shoot you. You are a policeman and you came to arrest me. Don’t shoot! - Fuck you! - Dad, I'm here too! - Don’t kill him, he’ll marry me! - Did you hear? Fin, you're so stubborn. Why did you do something so crazy? - What? - You ruined yourself. I don’t care! - I won't go to jail, I’m innocent. - He’s right. The night of the meeting you threatened to kill Ruffini? - What are you saying? - The police have a witness. - They heard you threaten him. - It’s true, I called him. - What did you talk about? - About those payments... - That's too bad. - I was mad as a cow. You're a jerk, a coward. You cashed three payments without telling me. 20 million! Where can I get that? I would also have to sell my daughter to repay you. When you come here this evening I will kill you. Tell me the truth, did you kill him? - Fuck you! - Just give me your word. Those are things one says in a fit of rage. Then I calmed down because he told me that he got them back and that he tried to cash them because he was in financial trouble. He called home but his wife wasn’t there. When you made that call, was it possible that someone heard you? - No. - Think hard. I was alone on the... But now that I think about it... - Hi, Nardelli. - Hi. You are already here! I came early to get a seat next to the president. Ok, let’s go. It’s clear, he heard me, he was there for a few minutes. That’s who Canuti’s super witness is. No, the super trickster. - What are you saying? - I know what I am saying. He wanted to sit near the president... The widow was right to accuse him. - You believe it was him? - Yes. But I need proof. And now I’m suspended from the police, that's too bad! But Nardelli doesn’t know me so maybe I can trap him. - Someone is coming. - Who is it? The police! Relax. Fin, come out, be a good boy. And you too, Nico, we know you are there too. We followed you. Don’t be stupid! Don’t shoot, let them arrest you, I’m going for a swim. - Where are you going? - A kiss. Why are you leaving? Careful, they’ll shoot you. This is "muy bien", but I don't have money. - I only have traveller's cheques. - Don’t worry... What’s are you doing? It’s a Paraguayan priest! No, he's a smart ass! - Let me work. - Let’s go. How absurd! You can’t trust anyone. I must find you a song and a women's trio? I know three faggots who sing at Finocchio. It's a club at Testaccio, I could tell them. Now, let’s continue to present the contestants of the 7th annual rock festival... Good evening. The tape? - No, I’ll worry about my client. - Ok. Do you need headphones? Now a new singer, but it's amazing! I heard him at rehearsal and I was shocked, amazed! It will also happen to you. Here he is, for the first time in Rome, Nico Doppio Zero and the Ricotta sisters! Everyone can I have your attention. With Nico Doppio Zero’s exhibition, we have concluded the list of participants of this festival organized by Enzo Nardelli! Not bad that singer, he sings like... - Rocky Roberts. It’s true? - Yes and so... He told me that he wants to talk to you. He wants to sign with our record label. - Have him come to my office. - Ok. I thought you wanted to talk to me about a record deal. I don’t care about singing. Who lives singing dies whistling. But you were so good. You made the finals, you could win the contest. Today they applaud you, tomorrow they piss on your head. So what do you want? - Can I talk? - I’m listening. I want to make a lot without working a lot. How can I? - So, how can I? - With the stuff. - What stuff? - Come on, you know. Drugs. Drugs? Are you crazy! What are you telling me these things? Hey, you! You are organizing a music festival in the Orient. We are going to Turkey ... And why are we going to Turkey? To sing to the Turks? In my equipment we can hide 10 kilos. - Let’s go 50-50.. - I’m not interested. You can trust me, I’m not like Ruffini. You were partners, but he screwed you. That’s enough, I’m tired of these games. I’m not kicking you out only because you made the finals. Why are you upset? I offer you a deal and you treat me like this? Get out! Go get ready. See you in Turkey. Here we are at the final of the 7th annual rock festival! The three contestants of the finals are Alex, Viviana and Nico Doppio Zero! Let’s start the grand final with Nico Doppio Zero. Here he is, Nico Doppio Zero! An applause for Nico Doppio Zero! Where is he? He’s not here, you can only hear his voice. Guys, it’s a scam! They tricked us. That's just a tape. Let’s get our money back, they want to trick us. To the rescue! What happened? Where is Nico? - Angela let me go on. - No! I don’t want a clown for a husband. I’m tired! Now you even have fans that drool all over you! - I have to go sing! - What are you saying? - Don’t even think about it! - Oh, God! You fight and I get slapped. How dare you? - Go home! - Fuck you! Calm down! There was a technical issue. Calm down, please! Please, be patient! How good! Now you really hit the bottom. You even got arrested. What were you trying to do? I wanted to sing! One can’t even sing now? You were pretending to sing using the registered voice of a real singer. If that bitch Angela didn’t come, I would have won too. And you made a mess. But why? - What was I trying to do? - What? Free the innocent and have the criminal arrested. And you made a fool out of yourself for that? Look at that... To make a full out of yourself you need to have a big heart, and even bigger balls! I could bring you here Nardelli. - I’d take him here and go. - Why are you sure he’s guilty? The night of the reunion of the Tiber Family... This is the table. The dead was sitting here when he was alive. He arrived early to sit here in order to kill him during the black-out. Fin was sitting here, he’d take half an hour to come and one to come back. - Yes. But Finn threatened Ruffini two hours before the murder. He was upset about the promissory notes and said things. What are you talking about? When he got the promissory notes back they made peace. Then he phoned his house and... Dick head! - What? - Dick head! - Are you upset at me? - No, I’m upset at myself. Angela, come. Come! Sit next to me, look. What’s that? Look, I’ll do it again. Look. I’ll show you again... Now come, focus. Look at the foot of Mrs. Ruffini. I’ll show you again, pay attention. I understand everything. Damn! You put your tongue in my mouth! - I’ll marry you, if you want. - Fuck you, faggot! Let’s go. My love! Honey, it’s me! My love! I didn’t hear you come in. The water was running. - I’ll go get changed. - So soon? Wait. Bad kids! Marshal! I thought she wore a bra, but they stay up on their own. What do you want? Calm down. Calm down, Amedeo Secchi. Remember how I took care of those three with the knife. Don’t you bother me. I don’t know what are you saying. Leave or I'll call the police. I’m a policeman. There’s no problem. I’m just sorry that I ruined your fuck. I could give you 10 minutes, because if they don’t give you life, they’ll give you 30 or 40 years. When your boyfriend gets out of jail, his snail will have retired. We have no problem in admitting our relationship. Ruffini was a horrible man and you know it. - He deserved that I cheated on him. - Yes, he deserved it. He was a cockold and glad about it... But I was wrong. I was wrong when I saw the footage of your trip on the Tiber. I should have seen that you were playing footsies. I would have saved myself a lot of trouble. Is it forbidden to cheat on your husband? Of course not! But it’s too much to cheat on your husband, kill your husband, and take your husband’s money plus the insurance money. It’s almost a billion. Do you have evidence? You gave me the evidence. The other day you told me that night you didn’t go out. But that night your husband phoned you and you weren’t home. Where were you? I’ll tell you now. You were in your lover's car, Amedeo Secchi, who took you to the Tiber banks 300, 400 meters north of Fin's place on the opposite side. Hugging like two lovers looking for a quite place, you arrived to the stairs and you Mrs. Eleonora took off your raincoat disclosing a diving vest underneath and went down to the Tiber. At that time, around 09:30, no one could see you with that black thing on. You wore your rubber gloves and dove into the water ready to swim across the river. You swim well. I saw you. In the meantime Amedeo went to the power plant where he got ready to black-out the whole neighborhood. It was easy for him because, before becoming a boxer and a bodyguard, he was an electrician for 5 years, as the police records state. The swimmer, helped by the current, had finished crossing and had arrived to Fin's place. She climbed unseen up the ladder to the back of the warehouse that is attached with a walkway that goes to the dressing room. I know Finn's property, I use to go there when I was a child. I know the locker room where she hid that open on one side to the terrace and on the other side to the meeting room. I'd have thought about it before. Mrs. Eleonora in the closet and Mister Amedeo in the power plant were ready. At the agreed time of 10:30, Amedeo flipped the switch causing the black-out. As soon as it was dark, she got out of the closet and killed her husband. The poor man didn't even have time to scream. Nobody saw anything. Eleonora went back to the closet and left from the outside door. She walked back where she came from and down the ladder to dive back in the Tiber always swimming favoring the current. She had enough time. To get the power back on it would take half an hour. She went back to the river bank where her friend was waiting for her and then he took her back home to get the sad news. Not bad! You're better than a detective show! You're making a detective show! You don't have proof. I'm not done. You blew up Sabatucci's plane thinking that he may accuse you. Actually he wanted to accuse Bonardi. - You had Bonardi hung. - Really? Now you accuse me of killing Bonardi because he sold me a fake Caravaggio? You're so nice! I think that your brain is fake! You had Bonardi killed just because he knew what you did and he was blackmailing you. - You're crazy. - Listen... Tell your man that he can talk only when the chickens piss. That's too much. No, I'm tired of you. We are talking too much, let's go. Amedeo, careful! My love! Hello? - Hello, Galbiati? - It's me. It's Nico, the case is solved. Bring a big silver plate, we have two chickens to roast. It's Giraldi, he got the two murderers. - The case is solved. - Congratulate him. Well done, Nico, Mr. Canuti congratulates you. Tell him what he can do with it. He kindly thanks you. Cheers to the new couple! - Hurray! - Cheers the new couple! - Cheers! - Congratulations! Cheers to the new couple! My wife couldn't come, she had a lunch with the Minister. I wish you a marriage as happy as mine. Let's hope not! Congratulations. Let's take a picture. Don't move. - Smile! - One when we kiss. A kiss, good. Look who's here. Romoletto came to see us. - Cheers to the new couple! - Cheers! Cheers! Cheers to the new couple! - Bye! - Goodbye!
