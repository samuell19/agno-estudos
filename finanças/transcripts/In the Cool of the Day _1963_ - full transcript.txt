SAM LIKES TO KNOW WHEN GUESTS ARRIVE. THANK YOU. HA HA! THERE YOU ARE. THIS IS GREAT, REALLY GREAT. LET ME GET A GOOD LOOK AT THE NEW BOARD MEMBER. I'M AFRAID HE HASN'T CHANGED MUCH. HOW ARE YOU? I COULDN'T BE BETTER. I'VE REALLY BEEN LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS, FELLA. SO HAVE I. WE DON'T SEE EACH OTHER OFTEN ENOUGH. WELL, GIVE ME YOUR THINGS. ARE THESE ALL BESTSELLERS YOU'VE DUG UP? HA HA HA! THEY BETTER BE. WE'LL GO OVER THEM AFTER LUNCH. WHAT A BEAUTIFUL HOUSE. YEAH. IT USED TO BE THE OLD MAN'S. CHRISTINE AND I HAVEN'T DONE MUCH WITH IT. Woman: MR. SAM, I HEARD THE CAR, AND I WONDERED IF YOU WANTED-- OH, EXCUSE ME. MAGGIE, THIS IS MR. LOGAN. HOW DO YOU DO? HOW DO YOU DO? YOU GO ON INTO THE LIVING ROOM, FELLA. I'LL BE WITH YOU IN JUST A SECOND. NOW, WHAT'S THE TROUBLE, MAGGIE? I WONDERED WHAT TIME YOU'D WANT LUNCH. Sam: WE'LL HAVE LUNCH IN JUST A FEW MINUTES. YES. Sam: I'M ATTACHED TO THAT DRAWING. IT WAS MADE 6 YEARS AGO, JUST BEFORE WE WERE MARRIED. SO I KEEP TELLING MYSELF. WELL, HERE, YOU MUST BE FAMISHED. COME ON. WE'LL TAKE THESE INTO THE OTHER ROOM. WHEN'S THE FIRST MEETING? TUESDAY AT 10:00. THAT WILL GIVE ME TOMORROW TO SHOW YOU NEW YORK AND HAVE YOU MEET THE OTHER MEN AT THE OFFICE. I GATHER FROM CHARLES' MEMO THAT YOU--YOU'VE GOT A LOT TO SAY. I'M AFRAID I HAVE. YOU CAN JUST LEAVE THAT THERE, MAGGIE. SHE THINKS I DRINK TOO MUCH. WELL, WOULDN'T YOU, IF YOUR FATHER HAD A BAD CORONARY AND YOUR WIFE HAD WALKED OUT ON YOU? IF SHE DOESN'T COME BACK, I DON'T SEE HOW I'M GOING TO STAND IT. I JUST DON'T SEE HOW. CHRISTINE'S NOT STRONG. SHE NEVER HAS BEEN. MAYBE THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS ABOUT HER THAT MAKES ME LOVE HER THE WAY I DO. ON OUR HONEYMOON, ON THE WAY TO GREECE, YOU REMEMBER, SHE CAME DOWN WITH PNEUMONIA. FOR 3 WEEKS, I DIDN'T LEAVE HER SIDE. WHEN I WASN'T WITH HER, I WASN'T WHOLE. I WASN'T ANYBODY. IT'S STILL LIKE THAT WITH ME. AT TIMES, FOR BRIEF MOMENTS, I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE LIKE THAT WITH HER, BUT MOST OF THE TIME, SHE'S MILES AWAY FROM ME. THAT'S THE WAY IT'S BEEN THESE LAST MONTHS. SHE'S MOVED FURTHER AND FURTHER AWAY. UNTIL ABOUT 6 WEEKS AGO, SHE SEEMED TO COME TO THE END-- TO THE EDGE OF SOMETHING TERRIBLE, LIKE AN ANIMAL IN A TRAP. WELL, FINALLY, WHAT COULD I DO BUT LET HER GO? SHE HAS AN OLDER SISTER WHO'S LIVING IN MEXICO. SHE'S WRITTEN TO SAY SHE'S ALL RIGHT. THAT'S ALL. ISN'T THERE ANYBODY ELSE WHO COULD HELP? PARENTS? HER FATHER'S DEAD. NEITHER OF US WOULD ASK HER MOTHER FOR THE TIME OF DAY. BOY, IS THAT WOMAN'S FALLOUT LETHAL. MURRAY, IF YOU KNEW HOW GRATEFUL I AM THAT YOU'RE HERE... HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH THIS KIND OF PAIN? HOW THE HECK DO YOU LEARN TO DEAL WITH IT? I DON'T KNOW, SAM. PERHAPS YOU PULL BACK FROM WHERE IT HURTS MOST. TRY TO CONCENTRATE ON SOMETHING ELSE--ON WORK... WHATEVER COMES ALONG. THIS LIST OF OURS, YOU KNOW-- ...HASN'T DONE BADLY FOR US OVER THE YEARS. OVER THE YEARS IS RIGHT. I'M GLAD SOMEBODY FINALLY SAID IT. YES, BUT OUR WRITERS ARE GETTING OLD, SAM. THE WORLD IS CHANGING. WE TOOK A RISK WITH BELOW THE ANGEL. WE DIDN'T. YOU FORCED IT ON US. TELL HIM I'M ON MY WAY. I'M SEEING AUSTIN AT THE OAK ROOM. WE'LL MEET TOMORROW AT 10:00 AND FINISH UP. WALTER, READ THAT. SAM'S NOT SURE. I'M NOT SURE IT'S FOR THE AMERICAN MARKET. READ IT. OK. SEE YOU ALL AT JIM'S LATER. YOU GOING TO VISIT DAD? YES. TELL HIM I'LL PHONE HIM. I PROMISED MY WIFE I'D BE HOME BEFORE THE BRAWL. CAN I DROP YOU AT FREDERICK'S? IS IT OUT OF YOUR WAY? AS A MATTER OF FACT, IT IS. MR. BONNER'S IN THE LIBRARY, SIR, AT THE HEAD OF THE STAIRS. MR. LOGAN? YES. MR. BONNER'S EXPECTING YOU, BUT YOU MUSTN'T STAY LONG. Man: COME IN. HELLO, SIR. COME IN, MURRAY. IT'S KIND OF YOU TO COME AND SEE ME, BUSY MAN LIKE YOU. I'M SORRY I'M LATE, BUT THE MEETING WENT ON LONGER THAN WE EXPECTED. THEY ALWAYS DO. OH, PLEASE, DON'T GET UP. NO, I MUSTN'T AT THAT. WELL, IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU LOOKING SO WELL. DO SIT DOWN, MURRAY. WOULD YOU LIKE SOME HOT TEA, OR WOULD YOU PREFER A DRINK OF WHISKEY? NO, THANK YOU. THE WAY THINGS LOOK, I'M AFRAID I WON'T GET TO LONDON THIS SPRING. I'M SORRY TO HEAR THAT, SIR. FIRST TIME IN 40 YEARS. THIS YEAR I THOUGHT I'D TRY ONE OF THOSE MEDITERRANEAN CRUISES. I'VE BEEN READING THAT MAN DURRELL. HAVE YOU EVER BEEN TO THE MIDDLE EAST? WELL, I WAS IN EGYPT IN '42. EXCEPT FOR THAT, I'VE NEVER BEEN FURTHER THAN GREECE. I LIVED THERE FOR ABOUT TWO YEARS. MURRAY, UH, I WANT YOU TO MEET MY DAUGHTER-IN-LAW. CHRISTINE, THIS IS MURRAY LOGAN. HOW DO YOU DO, MR. LOGAN? HOW DO YOU DO? SAM HAS SPOKEN OF YOU SO OFTEN. MURRAY WAS VERY HELPFUL WHEN SAM WAS IN THE LONDON OFFICE. YES, I KNOW. SAM STILL TALKS ABOUT IT. WHEN DID YOU LIVE IN GREECE? OH, A LONG TIME AGO. I WAS A PRESS OFFICER FOR THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT, AND I DECIDED TO STAY THERE. THEN YOU MUST HAVE REALLY SEEN THE COUNTRY. AS MUCH AS I COULD. DID IT LIVE UP TO YOUR EXPECTATIONS? IT MADE NONSENSE OF MY IMAGININGS. IT WAS BETTER THAN ANYTHING I COULD HAVE IMAGINED. Mr. Bonner: WE ALL HAVE OUR PASSIONS, AND CHRISTINE'S IS FOR GREECE. I'M TERRIBLY SORRY. I'M SURE YOU TWO WANT TO TALK SHOP. DON'T YOU DARE. NO ONE'S ALLOWED TO TALK SHOP WITH ME TILL NEXT WEEK. I HEAR THE HANCOCKS ARE GIVING YOU ONE OF THEIR PARTIES TONIGHT. YES. IT'S VERY KIND OF THEM. Mr. Bonner: UH-HUH. YOU KNOW, I CAN REMEMBER THE DAYS WHEN PUBLISHING USED TO BE DONE BY PROFESSIONALS. NOWADAYS, YOU CAN'T TELL WHETHER A MAN'S A POET OR A SOAP SALESMAN. IT'S MOST UPSETTING, AND IT'S VERY CONFUSING. Christine: MR. LOGAN? Mr. Bonner: GO AHEAD. SHE'LL GIVE YOU NO PEACE UNTIL YOU DO. YES? IS THIS THE WAY IT REALLY LOOKS? IF ANY PICTURE COULD DO IT JUSTICE. LET'S SEE. UH! THAT'S DELPHI. I WONDER IF THEY HAVE A DRAWING OF THE OLIVE GROVES. THEY GO RIGHT DOWN TO THE GULF. YOU KNOW, IN CERTAIN LIGHT, YOU CAN'T SEE WHERE THE TREES END AND THE WATER BEGINS. THESE ARE THE ISLANDS. THIS IS MYKONOS. I THINK IT'S THE MOST BEAUTIFUL PLACE I'VE EVER SEEN. [DOOR OPENS] [FOOTSTEPS] I MUST BE GOING. NOT YET, MY DEAR. I'VE STAYED LONGER THAN MISS SHAW SAID I COULD. Miss Shaw: NOW, MR. BONNER, YOU KNOW WHAT DR. WHITEMAN SAID ABOUT VISITORS. I SHOULD BE ON MY WAY, TOO. BOTH OF YOU? IT'S TIME, SIR. Mr. Bonner: YES, I SUPPOSE IT IS. MURRAY WILL TAKE YOU WHEREVER YOU WANT TO GO. I CAN TAKE MYSELF. I'VE OFTEN WONDERED WHAT IT'S LIKE TO SEE NEW YORK FOR THE FIRST TIME. ARE YOU ENJOYING IT, MR. LOGAN? VERY MUCH. THE PART I LIKED BEST WAS MY VISIT TO RUNNYBROOK ON SUNDAY. HUH. I DIDN'T REALIZE YOU'D BEEN THERE. WON'T YOU AT LEAST TELL ME WHERE YOU'RE STAYING? YOU'LL TELL SAM. PLEASE TRY TO UNDERSTAND, FREDERICK. GOOD-BYE, SIR. GOOD-BYE, MY BOY. DROP BY AGAIN, IF YOU CAN. I'M AFRAID I'M LEAVING FOR LONDON TOMORROW. WELL, NEXT TIME YOU'RE IN THE STATES. YOU'LL BE COMING OVER OFTEN NOW. I HOPE SO. BYE. BYE. YOU WANTED TO SEE HOW I'D TAKE IT. THAT'S WHY YOU SPOKE ABOUT RUNNYBROOK. SAM TALKED TO YOU, DIDN'T HE? YES, HE DID. [SIGH] I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW SORRY I AM. I KNOW WHAT THIS MUST BE DOING TO SAM, AND I--I DON'T WANT TO HURT HIM. ALL HE WANTS IS TO HAVE YOU BACK. IT'S AS SIMPLE AS THAT. IS IT? I WISH I COULD MAKE YOU SEE. I WISH I COULD MAKE SOMEONE SEE. WHAT ABOUT FREDERICK? FREDERICK'S THE LAST PERSON I CAN TALK TO. SAM'S HIS SON. AND I'M SAM'S FRIEND. ANYWAY, I HAVEN'T MADE SUCH A SUCCESS OF MY LIFE THAT I'M QUALIFIED TO HELP ANYBODY ELSE. I'LL TAKE THAT CHANCE. I HAVE TO. WILL YOU TELL SAM WHAT I'VE TOLD YOU-- THAT HE'S DRIVEN ME AWAY WITH HIS NEVER-ENDING GOODNESS AND CARE? WELL, ISN'T IT POSSIBLE FOR YOU TO TELL HIM THIS YOURSELF? DON'T YOU THINK I'VE TRIED? OH, I KNOW THIS SOUNDS DREADFUL. SOMETIMES I THINK SAM LOVES ME BETTER ILL THAN WELL. EVERY EFFORT I MAKE TO LEAD A NORMAL LIFE TEARS HIM TO PIECES. IF YOU DID LEAVE FOR GOOD, WHAT WOULD YOU DO? I DON'T KNOW. I'D LEAD MY OWN LIFE. IT MIGHT BE SHORT, BUT IT WOULD BE A LIFE. YOU SEE... MY--MY MOTHER ALWAYS TOLD ME I WAS INCAPABLE OF LOVE. I DON'T BELIEVE THAT! MAYBE I MARRIED SAM TO GET AWAY FROM THE KIND OF LIFE I HAD WITH HER, BUT I WAS READY TO GIVE HIM EVERYTHING I HAD, TO BE A GOOD WIFE IN EVERY WAY. AND IF I GO BACK, I'LL DO EVERYTHING I CAN TO MAKE HIM HAPPY, BUT FOR BOTH OUR SAKES, IT HAS TO BE ON MY TERMS-- AS HIS WIFE, NOT HIS CHILD. YOU'LL BE LATE TO YOUR PARTY. GENE! GENE! I WANT YOU TO MEET MURRAY LOGAN OF OUR LONDON OFFICE. YES, COME ON, DARLING. I HAVE SOMEBODY ELSE I WANT YOU TO MEET. OH, HERE ARE THE AVERYS, DEAR. UH, MURRAY LOGAN, OUR LONDON OFFICE... THE AVERYS. WELL, HELLO! SAY, I HAD A LETTER FROM CYRIL LAST WEEK-- YES, WELL, HE'S DYING OF THIRST, SWEETHEART. I JUST HAVE TO GET HIM A DRINK. LISTEN, WHY DON'T YOU LET ME GIVE YOU A PARTY? SAM! Woman: YOU'LL GET A BIG BANG OUT OF ONE OF MY PARTIES. SAM. I BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU, FELLA. I JUST SPOKE TO DAD. HE SAID THAT SHE WAS THERE TODAY, THAT YOU MET HER. YES, I DID. WELL, FOR GOD'S SAKE, TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED. WELL, I MET WITH YOUR FATHER. THEN SHE DROVE ME THROUGH THE PARK. SHE WHAT? BUT SHE ISN'T SUPPOSED TO DRIVE IN TOWN. THE LAST TIME SHE PULLED A STUNT LIKE THAT, SHE COLLAPSED. WHY DIDN'T YOU STOP HER? WHY DIDN'T YOU? IS THERE SOMEWHERE WE CAN TALK? UH...COME ON. JUST DON'T ASK ME TO SELL NO MOUNTAINS. WELL, I WON'T. I CAN'T. THEY SAY THAT IF SHE'S CAREFUL FOR 5, MAYBE 10, YEARS, SHE MIGHT OUTGROW SOME OF WHAT'S WRONG WITH HER. BUT SHE'S GOT TO BE PATIENT. SHE WON'T BE PATIENT MUCH LONGER. BUT SHE'S A CHILD. SHE DOESN'T KNOW HER OWN MIND. IF I DO WHAT SHE WANTS... YOU DON'T KNOW. YOU DON'T REALIZE. SHE COULD BE GONE IN A MATTER OF HOURS. ANYTHING-- THE LEAST EXERTION-- AND THAT COULD BE IT. SHE HAD A LUNG OPERATION WHEN SHE WAS 14... ANOTHER WHEN SHE WAS 18. SHE'S HAD PNEUMONIA TWICE. DON'T YOU SEE THE RISK I TAKE IF I GIVE IN TO HER? IT'S A RISK YOU'VE GOT TO TAKE, SAM. YOU HAVEN'T MUCH CHOICE. [DOOR OPENS] I GUESS I'M JUST A BIG IDIOT, BUT...OK. OK. TELL HER I AGREE TO EVERYTHING SHE WANTS. I'M MAKING PROMISES I KNOW ARE DEAD WRONG, BUT WHAT ELSE CAN I DO? SHE'S WHAT MY LIFE'S ABOUT. HOW CAN I THANK YOU, FELLA? COME ON. I'M BEING A BAD GUEST OF HONOR. BUT DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE THAT SAM CAN KEEP HIS PROMISES? I MEAN, EVEN IF HE BELIEVES-- I'M SURE HE WILL. BECAUSE...I CANNOT GO THROUGH IT AGAIN. I DON'T SUPPOSE HE CAN, EITHER. DO YOU--DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE PEOPLE CAN CHANGE? UP TO A POINT. THANK YOU. COULD YOU? IF I HAD SUFFICIENT REASON, AND SAM HAS. BUT YOU KNOW, CHRISTINE, YOU--YOU MUSTN'T EXPECT HIM TO CHANGE OVERNIGHT. HE HAS TO SEE YOU IN A NEW LIGHT... AND THAT'S NOT EASY, ESPECIALLY FOR SOMEBODY WHO-- [WOMAN LAUGHS] Woman: NATURALLY, ONE CAN'T BE ON EVERY BEST-DRESSED LIST, BUT TO BE BLITZED BY-- MURRAY, LET'S GO. ...WHOSE HUSBAND MADE IT PUSHING HAPPY PILLS. PIERRE WAS REALLY VERY SWEET ABOUT IT. HE SAID THE CURLS COULDN'T HAVE LOOKED WORSE IF SHE PUT THEM ON ONE OF HER HORSES. HA HA HA! CHRISTINE! ORDER ME A VODKA GIBSON-- A DOUBLE. WELL, THIS IS A SURPRISE. I'D HEARD YOU WERE IN CUERNAVACA. I GOT BACK YESTERDAY. HOW'S YOUR SISTER? I HEAR SHE'S UNLOADED HER BAVARIAN LIFEGUARD. MARIAN'S FINE. YOU NEED A SCOREBOARD TO KEEP TRACK OF PEOPLE THESE DAYS, MR., UH... MURRAY LOGAN. I'M NINA GELLERT. WE'VE MET, HAVEN'T WE? PALM BEACH? I DON'T THINK SO. WELL, I MUSTN'T KEEP YOU TWO. WE SHOULD LUNCH SOON, DEAR. GOOD-BYE. THEY'RE A VERY ATTRACTIVE COUPLE. WHO ARE THEY? HIS NAME IS MURRAY LOGAN OR LOGAN MURRAY-- ONE OR THE OTHER. SHE IS MY DAUGHTER. UH...I--I'M ALWAYS LIKE THIS WHEN I SEE HER. I PANIC AND WANT TO RUN. OH, IT'S RIDICULOUS. WE ALL HAVE SOMEONE WE FEEL LIKE THAT ABOUT. OH, BUT SHE'S EVERYTHING I'M AFRAID I MIGHT BE-- SELFISH AND UNLOVING. MURRAY, I DON'T LOOK LIKE HER, DO I? I--I DON'T SOUND LIKE HER? NOT IN THE LEAST. I'M SORRY. YOU HAVEN'T EVEN HAD A CHANCE TO GET YOUR COFFEE. Murray: YOU KNOW, EVERYTHING ABOUT GREECE IS LIKE THAT. IT'S SIMPLE, IMMEDIATE, AND UNCHANGING, AND THE VALUES OF OUR WORLD SUDDENLY SEEM VERY REMOTE AND UNIMPORTANT. SORRY. I'M INDULGING MYSELF. IT'S THE CLOSEST YOU'VE COME TO TALKING ABOUT YOURSELF. I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT YOU... EXCEPT WHAT SAM'S TOLD ME. AND WHAT DID SAM TELL YOU? HOW MUCH EVERYONE LIKED YOU, THAT YOU'RE REGARDED AS THE CONSCIENCE OF ATLANTIC HOUSE, THAT YOU USED TO WRITE AND--AND HAD A NOVEL PUBLISHED AT 24. 25, ACTUALLY. IT WAS WUTHERING HEIGHTS IN THE AEGEAN-- PRETTY BAD. THE TROUBLE WAS, AT THE TIME, I DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT LOVE OR DESPERATION. DO YOU WRITE NOW? NO. I'VE NEVER TRIED ANOTHER BOOK. I WRITE AN OCCASIONAL ARTICLE FOR A MAGAZINE. THAT'S ALL I HAVE TIME FOR. WHAT ELSE DID SAM TELL YOU ABOUT? HE SPOKE ABOUT AN ACCIDENT AND ABOUT YOUR WIFE. AND MY SON? WHAT WAS HIS NAME? MARTIN. I'D HOPED TO LIVE MY LIFE AGAIN THROUGH THE CHILD, BUT AFTER TIME, ONE LEARNS NOT TO FEEL--TO RETREAT. YOU FIND A WAY TO GO ON LIVING. IS THAT ENOUGH-- JUST TO GO ON LIVING? OH! WE BETTER GO. OH, IS IT 5:00 ALREADY? YES. I--I'D RATHER WE SAID GOOD-BYE HERE. MAY I WRITE YOU? I--I'D LIKE TO, IF YOU DON'T MIND. PLEASE. ♪ SOMEWHERE OVER THE RAINBOW ♪ ♪ BLUEBIRDS FLY ♪ [DOOR CLOSES] ♪ BIRDS FLY... ♪ MURRAY? HELLO. DON'T TURN IT OFF. WELL, I'VE HAD IT. I'VE BEEN LISTENING TO IT ALL AFTERNOON. HOW HAVE YOU BEEN? OH, AS WELL AS COULD BE EXPECTED. HOW WAS YOUR TRIP? I GOT YOUR CABLE. WE WERE AN HOUR LATE. UH! JETS. OH, I MADE A NEW SHADE. PRETTY? YES, IT'S VERY NICE. WELL, IT GIVES ME SOMETHING TO DO WITH MY TIME. YOU MIGHT HAVE PHONED ME YOURSELF FROM THE OFFICE. I'M SORRY. I WAS WITH KENDRICK ALL THE AFTERNOON. OH, YES, OF COURSE. Wife: MURRAY. YOU LOOK NICE. I SUPPOSE IT'S MEANT TO BE VERY GLAMOROUS. I HOPE THEY DIDN'T HOLD YOU UP FOR THIS. NO. I WANTED TO BRING YOU SOMETHING FROM AMERICA. WELL, IT'S JUST THE THING TO EXCITE THE GROCER'S BOY. NOBODY ELSE IS LIKELY TO SEE IT. SYBIL, LET'S GO AWAY SOMEWHERE THIS SUMMER-- ANYWHERE YOU LIKE. WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO TO PARIS OR ROME? YOU'VE JUST BEEN AWAY. I'M THINKING OF YOU. YOU NEVER GET OUT OF HERE. IT'D BE A CHANGE. NO, IT WOULDN'T BE A CHANGE. YOU KNOW I CAN'T STAND BEING STARED AT. THOUGH I SUPPOSE IT MAKES YOU FEEL GENEROUS SUGGESTING IT. OTHERWISE, YOU WOULDN'T DO IT, KNOWING HOW I FEEL. I KNOW YOU DON'T LIKE TO BE REMINDED OF IT, BUT YOU DO HAPPEN TO BE RESPONSIBLE, YOU KNOW. OH, I KNOW WHY YOU'RE SUGGESTING A TRIP. YOU HAD QUITE A TIME IN NEW YORK, AND YOU'RE FEELING GUILTY ABOUT IT. DON'T LET'S DISCUSS IT, THEN. WHY NOT? WE'RE ADULTS... AND I SEEM TO REMEMBER YOU AS A PASSIONATE SORT OF FELLOW. I'D HAVE HAD A TIME OF IT IF I'D BEEN YOU. I'D HAVE HAD A BALL! YOU KNOW, MURRAY, WHEN YOU WERE AWAY, IT WAS AWFULLY LONELY AROUND HERE... LONELIER THAN USUAL. [HUMMING OVER THE RAINBOW] ♪ THERE'S A LAND THAT I LONG FOR... ♪ [TELEPHONE RINGS] YES, MRS. PRITCHARD? OH, HE DID? I'LL BE RIGHT OVER. I HAVE TO SEE THE BOSS. OH, LESLIE'S CONTRACTS CAME IN. WILL YOU LOOK THEM OVER? CHARLES, YOU WANTED TO SEE ME. I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. I'VE GOT THE HUNGARIAN COUNTESS IN THE BOARDROOM WITH A NEW VERSION OF HER MEMOIRS. DO YOU WANT ME TO SEE HER? NO. I GOT MYSELF INTO THIS. I'LL GET MYSELF OUT. GO ALONG IN. THERE'S A FRIEND OF YOURS IN THERE. LILY! I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE HERE. HOW GOOD TO SEE YOU. NOW, NONE OF THAT. I'M VERY CROSS WITH YOU, MURRAY. WHY? YOU'VE BEEN BACK FROM AMERICA MORE THAN A WEEK AND HAVEN'T EVEN TELEPHONED. I'VE BEEN MEANING TO. I'M SORRY. YES, WELL, SHOW YOUR REMORSE AND COME TO DINNER ON FRIDAY. IT'S OUR 30th WEDDING ANNIVERSARY. CHARLES SEEMS TO THINK IT'S SOME CAUSE FOR CELEBRATION. HE'S RIGHT. YOURS IS THE HAPPIEST MARRIAGE I'VE EVER SEEN. MURRAY, I REALIZE HOW DIFFICULT IT WOULD BE TO PERSUADE SYBIL TO COME TO OUR PARTY. YES, IT WOULD. I UNDERSTAND. I'M SORRY. OH, IT'S SUCH A PITY. YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES I THINK I'M TO BLAME FOR SOME OF WHAT HAPPENED. YOU REMEMBER WHEN YOU FIRST TURNED DOWN CHARLES' OFFER TO WORK HERE AND WENT OFF TO GREECE? I WAS ENCHANTED. RIGHT OR WRONG, YOU'D MADE YOUR OWN CHOICE. YOU WERE GOING TO DO WHAT YOU WANTED. SO I WAS DISAPPOINTED WHEN YOU GOT BACK AND STARTED BRINGING SYBIL AROUND. I DIDN'T WANT TO SEE YOU TIED DOWN. OH, IT'S ALL SUCH A LONG TIME AGO, BUT IT WAS MEDDLING AND VERY WRONG OF ME. IT WOULDN'T HAVE MADE MUCH DIFFERENCE. EVEN SO, I'D LIKE TO SET THINGS RIGHT. YOU WILL TALK TO HER AND TRY? I'LL TALK TO HER. AND GIVE HER MY LOVE. Sybil: HER LOVE? DON'T MAKE A SCENE JUST BECAUSE LILY'S ASKED YOU TO A PARTY. I'M NOT MAKING A SCENE. IT'S JUST THAT I CAN DO VERY WELL WITHOUT HER ARTY-SMARTY PARTIES, THANK YOU. I'VE DONE WITHOUT THEM FOR THE PAST 12 YEARS. WHO DOES SHE THINK SHE IS? AND THAT DREARY HUSBAND OF HERS. Christine: DEAR MURRAY, I'M IN TOWN JUST FOR THE DAY. I CAME IN FOR A ROUTINE CHECKUP, SO I'M ENJOYING MY DAY REMEMBERING OUR AFTERNOON TOGETHER. WRITING TO YOU IS GIVING ME A GREAT AND PROBABLY SELFISH SATISFACTION. I WONDER IF WRITING TO ME WOULD DO THE SAME FOR YOU, BUT IT'S A PLEASURE I'LL HAVE TO DO WITHOUT. IT WOULD HURT SAM TOO MUCH TO KNOW I'VE TOLD YOU SO MUCH. OH, MOST TERRIFIC NEWS! BELOW THE ANGELS GOT THE BOOK OF THE YEAR PRIZE! CHARLES HAD A WIRE. WELL, YOU COULD SHOW SOME ENTHUSIASM. HE'S YOUR AUTHOR. I'M SORRY, DICKIE. IT'S FABULOUS, OF COURSE. Christine: DEAR MURRAY, I WISH YOU'D SEEN MORE OF CONNECTICUT. ONCE YOU GET FURTHER INTO THE COUNTRY, IT'S EVEN MORE BEAUTIFUL. SOMETIMES I--I DRIVE DOWN TO THE BEACH WHERE I SPENT SO MUCH TIME AS A CHILD, AND IT EASES MY LONELINESS FOR A WHILE, BUT THEN THERE ARE TIMES WHEN IT BECOMES UNBEARABLE AGAIN, AND MY ONLY THOUGHT IS THAT THE ONE PERSON I CAN TELL THESE THINGS TO LIVES THOUSANDS OF MILES AWAY FROM ME. [ROCK MUSIC BLARING] Christine: I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE IT, BUT IT'S TRUE. WE'RE COMING TO EUROPE FOR A MONTH. SAM THINKS THAT A SEA TRIP WILL DO ME GOOD. HE SENDS HIS LOVE. HE WON'T BE ABLE TO BE SAILING WITH ME BECAUSE BUSINESS WILL KEEP HIM HERE THROUGH THE WEEK, BUT HE HOPES TO FLY OVER THE FOLLOWING WEEKEND. SAM'S MADE RESERVATIONS FOR US AT THE SAVOY OVERLOOKING THE RIVER. MURRAY. WHAT DO WE SAY? I'M NOT VERY GOOD AT GREETINGS. NEITHER AM I. I'VE GOT A TAXI. WE CAN'T KEEP ATLANTIC HOUSE WAITING. THE KENDRICKS ARE GIVING YOU LUNCH. AND ON YOUR FIRST VISIT, EVERYTHING SHOULD HAVE BEEN PERFECT. I'M AFRAID SAM WILL NEVER FORGIVE US THIS WEATHER. [QUIETLY] YOU DIDN'T TELL ME. THAT'S A FASCINATING YOUNG WOMAN. I HAVE THE FEELING SHE'S NOT ALTOGETHER AT PEACE WITH HERSELF. SHE REMINDS ME A LITTLE OF THE WAY YOU WERE WHEN YOU DECIDED TO LEAVE ENGLAND. HA HA HA! TELL ME, CHRISTINE, HOW LONG DO YOU AND SAM PLAN TO STAY IN GREECE? WELL, AT LEAST TWO WEEKS-- MAYBE 3 IF SAM CAN FIND THE TIME. OH, THERE'S--THERE'S SO MUCH I WANT TO SEE. PERHAPS YOU SHOULD TALK TO MURRAY. HE'S LIVED IN GREECE. I HAVE SOME BOOKS I COULD LEND YOU AND A FEW MAPS I'VE MARKED OUT. I'VE BEEN READING BOOKS ALL MY LIFE. NOW I WANT TO SEE IT FOR MYSELF. ANYWAY, I TALKED TO MURRAY COMING OVER HERE IN THE TAXI. SAM WAS HOPING HE AND SYBIL COULD COME WITH US TO GREECE. I'M AFRAID IT'S IMPOSSIBLE. I CAN'T GET AWAY. Dickie: HERE'S AN EXCITING THOUGHT. I'VE A HOLIDAY COMING UP. Lily: CHRISTINE, IF YOU'RE FREE THIS AFTERNOON, THERE ARE SOME PAINTINGS I'D LIKE YOU TO SEE. I'LL HAVE YOU TO MYSELF FOR A WHILE. [CLOCK CHIMING] OH! HAVE YOU BEEN HERE LONG? TAKE IT EASY. YOU'RE ALL OUT OF BREATH. YOU LOOK EXHAUSTED. HA HA! LILY'S INCREDIBLE. WE WENT THROUGH 3 EXHIBITS, AND THEN SHE WANTED ME TO GO HOME WITH HER AND SEE HER PAINTINGS. DID YOU TELL HER YOU WERE MEETING ME? I SAID I HAD TO GO BACK TO THE HOTEL TO WAIT FOR A CALL FROM SAM. MURRAY, I WANT TO MEET SYBIL. SUPPOSE I TELEPHONE AND-- SHE'D SAY NO. I KNOW SHE WOULD. WE NEVER HAVE PEOPLE AT THE HOUSE. LILY TOLD ME. I STILL WANT TO TRY. CHRISTINE, I... THERE MUST BE SOME WAY. I WANT THIS TRIP, MURRAY. I WANT IT DESPERATELY. IF THERE WAS ANY HOPE AT ALL, I'D SAY GO AHEAD AND TRY, BUT THERE ISN'T. IT'S FOOLISH FOR EITHER OF US TO THINK-- OH, MURRAY! BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME THINGS BETWEEN SYBIL AND ME THAT NOBODY KNOWS. I DON'T LIKE TALKING ABOUT MYSELF, BUT... I'M RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT HAPPENED TO SYBIL. OH, MURRAY, PLEASE. I MET SYBIL WHEN I FIRST GOT BACK FROM GREECE. I'D COME BACK BECAUSE MY BOOK WAS BEING PUBLISHED, AND I DIDN'T EXPECT TO STAY LONGER THAN A FEW WEEKS. MY AFFAIR WITH SYBIL BEGAN CASUALLY, AND BEFORE I KNEW IT, I WAS CAUGHT UP IN A VILE AND HUNGRY WAY. WE WERE MARRIED WHEN SHE WAS 3 MONTHS PREGNANT, AND I WENT TO WORK AT ATLANTIC HOUSE. IF I HAD ANY DOUBTS ABOUT THE MARRIAGE, I THOUGHT THE CHILD WOULD SAVE IT. IN TRUTH, EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE HAPPENED. IT WAS NOW SYBIL WHO FELT TRAPPED, WHILE I LET MY WORK AND MARTIN BECOME MY LIFE. WHEN MARTIN WAS 3, WE DROVE TO THE COUNTRY ONE WEEKEND. ON THE WAY HOME, WE STARTED TO QUARREL. SHE ALWAYS FELT MY FRIENDS DIDN'T ACCEPT HER. ...PRETENDING I WASN'T EVEN THERE! I TOLD HER SHE IMAGINED THESE THINGS. SHE SAID I WAS THE ONE THAT IMAGINED THINGS. IF ANYBODY'S IMAGINING THINGS, IT'S YOU. I KNEW SHE WANTED A ROW. IMAGINING THIS KID IS YOURS, FOR INSTANCE. PERHAPS I HALF-BELIEVED WHAT SHE SAID. I DON'T KNOW. I CAN'T BE SURE. CAN'T YOU IMAGINE OTHER MEN WANTING ME OR ME WANTING OTHER MEN? [CAR HORN HONKING] YOU'RE NOT AS GOOD AS ALL THAT, YOU KNOW. YOU NEVER HAVE BEEN. AAH! THE BOY DIED. SYBIL WENT TO HOSPITAL FOR 4 MONTHS. THE FIRST TIME THEY LET ME SEE HER, SHE TOLD ME THAT WHAT SHE SAID ABOUT THE CHILD WASN'T TRUE AND THAT I KNEW IT. THAT WAS ALMOST 7 YEARS AGO. WELL, THAT'S THE WHOLE UGLY STORY, EXCEPT THAT TWO YEARS AGO, I FELT THAT WE COULDN'T GO ON AS WE WERE. I SUGGESTED THAT WE SEPARATE. SHE AGREED. THEN THE FIRST NIGHT I WAS AWAY, SHE TRIED TO KILL HERSELF WITH SLEEPING PILLS. NOW YOU SEE WHY SYBIL WOULD NEVER FORGET WHAT'S HAPPENED OR LET ME FORGET. I TOLD HER SHE COULD COME IF SHE LIKED. DON'T BE SURPRISED IF I GET A MIGRAINE AT THE LAST MINUTE. SUIT YOURSELF. IS SHE VERY AMERICAN-- LOUD? NONE OF THE OTHER PEOPLE FROM ATLANTIC HOUSE EVER TRIED TO FORCE THEIR WAY IN HERE. I THINK IT'S RATHER PECULIAR. WHAT'S PECULIAR ABOUT IT? JUST IS, THAT'S ALL. HAS SHE GOT ANY CHILDREN? NO. IS SHE PRETTY-- THE GLAMOROUS TYPE? DOES SHE DRESS WELL? WITH ALL THAT MONEY, SHE SHOULD. DOES SHE KNOW WHAT I LOOK LIKE? WELL, IF SHE'S COMING TO TEA, I DON'T WANT TO LOOK LIKE SOMETHING DRAGGED OUT OF A DUSTBIN. I'LL NEED A NEW DRESS. WELL, BUY ONE. IT WILL PROBABLY BE EXPENSIVE. VERY WELL. Sybil: THAT'S QUITE A CAR. WE'VE NEVER HAD ANYTHING THAT GRAND AT OUR FRONT GATE. OH, IT'S JUST A HIRED ONE. OH, IS THAT WHAT IT IS? I'LL COME OVER ONE DAY. WE CAN GO FOR A DRIVE. OH, I DON'T GO OUT VERY MUCH. DIDN'T MURRAY TELL YOU? WITH THIS, WOULD YOU WANT TO BE SEEN? I'M SURE I WOULD IF I LOOKED LIKE YOU. I HATE BEING STARED AT. [RING] IT'S RATHER LIKE FLIES THAT YOU CAN'T BRUSH AWAY. I DON'T LIKE PEOPLE TO PITY ME. I UNDERSTAND. I USED TO FEEL THAT WAY MYSELF ALL THE TIME... WHEN--WHEN I WAS ILL. I'VE LEARNED MOST OF THE TIME PEOPLE DON'T REALLY CARE ENOUGH TO PITY US. YOU KNOW, I'D GO OFF MY HEAD IF IT WASN'T FOR THE TELLY AND THAT GRAMOPHONE. HA HA! BUT... DON'T YOU EVER WANT TO GET AWAY? GET AWAY? WHERE? OH, INTO LONDON, TO THE THEATER. TRAVEL, EVEN. WELL, HOW DO YOU MEAN, TRAVEL? ABROAD? WELL, YOU MUST WANT TO SEE NEW PLACES. HOW DO YOU LIKE YOUR TEA? OH, WITH MILK, PLEASE. WHAT DID YOU MEAN WHEN YOU ASKED ME IF I WANTED TO GET AWAY? I HAVE AN IDEA. HA HA! NO, THAT'S NOT TRUE, ACTUALLY. IT'S SAM'S AND MY IDEA. WHY DON'T YOU COME TO GREECE WITH US-- YOU AND MURRAY? WE'RE LEAVING IN A WEEK, AND IT WOULD BE WONDERFUL IF WE COULD ALL GO TOGETHER. TO GREECE? OH, PLEASE, THINK ABOUT IT. WELL, WHY US? YOU MUST HAVE OTHER FRIENDS YOU COULD GO WITH. WE... WE WANT TO GO WITH THE TWO OF YOU. OH, SYBIL, YOU'D-- YOU'D ENJOY IT. HA HA! I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND MY CALLING YOU SYBIL. WHY SHOULD I? HA HA! MURRAY AND I ALREADY CALL EACH OTHER BY OUR FIRST NAMES. IT DOESN'T TAKE LONG IN AMERICA. NO. NOTHING DOES, I'M TOLD. [DOOR CLOSES] Sybil: HELLO. SORRY I'M LATE. DID YOU HAVE ANY TROUBLE FINDING YOUR WAY? NO. YOUR DIRECTIONS WERE FINE. IT TOOK EVEN LESS TIME THAN YOU SAID IT WOULD. CHRISTINE AND I HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT HER TRIP TO GREECE. DID YOU KNOW SHE WAS GOING? YES. WE TALKED ABOUT IT AT LUNCH AT ATLANTIC HOUSE. OH. I DIDN'T KNOW THERE HAD BEEN A LUNCH. DID YOU TELL HIM ABOUT YOUR HUSBAND'S IDEA? I SUPPOSE YOU SAID I WOULDN'T GO, THAT I NEVER GO ANYWHERE. HOW DO YOU GET TO GREECE? DO YOU FLY? Christine: WE'D HAVE TO WITH THE TIME SAM HAS. IT MEANS I'D HAVE TO GO INTO LONDON AND GET A PASSPORT. IT MEANS I'D HAVE TO HAVE PHOTOGRAPHS TAKEN. [TELEPHONE RINGS] [RING] Murray: HELLO. YES, THIS IS MURRAY LOGAN. YES, I'LL TAKE IT. NO, NO, IT'S ALL RIGHT. IT DOESN'T MATTER. OH, SAM, I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY TO HEAR THAT. I HOPE SO, YES. YES, YES, I UNDERSTAND. WELL, HOW SERIOUS IS IT? WHO IS IT? WHAT'S WRONG? SAM. CALLING FROM NEW YORK? SHE'S SO DEVOTED TO FREDERICK, SHE'D BE ON THE FIRST PLANE BACK. I, UM... I STARTED TO PHONE HER LAST NIGHT TO TELL HER THAT THE TRIP WAS OFF, BUT I COULDN'T. SHE HAS A FEELING THAT IF SHE DOESN'T GO NOW, SHE NEVER WILL, BUT, UH... I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL TO DO. WELL, LET ME THINK ABOUT IT, AND I'LL RING YOU TOMORROW. NO, I WON'T SAY A WORD. TRY NOT TO WORRY, SAM. BYE. WELL, WHAT WAS ALL THAT ABOUT? FREDERICK'S HAD ANOTHER ATTACK. SAM WON'T BE ABLE TO GET AWAY FROM NEW YORK FOR A WHILE. OH, DOES THAT MEAN OUR TRIP'S OFF? I WAS PLANNING TO GO TO LONDON TOMORROW AND GET MY PASSPORT. WHY ARE YOU STARING? REALLY, YOU ARE A CARD. YOU WERE AFTER ME FOR MONTHS TO GET OUT AND GO SOMEWHERE, AND WHEN I FINALLY AGREE-- WHAT'S THE MATTER? DON'T YOU WANT TO GO? Woman on P.A.: OUR FLIGHT WILL TAKE US OVER NAPLES AND THE NORTHERN PELOPONNESUS. WE EXPECT TO LAND AT HELLINIKON AIRPORT AT 1715 ATHENS TIME. WE WILL MAINTAIN AN ALTITUDE OF 35,000 FEET. THANK YOU. [WOMAN ON P.A. SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] WE SYRIANS ARE VERY CONSCIOUS OF OUR TIES WITH GREECE AND ROME. BEFORE I DECIDED TO FOLLOW MEDICINE, I TOOK MY MAJOR IN ARCHAEOLOGY. I RETURN TO GREECE EVERY CHANCE I GET. YOUR GLASSES, MRS. LOGAN. [DRUNKENLY] SHE'S MRS. BONNER. I'M MRS. LOGAN. OH, I APOLOGIZE. FORGIVE ME. Woman on P.A.: TO THE LEFT OF THE AIRCRAFT, YOU CAN SEE THE MEDITERRANEAN. IMMEDIATELY BELOW, FIUMICINO AIRPORT IN OSTIA. [WOMAN ON P.A. SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] OH, SYBIL, LOOK AT THIS. OH, LET ME ENJOY MY THRILLER. I AM AT A VERY SEXY PAGE. TELL ME, DOCTOR, HAVE YOU EVER BEEN TO CLARA WHAT'S-HER-NAME'S VILLA UP ON THE HILL? YOU KNOW WHO I MEAN-- OLD MUSSO'S MISTRESS. I HEAR IT'S THE POSHEST RESTAURANT IN ROME. NO, MRS. LOGAN. NO, NO, I HAVE NOT BEEN THERE. IT'S THE ONE PLACE I'D CARE TO SEE. YOU CAN KEEP GREECE AND ALL ITS RUINS. THANK YOU. NO. I WON'T BE NEEDING THAT. MY TREAT! I'LL MEET YOU UP AT THE TOP! [MAN SPEAKING GREEK] ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? I'M JUST A LITTLE OUT OF BREATH. I'M--I'M FINE. Sybil: AH, THERE YOU ARE. WELCOME TO THE GLORIFIED JUNKYARD. IF YOUR GREEK FRIENDS ARE SO SMART, WHY DIDN'T THEY BUILD AN ESCALATOR? HA HA! YOU LOOK AS IF YOU COULD HAVE USED ONE. YOU TWO GO ON. AREN'T YOU GOING TO SEE THE PARTHENON? NO. I'M ENJOYING MYSELF HERE. YOU GO ON. AND HAVE A BALL. [KNOCK ON DOOR] Sybil: COME IN. [DOOR OPENS] WELL, WHO SENT US THESE? OH. YES, SIR. EFHARISTO. THANK YOU. HA HA HA! WHAT'S THE JOKE? &quot;HAVE A WONDERFUL TIME. &quot;STILL HOPE TO JOIN YOU IF I CAN. THANK YOU FOR LOOKING AFTER CHRISTINE.&quot; SIGNED, &quot;GRATEFULLY, SAM.&quot; HA HA! OH, SHUT UP, SYBIL. OH, I BET THIS PLACE IS COSTING A PRETTY PENNY. IS SHE PAYING FOR THE HEARSE WE'RE RIDING IN? NO. WE'RE GOING HALVES. WHY? IT WAS HER IDEA. TELL ME, DID YOU NOTICE THAT LOOK THE MAN ON THE PLANE GAVE ME? I DON'T MEAN YOUR DREARY ARAB FRIEND. IT WASN'T MY FACE HE WAS LOOKING AT. IN THIS PART OF THE WORLD, THAT KIND OF LOOK IS CONSIDERED A COMPLIMENT. WELL, I DON'T LIKE IT. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? I'M GOING TO SEND A CABLE. TO GRATEFULLY SAM? I SUPPOSE YOU'D BETTER, OR HE'LL BE WAKING US UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT AGAIN TO BE SURE THAT WE'RE LOOKING AFTER DEAR LITTLE CHRISTINE... THOUGH I MUST SAY, IT'S ALL VERY PECULIAR IN MORE WAYS THAN ONE. WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? IT'S ALL RIGHT IF SHE'S IN LOVE WITH YOU, BUT YOU'D BE AN IDIOT TO FALL IN LOVE WITH HER. IF YOU THINK I'M GOING TO DISCUSS THIS NONSENSE, YOU'RE VERY MUCH-- I'M THE ONE THAT'S DISCUSSING IT. YOU MIGHT THINK ABOUT IT WHILE YOU'RE WIRING DEAR OLD SAM. YOU AND HE ARE SUCH CHUMS. I DON'T EVEN THINK SHE'S PRETTY. SHE'S THIN AS A BEAN. Man: AH, MRS. BONNER, MR. AND MRS. LOGAN. HOW DO YOU DO? I'M VERY GLAD TO SEE YOU AGAIN. BEAUTIFUL DAY. TODAY, I HAVE A WONDERFUL PROGRAM-- MOST INSTRUCTIVE AND ENTERTAINING. FIRST WE GO TO THE MONASTERY OF KAISARIANI. Driver: THIS BYZANTINE MONASTERY WAS FOUNDED IN THE 11th CENTURY A.D. THESE OTHER BUILDINGS OVER THERE WERE BUILT MUCH LATER IN THE 17th CENTURY. THE MONKS WERE CULTIVATING LETTERS, PHILOSOPHY, AND LITERATURE. AT THE SAME TIME, THEY WERE MAKING THE VERY FAMOUS HONEY OF HYMETTOS. Man: IN THE BEST FAMILY TRADITION, HE RAVISHED DEMETER HIS SISTER, THEN HAD A SON-- A MOST OBJECTIONABLE GIANT-- BY HIS GRANDMOTHER EARTH BEFORE HE BEGAN COURTING THE SEA NYMPH THETIS TO HAVE A SPOUSE SO HE'D FEEL AT HOME IN THE DEPTHS OF THE SEA. AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED, I'D SETTLE FOR ONE REAL MAN IN A BUSINESS SUIT. OH, SYBIL. Murray: SYBIL! SYBIL. THERE YOU ARE. I'VE BEEN LOOKING ALL OVER THE PLACE FOR YOU. WE LOST YOU FOR A MOMENT. IT'S ABSOLUTELY DREADFUL. THEY JUST STAND THERE GAZING AT YOU AND PICKING THEIR TEETH. LEAVING ME ALONE WITH A BUNCH OF MANIC-DEPRESSIVES... MURRAY, I'M NOT VERY HUNGRY. SYBIL, WE ARRANGED THIS-- OH, SYBIL, PLEASE. IT--IT'S NICE BY THE WATER. I'M GOING BACK TO THE HOTEL. I'M NOT ROMANTIC LIKE YOU AND CHRISTINE. I'M SICK OF SMELLS AND ART AND CROWDS. ANY OBJECTIONS? TAKE MRS. LOGAN BACK TO THE HOTEL. WE'LL WAIT FOR YOU HERE. I'M SORRY ABOUT THIS, MURRAY. I REALLY HOPED SHE'D ENJOY THIS TRIP. I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE... MAYBE IF SHE THOUGHT YOU WERE WITH HER MORE, OR... MAYBE IF I WENT OFF WITH ANDREAS. IT'S NOT AS SIMPLE AS THAT. I WAS WRONG. [MAN SPEAKING GREEK] HOW LONG DO YOU THINK WE CAN GO ON LIKE THIS? IS IT POSSIBLE... FEELING ABOUT YOU THE WAY I DO? I'VE SAID IT. WE'VE BOTH SAID IT... FROM THE BEGINNING. [SPEAKING ITALIAN] THAT'S ITALIAN. JUST MAKE IT STRAIGHT GIN. Man: FILATSES. WHAT? CLARA WHAT'S- HER-NAME'S VILLA-- THAT'S WHAT IT'S CALLED. MUSSO'S MISTRESS. I COULD HAVE TOLD YOU ON THE PLANE, ONLY I WASN'T SURE I'D BE WELCOME. IT'S A RELIEF TO TALK TO SOMEONE FROM HOME. OH, MY NAME IS GROVES-- LEN GROVES. THIS YOUR FIRST TRIP TO ATHENS? BLOODY BORING PLACE, IF YOU ASK ME. ANYTIME YOU'RE TIRED OF RUINS, I COULD SHOW YOU A COUPLE OF SPOTS NOT LISTED IN THE AMUSEMENT GUIDES, IF YOU'D LIKE. YOU'LL FIND ME IN THE BAR HERE MOST OF THE TIME. WELL, DON'T GO. AT LEAST STAY AND HAVE YOUR DRINK. THERE'S--THERE'S SOMEONE WAITING FOR ME. STOP STARING, WILL YOU? I'VE BEEN STARED AT ENOUGH LATELY. THE CAR'S BEEN DOWNSTAIRS FOR HALF AN HOUR. WE HAVE A LONG DRIVE. DO WE? ISN'T THAT THRILLING? NATURALLY, THE TWO OF YOU NEVER BOTHERED TO LET ME IN ON YOUR LITTLE PLANS. YOU COULD HAVE TOLD ME LAST NIGHT. YOU WERE ASLEEP WHEN I CAME IN. DON'T GET INTO A STEW ABOUT IT. WON'T HURT HER LADYSHIP TO WAIT A FEW MINUTES. ARE WE GOING TO HAVE A REPETITION OF LAST NIGHT'S PERFORMANCE? I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. JUST BECAUSE I DON'T CARE TO WANDER AROUND A FILTHY WATERFRONT. WHY? DID HER LADYSHIP COMPLAIN? WELL, FOR YOUR INFORMATION AND HERS, I'VE GOT A FEW COMPLAINTS OF MY OWN-- SUCH AS BEING BORED TO DEATH IN THIS DREARY TOWN. OH, FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE, SYBIL. OH, I CAN IMAGINE WHAT IT WILL BE LIKE NEXT WEEK AT DELPHI AND PELOPO-WHATSIS. MADE TO FEEL LIKE ODD MAN OUT BY THE TWO OF YOU AFTER TRAIPSING HERE TO THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE FOR HER CONVENIENCE. IT'S NOT FOR ANYBODY'S CONVENIENCE! WE'RE HERE TO HAVE A GOOD TIME. YOU'RE HERE TO HAVE A GOOD TIME. I CAN THINK OF A FAR BETTER WAY OF DOING THAT. SYBIL. WHAT'S THE MATTER? YOU AFRAID YOUR GIRL WILL BE JEALOUS? SHE IS NOT MY GIRL. OH, SHE'S NOT? OH, DON'T TELL ME THE TWO OF YOU ARE STILL HOLDING HANDS? WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? OH, CUT IT OUT! MURRAY? MURRAY? YOU'LL BE SORRY! MURRAY! MURRAY! MURRAY? MURRAY! [MAN SPEAKING GREEK] Sybil: WILL THESE GO OUT TODAY? THEY'RE VERY IMPORTANT. YES, MADAM. THEY'RE GOING OUT TODAY. COULD I HAVE MY KEY, PLEASE? CERTAINLY. MADAM. THANK YOU. MADAM? [SPEAKING GREEK] CAN I STILL HAVE THAT DRINK? IF THIS TRIP HASN'T WORKED OUT EXACTLY AS WE'D PLANNED-- YOU CAN SAY THAT AGAIN. WE'D BETTER MAKE THE MOST OF THE TIME WE HAVE LEFT FOR ALL OUR SAKES. OH, WHAT SMASHING ENTERTAINMENT HAVE YOU COOKED UP FOR TONIGHT? AFTER DINNER, I THOUGHT WE'D GO TO THE SOUND-AND-LIGHT. [MAN NARRATING IN FRENCH] I'M NOT READY YET. OH! I THOUGHT YOU WERE THE BELLBOY. WHAT'S GOING ON HERE? WELL, WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE? I WAS HOPING THE TWO OF YOU'D STAY UP ON THAT DREARY HILL UNTIL AFTER I'D GONE. I'M LEAVING YOU, MY ANGEL. I'M OFF TO THE RIVIERA WITH LEONARD GROVES, IN CASE YOU'RE INTERESTED. AND FOR YOUR INFORMATION, HE DOESN'T CARE A DAMN ABOUT MY SCARS. HE SAYS ANYONE CAN SEE I'M STILL A BEAUTY. SAYS I'VE GOT THE BEST FIGURE HE'S EVER SEEN. SAYS I'VE GOT TO STOP BEING SENSITIVE ABOUT MYSELF, AND NO NONSENSE. HE'S FROM BIRMINGHAM. HE SELLS ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT ALL OVER EUROPE. SO NOBODY NEEDS TO FEEL SORRY FOR ME ANYMORE-- NOT YOU OR LILY KENDRICK OR YOUR SICK LITTLE FRIEND ACROSS THE HALL. WELL, WHAT'S THE MATTER? CAT GOT YOUR TONGUE? WHAT AM I EXPECTED TO SAY? WELL, I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT CONGRATULATE ME. YOU'RE ALWAYS AFTER ME TO GET OUT AND HAVE A CHANGE, SO THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING. IT WON'T LAST, BUT I DON'T CARE. THERE'S LITTLE ENOUGH FUN. YOU'VE GOT TO GRAB IT WHEN YOU CAN. AND LEN'S MY SORT OF MAN-- THE REAL MAN. [KNOCK ON DOOR] COME IN. YOU CAN TAKE ALL THESE DOWN. I'LL BE ALONG IN A MINUTE. SO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A NICE LITTLE HOLIDAY IN CANNES AND NICE AND ROME. AND YOU CAN STOW THIS FOR A LARK THE REST OF YOUR WHOLE BLOODY TOUR. I DON'T THINK I'VE FORGOTTEN ANYTHING. OH, YES. I WROTE YOU A NOTE AND PINNED IT ON YOUR PAJAMAS. I'VE WRITTEN PRETTY MUCH ALL I'VE TOLD YOU, SO KEEP IT. IT MIGHT COME IN HANDY. YOU CAN CHARGE ADULTERY. I JUST THOUGHT I'D SAY GOOD-BYE. RELAX, DEAR. HE'S ALL YOURS. [KNOCK ON DOOR] LONDON, SIR? I'M SORRY. TOMORROW'S FLIGHT IS ALL BOOKED. I'VE JUST TURNED DOWN A PARTY OF AMERICAN LADIES. HOWEVER, IF YOU WANT ME TO CHECK WITH THE OTHER AIRLINES-- NO. NEVER MIND. THANK YOU. WE'RE LEAVING FOR DELPHI IN THE MORNING. IN ARACHOVA, EVERYONE LIVE TO BE 100 YEAR OLD. BEST WATER IN GREECE. HEY! OUZO. GREEK NATIONAL DRINK. VERY GOOD FOR YOU. YOU LIKE IT? YES. TASTES LIKE ROOT BEER. IT'S VERY GOOD FOR THE DIGESTION. YES. [HONKS HORN] [KNOCK ON DOOR] I'VE JUST HAD A SESSION WITH ANDREAS ABOUT TOMORROW, IF YOU'RE NOT TOO TIRED. I FEEL WONDERFUL. WHAT DID HE SAY? WELL, HE THINKS WE OUGHT TO SEE THE AMPHITHEATER IN THE MORNING AND THEN THE SANCTUARY. THAT'S GOOD. WE CAN HAVE LUNCH HERE. THEN WE OUGHT TO DO THE CASTALIAN SPRINGS. YOU DON'T THINK THAT'S TOO MUCH? OF COURSE NOT. YOU KNOW, THE ANCIENT GREEKS BELIEVED THAT DELPHI WAS THE HUB OF THE WORLD. IF THAT'S TRUE, THE WHOLE UNIVERSE IS REVOLVING WITH US AT ITS CENTER. THAT'S A LOVELY THOUGHT. I NEVER DOUBTED IT FOR A MOMENT. COME HERE. I WANT TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING. WHY IS IT THAT EVERY PLACE WE SEE SEEMS TO BE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL? OR IS IT JUST MY IMAGINATION? A LITTLE OF BOTH. IT IS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL... WHEN YOU CHOOSE TO SEE IT THAT WAY. YOU'D BETTER GET SOME REST. GOOD NIGHT, MURRAY. GOOD NIGHT. WHY SHOULD WE LISTEN TO THE ORACLES OF APOLLO? CAN YOU HEAR THAT? I WAS DOING IT IN MY NORMAL VOICE. I COULD HEAR YOU PERFECTLY. I'LL DO IT A BIT LOWER. TRY IT AGAIN NOW. WHY SHOULD WE LISTEN TO THE ORACLES OF APOLLO AND TO THE SCREAMING OF THE BIRDS ABOUT OUR HEADS? FOR THEY WOULD HAVE IT THAT I AM DOOMED TO KILL MY FATHER. [PERSON APPLAUDING] DR. ARRAMAN. BRAVO! HELLO. HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN THERE? I'VE HEARD OEDIPUS MANY TIMES, BUT NEVER IN THE WAY I DID JUST NOW. IT'S NOT EVERY DAY THAT ONE SEES AN ENGLISH INTELLECTUAL PERFORMING GREEK TRAGEDY TRANSLATED BY AN IRISH POET. DR. ARRAMAN. HOW NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN. A PLEASURE, I ASSURE YOU. FROM THE WAY YOU LOOK, MRS. BONNER, IT IS CLEAR THAT GREECE HAS LIVED UP TO YOUR HOPES. HAVE YOU BEEN TO THE SANCTUARY? NO. WE'RE JUST ON OUR WAY. DO YOU MIND IF I ACCOMPANY YOU? PLEASE. YOU KNOW, THIS PLACE ACTS AS A MAGNET TO ME. PERHAPS SOME OF MY ANCESTORS CAME HERE FROM ACROSS THE SEA. I LIKE TO THINK SO. NOW, HERE IS WHERE THE ORACLE MADE HER PROPHECIES, SEATED ON A TRIPOD IN A CLOUD OF FUMES SURROUNDED BY PRIESTS WHO INTERPRETED HER UTTERANCES INTO ENIGMATIC VERSE. FOR MANY HUNDREDS OF YEARS, MEN WOULD COME TO SEE HER FROM ALL OVER TO ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT WARS, BUSINESS ENTERPRISES, AND WHETHER THE GODS FAVORED THEM IN MATTERS OF LOVE. THE--THE MOST CELEBRATED OF ALL GREEK MAXIMS WAS INSCRIBED THERE. &quot;KNOW THYSELF.&quot; IF ONLY ONE COULD. WILL YOU HAVE LUNCH WITH US, DR. ARRAMAN? YES. PLEASE DO. AFTERWARDS, WE CAN SEE THE SPRINGS TOGETHER. WELL, LUNCH WOULD BE VERY PLEASANT, BUT AS FOR THIS AFTERNOON, IT LOOKS AS IF THE GODS MAY BE WITHDRAWING THEIR FAVORS. [THUNDER] Arraman: YOUR DRIVER IS RIGHT. AT THIS TIME OF YEAR, THE GREEK WEATHER IS UNPREDICTABLE. WAIT TILL IT CLEARS A LITTLE. Man: MRS. BONNER? DID YOU RECEIVE YOUR TELEPHONE CALL? WHAT CALL? I LEFT WORD THAT YOU WERE TO BE INFORMED. THERE WAS A CALL WHILE YOU WERE OUT. FOR ME? FORTUNATELY, THERE IS A ROOM ON THE FLOOR. I CAN GIVE IT TO MRS. GELLERT WHEN SHE ARRIVES. SHE TELEPHONED THIS MORNING FROM ATHENS. SHE ASKED IF MRS. BONNER WAS STAYING HERE. OH, MURRAY, YOU ONLY MET HER ONCE. YOU DON'T KNOW HER. SHE DESTROYED MY SISTER'S LIFE! STOP IT! STOP IT. YOU DON'T HAVE TO SEE HER. WE CAN GO BEFORE SHE ARRIVES. WE'RE GOING TO DO EXACTLY AS WE PLANNED. WE'RE GOING TO CROSS THE GULF. THEN ON TO OLYMPIA. TOMORROW, WE'LL TAKE THE INLAND ROAD TO ATHENS. NOBODY'S GOING TO SPOIL THE TIME WE HAVE LEFT. TAKE THAT OFF AND PUT IT ON THE FLOOR. THANK YOU, MURRAY. THIS TRIP NO GOOD. VERY BAD IN RAIN. HELP ME GET THE REST OF THE BAGS. THEY'RE IN THE HALL NEAR THE DOOR. NOW, PLEASE, MR. LOGAN. PLEASE. THIS IS NOT WISE. WELL, I'M AFRAID WE HAVE NO ALTERNATIVE. I REALIZE I'M PRESUMPTUOUS, BUT I ASSURE YOU, MRS. BONNER SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO TRAVEL IN WEATHER LIKE THIS-- NOT ON OUR MOUNTAIN ROADS. IT'S DANGEROUS. RECKLESS. TO ANYONE WITH A TRAINED EYE-- I'LL LOOK AFTER HER. THANK YOU, DOCTOR. HERE. PUT THIS ON TO KEEP WARM. IF YOU FEEL THE SLIGHTEST CHILL, PROMISE YOU'LL TELL ME. I'M FINE, KNOWING WE HAVE A LITTLE TIME LEFT TOGETHER. IT'S BEGINNING TO CLEAR. I KNOW. IT'S GETTING WARM. WE'RE NOT FAR FROM THE FERRY NOW. IT'S OVER THOSE HILLS AND DOWN TO THE GULF. HOW MANY KILOMETERS TO THE FERRY, ANDREAS? I THINK WE'VE LOST A FRIEND THERE. I'M AFRAID WE HAVE. MURRAY. WHAT THE HELL IS HE DOING? ANDREAS! [ANDREAS SHOUTING IN GREEK] ALL RIGHT. GET OUT, QUICK. ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? YES. WE CAN GET IT OUT. [SPEAKING GREEK] CAR TOO HEAVY. CAN'T GO FORWARD, CAN'T GO BACK. WHAT TO DO NOW? YOU CRAZY? YOU MAD? IT'S MY CAR. SHUT UP AND GET ON WITH IT, EH? [SPEAKING GREEK] [REVVING ENGINE] THERE WE ARE. [SPEAKING GREEK] YOU STILL CRAZY. YES, I KNOW. YES, YOU'RE CRAZY. FOOL. YOU ALL RIGHT? NEVER BETTER. YOU'RE NOT ANGRY AT ANDREAS, ARE YOU? NO. CERTAINLY NOT. BEFORE, I AM VERY NERVOUS. TIRED. IN VERY BAD MOOD. IT'S BEEN QUITE A DAY FOR EVERYBODY. WHAT? WHY ARE WE STOPPING NOW? RETSINA. GREEK NATIONAL DRINK. VERY GOOD FOR THE DIGESTION. VERY GOOD FOR THE NERVES. WE COULD USE A LITTLE OF THAT. YIASOU. YIASOU. YIASOU. YIASOU. HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE? ABOUT 3 HOURS. [FERRY HORN BLOWING] [PLAYING GREEK MUSIC] [PEOPLE CLAPPING] [PEOPLE CHEERING] IS ONE HAPPIER, DO YOU THINK, WITH 10 YEARS OF HAPPINESS THAN IF ONE HAS 10 MINUTES OR 10 DAYS? I DON'T KNOW. I'VE NEVER HAD THE 10 YEARS. BECAUSE I'VE NEVER BEEN HAPPIER IN MY WHOLE LIFE. ME, TOO. IT MUST BE LIKE THIS ON YOUR ISLAND. AND WHAT TO NOW? TO... TO THE END OF OUR JOURNEY-- THE HAPPY END. [MAN SPEAKING GREEK] YES. YES, WHAT IS IT? DID YOU SAY MRS. BONNER WAS HERE? Waiter: YES, SIR. SHE'S AT THE TELEPHONE NOW. SHE'S CALLING FROM DELPHI. I'D BETTER GET IT. NO, I'LL GET IT, MURRAY. EFHARISTO. [SPEAKING GREEK] [NO AUDIO] LET ME TALK TO HER. MURRAY-- MRS. GELLERT, THIS IS MURRAY LOGAN. WHY DIDN'T YOU TWO WAIT FOR ME? I KNOW YOU GOT MY CALL. I SEE. SAM IS ARRIVING IN ATHENS TOMORROW NIGHT. WELL, I'M GLAD YOU ARE... BECAUSE YOUR WIFE HAS WRITTEN CERTAIN LETTERS, MR. LOGAN. SHE SENT THEM FROM ATHENS. TO SAM, TO THE KENDRICKS, TO HALF THE WORLD, FOR ALL I KNOW. I WAS IN PARIS WHEN SAM CALLED. I WISH HE HADN'T. I'D BE AT THE COLLECTIONS RIGHT NOW INSTEAD OF THIS HELLHOLE. MR. LOGAN, YOU HAVE INVOLVED CHRISTINE IN A CHEAP, SORDID AFFAIR. NOW, MRS. GELLERT, THIS IS BETWEEN SAM, CHRISTINE, AND MYSELF, AND I REFUSE TO DISCUSS IT ANYMORE. WHY DID SYBIL DO IT? IT--IT'S VICIOUS. AND FOR SAM TO HAVE CALLED MY MOTHER. I'M SURE HE ONLY DID IT TO PROTECT YOU FROM PEOPLE TALKING. OH, MURRAY, WHO'S GOING TO BELIEVE THAT NOW? NOT AFTER THOSE LETTERS. WHY SHOULD THEY? BECAUSE WE'RE INNOCENT, THAT'S WHY. ARE WE, MURRAY? Andreas: OH, MR. LOGAN! WHAT TIME WILL YOU WANT THE CADILLAC TOMORROW? UH, AT 11:00. WE'RE LEAVING FOR ATHENS. ATHENS? WHAT, YOU AND MRS. BONNER WILL NOT SEE OLYMPIA? I'M AFRAID NOT. THE STADIUM? THE GROVE? GOOD NIGHT, MR. LOGAN. GOOD NIGHT. OH, MURRAY! [SOBBING] MY DARLING, LET THEM THINK WHATEVER THEY WANT. THIS IS ALL WE HAVE FOR THE REST OF OUR LIVES. I LOVE YOU, MURRAY. I WAS AFRAID IT MIGHT BE TRUE-- THAT I WAS INCAPABLE OF LOVING. IT ISN'T TRUE, IS IT? OH... LOOK, THE LIGHT SEEMS TO BE RISING OUT OF THE EARTH. MM-HMM. ON THE ISLANDS, THE TOP OF THE BUILDINGS CATCH THE FIRST LIGHT, AND THE WATER'S STILL DARK. IN A LITTLE WHILE, IT TURNS THE COLOR OF WINE. OUR HOUSE IS ON TOP OF A HILL. WE HAVE A TERRACE LOOKING OUT ON THE SEA. THAT'S WHERE WE'LL HAVE LUNCH. WE'LL HAVE RETSINA, STUFFED VINE LEAVES, LAMB, HONEY CAKE, AND PICKLED BEKAFICO. HA HA! PICKLED WHAT? BEKAFICO. IT'S A SMALL BIRD THAT YOU CRUNCH TO BITS WITH YOUR TEETH. IT SOUNDS AWFUL. OR YOU CAN LIVE ON A STEADY DIET OF OLIVES AND OUZO. YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT TRUE THAT THIS IS ALL WE HAVE FOR THE REST OF OUR LIVES. MURRAY? HMM? MURRAY, HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE LIVING WITH ME, NEVER KNOWING FROM DAY TO DAY WHEN I'LL SUDDENLY BE SICK? I BELIEVE I CAN MAKE YOU WELL. SOMETIMES WE'RE LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE A SECOND CHANCE. TRUST ME, CHRISTINE. I LOVE YOU, MURRAY. [COUGHING] IS MRS. BONNER'S LUGGAGE DOWN YET? MRS. BONNER LEFT FOR ATHENS TWO HOURS AGO, SIR. SHE--SHE--SHE LEFT? A LADY CAME FOR HER-- AN AMERICAN LADY. DID SHE LEAVE A MESSAGE FOR ME? NO, SIR, NO MESSAGE. THANK YOU. [SPEAKING GREEK] HA HA HA! START BACK NOW, ANDREAS. MRS. BONNER? MRS. BONNER'S NOT COMING. BUT IS SHE-- SHE HAD TO LEAVE EARLIER THAN EXPECTED. WELL, COME ON. YES, SIR. [CAR HORN HONKING] Sybil: IT'S ALL RIGHT IF SHE'S IN LOVE WITH YOU, BUT YOU'D BE AN IDIOT TO FALL IN LOVE WITH HER. Man: TO ME, SHE'S JUST A SPOILED LITTLE EGOTIST USING HER POOR HEALTH AND HER MONEY TO GET HER OWN WAY. Sam: SHE'S IMMATURE. SHE DOESN'T KNOW HER OWN MIND. Man: OH, MR. LOGAN, I HAVE A MESSAGE FOR YOU, SIR. YOU ARE TO GO TO SUITE 317, PLEASE. THANK YOU. WILL YOU GET SOMEBODY TO GET MY BAGS? VERY GOOD, SIR. MAY I HAVE MY KEY, PLEASE? CERTAINLY. THANK YOU. COME IN. MR. LOGAN, WE'VE BEEN EXPECTING YOU. SAM'S HERE. WHERE IS HE? HE'LL SEE YOU LATER DOWNSTAIRS. HE'S IN WITH CHRISTINE. IT SEEMS YOU LET HER CATCH A SEVERE CHILL. LUCKILY, SHE HAD THE GOOD SENSE TO CALL ME FROM OLYMPIA THIS MORNING AND HAVE ME BRING HER HERE. SHE WANTED SAM TO TAKE HER HOME TO AMERICA TONIGHT. MRS. GELLERT, WHAT ARE YOU UP TO? UP TO? I'M NOT UP TO ANYTHING. IT'S SIMPLY THIS: I KNOW MY DAUGHTER. TAKE MY ADVICE, MR. LOGAN. FORGET ABOUT HER. YOU WOULDN'T BE ANY USE TO HER. WHAT SHE NEEDS IS EXACTLY WHAT'S SHE'S GOT: A SLAVE LIKE SAM! [DOOR CLOSES] MURRAY. OH, SAM. I'VE ONLY GOT A COUPLE OF MINUTES, FELLA. THE DOCTOR JUST LEFT, AND I DON'T WANT HER TO BE BY HERSELF. WHAT DID HE SAY? WELL, DOCTORS ARE DOCTORS THE WORLD OVER-- ALWAYS SMILING, ALWAYS CHEERFUL. WELL, I GUESS I'LL HAVE A DRINK. NO, I BETTER NOT. I DON'T REALLY WANT ONE, AND SHE MIGHT NEED ME. SHE'S, UM, RUNNING A FEVER-- 103. LOOK, UH, MURRAY, I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW HOW SORRY I AM ABOUT SYBIL AND THE WHOLE MESS. I NEVER READ SUCH ROTTEN LIES IN MY LIFE. WELL, I BETTER GET BACK UPSTAIRS. NONE OF THAT'S IMPORTANT NOW. WE'LL TALK LATER, FELLA. I'LL GIVE YOU A RING. ALL RIGHT. [RINGING] YES. I HAD ANOTHER MAN CHECK HER. WELL, THEY BROUGHT HER HERE. IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S DEVELOPING INTO PNEUMONIA. WELL, WE'LL JUST HAVE TO KEEP OUR FINGERS CROSSED, FELLA. THAT'S ALL WE CAN DO. I'D RATHER YOU DIDN'T. UM, LISTEN, UH, THEY WANT TO TALK TO ME. I'LL KEEP YOU POSTED. [TELEPHONE RINGS] HELLO? MR. BONNER JUST TELEPHONED FROM THE HOSPITAL. HE WISHES YOU TO COME AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. YES. I'M LOOKING FOR MR. BONNER. MR. BONNER'S IN THE WAITING ROOM OVER THERE. SAM? HOW IS SHE? SHE ISN'T EVEN PUTTING UP A FIGHT. I GOT THE BEST DAMN DOCTORS IN THE COUNTRY ON THE CASE, AND THEY CAN'T DO A THING-- NOT A THING. SHE USED TO FIGHT BACK, BUT NOT THIS TIME-- NOT NOW. I CAN'T GET THROUGH TO HER AT ALL. SHE ASKED TO SEE YOU. I'LL SHOW YOU HOW TO GET THERE. WHEN CHRISTINE WAS DELIRIOUS, SHE TALKED ABOUT YOU. I'D GO AWAY SO AS NOT TO HEAR. SHE THOUGHT YOU WERE WITH HER. SHE KEPT CALLING YOUR NAME. I NEVER FLATTERED MYSELF THAT CHRISTINE LOVED ME, BUT I LOVED HER SO MUCH IT DIDN'T MATTER MOST OF THE TIME. THIRD. IF I'D EVER STOPPED TO THINK THINGS OUT, I'M SURE I'D HAVE GUESSED THAT SHE'D HAVE TO LOVE SOMEONE SOMEDAY. WELL, IT HAPPENED TO BE YOU. I DON'T THINK CHRISTINE WOULD HAVE LEFT ME BECAUSE OF IT, SO I DON'T HOLD THAT AGAINST YOU. BUT WHY IN GOD'S NAME COULDN'T YOU HAVE LOOKED AFTER HER PROPERLY? MOTHER SPOKE TO THAT SYRIAN DOCTOR UP IN DELPHI. SAID THAT HE WARNED YOU ABOUT THE ROAD AND HOW DANGEROUS IT WOULD BE FOR HER. WHY DIDN'T YOU LISTEN TO HIM? WHY THE HELL DID YOU TAKE THE CHANCE? SAM, I'VE BEEN MEANING-- OH, WHAT'S THE GOOD OF TALKING? IT'S DONE--FINISHED. NOTHING'S GOING TO BRING HER BACK NOW. BUT IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR YOU, I WOULDN'T HAVE LOST HER. THAT'S SOMETHING I'LL NEVER FORGIVE YOU FOR. NURSE, THIS IS MR. LOGAN. [AIR HISSING] [HISSING STOPS] [WHISPERING] Murray. I didn't... I DIDN'T WANT YOU TO... HAVE TO GO THROUGH THIS... EVER. I HATE HAVING... YOU SEE ME LIKE THIS. Christine. NO. NO, MURRAY. DON'T BLAME YOURSELF... FOR ANYTHING. I WANTED LIFE. I FOUND IT. MURRAY, DO... WHAT WE WOULD HAVE DONE TOGETHER... WILL YOU? WILL YOU, MURRAY? YES. IS ONE HAPPIER, DO YOU THINK, WITH 10 YEARS OF HAPPINESS THAN IF ONE HAS 10 MINUTES OR 10 DAYS? I DON'T KNOW. I'VE NEVER HAD THE 10 YEARS. BECAUSE I'VE NEVER BEEN HAPPIER IN MY WHOLE LIFE. ME, TOO. IT MUST BE LIKE THIS ON YOUR ISLAND. CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY TURNER ENTERTAINMENT GROUP AND U.S. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION
