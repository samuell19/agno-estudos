So that today you guys shouldn't feel bored... I will tell you guys a story. You guys should listen to it carefully. Tell us my lord. His name is Rangappa. When no water comes to the house... The ladies will remember him. To many womens he has given his water. -What? Don't misunderstand. He is the incharge for water in the Water board. Then she is... ..Lakshmi. She's the only wife of Rangappa. To get an heir... What they used to do is... Frequently in bedroom... They used to switch off the lights. The yield of their labor... Is the Son. What is his name? Ah..! His name is Santu. Alias Muttu. Hey listen... Santu is fine. Won't to ask why he's called muttu? Tell us my lord. While everyone is playing in the mud. He has the habit of kissing. while every child goes to school to study. He used to go to school to kiss. Everyday neighboring womens... They used to cook quarrel Do you know why? He used to injure the cheeks of the girls by kissing. So a lot of angry quarrels All the womens used to say if the child is like this... They used to question his father character too. Even while this seriously pestered his father. He used to keep quiet as he will come handy one fine day. But this Santhosh. He took this as an advantage. In his seventh grade. He proposed a girl for marriage. Then she complained this to principal. Then Santu father came running... He asked Aye, why did you do this? He didn't kept quiet. He asked is it wrong to love? You can love and marry. Shouldn't i get married? He asked his father. Then his father... He thought that if this continues then he will get ruined. He bashed him badly and seared him with a hot metal rod. Since that day by seeing that seared skin... He got immensly scared... Then kicked out the thought of girls. Once he got into teenage, was he still in the same state of mind? Aye, keep quiet till i narrate it. Else i will thrash you. Listen to me carefully. Now the son became teen... His father thought that his son is changed. But he is a jerk. His age factor Couldn't stop him He is a damn pain in the neck. Hormones are acting. He is a major too.

Hey please don't cry. Sir be quiet don't console her. These women just cribs for everything. Let it be sir, even cribs when we talk to our own family. They cribs if we don't talk to their family too.

To whom you are calling as dumb eh, if i thrash you will you understand the reality. Get lost. Sir you please leave. -Alright i will leave now-- Due to you i have to listen to random peoples.

Alright proceed, let you get a good guy. Preist sir. -Yes. -Do it well and loud. "Which kingdom king he is who came to take me?" "I lost in his gaze. O lord Rama." "He's so handsome, don't know which life's bond is this?" "Took the seven steps and sitting O lord Rama." "I will follow him." "A lot of girls has proposed him." "I will watch him hidden." "You wish to become his queen." "What kind of attraction is this?" "Why my heartbeat quickened?" "I feel like he's Krishna and I'm his Radhe." "Make him marry me O lord Rama." "O lord Rama alas O lord Rama." "Which kingdom king he is who came to take me?" "I lost in his gaze. O lord Rama." "O krishna love me." "O Rama krishna love me krishna." "He never dwindled nor he fell for anyone." "I got crazy by watching him." "Everything is ruined." "You can stay right, can come a bit closer right?" "I will not ask for kisses." "If you give then too it's not an issue." "Everyone say that we are made for each other." "He is not getting it." "Daily dreams are pleasurable." "I'm your goddess laxmi and you are my lord Rangaswamy." "Please bless him the wisdom O lord Rama." "O lord Rama alas O lord Rama." "Which kingdom king he is who came to take me?" "I lost in his gaze. O lord Rama." "O lord Rama alas O lord Rama." Aye stop it. [singing happy birthday song] I thought that today's will be an armageddon. I saw you in the car. Moreover you were sobbing by watching those guys, were those your relatives? -I remembered my parents. -Why what happened? What's your story? In everyone's life... -Hm-hmm. Childhood is a part. There will a lot of joyful memories to cherish. But in my life it's all horrible memories. My family consist of Dad, Mom and me. We had a lovely family. My father was always travelled abroad for business trips. Me and my father were in the home. Mom always played with me like a child. One day while we were playing. A red juice flowed from my mom mouth. I got scared and asked her what is it? She replied don't worry it's just a tomato sauce. I said mom i don't like this game, let's play something else. She said alright let's play another game then. Till date i was mother and you were the daughter... She asked that you become the mother and shall i become the daughter? I got pretty excited. She asked mother i feet parched, Can you give me some water? I said is it dear wait i will get it for you and got the water for her. She asked mother I'm feeling sleepy shall i sleep on your lap? I got her sleep on my lap and sang lullabies. She slept by listening to it. I was awaiting for her to wake up but she didn't woke up. Mummy get up. Mom! Mom. [sobs] Mummy..! My mother passed away on my lap. After couple of days i found out. The thing that was coming out of my mother mouth was... Not tomato sauce. But blood. Blood cancer just killed her. After that... To provide me a mother my dad remarried again. My step mom was not a good wife to my father nor a good mother to me. One day i was suffering from an extreme stomach ache. When i went and told her about this... you might had ate something, go have the medicine and take rest. Everything will be fine. Always some or the other issue with her. 'I had slept in that pain.' Morning i got to know after the maid came that... My stomach is aching. '..I attained maturity.' Being a woman... ..She didn't cared for me. Madam Aish got matured. -What shall i do for it? Have i given birth to her? You take care of her. I miss you mom. That day i understood... The value of a mother. When my father was not in town... My stepmom friends used to come to home and party. In that a demon used to give me imported chocolates and made me sit on his lap and molest my body. I was just a small girl. I didn't understood anything of it. Even when i grown up he didn't left me. He pampered me with his words and assualted me sexually... ..As a wild animal. My father found out about it and then it was a hell of a fight. Then we came to Bangalore... Then it was all going well. One day my father asked me "What shall i get it from US?" Dad when will you take me in the flight? He said that's it dear, i will take you around the globe. Next day i got a call. Your father died in a plane crash. God has... ..Snatched my father too. I had become alone. Today to listen to my pain there is no mother... No father to say don't worry daughter I'm here with you. Why am i telling you all of this..? Tomorrow is the 45th day. I don't know if you will be with me or not. I will go and sleep. Bye. Santhu you came, good. Tomorrow the 45 days bad luck will clear out. Your wife family is coming to fix the marriage date. Alright mom fix it. "Are every one in love are crazy?" "O god..O god." "They hide the pain and smile." "What they say is different than the actual emotions." "Is sacrifice the true love." Pregnency test right, rather than rapid test it's better to go for a blood test for proper result. Sister please collect her blood sample. Okay doctor. You will get the report in four hours. I will mail you out, you may leave. Madam just now both went out right, what's the issue? They came for the pregnancy test. I will invite every relative... I will gift everyone the cloth. Yes man-- -Tell them to bring their elders too. Get all the elders of your family. 'Aye Rangappa...' Look someone at the door. 'Aye come out.' He will come on horse. Aye Rangappa, come out. Come out. Brother please come in. What happened Shari why are you crying? I will not come. Call your husband. Tell me what happened-- -Call your husband, Aye Rangappa. Come here. Someone came wait. Why the hell is he screaming like this? Atleast tell me brother what happened? -Come here. -Hey sir. Why are you standing here? Please come in. Where to come? Is this the home or funeral? Look man. -Huh. I have seen women making the men crazy. But for the first i have seen men making an women crazy. About whom are you talking? I'm talking about your son, call him out. What happened? What did he do? -What he did, eh? After your son confirmed his approval to marry my daughter... He is maintaining a family with another one. He impregnated her and took her to the hospital. Let's discuss this inside. Leave my hand man, i said leave my hand. Leave my hand i say. Step away. Stand away. Let an entire village know about your son. Let the people know his actions. I was under the impression that he's my son-in-law... But he was about to ruin my daughter life. God is great that he postponed the marriage. I thought him a good person and will take care of my daughter... He impregnated other girls and ruined the life of her that bloddy fella. Shame on him. Did we came to your home offering our daughter? You came to us right. We give birth,raise,educate and do everything in power to arrange her marriage. Do you know why? Because the husband will take a good care of her. But if the husband is running behind another girl then tell us what should we do? You will never flourish, the curse of a mother will not leave you. You will be damned. Giving birth to a child is not enough, You have to raise him well too. Lift your head..Lift your head. You have to teach 'em ethics. How will you teach him when you don't have it? Damn your life. O god, You ruined the happiness of my pure lovely granddaughter. You will never be happy, you will be doomed. Talking to these bloddy fools is just a waste of time, hop onto the car. let's go mother-in-law. You will be doomed for sure. just wait and watch. What the hell is this? Dad..! I'm his father. -Huh! Dad. Please sit down. -Son... I haven't came here to sit and discuss your wellbeing. What kind of damn person are you? Why have you born to us? Why have you born to us? Who is she? Minchu is finished. Minchu chapter is closed. Finished. They came to our home disrespected us like anything. They have ruined all our respect They made us to bow our heads in front of the society. If you would have said that I love this girl then i would had married you to her. Dad-- -Aye. -Don't call me the dad. What do you think the meaning of father? Father is the one who give you the life. Father is like that. Aye... I became the son then became the father I haven't did anything that will make my father to lose his respect. I haven't done. I never scared of punishment nor attack. Do you know why i got scared of that fellow? Why-- I got scared because of the respect. Parents will easily bear even if the child leave the religion. But if that child gets a question on his character then how should one bear? If a child is doing such a disrespectful act then what should a parent do? What-- Look... You too are a women right? Is't it? You don't know anything about him... How will you live with him Eh? Husband wife relationship is not mere a relationship. It's a holy tie. We came from the culture where we used to see mother in the wife. This dating,crush,living together is all crap. Gross. Understand this. IF you lose your credibility under the effect of this age. You will ruin your life. If you guys want to unite then there should be couple of process to be followed. It's not just pillows and beds. An ethical living is called a family. This way of living is not called family. It's called unethical taboo. Aye... Rather than the examples of parents killing their child due to mistakes. There are tons of examples of parents killings themselves. The pain that your mother experienced when you were in her womb. Now she is experiencing ten times more pain than that. Do you know what is a mother? Do you know? Why..? Rather than giving so much pain to your parents... Poision us and kill us once and for all. Rather than dying daily, we will die at once. Son... I'm begging you. Hence our relationship is finished. Assume that we are dead to you. You will not get the parents value now. When you become the parents... Then you will get it. The pain of parents. You both will experience the pain that you guys have caused us. You both will experience it. Go away. Aishu..Aishu..Aishu.. Aishu-- -Please leave me alone. Aye Santhosha... Damn Santhosha, come down. What are you watching by standing there? Come down. Come.. Come damnit. Look how he's coming? Minchu what's this? Aye Santhosha... You have ruined all of my life happiness. Did i asked you to come and marry me? Huh? You came right? You hugged me and accepted me. You given birth to all the wishes and dreams in my heart. Aye Kavya, you told me to change for him. Damn fellow. You have changed me entirely. The one who used to drink milk... Made to drink alcohol. My granny used to tell me to pray to get the husband with a golden heart. But you crap! Damn you-- -Minchu listen to me. Don't touch me. Aye. What is less in me? Isn't there a beauty or cuteness? What's there in her that's not in me? As special. Eh? You will not live well. No good will happen to you. Even if the god forgives you. I will not forgive you. I hate you. I hate you. Aishu... Aishu... Brother. Sister told me to give this letter to you. Sorry Santu. I'm writing this letter because i didn't have the courage to tell my hearts pain. You got into so many problems due to me. I tortured you pestered you. I snatched your peace. Do you know why because i like you a lot. You took me to the lodge and in home safely. I understood that you really are a good person. After i got you i felt to live spend every moment with you. Because i was afraid that you will leave me. I planned this pregnancy and 45 days act. On that day nothing happened between us, entirely different thing happened on that day. You were sleeping on the floor after heavy booze. I took you to the bed. Thanks dear that you cared for me as a friend and mother. I will never forget that in my whole life. I will live with those memories of you till my last breath. Parents love is the biggest love in this world. I became the reason for you to lose it. Please forgive me. Go and live with her happily. Santhu i miss you. I feel more pain that i have cheated you rather than leaving you. Bye. Forgive me please. I did the mistake Aishu, you told me what's in your heart. But i didn't tried to figure out what's in my heart. Do you know what i had prayed to the god? Dear God? Who is Aishu Don't know why she came in my life. I was afraid of she's being close with me But today I'm afraid of that she will be leaving me. I doesn't aware of her Eventhough I'm in love with her After 45th day i wanted to be with her for whole life Look I'm begging you By tomorrow she must get postive in pregancy report Please God! "O god..O god." "Are every one in love are crazy?" "O god..O god." "They hide the pain and smile." "What they say is different than the actual emotions." "Is sacrifice the true love." "Please forgive me." "Please somehow hate me." "The face with a gentle smile." "It's just a fake act." "Heart full of deadly pain." "Please forgive me." "Please somehow hate me." "O god..O god." "Are every one in love are crazy?" "O god..O god." "They hide the pain and smile." "What they say is different than the actual emotions." "Is sacrifice the true love." "I can't push you, somehow you go away from me." "I can't see you and can't lose you again." "Don't meet in the path." "Don't smile when you meet me." "The face with a gentle smile." "It's just a fake act." "Heart full of deadly pain." "Please forgive me." "Please somehow hate me." "O god..O god." "Are every one in love are crazy?" "O god..O god." "They hide the pain and smile." "What they say is different than the actual emotions." "Is sacrifice the true love." Hey son... What is it dear? What is this? What happened is happened. Is it sensible enough to keep on scratching on that? Look dear. If you ruin your life by thinking about the people who left you, will lead you to lose the ones who are with you. For parents the happiness of their child is the utmost importance. Parents will forget the life of their own once a child is born. Yes dear. For us the happiness of our child is important. Yes. In life it's common to have a lot of troubles. We have to face those and move on. Then you will find a new life and a new way. Don't think too much, go and take rest. This love is a kind of lesson and game too for the ones of your age. What you had lost is just a flip toss. You haven't lost the real game. You haven't lost. Childrens shouldn't lose. If a child lose then it's like the parents lost. You shouldn't lose dear. You should win. In life you have to win. Warm welcome to ladies and gentlemen. We are here to celebrate the tenth anniversary of Rashmi infotech. Enjoy. I request our CEO Mr. Mahaling to kickstart the party by opening the champagne. Yo... Even the sadness of death gets smudgeoff after eleven days... Even after three months the love failure is glooming on your face. You are still living in her memories, just let it go pal. Dude let me tell you one thing, there is no less booze nor girls in the city. You just have to get one. Swear on my mother that this is first thing you told on your own. -Isn't it? -Yes. Yo if this girl is not the one then-- Go and enjoy. Another girl, why do you worry under the heaven. Tell me, eh? Aye. -Huh. Shall i tell you one thing? You guys are just like pests in Santhosh life. Bloody fellows... He is trying to forget everything but you guys just making it much tough for him to forget. The same thing happened to me too, where ever i see i see Aishwarya. Even to me too feels like she's walking towards us. What is there to feel? She's the one coming. Where did you left leaving me Aishu? Santu. I'm feeling so happy seeing you. Ah, Santhosh. Preetam... Preetam... Yeah Yeah i will call you later. Sorry i was on a call. No problem. This is Preetam my fiance. Hi. I used to tell you right about my best friend Santhosh, he is him. Oh... -Nice meeting you. Aishwarya told more about you than her. So she got me here to give you the first wedding invitation card to you. Take it, please come. Santhu don't miss it. Your bestie's marrige. You should stand and commission the marriage. Yeah. -Yes. Ah, Give me two minutes i will come. Yeah sure. I'm sorry Santhu..! Don't think that I'm hurting you by coming again. I very well know that you are hurting a lot without me. I thought you might have forgotten me... I didn't think that you will be waiting for me for the love you have for me. Bhagya told me everything. I felt so joyful after i found out that you love me. But... I have no luck of making you mine. I'm getting married to make you forget me permanently. Please rip me out from your heart. Forget me. Please. Forgive me. You have to live well Santhu. You have to live happily. Drink, drink well. Pour yourself more. You are joyful now right, you have to live happily right? I never thought that you will do this to me. Because I'm drinking alone without you right? Come take a seat. Are you kidding? [sharp exhale] Your arrival made my heart glee like i felt during the end of lockdown. Apply sanitizer. I very well knew that you will come. What should i do without being back? what the hell did you say to him? -Huh... You given me an invitation... As Preetham weds Aishwarya... Do you think that i will attend your wedding and dine happily. When you ran into the toilet wihtout seeing me in the eye. I thought of coming behind you and give you a tight slap. Amid of that the god blessed me with an idea. So in that i played my game. So Santhu how's the life going on? Why you have gone silent? We are not leaving Bangalore. Oh because your best friend is leaving you. Who's the best friend? Er, Aishwarya. Come here. She's not my friend. -Then? She's my lover. Lover! what are you saying? I'm loving her and she's loving me too. If you come between us... What will you do if i come? Sir..Sir please sir, i beg you. -What are you doing-- -Sir please don't separate us. You look a hero why you are trying to become villian? Please leave my girl sir-- Aye, get up man. Ay he's a good man dude, he will defintely leave her. That too they lived together for 45 days in a single house. Something might had happened right? Definitely something might had happened. She had become pregnant too right. She had pregnant too?! Pregnant?! That got aborted? Yes that got aborted. If you don't mind shall i tell you one thing? If i assume yours is mine that you will feel bad. If you assume what's mine is your then i will feel bad. IF you assume his is yours then he will feel bad and we too. So, his girl should be with him right. If you unite Santhosh and Aishwarya then we all will feel good. -[in unison] Please sir. Please sir why are you marrying another persons wife? Huh! You are a damn cheater, do you know what he told me? How do i know? You tell me. Preetham why have you brought me here? -Because i wanted to talk to you. -Tell me. Do you know what your best friend Santhosh told me about you? -What did he say? He complained on you. -Means... Means you are... Um... He said good things about you that you are a kind lady a honest person. But he told anothing thing after that. -What? Sir don't give her more than two pegs else she will thrash you. Then Aishwarya... Shall i ask you a question? Yes ask me. I never loved because i wanted to achieve my dream. But be honest with me... Haven't you loved anyone? -Huh! -Nope. -Is it? No, i haven't loved anyone. If we don't have the clarity about our goals... There will be confusions in our path. We can't enjoy. You are lying to me. But your eyes are telling the truth. Santhosh is really nice person. He told the truth to save his love. Am i the only one scapegoat that you have found? By cheating him and me... More than that you are cheating yourself. How will you marry and live with another person when your heart is with someone else? You can act happy by keeping Santhosh in your heart. But you cannot live peacefully. If we both marry then we can be husband and wife in the society. But we can't he happy. But if you marry the person you love. Then you will happy throughout life. Before getting into a relationship with a boy think hundred times. But if you guys blossom the dreams in his heart and then leave him. Then what the boys should do? Are you consider this a big sacrifice? If you plan to sacrifice the love then it might be a boy or a girl don't get into the relationship. If you love once then no matter the troubles decide onto living together throughout the life. Love haven't cheated anyone. You too don't cheat the love. Santhosh might be waiting for you, go and save your love. Um, What..? Are you wondering what about me? I will not become a celibate, If i find a girl beside the name Preetham in the wedding card. I will primarily give the card to both of you. Go... All the best. [laughs] He said well... He's the damn macho chap. When it comes to the matter of love we boys always support it. Thank you brother. How was my bowling? In a single ball two wickets fell. This is cheating, what you had done is wrong. I hate you. Hey... Aishu. Aishu. Aishu wait. Aishu. Was i wrong to tell the truth because i wanted my girl to live with me. You are marrying someone else by loving me right? How did you got the heart to do it? Building a house with one and entering the house with another,eh? Please Santhu, understand it. I am not the right person for you. Who told you? -Your father. -Look... My dad agreed to it, everything is sorted out. No Santhu i have pestered you a lot. I like that pestering. I'm not a good, i booze daily. Drink, but not infront of my father. This will not work out Santhu, leave me. Aishu... Please don't pester me again. I love you. I have hidden one more thing from you. What? Do you know i haven't drank since 3 months. Just now you drank right? That you made me drink it. I love you. My son is settled. The one who lit the fire on heaven is the wise one. Aye... Why are you taking two coconut water daily? Is there an issue? -Yes father. Come and have a peg with me everything will be fine. Ah, dad... I can't bear the smell of it. Is it? then go son. I can't bear too but your mother makes me to. Father-in-law i made hot cauliflower fritters for you, It will be best with it. Have it. I feel joyful seeing your guys chemistry. Thank you father-in-law. Dear daughter. -Hm.
