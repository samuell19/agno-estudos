God bless America! We made it back! Times Square, believe me, is wall-to-wall people bent on having the greatest party ever and being in on a bit of this history. What a night this is! What a thrill! Our boys are coming home and a lot of them are here right now. I talked with boys from Arkansas, Colorado, Seattle, Washington, Los Angeles, Aberdeen, Washington. Looking around Times Square, people are delirious. They're holding up newspapers with huge headlines. "V-J Day," it says. "War's end. It's over." They're hugging and kissing, shouting and cheering, and paper by the ton keeps flowing out of the windows high above them. Pennsylvania six-five-thousand! The USO shows too. Our hats are off to all those in show business who traveled the world, entertaining our men and women. Times Square is happy, New York is happy, the US is happy and the world is at peace. Tommy, I know America wants to thank you and your organization for all the great war-bond drives you put on and for that wonderful radio show, the Treasury Star Parade. It's been a pleasure doing our musical bit. Well, we all loved it. - Swinging band. - Yeah. Swinging band, man. Really jumps. You here by yourself? - No. - Who are you with? - My boyfriend. - Oh. Can I get in touch anyway? Hey. I know you from some place. We met a few years ago at a party. We really liked each other. I want to see you again. My mother and father are down there. Jimmy! Jimmy! Hey! Catch you later, right? - Hey, where've you been? - Where's your uniform? - Threw it out the goddamn window! - Look at those! - Did you jump some Hawaiian? - I won these in a card game. This guy had three deuces but I had three threes. - Three threes? Three threes? - Three threes. - Card game, huh? - Card game. Jackpot! Jackpot! Glad to have you back, boys. - I know you from some place. - No. - You don't remember me? - No. We met a few years ago at a party or a dance. - You can't remember that? - No. I want to explain, my parents are over there, so I've got to see them because I just was two years in the service. I want to get your phone number so I can tell you tomorrow something very important. - No. - No what? - No what? - No. - No, you don't understand. - No. - Give me your number. Got a pencil? - No. All right, just tell me. I'll remember it. - No. - Yes. - No. - Can I meet you at Central Park? - I'm serious. - I know. No. - I mean, come on, there's no way... - No. - That seat's taken. - I'm figuring out another angle. Skip it. I've heard every angle tonight. - Yeah? - Yeah. This one? That's a swinging... - ...band. - ...band. I don't mean to be rude, but I do have friends and they are coming back. - Just leave. - When they come back. - Why not now? - Then I'll never get to know you, how wonderful you are. I'm serious, even though I'm giving you a line. - I'm serious. I know you know that. - I know that. From the deepest part of my heart, which is not too deep. Why don't you just go someplace else and try it again? All right, I'll... Pardon me. Was that fellow in the Hawaiian shirt disturbing you? - I know him. He's crazy. - Not crazy, just pushy. You know what he said about you? - What? - Nothing. Stop it. Look... All right. Enough! Look, I'm going to get serious. When I saw you, I realized I fought this war for a reason. When I was in my foxhole, not knowing whether I'd live or die, in the mud and dirty, I didn't know anything. All right? I'll take only a minute of your time. Now, when I walked in there, I knew. - I knew. - You knew what? That I wouldn't get anywhere at this table. Now I'm impressed. I guess a little small talk is in order. - Can it get any smaller? - I can take a hint. Can you take a walk? - Shall I leave? - Yes! - I'll leave right now. - Bye. You expect me to leave after that? - Will you go away? - I don't want to. I want to stay here and annoy you. Go away! Look, let's get down to business. It's getting a little tiring here. Give me your phone number and we'll avoid this. - Why not avoid it anyway? - What's to be avoided? - You. - That cannot be avoided. If you had one ounce of a gentleman in you, you'd go away. - Well, I'm not a gentleman. - That explains everything. Do I look like a gentleman in this shirt and these pants? Well... - Even a louse would go away. - Just give me the number. - What am I going to do with it? - Call it. Please. Look, I give up. I give up. I'll take a rain check. - Maybe next war. - You think you'll win it? - Evans! - Friend of yours is calling you. Remember me? Paul's friend. - Troy? - Arnold. Oh, Arnold, I'm sorry. - I'm sorry. - Ray Bolger's show, USO. Evans, you should have come with us to London. We had a great time. - You're beautiful. - Thank you. How's Paul? He's here. I just saw him. - He's here? - Yeah. - Where? - Paul! Hey, Paul, look who's here! Francine. Hi, Paul! Remember me? I'll call you tomorrow, right? Keep on plugging, Francine. Don't ever change. You're beautiful. Don't ever change, Francine. You're beautiful. Francine, meet my new monkey. Eddie Di Maggio. - Di Muzio. - Only you don't look like a Di Muzio. - You don't look like... - Oh, but he's a terrific dancer. He dips and everything, don't you, honey? Have fun, Francine. Thank you! Tommy Dorsey and the orchestra. Right after the pause, we're going to switch you to ballroom. - Where have you been? - We're over there. The guys are waiting for you. - Where are the broads? - There. - Are you using your room tonight? - Of course I'm using my room. - You want to use the room? - Yeah. I fell in love half an hour ago. I think she's a professional dancer. She's got some pair of legs. - How long are you gonna be? - Maybe an hour. - All right. Use the bathroom. - OK. Why didn't you bring them to the table? There's only two. - One for me, one for you. - OK. - Are these the girls? - Yeah, why? - Right here? - Yeah. - Which one is yours? - The blonde. - So I have the brunette? - Right. She's a pain in the ass. I spent 20 minutes giving her every routine I knew. It didn't work. There was nothing. - The one over there? - Yeah. That one, the W¤C. Maybe the other one will go. You got the good one, I got the bad one. - I don't understand... - It's V-J Day. I want to get laid. What's happening here? Oh, look at her now! Look at that. Look how cocky she is. You know what I'm going to do? Go over and tell her I was wounded in action. I just got out of the hospital and I'm shy and nervous. Tell her I'm sensitive. Lay it on like I'm a war hero. - OK. - Not too heavy. Indirect. I'll wait over here and then I'll come over. Lay it on real well, because I want to get her. - Leave this to me, OK? - All right. Wait, wait! All right, OK. - Wait, wait. - What is it? - Tell me what you're going to do. - Leave it up to me. Take it easy. What about the other thing? Sensitive. - Sensitive. Sensitive. - Oh, sensitive. Oh, right. OK. - Wait. What am I doing? - What? For her I'm doing all this? I'm going with you. Just introduce me. Francine Flannery, Jimmy Doyle. - Pleased to meet you. - Ellen Evans. Wrong. I'm Francine Evans, this is Ellen Flannery. - Remember her? You've been dancing. - Let's go. He's such an animal. - Be careful! - I'll be right back. Mind if I sit down now? After all, we've been formally introduced now. We're old friends. If you and I had danced, it might have been a nice time. I just gave my hotel key to my friend because he's found someone he's hooked on. - That's very generous. - Yeah, I thought so. It seems you give things away easily, huh? - Did you have something in mind? - For what? For what you just said before. Meaning would I give anything of myself easily to you, which I could do very easily. He'll only be there for an hour or two. Got any Juicy Fruit? Sure. Bye-bye. I'll get her. Eddie, if nothing happened after four hours, why in the next hour? I'm gonna be there in one hour. That's it. Bye. I'm sure it's Doyle. I'm sorry, there's no Doyle registered here. A friend of mine is in that room with a friend of his. Ellen Flannery. It's quite urgent that I get a hold of her. - Can't you just look one more time? - Sure. She's afraid of heights. If it's too high and she gets dizzy, it might be awful for your hotel. Naturally. Excuse me. Just a second. Mr. Powell? - That's him. Mr. Doyle! - Mr. Powell! - Mr. Doyle! - Mr. Powell! Which is he? Mr. Doyle. Jimmy Doyle! I'd like to talk to you for a second, please. Step right over. - Is there a problem? - Only a minute. - Where's Ellen? - Fancy meeting you here! Boy, you're a winner. Every time l run into you, you cause me problems. - What are you talking about? - You just ruined it for me. He's calling the manager because I'm here under an alias. We're all going to get arrested. You'll have to get my suitcase and sax because I have an audition now. If you mess that up, I'm going to get even with you. I don't care how, but I am going to. You ruined it. - Mr. Powell? - Get up there now! I'm having a talk with my sister. Do you mind? - Yes, I do. - Well, you'll have to wait. Sis... Oh, please, Sis! Now, Mommy's waiting. She was worried for a few days... Mr. Powell, please. You've run up quite a bill with us. - Where were you before coming here? - Where was l? - That's right. - Where were you? Because you know where I was? I was in Anzio! Anzio! I remember it now. - Fine, Mr. Powell. - Wait, I get carried away. Sorry. Five nights at the Commodore, three at the St. Regis, room service at each. In one case, use of the limousine. Why do you switch hotels so often? How could I even sign these checks? - These are your signatures. - My signature hand doesn't work. There's no life in that arm. I might have it amputated tomorrow. Do I sign with my left hand? I'm right-handed. Look at that signature. Your sister will know your signature, sir. - Is that my signature? - Yes. - Come on. - That's your sister. - That's not my signature. - Yes, it is. She's wacky. You know, in the W¤Cs. - Yes. - Sister, you've got to go home. - No! - 11 West 55th Street. - No! I'm not going to do this. - Go home now! - All right! - Remember Anzio. No, no. It's this way. And right away. - And I'll meet you later. - Mr. Powell... This is harassment. I'm not coming to this hotel. - I'm going to complain to the manager. - Would you lower your voice? I think you have a lot of nerve. You see when that happens, you can't explain why. - You see my leg. It's wood. - That's terrible. It's the best kind of wood, but it's a wooden leg. I lost this leg so you could accuse me of not paying hotel bills. I can't believe this! Would you push it off, please? - Ellen! Honey, are you all right? - I'm just great. - Any last words? - She... - Sorry, did I scare you? - No. Good luck. I've had her for three years. She's had every germ known to man, Di Maggio. - Di Muzio. - Is this Jimmy's? Can't you take a joke? Well, take good care of her. - What germs are you talking about? - Killers. - This cab is... - Excuse me, I need... Forgotten but not gone. - 242... - Hotel Alcott, please. Just a second. 2842 Flatbush Avenue, Brooklyn. - Do you mind if I take this cab? - Do I have a choice? No. I have an audition. Do you? I'm late for it. Come along. You have nothing better to do, anyway. - I was thinking of doing my nails. - Brooklyn, or what? I just said. It's going to be Brooklyn. 2482 Flatbush Avenue. 2842 Flatbush Avenue. Same thing. What about your nails? Why don't you do them? Why are you so serious? Come on, loosen up. Come on. You gave me a hard time last night. Loosen up a little bit. Oh, come, come. Let's have some gum. Best way to keep your mouth shut and keep you occupied. No, thank you. - You're enjoying this ride. - I'm having a hell of a time. I'm nervous because of this audition. It's good to chew. It relaxes me. God, I'm so nervous about this. You make it worse. - What did you say your name was? - I didn't say. - You didn't say? - No. - Would you do me a favor? - What? - Would you hold something for me? - What? - Give me your hand. For good luck. - For good luck? Ooh, that's very funny! You've got a good sense of humor, kid. Oh, I can't believe it. I want to ask you something. You want to know what interests me the most, Frances? One is music, number two is money and number three is... I got it. Uh-huh. Got it. - What's the matter? - I don't want it. - Are they always in that order? - Sure, unless... ...you come across someone who grooves you and you want to groove with. Say, you. If things work out and you start acting more intelligent, then possibly I'll make number three number one, number one number three and number two... No, wait. Now I'm getting confused. - You put it where... - You put it where number three is. That's... Wait, let me start all over again. Let me get this... - Three would be one... - Then two is three. Exactly. And when you have that, you have what you call a major chord. - What's a major chord? - When everything works out perfectly, when you have everything you want. The woman you want, the music you want and enough money to live comfortably. That's a major chord. Huh. One, two, three, four. That's enough, Doyle. Hold! Doyle! - What? - I've got a hangover. That's loud. Loud? What do you mean? You didn't dig those sounds? You didn't even let me finish the chorus. Jimmy... Jimmy, could I talk to you just for a minute? Excuse me. I'll just be a sec. You're playing terrific, but play a little smoother, like a ballad. - This guy's got that kind of attitude. - Yeah, yeah. The whole joint screams... Are you my agent? Want ten percent? Huh? Sit over there. I said when we came to sit over there. Now sit over there. See what you did? Come here! Come here. - Don't do that. - We do this all the time. - Don't touch me. - All right. I just wanted to say I'm sorry. I just got annoyed with him. - I put my foot in my mouth. - How about my foot in it? How about putting your horn in it? - That's what we're here for. - Give me a break. - Come here. - Get a load of this guy. - He wants you to go over there. - Come on. Go there, go there. Go ahead. Try and understand my situation, will you? What I've got is a boy singer and an eight-piece polka orchestra. Try Chevalier. The guys coming back from France like that sound. - Chevalier? - Chevalier. - Chevalier. - Yeah. Hey, man, this isn't 1917. You look a little more hip to me than that. - I'd rather get a job at a post office. - Then forget it. - That's what I said. - I said it. - No, I said it. - No, I said it.

I'm getting soaked. Jimmy, why don't you call me tomorrow? - What time? - Noon is fine. OK, I'm going. I'm going now. - Goodnight, Jimmy. - I'll call you tomorrow. - Where to, buddy? - Just a minute. - Oh, Miss Evans! - What? Telephone. It's your agent. He's been calling. - You can take it here. - Thank you. - Tony, it's nice to hear from you. - Yes, sir. May I help you? - I'd like to check in. - Just sign the register. - Do you have any more bags? - Yes, I have one in the cab, if you wouldn't mind waking up the bellhop. Send him outside. I'll pay the bill also and put it on this bill. - That'll be fine. - We'll wake him in a few minutes. I'm sort of ready to go back to work. I'd like a little rest. - Mr. M. Powell... Excuse me, sir. - Hold on a second, Tony. - What are you doing? - Checking in. Why not? I'm going to get blamed when you don't pay the bill. Will you hold on just for a minute? - Anything else, sir? - Yes, some Scotch and vodka. Maybe we can send the bellhop to get it. - We'll put that on the bill. - When he wakes up, we'll send him. All right, Jimmy. Look. Take this. This'll be enough for a room for tonight. Go anyplace else. It's a lot easier if I come up. I'll sleep in the bath. - No. - A lot easier. Please take this. - It's a lot easier. - Just take this, Jimmy. - 12 o'clock? - Yes. Twelve. I promise. - All right. - Suite 415, sir. Forget it. He doesn't even wake up. I'm not interested. Sorry you feel that way, sir. - That's a great suit. - Thank you very much, Miss Evans. Tony. What do you want? Right, Frankie Harte, 7:30 tomorrow morning. No! No! Jimmy! Jimmy! Jimmy! Beautiful, beautiful. - Hey, are you Jimmy Doyle? - Want to play the blues? Are you Jimmy Doyle? - No. - You're the sax player, ain't you? Yes, but I'm not Jimmy Doyle. Can you communicate with Jimmy Doyle, the sax player? It depends. - I have an important missive for him. - A what? A billet-doux. - A billet-doux? - Billy who? I'll elucidate. A tender message from a certain female party. - For me? For him? - Precisely. Take it, Doyle. It's from Francine. She said she had a wonderful time. - Wait, I'll be right back. - Where are you going? - Ain't she coming? - I'm getting her. - Ten minutes or you're fired. - Who cares? Hey, man! Can I talk to you for a minute? - Did you read this letter? - Of course not. - You think I read letters? - Your name is Tony Harwell? That's right. - You're an agent? - Yeah. - You're her agent? - Of course. She says, "Just ask Tony if you need any help. He appreciates talent." - Let me see that. - I can't show you. It's personal. She also said that she's with Frankie Harte's band and there's a possibility of a spot for me. - Possibility. - A possibility? That's right. - You're an agent? - Yes. - Would you be my agent? - No. - Why not? - I'm satisfied with my client list. - You're making a mistake. - I've made lots. I'll make another. - This one's on me. - Where is she? Why should I tell you, if she doesn't tell you? Why do you take the time to come to Brooklyn to give me this if you don't think she cares enough about me to let me know where she is? - Doesn't that make sense to you? - It should, but it don't. They're in Asheville. But don't mention my name. If Frankie asks, I don't know you, I haven't met you. - Where is Asheville? - Where God lost his shoes. Where God lost his shoes. Good answer. Thanks.

I'm going to come up with you. Jimmy, I'll talk to you after the set. - After the set? - After the set. But first I'm going to have a word with him. You're upset because I didn't come to you in person and say goodbye. Right. And another thing: You don't say goodbye to me, I say goodbye to you. In no way do you say goodbye to me. - Oh. Fine. Go ahead and say it. - What? Goodbye. Go ahead. Come here. I see. I just wait until you say "come here." And when you do, I'm supposed to come here. Look. You think I came all the way here to argue with you? Huh? You think I came all the way down here, chased you, to argue with you? - I'm just confused. - By "major chord" I meant you. Sometimes you really are hard to understand. You're hard to understand. Don't change the subject. I love you. I mean, I don't love you, I dig you. I like you a lot. I mean... I wouldn't come all the way here if I didn't, right? Yeah. Oh, Jimmy. - How do you feel about Texarkana? - What do you mean? Frankie said that, if you came down, you could audition. - I could audition? - Yeah. Forget it. I'll play for him. I won't audition. OK. Oh, Jimmy. Jimmy, come on. Jay, it's slippery. We don't want to slide into town. We want to drive in. Leave me alone. I'm napping. - I'm glad I'm working for you. - You should be. You're not the greatest piano player. It's going to be one of those nights. I'm a good musician, man. You are. Coming from me that means nothing. Maybe someday you'll write something for me, too. I am writing something for you. I'm writing this for you. You think I checked out each room? Last time, I wound up in a basement. Why don't you guys zip up? You don't even let me read what you're writing now. Imagine you giving me your first poem. Let's go into the bridge. If you let me read some of that, I'll let you write the lyrics to this. - That's blackmail. - Right. - No, Jimmy. - Come on! Let me see. - I don't want to. It's private. - It's only a poem. - It's for me. - You never let me see what you write. I'm embarrassed. You wrote all this about me? It's all about me? - Most of it. - It's all about me? - Yeah. - Not anybody else. Me. That's right. - Get your shoes on. - Are you all right, honey? I know it's not very good, but... Come on, get them on. - Come on. - I don't know what we're doing now. - Pay me. - We'll be right back. - Pay me now. - No. I want a cab standing by in the middle of nowhere. We'll be back in a second, I think. Are you all right? Want a handkerchief? I got a handkerchief. I had a handkerchief. - You knocked? - Yes, we... Sorry... Are you the Justice of the Peace? - That's right. - I'm sorry about the window. Is there a possibility that we could be married now? We're in a hurry. Please close yourself, honey. - Now? - Yeah. Please. We'll make it worth your while and pay for the glass. Please? Well... I guess... We can arrange it. Come on. - No. Just a minute. - Aren't you sure? - Yeah, just one second. - You're kidding? That was it? - What? - Your proposal? "Get your coat and shoes, let's go!" That was it? - What's wrong with that? - They're not sure. We're sure. What's wrong with that? I guess I thought it was going to be different. It is different. - Anything wrong? - Nothing. - They're not sure. Believe me. - No, I just thought... - What? - I thought it would be different. - It is different! - I know. The kind of different I had in mind was maybe sweet and calm and... It is calm! I'm sorry. Just a little... And pretty, you know. - It's pretty! - You can't say that. - It is pretty. - You can't say it's pretty. I want to marry you! Please, go inside. This is private. Would you wait one second? Did you hear what I said? I want to marry you. OK? What do you want me to do? You want me to kill myself over this, darling? When I say "now," you back up. That's it. Jimmy, l... - Don't back up! Don't move! - Now! No, no! Don't shift, don't do anything. Just stay... Will you please get out from under there? This happens all the time. Will you marry me? I love you. Will you marry me? I don't want anybody else to be with you. I want to be with you. I don't want anybody else to be with you except me. I love you. I love you. Look at me. I love you. I love you, too. Wait... - See, that was terrific. - You liked that? - Yeah, I liked that. - It was a lot better? - Yeah. - Oh, good. No! - You missing a man? - Yeah, Fowler. Did you find him? Caught him in his room with a local chick. - Big deal. So what? - What do you mean? She's 13. The father started shooting out all the lights. The cops have got him now. Jimmy, take over. I've got to bail Fowler out. He's driving me crazy. Could I do a couple of my arrangements? Not tonight. Just play the usual. Come on! There are only four people in the audience. I'm asking you to front for me. Do you have to give me grief? All right. I'm cancelling the rest of the tour. - Again? - What do you mean "again?" This is the... fifth time that you've cancelled. But I really mean it now. Then, I was jiving you. I mean it. I'm going to pack it in. You remember we used to go out and do 80, 85 one-nighters in a row. Yeah. Those joints aren't ballrooms any more. They're parking lots, skating rinks. The theatres are all bombed out. I've thought about letting somebody else front the band, take a piece of the action. I wouldn't have to lift a finger. But only one guy can front this band. I know. Jimmy, right? No. Me. And if I go, the band goes. It's game over. You know that. - Sure you won't have a little taste? - No, you have it. Beautiful. I will. Maybe Jimmy would consider... You said he's good. You think he's good. He's not only good, baby. He blows a barrelful of tenor. - But he's a pain in the ass. - I don't want to start this argument. But he's a top pain in the ass. Top pain in the ass. You want to say it three times for luck? Three is my favorite number. Top pain in the ass. You're right. But he's good. I'm sorry, Mr. Doyle. It's not quite what I had in mind. Yeah. Sorry, fellows. Mr. Horace, I know it's not Frankie Harte. We can do that stuff, too. Just give us another chance. This guy must be crazy. I made a deal with Frankie Harte and his Orchestra, not Jimmy Doyle and his Flying Sack O' Maniacs. This is Frankie Harte and his Orchestra, without Frankie. Frankie wouldn't give us the band if it wouldn't work. - That's true. - What do you have to lose? What do I have to lose? Does this look like a peanut gallery?

The guys are all excited, everybody's all buzzing around, and Paul had a good idea. He said we should take the best quote about your band and put it outside. - Good idea. - Maybe take something to Downbeat. Very good idea. We might get another week out of this hotel with this.

You'll sing with Paul Wilson. - Come on, now. - No, I'm never coming out. Paul is waiting for you, baby. They're all there. Let's go. I'm no bimbo, you know. I see the writing on the wall, Jimmy. What writing? Did I ever call you a bimbo? After all we've been through, is that what you're going to say? - I hope I can trust you on this. - You can. - I hope I'm not signing my life away. - Just the band. That's enough.

Hold your side a little bit over... Jimmy! Jimmy! It's pretty. One of the nicest things is waking up knowing somebody loves you. Remember this? This old song I wrote for you? How can it be old if you wrote it for me? It was old when I wrote it. - I'm working on the words. - Are you? See? I've got the lyric here, part of it. - Want to see it? - I see it. I've heard it's going to be a nice day. What's the Theory of Relativity? That light is curved? I don't know. They say that only five people in the whole world know really what it's about. The Japs understand, from what I know. - Do you want to talk about it? - What do you mean? About the band and how you feel and... ...how you are. I don't know. It just didn't work. I got worried when I didn't hear from you for three days. I thought you were coming home and you didn't and... Well, I was... Didn't you get the telegram that I sent? No, I didn't get it. I didn't send a telegram. I wanted to be alone for a while, figure some things out. I stayed down south for a while. I understand. No, you don't. Don't tell me you do. But I had to do it, baby. - I understand that I don't understand. - That's being better. Sammy Sparks! Sammy Sparks! - Hey, man. - Jimmy! Hey, how have you been? How have you been? Meet some friends of mine. - This is Booty, this is Washington. - I hear you play a mean tenor. I've heard about you, too. How have you been? What are you doing? I went on the road with Frankie Harte, then I took the band over myself. - Kind of slipped away. - No. You heard that? Yeah. A little talk about it around here. No, it didn't slip away. What happened was, you know... I was working with bad musicians. You can't pitch new cats in Scranton. You've got to come back to the Apple. Same old faces, same old place. I wonder if I should be back here. Listen, man, I've got a little thing going - over at the Harlem Club. - Oh, yeah. Some really good cats. Come over. I will. I've heard a lot about it. - One problem, though. - What? - Do they let white cats in? - You come round the back. Before you get excited, just let me explain. Remember that cat Cecil Powell I always used to tell you about? We'd better go to lunch. I'll explain to you there. - What am I getting into? - A Buick. 1941 green Buick. Just get in. Trumpet player OD'd. Long story. Just get in the car. I'll explain to you later. If you don't get in, I have no way of talking to you. I'm not going to shout it in the street, so get in and I'll explain. - You remember Cecil Powell? - Yes. I met him and went to Harlem, this new club. It was fantastic. - Why didn't you call me? - Why should l? I'd be home soon. - So there was no reason to call. - Jimmy... - Hi, there. - Hi. How are you? - Are you pulling out? - Do I look like I'm pulling out? - Excuse me. - Yeah? I don't mean to... Would you look at me? If I look at you, I'll get upset. Yo! Hey, look at me! I can't believe this guy. I'm looking at you. You're being unreasonable. - Too bad. - Just a little bit inconsiderate. I can't believe this guy. I'm being inconsiderate? You know what I'm doing? I'm arguing with my wife. If you can help me solve the problem, you can have the space. - You don't have to get nasty. - Just a minute... Get off my back, for crying out loud! - I don't want to hear it. - Get out of here. Beat it, will you? Don't mess with her. The same to you! You're not getting this space if I have to die on the floor. - I hope you pop! - You'll never get this space! - Creep! Creep! - I hope you never get a space! I hope you travel round the block 50,000 times. - That was dumb. - Let's go for lunch. - I'm not hungry. - Honey, you're pregnant. Let's forget about this stuff and go and eat. That's right. I am pregnant. I'm six months pregnant. So you're going to have to pay a bit more attention to me right now. You opened the door for me. You didn't even wait to see if I got in. I have trouble getting around now. What do you think I am, a dummy? I just lost the band. If it had clicked, I'd still be with the band. Right? When you wanted to come back to New York, did I stop you? No, I didn't, right? So, you can't stop me. And I don't like you doing that stuff there. - What stuff? - The demo stuff. You're too good for that. They should be doing that for you. So, you'll be up there at nights? You'll be there almost every night? - So... - The other guys are married, too. I know. Well, I'll have to take the day shift and you take the night shift. Honey, you're making it very hard on me. You want me to smash this to pieces? Is that what you want me to do? That's what you're telling me to do. This is the most important thing to me besides you. If I can't do this, I'm not good for you or anybody. Do you understand? Paul Wilson called up. He's opening tomorrow night at the Up Club. - Yeah, I know. - He wanted us to come. - I said probably we will. - I'd love to. - Would you? - Yeah. Spend some time together. It will be good. - See the fellows. - Yeah. You know Ellen's depressed. I thought we could introduce her to Artie Kirks. - Artie Kirks? - The record producer I told you about. Now, look, if you want to go by yourself, possibly you and Ellen, that's OK. I don't object to that. I could meet you later. I didn't mean it like that. I'm sorry. Is it OK? - Yeah, it's OK. - OK. Wait till I show you what I got. Look at this. Oh, honey. You were looking at the words to the tune? Yeah, I was. You're going to call it New York? - New York. - That's what you're going to call it? Since we met in New York, we live in New York. "My vagabond..." - "...shoes." - "...shoes are longing to stray And step around the heart... of it. New York, New York." It's "top of the heap," too. - And this is the final version? - Well, not necessarily. I want to fix up some parts. It's very good. - I'll see you later. - All right. - Have a nice night. - Thank you, baby. - See you later. - I can change "top of the heap." "Bernice Conrad And The Paul Wilson Orchestra." - What am I doing here? - Come on, honey. You promised. You know. I can't do it. I can't do it. I just...

That's great. - You think so? Sure, sure. It's great. I wanted us all to meet tonight so I could ask if you approved... Excuse me, darling. If there are any problems, that's what I'm here for. - There's no problem. - Everything's fine. - Then everything's fine. - Not quite. I would like to know more. - You mean the deal? - Exactly. - It's logical. - When I heard her, I said, "That's it." Absolutely sensational, fantastic, a smash. - I tell you, from my mouth, this is it. - And this isn't just for one shot. One of the things I'm not comfortable with is the traveling. - The promotional tour. - Is that a problem? - I don't know if I want to travel. - What about the baby? - Exactly. - There's nothing we can't handle. - There's no problem we can't solve. - Let's hear what they have to say. I'm just emphasizing, putting in an exclamation mark. - Very good. Go ahead. - What about the kid? Oh, the baby. You're going to get it first class. I'll get you the best nurse, a car. I'll treat the kid like it's my own. - You just sing. - It will be in the contract. - I'm just emphasizing what you said. - You've emphasized twice already. Is it all right with you? It sounds great. Can't argue with it. - Sounds good. It's up to her. - Everything's all right? Everything all right with you? - Yeah, but I thought you'd... - Then everything's all right? If it's all right with you and him. It's great with you and them.

I'll play it as my theme song until who knows when. That's the Jimmy Doyle Sextet, later in the show... ...the entire theme from New York, New York. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you. Now I'm proud to introduce an old buddy of mine. We go back so long I'm a little embarrassed to tell you. He's here with us tonight, Mr. Cecil Powell.
