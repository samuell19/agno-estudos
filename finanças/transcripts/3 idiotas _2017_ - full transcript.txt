Ladies and gentlemen, please be advised, all electronics... - Hello? - ...and cell phones must be turned off. Sir? Sir, I need you to turn off your phone. - Give me a second. It's important. - I need you to turn it off now. Yes? What? Everything okay? Still? I have to get off! - Stop the plane, please! I must get off! - Sir, I need you to sit down! Sir! Sir! Sir! Please, there's an emergency... Let us through! Let us through! Excuse us! Where am I? Where am I? I'm allve! I feel fine! - Alert! We have a situation! - Sorry! Hey! Hey! My taxi! - Hello? - What's up? What are you doing? - Here, working. - They found Pancho. What? See you later! - Your breakfast! - Your pants! - See you! - Pull your pants up! Beto? Beto? - And this taxi? - I stole It. - What do you mean, you stole it? - At the airport, with a family inside. - Yeah! Where's Pancho? - Pancho? I don't know. - But you told me you found him! - I'm not the one who found him! Who found him, then? Stinky Isidoro. - Stinky Isidoro found Pancho? - Yup, so prepare your nose. Welcome. Come in. Thank you. - Is it here? - Yes. - Are you sure? - Yeah. He sent me this address. It looks like he's doing well. Wow! Excuse me. Thank you. Look! Stinky McToilet! It's been a while since I smelled you. Isidoro Velasco Campilllo, losers, founder of Ibeca, about to fuse with Teltech, the largest technology company in Latin America. That's all. You don't know what it is, right? You like it? $1.3 miliion! And with the exchange rate... Okay, and where is Pancho? You've got such bad memory. What's today? November 12. Five years ago today, I challenged Pancho to see who would be more successful with the years And look! Look around you. Diplomas, awards, magazines. Where am I? Way up high, daddy-o! Right, Mari? She doesn't understand. So where is Pancho? You don't know? Do you know where he is or not? Let's go. - Where is Pancho? Tell us! - At a ranch, where else? What did you expect? - A ranch? - Yes. And we'll have to drive a lot to find him, bring him out in the open. Why all the mystery? You'll see. There's much you don't know about him. Lots. What could be better than seeing him again, all together? How much did you know about your friend? You may wonder who Pancho is, who can interrupt someone in the bathroom, or got me off a plane. Before you meet him, let me tell you some of his qualities. He's a good friend, stubborn as a mule, brilliant, and from a good family. This is our good Pancho. He had it all to make it and from one day to the next, he disappeared. Some say he went to another country with his family, others that he got married, or was forced to marry, and yet others claim he got an operation and now calls himself Miroslava. No one has heard from him to this day. His disappearance affected everyone, and especially her. - She is Mariana. - Come on! It's really late! This is Felipe, the pride of Milpa Alta, nopal district, and his whole family. Felipe! Felipe! Felipe! He's the first to go to college in his family. And this is me. My dad decided I'd be an engineer since the day I was born. - It smells like the future. - It doesn't smell like anything. If you graduate with good grades, you'll have the world in your hands, son. 3 IDIOTS And as Felipe's uncle used to say: "Friendship always starts either with a good party, or when the party’s over." Catch it! Catch it! Get it! Get it! Get it! - I'm not doing anything to you! - What's this? Yuck! You really think this brings you luck? Give it back to him! Give it back to him! - He wants to cry! - He won't. He wants to cry! - Look what I found! - Hey, give me my phone! Don't take his phone! Hey, don't get violent! Okay, enough! Give him back his stuff! - Or what? - Or what? What's wrong with him? My phone! Your keys! Let's go, let's go! What are you doing? After them, come on! Come on, shorty, move! - Run, run! - It's closed! - Here! This way! - Run, run! - Go! Go! - No! My backpack! My backpack! Tell them something! Come on! - Here, this is yours. - Thanks! My camera's inside my bag! - All is well, all is well. - What do you mean: all is well? - It's all right. - Nothing's all right! - Come out of there or I'll... - What? - What? - I'll piss on your backpack! - Good! - I'll poop on it! - No. Better. - Okay, I'll piss on your bag! - Thanks. - You're welcome. - You have ten... - Ten. You'll see. ...eight... - What's this? - We tie it up here. Hold on. When I tell you... you turn it on. - Get back! - ...two... - Hold this. - Okay. - Are you ready? - Here come the Niagara Falls! Turn it on. - Turn it off, turn it off! - What happened? Let's get out of here! Come on. Oh, Lord! - Oh, no! - No way! I hope my camera didn't get wet. After that, Isidoro never ate another hardboiled egg. He made the whole corridor smell like burnt chicken. Straight ahead. - There's the infirmary! - Wait, wait! With her! The one with the lab coat! - Let's go with her. - Where's the infirmary? To the right. - What happened? - Up we go! What's wrong? - He got electrocuted. - Electrocuted? - Yes. - With what? It's a long story. - Hello, Mariana. - Hello, Beto. Being the children of prominent engineers, Mariana and I had known each other for a long time. You did what to his what? Maybe you could... check him out. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm! His scrotum is scorched. We thought maybe you'd have more experience in that area. - Oh, my God. - Since you're a doctor and all. Biomedical engineering and medicine student. All new students, please gather at the auditorium for the Chancellor's welcome. I think we have to go. - Yes. - Let's go. I haven't washed my hands. I'm not scorched. That's bad luck, I pass. Ah. Tsk. No way, they're your friends. - See you. - What? - Bye! Thanks! - So mean! - Good morning! - Good morning. I'm very happy to see each and every one of you on your first day of school. And for the official welcome... We want to introduce you to our beloved professor, - Mr. Escalona. - Hi. Thank you, Doctor, Ma'am. Gentlemen, good morning. What's the definition of perfection? Anyone? The state or quality of being devoid of defects, sir. That's correct. A bridge is a symbol of perfection. Each step in its construction must be perfect. - Is that clear? - Yes! Yes, sir, Mr. sir, right, sir. Unlike the lies your parents have told you, not all of you are geniuses. Look to your right. Look to your left. This is the competition you will have out there. For example, this bridge... is perfect. Perfection is what we demand from you. Perfection is what you must demand from yourselves. - Excuse me, Mr... - Escalona. Escalona. To build that bridge, didn't the engineers have to make several mistakes before finding what is perfect? I took this piece from a very beautiful bridge. Can you tell me how I got this piece from a bridge where each piece, each beam, each stone Is supposed to be perfect and unmovable? No! You don't know. This is what happens when you break the rules. Do you know how many lives depend on you? Don't make mistakes. Unless you want to belong to the losers' club, - like Mr... - Pancho Kuri. And no, sir, I always want to improve. I just believe we can learn from our mistakes. Oh, my, the loser's theory. It's not my theory, but Thomas Alva Edison's, the inventor of electricity. Whoo! Not everyone clapped. - Well, almost. - Almost. - Almost everyone. - Pretty much everyone. Whoo! The semester was just starting and we noticed Pancho was taking all the classes he could, which, curiously enough, happened to be the same classes Mariana took. Biochemical engineering. Who enrolls in that, for God's sake? Professor, it's almost finished. I tested it this morning with a couple of seeds. - It's going to work! Well... - But does it work now? - Let me talk to your father. - What for? Let me talk to him. Hello? Dad, I'm with Professor Escalona... Mr. Valtierra! Good morning. I have news. Your son will not be graduating because he was late in delivering his invention, so don't worry about getting tickets to the graduation. Have a nice day. Bye. No! But... Professor! One week, please! No! I was late because my mother had to be hospitalized. My wife died on a Sunday afternoon, and on Monday I was back here teaching. Rules are rules. No functioning invention, no diploma. Hey! What do you have there? Let's see. Come on! Oh, ho, ho... - What is it? - Wi-Fi seeds. - What? - When there's an emergency, you plant them, water them, and a router comes out. - What do you need? - I need to generate a magnetic field. - I already have a catalyst. Yeah. - The water! You have to contain the generated energy? Direct it. - It's a great invention! - It sure is. - He flunked him? - Big time. Who says "big time" anymore? Okay, who touched my charms? Mm-hmm! Hold on! - You took these? - Yes. - They're pretty good. - My dad either hates them or they piss him off. No, no, they're pretty good. - Amazing. - For real? -Yes. - Sorry to interrupt, but... these wi-fi seeds don't sound very real to me. And did Skype, WhatsApp, drones sound real? Landing on the moon or Mars? I don't think either of us can help him. We have our own project to work on. - Right, Beto? - Yes! Besides, Escalona's out to get you. - You better not mess with him. - Yeah. You are blaming me because Valtierra's no longer here? - No. - Sit properly, please! I'm not blaming anyone, but what's the use of a modern school If you have a rigid and old-fashioned system? With my system, my class is still number one. But according to what scale, Professor? The world is no longer the one you studied in. We students are getting increasingly more creative and proactive, but we have to face professors, with all due respect, like you. Your teaching doesn't change. There's no talk about innovation, only about grading, winning, overcoming. There's nothing about imagining, creating... You are going to teach me how to teach? Come on, let's go. - But... - Let's see. - We'll see... - Careful with the stairs, Professor! - You'll hurt your knees! - You should've thought of that before! You're in great shape, I'm surprised. Ms. Molina, please take a seat. This self-proclaimed teacher says he's better than our staff, so go ahead, Mr. Kuri, teach. Come on, we don't have all day! - Forgive me, Ma'am. - Okay. These two words should have an effect on you. And this effect has the power to help millions. Even to save lives. Whoever tells me their meaning, passes the class. - Oh, no, you can't... - It's all right, let him. You can use your books, notes, Google... but you have only 30 seconds, and... We're on the clock! Give me your book. Mr. Velasco... The definition must be here... Come on, look for it! Lend me your notebook. What's that? Time! Mr. Escalona, time Is up. No one has the answer, right? Go back 30 seconds in time, to the moment I asked the question. How did you feel? Mm? Surprised? Nervous? Curious about learning something new? Because robots are programmed to repeat concepts, patterns, to follow rules, but there is a difference between being a robot and being the robot designer: curiosity, ingenuity. This is not a philosophy class. Can you give us the definition of those words? These words don't exist, sir. They're the names of my friends: Beto and Felipe. And this is how you plan to teach engineering? No, sir, I could never. I'm just teaching you how to teach. And I know that you'll learn, because I never abandon my slower students. - Silence. - He called him a fool! Silence! You better invent as well as you talk, Mr. Kuri. Because without an invention that actually works, you won't graduate. And I'm the one who signs the diplomas. Time went by and we became inseparable. We were the three best friends. Or, as Escalona called us, the three idiots. Stop studying, man, come on. We all lived in the house my aunt rented to me and were known around campus for having the best barbecues. And Pancho, who claimed he knew everything, still didn't dare speak to Mariana. Let's go. Okay, how do we make a nanopill? We'll need the school's AFM plus someone who knows more about human biology than us. That's true. It's from Beto. Check it out! We're going to a wedding tonight. - Hey, so... - But how will we get in? I was going to say, we don't have invitations. Great! Beto's aunt just saved us. - What? - To the storeroom! Good evening. - Hello, good evening. - Hello. Your invitations? We don't have them, but we're here for the aerial gymnastics show. And juggling. - One second. - Sure. Juan, the aerial gymnastics guys are here. What's up, dude? Where did you find those costumes? - Be right back. - Those sure are tight, yo! These are very nice. - Let's take a selfie. - Yes, yes. - There we are. - Ready? - It's really nice! - Pedro, come here a sec, please. - See you later. - Yes. - Seriously? - What? Where's the Cartier watch I gave you? - Well, I... - You didn't like it? Er, I... You didn't like it, because if you had you'd be wearing it! No, the thing is... The thing is what? - Are you serious? - Smile for the magazine. Thank you. Hello? Oh, hi Mom! No, I just didn't have- What a catch! What are you doing here? I'm here to bring you these. And for the show. They're identical to the ones on the tables, of course. You can't hide good taste. May I have your glass for a second? Why? I don't want you to break it on my head after I give you a piece of advice. Your boyfriend is not good. He treats you like an object, he only cares about money and he'll make you miserable. Did I ask for your opinion? I bet you a date to the movies that in under a minute he'll tell you the price of his shoes. Deal. Come on, Mom, it has to be white, don't be ordinary. Tell me, idiot! What's your problem, man? Careful with my shoes! They're $600! $600! Ever earned that? No, right? Goddammit! So, what are you doing at this party with that arrogant boyfriend? It's my sister's wedding. - So you're here with your family? - Yes, I am. In fact, that tall man over there is my dad. Please tell me you take after your mom. - That's what they say. - I'd love to meet her. - Where is she? - In the graveyard. - At this hour? - She's dead. I'm sorry. What about that? Come check it out, I was just looking at it. What do you think? I just found her. She's gorgeous! I mean, she's perfect, anatomically speaking. - Everything's in place. - In place! Hug her, like she was your ice girlfriend. Okay! - Cool, dude! - Yeah. - It's awesome. - It is. - No. - Yes, dude. - No, no way. - Yes, do it! They won't see you. Do it! You haven't told me what you're doing here dressed as Jiminy Cricket? Some high class friends invited me. No one says "high class friends". - They don't? - No. Who was it? Beto? Do it! Cool! Look at this, dude! This is- What? It's stuck? You sneak into my sister's wedding, dressed like in Swan Lake... Hold on! ...and you criticize my sister's wedding, my family, and my dad. Hold on, one... What else? Who do you think you are? - ...two... - Bond. James Bond. Jesus! Trust me, man! Remove yourself! Oh, shit! - Shit! - Put it out! They ruined my wedding, Dad! Oh, shit! Let's go, let's go! Security! That was the first time Pancho approached Mariana. - Grab those three idiots! - Run! And as far as I remember, it was terrible! As you can see, it's a beautiful structure. You must emulate it. Good morning, Ms. Molina. Good morning, Professor Escalona. Pop quiz. Hand it out. - What? - Silence! But nobody told us! Silence! It's quite easy. No buts! You can thank these three idiots. As you know, if you don't pass the test, you have to repeat the semester. Come on, man! What did you eat? - What's that, Isidoro? - What? It wasn't me! Silence! - Who's rotting? - Professor, please! Leave the classroom! Cowards! Finish the test! We're sorry about what happened at the wedding, Professor. You're all expelled. - What? - How? Only the three of them! You are all expelled. You heard me! Let's see what other weddings you ruin. I only have one daughter left. I'm sorry, Professor, but you can't expel us. It was a private event outside the campus. So what? Rules are rules. The board wouldn't agree. - Damn you all. - Not that, either. Go finish your test. Sir, if you'll excuse me, Pancho is a terrible student. I can keep an eye on him for you. You'll be the first to know the next stupid thing he does. - One last thing, Mr. Isidoro Velasco. - Yes? The next time you need to pass gas, don't do it indoors. Look for an open space. Yes. I'll keep you posted. - Stop here! - Here! Stop now! Okay, I'm stopping. - It's horrible! - No, no, no! Open up! You should at least warn us! It smells like rotten fish! It wasn't me. You're responsible for global warming, you stinker! What? Global warming? After my appointment with Teltech's CEO. I'll have enough funds to solve that problem. That and the extinction of polar bears. And helping the penguins. You know how many penguins up in that mountain need your help? You know how many? What the hell- Who- What? He has an appointment with the president of Teltech. The greatest company, I told- You didn't read Expansion? Go ahead, take a gander. Culture. - Here's your magazine, okay? - What? Jealous? Look at me. Success! Pancho's not even featured in the horoscopes. Isidoro was right, and I don't get it. I was sure Pancho would be the one of magazine covers. Halfway through our studies, he had shown all of us his genius and his hunger for success. Can someone tell me how this is related to AFM, that is, atomic microscopy. - Pancho? - Yes. Nanotechnology works with atoms, and atoms are energy. The cool thing about the little pill is that it has nanomagnetic particles that merge with cancer cells in the blood. This will help us detect cancer way sooner, and with more precision than any other technology. We only have to do some tests. - That's all? - That's all. But we have a digestive problem. How do we stop gastric acid from destroying the transmitter? How's your robot going? Quite well! Want to see it? - It's right over here. - Sure! - Can I take a picture? - As many as you want. You mind if I take a picture? Okay, a bit more to the right and grab the apple. That's it. It's absolutely incredible. What's the helmet for? The helmet is so you can move it with your thoughts. - I don't get it. - Thanks! He means the brain's electric impulses, whenever you think. Imagine just thinking about taking the picture and then it takes it. - That's the idea. - Cool! Oh, geez. - Why's the Finder- - What is this? Copy? And that's how another semester ended. Here we are! We're top in our class! First, second and third place! I knew we'd worked hard! Let me take a picture. Yeah. A selfie. You were not first and second, you were last and next to last. What's the big difference between last and first? We were 200 students. - I barely made it, I'm the last. - And I'm next to last. Here I am, 6.2. Why is he so mad? Because he came in second. Imagine that. - Who's in first? - Pancho. He can do that, I can't! My family's on my case, they'd never forgive me. Not my mom, nor my dad, my uncles, my cousins, my siblings, my nephews, no one would forgive me! Felipe's family was so happy about their son finishing the semester that we threw a celebratory barbecue. Come in! Welcome! And he got so mad! But I went for it. - Your cousin is really cool! - What cousin? That guy over there. - What are you playing? - No, no, no, that's a she. That's Chela, she's not a guy. - You thought so too, didn't you? - I'm not talking! Hey! Pitch in, pitch in! Come on! Come on, don't play dumb! Over here! What's it for, Grandma? We've been doing this since my Felipe was a kid. We all pitch in to pay for his tuition, right, son? - That's right, Grandma! Thanks. - That's cool. - You're welcome. - I'm not opening! - No! - I'm not opening the door! - Me neither. - Who else is coming? -Who is it? - Hi, it's Mariana. Hi! How are you? I saw on Facebook you're having a barbecue? Yes, you want to come in? - May I? - Of course! - You brought dessert! Delicious. - Thank you. Make yourself at home. Wow, so much famiiy! That's great! ...and the ant said to the elephant: "I've got him, I've got him!" The joke about the ant, that's a funny one! - You know what's funny too? - What? That's funny! It's funny having to console your sister because a jerk like you ruined her wedding! - Hey! - No, hold on, dude! Where I come from, you don't interrupt women. Mariana, she's not a dude, she's a girl and she's my cousin. This is my family, not Pancho's family. Why didn't anybody stop me? Because I don't interrupt women. Bring her some water! Are you okay? - Take a sip! - No, take it away! - Mariana! - Mariana knows about this. - An ambulance! - There's no time for an ambulance! Let's move her together! Let's take her to the truck! - Be careful! - Call an ambulance! - Watch out! Watch out! - This way. - Come through! - Come on, cousin! - To the truck! - To the truck! In the back! Please, I need an ambulance. Quickly, please! Someone is choking! What do you mean you don't have an ambulance? Why isn't the truck starting? We won't make it! The ambulance won't make it on time! Yes, we will! Felipe! Some rope! Bring her here! The keys! - Hold on! Hold on! - All is well. - How are you? - She just fainted! No, no, no, wake her up! We're going to fall! Take that exit! - Which one? - That one! - You missed the exit again! - Which one? I didn't see it! - Can you please tell me in advance? - Can you stop arguing? - Mariana? - What? This is the beginning of a beautiful friendship. EMERGENCY Please! Here. Mom! Mom! It's "the mummy". - Your family's great! - Thank you. - And yours? - What? Your family. Where are they? - Traveling, as always. - Ah. Look! Well, we had to perform a tracheotomy. Fortunately you brought her in time. It saved her life. Now she's in a good mood, she's cracking jokes with the nurse, one about an elephant, an ant.. "Strangle him, strangle him!" Thanks. You too, Mariana. Thank you. The important thing Is that he's all right. - She! - She! Yes, she! You're very good at insulting people. Sony, I feel horrible. A movie would make up for it, and you owe me. I can't. Mr. Moneybags would scold you? - No one says "moneybags." No. - They don't? We're taking a break. He's been my boyfriend all my life. Well, at least you can wear your mother's watch. - I missed her that night. - I don't doubt it. Okay, well, I have to go. - Bye. - Bye. How did you know It was my mom's? I'm good at paying attention to what I like. Who are you, Pancho Kuri? -Who am I? - Yes, who are you? Who was the first man on the moon? Neil Armstrong. True. Who was the second? Buzz Aldrin. Anybody? No one? Exactly. No one remembers who came in second. 15 of the best companies in Latin America will come in search of new talent. It's your chance to lock in a job before graduation. Get moving! Quiet! Energy unit in the British engineering system. - What's going on there? - Is it on? No, wait! We have to protect it from the gastric juices because if they dissolve it, that's a serious problem. The pill has to be smart enough to lock on- Geez! Why didn't anyone stop me? What? CONTINUE SHOPPING - Beto! - What? - Let's go! - Let's! - He scores, he wins. - He's drunk! - Do it now! - Cut him off. It's time for the truth! He scores, he wins! No! Okay, let's go! - No! Come on! - A first-rate team! - Come on, come on, hit it! - It's mine! Goal! - In your face! - Okay, okay! In your face! - Will you take our picture? - Yes. Here. Check the light. All right? Thanks! - What a great guy. - Come on. - Okay, ready? - Ready! - Picture! - Picture! Now let's look tough. All done? - Go check it out! - Tough guy. - You're so tough! - Go see how we look! - How did it come out? - Thank you. Thanks a lot, Ricardo. - Do we look cool? - How do we look? What a pretty doll! No way! You put makeup on me! Was it you? Was it you? It was you! - Not me. - Hi! Hi, sweeties! - I should go now. - You have to go? Yes, they'll kill me at home. Bye. - Bye. - Bye. - Girlfriend. - Bye. - You left a kiss on my cheek? - I did! Bye, girifriend. - He really did! - Have fun. - Bye. - Bye. COPYING So, guys, do you think it'll work? It has to, because I'm this close to being kicked out of school. I know all the answers, but as soon as I'm sitting in front of the test, I don't know what happens. If you keep on leaving it up to luck, it's going to get worse. - How many lucky charms do you have? - Thirteen. The Atlante bottle opener also counts. One for fear, for the test, for money, work, your family, who are amazing. How can you live here and now if you fear what's coming so much? It's easy for him to talk because he has his life figured out. I don't. - I have to work twice as hard as you. - We don't all have your brain. It's not about the brain. It's about passion. I do well at school because I'm passionate about learning. I'm passionate about inventing. It's about doing it right, Mexican style. What about you, dude? Give me your backpack. - What? - What is it? No, don't mess with my camera! Pancho, be careful, dude! Ah, the best nature photographer ever is teaching a course in Portugal, and he won't send the letter. - The problem's my dad. - No way! - It's not your dad! - The problem is you. You're not an engineer, you're a photographer, and a good one. Imagine Chicharito's dad saying: "You're going to be a singer," or Juan Gabriel's mom telling him: "You, son, will be a soccer player." We're not all good or bad at everything, we're born with a specific talent. You want to do well? Follow your passion. You don't take success, money or fame to the grave, but you do take the pleasure of fulfilling your passion. - Cheers to that. - Cheers. Don't play, though. You're scared too. Scared of what? Hey... Mariana, sucker. You're scared of Mariana! - He's scared of Mariana. - That's a different subject! No, It's not! Tell Mariana you're crazy about her. Tell Mariana you think about her all the time. Tell her you want her to be the mother of your little Panchos. - Tell her! - And I'm the corny one! If you tell Mariana you're crazy for her, I'll tell my dad I want to be a photographer. - Beto, do you mean it? - I mean it. If Beto does that, I'll throw away all of my lucky charms. Huh? - He's quiet now. - Silence. Total silence, he's at a loss for words. Okay. - The cat got his tongue! - No, no, no. You'll see I'm not scared of her. Come on, let's go. - Wait, where are you going? - Where else? Wait, wait, wait, wait. - Let's follow him. - Let's go. Who's going to pay? Mariana! Mariana! Psst! Psst! Mariana! Hello. - What are you doing here? - Oh, you know, just looking at the stars. - Are you crazy? - Yes, a little bit. Do you want to go out with me? - What? - Do you want to go out with me? - You're an idiot. - Do you want to go out with an idiot? - And if l don't? - Then I'll die trying! No, no, no, come up! - Come up! - Did you say yes? - Okay, yes. - Wow, you sure took your time. Whoa! Pancho! No way! Pancho! I need mouth to mouth. Are you all right? You really scared me! - It was good. - Yes, it was good, okay. - Okay, go home. - Come with me. - No, go. - Come with me. No! No way! Are you all right? - Yeah, I didn't get hurt, I'm fine. - You sure? Okay. - It looked more dramatic than it was. - It looked very dramatic. If my dad knew I was here, at this hour, in my pajamas, with you? - He'd kill me. - He would. Your father hates me. You know, you and my dad have more in common than you think? - Yeah, right. - Seriously. - No way. - Yes! You're both obsessive, you strive for excellence... Yes, but he's military style. I understand about the bridge, about mistakes and all that. - Look. - No, you don't get the bridge thing. I don't? Why not? Um... we were going on vacation to Acapulco and my mom was driving. She was on the phone with my dad. And then... A tension cable became loose, and then another... and then another one. My dad heard everything because they were on the phone. I'm so sorry. He became obsessed with all his students being perfect. Of course... - Those metallic pieces are... - From the bridge, yes. Oh, God. - I'm sorry, I didn't know. - I'm getting too intense now. But that's what it was all about, so we could know each other better. - And what's up with you? - About what? Yes, what's up with your family? What's your dad like? My family, my dad. Let's see... My dad is... My dad is always traveling. That's how it is. What makes you happy? Right now? Well, yeah. I don't know, right now this... No, no, no, you want to get me wet, right? Let's go together! - Yes! - No way! Your dad! What? You fool... Hey, hey, hey, hey! Get a room! Stop singing. - Here? - Yes, it's here. - Come on. - I'll stop here. - Let's go! - Super! - I forgot my keys! - What? I didn't bring my keys! - We'll jump. - Let's jump. Stand on me! - I'm sorry. - Yes, yes, yes. - I can't! - You're so heavy! - Ready? - Yes! Be quiet! Come this way! That's my dad's room! I can't believe this! Look! - Another fountain! - No! Why don't you jump in and kiss again? If you go... - Now, now. - This way. Climb up and you pull her up. I'll push. - You want me to climb? - Yes! - No. - Here. One, two and... Look at his hand! That's cheating! - Let's do this more often. - Don't speak so loudly. It got tangled! Okay, you did it. Give me your hand, you can do it, trust me. I'm scared! - Don't be scared. - You did it! What a nice view! Mariana, is that you? Marianuchis! - Come on! - Go! - Come down! - Careful, Beto! - You got me? - Yes! Felipe! I'm coming, my rabbit's foot fell! Mariana, is that you? Felipe! Come down, dude! We'll see you outside. I don't know, Dad, it was a possum or something! - A possum? - I mean... - Ochoa? - Professor Escalona. Hey! You ruined my car! Come here! - What's this? - Diana? She- She wouldn't stop throwing up, I had in take her to the hospital. - Are you all right? - Yes. I'm pregnant. - What? - Yes! You're going to be a grandpa, Dad! How exciting! Check it out. - Silence. - I caught them all on Omega Ruby. I have gathered all the engineers to let you know that the Chancellor is arriving two weeks ahead of schedule. What do you mean, two weeks? So the presentation of your inventions will be two weeks earlier. The question here Is: Who has an invention ready to show the Chancellor right now? Me. I have one and I'm ready to show it at any time. Yeah, sure. Very well, Mr. Velasco. What is it? Well, it's a pill-sized device that works with an app. - Hey, that's our invention! - He stole it! I've been working on it for months. Okay, let's see. Mr. Kuri, do you have a way to prove it's yours? Yes, yes, yes. We haven't patented it yet, but this guy's always spying on us. Do you have proof? No, professor. Mr. Velasco, what do you have? A prototype? Because the Chancellor wants to see that your invention really works. I can make it work, but not in two weeks. I can have it ready. Of course not! You don't know what you're doing! It's not ready yet. Of course I know what I'm doing, it's my idea. Now I'll get him! Enough! That is enough! Whoever the impostor is, I'll get to the bottom of this. You can go back to your classes. Mr. Ochoa, I'll see you in my office. - In your office? - We have to talk about this. - Write. - Yes, sir. - I want to apologize for last night... - Write. - Yes. - "Dear Mr. Ochoa, I regret to inform you that your son, Felipe Ochoa, has been expelled from school." - Write! - You can't do this to me. My whole family works hard to see me graduate. I have your grades, Mr. Ochoa. You've failed many tests. Sir, I beg you. Give me another chance. Yes. Delete you name... Write Francisco Kuri's, and the two of us will write together the letter that expels your friend. If someone deserves to graduate, it's Pancho, not me. I see. Okay. That's all. You're the first Ochoa to go to college. And what a college, son! You're going to make it far! I'll let your family know, man! All is well! How is he? The blunt force trauma and brain swelling have resulted in a coma. Will he be all right? Well, that depends on him. He can hear us. Let's tell him things that'll wake him up. Miss, do you sell timeshares in this place? We'll need some for the Ochoa family. Hi, see what we brought. Don't make us use it on you! Come on, wake up! Come on! Felipe! Felipe's coma got all of us thinking. It gave me the courage to ask the photographer I most admired for a job. Hello, Ernesto, I'm very interested... You can't expel students at the drop of a hat. Those kids arrive at this school full of hope. Just because you lost yours, doesn't mean you have to take it away from them! Our philosophy is excellence, and compassion, as well. And If you don't agree, you can resign. Escalona cancelled it, you're not expelled! Here it is, cancelled! So there's no excuse, move that skinny behind and come back. Felipe, wake up! Wake up, Felipe, wake up! Blow out the candles! Blow! Very good! Congratulations! Go, Felipe! Go, Felipe! Felipe, wake up! Atlante made it to first division! Atlante won? Yes, 3-2 at the last minute, it was amazing, Herrera takes it, everyone attacks, he runs to the other side, gives a great kick and what a pass, Doctor! It was perfect! Uscanga has it, eludes one, eludes another, It's like a Sweet Sixteen ball! He leaves the defense behind, only the goalkeeper is left, he dances with him, what a play! - He kicks it and... - Goal! Goal! - He woke up! - He woke up! You're such a liar. Shh! What? You're such a liar. Uscanga hasn't scored a goal in two seasons. Thank you. I'll take your picture. Look this way! And the day of the job interviews arrived. Turn! It's a dangerous turn! You promised you'd get rid of your charms. This white Ganesh is for good vibes. This is for good luck. This is for abundance, here. The main lady. Here. This is for protection. This is my favorite, my Buddha. Ta-da! It arrived at home. What does it say? "Humberto Cervantes Del Rio." Here. Open it. Come on, open it! Open it! I'd like you to be my assistant while I'm In Portugal... Holy crap! He liked my pictures and wants me to go to Portugal with him as his assistant! You see? - Good. - What am I going to tell my dad? Remember our promise? Well, now you have to go back home. All is well. Good luck. Congratulations! Go on, guys. - Come on. - Are you ready? Turn here. - All is well. - Thanks! While Felipe faced the most important challenge of his career, I was facing the most important challenge of my I life: Telling my dad the truth and opening my heart to him. What happened to you? I... I had been expelled. I was walking down the street and a car hit me. Why were you expelled? Because I got very drunk and ruined the Dean's car. That's why. Even though you have a scholarship, your grades are not the best. Why is that, Mr. Ochoa? Fear. I've always been a good student, but I'm also the first in my family to go to college, and the truth is that it really scared me. I was scared of letting them down. But seven broken bones gave me enough time to think about everything. I'm no longer afraid. Quite the opposite, I'm happy and grateful that I'm here, with you, alive. Your candid demeanor is not necessarily what we're looking for in this company. Hmm. We need someone more diplomatic to handle the clients. However, if you're willing to change your attitude, we can consider you for the company. Look, sir, It took two broken legs for me to stand up and have this attitude. Believe me, I won't change it for anything. You know what? Keep the job. I'm wasting my time here with you. Mr. Ochoa. I have interviewed thousands of candidates over the years. The truth is that they all become, please pardon my French, ass-kissers to get the job. I see. - Where do you come from? - From my family, sir. Welcome. Thank you. Dad, have you heard the saying: "Turn your passion into your profession and your job will feel like a game?" That Pancho guy put ideas into your head! It's not that, Dad. I don't want to be an engineer. I'm really bad at it. But when I grab a camera, Dad, when I grab a camera, I can spend eight or ten hours... And I don't feel them. And you'll drop out of college a year shy of graduation? What will Escalona say when he hears you're going off to photograph streetcars and birdies? The Dean didn't take me in the zoo, Dad. He didn't carry me on his shoulders after working 12 hours straight so I could see the elephants. It was you. Dad, you gave me my first camera. It was you, no one else. But you'll starve as a photographer, son. So what If I don't make much money or I have a smaller home if I'm happy doing what I like, Dad? Dad! Dad! How much is that trip to Portugal? Thank you! Pancho! What happened? - About what? - With Isidoro. Nothing, everything's the same. I'm so angry he's presenting your idea, and you're so calm? Look, yesterday a friend got out of the hospital and got his first job. The other will finally be a photographer, and today you're here with me. What more can I ask for? Ta-da! Open it, don't break it. You're a wonderful corny man, Pancho Kuri. Me, corny? Life is corny. It gave me you... Let's go. - You made this? - With my own two hands. Don't ask! Thank you, everybody. It's an honor to be here presenting my project. You have been a column, a pillar in my education, a great teacher. Thank you, Chancellor, for being here. You two are the most important people in my life... right now. Let's begin. Here it is. The pill. For the morning after? A technology that can save lives. All I have to do is drink some water... ...and wait a couple of minutes for it to start working. What you see here is an app that works with the nanopill. A pill with nanocircuits that can send out my heart rate, my blood pressure, all of my vital signs... Wow! I know. You're all wondering: "Isidoro, what's this wonderful pill for?" To prevent diseases before it's too late. Goodbye, cancer, dengue, chikungunya, athlete's foot, erectile dysfunction. I'm saving the worid! That's the goal. At any moment all the data will be transmitted, my heart rate, all my vital signs. What we're starting to see here on the computer... What we're starting to see here in the computer at the top... It's a normal- They're coming... they're... It's a technical error. Stinky McToilet! - Stinky McToilet! - No, no, no! Stinky Isidoro! Stinky Isidoro! No, no, no! Silence! Oh, God! I'll see you in my office, Mr. Velasco. It was him! He ruined my invention! If it was yours, you would have tested it! Silence! Do you think this is a circus?! It's a respectable institution! You both have until tonight to tell the truth, otherwise you'll be expelled before the finals. And you, change your clothes, you stink! Get out! - What are you laughing at? - Yuck! We ask everyone to stay inside and not go out. The city has collapsed. When does your shift end, Mariana? I'll be in the hospital until 6:00 AM. I won't make it to see Dad. I'll give him his present later. I have to hang up, we're swamped. Yes, Mariana. It's beautiful, darling! Come on, blow out the candles. Bravo! I love you. - Dad! - What is it? My water broke! Take me to the hospital! Professor Escalona... Professor Escalona, I... I... - Dad! - I need an ambulance! Come on! - Ah! - Oh, no! Come on, come. Put me down. Come on, Diana. Come on! Hello! Hello, I need an ambulance! What do you mean you don't have one? - My daughter is about to give birth! - Dad! Dad, no! Wait, Diana! I'll go get a taxi! Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello? Mariana... Mariana, I'm giving birth! What? - Do you think you can hold on? - No! I'm giving birth! Diana! What is it? - I'm Pancho. - Here's Mariana. - Mariana! - Okay, Pancho, listen to me. The city is flooded, you won't make it. You'll have to help her. - To give birth? - Yes! Okay, okay, okay. Let's go. No... Breathe. Don't leave! No way! Okay, I have an idea. Let's put the phone magnet close to the seeds, see If they work. Okay? Help! Help, please! Diana's giving birth in the parking lot! - What?! - Felipe, prepare the room! Let's help her! Bring the raincoats. Help me! - We're here. - We're here, come, relax. Relax, relax! - You wait here for Escalona! - Okay. All is well! All is well! All is well! Escalona! Where is Diana? Where is she? - Pancho took her. - What are you doing here? - This way. - God dammit! Grab her. Mariana! Get on Skype. Skype with Mariana, connect with her. - There she is. Mariana, Mariana! - Let Diana see me! - Mariana, I can't do it! - You can! I'm here with you! What are you doing here? Dad, you have to trust us! There's no choice! Beto, go get scissors and hot water! Pancho, cover Diana. What is this? It's a nightmare! - Dad, you either help, or you leave! - Help, Dad, help! Okay... Jimena, come closer. I need you to measure the dilation. - Okay. - Let's see. A lot of dilation, a lot of blood... No, no! Take her away! With all due respect, sir. Mariana! I see nothing, no head, nothing! I can't see anything... - Diana! Diana! - No, no, no! She fainted! What do we do? What do you mean? Wake her up, she has to push! - Diana, please wake up, please! - She needs a surgical vacuum. - A surgical vacuum! - What? A surgical vacuum, you place it on the baby's head... Yes, the vacuum will pull the head out! Okay, I can- I can make one. Bring a compressor, a hose, a flask, cork, a funnel! Come on, let's get it done! Come on! The cork. Hold it, hold it. Insert this. No, no! What- No, no, no! Mariana! - What happened? - There's a power outage! Yes, I'm working on it. Wait. - Batteries! I need batteries! - Okay! From your cars, from the lab! Bring me batteries! I'll be right with you! All is well, sir. It's okay. - Here are the cables. - It's okay. Coming through! Okay, okay! Help me make a circuit. Put those on the chair, Miguel! The red ones... Take this end. We'll close the circuit. - You have it? - Let's see... here. Cross your fingers. And... one, two, three! It's back! Perfect, get on the computer! Felipe, Skype, again. Skype! - Wait, wait, wait! - Turn it on! - There she is. Mariana! - Hello! - I love you, Pancho. - I love you more. - Sorry, sir. - Go on! - How much suction? - How much suction? Not more than .5. Not more than .5. .5, we've got it. Stand back. - Give it to me! - Give it to him. More cable! Okay, okay, okay. Dad, please, I need you to push on Diana's belly like this! Push on it like this! Like this! One, two... Push, Diana, with all your strength! Push! Push! It's coming out! No way! No way! Push! Here it comes! I can see it! I love you, I love you! You have it? Watch the head. It's my grandchild! Welcome to the world of engineers! You can be whatever you want in life! - Here. - Dad! Congratulations, Diana! Hey! Where are you going? I'm not finished with you! I've kept this since my wife died and I promised myself I'd give it to an extraordinary student. Here. No, Professor, I'm sorry, but... I'm not your extraordinary student. That was the last time anybody saw Pancho. We never heard from him again. Then, college was over and we all graduated. Well, almost everyone. Felipe Ochoa Arce. Felipe finally did it. The first Ochoa to graduate. His family couldn't contain their pride, or the auditorium, his family. Isidoro Velasco Campillo. Isidoro Velasco also graduated, in spite of his gas and his cheating. The biomedical engineer, my daughter Mariana Escalona Muñoz. Mariana graduated with honors. It could have been one of the happiest days of her life... Dad! ...but not without Pancho. Everything comes to an end and while graduation is the end of your studies, but it's also the beginning of life. They were starting their lives as engineers, and me, as a photographer. There we go! - That's good luck! It hit you. - It is? Cheers. I met my friends at this school. - I learned a lot... - Cheers, Pancho. ...but my greatest lesson was to follow my heart, to follow my passions, and to be what I want to be in life. And I owe that to Pancho. We thought he would suddenly make it with a stupid surprise, but he never came. - Well, cheers. - Cheers. What I don't understand is why he left us, Beto. Why disappear like that, without saying goodbye? I don't get it. I know why. - The night I snuck into your place... - I knew it, you rat! You want me to tell you or not? While I was copying a file, I decided to go through your things. And guess what? I found he had two almost identical birth certificates. One under the name Francisco Kuri, and the other one under Alfonso. No way! I obviously took a picture. And I skedaddled out of there, I didn't want you to find me. No? Okay. There was only one way to find out the truth. Ow! Good afternoon, where are you traveling? To Tlayacapan. God dammit... TLACAYAPAN BRIDGE Excuse me... - The registrar's office? - The building with the arches. Damned miserable floors! I'm looking for Francisco Kuri. The best known Kuris around here were Mr. Francisco and Mr. Ezequiel. They died in the fire of the Hacienda San Gabriel. It was really ugly, even their little ranch hand was heartbroken. Their ranch hand? What was his name? Hold on... Pancho... no... Panchito... Ponchito! - Ponchito Perez, that was his name. - You don't say. Mr. Ezequiel and his family wanted to adopt him. That's why he stole the identity, to get into the college! Stinky Isidoro! Stinky Isidoro! Remember that day everyone humiliated me in the auditorium? You're a moron! Me, a moron? You're a fraud, Isidoro. - A fraud? - You stinky. Fraud? Don't forget this day! It's called karma! You'll remember this day too! Five years from now, we'll see who is more successful! A stupid, cow-milking farmer, or me, Isidoro Velasco Campillo! Mr. Ezequiel Kuri! Ring a bell? It's your dad, isn't it? Don't play dumb! Pancho Kuri is dead! You stole his identity! And that's fraud. It's illegal. Your life, buddy? That's the real fraud. It's coming! Shh! - I love you, Pancho! - I love you more! I'm sorry, Professor, but I'm not that extraordinary student. He didn't have the guts to tell you all the truth. He was a liar, a fraud. An identity thief. A charlatan. - Okay, pull over. - What are you doing, dude? Stop it! What's the matter? - I said stop! - What's the matter? You're going to kill us! My car, dude! - Get out! - You're a jerk! - What's wrong? - Get out! Why are you angry with me? Your friend was a fraud! He wasn't a fraud, he was our friend! Your friend? You didn't even know who he was! - I'm going to hit him. - Go ahead, please. You're going to start? - You broke my tooth, jerk! - You want me to break another one? - Get in the trunk! - Let's call Mariana! I'll call Mariana. - Relax! Now! - Yes! Hello, it's Felipe, a friend from school. Is Mariana there? Yes, but she's a bit busy today. - She's getting married. - What? Where? We don't have time to go get Mariana. - Don't listen to him. - Okay. Okay, fine, I give up. We'll go see Pancho, but we have to be back by 9:00 for my Teltech meeting. - Okay? - Hold on, let me. - I think I knocked him out. - Ha! Picture? Beto, come! Excuse me, do you know where the bride's room is? - It's that one. - Okay, thank you. Photographer... I'll take care of Mariana and you take care of Mr. Prada. - Deal? - Deal. - Is it time? - I don't know. Hello. - Felipe? - Please let me in! Let me in! - Hello, Mariana. - Hello. Three things. First of all, you look beautiful. - Thank you. - Secondly, I'm very offended that you didn't invite me to your wedding. I'm sorry, Emiliano didn't want me to. I knew it. And thirdly, we found Pancho. - What? - What? Darling, is everything all right? All is well, Emiliano! Okay. Thank you! You can't marry him! He's a chauvinist loudmouth who only cares about money. Emiliano has changed a lot, Felipe! I'm sorry, I'm sorry! Really, jerk? You know what this is worth? $3,000, you idiot! That's a lot! Is that changing a lot? If you leave, everyone will remember you, and this day, but if you get married, every day you'll remember you already had the answer and you took the easy road out of fear. Your answer is here. Mariana, "all is well". - All is well. - All is well. - Yes. - No! - Okay. - Okay, what do we do? - Is she okay? - Yes, she's okay. Come on, Mariana! - Come, Mariana! I'll catch you! - Okay. That's it. Be careful. Just get a good hold there! Careful, Mariana! - Almost, almost! - Come on! I'll catch you! - We'll catch you! - It's my shoulders! Hey! What are you doing? - Ouch! Mariana! - It's okay, it's okay. - Let's get out of here! - Where are you going, Mariana? Come on! Let's go! Come! This way, Mariana! No, no, no, no! Pedro! Help me, Pedro! - This is it? - Let's go! Help me! Father-in-law, help me! - What's the matter? - Help me! They found Pancho, Dad. What? Leave the baby, get In the car! Follow me! Quick! This can't be happening! Twice in my life! I can't believe it! Dad! Please stop hitting me! - What's Isidoro doing here? - He knows where Pancho Is. There's one thing, Mariana, - we don't know Pancho's status. - What? - If he's married or not, for example. - What? - He won't be married. - What if he is? Don't worry, we'll go back to your wedding and that's it. - You morons! - Ow! He won't be married, I promise! He won't be married. - Hurry! - I'm going as fast as I can! Hurry, Dad, we can't lose them! You're so stupid! You were ready to get married, but you'd rather live in poverty, with Pancho, milking cows. Shut up or I'll bury this ring In your balls! Go faster! - Oof! - Good Lord! - Looks like it's here. - Here? - We're here? - Looks like. Here are your keys! It's coming, it's coming The sowing, the sowing It's coming, it's coming The sowing, the sowing. All right, all right! Let's talk about the seeds, okay? All right, okay... The seeds face the sun. All right, now... The magnets. Now, tum the cell phones on. - They work? - They work! Very good, kids. - Very good. Wi-Fi... - Who are they? - What are you doing here? - We're looking for Pancho. I knew this day would come! - You mean Poncho. - No, Pancho. No, Poncho. Alfonso Perez. I knew it, he'll love it! Come, come with me. Wow! But... Walt for me. Poncho has bought all your photography books, Beto. We took the children to visit the bridge you built, Felipe. - Where is he? - This way! This way! - But where? - You came from a party? -Yes. - He must be with the robotics guys. There he is, with the robotics kids. There it is. There it is. Let's see it. Great, kids! Go on. Kids, you're all geniuses! Pancho? Oh! All this time... All this time... You never said goodbye. Are these your kids? Mm-mm. Are you married? - No, you? - Almost. I ran away. Do you want me to go back? You mean you only disappeared because of a name? - You know how long we looked for you? - No! - You don't? - A lot! A lot! - A long time! - Come here! Idiots! Look! - Isidoro? - From engineer to nanny. Like a pedophile Peter Pan, surrounded by children in a ranch. Five years, like I told you. With a huge bank account and an appointment at 9:00 with the president of Teltech for a merger. Huh? It means to get together, so your Totonacan friend can understand. Wait a second. Oh, It's Teltech. Engineer Velasco. - Yes. - How are you? Everything's ready for our dinner. Just a question, out of protocol. Of course, of course. How does it feel to have your scrotum electrocuted? Here is the president of Teltech. Come now, Isidoro, all is well. I've waited for this moment for a long time. Not content with ruining one, you ruined the weddings of my two daughters, but I don't hold a grudge. I have learned that our personal fears must stay in the past. - Oh! - Oops! I've been wanting to thank you for a long time. Thank you. Sir, I apologize in advance. Bravo! - Whistling and clapping, please. - You hush! No one stop me! No one! In addition to being the president of Teltech, Pancho invested his money in his own hometown, in children curious to learn, and his inventions were changing the whole region. The meaning? Anyone? I want you to go back 30 seconds in your lives. How did you feel? Nervous? Excited? Curious? But what do those words mean? It's the name of an extraordinary student, who made me learn that not only do I come here to teach, but also to learn from all of you. Let's welcome our recent graduate, the engineer Pancho- Poncho Perez. - Thank you. - Mr. Engineer. Thank you, Professor. Three things. One, follow your passion. Two, question your teachers. - And three... - Well... And three, be happy. Live for today. Bravo! THE REAL ROBOTIX CHILDREN... Demian and Esteban are students at ROBOTIX, created by Roberto Saint Martin, where robotics experts help children develop these abilities. The model is taught throughout Mexico and has expanded to Latin America and the US. In 2014, the "Robotix children” won 1st and 2nd place In NASA's International Air and Space Program. In 2016 they were also acknowledged at the World Robot Olympiad, India. And, in Mexico, there are many others who have dared to be an "Idiot"... Yuvia Lopez, Valeria Sanchez, Andrea Garcia and Monica Lopez created PROTRASH, where they help 37 million Mexicans who live in overpopulated urban areas. Innovating in the struggle against poverty, they exchange trash for incentives: 1 kg of trash for 1 kg of food. Fernando Mier-Hicks, a 27-year-old Mexican engineer, designed a technology that simulates the conditions in space to test nanosatellites. A constellation of these devices could take the Internet to the whole world. Approximately 50% of the crops for human consumption go to waste every year. Enrique Gonzalez and Flavio Siller created GENIUS FOODS, turning this waste into natural nutrients that improve the quality of processed food. Fernando Ortiz Monasterio is a Mexican architect, founder of VERDEVERTICAL, a project that intends to improve the environment, the quality of life and the urban landscape. He covers concrete surfaces with plants in one of the most populated cities in the world: Mexico City.
