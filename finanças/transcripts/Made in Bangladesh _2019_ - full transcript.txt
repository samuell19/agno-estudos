Don't rush! Leave in single file. Fire, fire! Allah, save us! Moyna... Moyna! Moyna! Shimu, are you OK? Shimu... What happened to your hand? Did something happen at the factory? What? There was a fire... Allah saved you. You get some rest. I'll cook some rice. We're out of rice. - Where are you going? - I'll go and get us some dinner. When's the funeral? I don't know. We should go and see her mother. Fucking job! What a pain in the ass. I have to go and get my pay tomorrow. I went today... The factory's closed. I still have to try. I'm not going... I'm not going back to that job. I'll get married. Then leave Dhaka. How many times am I going to escape? What if I'd died? A storm's approaching. I'm going. - Hey, where are you going? - Let me in. - The factory's shut. - I need to get my pay! I told you, the factory's closed. - If they don't pay, who'll feed me? You? - Shut up or I'll call the police. - Call the police! Bastard! - Shut up, bitch! Get out of here! Get your hands off me! Fuck your job! This bitch talks too much! - I don't care about your authority! - Go away! - Hi... Please listen. - What do you want? What's your name? Shimu. Shimu... Do you work here? Yes. Why? I want to interview you. - Are you a journalist? - No, I'm not a journalist. Can you come to my office tomorrow? Here, I'll give you the address. Keep this. I'll give you a fee for the interview. - Hello. - Hello. Come in. I've come to see Nasima Apa. - Have a seat. What's your name? - Shimu. Apa, Shimu is here to see you. Please wait. She's coming. OK. Shimu... I'm glad you've come. Let's go. Tell me about yourself. Your name, your age, where you're from, how you came to work in the factory. - Should I start now? - Yes. My name is Shimu. I'm 23. I'm from Rajpur village. I've been working at the factory for the past six years. How did you come to Dhaka? I was 13 or 14 at the time. I was a good student, but my stepmother wanted to marry me off to a 40 year old. I was too young to get married. So I stole my father's wallet and ran away in the middle of the night. After arriving in Dhaka, I stayed with my cousin. She got me a job at a shoe factory. I couldn't stand the smell of the chemicals... ...so I started working as a domestic help. But they would beat me a lot. My cousin finally got me a job at a garment factory. My job was to match parts by numbers since I could read. Modern Apparels? No. Before joining Modern Apparels, I worked in two other factories. OK... Is this the first accident at this factory or has anything happened before? A couple of months ago, a machine needle went over a woman's finger. OK... And what happened that day? Did you see the fire? No, we just heard this loud noise and we all panicked. My friend Daliya... had told us about a fire at her previous factory. So when we heard the noise that day we got scared. We thought we were going to die. Do you know... ...about workers' unions? Have you ever been to a meeting? I know a little bit, but I've never been to a meeting. OK... There's a meeting this Friday. Try to attend. You can learn a lot about labour law and your rights. OK. Keep this. OK. - Four eggs, please. - 20 taka. Keep it in the bag. Guess what I've got for you. A job? Eggs, eggplant and green chilies! Daliya... What's the matter? I don't feel like going to work. I wish I was married. Look at me. I'm married, but I still work. At least you have your own home. Look at me. I'm sick and tired of sleeping on my aunt's balcony. Do you know how much overdue rent I have to pay? Let's go. Reshma! Work faster. Aren't you done yet? Fold them nicely. Nice! Well done, Shimu. Well done. You didn't pay last month. None of us got paid last month. Next month. How am I supposed to get by? It's just for this month. - Did they pay the overtime? - Fucking assholes! They just sit there and get fat. Shimu Akhtar... Sign here. What's this? Take this. Give me my overtime. You'll get it next month. I've done my work. Pay me. Nobody is getting overtime. You'll get it next month. What do you mean, next month? Give me my money. Didn't you know? The factory was closed for inspection. - I don't care about that. - I spoke to management. Next month we'll clear all payments. Are you fucking kidding me? Think it's a joke? Give it a rest. - Reza, get her out! - Give me my money. Go! Go! Get lost. Motherfucker! How dare he push me?! They treat us like dirt! If we didn't work at the factory, a guy like Reza wouldn't have a job. - Son of a bitch! - Pushing us around like cattle. At least we get paid. My neighbour hasn't been paid for two months. This money will go on my rent. How will I eat? Hasn't your husband found a job yet? I'm going to a union meeting tomorrow. - Anyone coming? - Which meeting? In Badda? - Yes. I met Nasima Apa... - Who's Nasima? She works for workers' rights. She can tell us about the law. There's no law for poor people. Forget about the law. Tomorrow's Friday. Let's go and see a movie. No! My feet hurt after working and then walking home. I'd rather spend my day off with my kids. Day off, my foot! Did you see how he pushed me today? Tomorrow it'll be you. What other options do we have? Working as housemaids or begging on the street? Day off! Shimu... Moyna told me about this meeting. I'll go with you tomorrow. You guys can go. I'm going to see the movie. Tomorrow at noon. Badda bus stop. Hello. Hello, come in. - Khala, rent. - Oh... Who's going to pay for the other two months? Do you think I'm made of money? Pori's father is spilling blood in Dubai for what we have. - Khala, please... - Don't give me excuses. What's your lazy ass husband doing? Can't even support his wife? I'll go. Sit down. Watch the movie. I know you have problems at the factory. But I need money too. I'm marrying Pori off soon. Lose yourself in the fragrance. New premium perfumed Lux. Floral sensations. We're going to talk about two issues today. Firstly, let's talk about workers' rights. Secondly, we'll talk about how workers can organise themselves. I know you're from different factories. But I hope after today's meeting, we'll have some direction. Friends, your labour is turning the wheels of the global economy. But by paying you low wages, local factory owners, foreign buyers and multinational companies are making huge profits. In most cases, these garment factories prefer to employ women. They think it's easier to control women. A female operator is paid far less than a male operator. You have to remember there is a labour code in Bangladesh. You have to understand that and then organise yourselves accordingly. You can create a workers' union at your factory and if you register your union with the government then the owner will listen to your demands. You need signatures from 30% of the workers at your factory. Does anyone have a question? Please don't hesitate. - What are you going to ask? - Let her speak. Yes, go ahead. Tell us your name, where you work, then your question. My name is Shimu. I work at Modern Apparels. Shimu... those sitting at the back can't hear you. Speak up. We recently lost a co-worker in an accident. She told us about this meeting. So this law you're talking about, can it help us? Thank you for your question, Shimu. For your safety, for overtime, there are laws in Bangladesh. You must remember that workers' rights are human rights. Women's rights are human rights. Can you repeat this with me? Workers' rights are human rights. Workers' rights are human rights! Women's rights are human rights! If a piece of dirt gets in your eye you can clean it out. But when you see a woman without a hijab you can't remove that image from your eyes, from your mind. When you see that woman you'll have impure thoughts... - Hey! - What are you doing here? You're here all day. I need to talk to you. Let's go. - Where? - Dubai. How was your interview? You came here to ask me that? Are you pregnant? No! Then what? What do you want to talk about? Do you remember Nasima Apa? The lady who interviewed me. She invited me to the union meeting. Moyna also mentioned it. They said they can help us get overtime pay. I asked a question and everyone praised me. Don't get too involved. I've seen people end up in prison because of this union business. By taking money from people, you're turning her into a beggar. She has a right to justice. But she needs help! She's destitute. What's more important? Money or justice? Do you want to put a price tag on death? Hello, Apa. Come. This is Shimu. She worked with your daughter. Hello. Are you OK? It was wrong! Why did you invite us for tea all of a sudden? Did Sohel get a job? Not really. He's talking about going into business with his friend. Which friend? Why are you concerned about which 'friend'? You have to cook spicy chicken curry for us. I will when Sohel gets a job. You should eat less. You're getting fatter by the day. My husband likes it that way. He buys beef worth 500 taka per kg for me. OK, then eat... Eat what you want! Listen... I went to the union office the other day. Moyna's mother was there to claim compensation. I felt really bad. Farzana Apa was there too. You can't bring Moyna back by forming a union. A union will be of benefit to us. That's what Farzana Apa said. We can make our demands. With a union we can get Moyna's insurance money for her mother. Yes. - I really liked Farzana Apa. - She spoke so well. Yeah, but her hair is too short. A woman should have longer hair. - What's your problem with that? - She looks like a man. - Look... - Shut up. Nasima Apa gave me these forms. Take a look. You guys have to sign it. - Take it. - No. Please take a look. She also gave me this book. Do you know what this is? - What? - It's a law book. You know how they mess with our overtime? - They can't do it anymore. - We'll get overtime pay? - Yes. - There's a law for that? - Yes, there is. - What if the manager finds out? Yes, what then? We'll have to be discreet. The owner can't fire us for forming a union. It's against the law. Don't worry, guys. I'll sign. Give me the pen. Where do I have to sign? Damn! Do me another favour. Give these flyers to the other workers. - We need more signatures. - Give me some. OK. - Is that OK? - Yes. Take it. Take half. Stop your work for a moment. Please, stop work. I want to discuss something important. You guys have heard about the trade union. A trade union is a conspiracy. A trade union can't help the workers. Factories where unions were started have had to shut down. Do we want our factory to shut down? Speak up! No... No! Those who get involved will lose their jobs. Anyway, we've lost a lot of time. Let's not waste any more. Now get back to work. And if you have any complaints, speak to the manager. I want you to be careful. Apa, can I say something? Go ahead. I mean... I haven't received my pay yet. My rent is overdue. And my husband doesn't have a job. I'm in a tight spot. OK, I'll help you. Apa, 5,000 taka will be enough. I'll pay you back as soon as I get paid. It's OK. Just do me a favour. Can you do that? Yes. I need some photos from inside the factory for a report I'm writing. Apa, I don't know how to take photos. I'll teach you. Look here. The camera is on now. Press here. Can you do it? Try... Apa, you've got a really nice phone. It's my spare phone. You can keep it for now. - Show me. - Apa, look. Wonderful! Be very careful when you take the photos. Keep this. You're going overboard with this whole thing. I know exactly what I'm doing. Shimu, are you going to spend the whole day here? Go back to your machine. My food has gone off. Who gave you the phone? You're taking photos for that lady, right? What you're doing with the union... What's going on between you and Reza? Did you tell him anything? We'll all get into trouble. - Don't be so loud! - I'm not. I didn't tell Reza anything. And I won't. But what you're doing with the union will get you into trouble. You think he'll leave his family for you? Of course, he will! He's crazy about me. You think all your problems will go away if you get married? Hardly! Have you forgotten what it was like... ...being single? Everybody wants a piece of you. I don't want to talk to you! Let's go. Shimu... Shimu... - She's insane. - Why are you rushing? I swear I didn't tell him anything. Here... What's this? Keep this. Reza gave me two. Daliya gave it to me. How do I look? Come here. Let me see you up close. Put this on. Do you remember this sari? No! Did your lover give it to you? You are my lover! Have you seen Pori? Yes, she looks beautiful. - And the groom? - Very handsome. He gave her 116 grams of gold. - That's great. - Eat. Serve them food. Entertaining thousands of people Beautiful Komola is dancing Entertaining thousands of people Beautiful Komola is dancing Her lover is Rohim Mia The beauty is swaying her hips The beauty is swaying her hips The beauty is swaying her hips The beauty is swaying her hips A fairy will come from the sky Whose beauty knows no bounds On board a flying horse The prince will come secretly Her lover is Rohim Mia The beauty is swaying her hips The beauty is swaying her hips The beauty is swaying her hips The beauty is swaying her hips Thank you all for finishing the job on time. Now sleep here. It will be light in a few hours. Then you can leave. OK? Be on time for tomorrow afternoon's shift. OK? Sleep now. Why did you turn off the fan? Is this a joke?! - What the fuck? What's your problem? - Be quiet. After working all night why should we sleep without a fan? - Stop! Please! - You have to listen to us. I gave you biryani for dinner. Now you want a fan to sleep. Think you're royalty? Don't mess with us or there'll be trouble! Stop! Turn on the fan. Quickly. Go to sleep now. You have the fan. - Now be on time tomorrow. - We'll see. - Let's go. - Go now! We know you don't care about us. They have no humanity. Bastard! Says sweet things to make us work and then... What are you laughing at? Reza made such a face when we created that uproar. I want to see that face over and over again. Reza stayed up all night too. Damn! Daliya is shy. She loves Reza! Did you notice something? When we were all shouting Reza went soft! - So he should. - You're right. He should! You feel sad when Reza goes soft? Don't you see she gets upset when Reza's goes soft. Why should I be upset? Reza's wife can be sad! Daliya's heart breaks when Reza goes soft Daliya's heart breaks... Quiet, people are sleeping. My heart bursts When my lover walks across my yard with his sweetheart... - Come to bed. - OK. This is our ironing section. And this is our sewing section. Lots of women and girls work in our factory. They're very happy here. Sir, we're compliant with the government's pay scale. Each worker is paid 5,600 taka. Don't you have a fire escape? Yes, yes, we have. There's been no major accident in our factory. Please, Sir. Sir, what about our order? I think it's too expensive. Your factory is not even compliant. No, Sir. Our rates are very cheap. I was really scared when I took the video. Apa, what are they saying? I didn't understand. The foreign buyer is asking for a cheaper price. Imagine that! I heard they sell our clothes for a very high price. A T-shirt like this, for example... How many pieces do you work on in a day? 1,650. Think about it, two or three of these T-shirts are worth your month's wages. No, don't speak. Aren't you ashamed? Such a shameful thing to happen at the factory! What's that? Who's screaming? I don't want to hear a single word from you. You're in a position of responsibility. How can you? No, no, I can't tolerate this. Look, here comes the whore! She's been tempting me. This time I gave in. She knows that I'm married. Still she tempted me. Don't lie. You said you'd marry me. Shut up, bitch! - Stop that! - Let her speak. - I... - Don't say another word. Aren't you ashamed? Shameless woman! Get back to work! What happened? The manager called my aunt. And? He told her everything. She threw me out. Bastard! - I'll take revenge. - Quiet. They've ruined my life. Let's go. Everyone's looking. Hey, kid. Move! He said he would marry me. That I'd be his bride! He has my videos. What videos? Don't cry. What's she doing here? She's staying here tonight. Tell her to leave. Shimu pays the rent around here. Who are you to ask me to leave? I don't want to repeat what I heard. - What did you hear? - Daliya... What did you hear? Whore! Keep your voice down. You’re ruining our reputation by being here. - Sohel... - Leave, before I throw you out. You also want to get your hands on me? Come on... touch me! What are you saying? You think he's like Reza? You've gone crazy! I don't need anyone! Daliya... Shimu! Don't you dare bring her back. Sorry, the phone number you have called is unavailable. Apa, her phone's been off since last night. She's probably embarrassed to show her face. They didn't even let her speak. They just threw her out. Yes. Daliya made a mistake. But is Reza innocent? Not at all. Plus, it's illegal to fire someone like that. When the union is registered, you guys can fight for her. Right? The paperwork looks ready. Now you have to elect a leader. A union president. You decide who you want. Do you agree? Yes, it should be Shimu. She's been doing everything from the start. I think she can do the job. Shimu, please sign here. - Here? - Yes. Where have you been? Why? What happened? What's all this drama about? Who were you speaking to on the phone? Speak up. My friend saw you talking and laughing on the phone. Who were you speaking to? Do you hear me? Everyone saw! Everyone knows! Who's the man? You're not going to tell me? I was speaking to Nasima Apa. She gave me the phone. She's helping with the union. I used the money she gave me for the rent. Why would I talk to any man? Why do I work so hard? I swear upon Allah there isn't another man. Shimu, you work so hard. I'm starting that business with Mintu. Quit your job. I can't quit. I'm the union president now. Let me get the light. Let me go. OK, you can work, but I want you to be modest. I'm leaving. Try to come back early. Shimu, what's with the hijab? She's a pious wife. What's the matter? Sohel wants me to. Sohel doesn't want anyone to see his beautiful wife. Is that so? Shimu's husband looks like a movie star. I've seen him. Shimu, wait. Shimu... Everyone, stop working. Stop the machines! Stop your work. Put your handbags on your tables. Now. Where's your bag? Didn't you hear what I said? Give it to me. Is this what goes on around the factory? What have you been doing? Bullshit! Get her. Come! Where are you taking her? You get on with your work. Start the machines! Everyone sit down. Get back to work. What will happen to us now? Don't talk to her. Get back to work. I lost my job because of your union bullshit. They won't be able to kick us out like this. Once the union is... I'm the one who lost my job, Shimu! Now you're the president. Dreaming of going to America... Listen to me, Reshma. Others will lose their jobs too because of you. Why are you so quiet? What will happen now? Tell us! You and your bloody union! If the factory shuts down, I'll skin you alive. Listen, my husband is starting a new business. - You're all set then! - Yes! What do you mean, all set? Sohel wants me to quit. I come to work even though he's unhappy. For what? Really?! Will you feed me if I lose my job? No one's going to lose their job. Really? Well, see what happened to Reshma? We'll bring her back. There are laws. Right! Let me read something to you. Listen. Come closer. Clause 20, subclause 2(a) says: "The worker has been given one month's notice in writing, "indicating the reasons for redundancy, "or the worker has been paid in lieu of such notice, "wages for the period of notice... "...a copy of which is sent to the Chief Inspector "or any other officer authorised by him..." - Understand? - Yes. We just need a few more signatures. Please help me. Everything will be all right. This is a big deal. After Reshma was fired, the other women got scared. Then I read them the law. They realised that this is our only option. Now you have to submit this file to the Ministry of Labour. Apa, you'll go with me, right? No, they always want to know that the union truly has the workers' mandate. You should go alone. I have full confidence in you, Shimu. Apa, my husband's got a job. That's good news. It's good, but he wants me to quit. Who's he to say that? Tell him you're the union president now. You have responsibilities. What? Apa, we are women. We're screwed if we're married and screwed if we aren't. Hello. Hello. What do you want? I want to file an application to register a union. Room number 403, 4th floor. Up the stairs. Thanks. I need to go in. Do you have a token? Go in. Hello, Madam. Hello. Sit down. Why are you here? I'm here about our union registration. - You're Shimu Akhtar, right? - Yes. Madam, how long will it take? It'll take some time. When should I come back? You can come back in a week or two. OK? - Thank you, bye. - Bye. You're one of our best workers. You work really hard. Why don't you take a day off? I don't need a day off, Sir. Get some rest. I'm giving you an advance. Go home, rest and have a think. I'm sure you'll realise you should drop the union. What do you think, Shimu? Isn't it better to drop the union? No, Sir. Just because you know a few laws, you think that makes you a leader? I got the list of signatories from the Ministry. I'll send your names to the other factories. You won't find work anywhere else! Get lost! How can I betray them? Who? The women who signed up. If I drop the union now, they'll lose their jobs. What will I do then? Are they more important to you than me? You got involved in the union without my approval. You kept it a secret from me. What did I hide, huh? I was also getting some extra money and we needed that! I'm earning now. Why don't you quit your job? Please... Let me sleep. - Hello, Madam. - Hello. I applied to register a union two weeks ago. I've tried to meet you a few times. - Madam, my file? - Which factory? Modern Apparels. That file is with Sir. Madam, can't I meet Sir? No. He's very busy today. He has an important meeting. - Madam - I told you he's busy. Daliya... Hey Daliya... Hey Daliya... What have you achieved? Nothing! You talked about the law and took signatures. What are you doing about registering the union? Look, I've been to the Ministry a few times. It didn't work. Let's go together tomorrow. The officer might listen then. Let's call Reshma as well. You've been going there every day. Nothing's happened. What difference will it make if we go? Yes, what difference? We have to pressure the officers. What else can we do? I'll go with you to the factory tomorrow. Why? Your manager asked me to come. - Get the fish. - Turn on the lamp. Auntie. Hey, don't spill the water. This fucking fish won't die! Hey, where are you going? Inside. You can't go in. Tell me what you want. The manager asked me to come. Listen, control your wife. Make her drop the union. Otherwise, we'll strip her naked in public. - What are you saying? - Shut up! What did you say? - Calm down. - What did you say? - Watch your manners. - Be careful! Son of a bitch, I'll kill you. - Let's go! - How dare you?! - Let's go. - Asshole! Fucking asshole, how dare you?! - Let go of my hand! - Shut up! Don't cause a scene here, Sohel. I have to go. Why are you dragging me? - Leave me alone. - Get in the rickshaw. Get in the rickshaw! What's wrong? What the fuck is your problem? It's for your own good. What good? I have to go. Everyone is waiting for me. - Don't you get it? - Have you gone crazy? Yes, I've gone crazy. You can't leave! Stop this drama, Sohel. You will obey me. You won't go! - You can't stop me. - You won't go! Asshole! Open the door, Sohel... Open the door! Sohel! Please open the door. Asshole! What happened? Why are you screaming like crazy? Ask him. What happened? He doesn't want me to go to the factory. Then don't go. He's earning now. - You wouldn't understand. - I wouldn't understand? You work in the factory, make some pennies and you think you have wings? Nothing is more important than home. If Sohel throws you out, where are you going to go? - I don't know. - Shimu! - We need to go in. - You can't go in as a group. If our registration is denied, we'll lose our jobs. Let us in. Only one person can go in. Don't you get it? I lost my job. If we can't go in, they'll lose their jobs too. I said you can't go in as a group. He doesn't get it. Let's go. Uncle, please try to understand. We need to go in. There's no 'uncle' here. Call me 'Sir'. Sir! Let us go in. We all need to go. - Only one can go. Here's the pass. - What do you mean? - Don't you understand?! - We all have to go. - Only one of you. Otherwise get lost. - We have to go. - Go! - We're all going in. - What kind of women are you? - We're all going in. - Go! - Don't you get it? - Go! - We all need to go. - Go! - We're not leaving. Please, I need to go in. - Do you have an appointment? - Please, I need to see Madam. I told you, Madam won't see you without an appointment. - I need to see her. - What are you doing? Please leave. What's going on here? Why are you shouting? This is an office. Madam, my application? I never got the registration. Your file is with Sir. Madam, please can I see him? It's not that easy. Madam, I'm in big trouble. We'll lose our jobs if our union isn't registered. Please understand, Madam! Madam, I beg you. Please let me see Sir. - Is Sir in his room? - Yes, Madam. Sir, hello! Hello. What's the matter? - May I come in? - What is it about? I want to speak to you about our union registration. Sit down. Let me see the receipt. There are some problems with this application. What problems, Sir? You're missing some documents. It's complicated. I submitted all the paperwork. We have signatures from 30% of the workers. There's nothing I can do about it. Sir, I took a lot of risk to do this. My friend Reshma lost her job. The manager has blacklisted us. If the registration isn't approved, we're in trouble. Please understand, Sir. All the workers will lose their jobs. 68 workers and their families... Sir. I'm sorry. There's nothing I can do. Sir, if I don't get the registration, my friends downstairs will kill me. Please go. I have a meeting. Please leave now. What are you doing? If you don't sign, I won't open the door. Do you know what you're doing? I'll do whatever is needed. I'll call the press. Do you know the punishment for blackmailing an official? - I'll call the police. - Call the police. Call them! Sign or I won't leave this room. I couldn't, even if I wanted to. There's pressure on me from above. What pressure? From the factory owner? - We know all about these things! - That's enough. Have you no sense of proper behaviour? Get out! I'm not leaving without my file. I couldn't, even if I wanted to. There's pressure on me from above. What pressure? From the factory owner? Switch it off! Give that to me. I'll scream. I'll cause a scene. Everyone will hear the recording. Sign the file. I couldn't, even if I wanted to. There's pressure on me from above. Thank you, Sir. English subtitles: Day for Night
