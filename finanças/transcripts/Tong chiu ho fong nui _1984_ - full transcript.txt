There are five commandments in our creed Firstly, you shall not kill Yes Secondly, you shall not drink alcohol Yes You shall speak the truth Yes You shall not steal Yes Fifth, do not commit adultery Yes Should you transgress in any way, you'll be expelled Yes They say you're Chang An's gifted female scholar ...with an uninhibited & amorous literary talent Nothing but frivolous talk I'd say Indeed modest of you to say so Regardless of whether it is true ...or if they are rumours I do not wish to hear more Yes Yu Yao Mei, a girl from Chang An's Li family, in January of the year of Han Tung, ...becomes a Taoist The Goddess of Heaven administers rule ...from Quan Lun to the north heavens Inequity not be purged, till ye die... Ling Nan lychees generate so much body heat Please remind me next time... not to eat so many Madam, I've heard that if soaked in well water... they're much lighter The co-existence of Yin and Yang energies... Oh, teacher Of late, Secretary Wang complains of weak kidneys You mentioned that mystifying Yin Yang concentrate When can it be ready? Every ingredient is available What we now lack... is just a good quality medicinal tripod Oh, that's no problem at all I'll give you ten taels of silver to buy it Thank you, madam Yiu Liang... you are so audacious! There is a sermon going on inside ...and you should behave yourself I mean, such blasphemy! Madam Shie A sermon could be given any time, any where Whenever you wish I could give one at your home... Come, look at this This silk feels really light Oh, it should be comfortable to wear! Do you know what kind of silk it is? It's the silk from Bok Chau Right... Madam Shie This silk is a royal gift to the court ...and priceless I asked the councillor to send over two maids ...to that horny official of Bok Chau In return he gave me... Be careful! This is really so beautiful and rare! Look...So pretty... Look... Hey, my ear rings! Fei Hsiang, Wan Yang's ear rings are so fragrant Let me take a sniff Hmm...like some vintage Ge Zuo wine! Let's play 'find the earrings' shall we? Okay... Give it back, you naughty... You're a Taoist priestess, yet why wear earrings? Give it back Come on, give it to me... Sister Yuan Gi, you're the host tonight You should hide the earrings; I'll be the hunting bird Alright! No peeping I want to be the bird... No, I'm Wan Fei Hsiang I can fly, I should be the bird I've hidden them Coming I see. The right foot moves but the left doesn't Must be definitely inside the right sock Really? Sure Must be in there Look Let's see where they are You all must be exhausted Thank you A breath of nice fragrance! May I ask who is it? Just call me Lu Chiao Thank you Lu Chiao So nice of Miss Lu Chiao Yes... Well, have you found the ear rings? Wah Yang, you didn't take back the earrings, did you? What if I did not? If you didn't...Well then, I'll let you ladies treat me as you like Oh, really? Come They're here Where? Where are they hidden? It's so refined out here; Was it out of boredom... that you came out to seek pleasure & make merry? No. Most Taoist priestesses at the monastery... are just sycophants of Mandarin officials I didn't wish to mix with them Yuan Gi you should learn more from Wah Yang You shouldn't have left, without learning how to perfect... the pills of immortality Are the Taoist pills really that important? More important than poetry? Can't necessarily be said so The reason I joined Taoist sect was to... become an independent self-sufficient woman Well-said! Come, have a drink Facing the wind we sigh, flowers repeatedly fall Spring returns yet the fragrant longings don't These peonies ignored because of their high price Their arrogant aroma even intimidates buterflies Flowers so deep red must be from palatial gardens Leaves so dark green that dust dare not settle there The same if transplanted to the Imperial Gardens Young lords then wouldn't buy them without cause You study classics; What have you learnt? You know, we've been too licentious Life is to pursue happiness Whatever I do, I never repent Come on, let's tread the mud... It's great fun... We used to do this while ploughing back home The farm soil was so loose and soft Yes. Look, they are playing... like a bunch of kids Do you like treading on mud? As a child I used to do that everyday Here, everyone. Come have a drink of mud-wine Tsui Pok Hau Yu Yuan Gi I have heard of you I haven't heard of you Well, the Literary genius of Chang An It's a shame these few years I have not had... the time to read and write Where do you want me to take you? Wherever this boat drifts to From a lover? A girl whom I used to know as a kid After I moved apart from her... she married another man He was unfaithful and tortured her She committed suicide with this hairpin... by piercing her throat Blood...bleeding for a day and a night before she died I killed that man Blood stain on this gold hairpin ...hasn't come off since then! Where is it? Here Why didn't you choose to be her husband? Did you let her marry that man... so you could be a leisurely and carefree knight? My friend is waiting for me outside Duk-Goo Shing Yang, as a military officer you dared to conspire with Yin Shu... and assassinate Secretary Cheng Wei Yi I, Tsui Pok Hau must kill today an old thief like you I, sword-maker Auyang, must behead today a malingerer like you ...for the sake of justice Please don't do that It certainly must be lonely up there Say, if one becomes a celestial being... would it be very lonesome and adrift? If you were to ascend the heavens... my heart would cry to see you off And where would you go? A wanderer is doomed to move about There'll come a day when he may need to pause What happens then? I'll borrow a girl's body ...over and again Flowers make poems Frost make the fairies Sleep with open curtain ...facing the hill Well written You're so learned Why did you become a Taoist priestess? What else could an erudite girl do? Didn't want to be some rich merchant's wife Nor wish to be a concubine Don't prefer being a courtesan Nor liked being a Buddhist nun I was reluctant to give up my hair Only choice left was to be a Taoist priestess Why did you chose to be a gypsy swordsman? Me? I don't like being someone's husband Nor be a high ranking official I don't prefer being a business man Nor be some General going about... annexing territories It's mostly these corrupt officials I can't tolerate So I can only be a swordsman Being a man is lucky, I think One can enjoy benefits of being a senior official ...or at worst become a wandering swordsman Auyang the sword maker The friend you saw at the riverside He made this sword A good friend of yours? When are you going out to kill again? When would you come back? I go on without turning back I rush in the plains for a long journey, carrying a sabre and a bow I never change even if I lose my life I'm not only sincere but brave My strong will is inviolable Though my body perishes, my soul will stay on Even as a ghost I remain strong Earlier on I had already warned you Spiritual doctrines require total determination How could you leave monastery at own will? Not everyone can cultivate to be a Taoist Fortune favours only a few Why do you bear a grudge? I know I'm wrong and willing to repent I hope you could take me as a disciple again Yu Yuan Gi repenting her mistake In July of 7th year of Han Tung She rejoins to the monastery Lu Chiao According to the written records, If you take this concoction for thirty days ...your body will be light as a feather If you take it for forty nine days... then you can be a divine being Miss, please don't take anymore Didn't you wish that we both become celestial beings? No, Miss Miss... Chang An's Ping Kang Lane is full of singsong houses 3,000 households lean on the curtain In the brothels on the main avenue... every girl is as beautiful as a piece of jade How strange! Hey, it's Yu Yuan Gi Yes Yes, that literary lady Come over here, come Why is she in Ping Kang Lane? A crystal clear mirror with such a fine pattern!

She is a gifted scholar! Yes... That's right...so what's the reason? So please do tell us the reason Does the poetess Yu take things too hard? Mirrors polished, washed and patched here Miss Only by softly touching your own mirror would the beloved of your heart... hear your words deep inside Really? Oh right, I've found your favourite flower It's so beautiful You stick some too No Come on Here, look Come, sit down Yu Yuan Gi ...everyone eagerly awaits your company I have to pretend being a horse Alright... I'll take you as a stallion You've already dressed up as a man You'll be everyone's delight Good, good He is Taoist Yung of the Lung Sai family He is totally dedicated and seldom socialises He's made an exception to be here... because he wants to make your acquaintance You're too kind Although I'm always flanked by girls... my heart is clear as a mirror Good. This calls for a toast Yuan Gi, we are both Taoist When can we discuss the practises of our doctrines? You are from the orthodox school ...while I have been expelled Are you afraid...I'll lead you astray? Good... Good Is it hot? Those 'charcoals' you brought ...are really terrific What do you mean by 'charcoals'? Female pimps who control the prostitutes They curse and beat a girl up... like a piece of crackling log on fire Taoist Priest Yung, you've been here all night... just observing these activities; why have you come? Yuan Gi, I've come to admire your talent ...not to indulge in sensual pleasures Come, let's drink... Since you are insensitive to such ...mundane pleasures Come...have a drink Come...I'll scorch you Come, come here... Isn't that fun? They have feelings, too ...yet they're used to such treatment In this place... all are treated equally Man can play games on women ...and vice versa Go and enjoy yourselves! Come, scorch him, strip his clothes Come here You come over here Come! What a nuisance! Miss Miss I found this while I was cleaning just now It bears the name of Taoist Yung Splendid. He delivers us some money just when... we need it desperately Good... Good... This wine is from a Persian friend I never thought you were so good It's just luck Talking of playing polo ...it's still a man's world Thank you for being so generous A pity, this isn't a whorehouse though! So I should not accept your money I wonder how a single lady... can afford to live so extravagantly every night Right! Men don't believe that a woman can live alone ...and enjoy her life How long do you think your savings will last? Don't worry, after all this splendour... I'll retire to the simple life If you want to become a recluse, why let all men in Chang An... witness your splendour and grace? I might want someone to become a recluse with me Made by Auyang the sword maker? You know swords as well as you do the pen Who is he? The best sword maker around here Where does he live? Shih Li slope. East suburb of Chang An Since that heavy rainfall... this is the second time I see you I haven't seen Tsui for a long time It's you I'm looking for... need you to make a sword What kind of a sword? Not one...I need a pair Of what length? Say, three feet by ancient standard And how wide? 4 inches Any particular style? Like a couple in loving embrace I have to taste the owner's blood ...to ascertain the quality of the sword My blood also contains Pok Hau's blood Everywhere there is unrest & aftermath of war Pok Hau, I've no idea where you might be! I feel terribly sorry... for having to bother you It was necessary You have a mild touch of the flu But your cold waist and feet are anaemia symptoms And it's difficult to cure you You drink too much ...and have overindulged in sex I think you should retire as soon as possible ...and focus on spiritual discipline Alright! But I need a man to accompany me One who can respect me and... who can accommodate my lifestyle; To accompany me in retirement Are you that man? Yuan Gi, such loose behaviour of yours... makes you no different from other courtesans If you think I'm a whore for being with one I like, then each time when you see me... and you abstain from coming close; Aren't you worse than a whore's customer? I come because I admire your talent But when I see your decadence, I am determined to withstand ...the temptations of flesh That in true sense is obtaining enlightenment Come, try out your mettle There is a man who represses himself like you He is Auyang the sword maker He is like a strong piece of steel ...while you're like a piece of intricate jade; One which easily breaks Almost, let's go in! Look, Miss Yu is here Miss Yu An acquaintance is marrying today Come and join the fun Yes, go on in. Come... Alright!

From Sheung Chau, quite far from Chang An I hear the people there have put up a rebellion Initially, yes But then, even the soldiers pillaged and killed What was the reason for the uprising? No farmland...there's not enough to eat How else could one survive? Sorry, we just finished a performance elsewhere ...that's why we're late Continue to play and sing I'm also an art lover I hear Yu Yuan Gi is talented and beautiful ...and surrounded by many beauties I've since long yearned for her Isn't that right? There are so many ladies here I wonder which one is Miss Yu? I am here. May I know your name? How come so many other big-foot women are here? It seems Poetess Yu only bears a name Although a bit disappointing, but she's still a woman This is the capital of Tang How dare you be insolent here? Who are you all? Me? I am Kung Meng Wu So Kung, the notorious killer of corrupt officials, turns out to be a dog! A Dog? What do you want?

Wandering everywhere Killed how many? I don't remember And how many female bodies 'borrowed'? I have lost count You and Auyang claim yourselves to be heroes ...killing thugs and traitors Say, would you dare kill an evil emperor? I'd kill the same way What have you been doing the past two years? I don't remember Hey, this winter... I'll hold a wine and poetry function in the courtyard It must be enjoyable Lu Chiao must be becoming intelligent, following such a literary talent... with an increasing fame like you Lu Chiao is my only personal companion I hope she is happy the rest of her life If you had not pursued that bandit Kung here ...would you have looked me up? You have too many visitors ...including the chief of bandits Not really. In fact, I was bent on looking for a man What...scared you, did I? I am not in the mood for a man today Miss, the sword maker is here I have made the swords you ordered How many times have you refined it? A hundred Have you tried them? Yes How many strings has it broken? Fifteen What's all the string talk? Using hair strands to tie up straw pieces ...to test out the sharp edge Of these both, which one is sharper?

Sorry, I'm not in the mood That can't be, Miss Yu How much do you want me to pay for it? Wan Bai Chai, is it true with each eight rounds ...you can compose a poem? Bai Chai was merely describing his poetic talent I'll use three rounds instead of eight Really? Li Shang Ran's line referred to a lute with 50 strings Doesn't make sense A lute has twenty five strings only Why did she say fifty strings? Oh, you're a crackpot Your lines 'It's easier to acquire a rare gem... than to come by a true lover'... are still the greatest My mistress reads them to me every night Since when are you so nice as to... accompanying your pet concubine every night? Yi Shang passed away in a Cheng Chau monastery ...a little over a month ago How did it happen? A friend from Cheng Chau said... he lost his sight and died of dejection Fei Hsiang also wrote from Wah Nan... saying he has not changed his mad ways; And ended up having two of his teeth knocked off! Fei is still so crazy and so likeable She can't tolerate even a little wine Lu Chiao, are you unwell? It's nothing Go inside and rest I'm fine Well then, let's drink away Do you need money? Don't leave me any more money I won't use it anyway I want to depend on myself Being a girl does come in helpful at times Finally...I get to hear your moaning at least! What, you're going to leave it at that? C'mon, get up and see me out Miss, I'm so sorry I couldn't get up in time Are you feeling a little better? I'm alright Lu Chiao, are you pregnant by any chance? Is it Pok Hau's? Or Fei Hsiang? Or Taoist Yung? So even you don't know it! If the child belongs to those bandits ...you sure can tell me No Take some medicine and get rid of it No miss, I won't I want to return to my hometown After giving birth, I'll marry With whom? With Tsui Pok Hau? No Miss, presently I'm saving money What for? To redeem myself Redeem yourself? If you want to go I can let you go any time I have treated you like my baby sister Why do you speak of redeeming... and regard yourself so lowly? No Actually one can live freely without... having to marry or bear children ...and solely depending on a man! No, I've been born as a girl slave ...not so casual & elegant as you You are a GIRL, not a maid Who has made you like this? Tell me, who? This medicine is for abortion Now be good and take it You have followed me for a long time I don't want to see you ruin yourself ...nor see you leave If you leave, I'll kill you I know you can kill me You are the Lady, I'm a maid No - You're not a maid - I am You are a girl I have never treated you like a maid I am - You're not a maid - I am You're not... There aren't too many happy days in one's life Right? I wish to buy back Lu Chiao's freedom You're cultivated according to religious doctrines What do you want her for? I want to let her return to her hometown Your lifestyle doesn't suit her Shall appreciate if we could discuss her price What price? I have never treated her like a maid Why should there be any price? I've already let her return to her hometown She's gone to get married Yes, maestro...what is it? I would like to meet Miss Lu What do you want with her? I... I want to tell her that... I have saved up 20 taels of silver I wonder if that's enough to redeem her She's gone back to her hometown to get married May I ask when she'd be back? I have saved up 20 taels of silver for her She's gone to get married, how would she return? Really, so many guys like Lu Chiao And struggle to want her So many men desire you, too But you reject them Lu Chiao was born... for belonging to you men I'm not that kind of a woman I...sort of belong only to myself Look at you, sitting there you look so coquettish Lying down you'll be all the more luring How about teaching some of it all to Chau Yuet? Last night when I was in bed with her... oh boy, she was so stiff! Come and drink this potion They say you're quite strange, but I wouldn't say so You all must be thirsty. Here, please have this Miss, it smells so awful here, what could it be? Yes... It's a dreadful stench What are you talking about? It's so fragrant! Miss, what's your name? Lu Chiao This... Hey look Lu Chiao is dead, her body is buried here Come and look! Lu Chiao, Lu Chiao... Hurry up you both, okay! Yes...sure Haven't yet stripped her? Be quick I'm here, too Come on Me first It should be me Me first Your Taoist admirer turned out real sentimental! Guess he couldn't bear to see you arrested ...so he killed himself! He has been bleeding for over a day Many scholars have jointly petitioned ...for your pardon Yin Wen Chang however is of the opinion that: Although you have a brilliant mind... your ways are unacceptable And reckons you ought to be beheaded without delay I know your executioner has a swift hand Your pain will only be momentary; My sword is quicker than him If you let me kill you now... your suffering will be even shorter You want to kill me with your own hands How pretentious of you! My heartfelt gratitude, great hero I won't let your kind go easily satisfied Hey, will Pok Hau return? Would he ever? This place is guarded so heavily Whoever comes, it's of no use Let's go Come on, please You come and go as you wish Have you ever asked me what I want? Well, what do you want? Are you coming or not? I won't Yuan Gi, why weren't you prepared to leave? I've beaten many tracks other women wouldn't dare And don't feel up to it anymore! Pok Hau, why didn't you continue to be a drifter? I'd have loved roaming about with you Without you though, it's meaningless I'll accompany you in death instead Feel loath getting up... in dreary spring to apply make-up It's easier to acquire priceless treasure ...than to come by a true lover! In May, the 9th year of Han Tung's reign, Auyang the sword maker killed... the Hero Tsui Pok Hau and... Yu Yuan Gi, the literary talent of Chang An!
