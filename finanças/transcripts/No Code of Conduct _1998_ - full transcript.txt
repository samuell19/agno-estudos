Hey. [ Claps Hands ] Let's go, folks. Club's closed. You can't stay here. Thomas. Nobody else comes in. Understand ? All right. [ Door Closes ] [ Men Muttering, Woman Sobbing ] We're clear. Maria, oyeme. Tienes que cooperar. [ Maria Sobbing ] No puedo. Son peligrosos. Pero, ¿ que piensas, mi hija ?Spit up the balloon ! [ Man ] Hurry up ! Or I'll cut it out of her myself. Patience, amigo. Patience. No. You listen,amigo. My patience is running out. You have 60 seconds to produce that merchandise, or we walk and there's no deal. Apurale, apurale. Abre la boca. [ Moaning ] !¡ Abre la boca ! [ Gasps, Sobs ] !¡ Abre la boca ! !¡ Tomatelo ! Maria, no te quiero lastimar.I don't want to hurt you, Maria ! No te quiero lastimar. Maria, I don't want to hurt you ! - [ Gasps ] - This is getting us nowhere ! [ Retching ] [ Chuckles ][ Coughing ] [ Maria Sobbing ] Test it, Cameron. [ Maria Whimpering ] - It's pure. - So, then we have a deal ? - Sorry, amigo. No deal till she coughs up the other balloons. [ Woman ] He's right. I'd hate for you to lose $10 million over one balloon. [ Gun Bolt Clatters ] No offense, amigos, but this is a business. Y'all better get littlesenorita over there to cough up the other balloon... or we got a serious-ass problem... up in here. - Phillipe. - Maria ! I really hate to waste her. You're so pretty. Willdog, step back. I have a better way to handle this. Shane, put a bullet in her. Try not to hit the other balloon. [ Gasps ] No. - What's the problem, Shane ? - No problem. Do it ! Or would that be considered conduct unbecoming for an undercover cop ? - Fuck you, bitch. - [ Gun Clicking ] - [ Whimpering ] This is a marvelous display, amigos, but you know what ? I'm not impressed. It seems you got some problemas here you need to fix up. We'll give you a call. You promised us, if we okayed the merchandise, that you would have it delivered... to the abandoned warehouse within 48 hours. Fuck with me, there's no deal. Oh, there'll be a deal, senorita. Your boss, he's a very smart man. He knows that $10 million of my product... is going to make him $50 million in the streets. But right now, you're in no position to tell me... where and when I make my deliveries. We'll give you a call. Vamonos, Phillipe. Maria, estos gringos pendejos no saben nada. [ Door Opens ] [ Door Closes ]What the fuck is this ? We were supposed to get in, get out, get paid and be gone. Shi, this is bullshit. How'd you know he was a cop ? My father was a cop. Clean this up. I need to make a call. This is bullshit, man ! Yeah, I hate this shit. [ Police Radios, Indistinct ][ Chattering ] [ Man ] We're going to have to cordon off this area a little tighter. [ Man ] Captain Peterson. - I came as soon as I heard. - Mr. Disanto, thanks for coming. I didn't want you to find out about this on the 5:00 news. What the hell happened here ? This is one of our... young undercover police officers. He was murdered and his body dumped here. Oh, dear God. Who is it ? [ Man ] Officer Frank Fields. - One of yours, right, Bill ? - Yeah. That's right, John. He was one of mine. - I hope we didn't interrupt your golf game. - Nope. Not at all. - Shouldn't we have been involved in this ? - I'm not so sure you weren't. Sorry. Mr. Disanto, this is John Bagwell. He's the head of the D.E.A. in this district. Julian Disanto.Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. How are you ? Sure. Yeah. I think-- You know, we've met a few times in passing, but you probably don't remember. Mr. Disanto owns this property. He's planning to build a drug and rehab center. What kind of a sick mind would execute a police officer... and then dump his body so close to the headquarters ? Somebody who's sending a message. Well, they certainly got my attention. Captain, if there's anything I can do-- anything at all to help-- please don't hesitate to ask. And, if you'd be kind enough to convey my condolences to the officer's family. - I will. - Mr. Bagwell, it was nice meeting you again. Thank you. Thank you.I'm sorry about the conditions. If you'll excuse me, gentlemen. I'm late for a meeting with the mayor. [ Sighs ] Bill, I think we should have a talk. - Want to take a little walk ? - All right. Oh, Bill, why didn't you tell me you had a guy undercover on this ? Didn't realize he was out so far. Well, local D.E.A. has been onto a group of traffickers... bringing heroin up here from Mexico. Now, you know, it's possible that your undercover guy... just might have stumbled onto the U.S. connection. Did he get any information to your department about anybody ? Not a thing. What do you know ?[ Sighs ] Well, something big's about to go down right here in your backyard. How big ?Talking about a shipment of heroin... with a street value of $50 million.[ Whistles ] Shipment that big coming through here shouldn't be too hard to find. Glad to hear it. But I don't want you to do a goddamn thing. We've got to let that shipment arrive unmolested. That's the only way we're going to figure out the U.S. connection. Wait a minute. You trying to tell me I'm just supposed to sit back... and let $50 million worth of heroin onto our streets ? What are you, crazy ?All right. Now, Bill, before you get worked up, listen. My agency has already established some of the minor players in this operation. We've got to find out who's running the show. So, what the hell am I supposed to do ? Stand around like a mannequin ? Hey, you're going to retire in less than a month. I would love to be able to tell Governor Roberts that I've got your support. I'd also like to tell him Officer Fields didn't lose his life for nothing. Bill, I'm asking you to trust me on this. Look. Frankly, I don't agree with your off-the-record tactics, but I will trust you this time on one condition-- that I'm part of the operation. You got it.All right. Listen, I got to run. I'm going to catch up to you later. Okay.Okay. Oh. How's that kid of yours ? Is he still a cowboy like his old man ? No. He's a real family man now. Clear. Clear. Clear. [ Gulps ] Clear. Backup, right ? - No. - I didn't think so. Let's take 'em. On three. One, two, three. Drop the gun.[ Gasps ] Drop the fucking gun ! - Drop the knife. - Shoot him, Jake. - Drop the fucking knife ! Shoot the fucker, Jake.Drop that fucking gun. Drop the fucking knife. - Just shoot him. - Drop the-- [ Groans ] Got him ?Got him. Good work. Good job. [ Infrared Beam Whining ] You're dead, Peterson ! Shit. You're dead too, Delucca. All right, gentlemen. Let's rerig the staging area. Everybody all right back there ? Everyone okay ? You guys okay ? All right. All you cadets come in. Come on ! Come on, ladies and gentlemen. Let's go ! Everybody, gather in here close ! Listen up ! Listen up ! Let's go ! Let's go ! All right, friends. What you have just seen... is a good lesson in what notto do in a situation of this nature. Who can tell me what they did wrong ? Come on ! Come on ! Come on ! You know. All right. Parks.They didn't wait for backup, sir. Correct. They did not wait for backup. As a matter of fact, we may have lost that officer last night... because he did not wait for backup. Friends, I cannot emphasize this enough. You are not Starsky and Hutch. You are not Crockett and Tubbs. You are not training for a TV series here. All right ? The things you see dramatized on television have nothing whatsoever to do... with police work or law enforcement, with the possible exception ofN.Y.P.D. Blue. All right. So, remember, you always wait for backup, and you always wear your vest. Not like some people I know. Where is your vest, Peterson ? - Cleaners, sir. - A lot of good it's doing you there. All right, ladies and gentlemen. These proceedings are concluded. You are dismissed. I'll see you tomorrow morning at 10:00 on the pistol range. - Kaylin's birthday tonight, kid. Don't be late. - I won't. Thank you all ! You okay ?[ Scoffs ] - What's his problem ? - Oh, the state just claimed sole custody of his children. Oh, shit. That's too bad. That's real bad. Shall we ? Yeah ! So, what do we win for acting like idiots today ? Who was acting ? You miss her, don't you ? No. I love sucking ass in evidence all day long. You're doing the right thing, Jake.Jury's out on that. Rebecca's just worried about you. If that drill was the real thing, you'd be dead right now. Would you miss me, Paulie ? Well, if it isn't Starsky and Hutch.Andrea. Officer Johnson. When you coming back to vice where you belong ? You're the one that stole my partner.Well, I miss you. The job just hasn't been the same.Hey ! No ?Uh-uh. How are things going with you and Rebecca ? Oh, just great.Come on, Jake. It's me. Well, we're working things out, you know ? Well, if you need a good listener, our friendship's always meant a lot to me. Likewise.Come on, Andrea. Come on, Andrea. Save it for the streets. - Big night planned ? - Yeah. I just love busting pathetic married guys... who can't communicate with their wives. Don't even go there. I just wish there were a better place to stick this wire. Any ideas ? Uh, Johnson, we, uh-- Bye, Jake. - If you need to talk, you know where to find us. - You kids play safe now. [ Imitates Siren ] Drop the money ! Drop the money ! He's got a gun ! He's got a gun ! Drop it ! You drop it ! You drop it ! [ Imitates Gunshots ] Grenade ! Down ! [ Imitates Explosion ] Drop it, copper ! Freeze ! You freeze ! Drop it ! Drop it ! Drop the gun ! Youdrop the gun ! Drop it, copper ! What the hell you doing, you paper-pushin' pansy ? Hey, Pappy, how you doing ? How you doin', Jake ? - Hey, talked to your dad this mornin'. - Yeah ? What about ? Well, now, that's, uh, confidential. Well, that figures. Hey, hey. Come on now. Your old man can still kick your ass, you know. And you old-timers stick together, don't you ? Ha. That's right. Have to. You know, your old man was the only one that stuck up for me. Kept me in this place.Yeah. Lucky you. Sir, I don't mean to bother you, but we have an emergency. Sergeant Williams really needs to see you. [ Men Chattering ] Excuse me, sir. It's Boyle. He's been asking for you. Now, be careful, Jake. He's come unglued. Here's some insurance. You protect yourself. Thanks. And, Jake, I got your back.I know you do. Boyle, I'm puttin' my gun down where you can see it. It's about your wife and kids, isn't it, Michael ? You want to talk to me ? I'm tired of talkin', Jake. That's all I've been doin'. Talkin' to shrinks. Talkin' to lawyers. Talkin' to myself, mostly. And if you talk me out of killing myself, I'll be talking to Internal Affairs inside a rubber room. Ain't that fucking right, Jake ? Cigarette. No. You mind ? Today's been a beating. I don't have nothing left, Jake. Lost my wife. Lost my kids. Even lost the dog. I know how you feel. About to lose my wife. About to lose my kid. Don't even have a dog. If that's not bad enough, I'm working evidence now. [ Both Chuckling ] Yeah. There you go. Good man. I'll go buy us a drink, yeah ? [ Engine Off ] [ Door Closes ] Hi.Hi. Party's not over, is it ?No, you're just on time, Jake. As usual.Oh, gosh. I'm sorry I'm late. It's not me you need to apologize to. How you doing, Pop ?I'm doing. Excuse me. So I screwed up, huh ?It's her birthday, Jake. It's still her birthday, son. Why don't you spend some time with her ? Right, Dad. Hi, sweetheart. Hi. How are you doing, kiddo ? Sorry I missed your party. ♪ Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday Little Kaylin ♪♪ Mister Bunny Rabbit. What are you doing up so late, huh ? Waiting for you.Waiting for me ? Waiting for me ? I don't think so. I think you're waiting for somebody else. I think you're waiting for Mr. Tickle Monster. Mr. Tickle Monster that eats your faces and chewer of butts. Make him stop ! [ Giggling ]Can't win. Tickle Monster rules !Monster, go away. He's gone.[ Laughing ] Did you brush your teeth ? Phew.Uh-huh, uh-huh. [ Laughs ]Are you sure ? Uh-huh, uh-huh.Good girl. I'm sorry about today, kiddo, but, uh, Dad had some grown-up stuff to take care of. But I'll make it up to you tomorrow. Promise ?I promise. Hey, Dad ?Yeah ? When are you moving back home ? [ Sighs ] I'm-I'm working on it, sweetheart. Even though Mom says you're a screwup, I still love you. [ Scoffs ] Mom said that ? About me ? Tsk. Imagine that. Well, I still love you, too, angel. [ Shi ] Midnight. South yard. Phoenix Trucking. Yeah. I got it. [ Phone Beeps ]Shipment's in. Deal's locked. Is the money counted ? Done.Yo, Shi ! We've already capped one undercover. What we got to do now is get our shit done, get our merchandise and get the hell out of town. Steve, I don't recall asking you for your opinion. Well, maybe you should start asking me. Why don't you just relax, Shaft ?Corn Dog, Willdog, Mad Dog-- Hey ! If Shi could've waited just five minutes before she killed that stupid-ass pig, Gold Tooth and his entourage would have dropped off the merchandise, then I wouldn't have to carry my ass all across town to deliver this here shit. Well, shit happens, pussy boy.Fuck you, man. Will the two of you just shut up ? I see Cameron's shit. Where in the hell is he ? Oh, that old redhead's springy, freaky, freakin'. Went to buy some more porn. - That's all I know. - You mean to tell me he went to get his shit wet ? This deal needs to go down tonight without any problems ! We'll come back for him. Let's move. Midnight. South yard. Phoenix Trucking. Yeah. All right. I'll be there, John. [ Phone Beeps ]What you up to, Pop ? Not now, son. Not now.Okay, secret agent man. Thought you were retiring next month. I got to go, hon. Good night.Bye. Thank you. Thank you. Should I be expecting you back at the house later ? I'd leave your front door open. All right. Be mindful. That little girl in there loves both of you very, very much. All right ? Good night.Okay. Good night, Pop. I think Kaylin really liked her present. Jake, she doesn't need a stuffed animal. She needs a father. All right. Somebody who's going to be there for her. That's what I need too. Well, I need a family, like, in one that supports me... and a paycheck that supports my family. Yeah, well, maybe if you didn't pour so much money... into that repainted rust bucket out there, you wouldn't have to work so much. What about that minivan out there in the driveway I'm making payments on ? And this house for Chrissake, huh ? What about that ? Rebecca, I-I belong here with you and Kaylin. Jake, it is the same old thing. I mean, it's work before family. It's who you are. All right. It's who your family is. For all the complaining you do about your father, you're becoming exactly like him. [ Sighs ] I'm tryin' real hard, Rebecca. Real hard, you know ? I'm a vice cop stuck in evidence lockup. I don't go to the shooting range with Paul anymore. I come home and I seed the lawn. I bought you a minivan. I hateminivans. I'm afraid if I become any more tame that I'll be so boring you won't even want me, anyway. So, I-I-- I can't win. Jake, I knew who you were when I married you. [ Whispers ] But I can't-- I can't do this anymore. I mean, I can't sit around and wait for that phone call like Officer Field's wife did. I can't. You know what ? There's a festival tomorrow. There's a children's festival in the park... and, uh, thinking that you and me and Kaylin, we could-- we could all go together as a-- as a family. You mean it ?Of course, I mean it. How's that sound ? In fact, tonight I'll go straight home, go to bed, be back here first thing in the morning. You have my word. I promise. What do you say ? That's a yes. Is that yes ? Yes.Yes. Good. [ Andrea On Staticky Radio ] Keep your eye on me, Paul. Looks like we have our first customer. Hey, red. Wanna party ? - Come on. - I don't like this one bit, John. I don't like it either, but... unless that heroin makes it off that truck, we got no chance to make a bust. !¡ Vamonos ! ! Vamonos !Come on. Okay. That's good ! [ Peterson ] Here we go. There you go, amigo. Ahh, buenos noches, gringo. Badges ? We don't need no stinkin' badges. [ Chuckles ] All right. Get this down, will you ? White van. Mexico license plate-- India-Romeo-Juliet 3-8-2-1. I-R-J 38-21.All right. I got it. [ Bagwell ] But I'm sure you'll find this model fully loaded, sir. [ Peterson ] Looks like they've done business before. Amigo, por favor. Amigo-- [ Bagwell ] In business there must be a certain element of trust, no ? Looks like they're moving. [ Engine Starts ] [ Bagwell ] All right. Let's give 'em plenty of slack. [ Static Buzzing ] [ Cameron On Radio ] Now, we gonna do this ? [ Andrea ] All right. Your room or mine ?Piece of shit ! [ Cameron ] Most definitely mine. Freeze ! Paulie. [ Laughs ] Shit, Jake. Man, you're lucky I didn't shoot your ass. Yeah, I should be so fortunate. Anything interesting going on here ? Uh, it's kind of slow. Johnson's up there working our first client. I'm down here trying to cover her with this piece of shit equipment. - Keeps shorting out. - Right. Want the good news ? - Yeah. - I got a date tomorrow. - What do you mean, you got a date tomorrow ? I got a date tomorrow with my wife.Hey ! Congratulations, partner !Hey, if all goes as planned, you know. A little badda-badda, badda-badda, badda-bing ! Bing, bing, bing, bing-- - Right on. - Now, wish me luck. So, this is the party room. Nice place. Mind if I make myself at home ?Uh-uhh. Who's your daddy ?[ Static Crackling ] Slow down, baby. We need to talk business. Mmm, I want to talk about your tits. You know, a little bit of-- Hey, our little orange-haired freak ought to be back. - I said slow down ! - Let me see that thing. [ Static Crackling ]Who rigged this ? Do you know ? I wonder if it's orange on the bottom. - Your fucking tits. - Dead as a doornail. You're fucking wired ? You cop bitch ! - What the fuck ? - Jake ! Jake ! There's cops in there. Let's get the fuck outta here. Fuck ! - Goin' to guns, Paulie ! - Damn it, Cameron ! Let it play out. Run ! Go ! Let's go !Go get the van ! - That's Jake and Paulie ! - What the hell are your people doing here ? - Get in the van ! Come on ! - Let's go, Shi !- Freeze ! Freeze ! - Damn it ! I said freeze ! - Shi, come on ! [ Steve ] Shi ! [ Cameron ] Shi, get in the fucking van ! [ Groans ] Johnson's hit ! I'm goin' in !What ? Paulie ! - [ Grunts ] - Paulie ! - [ Groans ] [ Cameron ] Let's go ! Fucking go ! Come on ! [ Grunts ] Paulie ! Paulie. Paulie. - Bill, watch it ! - They're trying to kill my son ! [ Willdog ] Come on ! Now ! - [ Car Alarms Wailing ] - You got it ! Come on ! Get in ! Let's go ! Fuck it ! Hands ! Let's see 'em ! Hands ! Come on ! Jesus Christ ! [ Groaning ]You all right ? Come on. Come on. You all right ?[ Groans ] Yes. Your dad's in there, Jake ! Your dad. Your dad's in there.Jesus Christ ! Dad ! Pop, talk to me. Come on. Come on. You're okay. Come on. Put you right here.What the fuck's going on ? We're cops ! We're cops ! Help us out !All right. All right. It's gonna blow ! It's gonna blow ! I got you. Follow me.I don't know where we are. What's happened ? I went along with you on this one because you said you needed my help. Now, I got another dead police officer on my hands, and I still don't have a clue as to why. I want some answers, John. The license plate on that van... came back registered to the Sisters of Mercy Orphanage in Tijuana, Mexico. And the van had never been in the United States !Bill, I took down... those numbers exactly the way you gave them to me !Bullshit ! Bullshit ! Hey, Bill. We're on the same team here !More bullshit. Okay, I don't have any answers. All right ?That's not good enough, John ! Now, we got 50 million bucks worth of heroin flooding the streets, and you don't have any idea who the connection is yet, do you ? Answer me that question ! Do you ? Do you ?I can't talk to you-- No. I can't.You know why ? 'Cause you don't have shit to say ! I can't talk to you, man. I can't talk to you. [ Man ] All right. We're gonna wrap this up over here then. [ Woman Radio Dispatcher ] Can you take that 48 ? Glad you're still alive. You mind telling me what the hell you were doing here last night ? You mind telling me what the hell youwere doing here last night ? Oh, I just thought I'd stop by and save your ass, that's all.Oh, yeah ? Yeah.Maybe I'll see you at home. "Thank you" is popular these days, you know ?Thank you. Don't mention it. [ Shi ] You screwed up, Cameron. I don't think he's gonna let this go. [ Cameron ] Listen, Shi. If he loves you so much, why don't you have him come down here and save your ass ? Just shut your mouth, Cameron ! Whatever. Willdog, we're only an hour from drop-off. I say we go. We can't drive this thing. Every cop in Phoenix is looking for us. Wasn't for this overpass, we'd be fucked !We don't have a choice. We can't just pull up to Hertz and off-load $10 million worth of chunk into a rental. Teardown alone will take us hours. We don't even know where the shit is ! What we ought to do is just put a bullet in Cameron's head. We can do that. I don't even need a reason. Listen, Shi. What I'm saying is, get your boyfriend down here with the limo to come pick the shit up ! Good idea, Cameron. Let someone else pick it up and we don't get paid. And they'll probably kill us for being so fucking stupid. Hey ! Hey ! What the fuck is that smell ? Oh, damn, man. We got a fuckin' gas leak. [ Engine Off ] [ Car Door Opens, Closes ] [ Sighs ] It's about today, Rebecca. I know, Jake. It was all over the news this morning. God, how dare you. You gave me your word. You had Kaylin and I scared to death. Not even a phone call. What about you, Paul ? Did you call Christie ? See that, Jake ? Your trigger finger seemed to be fine. What happened to the one you dial with ? An officer got killed last night, Rebecca. I'm sorry, but it could have been you. She was my friend. I don't know-- I don't know what you expect from me. Nothing. Not anymore. [ Footsteps Approaching ]Hey, princess. How ya doin' ? Mommy said we're going to a festival today. I know. Baby, I'm sorry, but we can't. But you promised !I know. Sometimes things just happen. [ Police Radio, Indistinct ] Jake ! Gotta go. Give Daddy a kiss good-bye, honey. Bye, Dad.Bye, sweetheart. [ Sighs ] I'll call you later. I'm sorry. Bye, Jake. The gas station owner... over on Fifth called in about a couple of guys that fit the description. Bought 10 gallons of gas and $40 worth of bubble gum. [ Engine Revs ] Did it ?What ? What the fuck took you guys so damn long ? Just get to work. You try walkin' five miles, boss woman. Yeah, yeah, come on, man. Got us a real sweet job. Got on the inside. Inside, my ass. This is bone-dry. Einstein, you really think this gum idea is gonna work ?I got ya, Einstein. Hey, hey ! What the hell you doin' ? I'm workin' down here ! Now what ?We wait. For what ?For dark. Don't be stupid, Shi. We go out there now, the cops will bust us. Sometimes I think you forget who's in charge. I'm gonna find these bastards. They're out here somewhere in a 40-block radius. How do you figure that ? Well, the motel is here. Gas station's there. So they're somewhere in between, right ? Jake, they could have gone anywhere after they got the gas. The van hasn't been seen since it left the motel. Our guys were spotted at the gas station three hours after they closed the interstate. Where's the van ? Why would they walk to get the gas instead of just driving there ? Gas leak. Why don't they just dump that vehicle and get a new one ? That's what I'd do. I hear that. Every cop in Phoenix was after me, I'd be out of that thing in a heartbeat. What's so special about that friggin' van ? Anything ? [ Man ] Nah. We're gonna make another turn. Right. Hey, hey, hey, hey ! How do you do it, Paulie ? What's that ?Keep it all together. You and Christie. I don't get it. Christie says she wants to be the most important thing in my life. So I make her the most important thing in my life. It's that simple.Come on. [ Sighs ] Yeah, maybe you're right. So what do you want to do now ? What do you got, partner ? I think I smell a gas leak. Let's take one more pass, for Andrea. You seein' what I'm seein' ?Let's check it out. Be cool. Just wait. You hearin' what I'm hearin' ? Bullet holes. Phone that in, would ya ? You got that. Hey, Sharon, this is 384-- Shoot to thrill. We don't need no more dead cops. Let's do it. Down ! Pull back now ! Get in the van. Let's go ! - Give me my fuckin' gun. - Go, go, go ! Stay on 'em, Jake ! Stay on 'em ! [ Gunfire ] - Drive, Cameron !- We got him ! All right ![ Gunfire ] [ Gunfire ] [ Gunfire ] Give it to me. Take 'em out ! Don't screw this up ! Let's go ! Let's go ! Watch it ! Watch out ! Watch it, Jake ! [ Gunfire ] Hold on ! Come on, guys. Shoot out from the back. [ Horn Honking ] - God-- - Lose 'em ! - [ Horns Honking ] - [ Casing Clatters On Floor ] Do it out the back ! [ Horn Honking ] - [ Horn Honking ] - Watch the cars ! Oh, fuck ! [ Horn Honking ] Hold on ! What are they doin' ? Oh, God ! Come on ! Oh, fuck ! - [ Grunts ] - [ Horn Honking ] - Just hit 'em ! Damn it ! - [ Screams ] What the hell you doin' ? - Get out of the way ! - Out of the way ! [ Growling ] Look out ! - Whoa ! - Oh, man ! Whoa ! [ Paul ] Oh, that's good. We wouldn't wanna forget the siren. - You all right, Paulie ? - Yeah, Jake. Fuckin' great. I'm goin' after them. Police matter. I'm a cop. Got it handled. Stop ! We can't leave the van. The boss will kill us. They fuckin' killed Willdog !We got no choice ! I'm goin' ! Call an ambulance. Call one ! I'll tell you one thing. You ain't drivin' again. Fuckin' kill somebody. Keep up with us, Shi. Stop ! Stop ! Get your ass out of the way. Move your ass now ! Come on, bitch ! Get out of the car !I'm drivin' ! I'm drivin' ! Bitch, get outta the car ![ Whimpers ] Get in ! Get in !Let's go ! Let's go ! Let's go ! Get out of the way ! Down ! We lost the van. We're at the club right now. No, no one followed us. Yes, it's Willdog's fault. And I would put a bullet in his head right now, but, uh, he got killed in the chase. No, I wouldn't worry about it. The way that he looked, no one's gonna be able to I.D. him. I'm sorry, baby. I really am. I'll make it up to you. I swear. I'll make one more run. [ Phone Beeps ][ Engine Off ] So much for a smooth operation. Well, I'm sorry, Julian. I had no idea Peterson had a guy on the inside. You and I have enjoyed a long and profitable relationship. I'd hate to see that end suddenly because of your stupidity. Oh, please, don't threaten me, man ! I got as many guns to your head as you do to mine. That was not a threat, John. But I am curious as to why you chose... to include Captain Peterson in last night's drop-off. By involving Bill I convinced him he's doing me a favor to let our shipment go through. Let me ask you something. You're out there selling your marching powder, right ? On the street. Why are you building drug rehab centers to clean these people up ? Drug rehab centers that I build for profit... are made possible only by the abuse of my merchandise. You got it covered both ways, huh, pally ?Yes. Now suppose you tell me what your plan is to get my merchandise back, because I've leveraged every nickel I have into this shipment, including building a plant right here on the premises... to process said merchandise, so that, of course, I can build our dream. Our dream, huh ?Yeah. Dream ? Well, I'm sorry, Jules. This place looks like a Siberian shithouse to me. Oh, well, that's your problem, John. You have no vision. Lest you forget, some of the profit from this shithole... was to go toward your retirement nest egg. Hmm. On second thought, it's a diamond in the rough. [ Chuckles ]Huh ? [ Laughs ] Now may I suggest you use your position of power... to get them to release that vehicle into your custody ? No, can't do that, Julian. Can't do it, buddy. If I sign for that merchandise, I'm responsible. But I think I've figured out a way to get one of the Petersons to sign for it. I'm listening. All the information right there, buddy. He's got something of mine. I take something of his. We make a trade. I'll talk to you later. I sent her partner out to tell her parents. No, it never is. Say, listen, I want you to call my daughter-in-law. You have the number ? Yeah, tell her I'm sorry I'm late. I'll be there as soon as I can. Have my squad car standing by. Thanks, Janet. I'm pullin' the plug on this, Bill.Say again. I'm sorry, Bill, but I'm pullin' the plug on this. What are you talkin' about ? The agency is scrapping the operation. Over my dead body. I'll call the agency myself. Bill ! I'm the agent in charge, and I'm telling you we're scrapping this operation. Well, you do that, John. But that vehicle was involved with the murder of one of my police officers, and it ain't goin' nowhere till I finish my investigation. Okay, fine, fine. That's the way you want it ? Okay. But I am holding you personally responsible for the contents in that van. I am personally responsible for the contents of that van ! What the hell's the matter with you, John ? You know what this is about. It's about a young cop that lost her life because youinsisted... on goin' off the record for some big drug bust ! Oh, no, no, no, no. Don't guilt trip me, Peterson. No, no ! This is your fuck-up, you and your people. John. If I were you, I would really watch my mouth from now on. [ Man Chattering ]Pappy ! Yeah, Boss ? I want you to lock down this vehicle, and under no circumstances is anyone to touch it until I get back. That clear ?Certainly. Thank you.All right, boys. You heard him. Nobody touches this truck but me. Well, hey, boys. How ya doin' ? Hi, Pappy.What's up, Pappy ? What was that all about ?[ Chuckles ] Your old man is awful interested in this piece of junk. Why's that ? [ Coughs ] Got me. To hear him talk, you'd think the damn thing's made out of gold bullion. Shit will kill ya. Give me that, will ya ? Hey, hadn't hurt me yet. Gold bullion, huh ? There's somethin' in that van worth an awful lot to somebody. We gonna open it up ? [ Water Sloshing ] [ Sighs ] She's finally asleep. Wish I had that much energy. Thanks for comin', Dad.Are you kiddin' ? I couldn't pass up a chance for your home cookin', chance to see my granddaughter. But that's not why you asked me to come here, is it ? I'm asking Jake for a divorce. What ? No, it's not my place. Please, Dad. Tell me what you think. Well, you know I think the world of you, sweetheart. I couldn't love you any more if you were my own daughter. You know Susan felt that way too. God rest her. But, you know, marriage is tough enough as it is. Being married to a cop makes it that much tougher. If you really want out, and you went to him and asked for a divorce, I think he'd probably give it to you, if that's what you really want, but I don't think you do. The only reason any marriage succeeds is because of love. That's the bottom line: love. I could be wrong, but I think you still love him. I know he still loves you. And that's all that really counts in the end. This may be the most important decision you'll ever make. So think about it seriously before you make up your mind. And just for the record, whatever you decide, I won't feel any differently about you. And I'll wash your dishes anytime. Thanks, Dad. ♪ Oh, what'll I do when you ♪♪ You didn't know I could sing, did ya ? I don't care what Pop says. We gotta open this thing up. You boys, uh-- I could lose my job over this. Yeah, and if I'm right, you're a hero. Well, well, and, uh, what if you're wrong ? You're right. You'll lose your job.[ Coughing ] Or a lung. Shut up, you little prick. All right, boys. Let's, uh-- Let's get to work, huh ? Good man, Pap. Good man. Got it. I won't miss this time. [ Phone Beeps, Clicks ] [ Grunts, Sighs ] [ Pappy Coughing ] The van's clean, partner. No, the van is not clean, partner. What do you mean, it's not clean ? Pulled everything out we can pull out, Jake. Gentlemen, we're missing something obviously.Jake, the thing is empty ! All right, uh, let's take it all over again. Pappy, what's the fuel capacity on this thing ? What's this van weigh ? 4,628 pounds.Wrong. Wrong ?Manifest says different. Let's check something out. Jake, look, man, we pulled out just about everything but the gas tank. Can't be the tank. They had a leak. Which tank ? Come on, Jake. The thing only comes with one tank. Well, that's all fine and well, Pappy, but I'm lookin' at two tanks here. [ Knocking On Metal ] For a van without a reserve tank-- [ Grunts, Pants ] It's sure full of something. Yank it out of there, Pappy. [ Gas Hissing ] Well, look at that. [ Indistinct Noise ]Kaylin ? [ Clock Ticking ]Kaylin ? Kaylin ? [ Indistinct Noise ] Kaylin Peterson ? Tsk. Okay, little one, you wanna play hide-and-seek ? [ Door Creaking ] Come out, come out, wherever you are. Mommy !Hi. Hello, Rebecca. Oh, my God !Mm-mmm. Sit down. [ Whimpers ] That is exactly what the fuck I'm talking about ! That's exactly what I'm talkin' about ! It's the same shit, Paulie. - Jake, calm down, man. - I can't calm down ! - Your dad is a good cop, Jake. - Well, so am I. Well, then, give him the benefit of the doubt. Why should I ? Why ? Huh ? Nothing more than a complete and total pain in my ass ! Feeling's mutual, son. Oh, well, looky here. What is this, Pop, huh ? I told you not to let anybody touch the van. Didn't I ? I'm sorry, Captain. You should be ! It's not his fault.I asked you a question, Captain. What is this ? What's it look like ?You tell me ! If it came from that van, it's probably heroin, pure grade. Maybe $50 million street value. Imagine that.Yeah, imagine that. Why didn't you tell me you were part of this operation, huh ? - I couldn't, son. - [ Phone Ringing ] Why ?Because I gave somebody my word. Somebody your word. What about me ? What about me ? You don't trust me ? Jake ! It's about your daughter. Station just called.What's the matter ? We need to get to your house.All right, let's go. You drive.All right. Pappy ! Put this rig back together ! Yeah ! Kaylin, sweetheart. Thank God you're okay. What happened ? Tell me what happened. They took Mommy. Check the perimeter, Paulie.You got it, Captain. Come to Grandpa, sweetheart.Go to Grandpa. I got ya, sweetheart. There you go. Where's my wife ?I don't know. When we arrived at the scene, the only one here was the little girl. - Who called it in ? - Captain, your granddaughter dialed 911. - Good work, darling. - Really ? From what we can tell, it was two or more intruders. From the looks of this room, entrance was this exterior door. Your wife may have heard a noise, come into this room, surprised them. Burglary ? Um, I'm sorry to say that at the moment nothing appears stolen. Kidnapping. [ Phone Rings ] Look, gentlemen, may I remind you this room is hot ! Jake, it's on the bed. [ Ringing Continues ]Where is-- [ Ringing Continues ] Shit ! [ Beeps ]Yeah ? Yeah, who's this ? Uh-huh. Know where it's at ? Yes, I do. Oh, really ? You lay one hand on my wife, I swear to G-- [ Phone Beeps ]When's Mommy coming home ? Soon, sweetheart. They want to trade. Sorry, Rebecca. Your husband said no deal and that we should go ahead and kill you. That's not true. Jake would never say that. - [ Chuckles ] - You're right, Rebecca. I just needed some comic relief after the last couple of days. Why are you doing this to me ? Do you realize in just a few short days your husband has managed to ruin my entire life ? So it's only fair that I ruin his. You're never gonna get away with this. Jake's gonna find you, and he's gonna blow your fucking head off. That's not very nice talk, especially coming from a cop's wife. Besides, can't be all that bad. Could have killed your daughter. - It's ready. - What's ready ? Shi, I say the hell with this ! Five-O surrounds this place we're screwed. If we don't deliver the boss's merchandise by tomorrow morning, we're not only screwed, we're dead. Killin' cops ? Kidnappin' cop's wife ? This wasn't part of the deal. You know what ? I say we walk away. Let some other fools recover Disanto's merchandise. Oh, my God. Now I'm gonna have to kill her, and after he shows you the merchandise, you're gonna kill him. If he doesn't see his old lady, he's not gonna give us the dope. I'll make sure he sees her. And after that, me and Mrs. Peterson are gonna take a ride out to the drop site. You better work that cop hard and bring his beaten body to me. I can't imagine Rebecca not wanting to be buried next to her husband. [ Door Opens ] [ Door Closes ]Oh, God. You're so beautiful, Rebecca. I hate to waste you. Finally, we're alone. God, you smell good, Rebecca. - Let's party. - Aah ! All set, Pappy ? Heroin and all the weapons you ordered are in the van. Jake and Paulie are waitin' for ya.Good deal. You bring it back, Boss. Don't worry. We're gonna nail those bastards. ♪♪ [ Alternative Rock ] [ Chattering ] Rebecca !Come on, pig. Follow me, you stupid ass. Come on. [ Beeping ] Everybody out now !Yes, sir. This one's for me. This one's for my boy, Willdog. Where are the keys, asshole ? Close by. - Where's that ? - My ass. Come on, guys. You're takin' too much time. Get out of the way. Rebecca ! Son of a bitch ! Nice backup, partner. [ Laughs ] You brought it. I can't believe they actually brought the shit. Shi's plan worked, man. You are two of the stupidest motherfuckin' cops I've ever seen. That makes three of us, gentlemen. Turn around real slow. Now, tell me where we're goin'. I don't fuckin' remember. All right, let's stick to the plan, fellas. Now, you having any change of heart ? [ Rebecca ] You have no intention of letting me live. A simple shipment, Rebecca. All your husband had to do was to let it go through. You see, Officer Peterson has something of mine that I greatly desire. And now, I have something of his... that I'm sure he greatly desires. Everything under control ? - Yeah, man, w-we're cool. - Okay, they're waitin' for you upstairs. Yeah.Shi, they're on their way up now. - Got it. - [ Sighs ] Hey, Steve, what are you tryin' to do, break my balls or what ? You guys know the rules. But every time you come here I gotta tell ya the same fuckin' thing. There's no smokin' inside. - Now get this guy upstairs. - Yeah, whatever, man. Let 'em by, Mr. Singer. Now what ?Here's what. No more, red. Sit still. Act natural. See all that ?Yeah, I see it. You bad guys got some pretty cool toys to play with, don't you ? Yeah, we got some pretty cool toys to play with.Yes, you do. Well, you're playin' by my rules now. - Where's my wife ? - She's close by. - How close ? - She's upstairs, next to the lab. Good man. Good man. I think I owe you something. No, Jake ! - Don't take it personal, man. - It's already personal. Come on, son. Stick to the plan. Quickly. Put your arm behind your head. Come on, man. Paulie, give us the keys. Come on, Rebecca. The guns, man. The shit in these barrels is a motherfucker. Shut up.He's not kiddin' around. You shut the fuck up too. He dead ?Counting sheep. Let's go. - Oh, my God. - You're screwed, Jake. - Rebecca. - Jake, are you okay ? Is Kaylin ? - What have they done to you ? - Nothing she didn't seem to enjoy. I've done what you asked. Let her go. You shouldn't have come here. They're gonna kill us both. That what they told ya ? [ Scoffs ] Officer Jacob Peterson. Nothing more tragic than a man who's been robbed of his dignity. Well, well, well, Disanto. Yes. I do wish we could have met under different terms, but you and your father... have caused me some serious problems. Good job. I assume the rest is still in the van ? And you've cost my operation... a great deal of time and money. Maybe you should let Rebecca and I walk out of here and you can get back to business. [ Chuckles ] Oh, how I wish it could be that easy, Jake, but, uh, you complicated things immensely by seizing my merchandise. - Can't even call it by its name, can ya ? - People are weak, Jake. [ Disanto ] Personally I never touch the stuff. To me, it's just a business. Someone in this world is gonna make a profit. Might as well be me. How'd you know where to find me ? It's always nice to have friends in high places. Now if you would be kind enough to give me the key to the van, I promise I'll make your departure quick and painless. I've got the key, Mr. Disanto. Give it here. I need to tell you something. Not now. Just give me the key. - [ Rebecca Gasps ] - Police ! Freeze ! - Oh, shit ! - Kill 'em ! Game's over, Disanto. Let her go. Fuck. Jake. What makes you think you have the upper hand ? Fact that I have my gun leveled on a man with a grenade, and this whole place is filled with enough chemicals to blow us all to hell. I think, yes, I have the upper hand. We all live. We all die. You make the call. Release her. Fuck you ! I've got you covered ! [ Rapid Gunfire ] - [ Clicks ] - [ Whimpers ] - Shit ! Fire in the hole ! [ Screaming ] Get outta here !Go ! [ Gunfire ] Let's go ! Let's go ! [ Gunfire ] [ Grunts ] - Come on ! - Jake, get us out of here ! Come on ! Get outta my way ! Where'd you learn to do that ? Me. Move it. Move it !Go, go, go ! [ Engine Sputters, Starts ] Goddamn it ! Die ! Die ! Dad ! [ Explosion ] [ Engine Starts ] [ Tires Screeching ] Aaah ! Go ! Stay down ! [ Groaning ] I love you. Not likely anyone's gonna survive that. You okay ? [ Siren Wailing ] Congratulations, Bill. You mind telling me how long you were on Disanto's payroll ? What are you talkin' about ?How long, John ? Or better yet, why ?Ooh ! That's a hell of an accusation for a man about to retire. Is it ? I spoke to your secretary, and she confirmed that you recently had her pull up my son's personnel record. Yeah ? So what ? So I find it interesting that Disanto had that same... said personnel record in his possession when we took him down. Look familiar, John ? [ Scoffs ] Bill, you got nothin'. You got nothin'. Nothing ? Huh ? Nothing ? Is that why you left me in possession of the van, John, knowing that when they kidnapped Rebecca, I would sign off on it, making me responsible, so I could take the fall ? Is that it, John ? [ Sighs ] Bill, look. Disanto was a facilitator. He kept the drug wars in the ghetto where they belong. You know every gangbanger with a beeper is out there carvin' a territory out for himself. Man, I got sick watchin' these pricks get rich on money I could have been makin'. Come on, Bill. I mean, we've got to look out for ourselves. A little retirement nest egg. You know, a little insurance for the future. How's the future look without Disanto, John ? [ Laughs ] Not too bad. [ Laughs ] Well, look. [ Sighs ] There's a lot of cash out there, Bill. - A lot ? - Enough for all of us. Yeah ? Keep your mouth shut... and take your retirement. I can guarantee you a little insurance for yourself, Bill, and you deserve it. What do ya say ? I don't know, old buddy. 'Cause, you see, I think I've got...[ Clicks ] about all the insurance I'm ever gonna need. Oh, Bill, don't be a fool. Don't be a fool, Bill. Bill Peterson, come back here ! Bill ! Peterson, you're a dead man now. Thanks for your help.I'm tellin' ya ! Come back ! Peterson ! Attention all hands. This is the captain. Now hear this. I say again, now hear this. Keep your mouth shut and take your retirement. I can guarantee you a little insurance for yourself, Bill, and you deserve it. [ Clicks ]Take him down, Paulie. Yes, sir, Captain.Give 'em hell, Paulie.
