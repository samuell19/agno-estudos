One more thing! Rome is not built in a day! Just like Rome took a long time to build Don't give up after just once. Keep on trying and you'll get the gal, boy. You want one more tip or not? This is what a donut guy said to a girl he likes. "There is no nut in my donuts and no love in my life without you." Donuts... Impossible! It's over if you tell her you're an iron box. Noodle guys and college girls don't work. That's like a wandering warrior wooing a noble lady. Caterpillars eat pine needles and iron boxes eat hair dressers. If I'm a caterpillar Ye-rin is my pine tree. You came to our room for 80 cents? You scared me. I thought you were Robocop. 80 cents, right? Geez. Ye-rin, do you have 60 cents? I only have 20 cents.

Ye-rin! SUH Ye-rin! I love you! I love you! I love you more! Birthday party. Central library. LET'S BE REALISTIC, LET'S DREAM THE IMPOSSIBLE Che Guevara I have no time to read books. What's the use in pretending to be Bruce Lee? You should read some time. Che Guevara led the Cuban Revolution with Castro. It's his quote, dummy. Realist means to see reality clearly and to dream impossible means revolution. Revolution makes the impossible, possible. Shit, man! Where's my pickled radish? Become a realist! Bring more radish when you come to me! Okay. Where you going? Slice this up! Side! Back! No, no! - Where the hell is Dae-oh? - I don't know. Maybe we have no customers cuz it's so hot in here.

We're going to take over this building for a sit-in. We'd like all the staff to proceed to outside quickly. Please leave. It's okay, guys. Calm down. - Get going. - Calm down. Okay! Okay! Easy now! Let's take the furniture and make the barricade. Let's go! get off the books first Marching! Marching! Shoot! How do I get out? Let's see. Help! Help me! Help me! I'm dying here! Help! Is he dead? One, two! What is he? Who are you? I'm here for the birthday party. But this isn't a party. So I'll just... What are you? You know... You don't seem to know anything cuz you're all just bookworms. This barricade sucks! Look how dangerous it is! You can't even call this a barricade. If you put heavy things at the top, this barricade will kill you! Things have to be tangled up. And heavy things at the bottom! He's a barricade expert! You work on the barricade then. Let's go back up, guys. Yeah, let's go back up. - Let's go. - Let's hurry. Withdraw US support for Korean dictatorship! Withdraw! Withdraw! Oppressive military government must resign! Resign! Resign! Respect the people's right to live! Respect! Respect! Down with dictatorship! We want democracy! Stand firm! Stand firm! - Help us set up. - What? Setting! Setting! Setting! Setting! The spoiled little brats. We're waiting for the permission from the US embassy as the sit-in is at a US territory. We love our fellow patriotic people. We also support the US love for freedom and democracy. We're here to protest the US support for Korean military dictatorship government. And to proclaim the injustice of Korean government to the people all over the world. You need to clarify the US economic imperialism. I thought that was for next time. When? After being totally absorbed into US economy? People need to know the dangers of US economic neocolonialist. What is neocolonialism? - Didn't you learn that in your team? - Team? Activism study group. I'm just a freshman. - Lucky you. - Sorry? Neocolonialism means to become subordinate economically rather than politically. I've heard of Japanese colonialism. - That was at the beginning of 20th century. - I see. Simply put, the pits of neocolonialism and colonialism... Pizza? Is pizza connected to neocolonialism? - Hamburger too? - Hamburger? Pizza? Are we driving away pizzas and hamburger for democracy? - Well, um... - Let's put it this way. Protecting black bean noodles is democracy. - What? - isn’t it? - I mean... - Right? - Hold on. - Right? Let's put this in very simple words. The philosophical and political relationship is exposed between hamburger and noodles. How do we solve the dialectical sublation between large noodles and fried pork? And all this antagonism between them? Antagonism! What the hell you on about? Shut up! - Easy, huh? - Yes. My name is HAN Gil-soo. And my name is Young-shin SO. How do you do? I'm fine too. Nice to meet you. Me too. The ambassador is concerned this incident could spark anti-American sentiment in Korea. These people are terrorists. Their occupation of the building was not violent. They invaded our territory, and they must be stopped. Okay, okay. Easy, easy. Now, if your police can't stop this Then we'll bring in the world's best. The US Marines. The White Skeleton Police are already here. Sergeant JANG? - Are we fighting today? - Yeah. Be careful. Do I have to beat people up? Isn't that better than getting beat up? This is your first, and my last. All meet! Let's get this over with. THE SACK OF DEMOCRACY My mom got this charm from a monk at Gwangdeok Temple. This has protected me from the cops until now. My ex promised me eternal love with this four-leaf clover. Our love wasn't eternal. But I'd rather our democracy be. I'm wearing a jacket and tie cuz I don't have a suit. I guess my disguise worked cuz I never got inspected. My name is PARK Nam-jeong from Seoul National University. Hi. Oh, yeah! Da-ni-na! Sorry. I'm sorry. I just love singing so much. I'm known as the Elvis Presley of activist music. My name is HWANG Young-min from Chungnam University. This is my a flower card, my guitar pick. Ace of Hearts. Hope it brings us democracy. Coming to university I realized that the world is different from what I thought. I went through a period of turbulence and confusion. Then I found this one day. It gave me a sense of security. That's how I got here and I'm not gonna lose my way again. Let's zap the cops. My name is YOOK Jung-yeop, the impeccable cop-zapper. So I'm... So I'm... I don't have anything to show. Show something most precious to you. Just wait. This one dollar bill. It brought me to this revolution. You look familiar. What university you from? From Chunghwaru. Chungang University? Right. Here. What department? Mainly English. I'm just a freshman so l' don't know. Clap! Thank you! Cops are here! Let's go! Charge! 14:37 MAY 23 First police Repression I think this'll work. Like that! To the front-line! Push forwards, guys! - Hye-wook! - Kyoung-dal! Why're you here? Don't back up! Ye-rin! Let's go! Defend your positions! The flying birds know it. They know everything. Why we need a hero in revolution. Nice going, man! Stand firm! Stand firm! Like the tree rooted by the stream. Stand firm! Stand firm! Like the tree rooted by the stream. One! Two! What's with your posture? Didn't you see them soldiers swirling their things? You wanna get your skull cracked? Relax your arms! Lift your chin! On guard! Fire in the eyes! - One! - One! Good! - One! - Yap! - Louder! - Yap! You're all just bookworms, aren't you? Yap! Look. Not so hard! Hold it like a cotton ball! Like an anti-neocolonialism democratic! Like Bruce Lee in Japanese colonialism! Now you get neocolonialism? - One! - Yap! - Two! - Yap! Good! Now, on your target! - Attack! - Yap! - Setting! Setting! - Setting! Setting! WE ARE UNIVERSlTY STUDENTS WHO LOVE DEMOCRACY - Emergency food. - Sorry? It's good. It's in my nose. I'm full. Police batons hurt, huh? You should've said that it hurts. Why didn't you say anything? Hold still. What's that? Lucky triangle. It'll keep you safe. Do you have a boyfriend? You? I asked you first. You know KANG Mun-mo? The president of the association. The Robin Hood who wins over police. - He's your boyfriend? - No. I want someone as brave as him. He's a real fighter, who's also level-headed. And he's so charismatic. Now answer my question. I don't have a girlfriend either. Freshman students are always having blind dates. Or you like someone already? Have you confessed to her yet? Not yet. I don't know how to. What kind of girl is she? - She's an activist. - Oh, an activist girl! Will you be my companion in this military fascist neocolonialism? Something like that? You're done. Did we put antiseptic on you? Will you be my companion in this military fascist neocolonialism? That's good. Keep that expression. What do you want to do for your girlfriend? There's not much I can do for her. I wanted to give her a dragonfly hair pin. It'd look good on her. Dragonfly hair pin? Guess she's got long hair. What else? You know when people say good night and the girl gets on the bus and the guy runs after her, waving and drawing hearts? That's so childish. No, it's not. I'll show you. Pretend you're my girl. You've gotten on the bus. The bus has left. Vroom. Bye! But I miss you so much already. I run. It'll come out when the light passes. See? It works, right? It's cut off. Wonder if there's a manual. Here. It's in English. I see. There's a problem inside. - The problem is... - I don't think so. It says "copy this way..." Look KANG Dae-oh. When you pass flyers, use the flow of air. That's lame! Look! The paper goes in your right hand. But you should throw it more like this. And this pretty little hand should be up and open. Like this. What you looking at? Look ahead. Lift your leg as high as possible. Nice posture! Go up! Very nice! But your weight can't be on this leg. It should be on your left leg. Don't move. Then you shift your weight to your right foot Stick in your bum, Your back is straight, Then chuck the paper with your wrist. Like this! Let's try. Ready? Go! Draw your energy, and hand wind! The people and democracy. Good. What's this, sir? - Attack! - Attack! 17:22, MAY 23 2ND OPERATION: LADDER ATTACK Push them off! One, two! - Push them all off! - Throw the stones! Get inside! Ye-rin! Attack! Don't climb up! Or I'll jump. Don't come! I swear I'll jump! I'll jump! Don't come up! Ready the matt and net. Don't climb up! You! We have potassium cyanide! I'll drop this if you come any closer! I repeat! We have potassium cyanide! I'll drop this if you come any closer! Don't stop! Attack! Ignore them! No, we can't let anyone be hurt on our property. I'm waiting for the ambassador's call. Stop! Stop! Fuck! Damn it! Damn it! One, two, three! It looks like they're having a pretty serious discussion here. What's wrong with this? Tom, what did you do when you were in college? Played football. Why? What did you do? I sang guitar, sang folk songs, protested against the Vietnam War. This reminds me of those days. Oh, the good old days, huh? Protests...riots... Why would you waste your youth on something like that? Man, I don't get it. I mean, don't you think the whole point of being young Oh, that's poetic? What a load of crap. It's been long since I've forgotten you. It's been long since I've left you. With a faintly burning heart The memories of longing write your name in silence. With thirsting longing With thirsting longing We cry for democracy! The fresh memories of freedom The memories of our blood-stained friends being dragged away With trembling heart and hands, With trembling anger We write clumsily in chalk. With thirsting longing With thirsting longing We cry for democracy! The dark age of death We gnash at the darkness all night In the deep black night - Defeat the dark - Shedding tears every night Farewell to this night Dark night. - The night of pain and suffering - Dark night, cold night! - Night, night. - Thirsty night The deep night and darkness - Darkness! - Night of history! Darkness frightens me tonight. Dark! Dark! Dark! Our days of love are now in darkness. Dark! Dark! Dark! Are we strangers now? So dark in here. You know this song? Night! Night! Night! Our dreamy past disappears into fog The night bird cries! Night! Darkness! I'm sorry. president! Come out! Nice to meet you. I'm the director of the cultural center. I'm the councilor of the US embassy. We all are Korean students. College students... Look, my ambassador would like you guys to leave this building right now. We don't want any more trouble here. We can’t. We wants. Wait, not third-person singular. Want America hate Korean government. Good. I don't think you fully understand the gravity of the situation, here. We're not asking. We're ordering you to get the hell off the American property right now. - What's he saying? - I don't know. Guys, this is not a Friday night campus party. You've invaded US territory. Where's your English, smarty pants? Hi. Hello. Nice... Feuerbach. petit bourgeois. American imperialism. Korean democracy. Revolution. Capitalism. What time is it now? Come on, baby? I'm sorry. I'm okay. Any English majors? He's English major from Chungang University. Yeah! He said he was! Wait. Rome is not built in a day. What? Rome was not built in a day? How long do you think you guys can stay in here? Forever? One phone call, and I'm calling the US marines. The air force. Is this really what you want? The brave get a beauty. The brave get the beauty? Yes. But you've already demonstrated your bravery here. Beyond any doubt. And besides, this isn't a question about picking up girls. This is a diplomatic problem with real life implications for US-Korea ties. To be or not to be, that is the question. To be or not to be, that is the question? - Question! - That's it, God damn it! I've had enough. You wanna make this a matter of life or death, we can happily oblige. And you will regret those words. Andre, let's go. There's no point talking to these people. These are extreme and dangerous terrorists. If they wanna start talking about life or death again. then we have nothing more to say. Chief KlM, if you're done, I'm gonna go. You didn't clean the plate. Who wrote these rebellious words here? Dae-oh? I dunno. Was it me or him? Hey! Has Dae-oh ever called the government a dictatorship? Dick? What is dictatorship? Dictator means one person. Ship... A boat. It means you sail alone. Then everyone's a dictator. We all sail alone. You're wrong. If everyone can sail, that would be democracy. If only one can sail alone that is dictatorship. A-ha! Dictator sails alone. You know what undercover spies want? Undercover spies? What undercover college kids do. Like the lron Box Association. Didn't you find anything strange about Dae-oh? Well, he was after some college girl. College girl? That means he's already working as a group. - What's he doing out right now? - Revolution! That's hardcore! If Dae-oh was really an undercover spy, why would he choose iron box? HWANG! This isn't as simple as you think. Sit. Imagine black bean noodles disappear all of a sudden. What? What would people eat on graduation day? What would soldiers eat on their holidays? They'd go crazy! - They would! - Right? You know the social outcasts at billiards? Yeah? Imagine there is no more black bean noodles for them! This would stir monstrous social anxiety. This text incites that. NO MORE JUNGHWARU MEANS BAD ECONOMY - You know what college girls signify? - Sorry? Social class. Why can some sleep with them and some can't? The bastard was after a college girl for social class! That's right! Then he probably mentioned labor conditions. - Labor conditions? - Right. How many hours a day do you work? Usually from 10 am to 10 pm. See? There is something called the Labor Standards Act. According to that, no one should work more than 8 hours a day. - How about paid-leaves? - What's that? All this makes you feel discontent about the society. Why? Cuz they need naive but strong people like you in a revolution. Let's go back. What's a paid-leave? Huh? He said dating a college girl has to do with class difference. Dae-oh said, "isn’t it unfair you couldn't go to college cuz your parents are poor?" He said that I have a folksy face. He said he wanted to kill people who feed noodles to dogs. Really, who wouldn't wanna sleep with a college girl? Is it bad to wanna sleep with a college girl? No, but sleeping with a college girl to go up class means revolution. Guys. Do you know what paid-leave is? You mean tea leaves? Get out. Will you be my companion in this military fascist neocolonialism? Will you be companion? You said you'll fight for labor movement. I told you there's more work in the field. It's time to put our thoughts to actual politics. They want me there. What is activism if you become a politician? And everything we dreamt for together? That hasn't changed. We make them come true in reality. You said we can't change the world if we don't get to the people. Don't fall into sentimentality and heroism. That's better than copping out. Wake up, Ye-rin! Revolution is reality. Let's work out reality together. Will you be my companion in this military fascist neocolonialism? You think revolution guarantees love? No. Love guarantees revolution. Aren't you hungry? Want this last potassium cyanide? What's wrong, KANG? Darkness frightens me tonight. The cruel night bird sounds melancholic. Wait. So you’re saying we only have two from Chonnam University? That's right. There are supposed to be three. Where is the last one? Well, it's a bit hard to explain. So came to Seoul in our friends' patriotic farewell. March on in the cold morning frost! We were more determined than student soldiers at Korean War. He was with me til we got here. I don't know why he couldn't get in. Birthday Party! Birthday Party! Where? Damn! Thirty-four. Thirty-five. The number's right. That means we got a spy among us? Spy? You mean undercover cop? Who knew Mr. YOOK before coming here? Me! We didn't go to same school but met and worked at a coalition. Stand to the right, Mr. YOOK. My name is KlM Jun-chul. I invited him. We went to same high school. Sung-jae was the president of our department. Jae-sang helped me at the Gwanghwamun riot. Dong-sik and I have been comrades since kindergarten. Down with the teacher, We want healthy snacks! You three have not been verified by anyone. Mr. SUNG, when did you get involved in activism? Since I was a freshman, in Classics group. You remember the reading list? The Turning Point, Dominant and Reason, Squae by Choi ln-hoon, Handbook on Philosophy, open documents based on thesis by Feuerbach and other secret documents of Pedagogy. Mr. HWANG, I've never seen you at coalition concerts. That's cuz I look different when I'm performing. It's true! I seem clumsy and slack but I get more serious when I'm singing. Not really. And you look more like a night stage singer than an activist singer. That's my style. Leave my style out of this. And you look more like a real estate agent. Let's leave style out of this. This is crazy! How could I be a spy? All I've done for the last four years is sing and throw firebombs. I climbed and sung on the statue of Yl Sun-shin Admiral in riots and broke through police barricade with a bus! How can I be a spy, damn it! - Damn it? - Watch your tongue. That was to myself. What's AlFDF? Anti-American Independence, Anti-fascist Democracy Fighters AlFPDF? Anti-lmperialist Anti-Fascist People's Democracy Fighters PUlFA? People's Unification, Independence and Freedom Association Cops took me for a field trip for spraying blood at agitprop and family tells me to dig from LEE to CHUN. The cops arrested me for passing flyers at a riot and friends tell me to study from President LEE to CHUN. You said you were a freshman? Yes. Who's your professor? Mr. St. Phillips. He's American. What courses are you taking? English. Student activists don't know their own subjects. Their friends register for them. I went to class only once last year. Had nowhere else to go. Quiet. How did you get involved this time? I happened to hear about it. - From whom? - Dunno. It just said 'Birthday Party'. It's easy. Listen carefully. Protest in gatherings. Don't throw flowers at Romans but tow them with petite beans. Explain. So... You ordered small bean soup but your car got towed. And you got a ticket. How much was it? He's just a freshman. He wouldn't know our slang yet. Who's your activism family? Family? My family comes from Gangwon Province. We're the KANG clan. Do you know SOHN Dong-hyuck, English major in second year? Yes. Number 84 Dong-hyuck? We're close. I'm number 83. Cuz I'm short. And Geum-bo was number 88. What? - You're a spy, right? - No. There is no SOHN Dong-hyuck in English department at your college. I made that up. Then maybe it was PARK Dong-hyuck. You bastard! He's a spy! - You're fake! Come here, you! - Come here, you little! English department! Rome is not built in a day! KANG Mun-mo, the student president, is involved in the sit-in. Wait! Wait! Move! - Wait! - What? Lift your head. I'm not a spy. I swear! It's KANG Mun-mo! Excellent at disguising himself, KANG has fooled the police every time. - I knew you looked familiar. - Wait! It's him! Question! Question! It's KANG Mun-mo! He would never reveal himself to the end. I knew it was him. No! No! No! No! No! No! No! Wait! No way! No! No! That picture's from... I want someone as brave as KANG Mun-mo. That's right. I'm KANG Mun-mo! Greeting you at the birthday party. I'm here to make possible the impossible. I love the people, and college students love me. We love you, KANG Mun-mo! KANG Mun-mo! KANG Mun-mo! I thirst! I thirst! I thirst for democracy! - Hooray! - Hooray! - Darkness! - Darkness! - Night! - Night! Wait. Down with the people-exploiting military dictatorship! This is KANG Mun-mo, the president of National Students Association. I'm here to fight with you after a year of being chase. I disguised myself as HWANG from Chungnam University so that I can protect the leaders by confusing the police. I am KANG Mun-mo. What the hell? For last one year while I paced the cold streets staying low from the cops I have never forgotten the sufferings of people and the fighting students! For the last seven years! For him, it was only a year! I rode my scooter in the wind staying low from Chief KlM. And I have never forgotten my fellow hungry students And the delivery boys who work hard for them! Not even for a moment! What? What? Excuse me. I'm a huge fan of KANG Mun-mo. Can I have the autograph of the right KANG Mun-mo? Here. Look. That's him! That was me three years ago, in Gwanghamun riot. Look. That's not you. Right? Not sure. I disguised myself to escape the police. I wore contacts instead of glasses. I also lost 10 kilograms. I know the truth. Is it him? It looks like him. He led me in my first year. This is KANG Mun-mo, the student president. KANG Mun-mo! Unite all students! Defeat the military dictatorship! - He's the spy! Get him! - Get him! How dare you fool us? Name! Affiliation! Name is KANG Dae-oh. Iron Box boy from Chunghwaru Restaurant. I'm not a spy. I think he's a highly-trained special police. He'll never admit himself. Let's come back to it later. We must hear his confession. The police has failed to repress the sit-in led by KANG Mun-mo the president of the national student association. Using student activist slang through the camera KANG Mun-mo has been delivering a message to the students nationwide. Soup and noodles! Thunderbolts to American house! Soup and noodles! Thunderbolts to American house! Overthrow Fascism! The intelligence agency is examining the code "Soup and Noodles". Soup and noodles. Excuse me! Wait! Hold back! I'm just here to get my shield. - Kyoung-dal! - Give me back my shield! Or I'll be sent to guardhouse! You never came back for me. But you come back for your shield? I never left you. I had to go to army so I could be with you. Then why disappear without a call? I couldn't ask you to wait for me. It was hard for me too. I never said it, but I showed you how I feel about you at that hotel room. Shut up, man! There! Take your shield. I'm sorry to disturb you. Good luck to your fight for democracy. Hye-sook. I didn't want to be a riot police. I was transferred. This is Geneva Convention's treatment of POW. It's not potassium cyanide. Eat it. I thought spies were scary-looking with horns on their heads. You're not as bad as I thought. I don't care if you're a college student, spy or KANG Mun-mo. You're trash for all your lies. Like the sauce on the noodles my heart is melting over a girl. When you mix the sauce and noodles, it becomes a bowl of love. The cucumber and peas are seasoning of love. I'm sorry I didn't seem happy to see you. I thought that maybe you left cuz of my irresponsible personality. Why didn't you meet a nice girl instead of becoming a riot police? Was it because you hated me a student-activist? I remember everything. The forsythia when I first met you. The roses on the stone wall where we drank and threw up together The beautiful early-summer Acacia trees on the hill to my house. My high school teacher once said "It's love when seasons look beautiful." You asked why I fight it I loved you? Kyoung-dal, I don't fight to fix the world. I fight so that I don 't add to this wrong world. Better days will come. Keep alive until then and fight on. I love you. You damn spy! You okay? Who you with? Chunghwaru. I'm from 47th police squad. I had to go to college for a year to get in here. Where you from? Really. Chinese Restaurant. You're really hardcore. You can tell me, man. Where's your base? I told you. Chunghwaru Chinese Restaurant. Look. We're same team. I hate wigs. Isn't it stuffy? Take it off. My sideburns! Is it real? You really grew your hair! Do they not wear wigs these days? Come here. You know KANG Mun-mo is here, right? We're promoted if we catch him. Let's do it together. Okay? Student sit-in has lasted for over a day. The students are demanding US stop their support for Korean government Failing to catch KANG Mun-mo right in front of their eyes every time, The police stationed 5 riot police stations near the cultural center in determination to catch KANG. The martial arts Black Skeleton police will also be brought in. The police have cut water supply and inflow of food to break-up the protest. - United lron Boxes! - United lron Boxes! Charge! - Attack! - Fire! Charge! Defense! Charge! Who are you? Noodle delivery. What? Who ordered? Our customers there. Hurry! We're hungry! No food! Let them starve. They'll come crawling soon enough. Sir, I don't know about that Yankee. But this is my job, and I'm desperate. I can't let my noodles get cold. Stop them! We're delivery people! Deliver on time! Pickled radish in vinegar! Dumplings for free! Look here! We have your undercover cop! If you don't let them in, we'll drop him! Do we have our men in there? Yes, one undercover from base 47. It'll be a national embarrassment if he falls. We'd be busted. Look at the reporters. Don't let them kill him! I won't let this happen on US property. Let them in. Let the iron boxes in.
