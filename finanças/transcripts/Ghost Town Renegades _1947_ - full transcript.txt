Go down there about fifty yards. You never miss, do you, flynt? Most times, waco, you don't get a second chance at missin'. This one's done for. So is this one-- what do we do with the bodies? Get rid of 'em the usual way? Yeah, the usual way. What about all this stuff? That goes with 'em. And we'd better get rid of the horses, before somebody starts investigating. I heard you were looking for me, Mr. Jennings. Looking for you? I had out a dragnet. I found out how slippery the Cheyenne kid is. My office traced you from laredo to gila bend, then-- well, here I am in Phoenix. What do you want, chief? A job has come up only you can handle. Me as the Cheyenne kid, or as marshal Davis? It'll probably take a combination of both. I don't know whether you've heard-- Bob Craig, a federal surveyor, and his assistant have disappeared. Isn't he mapping the new road through barton county? He was until a couple of weeks ago. One of our marshals traced him to a spot near the ghost town of waterhole, but the trail ended in thin air. Who's on the case? A funny old codger named Jones. Fuzzy Jones? Yes. He's an old sidekick of mine. Good, you'll be working together. Fuzzy reports there may be something big back of Craig's disappearance-- that's where you come in. You can keep the paperwork. I'd rather depend on firsthand information from fuzzy himself. You can contact him in the vicinity of waterhole. He's posing as a desert rat prospecting in that district. That desert rat's gettin' too nosy for his own good. Maybe we'd better scare him off. That oughta be easy. What are you doing around here? Prospectin'. What's that contraption you got there? That's a whatchamacallit. A whatchamacallit? Yeah, it's for locatin' valuable treasures and veins of ore. You're loco. There ain't been any gold around here for fifty years. Maybe you're right, and maybe you're wrong. I figured they must have missed the mother lode when they were minin' hearabouts. Besides, gold ain't the only valuable metal. That thing will locate other metals besides gold? Ha ha! You can't prove it by me, mister, but that's what the inventor told me when he sold me this gadget. I can tell you better after I find somethin'. I think it'd be healthier if you did your prospecting someplace else. This is a free country. Besides, I kinda like it here. I said get going! Ha ha ha! Ha ha! That oughta keep him out of our way for a while. At least by the time he gets his nerve back, our deal will be set. We'd better get back to barton city. Hey, flynt! Wait a minute! What's up, Vance? I just got another answer to those advertisements I've been running in the eastern newspapers. One of the heirs to the waterhole mining property? Rodney Trent--the big fish I've been angling for. His grandfather owned two-thirds of waterhole when the mine was running full blast-- Trent inherited it. You get the deed to his property, that'll just about sew things up for you. Yes, and he fell for my come-on. He's headed out here to investigate. ( Gunshots ) It's Rodney Trent, all right. We'd better get his body to waterhole and put it with the rest of 'em. Reach for it. Cheyenne, you old son of a sidewinder! How are ya, fuzzy? Am I glad to see you! I really been havin' trouble. You're not the only one-- hand me that canteen. This fella's in pretty bad shape. Who are you? Take is easy. The bandits-- what happened? They hightailed it out of here. I've got to get to barton city. Your wound will have to be taken care of first. I've got to get there. Is there someplace close we can doctor his wound? I've been hiding out in an old shack near hear. Good, let's go. I don't know of any reason why those men attacked me. I was carrying very little money. It didn't have the earmarks of an ordinary holdup. You said you answered an ad that was seeking to locate heirs of the waterhole property. Did you write a letter to Vance sharp in barton city, saying you were coming here? Yes. I wrote him that I wanted to look over the land before selling. You don't think Vance sharp had me ambushed, do you? He seems to be the only one you contacted. Do you think his offer to buy your property was legitimate? The figure seemed low. Sharp claimed the land was worthless except to an eastern syndicate which wanted to develop it into small ranches. Ranches? What in tarnation would they use for water? Waterhole was named because the town has the only spring in that section, and that's gone dry. Is there a possibility of a new gold strike? I don't know. But it's sure someone wants that property for something else besides farming. And bad enough to commit murder to get it. What could they gain by my death? I've signed no papers-- you wrote him a letter-- he has your signature. Names are sometimes forged, if there are no heirs to contest the signature. But I have an heir-- my daughter. I'm to meet her in barton city. And from the reception I got, I'm worried about her. Does anybody else know she's coming besides you? Those men who ambushed me have her letter. It was in my wallet. Take it easy. I've got to get to Diane. Don't worry--we'll see that nothing happens to her. We'd better head for barton city, fuzzy. What happened? We ran into some trouble-- and Trent got away? We got him, but before we could get rid of the body the Cheyenne kid jumped US. The Cheyenne kid? Are you sure? I've bumped into him before-- he's a bad hombre to tangle with. Any chance he might have been following Trent? It looked as if he just happened along by accident. I got all of Trent's papers here. Good. Now, nobody will be able to identify him. Well, this changes things-- a letter from Trent's daughter. She'll be arriving in barton city in a few days. So there's still an heir to the Trent property. As long as she remains alive. Too bad miss Trent won't be able to enjoy the millions we're going to mine at waterhole. I'd better get over to the assay office and tell Watson to hold off for a couple of days. You boys come along. Wait here. Hey, Watson. You'll have to hold off recording that Trent deed. What's the matter, Vance? Didn't your sucker arrive on schedule to investigate his property? That part went off like clockwork. But we've got a complication-- Trent has a daughter. You mean we have to get her out of the way before we can get the Trent property. Obviously--if anyone squawks about our claims, those deeds won't bear too close an examination. I won't stand for any more killings-- you're getting US in too deep! We're up to our necks now, Watson, they can only hang US once. But all I've done was to forge those deeds for you, the rest was your responsibility. You still want your share of the millions? I've got a right to a big share-- it was my idea. You tipped me off when the surveyor brought some ore samples to be assayed-- without me it it wouldn't be worth a plugged nickel. I've got enough worries without your troubles, and I don't like the Cheyenne kid showing up at this stage of the game. Knowing what happened to Trent, I'm afraid Bob Craig stumbled onto something and got the same treatment. Do you think Trent ties up with what we're after? You said you traced Bob Craig to waterhole, and Trent was headed there-- it's beginning to add up. That reminds me, I found this in waterhole. Look--the initials are r.C. Could stand for Robert Craig. Looks like some rough handling tore it loose. I figure when that watch fob tore loose, it was the end of Craig's trail. I think you're right, fuzzy. But I have a hunch the trail begins in barton city. I thought you ran that old prospector out of town. I thought I did. This time I'll really give him a working over. Hold it. I'm curious to find out what he's up to. I'm gonna find out what he wants over there-- you fellas come along. I want to check your records on some mining claims. What locality? Waterhole. Won't do you any good-- that property isn't open to public claim. I didn't ask you if it was public property, I just wanna see the records. Did you find something interesting at waterhole? That's my business. Am I gonna see them records, or ain't I? You'll have to tell me the section number of the property you're interested in. I thought you were told this part of the country ain't healthy for you. I'm feelin' plenty healthy-- Look out, fuzzy! Hold it, you tinhorns. You've got me all wrong, mister. This man's a very dangerous character, and he came in here looking for trouble. I came in here looking for records, and these two fellas jumped me. We've been after him for stealing supplies from our camp. I never stole nothin'. Don't you think it's a matter for the sheriff? Next time, I'm gonna take the law into my own-- hold it, flynt. Maybe the boys were mistaken about your friend. Well, see that the boys don't repeat that mistake-- it might prove fatal. Come on, fuzz. I told you that Cheyenne kid was dynamite. Dynamite can be useful-- when properly handled. ( Gunshots ) How she got out of there, I don't know. We'd better split up and look for her. And since your father is alive, I'm stuck until I can prove that sharp murdered the other heirs. Yes, I can see what a difficult job that'll be. But surely they must believe my father's dead. The fact that they attacked me proves it. Isn't there some way you can use me as bait to trap them? Yes, there is a way you can help. Something's spooky about the way that girl disappeared without a trace. You and your men are a bunch of bungling idiots. I've backtracked the trail, and the man are still searching. Round up more men and go over that district with a fine-toothed comb. Kid: What's the matter, sharp, lose something? Why, uh, why, yes, one of the horses strayed and the boys are looking for it. Are you sure? I thought maybe it was miss Trent. I don't know what you're talking about. But if I lost something like you, this whole state would be turned upside-down. I wonder if your interest is in miss Trent or her mining property. I've never seen her before and know nothing about her business. You'll know plenty about her from now on. Are you trying to threaten me? Miss Trent would like to hire your services as her attorney. Is this true? Yes. I'd like you to draw up my will. Your will? Pardon my amazement, but you're so young and look to be in such perfect health. I'm surprised you'd worry about such a document as that. I'd say this will is more in that nature of a life insurance policy. Miss Trent's life is in danger. Why would anyone threaten your life? For the same reason her father was killed two days ago. If anybody wants to get her, I want to fix it so they have to get me, too. How do you figure you can do that? Miss Trent is making me her beneficiary. That should transfer the heat to me and insure her life. We would like for you to get busy and draw up that will right away. With this will as an ace in the hole, I'm certain your daughter will be safe. It's good of you to help US this way, Cheyenne. You're helping me and fuzzy as much as we're helping you. What's our next move? I think the next move will come from sharp. We'd better go to barton city where he can find US. There ain't a sign of that Trent gal, we might as well quit looking. Stay here with the horses, I'm gonna see what's going on. We've really got something to tell sharp-- Trent ain't dead. I don't know what the Cheyenne kid told you, but I think something's happened to your father which is being concealed from you. Have you seen him since you've arrived? No. Then you only have Cheyenne's word that he's trying to help you. What are you trying to tell me? One of my men told me that the kid and his partner are holding a wounded man prisoner in a deserted shack. That man may be your father. But what can they gain by keeping dad a prisoner? The Cheyenne kid might have been trying to force your father to make a will in his favor. Something went wrong, and he tricked you into making one instead. But my will is valueless, unless-- unless your father is dead. I don't believe it. There's an easy way to find out, miss Trent. Clint, find Cheyenne Davis and bring him here. I don't know why he wants to see you, but it's important. With Trent dead, there's only one person standing between me and the waterhole mining property. Remember, miss Trent's will is made out in my favor. It could be changed. I don't think so-- she thinks I'm on the level. I'll give you till tomorrow morning to make up your mind. Uh, do you think that phony lawyer believes that you're throwin' in with him? Your guess is as good as mine, but we're holding the trump card as long as we have Trent. ( Gunshot ) He's asleep. I hate to wake him up, but I've got to find out if he's in condition to travel in case we have a showdown with sharp. Trent. Trent. Is he unconscious again? This time, for good. Turn around with your hands in the air. I wouldn't look in that bunk, miss Trent. Sharp: Hold it, Cheyenne, we know what your game is. Lay a hand on that girl, and we'll let you have it. You-- you've killed my father! Believe me, I didn't. Save it for the judge-- get their guns, boys. Nice goin', chey. Get your hands off me. We can hide out here until dark. What are you gonna do with me? Try and convince you that I had nothing to do with your father's death. It'll be pretty hard to do. Not if I can produce a guilty man. But first, to clear up your doubts of me, I want you to have this back. My will? But I thought-- take it. You won't need it any longer to ensure your safety since this case is ready to break wide open. What are you talking about? If you'll answer one question, I'm sure I can find the man who killed your father. Haven't you played enough games with me already? Someone else dealt the cards in the game, and I'm pretty sure I know who it is. All I need now is confirmation. What do you mean? Whoever told you your father was hidden in the shack is responsible for his death. Remember, I didn't tell you or anyone else where he was hidden, all I said was that he was safe. That's right-- then Vance sharp arranged the whole thing. But you can't blame me for believing him-- I was hidden in the closet when you made the deal with him. He claimed he only pretended to fall in with your scheme in order to trap my father's murderer. It's going to work-- but not the way he figured. ( Owl hooting ) This place is startin' to give me the jumpin' heebie-jeebies-- it's too spooky. We'll be on our way as soon as Diane wakes up. Don't worry--ghost don't start walking till midnight. Poor kid's had a tough time, she needs her rest-- hey! D-D-Did you say "ghosts"? This is a ghost town, isn't it? You know I don't believe any stories about spooks-- but I'm still scared of 'em. ( Mouse squeaks ) Ah! First time I ever saw a 4-legged ghost-- here's your hat. Relax for a while. Are you rested enough to ride to barton city? Oh, I'm all right. Fuzzy and I have some business to take care of after we leave you at the hotel. Hey...hey chey-- I just saw the toughest hombre I ever saw peekin' through this window. That tough-lookin' hombre is you--that's a mirror. Ha ha! Ha ha! You take the filing cabinet, I'll take the desk. Looks like we've drawn a blank. There's nothin' in the desk... Seems funny a lawyer wouldn't have a safe for his important papers. You don't suppose he hung 'em behind a picture, do you? Look like you hit the jackpot. You mean the jackpot hit me. Here are letters from several people answering sharp's advertisement. This one's from Rodney Trent. That's all we need to put a rope around that lawyer's neck. You're wrong, fuzzy. It only proves that sharp was trying to locate the waterhole heirs. But all we have to do is check if the other folks are missing. Before sharp can be brought to trial, we have to produce a corpus delecti. Corpus do which? The bodies of the murdered people. Like lookin' for a needle in a haystack-- I've covered this country all over before, you know. I hadn't figured on looking for the bodies. Today is the 14th, isn't it? It was all day, unless you want to be technical, it's probably past midnight. And if today is already tomorrow, then tomorrow is the 15th. Skip the comedy. According to this letter, there's another sucker due in on the 15th. If sharp has prepared his usual welcome, we'll have all the evidence we'll need. Are you Luther Johnson? Yes, what do you-- is this a holdup? If we were after your money, we could take it right here. Let's get out of sight. I have business in waterhole-- that's what I want to talk to you about. Didn't you answer a blind ad and get a reply from Vance sharp of barton city? Yes, he offered to buy some property of mine. I wasn't satisfied with the deal and decided to investigate for myself. You don't know it, Mr. Johnson, but we saved your life by stopping you here. Saved my life? Why should I be in any danger? You're one of half dozen suckers who fell for sharp's come-on. I have nothing to lose if I don't accept his offer. Nothing except your life. The others felt the same, and now one of them is dead and the rest are missing. Sharp evidently figures that murder is cheaper than buying your property. Then my hunch that property is still valuable is right. Considering the risks sharp is taking, the stakes must be plenty high. Have you proof that he's back of all this? No, that's where you come in. Me? Yep, and it's liable to be dangerous. I'm with you--what do you want me to do? We'll start by playing a little game of tag, and I'm afraid you're going to be "it". I spotted flynt and his men just over the hill-- are you sure you want to go through with this? Definitely. Then get out in the road and get set. All right, fuzzy, start shooting. ( Gunshots ) This is a piece of luck. The Cheyenne kid don't know it, but without these he won't be able to cut into our game. We lost 'em. They might circle back. Get him out of here, and then report back to sharp's office. We'd better leave our horses and sneak down the back alley. Come on, horse. Lay him down here till I open the trap door. Kid: Well, fuzzy, we'll find what's left of Bob Craig and the others. That's why the trail ended here in waterhole. There's still plenty of business to finish in barton city. Tie those men up, we'll take 'em with US. Now that we've recorded the deed to the Johnson property, there's nothing left to do but find the Trent girl, then start to develop that new vein at waterhole mines. But what about the Cheyenne kid? Flynt reports he's still in the vicinity. There's nothing to worry about. That was just a last try to cut in on our deal. It paid off, sharp. What kind of a game is this? "Follow the leader" if you're referring to what fuzzy's got in tow. Come on in, fuzzy. Sit down! Now, if you're talking about your own game, it's over. You're all under arrest-- I'm taking you to Phoenix to stand trial for the murder of Bob Craig and the others. It's was flynt's fault-- Johnson wasn't dead. Shut up, you idiot! You can't pin anything on me, marshal. Nothing but a mail order murder racket. With Johnson's testimony, there's enough evidence to convict you, with one exception-- and I'm gambling that I'll find out right here why that waterhole property is so valuable. I'm not mixed up in this-- you can examine my records. Everything is open and above board. What I'm looking for won't be in the open. Hey, chey--this office ain't got no safe either, but it's got a filing cabinet. You're right, fuzzy. See if it's got a trick drawer like the one in sharp's office. I'll betcha this is all we need to wind up this case. Exhibit a in the Phoenix court. I'm not connected to these murders-- it was Vance sharp's whole scheme, he made me forge those deeds! Why, you dirty squealer! Hold it, fuzz! We need him alive. Oh! ( Groaning ) So you could expect waterhole to boom again with this new gold strike. We certainly have a lot to thank you for. Well, Bob Craig deserves the thanks for discovering the new vein or ore, and his disappearance brought fuzzy and me here. Why don't you stay on-- to see that law and order is maintained. Well, you might, if anyone could. But I'm too restless to stay put very long. Besides, fuzzy will handle things here while I'm in Phoenix for the trial. That's right, you can depend on me to stick to-- looks to me like you're stuck with the job. So long, folks, maybe I'll be through again sometime. At least I'm leaving you in good hands.
