AMBER: So you've all heard the story, right? About what happens on July 4? Whoa, Amber, you want to freak everyone out? No. I just like hearing you tell it. What are you guys talking about? The Fisherman. Every 4th of July, he gets out his hat and slicker, he sharpens up his hook, and runs wild. But only after teenagers. That's right, the ones with dirty little secrets. What about you, Zoe? I bet you got some dirty little secrets. Yeah. I heard you suck in bed. Ugh! Nice. July 4. ♪ (FESTIVE MUSIC PLAYING) Hey! Seriously, a guy on my ski team knows this girl who went camping last summer, and they saw the Fisherman. Two days later, two kids didn't make it out of the woods. So he's kind of like Santa Claus, huh? Only in reverse. He goes after the kids that are naughty? No, he's more like Jack the Ripper, except the guy never got caught. LANCE: Well, I wouldn't worry. Dude, it's Broken Ridge, Colorado, in the summer. Even a psycho killer knows to avoid this place. Yeah, the guy would probably die of boredom before he got any of us. Hey, I heard you're running some sort of field trip in September. It's a photo shoot, really. Why, are you interested? Well, I figured since stud boy's gonna be gone to college, maybe you need somebody to carry your tripod. Very funny. Are--are you working, or are you just hitting on my girlfriend? Depends. You want to play? Whoa, what, with your balls? No, thanks. Come on, baby. Win me a monkey. Okay. But if I win, you crash at my place tonight. Tell your mom you're staying at Zoe's. Is that a yes or a no? First win the monkey. All right. Oh, yeah! I'll take that. Happy 4th of July, babe. I'm gonna miss you. I know. You're the lucky one. You get to take off and I have to stay here another year. It's weird, me in L.A. What do you mean? It's brilliant! And when I get there, it's going to be the most amazing place in the world for the two of us. Ugh, yuck. Marine Candidate Davis, reporting for duty. COLBY: Yo, P.J.! Oh, my gosh, P.J., I can't believe you actually did it. Well, just ROTC. Uh, you could say my daddy worked me over. P.J.: But, uh, guess who's next, little cuz? Yeah, that's right, I give it another year and he's coming after your ass. I don't think so. Come on, it's in our blood. And plus, chicks dig the hair. Uh-huh. Okay, true. True. Get a picture, come on. Yeah, okay. There. AMBER: Okay, get close... (SCREAMING) COLBY: Run! Run! Run! (SOBBING) Run! What was that? KIM: What was that? ZOE: It's him, it's the Fisherman! - What are you... - No! Is your arm okay? - I've never seen... - There he is! (BOTH SCREAMING) COLBY: There's a killer on the loose! COLBY: Get out of here! Run! Watch out! He almost got us! AMBER: P.J.! GIRL: P.J.! P.J.! AMBER: Oh, my God, look! GIRL: Oh, my God! AMBER: It's the Fisherman! ZOE: P.J., watch out! GIRL: Look out! SHERIFF DAVIS: Watch out, we're coming up! HAFNER: Police. Get out of the way! HAFNER: Get out of the way! Police! AMBER: Somebody's got to help him! GIRL: P.J.! P.J., run! (GIRLS SCREAMING) GIRL: (SCREAMING) No! (ALL EXCLAIMING) Oh, God! GIRL: Come on, you have to go try to help him. We can't leave him. SHERIFF DAVIS: Where'd he go, Hafner? I don't know, he came up here. (GASPING) Oh, God, that was insane! ZOE: I swear, he almost killed me. Sheriff Davis was on him. No. He got away. Guys, behind you. (ALL LAUGHING) - How was I? - (LAUGHING) Dude, you were awesome. Awesome. Oh, this stuff is sticky. I am having a heart attack. You guys said to make it real, so... Yeah, you almost nailed us with that thing. - 39 bucks on eBay. - Sure it was. Get this, the ad says this is the real hook, straight from the legend. Yeah, right. Okay. (SCREAMING) Damn it! Roger, give me the hook, man, get undressed. - How was P.J.'s move? - It was awesome. Oh, God, it was sick. Everyone saw it. So where is he? Yeah, where's P.J.? COLBY: Who moved the mattresses? What the hell are they doing there? POLICE OFFICER: Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey! POLICE OFFICER: Right there, please. POLICE OFFICER: Step back. (CHATTERING) Clear a path, people. Let's get this ambulance... You should've double checked the mattresses, Roger. Somebody moved them. Anyway, that was P.J.'s job. Yeah, just pass the ball to him. - This was your idea! - What? AMBER: Hey! Guys, we have to go to the police. And tell them what? That it was a big joke? It was an accident. Was it? What if we don't do anything? The man's a genius. ROGER: Look, I want to go to college. Everybody here wants to get out of this hellhole. And you're gonna be the next American Idol. Screw you. Look, everyone at that carnival thinks that some psycho in a raincoat did it, right? ROGER: Why should they think anything different? COLBY: We go to the police and what'll happen? P.J.'s dad will try to nail us. He never liked us to begin with, and in this small-ass town, innocent or guilty, we're dead. So we tell him that we're not doing this. ROGER: Think about it, Zoe, because we only get one chance at this. Screw it, I'm in. The guy came out of nowhere. We ran for our lives just like P.J. and everybody else. Okay, but the only way we pull this off is if we stick together and we keep it a secret. It dies with us. You really think it's that easy? Amber, telling the truth isn't gonna bring P.J. back. Everyone saw him cut you. Okay. The secret dies with us. Say it. The secret dies with us. Secret dies with us. ROGER: Amber. Say it. The secret dies with us. Burn it.
