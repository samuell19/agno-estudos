Quiet, please. Take one, mark. Greg, can you double-check our marks? I was on time, right? I was super on time. Not for my dates with Khani, but today, I was on time. Matt and I met on the dating app Hinge. Swiped right. Broke my streak of 58 nos. She had a picture of her surfing. I wanted to find someone that's fun. We're going to travel and adventure. That was my priority. I couldn't get a read on him. Every image was so different. There was one answer on Matt's profile where he's like, "I'm looking for a partner to compliment my lifestyle." This guy's looking for a life partner, definitely not for me. I wanted to put myself out there, just to have fun, nothing really serious. But let's try it, whatever. Eventually, it was, "Oh, you're matched." Then it was like, "I have to say something." "Hi, beautiful." Smiley face, and that was it. I never envisioned what's in store for us next, but we're matched, we're talking. Guess we're just gonna go on a date now. Might as well. Oh, my God, Indian food. This is really bold for a first date. We ordered some drinks. He was taking pictures of his food, the cocktails. I started drinking. "No! It's a beautiful drink." "You should take a picture." So, I'm like, "Okay." "This guy wants to document everything. Have at it," you know? It was so easy, talking about travels and our families, and it was just effortless. We clicked. We ended up staying a lot longer than I thought we were even there for. I think we left at 1:00 a.m. We gotta go. Really? Just a... Just a cheek kiss? Okay, like, "See you later." I just walked home, like, "That was a great first date. You know what? I'm gonna text him." This girl knows what she wants. That's kind of sexy. She's like, "Kiss me, damn it." We're gonna drink beers and throw axes. Cool, yeah. It was me and Matt and then one of his oldest friends, Mike. I never feel like a third wheel. We're just hanging out. It was funny though. Maybe that was his plan too. "Bring the Asian friend along so the Asian girl likes it." "Look, Khani, I have Asian friends." Cheers! After my other Hinge dates, just run-of-the-mill, I'm like, "This is more memorable." Things seemed to go in the right direction, where it's like, "This wasn't a fluke, the first date." "This will be another date where he doesn't kiss me." "See you later." Go home. Like, "Okay, whatever." But... Matt finally kissed me. Finally, you know. It was a good kiss. For our third date, it went from 0 to 100 real quick. It got to the point where I guess we're not joking. Huh? Are you serious? Third date, Costa Rica? Um... Okay. Let's just do it, you know? I said yes, just throwing caution to the wind. Kinda like, all right, go with the flow, see what happens. I was definitely texting my friends. No, I don't get murdery, stalkery vibes from him. And then my best friend, Liz, she's really good with advice. I said, "You're gonna go?" She said, "He bought the tickets." I said, "That doesn't mean you have to go!" I made sure that Khani turned her location on. I told her never to turn it off. Her motto in life was always, "Live fast, die pretty." I was like, "Maybe you could live a little longer and die adequate?" He was asking me, "What do you think? It's crazy, right?" I go, "Yeah, it is crazy." It's at the early stages of what would become the coronavirus, and I'm dismissive of this pandemic really being anything to worry about. He's just like "YOLO." I'm like, "NOLO." "You only live once. What's the worst that could happen?" Really doing this. YOLO. All right, we out here. Airport is dead. I'm filming it like I normally would, just travel vlogs. Matt is a person who vlogs himself all the time. He just can't stop. About to go see what this day has in store. I was half-expecting that she wouldn't be there. I was just not really trying to think much about it. I feel like if I sit on it too long and get into it, I'd probably back out. Because I didn't tell my work. I was trying to go there and back without them noticing. Called my mom. I didn't tell her until it was happening, 'cause I feel like she'd talk me out of it. She was like, "Okay, I'm not surprised. I can't stop you." "Am I worried? Yes." "But I hope you have a good time if you actually go." You know? "All right. Mom's fine with it. My best friend's fine with it." I did not, however, tell my dad. Here we go, moment of truth. She was there, early. Beat me there. Ready to go. - This is the whole flight. - This is it? - This is the whole flight. - We all here! We all here! Matt ended up filming, basically, the entire thing. Kill me! Look at this. - Hey, you want some help? - No. So determined. Packed flight. We appreciate you coming with us, you few brave souls. Things to put your minds at ease... None of us of the crew has this coronavirus, so that's the good news. The other good news is we have toilet paper on this flight. So you'll be happy to know that as well. What do you think, Khani? - You regretting your decision yet? - Fuck us. Even though I always do this, "adventure, push yourself out of your comfort zone," is this too far? "Do you take a girl on your third date? Is this gonna go terribly wrong?" Asking myself, "When is my luck gonna run out?" We made it. Barely. Barely. It's all part of the fun. Finally get to the hotel. This is the start of the date, but we're tired, it's late, we've been traveling all day. It didn't really dawn on me until at that moment, "Oh." "We have to sleep together in this room." "Do I make a move tonight?" That's going to be a first. The vibes weren't quite the same. We just didn't have that touching and flirting quite as much. "Okay, I'm just gonna sleep over here on my side." "You can, like, sleep on your side." If things go weird, I'm out of here. "See you later, never talk to you again." And like, "I'll figure out my own way and take care of myself." I hope this goes well these next few days. - Got the key? - Sí. All right. Time to explore. Are you still listening to your call? Yeah. Half-listening. Half-listening? Is it exciting? No. We definitely had our share of awkward moments. - Here we go again. - Ow, my... Can't handle the seat again. You'll be all bruised up. I take video though. - Watch it later. - Is that what's going on? Yeah, you're on camera. Smile. Shake your ass. It didn't help that Matt was filming so much. Are you an influencer, Matt? No. One day. Perfecto. At that time, I was working with influencers. Oh, my God, so annoying! If I had red flags or deal-breakers, it'd be, "I don't want to date an influencer-type person." I didn't find out until Costa Rica. "This guy's trying to be a vlogger." And I told him how much I hated influencers. - What are you doing? - Vamanos. What are you making? We'll hang out, but I'll get some cool content in Costa Rica. I'll take advantage of this opportunity, throw it up on YouTube, get those followers. My name is Matt Robertson, and I'm done following the status quo. This is the beginning of my new life filled with adventure, travel, and new experiences. I'm gonna make mistakes. I'm gonna make memories. I'm gonna make my life a movie. If I saw this, I wouldn't have gone on the first date with him. Why am I not surprised at this promo trailer for his life? Movie Matt! Yeah, that's a fun handle. "Make life a movie. Subscribe!" I like this guy. Salud. The more we drank, the more comfortable we became. What's the term, "social lubricant"? Yeah, you could say that. We definitely had that energy again pick up and start to be flirty. Come on. That's when it started getting very relaxed and casual. We're starting to get more affectionate. Uno mas? The vibe was great. I was really happy about it. It didn't even cross my mind, "My God, what does he think of me?" Thought it was just, you know, a fun vacation. I was so desperate to just feel free. A lot of the relationships I'd been in just left a really bad taste in my mouth. If I made more money than them, if I had more ambition than them, more friends than them, it would always make the guy insecure, and they would lash out about it. I always had to hide. I wasn't able to be myself. That drained a lot out of me, and I was not in a rush to get back into a relationship. I was just excited to spend time on my own, completely without anyone to take care of. For me, I always saw dating and, like, a serious relationship as something I would do later. I was going out a lot, working in spirits and nightlife. Through that, it was convenient to date people that I would meet out at a bar, a club, an industry event. Insta-girls. You know? After being stuck in a bad relationship for so long, I wanted to go out and have fun. Neither one of us were looking to change our ways. It was the perfect little vacation to start out. I think it was day four where things really started to get real. Good morning, y'all. Today, we're going to try again to go zip-lining. Yesterday, we failed and were too late. Overslept a little bit. Two-hour time difference, still haven't adjusted. And having a little bit too much fun I guess, too. Man-bun looking crazy. - Hello, Khani. - Hi. It's nice and tight. Has to be that tight? Careful! Careful. Yeah. See? - No, make it tighter. - No! Are you scared, Khani? No. Are you? You're the one afraid of heights. I'm not scared of heights. First time zip-lining. Here we go. Lean back. - I am! - Lean back more. Put your neck on this side, then you can be forward. This side? Okay. Coming in hot! Khani's my fanner. What service. - Flight's been canceled. - No! "Urgent information about your trip." "Canceled." This isn't real, you know. They didn't really cancel it. What are they thinking? We have to get home. Things are going well, right? At this point, I'm not really worried about us having that vibe and that connection. More time for drinking and the beach. Cool. Well, Khani... - Stuck here with you now. - Stuck here with me. - Lucky you. - Am I? I don't know. - We'll find out. - Yeah. Time will tell. Getting stuck with Matt, I was like, "Okay, he's cutting my time short." Like, spending this time by myself. I'm perfectly content being single. Too soon. I don't need a guy. But now I have no choice. Breaking news. Stay at home. That is the order tonight from four state governors as the coronavirus pandemic spreads. The great shutdown of 2020 is underway. We know the hospital surge is coming. The US borders to Mexico and Canada set to close to non-essential travel. That's why the flight's canceled. People can't come and go right now. This shit's starting to get real. Level four travel advisory. No flights in or out, anywhere. Might be here a little longer than I thought. Good morning, everybody. Starting to get real that I'm not going home. It's definitely scary being in a foreign country not knowing how crazy it'll get here. About to go to the beach. Damn police showed up. Each day got more and more intense in what was happening back home. The lower risk individuals... New York looks like the worst place to be. So, trying to feel better, "You did the right thing. Good call." "You're in Costa Rica. There's nothing... There's no coronavirus here." Swimming world championships. Today's competition... What is the stroke again? Butterfly stroke. - I can't do butter... Breaststroke. - I mean, breaststroke. My mom, she's a nurse, and she was assigned to help treat the COVID patients at her hospital. So, I was worried. "Mom, are you going to be safe? What will you do?" You hear all the stories about frontline workers and nurses and stuff and how they are exhausted. And being so far away, I felt a little helpless knowing I couldn't fly home if I needed to. I also felt guilty about not being honest with my dad that I was here with a guy. She lies to protect herself. Like, "They don't need to know." I will admit, growing up, I had a compulsive lying disorder because I had so much to hide from my parents. They were very strict. Mommy is not gonna allow it in the house. She doesn't like dogs or cats in the house. When she moved in with me in college, it was because her dad kicked her out. And so, then it was like, "Okay, let's tread lightly." With my dad, some things are just better left unsaid with him. My mom said, "You should tell him you're in Costa Rica." When she said she was with coworkers, I was like, "Okay, got that lie." "Check." I thought he'd say, "You're crazy." But he said, "Good, get out of New York." "It's not safe there. It's the epicenter of everything." "Whew, you made a smart decision." Which is really surprising. I'm like, "My dad thinks I made a smart decision?" Sometimes, things are better to tell him after the fact. Mike asked if your work knew that you were here? So, Mike's all about puns. He said, "What a Khan job that was." - That's a good one. - Yeah. I didn't have as strict of an upbringing as her, for sure. But growing up, I was super lucky to have such supportive parents, family, friends, grandparents, extended family, that I think, looking back, led to the confidence and outlook on life that I have. I do have that bottle of rum you gave me. That's fine. We can drink that later. - I'd rather have gin and tonic. - I never opened it, so... At that point, I tried so hard not to even think about the fact that I couldn't be with them. We just felt really far away from it all. Kind of over here, watching this movie transpire, only with each other. What's up, y'all? It's your boy Movie Matt. Just got some pretty unsettling news that someone tested positive for corona in my grandfather's senior home. I guess they're in a full lockdown and... just hoping everything's all right and my grandfather will stay safe. Stay tuned and stay safe. I knew Matt was worried, but he was shrugging it off, like, "Oh, yeah, you know. Like, he's fine." He didn't want to come across too vulnerable. I think that was something we both were doing. Neither of us wanted to let our guard down at that point. In my mind, I'm like, "When will we get home?" And there's still no flights. Then it was just, "Okay, we're stuck here together." "We got to figure things out." Now I'm with this girl that I don't know that well for an extended amount of time. I was worried about a few days. Now we're going on a full week. We're running out of clothes to wear, out of new things to talk about. I wanted that dynamic to change, so I had to switch up the approach. Matt, he saw a pirate ship just floating by. It looks like it used to be a really popular tourist attraction, but it's seen better days. So I make an arrangement. We'll do a date night on the pirate ship. I'm like, "The beach is closed. We can't go there." He's like, "There's always a way." ♪ Walking down, burning up ♪ ♪ I look at you and light it up ♪ ♪ You're a sight for sore eyes... ♪ Coming up on The Black Pearl here. I knew my destiny would be complete one day. This is the moment I've been waiting for. We're... Oh! Captain Jack Sparrow has seen better days. Got my fish. Check him out. - Maybe you jump off of this? - Yeah? Gonna walk the plank? In all of the relationships I've been in, I've been the one coming up with ideas, so it felt new and exciting. It was perfect timing. The sun's setting. It looks really pretty. We're jumping off into the ocean. ♪ You're a sight for sore eyes ♪ ♪ Don't know why I hesitate when I can... ♪ We're about to jump off. Perla Negra. One, two, three. Yeah, there's a little bit of thought in it. I guess that was the start of the turning point for us. ♪ I don't wanna hesitate ♪ ♪ I don't wanna hesitate ♪ We would've stayed at the hotel as long as we could, but they said, "We're shutting down. You have to leave." We had a flight home, finally. But it didn't leave for three weeks. The plan was to hunker down in an Airbnb until then. I wasn't excited about this forced living situation, but it felt like Matt and I needed to be on the same page to get through this. - We made it. - Made it. Casa Divina. That Airbnb in Montezuma, a nice lady who felt for our situation hooked us up with a great deal. We're stuck here. This is gonna be home. What's up, y'all? It's day 11. Uh, wait. No, it's day... It's day 12. Trying to figure out how to survive out here in Costa Rica. When we got to Montezuma, there were already rules about what days you could leave. You were only allowed to leave to go to the hospital, pharmacy, or grocery store. It's one thing to drink and eat and hang out together, but now, we're gonna basically move in together. Should we sanitize any of this stuff? I dunno. I think we'll be all right. She was like, "I don't know what to think." "He's recording everything." "There's probably some going to the bathroom." Khani's kitchen. In this type of situation, where you're just together 24-7, there's almost no motive to try to be anything but yourself. Todo bien. Ready to survive the apocalypse. Maybe it should've been expected with the handle "Movie Matt." Like, his life's a movie. Look, our friend came to see us. Hey, buddy. No, it's okay. Look, look, look, look. Oh, food. - Ooh! There we go. - Oh! Spike was the iguana that lived in Montezuma. See, we're friends. Come on, bro. Thought we had an understanding. You feel safer down there? That's where he lives. His house. Oh-for-one. Your turn. I don't know about this. Oh! When you're seeing a guy for the first time, you want to put on your best outfits. I'm like, "Oh, no. He's seen me drenched in sweat." "He's seen me, you know, no makeup on." There's no point trying to look good because it won't work. What he sees is what he gets. We're just still having fun. My mindset was, "This is still just a fling." "This is a fun guy, memorable experience." "This is just a situation we just happen to be in, but I hope it's not a relationship." Meanwhile... Doing her yoga. Hello? I very much prioritize work over anything else. Matt makes his own schedule. I have a very strict nine-to-six. We have to be working that entire time, and I can't afford to lose my job. What are you doing? I don't want to get to a point where I'm stuck in this country, dependent on this guy. I wasn't thinking, "Future. This could be a relationship." It was more, "I need to keep the vibes going." I wanted to keep it going, but I didn't know where it was going to. He's tired. Kill something. Being quarantined, the two of us, it's like you can't do anything, so I would try to jam-pack the days with activities. "We're taking a magic class. Now we're doing the tango lesson." Just all these little mini dates within the day. ♪ They say you know when you know ♪ ♪ And I'm not ready to go... ♪ We ended up having different cooking nights. Every night's a different cuisine. Squid, tuna, toros. It was a great opportunity to get to know Khani and discover how amazing she is. Genuine, caring, thoughtful. I mean, the total package. We get the most beautiful beach all to ourselves. Beachside bartender. Lime tea. So, we turned this into a nudist colony. First time fucking on a lifeguard stand. Oh, my God! I was trying to sneakily just glaze over that. Chemistry was definitely intensifying. There's some passion there and a lot of great sex. Yeah, there were definitely sparks. When you're stuck together, there's not much else to do but drink and fuck. So... There goes la policia. They said hi and they said bye. Khani flashed them. Everything was good. Work was getting done. We got some sun. But, you know, not expecting to be there for as long as we were, my birth control runs out. Let me just find a pharmacy and see what they would recommend. I bring my pack. I'm like, "Hey, do you have anything similar to this one?" They said, "We have this. It's pretty much the same." Let me just google this brand and see what it's like. I saw a press release, "If you're using these brands, be careful." "They've been sold on the black market and some pills are fake." "There have been reports of pregnancy from using this birth control." I'm like, "Oh, this isn't good." I'm hoping, because I got mine from a pharmacy, it's legit and nothing will happen. Um... Why'd you invite your friend? Spike. All right, Spike's outta here. - He doesn't know what to do! - You're so dumb! Spike. Oh, Spike! Spike's so dumb. Spike's blind. He's not dumb! What could possibly go wrong? I really wanted to cut the man-bun off, but I got cold feet. - Something happened over here. - If you don't notice it, then it's okay. It didn't feel like a... ...a good little cut there. I think you moved when I did that. I don't think I did. But there's a little patch here. Hey! Stop! I'm trying to protect the bed! Montezuma is when a lot of the bugs came out. So many insects, bugs, creatures. - Look what's happening here. - Ew! Where did that come from? I don't know, but there's a lot. Look at the size of that spider. Oh! - There we go. - Oh, my God! It's alive! Hell, no! What the fuck is that? Dead! Bitch. - Khani, how are you feeling? - Itchy. - She's feeling bitchy. - "Itchy"! Oh, she's feeling itchy. It's not just the sight of it, or, "This is scary." My whole body was covered in bug bites. - Those are new ones? - Yeah. Look at you. You're a big mess. My skin blows up, I get really itchy. I mean, she was in actual pain. Like, physical pain. Each day, I'm like, "What's it going to be now?" Or, "What am I gonna have to do to get through this?" Saturday morning. I've never made pancakes. But I feel like I have not been doing the bulk of the cooking, cleaning, any of those things around here. So, I'm gonna start the weekend off right by making pancakes. All right, guess I'll just put some in here, not sure how much. Put some chocolate chips in mine. Don't tell me what to do. I'm requesting. I'm not demanding like you are. There's gonna be multiple varieties of pancakes today. Uh-oh. Seems a little... Did you put oil down? No, didn't tell me. Supposed to be "no-stick." Living with a guy, which I did before, it felt like I was going back into old patterns, which is why I was a little bit, like... Ugh, I just... I don't want to get back into that habit of always putting a guy above myself. I lose myself as a person when I'm in it. I don't care about my needs, and I let them trample over every ounce of being that I am. It was just not something I wanted at all. You know, you're out here for three weeks with just one person, it's a lot of time together. And somebody you don't even really know like that, well, it can get, um, a little taxing. You get a little tired of that. I'm not ready for... marriage anytime soon, that's for sure. It's not even like a normal relationship. 'Cause in a normal relationship, you can leave and do your own thing and... In this case, locked up, quarantined abroad, spending 24 hours a day with somebody. My parents didn't flee from Vietnam for me to live like this! How are you doing with these power outages? Not good. I was in the middle of getting a cockroach off the bed. Oh. There's definitely points of pressure and things going on, where one of us may be not feeling so great that day, or feeling overwhelmed, but you're not in a relationship with this person, so do you confide in them? It was weird. Guys, amazing news. We're leaving the house! Time to explore. Finally! Finally, Khani is ready. Fin... Hey! Only taken you all day to get ready. - Throw your little thingy out the window. - Don't throw my thingy. All right, so we're on the way to Cabuya Island. This is a famous, famous island, 'cause it's a haunted island in Costa Rica. - How long does it take to get there? - Forty minutes. Forty minutes? We're gonna be out past curfew. Good spot to take a dip. Oh, my God! What the fuck? That's not good. What the fuck? I can't! It won't let me open the door. We're fine. We just gotta... push a little bit. Why won't it let you open? Should I climb out the window? I don't know. Matt! Oh, my God. Could be a matter of seconds before this thing gets submerged, or water's coming in, or we flip over. I'm also worried when she gets out, maybe this is going to shift the weight, and I'm just gonna go in. Holy shit. How bad is it? Like, the wheel's not even touching the... Yeah. It's really bad. Oh, wow! Next thought, now that we're out and safe... "This is going to be expensive." All right, so... I'm not strong enough for any of this. How are we gonna get out of here? It's getting dark. We need to try to get this out of the lagoon. We see a car driving by. We flag it down. Before you know it, the whole village came out. There was a dozen people. Can't make this shit up, y'all. We got rope. Someone had a truck and they hooked it up. It was a whole team effort to get this thing out. It's just the spirit of Costa Ricans. They're always willing to help, always jumping in. Good times, y'all. Good times. Beautiful day to sun yourself, here at the local Cóbano mechanics' station. Asian drivers are not bad drivers. He is. Thank you for calling the Elite Member line. Sir, how can I help you today? The flight that I had is not showing in my trips anymore. Yeah, from what I'm showing, it looks like any routes available isn't until June 2nd. Is when we're opening up that route again. Okay. So, that's Tuesday, June 2nd. Confirmation emails with the updated itinerary are being sent out, so you should be receiving that shortly. All right. Thank you so much. - Pray for us. - Yeah. - No problem, thank you. - Thanks. - Have a great day. - Bye. She didn't get my joke. Longest third date in history... ...just got a lot, lot longer. It was just like, "Okay, enough's enough." "I just want to go home." But the world is shut down, and that's just not an option. I don't know when we'll get out of here, if we'll get out of here, how things will change. It was a little bit unbearable, so... Khani's talking tough today, y'all. And we are celebrating day 30 by taking 30 shots. Thirty for thirty. Thirty days abroad, 30 shots. That's what's going down. Twenty-eight to go. I realized it's not just my vlog anymore, and I think that's reflected in the footage, where I'm not performing. I'm not like, "Hey, let's go on an adventure." We're still stuck, uh, drinking again. It's 11:00 in the morning. How long will this go on for? You start to look internally and ask yourself questions. "What do you want from life? What will happen?" And some walls started to come down. Hello? It's Khani reporting from Costa Rica. I don't know if I will survive this. But we shall find out. So, we could go... here, over here, and then down here somewhere. Being with Matt, he was someone who liked to take care of a lot of things. He would always be the first to take charge of plans if we need to fix something or go somewhere. I was really starting to notice that quality in him and appreciate it. Hearing about some of her past, not-so-great relationships, I couldn't believe that anyone would treat her that way. So, in my mind, I was like, "You better not fuck it up." "You better make up for all those assholes that missed out." All right, that's a wrap for Casa Divina. It's been a wonderful stay. If this is how things keep going, why don't we just try to find other places? This became a pattern, where I copy-paste this chain message that I send to all the Airbnbs, update the number of days that we've been stuck, hope they feel bad for us and give us a good rate. I remember you telling me about your other amazing Hinge dates. - You were my first! - Yeah, yeah. Did not kiss you. You didn't like it. I felt like I needed to have you thinking a little like, "Huh." "What did I do wrong?" There was nothing wrong with me, it was you! Good news. We finally made it. It's an interesting one. A little pet cemetery when we walk in. Cacao and Acerola, rest in peace. There's another one. "Papaya." Oh, no! These are plants, the names of plants. - Here's the bathroom. - Okay? Are you just gonna, like, see me shit and piss here, or what? Headed to the jungle. The jungle? We're going camping. Being out in the darkness of the jungle, Matt wants to light a fire and cook. I don't think Khani was a big fan. It was... Yeah. Look at that Asian squat, y'all. I felt like the trust between us naturally built, just trying to survive with each other. The fact that we're both go-with-the-flow, we're chill, we're both adventurous, it just kind of worked. We just felt it out. We didn't know what we were doing, but we adapted. Over the course of these several weeks, I'm going from, "This is just a vacation," to, "I'm starting to fall for this girl." And trying to fight that feeling, I think. My old self being like, "No, no, no." Like, "You gotta stay a bachelor. Don't do this." Your turn, buddy. You gonna stay by yourself, or play with your friends? It was like devil and angel on my shoulder. That's a couple and that's a couple. Oh, wow. My parents would check in, like, "Make sure you guys go everywhere together, stay in one group." You know? But, yeah, he didn't suspect a thing. With my mom, she never wanted to let us worry. She's like, "It's fine. I'm excited to be helping." Her positive, optimistic view of it all settled my concerns a little bit. We made it to our new home. Oh, with a doggy! Khani found a new dog already. Just woke up. Finally got a decent night's sleep. Opened the shade here, expecting to see the amazing volcano. But no, just clouds. It's completely covered. No volcano. Little disappointed. Hopefully, it gets clear. There is horses though. La Fortuna, that's the week that I was supposed to get my period on birth control. It wasn't coming, and I've been pretty regular for the past, what, 14, 15 years at that point? I'm like, "I always get it on Tuesdays." And then Tuesday's here, it's not here. A couple of days go by, and... I hope I didn't get one of the janky birth control packets. I'm like, "It's just a few days late, give it some time." Wait, show me. It was a really stressful situation. I was just trying to rationalize why it didn't come when it usually did. I didn't want to stress about it too much until I knew for sure, but we both didn't want children. Matt, he always went out of his way to try to make me feel comfortable. He would always bring me a drink. The littlest things I wouldn't think he'd pick up on. He was just trying to be supportive and anticipate my needs, and that was a new experience for me. She was super supportive and always trying to do the same for me. Not too bad. Overall. I'm gonna eat some pasta. I wasn't trying to think too much into it, but in my mind, I was like, "We have to get back home." "We can't have a kid in another country." To be continued, world. - Fall in love with me yet? - I was just going to say the same thing. I don't fall in love anymore. I don't catch feelings. I don't have any feelings. You're a numb robot. Exactly. It's in the past. Michael? What is up, Mateo? Hi, Callie. Hi, Uncle Matt. How are you? Good. I'm jealous you're stuck in Costa Rica. Yeah, I know, I'm stuck here. They started doing Zoom calls with me to make margaritas. And it was nice for me to actually have these fun little adult moments. Because I was going through my divorce at that time. He was going through all of this stuff himself. I think if you're really close to people and they're going through something, they'll call you all the time, and I had a lot of space to talk. At that point, Matt wants to hear from Liz. "Let me meet one of your friends." He wants to meet you. This is Elizabeth. - Hey, Elizabeth. - My girlfriend. - Hi! - How you doing? I'm good. How are you? When I heard he wanted to talk to me, I was like... "Are you going to be super cheesy and tell me all the things I want to hear?" I was kind of surprised. I was like, "She might be as crazy as I am." She is, for sure. I feel like you've met your match. He seemed really interested in getting to know who she was as a person. And he liked the bad things about her. You know? So, I think that's how you know that they really care about your friend. I just don't know the details of when we get back to New York. Like, how that... will, you know, transpire. Oh! I think you're... Wait. Oh! She's gonna think I hung up on her. Call her back. What are we gonna do? I've always been close to my grandpa. Thinking about him going through this alone was difficult. You feel kind of helpless where it's like you can't do anything. All you can do is call or FaceTime. And, you know, what do you say? It's still not the same as being there. It'd be nice to be back home now. All right, quarantine is not over. But you get a 24-hour hall pass where everything is back to normal. What are you doing in 24 hours? Going to a bar, getting my nails done. As I got to know Matt, I'm like, "He's someone I wouldn't mind being in a relationship with." But part of it was just an internal battle where I felt I was betraying myself. Matt didn't have the red flags I had with my last relationship. He made me feel comfortable being with him. He accepted me for who I was, never made me feel wrong for doing anything I wanted to do. And so, I feel like that really let me really be myself and not want to hide things from him. For me, assuming I haven't just had a super amazing fresh haircut from Khani's Cuts, then I would get a haircut. I realized that a relationship didn't have to be the bad things I've experienced in the past. - A massage. - Yeah, I'll get a massage too. It could be like this. - What are you doing? - It's time for an adventure! To the volcano-hot springs-waterfall-lake. All right. "During the winter, avoid blah, blah, unpredictable something." It's summer. "Wildlife." Yep, there's a lot of it. - You wanna use the bathroom? - Hell, no. You want to stop at the bar? You can hear the river already. Oh, there's a doggy. Found ourselves a tour guide. And three dogs. A lot of the trip, even if feelings are happening, she was definitely keeping that stone-cold face of no feelings. "Whatever." I was like, "There's no way." "I'm feeling this. She has to feel something." We made it. Hi, bud. We never really talk about what happens after, so, in my head, I'm like, "Okay." "He's not bringing it up. Maybe we'll just go our separate ways." I didn't want to let my guard down. I'm not gonna ride up this mountain with you, only to be tumbling down. Pura vida. Pura vida. We were both probably thinking that, but no one's bringing it up, so we're not gonna talk about it until we have to. What a view. Hey! This went on for a while. Time, and everything that happened, I feel like, brought those walls down and wore down my ability to fight it. That's when I was like, "Okay." It started to be "we" and not just "me." ♪ Tell me that your love is a sure thing ♪ ♪ Tell me that your love is a sure thing ♪ We survived, man.

We're in our four-wheel-drive mode. We have two hours to get to civilization. It's gonna be a bumpy ride. It's gonna be a bumpy ride, just like the whole trip. When we got back to San José, my period finally came. I'm like, "Crisis averted." We can go back to our regularly-scheduled programming. That Costa Rican birth control came through in the clutch. After everything that's happened to us, finally, some good news.

I've been quarantined in Costa Rica for six weeks. But just wait, that's not even the craziest part. Everyone, meet Khani. The most beautiful girl in all of Costa Rica. - Such a sweet talker. - Look at her. Where are you going? I don't know what he's told you, but he's trapped me here. He's making me work out, making me cook for him. Help! Someone help me before he falls in love with me. Hey! First of all, I think you got it twisted. I will not fall in love with you. Maybe the other way around. - I don't catch feelings. - Yeah, right! I think we've both had a good time here though. Hmm. Debatable. When I posted the vlog introducing Khani for the first time, that was my way of being like, "We're going to take a next step here. I'm just putting it out there." ♪ Isn't that what we both need? ♪ It's girls' day, and seeing as Khani has no girls here, I'm the fill-in. I'm a woman again, with my nice, beautiful lashes. I lost my beard. - He looks like a baby again. - El guapo. It felt like, "All right, we're a unit and a couple," without declaring it. What color do you want? I'm gonna love all of them. - Khani is hangry. - No, I'm not! This is a hangry emergency. - What are we doing today, Khani? - We're getting tattoos. Khani is getting her rib tattooed with "pura vida," but she forgot to wear deodorant today. It wasn't like it was his name. It was just to commemorate the time we spent here together. It means "pure life." Really enjoying it, living it to the fullest. That's what we were doing in Costa Rica. In the end, I decided to add an iguana. Spike's gonna go right here. Now, he's still here, mocking me forever. Pura vida. - You're blinding me! - Are you getting angry yet? No. Could I get angry at your cutie-patootie face? - Let's go eat. - Bam! Violence is not the answer. You're a scaredy-cat! ♪ We ain't gonna live forever ♪ ♪ So we should just get together ♪ When I posted the vlog about Khani, I had no idea how many people were gonna see this thing. One girl that follows me, she saw it, and was like, "Hey, can I share this?" People Magazine was one of the first interviews. That just started this whole whirlwind of everyone finding out. From there, it was one interview after another. Matt Robertson and Khani Le stranded in Costa Rica. I went from being very private about even casual relationships, to now the whole world is going to know that I have a self-declared girlfriend. One of the earlier interviews we did, the interviewer asks us, "Are you guys boyfriend and girlfriend?" And Matt was just like, "Yeah, we are." And in my head, I was like, "Oh, we are?" Matt's walking around like he didn't even say it. I'm sick of you! Why? And, honestly, I didn't love having my private life out there for all the world to see. My cousins started seeing it. My aunts started texting my mom. Khani's lies were catching up with her, yep. I knew it would get back to my work, so I set up a call to my boss. "Just to let you know, something's coming out about where I've really been the past few months." "I've actually been in Costa Rica with a guy." They thought it was super funny. "Oh, thank God." It got to where I was just worrying that my dad might see it already. But I still couldn't bring myself to tell him. I feel tense! - Why? We just did this. - Oh, baby. All right. - Jeremy asked us... - What? You're not talking enough. Start over! I hated interviews. I didn't love this side of Matt. I started to wonder what his motives were with all of this. I started thinking, "What if we get back, and we end up going our separate ways and it was over?" There might have been a bit of pressure to stay together. So many people were rooting for them and wanted this to be a big, romantic love story. Khani would sometimes be like, "What if it's not?" "I don't want to disappoint anybody." I said, "You can't think like that. You have to do it for you." If you're gonna be with somebody, make it because you want to be with them. - Khani is dealing with the press... - Hey! ...by putting on a disguise. She's got her baseball cap on that I bought her. No one will ever see the real me. No autographs, no photos, please. Matt would say, "All this stuff is happening. I can handle it, because I'm just built for this." But then, you know, Khani, I don't think she really signed up for it. - Literally all for Khani. - Not all for me. I had this little plate and half of this sandwich, and then she has all this. Hey, still more coming. She's a beast. Everyone's texting me about the story. And then, my sister, in our group chat, was like... Now my mom with the smiley face! What the fuck's going on with my family? - Let me see. - They're not making it any better. And then, the issue is one of those five people is her father, who doesn't know that I am here. Khani's dad, I just want you to know I'm a nice guy. I'm taking good care of defending Khani from the spiders, and not so much the bugs. She got a lot of bug bites. But I'm doing my best out here. - And... - He's a good guy, Dad. ...don't be too mad at Khani. - She wanted to protect you from the truth. - My mom hates beards. - Your mom hates beards? - Yeah. Shit. Now I got... Hi, Khani's mom. I'm a nice guy. My beard is way better than it used to be, so... Look at my new tattoo. It's Spike. - Oh, they hate tattoos. - Oh, then don't look at that. Oh! Things are getting worse. Buenos dias! What's that for? - Our flight got canceled. - I saw. You already knew? Figured. We've had so many close calls where we're going home and we don't. What are we gonna do? It's not fun anymore. Like, let's just go home. You planned this. No, the only other... You called them and asked for them to cancel it, didn't you? Having too much fun. The only other embassy flight that's operating flies out tomorrow. There are three seats left. At this point, they announced through the embassy that they'd have government-sponsored flights. We just got to get this flight back. So, we bit the bullet, and spent thousands of dollars to get home. This one felt real. It's been confirmed. It's still on my phone. Let's get back to the States. We have one final residence, hopefully. Wish us luck. My mom said, "He's gonna find out. It'll be better coming from you before he finds out himself." "Say you've been dating him for a while. Don't tell him that you just met him..." - You're gonna lie to him again? - Huh? You're gonna lie to him again. Yeah, but it's just a lesser lie to make him, you know, come around a little bit more. But he's gonna read all the articles. You'll tell him they're all lying? Yeah. You've never lied to your parents before? Yeah, but not about everything. Sounds like you lie to them about your entire life. Basically, yeah. - You gonna lie to me? - I told you. - What? - I would never lie to you. Why do you laugh when you say that? I dunno. It's 'cause my dad restricts me, so I lie to be able to live my life freely. - So, if I don't restrict you... - Yeah. If you try and stop me from doing anything I want to do, that's when I start lying to you. All right. You're gonna vomit? Why? I hate talking to my dad. I know she was definitely a little anxious going into that phone call, and it was something that she'd been putting off for a while. Look at how pretty you look. I know, I wish I looked this good on BuzzFeed. Ew. Get out of here! Hello. Hi, Dad. Hey! What's up? What's going on over there? Not much. Don't tell me your flight got canceled. Not exactly. But... Uh-oh. So, what's going on? You know how I'm here with a group of friends? Mm-hmm. So, one of those friends is someone I've kind of been seeing. Wait. A guy? Yeah. I thought you said that you are... All of you are girls? No, I just said it was a group of friends. Okay, that's not cool. Um, someone had caught wind of our story and really liked it, and now it's been making its way around the news. And we're just getting a lot of attention around it now. Be extremely careful in what you say. He was getting into his Dad mode and lecturing me. "Whatever you say will stay forever on the Internet." "You want to be careful." So I'm like, "Okay, let's just get over with this lecture." "Sweep the guy under the rug. Maybe he won't remember it again." Then the other thing, you never told us you're with a guy. You're with a guy for two months, man. - That's not... - Yeah. Yeah, that's not cool, Khani. We don't even know who the guy is, or what kind of a person he is. I'm sure that, you know, you... you... you have judgment of your own, but, you know... That's a long time, you know. Yeah, well, we didn't expect it to be this long. And I'm not, like, alone with him. - Okay? - Okay. Did you tell Mommy yet? Um, I'm gonna call her after this. I'm sure Mom is gonna want to see his picture and stuff. - Yeah, I'll text her a heads-up. - Okay. Okay. All right, love you. Okay, I love you, too. Bye. Okay, bye. I thought my dad would react more... Maybe more harsh, critiquing my decision-making. But he treated me like an adult, and it made me question why I was lying. It was just new for me, you know? Opening up to my dad. All right. Tell me what happened. - How did it go? - I got a lecture. Yeah. About? More so about, "Be careful what you're saying in the media." "You never know how much it'll come back to hurt you." Um... What did he say about... me? He's like, "You're there with a guy? That's not cool." I didn't feel more relieved, just because I know it's on his mind now. Like, "What if he looks it up?" And, yeah, it just stressed me out almost a little bit more. It's our last day. That's right, last day in Costa Rica. How are you feeling? I'm ready to go home. Yeah? You mean, "Ready to go to Texas!" The last few days in Costa Rica, Khani was distant. It was weird. I didn't know if it was because we were leaving, or I did something. I didn't know what to make of it. What are you about to do, Khani Kharnitas? Check in! - For what? - Our flight home. Day 78. We are checking in. Usually, we don't get to this point. My dad sent me an article, "The Internet never forgets," in all caps. Don't you forget either. I would never forget you. So, the question would be... I was wondering... How do I make this sound casual? What are you wondering? I don't know. Do you feel like on this trip that you've changed any? Or are you the same? I think I'm the same. - No, but... - Me, myself, personally? - Yeah. - As a person? You haven't changed at all on this trip? You haven't done anything new? I told you I don't like being vulnerable. Okay, so, that's one thing. I feel like you've let yourself be more vulnerable on this trip. - You forced me... - I didn't force you. - ...into an uncomfortable position. - You chose to be vulnerable. I feel like in the beginning, we both had our guards up, like... Mm-hmm. ...very high. I'm sweating. When did you feel like you started to let your guard down a little bit? See who you really are. Your guard's still up? I asked you a question. When did you start to let your guard down? I feel like it went back up, recently. What do you mean by that? When did you put your guard back up? I just wanna be careful. You're so negative. - Just enjoy the moment. - I'm not getting my hopes up here. Don't get your hopes up. Just enjoy the moment. I'm trying to. You said you don't think about the future. I don't! But everyone's asking us, "What's next for you guys? What are you gonna do now?" "What'll happen when you get back?" I don't know! Nobody knows. After I self-declared that we're boyfriend and girlfriend, I know that that created a lot of what's going on in her head. It was almost a reset of, "Now the guards are back up" because I did something stupid. When we were finally able to leave, it was really bittersweet. It was more than a vacation. It was something I would never forget. I wasn't ready to go home and pretend all of that didn't just happen. Bye, Costa Rica. Gonna miss this view. Guys, we're leaving. Can't believe it. I can't believe I'm semi-on time. If the flight goes, we're really going back to Estados Unidos after three months. It's gonna go, okay? I was like, "Are we in too deep with all these interviews?" And, "Am I stuck with this guy? What are we doing when we get back?" We never really talked about what happens after. What if we did just go our separate ways? Khani's frustrated with me 'cause people are recognizing us at the airport. I don't want to be recognized. Coming up to us, wishing us well. You're a little Costa Rican celebrity. - Can I have your autograph, please? - Shut up. - You want some help? - No! I don't need you!
