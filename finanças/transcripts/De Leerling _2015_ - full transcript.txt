Benny, can I talk to you? I'm going to town. But I have time now, so will you walk with me? Sit down. How are you? I'm fine. Did you like school a little? Are you getting along well with your new classmates? What do you want from me? Alright Benny, um... I'm a little worried about you. I know you've only been here for a few weeks... and that you have to get used to it, but you can't seem to find your turn. Your behavior towards fellow students... You know what I'm talking about, right? Hey, how can I help you? You don't want to help me. I do not believe you. Benny... We're talking about your future here. I checked last week's exam and you... rated as one of the few inadequate. What do you really want from me? I have a meeting now, so I have to go. Uh...just think about it. Are we going to eat like that, Mama? Yes, honey, almost. Okay. Okay. [STUDENTS VOICE EACH OTHER] Benny! Let's agree that this will NEVER happen, shall we? I... I can kick you out of school for this, you get that! Is it true that Benny... You are playing with fire. But you want me too. Let me explain to you. I don't have any... love for my students. You are children. I want to see you. This afternoon, after school. No. Excuse me. It shouldn't have happened. [LISTEN TO MEN'S SONG] They won't do it the first time, come on. I don't want this. Forget me. Please forget it. King! King, come on! King! Come. Mother? Hi. Hey. What happened to your car? Oh, my God, that's so stupid. I used to um... drove too close to a lamppost. Light poles? And then such a scratch? - Yes. Could happen, right? Your tea is cold. Yes, I will make it soon. Well, the task is to write a cover letter. For your favorite internship. And then art... to properly explain why you are right for the position. I want you to use the same format we practiced last week. Are there any questions? Esmee, how much longer? It's not about how much, but what you write. Let's start. I have another question. Yes Benny? Do you have to eat director to get a job at this school? [LAUGHTER IN CLASS] Benny... I don't think this is funny, really. Just go to management. CLASS: Whooooeee! Do you like to lick it? [LAUGH] Shake! [LAUGH] [HARD AND LAMB] Calm! Either you or I get out. [LAUGHTER AND DISCONTINUED IN CLASS] Who did that? [LAUGHING AND CHEERING] [CHEERING] And from the hole in the stick came out ... PHONE Ward! [TELEPHONE] Telephone! A long, thin, and shining sword appeared from the hole in the staff. I stabbed him with my epee... PHONE [TELEPHONE] With Lana. [SILENCE] Who am I talking to? SHUT UP [SOMEONE LYING] Who's that? I don't know, maybe it's a typo. [TELEPHONE] [PHONE] What are you doing now? The phone is broken. [PHONE ERROR TONE] [STUDENT VOICES] [VOICE IS ALWAYS LOADED HIGHER] [STUDENT VOICES] [STUDENT SOUND BLOWING] Do you have a minute? Lana, say. I declared sick. I don't feel comfortable at all. Do I have to arrange for someone to drive you home? No, I'll be fine. Certain? Yes. If so, get well soon. How is today? Nothing special. I've been teaching all day. Oh yeah, and this afternoon I was... an appraisal interview. Oh, and? It went really well. They are very satisfied with me. I'll be getting the scales there soon. Oh, how beautiful! Yes. How was your day? Good. Okay, honey, I'm leaving. Have fun, hey. See you again. See you again. I want you to go back to school. I miss you. Don't. No. Do you want something to drink? No, thank you. Hey... I've been dreaming... It really keeps me busy all the time. It's summer and I'm swimming ... and you, and Raja threw the ball on the beach. And it starts very gently. Something... pull me down. And I tried to swim to shore but I couldn't go forward. And I panic... and the force pulling me down grew stronger. And then I got sucked into the water. And... I'm so afraid of suffocation. I was really... really really scared. And of course I tried to swim up but... I'm not that strong enough. ... if you need to go to a museum, do something 'cultural'. Then the plan is to do something 'on'. Canoeing, karting... [CONVERSATION DISAPPEARS INTO BACKGROUND] What do you think, what the staff outing ended up being. I really do not know. Some food in Chinese restaurant. And then the BOWL. It was a very original idea (!) I also said it to Eva. Do you know how the reaction... Good huh? One two... Aaah! Tree! Whaaaaa! [SOUND OF RAIN AND STORM] [SCHOOL BELL] [SAVE PACKAGE AND GO] Here, what do you think of this booklet for Kim? Hey? May I use this? Didn't we agree to only buy gifts for Kim? please? You should now stop whining. What do you think of this book for Kim? But he is very cute. I'm clear! King, you shouldn't point at you like that. I never got anything from you! Now I'm fed up. Come on King, let's go. King? King! King! Oh, Jesus. WOMAN: It was three-quarters of an hour ago? Now he ran here. Let's first list the possibilities carefully. Where is the King at? He breathed frantically [TELEPHONE] Ma'am, we'll find him. Hee Ward, the King is gone. I was at the bookstore and we were looking at the pictures from the security cameras. WARD: What's all this? The king is here with me. What? Oh, Jesus Christ. All right, go home first. Lana? Yes, I'm coming, I'm coming. He is at home. He is at home. Excuse me. That's not a problem at all. (TICKLE OF CUTLERY ON SIGNS) Have you been looking for it for a long time? No, it's not bad. What would you worry about. Kings don't run in seven submissions at the same time. You did very well. Dear king. Nice. Don't you want something? - No, I'm full. [WATCH] [WATCH] THE SOUND became LOUDER [WATCH] Hey! [DOOR BEEPS] [BONKS DOOR] [BONKS DOOR] Lana? [SCOOTER TURNED ON] [SHOUT]
