Righto, let's do this. Right. You wouldn't believe the amount of shit that's about to go down. We don't have time to fuck around so I'm going to make this really, really simple. Thousands of years ago, when the first ancient man started sacrificing animals to the gods... They unwittingly opened a portal that brought demons into this world. The demons possessed the humans, took over their bodies like parasites and started doing unspeakable things. Dealing out violence and death devouring souls with an insatiable appetite. Things looked grim. Then came the Nekromancers. Bad-arse demon hunters with magic in their veins and big, fuck-off weapons in their hands. They've been kicking each other's arses now for thousands of years. But recently, some evil son of a bitch worked out a way to blast demons inside the internet. Now, they can get you through your phones. You get all that? Good. Rangi! Stop! Stop! Turn it off! Rangi, turn it off! - Oh, shit! - Turn it off! Ohh! Shit. Shit! You said it, bro. What are you watching? It's a donkey trying to have sex with a phone box. It's pretty funny. Why would you watch that? - Why wouldn't you watch that? - I don't wanna watch that. Howard, what are you doing standing around in your jocks for? I'm working on my tan. You dickheads are gonna have to take Dad's shift. He's hungover again. He couldn't be bothered. No, no, no, we've just come off a 17-hour shift. We haven't even slept yet. Mum says you gotta do it. It's a PFYD. What's a PFYD? A problem for you dickheads. Genius. This is bullshit! No, it's human shit, mate. That's how we pay the rent. So, I suggest you two butt monkeys get in that truck and start driving. See you losers later. Yeah, so you're brother's kind of a dick, eh? Foster brother. Life is one big party when you're still young But who's gonna have your back when it's all done? It's all good when you're little You have pure fun Can't be a fool son, what about the long run? Come on, sing it! Girl, you're my angel You're my darling angel Shaggy! Oh shit! I got it! I got it! Get it! Ah, fuck! Ow! Stop! That is disgusting! No, man, it's just nature. "Do you want to play a game "that will change your life forever?" Oh, okay. Yeah. Hell, yeah! Game activated. Shh. Scanning for ghosts. No ghosts detected. - Hey, Rangi! - Ah! What the fuck you doin', man? Come on. - Ah, shit! - Get inside the cab, man. Stupid. What are you doing? I'm looking for ghosts. You're supposed to be able to see ghosts with this thing, but I can't see shit. Like, dead people ghosts? Yeah. It's like that game with those weird little monsters you have to collect. - What? - You're supposed to find them and catch them with your phone. Cool, man. Why are you always playing on that thing for? What else am I supposed to do on a three-hour road trip? How about a conversation? With me? Verbal communication. The sharing of information via the mouth. - You remember that? - Ew. You want to share something with me via your mouth? Well, not when you say it like that, no. But the conversation part, yes. Okay, then. Let's have a conversation. - Go ahead. - Okay. Uh... - Mmm-hmm. - Play. Ghosts detected. - Stop the truck! - Whoa! Shit! Oh, shit! Oh, yeah, baby! Oh, would you look at this thing? - Ghost detected. - It's a ghost! The graphics on this thing are sick. Bro, check this out. You have got to be kidding me, man. I thought we hit a dog or something! What is wrong with you? Fuck it, the phone? So, how do I catch this thing? Double tap to capture. Yep. Oh, snap! Did you see... Oh, shit! Dude, you all right? What happened? I dunno. I just had a stabbing pain in the back of my neck. - Could be a brain tumor. - It's not a brain tumor. - It could... - Definitely not a brain tumor. Okay... Oh, dude, take it easy with the pills, man. Remember that time you got wasted and you took too many? Started yelling about space aliens and shit? Then, you punched my aunty. That was one time. What the shit is that? Uh... Nekropod. Ah, I read about these. They have them all over the place. They're like super-duper transmitter thingies or something. That's why the graphics are so sweet. Wait, that thing's a part of your shitty, little phone game? That reminds me. There should be a wraith, up there somewhere. Oh, dude... Dude! Check that shit out. That thing's freaking me out, man. Yeah, it's crazy, huh? Come on, let's get out of here. Ah! Good afternoon, ma'am. How are you? Ginsberg. You're not wearing your Santa hat. Much better. Now... Nekropods. Update. Yeah, the Nekropods, yes. The new battery units you have supplied are being installed. After the launch of the game last week, we estimate the amount of devices that have uploaded the application to be... 1.3 million. Excuse me for a second. I, ah... If anything goes wrong, I kill every single person in that room. Start the engine. Nekromancers going offline all over the city. Couldn't find anybody out there. They're either blocked or they're dead. It's Finnegan. Offline. Right, so she's finally made a move. - Oh, man! - Ghost. Dude, there's fricking ghosts everywhere. Come on, pull over. Let me get my score up. No, I am not stopping this truck again so you can play fricking video games, man! Pull your head out of your arse! Pull your head out of your arse. Get your head out of your... Oh, shit! Entity unknown. Whoa! Dude, what the fuck! What the hell is wrong with you? Dude, what's wrong with you? You've got all this weird, freaky shit going on, man. - Entity unknown. - Whoa! Hey, you're not a ghost though, are you, bro? Like, you would tell me if you were a ghost, right? I'm about to turn you into a ghost, you fucking cock-knocker! I nearly crashed the truck, Rangi! What the fuck is wrong with you, man? You scared the shit out of me! What are you doing? What are you doing now? - Double tap to play. - I'm just gonna try something. Rangi, listen, you've gotta stop this shit, all right? Unknown. Unknown. Unknown. Unknown. What is that? The signal's off the charts. Who the hell is that? Oh, it can't be. It can't be possible. Oh, fuck! Dude, what the fuck happened to you? What'd you do to me? I was just messing around on my phone, and then fuckin' shit gone mental, bro! What the hell? What happened? Howie! You got blood comin' out of your ears, bro. Can't be good for you, bro! Let's get you to a hospital. Howie! What the fuck's your problem? I'm trying to help you, man! Oh, you've gotta be kidding me. Rip... Tear... Kill... Eat. Tell me you're seeing this. Yeah, I'm seeing this, bro. No! Get back! No, no, no! Don't do it! Oh! Fuck! Fuck it! Run! Run! Don't! No, no, no! Do it! Oh, shit. It's my bad, bro! It's him. Dude! Yo, dude! Howard, come on, buddy. Come on, buddy. Howie! Howie! Check that out. Wow. That's old tech, huh? Certainly is. That thing's been inside him longer than you've been alive. Right. Put the new one in. Ahh! Oh, fuck! What the fuck did you just put into me? What the hell is going on? Huh? Who are you people? Well, my name's Luther. These are my daughters. This is Torquel and Molly. Now, as to your previous question, it's called a scrambler. It's a new version. With that safely inserted in your head, hopefully they won't be able to find you. What? You got some pretty weird friends, bro. Ahh! What'd you do that for? Take a seat. No, I don't want to take a seat. Please, sit down. Howard, you're a Nekromancer. You're a demon hunter, like us. Come again. You're one of the last surviving members of the most powerful bloodlines our kind has ever known. You know, back in the day, your mother and father... Wait a minute. Sorry, hang on, wait a minute. So, you know my parents? My actual parents? I knew your parents. Henry and Finnegan. Your mother, she came from one of the great European Nekromancer dynasties. Tremendously powerful family. And she could perform exorcisms with her bare hands. With your father, she killed thousands of demons. And they were the first ones to discover demon activity online. The old bastards were all through the web like a virus, corrupting souls faster than ever. But Henry and Finnegan devised a way to blast their souls inside the internet. That way, we could track and exterminate the swine faster than ever. But Finnegan spent too much time online. And the demons got to her. Corrupted her completely. She became a soul eater, feeding on her own people like a crack addict from hell. Each soul she ate brought her closer to immortality and ultimate power. She even went after you. But your father got there first. He scooped you up. He tried to hide you where she wouldn't find you and by the time we caught up with him, he was dead. Murdered by wraiths. Well, we assumed you were dead, too. What happened to my mother? She's still around. Your mother was the one that sent that axe maniac to chop your head off. She's been killing all the Nekromancers in the city. Taking their heads. Every single person we know... Dead. And your father made this. I believe Henry put this scrambler in you to keep you safe. But you came home today, Howard. You came home the very day that she comes out of hiding and kills every able-bodied Nekromancer in the city, except for us, and you. You're here for a reason, Howard. What the fuck are you doing? I'm just updating my status. Tell me you don't have the game on this. - I don't. - You do. - Yeah I do but... - You motherfucker! That's my fricking phone! They're in the building. We have to get out of here. Now. No, don't. Rangi. Rangi! Rangi! What the fuck was that? Get him out of here. I'll hold them off. Not a chance. Go! Now! Get up! Get up! Come on, Howard. Tor, we have to move. - Hi, Luther. - Oh! Finnegan. Long time no see. Where is he? Oh, he'll find you. Good. Hey, Luther. Merry Christmas. Hey! Get in. They were dead already, Howard. Come on. We gotta go. Hey! Get in the van. Howard, get in the van. Now. Shit! Howard! Stop! Hey, bro. So, I think I'm a ghost now. It's not too bad, actually. I can teleport into the shadows and stuff, and I can stretch my face like a mofo. Check this out. - Yeah, pretty disgusting, huh? - Very. So I went for a cruise around before. There's, like, ghosts everywhere. But they're, like, retarded or something. But I'm different. I think that's because you did something to me. See, wherever I go, I keep getting pulled back here to you. - Why is that? - I don't... I don't know. You okay, Mr. North? My dead friend just flew down off the ceiling and ripped his face off. No, I'm not okay. Are you seeing this? Hmm? Seeing what? Dude, he can't see shit. I'm a fricking ghost. Hey, what the hell happened to all the hot nurses? This guy looks like someone slapped some hair on a penis. You didn't hear that? Hear what? The thing about the penis. I'll get the doctor. Watch this. What is that? This is a hallucination brought on by stress. I'm a hallucination now, am I? Yes, correct. Yes, you are. - Can a hallucination do this? - No, no! What? Now, they're gonna think I did that. - So? - Can you just please go and haunt somebody else? I am not feeling very good. How do you think I'm feeling? I'm dead. And I gotta hang out with your boring ass. I don't even have my phone. It's your goddamn phone that got us into this mess in the first place! What the fuck am I doing? I'm arguing with a figment of my imagination. Hey, who are you calling a figment, you... Something's coming. "Howard North. "Driver's license registered to Plumpton." That place is a dump. You're telling me. Are you sure you're my doctor? You're on anti-psychotics. Crazy pills. How long have you been on those for? - Since I was a kid. - Why? I have a tendency to put people in hospitals. And sometimes, I, uh, see shit that isn't there. Who said it isn't there? You look like your father. Sounds like you got my temperament. That's interesting. You've gone white as a ghost. How's your temperature? You're my mother. Nice to meet you, mon amour. The same one that killed all those people and sucked out their souls, then abandoned me as a child and murdered my father? That mother? Well, I mean, sure, I did some of that shit. But that was a dark time for me. But I'll tell you one thing. I never, and I mean never, abandoned you. Did you send someone out to chop my head off with an axe? Okay. Okay! I'll cop to that. But I had no idea that was you at the time. What kind of a monster do you think I am? Those aren't going to help you. How would you know? How the fuck would you know? You're a murdering psychopath. You've been talking to the wrong people. Those Nekromancers are full of shit. Yeah, well, I think you're full of shit. Take my hand. Do it. Come on. Do you feel that? That's more power than you've ever conceived in your small lifetime. And it's not even the tip of the iceberg. Howard, I am your mother, and I've missed you, and I love you very much. And what I'm offering is a lot more fun. There is a scrambler unit in the back of your head. I want you to take that cable and plug it in. Then what happens? Then the pain goes away and everything becomes peaches and cream, and fun, fun, fun, forever. Uh, is there a soul in that box? Don't be a pussy, Howard! Just plug in the fucking cable! You're either coming with us, or you're going with her. I'll come with you. This is all actually happening, isn't it? Yeah, this is actually happening. My mother just tried to force-feed me a soul through a hole in the back of my head. Really? Well, I'm glad she didn't. If she did, we'd have to force-feed a bullet through a hole in the front of your head. I'm seeing a lot of dead people right now. Don't worry. You get used to the freaky shit. - Are we safe up here? - Yeah, don't worry. It's a safe zone. We've got scramblers all over the place. Wraith. What? No fucking way. Where? - Molly, where is it? - It's there! - It's over there. - Wait, wait, wait! - Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! - Hey, hey! What the hell are you doing? That is my friend! That's my friend. Look, I come in peace, okay? So, don't blast me. Great. You bring your phone this time, dickhead? - No. - Good. Well, well, well. Looks like Howard here's made himself a wraith. I'm a wraith? I thought I was a ghost. What's the difference? You're like a ghost on steroids. What is that? That's why we're here. Come on. They're ghosts being sucked into Nekropods. And all that energy is pouring into the network, directly into the hands of you-know-who. - Who? - Your mother, Finnegan. Who do you think? Well, how am I supposed to know? Okay. Check this out. This is a map of the city. The Nekropods are forming a giant pentagram. A pentagram is a summoning symbol. Shit. Sorry. It's kind of addictive. - Come on, man. - Okay. Put this on. All right, straight ahead. At the foot of that building, about halfway up the wall. Do you see it? Ah, Nekropod, yeah. Look we're going to get that Nekropod, open it up, find out what's under the hood. Wanna come with? - Um... - "Um" is not an answer. Just give me a minute, please. Okay, we don't have a minute, hotshot. Just listen... No, you listen. You listen. I just found out that I'm part of some weird, little, anti-satanic superhero club. And that my mother killed my father and a whole lot of other people and ate their fuckin' souls! And because of that, I've spent my entire life growing up in shitty foster homes thinking I was Oliver Twist, but, apparently, I'm Merlin the fuckin' Magician. Demons are trying to kill me through phones, with axes. Somebody tried to suck my soul directly through my face today. And now, you're asking me to help you steal a thing off a wall that is guarded by, arguably, the scariest fucking thing I have ever seen in my entire life. Well, excuse me if I need a little time. Just give me a fuckin' minute. Ooh! You should give him a minute. Sure. I'll give you a minute. Why don't I give you the same minute it took for our father to die for your arse? Tor, be cool. Running is not an option. Not for any of us. She is going to find us, and she is going to kill us. Howard, our Dad said you were here for a reason. Give me one day. Let me train you. See what you got. Besides, you got anything better to do? Come on. Whoa! They've got their own batcave! This is a Killstation. It's like a slaughterhouse for demons. Don't be scared Howard. This is a safe zone. Meet your new sparring partner. I saw you push a demon through a landline cable with your bare hands today so I bet you pack a hell of a punch. Like, hit it? Like, uh... No, not with your hands, Howard. Like that. Uh... Right? Hmm. I don't know what to do. You have to take this seriously. I am. I just... I can't! I'm gonna shit my pants. I'm gonna shit my pants. Let's try something smaller. Close your eyes. Just relax. Slow and steady. Do you feel that? Yeah, I do. That's right. Just like that. Yes. Open your eyes. Hit the bag. Shit! I'll get you another one. This is a Nekroportal. You push a demon spirit into this thing and summon it up as a real-life demon through that goopy, liquid stuff. Like a 3D printer for demons, hmm? Something like that. And whatever you do, don't put a naked flame anywhere near that thing. - Why? - It goes boom. Whoa! Superhero battle armor! Fricking sick! These are anti-possession suits. Anytime you're inside a pentagram with an active demon, you must be wearing one or that thing is gonna try and jump straight inside your head, and if it gets in too deep, then we're gonna have to, you know... - Kill you. - Great. Whoa. There's a demon inside each one of these things. We call them trap boxes. We push the demon out of the human host and seal them inside. This one here is a nasty, little fucker. So what you gotta do is push the demon out of the trap box through those cables, down into the portal. Then, when you see that thing light up like a Christmas tree, you summon it up. Just summon it up, just like that, huh? Yeah. You'll know what to do. - All right. Okay. - Trust me. Hmm. Uh, and then what do we do? Then Old Betsi takes care of the rest. Who's Old Betsi? This is Old Betsi. Whenever you're ready. So, I just push the thing down into the portal, then it's, uh, Christmas lights, then summon, right? That's right, stud. We'll take it from there. Ow! Fuck it! Oh, Jesus! Hey! Breathe. Just relax. Let it happen. Yeah, okay. All right. I got this. I got this. Demon 786, offline. Little bastard. - Hey, Lurch. - Hmm. - Get your crew ready. - Yes, madam. Okay, here's the plan. There's an electrical tunnel system below the city that leads directly to an isolated pod. We're gonna load up the plasma guns. Do I get a plasma gun? You're a wraith, douchebag. How're you gonna hold one? I don't know, I thought you guys'd have a ghost gun or something, you know? - Where was I? - Plasma guns. Right. We're gonna load 'em up. We're gonna make our way through the tunnels quick smart. There's an access point about 15 meters from the Nekropod, right there. Torquel goes out first. She takes out the wraith. Shouldn't I now take out the wraith? You're not ready for that yet. I could lead her off on a goose chase - while you guys do your thing. - A goose chase? Hey, no one's doing any goose chasing. Torquel's gonna blast the wraith and then, right after that, I need you to detonate the thumper. Wait a minute. What's a thumper? An EMP bomb. Shuts down all the phones in the area. Means your darling Mummy can't send any demons. - It'll buy us some time. - Cool. Then I go and get the pod, we both jump back in the tunnels, and we run like hell. Any questions? Yeah. What do I do? You do fuck all. Just try and stay out of the way, But if you see any geese, chase 'em. - There it is. - Right. Give me the thumper. Oh. Uh... That's armed. When this thing kicks, it fricking kicks. So be ready. Hold this. That's the detonator. Do not push that button until I give you the signal. - Okay. - Excuse me. What is the signal? Right. You okay? I'm holding an EMP detonator in my hand. No, I'm not okay. All right. What do you want, some reassurance? What I want is for you to look me in the face and tell me everything's going to be super sweet. That's what I want. That's what I would like. Everything's gonna be sweet. Super sweet? Super sweet. Hey! Loverboy! We only have one shot at this, so don't fuck it up. Okay. I'll see you on the flipside. Don't miss, bitch. As if. You heard the man. Don't fuck it up. Thank you. Oh, shit. What the fuck did you do? Oh, shit! Sorry, bro. Fucking Howard! Go. Now! Did I hit it? Yello? Rangi! Rangi! Rangi. Hey, Rangi! Rangi... You had one job. I had that. Shit. Run. Howard. I really don't like you hanging around with these types of girls, Howard. They're inappropriate. I see you've got your own pet wraith now. Cute. I'm going to give you one last chance and then it's no more Mrs. Nice Guy. Come on, Howard. Come home. Fuck you, Mum. "Fuck you, Mum"? It's the best I could do. Oh, dude! Look what she did to my face! Little fucking shit! Come on. Come on! Pod missing. Pod missing. Installing new Nekropod. Installing new Nekropod. Pod replaced. - Oh. - How do I look? - Good. Really good. - Better? Mmm, much better, actually. It's a... It's a head. Who the hell is that? That's Uncle Dave. - You know this guy? - Yeah. Yeah, it's Uncle Dave. Why's his head in there? Turn it on. - Well, are you sure that's... - Turn it on. David? Can you hear me? Molly. Is that you? Yes. Yes, yes, it's me. You fucking whore! Slut! Foul witch! Oh, God, I'm so sorry. Molly, they make me say these things. - Think these things... - Fuck you! Suck my dick! Eat my shit! Oh, god dammit, I can't control myself! Cocksucker! Lick my face through an anus! You know, he kind of reminds me of my uncle. David, why has Finnegan done this to you? Feeding us dead souls. Making us... She's making us eat them. Filling us with power. Unclean power. "Us"? But what do you mean, "us"? There's more of you? All of us... Shut the fuck up, bitch! All of us! Are you saying every Nekropod has a Nekromancer head inside? Yes. Why would she do that? - She's using us... - Arse! Fuck! Camel tit! Fuck up! Using our combined power to summon a million human souls into the network. How? Through the game. What's she gonna do with a million souls, Dave? Feed on them. With that much power, she'll be able to possess the entire internet. Whoa. She'll have access to every fucking soul on Earth. How long have we got? Not long. You have to hurry. Molly! Set me free, Molly. Set me free. Please! Your heads are next, you fucking whores! Molly! We need to get access to her security systems. What's the plan? I'm gonna jump myself in. I'm gonna jump inside the network. Pentagram 85 percent complete. Do you hear that, Luther? Our pentagram is nearly complete. Do you know what that means? It means we suck their souls. I'm going to be beautiful forever, and you'll just be a fucking head in a box. Double tap to capture. Oh, shit! Whoa! I thought Molly was jumping in. Hey, what are you doing? Bring me back. What, no! She's inside the network. I'm gonna jump her back out. Wait, wait, wait. If she's already inside, then maybe we should give her a chance. She's doing it. She made it in. Security breach. Security breach. Security breach. Security breach. Nearly there. Nearly. Shit. Shit. Shit. We gotta get her out of there. Get out of the way. Get out of the way! You pull her back in. Pull her back in! - How? - Please try, now! - Okay! - Please! Come on! What did you do? What the fuck happened to her head? Hey, Howie. We gotta get out of here, man. Should be me lying there. That wouldn't do anybody any good. Could have stopped her. Jumped her out sooner. I pushed too hard. I fucked up. I... No, that's not fair. I practically forced you into it. This is on me. Now she's dead. Now they're all fucking dead. I had her. I was so close. But I panicked. I pushed her away as hard as I could because for a second there, I could taste her. I could taste her soul. And it tasted good. My sister's soul tasted good to you? No. No, no, no. That's not what I meant, no. No, I... I didn't, um... My sister's soul tasted good to you. Molly, please, that's not what I meant. And then her fucking head explodes? You know what? I don't know who the fuck you are, Howard North. You turn up out of the blue, and now everybody's dead. All I know about you is that you are related to a crazy, twisted, psychotic freak! I don't know where you've been the last 20 years. How do I know you're not working for her? Like mother, like son. A filthy fucking soul eater! Maybe I should just shoot you in the head right fucking now! Maybe you should. Go ahead. Do it. You either trust me or you don't. Oh. Hey! Hi. Your sister just wanted me to tell you to stop whining like a couple of bitches, and get her the hell out of the box. That's all. He's right. - She's in there. - And she's pissed. Well, how do we get her out of there? I don't know. I've never seen this shit before. There has to be a way to get her out. - I don't know it. - Well, you... Why don't we just use the 3D printer? Anybody ever tried this before? No, not with human souls. How does it feel? Kinda funky. Did the upload complete? No. All the data was corrupted. Don't worry. I've memorized her entire system. Everything. All of it. It's all up here. Burn it. "Thanks for bringing me back from the dead, huh." "Oh, you're welcome, Torquel." Oh, fuck! Fuck! The good news is... I have a plan. There it is. Come on. I don't think you got it. Hey! Hey, how about this? I'll go and hook us up to the mainframe, and you keep this fuckin' thing off our backs. - Deal? - Deal. - Be careful, okay? - Okay. Three, two, one. Pentagram 100% complete. Disco. You okay? Yeah. Come on. - Do you think she'll make it? - She has to. Ah. No, no, no, no! No! She's killing them all. She did it. She fuckin' blew herself up. It didn't work. She's trying to force her way out. What are you doing? Molly... You just have to push her out. Now wait a minute. Push her out of what? Me. I trust you. Molly, no! No, no! No, Molly! Molly! No! Molly! Molly. Molly. Molly. Who's been a naughty boy, then? Do you have any idea how hard I worked to make all this happen? And you and your little bitch whore just fucked it all up for me! Go ahead. Punch a hole in your girlfriend. See if I care. Why couldn't you have just stayed under whatever rock your father buried you under? It's going to take me years and years and years to clean up all this shit. And I know what that feels like. Come, give Mama a kiss. Dude, you're gonna need heaps and heaps and heaps of therapy after this. Uh-huh. Whoa! Slow and steady. - Yeah? - All right. Are you okay? Did it work? Yeah, I think we got her. Let's take the bitch out. Are you okay with what we're about to do? Like the whole 3D printing of my mother, and shooting her with a plasma-powered bazooka thing? Yeah, fine. - Mmm-hmm. - Just fuck off! Oh! I mean, when we bring her up out of there, she isn't gonna look like your mother. Her soul is about as corrupted as you can get. It's gonna be ugly. Shoot it! No! No! Molly! Molly! Molly, now! You brought me back. - Yeah, of course I did. - Thanks. Don't mention it. Ooh. What'd I miss? Where in the name of fuck did I leave my car? Babe? Babe? Suck on this. Fuck off!
