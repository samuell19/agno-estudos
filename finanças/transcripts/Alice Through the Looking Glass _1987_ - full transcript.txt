* * (meowing) * You can't go out, Cinder. I can't go out either. We're prisoners. I don't know what we'll do for another whole day indoors. * (laughing) I know you're smart, Cinder, but you can't play chess. * I know. Let's pretend we're in Egypt and I'm the queen. I'll order thousands of my men to build the biggest pyramid in the world. No. We pretended that yesterday. Alice? Hi Daddy. I have to go out on a call. Is it important? Very. There's a baby over at the Clinton place wanting to get into this world. I've gotta help it get in. I'll get my fur coat and snow boots. No, wait. I can't take you this time. But there's a terrible blizzard. I know, that's why I can't take you. George Hanson is going with me. The roads may be in bad shape. We could get stuck. I can shovel snow. You're my favorite driving companion. But you just stay inside here where it's nice and warm this time. I'll be back in time for our nightly chess game, okay? Okay. I hope the baby's a girl. And I hope you didn't jinx me. I promised a boy. * Hmmm, I'll just figure out a real neat chess move to beat Daddy tonight. There, that'll make him scratch. (clunking) Oh, Cinder. You ruined it. Now where did I have the white queen? I wish I were a queen like you. If I were a queen, I'd ride around my kingdom on my noble steed, and make everything beautiful. * I'd order all blizzards to stop, and I'd command it to be nice every day. * (meowing) I'd order the grass to grow and all flowers to bloom right in the middle of winter. I'd make the sun shine all day long and there'd be a full moon every night. Oh, it's like looking through a window into another land. It's so beautiful. If only I could get through the glass to the other side. (thunder crashing) * What's happening? The glass is going all soft. My hand goes right through it. I wonder... * (meowing) * * I'm on the other side of the looking glass, and I'm not just pretending! * * I can hardly believe my eyes * * I really don't know what to think * * It's all such a lovely surprise, and it's happened as quick as a wink * * It doesn't seem like a dream * * No I'm sure it's real though it's hard to understand * * Still I feel so happy here in looking glass land * * I love it * It's so wonderful looking around * Oh look! * I really don't know what to say * * 'Cause this colorful land that I've found wasn't here when I woke up today * * It doesn't seem like a dream * * No, I'm sure it's real though it's hard to understand * * Still I feel so happy here in looking glass land * * In looking glass land * I wonder if there are any people in this beautiful land. * You're very pretty, but what are you? Are you a bird? Is that what birds look like in this land? * Are you some kind of animal? * I'm some kind of a magician. You really are. Who are you? I'm Tom Fool, royal court jester and magician to her highness, the White Queen in the first square. White Queen in the first square? That sounds like a chess game. Of course. This is Chessland. Oh, good. I play chess with my father all the time. Ahhh, then you know why I had to sneak up on you the way I did. We can't let anyone from the Red King and Queen side sneak into our square, you know. Well, I'm not from their side. I'm Alice. And I'm from the other side of the looking glass. How about that? We hardly ever get any tourists. You mean other people do come here through the looking glass sometimes? Well, to be honest, you're the first one. Oh, wow, this is something special. Would you show me around, please? Hey wait. I amuse, I mystify, I entertain. I don't do guided tours. Then just tell me what to see! If you'll pardon me, I think I'll disappear again. Don't leave! You're the first person I've seen and I don't know which way to go! Ah well, come on. I'll take you to the top of the hill, where you can see all the land. Thank you. * Tom, wait! * What's the matter? I can't keep up with you. You've got to run faster. I'm running as fast as I can, but I'm not getting anywhere. In this land, if you just run as fast as you can, you stay in the same place. You've got to run faster than you can. That's impossible. * * Now running faster than you can is really simple as can be * * Try going slower first and then just do the opposite you see * * If you think it can't be done the problem's only in your mind * * So all you have to do is change it and you'll find that nothing is impossible * * No, nothing is impossible at all * * Now you may think that isn't so * * Ah, but I've seen enough to know * * That nothing is impossible at all * * No, nothing is impossible at all * * * Now getting north by heading south is such an easy trick to learn * * Just don't forget before you get there to return * * While falling up is elementary when you're outside in your room * * And you'd agree at once if you would just assume * * That nothing is impossible * * No, nothing is impossible at all * * Now you may think that isn't so * * Ah, but I've seen enough to know that nothing is impossible at all * * No nothing is impossible at all * Nothing is impossible. Never been done maybe. But anything you can think of is possible. Well, I can think I'm on top of that hill, but I'm not. Think hard. * There, ya did it. That was wonderful. You can see most of our land from here. It's just like a chessboard. Right, and you're in the white square. You always start in the white square you know. But I don't see any kings or queens or knights and castles and pawns. They're down there. Oh, I'd love to join them. I wouldn't mind being a pawn. That's easy. You're a pawn. But I'd much rather be a queen. I've always wanted to be a queen. Oh, that's harder. You have to go all the way across the land to square eight. And then you'll be made a queen. I can do that. You'll have to get the White Queen's permission first. I'll ask her right away. She doesn't grant audiences. You work for the White Queen. It's not work. I amuse and entertain her. Couldn't you just take me with you when you go in to see her? Sure, why not? If she gets mad, I can always say you're a spy I caught. C'mon. * The White Queen's castle looks like an eagle's nest. The queen's got claws like an eagle, and she screeches like one. She sounds scary. She's mostly bark and no bite. Let's go. (knocking) * May we enter, your majesties? Tom Fool. Where have you been? I've been calling for you. I've been patrolling your territory, milady, searching for spies. Well if you nab one, haul 'em in and we'll have a real ball. It's so boring around this gold-plated mausoleum. Boring. You wish entertainment, madam? I could use a couple of chuckles. I don't get a whole lot of laughs just sitting here looking at old fireball over there. He moved! If he'd sat there much longer like that, I was gonna have him bronzed. Now amuse me, Fool. * Hey, no acrobatics! They don't amuse me. * And no juggling, you dolt. That went out with vaudeville. Give me a laugh, something that'll hit me right here. * Today we have some really big, big stars that are gonna give you a really big, big show. * Some women have brains instead of beauty. What's your excuse, madam? * Hey, how's about-a you and me, we get a coupla pizzas, ha toots? Whatdya say? * (honking) * Stop this nonsense at once! Do one of your magic tricks. Something super spectacular. * Gazook. Fronk and wangdoodle. Pollywog. Hoof and poof. Oink and lapis. * This is amateur night. I saw how you did that trick. You had this beast up your sleeve. Now, make it go away. Wifdiddle. * That's a gas. (laughing) I always knew Wizzer had termites in his crown, but not mice. I just noticed there are two of you. Who's this other young boy you brought with you today, Tom? Present him at once. My name is Alice, your majesty. I'm not a boy, I'm a girl. You can't be. You're wearing pants. These are jeans. Jeans, Joes, Jims, I don't care who they belong to. They're pants. And boys wear pants. Lots of girls wear jeans today, ma'am. Disgusting. When I was your age, I wore beautiful frilly dresses, and my hair in a long braid down the back with a big bow. You must've been a very pretty little girl. A-ha! You're a wily one. But you have tact, diplomacy. We can use you. Maybe we'll make you our new ambassador. Whatdya think of that, Flash? (whistling) Get with it, Tiger. Oh, yes, yes, well my dear, I feel-- Good, I'm glad you feel. (laughing) For a minute I thought you weren't even breathing. Sharp as a razor that one. Maybe we should make her the new prime minister. How does that grab ya, Swifty? If you really want my advice-- That'll be the day. Just nod your head for approval. (snoring) That's giving it the old pizzazz, Slugger. (laughing) It's done. Now come up here, child, and let me appoint you prime minister. But I don't wanna be a prime minister, your majesty. I wanna be a queen. You're not as bright as I thought you were. You know what it takes to be a queen? Tom told me. I have to go all the way from square one to square eight, with your permission. It's not easy. The Red King and Queen will try to stop you with their evil tricks all along the way. I can make it. You'll meet some loonies, not normal well-adjusted characters like us. There's this joker on square five called Humpty Dumpty, flaky, a real air-head. Oh, I know all about Humpty Dumpty. Huh! Wait till you get to square six and seven. You know all about dragons and krakens and griffins and hydras and ogres and gorgens? I've never seen any. Well, you'll see plenty. Keep a close eye out for the Jabberwock, he's a real creep. Oh, if you really make it to the Red Queen's square, and she has to crown you, it'll blow her mind. And you're giving your permission? Yes, yes, child. Go! Let Tom Fool here take you to square two and show you the way. Come back when you're queen and we'll crack a pot of tea together. Now, be gone! Thank you, your majesty! * * At the bottom of this gorge is the entrance to square two, and that's the beginning of your journey to become a queen. I can't wait to get started. The first part of the trip is pretty easy. It gets harder the closer you get to square eight. I'll make it. Suppose you become a queen, do you know how to act like a queen? I hope so. You look and act like a little girl, but to be a queen you've got to look and act like nobility. I'll try very hard. Let me give you some pointers. * * From your lofty throne address the crowd * * Demand their loyalty * That makes me groan, I'd be more proud if I earned my loyalty * * With scepter high demand esteem, make them kneel to you * * I'd rather not try to act so mean, that's not how I feel, do you? * * * Nobility * That's what you've got to learn * * Nobility is something I must earn * * * Be sure that praise is all you take * * A queen must never be wrong * * And go for days without mistakes * * Oh, I should live so long * * Nobility * That's what you've got to learn * * Nobility is something I must earn * Now Alice, here's how you do it. * Be cold as ice * I'd rather be nice * Always disagree * But that's not me * Tax the people blind * That's so unkind * Be wise as a sage * I'll act my age * Be tough and hard bitten * * I'll be soft as a kitten * * Be shifty and sly * I won't even try * Yell and scream a bit * I wouldn't dream of it * There's nothing to it * I just couldn't do it * To wear a crown and rule the land takes more than civility * * When a person is down and you lend a hand, now that's nobility * * * Nobility * That's what you've got to learn * * Nobility is something I must earn * Oh. You don't think I can be a queen. If you make it, I'd like to be your court jester and magician. Really? Thank you, Tom. Now, let's get you to the second square. How do we get to the bottom of that deep gorge? We'll slide down on the rainbow. It's not raining. It will. I don't believe it. The sky is perfectly clear. Tumble, mumble, thunder rumble! Smash and crash, lightning flash. * (thunder crashing) Do you believe? I believe. Make it stop. Rain rain go away. Come again some other day. * I've said that lots of times, but the rain never goes away. There's our rainbow! * (laughing) * You make everything so easy, Tom. It won't all be so easy. I can't go with you after square two. I have to serve the White Queen. You said you wanted to serve me. You're not a queen yet. Well, when I get to square six I'll be almost a queen. Can't you join me there? I'll try. Let's go. Which way? The way the sign says. What does it say? I can't read it. It says "SECOND SQUARE." It's in reverse. Remember, you're on the other side of the looking glass and everything is opposite now. Oh yes, when I look in the mirror, my left hand is really the right hand on my image in the glass. So we have to go the opposite way the sign points. Oh, it's very bewildering. I don't know if I can make it without you. Sure you can. Queens can do anything. You're almost a queen, so you can do anything...almost. (laughing) * * Now you're at square two and you can start your journey. Oh! The country gets more beautiful all the time. Wait! You have six more squares to go. How do I get across all of 'em? A pawn goes two squares in the first move. I'll guide you across this one, then you'll go by train across the third square-- very fast. I love trains. Oh, what's that sound? It's like thousands of giant bees buzzing. That's right. It's a bee colony. It's on our way. C'mon! * (buzzing) * They're elephants. They're bees. * Adorable. * Oh! * They must be elephants. I've been told--I've seen. Don't believe everything you hear and only half of what you see. All right. Then I believe they're half-bee and half-elephant. Hmmm, that's a very wise and queen-like observation. Thank you. Now can we go on? * We'll get a ride now. * (neighing) * I've never seen such creatures. Can we ride 'em? Why not? (whistling) I need two volunteers. * (galloping) Thanks fella. Hey dude. How ya doin'? It's cool. Okay, hop on. You take this one. I'll take the unicorn. (whinnying) We'll make it to square three in no time. * Giddy up. Giddy up? Are you for real? I just said giddy up. Hey, do I look like a horse? Part of you does. Well, I'm, you know, like a centaur. Sorry. I forgot to believe only half of what I see. You're the front end of a man and a horse's rear end. That's gross. Look. Tom's getting way ahead. Can't we just go? Like where? To the third square. So why didn't you say that, like, up front? * What happened, Tom? That silly unicorn bucked me off. Couldn't you get back on? I got so mad I changed him into a rabbit and he ran away. Well, there's no way I'm gonna haul both of you. Off my back. Later. It was fun while it lasted. Relax. I'll use the old hocus pocus. (yelling) Wait'll you see this. It's a bird. It's a plane. It's Pegasus. * I should've called on old Peg to start with. Now we'll go first class, non-stop all the way to square three. C'mon. * This is great! Why don't we just fly all the way to the eighth square? None of these creatures ever leave square two. Ah, but you'll get other rides. * There's the gate to square three. * You're on your own. I wish you were coming along, Tom. You'll do fine. Better hurry. The train that takes you across square three will be waiting at the station. Bye. Hurry. All aboard! Wait for me! I'm coming. Please wait! * Oh, I just made it. Hello. I'm happy to be traveling with all of you. My name is Alice. That's your name, but what are you? I'm a girl. How odd, I'm a goat. Yes, I know. You do? Well, I suppose I'm well known. I'm the president of this railroad. That's very nice. I hope we meet again on the train coming back. Impossible. Our trains only go in one direction. That's weird. You'd make twice as much if you went both ways. (bleating) Both ways? What a revolutionary concept. Bold, daring, but quite intriguing. I'll have to think about that. Yes, yes, very provocative. * I don't believe I caught your name. It's C. Biscuit. Sea Biscuit? Why, you're a famous racehorse. I've heard a lot about you. No, no, my last name is Biscuit. My first initial is C for Charlie. Charlie Biscuit. I pull a milk wagon over in square four. Well, that's good honest work. I'm sure you're well rewarded. Yup, I get all the yogurt I want free. Wonderful. I hate yogurt. Um, and you sir, may I ask your name? Post Gazette. That sounds like a newspaper. I am the newspaper. Number one in circulation throughout the land. You read me? No. Well, I mean I can't read you because you're printed all backwards. How dare you. Backwards! Only to me. That's because I come from the other side of the looking glass. Well, I suppose there are two sides to everything. (train chuffing) * You're very rude, young lady. Are you speaking to me? Is there any other young lady present? No, but what did I do? First, you stared quite openly at my classified section. Oh, I'm sorry. And you were very brazen about studying my financial section. I didn't realize. And for the past five minutes you gawked with absolutely no shame at my comic section. I really am sorry, but I've never seen a newspaper man before. Incredible. Where do you get your daily paper? From a newspaper boy. Well, boys grow up to be men. Newspaper boys, newspaper men. If you've seen one you must've seen the other. You're really not very observant. Anyway, I apologize. Oh, this silly train is going right past my station. Quick, throw me out the window. * Thank you! (train whistling) * We're flying. This is a train. Why are we flying? We came to a hill. How else would we get to the other side? You could dig a tunnel through the hill. (bleating) You know, that's a very interesting idea, brilliant. I'll suggest it at the next board meeting. (train chuffing) * Hurry, close the window. We are coming to the river. * We're going under the river? Well certainly. It was in the way. Well why don't you build a bridge over the river? (bleating) Clever, ingenious! Would you consider becoming chairman of the board? Thank you, but I'm hoping to become a queen. Why don't you go for the top spot and become a king? Only a man can be a king. That's politics for you. I'd stay out of it if I were you. Is this the end of the square? (train whistling) Everybody out to push. You want us to push this train? Have to, Miss. We're goin' north. And north is always uphill you know. It'd be so much easier if we were goin' south. South is all downhill. But that's only on a map. Well, we're on a map. Please hurry, we'd like to stay on schedule. * All right. Put your shoulders to it. * Ah, it's so pleasant I'll think I'll just walk the rest of the way. Have a nice day. (bleating) Can't you think of some excuse to leave? I'm not very smart. That's why I pull a milk wagon. (train whistle) * * End of the line, Miss. We hope you enjoyed your trip and thanks for riding One Way Railway. Now can you tell me how far it is to square four? Just across that river. The ferry boat'll take you over. There's no water. You'll appreciate that if you fall overboard. Good day, Miss. Cast off! * (boat horn) * (coughing) * * Well, I'm in square four such as it is. But where do I go now? There's a sign post, that'll tell me! * That's a big help. Hop hop hop hop hop hop hop hop hop hop hop hop hop hop hop hop hop hop. You didn't jog so good today. I jogged fine till you hipped when you should've hopped. I never hip. You hip lots of times. How'd you like a big fat hip on the lip? Who's gonna give it to me? Gentlemen, please. My name is Alice. My name's Tweedledum. And I'm Tweedledee. * * We're Tweedledum * And Tweedledee * I look like him * He looks like me * We think alike * But disagree * We're Tweedledum * And Tweedledee * We're Tweedledum and Tweedledee * * Say, how come you always get top billing * * Sorry we're Tweedledee * And Tweedledum * A trialsome consortium * We argue some * No, you do chum * We're Tweedledee * And Tweedledum * Better known as Tweedledum and Tweedledee * * We just found out the other day we each have one twin brother * * So incredibly we are forced to say we're related to each other * -No. -Yes * 'Cause we're Tweedledum * And Tweedledee * I look alike * And so does he * An amazing similarity * We're Tweedledum * And Tweedledee * We're Tweedledum * Say, haven't we met before? * * Sure, we're Tweedledum and Tweedledee * * Oh yeah, we're Tweedledum and Tweedledee * Oh, I've heard a lot about you two. Never heard about you. I'm from the other side of the looking glass. You a giant? No, where I come from I'm just a small girl. (whistling) Then I'd hate to see a big one. I'm on my way to become a queen. Can you tell me how to get to the next square please? Just follow the signs, that's what they're there for. But they point in opposite directions. Those signs are for people like you from the other side of the looking glass. You have to go in the opposite direction from the way the sign points. -Which sign? -Either one. If you wanna go left you gotta go right. And if you wanna go right, you gotta go left, right? No, left. I said left. You said right. I'm gonna hang a right on you. Start hanging. Please, don't fight! I'll find my way just fine thank you. Hey, glad we could help. Are you athletes? Yep. Track stars. Run the mile, the marathon, cross-country. But we stay in shape by fighting. Who do you fight? Each other. Oh yes, I remember the old rhyme. Um, Tweedledum and Tweedledee agreed to have a battle for Tweedledum said Tweedledee had spoiled his nice new rattle. I never owned any silly rattle. The only thing that rattles around here is his head. I'm gonna rattle your head. Stop it! I'm sorry I mentioned that old rhyme. It's time to work out in the gym. Wanna watch us work out? Thank you. But I really should be going. I've gotta get to the eighth square before dark. We'll jog along with you and lead the way. I'd appreciate that. * There, you can see the door to square five. I can't see it. That's cause I'm taller than you. You're shorter. I'm taller. And I'm gonna cut you down to size. Please fellas, not again! We've gotta go back now. Thank you both for your help. Just keep going and you'll come to the door of the fifth square real soon. Start hopping. Hop hop hop hop hop hop hop hop hop hop hop. That's very strange. A door to nothing. Leading to nowhere. This must be the entrance to square five. So I suppose I should go through the door. (knocking) Come on in. Door's open. Hello whoever you are. * I'm Alice. Nice to meet ya, Alice. Come on in. Where are you? Right up here. Come in. Come in! Why, you're-- at least I think you're-- The name's Humpty Dumpty. That's spelled with an H and a D and two umpties. I thought that's who you were, but I always imagined you quite different. Well, now I think I'm kinda different. You don't run across a whole lotta eggs with arms and legs who can talk. Yes, but I thought you'd be wearing shirt and pants. Like an egg man, you know? (laughing) That's a pretty good one that is, a man-egg. People don't lay eggs. Are you a chicken egg? You wanna know what I am? Well, I'll tell you what I am. What I am is a dinosaur egg. And you just can't hardly get them no more. Oh wow! A dinosaur egg. You know how long it takes a dinosaur egg to hatch? Mercy. Many, many years. I got purely tired of waitin' to bust out of my shell so I started growin' on the outside. It didn't turn out real good. This is as far as I got. That's incredible. You don't believe it? I'll just jump down and show ya something. Don't jump. You'll break! You can't crack a tough old dinosaur egg that easy. See that? Now, you just forget what you read in some dumb fairy tale and you believe my tail. I believe. If you had hatched you might've been huge and scary. You know, that might've been kinda fun, but I try not to fret over what might have been. * * I dreamed I'd be 40 feet high * * Instead I'm this shrimp of a guy * * I'm not spooky and scary or yucky and hairy * * There must be a good reason why * * I planned to be some dinosaur * * Breathe fire, grumble and roar * * But it wasn't to be, I guess you can see * * I'm just a good egg and no more * * Oh, you just gotta be what you are * * Don't aim too high or too far * * You're better I found with both feet on the ground * * You just gotta be what you are * * You can strive, you can reach * * And then miss the gold ring * * But twelve centuries from now it just won't mean a thing * * La de-da da-da-da da la da-da * * Don't try to be something you're not * * You don't have to have a whole lot * * Don't sit around mopin' just wishin' and hopin' * * Make the best of whatever you've got * * Oh, you just gotta be what you are * * Don't aim too high or too far * * And if you don't make it then don't try to fake it * * You just gotta be what you are * Everybody! * You just gotta be what you are * * Don't aim too high or too far * * You're better I've found with both feet on the ground * * You just gotta be what you are * * You just gotta be what you are * (laughing) And that's what I guess you could sorta call my philosophy. It's just what I was telling Tom when he said I had to be nasty and mean to be a queen. I intend to be just what I am. Then you'll be a real good one, whatever you are. Something puzzles me, I thought you always sat up on that wall. I gotta tell ya, sittin' on a wall is not one of your biggest thrills in life. But it says in the nursery rhyme Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall. Well, now you just gotta take them old nursery rhymes with a dose of salt. Uh, you mean a grain of salt. That'll get it too. Oh, you uh plannin' to stick around a spell or you just passin' through? I'm going to the eighth square to become a queen. And I'd better be going. I'll walk you a ways. Get ya pointed in the right direction. * Wanna see somethin' kinda special? * Oh, it's just like all the big stone-faced statues on Easter Island. * I call it Easter Egg Island. I painted all of 'em, sort of a hobby. They're beautiful! Yes siree, all dinosaur eggs. Still waitin' to hatch. You painted this one so pretty. I hope it's a girl. And I hope you didn't jinx it. I sort of figured on a boy. That's funny. My father said almost that very same thing to me just this morning. Best tell your dad not to go foolin' around with dinosaur eggs. Oh, he doesn't. You see, he was only talking about... Fella's got to know what he's doin' when he messes around with a dinosaur. He's a doctor. You mean he treats sick dinosaurs? I never even knew one to have the sniffles. He's not that kind of a-- Your dad oughta take up another line of work. There's just not a whole heck of a lot of sick dinosaurs. Oh, I'll tell him. I love your Ester Egg Island, but I really have to be getting along. Well, I'm sorry to see you go, but square six is just the other side of this island, right after you cross the hanging bridge. Thanks for showing me the way. And I enjoyed meeting you very much. Pleasure was all mine. You made my day. Now I gotta go back and sit on that dumb old wall some more. Good luck, little lady. * Ooh, the trip really does get harder. I hope Tom can join me again soon. * * Oh! * Tom, where are you? Please, I need you! Oh, stop! * Please stop! All right, you rascals. A plague on all malicious midgets. * (clanking) One of the glorious white knights at your service, fair maiden. We perform rescues and deeds of derring-do at all hours. We are as close as your nearest scream for help. Oh, thank you sir. You arrived just in time. It's a place swarming with evil creatures of all sorts. You really shouldn't enter it. I do wish you wouldn't. But I have to get to square eight. I'm gonna become a queen. Ahhh, a queen! That changes the picture, of course. (laughing) I should be privileged to accompany you across this domain of demons, and defend you every step of the way, milady. Would you like that? Oh, yes! I'll feel much safer. Hmmm, may I have your lace handkerchief to carry next to my heart? It's a quaint little chivalrous custom we knights have. Would you humor me? I'd be ever so grateful. I'm sorry, I don't own a lace hanky. But I've got Kleenex. Eh, I think not. It simply isn't the same. However, I shall still fight for you just as nobly. May we go now? Um, should I ride in front or behind you? I'm afraid Giselle isn't quite up to carrying two riders, dear thing. I hate to ask you to walk. Oh not me, I couldn't walk three feet in this armor. Heavy metal. And these solerets, dear girl, they just kill me to stand on them. That's terrible. Hmm, they're a size too small and I have a very high instep. You do see, don't you? Yes, I didn't realize. I'll walk. Of course. I shall lead the way. * Oh! Sir knight! Sir knight! * Oh heavens! I simply can't stand flying things with fangs and talons. Go away you horrid creatures! * Well, they're gone. And don't you come back you beastly frights! Or you'll feel a slash of the White Knight's sword again. Well, let's get out of here. Well, I'm dreadfully sorry, but I must ride back to the castle at once and secure a new helmet. Do you have to have a helmet? Oh dear, yes. I sunburn so easily. But I'll be alone in this terrible land. There are other white knights about. You may be fortunate and run across one. I do hope you're fortunate. I do. I really do. I'm listing badly. Would you be ever so kind and hand me my sword please? Thank you so much. I needed that for balance. Farewell, fair maiden. May the good spirits protect you in my absence. Godspeed. I really oughta go along to protect him. * (growling) Oh! * (rumbling of boulders) * Ow! * Tom? I'm so glad you came back. You'll be all right now. C'mon. * There. When we go through that tunnel, we'll be in square seven. I'm almost a queen! That's Jabberwock territory. You ready for that? Of course. I've come this far. I'm going all the way. Let's do it! * The Jabberwock is everywhere. And he's got some evil henchmen. Oh, let's just hope he doesn't know we're coming through. I'll stop her. I'm the Jabberwock, and I'm mean. (roaring) Don't roar at me you big oaf. Roar at the girl! I want her stopped immediately. She mustn't reach square eight. Do you hear? You got it. Me and the Bandersnatch here can take anybody, your majesty. (breathes fire) I'll gobble her up in one bite. Hey, we're all partners. You oughta split three ways. Snarks get nuthin'. You don't even scare anybody. You always put me down just because I'm small. Well, I don't care how you do it. Just stop her! She's gone too far. She's had it. I hope so. Or you've all had it. Hey, we got an assignment here. One little girl... Piece a cake! I can do my spine-tingling howl. You do nuthin'. You a Snark. People laugh when you try to act mean. You're a joke. No howlin'. Just a suggestion. * * We work for that crazy Red Queen * * We're the lowest and meanest of mean * * We're bad Me too! me too! * We'll tear all our foes apart * * Our evil is state of the art * * We're bad And don't forget me! * I'm Bandersnatch with breath of flame * * I burned up towns to gain my fame * * I'm Jabberwock, my game's the same * * We're bad * We'll plot and we'll plan and conspire to set the whole country on fire * * We're bad And so is the Snark. * And then when it's lying in ruin * * More mischief we soon will be brewin' * * We're bad No more than me. * As Jabberwock I do my worst to show we're first among the curse * * In rottenness we are immersed * * We're bad I know! * Untrustworthy, scheming and tricky * * We're totally slimy and icky * * As opposed to this wimp who simply is absurd * Huh? * What a nerd! Hey, I resent that! (laughing) * * With hostility we must remark * * We're terrifying lords of dark * * We'll zap you out just for a lark * * We're bad * The Jabberwock * The Bandersnatch Hey, and don't forget the Snark! -Who? -Me! * We're bad Now what's our plan? The Red Queen says this girl is smart. We're smarter. She's gotta go past that swamp full of man-eatin' crocodile. (laughing) So? So, we'll lay a trap that'll lead her right into that swamp. C'mon. * We're over halfway there. And no sign of the Jabberwock. Keep your eyes open. * (growling) * That'll keep her from going around that side. Now, we'll plug up the other side. The crocodiles are going to get all the goodies. You can have what's left. Sheesh, I always get seconds. (laughing) There, she can't go on either side. She's gotta go straight into the swamp now. We'll just sit and wait for the fun to begin. * * Look! It's a forest fire. No, it's the Bandersnatch. And that means the Jabberwock is probably close by too! Can we sneak around 'em? Stay here. I'll go ahead and see. What's keeping her? We'll get action. They set a trap to lead us into a swamp full of crocodiles. Can we get around it? Ah, both sides blocked off solid with big trees. Time for magic. Yep, buckle up for another short hop. * I just heard something fly over. What was it? I don't know. Well, what did it sound like? (bang) It sounded like that. We made it! We're safe! And look at that. Is it the castle of the Red Queen? Yep. When we cross that drawbridge we're in square eight. And the Red Queen has to crown you. We beat her! We won! Ooh, that horrid child got past the Jabberwock. Quick, raise the drawbridge and don't let her in. * We can't make it! * * Now, we can dine in pleasure. The drawbridge is raised and the girl is locked out. She'll never be a queen. (laughing) * No, it can't be! I won't have it. You must crown me Queen Alice, your highness. Never! Rules of the game, madam. You're a wizard, do something. Stall for time. Make her a queen and I'll think of some way to get rid of her. Much as it revolts me, I hereby pronounce you-- (noise of disgust) Queen Alice. * Oh, I'm a queen at last. * And I have promised to serve you, milady. * Start working your horrible spells and sorcery. Frighten her. Make her throw away that crown and be gone. * (flame crackling) Oh! * Ah! * Where did the Red Queen go? Call the castle guards and get me off this ridiculous platter. Guards! * Guards! Don't just stand there! Take these two and lock them up in the tower keep. Say goodbye. After her! The drawbridge is up. We can't get out that way. Use your magic staff and float us down. * (sword fighting) * * I don't know if this'll work. * Oh, that wasn't very magic. Well, that was the last of my power. And I lost my crown. Never mind, to me, you're still a queen. Thank you, Tom. That's really sweet. (growling) (breathes fire) Guards! There they are, take them! Trouble ahead. And trouble behind. Use your magic. I told you, it's shot. Well then I've gotta get back to the mirror and into my own room. You tricked us once but not this time. (roaring) * C'mon, we gotta go across. Look! Just follow me. * (roaring) (splashing) * (roaring) * Hello there. Bye now. They must've opened a new pizza parlor some place. Hop hop hop hop hop hop. (screeching) It's a marathon. Nobody told us. * Stop! We don't go in that direction. * * Queen Alice, come join me for tea. You're not invited. You work for the Red Queen, you horrible beasts. Now, take a hike. (roaring) (breathes fire) This pot of tea is cold. Warm it up for me, hot breath. (laughing) * There's the mirror. Better hurry, they're not far behind. Aren't you coming with me? I've got to stay here and serve the White Queen now that you're leaving. But those beasts. And you lost your magic staff. Don't worry, I'll get another one. Go! I'll always remember you, Tom. And I'll never forget you, Queen Alice. * I can't get back through the mirror. * I don't understand. I walked right through to this side so easy. That's it. Everything is opposite here, remember? You walked in forward, so you've gotta back out. Goodbye, Tom. Goodbye, Alice. (kissing) * (laughing) Oh, Tom. * Ah! The Jabberwock, the Jabberwock! The jabberwho? Oh, oh Daddy. I'm so glad it's you. I just got home. Were you having a bad dream? No, it was fantastic. I was a queen. You will always be a queen. (laughing) That's sort of what Tom said. Do I know this Tom? No. And Humpty Dumpty said-- I know that fellow. Well, he said you shouldn't fool around with dinosaurs or try to treat 'em if they're sick. (laughing) Honey, if a dinosaur ever calls on me, I'll need a doctor. Now sit down and tell me about this fantastic dream you had. Well, it all started out when I went through the looking glass. I wonder... was it really a dream? * *
