(light perky music) (stick thudding) (Ken gasps) (bottle popping) (bird squawks) (Ken groaning) (popcorn crunching) (sausage chewing) (upbeat music) - Honey, you need to help me out. There's so much junk left from the previous owners. - I'm busy. - I'm still not sure it was a good idea moving to this house. I've heard some stories. - What kind of stories? - They say the last owner got possessed by an evil spirit and turn into a zombie. - Come on, that's just an urban legend. It's like Big Foot or straight fashion designers. - Oh, I don't know. - There's nothing to be worried about. - If you say so. (eerie music) What's this? - You found something? - Yeah, it's an old book. (speaking foreign language) What does that mean? - Who can say. - It seems to be filled with some kind of spells and rituals or something. - I wonder what happens if you read them. - I don't think it's a good idea. - Ugh, don't be such a bag of dicks. (speaking foreign language) (baby crying) (dog barking) Told you so. Bullshit. (suspenseful music) (demon speaking in foreign language) (ominous music) - The storage hasn't been used for over a year. The owners died and their relatives haven't showed up to claim their belongings. Some things with address notes are to be sent away. The rest you can throw in the trash. - Is this the same basement where all those murders took place? - What murders? - You know, like three years ago this mad scientist went on a rampage killing all those people, cutting off their body parts for his wife's severed head. - I don't know what you're talking about. Now clean this up. I'll be in my office. - Fucking shitty job man. (ominous music) (heart beating) (zombie groaning) What the fuck. (bones cracking) (ominous music) (man screaming) (birds chirping) (slow paced music) - Oh Ruth! My dear sister. Why did you have to depart! I miss you so much! If ever there was a way to bring you back. (doorbell ringing) (bottle thudding) Oh dear! (light music) (doorbell ringing) (bottle shattering) (ominous music) Hello? (monster growling) What in Lords name is this? (ominous music) Well, it has my name on it. - Hello! (Catherine screaming) Calm down, calm down! - What are you? - I'm Barboura! - But you're a head! - I am fully aware of my situation. And yours? - Mine? - We're both missing something. I'm missing a body, and you're missing a sister, right? - Yes. (solemn music) My sister Ruth. I do miss her. She's dead you see. - I know. But she doesn't have to be, with help from my late husband, the brilliant Dr. Morris. We can bring her back to life you see. - My dear Ruth? (ominous music) Alive? - But there is a price. - Oh? - Yes! I want a body! And you must help me! - But how! - I will show you. (Dr. Morris clears throat) - Hello! - It's a video! - I see. - If you're watching this, it probably means that I'm dead. But do not grieve my dear. During my afterlife experiments I found a secret to life after death. (Dr. Morris laughing) There is this voodoo flower seed from Iceland, which has the special power to recombine human DNA cells and restore them to their original form. All you have to do is find the undisturbed place in the forest. And plant the seeds together with ashes from the deceased. Make sure it gets water, lots of water. And after only one night, it shall grow. (Catherine gasps) - You're doomed! (Catherine gasping) (phone ringing) Hello. Oh, good afternoon to you sir. - Give it up Callahan! Surrender and I won't shoot you in the nuts! - Never! (gun firing) - Hello, I'm Robert Cornthwaite reporting live from a shootout between Detective Margaret Sheridan and infamous criminal Doyle Callahan. Police, hostage, guns, crime, people, trees, cars, the mood is intense and so am I. - Okay, I called for backup. They're on their way. - Backup? Aw, screw that! I'm taking down Callahan myself! - I think we should wait. - Wait? I say we shoot the fucker! - But you can hit the hostage! - That's a risk I'm willing to take. - I'll kill the hostage! I'll shoot him in the head! - Go ahead, you're bluffing. - No! Don't do anything stupid Callahan! Okay, wait here. - Wait? What? All right. (guns firing) - Oh, will the terror never end? - Look everyone! It's Zebraman! - Ah ha! - Ugh, Zebra Man. - Let go of the hostage Callahan! (crowd cheering) - Ha! You think you can stop me Zebraman? Your stripes don't threaten me. (hip music) (gun firing) - My hero! How can I ever thank you? - Just by being happy. (sirens blaring) - I'll take it from here. You're under arrest dirt bag! You have the right to shut the fuck up! - Well, that means my work here is done. (crowd cheering) - [Crowd] Zebraman, we love you! - I love you too! (crowd cheering) - Get your black and white horse ass out of here! - What's going on here? - Where have you been? You ruined everything. Zebraman just caught Callahan. - But, that's a good thing. Isn't it? - You don't get it. You just don't get it! (tense music) - Hello, I'm Robert Cornthwaite reporting live from a toilet where I'm taking a shit. Earlier today, infamous criminal Doyle Callahan was captured by mysterious superhero Zebraman. There was gunfire and hostage, but yet again, Zebraman saved the day. The town has never been safer. We talked to an 80s haircut about the situation. - [80s haircut] I love Zebraman, he's amazing! (rock music) - Any comments? - No! Shut up! (people chatting) (phones ringing) - I heard about Callahan. - So close! Do you know what's gonna happen to him? - They're giving him the chair. - Here you go. - Thanks. - Oh fuck. Sorry I'm late boss. (Chief grunting) - We were just discussing Zebraman. - Ugh, that dork. - Well, thanks to him, crime rates have gone down, down, down, 95%. - Amateur. (Chief grunting) Well yeah, you're right Chief. With no crime on the streets there is nothing for us to do! We need a really hard crime that not even Zebraman can handle. We need a super crime. - But isn't not having a super crime a good thing? (Chief grunting) (ominous music) - [Demon] Ken. Ken. - [Rob] I wonder what happens if you read it. - I don't know. There's nothing to be worried about. And that owner can possess that evil spirit. - [Rob] Don't be such a bag of dicks. - [Ken] Turn into a zombie! - [Rob] That's just an urban legend. It's like Big Foot just... (Ken breathing heavy) - Rob, I had such a nightmare! - Just write about it in your journal. (Ken sobbing) - [Demon] Ken. Kill. (water running) - So, what do we do now? - Now, we wait. What time is it? - 10:58! - Oh, so still early. (ground rumbling) Oh! It's happening! - Oh my God! - God is not present! - I'm back! - Ruth, is that you? - Yes my dear sister, it's me. - Ruth! I missed you! - Yes. But we're not finished! Now, we have to find a body! - But, that means, murder? - I can't stay like this. How am I supposed to go shopping for shoes, or even wear them? I'm a housewife for Pete's sake. - Oh, but, murder? I don't even jaywalk! - Think about it! You and Ruth together again, baking cookies. - Well, there is this new recipe that I've been dying to try. And you've always been much better at frosting than me. - I know. - Okay! But we need to find someone really immoral and disgraceful. Like someone who doesn't vote or recycle. - Yes, yes. We'll find someone! (Ruth Plant laughing) - Yes! - [Barboura] Hurry up and find someone! (head laughing) (ominous music) (Judy screams) - Why you scared me! - You're doomed. - Excuse me? - Doomed I say. - You want some money? - Doomed! Bless your soul! But you're still doomed! (ominous music) (doorbell ringing) - Oh, that's nice. (ominous music) (heart beating) (Judy screaming) - Hey there, do you mind if I fertilize? - Oh, my! - Ooh! - [Judy] What's happening? - Oh yeah! - What is this? - Stop! - You've been a naughty - [Ruth Plant] Naughty girl, haven't you? - Don't stop! (slow paced music) - Oh you filthy, filthy little girl. - Oh, don't stop! - [Ruth Plant] Ooh! (Judy moaning) Oh my! Oh! I need to punish you all day long! Oh my! (Judy sighs) - Call me! (Judy gasps) Oh, just a dream. (eerie music) - Good morning honey. (light upbeat music) - Is there coffee? - Of course sweetie. You look so nice today. Your eyes are so pretty, I could eat them. - Okay, weird. - I made breakfast. - I'm not hungry. - But I fried eggs and ovaries, your favorite! - Don't you mean fried eggs over easy? - Oh, that makes more sense. - I'm late for work anyway. - Honey, why don't you take the morning off? We could cuddle and watch pictures of fluffy animals. - Damn it! (clippers buzzing) I have a job to do and it's important! - More important than me? - I have to go. - What about a morning kiss? - There's no time. (Ken sobbing) (slow paced music) - [Zombie] Kill. Kill. Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill! - Hello, I'm Robert Cornthwaite, (man in mask grunting) reporting live from a bed where a couple is having intercourse. Last night a young woman was attacked by an unknown stranger in her home. - It's hard to describe. It had a face, but it was kind of a plant. - Plant? (camera shuttering) - Find something? - I'm not sure, but I think this could be a clue. - There are no clues here. I think we're dealing with a super crime. - This is a sketch of the suspect. - Got you now jerk face! Fax this to headquarters! We need to put this on lamp posts all over town! I'm bringing this fucker down! But, what, what happened to Reeves? (triumphant music) - What's going on here? - Zebraman! - I see a crime has been committed. - Yes, but there are no clues. - Exactly, so we don't need you here. - Oh? What's this? - Slime? Big whoop. - This isn't just slime, this is DNA. Alien DNA. - My God, this is such a breakthrough! - Is it? Is it really? - Yes. - Hello, I'm standing here with an ordinary woman, Judy Geeson, who was attacked by a mysterious stranger in her home last night. Tell us about this terrifying experience! (Judy vomiting) (siren blaring) - Well, the results are back and yes, I do have mental illness in my family. - What about my sickness? - Right, you're pregnant. - Pregnant? That's not possible. - That's what they said before they invented the doorknobs. - I mean, how can I be pregnant without sexual intercourse? - Diet? Eat a lot of fiber? - That doesn't make any sense! - In the world, what do make sense? - A lot of things. - Touché! - Are you even a real doctor? - Define real? - Not fake. - Define doctor. - Someone with a medical degree. - Then no. But I will prescribe you this recipe. - Is it some kind of medicine? - No, it's my very own apple pie recipe. I make it everyday. - Do you work here as a chef? (blonde laughing) - I don't work here at all! (doorbell ringing) (slow sexy music) - Well hello. - I'm the handyman. - You do look handy, that's for sure. - Well, someone called about some pipes that need to be plugged. - Yeah, I have a pipe that needs to be taken care of. Can you handle it? - Oh, I can handle anything with my tool. - I'm sure. - Just show me where to plunge it. Mm-hm. Looks like your pipe needs to be taken care of. - Yeah, it's been a while. Can you fix it somehow? - Sure. Nothing wrong with it. - Ooh. - It's big, (Rob moaning) hard, and steady. I just need to jack it a little bit. Oh no, I got all wet! (Rob moaning) - Wow, is that a wrench in your pants or are you just happy to see me? - Actually, it's a wrench. - Too bad. Do you like parties? - Yeah, why? - There's one in my pants. - Am I invited? - You're definitely on the guest list. VIP. - Sounds good. (both men moaning) Yeah, who's your Daddy? Who's your Daddy? - My Daddy? His name was Lord Arthur Cornthwaite. (ominous music) (men moaning) - Honey, I'm home! (solemn music) (Rob grunting) - Oh yeah.

The husband of one of the victims is missing and the door was unlocked. - What do the victims have in common? - Gay. - Ahh, gay victims. - Do you think we have a serial killer on our hands? - I think we might have a serial killer on our hands. - I tested the DNA samples... I tested the DNA samples we found at the crime scene, and it seems to be it's not one of the victims. - Then it must belong to the killer! - Well, what did the tests say? - Well, if my results are accurate, the killer is gay. - Gay? A gay killing gay? - It's not just gay DNA, it's zombie DNA. - Oh my God! Gay zombies? We have to do something! The whole town is in danger! - I think this could be a case for Zebraman. - No, no.

I'm doing laundry tonight. - [Ruth] I'm not a slave, I'm a housewife. - Oh, you're that creepy phone caller with blood stains right? - [Ruth] And you're the phone operator with very bad behavior. - Ugh, whatever. - [Ruth] You can't mix colors with whites. - How did you know that? (man gasps) Oh, it's just a bathroom. Oh. It's just a badminton game. Listen, I don't have time for this. What do you want? - [Ruth] I want your blood all over me. - Well okay, that's just gross and inappropriate. You need therapy. - [Ruth] And you need to be punished! (man gasps) - I just went to the hair dresser! I got a new manicure! (man sobbing) No! (Ruth laughing) - The police station! They should be able to help us! - Yeah! That's probably pretty accurate. (phone ringing) - All right, got your gun? - Yes. - Got your badge? - Yup. - Got your toothbrush? - You gotta help us! A gay zombie killed our friend. - A gay zombie? - Where was the last place you saw it? - He chased me to a party, but then I got away. - What kind of party? - Yeah, was it like a theme? Was there a dress code? What kind of music? - Oh stop it. - It's a gay party! - With gay people. - Doing gay things. - Sounds kinda gay. - Do you realize what this means? - No. - They're all in danger! We gotta hurry. - But not unarmed. Table! (ominous music) - Cool! - Should we really be giving guns to teenagers? - Yeah. - [Sheridan] Here you go kids. (upbeat music) (Kelly humming) (zombie coughing) (Kelly grunting) (Kelly screaming) (rock music) (zombie growling) (knife slicing) (slow paced music) (rock music) - I have a body! Oh. I feel so nice with my new body! - Yes, it fits perfectly. You're gorgeous. Now, where's Ruth? I need to find her. (machine beeping) - There's a tracking device following her every move. Here, you can see her location. - Ruth? Ruth, there you are. Wait, I shall come and find you! (ominous music) - Follow me, this way! Ow. (ominous music) (flies buzzing) - Kelly! - Kids. - It's a massacre! - Oh, they're corpses. Oh well that sucks. - This is terrible! - Boo hoo, bring me a violin! - We need to do something. Could you give me a hand here? - Oh sure. I think we got off on the wrong foot. - Kelly! (Donna screaming) Kelly! - Thank God it's only a dream. - No, it's not. - Or is it? - No! - Calm down woman! - She's dead! What am I gonna do! - I'll tell you what we're gonna do! We're gonna nail this gay motherfucking zombie! - I don't know if I can! I can't live without her! - Sure you can. Blonde chicks like that grow on trees! You need a real woman. (quirky music) (women moaning) - Are we gonna have an orgy? - No! Sheridan, focus! - Right. Let's kick some gay zombie ass. - But how are we gonna find it? - I say we use bait. - [Dylan And Donna] Yeah! - Oh! Shouldn't we call for backup? - All right you sissy, call the Chief. No fucking Zebraman! (Chief grunting) - Connect me to the President's office please. - Yes. One moment. Miss President. (upbeat music) - More champagne! (everyone cheering) - Miss President. Miss President. - Yeah, what? - It's the Chief of police on the phone. - Tell him I'm busy, with administration. - Ma'am. It's about a UFB. (record scratching) - Dear Lord! - UFB, what is that? - Unfucking Believable. Talk to me. (Chief grunting) What? (ominous music) A gay zombie? - A gay zombie? - A stray combie? - Okay, thank you Chief. Kep me posted. If this zombie virus is spreading, it could wipe out the entire population! - What do we do Miss President? - There's only one thing we can do. Send out the Viking. (everyone gasps) - Miss President, what about the consequences? I think this is a mistake. - The President doesn't make mistakes. - This is such a big decision you guys. This goes straight to the history books. Take a snapshot. - Oh Bellula, this is too much for me to handle right now. I was just getting my groove on. - I love you Miss President, but you only get 14 hours to save the Earth. - You're right. This is my responsibility. And my destiny. - Miss President. - Make the call. - Yeah. Let's have gay sex here in the parking lot. - Perfect bait. Now we just wait for our gay zombie to appear. - Get down on your knees. - What? - It's more believable. - Okay. I'm gonna put your gay cock in my gay mouth now! - Do it. - What? No. - Come on, just the tip. - Stop it! Mm, gay cock. (zipper zipping) - [Dylan] Suck it, suck it. Suck it. - What the hell man! - Come on, it's almost in. Just a little nibble. - We're on a mission here. - Guys, someone's coming. Don't make any sudden moves! I mean you can move, just not sudden. (ominous music) - Watch out! (zombie growling) - Smile you son of a bitch! (Ruth screaming) - Good girls don't play with guns! They must be punished! - You're alive! - Too bad you will die! (ominous music) - What do I do? - Shoot the zombie! (gun firing) - Dylan! (solemn music) No! (zombie growling) Milking it? (Ruth screaming) - Gay! - If only Zebraman was here! - [Zebraman] Did someone say Zebraman? - [Sheridan] Hooray! (triumphant music) (Ruth grunting) (zombie growling) - You're bleeding! - I ain't got time to bleed. Come on Zebraman, get him! - Yeah! - I can't! He's too strong! His gay powers are expanding! - That's what he said. (tense music) They released the Viking. - I'm here to chew bubblegum and kick ass. And I'm all out of bubblegum. (Viking growling) - [Both Men] Yeah! (light gentle music) - Ruth! - Catherine? - Ruth, my dear sister. This madness has to stop! - But all this, all this bad behavior, it must be punished! - No. You are not the sister I once knew. You are not my dear Ruth! - Punish! - I'm sorry. - Shoot that bitch! - Hey guys! - [Dylan] I'm still alive! (gun firing) Awe man. (Catherine gasping) - Here, you do it. - No, let's do it together. (gun firing) (Ruth gasping) (Sheridan grunting) - Oh Ruth! Ruth. This is difficult for me to say, how much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck would chuck wood. My dear sister, speak to me one last time. Let me hear your last words! (Ruth growling) I will never forget you, never forget you! Speak to me your last words so I will always and forever remember your beautiful soul! Whisper in my ears your last words. Your last words! Whisper in my ear. (Ruth grunting) Oh. (Catherine clears throat) (rock music) - You're under arrest asshole. - Well done detective Sheridan. - Where the hell have you been? And where's Zebraman? - It's me. (dramatic music) (Sheridan gasps) - It was you all along! - Yes it's true. I am Zebraman. - You're not a cop! (tense music) You're a hero! (Catherine clapping) (Donna cheering) - Whatever happened to all those zombies? (zombie hissing) (ominous music) - Mm, taking a bath! (light music) It's gonna be so nice! (doorbell ringing) I have visitors? At this hour? Who on earth could that be? (doorbell ringing) (door creaking) (Barboura screaming) (zombies growling) (violin music) (Barboura crying) No! (upbeat music) (people chattering) - Thank you. No comments. No comments. - Doomed I say. Doomed. - Get the fuck off! (slow paced music) - Miss President! - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! - Girl, girl! You've served our country well, and we're all grateful. That is why we salute you with this medal of honor. Unfortunately we only have one because our budget's tight. - Well, I think that belongs to Detective Sheridan. - I think we should share it. - Oh. You know what, you can have it. This is just uncomfortable. - Oh, well I'm glad that's over! Let's party! (crowd cheering) - And tomorrow is a new day. - And a new beginning. (birds chirping) (slow dramatic music) (rock music) - [Zombie] Kill. Kill. Kill.
