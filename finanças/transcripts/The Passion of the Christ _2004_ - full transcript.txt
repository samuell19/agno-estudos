That was the agreement between me... and you? Yes. Where? Where is he? Hear me, Father. Rise up, defend me. Save me from the traps they set for me. Do you really believe... ...that one man can bear... ...the full burden of sin? Shelter me, O Lord. I trust in You. In You I take refuge. No one man can carry this burden... ...I tell you. It is far too heavy. Saving their souls is too costly. No one. Ever. No. Never. Father, you can do all things. If it is possible, let this chalice pass from me... But let Your will be done... ...not mine. Who is your father? Who are you? Who are you looking for? We're looking for Jesus of Nazareth. I am he. Hail, Rabbi! Judas... ...you betray the Son of Man with a kiss? Peter! Put it down! Those who live by the sword shall die by the sword. Put it down. Malchus! Get up! We've got him. Let's go! What, Mary?

To the courtyard of the High Priest. Qui
