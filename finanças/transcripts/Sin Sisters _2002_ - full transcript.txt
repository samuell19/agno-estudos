This is beautiful house. I would never had know there was a pig or dog farm outside. Really? I think it's like, in the middle of nowhere. I would like to use this house for my next advertising shoot. Do you only use friends houses for locations? Last time it was my place. That's because your house like a place. I was so jealous everyday you did nothing but wear beautiful clothes. Don't be jealous it was boring. I wanted to work but my parents wouldn't allow it. Yeah, but Jum has a good business using no workers... ...just a few pigs and dogs. Jum said that the staff went home and they'll be back on Monday. That means this weekend there'll be only us, ...and our mobile phones don't even work. That fits the plot for a movie murder scene. You read my mind. I just tried to call home but my mobile doesn't work either. I've got to use the house phone. In such a lonely atmosphere, We might have a sleepless night. Let's find Jum and get something to eat. If we get drunk I have something much better wine to offer you. Don't tell me you've got us a porno movie. Are you nuts? Actually it's this stuff here you go. That's why you've been so happy all day. I haven't smoked any pot for ten years. Yeah, I almost forgot how it tastes. It's the "Miss-Goy-Brand", the "herbal specialist"... ...personally guarantees the quality. Here, have some, Jum! No thanks, better not. I am afraid of getting stoned. The smoke from you is already more than enough. It' won't kill, Jum. It's just like a cigarette. Come on, try a bit. Looks like we've forced a nun to sin. Don't rush it. Slowly, gently. Let's talk about the good old times before we get too wasted? What shall we talk about? There are so many things, I don't know where to start. Politics! What do you think about the present government? That's way too serious. What about something more fun, like erotic experiences. Are you crazy? Your mood changes quickly. A moment ago you were sad, now you're the naughty nurse. Why do you think it's so bad. There is nothing wrong with sex. I'm asking all four of you, are you still virgins? You've all had sex it's natural. Why do you pretend to be shy? It's so embarrassing. Do you think it's good to talk about it? I don't know how to start, it's such a long story. Oh god, a sudden storm, it's terrifying. Jum, do you have any candles? Light them or some ghosts might come, Jum. Quickly! It's fucking dark. It's OK, it's always like here. Even if a cat fart's there's a power cut, ...just like a totally underdeveloped country. Let's find a way to go some light into this place. - I'm scared. - Don't be afraid. Jum, Maem, Ann quickly. Calm down Goy. But, I'm afraid. This atmosphere is really intimidating. When will the danger be over? Or Meaw wants to take us with her? Don't talk like that. I'm so scared. Maem! Think we should talk about something a bit lighter. Smoking pot in this kind of atmosphere will just send you nuts. It's my own fault for smoking ganja, I'm a sinner... ...I'm being punished by the gods. I think we should find something that's fun to do. Like talking about our most embarrassing sexual experiences. What do you think? Not a bad idea. Then it won't be so quiet. I don't know what to say, especially in this kind of situation. OK! But when I'm finished don't you say I've been exaggerating. Right then, who's first? All right, I'll start. It is a story that I will never forget because... ...it was an will thing that happened to me. It was the most sinful sex of my life. I love you so much, Ann! I know, I love you too. Please, not so hard, slow down, it hurts, I'm bruised. I can't hold it back anymore. No, my love. Don't. It's only three weeks until our wedding. I'll wait for the day. Don't be sad. You do understand me, don't you? I understand but my leg's gone stiff. Think about something else. It's time for my shift, I'll call you. I've gotta go to the ward now. Be careful tonight I might come to your room while you're asleep. I'm not afraid that you'll come, I'm afraid that you won't. Bye bye. Take a seat. Hello, Miss Sawika. Is there anything you would like me to do, sir? I called you here as you are the Deputy-Head of Ward 5. We have a V.I.P. patient in your ward that I would like you... ...to give special care and attention to. Who is that patient, sir? I cannot disclose this right now, ...as the patient's family has asked for discretion. But if you take good care of him, it will be for your own benefit. Yes, sir. I will do the best I can, sir. Can I leave this with you, Miss Sawika? Yes, goodbye. May Buddha bless you, my dear. Do you suffer from any allergies to certain medicines? Not to medicines but love causes me pain. Do you have any chronic diseases or ailments? No diseases, but I've experienced a repeatedly broken heart. Where is this scar from? It's an old one. I got it a long time ago. So let's give you a complete check up. I'm always ready and prepared to prove my masculinity to you, ...here in Bangkapi. My sweetheart, have mercy on me. Ketsinee, Sawika, don't fool around and forget to check... ...the patient's temperature in room 502... ...at 1:00 am. You forgot to last time, didn't you? Yes, ma'am. You can call me Kate, Ju. Shit! You're frivolous, aren't you? Acting all innocent in front of me. Don't forget to take care of the V.I.P. patient... ...which the director ordered, In fact you'd better stay there continuously. I'll go in a minute. But, it's been less than half an hour since I left. Do you know any details about the patient, Ju? Not really, I only know that his parents have done favours for... ...the hospital. Ann, take care of him well. Didn't the director tell you... ...to take personal care of him? I guess he must be the director's creditor. Shit! I've gotta leave so I can do a detailed calculation to find out... ...how much the director owes this patient. What are you doing? I like it, don't stop. Do you mean you lost your virginity to a retard? That's OK as long as he was handsome. How many times did you do it? What happened next? What could I do? I had to keep going but that's not the end of it. We're here, grandfather. Is this where Lek has been admitted to? Do you think it's as good as Boston Hospital, Chai? - Slowly, father. - Be careful. I just found out that you have moved Lek to the hospital where Ann works. You cannot tell Ann about this. It's a family secret. I don't want anyone to know that the youngest son of... ...the Naruebalboripok family is retard. That's why we sent him to America for twenty years. Good evening, your honour, Mr. Damgerng, Mr. Chawee and Mrs. Nai. I see you've all arrived together. Which room, doctor? I really want to see my grandson. Please, walk slowly, father. It's here on the left, sir. Hello all, very funny. This sister is a very good horse rider. I can imagine the expression on your face. You shouldn't laugh, it isn't funny, it's distressing! After that I was forced to resign... ...and I haven't seen my boyfriend since. Don't worry, I would've done the same, Everyone makes mistakes. Your situation was nothing compared to mine, Ann. Mine was much more embarrassing. What! There's something worse than that? Definitely! My case, also happened many years ago. Quickly, Pong, I can't take it anymore. Just a second, darling! Why is it so difficult to get it in? Shit! Why is someone calling now. We're just getting to the hot stuff. Hello, what is it, my dear? Sorry, inspector, how can I help? Sir, yes, sir! I'm free, sir. I'll be there in fifteen minutes, sir. Goodbye, sir. Sorry, Joy. I must rush. There's just been a deadly shoot out. And I have to get there before the inspector arrives. Pong, are you gonna leave me in this state? I really want to do it too, Joy. My dick is going crazy. But what can I do, darling? Work must come first. It's always the same, Pong. Work, work, work. I'm so sorry, Joy. Don't be angry. Just wait until I've finished. Then we can carry on until the house collapses. But now I really must go. Don't be late, Pong, I'll be waiting. Drive safely. OK. I'll be back soon. Fuck it, I'll make myself climax. No! It's 7:30 already. Gotta go. It's my first class today too. Damn it! Everything's a mess. Students. Today we will study the C Major scale. C Major is an increasing scale, comprising of 7 notes. Do, Re, Mi, Fa, So, La, Ti. And then one more time. All together now three, four. Do, Re, Mi, Fa, So, La, Ti, Do. I'm tried, Let's just talk. Did you understand that? Do you understand when I speak? Today I'm so happy to teach you know to Love art, especially water colour. When doing art we have to use all our energy to form our imagination. Use our imagination to inspire something tangible. Now, water colours. There should be an abundance of water and colour. Every stroke can make something beautiful. Our imagination can form the picture we are still, but not asleep. Because if were asleep then we could not be still. Do you understands? We have to enhance... ...our feelings an imagination. Do you understand? If you understand imagination, the we can begin. Where are you going? You have no soul. This is art. I don't understand. Do you think I'm mad! Do you know that insanity and genius go hand in hand? Before we get started, I would like you all to introduce yourselves. As there are many new faces here today. I'm Pimpailin Saipan, 22 years old and I like to play Thai music. I'm Panthawil Tonpinij, 20 years old and I enjoy swimming. I'm Cholthcha Sutisunthoratham, 23 years old and I like painting. I'm Perapol Jitrangsan, 17 years old and I enjoy rugby. What should we do next, teacher? Sorry, I'm so sorry. I'm imaging to something. That we're introduced ourselves... ...what would you like us to do next, teacher? As it's your first day, I think I'll give you an easy task. I want you to write about the feelings you had... ...when you watched a love scene which impressed you most. Not long than one page. When you are finished I What's your name? I'm Peerapol Jitrangsan, ma'am. OK Perapol I want you to collect everybody's homework. Then this evening brig it to my room. But I have dancing practice then. Can't someone else do it? Time's up. OK, a bit later in the evening is fine, Perapol. If I'm not in the staff room the just leave it on my desk. That's all for today everybody. Come this way. Maybe we'll bump into the school's director. He likes to look for things to eat in the food court. He's an irregular eater. Is that him? No, that's Mr. Rawaeng he teaches different styles of painting. - What about him? - Him. Him with the white face. That's Mr. Phaitoon. But I don't know... ...who the young lady is. He teaches miming techniques. - Is it him? - Where? The one who's scolding the student in the red shirt. That's Mr. Somsak. He'll be retiring soon. He teaches criticism of movies. But no one respects him as he is too arrogant. I'm sure he'll to resign soon. This guy's the schools resident grandfather? Yep, something like that. What about this old caretaker that's coming this way? He must have been here before since the great-grandfather generation? Joy. This is Mr. Johnnie. Mr. Johnnie is our director. Sir, this is Penpan. Our new teacher for Thai cinematography, ...as well as social development. She's replacing Mr. Nirut, sir. What did you say, Biab? Good afternoon, Miss Penpan. How was your first day, was it hard? Good afternoon Director, I thought you were. Yes, she thought you would be much older. I'm 60 this year. But I guess some people just don't look their ago. Can you come and see me later? I would like to talk to you before you go home, ...in case there is something you would like me to help you with. I'm always happy to help you. Please keep that in mind. Certainly, Sir. I'll meet you as soon as I've finished my class. Good-bye. Your mouth almost made us lose our jobs. I'm sorry. He really looked like a custodian... ...and on that's 90 years old. Who would've thought he's the director, ...and that he'd be as wrinkly as that. Forget about it. Let's find some food instead. You're soaking with sweat. Have you just finished your dance class? We're off to see some girls. Come with us. You know Cherry, the one who studies ballet. She's cute. You go ahead, I have to take this report to Miss Penpan. I'll call you when I'm finished. See you later. Good luck, mate. Sorry Perapol. I'm really sorry. I saw the others leave so I thought no one was here. It's me that should be sorry. Is there anything you want me to do? No. But now that I've seen you. Don't forget to do the homework I gave you. I won't forget it, ma'am. When I finish this, I'll do the rest I'll hand in the homework immediately after the meeting and... ...the concert dance with my fellow students. Whatever. If you can't find me in my room. You can bring it to my home behind the university, ...as I've just met the Director... ...and he would like to see your reports tomorrow. Yes, I can do that. But did you say you wanted me to come to your home? Yes, It's the second house on the right from the beginning of the alley. It's not difficult to find. What the fuck is it, this time! Don't answer it. Keep on going, I'm just getting horny. I'm sorry, Joy. I must. We can carry on again after. It won't take long. Hello, who is it? Yes, sir. Immediately? No, I'm not busy sir. I can meet you in 15 minutes. Yes, it's convenient. It's not damn well convenient, we're horny! Why did you fucking interrupt us. It's nothing, sir. It's just the TV. I'll see you in a minute sir. You can't go and see someone else. What the hell is going on? It's a TV drama, sir. The stars are in the middle of an argument. I'll see you shortly, sir. That means you're not gonna finish, are you? I'm sorry Joy but a policeman's duty is to his citizens. Whatever the situation I must always be ready to work. Just wait here and I'll hurry back, my love. You're so worried about your work, asshole. Just piss off. I'll be gone for a minute, when I come back we can do it twice. - Don't be angry, my love. - Fuck off! Just go to work. I won't suck up to you, Pong. I can find someone else to do this for me. In fact you don't have any work to do, do you? This must be professor Penpan's house. Are you there, Ma'am? I brought you the reports. Teacher, are you there, Teacher? I'm sorry, Perapol. I'm taking a shower. Come in and wait. I'm nearly finished. Excuse me, I'm not troubling you, am I, ma'am? Make yourself at home, Perapol. It's no trouble. I'm here alone. Where would you like me to put the report. Put them on the glass table, and don't rush off. Stay and have something to eat. No problem, I haven't eaten yet and I can help you prepare the table. The food is in bags. I'll be going soon could you give me a hand. Yes, teacher. Are you going to eat now? Don't you want to get dressed first? You're not hungry yet, are you? If you could wait just a minute. Take you time. I can wait, I'm no that hungry. Help me! Perapol! Help me! What is it, teacher? What is it? Help me Perapol. It's a huge rat. My hair's all on end. Where is it, Teacher? I saw it over there. Where is it now? Where, where is it? I'll squash it myself. Have you found it, Perapol? What is it, Perapol? Your look so pale. Are you afraid of rats too? Come up on the bed with me. I'm not afraid of rats. I want to. What do you want, Perapol? Can I help you? Was that it? I can't see how that can be worse than mine. Actually I'm jealous. Yeah, it's a small mistake. You just got off with a student. It was just taking a youngster's virginity. It's not bad, trust me. Did your boyfriend come back, Joy? No, it was much worse then that. Who would've thought that. Joy, when you called, I though you would be coming this evening. Come in. Hello Dao. This is Pong my boyfriend. Hello. That's all for now, sir. That's why I started teaching near here. Because I missed you. I'm sorry, My first day was so busy, but today is Saturday so I'm free. It's no problem. You can see me anytime you're free, sis. Kaeng is upstairs, would you like to see him? Kaeng, you son? It's been 10 years. He must be a young man now. Where is my nephew? He's upstairs. He came home late last night because he was out... ...with his friends. I'll call him. Kaeng sweety, Auntie Joy is here. Yes, Mum. I coming. Sorry mum I was just having a shower. Hello Auntie Joy. Here's your nephew. This year he'll be 17. Actually I think he might study at your school Joy. Isn't that right Kaeng? Why do you two look so shocked? That situation has haunted me until this day. From a sin from an urge, ...a sin that cheats your lover, ...a sin with your own student. But retribution will be with me until the day I die. I can't hide from my nephew. I've got to see him sometime. I can't speak about this for the rest of my life. Are you still with policeman Joy? We split up 2 years ago. He never forget work and didn't have a clue about timing. It's better to stay alone with an egg plant. Are you still doing yourself with an egg plant, Joy? Stay in a temple, just for a while. Don't worry too much. Don't get too depressed Joy. Once you listen to my experience then you'll see that... ...yours and Ann's story is worthless. What! There's something worse than mine and Joy's situation. Definitely. Much, much worse. Jack, you don't have to drive so fast. It is dangerous. You haven't got a clue, just shut up! I didn't buy a sports car to drive slowly. What the fuck would that be good for? Just lean back, relax and don't argue, Goy! How can I relax when you're drive like crazy. Please, watch out, Jack. Sleep, so you won't see anything then. How the hell are you crossing the road? This is a car, not a dick. If it were I would have hit you already. I'm sorry. I was just crossing to get to a fashion shoot. I was using the zebra crossing. Right. Cindy, My mistake. Sometimes I drive like an idiot. I nearly caused an accident and made you late or even hurt, Cindy. Stop pinching, Goy that hurts. What are you looking at? I'm pissed off, OK! I almost hit a star. Acting like you're pissed off, with that stupid expression on your face. I felt sorry for her. She's a woman, one of the weaker sex. You said we were gonna watch a movie. Here you go, porno. What do you want to watch, Western, Japanese, Thai. They have them all here. But I want to watch "Three". We've tried very hard and it took us so long to get tickets for it. It's a full house. I don't want to see that! I want to have sex. Do you understand? If you don't want to, just go home. Jack, it's so like you. Sex on the brain! I've got to take car to the garage. Don't forget the party tonight at 10.00 pm Pick me up from home. Yes, my lord and master. You're so bossy! DRINK SOLD BY MEN! Are you interested, beautiful lady? Would you can for? Is it read? Yes, it is. Ice tea, the cool heart of Thailand. It's ready. Ice tea, ice tea sold by a handsome man. Flowers. - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. Goy. Hello, Pang! How are you? Same as usual. We must have lunch sometime, Gotta go. Bye. Bye. Boom, how are you? Things are so heavy! Why? Really, really heavy. What, about that gossip? No, these books are do damn heavy. Talk to you later. One copy of Cosmopolitan, please, Thiwa. That's 80 Bath, please. 100 Baht given. Don't worry about a bag. Here's your change. Next week is our annual sale. Come and have a look. I will if I'm free. I live just on this road, but rarely come to buy any books, myself. Good luck, take care. Sorry for surprising you, sis. Who are you calling, sis? What do you want? Don't get angry. I just. What! Do you need passengers? I'm sorry but my home is not far from here. Wait just a minute! You dropped this. I was bringing it back to you. Sorry. I thought you were a pervert. There are so many around, ...it's getting scary. Thank you so much. Please, call me Chad. I'm based at the end of the road. Next time try to be more careful. Your purse is very small, it can fall out easily. I won't trouble you anymore. Anyway, thank you Chad. Why do we have to come to this traders in Thai ducks party. There's nothing special here. Soon you will know that this party has something, for sure. Come on. It's the same everywhere we go. Just go inside. Easy, easy! The wounds from today haven't healed yet. This is wrong, this isn't a meeting of diamond traders. It's a party for people to sell ducks. Ducks! That's why everyone is asking about our poultry. What did they say to you? They asked if our ducks had big eggs. I don't know what they're selling here but our party is two roads down. Good. Come on let's go. We'll miss the cutting of the ribbon. Hello, have you been here long? My god, why do you look so old? Carry on. What's up, you great musician? This is my girlfriend. See you later. Hello. All the old ones are here. This is my girlfriend, Hello. I've heard that the minister Chaiwat's wife had an abortion. Really, she's pregnant at the age of 40? The minister is still strong. Who told that's his kid? It's her secret husband's kid instead. It's something wrong for sure! It's like this, there would be no compassion for anyone. It's very ashamed. Hello, I haven't seen you for ages. You're very beautiful now. Thank you. You too. Those diamonds around your neck are gorgeous. So beautiful that they hurt you're eyes, nearly causing a cataract. It's only a few carats. Not so expensive, about US$ 72,000. - Hello, Lady Jintanawadee. - Hello Goy. I don't think admire like this kind of party. What's party? I don't understand. It's a swinging party. People come today because they like it. I'm quite jealous of you. You have a girlfriend with such an open heart as Goy. Usually only people 30 years old or more come here. But, Goy is probably the youngest person in the party. Look grey hairs and dark skin Goy. Have you brought me here for the men? Calm down, will you, Goy? They're into swapping. It's a cool man's party once you've tried it... ...you'll love it. Love it yourself, you pervert! Darling, come back! Where are you going? Jack you asshole you have a girlfriend. We're over! Are you insane, taking me to give to your friends. Are you still human? Fucking hell, ...what's wrong with my car now! What's wrong? Shit. Why is today such a bad. God my telephone is looked in the car too. What can I do? What's wrong with your car? It's you, again. It's small world. I thought that for today I was out of luck. Can you have a look at my car Chad? Thank you for remembering my name. Let's have a look, Goy? It looks bad. I expect we'll have to take it to the garage. Try to start it first. How can I start it? I left the keys and phone in the car. I can't call anyone. If that's the case, then we should get out of this rain. After the it's died down I'll take you to garage. Whatever, Chad. If I stay here any longer I'll catch my death of cold. As long as you don't mind riding the motorcycle of a poor chap like me. Climb on. If we stay here we'll drown. That's twice you've helped me today, Chad. I'll have to say thank you properly, some time. Thank you so much for taking me out of the rain. But, I'm so very cold. It might be a bit too dark. But look at this oil lantern. Here I'll light it. Why are you here, alone with a broken car? Where's your boyfriend? The man I see pick you up so often. Don't even talk about him. He's just a waste of time. Psycho! I'm sorry I shouldn't have asked. You're shivering are you very cold? Cold can't you see my chin shivering? What can we do? Unfortunately, my clothes are wet too. Is it OK if I ask to keep you warm by holding you close to me. To embrace is a natural way to exchange heat throughout the body. I studied it at school. That's so sweet. How can you imagine that, that is worse than Joy or I? There's nothing wrong with having sex with a motorbike taxi guy... ...and he sound quite handsome. Don't tell me that Jack spotted the two of you. That's not it. Goy said, shortly after that, ...Jack was raped through his back door at the party wasn't he. Yes, Jack got his retribution. But for me it wasn't over. It's still raining. Do you want to play in it? Can I just rest a bit? OK. But can you follow me, then we can wash each other. What do you lot want? Don't come here. Please! Don't! My god! The Whole lot. The were like giants, and they took me in every position, ...but there was still some luck. What! You think that was lucky? I think it was lucky because everyone wore a condom. If they hadn't, now I would have a baby but no father for it. I feel so sorry for you Goy. But, yours still isn't the worst one yet, trust me. Don't say that your story is even more bizarre than ours, Maem. Go on then us, sitting there so quiet. Did you find a man too? Don't say that you were raped by a regiment of Red-Wah soldiers? This in not about quantity. It's the most sinful act a person could do. It's too difficult to explain. It happened only about a year ago. Good morning, boss. The "Thailand-Daily" Program wants wants you at the studio... ...no later than 2:00 P.M. It's almost 1 o'clock now. Let me clear up some things first, then we can go. Here's your bag. Thanks. Mr. Chairote is waiting to show the presentation you ordered... ...and Ms. Arisa wants to make suggestions for the advertising... ...budget for Toto Company which produces "Orgasm"-Condom. Ask them to meet me, now. Disgusting! Did you turn your brain on before you started this job? Mr. Chairote, ...you're not even the tiniest bit suitable to work for CPDI. But I did everything just as you had told me to do. Don't argue. I would never have ordered such inferior work. How can you say such a thing? Do it over again. With a more suitable ending. Finish it today and place it on my table. Today? How am I supposed to do it in time? This presentation alone took me two weeks to complete. If you can't do it, you can resign. Once I've returned from recording the Thai-Politics-Daily-Program, I want to see your work on my desk. Do you understand? I understand. I'll do my best, Ma'am. Bitch! She gives orders while only caring about herself, insane Tom-boy. I guess you must have got in real trouble. If she's unhappy today, ...she's probably got a lot of pressure from to the TV show. Somsri, Arisa can come in now. Please, Arisa, you may go in now. I'm in big shit! I have read your plan, and you've done an excellent job. The customers money is being used well. Thank you, boss. Is there anything you would like me to improve or add? I would like you to try to add something to our campaign... ...activities so we can introduce condoms during an... ...activity with Patpong District or a campaign by the Ministry... ...of Public Health. Yes, boss. I'll complete a summary ready for your approval immediately. Regarding our share, only 10-20% should go to us. This is a social issue with little impact on business. Just work on improving their reputation a bit, that will do! Fine. I'll get the ball rolling right away. Somsri has asked Boonsong to get the car ready in 5 minutes. I'm going downstairs. Who now? Come in. Somsri, What is it? The program would like appearing guests to wear a dress during the show. Ms. Maem, would you like to change here or at the studio? OK, I'll get changed, then we can go. Can you tell Boonsong to get ready. Somsri, can you take care of the office whilst I'm gone? Would you like anyone to accompany you to the studio? No, it's not necessary, I'm all grown up now. If I go by myself, then we won't waste any work time. What are you doing down there? This is a company not a playground! I'm sorry, Ma'am. I dropped a 10 Baht coin down there and... ...I was just trying to get it back. Are you the new guard? Stand up, so I can talk to you! Yes, Ma'am. My name's Kampoon Nongkratok and ...I am the new security Guard, Ma'am. You look strong and high-spirited, is that only during the day? Do you take a nap at night? I've never slept on duty, ma'am. And I have an, "Employee of the Month" certificate, ...form my last employer to prove it, ma'am. That won't be necessary. When I come back to the office we can continue this conversation. Do you work all the night? I work from midday to midnight, ma'am. She's so vicious but her figure is so mouth-watering. Don't sneak up on me like that. You almost gave me a heart attack. Don't be so smutty or you won't be here long. She's the head of this company. Sorry, I'm not well informed, I've just started here. Remember! If you really want to stay here, keep to yourself. Don't jump, don't leap, don't boil, don't heat up. Do things just steadily. Thank you so much. Sometimes one needs someone to soothe, understand and talk with. Good you understand. Now I'll show you the company's CCTV System. It covers some important areas. What's wrong now, Boonsong? Is the car broken? Sorry, boss. The car might have the hic-ups. What? That's the first time I've heard that. Hurry, or they'll be waiting for us. Don't worry, boss. We'll be there in under ten minutes. Good evening, Anchaleeporn, Boonyod. It's an honour to have you as our guest tonight. Sorry, for bothering you during your afternoon working time like this. Usually our show is live, but today we have to tape it. Yes. Unfortunately next week the two of us have to go abroad... ...on an urgent matter. No problem. I'm happy to have the honour to be on your show. I nearly forgot. This is the famous columnist Doy Adner. He will be the guest appearing before you. Mr. Adner, this is Maem Premika. Good Evening, Doy. We're met before at your book anniversary party a few months ago. Do you remember me? Of course. You are beautiful by both day and night. Your last advertisement was fantastic. Thank you very much, I have to praise the whole team for it. Besides, the media, like you Mr. Doy, gave us great support. That's why it because so well-known. I think you both should go and get your hair and make up done. It'll be Doy's turn first. And you, Maem, could just wait for one minute? Sure! I've got no urgent matters to attend today. We'll have someone brief you on the script while your waiting. We're ready for your spot now Doy. Maem. Will you wear that dress on set? Yes, is it OK? I don't have many dresses. It's very beautiful, sexy around the chest too. Ladies and Gentlemen, over the past 2-3 weeks there has been a new, ...much talked about commercial on the TV. It's about what you just saw. Today we can talk with the person who dreamt up this commercial. She's very famous and has individually created this commercial. Who can it be? It can be nobody else but. Please put your hands together for Miss Premika. Hello and welcome. Is this, who everyone reckons is a lesbian. How can she be a lesbian she's too sexy. Look, you can see right up her skirt. Where did you come up with a concept such as this? First I must explain. What we are currently showing is forbidden... ...in this country. I think it works when you can deceive everyone that at first the plot is... ...one thing but in the end it's different. It wasn't just me who made this we all brain-stormed hard together. I hold this production in high esteem. It has something that no other movie has. What about the news that sorry about to ask about this, but we must ask that you are in fact a lesbian? Why, just because a girl works, has short hair and wears pants, ...does that make her a lesbian? I had no intention to come across like that. It's information from another source. It's not news it's just a rumour don't read too much into it. I think it's better if we continue talking about work. Sorry for bothering you but could I ask a personal question? Do you have a boyfriend? This is a question from our audience. I'm not answering those kind of questions. It's private. Please could we change the subject? If you don't want to talk about it, that's OK. Let's go back to the subject of work. In the future do you feel you might want to make a Thai movie. I'm not sure. At present I think it will be better to stay in advertising I don't know what I would like to do best. Checking the porn during work time are you? No, just looking. Give it here! I'm gonna tell the boss and get your ass fired. Don't do it again! No problem it's in my memory now. Good. They won't be finished for aged. Move your hand faster. Maem. Oh, Maem. I can't take it any longer. What are you doing? Boonsong! Shit! When did you finish. What are you doing? Let's go, you're wasting time. Nothing boss. I was just. Nothing? You're insane! When did you start the car it wastes so much gas. Go back to the office. What's this? How can a book like this get in my car Boonsong? It's. I'm sorry, boss. Just a minute ago I found it in the toilet. I don't know who left it here. And when I left it was in my hand. Boonsong, you're despicable. Don't let me find out it's yours. You old enough to know better. Don't embarrass yourself by being fired... ...for reading porn during work hours. Go and watch the road. This must be Chairote's work I should pressure him more often. I'll look at it tomorrow. - Why are you so vile? - Fuck, Who is that Boon? This is an office not a sleazy hotel! God, when did you get back? Look enough to see this. You! Get out of my office... ...now I didn't order any chicken to be delivered. Just a minute, hear me out first. I deliver pizza not chicken. Now you want to get cocky. You should leave before I call your boss. Boon, Come to my room now! I have to go to her office, but don't worry it's nothing. After this and you reckon it's nothing. I'm so embarrassed. Tan. Whatever will be will be, see you later. I don't know how to scold you to fit your behavior. Why did you do that? Boon, Why did you behave like an animal in my office? I didn't intend to, Ma'am. My girlfriend came and. You didn't Intend to. Of course you think it's normal. Your brain only produces low-life thoughts. It's no surprise you became a guard. I want to know who taught you... ...or did you just follow in the family footsteps. Why are you looking at me like that. Don't you realize your mistake. I realize it. I'm a person. You have no right to blame my family. They're not involved I'm the asshole. Why can't I criticize you? Who do you think you are? You're Fired. I'm Fired? Great, but before I go I have something to give you. You son of a bitch. Fuck off. What can a bastard like you give me? I'm gonna get right in you I'll be your husband tonight? What are you doing? Your insane! Let me go! You Bastard! Polite! Your gonna get in double for that. I'm gonna split your legs. Stop you crazy fucker. Let me go. Are you enjoying it boss? Do whatever you want, I'm ready for it! I can't see how that's worse. You had it with one guard. Honestly, Joy? Did anyone notice? Or did someone record it on video? Yes, every gesture, every action was recorded. What did you say? That night everywhere we went was recorded on the security cameras. How is it? Is it good? Great. I think if we can sell this. It's much better than taping an MP From Taiwan. Whatever, but don't forget to make me a copy. No problem. How can I keep something like this to look at all by myself? With words like that you should be a singer. Thanks. Was it really as bad as that, Maem? I believe you now, yours was the worst. I think I watched the video and though the person looked familiar. What did you do? There's more. Poon has Aids which means I contacted HIV from him. The worst thing a person can do is to not take precautions when having sex. You were lucky. It doesn't matter if you were wrong you, you always had safe sex. That's better! What a relief! The electricity's back. That pot is starting to wear off now. Do you want another before bed. It's better if we sleep, we won't wake up late tomorrow. I'm taking you on a trip. Don't change the topic. Everyone else has talked about themselves. Come on tell us, or we'll kick you. OK what do want to know. My experience isn't that interesting. Don't be like that, just tell us. Whatever happened you must tell us. Yes, don't take advantage of us. You already know about our experiences. You really want to know? Stop beating around the bush! It's late! OK then, don't complain, it's not that interesting. It happened only a few days ago. What would you like, Miss? Jack Daniel's on the rocks, please. My next song is for all the girls who are alone tonight. Maybe after... ...this song you might find someone you want to take home. How is it. Have you found anyone yet? Nope. Usually the women find me first. Like the last time. When that girl that found you and stole your car. It's better than you. I heard that someone got your condo. When you go out like us, you expect to loose some things. Like they say... ..."our labour makes us rich but a pretty woman can make us poor" Pong, Hi there. Did you come to get a ghost or a woman. I'm always working. Did you hear about the ghost that lives here. Are you crazy? What ghost. I come here nearly everyday and I've never heard of it. Really! They said that many young men have already disappeared. Disappeared? If they disappeared that means they with a woman you fool. Anyway I've gotta meet my friend. See you later. - Be careful, Pay! - Pong what is it with you? I'm just warning you. Thank you very much. That's all for tonight. Good night. Next some music from our DJ, Thank you. Pay, Hi there! Goh. Is that your wife? Yep. Goh, I must warn you as a friend. Singers like us... ...should not take our. Just look at yourself. - I understand, thanks. - OK go take care of your wife. After work let's go home together. I know why you watch me like this. If I didn't you'd disappear all night again. You piss me off, I said I was working! That's what you always say! We'll see if after work you go somewhere else or not. Shit, if you drink like that you'll throw up everywhere. I'm just gonna take a piss. Don't go anywhere. Excuse me, The beauty at the counter asked me to give you this. 2nd male toilet, on the left. When my wife comes back, tell her I went upstairs to see my boss. Don't worry, I'll tell her. You've gotta take risks to find pleasure. Shall we leave together. Where are we gonna go? Are you scared. I promise I won't sell you. I know your name is Jum. I'll ask again shall we go to your house or a hotel? You're a busy girl, you slut! Where's my friend? I said where's my friend? Not telling? Take it easy. Let's talk about it. Fuck of! Where's my friend? Tell me where he is? Calm down. What is it? We can talk it through? Fuck you! Stay out of this! It's between me and her. Don't be so tough on her. If you want to be involved! It's OK with me. Sorry, Calm down it's OK. You'd better talk nicely to each other. You see, she's a girl. You can just talk. Do you know this guy? Nope! Probably been an escape from an asylum somewhere. Do you want me to take him to the police? No, it's OK. Just tie him up. Now lets continue with us. We can come back to him later. Is that it? Where's the sin in that? Or, is it there something else you've left unsaid. It's a sin because come morning all men that have sex will be... ...turned into pigs. That's hilarious. You can make a good story. No one's better at black humor than you. Jum if you don't have anything to tell, ...you don't have to exaggerate like that. Don't to lie to us. Please, don't say that the pork we just ate is really from one of them. It's exactly that. How did it taste? Stop playing about Jum. It's so late, maybe we should go to bed. Your story was hilarious. I've gotta remember to tell this to everyone. Be careful they might laugh in your face. Who can believe a story about witches and ghosts. My god what is it! Jum what's happened? How did you do that? What's up with you? Don't say that you really are a witch! God help me! My friend is a witch. Please help me! I'm not afraid of death I've already got Aids. Do what you will. It's not time to die. You've still got time to listen to more of my story. Maybe you'll recognise Some of it. You have always looked at me as a misfit. You always spited me. I was the butt of all your jokes. But I could bear it, I believed that you were my friends. Even if nobody saw that I was a person just like you. Until the most embarrassing time... I had to endure in my life. It started like a lovely dream which nobody could refuse... ...in the end I lost my virginity without even knowing what happened. Pay up! Cool. You had Jum in just 2 days. I shouldn't have taken the bet. He's as good as that chap Sura, ...and you mess around with my younger brother. How dare you? Good, It was so boring, it was like sleeping with a tree. Have you heard the proverb "Love grows from a seed to a tree"? Come on, pay up. Refreshing. Gimme yours. But what I could not stand was that I was made ignorant and... ...stupid, like a pig or a dog. People did whatever they liked to me. I has no real friends, I was just your slave. That's when I decided, I wanted get my revenge on everyone. That's the reason why I suddenly left you all. I went to America. But I didn't go to study at University, like you thought I went to study witchcraft. Where did you study. The same place as that famous Harry. OK. Do you know a lot of magic? No, I studied two majors, ...the first one you already know about. That every man who sleeps with me will become a pig by morning. And the other was curses to make us horny, right? Everything that happened to you was not a curse. It came from a mixture that I put in your drinks. This stimulated your hormones and threw into a frenzy. Did you put spell on us to tell you about our experiences. No, you told them because you were high on Ganja. My second major in witchcraft was how I made our friends disappear. Just like you were wondering earlier. Because if anyone finds out that I am witch... ...they will be turned into This. And you were the last four of our group. Remember well, if anyone finds out about my experience and starts telling... ...other people, ...you know what will happen.
