Thank you Congratulations Congratulations - Body of Christ - Amen - Body of Christ - Amen Body of Christ - Amen Bod.. - Body of Christ - Amen Good afternoon dear listeners at CX8, Radio Saratí in Montevideo broadcasting through the international free channel How would you like your meat? - Raw. - Ok, let's bring another one because this one is dry Remember Don Carlos? He narrated games and used to say: "With a sky full of nimbus clusters and and audience close to 50.000 people.. Ah, I used that technique. It's great. It worked well with any text, whether classbooks or Lenin's. Did you read Lenin using the Speed Reading technique? It was useful. Look, I started on the first paragraph then I repeated the last one three times. No stops. After that, of course I read the whole chapter. - It was terrific. Didn't you use it? - No. Never. I did. If it had not been for that method I would never have graduated as a doctor. - Don't scare me. Where do you work at? I am a forensic doctor. Oh my God - I'm starving. Would you eat something? - In a moment. Ok. I'm taking this wine with me. How is it like to be a mother? You can't imagine. Well, Diego wanted you to attend his wedding. There must be a reason for it. Yeah. There must be a reason. He will have to accept his mother even when he was told such bad things about her. He accepted you as wedding godmother. You know this ritual is important to him. Amarí passes the ball. Go ahed, Carlitos go to your mother and then you'll go with us. The guy was illegally there. Everything is soccer to him. Soccer is like any other vice. Here comes the best part. In a wealthy neighborhood, under a sky full of nimbus clusters the wedding of the year takes is about to start The priest shares the hosts among the attendees. Will he feel like giving one to the godmother? He chews the tragedy. As if she came from the darkness, the voice of the godmother resounds in the temple: I'll never be on my knees. The groom starts to tremble. Oh no, please don't you mess with the jerk groom.. The godmother refused to eat the host. Later, when she got to the house in the town she pounced on some chitlins and crushed them. Careful Miguel, don't you eat your own tongue. Did you miss all this, Liliana? - Do you guys barbecue everyday? - Nah But really, when are you coming back? I still have things to do there. I suppose I'll come back at some point. I really want you to come back. Thank you - I'll get some wine - Go ahead. - So, Do we sing "Black Rooster, Red Rooster"? - Yeah, that one. Ok. When the black rooster sings, it's because the day is over If the red rooster sang, then another rooster would sing. If I lie let the wind take away all that I sing Go on and keep moving. Look at the camera. Chin down. There you go. That's it. There. There. Keep moving. There Stay still. Ok. There. There it goes. Chin down. I like it there. I like it. Keep it. Now your profile. Inés, we can do it better. Unmount the camera, please. Let's see. That's it. Let me get a bit close. Chin down. There it goes. Good. Loved it. FAST MONTEVIDEO - Hi. How are you? - Hi Liliana. How you doing? Granpa was already getting a bit nervous. I thought I knew the way to get here. But no. - Go inside. He'll be happy to see you. - Nice. Thanks Liliana - Hello - How are you? - Some mate? - No After 15 days in Montevideo, I'm green and haven't recovered yet, you see? - It looks like I'm more Uruguayan than you. - It's true. - Come with me. Have a seat. - Thanks. Go on spill the beans. How was everything over there? First this. This side first and then the other. "For the Galician: 'Hurray for those who fight'". ..Magu.. - The black one. - Of course. - The red one. - That's it. - Who is this one? - Who is this one? - He is Lupa (Magnifying Glass*) - Lupa? Anyone would identify him. Not a single hair left on this jerk. That's mean. As if you had a lot of hair left. Well, I always was Old Venerando. - But Lupa looked like a Guinea Pig. Such long hair. - You're right. Look at him. Always near the food. It was the easiest way to recognize him. Tita would had called him "Bottomless Pit". Tita A.K.A. Granma María. I know. She was specialist in "berretines", crammed sausages and fig jam. She claimed the fig tree was the only responsible for that fig jam. And it was true. The fig tree made the difference and not the figs from one continent or another. That same fig tree. And the unmatched figs it gave. So special, so unique. Just like Tita. - What are those "berretines"? - Hideouts, hidden compartment furniture.. - Granma? - Yes. - I thought that was your business. - Young people don't know anything. Come here. Take a picture of your grandpa and me. Now she is a famous photographer. Someday I'll tell you how she learned her craft. Thanks That's nice. How is your son? He remains there. Married.. and motherless as always. You will have dinner and spend the night with us. - No. I really can't. - Not a word about it. You're your own boss. You can leave tomorrow or in three days. - I really can't. - We'll talk later. Corunna, Galicia. WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT? PHOTOGRAPHIES BY LILIANA PEREIRA Shit Graciela, how you doing? How is this life going? My son doesn't answer the phone. I don't know about him. The usual thing. I was at Venerando's place today. Do you know the name of the store he opened here? FAST MONTEVIDEO SHOE STORE No! Always the same. - Tell me, how is the exhibition so far? - On schedule. We will inaugurate it in two weeks. I'll send you the poster sketch tomorrow to see if you like it. - And you said Diego is not answering? - No. He doesn't answer. It's been a long time since I got life signals from him. - Well, he will eventually answer, won't he? - I don't know. I don't have any news. And I don't wait for them. As you know, that family still thinks I am some kind of demon. - I see you don't know about the "Our Heroes" video - No. What heroes? Our soldiers in a mission of peace. They uploaded a video on youtube showing some soldiers raping a boy. The soldiers uploaded it themselves. After 30 years they are still there? Nobody stops them? - They were already identified, but there is still no one arrested. Neither them nor their masters. I don't understand how the government doesn't do anything about it. These guys will keep torturing others anytime they want. We are going to meet tomorrow to see what we can do. I'll be in touch. Soon they will pay for everything. I don't know. - I'll tell you how the meeting was. Ok? - Ok. Go ahead and take pictures because I think it will rain in the afternoon. Roberto Roberto - I'm a grandmother - What? - I'm a grandmother! I'm a grandmother. I just found out I'm a grandmother. Have a look. Aww look at her. Isn't she beautiful? Let's celebrate. Bye.. I can't believe they waited until she was born to tell me. I can't believe it. They didn't want to disappoint you in case she was born super-ugly. But she is so beautiful. Look at her. Yes, a bit more beautiful than the other 20 times you showed her to me. I'm not going to give in. They took my son away from me and now they won't do the same with my granddaughter. Here. They won't stopped me from being my granddaughter's grandmother. Grandsons can smooth things out. Don't be so sure. It is impossible there can be a good understanding between my family, Diego's family and me. It's impossible. They will stop me from getting close to the baby. They will surely do. You have a gift, Lila. You know how to tell people's stories in a very special way. You will be able to tell your granddaughter who are you. Resist, unite and fight! Let's defeat the dictatorship! Resist, unite and fight! Let's defeat the dictatorship! Against fascism and capital! Hurray for Socialism and Freedom! Against fascism and capital! Hurray for Socialism and Freedom! Resist, unite and fight! Let's defeat the dictatorship! Resist, unite and fight! "BEING UNITED IS A MATTER OF LIFE OR DEATH" - So? Everything's alright? - Everything's good. How does it look? - Good job, huh. - Thanks. - They are nice. - Pablito. - Hey Liliana. Everything was great - So great. We need to schedule many more like this one. People are giving a good response. - It's cold. -You can heat it at the end of the hall. You know where. - Pelos is missing. - He'll be here shortly. Yeah. - How many flyers will you tint? - It'll be enough for three wet loads. You are tinting acts of resistance, not getting wet loads. Comb the ground! research everything! Fast! Hey you back there! There is nobody in here! Gimme the money! Gimme! Take it. Coat and shoes too. Mom. Liliana. Where are you? Carlos just came looking for Diego. I told you not to call him. He is Diego's father. And I didn't know where you were at. Shit. I asked you to wait. Listen up: think about what you are doing. You will lose your son. I'll call him later. - Where are you? - I'll call you later Where are you, Liliana? - Hi Carlos. - Liliana. - How is Diego? -Liliana, please where have you been? - How is little Diego? - He is Ok. Liliana, you didn't even call or anything. - You've abandoned your son. - We'll discuss that later. How is he? If you'd care about him, he'd be with you right now, and not going from one house to another. What the fuck are you up to? - Is something happening to him? - He doesn't have a mother. That's what's happening. - Pass me to him so he can hear me. - Not now. He is fine sleeping on his bed. - When are you coming? - Around 5 pm. Good. And listen up: if you don't come today you won't ever see him again - Is that clear? - 5 pm. SUBVERSIVE GROUP DISMANTLED THE END OF A TERRORIST ORGANIZATION. - I thought they had caught you too. - I thought the same about you. It's horrible, Lila. Pablo is dead. Juan and the girl are wounded at the Military Hospital. - How about the others? - In jail, all of them. All of them, except you and those of us who were not at the storehouse. We can't be here. The purse with my I.D. is at the storehouse. Holy Shit! We are fucked up! Do you have a place to spend the night? I have to pick up my son before they go looking for me. He is at his father's house. It'll be better if he stays there. They might be looking for you. I can't. What are we going to do with a child? We can't even take care of ourselves. I can't Graciela. You don't know Carlos. He'll try to take him away from me. We need to look for a place to spend the night. I don't like this at all. Don't worry. Turn to the left. Don't turn. Keep going. Don't turn. They are there. What do I do? - Son of a bitch. He handed me over to them. - What do I do? - What do I do? - Go on. Go on. He handed me over to them. FAST GALICIA - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. Give me a moment. I'll be right back. I need it for tomorrow. Is it possible? - Yes. In the afternoon - See you tomorrow then. Cheer up comrade. - All set? - Yes Who said changing this shitty world was going to be easy. They are shattering us, Galician. They killed Pablito. One by one they are knocked down. There is no beaten one that cannot stand up again. We only need little Diego's picture now and you'll have all the required documents. Would you like to see how I develop them? Knowing how to do these things is always useful, huh? We need to get a picture of the child. It's going to be difficult. I need to find a moment in which little Diego is with my mother. They think you don't care about the child. That's on your favor. Are you sure I can stay here for so long? You just saw how Tita is crazy about teaching you how to make photos. You know her. I can't tell who will have to be patient about the other person. "..with a precision that many recognized as a record, more than 30,000 Uruguayan workers and technicians ..tell others and share experiences than can be applied in other constructions across the country." I had sworn I wasn't going to watch them anymore. "Communicate 1307 from Joined Forces. "During the operation carried out against a subversive group yesterday in Montevideo "..Juan Pablo Garasouto, one of the main leaders, was killed in action. During the raid, José María González Rodó y Juan Carlos Errando AKA El Pelos were arrested. For being related to this subversive group, we need to capture Graciela Gamiseria Andrade AKA González or Galician Uruguayan, single, 19 years old, Medicine Student, black hair, light eyes, white skin. Last known address: Piedras 2010, Montevideo. - Liliana Pereira Echavarría, Uruguayan, married.." - Those rotten souls don't even give me a day to rest. "Art Student, blonde hair, green eyes, white skin. Last known address: Vieja 2812, Montevideo. María del Carmen Rodríguez Rodríguez, 20 years old, Medicine Student, AKA The black one, dark hair, ..brown eyes, white skin. Last known address: Avenida Pedro Figari 1518, Montevideo." This is the last one. The best fig jam in the worldly world. I'll go get spoons. lest these fuckers come to get us and end up eating our jam. That would be the end. Sweet little pussy.. I'd eat you all. Stay still or I'll shoot. I am Liliana Pereira! They are kidnapping me! - So, you thought you could flee, didn't you? - They are kidnapping me! - They are kidnapping me! - You'll have time to tell me all you want. What are you looking at? Stay right where you are. - Go back with the others. - I am Liliana Pereira. They are kidnapping me! - Let's go. Let's go. - Stay where you are. Let's go. DOWN WITH THE DICTATORSHIP Let's see if you still pretend to be smart here. Go on. Let's go. Don't be so lazy, babe. Do you know who I am? I am asking you, Who am I? No. How come you don't know? How come you don't know? All of you here know who I am. I am Major Emilio Garone. What does it say here? Do you know how to read? Babe, make yourself up to the idea ..that you will speak. By hook or by crook, you will speak. Those who come are brave at the beginning, but all of them end up speaking. All you have to do is helping us to complete it. The marked ones are caught just like you. And depending on how they behave, they can end up like this. They should had informed you wrongly Liliana, blonde, Lila, or whatever the fuck they call you. Apparently, you think that if you don't look at me you will eventually be released. The only way to get away from here is if I allow it. Understood? And I will only allow it if you start to help us now. Understood? Here she comes. Come here skinny. Take it off. All of it. Don't make me waste my time. Take it off. Go on. Take it all off I'm telling you. Are you deaf? Don't you listen? Take it off, I'm telling you. Take it all off. You will even tell me about the first time you ever ate in your life, you blonde Go ahead, blonde, go ahead. Speak, blonde, speak. Go ahead, start. Shall we talk? Won't you speak? Let me go. Okay, give me some music, maestro. Who is your connection? Don't make fun of me, fucking asshole. Where is the fig house? I don't know! I don't know! Who lives at the fig house? - Speak the fuck up! - I don't know! You will speak, asshole. Everybody does it. Otherwise how do you think we found you? I don't know! Where is the fig's house? I don't know what you're talking about! Don't you dare to take it off. Remember that obeying is the main virtue here, kid. Bring me the skinny boy and girl we catched yesterday Don't look at them. In the line! How quiet and clean you are today. Looks like you all were waiting for us, right? Let's see what we got here. Are you cold? Daddy is going to warm you up. Which one do you like? Come on. You can choose. Easy there. You like it? Tell me you like it. Bring the blonde upstairs. The one next to the motorcycles. C'mon. Liliana, Liliana. You are pretty. Intelligent. Raised in a wealthy family. You have a beautiful son. I truly don't know how you got involved in this in such a stupid way. Instead of dedicating yourself to your house, to your husband, to any lover.. Women like you are born for other things. Tell them I'm sick and I need to be taken to a hospital. I can't tell them that. The thing is you are strong, Liliana. But you have to change your attitude. Being friends with them has privileges. But to be one, you'll have to collaborate. If you behave well you will be able to go out and see your son. I promise that to you. Don't play the smart one. You have to choose. Do what they say and you'll be free to see your son, or else, he can come here and see what they do to his mom. You are wrong. This asshole girl thinks I'm an idiot. Do you think I am an idiot you can fool that easy? Where the fuck is the fig house? You will talk asshole. You will talk.. ..or you will blow up. Understood? Look at me when I speak to you, piece of shit! Who are those at the fig house? Who makes the passports? I don't know. The truth is I don't know. "The truth is.." "The truth" she says. Now you will know what the truth is. You will want to die but it is not going to be that easy. Many of you want to die each night here. And that is not going to happen until I do not feel like it. Got it? Tie her over there. - Open your legs, blonde. - Open your little legs. There you go. That's it. There you go. Say, are you comfy? Everybody out of here! You, play that music. Play it. Is this what you were looking for, asshole? PUNTA DE REYES PENITENTIARY, URUGUAY Combray at a distance, from a twenty-mile radius, as we used to see it from the railway when we arrived there every year in Holy Week, was no more than a church epitomizing the town, representing it, speaking of it and for it to the horizon, and as one drew near, gathering close about its long, dark cloak, sheltering from the wind, on the open plain, as a shepherd gathers his sheep, the woolly grey backs of its flocking houses, which a fragment of its mediaeval ramparts enclosed, here and there, in an outline as scrupulously circular as that of a little town in a primitive painting. - To live in, Combray was a trifle depressing, like its streets.. - Is this OK? - Keep it, but not that tight. Like this. - It should be loose. It's OK. Continue at the top. - ...there were so dark that one had, as soon as the sun began to go down, to draw back the voiles in the sitting-room windows. What are these voiles? - They might be curtains. - Yes, like blinds or something like that. ...streets with the solemn names of Saints, ..the Rue Saint-Hilaire, the Rue Saint-Jacques. these Combray streets exist in so remote a quarter of my memory, painted in colours so different from those in which the world is decked for me today, that in fact one and all of them, seem to me now more unsubstantial than the projections of my magic-lantern My grandfather's cousin—by courtesy my great-aunt—with whom we used to stay, ..was that aunt who, since her husband's (my uncle Octave's) death, had gradually declined to leave, first Combray, then her house, then her bedroom, and finally her bed. and who now never came down, but lay perpetually.. Shut up Gloria She didn't even grab the fork. She hasn't eaten anything. Shut up! They are getting close to the gate. Oh no, they will call me soon and I'm not ready yet. Wait. You look beautiful. It's dry. I just finished. - Raise your head. You look so pale. - Yeah. I don't want them to see me like this. Look at this one. - Do you like it? - Yes, but it doesn't have a neck. They won't let me use it. Let's try this one. Gloria! - Your sister is there with Enrique. - Enrique? Has he grown up? He is so big. Let me see. I think it fits me. - Does it? - It's pretty. - I think so. - I like it. - Can you let me see for a moment? - Yeah, sure. I don't see my mother. She always finds an excuse for not bringing him here. She never brings him here. She doesn't write me. - 715 - Lila! That's you! - Do I look good? - Beautiful Dieguito. Do you remember me? I'm mom. Are you upset? Are you upset with me? ..five, six, seven, eight, - ..nine - Nine? You know how to count. Feel my cold nose.. Look.. I brought you this. Have a look. It's a little surprise. His name is Puffy. Do you like him? Every time you see him, you will remember me. Because I am always thinking about you, Diego. And about Puffy too from now on. - Are you hungry? - I am not, sir. Tell your grandma to bring you back here. Give me a hug. Get up. Get out. Get out! Attention! Did you all think you got rid of us? If you believed that, how wrong you were. I have information about all you do and do not inside this place. You can be sure that you all girls are in my mind. I have you here. Don't forget about it. Remember it every day and night. I don't forget anything. And if any of you misses our headquarters, then you will have no problem in going back there. Right, Silva? Sure. And in the same way they arrived here, they can make the trip back. Let's go back inside. Go inside. - There is nothing. - Let's see. No microphones here either. Sons of bitches! They took my family's picture. It's only material things. Don't let them see you weak. I can't. I can't. Be strong. Don't cry. I can't. Apples Chocolate. It is a tobiano (*spotted pinto horse*) - No. It's an overo. - No. Overos have white spots. It's the opposite. They're tobianos. Overos are tobianos with yellowish spots. Think about your poor mother. She came from Salto city and they didn't let her in. You have to be strong. Put your soul into it. Ok, whitish spots on yellowish skins is for tobianos. - But this one is gray. - Then I don't know. Have a look. What a nice place. Galicia. Aunt Tita wants to share with you the beautiful places she is visiting. - The Galicians fled! - Venerando and Tita are free. The mysterious inhabitants of the fig house. - Do you hear? - Yes. Look, a little chick was born from the egg. Come and see. - Really? - Yes. - Cute. - So small! No, no, don't touch him. His mother could reject him. Come here. Look at him. Let me see. How cute. - What number will they give him? - 999. 887. 863. 799. - 711. - 745. 881. 715. 790. - Are you in the barrack? - Yes, we arrived three days ago. Liliana, Sector E. - Rita. - Blanca. We only work in things that help us live better here. We don't volunteer to work for them. But days are too long. If we are keep ourselves busy time will go by faster. Some have been here for years and none of them has volunteered. - But if we collaborate a bit.. ..perhaps someone will help us.. Go back to work. You two, if I tell the officer you won't see the sun for a month. I am with you. 802! Margarita Wake up. Did you have this book last week? Yes. Yes officer. So it was you the one who underlined the book. No officer. I didn't underline it. They are looking for a excuse to put us in the punishment cell. Who else had this book in the last two weeks? Because someone must have underlined it, right? No one else. Only me, officer. And I didn't underline it. 15 days of punishment for damaging a book that is property of the penitentiary. 802, pick up your belongings! 715! What's wrong with you? I said 715. I have news for you. Today the judge has officially stated that you have lost the parental authority over your son. You will get a written notification. From now on parental authority is for the father only who is a good citizen. Anything else? For what I know, it means they are not bringing him to see you anymore. You reap what you sow. That's the way things go in this world. Good night Margarita! - Good night Margarita - Silence! Can you give me the soap? We are not deaf, 715. You don't have to shout. Silence! No singing here. You be quiet too, otherwise you won't be leaving in a year. What was that thing you left? Breadcrumbs with little seeds. In that way she does handicrafts and she realizes we are with her. Aren't you afraid of being caught and sent to that hole too? Do you think we are not in a hole? I made this for you. Thank you. Don't cry. - This is for you. - Thank you. How nice. Well, I made something for you too so you can eat something yummy before leaving. Nice. Would you like some? Have some cake. It's delicious. Beware Montevideans, here comes Gloria after 6 years of imprisonment I want to see you all outside soon, ok? -Find out about our missing companions in Argentina. -Ok. - Yes. - Yes. Don't you forget Don't forget to visit my mother so she brings news about you. Yes, of course. For Enrique. Good luck. Get in. Let's go! Or will you rather stay here? In the complete ritual of the harvest only the wheat fields of big owners are fulfilled whether they are indigenous or mestizos. Because the Indians who have small farms make their harvest as a family. And regarding the ritual they only fulfill what is essential. I will tell the story of a harvest.. What are these sons of bitches doing? That douchebag squaddie fucking bastard. Hold it one moment. Good morning dear friend. How are you? Today I am feeling a bit green. Would you like to drink some tea? I have all the afternoon to be with you. I have all the afternoon and some years to be with you. A few years go by quickly. This tea is so good. It's Mónica! Hold it! Hold it! All of you! Open the door! Mónica! Mónica! It's 702! Get out! Get out! Get out! Let's go! Let's go! Shut up! Emergency! Emergency! Get out! I'm telling you to get out, damn it! Mónica! It's 702! Emergency! 788 and 715 788 and 715! There is a special task to do and I was thinking about you two for it. You have to line that box with this flag. I want to give this gift so it has to be ready for tomorrow afternoon. We are going to see the skill for crafts you have acquired during this time. What is that box for? What? What is that box for? That's none of your business. You line this box and get it ready for tomorrow. We are not going to do it. -Are you kidding me? - No. We won't line it. You will line that box or otherwise will spend three months in the punishment cell. There is no reason for us to do it. Get rid of them. Take them away. Take them. - Let's go. Move! - Fucking assholes. All of them must go to form outside. Get out all of you. Go to form outside. I said out! - Complete lateral forming. - Let's go to form. I think your forgetting about who I am in here. Let's see.. Two volunteers to line that box with the flag. Attention Volunteers, one step forward. Volunteers, one step forward! One step forward from two of you or otherwise all of you will lose visits for three months. One step forward! Shit! Three months of punishment with no visits, mail or going out to the courtyard. And search all the books and crafts as well. As you wish, major. June 1982. - Are you sure he said 4 pm? - Yes, I am sure. You don't know how much I want to see him. Hadn't you had all those ideas in your head, you would have seen him all the time. If I had a mother who respected and supported me, I would have been able to see him more Do you have any idea about how I felt going to that horrible place? They treated us like criminals. They searched our bodies to enter. That is not a place for a child to visit. And of course, that is not place for me. You only think about yourself. They don't let me go to find him and they don't allow him to visit me either. It's only two hours every two weeks and they don't bring him to me. Would you like to drink something? Maybe he had some problem. He will call you any moment. I don't want him to call. I don't want to listen to him. I don't want his excuses. I don't believe anything from him. I want to see my son. You are being unfair. You don't know what happened. You know he will never bring him to me. What do you want? You can't be here. - I want to see my son. - Who is your son? There he is! Look at him! - Diego! - That's him. - Little Diego! - Diego! I'm your mom, Diego! Call the police! They are calling the police station. You better won't come back here. Why don't you just fuck yourself! Your ID - It expired. You will have to renew it. - It can't be. Look Here she is. You see? She is on time. We only wanted to make sure that you are behaving well and you haven't forgot about us. How often does Liliana Pereira have to show up here? - Every two weeks, Major Garone - It's Lt. Colonel. - I am sorry. Lt Colonel Garone. - Okay. From now on, she will have to show up every week. Are we okay? - Write it down there. - As you say, sir. And leave little Diego the fuck alone. Don't try to fuck up his life as well. He is safe the way he lives with his father and the people who love and respect him. Don't give yourself more trouble. If you want more trouble, you look for me directly. I hope I was clear enough. Mam, I don't have all day. Next! BORDER URUGUAY - BRAZIL ID? Your ID? ID? We.. ..ask you not to do it. You won't be harmed.. if you don't do anything. And for us, it would be a scandal that we could not assume. I ask you... we ask you... ..not to be part of that show that does not bring anything good for anyone. I'm not going to discuss this with you, Diego. Imagine.. with you. This is a decision that only belongs to me ..and to my companions, of course. And no one else. It must be clear that your return does not improve things. You won't want to discuss your decision with us. But I want you to know that I don't get why all this exhibitionism. You don't know anything about this. And when a person doesn't know anything just like it happens to you, the most decent thing to do is to be quiet. - Everyone's lawyers are confirmed, right? - Graciela, please. That was the first thing we did. How about if we organize the agenda of the statement? Go ahead. I will take note. Alphabetical order according to last names. Is that okay? It can also be alphabetical according to first names. Ok, it was always about last names. Now someone will propose we'll use numerical order. No. Vade retro. Then do you agree that Sara begins? Yes.

On October 28th 2012, before the Supreme Court of Justice we filed a complaint against a group of state agents, who during the last dictatorship, had a very high participation in the arrest and pressure on the complainants in the different prison facilities through which we passed. We consider all those accused responsible for action or omission by having committed crimes classified as crimes against humanity consisting of diverse tortures and sexual crimes that affected our physical and mental integrity and our inalienable right right to dignity. My name is Sara Bayona Gómez. I was held abducted without any communication in the 14th artillery barracks for six months. There I suffered all kinds of physical torture and I was systematically raped by major Emilio Garone Martínez by captain Gustavo Silva Taurán and by captain Ernesto Ovalle Leal. My name is Graciela Camilleri Andrade. On September 2nd 1975, when I was going out from the University I was detained by a military command and transferred to the 14th artillery barracks. There I was detained and tortured daily. One night that I was hanging Captain Silva Taurán, who today holds the rank of army general, showed up and asked the soldiers to take me down and put me in another room. There he raped me. This situation was repeated several times during my detention. And sometimes I was raped in front of other officers among whom I could recognize Lt Fernando Grosso Gallona, today, Colonel. Major Emilio Garone Martínez, today Lieutenant Colonel And captain Ernesto Ovalle Leal, today, retired captain. My name is Liliana Pereira Echeverría I was detained on July 25th 1975 by a group of soldiers wearing civil clothes commanded by captain Gustavo Silva Taurán and I was transferred to the 14th artillery barracks where I was systematically tortured over several months. On several occasions I lost consciousness and I was assisted by Dr. Ignacio Calloso Valverde. I knew him by family and he was the one who determined if the detainees could continue being tortured or that the torture had to be postponed And many times he also revived them so they continue to be tortured. Dr. Galloso Valverde threatened to bring my two-year-old son to the barracks to witness the torture his mother was subjected to. During the ten months I was in the barracks, I was repeatedly raped. And I also witnessed that a group of officers who were in that barracks, performed orgies in which they raped us detainees, men and women, that were packed there in that shed that was our prison. Among the raped I could recognize Mónica González Frías - Oh, look at this. - Thanks. - Cheers. - For life. - For life. -They didn't steal our joy. For those who are not here but remain in our memories. Who is it? Diego? Is that you? I'm coming down. - Hi. - Hi. How are you doing, miss Catalina? How are you? How are you? Oh my God - Should I give it to her? - Yeah, sure. Oh look at her. When you gave me Puffy you told me to hide it well so no one would take it from me. And I hid it so well that I did not find it until recently. "You cannot go back because life is pushing you ahead like an unending howl unending You will fell caged You will feel lost, alone perhaps wishing you'd never been born never been born But always remember what I wrote one day thinking of you thinking of you as I'm thinking now Life is beautiful, you'll see despite its sorrow you will have friends, you will have love you will have friends A man alone, a woman one without the other are dust, are nothing are nothing Therefore you should always remember what I wrote one day thinking of you thinking of you as I'm thinking now Never give in, never stray never say by the side of the road I can't go on, I'll stay here I'll stay here life is beautiful, you'll see despite its sorrow you will have friends, you will have love you will have friends And always, always remember what I wrote one day thinking of you thinking of you as I'm thinking now
