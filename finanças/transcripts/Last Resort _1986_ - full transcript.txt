(upbeat jazz music) - Jerry. Jerry! What are you saying, that you're not buying our chairs anymore? Look Jerry, I know you're our biggest customer, but we still can't give the stuff to you. If you're buying chairs at that price they're dangerous chairs, Jerry! They'll break. They'll break. People will sit on them, and they'll break. Not maybe very fat people, definitely very fat people. Look, you're very fat. Would you sit on that chair? That's a question, Jerry. That's not an insult. Jerry, I'm not angry. I just asked you a question. You are very fat. Merry Christmas to you too, Jerry. - Merry Christmas, Mr. Lollar. - Merry Christmas. Connie. I just lost the Parkhurst account. - Stop! - They beat our price by buying cheap, dangerous chairs. - Stop! - I better tell Mr. Emerson. - Stop! - The sofa beds from Dayton are gonna be a month late. Should I wait 'til after the first to tell him? - Wait 'til Easter. You're strained and you're stressed. You don't need the yelling. Let it go. - Merry Christmas, Mr. Lollar. - Merry Christmas, Fred. - It's Ed. - Ed, Merry Christmas, Ed. - Mrs. Lollar's on the phone. - Yeah. - He'll be right there, darling. How are the kids? Good. Everything's beautiful. Bye bye, doll. - Connie, have you seen Mr. Lollar? - No. - Hi honey, how you doing? Oh, I'm sorry. Put some butter on it or some ice. Have we got any scotch at home? - Lollar! - Hold on one second, honey. - Lollar! Lollar? Lollar! - I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine. I'm on my way home. I've got my ear muffs. Honey, let me ask you something. If you say to somebody, "You're very fat," could that be a description, or would that have to be an insult? It would, oh. I'll explain it to you later. Thanks, see you soon. (gentle jazz music) - Club Sand? That's a sex club. - No, no, no, it's not. Some of them are, but some are for families. This is for families. - Geroge. - Daddy, I've got a date with Larry on New Year's. I can't go! - Larry's a fag. - He is not, shut up. - Bobby, Jessie, you'll kill each other. Then you'll be so sorry. - Stay off of me! - Leave me alone for five seconds, you're driving me crazy. Daddy! - Bobby! - What am I supposed to do? Sit here and watch some geek fag try and use my sister to clean up his spit balls. - Oh, shut up you dweeb. - Jerk. - Quit it! Daddy, would you tell the mistake to leave me alone? Come here. - You're gonna give me a hernia! - Jessie honey, you'll have plenty of time to date when you're older. How often do you get a chance to go to an island? Oh, Jessie. Brad, Brad! Where's Brad? Brad, are you gonna join us? - Oh honey, Brad ate earlier. - Brad, it'd be nice to see you every so often. Brad, it's Christmas Eve. Brad? - He's trying to find himself. - [Bobby] He found himself in the bathroom about a year ago. - Bobby. - Hey, this place looks really great. There's a little mini camp for me. - It's gonna be fantastic. My whole family around me for an entire week. It's gonna be just great. - Yeah. - It will be, it will be, I'm telling you. It's gonna be the vacation of a lifetime. (all screaming) (bizarre electronic music) - Sorry folks, that was an air pocket. - It was an air pocket. It was an air pocket. - Oh yeah. Get those all the time on these routes. - I'm George Lollar. - Walter Ambrose. - How you doing? This is my wife, Sheila. - Hi! - Hello. - You been to Club Sand before? - Oh sure, all over the world. - Do you enjoy them? - They're the best. - The best. - You're a photographer? - No, I just like to videotape while I screw. (lively tropical music) (whistle blows) - [Bobby] What's going on? - [George] What's going on? - [Man] You're late for the bus! - We're late for the bus. (all bickering) Come on, come on, we're late for the bus! (whistle blows) - I never saw a bus like that before. - You'll see lots of stuff down here you've never seen before. - Come on, little boy. - Why are there so many soldiers? (guide speaking foreign language) What's going on? What language is that? - Spanish. - Well, what does that mean in English? I don't speak Spanish. (speaking foreign language) What is it? All right, I just don't speak- I don't speak Spanish! Just say what is it you want us to do. All right! (crowd applauds) (speaking foreign language) - Welcome to Club Sand! (crowd cheers) My name is Curt. I am chief of the village. (speaking foreign language) Thank you. And now, if you will bring your watches and wallets up to the stage for safekeeping, you will never see them again! (crowd laughs) No, but seriously. Here at Club Sand, we watch over. There are no locks on the doors. We are a free and open society, so relax, enjoy yourself, have a cocktail, or six or seven cocktails. (crowd laughs) And now, room assignments! - I'm Pino, come with me. All right, let's see. Phil and Dorothy Cocoran, you're here in cabin number E together. - Ah, E for excellence. (both laugh) - Why do we have to carry our own bags? - We are all free here. This is Club Sand. Don't worry, my name is Pino. Okay, here we have Robert and... Wait a minute, no. Brad Lollar and Lester Gabriel. - He has a roommate? - Yes, he has a roommate. We all have roommates here at Club Sand, so don't worry. Follow me, my name is Pino. - Bye, Brad. - Robert and Jessica Lollar. - Get a good wash up, kids. - Yes, and after you get a good wash up if there's anything you need at all you can call me and my name is Pino. Pino. - Pino? - Pino. George and Sheila Lollar, you're here together, and for you Mr. Walter Ambrose, you're here. - How come he gets his own room? - Well, he paid extra. - I didn't know you could pay extra. - You can always pay extra to Pino. (Pino cheers) - What's that "whoo"? (door creaks) (clattering) - Honey, be careful. (Sheila sighs) George. - What? - George. - It's... It's... It's a different way to think about living. It's primitive. We're gonna be living like natives. Look, it's a skylight. Oh, I thought it was... But look, you know, you get a... you know. There's no phones, no television, no... - There's nothing. There's nothing. Nothing. - All right, take it easy honey. - I was afraid it was gonna be a sex club. Who would have sex here? - Honey, people have sex anywhere, believe me. I'll put the beds together. (clattering) - What was that? - [Bobby] It's okay, mom. We just knocked over a lamp. - Oh well be careful, honey. I'm having a conversation through a wall. - [Bobby] Dad, can we go home? - Wash up, Bobby. See, okay? - Well gosh, George, it's just fabulous. - I mean, dad makes a decent living, doesn't he? - Sheila, give the place a chance! - George, this place is a disaster. Let's get out of here and check into a real hotel. - [Bobby] Mom's right, dad! - She is not, Bobby. - [Bobby] This place is a crummy hole-in-the-wall. - It is not, Bobby. Give the place a chance. - We can't even have a fight. - Look, I think we're doing beautifully. You're always asking me to show spirit. All right, now show some Lollar family spirit god damn it. Look, we're just tired, we're irritable. Let's take a shower, relax, and talk about this sensibly, okay? Come on. - Okay. George, we're not being punished for something, are we? - I mean, not that I'm aware of. (water dripping) - George, the water stopped. There's no water. - Oh honey, I'm sorry. I'll take care of it. (Sheila gasps) - The water's rusted. - What? (George yells) (crashing) - Honey, what happened? - Nothing, nothing. When everybody takes their showers at once, the water goes out. What happened to you? - The water's rusted, honey. What was the crash? - I'll get some help here. The crash was- (Sheila screams) - Oh, hi. (Sheila screams) - Get the fuck out of here! - Hey, we're all here to be free, right? - Get the fuck out or I'll kill you!

You know, perhaps if you felt the significance of these words, like we all do, you might appreciate it a little bit more. Listen to these words. Step by step we're going to make it. Hey listen, everybody. Wrap your arms around yourself right now. Now I want you to turn. Hug a stranger too. Go on, hug a stranger, and make our dreams come true! Everybody, get together! - Would you like a drink? - You think I'm gonna do this sober? - What would you like? - I don't know, get those red things. Maybe that's how people get through this. - All right. - Would you like to dance? - Oh, no thank you. - You look fantastic. - Thank you. - And, her dress would constantly pull it out. And, he said, "Well, how'd you get the other one?" She said, "I thought you wanted it there, so I put it back." (both laugh) - Excuse me, excuse me. - Hey, George! Did you get something to eat yet? (Phil laughs) - Alcohol, please give it to me narrow and straight, please. - Hey, so anyway- - Bobby! Are you crazy? Don't you want to grow? - Of course I want to grow. I just felt like a smoke. - Go to bed. It's way past your bedtime. - They don't have bedtimes at Club Sand, dad. - Bobby! - Okay. At least I'm not a fag. - Bobby, don't use that word. Nobody likes it. - Okay, at least I'm not a homosexual. - Congratulations. Anyway, we don't know what you are. - See you later, dad. - Two red fruit cocktails. Two- Two red fruit cocktails. (speaking foreign language) I don't speak... Two red fruit cocktails. - Yeah. - Oh, two fruit cocktails. Red. - Right. - Do you have tokens? - What? - Tokens? - Tokens? - Do you speak English? - That's what I'm speaking, English. - What? - Can I buy them with dollars? - Oh, god. - What? - You Americans bore me. - Why? - Everybody in the world does not use your dollar system, or didn't you know that? - Why not? - What? - Give me... Give me $20 worth of tokens. - Tokens! Tokens. - Tokens! - Hold out your damn hand. - I was gonna hold out my hands. Take it easy. I can get fairly rough if I have to. - I'm sure. Five, 10, 20. - All right, two red fruit cocktails. - You'll have to wait your damn turn. (jazzy dance music) - Would you like to dance? (both laugh) - No, thanks, but no thanks. - My name is Veroneeka. I'm a counselor here. - Yes, I saw you dancing. - Yes? (Veroneeka laughs) - I'm George. - Hello, George. - Hello. - Would you like to smoke some dope? - I... I... I... What, pot? - No, hash. It's really great shit. You'll think everything is fantastic. - I can't. I'm with my wife. I can't really, you know... - Oh, where is she? - She's outside. - Oh, that's too bad. (both laugh) Well, if you change your mind later on in the week anytime you want you can fuck my brains out. Okay? Au revoir. - All right, two red, one green, and two blue. It doesn't include a tip. - Good. (speaking foreign language) - I heard that. (speaking foreign language) - What? - What? - Forget it. (upbeat dance music) - Hey! Jessica, stop that! - [Man] Hey, watch it. - I spilled the drinks. - Hey, you're a real classy guy, George. - You really are, Georgie! - You see what Jessica's doing with that guy? - They call it dancing, George. - What's under there, George? (both laugh) - Let's get out of here. Goodnight, goodnight. Goodnight. Excuse us, excuse us, excuse us. Whoa. Just loose. Want to make love? - No. - Yeah, it's... That's okay. - Well, it's a vacation. Yeah, we really should. - All right. (distant moaning) - [Neighbor] Oh Walter, oh my god. Oh, Walter. Oh, yeah. Walter. - I'm a little tired. - I love you. - I love you. - [Bobby] And, I love both of you. - Goodnight, Bobby. - Goodnight, Bobby. (distant moaning) - [Neighbor] You're the king! (whistle blows) - Wake up, it's aerobics time! Come on, dudes and chicks! Put a little boogie in it! - Get the hell out of here! - See you later! - What time is it? - [Bobby] It's 5:00am, dad! - Jesus Christ! We missed breakfast. Now we know what time breakfast is served. - [Bobby] I'm starving. - They'll feed you in your mini camp. - I don't want to go to the mini camp. - You liked it in the brochure. - That brochure, you still buy that brochure? I can't believe you sometimes. - Sometimes you have to learn to adjust to things, Bobby. - How can you do this to me? I'm your only son who talks to you. - They're gonna take you water skiing and horseback riding. - These are kids! - It'll do you good to spend some time with kids your own age. - Hey, there's Brad. Brad, where you going? - There's a nude beach! - Nude beach? We can't let him go to a nude beach. - Why not? - We can't let him be naked in front of a lot of strangers. They could be perverts. - Brad won't go naked. - I won't go naked either! I'd like to get a look at that nude beach or those perverts. - Now bobby, behave yourself! All I've heard are complaints since we got here. Let's see some of that Bobby Lollar spirit now, come on. - Don't do this to me! Don't leave me here. I beg you, please. Let me go to the nude beach! Please, I beg you. - I feel bad if he really doesn't want to be there. - Oh, he's all right. Bobby's a survivor. - Are we? Nude beach. (dramatic music) - Hey, you sit down. When the hand goes up, the mouth goes shut. Come on, come on, come on, come on. Everyone, over there, come on, come on, come on. Get over there, get over there. Go, go, go, go, go. (speaking foreign language) - Oh, two folks on a bummer. - You know what they need? Club Sand special blend. - Club Sand special blend. (both laugh) Hello, take some. - Madam, for you. Hello. - No, no, no way. That's marijuana, isn't it? No, no, no, no. - Yes, and good shit. - No, no, we don't smoke. It's illegal. - Illegal? You kill me! - Illegal, funny. - No, no, no, we don't smoke. We'll get rid of it. We'll put it out, it's illegal. What are you doing? It's 10 o'clock in the morning. - It's a vacation, George. Come on, let's go over and sit down. - Look, hand me that. Don't admit in front of everybody that we smoke dope. - George, nobody gives a damn what anybody does around here. I mean, look around you. (George coughs) - Nobody gives a damn? Nobody gives a damn? All of a sudden they're laughing, and then somebody comes and taps you on the shoulder and says, "Hey, you're under arrest." Nobody gives a damn. Give me a hit of that. (George coughs) It's good, it's good. We'll be all right, won't we? I mean, I didn't make a terrible mistake bringing us here, did I? - Let me let this grass sit a little before I answer that, George. (George coughs) - Because, you know, I feel terrible. I love you and the kids so much, you know. - Oh George, you're stoned already. - I am? (Sheila laughs) I'm very hungry. - Me too. - Me too. You said me too and then I said me too. We both said me too. (both laugh) I feel very sexy. - Me too. - Why don't I go get us some food, and you go back to the room, and then we'll have a big, sex picnic party luncheon thing? - I'll come with you. - No, no, you go back to the room and do all that stuff you do. - What stuff do I do? - You know. - I forget. - You know. - No. - What were we talking about? We're talking about, we were just talking about something. - Yeah, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know, come on. Ah, I perfume my breasts! - What? - The thing, that's the thing I do. I put perfume on my breasts. - Oh, yeah. All right, put your voice down a little bit there. Okay, so I'll meet you back in the room in five minutes. I'll get the food, I'll meet you back there in five. - George, how're you gonna get the food? You know, they don't serve here in-between meals. - Hey, they don't call me George Lollar for nothing. - You're the greatest. - We'll be all right down here, won't we? - Well, I wouldn't go straight to all right, but... - Yeah. Okay, see you soon. - See you soon.

Look at that, look at that it's just- I'm so sorry, I can't. Thanks a lot, thanks a lot. Oh, what? - Oh George. George, this is Manuelo. I'm just getting a massage. - I need to talk to you. - Hello, George. - Hello, Maneul. I need to- - Manuelo. - Manuelo? - Maneulo. - Maneulo. I need to talk to you. I need to talk to you right away. - Oh god, George. We were really just getting into this. - Do it another time, really. Manuelo, look excuse me. Do it later, okay? - Of course. You can call me later and we can resume. - Good, thanks a lot. Thank you. Sheila- - Nice to have met you, George. - Yeah. Nice to have met you, Manuelo. Okay good, thanks a lot, thank you. What the hell's going on? - What? - What the hell have you got on under there? - Nothing. - Nothing? - What's the problem, honey? I was waiting for you, I decided to get a massage. - What's the problem? The problem is that you're a married woman naked with nothing on with a guy named Manuelo. - Manuelo- - Don't do that! Stop that! - George, calm down honey. - I got lost in the woods. I got lost. I ran into a group of guerrillas in the woods! - What, animals? - Not animals, guerrillas! Rebels! - What were they doing? - Eating! - [Sheila] Eating what? - Eating... chicken! - Why didn't you get us some chicken, George? - Why didn't I get us some chicken? They had guns! What the hell's going on down here. I can't believe you were naked with that Manuelo. (Sheila laughs) - You're stoned. You're paranoid, honey. Everything's threat to you. You're acting like Maneulo was trying to seduce me. - Why do you say that? I didn't say that. - Honey, do you still feel sexy? - Sexy? - Yeah, do you? - I always feel a little sexy. - Well, I'm naked. - They were very hairy guys, very scary, hairy guys. Guerrillas. - They were probably native soldiers. - [George] Soldiers? - Yeah. - Soldiers. - George, why don't you come under the sheet with me? Come on. - You're right. Yeah, but if they were soldiers- I told them I was looking for some food. Why wouldn't they have given me food? Maybe they were just stingy. Maybe they had a certain amount of food and they wanted to keep it. They could have been just stingy, stingy soldiers. I can't believe that you were naked with that Manuelo. I mean the guy is at his sexual peak. - Yeah, and I'm at my sexual peak, George. - Yeah, okay. I'm getting in there. Maybe you're right. Maybe it's the grass, I don't know. I do feel... Oh god, paranoid. Maybe it is the grass, I don't know. Soldiers, they didn't... I don't know. (distant moaning) - [Neighbor] Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, Walter. Oh god, you're the king! - Shut up! (dramatic music) - Okay kiddies, now I'm going to listen to some of my favorite tunes, and I don't like to be disturbed. I want everyone silent like little mice. If I hear anyone talking, I really won't like it. (pop music) - Psst. Have you ever seen anybody do it? - No, to be honest with you I haven't. - Well, that's what Club Sands are all about. - Who are you? - My name's Carlos. - Bobby. - I'm gonna show you some stuff that's gonna blow your mind. - Well, all right! (tropical music) - Frisbee, monsieur? - No. - Two green tokens. - Oh George, maybe we should play Frisbee. - No, no, we're just gonna sit on the beach, thanks. (whistle blows) - Two for the beach! - What's the barbed wire and the barricades for? (speaking foreign language) What? Look, I don't speak, you know. - What? - Look, you understand me. What's the barbed wire for, the barricade? - What? - The barbed wire, the barricade! - What? - Hello. May I interest you in some aerobics? - No, we're just gonna sit in the beach chairs. - What's your body like under that shirt? - My body's fine under that shirt. - Excuse me, what's this barbed wire here? - Oh, a nod to Gary Cooper. - Gary Cooper? - Gary Cooper. - What? - Would you like some towels, some oil, some lotion, something? - Yes. - No, no, no. - No, we do need towels. - Two red, two blue, two green, one yellow token please. - What's the barbed wire, the barricade for? (speaking foreign language) - Trust me! - Trust you about what? About what? - I don't know. - [George] It doesn't bother you that we're surrounded by barbed wire and soldiers? - Well, you know honey, nobody else seems bothered by it. I don't think we should let it get to us. (Pino cheers) - Monsieur, look at this. I can interest you in extremely macho French bathing suit? One size fits all. Guaranteed to make your body look like this. - Well, it's hard to tell under these tent of clothes, but my body does look exactly like that. - Oh, well. If lying makes you happy, hey. Oh, you're going to sit in the chairs. Very good, merci. (speaking foreign language) Red for the woman and four green for the man. - What, it costs money to sit in the chairs? And, it costs more for the man than the woman? (speaking foreign language) Why do you always answer in a foreign language whenever I say anything to him? (Pino cheers) First of all, I keep my shirt on because I don't want to get a burn, not because I'm trying to hide what's under there. I mean, that's what's under there. Big deal. - I know. - No, no, he talks to me like... I mean, they don't mean anything by it, but it's hard to relax when people attack your body- - You've got a great body. - Well, you should have said something then. - I couldn't get a- - It would have been helpful. - I couldn't get a word in edgewise. Just relax, honey. - I can relax about the barbed wire, believe me. I can handle the barbed wire, but I don't like to deal with barbed wire and soldiers with bayonets and attacks at what's under your shirt. - Look, look- - It's right here, it looks great! That's all, I'm all right, I'm all right. - Just relax, honey, really relax. Take a deep breath. Look at this, this is so beautiful. I mean, really. This is nice. - You can get away with stuff in the water you could never get away with in a restaurant, I'll tell you that right now. God, I hate my job. It's just stress on stress on stress. You can get away with stuff with suntan lotion you could never get away with in the water. There's legit suntan lotion stuff and there's legit water stuff. It's one problem after another, one problem after another. What does it all mean? - Oh honey, it means you can have a good life. It means you can send your kids to college, live in a nice house, take vacations, have nervous breakdowns on them. - Hey, that's Jessica!
