Travis: What if there was no reason? What if she just invited you? Josh: People don't just invite you for no reason. Josh: They invite you cause you either have something they need or you're useful. Travis: That's not true. Aeron invited me just cause she wanted to. Travis: Aeron doesn't use people like that. Josh: Oh, then who's idea was it to invite Robert for his gear? Travis: That was my idea. Travis: When Aeron invited me to go camping she asked if I had any tents and I said no but I knew where we could g..ah, shit! Josh: [LAUGHS] Josh: You got used man.

Aeron: I mean, it feels like I'm awake but at the same time I don't know. Amber: That's kind of weird. Aeron: Lil' bit. Amber: [LAUGHS] Aeron: So, this place is completely secluded? Like, no other cabins around? Amber: Not within screaming distance. Aeron: And it's your family's land? Amber: It's my uncle's. He likes to go hunting and fishing. Amber: But he doesn't really use it that much so he rents it out and I get to use it whenever I want. Aeron: So, do you use it often? Amber: I used to come up here a lot when I was younger but I haven't been up here in years. Aeron: Well, thanks for letting me invite everyone. I know you don't really know them but they're cool people. Amber: It's cool. I trust your taste in friends. Aeron: So, what do you think of Josh? Amber: Except that one. Aeron: Okay, what's the real reason you hate him? Amber: Honestly, I think he's trash and I don't see how you guys even hang out with him. Aeron: Come on, now. He's not trash. He just has an aggressive personality. Aeron: You just gotta get to know him. Amber: I don't believe that but to each their own. Eric: Dude, you're fucking crazy. Eric: There's no way in hell that Superman could be Hulk. There's no way. That would never fucking happen in a million fuckin' years. Robert: Nah, hold up dude. I really think that, okay, I think Superman can definitely beat the Hulk. Okay? Robert: He's got the whole rack of superpowers man. He's got the not just super-strength, he's got the ice breath. Robert: He's got the heat vision, he's got like super strength and speed. You know, he can fly. Robert: He could just pick Hulk up, fly through space and fly all the way to the Sun and just drop Hulk into the Sun, dude. Eric: Dude, dude. You're fucking stupid. Eric: Okay, look. The Hulk is just as strong as Superman, if not stronger. Eric: And if he flies to the Sun, it would take him who knows how fucking long, even with the speed, and Hulk would break out. Eric: And there's no fucking way that he would win because doomsday killed Superman and doomsday and Hulk are kind of similar so. Eric: Your arguments fucking flawed man. Eric: The fucking Hulk would whoop his ass. Eric: End of fucking conversation. Robert: Nah, man, I mean, I...you know what? Robert: Okay. Okay, umm. Robert: To be continued. Josh, dude. Could you umm, pull over dude? I gotta use the organic latrine. Eric: Let this dumbass out. Robert: If you know what I mean. Josh: Can't it fucking wait, dude. We're almost there. Robert: No can do maestro. I got an unusually small bladder. Josh: It's a shame you don't have a smaller fucking mouth. Robert: As a matter of fact... Josh: Just fucking go. Get the fuck out of the truck. Eric: Go man! Josh: Go! Robert: ...not umm, proportionate, uh. [DOOR CLOSES] Josh: Is he gone? Robert: Wait! [FOOTSTEPS RUNNING] Eric: Thank you, God. Josh: Eh, he'll find his fucking way. Robert: [SIGH] Robert: Well. Robert: It appears that Hulk has defeated Superman after all. Robert: But that sir, was not a fair fight. Robert: [SIGH] Robert: Just have to call my brother up. Robert: Hey, bro. Hello? Paul: What do you want, Robert? Robert: Dude, uh, I need a favor. Paul: [SIGH] And what is that? Robert: Uh, can you come get me? Paul: What? Robert: I... Paul: No, I'm not coming to pick you up. Robert: Come on, dude. Paul: I thought you said you were going camping or something? Robert: Yeah, dude, I still am. I just need you to come pick me up. Paul: [LAUGHS] You got left again, didn't you? Robert: Shut up, dude. It's not like last time. Paul: Man, you are such a loser. Robert: No, I'm not! Paul: I told you nobody wanted to hear that bullshit about Bigfoot. Robert: Look, dude... Paul: Only an idiot goes into the forest looking for a fictional creature. Robert: Fictional? Dude, you play Pokemon Go. That's literally what you do all the time. Paul: Well, at least I don't get left on the side of the road because no one can stand to be around me. Robert: Look dude, are you coming to get me or not? Paul: Hmm... Paul: Not? Robert: Uh. Dude! Robert: Try something else. Robert: Call dad. Robert's Dad: Hey Robbie. Robert: Hey Dad, can you pick me up? Robert's Dad: Come pick you up? Robert: Yeah? Robert's Dad: Why? Where are you? Robert: I'm on the side of the road. Robert's Dad: Side of the road? Well, what the hell are you doing there? Robert: I got left. Robert's Dad: Left? Robbie, not again. Robert's Dad: What are you doing to these people? Robert: I didn't do anything. Robert's Dad: People don't leave someone on the side of the road for no reason Rob. Robert: That's what happened. Robert's Dad: Well, I'm sorry but I can't come get you, son. Robert: Why not? Robert's Dad: Robbie, I'm afraid if I keep picking you up off the side of the road Robert's Dad: that's where you'll keep ending up. Robert's Dad: Sorry, son. Maybe you'll learn from this experience. Robert: Wait. Robert: But dad. Robert: Aww. [Suspenseful music] Robert: [SIGH] Robert: Well, I guess I couldn't ask for a nicer late afternoon to go on a nice long walk. Robert: Who the fuck am I kidding man? This shit sucks. Robert: Man. [TRUCK APPROACHING] Robert: If Hulk was walk beside me man, his green ass would just be walking. I wish I could fly like Superman. Robert: Superman's definitely better. Robert: Huh? [ENGINE SHUTS OFF] [DOOR SLAMS] Robert: Uh, hi. Hello. Robert: Umm. Uh, do you need some assistance? I'm fine. I...I...I don't Robert: That's a...that that that's pretty cool mask. Are you a nurse? Robert: [LAUGH] Hopefully you don't want to get a Children's Hospital. Robert: [NERVOUS LAUGH] Robert: Whoa, whoa! Now, I know most gentlemen aren't intimidated by a strong female Robert: especially an attractive one.

I wouldn't go anywhere near you balls. Travis: Aww, she's bashful. Group: [LAUGHS] Travis: Don't worry, girl. You know you give the best handjob. Travis: Besides, it looks huge in those little hands. Eric: You do realize you're saying you would let a guy jerk you off, right? Travis: I'm just saying. With enough alcohol and some poor lighting, you could pass for seventeen year old girl. Group: [LAUGHS] Josh: You know, he does have a point. Travis: What? Travis: She told me she was 18! Josh: So Aeron, why didn't you drink? I know you're no Demi Mooreing it down there, are you? Aeron: I don't want to play right now. Can we do something else? Travis: I got a story to tell. Eric: No one wants to hear your fucking stupid ghost stories, Travis. Travis: No. It's not bullshit, man. I read it on Facebook so you know it's true. Travis: Apparently, some mental hospital around here had some patient escape. Eric: So what? An old man in a wheel chair broke out of a hospital. Watch the fuck out! Travis: No, it was a woman. Travis: She got committed years ago for like killing a couple people or something like that Travis: and a couple months ago she just flipped the fuck out and killed two orderlies. Andrea: Oh my God. Seriously? Travis: Yeah, I mean the article didn't say much. Travis: But I read into the comments. Apparently, they didn't even know what happened until the next day. Travis: All they found was her eye. Eric: Dude, you're completely full of shit. That's the dumbest story I've ever heard. Aeron: Can we change the subject? Travis: Look, I'm just saying. It's a true story. Josh: It sounds like a load of bullshit to me, Travis. But I got a real story for you. Josh: It's about a guy who wears one glove. Josh: He's got a really fucked face and he likes to chase around little children. Amber: Freddy Krueger? Josh: Fuck no, I'm talking about Michael Jackson. That motherfucker's scary as shit. Eric: [LAUGHS] Right. Fuck Travis, you're a terrible liar. Travis: Look, I'm just trying to warn you guys. Okay? Travis: One of those lunatics escaped and now there's a bloodthirsty killer on the loose. Aeron: You know, you're a dick, Travis. You should call people stuff like that. Travis: What the fuck did I say? Andrea: Aeron's brother killed himself. Travis: I didn't know what I was saying was gonna piss anybody off. [DOOR SLAMS] Josh: What the fuck does Moe have to do with Travis's lame ass story and Aeron getting upset in the first place? Travis: Dude, I swear I'm not making this shit up. Travis: True story. Andrea: Probably the part where you called them lunatics. Andrea: That was pretty messed up. You don't know who has family with mental health issues. Josh: Who gives a shit, anyway? I'm tired of tiptoeing around everybody's fucking feelings. Josh: Call it what it is. If they don't like it, they can eat a bowl of fucking dicks. Josh: Just make sure you save some for Amber. Eric: [LAUGHS] Travis: No, I...I see her point. Probably shouldn't have said anything. Travis: Probably wasn't cool. Josh: Travis, will you shut the fuck up and grow a pair for once? Eric: [SNICKERS] Travis: Alright. I'm gonna go for a walk. Give Aeron some time to cool off. Travis: If I find Robert'ss dumb ass out there I'll send him back to the cabin.

[BOTTLES CLINK] [RAINING] Amber: So...you gonna tell me what that was about? Aeron: Nothing, I just don't like hearing people say stuff like that. Not everyone with a mental issue is a monster. Amber: Do you know somebody with a mental issue? Aeron: Sometimes I just feel responsible for what happened. Amber: What do you mean? Josh: Hey Aeron, are you okay? Look, I'm sorry about what Travis said. Josh: I told him he needs to put a filter on it next time. Aeron: Yeah, I'm fine. We were just getting ready to come back in. Josh: Well, good.

Josh: Look, what is it? You know I'm busy right now. Andrea: Sorry Josh. I just wanted to see if you wanted to take some of this X with me, you see? Andrea: And I can repay your for it. Josh: I'm gonna take a raincheck on that. Josh: But maybe Eric will be interested. Andrea: You know she's not into you, right? Josh: Look, if you say anything about us I will fucking end you, bitch. Josh: Sorry about that. Josh: What the fuck is this? Aeron: What's wrong? Josh: I'm going for two fucking seconds and the bitch jumps in my grave? Amber: I didn't know we had assigned seats. Josh: This is bullshit. You need to get the fuck up before I jerk you up. Amber: I fucking dare you! Aeron: Josh! Josh: Bitch, I will lay you the fuck out and not think twice about it. Aeron: Josh, what's your problem? Amber: His problem is he's trying to fuck you. Amber: That's his problem. Josh: You fucking cunt! Aeron: Josh, what the hell is wrong with you? Amber: Takes a real piece of shit to put his hands on a woman. Josh: You two fucking cunts are in this together, aren't you? Aeron: What the hell are you talking about? Josh: They know. They've been trying to fuck shit up for me for this whole weekend Josh: and I'm fucking sick of it. Aeron: If you're referring to you and Andrea, I already know. Aeron: She told me awhile ago and I told her she should stop Aeron: because she's with Travis. Josh: What about you and me? Aeron: You're more like a brother to me. Josh: Your brother? Josh: Are you fucking kidding me? I'm not your fucking brother. Aeron: Yeah, but you're the closest thing I have left to him. Josh: We were friends, that doesn't make me him. Josh: So why do I get stuck in the friend zone just because your brother offed himself? Amber: Josh, that's enough. Aeron: He was high. He wouldn't have done it if he wasn't. Josh: Oh, I see you still blame me for him doing drugs, don't you? Aeron: Did I say that? No. Just stop! Josh: Look, I've been doing drugs a lot longer than he has and I didn't off myself. Josh: He was just fucking weak. Josh: Oh, pull up a chair, enjoy the show. You can shit on me next. Aeron: Just stop. Josh: Look Josh: He swallowed a fucking bullet because he hated his life. The drugs were just here to cushion the blow. Aeron: I can't do this. Excuse me. [DOOR SLAMS] Amber: You sorry son of a bitch! Josh: Fuck her. She knew what this was. Amber: Yeah and now she knows who you are. Josh: Good. I sure as hell wasn't trying to hide it. Josh: Now, you can get the fuck out of my face, you dyke bitch. Eric: Whoa Josh. Come on, man. Josh: Fuck you, man. Moe's dead. That's not my problem. Josh: I'm over it. Amber: Get the fuck out of here. Josh: Fuck you. You wanna be a thigh diver with her in the bedroom, go for it.
