That is cold. Do you feel that? It's Daddy. Daddy's in there. Daddy's in there. Stand on those feet. Say, "dad, look. I can stand." That's Daddy. I know some people have called Section 60... the saddest acre in America... because of all of the people from Iraq who are buried here. And Afghanistan too. I would say it's also probably one of the most honorable places... in America. - You want to see my baby? - Absolutely. That's my son, Eric. He was 20 years old. Shot by a sniper. You know, in the neck and it was instant. He was gone. And we miss him horribly. I do that all the time. There's something about... As soon as I come, I... I just do that. It's very comforting to just rub your hand along. Absolutely. It's almost like rubbing their face, you know? Are you leaving? Or can we go say hi to Bob? Sure, let's go say hi to Bob. - I'm coming back here anyhow. - Take care of your buddies. Oh, my God. There's five... five more rows here. - Yeah. - You know? In just two short years. Those flowers are beautiful. He turned 21 in February. He was killed then in June. And that's the day before Eric's birthday. My baby. I love you. Stopping to say hello. Looking for Mrs. Duckworth? Sonia. Sonia? Sonia. Okay. Hi, Sonia. I'm Chaplain Will Horton. I'm going to be the chaplain for the funeral this morning. My condolences to you and your family as you're going through this process. Step. Today, we come to lay to rest a great patriot. Staff Sergeant Eric Thomas Duckworth who's honorably served our nation... going to Iraq and laying his life on the line... in the preservation of our freedoms. He didn't like flowers. He didn't like flowers. But, I told him he didn't have no other choice. Mama in control, when he didn't like flowers. This was the last picture he took. And he was just 24. He called around 4 o'clock in the morning. And he asked me what I was doing. I said, "Andy, you see the different in time? I'm sleeping." He said, "Yeah, mama. I forgot." Then he said, "Okay, I going to go grab something to look for lunch. And I just call you to tell you that I love you and God bless you." And that's why they, when come and let me know, I couldn't believe it. I said, "I talked to him." So, I guess that was a goodbye for gone. Thank you so much. Say, "You're welcome." You got a little helper or something. You know my... my wedding flowers were daisies, Gerber daises? Were they really? We have to ask her if it's okay if you do it. You can if you like. His is right... this one right here. I don't mind at all. Put them right there. Thank you. I'm just going to say goodbye to him. - Okay, bye-bye. - All right. Bye-bye. Chris and I are going to share a beer. He was my brother-in-law and... you know, young guy. He's 22. And so, you know, he was just recently really experiencing beer. He loved the fact that he had been stationed in Germany. So, I thought, you know, an October Fest beer... would be something he would enjoy today. So, out here trying to share one with him. So, we'll open up a couple and he can have one. And I can have one. And so... Here's to... here's to you, Chris. And we'll take... we'll take it slowly. He was killed in an IED attack. My mother and my father have passed in... in the last three years. I'm quite frankly, I rarely go... to visit their gravesites. So... it must be something... unique about here. I need to catch up. I kind of had looked forward to... being able to hang out with Chris... down the road. I guess this will have to do. Yeah. There you go, Buddy. - Hi, I'm Paula. - Hi. - This is your husband? - Yes, Ma'am. Third Special Forces Group. My son was killed in Afghanistan. - So, yeah... - Do you have other children... - in the army still? Or? - No, he was my only child. He was my only child. Yeah. But, I like to tell people I... you know, I told him. You know, I didn't mind him going into the service. But, since the country was at war, you're my only kid. Why would you put yourself in harm's way? You're my only kid. He said, "Mom, you should have had more kids. That's not my problem." I'm wondering if those are, like... new cadets. Their uniforms are blank. You know what I mean? They got, like, no stripes or anything. They look like cadets cause they all look so young. Oh my goodness! Hi, how are you? Oh my goodness! This is amazing! - So good to see you. - You're making me cry. Oh my! You look so good. I hardly recognized you. - Man, it's so good to see you. - Unbelievable! Our Saturday training. We do different things. But, today, we... This is one of Justin's best friends. He's in the Navy. He's up at the Navel Academy. And I didn't know he was going to be here. I cannot believe this. This is unbelievable. - How have you been? - I've been keeping busy. I come out every week and I try to put out new pictures... and things like that. Everybody loved him. He's my best friend. He was basically a part of my family. - Such, just babies. - Just babies. - They probably... - Their hats even look too big. Listen, that's why I didn't recognize them. The hats look too big, like, you know? They've got on their father's clothing. They look just a... just too young. Just look too young. You know, I just wonder what go through their mind... you know, when they come here and see all this. Yeah. This is Maria, my fiance. She was a nurse taking care of the Iraqi civilians. Today is three months to the day when she died. July the 10th. July the 10th. I am father of Captain Humayun Khan. Humayun passed away in Ba'qubah, Iraq on June 8th, 2004. We moved to United States 25 years ago and made it our home... because of the opportunity and freedom of religion... freedom of expression. God bless. God bless everybody. Everyone here. Prayer reminds us that... we all are here with a purpose. I just miss him a lot. Especially every day in the morning, every evening. Sorry. We've come to lay to rest another great patriot. Staff Sergeant Jason Michael Buckus. Today, he is being laid to rest with great men and women. He will never be forgotten. That's it. There it is. There you go. Yeah, okay. - Who's that? - My Uncle, Aaron. Okay. That's Iraq. Most people have no clue. Can you tell them what you always used to tell Uncle Arron? - What? - About going in the army? Tell him. If you go in the army, you'll get killed. That's what she always told him. That if he went into the army, he'd have to go to war... and get killed. - He did. - Yeah, he did. He got killed. I can't believe he's under here. I don't even feel bad sitting on top of him. He used to make me walk on his back to crack his back. Even when I was fat pregnant. And I said, "I'm too fat for this." And he goes, "No, it feels good." So that's what I thought of yesterday the first thing. And I stepped on it and I thought... "You always ask me to step on your back." Yeah. I don't know about you. But, the first thing I do... when I wake up every morning is check my e-mail. He didn't write me that morning. But, I thought, "Well, I bet he just got back late... from a mission and he's tired." I didn't know. And there I was painting. - I can't believe this happened. - I hate this. I'm mad. I miss him. What a year? My 25th year. I think that's supposed to be a year your car insurance goes down. And that you fully become an adult. People say 25. And I was 25 and had Eva. And then, a month later, I closed on our house. And then, four months later, my husband was killed. And is it better that we didn't have 50 years together? I don't know how this is supposed to go. Guess we're not the only ones, you know? Everybody's heart just breaks. We're not the first and we're not going to be the last. Which sucks. Cause I would rather us be the last. Me too. I don't ever want anybody, any other wife to go through this. I don't. Maybe we should go over and see when he died. Maybe he just died. - Do you want to go see? - Could be. Do you think we can leave our stuff here? If someone steals something... From a cemetery? Really, how worse could our lives get? I know. Right? He died in 1989. It didn't look any easier for her either. That's me. That's Daddy. That's Sissy. And that's Mommy. You tell them that Daddy's a hero and he died in the war? It's a big adjustment. He was in for ten years. And so, we learned that military life. And so, it's a big adjustment coming back to the civilian world. And there's so many people who... hate the war and hate President Bush. It's hard to hear the things they say... when you feel like your husband died for his country. We got to say bye to Daddy. Yeah? Did you all sing Happy Birthday to Daddy yet? You ready? Happy Birthday to you. - Happy Birthday to you. - Happy Birthday to you. - Happy Birthday to Daddy. - Happy Birthday to Daddy. - Happy Birthday to you. - Happy Birthday to you. And how old would he have been? How old is Daddy? Thirty. Thirty years old. I just wish I could have one more conversation with him. Faith's fish died the other day and she said, "Mommy... I really miss my papa. But, I miss my fish now too. Why did he have to die and go to heaven? Will my papa have my fish?" - What do you say? - What do you say? She was in the bedroom on the computer. And she says, "Look at this." And so, I read it. And it talked about the 16 servicemen who were killed in Afghanistan. And she says, "You know what that means, don't you?" And I say, "What does it mean?" She says, "That means there are 16 mothers... who are going to be crying tonight." She did not know she was going to be one of them, though. It means this little boy of mine that was born at night... wants me to take him out for a ride in the car. Well, I would sing that song and he would fall asleep. And that's what he's doing. He's sleeping. This week is his anniversary. So, it's... it's very, very hard. Cause I feel like it's happening all over again. But, this time, I know it's going to happen. So, it's weird. It's very weird. We're connected to them. And... there's a... that part of the umbilical cord... that did not get cut. It goes with them wherever they go. And they are with us. - I do believe that. - I believe that too. One of my Gold Star meetings that I go to... one of the mothers from Vietnam. She looked at me and she said... "Lisa, the older you get, the more they become a part of you." - Really? - Yeah. And this, we're talking... it was on the eve of 40 years. And, you know, every time I hear one of them say how long it's been... I... I just tremble because I think, "Forty years." No, I can't do that. I know. I'm going to miss him for 40 years and... and then some. But, for 40 years, and plus, our love grows. Our love did not die. We have to leave by 5 pm. They close. Did they come and kick you out last week, Gina? No. They didn't. Cause as I was leaving, they were closing the gate. I think, somebody told me it was until 6 pm. That's what he do when he comes here. He stay. He sleep there. Take a nap, like, three, four hours. He's... he'll stay there. The guy that lays there. I've never seen him before. - I've never seen him before. - Yeah. The other day, I came and he was, like, there and I was worried. I was getting... I was for two hours waiting for him to wake up. - Well, you feel his pain. - That's true. - Mr. Medina, do you want some water? - Yeah. Thanks. I appreciate it. It's not some cold water. It's just, you know, something. - It's too hot in here, so... - That's all right. Thanks. - It's okay? - Yeah. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Is that his hat? - No. - That's hair. That's not even him. Is it you? It's you? - Are you going to leave it for Dad? - Probably. You'll find that at the end that we're all here... for the same reason, you know? So, if you need anything... I'm always down there at the other end. It's so hard, you know? I'm in the military too. And I just got back from Iraq in January. And he left in March. Turns out that... Major Gilbert. Right here, he was killed in Balad when I was there. And Kermit was in a helicopter crash. And I had never even realized that they were just so close to Mike. And when I went to their services, I thought, "Gosh, their families." And then I... - Now, I feel what they felt. - Absolutely. So hard. I don't know where it's coming from. It's back there. Back there. Students, we've brought you to Section 60 today. And what you've done is you've made this memorial ribbon. You've all selected soldiers and you've done research. Work on them. And you're going to locate the gravesite. So that you can go ahead and lay your puzzle piece... on your soldier's gravesite. Hi. This is a puzzle piece for you. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Michael was 19 years old. He had had his 19th birthday over in Iraq. Went off to basic training between 11th and 12th grade. And then he went to Airborne school. And then he went to ranger training. All he ever wanted to do was be in the army and be a soldier. And now, he's a soldier for God. - But, thank you. - You're welcome. This is a lot for you? It's okay. So, if you all would be so kind as to take a stone... you can leave them on the markers to let some of the families... and even the soldiers know that you were here. You're welcome. God, of all consolation... comfort us as we remember Eric on the anniversary of his death. Eric, you're up in heaven with God. And we can't wait to get there some day. But, it's not our time right now. And we miss you every day. And we love you. And we'll always miss you. And we'll never, ever, ever forget what you did or you. "I'm just trying to be a father, raise a daughter and a son" "Be a lover to their mother" "Everything to everyone" "Up and at them bright and early" "My own business in my suit" "Yeah, I'm dressed up for success from my head down to my boots" "And I will always do my duty no matter what the price" "I've counted up the cost" "I know the sacrifice" "And I don't want to die for you" "But, if dying is asking me..." "I'll bear that cross with honor cause freedom don't come free" "I'm an American soldier" "I'm an American" On this funeral, just know that there's going to be a... a lot of people out there for this. Make sure you guys are all looking sharp. Lead. Ready? Swing? Asson. Ford, go. One day, we shall see Chris again. And in that meantime, we are the ones who are challenged... to continue the work that he began, and gave everything for. Aim. Aim. It's an Iraqi freedom cigar. He sent two home... and he said when he got back, we would smoke these. I... When he died, I took one of them and cut it in half. I cut it, actually cut it in three quarters. My dad smoked a little bit of it. And I smoked one. And the other one, I put back in the container. And put in his pocket. So, he's got this in his pocket. This is it. Get back here and relax a little bit. Not surprising that I'm here by myself in Section 60 today. The next week would have been our 20th wedding anniversary. So... it's just tough all the way around. You want to stand by Uncle Aaron's tombstone? Take a picture? Trying to find Wilson. Don't have an exact grave... Right here? Christopher M. Wilson? Sergeant, US Army. March 29, 2007. This was the hardest death for me. Chris had taken a rocket to the stomach. I started having flashbacks and blackouts where I would just... I'd wake up on the floor in the bathroom... with a razor in my hand. Cuts all the way down my wrist. Every single time I dream, he's there. I... I get... I'm taken back to the time... where I was holding the dressing on his stomach... as he was bleeding out. - And... - You're standing here. How do you feel now? I'm proud. You need to take that with you when you leave. Help turn that. Okay? Wasn't your fault. They do take care of the graves nice down here. Lot of graves. And I'm sure there will be a lot more before this war is over too. That's sad. But, that's reality. That's the realistic point of it. There will be lots more. Hi, Samara. Happy Thanksgiving. I know... I know. She cried whole day yesterday. All night last night. Really, I... I would exchange my life if my life in return, he'd wake up. And I... I want to do that. Exchange. It's getting cold. How... how cold you are. Just to keep you warm a little bit, Buddy. Merry Christmas, Lou. Lou's nickname was Tank. Got him a little tank here for Christmas. Lou was my whole world, you know? I know he's in a better place. They can't shoot at him. They can't do anything to him now. He loved Christmas. He loved the wintertime and he liked to drink hot cider. And go look at Christmas lights. I would drink hot chocolate because I don't really like hot cider. And he loved to have all the lights on. Like the Christmas lights and shut off all the other lights. And watch a movie and... He just really, really loved this time of year. I don't understand. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. My husband is buried here. So, we come every... as often as we can. We... We moved here so that we could be near him. And... come out for birthdays and anniversaries... and special events and stuff. Where are you in all your candy canes? - I'm almost to the end. - Okay. Remember, no running. We're in... we're in a cemetery, okay? And no shouting. But... Merry Christmas. We're... We've got four more rows to go. And then we'll go get Daddy his pictures you colored, okay? They were so little when he died. I'm always worried that they'll forget. The baby never even met him. So... she just has our memories. The only thing she knows is this is her daddy. They're not here without you. Merry Christmas, Daddy. - Okay. - Happy New Year. And Happy New Year. Let's hope this year's better. We're bringing him a white Christmas. I want to hear him tell me he forgives me for not being there... when this happened. I'd take his place in a heartbeat. Yeah.
