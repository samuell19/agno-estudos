The Brides Of Dracula Hammer Time 1960 English. [ MALE NARRATOR ] Transylvania... land of dark forests... dread mountains, and black un-fathomed lakes. Still the home of magic and devilry... as the 19th century draws to its close. Count Dracula, monarch of all vampires... is dead. But his disciples live on... to spread the cult and corrupt the world. [ WHIP CRACKING ] Not so fast, please. Not so fast. [ HORSE NEIGHING ] Easy, there, easy! Steady, won't you? What's that thing? [ FROGS CROCKING ] [ HORSES NEIGHING ] Hang on, there. Hang on, me beauties. There's nothing to be scared of, nothing to be scared of. Mother of God, it's a corpse. I thought you was a dead one. [ GRUNTING ] What's the matter? Why have you stopped? [ COACHMAN ] Just moving this log out of the way, miss. It was right in the middle of the road. There, now. Now we can get on our way. Won't take long, miss. We'll make good time now. I promise you. Now, me beauties, let's get out of here. Come on. Get a move on. Hup, there. Hup! d [ FOLK MUSIC PLAYING ] d Good evening, miss. [ PEOPLE CHATTERING ] [ MEN LAUGHING ] [ HORSES SNUFFLING ] Welcome to The Running Boar, Fraulein. Thank you. Our bill of fare is simple, but I think you'll find it good. Hot goulash, a dish of sauerkraut, and our own red wine from the valley. Will you be eating alone or along with the rest of the passengers? Alone, if you please. You see, lam he only passenger, so I must. What? You are travelling alone? Yes, to the Academy in Badstein. It is not very much further on, is it? I've come from Paris, and I am due tomorrow at the latest. [ CHATTERING STOPS ] Look, as you're travelling alone, you'd better get back to the coach. My lads will have fresh horses between the shafts in a trice. What I mean is, you don't want him to go without you. But he won't. The coachman knows I am here. I know he does, but he'll want to get away as soon as.... [ COACHMAN ] Hey, Ho! Stop! Stop! Stop! What did I tell you? But he had no right to leave without me. You don't know what right he had or hadn't. He's gone and that's all there is to it. What can we do? Very well, I shall have to stay here the night. For the night? You can't. I've no room. But what else can I do? Johan, go around to the farm at once and ask to borrow their cart. Get along with you. Now... just you sit down here and let me fetch you something good to eat. We'll get you away tonight. We must. But.... Not having a room, you understand. [ THUNDER CLAPPING ] [ THUNDER CLAPPING ] There. This'll put some warmth into you against the journey. Yes, Johan? I've got the cart in the back. Come along, we've no time to lose. But... Johan's right. You must go. Is that the stagecoach coming back? [ THUNDER RUMBLING ] Don't open it. I must. [ BANGING ON DOOR ] Wine. [ FIRE CRACKLING ] Will you join me? Thank you, but I already... Another glass. This Tokaj is twin brother to the best in the Emperor's cellar. Rather different from that wine of the valley you were drinking. What a very wild night. Yes, isn't it? I hope you've not far to go. I am on my way to the Ladies Academy at Badstein. The Lang School? I know it well. But I thought I passed the stagecoach as I came down here. It left me here, I'm afraid. Forgive me... but I was wondering if by any chance you might be going that way? They can't put me up here, and I don't know what to do. If you'll excuse me, my husband was mistaken. We have a room if you wish. So you are going to the Lang's at Badstein? Yes. I've got my first appointment there as a student teacher. I start tomorrow, and I did not want to give a bad impression by arriving late. You needn't do that. I can't take you over tonight... but I shall see that you get there early in the morning. Meantime, you cannot stay in a poor place like this. There is nowhere else. Indeed there is. I am the Baroness Meinster. My castle is in the hills, just above the village. Please give me the pleasure of being my guest tonight. I should be more than grateful. Let us waste no more time then. Come. [ thunder rumbling ] You are very kind, madame. I'm nothing of the sort. I'm a very lonely old woman who often longs... for the company of someone with a little breeding... a rare thing in these parts. [ horses neighing ] Let me introduce myself, madame- My name is Marianne Danielle. Thank you, Mademoiselle Danielle. Greta, this young lady is staying the night with us. See that she's comfortable. We will have dinner in 10 minutes. Can you be ready by then? Yes, madame. Madame la Baronne is very kind, but I feel I am intruding most terribly. I had no idea she was expecting a guest. Nobody is expected. The Baroness always has a second place laid in case somebody should come. And I have come, haven't I? Yes. Ten minutes. Please do not keep madame waiting. [ THUNDER RUMBLING ] [ THUNDER CLAPPING ] Oh. You will see more by daylight. Madame is waiting. Greta, you said she wasn't expecting anyone... a guest, I mean. But I saw a man on the balcony below. He didn't look like a servant. I am the only servant left at Castle Meinster. I felt sure I saw a young man. Madame is waiting. Are you about ready? Almost. Aren't you having any soup? [ LOW WHIRRING ] have very little appetite. Greta tells me you thought you saw someone... on the balcony below your room. I thought I did. I thought I saw a man, a young man. But I must have been wrong. You were not wrong. You saw my son. But I thought... You thought what I wanted you to think... that I was an old woman living here alone. Now you know that I am not alone. I have a son. Please, I don't... My son is ill. I am so very sorry. His illness has destroyed my peace of mind in these last years. You may not believe it, but we have had gay times here. Balls, dinners... life. I'm sure. People used to come from all over Europe, even from Paris, to be my guests... until he ruined it all. He ruined it all? How? It hurt me too much not to be able to present my only child to my friends... to have to keep him locked up. Is he ill in his mind? I never see him myself. Greta looks after him. She's his old nurse. You never see him yourself? He has made me suffer so appallingly. He has his own rooms apart from the rest of the castle... only reached through that door. But all that is nothing. The vital thing is that you discovered his existence... and I have explained the situation. But madame, are you sure he's happy in there? Are madmen happy? Surely, something can be done. Is there no doctor? We pray for death, he and I. At least, I hope he does. The people around here think he's dead already. So I'm told, and I encourage that belief. Encourage? I see you are passing judgement on me, my child. Sleep before you pronounce sentence. I'm feeling very tired. May I say good night? Of course, madame. Good night. Thank you. And may I say... God bless you? If only he could. [ THUNDER RUMBLING ] [ FOOTSTEPS PATTERING ] [ FOOTSTEPS STOP ] No! Don't do that. Who are you? Who are you? Why have you come here? I called to you from my window. I have come to help you if I can. Help me? Have you? Come here, will you? No, don't be frightened. I want to look at you. You're very beautiful. So you have come to help me, have you? No one can do that, mademoiselle. No one can do that. I was terrified... you were going to throw yourself over the balcony. I assure you, I wasn't. I can't. Come closer. Please, come closer. You see, I.... I can't come to you. But it's inhuman. My mother thinks of me as inhuman, doesn't she? I suppose she's told you that I'm mad... that I have to be locked away like this for everybody's sake. Why shouldn't she? And why shouldn't you believe her? I don't know what to believe. You see, mademoiselle, this castle... the mountains, the dark acres of forest... even the valley below, belong to me. They are my inheritance. I am Baron Meinster. But my mother is a vicious, evil, jealous woman. She let people believe that I'm dead. She wants them to think that the castle and the grounds have devolved upon her. They might just as well have done so. I'm more than half dead already... living shut away like this as I am. You mustn't talk like that. I promise to help you. If you'll confide in me, lam sure I can. Only tell me what to do. Could you.... Could you, I wonder, find the key that fits this? Where does your mother keep it? Greta tells me it's in a locked drawer of the bureau in her bedroom. That's the room next to yours. I'll find it. Will you? There are grave risks, you know. Do you think you dare? Yes, I dare. [ window closing ] Monsieur le baron. Yes. I have found a key. [ whispering ] Good. Throw it to me. One moment. Now you must get dressed at once and meet me outside, will you? Yes. But hurry! Give me back that key. But madame, I... You have taken a key from my room. Give it back to me. Do you hear me? I assure you, madame. I have no key. You must have it. Give it to me. Give it to me! Leave me alone. You haven't taken it to my son. You little fool, you don't know what you've done. You don't know what you've done. Help me. Help me. There, there. Don't worry. She can't harm you now. You have nothing to fear. Go to your room and wait there. Mother, come here. No. No, my son. Mother. Come here. Now, Mother, come along with me. [ Greta ] He's free. He's gone. [ GRETA SOBBING ] Oh, God! [ SOBBING ] He's gone. Good heavens. God help us. He's free! He's free. Oh, God help us, he's gone. He's gone. He's free. [ GRETA WAILING ] He's gone away. Oh, God, the cunning devil. [ GRETA CONTINUES WAILING ] Oh, God in heaven. He's free. He's free. He's gone. What's the matter? He's done it. He's free. He's a cunning devil! Why was he locked up? He's not mad. No, he's not mad. You know that much, don't you? Who got him the key? Was it you? You! Did you? Where is he? Gone... out into the night. [ SIGHING ] Bats are about. Hark. There's a wolf howling down there. [ WOLF HOWLING ] He'll get them all astir, trust him. You don't know what you've clone, but I know. Are you mad or what? Where is Madame la Baronne? She's not far away. You want to see her? Would you like that? Would you? [ SNICKERS ] Look! You needn't be afraid. She's dead. What have you done? She's dead and he's free. [ Greta guffawing ] [ INSECTS CHITTERING ] [ TOADS CROAKING ] Don't blame me, mistress. It was none of my doing. Nay. I've always kept faith with you. Twenty years since I first saw you come to the castle here... with the old Baron and your little son. A fine, handsome little imp he was, too. But you spoiled him. Oh, yes. He was always self-willed and cruel, and you encouraged him. Aye, and the bad company you kept, too. You used to sit and drink with them, didn't you? Yes, and you laughed at their wicked games. Till in the end one of them took him and made him what he is. [ sighs ] You've done what you could for him since then, God help you... keeping him here a prisoner, bringing these young girls to him... keeping him alive with their blood. But the powers of darkness are too strong. They've beaten you. He's free. But he'll come back here. It's certain. [ SNICKERING ] Aye, he'll come back to his old Greta. He'll come. [ LAUGHING ] He's got to come back here before cock crow. [ BIRDS TWITTERING ] [ CARL EXCLAIMS ] Carl, let's have the travelling rug, will you? [ CARL ] Yes, sir. Good, put it around her. She's not dead, is she? No. A bad case of shock, I should say. Exhaustion. [ GASPS ] Now don't worry. How far are we from Badstein? Three, four kilometres. You've been badly frightened, haven't you? But there's nothing to be afraid of now. I'm a doctor, Dr. Van Helsing. [ HENS CLUCKING ] Now you just sit down here. Landlord? Coffee and cognac, please. I'm very sorry, sir. Please, this young lady's been unwell. Miss, lam glad to see you safe. I'm afraid we're closed for customers this morning, sir. Father Stepmade booked me a room here. I'm Dr. Van Helsing. Yes, of course. I'm sorry, sir. I'll go and get you some coffee. There's been a death in the village. Hans? daughter, such a beautiful girl. She was found dead in the forest. They're holding a wake through there now. How did she die? No one really knows. But she's dead, all right. And Father Stepmade's away. They're going to bury her in the churchyard without him. May I see her? You could see her, of course. They'd probably like you to, being a doctor. But there's nothing can be done. I won't be long. [ PEOPLE CHATTERING ] [ MEN RECITING PRAYERS ] Wild garlic? Yes, it's supposed to be a protection against evil... vampires and such. You must humour these local superstitions. After all, who knows how she came by her death? There's usually a good reason for all these old customs. There's her father. He's a doctor. I'm so very sorry. She was a good girl. I can't believe she's dead. If only the cure was here. The whole night was like a bad dream. I can hardly believe it happened. Don't talk about it, then. The Baroness seemed so kind at first... but her son... Her son? But surely he's not still alive? It's such a long story. Do you feel well enough to travel now? Yes. Goodbye and thank you. I shall be back later on. The next thing I remember was seeing you. I'm afraid I have put you to a lot of trouble. Not at all. What was the name of this ch?teau where you stayed? The Ch?teau of Meinster. Do you know it? I know of it. And you're on your way to the School for Young Ladies at Badstein. I am to teach there, French and deportment. I'm sure you'll do very well at both. Merci. What about your luggage? I left it behind at the ch?teau. I shall have to send for it. To the Ch?teau Meinster? I don't think that will be very wise. But... Please, let me explain. I've been asked to make a study of a strange sickness. A sickness partly physical, partly spiritual. And may I know what it is? Have you heard of the cult of the undead? The undead? Yes. Have you heard of it? No. Are you sure? Quite sure. It is most prevalent in Transylvania and the Lower Danube. And could it spread? Unless it is stamped out. That's why I am here. And you can help me. I want you to tell me everything that happened at the Ch?teau Meinster. But... Everything in detail... leaving nothing out, however trivial it may seem to you. Will you do that? Yes. And when you've told me, I want you to forget it. Forget it completely and never mention it to anyone. If that is what you wish. That is a promise? Yes. Good. [ LAUGHING ] d [ PLAYING PIANO ] d [ GIRLS LAUGHING ] [ CHILDREN CHATTERING ] This is Mademoiselle Danielle. She has come to take up her appointment. Will you come in? [ CHATTERING STOPS ] I'll tell the principal you're here. I'll see to it, Elsa. [ EXCLAIMS ] You must be Marianne Danielle, are you? I am Frau Lang. Welcome to the Academy. Thank you. This is Dr. Van Helsing. How do you do? How do you do? He's been kind enough to accompany me from the last village. Her coach broke down. There was an accident, then? You're all right, aren't you, my dear? No bones broken or anything? Thank you. I'm quite all right. But she lost all her luggage. How unfortunate. We can fix you up with anything you want until it's retrieved. Come along and meet Herr Lang. He'll have heard you arrive, and he doesn't like to be kept waiting. Between you and me, he's rather a stickler. I must get back to my... No. Please come, too, Dr. Van Helsing. You can help explain everything. Mademoiselle is a little late, and Herr Lang is so very punctilious. A wonderful man... wonderful but just a little terrifying. [ chuckling ] Now girls, don't stand there staring. Christina, you'll catch a fly in that mouth if you don't shut it, dear. [ CHILDREN LAUGHING ] Let me do the talking. [ KNOCK ON DOOR ] Otto, my love... mademoiselle has armed. So I heard, late. I am sorry. Mademoiselle, punctuality comes next to cleanliness. But, Otto, the poor girl... Excuses, always excuses. I assure you, sir, that this was unavoidable. And who might you be? A friend of mademoiselle's. I have made it a rule, sir, a rule of the Academy. The staff are allowed no followers. No followers. I am a doctor. Lydon University? Almost a colleague. My dear Dr. Van Helsing, you had only to tell me. Heavens, how could I be expected to recognize... a doctor of philosophy, a doctor of theology... a professor of metaphysics by the cut of his trousers? I trust, Herr Lang, that you will allow me to visit mademoiselle during her stay? My dear doctor, the rule is already rescinded in your favour. Thank you. And now, if you will excuse me. My dear sir, your most obedient servant, always. Come along, my dear. I'll show you to your room. [ girls chattering ] Come along now, girls. No more gawking, please. You heard what I said. Gina, I shall want you in a moment, dear. How can I thank you enough for all your kindness? By keeping your promise. I'll try. And don't let that ogre in there frighten you. Please call again whenever you may be passing, Doctor. Frau Lang. Goodbye, mademoiselle. Aurevoir. Please, I can see myself out. Such a charming man. Yes, a kind man. Yes. Gina. She's a student teacher like you. Gina, mademoiselle has just arrived, and she doesn't know anybody. I want you to show her to her room. Yes, Frau Lang. Room number 14. I always feel strange when I arrive in a new place, don't you? You'll settle down. Come along. [ HENS CLUCKING ] [ HENS CLUCKING ] Why, Father? Why should it happen to her? She was like a mother to her two little sisters. Why should God, in his wisdom, permit these things? Where is she, my son? Where is she, Hans? You know I must go to her. You're too late, Father. She's buried. Where? In the churchyard, where else? In hallowed ground? Isn't that the right of every man and woman? May God forgive you. She's dead, isn't she? Why can't she lie in peace like all the rest? Because she is not like all the rest. You know how she died, my son. I know how your heart bleeds, but she can't lie there. Please, Father. Please let her stay. Even if you can't give her the blessing of our holy Mother Church... please let her stay. My son... you must put out of your mind the idea that she ever was your daughter. She is no longer like the living... not even, God help us, the dead. No. No! [ FOOTSTEPS PATTERING ] Please, drink this. Poor man. And I am powerless, powerless! Perhaps I can help. Who are you? You sent for me. Dr. Van Helsing. Thank God you've come. Thank God. There. Will you unpack yourself, sir? Thank you. What is this.... Vampirism should I call it? It's a survival of one of the ancient pagan religions... in their struggle against Christianity. And there's first, as it was, the vampire? The undead. And that passes on? Yes. The vampire, by its kiss, the taking of blood from its victim... makes of their victim another vampire. So the cult grows... infinitely slowly, but it grows. The vampire rests in the day, usually in his tomb... issuing as a living form only at night. And that means they need the help, the protection... of a human being during the hours of daylight. For instance? A mother who may hide an infected son or daughter. Or a servant... either hypnotized or so devoted to the master... they don't realize the evil they're doing. A lost soul? Possibly. If it wasn't for this protection... the vampires could be tracked down during the day and destroyed. How can they be destroyed? By driving a wooden stake through the heart or by burning. The tormented soul is then released... to return to the peace of death. These colonies, such as you have here, must be wiped out. Only then will this bondage of hell be lifted from the world. Are there ways of telling these undead from the living? They're repelled by holy things and Christian images. They're thin. They have an air of hunger about them. They cast no reflection. Not in water? Not in a mirror? No. And some have the power to transform themselves into bats. Is that the girl's grave? [ Fr. Stepmade ] Yes, it must be. There's still time. The sun's not down yet. She won't be active until then. Isn't it sacrilege? No, Father. It is, as I told you, an act of healing. She'll be in God's hands again and can lie in consecrated ground. I pray that it may be so. If I don't stop her now, she'll rise again as an undead... and a new cycle of evil will begin. Remember, they are my people. I am their priest. Then pray for me. [ LOW WHIRRING ] will, my son. And please... will you take this with you? It contains holy water. It may be of service to you. Thank you, Father. [ GRETA ] Wake up. Wake up. Wake up, my dear, wake up. It's time you awaken. The master's waiting for you... }[ GRETA CHATTERING ] waiting to see you. Come, wake up. Wake up. Wake up, my little dear. [ exclaims ] Are you about ready? No, I can't help you. You've got to be strong. What? Yes, I know it's dark, but you've got to push. Yes, push. That's right, push. Now, just one little effort more. You'll soon be here. Come now. Come, my precious. [ COFFIN RATTLING ] That's right. Come, my little love. There, the master's waiting for you. [ LAUGHING ] There she is. She comes. There's my little beauty. A clever one. There's my clever one. [ gravel rumbling ] [ FR. STEPMADE ] Stop! In the name of the Almighty. Get away. Get away from here. Go, little one, quickly! Lay a hand on her, I'll tear your eyes out. Hurry, my son, before the girl gets away. [ GRUNTS ] [ CHURCH BELL TOLLING ] [ SCREECHING ] [ CLOCK TICKING ] [ CREAKING ] [ METAL RATTLING ] Who is it, that is not afraid? Only God has no fear. Why have you come here? To find your son. Then you know who I am. I know who you were. [ THUDDING ] [ SCREECHES ] [ FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING ] He's escaped? Yes. You'll never catch him. He's too clever. He has taken the blood of his own mother. It was all my own fault. I loved his wildness. I encouraged it. And when this monstrous thing took possession of him... I didn't send for a priest or a doctor. I hid him and helped him to live. And now there's no release from this life... which isn't life or death. And I know I shall have to do whatever hideous thing he asks me to. There is one release. [ KNOCK ON DOOR ] [ KNOCK ON DOOR ] Come in. I am sorry, Frau Lang. I did not know it was you. It's perfectly all right, my dear. I thought I'd better come with the news myself. You know how the girls chatter. My dear, he's here. Who? Why ever didn't you tell us to expect him? Luckily, Herr Lang's gone to the village. I don't know what he'd say, if he knew. But who is it? Come along, my dear, you mustn't keep him waiting. Monsieur le baron. You see, didn't I keep it to myself? I wanted so much to meet you again... so I took this opportunity of bringing the luggage that you left behind. I thought that you might need it. How kind of you. Your mother, Madame la Baronne, is she well? I regret to have to tell you... that she is dead. [ GASPS ] Oh, dear, lam sorry. So now you're all alone up in that great house? Exactly. Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Now Monsieur, I shall leave you entirely to yourselves... for 10 minutes. [ chuckling ] Marianne. [ Mr. Lang ] What are you doing? Keeping an eye on things. Trust me. Keeping an eye on what? A pair of turtle doves, bless their hearts. Who? Mademoiselle Danielle and a young man, dear. What? Stop. What do you think you're doing? Shameless little hussy. Herr Lang. You know it's a rule, my rule. The staff are allowed no followers. What the devil do you think you're doing here? I was placed here by a most charming lady, in fact, your wife. Don't you try to be impertinent to me, sir... or I shall have the privilege of throwing you head first out of that window. You'll find it a most interesting way of making my closer acquaintance, Herr Lang... but hardly necessary under the circumstances. I've long wanted to meet you, an old and valued tenant. I'm no tenant of yours, you young jackass. I'm a tenant of the Meinster Estate. Exactly, and I am Baron Meinster. I must apologize for not having called before... but I had been recovering from... along illness.. I wouldn't have come today except that I had some pressing business... to discuss with Mademoiselle Danielle... who has just consented to become my wife. Wonderful. [ SPEAKING GERMAN ] I shall be grateful if she could stay here for a few weeks... whilst I make arrangements for the wedding. Of course, we should be more than honoured. Yes, indeed. May I take this opportunity of congratulating you and Frau Lang... on having the most charming house and grounds... [ SPEAKING GERMAN ] at so low a rent. I'm so proud for you, Marianne. What's it feel like to be a baroness? Not so fast. We are only engaged. Isn't he handsome? [ LOW WHIRRING ] think he is. [ SIGHS ] And so he should be marrying you. He's just like I imagined Prince Charming was to look at... so noble... and with such wonderful eyes. Such tenderness in them and humour, too. I must be careful. I'll be falling in love with him, myself. I shan't allow that. The toast. What a terrible smell. I'm so sorry. Never mind. I'll go down for some more bread. Fraulein won't mind. [ DOOR CLOSING ] [ SIGHS ] [ LOW WHIRRING ] wish it had been me. [ LEAVES RUSTLING ] [ BIRDS CHIRPING ] [ BIRDS CHIRPING ] [ COCK CROWING ] [ BARONESS GRUNTS ] Thank heaven you're safe. Father. What happened to that woman? I'm afraid she got away from me soon after you'd gone. I tried to follow, but lost track of her in the dark. How did you fare? I went to the ch?teau. You remember when you wrote to me, asking me to come here? You told me of your suspicions about the Baron and his mother. I do, indeed. They were well-founded. The Baroness had become the victim of her own son. Oh, no. She is dead now and at peace. God rest her soul. But her son escaped with the girl. My son, we have a great deal to thank you for already... but I'm afraid your work is not yet finished. You must be tired. You should have some food. I'll join you presently. [ DR. TOBLER ] ls it well and truly boiling? Straight out of the kettle, Doctor. Good. That's right. Of course, it might have been chest... bronchitis or pneumonia. You never could tell. Extract of gum benzoin. [ MUMBLING ] Yes, tincture of myrrh. I only want a drop of that. Just a drop. Yes, liquor of capsicum, plenty of that. Ad lib. Ad lib. Now, my very good woman, the towel. That's right, right over my head. And don't you pay any attention to anything I may say. Here we go. [ SIGHS ] [ SCREAMING ] [ LAUGHING ] My very dear, kind Frau, I can't breathe! You're killing.... Mercy! [ LAUGHING ] I can't breathe! Very well, there you are. [ PANTING ] What the devil? I told you not to pay any attention to anything I said. Let's have another try, shall we? You can see after yourself, thank you. I've got my living to earn. What we doctors have to put up with. First it's you clericals, Father... with your monolithic superstitions. Then peasants like her with their troglodyte indifference. Of course, she may have died of heart failure. I mean, the heart may have just... slowed down and stopped. That's clearly a case for nox vomica. Or perhaps it galloped itself to a standstill. In that case, digitalis. And, of course, always, and all the time... Valerian, to quiet my nerves. [ EXCLAIMS ] I say, I haven't drunk you out of house and home. But if the patient is dead, what's the use of all these concoctions? Precautions are better than cure, Father. By doing this... I've survived a vast number of other people's deaths. I mean to survive a great many more. But who's dead? One of the young girls at the Academy. She died quite suddenly in the night, I behave. Dr. Tobler, this is Dr. Van Helsing. Are you sure it was one of the pupils, not one of the staff? That I can't say. Doctor, if you're going to see her... it would be best for you to take Dr. Van Helsing with you. He's one of the most eminent medical men in Europe. Would you come for nothing? Certainly. Splendid. I might put your specialist's fee on my own little account. Worth trying, anyhow. Would that be all right with you? Why not? Thank you. Shall we go, then? Thank you. [ MRS. LANG SOBBING ] [ MRS. LANG SOBBING ] [ SNIFFLING ] You say the door was locked? Yes, on the inside... but the window was open. Open? Yes. We found her lying on the bed. What did she die from? I'm not sure. But I must know. Such a thing, if we can't say what it is... might mean ruin for us. I shall have to make a further examination. Perhaps you and Frau Lang will leave us. What shall we make the verdict? Have you ever seen anything like this? That's a bite, isn't it? Have you ever seen it before? Very seldom. Once or twice in the villages in the forest. You know, that's probably a pet animal, a dog or a cat. The villagers fondle them, you know. It's a very unhealthy practice. We can't stop them. This is the mark of the vampire... sometimes called the seal of Dracula. You see how it cuts through the vein? A vampire? [ chuckling ] No, I'm afraid not. Well, the peasants are always going on about... all about werewolves and vampires. I'm a scientist. I always laugh at those ridiculous legends. I shouldn't, if I were you. I don't want these people to know. Will you leave everything to me? By all means, I'll leave everything to you. Except the fee, of course. [ CHUCKLING ] Her death was due to a fever. Yes, a fever. It is very contagious. I have locked the door to her room. Here is the key. What else must we do? The undertakers came this morning. They'll be back again tomorrow. Listen, these are my instructions. Are there any outer buildings here? The stables, of course. Good. Let her lie there in her coffin until the burial. No, Dr. Van Helsing, the poor dear child. Two responsible people... must keep watch over her coffin until nightfall. I'll be back by then. In the meantime, you must lock the house... keep all the doors and windows shut... and let none of your pupils be alone at any time. Is that understood? Of course. We can organize this right away. Excuse us, Doctor. Marianne will see you out. Come, Helga. I'm so sorry, my dear. All this upset, so soon after your arrival. But don't let it spoil your personal happiness. Have you told Dr. Van Helsing? [ MR. LANG ] Helga. Coming, dear. May I have a glass of wine? Did you have something to tell me? You have been so kind to me. I would like you to know lam engaged to be married. I'm so very happy for you. Congratulations. May I know who is the lucky man? Le baron Meinster. What? What is the matter? He has been here? Yes. Did you let him kiss you? Tell me, please. Only my hand. Why do you do that? Are you in love with him? Yes, lam. I see. Aren't you going to wish me well? Of course. When are you seeing him again? I'm not sure. Tomorrow, I hope. Are you ready, Dr. Tobler? Of course. Coming. Coming. [ CHUCKLING ] [ HOOVES PATTERING ] If only they'd keep quiet. It's the poor young lady yonder. No horse can abide a corpse nearby. [ HORSE NICKERING ] [ KNOCK ON DOOR ] [ HORSE GRUNTING ] [ HORSE NEIGHING ] Marianne. I have come to see if I may relieve you until Dr. Van Helsing comes. Have you really, my dear? How kind of you. I won't say no. Oh, clear, I'm almost as jumpy as those poor horses. Good night, Steadman. Good night, madam. Thank you again, Marianne. Good night. Good night. [ horse nickering ] Admiring the brasses? You keep them so bright and clean. You know, all of these remind me of the seasons of the year. This set here... reminds me of spring in the bush shire... picnics, bathing in the streams... drying in the sunshine. And that? Autumn. Gypsies... galloping along the grass verges of the roads. Fine boys, fine girls. [ MARIANNE ] And this? The winter. Just look at that now. [ GRUNTS ] You and I... will sleep as sound in a nice simple coffin of elm or oak. They have to have cedar and always this brassware. It's locked. This one is tight enough. S?verin, will you please go and fetch Herr Lang? [ LOW WHIRRING ] will, if you wish it. I do wish it, please. Very well, but I warn you, he won't like it. Pay no heed to the horses. [ HORSES NEIGHING ] Shut your hole, will you? [ SCREAMING ] [ HORSE NEIGHING ] [ GASPS ] Marianne, my darling Marianne. You haven't forgotten your little Gina? Put your arms around me, please. I want to kiss you, Marianne. Please be kind to me. Say that you forgive me for letting him love me. [ SHUDDERING ] We can both love him, my darling. He's up at the old mill now. We can go there together. Come with me, Marianne. Bring some brandy and hot water. Yes, Doctor. Marianne... did you see who it was? It was dreadful. You know, don't you? She looked exactly like Gina... except... It was Gina. But it couldn't have been. She's dead. Gina is now an undead. Oh no. She's the third victim since the Baron was set free. The Baron? You mean the Baron Meinster? I do. Oh, no. I won't listen to you. You must know I wouldn't say such a thing unless I was absolutely sure. I've got to find him. Do you know where he is? No. Where is he, Marianne? If you know, you must tell me. Marianne, where is he? Tell me. The mill. The old windmill. Marianne, wear this rosary. It will protect you. And when I've gone, I beg you to lock yourself in... and answer the door to no one. You must obey me in this. Look after her. Yes, Doctor. [ Greta laughing ] Go on, get him. Obey your master, take him. Take him! [ SCREECHES ] [ SCREAMING ] [ BOTH GRUNTING ] [ GROANS ] [ GRUNTING ] [ GASPING ] [ DOOR CLOSES ] [ GROANS ] [ PANTING ] [ CHARCOAL CRACKLING ] [ SNIFFLES ] [ GLASS SHATTERING ] [ GASPS ] [ SCREAMS ] [ GRUNTS ] [ SIGHS ] I brought someone to see you, Van Helsing. Beautiful, isn't she? What a pity that such beauty must fade... unless we preserve it. She's going to join us, Doctor... and you are going to watch her initiation. Marianne, don't look at his eyes. Marianne, look at me! [ SCREAMING ] MARIANNE! [ GRUNTING ] [ PANTING ] [ GROANING ] [ GROWLING ] [ GASPING ]
