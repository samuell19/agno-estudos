♪♪♪ CUNNINGHAM: I never was interested in dancing that referred fo a mood, or a feeling, or in a sense, expressed the music. So that the dancing does not refer. It is what it is. It's that whole visual experience. ♪♪♪ [FINGERS SNAPPING] Out. Stretch. [INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE] Two, down and down. Up. Yeah. Step. Hold. Hold. Hold. ♪♪♪ JOURNALIST: Tonight, the world of dance welcomes Merce Cunningham. He has asked us not to call him an avant-garde choreographer, or a modern dance choreographer. So I'm going to ask him what we may call him. CUNNINGHAM: Well, I'm a dancer. JOURNALIST: That says everything? CUNNINGHAM: Well, that's sufficient for me. ♪♪♪ CUNNINGHAM: Since my dancers and I are a group of human beings, we are that on the stage, as we are in real life, people moving around in various ways. But we don't interpret something. We present something, we do something, and then any kind of interpretation is left up to anybody looking at it in the audience. CUNNINGHAM: My idea about movement is that any movement is possible for dancing. That ranges all the way from nothing, of course, up to the most extended kind of movement that one might think up. JOURNALIST: Your background is in modern dance, is it, Merce Cunningham? CUNNINGHAM: Yes. JOURNALIST: Now, did you evolve a technique of your own? CUNNINGHAM: Well, physically or technically, I was interested in extending movement possibilities as I saw them. I thought that a ballet technique for the legs was astonishing, and I thought many things in the modern dance were remarkable for the torso. And so I tried to find ways to combine those to make a body which was flexible and pliant and allowed for as many movement possibilities as I could see. CUNNINGHAM: Dance exercises over dancers an insidious attraction that makes them work hours daily at perfecting an instrument which is really deteriorating from birth. To what end this eternal daily struggle? Because inside of all that is an ecstasy. Brief perhaps, not always released, but when it is, like a moment in balance when all things great and small coincide. This can happen at any moment, and when it does for a dancer, he can smile without knowing it. There is no guarantee of this, but it does exist. We see it, and we know it. [CARS HONKING] NARRATOR: CUNNINGHAM: Myself, I don't think of discipline as, like, rules. I think of discipline as being something private, which, in the case of a dancer, he realizes that the discipline, say, of going to class, is part of his life. He arrives at this point within himself. It's more like meditation, devotion, I think, than anything else. ♪♪♪ CUNNINGHAM: I went to school in Seattle, Washington, and Mr. Cage was there, and he taught us a composition class. And it was so remarkable, I never forgot this. The next year, I went to New York, and Mr. Cage joined eventually. So he's been writing music for me ever since. ♪♪♪ CAGE: People have, um, often defended art on the grounds that life was a mess, and that, therefore, we needed art in order to escape from life. I would like to have an art that was so, uh, bewildering, complex, and, uh, illogical that we would return to everyday life with, uh, great pleasure. ♪♪♪ [INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE] There is no such thing as silence. CAGE: I have nothing to say, and I am saying it. And that is poetry as I need it. [WOMAN VOCALIZING] BROWN: First time I met Merce Cunningham, he was touring the States with John Cage. I'd never seen anyone move like that, from such a quiet center, with such animal authority and human passion. CAGE: Merce Cunningham's doctor used to be Dr. Lotman. Dr. Lotman's the one who prescribed Merce's vitamin pills and breakfast powders. He told Merce to sit when he didn't have to stand, to lie down when he didn't have to sit, and to sleep whenever he could sleep. Possessed of an active disposition, Cunningham keeps busy even when he's sitting. With pen or pencil he makes calendars, circling the days involving performances or other engagements. One calendar finished, he starts another. For years, sitting at the breakfast table, he taught himself Russian. This enabled him to speak in their language to members of the Bolshoi Ballet before performing with his company for them. Having learned to knit, he knitted the many-colored costume he wears in "Lavish Escapade." [STATIC BUZZING] CUNNINGHAM: I simply decided years ago that I would make a dance free of the music. And then we would put the sound and the dance together. JOURNALIST: Then, actually, you have never heard his music, and has he seen your dance? CUNNINGHAM: No. JOURNALIST: And the night of the performance, you will combine the two? CUNNINGHAM [CHUCKLING]: With any luck. JOURNALIST: What, then, reactions have you had to that? [LAUGHING] Well, all the way from absolute stupefaction on the part of an audience to, uh... to people liking it very much. NARRATOR: [MUSIC PLAYING] [BIRDS CHIRPING] ♪♪♪ CUNNINGHAM: When I began to work with dancers who were trained in other techniques, it didn't function for me. So I decided that maybe if I could teach... ♪♪♪ I must say the first class I gave, There was one person who showed up, a wonderful Marianne Preger-Simon, who said, "Well, will you give the class?" And I said yes. So I began. DILLEY: I've always felt, during the time when I worked with him, although he was giving out all of the activity that we did, there was a great space for you to do it yourself. FARBER: I think that Merce was interested in what could be considered our flaws as dancers. And he hesitated to correct us unless he just got irritated by what he saw. I think he was much more of an artist rather than a teacher who was going to try to get us to do things up to some perfect and ideal standard. SETTERFIELD: I found I was doing things that I never dreamed were possible. And the world was opening up in a whole way that I hadn't understood. GUS: The thing that's so hard about working with Merce is that he demands that you are first of all yourself as a human being, and from that, a dancer. [SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] SETTERFIELD: And you move on it? Yes. There again, you can walk up or not. CUNNINGHAM: I myself never liked that competitive thing that so much of dancing seemed to me to have, so I never tried to do that in my own situation. I went on the assumption that each dancer was a person who had certain abilities. I would attempt to let each of the dancers find out for himself how he danced, what kind of a person he was in that situation. It's not politics, it was dancing, but that's as reasonable a place to do that as any other situation. MAN: One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. [PIANO PLAYING] CUNNINGHAM: In the early '50s, that point that my company, So to speak, began. I didn't form it. It just began. We just sort of got together and tried to keep together. [CHUCKLING] That's all there is to it. [PIANO PLAYING] Suddenly, there's a company of three people, or eight people, or 60 people, I don't think it matters, it's only in proportion. Then you have to consider all of those people in all the ways. The fact that they are people, they must somehow get from day to day, you know, and have some place to sleep, something to eat, all of that. And all of that has to be taken into consideration, as well as the fact that you are now not only responsible for making a dance for yourself, but for these other dancers too. And that implies something about clothing, heh, covering them up some way, something about music, however you think of that, and all that gets more... involves more funds, one way or another. But you do it, don't you? JOURNALIST: The way you function? Yes. You find a way to function or you quit. JOURNALIST: Yes, of course. JOURNALIST: What do you do during rehearsal? How does this all happen? CUNNINGHAM: We rehearse, and then I will keep track via stopwatch of a given section. One of the pieces that we used to do was "Suite for Five," and we could go several months without rehearsing that dance, and then do it and we would come out within, oh, at the most, 10 seconds difference. BROWN: Merce's way of working with a stopwatch, which so shocked the modern dance world, led to the company's reputation of being cold, inhuman, impassive, expressionless automatons. CUNNINGHAM: It seemed to me that, in the society around us, there were so many scientific possibilities coming up that one did not have to think in terms of one thing following another, but, say, in a field. And I began to make dances with those possibilities in mind. So to speak, compositional method was by using chance, or random means. NARRATOR: CUNNINGHAM: If I don't like what comes up with the chance procedures, do I then throw it away? In other words, do I let my taste enter this thing? And I, uh, don't. I try it out. BROWN: Our audiences were artists. The great American painters, they were just becoming well-known. They were still poor. RAUSCHENBERG: Well, the people who really seemed to accept my work were dancers and musicians, while I was considered a clown by nearly everyone else. And, uh, I found a lot more rapport with, uh, their ideas about what, uh, art was than I did with a lot of painters. CAGE: We became friends immediately. We understood, without speaking, how the other one felt. Almost a sense of identity. ♪♪♪ CUNNINGHAM: Bob Rauschenberg described it once, he said we have only two things in common, our ideas and our poverty. Ha-ha-ha. I thought that was a marvelous description. And it brought us together. [PIANO PLAYING] RAUSCHENBERG: Merce is not the easiest person to work with in the first place. He hates sets. [MERCE LAUGHING] RAUSCHENBERG: He hates costumes. So I mean, you really have to work around without his even noticing. [MUSIC PLAYING] CUNNINGHAM: I said, "Bob, I want to wear a chair on my back" in one of the dances. He looked at me, and then a few minutes later he said: "If you have a chair, can I have a door?" And I said, "Certainly. Why not?" [PIANO PLAYING] RAUSCHENBERG: One of the most amazing things about our collaboration was sort of a carte-blanche trust, where nobody is really responsible, but as a group of people, are not irresponsible. And I think that creates a kind of a wonderful feeling about the possibilities of society. CUNNINGHAM: I don't know what will happen until it's put, let's say, in the first performance. I prefer to risk, so to speak, to chance that, that this combination of things, some of which I don't know about, may produce something else. [MUSIC PLAYING] RAUSCHENBERG: I used to be so jealous of John because John couldn't do anything wrong, but making costumes and sets... [MAN LAUGHING] I was always in the furniture business, and you can trip overeither the set or the costumes. But you can't trip on a note. [MUSIC PLAYING] CUNNINGHAM: Well, in "Summerspace," all I said was that the dance didn't have any center. RAUSCHENBERG: I knew what you meant. There was gonna be just as much dancing in the wings. So I planned a kind of a camouflage. So if anybody hesitated, they were lost in the background. [PIANO PLAYING] CUNNINGHAM: We worked on "Summerspace" today. In Summerspace, the principal momentum was the concern for steps that carry one through space. Like the passage of birds stopping for moments on the ground, and then going on, or automobiles throbbing along turnpikes and under and over clover leaves. The dance came out to have a great deal of turning in it, which was upsetting to the dancers. "I can't turn." "How do you turn?" The only way to do it is to do it. CUNNINGHAM: I continued to work out the dance every day after teaching, with all of us growing wearier as the weeks went on. And we presented it on a Sunday matinee, in the spot costumes and against the pointillist backdrop by Robert Rauschenberg, and with the graph music by Morton Feldman. The audience was puzzled. ♪♪♪ CUNNINGHAM: When we started, we didn't want to simply stay in New York and give one program maybe in a small theater, and then hope for the rest of the year to pay it off, and so on. So we began to drive. CAGE: The Cunningham Company used to make transcontinental tours in a Volkswagen Microbus. Once, when we drove up to a gas station in Ohio, and the dancers, as usual, all piled out to go to the toilets and exercise around the pumps. The station attendant asked me whether we were a group of comedians. I said, "No. We're from New York." CUNNINGHAM: The real collaboration was all getting into that Volkswagen bus. RAUSCHENBERG: I had to sit next to the driver when we played Scrabble. Until Carolyn Brown's husband said that she would have to leave the company if we didn't stop playing Scrabble while we drove looking for mushrooms. CUNNINGHAM: It was fun too. RAUSCHENBERG: It was horrible too. CUNNINGHAM: But that's what we could do, so we did it. MAN: John... CAGE: It's been eaten up by animals. Hypholomaornaematoloma, and they are changing the name. DILLEY: There are nine of you chugging along from one place to another, and, uh, they were very tribal. And John was incredibly generous all the time. He organized these lovely picnics and... In those days, we had our food and lodgings paid for and got 25 dollars a performance, and that was it. CAGE: On top of which they said the music was impossible. And there was a lady who wrote to say that she had come to New York from a distance, and that in order to do that she had had to employ a babysitter. And they printed this in the paper. The critic printed it. And that when she got there, what she saw and what she heard was so bad, you see, that she had, so to speak, been cheated out of all this money... The ticket, the train ticket, and the babysitter. And then the critic added that we had no right to treat people in this cruel fashion. ♪♪♪ JOURNALIST: When you and Cage were first touring together during those early years, did you have enough belief in what you were doing to not be discouraged by the negative reactions? CUNNINGHAM: The only thing for me is that I really am deeply fond of dancing. So no matter how dire the situation was, how desperate, I would wake up one day and start to work and suddenly realize that it was just as interesting as it always had been, regardless of the circumstances. But we also, as we toured, we began to have friends... Not many. But every place there would be a few people who would be very interested in what we had done. ♪♪♪ What's gratifying to a dancer, really, is performing, more than... More than anything else. Rehearsal has a certain class, has a certain kind of gratification, but not, you know, not as much as performing, and we do it so little. And then when it's over, what is there? You know, you go back to your solitary flat, and your horrible job, and there's nothing. I never thought that's what it's about. I think the real thing is the fact that you continue, that you keep on doing things, because it isn't about the money, or not having money, or... anything like that, it's about making something. CUNNINGHAM: How do you make a movement alive, technique or not? How do you keep in the dancing, however long studied, practiced, and repeated, that spontaneous act the stance of a cat can give you? It is for me a question of faith and a continuous belief in the surprise of the instant. Put aside fatigue, aches, injuries to the body and the psyche. Let the shape and the time of a single or multiple action take its weight and measure. It will be expressive. BROWN: My first recollection of "Crises" was Merce was making for himself all these wonderful solos. I mean, they were mad and lots of dramatic stuff in them, and we never got to do that. And Viola and I said, “In the next piece we want to be witches." And that's what he made. ♪♪♪ BROWN: People take Merce at his word. They absolutely believe him that it's only steps that he's putting on the stage, but it isn't true. It's not a dance of two people. I mean, the women do certain things, but all of the, uh, real action is initiated by him. I'm picked up and carried, and it's also very little face to face. That's very much true, I think, in almost all of the duet things. ♪♪♪ NEELS:/f I were to go to him and say, "Merce", what does this... This exotic fall that Gus and I do mean? "What's it supposed to mean?" You know? MAN: He'd snort and turn his back. He'd take it away from us. He'd say, don't do it. Which side are you going to go to? All right, hold on, hold on. Hold on. Just down, that's it. That's all. Is that all right? Now turn, Gus. That's right, so that way, Gus. That's fine. Now, Sandra, let go. Take your arms away. That's right. Now, excuse me... Now curve your trunk. Give me this arm. Bring it right up. That's it. DILLEY: Unfortunately, it doesn't come ever with any clear understanding as to why you are or are not being included, except that... Merce is like a painter, and we're all like different colors. And he wants some colors, and other times, he doesn't. ♪♪♪ BROWN: I think there's a great sense of love within the company, one for the other, and, uh... Merce isn't able to express that... openly, but after a while you sense it. JOURNALIST: He never expresses it openly?

CUNNINGHAM: You see, this piece by the combination of the elements produces this violent display, but the kind of violence it produces is special to each spectator. One was race riots, and one was atomic bomb, and one was concentration camps, and on and on.

Do people do it after dinner?” [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] NARRATOR: BROWN: Oh, God. Six months with the same group of 20 people is hard. Anyway, when Bob left, this was a time when communication was particularly poor between dancers and Merce.
