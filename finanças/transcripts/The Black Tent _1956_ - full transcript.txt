Director Brian DESMOND HURST Your brother was reported missing, presumed killed during the campaign in the desert, I suppose? Yes. I think I am right in saying that the captain Holland last heard in the... uh... ... In May of 1942? Yes, in May! Of course, once he was your older brother , his estate goes to you. All right, Major Croft, it is. Listen... What I'm going to say further, more... delicately. Go ahead! Can you imagine something due to what your brother could be a convenient... ... The abyss of mind? What are you? I guess he did not have any motive to disappear ? No one disappears just wartime directly to the service! You are either killed, captured or prisoner or defected. My brother was awarded the Order of for excellent service. Yes, I am familiar with a track record your brother. And yet, sometimes people, when faced with great danger may fracture... ... For no apparent reason. And yet, something always a reason. - Like what? - Blackmail, probably... long! Or what novelists call unrequited love. It is not so rarely happens. If you are so familiar with a track record my brother... ... I think you should know, that his death is a significant condition. Blackmail - not even discussed! - I have to make out all his papers. - Oh sure. But... you have not seen it. Genuine? It's his handwriting, all right. Where did you get? When fighting broke out in the Western Desert our soldiers it was said that in emergency situations... ... They are always safe to may seek refuge with Bedouin. They were also told that if they will remain for some time, they have to write a bill... ... To whom they bequeathed... ... And that these notes will eventually fall into command rate. Well, after the campaign ended, these notes began to appear. Little. Perhaps a little of our guys had time to write them. Or maybe, again, it Bedouins were too proud to accept money for their hospitality. But this note... ... It was handed over to the British embassy in Tripoli just two weeks ago. - And by whom? - Bedouin. And he knows something about my brother? As far as I can tell - no. - He was rewarded? - Not yet. - But it will be? - That's not for me to decide. What you decide? Nothing. I am here only in order to find out different . - And what you found out? - Oh, probably very little. But the war is long gone and now there are only one or two available paths. Unlimited assistant, for example. Tell me something... What kind of help you could give someone... ... Like me who have no special knowledge regarding the of this country... ... But who would like to trace the of the note until its source? Officially - no. Unofficially, well... I started a lot of friends who live in different strange places. - Charles Holland? -Yes. - I - Baring. How are you? - It is good that you met me. I've got a car. We will go as soon as you pass through customs . I'm glad you got my letter. Croft was not sure of the address. How's old Croft? We were here to serve military government after the war. Easy job of work, while all continued. That's just for some of us it lasted too long. What did you find out for me? I followed Bedouin who brought note from your brother. - We'll see you with him? - Oh sure. My guy just looking for it in the Old Town. [Spoke in Arabic] Peace be with you ! Received a note with you? Yes, here it is. - Oh, master! I found him. - Oh good! - Peace be with you! - And to you the world! - Who is it? - Sheikh Salem Ben Youssef. - What tribe? - Hivvari. - Where is their pasture? - In Bir Abu vulnerable. He says it gave him Sheikh Salem bin Yousef... ... Whose tribe herding cattle in Bir Abu vulnerable. - And far is it? - How many kilometers? How long ride on camels. Many, many days on camels. Ali! All they organized? The ship of the desert ready to sail, sir. And this seems to me the best. Oh, no, no, Colonel! I think you will find Aishwarya is already too much to get up and go. This is - crazy camel. Colonel finds that Zen - better. And yet only one thing Mr Baring, sir. To me it's now only... ... That unpleasant question of money have not yet surfaced. You will be paid on the day when my friend comes back safe and sound... ... As you yourself know very well. So - go down, and no your tricks! It is very difficult to live without money, sir. Stop! Goodbye, Behring! And thanks! See you when you get back. Good luck! Now... cross your legs, Colonel. Keep your feet on opposite sides cross! Colonel... I have a lot of pictures girls from Tripoli. Can we find a nice girl in Bedouin tents. I hold you scenes of great joy! I recorded for it. I am sure that it is. But I'm afraid I have more important things, which is worth considering. What can be more important than the girl , Colonel? - Peace be with you! - You peace! Where Hawari? - There. - Everything is fine? no. It is now near. - But first - a break, huh? - No! No... Look, Colonel! Black tents! Havvari! - Peace be with you! - And you peace! You are traveling from far away? From Tripoli. Why do you visit our tents? Well, I'm on vacation and would like to explore the country . Examine your people, and your... your customs. Your luggage too light for such a trip. I am ashamed to admit it, but I had hoped hospitality of your people. My house - your house. While you're here, my house - your house. I am very grateful to you. Allah is great! Allah is the greatest! There is no god except Allah alone, who has no companions. Now is the time of our evening prayers. I must leave you. I bear witness that Muhammad - the Messenger of Allah . Can I wander through your camp? Do what you want. Thank God! Praise be to Allah! Allah is great! Allah is the greatest. And there is no god but Allah. Allah is great! Allah is the greatest! War greatly changed your people? Oh, yes! For us, it was a tough war. We have seen so much on both sides. Many of our wounded had taken refuge in your tents, as I know. That's right. Sheikh Salem... - Yes? - When I said that I am here on holiday... ... I have not told you the truth. I think that you have given this Bedouin... ... A note from a British officer named David Holland. The note said about a hundred pounds. Bedouin brought it to Tripoli. I think that David Holland could find shelter... ... In your tent. I want you to tell me about it everything you can. I'm his brother. I would not send a note. But my tribe was tormented by drought. So, you know him? He lived here in your tent? Yes. One day... A long time ago. But you still remember it? He was wounded. We took him to our tents and hide it for a while. When he felt well, he left us. But before he left, he made me take note , of which you speak. And you never saw him again? He did not return to us. How long has he hid in your tent? I do not remember. Too long since it was . - Where he was wounded? - In his right shoulder. His wound healed, when he left you? Perhaps we can talk about it morning. Who is late, and we rise early. If your master anything is required, let me know! Good night! What did you say this, that he was angry, Colonel? I do not know. If you decide to ask me, Colonel, I will tell you that this place - a dump. They do not know anything. Give me a good, clean life and "Coca-Cola" anywhere. The girls here do not appreciate educated person. Well, tonight we leave here, yes, Colonel? We are not leaving. No? No! - Welcome! - Welcome! It was your son? Where's your man? I knew your father's son. His name was David. I - his brother. - Welcome! - Welcome! Can you tell me anything else about my brother? I have told you everything I remember. I've nothing more to say. I think it is. My brother's son is living in your tents. I saw him. - You're wrong. - I do not think so! The child, which you saw, Blonde? Very svetlenky. I also met and spoke with his mother . And because fair-haired child, you decided that his father should have been your race? It's not. Centuries conquerors went through our land: the Phoenicians... ... Greeks, Romans, people from the north. So, sometimes, that our children are born bright. In your tents, a lot of girls. You may know all their secrets? All of the ones they love? No one can know everything. Then, how can you be sure against this girl? How can you say that? Because it is - my daughter. I'm sorry! I enjoyed your hospitality and hurt you. I just wanted to know about his brother. I have already told you, I have nothing more to say to you. You can find their camels and conductor waiting for you. Please come! Gave him. What happened, Colonel? I look for, Colonel? Cigarette, Colonel? Good tea? Yes, very! Oh, Colonel! I forgot! One girl from the tents of Bedouins like you very much. O Ali! You went straight from the pages third-rate novel. Oh, yes! Yes, I know, sir. You're right. When we left, she... ... Invited me into the tent. Of course, I... I think she wants me. - Of course! - But no. You, Colonel. - I find this hard to believe. - And me too. But she pointed me to you, Colonel, and give me a sock. It is a sign of great love? No. But I think maybe there, inside a gift for you. - And he was there? - No. Only some papers. - Paper? - Yes, Colonel. Paper covered with writing. Where sock? Somewhere here in the camel bag. Find him! Here it is, Colonel. It - blog Captain David Holland. Quick, Hassan! Now sleep! You are with your friends. Welcome, Sheikh Faris! - Peace be with you, Sheikh Salem! - And with you be peace! You have very beautiful hands. See what I said? What is your name? - You should eat. - Tell me your name. - Eat. - Please say! I want to thank you for taking care me. I have to learn your name, to do it. Mabrouk. This is a very beautiful name. What does it mean? Or you do not know? Yes... That means... "Blessed." Good for you. Get out! - Welcome! - Welcome! This is Sheikh Faris tribe Anil. He visits our tents from time to time. Welcome, Sheikh Faris! You are now recovered. I would like to thank you and your people . We have done quite enough. How long have I been here? You've been here three days. Now you need to relax and rejuvenate . I have to join to my friends as soon as possible. Where am I now? In Bir Abu vulnerable. As soon as possible I should be in Tobruk. There are no friends for you. Tobruk fell. Not a good time for despair. There are other friends elsewhere. Relax yet. Where Mabrouk? Now that you feel better, it would be wrong for my daughter to be with you. She is young and not married. She returned to the women's tents. Mabrouk promised Sheikh Faris. My brother Khalil will carry you food in the future. - Good night! - Good night, Sheikh Salem! - Welcome! - Welcome! - We ask. - We ask. - Help us! - Help us. - Lead us. - Lead us. - On the way. - By the way... - Right. - Right. - That way. - The path... - Whom you. - Whom do you... Welcome, Sheikh Salem! Praise be to Allah, you are now healthy. David! - Go faster! - What? The Germans! Near the tent of his father! I will hide you! - You'll be safe here. - There were a lot of Germans? I could not see. When they are gone, I will come back to you. And if they will not go? Then I will bring you food and water. Thank you Mabrouk! Take care of yourself! [Speaking German] Tell him that we'll sleep tonight in the tent . The colonel said that they will spend the night here . - And here is a good idea. - Yes. - Just look at all the carpets! - To capture a couple of home. Have time, still capture. - This is Marika R√∂kk, huh? - Yes! "The woman of my dreams." - Well, good night! - Good night! Good night! - Kurt! - Yes? - Come here! - What's the matter? Take a look at this! British gun! - Where did you find him? - Here, under the pillow. Yes, this is exactly the British! Where did he come from here? David! David! What is happening there? Today, they spend the night in our tents. - Many of them? - Eight. - Enough to bring problems. - Here we are safe. It - British revolver. Ask them how they have it. German officer asked where is the British gun. Welcome! But this is exactly the British gun! Ask , where is he? Ask them a question, where they took him. Go back to the ruins. But these ruins are good, is not it? Yes! Let the camera, hurry! - Hey! You better check here. - Good! - There is a passage. - And so. Yes, very well. Do you standing there and stand. - So? - View of a brave, huh? - You finished? -Yes. All is ready. - Good! - Everything worked out? - Now I have you? - Yes, that's better! Here you go! I'll get up, perhaps there is... Yes! How this device works? - You must first turn and then? - First you have to adjust the focus. Do not rush to shoot. - Do not be in a hurry? - Well yes. Wait another moment. Where did he start? - Here? - You just need to turn the... - It's hard work! - All elementary! Well, let's here! Now I mood. Here again - turn the aperture... Then lift the lever, and you're ready to shoot. - Well, yes! - Now everything is set up? The main thing - do not knock! One... two... You have said that you need something click here? I do not see where to click. Yes, you are an idiot! - I do with it? - Simply turn and press! It's very simple, in actual fact. Just click there on top. Yes? Now I understand... - This time for sure! I will show the last time. All out! - Ready. - I get it now. Get ready! Now I will take off! One minute! Seconds! - Now, are you ready? - Yes Yes! One... two... three! Well, now the procedure. - Did not work? - Yes of course! There are obtained great photo for memory, right? - Maybe more? - It's time we have and go! - Welcome! - Greetings, Sheikh Salem! - The Germans found it. - What happened? I told them that he cut your throat. I said so well, that they let me leave it. Thank you! I'm here, too, I was anxious couple seconds. I do not worry about yourself. That's why I decided that you have to stay here . - It will be safer for all of us. - Yes. We are lucky to be rid of them this time. But it gave me the idea. The Germans often pass this way? I am thinking of visiting the ruins. Times. Do you want to participate in the preparation of the plan ? My wound is almost healed and I have no reasons stay here longer. I have to return to his duties. I understand that. Tell us about your plan. On the camel I will not have a chance. But a car! For instance, in the German machine. - Yes? - Photographed they arrive here without protection. As soon as it becomes known about their arrival, we might pass this way. What to get to your tents, they have to travel this road. With your help, I can arrange for them ambush. - Well, well! I will help you! - Thank you! In gratitude for their help, I can offer you just that. This is my bond, which will need to show a my people. Please take! Thank you! David! I wondered all day Do you come. I thought something happened to you. It took too much time, and I decided that befell trouble. Is it because you were hungry. Here is how? And not because they have not seen you? - Are not you hungry? - No. And what do you think? - A lot. - Tell me. When the war is over... ... And I will not wear you food. When you leave home. If I get out of this... I can never go back. - Do not go away from here? - Yes. I guess what I meant. But not only here. I do not want to leave you. - Your land far away? - Yes. Very far. Do you have a wife? No. Wives do not. Why? Are you poor? No. What? There is not only the poor wives. The men, who have no money, to give them the girl's father. You know what's happening, is not it? A Must to say that I love you? Tell me if you think this is true. And to you the same thing. I should not love you. But it's true, is not it? Yes. What are you doing? I look at you. Do you sleep? No, not really. - Just think. - About war? About different. I also think about the war. But I believe that it will not take you. With faith nothing can happen to you. With faith and with a little luck. I believe that you will not die. - I almost died? - Oh yeah! For three nights in a row... ... Black camel knelt in front of a tent... He was waiting for you. Have you looked after all this time for me? I did not know how lucky I am. Mabrouk, you know that soon I, may have to leave you. But all those things I said before... I really think so. When it's over, I'll come back. I'll marry you. You do not believe me? Look at me! If you will not kill me, I'll be back. Where is your faith? You are not one of our people. You do not know our customs. Here I can love a man... But this does not mean that I can to marry him. - Who says so? - My father. He will choose the man for whom I get married. And you do not love me, Mabruk? I do not like anyone else. - Then I have to talk to your father. - No! No! - I have to talk to him. - No. Do not be afraid, Mabrouk. In my mind there is no refusal... ... Of race or class. In our faith... ... A brotherhood of men is recognized by the sovereign power of God. It is an honor that my daughter desirable in your eyes. But she was already betrothed to another man . And the marriage contract was already signed. And near the time... ... When we will celebrate the wedding according to our customs. I understand. Sheikh, judging by the sound of to the ruins of the truck rides! - The Germans? - Surely! He says he saw a German truck, which is close to the ruins. Perhaps this - the one chance you've been waiting . - Go? - Yes. - A beautiful day for photos. - Yes, I think the photo will turn out good. Yes, but you must follow the sun. Poor lighting! Very unfortunate. You cope with this, right? The two truck gunner. It must be a trap. - The sun bakes too, is not it? - Yes. Get up here. Come here! Here the wrong place. Come on! Let's try better here. - Interesting area, is not it? - Yes. - Perhaps too sunny. - Hmm. These soldiers lived here once. Yes, perhaps. I suppressed their fire. You go around and throw a grenade. Sheikh Faris. I have no words from such a disgrace. There are people who serve Allah best. If they are revealed to the benefit of, then they blessed. But if the court comes to them, they are giving persons. They lose this one, and the future life. I am ashamed of my people. I'm sorry, he promised his daughter to a man, who insulted us in front of you. The stranger came to our tents. He brought tidings thin. The British army was defeated. Rommel captured the whole of North Africa. All Germans are leaving from here. I have a truck, but... ... I have nowhere to go. Do not lose hope, David. Your people suffered defeat before. But back in the fight with sharpened swords. I'm so scared! I'm sorry! In the name of God the Merciful... ... Who facilitates all our labors... ... Who facilitates our labors... In the name of God the Merciful! Let us thank the Lord for everything. Kind and Compassionate, master of all things. All we worship him and expect his help. Lead us on the path of righteousness, by the fact that you izberesh us. Do not let us fall out of favor or misleading. Ring sim I give his daughter in marriage Mabrouk. I take her as his wife under his care. I promise to defend it completely. All who are present here, become witnesses of this. - Eat, my son. - Thank you! Mabrouk, dear! Yes, you're cheating! Who, Mabruk? I do not know. - Greetings, David! - Greetings, Sheikh Salem! The man brought the news. The British stand at El Alamein. They inflicted a major defeat your opponent... ... Which is now hastily retreating. Please tell me that I am very happy to of the news he brought. I am very grateful for that! Englishman pleased. It is very grateful you. - God be with you the world! - And you peace! Sheikh Salem! I have to talk to you alone. This man came from afar. I located him and will be waiting for you in his tent. What you need to speak with my father ... ... So I did not hear? Mabrouk... If you go, I never see you again. But I have to leave. I can not stay. My friends are still fighting. Do you want me to be a coward? I want only one thing - you to be alive! Mabrouk! Do bring these battles more rain over pastures? Do they bring peace? You do not know which means to love... ... Otherwise you'd never leave me! Dear... Mabrouk... Do you think that I want to leave you ? I have so many reasons now to live ! But the fact and the reason why I have to leave. If I stay, it is only destroy our love. But you - just one person. What can you do alone? I'm not alone. There are many things that distinguish us . But it's your decision, I understand. That's right - you have to go. No one can hope, that his children will live forever. Life, if you know how to use it, can be quite long. You can not always take and not give anything in return. One person can not do much. But with proper help... What's on your mind? Once we have fought together. We could do it again, and with much greater effect. My son, you have given me the honor. It's always nice to know that at least one not think you are too old to fight . My house is your house now. As with my sword. I'm almost finished. - David... - Yes, dear? If you still do not come back... ... What name to give me our son? Why are you so sure that there will be son? Because the old women of the tribe told me... ... But they are always right. What is the name you have chosen for it ? Your name in our language. Then call him "Daud". Oh, David! Do not leave me! Mabrouk, dear... People do not cease to love each other... ... Just because that they leave. I will always love you, David! I told you: I will be back! Yes... Finished his letter. We return to the camp, Ali. But, Colonel! We just left. It does not matter. Mabrouk... What do you want to tell us ? When I was here last time, something you hid from me. I have read pages from the diary, which my brother left in your tent. I know that he married your daughter. And that child whom I saw - their son. I know all this - though no doubt. Ask my father questions. And he will answer! I will do so, as is want my daughter. You and your people have left these tents, together with my brother? Yes. Yes, we went with him. For three days we reached Nomha. Move only at night, hiding in the ravines and valleys in the afternoon. - You will be able to show where is it? - Yes!!! Run for cover! Mabrouk... David died trying to save my life. Many of my men were killed. I managed to escape, only pretending to be dead. Ask for what you want. In the diary of my brother missing page. The most important page. It is still with you? I beg you, if you have it, show it to me ! I beg most humbly! Before it was exactly the same page as this. That brought you a hundred pounds. What I am holding in my hands, something much more powerful. If you will take this note to London... ... It will bring Dawood land and wealth... ... Beyond your calculation. Do you understand what it means to Daoud? We have always understood. That's why I let you out of here in the dark about the fate of your brother. Because you have decided that I want to pick up away from you, and Daud show him a new life? That is our fear. Suppose the child to go to England, to claim his birthright... ... And come back here as soon as possible ? Of course, he could grasp both of our culture. If he finds out about your ideas, whether he will be a place for us? No! It will grow, despising us believing that our life is empty. Is my brother despise you? And because he was familiar with the two worlds. Your brother was a man, and Dowd - just a kid. When a foal gentle neck, it is only there, where to direct the rider. In your country, Daoud would lose the baby. Strangers in a country of his own father. - You could not go to England with him? - No. I can not leave his people. But on the right, all that I possess, belongs Daud. We know that you are aiming not about your welfare. You have to believe that we are pechemsya not our. How can you invest in Daud concepts such as happiness and freedom, if not give him decide? I can not say. But I know that if it stays here, it would be closer to Allah. A, I beg you. Let me tell all the boys. It will not serve for any purpose. You are so afraid that it your lifestyle mean so little... ... That he will throw you if you give him a chance? No, I'm not afraid. Let him talk to Dawood. Let it be so. My daughter will take you there, where you'll find the boy. Mabrouk... You miss much about my brother? David is always with me, to our son. Dowd in the pasture. - Welcome! - Welcome! I saw you were from our tent. You can create fire again? Here, try it yourself. Leave! - Forever? - Yes. Thank you! Why did you decide to give me a gift ? Because your father would like to I did it. You knew my father? Yes. You - from among his people? He was my brother. Look, Daoud. Your father... ... Was a lot of land, money... ... And a beautiful house. All of this is now yours, because you - his son. But they are in England and you must go there, to claim them. The land there is as big as our pastures? Ten times more. Well, the house... It is ten times more than tent your grandfather. I own them? I am alone? Yes. - And there's the sheep on this land? - And more! - A horse? - Little. - A goat? - Yes. - And the camels? - No. No camels? I'm sorry, but no. And there are there be rain? Then pastures are good. Yes. I can promise you, that there are very good pasture. You told this to my mother and my grandfather ? - Yes, she said. - What did they say? What do they want me to do? I do not know. Let's go and find out? Our friend has told you about your father lands? Yes. And he wants to take you to your home country ? Yes. But you have to decide for me. There are some things I I can not decide for you. You - the son of his father, and he wanted to to transfer all this to you. That paper, which says it is. But remember... ... If you go to... ... Your loyalty to his native land will be questioned. And you can not take the place of more than among our people. No one can serve two tribes immediately. So, you have to choose between them . But on my land in England... ... There are a lot of sheep, many goats . Though it is not at all the camels. And there is water, which flows through pastures. Is it not so? So. A residential building has rooms for many people. So, why do not you two go not live there with me? That will not happen. We lived in tents very long time... ... To be able to change our habits . But you're young. You can go to other lands and to be happy. Tell me what I should do. Dowd... I can not. I do not know. We can not help. But how do I know what to say? You should look for the answer in your own heart . Daoud! Allah is merciful! END
