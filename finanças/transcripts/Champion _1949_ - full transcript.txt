And that, ladies and gentleman, as you probably guessed, was the champion entering the stadium. Just about everyone in this vast arena is on his feet. And they're still cheering. No question about it. This is the most popular champion in the history of this division. Listen to this crowd. Actually, they're cheering more than a man tonight. They're cheering a story. A story that could only have been lived in the fight game. The story of a boy who rose from the depths of poverty to become Champion of the World. Come on, give us the money. We know you got it. Get smart, it's only paper. Kerry, take care of the cripple. Come on, jump. Jump! I said jump! Hey, Midge! Are you okay? Are you okay? Yeah! Hey, let's go! - For Pete's sake, Johnny. - What's he difference? We got plenty of room. - Where you goin'? - L.A.? - We're goin' to Kansas City. - Sold. Who won? Huh? Oh! We got rolled in a boxcar. - Kinda rugged being on the road, huh? - We're not tramps! We got a business waiting for us in California. Sure. Well, that's the truth. I'll show you. There it is. That's my buddy. He sold us a third interest in the place. My brother and me. - Well, lotsa luck to you. - Thanks. Well, we oughta hit Kansas City in about an hour. Hey, this is where you're fighting tonight? Yeah, I'm takin' on Romero. He's a pretty good boy. Lotsa luck to you. - Thanks a million. - Yeah, thanks very much. Say, maybe you guys can pick up some eating money here, hustling drinks tonight. Sure, we'll hustle anything. Thanks for the tip. This way, madam. Are you kiddin'? Why should I give you a job? All my boys been around for years. I got no job for strangers. What do you think? You can ride in off the road... - Okay - Okay. Don't get excited. Look out, gimp. Who you callin' gimp? Not tonight, Charlie. What do you mean? He's gotta work tonight. I got a short card. I ain't got no stand-by fight. I'm sorry but that cut'll open the first time Ziggy breathes on it. You're outta your mind. Why, it's nothin'. It's just a scratch. It's more than a scratch. Suppose he loses the eye. I'm not sticking my neck out to the commission for you or anybody else. Hell, what do you want? What do I want? This wise guy busted up six full cases of pop. Don't bother me, I got bigger troubles. Make him pay. - We haven't got any money. - Throw him in the can. Sure, "throw him in the can." All we came in for was a job. Wait a minute. Tough guy, huh? - How much do you weigh, tough guy? - Why? Say you weighed about a 165. Would you like to square this rap and make yourself thirty-five bucks? - How? - Go four rounds with Ziggy Mendoza. He'll take it easy on ya. He'll carry ya. Come on, whaddayasay? Sure. Get this kid a locker and some clothes. Hey, you're crazy. You don't anything about boxing. You'll get your ears knocked off. Listen, for thirty-five bucks, I'd get my head knocked off. Don't know from nothin'. But he can take it. Open your mouth. Ever been in the ring before? One! - Two! - Buckle my shoe. Three! - Four! - Close the door. Five! Hi! - How do you feel? - I think I can eat. At least we get paid. Hey! Fine business you're in. Boy, what a show out there. - Hey, Kelly! - Huh? I'd like to talk to you a minute. My name's Haley, Tommy Haley. Maybe you heard of me. Nh-nh. I saw you fight, if you can call it that. What you don't know would fill a book, but you got guts. If you're willing to learn, I'll manage you. No, thanks. It's not for me. There's an awful lotta money in the fight game. All right, forget it. Maybe you're right. But if you change your mind and you're ever in L.A., you can find me at Bradey's Gym. Sure, sure. L.A. Bradey's Gym? Sure. Hi. Can I get my money now? Why, sure. Here you are. Ten bucks? Where's the rest? Where's my thirty-five? Why, that's it. Ten dollars for your second, five dollars for dressing-room facilities and ten dollars for manager's fees. I haven't got any manager! In this club I manage all unattached fighters. - Now go on. Hit the road. - Oh, you... Okay. Thanks a lot. I'll do the same for you someday. - Business must be good. - Yeah. You won't be needing this anymore. - Are you boys looking for work? - We expect to do our share. You know, we oughta do a little better than this old box. Say, how about that flashy job back in Las Vegas? Sure. Or how about the one where you tell the girl what you wanna hear and she talks back to you. What do you boys want? A little more respect for the owners. If you don't mind. - Where's Bud? - Bud? Yeah. Where is our esteemed partner? Lew! Lew? Ah, the cook! This is really an establishment. Hey, cookie. How about rustlin' up something special for the new bosses, huh? What's the joke? I'm not sellin' this place. What'd you say? You heard me. Look. Me and my brother bought a share in this joint from Bud Tyler a month ago. Get it? - Ah. - Ah. That's different. - Let's see. A month ago, you say? - That's right. That's just about the time I fired him. You know, he's a bigger thief than I gave him credit for. And who owns this place? You do. All right. You'll get room, board and a hundred dollars a month. For the both of ya. There's a place for you to sleep out in the back. And stay away from my daughter. She's only a kid. Nh-nh. You know, I think you're the best dishwasher we ever had. Thank you. I oughta be. My mother taught me at a very early age. Emma. I'm goin' upstairs and lay down for a while. You see that the place gets cleaned up good. Yes, Lew. And don't bother him. He's got plenty to do. You don't bother me. Oh, you mustn't mind Lew. He's got things on his mind. He doesn't bother me, either. Thanks, mister. Lew wants us to clean up. Sure. Well, that's no way. Don't you know how to sweep? Suppose you show me. A big, healthy man like you can't sweep the floor? You have to use elbow grease. Oh! You mean like this? Fresh. You smell pretty good, too. You are fresh. Come over here! I will not. All right. Halfway, then. Well? I just wanted to talk. Do you? Erm... What's there to do around here anyway? Lots of things. Some people think we're lucky being so close to the beach. That's right. Yeah, how about it? You and me after work, huh? I'll teach you how to swim. Oh, come on. How about it, huh? Maybe. I thought maybe you weren't coming. - I had to wait 'til Lew was asleep. - Oh. Well... Shall we get wet? You haven't got a towel. Here, use mine. Nah, I never use 'em. Oh, please. You'll catch cold. Okay. Well, after you. You're just like the... - ...rest of them. - No. - I'm special. - And you're conceited, too, you... It's funny. What? You know, I didn't like you at first. Well, you know, you never smile. And I mean really smile, not just on the outside. You gotta be happy to smile that way. Aren't you happy? Well... Right now I am. Then why don't you smile? - Midge? - Mh-hm? Why aren't you happy? Happy? It's hard to be happy when you're poor. I've been poor all my life. Real poor. You know how it is to be real poor? - Cold-poor? Hungry-poor? - No. Not like that. Listen. When I was four years old, my old man ran away. And my mother couldn't keep me and Connie both, so I went to the orphanage 'til I was old enough to go to work. I used to dream about getting rich someday. Rich enough to hire detectives, find my father, and then I was gonna beat his head off. You know, kids' stuff. Guess we're a lot alike. Well, I mean, my mother ran away, too, when I was small. I used to hate her. But now I think I can understand a lot of things. I don't hate the old man. Maybe he knew what he was doing the way things are. How are they? How are they? It's every man for himself. Nice guys don't make money. That's the way things are. - No, they're not. Not always. - You don't know. I'm gonna get somewhere. Make money. Take care of the old lady. I'm not gonna be a hey-you all my life. I wanna hear people call me Mister. I'm gonna make something of myself. You will. It's getting late. It really is getting late. All right. Do you know the time? Where ya been? - Swimming. - Alone? Listen. Do you want me to fire those boys? Then you keep away from them. From both of 'em. Sneakin' around. You're like your mother. Nh-nh. Hello, baby. - Midge. - Yeah? I feel so sneaky. - When are we gonna tell Lew? - Tell him what? About us. That we're gonna be married. Aren't we? - Aren't we? - Well, I don't know. I never... I wouldn't be able to... We haven't got any money or anything. That'd be bad for both of us. - Bad? - Sure. Aw, honey... This isn't the time for it. I'm not ready for it. Why can't we just go on the way we are, huh? You know how I feel about you, don't you? You little tramp. And you. Oh, Lew, we're gonna be married. That's right. Oh no, we're not. I know what you're thinkin'. Don't try it. The law's on my side. You wouldn't get far. By virtue of the authority vested in me by the state of California. Well, thanks very much, and good luck to the both of you. - Goodnight, all. - Thank you. Midge, I didn't want it this way. Midge. It's starting out bad, but it can be good. I'll make it good. I'll make you happy. I'm leaving. There's nothing you can do about it now. I don't care. I always knew she'd turn out like this. I've done what's right. I don't care what either of you do. Come on, Connie. - Emma, I... - Oh, what are you waitin' for? Midge. Midge! Wait a minute. Look, you're married to her. You can't run out on her. You call that a marriage? It was a frame-up. - The two of them cooked it up. - Midge, you... Listen, I'm tired of being pushed around. Plenty tired of it. You think so much of her, you stay with her. But I'm getting out now. Coming along or not? Okay, Midge. Is Johnny Haley around? Johnny Haley? - You mean Tommy Haley. - Yeah. - Yeah, he's there. Over there somewhere. - Oh, thanks. Hello, Mr. Haley! Oh, sure. Kansas City. How are ya? - How's the eye? - Okay. Well, you're lucky. It's better with two eyes. You told me to look you up, Mr. Haley. Remember? Oh, yeah, yeah. But I'm retired now. Not undefeated, but retired. You want some advice? You do the same. But you told me to look you up. You said you wanted to manage me. Oh, that was then, this is now. Everything changes. I'm out of the fight business. It stinks, no kidding. Take a deep breath. It stinks in here, doesn't it? And it's not sweat. It's no good. - Who are you? - I'm his brother. Well, you look like a smart fella. You don't want him to fight, do you? Well, that's up to him. You go home. What do you mean, go home? I don't need you. You're not the only manager in the world. I'll find somebody else. I'll show ya. What's the matter with you? You got any idea how many times you get hit in the stomach in a four-round bout? You know, the human body wasn't made for the sole benefit of the fight game. You hit a man in the head hard enough and long enough, or just once, and you can either scramble his brains or maybe kill him. And for what? To fill a hall? To win bets for somebody you don't even know? What does it prove? Is that a way to make a living? I've had enough. - Hello, Tommy. - Hello, Rubio. This is the only sport in the world where two guys get paid for doing something they'd be arrested for if they got drunk and did it for nothing. If that's the way you feel about it, what do you hang around here for? Well, with some guys it's the bottle. Me, I like to watch a couple of good boys in action. Here. Pay me back when you get a job. Keep it. Sure, get a job. Soda jerk? Fry cook? Busboy? Ditch digger? Nice, clean, healthy work. Big money. Listen, you told me there was money in the fight game. You take me on, and I'll make plenty for both of us. - You will, huh? - You bet I will. All right. I'll take you on. - Okay. - But get this straight. I'll only handle you as long as I think you can get somewhere. I'm not interested in club fighters or fifty-dollar purses. And you're going to work. You're going to work harder than you've ever worked before. You're going to work until your bones hurt. You're gonna learn how to break the other guy's bones. You're going to learn every dirty trick in the business, and there's plenty of 'em. Come on. Harder. That's when I'm gonna throw you into a ring and see what you can do. Four! Five! Six! Seven! Eight! Nine! Ten! Well... - What do you say? - Well, you did all right. If you overlook the mistakes, which I've not. You be at the gym tomorrow at nine. - Here. You got plenty of work to do. - Okay, boss! It's like pulling teeth to get a kind word from that guy. But I could tell. I could tell from the crowd. I could tell every time I hit him. Yeah. You were great. But you know what I was thinking? I was thinking that now that you proved you could do it, maybe you oughta walk away from it. - You outta your mind? - I don't think so. Then what's eating you? Oh, nothing. Forget it. No, no, no, you got something to say. I know you. And I know you. But I didn't know you up in that ring. You looked as if you wanted to kill that guy. As if you would've killed him if they hadn't stopped you. Is that bad? I don't know. I really don't know. But I kept thinking you weren't just hitting that guy in the ring. I kept thinking you were hitting a lotta guys. Different guys. All the guys that ever hurt you. I can't put my finger on it, but there's... there's something wrong about that. I don't know if that's so good, especially in this business. And if you wanna know, I don't like this business, either. You're talkin' kids' stuff. Crazy stuff! Listen, I wanna fight. My first fight, that's all. Did you hear that crowd? For the first time in my life, people cheering for me! Were you deaf? Didn't you hear 'em? Oh, Connie. Connie, wake up! Smell the coffee. Smell the steaks. Now, I see you're learning, too. That's more like it. Get smart! I got my foot on the ladder. We're not hitch-hiking anymore, we're riding! Uh, it's a tough schedule, but it'll pay off. In Portland, we fight Herbie Baker. A strong boy... with a crockery jaw. In Tacoma, we got Willie Schenker. Good boy... but weak in the stomach. We'll head east. Salt Lake. Denver. Omaha. Tulsa. Dallas. St. Lewis. Kansas City. What goes? What's the idea? I'm gonna have a riot on my hands. You owe me twenty-five bucks. - I owe you twenty-five bucks? - Yeah. Oh. I owe you twenty-five... Why, sure, Midge, yeah. Here, here you go. You'll be able to live a little. Do some of the things you've always wanted to. Do things for your mother. Hey, Ma, what do you think, huh? - Oh, it's beautiful! - Yeah, and it's all for you! There'll be times when it's you that gets hurt and it's you that has to get up off the canvas. But in a couple of years you oughta be getting a rating. I got a wire while you were sleeping. We win this one, we're gonna have a New York fight with Johnny Dunne. - If we want it. - What do you mean, if we want it? Well, he's number one. A lot of people think he's really the king. I don't know if you're ready. Are you crazy? Of course I'm ready. Ready for the main event? Okay. Let's see. Hey, Tommy! What do you think they get for ties in this city? Eighteen bucks! Get a load of this. Here. Get rid of that rag you're wearin' around your neck. - Look, I just came from downtown. - Yeah. The boys gave me a cigar, patted me on the back and told me to drop dead. They say you can't beat Dunne. What do you mean, I can't beat Dunne? You can't beat him. Dunne's been waiting for a crack at the title for years, and he's a big drawer. The champ's an old man, and he's tired. So you lose and Dunne wins and then goes on to grab the title. What? Well, there'll be plenty of work around here, and then in a year or so you'll get a legitimate shot at him. That's the deal. I lose. You mean I toss the fight? Or it's off. That's the way they want it. Who cares what they want? Look, they're the control, they own the business. They don't own me! That's open to question. Listen, Midge, I'm not telling you to do it. But if you don't, they mark us minus, and you'll be fighting in the sticks until your beard is long enough to reach the Rosenbach's. Oh, no. Nobody's rubbing dirt in my face now. I deserve the right to a fair shake. I earn it, I got the lumps to show for it. What kind of a manager are you? What's in it for you? Hold it, Midge. You know what's in it for him. The same as for you. What a kind of a stinking, filthy world. Three years. Work like a slave. Build the muscles, build the win. Live like a monk, beat your brains out, and then the fat-bellies with their big cigars, they tell you you're still a tramp! And I can beat him! You know I can beat him! You're the best fighter I've ever had, Midge. You're a great fighter. But if you wanna stay here, if you wanna stick close to the real money, this one you'll lose. It's up to you. What's it gonna be? I'll lose. Johnny Dunne. He's not doing himself any good running around with that blonde. What's the difference? He's not losing any fights. For what? Well, Kelly, you've come a long way from Kansas City. Yeah. Relax, you'll get your chance next time. All right, boys, let's go. Come on, Johnny. Midge. I suppose you boys know the rules. I want you to watch yourselves on low blows. Let's have a nice, clean break. Now shake hands and come out fighting at the bell. Into your corners. Come on, let's get outta here. - SCHUYLER 78941. - Come on. Ladies and gentlemen! The winner by a knockout... Connie. Go out and get a cab and stay with it and keep the motor runnin' 'til we get there. What's the matter with you? Here. You put these on. You might not even have got time for this now. Why not? - There he is! - Hi, Kelly. When are you gonna fight the champ, Kelly? - I'll take him on anytime. - Oh boy, you're in great shape there. Well, it was a pretty short fight. Don't turn around. Keep walking. Never mind that. Come on. What are you afraid of? I won. Nobody can change that. You think so. That's the way things are now. This is no good. We better split up. Do what I tell you. They're not after me. Get your papers! Read all about it! Boxer beat up by gamblers! Read all about it! Boxer beat up by gamblers! The world of sports has a new hero today. Everyone is talking about Midge Kelly, the fighting machine from the West who refused to knuckle under to anonymous threats and went on in to fight and win. I met Midge Kelly this morning, and I must admit that all my preconceived ideas about prizefighters have been shattered for good and all. He's modest and even a little shy and very handsome in a rugged, masculine way. And, girls, he's unattached and fancy-free, so... We're in. We're on that gravy train, and it's makin' no stops. Oh, look. I know it was a dirty trick on you, guys, but... But it worked out okay, didn't it? Well, I mean... Look. Look, Tom. I didn't do it on purpose. I was all set to play ball, but... I dunno, when I got in that ring, something happened. I... Forget it. When I get on my feet, I'll square things downtown some way. Listen, we don't need them. The papers got me matched against the champ already. You oughta see what they're saying. Hello? Yeah. Well, what's the matter with right now? Okay. If you gentlemen would excuse me... Come in! Hi! Hello, SCHUYLER 78941. Martini? Yeah. - Onion or olive? - Yea-, uh, olive. Thanks. - Sit down. - Thanks. I... hear you caught a double header. Oh, yeah. How do you feel? Fine. - Johnny's in the hospital, you know. - Yeah, I heard. They say you spoiled him. They say he'll never fight anymore. Gee, that's, uh, that's tough. And now you're King of the World. Yeah. Winner takes all, hm? Guess so. I had a lotta time invested in Johnny. You think you can chisel me out of a fortune and then prance over here and try me on like a second-hand suit? SCHUYLER 78941. Crawl outta here! Hey. C'mere, Kelly. Come here. You give up awful easy. I'm expensive. Awful expensive. I didn't want you to think you could buy me cheap. Does it still hurt, doll? So you've got him. What have you got? Newspaper clippings? Words on the radio? A blacklisted fighter? You're backing a horse that'll never run again, Grace. I know. I got it direct. The beef is too heavy. - How heavy? - From what I hear, about 130,000. Would that square it? From my experience money will buy anything. Even forgiveness. Well, Jerry, what're we gonna do? Sit around and think sad thoughts about Johnny? This is an opportunity. I don't lend money to strangers. - He's got a manager. - He's not married to him. He could change managers. I don't think even you could swing it, Grace. Boys like that... Loyalty... It's too sticky. Besides, I'm getting tired of the fight game. I'm thinking seriously of doing a show again. What did you do? Bathe in that stuff? I can remember when you liked it. I've got a lunch date. Well, let's not keep young Mrs. Harris waiting. Oh, look, Jerry. Let's quit fantasy. You like money as much as I do. If I can work it - and I think I can - are you interested? Yes, I'm interested. Go ahead. - Deliver the body. - I'll deliver. Isn't she back yet? No, Mr. Kelly, she isn't. I've been waiting for her. She should be back any minute. Well, do you know where she is? No, Mr. Kelly, I don't. All right. Tell her I called. Again. - Having a little trouble? - All right, wise guy. When am I gonna get a fight? I'll be gettin' gym-happy pretty soon. I don't know. I don't think we can get a preliminary around here. That's crazy. Don't you read what the papers say? The papers don't run the fight business. I figure we oughta head back to the coast. We could work steady around L.A. Listen, I'm not takin' a floater from anybody. Nobody's running me out of town. Well... That's nice to know. Well, where is she? - I'd like to see Miss Diamond. - But she isn't in, Mr. Kelly. Honest. You've been givin' me that for three days. I'll hang around a while. Hello, Kelly. Oh, you're not home. Where are you? Look, I don't like people who lie to me. Don't be mad, Kelly. I'm just tryin' to be nice to you. I told you I was expensive. I like pretty things. You can't afford me anymore. You're unemployed in this town. So why drag it out? - You're dumpin' me, huh? - I drew you the picture, Midge. I asked you to see Harris. I told you he had an in. - But you don't want to be... - I've got a manager! You got an appendix, too, but it'll never make you rich. You're a big boy now. You need spending money. With Harris, you can get everything Johnny was due for. I couldn't do it to Haley. He picked me up off the street. - Besides, I owe him a lot of money. - Grow up! It's either Harris or back to the woods. - And I like it where they've got taxi cabs. - I can't do it. Then get yourself a liquor license and a television set! Look, Midge. It's for your good as well as mine. Will you just go to see Harris? - Just go to see him. - No. It never hurts to talk things over. Especially when there's money involved. Now look, Midge. I'm not trying to sell you anything. You need me more than I need you. But I can do very well with you. That's why I'm interested. Wonderful view, isn't it? The capital of the whole world. It's all yours, if you want it. People look very small down there, don't they? You know, there are only two kinds of people in this world. The big and the little. It's very seldom anyone gets the chance to decide for himself which it's going to be. You're smart, Midge. You're not like the average fighter. You know that someday you're gonna have to pay off for every minute you spent in the ring. What's the windup going to be? Nobody can teach you anything about fighting. Any ex-pug can keep you in shape. But if I take you over, I'll educate your money, I'll put it to work for you. You won't have to fight when you're past your peak. You can quit the game whenever you want. For the rest of your life, people will call you Mister. But it's up to you. You've got to make the decision. So do you want me to sign the check or don't you? Walker says you're gonna get a title fight. - He's right. - He is? - How do you know? - Because I went in and got it, that's how. I didn't feel like going back to the coast. Well, I take my hat off for you. Well, that's not all you take off. I'm thinking you take off too much for the little you can do for me now. 25% is way too much. Do I hear you right? You hear me right. So that's the way it is. Sort of sudden for me. I always thought that we... Well, what isn't too much? - I don't know. - You don't know? You mean there isn't anything that isn't too much, is that it? What about the money you owe me? You'll get it. You'll get everything that's comin' to you. - Thanks. - Hey, did you see what Walker says? - What's the matter? - Nothing. This is a celebration. Midge is getting a shot at the title, and he's got himself a new manager. A blonde. - All right, Haley. - Sure, sure. I'm on my way. What right did I have to expect anything else? I know the racket. I'm too old to believe in fairytales. You know what a Golem is? I think I knew all the time I was building one. But me... I can't keep away from it. I like to watch a good boy in action. You threw him out? I had to do it. I had to sign with Harris. It was our only chance. - How many more years have I got? - You think that excuses it? This man was like a father to you. He fed you, he put shoes on your feet, he made you! And I made plenty for him! Who's been takin' the punches, me or Haley? - Oh, this rotten business. - Aw, lay off the business. It's like any other business. Only here the blood shows. Okay, I threw him out. Connie... You think the world is full of angels? Listen, it's time for you to grow up! Look, you and me and the old lady, that's what's important, nobody else... What's happened to ya? Nothing stands in your way anymore, does it? First Emma, then Johnny Dunne, now Haley. You've got your own way of destroying people, and I don't want any part of it. Well, who's twisting your arm? Thanks, Midge. You've made it easy for me. Okay, go on. Feed yourself for a change. Find yourself a job! Go with Haley! Ugh, take your bleeding heart outta here. It's not that, Midge. It's just that I wouldn't get much sleep at nights, wondering when it was gonna be my turn. Okay. - What'll it be? - Hello, Emma. - I've been looking for you for a long time. - Why? Guess I wanted to talk to ya. - What for? What about? - Emma. Remember me? Best dishwasher you ever had. I'll be through at six o'clock. Yeah, I've had a lot of jobs. Stores. Ran an elevator once. I was even a model for a while. I've got good figure in a bathing suit. Odd. Anyway, I wanted to get away from dirty dishes and glasses. - But here I am. - You never see Lew, huh? No. I heard he got married. He was glad to be rid of me. What do you want, Connie? What did you come here for? You haven't asked me once about Midge. I can read the papers. Why haven't you divorced him? I don't know. You know, there's more loneliness than anything else in the world. It can be lonely in an awful lot of places. Movies. Dance halls. In your own room. People are funny. A little piece of cheap goal can almost make you believe things are different than they really are. What do you want, Connie? Does Midge want a divorce? He can have it! I'm not running Midge's errands anymore. I like you a lot, Emma. I always have. If it had been me instead of Midge, they couldn't have dragged me away from you. But what I came for was to ask you to come home with me. - To Chicago, to my mother's place. - Why? Well, she's gettin' old. She's not well. After all, you're Midge's wife. You... you oughta be there. There's money enough. You're entitled to it. But he doesn't want me. If you want him, it's your only chance. He'll be coming home sooner or later. - Do you really think so? - Sure. We... we've gotta get some weight on you by then. Excuse me. Connie? About what you said, about liking me. I still, I... I mean... - Midge. - I know. Three! Four! Five! Six! Seven! Nice fight, Champ. Johnny, you look fine! - Thanks. I'm back in training. - Oh. Yeah. You're gonna give me a shot at ya, Champ? Sure, kid, sure. Anytime. Goodnight, Champ! We did it, babe! - Oh, you're so rough. - Oh, am I? Palmer, this is Midge Kelly. New middleweight champion. How do you do? How are ya? Palmer? I never heard of that for a girl's name. I'm sorry. I've never danced with a prizefighter before. You know, you're very strong. Oh, I'm sorry. I... I didn't notice I was holdin' you so tight. I didn't mean that. You dance beautifully. Do, uh, all fighters have such wonderful rhythm? I don't know. I never danced with any. What's the matter? Dirt on my face? - Oh, I'm sorry. Was I staring? - Yeah. It's just that I can't quite realize you're the same man I saw in the ring. I suppose you know you have a wonderful body. I'd like to do it in clay. Do it in clay? Yes. A bust or... Perhaps a full-figure statuette might be better. Stat-? You a s-, a sculptor? On a purely amateur basis. Would you pose for me? Talk me into it. Yeah, that's a good build, but... You know, those guys are usually musclebound. - There's no punch. - Of course not. And besides, no one's punch could compare with yours. Hey! You don't want me to pose like that, do you? No. No. - Knockin' off early, huh, Champ? - Yeah. - When do I get that shot? - I told ya. Anytime. Anytime at all. - How much longer? - Just a few more minutes. - I'm getting tired. - Keep your head up. That's what makes me tired. And don't talk. It's very distracting. Why, I wouldn't dream of distracting you. How did you and Harris ever get hook-, uh, I mean, married? Please don't talk. I'll answer your question. My family didn't tell me we lost our money until I was through school. I decided to go on the stage. I met Jerry, married him instead. He worships me, and I like him very much. - Uh-huh. - I've never regretted our marriage. Up to now, you mean. You're very sure of yourself, aren't you? Sure. Suppose I told Jerry. You won't. I think that's enough. Sure. How dare you? Hey. You're real when you're mad. You've been livin' with statues too long. I don't fall in love easily, Midge. I'm going to be serious about this. So am I. Oh! How did you get in here, Gracie? - Thanks for remembering my name. - Ah, don't mention it, Gracie. - Stop calling me that! - Ooh. Say, what are you trying to pull? What do you mean, Gracie? Uh, Grace. You know what I mean. That runaround you've been giving me, that's what I mean. You and Harris' wife, that's what I mean! Oh, is that what you mean? You talk as if we were married. Well, we're going to be. And tomorrow is as good a time as any. Tomorrow! Say, that's dandy. Tomorrow, huh? Well, why not. You got as much chance of marryin' me tomorrow as today. And that's no chance at all, because, uh... Guess what? I'm already married. - You're a liar. - You think so? Well, the next time you're in Chicago, you go to 46 Eagle Street. And if you don't find Mrs. Michael Kelly there, I'll marry you any day you say. I ain't kiddin'. I'm not kiddin' you. You been takin' me for a sucker all this time. Honey, you never asked me if I was married. Anyway, what's the difference? You did all right with me. I'm in hock to Harris up to my ears. Where you goin'? Out. I got a date with a lady. You know what a lady is? Nah, how could you? You know anything about sculpting? You know anything about the opera? Nah, all you know is how to spend money, huh? Well, so long, Gracie. I gotta be goin'. I'm going with you. You're not gonna shake me now. Yes, I am. You dumped me once. Now I'm dumping you. For good. You better promote yourself another meal ticket. Oh no, Midge. Maybe it was that way in the beginning, but not now. Not anymore. It's the first time in my life. Please, Midge. I'll do anything. Why don't you call up Johnny Dunne? All right, big shot, try it. I'll make the biggest stink that's ever smelled in this town. I will... Oh, no. You're gonna be a good little girl. Because if you aren't, I'll put you in the hospital for a long, long time. I gotta change now. Don't be here when I come out. I give you now a gentleman, a sportsman and a fighting champion! Midge Kelly! Thank you, I... I know you're not applauding me but a sport that we all love and that I'm proud to be a part of. It's done a lot for me and... thank you very much. Is it true you're thinking of going to Europe? - You're gonna make that picture? - Well, they never asked me. - How do you keep yourself in shape? - Say, what do you think of that new ruling? - Who are you gonna fight next, Midge? - When are you gonna fight Johnny Dunne? Well, give me a chance. I've defended the title four times this year. - Okay, but what about Dunne? - I'll fight anybody anytime. After all, I'm tired. I just got through fighting a tough steak. From the Belvedere Hotel, you just heard middleweight champion Midge Kelly receive the sporting world's highest honor: the annual Athlete of the Year award. The champion and his manager have left the dais in this year's award... Yes, and you've had enough excitement for one night. You get some rest now. We'll talk about it tomorrow. Maybe he'll be coming home now. I don't think we ought to expect him too soon. I'm afraid he'll be even busier now. He won't be too busy. He's a good boy. - He always was a good boy, wasn't he, Connie? - Sure. Try to get some sleep, Ma. - What's the matter, Emma? - I can't go on lying to her. It's not exactly a lie. He'll be coming home sooner or later. Of course it's a lie. I'm not your mother, Connie. Why, I can't tell you the exact date, but... Connie, please. Don't treat me like a child. What I'm trying to say is that even if he did come home it wouldn't make any difference to any of us. - What does that mean? - You know how I feel? I feel as if I'd been sick for a long time. Now I'm getting well. Maybe it's time that did it. Maybe it's just not being alone anymore. You still love him. You know you do. Do I? I don't think so. Love isn't something you can put on or take off like an overcoat, you know. Is there a law that says I can't grow up? Does tomorrow always have to mean Midge Kelly to me and maybe he'll come home and maybe he won't? Don't you see? It's finally dawned on me that there are other people in the world. Wonderful people. Suppose he... he walked in that door right now. You know, you told me once you weren't running Midge's errands anymore. Maybe that was a lie, too. You've got the same sickness I had. Only you're not over it yet. Wait a minute. I've been waiting a long time. You can't blame me for wanting to be sure. You can be sure. Isn't this... rendezvous rather unusual, Jerry? I suppose so. Even if the circumstances aren't. I wanna have a quiet talk with you. I don't like being considered a fool, Palmer. I've known about you and Kelly for some time. I'm sorry, Jerry. I should have told you, I know. 'Cause it isn't what you think it is. - I wanna marry Midge. - Don't be an idiot. Now, look, Palmer. I'm quite a bit older than you. Maybe that has its good points as well as its bad. Because it gives me a certain amount of understanding. This man isn't for you. Under the flash he's just a bargain-basement item. He could be bought cheap... You think of everything in terms of price tags, don't you? Yes. And I guarantee you're worth far more to me than you are to him. I'd rather not talk about it now, Jerry. But I would. Because I know I'm right, and I want you to know. I think that's Kelly. No, I didn't plan this. Just coming up for another 'advance'. But now that he's here I'd like to prove what I've been saying. Would you like to go int the next room? No, I'll stay here. - Hi, Jerry. - Hi. Palmer! How are ya? Hello, Midge. Oh, you got it ready for me. Swell. Yes, and I've got news for you. I've made a verbal agreement for you to fight Dunne in June. Aw, what's the rush? The way you spend money, you've got to keep fighting. Besides, you owe me quite a lot. I'd like to start getting some of it back. Okay. Goodnight, all. Just a minute. I'd like to talk to you about Palmer. Now, let's not waste each other's time. I want to avoid trouble if I can. I also want to keep her if I can. That's tough, Jerry. Because I want her, too. Shall I tell you what it's worth to me? In dollars and cents? You owe me a lot of money. I'm willing to forget it. I have a contract calling for a third of your earnings. Here it is. Go ahead. Tear it up. You'll be able to keep the whole purse on the Dunne fight. But I want it ended! Right now. - You're kidding. - No. Your end of the Dunne fight'll be sixty-five thousand dollars. Clear. - Sixty-five thous- - And you won't owe me a dime. Midge! - It's a lot of money. - Midge! You're his wife. You're married to him. Aw, I should never have come between you. Uh-huh. See you around, Jerry. Yeah. And I'll give you a tip. What I've been hearing, I'd train for this one, if I were you. Thanks. Shall we go to dinner? - Telegram, champ. - Oh, thanks. Ha, thanks, champ. Tommy! Come on in. You said you had the money you owed me. Yeah. There it is. - That squares us up, doesn't it? - Yup. Wait a minute. I, uh... Well, I got some business to talk with ya. Aw, look, what's passed is past. I want you to get me in shape for the Dunne fight. I'll give you ten percent. You want me to train ya? Why? 'Cause you're the best man in town. Well, you're quite a boy. What's the matter, you're afraid of him? Oh... Well, ten percent isn't enough. How much is enough? Thirty-three and a third. Okay. - See you at the gym at nine tomorrow. - Right. Oh, wait a minute. Not tomorrow, I gotta go out of town. We'll start the first of next week. Whatever you say. Hello, Midge. - Come in. - Hello, Emma. Ma wrote me you were here. - How is she? Is she... - You're too late. Maybe this isn't the time to talk about it, but you might as well know now. Emma is going to divorce you, then we're going to be married. Oh. Well, sure. Sure, you and Emma. Well, I think that's fine! I wish you luck! Thanks. Yeah, that's great. You wouldn't wait 'til after my fight, would you? Why? Connie. I don't blame you for what you think about me. You're right, but... What I mean is, I'd kinda like to make things up. To both of you. I got Tommy back with me. That's the truth. Oh, Connie, would you come back, too, huh? Both of you. Just 'til after my fight. It's going to be a tough one and... Well, maybe my last. I've been thinking of quitting and... Well, anyway... I'd like to have you there. Ma'd want it that way, you know she would. Emma? I... If you want to, Connie. Okay. He looks awful good. I can't tell you how glad I am that you two are together again. I knew he'd wake up one of these days. All right! Time! - So soon? - Yup. You look great today, champ. You think so? Oh, that's the mail. Hey, wait a minute! How about leaving a little? Yeah, but what a left hand. Swiftest left I ever seen. Pass the toast. We're out of milk. I better get some. Comin' at ya. Oh, all packed, huh? Yes, I thought you wanted to be breaking camp today? Aw, just takes me a minute. I didn't bring much stuff. Hey, where's Connie? - He went to town with Tommy to pick up the tickets. - Ah. - How do you feel? - Good. I wish the fight was today instead of tomorrow. Connie says he's never seen you looking better. Hey. Uh... Where are you going for the, uh... for the divorce? Oh, I don't know. We really haven't thought about it much. Reno, maybe. Wait a minute! Why do you always take off every time I come near you? - Do I? - Yeah. You still hate me, don't you? I don't hate you, Midge. I've never hated you. You're afraid of me. You're flattering yourself. - Then kiss me goodbye. - I will not! Afraid? - It's still there, isn't it? - No. No. Please. Leave me alone. You're my wife. Oh, hello, Con. Where you been? I've been lookin' for you all day. You checked out of your hotel. Oh, didn't you get my message? I wanted to be where it was quiet. Emma's gone, Midge. You know why. No. Why? You're no different, you're only worse. Your blood has turned cold. Beat it, Connie. I've got to relax. My number finally came up, too, didn't it? And Emma. Once wasn't enough for ya! You couldn't let her live and be happy, could you? Why did you do it? Because you were bored, did you have to prove to yourself you were really the champion? You stink! You stink from corruption! You're worse than a murderer. You're a grave robber! Let's go! And that, ladies and gentleman, as you probably guessed, was the champion entering the stadium. Just about everyone in this vast arena is on his feet. And they're still cheering. No question about it. This is the most popular champion in the history of this division. Listen to this crowd. Actually, they're cheering more than a man tonight. They're cheering a story. A story that could only have been lived in the fight game. The story of a boy who rose from the depths of poverty to become Champion of the World. When I say 'break', that's just what I mean. In case of a knockdown, walk to your two corners. Shake hands now and come out fighting. Let's have a good fight, come on. Four! Five! Six! Seven! Eight! Let's fight. Should have had him. I hit him with everything but an ax. You watch yourself. You're getting careless. Well, this has been a great fight so far, a real Pier-six brawl, and this jam-packed arena has seen plenty of action tonight. Meanwhile, Johnny Dunne has come back strongly. After hitting the canvas in the first round, he's making a real fight of it. The champion's timing... Oh, there's the bell. And here's Bill Brown again. Thanks, Sam Batton. They come out fast, neither man wasting any time. Oh, there's a cut over Kelly's eye! This may be the break in the fight. Dunne hit Kelly after the bell, but apologized. The champion, however, took it in very good grace. Both of these boys are very fine sportsmen. I can see Tommy Haley now, working feverishly over Kelly's bad eye. The eye, the eye. The eye, Johnny. Keep workin' on it. The tide has definitely turned in this fight. Dunne has taken the last three rounds, in my humble opinion at least, and Kelly, hampered by his closed eye, just can't seem to hurt him. We may be seeing an upset here. He's literally cutting Kelly to pieces now. I've never seen anything quite like it. I don't know what's keeping Kelly on his feet unless it's raw courage, and I mean raw. If this weren't a championship fight, I think it would and should have been stopped long ago. You're through. You can't take any more of this. I'm throwin' in the towel. I'll kill you. I'll kill you if you do. - You wanna stop this, champ? - No. Don't stop it. Please. You can't stop it! What a beatin' he's taken. I think it's all over. Kelly's through! He's all through. He's wholly washed-up. He's finished. We're getting a new champion tonight! Four! Five! Six! Seven! Eight! Nine! Ten! Nobody in! Nobody in. Oh, Connie. We're on our way, Connie. I could tell from the crowd. I could tell... Every time I hear... Sure. Sure, kid. The doc will be here right away. Aw, you're talkin' kids' stuff. Crazy stuff. Listen, I wanna fight. Can you hear that crowd? Gee, for the first time in my life, people cheering for me! Were you deaf? Didn't you hear 'em? We're not hitch-hiking anymore. We're riding. Come on. Listen, Haley. Those fat-bellies with their big cigars are gonna make a monkey outta me. I can beat 'em! You know I can beat 'em! Tommy. Tommy. Midge! I heard about it at the station. How is he? He's dead. Brain hemorrhage. It's a bad time, but... Could you give me a statement about your brother? You want a statement from me, huh? All right. I'll give you a statement. He was a champion. He went out like a champion. He was a credit to the fight game to the very end.
