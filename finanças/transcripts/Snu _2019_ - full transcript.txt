BASED ON A TRUE STORY Francisco S? Carneiro, Prime Minister of Portugal, passed away a little over an hour ago in a plane crash. In the aircraft where S? Carneiro was traveling were also his wife Snu Abecassis, Adelino Amaro da Costa, Minister of Defence, and his wife. Portuguese people... Today, early in the evening, the Prime Minister of Portugal Dr. Francisco S? Carneiro died in a terrible plane crash. His wife Snu Abecassis died in the same accident, as well as the Minister of National Defence, Adelino Amaro da Costa, and his wife, the Head of the Prime Minister's Office, Ant?nio Patr?cio Gouveia, and both aircraft pilots. We still don't know what caused the accident, but it will be investigated in the most rigorous inquiry effective immediately. It is with great dismay and regret that I confirm this dismay news. I ask all of you to remain calm and serene. I repeat. I ask all of you to remain calm and serene. A film by Patr?cia Sequeira Good morning. Yes? Hi! So, who won? The Australian? I expected that already. I had bet on him... We will talk later. Thanks for the news. Kisses. So who won the Nobel? Patrick White. I was right. I said so. I'll tell the reporters. We have to be quick. This Nobel has to be ours. - What's going on? - It's the PIDE. - They're downstairs. - The censorship again. - What do we do? - One thing at a time. Cristina, please bring me the publishing contract we prepared. Virg?nia, call the embassy of Australia for me. What about the PIDE? First, the Nobel. I will deal with the PIDE later. The Pill... Contraception... Abortion... Abortion is a crime, and a serious one at that. You should know that. These are not subjects for books, at least not in this country. Portuguese ladies want to know about knitting... ... needlework, embroidery, or cooking... They don't care about these... these... things. In Sweden and Denmark, family planning has been taught in public schools for years. It is inhumane that women in Portugal still have to suffer and often die out of ignorance. Do you know how many women in Portugal die every year in clandestine abortions or later on as a result from having them? I don't know and I don't care. Well I do... ... and I care. That is why I insist on publishing these books. Be careful, Madam... ... very careful. Things work differently in this country. Do not forget that you are Portuguese by marriage. I never forget who I am. Have a good afternoon. This walking back and forth with the books has to stop, Madam. I agree. It really has to stop. I know you're celebrating, man I'm glad And while I'm away save a carnation for me I wanted to be at the party, man With your people and personally gather A flower from your garden I know there are leagues between us So much sea, so much sea I also know how necessary it is, man To sail, to sail It's Spring there, man Here, I'm sick Send me urgently A whiff of rosemary Freedom. Freedom. It also seems to me that the climate of euphoria, as you said, must be replaced by peaceful and effective action, where on every level and everywhere civil groups and commissions are created to support the council that they may be able to help... ... they may cooperate, act, help the council in the construction and implementation of immediate, short-term measures that are necessary so that life at a national level can go on normally. This cooperation cannot be underestimated, the cooperation of civilians is necessary and urgent... - Hurry back, father. - I will. - Can we go to Barcelos this weekend? - It's a promise. - Chico, are you bringing the pills? - Yes I am. I'll walk with you. - Goodbye children. - Goodbye father. I know you can't come and go every week like before, but... This is the turning point, Isabel. We have a chance for change. We have to grab it with all our might. We must give our best for the country. I am giving my husband. It's all finally happening, don't you see? Now we can build the democracy we've always dreamt of, even if it means sacrifices. I know. - The country needs me. - So do we. Then come with me to Lisbon once and for all. - Oh Chico! This is our home. - We will rent a house there. We will find a good school for the kids. The kids can't spend their time hopping from one side to the other. - Isabel... - Go, don't be late. Take care of yourself. See you soon. We'll always be here, waiting for you. Call when you get there. And why isn't your socialist party called social democrat? After all, you advocate the Nordic countries' regime and they are social democrats! My dear, we advocate democratic socialism. There are several experiences with democratic socialism. The Swedish social democracy is not like the German one. And none of them is like the Austrian, for example. Of course. And that's why socialism in Portugal will also be different. And more advanced than in those societies. And will the Portuguese people want that? It seems to me that the social democratic regime provides workers with the best conditions, more power, more participation. Snu, it's always a pleasure to discuss matters with you. Snu, what about the publisher, do you have any new projects? Yes, we already have some that will be released very soon. In fact, I wanted to tell you about one of them, M?rio. I would like to offer you a challenge. Well tell me, I love challenges, as you know. Dom Quixote would like to make a new collection called "Participate" which intends to be a meeting point of proposals for building a new Portugal. The idea is to make a compilation of some of your interviews and speeches, in order to make the country aware of your political thought. And I would love to publish it, if you are interested, of course. Together with ?lvaro Cunhal and Francisco S? Carneiro. Well, I can't speak for the others, Snu, but for my part, I thank you and I accept your invitation. I like the title you chose, "Participate", and I think it's a fantastic idea. Shall we have a toast? - Cheers. - Cheers. We know that generally speaking, men are predominant in the labour market and in public life. We know that in our country, most women work in offices, in the fields, in factories, schools, at home, but that their work is, in most cases, the most underpaid, most alienated, least interesting, least considered... I have to, Concei??o. Francisco, you can't go, you're not well enough. - The doctor is on his way. - I have to, Concei??o. I have to go. PPD, PPD, PPD... This congress and this party are only possible because there was a democratic revolution in Portugal. The April 25th revolution by the military who, interpreting the feelings of an entire nation, took down the dictatorship that oppressed them and gave them back the right to choose and build their collective future with their own hands. Now with enthusiasm, let's propose to that same people, which is ours, which is the reason for our actions, the construction of the new Portuguese society, in freedom, equality and solidarity. Long live Portugal! Come in. Are you alright, Mrs. Snu? Yes, Virg?nia. Don't worry. I brought the proofs from Dr. ?lvaro Cunhal. Dr. S? Carneiro's original has to be ready by the end of the week. We have to call the PPD. Is the operator also on strike? Yes she is, but I called them myself. Dr. S? Carneiro has left instructions for us to deal with the text selection with Dr. Pedro Roseta. Better send a letter reminding him of the deadlines. Are they all on strike? Almost everyone. You are an excellent boss, Mrs. Snu, nobody would question that, but it seems they are supporting the workers from other companies. And why aren't you, Virg?nia? Why would I go on strike? We've gone through rough times in this company, and you never failed us with a single payment. You always protected us, regardless of our political ideals. Do you remember the day I hired you? Oh, absolutely. You told me: I don't know you, but I'll take a chance. I'm glad I did. Thank you. I am very grateful to you. And you can be sure that I'll never leave you. I know. Now I'll quickly type up a few sentences to pressure the PPD. Excuse me. Did you read the statements from the Fiat guys? They've never sold so many cars in Portugal before. And paid in cash, of course. The way things are, it is safer to keep the money in the garage, than in the bank. Thank you, my dear. Aren't the soldiers and sergeants' meetings enough... Man, those SUV dipshits... Do you want things to go back to the times of fascism, is that it? Democracy is either inclusive or it is nothing but a bourgeois masquerade. Cut the crap, man. It looks like you're in a cultural promotion session, those guys don't even obey Otelo any more, can you believe it? Have you heard about the G3s that were taken from the airport... Yes I have. But the weapons are either kept on the left or this will end up like in Chile. Something else has to be done, dammit. Otelo warned us when that thing at Campo Pequeno happened. They didn't wipe out the fascists, now they're all coming back in a new skin. Do you think we're all going to Cuba to smoke cigars? That's right, my dear, I like to see my bar like this, flowering... It only lacks a rare specimen. - Which one? - ?lvaro Cunhal. He's a very cunning animal, it is a pleasure to discuss matters with him. M?rio Soares is a smarthead, but without him there wouldn't be an Avenue, and no one would resist this wave of militarist nonsense. Now, my handsome friend Francisco... Your friend S? Carneiro is a snob, he is never available. We're editing his book, but we haven't spoken to each other a single time. Oh my beautiful Nordic angel, Francisco has been wrapped in the hideous black lavas of Hades. He was hospitalised in London. Went through a very serious surgery, but it seems he will soon be back to our seven hills, where he belongs. I thought he was from Oporto... He is from Oporto, he is of the world... He is from Olympus, actually. Today I am pleased to announce, that finding myself recovered, I yesterday reported to the President of Congress and the PPD Council, that I am able to resume my position as Secretary-General of the Party, for which I was elected for two years in our first congress. In Portugal we can't officially be anti-communist, but it seems we have to be officially anti-social democrat. This is deeply wrong, and it is contrary to the exemption, pluralism and respect for democracy that must be required from civil and military authorities. PPD advocates social democracy for Portugal, it is not only a path to socialism but, at the same time, the socialism that is possible at any given time according to the choices the people make with their votes. For us, the socialist society to achieve is the one where each of us is fulfilled completely and freely, abolished the conditions of alienation, exploitation and oppression of the human being. Doctor S? Carneiro! I'm sorry. Can I ask you to sign the book? Of course. So? Did you like the book? I liked it so much that my son is going to be called Francisco. I'm very flattered. Best wishes to you and your family. I'm glad you're back. We really need you. Dom Quixote has published two books for me, and I find it very rude of me that I don't personally know our publisher. Snu! What is she like? Maybe it would be better if you didn't know. Why? Snu is a sleeping beauty in an ice skiff waiting for the kiss of fire. Only it can melt the glacial enclosure that hides away the soul that fits your own, as if it were hot wax. To you, her Prince Charming. Me! Why me? I didn't picture you so tall. - I didn't picture you so... so... - So short? No. I didn't picture you... There are words I still can't say in Portuguese. Thank you. Finally. It was about time I met the publisher of my books. Do you know this restaurant? It's very good. It has an absolutely marvelous partridge. Yes, I already knew this restaurant. Not the partridge. But you appreciate good Portuguese cuisine? I confess that I find it a little heavy. Right... - Wine? - No, thank you. Is Snu a Swedish or a Danish name? You know, that is not my name. My name is Ebba. Ebba? Ebba. I inherited it from my maternal grandmother. At home they called me Snu, so it became my name. At fifteen I signed my passport as Snu. Did they call you Snu for any special reason? Snu means clever. Clever? I think so. But tell me. Why did you invite me to lunch? Well, I think this meeting should have happened a long time ago... In fact, this is the second of my books you publish... She is brilliant, she's a fantastic person. Very educated, very calm, with an extraordinary intelligence. I must see her again. Urgently. Mrs. Snu! I had never heard you sing. Me neither, Virg?nia. Funny... Did you have lunch with our elusive author? - It seems so, finally. - And what is he like? Surprising. Today I want the world The way a trapeze artist will fall Opening another flower in our mud Ask him for a jump And take away his track... - So you left York House? - Yes. So? I rented a house in Restelo, I was getting tired of hotels. Finally my brother gets some sense! I don't understand how you can take this constant commuting between Lisbon and Oporto, Chico. I'm hanging in there... I have no other choice. Well, at least now you have a home. And Isabel? It seems clear to me that Isabel won't be coming. You should have figured that out a long time ago. She has her reasons. The kids' cousins, grandparents and school are there in Oporto. And Isabel never really liked Lisbon, she doesn't feel well here, what do you want? What she doesn't like is sharing you. And politics is a very complicated rival... ... to reflect my biography. Are you expecting someone? Maybe I am... What's going on, Chico? I'm not sure. But I'll tell you when I know. Ready? I have to be... You have never accepted invitations to go to embassies and now you do and you make me come with you! They'll think we're having an affair... I promise I won't ruin your reputation. There's the Ambassador. And here is my author... How are you Snu? It is a pleasure seeing you again. This is Vasco, my husband. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. Concei??o Monteiro, who works with me, was kind enough to accompany me. How are you? - It is a pleasure to meet you. - The pleasure is mine. How are you? - Hey Vasco? - Ah, what a nice surprise. Please excuse me. I'm going to get some drinks. Excuse me. Thank you. I didn't expect to find you here. To tell you the truth, I also didn't expect to find myself here... I'm glad you came. And was it worth it or do you regret it already? Now that I've seen you, it was certainly worthwhile. I have to confess something to you. I imagined the publisher of Dom Quixote to be a very serious Nordic lady, and of a certain age. - You thought I was a little old lady? - Yes. Imagine my surprise when I saw you. But I am Nordic and I am very serious. You have to pay us a visit at the publishers. How about tomorrow? I'm sorry to interrupt, now it would be appropriate to greet the Ambassador. - It was a privilege meeting you. - The privilege was mine, thank you. - See you soon. - See you soon. Now even the Russians are speaking about the violence in Portugal and the dead in Cust?ias... One was German. Do they already know what the German was doing near the prison? The most important thing would be to know why Carlucci has lunch with Soares so often? Getting rid of Chico. Don't you know what the Americans think of him? - It's a possibility. - It seems so. If need be, Soares will bet on Freitas. It makes sense. They'll unite and push us to the sidelines. But Chico believes we will win the elections. Isn't that right Chico? Chico? Chico? Chico? Gentlemen, if you'll excuse me you'll have to go on without me. But did you arrange something specifically? No, Concei??o. But I have to go there immediately. What if Mrs. Snu is not there, or what if she can't see us? - Or it might not be convenient... - It's urgent, Concei??o, it's urgent! Is that really him? I know it is! He said good morning to me. Oh my... he's no Cunhal, but he has a gaze that one can never forget. Oh girls he is so hot! It's like those houses that were closed down for a long time, we have to open the doors and windows and let in the fresh air. Portugal needs to dialogue with the world, we must inform, reform, show the pathways. And that's what we are trying to do here at the publishers. I don't have much time to read, but I follow the D. Quixote's notebooks, of course. The idea of compiling articles published in international press was... greatly controversial, it really was. It's important to have critical thinking. You are an admirer of Mafalda, I see. You both want to change the world. I'm less non-conf... non-conf... Non-conformist. Non-conformist, thank you. I don't propose to so much, I would already be satisfied with changing Portugal, or participating in the change. And speaking of which, I am sure you have urgent matters to attend to. I would listen to you forever but we'll let you work, isn't that right, Concei??o? It was an enormous pleasure talking to you, Snu. The pleasure was all mine, Concei??o. Have dinner with me tonight. Here's my address. I'll be waiting for you. Hello? Hello Isabel. I hope you didn't take my invitation and my urgency to see you in the wrong way. But I'm afraid that time might run out. Please accept my apologies. Francisco. Good morning. I would like to send a telegram with the following message: I would like to repay the invitation, tomorrow, eight pm, Rua Dom Jo?o V... Dear Francisco, how are you? Welcome to our home. - Good evening. - Good evening. Your hands are freezing. It's cold outside? Very. Nothing you can't forget when entering this magnificent house. Will you have something to drink? I'll take a whiskey, thank you very much. A few years ago I was in a serious accident with my brother Ricardo. For a few days I was in-between life and death. Maybe that is why I want to live so fast. I'm sorry if I scared you. I'm scared of... the irreversible, the unforeseen, the mess. That's exactly what fascinates me... ... the unexpected. What holds a Nordic woman to this messy country? The desire to help changing it. Won't you come with me to the party? Dom Quixote needs me. I do too. I need to see you more often. I find you unique. Like in the poem by S? Carneiro. M?rio, of course. I must have read it, but I don't remember. Do you like poetry? Not particularly. But I wish I had written that poem for you. "Oh how I wanted you Ali in violets And satin fleece... "Your long ivory fingers Shaded by black jewels... "And so feverish and delicate That you couldn't take a step "Dreaming of stars "Distressed With colored prints on your lap... "I wanted you naked and cold Snuggling in sables "Drowsy Blushed from ether and morphines... "Ah Were your nostalgias silver bells "Your frenzies, sequins "And the idleness in which you wither Moonlight that is wasted... "Your kisses I wanted them out of tulle "Running through in carmine "Your spasms of silk... "Cold and clear water in a blue night "Water Should be your love for me..." The buzz is spreading, at a frightening speed. There is already a rumor spreading that the S? Carneiro that has an affair with Snu, is Ricardo and not Francisco. Let's see if it sticks. But the truth will eventually be known, sooner or later. This is a bomb that will explode on top of PPD. If this comes out... I don't even want to imagine! We have to protect Chico. Protect ourselves. Let's talk to him, calmly. Calm and Francisco, now there's a difficult combination. I'm sorry, but I won't give you the right to intrude in my privacy. It's not just your private life. The man who is head of PPD, who is the face of the party, cannot be married and have an extramarital affair. I do not allow discussions on this subject. I do not allow it from you, or anyone else. I refuse to have my private life the subject of public discussion. But even if you don't want to, your situation may become public. We are not here to judge you, we're here to protect you. This is a scandal, Francisco. A scandal that will shake the party's reputation. Is it serious? Are you really going to divorce Isabel? You know me Ricardo. I won't be able to live a story this big in secret. I won't taint it with lies and hypocrisy. Chico... This love is greater than me, and I want to live it in truth. Have you thought about the consequences of that? On the kids, our family, the party, your career? And on the Church...! I have done nothing else but think about all that. It is irreversible. Chico, I don't recognise you. You're completely insane. No way, I still believe in this marriage. I don't want to give up, I refuse to. You were the one who taught me to fight for what I believe in. Isabel, our marriage has been dead for a long time, you know that as well as I do. And the kids, Chico. Have you thought about them? We can't go on with a farce because of them. That is the worst example we can give them. And destroying a family, is that right? What is right is for each of us to be able to go our own way and try to be happy. There's someone else, isn't there? Yes, there is. I don't want to lie to you, Isabel. And who is she, may I know? I'm sorry, but I won't tell you that. Are you in love? Yes. And that's why I need you to give me the divorce. Don't even think about it. I still love you. You're being stubborn and irrational. Stubborn and irrational? You don't want to tell me who she is, the one you say you love now. So then tell me, if you can. Who was with you when you received the last rites? Who supported you through the bad times? And there were so many, and so bad. Who? Isabel... Who gave birth, one by one, to your five children? Who prayed by your side when you buried your brothers? Was it on her finger, before the altar, that you placed this ring, nineteen years ago? No, it was not. I swore I would stay with you until death did us part. And you can be sure that while I live I will not give you the divorce! What's going on, father? You were arguing, I heard it. I asked your mother for the divorce. You are leaving mother? You will leave us after all this time? Francisco, things are more complicated than what they seem. I met someone else, and I'm not going to fool your mother. We always wanted to be a good example for you... Father, I'm sorry but what example are you trying to give us now? - I hope it's an example of honesty. - Honesty? So many lectures about morality and ethics, for this? What kind of ethics is this that makes you leave your wife and children, separating your family, just because you met another person? Ethics is living up to what happens to us. I didn't choose to love someone else like this. But it happened. And I will not spend the rest of my life pretending, son. Father, forgive me. I love you very much, but if you leave this house, for me it's as if you died. I hope someday you'll understand me. And on that day I will be waiting for you with open arms. Snu. Vasco already took care of the divorce papers. Everything is in order. Have you spoken to Isabel? I have. But she doesn't want to give me the divorce. We have to give her more time. I don't understand. If she's not with you, why does she want to hold you? Isabel won't accept to see the family destroyed. My love, we knew it wouldn't be easy. When my mother met my stepfather they were married too. He had five children, she had three, like us. Tor was a fantastic stepfather, a very important man in my life. My parents always stayed friends, things don't have to be complicated. You're right. But Portugal is not Denmark, Snu. Mentalities take time to change. And we're going to wait for them to change? I want to be alone. - Good morning Virg?nia. - Good morning sir. - Where is Snu? - Mrs. Snu isn't here. - Do you know where she went? - I don't know. She is not home, and... She is not here. - Please, tell me where she is. - I'm sorry, but I can't help you. I really don't know. I know you know where she is. Teresa, please tell me. I already told you. She left and I don't know when she will be back. Then I'll wait. Please don't do that. Did you want to run from me? No. I don't want to run away from you, but I can't live like this. I didn't want you to suffer because of me. I know. I love you, and I want to live with you for the rest of my life. Tell me what you didn't tell me when you met me. What do you mean? You said... I didn't picture you so... ... and you didn't finish the sentence. Because I couldn't find the right word. Have you found it yet? Magnetic. But also... charming... ... alluring... ... irresistible... After we had lunch, I immediately checked the dictionaries. They often call me sullen, irascible, cocky, snob... Oh no, but you are a little snob. Really, clever girl? - That's not fair. - All is fair in love and war. I'm so embarrassed. Everyone is looking at us. That's because you are the most beautiful woman in the world. Not the world, the universe. Will you marry me? You may come in. I see that the surgery didn't take away your sense of humor, I'm glad. I'll go talk to the doctor. I was so afraid of losing you. You won't lose me. We still have a lot to live for together. Yes, I know... ... but the important thing now is that you rest. How do you feel? Unkempt. I already said you aren't. Mother, but I'll have to go to Lisbon with the school. And you'll go with the school wherever the others go. - You're not going anywhere else. - Why can't I go see father? As long as your father lives in that house, there's no way. Mother please, I just want to see father. I miss him so much. Little girl, you know that your father doesn't live alone. But I can go there, I'll greet Snu and I'll go out just with father. Do I need to say it again? You are forbidden to meet that woman. Are we clear? Mother. Tell me. I too want to go and see father in Lisbon. Oh really? Then pack your bag and stay there. Don't go. I have to. I want to be with father. Be beside him. I want to go to Lisbon. Important things are happening! And you should come too! I don't know if I have the courage. We're in Europe, we want to be part of the European Economic Community. Not by geographic imperative, but by national determination, by our constructed and explicit will, through an economic regime compatible with freedom, an economic regime compatible with freedom, which, right now, is, in fact, being questioned. Freedom is currently the border between those who stand up for... Father... It's so nice that you came. I will raise you again. I really want you to meet Snu. Victory, victory, victory... AD, AD, AD... AD, AD, AD... Victory, victory, victory! Victory, victory, victory... - Long live Portugal! - Long live! Long live AD! AD, AD, AD.... - Concei??o, where is Snu? - Back there. Go get her please. AD, AD, AD... And what do we see today? This colossal protest, reaffirming confidence in politicians and in the parties who knew, know and will know how to understand each other. That's the Swedish woman who is with S? Carneiro. The rebirth of a new hope for the future of our Country. This is the Democratic Alliance. And what do we want? We want a system for the people and not the people for a system, as has happened so far. - Long live Portugal! - Long live! AD, AD... This is a matter of some significance which I find difficult to address, but it's important that I do so, before it's too late. May I count on your utmost discretion and honesty? - Absolutely, yes. - Yes, yes. As you know, my relationship with Snu Abecassis is not a passing adventure. I consider Snu my wife whom I intend to marry as soon as the civil code allows us to. I know that it certainly won't be accepted by everyone, especially at the basis of our parties. Please tell me, in consciousness, if you consider that my relationship with Snu may be a hindrance to me being Prime Minister. Francisco, I don't think your personal condition will conflict with any political condition. I think exactly the same way. In fact, for me and for the PPM you are already AD's candidate for Prime Minister. I want to clarify that, if my situation is considered incompatible with my duties, I will choose the woman I love. Thank you. We won... We won. Victory, victory... We did it. If green and red Are the colours of our flag Oh, the nation will end If the booze runs out This one is on the house because today we're celebrating. Everybody is so happy. How wonderful... A toast to the Nordic princess and to the fearless knight, who furiously, between the howls and roars of the puritan, opened the path to the great social change in this pressed country. You, my dears, you are the biggest revolution that has happened in Portugal since April 25th. Victory, victory, victory... Will you do me the honor of this dance? With pleasure, Mr. Prime Minister. A black man with blond hair or a white man with an Afro isn't natural. What's natural and looks good is each one using the hair they were born with. Using Olex Restorer every day gives your hair... Here at home there are... ... no big reasons for concern. Z? no longer has a fever... ... and the others are in good health. Their grades... ... have been good. Little Isabel... ... is still saying... ... she wants... ... to study abroad. Francisco. We are a matter for discussion in "Time" magazine. An article with a picture and everything. S? Carneiro defies the conventions of the Catholic Church? But this... this is, it's unacceptable! But now we're at the point of personal attacks! An excuse for Eanes to invite another leader for Prime Minister. This must have been ordered. How does an article like this come out and no one tries to reach out to you? I'm going to the Party right away. As you may know, some time ago Francisco asked me for the divorce and I refused. I was approached by his lawyer yesterday and I've been told that the proceedings are being handled by you, Bishop. Yes, it is true. I'm aware of the importance that Francisco's intervention has had on your return from exile, and I was a little afraid that now you might feel obligated to help him. Oh Isabel, I was very grateful to Francisco for what he did, I will not forget it, but I also don't mix things. A delegation from the PPD has already come here to ask me to intervene with you, to convince you to grant him the divorce, and I refused. I am very grateful to you, D. Ant?nio. I've known Francisco for a long time, he is not well, he can't be. But he will pull himself together, sooner or later. You must be patient, and have faith in God, my child. Yes, I know, Bishop. And I do. The divorce papers are in my drawer and they won't get out of there. I don't even know how to thank you. You have nothing to thank for. Go in peace and may God be with you. I arrived in Portugal in 1962, and I had never known such a backward and poor country without freedom. I was 21 and had a head full of projects for the future. I spoke Portuguese badly... Virg?nia can confirm this. The publishing house was the way I found to express myself. And it seemed like the best way to give people hope and information. This is how this family was born in 1965. Our Dom Quixote is now 15 years old. Thank you. Thank you for helping me make this dream a reality. I wish you all a good Easter. To sum up, I want you to search the garden for your chocolate eggs. Ah, I found it! Nice! I found it, I found it. It's mine, it's mine! Mrs. Snu! Ah, I found it. I found it. - These are for you. - Thank you. I LOVE YOU. HAVE A HAPPY DAY, FRANCISCO. Excuse me. Snu... Snu... Aren't you coming to the wives' program? The wives' program? Yes. We're going for a walk, to visit St. George's Castle... - Weren't you invited? - No... No? - Give me a second. - Mis?... Manuela. You didn't invite Snu? Well, personally I could have considered inviting her, but this isn't a personal invitation, you know that these diplomatic visits obey state protocol that is beyond me. It wouldn't be correct for the President's wife to invite Snu when S? Carneiro is still married with Isabel, you understand... In that case, Manuela, don't get me wrong but if Snu isn't going, I'm not going either. "The next morning she was asked if she had slept well. "Oh very badly, very badly, said the girl. "I hardly slept all night, only God knows what was in my bed. "I was lying on such a hard thing that my body got covered in bruises! "It was horrible. "So then, they concluded that she was a real princess "because she had felt the pea through twenty mattresses "and twenty fluffy duvets. "Only a real princess could be... so sensitive." Captain Sousa e Castro declares open war on the Government, confirming in an interview that, and I quote: "As a Prime Minister we have a man that, "being legally married to a lady with whom he has several children, "imposes another woman, with whom he lives, "in state protocol ceremonies. "A Prime Minister who does something like that "loses all moral credibility, "because he insults values that are very dear to the Portuguese people. "We also condemn the silence of the Church... The best thing to circumvent this situation would be to act before the presidential elections. You just have to submit a bill, reduce the divorce period from six to three years. Since you've been separated for more than three years, this would allow you to divorce Isabel immediately and marry Snu. I understand and appreciate your intention, which I'm sure is good, but the answer is no. - But why Francisco? - That is out of the question. I will not propose an amendment to the country's general law to benefit me, to solve my personal problem. But it is a perfectly legal change, and it would solve the problem. You know that without this divorce your application for the Presidency of the Republic is political suicide. You know what? I like politics too much to run for the Presidency of the Republic. I am structurally anti-presidential and I always thought that in democracy politics should have its reason and goals in the Parliament. We'll have to find another candidate. There is nothing else to talk about this. Thank you Concei??o. How did you guess? I told them. I told them that you would never accept such a proposal. Have you heard what Soares said at the rally in the Algarve? I've heard. They were very close friends. Snu was devastated. Hello Snu. Snu. What's wrong? We are friends. Don't refuse a handshake from me! You agreed to run a campaign of insults, I can't give you a handshake. But Snu, honestly I don't understand. "How will a man who cannot rule his own home "intend to rule an entire country?" Those are your words... ... words that hurt me deeply. You betrayed our friendship and I can't forgive you for that. I asked the Government why there was no one at the London airport waiting for the Portuguese Prime Minister? It has transpired, in reputable diplomatic circles in Lisbon, the possible existence of problems of delicate nature concerning protocols. Which, therefore, enables us to legitimately ask whether protocol issues have actually been raised, what kinds of protocol issues were raised and by whom were they raised? I'm tired of them using my relationship with Snu as a political weapon. You've made a choice that I fully respect, but you can't be surprised by these attacks. But they don't have the right to intrude in my private life! You are right Francisco, but you were the first one to bring Snu into the public life. I don't know if Portugal deserves us. What a horrible thought. Only slander and defamation, I'm sick of it. They set up a campaign to discredit me and the government. It is written on the walls and in all the papers that I owe money to the bank, now even the "Expresso" speaks of the 33 thousand contos. You filed a lawsuit in the courts, there is no better way to prove your innocence. It's like you say, the truth always comes up. - The truth always comes out. - Right, comes out. And this lack of seriousness from your opponents only shows that they aren't an alternative, that they don't have concrete proposals, they don't care about the real problems of the Portuguese people. They only care about attacks to institutions and people. - Times are hard, Snu. - That is why... ... people need you. And I need a majority government and a president. I know you think that Soares Carneiro has no charisma. And I admit that he may not be a good candidate, but he will surely be a good president. I trust you. And I admire you because you are more concerned about the next generation, than the next elections. Don't give up. You can't give up now. I also speak to those voters who will now vote for Soares Carneiro to achieve this fundamental goal. The fundamental goal of our generation, the generation of those who are in the labour force that will ensure the future of the young, stability and safety for housewives, that will ensure social stability for us all and the elderly. I firmly believe, today more than ever, that on December 7th we will elect General Soares Carneiro, not only on behalf of the Democratic Alliance, but also for Portugal. Cut. Was it good? But I would like to do it again, less softly, more urgently. Then we'll choose the best one. It's already so late. And you still have to stop by your house. But what time is the flight? Do you know that you're no longer flying with TAP, Snu? What's wrong? Francisco prefers to go with Adelino Amaro da Costa on the campaign plane, so you can still go to Escondidinho for dinner. I don't like those little planes at all, Concei??o. In any case, I did not cancel the reservations for TAP. Do you know what I really feel like, Concei??o? Sleeping. It's the last trip. After that, you can rest. Are we ready? In five, four... Are you tired? Yes... a little. It's almost over. I spoke to my mother. She is worried. I told her we gave our best for the victory. We haven't given everything yet, but soon... everything will be decided. It's all or nothing. And if we don't win the elections? We'll buy a house in Alentejo and plant oaks until we get old. I thought I was already old... Clever girl. I love you... At 8:17 pm on December 4th, 1980, the aircraft carrying Francisco S? Carneiro and Snu Abecassis took off from the Lisbon airport and, seconds later, crashed in Camarate.
