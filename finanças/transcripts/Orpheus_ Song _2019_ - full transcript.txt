JOBCENTER Do you know what they want? They want you to show up for an appointment. Shit, man... When? - Well: "promptly"! - Immediately, or what? Sounds like it! Come in! - Good morning! - Good morning! Please take a seat! Tell me something about yourself! Well... I can currently bench-press 110 kilos, four repititions, but I want to work up to 120 kilos. And why have you applied here? I didn't apply here! And why are you sitting here now? As if they would ask some shit like that, man... No, they will say "Thank you for your time" and "send in the next person!" - This could work. - You think? White is a little straitlaced, no? Sorry, that's all... A little wrinkled, but... looks good on you! Here it is. Good luck! Will you stay? I'm only going briefly to the park, Kristina is taking a few pictures there. Ok. See ya later! See you! Very nice! The last time you saw him was four weeks ago. You miss him. Yeah, a little more yearningly and crazier. Oh yes, very good I like that! Now, a little more timidly. Push the hair back. Wind please... wind! Very nice! I love it! Perfect! Reflector, now wind please! You're scared, but you are still excited. - You understand? - Yes! Run, Europa, run! If you get jealous, I'll leave you! Then leave me! And... how did it go? Man, like shit! They didn't hire you? Worse! They did! Great! Who do I have to thank for this shit? - Yourself, man! - No, you! - Should we go work out? - Lower body, right? Right! Damn, I hate leg day! I didn't take my booster today. By the way, I'm going to pick up some supplements at the "power store"... should I order some for you? Yeah, do that! - Hey, I won a trip to Greece. - Yeah, right. Look at this... Phony, no? Probably! Here, push on this! Dear Mr. Mankowski... Congratulations, you're a winner. Your prize is a one week trip to Greece for two. Please confirm your trip within 24 hours. Don't open it! You know what, just recently I really did enter a contest. Show me that! There's a telephone number. Call it before you open the envelope. Yes, hello, this is Philipp Mankowski. I have just received a letter which says that I have supposedly won a trip to Greece. Mankowski... N K O W S K I I already received it. Yes, I think so... Yes, I actually already know... His name is Enis Beckmann. No way man. I can't go with you! Yes, perfect. I'll send you everything... Thank you and goodbye. Bro, I can't! Partner!? What the hell was she talking about!? I'm in the middle of cramming for exams. Don't you start your job next week? Or the week after... - Come on, you need to cancel! - No way man, I already accepted! A week in Greece with my "Hombre". How long since you had a vacation? Who knows, a long time! I can't leave, right now! Look, how sweet! - I'm taking a leak. - Do that! - It's really cool here, don't you think? - Yeah, awesome! - Great, or great? - Very great! Fleeing from the Colchians, Jason and the Argonauts reached the island of Corfu where they sought refuge from the Cyclops, the monsters... and other dangers that the gods had sent to persue them. Can you take a photo? Top! You're a good talker, aren't you? If you weren't constantly babbling on, probably. Man, you would be an awesome salesman! The Achilleon was built by Elisabeth, the Empress of Austria, between 1890-1892. In the middle of the palace we find a statue of the dying Achilles with which the sad empress became enthralled during an art exhibition in Vienna. You want to go there, or what? - That sounds extremely boring man! - Listen to this! In this illustration we see Achilles mourning the loss of this friend Patroclus, who died in the battle for Troy. What we do not see in this illustration is the advice from his mother Thetis: to console himself for the loss of his lover through alcohol and sex... Almost unimaginable even today. Hey there! We can see how much Christianity has shaped our thinking, even up to today. So... another coffee and then we'll go? - Alright. - Black or Capuccino? Black! This is where they filmed James Bond! Is there WiFi here? I'm not getting any connection. Enis, come sit next to me! - You need a job! - Do I? When we're back in Berlin I'm going to open a supplement store and I need a sales person. Then I wish you luck in your search! - I already have someone! - That's why I'm studying? Please don't turn around! - Yo, she has come down only because of me. - Yeah, for sure! Sure as shit she's going to the beach bar. Come on, drinks on me! No way man. I'm way too tired, I'm hitting the sack! I?ve only got 10 Euros on me, can you lend me a twenty? If you get slapped in the face, I'm not going to comfort you! I'll bet you will?! Leave my wife alone! What's going on here? Who's the bozo? Jesus! Dude, I'll beat his ass! Yo, where are you going? Hey, hey... Where? ENJOY YOUR DAY - Hey bro, everything cool? Can we go? - No wait a minute... Let's have a coffee! - Wait just a minute! - She is gone, so we can forget about... We'll just go to the newspaper stand and drink a coffee. This guy is giving me shit! That's what's going down, this jerk wants to throw us out of here?! Bro, this island is big! All kinds of awesome stuff! Even has a golf course! But that doesn't interest me... Look at this, that path looks nice! There's a small, old village! Very Greek. "Paleokastritsa..." Man!!! There is a small beach, we can chill out there... and here, if we then... continue along this way, then we can get back here quickly. Should we take off now? Or do you want to go to the doctor first? I thought that you didn't want to look after me any more? - The way down is to the right! - Are you sure? - What's up? - Wait a minute. - Is everything OK? - All of sudden I'm feeling really bad! Let's sit down for a minute! Here, sit down there! Should we go back to the hotel? Why? You ran out of steam, or what? You pussy. Man, you're a real macho! That's what all my girlfriends always tell me! What's that supposed to mean? That means you need to hand me the damn water. Yuck. This shit is boiling hot! Let?s go on! I'm good to go again! - Do you think anyone's here? - I don't think so! Let's keep going. - What's this called again? Paleo... - Paleokastritsa! - It'll be dark soon, no. - Hmmm. That happens fast here! Isn't this the village where everyone disappeared? And nobody knows why? Bullshit! Look over there! We can sleep here! Damn, what kind of creature is that? I have no clue! Are you asleep, or what? I'm talking to you! Never heard anything like that. So... quiet now! Get up! Why? Because we are going now! Oh, really? Yeah. Should I leave you some water? I'm coming already, you pain in the ass! We have to go down there! - Fire up the GPS. - No can do. - See, no reception. - What!? Try again. It's not working! - My mobile is also not working. - What!? The time is wrong! - Maybe it is 11. - No way. It already was. Look at your mobile, please! And what time is it? 11:27. Maybe it is only the reception... - How far is it to the next village? - Not far now. If we go down there to the right... that must be the village. Here?! I don't see anything! Can't you read a map?! Then you read it! Be careful that you don't wreck the map! You really think you have the slightest chance against me, you jerk? Hey! Yeah you! Do you know this area? Hercules? Is he gone? Looks like it! - It's yours, isn't it? - Yeah. Shit! The money is gone! Come on, let's keep going! Nymph!! Nymph!! It's me, Poseidon! Man is it cold! - And how far is it now? - Not much further! Feels like the closer we get to the town, the further away it gets. I feel like having a pomegranate! - What are you doing? - I'm eating a pomegranate. Are you really waiting if something happens to me, before you eat that pomegranate? Here, wash it down! Fruit for breakfast is healthy! Tastes good! Bewitched fruit with alcohol. You know what?! We'll never get to that damn village! Bullshit! This island is a labyrinth! - A trap! - Stop talking nonsense! - Who's telling the truth? - Not you! Children and drunks! We're going to die here tonight, anyway! Tonight some kind of sea monsters, cyclops... fucking Greek gods are going to get us for sure! But you know what? I'm ready! See, Poseidon already has the hots for me! Hey Poseidon, I brought you a lover from Germany! And now? Fuck off, man! - Say, "fuck off" again! - Fuck off! Get up, now! Our flight is leaving soon! Why are you giving me so much grief, man? Come on, the hotel is just ahead. I can see it from here. All that stress for nothing at all! Now we're just hanging around in this hotel room! What's up? Nothing! I'm reading! - Aren?t you talking to me anymore? - I'm tired and want to go home! Come on, let's go to the airport! Dude, we still have tons of time! And? I don't feel like hanging around here anymore! There is a free seat over there! Berl?n - Sch?nefeld Airport There's the bus! I'm taking the X 7. - Why that one? - I'll give you a call! Calling to Enis - Hi. - Hi. Can you tell me the last time my buddy was here? The blonde pretty boy? Yeah, yeah. The blonde pretty boy. - I see that he cancelled. - He cancelled his membership? Yeah. OK. Thanks! Just call him! Hi. What are you doing here? I was waiting for you! OK. You're not coming to the gym anymore?! I have too much to do at school! I just don't have enough time to go to the gym. And to see me, you don't have enough time for that either? Not right now, no. What happened with your supplements store? Well, I couldn't find anyone to handle the sales. Well, I've got to go now! - Go where? - To the university! Delete Photo Your mobile is ringing! Never mind! Aren't I allowed to know who it is? Do you have a new lover? I'm afraid I'll have to disappoint you. Hey, that's Philipp! I'll call back later! You can talk to him now! Not now! Why not? Just because! Why didn't you invite Philipp to the party? Why should I? I thought you were friends? - He wouldn't have fit in. - Oh, come on! He would have fit right in. My gay friends would have found him sweet. Of course that is a reason. You know, I would find it sweet, if you had a thing with Philipp. Yeah, I know. But I'm not doing you that favor. I would enjoy watching you two fooling around. I'm sure he's a good kisser. Stop now! Why are you so serious? I'm just kidding around! I'm tired and want to go home! Incoming call from Phil What's up? Come to the park for a minute! Oh man, right now is a bad time... I have so much to do for school... I need to go to the copy shop... Please! OK. But just for a minute! - Hi. - Hi. What's up? I wanted to say goodbye to you. What? I'm leaving Berlin. Well... Where are you going? To Greece. I'm starting work in a hotel. For how long? I don't know how long it will last... Until I've forgotten you! - Come on, you're just kidding! - No. Here. My flight is leaving soon! Ticket! You're not serious, are you? Yes! And I'm sorry. You don't have to be sorry. And you're going to drop everything? I'm not sure myself. And what about your studies? Taking a break... I'll think about that later. Life is full of bad jokes, Enis. Ever notice that? Nope. Where is Philipp? He's probably waiting for you somewhere. OK. Kristina? I would like to say goodbye to you! English Subtitle Translation: Seth Goldberg
