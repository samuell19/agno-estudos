See this? It's workin'. Told you, didn't I. Get us some light. Who's this? What's this? Just, don't touch anything, okay? You think these lights will still work? Yep. How old is this place? - It's pretty old. I doubt this place has been used since the '80s. What did they use it for? - All kinds of tests. This airbase has probably tested missile strikes, radar tracking, thermonuclear weapons tests. This bunker's a shelter from when they used to do these explosive tests back there, up on the range. Are you sure they're not gonna know we're down here? This place hasn't been used in decades. What's that? - Nothing. - Nothing! You've got a fuckin' gun in there! What are you doing with a gun? Where did you even get a gun? Listen, I want to know what's going on or me and Laura are out of here. - You wasn't supposed to see that. - Oh, really? What else was I not supposed to see? Or know for that matter? No, Sinead, level with me. - This is my business. - What business? Okay, your business? Well, you can take your business elsewhere. Me and Laura are out of here. - No, Mary, wait, I. I'm being followed. You're what? - Someone's following me. Ever since my father disappeared, I think that some organization or agency's been after me too. I've had cars are following me, people in the street for months. - You're paranoid. - No, I'm not. I swear. Someone is following me. - How do you know they're definitely following you? - It's guys in suits. - And you're carrying a gun? - They may have got to my father but they're not gonna get to me. - Sinead, your father committed suicide, on a bridge. - He was set up! They got to him! They put out that story! How come they never found a body but they knew what happened. He left a note in his own handwriting. - They forced him to do it. My dad was not suicidal. - Now you think they're on to you. I was followed here tonight. - Are you sure? - A man, in a car, followed me practically from my house in London all the way here. A man in a suit. - It's not-- - Don't worry, I lost him. - How? - I lost him, okay? Are you sure? - I've been followed quite a bit, Marty. I know when I've lost them. - So what we gonna do about tonight, then? Nothing. - Nothing? - That's right, nothing. We're gonna carry on as planned. Do you really think that's the best thing to do, considering this? - Look, if we get a hot lead that something's being tested, we have to jump on it, right? It might be six months before we get another one. - Yeah, we still have to make sure we're safe though. - I've made sure. It's all okay. - If your lead is wrong and that plane doesn't arrive tonight, the deadline for this article is in two days. - Well, you just be set up with your cameras at 3:30 tomorrow morning on the north runway and we'll worry about it then. Now don't worry about tonight, we're all clear. So do we have a job to do? Okay, let's get things sorted. We should get back to the tents. - No, you go ahead. I'm gonna wait here for a bit. Are you sure? You're not instilling much confidence in me right now. - Don't worry, just want to be on my own for a while. I'm near the south runway anyway. I might go take a look in a bit. Okay, for your sake, the radio signal's down there. - That should do. These tunnels are made of metal. They're designed to conduct signals all the way to the surface. Okay, I'm gonna go back to Laura. Jesus! Marty, what the fuck you doing? What? - All this creeping around? What you doin' out there? Thought I saw someone outside. Saw someone, army? - I thought it was, but no. - You sure? - Yes. Listen to me, I'm starting to sound just like Sinead. - How do you mean? Where is Sinead? - She stayed in the bunker. She says she's better there. Easier for her to get to the south runway. - How do you mean that you're starting to sound like her. - She thinks she's being followed. - What, here, tonight? - No, just in general. Says her car's being followed. - Right, do you think someone's onto us? - Don't worry about it. Sinead's just paranoid. Ever since her dad, she thinks the government got to him. Now she thinks they're after her. - Well, her dad's death was suspicious, I mean-- - Come on! You're sounding just like her. Nobody that jumps off of that bridge is ever found in that river. It's not a conspiracy. She's taking this all too seriously. - Well, I feel uneasy about being here tonight. What if we do get caught We won't! - What if someone has been tracking us? We've been a little bit high profile in the past with this magazine. What if the government are takin' a serious interest in us? - If you want we can leave now. - No, I didn't say that! I just think we should be extra careful from now on. We can leave right now! - I don't want to leave. - Good, maybe we can get some pictures of these test finds or maybe even a story. Then we can get ourselves out of the jam that you've got us into. Laura-- - Fuck you! - Red Light, is there any other personnel out tonight? Anyone I don't know of? That's a negative, Black Star. - Received. Red Light, is there any classified personnel out tonight? Sorry, Black Star, I don't have that information. Is there any problem? - No problem, Red Light. I have Sigma and Lunar reporting possible movement on the mountainside earlier tonight. Have you seen anything? - Negative, Red Light. I was just wondering if there's any classified personnel out tonight. Black Star, they won't tell me if they were out. - Yeah, I thought that. Red Light, moving on. There's no way it was suicide. Sinead, can you hear me? Laura, is Marty with you? - He went out to look at the north runway. Told him not too, as he doesn't have a radio. He left it in the car. - Shit, so you've only got one radio between you both? Yes. - So he's out. - He wanted to check on the runway. Are you coming back? - No, not yet. - Marty said that you thought you'd been followed. Do you think someone's here or after you? I don't know. - Is that why you're hiding down there? Look, we can just call it off you know. Go home and get out of this trespassing and stuff. - No, not tonight. - I don't care about the money. I'm worried that we'll get caught. We'll go to prison if they catch you and I just don't like it up here. This place isn't like all the other places we've been too. There's something wrong with this place. I'm worried. Don't you want to leave? - This is my last job here, Laura. - How do you mean? - I'm gonna take tonight's money and leave the country. They know where to find me. - Are you sure we're gonna see something here tonight? They won't cover our expenses for our last three trips if we don't come up with something. I know. - Well, Marty and I need the money too. Our situation has changed. Hey Sinead, do you know what? I've been thinking. - What? - Well, be surprised what you think of when you're in a tent alone, way up in the middle of nowhere. I would. - Do you know what the meaning of life it? I've no idea. - The meaning of life is making the best out of what you've got. - Is this what you figured out? - I don't just mean the little things like this. I mean everything in life. Got the idea as Marty and I were driving here tonight. I was feeling miserable about my life and what I had. More importantly, what I didn't have. And then I saw a blind man at the side of the road, walking with a guide dog. Really hit home for me. Here I am, miserable, sad about stuff, and there was some poor bastard who had it much, much worse than me. What the hell am I moanin' about? That person has to make the best out of what they've got. And I have to do the same. We all have to do the same because it's all you can do. - Sinead. Sinead. Marty, where the fuck are you? Sinead. Sinead! Laura? - Something's fucking happening. What's happening, what is it? - Something's screaming outside. Sinead, Sinead! There's two dead sheep out here. Sinead? Laura, what's happening up there? - I don't know. Marty is missing and someone's killed two sheep. I'm getting a bit fucking scared here, you know. - Laura, look, look outside and tell me what's going on. Laura? Laura? Laura? Laura, come in! Laura, can you hear me? Laura. Black Star, this is Red Light. We have a code red in gray zone. Please proceed there immediately to help with the perimeter. - Roger, Red Light. - Sinead. - Marty, what's happening, where's Laura? - I don't know. - What's happened, what's happened? Marty, Marty? - There's blood. I heard her scream. - What, where? - God, I couldn't tell you because we needed the money. - Marty, what's happened? - Laura's been pulling up clothes and stuff on credit like mad. Laura, she. She's pregnant. - Marty. - Now she's gone. - Marty! Shit! - Laura! - Marty, are you there? Oh my god. Be very still. Don't make a sound. What's going on. - Just keep real still, don't make any sound. Now just slowly, but very quietly move away. If we make a sound, we're dead, okay. Who are you? - Don't make a sound. Do as I do and follow me. Remember, no sudden movements and no sound. - What the fuck is out there. - Believe me, you don't want to know. Do as I say, move. - Okay. Come on, let's get inside. - Can we talk now? Quietly. - You come back here for that? Yeah, and this. And what's that? Evidence. - Evidence of what? Evidence of what I think we just saw back there. - What was that? - The first civilian sighting of a silverhide. - A silver what? - It's a top secret animal which the government and the military have had in their possession since one was discovered back in the '20s. Now it has silver fur which is rumored to become invisible under moonlight. - What's it doing here? - The state, they kept it in that live fenced off paddock. But there was a power cut or something, which knocked out the electric fence and it got out. - You said it's top secret. - Above top secret. - It's that lot, they're lookin' for it. - How the hell can this thing become invisible? - It has something to do with its fur and what happens when moonlight hits it. Nobody really knows. - Well, how do you know so much about it? A friend of mine spent most of his life trying to find it. He was the one that found out it might be kept up here. So he sort of visited me and was trying photograph it, and prove that it actually exists. - I think I read something about him. His name was Steve, he disappeared up here, didn't he? So it's true, you found it. - He spent the last few years of his life, before he disappeared, trying to prove that silverhide was real. He never found it. Never got a photograph. It's what he wanted the most, get his name in print saying that he found it. Which is what I have here. I've got films of it earlier tonight. The split second out of the moonlight, just long enough to press a shutter. Steve always said he was right but I never believed him. With some cloud cover over the moon, give us a chance to get over the hill. Depending on how close it is. We have to get away from here. It's best not to stay in one place too long. This thing moves fast and is lethal on the ground. - So I still have a friend here, she might be alive. Yeah, okay, let's go. - Just move very slowly and very quietly. Our only chance is if we can hear this thing and avoid it. Sh. - What is it? - Got something. - Where? - It's over that way. Maybe it's. This thing always strikes from behind when it's ready to. I think he's trying to get behind us. - There! - Sh! He's not seen us. If this is the silverhide, he would have spotted us a long time ago and he's stalking us. - What do you mean, if? - We can't be sure if you can't see. - What the fuck do we do? - Whatever we do we can't let it get behind us. It's where we'll pass? - Oh, fuck! - Most small animals are afraid to come, that's how I shot my photograph. I knew exactly where it was. We should walk towards it. - Walk towards it? Where is it? - I don't know. I see something. Keep very still and remain silent. - The moon's covered. - Right, we should be able to see it. - I don't see it. - No, I don't. - I thought you said it was here. Something was here. - Well, then we should be able to see it, right? Clear as day. - It's a fucking sheep! - We may have played them. Don't move! - Go! No! This way. Blackstar, this is Snow Bird. Come in, Blackstar one. No sign of specimen or classified yet. - Something's going on. What else are they testing here tonight? There's been a lot of activity in those hangers this week. A lot of black suits, black helicopters. There could be something there. - Yeah, that's what worries me. Blackstar, got reports of civilians on the mountain. Repeat, civilians on the mountian. We need move fast ahead, ASAP. - Oh shit. They were sighted in Black Valley. Snow Bird you getting this? Roger Red Light. - Red Light, I'm on it. Geez. - Fuck. Keep pressure here. Hello, hello, mayday, mayday. What are you doing? - Calling the emergency services, you have to get to a hospital. They're gonna catch us. - Look, you're hurt bad, you're hurt really bad. What about the Army? - You aren't gonna make it if we don't. The National Port Authority has helicopters and ambulances. Maybe we can avoid the Army. Thank you, love, I'm sorry. - Please don't be. Anybody else would do the same thing. Calling the National Port Authority this is an emergency call from the Black Mountains, can anybody hear me? Have a wounded man in need of urgent medical assistance. Can you read me? Can't believe they shot at us. This place has a lot of secrets to protect. It didn't surprise me one bit. - But shooting an unarmed civilian. As far as they could tell, we could be terrorists. They'd shoot first and ask questions later. - We've been photographing air bases for years doing stories. It never got dangerous before. Yeah, that wasn't here. - Hello, mayday, can anybody hear me? This is an emergency call. Port Authority, read you loud and clear. Please tell us, what is your emergency? - I've got a wounded man, it's a firearms wound to the abdomen. And we're trapped. A firearms wound? Can you confirm? - Yes, that's correct, he's lost a lot of blood. Can you give me your location and how many of you there, please? - With, we're, near the south runway. There's two of us. South runway, as in on the base? - Yeah. That's on government ground, can you be more specific, please? - We're in a bunker, tunnel one I think, near the south runway. Tunnel one? - Yes, it's a disused shelter, we're stuck here. And there are two of you, one with a gunshot wound? - Yes, there were four originally. Four? Where are the other two? - I believe they're both missing. Are they still on the mountain? What happened? - There's something dangerous on this mountain, some animal. An animal? - Yes. And did you see this animal? - Not exactly. Well, can you please tell me precisely what you saw? - Why's he asking that? - I don't know what it was. Look, are you sending ambulance come and pick us up or what? We're arranging something for you now. Can you please be more specific about the animal that you saw, please? - I told you, I don't know what it was, but it attacked some people. But you saw it, correct? - It's the base, don't answer. - Are you sure? They only want to know if you saw the silverhide. - Oh shit! What can we do? - What time til they find us? You realize that this is classified information which we are discussing. Compartmentalized information classified above top secret. Whoever you are, you have trespassed onto government property. That means that what you have seen here doesn't belong to you. You do not have access, do you understand? You have to be debriefed immediately as this is a serious breach of national security. And any disclosure of this information is strictly forbidden. We are sending an extraction team. For your own safety, do not attempt to leave the shelter or the base perimeter. This specimen is extremely hazardous. We cannot warn you enough about this. Please await further instructions. - Are you sending medical assistance? How long are you gonna be? Hello? Can you hear me? Fuck it! Are you okay? - The Army doesn't want anyone to know about this and they're probably already working on a coverup. What are they gonna do with us? - I'm sure they'll do everything in their power to stop us ever talking about this. We'll probably be taken into custody, interrogated. Maybe even force us under gagging order. They'll press charges but trespassing, you know. The silverhide and the military possibilities as is, is too big a secret for the government to ever let out, no matter what. They can use this technology and then make billions of pounds and they will coverup any leak of any kind. - I think they were onto me before I even got here tonight. As I got into my car, I noticed a man watching me from down the street. A man in a dark suit. And when I drove here, he followed me for miles before I finally lost him. I saw him watching me again tonight when I was in the tent earlier. And when that soldier shot at us, I saw him again. I think they've been following me for weeks. I shouldn't have come here tonight. They knew somehow that I was coming here. Maybe the monitored my emails, or my text messages, I don't know. But they found me. Now they're gonna get me. Just like they got my dad. So how long have we got? - A couple or few minutes, I'd say, they're quick. Look, you can still get out of here. You don't need to stay. Get out of here. - You, you're wounded, I can't-- - Come on, believe me, I've seen them move. They get here quick. Get away. - You never did find out what happened to your friend, did you? Yeah, I did. Swallowed up in a coverup, all in the name of national security. Just like your friends will be too, come tomorrow morning. Look, there's no point in us both getting caught. - Yeah. Just got to make the best out of what we've got. 'Cause that's all you can do. I'm sorry. These aren't the same lights that were on a minute ago. Maybe backup here, due to the storm? - The storm was a while ago. Why would they come on now? I noticed earlier that the storm knocked out some of the power to the airbase. A lot of buildings went out like this. - It's getting cold in here. Is it? - There's cold air coming from the tunnel. - I thought of something. - What? - I thought of something, over here! These ultraviolet lights, over here. Batches of them. - What are you saying? - I've seen these kind of lights before, down on the paddock by the runway. They turn them on whenever the moon is covered by thick cloud cover. It has the same effect on the silverhide as moonlight. It renders it-- Invisible. Sneaky bastards! - We won't be able to see it. Why do that? I don't know, maybe it was it's automated, but it was there. - Oh, shit! - Don't move, this thing's attracted to noise, movement, motion. - There's no fucking way out of here! Blackstar, where's your present location. - We're currently completing the sweep on the north face, Lead Zone. We've been advised to inform to hold your position, soldier. You are not to proceed any further. - Sorry, repeat, Red Light? Hold to where you are Blackstar. We have been told the others will handle the situation. Our services are no longer required, confirm. - We can have the sweep done in 20 minutes, we're here. This is a direct order, Blackstar. Stand down and hold position. Do you copy? - Roger, Red Light. Everybody heads up. We're staying on course, okay? - How'd it even know to come down here? Can it even fit down that fucking tunnel? - I don't know. It can stretch out pretty low, I think. Like cats creep through small holes. Who the fuck knows, it knows we're here though. - That thing's gonna rip us apart. - I know. - We won't even see it coming. - I know! Specimen is in tunnel. Near the target. It's just a matter of seconds, sir. We'll have this thing all cleared up. It's gonna be bloody. There will be four witnesses terminated. Security breach controlled. - It's here. Just watch the signals, it's staying in the tunnel. - No, it's here, I know it. Hello, can you hear me? - Hello? Hello? Hello, are you in the tunnel? - This thing's in it. You've got to help us, it's in the tunnel. Can you hear me? I'm at the entrance. - Yeah, I can hear you. I think it's heard you. Is it coming back up? - I don't know. Is it coming out? I don't know. It's gone all quiet. It's not moving. - He what? It's still in there. - Well, where do you think it is? It's right behind that hatch. Don't move! Don't look around. Slowly put the gun on the floor. - There's people trapped down there. Lower the gun, slowly, we'll talk. - They haven't got much time. There's something down there with them. - Okay, just lower the gun on the floor, we'll talk, easy. - Look, we haven't got time for this! The banging's stopped, are you still there? - Attack! - Can you hear me? - Everybody hold fast! - Someone's coming. - Target is cloaked. - Dad? - Sinead. - Oh my god, Dad! Let me help you. I know you're alive. Oh, oh my god. Sit down, let me see. One, it's on your right, it's moving fast. - Everyone hold still. This is really bad. - We're going to use audio silence for the target. This thing strikes from behind, so watch your backs. It was you. You were the one following me all these weeks. - I wanted to see you. I wanted to explain things. Where I was. But the government was always too close behind me. - Lunar, Sigma what do you have? - That was you following me all this time and from London, tonight. - I saw you leaving with packed bags and I knew you were going away for good. So I followed you. Then when I saw you were coming here, I had to try and stop you. - What have you got Snow Bird? Have you got audio? How did you do it? Why the fake suicide? Why didn't you tell me? - I couldn't. I knew too much. I had to try and fool everyone. Get him out, he's down! - I was involved in a lot stuff I couldn't tell you about. After I left the RAF-- - Anyone there? - Secrets upon secrets upon secrets. One huge lie after another. It was never ending. I breached security and I just wanted out. - Sigma, where is he! Redstar, repeat! Lunar, Sigma! - Look, you've lost a lot of blood. - Sinead, I've come here to warn you. This place isn't what you think. I've found out a lot about this place. It's very dangerous for you to be here. That's why I broke cover tonight. - Sigma, do you hear me? - There's a faceless side to this base. A breakaway army. This top secret government agency is secretly running this base. And they have technology here of which this creature is just the butt of. - Redstar, what are you saying? On the ground. - These tunnels that are here. They weren't abandoned in the '70s and '80s like everyone thinks. They were converted to test the silverhide. To try and train it. They installed ultraviolet lights up there as a signal beacon. - A what? - Like a dog whistle, to attract the creature. But as you've already seen, this thing cannot be controlled. - Sigma, Sigma! - They gave up trying to control it and they concentrate on trying to figure out what makes it invisible. - Fuck this! Don't worry about me. - Don't worry about me! There's not much that can be done. But you must get out now. When that creature is finished up there the beacon will attract it back down here again. Can you hear this, sir, confirm. We see them shadowing the west bound side. - Hold fast everyone, hold fast. Everyone stay put, we can't see it. - You must escape, Sinead. - I can't leave without you. - I've seen you now. I've told you what you needed to know. I've done what I planned. I can't go on outrunning them any longer, I just can't. - If you hear something, tell me the location. - Look, look. - I'm trying. - Tell the people, warn them, that they have sinister technology here and they mean to use it badly. They will control the world with this technology. - Sigma, what's happening! Sigma! What technology, what do you want me to do? - Just get the story out. - Snow Bird! And then disappear. Then our job will be down. Come on! - Who's firing? - But you must hide yourself well. 'Cause they will never give up looking for you. - What's happening, can anyone confirm? Dad, please. - Look, I'm so sorry it all went this way. I never got to say goodby last time. - Right, we're pulling out. Abort, abort! It's time. Is anyone down there? Can you hear me? It's coming down. - Please, help us. Can you hear me? On the wall there's a panic button. Hit it once and it will turn off the UV lights. Push it twice and it will gas the thing. You need a gas mask. Do you copy? It's coming down! Do you copy? Hit the panic button. You have 10 seconds before the gas fills the room. - Take this. Say that my friend, Steve, took the photos. Give him the credit. Come on, take it! I'll distract this thing, you get the gas mask and get out of here. Go, go! - No. - Get out of here!
