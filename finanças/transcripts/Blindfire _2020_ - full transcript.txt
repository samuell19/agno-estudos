9-1-1. What's your emergency? Shit. Shit. Sir, could you try to remain calm? What is your emergency? I- Let's start by giving me your name - and your address. - Don't tell me what to do. Don't you ever tell me what do, do you understand? I do understand. How can I help you? I won't let her take my kids. She can't take them. She can't. They're mine. Sir, I need to know where you are so that I can send help. I'll fucking shoot her if she leaves. You have to stop her. If she tries to take my kids, I'll fucking kill her. So what? It's chicken. Don't fucking judge me. It's not me. Adam asks his guests all the time. Okay, what do you have against chicken? Nothing. Nothing. Bake it, fry it, barbecue it. Just don't put it in a taco. You're crazy, it's delicious. Oh, my god, whatever. You know what? You get a pass. You get a pass 'cause you grew up around mostly white people. Oh, well, I'm sorry I didn't grow up eating lengua or barbacoa. Besides, look at you. You're eating rabbit food in a wrap. Eh! I love meat. I love meat. It's just Maria wanted us to try this vegan shit, so what am I supposed to do? I don't see Maria here. Yeah, but I'm gonna go home and she's gonna ask me what I had for lunch, so what am I supposed to do, lie to her every day? You tell Maria what you had for lunch every day? Available units, we have a domestic dispute in progress at 14 Independence Square. Repeat, domestic in progress. 14 Independence Square. Shit, that's close. Unit 451 responding. We're two minutes out. Suspect is armed and hostile. Turn right. Suspect believed to be holding family hostage. All right, go over here. Yeah. Number of hostages, unknown. Left on Path. Okay, kill the lights. Right here, right here, right here, right here. Unit 451. We're on location. Unit 451, set up a perimeter and standby for SWAT. No. No, no! Come on! Came from around back. This is Unit 451. We got a hostile situation. What's your ETA on SWAT? SWAT is five minutes out. Shit. Bishop. Get your ass up, now! Somebody's gonna get killed! Police! Get on the fucking ground! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Fuck! This is Unit 451. Shots fired. Shots fired. Copy. Bishop! Bishop. Shit, shit, shit. Bishop. Don't you fucking move! Let me see your hands! Keep your hands where I can see 'em! Are you hit? He's bleeding out. Call it in. Are you hit?! I'm fine! Call it in! This is Unit 451. Shots fired. - Suspect down. - Stop resisting! We need an ambulance. - Repeat, shots fired. - Give me your hand. - Turn around. - Suspect down. Request for an ambulance immediately. Swat: All right, let's go! - Let's go, in every closet! - Check upstairs. Suspect down. - Get her outta there! - Get the girl. You did good. I'm glad you and Wilkins made it outta there safe. You may have saved that girl's life tonight. Dispatch said the guy talked about burning the house down. Are you all right? I know this was the first time you've had to... I'm fine, Sergeant. It's okay. It's not supposed to be easy. Most officers are lucky, they go their whole careers without firing a weapon. It's a difficult thing to prepare for. It's part of the job. I'm here if you need me. Don't have to talk to some stranger about it if you don't want to. Get some rest. Someone from HR will call tomorrow and walk you through everything. - Are you okay? - Yes, I'm fine. Okay. Why didn't you call me? Had to hear it from Wilkins? Had to give my statement to the FID, and then Sergeant wanted to talk to me. I wasn't thinking. I got really scared thinking about losing you. Can we, um Can you just come home? Can you come home? I can't. Wilkins and I, we have some paperwork to finish, so... That's fine. I mean, come back home. Jan. I'll call you tonight. Okay. Really glad you're all right. I did not see this one coming. Yeah, I should've been there with you. You should've waited. Wasn't going in, I was just trying to hear what he was saying through the window. Then he kicked the door open, almost took my fucking face off- - You got lucky. You're gonna get yourself killed pulling the hero shit. Fuck. Fucking wired. What makes a guy do that to his own family? Gonna get another drink. I'm good. Yeah? Hey, hero. Celebrating your big day, huh? All right. What? Andre was my guy. Yeah. We played ball at Central together. Good man. - Good family. - Okay, it wasn't like that. It was self-defense. You even got the black chick vouching for you. - That's cute. - Okay, who the fuck are you? Hey, tell me something, do you get like a prize for every brother you kill or something, or like a cake, or like stickers. How many niggas do you have to kill- - You motherfucker! - Get the fuck off me! Fuck you, man! - What? - Fuck you! What? Hey, what's wrong? - What's wrong? - You weren't there! - What's wrong with you? - Fuck you, motherfucker! - We all on the same team. - Hey, hey! He's an asshole, all right? He wasn't there. He wasn't. He doesn't know what happened. Fuck you! You weren't there! - You weren't there! - Hey, he wasn't, all right? Let it go. Come on. - Listen to your girl, huh? - Chill the fuck out! Come on. Chill the fuck out. Bishop! Bye, hero. What a day. You've been here a week, and you didn't tell me? Nice place, right? You can't keep pulling this shit, man. Fuck it, give me one of those. Just... Gonna be good. What was it this time? It's always the same. You know, Jan doesn't get it. Get what? Us. Our job. The law, what we do. She just wants to find the good in everyone. She wants to fix everyone. Well, you married a social worker. What do you expect? Don't opposites attract? You're asking a lesbian if opposites attract? - Yeah. - Look, all I know is you gotta stop. You can't keep pulling this shit. I mean, one of these days, she's gonna smarten up and she's gonna leave your ass. Then what? Yeah, I know. You know? Then what the fuck are you doing? I mean, you gotta fix it, make it right. Hey! Knock it off before we call the police! I am the fucking police! I'm sorry. Fuck. Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Bishop. What are you doing here? I just wanted to talk to Sergeant Ward. That's not a good idea, all right? He's busy right now. Fine. I just wanna look at my report again. You're fucking wasted. Go home. Okay? Please. Why? Excuse me for just a moment. Take them to my office. What's going on? What are you doing here, Bishop? I thought I was clear yesterday. You need to take some time. Lucy. Lucy. Lucy, is that him? Is that him? Is that the man that killed my husband? - Mrs. Hughes, listen to me. - No, no. Is that him? - I wanna talk to him! - Okay. - I wanna talk to you. - No, no, no. - Go, you should go. - Okay, listen- - You killed Andre! - I know. - You killed my husband! - Be careful, wait, wait. He's the one who killed Andre! I know, I know, I know. I wanna talk to him! Why did you do it?! I wanna know! Why did you come in my house and kill my husband?! I wanna know! I wanna know! - Let's go in- - ROSIE: I wanna know. Wait, come on now. Come on, let's go in. Now, listen, I've got a family in mourning over there. I can't have you here right, you understand? I've got to get back and sort this all out. You go home and get some rest. - Are you defending him? - No, ma'am. No. That man murdered my husband. Ma'am, ma'am, please. Don't touch me. If you would just take your seat. Just take your seat, we'll talk, we'll talk. Officer Wilkins, - you can step out. - Hey, what do you know? Rosie, wait. Wait, Rosie. Sis, what do you know? You have to tell me what you know. Look, can you tell me what you know? - Please? - Let her go, come on now. Come on. Sit down. Sit down. Sit down, now. All right. All right. I'm terribly sorry for your loss. We want to be completely - transparent. - You don't get to be sorry. Tell me why your officers were at my house. They were responding to a hostage call from your residence. Now, the footage from my officer's body camera showed your husband with a broken bottle exiting the backdoor where the altercation took place. Altercation? Altercation? You mean the one where my husband was killed? I wanna hear it. I wanna hear that tape! That was not Andre! That's not what happened! You can ask my... You can ask my daughter. She was there the whole... She was there the whole time. This is what we talked about. Okay? No. No, no! Come on! Get up, get up, get up. Come on. You got it, you got it. No. Fire this guy. Come on. Yeah, that's it. Come on, let's get it. Let's get it, let's get it. Ah, shit. Come on. Language, Daddy. I'm sorry, baby. Hey, it's 8:30. Gonna get your schoolwork done? It's all done. Okay, well, go on up and get it out so your mom can check it in the morning, okay? And brush your teeth. It's almost time for bed. Hey. Don't play me now. Come on. Hustle. And he will be the lead blocker for Hughes. He's got breakaway speed! Bye-bye. No, it's okay, baby. Daddy just got excited. I'll be up after I throw this mess outside. Over eight points defensively here in the four games that have led to this six-eight championship. Oh, come on. Somebody's gonna get killed! This playbook is trash! What are you doing?! Get your ass up, now! Police, get on the fucking- Dad? Dad? Dad? - Dad. - Shots fired. Let me see your fucking hands. Repeat, shots fired. Suspect down. Request for an ambulance immediately. Give me your other fucking hand, now! Give it to me! Turn around. Give me your other hand! - Let's go, in every closet! - Check upstairs. - Suspect down. - Get her outta there! Get the girl. Hey. How's it going? Fucking great. Right. Sorry. What's up? They brought in the girl to give an official statement. They wanna open up an investigation. Investigation? Into what? The wife says it doesn't make sense. There were no hostages. She says she was at the hospital visiting a friend. He was the perfect husband. What did the girl say? She said she was upstairs. You heard her scream, though, right? Yeah. Yeah, I heard her. Okay, so why was he on the porch with a bottle? I mean, can they explain that? He broke the bottle watching the game. Look, I got one of the guys to send over a copy of the Hughes call, but you gotta delete it after you listen to it. I don't think the family's heard it yet. Did you listen to it? Yeah. It's messed up. So you just gotta be careful 'cause it can't leak out. Of course. I just wanna know what happened. Okay. I'm sending it now. Thanks for this, all right? 9-1-1. What's your emergency? Shit. Shit. Just try to remain calm, sir. What is your emergency? I... Start by giving me your name and your address. Don't tell me what to do. Don't you ever tell me what do, you understand? Sir, yes, I understand. But how can I help you? I won't let her take my kids. She can't take them. They're mine. Sir, I need to know where you are so that I can send help. I'll shoot her if she leaves. You have to stop her. If she tries to take my kids, I'll fucking kill her. Where are you now? In the kitchen. Okay. And where is she? In the closet. Are you sending someone? Yes, officers have been dispatched. Now, I'm gonna- Police are expected to make a statement tomorrow on the incident that took the life of local football coach Andre Hughes. Police received a distressed call that brought them to the Hughes residence just after 9:00 p.m., when an altercation began, resulting in the death of the well-respected football coach. He is survived by his wife Rosie Hughes and their daughter Lucy, as well as his parents Gayle and Albert Hughes. When we return, we'll go to Alison Wade who was with the Hughes family earlier today. I've covered a lot of stories on the school and... Andre over the years. He was such a kind man. So sorry for your loss. Okay. Ready? Yeah. Whenever you're ready. Andre Hughes was a loving husband and father. He was the light of our family and he was a part of this community his entire life. I want answers. We all lost a great man last night, and I wanna know why. Andre loved everyone, and everyone loved him. Why was my husband murdered by the police in his own home? Is that him? Lucy, is that him? Is that the man that killed my husband? - Mrs. Hughes, listen to me. - No, no. Is that him? Hey, it's Wilkins. You gotta come in. Sergeant Ward needs to talk to you. It's urgent. We want justice! We want justice! We want justice! We want justice! We want justice! We want justice! We want justice! We want justice! Did you see everyone outside? Yeah, there have been suits here all day. Fuck. Look, I know Sergeant Ward wants to talk to you, but they're not telling me what's going on. They think I shot him because he was black. I shot him because I felt threatened, because I was doing my fucking job. Yeah, I know. But listen, man, they're tired of being seen as a threat. I mean, they wanna know were you threatened by him or what he looks like. You get that, right? Are you saying I'm a racist? Did I say that? - Did I say that? - No, what the fuck are you saying, then, Wilkins- Good morning. - Morning, sir. - Hey, Sarge. Officer Wilkins, could we speak with Bishop alone, please? Yes, sir. This is Mr. Smith. He's the department lawyer. - Morning. - Will. Morning. Okay. Please. Bishop, are you all right? I didn't expect any of this. You responded to a distress call about a violent situation and you acted with bravery. Not many people realize the burdens we volunteer for when we take on this job every day. It's a heroic responsibility just to put on a badge. Now, we received some disturbing information this morning and we're still investigating its legitimacy. But I wanted to sit down with you, give you the news first, so that I can answer any questions you may have. An email came in. It contained a recording of some people playing video games the night of the Hughes call. Went on for hours. There are pages and pages of arguments in the transcriptions here. At first, it made no sense, but then one of the players threatened to send a SWAT team to someone's house. That address was 14 Independence Square. I just don't understand - how assholes these days- - You know, I know this is a lot to take in, but what's important to remember are the facts of the situation. Take a look at that. Now, from the footage, from your body cam, Andre Hughes was angry that night when he came through the door at you. You and Officer Wilkins both reported hearing the shattering of glass inside the house and a girl's scream. As you secured a perimeter, you encountered the suspect at the door holding a broken bottle in his hand. You announced yourself as a police officer and instructed him to get on the ground, correct? Mr. Bishop? Yes. He disobeyed those orders and threw the bottle at you, causing you to fire at the suspect. Is that correct? Officer Bishop? Officer Bishop, these are the facts that we must be very clear about before your hearing, do you understand? Jesus Christ. I'm sorry, Sergeant. - It's okay. - I'm sorry. It's okay. It's okay. Let me go get something to clean this up. It's all right. It's all right. I'll be right back. Oh. Excuse me, Sergeant, sir. Can you tell me what's going on? Like, what's the suit doing here? We got an email. The call was faked. Some assholes online. Jesus Christ. We got swatted? What did Bishop say? Nothing yet. He got sick. Oh, my god, how is this even possible? How does this happen? I don't know. People are fucked. Shit! I'll go check the parking lot. God dammit, Bishop. This is a big liability for the department, Sergeant. Those news stations are growing out there too. This guy was a local legend. You need to make Bishop understand he acted in self-defense. Get him in line. This can't look like blindfire. If not for him, for the rest of the department. He needs to be at that hearing next week and he needs to have it together. He's gone, sir. They said he grabbed a few things from his desk and took off. Did he talk to anyone? No, sir. Oh, God dammit, Bishop. If he's AWOL, I can't do anything to help him. Well, I'll go find him. No, no, no, no, no, no. Stay here. We need you here. Have you seen that crowd outside? It's getting bigger. I understand. Dammit. Come on, Bishop. Hi, you've reached - Will Bishop. - Shit. Hi, you've reached Will Bishop. Son of a bitch. I can't get to the phone, so leave a message and I'll get back to you. Thanks. Bishop, it's me. Come on, man, you gotta talk to me. You gotta talk to me, okay? I know what kinda cop you are. I know you. We can work this out together, but you gotta call me. - Hi. - Hey, it's Wilkins. What's going on? I need your help. Yeah, there's people gathering outside of our house with signs. They have been for the last hour. I've called Will, he's not answering. What's going on? I can't get ahold of Will. He just left the station and- - We want justice! - Jan? - We want justice! - Jan? ChayMoney. As tensions rise in the community, we go live to Alison Wade who is at the police precinct. - Alison? - Want justice! We want justice! We want justice! - We want justice! - The protest remains peaceful as the numbers continue to grow outside the police station. Students have been arriving wearing football jerseys and the schools colors in support of the coach. Yo, flank left. I don't know if I have it. They're right there. They're right there. Yo, I'm coming. I'm coming. You get the drop. Where's the other team? Look at tunnels. Take the stairs, take the stairs. What are you doing? Come on. Ah, shit. God dammit. Yo, this guy sucks. Hello? Hello? Hello. Can you hear me? - Hello? - Yo, who is this guy? I'm looking for ChayMoney. You know him? Piss off. I'm looking for ChayMoney or the Grinch. You know where they are? Yo, quit the game, you fucking noob. Hey, can you just tell me where they are? Are you joking? This is the internet, you pleb. Hey, man, I'm in the middle of a game with them, so can you just tell me where to find them? Oh, my god, this guy sucks. Hey, grandpa, go back to the main menu and add them to your friends list. Thanks. Thanks, man. Fuck. Wolverine Nation! I wanna thank everyone for your support this season. Coaching football has always been a dream of mine and that's a dream that comes with both the wins and the losses. Now, we may have come up short today, but I want you to know this is a season I will never forget, okay? I can only hope that when the pain of tonight's game wears off, that each and every one of you has as many fond memories as I do. I want every one of these young men to understand the impact they've had on me, on their teammates, the impact on the other students and the whole community around them, and on the memories that you created that we will cherish for a lifetime. Hey, cupcake. Come here. You wanna say something? - Go Wolverines! - Go Wolverines! Hey, it's me. Wilkins told me where to find you. Come on. Let me in. Your car's in the parking lot and I can smell the cigarettes from here. I'll stay out here all night if I have to. What are you doing here? I love you and I wanna help. You can't fix this one, Jan. Please let me in. I can't. Okay. Okay, then we can talk like this. Do you remember when we first started dating, and we'd just would, like, drive circles around the city with nowhere to be? You know, those were some of my favorite nights. Yeah, you know, stick it to him. Makes me feel better about sleeping my comfortable bed. Where are we going? I told you. Just trust me. This guy is the best. You always had some local hero or urban legend you couldn't wait to show me. - Hey. - Hey. - What's up? - What's up, man? Officer Bishop. This is Jan, this is my friend Jan. What did I do to deserve you two tonight, huh? It was like the world wasn't a dark place anymore 'cause you had this light that made everybody else around you shine. - He's a musician hot dog man. - Why'd you come here? - Yeah. - For a dog and a song. And that's the man I fell in love with. ♪ Hot dogs and whiskey makes me feel frisky ♪ ♪ Holding her hand on a Saturday night ♪ ♪ Said hot dogs and whiskey, maybe she'll kiss me ♪ ♪ Looking into her eyes in the cold moonlight ♪ That's the man I wanna spend the rest of my life with. And I know you're still there. We used to stay up all night laughing at each other's stories, and now, we barely speak. I wanna find a way to start over and remember the people we used to be. You never told me your pet peeve. Oh, yeah, I don't have any. Come on, you must have one. No, I'll do it in a second. Will. Hey, hey, hey. It's a car. It's a car. I hate what this job has done to you. Jan, I can't drag you into this. You're not dragging me into anything I'm not already in. I'm your wife. There's people screaming outside of our house. Tell me what's going on. - You don't understand. - Oh, I don't understand. I've been married to you for five years, I don't understand. What do you want me to say? Don't you get it? I don't want you here! You can't fix this! Just leave me alone. I love you, Will, and you have to pull yourself outta this. If you won't talk to me, talk to Wilkins. I love you too. Hello? Okay. Okay, okay, calm down. What did he say? No, no, no. He loves you. He's probably still drunk. Just try and let him sleep it off. Yeah, we'll go together in the morning. Okay? I'll call you in the morning. Try to get some rest. Is Jan all right? She's a mess. I mean, you know, the protestors were outside her house all day, and then... This swatting thing has really got Bishop pretty fucked up. What are you gonna do? I don't know. People want me choose sides. I can't. Come on, babe, let's try to get some rest. Come on. Come on, Bishop. They're up in the tower. Someone's gotta get them outta there. We gotta get around. I hear voices inside. I'll try calling him again. Hey, it's Wilkins. We're just here to help. He's not answering. He's probably passed out, honestly. Listen up, everyone. I'm sorry for the inconvenience, but the store will temporarily close at this time. I'm here on an official police investigation, so you come back in an hour. Sorry for the inconvenience. Thank you. I shouldn't have left him last night. A suspect is still at large. We know his phone number originates from this carrier, but I need his address. Now, I spoke to your supervisor and he said you can get it for me no problem. I should call someone first. I've never done - anything like this. - This is an emergency. One man is already dead. We don't have time, do you understand that? Yeah, just give me a sec. Okay, the name on the account is Beverly Miller. Thank you. What's it say? I wish I could bring back the man you fell in love with. When I look in the mirror some days, I see the same stranger as you. I'm sorry for everything I said, I didn't mean a word of it. I wasn't strong enough to open the door, and I'm sorry for that. Remember us smiling. Ah, shit. It needs a password. Have you seen him like this before? Drunk, yes. But not like this. Okay, you're in. Oh, he's looking for the gamer. I gotta call this in. Shit. I'm just gonna need an address. I can find him. I can find him. Police Department! Good morning. I'm Officer Bishop. Hope I didn't wake you. No, no. It's okay. I'm here investigating a homicide. Sorry, I didn't get your name. Chase Miller. All right, Chase. Do you know anyone who goes by the name of ChayMoney? No. I don't. Sorry. What are you doing?! Stop! You know what you did! - It was just a prank call. - A prank?! A fucking prank?! I'm sorry! Do you know what you did? Do you have any fucking idea how many lives you ruined that night with your fucking prank call?! Available units, we have a domestic dispute in progress. Do you know what you did?! Do you have any fucking idea?! Suspect is armed and hostile. People are dead because of you! We were the first ones on the scene. Somebody's gonna get killed! How were we supposed to know the call was fake, huh? What's your ETA on SWAT? SWAT is five minutes out. Say something! Please, it was an accident. I didn't mean to. I'm sorry! No, no. No, no, no. It was just a... Listen. Listen! I didn't know that was gonna happen. I didn't mean for any of it to happen! I'm sorry. Shut the fuck up. His name was Andre Hughes. Look at him. Look at him! He's dead! He was a husband, father, teacher, coach. He's gone. You said it was a hostage situation. You said he was armed. I heard him yelling from the street. Let's go! Come on! I thought he was holding his family hostage. That's what you said! What the fuck was I supposed to think? Why would you do this? Tell me why! Why?! I'm sorry, it was a... It was the wrong house. It was supposed to be this guy online. People do it all the time. We were just playing games. Do you know what you did? Do you have any fucking idea?! Yeah, keep talking shit. Kill all of you, except you, Grinch. I'll make you my bitch. You don't know me. I'll show up with my AR. Oh, fuck! That's right. Suck a dick, motherfucker. Hey, Justin Bieber, where you at, man? Come on, bring it. This dude thinks he's hard. Keep talking shit, man. You guys suck. If teams were even, we would fuck you up. Fuck me up, you haven't fucked anything. Beat your ass, bro. Beat my ass, only thing you beat is your own dick, virgin. You gonna let him talk to you like that, man? Tell him what's up. Where you from? I'm from L.A., but stay at your mom's otherwise. I'll come fuck you up with these hands. Where do you live? I'll send some of my squad to come fuck you up. Wouldn't be the first time. Squad with the Mousketeers? I've killed before in Afghanistan. You've killed before? What, did you go on a fucking high school trip? Suck a dick. Bunch of fags in L.A. Talk that shit in Arizona, you'll get fucked up. I'll drive down, put one in you tonight if you keep talking. 14 Independent Square, bitch. Oh, damn. This guy fucking challenged you, dude. You should SWAT him. Fuck this cock, dude. He doesn't even think you'll do it. Think this muppet gave me his real address. What an idiot. Yo, do you still have that shitty prepay phone? - Yeah. - Oh, perfect, dude. Use that. Yeah, just gimme a second. I gotta find the police number for L.A. All right. What a fucking dumb ass. You know, dude, we should record his stream so we can upload it. Oh, shit. Fucking hilarious, man. Can you imagine? Okay, shut up, dude. I'm dialing. Shut the fuck up. 9-1-1. What's your emergency? Shit. Shit. Just try to remain calm, sir. What is your emergency? I... Start by giving me your name and your address. Don't tell me what to do. Don't you ever tell me what to do, you understand? Sir, yes, I understand. But how can I help you? I won't let her take my kids. She can't take them. They're mine. Sir, I need to know where you are so that I can send help. 14 Independence Square. I'll shoot her if she leaves. You have to stop her. If she tries to take my kids, I'll fucking kill her. Where are you now? In the kitchen. Okay. And where is she? In the closet. Are you sending someone? Yes, officers have been dispatched. Now, I'm gonna need you to stay on the- Yes. Oh, shit. What do you think it's like to pull a gun on someone? Is this what it's like in your fucking game? It's hard to breathe, your heart races? Can you hear it pounding in your ears? I heard a glass break, a girl scream, he was yelling. I had to do something! They say, "Stick to the facts." He was angry, he had a weapon, he didn't respond to instructions. The fuck was I supposed to do?! He took his last breath, scared and alone, without anyone who loved him. - And you stole him from them. - No justice, no peace! - They deserve justice. - No justice, no peace! - No justice, no peace! - You did this to him. - Fucking say it. - No justice, no peace! No justice, no peace! - You killed him. - No justice, no peace! - Say it! - No. Look at me. Look at me! You killed him! I didn't kill anyone! - No justice, no peace! - Say it! - I said say it! - No justice, no peace! I'm fine! Call it in! This is Unit 451. Shots fired. Suspect down. We need an ambulance. Repeat, shots fired. Suspect down. Police! Get on the fucking ground! What?! FBI! Clear? Hello? This is Federal Agent Mayo. Is anyone home? Kitchen. Here. All right. Clear. Officer Bishop? Stay close. FBI. Stay on it. Clear. Ready. - Cover me. - Mm-hm. On three. One. Two. Three. We got a body! Where's Officer Bishop?! I don't know. Where is he, you little shit?! I don't know. God dammit. What do you want, man? Sir, I want you and your family to know exactly what happened that night. Well, if you're here for forgiveness, I think it's best you leave. No, that's not my intention at all. Andre was a better son than I could've ever asked for, and you took him, you took him from us. You know what it's like raising a son to fear the people who are supposed to protect him? You know what it's like to live with that fear? Huh? Papa Al? Who's at the door? Oh, it's the cop. He wants to tell us what happened, tell us how he killed my son. Ain't that what you wanna do? Papa Al? Let him in. And when Andre opened the door that night and saw me, I panicked. I saw his jersey and his tattoos, and he had a broken bottle in his hand. I was scared. I judged what I saw and I shot him - on his way to the trash. - Oh! - Just stop it. - Come on. Let's go, let's go. Come on, let's get some air. Come on, now. I just wanted you to know the truth. Your husband was a good man. I took his life. And I know there's nothing nothing I can do to bring him back. And I'm so sorry for that. Mm. Andre is gone because of you. You killed my husband. And now, you just walk in here and apologize, and expect for everything to be over? Why is it always us? What do you see when you look at us? I mean, it's not anything new. But everyone always wants us to accept your apologies and move on. I won't do it. I'm sorry, Sergeant. I fucked up. Glad you called. People of the State of California versus William Bishop. Case number BA19107. The matter is here for arraignment. All parties are present. I've reviewed the evidence in this case as well as the obstruction of justice charge against Chase Miller. Absolutely senseless. Tragic. These are the words that come to mind on a case the details of which I've never seen this before. Will the defendant please rise? Mr. Bishop, your attorney has indicated it is your intention to enter into a not guilty plea to count one of this complaint, voluntary manslaughter, a violation of Penal Code section 192, subsection A. Correct? Yes. Is that correct, Mr. Bishop? No. No, Your Honor. Counsel, what's going on here Your honor, may I have a moment to speak with my client? Yes. You can't do this. You need to plead not guilty. Do you understand the risk you're putting on the department? This is a complicated case. No jury will find you guilty. - I made up my mind. - Your honor, if we could have a short recess? I would like to speak with my client. Your honor, I'm guilty of the charges against me. Mr. Bishop, sir, this is your arraignment. It's unheard of to enter into a guilty plea at this time. Are you sure that's what you want to do, sir? Yes, Your Honor. Mr. Bishop, do you waive and give up your right to a jury trial, the right to confront and cross-examine witnesses, and to present evidence and testimony on your own behalf? Yes, I give up my right, Your Honor. Let the record reflect that the defendant willingly, knowingly, and understandably has entered into a plea of guilty to the charge of manslaughter. The clerk will have him initial and sign a formal plea agreement. Counsel, do you waive time for sentencing? Yes, Your Honor. Formal sentencing will be held one week from today. Mr. Bishop, your OR status is hereby revoked. Bailiff, he is to be remanded into custody forthwith. We're done here. Court's adjourned. You just hung yourself and the department. Nice. Bishop. I'm floored. I'm floored. Listen, just talk to Jan. You can't just leave her like this. I don't know what to say to her. She still loves you. Thank you. I'm sorry. This is the right thing. I love you. I love you. Oh, god.
