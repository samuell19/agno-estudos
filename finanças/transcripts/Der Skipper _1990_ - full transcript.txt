[SONAR PINGING] -Richard! [SCREAMING] -Hans, Hans, Hans! Hailing Yacht Bella Donna. Hailing Yacht Bella Donna. Delta, Echo, Bravo, Foxtrot! Delta, Echo, Bravo, Foxtrot. Man overboard. My position is 33 degrees, 21 minus 4, 8 degrees, 41 minus 1. MAN (ON RADIO): Hailing Yacht Bella Donna. Delta, Echo, Bravo, Foxtrot. Do you read me? Do you read me? [SONAR PINGING] -Paul Pelikan. A friend of yours? He wanted to go fishing a week ago at Cadiz. -Paul was an ardent deep sea fisherman. -Your wife knew him also? -The three of us have been good friends for years. -Hm. Good. Tell me what happened. -We had two days of bad weather. But on the third day, things got worse. The sea was rough. The waves really hit us hard from behind. I just had time to see Paul at the stern being ripped overboard. I threw him a lifesaver as quick as I could but-- -Do you believe that story? -Why not? -Oh, we've been friends for years. Everybody knows that that Paul was her lover. -One, two, three. -What are you going to do now? -Take her out. I'm taking her out to sea again. What's the point in staying here? MAN 1: Got you this time, huh? MAN 2: Yeah, this time, right? -Goodbye. -Bye. -It was an accident. I'm sorry. -Why did you say sorry? -When I-- Mona, please. [WHISTLE] -Hey, you two. Behave. -Why should we? -I know what you're up to. -You're just jealous. Come on. Let's go. -Bloody rain. -Inspection tour? -And maintenance. -That's just what I need on a day like this. -To your health. -Well, Skipper. And when are you putting out to sea? -Tomorrow. I'm taking her out tomorrow. What's the point of sticking around here? -Come on. -He's a very busy man. He has lot of appointments. I mean, it isn't easy to talk to him in peace and quiet. But it looks good for the two of you. Don't worry. Just yesterday he told me he would consider it. You'll see. He'll do me the favor. He'll take you along. -But when? When will you know more details? -Tomorrow. Maybe the day after. I don't want to push him, you understand. I mean, he's right in the middle of a huge deal. But you can count on me. I'll find the right moment. You don't have to worry. You'll get your ship. Oh. Maybe my mates will know more tomorrow. -Bastard. Lou! -Still raining. So what did he say? -It looks good. he said he'd be meeting the captain tomorrow. -But he's been saying that for a week now hasn't he? -Well, you would know better. I'll tell you one thing though. You're beginning to get on my tits. Oh, stupid bugger didn't even bother to shave. Oh. -Louie, come on. -Su? -Yeah. -David said they'd loan us the money for tickets home. -What? Why the fuck do I go around with you? How could I be so stupid? -Ow! -Do you think I'd be shagging these blokes here, if all I wanted to do is to get back there? I'm never going home, and that's that. When I die, it's not going to be in fucking Leeds. You do what you want, but you leave me out of it! All right? -It was just a thought! Su, wait for me! Su! Su! -Now, ladies and gentlemen, time for something special. Two beautiful girls from England. Let's give them a great big hand. May I present Su and Lou! -(SINGING): You showed me the way to reach the moon. But all too soon. The sky turned dark and empty. And I cannot see. You're leaving me. Lonely, I wake up and think of you. What can I do? Those arms that hold me tight are now no longer free. You're leaving me. All the tender words you whispered to me only, your sweet embrace, were they all lies? All I have to give, so why not come and save me? I cannot bear your leaving me. You're leaving me. You're leaving me. Can't you see the sun don't shine above without your love? My hate is deep and endless like the open sea. You're leaving me. Memories are drifting through my mind of happy times. I never dreamt I'd wake up one fine day to see you're leaving me. All the tender words you whispered to me only, your sweet embrace, were they all lies? All I have to give so why not come and take me? I cannot bear your leaving me. You're leaving me. You're leaving me. -Take them off. Take them off. Take them off. Take them off. Take them off. Take them off. Take them off. Take them off. Take them off. Take them off. Take them off. Take them off. -Take them off. Take them off. Take them off. Take them off. Take them off. Take them off. Take them off. -Well, come on. -Hey. -Take them off. Take them off. Take them off. Take them off. Take them off. -No. -Take them off. [MUSIC PLAYING] [WOLF WHISTLING] -I want you to collect the money for me. -Yeah, sure. -All right, come on now, boys. Dig deep into your pockets. Show them you like them. You don't get something for nothing. Be generous. Let's see some of your money, OK? Let's help these beautiful girls, these great artists. Don't be stingy, boys. Come on. Let's see some money. OK, people. Giving is better than taking. -Well, bugger me. You're something else taking all your clothes off right out there in front of God and everybody. -I know. We got a lot? -Yes, we have. What do you think? What's your grade? -That's the prettiest song I've heard in years. I've had feelings like that. When I'm out in a storm alone with my boat and the sea. -What? You've a boat, have you? -A ship, Yeah. It's out there. -What? It's a yacht, is it? -Out there you learn what life's all about. -What do you say, Capitano? You going to treat us to a drink? A drink to love? -Next round's on me! -Meet the girl! [SINGING] [SINGING] -Oh look. There he is, Lou. Yoohoo, Skippy! Hello! We're here. Oh, he looks a bit funny, doesn't he? -I'm only taking the bare essentials. You ran out too early, but Lou saw you go in. You got time for a Coke? Want a Coke? -Yeah, I'll have a diet, please. Thanks. Willy, come here. -Two Cokes, please. Thank you very much. -Come on. You don't mind if we bring the dog, do you? It's just that it's got used to me by now, and I can't leave him behind, can I? -Oh, my feet. oh. Oh. -What the hell is going on? -It was really nice last night, wasn't it? -Yeah, we really enjoyed it. -What's this supposed to mean? You couldn't possibly be thinking of leaving. No. You can't do this to me. You have to think about Club California. Where are you girls going to all of a sudden? -We're going to Barbados with him, the Skipper. [LAUGHTER] -Come on, then. -Come on, Willy. -He can't tell the difference between port and starboard anymore. -Did you hear that? -I'm putting out to sea. -He's been saying the same thing every day for half a year now. Tomorrow I'm putting out to sea. He doesn't intend to sail again. Not while there's a drop of booze left to drink there. -What? Is that true? -He's all worn out-- no more strength, no more pride. He's out of it. He can't sail anymore. Leave him alone. As long as his money holds out, nobody will notice it. But somewhere along the line, he'll have to sell his boat. End of the line-- I've seen plenty of men in situations like this. In the end, they just go down to the beach and swim out to sea. -I'm not selling my ship. And I'm not swimming out to sea. I'm sailing to Barbados today. Let's go. we've got plenty to do. -Bye. -Bye. -Get off. Get off, Su. -Come on. Hurry up. Come on! [CHUCKLING] -Look. Ah yes. I never believed his story. -Doesn't make any difference anymore. -You know, I'll bet you that within two or three days, he'll be back. -Who? The skipper and the dog? [CHUCKLING] -Hey, it's unlucky for the captain to shave at sea. -Do you want to run around looking like a tramp? You've got ladies on board. -Oh, then those ladies better pay attention now, OK? -We don't want to. -The automatic pilot keeps us on course by itself. It's set right. -Right. -That's the windvane up there. -Right. -The compass is astern, next to the rudder wheel. -Right. -And there's a little black button there which starts the motor. -Keep still. -Now, for example, we're sailing exactly 250 degrees almost west, southwest. -How long will it take us to actually get to Barbados? -About four weeks. -Are the Fiji Islands any closer? -They're in the Pacific. We are in the Atlantic. -Oh, what's the difference? They all wear grass skirts and drink coconut milk and dance the hula hula. Hula hoop! Hula! Come on, Lou. Let's do our Hula for the Skipper. -I don't even remember it. -Yes, you can. Come on. -Hula hoop, hula hoop-- everybody's doing the hula hoop. Your brother, your sister-- no, no, no. We're practicing hula now, and you're not excused. -Go on back and you can dance as well. Hula hoop. Hula hoop. Everybody's doing the hula hoop. -Hula. What are you girls planning to do in Barbados? -We'll worry about that when we get there. [LAUGHTER] -No! No! No, you're not stronger! -Yes, we are! -Not stronger! -We're stronger. -OK, you're stronger. I give up. -I'm exhausted. -This is the life, eh? It seems a bit strange being here along with two girls. Su and Lou, they're like Siamese twins. What made me agree to this? The old man and two chicks. I'm just not used to people anymore. Hey. According to weather reports, it'll be best to sail to Barbados via Madeira. No problem. There's enough food and supplies on board. But what about the three of us? Somehow I don't trust all the peace and quiet. It wouldn't be the first time the Atlantic had a surprise for us. -Su, Su! -Determination, it's four letters. -You got any letters yet? Ends in T. -Could be "grit." -No. One, two-- yeah. Aren't you bored? -No. Why should be? -Everything OK, Willy? Your first Atlantic crossing. The dog's life, eh? -Just think. Three days ago we'd never have thought that we'd be lying here-- under the sun on our way to Barbados. -Well, I did. You were the one who wanted to go to the embassy and get your ticket back home and all that rubbish. -I know, but I never dreamt we'd end up here, did I? Just think. If I hadn't saw the Skipper at The California. -You'd have thought they-- I don't know-- -I'm surprised we didn't see him before, really. -I saw him. I just wasn't interested. -Wow. Is it hot enough for you? -You girls better watch out. When the wind is blowing, you don't notice how hot the sun is. Drink a lot and start taking salt tablets. -Do you want something to drink? -Mhm. -Mm. I love the smell of cigar smoke. -I'm going to hit the sack for four hours. Don't forget to keep a sharp watch. You're welcome to take turns, but one man has always got to take the watch. If you notice anything funny, let me know. -It's one girl. One girl has to keep watch. You said one man. We're not men. We're women, in case you haven't noticed. -Something in the water. Shit. Have you got eyes in your heads? I told you to wake me if you saw anything. -We were looking, but there was nothing there. -Oh, come on. Watching out means watching out. This is not a pleasure boat. -It'll be night soon. -I overdid it. -I told you to be careful. Where else? -Lou's all yours. -Hm. Stop behaving like that. -I'll behave any way I bloody well please. -Wow. It's lovely. Su, come and look at this. It's fab. -You see that sort of thing less and less nowadays. -How am I supposed to get some sleep with all this racket up here? -Why should you worry about her? -Why? Why? Why not? Why did you take her with me back in Gibraltar? -The mood. I drank a little too much. Maybe, maybe not. SKIPPER (VOICEOVER): Fourth day, 111 nautical miles. Barometer has dropped to to 761 in three hours. Expect wind force six to seven. This afternoon's catastrophe was a warning. I can't depend on either of them. Besides, Su is starting to get annoying. Lou is at least cooperative. But I don't know what to expect from her. Is she my friend? Is she my foe? Still waters run deep. -Come on. Give me a hand. -Lou! Lou! Lou! Lou! Lou! -Su. What is it? We're just taking down a sail? Well, do you want something? -Patience. You'll see. You'll feel better in no time. That's what I call a quick recovery -Oh. -Su, what are you doing here? -I'm here. I'm here too. So at least look at me. -I have things to do. -Lou! Lou! -Tell her if she keeps on being such a pain in the ass, I'll throw her overboard! -If he ever touches me again, from now on I'm stopping everything-- water, salt, perfume-- I want him to sick. I want him to think he's kissing a dustbin. You think I'm joking, don't you? -No, of course not. -Shall I get you something to eat? -No, so I can get sick again? -Look, I'll get you something to drink. -Look, just don't sacrifice yourself, OK? Just buzz off and leave me alone! -Like it? -I know it hurts, but I've decided to go with Paul. Don't try and stop me. It wouldn't work. It was right out in the middle of nowhere-- the only beauty salon for ladies. I suppose that makes me a lady. What that place really was was a sick clinic. We really knew our job though-- putting the hair up in curlers, makeup, shampoo, dye job, bleach, and all the stories those frustrated old hens wanted to hear. The dirtier the story, the better they liked it. They used to get hot flashes just listening to us. They'd come back a week later and tell us they tried it out. -The wind is changing and I'm going to reset the sail. -Su, but that's not like you at all? Where'd you think of this one? -Why not? I fancied a change. What do you think, Skipper? Do you like it? -Sure, why not? -Sure, why not? Unlucky in gambling, but lucky in love. Or are you a loser there too? If you're the winner, then I'm happy to lose. Careful with those cigarettes, otherwise I'll make a no smoking zone down here. And no more messing with this radio. -What's going on down here? -He can't admit he's a loser. That's why he's playing the boss. Yes, boss? -The sun really isn't good for you. [SCREAM] Listen, you may not realize how long four weeks can be. Somehow, we ought to try to get along. I'll be back in two hours, and I expect to find everything cleaned up. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Don't look at me. Your girlfriend did it. [BARKING] -Scheisse. Damn it. Unknown freight on my bow, attention. This is Sailing Yacht Bella Donna, Delta Echo Bravo Foxtrot. We're on collision course and I'm on the sail. So please give me the right of way. Over. Lou, come over here and repeat that message over and over again. LOU: But Skipper, I don't-- hello? We're on a collision course. It's the Bella-- [ENGINE STALLING] -Come on. Lou, get the flashlight. Battery's half empty from that fucking music of yours and the god damn refrigerator. [MOTOR STARTING] Keep that light steady. [ENGINE STALLING] [HORN] Get inside. Close the door. -Oh, no. [COUGHING] Oh, god. Lou? Lou, I don't feel very well. Can I get under the covers with you? -Don't be such a baby. -Lou. Please, what's the matter? -Absolutely nothing. [CHATTERING] [LAUGHTER] SKIPPER: Hey, come over here. LOU: Stop it. Su, come on in. The water's lovely. -Come on. Don't be such a killjoy. Come on on. LOU: Come on in. Listen, when we get to Barbados, we can absolutely hula hula hoop. -Anything you say. LOU: Su. Ah! Get-- help! He's drowning me! Help! Get off. -Let's go back. -All right. I'll give you a race. Give me a head start. -OK. Go. Go. Now. -Go away. -Let's go. -Where's the ladder gone? [ENGING STARTING] -Su! Su! -Well, where is it? -Stay calm. Don't panic. Su! Su! Let down the ladder. stop the motor. Are you crazy? Su! -Su, please come back. Help! Help! Please come back! -Calm down. Calm down. Breathe deeply. Calm down. Su! Su! Breathe deeply, OK? Su! Su! Come on. Sit down. Are you all right? Yes? Sure? -Cardinal virtue, eight letters, and ends in I-T-Y. Fourth letter's S. "Chastity." OK. So maybe you two can't take a joke, but don't ever do that again, not ever. Maybe he can sail a boat, and maybe you can start an engine, but when push comes to shoves, he's no good for you. And just you remember that. Fuck. -What do you say we turn back? -Turn back? -That'd be the best thing for us. Look at us. Somehow, we just don't fit together. Another three weeks of this. -But we wanted to go to Barbados. -You don't know what it's all about. You think you're mentally your own person, but the reality of it is you imitate everything. And I don't want a copy. I know it hurts, but I've decided to go with Paul. Don't try and stop me. It wouldn't work. Can you afford to turn back? It's all up here. One thing that interests me though. Her hair was bleached, weren't it? What do I have to do to make you realize? He murdered her. -What? What are you talking about, Su? You talk nothing but crap these days. -Oh, you're sure about that, are you? Take a lot at this. Look. Here's the Dear John letter. In it, Mona says she doesn't want to see him anymore, you know. She wants a separation. It's always the same thing. She can't handle it with him. Look at these pictures. He's cut himself out of every one he's in with her. -Su, you're stupid. This doesn't mean nothing. Maybe he just didn't want to be reminded of happier times. -Oh, if only that were it. While you've been moping around, I've been doing some detective work, and I found out everything. He's a killer and an idiot. He doesn't know we're onto him. Look. Mona's dress, underwear. I mean, why didn't she take this stuff with her? And why put that man's gear in the aft cabin? And look. I mean, it's hardly used, any of it. Is this the kind of stuff you leave behind? There's only one reason why somebody wouldn't take something like this with them. It was him. Here on this boat. And he's a druggie too. I found two used needles in the dustbin. I knew there was a reason I wouldn't let him near me right from the start. -Su, there's probably a perfectly reasonable explanation for all this. -Oh, you're beyond help. What more evidence do you need? Does he have to do you in and then me? -Shh. Skipper. Skipper, wake up. Come on, wake up, Skipper. I don't mind if you did kill her. -What? -Your wife and your friend. -I didn't kill anyone. But Paul, it just happened. That's why Mona left me. She blamed it on me. I should have saved him. But I couldn't. -I believe you. What about Su? -What about Su? -Well, nothing. Nothing about Su. -Willy, you slob. Yo. Next time, you shit overboard, OK? -What? What's happening? -Don't be afraid, Lou. -What's the matter, Skipper? You blow your cork last night? Hey, leave our gear alone. -Where's my serum? -Where's your what? -My serum. Ampules. They were in the fridge. Now they're gone. OK. Where are they? I've got to give myself a shot. -Well, how should we know? You really should keep an eye on your own stuff. Do you know where it is? Well, what does it look like? Shots? Are you some kind of addict? I know you're mad, and a pervert, but a junkie too? Oh, what are we coming to? -Well, I can tell you exactly. First, the weak spells. Then dizzy spells. The sugar count rises. At 250, I get the chills. Five hours later, paralysis. At 450 or 500, the cellular walls break. The potassium sodium balance goes on a merry-go-round. After 8 to 12 hours coma, that's it. Now, where is that serum? -Maybe you'll find your stuff before you reach 500 or 600. Or maybe you'll just have to turn that little helm of yours around, and go like the clappers to the next island. [SCREAM] No! He's going to kill me! Get off me! Get off me! Lou, help me! Get off me! Get off me! Stop it! -Where is my insulin? Where did you hide it? -Skipper, you've gone mad. Leave her alone. Go! Get off! Get off of her! -Once you remember where my insulin is, I'll pull you back in. [SCREAMING] -Skipper, wait. You don't understand. She can't swim. She doesn't know how to swim. -It's the quickest way to learn. -I promise you, just please, please. She'll give it back, so just please. -She has no alternative. If it's the end of me, it's the end of her as well. -No, This is stupid. You've gone mad. She'll give it back to you. SU: Help me, Lou. -I need help. Is there a ship in the area with medical equipment? I am in urgent need of depo insulin. LOU: Su. -Where is it? -I don't see any land. -Don't. -I'll give you one hour. -Give it back to him. Give it back to him, Su. Give it back to him. -Or what's he going to do with me? -Oh, give him back his serum! -Oh, leave me alone. Fucking hell. -You're wankers, the pair of you-- driving me fucking mad. No, Skipper, please don't. Why don't you just drop us off at the nearest island? Then you'd be rid of us. You know we drive you mad. I promise. If I go with her, it'll be the end of everything. -Madeira lies two days behind us. It's too late to go back. A tanker. A tanker! A tanker has medicine on-board. -But there's nothing there. Skipper, look. There's nothing there. You've gone mad. -Help! -Skipper, no! SKIPPER: Help! LOU: No! Skipper! -Yes? Do you know what I dreamt last night? That you got married. But it wasn't a real wedding in a church. It-- it was more like a party. And someone said, hey, come in the kitchen. Lou's getting married. And I laughed and said, what a load of rubbish. My best friend would never marry a cripple. -Skipper! -Stupid bitch. I wouldn't have let him die, you know. -You have to help me. -Me? -Please, you have to. -I can't do that. -Please. Put on the needle. Take off the cover. Take one of those ampules with the red ring on it. Take the ring off. Stick the needle into the rubber. Press the air out. Now pull back the insulin. Slowly. That's enough. Point the syringe outwards, and press out the insulin until there's 25 milligrams left. 25. That's right. Now, inject the insulin into me. -Oh, no. I couldn't do that. -You have to. Do it. Thanks. [MOANING] -Lou. Don't leave me alone. Please. -Come here. -(SINGING) You showed me the way to reach the moon. But all too soon. The sky turned dark and empty. And I cannot see. You're leaving me. Lonely, I wake up and think of you, you, you. What can I do, do, do? These arms that hold you tight are now forever free. You're leaving me. All the tender words you whispered to me only, your sweet embrace, were they all lies? All I have is you so why not come and take me? I cannot bear your leaving me. You're leaving me. You're leaving me. Can't you see the sun don't shine above without your love. -Cheers. -(SINGING) My pain is deep and endless like the open sea. You're leaving me. Memories are drifting through my mind of a happy time. -Have a glass of champagne. SU: (SINGING) I never dreamt I'd wake up one fine day-- [SCREAM] -Wh-- wh-- wh-- what have you done? What have you done? -What? Su, what is it? -Get away from me! Hello? This is-- this is the Bella Donna. Come help me. My name is Su. She-- she murdered him. She murdered him. [SINGING] -Oh god. Oh god. [SCREAM] -Su. Su? Su, I can't open the door. Su? Open this door. -Go away! [SCREAM] -Why are you staring at me like that? SU: Why did you do it? -What? -Why did you murder him? -You said that he didn't fit in with us. You know he didn't. How could he? He was a man, wasn't he? -You killed him. -Look. Even you said that he could start the engine, but he couldn't sail the boat, right? You said that he killed Mona. That he was going to kill us next. I think you were right. -But-- but I wouldn't have murdered him. I-- I didn't mean that. LOU: Shh. It's all right. -I didn't mean that. -Don't upset yourself. Look here, love. It's going to be just the two of us now. You know, just the Su and Lou like it always used to be. What is it? Don't worry. Now that the Skipper's gone, we're going to go back to just what we used to always be like. -You murdered him. -No, I didn't. -You murdered him! -No, I didn't, Su. -You murdered him! You murdered him! You murdered him! -Don't do that to yourself! Su! Don't! Shut up! Shut up! Shh. Stop it, Su. Shh. Shut up. Shh. Shh. Just don't shout, all right? [KETTLE WHISTLE] [ENDING THEME]
