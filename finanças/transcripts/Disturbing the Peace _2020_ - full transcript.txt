Take the shot, Steve. Did you hear Mayor Cockran is going to double the parking fines later this month? He ain't the mayor yet. You feeling all right? Why wouldn't I be? Catie told me you stopped by the bar last night? Let me tell you something right now. I don't like people keeping tabs on me, okay? I made a fresh pot of coffee, Marshal. Thank you. She said you had some bad news. Yeah. Who was Steve Lucas? Steve was a Texas Ranger. He was my partner until I shot him. What happened? We were serving a felony arrest warrant just outside of Dallas. Suspect got the jump on him. Your partner gets taken hostage, you do not give up your weapon, otherwise, you'll both end up dead. - But how did you... - Steve was being held from behind. He called out his name to me which was a signal that he was gonna drop and then I was to take the shot. But the kidnapper must have suspected something. My bullet left Steve paralyzed from the neck down. He lay in a hospital bed for 10 years. He died last week. Never got to touch his wife or hold his kids ever again. Is that why you don't carry a gun? I've not picked up a weapon since. But, like I said, I don't like people keeping tabs on me, okay? I'm gonna go make this deposit. Say hi to that new teller. What new teller? What do you figure they're doing all the way out here? Breakfast maybe. Yeah. Thank you, Catie. I didn't see you Sunday, Mr. Bozeman. I know, and I'm sorry. I was just feeling a bit poorly. But I heard you gave a good sermon. It's all right. We're not judged by how many sermons we sit through. But I sat through some rough ones in my time. Ain't that the truth? Phillip, you're my campaign manager. It's your job to press my contributors. - I need a war chest. - A war chest? What for? Nobody else is gonna file. Closing date's not for a week. Who you afraid of? Jim Dillon? Afraid he'll throw his hat in the ring? I'm not afraid of anybody, especially, not Jim Dillon. - Give me a beer. - Sorry, sir. We don't serve alcohol till after 5:00 PM. I didn't ask what you were serving. I told you to get me a beer. I told you we're not serving beer till after 5:00 PM. Let go. What's going on here, fellas? - Nothing much, Officer. - Yeah? Don't look like nothing to me. Stay down, son, or I'll give her another run at you. You need to get out. You okay? - Hey, Amanda. - Hey, Matt. - How are you? - Good. How are you? - Hanging in there. - Good. - Hot outside. - Yeah. So I was thinking on my walk over here, would you wanna have dinner with me next week? Don't you have a girlfriend? No. I did, but I don't now. That's been over for quite a while. Oh. I'll think about it. Great. - You got nothing on me, man. - Sit down. I was defending myself. I need you to run this prisoner to county lockup by yourself. - By myself? - Yeah. I'm staying here. What's wrong? These boys are riding into town, starting a fight with only of them involved. The other one just watching on. Don't make sense. Can you get him processed? Let's go. Where you taking me? Watch your head stepping inside, sir. I'll expect you back here by noon. - Just a minute, Marshal. - Councilor. I wanna talk to you about what happened at the diner. I saw you hiding in the corner. That was a god safe place to be. I'm talking about last night when you were drinking. I was off duty. As town marshal, you're always on duty. - What do you want, Rogers? - As mayor, I'm putting you on notice. - Acting mayor. - Beg your pardon? You're not mayor yet. Then as acting mayor, I'm putting you on notice since you've been added to the agenda of the next board of supervisors meeting. We're gonna discus your behavior last night and this morning. Well, I'm flattered. Have a nice day, Marshal. Yeah. I'll be there in 30. - Didn't hurt you, did he? - No. He hit like a girl. Well, not a girl like you. So I was thinking... maybe you could come over later and we can ride before dark. The horses are getting a little antsy. Well, we can't have that now, can we? Definitely not. Show me that. Does it hurt? Nah. You're tough. Hello? Hello? Did your phone just die? Yeah. I'm not getting a signal. It's not the breaker. I ought to see what's going on. Look out. What the hell? Sir, can you hear me? Sir, stay put. Can you hear me, sir? Sir? Whoa, whoa. Okay. Yeah. I can hear you loud and clear, motherfucker. Can you hear me? Huh? - Okay. Wait. - Now, get in the car. - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. - Move, motherfucker. Okay. All right. All right. All right. Get in. Get the fuck in. Move your legs. Motherfucker. All right. He is three miles up. Just went 10-8 off a signal 21. Bro, seriously. What does that even mean? Back in service after a traffic stop. Two, three, one, Paul, Robert, Paul. 79 South. 10-mile marker. We got 90 minutes. Morning, ma'am. Is there something wrong, Officer? Yes, ma'am. The reason I'm stopping you is 'cause you were speeding. I need to see your driver's license, registration, and proof of insurance please. I would. What did you do? No one was supposed to get killed. You get out of here right now or you're going to be next. - Got it? - Yeah. Always a pleasure seeing you, Marshal. Now, how about you give me that radio? Put your hands up, up! - Put your hands up! - Get the fuck up, move! Go to that fucking door! Go, go, go! - Move! - Don't make me fucking shoot! Come on, move, move! Come on, get the door. Move, move, move! Hey, come on, move! - Go, go, go! - Go, go, go! Get in the window! Hands up or I'll fucking shoot! Hey, hands up! Hands! So this is where they post you after you shot your partner, huh, Marshal? Marshal James Dillon, I assume. Well, I got to tell you, I'm kind of surprised to see you here. I thought you and your partner be transferring to prison or to county together. That's the procedure, ain't it, Marshal? Who are you? Things haven't changed much around here, huh? Still the same. My name is Diablo. Not really my Christian name. It's what my friends call me. And my enemies. I guess my question to you is which one are you gonna be? Are you gonna be my friend or are you gonna be my enemy? You don't wanna hurt nobody in this town. Why, what are you gonna do? You're gonna arrest me? 'Cause I'm not going back to prison again. You're gonna have to shoot me. I don't wanna have to find out. Sounds like a threat. But I understand that's the paradigm which you operate. Simple conditioning. Well, it's kind of like... it's kind of like Pavlov's dog. You see a threat or you see a problem, you take charge, right? Well, that paradigm is no longer valid. There is a new paradigm in town... and a new marshal. From now on, you do what I want, when I want, and you might just make it out of this fine day, you understand, Marshal? I said do you understand, Marshal? I am gonna arrest you. I respect a man with confidence. Pyro, open the vault. - Come here, sweetie. - Baby. I need you to take me to your vault. I can't. Hey, hey, you fucking listen to me, okay? If you lie to me about anything, anything at all, I'm gonna get real irritated, okay? And the rest of your day... let's just say there won't be a rest of your day. The vault, it's set on a time clock. I can't open it even if I want to. Opens at noon. It's only... Okay. So two minutes away. Kind of like we knew the schedule, huh? Why don't we take a little walk. Open it. - Come on. - Okay. Now, listen, if you play any fucking games with me, I'm gonna shoot your kidney, You feel that? You don't have to worry about that. I'm not the one worrying, babe. Let's go! - It's open, it's open. - Move. Get the fuck down. Here your bitch back, Marshal. I'm sorry. Now is not the time to start feeling sorry for yourself. Lock them in the church. Move it! Come on, let's go. Stay out of that church. My, my, my. Catie Reynolds. You sure have grown up. Let's go. Do I know you? No, not really. I knew your father. Little too heavy on the fire and brimstone for my liking. But I guess that comes with a job, huh? Now I understand your back, trying to hold together this piece of shit town. What is it that you want? I guess I'm like the prodigal son that's back to collect his dues. And then you'll leave us? Not yet. There ain't nothing else to steal here. There will be in 28 minutes. That's an armored truck. First sign of trouble, they'll call the state police. We'll have to see, won't we? Put them in the vault. Hey, Candi, how are you doing? I'm dead on my feet. Well, you look great. Well, I hate working days. Nobody tips. How about I take you out to dinner? You never give up, do you? How many times have you asked me out? Eighteen now. Well, my shift started at 4:00 AM this morning. Well, how about lupper? You know, it's like brunch, but in between lunch and supper. Come on. All right. But you've got to promise to take me home early. Like 7:00 early. Okay, I'll see you at 2:00. How much this time? Fifteen million, four hundred thirty-two thousand, three hundred and twenty-two dollars. Should, could buy a lot of tacos with this kind of scrap, huh? I'm gonna ignore that racist-ass comment. But, yeah, I could buy a bunch of tacos with that money. All right, man, let's go. I got to be back before 2:00. Comm check, over. Base Alpha One, comm check, over. five by five. We're on the move. Be careful, compadre. Matt. You in the car. Hey, Big Dog get my back. Get out of the car. Get out of the car. Hey, stop. Hey. Hey, I will blow her brains all over the pavement, you hear me? I'm not fucking around. I will shoot her right now. Come up with your hands above your head, throw your weapon on the ground. Ten, nine... Test me again. Test me again. Marshal, are you listening? You and your rookie deputy? Nah, damn. We're gonna need backup. Yeah, we probably do. But for now, unfortunately, it's just you and me. Eight, seven, six, five... Stop! Stop! She's my wife! Let her go. Oh, no, Martin. What the hell is he doing? He's surrendering. That's suicide. Please. Please. No, no, no, no. - Holy shit. - Please. You're his wife? Yes. Yeah? Oh, no, no. Marshal, five... four... Matt. Three, two... One. Here we go. Pyro, go. Go. Spider. Spider. Keep moving. What the hell Jim doing out there? Trying to save us. Well, he's not doing a very good job of it. When this is over, the Town Council is gonna review Jim's contract. Really? Is not the right time for this discussion? Can't you wait until we're out of this mess before you cook up a scheme to fire Jim? This is not about firing Jim Dillon, it's about what's best for the town. Quiet as a mouse. No, Rogers, it's not. This is about you and me, and there will never be a you and me. What are we doing? Hey, listen, I need you to go out to the highway and flag down the armored truck, okay? What about you? Take these. I'm staying here. Go, just to what I tell you. Andale, andale, arriba, arriba. Jim, it's Matt. Can you hear me? I know who it is, Matt. There's a state trooper parked at the end of the county road. I'm gonna try to make contact with him and see if I can get him to call for back-up. Negative, the gang are monitoring police frequencies. Listen, why don't you tell the trooper to drive to the state police barracks and just bring reinforcements? That could take forever. What are we supposed to do until then? Don't get yourself killed. Hey, compadre, we're approaching the turnout. Siesta time is over. What the hell? Hey, why are we slowing down? State trooper up ahead. - Is it a wreck? - Don't look like it. Better not make me late. What's going on, Sir? Gas leak. Can we get in? Yeah, it's cleared up now. You'll be fine. Are you sure? Because, you know, I'd hate to get blown up. You... you'll be okay. Don't worry. All right. Jim, they got the state trooper, too. The armored truck is on its way. I'm coming back to you. Okay. You should've seen that inbreed. It looks like his parents were brother, and sister, and first cousins. Hey, well, if the state's taking in inbreeds, maybe you should apply. Ha ha. Better be cool. Hey, you seeing this? Yeah, where is everybody? Must be the gas leak. You think maybe we should head over to the backup truck? That's another 32 miles. We'll never make it back by 2:00. Okay, hotshot, don't sweat it, I'll get you back in time for your date. Here they come. Why don't you go inside first, make sure everything's cool? Maybe they closed because of the gas leak. Hey, do you think something's up? With the whole town? I'm just saying. It's your turn. It's always my turn. But something doesn't smell right. Hey, you're late. Easy, cowboy. Lopez, somebody just shot at me. Spread out. Mayday. Mayday. Mayday. Mayday. We're be... Don't make me shoot your partner. I don't have all day. Hey, man, I'm just doing my job, bro. We're all here just doing our job. Unlock the door. No. No? They just killed my partner. - Do you copy? Mayday. Mayday. - Unlock it. - We're being robbed. Mayday... - Hey, hey, hey, hey. Nobody can hear you. That shot took out your antenna. We have protocols. If I don't call in in 10 minutes... No. No. Sixty minutes. I read all your protocols. Sixty minutes after you log in, if your dispatcher can't reach or hear you, she calls local police, 60 minutes. But do you think I'm gonna let you sit in there for 60 minutes? You got a dilemma, my friend, a choice between the lesser of two evils. Option one, you open the door, you live the rest of your life with your own abject failure. Option two, you don't open the door, you die a hero. Jim, where are you? I'm just leaving my house. I'm by the feed store. I think I see someone upstairs with a rifle. I'm gonna try to break inside and check it out. Copy. But, unfortunately, I don't have all day. So you got to make a choice. Now, I know what you're doing, you're scrambling, you're trying to think of a third option, aren't you? There isn't one. There's no more. Can you hear me through this, huh? There's no more fucking options! We're all set. You see? Now it's too late. Do it. Yeah! Big Dog, load it up. Pyro, go light it. Yeah, I'm on it. - And what was Pyro lighting up? - What do you mean? We can't just let him get away. He's seen our faces. Yeah, what does that matter, all right? We're gonna be out of the country in 12 hours. Hey, no one was supposed to get hurt. No one's ever supposed to get hurt. Man, it just happens. Oh, so you're just gonna kill them all, huh? Hey, why don't you just go to every house and shoot everybody? Like you did in Iraq? Huh? Don't pretend like you're not a murderer. - That was war. - This is war! Fuck you. Ah, ah, ah, whoa. - Want me to kill him? - No, no. He'll come around. Everything's going to be okay. How do you know that? Jim and Matt are out there alone. Look at us. Come with me. Jim, where are you? Jim, it's Matt, where are you? Matt, where are you? I'm upstairs above the feed store. I took one of them out. I got his gun. It's a rifle with a scope. Okay, good. Well, stay high, see if you can make use of that weapon. Marshal? Hold your position. Fuck. You, you, Preacher's daughter, come here. - Don't you touch her. - Shut up. Marshal, he's got Catie. Matt, do not make a move. Marshal. Marshal. Hey, Marshal. Marshal. I've got somebody here that wants you to turn yourself in. You do want him to turn himself in, don't you? Huh? Hmm? Shit. I'm not fucking around, Marshal. Marshal, I can't get a shot. Matt, stand down. My associate will shoot her in the fucking face. Hey, lawman. You and your partner. You're running out of time. Marshal. Okay. All right, Marshal, that's it. Shoot her. Stop. Good decision, deputy. Don't hurt her. Shit. Hey, hey. No, no, no, no. Come here, come here. Come here. I hate this fucking town. You know that? Big Dog, come here. Go check that out. You, motherfucker. I'm gonna get you, Marshal. Son of a bitch. Get him inside. Matt. Matt. Get me another truck. Don't make a sound. Walk. Pyro, man. We need to get that fucking Marshal. No, man, we got what we came here for, right? Uh, so let's just get out of here, brother. What's that say? Huh? What's that say? Never forgive. Yeah. - Never forgive. - Okay. Inside. Why did you all come to this town? Diablo was born here. His father worked in the mine, until it closed down and he drank himself to death. Diablo hates this town. I heard him say you were a Marine. Ex. No such thing. How'd you know? I was Force Recon. Semper Fi. You ought to be ashamed of yourself. I am. Matt. Daddy had a radio. An old ham rig. It's still in his office. But you can't contact the state police on it. You don't have to. Just another ham operator and they can. All right. I'm gonna go. Matt, come in. Do you read me? Where are you? Grunt or pogue? 0311, rifleman. You took an oath once. You joined a brotherhood bound by honor, loyalty, and blood. Do you recall them? Yes, I do. I'm giving you a choice, Marine. There's one in the pipe. But I'm reminding you, you're still under arrest. Yes, sir. Any station, any station. This is Horse Cave Deputy Marshal Matt Reynolds here. Do you copy? Any station, any station. This is Horse Cave Deputy Marshal Matt Reynolds here. - Do you copy? - Horse Cave, this is AQI 709 out in Columbus. What can I help you with, Deputy? Columbus, we need back up. Multiple suspects, heavily armed. Please send reinforcements. Do you copy? Go ahead. Fall back. Where are you heading, Marshal? You can't run. Marshal. Come on, come on, come on. Hurry up, guys. Come on. Diablo, we got to go. Come on, Diablo. We got to go. We're good. We're good. Last ones. Come on. Well, the state police are coming. How do you know that? It's all over the radio. - You got to go. - All right. Trixie. Trixie. Trixie. Come on. Fuck. Are you okay? Yeah. Are you good? I believe there is only one guy left. So, it should be a piece of cake. Just in case. It was my daddy's. You think of everything, don't you? I got to go. I need you to stay safe. Yah. Yah, yah, yah. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You have a better shot nowadays. You know who's gonna be happy? Your deputy, if he's ever taken hostage. You enjoy killing innocent people? No, man. It breaks my fucking heart. You? I enjoy bringing justice to those who deserve it. Because now you're gonna kill a man at point blank range? That's justice. Maybe. Well, hello, Mr. Mayor. Linda. Hey, Jerry. Well, good morning Mayor. Ma'am. What about breakfast? The usual? No reason to change something if it's good. So are we gonna go riding tonight? Those horses getting antsy again? Maybe.
