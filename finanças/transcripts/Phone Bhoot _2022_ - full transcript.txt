This story is fictional, and bears no resemblance to reality. The story has been inspired by ancient legends and folklores. This film talks of several evil powers. For example, black magic, ghosts-spirits, and... Witches. Please don't be scared while watching this feature film. Because this film has no connection to reality. The only connection is with a sorcerer. Who, with his mystical powers, is determined to plunge the world into a dark age. However, history has borne witness, whenever the world is facing imminent doom, heroes were born for its protection. But, since all the heroes were busy. You guys will have to settle for these two. Major and Gullu. They preferred creepy ghosts over humans, by birth. But can their bizarre nature, save us from the sorcerer's plans for Doomsday? Let's see. What's wrong, Gullu? I saw a nightmare. Waking up from a nightmare is a whole lot of fun. - Lucky you. - Major, hear me out. In my dream, you were showering. Me? Showering? Must be Sunday. There was blood coming out of the shower. Lovely, man! Like how the heroine showers in Ramsay Brother's 'Purana Mandir'? Correct. And then? Then... Clean water started coming from the shower. Stop! You call that scary? That's not scary, that's unfortunate. Exactly my point, bro. It's an ominous sign. Signs that we are heading toward bad luck. Oh, sh**! Your Papa and my Appa are arriving tomorrow. (Tamil)Oh God! Death by Dads! Why are our fathers like this... They show up on the 1st of every month, and ask the same question. "What are you doing with your life? "When will you start making a living?" "When will you become independent?" Fathers are all the same. Once this New Moon Night party is a hit. Then we'll explain to them. that we've started our own event management business. And then Papa-Appa's lips will be sealed forever Sealed! Don't jinx us with your unlucky words. Every time you do, our businesses fail. Unlucky? I am not unlucky! Your ideas are unlucky. Last time, we organized a simple singing show. You said let's make the theme 'Sing-and-scare'. What is 'Sing-and-scare'? In the end, it was just us playing 'charades'. I see...and don't forget. The birthday parties we organized with the neighborhood kids. You showed up as Ghost Uncle. I had Kavita aunty totally impressed. Not one mum calls me anymore. And, your restaurant idea? What name did you come up with? "Rest In Pieces." Our bank balance was in royal pieces. What about your BhootTube? Not one subscriber you had. I did... I see... How? Sweetprincess22 That was me. Me. AngelPiya. - All me. - CatapultKing. That was me too. SixPackShakoor. That was me too. And this was me. (Tamil)Raaka - Our Lord, have mercy! Please help us. If you want-- Look, Raaka. This is your final chance to perform a miracle. If our family stops giving us money, then you'll be out on the streets with us. Raaka, it's been 10 years... Since that day when we dug you out, from the ground of the old film studio, behind the Hanuman temple on the black mountain, with our own hands, (Tamil) These very hands They wanted you to... act in Television! Raaka... we did everything possible, to make you feel at home. Look... Take a look yourself. We have complete faith. One day, you shall awaken from your spiritual slumber. And help us. O Raaka, help! Our party is a flop. No one turned up. Someone did... Two idiots in costumes, did show up. Who? Me and you! Screw... Even Raaka's eyes have lost power now? Unfortunate... It's another bad omen. We're beyond saving. Gullu. Gullu, you are alive right? Shocking! Our party is a hit. Major, let's hurry up and start charging them money, these guys got free entry. Forget the entry, look at the gentry. Awesome gals. Brother let's go. Hello. Hi, guys. Major. Hi. I am Galileo Parthasarathy. I am the organizer. So, it's two thousand for couples. Oh, nice. Full in character. But it's still 2000 for couples, and 1500 for stags. Is that all for attaining salvation? Salvation? Salvation attained. "New Moon night party." "Come and attain salvation." These days several frauds are moonlighting in the market offering salvation. Ma'am, if you think this party is a fraud, then you can leave. We have better things to-- Hi, Major. - Major? - Yes. From the army? He's not a real Major. Well...my real name is Sherdil Shergil, but my nickname is Major. Major disappointment! Just because you're hot, doesn't mean you can get away with anything. There are other guests in the party. We've to attend to them as well. Take a welcome selfie and keep moving. Let's go, Gullu. Say Boooo. Yeah. Here you go. Shake well. - Let's go. - You go. "Say what's in your heart." "Come fall in love." "Put everything off for another day," "sweetheart." "Come hold my hands." "Look in my eyes." "Steal my heart, sweetheart." "You look so cute...cute...cute..." "And me...me..." "Together as a couple." "We look so cute." "You look so cute..." "And me..." "Together as a couple." "We look so cute." "So cute." "Your attitude is rare," "and this face is one in a million." "I am crazy about you," "let me announce to the world." "Can't take my eyes off you." "No one else looks good with me as you do." "My heart wants to say I love you..." "Say what's in your heart." "Come fall in love." "Put everything off for another day," "sweetheart." "You look so cute...cute...cute..." "And me...me..." "Together as a couple." "We look so cute." "The drop!" "Break" "It's a match made in heaven, can never be broken." "You're mine, and I'm made for you-you-you." "You're my heart, you're my peace of mind." "You're the one I love." "Your killer attitude," "has driven me crazy." "Can't live without you." "You're my life, you're my love." "That's how much I love you." "You look so cute..." "How cute I look." "Together as a couple." "We look so cute." "You look so cute...cute...cute..." "And me...me..." "Together as a couple." "We look so cute." What's going on here? We're partying, what else. With whom? With all these people of course. This is a private property. You need permission. Write them a ticket. That will be 5000. Short circuit? We didn't make any money, and got arrested by the police. How are we going to face our fathers? Gullu, can't get that gal from the party off my mind. Me neither. Bro, our fuse is blown. Just pray we reach home safe and sound. We don't need prayers. We need pills. Gullu-Special! Bro, what's in it? The usual... Hair from a black cat's nose. Nail of a bat, and tail of a lizard. Salt to taste. Captain Major, I'm taking a nap. Good idea, Gullu. Now the plane's gonna fly on autopilot. "Fasten your seatbelts." "The weather might get rough." "The place where this plane will land," "is haunted by a ferocious witch." "And she's flung 56 people to date," "onto the divider of death." Bro...something hit us. Yeah. It has definitely hit me. Gullu! Hurry up over here, Gullu. You ran over this widow with the car. No. We flattened the widow! Huh? No. - You... - No. - You killed a widow. - No. You are a widow killer! She's alive! - She is alive. - Alive? Her feet are moving. You twisted her feet around. No...are you okay, Widow madam? Wait a minute. Prima facie, it looks like a talofibular, calcaneofibular ligaments have in fact ruptured, causing her ankle to dislocate. It's a rare case of ATFL and PTFL tear with high degree avulsion injury. (Tamil)We have to set her bones right We have to relocate it. Meaning...twist them around? Foot Massage. Come on, go for it, Gullu. One... Two... Three! I'll do it. You have soft hands. Now behold 'Lassi' power. One... Two... Three! What the... You know what, let's both try together. - Correct. - Right. - Ready? - Ready. Come on. Counting. - One... - Mississippi. - Two... - Mississippi. - Three... - Mississippi. Houston, we just heard a woman scream. Is everything alright? God... I think she has polio. This is not polio, idiot. And anyway, India's been polio-free since 2011. Meaning, even if she had polio, it got cured in 2011. It's not some warranty, that comes with an expiry date. That's not how it works. Why are you putting pressure on your mind? Let's ask widow ma'am. Widow ma'am. Where did she go? Ma'am, it's not an MRI. You didn't have to go inside. Hello. Did you find her? No, she's not here. - She isn't here either. - Widow ma'am. Good God. - Widow ma'am. - Wait, let me try shaking it. Stop shaking it. What do we do about the widow? Scooby-dooby-doo! What dooby-doo? The widow. Where is she? - Let's call 911. - Idiot 911? That's in America. Who is there? Hello, boys. Please. Hot coffee, cold milkshake. See, Gullu, that's Major's charm. She followed me all the way here. Followed is fine, but how did she get inside? Good question. I must have given her the house keys. I noticed the way you were looking at me. The way you were hitting on me. Come. Come. Coming. Come - Coming. Coming. - Come. Shoo! Now I get it. You must have done research on me after the party. Type Gu in the browser and Gullu appears. Right? From virtual stalking, you're now stalking me for real. Major...she didn't follow you here, she followed me. I am sorry. But looking at your face, I think your last date was with your iPhone. Right? Yeah...funny. She is right. I went with Siri. Hello. Who are you? What kind of horror fans are you guys? You organise a New Moon party, but don't recognize your guest. You live in this horror-themed home, but can't recognize a ghost when you see one. Ghost? Where? Here. Where? Here you dimwits! I am a ghost! Ghost and you? Good try. But not good enough. No, it was convincing. You must have done lots of theatre. No, ghosts should be scary, but she gives me different vibes altogether. How can you be a ghost? I wish you were a ghost. They are not normal like us. Yeah...and ghosts are never so sexy. Correct. Gullu. Look, she's trying to scare us. No, no, that's comedy. Major. - Major, light. - Yeah, she's taking me lightly. - Don't take me lightly. - Major, relax. Oh yeah, baby. Yeah, relax. Eyes closed. Now breathe in, breathe out. Now breathe in, breathe out. Major, air force. - Strong breeze. Strong breeze. - Air with force. No, no, that's romantic. (Tamil) Major, this is not Romance. It's anger. She's looking like a bomb when she's angry. C'mon baby c'mon. Major...(Tamil) Look here, look there - Mummy! - Major... Major...your man's down. Gullu...what happened? She entered your body. You were inside me, baby? Are you really a ghost? Now, will you listen to me? Yes, but how can we talk if you keep drifting around? If you can 'plant your pot' in one place, then maybe... That's not in my control. Why? Because I am a wandering spirit. I don't drift, I wander. That's easy. Now, look. Go to settings, then control panel. You'll find the 'roaming' button is 'on'. Just turn it 'off'. Are you comfortable? So, what brings you here? As I said, I'm a wandering spirit. I wandered all the way to your party. Then, for the first time I came across such humans, who could see ghosts, And, weren't scared of them. I was amazed. Later, after listening to your conversation all night, I realized you two are... big losers. And that no one takes you seriously. But, I can change all that. How? I have a business idea for you two. What business idea? The idea is... I will possess people, and you two can come exorcise me out. You'll earn fame and fortune. Guaranteed success. We'll be the virus and the antivirus. Gullu... One minute. Sorry. No! But why? Why? Which decent ghost would drop in uninvited, at midnight, in a house with two strangers? We can be useless, jobless, shiftless, but we are not frauds! We'll starve to death, but never con anyone. - Correct. - But hear me out first. We don't want to hear anything. - Let's go, Gullu. - Okay. Gullu... At least you listen to me. It's a fool proof plan. I agree. It's a brilliant plan. But, as he said, we cannot cheat any human being. It's wrong. Let's go, Major. You two are making a big mistake. The list of our mistakes is pretty long. This is nothing. Which reminds me, our fathers are coming over. And anyway, they think we've wandered far away like you. So, please leave. Thank God I ran into you two. You owe me three months milk money. No money, no milk from tomorrow. Dude, we don't need your milk. Hey... Hey...you can have your coffee, black. What about my milkshake? Come back after two days. - We'll clear you. - What? I mean clear your bill. Hey...where did she go? Ms. Ghost. Has she left? I think she wandered away again. Yeah... Gullu... Are you thinking what I'm thinking? Yes, buddy How are we gonna pay the milkman? We can see ghosts! Yeah, that too. But I am proud of you. You're absolutely correct. We will not con any human. My dear Gullu, we cannot con a human being, but we can definitely con a ghost. How? By stealing her idea. Think a bit...why did we meet? Why did we dedicate all these years to horror? Why did Raaka come into our lives? Correct. Why did we get these powers? You're right. It's a sign. Years of hard work have borne fruit. Now we are gonna be... 'Ghostbusters'. Ghostbusters my foot. Booth capturing. What's this? That is only for North Indians. No, no, uncle, We're talking about ghosts and ghouls. - Goal? - No, father, that's a ghoul. - With an 'h'. - Without? Without? - Without an 'h'. - It's spelt with 'h'. - It's like this. - Wait a minute. Papa, with or without 'h'. To hell with your 'h'! Brigadier, control. (Tamil)Son, what's all this nonsense? This is a stupid idea. Not stupid, father. Genius! You see, uncle, it's like this. The number of wandering spirits is on the rise. Yes. And they are running out of places to stay. It's a real estate issue, dad. And where are they gonna stay if they run out of space? In us! In you. And who will exorcise them? Who? - Us. - Why? Because we can see ghosts. Why are you scared? No. I'm to be blamed for this. Nancy. Major's mother. As a child, when he didn't drink his milk, I used to say "drink your milk, or the ghost will come for you". When he didn't study, I used to say "do your studies, or the ghost will come for you". He wouldn't sleep. Play all day. I used to say "sleep son, or the ghost will come for you". I didn't know... ghosts would become his BFFs one day, and he'll dump his father. No, it's not your fault. It is this Raaka. He ruined their life. Galileo. Take next month's rent also, from this good-for-nothing bloody Raaka. Pa! Pa! Pa! (Tamil)DO YOU EVEN KNOW WHO RAAKA IS? Gullu! Gullu! Gullu! Why did you hit me? I am not used to hitting him, and he's not used to getting slapped. And anyway, you were already getting slapped. I thought...I rather hit you only. Look, son. Don't join the army if you don't want to. And...what's it called? You don't have to ride dish antennas if you don't want to. Not dish antenna. Why should he sit on the dish antenna? Rockets. Space research, satellite. Same thing. But do something worthwhile. Papa... our decision is final. Yes, Appa. Just listen to us. Trust me, Appa. The consequences can be pretty bad. What's the worst you can do? Stop paying our pocket money. We'll earn. We didn't come here just to stop your pocket money. Internet also? Son, we've a record of every penny spent on you. Fine, we'll pay you back. How much can it be? One million. Two million. Five million. 50 million? You added GST also, father. You'll get that back. And in case you fail to return our money in three months, then you must promise to quit this ghost world forever. Just a moment. Gullu - Closed doors? - I don't know, dude. - I think... - Struggles of a witch? Struggles of a witch...won't do it. Then desires of a witch it is. Okay, fine. We'll repay your 50 million... with principal interest. With GST. Appa, we will catch ghosts and prove you wrong. We made a commitment, but ever imagined how we'll catch a ghost? How? You're a human being. I can see you. Caught you. We can see ghosts now. We'll catch them as well. No, Major. We've seen several horror films. It's not going to be so easy. We'll have to work hard.

Romeos are requested, if you're done cosying up, then get some popcorn for the lady. See you after a short break. Evil laughter. You were not supposed to read that Sorry. Master, he came here a couple of months ago, and made us kill his step-brother. But master, I don't understand, why he's back here again. I guess he's being haunted by a fierce soul. Are spirits troubling you? You know it all. Master, weird incidents are occurring in the palace. It's complete chaos. That's why I've brought double the money. Please solve this problem today. Please. Not today. After two days. Why two days? There's a lunar eclipse in two days. Spirits are the weakest on that day. Spirits expunged on that day, disappear forever. But brother-- Quiet. His spirit shall disappear forever on the day of the lunar eclipse. ...three...four... Full moon. Bro. ...five... The lunar eclipse is in two days. I've read that spirits are very weak on that day. Vulnerable. So? So I was thinking, I'll tell Ragini about my feelings. What's the point? Your love life itself is under an eclipse. Sour grapes. Guys, come on. We got to go. 101... What's the matter? We'll have to stop all of Phone Bhoot's operations for a couple of days. Why? Remember that favour you two owe me. The time has come for it. Hello...did you forget... your promise? You were supposed to help us make 50 million. We aren't even halfway there. I'll help you reach your target later. This is urgent. Strange. You don't honour your own words! As I had said, when it's time to call in my favour, I'll not take no for an answer. Fine, but you are supposed to call in your favour, after we've made money. Right, Gullu? Gullu, I thought we were friends. Yeah.. I thought at least you'll understand me. Let's hear her out. Fine, so what can be more important than money? Dushyant. Who is Dushyant? To know that you'll have to hear my story. Story! This is how we listen to stories. I mean watch. You don't worry. Start. Dushyant Singh. The Prince of Raunakpur. One day he fell off his horse. So I got a call. Why you? I was working as a physiotherapist, for the Royal Polo Club. You're a doctor? Have you ever played doctor-doctor? It's my favourite game. Will you shut up? He won't, but you continue. That's where we first met. "Without you..." "life feels incomplete." "This distance..." "is unbearable." "Without you..." "life feels incomplete." "This distance..." "is unbearable..." "I've spent sleepless nights" It was love at first sight. With the horse? Not the horse... Dushassan. Not Dushassan, It's Dushyant. Yeah-yeah whatever. Continue. An orphan who never got any love all her life, had actually found her prince charming. "Prepared to face every trial of love." "Give up my share of desires." "I am so crazy about you." "Ask for my heart, and I can give my life too." "Here's what you do," "hold my hands..." "Walk with me..." Enough of this 1942 a Love Story. If she can't live without the horse, why are you getting emotional? I was not talking about the horse... She's talking about Dhanush. Dushyant. Yeah-yeah whatever. Continue. We were madly in love. I still remember that night, when Dushyant proposed to me. That night, in the car... It was magical. "Is it all true?" "Or are you a dream?" "I am your words, you're the book." "My heart beats only for you." "You're the one I prayed for to the heavens." "If you ever leave me, know this... If you leave me..." "I will die." "I will die." "If you leave me..." "If you leave me..." "If you leave me..." "I will die." "I will die." And I died in that accident. Excuse me. Did the horse survive? Idiot. How can the horse fit in the vehicle? A horse-carriage is obviously driven by a horse. Where did the horse-carriage come from? All kings and princes travel in horse-carriages. I meant we were in a car. And Ragini died in that car accident, and Dhanraj survived. Dushyant! - Yeah, whatever. - Sorry. Continue. Dushyant started blaming himself for my death. He went into depression. He became a recluse. I tried to reach out and talk to him. But his family thought he was going crazy. Because he felt my presence everywhere. And then Dushyant and his entire family, donned some kind of talisman, so that no spirit could harm them. Question? How can we two help you out? Only you guys can help me. Because you two are the link between humans and spirits. Whenever Dushyant feels lonely, he visits the same accident spot. Today he left a letter at that spot. Hindi. "Beloved, Ragini." "Are you aware of that moment of impertinence in love?" "This is the moment," "that makes you fall in love with death," "and hate life." "With the ink of hatred it etches certain words in your beautiful life," "which gets you in touch with your inner self and creates chaos." "The moment of impertinence in love, Ragini." "Ink of hatred." Where do you get this ink, bro? - I want it. - It's called romance. What is the poet trying to imply here? If you had read ahead, you would've known that two days later, Dushyant is going to kill himself at the same accident spot. He's going to kill himself. Why didn't he just write that? Why is he being so old school? He's romantic at heart. Okay, tell me one thing. Why does Dayanand want to commit suicide two days later? It's Dushhh... Because... in two days, it will be one year to my death. Ohh... Happy death anniversary in advance. But explain to me... Isn't it good if he dies? What's the problem? You two can be together after he's dead. No... I want you to stop his suicide attempt, so he can happily lead my share of life as well. It is an awesome story you have came up with. But it won't work on us. What are you saying, Major? Gullu, my bro, you're an innocent soul. She's trying to mislead us with her stupid story. Mislead. Yeah, look... It started with polo, then came a fairy-tale-style romance. Suddenly a thriller-type death. Then she threw in two horror scenes. The same old cliched melodramatic emotions in the end. There is no consistency in her story. All that but not a single sex scene. And I've a question, that will expose this entire fraud story. What happened to the horse? Major, you treat everything like a joke. Think about her pain. I can see honesty in her eyes. There's death in her eyes. Her eyes are dead. No, it's a matter of life and death. I am going with her. You're going? Yes, I am. I am not coming. What? And, when she feeds you to some man-eating spirit, then don't call on Phone Bhoot for help. I will call... and I'll also pick up the call. The girl gives him some importance and he starts flying... It's humans like you that make me glad, that I died and became a ghost. Please meet her once. She's a new admission. Yes, master. We feel she will be a great asset to our company. Come on. Master... my name's Wicky Witch. I'm fed up with this life. I am tired of wandering all around. I cannot work freelance anymore. No more. I want to work in your company's corporate structure. I want salvation, master. Salvation? Yes, salvation. Bloody Bengali rasgulla... Salvation. Yes, salvation. You shall soon be given a chance to prove your loyalty. If you succeed, you shall be given salvation like the other thousands of souls. The heart wants more. Thank you. Boys. - Master - Master.. How was she, master? She has the fire to prove herself. Buddy, don't bring such wonky witches here, how many times have I told you? Is one of you having an affair with her? No, that's not it, master. No one wants to work with us anymore. Everyone's going to Phone Bhoot. - To hell with this bloody Phone Bhoot-- - Master. What if someone finds out that you cannot give salvation? What did you say? - No... - If you ever say that again, I'll put you in a bottle and... No. This bloody Phone Bhoot is ruining our business. Business has gone down 35% in the last three months. How did these amateurs become so smart? - All thanks to their app. - App, what? Mobile software. Make one for us too, dude. Whose funeral are you waiting for? Your permission. Consider it done, master. Software engineers are a dime a dozen in our country. We'll kill a software engineer right away, and make his spirit build the app. Great going, dude, great. First time these idiots have talked sense. Gullu. I need both of you. Don't worry, I've known Major since we were kids. You just follow my lead. Come. Bloody Gullu, hitting on my girl... "Your laugh's like the ringing of a telephone," "Your voice was composed in digital technology." "Madonna or Natasha." "Zakhir Hussain's drumbeat, what are you?" Even naughty girls need love. Isn't it? "In the night, no control." "What to do...tell me now." "Break my body." "Take my love." "Take my soul." No! "Come on." Thank you. What thank you? Was supposed to take a left 17 kilometres back. You brought me this far. Can't figure out what place this is. There are no petrol pumps here either. And you're saying thank you. Peace, bro. I am only here for Phone Bhoot. If you two siblings mess up, it'll ruin my name in the market. Why are you laughing? Driver, let's go. Let's play some music. "Your laugh's like the ringing of a telephone," What song is this? Change the song. - Birds. - Fly. - Parrots. - Fly. - Mynahs. - Fly. - Buffaloes. - Fly... Uncle, show me your hand. Okay. Come on. - Mosquito. - Flies. - Bird. - Flies. - Engineer. - Dies. I'll be late. I'll be late for my meeting with the investors. Dude, now you are... 'Late' forever. Who are you two? "In the night, no control." Leave it, bro. Turn off the music. Master. Master. Good evening. There's bad news. Every time you open your mouth, only shit comes out. Just say you have news, I know it's gonna be bad. Master. Phone Bhoot is heading in our direction. - I think we are gonna be-- - Attacked. Hmmm... Let them come. Let them come. No one can kill Aatmaram. I've been blessed with a boon. I can't be killed from the North or South. Neither humans nor spirits. Nor cold nor fire. There is no power, that can kill Aatmaram. Call Johnny. Who? Johnny Dushman? Master, you sent him on a world tour. To expand our overseas business. Master, don't fret over little things like this. Why don't we let that Wicky Witch- Take a shot at them. You two are head-over-heels in love with her... No. She's new around the block. She'll focus on the job. And Major-Gullu will be-- Screwed! Take this What? Ohh... You dumped your bro for a ghost. I can do anything for my love. Idiot, you're taking your love, to reunite with her love. By doing this, I will win her heart. What? You really think that will work? She loves Dushyant. Major, stop horsing around. Guys like you are not lovers, but best friend material. Ms. Widow, you? We looked all over for you that day. You disappeared. How are your feet now? Are they alright? You're all going to die. He won't spare you! You're all going to die. If you run like that, you're going to die first. Ms. Widow, there's oncoming traffic, you're looking this way... I think her feet are straight. It's her body that got twisted around in the accident. You mean... we had to twist her body, not feet. Ms. Widow, we have a physiotherapist as well. Yeah... Ragini! You're all going to die! Die...Die! What a trip! Stop, sister. How far are you going to run? You're in Lahore. "God knows... when I crossed Amritsar." - "and when I..." - What the...Lahore! "arrived in Lahore..." You see... Just my darn luck. I was doing pretty good as a freelancer. Then Major-Gullu came along and ruined everything. I tried to work in Aatmaram's corporate structure, and again Major-Gullu... Made me run for my life all the way to Lahore. I was 5'6 in height... Now I am only 5'4 because of all the running. I am a witch. I cannot even work from home. Major-Gullu are not all that bad. They are helping me in stopping Aatmaram. If you all pitch in, we can finish Aatmaram. This way we can help free several spirits. Flee... Free. Flee... - Free. - Flee. Free. Yes...Flee... Is your Hindi weak? Yes. It's okay? Master, we've some good news. What the... First time ever, you're not shitting from your mouth. What's the matter? Our app is ready, master. What's the app called? Same as the name of the company. Aatmaram Shastrashakti Souls Incorporated. Don't you think it should be something shorter? Always feel the pulse of the youth, dude. How? Take 'A' from Aatmaram. Bigger. Capital. Capital. Take 'S' from Shashtra. Capital. Let the 'Souls' be the way it is. That's our job. Correct. Now combine them together. Assouls? Assouls? Ah! Soul. How is it? It'll go viral all over the country. Not just in our country, but abroad as well. You guys know nothing about marketing. Now that's marketing. That reminds me... Where's that gal of yours, Wicky Witch? She's been a no-show recently. You spoke a lot about her. What happened? "New on the block?" "Will work hard?" Your romance is biting me in the a** Master, our spirits can handle priests and sorcerers. But they are not prepared for Phone Bhoot. - Master. - Yes. Could they possess some kind of weapon like you do? Quiet. No, no, that's not possible. Only you could possess a weapon like this. Isn't it? Yes... Aatmaram Shastrashakti. Right. Call Johnny. Who? Johnny Dushman? He just arrived in Dubai. The Black crow informed us just yesterday. Snake's having too much fun, block his credit card. He'll come crawling back. And another thing... Call Lady Daayana. Lady Daayana! I told you... I knew from Day 1 that Ragini was a fraud. She is definitely having an affair with some spirit. What did you get us into, Gullu? I got us in this? Who was planning to take her on a long drive in a tank? We've been waiting for two hours. I am leaving. I am not waiting for your Ragini. My Ragini? Actually, okay. What are you going to wait till Christmas now? Let's go. Why are you going in reverse? It's not me. What the...ponytail! Bro, I think it's definitely a Banshee. Say something. Ms.Banshee. If you wanted a lift, you could have just waved. Why so serious, Ms.Banshee? I think her ponytail's stuck in our bumper. Doesn't matter. We'll help her. Gullu, give me a hand. Gullu, what's going on? Ponytail fan. Turn off your helicopter, Ms.Banshee. Or you'll take off. Ms.Banshee. We'll give you our contact card. We want to die another day... Does she use 'Brahmi Maamla Hair Oil'? No, no, it's Neokarpin. For her strong, black hair... Her secret is Vasmol. Black? (Punjabi)I'll chop you to pieces. Beat you to a pulp. Once I'm done with you two, you'll never stand on your two feet again. Couldn't understand a thing. She's saying... I'll chop you to pieces. Beat you to a pulp. Once she's done with us, we'll never stand on our two feet again. That's unfair. Exactly. You two idiots think I am joking. Now watch how I beat you two like a drum. Drum. Gullu, formula no. 179. Track no. 179! Ms.Banshee... let go... Ms.Banshee, I am a Punjabi too. Give me some discount. Track no. 179... by DJ Gu. "I couldn't stop swaying," "to your crazy beats." "Dodging the boys of your neighbourhood." "I couldn't stop swaying," "to your crazy beats." "Dodging the boys of your neighbourhood." "Pitch black eyes..." "Eyes up to mischief." "Aims straight for my heart your Afghani looks." "Pitch black eyes..." "Eyes up to mischief." "Aims straight for my heart your Afghani looks." "My heart's floored," "by your killer gait." "Can't tell you how amazing she looks when she's angry!" "Red Ribbons on black ponytails." "Red Ribbons on black ponytails." "Red Ribbons on black ponytails." "O gorgeous one..." "O gorgeous one..." "O gorgeous one hold on to your Ribbons." "Ponytail..." "Ponytail..." "Ponytail..." "Red Ribbons on black ponytails." "Sing with us." Come on. "I am a divine beauty." "Even the moon's after me." "Stars are crazy about me." "Because I am such a cutie." "Your looks are fake," "my charm is original." "Boys have clicked pictures of me," "and hung them on their wall." "Like a poetry of Ghalib," "you're every poet's imagination." "Even angels are jealous of you." "Even angels are jealous of you." "Red Ribbons on black ponytails." "Red Ribbons on black ponytails." "Red Ribbons on black ponytails." "O gorgeous one..." "O gorgeous one..." "O gorgeous one hold on to your Ribbons." "Ponytail..." "Ponytail..." "Red Ribbons on black ponytails." "I couldn't stop swaying," "to your crazy beats." "Dodging the boys of your neighbourhood." "I couldn't stop swaying," "to your crazy beats." "Dodging the guys of your neighbourhood." A Banshee's power lies in her ponytail. Hey... It's a small heart, with small desires. Little things happen in big countries. Aatmaram will not spare you two. It wasn't wise of you two to challenge Aatmaram. Hey... Where did she go? And who is Aatmaram? Whoever he is. Why does he want to kill us? Sorry, guys. This is all my fault. You were supposed to kill those two, not party with them. I am a Punjabi, master. I couldn't control myself. It was an amazing song. "Red Ribbons on black ponytails." With powers, you've lost your brains too. Master, there's a ghost helping them. A spirit helping human beings, master? Her name is Ragini. Ragini? Master. Could this Ragini be the fiance of the prince of Raunakpur? So, in that accident Dushyant also died along with you? So, who are we trying to save? Dushyant of course. But Dushyant is dead. Our death was not an accident. And then they paid Aatmaram to imprison his soul. We couldn't be together while we were alive, nor after we were dead. Forgive me, master. I disappointed you... Enough, child. You've pleased me today. You shall definitely get salvation. Go on, child. You mean you turned us against Aatmaram, to get your job done? Was that your plan? Of course. It's an exchange offer. Offer us to Aatmaram, in exchange for your lover's freedom. No. We can save thousands of other spirits along with Dushyant. Because if there's anyone who can break Aatmaram's boon, It's the two of you. No, please spare us. Gullu, let's not fall for her tricks again. These girls don't stop making a joke out of us, even after they are dead. Come, Gullu. You used us to get your revenge. You broke my trust, Ragini. You broke my trust... and lust. So, it was Ragini's plan all along. But as soon as the lunar eclipse begins, the power of all the spirits will be mine. Then my time will come. The dark age. I know I made a mistake. I just hope I get a chance to rectify my mistake. [Chanting] I am so-- What did you think? You can free your love? Finish off Aatmaram Shastrashakti? Now watch what I do to your Major and Gullu. Major and Gullu are gonna come. They shall rise up from the ground. And they will tear them apart and devour them. You cannot lay a finger on them. Why? Because Major and Gullu... are not coming. Not coming? How could that be? Because they have no interest. Not interested? - That's cheating. - Yeah. Why did we gather this army? Bad luck. Those two will have to come here. Since they are destined to die here. Phone Bhoot will not live to see another day. She didn't even wait for me to turn around, bro. Oh really, who would wait for a brother like you. Mind your tongue. Don't abuse me. You deserve it. You don't deserve even this. Since the day you came into my life, my life's graph has taken a nose dive. Bloody thankless creep. I literally took care of you, and you screwed me! Major, cliff. Hey... Aslam. You here? I am no longer Aslam. I am the 'Good Lantern'. Meaning. This is an accident-prone area. And people are always drunk driving. What I do is... I possess the driver before the turn, and help him cross. I learnt it from you two. Being useful. Helping people. Sir, where is Ragini ma'am? Ragini ma'am isn't with us. Why? How does it matter? It does matter, sir. You guys are successful because you're a team. Anyone can earn money, but Ragini ma'am earned you respect. Time to go, sir. I think there's a truck approaching. 'Good Lantern.' Gullu. Aslam does have a point. Truly en-lanterned. How will we find Aatmaran? He isn't even on Google Maps. Well...let's use our radar. Hey... Looking for Ragini? - Follow... - Us. - Come... - On. Climax!
