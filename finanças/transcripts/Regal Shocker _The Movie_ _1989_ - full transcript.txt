Lara, your mom's home. Just give me a moment, Auntie. Lara! Lara! You and your lawyer, are you playing jokes on me? Everything is prepared. Here, I'll give it to you. Go on with our separation, but I'll take all my properties. It's just a payment, Teddy. A payment for all the wasted time that I gave you being your wife. As well as my suffering, just to make our family complete. So you have courage to say those things to me? Between us, who took off? Gone somewhere, left our children. Then, you're telling me that I'm irresponsible. And you? You're just here in my house, when you're tired womanizing. When did you have time for me? When did you have time with your children? Okay! You want to take this to court. Fine. Lets' see who's stronger. Don't challenge with me, Teddy! All the love that was in my heart, became anger. Enough to destroy you. Babe! - Hi Mommy! - How's my baby? Were you good? - Miss you! - I miss you also. Anton. You have to get a shave. Wait, I'll give you something. Mommy, my birthday isn't coming yet. Is it necessary to have an occasion to give you a gift? You know what Mommy, this is so beautiful. Of course. That's for my baby. Mommy, are you leaving again? Most probably. Mommy, don't you love Daddy anymore? You will not understand it even though I'll explain it to you. Don't worry. If I'll leave, I'll bring you with me Lara. How about Anton? I still don't know. What about Daddy? Your Daddy will stay here. Oh, what did my beloved son do again? Mommy, it's not Anton's fault. He didn't start the fight. When did he claim his fault? Oh, Belen. Did he pass in school? I think so, Madame. He's better off with his father! We should let them be together. We'll leave them to kill each other. Dude, can you pass me my beer. Can you still drive, dude? Dude, I'm celebrating. My mom got home. You've been telling us that your family's a mess, but now you have a happy ending? What do you mean happy ending? My mom's been in our house for almost fifteen minutes, and she just wants to fight with my father. I don't know what my parent's problem is. I don't care if they separate, it's taking them been too long! Is it okay with you? Just don't they ever bother me. Why are you late? Your directions isn't clear, I was lost. Jimbo. Anton... and Toffee. Dude! He's my cousin that I was talking about, who's so weird. Ha! Ha! Ha! Dude. Wow, dude! You motorcycle is beautiful. Anton is still sleeping. We have somewhere to go. I'm Denis' cousin, a friend of Anton. Can you wake Anton up? Just tell him that Jimbo is here. Okay, wait. - He'll just go down. - Thank you. Hi. Why are you hiding your drawing? Do you live here? Are you related to Anton? Sister. Oh... For a while, I thought I was talking to mute person. See, you look prettier when you smile. My name is Jimbo. You have name, right? Lara. Lara. That's a pretty name, Lara. What are you doing here? You have school? I don't go to school. What about you? School doesn't like me. Oh, just like Anton? Just like your brother. Lara! Lara. Get inside. Good morning. Auntie, he is Anton's friend. Get dressed up. We'll go to church. Church, it's not even a Sunday. Why? Is it just every Sunday you're talking with Papa Jesus? Lara, don't be stubborn, just get in. Dude, you can't get with her. She's our friend's sister. Dude, I know. I'm not kidding. Yes, she's beautiful. But Dude, she's child like. She has a psychological problem. Her family is weird. That's why Lara did not go to school. Flipper! - I pity her. - Why should you? She is happy because she can't see her surroundings. Show empathy to Anton. Anton? Why are you asking too many questions about Jimbo? I can sense something else here. Nothing, he just looks nice. Of all your friends, I think he is the nicest. That's crazier than you. Yes he moves cautiously. Hmmm. Will he come back here? Maybe. - But when? - I don't know. Anton! Your mom's calling you. Tell her I'm busy. Anton! Alright. Alright, don't make a speech. Oh Auntie! Get Lara to sleep. It's already late. It's better to be clear to you on what's happening between me and your dad. You're old enough to know. You're old enough to make your own decisions. You'll take Lara. It's up to you where you want to go. Anton! You can't be like that all your life. Look at the way you dress. You're already 22 years old, but you're still in high school. While some of your batch mates are now working, - look at you? - I thought you and dad have the problem. Why are you putting the spotlight on me? Because we're so over preaching to you. And it's not going to be forever that we will be the one to clean up your mess. Mommy, I'm not a house, not a land, not a car, nor money that you and Dad can split. Just because you don't like each other anymore. I don't care about your problems. So please, don't you give a damn about my life! Do not answer me like that! I'm just following the things you taught me. I'm just telling the truth. Anton? Won't you come with Mom and me? Why would I push myself on her? You're the only one she wants to bring. Anyway, it's fine. It's better for you to stay with her in America. I don't like it Anton. If you will not go with us, I won't come. Lara, someday there will come a time that we will be apart. It's not for forever that you're always with me. You know what Lara, you should learn how to take care of yourself. I don't want us to be apart. Don't go down, I'll be the one to buy some. What do you want? - French fries. - Why did I even ask. Okay, stay here. Hey! Did I scare you? What are you doing there? Anton is buying me some french fries. You're too spoiled. You're even asking your brother to buy. He is also asking something from me once in awhile. Why don't you go down? I'll treat you and Anton to a cheeseburger. Anton told me I'm not allowed to go outside the car. He will not get mad. I'll take care of him! Lara? I forgot. What do you want to drink? Anton? Oh! It's you again? You're everywhere. Anton? Jimbo is inviting us to eat. He'll treat us. Why Jimbo? Is it your birthday? No. It's not so... Invite us again when it's your birthday. Alright? Go ahead. Bye, Lara. Oh, what do you want to drink? Orange juice. Lara, do you want to join me? My Auntie left me for a while, she told me she'll be gone for a little while. But it's been too long and I am so hungry. Come. I'll drop you off at your house. Why? I know where you live. Hmm.. I'll ride that? You don't like it? Let's drive around. Alright. Here. Hold on. We'll fly. Why aren't you eating? I'm okay. I'll just watch you. Are you always inside your house? My mom and dad don't want me going out. They want me to be with Auntie Belen at all times. Don't you have friends? Before. Where are they now? I don't know. I don't see them anymore. I think they forgot about me. Don't worry I'm here. Are we friends now? Will I treat you to a hamburger if we're not friends? Do you want us to be friends? This looks nice. My mom gave it to me. Why did you do that? We are friends right? Why don't we call the police? Could you please stop nagging. Let's just look for her first! Look for her? The driver drove around the church plenty of times, but still can't find Lara. Can we find her if you continue nagging? I'll put you in jail instead! Belen. If something happens to my daughter you will pay for this. I told her to stay in the church, because I just need to buy something at the grocery. Why did you leave her? Stupid! Oh what is happening here? Your sister is missing, because of this stupid woman! Oh my God! Hi Mommy! I'm flying! Lara. Get down from that machine right now! Right now! Come on! Get inside the house young lady. - Mommy, why? - Now! It's just that, I suddenly saw Lara. Alright young man. But please, I don't want you to see my daughter again. I'm sorry dude. Okay go, the situation might worsen. And who told you that you can come with that man Lara? Mommy! We did not do anything wrong. We just ate french fries. I don't care! He's still a man! What if something happened to you? Belen! Yes? Be thankful nothing happened to this child. If not, I will send you to jail! - Mommy! Auntie has nothing to do with this. - Don't answer me back! - You have no rights to answer back! - Leave her alone! Oh yes! Yes! You're a great mother. Don't be rude to your mother! Who's the one who taught me to be rude? It's the both of you, right? - No! - Anton! - Anton! - Stop it! Let's go Anton! Let's go! Why did you call? I wanted to find out if you're alright. Okay, okay. Okay bye bye now. Lara, I have to see you. No, you can't. I won't put down this phone unless you agree to see me. Uhm. Okay fine. Tomorrow? I'll see you in church. What time? Lara? Around 4:00pm, okay bye. Lara, who's your talking with? No one Dad. Will you be okay here? Yes, just come back for me. But don't go anywhere okay? They will blame me again. I'll be back. I will just have the car fixed. - Okay, just go. - Just pray here, huh. Okay. I thought you were angry with me. No. Why should I be mad at you? You're still pretty. Why? I don't know what am I feeling right now. What do you mean? Why is it like that? I'm so happy when I'm with you. If you're not around, it seems I want to see you again. Do you feel the same way? Yeah. Maybe because we're friends. I guess so. Jimbo. You promise me one thing. What is it? Whatever happens, we're still friends. Our feelings won't fade away. I promise. Also... Don't leave me, please. Like what my friends did. I won't Lara. Thank You! Why Jimbo? Dude, I'm sorry. I'm just fond of your sister. Fond of her? What is she? A dog? I just want to talk to her again. I don't think that's possible. Dude, please help me. You know what Jimbo, if you're a jerk, I am more badass than you. If you hurt my sister, whoever you are, wherever you are, I will kill you. Tomorrow night. At the park. In the church where Lara goes. Around nine! Thank you dude! Lara... Lara get dressed, mom's leaving. Lara! Do you want to see Jimbo or not? Really? Get dressed. Thank you Anton. - Thank you! - Alright, alright, get dressed. Why are you crying? Why do you have to leave? Don't be such a baby. I'll just leave for a while. Two weeks, just two weeks. That's what my friends always say to me. But they don't come back anymore. Jimbo please? Don't go, you're the only friend I have left. Please? Lara, I need to go back to Davao. My mom's sick. My dad asked me to come. When she feels much better, I'll be back in two weeks. Promise. Promise? Promise. What's this? To remind you that you promised me you'll come back. Lara, let's go. They might be at home already and catch us. Anton please? Give me a few minutes, please? Do you want us to get in trouble? Come on, say goodbye to him. Come on. Promise me! Two weeks. - What's happening? - Fasten your seatbelt, please fasten your seatbelt. Please fasten your seatbelts. That's the only thing I can give you. If you want to leave me, go ahead and do it! But I cannot provide all your luxury in life. You want to be alone? Then provide for yourself. You won't scare me now Teddy. And you can't fool me anymore, because I know my rights. Monica, I know how to respect an agreement. Did I ever have anything hidden behind your back? Why Teddy, our marriage isn't that a contract? What is it? Ma'am someone's looking for Anton outside. He said, he's Toffee. - Okay, let him in. And call Anton in his room. - Okay. Alright. Can you talk to your son. Decent people don't go to other people's houses at this time. Maybe you have forgotten, he's also your son! Good evening Ma'am. Toffee, don't you think it's a little bit too late to be going out? Don't you have school tomorrow? It's because... Dude, what's the problem? Dude, we should go Dennis. It's Jimbo. What happened to Jimbo? Didn't you see it on the news? The plane he was in going to Davao crashed! Dennis called. It's confirmed that Jimbo was on that flight. He was crying on the phone. Wait for me, I'll just get dressed. You're lying! You're lying! But baby, it's true! You're just saying that because you're mad at him! You're lying! Because you don't want me to see him! - It's true! It's true! - No! I don't want to hear it! Auntie! Auntie! Auntie! That's enough. - Baby, it's okay. - No! I don't want you here! Just go! Anton! Anton... Leave us alone! We don't need you! Ma'am... Sir... She has not eaten for three days. She doesn't want to get up from her bed. She's severely weak, Ma'am. Teddy what do you think we should do? It will pass. That's what you told me two days ago. It will pass. It will pass, but she isn't recovering? Don't you see what she's doing to herself! Why are you always blaming me? Am I the pilot of Jimbo's plane? Bring her to the hospital. She needs to be cured! I don't think she needs medicine. No medicine will not help her recover from her pain. It seems she doesn't want to live anymore. It seems she doesn't want to live anymore. She doesn't want to live anymore. She doesn't want to live anymore. Lara... Lara... It's up to you. If you don't look at Mommy's gift. I will just return it to the store. Lara, I have an idea. Let's go out! We will tag along Daddy, Auntie and also Anton. We will watch a movie. Your choice! Just like before, and then we will have ice cream after. And... I will just leave the giraffe here. Give... Give it a name, okay? And maybe, we'll just see each other later. Okay? You just don't really know your own daughter. I thought you quit smoking? It's my first, Teddy. I can't help it. Teddy, What's happening to our lives. Sometimes I think about it, I know I didn't do anything wrong. I've done everything I can, to become a good wife, a good mother. This is all I know. This is how my parents raised me. But why is it, it seems nothing right has happened to us? You're gone, now even my kids. Monica... I know I have made so many mistakes with you guys. I have so many mistakes. But please never think that, I wanted you out of our lives. Teddy, I have something that I've been meaning to ask you. Do you still love me? Of all the women that I've been with, to whom am I coming home? It's still with you. What are you doing to yourself? Why won't you eat? Look at yourself. Lara, Jimbo's dead. He's not coming back. Please don't leave me. We are the only ones who understand each other. Jimbo? Jimbo? Jimbo... Jimbo? Jimbo? Jimbo! Jimbo! Jimbo... Jimbo! Lord, why? Lord, what did I do wrong? Why are you mad at me? Why are you always taking away all the people I love! Lord! Lord, I'm following all your will right? Lord, why are you like that? Lord please! Take me Lord! Please! Lord please! Take me. Please... Lord! Lara... Jimbo... Jimbo! - Jimbo, it's because they said... - Whatever they told you, it won't happen. I am here now, just what I promised you that I'll be coming back. - Jimbo, why are you so cold? - It doesn't matter Lara. I can't stay long. I have to go soon. But why? What's important is that I kept my promise. Here. Why are you returning this to me? I gave this to you. Just to let you know, that I will be waiting for you. Now it's my turn to wait for you. It won't take long, we'll be together again. I have to go now. I will wait for you. Jimbo... Jimbo! I will wait for you. Anton! Anton! Hurry up! Hurry! Anton, something happened here. But why? Anton, your sister! She not in the house. Do they know it yet? I don't know, what should we do? Come with me, I know where she is. Lara! Lara! Auntie! Auntie! Anton, she has a very high fever! He came back. Jimbo... Jimbo... Lara, Jimbo's dead. He's not coming back anymore. Until now, the bodies of the other victims are still missing when their plane crashed. No, he came back. He kept his promise. What's this? Anton, why? How did that happen? What do you mean? Auntie, Lara gave that to Jimbo the last time they saw each other. That was with Jimbo when he left. He came back... He came back... He kept his promise. My God! I have a pimple! Will you hurry up? They're already waiting for us downstairs. I'm not going out because I have a pimple okay? Baby girl, your date is waiting for you! I just nagged Jaime to bring his cousin. He can't see me like this! I'm not pretty tonight, okay? Baby girl this Ernest. He is Jaime's cousin. Dude, where's the corsage? Oh, yes! Yes... Yes... May I? Ouch! Give it to me! Boss, are you sure that Japanese millionaire's car will pass through here? Yes! This is the only route that he can pass by going to the embassy party. Where is it? Where is it? I want to kill someone! We're not killing anyone! We will kidnap the Japanese, once you kill him, how will we get a ransom? There he is! There he is! Get ready! Is he the one? Is he the one I will kill? He's a millionaire, do you think he will ride in a Volkswagen? Then, who are they? Sorbetes, are you sure you know how to get out of here? I think I already saw this house a while ago, Sorpresa. The guard already gave us the instructions. I know, but the houses here all look the same, Sorpresa. As you can see, all I see are walls. Alright then, just hurry up. Baby girl, sorry about the pin. Where is he? He should be on the way to the party! That's right! Boss, there he is! Take cover! Boss! Boss! I can't see anything. I can't see anything! Dumb-ass!

P-B-A-6-6-9 - That's it! - That's it! Start the car! Go after them! Hurry! It won't start. What the hell is happening? - Let's just push the car! - Let's go! Faster! Faster! Let's push it. Let's do it. Push! Hurry! The visitors are here. Turn on the lights! Smile! Mrs. Cabano, Aunt Marilou! Come, come! Hello! Okay, smile. Look at the camera, your angle. Okay, very good.

Your guests are all gaping around. General, have you met Cindy and Baby girl? Of course! Vanessa baby, why don't you entertain your guests? Are you sure she's coming? Yes, she's just shooting a movie but after that Kris will come. It's important that Kris is here, so that my house arrest will be lifted. So I can show my loyalty.

Hey, it's TJ. It's TJ! Hi Baby girl! Baby girl, you've met Abigail right? Yes I know her. Who wouldn't know her. Anyway, who's your date? Baby girl, there's a vacant seat. Maybe you want to sit. Dude, where did you get your barong? In Nayong Pilipino? Do you want one? Baby girl! Boss, I think they're already inside. Until what time is this? I need to go home and watch basketball. I think it's best if we break in already. Yeah! Murder time! Hey, no one shoots okay? No one shoots! We will just intimidate the crowd. We will take Mr. Nakayapak. Get ready for our disguise. Vanessa baby, why is your party like a wake? No one wants to dance. When Kris arrives, I'm sure she will be bored at your party! - Come on! - What am I going to do? - Aunt Marilou, Uncle General your event is so boring! - I know. I don't have anything to shoot. So what am I going to do? Let me take care of it! Music! Baby girl! Where are you going? Baby girl, would you please get out of that room? No! Baby girl you're so childish!

It's Mr. Nakayapak, the Japanese. We have not seen any Japanese here, we're all loyalist here. Isn't this the embassy party for Mr. Nakayapak? It's my birthday party!

We are nothing for you guys. You already escaped, so let us go. Hey! Wait a minute Sir, what are we going to do with these four? One of them told us they're rich, isn't it? That's why, we will ask for ransom. Baby girl, look what you did! Because of your arrogance this happened to us! It's true! We're rich! Why should we be ashamed of that? Look at them, they're poor! Wait, if you get the ransom will you release us? Shut up! Are you dumb? You've already seen us. Saw our faces. Oh no! We didn't see any face. Well that's true! Do you think we will forget your ugly faces! Baby girl I will hit you! You try! You just try TJ! Boss, once we get the money what will we do next? You don't use your brain! Simple...

I think we should have turned left in there. I was just following your instructions Sorpresa. That's why I turned right there. Excuse us! Yes? Oh! Sisters! Oh! A faggot! And so? Do you know how to go back to the convent? Ouch! Sisters, help us. Burglars are running after us! Look at those pretty dresses! - Thank you! Thank you! - There behind us! Please!

Hurry! Hey you! Get down. Don't move! If you don't want to die. Let's run! Will you shut up and don't move! Loro! Bring them to our car. - I don't want to! - Hey, get in! Boss, she slapped me! Damn this kid, don't you really want to get in? What am I? Stupid? You'll get me in, but then you'll still kill me? Alright then, you will all die! Loro! Shoot them. No! - I said, shoot them. - I said no! I also don't have any bullets anymore. You don't have any bullets anymore huh? Don, don, ta da! Countrymen! Attack! Oh, here you go. Get it all in! You're too slow. How will we finish this? Oh! Be careful! Here's another one. Be careful! That's expensive you might scratch it. Come on, okay. Get it all in. Madame excuse me, what we're carrying is a little heavy. Ma! The movers want to pass through. Ma! Huh? Alright, straight up! Be careful, you might want to scratch it. Simang! Simang! Can you turn down the television? Huh? I said, turn down the TV! So why are you shouting? Ma, what is it again? Stuffed eggplant, favorite dish of your father. I miss him again Beth. Ma, we've already talked about this. You and my dad are better off separated rather than fighting every day. How will I forget 17 years Elizabeth? Everything I see, it reminds me of your dad. Even though he left me with that slutty stewardess. That's why Ma, so why are you still crying for him? Do you think my dad's crying over you while he's with that Stella? Is it because that Stella is as young as 25? He traded me in? She will also grow old you know! What do you think she's better than me? She's just a helper in an airplane. That is why, can we just eat? I'm so tired from us moving! Ma, are you bringing those groceries to the supermarket? No, to the other house. But why? We're not living there anymore? Your dad's still there. Ma, Stella is the one living there. Not us. Simang, is the canned tuna here? Yes. Don't you think it's dad that should be sending us groceries and not the other way around? We're not sure if that slutty stewardess is taking good care of your dad. It's better to be safe, people might say something bad. Alright, I have to go. Kiss. Okay, you and Simang take care of the house. Okay, okay get inside. I have so many things to do in the kitchen. Okay! It's because you're watching TV again right? Hey! In all the things that I have to do in the house, maybe I deserve to unwind a little bit. If I only knew this would happen, I should have been in Singapore instead. I should have been earning dollars. Who is that? Why? Don't you like my hair? Ma! What did you do to your hair? What's happening to you Madame? Ma what's wrong? I'm alright, I'm alright! I can't breathe with what I am wearing. I can't breathe. Ma, how can you not feel dizzy, all you ate was boiled eggs and tomatoes! I'm on a diet! I need to be beautiful just like the helper of the airplane that took over our house. You might get hospitalized with what are you doing! Mind your own business. This is scientific. I read in reader's digest. Okay, I have to go. You take care. You know what, one more week and your mom's going to snap! Oh my... Wait up! Wait! Why are you looking at our house? Sorry about that. We use to live there. I'm just curious who's living in there now. Hi! Leslie Fernandez. Beth Sta. Maria. I know... Elizabeth, eat your lunch! I don't want to miss my favorite show. I'll just finish this. Hey! Enough of that! You've been staring at that Nintendo for a while and you might get blind! Shut it down! Here comes the dictator! Simang... Beth? Didn't I shut down the Nintendo? Why is it... The prediction was great today, all the cards were all red! She said your dad and I will get back together. It's because that stewardess is only casting a spell on him! And she has a antidote. That's why soon the effect of her spell will disappear. Ma, you're not listening to me. What you're talking about is nonsense. Come on Ma, - What's important is what's happening to my life. In our life! As per the fortune teller, your dad and I will get back together. Don't you want that? Ma! I think we should talk some other time. That's what you get in watching horror movies! You have a wild imagination! Where can you find a ghost playing Nintendo? What is that? A child? That hurts! Stop it! Sorry! Brother... Brother! She just left? And didn't even leave a message for me? She just left a letter for you, it's because she got a phone call, then she took her luggage like a hurricane. Then she got in her car, and left the letter. Where did your mother go? In Hongkong. She's with my dad. Huh? She said they reconciled, and are having their second honeymoon. Huh? How about the stewardess? Are you alright? I'm alright. I was just in the area... Come in. Is that okay? Come on, get in and have something to drink. So that you'll have a different view of the house. Not like, you're always staring at our gate. Are you sure it's okay with you? Yes! Come in. So what do you like? Coke? Juice? - Anything. - Huh? We don't have that. Juice, maybe. Juice okay. Simang! Can we have some juice please. Simang! Simang! Give me a second. Our helper's a little bit crazy. But, sit down. Sit down. Simang! Leslie? What are you doing here? Almost nothing has changed in the room, since the time we were in this house. Did this used to be your room? No, it was my sister's. Oh... What's her name? It's Jenny. You could trust me. Have you ever talk to someone about what you experience in the house? Simang, but she's crazier than me. I've talked to my mom also. But she has bigger problem than a closet that won't close. There... My sister died in that room. It's Jenny... In that closet. They say I'm the eldest, and a man. I should be the one who's more patient. I should be the one to understand. But when you're twelve years old, it's not only hard to understand... You cannot understand. When Jenny makes mistakes, you're the one who broke this, right? Answer me! You're the one who broke this! Shut up! It's fine with them. But when I was the one who made a mistake, wow! For sure, I'll get some lecture from mom and dad. When Jenny hurts me, it's fine. But when my sister teases me, and when I retaliate, I will be the scolded. For them, it is my fault. Come with me! Brother! Brother! - Get off of me! Brother! - Come with me! Brother! Get off of me! Brother! Brother! Brother, have pity on me, please! Auntie! Brother! Brother! They thought it was an accident. They thought it was a freak accident, that Jenny was locked inside the closet. I was the only one who knew how my sister died. For ten years, I carried it in my mind. Ten years! I don't know what's with me... That I did this to my sister. Amen. Eternal rest, grant unto the soul of your daughter Jenny. For Christ our Lord. Amen. And may the perpetual light shine upon her. - Come with me, come with me. - No! - Come with me. - No! Simang! No! - Come with me, come with me. - No! Come with me, come! Come, I beg you come with me! I beg you come with me! - I beg you come with me, I don't want me it here. - Simang! Simang! Simang! Simang! Beth? Beth? Beth! Beth? Simang! Simang! Beth? Help me! Beth? Help me! Leslie! Leslie! Push it! Go! Push it! Help me, open this! I don't want it here! Push it! Push it! Leslie! Leslie, help me! Open this up! Leslie! Push it! - You will be with me forever. - Leslie! Get me out of here! - Leslie! - Brother, get me out of here. - I beg you, please open this up! - Hold on Beth. - Brother I want out of here. I beg you! Please! - Wait. Brother please! I don't want it here! Open this up! I don't want it here! I don't want it here! Brother! Brother! - Jenny? - Brother, I don't want it here! I beg you to open the door! Leslie! I beg you! Brother, why? Brother, why? Jenny... I'm sorry Jenny. Jenny... Forgive me please. I'm sorry. Jenny... Leslie! Leslie open the door. Leslie! Beth! Beth! Beth! Damn you! What did you do with Beth? What did you do with Beth? Beth! - Where's Beth? - Beth! Beth! Beth! Beth! What happened to you Beth! Oh my! Beth! Hey! Beth! Beth! What happened to Beth? Beth! Beth! Wake up Beth! Beth! Beth! Beth! You like? Nothing at all. Nothing is happening in the closet and in the room. Maybe because Jenny's soul really found peace. And you've already asked for forgiveness. Sorry you were involved with the mess. Leslie, don't blame yourself. What happened really had to happen. It's just the way it is! It's just a coincidence that it was me. Ma? What are you doing here? I thought you're coming back this Saturday? Ma, I'd like you to might my friend Leslie. He used to live here. Good evening. Ma, what happened? Is everything alright? What do you mean alright? Your father, that monster! He sent me a ticket to Hongkong. Even gave me a free hotel accommodation, so that he could just ask for a divorce! He will marry the helper of the airplane! Madame, why? What happened? What's that? Don't ever try cooking stuffed eggplant, if you don't want to lose your job! Starting today, stuffed eggplant is banned from this house. Is someone upstairs?
