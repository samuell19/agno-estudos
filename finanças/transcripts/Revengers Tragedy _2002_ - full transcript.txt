MOBILE PHONE RINGS Oi, mister. Are you a cockney? I'm taIking to you. Are you a cockney? Are you a cockney? (IMITATES COCKNEY ACCENT) We got ourseIves a cockney. He ain't fuckin' taIking! What's the matter? A fucking London boy. What the fuck's wrong with him? Welcome, stranger, to our city! Why not stop off for a relaxing drink or a dance at Duke's? Got any spare change, pIease, mate? Thou saIIow remnant of my poisoned Iove. My study's ornament. Thou sheII of death. Once the bright face of my betrothed Iady. When Iife and beauty naturaIIy fiII'd out these ragged imperfections. Then 'twas a face so far beyond the artificiaI shine of any woman's bought compIexion. She, when she was dressed in fIesh, the oId Duke poison'd, because she wouId not consent unto his Iust. No! It's true. OId bones don't Iie. They do when they're in the grave. When they're at peace they do but these oId bones wiII have no peace untiI they have... revenge! Revenge! Revenge! Revenge! Revenge! Men, come. CarIo, do you know a feIIow? - What feIIow? - Any feIIow. I know thee. Any feIIow so he be, a strange, disgested feIIow, of iII-contented nature, as it might be, disgraced in former times - a pimp? A pimp? I need a man who can heIp me in the business of my heart. Boy! Boy! A pimp! AII right, boy? 'Tis but a gIamour. 'Tis fake. It's rubbish. It's ridicuIous. CROWD CHANTING - What's that? - Lord Antonio. 'Tonio! 'Tonio! 'Tonio! And his Iady. That one is mine. That virtuous Iady? FooI. Everyone loves sport, especially in times of difficulty. - I'II have 20 on that. - We rally round our sporting heroes! 'Tonio! 'Tonio! 'Tonio! 'Tonio! 'Tonio! - Those cheers? - Lord Antonio. The game? The teams yet stand upon the Duke's arrivaI. The Duke's Boy and Antonio's Lad locked in anticipation of mortal combat! Everyone loves sport, no matter how it's played! The Duke! That he shouId do such wicked deeds and yet be Duke. Go, sister. Hide your pretty face. Beware an oId man, hot and vicious. 'Age, as in goId, in Iust is covetous.' CROWD BOOING Open 'em up! Move it! Get back! Keep them back! Get back! It's the Duke and Duchess! Keep back the rabbIe! Keep them back! Use your tasers! Go royaI Iecher! Go, grey hair'd aduItery! And thou his Duchess. Oh, that God wouId stuff infernaI fire into your brittIe bones! Do I know you, friend? Do you know me... more than friend? Brother? - AII right, mate? - Ah, you fuckin' cunt. Tension mounts! And they're off! The Lad shoots, the Boy saves! The Lad shoots again! Goal! lt's a thrilling scene. Brother, you must needs find me a pIace at court. I must be near the Duke. This is strange. This very e'en, the Duke's first born and heir, Lussurioso, asked me find out for him a strange composed and iII-digested feIIow. This e'en you say? Why, brother, this is fate. It is. But whose? His fate or yours? I set my fate at naught, so that I have revenge. Goal! A stunning victory for the Lord Antonio and his lovely wife! Your boy disgraces us. He is a good boy. He has two Ieft wrists. Ow! And just look at the smile on the Lad's face! lt says it all! Goal! - Leave me be, sirrah. - I have no Iike to. SCREAM Men, stand by my person! Maybe some assassin threatens the Duke, my Father's head, then the Dukedom wiII want a head. - Which must be mine! - Mine! Mine! For God's sake, somebody heIp me! HeIp! HeIIo, what's this? A sweet for when I've eaten up my meat? Come here. Go, now! Here's danger! - This Iady has need of me - This is the Duke's son! Another bIow then, for his Father's sake. Our pIan's dependent on his famiIy's trust. - He did assauIt my brother? - He is newIy come to the port- I wouId have kiIIed him too. I was prevented. I Iike him. Thou hast fucked us royaIIy, brother. Go and get Daddy! It's not fair! What hast been? Of what profession? - A bone-setter. - A bone-setter? A bawd, my sweet musk cat. One that sets bones together. Wondrous knave! FamiIiar as an ague! I can forget myseIf in private, but eIsewhere, I pray do you remember me. I am not Duke yet, but wiII be by and by. Thou hast been an agent to much knavery then? I've witnessed the surrender of 1000 virgins. I've seen patrimonies wash'd a' pieces! Then thou know'st i' th' worId strange Iust. Oh, fuIsome Iust! Drunken procreation, which begets so many drunkards! Some fathers dread not, gone to bed in wine, to sIide from the mother and cIing to the daughter-in-Iaw. Some uncIes are aduIterous with their nieces, brothers with brothers' wives. Oh, hour of incest! Any kin now next to the rim a' th' sister is man's meat in these days. In the morning, when they are up and dress'd and their mask is on, who can perceive this save that eternaI eye that sees through fIesh and aII? It is our bIood to err, tho' heII gap'd Ioud: Ladies know Lucifer feII, yet stiII are proud. Now, sir, I am beyond my depth in Iust and I must swim or drown. AII my desires are IeveI'd toward a virgin not far from HamiIton Square, to whom I have convey'd by messenger many wax'd Iines fuII of my neatest spirit and jeweIs that were abIe to ravish her without the heIp of man. AII this and more, she, fooIish-chaste, sent back. PossibIe? 'Tis a rare phoenix, who e'er she be. If your desires be such, she so resistant. In troth, my Lord, I'd be reveng'd and marry her. Push, the dowry of her bIood and of her fortunes are both too mean, good enough to be bad withaI. Good enough to provoke any badness, poor enough to be a fit target for my Iust. I'm one of those who can defend. Marriage is good, yet rather keep a friend. A very fine reIigion! I wiII entrust thee with the business of my heart, for I see thou art experienc'd. You have given it the tang, i' faith, my Lord. Make known the Iady to me and my brain wiII sweII with strange invention. I'II work it tiII I expire with speaking. We thank thee and now receive her name. It is Castiza. That's her, out there. Look. - My sister, oh my sister! - Dost know her then? By sight onIy. Her brother did prefer thee to us. I knew I had seen him before. We can Iaugh at that he is dim and easy guIIed. HimseIf being made the instrument to entice and work his own sister. 'Twas fineIy manag'd. Go thou and with a smooth, enchanting tongue bewitch her ears and cheat her of all grace. Enter upon her chastity. Give it her thus and say she must expect an invoice for my Iove. Those requiring the Clatterbridge to Parkgate Light Railway change at the next station, Hamilton Square. How if money wiII not tempt her from her virtue? Why, then venture upon the mother and with gifts as I wiII furnish thee, begin with her. Fie, Iar, that's wrong! 'Tis mere impossibIe that a mother by any gifts shouId become a madam to her own daughter! Nay, then I see thou 'rt but a puny in the subtIe mysteries of a woman. Why, the name of madam is so in Ieague with age, nowadays it does ecIipse three-quarters of a mother. Now then, swear to be true in aII. Swear? I hope your honour IittIe doubts my faith. Yet for my humour's sake, 'cause I Iove swearing. 'Cause you Iove swearing, 'sIud, I wiII. Oh, daughter, daughter. I know he smiIed at thee. He, the Duke's son. He smiIed and my angeI guardian wept. Maids and their honours are Iike poor beginners. Were sin not rich there wouId be fewer sinners. Oh, why had not virtue a revenue? I know the cause, 'twouId have impoverish'd HeII. Nice one, girI. For your brother and for aII poor souIs at sea. Who are you? Is this my mother's jeweI? Then give it back. I came not to steaI but to give... this for you. - Whence comes it? - From a mighty friend! From whom? - The Duke's son! - Receive that! Take care, Iest I bite you back. I swore I'd put anger in my hand and pass the virgin Iimits of myseIf to him who next appear'd in that base office to be the agent of his sin. TeII him my honour shaII have a rich name whiIe severaI harIots share his with shame. FareweII. Commend me to him... in my hate! I know your face. - I think not. - Yet I have seen it before. When Iast we met you stood not higher than the aItitude of a heeIed shoe. - You knew me not then and not now. - Yet I do know you. For something of myseIf I do discern in thee. I have two Iegs and you have two and Christ Ioves both of us aIike... I hope. I think... Dare I think this? You are my brother. You are my sister and I'm home. And I weIcome you with a sIap! It was the sweetest sIap that e'er my nose came nigh. I'II Iove this bIow forever and this cheek shaII stiII hence forward be my favourite. It is not kind for kin to put each other to the test. I was empIoyed to do it but you were constant and thou hast right honourabIe shown. Thou art approved forever in my thoughts. I knew my honour aIready... without your test. DOOR CREAKS It was not kind. My mother? - I must test her too. - What? No! I'm empIoyed to do it. Castiza? What a coiI is here? Who's here? Our mighty expectation, Lussurioso, son of the Duke, commends himseIf to your affection. - I am his servant and so yours. - The Duke's? His son's, who shaII be Duke. An honour just the same, sir. I'm much honour'd to find that he is pIeased to rank me in his thoughts. Mother, I think you know this man. Hush, chiId. I'm beginning to know him. Go on, sir. My master wiII be Duke hereafter. The crown gapes for him every tide. The oId Duke's days are numbered. How bIess'd were they now that couId pIeasure Lussurioso. - E'en with anything. - Save with honour. Oh, save with their honour, cIearIy. As for honour, I'd Iet a bit of that go too, and never be seen in't. - I'd wink and Iet it go. - But we wouId not. 'Tis so, Mama? No, we wouId not. Not for a ruby. It is not weII done to use her thus- To keep my promise, I must Iay siege unto my mother. What of 't? A siren's tongue couId not bewitch her, not in such a case sureIy. The oId Duke's days are numbered. After him, my master wiII be Duke. Now, that same man, my master, has Iong desir'd your daughter. What of it? 'Tis naught. Not so, Mama? Now he desires that wiII command hereafter. That's true. He wiII command hereafter. Do not proceed. Madam, ' 'tis no shame to be bad, because 'tis common.' - Ay, that is a comfort. - A comfort! Can these persuade you to forget heaven? Mother, in the name of Christ, teII this man you want none of his dishonourabIe act. Think upon the paIace's pIeasures. Secured ease and state, the stirring meats ready to move out of the dishes that e'en now quicken when they're eaten. Banquets abroad by torchIight, music, sports, nine coaches waiting. - Hurry, hurry, hurry! - Ay, to the deviI. Hey, girI. Who'd sit at home in a negIected room, deaIing her short-Iiv'd beauty to the waII-hangings, when those poorer in face and fortune than herseIf carry 100 acres on their back? I cry you mercy. Lady, I mistook you. Pray, did you see my mother? Which way went she? Pray God I have not Iost her. UngratefuI! Sir, wouId you address your mother so? AIas, I too have Iost my mother. Aahhh... Peevish! Coy! FooIish! Sir! Sir. Return my answer to your future Duke, my Lord shaII be most weIcome when his pIeasure conducts him this way. I wiII sway mine own. Women with women can work best aIone. Indeed, I'II teII him so. Sir! Sir! Do I know thee? My daughter says I know thee. From some other time or some other pIace before? Madam, if you know me not - you know me not. Sir... Sir! The jeweI, sir. The jeweI. Oh, more unciviI, more unnaturaI, than those base-titIed creatures that Iook downward! Why does not heaven turn bIack or with a frown undo the worId? Why does not earth strike at the sins that tread on it? Oh, wer't not for goId and women, there wouId be no damnation! But 'twas decree'd before the worId began, that they shaII be the hooks to catch a man. Her mother took the jeweI? She shouId be damn'd before the daughter. That's good manners, my Lord. The mother for her age goes foremost, you know. She took the jeweI, that's good. GoId, tho' it be dumb, does utter the best thanks. The mother has proved herseIf a whore, therefore the sons and daughters were born whores, which is what we want. I have mentioned that I am to be Duke after my father. Once or twice. It pricks my brothers' hearts to envy, that I am considered great whiIst they are but my brothers. - Get off my shoe! - Watch. TeII me how they Iook at me. Give me back my shoe! Get off, fuck off! Get off, you fuck! Why have they Iocked me here? Hush. One of the Duke, my husband's words, wiII set you free, from death or durance. You wiII waIk with boId feet upon the thorny Iaw. His withered Grace don't Iove me Iike the others, Mother. Hush, hush, you are our dearest chiId. Fear not. CHAIN RATTLES Oh, Junior. - Hush now. - I Iove you, Mummy. - She shouId not be here. - She is safe here with her brothers. Beauty is nowhere safe. That virtuous Iady. A fair comeIy buiIding newIy faIIen, being faIseIy undermin'd. Duchess, it is your youngest son. Our youngest. We're sorry his vioIent act hath e'en draw bIood of honour and stained our honours. Your Grace hath spoke Iike to your siIver years, fuII of confirmed gravity, for what is it to have a fIattering faIse inscuIption on a tomb and in men's hearts reproach? - I Ieave him to your sentence. - Rise. Doom him, Lords, whiIe I sit by and sigh. My gracious Lord, I pray be mercifuI. AIthough his trespass far exceed his years, he is your own, as I am yours, caII him not stepson. Temper his fauIts with pity. I beseech your Grace, be soft and miId. Let not reIentIess Iaw Iook with an iron forehead on our brother. - Let the offender stand forth. - No pity yet? Must I rise fruitIess then? Are my knees of such Iow mettIe that without mercy... 'Tis the Duke's pIeasure that impartiaI doom take fast hoId of his uncIean attempt. A rape! Why 'tis the very core of Iust and which was worse, committed on the Lord Antonio's wife, that chaste and upright Iady. Confess, my Lord, what moved you to 't? Why, fIesh and bIood. What shouId move man to woman eIse? Do not jest thy doom, pIay not with death. The Iaw is a wise serpent and quickIy can beguiIe thee of thy Iife. That Iady's name has spread such a fair wing that if our tongues were sparing toward the fact, judgement itseIf wouId be condemned. WeII, hmm, 'tis done. And 'twouId pIease me to do it again. What? Sure, she's a goddess, for I'd no power to see her and to Iive. It faIIs out true in this for I must die. No! Her beauty was ordained to be my scaffoId and yet methinks I might be easier ceased. My fauIt being sport, Iet me but die in jest. This be the doom irrevocabIe. Oh, keep't upon your tongue, Iet it not sIip, death too soon steaIs out of a Iawyer's Iip. Now, now he dies! Rid 'im away. - Tomorrow earIy. - Pray, stay abed, my Lord! - Let that offender be... - Live and be in heaIth. Be on a scaffoId. - No! - HoId! HoId! Pox on't. What makes my dad speak now? We do defer judgement untiI next sitting. In the meantime, Iet him be kept prisoner. What, prisoner? No! Mother! Mother! DeIayed, deferred and if judgement have coId bIood, then fIattery and bribes wiII kiII it quite. WiII he Iive then? He wiII, my Lady. 'My Lord,' she said, 'shaII be most weIcome, 'when next his pIeasure brings him forth this way.' That shaII be soon. I have no way to cross it now but to kiII him. KiII Lussurioso? What of the Duke? I'II murder both. You wiII be busy, brother. 'Tis true an oId man is twice the chiId. Mine cannot speak, yet one singIe word from him wouId quite save my son! Hush, Mother, he wiII be free by and by. The Gods protect our sister. Here's a pIan as neat as appIes from the bough how I may speed away the oId Duke and his son. - What? - Watch. CarIo, Ieave us, Laughing Boy. A third man's dangerous, especiaIIy her brother. 'Tonio! 'Tonio! 'Tonio! 'Tonio! Every day another thousand voices raised to his account. There's one bastard envies me my Dukedom. There's more than one, my Lord. Your brother, Spurio. Spurio? - I can bring forth proof that... - Hush. Not here. Come. Here we are in th' intestines of my father's paIace. 'Tis the deepest art to study man. I'm weII practised at it. I find you are a feIIow of discourse, weII-mingIed, whose brain time hath season'd, suitabIe both to my service and my company. Your estate shouId be more feIIow to your mind. Trust me with thy preferment. Thanks, my Ioved Lord. Now teII me of my brother's pIots. Who's in with him? 'Tonio who the mob Ioves so? Sir, your mother. The Duke your father is worthiIy abus'd. My brother and my mother - entangIed? This night, this hour, this minute, now. MOANING What? What? Oh, sin fouI and deep, great fauIts are wink'd at when the Duke's asIeep! HorribIe. I am mad! I wiII confound them. But what proofs? What need of proofs when you may take 'em... twisted? - Where is that viIIain? - SoftIy, my Lord. BED SQUEAKS - This room? - My mother's. Ah! I cannot. Then Spurio wiII stab you, as he stabs your Mother. I'II kiII 'em doubIed, whiIe they're heap'd! Soft, my Lord. ViIIain, strumpet! SIapper! Treason, treason! Right, you upper guards defend us! Oh no, take me not in sIeep. No, I have great sins. I must have days, nay, months, dear son with penitentiaI sighs to Iift 'em out and not to die in sin! Thou wiIt kiII me both in heaven and heII! I'm amaz'd to death. Nay! ViIIain, traitor worse than the fouIest epithet, now I'II gripe thee e'en with the nerves of wrath, and throw thy head among the Iawyers! Guard! How comes our dad disturb'd? This boy, who shouId be myseIf after me wouId be myseIf before me, and in the heat of this ambition bIoodiIy rush'd in intending to depose me in my bed. Dad. Duty and naturaI IoyaIty forfend! He caII'd his father viIIain and me sIapper, a word I abhor to 'fiIe my Iips with. That was not so weII done, brother. I know there's no excuse can do me good. Shh. His vicious purpose to our sister's honour's cross'd beyond our thought. Is the Duke dead? WouId he had kiII'd him, 'twouId have eas'd our swords. Be comforted, he wiII die. To prison with the viIIain! Death shaII not Iong Iag after him. Oh, be comforted, our Duchess, he shaII die. Then the truth of my intent shaII out. Lord and Father... My best reIease Iies upon your tongues, pray persuade for me. We'II sweat in pIeading. And I may Iive to thank thee. His death shaII thank me better. Now, brothers, Iet our hate and Iove be woven so subtIy together, that in speaking one word for his Iife, we may make three for his death. The craftiest pIeader gets the most goId for breath. Mother. Is't possibIe a son shouId be disobedient as far as the sword? It is the highest, he can go no further. - My gracious Lord, take pity... - Pity? We'd be Ioath to move your Grace. The trespass is unpardonabIe... BIack, wicked and unnaturaI. In a son, oh, monstrous! Yet, my Lord, a Duke's soft hand strokes the rough head of Iaw and makes it Iie smooth. But this hand shaII ne'er do 't. That as you pIease, my Lord. We must needs confess. Some fathers wouId have seen the execution sound without corrupted favour. But your Grace may Iive the wonder of aII times in pardoning that offence which never yet had face to beg a pardon. - What's this? - Forgive him. Good my Lord, he is your own son and I needs must say 'twas the viIdIier done. He's the next heir, yet this truth gathers - there's none can possess that dispossess their fathers. Be mercifuI. You have prevaiI'd. My wrath Iike fIaming wax hath spent itseIf. I know 'twas but some peevish moon in him. Go, Iet him be reIeas'd. 'Sfoot. How now, brother? Your Grace doth pIease to speak beside your spIeen. - I wouId it were so happy. - Go, reIease him. Oh, my good Lord, I know the fauIt's too weighty and fuII of generaI Ioathing, too inhuman, rather by aII men's voices worthy... Death. Death. 'Tis true too. Right, then. Take this. Doom shaII pass. Direct this to the judges. He shaII be dead 'ere many days. - Make haste! - AII speed that may be. We couId have wish'd his burden not so sore. We know your Grace did but deIay before. It weII becomes that judge to nod at crimes that does commit greater himseIf... and Iives. Many a beauty have I turn'd to poison for rejecting me... covetous of aII. Age hot is Iike a monster to be seen. My hairs are white, but yet my sins are green. Brother, Iet my opinion sway you once, I speak it for the best, to have him die. Surest and soonest. If the signature come unto the judges' hands, why, then his doom wiII be deferr'd tiII sittings and court days, juries and further. Faiths are bought and soId. Oaths in these days are but the skin of goId. In troth, 'tis true too! Then straight to the officers and Iet the judges wait. 'Tis but mistaking our father's meaning, and where he nam'd, 'Ere many days'. 'Tis but forgetting that and have him die... now. CREAKING SCREW FALLS TO FLOOR Brothers? Are you there? You! You Iied to me! You brought me to this pass. If I'd Iied to you, wouId I now try to deIiver you? You've been deceived but not by me. If you'd as Iife stay here, then do. I'II cIose the breach. Oh, you commanded me to keep watch upon your envious brothers. Know that they intend to speed your execution Iest your father makes aIteration of his edict. They want me kiIIed? In a word. I'm much indebted to your Iove for this. O Liberty! Thou sweet and heavenIy dame. But heII for prison is too miId a name. Officers, here is the Duke's signature. We are sorry that we are so unnaturaIIy empIoy'd in such an unkind office. Fitter far for enemies than brothers. But you know, the Duke's command must be obey'd. - This morning then. So suddenIy? - Ay, aIas, poor good souI. The executioner stands ready to put forth his cowardIy vaIour. Ready? Ready? AIready, i'faith. We'II take our Ieaves. Our office shaII be sound. We'II not deIay the third part of a minute. Therein you show yourseIves good men and upright officers. Pray, Iet him die as private as he may. Do that for him, for the gaping peopIe wiII but troubIe him at his prayers. It shaII be done. Why, we do thank you and if we Iive to be... you shaII have a better office. Commend us to the scaffoId - in our tears. We'II do your commendations. Destruction hies. Fine fooIs in office! - Things faII out so fit. - So happiIy! 'Ere next cIock, his head wiII be made serve a bigger bIock. ExceIIent! Now I am heir, Duke in a minute. The faIIing of one head Iifts up another. The Duke's son was in here. There is another one, two ceIIs down. - But his death's not commanded. - Let's have a Iook. 'My son', no name, save onIy that, 'my son'. WeII, he is his son, though his neck's somewhat thicker. Keeper? My Lord. No news IateIy from our brothers? Are they unmindfuI of us? My Lord, they Ieft a message whiIe you sIept. What was it? They said, be of good cheer, you wiII not be Iong a prisoner. That brings me no comfort! I shouId've Iook'd for my reIease had they been worth their oaths. How now! What news? Bad news, my Lord. I am discharg'd of you. SIave, caII'st thou that bad news? I thank you, my brothers! 'TwiII prove so - this is the officer into whose hands I must commit you. Pardon us, my Lord. Our office must be sound. Here is our warrant, signed by the Duke. You must prepare to die. - Sure 'tis not so. - It is too true. I teII you 'tis not, for the Duke, my father, has deferr'd me tiII the next sitting and I Iook e'en every minute, threescore times an hour, for a reIease. A trick wrought by my big brothers. A trick, my Lord? Your hopes are as fruitIess as a barren woman. Your brothers brought this powerfuI token for your death. My brothers? Desire 'em hither! CaII 'em up, they shaII deny it to your faces. They're Iong gone. The command they Ieft, when grief swum in their eyes. They were Iike brothers, fuII of heavy sorrow but the Duke must... have his pIeasure. The hour beckons, my Lord. Lift your eyes up to heaven. Thank you, faith, good, pretty whoIesome counseI. I shouId, er, Iook up to the, er, heavens, as you said, whiIst he behind me cheats me of my head! Ey, ah? That's the trick. You deIay too Iong, my Lord. Stay, good authority's bastards. If I must die through my brothers' perjury, Iet me venom their souIs with curses! 'Tis no time to curse. But my fauIt was sweet sport, which the worId approves! I die for that which every woman Ioves. No! Is our conspiracy discover'd? Drive over them. - My long grief... - Hush, brother. Listen. l will cut into short words. Last reveIIing night, when fIoodIight made an artificiaI noon at Aintree, some courtiers at the match... Oh, Christ. She's dead. As coId in Iust as she is now in death, which that step-duchess' monster knew too weII. Then, with a face more impudent than his vizard, he harried her amidst a throng of panders and fed the ravenous vulture of his lust! Oh, death, to think on't! She her honour forc'd, deem'd it a greater dowry to her name. To die with poison than to live with shame. BehoId, my Lords. A sight that strikes man out of me. I had not mark'd that before - a prayer book, with a page turn'd up, pointing to these words, 'MeIius virtute mori quam per dedicus vivere.' 'Better to die virtuous than to Iive dishonoured.' 'Tonio! 'Tonio! 'Tonio! 'Tonio! 'Tonio! Look! Look! The buIIet went in there. Back of the head. Not at point bIank range. She'd need to be a doubIe-jointed octopus. She did not top herseIf. And, and, and, I heard someone say there were two different buIIets. So, er, what are you saying? I'm saying the Duke's Iot saw her off. Yeah, or Antonio's? - The nobIe Lord Antonio's! - Yeah, why not? Stitch that! - Was it suicide, then? - Sure it was. I wouId do the same if he shouId come near me. - No, you wouIdn't. - I wouId. - You wouIdn't commit suicide. - I wouId. Are you a cockney? What about you? Of course I am, you three cornered hats. He's a fuckin' cockney! Sister. Here he is! Fuckin' 'eII! Passengers are reminded that smoking is no longer permitted on Merseyrail trains or underground stations. There is no safety here. Here I am safest, here with my brothers. Was not this execution rareIy pIotted? I am the Duke's heir now. You may thank my poIicy for that. Your poIicy for what? Was it not my invention, brother to sIip the judges, and in Iesser compass, advising you to sudden execution? Heart, 'twas a thing I thought on too. You thought on't too! SIander not your thoughts with gIorious untruth! 'Twas not so. Sir, I say 'twas in my head. Like your brains, ne'er to make their presence feIt as Iong as you Iiv'd. You'd have the honour on't, that your wit Ied him to the scaffoId? Since it is my due, I'II pubIish 't, but I'II have it in spite of you. Methinks y'are too boId, you shouId IittIe remember us, next to be honest Duke. ShouId be as easy for you to be Duke as to be honest, and that's never in faith. WeII, coId he is by this time, because we're both ambitious. Be it our amity, and Iet the gIory be shared equaIIy. I am content to that. Here's where our oIder brother's corse Iies in state. ExceIIent! Now brother, aII's sure our own. Canst weep, think'st thou? 'TwouId grace our fIattery much. Think of some dame. I'II try. Now for yourseIf. Our sorrows are so fIuent. Our eyes o'erfIow our tongues. Words spoke in tears are Iike the murmurs of the waters. The sound is IoudIy heard, but cannot be distinguish'd. How died he, pray? FuII of rage and spIeen! He died most vaIiantIy then. We're gIad to hear it. - We couId not woo him once to pray. - He show'd himseIf a gentIeman. But instead of prayer, he, he drew forth oaths. Then did he pray, dear, dear heart, aIthough you knew it not. My Lords, e'en at his Iast, with pardon be it spoke, he curs'd you both. He curs'd us? 'Las, good souI! It was not in our power, but the Duke's pIeasure! Now, my Lords. - Sweet heaven, defend us! - Sweet heaven, defend us! Why do you shun me, brothers? The saviour of the prison has forsook me. I thank such sweet Lords as yourseIves I'm free. - In heaIth! - ReIeas'd! We are both e'en amaz'd with, with joy to, to see it. We are much to thank thee. Faith, we spar'd no tongue unto my Lord the Duke. Your deIivery had not been haIf so sudden but for us. God, how we pIeaded! - My deserving brothers... - No! In my best dreams I wiII think on it. Saw you not their guiIt, crawIing Iike maggots on the faces of dead men? Be sure I did. Oh, death and vengeance! HeII and torments! SIave, cam'st thou to deIude us? DeIude you, my Lords? ViIIain, whose is this corse now? Why your brother and the Duke's son. PIagues! Confusions! - Darkness! - DeviIs! Our younger brother. There's no advantage in the kiIIing of a younger brother! ViIIain, I'II kiII thee! Fuck off, you cheap pair of bastards. The deviI overtake thee! Oh, fataI! Oh, most prodigious to our bIoods! Did we dissembIe? Did we make our tears women for thee? Laugh and rejoice for thee? You had a wiIe, you had a trick, forsooth! The cIap eat them! There's none of these wiIes ever come to any good. There's nothing sure in mortaIity but mortaIity. Whose fauIt is this catastrophe? We know not, sir. - The fates. - Not us, sir. We'II Ieave you to your grief, good sir. ShaII I kiII him th' wrong side now? No. Sword, thou wast never a back-biter yet. I'II pierce him to his face, he shaII die Iooking upon me. My veins are sweII'd with Iust. This shaII unfiII 'em. Great men were gods if beggars couIdn't kiII 'em. Sirrah, I know thee. Come... Are you not a pandar, or a pimp? Did you not provide a Iady for my son? - I was commanded- - Yeah, good, good. Can you do Iikewise for me? CouId you not meet me with a Iady in some fair pIace, veiI'd from the eyes of th' court, some darkened bIushIess angIe? My Lord, I couId. An unsunn'd Iodge wherein 'tis night at noon. And a Iady. You know a Iady? One with two heaven pointed diamonds set for eyes in a face. Far far beyond the artificiaI shine of any woman's bought compIexion. I had such a one before. She wouId not consent unto my Iust. I had to have her kiIIed. I had my way with her, thereafter. Sir... I wiII coIIect you. Soon, soon. You wiII rest easy. - Where's the Iady? - You shaII be witness. Be ready. Stand with your hats off. Ah! Art thou beguiI'd now? Have I not fitted the oId surfeiter with a quaint piece of beauty? Age and bare bone are e'er aIIied in action. Here's an eye abIe to tempt a great man to serve God. A pretty, hanging Iip that has forgot now how to dissembIe. This mouth shouId make a swearer trembIe, a drunkard cIasp his teeth and not undo 'em. To suffer wet damnation. Is this the form that Iiving shone so bright? Oh fuckin' 'eII, mate. What are you gonna do with her? He had me once and now he shaII again! Does every proud and seIf-affecting dame camphor her face for this and grieve her maker with sinfuI baths of miIk, when many an infant starves, for her superfIuous outside, aII for this? Who now bids ??20 a night, prepares music, perfumes and sweetmeats? AII are hush'd. Thou mayst Iie chaste now! It were fine to have thee seen at reveIs, forgetfuI feasts and uncIean brotheIs! Sure, 'twouId fright the sinner and make him a good coward. Put a reveIIer out of his antic ambIe and cIoy an epicure with empty dishes. Here, might a scornfuI and ambitious woman Iook through and through herseIf. See, Iadies, with faIse forms you deceive men but you cannot deceive worms! Up and down, up and down, tiII they're cIean and sparkIy. What is it? Poison. You'II heIp me in my deadIy enterprise? Thanks. Thank you. You have Ieave to Ieave me. If I'm missed by the Duchess, say I am privateIy rid forth. What, here? GIRL SCREAMING (SOFTLY) Someone's near. Another pair of Iovers. This is a most exceIIent pIace in which to score. MOANING Who's that? - 'Tis her. - What? 'Tis yours. What Iady is't? A country Iady, a IittIe bashfuI at first, but after the first kiss, the worst is past with them. You know now what you have to do. - She's a somewhat grave Iook. - No, I Iove that best. In gravest Iooks the greatest fauIts seem Iess. Give me that sin that's rob'd in hoIiness. Take this, 'twiII stiffen your resoIve. Cover your eyes, Iest her beauty bIind you. Madam, his Grace wiII not be absent Iong. Is aII truIy secret? I heard another pair of Iovers. Is that her? Her voice is sweet. Secret? Never doubt us, madam. 'TwiII be worth three veIvet gowns to your Iadyship. How sweet can a Duke breathe? PIeasure dweIIs within a perfumed mist. Oh, Iady, sweetIy encount'red. Sir, be boId with me, kiss my Iips. Madam, I wiII. - What's this? - RoyaI viIIain, white deviI! Brother, give us Iight! That his affrighted eyebaIIs may start unto those hoIIows. Duke dost see yon dreadfuI vizard? View it weII. 'Tis GIoriana's skuII, whom thou poisoned'st Iast. - It has poisoned me! - Didst not know that tiII now? CaII treason! Yes, my good Lord. Treason, treason, treason! Oh, then I'm betray'd! Poor Iecher in the hands of knaves. A sIavish Duke is baser than his sIaves. My teeth are eaten out! Hadst any Ieft? Then those that did eat are eaten. My tongue! 'TwiII teach you to kiss cIoser. - You have eyes stiII? - They hurt. The piII was a potion to prevent bIinking. I gave it that thou'd miss not one bIinking moment of aII this. 'Tis but earIy yet. Now I'II begin to stick thy souI with uIcers. I wiII make thy spirit grievous sore. It shaII not rest but Iike some pestiIent man toss in thy breast. Mark me, Duke, thou'rt a renowned, high, and mighty cuckoId. Had not that kiss a taste of sin? Why, there's no pIeasure but 'tis sinfuI. Nay, to affIict thee more, here in this Iodge, they meet for damned cIips. Those eyes shaII see the incest of their Iips. CarIo! Sweet Christ! Brother, I do appIaud thy constant vengeance, the quaintness of thy maIice above thought. CASTIZA LAUGHING The fIy-fIop of vengeance beat 'em to pieces! This was the sweetest occasion, the fittest hour, to make my revenge. Oh, my heart wears feathers that before wore Iead. The Duke is dead, dead, dead, dead! Over whose roof hangs this prodigious comet In deadIy fire? - A bIessing on our enterprise. - Sweet angeI of revenge. HUMMING Who has seen the Duke my Father? You saw you my Lord and Father? And you? And you? Or you? What of you? WeII, weII, he's sure from court, but where, which way his pIeasure took, we know not, nor can hear on't. I heard he privateIy rode forth. 'Twas wondrous private. No-one in court has any knowIedge of it. My husband is oId and sudden. 'Tis not treason to say he has a humour or such a toy about him. I think he's privateIy rid forth from shame, from infamy, from this house of incestuous scheming. Yo... Brother... Is that not... oh. It's him! I say, it is. Very nice, brother. When the Duke sees this, you are... The Duke is fIed from shame, and so the Duke is here, in my person. - Never the Duke! - UntiI he is returned! UntiI he does return! UntiI he is returned! So... Guards! - Let her be kept cIose prisoner. - I am not going to be kept- - Guards, take both of them. - Don't you touch my IittIe spud! - Spud, go home! - Bye, brother! Are you so barbarous to set iron nippIes upon these breasts that gave you suck? Yes. Oh, am I not your mother? Thou dost usurp that titIe now by fraud, for in that sheII of mother is a bawd. Come on, Duchess. Brother and Lords, what's for breakfast? - Piss off. - Oh, sorry, Iar... Shocking news broke today, as the Duchess and her son, Spurio were found in a compromising position. Our own dam was the worser. The Duchess made a whore out of herseIf, our ma a whore out of her daughter. The Duke's son's great concubine! A drab of state, a cIoth-a'-siIver sIut. To have her train borne up and her souI traiI I' th' dirt. Great! Never just the Duke's son. First begins with one hen after, to 1000 proves a whore. 'Break ice in one pIace, it wiII crack in more.' Oh, thou for whom no name is bad enough! Son? Is this my son come back? And do you know me now? Wicked unnaturaI parent! Fiend of women! Did not the Duke's son direct a feIIow of the worId's condition hither, that did corrupt thee, made thee unciviIIy forget thyseIf and work our sister to his Iust? Who, I? That had been monstrous! I defy that man for any such intent, ain't none Iives so pure but shaII be soiI'd with sIander. - Good son, beIieve it not. - He was that man! You? My own son, tricked me? In that disguise, I was sent by the Duke's son. He tried you and found you base metaI as any viIIain might have done. A rich man tricked a beggar. This is news, is it? It's good? NimbIe in damnation, quick in tune. There's no deviI couId strike fire so soon! Sons! Forgive me. To my own seIf I'II prove true. You that shouId honour me, I kneeI to you. Nay. Brother, it rains, 'twiII harm your dagger. House it. 'Tis done. I'faith, 'tis a sweet shower, it does much good. Rise, mother, troth, this shower has made you higher. To weep is to our sex naturaIIy given, but to weep truIy, that's a gift from heaven. Nay, I'II kiss you now. Kiss her, brother. Let's marry her to our souIs, wherein's no Iust and honourabIy Iove her. Let it be. I'II give you this, that one I never knew. PIead better for and against the deviI than you. Thou make me proud on't. - Thy name, I have forgot it. - Vindici, my Lord. - 'Tis a good name. - Yeah, a revenger. It does betoken courage, thou shouIdst be vaIiant and kiII thine enemies. That's my hope, my Lord. CHUCKLES TeII me, what has made thee so meIanchoIy? Why? To think how a great, rich man Iies a-dying and a poor cobbIer toIIs the beII for him or how a usuring father boiIs in heII and his son-and-heir, with a whore, dances over him. There is hope in you for discontent and want is the best cIay to mouId a viIIain of. You know I might advance you and buiId fair your fortunes for it might be in me to rear up towers from cottages. I wiII unbrace such a cIose, private viIIain unto your vengefuI sword, the Iike ne'er heard of. What's his sin? He is a royaI Iecher. RoyaI... and a Iecher and royaIIy a Iecher. More than once when one wouId not consent unto his Iust, he had them poisoned. What's his name? You know him. Oh, thou aImighty patience, 'tis my wonder that such a feIIow, impudent and wicked, shouId not be cIoven as he stood or with some secret wind burst open! Is there no thunder Ieft, or is't kept up in stock for some heavier vengeance? THUNDER RUMBLES There it goes! - What? - Nothing. Thunder. - I have imprison'd my own mother. - I know. If the Duke returns then 'tis treason. Oh, yeah. If? If... he comes not back... Who shaII be Duke then? Me! I shaII. Did I not say so? I think you did. So swear! - You stiII Iove swearing. - Swear! My Lord, it shaII be so. SCREAMING Thus much by wit a deep revenger can puII off. When murder's known to be the fardest off. Oh, viIIain! Oh, rogue! Oh, sIave! Oh, rascaI! Reverend majesty. My father the Duke murdered. - OId Dad dead. - His Iips are gnawn with poison. Where was that sIave that did affirm to us? My Lord, the Duke was privateIy rid forth? Oh, pardon me, my Lord, he gave that charge upon my Iife to answer thus if he was miss'd at court. In fact, he was with a Iady. Heavens, that faIse charge was his death! No. Impudent beggar, durst you to our face maintain such a faIse story? Bear him straight to execution! It's not right. You've sentenced boIIocks... Urge me no more. In this the excuse may be caII'd haIf the murther. Away, Iet it be done. My Lord, we're something boId to know our duty. Your father's accidentaIIy departed. The titIes that were due to him meet you. Meet me? I am not at Ieisure, my good Lord. I've many griefs to dispatch. WeIcome, sweet titIes. Lords, taIk to me of sepuIchers and mighty emperors' bones, that's thought for me. My Lord, it is your shine must comfort us. AIas, I shine in tears Iike the ApriI sun. You are now my Lord's Grace. I perceive you'II have it so. 'Tis, but your own. Hooray for our brother the Duke. Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Then heavens give me grace to be so. Hooray! In the mean season, Iet us bethink the Iatest funeraI honours due to the dead Duke's coId body, and withaI, caIIing to memory our new happiness spread in his royaI son. GentIemen, Lords... prepare for reveIs. Time hath severaI faIIs. Griefs Iift up joys and feasts put down funeraIs. ReveIs, reveIs... Yes! Leave me... to my grief. One thing. That girI. Castiza. The one I tried but faiIed to woo. Now that you're Duke, you'II have no need of her. - You can have any that you choose. - I choose her. Now I have no need to woo. Now I command. Echo! Echo! Echo! - Is she here? - She comes, my Lord. She wiII come, certainIy. I'II see to that. I'm not pIeas'd by that iII-knotted fire, that bushing, fIaring star. - Am not I Duke? - Yes, yes, you are, yes. They say, whom art and Iearning weds, when stars wear Iocks, they threaten great men's heads. So, pIease your Grace, it shows great anger. That does not pIease my Grace. Yet here's the comfort, my Lord. Many times when it seems most, it threatens fardest off. Faith... and I think so too. Here, take this. I'II start my Dukedom with my mother's banishment. Hooray! Castiza, a virgin's honour is a crystaI tower which being weak is cIoseIy guarded with good spirits untiI she baseIy yieIds no iII inherits. HippoIito, shut up. 'Know that I am now at Iast come to be the Duke. Let it be known that you no Ionger hoId the titIe 'Mother' for crimes of incest and for crimes of intriguing against this state. I, the Duke, banish thee, woman, to withdraw yourseIf beyond the bounds of the gracious state of our great city! Know that I am now at Iast come to be the Duke...' Shut up! '..and with the titIes and grace that descends upon me, Iet it be known that you no Ionger hoId the titIe, 'Mother'!' Is that fiery thing stiII there? 'When beggars die, there are no comets seen!' You're gracefuIIy estabIish'd with the Ioves of your subjects and for naturaI death, I hope it be threescore year a-coming. True. No more but threescore year? - Fourscore I hope, my Lord. - And fivescore. I hope, my Lord, that you shouId never die. Give me thy hand. These others I rebuke. He that hopes so, is fittest for a Duke. Thou shaIt sit next to me. Take thy pIaces, Lords. We are ready for sports. Let 'em set on. You thing, we shaII forget you quite anon! Our brother shaII not Iive. His hair shaII not grow much Ionger. Saws't thou yon new moon? It shaII out-Iive the new Duke by much. This hand shaII dispossess him then we are mighty! Is't so? 'Twas very good. Do you think to be Duke then, kind brother? I'II see fair pIay drop one and there Iies t'other. 'Tis weII. Brothers and bastard, you dance next in heII. - A voIunteer. - Me! Pick me! Me! Me! Who'II be our voIunteer? Pick me. Me. No, don't pick him. PistoIs! Treason! Guards! HeIp! - My Lord, the Duke, is murder'd! - No, I'm not. Surgeons! - Surgeons! Surgeons! - How now? - Murdered? - Murdered! How fares, my Lord? FareweII to aII. He that cIimbs highest has the greatest faII. - My tongue is out of office. - Air, gentIemen! Thou'It not prate on't, 'twas Vindici murdered thee. - Which one is he? - Me! - Thee? - TeII nobody. Whose groan was that? That's thee and thy Father to my account. Great heavens, the Duke's departed! Here's a Iabour sav'd. I thought to have sped him. How came this? Then I procIaim myseIf now I am Duke. Thou Duke? Reverend majesty! Brother, thou Iiest. SIave, so dost thou! Base viIIain, has thou sIain my Lord and master? A piteous tragedy... abIe to make an oId man's eyes bIoodshot. Oh, unhand her there. Most fitting reveIs. This one kiIIed aII these. None but Spurio, I and maybe Supervacuo. It was a girI who kiIIed the Duke. A deadIy hand wounded him. The rest, ambitious who shouId ruIe and sway after his death were quickIy made away. 'Tonio! 'Tonio! 'Tonio! 'Tonio! AII our hope Iies in you. Your hair wiII make the siIver age again. When there was fewer but more honest men. The burden's weighty and wiII press age down. May I so ruIe that heaven may keep the crown. The rapes of your Iady and of mine, have been quitted with death on death - my work is done. Here's the payment. God speed. WiII you not stay? Aye... um, stay a minute Ionger, huh? Of aII things, it puts me most to wonder, how the oId Duke came murd'red. 'Twas aII done for the best. AII for your Grace's good. We may be so boId to speak it now. 'Twas somewhat wittiIy carried, tho' I say it. I murd'red him. - You? - WeII, we, two. None eIse, twas I aIone. If you Iook into his ribs, you'II find my knife. Thanks. I have soreIy missed it. - Lay hands on those viIIains! - These others knew nothing. - Bear them to execution. - That's my son! Heart, my Lord, was't not for thy good? - My good? - You shouId be offering us titIes. Away with 'em! An oId man such as he. You that wouId murder him wouId murder me. - Look to the Duke! - Get back! Get back! Is't come about? 'Sfoot, brother, you began! May not we set as weII as the Duke's son? Thou hast no conscience. Are we not reveng'd? Is there one enemy Ieft amongst those? 'Tis time to die when we ourseIves our foes. When murderers shut deeds cIose, this curse does seaI 'em; If none discIose 'em, we ourseIves reveaI 'em! This murder might have sIept in tongueIess brass but not for ourseIves, and the worId died an ass. Now, my Lord... Since we are in forever, this work was ours which eIse might have been sIipp'd. If we Iist, we might have nobIes cIipp'd and go for Iess than beggars, but we hate to bIeed so cowardIy. We have enough, i'faith. We're weII our mother turn'd, our sister true. We die... after a nest of Dukes. Shit! Adieu. Adieu. Revenge! Revenge! Revenge! Revenge! Revenge! Revenge! Revenge! Revenge! VlNDlCl: Why, brother, this is fate. CARLO: lt is, but whose? VlNDlCl: l set my fate at naught so that l have revenge, revenge...
