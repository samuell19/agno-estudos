(sleigh bells) (bright instrumental music) - Oh, for crying out loud, Dobbs, you made me miss the turn. - Where are we going, Harold? - Oh, you'll see, Dobbs. You'll see. - Where is he? Have you seen him, Jerkins? - I saw him headed for the door about a half hour ago. - Was he? - Yeah, smiling like some kinda fool. - Gentlemen, please. Mr. Cavanaugh has been delayed at another meeting, but he should be with you shortly. If you wouldn't mind waiting? - Oh, we'll wait. - I don't get it, Harold. What are we doing in this burg? - Yeah well, there's a lot you don't get, Dobbs. I've been working on old man Cavanaugh for a couple of years now and I got him right where I want him. - Yeah, but Harold, this place ain't gonna order enough to pay for gas to drive out of here. - See this old guy, Dobbs? That's Frederick Cavanaugh. Now, he's the father of the old coot that we're here to see today. Owned this store and several others in the area. But it seems that he and his son, Samuel, had a falling out. So the kid heads off to Boston to make his fortune. Founded Cavanaugh's Department Stores. - The Cavanaugh's Department Stores? - Boston, Philly, New York, D.C., all over the place. (cheerful instrumental music) - Hey, Michael. - Watch it. - Where's you get the stupid skates? - Or boats. - Pontoons, Mikey skates on pontoons. Never seen anybody stand on their ankles before. Nasty wind out here today, you know what I mean? - Hey, whoa! Ohh! - Let's get out of here. - Are you all right? - Yeah, I'm okay. - Those skates are kinda big for you, aren't they? - They're my dad's, mine pinch. - Ah, here come on. - They're good skates, they just don't have any brakes. - (laughing) I know what you mean. (car horn honking) I'm coming, I'm coming. - Whoa, he can skate. (car horn honking) - I'm sick of these people. Con artists, that all they are, con artists. (church bell ringing) - Church bells are off again. - Aw man, late again. - Nothing works right anymore. - He's gonna kill me. - Nothing. (car horn honking) - Okay, so then along comes the war. This is World War Two now, not Korea. And by now, our Samuel has a kid. Except his kid buys the farm on the first boat ashore at Normandy, and old Sam goes crazy. A year later, the Missus dies, too. So old Sam packs up and comes home to this wide spot in the road, buys back the old family home, buys back the old family store, and now he runs this entire huge Cavanaugh Department Store chain from this little two-bit office. - Yeah, but Harold, what happened to Frederick? - Frederick? Dobbs, you haven't heard a word I've said, have you? - Yeah Harold, I was just wondering. - It doesn't make any difference. He died or something. He's be older than dirt. Look, the only thing you gotta remember is that I'm about to close on the biggest deal since the Indians traded away Manhattan Island. Do you have any idea the size of the commission that I'm going to make on this deal from good old Dunkin and Dunkin? - But Harold, why'd he come back here? - All right, let's go. Thank you, Robby. - You two still here? Thought you'd be long gone. ♫ Away in a manger ♫ No crib for his bed ♫ The little Lord Jesus ♫ lay down his sweet head ♫ The stars in the sky ♫ looked down where he lay ♫ The little Lord Jesus ♫ asleep on the hay ♫ (baton rapping) - Michael Grant. Mr. Grant, tardiness is a fault I will not tolerate. It is an insult full of disrespect. You will stay late and polish pews. - Yes sir, I'm sorry Mr. Posey. - And, regrettably, our young Mary was not listening for her cue. Just because your brother thinks he can waltz in here whenever he chooses is not re. . . well, do try to pay attention, Becky. All right, we shall begin again. And this time hopefully, with no further unnecessary interruptions. And, ♫ Away in a manger ♫ No crib for his bed ♫ The little Lord Jesus ♫ lay down his sweet head ♫ The stars in the sky ♫ looked down where he lay ♫ The little Lord Jesus ♫ asleep on the hay ♫ (children laughing) - Children, (children laughing) children just settle down. Let's, oh let's just take a short break shall we? Children, shh, shh, stop all this silliness. John, John would you help me with this please? - (sighs) Michael, you may go now. But next time, try to be on time, eh? - Yes, sir, thank you sir, Mr. Posey. Come on, Becky, we're going to be late. Hurry, Becky. Come on, Becky, hurry. Becky, if you don't hurry up, we're gonna be late. And then mom's gonna be ma. . . what are you carrying? - I got the baby, Michael. I was scared he'd be all lonely in the church by himself. I'm his mommy and I've got to take care of him. - [Michael] Gosh, Becky. - I wish I had a doll like him. - You should have left him in the church, Becky. He's not yours. You gotta be real careful. - Michael, do you think Mommy could buy me one for Christmas? - You're nuts, Becky. Mom can hardly afford to pay the bills and buy us food and stuff. - Hey, Michael, your father's nothing but a stinky cow. - He is not. - He is so, he's a stinkin' deserter. - You're lying, take it back, he's coming home. - Oh yeah, he's probably dead by now. He won't be needing these. (boys yelling, encouraging Butch) (boys laughing) - Ha, look at that. - Let's get out of here. - They broke the baby. - I'm really sorry, Becky. - What am I going to do, Michael? Mr. Posey will take away my part in the play. - Take this in and put it under you coat. But don't bother Mom about it. Tell her I'll be home as soon as I can. Don't worry, I'll think of something. Oh no. - [Santa] Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas, (jingle bells jingling) Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas young man. Merry Christmas, ho ho, Merry Christmas. - The doll. - [Santa] Merry Christmas. - Young man, young man, I'd like to see the china dolls, please. - Is there a particular doll you'd be interested in? - Oh, I'd like to see the entire collection. - Of course. - [Store clerk] These are our finest European dolls. - (sighs) My daughter. Do you know that she has opened up everything that I've gotten her for Christmas, and wrapped it up again. Isn't that hysterical? (laughing) Well, at least this will be one thing that's still a surprise. What's the price on this one? - Ah, let's see. That one is $12.95. I'll take it, and I'd like it gift wrapped. - Yes ma'am, will that be everything for you tonight? Probably not. - Hey, you! Stop, thief! - Merry Chris-- uh. - Stop, stop thief! - Uh. - Hold on there young fellow. Where ya going in such a hurry? - Uh. - Don't let that little thief run away. - I'd hate to be in his shoes. Probably trying to steal a Christmas present. Old Scrooge will probably make sure he gets life with no parole. (knocking on the door) - Come in. - Mr. Cavanaugh, this hoodlum was caught stealing merchandise. - Yeah well, toss him in jail and throw away the key, for all I care. People who want something for nothing. I have no patience with that. - Mr. Cavanaugh, maybe there's some way we can work this out. Maybe an arrangement where he could work this off. - What kind of work would you . . . suggest? Oh well, maybe there's something that he could do? - Does that mean you won't arrest me? - I'm not going to arrest you, just don't let this happen again, though. Next time, you might not be so lucky. - But sir, I caught him red-handed. - Winston, that's all right, I'll take it from here. You just go back to your counter. - Sir, I don't think we should. - Winston out, now. What's your name, son? - Michael, Michael Grant. - Well let me ask you something. I mean, why did you take this. I mean, a doll? - My sister, she . . . - You mean you took this for your sister? - No, yes, see, Butch beat me up and took my dad's skates. And Becca was holding the china babydoll for a Christmas play. And she got knocked down and it broke. - You mean that boy that pushed you out on the ice today? - How do you? Was that you? - I want you to report to me, nine a.m. sharp tomorrow, you understand? - Yes, sir. - [Officer] Come on. (fingers drumming) - Winston, will you come in here for a moment? Does the name Grant mean anything to you? - You're referring to the boy who was in here, sir? - I was. - I believe his mother is Jenny Grant. She works over at the diner. The father is Phillip Grant. I think he's listed as missing in action. - Okay, I think you're going to have to make a delivery for me, Winston. - The best thing we can do is just go to Mr. Posey and tell him what happened. That Butch is just a bully, everyone knows that. It wasn't Becky's fault. - Mom, Becky will lose her part. Mr. Posey won't care what happened. (door bell rings) - Good evening, Mrs. Grant. I'm Bob Winston, I work for Cavanaugh's. Mr. Cavanaugh asked me to deliver this for the children. It's for their play. I believe the children need a baby. - Oh thank you, thank you. But how did Mr. Cavanaugh know? - I was just asked to deliver it, ma'am. - [Mrs. Grant] Thank you. It's from Mr. Cavanaugh, down at the store. But how did he know? - Dad. Mom, it's really late. - Yes it is, Mister, and what are you doing up? - I was thirsty. - Okay, well get yourself a drink and then get back to bed. (water running) - Mom, do you miss Dad? - Come here, Michael. Of course I do, you know that. We all do. - Well, Butch says Dad's a coward and is dead. I'm starting to forget what Dad's like. I really hate this dumb war, Mom. - Oh honey, we all hate the war. But it will over soon. And we got to keep hoping and praying that he's all right. We can't give up, right? - You should get some sleep too, Mom. You're working too much. - I'll be okay. Now, get to bed, I love you. - Good morning. - I said I'd give you an answer soon, and I will. Now good-bye. (phone receiver slams) - I'm reporting for duty, sir. - Dunkin and Dunkin, they think they can pawn off anything on you. And don't you even think of taking that coat off, young man. I want you to carry out some experiments for me, all right? I want you to test some toys and some sports equipment. Let's just, well let's call it science. - Science? - Yes, science. And we're going to start with Dunkin and Dunkin toboggans. Those idiots, those idiots think that I'm some stupid old man that's gonna discontinue with my old manufacture people that I have worked with for years, and sign an exclusive with them just because they did a little underbidding? Well, there's such a thing as quality, and there's such a thing as safety. I know when a product is cheaply made, but I need proof, huh? That's where you come in, young man. - Yes, sir? - I want you to take that toboggan down the roughest terrain. Son, do you know what the word terrain means? - Uh, big mountain? - No, it means ground, rough ground. I want you to put it through its paces. I want you to pile on as many kids as you can. And then I want you to report back to me at 3:15. Is that understood? - Yes, sir. - Let me see your mitts. Not good enough, come with me. (light-hearted instrumental music) (Michael screaming) (crashing and cracking) - Yes, but Mr. Cavanaugh, we can show you how to substantially improve your profit margin on your entire sporting goods line. (knock at the door) - Come in. - Oh, sorry, sir, I'll wait outside. - No, Michael, come in, come in, and bring that toboggan with you. - Looks like you made mincemeat out of that, huh son? What happened, boy? - Well, it's hard to steer. - Look, this is preposterous. You can't give some kid a piece of equipment like this and expect any kind of reliable. . . - Who better to determine if a toboggan is good? Are we selling to martians, or are we selling to children? - Uh, he's right there, Harold. - Oh, shut up, Dobbs. - Excuse me, Michael. Crabbe, if you want Cavanaugh business, you're gonna have to do better than that. Thank you very much. - Then you're not mad at me? - I couldn't be happier, Michael. I've been trying to get rid of that fast-talker for weeks. Hey, that gives me another good idea. How would you like to test some skates today? - Skates? Yeah, sure, as long as I'm back for rehearsal. - We won't be late. Come here. (laughing) Uh, I don't think so. I definitely do not think so. Hey, give me that hat. Oh, oh, I got it, I got it, I got it. Perfect.

I want to know if it's worth re-ordering, okay? - Yes, sir, I'll report back. Hey, why don't you come with me? - Me? No, I'm too busy. - Please? - No, I am too busy. - Please? - Okay. (energetic instrumental music) - Come on, get back there. - I want a ride. - Everyone ready? Let's go. (children cheering) - A new record time. (laughing) Well come on, fellas, come on, join in. - Go on and go, I know you want to. - Are you sure about this? - Go on! - Come on, fellas. (laughing) Why doesn't Butch join in? I mean, what's his problem? - I don't know, he's just Butch. - Hey, Ralph, isn't it? - Yeah. - Come on, what's the real story? - Um, ah. - Come on. - Well, don't tell him I told ya. Well, he's mad 'cause his father died. He died in the war. - Yes, that could make you angry. Very angry. - Oh hi, honey. - Hi Mom. Mr. Cavanaugh, this is my mom and this is my sister, Becky. - Hi, I'm Jenny. - Hi, I'm Becky. - Well, Merry Christmas, Becky. Merry Christmas to you too, Jenny. - I want to thank you for all that you've done for Michael. - Oh, believe me, it's nothing compared to what he's done for me. - Thank you. - Oh, (laughing) - Well, I guess we'd better go, kids. - [Mr. Cavanaugh] Good night. - Good night. - Good night, Michael. See you tomorrow. Good night, Becky. (dog barking in the distance) (clock ticking) - Thank you for my mom, my sister, and thank you for my friend, Mr. Cavanaugh. And please take care of my dad, I know he's alive. And if you can find a way, please bring him home for Christmas, he's all I want, amen. - [Becky] Amen. (door bells clanking) - All right honey, we'll see you later. - Bye. - Have a good day. - Good morning. - It is a good morning, Michael. (laughing) There we go. Michael, hand me that bow, will ya? - Yeah, here. - Thank you. How's it look? - Great. - All right. Well sir, let me ask you something Michael. If you could have anything you wanted for Christmas, what would it be? - Anything? - Yes, anything. - If I could just have one wish, I'd wish for my dad for Christmas. I pray that he'll come home every night. - I used to pray. Pray that my son would come home. Even after we got the news that he was killed, I kept praying. Praying there was some mistake, that he'd been, you know, taken for someone else, and that, well, he'd come home. - I kind of look like him, huh? - Yeah. - Is that why you're so nice to me? - Well, maybe at first. Not anymore. (church bells ringing) Well, there's those bells again. And they're off, it's no the hour. Some people say that when those bells toll at odd hours, like right now, it means that your prayers have been answered. You keep asking, Michael. Don't ever give up. My prayers were answered. I mean, not in the way I expected. But they were answered. (sleigh bells jingling) (children cheering, playing excitedly) (lively instrumental music) (children cheering) (lively instrumental music) - You know I'd help you if I could, Jenny. But I'm barely making it myself. I had hoped that the Christmas season would make a difference, but. - I. I just, I don't know what I'm gonna do. I mean, the government money helps, but I may just have to leave the kids at Phil's mother and look for something out of town, maybe even out of state. We just . . . Becky, come here, come here honey. Stay right here. Michael? Honey? I'm sorry you had to hear that. - I don't want you to go away and leave us. - Oh, I don't want that to happen, either honey. But we, we just, we can't make it on our own. - I'll help, I'll get a job. I won't eat so much. Just don't go off and leave us. - Oh, I wouldn't just go off and leave you. You'd be staying with your grandma for a little while. It wouldn't be for very long. - But Dad will be coming home soon, and then things will be okay. - I hope so, Michael, I hope so. (birds chirping) - Michael, you don't seem too happy today. Is something bothering you? - Nah, I'm okay. - Well, if you want to talk about it, I'm your man. - I'm worried about my mom. She's working too hard. - Hey everybody, gather around. There's another train comin' in. I just heard a news report. There's another troop train coming through tomorrow night and there will be men from all over the state on it. And they say there might be some wounded and missing in action. - [Winston] We gotta get everybody down to the train. - Yes, let's go down and wish them a Merry Christmas. - Mr. Cavanaugh, did you hear what he said? - I heard, Michael. - My dad's on that train, I know it. - Well, I'll tell you what, I'll come by tomorrow and I'll pick up your mother, and your sister, and you and take you to that train, okay? - That would be great. - Mom, mom, mom, mom, dad's coming home. It was on the radio, and Mr. Cavanaugh said he'd take us down to the train. - I know honey, I heard it, too. - But Dad's coming home and. . . - Michael, I don't want you to get your hopes up too high. We haven't heard anything official. - But Mr. Cavanaugh said if I keep praying and asking, my prayers would be answered. - I know, Michael. But I don't want you to be disappointed. - Becky, Becky, did you hear about Dad? (sighs) - Merry Christmas, good night. - Jenny, what are you doing here, it’s Christmas Eve. Michael went home hours ago, he was so excited. - That’s why I’m here, Mr. Cavanaugh. - Well, I don’t understand, Jenny. - I don’t want Michael and Becky to be disappointed. And I don’t want you to fill Michael’s head with too much. . . - Hope? Listen, Jenny, I, uh, I lost a son in the war at Normandy, and there was never any hope. But now I believe in hope, because of Michael. And I want Michael to believe in hope. We must never deny him that. I mean, isn’t that what this season is all about? The hope of peace, goodwill among men, huh? Now I am going to give you a lift home. You’ve got a big day tomorrow. ♫ Away in a manger ♫ No crib for his bed ♫ The little Lord Jesus ♫ lay down his sweet head ♫ The stars in the sky ♫ Looked down where he lay ♫ The little Lord Jesus ♫ asleep on the hay ♫ The cattle are lowing ♫ The poor baby wakes ♫ But little Lord Jesus ♫ No crying he makes ♫ I love thee, Lord Jesus ♫ - Good night, sweetie, Merry Christmas. - Night, Mommy. - Good night, sweetie. - Good night. - Sleep tight. - I will. - Good night. - Good night.

(train bell clanking) - He heard me, he heard me. - Michael. - Michael? - You’re home. - Phillip! - Jen, Jen! - I knew you’d come home. (train whistle blowing) - There’s a cinnamon roll missing. (laughter) - Who took the cinnamon roll? - Michael. - Michael. - I was hungry. - He was hungry. - Well, I was hungry too. To tell the truth, I took the cinnamon roll. (glass clanking) Shall we? - Yes. - Let’s give thanks. (Door bell chimes) I wonder who that is? - Excuse me, sir, but there’s a young man here. - Well bring him in, Mildred, bring him in. Well, come in Butch, come in. - Your dad’s gonna be needing these. - Thanks, Butch. - I’m glad you’re home. - Thank you. - Butch, have you eaten? - Well, kinda. - Oh, kinda isn't good enough. Mildred, bring this young man a chair. And Mildred, I think we'll need one more plate, (laughter) unless you don't want to eat. (laughter and chatter) - [Becky] Look, it's snowing. - [Mr. Cavanaugh] Oh, it looks like it's going to be a white Christmas after all. - [Mrs. Grant] Merry Christmas, everybody. - [Everyone] Merry Christmas. - [Mr. Cavanaugh] Merry Christmas, Butch.
