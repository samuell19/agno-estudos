Potatoes! Onions! Hush! What? Shit! Open the damn door! Open it! Open the door! Hide! Open the door. Open the door, boy. Open it! Calm down, please! I’m going to fuck you up. POLICE Please, don’t do it. Step aside. Move! Hey! Please! Bastard. Don’t! Fuck… Go! -Kiai! -I want to hear it! Louder! Not good. Go back to your places. Man up! Go! -Kiai! -Louder! Louder! Go back to your places! Go! -Kiai! -I want it louder! I can’t hear your kiai! Go back! Man up! Again! Shut your bitch ass up. You don’t know how to play… If we scored 15 points, it would be legendary. Neslihan! Ayşe? These are all I could find. -It’ll get infected, Ayşe. It won’t work. -Let’s just bandage it. God, you are so stubborn. Does it hurt? I need a place to sleep tonight. Can you put your weight on it? -Can I stay at your place? -Like I said, Murat is home. I’ll leave early in the morning, Neslihan. What am I going to tell Murat? How would I know? Look at the state I’m in, Neslihan! What should I do? Where should I go? I need to hide. I don’t have any money. Here, this is all I have. Take it, Ayşe. What am I going to do? -What am I going to do? -Shh… Don’t, Ayşe. Don’t. Oh, Ayşe… We told you this would happen. You dug a hole for yourself and others. Let’s get out of here. -Where will you go? -I don’t know. -You never saw me, okay? -Okay, but where will you go? If anyone asks, you never saw me, Neslihan. Okay? Ayşe, you know I’m trying to help you, right? -Okay, never mind. -Keep me updated. You knew it would happen. Remember what happened when you wanted a divorce? You have to bear it like everyone else. Neriman ran far away, they still got her and shot her in the forehead. It’s about honor. You can’t escape it. Sister Hatice, please! I have nowhere to go! I won’t say it again, Ayşe. Don’t come here. He’ll come after you with his brothers and cousins. He’ll crush whoever stands in his way. Don’t get me in trouble. What am I supposed to do? Where should I go? I don’t have another choice. I’m coming to Istanbul. -Stay away from us. I don’t give a shit! -Sister? Sister Hatice? ÖZKAN CO. -Brother? -What are you doing here? Why are you here? You were supposed to be in Germany. -What are you doing here? -Nothing. I’m leaving. -Where you going? -Go to bed. Where are you going, huh? Hey! Ahmet! Hurry up! What are you waiting for? Run! Ayşe! With the gas, the total is 206.50 liras. -Don’t you have change? -No. Fuck… TRAFFIC POLICE -Hello. -License and registration, please. -Is there a problem? -You don’t have a front plate. -And your license? -Um, I forgot my wallet at home. -No ID, then? -It’s in my wallet, too. You know you’ll be fined for not having a license, right? -I do. -What is your full name? Ayşe Emine Soluk. -This isn’t your car? -It’s my father’s. Hm… Okay, please wait in the car. If I need to pay a fine, I will. Fuck… ÖZKAN CO. Ayşe Emine Soluk. -Yes? -Hand over your keys. -Why? -We take the keys in such situations. -What situation? -Hand over your keys. Come on. Okay. Now follow me. -What is going on? -Nothing. Gosh, just follow me. Come on. So, where are you going? -Istanbul. -All the way to Istanbul… You have a long road ahead. Why are you going to Istanbul? I’ll just visit my relatives and all. Good. What are we waiting for, exactly? You don’t have your ID or your license. My colleagues are looking into it. We’ll see what we need to do. I know my ID number. Can’t I just tell you? No, we can’t do that. We have asked the station if the car is stolen, or if you are a terrorist. They will look into it, investigate it and give us confirmation. Water? No, thanks. Hello? Yes. Yes, wait a second. Yes. Okay. Listen, girl. Here is my advice: Make up with your father. It seems you really pissed him off. I know about these problems. I’m a father, too. And I had a father, too. I was also young once. At your age, you might think you are being rebellious… but you’ll feel sorry as you get older. You’ll regret it. Just listen to my advice and ask for his forgiveness. And you are a daughter. Girls are different. They are not like boys. They are more delicate. You dote on your daughter. You coddle her. Listen, girl. I’m a cop. We always find dead girls who are just like you. -Brother Osman sends his regards. -Thanks. Ayşe! Where are you going? Fuck your damn car! Can’t it go any faster? Faster. Slow down. -You can’t see anything. -Shut up or I’ll fuck you up. Hush. Take it! Do I need to find your money, too? What? We’re the police. Keep going. Don’t fucking look, or I’ll fuck you up! What are you looking at? Come here. Have you ever seen one of these? -What is your name? -Engin. Engin… Do you know how to use it? -Yes. -Okay, good. This is your honor. Come on, boy! Brother Çetin! Wait, Brother Çetin! Oh, shit! -What are we doing? -Hush. -I fucked up my foot. -Shut up. Brother Çetin! Brother Çetin! Hush. Don’t make a sound. All right? Hush. You piece of shit, didn’t I just give you the gun? -What do you mean you dropped it? -I just did. Really? I told you it was your honor. Do you want to get fucked in these woods now? You retard. -Why couldn’t you find the gun he dropped? -He was running from a boar, so… What’s he doing in the woods if he’s scared of boars? Stop staring! Fucking dimwits! Rocky? Rocky? Wait up! We don’t even know what we are doing. -We can’t see shit. -We really can’t, Brother Sedat. Stop, for God’s sake. I can’t walk anymore. Brother Sedat! -Get up, you are whining like a bitch! -Don’t. Stop! -Get up, boy! -My foot is fucked. Don’t. Stop! Sit down for a minute. Calm down. Let’s talk. I can’t walk, see? Çetin, go and collect some wood with Engin to make fire. Are you fucking with me? Are we having a picnic here? Huh? -Fire? She is running away. -She can’t run away without food or water. -You don’t care because we got the money? -What do you mean? Let it go. She is gone. Gone? Gone where? Am I out on the road for nothing? I’ll fuck you up! If you kept tabs on your whore of a sister, none of this would happen. We aren’t in Germany! Learn from your father! -You should have kept tabs on her! -I will fuck your bitch ass up! I’ll fuck you up. I’m taking care of everyone. Could your dad found that company without me? I handled all the paperwork! I’m taking care of everyone! You have me to thank for the food in your house! I’ll fuck you up… -Fuck off! -What did you say? “Fuck off?” Do you know what I have been going through? Huh? “Fuck off?” Who do you think you’re talking to? I’ll fuck you up! I’ll fuck you up! I couldn’t keep tabs on her? Stand back! -Are you going to shoot me? -Don’t make me use it. You’re pulling a gun on me? Do you know what I’ve been through? I couldn’t keep tabs on her? I couldn’t keep tabs on her? I couldn’t keep tabs on her? I couldn’t keep tabs on her? I couldn’t keep tabs on her? I couldn’t keep tabs on her? Son of a bitch. I couldn’t keep tabs on her? Good job, my girl. You should have been a boy. Get up. Hello? We are in Tazı, Brother Osman. Hello? Brother Osman? My condolences. Ayşe killed Ahmet. Rocky! Get up! You bitch! Hold it. Engin! Hey! Stay here. Shout if anything happens! -Çetin? -Yes? -Give me a pill. -I don’t have any left. -Really? Just give me one. -I really don’t. Fuck off! Go ahead. This way! Fuck your damn pill. Ayşe! Is this what you want? Is it? You want to shoot me, too? I’m already dead. We are both dead, because of you. Huh? We both died because of you. You killed us both! Talk. Fucking talk! -Talk! -Shoot me, then! Go ahead! What are you waiting for, an apology? Be brave for once. You pulled the gun, now shoot me! Shoot me! -Shoot me, asshole! -Okay! I’m ready for everything in my pursuit. And I’m not? I’d rather die than be with you! And you will die. You’ll respect your husband. You’re keeping what is mine from me? -You give it to Fırat but not me? -You can’t hold a candle to him! -You can only fuck like this! Let me go! -You’ll see how I fuck! You are mine! Turn around! I’m going to fuck you! You are mine! Engin! Brother Çetin! Brother Çetin! Engin! I won’t die. I won’t die, you fucking whore. Brother Çetin! Shut the fuck up! Stop screaming like a bitch! They are just boars. All the animals heard us now. We won’t hunt shit because of you. -Where is Brother Sedat? -That bitch fucking killed him. But I’ll fuck that whore. You’ll see. Don’t be scared. Boars won’t hurt you! Take it. Here. Give it back. Fucking whore. Fuck. I thought it was Ayşe. Don’t be scared. These are boar piglets. They won’t hurt you. We can shoot and eat one of them. -They make a great stew. -Isn’t it a sin to eat pork? Are they the same thing? You can eat wild boars. When I was your age… I used to shoot wild boars and make necklaces out of their teeth. -Haven’t you ever hunted with Selahattin? -No. Haven’t you learned how to hunt wild boars? Nope. Look. You hunt wild boars in three ways. Not everyone knows about it. Only real men do. Waiting and driving are for pricks, okay? Real hunters scout and search. -Are you listening? -Yes. Are you listening, buddy? But you need to be quiet. And careful. That’s how we’ll hunt Ayşe. Like a boar. But be careful. If you look down like a cold dick, you won’t see shit. You are done, boy. You are my wingman now. We are going to hunt together, boy. Brother Çetin, let’s go back. Go back to fucking where? Don’t complain like Ahmet now. -It’s about to get dark. -Are you scared of dark, too, dickhead? -Why are you crying? -My feet hurt. Okay, sit down. Sit down and rest. Go on! Fuck this piece of shit phone. You can’t wear them if you take them off. Your feet will be swollen. Give me your phone. -What’s the password? -Four zeros. ÖZKAN CO. OSMAN ÖZKAN Hello, Brother Osman? I don’t have good news. Fuck! Hide, quick! Leave the backpack, or I’ll fuck you up! Ayşe! You are about to eat my dick, Ayşe! I have some dick stew! Leave the damn backpack! -I’m sure you’ll like it, Ayşe! -I’ll fuck you all up. Some hot dick stew, Ayşe! You fucking whore! You are fucked now. You are fucked, Ayşe. I’m going to fuck you. Engin! Engin! Get up. Get the fuck up! Turn around. -Where is Ahmet? -He is dead. -Who killed him? Sedat? -Yes. -Sister, please… -Shut up! I’m not your sister! Are you one of Sedat’s relatives? Give me a damn answer! -What? -I’m Çetin’s cousin. How old are you? Sixteen. Do you know why Çetin brought you here? Because you are young, you’ll get a lighter sentence. If they got caught, you’d be the scapegoat. Got it? You didn’t get shit. Do you know what they’ll do to you in prison? They will fuck you. Get up! Get up! Turn around. -Are you going to follow me? Huh? -Don’t go, sister. The boars will eat me! I’m not your sister! If you follow me, I’ll fuck you up before the boars do! Engin? Sister, do buses to Istanbul pass through here? You missed one. There is one more before dawn. -Do they sell bus tickets here? -I don’t know, dear. CAR WASH Excuse me. Hey! -How can I go to Istanbul? -How would I know? I mean, is there a ticket vendor around here? Could you leave? We don’t sell tickets. -Can I use your Wi-Fi for two minutes? -Get out. We don’t have Wi-Fi. -You’re using it! -Don’t touch it! Leave! You’re here at night all alone, woman! Get out of my face. Don’t piss me off! Hakkı, start the generator! Hakkı, the generator! Come here! Okay! What happened, miss? Are you looking for someone? -Is this bus going to Istanbul? -Yes. Why? -You’ve been looking at us. Why? -Is there an empty seat? An empty seat? For what? I’m trying to go to Istanbul. I’m in a dire strait. I came all the way here. I have money, but they don’t sell tickets here. Could you find me a seat? -There are no seats, the bus is full. -Wait! How about I give you the ticket fee and you find me a seat? -There are no seats. -How much is it? I can pay you 200 liras. -I’m telling you, there are no seats! -How about 300? 400? Huh? Show me the money. -Will you help me? -Show it to me. Give me. Give me the money. -Will you take me? -Give it to me. Come on! I’m not a fucking thief. Wait over there. Come over here. Listen to me carefully. After the announcement, people will take their seats. You’ll go in through the last door and take the first empty seat on the left. The first empty seat, okay? But after everyone takes their seats. -I’ll give you a sign. Wait for me, okay? -Okay. Okay? Good. -There won’t be a problem, right? -There won’t be a problem. Go in. Gosh… We can go! -What the fuck kind of seating is this? -Please, sir. -Don’t swear. Wait a second. -What is this? I won’t sit with a woman! -Can I see your ticket, please? -What ticket? I paid you. Paid me what? She doesn’t have a ticket. Stop the bus! -Get off. You are a stowaway. -What? -Get off. Come on! -Why do I have to get off? -You paid me? Get out! -I paid you! -Why do I have to get off? -Open the door! Get out! -Give my money back! -Get out! We can go now! Fucking idiot! Where did I go wrong? What did I do to deserve a whore like you? You think you can disrupt a decades-old system? You slut! You slept around. You whore, you fucked up… You ended our family line. Get up! Get up! -Dad, let me go! Please! -I’m going to fuck you up! You ended our family line! Sit the fuck down! I’m her father! -Stop! Don’t move, or I’ll fuck you up! -Run away! She has a gun! Run! -Put the gun down! -Stand back! Run! -No, stop! -Call the police! -Stop! Stand back! -She is going to shoot the kid! -Let the kid go! -Drop the gun! Drop it! -Call the gendarmerie! -Please, stop! -Let the kid go! Shoot her! -You whore! Shoot her down! Enough! I’m going to fucking kill you all! -Help me! -Put the gun down! Let him go! Put your gun down! I swear I’ll shoot you! Put it down! Drop it!
