Dybbuk was shot in 1937 by Michal Wasynski for the Feniks company in Warsaw. The original duration of the film was of 125 minutes, but only a short 90-minutes version of it came out in France on the 18th of May 1938. The present restoration comes from a nitrate copy of that short version, kept in the collections of the Cin?matheque Francaise, and from a full-length positive prim of the Tel-Aviv cinematheque, captioned in Hebrew, and kept at the cinematheque of Jerusalem. This would not have been possible without the help of these three institutions, and the "Fondation pour la M?moire de la Shoah", and especially the help of the "Association des Amis de la Commission Centrale de l'Enfance" which we sincerely thank, as well as the friendly complicity of Elizabeth Lenchener. The restoration work was fully conducted at the Lobster Films laboratories (2016). The extremely damaged soundtrack was restored at the L.E. DIAPASON laboratories.

When a man dies before his time, his soul returns to the Earth so that it may complete the deeds it had left undone, and experience the joys and griefs it had not lived through... Hey mister, you from these parts? No, I'm from Brinitz. - Why are you pushing? - Why are you pushing? My master, Reb Sender is sitting up front and I can't even take a peek. Oh, leave me alone! A man must see where he's going. How can I see? My eyes haven't yet been opened. Once a year, at a certain hour, these four supreme sanctities of the world were united. This was on Yom Kippur when the High Priest entered the Holy of Holies and there uttered the name of God. This being the holiest hour was also one of great peril to the High Priest and to all of Israel. For had a sinful thought entered the mind of the Priest, the entire world would have been destroyed. Human souls, through great anguish and pain, and through many incarnations strive to reach the heights, their Source, the Throne of Glory. But sometimes, even after a soul reaches exalted heights, evil suddenly overwhelms it and the soul stumbles and falls. Now's the time. Tell the Rebbe. Just me? I'm afraid... We'll do it together then. Rebbe... Sender? Nisn? What is it? You have something to tell me? Yes Rebbe. - We wanted to tell you... - Good holiday to you! I've come from Gelopole to Miropole with a bottle of Hungarian wine for the Wonder Rebbe. From Gelopol? So far? And on foot? I am a messenger after all. Rebbe, we have something to tell you. The two of us are friends. - I know. - We studied in the same yeshiva... - Yes, I know. - We were married in the same week. I know... Now, we're cut off from each other. Nisn lives far away. We meet only here, on the holidays. So we decided. Decided? Man does not make decisions, my children. Mikhoel! - My black gabardine. - Right away, Rebbe. Nisn, now is the time. I wanted to tell you, Rebbe... Later Nisn! Now I should like to hear a song. Sing me your Song of Songs Why won't you sing at the Rebbe's request? The Song of Songs, by Solomon, Oh, give me of the kisses of your mouth. For your love is more delightful than wine For your love is more delightful than wine Your ointments yield a sweet fragrance. Your name is like the finest oil. Therefore do maidens love you. Therefore do maidens love you. The Song of Songs, by Solomon. Mikhoel, it's time to go. The Rebbe still hasn't learned of our vow. Man never knows when it is a time for rejoicing and when... A time for sorrow. Curse this bad luck! Never mind. We'll still have a chance lo tell him. Tomorrow is Hoshana Rabba, a lucky day. The Heavens are the Heavens of the Lord but the Earth He has given to mankind. Dead men cannot praise the Lord nor those who sink into silence. But we will bless the Lord from now and forevermore. Halleluyah! Now's the time! Let's tell him about our vow. You distemper the prayer! For the establishment of Your Residence... Give us Salvation! HOSHANA ! Hoshana! In favour of your house of peace, Give us salvation! In favour of Your tabernacle in Jerusalem We'll tell the Rebbe right after the prayers. - Yes. - What is it you want to tell the Rebbe? Nisn and I have taken a vow. Since both our wives are expecting, if one gives birth to a boy and the other... To a girl, we'll marry them off. What an idea! Jews! Where tribes come on pilgrimage, Such things are not done without deliberation. You cannot pledge something as yet unborn. The angular stone, so precious Well, it's alright! Without faith we Jews would be in a bad way. Zion, city of excellence In favor of the Saint of Saints Then my mission here has ended. Where thy love shall preside, Where thy splendor shall reside, On top of the fortress, HOSHANA! Safe journey Nisn! Let me know if it's a boy or a girl. Goodbye, Sender! Get rich and prepare the dowry! Don't forget... A boy or a girl! Mazal tov, master Sender! Happiness to you, my Senderke! It's a girl!A little beauty! Frayd?, dear sister, a girl? Yes, Senderk?, it's a girl, but... Why so sad? - How's the mother? - Oh, dear brother... Why are you so quiet, Frayd?, my dear sister? What's happened? My Khan?l?? Khan?l?l! In giving life, she gave away her own life. That is the way it goes. One enters the world, while another leaves it. How much longer? Who knows? We'll sooner reach God than the shore. - Couldn't you wait? - No... My wife is expecting. Who is crying? Nisn! Nisn! Oh, my dear husband! Blessed art thou, Lord our God, whose might fills the world. Sender! Remember the vow! Nisn! Nisn! Sender! I could have sworn someone called my name. Mazel tov! A son! Since the Count of Brinnits is so interested in my land, why shouldn't I be well paid? All right. 5,000 more. No, I want 10,000. 5,000, and not a penny more! In that case, no deal! Wait! Count the money. Frayde, try to pacify her. I might miscount the money. Hush, my darling. Daddy's counting money. After ten years, that makes... Daddy, let me count the money too. Leyele, please don't bother me. I might make a mistake! So, after 18 years I've earned... Father, I have something to tell you. Not now, Leyele. Can't you see I'm busy counting money? Leyele, Go to bed... Reb Sender, haven't you counted enough? Big deal. It jingles. Show some respect for your master and his money. Go harness the horses. Hurry. You're on your way to Brinnits. I wanted to arrive before the Sabbath... Then you must hurry. You have a long road ahead. Good grief! You nearly ran the boy over! There is an even greater danger. The Sabbath may overtake him on the road. Sir, take him with you. You must be headed for the yeshiva in Brinnits. - Yes. - Then have a seat. I'll take you there! How about you? I go on foot. Such is my custom. Now everything will happen in due course. Because you have given us Thou Holy Rest You forgive the good, Lord, by sanctifying the Shabbat. Amen! Drink up! My wine cellar won't run dry! I'm coming, I'm bringing... Here comes Note with the carp. This is not a carp! It's a whale! Are you in partnership with Elijah the Prophet? With Elijah? Never! He takes credit for all the miracles himself. So, Honk'? you've given up on Talmud and turned to Kabbalah instead ... Why? The Talmud is cold and dry. So are the commentaries. But the Kabbalah... pulls the soul free of the earth. It uplifts man into the highest spheres. There is a great danger reaching such heights, for one can easily fall into the abyss. I shall not fall. I have a path of my own, that will lead me to my... Goal. Our sages said: Jerusalem was destroyed because they did not heed the laws of the Sabbath. The Sages also said that If Israel had correctly respected the Shabbat... Do you have brothers or sisters? No. I, too, am an only child. I never knew my father. He was drowned in a river during a storm, on the day I was born. My mother also died on the day of my birth. I must be off. Please don't go! When father wakes up, he'll want to talk to you some more. I feel as if we've known each other for so long. - Don't you? - So do I. Everyone's asleep and here we are talking... - Maybe it's a sin. - A sin? Why's that? I'll go now. Father's talking in his sleep. Dream and reality. Two worlds. My father's name was also Nisn. I meant to ask you... - Good Sabbath! - Good Sabbath! Good Sabbath! I meant to ask you, where will you spend the night? In the synagogue, of course. Aren't you afraid? Aunt Frayde says that the dead pray there at night. A grave in the middle of the street? Yes. Don't you know? It's a holy grave. Saturday night, the whole town walks by here. HERE LIE BRIDE AND GROOM HOLY AND PURE MARTYRED FOR THEIR FAITH IN THE YEAR 1648. Are you reading the inscription? Yes. A bride and a groom who died as martyrs... When the murderer Khmelnitsky attacked our town, he killed a bride and a groom as they stood under the canopy. They were buried right here, where it happened. In the same grave? It has long been our custom to dance around the grave after a wedding to cheer the buried couple. A noble custom! Here lie buried the holy and pure groom... And bride. I'm a drayman with two fine steeds. I've no fear of wind or snow. So long as the wagon's got its wheels, no need to worry, though there's far to go. Giddyup horsies! Giddyup and neigh! Waitin' for you back home, back home, is a bale full of hay. Hue! Pfouh! I'm telling you, Sender, you'll not find a better match than the one from Klimovka. How about the boy himself? A fine specimen! I'll think about it. What's the rush? What's there to think about? Look how your daughter has grown! Wait... Maybe you've got your eye on that fellow who takes his meals at your house? Who? Khon'ke? - Are you mad? - Why not? I've heard rumors. After the Sabbath, we'll go to Klimovka to see that bridegroom. Now you're talking! Good luck to you, then. Well, look who's here. Good morning, Reb Sender! Good morning, Khonnon! Listen, I want your advice about something. I've just been talking to Zalmen about Leah. He has a good match for Leah, but I can't seem to decide. Reb Sender... Of course, Reb Sender's son-in-law must be wealthy for my child to have a good life. What do you think, Khonnon? What can I think? Khonnon? Are you off to the ritual bath again? - Yes. - Are you still fasting from Sabbath to Sabbath? It is harder for me to eat on the Sabbath than to fast all week. What is it you want? I want... To reach a clear and sparkling diamond, dissolve it in tears and absorb it into my soul. I want... Yes... I must get... Two barrels of gold coins for him who can count only coins. Look out! Look out, Khonnon, you're on a treacherous path. You will not attain all this by holy means. And if not by holy means, what then? I'm afraid to talk to you. I'm afraid to stand near you. Jews! Over there in the ritual bath... A student, Khonnon, is calling out to Satan! Satan can be summoned only by that great doubly-spoken Name that fuses in its flame the highest peaks with the deepest valleys. - Isn't it terribly dangerous? - Yes. In the great yearning of the spark of a flame the vessel could burst. Shouldn't he be warned? No. Let each man follow his own road. Noute! I'm coming! - The horses are harnessed. - Then let's be off. Just a minute. Khonnon! Khonnon! Here... Say the blessing and drink. How do you know I'm thirsty? How could I know of course? I only wanted to wait on a scholar. An extra good deed for the road is like an extra horseshoe. Go on, drink. Blessed art thou by whose word all things come into being. Amen! To your health. Sender, we're off. Well, let's go. Goodbye, daughter. Be well, sister. - Have a safe journey! - Good luck! May this hour be good and favourable! - Good day. - Good day. Father didn't even tell me where he's going. He must have forgotten in the rush. It's not a secret. He went to Klimovka to decide on a bridegroom for you. A bridegroom? Leyele! Leyele! God help you! Leyele, what's wrong? Khonnon! Khonnon! Help! Into the bedroom! Water! Leah. Woe is me... Leyele, thank God. Where is Khonnon? Why do you need him? Please, call him in, Aunty. Khonnon left. He left? Khonnon! Khonnon! Gone? Gone... Oh Aunty... I don't understand! We've been bargaining all day and you're still dissatisfied. The groom's father agreed to all your conditions. No, not at all. I want him to support them for 10 years. - I'll agree to 5. - I insist on 10. - I say 5. - Then it's no use. - I can't stand a die-hard. - Sender, don't be so rash. What is it? The bride's father will be coming in to test you. Rebbe, I'm so afraid! When you study, you're not afraid! Well! There, they say... There, they say... Unless there has been... Now what? I'm afraid of strangers. I'm terrified when they look at me. Nothing frightens me so much as the look of strangers. I'll charm the evil eye away from you. On empty fields and forests... For me and you. There's no need for a charm. The match is off! He's leaving? Thank God! 'There's a wagon in the forest And the land's in bloom. With her face to the wall, A girl is sifting in her room. "Tell me Maiden, your desire. What's the reason for your tears? The one who has departed Shall return no more, I fear." Khon'k?! Where are you coming from? We went to look for a bridegroom for Leyele. The match fell through. - Really? - Why? What's it to you? Do you want to marry into the family? Me? No.. But where's Reb Sender? We rich people do things our own way. The match, you understand, didn't go through, but the fathers made a deal over oxen instead. Khonnon... Khonnon... You should have seen those beauties! I have won! Khonnon, what do you mean? All those spells, All that harrowing of the flesh, all the fasts... I have won again! Now, all I need are the two barrels of gold. Sinful words! Khonnon, you're playing into Satan's hands! So what? In every sin there is holiness. Holiness in sin? How is that possible? All of God's creation has within it a spark of holiness. Sin is the creation of Satan, not of God. And who created Satan? God! The Other Side of God must be holy too. Be quiet! They'll hear you! Look! Reb Senders daughter. Leyele! You promised to show her the curtains for the Ark. With the greatest pleasure! Which sin is the most powerful of all ? The hardest to conquer? Is it not the sin of lust for a woman? - Isn't it? - Yes. And if this sin is cleansed in a great flame, the greatest uncleanliness turns to highest holiness. To the Song of Songs. The Song of Songs 'by Solomon.. Oh, give me of the kisses of your mouth. For your love is more delightful than wine. For your love is more delightful Than wine. .. Your ointment yields a sweet fragrance. Your name is like finest oil. Therefore do maidens love you. Therefore do maidens love you. The Song of Songs 'by Solomon.. Come Leyele. Come quickly Leyele. 'By Solomon.. The Song of Songs. 'By Solomon.. Who taught you that? Khonnon. Khonnon? Where did he learn it? - It's his father's melody. - His father's? Impossible. That melody was once sung by my friend Nisn. But he drowned years ago. His father was also called Nisn. He, too, was drowned. Woe is me! Mazel-tov, Sender! The whole town is buzzing with the news. The in-laws are coming. Whose in-laws? They're coming! They agreed to 10 years room and board! 10 years! 10 years! She's bashful, poor child. Nisn... Dear friend, it's too late now. Too late... And Who separates day from night... Jews! Students! It's time for a toast and a celebration! Reb Sender's daughter is engaged! Let's go, let's go! Three times he came back empty-handed. Engaged? How can that be? One... two... three... four... five... six... seven... eight... nine... Nine scrolls. The numerical value of the letters T-R-U-T-H Thirty-six is twice... the living... Thirty-six handles on the scrolls... Thirty-six equals L-E-A-H. Three times thirty-six is K-H-O-N-N-O-N. Leah also spells Lo Hashem: not God. If not through God, then how? Through Satan! Satan, I implore you! Help me! Come, take my body, my soul, my wisdom. Take my learning. All I ask in return is the maiden Leah bas Khane. I see the secret of the doubly spoken Name. I...See it! I have won again! What do you want mister? I must see Reb Sender. Is it you again? I have been sent here. Jews! Khonnon! Where is he? Invite him here to dance with us. Khonnon is dead. Charity saves from death... Charity saves from death... He was a yeshiva student. Ate his meals at Reb Sender's. Who could have known he kept company with demons! He should be buried among the outcasts. Charity saves from death! Enough. It's time to recite the mourner's Kaddish. Well? Henakh, recite the Kaddish. - I'm afraid... - Let Meir recite it. Why me? There must be someone best placed to do it. Let me... In my simple way. No, Noute. I should be the one to recite the Kaddish for my Khonnon. May His Great Name be magnified and sanctified In the world he hath created to His will, May He establish His Kingdom and may His salvation sprout and His Messiah come. In your life and your days in the life of all the home of Israel. May His Great Name be magnified and sanctified In the world he hath created to His will, May He establish His Kingdom and may His salvation sprout in the life of all the house of Israel. In the near future. Come on Leyele. When you leave a graveside, you mustn't look back. I want to remember the place. A weeping willow. Come on, now. Sender the wealthy invites all the poor, and bids them come to his granary door. Hurry, you poor folk, with open palms, for each, ten groschen of Reb Sender's alms. May the hour be good and favourable! - Oh, how beautiful you are! - How does it feel to be a bride? A blessing on your head! Amen! Go child, to your mother's grave. Shed all your tears there, and invite her to the wedding. Tell her that I want her to accompany me in leading my child to the canopy. Tell her I kept my promise, to raise you as an honest and pious Jewish girl. Now, I've provided you with a husband, a learned, God-fearing husband, a... Come, Leyele... What's keeping you? Auntie, at the graveyard, may I invite someone who isn't related? Why do you ask? - In my dreams, I saw... - Who? Khonnon. What? He asked me to invite him to the wedding. - Who? - Khonnon. Oh child... I'm so afraid. They say he died an unnatural death. Auntie ... Don't cry, my darling. Don't cry little dove. Don't cry. All right. Invite him. This once I'll take the sin upon myself. Come, darling. What a beautiful bride! Empty pail? May the bad luck be cast into the wilds. Go away! Go on, Leyele. I'll wait here at aunt Mirele's grave. But hurry, we must return soon. Stop pushing! There's enough to go around! For everyone! For everyone! - He ripped my caftan! - It's going to bring you bad luck! - Here, for your caftan! - Thank you, generous master! Someone was gifted twice! You've doled out enough to make their day. Here rests the commendable young man, worthy scholar, Elkhonnon Ben Nisn deceased on 18 lyar 5596 (spring 1836) May his soul be bound to the bouquet of eternal Life. Knonnon, my bridegroom, come dance at my wedding. Bride! If the bride is left alone before the wedding, demons come and carry her off. There are no demons, but souls of people whose light went out too early and forever. Not forever. The souls of the dead return to the world and wander about before they receive purification. Sinful souls are transformed into beasts, fishes and plants. And there are souls that enter a living body of one whom they once loved. This is a dybbuk. A dybbuk? Come my bridegroom. I'll carry our souls and those of our unborn children. Bayu, bayu, my babies, without clothes, without a bed, unborn children, never mine, lost forever, lost in time. Khonnon! Leye! Leyele! Leyele! Leyele! Leyele! Leyele! Where are you? You must not leave a bride alone in the graveyard. To honor this first meeting of the parents on both sides, let the band strike up a tune for the royal groom and bride! The groom's party has arrived. They're asking for you. Why are you so pale? Look! Your gown is creased... And stained... Go! Go! Leave! Ley-ye... If you leave a bride alone before the wedding, demons come... What took you so long? Come Leyele! Dance with the poor. It's a worthy custom. Go, Leyele. Go bring joy to the poor. It's a most worthy deed. I want to dance with the bride! For my aunt Etk?, I have to dance! It's the same every time! Why is it coming back to you? Why? Dance with me! I haven't danced for 40 years! Let's get into the swirl! More! You've danced enough. You'll get dizzy. Want a drink? A man must see what he's doing. My eyes haven't yet been opened. Please leave these parts! Man is born out of dust and unto dust he returns. In a world of vain pursuits he sojourns. To what ends are your ambitions and pains, when there is only the grave to welcome your remains. Prayer and beseeching are of no avail. For in the end, death must prevail. All mirth is mixed with dread. For man's life is like a dance of the dead. I'm afraid. Remember, right after the meal, the wedding bard calls out: "The bridegroom will deliver his oration." - Then you stand up and... - But Rebbe, I'm afraid! Of what? Did you forget your speech? No. I didn't. But I'm terrified... All those strange people! About to be married and afraid of shadows! Rebbe, I feel as though I were being led to the gallows! See here! They feed the guests marzipan and we get bits of khale! He's so rich! He could have given each of us a whole loaf! What's the difference? When we die, the worms get it all. Look! The wedding bard! Do not tremble child, do not be afraid. 'You are guarded by a watch' 'of sixty warriors brave.. Sixty warriors with swords protect you from misfortune. You'll be led to the canopy. Blessed will that hour be. Your mother, virtuous and wise, walks forth from the Paradise. From the Paradise.. On her robes, gold and silver Two angels come to greet her 'Yes, to his encounter' They stand on either side, to the left and to the right. ?Khanele mine, Khanele fine, why on your gown do gold and silver shine?' And Khanele answers them thus and so: "My joy is great. Why should my gown not glow?' My only child, the crown of my head, is this day to the canopy led.? ?Khanele mine, Khanele fine, then why is there pain in those eyes of thine?? And Khanele answers thus and so: "Should my heart not grieve, should it not feel woe? Strangers to the wedding lead the bride, while I in sadness stand on a side.' Soon to the canopy they will lead her. Young and old will come to greet her. Elijah will come and take the great goblet in hand, and recite a blessing for the entire land. Amen and Amen.. 'He who is supremely mighty,' 'He who is supremely blessed.. He who is supremely sublime, He who is supremely joyful. May He bless the groom and the bride. He who is supremely mighty,' 'He who is supremely blessed.. He who is supremely sublime, He who is supremely joyful May he bless the groom and the bride. You exempt the good, O eternal, King of the Universe Who creates the fruit from the vines AMEN! You exempt the good, O Eternal, King of the Universe, Who sanctified us by his commandments and ordered us to cohabitate, 'Who instructed us to be engaged,' Who taught us to get married By the nuptial canopy and the consecration. You exempt the good, O Eternal, Who sanctifies the people of Israel By the nuptial canopy and the consecration AMEN! Bridegroom, drink the wine without a blessing. Bride, drink without a blessing. Repeat after me: - With this ring, - With this ring, No! You are not my bridegroom! Leyele! Holy bride and groom, protect me! Leyele! You buried me but I have come back to my destined bride and will not leave her... The bride has been possessed by a dybbuk! How much longer before the Rebbe will see us? He will see you shortly. Reb Israel of Ruzhin bore himself like a king. He used to travel with ten horses in tandem. Welcome, Reb Sender. - It's Reb Sender of Brinnits - I'll take you right in to see the Rebbe. Here's the Rebbe! The Rebbe! The Rebbe! The man tells wondrous tales. Tell us another! The Rebbe won't be out so soon. I will tell you... I will tell you a parable. I will tell you a parable told by my Rebbe. A wealthy man, a great mister, once came to see the Rebbe. The Rebbe led the man to the window and said: "Look!" The wealthy man looked through the window. And the Rebbe asked: "What do you see?" What do you see? I see people. "Look again and tell me what you see now." What do you see now? Now, I see myself. Do you understand? A window and a mirror are both made of glass. But the glass of the mirror is covered with silver. And owing to the silver, man no longer sees others, and he sees only himself. Do you mean me? Oh, woe is me! Leyle! What's the matter Leyele? Leyele! Rebbe! Rebb Sender of Brinnits is here to see you. Sender of Brinnits? I know... A great misfortune has befallen him. His daughter is possessed by a dybbuk, God have mercy on us! Possessed by a dybbuk. I know... He brought her to you. To me... To me! How could he bring her to me, when the "I" in me is not here. Rebbe... All the world comes to you... All the world... It's a blind world... Blind sheep following a blind shepherd. If they were not blind, they would not come to me, but to "Him", who can say "I", the only "I" in the world. Rebbe, Sender of Brinnits. Send him in. Rebbe. Rebbe! Help me! How did the misfortune occur? - Immediately after the ceremony... - That's not what I'm asking. What caused the misfortune? A worm can enter a fruit only when it begins to rot. Rebbe, my child is a virtuous God-fearing Jewish daughter. Has the dybbuk been asked who he is? By his voice, he was recognized as a student of our yeshiva. You knew him? Yes, he ate regularly at my house. Did you perhaps... Slight him? Or cause him grief in any way? Try to remember. I don't know. I don't remember. Rebbe, I'm only human after all! Bring in the maiden! Rebbe! I've sinned! Help me to repent! Don't despair. Bring in the maiden. - The Rebbe wants to see you. - Come, Leyele. Aunty, I'm afraid. What will they do to me? Don't be afraid, Leyele. Don't be afraid. The Rebbe won't harm you. The Rebbe can't harm you. Child, don't shame me before the Rebbe. - Go in, Leyele. - Go ahead. I want to go in... But I can't. Go ahead my child, go in. I will not go in! Leyele! Dear lord! Mister, get out of the way. The child is afraid of you! Move aside! Take the maiden to the other room. Sender! Rebbe, this is the sin that weighs so heavily upon me. I sinned against my old friend, Nisn. I broke our vow. I didn't know that the young man who ate regularly at our house was his son. Sender, what have you done to your best friend? Because of you Nisn Ben Rivke has no one to bear his name, no memory, no heir, no one to say a prayer for his soul. What can I do Rebbe? You'll have to answer to Nisn before a rabbinical court. A trial? With a dead man? You will have to accept the verdict of the court. Mikhoel, my staff! Take my staff, and go to the cemetery stop at the first grave, and say: "Blameless departed! Azriel, son of the great Tsaddik Reb Itchele of Miropole, asks your pardon for disturbing your rest, and bids you to inform the deceased Nisn Ben Rivke, that the rabbinical court of Miropole has summoned him to a trial this evening, at midnight. Blameless departed! Azriel, son of the Tsaddik Reb Itchele of Miropole, asks your pardon for disturbing your rest. And bids you, by the ways that you were given, to inform the deceased Nisn Ben Rivke... It's midnight already, and the Rebbe's not here yet. Who can know his ways? Rebbe... Now, let us go! Blameless deceased, Nisn Ben Rivke this court decrees that you may not step beyond the partition that has been assigned to you. He's here! - He's here! - He's here! - He's here! - He's here! This rabbinical court will now deliver its verdict: whereas it is not known whether at the time of the vow between Sender Ben Henye and Nisn Ben Rivke, their wives had given birth, whereas according to the Holy Torah, an agreement pertaining to a thing not yet created is not binding. We cannot conclude that Sender was obliged to fulfill the pledge. This court asks the deceased to forgive Sender. Blameless deceased, Nisn Ben Rivke, did you hear our verdict? Do you accept the verdict? Nisn Ben Rivke, the trial between you and Sender Ben Rivke is over. The deceased did not answer: "Amen". Nisn Ben Rivke did not accept the verdict. Even if it had been otherwise decided, in the worlds above, I would reverse the decision! Sender, send the swiftest horses for the bridegroom's party. The wedding will take place tomorrow. See that the bridegroom gets here on time. The bridegroom will get there on time. Rebbe! Rebbe! Is it morning already? It's morning, Rebbe. What do they want from me? I'm old... And I'm weak... My soul yearns for solitude. Yet the misery and anguish of the world reach out to me. Every plea pierces me as a needle does the flesh. I have no more strength... I cannot go on... Rebbe... I cannot go on... I cannot... Rebbe... You father, Reb Itchele, of blessed memory, your grandfather, the renowned scholar, Reb Velvele the Great, who was a pupil of Baal Shem... Rebbe... My forebears... My saintly father, to whom Elijah revealed himself three times, My uncle, Reb Meir Beir, who ascended to heaven during the "SheMa" prayer. My grandfather, Velvele the Great, who resurrected the dead... You know, Mikhoel, my grandfather, Reb Velvele used to exorcise a dybbuk without holy names or incantations: simply with a command. At times of need I turn to him, and he sustains me. Him... He will not forsake me now. - Mikhoel! - Rebbe... Open the synagogue, summon the community and bring in the dybbuk! What will you do, Rebbe? This recalcitrant spirit, I will excommunicate him. Loyal Jews, bow down and pray! Bow down and pray, loyal Jews! Creator of all things! Behold the sorrow of a maiden's soul writhing in pain. Holy scrolls, intercede for a young dove who was driven from a peaceful nest. Saintly mothers of Israel: Sarah, Rivke, Rachel and Leah, Plead with the almighty! That a young sapling not be torn out by the roots! Master of the Universe, when I will appear before thy heavenly throne, how will I answer to Leyele's mother when she asks: "What have you done with the orphan I left in your care?" "Why didn't you shield her from harm?" King of the Universe! It is my sin! My negligence! I will stop at nothing! I will split the heavens! I will not rest until the crown of my head is restored to me! Father, as soon as we left home, a great fear possessed me. - A great fear! - Bah! Dybbuk, you departed from our world, and you are forbidden to return until the ram's horn is sounded. I command you I command you to leave the body of Leah bas Khane. Rebbe of Miropole I know how powerful and invincible you are. But you cannot sway me! For me, every road is blocked, every gate is shut, I have nowhere to go. Do not torment me, Do not harass me... Wandering soul, I feel great pity for you. And I will try to release you from the destroying angels. But you must leave the body of this girl, Leave! I will not leave! Sacred congregation, do you give me the authority, in your name and with your power, to expel from the body of a Jewish maiden a spirit, who refuses to leave of his own free will? Rebbe, we give you the authority, in our name, and with our power, to expel from the body of a Jewish maiden a spirit, who refuses to leave of his own free will. Dybbuk! Soul of one who left our world! In the name of a sacred congregation of Jews, I, Azriel Ben Hadas, command you to leave the body of the maiden Leah bas Khan, If you do not obey, I will excommunicate you! I do not fear your oaths and excommunications! There is no more exalted height than my present refuge! Mikhoel, have everyone put on white robes, bring seven ram's horns, and prepare the excommunication. I can't let you in! No one?s allowed in! Let me in, Jewish friends! My Leyele is in there! My one and only Leyele! No one?s allowed in, go away! Rise up, O Lord, let thine enemies be dispersed and scattered before thee. Like smoke let them be dispersed, rebellious and stubborn spirit with the power of God Almighty in the name of this sacred congregation I, Azriel Ben Hadas, do sunder the last threads that bind you to the living world and to the body and soul of the maiden Leah bas Khane. Woe is me! And I excommunicate you from all of Israel. Tekiah! I can struggle no more... Do you submit? Recite the Kaddish for me. Sender, say the first Kaddish! May His Great Name be magnified and sanctified, In this world that was created according to his will May Thy kingdom come, May Thy salvation sprout and Thy Messiah come By the same authority by which I excommunicated you I now revoke that excommunication. Lord of the Universe, God of compassion and grace, behold the great anguish of this tortured and wandering soul. Avert thine eyes from its sins, and grant its eternal rest in thy palaces. - Amen! - AMEN! Sender! Sacred congregation, welcome the groom's party, Remove your white robes! Put away your prayer shawls. Faster, faster, hurry. Who sighs here so deeply? I do. Who are you? I have forgotten who I am. Only in your thoughts I can remember myself. Oh, my heart was drawn to you as to a bright star. On silent nights I wept for you. Why have you forsaken me again? Why? I departed from your body to return to your soul. Take my soul My bridegroom, my husband. Leyele! Leyele... Leyele... Blessed be the True Judge. THE END
