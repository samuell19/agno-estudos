"...the last rains came gently, "and they did not cut the scarred earth. "The plows crossed and recrossed the rivulet marks. "The last rains lifted the corn quickly "and scattered weed colonies and grass along the sides of the roads "so that the gray country "and the dark red country began to disappear..." You listened to the sermon today? Yes, sir. And? I don't know. I don't know? "I don't know," is not much of an answer, boy. Ah, pulled in nap time. I don't care much for the Reverend's rhetoric. In fact, I'm sure his papi, Reverend senior would be rolling in his grave for some of the utterings coming out of his mouth in the house of the Lord. But I think we both understand what he was basically getting at. I think so. You see, Oscar, there comes a time when a man's gotta step up, son. Not so much for himself, but for the betterment of others. You understand what I mean? And when that time comes, we as men, we have to be ready to oblige it. - It's a mighty fine meal, Jo. - Thank you. - Thanks, Mom. - You're welcome, honey. Oscar, you're gonna run this over to Loux? Josephine, do not be giving away what's ours. Augustus, those children won't eat otherwise. Take this to them and hurry home. Yeah. Come over here, boy. Don't be lagging. I don't want you catching whatever virus lingers in that house, all right? Yes, sir. It's open. - Hey, Oscar. - Hey. Hey, dove. What you got there? It's chop from my mum. - Loux, why don't you go crank up the stove? - All right. - Take your brother in there. - Amos. Boy. Did you not hear me? Get your ass in there and help your sister. - Get your ass in there! - Hey! Huh? Hey! You're a daft little fucker, ain't you? Oscar. Come here, boy. Why don't you do something for me now? I want you to tell that daddy of yours I don't need his givings. I don't need his nor your mom's backhanded charity. You understand me? Loux, cut the stove off, give the feast back to Oscar. - But, Dad... - Just do it, baby. You heard me. But... Do what I say. Here, take it back. Get the fuck out of my house. Go! Loux? Loux! Amos? - You okay? - Yeah. What happened? Come sit with me. Get in there. Mmm. You know I love you, right? - Will you love me? - Mmm-hmm. No one will ever hurt you. You getting to be real pretty, you know that? I didn't notice how much you've grown up. I couldn't stop him. You have to do something. What do you mean? There's nowhere else for us to go. You could live out here. No one telling you what to do. Can you hear them? They're in the wind. Their screams. They were here long before us. And they will be forever. It's okay. It's okay. I have been wanting to give you this. It was my mom's. My dad won't let me wear it. I want you to have it. Let me help you. Got another minor, Keryn. Look at you. You're just a baby. We're short-staffed tonight. That's fine. I'll take him to Six. Come on, boy. I got another one for you. Is that the boy who came in last night? Does that kid look like a murderer to you, Keryn? No, he doesn't. Says this one's from out near the marsh too. How is a kid gonna get a hundred miles away overnight? Think he's got accomplices? You think there's a conspiracy here? I don't know. They're all starting to look the same to me. I'll leave you to it. Boy. Go on. "Oscar, "Clean up after yourself and put the milk delivery away. We'll see you tonight. "Love, Mom." I'm Peaches. You hungry? Go ahead. Come on. Don't worry. Come on. Where are your parents? My mom died when I was three. I never knew my father. I have a place to live, people who look out for me. Now, the real question is where do you live? Watch your step. After you. Well, look who it is. Took her forever to get back. Thought she tried to run away again like last time. Fellas, this is Oscar. Oscar, this is my family of broken toys. Sway? Sway! Come in. No. No. No! No room for him. Sway, come on. He's got nowhere to go. Said no. God, will you please just take a look? I found him outside the station. Quit being so fucking lazy. Oh, listen to the lady. Now let me have a look at you. I'm gentle as a lamb's ear. His name is Oscar. Ah, I see. Do you know what your name means, boy? No. Oscar, uh, divine spear, champion warrior. You are a champion, aren't you? Huh? Noble. You've made decisions only a man should make, not a boy. Should be a natural. Billy. Uh... I know, I know. You know what, Neville? Not to come here. But I do understand, you know, you liking the ambience and all, so... - Neville. - What? Right. Well, it's about the new boy. All right. Well, you just bring him by the office. He has family. He ain't told me where he's from, but he's not from the city. So... You know, I mean, I was thinking that we don't have the room. You see, this is why I leave the selection process to Flan. If this was your show, we'd be running a goddamn petting zoo. I was just thinking that... Well, don't be thinking, Neville. It ain't what you do good, okay? Look... Do you want to meet him? - You brought him here? - Yeah, I did. Oh, Jesus Christ. What? I just... Well... All right, look, I'll go get him. Come here, come here. Come on. They treatin' you all right? - Go ahead, answer him. - Yes, sir. Good. You just keep your eyes open. Maybe you'll learn a thing or two. Okay, all right. Okay. Go on out. I like him. Oh, he stays. Goddamnit. Goddamnit! How's the ticker, Neville? Running like a Swiss watch. Billy. Go! You know what to do. And you? So what we provide here is an education. A way of life. Fit only for wolves. Sir... Oh, yeah, down there and... And me, I'm the headmaster, or the conductor. Bloop! Look around. What do you see? Simple-minded people. Cogs in the wheel. Television, magazines, billboards. Other people's dreams. They've been told how to look, think, feel. They've never had an original thought. You know what separates us from them? The gift of desperation. Cotton, count the money. Lollie, the stone. So... you think you got this in you? I think he does. Did anyone ask you? What you got here? Two hundred and seventeen dollars. Two hundred and seventeen dollars. Thank you very much. Oh. Give me a minute. What you got? Something you should see. Oh. That's... very unfortunate. What are you gonna do about it? Make it disappear. That might not be so easy. People might be coming after him. Just do your fucking job. Oh. Oh. Prick. Fucking prick. Come on. - You go there. - Okay. Hey, find anything? No. Shit. Come on, let's go. Go, go, go, they're coming. Here you go, princess. Thank you. Keep it. - What flavor did you get? - Bubblegum. Oh, wait. Do you want anything? No, no, no. I'm good, I'm good. You just enjoy yourself. Bubblegum. How's new boy working out? He's all right. Learning. He like you, you like him kinda thing? I wouldn't say that. Well, that's good. I like that. You gotta be a little careful. Careful how? Well... You know, you and me, we ain't that different. I come up in this. - You did? - Yep. Me and Sway. I was about your age when I met him. What was he like back then? Kinda like he is now, except, little bit more run down, if you can believe that. Yeah, he's got the same problem now as he had when I met him. - And what's that? - His heart's too big. You gotta be careful who you trust in this life. You see what I'm saying, don't you? I think so. You know why I am the way I am? 'Cause I wanted more. And I wasn't gonna ask for it. I just took it. You know, most people in this life, they spend their whole lives working for somebody else. You don't wanna get stepped on, sometimes you gotta take this out of it. You gotta just grab what you want. Ain't nobody gonna give it to you. You understand what I'm saying? Yeah, I do. Smart girl. - There you go. - Thank you. I like this. Oh, you do? Well, I mean, what's not to like? We have everything we need, we do whatever we want. Do you ever miss your family? My family didn't want me. And I don't want them. Besides, now we have each other. Yeah. You miss them, don't you? Look, you did the right thing, okay? And if they knew the truth, they would think so too. - And that girl... - Loux. Loux. She won't ever forget what you did for her. Do you believe in fate, Oscar? I don't know. What's that? It's like... Everything happens the way it's supposed to. Bad and good. I think so. Okay, well, I do. And... I believe that someday Loux will find you. Really? Yeah. But, for now, you have me. And I believe that something brought us together. We just have to stick together, okay? Yes. Now there's just one more thing. See? That wasn't so bad, right? Yeah. I think I'm gonna call you "O" from now on. Is that okay? Yeah. You won't disappear on me, right, O? Never. Promise me. I promise. Good. How'd you do at the track today? Not good. Told you, Bird. Can't trust a white stain. - Uh, let me get you another. - I'm fine. Nice of you to show up a half hour late and leave me alone with this cocksucker. Congressman. There's a problem. Come to think of it, maybe I will take that drink. Sure. Don't forget the twist. Kid made quite a mess. Sure did. Sway seems to think we should cut him loose. Yeah, that ain't gonna happen. What is this place? You'll see. You ever think about just getting up and going? Maybe Kansas City. You've ever had barbecue from Kansas City? It's the best! Huh? Cherry pie. Huh? Huh? I don't know. You're in love, ain't you? Yeah. Wow. Young love. Ain't nothing better than that. Ain't nothing worse either. It can kill you. Yeah, that's true. Oh, boy! Okay, come on. It's all about balance, okay? Take this thing and put it right here, in the crook of your shoulder. Okay. Hold it like that. - You try it. - Okay. You got to make sure you hold it steady now. Good girl. Looks good. Hey, Bird. Sway, Birdie's teaching me how to go hog hunting. Oh. Uh, that's nice, sweetie. Why don't you just point it right at his belly? It's kinda the same size as the hog. Hmm. Peaches here tells me you're a quick learner. That's right, he is, right? Yeah. Well, that's good. Man, you got a shitload of people after you. Police. It says here... you killed a man. And I'm sure you had your reasons, but... I mean, do you wanna go back and face a mess like that? I can make this whole thing go away. I think you'd do real good here with us. You understand what he's saying to you, son? Yes. You're a smart boy. All right. Why don't you give us a minute? Uh, what? Oh. Neville, you stay. What's up? How many years we go back, Neville? You've always been a champion of the work that we do here. You know? - I just can't have you deviating from the job. - What are you talking about? That boy. You got your reservations about whether he should stay or whether he should go. What are you talking about? 'Cause I've given you no cause... Safety's next. Make sure the safety is off. That's this thing right here. - Okay. - Atta girl. Yeah, uh... Just quit playing, all right? And when you feel like you got a hog in your sights, you just pull that trigger. Oscar, I didn't know the gun was loaded. I didn't... I didn't know the gun was loaded, okay? I didn't fucking know! It's okay, Peaches. It's okay. Go get her, son. Hey, Oscar, look at me. Look at me. It's okay. These things happen. All right? All right, get him out of here, and run back and clean this shit up. You know I will. Thank you. Excuse me? I'm Lester. Rineau Private Eye. What can I do for you? I'm here for the interview. We spoke on the phone. Oh, yeah. Well, come on in. Have a seat. Sorry about the mess. So, uh, you have any experience in the detective field? No, sir, I don't. I thought the ad was for a secretary? Of... Of course, yeah. Uh, well, tell me a little bit about yourself. Well, I just moved here a few weeks ago. I have mostly worked at restaurants, but the last diner I was at went out of business, so I thought I would try something new. Um, but I'm a really quick learner. I just need somebody to be punctual, present, answer the phone. - Think you can handle that? - Yes. Yeah, I can. Great. Then I'll see you tomorrow at 8:00. Oh, okay. Okay, great. I'll see you tomorrow at 8:00. Uh, thank you so much. Uh, excuse me, sir, uh... Do you know where South Main Street is? South Main Street is this way. - Okay... wallet. - Whoa! - Okay... All right. All right. - Hurry up! I'm gonna get to that. One second. I just got all this stuff in my pockets and... The fuck is wrong with you? Take your weapon. Who could tell me what they did wrong? - Suckers! - They came too close. Look, let me show you how it's done. Give me the gun. Come on. Point it at me. Things are not moving fast enough, then you cock it. Cock it. If he don't move after that, that's when you have a real problem. That's when... That's when you get in his face. That's when you put the heat on him. Show him that you're crazy. Look, there is an art to this. I don't want anything to happen to you kids. Focus, guys, come on. - Eyes open all the time, even when they're closed. - Yes, sir. All right, let's get something to eat. Come on. Oh, yeah! I like the way you think. I need for you to get there early, get their money orders. They usually come pick 'em up before noon. I know you don't like this job, son. It's probably the last time we're gonna do it. But we gotta keep the checkbooks balanced, don't we? You pickin' up what I'm putting down? I'm pickin' it up, Bird, but I don't think it's a good idea. We're not ready. Someone's gonna get hurt. We got lucky the first time. You don't think I'm asking you, do you? We'll get it done. Good. But what in the fuck do you think is going on with Peaches? What do you mean? It's just... She don't... She don't seem to wanna do nothing as a group anymore. She just wants to go off on her own, she keeps bugging me about her end of the money. - She said that? - She said that. You ain't noticed this shit? I don't know, Bird. Fuckin' women, man. Get to be a certain age, they start getting all desperate and shit, they start making stupid choices. Do me a favor. Keep a close eye on her, will you? Okay. All right. Thanks, O. Hey, O. You know you're my right hand, right? You know there ain't nobody I trust like you. Without you, this whole thing goes away. I hear you, Bird. All right. Peaches. The fuck is up with him? What do you mean? I don't know. He seems kinda distant, right? He's probably just lost in one of his stupid books. No, no, it ain't that. Just like, he wants to do everything on his own. He don't wanna be part of the group no more. You know, men... They get to be a certain age, they get delusions of grandeur. They wanna run everything by themselves. Keep an eye on him for me? Of course, I will. That's my girl. You know you're my right hand man, right? You're the only one around here I can trust. I know, daddy-o. Fine. What are you reading? Rumble Fish. Who is it by? - It's S.E. Hinton. - S.E. Hinton? Yeah, S.E. Hinton. Is he good? It's a... It's a she, not a he. Sounds like a boy's name. - I think that's the point. - What do you mean? I think she wanted people to think she was a boy. Well, why would she want that? So they would take her more seriously. Hey! Kiss me. Do you ever think about, like, just leaving this place, like, to do something on our own? What are you saying? I'm saying, have you ever thought about it? You said you won't disappear on me. I'm not going to disappear on you. How many times do you want me to say it? What? Nothing. - Hi, good morning. - Morning. What the fuck did you do? You weren't here. I figured I'd fix the place up a little bit. Wha... Is something wrong? I had everything exactly the way I wanted it. Nobody touches this desk! Look, why don't you just... go home for the rest of the day? Just go. - Go! - Okay, I'm, I'm really sorry. Now, don't anyone forget anything, all right? - All right. - Lost Boys. - Till the end. Till the end. - Till the end. Get down! Get down on the floor. Surprise, motherfucker! Get your ass on the ground. You hear? Don't fucking move! Stay fucking down. Everyone down on the fucking ground. Okay, let's fucking go. Let's fucking go. Come on! Get down right now! Hurry the fuck up! Okay, that's just so that you know this is a real gun, that it's loaded and that we are not fucking around. Come on, come on. Move, move, move, move. Get your fucking asses over there. All right, you've seen this on TV. You know the drill. Lie down. Lie the fuck down on your stomach. Palms down. Right, Lost Boys? Yeah! Where's the fucking manager? No one fucking moves, all right? If somebody fucking moves, fucking shoot 'em. Miho, chill, I got you, bro. You're not messing with me right now. Do you know what key it is? All right, open it. Come on, open it. Goddamn! Oh, shit! Shit. Oh, God. Come with me. Come with me. Come with me. - The fuck happened? - Oh, God. Lay down. Lay down. What the fuck? All right, Lost Boys, out, out! Hey, hey. Apply pressure on there. Hey, y'all, watch this. All right. Who's Pockets? Who's Pockets? Oh, hell no. Hell no. This tastes like shit, bro. - I told you. I told you. - Hey! - What is this? - It's your shit. Get out of here. Go. Get out of here. Line up. Hey, what the fuck are you talking about? You don't wanna be here, so get out of here. You don't respect this family, so leave. I don't wanna leave. Are you kidding me? You know what happened today? Do you know that someone got shot? I'm gonna go. I'm sorry, but, he shouldn't have been fucking with me. He got what he deserved. That man deserved that? You think that's what I'm teaching you? - Oh, look... - Look... Am I talking to you? Do you know what that world thinks of you? They think you're black, white trash, garbage. You know what I think of you? I think everyone here is gold. Everyone here has value. You're worth something. You're a part of something. You don't respect that? There you go. There's a cold world just waiting for you, kid. Whoa! Dude, just chill. - Oh, come on, man. - Don't tell me to chill. - What the fuck man? - Jesus Christ! - Motherfucker. - Oh, my God. Stop! - Stop it. Stop it! - Relax. Get your hands off of me. Relax. - What the fuck are you doing, man? - Stop. Oh, my God. In the morning, whoever has an "X" on their arm is gonna be a part of this family. Everyone who doesn't is a fucking stranger. You guys know how I feel about strangers. - Lester? - Quiet! I'm thinking. What do you want? The name on this box, Carbone. Who is that? Why? I'm just curious. I mean... Everything else is labeled missing persons or infidelities. That's the only one with a name on it. I hired you to answer the phone, not to be in here asking questions. Sorry. My wife, Margaret, she had a theory about the name on that box. She worked very hard on it. What was her theory? That there's no good in this town anymore. Mmm. What, um, happened to her, if you don't mind me asking? She died. I'm sorry. Do me a favor. Let the name on that box die too. Okay. I'm gonna turn in early. - You make sure you lock up. - Okay. - All right, well, have a good night. - Yeah, good night. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Hi, where's the Missing Persons? Uh, the woman just behind there. I know. I'll get out of here around 5:00. I'll be out front. Okay. Yes, can I help you? Hi, is there someone I can talk to about a missing boy? - Have you filled out a report? - No, I have not yet. I... Flan, this young lady wants to fill a missing person's report. What's the name? Well, a report was already filed about fifteen years ago. 15 years ago? Honey, I've been doing this a long time. After a few days, things don't look good. Okay, well, is... I mean, do you guys have any records, or what would you suggest I do? - Is it family, a friend? - It's an old friend. Why don't you come back tomorrow and we'll talk more? - 9:00 work? - Yeah, that would be great. - Thank you. - Don't mention it. - And what was your name? - Jim. Jim Flannery. Jim Flannery. Okay, thank you so much. Amos, look what I found. Give me one second. Okay. What? Okay. Okay. Okay. - Does something make sense? I mean, I looked at it... - Okay, okay, okay. Start here in Brady Heights, 546, New Haven. Then Greenwood District, 808, Rockingham. And then, out near Reservoir Hill, 1161, New Haven. Peach, what's up? I just had that dream. Come, come. There was this little girl crying. Then she was like there, but not there. Come on. Take this off. I can see through her. And then she keeps saying she lost her body. She doesn't know that I am her body. And I keep trying to go closer to her. But she goes farther and I go closer and she just disappears and I'm just falling. And I just fall. I... It's like space doesn't exist. And then I just... disappeared. You got so big, you know that? You got so big. I love you! You love me, baby? I love you, too. You're real pretty, baby. That's how you look at me, you little freak? Ha! He'll be right in. Anything else? - No, thank you. - Mmm-hmm. Ah, thank you so much for seeing me. Of course. - Miss? - Loux Robins. What a beautiful name. Oh, thank... Thank you. Well, then, why don't you tell me what you know. Well, he was my best friend. We grew up together. He ran away about 15 years ago. I brought with me a copy of the report that was filed back then. Um, there it is. His name is Oscar Grey. He was 13. Does something look familiar to you? Where did you get this? I found it, um, at work. And where's work? Rineau Private Eye. I see. Tell me about yourself. Um, I just moved here with my brother. And how's that going? Um, we're finding our way. Where are you staying? Um, we're at the Desert Hills. That's a rough area for a pretty girl. It's... It's been okay. I'll tell you what. Leave this file with me. I'll ask around and see if I can turn something up. That would be great. Thank you so much, Officer. Jim. Call me Jim. Okay, Jim, thank you. Hi! Howdy. I'm Tali. - How you doing? I'm Bud. - This is Bud. Um, we're in room 9 and our outlets are dead and I was just wondering if I could use yours to straighten my hair. - My wife's crazy. - I have a big interview. - Sweetie. - She's got a big interview tomorrow. - Big interview and we're from Tallahassee. - Tallahassee. Anyway, look, we'll just be one foot in, one foot out. Oh, my God! You are a lifesaver. Fucking move, I will blow your brain straight through your skull. Anyone else here? What the... Oscar... Get the fuck over there. Get the fuck over there. Get... Peaches, tie him up. You have the tape? Where did you leave the tape? - In the fucking car. - We talked about this in the car. Fucking do something about it. We had a whole fucking conversation about the tape on the way over here. Are you fucking kidding me? Where's the fucking tape? Jesus Christ! It was not my fucking job! What do you mean it's not your job? I said we talked about it. I said, "You tape him." I said I'm gonna put a... Don't move, all right? This is really bad. Let's get the fuck out of here. - Oh! - Yeah, yeah. - Oh. Excuse me. Sorry. - Oh. Sorry. Whoever they are, they got everything on you. On us. Pictures, files. Looks like they knew everything back a long fucking time. Oh, you saw it. You want to know what the most difficult animal is to hunt? It's the American grizzly. Want to know why? You see that thing from 200 meters out. You take a shot, you don't kill it... Now that bear's hunting you. And when it comes for you... it's coming from behind. What are you saying, Bird? What I'm saying is, they took their shot. And it wasn't a kill. Now we're hunting them. How you doing, Lester? Bird. Why don't you have a seat? I thought we was friends, Lester. Friends? You were my sister's date at the Sadie Hawkins dance. Yeah, yeah. I was real sorry to hear about Margaret. I gotta tell ya, I was a little hurt you didn't invite me to the funeral. Yeah, I... I don't... I... It's okay, Lester. I'm just bustin' your balls. Well, you got me there. Where is she, Les? Who? Oh, the girl? Oh, well, um... She gone. Yeah, she, uh... She split town. She... She, um... Shit. Bird, I told her to leave it. I see. You are better than this, Bird. You know? We gotta go. - Okay. - Now. - I'll get it. - All right. Hello? Tell the Lost Boys we're going on a camping trip. What are we gonna do?? Everyone packed up. 1133, Main. - Got it? - Yeah. What's going on? We gotta pack up our shit. I'll get the van started. Hey, where's O? - Dive in. - Come on. Come on. My name is Pockets, by the way. Hey, I'm Loux. This is Amos. - Come on. - All right. Miss Robins? Loux, Loux, Loux. Loux, Loux, Loux, Loux. You know what they do to cop killers? They don't let 'em live. I know that. People like you... The fucking trash. This world ain't setup for you to win. You'd be rotting in a cell if it weren't for me. We gave you life. Tools. A community. And you wanna bite the hand that fed you. Shame on you. You're never gonna get out of here alive. You ain't a cop. - Peach. - What are you doing? We need to go. - Come on. - Where are you going? - We're going. - No, we're not going. - What do you mean we're going? - I mean, Loux came back. - Loux? - Loux is back, yeah. - So you're gonna disappear? - No, I'm no gonna... - Come on. We don't have time... - You're fucking like everyone else! - Come on, stop. Come on... - You promised you wouldn't disappear. - I'm not disappearing. - You are disappearing. - I was just looking for you. - You fucking lied! I didn't lie about shit. Come on, let's go... Oh, my God! Oh, my God! - Oh, my God! - What did you do? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - What did you do? - I'm sorry. I fucking... You fucking shot me! You fucking killed me! Why are you so fucked up? Fuck, Peaches, you just fucking killed me. You just fucking killed me. - Why did you do that? Why did you do that? - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. We should get you to a hospital. Don't stop. Promise me you won't stop. I promise. Well, what do we do now? You can always run with the hunted. Cricket. Will you read to us? "To the red country and part of the gray country of Oklahoma, "the last rains came gently, "and they did not cut the scarred earth. "The plows crossed and recrossed the rivulet marks.
