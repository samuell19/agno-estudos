We have to go and find her. I'll go check. (DRAMATIC INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) He is not normal. Last night I didn't even bother coming home and he didn't care. But where have you been? Working. What do you think? We had to deliver to a German client. (SPEAKS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) But didn't he know? Of course he knew! But still. Is this good? I love these. Can I have? Sure. Any normal guy would ask where are you honey? Where have you been? But not Tom! He's so indifferent. Was he like that when you were dating him? I don't remember. It's been a long time ago. He was just this guy with simple needs. He's simple. (BABY CRYING) Maybe you can simply take him back. Where's Shamu? Who? I wanna live. I want to create. I don't want this anymore.

Hey, if you need a breather, there's a good spot to stretch around the bush. No, I can't stop. You feel better after stretching. Oh, thank you. Okay. Let me guess. You are running from a lover. Oh I wish. Creditors? Worse. What could be worse than death and taxes? My parents. They must be in pretty good shape then. (LAUGHS) Yeah. You know I feel like life is too short and beautiful to be complaining about our parents. I'm not complaining. Every woman has a complaint. For you, it's your parents, while most women complain about dieting. Oh. You got that right. I mean about dieting cause if you're a woman and you want to stay slim, according to today's standards, the only way how to eat is in front of the mirror naked. Well, as much as I would love to see that I think I should probably try and ask her out on a date first. Yeah. (SLOW INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) This is my card. Great. So I'll see you tomorrow at the breakfast place. Okay. Okay awesome. You know, it's such a happy coincidence that you're a real estate agent. My condo, that thing's been up for sale for God knows how long now. Really? Yeah, it feels like forever. It doesn't surprise me but I'm more than happy to help you. Great. Awesome. By the way, cell phone's not valid anymore. I will replace it tomorrow. Okay. I'm not that easy to reach either. I work in a hospital as a brain surgeon so I gotta keep my phone off at all times in there. Well I will never disturb you. I promise. Home address not valid either and employer either, so... Well I'm really glad you gave me the card then. Make sure not to lose it. (LAUGHS) Well, so bye and oh. (UPBEAT INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) Gotta go. See you tomorrow. (UPBEAT INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) (WOMAN LAUGHING) Thank you. I'm so happy to see you. Tom left us! No! So sorry. Said he'll be gone for four days on a business trip! Four days? Okay. What am I gonna do with all this house work? I can't clean or cook. Who's gonna take care of my little sweet rads? Well, you. Are you out of your mind? I have to find a nanny. Did you say that you were out of a job? Could you help out maybe for a bit? Well my situation has changed. Has changed. How so? So his name is Dr. Steve Press. Where did you meet this guy? When did this happen? I was running at the park. At the park. This park? Wow. And he's the best kisser ever! You kissed him? In this park! Been here 10 years, I've never met anybody. Wow! Yeah I know. You have kids, right? So it's kind of... You can at least come help out for a day. Just today. Okay. Okay. (SLOW INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) You have no idea who I am. You never understand me. You never listen to me. I told you many times that I don't like French restaurant. There's a brain here. I'm not an animal. Give me the key. I'm leaving. I'm leaving! Give me the keys. Why are you laughing at me? Stop looking at me like this! You look like a stupid robot! I'm talking to you, Brian! Say something! I'm done. What? I'm done! Oh you're done (LAUGHS). Take the penthouse. Take the car. I'm done. Brian? I got the penthouse. There it is. Yep. I only need a power supply and the device should work. What? Power supply for the device. What are you talking about? What are you talking about when our daughter is unsupervised, not protected somewhere under the snow maybe crying? (CRIES) I don't understand. You sure you don't wanna go to your parents? It's been like three days you haven't changed. Why so much concern about my look? Because obviously most people aren't blind. Well I can't go back there. I wish I had what you have. What do I have that you don't have? Normal human family. Ha, family. Family is supposed to mean so much to me. Well, I'll give you a piece of advice, sweetie. Think twice before you fall into your Mr. Perfect Kiss. Children are overrated. Believe me. I know a little something about it. (DRAMATIC INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) Where is she going now? (DRAMATIC INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) Hi. Hi. Mom, dad, what are you doing here? We found your phone. No! Listen, I'm 30 years old and I've been covering for you all my life. You know what? From now on, I'm not sacrificing myself for your stupid mission anymore. Ha. Hey. Hi. Why did you give that guy (MUMBLES)? You don't know what I have to put up with here. What was I to do? Can't live with my parents anymore. You're the stupidest man on earth! Why don't you just give me two or three months rent on the condo and then you can just live there until you sell it? Really? Thank you. You're so generous. Here's the address. See you there tonight. (PHONE BEEPING) I got an emergency at the hospital. It must be beautiful to save lives. I gotta go. Oh, do you still have those Excel lease contracts? Yeah sure. I just figured, you know, I could use it as a template. Oh, I must have forgotten them at my friend's house. I'm sorry. No worries. Just bring them over tonight. I'll see you soon. Seriously? I can't believe you people. Tanya, darling, please! He's not for real! Anybody who approaches me is not for real except for your Russian idiot. You should pay respect to your mother. Where am I not paying respect to her? Don't talk to your father like that! Sometimes I really would wish to get closer to you. Just to understand how can you go through life with no brain whatsoever. You know why I hate bullies? They're so despicable. (DOOR SHUTS) (DRAMATIC INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) Are you kidding me? I will call the police. (POUNDING ON DOOR) (DRAMATIC INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) My parents locked me in my room and Dr. Press is waiting for me. I cannot get out of my apartment. Why is it that all good things in this life are bad for you? Either they're perverse or makes us gain weight. Did you drink? No, not yet. I'm begging you. Can you please come to his place? This is (MUMBLES) talking for me. He wants me to see his condo. Just call him. I already did. He doesn't pick up the phone. He must be in a surgery. And what does all this have to do with me? Well I forgot the documents at your place. So? Dr. Press is expecting to get them tonight! I get it. Dr. Perfect Kiss. Exactly. Dr. Perfect Kiss. Will you please go there? I'm scared that if he finds out what a loser I am he won't deal with me anymore. Okay I'll go. But only if you promise to babysit my kids every time Tom goes away. Thank you, thank you! Bye. Yes! (FOOTSTEPS WALKING) Hello? Hello? Oh. I'm sorry. I'm gonna go. No. No, no. Yes, yes, yes. Come in. I insist. No, no. No. Yes, yes, yes. (PHONE RINGING) Rex Realty, how can I help you?

Is there some kind of policy that you can't have a morning date here that I don't know about? Well you can't date in the morning and be serious. If it's a dinner date... It wasn't supposed to be a morning date but I was locked in my apartment and I couldn't get out and my... Did you just say you were locked in your apartment? Anyway, it's none of your business, okay? Bye. Would you just let me give you a ride please? I don't think so. I'm good with metro because now I know how to buy the ticket. Bye. Hey, come on in. Hi. How are you? Good. Have a seat. Here.

Yes, Madame. Well, no, Madame. Actually it's because the other madame recently moved out. To the penthouse? Yes, I've heard something like that. Yeah. Oh by the way, dinner will be slightly delayed. We have new staff but they're very highly recommended. Okay. (SLOW INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) (SLOW INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) Sorry. Absolutely beautiful. Just like you. Listen I asked you here... Brian, I have to tell you something. No, just let me finish please. Otherwise I'll never get the courage to tell you.

But I couldn't stop thinking about you and I can't stop thinking about you. And yes, I am a successful man but success doesn't necessarily mean happiness.

And I don't have a boyfriend. You don't? No. Really? Yes. That really makes me the happiest man on the planet. So it would be okay if I did this? (FLOWING ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) That would be really absolutely okay. Let's do it again. (UPBEAT INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) I'm hungry. Hungry? (UPBEAT INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) I got new kitchen staff, so...
