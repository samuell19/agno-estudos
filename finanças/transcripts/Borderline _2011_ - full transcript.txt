As far as I remember, I have always been convinced that I would distinguish myself from the others. I know, it's stupid, but it's probably because I was fascinated by Gandhi. - Hello Dad. - Hello Romain. Gandhi started as a lawyer, and if I'm a lawyer today, I think it's probably because of him. Being a lawyer seemed the best option to become someone. I thought I had everything to succeed, but something unexpected happened. Nothing that I hoped happened. Nothing. - Hello. - Hello. Yes? "A pure business" Go away. Get lost! - Ah, you have a bitch? - No, a dog. I forgot to tell you Morisset invites us to lunch at Chateaubriand. - Today? - Today, yes. I can't. I have to present my conclusions before 4 and... - You can't do that to me. I can do it, if you... I don't know, I don't want to... He's your client. Do you mind, Pelame? Well, I can settle this. I told you that but... It's settled. I'm sure Morisset will like Teller. Are you sure your dog is not a bitch? No, it's a dog, a bastard. Telemachus, don't stay here. Unbelievable... - Hello sweetie, how are you? - Hello, Dad. David! This capon is not cooked. It's true, it's pink. How long did you cook it? As usual, 45 minutes. A capon has to be cooked an hour minimum. It's not cooked. 45 minutes, an hour... We have to cook it 10 minutes more. Don't eat this. Dad, put your wing back in the plate. I'll eat it like that. Can I go to New Year's Eve party at Boris'? Charlotte's parents are OK to let me sleep over. You can call them. I won't call them. I'll come pick you up at midnight. - You don't go out? - No, we don't. I'm not going to get home at midnight on New year's Eve. I can get home myself. You already can go out with this Boris, so you won't get home alone. - You say that because he's fat? - What? Not at all, not at all... But he could make an effort. Dad? Well, it's true that midnight is a little early. You could let her go until 0:30. - Or even 1:00. - Really, Dad? - You Mum would have done that. Well, OK for 0:30. But not later. I knew you would like it. It's wonderful. - That one's for Grand-Pa. - Thank you. Who got me that one? Oh, it's my daughter! - You don't even know what it is. - I'm sure you spoiled me. You can tell us if you don't like it. You can change it. - It's a skateboard. - Thanks Dad. - The vendor told me that... - That one's for you Dad. What is it? Well, open it. - I mean, who got me that? - Mum. Christine, we said: "No gift between us". I'm sorry but I have nothing for you. We said: "No gift", Why did you do it anyway? It's OK. It's OK, but now I'm ridiculous. What? People usually do it anyway. I wouldn't have done that to your Mum. - Forget about it. Who wants some log? It's melting. Nobody? OK. I'm sorry, we said: "No gift", so I didn't buy any gift. I'll be walking my dog. Come here Norbert. Norbert, you're stupid. Out of my way! What a jerk! Don't move! Stop! - Fucker. - Stop! Shut up, Norbert. It's OK now. Come here. "Need 25 tube tickets for tomorrow night, thanks." What is that mess? Oh, shit... Sir. You forgot your bag on your hood. Oh yeah, thank you. Shit... David? Yes, I'm coming up! - David! - I'm there, I'm coming up. - What were you doing? - I heard a suspicious noise. Did you smoke? No. I'm not a kid, I don't smoke in the basement. Are you coming up? Go ahead, I'm coming. Hello. And then, we'll see... Excuse me for being late. Telemachus, shut up. Come on, don't stay here. There you go. Good. Where was I? Morisset wants to lunch with Villeneuve again. Yes and Morisset highly recommended you to Villeneuve. Nice. Since the last lunch, he can't stop talking about you. So, we'll go together. - OK. Anybody can answer this phone? Telemachus! Shut up, shut up! Good job, Pelame... They're going to be in trouble now. The logistics won't follow without you. - I give them three weeks. Christine... Your envelope. They don't have the right to fire you. What is your problem? Can't you wait two seconds before honking? You want to piss me off? You think this fucking car doesn't already piss me off? My husband has to fix it for two years! Don't piss me off too! Fuck! Because you work for assholes, you don't need to become one! I'm fed up! One last thing: Pelame, take care of this, please. It's a contract about a field close to a retail area. They want to build a parking. It's technical, it's for you. That's it, it's over. Break the ranks! Thank you all. - Can I talk to you? - In your office or mine? Let's go in mine. Do you know how to type accents? No. Can we talk a little? Yes, of course. I feel bad, Pelame. Morisset wants to deal with Teller from now on. He was my biggest client, and... You're doing a great job, but Teller and Morisset are like wolves. Nothing can stop them. It might be you... We'll talk about it. - So, what can I... - Telemachus, come here sweetie. It's not honest. "William, urgent favour to ask you for New Year's Eve." Hello? - Hello, William? William, it's Vladimir. What are you doing? I was worried. Are you OK? Actually, William is not there anymore. -What is that bullshit? David, dinner is ready. I've got to talk to him. Hello? Well... it's impossible. Impossible? What is impossible? I need 50 tube tickets, it's urgent. Do you have tickets? - Are you calling for cocaine? - Can you bring me some? I can't talk right now. No. Yes. Goodbye. Goodbye. Yes. It's not very good, Mum. - I'll only eat the cheese. - No, eat the croutons too. - Eat. - No, I don't like it. Do we have a scale? Why? You want to diet? No. Where is it? Er... In the cupboard, up the sink on the right. - Hello. - No, I'm not interested. Actually... - I don't need what you're selling. - I'm the new... Idiot... "Not interested"? Let's see. Idiot. -Hello? - Hello, I'm the guy behind your door. - What do you mean? - Actually, I'm "the new William". Can you open and... - Oh, so you're... the new guy. - Yes. - Pleased to meet you, Vladimir. - Hello. Sorry, so many jerks these days. - Yeah. - I don't say that for you. Well, come in. 1 000, 2 000, 3 000... You want some Champagne? - No, I... 4 000. I will need you next week. It was just to help you out. - How am I going to do? - I put a little more as a gift. - What's funny? - Nothing. Why? Well, you're... You're smiling. No, I'm not smiling. How is work? Good, nothing special. Can you get the car fixed? I've done it. Well, that's great. It had to be done. So I thought: "Let's do it". Your car is ready. - Thank you. - Have a good one. "Dismissal for serious misconduct" "We had to mourn unacceptable and violent words from you..." Merry Christmas. Do you like them? I wasn't sure, they had... - Stop it. Do you think I'm dumb? - What? - I can see your little game. Between your secret calls downstairs, the car you got fixed, your stupid recent happiness and now that! When did you start cheating on me? - What? - When did you start? - I'm not cheating on you! Because if you hope to feel better by offering me earrings, you can hang them where I think. I take care of everything for years! You fuck random asses and I have to accept your stupid comedy? It's pathetic. Come with me. Here is how I'm cheating on you. What is this? It's drugs. Are you on drugs? - Of course not, Christine. There are enough drugs to supply the whole city. I found this in the street and... - In the street? Yes, I found this in the street and I... ...sold a little bit of it. - You did what? - A little. Are you crazy? It's illegal. What if the owner of the bag gets back to you? If he's a killer? These guys are killers! I thought about it. Obviously, I thought about it. I found this one week ago and nobody claimed it, I mean... I think the critical stage has passed. Theoretically, I think... - Theoretically, it's all good, that's it? So now, we sell drugs here? My husband found drugs in the street and it's fine... Are you dumb or what? Yes, I think you're right. I think you're totally right, I'm dumb. I'm totally dumb. Totally dumb to work for people who are using me. Who live the life I wanted to live. We've always been honest, we've always been loyal and what did we get back? Nothing! We're nowhere! I know very well I'll never be a partner. I'm not totally... even if I look like. And I know you've been fired. Yeah, I know you've been fired. So, what is it, what is the next step? Getting into debt to live our shitty life? That's it? Do you know what this represents? Five years of Miss Pelame's salary. And net of tax. So, to me, this bag is a gift from heaven. Then we'll be able to get the life we've always dreamed of. I'm unhappy, you're unhappy. We're unhappy. And in any case, if we don't sell this drug, somebody else will do it. What do you say? - Good morning. - Hey. I'm sorry. I... I was wrong. I'll get rid of this bag. - No need. You did it? Did what? You want a glass? Here. - OK, I'm interrupting. Nice... What did you do? Did you know that cutting pure coke with powder milk can give you 40% more profits. - What? - Did you know that? - That one was on promo. - I didn't notice that. So, our packets will have the same weight. I want a fair trade, OK? - OK. - And we officially started tango. "Tan" what? Tango. - The dance? - Yes. This is the kind of activities people of our age do. It will be easier. OK? Turn on the left here. I want nobody to be exploited. No junkie with ugly skin. Nobody under 21. And you don't sell to those who can't pay. We're not gangsters. What do you think? - Well, my problem is just the tango dance. We can't do that every day. We could take advantage of Romain going to judo on Friday and tell Marion she can go out with her boyfriend, Boris. - Yes, very good. - What? - Yes. This Boris looks kind. You know, big cheeks usually give good faces. Hello. For cocaine deliveries please give me your name, address and the reason of your call. Tell me the exact quantity of cocaine you want to be delivered. I said "cocaine". I'll do it again without saying "cocaine". So, leave me a text indicating the reason of your call, the quantity you need, and I may call you back. You might know why you're calling since you're the one who calls. I'll call you back. Oh, I'm getting confused. I sell happiness. Let's be cool. Hello. Hello. That's better, more professional. Hello. Hello, hello. You can leave me a message. I'll listen to it and I'll call you back as soon as possible. We don't know each other, but I like you. Thanks for the trust. Nice. Nice but maybe a little too much familiar. Or I ask Christine to do it. Hello? It's not William, I replace him. What can I do for you? I'm there. - Hello. - Sorry. - How are you? - Good. - I'm Naomi. - Your little packet. What's your name? You have a name? - Yeah, yeah. Er... I'm Goliath. Goliath? Goliath is your real name? - Goliath, yes. - OK. -Are you leaving now? Yes, I'm going to Rome for a fashion show. I'm late, I'm tired. - I'll take your suitcase. - OK. Do you know Rome? - No, I've never been there. - I love that city. - I had it for Christmas. - Your Dad bought it for you? Yeah, I'm so happy. Nice skateboard. Can you lend it to me? Well, I haven't used it yet. Well, I'm a nice guy, so you lend it to me? - It's a gift from my Dad. - From your Dad? You think I'll steal it? - I prefer not to... - Give it to me! OK? Get out of here. Come on, let's go. It's OK, it's OK. I know them, they are fuckers. Seriously, if we've been burly we would have kicked them down... - Sam, Sam... Shut up. No but seriously Romain, it's true... I said shut up. So? You take the honour. Are we taking a big risk? Well, yes. Twenty years. Twenty years... But do you really think they'll come for us? Take a look at us. Come on, go ahead. Come on. Come on. Come on. I can't believe it. It's huge. I told you. Net of tax. - Oh my God... - Do you see how fast it is? And we can do it again. - Yeah! We've got something there. And we can do it again. Oh my God! Listen Goliath, I'll give you the money. This time I can't. - We don't sell to broke people. - My parents aren't here. How can I do? - See the woman in the car? She's my boss. And she's got two principles: not selling to broke people and to young people. Have a good night, big boy. Bastard... Fucker! He's young and broke. Plus he's cranky. Didn't we decide that? It's perfect. - Come on, let's go. - OK. It's clear. Go ahead. This is my husband. Wow, I'm surprised you're here. Why? I just wanted to go out. This place is ideal for business. Nice, you found that by yourself? Which one is your wife? The splendid blond with the red dress. - The yellow one. The red one. She's my Christine. The love of my life. - How long have you been together? - Almost 21 years. 21 years? I don't know how you do this. I'm with the little blond one, Lola. We all saw that. That's why she's here. She's 21, it's funny. I know it will be over soon. Women are like movies, I don't like to do them too often. You're funny. Here. Can you hold that? - Sure. - Happy new year. - Happy new year. Are you OK? Who's that? One of your clients, Nicolas Bidermann. - Oh, OK. - Goodbye. Goodbye, M. Bidermann. Miss. He's maybe my next boss. - Really? - Yeah... Come on, come on! I want you so bad. We haven't made love like that since... Since never. My love... I was thinking... We should save money for the children. That would be some money for them and some for us. OK. But not right now because I'm going to need some. Why? What is this? You're crazy, honey. The one I bought is black. Red leather interior. Are you happy? You're crazy, my love. Browsing Morisset's investigation file, I realized that Morisset's company personally offered plane tickets to Villeneuve. So... He can be indicted for concealment. Well, he could have. I didn't wait any longer. I contacted Villeneuve who reimbursed the plane tickets right away. Excuse me. Yes. No, it's me. In five short minutes... I'm sorry. Thank you. You violated the investigation secrecy. This is a crime. I call that an opportunity. You shouldn't be worried by this. You neither. Officially, you don't know anything. In return for this service, Villeneuve wants me to be his lawyer. And you're not afraid of all this, Pelame? Should I? You're surprising me, Pelame. He's surprising me! Doesn't he surprise you? My dear Pelame, welcome to the club! What a fantastic story! If I did that, I wouldn't be here today! Oh my God! You didn't forget it. Splendid, David. - It's my favourite cake. - Very nice. Bravo. Cheers. - Happy birthday. - Cheers. You drink alcohol? Well, we don't do this every day. I want to celebrate. You're beautiful. More and more every day. - Thank you. Cheers! - Happy birthday, my girl. Happy birthday. Thank you, Sir. How do you say? My best wishes, Christine. This is for you. So how is it going, David? Is it yarrow? That's it? I love that. It reminds me my childhood. Sorry, but I think we don't know you. Do you or not? - We don't. - It's true, we don't. - He was seated there. - We don't know each other yet. But you've got something that is mine. Uh? It's my bag. What bag? He'll tell you. David... Can you explain to him? We've got a group of smarties here. So, how much do we have here? Uh? - 120 000. For how long have you been selling this? Around two months. Not bad for two months. Not bad at all. Nothing's missing, by chance? Well... We spent it a little. There you go. So, my share... is 134 000. How do we proceed? I can find the money. I just need some time. Let's say four days. Four days. Plus the interests. It's 1 000 a day. So kids, what's the result? - 4 000. - 4 000. Oh no, Mum! I want you to leave! - David, no "I want", but "I would like". By the way... they call me "Boss". Are you OK, Dad? Dad, please! Please, Dad! Let me explain to you. You don't have to explain anything! I need a Xanax. Dad, please. Dad! What do we do, David? Tell me. Well, we've got to go to hospital. He worked me over. It's open. - It's open? Shit. - Where is my stuff? - Pelame, Pelame, I know everything, you're fired. Come on, I'm kidding. What happened to you? Is it bad? - No. - Good, because I need you. - Where is my stuff? I'll explain to you. Come with me. It's not there anymore. You'll find it somewhere else. Here is the explanation. I thought you'd be more comfortable here. Since we have Villeneuve, my phone doesn't stop ringing. They all want to meet you. I don't want to go too fast, but I'm seriously thinking about having a new partner. And I'm starting to think that... I thought you wanted Brice as a partner. You're not interested? Yeah, yeah... No, I'm delighted. OK, we'll talk about it. Thank you. This is my office. You look ugly, Pelame. You too, Teller. Are we going to go on as if nothing happened? - Marion, don't start. - Fuck... I can't believe how you bothered me about drugs dangers, about all the shady guys while you were dealing. You took the piss out of us! - We didn't force anyone. - That's no excuse. There are things you can't understand! It's the crisis. - What do you know about crisis? I lost my job! I've been fired. In two minutes, like a bad person. So we had to find a solution, to be able to eat, heat the house, to live. And we thought about your future. Our future... So it's our fault? - I didn't say that. - Yes you did. The car and the UV machine, it's for my future? Fuck... You know what? It's over. No more Dad, no more Mum. You're not my parents anymore. Marion... Here you are, Pelame. Well... M. "Boss", that's it? - Yes. It's easy to remember. - See you later. - Pleased to meet you. - Me too. - OK, I'm leaving. Have a seat. Have a seat, I'm not going to hurt you. But that guy did. Let me see. Yeah... By the way, did I tell you he's my brother? Actually, we do it like you. We like to work with family. We had four days to... Don't worry. Now you have three weeks. However, you're going to take that. So, you owed me 18 000. Now with this new bag, you owe me 148 000. - That's impossible. - Why? How do you want us to... David... You're very talented, that's why I give you this. Say hello to your wife. Fuck... David, I can't talk to you, I'm going to meet Bidermann. "Boss" gave us a new bag. - What? - A second one! Calm down. - Can you hear me? - Yes. - How much do we have to sell? - I don't know! I didn't open the bag. All I know is that... We are in trouble. - It's OK, I'll see you at home. I have to go. - It's not a question of... - How are you? - Very well, thank you. Follow me please. Excuse me, I can't. Excuse me, excuse me. - I'm coming, David! - Miss Pelame? -Yes? - Hello. This is the police station. OK. You're lucky on that one. Hugo recognized he stole your skateboard, so the case is closed. But, don't do this again. If you do, one day you'll end up like them, hung to a radiator. Well, let's avoid traumatizing him. Your dear son broke Hugo's nose. Did you really do that? Yeah, but he got on my nerves. Listen to me. Your parents are good people. They are honest. You're honest, right? The same cannot be said for everybody. So, learn from them and stop mucking around. Yes, Mam. What did they do? They sold hashish. OK... What you did is wrong. Hitting people is bad. Shit! - He can defend himself. Hitting people is not defence, sorry. What is that? "Defend himself"... How was it with Bidermann? I don't think it's the right moment to... What do you mean? What? It didn't go well? - It's not that... - So what is it? How am I supposed to do with the job and the new bag? It's impossible. - What? These guys talk a lot but then, nothing. So, no Bidermann. You do exactly what you want. Don't talk to me like that in front of Romain. Look David... David! I'm the one who decides what I want. I do what I want, the way I want, I enjoy it! - You enjoy this life? - Yes! Because I feel alive! What about Boss? Well, as the taxes, we give him what we owe and we're good! And we'll get our share, which is still more than what "Bidersomething" offered. And how is "Miss logistics" going to pay her "taxes" in time? It's very simple. We must sell. You'll call our best clients and you'll motivate them. Do you realize what you're saying? You want me to force them? It's them or us David! Stop being prudish! Or call Boss, tell him you don't want to do this and we'll die... - No, I won't call Boss. - I'm cold, I'll be inside. "Call Boss"... Whatever... It's OK, sweetie. Don't worry, we'll get over it. Come on. Go ahead. - I'm not going to do this now. - You have to, David, please. Come on. 06, 12, 24, 38, 67. 24, 38, 67. It's Arthur. Don't stay here, it stresses me. - The list is here. - Yes. - 5 grams minimum. - You want to do it? - No. - Then leave me alone. - Not less than 5 grams. - Hello, it's Goliath. I'd like to talk to Arthur. The only thing I can tell you is that we talk about really good quality. So, if you want some, I can deliver within 24 hours. But below 5 grams, I can't do anything. I'm sorry. I write it down. Eight. It's all good. What about 12 grams? That way, you have some left. Jonathan? It's Goliath. Oh, sorry. Sorry, it's Goliath. Is Daddy there? Yeah... Yes, Eric. 5 grams. I don't sell below that. Emmanuel, here is how we'll do it: if you take 10 and Johnny 5, I'll give you 15 grams and you guys see that together? That way, it's easier for me. OK. What do you mean "you stop"? Olivier, it's not my concern, but your decision is pretty radical. Why don't you... You know, it's not perishable product. You can stock it and then use it whenever you want to. You can offer or share it. It's nice to have some at home. David? Is that you? Good evening, Christine. What are you doing here? You have a red mark here. I'll give you a massage. - No... - Turn around, it will hydrate. Turn around. Good. You're a little tense, aren't you? It's because of the due date, right? I can understand that. Between this new job, your husband, your children, it's normal to be stressed. But you must trust yourself. I can feel a lot of strength... a lot of determination in you. The clients... respect people like you. It feels good. I've... I've lost a 5 grams packet. I don't know what to do. 5 grams. It's annoying, 5 grams. We'll take that on your share. - OK. - Should we stop there? - Stop what? There. Yes. Oh yeah, I feel better. - Goodbye, Christine. - Goodbye. Just tell me if you want or not. Take a decision. Thank you. - Michel? - Can I come in? Sure. Have a seat. I'm sorry Michel. I totally lost my mind. I would understand if you didn't want to talk to me anymore. I think that if people pissed me off like they pissed you off, I would have done the same as you. You didn't do that in vain. Go ahead. - It's a client. It doesn't matter, I have plenty of time. Hello, yes? OK. Twelve? OK. - It's a hard work. - It's OK. Where were you? It won't be delivered by itself. Hold on. I sold drugs on the phone all day long. And yes, I had to work too, because I also have a real job. If we don't sell everything on time, you won't need your real job. You never cared about my job. No but we don't have a choice. If you have a solution, go ahead, for once. I was sceptical in the beginning, but you're right, we don't have a choice. What? - Michel. - What, Michel? No... - Come in. - No, no, no. Hold on, hold on. I don't want him to do this. Dad, you can't do this. Hold on, listen to me. - I refuse. - Look, what can I lose? - It's not the question. Then, you'll stop this. Dad, you can't start selling drugs. You know, I used to be a doctor. I'll prescribe different drugs now. I don't agree. That's how it is. So seat down and leave us alone. When do we start? - We can start tonight. - OK, let's go. You finish the orders. - Are you hungry? - Let's go eat something. I don't agree, I don't agree, I don't agree, I don't agree. Hello Goliath. Come. - Hello. I'm Attila. - Hello, Sir. - Attila? - How are you? - Here is your packet. - Thanks. You have a bad cough. Do it again. Cough. Cough again. You're not that good either. Do you sleep well? - Not really. You should take cocaine every 3 hours. And you should also eat fibre with this. A lot of it. Do your sums, maybe a listing. See how many of your friends want tube tickets, I'll supply the ticket books and you see that together. In that case, you can ride for free. Don't think one day at a time. Today is Wednesday, Friday will come fast. And maybe on Friday, it will be too late. It would be so bad. Jonathan, it's Goliath. Oh, I already called? No problem, sorry about that. - No! - Look, Dad... Here. - Come, I want to introduce you. - No, no... I'm in a hurry. I don't have time. Hey, this is Goliath. I told you about him. Excuse me. See you tomorrow, Pelame. Are you OK? Go ahead, start it up. Go ahead. What's wrong? Nothing. Damn... What, "damn"? What's the fucking problem? - I can't find it. - What? - A packet is missing. We don't care, it's just one packet. Your father might have taken it. So what? What? I remind you that you put him in this, so, stop that. - Stop talking to me like that. - What's your problem? I can't give my opinion anymore now. Take it easy. - Keep your voice down. I want to quickly get rid of this. - This is the goal. What is this mess? Shit! What did she do again? Marion! Is everything all right? Now please, get out of here! It's a vintage car! - Marion! Marion! You never had our permission for this! I don't give a shit! You're not my parents anymore, you're dealers! - Don't start! - It's full of clients. Go to your room! You can sell your drug now. Did you steal the packet? - What? - A packet is missing. I don't do drugs. You know what? I'm really happy. - Stop, go to your... - Because I know how to succeed in life: I'll do the opposite of you! Now, get out! That's enough. Everybody out, right now! Romain, you go upstairs. I said, upstairs! Your daughter slaps me and, as usual, you don't react. Do you think it's normal? Hey! Look at me! Shut up. Shut up. Don't tell me shut up. Don't talk to me like that! I do what I want. And I say shut up. Who kept selling this coke? Who? Who wanted to "enjoy"? Now, you see where we are. Who brought the coke here? For who did I do that? I didn't ask for! You never asked anything for 15 years! You're just complaining all the time. I don't care about that money! I wouldn't care either if I wasn't bored for 15 years. Well, let's just stop here. I don't want to talk to you. I can't stand you anymore. So, we'll finish this drug story and I leave, I'm out of here. I don't want to see you again. That's it, go ahead, get lost! Get out of here! I'll send you the contract with all the modifications. How long will this audit take? Sorry, what? How long, for the audit? Oh, well... Actually, it would be... It has to be... Excuse me, what was the question? The audit... How long? I would say... Well, if we really... Well, first, I have to read the file. - Is there a problem? - No. I think three weeks is a good period. It's too long. Two weeks. Sorry, but you closed the blind so I couldn't tell you that I have the file on the narcotic case we talked about yesterday. Sorry about that. Can we go on? - I'll be back. - We don't have time. What do you want from me? What do you think, Pelame? - I don't know. - You're clever. - No, I'm not. - You're not? - No, you tell me that every day. Go tell everything to Dalambert. You don't have any proof. Now get out of here. - Are you done? Yes, I'm done. - Where did you find that? - It's my Dad's. - Is it real stuff? - Yeah. - Your Dad's a dealer? - Yeah. Wow... How much is it? I don't know, around 400. - Euros? - Yeah. It looks like my little brother's powder milk. - Your brother takes coke? - You're really stupid. Hello Goliath, I'm glad you are here. Hello. How are you? - You've got the money? - Of course, come in. I just want to tell you something. I don't want to mess with you but I called 200 times, you never answered. Do you do this to all your clients? Do you know who I am? No, you don't who I am. I'm just a guy who wanted his coke, OK? You thought I was going to buy it and say nothing about it? I want some respect, OK? Give me the coke. Give me the coke. - Give him. Hello. - Where is it from? - I don't know. Did you taste it? You didn't? Wait, have you ever taken coke? Answer my question! No, never. Prepare a line. Move there. Back up! Come on, take it. - Go ahead. No, I can't. - Yes you can. Don't move. - No, I can't. Of course you can. Go ahead. Block one nostril. There. There you go. Go ahead. Prepare two more lines. - That's enough! - You stay there, OK? Go ahead. A last one. - What about us? - Leave her alone. - Shut up. What's this? OK, my turn. It was a joke, it's not loaded! It was a joke! Little fucker! OK, let's go, let's go! Let's go. - Stop! Stop! - Stop, stop, let's go, let's go! - Let's go, let's go. - Little fuckers! I'm sorry.

There is a letter for you. A surprise. Bye, Pelame. - Shit. - Who was it, David? Who was it? Who was it? David? David! Who was it? - Nothing. - What? It's not under the doormat.

David, I want to tell you something. I never had the occasion, but now I can, so I'll tell you: David, you're attractive. - Christine, watch the road! Please watch the road. You've always been attractive. I don't know why I never told you. I feel bad. I should have told you. When I look at you in your suit... Your suit is nice, but I think you are nicer. I think you're very attractive. - Where are we going? - I don't know. Where are we going? Where are we going? David, where are we going? Take a right here. You never answer the phone! I'm looking for Brice. Hey, do you know Lola's address? - Lola's address? Why? She's here. Where is Brice? Hey. Would you like a line? No, I'm asking you where Brice is. Calm down! He's working. Why are you all looking for him? Naomi? Naomi? Did she take anything? - A bunch of stuff. Wait. Michel I need you, please come up. She has to stand up. She has to walk. Come on, walk. Water, bring me water. Come on, walk. Go ahead, David. Is my water coming? Let's go to my office. Wait for me. Brice? Brice? So? That kind of service will cost you a third bag. - No, I can't anymore. I'm tired. - There won't be a third bag. David, this guy is a parasite. I have big projects for you. - Leave him alone now! - Slowly or you'll end up like him. So what? You'll get three dead bodies and a third bag. You want to do business, OK. I'll buy this man. Did you see his eyes? There was a lot of conviction in it. It's good, uh? So, how much? Well, let him go. How much? 10 000. 20 000 euros. - No. - Yes. Christine, I know he's a clown, but hey, not 20 000. Uh? How much do we have? We have 41 324. 41 324. It's not enough, actually. What do you think? I need something more. So, what? You want the house? I'll give you the house. No, I don't want your house. It's too big for me. No. There is something that I would like. I know you love it, but I do too. I really want it. I want it so bad. Your vintage car. Here. Thank you. Goodbye, Christine. Goodbye. Christine! Wait, wait. It's going to hurt. Ouch, sorry! "My life is unbearable" Thank you, David. Thank you, thank you Pelame. - Are you OK? - Hello, gentlemen. - Good evening. - I know you. - Exact, how are you? - M. Boss! - That's it. - You see, I remember. - You're a thinker. Yes, yes. Don't tell me Pelame is still working now? He is! He's a killer... Dad... Dad, you have to come downstairs. You have to come. - M. Pelame, we have to talk. - I'm coming. Honey, I've got to go to work. I'll talk to you later. - Follow us. - Shh... OK, let's get out this way. That way is noisy. Move this away from us. I'll be all right. It's OK, don't worry. You take care of him. My dear son had a great idea: sell a few grams to his best friends. David! David! Unfortunately for me, one of them told it to his parents. But luckily for me, it was the very last packet we had. So, I've been convicted only for drug use. Thanks to Brice, I received a suspended sentence. However, the judge ordered a therapy to cure my supposed addiction. Good evening. I am David Pelame. Good evening, David. - Welcome. - Thank you. Who wants to talk tonight? Yes? Hello my friends, my name's Emmanuel I'm a drug addict. - Hello, Emmanuel. The good news, when I arrived here, is that I quickly solved my drug problem. The bad news is that it wasn't a drug problem. The problem was me. I took a lot of powder. It almost killed me and I loved it. I've got to be dumb. Thanks to you, I relearned everything. David! Are you OK? - Yeah. - How did it go? - Like I was expecting. We all talked about our experience. Some of them went through hard situations. - Were there former clients? - No. - Good, good. - Hey, we're waiting for you. - We're coming. - So? - It went well. Yes, very well. Where do we go? - To Mexican. - We said pizza. Marion! -We said pizza. Tacos are like pizzas folded in two. Not at all, Mum. And I want a burger. No, you can have burger only once a week. When are you going to sell this car? My car is perfect. I like it like this. What about a Greek sandwich? - Oh no! No... - Dad? - Michel... Oh, come on... What do you mean "you stop"? Olivier, it's not my concern, but your decision is pretty radical. Why don't you... You know, it's not perishable product. You can stock it and then use it whenever you want to. You can offer or share it. It's nice to have some at home. Now, I have some. Tomorrow, I don't know. This is how I think. OK. Not below 5 grams, I'm repeating myself. Subtitles: RED BEE MEDIA FRANCE
