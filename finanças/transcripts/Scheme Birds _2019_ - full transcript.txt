(SIREN WAILING) (PHONE CLICKING) (DRAMATIC ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) GEMMA: Everybody's gettin' into something. I don't run away from nothing. I run to it. (LIGHT ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) I'm Gemma. I'm from Jerviston, in Motherwell, and over years since I was born, there's been so much fighting. (ALL SHOUTING) (CAR HORN HONKING) But what everyone gives us credit for is because we never ran, we always stood. GIRL: You're so good. GEMMA: We get called Scheme Birds. (LIGHT ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) This is the scheme where I live. A scheme is like a non-snobby place to stay. (KIDS CHATTERING) You could pick anything in the world. You could move to Ibiza, you could move here, you could move there. No, I live here. BOY: Gemma! Take it over the Craig! GEMMA: That's what we're doing, stupid! BOY: Who the fuck are you calling stupid, you cunt! GEMMA: You! If you stay here, you either get locked up or knocked up. But I don't think I'll ever move out. I think I'll stay here the rest of my whole life. I hope so. I hope I do. I don't want to fly the nest anytime soon. (ALL SHOUTING) That little guy got heavy smashed. (LAUGHING) That got captured in slow-motion and everything. (LAUGHING) (ALL SHOUTING) Lift her head up with her hair and start banging it off the ground. See most lasses, man, they fight with grabbing hair. You fight with your fists, Gemma. I don't even give them a chance to grab my hair, man. Imagine someone did that in Jervi, man? They'd get fucking stabbed the fuck out of. Fuck the Queen, fuck the Pope. GEMMA: Don't fuck the Pope, you cunt. Fuck the Queen! Yeah, the Queen's a bean. GEMMA: All cops are bastards. BOY: They are, aren't they? Come on, keep going. Time! Right, Gemma, up here. Gemma! GEMMA: That's my Grandpa. My Papa's brought me up since I was a baby. Bang, bang, bang. You got the ring. See, if you move, and I'm boxing you, If I'm boxing you, I'm going there, and you're doing the running. I'll no tire. You'll tire. GEMMA: Okay. So you take them up by the ring. GEMMA: My mum and dad were really young when they had me. But I've never met my mum since I was a small baby. MAN: Stop and you're in a bind. Stop. Anywhere you go... GEMMA: I know it sounds bad, but I don't want to meet her anymore. I didn't need her for 18 years, and she didn't need me, so... Right, watch it. Duck your head and go the opposite way. Right, go. Watch your slip. If you leave like that, somebody'll just swoop in there, bump in the ribs. It'll put you down on your knees. Lovely. Better. That's better. GEMMA: People around here get into trouble. Papa doesn't like it at all. Because it's quite a kick in the teeth when he's bringing everybody to the boxing gym, and teaching them that, and then they go and get in trouble with the police and, God knows who else. Go on! Go on! (BEEPING) Magic. Another one, and I'll have you up here, Gemma. GEMMA: But he likes his pigeons. (LIGHT ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) I think he likes the pigeons better than he likes most people. Rather than sitting in the house worrying about a thing, you could water them or feed them, and it takes your mind off it for half an hour. Which is a blessing, isn't it? If other people haven't got a hobby or aren't into anything, it could eat away at you. All right (WHISTLING) Come on! (WHISTLING) Come on! (WHISTLING) Come on! (WHISTLING) WOMAN: Honey, I'm home! Come on! (WHISTLING) Come on. (WHISTLING) Come on, all right, I won't touch you. Come on. (WHISTLING) Come on. Babies are babies. They're growing all the time. So you've got to make a bond with them. Fuck off. Samuel. Fuck off! Samuel, you're doing my fucking head in! I'm not even doing fuck all, am I? (LAUGHING) Samuel, fuck off! Fucking go home! No, don't fucking even try it. Just don't even speak to me. Samuel, fuck off! You fucking asshole! Fucking shut your mouth! Get your ass in, you fucking minger! Right, troops, I'm out. Chicken! Away you go, you smelly bastards! (PHONE RINGING) Wanna slide that for me? Aye, aye. Hello. Aye, Papa. All right, I'll come up soon then, right? Okay, that's fine. Okay, bye, bye. Am I the judge? No, through the wire first with them, and then, after that, handling. Roll it, yeah. Right, the next one. (PIGEONS COOING) GEMMA: Every Friday in the boxing gym, they have a pigeon show. And they decide which bird is the most beautiful. A lot of them are just random men. They think that the pigeons keep people out of jail and out of trouble and stuff. (BLOWING) That's it. Right, Gemma, come over and have a look. He's taken them out, Kelly. I wouldn't put them on that. Let's see what you think. That's the nicest one there out of them all. I think that 39's the nicest one of them all. But handling is different from through the wire. If you handle that pigeon, and you handle those pigeons, you'll see the difference. MAN: Which pigeon is it? GEMMA: Snowball! MAN: The winner. That stands nicer than everything. What, that stands nicer? Oh yeah, definitely. WOMAN: 'Cause that one's not had time out the basket, that's what the thing is. MAN: That's a cracker. WOMAN: If that got into the environment, it would have stood better. Three times down to France. MAN: Over the top of its head, that's it. GEMMA: Our pigeons have been all over the world. You let them out and they find their way back home. Most of them, at least. Fly, babies! Fly! Now I'm going to tell you something. (LIGHT ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) So this is how it all started. Once, we were called Steelopolis. We supplied the whole world with steel. Everybody worked there. And my gran worked there. A lot of my family. When the steelworks was there, Motherwell was thriving. Maggie Thatcher, she took all the steelworks in Scotland and Ireland for England. We're the party of the whole United Kingdom. (AUDIENCE APPLAUDING) GEMMA: The English hated the Scottish, and suddenly, it was shut down. She put a lot of people out of work. I don't know why. (EXPLOSION BOOMING) The same year I was born, 1997, the steelworks was blown up. The sky turned gray. Motherwell didn't really have much left after that. We still have nothing to do. (KIDS CHATTERING) (LIGHT ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) MAN: Wanna play stab for a stab, like we used to, Scott? (ALL CHATTERING) GEMMA: This is Pat. Right, I'm fucking top boy, you all know it! This young guy, he's under my wing. BOY: And who's top bird? ♪ Top bird's Gemma Gillon, Gemma G from the JYT ♪ ♪ Don't fuck with her or she'll get a hommie ♪ Yeah, man! PAT: Drunkies, guilty!

Right, catch your breath. Walk around a bit. Fill your lungs up again. In through your nose. In through your nose with it. Keep walking. You listening? It's better to box in here, train in here, take your frustration out in here, rather than out there, and hurting somebody. In here's the best place. Stay away from all the idiots out there. Come to the gym more often. Do your thing in here, but stay away from all the people with drink and drugs. Keep away from them. GEMMA: Can I answer my phone, Papa? Do your thing. Hurry up. Let me see that. GEMMA: Hello? Hey, Pat. Hello? MAN: We don't want more time. I want this finished... Yeah, I'm at boxing. MAN: Come on. (DOOR CLICKING) Look at this.

Well, they came to the door. And said she had been arrested for shoplifting or something. She had a drug problem. Social workers got involved and they contacted us.

I was always jumping about fighting with people, gang fighting and that, and obviously, I got the jail, and I did a sentence for battering somebody, and then I got out. Then I had a girlfriend who killed herself, and then I met Gemma. And I was obviously depressed out of my mind and all that, and then I met Gemma, and obviously, hey it is, man, what changed us and that man. Then I ended up getting to jail again. I got out and found out she was pregnant. It's like, I'm happy now. I'm fuckin', I don't do anything criminal any more. I used to be a thug, but I've got a baby now. It's changed me. And that's that. Watch yourself, watch yourself. There, good boy. (LIGHT ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) GEMMA: The first day I came in, I was a little bit afraid, 'cause the wind goes by so fast, it's like, I dunno, screaming, and it makes you feel as if the tower's shaking.

(LAUGHING) I used to fight with a lot of people, 'cause they used to always ask about my mum. "Why did she leave you?" Stuff like that. So instead of answering them, I hit them. I couldn't bring myself to say why my mum left me. I didn't want to believe it. Look at how big his hands are. He's got big enough hands to be a boxer, doesn't he? Yeah, but he's going to be a football player. Or a kickboxer. (LIGHT ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) GEMMA: He's a wee dick, isn't he? I was going to punch him. You would've hidden from yourself if you had seen you last night. I was pure steaming. You wanna come in, I don't know, you were walking out here, knocking on this door, "Is JP there?" "No, Amy, I've told you three times, he's not here." Walked out there... GEMMA: This is Amy. And she seems to have no luck. Once she got caught on camera.

GEMMA: Yeah, it's a murder. There were two motors and two vans there. They went in with forensic bags. The last time it was a murder, it was only an ambulance and one motor... GEMMA: Something more then. Double homicide. There's always something going on 'round here. You know what it's like. What time's the party starting? What, tomorrow? Seven. JP: Seven? Mm-hmm. Not bad. GEMMA: This is JP. He's one of my good friends. The first time we met, he gave me a full liter of vodka, and then left me over the Craig and forgot about me and the vodka. And I was pure lost in my own scheme. Oh well. JP: Pat's pure lazy, ain't he? A bit tired cause he's got a baby. Doing the night feeds and everything. GEMMA: And he also loves Amy. It's all the way around. (LAUGHING) What? You're dead funny in the morning. PAT: Shut up. Oh, where's my other coffee by the way, Pat, eh? Fucking, you've drunk it, ain't you? PAT: No. Well, where is it then? What? No, not that coffee. PAT: I put it over there, obviously, to get washed. All right! It's all right, I'll come down. I'll bring him down now, all right?

(ALL CHATTERING) (DRAMATIC ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) A boy of 16 is in a serious condition at hospital after an alleged attack in Coronation Park, Motherwell, in the early hours of Monday morning. A police spokesman said that the 16-year-old boy had been seriously injured following a disturbance in the play park. He was taken by ambulance to the local hospital, but has been transferred to the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow. Park entrances in Jerviston Street and Park Street have been cordoned off, and police are still present at the crime scene this morning. John Paul Morrison, know as JP, of Allan Tower, suffered a serious head injury during the incident. He is currently in a coma, and medical staff described his condition as serious. Inquiries into the incident are continuing. Just blood. And then blood came out his mouth. His face was fucked. If you'd have seen him, Gemma, it was terrible. GEMMA: Were there bruises and that? His two eyes were purple. His ear was black. They booted the ear right off him. Burst lips, his lips were away out to here. And then his head. Yeah, he had a big scar. The two sides of his head were out like that. They had to obviously remove half his skull to remove that pressure. I touched his right side and said, can you feel that? He said, "Yeah, I can feel that no problem". Then I touched his left side and said, can you feel that? And he was like, "No". I was like, can you feel that at all? He said, "No, I can't even feel anything." It's shocking what they done to the boy. That's the big boys that can do that to a fucking young boy. You know what I mean? They're fucking, come on, all the beefs. That's what they want, isn't it? That's what the two of them want. They want the jail, ain't it? I've said to everybody, if Scott doesn't go to jail for doing a murder, he'll be murdered, am I right? AMY: Yeah, definitely. For what he's doing to people and things like that. (DRAMATIC ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) GEMMA: Do you remember Scott? The one we were playing TV games with? He was the one who attacked JP. I don't know why they did it. And I don't think they know either. It was just a stupid fight. Double chin. Tiny double chin! This could happen to anybody. But it should not have happened to JP. (GASPING) (LAUGHING) AMY: That shitty toilet that they have. GEMMA: This is Maria. This is JP's mum. MARIA: It was a Sunday night. John Paul went in next door to Gemma's. He came back through again. Just popped his head in and said to Amy, "Right, let's go". And that was the last I saw him. Then at three in the morning, the door went, with the inspector, the police. They said that John Paul had been horrifically attacked. But I didn't think it was that serious. I made a coffee and had a fag. I phoned the hospital. They said, "You need to come right away". I went in and I just looked at him, and I started screaming. And a nurse, Kelly, I'll never forget her. She took me to the side and said, "Give yourself 10 minutes, "and I'll bet you you're back in at his side "and you won't leave him." And she was right. I held his hand and kept whispering into his ear. "Fight, just fight for me, JP. "Come on, son. "Don't leave me. "You're 16. "You can't leave me". I'll take care of him. Till the day I die. He'll never be out of my sight. Nobody will ever harm him again. (DRAMATIC ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) Right. JP: Take that one off. MARIA: The gammy one? You need to help me, right? JP: All right, I'll try. MARIA: Right, in with this one first. Right, my darling, there you are. Here's this one. JP: My laces are all stuck out. MARIA: That's all right. Is it too much? JP: I'll just try and do it when my foot is on the ground? MARIA: Right, try it this way then. Right, there you go. Is that it in? MARIA: That's it in. Do you like them? Yeah, they're belters. MARIA: Smashing, aren't they? Yeah. MARIA: Do you want to stand up? No, not right now. MARIA: Push your foot in. No, it's in. MARIA: You sure? Yeah, I'm sure. (DOOR SQUEAKING) MARIA: Hiya. Hi. JP: Watch that fag ash on the floor, yeah? MARIA: He's been desperate for you to come down. I know. MARIA: Desperate. WOMAN: Here, this is what I was telling you about. About the, in the newspaper. Aye. JP: I don't think I've seen it. MARIA: Have you not seen that? JP: No. MARIA: Show John Paul. That's what was in the Motherwell Times, son. "John Paul, who is known as JP, "underwent surgery at Queen Elizabeth "University Hospital in Glasgow. "His grandmother, Sadie Morrison, broke "news of the alleged attack on her Facebook page. "She asked friends to pray for John Paul, 'saying he was in a coma after getting a bad kicking." 12 full weeks you were in there. It was terrible. I thought my life was over, watching you. JP: I thought mine was over. Lying a bag of bones in a bed. They kept saying to me, "I can't answer that". But at one point, did they tell you I wasn't going to die? MARIA: Yeah, at the end, but they told me you still weren't out the woods yet. And then, if you did pull through, you would be more or less a vegetable. Oooft. And look at you today. You've still got a life. Not really. MARIA: You can't walk, you're paralyzed on the lefthand side, but... WOMAN: You're here, John. MARIA: You're here. I know. MARIA: And the brain damage, I'd like to know where it is, because you're as sharp as anything. You're amazing. And I'll keep telling you that, you're amazing. Stop telling me then, all right? (CHUCKLING) MARIA: Yeah, but, you're my miracle, so you are. What a lovely night, isn't it? JP: Yeah, it looks nice. MARIA: It does, it looks as if it could snow. WOMAN: Yeah, it is. MARIA: Yeah, it's beautiful. (LIGHT ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) So it is. Do you need a hand, dear? AMY: No, it's all right, I'm just having a wee look. WOMAN: Is it you that's pregnant? Aye. WOMAN: Oh, congratulations. Thank you! WOMAN: Is that your first? Aye. WOMAN: Do you know what you're having? Not yet. It's my next scan I find out. WOMAN: Oh, right. How far on are you? Three-and-a-half months. WOMAN: That's lovely. Are you looking forward to it? Aye, dead excited. I can't wait to find out if it's a boy or a girl. WOMAN: It's hard to buy for if you don't know the sex. Do you sell anything white? WOMAN: We've got little white outfits up there. What would you prefer? A wee girl or a wee boy? A wee girl, but I think I'll get a boy. Just my luck. Everything happens for a reason. When JP was in the hospital, he was in for a good four, four-and-a-half months. I was getting told that it was finished and I had to move on. So I automatically thought, like, that was that, we had broke up. So I'm moving on, then I met somebody, and then I found out I was pregnant to this person. But he's not in my life any more. And he won't be in the baby's either. (DRAMATIC ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) We loved each other, know what I mean? When that happened to him. It would be better if it was the three of us. Me, JP, and the baby. But obviously, it's not going to be that. So now, I'm on my own. It's been five months since that happened to JP, and I heard that he's just got home from the hospital. I've never seen JP since. I don't think, it's not out of badness, but I don't want to see him, 'cause I want to remember him the way he was. It plays on my mind a lot. (DRAMATIC ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) (LINE RINGING) Oh, you answer? Where are you? I was meant to meet you and you're out with everybody else. I can't be bothered with you any more. Yeah, I hope your pals will be good enough for you, all right? I just kind of woke up and thought to myself, I don't want to be with you any more. Know what I mean? And then it was like I told him. I'm just saying, he's not ideal. He's not somebody that you... AMY: He's not dad material. Aye, exactly. AMY: He's got too much of a... Drain brain? BOTH: Aye. AMY: Just because he thought that he could still go out and party and everything else. Stay out until all hours of the morning. Aye, and bring a team to the house. No, I doubt it. AMY: Just no respect. No respect at all. So, leave it where you find it. Aye. Everything's fucked up these days, ain't it? Aye. But it's all getting better, know what I mean? You're getting on with your life, just you and the baby... Exactly. And you can't lead them on when you don't love them... You might as well just get it out there, you know what I mean? But he knew for a while anyway. He knew it was coming, definitely. Pat can see Liam when he's off the drink, off the drugs, and all the rest of it. Until then, he's seeing nobody. AMY: He's got too may problems. But, there's no going back to that. You know what I mean? I'm done with that situation. I'll never go back there, man. I promise myself that. (BABY COOING) (GROWLING) Is that your girlfriend? Is that your girlfriend? (DRAMATIC ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) (SIREN WAILING) (DOG BARKING) (CROWD CHEERING) I fell out with my family over my boyfriend. And then I fell out with my boyfriend. So you know what? I've nothing to lose. Not any more. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) (DOOR CLICKING) Hiya, Maria. MARIA: Hiya, darling. Is JP in? Yeah, he is. Good to see you. Really, really good to see you. I knew you'd be found. Come on, my darling. Right come on, in you come. GEMMA: JP! What's happening? I've missed you. How have you been? Not bad. No, I got it. Have you got a little dog now? Yeah, it's up at my Gran's. He's a belter. What's his name? Charlie. Charlie? Yeah. How have you been? All right? Yeah, all good. I'll need to come down more and see you. Do you like staying in this house? JP: No, it's freezing, man. - Is it? - Aye. Got a fire behind that couch, but... Was it warmer higher up? Aye, 'cause the heat rises in towers. That's when I just come out of a coma. Is that a neck brace you've got on? Is that you just out of it? I had just woke up. When did you actually start coming round and stuff? When I went into Wishaw General. GEMMA: Where was the hospital you got moved to, the intensive care one? Glasgow? Aye, it was in Glasgow. All I want to know is what they hurt us with. I can't even remember. I was sleeping for a full week, and then I got woken up to all this. What happened when you woke up? What made you wake up? Was it the voices of your family? Or did you just come around? I was on mad sedation. They just started taking me off it, and then I just woke up slowly. I was fucked for ages, man. I've just come round there. Aye. (MUTTERING) I couldn't even spell at one point. Fucked altogether. Remember down by the river when we were mad with it, JP? (LAUGHING) JP: That was too funny, man. I went on with a bottle down my jacket on one of the rollercoasters and forgot to put the lid on. I was soaking, man. And I was like, see if that falls out and hits me on the back of the head. JP: It was right good down there, man. Aye. JP: Mad with it... We've got some memories though, JP. Remember I did your makeup in that tent? Can you remember? JP: Yeah, in that staircase, oooft. GEMMA: Good memories, so we did. So we do. MARIA: I think it's great. A bad experience, coming out of it, it's gonna be good. GEMMA: Sad, everything that's happened. It's all come... It's all come to a nice ending, I think. So it has. You haven't half turned your life round. Listen to him! He is some boy, but you're more than welcome to come down and have a chat with John Paul. GEMMA: Good. I've enjoyed today. MARIA: Definitely. It's life now. You just need to get on with it. He's got a good family. MARIA: Aye, definitely. And so have you. I know. You went through a lot as well, so you have. GEMMA: Yeah. MARIA: I know, 24 hours a day I've got him, but I wouldn't have it any other way. I love him to bits. He's a different boy. JP: I'm here! MARIA: Completely different. As you know, he was a little shit before. GEMMA: He had his moments. He did! That's what I was going to say. 'Cause I saw him that night before he left, and he was perfect. And less than six hours later, he was nearly dead. So you protect your son. Because within a split second, it can all change in. You're all right, though. And you're a great mommy. Thank you. So are you. Amazing. As good as they come. (DRAMATIC ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) Aye, he's a good boy. I just wish that hadn't happened. GEMMA: So do we all. Aye, aye. but, onwards and upwards, darling. I try my best. GEMMA: JP's never gonna be the same. There's no coming back from that now. That's him for the rest of his life. I didn't want to see that happening to him. He's a fucking baby at the end of the day. He's only 16. MAN: What is a baby? It can be tame or it can be wild to you as a baby, but as it gets older, you can tame them, know what I mean? Babies are babies. Some are wild, as in they won't come near you. They'd be wary of you. Other ones will come up to you and grab you by the hand. You don't know. They can be here today and gone tomorrow. (PIGEONS COOING) GEMMA: The pigeons fly all over the world. Some of them come to England. And then, most of them always make it home. But some of them just fly off and do their own thing. Some of the birds fly off, never to come back. (DRAMATIC ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) I'm leaving now. I had to leave. Amy had a baby and just grew up, the same as the rest of us. MARIA: Not even cold, is it? No, it's roasting. Hopefully, this is the start of the summer. Charlie! We should do this every day. GEMMA: Scott got eight years. Me and Pat don't see each other any more. When it was good, it was good, but then it just went down the drain. Pat hasn't seen Liam for one year. (WHISTLING) Come on. GEMMA: My Papa's just missing me. MAN: Come on. (WHISTLING) GEMMA: Too close a family to move away and not talk and everything, it's stupid. You don't do that, not to your family. You're meant to all be together. I'll see Joseph soon. I want him to know my son. All the towers in Motherwell are going to be getting taken down. Demolished, so that they can build more houses. They're gonna blow them up. It's gonna take 20 years, and then there should be no towers left in the North Lanarkshire area. In 20 years, it's all gonna be gone. What? Like, what do I feel? Standing on stones? I don't know, I've been through a hell of a lot to be the way I am now. Keep going! Keep going! I think I'm doing good. Yay! (LINE RINGING) Hello, is this Monty's Café? Yeah, could I speak to the boss or the manager, please? Hello, I actually applied for a job online and it's just to see if any word's back? Gemma Gillon. 10-13-1997. Yeah. Yeah, that's fine. Yeah, I've just moved from Scotland to England. Yeah. I'm smart, hard working, I'm loyal, reliable, I have good timekeeping. Yeah, I'm trustworthy. Yeah. Okay, thank you. Bye. Yay, Mum's going to get a job. (LIGHT ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) Is that all you've got? Punch it! Go. Oh, come on! Get a wee combo, go. Wow.
