VHS. Now then. Now then. Get a move on or we'll miss the bus. Hold your horses. Rome weren't built in a day you know. Nor you neither. Come along now. One minute. Until I put the key under the mat for Annie. Did you leave a note for the milkman? That's all been attended to. Come along. Are you a burglar? I suppose so. I have just stolen a couple of very valuable eggs. You don't look like a burglar. Thanks. That is probably the secret of my success. Do you carry a gun? No. Well, in that case I will be running along. No. Don't go. Please don't. Say, what is this? What are you scared of? Nothing. Then why don't you want me to go? Oh, I don't know. I'd like to know more about you. That's all. It isn't usual to find a man in a dinner jacket eating eggs at your dinner table. Is it? I suppose it isn't. But I can explain that in three words. I was hungry. Then why are you dressed like that? Because it's all I've got. It is better than going around in a barrel. I'm sorry about the eggs but it couldn't be helped. Now listen. You've broken into my house and I've been quite nice about it so far. But I can call the police, you know. Unless you behave yourself. You know. I think I am beginning to like you. That's good. Give me that key. Next time you feel like getting tough. Pick on someone your own size. Don't go. Please. I really am scared. I need someone to help me. Come in. Sit down and finish your meal. Okay. Do you like tea? - Not much. I'm sorry but it's all I have got. Alright. I'll take it. You are an American, aren't you? How did you guess? - You are so direct. You come straight to the point. I like that. I often wish I could do it myself. Well. Why not make a stab at it? Right now. I wish I could. But. I was brought up a little differently. I have to feel my way first. You see, my father was a diplomat. I have heard of them. I think we have a couple some place in Washington. Have you been in England long? - Three years. Forgive me for asking. But... Now your own country is in the war too, I should think you'd want to go back. I am way ahead of you, sister. I have my ticket right here. I am sailing in a few days to join up with one of our own outfits. I'm glad. That makes me feel a little better about you. It took every penny I could beg, borrow or steal. It's all I've got. Haven't you any friends? - I had one. My partner. What happened to him? - He went out in a cloud of poker chips. You see. We ran a little gambling joint just off Shaftesbury Avenue. And in the last air raid we were blown out. I was left with nothing but my work clothes. So you are a gambler? - Uhuh. But this time I lost. The works. You... You like to gamble? Naturally. That's why I do it. Do you believe in miracles? - Not much. I saw a seven come once ten times in a row on a pair of dice in St Louis. But they were loaded. What is your name? Daniel Shane. Mr Shane? - Hmm? I have a proposition to make to you. You do what I ask and... I'll stake you to a new suit of clothes and all you may need on your voyage. Is that fair? Well. It depends on what you want me to do. Come upstairs and I'll show you. Okay. In there. Did you do it? No. But no-one will ever believe me if he's found here. Do you believe me? What's that got to do with the price of rubber? Nothing. Alright then. What do you want me to do? Take him out of here. Take him out of this house. How much time have we got? As long as you like. How about the servants? They won't be back until Monday. Who is this guy? What's that got to do with the price of rubber? Okay, sister. I guess I left myself wide open for that one. Did he have an overcoat? Yes. There. On the chair. You'd better turn your back. This isn't going to be pleasant. What are you going to do? - Take out the knife. How much is this worth to you? Ten pounds. Make it fifteen. Alright. Fifteen. You'd better get the money now. I'll need some for the cab. Want any help, sir? No thanks. I am used to it. Steady on, sir. Easy now. My word, he is drunk. Ain't he, sir. Dead drunk if you ask me. You know. This poor fellow. He never could hold his liquor. It always goes to his feet. Take me. I am just like a sponge. Look. I'll go round. I'll go round and put him into the seat. You take care of his legs for him. Alright. Up we go. My word. He is cold, sir. You had better take him home and give him a hot toddy. A good idea. Now then, what's all this? It's alright, officer. Just a little regimental dinner. Indeed? What regiment may I ask, sir? What regiment? Did you say, what regiment? - Yes, sir. That is what I said. A fine detective you would make, Robert. I don't think. What's the matter with your eyes? I dare say my eyes are as good as yours, Mr Hawkins. Then take a look at his blooming tie. I beg your pardon, sir. A very fine regiment, sir. Thumbs up. Thumbs up. Goodnight, sir. - Goodnight. Drive on. Where to, sir? The tube station at Queen's Gate. - Very good, sir. There you are, driver. I say, sir. Is that the smallest you got? I'm afraid it is. You can get some change at the ticket desk downstairs. Can I give you a hand with His Nibs, sir? No thank you. He's coming to now. You run along and get the change. - Very good, sir. Now then my sleeping beauty. Arise. Where are you going? - I ain't going nowhere, nosy. London was good enough for my father and it's good enough for me. Well, what do you want? - I want change for that. Ah. You must have come into a blooming fortune, ain't you. What did you do? Kill your poor old grandmother? - Now then, none of your lip. Or I'll jump through this little hole and throttle you in your den. It's blokes like you what causes all the troubles in the world. Always asking favours and giving nothing in return. Cheer up, Ronald. I may drop around some Sunday and take you for a ride in the open air. What a rumour. Ha. Cabby. Oh. Here you are, sir. Hey. Thank you very much, sir. Where is His Nibs? He's just telephoning his wife. I wouldn't be in his boots for all the rice in China. Neither would I. - Goodnight, sir. Hey, open up in there. Well? It's me again. - Who are you? What? I said, who are you? What do you mean by making this disturbance at my door? So, that is the way it is. Now I've done you a favour you're going to give me the brush-off. Is that it? I haven't the slightest idea what you're talking about. And unless you leave this house at once I shall send for the police. Now, listen. I stuck my neck out for you last night. If you think you can treat me like one of your hired monkeys... You got another think coming. - Go away. Please go away. I'll go when I'm good and ready. What more do you want? Why you come back? A lot of things. My boat doesn't leave for a few days. You know. I took quite a shine to you the moment I saw you. You are a little different. A little out of the run to what I am used to. I dare say. I'd like to know what makes a dame like you tick. To kill a man like that and then hire another man to take him away. Just as if he were an old mail sack. Then you do think I did it? - Sure. Of course, I don't think it was premeditated or anything like that. You are not the type. I suppose you are what the magazines would call 'a lady'. You go off suddenly like a pineapple. And expect someone else to pick up the pieces. You cheap good-for-nothing tramp. Get out of here. You see, that's exactly what I mean. I bet they've never seen you like that when you are out in public. You've got a Tiffany front. With a hock shop behind it. I can see through you like cellophane. I think we've had quite enough of this window shopping. Don't you? Unless you go now I'll call the police. Yes. You would. Hello? Get me the police. Hello. Is this the police? I want to report that a man has... You little fool. Do you realize what you are doing? Perfectly. - Yes. You do. If you call the cops they will take you to jail. They might even put a rope around that pretty neck of yours. If I have to choose between you and the police. I will choose the police. Okay. If I am as bad as that, let's just forget it. Oh. Do you need some more money? Take it easy, sister. That last crack was a little low. Even for a lady. Come back. Come back quick. There. Upstairs. In the study. Feeling better? Hmm. Did you... Did you see? Yeah. What are we going to do now? I don't know what you are going to do, sister. But I am going to scram. [ Door knocks ] Second floor. Open up. Here is your chance. - What do you mean? You said you preferred the cops. Let them in. Make up your mind. I've made it. - What is it? No cops. [ Door knocks ] Come on. Open this door. Well? Where are they? - I don't know, sir. That is what I was going to ask you. Where do we go from here? - I've a cousin who lives at Abbington. I thought if I could get to him he may be able to help me. Where is Abbington? An overnight journey I'm afraid. Don't be afraid. After all, I am with you. That is what I am afraid of. The name seems to be 'Shane', sir. Daniel Shane. By the way. Who are you anyway? Does that matter? It might be nice to have a name to call you. I want to call you. My name is Stafford. Leslie Stafford. Leslie. For a dame? Why not? It is quite common in England. Well, I suppose it is better than calling you Butch. 'Fisherman's Rest'. How about this? I suppose it will do as well as any. You cannot do that, Angus. Who says I cannot do it? I've done it. Nevertheless, you cannot do it. Not according to Hoyle. - And who is Hoyle? Hoyle is the man who says you cannot do it. He wrote a book about it. Now look here, Jock. It's you I am playing with and not Hoyle. I am sorry to interrupt your game but could you put us up for the night? And how long have you been standing there? You see what you have done? You've taken my mind off my business. Will you come this way, sir. Please. Don't you think we'd better put the car away? After all, we don't know whose it is. I thought it was yours. I never saw it before in my life. That's a fine thing. Here, I have been driving around all afternoon in a hot car. Mr Shane. If the car was hot it was entirely in your own imagination. I was thinking. Have you got a car? I left it just outside. Well, you'd better be putting it right away unless you plan on using it again. I think it is coming on to rain. - Oh. Yes. That's a good idea. - The garage will be sixpence extra. Let me see. We have not much trade at this time of year so I can give you a corner room. No. We want two rooms. Two rooms? What is the matter? Are you expecting somebody else? No. You see, my husband has a very bad case of hay fever. I want to be sure of a good night's rest. Dear me. Hay fever. However, you will waste no money on any snuff. I've got just the right thing for you if you will follow me. Two rooms adjoining. - I don't want them adjoining. You don't? - No. You see, I... I sometimes walk in my sleep and I... I want to be sure of not walking in on him. Well, you are a queer couple, to be sure. Where are they? They have gone upstairs. Thank you. What do you do for it? What? I said, what do you do for it? Nothing. Nothing? It's up this way. That's the best way to treat it. Ignore it. Your wife told me all about it. She did? Aye. It is a pity and a shame. My grandfather had it bad. He never did anything for it either. It killed him. Your wife's room is down the passage. But you can lock yourself in here. Goodnight. [ Door knocks ] Come in. I am out of cigarettes. I suppose you're wondering that this is all about. A little. Well. Since you are in this thing with me. I've decided to make a clean breast of it. You seem to be looking on it as a sort-of skylark, Mr Shane. But I'm going to tell you the truth. And rely on what little honour you may have left to keep it a secret. I haven't ratted on you yet, have I? No. But you haven't had much of a chance, have you. Okay. Go ahead. Tell your story. Well. On the night of the murder. Captain Stafford, madam. Hello Leslie. Hello. Will that be all for tonight, madam? - Yes, Parker. As soon as you and cook have cleaned up you can go along. To what do I owe the honour of this visit? Now don't be like that, Leslie. After all, it's a long time since we've seen each other. It hasn't seemed long to me. That's too bad. You are drunk. As usual. I may be drunk. But I know what I am doing. You still haven't told me what you came for. It is a matter of the utmost importance. What is the matter? I think I am being followed. Everything looks much the same. I haven't had any money for changes. Mind if I get myself a drink? You will find no change there either. I believe that's the same decanter of Scotch you left. At the same level at which you left it. There are two drinks gone. Probably the butler. I dare say. I hope you don't mind me barging in on you like this. Making myself at home. It seems like old times. Does it? It doesn't to me. Come on, Leslie. I'm not such a bad sort. We've had our quarrels but what man and woman haven't? That's right. But most men when they quarrel don't strike their women. The trouble with you Leslie is you are spoiled. Having no parents, you've always had your own way in everything. A beating once in a while is as good for a high-strung girl as it is for a horse. Edgar. When I married you I looked upon myself as your wife. Not as a possible entry in the Grand National. Well, well. Have it your own way. I intend to. Now, what did you want to see me about? It's about Abbington. He is heading for a lot of trouble. In what way? - I've just come down from there. I didn't like the look of things at all. You know the isolated kind of life he leads. Well, yesterday. He started making wild and irresponsible accusations against my cousin. They have always been jealous of each other. You see, I was engaged to Abbington once. You get around, don't you. I look around if that's what you mean. What girl doesn't? Then what happened? I asked him to leave and he refused. I could see that he was in no mood to be reasonable. So I left shortly and went into my room and locked the door. I threw myself on the bed and I must have dozed off. Because the next thing I knew... Leslie. Edgar. Edgar. Edgar. Who did it? Edgar, tell me. Who was it? S. I. Ten. - Who? Hello? Hello? And that is exactly what happened. I swear it. What is all this malarkey about SI-Ten? Do you expect me to believe that too? - That is what he said. You think I'm pretty dumb, don't you. You think pretty eyes and a kind manner will melt me down to where you want me. Yes. That's what you think. Well, I think you'd just as soon kill a man as look at him. I think you'd have killed me today. I wouldn't get out of the house if you'd had a gun. I simply think your husband came back and started to knock you around again. You picked up the knife off the desk and let him have it. Oh? And I suppose I brought him back too? - I don't know who brought him back. But I do know I don't like the whole business. Unless you decide to come clean with me. I've a good mind to turn you over to the police right now. You wouldn't dare. Wouldn't I? - No. You wouldn't dare. And you know why? No. Because if you did, I would say you were my lover and you killed him a fight. Would you really do that? - Certainly. I only have a few weapons at my command and I intend to use them. You wouldn't stop at anything, would you. No. And neither would you. Open up. - Go away. Leave me alone. I'll leave you alone alright. Oh. I say. Would you mind sending this for me? It is most important. Not at all, Miss. - You will need some money. Thank you, Miss. Hey. Where is that ticket? It is on its way to the north of Scotland. On its way to the north of Scotland? Why? Because that's where we are going. Wait a minute. You didn't say we were going that far. No. Because... I didn't think you'd take me. It doesn't matter. If you drive fast enough you can still catch your boat. Oh. So I am to be a chauffeur. Is that it? Yes. That is just about it. It so happens I can't drive. It is safer than taking the train. You know, I've a good mind to... - Now, listen. You are going to do exactly what I say. If you want that ticket you will behave. As that's the only way you will get it. The story I told you is true and if you don't believe it that is just too bad. But I am not accustomed to being called a liar. And I am not accustomed to being treated like a barmaid. I'm sorry you wandered into this thing. But now you're in it, you will stay in it until I'm ready to let you out of it. And what's more, you are going to believe me before I am through. That is so you won't have to come and borrow some more cigarettes. If you mean gas, I took the liberty of borrowing some from our friend Angus. How much further is this? - It's about 75 miles. You can drive for hours along this road without ever seeing a chicken. That depends on where you are sitting. Hey. Keep your mouth shut. I beg your pardon, but can you direct me to the Highland Bell whiskey distillery? Sorry. We're strangers in these parts. - Wait a minute. You're going in entirely the opposite direction. The distillery is just this side of Abbington. Oh. I must have been directed wrongly. How far is it? About 75 miles. We're going right past it. Would you like a lift? You forget, darling. We promised to stop in at grandmother's. Since when are you an authority on whiskey distilleries? I should know about this one. It belongs to my cousin. A lucky guy. Dan. - Yeah? Didn't you think there was something rather funny about that man? No. Why? I don't know. It seems very strange meeting a man way out here going in the wrong direction. I guess those stories about parachutists have made me a bit jumpy. That's all. Listen, Butch. I've got enough trouble without you dreaming up something else. Say. Your cousin must be in the chips. It doesn't belong to him. It's entailed. You don't say. Well. This is where you get out. Alright. Thanks for the ride. That's alright. I suppose you would like your steamship ticket? Yeah. If it isn't too much trouble. I thought you said... I said it was on its way to the north of Scotland. I carried in my stocking. You see, I wanted to make quite sure that you caught your boat. You know, Butch. You're wasting your time around this joint. Why not come to Chicago with me? No thanks. Look. I am really very grateful for what you have done. Don't thank me. I couldn't help it. I suppose I've been a bit of a stinker but... I felt rather helpless. Well. After all, you don't know what it is to be a woman, do you? No. It must be a great sensation. Dan. Look after yourself. I'll be alright. I'll haul in someplace until it gets dark. And then I'll cut across to Liverpool. Well. Goodbye. Goodbye, Butch. Is Mr Abbington in? Who shall I say? - His cousin. Miss Stafford. Yes, Miss Stafford. He received your wire this morning saying you were coming. Down this way please. Miss Stafford is here, sir. Is she? Well, don't stand there dawdling. Send her in. Very good, sir. "Calling SI-Ten. Calling SI-Ten." "Hello. Hello." [ German language radio ] "Hello?" "SI-Ten." [ German language radio ] "SI-Ten." Yes? I'd like to see Miss Stafford. - Who? Miss Stafford. Miss Leslie Stafford. There is no-one of that name here, sir. - Is there a Mr Abbington here? Mr Abbington is engaged. - Now listen, Jack. I'm a reporter for the London Despatch. You can't offend the press you know. Are you Mr Abbington? Yes. I am Abbington. Who are you? I'm a reporter on the London Despatch. So? I's like to ask you a few questions about the murder at Crescent Gardens. When did you last see your cousin, Miss Leslie Stafford? You've got a terrific amount of cheek barging in here unannounced. As a matter of fact I've haven't seen my cousin in a fortnight. If I were you I wouldn't call the police. Because if you do... I'll tell them that your cousin entered this house not three hours ago. Don't bother. Thank you. You seem to have me, mister... Shane. Shane. Shane? You are an American, aren't you? Brooklyn. Yes, we've met before somewhere. London, wasn't it? Some gambling place. It could be. I like gambling. Do you? So do I. Well, Mr Shane. You seem to have me, as you Americans say, with my guard down. That isn't what we say. Well. Nevertheless, I'll try to take it with good grace. Perhaps you'd like to try some of our Highland Bell? Now you are in this part of the country. I never touch the stuff when I am on an assignment. You are a wise man, Mr Shane. Personally, I've never touched a drop of the... Stuff in my life. As I was saying, you are a wise man, Mr Shane. And I am sure that we can come to some sort of agreement. What... Kind of an agreement? Naturally, I don't want this affair in which my cousin is involved to come out. Until we are a little more sure of our ground. If you are offering me a bribe. The answer is no. That is what I like about Americans. They are always so direct. I would not have called your approach exactly subtle. No? Well, perhaps I've lost my touch. Living in the country like this, one is apt to rusticate. But we'll see eye-to-eye before we are through. How long do those fellows sit there like that? I beg your pardon? The dogs? Until I give the signal. Beautiful specimens, aren't they. They are German dogs, you know. A fine example of careful cross breeding without an alien strain. Oh. German. You know, for all their faults the Germans... Understand the value of biology. And the lessons taught us by evolution. Myself, I think a little bit of mongrel mixed with the best dog on earth... Gives greater stamina and a stronger bite. Well, of course. Being an American, such a philosophy coming from you is... Not entirely surprising. What do you know about the murder in Crescent Gardens? Nothing, Mr Shane. Absolutely nothing. I am as much in the dark as you are. Do you think your cousin killed him? Well, now. She has a very dangerous temper. From what I know of their life together she certainly had every reason to. What do you intend to do about it? Nothing. With your connivance, Mr Shane, I intend to keep quiet. Until we have further evidence to go on. After all. Nobody can actually prove she was in the house. I can prove that she was in the house. Can you? How? Because I was there. Indeed? You're a very enterprising reporter, Mr Shane. You not only seem to have the privilege of choosing your own assignments. But you have the enviable faculty of... Being on the grounds when the crime takes place. I also have an enviable faculty to smell a rat when it's stuck in the drainpipe. Where were you yesterday morning? Look here, old boy. I've been very patient with you but my patience is coming to an end. Now you look here. You haven't answered my question. Where were you? I was right here in this house going about my business. Can you prove it? I can prove it by a dozen people if necessary. [ Door knocks ] The evening post, sir. - Thank you. But I don't think it will be necessary. [ Dogs barking ] You see. You may or may not be reporter, Mr Shane. But I am practically certain you are not a police inspector. And there happens to be one coming up the garden path just now. Scotland Yard rang me today and asked me to keep a lookout for my cousin. So I sent for the local police officer to take her away. I see no reason why he shouldn't take you away at the same time. Inspector. Yes? Come this way. Right. I was waiting for you. Sorry I wasn't in when you called. - That is alright. What's it all about? Anything exciting? Oh. I beg your pardon. I want you to meet Mr Shane. Mr Shane, this is Inspector Robbins. How do you do, Inspector. - How do. How about a drop of sherry? - Thanks very much. Don't mind it I do. Haven't I seen you somewhere before? And quite recently too. Shane. Shane. It seems to me I read something about you in the papers. Yes. We come to that in a moment. Here's your sherry. Thanks, old man. Nothing like a spot of sherry to keep the cold out. I always say. By the way, old man. I noticed you got your car back. My car? Yes. It was standing at the door as I came in. Yes. I noticed it as I came in too. You know, Inspector. I am very interested in automobiles. In fact. I used to be a mechanic. Did you? A nice business. Especially now. No thanks. A bad habit. I was particularly interested in the fittings. There seems to be an unusual combination between the lighter and the dash. Is there really? I didn't notice it. It's a beautiful car, old man. It would have been a shame to lose it. Yes. Well. What were you going to tell me about Mr Shane? He is here on a lecture tour. Something about democracy in the new world. Perhaps you've read about it in the papers. By Jove, that's it. I am glad to hear it. I've always been a friend of progress myself. Well, Inspector. As a friend of progress, I'm sure you'll want to hear something I must tell you. Indeed? And what might that be, Mr Shane? As I was about to say, Inspector. I am sure you'll be interested in learning... That Mr Ford intends to triple the amount of bombers he is turning out. You don't say? Now, isn't that amazing? Well, well, well. But I must be popping along. What was it you wanted to see me about? To let you know the car was back and to thank you for whatever efforts you made. I was rather hoping it was something more exciting than that. Do you mind? We don't get much excitement in these parts, do we. Not much. Well, Inspector. You just keep pitching. Something is liable to pop at any moment. You really think so? Well, I hope you're right. One is liable to get rusty sitting round twiddling one's thumbs as one might say. So long. Now listen to me, Mr Shane. I have no intention of letting you barge in here upsetting all my plans. Evidently you have some connection with my cousin. If you agree to leave now and say nothing about this affair... I'll give you enough money to get out of the country. But if you persist in meddling in affairs that are no concern of yours. I'll have you up on murder charges in collaboration with my cousin. Where do you get off in all this? Where is Miss Stafford now? That's none of your business. - Then I'll make it my business. Boys. Well, Mr Shane? They sure are wonderful dogs. - I am glad you appreciate them. You know. There may be something to your theory of pure breeding after all. I am sure there is. But I will still put my dough on a mutt. Catch him, boys. Butch, where are you? - In here. Where? - Here. In here. Who are you? What do you want? Quick. After him. Quiet. What is the matter? - Don't talk. Just mind me. Come on. Blast. The key is on the other side. Did you see them? - No. They must be going down the trellis. - Come on. Downstairs. Surround the house. You go that way. Come on. Dan. What did baby do now? - I stumbled over that thing. Hurt? - Hmm. Ouch. There is a lighter in my pocket. Right. You alright? Yes. Except for my ankle. It hurts like billy-oh. That's good. You know. That husband of yours may be in a little thick. He certainly had the right steer on Abbington. What did you husband tell you about him? It might be true. I think he... always suspected my cousin's political views. In fact. I think he thought he was working for the Nazi government. That's funny. It seems hardly possible though that... A member of an old scotch family. He isn't scotch. He was adopted by my uncle at the age of twelve. The old man wanted someone to carry on the family name. Where did he come from originally? Germany. But if you think that just because... Listen, sister. I don't think. I know that they catch them young and train them early. Unless we can prove that he is the heavy in this. We are in a tough spot. Ow! You can't walk very far in that. No. I am afraid not. Here. I'm sorry I got you into this. Don't apologise. Now that bird has gotten me mad. I am beginning to enjoy it. You had better bed down here for tonight. How's that? Fine. Thanks. I will sneak out. I'll see if I can borrow us another car. No. Please don't leave me. You will be alright. Oh. You don't trust me yet, do you? You still think I'm going to run out on you, don't you? No. That's not it. It's just that... I'm afraid they might pick you up. And I am frightened. First you're scared of me being here. Now you're scared of me going away. How come? Well. That is... Just the way it is. That's all. This reminds me of the old days when I used to sleep in boxcars. Did you ever... Sleep in a boxcar? A boxcar? No. You ought to try it sometime. It's good for your liver. Dan. I take back what I said about... You not being a gentleman. That is alright. You are not as much of a lady as I thought you were either. Inspector. If you manage to locate them, be sure to let me know. Well? I beg your pardon, sir. But Hans has just arrived by the early morning train. He has, has he? That's very considerate of him. I am sure. Well, sir. What is the meaning of this? My dear Mr Abbington. I am covered with confusion. Everything went wrong. So. You have come to that conclusion, have you? Not only do you allow the girl to escape. But she escapes in my car. What's more, she brings a man with her. An American. And now you tell me that everything has gone wrong. Really, Hans. That is very penetrating of you. I am frightfully sorry, sir. I don't know where the American came from. He seemed to drop out of nowhere. Hans. If this is an example of your training in Germany. I can't say that I like the results. Please, sir. You must not misjudge me. I carried out my orders to the letter. Americans are... Very unpredictable. Yes. So I have heard. - But I knew my duty, sir. When he carried the body out of the house I carried it back again. It was found just as you wanted it. Hans. You are a perfect agent of the New Order. But I am beginning to see what is wrong with it. But it is too late now. I have to get over to the distillery. Inspector Robbins is organising a search party from the village. I want you and James to get in there and see what you can do. They know too much. I understand, sir. Now then, step lively, young fellow. You're not looking for violets you know. That's the trouble with this village you know, Sergeant. They sent all the able-bodied men to war. Which leaves me with nothing but a lot of old jossers and women. Hello, Mrs Bates. Any luck? - Not yet, Inspector. That is too bad. - I say, my girls are rather tired. Too bad, too bad. Inspector. - Yes? Mr Abbington sent us down to help in the search. That's very nice of him. We can use you. They must be about here somewhere. Let's have a go down there. Mrs Bates. Mrs Bates, I have found something. Wait a minute. Where's Miss Stafford? - Where is Miss Stafford? She is coming along with Abbington's men. Abbington's men? You can't trust her to them. Easy now. Don't get excited. You have plenty of time to tell your story. We'd better take him in the schoolhouse, Sergeant. They'll send a bus from town. Come on, you people. I thought you were taking me to the police station. Never mind about that, Miss. You just do as we say. Where is Mr Abbington? - Now, Miss. Just come along. We've got the young lady, sir. What about the man? They got hold of him first, sir. We couldn't do anything about it. Alright. I will see her in a minute. Well, Karl? These papers seem to be in order. From now on you will be known as 'Charles'. Thank you, sir. - What made you so late? I was dropped 75 miles south of Abbington. The pilot must have overshot his mark. Do you know what we do here? Nein, mein Herr. Well, we manufacture a particularly attractive brand of Scotch whiskey. Called Highland Bell. Aged ten years. That is a long time, eh Charles? Yah, mein Herr. Ten years is a long time in this changing world. Put that down. I am sorry to seem so sharp, Charles. But... You see, you don't understand. That is better than our usual stuff. A special concoction of my own. Charles, you must never believe in labels. That is another thing of which one must be careful nowadays. Charles, this particular bottle does not contain Scotch whiskey at all. Nein? - No. This bottle contains a very powerful explosive. Two strong acids. Separated by a thin layer of copper. Over a period of time the one on top... Eats its way through the copper. And mixing with the one beneath. Causes an explosion. [ German language ] Nobody would drink this, Charles. It will be packed aboard ships and sent along with other supplies. To our gallant allies. The ships will be well protected by convoys. But alas. They won't get there, Charles. - Nein? They will blow up. They will blow up... and sink. To the bottom of the sea. Now. Let me get this straight. You say you just popped into the house for a cup of coffee. And found the corpse? - That's right. And you carried it half way across London... And no questions asked? - That's right. Why did you do this, if I may enquire? Just for fun. Fun? A nice sense of humour you must have. I don't think. Now. This is the part that none of us seem to be able to get quite straight. When you returned to the house, what happened? The corpse was back again. Back again? Sitting at the desk? - That's right. With a knife in its back? - That's right. How do you suppose it got there, by parachute? No. I think he was carried back by Abbington or one of his men. Mr Shane, do you realise the importance of the law of libel in this country? I do. Do you wish to retract that statement? - I do not. Oh. Now. What do you think was the purpose in this? To make it look as if Miss Stafford had killed him. As they had planned it in the first place. What possible reason could he have had for doing away with Captain Stafford? Because Stafford... Had discovered that Abbington was working for the Nazi government. Well, Leslie. I think I owe you an apology for this rather rough treatment. But then you would get into it. So. Edgar was right. You are working for Germany. Poor Edgar. He always seemed to get onto things just when it was too late. Well, now that you have me here what are you doing to do? I'm not going to make love to you again, Leslie dear, if that's what you mean. Why don't you be sensible? For instance? Well, you are in rather a bad spot. The police are after you. They have absolutely nothing on me. If you show me a little more cooperation I might be able to get you out of this. How? The American. He broke into your house. Your husband was found murdered. What could be simpler than saying that he did it? That is the sort of solution that might appeal to your type of German. But I'm afraid that we English and Americans will never learn it. If you persist in being quixotic. There is nothing more that I can do. But I advise you to think it over. Meanwhile. I will leave you in charge of Hans. You will find him a very entertaining fellow. If you can manage to draw him out. We've had enough of this. You will be remanded in custody. And you will be tried for murder in London where the crime was committed. Wait a minute. You can't do that. You can't hold me. I'm an American citizen. And I am sailing for home tonight. If I may so, sir. If there is any sailing to be done. It will be in the air. At the end of a rope. Here is Mr Abbington now. Very nice of him to have come down, I must say. Where is Miss Stafford? You said that Abbington's men were going to bring her in. That's right. We did. - Well, where is she? Look. I know my story sounds crazy but you've got to give me a chance to prove it. Abbington has some sort of a shortwave radio set concealed in his dashboard. The last time I tried it I got a German voice apparently giving some sort of... Call signal. Now then, now then. Perhaps we ought to go outside and have a look? Eh? Alright. He might as well be hanged for a sheep as a lamb. Bring him along. Come on. Morning, Robbins. - Good morning, sir. I came down to see if I can help. - Very nice of you, sir. As a matter of fact we expected your men down here before now with Miss Stafford. No. I had her brought directly to the house. She seemed a bit hysterical so we felt we'd give her a chance to calm down. I see. Of course that's a bit irregular. As long as we know she's in good hands. He lies. Can't you see that? She's not at the castle. They've hidden her away. Now then, now then. You have plenty of time to tell your story. I beg your pardon, sir. But this man claims there's something odd about your dashboard. I know he is crazy. But our orders are to humour him and I don't want to leave anything undone. Would you mind letting us see what it's all about? Not at all, Sergeant. Not at all. Go right ahead. But spare the tyres. They're getting scarcer every day. Come on you. None of your tricks. Those German voices you said you heard must have been in your head, sir. Yes? Come here. A sort of an optical delusion. Why do you stay here doing nothing? Are you sure the girl is at the castle? She may be in danger. They might even try to put her out of the way. Come along now. We've had enough of these pipe dreams. Take good care of him, Sergeant. Judging from my conversation with him last night he may actually be dangerous. Chase him! Stop him. Stop him! Stop him. Stop him! Don't stand there like a stuffed fish, Sergeant. After him. I can't, sir. He's taken my motorcycle. - Well, get something. Come on, boy. Give me that bike. Come on. Follow that car. There it is now. Come on, after it. Hey, Butch. Call your shots, will you? Sorry, Dan. There is his motorcycle. Come on. Are you sure? - Yes. I heard all they said from there. Come on. Let's get out of here. Alright, Shane. You seem to be good at getting out of tight places. Let's see you get out of this one. Well. If it isn't little Lord Sunday pants. Alright. What is your proposition? It's a bit late for that. I made you a proposition and you turned it down. Now, you will have to take the consequences. Oh. You mean you are going to shoot me in cold blood? The temperature of your blood Mr Shane, to me is a matter of total indifference. Leslie has probably told you our little secrets by now. So I am afraid that she'll have to go too. She did tell me that one of these bottles... Contains a very powerful explosive. But she didn't tell me which one. Do you think that might be it? I don't know. Put that down! So you don't know either? Well, that makes us even. You said you liked to gamble. Here is your chance. Will you stop fooling and put that back on the table? Or I will... But I am not fooling. If you think I am fooling, brother. Go ahead and shoot. Go ahead and shoot me. This isn't my joint. If I am holding the jackpot we'll all go up in blue smoke. If I am not. You will just have another corpse on your hands. How about it? Your odds are 4-1. May I spit in his eye? I knew you were a welsher. The first time I saw you. You know. It's a funny thing about long odds. They take guts. I want you to drop those guns when I count three. One. Two. Three. You know, some people say gambling is wrong. Maybe it is. But there is one good thing about it. The sucker always loses. Come in, Inspector. You can take them away. There is enough evidence here to hang him twice. Are you Daniel Shane? Yes. And you are Leslie Stafford? - Yes. I say. You've both caused us no end of trouble. What? Mr Barton is from Scotland Yard. - I see. We had Stafford working on this thing for weeks. Stafford? - Yes. He called me the night he was murdered. If you hadn't started carting his body around... We might have solved it days ago. Well. I am sorry. I guess I am just impulsive. I'm sorry. I guess I'm just inquisitive. I would like to know who murdered Captain Stafford. He is the chap Hans lying downstairs. Well I never. I hate to bother you sir, but... I'd like you to come along with us. - What? There are a few questions we must ask you. Just a minute. I have to catch a boat. We will do everything possible, sir. To see that you get it. Alright. Let's get going. Well, Dan? That's what you get for stealing those eggs. I just had to see whether that was the right bottle. Come on. Feb22
