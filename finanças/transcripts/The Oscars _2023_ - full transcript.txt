[dramatic music] Time to go make a movie! [dramatic music] [dramatic music] Lines? Longways and dreams that you never forget. [dramatic music] Camera? [dramatic music] Action! [dramatic music] [screaming] [screaming] [dramatic music] Are you ready? Two-five? Come on, man. [dramatic music] [dramatic music] Only you got it! No, no, just! Yes! [dramatic music] Wherever we go, this family is our fortress. [dramatic music] Show them who we are. [dramatic music] Big heart, amazing! Of all the places I could be, I was always want to hear with you. I want to interrupt ever, ever, and ever, and ever! So let's just call it quits. We won't call it quits. We'll call it the start. [dramatic music] We can't outrun this car, we gotta adjust. One, we need altitude. No, we don't. Pull the ejection handles the second I tell you. I don't want to pull the handles. I don't want to pull the handle. I'm not pulling what's wrong with this guy. You're throwing away! [dramatic music] The jet, the jet, the jet, why are you like this time? [dramatic music] [dramatic music] [dramatic music] [dramatic music] [dramatic music] Ladies and gentlemen, your host for this evening, Jimmy Kimmel. [dramatic music] [cheering] [cheering] [cheering] Thank you. [cheering] Thank you. [cheering] Give me a second, I adjust my danger zone here. My banshees are caught in my inner shearing right now. All right, I'm good. Welcome and congratulations. Welcome to the 95th Oscars. [cheering] You made it. You made it. [cheering] Congratulations. I know that being here tonight is a dream come true for most of the people in this room. Thank you for inviting me to be a part of it, especially this year when the world finally got out of the house to see the films you worked so hard to make, the way you intended them to be seen in a theater. [cheering] And I also want to say that I am happy to see that Nicole Kidman has finally been released from that abandoned AMC, where she has been held captive for almost two full years now. It's good to have you back in a call. And thank you for encouraging people who were already at the movie theater to go to the movie theater. You look great. Everybody looks so great. When I look around this room, I can't help but wonder, is those epic right. for me? We have so many first time nominees here in the acting categories alone. There are 16 first time nominees, including Jamie Lee Curtis, including Hannah DeArmas, Colin Earl Michelle Yow, Brendan Fraser, Keith Riefon. This is I think a great piece of Oscar trivia. Thirty-one years ago in 1992, Brendan Fraser and Keith Riefon were in a movie together. Which movie it was? And Cino Man. Two actors from And Cino Man are nominated for Oscars. [cheering] What a... What an incredible night this must be for the two of you and what a very difficult night for Paulie Shore. [laughter] Maybe it's time to reboot by a dome. Why not all the top ten highest-grossing films this year were sequels or franchises? They say Hollywood is running out of new ideas. I mean, poor Steven Spielberg had to make a movie about Steven Spielberg. [laughter] Congratulations, Steven. Look at this, by the way. I want to say right here, this is my favorite duo of the year, Steven Spielberg and Seth Rogan. What a pair. Joe and Hunter Biden of Hollywood. [laughter] Seth, what are you on right now, be honest? Nothing? Much films, right? [laughter] Did you give one to Steven? Give him one. Let's see what happens. Maybe it'll make something crazy. Steven claims he's never even smoked weed, which I find hard to believe. You need to tell me you were sober when you made a movie about an alien who eats Reese's Pieces all day and... [laughter] Can't remember how to phone home. [laughter] You were high as a bike when you made that movie. [laughter] Steven is the first director to be nominated in six different decades for an Oscar. [cheers and applause] Yes, remarkable. [applause] This time, as you know, he is nominated for the Fable Men's, which is by far his most personal film. They say, "Right, what you know it." And they say, "Right, what you know your mom did with her dad's best friend.". And Steven did that, and the result was yet another Oscar nomination for the great Michelle Williams, who is... [applause] Right there, Michelle. [applause] And the Fable Men's wasn't an easy shoot for Michelle. After almost every take, Spielberg would rush up to her with tears in his eyes, and he'd scream, "That's not how mommy said it." [laughter] I also want to extend congratulations to Steven's longtime collaborator, the Maestro John Williams, who is now the oldest nominee in Oscar history. And he looks great. John turned 91 years old last month, and he's still scoring, if you know what I mean. [laughter] And by the way, if you've never made love to the score from Raiders of the Lost Ark, do yourself a favor. [laughter] Another... only Walt Disney. This is great. An only Walt Disney has been nominated for more Oscars than John Williams. He's been nominated 53 times, and... [applause] ...nominated 53 times. He's won five, which honestly is not that great. [laughter] But good luck tonight. It was a very good year for movies. Business is booming. I know people like to debate now, which is better, movies are TV, but here's the thing. No matter how good a show is, there are some things movies could do that TV just can. For example, a TV show can't lose $100 million. [laughter] Is the gang from Babylon here? They know. [laughter] I was just asking if they were here. I was welcoming. At least Babylon got released in August. You know, back girl became the first superhero to be defeated by an accounting department. [laughter] And then we had the big one, the long, long, long-awaited Avatar, the way of water, which gave... [applause] ...the director, the producer, Jim Cameron, another opportunity to do what he loves to do more than anything else. Browning Kate Winslet. The sequel to Avatar, it's the most expensive movie ever made. Disney spent $2 billion on this movie. Just to break even, all of Nick Cannon's kids had to see Avatar four times. [laughter] And they did, I guess. James Cameron is not here, by the way, tonight. You know a show is too long, and even James Cameron can't sit through it. [laughter] Some of the cynics are saying Jim Cameron isn't here because he didn't get a best director nomination. And while I find it very hard to believe about a man of such deep humility, he does have a point. I mean, how does the Academy not nominate the guy who directed Avatar? What do they think he is, a woman? [laughter] What a... [applause] Thank you, ladies. [applause] It was some year for diversity and inclusion that we have nominees from every corner of Dublin. [laughter] And five Irish actors are nominated tonight, which means the odds of another fight on stage just went way up. [laughter] And while we're on the subject of diversity, I want to say especially those of you watching at home, there are a number of excellent films and performances that were not nominated tonight, including Till and the Woman King, which are both based on two stories with great performances from Danielle's dead-wiler and Viola Davis, that are very worthy of your time if you haven't seen them, as is a small independent film called Top Gun Maverick, the movie that saved the movies. Everyone loved Top Gun. Everybody. [applause] Tom Cruise with his shirt off and that beach football scene, El Ron Hubba Hubba, you know what I'm saying? [laughter] Tom and James Cameron didn't show up tonight. The two guys who insisted we go to the theater didn't come to the theater. So if you're hoping to get a look at Tom Cruise, he's not here, or maybe he is here, maybe that's Tom Cruise right there, wearing a Judd Hirsch Mission Impossible mask. There's only one way to find out for sure. Judd, we're going to need you to drive a motorcycle off the roof of the theater. You know who else is here? The right excellent, Niana, is with us tonight. Riana got her first Austin nomination from the song with Vyak from Black Panther or Thunder Forever. Last month, she performed at the Super Bowl tonight. Riana will be performing at our halftime in just about four and a half hours from now. Riana has a nine-month-old backstage, and he's very cute. He pooped during rehearsal. You know the last person who pooped backstage at the Oscars was? That accountant who mixed up the envelopes. Riana is here, Lady Gaga is here. Wonderful. My God, even Elvis is in the building tonight. Daria's awesome baller. Austin, as you know, is the first time nominee, he was so convincing as Elvis still is. This is a good Hollywood story. After they started shooting Elvis, Tom Hanks gave Austin a vintage typewriter. As a gift and in it, Tom wrote, he left a note written from Colonel Tom Parker to Elvis. So then Austin used the typewriter to write Tom back as Elvis Presley. And they got to know each other by sending letters back and forth as Elvis and Tom. Which is just because you show how incredibly silly this all is. You have silly jobs, but Austin, you're so talented. I know Elvis would have loved your performance. And in fact, according to my QAnon Reddit page, he did. We know this is a special night for you. We want you to have fun. We want you to feel safe. And most importantly, we want me to feel safe. So we have strict policies in place. If anyone in this theater commits an act of violence, at any point during the show, you will be awarded the Oscar for Best Actor. And permitted to give a 19-minute long speech. No, but seriously, the Academy has a crisis team in place. If anything unpredictable or violent happens during the ceremony, just do what you did last year. Nothing. Sit there and do absolutely nothing. Maybe even give the assailant a hug. And if any of you get mad at a joke and decide you want to come up here and get jiggy with it, it's not going to be easy. If you and my friends are going to have to get through first. You're going to have to get through the heavyweight champ, a Donna Screed, before you get to me. You're going to have to do battle with Michelle Yell before you get to me. You're going to have to beat the Mandalorian before you get to me. You are going to have to tangle with Spider-Man. You are going to have to tangle with Fableman. And then you're going to have to go through my right hand man Guillermo if you want to get up to this stage. Oh, wait a minute. Hold on, I should say. The other Guillermo. Not Del Toro. Yes, that one. I know he's cute, but make no mistake. You even so much as waving me that sweet little man will beat the Lydia Tar out of you. There will be no nonsense tonight. We have no time for shenanigans. This is a celebration of everyone here. You told us you wanted all the categories back in and we listened. They're all back in. That's right. We will be showing all 23 categories live tonight, except for one earlier tonight. Best picture went to all quiet on the Western Front. Congratulations to Germany. We put all the categories back in because the movie community wanted it. Almost as much as the television community didn't want it. So no complaining about how long the show is. I saw all your movies. I know it's my turn to make you sit in a theater for three and a half hours. That doesn't mean we don't want to hear you speak. We do. We want your speeches to be moving. We also want to keep it moving. So speech goes on too long. This year we're not going to play you off stage. Instead, we have a group of performers from the movie RRR. We're going to dance you off stage. If you go too long, we're going to polywood gomsrow your ass. So let's get this going. Welcome our first presenters of the night, Wayne Johnson and Emily Blud. [APPLAUSE] Can you do any of those moves? I can. Just like that. I walked out late. Hello. We know the show just started, so we're going to get straight to the point. We're here to present the award for Best Animated Feature. Ah. Yes. Yes. [APPLAUSE] Animation. But where does one even begin to adequately capture the magic that is animated film? I don't know, but that's why we're here. So these are the nominees for Best Animated. And let's talk about it. Let's talk about it. Well, it's a long night. That word, animation. Like many words, it comes from the mother tongue Latin. Oh, my God. It's rude, meaning. To bestow a life. Wayne, we just need to keep this moving. Because you see that exhausted just even at this scene. Emily, is it? Yes. It's-- no, we're just wasting time. I mean, really think about it. It is a really wasting time to say that animation is a very definition of film. Arfully telling Sophia, thank you. Oh, no, what? See that? Yeah. Arfully, thank you guys. Arfully telling sophisticated narratives frame by frame. That it's tied to the origin of cinema itself and encompasses a whole array of visual styles and techniques as displayed by, thank you, the nominees this year. That was very, very nice. Thank you. He's very, very nicely put. And I'm going to give you that one. Here are the nominees for Best Animated Feature Film. Yermold del Toro's Pinocchio. Yermold del Toro, Mark Gustisson, Gary Unger, and Alex Bullfree. You must try your best, and that's the best anybody can do. Mark sell the show with shoes on. He looks like she'll come. He's at home. Andrew Goldman, Caroline Kaplan, in Paul, Miss A. Sometimes people say that my head is too big for my body, and then I say, "comparadot what?". Plus in Boots, the last wish. Joe Crawford and Mark Swift. There may be if you dare. The sea beast, Chris Williams, and Jet Slanger. You didn't stop me, don't you? That's not the same thing. Isn't it? Turning red, Domi Shoe, and Lindsey Collins. I like Joe, I'm reading! I'm 13, feel with it! Okay. And the Oscar goes to Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio. [applause] You get in the photo of First Saw Walt Disney's Pinocchio as a child, and Belcocchio is the first time somebody captured how scary childhood could be. [applause] Wow. Thank you. It's so good to know that this art form that we love so much, stop motion is very much alive and well. I want to thank Shadow Machine and the crew up in Portland. I want to thank the Henson Company and Lisa Henson. I want to thank my beautiful wife and Sebastian as well. And this man who was really the Genesis of everything, including my drinking problem. [laughter] Animation is cinema. Animation is not a genre. And animation is ready to be taken to the next step. We are all ready for it. Please help us. Keep animation in the conversation. I would like to thank Netflix and Datsarandos for sustaining his faith and us to make this movie. And I want to thank this to my love of my life, my wife Kim, my kids, and my mom and Bob, they're not here anymore. But they are here with me and I'm your son and I love you. Thank you. [applause] [music] Coming up, all Ariana de Beaux, Troy Potser, and a performance by Sophia Carson and later the award for cinematography.

Here's the first. With four nominations, this is Avatar, The Way of Water. The way of water has no beginning and no end. Life. To death. Duck next. Go! To light. [music] What to connect all things. [applause] Welcome back. That was Avatar The Way of Water, the third highest grossing movie of all time change. The camera has now directed $3 billion movies or given his marital history $3 billion movie. We have a lot of history of the making tonight including a man who could become our oldest acting winner ever, one of my favorites, Judd Hirsch, Judd Terns, 88 years old on Wednesday, 88 years old this week. So we're going to do his category first. Let's do it. Here to present The Oscar for Actor and Actress in a Supporting Role, last year's Actor and Actress in Supporting Role, Oscar winners Troy Cotsler and Ariana DeBose. [applause] [music] We are thrilled to be back to present The Oscars for Best Supporting Actor and Supporting Actress. Besides sharing groundbreaking wins last year, we also share a love of. collaborating with others to connect with an audience. We are both so pleased and encouraged that the movies and the people who make them are becoming more inclusive and more of a reflection of the audiences that are inspired by them. [applause] In many earliest opportunities, my roles were voiced by other actors off stage. Tonight, it doesn't matter where the sound comes from. This is me signing. And I am delighted to honor these artists. Though the characters they played are not considered leads, their contributions to a film and the importance of their roles are pivotal. Here are the nominees for Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role. Brendan Gleason, The Vanshees of an Assurance. They have something to close last. Music lasts, paintings lasts, and poetry lasts. Fifty years time, no one would remember any of us. [applause] Brian Tyree Henry, Carzware. Those are the cards, you know. But yes, I'll never forget how the cards were. I remember looking at us, it was like she said, but... like... See you later. [applause] You had to hurt a federal news. So you like the movies, huh? You love those people, huh? Your sisters, your mother, your papa. Exam, this side thing you love, olden. Believe me, Sammy Boy, I get it. Family, art. Huh? I'll tear you into. [applause] Barry Tyree, olden. The Vanshees of an Assurance. You know, what it was what you asked you was. You probably wouldn't ever want to. I don't know. I fell in love with a boy like me, would you? Yeah. No. I didn't think so. Well, there goes that dream. [applause] Can you hear me, boy? Everything everywhere else. The good couple, there's a great evil that has taken away in my world, and it's the good experience, can you ask me what the many versus... All those years of searching have brought me here. Do you? [applause] And the Oscar goes to... Can you hear me? [applause] Key Freekon made his big screen debut in Indiana Jones in the Temple of June, and think data in the Goonies. He holds a film degree from the USC School of Cinematic Arts, and has worked as a skunk coordinator and assistant director. [applause] [applause] Oh, my gosh! [applause] [applause] Thank you. Thank you. [applause]. My mom is 84 years old, and she's at home watching. My... I just want an Oscar! [applause] My journey started on a boat. I spent a year in a refugee camp, and somehow I ended up here on Hollywood's biggest stage. [applause]. They say stories like this only happen in the movies. I cannot believe it's happening to me. This... This is the American Dream! [applause] Thank you so much. Thank you so much for the academy, for this honor of a lifetime. Thank you to my mom for the sacrifices she made to get me here. To my little brother, David, who caused me every day, just to remind me to take good care of myself. I love you, brother. [applause].

Dreams are something you have to believe in. I almost gave up on mine. To all of you after, please keep your dreams alive. [applause] Thank you. Thank you so much for welcoming me back. I love you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. [applause] [applause]. Oh, my lord, I'm a big ol' softie. I'm a pure cry, I like that. I feel you. Okay. [chuckles] And now to the equally exceptional women. who captivated us with emotionally searing performances. Here are the nominees for Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role. Angela Bassett, Black Panther of Canada. I am Queen, but we have a powerful mixture in the world. And my entire family is gone. Have I not given a freak thing? [applause] Haru Cha, away. You listen to me. He doesn't need saving. In a few days, he's probably going to be dead. So what he needs is for you to leave him alone. I'm the only one who can help him. You understand me? [applause] Carrie, time to introduce the band-cheers of Inisha. Hey, what the hell's going on with you, me brother? You can't just all of a sudden stop being friends with a fella. Why can't I? Why can't you? Because it isn't nice. [applause] Jamie Lee Curtis, everything ever on Earth. Well, you may only see a pile of born forms and numbers. But I see a story, so I can trace the ups and downs of your lives. And it doesn't look good. It does not look good. [applause] It's got the issue of everything ever on Earth. I'm tired. I don't want to hurt anymore, and for some reason when I'm with you, it just hurts the both of us. Just let me go. [applause] And the Oscar goes to... [applause] Jamie Lee Curtis!

[applause] And my mother and my father were both nominated for Oscars in different categories. I just won an Oscar. [applause] Please welcome Hara Delevie. [music] To try and summarize the experiences of all those who identify as women in one movie would be impossible. But the seven short films helped by seven female directors that make up tell it like a woman, demonstrate how important it is for individuals to control their own narratives. When we get to tell our own stories, we can thrive. Here performing applause from tell it like a woman, please welcome honorary Oscar winner Diane Warren and Sophia Carson. [applause] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] To each and every single woman in this room, and to all the women of the world, give yourselves to the applause.

What is it? We have a problem. I don't honestly believe what they're saying. I'm worried. She's starting to disappear into herself. Beautiful. [applause] That is TAR. Kate Blanchett is nominated for the eighth time tonight. She's incredible as she always is, and the movie is absolutely masterful. Let me see only one movie this year that starts with the main character being interviewed for 15 minutes by New Yorker, staff writer Adam Gopnik. Make it TAR. You'll be glad you did. Our next category is documentary feature, which as you may recall is where we had that little skirmish last year. Hopefully this time it goes off without a hitch, or at least without hitch. Please put your hands together and then keep them to yourself for Oscar winners, Riz Ahmed, and Amir Questlove Thompson. [applause] You know how to say truth is stranger than fiction. Well, this here is nominees for Best documentary, told stories that you really could not make up. With emotional ruinous, the most fiction can only really aspire to and be inspired by it. And you know what I mean? I've got to say, I love your documentary last year. This here is nominees. Yeah. Thank you. I love you. Thank you. I'm also special about it was like a lot of these nominees, it's told an amazing untold story. Thank you, man. We're making a documentary using never-before-seen footage. It gives new life a new meaning. And it's just one of the techniques used by these documentarians. And the other is used as archival photographs or an innovative ways or spent years following their subjects, both animal and human. Right. But no matter what the approach these filmmakers captured, these universal truths through such unique stories, whether it was about orphanages or political dissidents, injured birds, groundbreaking artists, and even volcano chasing lovers. And what brought these stories to the life on screen are these filmmakers unique lenses and points of view. So here are the nominees for Best documentary feature film. All the breeds, Sean Xen, are my man in Teddy Lufa. All the beauty in the bloodshed, Laura Fojras, Howard Goodler, John Lyons, Nan Goldie, and Yoni Goldie Hov. Many people have started to refuse donations from the Sacklers. A pair of love, Sarah Dosa, Shane Boris, and Eina Fichman. A house made of splinters, Simon Lorraine Wuhmont, and Monica Hostrom. The story of the film is a very difficult story. The story of the film is a great story. It's a very difficult story. It's a very difficult story. It's a very difficult story. It's a very difficult story. It's a very difficult story. It's a very difficult story. It's a very difficult story. It's a very difficult story. And the Oscar goes too. Now, Vowni. Daniel Royal, Desser Ray, Diane Becker, Melanie Miller, and Shane Boris. Director Daniel War and his team filmed a vaccine of all enable he was in hiding from the Russian government at a remote location in Germany. [APPLAUSE] Thank you to the Academy. We are humbled to be in the company of such an extraordinary crop of documentary filmmakers. These films redefine what it is to be a make a documentary. To everyone who helped make our film, you know who you are, your bravery and courage, made this film possible. We owe so much to our Bulgarian nerd with a laptop, Crystal Grozev. [APPLAUSE] Crystal, you risk everything to tell this story and its investigative journalist like you and Maria Pebchick that empower our work to the Navalny family. Yulia, Dasha, and Zahar. Thank you for your courage. The world is with you. And there's one person who couldn't be with us here tonight. Alexei Navalny, the leader of the Russian opposition, remains in solitary confinement for what he calls. I want to make sure we get his words exactly right. Vladimir Putin's unjust war of aggression in Ukraine. I would like to dedicate this award to Navalny to all political prisoners around the world. Alexei, the world has not forgotten your vital message to us all. We cannot, we must not be afraid to oppose dictators and authoritarianism wherever it rears its head. I want to invite Yulia to say a few quick remarks. Yulia. [APPLAUSE] Thank you. So, how's it going? Daniel, and thank you to everybody here. My husband is in prison just for turning the truth. My husband is in prison just for defending democracy. Alexei, I am dreaming the day when you will be free and our country will be free. Stay strong, my love. Thank you. [APPLAUSE] What's the motion we hear? Yeah, it is. Well, most of the film and video we watch these days is short form. And these next nominees are pushing the possibilities of that medium to its fullest. If feature films are like novels, short films are like poetry, got to distill all that emotion, suspense and impact right down to a fraction of the length. Here are the nominees for Best Live Action in short film. And Iris Goodbye, Tom Barkley, and Ross White. And he goes to an Irish goodbye, Tom Barkley and Ross White. Tom Barkley, voice Prince Harry's thoughts in a TV documentary. Ross White hails from Belfast, the filming location of an Irish goodbye. [APPLAUSE] There we may. Thank you so much to the academy for this incredible, incredible honor. Thank you to our fellow nominees, all the nominees for your work. It inspires us so very, very much. Thank you to everybody back home in Northern Ireland who helped us make this film. We wish we had the time to list you all here, but you know who you are. There's something very important we'd like to speak about as well. This award is actually the second most important thing about today because it's this man's birthday. [APPLAUSE] He's out here in Hollywood, wearing a leopard print suit jacket. We love to use the rest of our time up here to sing for James. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday, James. Happy birthday to you. [APPLAUSE] [MUSIC PLAYING] [APPLAUSE] Welcome back to the Dolby Theatre, nominated for nine Oscars. This is all quiet on the Western Front. [APPLAUSE] [MUSIC PLAYING] [APPLAUSE] [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [APPLAUSE] [MUSIC PLAYING] [APPLAUSE] And now, Michael B. Jordan and Jonathan Majors. [MUSIC PLAYING] Hey, Aunty. We love you. [MUSIC PLAYING] A question. A question from my director. Ready? Let's do it. How do you make a character of massive, imposing, and dominating? Oh. Well, first of all, we cast you. [LAUGHTER] That's a great answer, Michael. Thank you. Thank you. Second, give the cinematographer the space to put the camera low, pointing up, and spiky, and his legendary cinematographer, Ernest Dickerson, did with Malcolm X, as you can see here, with their signature, double-Dolly shot. Cinematographers find new ways to push the limits of film and storytelling each year. Back in the day, director Orson Wells and his cinematographer, Greg Tolin, had to be innovative, because they were using a camera like this. Oh, that's a beast. [LAUGHTER] Yeah? I mean, that was before cell phones. So they actually cut a hole in the floor and physically lowered the camera. OK. That's what I call a workout and a flex. It's pretty big flex. But the result was this shot. Sometimes the simplest solutions are the most creative. In fact, creative vision is a trait shared by the next outstanding artist, here at a nominee who's for achievement and cinematographer. [APPLAUSE] Hello, quiet on the western front. James Frand. [MUSIC PLAYING] Gardo, false chronicle of a handful of truths. Darius, Kanji. Elvis, Mandy Walker. [MUSIC PLAYING] Empire of light, Roger Deacons. Tor, Glorian Hofmeister. [MUSIC PLAYING]. [APPLAUSE] OK. And the Oscar goes too. All quiet on the western front. James Frand. James Frand. [APPLAUSE] James Frand studied electro-technical engineering and got his first chance to work on sets as an electrician. An advocate of mentorship in the industry. He has inspired to become a filmmaker at 13 when he first saw Alien. [APPLAUSE] It's not my birthday. [LAUGHTER] But I feel like it is. I mean, what an honor. Academy, thank you so much. Thank you for everything. And my fellow nominees, your work is just outstanding and inspires me. And just thank you for everything my entire crew who made this happen for me and made me look better than I am. And my darling, my dad, when I was-- said I want to run off to the circus, John D'Sercus of the film industry. They believed in me and thank you. And my beautiful wife and cargy. My brother and my sister who just pushed me and pushed me and pushed me and and Edward Berger and my-- [APPLAUSE] Just thank you so much. I'm sorry if I've missed anyone out, but thank you. From the bottom of my heart, thank you so much. Thank you so much. [APPLAUSE] [MUSIC PLAYING] Please welcome, Donnie Yen. [MUSIC PLAYING] [APPLAUSE] As an action filmmaker who has choreographed and performed in countless feistings in 80 movies, I know you should always be prepared for whatever twist and turns. Come your way. One minute, you're fine. The next, your fingers are heart dogs. [LAUGHTER] Every day we confront it with new choices and it's hard to know which path you should follow. This next song reminds us that you don't need to know how to verse jump or experience the entire multiverse at once. You just need to enjoy the ride. It'll perform this is a life from everything everywhere all at once. Please welcome Sun Lock, Stephanie Xu, and Academy Award winner, David Byrne. [APPLAUSE] [MUSIC PLAYING] This is a life every possibleity from best and I choose you and you choose me. Not only would we serve with space, but every time you choose.

[MUSIC PLAYING] We're back with two nominations. Our next nominee for Best Picture is Women Talking. [MUSIC PLAYING] We were given two days to forgive the attackers before they returned. If we did not forgive them, we would be ordered to leave the colony. We must decide now to stay in fight or leave. This is how we want to teach our daughters to defend themselves. When we've liberated ourselves, we don't have to ask ourselves who we are. [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] Here are Oscar winner Jennifer Connolly and honorary Oscar winner Samuel L. Jackson. [MUSIC PLAYING] [APPLAUSE] As we've seen tonight, every artistic contribution is vital to the process of making a movie. As actors, we work very closely with hair and makeup teams. They are friends. They are therapists. In fact, Jennifer and I have had the pleasure of being personally transformed by several of the nominees. But we wish them all good luck, even the ones we haven't worked with, because we may end up in your chairs too. [LAUGHTER] The astonishing work that these artists have accomplished this year display their profound skill and technical expertise. These films wouldn't be the same without them. And we can thank these gifted collaborators for always helping us look the part. Here are the nominees for achievement in makeup and hair styling. All quiet on the Western Front.

[LAUGHTER] I would like to thank the amazing makeup artists that worked with us to create the character of Charlie. So Kathy C. Chris Galler, her Michelle Bougie in the shop, the entire makeup team, our director, Darren Arunowski, pushed us to new heights. Thank you. Our amazing actor, Brendan Fraser, over there.

[MUSIC PLAYING] [APPLAUSE] [MUSIC PLAYING] [APPLAUSE] Welcome back to the Oscars with nine nominations, including Best Picture. This is the Banchis of Inna Sharon. My daughter's volunteer. I just don't like Inna more. I think I need to spend the time I've left composing. No one will remember any of us. Everyone knows more times, name. I don't. So there goes that theory. I don't know what you mean, brother. He's Donald Shavan. But he's always been done. You used to be nice. And now, to know what you are. Not nice. That one we have seen now, would have. Some things there's no more of an animal. And I think that's a good thing. [APPLAUSE] It's a Jenny. She is one of the stars of Banchis of Inna Sharon. [APPLAUSE] Oh, I'm Jenny. Not only is Jenny an actor, she's a certified emotional support donkey. At least that's what we told the airline to get her on the plane from Ireland. So if you're feeling upset or that you win or you're anxious or maybe you just love mules, feel free to come up and give her a hug. And Jenny, I want to see. There's your friend Colin right there.

[APPLAUSE] [MUSIC PLAYING] I would just like to begin by saying thank you to the Academy because for those that do not know, every year the Oscar for costume design is presented by the most stylish and fashion forward actors in Hollywood. And Paul Dano. [LAUGHTER] Being nominated for an Oscar is the second greatest honor a costume designer can receive. The greatest honor is when an actor accidentally takes their beautifully designed costume home with them. Seeing these exquisite designs up close, you know exactly why their designers are nominated tonight and exactly why they might end up hitting an actor's car trunk or gym bag. And by the way, Julia, that is a gorgeous dress you're wearing. Oh, thank you so much. It's from National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation 1989. Here are the nominees for Achievement in Costume Design.

In addition to being sung in Telugu and illustrating the film's anti-colonialist themes, it's also a total banger. [LAUGHTER] It's on millions of views on YouTube and TikTok, has audiences dancing in movie theaters all around the world, and is also the first song ever from an Indian production to be nominated for an Oscar. [APPLAUSE] Do you know not to? Because if you don't, you're about to. [APPLAUSE] From the film, "R-R" this is "NATO NATO." [APPLAUSE] [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [APPLAUSE] [APPLAUSE] [MUSIC PLAYING] [APPLAUSE] [MUSIC PLAYING] [APPLAUSE] [MUSIC PLAYING] [APPLAUSE] [APPLAUSE] [MUSIC PLAYING] Coming up, San Mahayak Pino and Antonio Bandes, and later Hugh Grant and Andy McDowell present the Oscar for production design to learn more about our nominated production designers, scan the QR code on your screen.

We've added that hour into the telecast. [LAUGHTER] Please welcome Eva Longoria and the president of the Academy Janet Yang. [APPLAUSE] [MUSIC PLAYING] Hello, everyone.

My costume designer, Lizzie Krissel, my production designer, Christian Goldbeck, my hair and makeup designer, High-Comerica. And I owe everything to you. I owe everything to you in the rest of my crew. But the other day, I walked into a brunch here. And I met another cinematographer, James Donton. It's about another movie. And it was Florian Hoffmeister, who was also nominated for an Academy Award for TAR. And we held each other. We're from the same town. We held each other. And for 30 years, we made our first movie together. I was his assistant. And we held each other. And for 30 years, it felt like there was an embrace of all the hard work that went into this.

[MUSIC PLAYING] [APPLAUSE] Welcome back to the Oscars at the Dolby Theatre, with seven nominations tonight, including Best Picture. This is the Fablemans. [APPLAUSE] And this family is the scientists versus the artists. Shouldn't you be filming this? $100 for a hobby. Can you stop calling it a hobby? You always dismiss what he does. It's playful or imaginative. You stop making movies. It'll break your mother's heart. You do what your heart says you have to, so you don't owe anyone your life. [APPLAUSE] Well, we are at the Oscars. We have many more awards to go. How are you guys holding up? Everybody OK? [APPLAUSE] Yeah, hang in in there. I put food under your seats. I don't know if you noticed it, but-- [APPLAUSE] This point in the show kind of makes you miss the slapping a little, right? [LAUGHTER] Three of the eight categories that are making this show longer tonight are for shorts, ironically. Here with the Oscars for documentary and animated shorts, Elizabeth Olsen, and a guy most of America is watching on either HBO or Disney+ right now, Pedro Pascal. [APPLAUSE] [MUSIC PLAYING] Rather than shy away from a challenge, the filmmakers in these next categories have embraced it. Presenting stories in a limited time frame. But these limits had no effect on the types of stories they could tell or the depths they could explore. Here are the nominees for Best Documentary Short Film. The elephant whispers, "Cartic even saw this and unique manga." "Paul out, Evgenia Arpugayova and Maxim Arpugayov." How do you measure a year? J. Rosenblatt. "M I'm a master her. Measure a year." The Martha Mitchell effect, and over again, and Beth Levison. Stranger at the gate, Joshua Saphtel and Connell Jones. And the Oscar goes to the elephant whispers, "Cartic even saw this and we need manga." [APPLAUSE] The great manga was amongst the first producers from India to be inducted into the academy. "Cartic even saw this as warp travels extensively to capture visuals that will raise awareness about cultures, animals, and the environment." [MUSIC PLAYING]. I stand here today to speak for the sacred bond between us and our natural world, for the respect of indigenous communities, an empathy towards other living beings we share our space with, and finally, for coexistence. Thank you to the academy for recognizing our film, highlighting indigenous people, and animals, to Netflix for believing in the power of this film, to Bowman, Belly, and for sharing their sacred tribal wisdom. To gunit my producer, and secure to Douglas Blush, my mentor, and my entire team, and finally, to my mother, father, and sister, who are up there somewhere, and you are the center of my universe, to my motherland India. [APPLAUSE] [MUSIC PLAYING] [APPLAUSE] These next nominees used animation to make the most of their limited screen time, employing a variety of visual styles and techniques to carry out a story in 40 minutes or less. In just 24 minutes, one nominee even managed to fit in an entire year's worth of--. [LAUGHTER] What? What, what, what, what, what, what? Boy, you'll find out when you watch this. Oh, how thrilling. Here are the nominees for Best Animated Short Film. The boy, the mole, the fox, and the horse, Charlie Maccassy and Matthew Freud, the flying sailor, Amanda Forbus and Wendy Tilby. Ice merchants, Joao Rosalesh and Bruno Capella. My year of dicks, Sara Guna-Stalker, and Pamela Rivet. And ostrich told me the world is fake, and I think I believe it. Walklyn Pendragon. And the Oscar goes to the boy, the mole, the fox, and the horse, Charlie, Maccassy, and Matthew Freud. The animation team behind the boy, the mole, the fox, and the horse, worked remotely throughout COVID to create a look that closely resembled the ink and watercolor illustrations from the book on which it was based. [MUSIC PLAYING] We've never made a film before, so this is bewildering beyond. And I know the protocol is to say thank you a lot, but I'm British. So I'm more comfortable saying sorry. [LAUGHTER] So I'm really sorry to all the people who should be on this stage with us. We had an extraordinary team with Cara-Sbella and Peter Bainton, JJ, and Hannah, and his own John, and our amazing cast and over 100 animators. I'm also really sorry to my children and my girlfriend and my colleagues at Freud's for basically being absent for the last two years as this film took flight. But this statue is for the dog, Vincent, and the boy, Charlie. [APPLAUSE] And hello. I'm sorry. I'll be brief. It's a recurring theme, the apology. I was in my village very recently, and a lady came up to me. and said, I hear you're going to ask a thing. And I said, yeah. And I said, I think I'll need help. I'm going to my clothes. And she said, you will. And it's a recurring theme with clothing in myself. And she then said, as a long pause, and she said, you know Charlie, I think it takes a lot of courage to make fun. And I think when you go there, there'll be a lot of very, brave people in the same room. And I looked, I said, yeah, I think you're right. And it's really true. And the people that I've worked with, they've tolerated me for two years. And they're brave and kind. And thank you so much. And thank you to my mom and my family, and my dog who I've left behind who's in a hotel. I hate to say that kind of a search. [LAUGHTER] I wasn't really meant to say that. Anyway, thank you so, so much for this. And thank you. [APPLAUSE] I wrote this song with my friend, Bloodpop, for the film Top Gun Maverick and my studio basement. It's deeply personal for me. And I think that we all need each other. We need a lot of love to walk through this life. And we all need a hero sometimes. There's heroes all around us in unassuming places. But you might find that you can be your own hero, even if you feel broken inside.

Thanks to the Academy for this huge recognition. When I was working on the film, I was thinking a couple of times off my mind. Because she was telling me every now and then, when you wanna change humanity and empathy in the world, you have to start by yourself and with your own surroundings. Because you learn by that and you can show actually where we all can live together. So, by working on a film like that, you always are deeply touched and sometimes you have to make this screen very small because there are so much explosions happening. (audience laughs). I wanna say thank you to my wife Elizabeth and my kids up there, Lottepolina and Lucas, to Malte Gruenert and Edward Beggar and the whole cast and crew for their amazing craftsmanship. To Netflix for their huge support and to my fellow nominees, Carter, John, Justin, Sun Lux, that I can be a part of such a unique human and diverse group of talented composers that's for me a big gift. And last but not least, I wanna thank all of you for this wonderful evening. Thank you so much. (audience cheers) Hi, I'm Bill Kramer, CEO of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Throughout the year, the Academy recognizes and celebrates all aspects of the film industry and the diverse, talented people who make movies. In September, the Academy announced the 14 winners of the 49th Student Academy Awards. In October, at the Academy Museum Gala, Mickey Lee, Steve McQueen, Joya Roberts and Tilda Swinton were honored for their powerful work and commitment to cinema. At November's Governors Awards, the Academy presented honorary Oscars to use on policy, Diane Warren and Peter Weir and the Gene Herschelt Humanitarian Award to Michael J. Fox. And, in February, at the Academy's side tech awards, 14 recipients received technical achievement awards. Scientific and engineering awards were presented to four recipients. Ryan Laney received an award of commendation and the Gordon E. Sawyer Award was presented to Ian Neal. For more information on these awards [applause] [music] [music] [music] Coming up, Elizabeth Banks would be offered for visual effects, plus a performance by Rihanna, later Idris Elba, Nicole Kidman and John Travo Valle, plus the awards for her original and a Daffin's Green Place. To hear from the nominated writer, scan the QR code. [music] [applause] [music] The Oscars are back with eight nominations, including Best Picture. This is Elvis. [music] The way he's saying, "It's God-getting." Sort of can't be nothing wrong with it. [music] He's thinking, "It's your dream, it can do it." He's gotta be making a more such thing like him. This color will be over the flash. [music] There's a lot of people saying a lot of things. But in the end, you gotta listen to yourself. [music] [music] [music] And now, please welcome Elizabeth Banks. [music] [music] Hit the Mark. Thank you. Oh my God. He tripped me. I recently directed the film "Co-Cane Bear." [applause] And without visual effects, this is what the bear would look like. [laughter] It's terrifying. Stop it. No director wants to deal with this. Okay. What are you doing? Stop it. Stop. Put your paw down. Why are you trying to score right now? You need to wait till the after party like everybody else. The Coke is not real. It's visual effects. Right? It's all of it. Why are you dragging, squirting leave her into this? Do not drag legend. She doesn't know. What? The Navi are not real. It's visual effects. I have a Tars visual effects. Is this all quiet on the western front? Okay. That's visual effects. It was a real war, but real visual effects. Batman flying around. It's not real. Tom Cruise flying around is real. [laughter] But also visual effects. Wakanda. Wakanda is totally real. [applause] It's all about visual effects. Can enhance any visual effects. Can enhance any story in our incredible tool for filmmakers like me. And without visual effects, Coke and Bear would have been some actor in a parachute probably on Coke. [laughter] Huh, here are the nominees for Achievement in Visual Effects. Get out. All quiet on the western front. Frank Petzel. Victor Miller. Makus Front. And Camille Jafar. Avatar.

[CHEERING] Go to me, Lamaha Gutt. To James Cameron, our Jim Cameron, whose an artistic component is on every frame of this movie. Honestly, and John Landell, who is the engine who drove us forward. We accept these awards on behalf of a very, very large crew. We'd like to thank the lab in LA, the lab on the stage crew. It both LA and New Zealand. What are the effects? The two tales and strong, it's in ways. We're the team, the production team, Joe, the artists, and army of artists. And the amazingly talented supervisors that we have are the effects. Style on the shoulders of our actors. Our performances are everything. And we need to thank our families. [MUSIC PLAYING] Oh, that is unfortunate. I happen to know before he was cut off the Avatar visual team, asked me to announce that if anyone's interested, the visual effects after party is at CGI Fridays. [LAUGHTER]. They tricked me again. All right, now we're going to do something I don't think has ever been done at the Oscars. While we reset the stage for a very special performance, we invited viewers watching from all over to send questions for the stars. And now I'm going to ask some of the stars, some of the questions that the viewers sent in, starting with Malala, who is here. Malala, welcome. Thank you so much. Great to have you here. And congratulations on your movie. This question is from Joanne Nicholas and Brooklyn, New York. She asks, "Your work on human rights and education for women and children is an inspiration." As the youngest Nobel prize winner in history, I was wondering, "Do you think Harry Styles spent on Chris Pine?" I only talk about peace. That's, you know what? That's why you're Malala and nobody else is. [APPLAUSE] That's a great answer, Malala. The winner is Malala Land, everybody. And the next question is from Joey Parello from Las Vegas for Colin Ferrell. Haven't seen Joey in years. Well, Joey would like to ask you. He said, " Colin, I loved your performance in the band cheese of industry. And my question is, what were you saying in the movie?". [LAUGHTER] I'd like him to go on YouTube and check out SNL last night and he'll have a good idea. And now we'll figure it out. All right. Thank you very much. And I apologize for Joey. If you and the donkey go out after text me, okay? Look at this, creepy, throckie. Again, congratulations. Next question is for, oh, Jessica Chastain. Where is she at? Jessica, hi, Jessica. There's no name on this one. It says, "Jessica, was it difficult filming your movie, the Martian? Because your co-star Matt Damon can't read and smells like dog medicine.". [LAUGHTER]. I didn't really have a lot of scenes with them, so it was fun. Excellent. Wonderful. All right. Another fun fact. Oh, they feed Matt Damon peanut butter on set to make it look like he's talking. That's... Cocaine Bear leave, Malala alone. Come on. All right. We got to get this guy out of here. Please say hello from Black Panther, Deny Gherira. [APPLAUSE] [MUSIC] Lupid Gorenson, Ryan Coogler, Thames, and Rihanna. Rode Ballad that speaks from the heart as a tribute to the late Chadwick Boseman. [APPLAUSE] Chadwick's powerful artistry, his magnetism, and incomparable humanity left an indelible Mark on our hearts.

Later, Hallie Berry and Harris and Ford. To hear from the sound nominees, scan the QR code. [MUSIC] We're back with our next Best Picture nominee nominated for 11 Oscars with two wins so far tonight. This is everything everywhere Hallad once. I do have a lot of free rejection. Every disappointment has led you to this moment. [MUSIC] [LAUGH] [MUSIC]. [APPLAUSE] We are back at the Oscars. As you can see, I've changed from a black tuxedo jacket into a white jacket that we've reached the point in the broadcast where I spilled bakamole on the black jacket. [LAUGH] Everything everywhere Hallad once is the most nominated film of the year. [APPLAUSE] And I want to mention, let's go. It's great stars, the one and only 94 year old James Hong who's sitting right here. [APPLAUSE] James is a legend. James has been in more than 650 movies and TV shows. He didn't even start acting professionally until he was 25 years old. Before that, he was a civil engineer who helped design the road system here in Los Angeles. And James, let me say you were one of our great living actors and one of our worst civil engineers. [LAUGH] The roads are unconscionable. Where we salute you, James. Our next two categories honor the lonely nerds who spend day after day in front of a computer screen. They're called writers. And some of them are about to get an Oscar, which is going to crush on their Tinder profiles. Please welcome Oscar nominees, Florence, Pew and Andrew Garfield. [APPLAUSE] [MUSIC] So the best screenplays to read are just as alive as the films that they eventually become. But before the words can flow, writers need that creative spark. Ruben Erselin said he wanted to create a roller coaster. Yeah. I agree. I fully agree. He wanted to create a roller coaster ride for adults with his take on the uber wealthy. Tony Kushner, collaborated with Steven Spielberg remotely during the pandemic after years of convincing him to tell his personal story. But Daniel Kwan and Daniel Shynert, their screenplay came into focus with the phrase, "Let's put my mom in the matrix." [LAUGH] Let's see. Martin McDonough wanted to explore the experience, but break up. So imagine two buddies at the end of their friendship. And Todd Field wanted to examine the nuances of modern power dynamics, framing it unexpectedly in the world of classical music. Here are the nominees for Best Original Screenplay. [APPLAUSE] The band's shoes of inner sharing written by Martin McDonough. A text turned to tango. I don't want to tango. Everything everywhere all at once, written by Daniel Kwan and Daniel Shynert, Wake up for it one day. I'm going to put everything on a bagel.

You can bother someone else to try and teach you to crawl to the podium. Triangle of sadness, written by Ruben Uselin. Where am I? Captain. May he's good. [APPLAUSE] And the Oscar goes too. Everything everywhere. [APPLAUSE] And the Wands, Daniel Shynert. [APPLAUSE] Daniel Kwan and Daniel Shynert began conceiving their screenplay in 2010, eventually organizing and narrowing down their fragmented ideas by 100. [APPLAUSE] Oh, my God. [APPLAUSE] All right. [APPLAUSE] OK, I had a fantasy as a kid of winning an award and going up and telling off all the teachers that gave my brother and I detention. So here goes-- I'm just kidding. These are teachers that changed my life. Most of them public school teachers. Miss Dumei, Mr. Tool, Mr. Hudson, Mr. Chambers, Madame George, Miss NFL Ken, she's been mere to tochi, Joan Darling, and Edith Hallman. You guys educated me, you inspired me, and you've taught me to be less of a butt head. Your turn. All right, my fast feel. I never thought of myself as a screenwriter or a storyteller and never thought it was good enough. I have self-esteem problems. I have to thank all the people. Yes. So-- [LAUGHTER] Oh, God, guys. My imposter syndrome is at an all-time high. I need to thank the people who made me the storyteller that I am starting with my mom who protected me as a child, protected the inner storyteller. My mom is sitting here somewhere here. I don't know where she is. Thank you for all the sacrifices you gave me. My wife who protects me every day from the most negative thoughts I have, especially when I'm writing, and especially when you think Daniel Shiner, who is my confidence. He is the person who told me I was a storyteller and a filmmaker before I could even say that myself. And I would not be here without him. So thank you, guys. Thank you so much. And today, fellow nominees, thank you so much, guys. Thank you. [APPLAUSE] And now, to the brilliant screenwriters who applied their points of view to the work of a Canadian author, iconic movie characters of the past, a German war novel, a puzzle who done. it, and even a Japanese film based on an American film by Leo Tolstoy.

Miriam Taves wrote an essential novel about a radical act of democracy in which people who don't agree on every single issue managed to sit together in a room and carve out a way forward together, free of violence. They do so not just by talking but also by listening. The last line of our film is delivered by a young woman to a new baby, and she says, Your story will be different from ours. It's a promise, a commitment, and an anchor, and it's what I would like to say with all of my mic to my three incredible kids, Eve, Eila, and Amy as they make their way through this complicated, beautiful world. Thank you to the best man I've ever known. David Sandamersky, for giving me the optimism to believe we can and will do better.

Message and data rates may apply. From Glass Onion, please welcome Janelle Monet and Oscar nominee Kate Hudson with the Oscar for Sound. [applause] Cinema may be a visual medium, but there's a reason movies didn't stay silent for long. Sound teams transform images into fully dimensional moments by designing, recording, mixing, and editing. Everything you hear. Yeah, and we mean everything. Sure, the Batmobile sounds awesome, but someone has to figure out what Batman's garage door sounds like. That's right, Kate. And someone also has to make if 18 sound kind of if 18 is, right? Totally.

Thank you, Academy. And thank you to everyone who saw and heard this film together in theaters. [APPLAUSE] Thank you to our incredibly collaborative filmmakers, our director, Joe Kuzinski, and our producers, Jerry Brokheimer, Tom Cruise, Tommy Harper, Chris McQuarry.

[APPLAUSE] Thank you, and we are the best. [APPLAUSE] And we are the best. [APPLAUSE] Thank you. [APPLAUSE] Thank you. Namaste. [APPLAUSE] [MUSIC] Here's two time Academy Award nominee, John Friblty. [MUSIC] [APPLAUSE]. Okay, so in this industry, we have the rare luxury of getting to do what we love for living. And sometimes getting to do it with people that we come to love. And since tonight is a celebration of the work and the accomplishments of our community in this past year, it is only fitting, then that we celebrate those we've lost. Who've dedicated their lives to their craft both in front of and behind the camera through their immeasurable contributions, each of them left an individual and in debau wark that shared and informed us. They've touched our hearts, they've made us smile and became dear friends. Who we will always remain hopelessly devoted to. [APPLAUSE] So here, to honor them with a very special performance, please welcome the incomparable Lenny Cravitz. [APPLAUSE] [MUSIC] Calling all angels, I need you to look round.

[MUSIC] [MUSIC] [MUSIC] [MUSIC] [MUSIC] [MUSIC] [APPLAUSE] [MUSIC] [APPLAUSE] [MUSIC] Please welcome, Zoe Saldana and three-time Oscar nominee, Sigourney Weaver. [MUSIC] We may have come a long way from actually cutting and pasting film together by hand. But editing remains one of the most complex parts of the storytelling process. The characters have to comb through hours and hours of footage and decide which takes to make the movie and which wound up on the cutting room floor. And whether working with a massive machine like this one or a computer, editors still accomplish the same amazing feat. Translating time, rhythm and performance into a compelling story on screen. Here are the nominees for Achievement in Film Editing. The band-cheese of Inicherin, Michael E. G. Nelson. Elvis, Matt Villa, and Jonathan Redman. [MUSIC] Everything everywhere all at once, Paul Rogers. [MUSIC] Tom Monika Vili. Top Gun Maverick, Eddie Hamilton. And the Oscar goes to everything everywhere. [APPLAUSE] Editor Paul Rogers, met the Daniels, directors of everything everywhere all at once, a Daniel Shiner's birthday party. [APPLAUSE] [APPLAUSE] Oh, thank you. Wow, this is too much. This is my second film, y'all. This is crazy. [LAUGHTER] I have to think my wife, the most incredible woman in the room. My family, my mama's up here somewhere. I don't know, she'll scream. There she is. [LAUGHTER] My parallax family, Luke Lynch, my team, Ashish, Zukun, Jing, and Carrie up there. [APPLAUSE] And Dan and Daniel, wherever you are, yeah, there you are. I hope you know, look, your friends, the people who care about you. We're not here because of the incredible, wonderful, strange, beautiful movies you make. We're here because you guys are incredible, kind, generous, strange, sexy people. And we'll be here if all this goes away, we're still here with you. To the cast, it's been the honor of my career to work with you. I hope I did right by you. I care deeply about every one of you. So, yeah, thank you. [APPLAUSE] [MUSIC PLAYING] [APPLAUSE] Not only was Paul's second movie, he edited the whole thing while completely tripping on ayahuasca. I think that's very impressive. Anyone who's ever received the text message from their father knows how important editing is. [LAUGHTER] To amazing things. Editors can turn 44,000 hours of violent insurrection footage into a respectful sightseeing tour of the Capitol. [APPLAUSE] Their work is under appreciated. And now here to present the award for directing, Idris Elba and Oscar winner Nicole Kidman. [MUSIC PLAYING] [APPLAUSE]. At the very first Oscar's two awards were presented for directing, one for comedy, and one for drama. But the following year, the directing awards were combined to acknowledge that the genre of a movie isn't what matters most. Rather, the vision and skill of the filmmaker bringing the story to the big screen. The Mark of a cinematic genius is to craft an experience that none only entertains us for a few hours, but also stays with us for a lifetime. And reminds us why we fell in love with the movies. Here are the nominees for Achievement in Directed. Martin McDonough, the band she's a miniserant, Daniel Quon, and Daniel Shynett, everything love you wherever they want. Steven Spielberg, the Fabermans, Todd Field, Tarr, Ruben Oostland, Triangle of Sadness. [APPLAUSE] All right. And the Oscar goes to everything everywhere all the way to the standard Gondola to Daniel Shynard. Known collectively as the Daniels, Daniel Quon and Daniel Shynard, Met While Studying at an Emerson College in Boston, We began their career as music video directors. Oh my god. Thank you, sir. Our fellow nominees, you guys are our heroes. This is weird. We wanted to dedicate this to the mommies, all the mommies in the world, to our moms. Specifically, my mom and dad, Ken and Becky, thank you for not squashing my creativity when I was making really disturbing horror films, or really perverted comedy films or dressing in drag as a kid, which is a threat to nobody. [APPLAUSE] And yeah, thank you to everybody who worked on our movie. I know every director agrees with me when I say a director is nothing without their incredible cast and crew. This is my family, my friends. If our movie has greatness in genius, it is only because they have greatness in genius flowing through their hearts and souls and minds, and they gave it to us to our-- they gave that precious gift to our film. The world is opening up to the fact that genius does not stem from individuals like us on stage, but rather genius emerges from the collective. We are all products of our context. We are all descendants of something and someone, and I want to acknowledge my context. My immigrant parents, my father, who fell in love with movies because he needed to escape the world and thus pass that love of movies onto me. My mother, who is a creative soul, who wanted to be a dancer, an actor, and singer, but could not afford the luxury of that life path, and then gave it to me, my incredible brothers and sisters, who helped me survive the chaos of childhood, my friends from high school, who taught me the-- Sorry, I'm just going to keep going. [LAUGHTER] On a CCC, you taught me the liberating freedom of creativity and joy and your DNA's in this film as well. My incredible son, Geo, she rearranged my DNA every day, and it's awful and beautiful every single time. [LAUGHTER] If you ever watch this, I hope you know that you should never have to live up to the standard. This is not normal. This is kind of crazy. I will love you no matter what. [LAUGHTER] [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] [LAUGHTER] And lastly, I just want to go back to my original point. There is greatness in every single person. It doesn't matter who they are. You have a genius that is waiting to erupt. So you just need to find the right people to unlock that. Thank you so much to everyone who has unlocked my genius. This means so much to us. Thank you to the Academy. [APPLAUSE] [MUSIC PLAYING] Coming up, Jessica Chastain and Halle Berry, the actor and lead actress. Plus, Paris and Ford presents Best Picture. [MUSIC PLAYING] [APPLAUSE] We're back to the Oscars. Congratulations to the Daniels on. They're joint win for directing. I won a great speech. So many great speeches. And I, you know, there was a time in this country when two men wouldn't have been allowed to share custody of an Oscar. And I think it's wonderful. We've come such a long way. Did you know, though, this interesting, the last directing team to win an Oscar was Congressman George Santos. [LAUGHTER] We only have three awards left to go, but we're going to stretch them out and really make a meal out of them. [LAUGHTER] Here to present actor and actress in a leading role, please welcome Oscar winners, Jessica Chastain and Halle Berry. [APPLAUSE] [MUSIC PLAYING] [APPLAUSE] [MUSIC PLAYING] [APPLAUSE] [APPLAUSE] [APPLAUSE]. [LAUGHTER] When an actor or actress first approaches a role, we use every tool at our disposal to help us create the world of the character. You can find valuable pieces of insight from anything around you. The script, the director, your fellow actors, the costume, everything. Yet it's what a performer brings to the role personally that truly forges that character into existence. These nominees showed intelligent curiosity and a commitment to revealing their character's humanity and every aspect of their portrayals. Here are the nominees for performance by an actor and a leading role. Austin Butler, Elvis. [APPLAUSE] [MUSIC PLAYING] [APPLAUSE] [MUSIC PLAYING] All right. Ready to fly. [MUSIC PLAYING] [APPLAUSE] Colin Farrell, the band-shoes of Inashia. I wish to take out a nice look at me. Nice good guys. [MUSIC PLAYING] No, it was to be nice. Did you never use to be? Oh, God. Maybe you never use to be. [APPLAUSE] Brendan Fraser, the way of. You're an amazing person that I couldn't ask for a more incredible daughter. Are you actually trying to parent me right now? Ellie, look at me. Who would want me to be a part of their life? [APPLAUSE] Paul Meskell, after some. Never know where you'll end up. You can never write up for your own to live. You can hear whoever you want to be. You've time. [MUSIC PLAYING]. [APPLAUSE] Will now live in. I just had help. This small wonder I didn't notice. What I was becoming. And then I don't remember what it was like to be alive. You've only to be alive like that for one day. [APPLAUSE] And the Oscar goes to. Brendan Fraser. [APPLAUSE] As a child, Brendan Fraser developed an interest in acting after seeing a rest-in performance of the musical Oliver. [MUSIC PLAYING] [APPLAUSE] [APPLAUSE] Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] [APPLAUSE] So this is what the multiverse looks like. [LAUGHTER]. Oh, my goodness. I thank the Academy for this honor and for our studio H24 for making such a bold film. And I'm grateful to Darren Ironowski for throwing me a creative lifeline and hauling me aboard the good ship, the whale. There is written by Samuel D. Hunter, who is our lighthouse. [APPLAUSE] Gentlemen, you laid your whale-sized hearts bare so that we could see into your souls like no one else could do. And it is my honor to be named alongside you in this category. [APPLAUSE] I want to tell you that only whales can swim at the depth of the talent of Hongchao. [APPLAUSE] I started in this business 30 years ago, and things didn't come easily to me, but there was a facility that I didn't appreciate at the time until it stopped. And I just want to say thank you for this acknowledgment, because it couldn't be done without my cast. It's been like I've been on a diving expedition on the bottom of the ocean and the air on the line to the surface. It's on a launch. It's been watched over by some people in my life, like my friend, I'm a little bit older than I was born. I'm a little bit older than I was born. I'm a little bit older than I was born. I'm a little bit older than I was born. I'm a little bit older than I was born. I'm a little bit older than I was born. I'm a little bit older than I was born. I'm a little bit older than I was born. I'm a little bit older than I was born. I'm a little bit older than I was born. I'm a little bit older than I was born. [APPLAUSE] I don't think I want to do anything. I'm a little bit older than I was born. And now, here are the nominees for Performance by an Actress in a Leading Rule. Kate Blanchard, Tar. You want to dance the mask. You must service the composer. You've got to supplement yourself. And yes, your identity. You must in fact stand in front of the public and God and obliterate yourself. [APPLAUSE] Hello, de la nes. Blonde. Imagine. You belong. I hope people love you. They want you. Just die the law. And it's worth anything. [APPLAUSE] Andrea Riesbrough, to listen. It's been too much my life. I've had him with people. I don't even know. I've done with hiding. I'm done with being run off. I don't want to be a good mama. I won't be a good mama again. [APPLAUSE] Michelle Williams, the fables. I've spelt my countless faults. I'm not ruining everything for everyone. I'm going to not be selfish. [SIGHS] I'm going to be your mom. [APPLAUSE] Michelle Yo, everything only your audience. Maybe there is something out there.

This is proof that dreams dream big and dreams do come true. And ladies, don't let anybody tell you you are ever past your prime. [APPLAUSE] I wouldn't be standing here tonight without the Daniels, without A24, without my amazing cast and crew, without everyone who was involved with everything everywhere, all at once. But I have to dedicate this to my mom, all the moms in the world, because they are really the superheroes. And without them, none of us will be here tonight. [APPLAUSE] Oh, man. She's 84, and I'm taking this home to her. She's watching right now in Malaysia, K.L. with my family and friends. I love you guys. I'm bringing this home to you. [APPLAUSE] And also to my extended family in Hong Kong, where I started my career. Thank you for letting me stand on your shoulders, giving me a leg up so that I can be here today. And to my God, children, to my sisters, all of them to my brothers, to God, to my family. Thank you. Thank you. [APPLAUSE] Thank you to the Academy. This is history in the making. Thank you. [MUSIC PLAYING]. And now, please welcome Academy Award nominee, Harris and Ford. [APPLAUSE] [MUSIC PLAYING] From intimate stories to blockbusters, the films nominated for our final award tonight brought movie theaters around the world back to theaters, whether providing a few hours of welcome escape, or the opportunity to connect emotionally with different cultures, or inspiring reflection, encouraging empathy. Movies can transform our lives. The movies we honor tonight have real power. Once again, here are the nominees for Best Picture. All quiet on the Western Front, avatar, the way of water, the banches of English sharing, Elvis, everything everywhere, all at once, the fabled ones, or tar, top gun, and never trying to save us women talking.

[APPLAUSE] [MUSIC PLAYING] [APPLAUSE] This feels incredible. There is no movie without our brilliant and big-hearted cast and crew, but not just these beautiful souls here. Also up there, and in Little Tokyo, we see you. So this award is ours. I really-- it is intimidating speaking up here. Let me just tell you that. I never thought I would get to say this, so I say it with one voice with all these people. Thank you to the Academy. A24. Thank you so much. You saw our weirdness and supported us for a year, theatrically. That's incredible. Thank you. To my brilliant and beautiful wife, Ani. If all this shiny stuff in Tuxedo's goes away, I would just love to do laundry and taxes with you for the rest of my life. [LAUGHTER] But this is for my dad, who, like so many immigrant parents, died young. And he is so proud of me, not because of this-- because we made this movie with what he taught me to do, which is no person is more important than profits. And no one is more important than anyone else. And these weirdos right here supported me in doing that. Wong-Daa, Zang, memory eternal. Daniel, I don't know what to say. I love you guys. You just won Best Picture. Hey. We've said enough tonight. I just want to say that thank you so much to everyone. Here, you have all inspired me. I think one of the things that I realized growing up was that one of the best things we can do for each other is shelter each other from the chaos of this crazy world we live in. Thank you to the storytellers here who did that for me. The world is changing rapidly. And I'm fear that our stories are not keeping pace. And I sometimes it's a little scary knowing that movies move at the rate of years and the world on the Internet is moving at the rate of milliseconds. But I have great faith in our stories. These stories have changed my life. And they've done that for generations. And I know that we'll get through this. Have a great night, guys. Thank you so much. Thank you. Everyone have a good night. Thank you for watching. [APPLAUSE] That's it. We did a great work crisis team. I want to thank the Thanks to the Academy for having me again. It has been an honor to be here with you.
