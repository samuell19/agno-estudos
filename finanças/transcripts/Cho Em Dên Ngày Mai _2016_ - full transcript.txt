So please enjoy your meal. Hi, auntie! A full-size sandwich please. Here you go. -Thank you. -You're welcome. Hey girl, aren't you afraid of getting mugged while travelling? No, I take this route everyday. There's never been a thief. There's one today. You're even broker than I am. You nutjob! You son of a bitch! Sushi. We're having dinner, put it down please. Sushi is hungry. Ok ok, go go. It's fine. You should not touch dogs too much. Ok, it's fine, baby. Let's eat. Don't eat spring rolls. Oily food is bad for your voice. This one is spicy, so it's no better. Give it to me. You should drink more juice instead of wine. We'll get into the movie business, so it's better if you do what I say. Cherry, I'm a singer. I just want to sing, I don't want to act. Did you hear what I just said? Okay. Also, I think it's time to make our relationship official to the public. Cherry. Let me ask you honestly. Do you think you can live without me? I don't know if I can live without you, But I know for sure you cannot without me. Kevin! Kevin! Where are you going? Restroom. Why do you keep following me? Oh! You don't remember me? Did you just talk? Yes, turn me back please. Calm down, hear me out. Once in a while we drink When we drink we go all the way When we're drunk we don't behave When we're drunk we don't behave Old friend! Oh the... the dog! The dog. Get it! -Dog... -Get it. That's the story. You said I'm a dog so I turned into one. Now, you just need to say I'm human and I'll turn back into one. You human! Human! Oh, why am I still a dog? See, nothing. Stop trying to trick me. I'm not lying to you, can't you see only you can understand what I'm saying? Because you're not barking, you're speaking. But to everyone else I'm barking. Stop talking. It's karma, you deserve it. You're evil. Please help me. Fine! Where are you going? Sleep outside. But it's cold out here. I don't understand. if the dog really is the thief... I do hope he turns back. And if he's gonna go to jail... that can be later. Besides, you should wash your hands with soap Ahhh! Why are you here, dude? Thief! Shut up, are you kidding me? "Dude"? Why you... Why are you here? You forgot that fast? Son of a bitch! Hey, don't be stupid. Go away, you dog thief. No need to say, I'm gonna go, I need to make a living. I'll call the police. They're not that free. See ya. -Thank you. -Thanks. Focus. Hello, may I take your order? Hey pretty lady, I want combo five. 80 thousand please. Thank you. I'm so hungry. Do you think dogs can speak? Not like "woof, woof!", but like us. -Are you insane? -Hey, I want to order. Can I pay now? Yes, which ones have you ordered? I just told you. -You did? -Yes. Yours is 415 thousand. I just ordered these, you must have gotten it wrong. How come it's that much? I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, but did you order this one, this one, this smoothie, and this one too? Stop arguing. We don't want it now, give us a refund. She didn't get it wrong. Who the hell are you? How would you know? Because I was standing here and saw with my own eyes, you told her you wanted this and this. You ordered the whole menu, no wonder it's that much. If you're on her side, pay for it. Fine, I'll pay for you. Sorry. Kevin? Kevin! It's really you, Kevin! Yay! I get to meet Kevin! It's Kevin..Kevin! Kevin! Kevin! Kevin! -Here's your chicken! -Thank you, pretty girl! I'll be always be close to you Always be a warm embrace Food is here. It's good. Where's the chicken? Which chicken? Fried chicken. Fried chicken wings with fish sauce? Fried chicken. Yeah, fried chicken. Cherry said fast food is no good for you, so I got "slow food". Here! Oyster, fish fin, gourmet stuff, best of the Tonkin Gulf. Twelve-hour stew, best of the best. Please have some, Kevin. You can have it all. Now you guys even manage my diet. Kevin! You're wrong. What a wonderful day. He touched my hand. I probably will never forget that moment. But thinking about that thief and the dog yesterday, I'm a little bit frightened. Maybe he's a weredog. If I see that dog-thief again, I have to solve the mystery. You again? Why are you still here? You're cruel. I was having dinner, then boom, I was under the table again. Then it has nothing to do with me. I didn't meet you yesterday. But only you can understand what I'm saying! That's right. Then, only me can turn you back. Right? Exactly! But it depends. Depends on what? Oh, what's your name? I can't keep calling you dog, it's weird. It's Mit on my ID, like jackfruit. I go by One-Eyed Mit. My Facebook says "Seedless Beautiful Jackfruit." Which do you prefer? Mit! Mit! You have to behave. Do not mess around! Understand? Don't chase the neighbor's cat! Don't go out onto the street. Around here, there are a lot of dog meat restaurants. Got it? Then you'll turn me back? No way. What else do you want me to do? You can't do it. I have a family to take care of. I need to be human. Just tell me, I'll do anything. I want to be Kevin Vu's girlfriend. Kevin Vu! That dude who sings dumb music? You're dumb. He's a music star. So can you do it or not? Gosh! This is a tough one. I don't think it's hard. I think he really likes me. Think about it. Why would a music star go buy fast food himself? And why would he even help me when I was in trouble? It is all because he likes me. What are you doing? Peeing! Haven't seen a dog pee before? There's a lady here. I never know someone so rude. You deserve to be a dog. There's no dog who can pee with manners like me. Fast food girl goes to events? It's more than just an event. I will see him today. Should I wear make-up or keep it natural? Oh, I know. I'll wear a dress to show my legs. And smile a lot to show teeth. You should turn me back. You can't do it. Bring me with you. Famous dudes like chicks with pets. I don't need a thief. You're staying home. Aren't you afraid he might have a girlfriend already? Dogs can't understand humans. Get out. I need to change. Kevin. Do you remember me? I'm from the fried chicken shop. I'm here to say thank you. I remember now, you sell jewelry at Kim Bien market, don't you? I came for some stones... -...and you gave me drinks. -No. I sell fried chicken. This is my first gift to Kevin. I know you sell fried chicken. Kevin has an event this afternoon, you can just email him. Or you can inbox him on his 18-million-like fanpage. Okay? You're so cute. He'll reply to you next year. Haha, what a nut. You're crazy. I met her at the fried chicken shop. She's nicer than you think. I was kidding. Ly, what's wrong? Did something happen? Just tell me! It's the singer, isn't it? I told you but you didn't believe me. He forgot about me. It makes sense. There's nothing memorable about me. But you're a good girl... and good people always get good luck. Is it really you, Mit? It seems that you're cuter as a dog. Am I so unlikable as a human? Of course, but still better than him. Come with me for a bit? Where are we going? Hey, there are a lot of choices. Why don't you get a job instead of mugging people? That's my fate. I tried all kinds of jobs but always got fired. Motorbike taxi didn't pay enough, I got into debt, so I robbed people. It's like I have a gift. I'm blessed with it. Yeah, that's why you're a dog now. You're not in my shoes. You wouldn't know. My grandpa, he's been paralyzed for five years, but he still can hear and talk. Who is that? Hi grandpa! I'm Ly, Mit's friend, Mit asked me to bring you dinner. Does he have a night shift today? Yes grandpa. He and I work at the same place. Would you like to have dinner now? Are you Mit's girlfriend? Since he got the stroke, he's been weak. I'm really worried about him, he's the only one I have. I thought you're for him to lean on. No, I always make him sad. But if it wasn't for him, I would be even worse than I am now. It seems like everybody has someone to lean on in hard times. Yeah, he wants me to have a girlfriend. He keeps bringing it up. No girl would want a thief boyfriend. Girls are only into handsome celebrities. I'm not in love with Kevin because he's a star. I love him because I can see the passion he has for singing, and his sincerity towards people around him. And now another thing I found out is he has warm hands. Hey, if I help you, You've got to turn me back. You saw my grandpa. Your grandpa wouldn't want you to be a thief. I'll quit. I'll get a proper job. But first, I'll go back to driving a motorbike taxi. To be honest... I don't know how to turn you back. Stop kidding! I'm not kidding! I don't know how you keep turning into a dog and back. I'll help you be friends with Kevin Vu, and you turn me back for good, OK? I've been researching thoroughly. He likes pets. Especially dogs. He carries a poodle everywhere he goes. Every Tuesday, he walks his dog. I will lure that female dog. Kevin Vu will chase after her and meet you. An accidental meeting... This chance encounter will hopefully impress him. If you're really cute, he'll ask you out. And when it's done, you turn me back. Hey, it's a street dog, chase him away or he'll give Sushi bugs. What are you doing, get away. That's so gross. Try to scare me? Hey, hey. He's biting Sushi! Hey, let go. I didn't know he was a male and fierce. Good thing I know Kung Fu. What? Are you teasing me? That's it, I'm not helping you anymore. Hey, the mission isn't accomplished yet. Can't you see I almost died? But you're better now, aren't you? Nevermind, get some rest. But I'll say this: you have to help me so you can turn back into a human. What's next? The plan is you take care of my grandpa. And I... I'm gonna get some sleep. Fine, sleep. Ok, so you guys gonna freeze so he can show off his skills, okay? Too many late nights, bro. Let's call it a day, you guys can go. See you. Do you know what you just did? Do you know how big this movie project is? But it's not music. You know you've just thrown away the whole crew's effort the past two months? Cherry, I've told you from the beginning, I don't like it. I'm building your brand, it's not up to you to like it or not. What am I to you? A star, and my man. Or a toy? You're controlling me, you know that? You never care about my feelings. I don’t care? Then who has taken care of everything for you from the beginning? All these years. I'm wrong. Yes, I'm an orphan who was raised by your family. I'll never forget that, Cherry! I'm sorry. I was wrong. Why do we have to be like this? Why can't we talk and love each other like normal people? Don't be like that, please? Then let's get married. You're not mad anymore, right? Please apologize to everyone at the press conference tomorrow. Fine, up to you. I will try to lead a decent life. I will have a girlfriend. Please, don't worry. EMERGENCY ROOM So? When am I gonna die? You won't die unless you're struck by lightning. Don't worry. You will live long. Why do I keep getting headaches? With your working schedule, skipping meals, no wonder you're sick. Here. Anytime you have a headache and feel nauseous, take this. Come back tomorrow and I'll give you a blood test. What about that live show of yours? How's it going? It's pretty good. Gonna be huge this year. Don't forget to come. Where's my ticket? Yeah, we've started selling tickets. Don't forget to buy some. Thanks for the pills. Have I done something to Mit? He still believes I have the power to turn him back into a human. Apart from the night he tried to rob me, he's actually a pretty decent guy. If I had that power, I'd have turned him back long ago. I'm sorry. This will be the last time I steal. If I don't have money, I can't help you. Have you seen One-Eyed Mit lately? Don't talk about him. I'm so disappointed. Bros don't let each other down. He's not a quitter. But I don't know where he's been lately. -Hey? -What? One-Eyed Mit! It's him. Yeah. You smell really bad, dude. Like a dog or something? Dog? We thought you left us for good. It's a long story. I don’t even know what's going on. But... I have something really urgent that needs your help. Anything for One-Eyed Mit. It's Kevin Vu. He's better-looking in person. Kevin Vu. Are you guys with me or with him? He's asking you. I feel like we're doing him wrong. Me too. Just let it be. Pay attention! Open the door. Open it. What's special about this live show? I will perform three new songs and sing with three guest singers from Thailand, Japan, and Korea. Anything else? What else? Do you want me to bring a helicopter on stage? I think... in this show the best thing I can bring to my audience is ...music. That's it? Ladies and gentlemen. The show will be live on major channels at prime-time. At the end of the show, there will be a surprise for millions of people, especially the fangirls. Kevin's going to introduce his secret girlfriend. Oh, secret girlfriend. That's not all. There's more news I'm telling you exclusively. No one knows. It'll hit the headlines. There's... a fabulous wedding next year. -Wow. -Is Kevin getting married? Is it Minh Ha, the singer? Or is it Kieu Khanh, the model? Or is it Ngoc Thuy, the dancer? Rumor has it you're back with your ex? Is it Kathy Nguyen, the model? Sorry, everyone, I need to take this call. Don't go. Ladies and gentlemen, I'll answer your questions on behalf of Kevin. Hit it, Chien. Who the hell are you? Haven't slept enough lately, have you? Hit it! I can't reach the brakes. Then you do it. I'm no different than him. Hi, table for? -Is the food ready? -Almost done. One? Would you like combo one, four, or five? Combo two for table one. Combo five gets you an extra piece of chicken and fries for only five thousand. Can you double your shift next week? Yes! OK! Please have a seat. The food will be ready shortly. Let me help you. Yes. How about... we hire a male staff member? I've already asked, waiting for the boss' approval. OK. Can I get this one quickly? This one? You're famous just for singing those crappy songs? What? Not answering, huh? Ignoring me? Ignoring me? Do whatever you need to find him. He's acting up. It's time to replace him with someone who knows how to behave. I love him. I know you, Cherry. You can control everything. Even your heart. Even your love. I've got a few replacement options. Take a looK. Here. 1m75 with a six-pack. 1m76 with a two-pack. 1m77 with a four-pack. Enough! How are you gonna blackmail him? What the hell are you doing? Are you crazy? I told you I was just helping that girl. Is that doing you any good? I don't even know how to explain. In short, it's a crime for a good cause. Wow, that's pretty smart. Now what? Here's the money. What money? Forget it. The money isn't important to us. We don't want it, you can keep it. You two, return the car to the owner. Don't forget the driver in the garbage truck. Oh yeah. -OK. -OK. Yeah! I'm so happy today. Mit came home and told me a lot of things. He said he has a stable job now. Oh, when did Mit turn back into a human? What are you saying? I don't understand. Oh! Nothing! Did Mit say anything else? He said he got a girlfriend. She sounds like you. Probably not. It must be you. White skin, slim, a broad forehead, and bright smile. It must be you. Don't you like my grandson? He's a poor kid. But he's not been blessed. Having to take care of me is bad luck. Please don't say that. Thanks to you, Mit is where he is now. You do like him then. Actually I have a boyfriend. Yes! Mit's running out of luck again. This week... Hi uncle. -Hi auntie. -Hi there! You went shopping? Yes! 'Cause you're everything Take care of the singer. Don't turn me into a dog again. This guy! Gosh! Hey! Kevin! Calm down. Calm down please. We've met, don't you remember? I didn't do this. I'm not a bad person. Take it easy. I'll untie you then. Oh my... Mom. I'm sorry. You're the fast food girl. You recognize me? Why did you kidnap me? I just wanted to meet you. Then I told my friend. And he thought of this stupid joke. I didn't think of it. I'm sorry. Sorry is not good enough. What do I have to do now? I'm hungry. Make some food. Huh? It's so good. I haven't had a fried egg in so long. Thank you. You're friendlier than I thought. Not really. Cause you're a good person. How would you know? I've been watching you. Since when? I bought fried chicken at your store every day. I thought celebrities didn't like fried chicken. Oh God, you even have that CD? That's my debut CD. Back then I was nobody. You can't find a copy now. I have everything about you. It's only you that I don't have. What's your name? My name is Ly. You like me, don't you? No, I'm just your fan. You do like me. Don't kidnap me next time. No, I won't kidnap you again. I want you to want to come here by yourself. That's pretty confident of you. You like me too, don't you? -Where have you been? -You... I just got back from work. Why are you here? Don't ask. All you need to know is I'm staying here tonight. You... Honey... Why? Can we not do it today? I'm a little bit tired. Why are you smiling? Nothing. I'm not joking around. I told you, I'm tired. I don't want to. How about you sleep alone tonight? Please go home. What's wrong with you? How come you're human again? Who knows. How was that? I'm happy. We cooked then ate together. He was friendlier than I thought. Don't worry. If you keep behaving, I won't turn you into a dog anymore. I'm not worried. I'm worried about you. He's a famous singer. You've read the news, you must know. Famous singers can never be trusted in love. Please don't say that. He's serious. I can feel it. You can? I'm telling you. If he tricks you, I won't let it slide. If you touch my Kevin, I will turn you back into a dog. Sorry. A thief like me doesn't deserve you. I'm gonna head back. I don't stand a chance. What chance? Kevin Vu answered the press this morning saying he's going to introduce his true love next live concert. Look at yourself. Even if he's single, he's out of your league. A music star and a fast food girl? It's just a fairy tale. Hi, which combo would you like? IT'S ME. What else would you like? DO YOU WANT TO HANG OUT? -Surprise! -God! Two tickets please. It's gonna be scary, brace yourself. I'm here for you. I'm not in yet. Ly? Kevin. Open the door, Ly! Are you ok? I fell, I got a cramp. -Open the door. -I fell because I couldn't see. Push! I can't get in. Did you have fun today? Hey, can I ask? Why do you like fried chicken so much? Because it was the last dish I got to eat before I was put into the orphanage. I thought your parents were rich. Not really. It's all rumors. I'm not as happy as they say. I've never had a family. Until now I'm still like other orphans. I don't understand why my parents abandoned me. Do you know what my biggest dream is? It's to eat fried chicken. To sing. I had to give up a lot just to sing. Do you know what my biggest dream is? To sell fried chicken? I'm sorry, go ahead. It's for this moment to last forever. Can we save it? But how? Keep it here. I want to bring you to a special place. Where are you taking me? PLEASE SOFTEN YOUR VOICE AND WATCH YOUR STEPS. THANK YOU! This is my secret spot. I bought it from a friend. He's an architect. Isn't it beautiful? This place feels familiar, like I've seen it somewhere. It's so comfortable. Come here. Oh, watch out, sorry. These are memories, of all the places I've been through, and the secrets. No way. Have a seat. You will be the only guest today. Welcome to Kevin's tea room. Welcome, dear guest. Welcome to the one-guest-only performance. Please place your order. Thank you. Got it. Let us begin. Oh, I remember now. Everything is like what I imagined and wrote in my diary. The only thing missing is riding a bicycle down a breezy road. Were you listening? Yes. Which part was I singing? Hello? Where are you? Where love begins. Can you get here immediately? What, you want free tickets? I'm feeling good today, I'll give you ten. It's not that. Please come at once. You have to go now? PLEASE WEAR THIS DRESS AND COME. PERHAPS YOU DON'T REALIZE, BUT I LOVE YOU. We still need a few more tests. You know, science is advanced. There'll be a lot of ways to cure it. I'm not a patient. I'm your friend. We found out a bit late, but if you actively cooperate, it'll definitely be OK. What if it doesn't work? Are you working? Yes. Your grandpa told me you came here early this morning. Any customers? It's probably not for me. No customers whatsoever. I'm missing the good old days. Ta-da! will you come with me? What do I do if he reveals his real love and people chase after you? Stand there like an idiot? But I don't want to go alone, please go with me. Please? Do you have nice clothes to wear yet? I'll borrow my friends'. It's time, let's go. Cherry mentioned the wedding announcement. It's packed here. Follow me this way. Let's go. Kevin said just her. Let's go. Kevin! What can you say...? Miss... I have a question. Okay. Okay. Right now, I just want to enjoy Kevin Vu's amazing songs. You can email your questions to my manager. Where? Are you all right? -Are you ok? -What's wrong? I'm fine. Take off your shirt. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Did the concert tonight please you? Thank you, to be honest, I've spent my whole life singing love songs, but it's not easy to know what it's like to truly live and love. I haven't been fortunate to meet many people who love me. But if there's someone who can make me fall in love, I'll love them with all my heart. Wholeheartedly, truthfully. You know, I get to stand on this stage in the spotlights, receiving applause, but in only a few minutes, I will be back home again by myself among four walls. Lonely in the dark. And I thought my whole life I'd never be able to escape that darkness. Until you came. You've brought warm sunlight into my life. Thank you. Thank you for making me smile, for bringing light into my life, showing me what love is and how to live for someone. But ladies and gentlemen, love and gratitude are two completely different things. It hurts when people confuse one with the other. But for me, Kevin Vu, I'm scared. Today, I would like to introduce you to my love, my only love. It's... It's music. And the audience. There will be no girl. My one and only love is music. Thank you. Hey. Do you want to have supper with us? Come with us. You guys go ahead. I'm a bit tired. Alright, see you. Let's go. What am I to you? Oh God. Kevin... Cherry was right to do that. You're wrong. In the Southern part of the country... You haven't eaten for two days. Don't you want to live anymore? Where do you want to go? I can't forget him if I keep staying here. I'll go somewhere far away. You're not going anywhere. Leave me alone. I'm too tired. Go away. That dog. Why don't you turn him into a dog? I've told you countless times I don't have magic. Stop bothering me. I don't get you. What's so good about him? Why do you have to suffer for him? Because I love him. I'm stupid. Is that good enough for you? I will kill him. If you touch him, I'll turn you back into a dog. I dare you. What's this? You want to drive me crazy? KEVIN VU ANNOUNCES RETIREMENT I simply want to have a life. You can take back everything. I just want you to be a star. I don't think it's for me. You should find someone else. I'm too tired. You're really stressed, aren't you? If you're exhausted, let's take a break. Let's travel. Where do you want to go? Hawaii? Or France? Or Italy? Do you want to go mountain climbing? Answer me. I don't want to go anywhere. I think I love someone else. I'm sorry. How could you say that? Do you know what you're talking about? Okay. I know I'm a handful. I know you're tired, but please don't lie to me. I'm telling the truth, Cherry. I begged you many times to let me love you. Why didn't you let me? I need a soulmate in love, and I can only feel it with her. I'm sorry. Ungrateful, uneducated... Cherry spoiled you. If it were up to me, you'd have been out on the street long time ago. You're always wrong, Kevin. You don't have to tell me that. Cherry is my savior. I don't want to be your savior. I just want to be your love. But you can't love someone who is dying. Kevin. This time, I'm wrong. Kevin. Those are lies. Kevin said that on purpose in the concert. He doesn't want you to get hurt. He's dying. What? Who's dying, say it slowly. And why are you a dog again? Sorry, who are you looking for? I'm looking for Kevin Vu! Kevin is not here. Do you know where Kevin is? I don't know, Kevin didn't tell me. I'm just looking after his place for him. Sorry. Who is that girl? She's an amazing person. You love her, don't you? Like never before. And I also have never wanted to live this much before. Why...? Is Kevin still in his room? Please, just let me see him even for a minute. Right now his mind is not clear. He needs to stay calm to get ready for the upcoming operation. Ly! Get inside, it's raining. DR. QUANG IS CALLING. Kevin, we'll wait for you. I have a new song written for you. Stay strong. Be strong. -Can you turn me around? -Sure. Kevin, be strong. Thank you! You're not allowed to die. It's an order. Yes ma'am. It's time. Let's go. Why? I've done everything for you. Yet it's not enough. Don't cry, Cherry. You're a strong woman. I don't want to see you like this. Stand up, Cherry. Hey, get up! Thank you for everything. I'm sorry. Is there anyone else you're waiting for? Kevin! He has to go into the operating room now. You have to sing for me. -Please go faster. -Yes. He will live. Dr. Quang said sometimes miracles happen. What about your magic? Why don't you help him? I told you, I don't have magical powers. It's your own imagination. So I turn myself into a dog, then a human over and over again? You did something. It's true there have been things that I couldn't comprehend. Like my diary for example. Obviously I was just writing these things down, and somehow they happened exactly the way I wrote. For example, I just imagined Kevin and I are going on a boat date. He took me to a secret place, and we cycled on the road. And it happened exactly the same. Hey, let me see. What's your name? Kevin. Kevin Vu. This is where I meet Kevin and he'll sing for me. We'll ride a bike on a breezy road. Show me the page before. This is the first time I see you. Who do you want to see first when you wake up? You wanted me to turn into a dog twice, and I did. Once you wanted me to turn back and I did. This diary has magic. But I've been using this for a year, and nothing happened before. Clearly everything you wrote came true. Turn back! Why do these pages have different ink colors? Because my old pen ran out of ink. Maybe it's the pen? The pen? This pen? Where did you get it? An old lady gave it to me. That's it. Remember the first time I tried to rob you? I got ink on my hand. Then you cursed at me saying I'm a son of... and I turned into one. The other day, you threw the pen at me, and I turned into a dog immediately. But sometimes, I only write things down and they come true. The most magical thing is its ink. Write! Help Kevin live. Hurry. If this pen is really magic, please let this writing save his life. Hello. Ly! I don’t understand what's happening, Kevin can stand and walk now. The test results show he's recovered completely. Really? Thank you! Thank you so much. Hey, he's no longer sick. What are you waiting for, turn me back. Thank you so much! I love you, Mit. Sit here. Write. Loud and clear. One-Eyed Mit is a good person. He deserves to be human. What's taking so long? I think the pen is out of ink. That's impossible. Ly, do something! Grandma! I came to see you and take the pen back. No! I need to help my friend. There's nothing else I can do for you. He's a good person who needs to take care of his grandpa. Please help him. You have chosen this pen from the start. Now it's out of ink. I'm begging you, please, help him. There's nothing else I can do. If we live well, our good deeds will come back to us. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry! Mit! Where are you going? Mit... Mit! If we live well, all our good deeds will come back to us. Kevin. Kevin! Kevin! -Thief! -Thief! THE FOLLOWING DAY Honey, there's only one kind of star now. Entertainment star. It's your chance of a lifetime. You have to be number one. Number one. Do you like this role? Yes, I do! Then you take it. Kevin. -Are you blind? -I'm so sorry. -Do you know how to drive? -Calm down, let's sort this out. What kind of driving was that? Take your hand off him! Who is this girl? You can't... You're wrong and still want to argue about it? Who are you? You don't need to know. Either you go, or I'll take you to the police. Please, go. Just leave. Kevin, we're late honey. Can't you see their stuff everywhere? Help them. Me? Or I will? Are you okay? My hand just hurts a little. Please take this for your vegetables.
