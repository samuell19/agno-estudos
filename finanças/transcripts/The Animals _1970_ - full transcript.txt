(birds chirping) (hooves clomping) (soft adventurous music) - [Man] Whoa, whoa!

Afternoon, ladies. - [Man] If you don't shut up, I'll shackle you up top. - [Man] Now you wouldn't wanna deliver an innocent man for retrial all trail-worn, would ya? - [Man] Innocent. Hell, you're gonna hang. - [Man] Don't bet your saddle on that, Marshall. (laughs) (soft adventurous music) (hooves clomping) (coachman vocalizing) (coachman vocalizing) - [Man] Whoa. (horse whinnying) (birds chirping) - Alice, the tea's ready. Would you like another cup? - No, no thank you, Mrs. Perkins. - She died of pneumonia. - Pneumonia? - Yeah. - Who? - The teacher. - Oh. Do you miss school? - Nope. - It's no, not nope. - I know. You know, you don't look nothin' like a teacher. - [Alice] Oh, really? Just what do I look like? - Like a lady. - Well thank you. That's the nicest thing anybody ever said to me. - That's okay. - Do you know how to read? - Sure. - If I gave you a book for a present, would you promise to read it? - Sure. Does it have any pictures in it? - Yes, it has lots of pictures in it. - Sure, I can read it. But why do you wanna give me a present? - Because I like you. And anyways, it'll give me a great deal of pleasure to be able to give you something. - [Girl] Okay then. - Good, you stay right there. Would you kindly get out of my way? I have to get something. - My pleasure, ma'am. (soft adventurous music) (hooves clomping) - There she is. Let's get it! She's right down there about a mile or so. - I reckon, Pudge, you'd be glad to see us. (Pudge laughing) - [Man] Some questions. - Boggs, she'll sure be surprised. Let's get it on. C'mon! (vocalizes) (group shouting) (hooves clomping) (soft adventurous music) (hooves clopping) (guns blasting) - Get down, ladies. (guns blasting) - It's a holdup. Now stay down. (soft adventurous music) (guns blasting) - Hey you, pull off! Pull off them horses! Pull on over there. - I can't! - Stop them horses. Stop them horses! - I can't! - Put 'em guns down! Lower your guns! Get off of there! Get off of that stagecoach! Move! Move I said! - Greetings. Gentlemen, greetings. Helluva nice day, huh? - Move I said. C'mon, get out from there! (group shouting) - Now, come on. - Good to see ya. C'mon, hurry up. The man said move. Now move it. - (chuckles) Hey, pretty women. (gun blasting) (vocalizes) I love it. I love it. (sneezing) - All right, load it up. - Yeah! How much you figure we got? - Plenty. Ladies, out. Hey, where's Mondo? (speaking foreign language) Speak English, will ya? - You got it back there. - That's better. Here, load this. You know, you're going to go along with us. It's been a long, long time for me. - Leave her alone. (both screaming) - Leave her alone, leave her alone. (gasping) (coughing) Teach her a lesson. Yeah. You're going to go along with us. (woman gasping) - You pig, you pig, you pig. (gun firing) - You killer her. - No shit. (gun firing) Yeah, sure is a fine day. (man coughing) Hey Jamie, finish him. (gun firing) - [Man] This'll make sure (gun firing) (sobbing) (man laughing) - Put her on my horse. Unhitch the horses. No reason why they're going to wind up being buzzards bait too. (dramatic orchestral music) - Hey, boss man. We've had it. Let's find a place to camp, huh? - You're right. Go on ahead and see if he can find something. - All right, come on. (dramatic orchestral music) (man groaning) (all laughing) - [Pudge] What you looking at, Andrews? - The woman. - Don't get any fancy ideas. She's mine. - How about we cut cards? High man gets first. Next high is second. (gun firing) (dramatic orchestral music) (man laughing) - Now I told you, she's mine. What you do after I'm through is your business. I don't care. If you want to cut cards, cut cards. - Yeah, Pudge is right. Besides he's been in jail some time, eh? Want some peyote? - Hell, it was his idea. He oughta have first. I don't mind seconds. Give me them cards, Andrews. Give 'em to me. (belching) (dramatic orchestral music) King, I got a king. - [Man] Let me have a card. Lordy lordy won't she look fine. Come on, Andrews, pick a card. (all laughing) - Please. Please (dramatic orchestral music) - Hey, let's go someplace private. These mules, they've got no manners. (dramatic orchestral music) Whoa there. (grunting) (both grunting) (Pudge shouting) (all shouting) (laughing) Hold her, hold her. Strip her, stake her out, Indian style. I'll show you, you goddamn fox. (man laughing) (suspenseful music) (eerie ambient music) (all laughing) (all singing indistinctly) (all laughing) - Hey, Pudge. - Hey. (all laughing) - You know we got us a Virgin? (man vocalizing) - You mean we had us a virgin. - Yeah. - Did you kill her? - I broke her in, that's all. She's all yours, boys. (all shouting) - Hey, that's my woman. Hold it. (grunting) (shouting) (eerie ambient music) (dramatic orchestral music) - Figure they'll be looking for a gang, so we'll stand a better chance if we split up. - We just got back together. - And we'll be together permanent if they ever catch up with us. - What makes you so sure there's gonna be a posse after us? - [Man] Shit, man. Does the sun come up in the mornings? - First of all, are going to be looking for me, the gold, and somebody just might've been waiting for her. And when they find no sign of her at the stage, they'll come tracking. - Yes, I think we found it. Come on. - And we'll all meet in El Paso in about three months. I figure by that time, this will all be forgotten. - Whatever you say, Pudge. Why can't I go with you? - Because we draw less attention if we go alone. Besides there's a cattle drive going from Phoenix down to the railhead at Wilcox and I aim to be with it. - Cattle drive? The sun got you or something? That's work, boss man. - Yeah. It's $8000 in your kick. Why do you want to work so hard? That's crazy. - It's smart crazy. Who's going to be looking for a gold-heavy stud sweating it out on the trail. Why don't you use your head once in a while, Heidi? - True, true. Tip my hat to you, Pudge. - Me, I go to Stein. Good woman and drink there. - They're better in Tucson. If Karl shows up in Tucson, they'll stretch your neck. Ain't that right? - Yeah. Stein is much better for me. Then maybe go to Red Rock, gamble with mine there. - Well, I'm heading in around Tucson. Find me a job. Maybe... (sneezing) Maybe ranch hand. What about you, Cat? - Silver City. - Why you going there? I don't know. I never been there. That's all. - I'll ride as far as Lordsburg with you. - [Cat] What's there? - Nothing. I ain't never been there, that's all. (all laughing) (birds chirping) - God almighty. Mayor Perkins' wife. God almighty. - Jesus, Allan, they must be crazy. They blew all the wagons apart with a shotgun. - Henry didn't have a chance. Bastards. Well, Zane, get some blankets here to wrap them and get them back to town. - Where's the school teacher. Don't see no sign of her. - You reckon she didn't take the stage. - She took it, all right. Marsha telegraphed they were gonna meet him with his prisoner, Pudge Elliott. He added that the teacher was right pretty. Now that woman's purse. - [Man] That must be the schoolteacher's. - Track's heading northeast. There was a bunch of 'em. One of 'em was real deep. Must've been carrying heavy. - [Man] They took her with them. God almighty. (dramatic orchestral music) - What about her? - What about her? - Go back and cut her loose? - What for? - I don't know. I thought- - Let's ride. (suspenseful orchestral music) (suspenseful orchestral music) (Alice moaning) (water rushing) (light orchestral music) (moaning) (gasping) (light orchestral music) (light orchestral music) - We've been gone for some time. Make camp here and strike out at first light. Got a good head start, but we'll find 'em. - Allan! - What? - Allan! Pieces of a woman's dress. Stakes. - Stripped her down. Stripped her down and tied her up. Sons of bitches. Look at this. - Moccasin, Apache. - Jesus. You figure there was Indians? - They're white men. Their horses were shot. - Here's one that ain't. An Indian pony. What do you think, Sheriff? - I don't know. Have a careful look around and see what we can come up with before dark. God willing she's still alive. - If the Apaches got her, she's better off dead. - Look at this! Take a look! You think she fared any better with white men? Jesus, look at it! Look at this. - Woman, white woman. (guns firing) - [Woman] How many of are there? Can you see? - [Man] No, just shoot at anything that moves. They're Indians, all right, though. I can smell 'em. (suspenseful orchestral music) - [Woman] Did you get him? - [Man] Well, he lit out like a rabbit with his ass a-fire. - [Woman] He was yelling something. - [Man] I might've hit him, but he's probably drunk, stray. - [Woman] He asked something. I could just about make it out, out there. - [Man] Pay it no mind, woman. Whatever it be, it'll keep till morning. We'll have a look see then. You go bed down. I'll sit and watch a while. (suspenseful orchestral music) (birds chirping) (suspenseful orchestral music) - There's signs they split. Figure we'll do the same. Or we won't. Ride 'em down one at a time. Let's get at it. (light orchestral music) (horse neighing) (light orchestral music) Dry. Droppings are dry, but they came this way. (horse neighing) (blowing) (Alice moaning) (light orchestral music) - Thank you. It's alive. (grunting) (laughing) - Sheriff, the boys have been talking. We've been out three days now. We gotta be getting back. - Yeah, Allan, we all got families and jobs and such. - We'll find them. - Allan, we've got no supplies. We go back to town and stock up. I'll ride out with you again. - Yeah, you're right, just. Let's pack it in, boys, let's go home. (light acoustic guitar music) - Yeah. Alice. Alice. - Alice. - Alice. - Alice. - Alice. - Alice. Alice. - Yes. - Alice. - And you? - Chatto. Chatto. - Chatto. Chatto, that's very beautiful. Sounds almost Spanish. I know. Chatto Flatnose. Chatto Flatnose. - Chatto. (laughing) - Got one in Lordsburg loaded down with gold. Going after him. - Sheriff, that's New Mexico territory. You got no authority there. - This is the only authority I need to go after that bunch. Men, I swore I'd go after them animals. I aim to do just that. - I don't know, Allan. Lordburg's a far piece. - I know. I need help and I'd take it as right friendly if you'd ride with me. (light orchestral music) - You're perfect. You know that? Oh, look at him. Is he for me? Is he? He's just like yours. - Lee, Lee, horse. - Lee. Lee. - [Chatto] Alice. - What's in there? (Chatto speaking foreign language) Why do you want to send me away, Chatto? Why? Why, Chatto? I don't want to go. Don't make me go, Chatto, don't make me go. Chatto, please. Please try to understand. I don't have any place to go. I got... I wanna stay with you. I need you, Chatto. Chatto, I need you to help me find them. I need you.

Hoping what you hold in your hand's how you play the hand that you hold. - Agreed. (laughing) - I don't need no learning when it comes to cards, asshole. I make my bet and I'm waiting.

I don't, (gasping) (eerie ambient music) (gun firing) (eerie vocalizing) Peyote. - [Allan] Where the hell did that come from? - [Man] Over there. Let's go. (dramatic orchestral music) - Well, we lost 'em. I can't figure it out. - Who in the hell were they? - Apaches. - What do Apaches have to do with that fella? - They killed him to keep him quiet. - That's for sure. - Quiet about what? - About the killings and the stage robbery and all. - But they was white men. The track showed that they were. - That's right, damn it. We found Indian sights at their camp, didn't we? - Sure is clear. - What do we do now, Allan? - We'll rest a while and go back and bury that felon. (coyote howling) (dramatic orchestral music) (gun cocking) (suspenseful orchestral music) (eerie ambient music) (gun firing) (man groaning) (both shouting) (grunting) - Come on, Jesse.

(suspenseful orchestral music) (eerie ambient music) (gun firing) (vocalizing) (gun firing) (gasping) - Indians, Indians! (screaming) (guns firing) - All right, hold it. You fellas having to take your chance. Throw down your guns, you'll get a fair trial. I'll give you my word on that. - Martin? Fair trial? What kind shit is that? We're the law. You're all under arrest. - Arrest? What in the hell? What did you say? - We're the law. We're the law. You're all under arrest. - What? - Tucson Citizen's Posse. Sheriff Martin Lord. - [Allan] What did you say? - Sheriff Martin Lord! Tucson! - Well, I'm a son of a bitch. All right, hold it. Take it easy, fellas. Sheriff Allan Pierce, Phoenix. - God damn. Put up your weapons, men. We've been shooting at the law. God damn. - Feel like a damn fool. - Likewise. - Anybody hurt? - Ed? Everybody all right? - Matt Hallory got one in the leg and Jimmy Tyler took some rock chips in the eyes, but he'll be okay. - Oh. How do we look? - Don't know. - Well, goddammit, check! - Yes, sir. - We're a little jumpy. Thought you might've been that bunch that killed that fella in town last night. - No, we've been out tracking after a couple of Apaches. Murdered a prisoner of mine about five days ago, and we've been running down signs ever since. Prisoner we had was one of 'em in on the killing all right. About the time he started to talk, they cut him down. - [Martin] What's that got to do with Indians? - [Allan] Apaches shot him. - [Ed] Sheriff, some said in town them that did the killing was dressed like Indians. - Oh, so they did. Hey, Jess. - I'll tell you what, Ed. You ride back to town and send a telegram to Fort Grant and Fort Boyd. - Jess! - Tell 'em we got Indian trouble and could use some troopers. - Jess, get those horses together. - Take Matt with you. - We gotta get outta here. - Now if I could find my horse. We oughta ride together seein' as how we're looking for the same quarry. - Huh? All right. (light orchestral music) - [Man] Ha ha! (man shouting) (cows mooing) (suspenseful orchestral music) (gun cocking) (suspenseful orchestral music) - Charlie Bogs here sporting a goose-egg big as your fist. He was on guard last night and they just up and hit him. Tracks show they was Indians. - Sure bum puzzles me. I'm lucky though. They could have killed me. Apaches usually do. - Yeah, but Apaches'll raid. They'll steal bead or two. Just for food. - [Man] Why the hell would he wanna take that fella for? - You say he signed on in Phoenix, huh? - Yeah. He's a quiet fella, kept to himself. Damn good worker though. - That's all his gear right here. - God, must be thousands here. - More than likely his cut of the shipment. Well, he's one of 'em, all right. There's one of 'em, boys. Let's get movin'. (suspenseful orchestral music) (horse neighing) (dramatic orchestral music) (suspenseful orchestral music) (suspenseful orchestral music) (Pudge gasping) (eerie ambient music) - Who, who are you?
