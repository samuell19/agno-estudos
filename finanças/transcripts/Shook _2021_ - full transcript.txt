Granted, you said no, you wouldn't watch Chico like 10 times, and then that chick died and you realized it could make you look better or whatever. I don't know, but I'm glad you're there, really. Um... feel free to help with the packing. The realtor is coming to take pictures next week. And second, I know I've been kind of hard lately. Diana, turn on the lights in mom's room. Um, I just think when I was taking care of mom and all of her medications, all these different ones had to be different times on a schedule, and it just... Not that I'm trying to make you feel bad or anything. Really, I totally signed up to take care of her, and I was happy to. I really was. And, um, you're not off the hook. It'll be your turn to take care of me soon. So there's that. Um... Love you. Chico, come here, buddy. Chico, come here, buddy. There you are. Hi! Hi, Chico. Diana, play Chill Vibes play list. And turn on the A.C. Ew. Are you guys there? Are you guys there?! I think they're there. Happy. Welcome. It's ancient game, it's called Quarters. I haven't actually played it before. Ready? Ah.Ah, that's okay. That's not how you play. It ishow you play.Nuh-unh. Do better, come on. Do better. Do better. Do better. Oh, that was so close! Mia, we miss you. We miss you. We wish you were here. I miss you, Mia. Oh, my God. Where are you right now? We're touching knees. Love you, Mia. I'm just saying, when the cat's away, the Santi will play. Oh, my goodness. He wouldn't do that. I quit. No, don't. What the hell? Diana, lock all the doors. And turn on the lights in the living room. You see this? She's on my phone. He has crazy bitches on his phone. If you could see his battery right now. It is so bad. Oh, my gosh. Should I turn the phone around? Shall I turn the phone around? Shall I? Shall I show our wonderful audience? Leave me alone! Oh, my goodness! I think I have to. Oh, my gosh. What about this one? That's crazy. Oh, no, I can't. Shut up! Leave me alone. Oh, my goodness. You called me a lot of shit right now. He is crazy. This is so crazy. No, no, no. Ow! You tickle me. Come on. That was then. This is now. Bullshit. Chico loves car rides. Chico, come here, buddy. Chico? Diana, turn on the lights in the foyer. Chico? Chico, come here, buddy. Chico? Hey, babes. It's Jade. Leave a message. Chico? Diana, turn on the lights in the kitchen. Chico? Chico? Diana, turn on the lights in Mia's room. Hey, babes. It's Jade. Leave a message. Chico? Got your food. Hello? Mia? Who is this? Oh, sorry. This is Kellan. I live across the street. How did you get my number? Your sister gave it to me. For emergencies, you know? Did you just leave me a voicemail? Yeah. Sorry. I wanted to know if you'd seen my dog, Rascal. I can't find him. No. Sorry. Shit. I mean, uh, shoot. Okay. Well, I'm going to go. You haven't been around in a while. Huh? You haven't been around. I haven't seen you. Oh. Yeah. You know, I don't live here anymore. I'm going to school. I mean, I get it. I know things were pretty bad with your mom. No, I've just, you know, been busy. Last time I saw her, she thought I was your uncle and told me to vote for Jimmy Carter. Oh, well, you know, at least she's not a pedophile, so... I just meant you used to come around more, with your friends. Yeah. Like I said, I've been busy. How's Jade? What? I can't believe she got that tattoo. What are you talking about? You know they call it a tramp stamp, right? How do you know about Jade's tattoo? We're friends now. What? Online. That girl takes more selfies than even you. You know, I... I really should go. Oh, okay. Yeah. Sorry. Let me know if you see Rascal. Sure. Sure thing. Chico? Chico? Hello? Hey, Mia. It's Kellan again. Yeah. What do you want? I just heard you calling for Chico a bit ago. Is he lost, too? I don't know. Get your ass over here. Probably hiding under the bed. What did you just say? Nicole says he hides under the bed when he's scared. I didn't realize you and my sister talked so much. Oh, you know, just in passing. He's a cute dog. Okay. Well, thanks for the tip. Yeah. I'd hate to see anything bad happen to Chico. Aren't you worried about Rascal? Yes, absolutely. Then why aren't you out looking for him? I did. I just, uh, couldn't find him. I don't think he's in Nicole's room. Why not? The door is closed. Oh, Lani is such a slut. What? Is he there under the bed? No. What did you just say before that? Uh, hold on a sec. Diana, turn on the lights in Nicole's room. Diana, turn on the lights. Diana, turn on the lights. Chico! Here, buddy! What was that? What? I heard a dog. You said yours was missing. Oh, I just found him, a few seconds ago. Why did you tell me to look under Nicole's bed? I told you. Stop lying. What's going on? What's going on is... I've got your fucking dog, bitch.

Oh! Oh! Is everything all right? I made a mistake. I'm sorry. Diana, turn on the lights in the living room. Jade. Oh, my God. Are you okay? Jade, are you there? He says if you leave, scream for the neighbors. if you call anyone... Jade... he'll kill me. The time has come for us to establish some ground rules. Rule number one, when I call, you answer. Jade covered the rest. No leaving, no screaming to get attention from neighbors, no speaking to anyone other than me. If you do, then... I kill everyone. Chico! Oh, don't do that. It's just taunting the poor fella. Why are you doing this? What were you supposed to do tonight? What do you mean? What was the one thing your sister asked you to do? Take care of the dog. It's an important thing, you know, to be a caretaker. What are you talking about? I'm saying you were supposed to take care of a dog, and look what's happened. I tried. You tried? You mean by spending all of your time texting your worthless friends? No, he was with me on the couch. For how long? I don't know. He was there. You don't even know. Terrible. I'm sorry! That's not good enough, Mia. What are you doing to him? It's not me, Mia. It's you. Why are you doing this? You'll see. But first, I need you to make a choice. Mia! He says you have to choose! You have to choose between Lani and Chico! Mia! Wait! Don't hurt her. This is crazy. Can't argue with that. Why are you doing this? I promise to tell you. Pinky promise. But right now, you have to make a choice. Who do you care about more? Chico or Lani? Are you kidding? It's a simple question. Your sick sister's dog or the girl trying to sleep with your boyfriend? You don't have to do this. You don't have to hurt anyone. Time's up. Wait! Mia, he says you're out of time. You're out of time! You have to pick! He's got a knife! Lani! I pick Lani. Hello? Are you there? I pick Lani. All right, back inside. The sooner you go inside, the sooner this will all be over. Oh, I see. You're scared. It looks like you need some extra encouragement. No! That's not possible! She's on a plane right now. No, I don't think so. How are you doing this? Round two. Come inside, Mia. I think you know what will happen if you don't. So, here we go. You ready? I guess. You don't sound like your usual buoyant self, Mia. Anything wrong? Fuck you! What the fuck is the matter with you?! And she's back. Okay, much better. What if I just hang up? What if I just stop talking to you? That's not an option. But how about this? I'll meet you halfway. "Yes, Kellan. Tell me more." Okay, well, since you asked, we both know you have another big choice coming up, but what if there was a way for you to not have to make that choice? Might that be appealing to you? Yes. That's what I thought. So? So, all you have to do is answer three questions. That's it. If you get them right, then I'll stop this whole thing and let everyone go. But if you get one wrong, then you have to make a choice between Nicole... and Santi. Okay. Here we go. First question. When administering CPR, maintaining proper rhythm is crucial. What song is recommended for achieving the correct tempo. Huh? You have one minute. No, wait, what? Can you repeat that? 57, 56, 55. Damn it. Mia! Help! Help me, Mia! Mia, babe. CPR might come in handy. Asshole! I don't know. I don't know. I don't see a song! Here you are cheating and complaining about it. Tsk-tsk. Didn't say... You didn't say I couldn't. 16, 15, 14... 10 Mississippi, 9 Mississippi. "Staying Alive", "Staying Alive", by the Bee Gees. Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding! Get that girl a toaster! Next question. And this time, no cheating. Wait. What is... Wait! Yes? Is Santi okay? For now. Next question. At what temperature is someone considered to have a fever? No. No interwebs. 59, 58, 57... Aaah! No! ...42, 41, 40... ...28, 27, 26... ...5, 4... 100.4. ...3... 100.4. Hello? Was I right? Yes, that is correct. Is Jade okay? So far. Okay, what's next? Oh, now you're into it now that you're winning. Come on, let's finish this. Okay. Final question. What were your mother's last words? How would you know what my mother's last words were? 59, 58, 57... ...42, 41, 40... Why are you asking about my mother? Why not? What does she have to do with this? I liked your mom. I don't remember her ever speaking about you. Well, she didn't speak of you much either. Go to hell. She probably forgot you even existed. I mean, how often did you come by to visit when she was getting sick? I mean, when she was really sick. Fuck you! And I don't mean how often you promised to visit because that's not obviously a much different answer. Who told you what my mother's last words were? How do you know I wasn't there? You weren't.How do you know? Nicole would have told me. Did she tell you what your mother's last words were? No? Why weren't you there, Mia? I had school. Didn't Nicole tell you that she had only a few hours left? Yes, but... 14, 13, 12... You're running out of time. This isn't fair! ...6, 5... No! ...2... Please, please, don't hurt her! One. Don't hurt who? Lani or Nicole? That's right. Looks like we went through all of that, and we're right back where we started. Time to make a choice. This isn't fair. You don't know the answer. I do know the answer. And you do, too. What do you mean? Your mom had a breathing tube for the last two weeks of her life. She couldn't say anything. I... You forgot. Well, that's behind us now. We have more pressing matters to deal with. I can't do this. Sure you can. In fact, you've done it once before. But that was a dog! A beloved dog. Just leave us alone. Who's it going to be, Mia? You've got one minute. 59, 58... ...57, 56... ...55. 54... This is crazy! Fuck you! You know what happens if you don't choose, right? They both die. I can't choose. I can't. You must want something. There must be a reason why you're doing all of this. You must want something. 22 Mississippi, 21 Mississippi... What do you want?...20 Mississippi. Tell me what it is! ...15 Mississippi...Stop! ...14 Mississippi, 13 Mississippi. Just stop this! 5 Mississippi, 4 Mississippi... Stop! 3 Mississippi. I don't know! Nicole's sick! Lani! I pick Lani! Dude, you just killed your sister. What? I love you too, bitch. I don't understand. I know. Fucking cut it out, Lani! Tell me what's happening! It's okay. It's okay. Everyone's okay. How? It was all fake. Well, here we are just fucking with you. I am in your attic right now. Lani, where's Nicole? Oh, um, probably in San Francisco by now. I don't know. I don't understand. Okay, so the videos were from after your mom's funeral. You know, back at the house. What? Okay, so I wasn't sure if it was going to work. I was going to ask Nicole to help us out, but then Jade and Santi was like, "No, there's no way she'd do this." And well, you know, she hates us. So I thought I'd improvise. What about Kellan? What about him? I don't know, he's probably jacking off over there. Ew.He was on the phone. No, it wasn't him. It was a voice changer app and a fake phone number. Oh, wait. Wait, wait, wait. Hold on. Hey, babe. Hey. Where are you? We're in the house next door, the one that's for sale. We've been going back and forth all night. - How? - The balconies are so close together in the 'burbs, so we can just jump from the balcony of the master bedroom over there to the one over here. We recorded all the live video last night. Did you know there's an app that lets you upload pre-recorded stuff? Why are you doing this? You know, you have a lot of followers. So? So we've live-streamed everything. Okay, well, not everything, but most of it. And you two just went along with it? Okay, let me explain. I'm sorry. Awesome. I thought it would be fun. Fun? What the fuck is wrong with you guys?! Fucking followers?! Ugh! Fucking assholes! Ohh! Shh, shh, shh. She has no idea what's going on right now. This is amazing. And we're bringing her flowers. How cute. Look what I've got. I pinched them from her room. Shh! This is so much fun. Shh. Okay, guys, this stuff is the shit. It is so good. And it tastes amazing. But it's really gory. Oooh. No, I'm going to drink it. Aah! Please leave a message. Thanks. Barrington Hotel. Hi. I was wondering if you could connect me with someone staying there... uh, Nicole Larson. One moment. Thank you. Hello? Hi! It's me! Mia. Everything okay? Um, did you make it to San Fran okay? Yes. Good. Um... are you sure everything's okay? I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. For what? I'm sorry I haven't been here. Oh. Yeah, I just wanted to call and... tell you that I was sorry. Do you mean that? Yeah. I wish I could believe you. I know I've apologized before. You have. And nothing's changed. Exactly. But... this is different. How's Chico? He's fine. Really? Yeah. What's he doing? He's sleeping. Where? Uh, with me, on the couch. Send me a picture? Yeah, sure, as soon as we hang up. Thanks. It'll help me fall asleep. Oh, um, N-Nicole, your phone is off, by the way. Nicole? I was getting a lot of texts, so I put it on silent. Oh, from who? From the camera in Mom's room. Now, is it just Jade, Santi, and Lani, or are there more people? It's not what you think. I got to get to sleep. I have to be at the hospital early tomorrow. Yeah. Okay. Lani, where is Chico?! Where's the dog? Mia. Mia, get out the house. Just cut it out already! Stop it! Mia, you have to leave. Stop it! Just stop it! Get out of here. Where's the dog? Where's Chico? Get out. Or I swear to God... Listen to me. I mean it. Assholes! Where's the dog? Mia, wait. No, fuck you. Mia, just listen. No, youlisten. It wasn't my idea, I swear, but... Do you want me to start counting down, you sadistic fuck? But... What is wrong with you guys? You don't understand! No, you're right. I don't understand. I don't know what the hell happened here tonight, but I know that I hate you. I know that. I mean, that shit about my mom? What did I ever do to you? It was Lani. It was all Lani. You guys are supposed to be my friends. Why don't any of you come down here yet? You know that I can hear you walking around up there. The game is over. It's not, Mia. We had to do what they said or they were going to hurt you. Oh, give me a break. They told me to go into your room and wait, and then it was locked. You know what? Just give me my keys back and I'll leave. I don't have your keys! You aren't listening! I'm getting out of here! Oh, fucking suburbs. It's not funny anymore! Okay, enough. It's not funny anymore, Lani! Aaaaaaaaaaaah! What? What the fuck?! I'm ready. Put down the knife. Put it down. Go into the living room. What's in them? I'm in your bedroom right now. But I can hear someone. They're coming. Aah. Mm. Aaah! Ahhhh! Aaaaah! No. Santi! Santi! Santi! Santi! Aaaaah! Aaah! No! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! I don't understand! I don't understand! Jade? Mia, is he okay? No, he's not. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. Where are you? Jade, where are you? I'm so sorry. I'm so, so sorry. Shut up. Just... try and stay calm. It's just it was a lot of money. That's why you did this? Lani paid you? It was just... so much money. And Santi and I thought, well, we'd split it with you after. This was about money?! We were going to split it with you! Did you just get that? Yes. Excuse me. Could you help me find the ice cream? Ice cream? Uh, you turn right, right again. Aisle 7. Okay, thank you. Sure. What do you want me to say? Okay. Okay. I'm... broke. I pretend that I have a lot of money, but I don't. What? Yeah, okay. I work at Whole Foods. I lied. I just... I say that shit online because no one would be interested in following a cashier. Okay? But Mia... she had the money, we thought. Uhh. Aaaaaah! Mom? God. I guess you found Mom. I know you're in my closet. I get texts that there's movement, remember? Hello. What did you do? I feel so much better now that you know. We buried Mom! Well, no. Obviously, we didn't. How? People will do anything for money. Do you really want to know the details? Oh, fuck. N-No. You were in San Francisco. I called you. You called San Francisco. The hotel patched you through to my cell. What? I found the front-desk clerk on Venmo last week and, uh, made him an offer he couldn't refuse. Sensing a theme? What about Kellan? I don't know. He probably is jacking off over there. Jesus, Nicki! Oh, my God! I had to. I don't understand! She wasn't her anymore. She was becoming less her every day. But Nicole! And now... Now she's still her. I know. I know it's crazy. If you know it's crazy, then why are you doing any of this? Why?! How can you pick Lani over me? Nicole. I'm your sister, Mia. Yes, but... you're sick. Nicole, i... I-I didn't... I didn't plan on this part. I only planned the first part, the fake part. But then... then, after all of this, you still went ahead and you lied to me about Chico. You still... couldn't tell me the truth. Still covering up for your friends. I just couldn't take it. This is just Livingston's. This isn't you. Most of the time it isn't. But sometimes... it is. Nicole, where's Jade? Oh. Ready to play again already? Sheesh. I would have thought you'd want a break. No, stop! I don't know if you've noticed, but there's been a bit of a theme to all of this tonight. I've noticed. You could have been the one to take care of Mom. I know. You could have been the sick one. I know. I have to have injections every day. I have the personality changes, the mood swings, fever, trouble breathing, walking! You know, it's funny, but that's the one that really pisses me off... walking. It's such a simple thing. I saw you earlier. You walked fine. Yes, earlier. Now, not so much. Tomorrow, fine. Next week, not at all! So, here's the thing. I'll give you five minutes on this one because it's a doozy. Break your leg in five minutes or Jade dies. What?! I don't care how you do it, but you have to do it in five minutes. Stop, Nicole! Sorry. Can't. How do I know you aren't just going to kill her anyway? I promise you, Mia. I give you my word. If you do this... I'll stop. How can I believe you?! Because I'm your sister. I know when Mom was sick, we agreed I'd be the one to take care of her. I know that. But once you moved out... you were gone. It's like we didn't even matter to you anymore. That's not true. You know, sometimes it feels like... It's... It's like these... sharp, shooting pains, like, all over my body. Like... Like little knives. No! Oh, my God! 4 minutes, 59 seconds. 58... 57... Aah! 56. That might work. Going to take some commitment on your part, though, and let's admit it... you haven't always been the best at following through. How are you going to know if it's broken? What if it's a hairline fracture? If I can't tell, then it's not broken enough. Fuck. Whoa. You only got three minutes left. Better get cracking. Who was that? No one! If you call the police or let anyone know what's going on, I'll kill Jade now. I didn't! I swear! Why is there a car outside? I don't know why he's here. It's not me. You're running out of time! Aaaaaah! Ohh! I can't tell! Then it's not enough. Fuck. Okay. Ohh. Go away! 30 seconds! Aaaaaaaah! Ohh. I did it! I said, "Legs," not "Leg." Ugh! Aaaah! Well, that was quite a jump, but it still looks like you only got one. Ohh! Ohhhhhhhh! You went for both, though. I applaud the effort. You really love your friends. Is she okay?! Is she okay, Nicki? I can't believe you broke your leg for Jade. I guess part of you really is a good person. Please tell me she's okay. Jade? Yeah. No. I got to say... ...you surprised me. I did not think you could be this selfless. Nicki, no. If only you would have done it for me. So, you paid them? Are they pieces of shit or what? Nicole. Put Mom's pension to good use, at least. Nicole! Do you know how many dogs I killed to set this thing up? What? It was way worse than Lani. She slept with Santi last night, by the way, after we were finished recording everything. That's not true. How do you know? Santi was a virgin. Super Catholic, so... I don't know. I doubt it. People are so different online. Lani's rich. Santi's a player. You're sweet as an angel. That's your brand, right? I guess. "Makeup by Mia." I don't know why you couldn't use your real name. Mia ismy real name. Middle name. It sounded nicer. I really... I really thought you were going to pick me in the end. But you didn't. And if you didn't pick me now, you're not going to pick me later... not when I can't walk or feed myself or go to the bathroom by myself. I promised I would take care of you. Yeah, you did. You promised. But that's just words. It's not real... just like so much of tonight wasn't real. Nothing about you is real. It's all just carefully curated for online consumption. I'm not like that. You can't handle me or... or sickness or complicated feelings, so you just bail and live in your fantasy world, putting on makeup for your legions of fans. But I did it! I did all of your tests! But for them. Well, I guess this is it. What are you talking about? We might as well check out, too. I've got a gun. I can do you, do me, and then we're done. Where did you get a gun? Mom had it. I guess she didn't think my baseball bat was gonna cut it if we were overtaken by suburban rapists. I can vouch for the bat. You sure can. Chico? I-I left him outside and his crate. If you move or do anything, I'll kill them. Hey, Nicole. Sorry to bother you. I found Chico wandering around in my yard. Oh, my gosh. He must have snuck outside. Thank you so, so much. Yeah. You got to be careful with that, uh, maniac running around killing dogs. You're right. Thank you so much. Yeah, no problem. Uh... Oh. Oh! Oh! That wasn't what it looked like. Wha... What was it, then? I'm painting, and I spilled it everywhere. And now I have to give Chico a bath. I hate when that happens. Red, huh? I wanted something with a little drama. That'll do it. Okeydokey. Well, thanks again for bringing Chico back. Sure. Uh, how's your sister doing? What? Mia. I saw her come by earlier. Yeah. I just wanted her to watch the dog while I was out. It doesn't seem like she did a very good job. Yeah. Well, that's Mia. Anyway, I should go. C... Could I talk to her for a second? What? I just... I mean, I've never, uh... I've never actually met her. She went home. No, she didn't. Why do you say that? Her car's still here. She got a ride. She wasn't feeling well. Oh. Hmm. That's too bad. Yeah. Phew. Um... Ah, for fuck's sake. Diana, turn the lights on. Mia. Mia?! Not funny, Mia. Who says this is Mia? Mm. You found the voice-changer app. It's a little steep, for $5.99, but, hey, I think you'll like it. Glad you think this is funny. This is stupid. Your leg is broken. You're not getting away. We'll see. Hmm. Hi, guys.
