Subtitles by explosiveskull Blue... Blue... Blue... This guy wasted 19 people tonight. I was almost number 20, but then I don't know, he just stopped. Catatonics often swing from an excited state - to complete stupor. - No, no it wasn't like that. He knew what he was doing. I find that difficult to believe. The man is literally unable to communicate, he has shut down. Can't you just jump-start him? "Jump-start" him? People are not cars, Lieutenant. It's still not exactly clear what's happening at the Embassy tonight, but it appears to be some sort of terrorist activity. The entire SWAT Team... In positions. - Lieutenant, we're holding. - What do you got? Someone broke in, locked down the Emir's party. That's all we know. We haven't been able to speak to anybody inside. - I've deployed my men. - What are you waiting for? I have specific instructions to wait for Commissioner Marino. - Where the hell is he? - Some party uptown. - I'm going in. - Lieutenant, you can't! Hold your fire, the Lieutenant's going in. Sorry, sir, I couldn't stop him! He heard a scream and barged in alone! Who? Don't tell me... Hound Dog! Yes sir, Lieutenant Margolies. Well, what are you waiting for? Move! Team! Who's there? No. Don't move! Don't move! The hand. There he is! Go get him! No! No! Hold your fire! - Move out of the line of fire! - He's not a threat anymore! - Move! God damn it! - Back off! You're not in charge! No! lam. Margolies... who the hell do you think you are? I gave you strict orders to stay in place until I got here. - I thought I could save some lives. - Well, you thought wrong! Son of a bitch. Clear! Clear! Jesus, the Chinese Consulate. No survivors. Wait a minute, what about the woman? What woman? Out in the hallway. There was an Arab woman. Corporal, what's the status? - All clear. No survivors. - Look again. Well, thanks to you this guy will get off with insanity. You should have wasted him. Look, Dr. Yamamoto! Yamato! Whatever, just... just get him in shape enough to answer some questions. That's all... Oh, Jesus, I'm sorry. Here, let me help you. No thanks, I can do it myself. I guess I get a little clumsy around beautiful women... uh, doctors. Dr. DeCamp is our specialist at "jump-starting" patients, though we try not to question her methods. Really? Let me guess, you play some funky music, get 'em to let their hair down and boogie. That's a crude description, but, yeah. It's similar to "cognitive therapy." I use music to unlock doors in my patients' minds. Yes, yes. "Psychiatry is more of an art than a science." If you'll excuse me. Oh, wait a minute! You don't want lose this one. It's classic Rock & Roll, that would heal me. I'm Lieutenant Margolies. That's my case in there. Jade DeCamp. I'm the resident psychiatrist here. That's my patient. I could use your help. I don't think he did it alone. In fact, if you do come across anything, my cell number's on there. Not my department. He may be a criminal to you, but to me he's a patient. Hey... I'm just trying to get to the bottom of this, find out what the truth is. I've got to go, Lieutenant. That's "Dan." Hey, after your session, maybe we could go get a cup of coffee? Sorry. I mean, I've got work to do. I'm not going to hurt you. I'm here to help you. I just want you to be more comfortable. Now, I want you to relax. Listen to the music. Empty your mind. Don't think of anything. Just feel the music. Somebody's messed with this sick bastard's mind. Conspiracy, huh? You couldn't find the woman. How did she get out of the Embassy without help? There was no one else in there. - I saw the... - No woman. Nobody. So what about this thing called "The Hand"? - What about that? - There's no such thing. No woman. No band of conspirators. This guy's a loner, a deranged animal. That's it, huh? That's all there is to it? There's no grand design here, just a little outbreak of chaos. Like a pimple on the face of God. Besides, this isn't your case anymore, Dan. The Feds are taking it over. So hands off. Okay? Was it wonderful? It was... exciting, but... But? He's still alive. He didn't go all the way... Still alive? There was one last one, a cop. He had him down, he had the blades right at the man's throat. Then he looked up right at me and stopped. He broke. It wasn't like that. It was a choice. Impossible. He gave me a message. He said, "No." Where is he now? He's in good hands, I assure you. Dr. DeCamp, we will be suspending treatment for the time being. I know you think my therapy's no better than bloodletting or leeches, but I believe I can get through to him. I'll say this just once, Doctor. Not this one. He won't be staying with us. What time is the pick up on John Doe? I haven't got a transfer. I'm gonna grab a coffee. In other news around the city, the Mayor has cancelled all leave and vacation time for the police force in order to quell the increasing random violence reported in the city's streets. A City Hall spokesperson has denied reports that the National Guard is on standby alert... Hello, again. I want to talk to you. I did my training at the University of Chicago. That's when I started working in "music therapy." They say music is the key to the soul. Look, they're going to take you away from here, tonight. This is probably the last time we'll talk. And... Please, I want to know who you are... We haven't much time. You recognize this one? Ahh! Please, God, no... No more music. No more, I promise. - What do you remember? - My name is John Jaspers. God, I remember everything. Blue, I have a question for you. Have you ever believed in anything? I mean really believed? I used to think I believed in art, but you know what? It's all form. No substance. Sometimes, I can see the painting on the blank canvas even before I paint it. Sometimes, I can feel it in my body. Does that sound crazy? Yeah. - Look what I have for you. - I'm not hungry. Oh, oh, I don't care. You have to eat. - Not now. - Yes, now. Good boy. I think I could believe in you. Of course. No, no... don't. What the... Don't! No! Did you forget who smuggled you into this country? And who you didn't pay? Ugh! Stop that. You owe me some service. Stop! You touch her again and I'll kill you! I swear to God I will. Kill me? Interesting idea. Go ahead, kill me. Don't! What do you think? Medium rare? When Blue died, everything ended for me. In spite of all our science and technology, I always knew, deep inside, that evil existed, the darkness that possesses us when we cease to believe. Hey, cowboy, feeling bad? It's along way down. You won't even feel it. A moment of terror, suspended in eternity and it's all over. I don't care. People commit suicide because they do care. Suicide? Life, death; happy, sad; pleasure, pain... it's all the same. Don't you believe there's a reason for everything that happens? No heaven, no hell, good, or evil. God is a joke inside a nightmare. - I believe in nothing. - Then why despair? Why not do whatever the hell you feel like doing? I like him. He lies even to himself. What do you mean? If you don't care, then you won't mind if I touch you? I can help you. Why be like the rest of the suckers? I can offer you a new life where nothing can hurt you. Life everlasting, beyond good and evil, where all that matters are your desires. You can have the power to express what you feel inside. I feel nothing inside. Oh, you feel something. No question about it, you feel something. I feel... - Hate...! - Hate's nice. ...for the one who put you here. I want to tear his fucking heart out. I can give you the power of vengeance. Forever. All I ask in return is your immortal soul. That isn't too much to ask, is it? Of someone who believes in nothing? The power of vengeance. - The power of vengeance? - The rage of angels. Just sign here. Sign? A mere formality. Please indulge me. Just one thing, there will come the time when you do believe in something. I believe in nothing. Yes, but there will come the day when you believe in something, and you will regret this deal you have made tonight. And on that day, that thing too shall be mine. You are the universe, alpha and omega, the beast with 10,000 young. "Do as thou wilt shall be the whole of the law." Now, go forth and mutilate. Where's Baez? You stupid fuck. You want I kill you? What the hell? What's the matter? Don't like my art? Aagh! You think I'm a... I'm a madman, a schizophrenic, whatever. But I have seen the beast and it is me. I think I understand. Understand? You'd have to walk my way. Feel, not analyze. On the other side of the bars, you're just a voyeur! I have been there. Bullshit! You haven't seen my devil! You in your little box. Gone to the very best schools, Miss Lonely Hearts, didn't you? From the suburbs to the university with daddy's money, no real life for you. What do you know about the face of evil? Cure it, cure the world. All the baddies out there, if they would only take the cure, Dr. Repressed Chicky's music cure. She plays me Mozart, fuck all, I'm cured! Play me some Wagner, there's more blood in it! Ironic, isn't it? How weak and frail the human body can be. The rush, the pure adrenaline rush. - I feel... - Powerful? Blood does that. Spill enough of it, you can rule the world. Now your work begins, John. There is much killing to be done. No. No more. Yes, more. And then more again. You have no choice. Did you think you could kill, and go back to being the man you were before? This is your destiny. I can't. Of course you can. It's your addiction now, your craving, your reason for being. You will kill for the pure ecstasy of it. No, not for you. We have a pact, you and I, John. You can't touch me. You will live as the Slayer, between life and death; Sleep will be just a memory; Violence your constant companion; Consumed by vengeance. Now, that it may always be with you... No! ...consume your vengeance. Welcome to our nightmare. What do you want? You... Whore? I could be your whore, if you only have the balls to take from him what you want. Take what? The power from our lord and master. Mmm... He does have a weakness and I know what it is. Together we can vanquish him. What's the matter, baby-poo? Don't you love me? Come play with me. This Claire woman and you were lovers? No. We fucked. What happened at the Embassy? M sent me on an errand. He told me what I had to do. He was right. It was a craving, an addiction I couldn't resist. I was in hell, slaughtering demons. I'd become a tool. A machine... giving the devil his due. I should have died there. But I didn't. I conquered the urge. I stopped. I disobeyed him. Now they'll come for me to finish the job. You'd better get out of here. It's not gonna be pleasant. You don't believe me, do you? I believe that this man, M, has some kind of hold on you. Some psychological power, but he's not the devil. And music will soothe the savage beast? You've got a lot to learn, little girl. We are not animals. We have choices. We are not slaves to destiny. We can change what we do, who we become. You said you stopped. That was an act of will. You can do it again. That's why I'm not giving up on you. Too late. They're coming for me tonight. Only to transfer you to another facility. They know who I am. Hello, Jaspers. How's it hanging? Look at you. I made you the Jack of Swords, but you chose to play The Fool. Covered in dirt. You could be wearing the blood of my enemies. As the dirt fills your lungs with every last breath, you will curse the day you crossed me, and wish you could still wear these for the purpose they were intended, the purpose you turned away from, John. What? Nothing to say to me before I send you off to hell? I'll be waiting there for you. You won't be alone, John. I'm sending a friend along to keep you company. I have no friends. That's not what pretty Miss Jade DeCamp thinks. She actually felt you were quite redeemable. This is between you and me! She has nothing to do with you! There you go! And what did I tell you about caring for something? That thing too shall be mine. You bastard! You touch her and I'll tear your... Complain! Complain, complain! Yet I always give them exactly what they want. And they always want to take it back. You can't, John Jaspers. Time to die. What are you going to do about that whore doctor? I have something special planned for her, dear. Mr. Vito, I wonder if I could ask you a favor? Margolies. This is Dr. DeCamp. Jade, what's up? I know his name. What? Your John Doe, I got his file. They knew who he was all along. Who is they? Dr. Yamato and the boys in blue. Didn't your boss tell you? Where are you? The Cafe Dante, Sullivan Street. I know the place. I'll be right there. Hey, darling. No... No! What do you want? Shut up! Oh, oh! Looking good! What do you think, brother? Too much blood or not enough? This slasher is our John Doe. He gets sprung from the psych ward and then he kills these punks exactly the same way as the people in the Embassy. His name is John Jaspers. Where'd you get this? I got it from his temp file at the psych ward. They knew his identity all along. Why the hell didn't Marino tell me? Or Dr. Yamato tell me? You're in danger, you know that. When you spoke to Jaspers, did he say anything? - Anything that I can use? - Yes. Classic paranoid narcissism. He believes he's sold his soul to someone called The whole world hangs in the balance. "M"? Master or Mephistopheles, I don't know. It's a title not a name. Schizophrenics often personalize suffering and injustice as some sort of devil tempting them into destructive acts. Okay. Did he mention an organization called "The Hand"? He said he worked for them. What is it? Some sort of crime syndicate. They're into mystic bullcrap, sacrifices, Satanic nonsense, and look at this, headed by a figure named Do you believe it exists? Throughout history there's been all sorts of conspiracy organizations like this. Now, you think they're sick. And Jaspers here, he thinks they're evil, but I know what they are. They're criminals. It's my job to put them away. - How? - I don't know. I think that Jaspers is the key to all of this. Didn't I tell you to stay out of this? Hey, she called me... about John Jaspers. Oh, excuse me, I mean, John Doe. Vito. Where's M? What is it? What's wrong? I gotta talk to M! You can talk to me, Vito. He came out of nowhere! Like some kind of shadow monster. Who? Who came out of nowhere? The demon, he got my boys! I got to see M! That's not such a good idea. First, you need to calm down. Come, play with me. I couldn't do anything, this guy was unstoppable. Boss is gonna think I fucked up. I'll explain it to him. It wasn't my fault. I've never seen so much blood! Fuck 'em. Fuck 'em all. Fuck M. And fuck the asshole with the razor claws. Razor claws? We put him in the ground, and now he's back. Relax, baby, relax. No! Claire! What is it? Huh? Razor claws. Jaspers is dead. You buried him. Of course. You must learn to control yourself. Don't be angry, come play with me. You've had too much and I shouldn't have any. Well, maybe "Razor Claws" will show up here to take care of me. But I'm not the one he wants to see. You are, darling. He has a score to settle. "There will come the day when you care about something..." What if he finds out what you care about? You envy for his freedom. You forget, I made him. I can unmake him. Like when you buried him? And sent him to hell? Maybe it's my turn to make him. Have you wondered what Jaspers would be without me? A mindless force of violence, a loose cannon. Not something you could aim at me, for instance. Have you ever imagined what you would be like without me? Pure desire. Plain and simply... lust. I love your duplicitous games, but you dare not push me too far, dearest. What's going on here? Please... Make it stop! I can't let you expire just yet, now can I? You have a very special role to play. I chose you for a reason. Please help! Know that you betray me only insofar as it serves my purpose. Thank you for reminding me. When there's a problem, it should be taken care of. They're for my protection, on Commissioner Marino's orders. They'll be with me 24 hours a day. I still don't like it. You shouldn't be here at all. You mean, in case he might show up? All clear, sir. We'll be right outside, ma'am, if you need anything. Thanks. You're gonna have to excuse me, Lieutenant. - I'm kind of tired. - Right. Who's this? Your husband? No, it's my father. Looks like a nice guy. He was my hero. He died. Thank you, Lieutenant. You need anything... anything at all, you... you have my number, right? I'm okay. Physically a mess, but emotionally I'm a rock. Don't hurt me! Please, Jade! I cleaned the blades, but they want to get dirty again. What are you doing here? I don't know. I just had to see you. I have to protect you from him. - From who? - M. He wants you. He wants to kill me? He doesn't even know me. Not just to kill you. For something worse, much worse. They all work for him, all of them. John, listen to me. I want you to sit down, and take those things off. M is not gonna get me. Nobody is. I have two policemen here... What? Oh my God! Don't you understand? It's them. They're here! Aah! Hold it! Take this message to your Master! I make such a mess when I play. You're murdering policemen! Why are you allying yourself with these demons he sent? They all work for him. Listen to me, just give yourself up. Then I can help you. Help me? Help you, you mean? Why don't you admit it? I'm the pornography that gets you hot! Code Red! Code Red! Officer down. Assailant is pursuing Dr. DeCamp into the 12th Street subway. Code Red! Code Red! - Lieutenant Margolies? - Jade, where are you? Phone booth, 12th Street subway. Okay, stay put! We're already on our way. Please hurry! You've got to come quickly. I think he's... Jade! He's here. I'm here. Can you hear me? Jade! Jade! Shit! Jade! Margolies! Go! That way! Now! It's okay, now. Yes, it's fine. What's he doing here? This is just for your protection. I never thought it would be you, Jade. What are you talking about? Keep still! This won't take long. - No! - Jade! Just give me your... Jade! Calm down, Jade. Calm down. This is for your own protection. Get off me! No! Get her! Don't let her get away! Hello, Jade. Forget something? Stop or I'll shoot you! Here little piggies, welcome to my show! Enjoying the ride? Soon be at our final destination. Come back here, Jade! Jade! Come on. They all work for M. Move over, Jade! Come back here, Jade! Help me! - I want the girl! - Go get her! Come with me, I'm not gonna hurt you. Hold your fire! I want the girl! Get her, go get her! Please! Get off me! Time to get off! Shit! We lost the girl! I can't go any further. - It's all right. - Not one step. It's all right, we're home. This is your home? Was. What are you? You look at me like I'm less than human. What if I am more than human? That's not true, I don't. Your science blinds you. Violence is our destiny. M is bringing our world to an end, and I've helped prepare the way. - No. - You're afraid. Look at me! I'm a beast, but you want me. I just want to help you. There is a human being under all that rage. The man you're talking about is dead. Let me go! You can't cure evil, Doctor. It's not a sickness. What do you want to do? Rape me? Is that what you want? What do you want? I wanted you the first moment I saw you. This is forever, John. Forever... That's why I couldn't have any lovers. I couldn't love anyone. I was raped when I was 11. By who? I don't know. I don't remember. In my dreams, he has no face. I called him the Smooth Man. His skin was so smooth. They found me. I was bleeding. Sleep and I'll watch over you. I believe the Commissioner has something he wishes to share with us. - Yes? - Hey. How's it going? Hey now. This is something, huh? I'm Lieutenant Margolies, here to see Marino. Is he around? It really is impossible for the Commissioner to be disturbed. That's all right. That's no problem. I can wait. I have a meeting with the Mayor tomorrow morning. He wants to know why the police have failed to apprehend the Embassy killer, John Jaspers. What should I tell him? I could tell him Jaspers should be dead. I could tell him Jaspers seems to have acquired the capacity to survive close range gunshots. I could tell him Jaspers has become a threat to an important ceremony which a group of select individuals have been planning for hundreds of years. I could tell him that the man responsible for Jaspers' actions, the man who "created" him, as he's so fond of saying, has lost the power to control his creation. Of course, if I told him all of that, he'd think I'd gone crazy! What do you think? Am I crazy? Why no, Commissioner. You are confused and deluded and weak. It is you who have failed. And what about the ceremony tonight? Have you lost control of Jaspers? Is there a chance... Chance is a blind goddess. We live in a random, chaotic universe. That's fucking bullshit! The truth is you can't stop him. The more you try, the stronger he gets. Which of you here agrees with the Commissioner? Our victory is at hand. This very night, the beast, Homunculus, will walk the earth again. Have I ever let you down before? Have I not destroyed everyone who ever stood in our way? Do you not have all you ever asked of me? Well, that was a long time ago. You were nothing. I gave you riches. I gave you power. I gave you lives. How soon we forget. I gave you everything you ever hungered for. But you, Commissioner... No! ...you are too hungry. John Jaspers will die tonight. Now get out! You are the Master. Sit down. Bravo, darling, that manifestation was one of your finest. Your power is growing as the Red Giving draws near. How did Jaspers survive? It's impossible. Chaos thrives on the impossible. Jaspers is using the magic for his own end. He's with the whore doctor. Ah, yes. Jade. She's the one who planted the seed of hope in him. She believes in him. Take that belief away, and what have you got? - Hello? - Jade. Where are you? ls Jaspers with you? He's right here, he's sleeping. - Asleep? - But it's okay. Everything is different now. Don't wake him up. But I found out the truth. I'm at the estate of this... this M. He's for real. I saw him. So, Jaspers was right all along. Not only that, I found his contract with M. Now I've got a plan, a way for you to save Jaspers and for me to put away M for good. But I need you to come here right now. Alone. Jade. You have a visitor. Why are you so nervous? Please, Claire. I'm in no mood for your childish seductions. After tonight he'll be whole. He'll have no need of you anymore. You have nothing I want. No? Not even M's secret magic? His darkest, innermost secrets? Secrets? His knowledge, his power. I can give it to you. How? M's power is peaking, and that means he's at his most vulnerable. You know it. Think what we could do, Yuri. Just the two of us. Do you realize what you're saying? Only what we've both been thinking for a long time now. There's no retirement plan with M. Once he's through with you... How can I trust you? You can't. You balance the drugs he needs to keep his body going. Improvise something tonight. Something permanent. Then, you and I will proceed with the Rite of Red Giving. Except we won't be doing the giving. It's in here. "...signumque crucis quod nunc facio, et per vots nostra." "May Mephistopheles himself now rise up to serve us." Dr. DeCamp, this is indeed a pleasure. How could you? Oh, don't you dare judge me, you hypocrite. Did you have a good time last night? Such color in your cheeks. You should let the rutting beast have his way with you more often. I want to make a deal with you. We do understand each other. I love deals. Let John out of his agreement. And if I don't? Will you sue me? Call the police? You think this is all just some wild hallucination, don't you? What satisfaction can you possibly get from tormenting John Jaspers? Is that a riddle? Bear with me, I'm a little out of practice. Stop it. Wait, I know. What do you call a woman who seeks to make a monster into a man, if the poor wench believes that all men truly are monsters? You can never forgive men for the harm they've done, for the terror, the pain, the humiliation. So you read my file. You want Jaspers' freedom from me? Very well. It's a deal. His freedom in exchange for something you'll never use anyway. - Your body... - No! ...to serve as the vessel for my seed. So am I sick enough for you now, Doc? You know, for along time I refused to accept it, but the truth will not be denied. He will not be denied. I was blind, but he let me see that he is the truth, and sooner or later, he always wins. Every time. Always has and always will. And that is the truth. Jade? Jade! Jade! After tonight I will need this no more. My body will regenerate itself. That's correct. You seem nervous, Yuri. Oh, it's nothing, sir. What... have you... done? Don't fight it. You'll be dead in under a minute. Let me go! We have a pact. It was Claire! She made me do it! Heard that one before. Aah! Time to give the devil his due. Honey, I want a divorce. Three... two... one. Boss. You killed the Boss. I'm the Boss, now. Ha, why should we take orders from you? Because mine is bigger than yours. Claire, no, please. I'm with you, you know. Go and get me Dr. DeCamp. Now! Do you like your new room, Doctor? - Who are you? - You can call me M. Claire. Didn't Jaspers tell you about me? He fucked me before he ever fucked you. Does that make you angry? Or hot? Angry. Pay attention to me when I am talking. You are such a weak, pathetic Barbie. Come on. M always had a weakness for innocence. I can understand that. It is so delicious to corrupt. What are you doing to me? Please, let me go. I can help you. I can help you. You believe there are only two roles for a woman in this world, don't you? Victim and whore. You are the victim, and I am the whore. But there's a third way, sweetheart. You kill the man who owns you, and you become master. Now, I'm going to give you the gift of lust, to revel in and enjoy, pleasure unending, and pain everlasting. Let me taste you, Doctor. Let your blood rise with the power that is mine. Then you will be ready for the Red Giving. No, please, don't... don't hurt me. Don't deny who you are. It's a pleasure you already enjoy. Go deep in the pain, and remember. Remember. Remember. Remember... Now, you are the whore. Pain and pleasure are one. No! Daddy! Surprised to see me? Oh, sweet chosen companion of my life's path. No! We have thrown his petty planet into chaos. Violent flux. Borders disintegrate, as do alliances. Genocide and civil war rise exponentially. Tonight, at last, our Rite of Red Giving. Tonight, at last, we witness the birth of Homunculus, the beast who will bring us a new day. Our day! Diabolus Satanus... All elements conspire in you, Jade. Virgo to my Homunculus. Diabolus Satanus... Diabolus Satanus... Drive all doubt from your hearts. Happiness forever is within our reach. Unlimited power is ours. Please, Master! Forgive me! I beheld an angel come down from heaven, having the key to the bottomless pit, and a great chain in his hand. The angel laid hold on the serpent. Yea, the angel laid hold on the serpent, and cast him into the pit and set a seal upon him to hold him for a thousand years, that he should deceive the nations no more, until the thousand years should pass. The day men call "Walpurgisnacht," then shall he be loosed. Diabolus! Now is the time come. Diabolus Satanus... Let him be born through the son of man! Yes. All my life I've wanted the truth. Now I am the truth! Let the giving begin! Pick me! Rejoice! Rejoice, friends! We are not going to hell. Hell is here! What have you done to her? Jade! Mmm... Johnny boy! He hasn't done anything to me... that I didn't want him to! You won't lose me, Johnny. This is forever, just you and me... and him... and him. No! Oh, Johnny? Anyone home? Patient seems to have gone into a catatonic fugue state. He needs a jump-start. I know you're in there, Johnny. I'm glad you could drop by. You didn't really have a choice. You never have. You were always mine, and mine alone. The time of the beast is upon us. I think you're really going to like the crucial moment of the ritual. The consummation. Daddy! Noo! The beast has been summoned. Now you understand, John. She's mine. Just like you are. You can't escape destiny, John. Isn't it obscenely beautiful? When daddy raped you, you loved it. It was the only love you ever knew. It was all you ever wanted. And that man is trying to take it away. He needs to be punished. Homunculus! When his head comes off, rub the stump. It'll be hot and wet, just the thing for daddy's girl. Homunculus. Homunculus. Aah! It won't work, M. No! You were the most perfect disciple I've ever had, John Jaspers. The most passionate. The closest to my own voraciousness. I'll have you. My way. We have a pact. You can't touch me. I'll see you burn in hell forever! No more tricks. Let him go! You want your precious lover's soul back? What will you give me in return? Whatever you want. The soul of your unborn child. You're insane. Don't, Jade! I guarantee John Jaspers' release from me. It's a deal. Your contract is dead, and so are you. The child and you are mine. Not quite. You should have done your homework. I can't have children. When I was raped, I was just 11, but the damage wasn't only mental. I have no womb. I thrive on the impossible. I can't move. I'm... dead. No, John! You're not! It's just another of his tricks, don't you see? Remember. Remember us. You're dead! I buried you. You're dead! We're both dead. Don't leave me. From the moment I tasted revenge, my fate was sealed. Sometimes I can see the painting on the blank canvas, and in my body I feel my art. Subtitles by explosiveskull
