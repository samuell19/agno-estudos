What's wrong? Are you all right? I'm just catching my breath. Don't you feel well? | just need some water. I'll go with you. Come on, honestly, is something the matter? No. We don't have to dance it all today, do we? No. Of course not... But you know what the problem is, right? You can't keep up with me. And do you know why, my love? Because, with my Fred Astaire shoes, no one can keep up, I'm unstoppable. You're so silly. So silly. How did I put up with you for all these years? You're not that smart, maybe? Hey, what's going on? Are we here to dance or to tallC? You dance. Go on, dance while I get some water. Are you sure you don't want me to go with you? No, feel free to dance with another woman. Are you letting me steal him? Mrs. Rosa, aren't you feeling well? Where's Joaquim? Do you want me to go look for him? No, no, just some water... What's going on? Did the music stop? Is there a doctor around here? What's going on? Let me through, please, let me through. Where's Gui? Where's our son? I don't know. Probably outside. Mom, I'll be right back. Excuse me... Gui, what are you doing here? Why aren't you inside, next to your grandmother? I don't want to see grandpa dead. Gui... I want to remember him alive, when he told me stories and took me to the football match. You'll remember him always, my love. Always. But it's not the same thing. I know, darling. I know. Let's go inside and be next to grandma, olC? She's so sad that you're not there by her side. This is life, right? One minute you're fine and all of a sudden... At what time is the cremation? Sorry! Sorry... I really need to get this. Give me a minute... Hey, Zé... Yeah, I called... no, it's just that my father-in-law died... the old man died and I can't take long, I need to get back inside... Tell me something. A while back, you said that a friend of yours, a diplomat, wanted an apartment with a nice view over Lisbon... l thinkl have something that he might be interested in... I should have taken his shoes off... What for, mom? They're new. And he was so proud of his new shoes. Do you think he'll need them... or is it best if I keep them? Mommy, keep them for what? I don't know. I kept the wedding ring, his pen and watch, all the things that he loved... I should have kept the shoes as well. I shouldn't have let you dance without me. What time is it? lt's three months later. It can't be. It can. Of course it can. Do you think I don't remember the day I died? It's one of those things that's hard to forget, right? You're so silly. Look at this. You don't even open the drapes, the sun never comes in, you have no idea if it's night or day. | feel asleep, time passed by and I didn't even notice it. Since we're at it, tell me something. How do you plan on living? You don't even go out to pick up your pension check! You're right. And how about me? You keep promising to throw my ashes in the river and I'm still in that pot. Who will I talk to then? Rosa... Come on... All right, yes, I'll take care of the pension check. It's a couple of Euros, maybe I can buy some cigarettes. Listen... What's this? You're not planning on spending the rest of your life grieving, are you? A beautiful woman like you? Do you think so? Ofcourse I do. Or the wind smokes more than we do. Are you kidding or what? So? Did it hit the spot? Fintasl Let's go, kid, - Let's go. - Take it easy, man. - Let's go... - Easy, man... Are you kidding me? You take so long... Thank you. Can I get some change for the cigarettes? My purse? My purse was right here. As anyone seen my purse? Here, kid... You can keep this. It looks like the old lady is a fan ofthe same club as you are. What's with you today? Let me keep the ring. The fuck you will. ...you're not even old enough to be married, so be quiet, yeah? You don't even fuck. What do you mean, I don't fuck, man? Yeah, you fuck your right hand, I know. Shit, twenty Euros, that's it. What did you thinlC? What did you say? Old people live with next to nothing. Don't you watch the news? They don't have a pot to piss on. Fuck, do I watch the news? You're kidding me, man. I couldn't care less, dude... fuck old people... Come on, l have an idea. Let's move. - Come on. - Let's go, man. I need to take a piss. Excuse me, is this yours? - What? - Is it yours? No, I don't think so... but thanks. The money? Where's my money? How the hell should I know... what an asshole... I'll take you home. No way... Come on, that way I'll get to know where you live. Are you insane or what? Just think about it, my parents seeing me with you? I'd be grounded for a whole year. Yeah, right. You're always fucking around and you always get away with it. I know, but my parents have no idea. And, just as long as I don't show up pregnant or hit a teacher, they couldn't care less... Alright, I might as well go home too... my father is probably waiting for me for dinner. All right... Here... In two days, you hear? Or you better buy some crunches because I 'rn gonna fuck your legs up. Do you hear me, motherfucker? And then I'll take care of your hands, so you won‘t steal again. It wasn‘t my fault, let me explain... I don‘t want to hear it. You lose it, you pay it. Five hundred euros. Did you hear me or do I have to repeat it? Say 0k, ﬁve hundred fucking Euros. 0k, 0k. Five hundred Euros. Five hundred fucking Euros. What just happen? Do you have cigarettes? What did that guy want? Give me a cigarette, come on. Light! Hey, listen, kid, so you're fucking that redheaded girl, right? The one with the money? You're smart, kid. Just like me. No, I'm not like you. I took care of you so you can now talk shit to me, is that it? Give me that! What the fuck do you want? You have a full packet and you only give one cigarette to your father? That's my boy... what's that shit? Sardines, I know you like them. What the fuck for? It's my birthday. Eighteen. It's a special day. Or, at least, it should be. Eighteen, is it? Happy birthday! Now you're really useless. You're not even a check now. You can't even kick a ball. Fuck, if you really wanna know... maybe you're not even my son. What are you good for? For giving you cigarettes. Get lost! Wait... you forgot your stuff. Here, take this shit out of here. I don't want it, get out of my sight... you're just like your mother. Just for tonight, Tita, please? No, no, everything's good, I just wanna be with you. It would be like in the movies, I would sneak into your room and... No, no, I really can ‘t... Are you there, Job? Ok, cool, no problem. l have to go, I'm running out of credits and... hello? Tita? Fuck! - Hello, Joao. How are you? - Good. - ls mom there? - Yes, she is. Who is it? Go inside and play with your sister, come on. I want to speak with my mother. She's busy. Who is it, Ricardo? Nobody. How many times have I told you to not come around here? I want to speak with my mother. Forget it, if you want money, you have another thought coming. We know where the money goes. | just wanna talkto her. - No. - Why? Because I don't want shit in my house. Mom?! - Go back inside. - l'm eighteen today. Go back inside. l'm eighteen, dammit! So what? Eighteen? Do you know what's the only thing that changes in your fucking life? Now you can go to jail... Your soup... Here it is... have a good night. Joaquim, want a nice warm chickpea soup? Here it is... good night. Get out of my bed, get out ofthere... you're in my bed. Give me that shit. Give me by backpack. This is my house. Get back here. Come here, you thief. Motherfucker. Come here. Get back here, man. Need some money, mom? No, I keep some at home. And] can go to the A TM machine... Go to the ATM... how, if you lost your card? Why didn‘t you call me straight away? They took my cell phone as well. And I don't know your number by heart, I can't remember. And what if I didn't have a key, mom? Goon, mom... All your medication is in this tray. And I got you this pretty little box where you can put your pills in... there's also a note with the hours when you need to take them. You have to promise me you won't forget, you hear? You sound like your father... always worrying about my pills and... as it turned out, it was he who... What is this, mom? Smoking? You're old enough to have some sense. Tomorrow, there'll be new locks on the door and I'm buying you a new cell phone. I'll drop Gui at the school and it's the day when I'll have to spend hours at the court. So much trouble. Well... Most importantly, I don't even want to think about what could have happen to you. What were you doing in the street? Your father told me to... Dad has been dead for three months, mom. Again with the crazy tallC? You worry me, that's why I don't want to leave you alone. Who told you that I'm alone? Are you sure that you don't want me to stay over tonight? No, don't worry... Go. - Are you sure, mom? - Go, I'm fine. - Anything you need, just tell me. - I'll be all right. It's no lie, you know? What? You're completely alone. l have you. Me? I can't take you out to dance. I can't have dinner with you in a restaurant with a view to the river. l have our daughter for that. Our daughter... Our daughter has her own life. Besides that, poor thing, for her to remember to breathe, she needs to put it down in her schedule. l have our friends... When was the last time you saw them? I'm so stupid. I took your wedding ring and now! lost it... Rosa... Something needs to change in your life. Shit! You think it's wrong? Here are your keys, all ready to work. Thank you. How much do I owe you? Don't worry, Mrs. Rosa, your daughter took care of everything. Have a nice day. I won't be long... just going to the grocery. Ok. Makes me anxious, the boy hasn't eaten all day. And you have no idea how scared I was when I saw him sitting on that ledge. How doesn't he have vertigo? Well, you treat him like a cat... and you know perfectly well that cats don't have vertigo. Rosa, long time no see. We thought you went to live with your daughter. No. Been busy, that's all. Where's Mr. Manel? - The butcher? - Yes. Closed shop. Went bankrupt a month ago. By the look of it, I'm next... Mrs. Rosa. How are you? Good, I'm good... Glad to see you. Give me a hand, I need to carry these bags to my kitchen. Sure. And then I'll make you lunch. There's no need for that, really. Come on, it's enough for everybody. Thank you. l'm cooking some veal with chickpeas, do you like it? I love it. ...and I lost my job. Who needs a designer these days? In the meanwhile, the banktook my apartment, so I'm going back home. Didn't you try to sell the apartment? Yeah, I did, but nobody's buying in this market. I know... Yeah, but, you know, I'm moving back with my parents, help with whatever they need, maybe try my hand at farming, feed the chickens... How about you, Mrs. Rosa, will you be all right all by yourself? Sometimes, I have company... Oh, another thing... I left some things up there, on the roof, nothing of worth, just some junk... if you know of someone who can use it... Wow, that smells good. I'm going to miss your cooking. Thirty-six Euros and forty three cents. See you, mom. I'm sorry... Here. Look at this, man... It's flat. What do you want? For me to bring a fridge as well? - Yes. Want some? - No. Have you seen Tita? Nop. I think she's in trouble. Her parents found out she was skipping school. Tell her to call me, I don't have credits on my cell. Sure. You can't smoke! - lt'sjust a puff. - No. - Just one. - No. You're sad. I'm not. Why should I be sad? Then you're distracted. You could have finished that game ages ago... may I? Look, my love, here. You're right, I missed that... Maybe you're right... I'm sad... Do you think he's coming back? Hear that? It's him! I told you he'll be back! Take it easy, you'll be all right. Hey, good evening... I need an ambulance, please... Costa do Castelo Street, number 16 and it's the last floor. Yes, ok, ok... Thank you. I'll go there. He says it's his father's. So you're saying this belongs to your father, is it? - Yes. - And where is he? Dead. - Dead? - Yes... Want the watch or not? Four hundred. No, I need five hundred. Four hundred. Four hundred fifty? Fuck... ok. Looking better, Mrs. Rosa, looking better. Eleven over six, doctor. Eleven over six... So, Mrs. Rosa, how are you feeling? Well... You're lucky we got to you fast. Despite the concussion, the exams don't reveal any kind of damage. Mother... How is she, doctor? Don't worry, I'm all right. How can I not worry, mother? Who called the emergency service? I didn't get who... I think it was your father. Mother... This stairs... I don't know how you can do it. Mother, now you're just gonna sit here, rest and watch some TV, and I'll fix you something to eat. Sound? Thank you. Mother, what have you been eating? There's nothing in the fridge. There's no eggs, no milk, no butter. I'll have to go out and get some food, right? I can't find your father. I think you really need some rest. Let's do that? Come on... Here, just rest quietly, ok. You're not going anywhere. I'll stay here with you. Oh, I'm fine. I don't need.. lfl need anything, I'll call. I'll be right here... I'm gonna make a call and postpone a meeting I had and... I wanna be here. Thank you... But I... No more talking. Now rest... Try to get some sleep. How much do you have there? Three hundred fifty. All right... all right... It's all l have. lfyou give me more time, I can get the rest later. Leave the cash on top of the table. Do you know why I'm taking it, kid? Because you have balls. And I'm always looking for guys with balls who wanna work. I can walk your dog, if you want. Ten Euros an hour. My yankee... I had to get rid ofthe dog when my baby was born... Those dogs are fucked. You can train them and they'll behave for a while. But then comes the day when they lose their sense of smell and stop recognizing people and return to their true nature and there's nothing you can do. And do you know what's their true nature, kid? To fuck people up. To rip their skin off and eat their flesh. But that's not only dogs. Some people are also born that way and there's no changing them. Like you father. No, my father is not like that. Your father is a fucking looser who was born without a sense of smell. And you shouldn't go around trying to save him. You should be smart like me. Get rid of that dog and go about your life... Go, get out of here. Fuck. "...it's when my father is really drunk that he starts looking for a fight "and that's why, last night, as soon as I opened the door "and after he called me a useless piece of shit "and the son of a whore, "he was talking about my mother, obviously, "he punched me and after he tried to kick me, which he failed at doing "because he was so pissed that he couldn't stand straight. "And I wanna take the opportunity to thank the inventors of alcohol, "because that was what saved me from another one of those massive beatings. "Two sides for every coin, I guess. "But, as l was saying, "it was that same night that I had one of the strangest dreams "that my brain has ever come up with. "Especially considering that I usually dream with boobs." You're right. He's a cute kid. And now! understand why he still hasn't talked to you... he's better at putting his thoughts on paper. "I dreamt that l was walking down the street..." It must be Luisa. Hello. Feeling better? Yes, better now... Listen, I'm staying here with you tonight. No... It's not up for discussion, mom... Tomorrow's Saturday. l have the day off. Gui doesn't have school. We'll keep you company. I'm gonna cook you dinner now. Just be quiet, olC? Don't go anywhere. I don't wanna be cremated. I want to be in a grave where people who love me can bring flowers. Well, well... So you're bach? Or are you just leaving? Take it easy, don't be in a hurry. Seat there, please. Did you hear me? Sit! Where did you get the money? Why didn't you give it to me? Why did you give it to that motherfucker? Didn't I tell you to keep out of my business? Do you have more? Fuck, fifty Euros? What have you been doing? Where did you get the fucking money? Does that matter? What is it to you? I saved your ass, dammit. l was trying to help you out! Grandma, dinner is ready Coming, sweetheart. No problem, you can stay in my room. You'll have to sleep on the fucking floor but, either than that, the house is yours. Sure... it's only for tonight... I'll leave first thing in the morning. Have to pick up some shit. And, as you know, if my mother comes around with a client, we have to take off. She rings before to warn us... She takes care of them in half an hour, or less. Daniel, where are you, I can't see you... Your husband is right there. Where? Here. Mommy, I need to talkto you... How are you? Can we talk, mom? Talk about what? Hey, I thought you were already home. So, have you talked to her yet? - Not yet. - Talk about what? The buyer. The buyer? What buyer? A buyer for your apartment. And listen, getting one these days, with the crisis, is close to a miracle. You need to consider it, sweet Rosa. Consider what? Selling your apartment. Make some good money and them we'll find a place for you to go. Speaking of which, we found a great one, where some nice people will take care of you for the rest of your days. Even I wouldn't mind that, I admit. I would love it. If it's that good, why don't you go then? Is there a minimum age limit to go to a retirement home? Try it out. They might take you in. Rosa, I'm just trying to help... Why did you bring me here? Mother... please... I'm not leaving my home. If everything goes according to plan, l'll die there. lf l'll lucky, in my sleep, on the same bed where I slept with Joaquim for more that forty years. And, if I'm really lucky, it'll happen tomorrow, so I don't have to listen to this stupid conversation again. Mother! Let's calm down... You can't be alone, Rosa. What if something happens to you, then what? Ok, so I'll come and live with you. I won't be alone then. You know perfectly well that we don't have the room or the means at our place. Right, right. Five times I said that word. And now I'm leaving. I'm going home. Mother! Your mother completely lost her mind. Where's my noteboolC? Where's my husband? And the watch? Where's the watch? Ok, one thing at a time. You put Joaquim in the fridge? Weren't you lucky it didn't turn out in the trash? And listen... good thing you left the door open, either wise who would have called the ambulance, right? Can I have my notebook now? Take it easy, one thing at a time... The watch? I sold it. Needed the cash. You sold the... you sold the watch? How much did you get for it? Five hundred... Yes... around that... Come with me. Here's five hundred Euros. Go get the watch. And, next time you need money... the bills are in this drawer. My jewels are in the support table. Take what you want. But don't touch Joaquim's things. Here... Wait a second... You're telling me all this, just like that... are you crazy or what? I don't think so. Yeah, because I heard you talking to yourself. Then maybe I am. Listen, ok, this is how it's gonna go. I'll go get your thing, I bring it to you, you give me my notebook and | get the hell out of here. It's simple. Here... and just a second, I'll be right back. - But where are you going? - Wait... Here... No. No. You're being crazy again. If you give me the notebook now, | get the hell out of here and you won't see the money or the watch again. Don't you fucking get it? No, you won't get the hell out of here. You'll be back. You know why? Because, here, you have a beautiful view of Lisbon. Did I do wrong? Didn't I tell you the kid was all right? He did good. Look... there's more. We need to make copies of it or it will all get lost. l thinkthere's time. I'll be right back. Rosa! How about this? - Joaquim... - No, my love, please. Listen, do you really thinkthat I want to spend the rest of eternity stuck in a lousy TuppenNare? No... Promise? I promise. Today? Today... May | help you? A copy each. In bookform. Would you like plastic or metal binding? The cover in plastic and make the binding metal. I'm sorry, I'm a little late, I needed to buy some things... Sure, here. Give me the backpack now. No, in a minute, I have some stuff inside... I used it to carry my things. Come up. Here. Cool, we're even. Bye. Wait. I need you to come with me to a place. I need you to do something for me. It won't be any trouble, it won't take long. Listen, I came here to bring you your stuff... And you gave me mine. That was the deal. Shall we? But why do you think I'm going anywhere with you, can you tell me that? | just need your help. Come. In what world do you live in? Do you really think things happen just because you ask nicely? Come. Can you tell me what you want? Fuck, man, are you kidding me? I don't think it's allowed to throw ashes in the river. I need you to distract people. Yeah, you're crazy, dude. Plain crazy. Have a light? I wish, but they don‘t let me smoke. Is Benﬁca winning or what? Benﬁca doesn‘t play today Who's playing then? Who's playing? Nobody’s playing. This is radio Amalia, you get it? "Don't come late, you tell me with tenderness..." Carlos Ramos. Do you know who it is? Carlos? No, I don't... This is vintage, young man. Vintage? What's that? lt's special, unique. You get it? Ei, what are you doing, mam? You can't smoke in here... I can't? Since when? Since when? I don't know. Since two thousand and something or other. Two thousand and something? But we're in nineteen eighty-four. Nineteen eighty... No, lady, two thousand thirteen. Two thousand... that's way into the future. The future? I'm sure we're in nineteen eighty-four. I swear by the health of General Eanes. And we got rid of the fascist ten years ago and you have the nerve to tell me what I can't do? Are you gonna ask me for the permit to the lighter? Can you prove that we're in the year two thousand and... What did he say? Two thousand and... Two thousand thirteen. I'll be dead in two thousand thirteen! How can I prove that to you? Go and lookfor a newspaper or something. A newspaper? Ei, do you have the Correio da Manha? Give a couple of minutes. Joaquim, since they started with this non-smoking laws, did this all the time. It's one of the good things of being old, we pass easily as being senile... We got married in prison... Wait a second... In prison? Yes, other times. We were arrested just because we wanted to speak freely and fight against the dictatorship... But what did you do? Fight people? Or break shit up? People weren't arrested just for opening their mouths...? Those who want to control others, the first thing they do is tell them to shut up and don't let anybody speak against anything. They had PIDE, censorship... Salazar, do you know who he was? And Joaquim wasn't the kind of man who would stay quiet... And neither was I. That's why we were married in prison. I remember it well, when he put the wedding ring on my finger, it was like we were making love. I know... these things are corny... When we put the weeding rings on each other, we couldn't let those sons of bitches realize what we were feeling. When it was my turn to give him the ring... I swear, in that moment, I felt my heart grow in size... as if it was about to explode. And now the wedding ring, his wedding ring, was stolen and I lost it. l was stupid. How long was he in jail for? Two years. l was in for six months. What? You were arrested too? They put women in jail as well? Women, men, old and young... Luisa was already born and l was pregnant again. I left her with my parents. Still today, I think she feels as if she was abandoned but... it wasn't easy. then they hit me so hard and for so long that I lost my baby. Two thousand thirteen. That's right. You can't smoke here, lady. Thank you. - You're really crazy. - You, as well? Me as well, what? My daughter is always telling me I'm crazy and now you as well? How about mad? Can I call you that? Sure. Then let me tell you something. You're mad, woman. I'm not a woman anymore. I'm an old lady. No, you're not. Do you know what you are? You're "vintage". Rosa? "I had to go out. I'll be back later. Lunch is in the fridge." - Good morning? - Good morning. - Can I sit here? - You can sit wherever you want. l was told this is a nice place to work at. That's what they say. Can I get you anything? Is it too early for a glass of wine? That sounds like a brilliant idea. What a trip... Whose house is this? A friend. A friend? But don't tell anyone where I'm staying at, do you hear me? But who's the bitch? Is there reason for me to be jealous? Don't be stupid... Get real, are you kidding? This old bag? Really? Job, no wonder this house smells like mildew. Come on, don't say that. You shit, you're going to rip off the old lady, that's why you don't want anybody to know... Do you really think so? Yeah, right... just go get a bottle, let's fuck up this joint, I'll let you fuck me anywhere you want, what do you say? Why are you looking at me like that for? Isn't that what you want? Then just wait a while, I come a lot faster if I'm high. But get me a drink, come on. Get the fuck out... You're kidding. Open the door. Are you kidding me, motherfucker? You think you're worth something? You're not worth shit. James can fuck me better than you. Even Fintas! Here he is, the missing in action! What's up, kid? Listen, Tita called me and said that you're fucking this old thing. Give me the ring. Come on, don't start with your shit. Dude, you're tripping... l have some stuff... let's go. Give me the ring! What? The wedding ring we stole from the old lady. Give it to me. What are you doing, man? Kid, I think it's better if you let me go and leave. Give me that shit. Give him the ring, man. Ok. - Dude, Job, are you alright? - Leave him in the fucking ground. - But he didn't do anything. - Shut up and follow me... - Give me the wedding ring, you shit. - Get the fuck off of me. Stop it! You think I'm a piece of shit, don't you? I'm not a piece of shit, do you hear me? Do you hear me? Give it to him, James. Oh my God. What happen? Tell me! What happen? I'm sorry. Job, l have to touch you to take care of you... come on, let me... There, there, its done... You'll be all right, but I thinktomorrow you should go to the hospital. No, I'm leaving. Leaving? But why should you leave? You have to get rid of me before I hurt you, Rosa. But what makes you think I want to get rid of you? Think about it this way: I helped that she was robbed, I took her keys but, if it wasn't for that, you wouldn't have come to my roof and you wouldn't have been here to call the ambulance and we both wouldn't be here right now. That's life, the good and the bad. You went through some bad and ugly things in your life, things you saw and wish you didn't, but there's nothing you can do about it now. You see? So the important thing is from now on. What do you want to do with your life? I don't know... This is ruined. Go take a long bath and I'll get dinner ready, olC? You miss him, don't you? Whom? Joaquim? I do. Very much. Sometimes I think how happy he would be to meet you. No, I don't think so. I mean, if my own mother grew tired of me when she met another guy and started another family. She's not even interested in knowing who I am. imagine Joaquim. How about your father? Him... My only good memory of him is when l was standing on his shoulders, climbing up a street that led to our home, my mother was still around, so you see... And, yeah, I also remember the time he took me to a Benfica game. l was about seven... after that... It's funny, you know, when I saw the Benfica symbol on your keychain... I don't know, in that moment, it felt as if you were the only person in the world with whom I had something in common. Want some? No, | feel like having a beer, is that old Yes. - Thank you. - Help yourself. I know: hero. What? That's what I wanna do with my life. Remember you asked me before? Be a hero and always pull it off, just like in the movies and books. What? You don't think! can be a hero? There's a book that Joaquim translated, the book he loved the most, and it's the story of a kid with a difficult childhood who never lets himself be defeated. Do you know what the first line is? No. "Whether I shall turn out to be the hero of my own life, "or whether that station will be held by anybody else..." And what happen? What did he do? He became a writer! lt's ready. l have something I need to tell you. What? | read the things you write. I read your notebooks. Are you ok with that? That's all useless, I don't even know why I keep doing that. Don't say that. All Joaquim did in prison was write. He said writing was the best antidote against loneliness and despair. And he also used to say that a book can change a life. Here's to you. You're not gonna get that? No, let it ring... Nobody has ever read my stuff. I'm very glad it was you. Thank you. A protest was called through the social networks... Next time, I'm going. And I'm going with you. What? Come on, it's your turn now. Look, there's nothing here. Why did you have a band-aid if you're fine? Maybe I needed aid and I don't anymore. - Where do I put it? - There. Mother? Mom? Mom, what's going on? Do you know how long I've been trying to call? What's this? A friend. A friend? Yes, well, actually, he lives here. We're roommates, as they now say. What? Sorry, Rosa, let's get back to the beginning to see if! understand this. Where did the kid come from? Sorry, this is just too weird. What's going on here? - Maybe you should leave... - Stop. Mom, can you tell me what's this thing doing here? Maybe we should check and see if anything's missing. What's your problem? What do you want? What are you looking at? Want me to call the cops, is that it? What the hell are you doing here? Taking advantage of an old lady that doesn't even know which planet she's on? Stop it! Job, sit down. You're in my home and you don't need to go anywhere. Yes, because the truth is that this is still my home and this is still my life. And these are my decisions. lfyou want to stay and have dinner, that's fine. OthenNise, you can get the hell out of here. Get the hell out...? Rosa, sorry to say this, but you completely lost your mind. Listen, mom, I'm still your daughter. And I worry about you and I don't understand... No, Luisa, I'm like a job you hate. Well. I'm leaving... I can't deal with this... Rosa, believe what you want... but this kid is gonna rob you. He's gonna rob you! And here l was thinking my family was fucked. They can get the hell out... Who is it? It's me, Job... it's your father. Fuck... Open the door, come on. | just want to know how you are, if you need anything. Open the fucking door! Can I come in? What are you doing here, man? Nice digs... Look, you wanna tallC? Let's go outside, have a beer, it's on me. Do you know what pisses me off? How should I know what pisses you off... You go around pretending to be a fucking saint, trying to make me feel bad because I do this and that and here you are, living off an old lady, waiting to rip her off. It's not like that, she's my friend. Cut the bullshit, I know everything. Tita told me... Tita? That's right. You should know by now, you're old enough... bitches are all the same. Don't, get out ofthere. When they get mad at you, they become vengeful whores, like you mother... What...? Put that shit back. Get the fuck off of me. Put that fucking shit back. Put that shit back and I'll tell you where the money and the jewels are... Fuck. Here, Mrs. Rosa. How's it going? Well... I might finish it today. That's a shame. Job? Job? I can‘t pick up, leave a message. If you have good news, call later. Be cool. What did I tell you? What did he take? Doesn't matter. It doesn't matter? You bring a delinquent into your home, he robs you, takes advantage of you, and it doesn't matter? He'll be back, I'm sure, it wasn't him. Then why did he run away, tell me that! Sure, I'll hold... Who is your husband on the phone with? - The police, who do you thinlC? - Don't do that. Yes, I will, Rosa. You might not care about what happens to you, but I do. I worry about you. I told you this is my home. Yes, yes, l'll hold... Give me a week. If he doesn't show up in a week, I'll go to any retirement home you want. And now leave, please! Let's go. Alright, but I'll stay here tonight. No! Why don't you pick up? Pick up and tell the truth? She wouldn't believe me. And I would have to say that my father did it, don't you see? So what? Fuck your old man, dude. Tell the truth. You're really not answering it? Turn it off at least, man... I don't want her to think that I hung up on her. How's the motherfucker? Who? James? He's all fucked up, how do you think he is? How about you, man? How are you, dude? I'm all fucked up, how do you think I am? So, tell me again... who's this Job? You'll find out if you read him. And, when you do, you'll want to publish him. It's very interesting, Joaquim read it and loved it. Joaquim read it? - He did and loved it. - That's great. His contact is here, but he doesn't know that I brought it to you. Mysterious... How about you, Rosa? How are you? - Fine. - Fine? Yes. You look sad... Well, I'll read it and get back to you later, OK? - Thank you so much. - You're welcome. And Rosa? You have no idea how much we miss Joaquim around here. Tell me about it. I can only imagine. Bye. Gracias. What are you doing here? Keeping you company. Can I? You should know by now that, if you want to talkto a drunk, you should try and do that in the morning. So, how do you do this? A sip ofthe beer and then a sip of the "bagaco"? Or you just do a shot? Fuck. That's good! Bastos, another "bagaco". Want another? Are you gonna stop with that shit? Bring us two. So, how much money we made, with the old lady's jewels? Quiet! You hear me? Quiet. - Everything olC? - Everything's perfect. I think you should go home. What for? This is so much better. Fuck, this is fantastic, man. Listen, wanna know what I've been thinking? That we're gonna get much better from now on. You shit on me, mother shits on us and now | shit on everything. We'll be a family of shitters. A family of shitters! No more "bagaco". Fuck, Alberto, do something! What? You're leaving already? You fuck my life up, make me lose the only person that was good to me and now you leave me by myself? Job? Hold this. It's a friend of my son's. Help me take him inside. I should go. Come on, nothing to be afraid. He's out of it. He'll sleep until tomorrow. Come on. Who is it? I'm sorry. I found this purse and it had some keys inside, along with an envelope with this address. The name is Rosa Correia. I want to return them. She doesn't live here anymore. She moved to a retirement home. A home? Yes, but you can leave all that here if you want. The daughter's husband usually comes around, I can give it to him. No, no, I rather take it there myself, maybe there's a reward or something. Can you tell me where that retirement home is? Just give me a moment, I need to check. Mrs. Rosa? You have a visitor. It's your grandson. Gui? No, he said his name is Job. Job? Give me a hug. I'm a friend of Job. I said I was your grandson so they would let me in. Tell your friend I don't have anything else for him to steal. His father is the one who robbed the apartment. Why should I believe that? Mrs. Rosa has a grandson, Gui, was married to Mr. Joaquim and has a daughter called Luisa. You like to smoke in places where you can't and you're "vintage", and that means you're special, the most special lady in Lisbon. Do you know how I know this? Because Job told me so. He doesn't stop talking about you, dude, he's boring the shit out of me. Can we sit down for a while? Where have you been, man? Around... Rosa? You're gonna ask me in? Where is he? in case his mother walks in with a client. Said he was gonna smoke a joint. Shall we? Why do you insist? lnsist? Yes, why don't you just give up on me? Why are you good to me? Why me? Because... of all the rooftops in Lisbon and the world, you chose mine. That's all the clothes you have? Are you gonna use them all the time? Don't look at me like that or you're gonna make me cry. Come on, let's go. Job, do me a favor, go downstairs and buy me cigarettes, olC? Daniel is on his way, mom. We need to talk. No. Let's do one thing: not talk. Let's read. Read? Read what, mom? You know, it's like your father used to say: all answers are already in writing. What did I fucking say? Didn't I tell you to go away? What are you doing here? What did I say? Did you really think you would keep feeding of the old bag? Do you think everyone is entitled to the good life? Is that it? Because they aren't! And do you know why? Because there's not enough caviar to go around! Let go of me, fucker! Get lost! Let me tell you something. If you think she's going to support you, you fucking pimp, she isn't. You know something? - What. - I think! got my sense of smell back. And you smell funny, man. Channel for men, kid. No, no, I think its arsenic. Get out of my car! Luisa! Your husband is here. Get out of there. Did you know that all life know on Earth, from the flea to the whales, Men or orchid, has a chemical base of six elements? What are you going on about? - Do you wanna know? - Get out of my car! What's happening? Carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, sulfur and phosphorus. Man, I'm gonna fuck you up! But NASA should study you or some shit like that. Because, if they take a good look at you, they'll consider the chance that there's people that stink of arsenic. Fuck... I'm gonna put you in jail, do you understand? Did you know arsenic is a highly toxic element. I'm calling the cops. You'll see, you piece of shit. I don't give a fuck about what you do. I wanna be with Rosa, she's my friend and there's nothing a toxic son of a bitch like you can do about it. Stop it, now! Enough! I'm going down there. Is this what you like? Fucking other people's lives? Let me show you how that feels like. Shit. Let it go, motherfucker. You want to fuck my life... see how you like it. Motherfucker! What? Want some more? Is that it? Here! Is this what you want? Fucking clown. Daniel, stop it. What... are you crazy too, like your mother? What is this? Listen, old people die every day. Why doesn't your mother just disappears once and for all? Why doesn't she just dies like your fucking father? What did you say? Say that again! Go away. Get out of my sight, right now. Fucking asshole. Fuck, man... I had my whole life in here. What do I do now? Start over, Job. That's what you do. It's time, it's time for the government to go! It's time, time for the government to go! Mom, you're old enough to know better! Is there an age limit to protest? You'll be arrested one of these days. It wouldn't be the first time. As if that accomplishes anything. It does. And staying home does not accomplishes anything, that's for sure. Things are getting worse and we're all fed up. Finta's mother knows best. You know what she says? That the problem today is that there are more whores than ever and increasingly fewer clients. It's gonna need some work, there's some things that we need to talk about, but the general opinion here at the publishing company is that you have great potential so we're publishing the book. But it's better if you talk to Sara, she's the one responsible for our starting authors in our label and she was the one whose report was more enthusiastic and... since you're gonna work together I might as well introduce you. Sara, can you come to my office? l have Job right here, in the flesh... Yes, Job, that Job. There's not a lot of them, right? Something wrong with the name? Job? No, | just find it curious, I actually think it's great... it makes a great title... "The New Book of Job". l thinkthe idea came from Rosa. That's right. Here's Sara. Sara, this is Job. Maybe you should talk for a while, olC? - Hello, very nice to meet you. - My pleasure. Shall we? - See you soon. - See you soon. I know that I'm new around here but your... Can we be in a first name basis? Of course. Your writing was one of the most honest works that | read since I got here. I would like to talkto you a little bit, know about your process. Today? Yes, | wasjust leaving, so... Wanna see my office? - Your office? - Yes... Why not? How do you work in your office when it rains? I don't know. It never happen so far... What? Nothing. So, how do we do this? - Do what? - The work. Oh, I'm sorry, I had no idea you were up here. This is Sara, from the publisher. l wasjust leaving... She was just leaving... l was just curious about his process. I was assign to... That doesn't matter anyway, I wasjust about to leave... No, nonsense. Why don't you ask your friend to stay for dinner? I don't know... What do you say? Come on, say yes. Then Rosa said something like... How was it, Rosa? That the year was 1984... When General Eanes was in power... Then the guy had to go outside to get the paper, can you imagine, just to prove we were in two thousand thirteen. And Rosa smoking her cigarette, as if it was nothing... See you. Have you ever had a girlfriend? What do I need a girlfriend for? l have you. You're so silly! And that's why stars shine. But stars are also predestined to collapse. The cosmos was originally composed of helium and hydrogen. Other heavier elements were... Our planet, life, Man, is made out of matter from the stars. We are the star's dust... "...it was that same night "that I had one of the strangest dreams that my brain as ever come up with. "Especially considering that I usually dream with boobs. "I dreamt that l was walking down the street, "a street where other people walked by and, all of a sudden, "gravity stopped applying its law "and we all started to float. "But nobody screamed, "some tried to hold on to light posts or to the top ofthe building's windows, "as if the world was upside down, "as if some motherfucker had picked up the Earth and turned it around, "maybe looking for some loose change, a couple of coins and you buy a joint... "And we all floated until we left the planet... "And we all floated until we left the planet, towards space "where our bodies would burn as they passed the stratosphere, "we would all die in flames "and the only question was if you would be alone or if, by mere chance, "you would be able to hold on to another floating body "and embrace it as you went through that journey together." Wait, it's not over. "When I woke up, still half asleep, "I thought by brain was all fucked up and that I needed to stop smoking joints. "And that, if I was lucky, "maybe one day I would find someone who wouldn't mind being on fire with me. "Then, I got up, went to the bathroom, washed my face, " looked in the mirror and knew that that was never gonna happen". l was wrong. You took so long. It was only an instant. An instant without you is eternity. Now you're gonna have to put up with me forever. Do you see how lucky I am? CATS HAVE NO VERTIGO The End
