PRINCESS Enjoy! Get up. One... two... Three. Come on. Adari... I've been trying to wake you since seven. Maybe you're lacking B-12. I'll take you with me to work and get you checked out. Come on. Get up. I'm letting her win. You're so mature for your age. You're so beautiful for yours. Where's my jeans skirt? I hid it from you. Every time you leave the house, I put it on. I swear. I look in the mirror and pretend that I'm you. I ask myself, how's it like to live with such a perfect body? Do you have a pretty mother? Yes. Do I look fat? No. Swear, on your mother's life. I swear. Sexy. You're amazing, Mom. She got three F's. You will have to work very hard. There's no grade in grammar, she doesn't attend classes. Adar. We've reached the stage where the principal is considering expelling her. Very good. She deserves it. It's a pity. Adar is such a talented girl. You don't have to tell me, I know who I'm dealing with. I would do the same if I were you. He'll never kick you out. He feels sorry for you. Thanks to me, young lady. You should thank me. I don't allow it. You really do deserve to be kicked out. What the hell is wrong with you? Why are you so angry? You flirted with him. You're completely crazy. Hi. Hi, cuties. How are you? Lucky it was on my lunch break, I can still stuff something down. Hey, prince. How do you feel? You look pale. -What's that? -Medicine. -Disgusting. -I'm also drinking it. In one shot. One, two, three. I've been thinking of you all day. Did they say you're the smartest boy in class? -No. Then what did they say? Come on. Wait a sec... what are you doing here? My stomach aches. Is it anything you ate? I don't know, it aches. Go back to your bed. I hereby confirm that my daughter, Adar, isn't feeling well, please excuse her absence from school and extracurricular activities. There's an awful stomach virus going around. -When do you go back? -I have a double shift. I'll call to make sure you're asleep. How do you feel, prince? So so. -For how long now? -A while. Let's take a look. Your pulse rate is high. Do you still have difficulty breathing? Have you seen Dr. Freed? And? Did he register you for the experiment? Is it helping? Well, he must have given you the placebos again. You got your period. -You sure? -Two hundred percent. -Are you happy, Adari? -About what? Being a woman. -Could it be something else? -Like what? Not my period. It's definitely your period. Don't tell Michael. Of course not. No way. It's our little secret. Does it hurt, angel? No. I left some money for you. Buy yourself something nice after school. Get yourself a nice blouse, you deserve it. Where are you going? I haven't decided yet. Don't you have school? I don't go to school. I don't either. Only when I feel like it. Where do you live? Nowhere. Where are your parents? I don't know. Don't you care? It's mutual. They don't care about me either. What are you looking for? Just looking. Adar -Adar -Hey. Tell me, have you gone absolutely mad? I didn't notice the time. Where have you been all day? I've been worried sick about you. I was on the way home. Meet Alan. This is my mom. That's Michael, my mom's boyfriend. I'm Alma. Nice to meet you. Mom, can Alan sleep over? Are you a friend of Adari's from school? He'll sleep with me, in my room, it won't disturb you. Where do you live? His dad is supposed to come and get him. He's overseas. It's only for a few days, it'll be okay. Does he agree that you sleep over at strangers? Would you rather he slept in the street? Who's taking care of you? I get by. Do you have a place to sleep tonight? No. Are you awake? Do you need anything? Can you lend me 200 Shekels? Yes. -Don't take more than 50 a day. -Okay. Why aren't you with your dad? Why aren't you with yours? My mother says he's an idiot. Is he? You know what I think? What? That you look like a little monkey. Are you awake? What are you doing? Why didn't you get up? I got fired. What? I don't teach anymore. Why? It doesn't interest me. I hate being a teacher. Have you told Mom? Not yet. Tasty? Come over, boy. Come closer. A bit more. Did you go to school today? -I give up. -What? -I give up. You keep saying "I", but you don't tell me who you are. Make me some food. Don't smile. Your lips are like a baby's. It's cute. Don't smile. I like your expression like that. You've got yellow teeth. It makes you look older. You're beautiful. What can you do? Such a prince. Hey. Look at our gorgeous little girl. I bought her this shirt. It looks lovely on you. Really lovely. Stop. My stomach aches. -Maybe it's gas. -No... -Yes, it is. Stop it, Adar. Get up. Lying in bed all day. At least tidy up your room. You're such a spoiled brat. Adar. Come eat. Adars. Can't you hear me calling you? -Do you want some more? -Yes. -Here you go. -Thanks. Here's to Alan. Cheers. Here's to Adar. -Here's to our new family. -Cheers. Can you pass me the cabbage? Thank you. What do you do all day? I work with Michael. I already know how to stand still for hours. That's no good, it's too hard. I don't find it hard. I want you to get up early with Adar and make sure she goes to school. Okay? Promise? I can come to school early, every day this week at 7:00 in the morning. -You think you'll manage? -Yes. Let's think of how else you can punish me. Why is it so important for you? I'm not retarded. I was in the top class at elementary school. There's no doubt you're talented. But this is a school for the gifted, talent is not enough. I know. What's up with you? Everything's okay. How are things at home? Fine. You sure? Yes. Adar, I feel something is troubling you. I got my period, I guess it's affecting me. You can talk about it with Ronit, the school nurse. She's in her room until one o'clock. Now, run off to class. -Do you like living with us? -Yes. -Do you like Michael? -Yes. What's your dad like? One time, he beat up three men at once. Where is he? -He's busy. He has like 100 workers. Want me to tell you a secret? Whatever. There are many things you don't know about Michael. Like what? He's sterile. So what? So he's not an ordinary man, he has problems. I'm hot. Wanna strip? You're the craziest person in this house. You're sweating. -Do I stink? -No. It's nice. -What did you do, prince? -Nothing. You're lying. -You can tell me. -There's nothing to tell. Did you hold hands? Did you kiss? -Did you kiss with your tongue? -No, disgusting. You're blushing. I'm not blushing. I'm hot. Mom told me you're a real woman now, Is that right? It's none of your business. Are you a real, little woman now? I wonder where he's gone. Want to visit Mom at work? I should be asleep by now. -Are you tired? -A little. -Do you want pancakes? -No. Do you want meat? I'm hungry. It smells like a carcass here. Can you smell it? No. I found this place by chance. It used to be a drive-in. It's crazy. He's your age, do you realize? Let's go. You can look, you can't see anything anyway. What do you say, prince? Where do you want to go? Are you out of your mind? Why did you bring her? She asked me to. She won't be able to get up tomorrow. They'll invite me for another meeting, then kick her out for good. They won't kick her out. She's smarter than all the others. Something's wrong with her. What? She's not right. Are you tired, Adari? I'm also beat. I had a hectic day. What took you so long? A child nearly died in my arms. You think I play games all day? Mom... Why are you just standing here like an idiot? Go to your room, now! You think you'll be able to get up in the morning? I'm sick of you! Maybe I should quit my job and join your little summer camp? It looks like fun. Be our guest. How will you make a living, you idiot? -I'll manage. You think I'm stupid? I'm sorry. What are you doing? I'm stopping the blood with my spit. What happened? I don't remember. I want us to know everything about one another. What do you want to know? Have you ever had sex? Who with? Show me. How does it feel, to have sex? Is everything okay? It's very early. You have to go back to sleep. Your test results are back. I don't care. I spoke with Dr. Freed about your brain structure. Want to hear? No. Aren't you curious about your test results? No. I left the experiment. You can't leave. How are you? I'm fine. And you? You look nice. Why don't you ever call? I'm busy. With school. I have a lot of exams now. Studying hard? That's good. It's important to do well in school. They took your braces off. Did you go to that expensive one? Yes. Well, it looks good. Why are you holding your bag like that? Don't, you'll ruin it. It's okay. It can be fixed. Too bad I don't have my glue with me. -Fix it at home. -Okay. -You're just saying that. -No, I'll fix it. Michael has glue. Fix it. Is Mom still with him? What's he like? Great. You get along with him? Yes. Do you like him? Do you call him Daddy? Of course not. Do you want some avocado? They're in the car, I'll get them. Here. You know how to store avocado? Keep two or three out at a time wrapped in newspaper and the rest in the fridge. You're sweet. Isn't there a parents day or something? I want to come. It's not fair that only your mom goes. I also want to hear about you. -I'll let you know. -Will you call me? You never do. I will. Be a good girl. What are you doing? What are you doing? Where do you hang out all day? Where do you hang out all day? -Nowhere. -What? -Nowhere. Why don't you take me there? Where are you going? Don't go. How long have you been sitting here? I thought you had a lunch break. Have you been here since twelve? We need to talk about Alan. You get me into trouble by coming here, you know? Who does it bother? Me. Why aren't you at school? I don't go to school. -Since when? -Since long ago. I want to work. Really? You're a baby, you can't even get up in the morning. I could model. Michael wants to draw me naked. It's not nude drawings. You're disturbed. Go ahead. The most important part in painting is to observe. Michael. Yes, prince? Can I sleep while you look at me? Sure. Good night. Good night. Michael. You can call me Daddy. Daddy. Yes. Daddy. Adari. -What? -It stinks in here. Your room looks like it belongs to a mental patient. I'm going to throw everything out of the window one day. -Go ahead. -Why do you sleep all day? I heard noises all night, I couldn't sleep. -What noises? -From your bed. It makes a lot of noise. Maybe we should buy you ear plugs. -I have ear plugs. -Did you use them? Didn't you notice I was awake? You usually sleep like the dead. I wish I were dead. Stop it. You're ruining your life. I want you to go to sleep early tonight, and get up tomorrow like a new person, okay? Mom? What? Don't go. Please. Okay. I'll call to say you're sick. Okay? Who's my pretty baby? This is mine. And this is mine. And this is mine. This is mine too. There's nothing you can do about it. You're mine. You're my treasure. Who do you like best out of all the boys in your class? No one. There must be someone cute. There isn't. They're all idiots. They're not idiots, you're just too smart. What do you want to watch? Did you hear about the girl who got pregnant by her father? No. It happened in Denmark. They're crazy there, Adari. You shouldn't watch the news. By the way, they just used the same towel. -That can't be. -That's what they said. -It can't be. -How do you know? I just do. He's not answering me. What did you fight about? I'm glad we get to spend time together, just you and I. Really? Yes. Prince. How do you feel? Okay. Your pulse rate is low today. I'm okay. No, no, don't get up. It's dangerous. You're sick. -I'm healthy. -No, no... don't move. You're still sick. I really love you, kid. Who do you love more? Me or Michael? Where's Michael? Who do you love more? I love you the most. Want to see the most terrible thing in the world? You're scaring me. Come look. Can you breathe well, prince? Stop it. What? I don't want to. You don't want to what? To kiss. This is not kissing. Do you want me to show you what kissing is? I'm willing to show you just once how it's done. You're the most beautiful creature I've ever seen. I'm looking at the most beautiful creature I've ever seen. This is the most beautiful moment of my life, you know? You're freezing. I know you. You'll be alright. Adar. Adar, let me in. Adar. Cut it out, let me in. How did it come out? Disgusting. So don't eat it. It's really disgusting. You're the most disgusting family I've ever met. -Shut up. Don't choke on your food. Stop it! I want to talk to you. Don't come near me, you pervert. Come home. Maybe you interpreted things differently. Whore! You've gone completely mad. It's your fault. My fault? I'm to blame for those filthy games you play with Michael? Michael is my boyfriend. He's my boyfriend, do you understand? You're so stupid. Don't talk to me like that, you little squirt, I'm your mother. You will respect me. You're a whore. Do you have money? You know where the cafeteria is, it's near the gymnasium. Call me, tell me how it went. Okay. -You know how to find your classroom? -Mom, I'll manage. Bye. Goodbye. Goodbye.
