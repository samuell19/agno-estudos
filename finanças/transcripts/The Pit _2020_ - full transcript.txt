You are sick ? Hurry up ! We have to go ! Robert, how nice of you that you came! Otherwise, we would be late! Robert, you could come and help us? What do you say ? - How can I help you ? - In the choir, sing. Our bass is he is having a hard time. Isn't Dad enough for you? We need more men. And you have a voice so beautiful... 2. 3 00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,080 In a month, we have a contest. I've never heard of Robert singing without being drunk. Me neither. You know, singing to me it makes me happier. Now you speak like a preacher. Not true. It's really true. That's why he likes it so much to my father to go to the choir? Yes, that's why I go to the choir. Smaida? You don't intend to to grow your family? I have nothing against. Isn't that right, Smaida? It will come with time. You're not that young anymore. I'm still quite young. And Smaida doesn't seem to he is more than 20 years old. It is not like that ? MÃ©aris made Markus when he was 23 years old. So what ? "I suppose he's in a little hurry." - Is that so... We are not in a hurry, Isn't that right, Smaida? Smaida? Thanks, Robert! Markus, move! Brother ! Stay like that! The sopranos do not squeak! Keep your mouth open and sing so that the sounds circulate. Otherwise, it sounds like as if you were strangled. Here, like that! To be flexible to open. Christ! My dear girls, I would be very grateful if you could discuss the issues your personal after rehearsals. So let's try again! Has anyone seen my Emily? Has anyone seen my Emily? Markus, do you know where he is? Sandra, we're downtown cultural, not kindergarten. "I apologize for the inconvenience." Let's try again! Damn it ! wood the fire will get wet. Hopefully some will dry out as well tomorrow morning we put them in the warehouse. "Where do you think you're going?" - Must go. Right now ? At night, when It's raining ? He can wait. - Must go. - You're not going anywhere. Stay here ! You're not going anywhere. Wash plate and go to bed! You bastard! Don't try to hide pretend you weren't there! What happened ?

I do not want to think what ... Who ? Emily! - Emily? - There, in that pit. - What pit? - God, does it really matter? Sandra, calm down! Come over ! Sit down, darling! Sit down and tell me everything! Take it from the beginning! The dog found her Emily in a pit? It's awful. Is she feeling well? I worried a thousand times, thinking about what might have happened to him in that forest, in this rain, in the dark... In a place where ... It's awful, but why do you think that Is Markus involved in this? Are you asking me for evidence? Emily told us what happened. It's not possible ! Markus he couldn't do that. You're so blind so you don't see who he is? To plan something awful, this is the work of a maniac, not a ten-year-old boy. He's not a maniac. As it grows, the more misaligned he will become. Sandra, listen to what he says! Don't overestimate yourself! - Raising a child is difficult. - What do you want to say ? That you won't be able to control him. I could tell you exactly When did you bring him here? Sandra, how dare you? You break into my house and You offend me. How dare you? Know something ? I think I should have to go straight to the police. You would have seen then! Markus! What happened there ? I ask you one more time. What did you do to Emily? - That was right. - What exactly was right? - That was right. - What the hell was right? You realize that girl could he die? I'll have a thousand head problems. I hate this place! I do not want to stay here! And they don't belong to you! What you said ? Don't you belong to me? Anything that seemed "right" to you will it had consequences for me as well. How will people look at me? I have to live here, baby! I don't want people like Sandra to rush in here, to set me up. Because you have nothing else to committed, you have practically committed a crime. You have nothing to feel guilty, honey. Yes. All Maris' problems they started when she left. So don't ... Don't torture yourself don't blame yourself. I knew that would happen! The children do not listen never parents. Maris is in a better place. What are you talking about? No one came back, to tell us how it was. Grandpa! I Forgot My Phone ! It's okay, Markus! We will not return now out of the way ... - Grandpa, please! - It'll be fine, Markus. We will find a solution. Good morning, Robert! I woke you up ? "Get up!" - I wasn't sleeping. No, I was talking to the boy. You could take it ... You can take it the boy at the mechanic's shop? What should a child do there? Only until September. There must be something to do for him. It will be easier for me too. Well, I think it would he could learn something practical. A real man's job? Good. Tomorrow is good ? If he's not here by eight, he will have to walk. Thanks ! Thanks ! You're going to Robert's tomorrow. What am I going to do there? You will help, you will work. You could learn something useful. I have to draw. You'll draw later. I don't want to go to Robert. I'm not asking you what you want. Today you will help firewood storage. Now, eat! Get us some milk when you're done. What are you doing ? I have a new cell phone. What were you doing ? If you cut your tips eyelashes, will grow longer. - Seriously ? - I saw a video on YouTube. Did Richy find you? Yes. My mother told me no more I'm allowed to talk to you. Yes ? Give me my phone back! Give me the phone, it's new! Give me my phone back! Help me, Markus! Help me get out of here! Emily! Emily! Do you like my secret? Please help me ! It won't be that easy. We'll do a count. If I go out, I'll help you. If you go out, you will have to to handle yourself. The wolf sits on the mattress and commands her coffee, the coffee is bitter, you go out! I will be leaving. - Please, Markus! - A promise is a promise. Markus, please! Markus, help me! Please, Markus, help me! You! Go away immediately! You heard me ? - My little girl ! - Mommy, my phone! Emmy, take care of the phone. I'm not buying you another one. Don't come back here, you bastard! Look at that idiot! Let's go ! Let's go ! What is it ? You're afraid ? Did you do it yourself? You were brave when you pushed her my sister in that pit, right? I will kill you ! Don't miss it, you bastard! Couldn't you run? Damn thieves! two hundred 00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,960 Next time I see you again, I shoot you! I was hoping to store it myself. That's why it took so long. Come here ! Come here ! Did you put the milk in the fridge? Markus! I should have a bandage elastic somewhere. Search the box on the shelf. To stay ? No, that's gauze. Search for a yellow elastic bandage. Bring me the box! I found him. Maybe you should to go to the doctor. God, how it happened to stay ? It fell like a rock. Dear good ! You have to I'm taking the sailor's medicine. I can take it to him. All right, very good. I'll draw you a map. Give me a pen! And that envelope! I had to go since yesterday. I forgot. Get your bike and go to the center, cross the bridge, then turn right. Go straight ahead about 100 meters, then turn left. I'm not going. Here you go ? "I'll take care of the wood." - Later. The sailor could die. Bring me the phone! Yes. I called to tell you he's coming today let the boy bring you the medicine. - What boy ? - Markus. My nephew. Leave the package next to the barrel next to the door. That's all. So you are Solveiga's nephew. I'm not a thief. Me I was hiding from Kristians. - Is that so ? - Yes, the boys wanted to kill me. - I found a bicycle in the woods. - It is mine. You can go in warehouse, take it. Why are you rummaging around? Vanckars. "Vanckars"? A chicken embryo. The hen did not finish hatching. It still happens sometimes. It's weird to see a window colored in a warehouse. They are usually put in churches and castles. And a gift. wanted to give it to someone. A gift ? How you give to someone a window with a stained glass window? Some gifts do not have intended to be placed on a shelf. If you finished it, you would have that most beautiful warehouse in Latvia. Maybe even from all over the world. I spilled some colors on the drawing. The one you were copying? - Yes. - I can redo the drawing. Forget it ! Go home ! I can draw it for you, and you can finish the warehouse. Can you show me the drawing? Please ! Can't you ignore it? Good ! Forget it ! It is not in vain! Well ? Did I satisfy your curiosity? Maris Katlapkalns. "Did my father draw this?" - Yes. It was a little bigger than you are now. He was 17 or 18 years old. I'll do it for you. Yes, OK. I doubt you're drawing as good as you say. You do not believe me ? I took first prize of all drawing competitions at my school. - They even put me on TV, on the news! - Congratulations ! Now go home! What is this ? You're good. My dream is to become a world-renowned artist and make a lot of money. It's a good plan. I'll draw that sketch. What did you do to that girl? Who told you about it? My rooster tells me the news local every morning. It was her fault. Eye for an eye. It's bad. And you ? You don't have to hate otherwise, there will be no room for good. And space is limited. And you said you had one weapon and that you will shoot me. That's my tactic to scare thieves. She is ? She's beautiful, isn't she? But ... So big ... We will need it a lot of paper. Well... I have paper. I'll draw it. Grandma, I befriended The sailor. It's not that scary! Why did you stay so long? He has a large warehouse and a a window that is not really a window. You had to leave the package and come at home, not to walk through the warehouses. - Grandpa! - Go to eat ! I do not want to eat. Could you... What ? Can you give me some white sheets? Look on the shelf! It's an empty notebook on a stack of books. Grandma, why are you taking them? Sailor those packages? Eat at least a little and go to put the wood in the warehouse! What are you waiting for, valet? - Did you learn the way here? - Yes. Then you come alone tomorrow. Howdy ! What do we have here ? A new employee? Alexander. What is this, a dead fish? One more time ! What's your name ? - Markus. - Markus. - Are you on a trip? - No, I came to help. To help? Finally, we someone helps us too! We can barely handle ourselves. Sashka, did you introduce yourself? Yes. Let's get to work! Come on! Okay, take a look here! Solveiga's ideas. The kid? Yes. It's my cousin's. The artist ? How sad ! Kid! Get the tires those and bring them here! I'll get them out of here later. Where should I take them? Here you go ? Where should I take them? "Where"? You have a brain, don't you? I told you I'd take them. Look ! Come here ! Look at this ! Kid! Bring me the ratchet! What is a ratchet? A ratchet, I said. Get me a ratchet! Jesus, the boy it's no good! Go get it! Do you have any pills? You're a hangover, aren't you? - The little one... - Give it to me! ... kept me awake all night. You'll understand when you will have children too. I do not think. Listen ! I know a guy in Riga. Like you, yes still tormented, then, boom! He used a test tube, and everything worked out. Stop making fun of me! Get to work! It's cheaper to take another wife, right? Kid! - Do you know what a box is? - A box ? Do you even know what a box is? - Yes I know. "Bring me the one from my car!" Great, isn't it? I hope so to gather them until tonight. Otherwise, you'll sleep here. Just like that girl of yours. Robert said that I'm not good at anything. It's nothing it was just the first day. Can I go to Mariner tomorrow? Did you lose anything there? You're going to Robert. I told you that I don't like Robert. So we have a prince among us! All you do is complain. Bring me some caps! I don't see why we have to take the boy. Peter brought mine these from Belgium. They are delicious ! Sandra, you shouldn't to bother. Thanks ! Irena, this place was always quiet. It is not like that ? I don't want it to happen anymore something like that happens. You have girls too. Don't say that. I can recommend the intervention of a psychologist. For whom ? For me ? I do not need something like this. I meant your daughter. Emily is fine. Know how is it today you get them a new phone, and the problem disappears. I think this one it's just the begining, knowing his parents. Maybe Emily it somehow provoked him. Not. Emily didn't do anything wrong. But there must be a reason. Do you know what my problem is? Are agitated because I saw his drawings. One look, and I gave up figure out what's on that boy's mind. He's mentally ill. What drawings? He forgot his drawings home with us. You know very well that many children do expresses through drawings. You're kidding ? We need a better reason than some drawings. Irena, I'm clear proof of his mental instability. Yes but... I'm not an expert on this subject. Yeah, well, I will I'm talking to Krista. But you have the authority to start procedures, not me. And neither does she. Well ... I think so. Emily will surely bear it the consequences of this trauma. I'm very sure of that. When he grows up ... I don't want to be the mother who says: "I'm sorry, honey, I don't there was nothing I could do to protect you. " Do not Cry ! Everything will be fine. I'll think about it everything is legal and justified. Good ? Yes. This place looks close like a church now. See ? I drew. Good ! So father, so son. While I was cleaning, I found some useful things. I had some guests. Mice. Damn it ! Can we work on stained glass today? To be honest, the kids didn't should work with glass. I'll be careful. "You could cut your fingers!" - That won't happen. Good. But don't blame him me if you cut a finger. Good. Let's jump in! Put the sketch on the sheet of paper and write down each piece in order. It was funny what you said. What ? "Let's jump into the water." It helps me adjust. Have you ever been to the sea? As soon as I stepped on the deck, I I started feeding the fish. It's a great nickname, but of course you also have a normal name. My normal name is ... ... Juris. This is ! You are completely alone here. And you're alone here. Yes, I have no friends here. I had a few in Riga. Here I prefer to draw. So you draw them your friends? Yes, but if I want to I'm talking to someone, I ... - Do not tell anyone ! - Good. - And don't laugh at me. - OK ! I am talking to myself. In this case, we are alike. I speak alone too. Of all those with which I concerted, no one looks the same smart or sensitive like me. Come on, Kristine, apologize! If she didn't learn, at her age Well, what can you expect from the boy? Yes. Nobody cares, for that it does not affect their families. - Honey, your throat is going to hurt! - Nay ! Good ! I don't think he realized it why is that boy capable. Of course, I will. My father was your assistant, and now me too I'm your assistant. I was an assistant too. Once, I met one glazed and I became his assistant. You can only learn by performing. Sailor, who followed to give him this stained glass? You told grandma that you come here? Lies cause a lot problems in this world. Did you know? Yes I know. You kept the bottle since then? Yes. I have enough for all colors. But... But... I don't have red anymore. This is the last song. Markus, take it to Albert some tomatoes, please! He didn't fix it. Not. - Albert! - What is it ? I'm tired of this drunkenness. - Is sleeping ? - Of course. I'm going to get water. Good morning ! Do you want to have dinner? Damn it ! What are you doing ? - What the hell... - I'll wipe you. You're going to wipe me out! Not could you be more careful? But, Robert ... And what else is that? Must to eat yesterday's leftovers? - What's in the soup? - "What's with the soup?" I work hard in each day, and you can't cook like the world? I can fry you something. Albert will ... Yes, of course, Albert! What to start ? You you have problems ? Female dog ! You are made one for the other? - What should I finish? What is the problem ? - I `m tired of this ! - Are you tired? Why are you tired? - Shut up ! What will you do ? I will Are you biting me like a bitch? What are you doing ? I will not tolerate this something in my house. Your home ? Yes, get out of here! Are you ok ? Listen, Daddy! This is my house too, Yes ? And that's my wife. So go to hell! You understand ? You bastards! You sleep a lot. I'll be done soon. You show me how to do I insert the veins? Lead veins. Be careful to wash on his hands afterwards. Lead is toxic. Good. Let's go ! I didn't think you were alive today. If no one is through around, do you sleep all the time? No, I'm not feeling well today. Why does he bring you Grandma those packages? Because I can't I'm going downtown alone. You are sick ? Yes I have diabetes. Because of the sugar. This is. So? Now, give it a try! So... Your life is sad. Nobody comes to visit you. Not. I have a good life. What's so bad? You came. And I'm happy. That's right! It's your turn. A knife that cuts lead. It's for you. Like when you're going to be a master of stained glass to remember me. Thanks ! Finally, you came home! I have to go to Riga. You'll have to stay with Albert. You can go to the workshop with Robert, tomorrow morning. Can't I stay here? I don't want to go to Albert. You complain all the time. When are you going to do what you're told? - Robert ... - What about Robert? Robert beats Smaida. What are you talking about? What nonsense! Don't forget your toothbrush. - I want to stay home! - Let's go ! Albert is already waiting for you. A to feed you a bed. I'll be back tomorrow afternoon. But I don't want to go to Albert! What are you going to do in Riga? I have to take care of the paperwork and a few other issues. Ivars takes me with car. Let's go ! Let's go ! Ivars, give me a minute! Hurry up ! Faster ! Albert! Goodbye, I'm gone! Dear good ! Everything will be fine. Maybe we should have ... I'm going to kill him! Good morning, Markus! Do you want some eggs? - How did you sleep? - Good. - Where's Smaida? - She's sleeping, she's not feeling well. Yes ? Hello friend ! Nobody taught you to do you greet the elderly? What are you doing here ? Solveiga went to Riga. I understand. Where's the lighter? I don't know, I'm looking for her beyond! Boy, bring me the lighter! I told you to bring me the lighter! "Why doesn't she sleep in her bed?" - She is sick. Is that so ? Is that what they say now? "Maybe she shouldn't be with him." - No, let him listen! That's real life, it's not like in the movies. Markus, get out! No, Markus, stay here! Stay here, Markus! We'll have one discussion as from man to man. Robert, calm down, please! There is nothing to see there! Me? Calm down? What is Daddy? Do you feel young again? Robert, stop it! She's afraid of you. Is he afraid of me? But of you, right? Don't you want to stop? You've been a good boy for a long time time. You make me sick! - Stop yelling ! - Everyone was laughing at you. You were so stupid you couldn't see how your mother plays on your fingers. - Remain silent ! - You don't think I saw that? I knew what was going on. Robert, what happened between me and your mother don't look at you. Good morning, Markus! Are you leaving already? - You lied to me. - Here you go ? You're not a Juris, you're a lady. This was ! How can I explain? We all have secrets. I have too. As, I suppose, you have. Where is your secret place? Keep up, don't be left behind! I told you to go faster! Do you like my secret? Stop it, Markus! Help me get out of here! Not. It won't be that easy. We'll do a count. If I go out, I will help you. If you go out, you will have to you can handle yourself. The wolf sits on the mattress and commands her coffee, the coffee is bitter, you go out! Well... - I will be leaving. - No, Markus! Wait ! Markus! A promise is a promise. Please, Markus, help me! After all, you didn't leave. I wanted to finish the stained glass. And see what it looks like. And I. Which are you ? I was always the ... angry boy. I was fighting with everyone. God forgive me. Is she my grandmother? I was in the same class. I just don't have it finished that school. You were an ordinary girl. Back then, girls they were not wearing pants. It's not like now. But I liked it. I was putting on some pants, I was putting some rags on my prohab and I was looking in the mirror when my mother was not at home. I wouldn't be either he wanted me to be a girl. Let's go ! Sailor, mother has yours ever caught you God, no! She was very ... He didn't like anything from what I liked. I didn't like it. Markus! I wanted to tell you something. Thanks for coming here. Finally, I can finish this damn gift. You scared me ! Are you still here? Yes, another 15 minutes. It takes a while. Okay, I don't have time to wait, I'll leave the keys in the mailbox. Sveta! Sveta, wait! I need to talk to you. Do you want to sell the apartment? Not. I'll rent it. You rent it. Can you take the boy with you? Dear Solveiga, how many times Can I tell you it's not possible? She needs her mother his. A child is a treasure. When I had Maris ... I've wanted to tell you this for a long time time. When this boy came, I didn't need such a treasure! How can you say that? I can tell. I naively hoped Maris would will mature after the birth of the child, but he was not interested in anything else than to paint that nonsense. Stop blaming others, okay? You can keep it this didactic tone for your school. I'm not a baby, in case you haven't noticed. Is enough ! It broke. We'll find another piece of red. Do not worry. - Are I leaving already? - Yes. - What happened ? - You do not know ? Women's issues. It will be well. Markus, where have you been ? I was riding my bike. Stop lying. Good ? I managed to talk to Robert and he told me he had never seen you before. Not today, not yet yesterday, not the day before yesterday. I told you not to likes Robert's house. You know what ? Give me the bike! Go home ! Right now ! I'll be back in half an hour. Howdy ! We're going to break your legs! Fool, what did you do to my sister? Don't miss it! Pick it up ! "Get up!" - Where are you going ? "Leave me alone, bag of bacon!" - I'm a bag of bacon, right? Carrot head carrot! You hit me, retard! It hurts, doesn't it? Hit him! Leave here ! Do you want to kill him? Some heroes, two against one. Are you ok ? Are you hurt? Hold this ! Why, at the first difficulties, I'm starting to punch! You are more smart, isn't it? Uncle Albert, Smaida and the hospital? Yes. When will he return? Go from there ! Solveiga! You are ! Markus kept coming here without my permission and I didn't even know. - I'm glad to see you ! Take a seat ! - I'm waiting for an explanation. But why can't he come here? I have nothing to give you explanations. Did we get along? You keep him on a leash like a puppy. Here you go ? In the end, it will run away, just like Maris. Here you go ? After all I have made for you ... Do you have the guts to tell me that? I'll tell you what I think. I'm glad you came to talk, otherwise, I'm just talking to your bags. Do not mock me ! I didn't come here to you I hear clever remarks. Why don't you take a seat? The boy lied. All time. And you support him. I think you're exagerating. I came to tell you to stay away from me and Markus. That's what I did. A long time. I have stay away from everyone. You have to thank you for this. Are you blaming me? How dare you to say something like that? Sorry, he got out of me simply like a wind. I was just a child, I was 18 years old. You don't know what I went through. - The way people looked at me ... - It's no surprise. You were very beautiful. You don't know how I felt. It went well for me. They put in a psychiatric asylum. I did not know. Nobody said nothing. The Soviet was ... I was shocked. Then, when you told me it was a relief. I could, in finally, to be a boy. Well, after my mother died. But it doesn't matter now. Everything disappeared like a dream. In fact, like a nightmare. Let me show you the stained glass which I did with Markus! We still miss him a piece of glass. What stained glass? What the glass? You have gone crazy ? - Did you at least hear what I said? - Sure you do. Markus can't anymore come here. You understand ? You can get in That bottle around your neck! Six, seven, eight. See ? This is you. Everyone is against it your. Grandma, Kristians, Renars. Hello ! Markus, come here! Wait for me in the suit booth, Yes ? Until the rehearsals are over. So let's get started, come on!

We have the red bottle, but you sleep. Hey! - Come here ! - Hi ! - What do you have there ? "I brought you these drawings." Look! You can do something with them, right? Yes. Hi, Sandra! Are you organizing an exhibition? Hello! It's interesting. It's scary. It is not like that ? Solveiga's nephew. Little Markus? He looks very talented. It's not about talent here. These are the signs of some serious mental problems. It is not like that ? Look at this, it's pure violence! That's in his mind. Have you seen my father? Hi, Robert! What are you doing here ? Have you decided to join us? - He's still in the room. - In the hall. What are you doing here ? We need to talk. You are listening to me ? I'm talking to you. What happened ? You tell me!

I'm asking you. What happened ? - She left. - Where? Where did he go ? He's not coming back, after everything you've done to them. So it's my fault again? Tell me, what did I do? Good evening, Robert! Hello ! My name and Solveiga Katlapkalns. I'll call you from the center community Birga. - We have a man ... a dead person. - I think it's pretty clear. The drawings are fragmentary, strange. A hidden violence. Look at these teeth ... Every artist has his own style. In that logic, everyone artists are psychopaths. Evija, we're talking about a child. Be grateful you didn't gone through what I went through. I wouldn't want anyone like that. May ? Can you do you write your expert opinion? Yes of course. Okay, I'm waiting for the materials. Good luck ! Goodbye ! - Where are you going, Daddy? - At work, Emmy. Can I come with you ? Kristians is the boss. When does my mother return? Soon ! Richy, you're a great dog! Is Kristian home? I'm calling him. Kristy, Renars is here. Kristy! Can I come with you ? Not. Stay home until my mother comes. Play with Markus! Markus is boring. Hi ! Why do you draw all the time? Because I like it. Let's play school! No, if you were hiding! I do not want. Who taught you to draw? My father. Is your father an artist? Yes. Maris Katlapkalns. He has the same initials as me. What are those "initials"? Initials. The first letters. "And where is he now?" - Who? Your father. That's not important. Tell me! What do you keep a secret? You're going to get old fast, if you ask so many questions. Give it back to me! - I do not want. "Give it back to me!" I do not want. Give it back to me! I do not want. I know everything. Your mother doesn't want you either your father was a drug addict. And now he's dead. - You're stupid, you don't understand anything. - Yes, I understand! Nay ! Give me the drawing back! Do you want me to show you my secret? Yes. Let's run! Give them back to me, they're mine! Here he is, the artist! Ladies, what's going on here? Maybe you don't like how I draw, but the sailor likes it. - What sailor? - Solveiga leaves him to that inverted. - The sailor is a ... - She's a woman. Know something ? Shut up ! You had to be careful when you raised a drug addict! My father was not a drugged. And you don't understand anything! - What are you doing... - Solveiga, hold your boy! Calm down, boy! Robert, what are you doing? Are you hurt? Get up! Did you get hurt? Markus! Everything will be fine. Everything will be fine. Everything will be fine. Know... The Sailor and I have were childhood friends. Yes, I know, Grandma. Yes. He told me everything. That she's a woman. Here's a hole! I ruined everything. He didn't finish school in my cause then got sick. I wanted to help him somehow. He didn't need the packages those, he needed a friend. He was very lonely. Know. He really wanted to finish the stained glass. But we... I broke the red bottle. It's good that you became friends. - Grandpa! - What is it ? Will be fine ! It will be fine, baby! Will be fine !
