CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY WARNER BROS. [MAN SHOUTING IN SPANISH] HYAH! [WHISTLES] HYAH! HYAH! HYUP! TWISTED BRONC. LIKE TO BREAK MY BACK FALLING OVER ON ME. I KNOW THAT COLT. HIS DADDY WAS A PURE OUTLAW, TOO. [NEIGHING] THEY'RE SPOOKED TONIGHT. WHY DO I ALWAYS DRAW A NIGHT HAWK WHEN THERE'S A FULL MOON? [GUNS COCK] Man: YOU SHOOT EVERY STRANGER IN TEXAS, YOU'RE GONNA BE MORE FAMOUS THAN QUANTRELL HIMSELF. YOU LOOK LIKE YOU SEEN A GHOST, REAL. YOUR WIFE GOT A LETTER SAYING YOU DIED. IT WAS SIGNED BY THE GREAT GENERAL BEDFORD FORREST HIMSELF. WORD WAS THAT YOU DIED A HERO FOR THE CONFEDERACY. WELL, TRUTH BE KNOWN, I GOT SHOT IN THE BUTT. AND I DON'T REMEMBER FEELIN' HEROIC, GENERAL FORREST OR NOT. IS THE WAR OVER? FOR ME, IT IS. YOU HUNGRY? HOW IS SHE? SEEING YOU IS GOING TO SHAKE HER. YOU WANT ME TO SADDLE A MUSTANG? THIS HORSE AND I COME A LONG WAY TOGETHER. [RINGING] RACE YOU! BYE. SEE YOU TOMORROW. SEE YOU TOMORROW! HURRY! CLARE, DAVIS! WAIT A MINUTE. Child: RACE YOU! WHERE ARE Y'ALL GOING SO FAST? WE HAVE TO GO SAY GOOD-BYE TO SANDERS. WELL, THAT'S ALL RIGHT, BUT AFTERWARDS GET YOUR CHORES DONE. YES, MAMA. YES, MAMA. CLARE? AFTER CHORES, HELP DAVIS WITH HIS ARITHMETIC. I WILL, MAMA. FELT NAKED WITHOUT MY COLT. THAT'S WHAT BRITCHES ARE FOR. DON'T LISTEN TO HIM. HE'S A MEAN OLD MAN. WE ALTERED THE HAMMER AND THE CYLINDER, AND WE INSTALLED A SIDE EJECTOR ROD TO PUNCH OUT THE EMPTY SHELLS. DOESN'T FEEL MUCH DIFFERENT. MIGHT NOT FEEL MUCH DIFFERENT, BUT THAT CONVERTED COLT IS NOW A CUSTOM-MADE, PRECISION FIREARM. NOT THAT YOU KNOW HOW TO USE IT. YES, SIR. THOSE BOYS ARE GONNA WANT TO PLAY POKER WITH YOU. NO, MA'AM. THIS GUN STAYS RIGHT WHERE IT IS. [CHILDREN TALKING] HAVE THEM LEARN THEIR SUMS. HAVE HIM PRACTICE HIS PENMANSHIP AFTER CHORES. SARAH, WILL YOU GET MY CHILDREN? WELL, I'LL BOW. YES, THERE'S A GOD IN HEAVEN. HELLO, JAMES. I'M GLAD YOU'RE BACK. THIS IS YOUR FATHER. NO, HE'S NOT. CABLE'S DEAD. YOU SAID SO. I WAS WRONG. YOU'RE A BIG BOY. WOULDN'T HAVE KNOWN YOU, EITHER. DADDY. HELLO, CLARE. AHH. LOOK AT YOU. OHH. WHERE'S THE BABY? [FIGHTING TEARS] MARY DIED. ALMOST 3 YEARS AGO OF INFLUENZA. THERE WAS NOTHIN' ANYBODY COULD'VE DONE. 2 DAYS AFTER SHE COME DOWN WITH IT, SHE WAS GONE. 3 YEARS AGO? I WROTE YOU... HALF A DOZEN LETTERS. OHH. Clare: "THERE ARE OLD SOLDIERS, "AND THERE ARE EAGER SOLDIERS, "BUT REGRETFULLY THERE ARE VERY FEW OLD, EAGER SOLDIERS." WERE YOU EAGER? CLARE SAYS YOU FOUGHT NORTHERN OPPRESSION. I FOUGHT TO STAY ALIVE, SON. ASK HIM WHY A GROWN MAN WITH 3 CHILDREN WOULD VOLUNTEER IN THE FIRST PLACE. THAT'S LIKE ASKING A MAN WHY HE'S SHORT OR TALL. HE JUST IS, THAT'S ALL. MOM USED TO SAY THAT THE GREATEST UNANSWERED QUESTION OF OUR TIME WAS WHY YOU VOLUNTEERED FOR THE CONFEDERATE ARMY. YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO GO. OUT OF THE MOUTHS OF BABES. AND WE ALL KNOW WHO PUT THOSE WORDS IN HIS MOUTH. HE ENLISTED BECAUSE GENERAL FORREST PERSONALLY SENT HIM A COMMISSION, BUT YOUR FATHER TRAINED THE HORSES FOR GENERAL FORREST'S GLORIOUS NINTH CAVALRY-- LET'S NOT TALK ABOUT THE GREAT GENERAL FORREST. WELL, HE'S THE GREATEST HORSE GENERAL THAT EVER LIVED. MAN GOES TO WAR WHEN HIS COUNTRY CALLS. Mrs. Cable: CABLE WENT TO WAR TO GET AWAY FROM US. HE WENT TO WAR FOR GOD AND COUNTRY AND HORSEFLESH. HE THOUGHT IT'D BE A GREAT ADVENTURE. SINCE I'M NOT DEAD, IT IS NO LONGER NECESSARY TO TALK ABOUT ME AS IF I WAS. ANYWAY WE'RE GONNA WIN, 'CAUSE GOD'S ON OUR SIDE. I DON'T KNOW WHERE GOD STANDS, SON, BUT THE WAR IS LOST. THAT'S ENOUGH TALK ABOUT THE WAR FOR ONE NIGHT. LET'S GET TO BED. WELL, SEE YOU IN THE MORNIN'. GOOD NIGHT. GOOD NIGHT. [DOOR CLOSES] James: WELL, THAT WAS AN INTERESTING EVENING. MY DAUGHTER'S ALWAYS HAD A PRICKLY DISPOSITION. YOU KNOW, TOO MUCH EDUCATION'S A TERRIBLE THING FOR A WOMAN. JAMES SANFORD, I MISSED YOU. WELCOME HOME, SON. [GUN COCKS] WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO NOW? WELL, MUST BE 20,000 HEAD OF CATTLE ALL OVER THE SOUTH OF TEXAS. REAL WANTS ME TO HELP DRIVE THEM TO ABILENE. IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT TO DO? WE NEED THE MONEY. YOUR FATHER'S A REAL ARTIST. I DID IT, IF YOU WANT TO KNOW. YOU DIDN'T ANSWER MY QUESTION. I WANT TO GO HOME. IT'S WHAT I DREAMED OF. THIS IS THE MONEY WE GOT FOR OUR COWS WHEN WE LEFT ARIZONA. IT IS. YOU NEVER TOUCHED IT? NO. [SIGHS] WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO? EVERY DAY, I GOT UP AT SUNRISE. EVERY DAY, I TAUGHT SCHOOL, I CAME HOME, I COOKED DINNER, I READ TO THE CHILDREN, I WENT TO BED, AND I WAITED FOR YOU TO COME BACK AND TAKE ME HOME. [ROOSTER CROWS] PUT THIS HORSE TO WORK, A COUPLE OF YEARS, YOU'LL HAVE A GREAT STABLE. MUCH OBLIGED, JAMES. ARIZONA TERRITORY IS STILL UNION. BUT WITH YOUR EYE, THIS IS GOOD AT 1,000 YARDS. THE WAR'S BEHIND US, OR SO I THOUGHT. CLARE, WE'RE MOVIN' OUT. WILL YOU COME VISIT US IN ARIZONA? DAUGHTER, YOU KNOW I'LL NEVER LEAVE TEXAS. WHAT'S THE MATTER? WE'VE BEEN TALKIN'. IT'S SUNDAY. WE WANT TO STOP. I FIGURE 3 MORE HOURS, THEN WE'LL STOP. Mrs. Cable: HYAH! HYAH! Cable: GO! GIDDAP! HYAH! GIDDAP! THAT'S IT, CLARE. GIDDAP. Cable: YEE-HAW! Davis: WHAT'S WRONG WITH DADDY, MAMA? HYAH! IT'S NOTHING AT ALL, DAVIS. SEE THOSE MOUNTAINS UP THERE? WHEN WE CLEAR 'EM, WE'RE GONNA BE IN ARIZONA TERRITORY. GIDDAP! WE'RE ALMOST HOME. Y'ALL HUSH AND GET TO SLEEP. [THUNDER] I'M SO EXCITED ABOUT GETTIN' HOME. THERE WERE TIMES, EVEN ON THE BATTLEFIELD, I USED TO THINK ABOUT MARY. TRIED TO IMAGINE WHAT SHE LOOKED LIKE. SAW HER WHEN SHE WAS 2. SAW HER ON HER THIRD BIRTHDAY, WHEN SHE WAS 4. [THUNDER] BARELY LIVED PAST ONE. [RUMBLING] Cable: STAMPEDE. COME ON, DAVIS. COME ON. [WHINNYING] EVERYBODY ALL RIGHT? I THINK SO. Woman: WHOA! THEY PLOWED THROUGH HERE. STAY BACK. DIDN'T EXPECT ANYBODY'D BE UP THIS HIGH. WE HAD A FIRE. WE COULDN'T HAVE STOPPED 'EM ANYWAY. THE LIGHTNING SPOOKED 'EM. YOU HAD NO RIGHT DRIVIN' HORSES AT NIGHT IN A THUNDERSTORM. ANY FOOL KNOWS THAT. AUSTIN, GO GET VERN AND MY FATHER. JOE, BEN, GET THE WAGON UP. MOST FOLKS USE THE WAGON TRAIL DOWN BELOW. WE FIGURED IT'D BE SAFER UP HERE. WHAT'S YOUR NAME? CABLE. WHAT'S YOURS? KEEP QUIET. LORRAINE KIDSTON'S MY NAME. WHERE YOU FOLKS HEADED? DIDN'T SAY. HYAH! HYAH! MOVE! SHE'S FROM PHILADELPHIA. I DON'T EXPECT HER TO KNOW ANYTHING, BUT YOU BOYS, RUNNIN' HORSES DOWN A MOUNTAIN IN THE DARK IN A STORM? MAMA TOLD 'EM THAT. [CHUCKLES] I'LL BET SHE DID. WHAT DID YOU SAY YOUR NAME WAS? DIDN'T SAY. HIS NAME'S CABLE. THE GIRL SAID SO. THEY SAID YOU WERE DEAD. WISHFUL THINKIN' FOR SOME. YOU RODE WITH THAT MURDEROUS SON OF A BITCH NATHAN BEDFORD FORREST. AFTER THE WAR, WE'RE GONNA HANG HIM. YOU'RE GONNA NEED A LONG ROPE. WE COULD SHOOT YOU RIGHT HERE. PROBABLY GET A MEDAL FOR IT. BUNCH OF YANKEES MURDERING ONE MAN, HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN? DO THEY GIVE MEDALS FOR THAT IN YOUR ARMY? MA'AM... YOUR HOME HAS BEEN CONFISCATED BY THE UNION ARMY. THAT'S STEALIN'! CLARE. ARIZONA NEVER WAS A SLAVE TERRITORY. DIDN'T FIGHT FOR SLAVERY. WHAT THE HELL DID YOU FIGHT FOR? WHEN YOU BETRAYED THE UNION, CABLE, YOU GAVE UP YOUR RIGHTS. MAYBE YOU FOLKS SHOULD MOVE ON. SAVE A LOT OF HEARTBREAK. NOBODY'S DRIVIN' US OFF OUR LAND. YOU FIGURE YOU CAN DROP US ALL? YOU'RE FIRST. HE'S NEXT. YOU CARE WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THAT? YOU DON'T BELONG HERE. MAYBE YOU DID ONCE, BUT NOT NOW. GIDDAP! HYAH! UHH. WHOA! LOOKING FOR JOHN DENAMAN. HE'S NOT HERE ANYMORE. WHAT ABOUT LUZ OR MANUEL? YOU KNOW LUZ? SINCE SHE WAS 7 YEARS OLD. WHAT'S YOUR NAME? WHAT HAPPENED TO DENAMAN? NOTHING. HE JUST DIED. NOT DEAD. NO, LUZ, JUST A LITTLE TIRED, THAT'S ALL. MARTHA! Clare: HI, LUZ! CLARE! YOU'RE GONNA BE AS TALL AS YOUR PA. MY GOD. I BET DAVIS DOESN'T REMEMBER ME AT ALL. I DO, TOO. OK, LET'S SEE IF WE CAN FIND SOMETHING SWEET INSIDE. YOU WOULDN'T BE CABLE, WOULD YOU? WORD WAS YOU GOT YOURSELF DEAD AT BRICE'S CROSSROAD. USED TO BE NOBODY GAVE 2 NICKELS ABOUT ME. I'LL BUY YOU A DRINK. NAME'S JANROE. I WANT YOU TO KNOW YOU'VE GOT A FRIEND IN EDWARD JANROE. THAT'S NEIGHBORLY OF YOU. THANK YOU, LUZ. I MAY BE THE ONLY FRIEND YOU'VE GOT AROUND HERE. NOBODY KNOWS I FOLLOWED KIRBY SMITH. MAYBE IT'S NOBODY'S BUSINESS. IT'S HOW I LOST THE USE OF THIS ARM, OUTSIDE OF RICHMOND. IT SHOULD BE OF INTEREST TO YOU. WHY IS THAT? 'CAUSE WE'RE COMRADES IN ARMS. I MEAN, GOOD GOD, MAN, I CAN HELP YOU... 'CAUSE THE KIDSTONS ARE GONNA KILL YOU. I DON'T NEED ANY HELP. SO MR. CABLE JUST RODE UP ONE SUNNY DAY WITH NO WARNING? HE CAUGHT MY ATTENTION. [LAUGHS] WHO IS THIS MAN JANROE? SAYS HE'S DENAMAN'S COUSIN. MR. DENAMAN LEFT HALF THE STORE TO HIM AND HALF TO MANUEL AND ME. HOW IS YOUR BROTHER? MANUEL IS FINE. THERE ARE SOME MEN LIVIN' IN YOUR HOUSE. THEN THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO MOVE OUT. YOU KNOW, THE UNION ARMY IS THE ONLY LAW AROUND HERE. AND THE YANKEE CAVALRY'S GONNA LINE UP WITH THE RANCHERS SUPPLYING 'EM WITH THE REMOUNTS. DON'T YOU THINK? YEAH, I THINK THAT COULD BE RIGHT. [CLEARS THROAT] THANKS FOR THE DRINK. Janroe: YOU FOLKS NEED ANYTHING, I'M HERE. LUZ. TAKE CARE. DID LUZ SAY WHERE MANUEL WAS? ONLY THAT HE WAS COMIN' BACK FROM MEXICO TONIGHT WITH SUPPLIES. HYAH! [YELLING IN SPANISH] WHOA! WHOA! [SPEAKING SPANISH] [SPEAKING SPANISH] [SPEAKING SPANISH] HYAH! GIDDAP! HYAH! GIDDAP. GIDDAP. GIDDAP. WHOA! THIS IS OUR VALLEY. HERE. HOLD THESE. ABOUT 30 HEAD AND 2 MEN WITH 'EM. GOT A PLAN? WELL, SON, I'M JUST GONNA KNOCK ON THE FRONT DOOR AND TELL 'EM WE'RE HOME. CAN I LOOK? NOT NOW. ANY PROBLEMS? ANY PROBLEMS? THEY WANT 2 CRATES NEXT TIME. AMBITION'S GONNA KILL THAT MEXICAN. Woman: NO! I SAID NO! HA HA HA! GO AWAY! OHH! PLEASE! NO, I DON'T LIKE YOU! I'LL GIVE YOU A DOLLAR. A DOLLAR DON'T GIVE YOU THE RIGHT TO HURT ME! UHH! GET OFF HER. [GUN COCKS] NAME'S CABLE, AND THIS IS MY HOME. DUANE, HE-- HE TOLD US YOU WAS COMIN'. GET YOUR THINGS AND GET OUT. WELL, THAT, UH... THAT DON'T SEEM SOCIABLE. DUANE SAID IF WE HAD NOTHIN' ELSE TO DO, WE COULD KILL YOU. THAT'D BE A MISTAKE TO TRY. YOU THINK ABOUT IT, SON, 'FORE YOU PULL ON THAT HOG LEG. COME ON, CARLITA. OHH! UHH! I AIN'T ARMED! Davis: MAMA! STAY BACK! Clare: I GOT HIM. OH.. . WHAT'S VERN GONNA SAY? YOU JUST TELL HIM HOW IT HAPPENED. HE'LL UNDERSTAND. TOMORROW MORNIN', I'LL DRIVE YOUR STOCK OVER TO YOUR SPREAD. YOU'D BEST NOT BE COMIN' BACK HERE AGAIN. YES, SIR. WHERE'S MAMA? SHE'S DOWN BY THE WATER. SHE'S FINE. NOW GO BACK INSIDE LIKE I TOLD YA. [CRICKETS CHIRPING] MARTHA... YOU KNEW THEY WERE GONNA TRY TO KILL YOU. I FIGURED THEY MIGHT. YOU BECAME A KILLER, AND NOW I'M ONE. DID YOU HAVE A CHOICE? DO I HAVE ONE NOW? YOU HAVEN'T STOPPED SNARLIN' AT ME SINCE I COME HOME. YEAH, WELL, YOU'RE NOT THE MAN I MARRIED. I AM NOT THE ONLY SOLDIER WHO SERVED IN A LOSIN' CAUSE, AND YOU ARE NOT THE ONLY WOMAN TO LOSE A CHILD. YOU THINK THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ABOUT? THEY'RE ASLEEP. THINK THEY'RE GONNA BE BACK TONIGHT? NO, I DON'T. I HAD A DREAM ABOUT THE DAY YOU ASKED ME TO MARRY YOU. YOU ASKED ME. I SAID IT WAS A DREAM. BUT DADDY SAID I WAS TOO OLD, TOO SKINNY, AND TOO MEAN. YOU SAID, "I'M GONNA TRADE SOME HORSES DOWN IN MEXICO. WANNA GO ALONG?" I TOOK THAT AS A PROPOSAL. YOU REMEMBER WHEN SONNY WEST GAVE ME A GOOD SHELLACKIN' AND YOU GAVE HIM A BLACK EYE AND YOU KNOCKED OUT HIS FRONT TOOTH? YOU WENT TO HIS FATHER, AND YOU SAID, UH, "CABLE'S GOT NO MA. HE'S GOT NO GRANNY. "AND IF SONNY EVER TOUCHES HIM AGAIN, I'M GONNA SHOOT HIM DEAD." TONIGHT I SHOT 2 PEOPLE DEAD. [TREES RUSTLING] JUST THE WIND. PRIDE AND PREJUDICE. LUXURIES WE CAN'T AFFORD. I NEVER READ A BOOK IN MY LIFE. I COULDN'T EVEN WRITE MY OWN NAME UNTIL YOU TAUGHT ME. YOU'RE SMART ENOUGH. MARTHA... AN ARMY OF REBS ARE COMIN' HOME. ARE THEY ALL STRANGERS LIKE US? I KNOW ONE THING. I DON'T WANT TO LIVE WITH A WOMAN WHO DON'T LIKE ME. THINK ON IT. IF THAT'S THE WAY IT IS, I'LL TAKE YOU BACK TO TEXAS. YAH! YAH! HYAH! YAH! YAH! YAH. YAH! YAH. I TRIED TO REMEMBER EVERYTHING YOU TAUGHT ME. YOU REMEMBERED WHAT I TAUGHT YA AND MORE. I'M SORRY I MISSED IT. BUT I'M REAL PROUD OF YOU, DAUGHTER. YAH! YAH! YAH! HYAH! YAH! COME ON! HO! YOU HEARD HIM! SLOW 'EM DOWN! HURRY, BOYS! WHOO-HOO! COME ON! SHOULD REACH FORT LOWELL BY NOON TOMORROW. ISN'T THAT BILL DANCY? NOBODY'D RIDE THAT HARD WITH GOOD NEWS. IS IT APACHES? CERTAINLY AIN'T PAYDAY. THEY'RE DEAD, MR. KIDSTON. ROYCE AND JOE BOB GOT BLOWED TO HELL. I COME HERE AS QUICK AS I COULD. WHAT HAPPENED? WELL... WE WAS DRINKIN'... HAVIN' A GOOD TIME. AND JOE BOB, HE GOT A LITTLE ROUGH WITH CARLITA, AND THEN CABLE SHOWED UP. YOU WERE DRUNK. I CAN SMELL IT FROM HERE. WELL, THEN JOE BOB, HE-- HE SORTA TORE CARLITA'S DRESS. SO CABLE SHOWS UP AND SHOOTS BOTH OF 'EM 'CAUSE JOE BOB TORE SOME WHORE'S DRESS. WELL...I DON'T REMEMBER EVERYTHING. I DID HAVE A FEW DRINKS. THINK ON IT, BILL. THEN CABLE TOLD US TO GET OUT. THEN WHAT? WELL, THEY DREW IRON, THAT'S WHAT. AND THAT'S WHEN THE WOMAN COME OUT OF THE SHADOWS OVER HERE WITH A SCATTERGUN AND UNLOADED BOTH BARRELS. YOU MEAN CABLE'S WIFE SHOT ROYCE AND JOE BOB? YES, SIR. 2 DRUNKS TRYING TO MURDER HER HUSBAND-- I CAN'T SAY I'M SURPRISED. LORRAINE. WHY DIDN'T HE KILL YOU? WELL, 'CAUSE I DIDN'T HAVE MY GUN. WE GOTTA DO SOMETHIN', MR. KIDSTON. OH, I'M GONNA DO SOMETHIN'. TOMORROW, I'M GONNA SELL THESE MUSTANGS AT FORT LOWELL. AND THEN I'M GONNA TAKE A BATH, EAT A STEAK, AND SMOKE A CIGAR! AUSTIN WAS RIGHT. YOU WANNA JUST BUSHWHACK CABLE, OR YOU WANNA MURDER HIS WHOLE FAMILY? TO ME, IT'S SIX OF ONE, HALF A DOZEN TO THE OTHER. Davis: "AND ENOSH LIVED--" Martha: THAT'S ENOCH. "AND ENOCH LIVED 90 YEARS "AND BEGAT CAINAN. "AND ENOCH LIVED AFTER HE BEGAT CAINAN "815 YEARS AND BEGAT SONS AND... DAUGHTERS." Martha: THAT'S WONDERFUL. WHAT'S BEGAT MEAN, MAMA? IT MEANS FATHERIN'. NOBODY LIVES 815 YEARS. IT'S JUST A STORY, HONEY. [RAIN FALLING] HOW MANY HEIFERS YOU GONNA BUY? DADDY'S GOIN' TO MEXICO TO BUY A THOUSAND HEAD. MORE LIKE 50. BUT I LIKE YOUR CONFIDENCE. WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH GRASS FOR A THOUSAND HEAD. 50 HEAD'S A GOOD START. Man: BRING HIM AROUND. CAN'T I HAVE MY SUPPER WITHOUT HEARING A PLOT TO COMMIT MURDER? HE'S GONNA PAY FOR WHAT HE DONE. WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT ONE EX-SOLDIER WOULD BE SUCH AN OBSTACLE? WELL, CABLE WAS A HARD TWIST. HIS WAR'S LOST. ALL HE'S GOT IS... HIS PLACE AND HIS FAMILY. HIS WIFE LEAVIN' HIM MIGHT TAKE THE STARCH RIGHT OUT OF HIM. YOU LEARN TO FIGHT DIRTY AT THAT FANCY SCHOOL IN PHILADELPHIA? FROM DUANE. Davis: WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CALIBER AND GAGE? THE CALIBER IS THE SIZE OF THE BORE. IT'S THE DIAMETER OF THE INSIDE OF THE BARREL EXPRESSED IN INCHES. FOR INSTANCE, THE SHARPS IS A .52 CALIBER. SO IT'S 52 100ths OF AN INCH? EXACTLY! [HORSE NEIGHS] MORNIN', MRS. CABLE. MR. JANROE. JUST THOUGHT YOU MUST BE RUNNIN' LOW ON SUGAR AND COFFEE ABOUT NOW, SO WE THOUGHT WE'D COME ON OVER. WHERE'S YOUR HUSBAND? HE'S AROUND THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE. WHAT'D YOU BRING US, MISS LUZ? HI, MISS LUZ. HI. MR. CABLE. LUZ TELLS ME THAT YOU, UH, SOLD YOUR STOCK DOWN IN MEXICO 'FORE YOU PULLED OUT. AND I'M FIXIN' TO BUY 'EM BACK. WELL, GOOD. I'M GLAD YOU'RE ABLE TO DO THAT. [HAMMERING] CABLE, LISTEN. I'M SURE YOU'RE WONDERING ABOUT MY INTEREST IN YOUR AFFAIRS YESTERDAY. WELL... I SEEM TO BE SORT OF THE PRIZE BULL AROUND THESE PARTS LATELY. YEAH, WELL, THERE WAS A PURPOSE. DID YOU KNOW DENAMAN WAS RUNNING GUNS FOR THE SOUTH? CONFEDERATE AGENTS BRING 'EM TO A PLACE 'CROSS THE BORDER WHERE WE PICK 'EM UP. STORE'S JUST A RELAY POINT, AND WE SHIP 'EM BACK EAST. AND WHERE DO YOU FIT IN? I'M THE CHIEF AGENT FOR ARIZONA TERRITORY. WELL, THAT OUGHTA KEEP YOU BUSY. MR. CABLE, LET ME GET RIGHT TO THE POINT. THAT WOULD BE GOOD. YOUR COUNTRY NEEDS YOU. YOU'RE STILL A CONFEDERATE SOLDIER. IF I STILL BELIEVED IN THIS WAR, WHICH I DON'T, I WOULDN'T HAVE NOTHIN' TO DO WITH RUNNING GUNS. WHAT DO YOU MEAN, IF YOU BELIEVED? WAR'S OVER. LEE'S BEAT 6 WAYS FROM DIXIE, AND HE KNOWS IT. EVEN IF YOU DON'T. DADDY! THE MARE'S DOWN! DOWN BY THE ROCKS IN THE CREEK! GO GET YOUR MA. MAMA, COME QUICK. DADDY NEEDS YOUR HELP. THE MARE'S DOWN! COME ON. I'LL SHOW YOU. GET BACK! HELLO, CABLE. YOU WANNA LOSE THAT? WE FIGURED YOU'D COME SOONER OR LATER. WHAT DO YOU WANT? JUSTICE-- AND WE'RE GONNA FIND IT. AT THE LONG END OF A ROPE. YOU KILLED OUR BROTHER. BUT IT AIN'T POLITE TO HANG A LADY. SO WE'RE GONNA HANG YOUR HUSBAND INSTEAD. [HORSE NEIGHS] GET OUTTA HERE! GO ON. GET OUTTA HERE! [CLICKS TONGUE] LOOK OUT, AUSTIN! NO, NO, NO. GET UP. DON'T SHOOT ME, WYNN! WYNN! IS HE DEAD? I HOPE SO. YOU GONNA SHOOT THIS ONE? CLARE, TAKE YOUR BROTHER BACK TO THE HOUSE. NOW! GO ON, DAVIS. IN THE MORNIN', I'LL TAKE YOU IN TO DENAMAN'S. YOU'LL BE SAFE THERE. AND WHEN THE DUST CLEARS, I'LL PUT YOU ALL ON THE STAGE TO EL PASO. WHEN THE DUST CLEARS... YOU'RE GONNA BE JUST LIKE HIM. Davis: I'LL TAKE MY CHANCES. Clare: IT DIDN'T HAPPEN TO YOU. JANROE. I COULD, UH... USE SOME HELP. WE HAD A LITTLE PROBLEM YESTERDAY, AND, UH... I'D APPRECIATE IT IF MY FAMILY COULD STAY HERE A FEW DAYS. HAPPY TO OBLIGE. LIKE TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING. DON'T SEE WHY WE CAN'T STAY TOGETHER. TILL DADDY KILLS THE BLUE BELLIES, IT WON'T BE SAFE. CLARE! NO. NO. LISTEN TO ME, CABLE. THESE RIFLES... ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN ANY MAN'S LIFE. I ADMIRE YOUR SENSE OF PURPOSE. I DO. BUT IF YOU FIGURE A FEW CRATES OF BRITISH RIFLES ARE GONNA CHANGE THE OUTCOME OF THE WAR... WE'RE TALKIN' ABOUT YOUR COUNTRY HERE, MR. CABLE. DON'T YA STILL HEAR THE GUNS... THE SCREAMS OF THE WOUNDED? YOU SWORE AN OATH TO THE CONFEDERATE STATES OF AMERICA. IT'S YOUR DUTY TO KILL VERN AND DUANE. A SOLDIER'S OATH DOESN'T INCLUDE MURDER. ISN'T THAT WHAT WAR IS? IT'S MURDER ALL WRAPPED UP AND SANCTIFIED WITH A FLAG. YOU WERE AT FORT PILLOW. FORT PILLOW WASN'T WAR. IT WAS AN EXECUTION! FORREST IS A BUTCHER IN A BLACK COAT. MR. JANROE... ALL I CAN DO FOR MYSELF AND MY FAMILY IS TRY TO REBUILD OUR LIVES TOGETHER. AND I SUGGEST YOU DO THE SAME. YOU KNOW, THE DODD BROTHERS WILL NEVER FORGET THAT YOU KILLED JOE BOB. THERE'S ONLY ONE DODD LEFT. THAT'S WHY YOU BROUGHT YOUR FAMILY HERE. I COULDN'T GET A FIX ON THAT. WELL, YOU KNOW, IT SEEMS TO ME THAT YOU'RE SERVIN' YOUR COUNTRY... WHETHER YOU WANT TO OR NOT. I CONSIDER IT MY DUTY TO LOOK AFTER YOUR FAMILY. I'M GONNA HOLD YOU TO THAT. AIN'T SEEN WYNN AND AUSTIN SINCE THE DRIVE TO FORT LOWELL. WELL, COME TO THINK OF IT, I HAVEN'T SEEN 'EM EITHER. THINK THEY TRIED TO SETTLE THE SCORE WITH CABLE? DAMN IT, DUANE. YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE LOOKIN' AFTER THINGS. HELL, THEY'RE GROWN MEN. I DON'T HAVE A ROPE ON 'EM. THEY WENT TO CABLE'S PLACE LOOKIN' FOR TROUBLE, I SUSPECT THEY FOUND IT. NOW, IF YOU HAD DONE AS I SUGGESTED AND GOT RID OF CABLE, WE WOULDN'T BE HAVING ALL THESE PROBLEMS. SO YOU FIGURE THOSE HORSES WERE GONNA GET TO FORT LOWELL BY THEMSELVES. THIS IS BUSINESS. IF WE DON'T RUN IT LIKE A BUSINESS, WE'RE GONNA BE OUTTA BUSINESS. THIS WAR AIN'T GONNA LAST FOREVER, CONTRARY TO WHAT YOU THINK. [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] MUST BE HUNGRY. DON'T FIGURE YOU. IT AIN'T HARD. JUST WANNA BE LEFT ALONE. I GOT WORK TO DO. YOU BEST BE GONE WHEN I GET BACK. WANT SOME COFFEE? IT'S FRESH. RELAX. I'M ALONE. WALK? I WAS THROWN. MY HORSE RAN AWAY. THAT WAS CARELESS, WASN'T IT? THE WAY YOU'RE WALKIN'... MUST HAVE BEEN A NASTY FALL. I'LL PROBABLY BE BLACK AND BLUE TOMORROW. YOU WANT ME TO SADDLE UP ONE OF THE MUSTANGS? IT CAN WAIT TILL MORNIN'. NOW, WHAT WOULD YOUR FATHER SAY ABOUT THAT? YOU AFRAID OF MY FATHER, MR. CABLE, OR ME? OR YOURSELF? MR. JANROE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG, DID HE? I MEAN, YOU SHARE THE SAME BED. HE'S NOT REALLY INTERESTED. HE PRETENDS, BUT HE ISN'T. HE'S SO FILLED WITH HATE, THERE'S NO ROOM FOR A WOMAN. HE'S NOT THE ONLY ONE AROUND HERE. THIS HERE IS A OLD YANKEE NEWSPAPER FROM FORT LOWELL. YOUR HUSBAND SERVED WITH GENERAL FORREST, DIDN'T HE? MM-HMM. DID HE EVER BRING UP THE... INCIDENT AT FORT PILLOW, TENNESSEE? HE DOESN'T TALK ABOUT THE WAR. I DON'T ASK HIM. THERE WAS SOME CONTROVERSY. MR. JANROE, WHY DON'T YOU JUST GO AHEAD AND SAY IT, WHATEVER'S ON YOUR MIND. "GENERAL NATHAN BEDFORD FORREST STANDS ACCUSED OF EXECUTING 300 UNION PRISONERS." MOST OF 'EM NIGGERS. WAR CHANGED YOUR HUSBAND... DIDN'T IT? IT DOES ALL SOLDIERS. I MEAN, I'M NOT MAKIN' ANY JUDGMENT, BUT IT'S A FACT. SEE, AFTER A SPELL, KILLIN'... GETS EASIER, ALMOST SECOND NATURE. WHY ARE YOU TELLIN' ME THIS? WE'RE INVOLVED IN A VITAL CONFLICT RIGHT HERE. YOUR HUSBAND HAS TO ANSWER TO HIS TRUE NATURE. HIS COUNTRY NEEDS HIM. YOU'RE WRONG. HOW SO? MY HUSBAND'S A DECENT MAN. HE'S NOT A MURDERER, IN OR OUT OF UNIFORM. EVERYTHING WAS FINE UNTIL MY MOTHER DIED. NEXT THING YOU KNOW, I'M LIVING IN WASHINGTON WITH DUANE. WASN'T SO BAD WHEN HE WAS OFF CAMPAIGNING. I GOT TO DO WHAT I WANTED. YOU LIKE TO DO WHAT YOU WANT, DON'T YA? DOESN'T EVERYBODY? SOME PEOPLE DO WHAT THEY HAVE TO. WELL, WHEN DUANE GOT THROWN OUT OF THE ARMY, HE CAME OUT HERE. I HAD TO COME WITH HIM. NOW, IF HE GOT THROWN OUT OF THE ARMY, WHY'S HE STILL WEAR THE UNIFORM? 'CAUSE HE THINKS HE'S GENERAL GRANT. WHAT'D YOUR FATHER DO? HE WAS A MUSTANGER, SAME AS ME. AND HIS FATHER? SAME. AND YOUR SON, IS HE GONNA BE A MUSTANGER, TOO? DAVIS? NOPE. HE'S GONNA GET AN EDUCATION. HE'S GONNA MAKE A LIVING WITH HIS HEAD, NOT HIS BACK. MARTHA'LL SEE TO THAT. WANT SOME MORE COFFEE? I GOT A QUESTION FOR YOU. ASK IT. WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR LIMP? YOU'RE BORED. YOU'RE LOOKIN' FOR TROUBLE... AND TOOK A BATH LAST NIGHT. I KNOW YOU LIKE ME. SURE, I LIKE YOU. BUT IT DON'T MAKE IT RIGHT. LATER ON TONIGHT, YOU'LL BE SORRY. I'M ALREADY SORRY. MORNIN'. SEND LORRAINE ON OUT HERE. WELL... YOU'RE PRETTY FREE AND EASY WITH MY DAUGHTER'S REPUTATION. MR. CABLE WAS A PERFECT GENTLEMAN. MY HONOR'S INTACT. UNFORTUNATELY. IN ANY EVENT, A GUN BATTLE TO RECLAIM MY REPUTATION WOULD BE GRATUITOUS. GET ON. BUT I'VE MADE A VERY NICE BREAKFAST. LORRAINE. YOU GOT 2 DAYS TO MOVE ON. YOU KEEP YOUR STOCK OFF MY LAND. I GOT CATTLE COMIN' IN. IF THAT'S THE CASE, I'LL KILL YOU MYSELF. THANKS FOR THE VERY NICE BREAKFAST. Man: LOOK AT THIS. Luz: IT'S OVER! IT'S OVER! WHAT ARE YOU TALKIN' ABOUT? WHAT'S OVER? THE WAR! THE WAR'S OVER! IN HIDALGO, EVERYBODY KNOWS. IT'S ON THE FRONT PAGE! THIS IS A LIE. THEY TOLD ME TO COME BACK AND TELL YOU. HOW COULD THEY BE SO SURE? THE TELEGRAPH DOESN'T LIE. MR. JANROE! WARS DON'T JUST END LIKE THIS. HOW DO THEY END? THERE'S SOME WARNING. IT WOULD BE DAYS, WEEKS BEFORE THEY END. THIS IS ARIZONA TERRITORY. WE'RE NOT IN RICHMOND. THIS COULD BE A YANKEE TRICK. ANYBODY CAN SEND A MESSAGE OVER A WIRE. FOR WHAT GAIN? LUZ, CAN I TAKE YOUR HORSE? NO, NO. I'LL TELL CABLE. I-- I'M GOIN' OUT THAT WAY ANYWAY. YOU ALL RIGHT? YES. THIS IS GOOD NEWS, MAMA. WHO WON? FOR A MAN WITH A PRICE ON HIS HEAD, YOU'RE A BIT CARELESS, CABLE. OH...I COULD HAVE SHOT YOU BACK AROUND THE BEND. YOUR HORSE THREW A SHOE. BLIND MAN COULD FIND YOU IN THE DARK. VERN KIDSTON AIN'T GONNA LIKE YOU RUNNING HIS HORSES. I'LL NEED THE GRASS. FOR WHAT? I SEE NO OVERALLS. YOU AIN'T NO FARMER. I DON'T SEE NO CATTLE. WELL, YOU WILL, WHEN YOU RIDE DOWN TO NOGALES AND BUY 'EM. MAYBE KIDSTON WILL KILL YOU BEFORE I RETURN. THEN SELL THE CATTLE, GIVE THE MONEY TO MARTHA. HA HA. MAYBE I KEEP THE MONEY. THEN ENJOY YOURSELF. HA HA! CABLE? CABLE? CABLE? CA-- [SPEAKING SPANISH] IT'S OVER. [SPEAKING SPANISH] SÍ. MAYBE THE KIDSTONS WON'T BE SO ANGRY ANYMORE, YOU CAN STAY. MAYBE JANROE WILL GO BACK TO WHERE HE CAME FROM. MY HUSBAND'S GOLD. THIS? THIS IS NOT GOLD. THIS IS SOME COWS AND A YOUNG BULL WHO KNOWS HOW TO TAKE CARE OF BUSINESS. WAS HE ALL RIGHT? CABLE? HE'S ALL RIGHT. HA HA! CABLE IS ALWAYS ALL RIGHT. EVENIN', MAJOR. WHO'S THERE? EDWARD JANROE. DIDN'T MEAN TO STARTLE YOU. YOU DIDN'T STARTLE ME. YOU ALL ALONE HERE? MY DAUGHTER'S SLEEPIN' IN THE HOUSE. I SUPPOSE YOU'VE HEARD THE NEWS. IT'S ONLY GOSSIP. NOPE. NO, SIR. ROBERT E. LEE SURRENDERED THE ARMY OF VIRGINIA TO GENERAL GRANT. THAT IS NOT GOSSIP. THAT IS FACT. FACTS HAVE A WAY OF CHANGIN', DEPENDIN' ON WHO'S ISSUIN' THEM. THE SMOKE, SMELL OF CHANCELLORSVILLE IN MY HEART TONIGHT, I DRINK TO ALL THOSE BRAVE MEN WHO DIED THERE. YOU'D UNDERSTAND IF YOU'D SERVED. I DIDN'T LOSE THE USE OF THIS ARM FALLIN' OFF A BAR STOOL. I FOUGHT WITH KIRBY SMITH. YOU AND CABLE. HA. WELL, YOU MAY HAVE BEEN A SOLDIER ONCE, BUT YOU'RE JUST A GROCERY CLERK NOW. UNDERNEATH THE STORE, I GOT 2 DOZEN CASES OF ENFIELDS. SIR, I ADVISE YOU TO TURN THEM IN TO THE AUTHORITIES AT FORT BOLT OR FACE ARREST. NOBODY'S GONNA ARREST ME. 'CAUSE NOBODY KNOWS ABOUT THEM RIFLES. EXCEPT YOU. GIVE IT UP, JANROE. GO ON HOME. SIR, I DON'T BELIEVE YOU UNDERSTAND. I UNDERSTAND I AM TALKING TO A MAN WHO IS NOT IN COMPLETE CONTROL OF HIS FACULTIES. PEOPLE GONNA THINK CABLE SHOT YOU FOR WRECKIN' HIS HOUSE. THAT'S FOR GENERAL SHERMAN. THAT'S FOR MR. LINCOLN. I'M SORRY ABOUT YOUR FATHER. WE KNOW WHO DID IT? I WAS SLEEPING. I HEARD 2 SHOTS. BY THE TIME I GOT TO HIM, NO ONE WAS THERE. WELL, WHO WOULD IT BE IF IT WASN'T CABLE? WHO ELSE HAD ANY REASON? WELL, CABLE MIGHT'VE DONE IT, BUT IT SEEMS LIKE WE OUGHTA BE SURE. AND WE'RE NOT SURE. THAT'S THE THING. I'M AS SURE AS I NEED TO BE. MR. KIDSTON? I DON'T BELIEVE CABLE KILLED DUANE. CABLE KILLED BOTH MY BROTHERS, BUT THEY WERE FAIR FIGHTS. HE COULD'VE KILLED ME, AND NOBODY WOULD'VE SAID BY YOUR LEAVE. WELL, YOU'RE ENTITLED TO YOUR OPINION. I HAD 2 BROTHERS. NOW I GOT NONE. I GOT A MOTHER IN KANSAS. WELL, YOU'RE A GOOD HAND, AUSTIN. THANK YOU. THIS MORNIN', MR.

I'M ALL RIGHT... BUT DADDY'S HURT. THANKS FOR HELPIN' MY DAD. GLAD I COULD, SON. CLARE SAID THAT YOU AND MR. KIDSTON COULD'VE PUT SIR LANCELOT TO SHAME. WHAT SPREAD'S HE WORK FOR? WE ALL OWE VERN. MAYBE WE CAN ALL LIVE HERE IN PEACE NOW. YOU TALKIN' ABOUT THE WAR BETWEEN THE STATES OR THE WAR BETWEEN US? THE DISADVANTAGE OF KNOWIN' A MAN ALL HIS LIFE IS THAT A WOMAN NEVER EXPECTS HIM TO CHANGE, AND WHEN HE DOES, IT RATTLES HER. I CAN'T REMEMBER WHEN THE CABLE YOU KNEW DIED. TELL ME ABOUT FORT PILLOW. ALL MEN SIN, ESPECIALLY IN WAR. WE SLAUGHTERED UNARMED PRISONERS. THEY WORE YANKEE BLUE, AND WE GUNNED 'EM DOWN LIKE DOGS. YOU DIDN'T SHOOT UNARMED MEN. NO... BUT I-- I COULDN'T DO ANYTHING TO STOP IT. MARY DIED, AND I COULDN'T DO ANYTHING TO STOP IT. WE DON'T CONTROL OUR LIVES. WE PRETEND WE DO, BUT IT'S SELF-DECEPTION. WITH ALL MY STRENGTH, I REACHED OUT FOR MY CHILD, BUT SHE SLIPPED AWAY. SO I BLAMED MYSELF, AND WHEN THAT WORE OUT, I BLAMED YOU. IF THERE WASN'T NO WAR AND YOU WERE BESIDE MARY'S BED HOLDING HER HAND, SHE STILL WOULD HAVE DIED. I DON'T KNOW WHY I WENT TO WAR. MAYBE I'LL NEVER KNOW. BUT I DO KNOW THIS. THERE WASN'T A DAY GONE BY I DID NOT REGRET LEAVING YOU AND THE CHILDREN. AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO ME THAT YOU KNOW THAT. IT'S IMPORTANT TO ME THAT YOU SAID IT. SO WHERE'S THAT LEAVE US? WE LET THE WAR AND MARY SLEEP... AND NATURE CAN DO THE REST. CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY WARNER BROS.
