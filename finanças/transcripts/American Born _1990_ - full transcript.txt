[MUSIC PLAYING] (SINGING) All I know is when I look at you, I get such a feeling. Don't you feel it too? Let me share it all with you. {} In a world where true loves are so few, I felt something special, and I know you feel it too. This is our moment in the sun, and love has just begun to shine our way. And for as long as we both live it's love to you I'll give. Forever. And ever. I remember how it used to be, searching for a love to hold, and someone who needs me. I'd find it only in my dreams. Don't you worry, I'll be by your side, and I'm going to do my best to keep you safe and satisfied. This is our moment in the sun and love has just begun to shine our way. And for as long as we both live, it's love to you I'll give. Oh, oh I love you, I love you, I love you. What about me? Carly, can you keep a secret? Yeah. No, I mean a big one. Sure. This car used to belong to Al Capone. This was the getaway in the St. Valentine's Day Massacre. The movie? Oh, no, no, the real one. Wow. I had a great uncle who got killed. But don't worry about it. See, my uncle Joey, he inherited it. And if you're good to me, babe, I might take you for a little ride. I'm late. I'm drunk. My father's going to kill me. Let's just go sit in it for a minute. I can't. Come on, just for minute, Carly. Get the fuck out of here. Get out of here. SALLY BOY: We'll go get some coffee. CARLY: No! SALLY BOY: We'll go to the parlor, make us a pizza. CARLY: I want to see the car. I love you. [DOOR SLAMS] Wait, wait. What? What? Meet me in the restaurant in the back booth. I'm going to make you scream. Promise? Mm-hmm. Oh, you know you don't have to act with me. You don't have to say anything or do anything. Not a thing. Just whistle. You know how to whistle, don't you? You just put your lips together and blow. [WHISTLING] [SCREAMING] (YELLING) Carly! Oh my god! What's wrong? What's wrong? [CAMERA CLICKS] PATSY: Hold it. Who are you? PATSY: He's my brother. Sally, Sally, is he OK? Who are you? We're his uncles, is he OK? Physically, yes. What the fuck does that mean? It means that there's no physical injury, but he is in shock. How long will he be like this? In a case like this, your guess is as good as mine. Let me talk to him. Hey, Sally Boy. It's your uncle Patsy. Hey, kid, whoever did this, we're going to take care of business. I swear to you and I swear to Frankie, we're going to get him. You're not doing anything, Anunziata. This is a police matter. We'll take care of it. This is a family matter. We take care of our own business. I see that. You [INAUDIBLE] Patsy, Patsy, Patsy! Come on. Let it go, let it go. I ought to haul your dago ass into jail for assaulting a cop. Now you and you, both of you, get the hell out of here. Take the kid with you. It was awful. RYAN: Poor baby. It's OK, baby. [BELL TOLLS] Hey, I said no flowers. Patsy, the flowers are from Don Panchinzo. I don't give a shit who gave them. Frankie hated flowers. Now get rid of them. And hurry up, the people are going to start coming. [ORGAN MUSIC] [SOBBING] My deepest sympathies, Patsy. Frankie was a good [INAUDIBLE]. Thank you. [INAUDIBLE] I'm sorry. Thank you. Angelo. It's nice to see you pay your respects to the dead. I wouldn't have it any other way. My deepest sympathies to you, Salvatore. If there's ever anything I can do for you, you'll let me know, huh? Patsy. You don't worry about the funeral, eh? My brother Philly and I took care of everything. It's the least I could do for Frankie, huh? Thank you, Don Marco. So full of shit, that phony son of a bitch. Cool it, Patsy, come on. Somebody might hear. [SOBBING] Yeah. Yeah, OK, honey. Bye-bye. Patsy called. He's going to be late, so please start. There's more for us. Who could've done this thing? I don't know, yet. But somebody has slapped me in the face and I will find out who. Well when you do, please let me take care of this thing. I sympathize with you, Patsy. But this thing goes much deeper than Frankie. Frankie was a good man, huh? But I'm out $50,000. Hey, and I'm out a brother. I'm out a brother. Listen, Don Marco, I promised my nephew Sally Boy that I would take care of this thing. And so far I can't find anything out on the streets. I need your help. You run numbers, Patsy. I run the family. What I need from you now is to take over for Frankie until-- But Don Marco-- Hey! I'm sorry. It's not a good time for me. I need some time off. I understand. I'll have Vinnie Sheets and Willy the Book take over for Frankie until you and Carmine can come back, huh? Hey, Patsy. If you're wise, you forget about this revenge thing. I got some business to take care of now, Patsy. Patsy. Have a nice day. [CLICK] Gotta hand it to Marco. It was a hell of a funeral. You know, Frankie would've been proud. Yeah, yeah, Marco really outdid himself. What did you think of this sausage and peppers, huh? Terrific. Yeah, Millie made it. - Millie? - Yeah. Hey. One hell of a cook. Hey, canolis. Hey. Two dozen, compliments of Vinnie Sheets. Canoli. Canoli. Hi, honey. Hi, sweetie. Hey. Espresso's ready. I got your plate warm for you. Carmine, Joey. Come on. Did you hear anything? Yeah, Marco is pissed. You know I bet it was those fucking mulignans in Parkchester. Those guys are walking around like they own the neighborhood. I hate those motherfuckers. Hey, hey, hey, you don't know that, so don't go shooting your mouth off. Marco said he's going to take care of this thing his way. He told me to just forget about it. Fuck Marco. It ain't his brother. And he ain't yours either. Hey, listen, don't get crazy on me, OK? I got a thing. Jesus. Hey, Marco said drop it. Let's not start fucking with him when he gives an order, OK? Let him take care of it. It'll get done, OK? What does it matter who makes the hit, just as long as it's done? He's got his reasons. See, that's it, OK. There you go. Hey, whoa, I gotta go. I gotta meet these people. I'm catering a big party, I got to finalize everything. Hey, Joey. Why don't you let Louie do it? Come on, we'll play a little five and 10. Hey, forget Louie, huh? If he wasn't your goddamn nephew, I'd fire his ass a long time ago. Why? He's head case, Carmine. He's always crying he's broke, but don't come to work in two days. Today he says he's got a cold. Sure ain't eating like he's sick. All right, let me talk to him. Hey, don't waste your time. He's a loser. Listen, I'll see you later, OK? Goodbye. Come home early tonight, baby, OK? You know I'll rub you down all over and I'll give you a nice bath. Gee, you know what? We just buried Frankie today, huh? Hey, all you ever have on your mind is sex? Don't embarrass me with you drinking, OK? I only had two. So far. Come on, how about some coffee and canoli, OK? Millie, the espresso's on the table, honey. Patsy. I'm worried about Sally Boy. Hey, don't worry about it. He's a tough kid. Yeah, well maybe he's not so tough. Did you see him at the cemetery? He just stared. Just like it the wake. He didn't even notice his girlfriend. I tried calling his house. There's no answer. There's nobody there. I am worried about him, Patsy. And I think that we should invite him over here and have him stay with us for a while, you know? Just in case. Well, maybe you're right. You know, we're all he has now. I'm going to go change and I'll check on him, OK, sweetheart? I'll see you later. OK. All right. Hey, Louie, what is I hear that you're sick? I got pneumonia. Pneumonia. How long are you going to have this pneumonia? I don't know. I don't know. Hey, I promised your father on his deathbed that you weren't going to end up like him. Did you see Carmine? No. I wonder where he is. Did you see him? Now listen to me. Joey has given you a very nice job. Nice job my ass, Carmine. I'm a fucking bartender. Hey, it's uncle Carmine. You watch your goddamn mouth. We just buried Frankie. Good. So leave me the fuck alone, OK? Hey, you son of a-- Good, there you are. Honey, I've been looking all over for you. Here's is scotch you wanted. No, I don't have time. Look, I've got to go home, I'm got to stop someplace. I'll see you later. Carmine, where are you going? Hey, where is everybody going? JIMMY: How was the funeral? JOEY: Yeah, just great, Jimmy. Thanks. JIMMY: Your appointment is waiting. JOEY: Yeah, well listen. Why don't you take the rest of the day off, OK? Thanks, Joey. By the way, the ice machine is leaking. It's OK, I'll take care of it. I was going to tell Angie. Hey, it's OK. Come on, go home. Do you want I should clean up around it? It's OK, come on. [MUSIC PLAYING] [INAUDIBLE] loves [INAUDIBLE]. I want you to want me. Me. Oh, oh, [INAUDIBLE] Yeah, your Aunt Connie's worried about you, kid. She wants you to come and stay with us for-- look, kid. I think we should reopen the pizza place, you know? It's yours now. I went around asking about who could have done this thing, and Marco told me to back off. There's nothing I can do. Look, I want them too, kid, but life goes on, and we got to go with it. I love you too, kid. [TOILET FLUSHING] Ah! [GROANING] My nose! You fucking weasel. You owe me money! I paid it, Carmine. I swear on my mother's grave. You don't got no mother. You owe Frankie $10,000. I paid it! Ask Marco. Maybe Frankie was skimming. [GROANING] You fucking lie about the dead? I'll tear your fucking tongue out. No, no, no! Tomorrow, please! I swear, please! You son of a bitch You can have it. You can have it. Ah, no, please! Tomorrow I want the rest. Or cockroaches won't want what's left of you. Ow! Oh, excuse me. We need some bus fare. Hey! What are you, stupid? I said we need some bus fare. [DIALING] [PHONE RINGING] [GUNSHOTS ON TV] Jeez, I'm getting my can kicked here. We need a fucking rummy. Never could play cards, pretty boy. What? Look out, boys. I'm going to spit. [GUNSHOTS] What the fuck is going on? Who is this fucking guy? I'll kill him. Holy shit. It's Sally Boy. Sally Boy? Yeah, it's Sally Boy. Sally Boy, what the fuck? Shut up, pretty boy. What? I said shut up. JOEY: Come on, kid. This is your uncle Joey here. Put down the gun and don't fuck around, OK? [GUNFIRE] God dammit! This is crazy! Ain't this great? SALLY BOY: Patsy. Yeah. SALLY BOY: Marco owes me a favor. I want to sit down, tomorrow night. Make the call. OK. You're as nuts as he is. SALLY BOY: Pretty boy, clean this club up. It's a mess. Blackie, give him a hand. Sure, boss. Anything you say. I'll be in touch. New shooter now coming out. Crap 11, seven, bets down and set. [INAUDIBLE] 11. $1.11. Six easy. Six, six, part is six. Bet the hard way now, two threes. Hard six. Hard six, 200. [CAR DOOR CLOSES] Hey. Hey, Patsy. Marco Rampoli I'd like to introduce you to Don Salvatore Anunziata. We request a sit down with you. It's my pleasure to meet you, Don Salvatore. Tony, come on. We'll take my table. We'll have a sit down with the Anunziata family. [LAUGHTER] Sally Boy. Here we go, point six. Six now shoot it. What can the Rampoli family do for the Anunziatas, eh? Don Marco, you once said if there was anything you could do, I should ask. This is true. And I'm a man of honor, no? Then I wish to find out who killed Frankie Fingers. Well, I've already discussed this matter with your consigliere. Then maybe you should discuss it with me. What the fuck, Marco? Who does his punk think he is? Get the fuck out of here. Who the fuck are you calling a punk? Put the gun down, Carmine, put it away. Show some respect for Don Marco. I apologize, Don Marco. Perhaps you're right, Salvatore. Perhaps we should have discussed this matter with you first. I'll look into this matter. Give me a couple of days. You have 12 hours. As you say, 12 hours. Oh, Blackie. I forgot to tell you, Benny the Weasel already paid his note to me. Marco. Hey. And in return for your past work I give you nephew Louie a job with us. I give him a chance to earn. Thank you. Thank you, Marco. Marco, want to tell me what the hell is going on here? [LAUGHTER] The answers to all our problems with the Mantuccis just walked out of here. What are you talking about? Murder incorporated is about to live again. [LAUGHTER] God damn it. This ain't the goddamn movies here. We're not the Corleone family. Hey, Patsy, listen. We ain't kids up in Castle Hill breaking somebody's bones for some schmuck that they came up short at the end of the week. I don't want any part of this, all right? What about Frankie, huh? What about Frankie? They tortured him. They blew his finger off just to get that ring of his. He was good to us, he's the reason you have this fucking club. We owe him. And if that means following some kid around who thinks he's in a Bogey film, then god damn we're going to do it. Our promise to Sally Boy is like a promise to Frankie. That was your fucking promise. Not mine. You know something? All you give a shit about is your pretty face and how much pussy you can get out. You want out? Fuck you, you're out. Fuck you. Come on, Carmine, let's get the fuck out of here. Jesus Christ. [GUNSHOTS] [KNOCKING] Sally Boy! Come on, answer the door. How come you don't answer my calls? Sally Boy! I've given your request my utmost consideration. But it is with my deepest regret, Salvatore, that I must tell you that I can not help you in this matter. Why is this, Don Marco? Last night Vinnie Sheets and Willy the Book were gunned down and robbed. I lost another 40 gs. I've learned who is responsible for this matter. And I will take care of this thing myself. You gave your word, Don Rampoli. And I will keep it. But this is a business matter. This is a family matter. Your word is your bond. Blood before money! Salvatore, you shame me. Please. You're right. My word is my bond, as it has always been. Blood before money. So be it. All of my sources tell me that the Mantuccis are responsible for hitting Frankie Fingers. The Mantuccis? Angelo Mantucci? Frankie was his friend. I mean, Frankie used to lay off action with this guy. Ever since they teamed up with the blacks and their fucking drugs, they're no longer part of the [INAUDIBLE]. [LAUGHTER] If you must go through with this thing, Salvatore, it is with my blessing. But I must tell you now, you and your family must do this thing on your own. The other families will not get involved. This is bad for business. Tony. Tommy G and a little motherfucking black man named Chichi. They are the ones that made the hits. Luca, Angelo Mantucci, they all got to die. The blood debt is passed to you, Salvatore. The prayers of all the families go with you. For the soul! ALL: For the soul! Woo. Hey, baby. Hey, baby, looking for a party? The way they dress, I think do. Is that Chichi over there? Yeah, baby, that's Chichi. [LAUGHTER] Well, what do we have here? Al fucking Capone. Check it out. Hey, you boys lost in the Twilight Zone or something? It's New York City, man. Chicago's like west of here. Hey, what can Chichi do for you, huh? Little pussy? Huh? Blow? How about some accessories for your threads, my friend? I got the best in town. Necklaces, watches. I told you, don't touch the car. Get out of here. Get out of here. CHICHI: Go with your threads, my man. Don't touch the car. Get out of here. Chichi's got it going on. This is Chichi's world. So what do you want, and how much will you pay? SALLY BOY: I want Frankie Fingers back. [SCREAMING] [GUNSHOTS] [MUSIC PLAYING] Millie, come on, honey. I want you to go home. Let me call you a cab. But Joey. I'm gonna make a nice espresso, you like that. Yeah, he's cheating, you know. He's cheating on me. ANGIE: See, Millie, that's the booze talking right now. Joey's not cheating. I mean look at this place. He flirts, sure, I flirt, we all flirt. That's what makes this place popular. That's a lot of crap and you know it. He don't even come near me since I lost the baby. It ain't that, Millie. MILLIE: Well I ain't fat. I mean I still look good. So why don't he want me? How about that? You ever think it might be the booze? Huh? Yeah, it's never his fault, is it, Angie? It's never Joey. It's always me. I need some air. Where are you going? Come on. MILLIE: You ain't my friend. ANGIE: Come on, where you going? [DING] Luca Mantucci? Hey, faggot. This is for Frankie Fingers. [GUNSHOTS] [CAR DOOR SLAMS] Hey. Patsy, what's going on, man? You've got to pay for Frankie Fingers. What the fuck you talking about? I had nothing to do with that. Fucking liar. [CHOKING] Patsy, I swear to god. I'd no beef with Frankie. Sally Boy, this is Tommy G, man. I still owe bets with your father. He was my friend, god-- ahh! Sleep with [INAUDIBLE] and you die with [INAUDIBLE].. [SCREAMING] Fuck. Oh my god. I gotta get the fuck out of here. Angie. Hey. Here, have a piece of pizza. This stuff is almost as good as Frankie's. How can you eat that shit after all we just did, huh? Angie, you ready? Yeah, I'm ready. Go wait for me outside. Those motherfuckers got what they deserved. What are we going to do if Angelo finds out about this? If he hasn't already, Carmine. Don't worry about it. By the time he finds out it's the Anunziatas, he's going to be dead. You fuckhead. You ain't no Anunziata, and don't forget it. I don't want any part of this revenge shit anymore, all right? Yes, oh! Oh, harder. More, yes. Joey. Hey, Millie. It's not what you think. Come on. You son of a bitch. Why? Because he doesn't love you anymore. He loves me. You shut up you fucking whore, not talking to you. - Come on. - Why? Tell me? Is it because of the baby? No, no. Please don't blame me. No, I'm not, I'm not. She can't be better than me, Joey. No. I'm the best you ever had, you said so. Lupe is number one. That was before me. Shut up. Shut up, you fucking whore! I'm gonna kill you, you bitch! [INTERPOSING VOICES] Fuck both of you! You bitch! [SHRIEKING] You OK? Mind your own fucking business. All right? [SHRIEKING] Just a little pussy to break the got damn tension. What's the big deal, huh? Hey, fuck the both of you, eh? [EXPLOSION] Millie! No! ALL: Capo! Salute. Salute. [LAUGHTER] It's getting too dangerous, this neighborhood. Now you should have stayed up in Buffalo with your mother. I want you to go back there. No. You're not sending me away. I'm not your little baby anymore. I'm staying here. No you're not. This is because of me and Sally Boy, right? It's because there's a god damn war going on here. Sally Boy has nothing to do with that. I don't know that yet. And until I do, you're staying the hell away from him and in this apartment. He just lost his father. How can you be so cruel? Mom was right, you're just a cop. Carly. [DOOR CLOSES] Yeah, Ryan, what is it? What the hell's going on here, inspector? Why won't you give me any help with these killings? Hey, Ryan, one dago wise guy kills another. What's the big deal? So we're not supposed to let that happen. Hey, the Mantucci family's been a thorn in our butts for years. This thorn is going to be surgically and completely removed. It should only happen to those fucking Rampolis, they should kill them all. So why fuck with a good thing? I live in this neighborhood, inspector. I want this shit to stop. OK. So stop it. But do it alone. Hey, Charlie? Pull a file on Frankie Fingers, will you? And anything you have any thing you have on the Anunziata family. Yeah, and give me all you got on Carmine Mazur. Drop it on my desk as soon as possible, OK? I'll be back in an hour. Thank you. [KNOCKING] Ooh, Sally Boy. I thought you might like it If I came up to see you sometime, big boy. I'm sorry, I don't know you. You don't recognize me? It's me, Carly. What's going on? You got somebody else? I'm very sorry, miss. You must have the wrong apartment. Yeah, I must have the wrong apartment. I love you. How the hell did they find out? That bomb went off not even an hour after we had Tommy G. Jesus. Millie. Poor Millie. She was a beautiful woman. I'm sorry. Thank God Joey's still alive. It don't figure. It just don't figure. Was a warning. Angelo Mantucci sent us a warning because of Luca. That was no warning. Angelo walks around like he's got nine lives. Guys got no fear. I don't like it. It's beginning to smell like a setup. A setup? Yeah. Something's got to be done, because we're next. That's going to be tough. Don't worry. Angelo Mantucci dies. My way. Let me take him down, boss. OK, pretty boy. [ORGAN MUSIC] Angelo Mantucci. You should know, Angelo, your brother now walks with God. And thank you for that very generous contribution to our Christmas fund. It is my honor, Father Rich. Thank you. Ange, I must talk to father about the Christmas sale this weekend. Be right back. Come, let's talk in the sacristy. [GUNSHOTS] - Hey, Patsy. - How you doing? All right. How you doing. Carmine, [INAUDIBLE]. This is Doris. Doris, Patsy. Hi, Doris, pleased to meet you. - Carmine. - It's a pleasure. Do you want to join us? Nah, I got a table waiting over there. Hey, Patsy, it's nice to see that Angelo made his peace with God. Carmine, how are you doing? How's Sally Boy. Well, you know, he's doing OK, you know. Good. I want to make some room for him now. Give him a chance to earn. He proved himself to me. Well, I don't think he's ready yet. Give him a little more time, please. I understand. Hey, office's getting busy is a bastard now, too. I'm going to need both of you back. Well, maybe when things cool off a little bit. OK? Don't worry about the other families. That's all taken care of. Blessings are with you. Thank you, [INAUDIBLE]. Good. All right. I'll talk to you later. - See you later. Good. Good. Good, eh? Thank you. Yeah, good. Enjoy. Hey, watch out for Ryan. That Irish prick is asking a lot of questions. All right. Thanks Marco. Good job. Look, I'm sorry I have to bring you in here at this time, but I've got a few more questions I have to ask you. Now we've identified Millie, and your porter Jimmy the Gimp Rotelli. And another person by the name of Loopy Valdez. Ask my lawyer. Come on, Joey, don't try to be a wise guy, hey? You ain't got it. Right now you're the number one suspect in this bombing, which has resulted in three counts of murder, so don't fuck with me, OK. Are you going to charge me? No. God damn it, Joey, there's a war going on here, and I want it to stop now. And tell your nephew to keep his ass away from my daughter. That's a warning. I don't know what you mean. Come on, Louie. Shit or get off the pot. $500 to you. Come on, we gonna play cards or what? I got [INAUDIBLE] in there too, take it easy, all right? Give me another marker. Louie, you're already into the house for $1,000. No more credit. Can I talk to you for a second? Joey, take over. How much you give me for it? I'll give you $1,000. I'll kill your marker. God damn thing's worth five grand. Take it or leave it. Give me the cash. Just give me the cash. come on. You know you're a whore, you know that? A whore. You know what a whore is? You're a whore, you know what that means? Come on. She's dealing from the bottom of the deck. I heard you was a big shot working for Marco, huh? What the hell you doing here, Carmine? Get in the car. Get out of here, Carmine. I got to go see Marco. Fuck Marco. You get the fucking car. What the hell are you going to do, huh? Son of a bitch. I ought to blow your fucking brains out. I ought to blow your fucking fingers off. You wasted Frankie. I didn't do anything, Uncle Carmine. I swear to God I didn't do it, Uncle Carmine! Don't lie to me you son of a bitch! [INAUDIBLE] [SCREAMING] I didn't do it! What I have to tell you breaks my heart, and it shames my family name. Patsy, you were right about the setup. It was the Rampolis who killed Frankie, and they burned the club. They said that Frankie was skimming. That's a fucking lie, you shut your mouth! Hey, hey, hey. Let him finish, let him finish. Who told you this? I got it from one of the guys that was responsible. Louie? Yeah. Him and Benny the Weasel. You little mother fucker! You little mother fucker! Patsy, Patsy, come on! Patsy, Patsy, come on. Come on. He's not worth it. He's not worth it. Fuck. I can't fucking believe it. Dammit. The hit on Benny and Willie, that was just a setup. Just a lot of smoke to make us go after the Mantuccis. Marco. We got rid of his problems, and he fucked us real good. I want to tear his fucking heart out. Let me do this. Salvatore, please, let me do this. How can you be sure what of what you say? My nephew used this to cover a bet. Blackie, you know what must be done. Blood before money. Do this thing in your own way, and I never want to see his face again. [GUN COCKS] [GUNSHOTS] [EXPLOSION] CONNIE: Yeah, well I've finally finished the three dozen zeppoles, thank god. Yeah, well I'm going to make the pizza squares for Christmas Eve. Yeah, I hope so. Honey, tell me something. Any word from Sally Boy? Oh, God. I'm worried. Yeah. Hi honey. Yeah, I know what you mean. Looking, Ange, I gotta go. Yeah, I'll see you for midnight mass, OK honey? Yeah. All right, bye bye, now. Take care. What's the matter? Nothing. What nothing? You walk into the house and you don't say a word to me, and you're drinking up a bottle of scotch? Leave it alone, Connie. Leave it alone? You turned into some kind of gangster, and you want me to leave it alone? What the hell is going on here, Patsy? It's business, Connie, and you know better than to ask me about my business. Isn't what happened to Frankie and Millie enough heartbreaks for one family? Look at your nephew Sally Boy. Look what's happened to him. You know, I read the papers, Patsy. I'm not stupid. I know what's going on. I have always stayed out of your business. I just didn't want anything to happen to you. Louie Mazza killed Frankie. Marco gave the order. Oh my God. [KNOCKING] [SOBBING] He won't get away with this double cross, Frankie. The lousy stinking rat's going to pay. Me and the boys are going to make sure of that. I wish you were here, Frankie. I miss you. [CAR HORNS] Yeah. Can't find Louie. Can't even find his car. Don't worry about him. Probably skipped off to Atlantic City with some bimbo. He'll be back. And when he does get back, I want you to give him the hit on Sally Boy Anunziata. He did the father, it's only proper he do the son, huh? It's only right. I already split up with Carmine and Patsy what was left of the Mantuccis. Why shouldn't everybody be happy? But this is not to happen until after the New Year. And why is that? We're going to let them have a nice holiday. Make sure you go to confession. Remember when it's over, we meet back here. Sally Boy, I think this is too dangerous. You should let me go with you. You all have your jobs to do. I'll be OK. Is everything OK with Joey? Yeah, he knows what to do. [BELL TOLLS] I love you, kid. Save me a seat, honey. I'm going to find a place to park. OK. Hey, pumpkin. I've been thinking, why don't you stay down here with me? I love you, Dad. Regardless of what your mother thinks of me? You're not just a cop. You're a good one. [BELL TOLLS] I love you, sweetie. [CAR DOOR CLOSES] [ORGAN MUSIC] Carly. Come sit here. My father's with me. That's OK, honey, we have room. Thanks. [ORGAN MUSIC CONTINUES] [DOOR SLAMS OPEN] [MUFFLED GUNSHOTS] [ORGAN MUSIC CONTINUES] [MUFFLED SCREAMING] [MUFFLED GUNSHOTS] No! [GUNSHOTS] [ORGAN MUSIC CONTINUES] [GUNSHOTS] [ORGAN MUSIC CEASES] [PIANO TRILL] Hey, Eddie. Get the hell out of here. Merry Christmas. What [INAUDIBLE] with your family, eh? Hey, if you hurry you'll catch midnight mass. Go ahead. Good job. Thank you. Merry Christmas. [DICE ROLL] MARCO: Snake eyes. On Christmas Eve, what luck. Hey, Sally Boy. What a surprise. Merry Christmas. Hey, I'm having a big party at the house tonight. Please, join me, eh? We got to party. You double crossed me, Marco. It was you that had Frankie hit. And now you pay. Hey, wait a minute, punk. You know, I went along with your little gangster game for a while because I felt bad for you. You look kind of cute. But nobody comes into my joint and threatens me. Nobody. All the others are dead, Marco. Benny the Weasel, Louie, Tony Bones, and your brother. And now, [GUN COCKS] You're next. Hey, Salvatore. This is not the time for these things with guns and-- it's Christmas. Drop the gun, punk. So you want to be a wise guy, huh, punk? Well, you ain't get the heart. [GRUNTING] I was going to let you enjoy the holidays, but now? [SPITS] Get this piece of shit out of here. I don't ever want to see his face again. [GUNSHOTS] What the fuck? Freeze! [GUNSHOTS] [SCREAMING] So you want to be a big shot? How's this? Merry Christmas. No! Happy New Year. [GUNSHOT] Patsy. Patsy. Sally Boy! Get help! No! Oh my God. Please. Oh my God. [SOBBING] He's not dead. [SOBBING] Sally, please don't die! [SOBBING] [MUSIC PLAYING]
