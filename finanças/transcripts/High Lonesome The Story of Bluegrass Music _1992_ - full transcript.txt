(introductory music) - Back in the days of my childhood in the evening when everything was still I used to sit and listen to the Fox hounds with my dad in the old Kentucky hills. (whimsical bluegrass music) I'm on my way back to the old home the road winds on up the hill, but there's no light in the window that shined long ago, where I lived. ♪ I hear a voice callin' ♪ ♪ It must be our Lord ♪ ♪ It's comin' from heaven on high ♪ ♪ I hear a voice callin' ♪ ♪ I've gained a reward ♪ ♪ On the land where we never shall die ♪ ♪ I hear a voice callin' ♪ ♪ I've gained a reward ♪ ♪ On the land where we never shall die ♪ - Things have really changed. They're not like they was back when I was real young. I'll never forget the old days, years and years ago when I was a little boy.

She'd go by the bed where she left her fiddle and pick it up and play a number, you know, an old time fiddle number. And that was just wonderful. - Across the South in Tennessee, Kentucky, Virginia and North Carolina, descendants of Scotch-Irish settlers played songs brought from across the sea. Old tunes like "Soldier's Joy", "Fair and Tender Ladies", and "Billy in the Low Ground" rang through Appalachia as they had for centuries in the British Isles. For families that toiled in cotton fields and coal mines, music was one of life's few enjoyments. - I remember folks gathered up in the evenings after they had supper, and a little radio that you'd listen to on weekends, but no TV, of course. And so we'd gather up and sing the old songs and exchange ideas and such as that.

Uncle Pen Vandiver was the first man that I ever heard play a fiddle and I believe I was about six years old the first time I ever heard him play. Well he got a wonderful Scotch-Irish sound out of it. He was a wonderful uncle, and he'd always bring the fiddle and we'd get to hear the fiddle after we'd have supper every night. We'd sit around the fireplace and he'd play the fiddle. And he played numbers like "Jenny Lynn", "Sally Goodin", "Going Across the Sea". Would you let me play one? "Going Across the Sea". (instrumental playing) We was always glad to have Uncle Pen he'd always come in on his horse, you know. Put the horse up there and feed him, but I could hear him sit out on the back porch and play that fiddle. Oh the people would come from far away, they'd dance all night 'till the break of day when the caller hollered "Do Si Do", we knew Uncle Pen was ready to go. ♪ Oh, the people would come from far away ♪ ♪ To dance all night to the break of day ♪ ♪ When the caller hollered "Do Si Do" ♪ ♪ You knew Uncle Pen was ready to go ♪ ♪ Late in the evening, about sundown ♪ ♪ High on the hill, an' above the town ♪ ♪ Uncle Pen played the fiddle, Lord, how it rang ♪ ♪ You could hear it talk, you could hear it sing ♪ - Monroe combined the old time folk music of his childhood with the fast paced rhythms of his world beyond his Kentucky home. In the late 1940's, Monroe's sound came to be called Bluegrass.

My brothers, they all went to the singing school in the church, but it wasn't no use me going 'cause I couldn't see the notes or anything, you see, and they couldn't learn me anything. So, I just decided that I would learn my music by ear and always do it that way. I was awful bashful when I was a kid growing up I just wanted to sing for myself, let me hear it. A lot of times out by myself, you know just walkin' 'round through the fields you know, doing work. Working with horses and cattle, and I'd be singing to myself, you know I didn't want nobody else to hear me because I didn't know whether they'd like me or not, you see. ♪ O Danny Boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling ♪ ♪ From glen to glen and down the mountainside ♪ ♪ The summer's gone and all the roses falling ♪ ♪ It's you, it's you, must go and I must bide ♪ ♪ But come ye back when summer's in the meadow ♪ ♪ Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow ♪ ♪ For you will bend and tell me that you love me ♪ ♪ And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me ♪ (explosion) - Oh, mercy. They cut all the timber off of this side of that mountain. Back then, it just more or less a wilderness. There hadn't been any timber cut in this country anywhere when this house was built. They built a railroad, and they cut timber all over this country. Hauled 'em down in here up to there on the train. (adventurous bluegrass music) - Southern industry changed more than just the land. It brought rural whites into contact with a new culture and a new kind of music. (rhythmic blues music) As the railroad cut into remote mountain hollers the hills echoed with the shouts of black laborers. ("Little Old Log Cabin in the Lane") The banjo had been played on plantations since the 18th century. It was brought to America by African slaves. Traveling minstrels played African rhythms with accents shifting to the off beat. These syncopated rhythms opened a new world of musical possibilities. (upbeat finish) Camp meetings rang with gospel spirituals. Hoedown's reel with bluesy fiddles. Throughout the South, African freighting styles mixed with Gaelic mountain melodies. - One time a good gentleman the name of Arnold Schultz, a Black man, come up here and visit us. He was a most wonderful guitar man that could play the blues that you ever listened to, that was Arnold Schultz. And he could also play the fiddle. One time he was up around Rosine, and they wanted us to play for a square dance there, so Arnold played the fiddle and I played the guitar. Now, you might not believe this but this is right, we started around sunset in the evening, and we was playing the next morning. (energetic bluegrass music) Later on when I was puttin' my music together I remember him, how he played the blues and everything, you know, so I was gonna add some blues to my music.

Gas was about fifteen cents a gallon then. Hot dogs was about ten cents. Pop was a nickel, and we played in stores or just anywhere we could play for whatever we could get. They didn't hardly have a guitar then. We played about anything we picked up. We used to play old tunes like "Cripple Creek", and "Mississippi Sawyer". So I'm gon' play one of the tunes right now called "Sourwood Mountain". Y'all ready? (bouncy folk music) - Old time folk music was transformed by outside influences. New instruments were mass produced and available from mail order catalogs. Their exotic sounds offered new musical combinations. Tunes once played by a solo fiddler were now accompanied by the Western cowboy rhythm of the guitar, the romantic plucking of the mandolin, or the sweet sounding slide of the Hawaiian steel guitar. At community gatherings musicians began to play and organize groups. These were the first professional string bands. - I got my first guitar when I was about twelve years old. It was quite an expensive model, the best that Sears had at that time, $3.95 I think, it came in a cardboard box, and it took me a year to get it in tune because nobody was around that knew how to tune it and finally a traveling minister came through holding a revival and he could play the guitar a little so he tuned it for me. They'd have, uh, lawn parties. Fundraisers, you know, for the schools and churches and things like that and three or four of us guys in the community our total pay was a free dinner if we could pick a little bit you know. ("Nobody's Love is Like Mine") - We used to have a talent contest once a year and they had the prizes for best fiddle player and singers and so forth, and so we entered as a duet and we won the first prize. I guess that was a big encouragement for us, although we won a bag of flour or something like that you know, it wasn't no big prize but back then it was. ♪ I want to be kissed but only by your lips dear ♪ ♪ For you're the only one who'll ever do ♪ ♪ I want someone to hug and call me honey ♪ ♪ I want to be loved but only by you ♪ - On Sundays, we'd gather 'round under a apple tree on side of a dirt road with find some boy with a mandolin or someone with a banjo, and we'd just sing there for two or three hours and people would stop by in cars and walk and we'd sing two or three hours to 'em and I remember many times before they'd leave they'd look at me say, "well Jimmy, you boys sing us one goodun 'fore we leave". ♪ Now don't forget me little darling ♪ ♪ while I'm growing old and gray ♪ ♪ Just a little thought before I'm going far away ♪ ♪ I'll be waiting on the hillside ♪ ♪ When the day you will call ♪ ♪ On the sunny side of the mountain ♪ ♪ Where the rippling waters fall ♪ ♪ My, my, Lord, Lord ♪ - Way back there when I was a boy, music was what I wanted to hear you know, and play it. My brothers, they wanted to play the fiddle and the guitar all that was left was a mandolin, so I started trying to learn it. I practiced a lot and learnt more about it, you see, heard other people play. As I got older, why, I got to where I wasn't so bashful I could play in front of anybody. (playful instrumental music) (applause) (energetic playing) - Back in them days, there wasn't very much to do. About all the entertainment that we had then was to maybe hunt, fish, or go swimmin'. They had a county fair once a year. When the fair came, the whole county turned out and it was somethin'. ♪ My gal's been tramplin' around ♪ ♪ Just about a week I know ♪ ♪ Several of my friends done told me so and so ♪ ♪ She found a new man. ♪ - Traveling shows brought a whole new world of sights and sounds to rural Southerners. Vaudeville singers crooned sentimental tunes from tin pan alley. Musicians brought early sounds of Jazz and Ragtime from the city. Itinerant preacher's offered eternal salvation through revival spirituals. Snake oil salesmen lured crowds with musical performers giving country musicians their first professional jobs. These amusements brought glimpses of the outside world and some had the magic to take you there. (seductive drumming) Talking pictures were larger than life. They flickered with images of the wild west and the lonesome singing cowboy. - It's the first guitar I ever had. It had Gene Autry on it, he was riding some big horses and there's ran up with him and I'd look at it many times but I always liked his singin' in movies. Gene Autry would start it out say, ♪ Been to the doctor ♪ ♪ Says I'm all right ♪ ♪ Know that he's lyin' ♪ ♪ Losin' my sight ♪ ♪ Should have examined the eyes of my mind ♪ ♪ Twenty twenty vision ♪ ♪ Walkin' round blind ♪ How'd we do it?

It was possible to hear operatic arias, Western swing bands, even Hawaiian songs. - My dad had one of the first phonographs in that part of the country with a collection of records and he'd let me sit down in a corner next to the old wood stove and play those scratchy records, you know. One I remember clearly, all I could hear, I don't think he knew more than a few lines of it and my mother didn't particularly like the song for some reason, but it was the old Vernon Dalhart, ♪ Oh, I wish I had someone to love me ♪ ♪ Someone to call me their own ♪ - Good morning friends and howdy neighbors, starting the program off with a little Ted Daffan ditty here this morning called "Over the Hill". - The radio filled the airways with music from far and wide blowing into the most remote mountain communities. (sultry blues music) (foreign operatic music) (big band music) (orchestral jazz music) The distant voices and far away sounds of the radio broke the boundaries of isolation, but more than music was transmitted. - This great nation will endure, will revive, and will prosper. The only thing we have to fear is fear itself. - By the late 1920's, depressed conditions forced thousands to leave the family farm. Those that remained faced the hardship of sharecropping on over-cultivated land. - My dad was a tenant farmer so to speak. At about 29, he was doing quite well, had a quite new Model-T truck was hauling on the highway he was doing very well. I also remember just as vividly the following year he couldn't afford to buy tags for it, and we had to move back to my mother's old home place which was quite an old house, possibly 100 years old, but it was home and we loved it. And that old truck sat behind the barn and rusted down. I drove a million miles in it, it's sittin' behind that barn, you know? - 1929, when you couldn't get a job and if you got a job, five or six dollars a week. - When I was a boy growing up, you could get a farmer for fifty cents a day, and now in '89, the best you can do is about five dollars a hour. That's right, you've heard your mother and daddy talk about them days I know, in '29 and '30, I'd say plenty of people in town starved to death. - They was! Oh yes, if we hadn't had our own cows and milk and butter and chicken and eggs and honey and bees... - My daddy was a mechanic at a Ford dealership and they cut the mechanic's down to nine dollars a week six days a week. You could hire a man out on the farm like this fifty cents if you had the money to pay him, if you didn't have the money to pay him, he'd take it in corn, meat, or potatoes, or anything. If you didn't work back then, you didn't eat. And us people in the country just did and survived and that was all.

So I'd never been in the cities you see, and I didn't know what it would be like I was really scared of it. A lot of country people there of course. A lot of 'em wanted to get off the farm, you know, 'cause that was hard work and they wanted to come into the city where they'd make so much each week. My brothers, they was already up North and they was moving down from Detroit down to Indiana, and they all wanted me to come up there so I decided to go.

Product manufacturers sponsored live radio programs directed at rural markets, where pitch-men delivered commercials between live musical acts. (quick-paced advertisement music) - Brought to you by Pet's evaporated milk, new Pet instant non-fat dry milk, and Pet-Ritz frozen pies! - Radio barn dances gave paying jobs to young musicians who worked in factories and played part-time string bands. - Yes siree friends, we gonna have to get some couples on the floor now and it's time for everybody to have a lot of fun, so get your partner and let's go to town. ♪ Everybody on the floor ♪ ♪ Swing her 'round and couple's soar ♪ ♪ Take your corner ladies hand ♪ ♪ Swing around she's lookin' grand ♪ ♪ Turn her loose and swing your own ♪ ♪ Round and round and stay at home ♪ ♪ First couple off and pick up Sue ♪ ♪ And learn to do that- ♪ - It was beyond my wildest dream to be in this business professionally and I thought I owed my folks more to try to do something business-like than to mess around the music business which really wasn't the most reputable thing to do at that time, most musicians were regarded as fellas tryin' to get outta work, you know? "When you gonna get ya a job, boy?" - We got on some stations up there in the Northern part of Indiana. The Monroe Brothers, you know, Charlie and me worked hard at it as a duet you see. Our first station we went on was WAE in Hammond, Indiana, in 1930. I was the first Monroe that went on a radio station. And then we went to Gary, Indiana on WJKS, and that stands for Where Joy Kills Sorrow, WJKS. We went from there onto Omaha, Nebraska. From there to Columbia, South Carolina. From there to Charlotte, North Carolina, Greenville, South Carolina, so, we done all right. - Howdy do everybody, from Nashville, Tennessee the heart of the Southland, your Grand Ole Opry. - In 1925, WSM in Nashville began to broadcast a Saturday night barn dance. The program featured a live stage show with burlesque comedy, flamboyant costume, and hillbilly string bands like "The Possum Hunters", the "Fruit Jar Drinkers", and "Uncle Dave Macon" the Dixie Dewdrop. ♪ Well the train pulled onto the very next stop ♪ ♪ I looked around about 17 cop ♪ ♪ Crawled to heel ye oughta seen me done ♪ ♪ Banga, banga, banga with my gatling gun ♪ Because of its' down-home atmosphere and satire of formal music, the program took on the name Grand Ole Opry, and became the most popular barn dance in the nation. A chance to play on the Opry was the dream of every aspiring country musician. - Well it's time to bank the fire and blow out the lights so we'll be back next Saturday at this same time with more of your favorite home spun fun and music. Thanks so much for listening, be good everybody. - I'd heard about the Grand Ole Opry all my life you know, and I wanted to give it a try see if I could get on there. So I went in there one Monday you know, Harry Stone, David Stone, and the Solemn Old Judge said they would listen to me. So I done about a couple of three songs and they said, "You start this coming Saturday night, and if you ever leave here you'll have to fire yourself." So I've been there, it'll be 50 years the last Saturday in October. - For this evening on the Grand Ole Opry, Bill Monroe and his Bluegrass boys. Let 'er go boys. (down paced musical rhythm) ♪ Blue moon of Kentucky keep on shining ♪ ♪ Shine on the one that's gone and proved untrue ♪ ♪ Blue moon of Kentucky keep on shining ♪ ♪ Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue ♪ - I always liked "Blue Moon of Kentucky" about the best. He's had it on awful good Bill Monroe has, he's always done my favorite. We used to set up the little radio (indistinct) Saturday night. He was a good entertainer. Everybody all around the neighborhood, they just keep on back to radio, we gang up the room full time, we'd make candy and we'd have a little party, you know? Little supper, stuff like that. Entertainment. - Monroe called his band the Bluegrass boys in honor of his native state of Kentucky. They were just a string band playing traditional instruments, but their high lonesome sound was unlike anything heard before. Monroe insisted that his boys wear suits and ties and adopt a solemn performance style that defied the hayseed stereotype. - I was proud of 'em the way that they was playing and singing, these old fine fellers. And they was young when they started with me, and they had a lot to learn you see, and being with Bill Monroe and the Bluegrass boys you wanted a chance to get in there and play. - When Bill Monroe hired me that was a big deal man that was what I'd been waiting to hear all these years. I was on the fiddle and I usually played all my stuff in easy chords, but he'd throw me into B natural and B flat and he figured out the little rookie country boy was scared to death so he really stayed by me. We had Lester Flatt on guitar, the late Lester Flatt and Lester was a good singer. He and Bill together made one of the finest duets that there ever was. This particular year that I was with him, the late Stringbean's was pickin' banjo for us. ♪ Hang on chillen' ♪ ♪ Well rabbit jumped up he looked mighty wild ♪ ♪ Dog took after him runnin' for miles ♪ ♪ Run little rabbit run run run little rabbit run ♪ - Stringbean played the old time banjo styles known as two finger or claw hammer where the fingers strummed down on the strings. - Bill come to me one night and he said, "Stringbean's has turned his notice in, we gonna have to find us a banjo picker." I said, "I know where one of the best in the country is, but he don't pick anything like String." He said, "Who is he?" I said, "Earl Scruggs." So we auditioned Earl in my room just a mandolin and banjo and fiddlin'. Boy, did he ever pick that thing, goodness gracious. - Earl Scruggs grew up in North Carolina where a different style of picking was made popular by minstrel performers. Scruggs added finger picks and plucked with a three finger rollover. He showered the music with syncopated notes pioneering a sound that became the hallmark for bluegrass. (jumpy banjo music) - Listening to Earl Scruggs, Lester Flatt, and Bill Monroe, I didn't even have a car I wouldn't go down to town on a Saturday night, and guy'd have his car sittin' there I said, "In about five minutes Bill Monroe and Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs and all them's gonna be on," and I said, "You care if I stand here would you turn it on for me?" And they said, "Yeah." Well what's real special about it, it was perfect. (rapid playing begins) - I wanted to pitch the music high, pitch it higher than anybody in the United States ever did. I put the drive in the music with my mandolin, that's where that drive come from. That would give the fiddle some work to do and that would be the most wonderful timing for the banjo in the world, is the time when I set bluegrass music to it. - Monroe combined musical sounds that were sacred and secular, urban and rural, hillbilly, ragtime, sentimental and blue. His music had a driving rhythm that was modernized and streamlined. (rapid instrumental ends) (applause) - We'd travel with a tent show out of Opry during the summer months. They're just like an auditorium where they, I believe they had 4,500 people. We had a ball team, uniforms and the works, it was good. We had a good team. We had some pretty good hitters, Bill was a good hitter. We'd get into town in the afternoon and I'd go find a young man and we'd say, "You got a ball team?" "Well we wanna dress you real good." Within a few minutes he would have a gang together and we would go at it. - We'd played a lot of good teams in Texas and Louisiana and won a lot of games, and each week we'd come in and announce who won and a little synopsis of what had been going on and announce where we was gonna be the next week. We'd do a little show at home plate, maybe an hour or something like that. Then kind of a twilight deal, you know, and then go into the ball game.

And so I decided I'd come down see the Grand Ole Opry. I met Bill Monroe and when he come out told him I'd listened to him all my life, so he asked me and I'd sing one with him. We sung and Bill said, "Well, if you'll go home and get your clothes, then just go to work with me." So that's the way I got hard by Bill Monroe. ♪ When the moon shines on the Blue Ridge mountains ♪ ♪ And it seems I can hear my sweetheart call ♪ Hard work, travel many a night through the sleet and snow with a bass tied on top.

During these years, Monroe shaped the talents of his musicians into a distinctive Bluegrass sound. - There had been so many Bluegrass boys, you know, I think around 65 or 75 fiddle players and the same thing in the banjo then a guitar and the bass. 'Course the same mandolin player's still with 'em today. - Monroe was the leader, but not the star. He called upon the Bluegrass boys to step up and take solo breaks like a jazz combo. Monroe encouraged each band member to develop their own style within his tight structure. - Bluegrass is like a school of music. Learn it right, learn the timing of it. Don't get it so fast that there's nothing there but just the speedin' of the music. Keep your timing right. The rhythm, the feeling of the music. It's got to be there. (energetic playing) (cheers and applause) - Following World War II, the impact of Monroe's music was felt across the South as string bands began to emulate his striking new sound. In 1948, Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs left Monroe to form their own band, the Foggy Mountain Boys. After Flatt and Scruggs departure, a wave of country musicians including former Bluegrass boys formed bands and carried on Monroe's sound. - If I'm a leadin' a sad song like something 'bout some woman has left a poor old broken hearted man, he's out some place drinking him a beer and crying about it, well when I sang that song to him, I sang it lonesome, and I'm kind of crying with him as far as my heart's part's concerned 'cause I feel for him, you see?

When we first left home to start playing music professionally, we used to do a lot of his songs until we began to write, and we just mixed it I guess and of course our sound is altogether different from Bill. - Well the Stanley Brothers was kindly, one of my first loves in bluegrass. Back home on the farm, about 11 or 11:30 everyday the Stanley Brothers would come on Farm and Fun Time WCYB in Bristol and I'd listen to 'em as a little boy. The songs that Carter Stanley wrote is just so good that he bound to have lived a real country hillbilly life and loved his folks from the songs he wrote. ♪ I went down the river I lay down to sleep ♪ ♪ I went down the river laid me down to sleep ♪ ♪ I went down the river I lay down to sleep ♪ ♪ I woke up, had shackles on my feet ♪ ♪ Takes a worried man to sing a worried song ♪ ♪ Takes a worried man to sing a worried song ♪ ♪ Takes a worried man to sing a worried song ♪ ♪ I'm worried now but I won't be worried long ♪ ("Wish You Were Here" by Harold Rome) - In the post-war era, Americans moved to suburbia and had the means to indulge in the blossoming consumerism. The record industry became big business as radio stations replaced live broadcasts with disk-jockeys who promoted hip records. - As bluegrass hit the best seller charts, Nashville began to promote the music. ♪ Roll muddy river roll on muddy river roll on ♪ ♪ I've got an ocean you're going to the ocean I long ♪ ♪ I've got a baby in Tennesse ♪ ♪ Who's long been awaiting for little old me ♪ - Bluegrass records were a hot commodity until a new musical phenomenon came out of Memphis. (Live performance of "Heartbreak Hotel") - One day you had everything going pretty good, then almost like overnight, as soon as Elvis really got on his feet and got going, why, everybody in the world was Elvis Presley and rock 'n roll crazy. (screams and cheers) - Elvis Presley took every fan from every kind of music. He took the fans away. - I mean I'm sorry he passed away, but I think his doings is foolish to me. That old foolish shakin' and rollin' and people are going to him and throwing their babies there and turning cars over, and pulling her clothes off and throwing them in his face that is foolish to me. - The electrifying sound of rock 'n roll turned Nashville upside down. The record industry scrambled to keep pace with the craze. - That rock 'n roll boom had come and a lot of the old time music people they had to quit, I guess you might say they starved out. - Elvis Presley was the big thing in the recording industry at that time, his type of music. Everybody was so jumping on the band wagon. We had to keep up with the current hit songs. ♪ He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack ♪ ♪ He sat beneath the tree by the railroad track ♪ ♪ Oh, the engineers would see him sitting in the shade ♪ ♪ Strumming with the rhythm that the drivers made ♪ ♪ The people passing by they would stop and say ♪ ♪ Oh my what that little country boy could play ♪ ♪ Go go ♪ ♪ Go Johnny go go ♪ (rock 'n roll guitar) - To compete with the sounds of rock 'n roll, country musicians electrified their instruments.

As musicians plugged into pop music trends, the acoustic sound of bluegrass became obsolete. ("White Lightning") - In Nashville, they had the packaged country shows all country, and they were electric and loud. That's where the money was, and so we decided that if probably, we would go to these shows and couldn't be heard by the time a person's hearing got back to normal we were off. We got to thinking that we could add amps to these instruments, and we could blow 'em away just like everybody else is doing. Bob even got to one point to where he was plugging his mandolin into the sound system itself. They hadn't heard this before. About 1967, we started using drums but the bluegrass people at that particular time they didn't want drums, they didn't want any part of drums, much less electricity. ♪ You ain't the kind of woman I wanted ♪ ♪ But you're the kind of woman I got ♪ - You see, if I'd have changed the people wouldn't have liked that at all so I was gonna stay with the kind of music that I wanted and loved and started with what I wanted to put together, and to keep the bluegrass pure, that's the way it's got to be.

(down tempo folk music) - They gathered on Cambridge street corners, sang at the Newport Folk Festival, played at coffeehouse hootenanny's, and by the 1960's, bluegrass was swept up in a folk music revival. - Flipping the dial on the radio one day I heard this sound. I said, "Whatever this is, I like this." And so I started to search you know, your radio dial to find more of this banjo, mandolin, this harmony singing, and I said, "That makes my adrenaline move." ♪ Way down in the Blue Ridge Mountains ♪ ♪ Way down where the tall pines grow ♪ ♪ Lives my sweetheart of the mountain ♪ ♪ She's my little Georgia rose ♪ The original bluegrass sound was a combination of certain acoustic instruments, but it's not just the instruments.

The flower children are drawn by the traditional bluegrass music of Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs and the Foggy Mountain Boys. The purity of their non-amplified string music is not diluted by any circumstance, not even by a psychedelic light show at the Avalon Ballroom. Several years back Earl Scruggs told a writer, "We're not about to forget that the core of our fans are people who get up in the mornin' and bake a lot of biscuits." And that holds today, although maybe not in San Francisco. - The folk revival created a wider commercial market for bluegrass. The music became part of popular culture through hit movies like, 'Deliverance', and 'Bonnie and Clyde' and on television shows where the hayseed image was exploited. ("The Ballad of Jed Clampett") Flatt and Scruggs career skyrocketed when the theme for the Beverly Hillbillies hit number one on the country charts. While they sang of hillbillies hitting it rich, other musicians sang about more serious concerns. ♪ Over there in Vietnam we brought another war ♪ ♪ Well I know and they know ♪ ♪ Just what we fightin' for in that war ♪ ♪ A crazy Viet Nam war ♪ ♪ Well I was a country boy I lived down on the farm ♪ ♪ Hadn't even killed enough to done a body harm ♪ ♪ 'Till that war ♪ ♪ That crazy war... ♪ At a time when many Americans were concerned with the nation's political and moral direction, the counter-culture sought music closer to the country's folk roots. - In the 60's, everybody in the world was tired of all the synthetic ridiculous things that was being forced onto 'em, and they all wanted to get back to the earth, back to the basics, and bluegrass music really helped take 'em there. ♪ Wish that I was on ol' Rocky Top ♪ ♪ Down in the Tennessee hills ♪ ♪ Ain't no smoggy smoke on Rocky Top ♪ ♪ Ain't no telephone bills ♪ ♪ Once I had a girl on Rocky Top ♪ ♪ Half bear the other half cat ♪ ♪ Wild as a mink but sweet as soda pop ♪ ♪ I still dream about that ♪ ♪ I've had years of cramped-up city life ♪ ♪ Trapped like a duck in a pen ♪ ♪ All I know is it's a pity life ♪ ♪ Can't be simple again ♪ ♪ Rocky Top, you'll always be ♪ ♪ Home sweet home to me ♪ ♪ Good old Rocky Top ♪ ♪ Rocky Top, Tennessee ♪ ♪ Rocky Top, Tennessee ♪ ♪ Rocky Top, Tennessee ♪ (dreamy bluegrass tune) - Bluegrass festivals began in the 1960's bringing together for the first time large groups of performers and audiences. Festivals became a setting for the masters of the music to teach young musicians who were experimenting with new material and new styles. - We liked folk music, we just liked every kind of acoustic we could find, So through reading about Sing Out! Magazine we discovered they were gonna have this bluegrass festival in Roanoke, Virginia. When we pulled up at the festival and we realized that it's 9am and there's tons of jamming going on, boy it's all we could do is just to get the car parked and get 'em out and find somebody to pick with.

We really enjoy to play here at Camp Springs. Now we'd like to do a song that was done by someone, you know, they called it 'Mocking Banjo', or some other one called it 'Mocking Marmalade' - That time bluegrass musicians had to search each other out so getting to see all these professional acts in one show was just overwhelming. ♪ You may not like my parents ♪ ♪ And you may not like my song ♪ ♪ Said you may not like the way I talk ♪ ♪ But you like the way I go on ♪ ♪ I'm a big horn man ♪ - When Ralph Stanley sang 'Man of Constant Sorrow' the whole place fell apart. ♪ I am a man of constant sorrow ♪ ♪ I've seen trouble all my days ♪ ♪ I bid farewell to old Kentucky ♪ ♪ The state where I was born and raised ♪ ♪ Ruby ♪ The Osborne Brothers were the rage of the festival. ♪ Ruby ♪ ♪ Honey are you mad at your man? ♪ ♪ If you don't believe I'm right ♪ ♪ Just call on me tonight ♪ ♪ Ill take you to your shady so cold ♪ ♪ Oh, Ruby ♪ ♪ Ruby ♪ ♪ Honey are you ♪ ♪ mad ♪ ♪ at ♪ ♪ your ♪ ♪ man? ♪ When the bluegrass festival started I just wanted to learn everybody's style. I'm just a second generation guy that had the good fortune to be influenced by all these people. But, Bill Monroe was the one that turned me on the most because he was the king of the bluegrass mandolin. The guy that started the whole style. (intricate chords playing) - Speaks to a lot of people the bluegrass music does. They can hear in the music, the feeling and everything they can, it's right there. And so that means a lot to the people all over the world and I'm proud of it. - Musical tradition that began by the hearth of Monroe's childhood home, is passed on today at bluegrass festivals around the world. There are festivals in Australia, Czechoslovakia, Holland, England, France, Germany, Italy, Switzerland, Japan, and many more. As Monroe learned from his Uncle Pen, new generations learned from the creators of the music to carry on the legacy of bluegrass. (celebratory bluegrass music) (cheering) - It's wonderful to be at the same festival as Bill Monroe, just to see the man who created this music that we're all enjoying so much. If it weren't for him we wouldn't be playing this music. Bluegrass for me is such a natural type of music. No faders or any kind of effects pedals on anything, it's acoustic and that's what really gets me into it. ♪ Hear a wind outside blowin' loud and strong ♪ ♪ Hear the mighty engines moan ♪ ♪ I'll be far from here when the sun comes up ♪ ♪ And a love that has grown so cold ♪ ♪ So don't follow me, don't follow me ♪ ♪ I'm bound to a place I can't recall ♪ ♪ I feel the big jets rise through midnight skies ♪ ♪ I'll search for the answers alone ♪ ♪ And wait for the time to go home ♪ It can be difficult to be a woman playing.

Bill Monroe for one, Ralph Stanley I'm a big fan of. I'd listen to them sing, and that's the only way that they could sing. They don't put anything slick in there, all you're hearing is the sound of their voice. When you hear them sing it's like they talk, and they have great words and great melodies. ♪ She lives all alone on a dark windy street ♪ ♪ In a room at the top of the stairs ♪ - In a 'Room at the Top of the Stairs', it's about this girl, she's done some things wrong in life she thinks maybe her boyfriend shouldn't take it too well.
