Hi, we should be on the list. My name is Theodora. And this is my sister Irene. We are the direct descendants of the first Olympians. Nope. We really should be on that list. [stammers] You please check. Every page. Wait until our ancestors hear about this. [Irene] I can't believe that was your best idea. It's almost as ridiculous as as when you pose as that sports agent to meet that quarter guy. Okay, punter. He was a punter, thank you very much and he was very cute.

Honey, we need to save very penny for law school. -And besides its best for you to stay in school until-- -The economy gets better, great. Precisely. Everyone I know from college is going abroad after graduating moment. -What do you do? -It's plans with money, Dora. You need to expand your social circle or network or whatever you call it. But Irene and I've been friends since we've lived in the city, Mom. How about something sweet? ...or run away. I'll go to Ohio Or go to Nevada or go to Singapore. But then I've to be a stowaway on that ship and that'd be really weird. But then I'll make a living from my... something, but then I'll become famous and then she'll be sorry. And I'll be set to do something big. And she'll show up and I won't recognize her. Right? And then I'll turn around and say, "Mom? what mom? I don't know what this woman is talking about, please take her away." -Dora? -What? You've gotta snap out of this. Yeah, so says the girl about to leave for South America.

Right here. -Oh, what a cutie. -Yes, she is cute. -And she is smart too. -Yeah. Her parents, my dad and his on-off, on-off, girlfriend, they don't make the time to take care of her. Oh, that's awful. Yes. So, otherwise, I would be gone... long time ago. But you've your music, Abbey, that's amazing, I mean, I don't have anything except... thoughts about being far away and doing huge things. -Hmm. -But, but how do I get from here to there. You know, like I feel like I'm in this... this old beige waiting room. [Abbey] Don't worry. Somewhere deal will creep up on you and it might not be huge but it fill massive. And the beige waiting room will just be a memory. [Dora] Hey, is that Nikki? Nikki? [Abbey] Whoa. [Dora] What you doing here? This is so weird. Hey, well, what are you doing here? We just made a sacrifice. Sacrifice? What kind of sacrifice? [Dora] It is in honor of Abbey's birthday. She's little upset that she's turning 30. I mean, she's upset because of, um, because of something else. Thirty? Oh, you poor little thing, you. In that case, you might just throw yourself in the river and get over with it. Thirty, believe me, it doesn't matter. Least until you get to be my age anyway. For instance, I just, I just finished this record. -Everybody says it's great. -Great. No, but see, great is over rated. You know what I mean? Really, where's the life in it, you know. I can't think the last time that I made a record that had a track on it. They had to... grow on the listener. When you listen to a new thing, something's not right, but then you listen to it again. And again and again. And slowly but surely it grabs and throws you in river. Now the Buddhists... Now Buddhists, the Buddhists have a saying that, whatever you do up until the age of 50, stop it and do something completely different. [laughs] Me, I'm little late on that one myself but-- But I thought you said that age doesn't matter. It's true. I'm talking about the work though, I mean, if you're not sweat and working hard at something then you're just not... living. [groans] On that note, it's time for this one to go. -[Nikki] To go home. -[Dora] Oh, oh, Nikki, Nikki [Nikki] I'm all right. Hi, Aunt Vera. Went to the lighthouse. Vera? Vera? Vera? Aunt, Aunt Vera? Are you all right? How long you've been out here? [Vera] I heard the train. This is nothing like it. Did you give him the letters too? Well, mostly... scribbled thoughts. That's when Theo did when he was gone. Once annually burned them. What's the use? I know 'em all by heart. Particularly one. "Dear Virginia. How are you? I can't continue. And all the places they would know, the people... the deadlines. Grab my hand. Like we used to. Jumping trains. And now, I'll pull you up. And we'll escape together." I don't have that letter. Because Theo never wrote it. You wanna travel, Dora. I'll give you the money. Okay, great. Because I don't want you here anymore. Degraw is interested in my journals. I wanted you to have the spotlight, not... what's your name. What feeble half big brain, do you posses? This says it's okay for you... [angrily] to just serve up my private moments on a platter to some complete stranger. [sobs] You gave him the originals. For God Sake, not even photo copies! Oh, God. ♪ Bye, Aunt Vera. [Dora] I know it was stupid, Mom. My bus gets in at two. The test, what about the test? Yeah, I'll take it in Newark. Bye. Please, get in, Dora. Oh, my God, I'm feeling so sorry, like the way I treated you, it was just no consideration for the other person. [stammers] I'm turning into my mom. I mean... Oh, God, [stammers] there's no respect for you or anything and I'm so sorry, I'll call The Graw and I'm sorry. Why do you have a trash can? What are these? Nothing, just... trash. What is they used to be? Some are, um... images from my dreams and others are just thoughts... it's junk, it's nothing, it's just throw aways. Well, they may be a bit rough but they are telling. A place where interesting things occur. You know, my poetry club? Oh, no, I can't read these. Oh, not the way they are right now, but you can work them. And read it at the festival. No way, no. If you read, I'll read. ♪ ♪ [Dora] Over and over... breaking the ice. Rocks, like blocks. Deep into mud. Thud. Blood. Crud. Enough with the rhyming. [Vera] How's the rhyme going? Awful, um, I mean, I... I feel stuff, you know, but it's not doing anything except just rolling around inside me. You're in a muddle. It's a worst place to be in everyday life but... best place to be for creativity. Listen, every writer that I know including your grand uncle, every writer has trouble writing. So, what did you do? You know, how our men, men have their muses. Well, a woman can have her muse too. Are you saying you had some affair with a big band musicians that helped you with your muddle. Oh, well. I didn't necessarily say affair, but... Well, I was always editing and... always writing articles and nobody wanted to publish. So, I needed a little attention. A lively conversation, you know. Theo, oh, he was off on his missions. So, I was off on mine. So to speak. We're so much alike. [laughs] [soft piano music playing] ♪ Who wants something sweet? Beautiful. Before dinner? All right. -For you. -Thank you. Thank you. Ladies. [Vera] Mmm. Oh, thank you. [Dora] So this is the recipe from the kitchen of Mr. Henry Miller. Of course with some improvisation by Aunt Vera and me. What onions? Among other things. Isn't they yummy? The Kalamata olives were a really good addition. Dora, remind me to find a book, one of my favorites, Lawrence Ferlinghetti I think you're gonna find his work to your liking. So, should I quiz you to prep for the test mark? No, you should not. What kind of law do you want to her to practice? Oh, well, I was thinking trial because of the theater of it and she's always being so dramatic. But I don't know, what were you thinking, Dora? Tax. Is there a time to a poem? No. A poem... has to snake its way out of you. And become the length, it becomes. [clears throat] That sounds uncomfortable. -[Vera] It can be. -[Dora] It can be. I gonna check on dinner. [Helen] Excuse me, honey. Thank you. A drift of days have passed me now. I've got so much more to think about. Deadlines and commitments. -What to leave in and what to leave out. -Mom. [Dora] You don't think on Vera's been acquainted with the great poet Bob Seger. Oh, I love that song. I wish I didn't know now. What I didn't know then. [Vera] Against the wind. [Helen] Against the wind. Still runnin' against the wind. [Helen] See that? Smarty pants? Anyway I'm just trying to make a point, I'm not as insensitive as you think I am. And when you're making six figures, you can donate your time and money to a local poet's group. Isn't that right? Well, if... That's the path she wishes to take. Well, it should be. I mean, look at you and me. Where did purview, where did our heart take our fears, huh? Down under the pit, where it aches. Seldom comes up for air. Well, I can't argue with that. So, put off pleasure for a while, knowing that all down the line, it's gonna rear it's... Lil' luxurious and lucrative head. -Job, money, life, that's the order, Mom? -That's right. Is that what you told dad? -Can I have one of those? -Oh, yes, dear. [Helen] I mean, where's the glamor in starving? I guess, it's makes you skinny and that's fashionable. And okay, we were passionate and starving. But then, you came and... everything changes. Everything. So... So, dad's career wasn't good enough for you. Your parents had the same career. Hot glue and lumber, God, I miss that smell. For constructing sets. But... but getting a real job and moving to Jersey that must've stressed dad out and probably contributed to his heart attack. [Vera] Your father didn't die from a heart attack, Dora. He fell off a scaffold and died instantly. What? I wasn't' there. Before I left. Danny was going on and on about this. Unusual and extravagant set. Why did I leave, right? I can't remember all, so foggy now. But I came back and I... I couldn't see him. In the first I thought it was because of the... my eyes. Going from sunlight into darkness it's always hard adjusting. So, I want a... beside I were like... kept, trying to find him up there. And then I knew... He was on the floor, he was...[sobs] No way... I was going to tell that to my lil' girl. Heart attack, heart attack, heart attack, that was it. End of story. -So, how was it, honey. -It was good. Why the heck, do you this? Frozen Garden. The festival starts in an hour. [whispers] Let's go. [announcer] Well, the moment, we've all been waiting for... She founded the Saugertie's Poetry Club, twenty years ago. And as passionate as Vera Maxos has been and helping others with written and spoken word, we have never heard her speak. Oh, lucky us, tonight she takes the stage. Vera. -[man] Yeah, Vera. -[all clapping] I... am an old fool. Which is not as appealing as when I was young fool. But you know, I think, it's all worth it. I think. And luck is still on my side. Because I have a chance to spend time with my great niece. And she is great. And together, with Degraw. We are going to knock that book Paradise off the shelves [applauding] And Dora... I want to thank you. To reintroducing me to my muddle. Because sometimes in life... this all we have. This poem is called All the things. "Snow is general over the cat's skills. Garden waits for me... like a lover. Contained lush, yearning... never satisfied. Train! You took me here and there. Ice cold bear. You didn't really care. You just continued on. Home! You'll go into other hands. And they'll soon know, you're creeks and shadows. And your flaky walls... in the cobwebs that hang. I grew comfortable and you grew quiet. You! In and out. In and out. You never may steal my heart. How I've loved you too much. Theodor, Edda, Vinius, Betty, Danny. Mother, father. Snow... is general over the catskills." Thank you. -[Dora] I like that. -[Vera] You think? [Vera] Love you. -Where you going? -I can't do this. No, I can't do this. It's crazier. What's your problem? You nervous? Everybody gets nervous. You never hear that Janis Joplin threw up before every performance? All right, so that something to do with the amount of whiskey she drank, but... Nevertheless, remember what I was telling you at the river. At least trying to tell you down by the river. I want to you take that one energy that's inside you that needs to come out. And throw it at the audience. Be a thunderbolt with words. Make a collision between you and them. Or... you could bail. [Dora] Sorry. I'm nervous. This poem is called Frozen Garden. And it is dedicated to my Aunt Vera. "Nature is sometimes cruel to the seeds we cast. But some seeds pick up the wind and warm. Dad. I see you smiling atop this structure of your happiness. Painting the future of your dreams... you left behind. I'm here now, step by step, moving on the set, you helped create. I want to sing my song. Loud and Proud. But my brain makes the tune of fog muddle. The heart is my mostly companion, traveling along a path not weeded with ease. Beats on as it quivers. It's vocals sometimes faint. I was only ten when you took a misstep and didn't understand why you left. Where... your heart did not attack. And I don't see you falling. I see you finally able to fly. You were brave, Dad. And I'll be too. Thank you. [applauding] [Dora] Well, I wasn't exactly a thunderbolt with words. But I'm struck by two extraordinary thoughts. Everything fabulous... is not so far away from me. And I understand why my mom wants me to go to law school.
