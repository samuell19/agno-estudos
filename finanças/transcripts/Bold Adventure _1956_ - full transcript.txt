With heretics! - They perform peacefully ... Isn't that the main thing? Let the blood stop flowing! This pleases God; your king will benefit from this too. He hesitates, but would rather swear allegiance to His Majesty ... - God does not want it! Tell me, you are Fleming! .. You know it better than we do! - You will find out on the day of the oath! This world is against Spain! - They are all at the same time against us! Nobles, artisans, merchants, peasants - everyone is attacking our soldiers! The whole country is ready to rebel against us! Clear dawns will rise (sings a Flemish song) over the fields of our land ... (sings a Flemish song) - To arms! Our soldiers are ready to crush any riot! This music....

It's disgusting to look at you - thin as a cuckoo. - Eh Nel, my Nel ... How long have I seen you ... (poet...) - They will all go to swear allegiance to the Spanish king ... Prince of Orange the first ... - Orange will go to Albu only to declare independence! And the wolf will only grind its teeth! What beautiful music it will be! “Do you like music, Lamm? Let's go to! - To Albu? You're out of your mind? - Crazy ... fool ... Why not? Clear dawns will rise ... (sings) - What a soothing music ... See how quickly your wife has tamed our new buffon. Captain Juan ... - It's simple: she drove me crazy. Oh heaven! her husband! “Here is the merchant from Damme that I told you about. - Monsignor, His Majesty Philip II sent us for indulgences. “This is one of the most valuable whistleblowers of the heretics, monsignor. - I made a list of those whose souls can still be saved, the rest I sell indulgences. I need a lot of indulgences, I would like to buy the entire issue from you. 10 florins per pike. - 50 - 15. - 40 - 20. - 30 - 22. - It goes. - Okay, now I'll sell you everything. "Everything is ready, Monsignor." - Everything is in its place. Today everything will be cleared up. If the Prince of Orange and his friends refuse to swear allegiance to the king, I will have to talk differently with this insolent local nobility. The rebels will lose their leader ... I will level the country to the ground ... “The invitees have come, monsignor. - Let them in. And if they are traitors to Spain, What are you going to do? - When they come out after the ceremony, if you order, I lead them at the head of my cavalry. Disguised as Flemings, you will infiltrate a group of rebels. - I will knock over the statue of the Virgin - And I will spit on it ... - They will be arrested for sacrilege. - Give me their papers. - Hold, monsignor. - I added a list of the leaders who raised the villages to riot. - Good. Damme ?! It seems that this merchant from Damme ... Call him. I want to know who this Till is. I was told that he attacked my soldiers. “He’s not so smart as they say about him ... However, no one saw him, he keeps his distance. He avoids danger ... Devilry! The devil encourages heretics! Who's there? - Jester. - Did you overhear us? - I listened to the swallows. - I listened to the wolves sing ... like owls sniffle in their sleep ... The swallows said: "Til, Til, where is Til? Til is everywhere!" - Do you know Thiel ?! - Hmmm ... I saw him. - What is he like? - He looks a little like me ... "Monsignor!" A merchant from Damme came. - Do you know Thiel? - ABOUT! - Let him choose: loyalty to the king or death! - Til! This jester! .. it's Till! ... I confirm under oath, that I am ready to serve His majesty, always be faithful to him and always be submissive to his almighty will. Gentlemen, swear! Mr. Prince of Orange, swear by the sword! - Gentlemen, let me pass ... I swear. - I swear. - I swear. Those who consider themselves deceived by Spain can join us. There is still time. Gentlemen, you are welcome! We princes of the provinces we ask you to turn to His majesty on our behalf, asking for the return of independence to our lands. - Independence ?! Independence?! What does it mean?! Aren't you free? - Free ?! "always be submissive to the almighty will" - the will of a foreign king! - His Majesty Philip II is our king! And you! And he will remain with them! “The Flemings want to be ruled by the Flemings! - Well! have arrived! All powers of power, all attributes of supreme power belong exclusively to the Spanish crown! And your prince, fighter for independence, you see! wants to be the ruler! He wants to take my place! Sit down, Mr. Prince of Orange! The place is still warm. - It's burning! - Go, gentlemen. Without Spain, you are beggars! unfortunate geuze! - Beggars ?! - Yes! - We went broke serving Philip II! We only have our blood and our swords left to serve Flanders! - We are proud that we are Geza! - Long live Geza! Monsignor, there is no harvest without the poor Gez. And since there is no harvest, there is no tribute. There is no army without tribute. And without an army there are no rulers. And the country would not have the happiness of loving you. - Do you doubt the mood of the people of our country? The state meeting will introduce you to them. - State Assembly ... Assembly of states is prohibited! This is sacrilege! - The meeting will take place! If necessary, we are ready to fight! - I tell you, it's Till! Monsignor must be warned! it's him! This jester! - Fool ... not a fool ... He dressed up as a fat cook! I need to come in! AND! keep it! Hold on! Keep it! They had to answer with a squeaker! The bullet is crying in Orange! Pishchal! Take it, monsignor. - Orange will now pass under the window, and you will swat him like a sparrow. - We forge weapons ... - Well? Oh ... he's already gone ... gentlemen don't know how to shoot ... Look, he must not have gone far ... Oh! beer in barrels ... ... It's not difficult, monsignor. In the old days I shot at titmouses ... It was a time of crazy youth ... Goodbye handsome. Now the jester will show you. Long live Geza! ... An open struggle for independence has been going on for 15 months. There is a war going on. The prince has gathered a professional army hired soldiers. We defend the case of Gezov. On the battlefield, Steel Hand ... he is as strong and stubborn as 30 bulls. Within months, the Spaniards were disorganized. Entire squads drop their weapons. Reinforcements are coming from Madrid. Duke Alb wanted to suppress the riot and prevent Orange from collecting staffs. ... Under the onslaught of superior enemy forces, the people of the Steel Hand almost surrendered ... But from farms, from villages, cities and from the forest, Geza came running to the call of the prince. The enemy is occupying the country. But Geza doesn't give up. - Go ahead, Geza! And here are the soldiers of Orange. ... On the shore of Esco the Liberation Army is preparing to cross. The enemy is very strong in the south ... On the other, on the north side, the Prince of Orange prepares to reassemble the states. This is the march towards independence. The power of the Spanish king must be overthrown. The bridges over the Esco are burned ... the river is deep ... it doesn't matter! Wouldn't a soldier, be he a mercenary or a Guez, risk his life and try to get to the other side? Anywhere in the provinces, army recruiters will tell you on behalf of each city, every village, from every spikelet in the fields, on behalf of our lost compatriots: a free man must triumph! a man ready to fight for Flanders! join the Prince of Orange! This is what these low sheets dare to tell you. Here's what you would do if you read them. - Really, father? - Yes Yes. Yes-yes ... That's why we burn them! The Holy Inquisition is your dear mother! To save your souls, we burn your books! Don't read! keep emptiness in your heads! We think for you! - Really, father? - Yes Yes. As you read, different thoughts will come to your mind! Thoughts of independence, for example! And you will want to join the Gez army! - The monk says ... like Til ... - All of you! .. do you want to join Orange? He will help gather delegates from all provinces! The state meeting will take place! Orange needs me ... I want to go to him! but who will guide me? Look around you ... Look left, look right ... Yes! Yes! He will lead you with him! This is what is happening in all our villages! This is what would have happened if we hadn't been here to steer their reading in the right direction. Isn't it, father? - Yes Yes Yes Yes. Better read the promises of the Duke of Alba! I reward the one who kills the prince of liberation with gold and all kinds of honors. Here's what to read! You don't use it! In 15 months, not a single killer among you! incredible! - Come here, son! There is a work! - Again ?! I don't have a hundred hands. You need to inflate the furs ... and run with Thiel everywhere to agitate in the army of the Ghezes for Orange ... Poor Nelle told me to keep an eye on him ... and then do it and do this ... tear them apart ... for a pot of oatmeal ... - You can talk, my fat man ... Orange needs us, we need him ... The country is not saved with a belly, but with courage and then ... Well, if you're so tired, go to sleep already. I AM?! sleep?! Sleep... - If you read, you would think! - Spaniards! Let's rise! against these hypocrites! They make us burn books that contain the truth! All the smart people understood me ... Really, father? - Yes, yes. - Til! "Captain Juan!" (Spanish) (more Spanish) “He says the Spanish army is coming; tomorrow she will attack Orange. - Attacks tomorrow? (more Spanish) - We must warn Orange! now! Where is Til ?! - Hurry! - Steel Hand Traitor! I'll put him on a bayonet up to his beard ... And we will go in a carriage! - To get to the shores of Esco before the Spaniards, you have to spend the night on the road ... - You will sleep tomorrow! - If Orange is forced to fight by the river, he is gone ... - Need for the Steel Hand and his men to cross ... - I keep my word that they will cross. - Til, you are careless ... - Shh, look, you are about to take off like a butterfly! ... - Dumb ones! idiots! (in spanish) - They were not paid ... “They don't want to fight anymore. - They yearn for their homeland ... - They complain ... - So many soldiers against Orange tomorrow ... - It cost them dearly ... - In Vetelem, all the rebellious were hanged ... - Poor things ... - What are they singing about? They sing: "a woman returns from the fields ... God! Under the blue sky, the white house is empty ..." "Where is my beloved? .." "men in war ..." "Who is going to cut the golden ears now? .." - Drink? - Gracias, mama. (thanks, mom, Spanish). - Spot, grain ... this Flemish seed ... (more Spanish) - Why, soldier? - Why the war? - No sé. (I don't know, Spanish) - You do not know? - Not. - Listen! - The people of the Duke of Alba are everywhere ... Tomorrow the fate of the country will be decided on the banks of the Esco. - A woman returns from the fields ... (words of a Spanish song) the white house is empty ... where is my beloved? - He's somewhere in the night ... sings for you ... and for your country ... - Til ... ... - Steel Hand! Steel Hand! Do you hear me?! Command your people to cross! - Not! My people are soldiers! not fish! - You're right! - Prince of Orange on the other side! he's going to take the bridge. When he takes it, it will be possible to cross to the other side ... - Orange will be against! (from afar) - A soldier who wets his heels is a lax trash! - Underpants! - Orange paid us for the war, and not for the fact that we sip water! This is not included in the contract! We need money! The Gezas are fighting for independence, so let them urinate! And we ... we are fighting for money! Geuze again? - Steel Hand! - The Steel Hand is me! Well! what are you waiting for?! we must cross to the other side! Geza Go North! Orange wants to have a state meeting there. The Spanish King will no longer be above us! We will be independent from Spain! Are you chilling here ?! - Don't worry, I am a professional soldier, I fought for 30 years. - My soldiers got their feet wet ... - But Alb will smash you to dust if you stay here! Our army needs you! - Idiots! - Leave it to me! - What?! wet your heels ?! Wet ?! Yes?! Right now I will grind your stupidity! Over there in that mill! I will rinse your mustache there and your pieces of iron! I'll wash all your lice right now! Lamm! Come gallop to the mill! Watch out, Till! Goodbye my dear keg ... Til! Til! look! here he is! Wipe your eyes! - There are 12 of them! “But there are two of us. - Yes-yes .... ... - What is it with me? .. (surprised at his bold act) - After you, senor lousy dog. - Oh! Caution... ... -Til! drive up ... where are you there? - Hey! lousy dog! get out! Go! come here! Now let's go swimming! - Not! let me get off! - Why are you laughing ?! Idiots! Cross over! all into the water! in water! The army needs us! Duke Alb will blow you to the ground if you stay there! (from afar) Orange will put you on trial! Who does not want to be hanged! Forward! ... - Crossing! - Crossing ... crossing ... - You will pay me for everything, heretics! I will sprinkle your blood on Flanders! Dagger! The Spanish dagger will keep this land for the king! Who is ready to strike a heretic ?! For the dagger! - Who are you? You made my people cross the river ... - I am Til, the son of Claes, who died for faith and freedom. - You are full of courage and cunning as a fox. Claes's ashes hitting my chest. “Look, we want to have a state convention in the north. Go back to where you came from. The southern provinces may already be suffering under the bloody duke's boot. Go through Namur, through Flanders, through Anvers; from Bruges to Brabant and declare everywhere that independence is at hand. In a few months, the State Assembly will relieve our lands of Spanish tutelage. On behalf of the oppressed peoples, I will break the royal seal. - Well done! oh well done! bravo, prince! "God help you, Monsignor, in the fight against those who kill in his name. - Go. ... - Lord, hatred has permeated our land ... Lord, drive the violent people away from us. Lord, take our country under your holy protection ... - Well, here we come to Damm. I was hoping to rest there ... - We cannot stay at home, when the prince is in danger ... - You won't even sigh? See Nelle ... get some rest in Damme ... Here is your suffering and your love. How nice it would be for us there ... Oh Damm! about the village! my heart flutters! Don't be discouraged, Lamm! You are silent ... Nothing moves you ... even the memories of poor Claes and poor Sotkin ... Have you turned to stone? .. Look at me! how I tremble with excitement! Oh my friend ... ... - She's pretty, this baby. - Really, Mr. Burmister? - Ten florins for a boissot. (boissot is an ancient measure of bulk solids = 12.5 liters) Divinely, you will not say anything ... - If you find my price for grain too high, buy from others ... - You have captured the entire crop ... - Speculator ... - Speculators eat beans ... - And this Nel ... is her mother a heretic? - You will be disappointed: she is poor. If you hit it, you won't get three liards. - You're right. Plus Gesa is everywhere, you need to be careful. I took a great risk when I betrayed the one who printed these bibles ... “But it brought you 600 florins. - And yet she is sweet, this Nel ... Very good looking ... - The country eats the bread it has suffered ... So spring is already beginning to nest in the snow ... When the trees are bare, without foliage, do not forget that they bloomed ... Nel, do you think about your springtime suitors? - Yes, Mom. - The month of May will return soon, my daughter. - Til! "Nel!" - Til! I thought you would never come back ... - Don't cry, Nel ... sweetheart.... - I've been waiting for you ... - I walked towards you. I saw weapons and blood ... and now I see your pretty face, your eyes, your light ... you... - Oh, you're here ... You are here ... I didn't know where you were ... I was scared... I hoped... And for good reason: you are here ... No, no, I don't cry anymore ... Do you remember our May? I ran in the grass ... I called you ... You ran to meet me ... You shone like the sun ... you laughed heartily ... I laughed too ... we were together ... Are you here! as if you never left! - I so wanted to see you ... But I cannot stay. - AND! Til! - But why? “Thiel and I are helping the prince. We beat the Spaniards all over the south ... like crazy ... Not alone, with Gezamy, of course. Thiel and I stopped by for a while ... We cannot stay. “I don’t want to part with you. Be careful. - I'll be back. We are together... always, everywhere ... - Til! Til in the village! Beware! Til in Damme! He is back! (from afar) Til in the village! For help! Til in the village! ... - He is dead? Yes, dead ... mertv ... yes, yes ... - Did you just yell? How many times have you betrayed your brothers ?! Wolves share prey in the snow ... Listen! .. listen! .. Hear the voice coming from the village. This is a cry of suffering! Listen! Hear our mother Flanders cry. She's not having fun anymore. She is crying. - Til ... that's all I have ... for you ... for Gezov ... I give you everything! gold!.. - Gold... How much gold do you need for my long-suffering mother Sotkin? and for Claes, my father's burnt? for the bread that you snatched from children's hands? for hunger? for tears? for the ashes rotting under the snow? for suffering and justice? for our villages and our land ?! How much gold do you need for your country ?! Merzavec! Beware! - No, no ... not true ... Till! not! not true! Til! Leave me alone! (from afar) - Til! - The whole country is against us! Flanders is like its women. She trembles in our arms. She wants to break out of our embrace and surrender herself to the Prince of Orange. Dagger! I need a Spanish dagger to keep this land for the king! - I'm going to kill him. - You, Juan? Where are you from? - From Avila, monsignor - From Avila ... beautiful poor noble Castile ... Our Spain, warmed by the sun ... by God, we need fertile land ... grain, feed, bread ... “I know, monsignor. I will go and kill the Prince of Orange. - Go, son! - I will order to provide you with an escort. - Geza is everywhere, I'd better go alone. So I am more confident in a successful outcome. - Prince heretic. - Killing him, you will go to heaven. His hand will be ruled by an angry god. When you see his filthy hand rise to smash the symbol of royalty, you will kill him! "Yes, Monsignor." “The prince considers himself safe in the north! surrounded by provincial delegates! behind the backs of their soldiers! beyond the thickness of your walls! But you will kill him! and Geza will scatter like rats! We will destroy them! Flanders will remain loyal to the church and his majesty! ... - I found time to play the fool! put on your helmet! Watch out, patrol! - Hurry, Kayes, hurry! - Do you think they are Spanish? - (Spanish speech) - But-but ... (no-no) Si-si ... (yes-yes) - (in Spanish) - Si-si-si ... (more Spanish) Look! It's him! (more Spanish) - Yes ... yes ... - Til! - Geza follow me! Shoot him! he wants to kill Orange! Soldiers of the Duke of Alba! .. Wait for me! ... For help! ... (more Spanish) (muttering in Spanish) ... We, the representatives of the provinces, decided as it is clear to everyone, that subjects were not made for the pleasure of the king! and to serve him like slaves! on the contrary, the king is the king for his subjects! he must rule his subjects fairly and love them as your children! And since it does not require proof that the king of Spain Philip II, treated us, his subjects, not like a father but how ungrateful, like a thief! like a robber, murderer, executioner! with the weapon of justice, we will smash the symbol of royalty! We, representatives of all provinces, from south to north, we stand for peace, for the right of everyone choose your faith, and declare Philip II a scoundrel and a tyrant! On behalf of the law we demand depriving him of his powers! On behalf of the long-suffering people we demand depriving him of his powers! On behalf of all provinces, we demand that the King of Spain, Philip II, be deprived of his powers! ... - Til! - Nel! Catch up!
