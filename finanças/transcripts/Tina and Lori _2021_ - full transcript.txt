Okay, okay. So do you guys honestly believe that there are modern day love stories like "Porgy and Bess" or "Romeo and Juliet"? - [Rachel] I mean, yes. Look at movies like "The Notebook" or "Love & Basketball", and our times is better because these people didn't actually have to, you know, die. (class laughs) - Those was cool, but I like love stories like the Joker and Harley Quinn. (class disagrees) - [Rachel] You can't possibly be serious to call their sick, twisted lives, a love story. - Why not? She loves him so much that she basically gave her life for him. - Yeah, which was kinda stupid. (offscreen student agrees) - [Lori] Was it stupid? - [Teacher] Excuse me, Lori. I can't hear you, can you speak up? - I said, was it really stupid? Yeah, we all know she jumped in petroleum for the joker, but I also believe she know the Joker didn't care about anything or anyone but himself. So when he jumped in after her, he was also proving his love for her. That he couldn't live without her. - [Female Student] Preach! - So, no matter how sick and twisted their love may have been, it was their love. - [Different Female Student] Who she talking to? (class laughs) - Okay, and what would be one of your favorite love stories? - [Lori] Hmm. Mickey and Mallory. - [Teacher] From the movie, "Natural Born killers"? - Mmhm.

I made sure I packed my birth certificate and my social security card 'cause I don't want no problems. And I mean, he was gonna flip his shit anyway, once he found out that I enrolled myself into EDU, and you and I was gonna be roommates? (Christina sighs) I mean, I haven't really dealt with him, L. - Yeah, you right about that one. - Might as well get it over with now. It's better to get it over with now rather than later. So I can just start my college career in peace. But, um, do you think it's cool if I kick it at your house tonight, then go to my aunt's house in the morning? - Duh! You know you my girl.

That you shoot him? - [Lori] Yes, in self-defense! He was whooping your ass! - [Christina] Yeah, my ass! He was beating you too? And where did you get the gun? Right, you didn't think about that, now did you? - All right, T, damn! (Christina slams on car panel) - Man, I hate him! He's going to ruin my life! - [Lori] He's not, T. Look, calm down. Um. Look, we can just get a room tonight, and we can chill there, and we'll just figure out everything in the morning, okay? Okay? - [Christina] Okay. - I got you. (somber piano music plays) T, I'm sorry for killing your dad. Getting you into all this mess. - I'm not sorry that he's dead, L. I'm just sorry that you're the one that did it. He wasn't that great of a husband or a father. (Christina sighs) I just didn't understand how my mom could die and leave me here with him. Like, she knew that he was terrible. And the day after her funeral, that sick fuck comes up behind me in the kitchen with a hard dick. I tried to look past it because he was drinking a little more. But then shit just got worse. He would whisper in my ear and say little nasty shit, or hug me and not let me go. I had to cook and clean everyday in that house. That's why I loved coming to school. School was like my escape. You and I, all we've ever talked about was going away to EDU together. And when that, when that fucker told me, that I had to stay home and take care of him, it had me hot. Then you, when you told me, that once I turned 18, I could enroll myself into EDU. I was relieved. I felt free. I felt like a new woman. Then (Christina sobs) this fucker comes, and gets shot and dies? - T, you good? - No, no L, I'm not good. I'm not good, L. He's taken my life. He's taken my life, and he still wins.

Look, can you just cut the fake shit, and put the cops on the phone? - Hold on, little hoe, listen. Excuse me. - Hey, Tina. - Oh shit. Guys really are. Yes Tina we are. And is Lori with you? - [Christina] Yeah, she is. - And are you guys safe? - [Christina] As safe as we could be. - So to ensure you that you ladies stay safe, why don't you meet me down at the DTW precinct, so we can all talk about what's going on. - [Christina] Why do we come to the precinct to talk? We're talking right now. - Well, discussing what happened at the precinct will make it better for everyone, and definitely you young ladies. It'll be as if you're turning yourselves in, and both of you- - [Christina] Turn ourselves in? Turn ourselves in for what? - Your father was shot and killed last night at the party. You girls do know that, don't you? - [Christina] Yeah, I kinda heard about it on the news this morning. - So, would you like to come into the precinct and talk about it? - [Christina] No, not really. We could talk about it right now. - Okay. So why don't we start with you telling me exactly what happened? - [Christina] Yeah, I don't know. You don't know. So you weren't at the party last night? - Yeah, I was there. But then me and Lori kinda left early. - Okay. You know, uh, I'd prefer if you guys would come down to the precinct so we can finish talking in person. Can I at least get you to take my number? Just in case one of your young ladies changes your mind. - [Christina] Yeah, that's cool. - You have something to write with? - [Christina] Yeah - All right, my cell is 248-555-1353. Christina? Did you get that? Christina? - [Christina] Yeah. - Look, Christina, murder's a very serious matter, and I don't want to see you young ladies get in any more trouble. So we all need to sit down and talk about what happened because your father was shot twice with the same gun. So I know only one of you, young ladies pulled the trigger. So let's all sit down and talk about it before it's too late for either of you. - [Christina] Detective Byrons, can you do me a favor? - Yes, what is it, Christina? - Find my father's murderer, and don't ever in your life, call me Christina again. - [Lori] Bro, what did he say? - He wants us to come down to the precinct and turn ourselves in. - Shit, shit, shit. (door slams) All right, look, T, if you want, I can just go down there- - No. No, Lori. We are in this together, you go that? Period. - [Lori] So what's our next move? - I don't know But I know, if we go down to that precinct and turn ourselves in, we're going to jail. - [Lori] All right, let's go. - [Phone Salesman] Here you go, bro. - Bro, peace out. - [Phone Salesman] Peace out. Hey, how you ladies doing? - Hi. - Hello. - Um, can I get a phone? - What kind of phone you looking for? iPhone? Android? - You. I mean, do you have like a burner or a minute phone? Anything of that nature? - Aye, haven't seen a man on the minute phone. - [Phone Salesman] Y'all like a couple drug dealers or something? What y'all gonna do with a minute phone? Y'all, like, talk all day. - [Lori] Do you have the phones or not? - Yeah I got one right here. (drawer creaks) See, this what you need. This one come with 60 minutes. - [Lori] Perfect. How much is it? - $49 out the door. - [Lori] We'll take it. All right, give me a just second, let me activate it. - [Lori] (Lori gaps) Wait, we can't be like tracked or anything, right? - Tracked like, your location? - Yeah. - What y'all girls into? - [Lori] We got a little something going on, but I go to school with Moe. Syed, he says he's your people, so I thought you could hook us up. - [Phone Salesman] Y'all ain't the police or nothing, right? 'Cause if all y'all are, you have to let me know. - Yeah, I don't think that's how that works, but no, we're not the cops. - [Phone Salesman] All right, so this one isn't gonna be $49. See this phone, it can't be tracked. It's good because it doesn't have a plan, and it doesn't store as much info. So what you need is a burner phone, so the connection doesn't bounce off the towers. - Yes, how much is that one? - About $300 out the door, and that's the deal. - What? $300? We ain't got no $300. - [Phone Salesman] Then what y'all got? - Um, can maybe you like do it for half? Please? - Please? - I'll see what I can do. - Look, donkey bone fine as hell, but he definitely tripping on the price. - Yeah, he needs to hurry up with his fine ass. - Yeah, he is fine though. - [Phone Salesman] Okay, so I got one with a better deal for you. - [Christina] Okay. Ew! Is that a flip phone? - Shh. - [Phone Salesman] Yes. - We'll take it. For half, right? - [Phone Salesman] Yeah, $179 out the door. - Are you serious? - [Phone Salesman] Yeah, you got taxes, you got activation, you can't just go walk into any store and get this phone for a steal like this. - [Lori] Okay, fine. - How you wanna pay for it? - Um, cash. - [Phone Salesman] Cash is always good. - I only have fifty on my card. Do you have any cash on you? - Oh yeah, right. - T, how the hell do you have all this money? - What, I told you I wasn't coming back. Just to know, we under these circumstances. - [Lori] Here you go - [Phone Salesman] All right, give me just a second. - [Lori] Thank you. T! - I know, sorry! - [Phone Salesman] Al right, here you go. Phone with a charger. - Thank you so much. - [Phone Salesman] You're welcome. Now look, you can't be tracked with this phone, but you should stay on no more than 30 seconds, but I say 20 just to be sure. - [Lori] Okay, all right, bye. little rasta. - [Phone Salesman] Have a good one ladies. - [Christina] Lo, what are you doing? - I'm getting all the numbers I need off this phone 'cause I gotta get rid of it. - [Christina] Oh. - Lo? - Hmm? - [Christina] You ever thought about going across the border to Canada? I mean, we do have a whole another country, like 20 minutes away from this. - And we should've went there last night. Ain't no way in hell we getting across the border now. That's probably the very first place they go with stuff like this happens. - [Christina] Yeah, you're right. - It was nice knowing you, baby. I'm gonna miss you. (Lori shrieks) - [Christina] Girl, you are so dramatic. - Shut up. All right, I'm about to call Mike back. - [Christina] All right. (car engine rumbles) - [Michael] Hello? - Hey Mike. - [Michael] Lori, are you okay? Please tell me what I'm hearing ain't true. - It depends on what you hearing - [Michael] That Mr. Davis, Tina's dead, is dead, and that you and Tina killed him. - [Lori] Oh nah, that's not true. Look, Mike, I just wanted to call you back and let you know that I'm okay, and everything is good. We just trying to figure out everything right now. Can you please do me a favor? I really need you to call Tiff, and check on her, and let her know that I'm okay? And please tell her to go to my cousin Kim's house. So she won't be on my mom's face until all this blows over, Okay? - [Michael] Okay, I got you. And L, - Mmhm. - [Michael] You call me if you need anything, okay? - Okay, I will. Thank you, I gotta go. All right, I'm about to call Chris. - [Chris] Hello? Hey baby. - [Chris] Who this? - Um, Me, Lori. - [Chris] Lori, are you by yourself? - Um, yeah. - [Chris] The fuck is going on with you? - Uh, hold on, calm down. What do you mean what's going on with me? - [Chris] I was tripping last night but you didn't answer. And my mom was telling about some shit that happened on the news. Now, what did you do? - I didn't do anything, and I'm fine. Thanks for asking. - [Chris] Look, Lori, I went to check my stash, and some shit was missing. Did you take that out of here? - What shit? - [Chris] The shit you took. Whether that's a throwaway. Well if you do have it, you need to get rid of it. - Hold on, hold on. A throwaway, what the hell is that? - [Chris] Oh my god. And you have the nerve be to taking shit? That's not registered, that's not a registered piece, Lori. It's called a throwaway 'cause it's dirty. It has bodies on it. - What the fuck, Chris? Why do you even have that? - [Chris] Lori, I love you, but I can't be caught up in no shit with that, so you need to get rid of it, and hit me when everything is okay, baby. I'll see you soon. - [Christina] What? What he say? - That he loves me and to hit me up when everything is good 'cause he can't get caught up in this shit. - [Christina] (Lori sighs) Oh wow. Sorry, L. - Yeah, me too. - [Christina] Look, I don't know where our next destination is, but, um, can it be towards the food because I'm hungry and dehydrated. - [Lori] Yeah, just let me keep driving for a few more miles, I gotta get some gas. - All right, cool. Where are we? - I don't even know. I'm just trying to get as far away from the city as I can. Um, you think I could get some more cash? I've only got a few bucks with me, and I don't wanna use my card. - Oh yeah. Um, how much you need? - Just whatever to fill up the tank. - All right. - And T, where did you get all that money from, anyway? - It's not even a lot of money. It's only $600. It was from searing stuff. - Was? You keep saying that like we not going. - [Christina] Are we? (hip-hop plays) The fact that I have to settle for snacks right now is, it's a bit much. - [Lori] You gotta get what you can get and shut up. - [Christina] Oh, woo! Jackpot, damn! (plastic crinkling) (door bell rings) - [Christina] Good. Oh my gosh! Can I see those glasses right there, please? - [Lori] Can I get 30 on pump eight? - Yeah, sure. - [Lori] Thank you. - [Christina] Thank you. Let's see. Lo, how do I look? - [Lori] Stupid. - Perfect. I'll actually take another one please. - [Lori] I'm not putting those on. - Stop acting like that, we can be twins. And don't worry about putting it in the bag. Okay, we're gonna wear them right out. - [Lori] Girl, I am not wearing that shit. - [Christina] Yes you are. Thank you. So, um? - [Lori] So? - What we eating, Lo? I am hungry. - [Lori] You always hungry. - Okay, first of all, you right. Second of all, I know. - Why are you so happy, bro? - I just feel free. You know, road trip my best friend! You know what I'm saying, bonding time! - Girl, we are on the run for murder. This ain't no damn road trip. You tripping, my baby. - Yeah. We got some more weed? - Hell yeah, you know we got some more weed! - [Christina] All right, yeah. - Come on 'cause I'm getting an attitude if I don't smoke. Anyway, let's go. - [Christina] See that's why you need to eat. That's gonna make you feel better, my baby. - We know that we have two young ladies, there's, uh, Lori Holmes and Christina Davis. Christina Davis is the daughter of the deceased Eric Davis, and we know that both of them attended the party last night. However, neither one of them are professing to the murder, yet. - Mm. - Now while I believe they did commit the murder, I don't believe that it was premeditated. We also know that they stayed at the Red Room last night on 696, but I'm sure they're checked out by now. And they shouldn't be too far. And these young ladies, they have no plan, and no money. So we should be able to bring them in easy. - Uh, from my understanding they didn't have any close friends other than the two of them, but I still want to talk to a few of their classmates that went to the party. I mean, somebody had to hear something. - Indeed. Well, let's get on then. (car beeps) - What, little weirdo? - I think I know where we're going. - Really? Where? - [Lori] Florida. - [Christina] Ooh, Miami? - No, but we're gonna be close though. - Ooh, we about to see some Miamians. - Dawg, what? (siren blares in distance) But no, It's my auntie house on my dad's side. - On your dad's side? - Mmhm. - I didn't even know you knew them like that. And he got a sister? - Well, it's his stepsister. Um, my grandma and her daddy they got together, and, um, they got a divorce like eight years ago. But my dad her were older by that time so they stayed in touch. I only met her a few times though when she came to the city. Last time at my grandma's funeral, and the very last time was at my dad's funeral, five years ago, so. But the only reason I contacted her is because I knew she was into fraud or whatever, and I know she can get us some documents. - Documents? - Yeah, like IDs, passports, birth certificates, the whole nine. - What do we need all that for? You trying to change your identity? - You not? - I mean, damn. I don't know, L. Is this what it's really come to? (Lori sighs) - What you wanna do, T? Just drive around until your little $600 gone? - No, but I mean, okay, what if we get new identities? Then what? - We live, T. We live! 'Cause Tina and Lori's asses might be going to jail. - So we headed to Florida? (Christina laughs) Look, the only thing is, it's 17 hours away. I had calculated it in a guy's GPS 'Cause I need to Write the directions down. So I mean, we might as well knock some of this time out, and I guess if we get tired we could stop and get a room. - All right, let's get it.

Besides, I am tired, buzzed, and horny. - Okay. - So please, just come on. - And I'm gonna be outside the room, sleeping in my car. - The car? - I'm not gonna watch y'all bang all night. - The car? - Yes! - Now come on 'cause I'm sleepy. - Whatever Lo, I don't have time to be going back and forth with you.

(car door opens) - [Michael] Oh shoot. - I can't believe you actually came. - You thought I wouldn't? I believe this is for you. - [Lori] Thank you. Mike, how the hell did you get here? - Girl, now you know, it only take an hour and a half to fly out here from Detroit. Now, how else was I gonna get you that money? There's about two g's in there. - 2 g's? Mike, I told you $500, a $1000 if you could. - And I could. - I just wanted to make sure y'all was straight. Y'all straight right? - I don't know. Just a few weeks ago, I was planning my new life at EDU as a new woman, and now I'm out here on the run as a new woman. - Yeah. - I'm just scared, like, what if this doesn't work out for us? - It is gonna work. And it look like you've got everything under control as far as I can see. So definitely don't give up. - Can you do me a favor? - Yeah, what is it? Can you give this bracelet to Tiff? She loves this thing and she always tries to wear it, so I want her to have this. - Yeah, I got you. Well, Lori. - I still can't believe you came. (Lori giggles) - Does it matter if we drive to town? - Why? - I don't know, I mean, it's a beautiful night out here. You can just sit here and look at the stars. - Oh my god. (car engine revs) (car beeps) - This is fancy. - [Michael] I know. (car beeps) - Hey. - What's up? - Remember, I told you that thing we need to get back to. - Yeah So you finally gonna tell me about it? - No, I'ma show you.

Well, it was the same for me. Just know that, It's just sophomore year, when my mom's boyfriend they kinda tried to rape me, and I didn't know what to do after that. - Damn, L, I, I didn't know that. - Yeah, I knew you didn't. But before you could do anything, I stabbed him with the pen. After that, it just made me hard to be touched by you. And I love being around you, and being with you, it's just every time you tried to touch me, I just thought of him, so. - Damn. L, I'm sorry, but why didn't you tell me this? - (inaudible) so I'm sorry, you know? Do you want to know what happened? - No. - Why? 'Cause if you tell me, then I'll be lying to people if I say, I don't know what happened. - I'ma miss you. - I'ma miss you more. (somber hip-hop ends) - [Christina] I'll be right back, Lo. Let's go in here real quick. (car door slams shut) Lo! Lo, start the car! - [Lori] What the fuck? What the fuck? - [Christina] Start the car, hurry up! - [Lori] Oh my gosh! (Christina cheers) (car engine roars) - (Christina laughs) What did you do, T? What did you do? - I got us some cash. What? What's wrong with you? - What's wrong with me? T, what has gotten into you? - We needed the money. - So you rob a gas station for it? - Look, it doesn't matter, Lori. The way I see it is, whatever I do now as Christina Davis, don't really matter. We about to go off and live a whole new life in another country. So for now this is what I have to do. So just calm down and we will be back to normal once I get up out of here, okay? - We have to make it there first, T. - We will! We will! But for now We gotta get up out of here. Come on, let's go! - We got a hit on the girls. - [Detective Byrons] What? - Yup, little Ms. Christina Davis robbed a gas station in Valdosta, Georgia at 8:36 this morning. - What? That was like five hours ago. Why would they rob a gas station? - Why? Because they're young, and dumb, and on the run for murder. They're probably broke by now. - No. Thomas, these aren't just some dumb young girls. I thought you understand that for the last six years neither one of them ever had less than a 3.9 GPA. And this July, they're gonna be entering Eastern Detroit University. And Lori Holmes, Lori Holmes has a creative writing scholarship. So no, these aren't just some young girls that are looking to be on the run for murder. They actually have futures ahead of them. I just simply think they got caught up- - Well caught up or not, we kinda know which direction they were headed in. The gas station attendant said they were in a drop top. He didn't get the make or model. I'm gonna go check on some leads, but Byrons, I know you have a soft spot for these girls, but they're not her. They're not your little sister. I'ma see if they have any contacts in Georgia. You need to get your head back in the game before the captain cuts it off. - [Detective Byrons] Jesus. What have y'all done? (dramatic hip-hop begins) (dramatic hip-hop ends) - I think this the right room. - Let's knock. (Lori knocking on door) - [Michelle] Lori baby, is that you? - [Lori] Yeah, it's me, auntie. - Hey, look at you, you look so pretty! - [Lori] Hi! - How you doing? - Oh, um, and this is my best friend, Tina. - Hey, you here too girl, looking like a model. Y'all come on in here. - [Lori] Thank you so much for letting us come down here, auntie. - Well of course, Lori. You're my niece, you know I got you, girl. - [Lori] Thank you. - That's why I had both of you come meet me here at the hotel instead of the house, just in case the cops looked me up, you know? Are y'all hungry? - [Christina And Lori] Yes! - [Michelle] Okay, so I'll go on ahead and get the food ready. Why don't you ladies freshen up. In the bathroom over there, we have some towels and some washcloths. And you can put your bags there. - Okay. - [Michelle ] Hey, Lorissa, I'm gonna talk to you in a minute, baby. - Okay. - [Michelle ] Tina you can go ahead and stuff. Go freshen up. - Okay, um you said it was through this door? - [Michelle ] Mmhm, right there. - [Christina] Thank you. - [Michelle ] You're welcome. - Here, use honey instead of sugar. - [Lori] Thank you. - So how have you been before this little road trip. - Um, I've been okay. - Just okay? - Mmhm. - How's Tiff and your mom been doing? - Well, Tiff is good, she's getting on my nerves, of course. And my mom, well, she's my mom. - That she is. I know we touched base just a little bit over the phone, but I need you to tell me exactly what happened. (dramatic piano music plays) (shower running) - I shot Tina's dad and I killed him. - Okay, where were you at? - At a house party, one of the girls at school. - Okay, and this happened Friday? - [Lori] Mmhm. - Okay, look, I reached out to my lawyer friend, and- - Lawyer friend? Lawyer friend for what? - Lori. - No auntie! I asked you to reach out to one of your friends to hook us up with passports, identities, and shit. The fuck is this? - Lori, calm down and sit down. Now, I've actually done both. I contacted my girl for your identities, and it's all good. However, I reached out to my friend, Sammy, who is an attorney, so I could see what your options could be. Listen, baby, by what you're telling me, we can get this on a manslaughter. - Manslaughter? (Lori sighs) That sounds so crazy. - I know. Would it be okay? It just mean that you did it, but you really didn't mean to. - So how much time is that? - Well, in Michigan, a manslaughter charge can serve up to 15 years. - 15 years, auntie? - Yes, Lori, meaning up to 15 years, but it could be five, or it could be nothing. Sammy already heard a case, and he wants to take you girls on. He really think he can get you off on a case for self-defense. We're just gonna have to tweak it a little, no biggie. - I don't know. - Lori, look at me. I can go tomorrow and pick up your passports and IDs, and you can be on your way to Jamaica by Wednesday, but then what? Hmm? You gonna live your life always scared and worried? I really think you should consider tying yourself in babe. But what about Tina? - She'll be okay. Now what? - She kinda robbed a gas station because we needed the money. - Y'all are killing me. Did you rob it with her? - I stayed in the car. I didn't even know she was gonna do it. - Good, that's your story, and that's what we gonna stick to. Tina will be fine. - Do you still have the number to the detective you talked to? - Yes. - Okay, I'ma call Sammy and see how we should go about returning you, and that's that. - I need to go talk to Tina. Okay, well look, just go ahead and freshen up first, and then we can sit down and eat dinner and discuss it, okay? - [Lori] All right. - [Detective Byrons] Mmhm, yeah. (door creaks) (Detective Thomas knocking on door) All right, get that to me at 7:00. What you got Thomas? - So, uh, we got a couple of hits on Tina, but it's really iffy though. Some distant relatives she's never met before, but you never know. - Yeah, I heard they're in Florida as well. - [Detective Thomas] Florida, I knew it. see, everybody loves Miami. - Nope. Uh, Orlando. So you said, Lori Holmes has a aunt, cousin, or something on her father's side. Mrs. Michelle Carter, she's an entrepreneur, and the wife of Louis Fernandez. - Then that's gotta be it, right? I mean, 'cause I feel like they were leaving Georgia, not entering. - [Detective Byrons] You know what, and if they drove straight through by Valdosta, they should be there by now. I'll grab the car. - Auntie, this grilled chicken salad was the bomb. Like, that was really good. - Well, thank you. It's my favorite to make, real easy. - Yeah, it was so good, thank you so much. - Okay, look at y'all. (everyone laughs) - Um, so T. - [Christina] Mmhm. - We need to talk about everything - Okay, bet! Shoot, when did we get our new IDs? Because I just need to know like, do we get to pick our own name or did they already come made, like, how does this stuff work? - So, about everything, check it out, auntie contacted one of her friends who is a lawyer, and he said, we'll be better off if we turn ourselves in, and we can go for this thing called manslaughter with, with a charge up to 15 years, but that's only up to, and he says, we don't even have to do that. 'Cause he gonna try to get everything dropped. So we gonna be good. - What happened to the original plan? - I'ma go ahead and clear this table. Excuse me. (dishes clanging) - So, what happened? - Nothing really happened, it's just, after talking to auntie it just makes more sense. - How does going to jail for 15 years, over beautiful ass Jamaica, make sense? Make it make sense, Lori! - It's up to 15, T! And Sammy says, we have a very strong case, so we not even gonna have to take that. Look, even if we do a little time, we'll still be young as hell when we get out. We can have kids and a family. The only thing we know about Jamaica is pretty shit we see on TV. White sands, sexy chocolate men, and bomb parties. But what about real life? Huh, T? What about real life? What we just gonna party every day? This ain't no goddamn movie. (dramatic music plays) - Let me guess, you got that from auntie. Man, you don't even know, girly! I'm your best friend! - [Lori] Act like it! - You don't even know if this can work, Lori! We haven't even tried. Look Lo, I don't want us to turn ourselves in, okay? I have been locked up my whole life like a prisoner. All I'm saying is, just please think about it a little more. Don't make me do this alone 'cause I'm not changing my mind. (door opens) (door shuts) - You okay? - [Lori] Not really. I'm just trying to figure out what I got to do with my life. - You girls been through it these past couple days. You just need someone. Well, figure it all out in the morning, okay? Okay, now one more thing. Where's the gun? (dramatic music ends) - [TV Voice] Remain calm and assist family members or neighbors who may be vulnerable if exposed to- - Hey auntie, I see you! (Michelle and Lori laugh) - [Michelle] Okay, so, I have a few things to go handle, so you girls make yourself comfortable, okay? - Okay. - I would say, to enjoy the word, but I got (inaudible) instead. I'll be back in a few, okay? - [Lori] All right. - [Michelle] All right. - [TV Voice] Keep your refrigerator and freezer doors closed as much as possible to keep cold in, and heat out. Do not use the stove to heat your home. - I'm getting tired already, but it's still kinda early. - Yeah, think I'ma get Tiff to call me on the phone. - Yeah, she's probably worried. So, um, you think your auntie's gonna get our stuff? (Lori sighs) - T, I don't know if I can do it. - All right. - All right? - Yeah Lori, I know you got Tiff and all that, so let me just do this myself. - By yourself? You're not listening. I don't think auntie is gonna get anything if we're not going together, and I really think we could beat this, T. - [TV Voice] Cease activity and call 911 for immediate response. - Wow. Wow. She's literally only known me for 10 seconds and she thinks she knows what's best for me. T, we could beat this, and Jamaica will still be here. Why don't you get it? - [TV Voice] Avoid crowded public areas and gatherings. Do not travel into areas affected by the attack. - Yeah, but what if we don't What if we don't, Lori? Look, I have been locked up my whole life. Like a prisoner, living with that man! I hated him so much. I didn't understand how he could treat us like that and why my mom wouldn't just leave. I waited 18 years to finally be free. - [TV Voice] Avoid acting on unconfirmed information and rumors. If you come in contact with the infected, seek medical attention immediately. Report suspicious activity and then call 911 for immediate response. - I'm sorry. - What are you sorry for? Huh? For killing my father? Because I'm not. Look, I didn't think I would be around to see him die, but I was. (Christina slow claps) Thank you. - T, stop! - Look, whatever. I need to get some air. - [Lori] Where are you going? - [Christina] For a walk. Is that okay with you? - [Lori] I don't think you need to be doing that right now. - [Christina] Whatever. Like I said, I'm going for a walk. I'll be back. I'm just going to the pier. - [TV Voice] Assist neighbors when they need help. Avoid acting on unconfirmed information and rumors. If you come in contact with the infected, seek medical attention immediately. - Hey - [Tiff] Hey. - Are y'all okay? - Yeah, we good. Are you okay? - [Tiff] Yeah, I'm good. What's wrong, Lo? - Nothing. Me and T just kinda got into it, um, but that's not what I called you for. Listen, I might be gone for awhile, so this what I need you to do. (waves crashing) (wind blowing) - I wish I could fly. (Christina sighs) (car engine rumbles) - Uh, This should be it right up here. - [Detective Byrons] Which one? - Right over here. - [Detective Byrons] Oh, okay. (phone rings) So many places, these girls better be in here. What, whose this? Captain. Hey, cap. Yeah, we just getting here. Mmhm. What? Where? Captain, you can't let them get to the girls before we do. They're gonna approach them as if they're armed and dangerous, and they're not! Okay. Okay, yeah, I don't, I don't think we're too far from there. All right. Bye. It's the captain. They got a trace on the girls, they not even here. - What, where are they? - [Detective Byrons] I have no- (phone rings) - Who is it? - [Detective Byrons] It's private. - Answer it, pick up. - [Detective Byrons] Hello? Yeah, Byrons here. Hi, Lori, How are you? Okay, but where? No Lori, we know you're not in Tampa. We got a trace on the call that you stayed on a little too long. They're coming tonight. There is no tomorrow, Lori. So tell me exactly where you are so we can come and get you, and then you can turn yourselves in safely. Okay, okay. 369 London Way. 369 London Way, got it. Yeah. Now, stay put, do not answer the door for anyone, Right, you'll know it's me when I arrive. Okay, we're on our way. What's the fuck is going on with these girls, I swear. - [Detective Thomas] I know, I just hope we get there before the team does. - Exactly. (car engine rumbles) - [Lori] T. - Shit! L, you scared the hell out of me. - Yeah okay, we gotta go, come on. - Ooh, where we going? Jamaica? - No, for real, T, we gotta get out of here. I just talked to the detective. He says that they know where at aunt Michelle's hotel. - Hold up. You was talking to the detective? - Yes, now come on. Look, he wants us to meet him at the hotel, so we'll be safe when we turn ourselves in. Now look, auntie's taken care of everything with the lawyer, so you ain't got nothing to worry about. Now, let's go. - So as soon as I leave the house, you on the phone talking to the- - Are fucking serious right now? - Yeah I am! Now you want me to meet up with them? I told you I needed a minute to get my thoughts together, but as soon as I leave the house, you on the phone turning us in! - Don't even play me like that, you know that's not true. - It is! - It's not! - Look, whatever Lori. Since you're seem to not be hearing me, listen up 'cause I'ma only say this once, Fuck you! Fuck them weak ass police! Fuck everything else 'cause I'm not going to fucking prison! Did it sink in that time? - [Lori] Fucking stupid. So what are you gonna do, T? They're on our ass! (Detective Thomas knocking on door) - [Michelle] Yes? - Where are they? Are they still here? - [Michelle] Excuse me? - Look, Ms. Carter, I don't have time for this. - What are you talking about? - I've already spoken to Lori, now where are they? - All I wanted to do was go to Jamaica. - T! T! - But I can't even do that. (dramatic music plays) - Wait, I think I see Lori. - [Detective Byrons] Where? So where's Tina? Oh no, no, she's not gonna surrender. - [Lori] T, no! - [Detective Byrons] Lori, no! (rifle fires) - So what you think? - That's it? (Michael chuckles) - [Lori] Yeah, what you mean? - So Tina just died, and what happens to Lori? - Yeah, is she okay? Does she go to jail or anything? - Right? - Guess you gotta find out when my book comes out. - Really? - Yeah, that's messed up, Lo. You can at least give us the exclusive. Come on now. - Uh no. - You know what, whatever man. Look, is y'all ready to go, man? - Yeah. - I'm done paying for you too since you- - Boo hoo hoo. You're such a baby! - Whatever, man.
