To you, I may not be your first... You have power and you are in a high position enough to... Did I look like I was that kind of person to you? No, that's not what I meant... It's because of my situation... My situation... I was also sincere. Today was really fun. I had fun too thanks to you. I had some complicated issues... Good night. Excuse me! This... What is this? I bought it at the stadium. You're a Pisces. I saw you fill out the form for the raffle. I'm also a Pisces. I see... I hope those complicated issues get resolved and go as you wish. Thank you. Are you going back to the company? I'm waiting for some faxes because today's the last day for diploma verification. We could go back together, but why are you getting off here? People have eyes. If someone were to see us going back into the hotel together... I don't want to be seen as the kind of woman who is trying to gain favor with a Director for a promotion. Then... Your sushi is here. Thank you. People have eyes. If someone were to see us going in the hotel together... Your inquiry of Miss Jang Mi Ri's graduation has not been verified. -Tokyo University. Your inquiry of Miss Jang Mi Ri's graduation has not been verified. -Tokyo University. What are you doing here? You're here! I thought you'd be hungry. I was cleaning your desk a bit because you're not here. You bought something? I thought you'd be hungry, so I bought takeout and stopped by at your office. We're on the same page. Let's eat. Yes. What are you doing with the newspaper? Huh? Oh, I want to cover the table I'll do it. No. I'll do it. You should sit down. Here you go. I don't think I can do this. I'll leave first. I stayed too long. What if someone comes in.. I'm OK, but if your reputation gets tarnished... No, I don't even want to imagine that. I'll leave first. Miss Jang Mi Ri, I'm sorry to burden you. I'll go. Your inquiry of Miss Jang Mi Ri's graduation has been verified. -Tokyo University. The entire employees at Hotel A, in response to the recent disgraceful incident, started a special investigation team and re-verified all executives' and staff's educational background in order to remove our guests' doubt and regain their trust. As a result, we confirmed that there are no illegalities in executives' and staff's educational background. What's the purpose of re-verification? Is it bcause of the negotiation with Mondo Group? That's not the sole reason. What's the timeline for the merger? We're fine-tuning it now. We'll announce it when it is finished. I just got the message that Mondo is going to have a press conference to announce their withdrawal from the acquisition. What's going on? We did our best to revive the tradition of services by taking over Hotel A that has the personalized services system. However, it did not work out and we came to a decision to withdraw our investments all together. What is the background of the decision? I'd have to say problems with Hotel A's management that were revealed by the recent controversy. There is no room for reconsideration? It's impossible to reverse the decision since it was made by the emergency board meeting. Are you just going to watch and do nothing? Yes, we agreed that it's hard to restore the ruined image. But your mom doing this when the situations are completely different... Let's find a way to take care of this without having to get the board of director's approval. What's the reason for this sudden decision? We'd rather a hotel with no crisis than a hotel with great crisis management capabilities. I'd like to know the reason why you're doing this without giving us an advance notice. We were in urgent situations. Mondo Group's size of assets are too big to run into a crisis because you withdrew from an acquisition. Of course, it's true we had a problem caused by forgery of academic records. We got a notice you'd withdraw if the problem doesn't get resolve. But the issue was already taken care of. So why are you doing this in spite of that? This acquisition was not very attractive to us. It was all because of what Director Song wanted. And the Board of Directors couldn't wait for him any longer. Director Song is here. Come in. I was about to call you. Sit down. Director Jang is here. I think he wants to discuss withdrawal of the acquisi... I haven't given up on the acquisition yet. We waited past the reasonable, practical time limit for something that we should have given up earlier. But now that the Board's decided on and officialized the withdrawl, we can't continue... Acquiring Hotel A as a subsidiary company based on a new investment... is still possible. For that, not only do we need a new investor, but also the approval from the President... I will discuss the matter with Father. The new investment will be sufficient with 2% of my shares in Mondo. [It's possible] As long as Mother approves it and Director Jang will decide to stay. Is it possible for both of you? I'll give you time till midnight. But it would be better if you could decide earlier. Then the new beginning... I'll decide right now. If we decide too late, Hotel A's stocks may turn into mere papers. Then... do it. Thank you for approving. We'll contact you for details. We'll schedule a reception to announce the timeline for the acquisition. I'll call you again. Then, I'll take my leave. I'm here mum. Yukata. Yeo Hyeon Ah. Yukata, wake up. Yu chan. Yu chan, wake up. I love you, our Yukata. Mum... Get up, Yukata. Alright, good job, Yu chan. That was good. You did a good job, Yu Chan. Have I done well? I want to hear you compliment me like that time. Please tell me I did a good job like last time and compliment me on my hard work. Where are you? You did it after all. I'm sure you wanted to do it. And you should do it. I would have done the same if I were you. Aren't you angry? I've always been sorry, because only I survived the accident. You couldn't even spend a lot of time with your mother. Why are you saying this to me? That's not all. I even brought in a new mother when you were so little. I'm thankful that you grew up without rebelling. Even if I had 10 mouths, I have nothing to say. Father. Does she resemble your mother? That girl that you are interested in. Yes. I knew it. And? What's going to happen to our company? - Mondo Group will take over our company, no? - There goes Director Jang. Wow, he is so cool... Can we sit? Enjoy your meal. What's going on with the promotional video? What do you mean? They say Mondo asked us to create a PV to distribute. If you think about it, it's not an everyday task. You know, VP of Mondo Group started off that way. She was working at the hotel and was chosen to be a model for a PR brochure. Ahhh! You're not eating? I don't really have an appetite. I'm always waiting for your call... I don't know why I'm like this. I'm sorry. I had too much backlogged work to sign off on. But while I was working Jang Miri never left my mind. What should I do, really? I just settled in finally, and I keep wondering where you are, who you're meeting with. If he really becomes president, he may not want to see me any more... I'm really worried... nervous... Why do you think such thoughts? That won't ever happen. I don't know if I'm doing okay. I came all the way here to do well and I didn't even know we were filming a promotional video I'm so ashamed of myself. It might be a good chance for me... I didn't sleep at all. I have a person I love but I can't tell anyone about it. I didn't know it would be this difficult. I think I might make mistakes being like this... I want to become an employee who is indispensable to our hotel. You already are. To the hotel and to me too. I don't think I am yet. I'm really upset... And I'm having a hard time. I want to be with you. Timing and subtitles brought to you by MissRipley team @ viki . Com. Since you said this would be distributed worldwide, so I looked through the famous actress. But what do you think of using a new face instead? Here are some pictures. This is a case of using one's own employees as a model. I agree with you. Yes, selecting someone from staff... Wouldn't it be a minus in terms of promoting our hotel? Instead, using a Hallyu star may make a stronger (more stable) impact. Hallyu stars have been exposed so much lately, Time is an issue, too. The schedule for shooting is too tight even if we start this week. Even if we audition someone, camera testing and memorizing scripts... If it's OK with you, I look through the hotel data yesterday, I saw the woman employee who was in the newspaper. She looks fine. What do you think? But Jang Mi Ri is... It can be fresh. What do you think? She has more potential than she lets on. She may be the best cast if we want to portray passion, fresh start and. Hotel A starting anew. Are you ready? Yes. One. Cue! I'll help you check in. Customer, it's all ready. Cozy space, comfortable interior design, come and experience luxury at Hotel A. Our banquet hall that's adorned with 20,000 crystals can be used for various conferences, weddings or your company's promotional activities. It can be devided into two sections, and gorgeous interior design, uhm... Let me do that again. I'm sorry. Start over. Cue! Our banquet hall, adorned with 20,000 crystals... So as long as we decide upon the concept, we'll be able to increase the earning rate from 20 to 50? Of course, their overall resources are great. Especially, the system that's trained to tailor to each and every single guest was impressive. Now it seems that what's left is a good plan. Do you think we should wait a little longer? Wouldn't we find out at the baseball game? I don't want to rush it. Her heart has to move. Hee Joo's heart. Well... I think she recieved a notice that she won the contest. Excuse me, what is this... We just received it, too. It's related to aiding in forgery of private documents, and it's an open case. So selecting a such person for the winner of our contest... Your design was great. We looked into it because you seemed capable... I know what you're saying but.. This isn't true. The perpetrator hasn't been caught yet but it isn't me. I don't know how he stole it and used it but I... I know. It looks like you are professor Moon Ji Hoon's daughter on your resume.. The person who did it is none other than Dr. Moon's daughter... we can't believe it either. Drink slowly. What if you pass out drinking like that? That's why I'm drinking. Thank you for coming. What kind of 'hi' is that to a friend? OH. Friend.. Right we said we'll be friends. Ahjumoni, could you give me another shot glass please? Why am I such an idiot? You feel like an idiot? No. Not feel. I am one. A real idiot. I care too much about other people getting hurt or getting in trouble when I can't even take care of myself I can't even take care of my documents... I tarnish my dad's reputation.. My father isn't someone who can be casually accused by others. Of course, he's not. Do you know my dad? Yes. How? Hotel A our company is taking over was Dr. Moon's only failure. A failure? Is it not to your taste? You worked hard for fliming. No. It's delicious. Then try this. It's soft. It seems like the food is not to your taste. It's been several days since I lost my appetite. I'm sorry. Then do you want to go somewhere and have a glass of wine? I don't think I'll be comfortable wherever we go. Do you think those cars.. Know where they are going? Do you think they'll know how hard the road is going to be? What do you mean? If only I had known how hard loving someone was... It's because you are tired. I think it's best that you go home early and rest. It was difficult for us to meet, We're anxious whether people will see us together. Then we go back to our own places. After going back home, we think about each other... You think about me when you're home? Always. I can only imagine. How big is his room would be? How would it look like? What would he be doing right now? Would he be lonely? Rather than doing this... I should have gone with him... Do you... Want to go together? Will that be okay with you? Probably that's when... Dr. Moon lost you. Usually when he designs something, he joins in from the planning stage. But because of that incident, he could only participate in designing at that time. Come to think of it, I think I read that he found some flaws in the design, but he couldn't do anything about it because of the opening date. I have his design diary. That's right. I think that's what was written in the field record Dr. Moon has left. You know a lot about my father. I had a lot of interest. To tell you the truth, that's why I told him that I would convince you. Chul Jin was having difficulty in bringing you into the team. Of course, working in the planning team with many people would be less fun and more work than designing, and you might not want to go back because you quit like that. But this is a good opportunity for you to improve something your father found lacking. And I think this is a good opportunity for you to _________. Can you reconsider? Come in... This is my... If I knew this was gonna happen, I would have left the windows open or something.. Since I live alone... I feel like I can live now.. Your place is nice and has a great view. I spend a lot of time by myself so it would be suffocating if it didn't. Yes, that's true. Your father looks like a nice person. He can live without any law. He thought running a dry cleaner was his calling. So my mother was really frustrated, that he didn't know how to inspire his only son's dreams. What was your dream? I didn't have one. Huh? Do you think that's strange? It's not that it's strange, but a bit unexpected. I didn't think you would be like that. We were really poor. So I was afraid to dream. The more I dream, the more poverty I saw in my father's life. So I figured that I shouldn't dream. That's why I couldn't accept your fountain pen easily. When I became a doctor, my mother gave me a fountain pen for the first time. Funny, isn't it? No, I don't think it's funny. I think we are very similar yet very different. I...always had too many dreams. Sometimes it would be the President, other times it would be a singer, or it would be Miss Korea. Pretty funny, right? You're not going to ask why? I think I know. Yes. Because I was so poor. Because I was poor and lonely, I wanted to change. If I could I would do everything and be different, no, very different. Like a completely different person. Not being embarrased of my job, and not being embarrased of where I live. I wanted to live like that. Funny right? No. This is the first time I've told anyone this. I like being together like this; being able to talk. What time did you come back yesterday? About 1am? What did you do until that late, and with who? Don't worry about it. It's all because of work. But are you just going to keep playing around? I don't know. Well, there aren't too many things you can do. Actually, I wanted to talk to you about something. Should I get a job on some planning team? Planning Team? I don't know where it is, but would they accept you? Even if they did, could you do such complicated work? So, It's not like any other place. It's Mondo Group. What? Mondo? Monkey see, Monkey do. What? Do you know what kind of company Mondo is? All I know is they own 7-star resorts all over the world. Chul Jin Oppa, no..Yoohyun-Shi said... What can entry-level workers like them possibly know? You hang out with boys like them, and the way you think has just... Why would you say something like that? Because you're not making sense. What on earth doesn't make sense? You probally think it's easy since kids like them are working there, but Mondo's fully booked for the next 3 years by important public figures from all over the world. They are a global company, literally, and a company like that would want you in their planning team? How can you do such a job? Who said I'll do it? I'm just thinking if I should do it or not, or if I can really do it. That's why I'm saying it doesn't make sense. The kids don't know anything and yet tell someone to do stuff as if they know everything, and the kid who gets swayed by them. Sure, let's stop. I'm just saying this because I'm worried about you, but since you don't want to listen, let's stop. And honestly, you do have problems. Can you even survive at a place like that? Let's stop. I don't want to talk about that. When your parents passed away you couldn't even talk. That's why you only studied. Isn't that what you told me when I saw you on campus last time? Do you really have to put it that way? I'm saying this for you! It's obvious you're going to get hurt. And you'd rant and whine to me while working there. Are you saying that you don't want me to go there because you're afraid to meet me at work? Who said that? Fine. Think whatever you want. Who's trying to stop you from going into the lion's den. Let's drop it. Mondo? She sure is funny. Are you going to work? Shouldn't you know something inside and out if you're gonna advise someone on it? Pardon? What is it? Something must have happened. This is a guest list for the reception. Do I have to go? Your "seclusion disease" is coming back? Well, I'm uncomfortable in the limelight. This party is like the first function after the acquisition. From officials of Ministry of Culture to important figures, everyone's curious about you. It doesn't make sense you want to run a business without introducing yourself to people like them. What time is it? 7 pm. Just think of it as introducing yourself to everyone you have to meet anyway, all at once. I get it. Really? Why? Can't you believe it that you got invited to such a place? No.. I don't know if this is real or a dream. You're going as our company's model to represent our company to an event that's meant to announce that our hotel will become one with Mondo. You have a lot to prepare. Yes. Mondo's receptions are known to invite V Vips only among important figures from various fields. For me to go to such a place; Moreover as a hotel representative. I can't believe it. It's because of your hard work. Getting invited to World Journalism Association's seminar and getting good results for the promo video. No, being able to go to a function with you makes me happier than those achievements. Me too. This will be a stepping stone for Jang Miri to advance to the next level to a wider world, and there will be many people to meet for you to do that. It's all thanks to you. Thank you so much. I will prepare well. Fighting! Yes! Why are you here? I told you to wait. Please support us by NOT creating hard-sub using this video subtitle. Ahigoo. I'm really... Is this her resume? It's a diploma. Diploma- Moon Hee Joo. What? Why is this here? Welcome, Director. Hello. I should be calling you President now. I guess so. Yes. What do you think? They were all brought in from Hong Kong. They would fit the size that you mentioned. Everything looks good. Is that you Mi Ri? Yeah. I totally look like this school's student, don't I? Yeah. Right? It suits me doesn't it? What about the perpetrators? There are so many forged documents it's impossible to identify the culprit. That's a relief. This is... I thought you might need it. You don't like it? No. It's really pretty. I didn't imagine this. I'm glad you like it. Of course. Truthfully, I was worried. I'm thankful that you even considered to take me with you. But I was afraid I might lower your class. Don't think like that from now on. I want to make Jang Mi Ri become more successful and happier through me. I thought about not going.. I hope your future dreams become reality. Thank you for so many things. Go in. Please don't use honorifics. It makes me uncomfortable. OK then... No... If it's uncomfortable, I will do then. Drive home safely. Good night. Bye. You're not sleeping? I had to prepare for the party. I was invited as a company representative to a reception tomorrow to celebrate the acquisition. But the President even gave me a dress. The better I look, the better our company looks, he says. Since I'm the face of our company, now being a model for promotion. I feel like everything is working out now. Why are you like that? Something happened? What? What is it? This is yours. Yeah. It came out of your bag. I want to hear what happened. No. That is... You went through my bag? Don't change the subject here Mi Ri because this isn't something you can resolve by doing that. How annoying... I even went to the police station because of this. On top of that, they withdrew my winning in the design competition. I even ended up disgracing my father. So? Are you saying I did it? Why did you? I said it wasn't me! Tell me the truth. You're bringing an innocent person into the mess. It doesn't matter which side. Think whatever you want. If you did do it I don't care. I just want to know the truth. That's right. I did it. Why? Because I had to. To survive. I needed it so I could survive. You have your own! You got your diploma, so why? My diploma? Yeah. This is you. You, who were born into a good family and could finish school just fine, would never know the feelings of a girl like me. Did you... Yeah. I didn't graduate from Tokyo University. I have never even been there. Now you know? You... It's your fault. Why did I have to live like this. If you hadn't drunken that spoiled milk and didn't get sick.. I wouldn't have turned out this way. Are you saying it's because of that? Yeah. You don't know how my life was. Do you know how I lived in that house you were supposed to go to? I had to wash 50 comforters a day. Can you even imagine that? What would it be like to be a 10 year old who had to wash 50 comforters a day, comforters bigger than her? She couldn't even hide chapped and rough hands her frozen hands... For 6 years... while you were taking my place and comfortably studying, I was doing laundry until my hands froze, and wiping the floor until my knees were scraped. Do you think that's all? To repay my alcoholic stepfather's debts... Mi Ri.. No. You don't know. A girl like you would never understand. Is that why you did this? Yeah. What does it matter? Just because I forged a diploma? Since I did it, all things changed for me. It wasn't much. Nobody suspects anything. Isn't it funny? I'm still the same.. but people see me so differently because of some diploma. So are you happy? Yeah. I'm so happy. I'm not the Jang Mi Ri from back then. Ok then, if this compensated your hardship because of me. Good night. Oh. Hello. Are you going somewhere? What is it that the box is this big? Excuse me. I'll carry these for you. Excuse me. Stop it now. Don't you have any pride as a man? Excuse me. Oh. Did you already wash up? It's a special night. Yes. It's the day your Son has finally taken a step towards the future. Are you upset? No, what are you saying? It's nothing like that. Thank you. I'm always... It's nothing like that. Get ready. Manager Han? Yes. Good evening. How have you been Chairman? I'm sorry for the late introduction. Nice to meet you. You came? I heard everything from Representative Jang. I heard that you held on for us till the end. It was nothing. Since Director Jang decided right away, my work was easy. Why don't you two talk? Yes. I'm sorry I couldn't take care of it faster. Not at all. Let's stop talking about the past. Today's the day that we are finally on the same boat. Excuse me. I'm a little late aren't I? No, it's okay. It just started. Why? Am I... awkward? No, no it's not like that. You look really beautiful today. It's all thanks to you. Let's go in. You have come. I am Jang Myung Hoon. I wasn't able to greet you last time you came. I apologize. I've heard a lot about you. I am Song Gi Chang. Hello. Hello. Please, be comfortable now that we are one family. But, who is this lady? Ah yes. She's my employee. Her name is Jang Mi Ri. She was amazing with the whole Parliment incident. Ah, really? It's an honor to meet you. My name is Jang Mi Ri. Hello. Cheers. Excuse me. Can you talk? Why, what's going on? I think I'm going to do it. What? I will take that planning job. How is it? Can you remember them all? Yes. I'm trying. Don't try to remember all of them. Just try to remember the things that make them stand out. The related party is first, the rest, well, we'll have a chance to meet them again. Yes. Are you tense? Ah... A little bit. Ah... I didn't introduce you to the most important person. He is the owner of our company (Hotel A). And the heir of Mondo Group. It's that man over there with the white tuxedo. Ah... yes. He recently came back after studying in Japan. He really hates the exposure of his personal life. He must be eccentric. No no. From what I encountered, it might be because he is humble. Rather than position and rank, he cares more for his personal time. He doesn't say much, but he's easy going and has a warm side. Yes. He is someone who we'll run into often, so study him well, and leave a good impression. Yes. Let's go. Ah, Mr. Jang! I want to introduce you to one of my friends. Ah, okay. -Just a minute.-Yes. Is he in bad terms with his parents? If that was so, they wouldn't already have given him 1/3 of their shares. I apologize. I made an important person wait. I am Song Yoohyun. Do I have to keep it up? Did something happen yesterday? You left work early. My friend was really sick so I had to go home to look after her. Did you look for me? Brothers... That's how I want it to be. Is that impossible? If you can allow that. Time sure is good. Thanks to I... think I can open a store here. I couldn't get in touch with you. My phone was off. Tell me honestly. Was it really hard for you? Yes. It was really hard for me too. Until I met you that is.
