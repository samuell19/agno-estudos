Ho, ho, ho, ho. How you doin' there? Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas to you. (elevator dings) (phones ringing) - [Receptionist] Oh Mr. Black? (phones ringing) (people chattering) - The Bulls tickets to your friends, the crystal tractors to your clients and the fruitcake to the people you can't stand but have to be nice to. - Yeah, that's great. Anything else? - You are late for your meeting. - Ooh, ooh. Thank you Annie. (Annie chuckles) - Folks, I'm going to cut to the chase here. (door opens) Profits are down and we have to take action. After much thought and consultation, we've decided to downsize Beane's Tractor Corporation by laying off personnel at the factory level. I'm not happy about this, but our consultants tell us we have no other choice. - All right, folks. You've been selected for a very rare opportunity to save Beane's by traveling to our factories, assessing their productivity and cutting personnel by 50%. You have your assignments in front of you. - Don't you think that's kind of a cruel thing to do? I mean, it being the holidays and everything? - Oh, we'll wait until after Christmas before the pink slips go out. - Well how are we going to find out the truth if everyone knows why we're there? I mean, won't they be on their best behavior? - Secrecy is vital to the process. You'll be visiting our plants under the guise of being prospective clients. We have a phone line set up in case anyone checks your story. You have five days and we'll all meet back here Christmas Eve for the annual Christmas party. Okay? Good luck everybody. (employees chattering) - Mr. Gosling? Excuse me, sir. Mr. Gosling. I can't do this. - Jake, we've known each other a long time. I think of you as a son, a son who will take over the company when I retire. - Oh, I appreciate that, sir. You know, I do. It's just that Athens, Nebraska is my hometown. - Well, it should be simple for you to assess the workforce there. You know the people. - Well, not anymore. I moved away when I was just a boy, but uh, but that's not the point, sir. - I understand. - I mean, perhaps I could trade towns with George or Katie. - Jake... Someday this company could be yours. Maybe you want it, maybe you don't. Part of a job like mine is having to make difficult decisions. You have to decide whether you're that man, Jake. It's up to you. (soft blues music) - [Jake] That face. - Don't tell me that's you. - Yeah. It's right out of Norman Rockwell, isn't it? - Ever wonder what you would have become if you'd stayed? (chuckles) (soft blues music) (wind blowing) (upbeat Christmas music) - The thief didn't take anything else like money or something that could be used as a weapon. - Yeah. - Just the angel. - Yeah. - You know, my diorama has been an Athens Christmas tradition since 1956. It's a valuable asset to the community and an important tourist draw. - [Tom] Yes ma'am. - Without the angel it's just not the same. Things aren't like they used to be. - That's for sure, Margie. - Well, I feel better just knowing you're here, Tom. More coffee? - No, thanks. I better get right on it. You know, the more time that elapses between the crime and the search, the farther away the criminal or criminals can get. - You mean this could be a ring? (door chimes) - Hi Margie. - [Margie] Hi Emma. The usual? - Yes, please. - Coming right up. - Good morning, honey. - Um, I'm on call, Em. - Oh, I'm sorry. - We had a burglary. - We did? - My angel. (Emma gasps) - Who would do such a terrible thing? - I don't know, times are changing. - [Tom] Lock your doors, Margie. - Will do, Tom. - Bye honey. - Bye. - Got yourself a good man there, Emma. When you two gettin' married? - Oh, we'll get around to it someday. - Mm. - I'll see ya. - [Margie] God willin'. (soft music) - [Noelle] I have to do some shopping after rehearsal today, okay? - [Emma] Noelle, I don't want you wasting your money on me. - It's my money and I could do what I want with it. I'm practically an adult, mom. (soft music) You are going to pick me up, aren't you? - Oh, I'll be there early. I heard there's a blizzard coming. Have a good day at school. (kisses) - Aww mom.

(yells) - [Joe] Big storm comin'. - [Cal] Radio says 10 to 12 inches. - [Emma] Joe, dad, is that true? - [Cal] There's no way Beane's is gonna downsize us. - How could they ever think of such a thing? - Beane's headquarters has always known what a valuable plant this is. Seems they've forgotten. So we're going to have to remind them. We'll bring up our quotas, work our butts off and show them we're the best darn plant they got. - [Employees] Yeah! - Y'all up for a fight? - [Employees] Yeah! - Well I guarantee you things'll work out. They always have, and they always will. So go home and come back tomorrow ready to work and let's show 'em! - All right! - Yeah! - Yeah. - You got it right! - See you tomorrow. - Way to go. (employees chattering) - Hey, mister? Mister? Hey? Mister? Fixed your car. (Jake groans) - Hey, you had parts for a BMW here. - Yeah, used your coat hanger.

I have to watch her every minute. She needs something nice to happen to her. - You're a good kid, Noelle. I wish I had a kid like you. (soft music) - [Emma] Well it looks like we're going to get a white Christmas after all. Something wrong? - They're terrible. Everyone at the Beane Christmas dinner is gonna hate us. - Your chorus, you mean? - They sing off key and they can't remember the words. What am I going to do, mom? - Oh, I'm sure everybody will love them. - Even Happy's terrible. In fact, he's the worst. - Noelle, he can't do any better. He's old. - That's totally ageist, mom.

No one can replace your father, you know that. - It's just that I'm not sure Tom is dad material. That's all. - That's because you don't remember your father. You don't know what they're like. - I just want to make sure you know what you're doing. - You're going to have to take my word on that. - I'm sorry, mom. - It's okay. I miss your dad, that's all. - Me and my big mouth. I'm such a geek. - Noelle, it's all right. Noelle. Oh. (sighs) Teenager. (bright, quirky music) (tires skidding) (Jake gasps) (bright, quirky music) (Jake grunts) (panting) - Come on, come on. Come on. (tires skidding) (Jake sighs) (upbeat, quirky music) (wind blowing) - Hey, mom? There's a light in the house across the road. - What? - There's somebody in there. - But it's abandoned. (upbeat, quirky music) (wind blowing) (rustling) You trespassing? That's a little extreme. I just want to know if you're trespassing. - I didn't mean to. - Are you the one that's been breaking into places around here? - Look, I had car trouble. By the time it got fixed, it was snowing so hard. I missed the road on the way to my hotel and I skidded into a ditch. I was looking for some help. - I think we better go back to my place and call the sheriff. - I am not a criminal. That happens to be my car outside. Now would a thief drive a car like that? - Only if he stole it. Come on. Come on! (Jake sighs) (wind blowing) Go on. (door slams) - Wow. - [Emma] This will only take a minute. (Jake sighs) - Does your mom know you're a criminal? - I'm not a criminal. - Hi Tom. It's me. I caught someone breaking into the place across the road. - You look like a criminal. - Well I've had a bad day. - [Emma] What's your name? - Jake Peterson. - Jake Peterson. - I work for the Cobra Farm Corporation. I'm here on business. - He says he's a businessman. He's in snakes or something. I thought maybe he was your burglar. Do you have any ID? - Of course I have ID. Uh... Look, my wallet must've fallen out. - No ID. Tom, I am not going to do that. (sighs) The sheriff says I have to search you. - Lady, I'm an executive. - I'm the Pope. Just don't make any funny moves. (quirky music) I'm gonna feel around. - You better listen to her. The sheriff's her boyfriend. - Ah, ah, ah. You missed a spot. - That's all right. Yeah. There's nothing on him. What? Well are you sure? Well, what am I supposed to do? Tom, I can't do that. It's freezing out there. Yeah. All right. Yeah. I promise. Bye. Well, it seems that the roads are closed on account of the snow. Sheriff says I should tie you up and put you in the barn till he can get here tomorrow, but I think that's a little excessive. You're going to have to stay with us tonight. - Oh, thank you. (quirky, mysterious music) (wind whistling) Look, Mrs. Murphy. I assure you I am not a thief. Now, why don't you just call down to the new Athens hotel. I'm sure they have a reservation in my name. - Well, that would just prove that you plan your crimes ahead. Hope you like meatloaf, Mr. Peterson. - Not as much as I'd like to get cleaned up right now. - Cleaned up? - Oh, well, in case you hadn't noticed, I'm filthy. - Oh, we've noticed all right. But it's not polite to say anything. You know, just in case you've had a bad childhood or something. - Oh, believe me, my folks have nothing to do with how I turned out. - It doesn't mean you're unredeemable. - Noelle. - Oh, thank you. I'm certainly glad someone has faith in me. - I work at the old people's home. It's volunteer. But when I'm 16, they'll pay me. If I can get a job, you can. - Noelle, we don't even know who he is yet. He might be telling us the truth. - Gee, does that mean you're going to let me get cleaned up? - Sure. The bathroom's upstairs. Just leave your clothes outside the door and I'll throw them in the wash. - Thank you. (bright, upbeat music) (knocks) - Mr. Peterson, I left you some clean clothes. (knocks) Mr. Peterson? (Jake sighs) (Jake yells) I knocked, I thought... - I didn't hear you. (sighs) (laughs) There, see? Now do I look like a felon? (silverware clatters) - Woo hoo. - Noelle. Please. - You're cute. - I'm glad someone thinks so. - I mean it. You're a total fox. (laughing) - What? She doesn't even know what a fox is. - Everybody knows that mom. - Yes, well not in my house. - Well, thanks for the clothes. Look, do we, do we really need to keep this thing out? - I guess not. - Thanks. - But don't try anything funny. She knows how to use it. - Okay. Sit down. - Where'd you learn to shoot? - My husband. - Oh, you scared him off, huh? - No, he's dead. - Oh. I... I'm sorry. - Thanks. - If you're not a criminal, then how come you broke into that house instead of coming over here? Our light was on. - Well, I um, I didn't want to bother anybody. Look, I know what you're thinking, but I came to Athens on business. I swear. The company I work for is interested in buying some farm equipment from Beane's. - From Beane's? - [Jake] Uh yeah. - Equipment? - Yeah. (chuckles) Oh, we have land all over the west and we grow corn and soybeans and that sort of thing. I came here to see if the Beane plant could handle an order for a fair number of tractors. - What's a fair number? - Uh, say, 80. - 80? - Does that sound like too many? - 80 tractors? - Well does it sound like too few? - It sounds like a miracle. Are you serious? - Do I sound like it? - Are you always this insecure? - Oh, well, I'm new at this job and if I pull it off, I get a big promotion, so I just wanted to make a good impression. - Oh, you're making an impression, all right. You know, I can arrange a meeting for you with the head of production at Beane's. - You can? You know him? - Yeah, I know him. You could say we're pretty close. - Really? - I work at Beane's. - You do? Isn't that wonderful? What a coincidence. - Isn't it? Well, I've got to go do some chores and just in case this is all a dream, I'd like you to come with me. - Oh, I understand. I'll help you. - You don't look much used to hard work. - Well, I'm a quick learner. - All right, come on. (bright, upbeat Christmas music) (Emma gasps) (Jake grunts) (horse whinnies) Okay, you can a muck out the empty stall. There's a pitchfork right there. - [Jake] Hey. - Here you go guys. - You raise animals, huh? - Oh, no. I kind of just take them in. This horse was left at the vets. He was half starved. The goats came from a farm that went bankrupt and the potbelly pig out there, he just showed up on the doorstep one day. (Jake chuckles) - Well I admire people who aren't afraid of hard work. - So do I. - Oh. Uh, here? - Yeah. That's it. You want some apple? Here you go, sweetie. - You know what happened to those people who used to live across the road? - Uh, sort of, not really. The place has been empty ever since we moved in here. - How many years is that? - Oh... About six, why? - Nice house. - It was. (phone ringing) - Merry Christmas. - Noelle, it's Tom. Let me speak to your mom a minute. - Oh, she's in the barn. - She's where? - She's in the barn. - Alone? - She's not alone, she's with Jake. They're doing chores. He's really great. And he looks completely different without his clothes. I gotta go. See ya. - Dave? We've got an emergency out at Emma's. Do me a favor, would you? Call the highway department, see how long it's going to be before the plows get through out there. - [Jake] You work this whole farm all by yourself? - [Emma] Uh, nights and weekends. During the week I drive a forklift at Beane's. - [Jake] Oh. So how is it working at Beane's? - [Emma] I don't know. I've never worked any place else. My brother works there, my dad. He's the head of production. - Oh. - He loves that place. It's like a second home. Hi buddy. You just pour that in that bucket right there. - [Jake] Runs uh, runs a tight ship. Huh? - [Emma] Mm-hm. Everybody who works for him just loves him. - Oh, it's not so important that the workers love you. What's important is that they do their jobs efficiently. - Where did you hear that? - Well, I happen to have an MBA from Northwestern. - I happen to have a VCR from Japan. Doesn't mean I know how to use it. You don't know much about business, do you? (Jake laughs) If the employees don't admire and trust the boss, they don't work as well, see? - Well sometimes the boss has to do things he doesn't want to do. Things that workers wouldn't like for the good of the company. - Thanks. That never happens here. That's why Beane's is such a great place to work. - Nobody says things like that anymore. - We do, here in Athens. Mr. Peterson, we can fill that order of yours for 80 tractors, easy. - You think so? - Oh, I know so. People in this town like working hard. Makes them feel good about themselves. They take a lot of pride in their work and they'll do anything to keep this plant open. - Oh. Is it in danger of being closed? - Not anymore. (soft music) - That's King Wenceslaus right there. Okay, so, he like looks out his window one night, see? And there's this guy walking through his forest. But this is like illegal or something, so his guards get all concerned. But he says let's invite that homeless man to dinner. Isn't that cool? - That is cool, yeah. - Those blisters should heal up pretty quick. - Thanks. - You know, Mr. Peterson, if you really want to get to know Beane's, you should come to our annual Christmas dinner. - Mom, he's from the city. He wouldn't want to come to our silly old dinner. - Well he might. It's a company tradition, and I know they would love to have you. We have a big potluck down at the rest home and everybody who works for Beane's is invited. - This year I'm in charge of the senior citizens chorus. Only don't expect much. (laughing) So, you ever think of becoming a dad? - Well, um, that's kind of personal. - I can't believe I said that. I'm a total banana. (Jake laughs) - Bedtime, Noelle. - How am I gonna face you in the morning? Oh! (Noelle grumbles) (door slams) - Goodnight. - Goodnight. - Teenager. - [Jake] It must be hard raising a kid all by yourself, Mrs. Murphy. - Oh, call me Emma. If you want to. - Emma. How did your husband die? You don't have to tell me if you don't want to, Emma. (Emma sighs) - Well I'm... I'm just not used to talking about it. He died in a car accident. It was snowing like this and it was around Christmas like now and his car went off the road, kind of like yours, only he wasn't lucky like you. - I'm sorry. - Me, too. We had all these plans. - You seem like the kind of person who'd be married again maybe. - Maybe. - Well, you seem like the kind of person who lands on her feet. You're intelligent, attractive. - True. (laughing) - Then why haven't you? - Too picky, I guess. (Jake laughs) - What about you? Are you married? - Me? No. No, no. - Well, how come? You're intelligent, attractive- - True. (laughing) - You're a good worker. A little slow, but thorough. (Jake laughs) And you're a good listener, too. And you ask the kind of questions that people like to answer. - Marriage is not for me. - Why not? - Well I've seen what it can do to two people when it doesn't work. - So are your parents still alive? - Uh, my mother is. And I don't know whether my father is or not. We moved away after the divorce and I tried to keep in touch with him, but it was hard. We argued a lot. And then a couple of years ago he just disappeared. I tried to find him for awhile and I just gave up. - So he doesn't know how you turned out? - No, he does not. - Well, it seems to me that you turned out pretty well. - You know, I've never told anybody that before. - Why not? - I was ashamed of myself, I think. - Why'd you tell me? - I don't know. (soft music) (Emma sighs) - It's bedtime. - Right, right. - I hope you'll be comfortable here, Mr. Peterson. - Oh, Jake. And I'm sure I will. - Well, goodnight Jake. - Goodnight, Emma. (chuckles) (soft acoustic music) (Jake sighs) - [Noelle] Breakfast is the most important meal of the day. - Yes, but I never do anything that has a saying attached to it. - Just try a little cereal. - Okay. - For me? - Mm. - You did it. See, it's not that hard. - Emma. - Don't talk with your mouth full. (grunts) - Emma, I uh, I wanted to do something for you to pay you back for taking me in last night. - You don't have to do that. - No, but I want to. If you hadn't found me, it would've been a very cold night. I owe you. - I can think of a few things. - So is your mom, uh, is she just dating this sheriff or she's serious about him? - [Noelle] She's serious. Everything my mom does is serious. - Yeah. My dad was like that. - Really? What'd your dad do? - He was a farmer. - Does he still have the farm? - I don't know. I don't even know where he is. - How come? - Oh, we moved away and I lost touch. Probably wouldn't even know him if I met him. - I never knew my dad. - Well, how do you feel about that? - It's weird because even though I never knew him, I still miss him. - Does your mom know about that? - No. Talking about him bothers her. - You know what I used to do when I missed my father? I used to pretend that he was sitting in the same room with me, and then I would talk to him as if he was right there. - You didn't feel like a total dark talking to a chair? (Jake laughs) - Well, later on, but not in the moment. - Maybe I'll try that. - Your dad must have been a very good man to have a daughter like you. - I wish he knew. (tractor puttering) - Hey Jake, I'm gonna go try to dig your car out. You wanna come? (tractor puttering) - How come you don't drive a Beane's? - They don't make one I can afford. If they had any brains at the corporate headquarters, they'd make an economy model for folks like me. (tractor puttering) - There it is! - Jake, sit down! - There it is! - Sit down! Jake! (Jake yells) Jake! Jake? Come on, they're not broken. They're just bruised a little. - A little? - Don't be a baby. - Ow. It hurts. - You'll get over it. - You're very comforting. - Thank you. I try to be useful. Jake, about those tractors that you want being built for you, I've been thinking about it- - Look, look, we don't have a deal yet. - Well, I know we can do it and we can give you a great price to boot. - Yeah, but there's a lot of details to work out. You know, and the business world is very risky. See, one minute you got to deal- - I lied to you before. We are in trouble. Beane's wants to downsize us. Half this town will be out of a job. - You know? - Well, everybody knows. Jake, if you give us this contract, you could save this town. - Emma. There's something that I want to tell you... (door opens) - Oh. Excuse me. - Don't shoot him. - I didn't bring my gun. - Tom. Tom. Tom, this is Jake. Jake, this is Tom. Sheriff Tom. - [Tom] Her fiance. - Right. My fiance. - Mr. Peterson, you're gonna have to come with me. - You can't take him. - Noelle, just to calm down. - It's illegal to break into somebody's house, Noelle. - Mom, do something. - Tom. Tom, you're making a big mistake. Jake is going to save our town. - You know, I don't care if he's going to save the whales. This guy is guilty of trespassing. - Jake, I'm sorry, I- - I'll be okay. I can clear this all up with just one phone call. - I'll come visit you in jail. - Tom is not putting him in jail. Tom is driving him to his hotel, got it? So that Jake can call the big corporation he works for who wants us to build 80 tractors for them and tell them the deal is on. Got it? So that headquarters will see we're the most productive branch they've got. Got it? - Got it. I guess we can talk about this later. - Right. But for now I need you two out of here. I gotta make some phone calls. - Come on Mr. Peterson. You staying at the Athens? - Right. Uh, Emma. Thank you. - Thank you. (soft music) (Emma sighs) - Hey mom? - Hm? - Were you and Jake kissing? - Absolutely not. Where did you get an idea like that? - I knew it. You like him. Sometimes I'm so smart, I surprise myself. (car starts up) (soft music) - [Tom] Sorry about the mix-up back there, Mr. Peterson. I was just doing my job. - [Jake] I understand perfectly. I'm just glad it all worked out. - So what's all this about you saving the town? - Oh, the company I work for has a big order. - [Tom] You know, you couldn't have picked a better group of folks than the ones at Beane's. - Morning, Tom. - [Tom] Morning Betsy. - [Jake] Well, I haven't really made a decision yet. - Oh, you'll pick Beane's. Little joke there. (Jake laughs) - There are many qualified companies. - Yeah, but none like Beane's. - And of course the final decision is not up to me. - You'll convince 'em. Especially once you see our plant. - Don't tell me you work there too. - No, but my mom does and seven brothers and sisters. Grandpa did, my uncle did- - That's all right. I get the picture. - Look, I'll have one of the guys dig your car out of the ditch out there and bring it into town. - [Jake] Thanks very much. - Well, here's your hotel. And listen, just so you know, if I catch you doing anything illegal, I'll warn you 10, maybe 20 times then I'll have to crack down. I can't show favoritism. - Thanks, Tom. - You bet. Have a good day. (people chattering) - There you go. Careful, it's hot. - Margie? - Yeah? - Margie, has my dad been in for lunch yet? - He got his to go. - Okay, now listen. If a very handsome guy in a suit comes in here, be real nice to him. I mean real nice. - What's up? - He's here to check out Beane's. He's got an order for 80 tractors and he needs somebody to build 'em. - 80 tractors? - Oh my. - And get him to try your apple pie. - I sure will. Hey everybody, listen up. Did you hear the news? - What's that? - Mrs. Murphy told me all about your terrible ordeal. Thank the Lord she rescued you. - You don't by any chance moonlight at Beane's, do ya? - No, I moonlight here. Beane's is my main job. I'm a welder. Been there 12 years. I love it. Yeah. Just love it. It's so nice to have you here. If there's anything I can do for you, you just let me know. - Um, I'm having some money wired to me. Can you let me know when it arrives? - [Receptionist] The minute it gets here, I'll bring it up personally myself. - That's all right. Just call. I'll come down. - Anything you wan, Mr. Peterson. And Mr. Peterson? Thank you. - For what? - Being here. It sure is going to lift people's spirits. (soft tense country music) (upbeat, quirky music) (people chattering) - Oh that's Mr. Peterson. - Oh, hi. - [Woman] That's that man. - Hi. - [Woman] Hello, sir. (people chattering) (upbeat quirky music) - [Woman] Hello there. - [Man] Guy who's gonna make us rich. - He's our hero. - Good to see you here. (people chattering) - I was watching TV the other day. It was the biggest thing you ever saw in your life. - Really? - Oh yeah. (door chimes) (people chattering) (soft, upbeat music) (people whispering) - Yeah, you're right. Oh my. - Hi. Welcome to the Athens Country Cafe. Um, may I interest you in some of my homemade pie? I win the prize for it at the county fair every year. Oh, I bet you'd like some coffee. - No. No coffee. I'm trying to watch the caffeine. - Oh. - Um... You wouldn't by any chance happen to have a Caesar salad on your menu, would you? - Caesar salad? - Yeah. - No, we have a nice chef salad, but I'll tell you what, I'll call around and see if anybody has a good recipe. I'll whip you up a Caesar in no time. - No, don't bother. Chef salad will be fine. - Are you sure? - I'm sure. - Well coming right up. I'm going to make it myself. Harold. (people chattering) - Mr. Peterson. I'm Joe Marsdon, Emma's brother. - Oh, hi. - Mr. Peterson, what you're doing for this town is nothing short of heroic. - Well, I haven't even been out to the plant. - I know, I know, but you'll see. We got the best workforce in this whole darn country. You can bet on that. We'll show you. Margie, put Mr. Peterson's lunch on my tab. - It's on the house. - But I want to pay for it. - You don't have to. - Well, I beat you to it. - I got to do something for him. - No, you don't. - Well think of somethin' else. - Really, you don't have to do anything, really. - This hat was my grandfather's. It's been in my family three generations. It's my most prized possession. (people chattering) - [Man] We'd like to thank you for all you're doing. - [Woman] He's so good looking. - [Emma] Tom. Have you seen Jake? - [Tom] Not since I dropped him at the hotel. - Thanks. - Emma. Come back here a minute. Is there anything that you want to tell me? - Like what? - You know... - No, I don't know. - You know, Emma, I know what it's like to meet somebody who seems kind of rich. - Oh Tom. - Just because he's different, it doesn't make him better. - Oh Tom. - Forget about this guy, will ya? I mean, you don't even hardly know him. - Oh, Tom. - What? - How could you even think I'd be interested in a guy like that? - Well it sure looked that way. That man could single-handedly save this town. - That doesn't mean you have to make a fool out of yourself chasing after him. - I was just being polite. - I'll say. - I was making him feel at home. - So this is just an act? - Of course it is. I hardly even know the guy. How could I be in love with someone I hardly even know? - Oh, you're in love with him now? - How could you say such a thing? - I didn't, you did. - I am not in love with anybody. Well, except you, of course. Um... I got to go. I'll see ya. - All right. - See you later. - Thank you. - It's cold out here. - Have a nice day! - I will. - [Man] Bye. - I've been looking all over for you. You're late for your meeting. - What meeting? - At Beane's. - What, now? - No time like the present. Nice hat. - How about tomorrow? I mean, I have to recover from my ordeal and I was hoping to have a little fun. - Fun, huh? - Oh yeah. I mean, you do have fun here, don't you? So why don't you call in sick and show me around town? - Okay. - Okay. (soft, bright music) - [Emma] So, are you recovered? - Absolutely. I can't remember when I had such a good time. Certainly not since I was a teenager. - Well, I'm glad. So, I'll meet you bright and early for breakfast. - Emma, uh, wait. - Yes? - I um... (Jake sighs) - Yes? - I had fun. - Me, too. - [Jake] Good. - Well, I'll see you tomorrow. - [Jake] Yeah. (soft music) (truck starts up) (soft music) (upbeat Christmas music) (people chattering) - Bundled up. Thanks for coming again. Bye. Take care now. Bye. - Bye. - [Man] Bye, Jake. - [Margie] Ooh, it's cold. - [Jake] Bye now. - [Emma] Bye. - Bye. (laughs) (upbeat horn music) - You'll be able to run for mayor after this. - Emma, listen to me. - Wait till you see our operation out there, Jake. You won't be able to say no. - Emma, wait. - I know what you're going to say. And I want you to know that I know it didn't mean anything. - What didn't? - Yesterday and the day before that. - Yes it did. (Emma sighs) - But we're not important. - Yes we are, and that's why I got- - Jake. It's impossible. I'm corn and cows and tractor parts and you, you're... You're Chicago and noise, traffic, parties and culture. I mean, can you honestly say you're willing to give that up? - I'm not sure what I want anymore. - What does it matter? You're in a position to do some real good here, Jake, and I'm not going to let any silly feelings get in the way of that. If you want to do something for me, then do something for this town. Then you can go back to your big city and I can go back to my little farm. We can write Christmas cards and wonder if we should have changed our lives. That's how these things go. - I had no idea you were so cynical. - Well, sometimes it's called for. (people chattering) (people chattering) (machines whirring) - Yeah, I don't see why not. Yeah, I can let you have a couple of men, Essie. They can get that job done in an hour and be back at the plant here before anybody misses them. Yep. Very good. All right. It's a deal. See you in the morning. Hello there. - Dad, this is Jake. Jake, this is my dad, Cal. - Hi, Cal. - I better get to my station. - I've heard a whole lot about you. - What was that you were doing on the phone just now? - Oh, barter system. Essie bakes all the bread for the Beane Christmas dinner every year for free in exchange for help on her house. It's good PR for the company and we get something back for it. - And your superiors are aware of that? - Oh, well, sometimes you have to do a little creative thinking to keep things running, you know? - Yeah. - I got to check on the line. Do you want to come with me? - Sure. - Here you go. (people chattering) (machines whirring) - Who did you say you work for? - Cobra Farm Corporation. - Cobra Farm Corporation. Ah, never heard of that one. - We have land all over the west. - Oh, the west, huh? - Yeah. Our machinery is outdated. We're looking to modernize. - [Cal] Modernize, huh? - [Jake] Yeah. - Beane's is not like other corporations. You see, here at Beane's, we recognize the importance of the worker. Loyalty, job, security. These things increase productivity. Now a lot of other companies have downsized. You could say they're no better off now than they were before they did it, and that's a fact, son. - How do you know that? - Ever hear of a paper called the Wall Street Journal? - Yes I have. - I read it every day. You have to do a little arithmetic. You can put that in your notes. - [Jake] I hear the company is having financial problems. - [Cal] Where'd you hear that? - From your daughter, as a matter of fact. - Well son, Beane's Tractor has been on the planet for 60-odd years and that's because they recognize that just because you decrease expenses doesn't mean you increase sales. You got that? - Sure. - They pay decent wages and in return, they get productive workers who buy Beane's. Right? Now in recent times, recent years, price has gone up, that's getting harder to do. I don't deny that. What do you think? - Well, I am impressed. - Good, good. - Look, we're coming through! - Now are you ready to tell me the truth? - Excuse me? - Son, I wasn't born yesterday. Nobody sends their rep out three days before Christmas on an order of this magnitude. Most plants are shutting down about now. That's just business sense. - How's it going? - Fine. Just fine. I think we have an understanding. - [Jake] Emma... - You want to tell her, or should I? - Emma, I don't work for a farm corporation. I don't have an order for 80 tractors. I don't even have an order for one. - What? - He works for Beane's. He came here to downsize the plant. He's the man who will decide who stays and who goes. - Oh, I don't believe this. - Look, I tried to tell you- - You lied to us? - Emma, just listen to me. - You let us believe that you were going to save us. - [Jake] Emma. Emma! - It appears she's keen on you. Or should I say was. (melancholy music) (patrons chattering) (Christmas horn music) (man clears throat) (Christmas horn music) - Excuse me. Excuse me? Can I get a cup of coffee and donut please? (Christmas horn music) (clattering) (Christmas horn music) Thank you. - Joe, what'll it be? - Just the coffee Margie. To go. I don't think I care to stay. - I was just doing my job. - That includes making fools out of all the folks in this town that trusted you? I guess you're doing it well. - This company is in a financial crisis, you know. Would you rather have it shut down altogether? - Maybe that ought to start downsizing their corporate headquarters. Get rid of some of those extra executives, that ones that make three times what we do? They can start with you. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Maybe they ought to come down on their prices. Beane tractors aren't for the little guy anymore. Maybe then there'd be more business. - There's lots of other ways to work it so you don't have to fire people. Job sharing and what all. Read the New York Times. They talk about that stuff all the time. - I am not chairman of the board. I work at Beane's, just the same as you do. There's nothing I can do about this. (patrons chattering) - Refill? Oops. Sorry. (soft Christmas horn music) (trombone blares) - Make up the room yourself. - Okay. Thank you. Merry Christmas. (door slams in the distance) (Jake sighs) - I'll have your room made up in no time, Mr. Peterson. I'm very sorry about this. By the way, sir. My name is Watson. Delmar P. Watson. You know, night shift at Beane's. I'll take a wage cut, sir. I don't mind. Just don't take away my job. Please. I have four children and a mortgage. (chuckles) One of my kids wants to be a veterinarian. You know how much money it costs to go to veterinarian school? I'll have your room right away, sir. I'll do it myself. - Oh, no, don't. Don't don't bother Mr. Watson. - Delmar P. Watson. --- - It's fine just the way it is. - Yes, sir. If there's anything you want, you just let me know. - I'd just like to be alone. - Oh, sure. Of course. Right away. Sorry. (melancholy music) - [Emma] Merry Christmas. - [Noelle] Merry Christmas. - [Emma And Noelle] We can't take your call right now so please leave a message after the beep. - [Noelle] And please recycle your Christmas boxes.

(bright, upbeat Christmas music) Hey, hi, Noelle. Look, would you just to what I have to say? You see, I'm sorry about the way things turned out, but I was forced to do it. You see, my company, they didn't want anybody to know who I was. You know, I bet this is the first time anybody's been shunned for not being a criminal, huh? - Adults are supposed to be examples for young people such as myself. Is this the kind of behavior you'd want the youth of America to emulate? - Hey, I have faults. - Duh! - Well I'm sorry. But I need your help. I need to talk to your mom. - She doesn't want to see you ever again. - Yeah, I know. See that's why I have to talk to her. - What's she going to do without a job? I can't support the two of us. - I'm not going to fire your mother. Is that what she thinks? - That's what everybody thinks. - Oh man, this thing has gotten completely out of hand. - You said it. - But I have to talk to her. I have to explain. - You made her like you so she'd tell you everything that's going on at Beane's. You used her. - She likes me? Are you sure? - Yeah, I'm sure. - What about this Tom? - What about him? - I'm sure he's a very nice guy. He's just, he's not right for her. - He wouldn't make a great dad like you. - Wow. Thanks. So, does that mean you're going to help me? - You're trying to trick me. - No, I'm not. - How do I know that for sure? - You're going to have to trust me. You know, like you did the night we met. - And look how that turned out. - Now come on. Noelle, please. - I'll have to think about it. But right now I've got to go check on a real friend. (Jake sighs) (people chattering) How about this one? - I don't want to wear a tie. - You've got to, Hap. All the other men are going to be wearing them. - [Happy] But I'll choke to death. - My mom always says you have to suffer for beauty. I'll be right back. - [Happy] See ya. (soft music) (car starts up) - [Emma] Tom called. He wants me to stop by the jail. It'll only take a minute. - I don't mind. Oh, by the way, Jake came by today. - Why? - He wanted me to help him get you to talk to him. - He's got a lot of nerve. - He told me how much he liked you. Then he saw Happy and it was really weird. Looked like he'd seen a ghost. - He likes me? - Mom, you're not listening. - When on Earth did I ever fall for a man like that? Ugh, what is wrong with me? You think a person would have learned after all these years. - Mom? - What? - It's just hormones. You'll get over it. (bright, upbeat Christmas music) - [Emma] Where are we going somewhere? - Somewhere private. - What are you doing? - Emma, it's time you made a commitment to me. Now, I decided to forgive you for flirting with the man from Beane's. He's a slick character and you were fooled and I don't blame you, but it's time that you and I quit beating around the bush and got married instead of just talking about it. I want to set a date. - Oh, Tom. - Come on, January, February. You name it. - Oh, Tom. I can't marry you. I'm sorry. I thought I could. We're such good friends, I thought it would just work out, you know? But now... - You just don't have any feelings for me. - Not what I ought to. (soft music) (Tom scoffs) - I know. - You do? - Yeah. I've known for quite some time, it's just, I hoped it would change. (Tom scoffs) - We have such a good friendship. Let's not mess that up. (soft acoustic music) - Let's not. (soft acoustic music) - I was leaving for Chicago, but I just couldn't go until you hear what I have to say. - So you're gonna go back and get a big promotion for laying us all off? - I was just doing my job. - Is harassing us part of your job? - I'm not harassing you. - He's not harassing us, mom. - Noelle. Then what do you call this? - Asking for forgiveness. - He's just asking for forgiveness. - Come on Noelle, we've got gingerbread persons to make. - Look, I didn't want to lie to you. I realize now it was a mistake, but I couldn't let you know what I was really doing here, because I didn't want you to hate me. - But I do hate you. And that's my right. By not telling me the truth about yourself, you were taking away my rights. - Well let me make it up to you. - Fine. Go back to Chicago and tell them that everyone here is essential. - Emma, I can't do that. The numbers- - Do it for me. - Look, I run a business. - Yes. And badly. I'll tell you something, people in this state may be fools. They want to work. We'll do anything. We will work as long and as hard as you ask us to. - Well times have changed. We can't go and running these big oversized plants and losing money- - The only reason you're losing money is because you haven't got a clue who folks are down here. You don't make what people need. - You don't understand how hard it is to keep a business going these days. We have to make the tough- - Downsizing's not hard. Downsizing is easy. Making things work, that's what's hard. Jake. You're not the kind of person who lies to people and then betrays them, no matter what it's for. That's not the real you. - Well... Maybe it is. I'm sorry things didn't work out. - Me too. - Merry Christmas. Goodbye. - Bye. - Bye. She really fell for you, you know? You really blew it. (soft, melancholy music) (car starts up) (soft, melancholy music) You're in love with him, aren't you? - Hormones. I'll get over it. - True love doesn't come around but once or twice in a lifetime. - Where did you ever get a line like that? - Everybody knows that, mom. - It never would've worked out.

Ms. Stangle, your report please. - I went to the Beane's plant in Defiance, Illinois. The workforce is pretty efficient all the way around, but I noticed that a lot of couples work for Beane's. I would split these couples up, keeping one, laying off the other. That way, at least one person in each family will still have a job. - Excellent idea. That just takes some of the sting off it, huh? - George. - I've been to the plant in North Deer, Iowa. I recommend cutting anyone with seniority and bringing up the less skilled, cheaper labor. By doing this, I can cut costs by more than half. - Who'll teach them how to do their new jobs? - Oh. Well, that will require, um, someone from this office. - Does anybody here know how to operate a crane? - Jake. - Jake. Would you like to make your presentation now? (Jake clears throat) - I um, I was in Athens, Nebraska and uh, my suggestion is, um... I mean, I think we can cut corners... Look, I can't do this. I mean, we're talking about people's lives here. Whole towns. There's gotta be a better way. You take the people in Athens, for example. Most of the people in Athens have had worked at Beane's at some point in their lives. Half of them work there now. We downsize this plant, those people are going to lose their jobs. Property values will plummet. These people are going to move out of town. This town will be ruined. I can't... I can't let that happen. - What do you propose? - Well, it seems to me that the people of Athens are producing a product that's passe. - [Justin] What do you mean passe? - I mean they're making a product that's too big for the small farmer. They're making a product that they can't even afford to buy themselves and they make decent wages, as we all know. - We're in the tractor business, Jake. We make tractors. - But we could do so much more. We need to downsize our product, not our plants. We need to make what people can use and afford. Um, so I, uh, I have a plan. I propose that I take over management of the Athens plant. (laughs) Yeah you go ahead, you laugh. I want to introduce a versatile new product and I want to reassign jobs rather than eliminate people. - I hope your resume is up to date. - Now come on. Inside every American is a secret farmer waiting to buy his or her own Beane's mean machine, but they can't afford it. - It could be kind of cute. - And in addition, the Beane's Tractor Corporation would be known as the King Wenceslaus of the corporate world. You just think about that, Mr. Gosling. We could be a big corporation that people might actually feel good about. - Jake, you've never run a factory. - That's true. Mr. Gosling, you once told me that a man in a powerful position has to make difficult decisions. Well downsizing, that isn't difficult. Making things work, that's what's difficult. That's what I want to do. You said I have talent. Let me use that talent. Please. - Jake, would you please step out of the room for a minute? - Of course. (soft music) (wind blowing) (mysterious music) - That was a great speech you made. - Thanks. Am I out of a job? - I don't know. But look at it this way, at least you'll have a life. (chuckles) - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. - Jake, you can come back in now. - Thanks. (soft, tense music) - First time in my life I'm not looking forward to Christmas dinner. (people chattering) (soft music) - Mom. Mom. Mom. - What is it, honey? I'm busy. - Can you come here a minute? (Emma sighs) - Go ahead. I'll be fine. - Sure. - Merry Christmas. (soft music) - [Emma] They're beautiful. - You like them? Put them on. - I can't, honey. We're going to have to take them back. - But why? - Because I may not have a job anymore and we're going to need every cent that we have to make it to the winter. Put the box in a safe place and we'll take them back tomorrow. Noelle. Thank you. I've never had a nicer present in my life.

I'm glad to see how many of you were able to make it this year, particularly since you're aware that we may not be together next year. This dinner started way back that many years ago because we felt like a family, and now our family is being split up. (people chattering) - You got a lot of guts coming back here, son. - [Man] Got that right. - Listen, I know. I know how you all feel. - No you don't. But we're not going to talk business now. It's Christmas. We're going to have a nice meal, we're going to count our blessings and we're going to be charitable to our enemies. And that's it. Let's say grace. Lord, you test us all the time and right now you're testing us in any number of ways. We're going to be out of work pretty soon, and that's a test. And that's all on account of this young man that you brought to our table, and that's a test. But we're not going to toss him head first into the snow. I'm not going to put a laxative in his turkey dinner either. We're just going to endure his presence and try to get through it. In honor of you. Amen. - [All] Amen. - Um, ladies and gentlemen. Excuse me. (people chattering) I'd hate to interrupt, but uh, I have an announcement to make. I've just returned from Chicago where I was given the go ahead to implement a change of plan here at the Beane plant in Athens. I'm going to be taking it over. (people chattering) - Well, I'm sorry to burst your bubble, young man, but what do you know about running a plant? (Jake chuckles) - Absolutely nothing, which is why I'm going to need your help, Cal. And I am going to need everybody's help because we are going to produce a new line. A new line of economy tractors with plows, and nobody is getting laid off. (clapping) (cheering) - That's pretty good. - I'll drink to that. (cheering) (clapping) - It's not my idea. It's the brainchild of one of Beane's new managers. She's sitting right over there. Emma Murphy. (clapping) (people chattering) Now folks, we have got one year to turn this plant around. - Yeah, well we can do it. - Yeah. - We'll do anything to keep Beane's open. - If we all pull together, I know we can do it because Athens is a wonderful, wonderful place and it's filled with wonderful people. Anyway. Merry Christmas. (clapping) - Merry Christmas. - Down here, son, we got a lot to talk about. This is Hap on your left here. - Jacob? (soft music) Jacob? Is that you? - Yeah, pop. It's me. - Jake! Oh, Jake. Oh, I was so stupid. - Oh, I tried to find you. I came by the old house. - Too ornery for my own good. - No, I'm sorry. - So am I. - [Jake] Come on, sit down. (soft orchestral music) - This here is your son, Hap? - Yep, my son. (Jake chuckles) Nice suit. (Jake laughs) - [Jake] Thanks. - I'm real proud of you, son. - Thanks, pop. - Mom and Tom broke up. (soft music) (Tom laughs) (soft music) (people chattering) - Emma, I- - I can't believe you came back here. - Well I had to see you. (soft music) (Jake sighs) - Just gonna let her go? - I blew it, pop. - Too hard headed to make a fool of yourself, eh? - I can't make her want me. - Well you wanna repeat that past? You wanna end up like me willing to miss out on your son's life on account of my pride? - No. - Then take my advice, son. Make a fool of yourself. (soft music) - Hey. (Jake sighs) So... You and Tom split up, huh? - Yeah. - How come? - I just realized that although I love Tom very much, I don't love him the way that I love... The way that he needs. - I see. - So, you're moving to Athens? - Yeah. - That'll be a switch. - Phew, sure will. - Do you think you'll like it? - Well, you know, I spent so many years trying to be something other than who I really was that I kind of forgot myself. Maybe now I'll get my memory back. - Well, if you ever need any help, you know where to find me. I'm gonna go, I- - Emma. Can I come over sometime? - When? - Oh, maybe tomorrow night? And the night after that, and the night after that- - Jake. It's real nice of you to come back here and make amends and all, and everybody's real grateful. I just don't think that I can forgive you for what you did. - Maybe... Maybe we can just start over and get to know each other from scratch. Just take it real slow. - Do you think we could? - It's worth a try, isn't it? - Yeah. - Yeah. (soft, bright music) (people chattering) - [Happy] Oh, it's wonderful. - [Noelle] Wonderful. (Happy blows nose) - Oh, I forgot to give you your Christmas present. (people chattering) (paper rustling) - [Woman] These presents are all from Happy. (people chattering) - It's the angel from the post office. - I found it. Thought it could use a good home. - Happy. Where did you get this? - All over. Angels all over town this time of year. I wanted to give them to those who need 'em most. (people chattering) - My god, Happy's the Christmas burglar. (laughing) He gave me my angel back. (laughing) - Grown ups.
