Nash, that covers about everything. You have your instructions and your credentials. Yes. They're all in here. I'd better get my tickets. If Dr. Wong's invention is half as good as he claims, the manufacturing rights will be worth millions. The American Electric Company can't afford to lose out. Yes, sir. No, sir. I'm new in China. You had three years in the consular service. You know the country, the language and the manner of doing business here. That's why I'm sending you in my place. Considering everything, I'm sure you'll represent the company better than I. Well, I can die trying, sir. “Die“? You're not sick, are you? Oh, no, sir. Didn't I hear something about your being sick the day before your wedding? Yeah. It... It happened twice. That's why I didn't get married. Carol... Um, Miss Fortescue felt... Well, you can imagine how she felt. Yeah. You see... Discouraged. Yes. Sol resigned and went to America to the finest specialists. Well, they get you all cleaned out all right? Every nickel. That's fine. Well, good-bye, Nash. Good-bye. Sorry, madam. There are no trains to Wu-Hu. You said that three or four times. I must get there. It's very important for me. Money's no object. Madam, if I owned the rail road, I'd give you a train. But a bridge has washed out, and our engines can't swim. - Wu-Hu. - I beg your pardon? A compartment to Wu-Hu, please. Sorry. There's been an accident on the line. Accident? Yes, sir. Do you know whether Sir Mortimer Fortescue and his daughter... Their train was the last one to get through, sir. Oh, that's fine. It looks as though I'll have to try and make it in my car. It's a hard, long trip, sir. Don't I know it. Excuse me. Pardon me. Do you mind? Oh. That's all right. Aren't you the gentleman who's driving to Wu-Hu? Yes. I'm most anxious to go myself. I mean, wouldn't you take me along? I'm afraid not. It's no trip for a girl. Bad roads and the desert. That sounds interesting. It isn't. I couldn't take the responsibility. I'll take the responsibility. Pardon me just a moment. You forgot to sign it. Sign it “American Electric Company.“ Couldn't you possibly take me with you? Yes, but... No. Won't you change your mind? It's a 24-hour trip. That's only a day. A day and... and a night. I'm not afraid of the dark. Are you? No. I'm afraid of what might happen in it. Whoo-hoo. Whoo-hoo. Wu-Hu! Wu-Hu! Daily Mail' W u - H u! Wu-Hu! Wu-Hu! I haven't seen so many big shots since the peace conference. That guy's invention must be plenty hot to drag us from all over the world like this. How do you do? Who? You, sir. How do you do? You're Sir Mortimer Fortescue of Shanghai, are you not? You're mistaken. I am. - What is your opinion of Dr. Wong? - Wong? The man you came here to see. See? About what? About his invention. Oh, yes. What is your opinion of his invention? Absolutely worthless. The invention? No. My opinion. Come on, Daddy. Good afternoon, sir. Did you have a nice trip? I always have a nice trip. You are... General Nicholas Baronosky Petronovich. Formerly of the Russian Imperial Guard. At present, general manager of the Moscow Utilities Company. Are you interested in Dr. Wong's new invention? I am here to buy the rights for my company. Who's that bird? Must be Herr von Baden of the Berlin Lens and Optical Company. Would you say a few words, please? No, no, no, no. No, no. In English, please. In German or in English... out of the way! I have business. Skittish. Very skittish. Yeah, and just a wee bit squirrelly too. Dr. Bums! Dr. Bums! Dr. Burns! Man inside, him very sick. I take you. What's the matter? Oh, Doctor, I'm sick. I cannot “up-standing“ straight. You can't what? I cannot up-standing straight. Well, let me see. Uh... Oh, look. Your... Look. Your vest is buttoned to your trousers. Ah! Oh, thank you, Doctor. Ah! Thank you. This is the hotel manager. Dr. Wong. Dr. Wong. Dr. Wong, I have a telegram for you. I'm afraid I have a short circuit in my transformer. That's very unfortunate, I'm sure. But, uh, how about this telegram? Ah, right. There is a short circuit. Oh, were you saying something? Why, yes. I have a short circuit... Huh? I mean, I have a telegram for you. Read it, please. “Leaving Shanghai to negotiate blonde on desert, “but will not take responsibility. “Hold everything. Signed, American Electric Company.“ Ah. The American representative. Is, uh, the telegram quite clear to you, Doctor? Quite, quite. Clever people, these Americans. Always combining business with pleasure. Oh, uh, General Petronovich requested me to, uh, arrange an interview with you this afternoon. I will see no one until the arrival of the American representative. Well, I hope he'll be here in time for your demonstration. Thank you. And now... you will be the first to witness the wonders of my radioscope. Uh, pull those curtains, please. Yes, Doctor. Oh, Doctor, this is positively thrilling. I'm gooseflesh all over. ♪♪ What are you going to show me, Doctor? The six-day bicycle race in New York City. Watch closely. ♪ But wait till tomorrow 'ere you take... ♪♪ Not quite synchronized. Seems rather, uh, mixed-up. Yes. That moo went with the cow. I believe that is the customary procedure. Professor Henry R. Quail takes off from Juarez, Mexico, on a secret mission, combining business with pleasure. Delicious. 200 pesos. Charge it. I wonder if the professor can get off the ground with that load. Now I will get you the six-day bicycle race. If the doctor will permit, a little later perhaps. Oh, at your pleasure. It will be going on for six days. Good afternoon, Doctor. Good afternoon. Oh, hello. Come here. Say, who's that? “Who is that?“ That's the manager of the ho... Well, you wouldn't know. What difference does it make? Good afternoon, Doctor. Good afternoon. I have an invitation for you. Oh, thank you. Dr. Wong is going to show his radioscope on the roofgarden tonight. Thank you very much. Oh, goody! “Goody“? You're not invited. Oh, that's too bad, Doctor, because you would've enjoyed it. Listen, I've had enough of this. I've got a good mind to get a different nurse. No, no. Don't do that, Doctor. This one is different enough. Well, then you talk to her. Thanks. Do you know, you're very smart. Yes, I know. To what do you attribute your smartness? Uh, three things. Three things? Oh. First, my very good memory. Mm. And the other two things, um, uh... I forgot. Look, uh, let me talk to her. Thanks. What the manager would like to know is, did you ever go to school? Oh, yes, I did. Well, what school did you go to? I'm not allowed to tell. You're not allowed to tell? The school pays me $25 a week not to tell. You take her. Thanks. Did, um... Did you ever read any books? Oh, of course I did. Did you ever read any books by Kipling? No. No, I never read any of his books. I like his herring though. Mm-hmm. Uh... This one is on me. - You like Kipling's herring? - Yes. Sometime when you have nothing to do, you must read some of Dill's pickles. - You'd like that too. - Oh,yeah? Well, I'll get it. Get that. This Monday, a new pickle is coming out with a blue cover. Oh, yeah? A mystery, huh? If you don't mind. Well. Uh, this one in on the house. You know, something must have happened to you when you were a baby. No. No, nothing happened to me, but something happened to my brother when he was a baby. Oh, to your brother. Yes. My father took him for a stroll in the carriage. But when my father came home, he had a different baby in a different carriage. Different baby in a different carriage. Yes. What did your mother say? Oh, she didn't say anything, because it was a better carriage. Oh. Uh... I'm coming. A better carriage, huh? Yes. And the baby my father brought home was a little French baby. A little French baby. Yes, so my mother took up French. Took up French. Yes. To be able to understand the baby... when it started to talk. When it started to talk. Yes. Oh, they're crazy people. What about these eggs? What about the eggs? Well, what about the eggs? Are they finished? They're finished. Try it again. Listen, when you invited me to ride... Pardon me. You invited yourself. You told me we could cross this moth-eaten desert in 24 hours. I told you we could if we got a break. You got a break... miles away from everywhere. And you spend half the night feeling around in the dark for nuts and bolts. Aw, fry an egg. Take your dirty hands off my lingerie. I'll take care of this. You start the engine, and hurry. What's your tearing hurry to get to Wu-Hu? Business. Business? Dr. Wong's invention is going to make millionaires, and I intend doing the same. You mean you're gonna marry a millionaire? I never marry anything else. Wil lyou hurry? Say, if my girl ever finds out I spent a night on the desert with another girl... Oh, don't tell her. She might think you're having a good time. “Good time.“ Lady, I wouldn't enjoy a minute of this trip... even if you were Peggy Hopkins Joyce. I am Peggy Hopkins Joyce. Huh? This is as far as we go. That's good news. I hope you had a nice trip. Mmm. I hope there's a chiropractor in the hotel. Where's a garage? Down there. You catching nice A-number-one wife, mister. You catch 'um suitcase and do A-number-one scram. There are twin beds in the room at present. Shall I have one of them removed? Remove both of them. Both? I prefer a double bed. Don't you? So! Nicky. Your husband. No husbands at present. We're divorced. Didn't I get a divorce from you in Paris? Ah! That means nothing. In my country, you're still my wife. Oh, Nicky, darling, don't go dramatic on me. Everything is finished. Never. Any man that comes between us, he will be finished. Undoubtedly, General. I delivered your message to Dr. Wong. Well? He will talk to no one about the radioscope until after the arrival of the American representative. Nicky, are you interested in the radioscope? Interested? I'm going to buy it. It will make millions for me. Millions? Oh, Nicky, darling. Do you wish to go to your room now, Miss Joyce? Yes, thank you. Come along, Nicky, dear. Card. Tommy. You've come back. I missed you every hour I was gone. I thought I'd never see you again. Well, I'm here, and you're here, and here we are. It's wonderful. Marvelous. No, it isn't. It's disgusting. Carol. Carol. What's the matter? Ever since that day you left me waiting at the church... But I had the mumps. Yes. And the other time. You had, what was it? The chicken pox. A grown man like you always breaking out in children's diseases. But, Carol, that's all over now. I visited the finest specialists in the United States. I've been examined, x-rayed, violet-rayed and inoculated. I'm 100% perfect and immune to everything. Tommy. I got the papers to prove it... inoculation affidavits. Oh, Tommy, I'm so happy. Heh. Excusing, please, master. Your number-one wife, she going topside with another one man. Shh. Your wife? Mm, it's a mistake. She means the girl I... I traveled with. You traveled with a girl? Yes, but we're not married. Not married? Now, darling, you're wrong. It was all purely... platonic. Well, who is she? What's her name? Peggy Hopkins Joyce. And you were perfectly platonic with Peggy Hopkins Joyce. Now, dar... Wait. Who's there? It-it's me. Um, Tommy Nash. Oh, come in, dear. Oh, hello. Come and sit down. Um, Miss Joyce, this is Carol Fortescue, the girl I told you about. I'm afraid I'm intruding. Oh, not at all. How do you do? How do you do? Um, Miss Joyce, will you tell Carol... that practically the only thing we did on the desert was... fight? Oh, so that's it. Come and sit down, won't you? Tommy's a very nice boy. I only annoyed him. He loves you very much. Why, thank you. Missy, him belong you? Oh, Tommy, they must be yours. Uh, yes. That's funny. Very. Oh, Tommy. Oh. I'm so sorry. I packed these by mistake this morning in the desert. Why, we must have got our shorts tangled up. I__ I mean... Missy, you want me washee? I can tell you exactly what happened. Don't trouble. I can imagine. Now, Carol... “Purely platonic.“ You're gonna have to do something about this. I'll do my best, Tommy. Yeah. Carol! Carol. Carol. Carol, darling. I love you. It was her suggestion. Why, I kept thinking of you all the time. Why, she can't even cook. Yes, really, this is Dr. Burns's office. No, the doctor isn't in just now. Oh, he won't be back for a long, long time. He went out on one of those “eternity“ cases. Yeah, all right. Any calls for me while I was out, Miss Allen? Oh, yes, Doctor. My cousin just phoned. He wants you to come right over. He fell off an ironing board. Your cousin fell off an ironing board? Yeah. He was pressing his pants, and he forgot to take 'em off. Read your paper and don't annoy me, Miss Allen. Uh, have you seen my stethoscope? - Oh, not now, Doctor. I'll look at it later. - You'll look at it later? Yeah. Doctor, what's the difference between a helicopter and an autogyro? I don't know. You can't play a helicopter. You can't? Well, that certainly is a surprise to me. I knew it would be. What are you reading? I'm reading about this Professor Quail. - You know, he ﬂown the ocean. - He what? - He ﬂown the ocean. - No, no, no. He didn't "ﬂown". - You wouldn't say he has ﬂew? - He has ﬂu? You could never tell it by this picture. - Look. He has great big, fat cheeks... - Listen, Miss Allen, don't annoy me. - I know, but, look, he has big... - Stop. I have a very important appendicitis case on my mind. Oh, yeah? My brother had appendicitis. It left a very bad scar on his neck. - Appendicitis on the neck? - Yeah. - Appendicitis is on the stomach. - Yeah, I know. But he was so ticklish, they had to operate up there. Yes, I see what you mean. Couldn't take it. He'd have died laughing. Yes. We're glad anyhow he went to the hospital. Now there's more room for the old woman. Your mother, I guess? No, no. The old woman who's been living with us for five weeks. - Your aunt? - No. We don't even know her. Oh. A strange old woman lives in your house, and nobody knows her. Yeah. My brother won her at a raffle. Your brother won an old woman at a raffle? - Yeah. They ran a rafﬂe for a poor old woman... - And he won. - And he won. - I see. You certainly have a lot of fun home. You people live like fools. - Yeah. You know what happened last night? - What? Last night, in the middle of the night, my cousin woke up and gave out a big scream. Something happened, and she screamed right out, huh? She looked down at her legs, and they were all black. - Her legs turned black? - Yeah. - What did you do? - What did we do? We sent for a doctor, of course. - You sent for a doctor? - Of course. Well, what did the doctor do? Well, he took off her stockings, and then we all went to sleep again. Ah. Listen, Miss Allen. You're sitting on my stethoscope. Yeah... Oh, Doctor. Well, what are you doing? Oh, Doctor, I can hear my heartbeat. Yeah... Ooh! Carol! You've got to listen to me. No, I don't. Miss Joyce has explained everything to me. Sweetheart. Oh. Let's get married today, right away. - Won't you get sick again? - Oh, there's not a chance of that. - I'm immune. I've got papers that prove it. - Never mind, dear. - Tommy, your cheek. - What's the matter? - It's burning. - Oh, I'm just excited. And your hands, they're cold. Oh, Tommy, you're not going to get sick again? Aw, not a chance. I have papers that... Pardon me, but I happen to be the house physician. - Well, I have papers that prove... - I know, I know. Let me see your tongue. - Um, say "Ah". - Aw... No, no. Not "Aw". Say "Ah". Ah. Mm. I thought so. - Aw, now listen, Doctor. I've got... - I know. Measles, young man. Measles. I'll get my nurse. Miss Allen. Miss Allen. - Miss Allen. Miss Allen. - Yes? - There's a man outside with a rash. - With a rash? Is it this year's model? With freewheeling and floating power? - Or is it last year's... - No. It's a coupé. You know what a coupé is. Oh, sure. My father's got one. Only he parts his in the middle. He parts a cou... There's a man outside with a rash in the rotunda. Well, it certainly takes all kinds of people to make a world. - Don't you think so? - I think so. Measles! I had them when I was three years old. - It can't be the measles. I'm immune. - You're impossible. - Now, Carol... - Miss Allen, this is the patient. - Undress him and put him to bed. - Oh, Doctor. But, Doctor, I can't go to bed. I'm not married yet. - Undress him and put him to bed. - Oh, at his age. - Listen. - Carol, sweetheart... Tommy, don't you see? We'll never be married. You... You just can't stand the strain. - But, Carol, I can... - Come here. Take him. Listen... Oh, I love to hear of people getting married. You know, I had a wire from my sister today. She has a brand-new little baby. She's married, you know. She's married. Yeah. Oh. Is it a little girl or a boy? Well, I don't know yet, and I'm dying to find out whether I'm an uncle or an aunt. Hey. Hey, listen, Doctor. You've got my hat. Nash... the American representative. Serge, I have an idea. Where is the office of the health inspector? Are we going to talk to him?
