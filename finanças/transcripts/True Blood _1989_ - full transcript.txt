Do I get a hint? Well, 10 years ago he snuffed your partner. Are you sure? We just got a computer match on the prints we pulled from this room. Was it Trueblood who was bleeding? Hmm.

What else you got? Well, some loose change... Toothbrush, razor, and this. Frank Santos?Yeah. Son of a bitch. He's out there, Charlie. JOSEPH: The motherfucker is out there.

You left me! [BRAKES SCREECHING] Ten years, I didn't hear from you! Ten fucking years. And now you come back, and you want to be my brother? Donny, I don't expect you to forgive me, all right? I don't. But I swear to God, I had no choice but to leave. And the further I got from this place, the longer I was gone, the harder it was to get back. Bullshit, man!Wait a minute. That's the truth. I'm sorry, I got... I got hung up, man. I got... You get... I got caught up thinking about myself and I forgot what was important. Important things, like, like family, like brothers. and that's why I came back, Donny. I came back to get you because we're brothers. And nothing can change that. Nothing. [GRUNTING] Feel better?Not yet. [GRUNTING] Now I do. Now I do. You keep doing that, Donny, you're gonna bust your stitches. Come on. Come on, man. So, this is gratitude? I'm growing tired of playing nurse to the Truebloods. I don't know why I let you guys back in here. We'll get out of here. I'll get a key from Frank and we'll be out of here by tonight. Let's hope so. I gotta go. Thanks, nurse. JENNIFER: John Keats, 19th century poet. Died when he was 26. You nearly beat him. You must be hungry. Come on in the kitchen. I'll make you breakfast.

JOSEPH: Why don't you have another look. He'd be 10 years older now. Hey, I don't know the kid. I said I don't know. Is that a fact? Then maybe you can explain... What was he doing with your business card? Hey, I don't know. A lot of people got my business card. Here. Now you got one. Thanks, thanks a lot. [SNIFFLES] I tell you what, I got one for you too. That's just so you don't lose it. What do you think?Mmm. [SCOFFS] I think he's full of shit. Well, we can either stake the place out or you can go back and beat it out of him. Don't tempt me.[CHUCKLES] Look at this, look at this. Yeah. Wait a minute, what do you think, huh? I don't know. It's worth a shot. CHARLIE: Jeez, that's a nasty habit. Joe. I think I got something. Bingo. Freddy, take a break. I wanna talk to Ray. What's up? You didn't tell me you were in trouble with the police. They're after you and your brother, Ray. They say you killed a cop.

It ain't no life. And you can't stay in this city, Donny. Don't you understand that? Because if Masters don't get you, the cops will. And, Donny, either way, you're gonna end up dead. Don't you understand that, man? Listen to me! I survived for 10 fucking years without your help. So don't you start fucking worrying about me now! You know... Man, I fucking belong on the street, man. It's what I know. And you know what? You wanna know. I can trust it, man. [CHUCKLING SOFTLY] More than I can trust my own brother.

Fine, you want a last meal before they haul you away? What can I get the Neanderthal? Well, I kinda liked the French toast. Hey. Hey. I came here to apologize, all right? I didn't mean what I said about... About you having a weed up your ass. I was... That was really...Crass. Yeah, crass.You're a disgusting barbarian. Sure, why not.And an insufferable lout. Yeah, well, I'd agree if I knew what the fuck that was. Hey, wait a minute. What is your problem? I'm just trying to be nice to you. Jennifer, that kid bothering you? No, that's all right, Frank.

I came here 'cause I wanted to apologize to you. I wanted... I wanted to tell you that I appreciated what you did for me. All right, but go on. Don't worry about it, okay? Because I'm not gonna bother you no more. Donny! What? If you want to talk, meet me after my dance class tomorrow night, okay? But don't come back here again because it's too dangerous. There's the time and the address. I must be crazy. [SIGHS] MAN: He's hustling pussy at that address Gaines gave you. Some waitress. But he's living with his brother in a room down on Front Street. Well... Then... One for the brother. And one more for the bitch. Our sheep has strayed. Tomorrow night, we bring him back to the fold. All right, let's talk. [SIGHS] JENNIFER: What is it with you, anyway? Why aren't you more like your brother? [SCOFFS] When I was a kid, I used to want to be like Ray. [SCOFFS] But I got over it. [CHUCKLES] What's so funny? Your behavior. I mean, the face you try to so hard to sell, black leather and a bad attitude. Oh, yeah? And what's yours? Uh, fancy music and bullshit dancing? If you came here to attack me again, we can end this conversation right now. Yo, respect cuts two ways. [SIGHS]You may find this hard to believe, Mr. Trueblood, but I've been where you are. And I worked damn hard to get out. And I will not be dragged down again. Not by you, not by anyone. Hey, Jennifer! Hey, Jennifer, wait a minute! I don't want to bring you down. I just want to talk. I even got a poem. A poem? Yeah. Come here, check it out. [CHUCKLES]I, uh... [PHONES RINGING] Lieutenant. You got a lot of balls walking in here. I came to talk to you. [GRUNTING] You're in no position to talk, maggot! I'd just as soon fuck due process and exterminate your sorry ass right here and now. And when you do that you'll never get the guy who killed your partner. I'm looking at the son of a bitch.[GRUNTING] Ah! You know I waited 10 years for this. Ten fucking years, my slimy friend. I did not kill your partner. Oh, you did it all right.[GRUNTING] It was just the two of us on the roof that night, maggot! Nobody else!You're wrong, Lieutenant. There was someone else.Bullshit! Listen, I know who he is. And I know his name, I know where he is and I'll... I'll help you get him. If you're willing to make a deal. Ah!I don't make no deals with cop killers. [WINCES] Just think about it, Lieutenant. Would I be here if I was? All right. You think you got something to say to me? Go ahead, say it. You can have me. You can have me and the guy who killed your partner. But you got to let my brother Donny walk away. What, you out of your mind... If anything happens to him, then you're gonna have a cop killer on the streets. And you're never gonna know his name. Why the fuck should I trust you? 'Cause if you want justice, you got no choice. All right, you got a name? Give me a name. Not without a deal. I'm not playing games with you, shithead! Give me a name! Not without a deal. [EXHALES] All right, kid. You got a deal. But you listen to me, and you better listen good. If you're dicking with me and I find out this is bullshit, I promise you, you and your brother are gonna spend the rest of your life in a cage. I guarantee it. You understand? Now, give me a name. Billy Masters. Masters... Billy Masters? Billy Masters. It was his gun, Lieutenant. He killed your partner. He wanted to kill me. He took off before you got there. [GRUNTING] That's for 10 years. [SIGHS] Better not go any farther. The police have been watching the building. Well, I think it's time we get out of the rain.

Why don't you close your eyes? Got a big surprise for you. Go on. Close 'em! [BILLY CHUCKLING] Turn around. Just like old times, huh, Raymond? Although we never did finish that business, huh? Still think you're better than old Billy, huh? I know what. Why don't we just count to three, and then we find out? [TRAIN CLANKING] One. Two. Three! You're just gonna have to kill me, Raymond.

Come on, here you go. Don't worry about it, kid. I've seen worse. CHARLIE: You have the right to remain silent. If you give up the right to remain silent, anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to speak with an attorney and to have that attorney present during questioning. If you so desire and cannot afford one, an attorney will be appointed... Charlie! Yeah? I'll take care of this. Why don't you go downstairs, call an ambulance? All right, Joe. Turn around, kid. I want you out of town. I don't care how you go. Get a train, get a plane, use your thumb, I don't care. Just make sure you go, you understand? If you don't, I'm coming after you. Now get out of here. Don't worry about him, he'll live. [THUNDER RUMBLING] JOSEPH: Now we're even. [MAN SPEAKING OVER P.A. INDISTINCTLY] Let me tell you something, Trueblood. Just because I dropped the charges, doesn't mean I'm gonna forget you. I can still nail your ass for littering. I understand that, Lieutenant. Don't come back here. Thanks. Now get the fuck out of here. I was beginning to think you'd changed your mind. One-way to Denver with a connection in Wyoming. And after that, you're on your own. Thank you. You tell Frank I owe him. Okay. What did the doctor say? [GRUNTING]Oh, here, let me help you. Well, he said, uh... That I should keep lead out of my diet for a while. God!But he said I'd be all right. How about you? How you doing? I'm tougher than you think. I doubt it. Hey! Always wanted to do that. Bing, bang, boom. As soon as I get, uh... Get settled out there and get an address, I'll send it to you, all right? And you make sure that Donny gets it? What's so funny? I have a little going-away present for you. Did you think you were gonna leave without me, huh? [INAUDIBLE] Take care. CONDUCTOR: All aboard!
