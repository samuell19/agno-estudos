"Kafou: The place where roads intersect. Where the world we know meets the invisible world. Each crossroad requires a sacrifice." Legba Ladies and gentlemen, good evening. Now for our latest news broadcast. First up: according to the National Identification Office, around 400,000 fake ID cards were used in the last elections. A fresh scandal has hit the Haitian parliament. Donald Trump has ordered the US Embassy in Haiti to revoke the visas of Haitian deputies and senators convicted in Haiti or abroad within the past 10 years. On Wednesday morning, the Bank of the Republic of Haiti published a statement to mark the release of a new 2,000 gourde bill. This initiative, supported by the Haitian government, seeks to encourage trade in the informal sector. In international news, Pope Francis is planning a visit to Haiti. The head of the Catholic church has not discussed dates, but, like his predecessor Jean-Paul II, has promised to meet with Haitian Catholics. More on these headlines after the break. Greetings to all those tuning in. You’re listening to "Nou sou kompa", we’re everywhere. We’re with listeners in Jacmel on 85.6 FM and listeners in Petit-Goave on 103.3 FM. We broadcast everywhere, a national network! Next up is Coupé Cloué: Life in New York Is Difficult Even when it’s freezing outside, you have to get up and go to work. Wipe your hands. Life in New York is difficult... And take those off. You don’t like tonm-tonm? Nothing to say? It’s okay. - I’m not so keen on… - What? - I’m not keen on... - Speak up! I’m not keen on gumbo. - I’m careful where I eat. - I see. You don’t trust the sauce. - It’s not that... - It is that, buddy. You’re totally right. You won’t eat it if you don’t know where it’s from. My food is always made by a woman called Maryse. I have no way of knowing if Maryse actually makes it. But she’s got me by the belly so I have to trust her. Trust means peace, gentlemen. You understand? Gentlemen. You meet tonight at 2 am. They give you the key. You pick up the car at Cité Américaine and drive it to your destination. That’s it. Easy. Half now. The rest when the job’s done. - Thanks. - If it goes well, we’ll see about working together. I’m not asking much. There are just 3 rules. Never roll down my car windows. Never open my trunk. Never stop the car for any reason. Not even to piss. Okay? - Okay. - Yes. Good. A shout-out to Richard Cavé! Is there another Carimi in the house? Guys, Carimi has broken up. They had a lot of success in the Haitian music industry. We think a lot of fans are hurting right now. - Boss, sorry. - What? We’re just doing a delivery. I don’t see why we need guns. I don’t think guns make us safer or stronger. You get me? Open your damn mouth! It’s just being intelligent. The statistics are clear. A statistician! More people die with guns than without them. If we have guns, we’re more likely to die. What? So if he gets one, I don’t really need one. It’s logical. Logical? Where’d you find this one? Buddy, how long have you known him? It’s not a question of how long. I see Zoe around. He lives near me. But we’ve been hanging out for 3 days now. 3 days. Zoe, got anyone else? Look, he used to buy my mom’s fried food. Now my mom has diabetes. I told you, I don’t know if you remember. He said he’d help me get a job - to help her out. - "You ignoring me?" That bitch… So… That’s it. We know many Haitians love Coupé. Shoutout to our friend Rutshelle Guillaume, who loves Coupé. So... That’s it? What if… I pay... him... To shoot you? What? Zoe, I’ll give you $15,000. Kill him now. Got you good that time, suckers! You were going to shoot him. He was going to do it. Mafioso. All right, guys. Doc, take the gun. You’re in charge. Boss, how come he gets to be in charge? That was King Coupé, L’Ensemble Select and King Coupé, a title he earned in Africa. Come here, I want a word. Closer, closer. Lean down. No, Chief! When I see you at Nadège’s, we can drink beer and tell jokes. But this is business! - Can’t fool around with thugs! - Okay. Get your shit straight! You. Take the gun. They call us the Black Italians. That’s us, the most handsome men in the city! No other DJs even come close. A shout-out to the beautiful Stéphanie. A beautiful country full of beautiful women! - Is it broken? - Gentlemen. I trust you. KAFOU I wish she’d shut up back there. You can tell just by listening whether it’s a man or a woman? Well done. Hell, man. Does that mean you won’t help? Yo! I can’t drive the whole way like this. So now the noise bothers you? You’ve got serious issues, man. Isn’t there enough noise? Turn it down! Down! It’s to drown her out! - More noise for less? - I don’t know! I’m just driving, I’m not used to this shit. - Why are you stopping? - Shh. Do you see it? What? It’s a dog. Bro, it’s just a dog. What? What’s that? It’s not a dog, man. What’s going on? What’s going on? You want what’s in the trunk? - Is it your master? - Why are you doing this? We’ll go past it. We’ll go past it. - We’ll get past it, I swear. - Bro, calm down! Who are you? I’m from the countryside. Whoever you are, you’re not getting what’s in the trunk! - Let me out! - Fuck off! Zoe, what the fuck!? What an idiot. You’re a total idiot, man. Don’t you think? What if the car broke down? At this time of night. Where’s your brain, brother? You’re a kid. Idiot! Stupid idiot! Fuck! Wait! Fuck! - Yo, deal with her would you? - Shut the window. There’s no AC and I have to shut the window. I asked you to look after the bitch in the trunk! Everything okay, gentlemen? All good, sir. It’s under control. Look at the mincemeat on the hood. This isn’t the best place to wash your car. There’s a car wash down there. Go to Fito’s. I think I’m going to vomit. Are you carrying weapons? Absolutely not, Officer. Negative. Alright. They crashed the Nissan. - Have you been drinking? - No, sir. - Smoking weed? - No, sir. Not even a puff? No, sir, no weed. Gentlemen, you’re blocking the road. You’ve crashed and you didn’t put a warning triangle. - That’s a fine. - That’s why I’m standing here. Are you a pylon? Is he a pylon? You could have used a branch or a tire. "That’s why I’m standing here." I’m fining you. The offence... "In the event of a breakdown, the driver must..." Delta, what’s the name of the fine? - I’ve run out of tickets. - Ask them for cash. I’ve run out of tickets. 2,000 gourdes. - 2,000 gourdes, sir? - Are you paying? I’m just the driver, it’s his car. It’s yours and you’re arguing? I’m broke, sir. These guys are flat broke. Don’t worry, babe. Shall we? I really have nothing. - Get in the back. - Officer! Sierra, he’s full of shit. Sir, I have 2,000 gourdes, but it’s for my mother. Look at this rasta. Your mother’s money? What do I care? That’s not what I said. - That’s bullshit. - Don’t worry, baby. We’re onto them. You believe her, sir? Why would I lie? Look. What are you doing? Sir. On this kind of road, you really need a pick-up. That way, no problems! Get the car off the road. Let’s get the hell out of here! You’re not helping. Are you done? You shat your pants, motherfucker. I know those guys. You know them? They’re always with the Chief. - What? - The money was for my mom! How could I know? If you were anyone else... I’m not used to this shit. Are you for real? I’m all shaken up. Are you for real? Yo, next time, don’t take the risk. Who do you think you are? You have no idea who I am. Yo, did you even bother to check on the bitch? I don’t hear anything. - What if something’s up? - What do you care? You didn’t before. - Don’t you ever hit me again. - Shut up, I’m thinking! Fuck that. Zoe, stop that. Did you open the trunk? I’m talking to you. Are you crazy? Where are you going? Now I’ve seen it all. Who on earth is this guy? Zoe! Hello, boss? - Are you there yet? - No... We’ve got a big problem. Boss, I know the guy in the trunk. You opened the trunk. - Did he see you? - No, I don’t think so. - Okay. - Chief... - What do we do?- What do we do? You do what I told you to do. Boss, he’s my uncle. You can’t make me do this. I’m not making you. I’m paying you, that’s business. - Do you have $20,000? - $20,000? - Brother-in-law, he’s a taxi driver.- Brother-in-law? I’m only screwing your sister. Did she say we were together? Fuck you and your sister! Okay, boss. Just one thing... What the hell? - Boss?- Did you really open the trunk? You’re shitting me. No-one’s tried that for a while. Boss, we had a bit of an accident. I don’t joke with business. Zoe’s a rebel. He wouldn’t listen to me. Do what I told you to do. Whatever your partner tells you, it’s bullshit. If he bothers you, take the car and drop the person off before 5am. I’ll deal with you later on. If that fucker goes near the trunk, you have my permission to shoot him. - Fritz? Chief?- Your mother’s sick? You need money to care for her. That’s all talk. If you make me regret this, I’ll make you pay. - Who did I say was in charge? - Me. - Who’s in charge? - Me. Doc. - Who’s in charge? - Me, boss. Yeah. - What did he say? - Let’s go. - The guy in the trunk… - Please. - What do you mean? - I don’t want to know. - I didn’t say anything! - Exactly. I don’t want to know. Just drive. Did he tell you to shoot me? That’s my uncle in the trunk. You’re lying. Get away from there! - They got us, Uncle! - Shut the trunk! Fuck, I’m going to kill you. You’re going to kill me? No, okay. Get in the car. Get in! You’re going to kill me? Shoot then! While my uncle watches. What the fuck are you doing? That’s my uncle in the trunk. I can’t let him die! - Who said he’ll die? - You think he won’t? You have no idea. Do you have $20,000? You think you know Fritz? He’s got your measure, he doesn’t care about you. He only cares about money. Would you take Mrs Charles? Would you take your mother? If I deliver my uncle, he’s dead. He’s like a father to me. A taxi driver in Miami with a family, where will he get $20,000? I know my family, they won’t pay! They won’t fucking pay, brother! Zoe. Zoe! Why don’t we talk to him? He lives in the US, doesn’t he? He’s from the diaspora, right? He can borrow money. They even get pensions over there. How old is he? He’s old. He’ll get his pension soon. Believe me. He must have savings. Let’s try. Uncle, help! He’s going to kill me! Don’t pull too hard. - Jean-Marie? - It’s okay. - It’s okay, Uncle. Tell your family to send $20,000 or I’ll kill him. - $20,000? - Quickly! I don’t have it. Let the kid go. Grandpa, don’t make me say it again! Give me a number to call or your nephew cops it! I’m going to kill him! Give me a number! - Okay, okay! - He’s going to cop it, grandpa! - I’ll give it to you! - Give me the number! 3...0... - 5... - Wait, wait. It’s international, I don’t have enough credit. Enter "option plus"... Let’s go. 305? - 45... - Wait. Boss? Doc, change of plans. The person in the trunk really is Zoe’s uncle. Is it his first trip back? I’ve never seen him at Nadège’s. No, it’s not her uncle. If you really want to know, they have the same mother, but different fathers. Nadège and Zoe have different fathers? - Fritz, where are you going? - Hmm? What time is it? That’s why I’m asking. I’m in boxers in the kitchen getting something to eat. Are you married, Doc? - No, not really.- Who is it? What do you mean who is it? Are you talking to yourself? who are you calling? - I’m not on the phone.- Liar! Do you want me to come down? I’m hanging up. - Is that your whore on the line? - What do you know about her? What do I know? You going to beat me because of Nadège? You better watch out. The uncle is married to one of Zoe’s aunts. His father’s eldest sister. Aunt Yoyot, the voodoo priestess. Voodoo priestess? Actually, Yoyot is her nickname. Those who know her call her Yvonne. Yvanne. No, Yvonne. - I don’t think I know her. - You do, man. A Black woman who goes there. A Black woman? Anyway, Nadège told me about it earlier on. The aunt and the so-called uncle... Listen up... They’re no longer together. So he’s not really Zoe’s uncle then? That’s right, man. I’ve been negotiating since he landed at the airport with his suitcase at 5pm. The ransom was $20,000. They talked it down to $15,000. Then to $10,000. And finally to $5,000. Then I hear that the person bringing the money never showed up. They called but no-one picked up. They can’t find him. That’s what they said. After that, I said I’d take the money in two instalments. I’ve never done that before. But seeing as it’s his family… The $5,000 isn’t even for me. $5,000 is nothing! That’s just to pay you guys. You get me? They sent me a text saying: "Can we do $1,000?" They can’t pay. And who is this guy? A guy from the diaspora. Just organizing this cost more than $1,000. Did the guy see Zoe’s face? Well, actually... I didn’t see him open the trunk, so... Let’s say he saw him. Let’s not take any risks. It’s unfortunate but these things happen. Understood? We’ll have to transfer the uncle. What do you mean "transfer him"? Where to? What do you want me to say? Are you dumb or what? Boss... I signed on for a delivery, that’s it. Not a transfer. You’re totally right. But you see how things are. There’s a guy I can call. But if he goes down there, I can’t guarantee your safety. He’s unpredictable. You have to sort it out. I’m not spending any more money on this. Finish it. I’ll call you to see how it went. Okay? Doc, 5 am. I trust you. Jean-Marie. I only found out I’d be back yesterday. I couldn’t get a ticket. Bullshit, Uncle. It’s the first time you fly in without sending me a text message. - It’s not much to ask. - Yes. But you have to understand, I thought they’d tell you. You think they tell me things? It’s not my fault. If I picked you up at the airport, you wouldn’t be in this shit. What’s going on? Nothing, just my mother. What’s wrong with her? Uncle, excuse us a minute. Mind your head. Come, I need to talk to you. What’s up? What’s up, brother? Hm? Where are you going? I’m talking and you’re not replying. What’s up, brother? We have a big problem. Which is? I was talking to the Chief. Because your uncle saw your face, we’re in trouble. Given the situation, we have to sort it out. What do you mean, sort it out? I don’t understand. Sort it out how? It’s him or us. No, it’s not possible. Zoe, the Chief won’t change his mind. Oh, fuck. - Okay. - What? Okay. Okay what? We can’t die. Okay. Okay. Jesus broke the coffin... Sure you want to stay here? Life goes on, the show must go on. You’ve been listening to "Jezi kraze sèkèy la", It’s a long song. Now it’s time for us to move on. This is your radio station, and your favourite show: Christ is Calling. Greetings to sister Nanette listening in Fontamara. Greetings to the Durocher family in Delmas 41 and pastor Moise Jean-Charles listening in Lamentin. Before our last prayer, we have something special for you. "Give to be blessed" You want to stop here? There’s a ravine back there. - You sure it’s the best place? - Don’t worry. Won’t there be too many people? We didn’t have a choice, man. Fuck! We don’t have a spade. There’s an old jerry can in the back, you can cut it up. Yo, we didn’t have a choice. Yeah, but... I couldn’t let you carry the burden alone. Where’s the jerry can? I didn’t think it’d turn out like this. If you’d just told me... What’s going on? What’s going on? Hey, come back! Uncle... Uncle! Mom! It’s okay, darling, I’m here. Everything’s fine. Where are you going? The same guy, every night at 2am. Well, I’m ready for him. What’s going on now? The thief came back again. - We never get any sleep around here. - I’ll lose the rent money. - Lose money? Never! - Let’s take action! Let’s get rid of the fucker. Uncle? Uncle! Uncle! Uncle. We’ll sort it out, Uncle. - Uncle! - How did he get out? - Have you seen the thief? - People are coming, Uncle! What the hell, man! You pretend to kill me, you let me go, now you’re trying again! It’s ridiculous. What did I do to you? Why? Jean-Marie, did you come up with this plan? Uncle, I was trying to find a way to save you. Hey, here’s the thief. He’s over here! Hiding behind the trash can. Get him, he’s running away! Uncle! I’m not a thief! Go back inside, grandma! Inside! Now! Hey, there’s the thief, heading for the bridge. Let’s go, let’s go! Where are you, guys? Move it! Let’s go, let’s go! Move it! Zero tolerance! String him up! Let’s go! Motherfucking thief! Take that! Marco, get a move on! You call that running? Let’s go! Let’s go! Let’s go! Come on! Cut him up. Split up, men! Put him in the grinder! Make him into mincemeat! No mercy! Let’s go! There’s no way out. You’re trapped now! What happens in the ghetto, stays in the ghetto! Get him! Come on! Come on, faster! Fuck you! Dirty thief! Motherfucker! Come on, come on! Spread out! Spread out! Some to the left, some to the right. We’ll trap him on the steps. Wake up, men! String him up! String him up! - Machetes for thieves! - Machetes for thieves! - Track him! Get him! - Track him! Get him! - String him up! - String him up! Okay, grandpa, relax. Come with us. Come on, Kernst, come on! No, uncle, no! No, guys, no! If you shoot we’re dead! Do you realize where we are!? Jean-Marie, Jean-Marie! Zoe, look at me, look at me! Not like this! Man, no! - Make room! - Jean-Marie, Jean-Marie! No! No! No, bro! No, Kernst! Kernst! I always pick you up. Why didn’t you call me? Why didn’t you call me? Why didn’t you call? Uncle! Oh, Uncle! Uncle! KAFOU Subtitles: Rhonda Campbell / PARATI FILMS
