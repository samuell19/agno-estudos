What should I ask you? Follow me I've invited the individual you most want to speak with Ca Va Please Were you cold? Rosemary Oh, dear I'm so happy' Ca Va I so wanted to talk to you Your favorite things are, crispy baby fish, yogurt, fresh steamed broccoli All things to eat Clean bath towels, cardboard, water from a faucet Watching tennis on TV Birds chattering before dawn Just as you know me so well, I know you quite well, too You liked eating rice balls Which you can eat with one hand, while drawing manga with the other I always used to think, ''Can't she take time off to eat?'' You know... It always bothered me You were in love with Mr. Kondo at Kadokawa The serious editor I'll never forget the way you danced after you got off the phone when he invited you to dinner I remember now Oh, I'm sorry That's right' he stopped calling you after that It's all right I'm sorry I brought it up It's fine You were very devoted to your work I remember after you handed in the last manga that ran for 2 years you suddenly burst into tears When I first met you, I was still a child But somehow, I grew older than you At the time, I couldn't understand it and I was angry I couldn't live my life at your pace But you never realized that I had grown older than you I'm sorry Humans can be so insensitive My death and the pain caused by your illness, as well as the sadness, will all get older I had a wonderful time Asako Thank you In January, Ms, Asako slowly started to improve Asako Kojima ''The Child Born in August'' I am my own queen and my own people Your daughter is aging Aging? At a terrible speed But you must not give up hope My period stopped Then the panic followed Go, get out here! Just get out of here! I can't control my emotions Yesterday, I was incontinent But you must not give up hope The doctors can't help you! If I were really old, could you date me? I'd have to think about that Last night, she prowled around, crying, 'I want to go home'' What is the ''home'' that she wants to return to? The story ends, just as the girl, the main character, starts to grow again It seemed less a recuperation and more like a baby growing up B O R N That's right, a new me is about to be born It was a beautiful story that no one in the world, other than Ms, Asako could write Good luck Naomi Listen No more fried food or beer Got that? Naomi No more donuts, either Don't drink the soup in the ramen We'll be waiting See you A year's worth of Sato fried meatballs Ms. Asako! Yes? I meant to ask you, what does Gu Gu mean? It means... Every day is good good For no special reason, yesterday's dream was good good A letter from tomorrow I tried whispering Into the passing wind but it scattered on the street Goodgood I wonder who will get it I remember his eyes I'll never forget your words Do you like this town? Do you love it? May Gu Gu live a long life May he be spared illness May he be spared accidents May he enjoy his life And is he lives out his natural life, may I be here to bid him goodbye I'm home' Gu Gu Based on the story by Yumiko Oshima ?GuGu Datte Neko Dearu'' published by KADOKAWA GROUP PUBLISHING CO.,LTD.
