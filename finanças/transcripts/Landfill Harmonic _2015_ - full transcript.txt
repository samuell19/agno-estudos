♪ ♪ ♪ Everyone have fun! ♪ Here we go! ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Hello. Kids! Come here. Learning to play music isn't just holding the instrument and playing. You have to practice certain exercises, and learn to read music. I arrived in Cateura in 2006 to work as an environmental technician. My job was to work with families that collect recyclable materials from the landfill and sell them as their source of income. They are known as gancheros. ♪ My job was to educate them about better ways to collect and sort garbage. ♪ As I began to better understand the situation of families in Cateura, I realized that the future of most kids is to work with garbage just like their parents. ♪ Here in Paraguay, the social conditions often limit the ability to dream. If you're born in the wrong place, you don't have the right to dream. ♪ Count with me. ♪ When I was young, music was the first thing that gave me a sense of purpose. Thus, I decided to teach music to the children of the gancheros. Follow my count. Your mind is wandering. When I started to offer music classes in Cateura, the news that I was offering free music classes spread very quickly. And many kids showed up. More kids than instruments. We did have a few instruments that people had donated. But we didn't have enough instruments for all of the kids that wanted to learn. And I said to myself, "We have to do something to get more instruments." ♪ However, a community like Cateura is not a safe place to have a violin. ♪ In fact, a violin is worth more than a house. ♪ I met Colá when he was working in the landfill as a ganchero. ♪ Colá saw that I was teaching music and one day he approached me. He told me that he had experience working in carpentry. ♪ Favio asked me, " Do you think we can make instruments from garbage?" So I thought about the idea for a while. And then Favio brought me a real violin to see if I could make something similar. I took all the measurements and went to look for a metal can. And I told him, "That's what I'm going to use to make a violin." ♪ It was a continuous process of trial and error. ♪ I asked myself if it was something that could be used to play music or if it would be completely useless. ♪ ♪ ♪ When I played the first violin, it was a moment of enlightenment because we realized that it could function as a real musical instrument. Then we figured we could make other types of instruments. ♪ I could use this to make a drum. ♪ This drum has an X-ray for a drum head. ♪ I can use this to make a cello. This weird-looking cello is made from an oil can, as well as a wooden spoon used for cooking. The tuning pegs are made from wooden spoons, a water spigot, and a size 12 heel from a women's shoe. Two nice pieces of wood from a palette that I can use for a cello, bass, or violin. ♪ No one believed that we could make musical instruments from garbage. ♪ But in the end, we made them all. ♪ ♪ Play using the top end of the bow. ♪ Today is the first day you're playing this song. You're going to make mistakes. But don't let that upset you. Alright? You have to keep trying until you get it. Alright, let's start again. ♪ In the beginning, I felt really frustrated because nothing I played sounded as good as I wanted it to. ♪ Hold on a second. No. In a good orchestra, all of the violins sound the same. That means you have to play the same notes in unison. Your technique is what makes the instruments sound different. That's why your technique is so important. Let's try it again. ♪ One day, my grandmother saw a flyer for guitar and violin lessons. And without asking, she signed me up for classes. ♪ I used to dream of being a singer. I love music, especially rock music. I'm a fan of the Beatles and similar groups. I used to think, " How great would it be to learn to play music." Before, if you wanted to study music, you had to pay for classes in Asunción. ♪ But then I found this opportunity for music lessons with recycled instruments. I never imagined that it would be free. Especially nowadays. ♪ I live with my dad... with my mom... with my sister, and with our pets. ♪ You have to cut all of the knots. Otherwise it's hard to work with. I worked as a ganchero in the landfill for two years from the age of 16 to 18. ♪ In the landfill, I was fortunate to find lots of different cassette tapes. One of the best tapes I found was an album by Phil Collins. His music was a huge part of my life back then. After that, I started to learn about other music that I didn't even know existed. Those groups included Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath. This is one of the most important things that I've taught my daughters. Musicians from all over the world. I have always been interested in the three great composers. Mozart, Sebastian Bach, Ludwig van Beethoven. Jimmy Hendrix. Sex Pistols. Who has never heard of them? All my life I tried to be part of a band, or have an instrument to play. But I never had that opportunity. Bye, mom. ♪ My closest friends are the violinists. Which are María... ♪ Natalia... ♪ And Tania. ♪ My most precious possession is my violin. ♪ I treat it like a jewel. ♪ I have other beautiful things like bracelets, rings, and necklaces. But I'm starting to pay less attention to those things. Now I'm focusing more on my violin. ♪ Hey guys. How are you? Go on inside. - Hey, how are you Jorge? - Spectacular. Can I have your attention for a moment? Someone heard about our orchestra and has invited us to play at an event. That means we have only a few days until our first performance. The piece of music that we will be playing is "Ode to Joy." Because it's the piece of music they want to hear that night. And the main part of the song will be played by the first violins. ♪ Try it again. ♪ Much better. Everyone in the group is unique. Some of us learn the music faster than others. Some of you are very focused, but others have trouble paying attention. Those are the dynamics of a group. Ok? So we have to help those who have trouble focusing and learning. Understand? You must stay focused. One ice cream cone each. Just one. Hold on to that. There you go. Why did you fool me? The melancholy is going to kill me. And now, without you, my life is over... All done? Nice work, María. - Do you like how it looks? - No. ♪ Who put the strings on this violin? ♪ The strings are on backwards. ♪ Our instruments are out of tune. We need to tune them again. ♪ Are you sure you have the correct piece of sheet music? Then what's wrong? One, two, three and... No. One more time. Last time through. ♪ Let's give a round of applause for director Favio Chávez and the Recycled Orchestra from Cateura. For your enjoyment. ♪ ♪ Just to be on stage at this point is an accomplishment for us. ♪ How well we play is secondary. ♪ The challenge we were faced with is how to convert our small orchestra of recycled instruments into an actual symphonic orchestra. ♪ We started to think that we could play music for real. ♪ About 25 years ago, this creek was clean with white sand. We used to call it Arroyo Moroti in the Guaraní language. That means "white creek." We used to wash clothes here. And kids would bathe in the water. It's a shame. When my family moved here, there was just this creek. There were no gardens. There was nothing. We couldn't plant anything because when it rained, everything would flood. We have to plant along the creek to prevent erosion of the soil. If you don't build up the riverbank, your house could flood. When it rains hard, the water can reach this high. But thank God it doesn't flood here anymore. ♪ I'm convinced that the environment and the deterioration of our surroundings determines our quality of life. And I always wanted to do something about that. ♪ I thought I had the answer to the problem of dealing with garbage. But reality taught me otherwise. ♪ The recycling project that brought me to Cateura in the first place failed. ♪ It failed because you have to change the entire system beginning at the source. ♪ But my failure, as if by magic, caused me to persist with the idea of the orchestra. ♪ ♪ ♪ Ok. Stop. No, no. ♪ Ok. Make the notes rounder. As a group, we have our first international presentation in 10 days. ♪ We have received an invitation to perform at the Rio +20 World Summit, an international conference related to environmental policy. We still have a lot of work to do. Not just musical improvement but also emotional preparation. I don't want to call anyone out personally. But preparing for an important event is not only about learning the music. You also need to prepare yourselves personally. We must develop proactive attitudes. Proactive attitudes are the ones that help accomplish our goals. So, we need to focus on the actions that help us achieve positive results. You all are not like the kids on the streets, or like any other kid. Preparing for this trip is not just about the music. It's much more than that. You got it? Help each other out. We're a team. Our strength is in our unity. ♪ Play louder. The violinists have the hardest job out of the entire group. They need to have a different attitude than the others in the group. When they doubt their abilities, the instrument doesn't sound good. ♪ They may not feel confident about the music they're playing, but they still need to feel confident about themselves. Why aren't you playing? I am playing. No you're not. You're not playing. Let's play through it one more time. ♪ Oh, no. Don't be scared to play. ♪ Play without fear. Don't be afraid to play. ♪ Tania doesn't really have a father. He is absent from her home. ♪ He abandoned the family. So she's living with her mother now. ♪ Her mom works all day, so Tania has to take care of her younger siblings. ♪ She's like the second mother of the family. ♪ We had a small family problem, and things weren't so good. Now I'm living in my aunt's house. A little distant, but that's all. I don't see anything wrong with that. As a mother, I can tell you that supporting all of my kids is very difficult. I'm not always able to be there for them. But at least I try to give them advice about how to take care of themselves. I used to see Tania walk by my house, but I didn't know who she was. Are you going to take your instrument? No, it's at the school. Oh, you have it there. You look so pretty. ♪ I met Tania the day I started violin classes. ♪ I was impressed by how she played. ♪ She inspired me to play the violin. I initially wanted to play the guitar. But when I saw Tania play the violin, I also wanted to play it. ♪ We could try to practice Monday, Wednesday and Saturday. Tania is emotionally closed off. We can practice at María's house. When we ask her about her life, she won't tell us anything. ♪ My best friend is María because she's a good person. And she is able to keep secrets. ♪ If Tania is around a lot of new people, she can be very shy. But once she gets to know you, she will be your friend. She's your ally. She's always looking out for you. She's a great friend. How many girls do we have? Four? No. There are six. Remember, these shirts are for the concert. What do you think of this color? Opinions? Alright. We're done here. Thank you. Let's go. ♪ This is the first time that I will fly in an airplane. It will be my first time in a hotel. And it will also be my first time seeing the ocean. But the most exciting part is to see a new country, and be with my friends. I think all of the clothes I own will fit in here. Let me know if you like these. Speak now or forever hold your peace. You can't give them to me each for 450 guaraní? No discount at all? - 480 each, right? - Yes. Alright, let's go. Thank you sir. See you later. ♪ One time María was practicing violin and left her bow in the bed. And when I went to bed I broke it. What is the gesture that Estéban always uses? Something like this... Favio understands your unique language and gestures, right? I think he's almost ready to publish a new dictionary... Spanish - Estéban, Estéban - Spanish. Favio will ask him, " Is your drum kit ready yet?" He responds, "Yes, I just need to..." What he is trying to say is " I need to turn my kick drum around." I have a hearing problem. When I was eight years old I had the mumps. It's a disease that affected my throat here, as well as my inner ear. He has always been very hyperactive. He would play rhythms on anything he could find. It's something that makes me feel free. It's my personality. Playing the drums liberates me. ♪ We took him to a doctor and he said he could no longer play drums. He became very depressed by this diagnosis. Very depressed. He didn't want to do anything. It was like they had stabbed me with a sword right in the heart. They told me that I needed to use a hearing aid. But I decided to keep playing the drums. I don't want my problem to hold me back. ♪ This is our last rehearsal before our trip to Brazil. We're making sure all the instruments are working correctly. There is still a lot of work to do. Before a big event, I always have trouble sleeping. Or I have nightmares that I forget to do something. Or that there's some kind of major problem. I never have enough time to anticipate all of the challenges that will arise. I need to double-check all of the children's documents to make sure they are all good to travel. All of the violins - play an "A." ♪ Alright. Let's try it this time but with effort. ♪ First of all, you all are fighting with the notes. ♪ Each note should sound crisp. But your notes sound muddy. You're tripping over the notes. We have been invited to perform, and there are high expectations of us. I know we're not big stars like other groups. But we still have to give it our best shot. This screw is totally stripped. To be a musician in the Recycled Orchestra, you not only have to learn to play music with these particular instruments, but you also need to solve the problems that the instruments always have. Thus, each member of the orchestra is both a musician and a luthier. I'm going to remove the dents from this instrument. It needs to be more round, as close to a circle as possible. Give it a try with the car jack. Give it two more turns. Alright, that's good. No, I don't want any right now. Without music, my life would be meaningless. ♪ Here in Paraguay, there is a very important document that children need in order to travel.

There are going to be a lot of people here. Be sure to smile. The only moments when you need to be serious are when we finish a song and we're about to begin the next one. Because we don't know what's going to happen. I still don't know the order of the songs we're going to play. But this is a great opportunity to show off the orchestra and represent Paraguay.

Look at this! - I mean... - That's a fork, people. Get this, a group of kids in Paraguay actually made all of the instruments out of things that they found in the trash.

I posted it on my Facebook page and shared it on David Ellefson's page. ♪ He responded to us, and we began emailing back and forth. ♪ When I heard the story about the kids in Cateura, what really hit me was the human spirit is the same and connected all around the world. Music is a language that transcends all languages. When people are attracted to something, because it's very organic and it really touches their heart or it speaks to their spirits... And it's certainly how I feel about going down to Paraguay... Something that, for me, it speaks to my heart and it feels like it's a calling. So, this is it. All right.

Colá almost died working there. ♪ He was in the hospital for one month and 22 days. He got sick from working in the landfill. ♪ But now he doesn't work in the landfill as a ganchero anymore.
