(birds chirping) (footsteps clacking) (door creaks) (curtain rod rattles) Gran. (somber music) Take care, Granny. I'll miss you. (somber music) (creature screeches) (suspenseful music) (creature screeches) (ominous music) Granny! Gran! (creature screeches) Shh! Shh! What's the matter, hmm? It's all right. (object thumps) Shh. (creature screeches) (footsteps clack) (creature screeching) (ominous music) (creature screeches) (dramatic music) (solemn music) Through the long grass, creep, creep, creeping, came the Hobyahs. Skip, skip, skipping on the end of their toes, ran the Hobyahs. And the Hobyahs cried, "Pull down the hempstalks, eat up the little old man, carry off the little old woman". Then little dog Turpie ran out, barking loudly. The Hobyahs were afraid and ran home as fast as they could go. But the little old man awoke and cried, "Little dog Turpie barked so loud that I cannot slumber nor sleep. In the morning, I will take off his tail. So the little old man took off little dog Turpie's tail, to stop him from barking. That night, (ominous music) along came the Hobyahs. Out from the deep woods, run, run, running, came the Hobyahs. Through the long grass, creep, creeped, creeping, came the Hobyahs. Skip, skip, skipping on the ends of their toes, came the Hobyahs. (Turpie barking) The little old man awoke and cried, "Little dog Turpie barked so loud that I cannot slumber nor sleep. In the morning, I will take off his head. So the little old man took off Turpie's head to stop him from barking. Then little dog Turpie could not bark anymore. (animals howling) (ominous music) The third night, along came the Hobyahs. (Hobyahs screeching) They took the little old woman away in their bag. They would hang the bag on a big hook and poke it with their long fingers. The little old man realized he had been very wrong. So he took Turpie's tail and his legs and his head and he gave them back to him again. Then Turpie went sniffing and snuffing along to find the little old woman. Whoa! Can't we hear the rest, please, Miss? You all know how it ends. You've heard it enough times. Look, we have something else to do now. Let's all wish Celia a happy birthday. She'll be nine on Sunday. (hands clapping) One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, and one to make you grow! All right, now, quiet, please, everyone, while we say the final prayer. We thank you Lord for all the good things you have brought us, this year. We ask you to guide us over the long summer holidays and pray that everyone- Ow! Has a safe and happy Christmas. (children chattering) (children yelling playfully) Thank you. All right, you can go now. And don't do it again. That's already promised to Heather. You can choose another book. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. You know Dad's always late. Behave yourself. What? Oh. Um, just to the front doors out and- (furniture rattling) You gonna help or what? Hello. (children laughing) (boy hooting) A monkey! (boy hooting) All right, that's it. Aw, not yet! Aw, no, please! One more, please. Just, just one, Mama. Please! All right, one more. Yay! Woo! (Celia hooting) Barn owl. Hello. Hello. Come on. Who is she? I don't know. Celia! I'm sorry. Is she making a nuisance of herself? No, not at all, she's welcome anytime. It's a relief to see her playing with other kids, for a change. You can join in, too. (girl yells) Don't read that now. All ready for the big day? Ow! Ow, don't! That's enough, you two. You sorry now you didn't want a birthday party? It wouldn't be the same without Granny. We got you something really special, this year. Is it the one with the black ear? What? My rabbit. You know you're not getting a rabbit. You're getting a surprise. But Granny promised. She never told us that. Rabbits are vermin, like snakes and rats. Pet white ones aren't. Straight to sleep. Come on, sleepyhead! (birds chirping) It's a Malvern Star. (birds chirping) The Australian Peace Council, recognize it? Many of you will have found it in your letterbox, during the week. But do not be deceived. We all want peace. Jesus Christ died for peace and for everlasting life. But the Australian Peace Council is a communist front. It has nothing, nothing to do with peace. Let us pray. Almighty and everliving God- Liar. We pray that you will lead the nations of the world in the ways of righteousness and peace. (door creaks) (dog barking) (bicycle rattling) (solemn music) (bright music) Granny, Granny, Granny, Granny! (woman laughing) (bright music) (both laughing) You know, my father built that house himself. And your place was just a field. This was before your time, I gather. Used to go sparrowing there. Don't do that, Celia, just leave it. But it's falling off. You're being rude to your friends, go and play. You're right. It is. Every Sunday, without fail. Would you like another one? There are orchards right behind. Thanks. Must be strange staying in one place all your life. I hope you offer everyone else a drink, too, Celia. (people laughing) Never! (Heather screams) Take it home! (boys laugh) I've spent more time with John's family than my own. He'll be here soon. You'll like him. This must be my lucky day. Ray, Evan's at the Box Hill depot, too. What, at the PMG? I've been trying to place you. I'm an admin, and you're, uh- I'm down in the engineering department. Oh, no wonder I didn't recognize you. You blokes never come up for air. They don't know what hard work is, do they? (laughs) Come meet the girls. And where were you living before, Evan? Just the other side of town. Hmm. Are you gonna drink that all by yourself, Celia? Better late than never, eh? John! I brought Brer Rabbit to play with yours. Where is it anyway? I've been telling Mrs. Tanner all about you. Didn't you get one? Your dad says you shouldn't, 'cause rabbits are pests. (guests chattering) (man laughs) (solemn music) (Celia sniffs) (Celia sighs) (chimes jingling) (window rattles) You know you're not allowed in here. Get out. Look at your eyes! (men laughing) I don't blame her. We should clear that room out. It's unhealthy. Bang! (Steve groans) Bang! (Heather groans) (birds chirping) Bang, bang! (Karl groans) (solemn music) Stick 'em up! (mimics gunfire) (Celia groans) (boys yelling) Quick. (bright music) You can have the quarry! Like hell! It's better in here, except for the smell. Just ignore him. It's got secret powers. Wow. Don't worry about Karl. He's just a bookworm. Ooh! Stephanie, give it back! Ah! (Stephanie laughing) (bright music) (ominous music) (leaves rustling) (Stephanie laughing) (creature hissing) (ominous music) It's got Granny's mask. I swear on my living heart. Blood will never part. I swear on my living heart. Blood will never part. Ouch! Shh. (all laugh) I swear on my living heart. (Meryl laughing) (gentle music) Plague has arrived. Once lush pastures are overrun by the dreaded rabbit menace. Too bad for you, boys, there's no way out, this time, thank goodness. All over the country, farmers are doing everything they can and killing rabbits in their thousands. (dramatic music) But still, the furry pests advance. Mosquitoes, usually our enemy, are temporarily our friends, as they spread the myxomatosis virus. Here, the sure signs of a successful infestation, another step in the battle to save our precious land. Dad. It's anchors aweigh for the polar ship Nella Dan, as she heads for Antarctica, 11,000 miles from home. It's beautiful. This starting voyage- Dad. It's all right. Why was the rabbit blind? It's myxo. That rabbit's vermin. (dramatic music) You saw them? I thought they were at the back, but I think they've moved. (dramatic music) Where are you going? Just to the front. Stay here. (suspenseful music) (gun firing) (body thumps) (suspenseful music) What kept you? Hand over the marbles. Excuse me. I've been waiting for these for a long time. Boo! They weren't there. Why, you dirty, double-crossing- Shh! Lowdown cheat. Put it away, Laura. You ain't got the nerve. You think I've lost my touch? The deal's off, babe. (gun fires) (dramatic music) This is Mike Mayfield here. We're on our way. Over. (dramatic music) (siren wailing) (Celia gasps) (kick thuds) (usher grunts) (suspenseful music) (kids laughing) You was lucky, lady. You nearly lost your marbles. But Mr. Mayfield, how can I repay you? (all laughing) We caught the criminal. That's our reward. Bringing him to justice! (all cheer) I hope you gave Stephanie a black eye, too, Cel. Her mum will kill you. Cocky bastards. (kids laughing) (kids cheering) (crickets chirping) We might see Sputnik. The commie spy. Do you know the workers went through all the trouble of building a satellite just to watch the capitalists? The Soviets got nothing to learn from them. What's it do then? It plays "Jingle Bells" for Father Christmas. He's a Red. Alice? Quick, hide, the spies. Found that recipe for you. Uh-oh. Celia, see you in five minutes. Yes, Mum. Never been much good, but I'll give it a go. I can help. You don't know what you're letting yourself in for. Last time I cooked a cake, I forgot the eggs. (Pat laughs) She's not joking. Ray's out drinking again. But weren't you going to Debbie's tonight? Same old story. Come on, Celia. How about Celia stay the night here? Then you don't have to wait for Ray. It's no problem. Meryl's got a spare bed. All right then, good night. Good night, Mum! Good night, Mrs. Carmichael. Good night! Good night. You were lucky. We weren't allowed to show the place, so we did it in the back of the truck. Granny took that. This was a campaign against war. I want to find one of her. He's dead. See? She does look like you. She's far more beautiful. What's black and greasy and shakes like a spazo? Give up? Elvis Presley. (both laugh) (Steve groans) (Alice and Evan moaning) What is that? Mum and Dad, you dummy. (Alice gasping) Is Alice all right? (boys laugh) (thunder rumbling) You had the chore of followin' her anyway. You don't say that to me! Your father's angry. What are you talking about? Will you just listen? I'll bet you two bob Mom storms out. The facts are that it is the difference between losing the coal strike and winning the waterside. You know she won't. If we don't keep a united front, we might as well just pack up and go home. Two bob then, go on? I don't agree. We're better off without the buggers. Can I ask why everyone is avoiding the issue. We haven't even talked about Stalinism. The key issues are economic. You know why people have left. And what do you do at the APC, just sit around grateful of us? No, we talk about peace, something the Labor camp's forgotten about. Australian Peace Council is a good women's auxiliary. (men laugh) Well, that's really gonna help a united front. I don't go around slamming you, Evan. No, just the Soviets. You're a fool. Let's just have some big... Alice! Pay up. Let's just live on to the next item, Jack. Yeah, right, uh, we've got a problem with running-up machine. Is anyone gonna volunteer to help? Got it! Hey! Do you want to help with the dishes, precious? Number-one daughter's still here again? (Ray hums) I always feel like singing when I'm wet. You don't sing, Dad. What have you done to her? She never does the dishes at home. Alice tortured me. (Ray chuckles) Mrs. Tanner, Celia. It's all right. I prefer Alice. A wonderful name. All right. Off to your space, Celia. Let me help. Will you both stop bickering? Well, you go in there and apologize. I'm sorry. I hadn't realized. You got stuff all over you. (laughs) And I don't want you getting into any more fights. Is that understood? Don't get smart. Yes, Dad. That's not the way you fold them. You got any sauce, Patty? Where did you get this? Alice. What have they been telling you? What have they said? You can come and help. What are we doing? What's going on here? Spring cleaning. No! Their Granny's! No! (fire roars) (Celia grunting) (somber music) (Celia sobbing) (knocks at door) You can borrow our books anytime, Cel. (somber music) (knuckles thump) I'll just get Celia. It was you I wanted to see. Do you think we fought the war for people like you to be so stupid? Put us all in gray uniforms and feed us from the one big pot, is that what you want? I wouldn't say that equality and a fair go for people meant that, no. Alice, you're too smart to be mixed up with a bunch of ratbags. They'll drive you from your family, Steve, Meryl. You have no idea what they can do. What about me? Shh! You're speaking with great authority. Did Evan lead you into this? I'll get Celia, Ray. Don't, Ray! What are you doing? Why are you doing this? Sorry. (knuckles thump) Mum! Hello, Mr. Carmichael. Steve. (animals grunting) Thank you. We'll just be a sec. Okay, you can have her on one condition. You're not to play with the Tanners anymore. They're communists. Bad people. Hmm? That's the deal. The Tanners are my friends. You're a lucky rabbit. I didn't think we'd ever get rid of you. Didn't get her gift wrapped. Is that all right? Murgatroyd. Who? Murgatroyd. Murgatroyd? How about Patch or Binkle? Murgatroyd. You're not to see the Tanners. I forbid it. Look, don't do that, you'll get germs. Come on. Mirror, mirror on the wall, who's the prettiest of them all? Come here. Come on. Can I have a word with you, mate? Yeah, sure. Wait here. Who's this? Murgatroyd. Let me hold him! Do you like Stephanie's confirmation dress, Celia? I don't think white's her color, Auntie Deb. Perhaps yellow, to match your teeth. (laughs) About time! Who's that? Murgatroyd. Come on, Mike Mayfield will be over. I can't go. I'm not allowed to play with you anymore. Why not? 'Cause Dad gave me a rabbit. She's beautiful. Start again, Cel. What do you mean? Hold her. Thank you. He didn't like the leaflet. Why did you show it to him? (rock bangs) What the hell was that? Steve, language! (rock clacks) Ouch! No, she'll trap us! Follow me. Wait! Not here! Where do we go? I don't know. Dirty Reds! Spy bastards! Russian spies! Dirty Reds! Dirty Reds, Dirty Reds, Dirty Reds, Dirty Reds, Dirty Reds, Dirty Reds, Dirty Reds, Dirty Reds, Dirty Reds, Dirty Reds, Dirty Reds, Dirty Reds, Dirty Reds. (Heather yells) (kids grunting) Celia, traps! (Celia yells) (Stephanie laughs) (Celia yells) Ow! (kids yelling) (Stephanie yells) Steve! (Celia yells) (kids grunting) Come on, break it up, break it up! Come on! Stephanie, Celia! Come here, on the double! Oh, Dad, she's hurting. Quick, march! Hey, back here! Anyone like to tell me what's going on? Stephanie! Soapy? Report to your mother, straightaway, and you stay in your rooms till I get home! I'll be seeing your parents. And don't let me ever catch you over here again, the same goes for you lot. Yes, sir. Sorry, Sergeant Burke. Heather. Off you go. What do you think your father is gonna say? Off you go. Yes, sir. Get moving, Celia. I'm waiting for the others. All right, you can come along with us. Where are we going? Quick! Well, you can't do this. We didn't start the fight. Bush lawyers. They teach 'em young. (strap slapping) (boys grunting) Right, now get out. Okay. Alice! (hand slaps) You're not allowed to throw stones! It's not our fault, Mum. We didn't start the fight. Out to the car, go on. And I think you better stay here. This won't happen again. I should hope not. They started a pretty serious fight. Someone could've been badly hurt. Meryl tells me they didn't start it. Was she there? Why didn't she own up like the rest of them? Just a minute. Did you start the fight? It's all right. Did you? This isn't gonna get us very far. Be quiet. If you and Steve and Karl didn't start it, who did? Stephanie. Where's your daughter, Sergeant? She'll be dealt with. Look, I don't wanna make a big issue out of this. It's just we've never had fights like that around here. It's a matter of discipline. Your beliefs are your own, but when it comes to allowing your children to... (door thuds) If you have something against my family, you say it to me. Don't you ever victimize my children again or I'll make damn sure you're reported. Come on, Celia. Hey, you can't take her. Tell Patty I've got her. (door thuds) You know how important it is to keep your word. I never said I wouldn't play with them. You took the rabbit. Does that mean you're gonna give her back? The Tanners aren't hurting anyone. (lighter clicks) Now that you're at the ripe old age of nine, let me tell you something. You learned a lot from Granny, but if it had been up to her, what do you think Uncle John and I would've done, during the war? Let the Japs bayonet us and dig bamboo under our nails and said thank you, Honorable Sirs, we love you, while they bombed Australia? I thought you had more sense than to be duped by people like the Tanners. I hate him. You're grounded for a week. And the rabbit's out of bounds till I say. Put it away. (creature screeching) (switches clicking) (window rattling) (ominous music) Granny! Gran! Granny! (yells) (birds chirping) (somber music) Go on. (grunts) (head thumps) Ow! Go, go on, go on. Come on, that's it, go on. John wanted to drag you over the coals, but I stopped him. We don't need your protection, though, if that's what you call it. You will need my protection. The PMG doesn't like Red Raggers. They're a security risk. Stay there. Ow! Are the children security risks, too? You let Celia play with mine. Where did you get these? I found them when I was planting bombs. (door thuds) (leaves rustling) You all right? (laughs) Come on. Okay. (Ray laughs) Do you trust me? When I was your age, I went through hell. And I know it might not make much sense to you now, but you must never play with the Tanners. (Ray sighs) (natives chanting in foreign language) Ah, it won't budge. Jeff, you were down here. Don't you remember how you got in? I can't remember. Think hard, Jeff. We've got to get in there. Now let me think. (natives chanting in foreign language) (water babbling) (Celia groans) Green bush. You're allowed to come with us to the beach. What's that smell? Yeah. Who asked you to come over? Why not? Why do you think? Don't you know? Of course she knows. Dad got the sack. It's all your father's fault. It's all her fault. She's the one who gave him the leaflet. Traitor! Mum, they said Dad made Mr. Tanner lose his job. Who's they? The Tanners. Where did you see the Tanners? I wasn't playing with them. But they said- Your father would never do that. Mr. Tanner would've resigned of his own free will. Celia? Mum said he resigned. He didn't resign. Uncle John, Dad told him. I bet it's his fault. Maybe. (solemn music) Swear on my living heart. Blood will never part. (sand clatters) (solemn music) (gentle music) (mysterious music) (creature screeching) (match crackles) (creatures groans) (creature growling) (creature yells) (solemn music) (fire crackling) Hobyahs out! Murgatroyd in Stephanie's head! John Burke is dead! Hobyahs out! What are Hobyahs? Shh! Cel thinks they run around after dark. You don't believe in the Bogeyman still? Shh! (Karl laughs) Hobyahs out! Murgatroyd in Stephanie's head! John Burke is dead! (Celia screaming) (sticks clacking) Take them, take them, take them, take them, take them, take them, take them, take them, take them, take them, take them, take them, take them, take them, take them, take them, take them, take them, take them, take them, take them, take them, take them, take them, take them, take them, take them, take them, take them, take them, take them, take them, take them, take them, take them, take them, take them, take them, take them, take them, take them, take them, take them, take them, take them, take them, take them, take them, take them. (Celia screams) (dog barking) (Stephanie screams) Dad! Dad! (dog barking) You recognize these? Do you? They're dolls. I know they're bloody dolls. Where did they come from? Don't avoid the question. This is no laughing matter. Stephanie nearly died of fright, last night. I want the truth Celia. Look at me! Did you or didn't you throw those dolls? Get up. (belt slapping) When did this happen? Look at those. But you wanted to talk about this sensibly. We're way past that. Give me the belt, Ray. Hand me the belt. I don't care what the reason is. You don't whip her. Yes, yes, and here you are, and our daughter's running around with a bunch of ratbags making voodoo dolls and God knows what else, and you can't bear to see her punished. I'll tell you one thing, this doesn't happen in John's family, and for one bloody good reason. As soon as they step out of line, they get a hard whipping, and that's that. (door thuds) You're staying at home till school starts. (box thuds) (Celia sniffs) Mum. Hmm? Is Alice a bad person? No. But if she's a communist? Well, some people can be innocent. They just get talked into things. Communists are very bad, dangerous, brainwashed people. But if they do that- You'll understand one day, when you're older. (dramatic music) The skies darken over Victoria as rabbits continue to multiply in their thousands. Time is running out for our man on the land. The premier, Mr. Henry Bolte, has stepped in and promised that his government will halt the deadly rabbit march. By the end of the year, he wants no rabbits at all, in Victoria. The spreading of myxomatosis has been stepped up, and the government is considering banning the keeping of pet rabbits. And here, Australia has even been breeding pet rabbits to eat. This has been a matter of concern for some time. And my government feels that action must be taken. Rabbits are a serious menace to Australia's economy, and we'll be doing everything we can. (fanfare music) Mum. Celia, darling, they're only thinking about it. But will they? I don't think so. Let's get an ice cream. Alice! Hello, Celia. Alice, will they ban pet rabbits? Oh, I don't think the government would dare do anything as serious as banning pet rabbits. They'd lose too many votes. You run along now, Celia. You're not allowed to speak to people like me. Murgatroyd will be all right. Uncle John found the dolls. (Tanner kids laugh) I think this whole thing's ridiculous. I've been feeling lousy. I'm so sorry to hear about Evan. How are you? Couldn't have happened at a worse time. I'm not even a member of the party anymore. Evan was thinking of leaving. So when the PMG started giving him a hard time... He's got no fight left. The party meant everything. Does that mean you're not a communist? Oh. (laughs) I agree with the principles. The PMG told Dad to leave the party or he'd get the sack. Of course they didn't. It was almost that blunt. How much did Ray have to do with this? Don't you know? I never thought he would. See? There might be a few things you wouldn't think of. I'm sick of it, Pat. Every time we get settled, something goes wrong. Hey, how 'bout a game of animals? Animals. I would like to propose a toast, to our wonderful government. (glasses clink) Straight you their ass. (Pat laughs) Mum's drunk. You know why? We're moving to Sydney. I heard them talking, last night. You sure? Dad can't find a job. Nobody wants electrical engineers anymore, except the government, and they won't employ him. We're moving before school starts. (fire roaring) Death. Get my hammer and scissors. Take him, take him, take him. Death to Ray Carmichael. Take him, take him, take him, take him, take him, take him! Death, death, death! Death, death, death, death, death, death, death, death, death, death, death! Hey, come here. It's all boarded up. (fire crackling) Hobyahs! (kids screaming) Murgatroyd! Hey, Cel, just giving Mur the hot cross burn so the rabbit inspectors will know which one to take. (boy laughs) (hammer thudding) No! Stand still. I can't. Oh God. (Heather crying) (flesh sizzles) (Murgatroyd whimpers) (hammer thudding) Ow! (Celia yelling) Come on, get 'em! Spazo! You're a spazo! (kids yelling) (Celia sobbing) It's all right. It's all right. (lips smack) (Celia sobbing) Is she all right? We got away. Can I see? You're gonna lose your rabbit! We'll get them. You're gonna lose your rabbit! Shut up! I'm telling you! You're gonna lose your rabbit! Shut up! You're gonna lose your rabbit! You're gonna lose your rabbit. I'll get you! All right, in to your mother, dinner's ready. Where have you been? You were meant to be home an hour ago. (Celia sobbing) What's wrong, eh? (Celia sobbing) Come inside. I'm gonna put something on it. (bell ringing) Dad's gonna have to work with Grandpa in his shop. It's not fair. He'll hate it. Here they come. Hey, wait for us! Get ready. (Karl whistles) I like your mosquito net. Morning. Dad! Dad! Crikey! Angel. Stephie. What? What ever... We got her! We got her! (dog barking) Steve, Karl, Meryl, I thought I heard you, hurry up. Mum. Why don't you throw them all away? You're doing well, come on. That's today's, haven't read it yet. You'll be all right. Bags the window seat! No, it's mine! Mum! Meryl, you can sit in the front. Swear on my living heart. Blood will never part. All aboard, everyone, or we'll miss the train. Bye, Alice. Stand firm. Bye, Cel. You can do it. Bye, Cel. Bye. Bye, Cel. Bye. If Mr. Carmichael hadn't tried to kiss Mum all the time, we could've stayed. Yeah. Good luck. Goodbye, Ray. Goodbye. Look out for Hobyahs! (engine revs) (gentle music) Patty. Patty, I need to talk. If you're gonna tell me it's not what I think, don't bother. I know what I think. I don't want to say anything more about it. Don't. I'll be all right in the morning. Good night. (ominous music) (creatures screeching) (birds chirping) You never know, we might see some ducks. Here's your towels. If we don't see any ducks, he might shoot you. Sure you won't come? It could wait. No. (suspenseful music) I don't know what you see in that book? Creep, creep, creeping on the tips of their toes came the Hobyahs. That's horrible. I thought you liked fishing. It's all right. Thank you. Hey! Oh, you might have something. (reel clicking) (rod clatters) Don't care was made to care. Don't care was made. Don't care was put in a pot and boiled till he was done. (Celia yells) (solemn music) Oh, thank goodness you're home, John's here. Try and see my position for one minute. Stephanie's howling blue murder till Celia takes her rabbit to the zoo. That's your problem, John. What am I supposed to tell Stephanie, that the government makes laws for her but not for Celia? You know how much that rabbit means to her. I didn't make the laws, Patty. I'm sorry, mate. We've made our decision. Mum! We're not sure Celia could cope. Jesus, this is an about-face, isn't it? I mean, you were always the one dead against rabbits. The law's only supporting your own bloody views. There'll be a song and dance till that rabbit's in with the rest of 'em. I'm sorry. I have to do it, mate. No! (object rattling) (ominous music) (creature screeching) Murgatroyd! Mum! It's the Hobyahs! It's the Hobyahs. They've got Murgatroyd! Mum, they've got her! They've stolen her, Mum! Celia! No! Shush up. Now listen, look, she's gotta go. You're not allowed to keep her anymore. Give her back, John. You hardly have the right to come sneaking around here at night. Come back here! All right, fine us. That's not the point, Patty. Celia, go inside. You give me that bloody rabbit! John. I mean it, Patty. This is my job. You're throwing it in my face. I don't care. You're not getting her rabbit. (both whispering) I can keep her, can't I? Come to bed now, darling. Can I keep her? (car door thuds) Yes. (engine revs) (bright music) Good morning, class. Good morning, Mrs. Casey. (bright music) (bell rings) Everyone who lost their rabbits come with me. Aren't you coming? (bright music) (dramatic music) Mum! Mum! She had to go. I know. (coughs) I'm sorry, Celia. Hey, I thought you might like to look after this little fella for a while. (dramatic music) I hate you! (Celia grunts) (kids yelling playfully) I want whoever did this to own up. Mr. Bolte is our leader. And this sort of defacement will not be tolerated. Celia Carmichael. And I thought you were one (students laughing) of the brighter girls in the class. If Mr. Bolte doesn't know the difference between pet rabbits and wild ones, he should get the sack. (students gasp) Outside. Come on. (students laughing) All right, class. And we'll write to the government and apply for a permit to keep Murgatroyd. According to the law, they can't say no. When can I see her? Soon. I thought I heard you. A group of us are going to see Mr. McElroy. He's the Superintendent of Vermin and Noxious Weeds. You won't be going anywhere. They're a bunch of troublemakers that'll take up any cause to undermine the government. Our leader's a reverend, for goodness sakes. You're being duped. Not anymore. How's my soldier? Hmm? Tell me one new thing you learned at school today. Mrs. Casey said I should be a lawyer when I grow up. A lawyer? I'd rather breed pet rabbits. All I'd need would be a friend for Murgatroyd, and with six rabbits in every litter, I'd have 13 million rabbits in three years. That's all the country needs. (solemn music) Oh. Sorry we're late. We got lost. Oh, you haven't missed anything. We're not sure yet whether we'll be seen. This must be, uh- Celia, yes. Pleased to meet you, young lady. Mr. McElroy will see you now. The children will stay outside. The premier, Mr. Bolte, said today that under no circumstances will these permits be granted. He said the government will stand firm on its decision. Thieves, last night, (switch clicks) broke into a... (solemn music) That makes you happy? (solemn music) (rain pattering) (thunder rumbling) They've changed their minds. They're granting permits. (bright music) Go in. (Celia panting) (bright music) (all chattering frantically) Ha ha, serves you right. Would've found your pet if you had Brer Rabbit. Murgatroyd! (bright music) Are you all right, this time? (somber music) (girls sobbing) I'll get you, John Burke! I thought you said you'd only be five minutes. You'll miss your tennis. I'm ready. Behave yourselves. I won't be long. If Uncle John arrives back before me, pour him a beer. If you don't want to talk to him, come back out here. (Heather laughs) He's a Hobyah. That's him. We'll poison his beer with rat bait. (solemn music) (water thudding) (eerie music) Do you want to pour it? Wait a minute. Where's Celia? I'll just get her. (breath hissing) Hobyah! (Hobyah screeches) (rifle fires) (Heather screams) (rifle clatters) It's all right. The Hobyah is dead. (puppy whimpering) (engine rumbling) (car door thuds) We must take an oath. This is a secret forever and ever. This is a secret forever and ever. I swear on my living heart. Blood will never part. (Celia gasps) (puppy yelping) Shoo, shoo! Hey! (puppy whimpers) Oh! Celia! Heather! Celia! Heather! If you say anything, you'll die in hell. (puppy whimpering) Celia! Heather! Mum! Thank God. How long have you been down here? Since you left. (puppy yelping) (sighs) Come on home. (puppy yelping) (dramatic music) They're here! They're here. (dramatic music) Why the hell didn't you leave a note saying where you were? Thank Christ you're safe. (solemn music) It was my bloody shotgun. I left it loaded. How is he? They can't tell yet. (tense music) Do you know what a gun sounds like? You didn't hear anything like a gunshot? Have you seen any strangers about, anyone at all? Was there no one in the backyard? Or the quarry? Think hard now. (tense music) (body thumps) Celia! (door rattles) Excuse us. You haven't seen a black puppy? Seems Sergeant Burke brought one with him. I know the dog. Not in here. (puppy yelping) (Pat sniffs) (puppy whimpering) Come on there, soldier. I had the most scary nightmare. You've been asleep three days. You had a very bad fever. But you'll have to stay in bed for at least a couple more days. But Heather's coming to stay. No, that was last weekend. Where have you been? Uncle John's funeral. He's dead? There was a terrible accident, Celia. Someone shot him. Well, I'll come by tomorrow. There you are. See that she gets plenty of rest. (puppy barks) Uncle John bought him for you. Found him under the house. You sleep now. We're gonna forget this ever happened. (Ray crying) (solemn music) Class. Welcome back, dear. I'm sorry, Mrs. Burke, but don't worry about Stephanie. I know we want to tell Stephanie how sorry we are. She's a very brave girl, returning to school so soon. And we must take special care of her. Let us pray. Dear God, we ask you to stand by Stephanie and Paul and Mrs. Burke, in this time of great sorrow. We know that you have taken Sergeant Burke for some noble duty. But we cannot help but feel a tragic sense of loss. In this period of mourning, we ask you to bring- Mrs. Casey, Celia's not praying. Celia. Please close your eyes, dear. Celia. Please pray. We ask you to bring Stephanie and her family the peace and happiness they deserve, amen. Amen. (lively music) As we are all aware, Sergeant Burke's murderer goes undetected. I therefore propose this hanging, as a reminder of what will be done to the filthy man when he is caught. Executioner, take your position. I'm the judge. I find you guilty. The death sentence. (solemn music) Sling her. (solemn music) Kill him like he killed your dad. Let the hanging commence. Now! Justice has been done, and the case rests forever. Beat you all to the top of the hill! (solemn music)
