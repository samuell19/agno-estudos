AMBULANCE Gerakan KL from 126. Call! 126, Gerakan KL, go ahead. Gerakan KL from 126. We are on the way to the hospital. Please contact HKL for emergency preparations! 126, Gerakan KL. I've just briefed Chief Police on what happened to Maria. Maria was really lucky, Susan. Because Dr. Faris, who led the surgery, managed to remove the bullet that wounded her. Yes, sir. If not, we would have lost a very dedicated officer. I am also amazed by Maria's bravery, sir. The incident was also widely reported by the media. Because of that, many people are sympathetic. It looks like all our hard work is still appreciated by the public. Sir, I heard that Maria will be in the hospital for about a month. Correct. I will be escorting Chief Police who wants to visit her this evening. Mariana! You are too impulsive. You would even do anything as long as you can get what you want. What are you getting out of this? Let me see it. - It's embarrassing. - Let me see it. Hey! Go away! Get out of here! I hate you. You're no longer my sister. Go away! Go away! Maria! Maria! - Let me go! Let go! - Shut up! Let her go! No! Maria! Maria! Mariana. You're crying, Ana? Why? It's nothing, Mom. Why aren't you asleep yet? How can I sleep? You've been standing here for so long. I don't know, Mom. I've been having trouble sleeping lately. Ana. I know what's going on in your head. Enough of that. Take it all as a blessing from God. As His servant, we should be grateful, no matter how hard the trials that we have to go through. Mom. I've realized the sacrifices and love that Maria has given to me all this time. Enough, Ana. Ana. You have to work tomorrow, right? Go to sleep, dear. Praise be to God. After a week, her condition is now quite stable, even though her body is still weak. I believe that in a few more days, her condition will improve, madam. Doctor. Is there any hope for my daughter to be normal after this? You don't have to worry. Your daughter, Inspector Maria, is a brave woman. I am confident that her will is stronger than some men. Thank you, Doctor. We should be grateful that the bullet that wounded Maria didn't hit anything that could've threatened her life. Doctor. Thank you for saving my life the other day. If not... I can only try, Maria. But everything is according to the will of God. I understand, Doctor. Even so, I will always be grateful for what you have done. Okay, Maria. Enough talking. You need a lot of rest. Don't move too much. Ana. You're not working today? I took the day off. Sis. If you need anything, tell me. I'll get it for you. Thank you. What are you doing? Ana. I want to ask you out for lunch. I'll pick you up at one o'clock, yeah? Thanks, but no thanks, Remy. I don't want to go out. Ask someone else. You don't want to go out with me? It's not that. I just don't want to go out. I'll have my takeaway at the office. If so, Ana, wait here. I'll get takeaways, too, then we can eat together. Eat together like newly-weds. It's fine, Remy. I've asked the office boy to buy it for me. Stop bothering me. Ana. It seems like Remy likes you. Yeah, Mariana. Why did you do that to Remy? Poor him. Oh dear, Ana. What's wrong with Remy? I think he looks quite handsome. Yeah, right. Come on. Follow us. Ask them to come, too. You're gonna get in trouble. It's all empty promises. Right there. You're crazy. Come on. Sam! It's me! Drink up! Okay! - Zana! - What? - Take this. - What is this, Ray? It looks like ecstasy. Take it. It'll relieve your stress. I'm not used to taking it. If you don't, I won't ask you out again. Take it. Take it. Yeah, there you go! Praise be to God, Maria. You've almost recovered. You're recovering faster than I expected. By next week, I think you can be discharged from the hospital. Really, Doctor? Thank you, Doctor. I'm getting restless, too. I've been at the hospital for nearly a month. However, you must remember. You must receive aftercare from me every week. It's important for your recovery. I understand, Doctor. Sir, how's our unit doing? Are there still a lot of cases? Maria. Don't think too much about work. Relax your mind. Oh, right. IGP and Puan Sri sent their regards to you. We pray that you make a speedy recovery. Disco? Sorry. I can't go. I don't want to be involved in the nightlife any longer. Anyway, I've already sold my motorcycle. Please don't take this the wrong way. Ana. Who called? An old friend, Mom. SIX MONTHS LATER Wow, Maria is really eating with gusto, Mom. Why wouldn't she, Ana? She has been craving for her favorite dish for so long. Fish in spicy coconut gravy. When are you going to start working again? Everything depends on my physical condition. The faster, the better. I'm bored if I rest for too long. Maria. Are you going to be in the same department? It's very risky, Maria. I'm happier if you just work at the office. Maria, I'm happy that you're back on the job like before. ONE YEAR LATER - Good morning, sir. - Yes, good morning. Well done, Maria. Headquarters have agreed to keep you in our unit. Thank you, sir. This is due to your support and cooperation. However, I think you should go through physical training first, Maria. No problem, sir. I'm always ready. Good. This is the spirit that every police officer should have if we want the RMP to always be respected. Maria. Susan. I have some business in Bukit Aman. I'll be going now. - Sir. - Yes. Maria, I was actually worried that you'll be transferred to another branch. Anywhere is the same, Susan. But I love our unit more. Today, I want to celebrate. I want to treat you to dinner. Okay? - Set. - Okay. Don't worry, Mom. I know how to take care of myself. And you know, too, I've always liked challenging work. Maria. You're my only hope. And you're also the replacement for your late father. I know my responsibilities, Mom. And I also want to make sure that Mariana has a bright future. She's my little sister, Mom. But I'm afraid of losing you again, Maria. Mom, we don't know when we will die. Don't forget. I almost died... and what happened has made me even stronger. Maria. Parents are usually like that, Maria. Don't take it the wrong way. I believe that your mother really cares about you. I believe she doesn't want you to be a policeman anymore. Maybe what happened to me is still haunting her. Doctor. Do you still need to treat me? Well, you don't actually need it. You've recovered 100%. It's just that... Just what, Doctor? I hope we can meet again. I don't want our relationship to end here. What do you mean? What I mean is if you have any problems, I can be your personal doctor. Personal doctor? How much will that be? No cost at all. I'm ready to help, day or night, free of charge. You're married, yet you're still doing overtime, Mala. There's no use going home early, Ana. My husband isn't always home. When I get back home, he goes out. - Where does he go? - Where else? Driving around on his motorcycle. Like he's single. I'm fed up. You've been married for two years. Have you talked to him? He doesn't care. He neglects me. It's like I don't even have a husband. I pity you, Mala. Okay. I'm going home now. Yeah. Miss. Miss. Why are you crying? Miss. Miss. Why are you crying? Please tell me. What's going on? Nobody can help me with my problems, sis. Why would you say that? What happened? My boyfriend left me. You're crying just because of that? Enough. Go home. Don't cry on the side of the road. I'm scared, sis. I'm pregnant. I don't know what to do now. My boyfriend doesn't want to take responsibility. He doesn't care. - Who's your boyfriend? - Rizman. People call him Ray. Ray? He's the motorhead, right? Yes. Where do you live? With my sister in Cheras. Hey, my dear Mariana! Where did you go? I've been looking everywhere for you. You're looking for me? What is it, Remy? Mariana. You want to go home, right? Come on. I'll give you a lift. I'll take you home. We can ride together, yeah? It's fine, Remy. I can take the bus. Ana, you really don't want to? I really want to take you home. It's come, like... You really want to help me? You think I'm playing around? I'm serious. Come. Let's go home together. Wear this helmet. - You really want to help me? - Yes. If so, take her to her sister's house in Cheras. - Here. - What are you on about? Go home. He will take you home. Ana, who is she? My cousin. She has a bit of a problem. Can you help me or not? I can. Ana, just for you, I'll sacrifice anything. Miss, please sit here. Come. Pull it down. You look beautiful. Ana, she looks like an astronaut. Come on. - Bye. - Bye. Maria. Susan. We have a new task. To root out the syndicate that has been selling ecstasy pills and drugs to teenagers. It's getting serious. Sir, from what I've seen, a lot of these cases have been exposed. Yes, but this problem is ongoing. There are people responsible for this. We can't allow this to escalate. I'm also aware of this, sir. It's a shame drug dealers are targeting teenagers. The syndicate is taking advantage of people's futures to make a profit. When are we starting, sir? Tomorrow. Based on the information that we have, we will be targeting specific places. Check the orders given to you. Ana. - What are you doing, Remy? - I didn't mean it. Are you free tonight? Why? Actually, Ana, I've bought two tickets. I want to ask you out to a movie. What movie? A Hindi film. It's good. Thanks, but no thanks, Remy. I don't have time to watch a movie. But Ana, I bought two tickets. What am I going to do with them? Who told you to buy them? Then who am I going to ask? Just ask your grandmother. You're such a nuisance. That's just sad. Remy. You're way overconfident. You're just wasting your time. Ani, watch your mouth. - Remy. - Yes. Why do you like Mariana so much? We're beautiful, too. - See. - Here. - Both of you are not bad. - Of course. You know. But your bumpers are a bit lacking. This guy! - You're pissing me off. - Why would you say that? Okay. I'll give you movie tickets. A Hindi film. You're such a weirdo! - Hey, friend. - Hey. Cover us. Susan, quick! Let's sit here. Ten minutes. Okay, let's go! Hey! Clean up this table! The usual, man! Hurry up, man. I saw it earlier. Over there, right? - I was shocked. - I know, right. You shouldn't have turned like that. Right. It was fine. - Ray! - Yeah. That's your ex-girlfriend. - Who? - Mariana. She has changed. She's wearing a baju kurung, too. Today's Friday. Have some respect. Before this, she never wore a baju kurung. Ever since she left our group, she has gone soft. Maybe she's a good girl now. Why are you guys so shocked? Women like that are actually ruined. They're forced to act religious just to get some sympathy. She thinks she's so good. - But really, she's just a tramp. - Don't be angry. Ray, you're talking like you're frustrated. You didn't have her, right? That's why you're so butt-hurt. Hey! Watch it. A tramp like that Mariana, even if she gave it to me for free, I wouldn't want it. She's pissed now, guys. If the shoe fits, wear it. Right. I guess it really got to her. - It's true, then? - Probably wears a cap, too. That's hilarious! She's pissed, guys. You nailed it! What a bitch! Let's go! What are you waiting for? Let's go! Let's go. Let's get out of here. We can't do anything, Susan. - Good evening, ma'am. - Yes. We had to release the man we arrested yesterday. We can't keep him in custody without proof. He's sly, Maria. I'm sure he gave it to someone else. Luck is not on our side, Susan. Maria, I'm amazed by your bravery. You immediately swing into action. - Even guys couldn't beat that. - Why? Is it because women are weaker than men? Of course not, but your enthusiasm ever since that incident seems to be bubbling over. You're too enthusiastic. Be careful, Maria. In our line of work, anything can happen. I understand, Susan. Thank you for reminding me. Okay. Good night. Why are you guys so shocked? Women like that are actually ruined. They're forced to act religious just to get some sympathy. I know. You've been ruined before, right? And you almost became a tramp. Let me go! Where do you want to go? Let me go! Watch it. Tramp like that Mariana, even if she gives it to me for free, I don't want it. I don't want it! Tramp! Hey! - Mariana? - Yeah. She's dolled up now. What's going on? Angel during the day, devil at night. What's so shocking? I knew it. This woman is just faking it. That's typical. Ray, shoot. Hi! Hi, Mariana. You're alone? If a dog is so used to eating shit, if it couldn't eat it, even getting the smell is enough. Hello! What's up? Sam! I dare you. If you can melt that ice queen, you have my respect. We can bet on it. She's looking at you, Sam. She's smiling, too. Aren't you tempted? Go on, Sam. How much? - Two hundred? - That's okay, Sam. When else will you show your skills? Come on! Go on! What are you waiting for! She's hooked, Ray. Oh no. This is impossible. You're never gonna get her now. Sam is incredible. Ray. He got her. You'll have to watch now. Room number 12, at the end of the hall. - Boss. - Yeah. How is it? Will people check on us? Don't be afraid. I guarantee that the religious department won't check here. Everything is clear. Really? How long do you want the room for? - Three hours. - All right. Mariana. Let's go. Come in, Mariana. We can rest up here. Mariana. Mariana. I've been missing you for so long. Relax. You're so eager. Come on. It's not eagerness. - I just can't hold it in. - Hang on. - Let me have a smoke first. - No can do. - It's going to smell. - Whatever. Oh no. I don't have any more cigarettes. It's fine. I have some. Take it. I don't smoke this brand. I want to go out and buy a pack. - You? - It's fine. I can buy it for you. Let me go. Do you want anything? Yes! Get me some stout and peanuts. Okay. Wait for me. - I'll wait. - Really? Okay. Don't go anywhere. Hurry up. Hello. I am. Who are you? What? Why is she so slow? Don't tell me she tricked me. What a waste of time. You lecherous man! Looks like you forgot about your wife and kids. What? You're just looking for trouble! - You're dead! - Wait! - You're such a pervert! - Hey! You're going to get it! What's going on? - This is all your fault. - I didn't do anything! - You want to run? - Mala, you're embarrassing me. Sleeping at this hotel isn't embarrassing enough? And you said you were working overtime. I'm going to get you! Now you know. Serves you right, you little shit. Hi. You're alone? Aren't you scared? Where are you going at midnight? Why are you so curious? Mind your own business! I'm sorry if I'm a busybody. My name is Sazali. I didn't even ask. I'll take you home. It's not good walking alone at night. - It's dangerous. - There's no need. I can get home on my own. I don't even know you. Go away. I have good intentions. Your sister is Inspector Maria, right? How did you know? KL is not that big. Besides, your sister is famous in the police force. I've seen her picture in the newspaper, on TV. Your sister is amazing. I still remember the story about her saving you becoming big news. Mariana! What's wrong with you? Are you going back to your old habits? Ana. Do you have a problem? Your sister is always getting into trouble. She still hasn't changed, Maria? I'm confused too, Susan. She's a little bit different. I can't read her. She's still your sister. You can't let her go about aimlessly. I don't know, Susan. I feel guilty. I feel sorry for you, Maria. You're so busy with Mariana that you're neglecting yourself. How did it go with Doctor Faris? - Hey, Mat! - Yeah. Did you see Mariana? - Mariana? - Yes. She left with Ray. What? Ray went out with Mariana? Mariana. Where are you taking me? Come on, Ana. We'll relax here for a bit, okay? Sit here. What is this place? Relax, Ana. Lie down. Lie down here first. Just relax. Maria. Yes, Mom? Is something wrong? Your sister is up to something again. She sneaked out. I'm worried, Maria. I can't let her do this again, Mom. She has gone too far. Why did you tie me up, Ana? Let me go! What are you going to do to me? Untie me! Untie me! This is the first time I see a man scared of a woman. Ana, you bitch! Let me go! Shut up! You're trapped by a woman that you thought was just your plaything. Damn you! You better let me go. Let me go! You think you can trick me with your pills like what you did with the other girls? You want to satisfy your lust, Ray, without thinking about how it affects other people. Hey! Why do you care? I can do whatever I want! What if someone rapes your sister, Ray? Will you accept that? Stop talking nonsense! You bitch! Remember, Ray, you've tried to rape me and spread rumors about me previously. Now, why are you still bothering me? Why? You're angry that you didn't get to rape me, right? Don't act like you're a saint, Ana! I know who you are. You used to be a tramp! What are you going to do with that stick, Ana? Ana! Stop, Ana! Are you crazy? Please, Ana. Don't do this to me. What have you become, Ana? What have you become? You go out whenever you please. You come back in the middle of the night. You're out of control! You only think about yourself. You don't care about our feelings. Ana. Haven't you learned from your mistakes before? Why are you like this? Don't ruin your life, Ana. Think about your future. I know what I'm doing, Mom. I'm old enough to do what I want. How dare you! Maybe you would prefer to see your sister die. So that you can do what you want. That's what you want, right? Maria. Thank you for slapping me. Ana. I apologize for slapping you earlier. No, Sis. I respect what you did. Maria. I'm sorry for always turning down your invites, Doctor. It's not that I don't want to, but my job is unpredictable. Why are you so serious? Maria. I have to tell you something important. What's so important, Doctor? You're not usually this serious. Well, I'll be honest. Maybe a doctor like me isn't very eloquent with words, Maria. I also can't ignore the fact ever since I met you a year ago. Go on. I'm listening. If you're willing, I would like to marry you, Maria. Why not, Maria? I approve of Doctor Faris. He's very courteous. And he's quite good-looking, handsome. I haven't thought about it, Mom. There's still a lot to deal with. Don't wait too long, Maria. I think you suit each other. You don't want to be an old maid, right? What are you saying? I'll think about it later. Besides, if it's possible, Mariana should get married first. Oh, you. I don't even have a boyfriend, let alone getting married? Really, Ana? You must have one, right? Ana might be too picky. Hello. Oh, Mom. Mariana. Why aren't you home yet? It's already eight o'clock. I'm doing overtime. Some urgent business I need to complete. Don't worry, Mom. I'll be back before ten. Okay. Bye, Mom. Your mom, huh? Ana. You don't normally do overtime. I'm trying to earn some extra money. I went a little over budget this month. What about you? Right now, Ana, I need to work a little bit harder. You know, ever since I got this car, my monthly expenses increased. Why don't you use your motorcycle? It's not like you don't know. I have a lot of siblings. Sometimes I need to take my mom to the hospital. Really, now? Or are you trying to get me to like you? That's true, too. You weirdo. What is that sound, Remy? That's the turbo. Turbo? What turbo? Your car smells like smoke. Pull over. Ana! Why are you touching me? I'm not trying to touch you. I just want to calm you down, Ana. You're crazy! Ana. Ana, wait. Ana, just wait until I get my car repaired. Then we can go home together. No need! I'm taking a taxi. Oh no, Ana. It's the motorheads whose table you flipped. Oh no, relax everyone. He's staring like that now. That guy is also here. Hey, don't you dare look for trouble with me. You don't know who I am. Ana, wait! Wait, Ana! Ana, wait! What are you doing? What are you doing? Ouch. Hey, what are you doing? Ana! Surround her! Where are you running to? Grab her clothes! - Don't run! - Go after her. Quick! - Where are you running to? - Get her. - Let me go! - You told my wife, huh? This time, you're gonna get it. Hey! - Hey! I'm going to get you. - Let me go. Hey! Let go! Let her go! - You think you can beat us? - You wanna be a hero? Take this! Let me go! Let me go! Let go! - Who's this guy? - Don't interfere. - Move aside! - Who is this guy? Or you're going to get it. Help me! Surround him! Catch him. Watch out! Beat him up! Hey! Let's get out of here. Run. Let's go, everyone. Who is he, Ana? Wait! The man knows who I am? Yes. The first time I met him, he said he knew us both through the TV and newspaper, a year ago. Right. No wonder he knew. Thank God, there are kind people out there. Ana, I think you should meet the guy. We would like to thank him. I'll see what I can do. Have you made a police report? I did. At the Brickfields Police Station. I'll follow up on that later. Actually, I know a lot about the motorheads' activities, Sis. They are involved in distributing ecstasy pills and possibly even drugs. How do you know? Am I not an undercover tramp? - A tramp? - Yeah. So you've been going undercover, huh? No wonder you've been going out late at night. And you got slapped for no reason. Ouch! Why are you looking for me? Wasn't everything settled? You're safe. What's important now is for you to take care of yourself. Don't wander around in the middle of the night. It's dangerous. My family sends their regards. Especially Maria. She wants to meet you. She wants to meet me? Yes. What for? Zali! What's wrong with you, Zali? Why didn't you pick me up? I had to take a taxi, you know? Sorry, Rozi. My bike has a little bit of a problem. What about your car, then? Is it just for decoration? You know I don't like to drive cars, right? Let me introduce you. Mariana. Rozi. The singer at this club. Hi. Why are you singing during the day? I have practice. Have you eaten? Not yet. Let me treat you to lunch. Well, this is backwards. I should be treating you. But not right now. I'll let you know a suitable time. Okay. Where are you from? Singapore. I'm actually an ex-commando. No wonder he's good at fighting. I heard that you're managing a club at Jalan Pinang, right? Yes. I'm a manager at the club. I'm also partnered in a small business. So how's business right now? Okay. It's promising. Excuse me. Hello. Yes. Where? All right. I'm on my way. Oh dear. It seems like we can't go for lunch today. Next time. Why? I need to go back. There's important business. Urgent. I'm sorry, Sazali. Lunch with Mariana. God willing, we'll meet again. Okay? - Bye. - Bye. I didn't expect it. Let's go. Take him. Thanks for lunch, Ana. It's a shame Maria couldn't join. Why don't you come for dinner at my house? With Maria and my mom. Just call me whenever. Oh no, it's already three. Please hurry up, Zali. I'm late. - Okay. - My boss will be angry. Susan. Maria. The chemical report confirms the stuff that you found is starch and cough drops. It's not drugs. That's impossible. Our information is not wrong. We even spied on him, sir. We have to release him. We have no evidence to prosecute him. - Sergeant. - Sir. Stand up. I disagree with your decision in releasing him so quickly. We should've at least pushed him about it first, sir. I think so too, sir. We've been played. Don't get too emotional, you two. Our officers will be keeping an eye on him. Understand? You want to send me to Bangkok? Yes. For what, Zali? Why so suddenly? My business partner needs help. They just opened a club there. They need our help. So? How about this club? Let me finish up my business here. Don't worry. It's important for you to sort out your passport. I'm tired of going to Bangkok, Zali. Just find someone else. Rozi. A new club needs a great singer like you to attract customers. Don't disappoint me, okay? Yes. Who are you talking to? I'm talking to Zali. You seem close lately. I don't know. Lately, he's been calling me a lot. Maybe he likes you. That's impossible. I'm not beautiful like you. Who said my sister is not beautiful? A sharp nose, cute eyes, sexy. - And then? - Let me add more to the list. A slim waist, beautiful eyebrows. And the most beautiful part of my daughter is her hips. - It's sexy! - It's sexy! What are you saying? Oh dear. I've been waiting for a month. You still haven't answered. Please, Maria. I'm still waiting for your answer. I apologize for making you wait. Maybe it's just my destiny. It's like waiting for the impossible. However, I will be waiting patiently, Maria. I realized. I owe my life to you, Faris. The doctor that saved me from the clutches of death. The truth is, I like you. Don't force yourself because of sympathy, Maria. No. I honestly meant every word. I've accepted your proposal a long time ago. There's one thing. What is it, Maria? I want to see my sister, Mariana, get married first. Are you willing to wait, Faris? Get it, no matter what! Otherwise, we have a problem. Look for it! If it's so hard, shut down the club. Why would you do business if there's no profit? What's wrong, Zali? Is there a problem? Our business is suffering. We're still looking for a replacement for Rozi. When we got a new singer, lots of customers didn't like it. A lot went to other places. Zali. Can I ask you something? Why don't you start another business? Why? Are you disgusted with my work? Huh? I'm trying to make an honest living. It's not like I'm robbing people or a pimp. Sorry, Zali. Don't get so emotional. I didn't mean it like that. So what you mean is my business revolves around alcohol and vices. Is that it? Vices are everywhere. It's important to be sincere. I don't want to be a hypocrite. You can't do this, you can't do that. A saint in front of other people but a devil behind closed doors. Mariana. I didn't mean to hurt your feelings. Forgive me. You should know that I don't even like my own business. This is only temporary. I want to save some money for a year or two to start a new life. Open up a new and better business. Look, Zali. About your business, I think I can help you out. That is if you believe in my talents. What? You want to be a singer at Sazali's club now? Hey! Don't look for trouble, Ana. I don't like it. Mom, it's only a part-time job. I'll work at the office during the day. I just want to help Zali, Mom. Besides, it's only for two to three months while he's looking for another singer. I can't even do that? Can you even sing? A little bit, Mom. I won the talent competition at school. You work during the day and you sing at night. You won't be able to handle it. I don't agree. Come on. You're so fussy. I don't agree either, Ana. People are not going to like it. You're young and single. Mom. Maria. Why can't we help someone who has helped us before? This is just a small favor. What do you think, Mom? Mariana. You're not going to work? I'm a little bit under the weather, Mom. I thought so. You work during the day, sing at night. You come home at one in the morning. No wonder you're getting sick. It's not because of that, Mom. Has the club found a replacement? Not yet, Mom. I only started singing there. It's only been a month. Mariana. Everyone around here now knows you're singing at a nightclub. So? Are you ashamed of me? It's not that. Your relationship with Sazali also worries me sometimes. I'm confused too. Why did you let your sister sing at the club even though you were against it at first? I don't know, Susan. The truth is, my mom and I have no choice. Mariana wants to repay Sazali's deeds. How long will she be singing there? Two to three months. It's only part-time. But I'm still worried. You know those kinds of places. Anything can happen. My sister is still inexperienced. What about Sazali? What is their relationship like? I'm not sure. I know they are getting closer. You have saved my business, Mariana. Business at the club is starting to look up. I'm amazed by your talent. It's also because of your support. I wouldn't be as confident otherwise. That's what we call a hidden talent. If it's nurtured, you can be a famous recording artist. Oh, please. I'm not interested. I'm just singing for fun. Why are you looking at me like that? I want to stare at your beautiful face. The face of the sweet girl who always appears in my dreams. All men say that. After that, trouble starts. I've had enough, Zali. You've been disappointed before? Do you want to know about what I've been through? You'll be disappointed if you do. Close that chapter in your life. I just want to have your heart and soul, Ana, not your past. Wow! It's such a beautiful ring. Why did you buy me this ring? It's just for you. As a sign of our love. Are you sincere? Do I have to answer that? You're too kind to me, Zali. I'm going now, Ana. Ana, wait. I have to talk to you, Ana. What is it? I want to go home. But let's talk somewhere else. Can we talk in private in the coffee room? - Oh no, not room. - What's wrong with you? We can talk at the cafe. Oh, please. I don't have time to play around with you. Just tell me. It's not like anybody's here. Everyone has left. Everybody's gone home, huh? Actually, Ana, I'm a little bit embarrassed... - Spill it already! - I want to marry you. I want to propose to you. Marriage? Propose? What are you talking about? The truth is, I want to ask my mom to ask you to marry me next month. Ana. You want to propose to me? Ana, don't lift your eyebrows. I'm scared. Who wants to get married to me? I do. I don't love you. I love you. I've never had feelings for you. But I do. Ana, we can get married first. After that, we can fall in love. Then we'll have feelings for each other. It's impossible, Remy. Ana, wait! Ana! I will send my family to propose to you, Ana. You're crazy. Here's the special stuff. Don't move! You are under arrest. Mom. You've been doing a lot of flower arrangements lately. I just cleaned them up. Are you not going out today? No, Mom. I want to rest as much as I can today. Mom. I have something important to tell you. What is it? Look, Mom. Sazali told me. His family will be coming to meet you. For what? Sazali wants to get engaged to me, Mom. We're planning to get married next year. Why are you quiet? You don't want me to marry Sazali? Ana. I agreed that you could sing at the nightclub. Please don't abuse that. I won't deny that you are indebted to Sazali, but that doesn't mean you have to give everything to him. Marriage is a serious matter, Ana. Once you've made a mistake, you'll regret it forever. Mom. Why can't it be Sazali? Why can't you accept him? Don't misunderstand me, Ana. It's not that I can't accept Sazali, but as a Muslim and as a Malay, it's hard for me to accept a son-in-law who is involved in that kind of business. But, Mom. Sazali promised to open up a new business. Prove it first. Only then will I reconsider. Let Sazali know. For now, I can't accept his family's wish to meet me. I hope you understand. Mom. I heard everything. Enough, Ana. Don't be sad. Be strong, Ana. Maybe this is my destiny, Sis. To never find the happiness that I seek. There's always an obstacle. Maybe this is the retribution for my past sins. Don't say that. Happiness can be found if we're honest and sincere. We must also realize that as human beings, it's impossible for us to have everything we want because we're not perfect, Ana. Maria. Sazali brought light into my life. I understand. As a woman, I can also feel what you're feeling right now. Thank you, Sis, for understanding how I feel. Actually, I like Sazali, too. But you have to understand what Mom meant earlier. As our mother, she can reprimand us. Don't take it to heart. There's truth in what your mother is saying, Ana. Even though it's hard to swallow. Forgive me, Zali. My mom didn't mean to belittle you. She has good intentions. I understand. Please give me some time to sort out my business first. I am looking at other possibilities at the moment. After that? After everything is done, I'll fulfill your mother's request. Trust me. After interrogating Malik, we received crucial information that we failed to notice all this time. A famous club at Jalan Pinang has been used as the center for the distribution of drugs. You mean X Club? Correct. That's impossible, sir. Maybe Malik is just saying that to free himself. This is not merely a claim, Maria. Our detailed investigation has confirmed it. However, we will only be taking action when we have all the information we need. Sir. May I know who the prime suspect is? The owner of X Club, Sazali Osman. Sis. Ana. Can I talk to you? What is it? Ana. Do you love our family? Maria. Who else do I have other than you and Mom? To me? What kind of a sister would I be if I didn't love you? Ana. If I ask you to do something, would you do it? Of course. I would do anything for you. What is it? Leave Sazali. What? What are you talking about? He's not suitable for you. Sis! Maria! Maria! Wait! I want to know why. Why? Maria. Ana. What's going on? Mom. What's going on? Why does everyone hate Sazali? Yesterday, you refused to meet Sazali's family, and tonight, Maria is telling me to leave Sazali. Why, Mom? What did he do wrong? Don't ask why. For the honor of our family, break up with him immediately. Understand? What's going on, Maria? I pray day and night that you and Mariana would come to an understanding. But all of my hopes... I didn't plan this, Mom. What's happening is best and for Mariana's future. But your sister is stubborn. She has always been a rebel. Calm down, Mom. I'm sure Mariana will change. Believe me. Rozi! Who told you to come back? Who told you to come back without telling me? You're supposed to stay there! I now know what you're up to, Sazali. You sent me to Bangkok on purpose because you had other plans here. You think I don't know what you're doing while I'm not here? You're having a love affair with Mariana. That's my business. Don't interfere. Then? Who am I to you, Zali? Lover or mistress? Remember, Zali. I am not Mariana, a woman that you can fool. Rozi. Please don't be jealous. Trust me. I love you. What I'm doing is only temporary. The club needs to operate for at least another year so that we can get as much profit as possible. Mariana is just a means to an end. Nothing more than that. So what are you doing right now? Mariana will continue to sing at the club. No! Break up with her or our partnership ends here. Rozi, we need Mariana to stay. I don't care! Rozi! Rozi. Rozi. Mariana. What are you looking for here in the dead of night? Looking for your lover? Wanting to spend the night with Sazali? Sorry if I ruined your plans for tonight. Don't misunderstand, Rozi. We don't have to fight. We can solve our problems amicably. I just need you to be honest with me. Ana. Mom. Mom. Forgive me, Mom. Forgive me. Maria. What's wrong, Mariana? What's the problem? You suddenly want to stop singing. The faster, the better. I no longer want to be your means to an end. Means? What are you talking about? - I... - Enough! I don't need your explanation. From now on, Rozi can take over from me. You saw Rozi? That's not important. The fact is, our relationship is over. I know. Rozi has poisoned your mind. Don't blame her, Zali. Men have always toyed with women. Mariana. Let me go. I'll never let a hypocrite like you touch me. Forgive me, Mariana. I admit my mistake, but trust me. I really love you. Enough. I'm tired of talking with a man like you. Your presence has actually matured me in my search for the meaning of life. Don't you dare think I'm a fool, Zali. I've said everything. I've won. And now you're done for. Do you know what you've done, Rozi? Everything that we did will be revealed! You'll also pay the price, idiot! All of that can go to hell! I want my cut now, Zali. Give it back now! I don't want to be involved in your illegal activities anymore. It's not that easy, Rozi. I will never let you go. Zali, our club is being raided! This is all because of you, Rozi! Dammit! Stay where you are and don't try anything. We will be inspecting this whole area. Cooperate with us. Maria, quick! Move. Take cover! Chase him! Go! Stop! Don't run! Surrender, now! Surrender, now! You won't escape, Sazali. Come out, you coward! Sazali! Come out, Sazali! Come out! Enough with your act. You used my sister to cover up your illegal activities. You've made a mistake, Sazali. You've made a mistake! Come out, you coward! Surrender, now! Don't think you can play with Mariana's feelings. I won't let you ruin my sister. Come out, you coward! Show yourself! Your life of crime ends here. Come out! Show yourself! Get up! Quick! I said get up! Why are you looking for trouble? You're wasting your time hunting me down, Maria. Sorry. I need to get rid of you. Maria! Maria! O Allah, my God. I seek protection for my children. O Allah. We ask for Your forgiveness and good health. And Your blessings forever. In religion, in this world, and the next. Amen. This is the happiest day for me. Praise be to God. Our prayers for you have been granted. Remember my advice. Be a good wife. I promise, Mom. After this, it's your sister's and Doctor Faris' turn. The wedding must be this year. Don't, Mom. He'll be snatched away! It has to be this month. - Really? - Yes. WE CAN ONLY PLAN BUT GOD DECIDES EVERYTHING. Subtitle translation by Hajar Idris
