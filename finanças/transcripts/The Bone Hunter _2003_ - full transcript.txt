[gentle music] [yelling] [metal clanking] [grunting] [knives squelching] [wind howling] - [Ethne] Why don't we buy an ox? - With what, Ethne? - Grandfather Roderick could help us. - Now lift up. - Are you Fingal, brother of Dougal? - Name your business! - Come to enlist your aid in a search for a hostage. Domall of Trool. I knew your half brother, Dougal. Some people say we looked so much alike we may have been brothers. - Dougal's father was a drunkard. - Ay, I like a drink myself, before we go hunting Angles. One of the Angles roaming parties have captured the bride to be of my chief. - He doesn't think she's worth very much. - She's his brother's widow. He's only after her lands and by all accounts she's as ugly as sin. - What's you chief's name? - Cathen, protector of the Wall. - Gwendoleu's father! He fought against us at Arthuret. - He had no choice. None of us had any choice. Let us bury our differences. - Take the goats and go to your grandfather's. - Will I show him the coins? - He'll know what it means. Now, go. Where the Angles keeping her? - We find out tomorrow when we meet at Cunedda's Stone. [gentle music] Do you not have a woman, Fingal? - [Fingal] Jessica died of the plague. [dramatic music] - Why don't you give her to Rolf? He's lonely. - He's too simple for her. Look, she's got Eastern manners, she's not going to do anything she doesn't want to. - And I do? I know what you like, Aedgar. Isn't that not enough for you? - It's all those years in a Celtic convent. You're ignorant of the ways of the world, Tannu. Go fetch me some food. Bring her to me! What's your name? - Why don't you guess? If you get it right, I'll sleep with you. [laughing] - Hear that, lads? She's game for it. All right, by the looks of you, it's got to be something Roman like, Anastasia, or Justinia or Constancia. [chuckles] - Those are Roman whore names. - Then Let my men try. First one to guess her name so have her. Come on then! - Ingva. - Greta [laughing]. - Frida! - Bertha. - Come on, [mumbles]. [laughing] You know you can't read, Rolf, go take watch! [mumbles], Aethelstan. - Can't you read either? - Sometimes I choose to forget what I read. - You find me attractive, don't you? - That is not the issue. You are a hostage. You are worth something to someone. - So say my name, for what is life without complications? - What good will it do me? - I am rich. - Oh? - Don't give up me to some old man while I am still young. Say my name and we will be lovers. - Hennini. - Louder, let her hear it. - Hennini. - He's besmitten by her. - We must get rid of her, Rolf. It'll be our little secret. [tranquil music] - How can I march with that in my belly? Where's Aedgar? - He's hunting with Aelfred and Aethelstan. - I'll have meat when he returns. [thunder rumbling] - Is this him? - I will speak for myself. You want me to fetch this woman for you? What's wrong with your own men? - They have families. You, on the other hand, I care nothing for. You bore my son's head on a spear. - The world needed to know the fighting was over. - Gwendoleu was a great general. - You put him under the guidance of that wizard Mydrinn. Your son nearly destroyed our nation. - Bring the Roman. - I am Marcella of Constantinople. I was employed by a Greek monk but he perished when our ship wrecked. He said he was being directed by an angel to carry the bones of the martyr Andrew to the ends of the earth. - Andrew, the first apostle? Where are the bones now? - My brother's widow has them. That vixen has no scruples. - Perhaps you would be happier if she were dead. You could inherit your brother's lands without the need of marriage. - The Angles are our enemies! We should be fighting them. - So be it. Name the place where the Angles are stationed, I'll do the rest. - The fort of Vindolandia. Go with him! [sombre music] - How long have you been stationed in this country? - A year, I like it. Once we've cleared off all the Celts, I'll build a farm. - You're such a pagan. Don't you want to live in a town, and have clean clothes, and take baths? - No, Northumbrian towns are full of immigrant pigs living in their own filth. My parents gave up their small farm north of Angeln to sail across the Germanic Sea in a long boat that cost them everything to build. When they got here, they found a land of bribed officials and religious bigots. They acquired no wealth and died pining for the old country. I want none of that. The only way to get rich is to take it. - [Hennini] You believe in plunder and murder? - Kill or be killed! We Angles are not very popular with the Celts. They believe we sacrifice our children to Woden. [laughing] How did you come to be a widow? - My father arranged for me to marry Theodoric when I was twelve. He was forty two. King Urien appointed him as his counsel in Constantinople. I had to go with him. My father's land and castle passed to Theodoric and myself. But now that he's is dead, I've got to marry his brother Cathen or lose it all. - Are they rich lands? - The richest you have ever seen. - Is the castle in good repair? - It's magnificent. It sits high on a cliff overlooking the sea. - Then what you need is a young healthy husband to keep it that way, not a rich old man. You must marry me. - My people on my land will never accept an Angle as their overlord. - Then we must give then an heir. [gentle music] - What is this place? - These are the ruins of [mumbles]. Wait here. [dramatic music] Domall. [laughing] [swords clanking] - [Domall] I thought you said the war was over. - You always need something in reserve. [dramatic music] - Angle country. - Ay, used to be ours. [dramatic music] - Praise God. I've found a Christian at the end of the earth. - What's your name? - Regulus. - Regulus? [laughing] - Everybody thought you had drowned, Regulus. [laughing] - Oh it was a miracle, my son. It was, a miracle. A huge wave lifted me from the water and threw me onto the shore. This country is in ruins. - The war. We ate what we could get our hands on. Burnt what we couldn't eat. We've lost everything our ancestors left us. - Everything except for greed, envy, pride, corruption, revenge. - Our troubles with Angles. - From what I have heard, you Celts are just as cruel. Just as unjust as the Angles. - You listen to too much Roman cowshit. - The Romans know that they were corrupt. Celts, Angles. They just deny it to themselves. - You know, you're awful lippy for a priest. [grunting] - Forgive him, Reg. He's ignorant. - That's it lad, concentrate - He is forgiven [laughing]. - That's it, lad, concentrate. Concentrate. Keep up your guard, you have to keep up your guard. - How long have you been Aedgar's camp follower? - Don't try and small talk me, I have your measure. - Aedgar is mine now. Why don't you get a liking for that love wet Rolf. He'd be good to you. - He has no education. I can read. - Out here I don't think you have a mind to use what you've read. - You're a bitch. - I know, but I am not a camp whore. You don't need to be one either. - Stay here, Reg. - I must speak with Lady Hennini. - You want to die squealing like a pig? The Angles will have you roasted on a [mumbles]. - Let's go Domall. [drums beating] [yelling] [knives squelching] [metal clanking] - Tie them up. - What's your business here? - [Fingal] You have stolen a man's bride. - Have we now? What's your name, Celt? - Ask your friend there. - What's got into him? - He's been demented ever since he escaped from the Celts last year. - If I chop this one's head off, maybe he'll talk. - My name is Fingal! - He's the one who killed Ida and his brothers last winter. - There's a bounty on his head, Aedgar. - There'll be a bigger one on his if he doesn't let her go. - She is mine now. Isn't that right, my beloved? - Ay, of my own freewill, I have agreed to marry Aedgar. - What's this then, Aedgar? - That's right, lads. The lass wants me. - Untie me, I will take the message to chief Cathen and let him know he has been jilted. [laughing] - Oh, if we were that foolish. - Let them run the arrow! [horns tooting] - What is that? - Our only chance. - Ay, let them. [intense music] [yelling] - How's the wound? - It's not good. - Good bye, Domall. [yelling] [intense music] [grunting] [metal clanking] [intense music] - We'll catch him later. - [Regulus] How are your feet? - Bloody sore. - Did you get to see the bones? - I saw nothing but Angles. - How's Lady Hennini? - She's no lady. She's wedding the Angle leader. [laughing] - You should have let me come, too. I could have performed the ceremony. This. - Where did you get that? - I picked it up. It's the reason why I sank when I was thrown into the sea. This was a gift from Childebert, king of the Franks. This was the sword of Conan of Amorica. - Conan the Barbarian? I underestimated you, Reg. - Well, it's understandable. I'm not looking my best. Look, man is born with a tiny spark of goodness in him. That spark is God, everything else is ugliness and evil. That spark must be guarded like a treasure, it must be nurtured, it must be sparked into a flame. The bones will be the spark for the mother church in this country and the teachings of Jesus as Andrew heard them. Lady Hennini, whatever her flaws, she is a true believer. She will pass on the spark, fan the flames. [dramatic music] - If Aedgar marries you he'll soon have long hair and a cross around his neck. - He will be rich while you become fat weaning the bastard children of these soldiers. - You know nothing of me. I left a convent, crimson with shame, dreading pursuit, to hide my faith in his arms. Now I am no longer a virgin, Aedgar scorns me. - I misjudged you. - Like you, I am a Celt. My real name is Constancia, but if I am captured and my secret discovered, I will be sentenced to death. - I prefer it when you two argue. Tomorrow we'll leave for your lands. - What about your duties? - I have orders to do as I please. We'll leave Hussa behind to guard the empire! Right then. - Leave me, Rolf. - I want to help. - This is my penance for breaking my vows. - Life with us is not that bad. - This is no life. - I'll kill Aedgar for you. He shamed you. - No, Rolf. - I've carved ruins for you, Tannu. - I know. [dramatic music] - Shh! Regulus is alive and wants his bones back. - I don't believe you! The sword of Conan! - [Aedgar] Hennini! - I'm passing water! The bones are safe in my bundle. Come to me at dusk. I'll give you a signal. - You're coming, too. - No, no, Aedgar's going to challenge Cathen for me. If you don't agree, I'll call out. - You're a traitor. - If you believe that of me, then you value duty over love. - [Aedgar] You look troubled. - It's a woman's burden to worry, and a man's task to reassure her. - I'll have one of the lads help you carry this. - [Hennini] No, they dislike me enough. I must earn their trust. - Fair enough. [drums beating] - [Hennini] You're safe. - [Regulus] And well bathed [laughing]. Do you have the relics? - I have, right here. It kept me safe. [punch thuds] - I thought you were going to be gentle? - [Fingal] It'd take a smith's hammer to break her jaw, come. [drums beating] [grunting and yelling] - You are devils doing this to me! - It's common for ransom victims to fall in love with their abductors. You'll get over it. - You are a brute. You drug me through the mud like an animal on it's way to market! I am a civilised person! Have you never heard of horse and cart? People do not have to live like this! This is barbaric! - Look, lady, it was your idea to marry that Angle, not mine. - Father, please untie me. I won't run away, I promise, I give my word! - Untie her, Fingal. [hollering] Who are these? - They're Picts, let me deal with 'em. - Look who we have here then. - He's the one that got my brother killed! - Come now, friends, that was Angle, doing not mine. - He's right, Beth. - He took my dress, I want paying for it. - We have nothing that would interest you. - I don't know, he's got a bad looking cloak. - I want her dress! - You'll have to pay us for the use of this road. - You'll have the cold tip of my sword if you touch her. - You're well rid of her, Aedgar. - What makes you think she ran off? - What makes you think she didn't? - She would have taken something with her. - [Aedgar] She's been snatched. - By who? - The Celt, we should have killed him! - It was her idea to let him run the arrow. - Quiet! There is only one place they could be going, to her lands. - How are we going to find that? - Tannu is from the Wall lands, she can guide us. - No, Aedgar, please, I'm can't go back there. - What are you worried about? We'll protect you. What do you say, lads. Up for a raid? - Ay! - Ay! - I'm all for it. - Is it worth it? Why don't we go home? - You're going soft on me, Rolf. That's her doing, working on you, eating away at you. You should just force yourself on her. She likes it. - You are cruel, Aedgar. - Rolf's getting to be bad company. He should go home and take up brewing beer. - No! If I plan to challenge Cathen, we must be strong. [gentle music] - [Rolf] Pack your bags, we're moving out. [upbeat music] - That thing'll never fit you. - [Luis] What is this? - [Regulus] I am a holy man. - Get them away from me! - Ever see you again, I'll make you pay. - Hear that, Luis? He's threatening us. - For old time's sake, we never took anything from him. [upbeat music] [gentle music] - [Hennini] How many more bandits are there in this country? - Are we talking Picts, Angles or chief's like Cathen? We're lucky to be alive. Long life these days is unlikely. - [Regulus] It's all part of the adventure. - What are you so cheerful about? I've never been so miserable. I'd be better off dead. - That could be arranged. Cathen would like to see you dead. I was sent to collect the bones, not you. - That double crossing old goat! He wants to take Caerlaverock from me. - You wanted to marry the Angle. - That's different! - How? - Well, Cathen's twenty, no, thirty years older than me! - You know the law. A Widow must marry or lose all their property to the next of kin. - Don't tell me about the stupid law! I was happy to get away from this horrid country. - There's nothing wrong with this country that can't be fixed. - Everything is broken. You can't fix something that has been smashed into a thousand pieces! - You can try. You can marry Cathen and turn an old man's bitterness into something that rebuilds this land. - What is there worth rebuilding? - Your own sense of purpose. Use your strength and your knowledge to help your people. - I am beyond all that. - She is a lost cause. We don't need her kind here. - You are wrong, Fingal. Hennini has strengths no one yet has seen. She will come into her own. [gentle music] - No! It is ruined. - What happened here? - Gwendoleu raised his forces here. King Urien ordered it destroyed after his defeat. - [Regulus] Up, child. You are being tested by God. [gentle music] - Marcellos, God bless you. - Ethne! How are you, girl? - Is this her? You were no more than a little girl the last time I saw you. Where are the bones? - I have them. - And who might you be? - I might ask the same question. - Gentlemen, please, we are civilised men. You must be the venerable Regulus. Welcome to our humble land. I spent some time in Rome and heard all about your work in Constantinople with the sick and poor, come! - Go with your grandfather. - Who's he? - Roderich is my daughter's grandfather. He is also the new governor of the Wall lands and Strathclyde. - It is an injustice. He was nothing more than a petty chief before now. - Then justice is not blind. I do not need to marry him at all! - The law proscribes that I have the right to marry my brother's wido and that she cannot refuse me. - What would you be getting? Just a pile of rubble and the title Lord of Caerlaverock! - All my titles have been stripped of me and all my lands confiscated because of my son's defeat. This castle, ruined though it may be, will be my new home. - Over my dead body! You ruined your son and your son has ruined us all. I will not have you! - I demand my right. And that's the end of the matter! Roderich will be informed. And we will be married in the morn before all assembled. [sombre music] - Give me your hands. Are you, Hennini of Caerlaverock, free of all disease? - I know not. - Are you with any other man's child? - I know not. - What is this! She tries to find reason for me to give up my claim on her. - I hope I am with child. Angle child! [grunting] - What kind of woman are you? - Enough, you will marry her. If there is a child you will bring it up to be your heir! - Is this man free of disease of the mind? - He is. - This is a marriage, sworn on the bones of an apostle, before God and under the laws of this land. Henceforth, Hennini, widow of Theodoric of Caerlaverock, will be the property of Cathen of Rheged, now lord of Caerlaverock, master of Strathnith, defender of the Wall. In custom, all here assembled are bid to witness this declaration, and say ay. - [All] Ay! [screaming] [intense music] - Guard the true faith, my son. Go. - I am here to claim her as my bride. - She's already wed, Angle. - Not of my own free will! - Where is the old swine? [yelling] [intense music] [grunting] - Aedgar! [metal clanking] [grunting] - The Angles! They've got the bones! [sombre music] - I will throw these in the sea! Give me Hennini! - No, you can't have her. - Tannu! - You fool, Rolf. Let's go! - We can't just leave her! - Then I'll see you in the Other World. [waves crashing] - Woden is with us, Rolf! Let's go! - Someone has to get the bones back. - It's Cathen's business now. - He is not to be trusted. You're family, you're the only one I trust. Go get the bones. [tranquil music] - One of my men knows this girl. She is Constancia of Comlangan. - My name is Tannu. I am a Votadini. - You're no more Votadini than I am. You're a Wall Land girl. - Constancia of Comlangan was sent to the convent of the Five Duns. From there she was sent to the Culdee settlement of the Scots in the west. During the war, an Angle ship sought refuge in their harbour during a storm. Next day, Constancia disappeared. Abbess Monenna sent word to her parents that she had been abducted. - Were you abducted? - No. - She went of her own free will and enjoyed knowledge with Angle men. - The law proscribes that you be returned to the land from whence you came. They will decide what your punishment shall be. - I will perish! [sombre music] - Jesus, I pray for the everlasting happiness for your servant Regulus, and his companion Marcella, who have been taken to heaven from this place of bitter darkness. I pray for the return of the remains of Andrew who was the first to believe in you. I pray for the future of your bride Constancia who has sinned, but whose heart is good. Please, Jesus, forgive her. I pray for the will to outlive my new husband who does not love me. May you strike him dead with a thunderbolt if he tries to force himself upon me on this, my wedding night. What do you want? - I'm banishing you until your bastard child is dead! Move! - Where is she taking us? - To hell! [dramatic music] - I chased them up into the hills but I lost them. I saw a boat leaving the harbour. - The captured girl was a runaway nun. We sent her back to her convent. - I'm tired, Roderich. Someone else will have to track those Angles down. - I'll send a messenger to King Urien but we'll lose Saint Andrew to him if his men capture the Angles. - Can we go home, Papa? - We'll leave tomorrow. - Can we buy a bull? - I think so, have you still got the money? - I gave it to grandfather. - It's been hard earned. [gentle music] - I am sorry for the loss of our men. - They were brave men, Aedgar. You must compose a dirge for them. - What would I say in it, Rolf? I captured a woman, she wanted to marry me. If king Aethelric heard that, he'd have us killed. I must end my days here. You must return to the camp. - Then what? - Head back to Hexham with Hussa and tell them whilst on patrol, we were all killed. - I'm a poor storyteller, Aedgar. What will you do? - Go back for Hennini. - You are berserk. - I'm besmitten by her. I must win her back. - And I Tannu! - Tannu doesn't want you, Rolf. - They'll kill her, don't you care about her? - Of course I care about her, I've always cared about her. - Then we go together. We're brothers! [sombre music] - Father? - Yes, Ethne? - What will the nuns do to Tannu when she's returned to them? - Punish her. - Yes, but what will they do to her? - Make her eat bread and water for a month. I don't know. [gentle music] [upbeat music] - Ah, it's those bones again! - Let's just kill them and take their clothes. - Nay, nay, nay! These bones are worth a king's random to a Christian. - What are these? - [Luis] It's a knee bone, don't you see? Don't! [gentle music] - That's Monenna, she is the mother. - Be strong, Tannu! - How the mighty fall. It's a wicked world, a wicked world. - It's all mens doing. - It's all God's doing. Make no mistake, everything is God's doing. - Do you always repeat yourself? - You will be left on the rock until you learn some respect. Show me respect. [tranquil music] - Father, what does immuring mean? - Where did you here that? - I overhead Chief Cathen. He said that's what the nuns would do to Tannu and Lady Hennini. - Lady Hennini? - She was sent to the Culdees with Tannu-- - Down, Ethne! [upbeat music] You hide yourself here. If I'm not back before the sun goes over the hills, you head homeward. [upbeat music] [hollering] Don't get up! - What do you want? - He wants this dress back! - I'm not interested in the dress. It's them I'm after. - You can't have them, they're ours! - I'll pay you for them. - They're not for sale. - You're a Christian. What are these worth? - They are just old bones, they are worthless. - [Luis] Lying Angles! - I'll do the job for you! Here! Buy yourself a bullock cart to put your treasure on. Now clear your camp, I want to be alone when I do this. [drums beating] - I will seek revelation, please mother Monenna. - [Monenna] I will wait God's intervention. We shall leave you bread and light. If God wishes you to live, he will feed you. And give you the strength to repent. - My flesh is weak. I beg of you, for the love of Jesus, have mercy on me. [sombre music] - I'm giving you a fair chance, lads. - If you were a fair man, you'd untie our hands. - I'm not stupid, Angle. - How is Tannu, is she safe? - What do you care? - We rescued her.. When we found ourselves on the Culdee shore, we met Tannu. She hadn't seen a man in years and she took to me. When we put to sea we found her hidden under one the sails. Rolf who discovered her. She's been with us ever since. - You did her no favours. She has been sent back there with Hennini. - Hennini, what has she done wrong? - Like Tannu, she betrayed us by giving herself to one of you. - What is wrong with you people! Do you have so many women to spare that you can waste their lives? - Look, why don't we just get on with this. - No, I'm not playing this game. [grunting] Frig has blessed us! [sombre music] - I demand obedience here. We have a strict code of silence that only I am allowed to break at times of crisis. - Do I represent a crisis? - You represent everything I detest. Conceit, arrogance, vanity. Decadence, lustfulness. - And you represent selfishness, indulgence and power gone mad! How can you lead these women to waste their lives? It is madness! - We are light-bearers in a time of darkness. In us are invisible particles of light that are God. Only by stripping away the Devil's flesh that all of God reveal himself to us. If we do not try, and the flesh pulls us down, then God must intervene to redeem us. - God is not in us! I do not need to find out and discover who he is! I love him, and trust him. - Your body has trapped your light. Your shame is paraded in the way that you walk. Your hind as wanton as any seasoned animal. Your stance is that of prostitute, your breast that of a common whore, your mouth. You will obey me. - That's never going to happen. - Show her Constancia. - [Hennini] Tannu! - [Tannu] Hennini, is that you? Am I rescued? - [Hennini] Rescue will come, I am sure of it. - Aedgar will not come for me. - We must hope. - [Tannu] No one cares for me. - I care for you. - Why? - 'Cause we only have each other. - What have they planned for you? - I don't know yet. I have to go now, I will come whenever I can. Be strong, Tannu. [sombre music] [groaning] - I thought I told you to go home? - Aren't you glad I didn't? Where's your sword? - That was the Angles. - Have you still got the money for the bull? - No. - Who was it? The Angles or the Picts? - The Picts. - There's no point going home until you catch them, is there? - Ethne. - I'm not speaking to you until you get the money back. - [Fingal] Ethne! [suspenseful music] - [Hennini] Tannu. - [Tannu] Hennini? - Here. I'm going to get you out of here. - [Tannu] You'll be caught. - Do you want to be holed up until doomsday? - No. - You have intervened, spoiled all chance of this girl's redemption. Take her back to the rock! Shut her up for good this time. Let no light, no air enter. [gentle music] ♪ Oh God, you are my God ♪ And I long after you ♪ My soul is thirsting, aching ♪ And empty through - I am Tiree. The terrible tenacious tyrant. One of the trio. Centurian. Gladiator. I fought many battles, many campaigns. I was thrown into the arena to fight lions and hairy beasts! An overdue [mumbles] - The Romans left 150 years ago, what are ya talkin' about? - I'm just fame and fortune. [yelling] - [Beth] It's you again. - We don't want to fight with you, man. - Give up your weapons! I want my money back! Now the bones! - You can have them! Here. - Ethne! Take those. - And the money for the bull, father? From now on I look after the money in the family. - She's my daughter. Take the bones to Mungo the Dear One. - What will I tell him? - Tell him all you know. Thank you! - [Beth And Luis] I thought you were meant to be a warrior? - Cathen. [suspenseful music] [grunting] [metal clanking] [gurgling] Enjoy the view, old man. It's your last. [inspirational music] [grunting] - You have had time to reflect? - How can I reflect when I am half dead from the cold? - We have a right to protect our purity. Since you have been here, you have deflected us from our purpose. - I still don't see the purpose of living like this. You are all mad. Or have been driven mad by her. - I did not ask for you to be sent here. This is not a prison. Everyone in this room is here of their own free will. - Then send me back to the mainland. - We have discussed this, have we not? - Ay. - Our code may be strict but we are not without compassion. We recognise that you are a worldly woman. However, we believe that we can help you to find God within yourself. - I don't want to find God! I just want to be set free. - You are trapped by your body. Take her away, and undress her. You will put on the Craig and left there until your body is broken of its hold on your mind. [dramatic music] - Your master is dead on the rocks. - How so? - You tell me? He's been run through. - We've been visited by the Angles. - You are going to find me a boat, and carry me to the Culdees. [gentle music] - This is a sanctuary, be gone from here! - Remember me? - The shipman. - Shipman no more, where's the girl? - Lord you have answered our prayers. You have intervened to offer this child redemption. Hurry, make haste! Break down the wall! - Aedgar, Help me! Tannu. Tannu. - She is dead, Rolf. - Aedgar, she is alive. She's alive! Tannu. [tranquil music] [whimpering] [sombre music] - Here I erect a Mocking Pole. I turn this mockery towards King Urien and his councillors. I turn this head against towards the spirits of this land. So that they will wander astray, none reaching or finding his home till King Urien is driven from the land. - Aedgar? - No, Tannu. It is Rolf you must thank. - Rolf. - Tannu? Where is Hennini? I can't find her anywhere. - They have taken her to the Rock. - The rock? - You can see it from the headland. - I'm going to get her, Rolf. - The tide is against you. Aedgar. You have to wait till morning. [gentle music] Sit down, Aedgar. - Look at the weather! It's been like this for three days! - You shouldn't have made the curse until we were ready to leave. - You don't actually believe in all that do you? - That witch believed that your God intervened by sending us here. So why can't our Gods blow up a good storm? [laughing] [tranquil music] - The Mother kept a small coracle for her own use. - It will sink if you return with her in that. - Then I'll swim alongside her. It's a good job we Angles are men of the sea. [inspirational music] [water splashing] [waves crashing] [suspenseful music] [mumbles] - [Fingal] I'm [mumbles] away from here. - Do you still believe in duty over love? - [Fingal] Yes. - Then why have you come? - [Aedgar] Get away from her Celt! She belongs to me! - It is too late for me. - Hennini! [yelling] [metal clanking] Let me run the arrow. ♪ I have seen you in my sanctuary ♪ - Aedgar. - It's my last chance of adventure. - Take me with you. - To the other world? - Is there a spark of goodness in that world? - There's a bright burning flame. ♪ Oh Lord your love and guidance ♪ ♪ Are more than life can think ♪ I will rejoice and sing ♪ The shadow of your wing ♪ My soul it will be satisfied ♪ As a feast of bread just would ♪ ♪ And in your name I'll lift my hand ♪ ♪ And sing just to you ♪ My song it will be satisfied ♪ As a feast of bread just would ♪ ♪ And in your name I lift my hand ♪ ♪ And sing just for you [gentle music] - [Fingal] Hennini and Angle are dead. - No! I am the law on this land now! Put your weapons down. You owe me an honour. - Will he obey our Celtic laws? - If you accept me as one of you? - We are to wed and set up home here. - What about these women? - They are free to leave or stay. Rolf will repair our boat so we can come and go as we please. - So be it. I will let Roderich know. - From the holy man Mungo, free of charge. It's quite a gift. - Even better than a bull. [laughing] - What will Mungo do with Saint Andrew's bones? - Found an abbey with the Picts in the north and east. They are free of avarice, in the mean. - And where as people do we go from here? - Plough our fields, sow our seeds, and be grateful that we are alive.
