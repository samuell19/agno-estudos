Uncle Marcos citing Koran verses you must have lost it Because you are upset with him you want to make him a Muslim? - The other trouble is Sheikh Hassan - What is with him too? He's a Jew?

I know why he did it dad... The girl is in relation she has someone in mind If there was somebody else her father would have told us - But he refused immediately - He cannot say Why is that? Because she loves Imad Sheikh Hassan's son Imad, Sheikh Hassan's son? But she's Christian and he's Muslim Have you lost it? When uncle Marcos wanted a partner? Who did he choose? Didn't he choose Sheikh Hassan over you, dad? What you are saying in very serious Hani, don't inflame the matter Fine but time will prove me right - Come on, George - I'm ready, dad - I want to go with you to the Mass - Stay here, Matilda Me and George will pray for you I can't hear the call for prayer from here, Zinab Pray here at home and God will accept your prayer, Mahmud I miss praying in the Mosque and especially the morning prayer Don't let anybody see you Paul, God bless you Don't let anybody see you getting in the mosque God is the helper, Zinab - Good morning, Marcos - How are you, Sheikh Hassan? - Where are you going this early? - To pray - So are we - Go ahead then - Go ahead - You go ahead Go ahead, go ahead - Where will pray, Sheikh Hassan? - In the mosque - Yes, in which one? - I don't know, I'm still new here - Don't you know where the mosque is? - To the left at the end of this street - Fine, right, facing the church? - Yes So we're going the same way - Go ahead - Go ahead - Go ahead, Sheikh Hassan - Go ahead, Marcos - No, you go ahead - Go ahead - Go ahead, Sheikh Hassan - Go ahead - Go ahead, Sheik Hassan - You go ahead, we'll see each other - Let's go - Where?

Give them your okra, Um Imad Here is the okra My mother is merciless she makes great okra Please, there is nothing like my mother's mallow It was the reason I married Um Mary Her father invited me to lunch and once I reached out my hand to the plate and tasted it, I asked him "who made this great mallow?" He said, "My daughter" so I said "You daughter? Let's have an engagement" They were engaged they were engaged after the mallow - Engagement? - Yes You're laughing?
