Here you go. We're here partner. That's the ship "Machine Gun Kelly". Stop! Don't shoot at the helicopter. Okay, take it easy now. If you dare to move you'll end up spending a long time in jail, so be careful. "Welcome to our ship." I really wanted to say that. But we haven't invited you. Or should I say, you're not taught about basic manners. You don't have to show off in front of us, Andy-boy. Manner and that kind of things, are only used between good people. We have something urgent to do today. I'm Zenigata from Interpol. This is urgent. Excuse me, take a look at this: Sorry that I'm coming uninvited. I'm the well-known Lupin III. I don't know if you guys are aware, that this ship just looks like an ordinary ship. But in fact it's housing an illegal... casino, a gambling hole full of money. All of it owned by the Mafia. We also heard you make a lot of money at this place. Since you make so much money, you can't spend it all, right? So I'll help you spend the money. I'll come visit soon. Look forward to it. The cashier drops the money right into... the vault container through this pipe. The floor is closed off when the ship is on its trip. Every wall around the vault will be... guarded. There's no entrance or exit. They can only break through the wall, or wait until we arrive at a harbour. Even if it's the famous Lupin III, he... can't open a door that doesn't exist. It's impossible to steal the money. You are too naive! Everyone thinks like that, and they end up as a victim. For Lupin it's possible. What... What is... What is...? We're not here to film monster movies! Huh? That's weird, where's the pilot? What? I'll get you! What's the matter, partner? Where are you going? That pilot was Lupin! Lupin? Lupin III. Let's go. This way to the vault. Lupin III Alcatraz Connection. Guard room! Do you hear me? Lupin is here! Lupin and his gang have infiltrated. We've been discovered. Good work there, Pops. You're as good as ever. That's more than expected. Anyway, let's Leave him be. Let's Hurry. I want to see my favourite Mr. Lincoln. I like Kennedy better. I don't agree. The value of Kennedy's aren't as good as Lincoln's. So compared to Kennedy, I like Lincoln better. Don't really know which ones are better. Lincoln and Kennedy, both are money, right? What's the point to argue... What did you just say? Nothing, really. Goemon, I'm counting on you. Damn! Not even the guard room answers. Where have you been? I was lost. Forget it. We'd better protect the vault. Lincoln is the best after all. I'll leave the rest to you. It should be our turn, Lupin. Lupin, what are you doing? Nothing... Are you having some good ideas? You know me. You'd better meet up with us, before... that scary Old Man comes back. My, my. I didn't think of the chance of other... people apart from us being here. Who are they? Okay then. Time to get the getaway plan ready. Don't let it get away! Shoot, shoot! How long will it take to destroy that monster?! Huh? Could it be...? That helicopter shouldn't... That's Lupin. Not just in the helicopter, I think they're down there as well. What should we do? Thanks for your hard work. You've gone too far. - Why are we the only ones working? - I was busy with something. Let's go, Jigen. Lupin! What should we do? He's taking all the money! I know that! First of all... Huh? Uuh? Huh, that's... This was done by Lupin. He just wanted to distract our attention. That bastard. What? What? Didn't you say that the monster would last longer? How should I know? I didn't expect Pops to be so smart this time. Lupin. I've had enough with you in the last century. I don't want to continue this century as well. Not bad, Pops. You had the advantage this time. But I'll be fully prepared, and get my revenge next time! Bye Bye! You're not bad, partner. My partner will not take things like that. Got it partner? A good policeman will not do that. Pfft, give it back. Does it matter? I just got myself some tips. Damn it! Just like we've already said, we didn't get the master-thief Lupin III, or his partners. But because of the hard work of these two policemen, we saved the ship, and all passengers are safe. We will show the rest of America our competence. In this situation, I think that we... should use the words that Kennedy spoke. "Ask not what your country can do for you." "Ask what you can do for your country." That's the most appropriate, in this kind of situation. Inspector Zenigata from Interpol will... handle this mission, together... with Inspector Terry Crown, who will help him accomplish the task. We wont forget your bravery. Yes, I'll prove that if I get elected as... the next president of this great country. Whatever he says. But wasn't that ship burnt out yesterday? They made use of that fire, to destroy all the evidence. Now we can't even investigate. Shit, that's too bad. Everyone please follow me! Let's create a new future! This moment will be engraved into history forever! What are you saying? All the data was destroyed? Then... Lupin... is the only one that has the information now. Right. I understand. Understand? Give me back my two months! Two months! I've spent two months with all kinds... of preparations. All wasted now! It's okay, what's the difference... You've earned two months worth off pay in the casino. How dare you say things like that?! A woman's two months time is more valuable than men's! I want those two months back! I might have found a good lover, or I might have married someone! Isn't it enough to get a baby? Shut up, will you! Lupin, you'd better tell them. What? What you did in the guard room. I think thats's what you really wanted. You're really my good partner. You know me so well. You cheated me again! You'd better hurry up and tell me what's going on! I will, I will. A map of the seabead of San Francisco. Why did they make this kind of map? This is what we came here for. If this is something related to a treasure, hurry it up! You're so unpatient, Fujiko-chan. Let's see here... So this ship is divided into two parts. The upper part looks like an ordinary ship. But is in fact a money laundry facility for the mafia. The other part is secretly investigating the underwater world of San Francisco. Of course they're doing this to make more money. This is what our purpose here is. Taking the money from the casino as we were passing by. What? What do you mean "passing by"? You let me work in the casino for two months! Don't be so stingy, Fujiko-chan. If the value of the treasure is worth more than your... two months working time, You'll be happy, right? Really? You should've told me earlier. Then everything will be fine. Tell me the truth. What do you want to know? Mmmm? The beauty who sleeps under the sea, and about the shiny gold? Gold!? I like gold! I like gold the most! You like gold better than me? If you let me get the treasure, I'll like you more. Really... The water in this sea is very cold. The weather is not stable either. Just like you, Fujiko. What do you mean? Since a long time ago, ships got wrecked here often, and sank to the bottom. There are many wrecks just laying at the bottom of the sea. We have the same target as those people at the casino. I want to find a big ship which had an accident in 1854. Yankee Blade. They had to fill up most of the storage rooms, to fit all the gold. According to the calculation nowadays, that would be equivalent to the yearly budget of a small country. But, that famous ship, should've been discovered already, by some experts, right? Regarding that... Because that ship sunk to about 6000m under the surface, and due to the high speed of the current, it's not been discovered until recently. How's that? That's not a bad plan. Huh, Fujiko-chan, have you gained weight recently? Ouch, ouch... I can keep my diet forever. Anyway. I got this info when I got onto the ship. This is a good bonus. The mafia have been working hard recently. So? You want to join? Of course. It's been my dream to become a pirate. Goemon! Aren't you interested in finding treasures? No, I am. Let me join you. To live, money is necessary. What did you say? How come, Goemon-chan. I finally understand that. In order to live on, money is necessary. That is called understanding. "Is it going to snow tomorrow." Whatever you say. I already know it. To live you must have money. How about it. Where should we start? Well, we have to start by analyzing. The mafia are still investigating, so that means... They can't confirm where the ship was sunk. Or they have the position confirmed already, but something is stopping them from taking further action. He's the candidate for the presidency? What kind of parade is this? It's been like this all the time, right? Can he win? Once you become one of the candidates, all it takes is to spend enough money. So they'll give up on that ship? Possible. What about Lupin? Do you have any clues? With the help from the police force, I found ten suspicious locations. According to my sixth sense, I'd say he'll be here or here. Where are you going? Sorry, I got a bit thirsty from the food. I'll get something to drink. Sorry. Is this it? Don't rush it. Bingo! But what shall we do? Lupin. The treasure is 6000m under the surface. That's somewhat a problem, isn't it. There aren't many submarines that can reach that depth. What? Then we should steal a submarine that can. What's this? Man... That's why I don't like the mafia at all. They're really impolite. Quick, everyone get out! Aaaaargh, I'm going to die! Just kidding! Is it necessary to exaggerate like that? Really... It's a burden to play games with those simpleminded guys. We've been well-behaved recently. Lupin-kun. Oopsie-daisy. Don't try anything with me. The mafia really do have too much free time. It's just a broken ship. Why spend so much money on it? No matter what or where the party is, we'll be interested anyway. That's our motto. Even if our opponent is just a young amateur thief. Young amateur thief?! That's right. And If someone tries anything stupid, we'll get back twice as hard. Bastard! What's going on here? Has there been a war here? Lupin! Hey, what's wrong? What? The mafia, and even Zenigata are here. It's crowded here today. Huh, Pops is here to? Lupin! Lupin. Tell us how to use the data! The data about the treasure! Think about Lupin first! Worry about the data later! No. I care more about the treasure. What's this? Thats our Lupin! He left the info about the treasure behind, on this memory card. Then, as long as we have this... Yes, we can go for the treasure. Thank you, Lupin. We'll carry your dream on. You two... He suddenly has a job. He wants to be the king of the world, so he must be trying hard. As expected, Lupin really knows about the treasure. Even if he knows, he can't do anything about it. He can't dive down 6000m to the bottom, and steal the gold. You're right! Even if he did steal the info, nothing will happen. Boss, please forgive me. I didn't mean to underestimate the matter regarding Lupin's theft of the information. Please forgive me. I will not fail. Let me take over his position. The next one to die will be Lupin. We need to hurry up. Let me handle this. I'll be the one to kill that man. I'm looking forward to it. Everything is prepared, for our eternal paradise. Will you handle the interrogation? Having fun? Let's see how good you can handle this. The data that you stole, where is it? If you let me go, I'll think about telling you. You'd better start talking about the right things, prisoner. You'd better not make him mad. He has a tendency of making people talk, he's a real sadist. Then we should be a perfect match. I like torturing people. But being tortured, I would like the... person torturing me to be a cute girl. What? What's that? No! I'm scared of the dark! Stop it, stop it! Shut it. You're annoying. Do you want to know what I'm going to do to you next? I don't have a good feeling about this. Don't say that already... I want to let you know! We're just getting started! This is what I like to do! Don't overdo it. I'll be gentle with you, and let you... know how fun this game really is. I believe you'll start talking eventually. Are you feeling good now? This jazz music is the best. When did you put the headphones on? That's what I'd like to call a business secret. This pisses me off! OK, I'll raise the bar a notch! This cobra is extremely poisonous. You're worse than the snake. If you get bitten, you'll die within 30... seconds, if you don't get this antidote. You can go to hell, together with this mouse. Let's see here... Don't come! Don't come any closer! I'm telling you! Stop! Stop! Aaaargh! Please! Don't! Got it?! Help... Now, tell us where the data is. Enough, take it off, hurry! 15 seconds left. 10 seconds left. It hurts. 6 seconds. 4, 3, 2, Can you still stand, Lupin? But you should know by now how bad I can be. If you don't want to die, you'd better... See? Because you didn't take the helmet off... in time, I took a bite of your cobra. Enough! I wont forgive you this time! Where the hell did that thing come from?! It belongs to this room. Really? This is your last chance. If you don't tell us, you'll go flying high in the sky. What's so scary by flying into the sky? Really? I'll give you one more chance. Spill it! Where's the data? You're so annoying! But, since you want to know so badly, I'll tell you. Where? I've given it to someone. Who? That's my Jigen-chan! You rescue me whenever I'm in danger. It should be my turn now. Didn't I just say I prefer torturing someone more than beeing tortured by someone? Too bad that the opponent isn't a cute girl. Bye bye. Fire. Or? Now that the tables have turned, now it's your turn to talk. It's useless. This Haiena would rather die, than speak a word. Are you friends? We know each other. That's why, Jigen Daisuke, you should not forget... I'm not easy to deal with. Look. We'll take care of the grudge between us next time. Bye! That's a really annoying bastard. Haiena, if he's getting involved, this case is getting difficult... What's this, partner? It's already difficult anyway. But, how did you find me? The memory card you left behind. This location was stored on it's GPS. What about Fujiko and Goemon? They think the gold is more important. I see. Huh? This is? Alcatraz. Right. Al Capone, Machine-Gun Kelly and other serial killers... This used to be the place to keep those horrible persons locked up. This is the most secure prison. The Rock. But it's a tourist attraction now. Thanks. The treasure of the wreck, the mafia, and The Rock. No one can escape from this island. Alcatraz. What are they trying to do here? The Chinese mafia... What are you doing? That's mine! Haven't you been eating my rice? You bastard, the fried rice belongs to me! My egg white! What's the difference? I haven't eaten a thing for 48 hours. Anyway, I never thought that Al Capone... were related to the chinese mafia. What does that mean? Even Al Capone and the chinese mafia were allied with each other. Those kind of things really interest me. Give me a mouthful too! No way! I'll ask you one thing... Have you heard of the Secret 7 group? Yeah. They're really famous on the west coast. It's a crime organization, but no one knows who the members are. Lupin, could it be? Yeah, you're right. That Howan guy must be one of the members. I see. Haiena were connected as well. You bastard. Then Marukano, Howan, and Haiena must be three of the members. Don't you think this is weird? What? That the Secret 7 group wants that treasure at the bottom of the sea. Isn't that romantic? I don't understand that at all. But Fujiko and Goemon are so cold, not coming to rescue me. I would've risked my life for them. Fujiko-chan is that kind of person. But what about Goemon? He shouldn't be obsessed with money. He said he had things to do. Things to do? He couldn't be looking for girls, right? Really, that guy... Hello? Ah, Monica! I haven't heard your voice for a long time. Really, what have you been up to... Woman eh. Got it! Great! This is good! Sexier! Suzan. That's perfect, perfect! You're the best, Suzan! OK! Change background. Goemon? Goemon... Hey, Goemon! I need to rest. Sorry, I'm really sorry. Do you want a cup of coffee? Yes, please. Thanks. As a samurai this must be hard to do. I can't earn much in this industry. Don't say things like that. I think you'll become really famous. Just believe in yourself. Thanks. But if you want to become a super model... I understand. Give me some more time. I'll make you famous. I'll think of a way. Goemon. I'll handle everything, for sure. Goemon. I'm turning into a cow. Don't be like that, Monica. I'll get things done shortly. Yes, yes. I promise, OK? But don't forget what you promised me. You two, don't get any closer. Even If I don't know who you are, before you have the chance to shoot I'll make 2 holes in your chests. No, 3 holes to be correct. Who the hell are they? I don't know, CIA or FBI maybe. What? Because their suits are so nice. Jigen, let's go catch the tram-car. Any problem? No problem. If you want money, go rob a bank. There's only coins here. Sorry about that. Do you mind getting off? You see, you get chased. Look at me, cutting the wire. What? Lupin derailed a tram-car?! He's on his way to the center of the town. All the available forces get there immediately. Understood. Aren't we catching Fujiko first? Catching Lupin is priority one. Why are you opening the door? You go get Lupin yourself. I'll go and investigate Fujiko, OK? Hey! Really. What's going on? Another woman? No, no, no. The seed I planted earlier, it's growing now. Seed? Straight forward. Isn't this the election center? Things are getting interesting. Don't enjoy it all by yourself. Tell me what's going on. I wanted to know where all the money from the casino were going, so I left a sender with it. In the last minute, that sender released... a tracable electric wave liquid. Wait, you mean that some of the money... from the casino went to the mayor? Bingo! The mayor is also a member of the Secret 7 group. What, the mayor is going for president... in the next election, right? That's why he needs so much money. The... first president from the confederacy. They're great. They've got it all planned. It's a shame that it's so easy to figure it out though. That Old bastard again! He should be thinking more of his age. He's not bad for his age, though. Ready, aim! Uh oh. So many cops with guns... Fire! That Old Man really wants to learn how to do things the American way. Jigen, hurry, think of a solution. OK. It's fun. It's been a long time since I've been so excited! Look, a black one! I prefer purple. It's really in there! We're back on the street again! You want a good woman like me to get electrocuted? What do you mean by a good woman? That kind of women does everything men tells them to do. I don't think you're that type. Is that so? Then please tell me, where's the thing that Lupin stole? Right on! Can you make a right at the next street? This isn't a taxi. You're no fun. Forget it, I'll do it myself. Now you're in a pinch. Tell me where the info is hidden. How should I know? I broke up with Lupin. Ans the casino heist was a failure. I've said this before... What does it mean to be a good woman? A good woman... A good woman can take care of herself. You're not one of them though, Fujiko. I see... A good woman... Is honest and stupid. What's this car doing here in the way? Move, hurry it up! Don't underestimate me! Pops... Think about your age, don't strain yourself. If you're thinking about my age, why aren't you doing as I say? You're too old. Don't be like that. Good timing! Let's go! What? It's not over yet! Thanks, driver-chan. The fifth member? Two more members to find. It's quite efficient, this. I want to celebrate with you, but this isn't a good time... Why? Why did you drive the tram-car straight through a wall? That way it'll stop right in front of Fujiko's bathroom. Fujiko, are you finished yet? Lupin. Things aren't as calm as you'd think. Why's that? Could it be...? Someone took Fujiko and the data. Stop right there! Alright, hands in the air. Pops, you try too hard. I'm just gonna take you two back to the... station, then I can take a long vacation. Shit, Fujiko got away. You got Lupin? That's great. Didn't take long to find the bastard. What? I won't let you get away. Lupin. I finally got you, Lupin. What are you doing? Stop! Even if you catch him, he'll just escape. It'll be a disaster. Is this how you work? Bastard! Okay. But If he escapes, it would be real bad. Love life. Ishikawa Goemon XIII, a generation of blue blood. Love always come at a high price. Maybe, but that woman costs a lot. In order live a life of luxury with that woman, you'd need a lot of money. What do you want? You're not here to convince me to break up with her, are you? Not really. I won't stop you from taking the difficult path of love. I just wanted to ask you, has Fujiko contacted you? No. What about it? Pops partner, that Inspector... chased her, but it seems she got away. There's no trace of her. Could it be...? She's not thinking of keeping the treasure all to herself is she? She's the type though... Why aren't you asking about Lupins whereabouts? Really. The way things have turned out, you'd be surprised. Jigen! I'm waiting for Lupin to escape, and for you to meet up with us. Until then, carry on with your good life. Yes, the Lupin problem is up to you now. Leave the remaining two persons to me. Lupin by himself cannot achieve much. Got it. If anyone's getting in our way, and is an obstacle to our grand scheme. They'll be removed, one by one. No matter who it is. What's this? Why didn't I make it to the front page? The murder weapon was a Derringer? It's unusual that anyone dared to kill off a big mafia boss. Moreover, this Old Man was a member of the Secret 7 group. What do you think Pops? Pops! I'm talking to you! What is it? Really... That daylight dynamism of yours, where is it now? During the day you're like the ultimate police, Dirty Harry. Every time I get cought by you, you always get restless right away. Therefore I'm not going to let you catch me any more. You're truly optimistic. That's my basic instinct, because you are my adversary. Huh? The one who's been devoting his life, to arrest me, has always been you Pops. That's why I keep going like this. I'm telling the truth. Lupin. What you just said has touched me from the bottom of my heart. You're so vulnerable Pops. Here you go. Where did you get his handkerchief? Thank's for your hard work. You're... I knew you were a member of the Secret 7 group. Oopsie-daisy. Don't make any rash moves. You know, I only need to shout for help, and the... guards will rush over here and shoot you on sight. Do you know who I am? If all you want is to rob the ship's casino of... the money, I can still grant you a reprieve. It's ok... It's because of my excessive greed, that... I've gotten into this line of business. If one's greed is excessive, it may lead to a premature death. Rukino Marukano was killed by you, wasn't he? A guy who can't achieve anyhing, doesn't deserve to keep on living. Wasn't he a big boss of the mafia? Could it be that you're the leader of the Secret 7 group... You truly are the worlds' No. 1 eccentric thief. Apparently your IQ isn't bad either. You senseless fellow! Game Over. Inspector, what happened? What was that noise just now? Come quickly! What's wrong? Inspector? Lupin committed suicide! What did you say?! Call an ambulance! Hurry! Yes sir! When I got near his cell, I saw him take out a hidden gun. A Derringer. Then he shot himself in the head. I guess he must've been unable to stand it, loosing his pride like that, getting caught. Terry. Would you mind leaving the two of us alone for a while? Huh? The mission of my life has been to arrest Lupin. I want to say goodbye to him in my own way. OK. Take your time saying your goodbyes. Why are you pretending to be dead? You deserve the fame Pops, you understand me. And you're even getting me involved in it. What's the big idea? Don't talk so loud, or he'll see right through this charade. He? Inspector Terry. He's probably watching us through the surveilance system. Raise the volume. There's no mic in there. Why not? Corpses usually doesn't talk. What are you saying? Terry is... Lower your voice a bit, Pops. Yes, he's the leader of America's biggest underworld organisation, the Secret 7 group. You have any proof? Our every move has been leaked. Not only you Pops, but the mafia are also chasing after us. That's why I suspect that Terry is a member of the Secret 7 group. First Fujiko disappeared, and my place have been trashed. I knew they would come after me again, so I prepared myself. He turned up in the middle of the night. I grabbed his gun, and swapped the bullet, in his Derringer. Then I made good use of my skills of disguise, and splattered a bag of blood all over the place. Just think about it. It's because he's... one of the Secret 7 group members, he had the chance to kill the godfather... of the mafia at close range. Due to this, Terry must be the boss of the Secret 7 group. Damn it. So it's all his doing! Pops, calm down a bit. The surveilance system! The surveilance! Damn it! Does this mean that even after being fooled, there's nothing I can do about it? Not really. When the opportunity comes, I'll help you get even. I'm not interested in cooperating with a thief. Stubborn as usual. Are you really going to let a member of that group become the president of the USA? After finishing off this Terry case, I'm still going to arrest you. OK. You're welcome to try. Why go through the trouble of sending him back to Japan? Just find a spot here and bury him. He was my only true enemy. I must follow the Japanese burial tradition. I've made all the arrangements with the airport authority. Take care. See ya, partner. Is it alright now? Can I come out? It seems the coast is clear. I was bored to death. What's up, Pops? Your face... get rid of it right away! It's not bad, really. With my skills in disguise, I should have no problem getting an Oscar award. I'm dead tired. I've got cramps all over, from hiding in there. I hope I can find some time for a hot spring... bath, and a body massage to go with it. Lupin... Regarding Terry's crimes, I already have a rough idea. But there's still one thing I don't understand. Why must Terry kill you? I'm not sure about that either. What's the objective of the Secret 7 group? How should I know? Those two mysterious people in black who kept chasing you... Who are they? I can't quite recall that either. You, be a little more serious please. Look out! Look out! Stupid fuck! I see... If you don't spill it right now... Why did you do that, Pops? For your sake I've come all the way to San Francisco. Lupin! Calm down. What are you doing? A bomb? Yes, drive faster. That fellow Terry, must be hiding somewhere watching our every move. Maybe from up there in the helicopter. That's probably it... It's only 60 seconds left to heaven. We can't involve innocent citizens. Turn right! Who's driving, you or me? No time for that now! Turn right. Let's go partner, good luck to you Pops! Lupin! Let's go! To The Rock. What stupid fool was driving that car? Really... Who knows? Lupin. Terry! Grrr! You look fine, Terry-boy. Please don't call me that any more, old man. No matter how old you grow, you'll always be my Terry-boy. When the old boss still were alive, it really was our golden era. But Kennedy put a stop to our paradise. That was why he needed to die, both John and Robert were the same. I've been waiting for you to restore The Rock, to its former state as a paradise, Terry-boy. I hope that it'll happen before I finally... close my eyes for the last time. What's Suzan doing? She's still busy wiping out Lupin's partners. And the data? Fujiko had analyzed most of it. The rest is up to our submarine. It all depends on wheter it can withstand... the pressure from the 6000 meters depth. You're a new member here. No wonder you don't know about it, Andy. In order to assure that our plan succeeds, I've spent ten years researching and developing a submarine. 6000 meters is nothing. Even a depth of 10000 meters is ok. It'll still withstand it, boss. The day our dreams come true will soon be at hand. Lupin and his gang that were trying to halt... our progress, have been taken care off. Those regarded as criminals by the society, our mentors that were once seated here, made this island into our own paradise. This glorious place, The Rock, will... become the base to realize our ambition. We will make the whole world into our paradise. A paradise that respects us! These things are very common. The simpler the man, the easier it is... for him to be deceived by a woman. Anyway, how come you suspected her? Because she was a good woman. So good it had to be unreal. That's usually how it is... Hey, this isn't part of the tourist attraction. Mr. Japanese. Is that so? I'm here to investigate a case. Have you seen a person that came here... on this helicopter, an Inspector Terry? I don't recognize anyone like that. Apart from sightseeing tourists, no one comes here. You're late. You've memorized the controls, haven't you, Fujiko? Of course, doctor. My first speciality is to manipulate men, my... second speciality are machines like this. I never thought you would help us. Someone asked me if I wanted to die, or... look for treasures on the ocean floor. And with a 10% reward, there's no need to think twice. Hey, if Lupin would hear about this, wouldn't it break his heart? It's OK. I usually end up breaking it anyway. That's right! Didn't you say that there were problems... controlling it in certain situations? I've improved the controls. Let me show you. Why didn't you kill Fujiko right away? That Old Man has no self-confidence. He's afraid. He's afraid of safety problems with the submarine. If the sub would fail to return, the... only one to die would be Fujiko. If the gold bars are successfully retrieved, Fujiko would still be disposed of afterwards. Typically his style. Smart, but still very cautious. The depths of his schemes can be said... to be the greatest in the world. May I ask you something? As long as there's money, can Max really become president? With this much money, we can buy a lot of votes. But this nation's rights aren't just limited to that. The military and the CIA. Yes. No need to worry. It's not difficult to deceive them. As long as there's money... It'll be alright. It truly is the most secure prison in the entire USA. If Lupin gets locked up in a place like this, I guess he'll be unable to cause any more trouble. Huh? Alright! Everybody follow me. This is the last part of the tour. The unbreachable jail cells. I'm really lucky. This prison was built in 1912. In 1963, attorney general Robert F. Kennedy, ordered to close it down. There were 1576 crime convicts serving sentences here. Al Capone and Machine-Gun Kelly were here, both of them were big leaders of the mafia. Let me test your knowledge. In 1963 when this prison was closed, what major event took place? The year 1963? I remember back then, a bowl of ramen used to cost 30 yen. 1963 must to be the year when President... John F. Kennedy was assassinated. That's right. In other words, in the year JFK was assassinated, Robert F. Kennedy ordered the closure of this prison. But 5 years later Robert Kennedy also got assassinated. OK, let's move on. I see. That young man's voice... Lupin! What do you want? Oh yeah, Lupin died in that explosion... Could I be misstaken? Or is it because of my old age? I'm sorry for what I did just now. Don't mention it. I knew it was you, Lupin! This voice converter was of really poor quality. Lupin, so you're alive! Playing dead or remaining under arrest, naturally I chose to play dead. But I'm really busy now. See ya, Pops! Lupin don't run! We'll control the sub from here, all... the way to the location of the wreck. Your only responsibility is get the discovered gold bars salvaged. I know, my genius doctor. Don't you forget my share! Lupin, where are you? Isn't that the mayor in Terry's helicopter? Max, you must get elected for president, and restore the paradise here. I'm counting on you. Nooooooooo! Paradise... What's all this about? It's too cruel. Lupin! Pops, gotta run. See ya! Wait, Lupin, what did you say just now? Explain it to me clearly! Suzan. Why are you so eager to go to Alcatraz? Is there anything special you need to do there? Yes, it's my job. My job is to send you and your friend to hell! Suzan! After all, I was right about you. You really are the last member of the Secret 7 group. Thank you, Goemon. You really helped us out. Because of you, we managed to wipe out our biggest enemy, Lupin III. And thank you for getting us the intelligence, which helped us get rid of you one by one. The two of you are the only ones left. I'll send you to where your partners are. What's so funny? It's too bad. We won't die that easy. Not Lupin either. We're all the same. Haiena! Haiena! Suzan! Now in the end, I want to ask you something. Your love for me, has it been true? The truth can't be expressed in words. This is the truth! Die! You're just as usual. Trying to act cool. That's what I hate most! If you're frustrated now, you should've improved your skills before coming. What my sword shall slay will not be a beautiful woman, but an evil soul! Hey! Are you done playing around? Hurry over here! Wait Lupin! Wait Lupin! Thank you, guys! What are we going to do next? Come over to my prison cell. What's Lupin trying to do anyway? So, under the cell there's another room. This is... I've finally found it. Lupin, what's this? The Underground Alcatraz. Underground Alcatraz? Does this look like a prison? No, on the contrary, it looks like a... New York street a few decades ago. People outside thought that this was... a prison for hardened criminals. When in fact, this was the paradise for those criminals. It was also where the criminals and prison wardens, and even the prison chief, became allies. It was their heaven. This was their America. I see. I thought there was something fishy about... those big gangsters beeing unable to escape, when this prison is only two kilometres from San Francisco. Yeah, the real reason is they didn't... want to leave this so called paradise. This was their safe haven. However, two brothers who knew this secret, appeared. You mean John F Kennedy, and Robert Kennedy? Yes. In 1963, Robert Kennedy discovered this secret, and decided to close this prison. The mafia was naturally very unhappy... about it since this was their paradise. They decided to take matters into their own hands. On November 22nd that year, JFK was assassinated. Robert Kennedy resigned as attorney. However, five years later when electioneering for presidency... I see, the assassination of the Kennedy brothers was caused by the Alcatraz situation. Not only were the mafia involved, the CIA and the FBI were also in on it. The Kennedy brothers could be said to have... gotten in the way of some hard-to-tackle people. The biggest assassination riddle of the 20th century. Wait a moment. The Secret 7 group treats this as their secret base, because... Correct, because they're all the offspring of those old criminals. Terry, Haiena, Suzan, all of them are. No wonder I once heard Haiena mention... that he would fight for paradise. Truly a cool fellow. It feels good to be in here. Have you spotted the target? Wait a moment. I see it now. From here on, I'll leave the controls to you. Start the C-sensor now. Understood. C-sensor? What was that? I got a bad feeling about this. Fujiko, start with what's in front of you. Even if you find just one piece of gold, it won't matter. Don't joke around! Gold bars, I'll take all of you back home! What's this C-sensor? Why haven't I heard of it before? I'm sorry, I took the liberty of fitting it myself. I enhanced the submarine's operating... capabilities, with some CIA equipment. What's this place? Really, could Lupin be lost in here as well? Hey, excuse me Mister! Hey! What are you doing here?! What's that? It's that guy! What? Someone is inside. Intruders have infiltrated. What? Ariji, I'll leave the rest to you. Where are they? You can't let them escape. There's something wrong, come back right away Fujiko. Let's see here. Hey, Fujiko. Don't be so greedy, think about the consequences. Oh, Lupin, so you're still alive? If you have time to worry about me, you'd better worry about yourself. It looks like you only have a few minutes left. If we would see the beautiful Fujiko, compressed into a small... heap, I guess many of the fans would cry their hearts out. I guess that's right. But to get back to automatic control, you need to change the settings over there. Therefore... Someone save me! That fellow who likes to show off should have said so earlier. We must go now, Lupin. Where are you going? I must do something first. But what if I'm already dead by the time you get back? In that case, I'll make some offerings at your grave. Right, right. Let's lighten the weight of the sub. What do you mean? There must be things we can jettison. I'll wait for you up there. What are you doing? Boss! This is how you do it! They want to destroy our paradise again. What a pity that we can no longer keep hiding this secret. Boss, how did they find out about this place? Let me tell you. Lupin, so you're alive after all. My main interest is to disappoint others. And in that fellow's grasp is a treasure, capable of covering the whole world. That incident 38 years ago. 38 years ago? The year 1963... JFK? Say no more, Lupin. Bingo. 38 years ago in Dallas. The assassination of President Kennedy. 10 hours after the assassination, They shot the suspect Oswald. The truth was thus covered up. But it didn't go as smooth as expected. Some residents at the assassination scene, covered the event with a home camera. The film became an important piece of evidence for the assassination. And there was also a bullet. Evidence exhibit No. 399. Which was what Oswald supposedly fired. Correct, but there was just a single bullet. And that couldn't have achieved the... inexplicable course the bullet took. Scientifically, it was impossible to explain. That suggested there must've been someone shooting from another location at the same time. But in that case... In other words, the publicly disclosed evidence has been faked. Faked? You really have investigated things thoroughly. Isn't it because of that you must ensure my elimination? Not only you, but the kid over there as well? Yes, I don't want too many people to know the truth about this case. In other words, you guys just have to die! Look out! Machine-Gun Kelly, here I go! Gunshots? That was really close. Hold it right there! CIA? Hey, wait! Wait! Oh, what's happening now? Gold bars, my gold bars! If you knew that the official evidence had been faked, where's the real evidence? Could it be that...? Bingo! It is now hidden among the gold bars on the ship Yankee Blade. You're too slow, Terry. Could it be that you and your partners... have thought of some other tricks? You could say that. But I'm still not clear about one thing... How did you come to know that the... evidence is hidden among the gold bars? It's very simple. I used to have close friends in the military, which proved useful. The person who deliberately sank the gold... bar to the bottom, was the ruler here. In other words, it was my father's idea to sink... the evidence at the same spot as Yankee Blade. I see. Since all questions are answered, let's make a deal. The gold bars are all yours. But the evidence of the Kennedy assassination, is mine. It's not a bad deal, Lupin. OK Is what I would like to say. But even more I'd like the evidence of the assassination. What? I have no patience to wait till the year 2039. The year 2039? The century memorial of the Kennedy assassination? Correct. By that time all the people involved would be dead, so it would be possible to go public with the truth. But I have no patience to wait until then. This means that the deal is off. Why did you turn the offer down, Lupin? Because I wasn't sure about it. Really! >_ Even if I die in here, I'll seek out Lupin for revenge. 26 pieces. 27 pieces. 28 pieces. 29 pieces. Stop it! I won't let you get away. Goemon, Such a dangerous fellow. Do something about him. I don't want to use my sword at this time. Why? Because he killed his woman with it. Is that so? My suit is not cheap. More bullets doesn't necessarily mean victory. Andy! Terry! Terry, you bastard! You have the nerve to fool me! You dare to pose as a police Inspector... Good timing Pops... Quickly now. Stop it! My paradise... I shouldn't end like this. Pops is really working hard. My big love Fujiko finally showed up to save us. Wait! Terry, you're under arrest! Pops! Pops! Don't come any closer. One step closer and the old guy dies. Don't mind me. Shoot him, Lupin. How can I shoot like this? As an Inspector myself, I surely can't forgive someone like him. You can't let him get away. Don't give me your macho talk, Zenigata. You're also afraid of dying. So, now, ask Lupin to throw the gun away. Hurry! For a moment, you were my partner. Still... you can't understand my character? What? Aim at me and Terry! Shoot through my heart, and Terry will get hit too! Pops... I'm sorry, Lupin. Don't do it! It would've been good if you hadn't been my partner back then, Terry. That way I would't feel so guilty shooting you. How frustrating. I've had enough! Oh, let's go. Pops, I've honoured my promise. Lupin! What's this about, Lupin? It's ok. Let's get in. Don't! It's crowded inside. Stop talking, get in. This place is falling apart. Pops, hurry out. Take care, Pops. Take care? Hey, Lupin... Good luck. Work hard to escape. Wait for me, Lupin! Just you watch me! The Rock. A past that can't be brought to light. It's become history now. After all the hard work and time spent, in the end only one piece is left. That's too bad. Because this isn't even real gold. You're lying! It's the truth of the Kennedy assassinations. Yes, this is what the whole America tried... to get a hold of, to solve the mystery. This thing can't be exchanged for money. Lupin, you're under arrest! Mermaid? No it's Pops! Old Man is truly a shadow that refuses to go away. Wait, what mermaid are you talking about? Really, where did Lupin go? Who knows. What were my past few months for? Lupin wasted the most precious youth of a woman. I'm going to sue him! I want compensation! Do as you please. You're joking, aren't you? I risked my life to find this. Didn't you say you wanted to write about the truth of... the Kennedy assassinations, as your graduation essay? And then go to bed with me... I mean fall in love with me? But, I changed my mind. Monica, this old man has gone through a lot of trouble. Whether I graduate or not doesn't matter any more. I've found my long-term care provider. Goodbye then! You're better off sound asleep in the sea, until the arrival of the year 2039! THE END
