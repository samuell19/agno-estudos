It's hail and farewell, young Davey. A drink from your pond, a kiss from your beautiful mother and I'm on my way. She... Ma ain't here. That's why the wash hangs out all night, eh? Where is she? She was sick a while. A good while for her to have her let the apples ripen on the tree for bird food. And then she... then she died. And your pa? What about your pa? He's been sittin' up there just sittin' for I don't know how long. Won't eat, won't move and won't talk. Maybe, uh... Maybe him and you better strike out up north with me for a winter of huntin'. Jim, you mean it, huh? You mean it? Well, now... Here, you take the rest of these clothes in. I'll go up and talk to your pa. You mind if I say a few words, Big Davey? I reckon you loved her too in your own way. I never reckoned I'd be as miserable as I was the day you won her. But now you lost her. She always thought to be buried in a proper graveyard. Church singin' and flowers. Leave! Go! What'd he say? These weeds around here grows as fast as... weeds. You ought to clear 'em out, they'll smother your mother's flower bed here. You mean, we ain't goin' with you? Now, young Davey, you wouldn't wanna grow up wild and woodsy, like a weed, would you? Weeds grow faster than flowers and tougher too. Susan was always afraid her kids would grow up woodsy. I reckon that's why she decided on your pa instead of me. I wouldn't want to go and change that. So I'll be back in the spring, young Davey. You take care of your pa until then. Bye, Jim. Goodbye, Davey. ♪ And I'll be there in... ♪ Pa, how long you gonna carry on this way? Davey, it looks to me like you ain't put soap and water to your face in a week. I reckon I could stand a shave myself. "Births and Deaths." Back East kin folk gather around for funeral doings. You wouldn't know, Davey, but it makes the heart a lot easier. Jim says, "Why don't we all strike out North? For a winter of huntin', maybe." Davey, this is no time to go huntin'. I want you this write this in careful-like. So you remember your ma. Just say... "Susan Harvey. Died, October 15." Of fever. "Of fever, age 28." This all you want in here? Better add "North-west territory." It's turnin' colder. Back'. Back! Now you stay back. Davey! Dave! Pa! Pa! I'm here! You come with me. You gave the Cabin's-In-Danger whistle, Pa. I did? Where are we goin'? Saddle up. Don't see no danger. Blaze's liable to act up after bein' out all winter. Hand me that halter. That's not Cabin's-In-Danger kinda danger, Pa. Maybe not. Come on. You told me I shouldn't use Cabin's-In-Danger whistle unless it was life and death danger, Pa. You said it was special. Cabin can be in danger in more ways than one. Don't see no danger. We're proper farmers, Dave. Not woodsy folk. A man goes bad if he can't have bread with his meals and a stitched garment on his back. Hold him. Musket. Your ma had reading and writing and a little music. The menfolk in our family were smiths and farmers and maybe a doctor or the preacher like... - But not no-account. - I'm gonna be a hunter. I'm goin' off to hunt and trade with the Injuns. - Don't you ever say that again. - Why not? 'Cause you're not to forget that you're a Hannah. On account there's gonna be a lady around the cabin. - Pa! - You go on, get cleaned up. We're riding to the stockade to get me a wife and you a ma. I won't have no other ma! The devil, I will! Dave, you swear again and I'll tan the hide off of you. You see if I don't. Now, get! - And don't forget your shoes. - The devil, I will. Hey, Bob. Somebody wants to come across. Look, Pa, if you was to wanna change your mind and go home... I don't. Lead him on. I wonder what she'll be like. - Who? - Your new wife. Could be most anybody, I reckon. Big and fat like Mrs. Rictor. - Or a scrawny old bag of bones like some. - Yeah. I sure hope she don't whistle when she breathes or she's fat like Mrs. Rictor. Davey, you chatter like a chipmunk. We gotta take whoever we can get to take ya, Pa. - Welcome, Big Davey! - Howdy, Chad? - Any Injun signs? - No, clear all the way. How be Sister Susan these days? - Good afternoon, Big Davey. - Good afternoon, ma'am. - How you've been, Big Davey? - Howdy. Well, if it isn't Big David Harvey. Afternoon, Mrs. Rictor. And without Susan? Yessum. - Going to see the Parson? - I reckon. I ain't so sure Parson Jackson will cotton to this, Pa. Yeah, me neither. Who is it? Up above you, heavenwards. Oh, Brother Harvey, it's a long while since you came in out of the wood. Tell me. What brings ya? How goes the planting with you? And how's my little beauty, Susan? Parson, could I have a word with you, private? Ah. Marthy! Come brew a pot of sassafras for Brother Harvey. - Will of the Lord. - I'll speak a word Sunday. We wrote it into the Bible proper. What do you plan to do? Well, I told myself I gotta raise the boy the way she wanted. Proper raising, with Bible readin' and writin'. You told yourself right, Brother Harvey. Only a man with 30 acres cleared and a 100 more to clear and... well, crops to be put in and meat to be hunted can't raise a boy proper. Reckon that. What you need's a wife. Ah-ha! Oh, I've been fightin' it. Only it's easier spoken of than did, Sister Jackson. Unless you wait for new womenfolk to come from back east. Oh, I get my mind set. I-I'd rather not wait. There might be none either. - There's the widow Rictor. - Parson Jackson. Well, brother David didn't say he wanted beauty. He needs a wife. We can wait for Milly Plan to grow up. Oh, 15's a might too young to take on a widower's responsibilities. - There's Goody Cosgrove. - Now... And five kids to go with her. Parson, you're a fool. Miss Jackson, when it comes to a man choosin' a ma for his boy he wants a woman with experience. We can get along, Pa and me. The bondwoman. I hadn't heard about any bond servants in these parts. Yeah, Mr. Green got her for 1,000 bushels of parched corn from some river traders last autumn. There wasn't, but one woman around the Green's house then. Young Matt's got married since. I don't see as Mrs. Green needs anyone anymore. You could likely pick up this bondwoman for yourself at a bargain price, Brother David. Yeah. Sure. I could buy a bond servant instead of a wife. I was thinking she'd make a fine wife. Decent church folk don't live together man and woman under the same roof without marriage. Oh, no, no. Sure not. You're not only getting yourself a wife and Davey a mother... I don't want any other mother. But you're buying another human being out of servitude such things ain't forgot later on, Brother David. - Yeah, but I, uh... - Put pride behind thee. After all, it ain't for love you are wedding but to have a woman on the place. That's true enough. I'll go along with you to Brother Green and make the bargain. Ma, you better come along too. There's some human female questions in this that I ain't prepared to handle. Davey, run over to the store before it closes and see if anything came in for us. Now, get. Well, hello, young Davey. You holding anything for us from the east, Mr. Gallas? Sit and rest, son. I'm in a mighty big hurry. Oh, you young'uns can be in a hurry anywheres even on the far side of nowhere. Three months by sea, five by land and river three months of sittin' here wait to be took and young David Harvey, he's in a hurry. - What's your hurry, son? - I can't tell ya. Well, there you be, Mr. Impatient. All the way from Paris, France. I wonder what it is. - Thank you, Mr. Gallas. - All right. Oh, I forgot. Mind you don't sell all them sugar hearts. Pa promised me some sugar hearts, Mr. Gallas. I'll put some aside for you, Davey. Thank you, Mr. Gallas. You wouldn't like for me to take one on account? On account of what? On account I ain't had one in so long I forgot what they taste like. Here. Skedaddle. Thank you, Mr. Gallas. No, Big Davey, I gotta have 18 dollars now and four in the fall. I'll be making a profit, not selling to loss. Now looky here. Suppose I pay off three dollars? No. 18 dollars now and four later. I can't afford any more. Come out here, girl, where he can see ya. I stitched her two dresses. When we got her, she didn't have a thing to her back. Four dollars. I'll give up my fees, Brother Harvey. Give Brother Green his flesh money and I'll marry you for nothin'. Marriage? All right. Eighteen now and four in the fall. - I'll take it. - Done. How old is she? 25 and good health. Except she talks to herself. Do you talk to yourself? I guess I do. - What's your name, girl? - Rachel. - Rachel. - Well, let's get along. Ceremony will be the first thing in morning so that you can get an early start. You're welcome to stay at the parsonage with us, Brother Harvey. - Thank you. - Get yourself a wife, Pa? Yeah, I-I reckon so. Kinda thin, but... not bad lookin'. We're gathered together in the sight of the Lord and these people to join together this man and this woman in holy matrimony. Anybody here has any reason why these two should not be joined together, let him speak now or forever after hold his peace. Rachel do you take this man, David to be thy lawful wedded husband? I do. David, do you take this woman, Rachel. To be thy lawful wedded wife? I do. - Speak up. - I do. Put the ring on her finger. Now by the powers of the voice that I try to bring into this wilderness I hereby pronounce you man and wife. Oughtn't we be gettin' on, Pa? I reckon the stock needs watering. I'll fetch the horse. Don't forget to get this young'un his Bible teachin's. Thanks for the use of the ring, Mrs. Jackson. I'll walk you to Mrs. Green's for your things, Rachel. David Harvey's decent and hardworking. He ain't gonna be impatient. I think I can make him a good wife. I do too, girl. I trust, Brother Harvey, you'll be tolerant easing this girl into her duties. Oh, yeah. Of course. I've seen love take seed in rockier ground than this. But sometimes, it takes mighty tender cultivation. Oh, I ain't anxious in that direction, Parson, uh... on account on Susan, I mean. Don't expect any more than you would of a bondwoman. Well, Blaze only rides two, and if one of them's Dave... Pa, is it fittin' a bondwoman should ride and you walk? Well, I'm used to walking. Well, anyway it ain't fittin' a woman should ride astraddle. No need to ride to the barge. - Thanks, Parson. Goodbye. - Goodbye, Mr. Harvey. - Lord be with you. - Goodbye, Rachel. I hope we did the right thing. Amen, Marthy. Best of luck, Big Davey! My second one was skinny too. Pa, what's a bondwoman exactly? Well, uh... maybe she can say it better than me. I-I'd rather hear what you think. Is it like a slave? Well, you do have to put out the money for both of 'em. Ain't that so? Yes. Difference is that, well, slave don't get no pay but a bondservant can get enough to pay her worth and... and she can buy herself out. Where is she gonna get the money if you don't give it to her? - Well, that's true, too. - Then where's the difference? - Well, if you... - Difference is that... You'd better say. I was just gonna say the difference is that I couldn't leave anyhow. Why not? 'Cause I'm your wife now, too. Oh... - I'm hungry, Pa. - Well, so am I. But you gotta take care of Blaze first. You must be hungry yourself. I'll go first. Light the light. Eh. Out of here. Come on. Get out. Get out. Hush up, Musket. You'll find things in kind of a mess. Tell me where I should put my belongings, I'll make supper. Uh, well there's only one room besides this one. Put your things in there. Davey can sleep in the loft. Pa, this here parcel was meant for Ma. Uh, put it inside and save it till after supper. Stock needs feeding. "Susan Harvey." - I don't understand it. - Ticks to and fro. Regular as music. - That's what it is, Dave. - Music box? No, your mom sent away for some new contraption to give you music lessons by. I guess I won't get no music lessons now. We took a lot of trouble bringin' this spinet out here. It belonged to her pa. Drug it by boat, by wagon, finally by sledge all the way from the stockade. Oh. Davey and Jim Fairways and me cleared a path the whole way. Little music after supper is a mighty proud thing. Do you recollect, Davey? Uh-huh. If you close your eyes and listen to that tickin', you can almost hear her playin'. Pa, I'll never love any other woman like I did Ma. Go to sleep, Davey. - Goodnight, Pa. - Goodnight. - Oh. - We better turn in. I'll put up by the fire for the time being. Mr. Harvey? Davey? Go away! Shoo! Shoo! Oh... I hope you're loaded and I hope you know what you're doin'. Oh! Sounds like the new girl's finally up and about. Better go take a look. Guess I couldn't hit the broad side of a barn. Ma, she could shoot anythin'. It's not so good, me not bein' able to shoot, huh? Uh, it's like the boy says, Susan could take care of herself but I reckon with you, it's gonna be a little different. - Yeah. - I reckon she can't even whistle. Uh, we got a Cabin's-In-Danger whistle. I'll show you. Oh. Y-you try it once now. Go ahead. Uh, like this? Oh... Uh, uh, t-try it with two fingers. Like this, under your tongue. Mm-hmm. - That was good, Davey. - Yeah. - Well, you'll get on to it. - Yeah, yeah, I'll learn. Maybe you could help me, Davey. Come on, Pistol. He'll come around by-and-by. - I'll get breakfast now. - Had it. Oh, then I'll get right to the milkin'. I've done it. - The firewood? - Yep. You'll need a spell to come to know what's expected. - Oh, you mean chores? - Uh, yeah. It's more than just chores, I reckon. Yeah, I reckon. I expected so, Mr. Harvey. It's, uh... - Well, it's... it's appearances. - Yeah? Ain't easy to speak out, but we might as well talk about it now and we won't have to go over it later. You see, there was something special about us. About me, that is. The way I look at it, building a homesite ain't just doin' what you gotta do. There used to be a flower garden here and she was gonna lay some flat stones so the floor wouldn't get so tracked up. Oh, that's nice. Cabin's just a cabin, but it's, it's got a cellar like a house has, foundation like. It's like giving the boy readin' and writin' and arithmetic saying grace before meals. It's, well, keeping up appearances no matter how deep you get in the wilderness. I understand. Is that all? I reckon you'll have trouble with your hands at first. And it ain't fittin' that you're so frail you oughta fill out a little. I'll see to it, Mr. Harvey. You sure got a mess of hair. That's all I got to say. Except one other thing. At noon time, Susan used to come down to the fields where I was clearing. That's what I was wonderin' about mostly. - What's that? - Well, whether I was just expected to do the chores and give the boy his schooling or... - Yeah, sure. - Or was more expected? Well, you know other things, like... like, comfort and... and knowin' your moods and, and planning things together. Well, things a bond servant wouldn't likely do. Like goin' out to the fields at noontime to see her husband. Well, the only reason Susan came out was to bring me my meal. I'll... I'll bring your meal, Mr. Harvey. - Good mornin'. - Maybe. Morning, Davey. Come on, Pistol! Ho! Must've had most of these cleared. Yeah. Well, I'll be getting' on back. Come on! Come on, Pistol! David, did you have a good day? Uh, yeah. Are you hungry? Are you hungry, Mr. Harvey? - Yeah. - That's good. Goodnight, Mr. Harvey. - It don't seem fittin', Pa. - What don't? Always seemed to me the master of the house oughta have the best place instead of on the floor. Yeah. If she's to take the loft you and me could share the room like last winter, Pa. She's got little enough comfort, Davey. Come on, Pistol. And a good morning to you too. Now, don't go talkin' to yourself even if he don't open his mouth for months on end. Don't start talking to yourself. It ain't fittin'. You're the one. Maybe if I could get to know you through you, the boy and through the boy, his pa, th... Well, talking to a gun ain't like talking to yourself. If I could just learn to handle you without anybody hearin', th... Hit the candle. Hmm. Pretty good if we'd meant it. - Rachel? - Yes, Mr. Harvey? How's the boy doing with his schoolin'? He's bright. Pa, did you hear anything queer today? Yeah, I meant to ask. You hear it? Hear what? Well, as near as I could figure it sounded like one time back home when a jug of cider busted open in the attic. Sound comes from the north, I reckon. I reckoned it southernly. Uh, yeah, someone shootin' in the next valley, I reckon. - Yeah, I reckon. - Yeah, I reckon. Come on, get over there and jump through. That's it, come on, over. Over. Jump over it. Jump over. All right, Davey. Schoolin' time. Jump over it, Pistol, come on. Jump through. Davey! Why the devil won't you leave me alone? Please don't swear. Your pa don't like it. I'll swear like I want to, Rachel And you ain't gonna tell me to not. Davey, I want you to know something. I ain't trying to steal your ma's place. - You better shouldn't. - Not with you nor your pa. - You couldn't if you wanted. - I know that. It's gonna seem mighty queer to Jim. Who is Jim? Jim Fairways. A friend of the family. Oh. Well, what's gonna seem queer to him? Me in the loft, Pa, the master of the house on the floor, with you taking the best room all to yourself. - Oh. It ain't fittin'? - No, it ain't. You think I oughta take the loft? When Jim comes, maybe Pa will listen to him. Maybe so. Maybe so. But in the meantime, I gotta do my chores. I gotta do what's expected, teach you your schoolin' and try to keep cheerful. Oh, Davey, one of the reasons your pa wanted me here was so I could sorta mother you. The devil it was. You're a bond slave, that's all. Pa bought ya, I seen him through the window when he paid out your price. You was 18 dollars and four owing. You can go out today, Davey, without your schoolin'. Zowee! Come on, Pistol! Come on, Pistol. Mr. Harvey? Is right here all right? Well, hello, Musket. Takes Musket a while to get along with strangers. How long do you think it'll take? Uh, Mr. Harvey, I... I been concerned about your sleeping by the fireplace. No need to be concerned about that. Oh. 'Course, when I was at the Greens I... I-I did sleep in the loft. Hadn't thought about that. Davey and me could share the big bed, and there'd be no one left over to sleep on the floor. Would it be more fittin', huh? Sure, you're up first with the milkin' and breakfast. That's right. You know that way maybe the boy would be less resentful to you. Maybe. I'll see to it this afternoon, Mr. Harvey. You've been by the cabin, Dave? Been huntin'. Huh, no smoke from the chimney. Supper fire ought to be up by now. You seen Rachel since schoolin'? Didn't have no schooling today, Pa. What's that? Can I take your gun for one crack at that old turkey gobbler? - Can I, Pa? - How come you had no schoolin'? I want you to answer me, Davey. She told me I could go out without no schoolin' today, Pa. Just one shot at 'em, Pa. Gobbler's meat would taste mighty good for supper, Pa. What is it, Pa? Only an old gobbler. Gobbler call is the Shawnee signal. Now, be quiet. If I really was a Shawnee, I'd be hanging two fine scalps on my belt about now. Been along spell, Big Davey. Ain't you got a word of welcome for an old friend? Brung my own meat too. Jim, the devil himself wouldn't consider that a fittin' joke to play. I ain't acquainted with the gentleman yet myself. But I don't consider it fittin' for a man to keep talking about a boy's schoolin' when he hears a Shawnee call. At least not when there's signs of Shawnee up to the north. - That ain't a joke, Jim. - No, it ain't. It's been mighty fine here without any trouble of that sort. Well, trouble comes when you don't least expect it. Come on, let's get this deer off the horse's back and in our bellies. That ought to be enough meat to hold you for a while. You know, it must get pretty lonely for you, Big Davey, out here in the deep wood with no womenfolk. Well, it is and it ain't, Jim. You know, it ain't proper to raise a boy without womenfolk. No. Men can't hardly live without 'em either, unless he wants to grow up wild and woodsy. Jim, sounds like you're trying to talk yourself into something. Well, it's a fact, Big Davey. I got an itch to live within four walls. Figure to get me a wife and maybe a piece of land to break some wood out of. That ain't another joke, is it, Jim? - Who's that? - That? - Her. - Oh, her name's Rachel. Rachel? She's a bondwoman I bought from Matt Green. Had to have a woman around the place. Uh-huh. - Can't raise a boy properly. - Uh-huh. - Servant girl? - No. - Kin folk? - No. Just a bondwoman, huh? Well, a bondwoman or no, decent folk can't live together man and woman without takin' in marriage. Oh. Took her in marriage? Come on in and set. Rachel, uh, this here's Jim Fairways. - You've heard his name. - That I have. How do you do, Mrs. Harvey? How do you do? Davey, fetch the jug out of the barn. Yeah, so, Big Davey, looks like you've had just about everything a man could ever want for. Oh. So, you enjoy the idea of marriage, Mr. Fairways? I'm tracking it like a wild critter, Mrs. Harvey. Well, I congratulate the lady. She ain't trapped yet. Oh, you won't have any trouble. I ain't so sure. Well, now that we're down to honest talk, Mrs. Harvey is Big Davey the all-devastative and devoted husband he makes himself out to be? 'Cause if he ain't, you're a powerful good cook and I happen to settle in humor. I thought you might like something to eat with your conversation. It's mighty considerate, ma'am. Yeah, thanks, Rachel. Well, don't go away, Mrs. Harvey. Sit down. Yeah, sit, Rachel. Davey, you and me ever sing the hunter's song together? No. You play the spinet, Mrs. Harvey? - Yes, I do. - No, she don't. Rachel, you never mentioned you could do that. You never asked me. It has been a long time. Well, you can chord, can't you? Yes.

Too many things liable to start turnin' over in a man's mind. - Now, so long, Big Davey. - Goodbye, Jim. It was a pleasure meeting you, Mrs. Harvey. It's been a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Fairways. - Thank you. - You're always welcome, Jim. Bye, Jim. - Drop around any time. - I'll do that thing. After you get settled. Well, I... guess I'll bring in the wood for the morning. Davey, you go to bed. - Rachel? - Come on, Pistol. How is it you never mentioned being musical? You never asked. - Hmm, you said that before. - That's right. Well, that ain't what I wanted to talk to you about. Oh? Was Jim Fairways, uh... offensive to you this evening? Why, no. No, I thought he was mighty nice. And cheerful. Bein' the way he is, he seems to sort of take on around women. Oh? I just hoped he wasn't offensive. - Oh, no. - Even with Susan, he used to... That ain't what I wanted to talk to you about neither. Then what is it, Mr. Harvey? Well... sometimes I don't think I rightly understand people. Davey tells me you didn't give him his lessons today. - No, I didn't. - Well, why not? 'Cause he said I was nothin' but a bondwoman. Was the hurt of that so that you couldn't school him? It was the way he said it. I reckon I'll get me a drink of water. Hard liquor leaves you thirsty. - Where'd you learn music at? - My pa. Oh. Your pa schooled folks in music? Yeah, and other things. Guess that's why he died in debt. Don't pay very well. Then that's how you got bond into service, for your pa's debts? Yeah, that's right. Never knew that about you. - I reckon I never asked. - I reckon. You can play anytime you feel like it. Well, thank you, Mr. Harvey... Oh, I didn't mean it that way. I'll see the boy gets music lessons too, if you want. I may as we" give you a hand. Thank you. I, uh, I-I think I'll get me a drink too. Salt pork leaves you thirsty. Oh, look! There's a shooting star. Yeah, there are lots of them up here this time of year. - Pretty. - Yeah. Stars seem so close to you up here. It's funny how people get separated with miles in between 'em. Don't seem right. No, it don't. Dave, I thought I told you to get to bed. I'm thirsty. I reckon it was the singin'. Night. I suppose singin' does make you thirsty like salt pork, hard liquor. Your hair looks sort of blue with the moonlight. Moon does funny things. It... I never looked at your face so close on before. Guess I didn't have it pictured clear in my mind. I mean, what it'd be like gettin' married again. I was thinking mostly of the chores and... and the boy and... but I reckon there's more to it than I reckoned. There should be talking to each other... respect... maybe even.. What is the danger, Davey? You told me yourself, cabin can be in danger in more ways than one, Pa. Go to bed, Dave. - Aren't you comin'? - I said, go to bed. - I'm sorry, Rachel. - I know. He was very fond of Susan. Well, of course. Rachel, I... I reckon I ain't ready to fall in love yet. Hmm. - Where are you going? - To fetch the wood. You turn in, I'll get it. Piggy, piggy, piggy! Piggy, piggy, piggy, piggy!

Little something for the benefit of your music school. What brings you back, Jim? - Forgot my guitar. - Oh. Didn't figure I could start wife-hunting without store-bought clothes and my guitar. Staying tonight? You staying tonight? If, uh, Mrs. Harvey don't mind. She don't. Do you, Rachel? It's a joy. I took the liberty, ma'am, if it's acceptable to you. Little, uh... go-to-meetin' dress in token for the way you've taken care of my two boys here. It... is it fitting I should accept gifts, Mr. Harvey? - Hm, I reckon so. - Thank you, Mr. Fairways. I figured for sometimes after supper when you sit at the spinet.

These here from last fortnight are still fresh. Hadn't realized you'd been with us a fortnight already. - Oh, more than that. - Can I go swimmin', Pa? Yeah, I reckon. Come on, Pistol. Come on! Come on! Pistol, come on, boy! Looky there, Big Davey. It's the Sabbath, Jim. Listen, Pa, I heard it again. Yeah, it's queer. Reckon it's Shawnee, Pa? Probably nothin', but some old squatter. Unh-unh. Queer sound to it, I can't make it out. Oh, it's probably just an echo, you know somebody shooting off in some other valley and all you get is the echo. Don't seem right, Rachel at the cabin alone. Well, to set your mind at rest, I'll scout around on the other side of the valley. See you at dinner. Ma could've took care of herself. Yeah. Get your clothes on. You got your new dress on. Ain't you afraid you'll get it all wore out? - It's the Sabbath. - Uh-huh. - Dinner ready? - Yes. Where's Mr. Fairways? - He'll be along. - Oh. For the food we're about to receive the Lord make us grateful. - Amen. - Amen. Remember the last time I wore this outfit? Yes, I do. It's been more than a fortnight. It certainly has. It's been an age. - Oh, I didn't mean that. - Oh. Well, what's been more than a fortnight? Since he's been visitin'. Jim. - Don't seem like it. - Hmm. Must make considerable more chores for you. No, he's very generous about helpin' out. Not to speak of winter comin' on. Well, not till after autumn. And Jim and me are gonna go huntin' all next week. - He said so. - Oh, you are? Well, the way I'm thinkin', he may not be here next week. And stop eatin' like a pig. He's learnin' the boy woodsy ways. Not a sign, folks. Not a sign. Can't figure it out unless there's a ghost 'round these parts. Say, you kinda slicked out, ain't you, Big Davey? It's the Sabbath. - No sign of anyone shootin'? - Nope. Nothing to be seen on the surface. Let me help you with that, Mrs. Harvey. Oh. Thank you, Mr. Fairways. You know somethin', Big Davey? You and me ain't hunted a fox yet. We gotta test those hound dogs voices out. How about a week Saturday? Well, why wait so long? No hurry. I'll be around. ♪ La-da-da-da-da-da-da-da ♪ ♪ La-da-da-da-da N I Looked in the pool and what did he see? ♪ ♪ A beautiful girl ♪ That's where you come in. I thought you'd gone hunting, Mr. Fairways. Hell, I figured these garments were in need of a little wash. Well, just put 'em down right there, I'll do 'em for you. Why, I wouldn't think of adding to your chores, ma'am. Seems Big Davey's already took care of that. Anyhow, it ain't really the washin'. I... been trying to get you alone for quite a spell now. Only Big Davey seems a mite miserly with your time and company. I think you and me got a secret. That's why I figured it might be profitable if we had a little talk in private. I don't think it would be very profitable for you, Mr. Fairways. I'd rather you just went to Mr. Harvey with your discovery. Why, I only thought you could do with a word of advice on shooting, ma'am. You're losing your laundry, Mr. Fairways. Here. I'll do it for you. You know, first time I heard that shootin', I figured it might be you. Why? On account of Susan took to the musket just like a minuteman. Well, now why should I d... Well, just because Susan could shoot... Well, you're so much a pair in every other way including the husband. No reason why you shouldn't be the same with a rifle. Well, I don't hardly know how to shoot. Figured that. Well, then, I don't know what you mean, Mr. Fairways. Well, I just mean that you're settin' out to prove that you're just as good as Susan Harvey any day, any way. All I mean is I think you two oughta be friends instead of rivals. You would've liked each other fine. - What was she like? - Oh, like you mostly. How? Practical, patient, pure, pretty. - Maybe even beautiful. - Oh. Smart too. Smarter than me or Big Davey. She must have been. We both thought she'd marry me, but I never gave up hope. If she'd left Big Davey, I'd have married her in a minute. I'm gettin' better. - You're pulling to the right. - Yeah, I know. - Comes of jerking the trigger. - Don't you have to? Oh, no, you squeeze it, sort of easy and gentle. Sort of... caressing, like holdin' hands. I think it's near time for Davey's lessons. You know, I'm sure in need of a little schoolin', Mrs. Harvey. - Do you mind if I hang around? - No, not at all. We're having Bible reading today. - Rachel give you your lessons? - Sure, and Jim too. Jim's good at schooling, Pa. He thinks of things to do. For sums, we figured out how old a tree is by its circles. And how many weeks you'd take to get enough fox to make a fur coat for Rachel and such. Ain't you and Jim gonna hunt fox, Pa? Uh-huh. Then you're supposed to say, "Just like me." "Just like me." I reckon I'll do that. I reckon maybe I'd better. Can I sit with you while you listen to the hounds? No, Dave. Jim and me have been wasting for a talk for quite a spell. - Davey? - Oh, what? You better come in now, it's past bedtime. Listen, they're on to him now. I sure wish I was up there with Jim and Pa. Wonder why your pa changed his mind about goin' huntin'. He said Jim and him was wastin' for a talk for a long time. Pretty soon they'll light a fire up yonder and sit out all night listenin' to the hounds and pickin' them up by their voices. Well, come on now, you don't wanna stay out here all alone. Maybe after Jim talks to Pa you won't be telling me what I don't wanna do all the time. Well, suit yourself, Davey. - That's Musket out front. - Yup. - Tobacco, Jim? - No, thank you, Dave. I drug along the jug. Amy-Lou's a-tailin' him now. Yup. It's a mighty nice long visit you've paid us, Jim. Sure is. Mighty long for a walkin' man with an itch in his heels. Oh, I got rid of that itch. Sounds like they jumped him now. Never knew a walkin' man who could stop walkin' and take root in one place. Oh, some can if they got reason enough to settle. I recollect your saying something about settlin' down. Still do. - Clear a few acres? - That's right. - Get yourself a wife. - Yup. - Wives don't grow on trees. - Reckon not. Leastways not on the trees around here. Never spoke truer, Big Davey. You gotta go out a-hunting. Don't reckon I got so much hunting to do. Rachel's in trouble. Someone's gotta stomp out the fire. So I reckon I'll go on ahead. You can come down now, Davey. - Sure is a big 'un. - Yeah, sure is. Rachel, I'd sure thank you if you wasn't to tell Jim or Pa about how I... I... - Hey, Pa! - Here. A mountain cat. A big 'un. - Did you shoot him, Dave? - She did. I thought you said you couldn't tote a gun. And don't say I never asked you about that. I heard the steers bellowing, then Davey whistled here... Jim, a mountain cat. It... it was fretting the animals. Clean square between the eyes. No trigger jerking there. Thank you. Said you couldn't hit the broad side of a barn. I've been practicing in the cellar. Ain't you cold, Rachel? Oh. Come on, Davey. Come on. Let's get to skinnin', Big Davey. Wanna get an early start in the morning. You pullin' out, Jim? Like you said, I'm a man with an itch, and that ain't gettin' scratched the way things stand around here. Well, Jim, when you do get settled down, let us know and we'll have a cabin raising. - Yeah, thanks. - You all ready? Soon as I, uh, saddle my horse. I've already done that. - Mrs. Harvey, I... - Goodbye, Mr. Fairways. You're, uh, you're forgetting your guitar. You'll be havin' use for it, I believe. Thank you. Mighty fine, fair woman. Yeah. Reckon she's worth more than you paid out. Four's still owin'. I'm willin', Big Davey. I don't get what you mean, Jim. You paid out 18 dollars cash and four owing. I've got silver in my pocket and I'm prepared to pay you 40 dollars, cash money. She's my wife, Jim. You don't treat her like men treat a wife. You treat her like a bondwoman. I've been ten years in the deep woods, Jim. I never ordered anybody off my property. You ain't ordering me off, Davey. I'm leaving of my own accord, but not without Rachel. I offer to buy you out, fair and square. Wait till I catch my horse, Dave! - My horse! - My cattle! - Rachel! - What is it? - What's all that racket? - They're fightin'. Pa and Jim, like panthers. Men. Two full-grown men fighting like a couple of wild Indians. Why? All right, Davey, why was they fighting? - You shut, Dave. - You speak, Dave. Well, Jim wanted to buy you with a profit for Pa. - And Pa told him to... - You shut it, Dave! He'll speak if he wants and all he wants. - And so will I. - Maybe that's best. Now, you tell Big Davey you're going along with me. - Why, you... - Now, hold on. Hold on! Me going along with you? Now, this may... may come as a surprise to you, Rachel. It is to me, but I... 30's I can be bought and sold as you two please? Now, you wanna buy me so's you can have a wife and a slave at the same time just like he has. And then when you want to change you can sell me to somebody else like he's doin'. - Now, Rachel, I... - You shut! I'm beginning to believe that's just the way you think about a wife. Both of you. Someone to be bought or sold. Someone to cook for you and do your chores and flatter your manhood every now and then. Manhood. Just look at you. I'm going back to the stockade. And if you think the work I've done here for you and Davey and that lazy no-account hunter isn't worth 18 dollars cash and four owin', then you can warrant me with Judge Lang when he makes circuit. Only I wouldn't if I was you. 'Cause he likely to throw the lot of you in the guardhouse. Pa, better go after the stock. Come back, boy. Get in there. Get in there. Get in there. Go on. Get in there. Get in there. Rachel Rachel! Reckon I'll be on my way, Big Davey, as soon as I get a bite to eat. Worked up a powerful appetite. Pa. Guess we won't get no dinner cooked. Now, ain't that just like a woman? "Lazy no-account hunter." Seems kinda strange now she's gone. - Dave, fetch me my gun. - Where're you going? After her. - Gonna put a warrant on her? - Nope. Can't do much without you laying hands on her. I never laid hands on a woman in my life. Figurin' on reasonin' her back? - I ain't bringin' her back. - Oh. If she's ungrateful enough to leave the man that bought her out of bond and married her legal, then I don't want her. Well then, what are you going after her for? Shawnee. Ain't likely they'll move towards the stockade. Well, she might get lost. Mind if I ride along with you? It ain't my forest. - Get down, Davey. - Why? - Rachel, uh... - What do you want? Oh, nothin'. Nothin' except, uh... well, you might as we" ride. It's long ways to the stockade. - I walked it before. - Yeah. Well, uh... here's the horse. Ride him on back to the cabin and leave me alone. You're welcome to this horse, ma'am. No, thanks, Mr. Fairways, I'm walking. Alone. Well, we can't leave you in the deep woods. - Been Injun signs. - That's true. Rachel, you shouldn't go off like this. It ain't that I'm trying to stop you, only you're going the wrong way. Oh. You've gotta follow the river or you'll get lost. Thanks. Jim, I'd appreciate your allowin' me to speak to Rachel alone. Like you said, not your forest. I'm tellin' you to stay away from my wife. Ain't exactly your wife either, come to that. - Dave, hold this horse. - She won't like it, Pa. ♪ Dwells a spinster ♪ ♪ Nigh to a bachelor ♪ ♪ In between lives ♪ ♪ Foolish pride ♪ ♪ Long his heard ♪ ♪ And grey her tresses ♪ ♪ Knowin' not what ♪ ♪ Happiness is ♪ ♪ Thus they live there ♪ ♪ Side by side ♪♪ Rachel's got you right, Jim.

I guess they're mighty hungry. Plenty of game in the woods if they care to hunt. I reckon you're the better hunter, Jim. Well, thank you, Big Davey. I ain't accustomed to shootin' in the dark. Answer me this, Dave. Would you give me a half an hour to plead my cause alone with Rachel? Not while I'm able.

I reckon you take after her. Not after your pa. Go on. Get. - Pa. - Get, you ungrateful whelp. She ain't so bad, Pa. Just like a hound dog, take up with the first one to feed you. She told me to come back. She allowed you'd to be lonely. Well, what's she doing to make a man less lonely? I reckon we'll get somebody else to do our chores. I think if you was to ask her... I ain't askin' her no favors. Well, I'm gonna speak my piece. Get it off my chest and go to sleep. Those that don't care to listen, not obliged. Rachel, I'm asking that you marry me. Just as simple as that except for separatin' you and Big Davey. He never appreciated you. I ain't the catch of the river but I ain't got so much mule-headed vanity. I can't admit I'm in love and come right out and do somethin' about it. Well, that's my piece, I've said it. Now, I'm goin' to sleep. If you like the notion, you'll think it over. Let me know in the mornin'. I ain't never let Jim have the last word and I don't intend starting now. Ask her to come back, Pa. If the boy wants you to come back, that's good enough for me. I ain't beggin'. But I reckon if you was to say the word, I'd be willin'. Reckon the dogs would miss you too. That's a mighty queer-looking sky. Too far east for you, ain't it? - Is it forest fire? - Maybe. The cabin in danger, Pa? Rachel, you better take Dave and ride on to stockade and tell 'em. I'll go back with Jim if he's willin'. Davey, it could be Shawnees that set fire to the cabin. - Is that what they think? - I reckon. You think you can get to stockade alone? - Sure. - Well then, go there - and tell 'em, Davey. - But, Rachel... I gotta go back. I gotta. Now, go ahead. Shawnee haven't been on the warpath for a while. They've lost their eye. I reckon east-west gives the best vision. Pretty quiet back here. He's lettin' out the stock. Hold your temper, Big Davey. Davey, you start off, then I'll have to knock your head off. But they turned the stock loose. Better to lose a few head of stock than your own. Someone's comin' on a horse. It's Rachel come back alone. Moon's breaking out of the clouds. Head to the cabin! I sent Davey on to... to the stockade. - He'll make it. - Yeah, I reckon. Yeah. Rachel You shouldn't have come back. It's just a matter of time now and this ain't a fittin' place for a woman. I reckon I know best what's fitting for a woman. Fire is awful bad in the bedroom. Come on, Big Davey, we better hole up in the cellar. A little low of powder. Davey must be at the stockade by now. If you're a Shawnee, prepare to meet your maker. If you're Big Davey, stay put till we smother the fire. All right, you can come out now. - You all right, Pa? - Yeah, Davey. I brung 'em, Jim. So you did, young Davey, and I'm proud of you. - Where's my horse? - Out there. We were mighty worried about you. Sister Jackson's gonna be relieved. Come on, Parson, let's get after them Shawnee. Jim. I oughta give a word of comfort to Brother and Sister Harvey and arrange a cabin raising. You take my council, Parson, you'll leave them two be. Reckon they've had just about enough visitors for the time bein'. Are you leavin', Jim? I'm a free man, young Davey. I got an itch to my heel and a load in my gun. Ain't tasted food in a day and a half. Reckon I was just born to hunt the meat for other men's tables. Tell your pa I'll see him when spring comes around again. If you see Pistol anywhere, send him home! - Let's go, men. - Goodbye, Jim! We'll be back to help you build! Pistol! Pistol! Pistol! No more bedroom. No more loft. Oh! Now, that's a real pity. Oh, the heart of it's whole and good. And that's what's important. - I'll build a new case. - Yeah. I reckon I never told you. I like the way you play. There's a lot ahead of us. - Yeah. - Pa, Rachel. I found Pistol. He ain't hurt. He was hidin' all the time. - I am glad, Davey. - I'm awful hungry. Well, the fireplace is still there. Davey, you run on down the river and see if there's any fish in the trap. I'll cook up breakfast. But I'm all tuckered out. Davey... do as your ma says.
