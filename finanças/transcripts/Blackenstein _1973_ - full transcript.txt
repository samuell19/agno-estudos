Would you please tell him it's Dr. Winifred Walker. - Come in please. - Thank you. - Make yourself comfortable. I'll tell Dr. Stein you're here. - Thank you. (suspenseful music) (machines beeping) (buzzer buzzing) - Yes Malcomb what is it? - [Malcomb] Dr. Stein, a Dr. Winifred Walker is here. - Oh, yes, Dr. Winifred Walker. Bring her down to the laboratory. - [Malcomb] Dr. Stein would like to see you in his laboratory. (suspenseful music) (machines beeping) - Well well well. - Dr. Stein, it's so good to see you again. - My goodness you look wonderful. How long has it been? - Oh I guess about three years. Yes, because I've had my PHD in physics now for two years. I've never forgotten the year and a half I spent studying under you. - Malcomb Dr. Walker's a former pupil of mine. - How do you do Malcomb? - Fine Dr. Waler. - Well what brings you to California? - Well I just arrived from New York. My fiance was wounded in Vietnam and the doctors there wrote and told me he was being transferred to the veteran's hospital here. He was seriously wounded when a land mine went off under him. - Oh I'm sorry to here that. - I've decided to move here to be near him. I've got to help him in whatever way I can. (thunder cracking) (suspenseful music) Dr. Stein, I don't know how to thank you for this wonderful opportunity. - I want to thank you for coming to me. You just stick by my side. There's so very much to be done. - I read the results of you're winning the Nobel Prize in the medical journals and I've also read other doctors commenting on your success. Actually I was hoping there'd be some way I could stay on with you. You know I've got to help Eddie. Doctor I'd like you to look at him. To see if maybe there's something you could do for him. - What seems to be the problem? - Well, I'd really rather not say right now. But you know he's coming in tomorrow, tomorrow morning. Perhaps if we could we see our way clear in the afternoon we could go to see him? - Alright. I think I'll be free about two in the afternoon. Now let's go meet the patients. Time for your injection Eleanor. I'd like you to meet my new assistant Dr. Winifred Walker. - I'm happy to meet you Dr. Walker. - Please, call me Winifred. - Alright, Winifred. (suspenseful music) - Through my experience with the genetic code DNA I have a formula that's brought her from approximately 90 years of age to what you see before you. - [Winifred] The results are incredible. - But not without a few problems as Eleanor will tell you. It's necessary that she have an injection every 12 hours to preserve this condition. The DNA formula just isn't taking hold. We must work on a locking feature. I'm afraid if she went more than 24 hours without an injection she would go from her present condition back to her 90's and progressively older. Eleanor, you go to sleep now. We'll see you later. (suspenseful music) The complexities of Eleanor's case are very interesting Winifred. You might spend some time going over her records. - Alright Doctor I will. - Good evening Bruno. - Good evening Doctor, it's time again huh? - Yes, I'd like you to meet my new assistant, Dr. Winifred Walker. - Hello Bruno. - Hello. - I'm going to be working with Dr. Stein from here on and I'll be here helping you. (thunder cracking) (suspenseful music) - Now look at this Winifred. This leg was grafted on by laser beam fusion, supplemented by massive injections of my DNA formula. Hardly any scar at all and in time the scar will be totally irradiated. You feel that Bruno? - Yes. - Now he receives a shot daily. The area of injection is all around the scar. Alcohol Malcomb. - Alcohol, Doctor. (thunder cracking) - And DNA. - DNA. (suspenseful music) - Now Winifred. (suspenseful music) That's the result of an unsolved RNA injection. Sort of a part of the primeval theory, a kind of throwback to the jungle. I'm currently working on the RNA formula. I'm hoping to bolster and supplant the DNA, possibly replace it. I hope that the RNA when solved will not require daily injections like the DNA does. We'll check with you later Bruno. - Goodbye Doctor. (suspenseful music) - [Dr. Stein] Winifred you've never told me exactly what's wrong with Eddie. - [Winifred] Oh, remember I told you about that land mine explosion? Well Eddie lost both his arms and legs. (intercom buzzing) - [Woman] Dr. Cantor report to the admissions desk. - Yes may I help you? - We're looking for a Mr. Eddie Turner. - Excuse me. Excuse me Mrs. Wayne, do you know anything about a patient named Eddie Turner? - Eddie Turner, Eddie Turner, he's in ward five, that's intensive care. I'll have to accompany you. If you'll just step over to that door I'll press a button, they'll let you in. - Can I have some ice cream? - What the hell'd you say? - Can I have some ice cream? - Ice cream? Like hell, this ain't no damn hotel. - But my throat's dry. - Tough. Hey, hey, why don't you reach over there and have a nice cool drink of water huh? (laughing) Ah the hell with you. You think I got time to be running upstairs and around and all over just because one of you guys wants special attention? What the hell's so special about you just 'cause you're layering there huh? Well the hell with you. You know they called me to the service to. I went down there, I was 45 inches, 17 and a quarter, 28 inch waist, I walked down there like this and you know I get down there and I, and I, I get rejected, you know they don't take me, the old ticker there, from weight lifting. Oh what the hell am I even telling you this for? Big deal you laying there. You know it's my taxes and my friends taxes that are gonna keep you there. We gotta take care of you. Big deal, what the hell did you go for? You didn't have to go. You know that old scam, patriotism huh? To hell with you. Why don't you take a look at yourself huh? You look like a creep laying there, looking up at me with those stupid eyes of yours, what the hell do you know? I'll close those eyes for you. Time for your shot buddy. Nice big needle. Just relax. - His room is right down there two doors to the right. - Thank you. - Pardon me but we're looking for Eddie Turner. - Yeah, he's right here. But hey look you only got another 20 minutes, 20 minutes visiting time huh? - [Dr. Stein] Thank you. - Eddie. - Winifred, why are you here? - I know you said we shouldn't see each other any more, but I just had to. Eddie this is Dr. Stein. The doctor I studied with when I was in school. Remember I told you about him when I was in Hawaii to see you. I brought him here today because we, because we want to help you. If you'll let us. - Eddie I would like to do anything I can to help you. Although I can't offer you any positive promises I have been working in the field of replacing limbs. With your permission I would like to see what can be done in your case. - There's nothing anybody can do for me. - [Dr. Stein] Now Eddie don't throw out the possibilities. - Yes Eddie, Dr. Stein just won the Nobel Prize for solving the DNA genetic code. - I don't know Doctor. - Once again I can offer you no promises, other than my good results in the laboratory. I would like to very much work with you and to help you. But you must want to help yourself. If you do, and you're willing to undergo long hours of operating procedure and treatment I think you'll have quite a surprise, quite a surprise. (soul music) [music] Nobody cares [music] Nobody shares [music] Life is that way each and every day [music] I wonder will this, will this, will this always [music] Always be? [music] I can't find no one to love me [music] Oh, oh lonely old me [music] Oh lord I can not find [music] No one to love me (buzzing) (machines beeping) (electricity sparking) (suspenseful music) - [Winifred] Eddie, when Dr. Stein completes his surgery we can go on with our plans just as if nothing ever happened. - [Eddie] Do you think so Winifred? - [Winifred] Oh yes Eddie. - [Eddie] I hope so. - It will, it'll work out just fine you'll see. I do love you so. (suspenseful music) This is going to be your first injection of DNA Eddie. We're preparing your body for the operation. All set? - Yes it is Doctor. I prepared it in the lab. (suspenseful music) - Dr. Stein says our work will be in three stages. (suspenseful music) We'll be taking you down to the laboratory to begin work tonight but for now you just relax and get some rest. (suspenseful music) (thunder cracking) (suspenseful music) (machines buzzing) - Now Eddie we're going to give you an injection that will put you to sleep. When you wake up the work will be one third completed. - Okay Doctor. (machines beeping) (suspenseful music) (thunder cracking) - Eddie, try not to worry, I'll be right by your side. - Alright Dr. Walker let's proceed. Switch number one. (electricity sparking) (suspenseful music) (electricity sparking) Well I believe the operation will be a success. (dog barking) (thunder booming) (suspenseful music) (dog barking) (suspenseful music) (thunder cracking) Eddie, what do you feel? - It was my middle finger. - That's correct. Eddie tonight we begin the final phase of your surgery. - Dr. Stein, how long do you think it'll be before Eddie's completely whole again? - If all goes well tonight, why we can complete the entire process. - That's good Doctor. (thunder booming) (suspenseful music) (machines beeping) (suspenseful music) (thunder booming) - Malcomb, you startled me. - There's something I'd like for you to know. - Yes? - Winifred ever since you came here I thought of nothing but you both day and night. There isn't anything in this world I wouldn't do for you. I've fallen in love with you. - Malcomb, you have been very kind to me and I appreciate it and I do like you. It would be hard not to, but you must realize I love Eddie and as soon as he's well we're going to be married. I hope you understand this doesn't effect our friendship. - Alright Winifred. (suspenseful music) - Malcomb. (suspenseful music) - Primeval theory, primeval theory, primeval theory, primeval theory. Throwback, throwback, throwback, throwback. Jungle, jungle, jungle, jungle. Prehistoric, prehistoric, prehistoric. (suspenseful music) (machines beeping) Right there Malcomb. (suspenseful music) Well I believe we're ready for the final stages of our operation. - Fine Doctor, I'm ready. - Switch one. (electricity sparking) (thunder booming) (electricity sparking) (thunder booming) (suspenseful music) (thunder booming) Oh the fusion looks excellent Winifred. - Great Doctor. (suspenseful music) (thunder booming) - This is Eddie's DNA formula, prepare two injections please. (machines beeping) (suspenseful music) (thunder booming) (suspenseful music) Well Winifred Eddie should be up and around today. - Dr. Stein, I know he's been up and about with the walker but are you saying that he's going to be walking unassisted today? - Yes Winifred, from this point on with hard work he should soon walk like any normal man. (suspenseful music) Eleanor you haven't been listening to me. I knew this would happen, you've been up and about too much. Now I want you to stay in bed and stay in bed until I tell you you can get up do you understand? - I know I've been overdoing it, but I've been looking at the sunsets and the beautiful evenings. Oh please I want to be free, I want to be with people again. - It will happen all in due time, but you must conserve your energy and stay quiet. Winifred look at this. See she's backsliding. - There is quite a noticeable difference. - Eleanor I'll be back to see you later. You stay in bed now. (suspenseful music) - Eddie. - Yes? - Dr. Stein and I are here. How are you feeling tonight? - I don't feel right. I just don't feel right. - Now Eddie you've been through a lot and you've held up remarkably well. I think we'll get you up for a little exercise, it'll make you feel 100% better. All our tests show that you have total use of your faculties. - [Eddie] I don't know Doctor. - Dr. Stein, look at this. (suspenseful music) - Find Malcomb, prepare the room next to the lab. Tell him to get here with a gurney, we have to work fast. (suspenseful music) - Good evening Dr... (suspenseful music drowning out talking) - The brain is dying, it looks like complete cortical death. - Dr. Stein the cell matching tests seem alright. So there couldn't have been any error in our selection of the transplant part. - All the blood tests seem alright. No clotting or thickening. Run all the blood tests again. (thunder booming) (bell ringing) (distant talking) (suspenseful music) We have to get to him quickly. He can develop superhuman strength. (suspenseful music) (shouting in a foreign language) This is not too unusual Winifred, it happens occasionally after the shot. But the patient calms down. Very soon he turns to normal. That is outside of the obvious RNA effects. - I understand Doctor. (distant thunder booming) Eddie. (suspenseful music) (thunder booming) - Eddie, how do you feel? (suspenseful music) We'll increase the injections by 50 cc's. (suspenseful music) (bubbling) (thunder booming) (machines pulsating) (suspenseful music) (groaning) (suspenseful music) - Nice cool drink of water. Patriotism. The bands are playing, drums are going, blowing them, blow it out. Creep, freak, ghoul. Keep on lying there. (suspenseful music) (heart throbbing) (screaming) (suspenseful music) (heart throbbing) (groovy music) (dog whining) - Nelson. Nelson, Nelson I think that was my dog barking. - No it was nothing. (dog whining) (suspenseful music) - Listen that dog never barks unless something's wrong. He doesn't just bark for nothing now go see about it. - [Nelson] Oh that dogs been yapping all night long. - Nelson, the sooner you go out and see about that dog the sooner you can get back in bed and take up where we left off. ...Okay, okay. - Now that's a good boy. - Dog. (suspenseful music) (screaming) (suspenseful music) (heart throbbing) (suspenseful music) (screaming) (grunting) (wind blowing) (pleasant music) (suspenseful music) (dog barking) (suspenseful music) (thunder booming) (suspenseful music) - [Dr. Stein] Unsolved, unsolved, unsolved, unsolved, unsolved. (suspenseful music) (machines beeping) (grunting) (suspenseful music) (crickets chirping) (groaning) (rock music on radio) - It's a beautiful night isn't it Bess? - Yeah, yeah it really is. - You know I've been noticing you for a long time now. (laughing) - [Woman] I've heard that one somewhere before. - [Man] Yeah you probably have. ...Okay, okay. Look, don't. ...Okay... - I don't know what you're like, so just cool it baby. (rock music on radio) Look why don't you just take me home? I think I'd like to go home. - You have beautiful hair. - Yeah I know I do. - Aren't you proud of it? - Yeah I'm proud of it, now how about just taking me home? - Do you like to have it touched? - No I don't like to have it touched. Now if you would just put your hands on the wheel, lay off, and I want to go home, now. Alright that's it. - Calm down. - That's it. - Calm down, calm down. - Look don't call me baby, I'll call you. - You know I might as well be alone as be with you. - Yes you are. (rock music on radio) (suspenseful music) (grunting) (screaming) (grunting) (suspenseful music) - Winifred, I'd like to see you in the laboratory please. (electricity sparking) (grunting) Oh no. (grunting) Eddie, no Eddie, no Eddie, no Eddie, no. - [Winifred] No no. (screaming) No stop it Eddie. (grunting) (suspenseful music) - Malcomb, Malcomb get down here at once, hurry. (suspenseful music) Come on Winifred, we'll have to get Malcomb to lock him in I'm afraid. (suspenseful music) (doorbell ringing) (suspenseful music) - This way gentlemen. (suspenseful music) Excuse me Doctor, but two men from the police department are here to see you. I'll show them in. (suspenseful music) - Dr. Stein? - Yes. - I'm Captain Tucker and this is Lieutenant Jackson. I hope you don't mind answering a few questions. - Not at all Captain. - [Jackson] How many patients do you have here Doctor? - Just three at this time. - And one of them you brought in from the veteran's hospital is that right? - That's right a man with no arms and no legs. - [Tucker] And the other two? - A man and a woman. The man is confined to his room under strict surveillance. - And the woman? - The woman is suffering from a rare blood disease, she's been here about six months. - Well we're talking with everybody in the neighborhood Doctor hoping that we might pick up a possible lead. - Thank you very much. - Thank you. Good and we'll be checking back with you. - Thank you. (suspenseful music) (banging) (distant soul music) (wind howling) - Let's hear applause. (applauding) Let me tell you what happened to me the other day. (heart throbbing) (grunting) (screaming) And a girl walked in, a guy had a dog. The guy told the bartender, he said, "I want a shot scotch for me and shot of scotch for my dog." The guy said "man we don't serve no dogs in this bar." - The guy said, "man this is no ordinary dog." "This is a talking dog." The guy said, "man we don't serve no dogs in the bar." He said, "tell him what you want," the dog said, "man I want a shot of scotch." (laughing) The guys says, "I'll be darned," "his dog can't talk he must be a ventriloquist." He said, "okay I'm going to the bathroom," "dog you tell him what you want." The dog said, "man you gonna give me a shot of that scotch?" And he said, "I'll be darned," "if you really can talk here's five dollars," "go down to the liquor store" "and get me a pack of cigarettes." Dog takes off down to the liquor store, guy comes out the bathroom says, "where's my dog?" He said, "man I didn't think the dog could talk" "so I gave five dollars to go to a liquor store." He said, "man I paid $10,000 for that dog" "somebody might steal my dog." (laughing) So he's up and down the street. Three hours looking for his dog, he couldn't find it. So he's sitting on a garbage can in an alley, he's tired and from the back of the alley he hears a strange sound. The sound went something like this, woo bow wow wow, ooh bow wow wow. He jumps up and he runs to the back of the alley and there's his dog Rover. Got a Cocker Spaniel jammed between two garbage cans. Rover's doing his thing. Woo bow wow, woo bow wow wow, oh bow bow. He said, "Rover," Rover said, "what?" He said, "what're you doing Rover?" Rover said, "what does it look like I'm doing?" - He said, "shame on you Rover" "I've never seen you do anything like this before." Rover said, "hey you never sent me to the store" "with five dollars before either." (laughing) Thank you, thank you very much ladies and gentlemen. At this time ladies and gentlemen we like to bring the star of our show back to the stage. She's a fantastic lady so let's put our hands together and give a warm welcome to the star of the show, Ms. Cardella DeMilo ladies and gentlemen. Here she comes. (applauding) (soul music) [music] If you have someone that truly loves you [music] You should be thankful for what they do [music] You should be thankful, thankful, thankful [music] Oh that someone loves you [music] You could be lonely [music] So sad and blue (heart throbbing) (grunting) (heart throbbing) (screaming) (heart throbbing) (suspenseful music) (sirens blaring) - I saw him officer. He was about nine feet tall, he looked like he was hurt. Oh yeah, he went that way. - The only thing down that way is a cemetery and an abandoned factory. - The only thing next to that is a mansion, Dr. Stein's mansion. - Dr. Stein, let's check it out. - Good idea. Joe you better get the dogs. (sirens blaring) (grunting) (suspenseful music) Alright now just settle down and tell me exactly what you saw. - I told you once. - Well give me a description of what you saw then. - I'll go over it just once more. I just finished my gig, I was out in the alley taking a smoke like I normally do. I heard this broad scream. Then I took another puff, when I looked up there was a 15 feet shadow in front of me and you want me to explain that. - Well what happened after you saw the shadow? - What happened? Man I got the hell out of there. (thunder booming) (suspenseful music) - Feeling alright now Bruno? - Yes Doctor I feel alright. - Ah that's good. There we go. - He's calmed down quite a bit. - Yes. (suspenseful music) Alcohol Malcomb. (thunder booming) - Feeling better? - Yes thank you. - Alcohol Doctor. - And the DNA. - DNA. (suspenseful music) (thunder booming) (screaming) - No stop it. (screaming) (suspenseful music) (heart throbbing) (screaming) No! (screaming) (suspenseful music) No. (screaming) (heart throbbing) (grunting) Oh no. (grunting) (heart throbbing) (gun firing) (heart throbbing) (grunting) (groaning) (heart throbbing) (suspenseful music) Dr. Stein. The monster, it's Eddie! - [Dr. Stein] Get down to the landing. Prepare a massive injection of Demerol. We've got to stop it. I'll call the police. (suspenseful music) (heart throbbing) (grunting) (screaming) (grunting) (suspenseful music) (screaming) (heart throbbing) (suspenseful music) (gasping) (screaming) (heart throbbing) (suspenseful music) (screaming) (heart throbbing) - No, no.

(electricity sparking) (heart throbbing) (grunting) (suspenseful music) (heart throbbing) (screaming) (suspenseful music) - Are you alright? - Jim, Jim get me an ambulance code three, red light and siren.
