In October 2014, Dilma Rousseff was reelected President of Brazil potentially extending to 16 years the consecutive rule by the left-wing Worker's Party. Months before, a judicial investigation known as 'Operation Car Wash' unveiled a vast corruption scheme involving state-run oil company Petrobras. Senior politicians from the three main parties were accused, including Vice President Michel Temer and the House Speaker Eduardo Cunha, both a driving force behind the impeachment proceedings. President Rousseff was not implicated. The ones who want turmoil are those who don't want to vote. So I ask you to... I ask security to intervene. Keep calm! Keep calm, leader! Leader! Banners are not allowed up here. Actually, banners aren't allowed anywhere. There will be no coup, we will fight! There will be no coup, we will fight... There will be no coup! There will be no coup. We will fight for our beloved homeland, Brazil. Dilma out! Dilma out! Take your feet off the ground, if you want Lula in prison! I declare the voting session open. I will begin to call the deputies. For my family, for my beloved Chapec?... for my state of Santa Catarina... and for breaking the backbone of this gang... I vote yes. For my family, but mainly for my father Cesar Maia... run over by the Worker's Party (PT) when he was the mayor. PT rips apart the Constitution in Rio and here. I vote yes! For democracy, for the sovereignty of the popular vote, for human dignity, for those who fought against the military dictatorship, I vote no to this coup and say yes to Brazil! For my family, for my daughter... for my wife, yes to the impeachment! For the families and for the children in schools who PT never cared about. For the memory of Colonel Carlos Alberto Brilhante Ustra... the nightmare of Dilma Rousseff. How do you vote? For the army of Caxias, for our Armed Forces... Brazil above everything and God above everyone, I vote yes! How does Deputy Feghali vote? I would like to express my outrage, Deputy Eduardo Cunha... at seeing you in that chair with no moral fiber. Second, my indignation at seeing you embracing a traitor of democracy... who tries to usurp the President's seat. Vice-President Michel Temer, who has no vote. Third, it's very clear to Brazilian society... what the impeachment alliance is. It brings together Corrupt politicians, torturers like Jair Bolsonaro... and traitors of our country. And I vote no, against the coup. For the military of 1964, today and always. For the police, God and the Brazilian family, I vote yes! How does Deputy Jean Wyllys from the PSOL vote? I am embarrassed at participating in this farce, this indirect election conducted by a thief, devised by a traitor, a conspirator, and supported by torturers... cowards, political illiterates, and crooks. This sexist farce. For the rights of the LGBT population, blacks exterminated in the favelas... the right of artists, the homeless, the landless... I vote no to the coup! And sleep with that, you bastards! Deputy Eduardo Cunha, how do you vote? May God have mercy on this nation. I vote yes. In honor of the working people... who took to the streets today to resist the coup. I agree with you when you say "may God have mercy on this country". I hope so, because you are the head of corruption in this country... presiding over a court that will judge an honorable woman. And, President, don't kid yourself with that smirk... You're up in the Federal Supreme Court. I vote no! Against a party... which uses national foreign policy to employ the country's resources to fund bloodthirsty Bolivarian dictatorships. Against those who use education to indoctrinate and harass our children. For better days for our country... free from this gang that embedded itself in our core. And with all my heart... Yes! Dilma out! I'm Brazilian, I'm proud, with lots of love... I'm Brazilian, I'm proud with lots of love... The impeachment proceedings are authorized.. against the Madam President due to the accusation of impeachable offense... offered by H?lio Bicudo... Miguel Reale Junior and Jana?na Paschoal... for the opening of additional budget without Congress authorization. The placid banks of the Ipiranga heard The resounding cry of a heroic folk And the sun of Liberty in shining beams Shone in the homeland's sky in this instant If the pledge of this equality We managed to conquer with strong arm In thy bosom, o Freedom... THE TRIAL Yes, then we'll have six months before the trial. Don't mention it. Goodbye. - Dai! - What? - You may transfer the other call. - Do you have a copy, senator? No, I have one here from the UOL guy. I have no copy here. Wait, I'm printing. But go ahead and call. I have to go to the Committee. Where is the causality? Revenue fell due to the crisis. Or is it the other way around? He says the President spent more and that led to a crisis... What is the best excerpt to quote? What is the best part for me to highlight? Here. "According to the message..." "According to the message, the evaluation takes into account the effects of the bill that changes the annual budget." This is a Congress decision! And in addition, he says, "I am aware of the message..." I don't have time. Just say that he dismissed it with no reservations. And it was approved unanimously by Congress. The key issue is that the Senator analyzed... knowing that the Executive was using a new annual budget... and he approved it. That's it. Those two things are the key issue. The Executive acted in accordance with Congress. Now it's a crime? I'm ready. I'll go to war! The bad thing is that we don't eat! April 28th, 2016. A Senate Committee examines the charges: 1. the issuing of six fiscal decrees without Congress approval. 2. the so-called "pedaladas": a delayed repayment of the agricultural subsidies spent by state banks. Dilma has been accused of two things. Delaying payment of the Farm Subsidies to the Bank of Brazil... and six additional budget decrees. We've been explaining... that there's a 1992 law which shows that the Farm Subsidies... are managed by four ministries and the Monetary Council. The President takes no part. So we're asking for documentation. From the Bank of Brazil, Ministry of Agriculture... Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Planning. And another thing. Six additional budget decrees. A widespread practice not considered illegal. We need documents from the departments which requested funds. The Federal and Electoral Justice departments... the Ministry of Education. I plead with you. You're curtailing our right of defense. We said that a rapporteur from the opposition would be biased. It seems true! Article 45 of Law 1,079 states: "Within the period, the committee may carry out the verifications it deems necessary." The rapporteur has a view, the committee will vote. Mr. President R. Lira... I put to the vote request 16 of 2016. The senators who agree with the rapporteur's assessment... should remain as they are. Dismissed. Mr. President, but it's sad to see how this session is being led. I feel like we're lambs led to the slaughter. This committee has made up its mind. Whatever we say, it's already been decided. The rapporteur knows what he's going to report and most of us know how well vote. That's sad. These requests aren't meant for a later stage... but for us to examine the admissibility of the accusation. Where's the just cause? Because it shows President Dilma did not commit any crimes... relating to the six budget decrees... since they were supported by a law voted in by the Congress. Get him and Dalmo. Before the report we should bring up preliminary statements. Lindbergh will bring up the Government of Minas Gerais. We have Z? Eduardo's appeal which also states.. the rapporteur should be suspect because of his party, PSDB. - He replied the same day... - But not at the committee. He just published it. We need to discuss it in the committee... "You used accounting tricks in Minas Gerais." That's it. We're not trying to win the point of order, but to discredit him as rapporteur. It's just a matter of time until the President is removed. This game is rigged. It's make believe. But in this rigged game, we also have politics, gestures. PMDB party, the greatest beneficiary of the coup... appointed five names which are already dirty. That's a crime, not a trial. The report by the opposition PSDB was without surprises. We're not going to endorse a rigged game. I'm asking you to think about a political gesture. Dilma, a fighter for the Brazilian nation! April 29th, 2016. Opening statements of the prosecutor and defense. Ladies and gentlemen senators. We will now pass the floor... to Jana?na Paschoal... the lawyer and professor of criminal law... at the University of S?o Paulo. It was my moral obligation... to bring this to Your Excellencies who are judging this matter. Your Excellencies can be absolutely confident... in admitting the complaint. As a plaintiff, I ask that you admit it fully. Because this is part of a whole... which shows the coup my country fell victim to. Don't Your Excellencies think I'd be happy to see a woman... be successful as President regardless of her party? I'm a Brazilian woman! I love this land more than anything. I'm here because I'm Brazilian, that's my party. I've never voted for PT (Workers' Party). But when President Dilma gave an interview and said she used to dream of being a ballet dancer, I cried. That ballerina got lost. She got lost and left me no alternative. As a Brazilian, as a lawyer... as a teacher of criminal law, as a lover... for I am in love with the Federal Constitution... I had no choice. After my first big speech... I received calls even from foreign journalists... asking if I'm a priestess or a shaman. And I tell them "I'm not enlightened enough... to be either a priestess or a shaman." And if I were a priestess or a shaman in a secular state... my legal work wouldn't be diminished. A secular state is not an atheist state. It's a state which allows... all religions to coexist peacefully. If I was a priestess or a catechism teacher... I'd be honored to verify it. But I'm not those things. I'm just a law professor. And in a republic... this is the sacred book. This is the sacred book which allows... every other sacred book to be respected and coexist. What I want is that the little children... the little Brazilians who can hear me... I want them to believe... this sacred book is worth fighting for... PT never signed this book! I pass the floor to Jose Eduardo Cardozo, Attorney General of the Union. This impeachment trial... does not comply with the Constitution. There's no impeachable offense, it was a pretext... a glaring illegality in the proceedings in the House... and if this impeachment is carried out, it will be a coup. It's notorious and thoroughly recorded by the press... and if it's notorious, it doesn't require proof... that Speaker Cunha began this action... the very second after the Workers' Party... denied him the votes he needed to elude the Ethics Committee. He was the subject of proceedings... lost the support of the opposition, which was publicly against him.. and, as the press reported several days earlier... he threatened the Government. "Give me the votes I need... or I'll start the impeachment." PT turned him down... and he immediately started the impeachment. Secondly, there's no criminal intent because there's no action. The Farm Subsidies are managed by the Minister of Finance, not the President! How do the plaintiffs overcome this? First, they said the President had frequent conversations with Arnon. Are conversations a legal fact? If I talk to a senator and he murders someone... will I be an accessory? Where do you get this kind of thing? To deem a conversation a legal fact? They don't know its content. It was based on a news article... which reported that she and the treasury secretary talked. On top of it, they say: Listen to the alternative. If it's not this, it's omission. Omission? To have a situation of omission, a specific duty must be neglected, and did this happen? No. They use Article 84 of the Constitution to say the President manages everything. So I can impeach her if someone steals a stapler. Is that right? It's the President's duty... to manage the top layers of the federal administration. And we are discussing the upper management of Brazilian state... where, for some years, a wicked, irresponsible management... led Brazil into the worst crisis ever. It was all part of a large scheme, or a great fiscal fraud... perpetrated deliberately by the Government to try to win the 2014 elections. It's not just a set of mistakes, but a complete destruction. We're discussing this destruction. It was all prepared with the knowledge and authorization... of the President, who lied to the Brazilian people. I confess, I don't know if President Dilma Rousseff is honest. But I'm sure she lies. Do you know how to remove a President? With elections. You go on TV and say... "Dilma ruined us. Don't vote for PT." But in order to impeach her, there must be a legal reason! All the literature and case law states that! May 5th, 2016. House Speaker Eduardo Cunha is removed by the Supreme Court on charges of corruption and obstruction of justice in "Operation Car Wash", which investigates the corruption scheme at Petrobras. I agree with your assessment. Brazil was already expecting the removal of the House Speaker... but it was too late. We could have avoided most of these crises. Not just the President's impeachment but the intentionally harmful bills... the delays on votes for crucial measures to our economy. We could have avoided many things that led the country to this. It is clearly a good thing for Vice-President Michel Temer, because the Speaker of the House would replace him if he was removed from office. It eliminates the possibility of us having as President... someone as compromised as Speaker Eduardo Cunha. Thank you. My best to everyone at Radio Nacional. Have a nice day. Good morning. Good morning, how are you? Good morning, how are you? The fact that I conducted the session, which culminated in the voting... led to an expected reaction. From then on, they convinced everyone to take me to trial in their company. But this will end next Wednesday. If it is God's will, the President will be removed and consequently tried. Are you not going to resign? No, I will not resign. The mandate or... Neither the mandate nor as House Speaker. I will appeal, and I hope to succeed. Thank you! Cunha, you thief, your place is in jail! Is that it? Do you mind if we shoot a video for Londrina? Ready? Is it recording? Hi, I'm Felipe Barros here in Brasilia... with the great Jana?na Paschoal... who has been brave and fearless. An excellent lawyer, moving the impeachment forward... for us to remove President Dilma and all those criminals. Can you send a message to Londrina? Hi, everyone. Thanks for your support... for your positive thoughts and prayers. The most important part is not to win, but what takes place during this trial. People should see that they're powerful and capable. They shouldn't give authorities control over our fate... and just accept everything. Young people should study hard and enter politics. Politics is about doing good for others. We need to change the concepts of our society. It's a time for renewal. All my best to Londrina, God bless you. Thank you very much. Congratulations. - Thank you. - I've been praying for you. Thank you very much. Think about what you would ask. I made a note there. Notwithstanding political differences, I believe senators should have... respectful relationships with their peers but mainly, a commitment to the truth. I take seriously the issue with the post I saw this morning... which attributed to A?cio Neves words he never spoke... in circumstances which never happened. I believe it was an unfortunate oversight... by Senator Lindbergh's advisers... since it was posted on his page. I posted about Senator A?cio Neves and the taking away of labor rights... and the senator won't be able to hide it. You're reiterating your insult! I want my time! You're repeating... - I want my time. - The lie... posted on your page. If your advisers did it, they're accomplices! Let him speak! I've heard it... I asked them to replace the buzzer. It's not worthy of this impeachment committee. I just want my time. The session is adjourned for 5 minutes to replace the buzzer. It's not worthy of this historic moment. I'd like Senator Lindbergh to have the floor all to himself. That senator can't hide from Brazil the fact that this is a parliamentary coup... because there's no impeachable offense. Your excellency should stick to the subject at hand. The subject is labor rights. This is "Bridge to the Future", by Vice-President Michel Temer... He has the right to speak! Point of order! You're an arrogant opportunist! - Your Excellency, calm down! - I'm too calm. - Recompose yourself. - Senator Lindbergh Farias has the floor. It's in "Bridge to the Future" I'm not making it up. "No more minimum wage policies." "No more indexing it to welfare." You will answer to the Ethics Committee for your insult! Is it an insult to say A?cio and Temer... want to take away labor rights? "Bridge to the Future" destroys the legacies... of Presidents Lula and Get?lio Vargas. They want to privatize everything, to give our reserves to big oil companies. They'll end the sharing of oil revenues. They want to make concessions. They don't want to hear about BRICS or Mercosur. They want to realign our foreign policy with North-American interests... this is why they're attempting a coup... because nobody would be elected President with this program! If social programs are at risk today... it's because they're leaving us a country in shambles. If labor rights are being abolished... it's because our country has 11,100,000 unemployed. We can either make a quick decision... while following the proceedings determined by the Supreme Court... or face the steadily worsening conditions... of the country's political and economic landscape. We will now vote on Senator Anastasia's report. The senators can vote with the electronic voting system. What is the result, Mr. President? - Open it up. - Let's see the results. Has everyone voted? The results. The official results are Yes, 15. No, 5. The voting is closed. The Committee voted to accept the accusation. May 12th, 2016. The Senate Committee accepts the charges. Rousseff is suspended from office for 180 days. Vice President Michel Temer assumes the presidency. Dilma, a fighter for the Brazilian nation! Temer out! Temer out! One, two, three, four, five! Stop this coup or we will stop Brazil! One, two, three, four, five! Stop this coup or we will stop Brazil! Dilma, a fighter for the Brazilian nation! Fate has always presented me with many challenges. They were many and they were great. Some seemed insurmountable. But I managed to overcome them. I've suffered the indescribable pain of torture, the agonizing pain of illness... and now I suffer, once again... the equally unspeakable pain of injustice. What hurts the most right now is the injustice... realizing I'm a victim of a legal and political farce. Prosecutor Janot is after you and he thinks I'll help. We need a new Government to stop this bleeding. The easiest solution would be to put Vice-President Michel. Renan is the only one against it! He doesn't like Michel, who's with Cunha. Forget Cunha. He's as good as dead. We need to put Michel up there, with a great national pact. - With the Supreme Court and all. - It would stop it. Right, it would stop where it is. "A pact with the Supreme Court and all." Sergio Machado says, "It would stop it." Juc? continues, "It would stop where it is." It continues, there's more. Senator Juc? says, "I talked to some Supreme Court Justices." He must tell us who those Justices are. "They said it's only possible without her there. While she's there, the press, the guys will want to get her out. This thing will never end." It is clear that their objective is to stop the Car Wash investigation. It is a denial of due process... to prevent those recordings from reaching this Impeachment Committee. It so happens that those recordings don't interfere... directly or indirectly, with the impeachment. After all, we were defeated on the thesis that we should consider... operation Car Wash in our debates. These tapes aren't being brought in to discuss Car Wash... but to show they want the impeachment to remove a President who protected the investigation. Furthermore, it's curious how Senator Anastasia refers... to the examination of the Court of Auditors, "A request for international audit wouldn't be efficient as the defense requests... since that task has already been carried out." The Court of Auditors didn't do that. The accounts weren't even the object of a report. The report claims... the Court of Auditors has done something it hasn't. And I can't debate this. I can't discuss each request... or the witnesses brought in by the prosecution. I can't prove anything. All I can do is speak. So I speak, and I analyze 80 requests in ten minutes. I tell you the President's right of defense... has had its substance replaced by form, because form guarantees appearances. As someone said, "It's not a coup, due process is assured." Due process doesn't mean the right of defense has substance. It gives apparent legitimacy to something illegitimate. It's absurd not to have an expert examination. We have the testimony of one prosecutor. But the Government didn't even inform the Court about the facts. Practically every point we bring up is rejected. The people are curious, and they ask... "Why do you keep insisting? You lose almost every time." I am concerned about how the population sees this... considering how the press publishes it. It might become even more discouraging. I'd like you to consider if it's not adequate to tone it down. - But why? - One thing is the political debate... and another is to stall like this. We know we'll lose at the committee. But we have to resist. If we get soft, they'll get it done before they expected... and we need time for politics. We need to do whatever we can. Present appeals, petitions, points of order. And if we have more people, all the better. Other people can speak too. You might be right about Justice Lewandowski. When he denies something, it's a strong statement. So we need to be foolproof. If we need the expert examination, let's consider our appeals. And in everything we do, we need to explain... that the President is being denied her right of defense. I don't think that, when we present an appeal... and it is denied, we're legitimizing the process. They started presenting appeals too... so that Lewandowski denies theirs as well. We need to consider again. - I disagree. - If we're denied, we legitimize it. But the witness? It would be bad to lose. We'll end up legitimizing it. Let's talk later. I'm not sure if these strategies are the best. Well suspend it. We'll make a second appeal. Her nickname is Penelope Pitstop. It's perfect. She is known as Penelope Pitstop. Congress is so beautiful. It is the most beautiful building in Bras?lia. - Is that the Senate? - The House. - We were there? - The Senate is there. No, those are the offices. Come, F?tima. Good evening. People want to end this process very quickly... It seems the clock is ticking. I don't know what's behind it. Some might fear new facts may bring imbalance to the trial. Can an eventual accusation bring problems? We don't have that concern. We want a fair, balanced trial. Justice Lewandowski will decide the date... but this cannot be done in haste. Hi, dear. I'm Carol Proner. In France, where I am a senator... the expression "institutional coup d'etat"... when we refer to Brazil, is also rejected by some politicians... and what makes me "sadder", and this is a euphemism... is the fact that, unfortunately... the French Government has not shown its support. And I must confess that the French press also finds difficulties... because there are few independent media in France... as here, but I must admit that the French media today... I am sorry for that, is more focused on the Olympics... and the Government remains silent. Thank you, madam. This may come as a surprise, but recently.. in a conversation with a deputy. I was struck when told me... that he thought I was a cold, calculating, insensitive person. Because I did not resign and I'm not sure why. This version given by the media has been incorporated. But the media has another version too. Which is very common when it comes to us women. That I was out of my mind... taking prescription medicine. I'm not on meds and I'm not out of my mind. So they don't get it right. The version oscillates. I am either cold and insensitive because I don't resign. I don't cry and I don't play the victim... or I'm having a nervous breakdown Thank you. Come on, Carol. Come on, Madam Senator. The denial of things is typical of coups. In Brazil, for a long time, we political prisoners did not exist. "No. There are no political prisoners in Brazil." And we were in jail. That was our struggle. Yes, so that we could exist. We are on the right side and we will win as we did then. Back then there was no Internet. It took twenty years. Now we have the Internet. Take a picture with my cell phone. I'm counting on you. Requi?o, if they don't absolve me... You'll have to get on board! June 14th, 2016. Congressional Ethics Committee votes to expel House Speaker Eduardo Cunha from the Chamber of Deputies. PT imagines I did this to get back at them... as they didn't support me in the Ethics Committee. I met the chief of staff three times... and every time Jaques Wagner offered the PT votes... in the Ethics Committee. He even offered... to keep my wife and daughter out of this... since they were under a separate investigation. The Government offered the votes from PT. I didn't ask. Not only did it sound like blackmail, it involved my family. I didn't think they had that prerogative. Why didn't you report it when it happened... as should be done by a politician as righteous as you claim to be? Because I refused it. It's part of politics, of political conversations. There's a rumor you could consider a plea bargain... to decrease your wife's possible sentence. I didn't commit any crime, I have nothing to say. I have nothing on me or on anyone else. I'm from "Correio Brasiliense". You're a defendant at the Supreme Court... in the Car Wash investigations, accused of taking bribes abroad... and having secret accounts. You lied to the investigators. Do you really think you have political... ethical and moral authority to continue as Speaker of the House? You're making a political speech. It's a question... I won't answer. Next. Vice-President Temer must dirty his hands to try and save Cunha's neck. If he's removed from office, Temer is going down. Cunha is destructive. He's concerned with his wife. He's desperate about his wife and daughter. - He will inform on anyone. - Judge Moro blocked his assets. - Now? - Half an hour ago. In Congress, the mood is one of expectation. Nobody knows what will happen. Even Marina was mentioned today. And we're not having it easy either. Not at all! We only see their misfortunes, but what about us? What about Lula? PT's reputation has already been damaged enough... even though it can get worse. They might arrest Lula. The country's reaction might be strong, but it can be really bad if Lula is arrested. They can try to convict Lula... to prevent him from joining the elections. In all likelihood... plea bargains will do more harm to them than to us. At least we have that. Cunha's downfall benefits us a lot more. There's a good side to them being targeted. It shows it's systemic. The feeling the people might have in a couple of months is: "Screw them, they?re all corrupt!" It's in the last opinion poll. Everyone has low ratings, Lula and others. We need a political reform. After all the parties being hit. The people who took to the streets in 2013, and still do... aren't defending our Government... but opposing another movement... resisting the establishment, conservatism. The youth takes to the street, but not under our banner. Some are under Dilma's banner because it represents something... represents resistance, but we have no control. Just like the women's movement. Dilma, as much as she represents them, doesn't lead those women. Her Government was too conservative on some things... which was bad. We need to understand this movement... that's been resisting a conservative offensive. We shouldn't be separated from it, fighting only the impeachment. We can talk about a referendum that's great... but this is not their everyday lives. I agree that a referendum is the solution. Speaking candidly here. There's no governability if we go back to power. She doesn't have support here, no structure in the Government. We need to speak to the people. If we're not clear on what's at stake... if we don't align ourselves with civil society, we'll be adrift. Why did she commit an impeachable offense? She has issued additional budget decrees in conflict with the law... which authorizes those decrees under one condition. the annual budget must be met. The annual budget was not being met, and from the second half of the year... the Government began to count on a bill... that was still being processed by Congress... and which was only approved on December 3rd. And the biggest fiscal fraud in Brazilian history... when, using subterfuge, the Government obtains loans from State Banks which is forbidden by law. He replies: "The budget was approved by such law... and is Valid for 2015, with no stipulation for partial use of these values." They claim it's an impeachable offense... not due to the annual budget, but to the decree. He's wrong. That's why we need to dismantle it. It's so easy we can laugh in their faces. Are you out of your mind? You're saying she met the target at the end of the year... but when she signed the decree... the target was not being met. And she could only have done it through a law. How can I pass a law to break another law? The Budget Office says the target was met, as does the legal adviser. The Minister of Planning too. Besides, the experts say there was a presumption of legality... on behalf of the person who acted. Nobody thought it would be illegal... since it had been done for all those years. I have several documents: the Federal Budget Office... stating that the decree was compatible with the annual budget. In his reasons, the Minister of Planning... also said the decree was compatible with the budget. All agencies said it was compatible. The Minister, the Budget Office, the legal adviser, the chief of staff. I pass the floor to the Minister of Finance. These six decrees signed by the President at no time authorize the increase in expenses. They only modified the alternatives... on which the same amount could be spent. This was established in the contingency decree. Most of these funds went to the Ministry of Education. For instance, the Ministry of Education... requested this financial surplus to support early childhood education... as authorized by the Budget Law. Before the decrees were issued, the Government had cut expenses sharply. So we can't say that those decrees increased expenditures. On the contrary, those decrees came after a reduction of R$ 8.5 billion. They don't conflict the annual budget because they do not increase expenditure. Responding to inquiries by several senators... it's clear the Government deliberately used the approval of Bill 5... which characterizes a disregard for the Budget Law... therefore an impeachable offense since the Government approved a target... which was still being processed by Congress... and was only approved at the end of the year... as if to clean the crime scene. This is crazy. This is "The Trial" by Kafka, President Dilma is Joseph K... They can't prove anything. We don't spend one cent more with these budget decrees! The Federal Police had arrest and search warrants in five states. They also searched the flat of Senator Gleisi Hoffmann and her husband, former Minister Paulo Bernardo. He was arrested in Bras?lia and taken to S?o Paulo, where he will be held under preventive detention. According to the investigation, the law firm linked to Paulo Bernardo received about R$ 7 million from the scheme. What happened to my husband is inexplicable. If he was being investigated, why didn't they call him to testify? He never refused to do that. He has always been living with me in Bras?lia. They didn't have to spend money on helicopters, cars... and police equipment. They just had to summon him. If he had to go at that moment, he would go anyway. This investigation started one year ago. It's not as if his freedom would jeopardize the investigation. Nothing justifies his preventive detention. I didn't understand. We never refuse to testify. Within the Farm Subsidies, we have a program for family farming... which has been growing every year. In 2002, it was worth about R$ 2 billion. Since last year, 2015... this program has received up to R$ 30 billion. These are funds going into family farming. And there are Farm Subsidies, investing in corporate farming. The Government and the President don't take part. These funds are transferred from the Bank of Brazil to the farmers. It's a loan with subsidized interest... because agriculture worldwide deserves attention. The accusation states the accounting tricks were not just operational delays... as the debts accumulated for a long time... and became very large sums. They were true loan transactions prohibited by the Fiscal Law. The defense argues that the delays cannot be considered loans... because the money is lent to farmers, not to the Government. I consider it burdensome that the President... was aware of the irregularities that were being practiced. If I delay paying my family's supermarket bill... they're not lending me money. There's no loan contract. No money was transferred from the bank to the Treasury. The bank shifts the resource to the farmer... and the Treasury shifts the subsidy to the banks. What is a loan? What farmers do with the bank: they sign a contract, borrow money and grow their crop. Agriculture could be at risk if we were to regard farm subsidies as loans. Many people asked me if I would come back here... after my husband's arrest, and I said I would. I return with my head held high to defend President Dilma's mandate. And I'm pleased with the examination... regarding the so-called Bank of Brazil accounting tricks. Item seven states that the Ministry of Finance... doesn't define a deadline for payment to be made to the Bank of Brazil. If there's no deadline there's no delay. And item 12 states that nothing the president has done... contributed directly or indirectly to the delays. If there's no action, there's no criminal intent. I'd like to ask if the Ministry of Agriculture... was warned by the Bank of Brazil, the Court of Auditors... or any other supervisory agency about the defaulting... on the interests of these subsidies. Mr. Patrus Ananias has the floor as witness. Three minutes. Excuse me, please. Later you'll be given more time. I have to defend my honor. Your Excellency mentioned me after the committee on Friday. When I left here, journalists asked me... - You're talking about me? - Yes. - But... - It was Your Excellency. You were with me all morning and didn't bring it up. I didn't know what was being said about me around the Senate. A journalist asked me, "What do you think about the accusation?" "What accusation?" "Senator Lindbergh stated that the judge who ordered the arrest... of Senator Gleisi's husband is being supervised by you." Is it a crime to be a student or to be a supervisor? The entire weekend was full of inferences... corroborated by Senator Gleisi today at the plenary... implying I might be involved... - Wrap it up. - This is serious. This is very important. I have to defend my honor and the judge's. She's not here to defend her honor. Not here. You can't infer anything about my honor. - And you can infer what you want? - No, listen... Dr. Jana?na has the floor, but she should conclude. I'll be quick. People judge each other by their own rules. The members of PT have vassals, not students. They think other professors also demand that people kneel! My students are judges, prosecutors, researchers... of all ideological orientations. They never subjected themselves to me, they answer to me in their research. My role is to teach people to have an open mind... that's why I even supervise people who support PT. But you're judging me by your own rules. - Conclude. - You want them to be your vassals! Senator Lindbergh has two minutes to reply since he was mentioned. It's funny, that lawyer infers everything she can. She's always accusing without proof! She infers everything she can! What I said was true. She is the judge's supervisor! "Don't mess with her." Madam, you're not here for idealism. You came to this trial for R$ 45 thousand. For R$45 thousand! She was hired by PSDB Party! Now she's an idealist! Don't give me that! I told the truth. He was supervised by her! She should restrain herself. As if she didn't know what impeachable offenses are. She's always making political speeches! I can see you running for office in the next elections. Don't pretend you're an idealist. You came for R$ 45 thousand! Mr. President, no personal attacks! Mr. Patrus Ananias has the floor. Mr. President, excuse me. I found some pictures This is the march against abortion. He's fifth in the Pope's line of succession. The Spiritualists and Catholics are more active than us. - Really? - More than the Evangelicals. I didn't know. Catholics actively raise this flag... But there are pro-abortion Catholics. Some groups within Catholicism. And they're united. But some Catholics are against it. There are many groups. She's the president of the Evangelical Singers' Federation. Wow, congratulations! Those doctors who perform abortions... reach a point in their lives when they get depressed. There's a case in Mato Grosso, and I can show it to you later... of a doctor who performed many abortions. She couldn't take it anymore and killed herself. That's so sad. She was a woman and a mother and you're a mother too. Spilling the blood of innocents has spiritual consequences. Even though they say it's natural. They say it's normal, but we know there's no pact for that. That's true, that's true. - I'm your ally. - Amen, go with God. Thank you, you're just great. - You won't forget us. - Never. - Thank you - Thanks. See you later. Hi, sweetie, how are you? Sure. Why? Right. No way. It's not a problem at all. She did. None of them question her guilt, be it for not speaking or not supervising. That's the point. She blames you so she could be absolved. But don't worry about that. Stick to that strategy. It's great. No problem, kisses. The committee will start. Shall we go back to hell? - Let's do it. - Let's go. Nothing better to do. This is why we're here. August 2nd, 2016. Senator Anastasia reads his final report. We reiterate the admissibility report. We are not contrasting the President's mandate, nor her abysmal unpopularity... that spreads through all kinds of social networks... with eventual audio recordings and plea bargains, or with any conduct unrelated to her presidential duty. I vote in favor of the accusation declaring Dilma Rousseff guilty... of issuing additional budget decrees without Congress authorization... and performing loan transactions with state banks... leading her to be tried by the Federal Senate as determined by the Constitution. Anastasia... has used many accounting tricks! To fight corruption... is to fight the corrupt! And one of the most corrupt... is the current rapporteur... of the Senate Impeachment committee! There won't be a coup. We will fight! There won't be a coup. We will fight! No violence! HONK PT OUT Goodbye, darling! DILMA OUT - Do you have any paper? - Sure. We can gather up what we have now. I'll read it at home. If someone has a brilliant idea, even in the middle of the night... about what we should say, call me. Look at this piece of paper! It's a disrespect! Let's raise bullet points. I need emblematic mistakes. To discredit the report. - Like you did with Arantes. - That's it. There's no point in hammering on what people don't understand. I need to be straightforward. But these are the divergences. But what is the legal basis? He says we're taking power away from Congress... but it doesn't make sense... since Article 4 allows the executive to do so. He distorts the argument that we ignore the annual budget because it's a neutral decree. Pay attention to this part, Gabriel. You're going to e-mail it to me, but print it too. For tomorrow. Is it at 9 am? At 11 am. So print it. We'll meet early to prepare it. Let's go over the accounting tricks. I didn't read it. I'll go home to read it, and you send it to me tonight. Don't you want to go over the annual budget? No, that's his creation. He mentions a "theory of the bank teller." And he's like Plato's theory of ideas. He creates a fantasy to talk about the annual budget. The annual budget is not in the plane of ideas. The form matters little to the world, just how much was spent. God bless you, kids. Bye. Personally, I had great expectations regarding Senator Anastasia's report. For one simple reason. I know the Senator. He's a righteous man, a scholar of law. Due to the evidence and what had been proven... by the examination, witnesses and documents, I had expectations. Would he manage to free himself of his party passion and look at the evidence? Look at the law? Would he be able to use all his potential... to seek the truth instead of following passion? With all due respect, the rapporteur did not achieve that. He achieved his usual brilliance in defending his party's thesis. But he was not able to grasp the truth of the files. And influenced by his passion, not with malice or intent.. he made concessions to the evidence gathered herein. You say that our system should be called "The Bank-Teller Empire". The budget cannot be spent because it is provisioned and requires a compatibility target. That reminds me of Plato's "Theory of Ideas". In your report, ideas conquer reality. What matters to the target is not the ideal. What matters to the target is how much is spent. If we are working in the "Bank-Teller Empire", you work in the "Empire of Ideas". Where form prevails over substance. Where the annual budget leads to a President's Impeachment... even if no extra cent was spent via decrees... according to the expert's table... not the one you wrongfully indicated in the report. Regarding the accounting tricks, and I don't have time to comment... you assume it is a loan transaction. You didn't repeal my closing arguments, and you forgot the main thing. How does something not a loan transaction become one by default? Is it dialectical? Not even Hegel and Marx could explain how one legal relation can turn into another. Default begets a loan transaction. You say it doesn't happen in all instances... only between a state bank and the public administration. It is an odd case when a legal mutation takes place... outside of what is natural in the legal world. An innovative argument. And I respect those. But I can't accept criminalization of those who differ. That's authoritarian. Especially when it's retroactive. It never existed before and the evidence is very clear. Your Excellency states something that astounds me. "The President acted negligently." But the law says, that the management is not hers. You say she was negligent for it's her duty to uphold all financial laws. The President must uphold all financial laws? Then you say: "A mother who kills a child can do so directly... or can kill it by letting the child starve to death." If the mother does not have custody... if the mother was away, if she put the kid in day-care... the murder is not hers. I'd like to commend Senator Anastasia. He is a brilliant, intelligent man. It's a shame that this time his passion did not allow him... to seek justice, truth and democracy. August 4th, 2016. Vote on the final report, one day before the opening of the Rio Olympic Games 2016. This crisis has led to over 12 million being unemployed in Brazil. Not only did it offend against financial and budget laws... but also against the principle of good administration... by using intent, malice and fraud to govern. That's why I can say I am very sure of what I'm doing... and of what is best for Brazil. That's why I'll vote "yes" to the report... on Senator Anastasia, which is as clear as day. My vote is "no". Against this coup and this fraudulent report. And I shall repeat ten times. It's a fraud! I determine, as per my usual rulings... the suppression of the expression fraudulent report". Why? The opinion of each Senator is free. We can't accept, under any circumstances... that Senator Anastasia's work be called fraudulent. But that's our opinion! You can't censor our opinion. I want it to be recorded for history! When PT was called a gang, I had it stricken. When they said PT should all be in jail, I had it stricken! That's not censorship, that's balance. Yesterday a Senator called PT a criminal organization... and you didn't have it stricken. Maybe a word slipped by or I didn't see it... because I've been talking to senators... and I eventually need to use the restroom. Something may have gone unnoticed. A word for a question of order. No questions of order now! The results are: Yes, 14. No, 5. Senator Anastasia's report is approved and is now this committee?s opinion. We have 673 pages now. 673? Keep it with you because if anything bad happens... we'll file this one. Let's go, Gabriel. Just press here. Another one. Eventually you'll take it, right? Dear God. You got it? Another one. Got it? We know it is difficult, but we must fight till the end. I believe in a positive surprise to defeat the coup. I truly believe that. We can't give up. When you stop believing, we are doomed! Not believing in the fight means accepting defeat. This is a very important battlefront for us. Very important. We need to report what's happening with democracy the social setbacks... what this scenario that led us to impeachment meant... the deconstruction of PT, Lula and Dilma. It was a big deal! Of course it is upsetting to realize some people are against us. But it was systematic. The TV went into people's homes... to say we're no good, PT is no good and that we weren't in a position to govern. We allowed it to happen. It made up people's minds. 70 years ago, Get?lio Vargas had the clarity of mind we never had. Get a guy and have him start a newspaper... and make it vibrant and a weapon of the people. We chose to line their pockets with money... and fill them with public concessions. We had the Secretariat and Ministry of Communication. So we were handing out many radio and TV licenses... and giving the big media a lot of money. I'm not sure I ever told you this... but Lula's Government shut down the most community radio stations. Then it becomes difficult. It is hard to communicate with the people... unless it's election time or through the President's charisma. If we do fall, it will be mostly because of what we got right. Because we went against the interests of big money. However, it's undeniable that we made their path easier with our own grave mistakes. You have no idea how hard it was to get a PT minister... to receive the social movements It was as if they would only get in our way. Almost a pleasure to say no to our own and a sad submission to the powerful. That needs to be thoroughly addressed. Not to mention the acceptance of methods of doing politics... which we assimilated strongly and uncritically... and didn't lead us to political reform... even after the scandal that put several of our comrades in jail. All of this is part of a process that is not self-flagellation... but it's about having the clarity to break with our mistakes. August 29th, 2016. President Dilma testifies. We will now commence the testimony... of President Dilma Vana Rousseff... whom I greet for coming to this illustrious plenary... to present her explanations regarding the facts... the accusation against her. The natural judges, the senators... will formulate their questions objectively... soberly, impartially... and restricted to the accusations... in the prosecutor's opening statement. I give the floor to the illustrious Senator Simone Tebet. The decrees and accounting tricks weren't simple accounting operations... but part of a fiscal strategy... to artificially boost the primary result... and spend resources you didn't have... illegally borrowing from state banks. If Your Excellency returns to the Presidency... what wild you do to block this fiscal-hole... and win back the trust of the Brazilian people? Regarding the state banks... it's impossible to see it like that. You're criminalizing the fiscal policies. Why do I say that? Because it wasn't Brazil that went through a crisis. You claim we've been covering up this crisis since 2009. No, Senator, since 2009 we started to face... the world's greatest crisis since 1929. It started in the developed countries... when Lehman Brothers collapsed. I should remind you that in 2011, 2012, 2013... there was the Euro-Zone crisis. We didn't make the crisis up... but it hit us hard. Unfortunately, as of October 2014... the super-cycle of the commodities ended. The United States ended its credit expansion policy... three days after the second round of the elections. It created tremors that reached every currency in the world... and they plummeted. The foreign exchange crashed. We had one of the largest energy crises in Brazil due to a water shortage. Senator, I'm sorry, but to say the country's fiscal crisis... is due to three decrees... and a subsidy operation... not a loan transaction, from Bank of Brazil to fawners... is to reverse causality completely! I don't know what our world would be like... if these were the reasons for such a major crisis! I have the honor to invite Senator A?cio Neves... to address his questions to the President. First, it's not dishonorable to lose the elections... especially when defending ideas and complying with the law. I wouldn't say the same about winning elections... with no truth and perpetrating illegalities. I see that you permanently resorts to your votes... as justification for all your actions. The vote, we all know, is not a safe-conduct. This impeachment wasn't born in Congress. This impeachment was born on the streets of Brazil. So I salute the representation of the Brazilian people... made up of young, fearless... selfless, non-partisan men and women. They took to the streets to show their indignation. A coup is to win an election lying to a country. I disagree that this impeachment process... was spontaneous, from the streets. None of us in here is so naive not to know... who is responsible for admitting this impeachment accusation. The admission of the request for my impeachment... came from a clear blackmail by Mr. Eduardo Cunha... with whom you unfortunately made an alliance. And this is confirmed since I'm not on trial... for money laundering, for offshore bank accounts... or for the misappropriation of public funds. I'm a defendant at the final stage of an impeachment trial... while someone who publicly committed crimes is protected. This is something to be deeply ashamed of. It's about this, not movements on the streets. Unfortunately, those same leaders, some, not all... some of them were most emphatic and cheerful.. when taking pictures with Deputy Eduardo Cunha. In addition... This is life, Senator. It's hard. So, Senator... we can't say that this process is spontaneous. Now speaking Senator Roberto Requi?o. I will not suppress the indignation that consumes me. Bastard! Bastard! Bastard! Thus Tancredo Neves referred to Moura Andrade who declared vacant the presidency with Jango still in national territory. Thus consuming the military coup of 1964. I doubt that just one of us be convinced that President Dilma should be removed from committing crimes. It is not the "Pedaladas" or such fiscal responsibility that excommunicate her. The accuser's own rapporteur himself practiced them at length. Only, that there in Minas, there was no providential and enjoyable Eduardo Cunha. Let no one later claim ignorance or be cheated because the intentions of the Vice are clear: Privatization as a rule, and radical alienation of all the energy patrimony, mineral, forestry and agrarian sector of Brazil. After the delivery of the Pre-Salt, from the sale of land to foreigners, they even want to deliver the Guarani Aquifer, the largest reservoir of drinking water on the planet. Freeze for two decades the spending with health, education, public safety, sanitation and infrastructure, housing... But guarantee the payment of interest. It is like prohibiting, for 20 years, that children are born, young people have access to schools, that Brazilians get old or sick. It's scary that some human being have granted such a barbarity a day. Yes. It's Sophie's Choice. Exactly. It's void. No. It has to be done. Exactly. Professional. Sure. Exactly. I'm only wondering if we should do it now or right after. We could wait to file this lawsuit... and the one for lack of cause right after. Attorney Jana?na Paschoal has the floor. The world needs to know that we're not debating accounting issues. That is why I asked one of the professors: "What were your fellow foreign colleagues told... to convince them it was a coup? That the President is being removed based on three decrees? That she's getting removed because of an accounting issue? If that's so, it's only reasonable they deem it a coup. Or were they told the Brazilian people were victim of a fraud?" That's how PT works. PT denies facts and reality. We can no longer stand the politics of marketing. We want leaders who stare us in the eyes. I trust in your judgment to make Brazil better for our children. Even though I'm convinced I'm right. Even when I'm right, I realize my actions might hurt others. So, even though I'm right, I apologize. Finish your train of thought. I conclude... by apologizing to President Dilma. Not because I did what had to be done... because I couldn't omit myself. I apologize because I know her situation is not easy. I apologize because I know, even though that was not my intent... I've caused her grief. And I ask that she... one day might understand... that I also did it for the sake of her grandchildren. Please, no manifestations. I pass the floor to the eminent attorney and also professor... Jos? Eduardo Martins Cardozo. During the military dictatorship, Dilma Vana Rousseff... sat on the defendant's bench three times. She spent three years in jail. Her political rights were suspended. She was brutally tortured. Her very dignity was attacked. It is possible that some of her accusers... overcome by a fit of sentimentality, said to her: "Girl, we are arresting and torturing you for the sake of the country. For the sake of your kids and grandkids. We're annihilating your life. But it is for your sake. We are destroying and crushing you, but it is for your own good." Sometimes that happens to accusers. They suddenly grow a conscience. But they can't eliminate the injustice of their accusation. They might even try to fake a feeling of humanity. But, objectively, they fail. Today, Dilma Rousseff sits again on the defendant's bench. After the Constitution of 1988, after the return of democracy... after we affirmed the rule of law. She is no longer a girl. She is a mother and a grandmother. Today, she is a woman elected President of Brazil... with over 54 million votes. The first woman elected President of Brazil. And what is she accused of? Today we know. But, maybe in some time... nobody will remember the charges she's accused of. Much like nobody remembers the accusations of the past. What will they say? She was accused because she dared to win an election... affronting the interests of those who sought to change the country's course. She was convicted because she dared not stop... the investigations against corruption. The pretexts? Those will remain in the files. Turned to dust. The dust of time. I have nothing further to say. The files speak on my behalf. This session is finished. August 31st, 2016. The Senate votes. Madam Senators and Senators... I start this session, or, rather, resume it. The table clarifies... as it pertains to the vote in question... "yes" means you approve the conviction... that is, the loss of the President's office. Those who vote "no", vote for absolution... and consequent dismissal of the charges against the President. Senators, you may start your vote. 61 Senators voted "yes". 20 Senators voted "no". 20 "no". Zero abstentions. IT'S FRAUD! IT'S A COUP! I SHALL NOT PUT MY NAME TO THIS INFAMY. You won, but didn't take it. Because you're doing it against the constitution. President Dilma! History's already absolved you, Dilma! Fighter! Brazilian woman! Fighter of the Brazilian People! Today, the Senate made a decision that enters History as a great injustice. The Senators who voted for impeachment chose to rip the Constitution to shreds. They decided for the interruption of the term of a President who did not commit any impeachable offense. They convicted an innocent woman and performed a parliamentary coup. By approving my definitive removal... the politicians who desperately seek to escape justice... shall take power along with those defeated in the last four elections. The progressive, democratic and inclusive project I represent... is being interrupted by a powerful and conservative force. With the support of a biased press... they will take the institutions of the state and employ them... in the service of extreme economic liberalism and social regression. This coup is against the people and the nation, It is the imposition of intolerance, prejudice and violence. As I take my leave, I share with you the beautiful solace found... in the words of the Russian poet Mayakovski. "We are not happy, that much is certain. But why should we also be sad? The sea of history is agitated. Threats and wars we are bound to overcome... break them in half, cutting through them as a keel would." My kindest regards to the Brazilian people. To the women and men of my country. Specially to the men and women who share with me... a belief in democracy... and in the dream of justice in all its dimensions. Thank you. You represent me! You represent me! Dilma, a fighter for the Brazilian nation! Temer out! Temer out! Nine months later, on May 22nd, 2017, Michel Temer is formally accused of corruption by the attorney general. He becomes Brazil's first head of state to be formally charged with a crime. Temer refuses to resign. You came with us to shout "Temer out!" And "Direct elections now!" Pension reform, labor reform... and outsourcing are the continuation of the coup! Police, please retreat. This space belongs to the workers. One, two, three, four, five! Stop the reforms or we will stop Brazil! One, two, three, four, five! Stop the reforms or we will stop Brazil! Direct elections now! I can't believe the police are firing and throwing bombs at demonstrators... who came from all over Brazil in an organized fashion! Help me! Help me! They're trying to throw me out! No one will throw anyone out! No one leaves! No one leaves! On August 2, 2017, the Congress voted not to put President Michel Temer on trial for corruption. After taking office, Temer has overseen a spree of privatizations, austerity measures and spending freezes. His ruling coalition passed a radical austerity law that bars the increase of public spending for 20 years and a controversial labour reform that weakens worker's rights. Restrictions on foreign oil companies looking to drill for lucrative offshore deposits were lifted. On April 4, 2018, the Supreme Court rejected the habeas corpus filed by the defense of former President Lula. The next day, Judge S?rgio Moro ordered the arrest of Lula.
