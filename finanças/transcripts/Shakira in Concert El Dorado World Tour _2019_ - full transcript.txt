SHAKIRA IN CONCERT I love you, Shakira, I love you. I respect you, Shakira. YOU'RE MY EL DORADO Stronger. Again. Louder. A good observation. Thank you. It's been a long time! I'm so happy to see you all again and so close to me. BARCELONA, SPAIN MILAN, ITALY PARIS, FRANCE SÃO PAULO, BRAZIL Alarming news for all of Shakira's fans. If she's not cured, her career is at risk. SHE'LL NEED THE BEST SURGEON Voice and emotion are connected in human beings in such a way that you can only understand when you cannot make use of that. It was very difficult for me to recuprate without surgery, and surgery was very risky. It involved having to be without my kids for a long time, because I wouldn't be able even to sneeze after surgery. In December, I remember asking Sasha what he was going to ask Santa Claus for Christmas, and he said that he'd ask God and the Virgin Mary to give mum back her voice. Can you imagine having two kids, 2-1/2 and 4-1/2 years, and not being able to speak to them, but with a board and signs? You're unable to speak for several weeks. And there's therapy to recover your voice, and then see the results. I saw five doctors in three days. And four of them said that I wouldn't recover my voice without surgery. I had to rest my voice completely on several occasions. Day after day, week after week, I was unable to speak. Thought I'd lose my voice forever. The accident was in October. November, December went by, and I had vocal problems up to... before the rehearsals. I argued with Gerard more than ever when I couldn't speak. He kept saying that he needed me to speak, because I was mad. I told him that I would never be able to sing. I went to Lourdes and brought holy water. I did everything. I meditated. I said... I did many things. Suddenly, everything started to flow. I was back. It was like being born again. I could sing again, be on stage. There were times when I didn't think that would happen. Doctors couldn't believe it. I think I'm a better singer now because I value more my voice. I appreciate it more, am grateful for that gift. Everytime I'm on stage and watch people sing with me, with their cellphone lights on... we're one at that moment. I look at the horizon of the stadium, and thank God for having recovered my voice. Thank you. Let's do it again. YOU'RE THE SOUNDTRACK OF MY LIFE A little kiss, Shakira. I got you dulce de leche. Do you like it? Are you serious? And alfajores. -Thank you. -I welcome you. The audience is pure adrenaline. Every night... what I mostly enjoyed was watching the faces of the audience. I remembered them all. The day after I'd meet someone who was at the concert and I'd say: "You were there, right?" I love you tons. I think that on this tour there's been an awesome connection, almost a... metaphysical connection. Extremely intense. WE LOVE YOU SHAKIRA, I LOVE YOU During the show, what I and my fans experience, is more exciting. We go from a song with rhythm to a romantic ballad. I feel that my audience gets on board without any problem. They go on that trip to wherever it takes them. "Wherever, Shaki. Here we go." YOU'RE MY EL DORADO I can't find a middle ground, I don't have it. I wasn't given that switch. The audience is like me, we are alike. I love you so much. I feel that I get them, and they get me. I have the best fans that an artist can have. And now this song that was "inevitable" not to sing. "Shaki, we're in the studio, and it's yours." We can do whatever we feel like doing. We can go wrong, we can do horrible things. This is my space. No one is going to say if what I do is good or bad. I'll explore. I love that. It's my favorite. I don't know. He could also join me in a phrase. I love that melody, start the rap, but don't know how to sum it up. The end. I'll wash your car. After all the things you said, I'll do it. It's very dirty. Another idea. Nothing too structured. I set the rules. I don't fail. I told Gerard that I didn't have time. That it was better if I retired and took care of the kids. They need me now. He said: "Work, I won't have you bickering, because everyone will be out there creating music and you'll be in here, raising kids. No, do your work." Like this. Let's do it another way. Love the masochistic part. What it says is good. The lyrics are good. It needs a music drop, right? The result will be... Kids, look what I got. Look, they're my new little ears, with monitors. Sashito and Milan. My kids thought I was a tennis pro. It was the only thing they saw me do. Every day. "What did you do today, mommy?" "Play tennis." They saw me in the recording studio, creating music. For them it was a revelation, a discovery to know that their mommy had been singing since before they were born. "But how come? Mommy, you existed before we did." They've been in the front row. Maternity pulls me in. It pulls me, pulls me. At times, I only want to be with my kids. They've understood. When I explain to them what I do, I tell them that many people have listened to my music since they were children. They've grown with me and when I go to their city, they feel very happy and make a huge effort to go to my concerts to listen to songs they've shared on many occasions. That I feel a great joy when I'm on stage and make them happy, and whenever they go to my concerts they say: "Did you see all those people? How they sang and danced." We all have problems, difficult situations, but at that moment, we forget everything. We sing, dance, smile, and that's the most beautiful thing in what I do. I think the show is at an ideal point. Six months ago, I thought it was my best show ever, but now I think it's better than what we had, because we've had time... to polish it, to add more things. What a disappointment. To begin a stadium tour is a great challenge, because many things change. I'm not good at dealing with changes. I take time in adjusting to them and the longer, the worst. Obviously I have to adjust to these spaces which are bigger, vaster. My little wings which I have to interact with the audience... Fifthy thousand people, the Aztec Stadium. Only two nights. One of the greatest pleasures in this tour has been my being able to go through all of my work. Songs like "Ciega, sordomuda" were left out, out of respect for the public so that they wouldn't kick me out. I think a two-hour concert is enough. It's the longest concert I've ever done. I started when I was 18, doing shows of 1 hour and 15 minutes. I remember that my brother had to carry me out, and now who'd have thought that I'd have so much stamina after dancing and singing for 2 hours. The audience's energy is what fires me. The concert ends, I still keep on dancing, and cannot go to sleep until 4 a.m. I start with "Estoy aquí" which I wrote when I was 17. Also songs like "Antología." One of the first songs I wrote. It's called "Antología." This is like a madhouse. Bogotá, November 2018, last show of El Dorado Tour. I love you, Colombia. I'll always remember this moment. ¡We love you, we love you, we love you, we love you! Us human beings want a meaning to our existence, our life. Understand why we're here and for what reason. There has to be a reason. And we're doing the last concerts, the last one, really, to raise funds for a foundation which I created in my country called Barefoot. I was born and raised in this country where there's so much social injustice, so many poor children who are condemned to live in poverty. We're arriving at the Colombian jungle. And we'll be visiting the first Barefoot school there. I'm very excited. The only way to achieve equity or pave the way to peace, is by offering a good education to all children, boys and girls. This is nice. Your name is José David? It's a very good drawing. The government has an obligation to children, but the private sector also has an obligation to give back a little to society. As long as there are children in poor conditions, who are not being given the same education as others who have better living conditions, we cannot talk about a peaceful country, we cannot talk about equality in a country. We're all committed. Everyone who takes has to give, and if we're here and do not help each other in the survival struggle, it makes no sense. Getting there is okay. The trip. It's been such a full and inspiring trip because of all those wonderful people. The experiences were difficult. There were obstacles, challenges, and they all made me stronger and also more appreciative. Human beings have to lose something to realise how fortunate they are. I never imagined at my age and after so many years singing, that I'd be so much in love with music and my fans. Now I don't want to stop, and it's a bitter sweet sensation to be happy and sad for something that's ending. Part of me is sad and another part is happy because I'll be with my kids all the time that they need. Even Milan said that the other day. "Mom is sad because the El Dorado tour is over, but is very happy because she'll be with her family." How are my people? Thank you. My flip-flops are great. We're going to the spa. Sexy, sexy, sexy. I was like this. Making an effort, turning on, trying to turn on before going on stage. And it's no use. I come out and the audience goes... That's like... Thank you. Thank you. Love you tons. Thank you for having me closer to the people. It was a grand finale, my love. You're the greatest in the world. I love you. He's got Cuban rhythm. Let's switch. Someone explain, because I don't understand a thing. He's married to a caleña, so that explains everything. Everyone is taking their clothes off. She gave me an extra kiss, one more than you. It's over? Now back to being a housewife.
