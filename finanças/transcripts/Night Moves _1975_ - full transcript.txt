Beep! How I hate these goddamn machines! This is Nick, babe. I got one for you, Har. It needs a real live detective and not one of our computers. There's a lady called Arlene Iverson - ...1536 Sunset Plaza. She's lookin' to get her daughter home. She's an old friend of mine - used to be in the movies. Maybe you remember. If you take the job, stop by the office tonight. I'll give you what stuff we have on Arlene, okay? Bye-bye, poops. These two match, but I'm not sure. Where's my old lady? Your old lady's in the office. Be careful! That's ivory! Good hands. Ohh... It's too late now, Mr. Eben, as it has been too late since Monday. Wha- no, look, I-let's - let's just forget the whole thing, past, present, and future. I'm sorry! Goodbye! What brings you across the tracks? Oh, I just have to go visit one of the... Beautiful people. Oh? how'd you get to meet one of the beautiful people? It's one of Nick's handouts. Have you had any second thoughts about joining his agency? Mnh-mnh. that's not an agency. That's an information factory. I'd go bananas there in one week. Can I get some cash? Yeah, it's right there. You gonna be late tonight? Oh... I don't know. Why? Charles and I are going to see a Rohmer film - "My Night at Mauds." Wanna come? I don't think so. I saw a Rohmer film once. It was kind of like watching paint dry. Shall I come back? No. Is she taking it? She wants to see it in place. Charles... When are we going bowling again? You seem to get some weird kind of satisfaction from this sort of thing, don't you? Are you the kind of detective who, once you get on a case, nothing can get you off it - bribes, beatings, the allure of a woman's body - that was true in the old days - before we had a union. Well, my daughter Delly - would you believe "Delilah"? My husband was a film producer who wanted to produce biblical epics. - Well, she's gone. - How long gone? Two weeks. I'm used to her staying out nights, so at first, I didn't worry. How old is she? 16. You got any idea what she does with her spare time or... Oh, yeah, she, uh - she hangs out with freaks. She smokes marijuana. Gets laid, I dare say. You have a name for any of these, um, freaks that she hangs out with? Yeah, a creep called Quentin. I called him, and he told me Delly had left town, told me not to bother him, and he hung up. Well... You have an address for this Quentin? Yeah. I'll need a picture of Delly, preferably one taken in natural light. Mm-hmm. This is my second husband, Tom Iverson, the bum. The only thing I got out of him was a new name. That's after I quit acting. Did you ever see me in anything? Well, I was never... Big - not really big. There are a lot like me - you know - studio premi√©res, studio romances, not much talent. But I got lucky and grabbed off one of the big guns, Irving Grastner. Oh, I had lovely tits... Even if I do say so myself. They're sitting on a little bit of silicone now, but when they were up for grabs, they were really something special. Delly didn't do so bad either. All right. Go find her. Well, let's say $125 a day and legitimate expenses. You can get cheaper. Can I get better? You're hired. Well, for them that don't have football, there's always religion, right, Har? You ever miss it? Not a bit. You ought to get your money into those guys. They're appreciating faster than real estate, especially now that the Mexicans got their backs up about their art treasures being ripped off. Excuse me. I hate to tell you what this little piece of crap is worth. Don't you like 'em, Har? I would if they didn't all remind me of Alex Karras. Yeah, here it is - the tape on Arlene. She likes big guys. That ever buy you anything? Arlene and me go way back. Arlene Iverson - maiden name, Carson, age, 45, born Scottsdale, Arizona, October 3, 1927.

Nice meeting you. Likewise. Hi. anybody home? Yeah, up here. Why don't you watch it downstairs? That thing will kill your eyes. Who's winning? Nobody. one side's just losing slower than the other. What's wrong? You have a hard day? How was the movie? Pretty arty. Did Charles like it? He thought it was yummy. We had a bite to eat afterwards. Hmm. Can you come downstairs and watch the game? Yeah, I'll be down in a minute. Harry? Hmm? I'm gonna make some cocoa. You want a cup? No, thanks. I'm fine. Hey, Quentin... Are you Quentin? Who's lookin' for him? "Moseby Confidential." What kind of bullshit name is that? Oh, it's not so hot, I guess. At least it doesn't have an eye printed on the card. I'm looking for Delly Grastner. Delly isn't around here anymore. You got any idea where she could be? Is she visiting friends? Is she meditating? Did she join a commune? Delly's idea of a commune is her and a guy on top of her. When's the last time you saw her? Screw off, mister. Hey! what is this?! What happened to your face? I won second prize in a fight! Where was the last place you saw Delly? In new Mexico. I went down there on a job! A movie location - something for Warner Bros. Delly went with me. One of the stuntmen - Delly started hittin' on him. When I left, she stayed on. What was the stuntman's name? Marv Ellman. Is he the one you had the fight with? Any message if I run into Delly? Just be drivin' a truck. Yeah, they really get to you, don't they? Can I help you with that? I can manage. I'm going your way. What is this? I'm Ellen's husband. I'm not surprised. I thought Ellen would tell you sooner or later. Why? That's the way she is. She didn't tell me. I saw you coming out of a movie. How'd she take it? I haven't spoken to her. You haven't spoken to her? What's this about? I wanna know what I walked into. Ask your wife. Hey! Let's pretend I'm asking you. How serious is it... ...you and Ellen? For me, it's not too serious. For Ellen, ask her. I'd be guessing. It seems to me, you're the one it's serious for. I'm beginning to get you in focus, Moseby. You know, Ellen talks a lot about you - about the kind of guy you are, about what a great athlete you were. But you were different. You were brighter. More sensitive. Stick with you and Ellen! She told me you were left by your parents when you were very young and brought up by relatives - knock off the goddamn crap! I don't wanna know what she told you about me! You should. It's a clue, isn't it? Isn't that what you do - look for clues? Didn't you track down your parents and find them, "Mr. Keen Tracer of Lost Persons"? You sure you weren't trailing Ellen when you saw us?! Well, take a swing at me, Harry, the way Sam spade would! Why didn't you come to me? I wanted to see what he looked like. Well, are we gonna talk about it? It's your ball. Run with it. Oh, don't start with the sporting metaphors. I couldn't stand that. T- this isn't something we can pretend doesn't involve you. What is this "We" bullshit? I didn't get caught fucking Marty Heller. Why did you go to him before you came to me? Because I didn't wanna be lied to. How do you know I would have lied? You've been doing a pretty good job of it so far. Why didn't you come up to me outside the movies when you saw me with Marty? That would have really been terrific, wouldn't it? I stand there with my thumb up my ass while you introduce him as some client or some faggot friend of Charles. But then, when I came home, then you wanted to trap me, make me incriminate myself. Then you could go get the evidence, like I was one of your crummy divorce cases. It's a wonder you didn't photograph the bed! You're really prime, Ellen! You know that? I catch you screwing another guy, and you attack my lifestyle! Your lifestyle has nothing to do with it! It's a joke! At least the job Nick offered you had - I don't want Nick's fucking job! Any more than I want your job! I like doing what I'm doing! Doing what?! People ask you to do boring, trivial, sordid things, and you do them, and if that weren't good enough - oh, turn that thing off! I can't hear myself think! Lucky you. Harry... ...I think if you'd asked me, I would have told you. Yeah? Yeah, well... ...we won't know now, will we? Keep it coming, Marv. Leave the cars. Get the bag up good and high. Keep firing in the police car. Hit the smoke, Joe! Hit your smoke, Marv! Smoke! Crazy son of a bitch! Fly that plane! Beautiful, Marv. Hey! That's pretty good. Very good, boys. Here we go. How was that, okay for you? How's that for you? Jeez! He flies good. Crazy bastard. He does everything like that. Guys like Marv make me feel old. Well, I am old. I'd say we saw the same movies. Hey, aren't you the Harry Moseby who played ball for Oakland? Yeah! I saw you in the pro bowl. What year was it, now? Uh, '64? '63. yeah, we lost 17-21. Yeah, yeah! You made the interception against that big running back. Now, what was his name? Willy Hazel. Willy Hazel. Big, big mother! Hey, that was a great move. Yeah, it stuck pretty good. One of these days, Ellman! Up yours! She was only around for about a week, I guess. Wouldn't you say, Joey? - It just seemed longer. - He didn't approve. Listen, Delly has had it rough enough up till now. She needs you like she needs a third leg. Joey's okay, except he likes to play Delly's daddy. See, the thing is... Me and Arlene - we got it on together a couple of times. There's nothing like having a mother and a daughter. It gives you sort of a kind of... Perspective. Know what I mean? What about the guy she came with - Quentin? Oh, that weirdo. He's a magic mechanic, all right, but he's a freak. He got pissed 'cause Delly was turning on to me. Tells me to stay away. Next thing I know, he throws a punch. I knocked him down a couple of times. Joey came in and rescued him. I was telling Harry about the fight. The kid should have had a pipe wrench to even things up. Did she say where she was going when she left? Just lit out. Didn't even thank me. Well, if that's it, there's a little lady over at the bar, needs a fellow like me to buy her a drink. See you, Har. He'd fuck a woodpile on the chance there was a snake in it. Hell, it ain't easy, Harry. I tell you, I know Arlene from a way back, when she was married to Tom, and I watched that Delly grow up from squirming around on guys' laps to - well, studs, like that Marv there. And it ain't the most cheerful thing I ever saw. You think Delly knew that Marv and her mother were making it? A blind man on a galloping horse would have known. Arlene ain't Lillian Gish. I'm sorry! Hey, listen, you don't mind having your drinks spilled by a sweet little ass like that, do you? Hey, pops, what were you drinking? Here, let me buy you one. You tell me. Is that... Rye? With water. And the same for my friend here. Yes, sir. Shit! Would you believe me, letting a kid like that get through to me? Some days, you know... Hey, kid. Kid, it's okay. Okay. You know, I've been doing this thing most of my life, and all I got left to show for it is a muscle in my arm, my camper, and two ex-wives who wait for the postman every month like it was the second coming. And the world is getting smaller, the kids are getting younger, and I am getting drunk. If you like, you can sleep in my camper. Thanks. I'll take you up on that. I'll see you, Joey. Thanks a lot. On your way, huh? What's Quentin doing down here? Oh, we ran into some trouble on the stunt plane. Oh, what is it with that Ellman?! He drives this thing like it was a truck! The brakes are gone on both wheels, I had to change one of the tires, there's chips on the prop! Hi, Quentin. Well? How long will it take you to get it flying again? For Marv? Right now. Shit! Gotta keep him and Marv apart, and still finish the gags on this picture. You think you got troubles. I gotta go back to L.A. and see the black widow. Well, keep your legs crossed. Hey, you ever see Tom Iverson? Uh, it's been about a year, year and a half. The last I heard, he was taking tourists down the Colorado river on rafts. He's another guy that can only do one thing, and that has gotta be crazy. We ought to have reunions. See you back in the smog. Hey, let's take in a ball game when you get back to the city. Caught me in my bath. I'm sorry. Oh, that's all right. You could have joined me. It's a big bath. Maybe some other time when I'm feeling really dirty. I ran into a friend of yours down in new Mexico. Oh, really? Who's that? Marv Ellman. Oh. how's Marv? Where do you know him from? Around the house. In the bath. He was one of the stunt guys who used to hang around the house when I was married to Tom. Was Delly around then? She was just a kid. How much of a kid? Oh, I don't know - 11, 12. And she was jealous of every one of them. Hey, what's it all about, Moseby? Delly had one of your scenes with Marv Ellman in new Mexico. That dirty son of a bitch! Where's Tom Iverson? T- Tom?! What's Tom - what's Tom got to do with it?! I think maybe she's trying to even up the score. I don't know. The last I heard, he was running some dumb charter boat down in the Florida keys. How long ago? Six months. Would Delly have any way of knowing that? I might have mentioned it. My guess is that I should go down there. Y- you're going to go all the way to Florida on a guess. No, I'm gonna fly all the way to Florida on your money, Mrs. Iverson. That's up to you. Go ahead. I thought you said you'd wait till I got here. I had to stop by the office. Then you're going to the airport. The plane leaves at 11:00. You just got back this morning. The girl I'm looking for may be down there. Couldn't that wait a day, so we could talk? I can't work up much enthusiasm for talking... After hearing it all played back through Marty. Why'd you have to talk to him - about my father - all that? I was trying to describe you to myself, not to him. I was trying to remember what I admired and loved about you. You sure picked a funny place for it. Oh, the hell with it. Let's not make such a big deal out of it. You were screwing around, you got caught. Happens all the time. Not to us. Go tomorrow. One day can't be - Ellen, either way, I have to go. Why?! So you can pretend you're solving something? There's notice of a rising barometer and prevailing clear weather. That indicates no precipitation will be falling over south Florida. Hello! Yes? This is Tom Iverson's place, isn't it? That's right. He's not here just now. We're closed for the day. You got any idea where I can locate him? He may be here tomorrow. What's it about? I just wanted to ask him a couple of questions. You sound like you might be the police. My name is Harry Moseby. I'm a private investigator. Tom's stepdaughter, Delly, is missing. Ran away from home. I'm looking for her. You got something to verify that? Yeah. What do you got 'em for? Well, there's a big demand for dolphins. Lots of people want them. You'd be surprised. People buy them for their swimming pools. They think it's chic to have a dolphin for a pet. Like that craze for baby alligators in New York, years back. When they got bored with them, they flushed them down the John. Now they got a sewerage system swarming with blind, albino, shit-eating alligators. I'm not too sure I believe that. You're not one of those intent-on-the-truth types, are you? Well, not religious about it, no. But I, uh... Delly's here. What, now? This very minute. Hey, where are we going? Over there. If you wanna swim, it's a mile. If you wanna follow me, it's 6. I'm burning a lot of oil, so I'd stay well back. Okay. You gonna tell her who you are? I don't know. Is she liable to, uh, take off? Not before she's tried to lay you. She's pretty liberated, isn't she? If we all get liberated like Delly, there's going to be fighting in the streets. Hi. Hi. You been down here before? Pretty funky. There's been some great storms. Feels like everything's gonna blow away. I really like that feeling, you know? How old are you? 40. I guess you like things to stay the way they are. It depends on how they are. I like things to change, no matter what. Is that Tom? It ain't Lindbergh. I'm here to pick you up. Did you tell her? No, I, uh, I thought I'd wait and talk to Tom first. We've got a visitor. Huh? who is it? Thanks. I don't know. Por nada. are you gonna take me swimming tonight, Tom? I don't know. I wanna go. You thought I was bald, right? How long have you been on the keys? Long enough. And you don't like it? I like the sun. I'm convalescing. What from? A terrible childhood. My father used to blow his nose with his fingers. That'll do it every time. Anyway, down here, I'm a pretty good-looking chick. You don't think so at the moment, but stick around. Okay, start em' burnin'! You mind if I ask what the setup is? Are you with Tom? Is, uh, Delly hanging it out for Tom? What are you with all these questions? You some kind of detective? You are kind of edgy, aren't you? It's the heat and the low wages. Eee-ha! come on! Give me a ride! Whoo! Home is the hunter. Home from the hills. The sailor home from the sea. Get yourself a drink, Harry. Oh, I got the grill! How about you eat mushrooms, and I'll eat your steak? The greatest part of the world. Damn right. Oh, hell. If I go up on the mainland now, I get nervous. I gotta come back down here and put my tank on, go out and sit on the bottom for half an hour... Just to get my head straight. Listen, is there still much smuggling going on around here? Do dogs have fleas? Cuba's only 90 miles away, and it's getting closer. Hell, there's always a buck to be made. How are you, uh - how are you figuring on getting her to go back with you? Oh, it's simple enough. There's just one complication. What's that? You. Me?! why? You're her stepfather. You can be back here with the cops, and I - oh, hell, you aren't going to the cops, are you? Well, that would be my next move, yeah. Oh, hell! You don't have to go that far. Well, I've come to take her back to Arlene. Oh, yeah, but the cops - my god, she's just a kid. She been giving you any trouble? What kind of trouble? Trouble you wouldn't want the cops to know about. Well... she, uh... Harry... you're a pretty straight guy. And I'm gonna tell you - I want that kid the hell out of here. You see, I, uh - I got pretty foolish with her and I... And - well, you've seen her. God, there ought to be a law. There is. Hi. Hi. I'm getting you settled in. Thanks. Where do you want this? I borrowed your shirt. My clothes were wet. You know, I read in a book once that, when a man sits in a chair like that, he's afraid of women. It sounds reasonable enough to me. Is chess hard to learn? This isn't easy, believe me. I brought you some ice. Thanks. Want a drink? Sure. Mind if I use your shower? Mine doesn't work so good. Be my guest. Por nada. Did she offer you the key to the city? Well... no, it was, uh, more like a sightseeing tour. How do you resist? Oh, I just, uh, think good, clean thoughts like Thanksgiving, George Washington's teeth. You beating yourself? It's a position from a game played in 1922. Do you play? I know the moves. Well, black had a mate and didn't see it. Queen sacrifice... And three little knight moves. Check. Check. Check. That's nice. I'll bring your shirt back in the morning, okay? Show me that again. Aw, it's a beauty. Yeah. But he didn't see it. He played something else and he lost. Must have regretted it every day of his life. I know I would have. Matter of fact, I do regret it, and I wasn't even born yet. That's no excuse. You guys have a good day. See you tomorrow. Did you come to get your shirt back? No, no. Okay. No, I came to tell you that I'm a private detective... Hired by your mother... To take you back to L.A. Are you kidding? No, I'm not. Well, you can forget it. I am not going back to that bitch! I'm afraid you don't have much choice. Go screw yourself! Delly! Delly, you're either gonna go back to L.A. with me, or I'm gonna turn you over to the cops... hey, Delly! What's wrong? This old pervert keeps flashing on me! Go away, you fucking bounty hunter! You're not gonna earn anything off of me! Kill that son of a bitch! Ugh! She doesn't want me. It's the money. I know Arlene. And so does Tom. He hates her as much as I do! He's my stepfather, and unless he says so, I'm not going back! Where's Tom? He's gone out. When will he be back? I don't know. He gassed up for the whole day. Why? I want to get Delly - I want to get her on a flight to L.A. today. I'm not going back unless Tom says I have to. I know what he's gonna - Paula, did you hear what that son of a bitch... Ah, well, what the hell. Who's in such a hurry anyway, right? Why didn't anybody ever tell me? There ain't nothing I can do about it, Delly. You gotta go back with him, and that's all there is to it. Bullshit! Hi, Moseby. Oh, god, do I need that. Take Delly out swimming tonight, will you? Sure. Did you come out to make sure I didn't swim away? No. I just came out for the ride. What happens if we just keep right on going? You'd end up in the Yucat?n. You been there? Not yet. What did you do before this? This and that. I taught school... I kept house... I waited tables... I did a little stripping... I did a little hooking... And I trod a lot of water. Sounds kind of bleak. Or is it just the way you tell it? Do you ask these questions because you wanna know the answer, or is it just something you think a detective should do? I just want you to know I'm here. Did you know that... Sharks can never stop swimming because they don't have any flotation sacs? I didn't know that. Stick with me, kid. It ain't much fun, but it's educational. Harry Moseby, isn't it? Right, first time. Okay, folks, I guess this is as good a place as any. Uh-huh... tropical fish! It's the Alaskan finger fish. It's very rare. And that's the dorsal view... Look at those sharks after you, swimming. You're worried about sharks, with Delly in the water? Well, I guess I'll have to just tough it out. That's right. Come on in! Your little girl's waiting for you, Harry. Do I really have to? Agh! Paula! What is it? Quick, Paula! Stay there! - Do you see her? - No! Slow down the boat! What is it?! Do you see her?! Jesus god! Look at that! What? What is it? Oh, my god. Oh. Aaah! Delly! Delly! Aah! aah! Aah! Aah! Stop talking. Here. Ohh! Come on. Got it? Get the water out of her! Hold on. The fish! The fish! All right. Come on. The fish ate his face! Take it easy. Good girl. You're okay. She'll be fine. I saw his face. What was that? Marker for the coast guard. Poor bastard. Can you manage her? Yeah. That's right, just one - the pilot of the plane. Yeah, I left a float for a marker. That's right. Sure. Listen... You took my phone number, so you can call any time. Okay. Nothing they can do tonight. They'll have to go out in the morning. Ah, boy. You know, this is a bad area for - for accidents. It's like that stretch up the other side of Miami - devil's triangle - did you ever hear of it? They got more missing planes and boats than you can count. And I don't mean little planes, either - Navy planes, military, big ships, tankers - you name it - all up the whole coast. I wonder how long he's been down there. Well, won't know that till they bring him up. Where you going? To my room. Sleep down here on the couch. You'll be more comfortable. Tom, let her go. No. Attagirl, Paula. Sleep well. Party over? Tom couldn't last the pace. You had a very funny reaction to - out there. I guess it was seein' the dead guy. Where were you when Kennedy got shot? Which Kennedy? Any Kennedy. When the president got shot, I was on my way to San Diego, to a football game. When Bobby got shot, I was sittin' in a car, waiting for a guy to come out of a house with his girlfriend. Working on a divorce case. One of those times I wish I was in another business. Why do you ask? It's one of those questions everybody always knows the answer to. No. It was that poor bastard in the plane. I remember Bobby when he got shot. The newsreels - they made it look like everything was happening underwater. The first time anybody touched my breasts, it was a boy called Billy Danruther. The nipples stayed hard for nearly half an hour afterward. Don't you think that's sad? No. I think it's kind of nice. I don't. I think it's so fuckin' sad. I come from a small town. I grew up in a small town in upper New York state. Malone - do you know it? You should - it's part of your heritage. Benjamin Franklin slept there. You remember Ben Franklin - he's the one on the $100 bills. Please. Oh... oh. Harry Moseby, isn't it? Right. Right. Wha- it's all right. It's all right. What's the matter? What's the matter? Hey, hey. It's pain - it's all right. It's all right. Come on, now. It was all... You're just having a nightmare. I want to go back to L.A. tomorrow! Can we? Promise? Sure, I promise. I promise. Go to sleep. I like being patted like that. It's supposed to remind you of before you were born - your mother's heart beating on your back. Do you think you can remember back that far? Listen, Delly, I know it doesn't make much sense when you're 16, but don't worry. When you get to be 40, it isn't any better. Did you ever run away from home? No. No, me and my parents, uh - we had a different arrangement. I think people are shitty. You're okay. Hmm. Yeah. Yeah, I'm an Ace. Paula? Hi. Um... How are you? You gonna be all right now? Hey... You sure you won't need us for the coast guard? Oh, I don't think so. Paula ought to be able to tell them all they need to know. Well, we'll be seein' you. Thank you. Oh, that's all right - you deserve it. I'm very pleased to have Delly home. Tell me, did you have much trouble persuading her to come back? No, not a lot. It was easier than I thought. How'd you know she was home? Delly called me from the airport - get up! You don't care what you drop Delly back into, do you? Somebody says, "Go find my daughter," you find her! Somebody says, "Go spy on somebody," you do that! Quentin! Quentin! You're worse than the fuzz! They're upfront about what kind of bastards they are! You stay the hell - get out! Are you satisfied, man? You've brought another happy family together! Come on! You little - those are the new advent speakers? What is this, Moseby?! They fill the room nicely. What game is this?! It's no game. I just, um, I just wanted to see you. Did you have to come out here and break in?! I thought I did, yeah! I think Harry would like me to leave. Well, I don't think that's necessary. I think Harry thinks it is. Harry thinks if you call him "Harry" one more time, he's gonna make you eat that cat. I'll wait on the deck. I'm back. I'm gonna give up the agency. You don't have to do that for me. It's not for you. I'm doing it for me. Why did you change your mind? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Do, uh... Whatever you want. These seats are shit! Last year you got great tickets. Every year you're out of the league, they move you back 10 rows. You still serious about wanting to get some stunt work? Oh, I don't know. What the hell?! That job I offered you is still open. Hey, I just finished getting an extra's card for Delly. For Delly? How come? Arlene asked me to try to fix it up. - Where do you know Arlene from? - Way back. What's your name? Joey Ziegler. I don't think you were one of the names. What names? One of those she cheated on Grastner with. I'm one of a small, select group. We hold meetings in a telephone booth. Bonjour, private eye! It's your last case speaking. Have you found any more little, runaway girls? Harry, I want to talk to you about something. I think you might be interested to know who - How are you, Harry? I'm fine... Lousy. You know. Yeah, I know. You really giving up the business? It looks like it. How you been? More lousy than fine. Yeah. You're different. Am I? Mm-hmm. How? You seem very remote. No... I'm just thinking about... Things. Anybody I know? No. not even anybody I know. My old man. Was he really so unlike you... When you met him? I never met him. But... I thought... You stayed with him. You told me - for a week. Well... You know, I was really pretty proud of myself, the way I tracked him down. I followed all the clues... Followed him from job to job, from city to city. I finally found him in Baltimore - some rooming house... On hibiscus Avenue. I went up to the door. There was a little card there. It had his name on it. Then somebody pointed him out to me. He was in the park, on a bench, sitting there - just a little, old guy reading the funny pages out of the paper... Mouthing the words with his lips. I just sat there for a while and watched, and then... Went away. Why did you never tell me this? I don't know - just something I wasn't terribly proud of. Hey. Standing 6 feet away from my father, and then just walking away. Trouble is, after the first 6 feet, it's hard to tell whether or not you're jumping or you're falling. We've taken a long time to get this far. I don't want to pour it all away. Please. Please. Harry! The girl you brought back from Florida - what was her name? Delly Grastner. Why? I just heard on the radio - she's dead. I'm sorry. Oh, god. Okay, roll it, please. You know, this wasn't even a stunt, just some silly-assed keystone kop gag. The green car - that's Delly and me. The stunt. We didn't kill a goddamn chicken. There's been a wreck! There's been a wreck! And it's real! oh, my god! Help! Somebody! That's the "B" camera - another angle, same stuff. Is that Quentin? Sure. we had some trouble under the car - muffler or something - and he went in and fixed it. What is that camera there? Hmm? oh, that's some, um, cockamamie student 16-millimeter documentary or something. That's Delly and me again. It was around that... Corner that it... It was so simple! Is there any other film on the accident? Yeah. Yeah, the kids got some part of it. I'll have 'em roll it for you. I don't want to see it. Will you roll the 16, please? Yeah, I can understand why you didn't want to see it. Well, it just reruns itself in here anyway, so... Look, Joey, um... Could Quentin have - now, forget why he'd want to - could he have futzed that car? You mean when he was underneath? Well, any time. No, I don't see it. Look, Harry, I did it. I was the driver... The fuckin' driver. Harry... The thing is, the kid seemed so much better when she came back... Like she - like she got it all together more. Did you notice that? No. No, I, uh, never saw her after I brought her back. I had a call from her, but I wasn't in. Hey! Hey, Joey... Look... Take it easy, huh? You're lucky you didn't get wiped out with her. That's not the way it happens. You heard. That's right, Mrs. Iverson. I heard. Is that why you're in mourning? Get out of here, you son of a - you get it all here, don't you, Arlene? What?! You get it all. What's that supposed to mean? That's supposed to mean that I don't like you, Mrs. Iverson. Delly never had a chance with you as a mother. She was on a downhill slide right from the start. So, I'm not grief-stricken. What does that make me? You know, Delly isn't the only kid who ever had it rough. W- when I was her age, I was down on my knees to half the men in this town. I'm sorry the poor little bitch is dead, and, when the time comes, I'll cry for her, but you won't be around to see it, Mr. Smartass Moseby. So, uh... Out. Out! What are you doin' here? What happened? It was an accident. I saw it. What do you want, Moseby?! Somebody murdered her. Who? I don't know what you're talking about, man. The only one that gets anything out of Delly dying is Arlene. Then how'd she do it? Who helped her? You're crazy! I don't know what you're talking about. Why were you at Arlene's house when Delly got home? Delly called me from the airport - what about?! About Ellman. The stuntman? Didn't she tell you? What about him? She didn't tell me anything. That was Ellman in the plane... On the bottom. That was Marv Ellman? Yes. Why didn't she tell me? I was right there. Because she figured you did it. You futzed the plane! She was crazy! She thought I still had it in for him, - but I didn't do it! - You killed her! What would I want to kill Delly for?! Because she figured out you killed Ellman! Marv Ellman dead? I called Florida. God damn it! They never reported the plane to the coast guard. Why?! I still can't get over it. He was a crazy son of a bitch, but he was a hell of a guy. Does Tom Iverson know Quentin? Yeah, sure, they've both been into stunt gags for years. Sure, Tom knows him. There's no other explanation. Quentin is tied in with Iverson. They didn't report the plane in the water. Ellman's plane, your car - two dead. Quentin! I still don't see the connection. My bet is he's in Florida... With Tom. Let me know, huh, Harry? Mr. Moseby, your flight is boarding at that door. I hate airports. I'll be back, uh, no later than Friday. Mm-hmm. There's something wrong there. I can figure it out. Then tell the police what you know. Oh, god. Decided not to? I don't think this is going to solve everything. But if you didn't go? Now, look, I know you've been alone a lot, even when I was around. And I know when you get... When we get like that, we reach out for other people. Marty was a... Distress signal. Fortunately, we were passing by - I didn't mean just you. I know what you didn't mean. You're gonna miss your plane. If you don't go now, you can't come back. Please hurry, sir. Thank you. ...Key west is calm. Throughout the region, on the Gulf of Mexico, the winds continue south by southwest, changing to southerly by morning. The barometer reading... another tank? ...and rising. ...anticipated high for the day in the low 80s. where's that other regulator? It's right there. Look for it. Okay, bowline. Let's go. ...not expected to... Hello, Harry. You killed Quentin, didn't you, Tom? Pain in the ass. He came pushing around, threatened to go to the coast guard about Ellman. He wouldn't believe it was an accident! Talkin' about Delly, the cops! I didn't want to put - watch the propeller! Aahhh! Goddamn fools! Tom! No! Jesus! Come on! You ridiculous - Cut it out! That's enough! Aahhh! Oh, my god! Tom! He's still breathing. If you want him dead so much, why don't you kill him?! Fuckin' fools! Hit! hit! What the hell is goin' on? I want to know, god damn it! What the hell - don't we all?! Cut that out! I've been listening to your ping-pong talk long enough! What was in Marv ellman's plane - drugs? Was it drugs?! No! no drugs. We were smuggling in something from the Yucat?n. It's a piece of junk worth half a million, according to Tom. They've been flying it in piece by piece. The crazy bastards have been at it for months. It's crazy! The whole thing - crazy! Where is this half a million dollars' worth? It's out there - over the shelf, out past where we found the plane. All right, come on, let's go. You mean you're gonna solve the case and find the Booty? That's right. Can you dive 80 feet? No. Then you're lucky to have me with you, aren't you? Get on. Come on, Harry. We're gonna catch the sunrise. What were you getting out of it? Me? oh, some change... A little more fuel for the flight... A bus ticket for the next stop after key west. I got into it because I got involved with Tom. I got involved with Tom because... He was the only man around who got nicer as he got drunk. It may not sound like much to you, but, believe me, in these parts, it's a good deal. That night after we found the plane, Tom went back out there, didn't he? That marker you left - that was for him, not the coast guard, so he could move your piece of junk away from the plane. And you kept me out of the way. Something like that. You told me fairy tales... About Malone... ...Billy Danruther... The president getting shot... ...your erect nipples! What does it matter, Harry? I want to know what it's all about! I told you! You - what the hell are you all about?! You're asking the wrong questions. Why don't you just be content? You've solved the case. I didn't solve anything. This... fell in on top of me. Why don't we just keep on sailing, Harry? Why not? There's the marker. It'll only take a couple of minutes to go down, but it may take me a little bit longer to get your boodle up. Why don't we let the coast guard do it? Scared I'll try to make it to the Yucat?n underwater? Paula! Get out of the way! Paula! go down! Go on down! Paula! Swim way! Get out of the way! Get out of the way! Shit! You bastard! Bastard! Bastard!
