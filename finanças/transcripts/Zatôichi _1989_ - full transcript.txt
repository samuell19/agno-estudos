Take your food quietly. Thank you. Take your food quietly. Thank you. Take your food quietly. Oh, thank you. I'm sorry about this. I'm being pursued for being critical of the government. Really. But I have allies all across Japan. Oh, I see. When this world becomes ours, what we're doing will be right. So rest easy, masseur. I will make this a good world, I'm sure of it. I'm called Tsuru. I'm Ichi. Eighty and five... Eighty and six... Eighty and seven... Eighty and eight... ZATOICHI What could have happened, really? Something that strange shouldn't happen. Welcome home. Is there someone here? Good of you to come, Ichi! Hey, come on in, you've come just in time. I was going to eat it by myself, but it tastes better with company. Oh, thank goodness. Come in, come in, the wind is so strong. Well, I thought you might not show up, sir. I had waited there the whole time. I had waited there the whole time. Sit over here. It's been a while since I heard the sound of the waves, it's refreshing. The official said, "A blind man can't be a thief." So I asked, "Who decided that?" He responded, "I did!" I got ticked off, so I took his jutte. Then he screamed "Thief!" And chased after me. I was confined for three days, and given one hundred lashes. Well, if you get hit that many times, at least your shoulders won't get stiff. Yeah, the stiffness in my shoulders is all gone now, I feel refreshed. If you stay in a cell for too long, then it kind of turns into your home. Except the lock. The difference between your own house and a jail cell is the lock. In your house, the lock is on the inside, and you secure it. A jail cell is locked from the outside, right? If you can lock it, then it's not a jail. If it's locked from the other side, then you are in the cell. In that case, I'm glad that your house doesn't have a lock! Not locking the door is part of how I am. Oh, Mr. Ichi, stand up a moment. Now now, turn that way, turn that way. There you go. I made this to give it to you. What do you think? Is this silk? That's right. The measurements are just right. Oh yeah, there's one more thing I need to give you. But this is such a nice kimono... Do you remember this money? You left it here some time ago, I kept it aside so I could give it to you. I left that money for you, so you could use it. You left it for me? Yeah, that's yours. Oh, I see, then thank you. So is it really mine? That's right. All right. In that case, I will give it to you again. Now, take it. Today is a good day for payouts at the Tenjin house. Use that as collateral, and be sure to make some money! See if it's odd or even, go and try it out! Thank you very much! What are you doing, hurry up! Young men nowadays are... Thank you for coming all this way. He's still young, so I'm thinking of teaching him the business. This was used by the government during the chaos caused by Amakusa. It's an antique. Antique guns are one thing, but men don't become more valuable overtime. A man just gets older. But you let that old Torazou control you... ...I can tell where you'll be in the future. You take control. For today's celebration, I brought twenty guns. Boss, the other guests besides Boss Torazou have arrived. Hail Lotus Sutra, Hail Lotus Sutra... Chou! One and one, Han! One coin. I lost. Mr. Ichi! Mr. Tsuru! Are you starting the revolution in here? I feel like I've gone blind. Having eyes where there aren't any, that's gambling. This is not an influential era... ...like before, when we forcibly gained control from the populace. The truth of the matter is, if we took away everything they've got... ...it would ruin our lives also. We have to think about the future. From here on, we have to work together, and be friendly. Goemon is still young, but please treat him as an equal. I used to change his diapers when he was little. Greet them! The people who live in this business of ours eventually have to spill red blood. Work together and be friendly with everyone? You're joking! Treat each other as equals? Well, that's fine. If there are people who are my equal, then I will treat them as such. Hey, wise one. How dare you talk to your elder that way? He's not my elder, or anything. You bastard! Don't underestimate us! Now, now, let him say what he wants to. Make it quick! You killed a lot of people, and made a lot of people cry when you were young... ...in order to widen your territory. Am I right? How I kill someone, how I make someone cry, that's all my choice. I have problems dealing with antiques, you know? So, gentlemen, I will take care of your business from here on. If any of you have a problem with that, bring it on. Oh, Tenjin! Man, that felt good. Nice speech. Well, I'm the only one here who's your equal. How did it go? Did you take care of it? Well, go and take a look. As long as you continue being the local authority, Mr. Hasshuu... ...I'll help you out, no matter what. As long as I continue to be the local authority, eh? Are you a fool? Do you think I'm going to hand this position over to anyone else? I'm going to send bad people to hell, and I will walk the path to heaven. I'm going higher than heaven! How about it, want to come with me? You said you would help me out, but what kind of help? Excuse me. Ohan of the Bosatsu Family is here. Hello. Miss Bosatsu, what took you so long? I apologize for being late. Well, Master, it's been a long time. How's everything? Fine, thankfully. Oh, that's good to hear. Thank you very much. Why don't you sit here, I'm leaving anyway. Hey! Get the tray for the boss of the Bosatsu family. And bring up three warmed bottles. Hasshuu is here. Yes, sir. Right away. Hasshuu? As in the local authority? It seems like it. Why would Mr. Hasshuu come to a place like this? If he stops by at a gambling hall, he'll make good money. I'm sorry we're so late. Oh, no. Where is the Younger? Well, he is upstairs, with Mr. Hasshuu... Has there been any trouble? What? Oh, no, not at all. This is my thanks. Oh, thank you, you're always thinking of us. What can I say to repay you? If there is anything I can do with my body to satisfy you? Thank you. Excuse us! Please... Excuse me. The dice are going in. Ready. Bosatsu, if only you could have gotten here sooner. I'm sorry. We have received a generous gift from the head of the Bosatsu family. You are the only person I lower my head to. Hasshuu is waiting. Four and six, even number! I am Ohan, nice to meet you. I am... Lord Hasshuu. Bosatsu... Hey, hey! I'm going to raise a drink with this one! I will make you one of my followers. What do you think? Our world has become a good one, hasn't it? For a government official to be able to drink with a gambler. That's it, that's what's so amusing! If you become one of my followers... I, Ohan of the Bosatsu, cannot become one of your followers. I am sorry. Chou. Chou! Chou! Is there any player betting on Han? No Han? No one's betting on Han? What's going on? All of the players do what that fat blind man says. Everyone is betting the same one, there's no contest. This game is a draw. I'm going to roll the dice. Please make your bet. Everyone, make your bet! Now! Make your bet! Han! Han! Han! Han! Han! Han! All right, is there anyone betting on Chou? Anyone for Chou? Are there any players for Chou? Anyone for Chou? Bring a box. House bets with a box. Here we go! Four and three, Han! Fool! If this keeps up, this won't pass for gambling or anything else! But as long as our customers are happy... Please let me roll the dice once. You want to roll the dice, do you? Well, my eyes aren't so good, but I'd like to try anyway. This is the cup. And the dice are here. Okay, I've got it. What's this? The dice of the Goemon family have the character "five" instead of dots. As you can see I am blind, please forgive me for my clumsiness. Come on, let's do this! Mr. Ichi! All right, go ahead. Thank you. Chou! Chou! Chou! Chou! Is anyone dropping out? They are all accounted for. Here we go! Here we go! Four and six, Chou! By the way, everyone, I don't have a marker, but I have money. Would someone bet against my sixteen ryo? All right, I'll take it! I'll take it! Okay, then, let's split it then. Half each, right. Let me bet, too. Move! This is big! I'm betting for Han! This will be the next throw. Has everyone bet? Yes, everyone has. Is there anyone dropping out? It doesn't look like anyone is dropping out. If no one is dropping out, then here we go! Go! Five and one. That's Chou, so I win. And that's enough for me, thank you very much. You're in luck! Thank you, I'll be going now. Thank you so much. Show us those dice! You just swapped them, didn't you? Here are the dice. You were cheating, weren't you? Cheating? Don't joke. Your dice have a "five" character and these don't, so they are mine. Well, excuse me. Hey, come here. Come here, here! Feed him to the fish! Bastard! Your boss's character comes through when his underlings act like this. What did you say? Please stop. You guys certainly have been saying some strange things. I was watching earlier, but... ...isn't the rule to bet with your marker on the dice in the cup? Isn't it? This isn't an amateur's place, after all. You bet on the dice that landed outside the cup. I have never seen nor heard of such a stupid gambling parlor as this. Right, Younger? If the customers here are treated in such a manner... ...we won't be able to see our business through to fruition, correct? Hey! Fools! Sir, we are so sorry. There are so many guys who have no idea what they're doing. Well, thank you. Give him a lantern. I'm going to become a man that's untouchable... ...even Hasshuu can't tell me what to do. Here you are, a lantern. A lantern for a blind man? Please take your time. We've made preparations. It's a dark night tonight. Thank you for your kindness. Hey, you! That's as far as you go. It's one step from the River Styx. And they said that it was a dark night. What about it? Try and get me already! There's someone else there, right? You're Zatoichi, correct? My father has told me a lot about you. Oh, you're the head of the Bosatsu. You helped me out at the gambling hall, and this is how it ended up. They're the ones who drew first. I've never entered the bath with a man before. But why would you, someone who dislikes men... Ah, this man cannot see, after all. But you can see what I look like in your mind, right? I see her... Who do you see? My mother. How old was she? Twenty-eight. Then she's the same age as me. The same as you, Boss? Call me Ohan. Boss... Sorry, I mean, Ohan. You've let me see such a wonderful thing... This must be what they mean by paradise. I lost my vision when I was two... ...so the last time I saw her, she was still twenty-eight. That's why, no matter how much time passes... ...in my mind's eye, she never ages. Now, she's younger than I am now. If she were alive, I might make her my wife. It's hard... I wonder if this is what they mean by not wanting to leave someone. I love you. I love you. The speech you gave at the attack of the Iioka... Do you remember that? We of the Yakuza... ...are gamblers who walk the forbidden back-streets. The ones most hated in the whole world, so to speak... No matter what happens... We have to see our business through to fruition... Even a woman like me will put her life on the line... ...and see her business... through to fruition. Yes! Yes... Yes! And you'd be happy just sinking into the water... For you to live in a place like this... Don't fool with me! What is it? You said something like "don't fool with me" just now... Did I say that? It must be my stomach grumbling. It is rumbling. What is? Your stomach. No thanks, I'm a warrior, I don't take handouts. This is for your stomach, not you. I'm grateful. This is delicious! It's got beans in it. Let me paint you. Huh? A picture. Act normal. Just normal, don't do anything. Try holding your cane in front of your face. A little further away... That's good. Don't move! Hey, what are you doing? Move! You're in the way, move! Man, there are so many different colors. Is there red? Yes, there are many kinds of red. Do you like red? Yes. What kind of color is it? Huh? It's like the evening sun... ...or a woman's lips. I was wondering... ...if you could tell me which way the tavern is. This is a very high-up place, isn't it? Yes, the view is wonderful! And the wind feels so nice! The dumplings are good for you. Because you could use them as eyeballs. Miss, let me have some dumplings. Mr. Ichi! Mr. Ichi! I'm so happy, I didn't think we'd meet again so soon. Mr. Ichi, ever since we parted ways, I'd been thinking about it. I wanted to pay you back somehow... Then I met these masseurs. I thought that I could be their guide! Mr. Tsuru, that makes me very happy. We're heading up to the Kasamori Kannon to pray in the morning sun next. Everyone, this is my best friend, Mr. Ichi. Nice to meet you, I am Matsunoichi. I am Takenoichi. I am Umenoichi. I am Suginoichi. I am Kuroichi. I am Harunoichi. Mr. Ichi, how would you like to come along with us? There's no need to hold back, even though we're not acquainted. How about coming along with us? Thank you, but I have something I must take care of. Perhaps next time. Well, if you'll excuse me. Farewell, take care. Thank you very much. Here is your food. Oh, here it is! Well, that certainly made my day. Mr. Ichi, here. This is spiritual water from Mt. Kiyosu. They say it's good for washing one's eyes. Here, take it. Mr. Ichi, the next time we meet, you better greet me first! Are you the one who wants to be the bodyguard? Any letters of recommendation? We have a policy of not employing samurai who don't have recommendations. Where were you before you came here? I don't talk about where I've been. Look at my face and decide. I'm expensive. Expensive? I am an instructor of the Onoha Single Blade Style, Sukezaemon Kuroma. I challenge you. Come. Draw your blade! Go ahead. Mr. Kuroma... Thank you for all of your hard work, what an embarrassment! Thank you for the meal. Thank you very much, please come again! Burdock root, please. Yes, sir! Here you are. Come on in! Come on in! Thank you forthe meal. Thank you very much! Give me two bottles of sake. Okay, two bottles of sake! I got it. Come on in, are you staying the night? Yes. You're lucky, we have a nice room. Thank you. Ah, come on in! Come in! Bring me the check! Yes, sir! All right, Jongara time! Jongara, jongara, jongara, jongara! Jongara, jongara, jongara, jongara! Jongara, jongara, jongara... I don't care if I die! Bring it out! Now everyone, please come here! Now, I'm going to sing the Jongara Bushi! So please listen well! The shamisen is great! The neck is even better! Ah, when I was a child, my young heart... The song I learned when my mother carried me on her back... That's the Tsugaru Jongara Bushi! That's it... That's red. Red? Yeah. This is red... Right! That is the red you like so much. This is red? Well, you've done well to find it out. I think that this is red. All right, let's have a drink! Hey, drink up. Come on, why are you holding back? No, I... This is my room, so I'm not holding back. That's why I'm telling you to start drinking. Now, drink up. All right, let's play Scissor-paper-rock? The one who loses has to drink. The one who loses... Paper-scissors-rock! Oh, I lost. I lost. Paper-scissors... Paper-scissors-stone! Man, I lost again. Paper-scissors... Wait, wait. Paper-scissors-stone! I won! Damn it, I lost... Well, I have no choice... I lost after all, I have no choice. The liquor you are forced to drink tastes even better... Man, this has kick. Are you happy, not being able to see? That's the first time anyone has asked me that. Do you have any problems being able to see? Pretending not to see something, I guess. I cannot see, but have to live as if I could see. Your problem is pretty extravagant. Do you look into mirrors? Yeah. I've always wondered if my face was being shown in it... This is a memento of my mother. She always used it. She used to tell me someday I would see my face in this mirror. Do you want to see it? Can you see it? Sir, the red has become much deeper... Sleepy Ichi, Ichi of Tenma... What the, you're already asleep? Yes. Your eyes are closed all day, how can you sleep? Aren't you going to sleep? No. I'll rest well when I'm dead. Are you leaving? Yes. Thank you for taking care of me. My bill, please. A samurai paid it for you earlier. Are you all right? Yes. Please come again. Hey bird! Hey, hey! Mother Bird! You left your baby here... Mother Bird! Left, left, left, left, left! Don't go right, it's dangerous! Left, left! Left! Left! We told you to go on the left side! Big Sister! We're home, Big Sister! Our guest fell into a hole. The egg is going to hatch. Hello. Nice to meet you. I happened to meet the children of this house, and came to say hello... Please come inside. Please! Please, please! I'm so hungry. Hurry, let's eat. My tummy is empty. Shall I help you? All right, everyone, let's eat. Join us, Mr. Ichi. Thank you. Thank you forthe food! Let's eat! It's hatching! It's hatching? Is it hatching? It's hatching. What's written on it? Hmm? A leaf is falling... A falling leaf... "A falling leaf does not hate the wind." "A falling leaf does not hate the wind"? Huh, I understand... But what is that? It's written on your bamboo pipe. Huh? A falling leaf does not hate the wind. It's that gentleman. But the falling leaf does hate the wind. Please make it nice and clean. Understand? Nice and clean! Just a little more. They're not here yet. Idiot! Yes, sorry... Well, Boss, what a gorgeous day, isn't it? Because of your good deeds... ...you're able to meet Lord Hasshuu on a fine day like this. They say that someone is planning to attack the Tenjin family... The travelers who come to this inn say that... A rumor, that's just a rumor. Laugh. Laugh! Laugh! Laugh! That's better... As they say, "Hasshuu will come to a gate full of laughter." Laugh! Laugh! Laugh! Laugh! Come on, laugh! Laugh! I said laugh! Laugh! Laugh! Stop laughing! If you come back with Zatoichi's head, I will give you an extra 150 ryo. For a samurai, that's a nice piece of business. It's good business! These days, a samurai can't get a huge amount of money like this. From here on, it's going to the age of guns! Battles will be decided by who has more guns! Those are what the shogunate used during the uprising of Amakusa. They are antiques. Then the value of these guns will increase, even if they're not used. It sure will rise. All the way to the sky! You and me, we made this place the way it is. Don't give it to anyone. Be sure to maintain control. But it'd be fun if there were a struggle. What are you saying, Kane? You are a coffin maker, so you hope someone dies! I knew you would say that. But think about it. Akabei has gotten proud, gotten big. If he gets any bigger, then try carrying a gun or even a cannon. No one will be able to take him down. And we will lose. The old Akabei wasn't like this. That's right, I can't believe he's ended up like this, really. This is because of that merchant, Juuemon. Welcome! Hey, has anyone strange shown up? No, it's been nothing but regulars. There was a masseur. He worked on me, and it was relaxing. Isn't he staying at Oume's place? Prepare for thirty people tonight. Thank you very much. Sleepy Ichi, Ichi of Tenma... Sir! It is you. I was just thinking about you, sir. What are you talking about? Earlier, you paid for my room and drinks, and I couldn't even thank you. I found a despicable color. Huh? Gold. It's a color that makes people bad. But it has a nice ring to it. Where are you from? Kasama. I'm going to go back to my homeland. Want to come with me? Let's stay together again. When that happens, you have to call on me. You could try sleeping, but I don't think it'll work. Be well. Sir! Yes? The falling leaf does hate the wind. One gun for twenty ryo, thirty guns for six hundred. Add around ten ryo, will ya? You've turned quite the profit with these guns. I have business with this jutte! It wants to tie you up. I say buy, this is the time to buy. Something like this only appears to have no value. If you see something you like, you might be able to sell it for ten ryo. Can it be sold for so much? Five ryo? Don't mess with me. "Being stupid" and "playing stupid" are different things, sirs. It's fifty ryo. It's fifty ryo for one gun, so for thirty guns... Fifteen hundred ryo! How much did you sell them for? I didn't. The buyers said that they had never seen such antiques. They wanted them so much, so... ...I gave them some. What about the bullets? Bullets? You can't shoot a gun without bullets. Want any? Hmm? I can't sell them to you, but I can give you some. Well, it all depends on what you do next. The plums have blossomed, but the cherries haven't yet... We sold thirty guns, but he left out that there are no bullets. He'll give me some if I want them? Man, he's a government official, and he's overcharging the Yakuza. What a joke! Hasshuu said, "The plums have blossomed, but the cherries haven't yet..." Didn't you say last year, that next time he came here, he could take Oume? It's about time for a change, even for Hasshuu. Laugh, laugh, they said. That's not the kind of thing a person wants to deal with. It's natural for them to get angry. What a dislikable person. I say break, now is the time to break with him. If we can break with him with fifteen hundred ryo, that would be a deal. It's time for a change and a new boss. And even Lord Hasshuu's heart... Who is the new boss going to be? Anyone would be fine. There can't be anyone worse than what we have now. And if that doesn't work, we'll find a new one. Yes? Miss, what is your name? My name is Mari. That's a name that makes me want to eat you up. I'm Jin of the Tenjin House. Is everyone together on this? If everyone here agrees, we will help you, no matter what. If we start to move, we will do it thoroughly. We won't leave a single person alive. Well, we've bought thirty guns, so please use them. Thank you for coming. There is a message from the former boss, Goemon of the Tenjin House. Please look over it. Sir, they want you to capture Ichi the Blind... ...and hand him over to them, with no reason given. Who does this guy think he is? Are you saying that Ichi the Blind has been to this inn? This is bad. This Ichi the Blind guy is said to have cut down forty to fifty guys in an instant. He's a master of the quick draw. The masseur from Iioka, huh? The cooper said that he got his shoulder massaged... I wonder if it's that guy... Try writing it one more time. I did it! You did? Wait, wait. Not yet. One more. You mustn't write on someone else's. What should I write? Stop that. Big sister! Oume! Get out of my way! Is there a masseur here who massaged the shoulders of the cooper? Is that you? Huh? The cooper told me all about you. Our boss says that he just has to have you massage his shoulders. Shut up, you little brat! I'm Genta of the Namazu family, the ones who run the inn! Please come to meet our boss. If the head of the Namazu family has called for me, I will be there. I see, so you'll come? I'll come by tonight, then. Is your mother always in your mind's eye, Mr. Ichi? Yeah, she's there from time to time. What was she like? She was like a bodhisattva. A bodhisattva? She was like you... ...like a goddess. Mirror... I've never seen one before. I look like her. Mother! You can have that mirror. It was nice that you were able to see your mother again. Come in. Thank you very much for calling for me. Please, come in. Is this your first time to this inn? Yes. I'm a traveling masseur, my name's San. Not Ichi? I'm just plain old San, as in "one, two, three." Well Zatosan, massage my shoulders. Oh, masseur, thank you for coming. I took you up on your kind words, and came here, yes. Boss, I talked to him. I'm going to start working now. Lord Hasshuu is going to take Oume tonight, no matter what. That poor girl. At her age, it will still probably hurt. The poor girl... Boss, you're really stiff around here. After we kill him, they'll add a bonus of three ryo. She'll be happy if I buy some beautiful kimono for... ...yourself? I think of you as a candle. As your body melts, the world is illuminated. Right? And I've been told to capture Zatoichi. There's nothing we can do with the government officials, right, Genta? That's right. Masseur, if you happen to meet Ichi the Blind... ...tell him to come to me right away. I won't let anyone lay a single finger on him in this inn. Good work... Good work... Oh yes, good work. Thank you. It was great. Thank you very much for letting me work on you. Save me... Throw them. Yes, sir. Boss! Boss, save me, I'm still alive. Please don't kill me... Boss, please... Boss, I'm alive. And now, you're dead. Do you know what I'm thinking now? I'm going to get Zatoichi on our side, and then raid Goemon's household. If you're going to be in this business, then use you gotta use your head! Sir! Your heads. Boss, it looks like Oume has made up her mind. Bring her to Hasshuu. Yes, sir. I'm sorry to be so late. Thank you for waiting. Here you are, Lord Hasshuu, I've brought Oume. What was that? Hey, eat. Thank you, thank you Well, Lord Hasshuu... Uh... Eat it! There isn't a single thing that Hasshuu's yakuza can't get! Are you turning on me? Huh? You idiot! Huh? Lord Hasshuu, I hope you have a good time tonight. The plums have blossomed, but the cherries haven't... Have you ever had a pleasant memory? Your life must've been hard for you. What's this? What is this dirty little mirror? I will give you good memories, bad memories, anything. How about it? This is the time for Akabei to be replaced. I can do anything. Watch me... Just watch me! Pick them up! Yes, sir. Pick them up! He tried to bribe Lord Hasshuu. And he turned his blade on me. So I exercised capital punishment on him for his two offenses. Nothing's wrong with that, right? Where are you going? I'm going to give you a lot of good memories. I'm Hasshuu. If you're afraid of Hasshuu, you can't even go to Kyushu. Mr. Ichi! Zatoichi! The children are waiting for you. Your head is worth a lot! In the midst of today's bloodbath, I'm going to take your head! You men can't be trusted. They are here! They are here! W-Wake up, Boss! Boss! Get him! Where is he? Search thoroughly! Yes, sir! We've got Akabei! Hey, Akabei. You should just hand Zatoichi over, you fool. Pulling dirty tricks like this... How could you throw my men to the bottom of the valley? Have you guys ever heard the phrase, "A small fish caught up by the current?" It applies to this guy. There's no saving him! Lord Hasshuu! Lord Hasshuu! Kill him! The guns, where are the guns? Just shoot him! Where's Ichi? There's no way he could be here, fool! Find him, you idiots! Yes, sir! Save us! Osato! Osato! Osato! Osato! Osato! Osato... Your mother is here. Osato! Osato! Osato! Osato! It's over! It's over! The one who drew first was you.
