You can always count on "The Onion" to get the story. It's America's Finest News Source.

And the Surgeon General is taking steps to address the problem. As a result of the rampant spread of obesity in the U.S., the government has been forced to raise the definition of obesity from 55% body fat to 90%. The move, which reduces the number of obese Americans from 200 million to 185 million was widely applauded from coast to coast.

But is this young singer sending the wrong message? Kip Kendall reports. Her new album, "Come with Me", has gone quadruple platinum and made her a household name. * Baby, when we kiss my heart just skips a beat * * And when you hold my hand oh, I can hardly speak * * Oh, yeah, I'm down on my knees... But some concerned parents think Melissa Cherry's image in music are too sexy, setting an inappropriate example for their children. So, what do you say to all the concerned parents out there? Well, Kip. I honestly don't understand what all the fuss is about. My music isn't about sex. It's about being a girl. And having fun. But clearly the song "Down on My Knees", Melissa, is about fellatio, isn't it? Ew! It's about how like, when you have a big crush on a boy, sometimes you get down on your knees and like, beg for their love. * Don't tell much stuff I need to show... What about your first big hit? "Take Me from Behind"? "Take Me from Behind" isn't sexual at all. It's about love's sneaking up on you, you know? Like from the behind? You know, it could be a boyfriend's love sneaking up on you? Or a friend's? Or even Jesus Christ's. * Take me from behind * Oh, yeah * Oh, yeah * Mmm, oh, oh, oh * Oh, when you love me * You know that I don't mind * You know * What I really want is for you * * to take me from behind, Yeah.. Let's talk about the song, "Lollipop Love". "Lollipop Love" is a kind of love that is just really sweet and you just kind wanna like, lick it, you know? And suck it. * Lollipop * Hey, yeah * Lollipop * Love lolli-la! * Love lolli-la! Hey, baby * * Lolli-lolli-lolli-lolli pop, pop, oh * * Lollipop Love Like a lollipop! What about the song "Shoot Your Love All Over Me?" That's about, how like, when you're in love, you just want to be covered in it. * Oh, drown me in a milky sea * Love all over me Clearly, the video seems to be tell a different story. What kind is that? The kind with ah, cum shot. I'm a virgin! How would I know what a facial is? Sometimes, I like dressing up sexy in my videos but that's just my way of celebrating being a woman. You know, people are always gonna try to tear you down, but that's their problem, not mine. Because I know who Melissa Cherry is. She's just a good, old-fashioned country girl from Monroe, Tennessee.

Welcome to "Focus on Film" with Kenneth Garber. Hello. We are now a good way through the film. So, we thought it would be a good time to get some perspective on it and joining us to provide just that are Nicholas Van Essen and Raymond Marcus. Offer us, if you will, your take on how the film is doing thus far. Well, I'll have to say Kenneth, that I am very impressed. Sketch after sketch, we're being treated to a... brilliantly biting skewering of contemporary social lores. I mean, this is poignant social satire in the grand tradition of-of Jonathan Swift and Mark Twain. Humph. Well, Raymond what do you think? I'm sorry. I must strenuously disagree. - Ah. This is nothing but vulgar, low-brow, potty humor thinly disguised as satire. It saddens me that "The Onion" has stooped to this lowest, common denominator, pandering to the masses. - Humph. Well, now for a third opinion, lets go straight to the source. We have with us here in the studio, a very special guest. Welcome, The Masses. So, what do you think of the film? It's pretty cool so far, I guess. That "Cockpuncher" dude is awesome. Bam! Right in the balls. Oh, and Melissa Cherry. She's fucking hot, right? They need to do more cool shit like that. But this part, with this film expert assholes, boring! I mean, why do you even have this two gaywads in the movie for, anyways? Fags! Loser 'em. Let's get on with the movie, dude. Party! Woo! Yeah! Fuck yeah, you fucking faggots! Yeah. Food for thought. Well. Back to the film. Gentlemen, experience the majestic splendor of a cruise aboard the luxurious Queen Nathan II. On the Queen Nathan, there's so much for today's gay men to enjoy. Shuffleboard. Exquisite cuisine. Monster cocks. Grab a pole and go deep sea fishing. Work those muscles in our shipboard gym. Enjoy our world class spa, or take a thrilling Las Vegas-style review. Yes, whether you want to scuba dive, get blown, or play blackjack in our glamorous casino, the Queen Nathan II is what you're looking for. So climb aboard the Queen Nathan II. That-that-that is not right. That's not right. And now is time for "Little Known Racial Stereotypes." Yes, everyone knows that Italians are all monsters. And Native Americans are all drunks. But did you know that blacks love taffy? It's also true that Eskimos run all the locksmith shops. The Irish have enormous nipples, and Puerto Ricans can dangle from steel beams for hours at a time. Damn, that's unbelievable. How does he doe that? Uh, he's a Puerto Rican. Also, did you know that the Dutch enjoy speaking with telemarketers? It's a special credit card offer? Peruvians love to swoop in and save the day at the last minute. And they can shoot laser beams out of their eyes. And of course, all Arabs are terrorists. Ah, stereotypes. Can you imagine a world without them? According to a new U.N. factoid finding mission, the African mission of Liberia, is about the size of Tennessee. The mission also found that Liberia is home to 200 species of birds, including the bee warbler. A bird only slightly larger than a bee. Okay! That must be our final player. Hi, Julie! Hi. Welcome! You house is so lovely. Oh, thank you! Come on in. Everybody, this is Julie. Pretty cute, huh? Have a seat. So I understand this is your first who-done-it party? Ah! You are going to have so much fun! Okay. With any luck, by the end of the night, we'll figure out which one of us did the dirty deed. Anyone of us could be the rapist! I'm sorry, did you say "rapist?" Yeah, yeah I did. Don't this things usually revolve around um, um, murder? Yeah, Julie, see, we do this every few months and frankly we were getting... a little bored with murder so I was like "I don't know, isn't there some other violent crime we can re-enact?" And I'm in the store the other day, and I find this. How fantastic is that? So anyway Julie, since you are new, lucky Julie, you get to be the victim. Okay? So once you put this on. Hop up. Okay, so here's what's gonna happen. The lights are gonna go out, so you lie down on the floor we're all gonna come running in but you're gonna be unconscious. So you stay down there. Don't you think this is a little... sick? Oh, sweetie! It's all in fun. No one's actually raping you one. I mean, You wouldn't have a problem with a murderistic game, now would ya? No, I guess not. Yeah, so why would you object to a game revolving around a lesser crime where no one even loses their life? Wait, it's just a-- Oh, it's just a jest! Come on, guys. Let's play the game. Get your cards, okay. Is it in? You got that on, sweetie? Okay, get down the floor, get down the floor. Ready for a raping? Oh, no! Please don't rape me! Come on, you bitch!

The handsome, young, Ivy league, fraternity brother who's used to getting what and who he wants? Um, the prisoner, just released on parole? That's me. - You look nice. - Thank you. Or, the vaguely hermaphroditic night nurse from the senior center just down the block. Uh! It's so creepy! Okay! Come on. Let's play, let's play. Okay. Who's got an alibi card? - Uh! - Anyone? I've got one. Oh, okay. I was with my wife, besides, that bitch has been making up stories since she was four! You can't believe anything she says! I don't doubt it! I have 22 fraternity brothers who will vouch that I was with them. Oh, I bet you do! Okay, time to spin! Whoa. Julie. Uh? What? I know this is your first time, but you're not acting very raped. Okay. Oh, no, no, Julie. You can't stand up, you just been raped! Uh, yeah, the rapist has shattered your pelvis with a baseball bat. Um, I'm leaving. Wha--? What? Where are you going? Shouldn't-- Come-- Julie! What? Now, what? I guess you guys are just gonna have to rape me. Not me. Taffy. God-fucking blacks! Uh! The nation's anti-tobacco lobby won another victory today, when Congress passed legislation restricting smoking within U.S. borders, to a single room in Iowa. Traffic was backed-up from Nevada all the way to Iowa, as smokers tried to get to the lounge. Move the car, you old, fucking bitch! Smokers from across the country are making the long journey to the ten by ten smokers' lounge in Des Moines, Iowa. I drove all the way from San Francisco just to sneak a smoke-in on my lunch break. I'm supposed to be back at work in ten minutes. It's 37 hour drive. It's fucking bullshit.

But all that's changed now that I'm clean and sober. You know, I never knew how amazing life can be without the haze of drugs. It's the little things like... ...smelling flowers. Humph.

The nation's rapidly growing prison population, which recently passed the 20 million mark, has created a severe overcrowding problem. In an attempt to alleviate the overcrowding, the government announced today, that a random selection of U.S. households will be asked to take prisoners into their homes. Hi. Uh... I'm Dick. Thi-this is my wife, Sarah. This is our daughter Ally. And this is our son, Bobby, he's ten. Welcome. To our home. What's up? Oh, come on, bitch! Don't drop this shit on me, bitch. Lift! Lift!

I'm joined by Kwame Roberts, President of the National Coalition of African Americans, and James Nakatami, Director of the Asian American Alliance for Equality. Mr. Roberts, let's start with you. Your organization is not pleased with this film's depiction of African Americans. Oh, that is absolutely correct, Kenneth. Uh, we are just about halfway through the film and we have yet to see a dignified portrayal of a person of color. So far, we've only been shown as um, vicious criminals or sex fiends. Just take a look at that last sketch. So, what specifically is your group demanding? Either the filmmakers put a positive black role model on that screen in the next ten minutes, or we will be organizing a nationwide walk-out of black moviegoers. That means every single African American currently watching this film, will exit the theater. Mr. Nakatami, are you equally unhappy? Thus far, there are maybe one or at the most two, three Asian faces in the film. How do you feel about such gross under representation? Um, me no rikey. Excuse me? Me, no rikey. Aren't you the guy who played Long Duk Dong in "Sixteen Candles?" Uh, me no rikey. And... ...back to the film.

Our job is to deliver to the American people, fair, balanced, hard-hitting news. In this crazy world, "The Onion" may be the only news source that people can truly trust. Oh, don't be so naive, Norman. This is a business. Listen to me. I know you're not gonna want to hear this, but the suits of Global Tetrahedron want you to open up Friday's broadcast with a slightly different lead story. Wha--? But Friday is the day Azmenistan gave Sloravia as a deadline for pulling out of the Uzbagiyak region. That's also the day that "Cockpuncher" opens.

It's now time for our weekly, inspirational portrait. This week, Brendan Laroux story. Brendan Laroux's story is one of dreams. As a young boy, he wanted to become a dancer. But at the age of 12, he lost his legs. Now, this would be a setback for any youngster. But while his lack of lower limbs may have stopped him from walking, they didn't stop him from pursuing his dream. My whole life, playing pro hockey is all I ever wanted to do. And I was determined to do whatever it took to make it. From age seven on, I practiced... every day. People said I was crazy. They said, you know, only people with legs can make it in pro hockey. But I didn't let the naysayers get to me. In 1988, a 12-year-old Brendan got his first big break. When he joined the Moose Jaw Bearcats junior boys' team. People said the only reason I made the team, was because the coach felt bad for me. You know what? That only made me more determined to succeed. Two years later, that determination would once again be put to the test when doctors informed Brendan that... he would have to have his wrists removed. For that young man it was, a difficult but inspiring time. Without my wrists, there was... nothing to keep my hands attached to my arms, so. Even though my hands were fine, I... I lost them, too. Now, Brendan may not have had as many hands and legs as the other boys, but he more than made up for that with hard work and sweat. He quickly moved through the junior ranks. And in 1997, he got the call he'd been waiting for his whole life. The coach said, "How would you like to be Pearl Hockey's first legless, handless player?" And I said, "Coach, I'm your man. I'm your man." It was an inspiring night. Full of... inspiration. Then, two days later, Brendan found out that his rib cage was backwards, leaving the spine exposed. That he needed a complete, muscle transplant. The risky surgery lasted 720 hours. Brendan came back better than ever. Brendan persevered and was selected MVP. Just when it seemed like the dark clouds had finally passed, Brendan contracted scurvy, went bankrupt and his wife was... eaten by wolves. He was also molested by his uncle Jerry. Today, Brendan's journey has opened the door for many athletes who never would've been given a chance if he hadn't broken down pro sports physical ability barrier. Athletes like Emma Heathcoat, cerebral palsy sufferer and three-time National Equestrian champ. Blind stockcar driver, Bobby Templeton. Deaf Olympic sprinter, Craig Connors. Gil Sereman, the world's first professional comatose diver. And of course, Chicago's shooting guard, Herby Cohen, who was born with Judaism. Yes, none of it would have been possible without Brendan Laroux, a true, inspirational portrait. In adult entertainment industry news, the nation's porn stars gathered today in Los Angeles, in a unified demand for stronger, more intense sexual intercourse. Fuck me with your big cock! Give it to me harder. Fuck me 'til I explode! Calling the tragedy a terrible, unintentional mistake, the Los Angeles Police Department issued an apology today for the accidental shooting, clubbing, stabbing, firebombing, choking, impaling, electrocution, legal injection death of an African American man. I'm Kepp Kendall, reporting for "The Onion News." As the conflict between Sloravia and Azmenistan deepens, college campuses across this country have become a hotbed of political activity. We're here in Santa Cruz, California today. Let's listen in. Stop violence. Stop the violence. Stop the mothafucking violence! Increase the peace! For the past three years, Sloravia and Azmenistan have been locked in a pointless and bloody war. Their cowardly leaders sent innocent, young men into battle to die. To die. Well, you know what? We need to put those leaders in a room and let them fight it out! You know what else? What this countries need to do, they need to do, they need to listen to their women a little more. Yeah! 'Cause women, women create life. While men, they destroy it. So let's all stand up against the corporate war machine that only exists to do the imperialistic agenda against the... the oppressed minority! Right? Love you, love you brother! Peace! Go on, love! Excuse me, Chad. What's up? We're the U.N. and let me just say, we are very impressed. What you said up there was dead on, Chad. Dead-on. What? We want you to negotiate talks between Sloravia and Azmenistan. Shut up, dude. - We're convinced you're the man who can finally bring peace to this troubled region. - Will you do it, Chad? Will you help us... increase the peace? Fuck yeah! Fuck yeah, dude, I'm in. - Great. Will you come with me, please? Yeah. Your systematic campaign of aggression against my country is the reason-- Our military operations are purely in the response for your repeated violation of the treaty! You are the one to violate the peace treaty-- We? Whoa, whoa, whoa! Guys! Guys, chill. Chill. Let's take a chill pill here. Don't you guys realize that, war no matter how justified it may seem, is not the answer. It's not? No, man. Love is the answer. Now. Let's get this peace shit started. * A baby is born An old man dies * * One child's laughing while another one cries * * Seasons change right before my eyes * * Sun comes up The sun goes down * * The world takes another spin around * * Tide goes out Tide goes in * * Life goes on, on again * In international news, the crisis between Sloravia and Azmenistan deepened today when the leaders of the two rival nations-- Hey America! Get ready to... punch some cock! Tomorrow is the deadline for Sloravia to pull out of the Uzbagiyak region. If it's not our lead story, consider it my resignation. "Cockpuncher" mania. Two minutes, Norm. And now, "The Onion News," America's Finest News Source. - Honey, it's about to start. Featuring Dana Dobbs, Senior Correspondent, Kepp Kendalls, and award-winning anchor, Norm Archer. Good evening. For the past 27 years, I sat at this desk, dedicating myself to one thing, delivering the news to you, the American viewing public, in the most fair, balanced, serious way possible. What's he doing? Well. Things are changing in the news game. And I've been under pressure to change with them. Desperate to stay one step ahead of the competition, the powers that be at this network have done everything they can to get me to compromise my values. To attract more of those precious, Nielsen eyeballs. And once I get those eyeballs, what do they want me to do? Plug our parent company's movies and other products like a two bit, network news whore. Motherfucker! Well. I've been giving this whole, ugly business a lot of thought. In just a few moments before going on the air tonight, I finally came to a conclusion. And that conclusion is-- Nobody move! Or the anchor infidel dies! The Al-Q'Utaya Terrorists' Organization officially declares war on the decadent, immoral, United States of Satan. We shit on your country! And piss also! It was good. Tonight, on live television, the American people will watch this great spreader of Western lies get blown into pieces. Cutting the cameras. Unless, the United States government formally apologizes for it's rotting, immoral culture. And withdraws all troops from the Middle East. Like that's gonna happen. Are you listening... ... Mr. President? We might be fucked, sir. We will do it. We will kill him right here, if you do not meet our demands. - Oh, yeah? I don't think you have the balls. Cockpuncher! Ahmed. It is the mighty puncher of cocks! How nice of you to join us... ... Cockpuncher. We've been expecting you. Allow me to introduce the Al-Q'Utaya Terrorist Organization. I'm hungry. I could sure go for a Sunday topped with... ... crushed nuts. Yummy! Come on, Cockpuncher! Go get them! Give him a rock! I believe you will be releasing Norm now. Not so fast... Cockpuncher. Cockblocked. The clever terrorist. They blocked their cocks. - Maybe I can be of some assistance? You don't want to hurt Norm. Melissa Cherry! You don't wanna hurt America. This is the greatest, gosh darned country in the whole, wide world. Oh, she is-- Denis, give me a drink. Where else can you take a shot at our dreams and make them come true? Where else can you take a stand for what's right? And change millions of minds. And most importantly, where else can you take me from behind? Hit it boys! * Oh, when you love me * You know that I don't mind * What I really want is for you * * to take me from behind, yeah * * And when you want me * You know that I don't mind * Oh, and what I really want is for you... Come on, Cherry. What the fuck is going on? * Oh * And when you love me * You know that I don't mind No, no * * What I really want is for you to take me from behind * * Yeah, and when you love me * You know that I don't mind Oh * * And what I really want is for you to take me from behind * * Oh, yeah, I don't mind... Ahman! Think unsexy thoughts! Think unsexy thoughts. Think unsexy thoughts. Think unsexy thoughts! Your immoral, Western sexuality will not work on us. Mr. President, the time has come to give in to our demands. If we do not hear from you in ten seconds, we will kill everyone in this studio. We might be fucked, sir. Ten! Nine! Eight! Seven! Six! Five! Four! Three! Two! One! Not so rapido! Peruvians! Daddy, what's a Peruvian? It's kind of like a Mexican, son. Viva Peru. Que viva. You Cockpuncher, amigo You know Ahman, violence is almost never necessary. I admit. I've punched thousands upon thousands of cocks in my life, but I've never killed anyone because no matter what your religion might be, no matter what your politics might be, no matter how much money is involved, there's never any reason to take human life. Human life is the most previous thing there is. Fuck aye, man. That's some cool shit, man. You know what? You are absolutely right, Cockpuncher. Violence is not the answer. Terrorism never solved anything. To hell with terrorism! Yeah! Yeah. I'm sick and tired of living in a fucking cave. I'm sick of doing nothing but cursing the West all day. Jesus aged Allah. I like the West. Good bless America. I like TV. And I like bacon, double cheese burgers. Woo-hoo! And I like the rapping music. But most of all, I like this big budget action hero. Long live the mighty puncher of cocks! Woo! Hey, Norm. Crazy shit, huh? With all due respect, we just wanted to ask... What-what were you going to say during your speech? Yeah, we were wondering what the conclusion that you came to was. Well, I was going to say, "I'm mad as hell, I'm not going to take it anymore." But after what just happened, I think I learned a little lesson I won't soon forget. As a matter of fact, I think we've all learned a few things in the past 90 minutes. We've learned that Irishmen have huge nipples, we've learned that film critic intellectuals are a bunch of gaywads. And most of all, we've learned... ... creeping corporate influence over the news protects us from terrorism. Hey, everybody. We're all gonna get laid! Cannonball! Um, I can't help but think it must have taken a lot courage to make such a provocative film. And joining us to discuss just that, is the man who green-lit the film. Thanks, Kenneth. Pleasure to be here. So, uh... Now while you gave the makers of this film tremendous leeway, obviously, still, there was some material that you simply refused to allow? That's true. Basically, as committed as I was to letting this guys be free to do their thing, there were simply some images that I just didn't feel comfortable with. Hmm-mmm. But I understand you did bring some clips. That's right, uh, I would like to show some special bonus material. This are scenes that didn't make it into the movie. Great. Let's take a look. What we do, is we get the kitty and we put it in a simple egg batter. Oh, shh, that's fine. And then we just simply roll it around, making sure we cover the whole thing, entirely. Making sure it's completely covered in an herb, bread crumb batter. Here. - I see. Okay, thank you. And then-- oh, oh! --the canola oil. You know, I think you have to draw a line somewhere. For the Onion News, this is Norm Archer. Fuck you and good night.
