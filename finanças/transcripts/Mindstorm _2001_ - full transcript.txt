We are at the LZ and ready for pickup. Over. MAN (OVER RADIO): Bravo team, this is Sky Raider. We read you. Commence deployment protocol. We roger that, Sky Raider. We are in position. Await immediate extraction. Over. MAN (OVER RADIO): Bravo team, this is Renegade. We're showing two bogeys closing from your north. You should have visual any second. [suspenseful music] [helicopter whirring] [beeping] Move! [explosions] [gunfire] [whoosh] [helicopter whirring] Get your pack off. [suspenseful music] [beeping] [blast] [explosion] Hey, here you go. You're the one who is not supposed to be here. You go first. A big price was paid for those documents. [suspenseful music] [helicopter whirring] OK, you win. Here. [beeping] [blast] [explosion] MAN 1 (OVER RADIO): Sky Raider, your skies are free and clear. MAN 2 (OVER RADIO): Roger, Renegade. Sky Raider is on final approach. [suspenseful music] [hissing] [dramatic music] Here. Last man carries it. It's the only way they'll take us all out. [gunshot] [grunts] [groaning] [suspenseful music] [chatter] [gunfire] [gunfire] Woo! [laughs] Man, I'm freezing my ass off. [yelling] [gunshots] [gunfire] [grunting] Blew my side arm right out. Sir, do you have the documents? No, they're still on the ground! That's a negative on the documents. He does not have them. Hey! [gunfire] What do we do? We gotta pick up the rest of our men. Our objective was to get those documents, that's it. [gunfire] [grunts] Well, they're down there! The damn things are down there, along with my men! That's not our problem, sir. Oh, the hell it isn't. Sit down. Do you understand, sir? [coughs] [suspenseful music] [gunshot] This is on your hands. [dramatic music] You hear me? On your hands! [plane whirring] [suspenseful music] A mountain-- Mount Everest. Picture of a woman. [zap] Wait a second, it's a painting-- the Mona Lisa. [suspenseful music] It's a girl. [zaps] Jerry, do you see anything else? [zap] Like what? Do you see anything else? [zap] [scream] I'm sorry, I can't concentrate anymore today. It's all right. Let's call it a day. [sighs] [drumming] His concentration is getting worse. Hi. How'd you make out? I went for 92, and I just lost it. It's a phase. And what's on the menu today? Flashcards. Better do 95. Whatever. They want one man fully trained in less than six months. He'll be fine. He is not fine. We have a problem that's getting worse. There are men whose entire world has been in this facility. I'm surprised you haven't had more problems. [zap] [whoosh] That's precisely the point. The lab experiment will identify any more problems. And what if something goes wrong with the exercise? Then what? I'll see you at the test tonight. [drumming] [suspenseful music] [whoosh] [shrieking] [suspenseful music] [electronic music] [car horns honking] [electronic music] Thank you. No more bets. [clinking] The winning number is 8. $1,380. Thank you very much. Thanks so much. Thanks for the bonus. [electronic music] Can you please hurry? I have a plane to catch. [speaking russian] I'm sorry, I don't understand. I have a plane to catch so if the gentleman doesn't mind. [snap] Well, well, Silvia Cheminsky. I see that my first warning didn't do you any good. I'm afraid, this time, the warning will be somewhat harsher. [grunting] [electronic music] [russian] [groaning] [shriek] [dog panting] [zap] [barking] [zap] [growl] [shriek] [barking] [distant scream] [panting] [suspenseful music] [thud] Get dressed. [suspenseful music] Doc, we're only budgeted for one man to proceed to the final level of training. Neither is ready, especially David. It's time to push the birds out of the nest, Doctor. What if the birds crash to the ground? What if they are not ready? 20 years of work will be destroyed. They're ready. You don't know that. They want one man fully trained in less than six months. I'd rather they fail in here than the middle of a mission somewhere. I would rather have two fully-trained men, one to back up the other if the first failed. As I said, Doctor, the budget will only allow for one to proceed. Is this what it's all about? Money. We're talking about the lives of two men. ROJACK: It's always about money, Doctor. How do you think we won the Cold War? We outspent you. [drumming] [suspenseful music] What the hell is he going to do if they go out of control? You'd use the beta gun. Locks telekinetic abilities. I know how the beta gun works. I just hope that your prevention doesn't become the problem. ROJACK: Jerry, how you feeling? You ready? Yes, I'm ready. ROJACK: Excellent. Bring in David. Hey, bud. Guess you and me are the best of the best now. JERRY: I guess so. Shall we begin? Gentlemen, welcome to the last and final stage of your testing and development. This will be a full power test of your individual telekinetic abilities against each other. So what are the rules? There are no rules. There's only one winner. What do you mean, wins? Yeah, what do you mean, wins? Gentlemen, this is a combat exercise. You are enemies. Go to war. [electronic music] [whooshing] [clank] [whooshing] [thud] [whooshing] [clanking] [thud] [electronic music] [whooshing] [thud] You didn't see that coming, did you, Jerry? [electronic music] [whirring] [clanking] [grunts] Someone will be killed. There can only be one winner. [whooshing] [glass shattering] [whooshing] [thud] DAVID: [grunts] [whooshing] [grunts] [whoosh] [grunts] [moaning] ROJACK: It's not over, Jerry. Finish him. DAVID: [moaning] ROJACK: Finish him off, Jerry. Kill him, Jerry. It's part of the program, it's OK. Kill him. Kill him! [gunshot] [zap] JERRY: No! ROJACK: Jerry, finish him! [thud] Relax, Jerry. Everything's all right. Nothing's all right. What happened to them? I don't know what you're talking about. I want to know what happened to my parents. [moans] [zap] [grunts] [alarm blaring] Yes, you do know. I don't know. [gunfire] [alarm blaring] [suspenseful music] [gunshots] [explosion] [alarm blaring] [suspenseful music] [zap] [baby crying] [dog barks] [explosion] [alarm blaring] [suspenseful music] [gunshots] [whirring] [clank] [suspenseful music] Fucker! [suspenseful music] DR. JANKO (OVER RADIO): He got loose outside. What do you mean he got outside? DR. JANKO (OVER RADIO): Through the ventilation. [suspenseful music] Scramble security and find him. Do you understand? We need a fucking translator. Find him! [suspenseful music] [city sounds] [dark music] [knocking] [knocking] [knocking] [thud] [grunts] Rojack, what the hell are you doing here? It's good to see you too, Mink. Who's with you? Nobody. I came alone. Bullshit. Who's outside? Go ahead, check. You move and I'll kill ya. So can I get up? No. Why the hell are you here? You live in this shit hole? You should've called. I would've cleaned up. What do you want? To give you a job. MINK: A job? I don't work for you anymore. [whoosh] On your hands! Remember? You guys made it so I couldn't work for anybody. I can't even go home. My passport's worthless. Strangely, every US Customs agent knows my face. Last year, when my father died, I couldn't even go to his funeral. I didn't have anything to do with that. I tried to stop them. [snickers] You never tried. You let me twist in the wind. You violated the basic rule in getting out the package. It goes first, then you. What'd you expect, a fucking medal? I just wanted to save my men. You should've scheduled another extraction. By whose authority? Yours? As soon as they saw I didn't have the package, they split. Adios! End of story. You failed the mission. You got my team killed. [eerie music] [city sounds] I need you come to Bulgaria with me. [chuckles] Bulgaria? With you? I want you to lead a team. Another team. What's this team gotta do? Find somebody. That's what a private investigator does. This isn't a normal person. It's going to be different. Really? What do I get when I find him? The Balkans incident wiped off your record. And? You get your life back. [eerie music] ROJACK: Looks familiar, doesn't it? [electronic music] [tires screeching] - Evan Mink? - Yeah. I'm here to pick you up. [electronic music] Hans Martina. Hans Martina. Sounds like a German lounge singer. Yeah, that's what I tell the women. So Rojack tells me you've done a lot of work here in Eastern Europe. Some. When? It's been a while. The place reminds me of a low-budget version of Las Vegas. You ever been to Vegas? What? Oh, no. [suspenseful music] You made it. Do you have a nuclear test in here? No. Uh, Evan Mink, Hans, this is Jules Denston. She's from MI1s parapsychology and telepathic studies. This is Hans Martina. He'll be our leading expert in weapons. And this is the infamous Evan Mink, the reigning expert in tracking people. Please, sit down. 25 years ago, the Russians developed a top secret advanced telekinetic program called Mindstorm. After the Cold War, the United States adopted the program. We've been working together ever since. Subjects using the program are trained at a very young age to allow their minds to properly develop their telepathic skills and telekinetic skills. Russia started the program with five subjects. Only one subject made it through. His name is Jerry Cheminsky. He possesses both telepathic and telekinetic skills. HANS: Wait, he can move objects with his mind? Yes. Like what? We're not aware of the full extent of his telekinetic skills, but that's irrelevant. Your job is to find him and bring him back. A lot of money has been spent on him over the last 25 years. We don't want it to go to waste. Or end up in the wrong hands. ROJACK: Exactly. That's why we hired you to track him. Tracking him is one thing, bringing someone back alive is another. Why aren't the Russians looking for Jerry? The Russians don't want to be seen using strong-arm tactics in, uh, former satellite territories. We've been assigned for the job. Are there any more questions? Good. Chopper's waiting. Shall we? [helicopter whirring] How does it work? Through the high-density beta wave pulse. Renders all telekinetic abilities useless among other brain functions. Look. [zapping] That's all. Evan, how do you know where he's going? He got his hands on his classified file. The only personal information in it was about his biological sister in Kardzhali. Where else would he go? Is she still alive? It doesn't matter. If you were Jerry, where else would you go? [mysterious music] [birds chirping] [thwap] [gasps] Oh! [moans] Where's the money? I got thrown out before I could cash out. All the casinos know me. [shrieks] [thud] Bullshit. Check under her bed. That's where she keeps it. Here, take it. What's this? What did you play? Roulette. This is all there is? Yes. Liar. [moaning] [knocking] [moans] Yes? I'm here to see Silvia. Silvia? There is no Silvia here. [eerie notes] [whoosh] She's here. No. Hey, mama, is there a Silvia here? No! See? Sorry, friend, you're mistaken. I know she's here. How did you-- Can I talk to you for a moment? No, she's not going out. I don't know who you are. Get out. Leave my daughter alone. I need to speak with her now. [eerie notes] You work for Vladi or Nikolai? What? [bulgarian] [zap] You know, the loan sharks, gamblers. What? I split it 70/30. 70/30? 60/40. I've got expenses. I just bought this house for my foster parents. Deal? Deal. [whoosh] [suspenseful music] [whoosh] [gasps] [helicopter whirring] [panting] [suspenseful music] [beeping] [gunfire] Ah! [gunfire] [beeping] [gunfire] [explosion] [beeping] [gunfire] [growl] [explosion] [gunfire] Ah! Ah! [helicopter whirring] [suspenseful music] [beeping] [beeping] [explosion] [beeping] [explosion] [whoosh] Damn it. [dramatic music] [whooshing] [beeping] [whooshing] [gunfire] MAN (OVER RADIO): Mayday. Regain control. [suspenseful music] [shouting] [rapid beeping] Run! PILOT: [yelling] [thunderous thud] [dramatic music] Confirm-- the targets have escaped. The targets have escaped. MAN (OVER RADIO): All right, move out. [mysterious music] [suspenseful music] MINK: You speak English? Step behind the tape, please. [beeping] What are you doing here? Was this the Cheminsky residence? Shit, let's get out of here. It was the Cheminsky residence, now it's firewood. Any survivors? Look around. What do you think? Check them out. Did you know Silvia Cheminsky? Oh, her. Everyone in Kardzhali knows her. She had the gift? The gift? GUARD: Looking at cards. Always in the casinos. Think casino lose too much money. Maybe the casino tried to end the problems once and for all. For gambling? She never loses. So you think the casino had had enough of her and decided to take care of her. Who else would want to hurt her? She won. Casino have an attack helicopter? All the bodies are male. One female, mid 40s. Might be the foster mother. [mysterious music] [non-english speech] He says one man did all this. One man. [clanking] [suspenseful music] [engine whirring] What's the problem, Mink? Why don't you tell us what we're up against here. You read the file. You know what you're dealing with. Come on. Uri Geller bends spoons. This guy's dropping helicopters out of the sky. Are you sure it's OK to come in? Yeah, it's a church. Everyone is welcome. Really? You've never been in a church before? Huh-uh. [eerie music] And now you want the three of us to bring in a guy who took out a whole Russian brigade using his mind. [mysterious music] What I'm about to tell you is highly classified. [snickers] ROJACK: The Russians were trying to develop telekinetics as a weapon. [whooshing] We didn't know if it would work. I guess you guys really guessed wrong on that one. [laughs] Project Mindstorm was the mission you screwed up in '89. You had no idea how important that mission was and now look where we are. Yeah, I knew four guys who paid the price. [thwap] I think they know. All right, look, the kid was trained entirely in English. He's a perfect weapon against the United States if he ever goes operational. Well, the Russians aren't the enemy anymore. I'm not talking about the Russians. I'm talking about anybody who gets their hands on him. What if the Russians find him before we do? He'll be terminated. Why? MINK: Because their project's been compromised. They'd rather kill Jerry than risk another escape. [gunshot] But if you find him and bring him back, the United States gets control of a very powerful weapon. You could have prevented this whole thing. Now it's come back to haunt you. You want to go home? Next time you call, you better have Jerry. [smacks lips] Silvia, do you remember your real parents? They were killed when I was a baby. I lived in a foster homes after that. You don't remember anything? I don't know. Sometimes, I have a dream. Do they think he have something to do with my real parents? What about a brother? Please, don't take them! [babies crying] Please! A brother in my dream? In that dream, there were two babies taken away from each other? Please! I mean, how could you know that? I was the other baby. I don't understand. What's this? Read it. It's an official document. It says we're sister and brother? Twins? Yes. This is-- I mean, it's impossible. Silvia, you're my sister. [solemn music] [speaking bulgarian] Yes. It's the only map they have got. It's pretty old. If this road is still here, we can follow it to the Greek border. With Greece, we're going to need passports or documents or cash, right? Don't worry about that. What do they do here? It's a monastery. They are monks. They pray and study the Bible. Please. [mysterious music] I grew up hearing about these monks. They've been trying to rebuild the cross. It's taken over 200 years. But they don't have the money or help. [birds chirping] [suspenseful music] [speaking bulgarian] The CIA wants Jerry dead as much as we do. So who are they working for? The CIA? Bullshit. Jerry is worth millions of dollars to the right country. I want him alive. If he worth millions, it's worthy for me to bring him in. Oh, you already tried. I've got Evan Mink tracking him now. Mink is a loose cannon. You've have him on a shelf for years. Well, trust me, he'll find him. Trust you? That's why I'm here. And what if he doesn't find him and he's my problem again? He'll find him. KGB is willing to pay anything for Jerry. I will give you 48 hours to find him and contain him. And then? Then we'd come at him with everything we've got. Understood. So you want to ask me my price for giving you 48 hours? That's $5 million for every 24 hours I give you. Two. Three. Agreed. That's $6 million. I can do the math. [suspenseful music] Yeah, I got something. It's about four kilometers ahead. Random traces of beta waves all over the place. Sounds like our lad's been here. [suspenseful music] What's this all about? [suspenseful music] [speaking bulgarian] [speaking bulgarian] What'd she say? Said a miracle has taken place. What miracle? The cross up there has been broken for centuries. And, this morning, this. [mysterious music] Let me see the map. Ugh, we missed something. OK, if the highway's our straightest shot south, Jerry left the monastery and made his way through the woods. Hidden off the main roads, he'd go here. That's where I'd bet he'd go. [electronic music] [couple arguing in bulgarian] Engine just gave up now. You a mechanic? No. [electronic music] [whooshing] Hm. I think it's fixed. You fix it already? I think so. [engine turns over] Yeah, thanks. [laughs] [dramatic music] Get in the car. Car trouble? Oh, no. We are fine now. [speaking bulgarian] [suspenseful music] Get out of the car. [groans] What are you, looking for trouble? Huh? [zap] [moaning] [suspenseful music] [whooshing] [grunts] [screams] [whooshing] [yells] [suspenseful music] [gunfire] [grunting] [gunshots] [thud] [whooshing] [explosion] [suspenseful music] That's him! [zap] Uh-uh. Uh-uh. Silvia, don't do that. Jerry, look, we just want to bring you in. We don't want to hurt you. For what? I'm just bringing him in. Drop your guns. Look, I don't want to hurt him. Drop the gun! I'm not asking again. Jerry, get in the car. MINK: Been looking for you guys everywhere. How far you think you're gonna get? Huh? Jerry? [car starts] There they go. [eerie music] [whispers] They took a family hostage and hit the road south. For the moment. What? Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute. Listen to me, you bring in another team, I guarantee they'll be gone. I can still find them. [mumbling in bulgarian] [cows mooing] Shit! [mumbling in bulgarian] Rojack says we're done. It's over. So let's get out of here. [mumbling in bulgarian] What are they saying? HANS: They're scared. They say the man had the powers of a god. According to Rojack, the mission's over. But I don't want to see this kid and his sister killed. I say we finish the mission. OK? Give me the map. I hope all this doesn't blow up in our face. OK, they'd still be headed south. We gotta stop for cash and figure out a way across the border. Sozopol. [electronic music] Thank you. Thank you. - Bye bye. - Bye. Bye. Thank you. You bet. We need more cash. We have to buy passports. How are we gonna do that? Leave that to me. Come on. [electronic music] Here, take that. What is that? It's a restraining harness. Makes his telekinetic powers useless. Are you sure it'll work? In theory. You never tested it? On who, Uri Geller? [electronic music] Here you go. If I lose the first $10, I'll need. But I don't usually lose. It's going to take me a little time to build up some winnings. [electronic music] [bulgarian] (WHISPERS) Get out of here. I go to do my thing. DEALER: Miss, stay or hit? Miss? Stay. [whooshing] [slot machine beeping] [clinking metal] [electronic music] What are you doing? Hey, look, I won. I know, I know. Now, let's get out of here. Wait, wait, wait, wait. We're still winning. Hey, Jerry. Remember the part I told you? We didn't want any attention? Now you just pulled that. Let's go. [electronic music] Yeah. That's something. Yeah. Police is answering a call at the Sozopol Casino-- possible slot cheaters. I'll bet you that's them. [electronic music] [city sounds] Now what? [electronic music] Come on. Come on. What do you got? Keep going straight ahead. [electronic music] [dogs barking] [zap] [burbling water] [zap] [dark music] [eerie notes] [clicking] [voice echoes] [high pitched note] [zapping] [thud] SILVIA: Jerry?

ROJACK: (ECHOES) You ready? Jerry? ROJACK: [voice echoes] Jerry? Jerry? Jerry? Don't hurt her. What the hell is this? Who are they? They don't look Turkish to me. Whatever, let's get out of here. [echoes] [zap] [growling] Blood. [thud] [thump] [thud] [speaking russian] [horn honking] [speaking russian] You guys keep your eye on me. Follow my lead, understand? Now, get out and act friendly. Sorry. Ugh. It's a rental, you know? Ugh. Hey, you guys don't know where the Sozopol Zoo is, do ya? I guess not. Looked great on the brochure. [suspenseful music] That's a really, really bad idea. [dogs barking] All right, I take the one on the right. Jules takes the one on the left. Evan, you get the rest? Will you shut up? [speaking russian] What's he saying? He's going to shoot us. What else would he say, he'll buy us dinner? [suspenseful music] Stand down! [speaking russian] [speaking russian] [speaking russian] [speaking russian] I swear, Mink, I could set my watch by the times you disobeyed an order. Who the hell are they? Russians. Great. It's my deal now. The Russians are willing to pay a lot more than your $6 million. But I'll be fair. How about $1 million finder's fee? Our deal was $3 million. Hey, that was your deal. Now, I hold all the cards. $1 million. OK. [speaking russian] [russian] ROJACK: Move this car, would you? You're full of shit. This is a setup from the start. I just saved your ass. You're lucky to be walking out of here alive. I flush him out so the Russians can bag him? Lose the loyalty act, Mink. It's whoever got here first. Get the hell off. They'll kill him. That's not our problem. [snickers] Yeah, I've heard that before. Go home, Mink, while you still can. We had a deal. You'll get your passport. And my record? Wiped clean. This is big fun for you, isn't it? Deals on deals, lies and lies. [suspenseful music] What the hell is going on? [car starts] I need a drink. [suspenseful music] [zap] [whoosh] [dramatic music] [drumming] [dramatic music] [dramatic music] I look at you and all I see is a man. [zap] [grunts] And yet you destroy my helicopters and kill my soldiers with nothing but your thoughts. But now, I have you. So tell me, whose mind is more powerful? [drumming] [dramatic music] [speaking russian] [whooshing] [speaking russian] MINK: Hold it right there. Nyet. [whooshing] [thud] What are you doing up here? Turn the plane around and fly south towards Greece. We have our orders. Do it now or I'll do it for you. [whooshing] [grunting] Ground control, Gemini 7737 has changed course. Veering now at 20 south, 16 west. [beeping] [dramatic music] AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL (OVER RADIO): Gemini, return to your previous flight path or you will be just shot down. We read you, but we are not in control up here. AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL (OVER RADIO): Gemini, this is an order. Return to your flight path or you will be fired upon. Damn it! Do you not understand we are not in control up here. Please. [dramatic music] [buzzing] [beep] [groaning] [beeping] AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL (OVER RADIO): Gemini, this is your final warning. Return to your flight path. [whooshing] [beeping] We are going to crash! PILOT (OVER RADIO): This is Trans Global 200. You're in our flight line, Gemini. [suspenseful music] [beeping] Please, break off. Repeat, you have to break off. [beeping] [grunting] PILOT (OVER RADIO): Gemini, do you read me? [suspenseful music] [growls] [beeping] Visual lock. [suspenseful music] [whoosh] They fired! [suspenseful music] [whooshing] [explosion] [grunting] [buzzer] [explosion] Mayday! Mayday! This is Gemini and we are going down! [explosion] [buzzer] Hold on. [yelling] [explosion] [fire crackling] SILVIA: [moans] Ah! [explosion] [electronic music] Evan, what are you going to do now? I'm about to have another one. Waiter. I meant when you get back to the States. [whoosh] I'll figure that out when I get there. Well, the Russians got to Jerry before we did. He's right. We did our jobs. [electronic music] [dog barking] Just wanted to get it right this time. What do you think has happened to the kid? I don't know. JULES: There was something special about him. What is this, a pity party? What do you want? ROJACK: [sighs] A little situation's developed. I need your assistance. My assistance? [laughs] My assistance? Don't you love this guy? ROJACK: Jerry's plane crashed. MINK: He's dead. Problem solved. ROJACK: Well, the Russians think he's dead. I can't take that chance. I need you to come to the crash site, give me some visual confirmation. Go visualize it yourself. ROJACK: Would you excuse us for one moment, please? I made a deal with you-- get your passport back and get your slate wiped clean. I'll change that deal so quick, it'll make your head spin. [glass shattering] Take that as a yes? I swear, Mink, gotta watch your temper. Trouble every time. [helicopter whirring] This report says the plane exploded on impact. Exploded after impact. Someone could've got out. You know someone got out, don't you? Rojack, enough of the bullshit! The US Recon satellite picked up two figures leaving the crash site just before it blew. And the Russians don't know. That's what I thought. Now, that wasn't so hard, was it? What? Tell me the truth. Believe me, it was. [helicopter whirring] [suspenseful music] Come on, Silvia. I got to rest. Go, be right behind you. No, come on, get up here. All right. [zap] Wait a second. Wait a second. Wait a second. [mysterious music] Wait here. SILVIA: [moaning] Hold it, Jerry. Back away or I'll fucking kill her. Back away, I said. I said back away! MINK: Hey! What the hell are you doing? I got it covered, Mink. I know what I'm doing. Hans! [beeping] [zapping] Hey, what are you doing to him? He's all right. He's not hurt. Three dots-- normal. No problem. I want to hear it from him! Jerry! Look, we wanna get you out of here, get you to the States. You'll be safe there. This is Wolf. Ready for extraction. MAN (OVER RADIO): We read you, Wolf. Our ETA is in 10 minutes.
