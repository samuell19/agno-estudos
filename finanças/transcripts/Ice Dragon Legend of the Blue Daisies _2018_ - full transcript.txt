Subtitles by explosiveskull It's so beautiful. Hello. - Good morning, miss! - Good morning. - Good morning, Melody. - Everything looks so wonderful Thank you, dear. Good morning, Mrs. Potterson. Those buns smell wonderful. May I have some, please? Of course. Just a couple? Yes, please. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Huh? Hey, watch out! Crazy kids. Ah! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Where do you think you're going? Don't give me those puppy dog eyes. I think he's got his sights on those shiny apples of yours. I think you're right. Here's one for you, miss, on the house. - Thanks. - Not for you. Now, back in those days, everyone would sing the song with thankful hearts. It was a simple song, simple enough for anyone to learn. But it was different, not like any other song, for it had amazing power. - Power? - What kind of power? Was it magical? Yes, but not simple magic like pixie dust or tricks to the eye. The song was true magic because it could actually change hearts. What? The song could bring hope to despair, light to darkness, even change sad to glad. - Really? - Wow. Where did the song come from? Well, it was a gift, you see. A gift? You mean like a present? Yes, from the great Giver of Gifts. And in the beginning, everyone was thankful and loved the song. But that was before Dracon. Dracon? Mm, Dracon. He was once a noble guardian of the song, a knight sworn to love and protect it. When Dracon sang the song, it was wonderful. His voice was like a symphony of one. But Dracon became prideful and wanted to use the song to gain power and praise for himself. This led him on a path into darkness and away from the light. He tried to use sorcery to steal the song's power, but a deep magic in the song prevented this from happening. Mm, ah, yes! When Dracon realized he could not have what he wanted, his heart was filled with hate. And he vowed to make all who loved the song his enemy or his slaves. - Slaves? - Oh, my! He's bad. Far worse than bad. Dracon was evil. Then what happened? Well, there was no telling what he would do next, and so the Giver dispatched Michael, a faithful guardian of the song, to find Dracon and stop him. The Giver gave Michael a special gift... armor and a sword that could defeat the powers of darkness. Dracon, your wicked scheme has come undone. Surrender yourself. I pray there may yet be a trace of mercy set aside for you. Mercy. You come offering mercy to me? With a sword? Are we to be brothers again? That's close enough. But I want us to be close, like old times. I want you to understand. I don't need mercy from you or the Giver! What are you doing? You've changed, Dracon. The darkness has blinded you. You are wrong! My eyes have been opened in the darkness. I see clearly now. Here in the shadows, there are secrets and power beyond anything you could imagine. It is you who have been blinded by the light! Goodbye, old friend. Get out of my way. I cannot let you pass. Fine! Then you shall be the first to fall. Dracon, what have you done? Look, Dad, a falling star. The Guardians of Light. Here! Dracon, for your rebellion against the Giver, you are hereby banished to the depths of the Earth. Forever is the song and the light! And so Michael banished Dracon to the depths of the deep mountain cave, there to remain a prisoner forever. Forever? Well, as long as there were believers to sing the song, Dracon was powerless to escape his prison. Is it true the song makes the blue daisies grow? Yes! The blue daisies are a sign of all those who believe in the song. I believe, Nicholai. - Yeah, me too. - We all believe. That's... That's wonderful! I am Michael, defender of the realm. I can defeat the evil Dracon, yeah! Yeah! Fight the dragon! Can you teach us the song, Nicholai? Yes, will you, please? Of course I will. You'll do no such thing! You're frightening the children again with your wild stories, aren't you? - Move along, children. - And don't let me catch you listening to that old fool again. Aww. Sorry, Nicholai. - But I like the story. - Me too! I meant no harm. I was just... Fill their heads with wild imaginings and that old religion!

All right, I'm leaving! Why didn't you fight back? They're our friends. I have no quarrel with them. You call them friends? I'm trying to be their friend, yes. Not all battles are won with a sword. Read. You'll see. - I love you, Nicholai. - I love you too. And don't worry. Everything will be fine. Now, I have work to do. I've uncovered another section of the wall. - Okay, see you later. - All right. Come on, Hunter. Move it, boy. Let's get him! Whoa! Come on, boys, this is too easy. - Thanks, Mrs. Potterson! - Leif! You call that fighting? Take that! You guys are lame! - Ah! Oh! Get off me! - They're pecking me! What's the matter? You guys chicken? Buk, buk, buk, bawk! Shh. Quiet, Hunter. We'll ambush 'em. Hmm? Hey! Don't worry, princess, I'll defend you! Take that, you dirty dogs! Watch where you're going! Whoa! Thanks. If you step on those daisies, you'll be in big trouble. Hey, watch it! My flowers! Now you're in for it. - Hah! Yah! - Hey! That's mine! Give it back! Yikes! That girl's crazy! And keep off my flowers! Wow. Whoa. How did you do that? No more fighting in my garden! No, really, that thing you did with the flowers, is that a trick? Guess again. Ah! You're pretty good with that broom, you know. Nice fighting you, but I've got stuff to do. Hey, wait, wait, what kind of stuff? Stay, boy. You sure ask a lot of questions. I thought this old place was abandoned. What do you do in here? I live here with my grandpa now. Huh? What is this place? Don't you know anything? This is Sanctuary, the old meeting place. Meeting place? For what? People did lots of things here: talking, singing, searching for stuff. What kind of stuff? Oh, an excellent question, young man. Hi, Nicholai. There's a wonderful story hidden in these walls, and I'm going to find it. It's been hiding here for years. Hey, look, your trick flowers. Blue daisies, boy, and they're not a trick. - They're a promise. - Huh? Yes, a promise. As long as the blue daisies are here, everything is as it should be, and our world is safe. Safe? From what? Why, the dragon, of course. The dragon. Of course! An ice dragon, to be precise. Very dangerous and very clever. Wait, you actually believe that stuff? What else would you believe? Okay, well, hey, that's really interesting. Melody, I've gotta go now, leave you two to do whatever you are doing. Nice trick with the flowers though. See ya! It's not a trick. The blue daisies are a promise. And they have power. Flower power? Sounds girly. It's not. I can take you to a secret place and show you, if you're not scared. Of what, the flower monster? No, not the flower monster. The ice dragon. Yeah, you're scared. I understand. You don't have to go with me tomorrow after breakfast, starting out by the town gate. Bye, Leif. Don't be late. Hunter, it's just a statue. Come on, boy. We don't believe in dragons. Patience, Melody. He'll be here. Hey, you're not Leif. Stay here, boy. Leif, are you okay? Talk to me! Please say something! Leif! Gotcha! Aw, Hunter, cut it out! Come on! Hunter, really, I'm okay. I guess we're even. Yeah, well, we'll have to see about that. Come on, we've got a ways to go. Lead on, princess. Will you stop calling me that? As you command. I'm really happy you decided to come along, Leif. Are we there yet? Not yet. Hey, I know this place. These stones always creeped me out as a kid. They're echo stones. They're guardians of the song. Leif! Leif! Leif! See what I mean? Stop it. It's creeping me out. Scaredy cat. Come on, this way. Hunter, let's go, boy! This is where the mountain path is hidden. - Are we there yet? - Will you stop asking me that? Well, are we? Almost. They're almost gone, you know. - What's almost gone? - The blue daisies. The ones around Sanctuary are all that's left. In the village, at least. Nicholai says it's because no one believes in the song anymore. What do you think? I think he's right. Look, we're here. Finally. Follow me. Uh, Melody? This way. Whoa. How'd you find this place? Nicholai showed me. He comes up here often to think and pray. This is it! The blue fields! Sweet. Where's the blue? You need to do the magic dance. Really? I can do it. I want to do it. Okay. Hop on one leg and stick out your tongue. Uh... Now make a beat. And spin around in circles. Keep trying. Faster! I can't do it. Aw, I was just messing with you. It's not magic or some kind of trick. It's the song. You sing the song. ♪ On this day ♪ ♪ We give thanks for the Earth ♪ ♪ For the sea and the sky that was made ♪ ♪ We sing praise ♪ ♪ For the light that brings hope ♪ ♪ And the promise that love guides our way ♪ ♪ We give thanks ♪ ♪ We sing praise ♪ ♪ On this day ♪ ♪ All of heaven rejoices ♪ ♪ And nature proclaims ♪ ♪ Celebrating the grand mystery ♪ ♪ Every flower that blossoms ♪ ♪ And bird that takes wing ♪ ♪ Sings the song in harmony ♪ ♪ They give thanks ♪ ♪ They sing praise ♪ ♪ On this day ♪ That was amazing.

Leif, we should go back. We're not supposed to be here. Come on. What are you afraid of, a dragon? Very funny. Let's just find Hunter quickly. Hunter, come here, boy! Where is that pup? He was chasing that little bird. Look, I can see more tracks. Come on! - What was that? - Huh? - It sounded like Hunter. - Come on! Whoa! Gotcha. That's one mean drop. Sure is. Thanks. Leif, look! Hunter's paw prints end right here. - What? - You don't think... No, it's all right. I can see his tracks on the other side. - Thank goodness. - Yeah. Just one problem: How do we get across? - Whoa! You feel that? - Yeah. Ah! It's an earthquake! Hey, come on, we can get across. Okay, I'm right behind you. - Did you hear that? - It's Hunter! Come on. It's dark in here. Leif, be careful! And hurry! I'm okay. Do you see him? Not yet. This cave is so deep. What's happening down there? Leif? I'm still here, but it's freezing. Whoa! Is everything okay? I don't like this one bit. I can hear him. Getting close. Almost there. I'm coming, boy! Hunter, how'd you get down there? Come on. Hup! Gotcha. Leif, you all right? I'm okay. Thanks, bud. Be careful. Hunter! You had me scared, boy. Are you all right? No more bird-chasing for you. Leif, what was that sound? Some kind of wind or something. Wind coming from inside a cave? Well, what else could it be? Oh, now I get it. You think there's something down there. Look, can we just leave now? As you wish, princess. Let's go, Hunter. It's late. I gotta go. - Me too. - Bye, Leif. There you are. Where have you been? Outside with Hunter, that cute dog, and Leif. I'm getting tired. Must have been all that fresh air. Gonna crash. Love you. Love you too. Hunter, get off me! What? Nicholai, come quick! It's snowing outside. Snow? That's not possible, unless... Unless what? I'm not certain yet, but I'm going to find out. Don't worry. We'll be all right. Can you believe this? This is awesome! It's a snow day in the middle of summer! Yeah! Leif, do you see the snow? Guess where it came from. Uh, let's see, like, maybe the sky? Come on! Don't you remember yesterday, the cave? You don't mean the dragon cave, do you? Leif told us you, like, freaked out. I-I didn't mean to... What, be mean, make fun of me? Hey, we saw that... We didn't see anything, Mel. Look, this is awesome. Come on, let's have some fun! Whee! Leif, wait! Why does he make me so...

I promised Mrs. Potterson I would help her this morning. What's the matter, boy? You miss Melody, don't you? Okay, okay, if you insist. Let's go find her. Ugh, this weather's crazy. This is the worst storm in years. Honey, that's all the firewood we have. - What are we going to do? - I don't know. It's still early. She's probably at Sanctuary with Nicholai. - Are you warm enough, Porky? - The pig's got the right idea. Hey, Leif, where are you off to? Uh, nowhere, really. You know, Hunter just wanted to see Melody, so... Yeah, right. We saw you two holding hands. And singing your little love song. Aw, come on, knock it off, guys. ♪ Maybe not La la la ♪ ♪ Maybe I'm not thinking clear ♪ Very funny. ♪ Maybe ♪ You two were meant for each other. Come on, boy. Yeah, best buds forever, right, Billy? Maybe not. Hey! Hello? Stay here, boy. Hello? Melody! Anyone here? Yes, yes, come in, come in, but you'll find no one here but an old man with his head buried in a book. Oh, hi, Nicholai. I was looking for Melody. Have you seen her? Oh, she should be back soon. She was helping Mrs. Potterson deliver some food to families in the village. The snow day was fun while it lasted, but it's turning into something very different. Yeah, the worst blizzard in years, they say. In a thousand years, I calculate. What are you looking at? Why, it's the song. It is? Let me see. "Giver of all gifts. Love's eternal song. We are here for you." Wait a minute. That's not the song. What do you mean? Well, Melody sang the song in the blue fields, and it was way different. They can't both be the song, can they? Of course they can, for the song has many parts. And though they may sound different at first, if you listen with your heart, you will know they are the same. Different and the same? Precisely! You've got it! Uh, not exactly. Don't worry, Leif. You will get it in time. The words in the song are alive, you see. They are living words. Have a little faith, and you will see. I don't know, Nicholai. I want to believe, but I still have my doubts. That's excellent! A man without a doubt never had a thought. Faith always begins with questions. You're closer to believing than you think. Thanks again for your help, Melody. Sure, Mrs. Potterson. Now, who could've imagined a snowstorm in the middle of summer? Yeah, it's pretty weird. Well, I should be going. Nicholai will be looking for me. Oh, and speaking about your grandfather, everyone got a little carried away in the village the other day. I've been feeling just terrible about it. It's okay, Mrs. Potterson. I'll tell him you said hi. Yes, please do, won't you? Bye. My, my, what a sweet girl. So, tell me, old wall, what secrets do you have for me today? Brick by brick, you're telling me a story, aren't you? Dracon, banished to the depths of a mountain cave, and the people singing the song with thankful hearts. Yes, I see, but there's more, isn't there? Come on, now. Don't be shy. You know, if the villagers could hear me now, having this conversation with you, they'd probably put me away. So show me what is hidden. Speak to me, won't you? What? Wait a minute. What have we here? This is new. If I could just... Now I've done it. No, it can't be. The blue daisies dying, a storm cloud rising from the mountain, and the ice dragon unleashed? I knew it! The dragon is the storm. I must warn the village at once. Drink up, boys. Cheers! Listen up! Nicholai! Join us, friend. No time for that. I'm here to warn you. I've made a discovery in Sanctuary. This storm, it's just the beginning. Beginning of what, endless winter? The return of the ice dragon? The people have moved on from those old fables, Nicholai, and so should you. Go on outside and enjoy the snow day. Have a little fun. It's not a fable, and I'm going to prove it. Please, let us in! Help us! We need shelter. Come in. You're welcome here where it's warm. Nicholai, what should we do? Our home is covered in ice, and we're freezing. Go to Sanctuary. You'll be safe and warm there. Mommy, I'm scared. No! Mommy! It's okay. Mommy's all right. Come on, Hunter, they need our help. Are you okay? I'm all right. - Here, let me help you. - Thank you. We're trying to get to Sanctuary. Nicholai said it would be safe there. He's right. - Now, hold onto Hunter. - I will. It'll be okay. Let's go. Before we all freeze to death! Just a little further. Almost there. Ah... Thank you, Leif. Sure. Get warmed up and let me know if you need anything. The storm is getting nasty out there. I know. People are running out of firewood and food, Leif. I don't know what to do. Have you seen Nicholai? No, I haven't. I saw him leave for the mountains, the crazy old fool. What? Oh, no. Melody, I'm scared of the storm. What was that? It's only the wind. I'm sorry. She's just frightened. We all are. That's okay.

What's happening? What are those things? I'm not sticking around to find out. Come on! Hey, guys, why is everyone running? Some kind of wolves. Keep running. I'll make mincemeat out of 'em. That's right, come on. Open the door! Let us in! Let us in! - Did you see that? - What are those things? - Monsters! - Hurry, get inside! Hunter, no, stay! Why aren't they attacking? It's like they're waiting for something. Look at that cloud. It's weird, like something's inside it. I have a bad feeling about this. Leif! Get inside! Now! We've gotta shut these doors. They're stuck, frozen to the ground! No, it can't be true. Oh, no. What are you doing? I'm saving you. Get inside! Leif! It's the ice dragon! - The what? - It's coming this way! - Ice dragon! - Leif? Hey, dragon! I've seen your picture. You're much uglier in person. Maybe you're beautiful on the inside. Then again, maybe not. We have to break this ice! The door is frozen shut! Hunter, calm down. We'll get out to help Leif as soon as they break the ice. Here goes. Whoa, whoa! Ohh! Ah, come on! Okay, take it easy. Nice werewolf, doggy creature thingies. Back! Back! Oh, you're scared of the sword, aren't you? Get out of here! That wasn't so bad. Huh? Hunter, what'd you find, boy? Found a way out. Why, I... Come on. Hey, what are you doing here?
