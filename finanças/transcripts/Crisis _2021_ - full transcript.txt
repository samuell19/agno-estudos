Don't shoot! Don't shoot! I'm not armed! I need you to shave a week off that. Yeah, all right. Gentleman. We have to talk. The Canadians. Their kid got snagged at the border. What, the courier? Cedric. He's all over the news. Jesus. How the fuck did that happen? We don't know how the fuck that happened. But apparently there's a great amount of anxiety bouncing around now. Where are they holding the kid? Montreal detention center. Maybe I know someone inside there. Should this Cedric get an itch to name names- - No, he's not gonna name any fucking names. Good, because that would be unpleasant for everyone. - What the fuck? - What? I've been in there for half an hour. Yeah, there was traffic. Did you recycle at the Conway off-ramp? Yeah, are you getting paranoid again? Don't start with that paranoid shit. Jesus. - Sorry, okay? - Drive better. I'll do my level best. I'll be back in an hour. Hey. Hey. Your sister's in the TV room. Thanks. Who knows? Another time, another place. Hey, small fry. Doctor said you got 19 days. I'm almost finished with my deal. And I figure when we're done, we can go for a drive up to the lake. We can have breakfast. I mean, fuck, we could even bring Mom. What do you think? - She's taking methadone? - Yes. Anything else? Mild sedatives. She was violent. And there's some hearing loss, about 40% in her right ear. Hopefully it'll stop. Why's that happening? We don't know. We see it sometimes. We think the opiates damage the nerves in the ear canals. I'm... Claire. I'm an addict. Drug of choice, oxy. Um, I heard Ron talking about doctor shopping and it brought back some nice memories. Not as good as the memory of, um, this one time when I really needed a fix and my doctor wouldn't write me any scripts anymore. And uh, I still had the cast from my original accident, so I put my wrist in the car door and I, so I could, you know, get a script. I have an amazing 16-year-old son and I can't even sit through a hockey game without... Without thinking about it. I would like to be a better person for him, and I am working on that every day. Did you bring the slip? - I did. - Come here. - How are you? - How was school? - Pretty good. - Good. Thank you. All right, um, your aunt's coming over for dinner tonight, so on your way home from practice, can you please stop by the store and pick up some tortillas? I'm gonna make fajitas tonight. Oh, you're cooking? Are you teasing? You say you're ordering a pizza? What did you say? I'll get them. - Thank you. - Love you. I love you. With our product, Klaralon, we never cross the blood-brain barrier, so we block the receptors from the reinforcement mechanism and this greatly diminishes possibility of addiction. A patient takes one dose twice a day and the incidence of addictive behavior is less than a quarter that of oxycodone. Klaralon will be the first truly non-addictive painkiller. Ladies and gentlemen, this is the holy grail. So, let's drink from the cup. And what's been forgotten today, in our rush to judgment, is that in the field of observation, chance favors the prepared mind. Now, who said that? Uh, Alexandra. Louis Pasteur. Louis Pasteur, he said that, yes indeed. And he lived it. For 30 years, he worked in pursuit of a singular goal. Now, many will tell you that anyone who works for 30 years on anything without results is uh, insane. But isn't the very definition of insanity here just another word for focus? Because without us crazies, I mean, where would the world be? Okay, what is next? No, I understand that, Bill. I just wanna double check our results here for you, make sure nothing is off. I'm sure your work is good as usual, but you know, we're really getting behind here. Just, just bear with me. Everything will be fine. Look, we've given you a lot of business over the years, Tyrone, and you always come through, but if you want me to call David Nunez at UCLA and ask him to pick up some of the testing work- - No, no, no, there's no need for that. I promise, Bill, it will be ready. - Hey, Reeva. - Hey. Do you have the results from the Northlight study? Yeah, I'm sorry, Doctor. I'm just double checking them. They should be ready by tonight. Is everything all right with it? Yeah. Well, I'll know shortly. Okay, well, let me know as soon as it's done. Now, new GS is up from Washington, name of Garrett. She wants a full report. So, what, you couldn't explain it to her? I could, but she wanted the agent in charge. That's you, isn't it? - What's happening, fellas? - How you living, Slim? Oh, can't complain. So, what's the deal? You know anyone who's worked with her before? Yeah, me, actually, back when I was in Virginia. You did? Doing what? Well, she was a field agent before she became a supervisor. Field agent? Thought you've always been a desk jockey. I guess there's things you don't know about me after all, Mr. Kelly. Thank God. Let's keep it that way. The operation itself is pretty straightforward. We just set up our own pill mill. That's where the oxy gets distributed? Uh, almost. No, that's where we hire the corrupt doctors. These doctors are really strung out. They're on their last legs. And the patients come in and the doctors write them a prescription for oxy whether they need it or not. Uh, where are these patients coming from? Cappers. - Those are your recruiters? - Uh, yes, ma'am. Like one source we're developing named Red. He goes to homeless shelters and recruits people to come to our clinic and pays them $100 a visit. Listen, man, you wanna make some dough? Hell yeah. What you need, bro? He tries to find people with Medicare cards, and then brings them to us one van load at a time. Patients can even show a dog x-ray and walk out with pills. Looks like you're in bad pain. You good with oxy 80s? And uh, 30 Somas too, right? And what about your partners, the Armenians? Yeah, Armen Matosyan and Minas Soghomonyan. They're AP13, it's a loose collection of Armenian power gangsters. Are we selling drugs? Uh, no, ma'am. No, the homeless get the pills at the pharmacies and then we buy them back from them right then and there. So, why open up your own mill? To buy credibility. The only way Jake could get close enough to the Armenians to build trust was to show cash flow, and it took a year of undercover work to get this far. So, $600k of taxpayer money, you have corrupt doctors, cappers, and some Armenians. Why not make a bust? Because it's not about oxy anymore. The new killer is fentanyl. And as everyone in this room already knows, it's 100 times more potent than heroin, and it's being shipped from a syndicate in China to Canada, and then smuggled into America across the wide open border. The Armenians control most of the coastal city oxy distribution. Now they wanna control fentanyl. If Jake can bring the Armenians and the Canadians together, we can take everybody down. Hello? Hi, Sam. It's David's mom, Claire. Oh, hi, Ms. Reimann. Yeah, have you seen David? No, I didn't go to practice today. It's just he's not home yet and I don't know. Did you try the coach? No, I'll do that. Yeah, I'll do that. - Okay. - Okay. - Thank you. - Bye. What about the foundation grant? Ah, trust me, you'd be the first to know. Learning to live with cutbacks, I suppose there's an art in that. Oh, so I guess that raise is out, then? Nobody is getting a raise. Well, maybe you are when you come back this fall from maternity leave. I thought you were gonna spend time with the baby. Well, it's hard for three to live off love, right? Geoff's helping a little. Hopefully he'll help a lot. More wine, please. What kind of artist would you wanna be, then? - Hey, Reeva. - Hi, Doctor. - Are you still at dinner? - Yeah. - I - finished the study, but there's something concerning me. Well, what exactly? I'd rather discuss it in person. Can it wait? Not really. Can you come to the lab? - What, now? - I think it'd be best. Um. Yeah. Yeah, okay. All right, I'm on my way. And I said to the client, "The most important choice that you're going to make to define your brand is the typography." And the client looks at the team and says to us- Coach Vogel, hi. Thank you for calling me back. Yes, Ms. Reimann. Yeah, David, he was at practice today. He left at around five. Said he had to stop by the store on his way home. Okay. Um, and that was the last you heard from him? Yes, ma'am. I'm sure he'll be there soon. Thank you. What? I'm going by the store. Okay, I'll come. Would he have gone to a friend's? No. I mean, I don't know. Well, what's he up to these days? Same thing. Sports. - Anything else? - Like what? I don't know. - What are you suggesting? - I'm not saying anything. He's a good kid, all right? Well, maybe he has a girlfriend. No, he would've told me. You've gotta be fucking kidding me. Garrett said it's time to make some busts. The president wants a political win and this could be it. So, what, she can't wait at all? She'll pay for two more weeks. Could you connect the Canadians and the Armenians by then? And find the fentanyl labs, and take everyone down, dead to rights, with no support? It's either that or they scuttle it. You know, she even wanted the Chinese connection, but I told her we'd be chasing ghosts. Two weeks, um... Yeah, yeah, I can make that work. I gotta get out of here. I gotta get up there. - Okay, uh, walk me out. - Yeah. Hey, what happened with that kid up at the border, Cedric? What the fuck was that? Well, RCMP must've got onto him somehow. Yeah, how? We're the only ones who knew about the run. I don't know, maybe they have a leak somewhere? They're not saying much. We've worked too hard to let a bunch of Mounties fuck this up. Where are they keeping the kid anyway? Uh, they're moving him to WITSEC. He's gonna testify he was smuggling on behalf of the Montreal syndicate. And that means Mother. Fuck. That means it's only a matter of time before Mother gets to him and anyone else who knew about this. Yeah, Jake, you really think this is realistic? I mean, the Montreal piece. You're right, you don't have a deep rep with Mother. Maybe it's dangerous to press a big sale now. Yeah, but what fucking choice do we have? - I, I don't know. - Seriously? We need to find him. So many people come through here. Yeah, so, somebody had to have seen him, right? Ma'am, I don't know. Yeah, I know you don't know, - but somebody knows. - Claire. What? You've gotta calm down. No, I'm not gonna calm down. Is everything all right here? No. Everything's not all right. I'm, I'm looking for my son. All right, we wanna help. We're gonna find him. - All right? - Thank you. Thank you. Sorry, I didn't... Sorry. Okay. This is sugar water. And where's the drug? This is 182 over here. Yeah. I guess Northlight hasn't quite cracked that blood-brain issue yet, huh? Eh, well, they'll be disappointed. Doctor, you asked us to use Klaralon as a baseline. Yeah, yeah, it's a good control. Well, we did, and we ran it for 10 days as well. Uh. I don't understand you, uh, you ran 182 twice? No, Doctor, this isn't 182. We gave these mice Klaralon. This is Klaralon at day 10. What the hell is going on? We were contracted to do a 7-day study, and I elected to use our standard 10-day protocol to yield a more informative result. Now, everything was fine throughout the seventh day, but on day eight, you can see what started happening. The mice keep seeking the drug. They stay only in the drug dispensing area. - Until they die. - Exactly. You can see from the fMRI scans that all the addiction centers in their brains are lighting up. And then by day 10, they're dead. That goes for P182 and Klaralon. This can't be right. Apart from the extra days of experiment, everything ran according to protocol. Well, then run it again. We can't afford to deliver an unprofessional result. I'm sorry, unprofessional? Northlight is already into the final stage of human trials with Klaralon. We're just looking into their new formulation. There's no way Klaralon is this toxic, it's about to be approved by the FDA! We followed the protocol exactly. Then recheck it. Everything! The drug, the mice. Even the damn cages. Contract research covers all our funding. If word gets out that we don't know what we're doing, we're, we're done, we're finished. Of course, Doctor. We ran a standard replicate study and it'll be ready with you first thing. Great. And call me as soon as. There. That's him right there. That's 5:21 p.m. Uh, looks like he bought some tortillas, - hot sauce, paid cash. - Yeah. Can you follow him outside? He exited through the south door, got on his bike, looks like, and then. And then what? I'm afraid that's it. There's only one camera on that side of the building. Hello? That's fine. - What's fine? - Okay, we'll come now. Let's go. - They just, um, they- - What? Unit 26, this is central. 2-11 in progress, the corner of Cass and Henry. - Suspect is a male black- - What is it? What's going on? - Are you Ms. Reimann? - Please tell me - what's going on. - She's Claire Reimann. I'm afraid there's been an accident. - Your son, David. - Yeah. He's gone, ma'am. What? What do you mean? He's gone where? He's dead. I'm sorry. Mother? Wanna drink something? A beer? - Labatt? - Sure. Thanks. - Hey, listen, I wanna- - Wait for the beer. Correc'? The way I see it, the question before us is, why? Why was the boy stopped at the border? And the logical answer is, someone knew he was crossing. Now, who knew that? Your people knew that. My guys wouldn't talk. Well, somebody had to tip this off. It's an unpatrolled stretch of our southern border. Can't be caught without informant. But, Mother, my associates, and you've met them, they're Armenian. They would rather die than talk to the police. Look, Jake, I like you. You've been a good customer, buying a little batch here, there, but this larger plan now seems to be beyond your capabilities. These boys, they worked well for us until we delivered to you. Now we have a bust. And who knows how many they're pressuring. Okay, I agree. Things haven't necessarily gone smoothy so far, but- - Smooth? Are you stupid or what? Maybe for now you keep your head down, focus on what you know. Couriers aren't the only way. My guys run trucks through the entire United States. So, you take the product to a warehouse, you package it as vitamins, then they come in their trucks and pick it up. Well, tell me, what's gonna happen when they get to customs? NAFTA. You take it to a Foreign Trade Zone where the police can't do inspections, only customs agents can, and they're not gonna open every single bottle of sealed vitamins. Before we trust, as your President Reagan used to say, we must verify. We must learn why it did happen. Oui. We're gonna talk to our guy at customs. It's right there. You sure? Yeah. Oh, god. We won't have toxicology for a few days, but a paramedic in the alley said it was an overdose. Oxycodone. What? He was foaming at the mouth when they arrived. They tried Narcan to revive him, but it was too late. Were you aware of any issues with your son? Like what? - Drug issues. - No. Absolutely not. Any idea where he would get pills? Uh, my, my sister had an accident a while ago. Sue. And there were some painkillers lying- - Sue. There were some painkillers around. Those pills have been gone for months. Sometimes children steal these pills. David wasn't doing drugs, I would've known. I understand. Is it a single parent household? What are you getting at? Just come out and say it to me. Otherwise what are you gonna do about it? We're gonna continue to monitor the situation. And? And see if anything comes up. - What does that mean? - I, I, Claire- - No, what does that... What the fuck does that mean, see if anything comes up? Are you out there looking? I'm sorry, I love you so much. Right now the department is treating this as an accidental death. Accidental? You don't even know what happened. Ms. Reimann, we have 40 overdoses this week, here in Detroit alone. That's more than homicides. This isn't anything against your son. It's a terrible drug. I'm sorry. We have his belongings for you. We just need you to sign for them. So, this is the replicate study I brought in, and it shows exactly the same result. Biological explanation? We'd need a mass spec to see how the liver's metabolizing, not to mention many more basic experiments. We're talking six months of work at least. Mm, that's not gonna fly with Northlight. Something in the drug is crossing the blood-brain barrier and hitting the reward centers, but Klaralon is supposed to reduce dependence, not increase it threefold. How could they not have caught this? Well, write up your findings. We should get this over to Northlight right away. How did the border agents know to stop the boy? You tell me. You're supposed to be our ears of the patrols. - I heard rumors. - What? Someone's talking, in your house. That's ridiculous. It's true. There's a list. What list? - And who are you? - Never mind that. - Answer the fucking question. - Hey, whoa. Whoa, relax. You know a guy named Davison? The cop that was disgraced, facing corruption charges? Yeah. When Internal Affairs got onto him, they heard about a list he kept at the major crimes bureau, Over 200 names on it. Every informant from every crew he ever worked with. I bet that on that list is your informant. Where's the list now? I heard he's trying to sell it. Where? I'm just a custom inspector. Can't you find him? All right, get out. Get the fuck out! See, I told you, he's garbage. We gotta find that list. Hi, this is Dr. Meg Holmes. Please leave a message. So, in recognition of that great bounty, our foundation is pleased to announce tonight a five-year $30 million commitment to the building of this new contemporary art wing. Once FDA approves, we will bring Klaralon to market in six months. And in the spirit of gift giving you demonstrated tonight, here on page three are the sales projections. Wow, those are, uh... Wow. Physician response is tremendous. When our dad built Northlight, his dream was not just to make money, it was to make the world a better place. An addiction-free painkiller was always his goal, and you found it. You've done our family proud, Meg. It was only possible through your support, gentlemen. I'm pleased we were able to deliver for you. Will you excuse me? - Of course. - Sure. Hello? Meg? It's Bill. We've got an issue. How long has he been a resource? Eight years. He's always stamped whatever we put in front of him. So where'd this come from? A mistake, apparently. As you can see, he ran the study twice with the same results. I've been saying we take it under advisement. But now Tyrone's recommending we share his data with a panel of scientists and present it at a conference for further study? I thought you were on top of this. How do you wanna handle it? Davison. Apparently he's in a motel downtown trying to make a sale of the list. $200k. - So, what's the move? - I arranged a meet. You guys go down there. Motel Arlequin. Room 206. If the list is good, you buy it. - For 200k? - I front the money. We can turn it around to the other crews, make a profit, too. Or you can use the list to eliminate your competition. See, I told you he's smart. You could learn something from this man. I'll be by your hotel tomorrow. Google's made it more difficult for some phones with two-factor authentication. Can you unlock it? This will brute-force some codes by overriding the lockout. It might take a minute. Okay, let's see. Bingo. You're lucky, it was a four-digit code. 3959. Thanks, Ted. It's not that we don't appreciate it. Northlight just has a lot of studies to look at. Was there something wrong with our work? No, no, your work is excellent. And that's why they authorized me to award you a grant of $780,000 for continued funding of your other research. Wow. This is very generous of you, Bill. It would mean a lot to the lab. If you'll just sign these modification papers we can process the grant as part of the new set up. Should be able to get your funds within a week. All right. Um, let me look over these and I'll get back to you. It's pretty standard stuff. Just wanna get you up and running quickly, you know? Get this thing moving. Yeah, yeah. Um, I'll have them read by the morning. Fair enough? Yeah, yeah. You bet. Wow, this is amazing. - Thank you, Bill. - Thank you. Good to see you, Bill. - Tomorrow. - Oh yeah, for sure. What's this guy's deal? Never mind that. He's a piece of shit. All right. Looks like being an informant doesn't pay what it used to. - 206? - 206. Fuck. How much you wanna bet the list was on the fucking laptop? Let's get the hell out of here. Who took the list? How the fuck would we know that? Fuck! Okay. What do we do now? Nothing. The deal goes down as planned. Nah, no way. It's too risky. The Armenians can be trusted. I don't know. I think we should just wait and see if- - They want 3 million. - Street value? - No. Raw fentanyl, at your price. Still, the timing feels wrong. Look, I'll guarantee the cash. Right to the switch point. And you have no distribution exposure. And even if there is a snitch, as long as it's kept between Mother, you, and me, no one will find out about it. Fuck, I'll think it over. You'd better hurry, 'cause we can buy elsewhere. Ah, fuck. Just drive the fucking car. After you hired me, I read the police report. It said that your son died from an overdose of oxycodone 80-milligram pills, ingested and inhaled. Yeah, I know. I read the report. Well, here's the thing. There's no smoke in his lungs. No smoke? And from the pink condition of his lungs, I'd say he didn't smoke ever. Further, there's severe bruising on the back of his head. What are you saying? Either your son took 10 80-milligram oxys on his first try - this night on his way home- - Or what? Someone hit him over the head and forced him to swallow them? Is that... How could the cops miss that? Cops miss a lot of things. I know, I used to be one. How did he die? As I said, the indication is- - No, I mean, how? What was it like for him? Do you really wanna know? I need to know. And with that, I bid you, go forth and bring me a breakthrough. Bonne chance! Hey, Geoff. You have fun the other night? I did. Now, honestly, did I overcook the fish? Honestly, I thought it was chicken. What's up? Well, I heard about this situation with Northlight, the pharmaceutical study. One of the trustees know somebody on their board. Yeah? Well, as you know, I'm not a big fan of these arrangements. Well, we've never had a problem before. Well, no, but I have. The situation is not unique to you, Ty. I got a lot of teachers that pay their rent with these corporate studies, which means I'm often asked to look the other way on the inherent conflicts. Added to which, Northlight is one of the school's major donors. That's not fair and you know it. I'm not trying to make waves for you, Geoff. Well, then, you can see why we don't wanna make a federal case out of this thing. I understand they want you to sign something. Have you read it? I've read enough of it. Well, then you will know that they want me to sign a statement saying we made significant errors, that we cannot be relied upon, which is as bizarre a request as I have ever seen. Who cares if it's bizarre? It's a confidential agreement. We have been a good source for them for eight years, and the one time, the one time, that my results contradict theirs, all of a sudden they want an expanded confidentiality agreement? Geoff, you know what this is about. No, we're not jumping to any conclusions here, okay? Our job is to be educators, not to grapple with big pharma. Let's just think about signing what it is they want and we can be done with this. Hey, it's Simon. Please leave a message. Hey. Hey. Hey, what do you want? I'm uh, I'm, I'm David's mother. - David Reimann. - Yeah, I know. Then why did you walk away from me? I don't know. On his phone there was a bunch of missed calls from you. What did you want? - We were friends. - No. You weren't my son's friend. If you were, I would've known your name. - Simon, are you okay? - Yeah, he's fine. Why don't you leave him alone? Come with me. Look, we hung out a couple of times, it wasn't a big deal. So, then, what did you want with him? I mean, I wasn't his friend exactly. Um, Cedric was. Cedric Beauville? From the hockey camp? You went to Montrose? Yeah. Look, all I know is that Cedric needed him and he told me to find him. Wait. Where can I find Cedric? - You didn't hear? - What? - It was on the news. - What? Look, I really don't know anything. I only ran for them once. It wasn't a big deal. You ran drugs? Come with me. All right, all right. Look, look, it was Derrick up in Montreal. He runs a lot of oxy there. Just please don't tell him I said anything. Nobody's heard anything from the Armenians on the wires. If you don't get them to buy from Mother soon, it's all gonna fall apart. I really think you gotta get back here. Okay, I'm on my way back. Jake, we're running out of time. Yeah, I said I'm on my way. I'll be there when I'm there. Oui. Just spoke to my guys. They're good to go. Are we on? Yeah, we're on. But one thing. You come alone. What, and carry everything out on my back? No. My guys bring in trucks. After you pay. No way. All right, then forget it. Okay, I bring in a million as a deposit, but I wanna see the goods. After that, my guys come in and they bring the rest. That's it. Yes or no? Yes. Good. But I'm coming with big money, so I wanna see your operation first. I need to know that you can actually step up and handle this. I'll talk to Mother. Look, it's just bad. Now the feds are tracking prescriptions, the smart move is walk away. Yeah, that's why we're walking away from the pill mill business and getting into fentanyl. Mother's ready. Too much heat. For all we know, we're under surveillance right now. Look, if we pussy out now- - Pussy out? Not a very sophisticated way to look at it. Maybe we should listen to Armen and walk. On the other hand, the demand is high, and the junkies are fiends for this. Maybe it's worth the risk. If we go a million a piece we can turn 3 million into 30. I don't have a million. Fuckin' Maserati Minas over there does. He's rich. Borrow some from him. What a brave fellow you are, Jake. We'll let you know tomorrow. RCMP say they've arrested Cedric Beauville. The 18-year-old was crossing this snowy, unpatrolled stretch of the border wearing camouflage. Authorities say he set off the alarm at the Saint-Armand crossing where he was caught with over half a million dollars of fentanyl pills. The pills are a public health menace and are popular among younger drug users. Beauville is being held at the federal detention center in Montreal, Quebec. - So, you weren't contracted to work with Klaralon. How'd you get it? I don't follow. The drug Klaralon. It's not on market yet. How'd you get it? From the chemistry department. I asked them to make me some. Based on the patent literature, you had our chemistry department synthesize it for you? Yeah, we do it all the time, Geoff. You know that. And now based on your results, you want Northlight to pull their billion dollar drug, a drug that's just about to hit the market, off the market for some further testing. The results show co-valent bonds- - Chris, can you talk to him about the liability? Yeah. The original agreement that you signed eight years ago already contained a confidentiality provision. You still can't share your findings with anyone. Well, that's insane. This is a public health issue. Dammit, Tyrone, we don't know that at all! And just so you know, Northlight spoke to a number of your clients and they also had strange results from your labs. - What clients? - And when pressed further, many of them had significant questions about your testing methodology. If people are accusing me of being unprofessional, I think I have a right to know. If you leak Northlight's data, the university can be liable. And we're talking about Northlight, a multibillion-dollar manufacturer from three generations of one of the richest families on the planet, a family that, I think we can all agree, has done a lot of good in the world. Oh, have they? If we knew about oxycodone then and could've spoken, look at all the harm we could've prevented, the lives we could've saved. If you take it upon yourself to publish Northlight's proprietary data- - Dr. Brower, you could even be liable for criminal charges. A crime? For telling the truth? - I don't believe it. - Believe it! Tyrone, you know I respect you, but I need you to promise that you won't share this data with anyone. Tenure's not forever, you know? Neither is your reputation. What is that supposed to mean? You bring shame upon this university and it can cost you a hell of a lot more than your teaching job. You have reached the Gratiot Police Department after hours. If you have the extension of the party you'd like to reach- - This is always the way. First it was tobacco, then it was oxy. Now it's your turn. Dangerous territory. If this carries over to the human trials, not only is this painkiller not non-addictive, it's three times more addictive than oxy. They're in the final stages of their FDA submission. If your report became public, they'd have to withdraw their request for approval, all for some mice that are outside the scope of the agreed protocol? And nobody cares. I could always take it somewhere. Where? How about the FDA? Tyrone, this is not something you wanna bring upon yourself lightly. You've gotta have a plan. A plan? For telling the truth? Don't be naive. Sometimes that's not enough. And we've both done a lot of contract work is this really the worst you've ever seen? The worst. Then be careful. Yeah, to a T. Yes, sir. Thank you. I can't believe I'm doing this. But you'll approve it? If you guys get the Armenians on board, I can authorize a mil in flash money. Yes. But the whole op is gonna have to be supervised. We won't have advance notice to get cameras in. You can use surveillance vans, can't you? - Absolutely. - Yes. Yes. All right. Stan, you're willing to go out in the field with him? Yes. Okay, sign right there. Anything happens to that money, it's your asses. Nothing's gonna happen to the money. - Excuse me one second. - I guaran-fucking-tee it. Hello? Hi, is this Mr. Kelly? Yeah, this is him. Yes, I'm calling from Gables Treatment to let you know that your sister has checked herself out. What? Mom, how much did she get? Well, it looks like all of it, Jake. Are you gonna go to the pawn shops? Pawn shops were open hours ago. I'm passing the buy spots now. I'll call you when I get her. Hey, Jake, man. What up, dog? Yo, yo, you all right? Where is she? - Is that it? - Yeah. How many people are in there with her? I don't know, man, I don't go in there. Come on. Get the fuck out of here. Fuck. - Get your hands off me. - It's okay. It's okay, come on. - Come on. - Hey. - Come on, Emmie. - Hey. - Come on. - What are you doing? Get your hands off me. Hey. Sit the fuck down. - It's okay. - Hey, get your hands off me. Get your fucking hands off me, Jake! - It's okay. - No! - No! - It's okay. Get your fucking hands off me! Get your hands off me now, you're fucking... Help! Dr. Brower. I'm Ben Walker, from the FDA. May I sit? - Do you have some ID? - Yes. I'm glad you reached out. Well, I read your report. Who else knows about this? Northlight, obviously. The university. They're not happy with me. There's some things I need to ask you about. Go ahead. I understand there was an issue of sexual harassment some years back? - With a student? - Oh, Jesus. You really have been checking up on me. I was cleared. But what was it? It was nothing. A remark I made one night in the lab and it got blown out of proportion. The tenure committee didn't think so. - You were censured. - I was cleared! You've gotta prepare yourself. Will the FDA take action? I'm not gonna lie to you. Science at this level is often a matter of interpretation. This is not interpretation, this is data. What I'm saying is, until now you've mainly been a validator, taking the money and letting the studies play themselves. Well, that's pretty cynical. I like to think I did a little more than that. Through your own research, maybe, but as far as your outside contracts- - Who the hell are you? Some bureaucrat with a plastic badge. You're here because I pressed the button, and you wanna ridicule me. They're gonna come after you. They'll say you're a drunk. I'm not a drunk. And a bad scientist, undistinguished, whatever they can think of. But what you're doing now may be the most important thing you ever do. - Come on, out. - Get off me. Don't fucking touch me. Oh, you're taking me back to Mom now? You're gonna fucking tell on me? Is that it? Do you have any idea what you're doing to Mom? Mommy. - Look what he did to me. - In the house. - Jake, handcuffs? - Jake, these really hurt, I'm telling you. - Take them off. - Mom, don't start. - It's our house. - Listen. - You gonna relax? - Yes. - Can you behave? - Yes. Take it off, please. Thank you. Fuck you! - Are you fucking kidding me? - Fuck you! God. What is wrong with you? - It's my fucking life! - Give me your hands. You can't help me. You think you can fucking help me like this? - Ow, you're hurting me! - What the fuck is wrong with you? - Fuck you! - Why are you like this? What the fuck is wrong with you? - You're a fucking disgrace! - Look what you just did to me. You're a fucking disgrace. Mom! - I fucking hate you both! - Mom. - Mom. - You hear me? - Mom. - I hate you! You leave her there for two days, okay? - Be strong. - Okay. I love you. Love you. You said it was non-addictive. It is. Brower's study is outside the prescribing scope. It's not apples to apples. So, what, you're saying that if they take it within the 30-day window prescribed they won't get addicted? Yeah, that's right. And if they take it longer than that? Some patients might develop dependence, but that's only if they abuse it by taking it too long. Well, do you have a plan? Discredit Brower. We have already found things from his past. - What things? - Indiscretions. They're in the dossier. And remember, we have successful human trials. He's just holding up one animal study. He'll quiet down. I think it's time we got more involved. Shit. Oh. Sorry? May I help you? Oh, no, I think I'm in the wrong place. Thank you. No, no, no, maybe you're at the right place. - No. - No? - But thank you. - All right. Really, sorry. I see you've read the news. I know it's not true. Oh, there's some truth to it. I did ask her out. It was before I met Madira. It was after my divorce. I was still drinking, and she was a student. And I shouldn't have. Doctor, I know you. Whatever you think, I know you. You've gotta stay strong. Thank you. Night. Goodnight. Yeah? Dr. Brower? This is Jane Williams, secretary to the tenure committee. We're calling to inform you that a meeting has been scheduled and you need to be present. I'll be there. You seem like a trustworthy man, Jake. How does it go down? It happens in a warehouse in Montreal. I show up with my share, my million, and I verify the product. Once I do, I call you. You come in with trucks. You're going into the buy alone? Mother's paranoid. It's the only way he'd do it. How do you know they won't just beat your ass and take the money? Well, I guess I don't. Either big, brave balls on you, Jake, or you're an idiot. You just stay close. Once I verify the merchandise, I'll call you. Maybe you are an idiot. You know what? Fuck you, Minas. I thought you had big balls. Careful. We're in. Yeah? Your rental car's in slot D4. It's untraceable. Now, did you have a PI run a VIN number belonging to Guy Broussard? No, of course not. Why? Someone in a Montreal precinct checked the plate, emailed owner records to an outside cell phone. It's registered to some local private investigator. You get the location? Yeah. I'm tracking his phone now. I'll send you a link. All right. I ran the VIN number. That him? Yeah. His name is Guy Broussard. He's the number two of the operation. Works for a man called Mother. Mother? - Yeah. - That's his name? Real name is Claude Veroche. He owns a bar called La Marina. This is the man in charge? He looks like a respectable citizen, right? The file tells a different story. Been arrested for distribution, manufacturing. Did four years for manslaughter. He's also been linked to several unsolved homicides. What about the other thing? It's a ghost gun. It's untraceable. Safety's on the trigger, so if I were you- - I know how to shoot. Good. What are you planning to do, exactly? Thank you. You can go now. You be careful. Jake, what's up? Yeah, I got a plate for you. Michigan plate, 23458 QV, Quebec Victor. Run the ownership records on that. Tell me what you find. Yeah, I'll do it right now. All right. The owner is Claire Reimann, an architect. Couple of arrests, one for possession, one for DUI. - Narcotics possession? - Yeah. Uh, hold on, there's something else. Oh, her son just died. OD'd on oxy. Jesus. Yeah, she was making some noise about wanting an investigation. Was her son involved in anything? Uh, don't know. They think he was clean. Well, what's his deal? Any interests? A sports star, looking at scholarships. Wait a minute. Winter sports? Jesus. - Cedric! - Yeah. What do you wanna bet they knew each other? You know I didn't harass anybody. That is all Northlight. We can't have any contact until the tenure hearing. It's against the rules. Dragging my name through the mud, is that part of the rules? Keep your voice down. Come with me. Your whole goddamn career, you basically just took the money and you, you, you stamped it all through. Isn't that about right? And now you grow a conscience. - People here like you! - Yeah, except maybe you. - That is so unfair. - Don't you get what Northlight is doing? This is the biggest public health crisis since tobacco! We can't just turn a blind eye! We can't weather it! We barely have enough funding to get by. You understand that? And I'm responsible for thousands of students, - and faculty, and- - Oh, Geoff, this drug is gonna fucking kill people. Just like oxy, just like fentanyl! - You don't know that! - You don't see it, do you? You don't see it. This just doesn't go back in the bottle. We're a university, we're not the FDA. It's not our responsibility- - Then whose is it? Sign what it is they want. Maybe you'll get your lab back. Get your life back. Don't throw it all away, Tyrone. You're not gonna win this. This is the mixer. It blends the powder base with the fentanyl. This one takes the fentanyl powder and presses it into pills. This is the counter machine. Pills go in, pills go out and drop directly into your vitamin bottle. Street value is $30 per pill. That's impressive. What's your situation now? My guys will be here in three days. Good. So, now you've seen. We're gonna be ready. Oh, and also, uh, we took care of that other problem. What problem? Cedric. The courier. - Yeah? - Yep. That son of a bitch is gone. Yeah. We also found out who the informant was after all. Oh, you did? Oui. Good, good. And who was it? Well, you knew all along, it was you, Tabernac! He killed Davison in the hotel room before you got there. He stole the laptop because he knew his name was on it. He was an RCMP snitch. How, how- Here. We went to his house. We find the laptop there. But your name wasn't on it. That was good news for you, my friend. But now you know the stakes. Anything happens, we can touch you anywhere in the world, no matter who you are. So, are we still on? Yeah. Fuck. Sit down, now! Please don't shoot me. Did you have my son killed? - Please don't shoot. - Did you have my son killed? - Who? - David. David Reimann. I told them he didn't know anything. He just came along on one run. You had my son run drugs for you? No. - It wasn't like that. - Then what was it like? Huh? We met at camp. I asked him to come along on a trip with some friends. I hid the pills in David's bag. He never even knew what he was carrying. So, then, why did they kill him? Why not you? I don't know! I didn't know they were gonna kill anybody. You didn't know who was gonna kill anybody? Mother. Word is after Cedric got busted, he got completely paranoid and started cutting loose ends. I'm probably next. Please don't shoot me. Please. Please. - Is it true? - Is what true? Did they kill the kid? Cedric. I'm afraid so. They found him foaming at the mouth at the foot of his cell. Somebody got to his food. There's another kid dead here, too. What kid? Simon Gilcrest. OD'd on oxy like the Reimann boy. We don't know how they're linked yet. He was probably another courier. We think they all went to the same camp. Guy's dead, too. What? - How? - Mother. Just now. I was fucking standing right next to him. I think we reconsider the meet. No. Jake, remember what happened when Benny Alvarez messed with these guys? They're still pulling pieces of his body out of the river. Do you think I don't fucking know that? Huh? Do you have any idea what I just went through? They're doing multiple homicides. You cannot walk into that buy alone. - Mother said that- - Fuck Mother! Is he worth your life? We can't quit. We can't stop. At least let me have some advance warning to cover you, okay? Even 40 minutes. Okay, yeah. I'll text you the meet location as soon as I get it, and you coordinate with RCMP. But they can't fuck this up. I'm on it. Okay, and be flexible. The meet location could change at any minute. I went by the school today. Why didn't you tell me what was happening? I'm sorry, I... I tried to take care of it, and, it got so much bigger. I guess I overestimated myself. But why didn't you share it with me? Do you think I couldn't handle it? No, no. I didn't wanna worry you. I wanted to protect you. Oh, come on. We're in this together. And you have a responsibility. Yeah, to our family. To something larger than that. If they let me go now, under these circumstances, I just can't turn around and find another job. I really don't know what to do. We will manage. We will. We always do. Yeah? I'm sorry. Um, Bill. It's, uh, Tyrone. I've thought about your proposal. Um. Uh, let's come to an arrangement. Hello? Claire, I've been trying to call you. Your car's not in the driveway. Where are you? I'm traveling. Traveling? Where? Listen, Sue, I can't really talk right now, okay? - I- - What are you doing, Claire? - Sue. - Claire. I know that this is hell. You know, the doctor said it took four minutes for his heart to give out. It took him four minutes to stop breathing. Four minutes his heart was constricting in his chest, like someone was strangling him until he died. Claire. I'm sorry. Claire. Claire. - Dr. Brower. - Yes. How are you? I'm Sarah, Dr. Simons' assistant. - Hi. - Follow me, please. Thank you. Did you find everything okay? Yeah, thanks. It's uh, quite a place, huh? Yeah. I'm lucky to call it my office. Tyrone. Bill. These are the execution copies. And here is the grant check for your lab. It's made out to me. I'm sure you can endorse it over, if that's what you want. It's up to you. Dr. Brower. I am Meg Holmes. Dr. Holmes. Yeah. The CEO. I uh, must be important. Very important to us. And thanks so much, so much, for being here. I'm glad we were able to come to an agreement to support your work. Support my work. That's surprising. I didn't know you'd taken much interest in it before. We only learned recently how much good it can do. Dr. Holmes, with respect, may I ask you something? Why ignore my data? You read the report, you, you know what happens. Klaralon doesn't work. Let's say it doesn't work. What then? Then why make it? Because it will work. It will, in time. You're a scientist, you can't sign your name to a lie. It's not a lie. It's a step on the path. I am here operating in the real world, and if Klaralon is even 1% better than oxycodone, then that's 1% that can change the world. You will never change demand or behavior. But you will fund continued research through these products and take a step closer to the ultimate breakthrough that will come. That's not my world. That's a cause. I don't deal in causes. - But somebody has to. - I deal in science. I deal in truth. And what precisely is that truth? You think you get to make that decision, along with all the collateral damage it might bring with it? What about the millions in pain who need this drug to ease their suffering and use it legitimately? Should they be denied care because you say so? You're holding up one animal study, one highly questionable study, while even you yourself know that 65% of these animal studies don't translate to humans. And for that you wanna destroy a chance at real relief? If that's not a cause, I don't know what is. I can't do it. I won't do it. Jake. No Labatt tonight? No. Just whiskey. Takes all kinds. We all set for tomorrow? Of course we are, what we said. Good. So, where's the meet? We still work out a safe place for you. I'll tell you tomorrow, Correc'? And you'll be there? 'Cause I'll be there. And I'm not handing all of my fucking money to somebody I never met before. What, you worry I set you up? Is that it? Or maybe you set me up. It's a crazy business we choose. Crazy. I guess we'll find out tomorrow. Of course I'll be there. You wanna eat something? We make a good steak here. No. I'm going home. I'm going to bed. Tomorrow. Excuse me, miss. Can I help you? No, I'm fine. Thank you. Oh. What? Ms. Reimann, whatever you're looking for, you are not gonna find it in there. What? I suggest that you go home. Go all the way home. How do you know who I am? It doesn't matter. All that matters is that no one wants to see you dead. Go home. Okay. Oh, god. Oh, god. In light of the evidence presented and the university's zero tolerance position on sexual harassment, the chair feels that we have no choice but to recommend that Dr. Brower's tenure be revoked and that his employment at the university be terminated effective immediately. All those in favor? Opposed? The ayes have it. This concludes our proceedings. - What did you just say? - I told him to move closer. Where's Mother? Don't worry about it. You're dealing with us. No. No Mother, no deal. Jake! Where you going? What is this, a joke? Come back here. - Is this everything? - Mm-hmm. - Do you mind? - Mm. Okay. Where's the rest? What, you don't trust me anymore, Mother? This is Montreal, my friend. Strange things happen here. That's $1 million. That's my deposit, like we discussed. Now what's gonna happen is- Hey, hey, hey, hey. I'm reaching for my phone. All right, everybody calm down. Now I text my guys. All right, we move when they come in with the cash. Then they're gonna park two trucks down at the end and your goons are gonna help them load up all these pallets. After that- Tell your man to stand down, right now. I want a better view if we're gonna send our guys in there. You heard that? Check it out. What the hell is going on here, Mother? We wait one minute, okay? No, no more minutes. My guys come in and we do the switch right now! Go, go, go! Go out! Freeze, motherfucker! No! Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. No, no, no. No, no, no. No! Look at me, it's okay! Man down! Man down! Oh, goddamn. Help! Help! The division takes the opioid crisis very seriously. As the president himself has said, there is no greater scourge facing America from within. Well, I still fail to see how a breakthrough drug, like Klaralon, despite the purported implications of Dr. Brower's so-called tests- - Mr. Chairman, respectfully, Dr. Brower's implications are more than purported. According to Dr. Brower's own report, he exceeded the study parameters. And that's precisely why he was able to find the results he did. I think we should hear from Dr. Brower. One moment, please. Okay, are we talking about a shutdown? - What's going on? - I don't know. Thank you, Dr. Brower, that won't be necessary. The division has discussed the matter and is prepared to make a decision. Mr. Chairman, I object to a decision without- - That's enough, Mr. Walker. The division has read the evidence and it is our position that the benefits of the item outweigh these potential risks. FDA approval for Klaralon will proceed. Northlight Pharmaceuticals will arrange a fund for further studies of addiction in the amount of $11 million. Do you all agree? Agreed. Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, at least let me speak! Sorry, Dr. Brower. Meeting is adjourned. What happened? I've been reassigned. So, that's it? It's over? There's gotta be another way. I've been thinking. There's someone you can talk to, but without the committee's protection, you'd have to violate your non-disclosure. And? And if it goes bad for you now, we're talking debts surviving bankruptcy. You'd probably still be paying in the afterlife. Well, I got nothing now, so what difference would it make? Jake. It's your sister. I just wanted to say I'm really sorry for the other day, and I'm feeling much better now. I love you so much. We're still ID-ing the bodies, but from what we can tell, they were low-level muscle. No traffickers. What about Mother? Apparently he's got some family in Algiers, so we put some men on the airports, but we're not gonna see him again. How about the Armenians? Prosecutor says he doesn't have enough to charge them. What? They never set foot in the building, let alone the lot. There's no overt act. We'll issue a Red Notice for Mother, but beyond that my superiors wanna terminate cooperation. Yeah, mine too. So, that's it? You're just gonna quit? Calm down, Jake. Two crown officers are dead. My department won't risk any more loss of life. I'm sorry. Agent Kelly. What? What do you want me to say? What do you want from me? I want you to calm down and be professional. Professional what? Agent or drug dealer? You realize how fucked this is? Yeah, I do. I'm the one who had to call Stan's wife. He was my friend, too. I'm sorry. What do you think we're here to do? To make a difference? So, what are we here to do? Our job. As mandated by the people. So, we're just here to clean up, is that it? I don't accept that. That's not fair, Jake. You're a good agent. We fight the best we can. I'll see you at the airport. Fuck. Hello, Ms. Reimann? This is Jim Douglas, Douglas Investigations. I'm just following up on that individual that we spoke of. You asked me to let you know if I had any new information. Well, I think you might be interested in this. Where's Mother? I will blow your head all over this fucking bar. Where's Mother? I don't know! Last chance. He keeps a seaplane by the Dwyer shipping yard. That's all I know. If I find out you're lying to me- - It's the truth! I swear it! Mother! Hey, hey, hey. - Hey. - What? It's okay, hey, relax. - Relax, relax. - Get away from me! I'm a federal agent. I'm a federal agent. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. Let me see. Fuck. Okay. It just went through your arm. You're gonna be okay. Come on. It's okay. There you go. Stay right here. I'll be right back. Already? The university gave us three days to vacate. - Where to? - I don't know. How long did we work together, Tyrone? A long time. And in that time, didn't I support you, and champion your labs, and find you grant money wherever the hell I could, help keep your whole field of research alive? Yeah, yeah, you did all of that. Whatever I did, I never compromised our university. And I never compromised our students. Geoff, all you did was compromise. You had the facts and you just didn't look at them. You stood there while they made you complicit. I spent a lifetime building that school. That I should take a moment before deciding whether or not to destroy it supporting your half-baked research against a drug monolith. What about the people, the ones that we're supposed to serve, the ones who can't speak for themselves? It's the Detroit Evening News. You gave them the whole story, huh? Even everything that happened between us. I thought we were friends. So did I. You know this isn't gonna make a damn bit of difference to Northlight. They've got their approval. They'll still put their drug out. But the people will know. They'll know. And that's the best I could do. I've been asked to resign. I'm sorry. Me, too. If I could do it all over again. Oh. What difference does it make? Bye, Tyrone. Hopefully it looks like two gangsters killed each other for a million dollars and no one looks any deeper. Didn't you say you were a cop? I was. So are you taking me to prison now? No. Why not? You remind me of someone. Sorry. I'm sorry. I don't understand. So, what am I supposed to do now? I don't know. Thank you. And given the doctor's ongoing press schedule that you may have heard about, if any of you ever get out of your labs long enough to read the paper, we were very lucky to get him. So, I hope you'll all join me in welcoming our new co-chair of biology here at University of Michigan. Dr. Tyrone Brower. Thank you! Thank you, and welcome to my class...
