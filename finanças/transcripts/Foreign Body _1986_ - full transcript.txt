RAM: I want to tell you everything right from the very beginning. You see, I had this job as a night clerk. I worked from 6:00 in the evening until 6:00 in the morning, with only one night off each month. It was a miserable job. But, it put a few rupees between me and the thousands sleeping on the streets. Night after night, I would sit behind my desk, perched on a cane stool, listening to the melodious sounds of the Deedar. [BEDSPRINGS SQUEAKING] Ram Das, come down to earth. Hello, Mr. Nahan. How are you? I was just wondering about that lamp. [RUMBLING] Anyone we know? It is the doctor. Really? I want a room until midnight. I'm sorry, sir, but I will have to charge you from 9:00 to 12:00 for the full three hours. It is the management's new policy. Okay, okay. Just give me a key. Right, sir. That is ten rupees per hour, 30 rupees. The other night, a man came here all by himself. And in the morning, we found him hanging from the ceiling. I had to pay for the room from my own pocket. So management now requests payment in advance, please. Thank you, sir. It is room number six. You just go upstairs and turn to the right. Thank you. -I need a room. -Yes, sir. For how long? For the night. The whole night, sir? Of course, the whole night. Yes. Certainly, sir. That will be 60 rupees, please. Room number 16, sir. It is the nicest room we have. It has got a basin with running water, you see. -Thank you. -My pleasure. Thank you, sir. It is the room at the top. RAM: Now what was it he had, that man, that I didn't? Money, I suppose. I've never had a girl. I didn't even know a girl. And if I did, would I have had the courage to bring her to a place like this? Huh! Never. Others, it seemed, had no such problem. Baboo! Hey, baboo! -Yes, sir? -What kind of place this is? I beg your pardon, sir. There is only one towel and no soap in our room. It's a disgrace. I'm very sorry, sir. I will bring some up just now. -Well, be quick about it! -Yes, sir. Missee baba? I've got your towels, missee baba. Excuse me. [GASPING] What do you want? [SHUDDERING] I was only bringing you a soap and some towels. [STAMMERING] I don't want to hurt you. It's just that... It's just that you are so... What is going on here? Nothing, sir. You don't understand. I just brought you your soap. -Oh, I understand, all right. -[GRUNTING] [HORN BLARING] RAM: Needless to say, I was fired. I had to get another job quickly. I knew it wouldn't be easy. Calcutta was bulging at the seams with unemployed men. I tried the jute mills, I tried the big offices, I tried the tea gardens and the great market, but there were hundreds there before me. I was beginning to despair when fate offered up a tidbit. What kind of a job are you looking for? I don't know, sir. Anything, I suppose. You understand that there are some things I can do as an official, and some things which I cannot. Of course, sir. Naturally. How much money have you got? 26 rupees, sir. -26 rupees? -Yes, sir. It's no good. There's nothing. You've come at a very bad time. Sir, if I get some more money, then can you get me a job? It's possible. Do you know anybody in London? Well, sir, I have a distant relative. He works at London airport. Domestic services. Domestic services? Good. Well, there is a job as a deck hand on the Cathy sailing for London next week, but hundreds are after this one. Why for this job in particular? Because if one has the right kind of papers, Ram Das, one need never come back. How do I get those papers, sir? It can be arranged. How much will it cost, sir? 1,000 rupees. Suffering swamis. Do you realize there are people who would give two arms to go to London? I'm sorry. I'm wasting your time. Sir, sir, sir. Sir, please, can you wait two days? Do you think you can raise the money? Sir, I'm going to try. I'll wait. One wants to help. Thank you, sir. Thank you, sir! RAM: I decided I wanted to see my beloved parents once more, to say nothing of my beloved grandmother, my beloved brother and my beloved ugly sister, all of whom lived in the same mud hut where I'd been raised. There was something else I wanted. I wanted to break into my father's beloved tin savings box. Ram Das, of sound mind and thieving disposition, was on his way. All the way over to England, my imagination ran riot. I was en route to the land of opportunity, to the home of her majesty, The Queen of England, movie stars, and everything glamorous and beautiful. I knew that, within a matter of weeks, Ram Das, no longer a virgin, would be drinking champagne from some lovely girl's slipper. MAN: Playboy, please. -Thank you. -Welcome. Yes, sir? Excuse me, sir. Do you have a newspaper that advertises rooms to let? Got the very thing, yeah. Try this. It's got a list of every room in London, all for seven P. -Thank you. -Cheers, mate. Paper, please. -Yes? -I beg your pardon, sir. You have an advertisement in this paper for a room. You're too late. It's gone. Yeah? What do you want? Good morning, madam. I believe you have a room to rent. You got the wrong house. -Yes. Can I help you? -Good afternoon, sir. I believe you have a room to rent. I'm sorry. No coloreds. WOMAN OVER PA: Would Mr. Racine on an-679 from Los Angeles please come to the airport information desk on the main concourse? I'm sorry, sir, but we don't have a domestic service office, not at the airport. What are you looking for exactly? Mr. I.Q. Patel. Oh, I.Q. You'll find him around the corner, the third door. Thank you, madam. Yes, sir, can I help you? [TOILET FLUSHES] [I.Q. HUMMING] Would they do this at home, I wonder? -Mr. Patel? -Mmm-hmm. Mr. I.Q. Patel? Who wants to know? Hmm? That depends. Maybe. My name is Ram Das. I am a relative of yours. Oh, no, I don't think so. Relative? No, no, no. Your sister Sunita is married to Ramesh, whose uncle is a cousin of mine. I don't know... Excuse me a moment. Good afternoon, sir. Lovely for the time of year. Just back from your holiday? You're looking well. Well, we all need a rest. Oh, presents for the children. Duty-free. Party tonight. "Welcome home, daddy." Allow me, sir. Would you like to step this way? What a lovely jacket, sir. Original Harris Tweed, if I'm not mistaken. I see the dollar is very strong again today, sir. Thank you very much, sir. Oh, don't forget the goodies. Without prejudice, assuming that we are related, I'm not admitting anything, man, but what then? I'm extremely sorry to worry you about this, but I need to rent a room, and I'm having lots of difficulty. What did you say your name was? Das. Ram Das. Come again. Thank you very much. Good-bye. So let her do the talking. She likes to talk. Listen to the landlady with rapt attention. VENDOR: Lovely apples, ten P a pound. Best English apples, ten P a pound. Come along, now, madam. LANDLADY: That notice means what it says, no women. That door's the lavatory. Don't forget to lift the seat. Bathroom's on the second floor. Don't use too much hot water. Water's expensive. You got your own gas meter, ten P in the slot. Electricity's free, but if I catch you leaving lights on, you'll pay extra. -Well? -I'll take it. It's five pound a week. You pay in advance. I've been caught too many times. It's cheap because of the lorries in the courtyard. They start up at 4:00 in the morning. I hope you get up early. Well, it isn't fancy, but it is a room. And you've even got the lavatory next door. She said no women. What are you, some kind of a sex maniac? No, no, certainly not. But all the same, no women. What does one do? What do you do? I do the old bag. Her? [LAUGHING] She's giving me 25% reduction in the rent. Now, then... About this job of yours. With your qualifications, there are three things that you can do. Number one, you can work in the gentlemen's toilets, number two, you can sweep the streets, number three is, London transport. Well, I don't recommend the gentlemen's toilets unless you are a student of human nature. I am writing a book about it, you know. The streets are very, very cold, so I would strongly suggest "ding ding", London transport. Two, three, four. Sorry, sir. Standing room for only five inside. You can try up top. Never mind up top, you little bleeder. I'm gonna stand there. That is against regulations. Sod the regulations. You lay on more buses. Right. Sorry. Full up. [BELL DINGS] RAM: Only those who've tried to control a crowd of hooligans struggling to get aboard a packed London bus in the rush hour, know what it's really like. Many times, creeping into my little room, bruised and battered, I cursed I.Q. for being cozy in his warm airport lavatory, while I shivered to death each day for eight hours. I soon found myself looking back, almost with affection, to Calcutta, and the Deedar. Then, I met Norah Plumb. -Hello, darling. -Hello. Fare, please. Five P, please. You look tired. We've been very busy. When do you finish? We're on the last run now. Then what do you do? I go home. To India? [LAUGHING] Oh, no. I live in Shepherds Bush. [BELL DINGS] [BELL DINGS] -How about you? Where do you live? -Willesden. I go dancing Friday nights down your way at the Hammersmith Palais. Oh, yes, the Palais. What is that supposed to mean? "NP" Not permitted? Now then, none of that. It stands for Norah Plumb. That's me name. -Norah Plumb? -You know what? You ought to come down the Palais one night. It's loads of fun. I expect you have lots of boyfriends. There's always room for one more. See you. I hope so! RAM: I hope so. What a stupid, witless remark! She offered herself to me. She even paused by the used ticket container to give me more time. And what do you think I did? Nothing. -Is she white? -Yes. -How old? -I don't know. About 20, I suppose. That is too old. They're no good when they're that old. You have to get them earlier, around 15. Fifteen. That is an ideal age. [CHUCKLES] I have a curious feeling about you, Ram, and I'm seldom wrong. I used to be a medium, you know. -Medium what? -[CHUCKLES] A medium is a person that makes contact with the dead. We Indians are supposed to be very, very good at it. -And did you? -Did I what? Did you make contact with the dead? Don't be ridiculous. It's not possible. Though, I must admit, I did feel vibration from certain people. If you were so good at it, why did you give it up? I used to giggle all the time. But I can tell you this, Ram. You are going to be a success. I don't know how, or where, or when, but I can see it very clearly. So, you must prepare yourself. How do I do that? For a start, you must acquire some polish. You're not a bad-looking fellow for an Indian, but you lack polish. You must read books, and learn about things. Have you ever read a book? RAM: I've read several... And memorized them. I have a photographic memory, you see. I can picture a whole page in my mind and remember it. Then you've got a head start. You must read everything that you can lay your hands on, starting with these. You must learn how to behave with people. That way, you will be ready when opportunity knocks. -Yeah! Like tonight. -I don't follow. Opportunity knocked tonight, and I did nothing about it. I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about real opportunity, the gateway to fame and riches, not picking up a lump on a bus. She was not a lump on a bus. She was a nice girl on a bus. She was looking for a bit of black for a change. -A bit of black what? -Oh! My boy, oh! Your ignorance is truly overwhelming. Never mind, never mind. Remember what I've said. I feel strongly about you. There are...vibrations. Read the books. Keep your mind off sex. RAM: In two days, I'd read all the books I.Q. gave me. Within a matter of weeks, I'd gone through his entire collection. I began to read up on biology, and found it fascinating. It was easy for me, because I could scan a page in a matter of seconds and remember it word for word. I suppose it was a kind of gift. ♪ RAM: By the time Christmas arrived, I felt from the past. India, and my life there, belonged to a different world. I was beginning to discover my true self. So, one Friday night, I went in search of Norah. ♪ Are you married? Certainly not. No "certainly not" about it. A lot of you Indians are married and don't let on. Always lookin' for a bit on the side, eh? Whoo! Oh! You ain't been dancin' long, have you? I'm sorry. It's the sandals, you see. I don't know why you wear 'em. Do you mind if we stop now? Stop! I'd love a gin and tonic. A jolly good idea! -You still on the buses? -Yes, but not for very long. I'm studying, you see. Two gins and one tonic, please. What you studyin'? A bit of this and a bit of that. Where do you work? Bloody dry cleaners up the road. What? [INAUDIBLE DIALOGUES] Listen, Ram, you better cancel those drinks. I've gotta go. Promised to go home with my friend Shula. I got an idea. Why don't you come over Sunday, if you got nothing better to do? You can come to supper, meet me mum and dad. You really mean that? Of course I mean it. Come about 7:00. They usually go to the social around 8:00, so it shouldn't be too much of an ordeal. We'll be on our own the whole evening. Bye. See you Sunday! Two gins, one tonic. 85P, please, [BELL RINGS] [SNIFFLES] Hello. Listen, Ram, me father's bein' a little bit difficult, but don't worry. I'm sure it will be all right. Come in, come in. Mum and dad are looking for a bungalow, on account of mum's legs bein' bad, and all these stairs. That is very interesting. It's an Indian word, you know, "Bungalow." What do you mean, an Indian word? "Bungalow" is English. Everyone knows that. I mean no disrespect, sir, but "bungalow" is Hindi. The British army brought it back with them to Britain, and other words like it, like "shampoo," and "cot" and "loot,", and "char," and there are others like "jungle" and "veranda" and "buggy." They're all from Hindi. Will you listen to all this cock? Those are English words, see? All of them. "Char" means tea. Cup of char. Haven't you ever heard of that? What the hell are you tryin' to pull? I'm not trying to pull anything, sir. I just thought you might be interested. Interested? You see? We should never have left India. We should've stayed on to civilize these blighters. -Dad! -You shut up. Listen to your father. You might learn something. I mean, look at all they've done. Look at the black hole of Calcutta. I'll bet it was some of your bloody ancestors who bunged our blokes down that hole and left them there to die. It was our country, sir, not yours. And think of what your soldiers did, tying our people to cannons, and hanging them by chains. Best thing for them, black blighters. Come on, em. I've had enough. What about the washing up? She can do it. And he can bloody well help her. What a horrid evening! What a horrid, horrid evening! And I'd really looked forward to it so much! It's all right. Please don't worry. You'll never want to see me again. Oh, yes, I will. Honestly. I think you're... I think you're a marvelous girl. You can't help how your parents behave. Oh, Ram. Don't cry, and we will forget what happened. That's for being so kind and understanding. Have you ever seen a white girl? [CHUCKLES] Of course. Lots of them. I don't mean that. I mean "seen." Well, not really. Now's your chance. Come on. Sit down. Take your jacket off. Aren't you gonna get undressed? You don't look very excited. Stand up. What about your parents? They won't be back for hours. Don't worry. -I'm not gonna bite you... -[GASPING] Much. [BREATHING HEAVILY] Don't rush. Wait. I'm gonna make you nice and ready for me. I want to find out why they call you Ram. [GASPING] Oh, my God, they're back! Oh, great lord, don't let them see me naked! Never mind you. What about me? They'll slaughter me. You were right. She's not there. She hasn't even cleared the table yet. Norah! Oh, God! Norah! Norah! -What? -Where is he? If you mean Ram, he couldn't wait to get out of here after the way you treated him. Come on down here. You haven't done the washing up yet. And don't stand there gawping. [GASPING] [ALARM CLOCK RINGS] [RINGING CONTINUES] You miserable little rat! -Come down! -[GASPING] Get up. Get up, Indian trash, and fight like a man. It's against my religion to use violence. Well, it's not against mine. [GRUNTING] Dad, what have you done? RAM: That brute, Norah's father, saw to it that, once again, I was fired. A couple of weeks later, I heard there was a vacancy for a waiter in an Indian restaurant. I was on my way there when, suddenly, a perfectly ordinary day became completely transformed. [PEOPLE MURMURING] -What happened? -The bus knocked her down. Would somebody please get a doctor? RAM: That's when it happened. I'll never know what came over me, but I suddenly found myself saying... I'm a doctor. Doctor, please come forward. I couldn't avoid her. She just stepped out without looking, Doctor. She slipped. I braked as hard as I could. I didn't touch her. That's all right. Just keep these people back, please. Okay, keep back. RAM: It was absolutely marvelous. There she was, this adorable creature, with me kissing her, and it was all in order, so much in order that, although preoccupied with what I was doing, I could hear the murmurs of the crowd standing around me. It's the kiss of life. What happened? It's all right. You just slipped and had a little accident. But it's all right now. Mr. Conductor, please. Let's pick her up. Doctor, I have a shop here. It's at your disposal. Thank you, madam. Gently down, please. Will she be all right, Doctor? She will be fine. There is nothing you have to worry about. -Good, good. -I thought a little brandy would help. Yes. I meant it for her. Oh, no, no, no. She is in shock, you see. Quite wrong. I'll need her name, Doctor, and yours, too, of course, for the report. Yes, well, I will write it down for you. And you, miss. Could I have your name and address, please? -Yes. Susan Partridge. -Susan Partridge. -120... -120... -Wilton Terrace. -Wilton Terrace. Thanks. Well, if that's everything, doctor, we'll be pushing off. Right. You do that. I will make sure that she gets home safely. Oh, I look a mess! Where were you going when all this happened? [SIGHS] Well, I'd just finished work, and was walking home. I wasn't thinking, I suppose. It's all so silly, really. You must not take this too lightly, though. There may be aftereffects. -You think so? -It is hard to tell. But, perhaps I ought to take another look at you. Or would you prefer to see your own personal physician? Well, no. Um, no. Actually, I don't have a regular doctor. Well, then maybe I will take you home. Thank you. Come in. My goodness, you have a beautiful home! Well, thank you. What kind of work do you do? I'm a model with the Jackson Agency. You've probably heard of it. Of course. Are you all right? Yes, I am. It's just a slight headache, that's all. Now, please, I want you to go straight to bed, -and then I will take a look at you. -Okay. Can I get you something? A cup of tea, perhaps? You know, you really are kind. Do you know what I'd like most? -A nice mug of hot chocolate. -Where is the kitchen? Through the hall on the left. The chocolate's in the cupboard over the cooker. [SIGHS] I have put in some extra sugar. It is for the shock, you see. Thank you. Really, you are the most extraordinary doctor. We doctors are human, too, you know. I thought you weren't allowed to be. I thought you got struck off or something. -Only if we go too far. -[LAUGHING] And how far is too far? Oh, the rules are most firm, most rigid. If you will drink up your chocolate, we will make certain that there are no problems. Listen, extraordinary doctor. I don't even know your name. Ram. Ram Das. Ah. And where does Dr. Das come from? Calcutta. -And now you're working here? -That is right. Where's your practice? I don't have one as yet, but I'm planning to start on the West End. Ah, Harley Street. Of course. What? Yes, yes, of course. Yes, Harley Street. Well, your pulse seems to be all right. Now, if you will just sit on the edge of the bed, -I will take a look at you. -Okay. That's right. [GASPS] That won't be necessary. Oh. I always thought one had to take one's clothes off. Yes, well, sometimes, it is necessary, most necessary, but not in this case. Well, now, if you don't mind, I would like to check your reflexes. Let it hang loose. That is very good. Now I'll try the other leg. Yes. Is there anything I can do to return your kindness? Well, if you ever find me lying on a road, I hope you will do the same for me. -Didn't hurt, did it? -No. Good. Do you by any chance have a torch? A torch? Yes, a torch. Yes, as a matter of fact, I do. Top left-hand drawer over the dressing table. Thank you. -Ah! -No, no, no. I wish to examine your eyes. If you would look straight out at the wall, please. I what I'll do. We've got loads of girls at the agency, and they're all hypochondriacs. If you give me your card, I'll make sure you have enough patients to start you off. -How about that? -Yes, well, I cannot give you a card, because I don't have consulting rooms yet. But as soon as I do, I will let you know because there is nothing like having pretty girls on one's list, yes? Now, let me try the arm. -Does that hurt? -No. Very good. Now the other one... -All right? -Fine. Well, then, I must be off. Try and get a good night's sleep. I will. I'll tell you one thing. You're going to be a big hit in Harley Street. Thank you. Good-bye, extraordinary doctor. You've been given a sign by Ganesh, the God of success. You stumbled upon the road to more cash than most men will get in a lifetime! [LAUGHING] You can't be serious. I have never been more serious in my life. You're going to be a doctor, my boy. But I don't know anything about it. What's that got to do with it? Half the physicians in Harley Street don't know anything about it, either. All of their patients are silly, middle-aged women with more money than sense, craving for a bit of attention. A few soothing words, bottle of tranquilizer, little neck massage and boom, boom, another ten pound in the pot. Come to think of it, perhaps you should concentrate on that line, you know, stiff neck, backache, that sort of thing. I still don't think I could do it. Suppose somebody came to me who was really ill? I'll fix you up with my friend Dr. Stirrup. He's a dried-up old poop, but he knows his medicine. Only one thing, he won't touch syphilis. He's funny about that. If someone come to you who is obviously ill, describe the symptom to Dr. Stirrup, and he will sort out what is to be done. -Do you really think it would work? -I do, I do. As a matter of fact, pass the Worcestershire, sauce, please, with your fantastic memory, you could probably become a real doctor. But alas, we have not got the time. By jove! What a jolly good idea. It's better than a jolly good idea, by jove. It's the best idea I've had in years. How do I start? Well, first, we find you consulting rooms, into which we put rented furniture. Then we'll get you some proper clothes, and we need lots and lots of equipment. How do I pay for all this? Ah-ha. [CHUCKLES] Where did you get all this? I'm not just into lavatories, you know. There are other things. 300, 400, 500. Six hundred pounds... -You're lending it to me? -Business proposition. I want 20% interest payable every six months. But that is very high. You're damn right it's very high! You try to find another moneylender who'll chance his arm on a no-good Indian rascal that wants to set himself up as a phony doctor. Now eat your beans, and have an early night. I've got to go and service the landlady. She must begin to slow down soon. -Good morning. -Good morning. My name is Das, Ram Das. I've come about the consulting room. Yes, Dr. Das, I'm Bradshaw. Please come in. Thank you, sir. It's on the first floor. Please follow me. I guessed you were Indian when you telephoned. I can always tell by the voice. Did you see our advertisement in The Lancetor The Times? The Times. Right. Here we are. Nice, isn't it? Of course, whoever rents it will have to buy the curtains. I'm not about to take them down, and it'll cost a lot of money to get new ones. How much are you asking for them? A 100 pounds. A 100 pounds? They're worth a great deal more. It's beautiful material. Yes, they're very nice. The central heating has just been modernized. This way, Doctor. It keeps the whole place beautifully warm even on the coldest days. You see, all conveniences. Most unusual having your own bathroom in Harley Street. It is just the sort of place I've been looking for. All the other doctors who have been here have been very happy, and at £95 a week, that's inclusive, it's a snip. -I'll need a month in advance, of course. -Yes. Ah, this is Miss Furze, our receptionist. She is included in the rent. Miss Furze, Dr. Das. How do you do, Doctor? How do you do, Miss Furze? You also have partial use of the waiting room on the ground floor. Well, thank you very much. I'll think about it. Don't think too long. Single consulting rooms in Harley Street are rarer than virgins in the kings road. It'll go very fast. -I'll take it. -Splendid. You won't regret it. RAM: The following day, we rented some furniture, and I bought a new suit. As I sat behind my desk for the first time, I felt a glow of happiness. All I had to do was keep my nerve, and find some paying patients. -[KNOCKING AT DOOR] -Come in. Your tea, Doctor. Thank you, Miss Furze. The other doctors are looking forward to meeting you. Oh, really? How many of them are there? There's Mr. Up John, he's ear, nose, and throat, and Dr. Wyatt, he's an osteopath, and Mr. Pike. What does Mr. Pike do? He's a gynecologist. [PHONE RINGS] Shall I? Dr. Das' consulting room. May I say who's calling? One moment, please. It's a Miss Partridge. Ah, yes. Thank you. Well, hello. Hello. I got your note. Congratulations. Thank you very much. I was wondering if I could make an appointment to see you. Of course. Just one moment. Thank you, Miss Furze. Just a minute while I consult my appointment book. How about tomorrow afternoon at 4:00? Yes. Yes, 4:00 fine. All right. I'll see you then. Bye. [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] -Guess what. -What? -She phoned. -Who phoned? My darling, sweet, lovely Susan. And what does she want, your darling, sweet, lovely Susan? She's coming to see me professionally. She doesn't suspect anything? Of course not. She just needs my help, that's all. Well, before you get too drunk, we go to see my darling, lovely, sweet Dr. Stirrup. All right, it'll cost you two quid a visit. That's a lot of money. Try and find it cheaper. If I cannot come to see you, can I telephone? You can send a carrier pigeon, if you wish, but it'll still cost you two quid. What are you into? Neck problem, back problem. Manipulation, that sort of thing. Anything that doesn't show up in the post-mortem. [CHUCKLES] I think I have something for you in the next room. [SWITCH CLICKS] Sorry about the mess. [CHUCKLES] Here she is. What is it? A traction couch. Used to belong to General Eisenhower. He wouldn't go anywhere without it. He had a bad back, you know? This machine does wonders. How much? -£35. -£25. Done. Now, Miss Partridge, how can I help you? Well, first of all, I want to make an appointment for you to go and see my aunt, Lady Ammanford. You do go to people's homes, don't you? Yes, certainly. Absolutely. I think it is most important. I'll look in my book. Right. Um... Yes, how about Thursday at 3:30? Yes, I'm sure that'll be fine. Her address is 97... -97... -Belgrave Square. Belgrave Square. -I'll tell her you're coming. -Splendid. Dr. Das, I've come to see you about something else. I've come to see you because... I feel I can talk to you without embarrassment. I truly hope so, Miss Partridge. The fact is, I've met a man. I like him very much. We've become quite close during the past few weeks. [SCOFFS] I haven't actually been on the pill, and I think perhaps I should be. I wanted your advice. I see. [CLEARS THROAT] Well, Doctor? I suppose you've thought about this carefully, Miss Partridge. Of course. Why? Because I personally am not in favor of the pill. I think it can be extremely dangerous. You can't be serious. Oh, never more so. But all the girls I know are on the pill. -None of them had any trouble. -[CHUCKLES] Yes, and they won't have any trouble, as you put it, until one of them drops dead. It's happening all the time. But I thought the pill had been cleared. I had no idea it was still a risk. Oh! The propaganda being put out by the drug companies is simply disgraceful. [SHUDDERING] We doctors are most concerned about it. This is incredible. I just wish more people were aware of the dangers, that's all. What am I gonna tell Basil? Tell Basil the truth. If he's a real man, he'll understand. [CHUCKLES] Oh! He's a real man, all right. Miss Partridge, you said you've only known him a few weeks. Yes. Well, sometimes, it may be a good idea to wait... Just in case you've chosen the wrong partner. Yes, but, if I decide to go ahead, will you prescribe for me? I'm sorry, Miss Partridge, but I regard you as a friend, and one doesn't willingly put a friend in danger. Thank you, Doctor. Good-bye. Good-bye. Have I depressed you? No. It's all right. Don't forget to go and see my aunt. No. My name is Dr. Ram Das. I have an appointment with Lady Ammanford. Quite right, sir. Follow me, please. Dr. Das, milady. Oh, good afternoon. Thank you, Simons. Good afternoon, madam. So you're Susan's new doctor. That is right. Hmm. She didn't tell me you were... [CHUCKLES] Well... Now, tell me straightaway whether you can help me or not. I get these terrible headaches. I've had them for years. I've tried everything. I haven't got a tumor on the brain, and it isn't my eyes and ears. So what is it? May I sit down? Of course. I'm so sorry! Please do. Thank you, madam. RAM: I remembered a line from Bedside Behavior, "A good doctor asks questions. "He's a detective, searching for clues." To get to the bottom of this, madam. It will help if I ask a few simple questions. Some of them may seem irrelevant, but I assure you, they are not. Go ahead. Well, to begin with, tell me something about your day. Starting when? First thing in the morning. I ride in Hyde Park. -Every day? -Mmm, unless it's pouring with rain. Yes. Yes! Yes, unless it is pouring with rain. -That is most interesting. -[DOGS GROWL] AMMANFORD: You think that may be significant? Well, it could be. What then? Well, I come back to the house, bathe, and have breakfast. Naturally. Yes. Perfect. Then what do you do? I read the papers and attend to correspondence. So you sit hunched over your desk? Well, yes. For how long? That depends. An hour, sometimes more. And then what? I see various people, my lawyer, my stockbroker, friends. Doctor, where is all this leading to? Ah! Yes, well, now, Lady Ammanford, tell me, what do you usually do in the evening? I go out a lot, but if I stay at home, I watch television in bed. Sitting propped up? That's right. And does that give you a headache? Yes, but since I go to sleep soon afterwards, it doesn't bother me. One last question. Is your bed hard or soft? Soft. I love a soft bed. RAM: I was impressed with myself. The questions sounded professional. They came straight out of your patient and you. Lady Ammanford, I think you should try some traction. Traction? How would traction help? It is my belief that the trouble is coming from your neck. No other doctor has ever suggested traction. Possibly not. If they were making money out of you, why should they wish you cured? Now, come along. Dr. Klein, the man I've been attending, is one of the most successful doctors in London. He doesn't need me. That's where you're wrong, dear lady, very wrong. He needs you, and others like you. It is my honest belief that there is nothing wrong with you that traction and a little massage would not put right. Where would I have this traction? -In my consulting room. -Oh! Is there nothing you can do now? -Do you have a headache now? -Mmm. Well, I might be able to afford some temporary relief. Oh, if you could. Well. Please come with me. Now, if you'll just sit down. Now, don't alarm yourself at what I'm going to do. It's just a little oriental manipulation. You have absolutely nothing to fear, right? Mmm-hmm. [GROWLING] Right. [LOUD CRACK] Oh, my God, you've broken me! -[DOG BARKING] -Simons! Dear lady. Don't you "dear lady" me! What kind of a doctor are you? Can I help you, milady? Simons, show this person to the door. This way, please, sir. You haven't heard the last of this, young man, I assure you. Susan must've been out of her mind to recommend you. Absolutely outrageous! I shall report you to the authorities, young man! Look, I think you're making a mountain out of a storm in a teacup. All right, so she is mad at you. But she's hardly the kind to hunt you down just for pulling too hard on her neck. You don't know her. She's just the kind to hunt me down for pulling too hard on her neck. And there's another thing. She's Susan's aunt. This is the end of that. The end of making a fool of yourself over a girl who only wants your assistance because she is afraid. Good riddance to bad rubbish. That's what I say. So what do I do now? Stay at home and wait for them to come and get me, or go to Harley Street and wait for them there? Go to Harley Street as if nothing had happened. Really, if you're going to get your knickers in a twist every time you make a boo-boo with a patient, I don't see much of a future for you in medicine. [SIREN WAILING] -Dr. Das? -[GASPING] My name's Pike. -Dr. Pike, the gynecologist. -Yes. [LAUGHING] Thank God. Why? Do you need one? No, no. I'm sorry. I'm not quite myself this morning. I know those kind of nights. Well now, when are you going to join the rest of us doctors for a drink one evening? -Oh, any time at all. -Good. I'll give you a buzz. I've got a busy morning. Five little darlings. Thank God for the permissive society. -Good morning, Hilda. -Good morning, Mr. Pike. Lady Ammanford's here. -Where? -In your consulting room. My goodness. Miss Furze, I can't see her. You've got to get rid of her. I'll come back later. Dr. Das. Lady Ammanford. Good morning, madam. Dr. Das, come in here. Yes, madam. Shut the door. -Sit down. -Thank you, madam. -I can't believe it. -What, madam? My headache's gone, and it's all due to you. Nothing can excuse what I said to you yesterday, but I didn't know, my dear man, what magic lay in your wonderful hands. Should you refuse to treat me further, after my behavior, you would be quite within your rights. But I beg you not to do this. You are the first person who's ever been able to help. Oh, it's fantastic. I can't get over it. You're still angry with me? No, not at all. Yes, you are. I can see it in your face. You think I'm a rude, and stupid woman, and you're quite right. No, madam. Your reaction was totally understandable. It was hysterical. However, I am in a position to make amends. I understand from my niece that you've only recently set up in practice. Well, I have a large circle of friends, and I shall tell them all about you. Now, when may I see you again? I'm entirely at your disposal. If your headache's cured, madam, of what further service can I be? Oh, you dear, dear man. Your honesty and integrity overwhelm me. You are not only a great doctor, you are a modest and dear person. RAM: Thus began my career in Harley Street. Lady Ammanford kept her promise. And in two months, I had 25 patients, all of them friends of hers, and seven more from the Jackson Agency. By the end of March, I decided to open a bank account. I hadn't made a fortune, but it was better than the buses, by far. During the next four months, my practice continued to grow. I became more and more confident. My patients sensed this. They began recommending me to their friends in ever-increasing numbers. I employed a bookkeeper twice a week and repaid I.Q. £200 plus interest. Before long, I was treating half a dozen people a day. Dr. Das, there's been an urgent call. -Who from? -You'll never guess. -Tell me. -Number ten. -Number ten what? -Downing Street! Number ten Downing Street. Don't you understand? The Prime Minister. -His secretary wants you to call him immediately. -You must be joking. That's exactly how I reacted. I couldn't believe it either. Oh, my God. What am I going to do? Do? You're going to call him right back, of course. Oh, isn't this exciting? Can I listen? -While you telephone? -Yes. Oh, imagine you talking to number ten. -I don't know the number. -It's on the pad. Oh, do hurry up, Doctor. Perhaps we ought to get some flowers and brighten the place up a bit. Oh, Dr. Das, I'm so happy for you. This is really thrilling. Shh! Ten Downing Street. Yes, could I speak to the secretary of the Prime Minister, please? My name is Das. Dr. Ram Das. You fool! You stupid, blundering nincompoop! -You're not pleased? -Pleased? Pleased that you chucked away hundreds of pounds of my money? Pleased that you're about to be flung into jail? Oh, yes, of course I'm pleased. I'm absolutely delighted! Now wait a minute! He's coming to me for treatment, he is not to coming to arrest me. Coming to you for treatment, is he? Don't you realize what you've done? Hmm? You've laid yourself wide open. This isn't one of your silly matrons content with a few kind words. This is the Prime Minister of Great Britain, one of the biggest hypochondriacs of all time! He probably knows ten times as much about medicine as you will ever know! He'll be onto you in a moment! [POUNDING] Shut up! Shut up... Sorry, darling. And before you know it, there will be two large gentlemen with bowler hats escorting you to wherever the boat goes from, and I will be £600 down the drain, up the spout. Perhaps I can bluff my way through. Oh, yes, you've got about as much hope of doing that as winning the Nobel Prize for medicine! All right then what shall I do? You could die tonight. That would be one way out. I think I go somewhere and get totally, completely, and utterly crocked. RAM: If ever I needed Dr. Stirrup, it was now. Thanks. Ah! -Morning, my dear. -Morning. Prime Minister, Doctor. Thank you, my dear. Ah, Doctor. I... I've heard so much about you from Lady Ammanford. She says her headaches have completely gone all due to you. How do you do? How do you do, sir? Well, I've got a back problem, and is it a back problem. Bloody painful. Bloody painful. I bend over one day... [GRUNTING] I bend over one day to pick up an oar, and, bingo, that's it. Thought of having the operation, once when I have learnt to live with it. -You're Indian, right? -Yes, sir. Yeah! Splendid chaps, all of you. Had a couple of your people as servants during the war. Where are you from? -Calcutta, sir. -Ah, yes, Calcutta. The dear old, ah! The dear old Great Eastern Hotel. How is it? -Still there, sir. -Yeah. Splendid place, Calcutta. Ought to clean up the streets. All those people sleeping out. Shouldn't be allowed. There's no place for them, sir. Probably build them some bloody houses. Kill two birds with one stone, don't you see? Give them jobs as builders and provide them with some way to live at the same time. I can't understand what the government's thinking of. I told Mrs. Gandhi that. What are you going to do with me? I'm going to give you a little traction, sir. I don't wish to do anything serious until we get some X-rays. Aa-ha, knew you'd say that. Brought them along with me. They're on your armchair. That was very thoughtful of you, sir. Very thoughtful, indeed. Now, if you would kindly lie down on this couch. Hup. Ooh! -Are you all right? -[GRUNTING] Yes. Where did you get this contraption? [LAUGHING] A doctor friend of mine gave it to me, sir. General Eisenhower had it in his headquarters in France. PRIME MINISTER: Ike, eh? Good chap, Ike. Not much imagination of course, but sound with people. Oh, perfectly true, sir. Now, it is very important that you're completely relaxed. So I want you to lie still for a little while, -and then we'll begin. I shall be back in a moment. -Hmm. Take your time, dear fellow. He's brought them with him. -Brought what with him? -His X-rays. -I'll take a look. -What do I do? -Give him some... -Shh. Give him some traction, then come back. But don't panic. [CLEARS THROAT] Comfortable, sir? Oh, yes, very comfortable. Nearly dropped off. -Lovely. Then we'll begin. -Mmm-hmm. We gently slide your arms through these straps here. -And then, hang on to the bar. Same over here, sir. -Mmm-hmm. There we go. Perfect. -I'm going to stretch you a little now, sir. -[SIGHS] Right. I'm starting now. [GRUNTING] -How's that? -Oh, fine, fine. I'll turn on the motor now, and the couch will move back and forth, and give you a series of tugs that can be most beneficial. -And call out if you're not happy about anything, sir. -Right. Ah... Oh. Everything all right, sir? Mmm-hmm. Tell me if you're not comfortable. Oh, no, I'm very comfortable. Okay, can it go any faster? A little. There are two more notches on the dial. Yeah, turn it up one more, eh? Yes, sir. [GRUNTING MORE RAPIDLY] It's not hurting you, is it, sir? No. No. -Turn it up faster. -It's on number three now, sir. -Faster, man, faster. -Yes, sir. [GRUNTING] Enough! Oh, most... Invigorating. I'm glad you liked it, sir. Now, it's most important that you don't catch cold and you mustn't get up too quickly. I'd like you to lie quite still until I come back. [DOZING] -Yes... -Well? There seems to be a bit of trouble around the 12th thoracic. -You see here? -Is that all? No. There's additional trouble around the first lumbar. What do I do? Remember what I've just said and tell him. He'll be impressed. -12th thoracic, first lumbar. Then what? -Yeah. -Give him some manipulation and send him on his way! -Shh! Oh, you're up, sir. Oh, yes. Mustn't loaf around, you know? Oh! I've taken a look at the X-rays, sir. There seems to be a bit of trouble around the 12th thoracic. Yes, that's what I've been told. And the first lumbar.! -That, too, sir. -[GRUNTING] Well, frankly, Das, I don't give a hoot about the X-rays. It's the back that matters, and that machine of yours is bloody fantastic! Will it last? Oh! It might very well last, sir. But you must be very careful at first and do all the right exercises so you can build up those muscles again. And now, sir, I'd like to give you a little oriental manipulation. I'm afraid we've run out of time, my boy. I've got a cabinet meeting in 30 minutes. I'll just shove on the clothes, borrow your bathroom, and I'll be on my way. The bathroom, sir. Yes. Ahem. Yes, of course. I should just go in and tidy up, sir. He's coming into the bathroom. Good. I'll get to meet him. You'll do no such thing. There's a ledge out here. You can hide. Come on. I'm not going out there. You're mad. Come on. I'm an old man. I can't stand on ledges. You don't go out, I won't pay you the money I owe you. Come on. [GRUNTING] I'll get vertigo and fall. [GROANS] No! No, no, no. [SCREAMING] [CHUCKLES] Everything is in order, sir. Good. I feel wonderful, but I thought I heard somebody arguing. Oh, no, sir. Oh, that, sir. That's Mr. Pike. He's just next door. He has a rather temperamental patient just now. -Very noisy one, too. -Yeah. Well, there's no doubt about it, Dr. Das. You're a young genius. [SIGHS] Thank you, sir. Don't worry. You'll be all right. Don't look down. Just keep still. MAN: Keep perfectly still. [TOILET FLUSHING] Well, here I go. How about your X-rays, sir? Oh, keep them, keep them. Doesn't look as though I shall need them, does it? Got a perfectly ghastly afternoon. Two-hour session with the French. Your limousine's ready, sir. Loathe the blighters. Always breathing garlic in your face. Mind De Daulle never did that. -Or if he did, he was so tall, it went over your head. -[LAUGHING] Well, I may not be the greatest Prime Minister this country's ever had, but I may well turn out to be the longest. [LAUGHING] -I'll keep in touch, my boy. -Thank you, sir. [SIREN WAILING] Oh, my God, Dr. Stirrup. [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] [GRUNTING] [APPLAUSE] Dr. Stirrup, I'm terribly... You bloody wog! Don't you ever ask me to do anything for you again. And send me my money, or I'll sue you! What the hell do you think you're doing? I'm a doctor. Of course you are, sir. Come along with us. Corrupt bloody wogs everywhere! RAM: That was the end of Dr. Stirrup. A few weeks later, I received a very special invitation. [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] -Champagne, sir? -Thank you. Excuse me. Hello. Dr. Das. How lovely of you to come. Many happy returns. Thank you. Thank you very much. Basil, this is Ram Das, my extraordinary doctor. This is my fiance, Basil Thornton. Oh, so you're Dr. Das. Jolly good. -Susan tells me you're a very clever fellow. -Thank you. Next time I have a case of the sniffles, I must look you up. -Please do. -Excuse us, would you? See you later. ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ Happy birthday, Dear Susan ♪ Happy birthday to you [ALL CHEERING] Guess who. Give me a clue. Your newest favorite patient. Miss Masters. -Right. Thank God you've come. -Hello. It's a terribly boring party. I was just about to leave. Let's slip out and go to your place. -My place? -Harley Street. At this time of night? Why not? You only rent it during the day. Come on. Be adventurous. The machine. -The what? -The traction couch. We can't use that. It makes too much noise. -They'd hear us in the street. -Who cares? Now strap me down. Helpless. In the clutches of the mad doctor, the innocent virgin writhed and struggled. -Turn it on. -Just a minute. I'm not ready yet! Turn it on. Yes. Turn it up more. Oh... Is anything the matter, Miss Masters? [GASPING] What did you do that for? [SHUDDERING] I thought you were in pain. Don't be so silly. Turn it on again. Yes. [JO GASPING] Turn it off. [GASPING] That was something. Get me out of these straps. [BREATHING HEAVILY] -You're the best. -[CHUCKLES] I'm dripping wet. Have you got a towel or anything? There's one in the bathroom. I'll go get it. No. Let me. I'll be back. RAM: What a truly sensational girl. A fantasy come to life. Sensuous, erotic, wild. I'd been foolish to waste my time thinking of Susan. Let her go and marry her stupid Basil. See if I care. Jo was the one for me. This bonfire of a girl whose passions were equal to mine. You know what I've been thinking, Doctor? You ought to be on the National Health, because if you were, this place would be knee-deep in groaning girls. Good lord, I've got a photo session early tomorrow morning, so I'd better go home to bed. Good night. RAM: My love life was a complete disaster, but I was too busy with my newfound career to do anything about it. The news that I'd treated the Prime Minister spread quickly, and I became even more popular. I think that's all, Doctor. I'll be next Friday. Thank you, Jean. Well, I must be off as well. It's my evening visit to Lady Ammanford. And don't forget, Doctor, you have a 9: 00 tomorrow morning. -Thank you, Hilda. -Good night. When are we gonna get 'round to doing it, then? Oh, one day next week. Better make it Wednesday. It's me day off. Ram. Ram Das. What on earth are you doing here? I'm, Uh, I work here. So you know each other. We know each other, all right. He's the most successful doctor in the house, aren't you, Ram? He even treats the Prime Minister. Have a chat with him Norah, while I make out the prescription. Did he say doctor? [STUTTERING] Yes. I'm a doctor. And you treat the Prime Minister? Yes. But that's not possible. You're a bus conductor. Not any longer, Norah. Now, why don't you come into my consulting room, and I'll explain. Listen, do me a favor, Norah. They know nothing about my past here. What do you mean, your past? You know, shepherds bush, and the buses. Why not? Nothing wrong with being a bus conductor. [CHUCKLES] I know, but they don't understand that. You see, doctors are a bit snobbish about that sort of thing. So you were studying to be a doctor? Yes, that's right. Why didn't you say so? [LAUGHING] I just didn't think, that's all. When we met, you said you were 23. I know I did. But it takes years to be a doctor. [CHUCKLES] Yes, you're right. I'm really 30. Then why did you say you were 23? I thought you might think 30 was a little too old. Oh, that's ridiculous. Been out with men twice that age. -Is this all yours? -Mmm-hmm. When did you pass your exams? About six months ago. And you came straight to Harley Street? [CHUCKLES] That's right. Can't get over it. It's impossible. A few months ago, you were a bus conductor. Now you're a doctor in Harley Street. Oh, you do massage. [GASPING] Shh. Not so loud, my dear, please. Do you remember the last time we saw each other? How can I forget? You still living at home? Yeah, worse luck. Keep meaning to get a place of me own, but every time I mention it, my father gets violent. Still working at the dry cleaners? Oh! Got a better job now. Rag trade. Around the corner from here on Portland Street. How did you meet Hilary Pike? Got meself knocked up, didn't I? Girl from our firm recommended him. Knocked up? -Pregnant, silly. -Ah! [LAUGHING] That's a bit of a problem, wasn't it? Nah. Be over in a couple of weeks. And Hilly's great fun. We've had a lot of laughs. [INTERCOM BUZZES] Yes, Hilda. I've just had a call from Lady Ammanford. She wants you to get there early. She says she has something important to tell you. I'm just leaving. Lady Ammanford. My, my. You know what, Ram? You and I must have a nice long chat. Is something troubling you? You look distressed. Are you out of sorts? No. It's just that I have a rather, rather difficult case at the moment. You need a drink. We'll have some champagne. [BELL RINGS] You've heard about Susan, I suppose. No. What? She's broken off her engagement. He was quite wrong for her. Always off climbing some wretched mountain or sailing his boat or driving in some rally. I, for one, am not unhappy about it. Damn Simons. Where is the man? [RINGS THE BELL] Now, I have some real news for you. I've made a big decision. I'm going around the world. Lady Ammanford, that is news. The far east. China, perhaps. Tahiti. The Pacific. I've seen them all before, but I want to see them again. -Will you be away long? -Hmm. I'm not sure. Six months, perhaps. Ram, it's been ages. How are you? Well... And why didn't you tell me he was coming? I wanted to surprise you both. I'm just going to see what's happened to Simons. The fool's probably flirting with our new maid. I've just heard about you and Basil. Oh, Basil. Yes, well, we had very little in common. I thought of calling you once or twice, but couldn't think of a good excuse. I wish you had. Someone gave me tickets for the ballet the other night. And I had no one to go with. -Why don't you sit down? -Thank you. Perhaps we could have dinner together one evening. I'd like that. But why don't you come to the flat? -I'll make you something. -That would be wonderful. Mind you, I'm not a good cook or anything like that, so you'll have to take your chance. -I don't care if it's a boiled egg. -[CHUCKLES] It seems Simons was showing Alice the wine cellar. That's why he didn't hear the bell. Aunt Grace, have you asked Ram the big question yet? No. I'm just about to. Doctor, how would you like to come 'round the world with me as my personal physician? [SHUDDERING] Me? How could I? My practice. Take six months off. It'll do you the world of good. If you can't do the whole trip, come for half. Like Susan. -Is Susan going? -I'm flying out to join her in Hong Kong. You could come with her. No. I could never afford it. Oh, I'm so sorry. I should have made that quite clear. You'd be my guest, of course. I think it's a splendid idea. Well, I'd love to come, but I have a little problem that I must deal with first. It's all settled, then. A toast... To good friends. Cheers. Oh, you dear, dear man. You don't know how happy you've made me. Hello, boys. [PHONE RINGING] Dr. Das speaking. Hello, Doctor. Norah? Who else? Are you free for lunch today? I wasn't going to have lunch. Could we meet for a few minutes, then? I suppose so, if it's very important. It's important, all right. Where do you want to meet? I'm going to Gucci's in Bond Street to buy a handbag. They got a new coffee shop. Why don't we meet there at 1:30? Very well. I'll see you then. Bye! Was this the one, madam? Yes, this is the one. I love this one. It's a beautiful bag. It's the only one we've got left in that style. I can't make up my mind between them. I like this one, too, and I love the shape. -What do you think, Ram? Which one shall I have? -They're both nice. I'll leave you for a few moments while you make up your mind. Thank you. [LOW] I don't know where you got such an insane idea, but you're wrong. You're a fake. This one's got a nicer mirror. Norah, you've got to believe me. -And I love the zip. -[ZIPPING] Can't we go somewhere and talk? This won't take very long. Excuse me. It'll be one of these two. Could you tell me the prices, please? This is 90. And the lizard... Oh, I'm sorry, there doesn't seem to be a ticket. -I'll go and find out. -Thank you. Surely you're not gonna pay all that for a handbag. I was hoping you might be able to lend me the money. Are you mad? I don't have that sort of money. Successful doctor on Harley Street can't afford to buy a girl a handbag? Why are you doing this to me? I'm not doing anything to you, Ram. Just asking for help over a little handbag. I'm sorry to keep you waiting, madam, the lizard's 170. -I'll take the lizard. -You've made a good choice. Shall I put it in a box or would you like a carrier? A carrier bag's fine. Do you have an account, or will you be paying cash? How would you like to pay, Rammy? A check. Make it payable to Gucci, and put your name and address on the back, sir. Thank you. A hundred and seventy... Pounds. Your receipt's in the bag, madam. Oh, thank you very much. Thank you, sir. -Excuse me. Good-bye. -Bye-bye. -Bye-bye, sir. -This is blackmail. Don't start talking to me like that, or I might turn nasty. I can think of a few people who'd be interested to find out about a bus conductor who set up practice in Harley Street. -They wouldn't believe you. -Wanna bet? Taxi! As soon as I get rid of my little problem, you and I must have some dinner. You mean, the bag isn't the end of it? Oh, I just thought... Can I have £2 for the taxi? Ta-ta. Portland Street, please. See you soon, Doctor. RAM: It occurred to me that the simplest way out was to kill myself, and then I thought if anyone's going to be killed, it should be Norah. Then I thought I must review the situation calmly and decide on a realistic course of action, but it was I.Q. who came up with the solution. Phone call for you, Norah. Oh, ta. Here you are. Hilly? -RAM: Norah? -Yeah. This is Ram. Ram Das. I was wondering if you would be free for dinner tonight. What's all this? Well, you wanted to have dinner with me. I'm suggesting tonight. I was gonna have an early evening. Hilly's away. I know. He's gone to a conference in Manchester. Well, all right. What time? Why don't you come to Harley Street at about 7:30? Will you be there that late? Yes. I have some work to do. Where would we have dinner? A place around the corner on Devonshire Street. Actually, I was going to ring you. I have to borrow some money. Why don't we discuss that tonight? Oh, there's nothing to discuss. I just need some money. [DOORBELL RINGS] Good evening, Norah. Come in. Didn't have time to go home. Hope I'm dressed right. -Oh! You look fine. Go on up. -Thanks. Certainly fool anyone with this set-up. Can I get you a drink? -Got any gin? -Absolutely. With tonic, right? Yeah, thanks. Fancy you remembering that. I am afraid, there isn't any ice. That's all right. Hilly says you've got more patients than he has. Hmm. I've been lucky. There's something I've been meaning to ask you. You haven't told Hilary or your father anything about me, have you? I'm not daft. [CHUCKLES] You really do look like a doctor. Don't think I'll ever trust one again. Must have taken a lot of nerve. -Not compared with what you're doing. -What do you mean? Blackmail takes a lot of nerve, doesn't it? That's the second time you've used that word. It's not that at all. Just a little arrangement between the two of us. I say nothing, you help me financially. And what makes you think I'm able to do that? You must be making a fortune. Well, I'm not, and a great deal of money is still owed to the syndicate. What syndicate? The one I borrowed the money from. Where do you think I got it? I don't know. Some friend, I suppose. I don't have a friend with that sort of money. This syndicate, do they know what you used the money for? Mmm-hmm. It was their idea. You mean there's this group of people and they said, "We'll put up the money for you to pose as a doctor"? That's right. And they charge a huge interest. Does this syndicate know that I found out about you? I told them. What did they say? You are about to find out. NORAH: What do you mean? Is this some kind of a joke? -Is this her? -This is her. What's this? What's happening? Sit down...pig! I thought we were going to dinner. You said we were... Shut up...pig. -What's that? -What do you think it is, water pistol? I'm three months' pregnant. You shouldn't be frightening me like this. So, you are the blackmailer, huh? I'm no blackmailer. It was a bit of fun. Oh? £170 for a handbag? That's your idea of a bit of fun? So... You are going to have an abortion, right? I can't keep it. I'm not married. Oh, please, spare us the excuses. You should have thought of that before. Your father will be informed about your pregnancy. He will also be informed, sorry, that it was Ram Das here who did the dirty deed. Ram? But he's got nothing to do with it. Knowing of your father's love for the colored races, his reaction should be very interesting, to say the least. He'll kill me. Good. That will solve everybody's problem. Oh, please don't tell my father. -I won't do it again. -Sit down, sit down over here. Now, then, write what I tell you. I, Norah Plumb... Norah Plumb... Am pregnant with the child... With the child... Of Ram Das... [WEEPING] Ram Das... With whom I've been having sexual intercourse. You know how to spell that, all right. I'm also intending to have an abortion -by doctor... -Abortion... -What is his name? -Hilary Pike. Dr. Hilary Pike... Hilary Pike... With whom I've also been having sexual intercourse. [WEEPING] Sexual intercourse. Let me see that. -Aborshun, s-h-u-n. Gee. -[WEEPING] Sign it, ignorant pig. Ignorant... No, no, with your name, with your name. Sheesh. Good. Should you ever attempt again to blackmail my colleague or to communicate with him in any way whatsoever, this will be sent to your father. Should he not, in our opinion, deal harshly enough with you, the syndicate will! The boys will give you a good seeing to. [GASPING] Is that understood? -Understood. -Now get out. You were great. [BOTH LAUGHING] RAM: I.Q.'s success did wonders for me. So I was in great shape when, on Sunday evening, I arrived full of hope and anticipation for that special date. [HUMMING] Hello. Oh, Ram. It's all so awful. -What's the matter? -She's dead. -Who's dead? -Aunt Grace. What? Simons found her in bed this morning. She died in her sleep. My God. [STAMMERING] I can't believe it. I tried to find you everywhere. I was out all day. How did it happen? She seemed so well. When I couldn't find you, I called Dr. Klein. She had heart disease. Heart disease? Apparently she'd had it for years, but she told Dr. Klein she didn't want anybody to know, not even you. I'd like another brandy, please. You're not driving, are you, sir? No. No, I'm not driving. FURZE: Doctor... Doctor... Wake up, Doctor. Please wake up. Have you been here all night? Lady Ammanford died yesterday. I know. Miss Partridge called me, but I didn't know how to contact you. Colonel Partridge just phoned. He wants you to go to Wilton Terrace at once. He says it's most important. Shall I call him back? Thank you, Hilda. Tell him I'll be there in 30 minutes. [PHONE DIALING] [SIGHS] Do I have any appointments? Not until 11:30. Would you like some aspirins? Who put that there? I think perhaps you did, Doctor. -Hello? -Oh, Colonel Partridge? [BELL RINGING] Good morning, sir. I'm terribly sorry, sir, but I believe you wanted to see me. You better come in. Thank you, sir. Hello, Susan. Hello. Better sit down. Thank you, sir. [SIGHS] Are you ill? No, sir. I just have a little headache. I have something very important to say to you, -so you better listen very carefully. -Yes, sir. I'm the executor of my sister's estate. She has left a considerable amount of money. I should estimate about £2 million. To come to the point, a few days ago, she made a new will. The money's to be shared between six parties, myself, Susan, Muff, Cassius, Emily, and you. Me? That's impossible, sir. After death duties, your share should amount to about £250,000. Colonel Partridge, I don't... My daughter and I have discussed this at some length... And have decided not to oppose my sister's bequest. It's most unusual for a patient to leave such a large sum to her doctor, but I intend to honor her wishes. Susan tells me you did much to make her happy during these last months. I did nothing, sir. Well, that's no business of mine. Now, I must be off. Good day to you. Susan, I'll be back for lunch. I knew she was going to leave you something. She said if you were prepared to abandon your practice for six months, just to make sure she was all right, then she wanted to do something in return. She loved you very much, you know. And I love you very much. Aunt Grace thought you might. She really was most discerning. She was the kindest person I ever met. She was a saint. She was a fascinating lady, but a saint she wasn't. She was stubborn, cunning, and manipulative. And she always got what she wanted. RAM: Is this genuine? Of course it's genuine. Phony doctors, that's one thing. Phony passports, that's quite another. I got it from a friend in the high commission. Well, then I'll be able to go on that trip after all. If you still think it's a good idea. Of course it's a good idea. And that's what Susan wants. Susan...you're not going to marry her, are you? I will if she'll have me. You must be completely, totally out of your mind. With the kind of money you've got, you can pull any bird in the country. Why pick on the only one that can ruin everything? I don't want to pull any bird in the country. I want Susan. -Now tell me, how much did this cost? -Nothing. It's a present. Well... I have a present for you. [CHUCKLES] Go on, open it. 50,000... £50,000. "Pay Mr. I.Q. Patel..." You're giving me £50,000? I wanted to share my good fortune with you. [WEEPING] You're not supposed to cry. You're supposed to be pleased. [SNIFFLING] But I don't know what to do with so much money. For a start, buy yourself a clean handkerchief. [SNIFFLING] Have you... Have you thought what you will do when you return to this country? Not really. Everything's happening so fast. There's one thing that you must do. Oh? What's that? You must become a real doctor. Yes, my son, you must follow your destiny and study until you become a real doctor. Now go to your Susan. Leave me alone. [WEEPING] RAM: I.Q. Was right. I must move on. I must become a real doctor. That's it, really. The truth... The whole truth... And nothing but the truth. I felt I had to, well... I wanted to tell you everything before we... If you choose never to talk to me again, I'll understand. I'll pack my bags and go back to India. Well... Ram Das... Come here. We'll deal with the rest of your problems tomorrow. Now turn off that light, take off your dressing gown, and come to bed. ♪
