ALMOST HALF A CENTURY AFTER THE POET ZEKAI ÖZGER WHO HAD NAMED HIMSELF ARKADAŞ [FRIEND] WAS FOUND DEAD AT AGE 25. We went to... We went to Bolu with Zekai. To Bolu... Or rather, I took the bus on a summer's day in the '70s. Zekai said, "There is a tent theatre there." "Come and see what a tent theatre is!" So I went. The tent theatre had a huge effect on me. There was go-go dancing, like the ones in military service. In the tent theatre, a woman was stripping. Her breasts were revealed. But she had panties on. Lots of macho men were shouting "Go! Go!". She took her panties off. But there were more panties underneath. I really liked it. I said to Zekai "What is this?" "We are people, look for a sense of the truth, but the truth is like these 'Go-go's." I mean, you unfold one layer of the truth, only to find another. We had quite a laugh. I remember Zekai alongside the "Go-go's". Because I think his world was similar. I mean something that can be uncovered again and again... to reveal something that is erotic. BY WAY OF A DELAYED INTRODUCTION HELLO MY DEAR I'M ONE WHO SPEAKS LITTLE AND TIRES EASILY I LOVE DRINKING WINE WITH HALVA I HAVE NEVER PRACTISED MY DAILY PRAYERS ALSO ADORE MY MOTHER AND ALLAH MY MOTHER ALSO ADORES ALLAH AS A FAMILY YOU COULD SAY WE ADORE ALLAH AND CATS QUITE A BIT I'll never forget, it was a day of festivities. Everybody was out selling something and making money. Zekai and I saw some chocolate in shiny and yellow wrapping. We bought some to sell. But we realized that we'd already eaten half of them instead of selling. Naturally, we couldn't sell any. I was in touch mostly with Zekai. We used to have a lot of fun together. It was him who took me to a library for the first time. There was a children's library in Bursa. We would go on Saturdays, wait around for hours to find a place so that we could read our books. We had a pretty good childhood... ..until the infection in his foot appeared. He had surgeries one after another. My mom was always with him. That's why there was a strong bond between them. It's hard to live tied perched atop a chair... at a hospital for months to be with your child. When he came home, my mom did everything she could... to make him better getting supplements like fish oil, fruit, etc. First the mother gave birth to the child into suffering Then the child mixed mother and death into pain Then everything and everybody came to being from the child But the day comes to square up with the mother, also The child lives only for the mother, as a child The mother lives not for the child alone, as a mother She shares motherhood at the crotch of the father Contradiction is what grows in the gaze of the child Crying becomes a question with the half share of love As siblings, it was Şükriye, Zekai, Türkan and I who were at home. The house was small, with two rooms side by side. There was a long hallway, not really a sitting room. From there you could go down some stairs to the backyard. It was a tiny-weeny house. But since we spent our childhood there, it has a special place in our hearts. My mother was a housewife. My father was a worker at the Merinos factory. Now I realize that it's really hard to raise seven children. Especially with a worker's salary. My dad had an anvil and a hammer. On weekends, he used to repair the soles of our shoes. Then, he would repair shoes for others in our neighborhood. This would contribute a little to our income. Back then, there were some spoiled and nasty kids in our neighborhood. They used to call him "cripple". Because of this, he was always quite sad but kept quiet about it. Across from your own house Away from your peers tucked in a corner Just as you're wondering why you never join in their games Mostly then it arrives with a chill You enter the room of the clay house facing the street Lie down on the divan on the bristle rug Scrunch up your knees to your chin The chin has a mechanical way of working Your teeth, the gear of a terrible machine tick tock clackety clack rattle crunch Mother comes in you must have caught a cold again she says Your father's aged coat a survivor of many winters past... along with your mother's cloak perhaps covers you The tent of shivers and fever is so set up In the heat of the fire you settle into sleep There was only one thing he cared for; reading, writing poems and literature. We were at the same high school; in fact, we were classmates. We were interested in literature, poetry and other genres of literature. Our high school years were interesting and a lot of fun. We developed a friendship, a love for animals, and a love for reading. Zekai was into poetry. He used to adore pure Turkish. For this reason, he used to search the pure Turkish equivalents of words... from the dictionaries of Turkish Language Association... to use them in his poems and writings. He cared about it a lot. There was a theater in Bursa back then. My sister worked at ticket office of the theater. Zekai frequently used to go there with her. I met Arkadaş there. He was a student at Atatürk High School. Our first connection was through publishing magazines... we worked on separate magazines though. I used to publish a magazine called "Toward Illumination"... when I was a senior student, it wasn't exactly a literary magazine. Arkadaş and his friends used to publish "City 16"... which was a magazine like a newspaper. Our relationship developed in those years in that environment. Then, we graduated from high school the same year... and went to Ankara for university. I started to study at the Ankara Law Faculty. Arkadaş was at the Vocational School of Press in the Political Sciences Faculty. He used to sit at back of the class. He wouldn't socialize much with anybody. I can't say that he was a student with a perfect attendance. He would come and go in a subdued manner. He would always answer if you asked a question. I think that he somehow didn't make an effort... to establish any kind of intimacy. What somehow "forced me" to be friends with Zekai... was his calm and attentive manner. He used to come, sit in a corner and just listen. It took me a few months to realise that he had a limp. He was ashamed of his crippled leg... and had an inferiority complex because of this. Although I tried to help him about it... he was rather obsessive. He seemed timid but also, he was quite inflexible. I'd written "How can anyone be so thin?" under this photograph. It's in the book this picture is in. You can see how skinny he was. Like a stickman. The theater club of the Political Sciences Faculty was staging Peace by Aristophanes. Zekai was acting several parts and also working for the play. The play later won the first prize in the METU Theatre Festival. There were other guys from Bursa who came from the Bursa High School... in the theatre club, beside Zekai. However, they weren't good friends with Zekai. We could feel that there was tension and animosity between them. So, Zekai preferred to choose his friends... from the poetry and literary community. He wanted to read poets and poetry books of all kinds. He aspired to fill his library... with poetry books completely. He used to follow up on emerging poets. In those years, I used to write... for magazines which were average. Arkadaş's poetry on the other hand... was published in Papirüs published by Cemal Süreya... Soyut by Halil İbrahim Bahar... and Forum by Hasan Hüseyin Kormazgil. And there was a newspaper called Ulus... which had a weekly cultural section. His poems used to be published there as well. Another journal that meant a lot for us was Yordam. Hüseyin Cöntürk was the director, editor and owner of Yordam. There were Ahmet İnam, Hüseyin Peker, Tuncer Gönen... I and also Arkadaş Zekai Özger as writers. Once during our meetings in İzmir... when our conversation came to mystical analysis, I asked him... "So, your pen name is Arkadaş. Where does it come from?" "Yes, but" he said, "I use it as my own name." He said "Because one night..." "I saw God in my dream. I was with him." "As a result of this togetherness I became a friend of god." "That's why I use Arkadaş as my name." he said. The novel Mikhail by Panait Istrati, translated as "Arkadaş" into Turkish... speaks of a love like this. I think it was an important book for him. I think, the name was based on a novel by James Baldwin. There are two gay characters in the novel. They call each other "friend". I would say it was probably a reference to that. Don't you get swept up in it It will change one day the course of the wind that worships the sun and the phallus Because I read about it or something that somewhere women were hustled to the gods There was a rough political environment in Turkey starting from 1965. This tension had begun after that social movements became... more political and left-wingers took part in active political life. It was 1968. Student movements had just started. The political scene was beginning to gradually take shape. The organization Revolutionary Youth hadn't yet been founded... but the Federation of Debate Clubs was. ♪ As black winds beat white places ♪ Strap your love around your heart ♪ Take my voice, beat it on the rumbling of your blood ♪ It's time to pierce through the mountains, Ferhat ♪ Take my voice, beat it on the rumbling of your blood ♪ It is time ♪ It's time to pierce through the mountains, Ferhat. ♪ We all cared deeply about revolutionism. We thought... "Unless we go to every protest, we will get a bad reputation." Say, if there was a protest at the US Consulate... Arkadaş Zekai would be there. I mean, I remember that he participated in every protest. But I could say the same thing for everyone. Almost all of us would go to everything. No to fascism! Back then, people were trying to follow suit with everyone else and not stick out. Things like, "We're revolutionists..." "we wear khaki coats, we sing anthems." etc. If we were reborn, people of our era... we would do exactly the same things. We wouldn't be in awe of Americans. We wouldn't see Süleyman Demirel as a magnificent man. Those things would happen again... and we would do the same things all over again. Here we're talking about Hüseyin Cevahir, Mahir Çayan... That's the era you know. We're talking about executions, murders and slaughters. The day starts life with death Every dawn breaks on a new dead body Every morning, newspapers talk of death On the left corner, blessing death a photograph X-raying death on my body of a new murder My brain keen with patience goes through news columns, commentaries, false obituaries Our obituary has long been written Apparent from where and how when it comes Such death bears a noble name Be it a bloodtree dear, or a poppy field Zekai and the other freshmen had just arrived at the faculty... and we were all in the same dormitory In the dormitories, there's a sort of camaraderie you know... everybody has this notion of... "Let's all live together harmoniously" In the dormitory, there were triple rooms... ..also rooms with eight-ten beds. The rule was that... you had to stay in the more crowded rooms as a freshman. If there was space and when you had seniority... it was possible to move to the triple rooms. I think that Arkadaş was in one of the crowded rooms. He was in a small room. And when our conversation went on for too long... we would share the same bed. I remember that Zekai gave me pajamas... ...and I slept in a bed which was two or three over, and I remember Zekai singing when I woke up the next morning. He had a picture which he'd given to me back then. His finger was pointing up. He wrote "Think of me as I am now, would you?" on the back side of that photograph. In fact, almost all university dormitories in Istanbul... had become battlefields. Who was to dominate the dorms? Fascists or revolutionists? The same thing spread to Ankara as well. Right-wingers used to stay at Nigde dorm, which was close to our dorm. Revolutionists attacked it. Then, security forces chased them to our dorm. They surrounded our dorm and the assault began. Hüseyin Cevahir and I tried to stop the raid. We thought the dean could help us. He came along and tried to reason with the police forces. But they couldn't care less. There were police cars waiting at the end of the street... known as Fruko back then. There was a brand of fruit juice called Fruko, Since the police cars resembled the juice boxes, they were called Fruko. There were battles in every room, along each hallway... clashes all over the place, centimeter by centimeter. The police were dragged half conscious, unconscious students... and took them away. I was also there. But the police couldn't take us, four-five girls... as they couldn't find a separate vehicle. They said, "We can't be bothered with you!" and let us go. The distance between the dormitory and the main road... was about 40-50 meters. Cops were lined up on both sides of the street. They were beating students with truncheons and... pushing them into police vehicles. We went to a friend after he'd been released. They had beaten him so hard that... his body was completely covered in bruises. Even his neck, his nape... I don't know how to explain it? He'd been beaten with such hate and contempt. Zekai said... "Man, they beat us to music..." "counting to three for each blow!" We were 300 patriots One day, while watering our flowers 3,000 men of the enemy and their civilian mercenaries attacked our land We were suppressed suddenly We were suppressed bad As the afternoon sun was shining on our hearts and as we cultivated our flowers in its rays Yet we have an oath to three hundred flowers we would not surrender this land the soil that makes them bloom or our bodies that make them grow and thrive Our weapons were flowers Our ammunition was our hearts We were fewer but had no fear How many hours did we fight, How many centuries of hours? Without even caring about how few we were and the multitudes of the enemy 300 patriots against 3,000 bloodthirsty enemies We would fight more many more centuries of hours Ohh heedless night, reckless night when it came with its hideous darkness half of our land was captured by the enemy Half of 300 patriots were captured by the enemy A troop of furious, bloodthirsty, lunatics! While the bloody enemy venting their anger on the captives resisting meant sacrificing them For god's sake we resisted well the enemy For the sake of 300 flowers we resisted well the 3,000-strong enemy I remember very well that his voice was hoarse and shaking, as he read that poem. That incident was something he felt in his bones. Arkadaş was seriously harmed in that raid. In fact, allegedly, those truncheon beats in the raid... was the cause of his death later. It was January 1971. It was the period that lead up to the March 12th military coup. So what had happened in the dorms was just another day, just banter. Because we were constantly beaten in protests back then. The excitement of events that took place in those years... somehow we rendered as humor. Even death, or other things. There was always a humorous side. Because there was also a childish side. It was like we were in a game; I don't know. The poem which I followed up on the most was... the poem he wrote for our mutual friend Hüseyin Cevahir. "Warming your forehead with mountain fires... washing your face with blood, my friend." Hüseyin was murdered. One day I met up with Zekai in Ankara. We went to sit at Zafer Bazaar. "Have a look." he said, "A new poem." But it hadn't been completed yet. He read these verses, which later became well-known, to me. ♪ Warming your forehead with mountain fires ♪ washing your face with blood, my friend ♪ May the crimson rose smiling on your lips as you sleep ♪ be the revolt that harvests my heart ♪ Be the revolt. ♪ Tell me hey the moth rendering death apparent What offspring is valiant on their own? What fire is singly put out? Ah! Everyone keeps silent No one realizes the fire in my heart Ah! Does everyone keep silent? The friend I bonded my heart with Ah! Does everyone keep silent? Friends with hearts like ours pledging themselves like a cross to the world As life's fiery colored butterflies trapped one by one for atrocious collectioners Ah! Does everyone keep silent? He asked, "What do you think?" I said, "Zekai, you're going to win the Nobel Prize!" "You are going to be the first person from Turkey to win the Nobel Prize in poetry." Then, I said... "Howcome Nazım Hikmet never got it?" "He could be awarded it now." etc. He said, "The dead can't win the Nobel." Life is a tragic homosexual I think all homosexuals are a bit like Adonis Because all intoxications are a bit like the sober deliriums of Freud It's time, the sun has exploded! Now, an invasion of bullets has begun over the city! They have run Urartian embroderies of millennia! It was the invasion of deaths and requiems! There was a community of young poets... who used to write revolutionist poems around the faculty. Their poems would be read by students... such as İsmet Özel, Özkan Mert, Ziya Öztan, Ataol Behramoğlu in the canteen. They followed up on each other and... mostly wrote militant poems in the same vein. I curse all individualist poets I'm going to the wholesale market to buy oranges I curse those verbiages those withered hearts the salvation of individual and so on I curse those bookworms Then, I forgive them later In fact Arkadaş's poetry didn't fit in... with the poetics of social realism in that era. Arkadaş used to write more lyrical poems. I'd written a poem entitled "Neighbor of Diaspora, Hello My Dear". I sent this poem to Soyut Magazine. Halil İbrahim Bahar, the editor, said... "I'll publish the poem but the title is too flippant." He said "I won't publish this expression Hello My Dear." This response made Arkadaş Z. Özger furious. He said "Well if you don't want this..." "let me show you what a proper Hello My Dear looks like!" And then he wrote Hello My Dear as a poem... capturing his rage against that editor. Hello my dear I'm one who speaks little and tires easily I love drinking wine with halva I have never practised my daily prayers also adore my mother and Allah my mother also adores Allah As a family you could say we adore Allah and cats quite a bit Someday, without you ever noticing My body, growing towards the sun and virility will fall off your hands and one day eventually you will love Zeki Müren Do love Zeki Müren Considering that era... this poem made a lot of people... including myself say, "What the hell is this?" After being published in the magazine, the poem got... a lot of attention because of the line "You will love Zeki Müren". That reference to Zeki Müren really made an impact... since it involved other evocations. He received lots of criticisms like... "Is this the right time for this?" Arkadaş Zekai Özger had strong convictions about this. Anyone who carefully read his poems might notice that... he had an obsession, meaning he insisted... "I will make a progressive statement about this!". But it was a genuine and innate trait. Nobody pushed him to be like this, indeed no one supported him in this. There was no group who stood by him. He was all alone in these assertions. He clearly stated his stance as... "We need everyone to speak their mind about these things, now! Take your stand!" Someday, without you ever noticing My body, growing towards the sun and virility will fall off your hands And one day eventually you will love Zeki Müren Do love Zeki Müren I think it was a month after his death. Tekin Sönmez asked me to go to Arkadaş Zekai Özger's house... and collect his poems, prose or letters and bring them to him. There weren't plastic bags back then... and I didn't think or plan. They wrapped all the poems, magazines, letters in a tablecloth. There were a lot of letters, they gave me all of them. It must have weighed almost 5-6 or 4-5 kg. We tied it up in a bundle. I brought it to İzmir. Before I sent them to the publisher, I read them all. There were many letters. He had correspondences with some of my friends... such as Cavit Kürnek, Hüseyin Peker... and maybe Halit Özboyacı. I returned their letters to them. When the Military Memorandum happened in 1971... it was the era with the most losses of... books and written documents... for me and my friends. In that era, many of my friends... were imprisoned simply because of their letters. So, we destroyed everything we had. Maybe there are a few letters left, but I don't know where they are. I remember I still have a few letters. Just think about it. If your wife found your love letters written to another man... what would she say and think about you? How could I answer her? Why would I keep those? I mean, these letters were obviously love letters. I had to destroy them. There were so many of them, like this much. But apparently they have archival significance. There were poems and other things, I don't know. What exactly had he put in those correspondences... that would make them love letters really? Which love? I think this is just exaggeration. Maybe he wrote about love... in our correspondences too. But projecting this on to our relationship... or our feelings for each other seems a very forced explanation to me. I wouldn't even say these were love affairs. Casual affairs. Just casual relationships. It wasn't at the level of love. If it was, everything could have turned out differently. In certain parts of those letters... Arkadaş mentioned his sexual orientation. I thought that these shouldn't be out in the open, back then. And I thought "I should return the letters to their owners." "If they so wish, they can use them or keep them or do something with them." Many years later... someone named Suat Çelebi got in touch with me. I didn't know him. He told me he wanted to publish Arkadaş's book. He asked me if I could get in touch with his family to get permission and consent. When we got into publishing with an amateur and militant spirit... we saw lines of Arkadaş's poetry in old magazines. We used to encounter his lines on postcards... sometimes with his name and sometimes anonymously. We found a book published by Nadas Publishing. We began hunting those poems down. I told the publisher that Arkadaş had once said... "One day, if I have my own book, the title will be The Tragedy of a Beardless Boy." When the publisher asked me "How should we entitle the book?" ...I suggested this title to him. But he preferred It Is Love as the title. Our book, It Is Love, is not a book of Arkadaş's poetry. The chapter of his unpublished poems is entitled... From an intimate friend, from his notebook The chapter of letters is entitled Arkadaş letters. The chapter of poems published in his lifetime is entitled... The Tragedy of a Beardless Boy In this way, we tried to create the entire corpus of Arkadaş. We thought "We should collect all in a single book." "So, people could learn everything they wanted to know about him... directly from the book rather than urban legends and hearsay." The Tragedy of a Beardless Boy I lost my beard at a Charles Chaplin war As the boycotting roars of impass shot through my hopes I relinquished my moustache to parroting suspicions I shaved a bit of my beard with candy apples I shaved my beard with postpartum sherbet My cheeks paprika care for some lahmacun? There, don't say your face is your fortune your fall But if so, do not sweat, what doesn't shave you makes you No harvest this fall, blessed moustache Don't do as I do, I'll give you a beard Needle and thread in one hand I'll sew you a moustache My cheeks rockyroad care for some cookies? Dear madam please stop You have a bird in your eye That moustache does not go with the tone of your voice Your beard has grown all the way to your waist Either tie it into a ponytail or a braid Trim your cat's whiskers with a razor blade My cheeks sharpeningstones care for some ethanol? I am a poor and shy customer Do you have any suns I'd like to buy some cacti Pass me a few clouds I'd like my pots to bloom They're cold from the sun, They'll get schizophrenia Please be quick the thorns will fade My cheeks the Gobi desert care for some cold water? Short-lived though they may be Arkadaş had various friendships... often one after the other in different periods of his life... even if he died very young. We never questioned what kind of relationships these were. We don't need to question it. We didn't want his life to be paparazzi material... neither did his family. This is perhaps because I work in law... and came of age in the Revolutionary Movement. You should not make allegations about someone... if they are not around to respond. If he was alive, he could answer these questions. He revealed his sexual orientation through... his behaviour, the way he dressed and his writing... even though he never spoke of it directly. People knew and so... there was what I would call a homophobic reaction towards him. It's hard to say this but... we had heard about his sexual orientation... and this shifted our attitude towards him. We shunned, ostracized and excluded him. I said to my friends, "I slept with him in the same bed" "and nothing happened to me. What's the problem?" ...but they said, "Don't talk to him at all. Forget about it. He's dangerous." Some of his friends even claimed that... he had wanted to have affairs with them... but they rejected him. Because of these rumors he was condemned. People condemned him virulently... and they ended their friendships with him. I think that a sensitive and intelligent person... divides his life into two when he realizes what's going on. People see it as shameful, having a different sexual orientation... and being a revolutionist at the same. It's something like "Goodness, whatever next!" When a homosexual affair occurred in the faculty... it turned into a huge deal. There was a rumor that "two men were busted in the gym!" But nobody went into more detail. It seemed like if somebody spoke about the details, they could also be shunned... or that they could be making it all up and weren't to be trusted. But this was all people spoke about for a fortnight. Because of the reactions to that incident... probably they became more introverted. Arkadaş, Şevket Apalak and I were walking from the dorm to Kurtuluş Park. Suddenly, I noticed that Arkadaş was walking a few steps behind us. When we looked back, we noticed that he was upset. He was weighed down by... all the criticism, the talks of forbidden love. There was already the societal tension and pressure... and now this... It was like an unbearable load for him. As it were, this load slowed down his walk. And people, including me... compromise their own perspectives... and choose to do whatever the group does. You just accept the rules of the group. Nobody pushes you to do this. Nobody forces you. But you realize that if you reveal yourself... you will be excluded from the group. I'm lonely. I keep saying I'm lonely. I keep saying I crucify the night, no one comes out to worship I measure my sorrow, it does not fit my heart How much can everything be, I wonder My nails bleed every time I touch my face The night kneading my loneliness with my sorrow You're so simple inside all poetry I know. I know, this too I know Though there have been as many lines written in poetry as there are stars There is no other self for me but myself Neither a love that bears my shame nor a girl to kiss away my flaws I'm alone only in my own loneliness Mum there's something wrong with me. I shiver all the time I'm cold mum. Make some linden tea for me The stars are uncountable: Longing is remote I long for love, love is remote Oh people! Oh magistrates of my abandonment in the night I kiss your fingers in disgust in disgust I first embrace you all kissing your mouths, your lips, your teeth Little do you know that I'm kissing myself Bed sheets are a sexual intercourse A wet night procreates itself at most A worm adds another coil to its body Pain fertilizes Love-making turns androgynous Oh felons of my nocturnal abandonment Oh faulty prosecutors of my faults My crime: to orphan contempt My defence: to dignify my love I have no beard as you can see but I am no devil I respect my elders and cherish the young I cherish children without hurting them I know how to kiss women and you too I know how to kiss you I met "hü" I must tell you all about it one day One day I must tell you all about "hü" There's a coffeehouse called Çınaraltı in Beyazıt, Istanbul. We used to go there every day when we were students. One day a blonde, short, skinny boy came in. His face was almost anemic. He sat next to me. He was very quiet. He kept his head down. I remember that he didn't look at me so much. We didn't exchange looks, he was staring ahead. If he had looked at me, I would see that his eyes were very beautiful. I noticed later that he had green eyes. I invited him to Büyükada for the next day. We met in the next morning... and we took a ferry to Büyükada. Me and my big mouth! I talked ceaselessly until we arrived in Büyükada. And he kept quiet the whole day. He continued to keep his head down and tried to avert his gaze. I told him about Nietsche's statements in Thus Spoke Zarathustra. I said, "There are three kinds of human." "Herd's people, those who live without enjoyment." "Creative people. And independent people." I tried to explain this idea and... it had an effect on him, this thesis. When we arrived in Büyükada... I was quite out of breath because I was talking so much. Then, we drank wine. We climbed a hill. Not exactly a hill, a slope. We sat and drank the wine. Then, we held each other's hands... and cried together. And he said to me... "I've been looking for you for years." "I've been looking for somebody like you." "I've found my idol." We heard noises coming from the next room. There was a clamor. We were at Haluk Aker's house. Oya, Haluk's wife, shouted "This is impudence! No way!" Zekai was red in the face. We asked "What happened?" Anyway, no one spoke of it that night. When I asked Oya afterwards, she said... "He rummaged through our photo album." "He found a picture of Hüseyin Peker and took it!" Mum I am deserted. I have no other love "hü" grows inside me like a flower of shame My rebellious love my misfit my metaphysical my supernatural my mistake my love my dear delusion, my head magistrate my contempt My contempt, where are you? My heart Surely I shall conquer you one day Arkadaş was obsessive in terms of... his love and interest in Hüseyin. That's why... he was always jealous of him. He loved me. Yes, he did. I don't think at all that... the beloved can ever figure out... why they are loved by others. Why would a person be loved? The beloved can't figure out why somebody loves them. Could you figure it out? You probably have somebody who loves you in your life. Could you figure out why you are loved? Or could you somehow identify love... and say: "It makes total sense for them to love me."? Arkadaş's friend was Hüseyin Peker. Hüseyin Peker was a fellow who got bored with everyone rather quickly. One day, Arkadaş came to İzmir. Probably Hüseyin asked him over and he came. But three days later, Hüseyin left Arkadaş to me... and went away. That's how I met Arkadaş. I thought that he might be interested in Arkadaş. But I wish I hadn't. He became his "bird". And all those letters... Our flaws were what brought us together perhaps. You can say... "He had a crippled leg, that was his flaw." "What about you?" But not all flaws are detected by the eye. And on a night in February On an innocent sea a sea far away from Karaburun a sea where there are no boatmen and no Kemal Abi in the hours where fish and birds die just in those hours he knew Arkadaş Z. Özger And then he knew Arkadaş Z. Özger At the most precipitous start of an end At an end for which all has been laid out He said to him a beautiful limp is better than ugly health Now it is most precipitous for a poem to string together Karaburun and osteomyelitis To pitch a tent to the corner of your mouth to go fishing with a boat named yellow bird Tell me, which poem could handle that as the sea lustfully sucks in the perforated net woven by the sun puffing in and out like a sponge Let's go to our private sea and play swimming There's no point of digging everything out. Certain things should... ...remain unknown. Do I make myself clear? Oh my dear Aristophanes I never forget "peace" and "the wasps" And keep death within like a secret I keep it for god If you ask me... "How can you describe Arkadaş in a single line?" I would say... See, I'm having palpitations now that I'm reading it again. "There, your face is your fortune the season of fall!" Fall... He was a young man in his twenties, but he was like the fall. Our adolescence was extremely suppressed. And this discomfort seeped into our minds, it touched us deeply. We were not able to experience lot of things freely. And maybe because of that, we became "a tragic something or another". Our lives and our youth were a little pessimistic. We lost touch in 1972... when I moved to Istanbul to study philosophy. I used to ask friends, ''How is Zekai?'' to learn what he is up to. They said, "He's drinking too much, we're extremely worried about him." I suddenly encountered Arkadaş. He was really nervous and completely in ruins. We sat down at Piknik Pub. I immediately ordered a round of beer. Then, I started talking but he wasn't listening to me at all. I tried to get him to talk. I kept ordering more beer, he still wasn't listening. Now and then he'd ask a few questions just for the sake of small talk... but wasn't even listening to my answers. This went on for some time. He seemed really shattered. This was the last time I saw him. He had a light gray corduroy suit made. He was wearing it that night. He'd forgotten to take his id with him. Since we didn't have a TV at home... he went to Zafer Bazaar at Sıhhiye to watch the show that he had worked at. It happened on his way back home. When I woke up the next morning, his bed was empty. My dad and I were alone at home... and I told him, "Dad, Zekai hasn't come back." First, we checked police stations... to see if were there any arrests. None. We checked the hospitals. We couldn't find anything. Finally I called my brother-in-law, Ramiz. I learned that he wasn't at Mamak Prison or police stations... via a prosecutor I knew from my military service. So, I asked around, where else to check... and was told that we should start with the Numune Hospital. Once I was there I said, "I want to see everyone in the hospital." "It doesn't matter dead, alive, comatose, in intensive care, "identified, or unidentified." An officer said... "There is an unidentified body in the morgue." I hoped it wasn't him and we went to the morgue. And we saw Arkadaş. We heard of his death but there was a veil of mystery about it. Various stories have been told about Zekai's death. Maybe, the ones who know the truth haven't spoken out. His body was found in the morning. What do you mean "found"? Is it a kitten that's been lost and found? Was there anyone else around? I talked to the medical examiner. He said, "Let me put it this way." "You know how a watermelon molds from the inside..." "his brains were in that state." Zekai used to ask, "Şükran, why do I have these headaches?". I used to ask, "Where does it hurt?" and he used to say... "I don't know. It feels like something is vibrating inside my head." One day I said, "Let's go to a doctor and get you examined!" but he said, "No, no, it'll go away." But unfortunately, it didn't. And it was that headache that caused his death. Some people attribute Zekai's death... to the beating at the dormitory raid. But the raid happened in January 1971. Zekai died in May, 1973. I mean, it's impossible to think that... those truncheon beatings caused a cerebral hemorrhage... two and a half years later. Hüseyin Cöntürk told me that it was a suspicious death. He said, "Arkadaş went to sit with some construction workers." "Then, they threw him into a pit. It's a suspicious death." No, no way! Arkadaş died in 1973. After that, I met up with Hüseyin Cöntürk at least twice. I went to his meetings. I stayed at his place. If this was true, he would tell me what he knew as well. I guess it's become an urban myth. With all due respect... why on earth would he meet with some construction workers at night? I think, he was cruising. He wanted to strike up a "friendship". But we don't know that those workers pushed him over. There is no sign of that. In fact, I still don't know the truth. Did somebody push him? Did he jump? Did he fall because he was drunk? It's very hard to accept even though it's been many years. There was nobody who didn't like him. Really, nobody. He was so sensitive and caring. There were stairs next to the Zafer Bazaar. He used to walk down the stairs, I wouldn't notice him. Suddenly, I'd see his hand on my shoulder... and he would ask where I was going. Naturally, I used to flinch when he did that. And we would sit and have tea, eat something. Even today, I don't want to go to there. I mean... As if... As if I will feel his hand on my shoulder.
