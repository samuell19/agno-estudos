Ha-ha! But you always... you always think that you are right now. Now there you are. That's progress. Now just look at the little devils fight. You know, if they weren't Black, I'd mistake them for Irish. Help me put an end to these festivities, will you? Now get over there where you belong. Wait a minute, what's the idea of all these shenanigans, eh? Haven't we been trained to teach you that it's wrong to fight, now haven't we? We're Deutsch, he's England. What? What did he say? You're a great help. Now I shall explain in correct English. Oh, that would be lovely. If they're still down there playing soldiers. The one borderline, they're German. The other borderline, they're England. Oh, is that so? Well now, here, you get that idea right out of your heads, all of you. You never see us fighting over any borderline. Do you? No, sir, and what's more, you never will because... ...Germany and Great Britain are fine friends. Aren't we,? Now, you see. Now throw away your swords and your pop guns and be like white men. Why, there's millions of us all over the world, but we never fight, do we? No, sir, we don't. Now come on, run along, will ya, before I give you a tanning for the bad boys you are. Come on, on with you, on with you. Go on, take them things out of there. You see? When they're young, we've got to teach them that scrapping is wrong. There's too many Blacks here in Africa. There's too few of us whites to ever be able to hold 'em in line. Once they get the fighting idea into their heads, and never forget that. I'm going to find out what that means, and if it means what I think it means, I'm gonna take that glass eye of yours and I'm gonna hide it on you. You know, I can't get used to these Doing their own goose step. Yes, it is amusing. Splendid. Splendid, Major von Shultz. They're a fine body of soldiers. Good fighters, too, Colonel Cromwell. Well, I sincerely hope we'll never need them for that purpose. I hope so too. Ah. What do you say now to a nice, cool drink of beer over at the canteen? - Thanks. - Jack, that sounds grand to me. You know, you make me look forward to these visits. I have a wonderful time here. Look. Please. Please. Baby. Baby, no food. Your baby. My baby. Oh! This dog, Bolte, consistently bites on the very thing we try to teach our natives, respect for the white man. Yes, I know, I know. Don't... don't let it upset you. Ah, what do we have here? The British lion, eh, old chap? I... I suppose you saw what just happened, eh? We did. All this begging money. I only pushed her a little. I had to to make her let go. And my Blacks were starting, and I was afraid she might have fallen and hurt that baby, you know. Your concern for that baby was quite apparent. Hey, boys, let's have that Susanna song, huh? "O Susanna"! O, Susanna O, Susanna I suppose you and your ladies are coming over to our annual regimental dance tomorrow night? You can depend on the ladies, Colonel. - Oh, you can count on us. - We'll be there. - Thank you. - We'll all be there. You know, Colonel, you are quite popular with my men and, uh, with the ladies too. Ah, you... you flatter me. Colonel Cromwell, I hear you're going to give a party tomorrow night at the post. I am. And those that I have the honor to call my friends have received invitations. - Why, Doctor. - Why, hello. - How are you? - How are you? I'm glad to see you. I'm glad to see you. You're looking splendid. Hello, boys. How's things? Beer. Nein. Give me a bottle of champagne. The best is not too good for August Bolte. Boys, try this one. Do you remember? We're the soldiers of the Queen, my lads, who've been, my lads, who've been, my lads. In the fight for Britain's glory, lads, when we have to show them what we mean. And when we say we've always won, and when they ask us how it's done, we'll proudly point to every one... We're the British soldiers of the Queen Ah, that's for sure, you need the disinfectant. Come on, boys, more beer. Spielbuch! You Black pig! Carve a little bit off the top for me, for me. Just a little bit off the top for me, for me. Saw me off a yard or two and I'll tell you when to stop. All I want is a little bit off the top. Get me a drink. Right you are, governor. Right you are. Damn that Shultz. Shut up! Get out! Ha. Ha-ha... I'm not good enough for them tin soldiers, eh? Me, August Bolte, with more land and money than any man in East Africa. Why, the... Ha. I could buy and sell the whole army. Did you hear me? Y... yes, sir, I heard you, sir. I could buy and sell every one of them. Y... yes, sir. I... I guess you're right, sir. You could buy anything with... ...with your money, sir. What's that? I said, there isn't a thing in the world you couldn't buy with all your money, sir. Ah, well. Well? What do you think of her? Blimey, sir! Why, she's a real aristocrat. She's got quality. Ah, wouldn't those stiff-backed soldiers with their stuck-up, smart women bow and scrape to her, a noblewoman? Well, wouldn't they? I certainly would, sir. Yes, governor. Yeah. I'll make them bend their backs. To me, too. Take a cablegram at once. Yes, sir. In answer to your letter, I am leaving for Germany at once. Here she comes. Oh, Helen, you are exquisite. - Thank you. - A vision in that gown. Oh, you look beautiful. I can't wait to meet the lucky bridegroom. Think of it,. Oh, you're such a lucky girl. It's beautiful. And how are all the beautiful ladies? You should not be here. Ah, fine. My bride. Wonderful. Girls, my fiancé, Herr Bolte. - Glad to know you all. - This is indeed a surprise. Yeah, I thought so. Well, I want you all to come to my place in Africa. - Oh, what a time you'll have! - Really? Why, sure, I'm a king there. I got my plantation as big as Berlin. Quite large, I'm sure. Sure, I got 2,000 Blacks working for me. Some payroll, eh? And Frau Bolte, as my wife, you will be queen of Neu Posen. All right, boys, put it there, will you? Wait. - Keep the change. - Thank you. Pretty nice, eh? Well, when you got the money, you can buy the best. Come. We rest a little, eh? Mein frau. Frau August Bolte. Please, if you don't mind, I'll go on deck and get a little fresh air. Sure. I'll come too. I'll put on the other shoes, huh? There's a wonderful calm tonight. Yes. Too calm for me. Permit me, delicate fräulein. Thank you. Oh, not at all. I have been hoping for an opportunity to speak to you, but you seem so... abstracted. I do not know you. No. No, that is very true. Indeed, my... my action might seem rather forward if it were not for the fact that we are related. - Related? - Well, yes, you see, according to the steamship company advertisement, we are all one big family. Will you therefore please allow me to present myself? Major von Reiden, returning to Africa to take over my command at Neu Posen. Your destination, may I ask? Neu Posen. So... What a happy coincidence. I throw a kiss to fate. Is this your first visit to the Dark Continent? Yes, it is. Oh, I'm sure you will like it. It has glamour, romance, a mysterious intrigue. You paint it so differently from the picture I see. Oh, now, you mean that, as a soldier, I'm a good painter. Of course, Neu Posen, like all places, has its disadvantages also. One of our chief troubles there is a large, fat pig. A two-legged pig. Unfortunately, he's on this boat returning now, and I'm afraid he's coming over to speak to me. Well, well, well. This is a great pleasure. Major von Reiden, my husband. So you're going to Neu Posen too, eh? We're old friends, you know. Good night, my dear frau. Good night. Nice fellow. Come. No, no, please. Oh, a little timid, eh? No, thank you. Well, here is to the bride. And to the groom too. Ah! That's good wine. Well... Oh, of course. Too much light. No! Why not? You're my wife, aren't you? - Well? - Yes, yes, I know. Oh... Maybe you think I'm not good enough for you. I paid the money, didn't I? Well? Yes. And you're going with me to Neu Posen? Maybe I'll never reach Neu Posen. Oh, so that's your idea, eh? Well, easy. Here. Keep me locked out. When I reach Neu Posen, I'll put a big bar on your door. But when I want you, all the locks in the world won't keep me out. Garrison Neu Posen in place. Very well. - All right. - Return to the barracks. Company, enter! My soldier friends. That's a friend of yours over there. He came especially to greet you. Why, Cromwell, my old friend! - Cromwell, I am glad to see you. - Glad to see you. Mackenzie! Hello, Mac, how are you? I'm fine, sir. Top of the morning to you, sir. Thank you, Mac. Oh, you remembered my little weakness, eh? - What do you call them again? - Piccadilly. - Yes, a Piccadilly. - Piccadilly. When I heard you were coming back, I tripled my order. Oh, there's Bolte, and with a beautiful woman. Ain't she charming? There you are, Beauty and the Beast. Now that shows you what you can do with money. Come, my dear. I heard that he went home to get married. Is it possible that she's the bride? Ah, day, governor. Welcome home, sir. Just one of my servants. Bring the grapes, boy. Who is she? A lady. Come. Come, boys, let's go. Oh, uh, Major von Reiden. Gentlemen, I'm giving a reception in honor of Frau Bolte Friday night. I'm sure you'll like to honor the bride and welcome her to Neu Posen. We are honored greatly. And accept our invitation. I thought so. You see? That's what they think of me. Yes, dear, I see. - You, where have you been? - Over here, sir. Come on, help me. Yes, sir. Ah, these shoes. These clothes. Well, I guess it's worth. I've forgotten to tell you, governor, the orchestra has come. Yeah? They've come a thousand kilometers. It cost me plenty. But I waited a long time for tonight. Listen, go down and see if the roasts are cooking and if the champagne is on ice. I want everything to the queen's taste. Meine Liebe. Yes? I want to speak with you. Well, that's nice. But I want you to put on that gray one with the low back, you know, and the long train, so when those stiff-backed officers see you, they die of envy. Very well. I see you use the lock I fixed for you in the daytime as well as in the night. - Yes, I do. - That's good. I might remember sometime that you're my wife and, uh... well, you understand. Yes. I think we understand each other perfectly. That's right, sure. That's why you better use the lock and keep it locked, nein? And where does madam wish the flowers, please? It doesn't matter. Get a move on here, will ya? Put it over here. Put it over there, that's the idea. Say you, put that tablecloth on there right, you understand? Yeah, we are gonna have company fit for the king, absolutely. - Joe? - Yes, sir? After the party, when all my fine friends have gone, I want you and all the other servants to leave the house. You understand me? Yes, sir. Frau Bolte and I want to be left alone. Yes, sir. Oh, governor, sir, poor Hassim's daughter has been here every day, sir. She wants to see you, sir, and I can't drive her away, sir. I've told you I didn't want to see that woman in the house anymore! Bwana! Bwana! Baby. Baby's sick. Please, no food. Out! I told you to get out of here! Get me a drink. Yes, sir. Get me a drink! Listen, I want you all to have the best time you ever had in your life. Sit down. Come on, come on now, get in line, hurry. And listen, hold your tray like that, okay? If one of you drops it, I'll bash ya, and believe me, you'll never live to pick up another. Right you are, governor. Right you are. Just wait till you see what's coming. Very good, eh. Now, fill up the plates, you make a nice serving. Yes, governor. I can't understand why we're here. Simply to honor his wife, my dear. After all, she's a noblewoman. Eat and drink! Don't be afraid! I got plenty of it. And the best champagne this side the Rhine. Serve the people, make it snappy, will you? Having a good time, eh? Yes, thank you. I know you Britishers like scotch. You're rather observing, Mr. Bolte. I got plenty of roast beef too. The best I can find. So, don't be afraid. Thank you, sir. Don't mention it. Bolte? Ah, Doctor! I want to speak to you. Well, well, Dr. Webber. - Come on, have some wine. - Don't touch me, Bolte. Hassim's daughter, she is dead! Well, that's too bad. But why talk of such gloomy things at a party? Come on, Doctor, your friends are here. I warned you before. There is a limit that can be reached, even by such dreck like you. Now you have reached it. Come, my dear. We are leaving at once. Please, please, please. May I suggest that, perhaps, the most considerate thing we could do would be to take our leave. You're quite right, old chap. I quite agree. A lovely time we've had. Good night. - Good night. - Good night. Mrs. Bolte, I'm sorry, but we must be going. Thank you. Goodbye. Come over and see us sometime, will you? So they've gone, eh? Stupid swine. Listen, don't forget what I told you before. You and all the other servants leave the house. I want to be alone with her. I understand, governor. I'll show 'em. I'll show everybody, her too, who's master here. Helen? Helen? Where is she? Gone to our room, I suppose, huh? I don't know, sir. I can't say, sir. Well, go and find out. Yes, governor. I cannot leave you like this. I will not. - Oh, what? - No, no, no. It is the natives. They are beginning their moon dance. There, won't you let me take you to see them? They are just close by. Perhaps it will help you to forget. Oh, forgive me, I should not have said that. I want to forget. We are very fortunate to be able to see this. It is the most sacred of their dances. No. I can't find her anywhere, sir! Did you see von Reiden hanging around? Yes, governor. I always get what I want, don't I? Yes, governor. That you do, governor. She'll be back. She better. And when she comes... Helen, there is something I must tell you. After tonight, I feel I have to... Please, don't tell me now. So you're the one who was too good for me, eh? Now listen to me. You're my wife. You understand? Mine. And what's mine I don't let anyone else use. Wait a minute. You got a lesson to learn. Whatever belongs to me carries my mark. I'll show you. Swine! Major von Reiden. Major von Reiden, pardon, sir, we have a message with the instructions to deliver it to you without delay. Excuse me. Beg your pardon. I'm sorry. I must leave. Oh. But before I go, allow me to present you with this little... souvenir. At the slightest pressure of the finger, it fires. Company front! Attack battalion in place. Ready to march. Your god is Allah, but do not forget, our father is the emperor. England has declared war on Germany and her allies. The third and fourth field battalion will be ready to march together with the first battalion of artillery and the first machine gun company within an hour to the border. Let us not forget that our friends of yesterday are now the enemies of our fatherland. The friends of yesterday become the enemies of today. England expects that every one of her subjects will do their duty with loyalty, obedience, and courage. King's African Rifles, mounted infantry, and machine gun section will prepare to move at once. Carry on. Command, frontward face! Herr Bolte. Herr Bolte. Herr Bolte. - Karl. - Helen! Helen, we are leaving at once for the border. I know. I've heard. Oh, Karl. My dear. Please, you will be careful? Oh, keep out of danger. I will be all right. Everything will be all right. Everything. Auf wiedersehen. Lasser. Josep! Sait! Hey, you black dogs, where are you? Jambo, bwana. Jambo, bwana. Hitch up my carriage, the fastest team they got. And get it out in front, quick. Pack my bags, quick, and put them out in the carriage. Yes, sir. Crying again? For your tin soldier. Well, you'll never see him again. Come on, we are going to get out of here. What do you mean? - Where are you going? - We're leaving. I'm sick and tired of this play marriage anyway. - Come on. - What are you talking about? Let go of me! A letter for you, Bolte. Strikes me as how you might have to go to war, governor. So they got ya, huh? I'm not going. They can't make me go! Oh, they can't, eh? That's one thing your money can't buy, governor. Governor? Plllt! Wait a minute! I've been waiting to tell you this for a long time! You're nothing but a dirty, lowdown, bloody spy! What?! Auf wiedersehen! All right, put them on the carriage. Come on, we can still make it across the border. I'm not going with you, let go of me! You're the lowest thing that ever lived. You contemptable coward. Coward, eh? Well, I'll remember you for that. Stop it, let go of me! I'm not going, I tell you! Stop it! I'm not going with you! Get in! Quick, across the border. Mush, now! Greetings, Bolte. Sorry to detain you. Major von Reiden wants to have you fitted for a uniform. Uniform? White soldiers leave. , did you bring your supplies down here? The British hold that point. My boy, it makes very little difference whether the British are at this point or whether they're over here. We will get all our supplies through just the same. - "...In great danger." - It has... "Send help at once." "Natives in rebellion, burning fronds." Are you all right? , you must get a detachment through to them. But we can't spare a detachment. But good God, man, you... Our forces are outnumbered. Besides, the trails swarm with the British. Then I go alone with your permission. - Help me. - Hold on. I can get through the jungle. But good God, the jungles are alive with the savages. All right, come on. Good luck. Auf wiedersehen. Stop! You go over there... A white soldier coming through the jungle. - And the troops? - No, he's alone. Open the gates. , close the gates. Did you get our message? Helen! Helen. My dear! Oh, you are hurt, Karl. You are hurt. Have some water. Don't fire till you get the word of command. The Maasai are coming from the river. They've joined with the Kanuris. God, there are thousands of them! Don't cry. Don't cry. Nothing's gonna hurt ya. Fall back, fall back, company! Karl, the troops are here. We are saved! Troops, yes. But they're British. ...Prime Minister. And it's a long while since we've smoked a Piccadilly together. Yes. Allow me. Cromwell. My respects, ma'am. I feel I could not leave my prisoner in better hands.
