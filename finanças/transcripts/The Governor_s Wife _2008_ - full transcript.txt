What happened? They're down there. They're down... Ann, we're gonna take good care of you. Get some rest. Nathan, she's in the best hands possible. We're gonna get you on the road, all right. You're gonna be all right. Hi. How wasyour mother's birthday? My stepfather was murdered last night. What? Yeah. Um... My mother was wounded. We're here at the hospital now. My god....How is she? I guess she's okay. The bullet just grazed her neck. Do you think you could come up? Yeah, yeah, of course. Thanks, honey. Whoa, whoa, hold on. No one's allowed in, miss. They're expecting me. I'm a friend of Nate's... Dr. Heather McManus. You look too young to be a doctor. You want me to call? No, no. No, I'll do it. Hold on. Hello? She's my fiancée, Carl. Let her through. Sending her through now. Thanks. This is so awful. Do the police know who did it yet? No. We haven't even had a chance to talk to them yet. Just... dealing with my mother has been... Were you in the housewhen it happened? Well... I fell asleep after the party on the veranda. Right. And the gunshots woke me, so I ran inside the house, and I found her there, and she was... She was running out of the bedroom covered in blood. Did shesee who did it? No. They were both asleep. Whoever it was aimed for their heads. I mean, he wanted them both very dead. I am so sorry your visit to our home is under such difficult circumstances. I'm here to helpin whatever way I can. I can't believe Tyler is gone. First James and now him. Thank you, Vera. You know I like ice. Actually, Ann, room temperature is better. Your body can'tabsorb cold water as quickly, so the pillstake longer to dissolve. I'd forgotten. You're a doctor. Heather's in charge of the emergency room at mercy hope. Vera, I've changed my mind. No ice. Doctor's orders. So, you... Told her about the engagement. Yeah. You okay with that? What if I said I wasn't? This guy... He used to be head of security for my father when he was governor, but now he's the county sheriff. Hey, Carl. How's she doing? She wants to know when she can get back in the house. For Christ's sake, it's still a crime scene. Look, my guys are still working. I know. You talk to her. She won't listen to me. This is a beautiful home. Yes. It is. Can't this wait till tomorrow, after we geta cleaning crew up there, Ann? Do you think a good wash and scrub can erase what happened? It's indelible. Excuse me, ma'am. Dr. Burke's on the phone. Thank you, Vera. Tell him I'll be right there. Yes, ma'am. Haley ran away again. From the hospital, late last night. Thankfully, she's back at the clinic now. Does she know about her father yet? I thought it's bestif the staff informs her. I know from experience people handle these things better when they hear it from a family member. My stepdaughterdoesn't like me very much, I'm sorry to say. I mean, I've tried to help her, but... she's strong-willed, like her father. He, of course, adored her, ignoring all the warning signs... The anorexia, the depression... The suicide attempts. You should tell her, Nate. I wouldn't dream ofplacing that burden on Nathan. Look, it's okay. I'll go. I don't mind. We'll both go. Okay. Come on! You can go faster! No, I can't go faster. You come down right now. Stop, it's my life. Jerry, slow down! This isa beautiful facility, Dr. Burke. Thank you. What I'm most proud of is our open-door policy. We never turn anyone awayfrom lack of insurance or funds. That's wonderful. It wouldn't be possible without the generosity of the danville family, especially Nate's mother. She's very involved, very passionate about our mission. Maybe green. Do you want to do green now? Haley? How about you try green? Do you want to do green now? Why don't you try green? That's better than yesterday. That's good. Have a nice visit. Thank you. I hardly even recognize her. Look, Haley. You have a visitor. Here. Come on. Haley? I'll be right over there. Sure. Hey. It's your long-lost stepbrother Nate. Haley? Hi. I'm Heather. I'm a friend of Nate's. We need to talk to you, Haley... About your father. Something's happened. What happened? I'm Carl lovett, sheriff of this county, but most of you probably already know that. The investigation into the murder of Duke black and the attempted murder of his wife, Ms. Ann danville, is still ongoing, so I'm not at Liberty to discuss any more than I've already told you. Now, I hope you all understand that. We have lost a great man, a friend to this community, and, I might add, a good friend to me. I called this press conference only at the insistence of Mrs. Danville, who wishes to make a brief statement. Ann? Look this way, please. Thank you, sheriff lovett. You are a good friend of ours, as well. And I'd liketo say to all of you here and to everyone who will see this, please help the police. Find whomever committed this grievous act against my family. And to that end, the danville family is offering a reward of $100,000 for anyone with information that will lead to the apprehension of thosewho murdered my husband. Thank you. Sheriff! Sheriff! Please. No. No questions. Your poor mom. I'm gonna go check on her, okay? How are you feeling? Forget about me. How's Haley? Out of it. She wasn't... Coherent in any way? I doubt she even knew who I was. So sad. Heather thinks she's overmedicated. She's medicated for her own safety. We can't have herhurting herself again. Right. How long have you been working here? My husband and me startedwith the governor's first term. Going on 20 years now. Mrs. Danville thought you'd be comfortable here, dr. McManus. Please... Heather. What are you doing, Keith? Light socket was broken. I fixed it. Where are Nate's things? I moved them into his old room at the far end of the hall. Vera... We live together. But you're not married. Mrs. Danville has very strict opinions. I'm just following her rules. Thank you. It's so beautiful here. I don't even mind staying in the guesthouse for a few days. Darling, do you remember Joe karth? Yeah. He wasthe party state chairman, right? And one of your father's best friends. Well, apparently, the party wants to endorse you as their candidate for Attorney General. We have two years to mount a successful campaign, and then in four years... Governor. You're kidding, aren't you? No. They are quite serious. Nathan, this is exactly what your father would have wanted, what he would have expected. Well, tell himthat I'm very flattered, but I'm not running for anything. Why not? It's in your blood. This is our future... together. It might be yourfuture, but it's not mine. Don't you understand? I'm perfectly happybeing a public defender. Just think about it. Talk to Heather. I'm sure she'll help you change your mind. The investigation into the murder of Duke black and the attempted murder of his wife, Ms. Ann danville, is still ongoing, so I am not at Liberty to discuss any more than I've already told you. I mean, I hope you all understand that. Vera... Why didn't you tell me Haley ran away from the hospital last night? I didn't know. Billy onlyfound her this morning. I was already up herewith you. He took her right backwithout telling me. I want to know everything that goes on in this house. You know that. Yes, ma'am. Tell your husband I'm very disappointed in him. It won't happen again. Make sure it doesn't. We're ready for dessert. You can bring it now. I am a lucky woman. No more pills. Well, if you change your mind, they're here. Okay. See you in the morning. Okay, darling. Wait. I wanted you to have this. It's the ring your father gave me. I've been saving it for you. For your bride. This means a lot to me. Thank you. No one will ever love you like I do. So, I guess that makes it official? Nathan. So, you're a nurseat the danville mental hospital. I promise, whatever you say will be off the record. You swear? 'Cause I've got a big mouthwhen I've been drinking. I've probablyalready said too much. I'd never reveal a source, Barb. When was Haley first admitted? About six months ago. Do you know if her father agreed to her commitment? I'm not real sure. But I did overhearher stepmom talking to Dr. Burke that she really had to convincehim to go along with it. What was her condition when she first arrived? She seemed okay. I mean, she didhave some abuse problems. But thenthey started keeping her doped, as opposed to detoxing her. Yeah, but why keep her doped? I don't know. Wow. Look at all this. I know your support means the world to her, and I'll convey your sympathies, senator. Thank you. Thank you. My, look at you. The prodigal son returns. Hi. So sorry about Duke. Such a loss. What are you doing here? Your mother called last night and asked meto help with the arrangements. So, you must be a new fiancée. Mandy Paulson... The old fiancée. Actually, we were never engaged. Not formally. He's right. I never should have left for New York. Out of sight, out of mind. It's been like this all morning. We'll catch up later, okay? Mandy Paulson. That shouldn't be a problem. Well done, David. This will do nicely. May I speak to you privately? Um, why don't you go up to the house and introduce yourself to Nathan's fiancée? Thank you. Why is Mandy here? She's an event planner... And a very successful one. I called herbecause I needed her and, quite frankly, wanted her company. How much longer is she staying? For as long as I need her. We can have a relationshipseparate from you. Fine. But I'm leaving as soon as this event is over. The family's just arrived. Any words, Mrs. Danville? We'd love tohave some words from you. Here we go. Good. All right. When this is over, you keep themaway from the family. All right, folks, the service is about to start. There. Mandy... Can you see what you can do about this? There you go, Haley. There. There you go. Thank you. Almighty god, we ask that you deliver your goodand true servant Tyler into the holy kingdomof heaven. God bless. So sorry for your loss, Ann. Thank you so much. It was such a beautiful service. Thank you. It was my honor. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you, Charles. Mrs. Danville, my deepest sympathies to you and your family. Thank you. The danvilles may be down, but we are not beaten. That's the spirit. Darling, I'd like you to meet Lyle Rosenbaum. Lyle, this is my son... Nathan danville. Good to finally meet you, nate. Pleasure. I just wanted you to knowthat we're getting an unbelievable responseto your candidacy. I knowthis isn't the right time, but when you feel up to it, we should have a sit-down. With the money your mother'sbringing to the table, we've got a good chanceof getting you to the capital. Actually, I haven't decided yet about running. But thank you very much for coming. My pleasure. I thought you saidthis was a done deal, Ann. You know the game, Lyle. He's playing hard to get. The full press has started. She's cashing in all our chips. You're not changing your mind, are you? No. She just won't take no for an answer. Nate! Nate danville! Dr. McManus! How does she know myname? Don't stop. Just keep walking. Ready, Ann? Yes. Do you have any idea where your stepdaughter was the night of the murder? In treatment. Excuse me. Isn't it true she ran away that night? That she was at your house? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on there. Now, I thoughti asked you to play fair, Jill. I'm just trying to do my job, sheriff. Well, why don't you let me do mine? You weren't planning on leaving without saying good-bye? No, of course not. I was just gonna put this in the car first. I knowyou have to get to work, but do you have a minute to talk? Sure. Sure. I wanted to thank you for coming here. You have been such a comfort to Nathan and to me. Thank you. But I think, under the circumstances, we didn't get a chanceto really know each other. Please. I completely agree. Not another word. Here. Come. Sit beside me. Let's just begin again, shall we? I'd like that very much. Heather... I feel it is my duty to tell you that a great many people are depending on my son to step up and claim his legacy. But what if natedoesn't want a legacy? Of course he wants it. Could you give up this life? That doesn't seem tobe the issue here, does it? My worry, of course, is... Are you the right woman for him? Nate seems to think so. He tells me you're quite committed to your career. Well, when you'repulling 18-hour shifts, it's kind of hard not to be. I'm sure there isn't enough time for anything else. Right? Work and sleep areabout all I can manage lately. So, where do marriage and... Children fit in? I mean, you do want children? Yes, yes. At some point, when the time is right. When the time is right. Car trouble? Nope. Everything's fine, sheriff. So, what are we doing here? Am I breaking some law? Only my lawabout not harassing the family. I heard Haley black ran away the night of the murder. I've heard she came to the house. I don't know where she went. Neither do you. So let's dothe right thing here. Keep this little mixed-up girlout of the news, shall we? What if she isthe news, sheriff? I wouldn't expect you to understand. But in the end, after all the squabbling and arguing, Nathan always knowswhat's best for the family. This wasmy husband James' desk. For eight years, it satin the governor's mansion. And now it will be my son's. I think it's importantthat you understand what will be expected of youas his wife, as the first lady. Of course, you willhave to give up your career. And you will have to devote all your time and energy to kids. I havea career, a jobi worked really hard to get. I want to impress upon you, Heather, that we are your family now. Ann. Please. Call me "mother." It's going to be so wonderful having the two of you live with us after you're married. This is all his for the taking, but he needs you. But I don't need this. Good-bye, Ann. Hold the elevator! Thanks. Yeah, you could die out here, waiting for it. Who is it? Jill quigley from kbla. What do you want? Five minutes... Girl scout's honor. Okay? So, you live here with Nate? For almost two years now, yeah. Nice guy, from what I've heard. First time at the ranch? The danvilles are like royalty up there. So it seems. I've been covering themfor years. At the funeral, how did you know my name? I'm a reporter, Heather. It's what I do. Nate show up with a girl. Who knows... She might be marryinginto the dynasty. Are you? I think you would have to ask Nate about that one. I would if I could, but like his mother, he won't speak with the press. Then why should I? I don't know. You might be different. You might want to learn things about the family. I know a lot. Like what? I heardshe's having money problems. Judging by the way she lives, I seriously doubt that. Well, then, why isshe quietly selling off pieces of their art collection? I don't know. Maybe she got tired of them. That's always possible, although I find it hard toimagine being tired of Matisse. What are you implying? Just that people get killedfor money every day. So you're suggesting that Ann danville killed her husband and then... what... Shot herself? I'm sorry. I really can't do this. You're gonna have to leave. By the way, did you know the handyman from the ranch is out in front of your apartment? What? Yeah, I saw him when I first pulled in. Thanks for your time. You should have joined me. You used to love to ride. I spoke to Heather. She told me about the ring. How could you do that? I only told her what you obviously haven't had the courage to tell her yourself. She gave back the ring because she wants her own life, not yours. Are you sure she wants you? We're getting married. Now, you can bea part of our lives or not. It's up to you. See how easy it is to get to you? Don't make me come back. Hey, baby. Nothing was taken, right? No. Is there anybody out there who might want to hurt you... Anybody from work, or a crazy patient pissed off about his insurance? There isa guy. He works for Ann danville. Thedanvilles? Yeah. This reporter, Jill quigley, she told meshe saw him out front. I only knowhis first name... Keith. We'll check it out. Are you gonna be okay alone here? Yeah, thanks. My fiancé is coming. Until we canget her declared incompetent, I don't want any repeat episodes. She won't be going anywhere again. We switched her meds to subcu. She was obviously cheeking them orally. That's the only reason I can think of that she was able to run off. Don't forgetwho's paying your bills. You mess this up, and your precious clinicwill be taken off life support. I know that. It's, - it's under control. Don't worry about it. You can see for yourself. I intend to. Leave us. Daddy's little rich girl. Leaving everything to you. How lovely. So you could spend it all on drugs. I don't know what you saw or didn't see, but if you ever say anything, I'll make sure you rot in here. Ann? Carl. what a wonderful surprise. Well, you might not think so. Have I been a bad girl, sheriff? I got a call from down in the city. They're investigating a break-in at your son's apartment. What? What about Heather? Is she okay? Yeah, she's fine. They just want to know about Keith. Some reporter placed him outside. What reporter? Jill quigley from the TV. Ifhe was in that apartment, this is serious business, Ann. I merely asked him to look for drugs. Heather was acting... Rather strangely when she was here, and, as her future mother-in-law, I was worried. Did you talk to Nate about this? Of course not. He is blindto any of her faults. If she has a problem, i want to know about it. All right. I can understand that. But Keith allegedly threatened her. He's always had a problemwith boundaries. You've got boundaries, too, Ann, and if you cross them again, I may not be able to protect you. I am so sorry, Carl. Your loyaltymeans the world to me. Hello, miss quigley. I was more than surprised when you called me, Mrs. Black. I've wanted to interview you for years. It's Mrs. Danville. Please make it right for your story. Certainly. Thank you for correcting me. I'm extremely grateful for the chance to finally get to speak with you, but why here? I do a lot of riding on my property, and I thought I'd reveala side of Ann danville that the, public doesn't know... How precious this land is to me, what it all represents. I understand. I don't think you do. Everything I do... My entire life... I've devotedto the good of this state, the state you live in, miss quigley. I know you meant well. Politics is a blood sport, and unfortunately, sometimes, one has toget their hands a little dirty. And sadly for you... this is one of those times. I will not let some nosy news bitch keep me from my work. Vera, where's mother? I don't know. She might be in the stables. Okay. Why don't you get some rest? I'll go talk to her about Keith. I don't feel safe with him around. I'm not gonna letanything happen to you. You know that, right? Okay. Okay. All right. Things that I hate... English, getting two d.U.I.S this month, wicked stepmothers. She's a pain in my ass. Things that I like... My dad, especially when he clears up my d.U.I.S, American history, my favorite band, black veil brides. Yeah, this is dumb. I mean, I'm... I'm just me. Mother! You don't have to shout. I'm right in here. What? Where's Keith? In Florida. Apparently, there's some family emergency. Well, he was at our apartment last night. That's just not possible. I had bill take him tothe airport yesterday afternoon. I've alreadyspoken to Carl about this. How's Heather? I hopeshe's not too traumatized. She's up at the house, resting. You brought her back here? I wasn't gonna leave her alone. Of course not. I think I need to lie down. Can you help me? Are you all right? I'm justa little light-headed. I... i shouldn't push myself so hard. I'm just not myself today. You have no idea how much I love you. We are still looking for the murder weapon. The autopsy confirmed the cause of death was from a .38-caliber handgun. That's about it. Except Mrs. Danville has upped the reward to half a million. Now I'll answer a few questions. Ooh-whee, that's a hell of a lot of money. Don't even think it. Why not? We deserve it, putting up with that witch for all these years. Becausewe can't prove nothin'. We both know whatmrs. Danville is capable of. She's lying. Maybe you were wrong. I am telling you, Nate, it was him. Why would she do that? To... to scare me off, away from you. And what ifthat reporter's right that Haley was here that night? Well, she would have told someone. Not if they're keepingher drugged so she can't talk. Are you suggesting that my mother killed her husband and then shot herself to cover it up? I am notsuggesting anything, Nate. That reporter did. Okay. Let's just say you're right, hypothetically. What's the motive? Money. She has money. How do you know? Just because she says she has? I just do. If she were worried about money, i would know. Then whyis she selling off pieces of your father's art collection? How do you know that? That reporter told me. Does she have proof? I didn't ask for any, nate. But you believe her and not me? Who's the beneficiaryof your stepfather's estate? His daughter. And ifshe's declared incompetent? My mother. All I want to do isat least try to talk to Haley. She knows something. I'll go with you. No, I think I should go alone. You saw what happenedlast time. Well, you're gonna need a car. Take my mother's. You keep her locked in? With her history, I'm afraid we have no choice now. What's the computer for? It's hers. I want to see her charts. I'm afraid that's not possible. You know the law. I'm a consulting physician. It's perfectly legal. Well, I'll need to verify that with the family. I'm sure you understand. I'd like to be alone with her, unless you need to talk to Ann danville about thatas well. No. Not at all. Haley? Haley, it's Heather, Nate's friend from the other day. I brought you something. Okay. I really like your profile. I was hoping we could be friends. I've alreadygiven the doctor her charts. Now we just need toget copies over to sick bay. Thanks. I want you to, cut Haley's meds. But you just raised them. Now I'm lowering them. Bring me her medical charts. Haley, who's this girl? She's a pain in my ass. What happened to her? Things that I like... Can you tell me? My dad... I really need to talk to her. Haley... Were you there that night? Did you see what happened to your father? Yeah, this is dumb. I mean, i'm... Haley, it will be okay. I'm gonna come back, and I'm gonna get you out of here. I promise. Hey, hal. X-ray tech to E.R. Hi. Doctor... How is she? She's gonna be okay. She has a broken arm, some internal bruising, but there's no sign of any bleeding. We are so relieved. Thank you, doctor. I want to keep her overnight for observation. I'm still a little concerned she may have suffered a concussion. Okay. Can I see her? Sure. I'll have the nurse take you back. Thanks. Come right this way. Heather. Hi. Hey. Some... Someone... hit me. They... they forced me off the road. Someone's... Who hit you? Someone hit me. Heather... Who hit you? Honey. Heather? It wasn't her fault. Did... did she see who it was? She... she's too out of it. She's had a terrible shock. Obviously, she's not thinking clearly. Why don'twe just wait until morning and let Carl handle this? I mean, right now, we should just be gratefulthat she's alive. Let's go home, baby. You should rest. For Heather. I mean, she'll need youto be strong. You know, darling, I didn't want to say anything before. But Dr. Burke called mefrom the clinic after Heather left. He was very concernedabout her erratic behavior. Erratic how? Thank you, Mandy. Here's the keys. You're a sweet girl. He said she seemed agitated, and he just wonderedif she was on, um, medication... You know, which is quite understandable after being accosted in your apartment. Well, she's a doctor. She knows what to take. Besides, she would have told me. I'm sure she would have. I was gonna waituntil she got better, but I was just so upset and... And hurt. About what? I can't believethat you didn't tell me I wasgoing to be a grandmother. What? Heather's not pregnant. I'm afraid she was. When you went in to see her, the doctor told methat she lost the baby. I mean, I assume that's why you weregetting engaged so hastily, you know, before I evenhad a chance to meet the girl. She didn't tell you? No, she didn't. Then I am so sorry. I... i just assumed that you knew. I mean, it is something one usuallyshares with your fiancé. Nate. No, let him go. Give him time to think about the kind of girlhe's going to marry. Hey, come on! It's about time. May I come in? You can't park there! Go and get me some ice! Where's my money? You'll get it tomorrow, along with a plane ticket out of my life. I don't walk around with $50,000 in cash, Keith. Well, maybe this will keep you company while you're waiting. She's alive. You failed me, Keith. What do you want me to do about it? If you're so good at killing... You do it, then. I couldn't sleep, either. Care for company? You know, it wouldn't be the first time she's lied to get what she wants. I was there. I didn't hear the doctor say anything about Heather being pregnant. It doesn't make any sense. She knowsl'll find out in the morning. But you'll spend all night questioning your relationship with Heather. That's what she wants. Isn't that what you're doing now? So, why would youtell me this? I thought you twowere friends. The only reason I came here was because she led me to believe I had a shot at getting you back. Seeing you and Heather together, I realized I didn't have a chance. Why did you stay? You're a hard man to give up. Look at your mother. Be quiet! You can't park there! Go and get me some ice! Nate, listen to me. I wouldn't be surprised if she killed Duke herself for the money. Duke cut her off a year ago. He was gonna leave her. Tonight, I realized just how dangerous your mother is. When she gets that money, all she'll need is you. For what? To get back the life she had with your father. Get some sleep. I took your advice, Carl, after your scolding yesterday, and I fired Keith. I thought he was gone for good, but he called me from the motel in town, drunk, and threatened me. Could you have a talk with him? Right here. Thank you. Keith? Open the door, Keith. Sheriff lovett. Would you open the door, please? Would you hold that, please? Yeah. Jeez. .38. Hell, this could be the one. I spilled. Can you clean yourself up? Why don't you be a good girl and go do it, then? Here. There you go. Can I borrow this?- Thank you. What is it, Burke? How hard is it to keep that little brat locked up?! Motel. The ex-convict was a chief suspect in the danville murder case. At this point in the investigation, authorities are refusing to comment. This is Carly Fisher reporting live, channel 5 news. Today's winner will receive a luxurious seven-day cruise to the Caribbean on one of the most fabulous cruise lines. Bill. I see you're working hard, as usual. I lost my leg on this spread. I've worked enough. Right. Iowe you. It's not enough that I keep you here, paying you wages so you can sit on your ass and watch game shows. You work Vera to the bone. I've never heard her complain. It's not in her nature. This .30-06 sure brings back memories. You and the governor, hunting, walking the fields. Careful with that. I keep it loaded. Those were the days, weren't they, Billy? You still had your leg. We had the governor's mansion... ran the entire state. What do you want, Ann? You never come down here. Haley ran away again. Is she here? She ain't here. You wouldn't lie to me? Look for yourself. I believe you. Half a million bucks. Are you interested in the reward, bill? Who wouldn't be? Do you know anything? I might. Vera, too. You should go to the police, then. And if I don't... What would it be worth? Why, Billy. Are you blackmailing me? I just want our due. Vera's about worn-out. And if I gave you... Your due? We'd be square. You'd never see us again. You heard about Keith? Carl told me. It's terrible, isn't it? Especially after everything this family has done for that boy. The way you treated him, I'm surprised he didn'ttry to kill you before this. That's a horrid thing to say! But then, you do horrible things, don't you, Mrs. Danville? I resent that. How could you lie to meabout Heather being pregnant? I didn't even think you were capable of being that manipulative. I merely informed you what the doctor told me. Really? Well, i spoke to him this morning. Nathan, where are you going? This was obviously just a misunderstanding. I'm going totake care of my wife. Your wife? Yeah, we got marriedin the hospital chapel. Nathan! How could youdeprive your mother of... Of watchingher only child get married?! Please! You did everything you could to break us up. May I remind youwhose ring you gave her? That was just a part of your twisted scheme. I'm sure you're overjoyed to have it back. I had no idea how muchyou obviously despise me. I don't despise you. In fact, I don't know how I feel about you anymore. I see. Where's Heather now? She's up at the house. And thenyou're leaving? Yeah, tomorrow. Right now, she needs to rest. Nathan. Dr. Burke called. Haley's better, and she... she asked to see you. Okay. We'll stop by on our way home tomorrow. No, no, no. No, I thinkyou really need to go today. Who knowswhen she'll be coherent again, you know, to talk? She may haveseen Keith kill her father. I mean, for her sake, i hope she didn't, but... You need to find out. Okay. I'll tell Heather. Let me. It will give mea chance to apologize. I know I haven't been very kind to her, and maybe in time, she can forgive me. Both of you. Please, darling? Okay. Nate? No, dear. It's mother. The first time I met you... Was it five days ago? It's hard to believe, isn't it? A lot's happened since then, Ann. That's right. And with everything that's happened... it's obvious to me now how deeplymy son is in love with you. Nothing... Nothingwill sway him from... From this devotion, not even the loveand devotion of his own mother. Do you knowhow much that hurts? I know you've been afraid of losing him, but that's not gonna happen. We're just going to live our own lives. No, you're not. Vera? You know, I was willingto be patient with you... A girl with no upbringing, no ideahow good families work. But Nathan knows. He knows nowthat you will never fit in. Where is he? Gone. You're lying. They needed him back at work. Public service hasalways been his first priority, just like his father. He would have told me. But he didn't. He asked me to. Then I'll just call him. Drop that phone! Drop it! I'll deal with you when I get back. Haley, hey, listen to me. Calm down. Just stay put till I get there. Hurry. I know she's not there, but he thinks she is. You keep him there until you hear from me, even if you have to drug him to... Vera? I'll call you back. Vera? Vera! Vera! Vera! Haley? Come out, come out, wherever you are! Come on. Haley! Are you upstairs? Where are you? Help me. Okay, okay. Do you know a way out? Yeah, through my room. I'm gonna find you! Haley! Haley! Come to mommy! Haley! Haley! We can sneak out this way. Okay. You've been a bad girl, Haley! Haley! Haley! Open this door! I know you're in there! Haley! Don't you move! Are you gonna kill me, too, Ann? You don't know who I am, do you? I am Ann danville, first lady... Revered, respected, loved. No one will doubt me... Not even my darling son. Move! Stop! She's in the house, and she's got Heather! Quick, get in the car. You're sick. You killed Keith, too, didn't you? He was obsessed with me, poor baby. When I rejected him, he tried to kill us. That doesn't explain why he tried to kill me, Ann. You were driving my car. And as for you, dear daughter-in-law... You had a tragic accident. Poor girl. It was the drugs. I tried to warn them. Now, jump! I said, "jump!" No! Ann. Ann! Now, listen to me, Ann! Ann, drop the weapon! You're just in time, carl. She... she was trying to kill me! She's lying! Shut up, bitch! Don't you see what she's doing, darling? Trying to come between a mother and her son... Breaking our beloved bond... Poisoning us. Put the gun down, mother. She'll never be one of us. Please. No. We... are the danvilles! 1-David-2, copy. Stand by for your e.T.A. Roger. 2-Charlie-5, stand by. Warrant check. 2-Charlie-5.
