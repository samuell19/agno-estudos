CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY WARNER BROS. [MARCH PLAYING] WE'RE NEW CADETS, SIR. YOU'RE NOT CADETS, AND I'M NOT "SIR." PULL IN YOUR CHIN! STAND AT ATTENTION WHEN YOU SPEAK TO A NONCOMMISSIONED OFFICER. BROWN. YES, SERGEANT. MARCH THESE PLEBES TO THE POST ADJUTANT'S OFFICE FOR ENROLLMENT. YES, SERGEANT. DETACHMENT, FORWARD MARCH! KEEP THOSE HEADS UP! LOOK TO YOUR FRONTS! PULL IN YOUR CHINS! PLEBES, HALT! NEW SET OF GENERALS, EH, CAPTAIN? THEY'RE IN THE ARMY NOW, COLONEL. FINE-LOOKING MESS OF MANHOOD. ABOUT FACE! RIGHT FACE! RIGHT FACE! KEEP THOSE HEADS UP. HIGHER. HIGHER! FORWARD... AND TO DOUBLE-TIME, MARCH! COME ON, GET THOSE HEAD UP. PEP IT UP THERE! PEP IT UP THERE! GET YOUR HEADS UP! YOU'RE PRETTY FRESH FOR A CADET CORPORAL, AREN'T YOU, SHARP? MAYBE I CAN AFFORD TO BE, SERGEANT. ONE OF THESE DAYS, YOU'RE GOING TO TRIP UP THE WRONG LAD AND FIND YOURSELF FLAT ON YOUR FACE, AND YOUR OLD MAN'S MONEY WON'T HELP YOU ANY. THAT'S THE TROUBLE WITH THE ARMY, SERGEANT, MAKES NO DISTINCTIONS. NO. YOU'RE ALL ALIKE WHEN YOU GET HERE, AND WE DON'T SAY "WELCOME TO WEST POINT" AND TURN OUT A GUARD IN HONOR OF ANY CADET. [HOUNDS BAYING] HERE'S SOMEBODY YOU'LL TURN OUT A GUARD FOR. MUST BE A BRIGADIER GENERAL, AT LEAST. [WHISTLES] SOME FOREIGNER CALLING ON THE COMMANDANT. TURN OUT THE GUARD. GENERAL OFFICER. TURN OUT THE GUARD! GENERAL OFFICER! FALL IN! PRESENT... ARMS! ORDER...ARMS! WELCOME TO WEST POINT, SIR. MAY I DIRECT YOU TO THE COMMANDANT? YES, IF HE'S THE PROPER PERSON FOR ME TO SEE. I'M MR. CUSTER. GEORGE ARMSTRONG CUSTER OF MONROE, MICHIGAN. I'VE BEEN APPOINTED TO THE ACADEMY AS A CADET. WELCOME TO WEST POINT. NICE WORK, SARGE. DISMISS THE GUARD! WELL, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR, SHARP? TAKE CHARGE OF THIS MAN. I'LL SHOW YOU TO YOUR QUARTERS, MR. CUSTER. WILL YOU BE KIND ENOUGH TO FOLLOW ME? WHAT ABOUT THESE HOUNDS? OH, DON'T WORRY ABOUT THEM. THEY'LL FOLLOW ME. UNLEASH THEM, BOY. AND HERE'S A DOLLAR FOR YOURSELF. THANK YOU, SIR. WELL... I'VE DONE 4 HITCHES IN THE U.S. CAVALRY. I THOUGHT I'D SEEN EVERYTHING, BUT YOU CAN CALL ME A MARINE IF THAT ISN'T THE STRA-- YOU FAVOR CAVALIER BOOTS, I SEE, MR. CUSTER. THAT'S BECAUSE I'M GOING INTO THE CAVALRY, MR. SHARP. IN MY OPINION, AN INFANTRYMAN'S NO BETTER THAN A BEAST OF BURDEN. YOU HAVE DEFINITE IDEAS, MR. CUSTER. WHAT MADE YOU HONOR THE ARMY BY CHOOSING IT AS A CAREER? GLORY, MR. SHARP, GLORY. I WANT TO LEAVE A NAME BEHIND ME THAT THE NATION WILL HONOR. THERE'S A GREAT MANY MORE STATUES FOR SOLDIERS THAN THERE ARE CIVILIANS, I'VE NOTICED. I'M SURE YOU'LL FIT RIGHT IN WITH THE STATUES, MR. CUSTER, JUST LIKE PART OF THE HORSE. WELL, HERE WE ARE, MR. CUSTER. HANG THESE ORDERLIES. THEY HAVEN'T MOVED PINCHBELLY'S THINGS YET. BUT DON'T YOU WORRY, MR. CUSTER, WE'LL FIX THAT RIGHT AWAY. WILL YOU GIVE ME A HAND WITH THIS JUNK HERE, MR. CUSTER? OH, CERTAINLY, MR. SHARP. I TRUST I'M NOT INCONVENIENCING ANYBODY. OH, NO, NO, MR. CUSTER. ON THE CONTRARY, IT'S YOU WHO HAVE BEEN INCONVENIENCED. OH, NOT AT ALL. WELL, I HOPE YOU'LL BE COMFORTABLE HERE. OF COURSE, AS A FIRST-YEAR MAN, YOU DON'T RATE A SUITE. NO, OF COURSE NOT. WELL, CONFIDENTIALLY, MR. SHARP, THESE QUARTERS ARE A GREAT DEAL BETTER THAN THOSE I'M ACCUSTOMED TO AT HOME. OH, IS THAT SO? MY, THAT'S A-- THAT'S A DASHING-LOOKING OUTFIT YOU'RE WEARING, MR. CUSTER. OH, THANK YOU, MR. SHARP. YES, WE'VE--WE'VE NOTHING TO COMPARE WITH IT HERE. HAVEN'T YOU? I HAD IT TAILOR-MADE IN MONROE. I WANTED THE FOLKS TO SEE ME IN UNIFORM BEFORE I LEFT. DID YOU, UH, DESIGN IT YOURSELF, MR. CUSTER? WELL, NO, BUT IF YOU'VE A MOMENT TO SPARE, I'LL SHOW YOU WHERE I GOT THE IDEA. OH, CERTAINLY. HERE. ONE OF THE GREATEST HEROES WHO EVER LIVED, MR. SHARP. MURAT, THE KING OF CAVALRYMEN. HE WAS KNOWN AS THE THUNDERBOLT, AND HIS ONE TACTIC WAS... "RIDE TO THE SOUND OF THE GUNS." HMM. I MUST GET MYSELF A TIGER SKIN AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. QUITE A FELLOW. OH, YES. WELL, I MUST BE RUNNING. I'M SORRY, WE CAN'T MAKE ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE DOGS UNTIL TOMORROW, THOUGH. OH, THINK NOTHING OF IT, MR. SHARP. THEY'RE ACCUSTOMED TO SLEEPING WITH ME ANYWAY. OH, AND THANKS VERY MUCH FOR YOUR KINDNESS TO ME. WELL, CAESAR, WHAT DO YOU WANT, HMM? WHY, YOU KNOW YOU DON'T LIKE ONIONS. WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU? OH, YOU WANT YOUR BONES, EH? COME ON. COME ON. COME ON. COME ON. OVER HERE. HERE, CAESAR. COME ON, HANNIBAL. COME ON. HERE YOU ARE. HERE. HERE, CLEOPATRA. THERE YOU ARE. HERE. THERE YOU ARE. HANNIBAL. WHAT THE CONTINENTAL BLUE BLAZES IS THIS?! OH. [CLEARING THROAT] SORRY. SORRY? SORRY. I DIDN'T HEAR YOU KNOCK. YOU DIDN'T HEAR ME KNOCK? UH... ANYTHING I CAN DO FOR YOU? YES, THERE IS. YOU CAN TELL ME WHAT YOU AND YOUR CONFOUNDED MENAGERIE ARE DOING HERE IN MY QUARTERS, YOU CAN TELL ME WHY MY EFFECTS HAVE BEEN THROWN OUT INTO THE HALL, YOU CAN TELL ME FROM WHAT LUNATIC ASYLUM YOU ESCAPED, AND YOU CAN TELL ME HOW YOU'RE HERE IN THAT COMIC-OPERA UNIFORM INSTEAD OF AT A FANCY-DRESS BALL. WELL, SIR, EXPLAIN! MY NAME'S CUSTER, SIR-- CADET GEORGE ARMSTRONG CUSTER-- AND I WAS ASSIGNED TO THESE QUARTERS. OH, YOU WERE, WERE YOU? WELL, I'M MAJOR ROMULUS TAIPE, QUARTERMASTER AND COMMANDEER OF CADETS, AND THIS HAPPENS TO BE MY QUARTERS. AND YOU'RE AN IMBECILE. WHO BROUGHT YOU HERE? WELL, WHO BROUGHT YOU HERE? I ASKED YOU A QUESTION. WHO BROUGHT YOU HERE? WHAT'S HIS NAME? [BUGLE PLAYS CALL] MUDD. MUDD? THERE'S NO SUCH NAME AT THE ACADEMY. ARE YOU PRESUMING TO TRIFLE WITH ME? WELL, DON'T YOU HEAR THAT CALL? IT'S INSPECTION FOR NEW CADETS. GET OUT AND FALL IN! I DON'T THINK YOUR STAY WILL BE VERY LONG WITH US, MR. CUSTER. I'M RECOMMENDING YOU FOR A MENTAL EXAMINATION. GET OUT! GET OUT! GET OUT, CONFOUND IT! GET OUT OF HERE! GET OUT! GET OUT OF HERE! NEW CADETS, FALL IN! GET IN LINE. STRAIGHTEN UP THAT RANK. PREPARE FOR INSPECTION! ADJUST YOUR CHIN STRAP. YES, SIR. WHAT KIND OF SLOPPINESS DO YOU CALL THAT? FIX YOUR BELT. TAKE HIS NAME, SERGEANT. YES, SIR. SEE THAT THESE MEN ARE INSTRUCTED IN THE PROPER WAY TO WEAR THEIR UNIFORMS. EXTRA DRILL, IF NECESSARY. YES, SIR. EYES FRONT, THAT MAN. I SAID, EYES FRONT! THAT MEANS YOU, MARSHAL MURAT. WELL, IT'S GOING TO TAKE EVEN LESS TIME TO GET RID OF YOU THAN I SUSPECTED, MR. CUSTER. SERGEANT, PUT THIS MANIAC UNDER ARREST. TAKE HIM BEFORE COLONEL SHERIDAN. YES, SIR. RIGHT FACE! FORWARD...MARCH! MR. CUSTER, YOU ARE CHARGED WITH A VERY GRAVE OFFENSE. DIDN'T YOU KNOW THAT STRIKING A SUPERIOR IS ONE OF THE MOST SERIOUS OF MILITARY OFFENSES, PUNISHABLE IN SOME CASES WITH DEATH? WHY DID YOU STRIKE MR. SHARP? I'M AFRAID I CAN'T SAY, SIR. IT WAS A PERSONAL MATTER. THERE ARE NO PERSONAL MATTERS ON THE PARADE GROUND. HAVE YOU ANYTHING FURTHER TO SAY? NO, SIR. THEN I HAVE NO ALTERNATIVE BUT TO DISMISS YOU FROM THE ACADEMY. DISMISS? OH, I DIDN'T KNOW YOU COULD GET FIRED FROM THE ARMY FOR FIGHTING. Taipe: WELL, YOU KNOW IT NOW. WHAT IS YOUR LISTING, MR. CUSTER? LISTING? YES, LISTING. IT'S ON THE FORM. THE FORM YOU SIGNED IN THE ADJUTANT'S OFFICE. WHAT FORM? I DIDN'T SIGN ANY FORM. I HAVEN'T BEEN TO THE ADJUTANT'S OFFICE. DO YOU MEAN THAT YOU HAVEN'T SUBSCRIBED TO THE ARTICLES OF WAR? NO, SIR. AHEM. IN THAT CASE, CUSTER, WE CERTAINLY CAN'T FIRE YOU FROM THE ARMY, BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT IN THE ARMY. YOU'VE BEEN PRETTY LUCKY. LET THIS BE A LESSON TO YOU. TAKE HIM OVER TO THE POST ADJUTANT, SERGEANT. YES, SIR. I'D LIKE TO THANK-- ABOUT FACE! I'D JUST LIKE TO-- FORWARD...MARCH! THANKS ANYWAY, SIR. YOU KNOW, TAIPE, I'M GLAD IT TURNED OUT THIS WAY. THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT THAT FELLOW I LIKE. YEAH? WELL, I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS. YOU ASK ME, HE'LL MAKE THE WORST RECORD OF ANY CADET AT WEST POINT SINCE ULYSSES S. GRANT. AT FULL CHARGE, A 12-POUND SHELL WILL BURST INTO APPROXIMATELY 50 FRAGMENTS. MR. CUSTER! YES, SIR. YOU KNOW HOW MANY FRAGMENTS WILL A 12-POUND SHELL BURST? OH, UM... CERTAINLY NOT LESS THAN 2, SIR. HA HA HA! HA HA HA! HAROLD McCORD. [APPLAUSE] RONALD McKENZIE. [APPLAUSE] FRANCIS DUPONT. [APPLAUSE] CONGRATULATIONS, MR. DUPONT. THANK YOU, SIR. EDWARD SHARP. GOOD LUCK, MR. SHARP. THANK YOU, SIR. I NEVER THOUGHT I'D ENVY THAT TOAD, GRADUATING AHEAD OF ME. I'D CERTAINLY LIKE TO BE IN HIS BOOTS TODAY, THOUGH. WHY? WHY? BECAUSE IF ABRAHAM LINCOLN GETS ELECTED IN NOVEMBER, THERE'S GOING TO BE A SHOOTING WAR, AND SHARP WILL BE IN IT. AW, BUNKUM. IT'S ALL TALK, CUSTER. THERE'LL BE NO WAR. NO? WELL, YOU WAIT AND SEE, ROSSER. I TELL YOU, IF LINCOLN GETS ELECTED, THE SOUTH WILL FIGHT. [BAND PLAYS MILITARY MARCH] [DRUM CORPS PLAYING] BATTALION... TEN-HUT. YOU ARE ABOUT TO HEAR AN ORDER READ BY A CIVILIAN MEMBER OF THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT. SENATOR SMITH. GENTLEMEN, BECAUSE OF A PRESENT CRISIS IN THE AFFAIRS OF THE NATION WHICH MENACES ARMED REBELLION AND DESTRUCTION OF THE SACRED UNION ESTABLISHED BY OUR FATHERS, IT HAS BEEN DECREED BY CONGRESS THAT EVERY OFFICER AND CADET OF THE ACADEMY SHALL SUBSCRIBE HIS NAME TO THE FOLLOWING OATH. I SWEAR TO MAINTAIN AND DEFEND THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE UNITED STATES AS PARAMOUNT TO ALL ALLEGIANCE OR FEALTY I MAY OWE TO ANY STATE OR TERRITORY... SO HELP ME GOD. ANY OFFICER OR CADET WHO FINDS HIMSELF UNABLE TO COMPLY WITH ITS REQUIREMENTS WILL FALL OUT TO THE RIGHT OF THE BATTALION. GENTLEMEN OF THE SOUTH... FALL OUT! I SEE I WAS NOT MISINFORMED AS TO THE PREPONDERANCE OF TRAITORS AT WEST POINT. IT'S HIGH TIME THAT CONGRESS ACTED TO CLEAN OUT THIS NEST OF SECESSIONISTS. WE DON'T CONCERN OURSELVES WITH THE MAKING OF WARS HERE, SENATOR. ONLY THE FIGHTING OF THEM. THE ACADEMY LEAVES EACH MAN TO HIS OWN SENSE OF HONOR. GENTLEMEN OF THE SOUTH, FALL IN! UNITED STATES MILITARY ACADEMY... CLOSE TO THE LEFT! GENTLEMEN, I AM SORRY THAT OUR COMRADESHIP MUST END IN THESE UNHAPPY CIRCUMSTANCES. WE HAVE LIVED AS SOLDIERS, AND POLITICS HAVE HAD NO PLACE AMONG US. LET US PART THEN AS WE HAVE LIVED-- IN THE DETERMINATION TO DO OUR DUTY, WHEREVER IT MAY LIE. HAVE WE YOUR PERMISSION TO MOVE OFF, SIR? MOVE OFF, CAPTAIN FITZHUGH LEE. SHOULDER... ARMS! BANDMASTER, SOUND DIXIE! [BAND PLAYS DIXIE] COMPANY, LEFT... FACE! BATTALION... MARCH! EYES... LEFT! PRESENT...ARMS! FORWARD! FRANKLY, I DISLIKE THE IDEA OF GRADUATING JUNIOR CLASS MEN. EMERGENCY OR NO EMERGENCY, A HALF-BAKED OFFICER IS WORSE THAN NONE AT ALL. BUT I COULDN'T MAKE THE WAR DEPARTMENT SEE IT. AT LEAST THE SELECTION IS LEFT IN OUR HANDS. WELL, LET'S TAKE THEM ALPHABETICALLY. WHO'S FIRST? CADET, UH, PERCIVAL ANDERSON. ANDERSON. DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE MADE MUCH IMPRESSION ON ME. ANDERSON'S NOT THE CONSPICUOUS TYPE, SIR. BUT HIS RECORD SPEAKS FOR HIM. NO DEMERITS. THAT MIGHT MEAN HE'S DEVOTED HIMSELF TO KEEPING OUT OF TROUBLE. I THINK ANDERSON WILL BE THE BETTER OFF FOR ANOTHER YEAR. AS A SENIOR, HE'D HAVE TO ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY AND MAKE DECISIONS. I KNOW, SIR, BUT-- NEXT! GEORGE ARMSTRONG CUSTER. WELL, THERE'S NOTHING INCONSPICUOUS ABOUT HIM, IS THERE? NO, SIR, NOTHING. NOTHING AT ALL. HE HAS NO REGARD FOR DISCIPLINE, ORGANIZATION, NOR TACTICS. AND AS FOR HIS RECORD, GEORGE ARMSTRONG CUSTER HAS THE LOWEST MARKS AND THE HIGHEST DEMERITS OF ANY CADET WHO EVER ATTENDED THIS ACADEMY, INCLUDING ULYSSES S. GRANT. HMM. I WONDER WHAT HAPPENED TO GRANT. WELL, WHAT ABOUT CUSTER? HE'S THE BEST RIDER AND THE BEST SWORDSMAN WE HAVE. HE SEEMS ENDOWED WITH A SINGULAR AGGRESSIVENESS. A SINGULAR AGGRESSIVENESS. YES, THE TYPE THAT WINS BRAWLS, NOT BATTLES. I TELL YOU, SIR, THAT-- WHAT IS YOUR OPINION OF HIS QUALITY FOR COMMAND? A SQUADRON WOULD FOLLOW HIM TO HELL. YOU'RE FORGETTING YOURSELF, SERGEANT. AS I WAS SAYING, SIR, CUSTER'S THE TYPE THAT WINS BRAWLS, NOT BATTLES. RIGHT AT THIS VERY MOMENT, HE'S DOING A PUNISHMENT TOUR FOR HIS LATEST ESCAPADE. CUSTER, CARRY THAT RIFLE PROPERLY AND QUICKEN THE PACE. HUH? WHY? NOBODY'S LOOKING AT ME. QUIET! YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO TALK ON PUNISHMENT TOUR! MOVE ON! I HOPE YOU WON'T THINK ME BOLD FOR ADDRESSING A STRANGER, BUT I--I'M ELIZABETH BACON OF MONROE, AND I THINK I'M LOST. OH, BUT I'M SPEAKING TO YOU. I'M TRYING TO FIND COLONEL SHERIDAN'S HOUSE. MY FATHER HAS SOME BUSINESS AT THE COMMANDANT'S OFFICE, AND HE THOUGHT HE'D BE RATHER A LONG WHILE, SO HE TOLD ME TO GO AHEAD AND FIND THE HOUSE MYSELF. WELL, YOU SEE HOW I FOUND IT. I KNOW IT SOUNDS SILLY GETTING LOST AT WEST POINT, BUT IT'S SUCH A BIG PLACE, AND I'VE NEVER BEEN HERE BEFORE, AND I'VE FORGOTTEN ALL MY FATHER'S DIRECTIONS. YOU SEE, I TOOK THAT PATH OVER THERE BY THE ROSE GARDEN, AND WHEN I GOT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROSE GARDEN, I TURNED TO ADMIRE THE VIEW-- REALLY, SIR. I'VE BEEN JUST AS CAREFULLY BROUGHT UP AS YOU HAVE, AND I THINK IF I CAN MAKE SO BOLD AS TO SPEAK TO A STRANGER, THE LEAST YOU CAN DO IS TO REPLY, PARTICULARLY WHEN THAT STRANGER'S A LADY. I'VE TOLD YOU WHO I AM AND WHERE I COME FROM AND WHAT MY FATHER'S BUSINESS IS HERE, AND THAT CERTAINLY, IN AN EMERGENCY, SHOULD BE INTRODUCTION ENOUGH. AND THE LEAST YOU CAN DO IS STAND STILL WHEN I'M SPEAKING TO YOU. THAT'S BETTER. OH. OH! I'VE NEVER BEEN SO OUTRAGEOUSLY TREATED IN ALL MY LIFE! I ALWAYS THOUGHT WEST POINT WAS A PLACE FOR GENTLEMEN! I ALWAYS THOUGHT OUR ARMY WAS COMPOSED OF THE FLOWER OF OUR COUNTRY! I SHALL TELL MY FATHER ABOUT THIS. I SHALL TELL COLONEL SHERIDAN ABOUT THIS! OH, YOU NEEDN'T START BACK NOW. IT'S TOO LATE. YOU CAN REHEARSE ALL THE APOLOGIES YOU LIKE, BUT I SHAN'T STAY HERE TO LISTEN TO ANY OF THEM. GOOD DAY, SIR. MR. CUSTER. YOU'RE WANTED AT THE COMMANDANT'S OFFICE IMMEDIATELY. YOU'D BETTER GET THERE AT THE DOUBLE QUICK. RIGHT. HANG ON TO THIS, WILL YOU, SERGEANT? THAT ISN'T THE RIGHT DIRECTION! OH, YES, IT IS! MISS BACON. MISS BACON. PLEASE, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND. I COULDN'T SPEAK TO YOU. IT'S AGAINST REGULATIONS. DO YOU UNDERSTAND? HALT! IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR COLONEL SHERIDAN'S HOUSE, THIS IS THE RIGHT WAY. I'M VERY SORRY IF I SEEMED RUDE, BUT, YOU SEE, WHILE YOU'RE WALKING GUARD DUTY, YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO TALK TO ANYONE ABOUT ANYTHING. WELL, THEN WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY SO? WELL, I COULDN'T SPEAK. OH, YOU MEAN YOU COULDN'T SPEAK! NO! I MEAN, YES! UH, I COULDN'T. OH! HO HO HO! HA HA. OH. WELL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH, SIR. AND NOW THAT I'VE REACHED MY DESTINATION, I-- OH, MISS BACON? MISS BACON, PLEASE DON'T GO INSIDE YET. THERE'S SOMETHING I WANT TO SAY TO YOU. YOU SEE, I'M FROM MONROE, TOO. I CAN'T TALK NOW. I'M DUE AT THE COMMANDANT'S OFFICE, AND IF I KEEP COLONEL SHERIDAN WAITING... YOU CAN TELL UNCLE PHIL YOU WERE WITH ME. UNCLE PHIL? COLONEL SHERIDAN. OH, IS HE YOUR UNCLE? NOT EXACTLY, BUT, YOU SEE, HE AND MY FATHER ARE OLD FRIENDS. WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL, I USED TO SIT ON HIS KNEE. OH, I SEE. WELL, I'M CERTAINLY GLAD YOU NEVER SAT ON MY KNEE. SIR? OH, I DON'T MEAN IT THAT WAY, MISS BACON. IF YOU HAD BEEN LITTLE ENOUGH TO SIT ON MY KNEE, YOU'D HAVE BEEN TOO OLD FOR ME NOW-- I MEAN, I'D HAVE BEEN TOO OLD FOR YOU NOW. OH. LOOK, MISS BACON, I REALLY MUST GO NOW, BUT DO YOU THINK IF I WERE TO COME STROLLING PAST YOUR HOUSE AROUND 9:00 AT NIGHT, YOU MIGHT BE JUST SITTING AROUND ON THE VERANDAH? LIFE IS FULL OF SURPRISES. AND IF I DID FIND YOU SITTING ON THE PORCH, PERHAPS YOU AND I COULD GO FOR A WALK TOGETHER. WE SEEM TO HAVE BEEN WALKING TOGETHER EVER SINCE WE'VE MET. WELL, I CAN'T IMAGINE, MA'AM, IF I MAY SAY SO, ANY PLEASANTER JOURNEY, MA'AM, THAN WALKING THROUGH LIFE WITH YOU BESIDE ME, MA'AM. I MUST GO NOW. CADET CUSTER, SIR, REPORTING AS ORDERED. MR. CUSTER, HAVE YOU ANY IDEA WHY I SENT FOR YOU? NO, SIR. DO YOU KNOW THAT YOU HAVE THE WORST RECORD OF ANY CADET THAT WEST POINT HAS HAD IN YEARS? YES, SIR. Sheridan: WHY? I DON'T KNOW, SIR. THAT'S BEEN PUZZLING ME, TOO. WELL, SINCE YOU CAN'T ANSWER THAT QUESTION, PERHAPS YOU CAN TELL ME WHY, ON THE VERY EVE OF YOUR CHANCE TO GRADUATE, YOU BECOME INVOLVED IN AN UNDIGNIFIED BRAWL WITH A CIVILIAN. IT WASN'T A CIVILIAN, SIR. OH, NO. JUST A MARINE. [CLEARS THROAT] OH. WELL, MARINE OR CIVILIAN, MOST UNBECOMING BEHAVIOR FOR A WEST POINT CADET TO ENGAGE IN FISTICUFFS ON A PUBLIC STREET. ONLY EXTREME PROVOCATION WOULD CALL FOR SUCH CONDUCT. THAT'S JUST WHAT IT WAS, SIR. HE SAID HE'D BEEN THROUGH 2 WARS AND NEVER SEEN A DEAD CAVALRYMAN. WHAT? WHY-- WELL, I TRUST WHEN HE RECOVERS FROM YOUR, UH, REPROOF THAT HE'LL BE TAKEN OUT TO THE CEMETERY AND SHOWN THE GRAVE OF LIGHT HORSE HARRY LEE. [LAUGHTER] MR. CUSTER, I SUPPOSE YOU HAD HOPED TO GRADUATE WITH THE REST OF YOUR CLASS? YES, SIR. AND IF YOU HAD GRADUATED, WHAT WERE YOUR PLANS? OH, AN ASSIGNMENT TO THE SECOND CAVALRY, SIR. THAT'S THE FINEST REGIMENT IN THE ARMY. BUT I'M AFRAID THERE WON'T BE ANY VACANCIES LEFT IF THE OTHERS BEAT ME TO WASHINGTON. IN THAT CASE, I SUGGEST YOU LEAVE ON THE NEXT TRAIN. SIR? YOU MEAN, I-- YOU ARE THE LAST OF THE CLASS TO BE GRADUATED. THE OTHERS HAVE ALREADY RECEIVED THEIR DIPLOMAS. THANK YOU, SIR. AND I TRUST THAT YOUR FUTURE CONDUCT AS AN OFFICER OF THE UNITED STATES ARMY WILL JUSTIFY MY CONFIDENCE IN YOU. YES, SIR. THANK YOU, SIR. AND NOW... THAT TRAIN LEAVES IN AN HOUR. YES, SIR. OH. IN AN HOUR, SIR? I'M AFRAID I'LL HAVE TO CATCH THE LATE TRAIN, SIR. WHAT? WHY? WELL, I, UH... WELL, YOU SEE, I... I SENT MY LAUNDRY OUT YESTERDAY, AND IT HASN'T COME BACK YET, SIR. [LAUGHTER] YOU'VE BEEN RUNNING FOR 3 YEARS TO CATCH THAT TRAIN. I SUGGEST THAT YOU KEEP ON RUNNING-- YES, SIR, BUT-- WITH OR WITHOUT YOUR LAUNDRY. YES, SIR. THANK YOU, SIR. OH, FATHER. HELLO, MY DEAR. BACK FROM YOUR WALK ALREADY? WHAT ARE YOU DOING SITTING HERE ALONE? OH, IT'S SUCH A LOVELY NIGHT THAT I JUST DIDN'T WANT TO GO INSIDE. MM-HMM. SOUNDS AS IF YOU'RE FALLING IN LOVE WITH, UH... WEST POINT. OH, IT'S A BEAUTIFUL PLACE. ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU HAVE A HANDSOME YOUNG CADET TO SHOW IT TO YOU IN THE MOONLIGHT. I DIDN'T GO FOR MY WALK. WHY NOT? HE DIDN'T COME BACK. HE DIDN'T COME-- WHY, THE YOUNG SCOUNDREL! A WEST POINT CADET IS SUPPOSED TO BE AN OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN. I'LL SPEAK TO COLONEL SHERIDAN ABOUT HIM. THE INSOLENT PUPPY! WHAT'S HIS NAME? I DON'T KNOW, AND YOU MUSTN'T TALK ABOUT HIM LIKE THAT. AND WHY NOT? BECAUSE HE'S THE MAN I'M GOING TO MARRY! Corporal: HOW DOES THE ADJUTANT GENERAL FEEL THIS MORNING? HE'S BARKING LIKE A FOX! ANY ORDERS FOR ME YET, CORPORAL? NO, LIEUTENANT CUSTER. I'M SICK OF HANGING AROUND WAITING TO SEE THE ADJUTANT GENERAL. I'VE WRITTEN HIM TIME AFTER TIME ASKING FOR AN ASSIGNMENT TO A REGIMENT, AND I DON'T GET ANY ANSWER. NOW, BY JUDAS, I'M GOING IN TO SEE HIM IN PERSON. HE'LL SEE NO ONE EXCEPT BY APPOINTMENT. HE WON'T, EH? HAH. [WOMAN SCREAMS] Custer: HELP! FIRE! SPIES! SABOTAGE! WHAT IS ALL THIS? GET THE FIRE BRIGADE! GET WATER! GET WATER, YOU IDIOTS! [YELLING] WELL... WHY, MAJOR TAIPE. I'M VERY GLAD TO SEE YOU, SIR. WOULD YOU MIND SAYING A WORD TO THE ADJUTANT GENERAL ON MY BEHALF? I'VE BEEN WAITING WEEKS TO BE ASSIGNED-- I HAVE A FEELING THAT YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS CONFUSION. BUT IT WILL SERVE YOU TO NO PURPOSE... BECAUSE I HAPPEN TO BE THE ADJUTANT GENERAL. ALSO, I HAPPEN TO BE WELL AWARE THAT YOU'VE BEEN AWAITING AROUND FOR ORDERS. AND YOU'LL CONTINUE TO WAIT UNTIL EVERY COMPETENT OFFICER HAS BEEN ASSIGNED TO ACTIVE DUTY. AND THEN, MR. CUSTER, I MAY FIND A PLACE FOR YOU... TRAINING INFANTRY RECRUITS! GOOD DAY! YOU AIN'T DONE MUCH WITH YOUR SOUP, BOSS. DON'T LIKE? NO, IT'S ALL RIGHT, BUT YOU CAN TAKE IT AWAY. YES, SIR. GOT SOMETHING OVER HERE THAT'LL EXCITE YOUR PALATE. YES, SIR. CREAMED ONIONS. SPECIALTY OF THE HOUSE, SIR. EVER SINCE PRESIDENT ANDREW JACKSON'S TIME. SAY, WAIT A MIN-- ISN'T THAT GENERAL SCOTT, GENERAL WINFIELD SCOTT? HOW DO YOU DO, CHARLES? VERY WELL, THANK YOU. KIND OF LATE TODAY, GENERAL. AH, THESE ARE BUSY TIMES, CHARLES. BUSY TIMES. YES, SIR, THAT'S THE GENERAL. COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF. A POWERFUL EATIN' GENTLEMAN, SIR. ONLY TIME FOR A SNACK, CHARLES. I'LL HAVE MY HORS D'OEUVRES, SOUP, DOUBLE RIB SIRLOIN, POTATOES AU GRATIN, ASPARAGUS, SPICED PEARS, AND, OF COURSE, THE CREAMED BERMUDA ONIONS. I'M DESOLATE, GENERAL. THE LAST PORTION OF BERMUDA ONIONS JUST BEEN SERVED. I'LL PREPARE MORE MYSELF, IF YOU'LL JUST WAIT. WAIT, MAN, WAIT? WITH THE SOUTHERN PATROL AT MANASSAS? THIS IS WAR, CHARLES, WAR. I'LL ORDER THE SWEET LATER. YES, SIR. PARDON ME, SIR. MR. CUSTER, SIR. I COULDN'T HELP OVERHEARING WHAT YOU SAID, GENERAL. THESE ONIONS HAVE JUST BEEN SERVED ME. I'D DEEM IT A PLEASURE, SIR, IF YOU'D ACCEPT THEM. THAT'S VERY GENEROUS, BUT I COULDN'T DEPRIVE YOU OF THEM. [SNIFFING] THAT IS, OF ALL OF THEM. HA HA HA HA! WILL YOU LUNCH WITH ME? THANK YOU, SIR. [CUSTER LAUGHING] HO HO. THAT'S A GOOD ONE, SIR. YOU MENTIONED HAVING NO APPETITE. HOW DO YOU ACCOUNT FOR THAT? I THINK I LOST IT IN THE ADJUTANT GENERAL'S OFFICE, SIR. CAMPING AROUND THERE FOR 3 WEEKS WAITING FOR AN ASSIGNMENT, AND ALL THE TIME, THE REBELS ROLLING DOWN ON WASHINGTON. INDEED? HOW DID YOU DO AT WEST POINT? WELL, SIR, FIRST IN EQUITATION, SIR, FIRST IN SWORDPLAY. AND STUDIES? UH-UH. I WAS AFRAID YOU'D ASK THAT, SIR. LAST. HA HA HA HA! CONFIDENTIALLY, YOUNG MAN, I SAW THE WEST POINT EXAMINATION PAPERS MYSELF. AND THE ONLY QUESTION I COULD HAVE ANSWERED WAS, NAME THE PRESENT COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE UNITED STATES ARMY. HA HA HA HA! MR. CUSTER, I THINK YOU BETTER WALK ACROSS THE STREET WITH ME... AS SOON AS WE'VE DISPOSED OF THE BERMUDAS. RIGHT, SIR. WHAT-- HA HA HA HA HA! OH, I'M SORRY! I WARN YOU, CUSTER, IT'S A FATAL MISTAKE TO STEAM ONIONS. EVEN WHEN THEY'RE SEALED IN CONTAINERS, SIR? UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. YOU STEAM ALL THE BEST OUT OF THEM. GENERAL, YOU CERTAINLY KNOW YOUR ONIONS. HOLD HIM HERE, JONES. I MAY NEED HIM LATER. MR. TAIPE, YOU'RE THE MAN WE WANT TO SEE. POST THIS OFFICER TO THE SECOND CAVALRY. I KNOW THEY HAVE A VACANCY BECAUSE I DREW ON THEM FOR AN AIDE THIS MORNING. YES, SIR. YOU'VE NO OBJECTIONS TO THE SECOND? IF THERE'S EVER A FINER REGIMENT IN THE CAVALRY, SIR, SOMEONE WILL HAVE TO RAISE IT. WHEN IS THE LIEUTENANT TO REPORT? TONIGHT, I HOPE, SIR. SECOND MAY GO INTO ACTION TOMORROW. I CAN PROMISE YOU IT WILL, MY BOY. IT'S IMPOSSIBLE. THERE ISN'T A HORSE TO BE HAD IN WASHINGTON AT ANY PRICE, SIR. IF THERE IS NO HORSE, MAKE THE ORDER TO REPORT AT THE OFFICER'S FIRST ABILITY. VERY WELL, SIR. SORRY TO DISAPPOINT YOU, CUSTER, BUT YOU'LL SEE ACTION SOON ENOUGH. GOOD LUCK. THANK YOU, SIR. THIS IS GENERAL TAIPE'S HORSE. GIVE HIM MY COMPLIMENTS. AND GET OUT OF MY WAY, CORPORAL! OH, CUSTER, SIR. SECOND LIEUTENANT REPORTING FOR DUTY. OH, GLAD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. THANK YOU, SIR. MR. CUSTER, GENTLEMEN. HELLO. PLEASED TO MEET YOU, GENTLEMEN. HAVE A DRINK, SIR. THANK YOU. HERE'S TO BLOODY WAR AND QUICK PROMOTION. YOU BET! A FELLOW OUGHT TO COME OUT OF THIS A MAJOR AT LEAST. YOU'RE QUITE AN OPTIMIST, AREN'T YOU? NO, SIR, JUST FEEL LUCKY. IT'LL TAKE MORE THAN LUCK WITH YOUR GRADES IN TACTICS. WELL, HELLO, SHARP. YOU KNOW EACH OTHER? YES. GENERAL BLOWHARD AND I WERE AT THE ACADEMY TOGETHER. SURE, THAT'S RIGHT, SIR. NOW, GENTLEMEN, THERE'S A FACE I ALWAYS LIKE TO SHAKE HANDS WITH. [LAUGHING] WHOA, BOY. BETTER BE A LITTLE CIRCUMSPECT WITH YOUR SQUADRON COMMANDER. HE HAD. YOU MAY HAVE BUFFALOED YOUR WAY THROUGH WEST POINT, CUSTER, BUT YOU'LL TOE THE MARK HERE. ATTENTION! ALL RIGHT, GENTLEMEN, AS YOU WERE. MR. CUSTER, SIR, JUST REPORTED. WELL, MR. CUSTER, YOU ARRIVED AT AN OPPORTUNE MOMENT. WE'RE MOVING ON MANASSAS JUNCTION, ATTACKING AT 4 A.M. 4 A.M.? GOOD! WE'LL HAVE THEM ON THE RUN BY 4 P.M.

WELL, I GUESS WE CAN'T GRUDGE YOU A COUPLE OF WEEKS IN THE HOSPITAL AND A CHANCE TO GO HOME. GOOD LUCK! NOW THIS HAND. OHH. LADIES, PLEASE, PLEASE. ISN'T THAT ENOUGH? FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE ONLY HAD 30 NURSES TO TAKE CARE OF AN ENTIRE ARMY, AND IT TAKES 4 OF YOU TO GIVE ME A BATH. BUT, LIEUTENANT, WE ONLY WANT YOU TO LOOK YOUR BEST WHEN YOU GET YOUR MEDAL. I DON'T WANT A MEDAL. I JUST WANT A BEEFSTEAK AND A BOTTLE OF BOURBON. OH. ATTENTION! AT EASE. HELLO, CUSTER. HOW ARE YOU, MY BOY? OH, TERRIBLE, SIR, TERRIBLE. I GET GROOMED AND CURRIED BY SQUADS OF THESE NICE LADIES 8 HOURS A DAY, SIR. THAT'S ONE OF THE HORRORS OF WAR, MY BOY. NEVER MIND. YOU'LL BE OUT OF HERE BEFORE LONG. MR. CUSTER, WHEN AN OFFICER DELIBERATELY DISOBEYS ORDERS IN ACTION, THERE CAN BE BUT ONE OF 2 CONSEQUENCES: A FIRING SQUAD OR A MEDAL. YOU SEEM TO HAVE DRAWN THE MEDAL...THIS TIME. THANK YOU, SIR. THAT KIND OF BALANCES ME UP. OUNCE OF LEAD IN MY RIGHT SHOULDER, AN OUNCE OF SILVER ON MY LEFT. NOW, IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE YOU NEED? YES, THERE IS JUST ONE THING, SIR. WHAT'S THAT? A LETTER OF INTRODUCTION. TO WHOM? TO A MR. BACON, SIR, OF MONROE. I UNDERSTAND HE'S AN ACQUAINTANCE OF YOURS. YES, HE IS. HE... BUT YOU'RE FROM MONROE. YOU OUGHT TO KNOW MR. BACON YOURSELF. WELL, I'M NOT FROM HIS SIDE OF TOWN, SIR. OHH, I SEE. ALL RIGHT, MY BOY. I'LL WRITE THAT LETTER BEFORE I LEAVE. THANK YOU, SIR. OH, I DON'T SUPPOSE YOU HAPPEN TO KNOW THAT MR. BACON IS THE FATHER OF A VERY PRETTY YOUNG WOMAN? OH, IS THAT SO? OH, AHEM. WELL, TAKE CARE OF THAT SHOULDER. GOOD LUCK, MY BOY. THANK YOU, SIR. SQUAD, AT EASE.

IF YOU'D CARE TO WAIT FOR MY FATHER, I'LL SHOW YOU INTO THE DRAWING ROOM. BUT, MISS BACON... IT WAS REALLY YOU I CAME TO SEE. BUT WHY? BECAUSE, MA'AM... I CAN'T IMAGINE ANYTHING WORSE, MA'AM, THAN WALKING THROUGH LIFE WITHOUT YOU. NOW DON'T PROPOSE YOU COME STROLLING BY HERE AT 9:00 AND FIND ME SITTING ON THE PORCH AGAIN. I'M SORRY, MA'AM. WON'T YOU FORGIVE ME? IT REALLY WASN'T MY FAULT. AND I'M NOT REALLY ANGRY. I JUST THOUGHT I SHOULD PRETEND TO BE. I KNEW WHEN YOU DIDN'T COME BACK THAT YOU HAD A GOOD REASON. OH, YES. YOU SEE, I HAD TO REPORT TO WASHINGTON, AND I BARELY HAD TIME TO CATCH THE TRAIN. AND A TRAIN WON'T WAIT, BUT A WOMAN WILL. THANK YOU, MA'AM. I WAS HOPING YOU'D SAY THAT, MA'AM. TELL ME, UH... HAVE YOU ALWAYS LIVED IN THIS BIG HOUSE? YES. WHY? OH, NOTHING, EXCEPT I REMEMBER IT WELL. I USED TO RIDE BY HERE OFTEN WHEN I WAS A LITTLE FELLOW ON MY WAY TO GO SWIMMING. I REMEMBER THERE WAS A SASSY LITTLE BRAT OF A GIRL WHO USED TO HANG ON THE GATE OUTSIDE AND STICK HER TONGUE OUT AT ME. I THINK I PULLED HER PIGTAILS FOR HER ONCE. WAS IT YOU WHO PULLED MY PIGTAILS? WAS IT YOU WHO OWNED THEM? OH, DEAR. WHAT IS IT? I DON'T SEE HOW I CAN SMELL THOSE ONIONS ALL THE WAY FROM THE KITCHEN, BUT... ONIONS? ONIONS? THAT'S FUNNY. I DON'T SMELL THEM. DON'T YOU LIKE ONIONS? OH, I--I LOVE THEM! I JUST THOUGHT THAT MAYBE YOU DIDN'T LIKE THEM. OH, NO. NO, I'M VERY FOND OF THEM. UH, CALLIE, WILL YOU GO INTO THE KITCHEN, PLEASE, AND BRING US BACK SOME OF THOSE NICE YOUNG GREEN SPRING ONIONS? ONIONS? YES, CALLIE, ONIONS. YOU KNOW I SIMPLY LOVE THEM. I KNOWS WHAT YOU LOVE, HONEY. IT AIN'T ONIONS. OH...PARDON ME. I DIDN'T MEAN TO TOUCH YOUR HAND. IT'S CERTAINLY A PLEASURE, MA'AM, TO FIND SOMEBODY WHO APPRECIATES ONIONS THE WAY YOU DO.

SO I SAID TO THE GENERAL, "ALL I WANT, SIR, IS 2 THINGS: A WEEK'S LEAVE AND A LETTER OF INTRODUCTION TO YOUR FATHER." NOW... WHEN YOU SEE FATHER, ALL YOU HAVE TO DO... IS SAY TO HIM, "MAY I COME BACK TONIGHT AND CALL ON LIBBY?" NO, YOU BETTER SAY "MISS BACON" AT FIRST. YES, THAT'D BE BETTER. AND WHATEVER YOU DO, DON'T BE AFRAID OF HIM. AFRAID? YOU'RE TALKING TO A SOLDIER, MA'AM. WHY, YOU'S BACK EARLY, MISTER B. YES, I AM. OH, HERE COMES FATHER NOW. HE'S REALLY A DARLING, THOUGH HE LOOKS SEVERE, SO--SO JUST SPEAK UP. I WILL, MA'AM.

HOW DID THIS FELLOW GET INTO MY HOUSE?! WHY, FATHER, HE HAS A LETTER FROM UNCLE PHIL. SO I'M A FAT LITTLE PIPSQUEAK, AM I? I'M A SANCTIMONIOUS OLD SKINFLINT, AM I? BUT, FATHER-- YOU HOLD YOUR TONGUE, LIBBY! HOW DARE YOU COME FROM THAT DEN OF INIQUITY, THAT HAUNT OF DEBAUCHERY, TO POLLUTE THE AIR OF A GENTLEMAN'S HOME! I'M SORRY, SIR, BUT IF YOU'LL ALLOW ME TO EXPLAIN, I-- THERE CAN BE NO EXPLANATION FOR YOUR ROWDY, INSULTING CONDUCT! CERTAINLY NONE THAT'S FIT FOR THE EARS OF MY INNOCENT DAUGHTER!

HE CAN'T DO THAT TO HER. THAT'S WHAT SHE YELLED WHILE HE TURNED THAT LOCK. THEY HAD A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION ABOUT YOU. NOW SHE'S UPSTAIRS WITH HER OPINION, AND HE'S DOWNSTAIRS WITH HIS. CAN YA CLIMB? UP THERE? SURE. BUT WAIT A MINUTE. I DON'T WANT TO CAUSE HER ANY MORE TROUBLE. WE BETTER ARRANGE A SIGNAL IN CASE HE COMES OUT. I CAN HOOT LIKE AN OWL. YOU CAN? HOO HOO! OH, THAT'S FINE. GEORGE.

HIS PATROLS ARE NEAR GETTYSBURG. NEAR GETTYSBURG! THIS MEANS A RECONCENTRATION. COME WITH ME, GENTLEMEN. WILL YOU SIGN THIS ORDER, SIR? COME, TAIPE. YES, SIR. GETTYSBURG. WHERE THE DEUCE IS GETTYSBURG? THIS IS YOUR TENT, LIEUTENANT. I'LL UNPACK YOUR KIT. YOU'LL FIND THE OFFICERS' MESS AT THE END OF THE ROAD, SIR. EXCUSE ME, LIEUTENANT. I REPRESENT GEORGE STRAITH, LIMITED, MILITARY TAILORS. WE HAVE THE HONOR TO SERVE GENERAL GRANT, GENERAL SHERMAN, GENERAL SCOTT. HAVE YOU ANY REQUIREMENTS: GREAT COAT? BRITCHES? NO, THANKS. WE CAN CUT A FINE TUNIC FOR A FIGURE LIKE YOURS. THERE'S ANY IDEAS THAT YOU HAVE OF YOUR OWN, WE'D BE ONLY TOO GLAD TO INCORPORATE THEM. NO, THANKS, I DON'T NEED ANY. THERE'S A NEW SHELL JACKET THAT'S BEING ADMIRED, PARTICULARLY BY THE LADIES. WHY DON'T YOU SHUT UP AND LEAVE ME ALONE? I CAN SEE YOU'RE OUT OF SORTS, LIEUTENANT. BUT IF YOU'D-- SHUT UP AND GET OUT! WELCOME BACK, GENERAL. HELLO, GENERAL. GENERAL? I'LL HAVE YOU KNOW, GENTLEMEN, I'M IN NO MOOD FOR HUMOR. GOOD AFTERNOON, GENERAL. ORDERLY, I'D LIKE A LITTLE COFFEE, PLEASE. CONGRATULATIONS, GENERAL. NOW, THAT'S ENOUGH OF THIS FOOLING. THE NEXT MAN WHO CALLS ME GENERAL IS GOING TO FIND OUT THERE'S A LIMIT TO-- FOR GENERAL CUSTER. [LAUGHTER] SHARP, I'LL TAKE THIS FROM ANYONE BUT YOU. NOW WAIT A MINUTE. WE'RE NOT BEING FUNNY. THE LORD KNOWS HOW OR WHY, BUT YOU REALLY ARE A GENERAL. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? IT'S IN ORDERS, AND HERE'S A LETTER FROM HEADQUARTERS ADDRESSED TO BRIGADIER GENERAL GEORGE ARMSTRONG CUSTER. IS THIS SOMEONE'S IDEA OF A JOKE? THERE ARE NO JOKES IN ORDERS. WELL, THIS MAKES LESS SENSE TO ME THAN IT DOES TO YOU. THERE MUST BE SOME MISTAKE. THEY DON'T MAKE GENERALS OUT OF SHAVE-TAILS. I'D ASK FOR VERIFICATION IF I WERE YOU. WELL, YOU DON'T HAPPEN TO BE ME, SHARP. IF THERE ARE 4 REGIMENTS OF CAVALRY WAITING FOR A GENERAL NAMED CUSTER, THEN THEY'VE GOT HIM. HEY! OH, HEY! TAILOR! HEY! TAILOR! COME HERE! [LAUGHTER] YESTERDAY THERE WAS HEAVY FIGHTING ABOUT 20 MILES FROM HERE. NOW, OUR ARMY HAS BEEN DRIVEN OUT OF GETTYSBURG AND NOW OCCUPIES A RIDGE BELOW THE TOWN. THE BRIGADE'S ORDERS ARE TO CONCENTRATE BELOW THIS HILL, MARKED "BIG ROUND TOP" ON THE MAP. THAT MEANS JEB STUART'S MOVING TO FLANK US FROM THE SOUTH. UNDOUBTEDLY. AS SENIOR COLONEL, I'LL ASSUME COMMAND IF THIS NEW BRIGADIER HASN'T ARRIVED BY THE TIME WE MOVE. JUST WHO THIS CUSTER IS AND WHY HE'S NOT HERE YET I DON'T PROFESS TO KNOW. Orderly: TURN OUT THE GUARD! COMMANDING OFFICER! WE'LL GET A CHANCE TO SEE WHAT HE LOOKS LIKE NOW. JUDAS PRIEST, WHAT'S THAT? HE'S GOT MORE GOLD BRAID ON HIM THAN A FRENCH ADMIRAL. GENTLEMEN, WE MIGHT AS WELL REACH AN UNDERSTANDING AT FIRST SIGHT. AFTER SEEING YOUR COLUMNS AND YOUR TRANSPORTS, I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THAT THIS BRIGADE IS THROUGH WITH INEFFICIENCY AS OF TODAY. IT'S GOING TO LEARN THE MEANING OF SMARTNESS AND THAT AN ORDER IS SOMETHING TO BE OBEYED. DO I MAKE MYSELF CLEAR? YES, SIR. WE'RE READY TO MOVE, SIR. BRIGADE'S ORDERED TO CONCENTRATE ON ROUND TOP, JUST SOUTH OF GETTYSBURG. [GUNFIRE] WHAT'S THAT? PROBABLY SOME ENEMY PATROL RAIDING THE SUPPLY COLUMN. LEE'S IN GETTYSBURG, AND STUART'S CAVALRY'S IN THE SOUTH. REJOIN YOUR UNITS, GENTLEMEN. BE PREPARED TO MOVE IN 10 MINUTES WITH COLUMNS HEADED EAST. EAST? WHAT? BUT THE ORDERS, SIR. TO THE DEVIL WITH THE ORDERS! WE'LL RIDE TO THE SOUND OF THE GUNS. THINGS LOOK BETTER NOW WITH CEMETERY BACK IN OUR HANDS AND SICKLES' FRONT RESTORED, BUT, UH... YESTERDAY WE LOST 20,000 MEN. PICKETT'S MOVED UP TO REINFORCE LONGSTREET. THEY'RE MASSING TO ATTACK OUR CENTER. I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT THE CENTER, TAIPE. I'M WORRIED ABOUT JEB STUART. WHY HASN'T HE TRIED TO TURN THE FLANK AT ROUND TOP? BECAUSE HE KNOWS OUR CAVALRY'S CONCENTRATED THERE TO STOP HIM. WHEN DID OUR CAVALRY EVER STOP JEB STUART? IF HE TURNS US, THE POSITION'S LOST. WASHINGTON AND BALTIMORE WILL FALL. HANOVER? STUART! STUART'S CORPS AT HANOVER? IT'S A MISTAKE! GET VERIFICATION AT ONCE! IT HAS BEEN VERIFIED, SIR. HE'S ON OUR REAR. WE'RE TRAPPED. ALL THAT STANDS BETWEEN US AND TOTAL DISASTER IS THE MICHIGAN BRIGADE, A HANDFUL OF VOLUNTEERS. BUT THE MICHIGAN BRIGADE'S BEEN ORDERED TO ROUND TOP, SIR! IT'S ON ITS WAY NOW. THEN STOP IT, TAIPE! STOP IT! TELL IT TO HOLD ITS GROUND TO THE LAST MAN. WHO'S THE BRIGADIER? WHY, UH-- WHO IS HE, TAIPE?! WHY, UH... CORPORAL SMITH. CORPORAL SMITH. ALL RIGHT. AS YOU WERE. WHO'S THE NEW COMMANDER OF THE MICHIGAN CAVALRY? GENERAL CUSTER, SIR. GENERAL CUSTER, SIR. CUSTER? WHAT CUSTER'S THAT? GEORGE ARMSTRONG CUSTER. HERE'S A COPY OF THE ORDER. WHAT IS THIS? HOW DID THIS HAPPEN? WELL, WHO IS HE? HEAVEN HELP US, SIR.

[SOUNDING CHARGE] WE'RE TAKING IMMEDIATE ACTION AS TO CUSTER, SIR. THIS CUSTER OF YOURS IS INSUBORDINATE, ALL RIGHT. THANK GOD FOR IT. HE'S NOT MARCHING ON ROUND TOP. HE'S ATTACKING STUART AT HANOVER! ATTACKING?! ATTACKING A WHOLE CORPS? INSTEAD OF TRYING TO HOLD HIS GROUND, THE MAD FOOL'S ATTACKING! THAT WAS A GALLANT CHARGE, MEN, EVEN IF IT FAILED. SERGEANT, SEE THAT THE WOUNDED ARE TAKEN CARE OF. SENIOR COLONEL PRESENTS HIS COMPLIMENTS, SIR. THE 5th AND 6th MICHIGAN ARE FORMED FOR ATTACK. ARE THERE ANY ORDERS? WE'LL TRY MORE WEIGHT THIS TIME.

GENERAL... ABOUT THIS CUSTER MATTER... WHAT DO YOU PROPOSE TO DO? DO? DO, TAIPE? OH, YES. CUSTER. I INTEND TO WALK ACROSS THE STREET AND BUY MYSELF A DOUBLE PORTION OF CREAMED BERMUDA ONIONS. [LAUGHTER] [MARCHING BAND PLAYING] HELLO, CHARLES, GOOD TO SEE YOU. WELCOME. WELCOME. WELCOME HOME, GENERAL. WELCOME HOME. WE'RE PROUD OF YOU, SIR, AND PROUD TO KNOW THAT ONE OF OUR TOWNSMEN HAS WON SUCH GLORY. YOU'RE A CREDIT TO MONROE, SIR, AND TO THE UNITED STATES ARMY. THANK YOU, SIR. NOW, THE PARADE WILL FORM ON ELM STREET. WE WILL TURN INTO "D" STREET, CROSS THE PARKWAY, AND THEN MARCH RIGHT UP MAIN STREET. KINDLY STAY ON THE SIDEWALKS. THOSE OF YOU WHO WISH TO MARCH WITH US...

I BROUGHT MY REGIMENTAL CHAPLAIN, AND GENERAL SHERIDAN HIMSELF IS GONNA BE BEST MAN, SIR-- THAT IS, OF COURSE, WITH YOUR PERMISSION. MY PERMISSION? WELL, NOW, UH, OF COURSE, GENERAL, I SHALL BE HONORED TO GIVE IT, BUT YOU MUSTN'T BE TOO IMPETUOUS. AFTER ALL, THERE'S THE ANNOUNCEMENT, THE ARRANGEMENT. IF YOU GET MARRIED TODAY, YOU CAN'T HAVE ANY OF THESE. BUT I SHALL HAVE GENERAL GEORGE ARMSTRONG CUSTER, AND HE'S WHAT I STARTED OUT TO GET. LIBBY, THIS IS POSITIVELY UNMAIDENLY. AFTER TODAY, THAT WON'T MATTER. [ORGAN PLAYS THE WEDDING MARCH] WHERE DID MISS LIBBY GET HERSELF SUCH A FINE HANDSOME MAN? WHY, CHILD, I FOUND HIM IN A TEACUP. THERE'S 2 GENTLEMEN TO SEE GENERAL CUSTER, MISS LIBBY, AND THEY CLAIM THEIR NAME'S SHARP. THANK YOU, JANE. YOU MUST LET CALLIE ATTEND TO THE CALLERS. YES, MA'AM. CALLIE, HAS GENERAL CUSTER RETURNED HOME YET? NO, MA'AM, NOT SINCE HE LEFT AT HIS USUAL TIME THIS MORNING. THEN I'LL RECEIVE THE CALLERS IN HERE. TELL THEM THE GENERAL'S EXPECTED HOME SOON. YES, MA'AM. I'LL TELL 'EM HE'S DOWNTOWN TAKING CARE OF SOME BUSINESS. I DON'T HOLD WITH YOU, MAJOR SMITH. I DON'T HOLD WITH YOU AT ALL, SIR. MMM. AHH! IF LEE HAD CONCENTRATED HIS ARTILLERY AND SUCCEEDED IN, UH... ENFILADING ROUND TOP, WE WOULD HAVE BEEN LICKED TO DEATH AT GETTYSBURG. WHY DIDN'T HE, GENERAL? WELL, WHO KNOWS? EVERY GREAT SOLDIER HAS A BAD DAY, AND PERHAPS IT WAS LEE'S TURN AT GETTYSBURG. UH-OH. WELL...HE WHO DRINKS AND RUNS AWAY LIVES TO DRINK ANOTHER DAY. THANK YOU, JOE. STEP UP TO THE BAR, BOYS. MY PLEASURE. SET 'EM UP, JOE. MR. SHARP, THE MONEY DOESN'T MATTER, BUT WHAT YOU OFFER IS THE ANSWER TO A PRAYER. I'D ALMOST GIVEN UP HOPE OF GEORGE'S EVER FINDING ANYTHING SUITED TO HIM IN CIVIL LIFE. WE KNOW OF NO ONE ELSE SO WELL-QUALIFIED, MRS. CUSTER. OH! SO YOU'RE HERE AT LAST. I'M AFRAID I'VE BEEN BORING THESE GENTLEMEN DREADFULLY. WELL, THEY'LL GET NO SYMPATHY FROM ME, DARLING. MADAM, UNTIL THIS AFTERNOON, I'D ENVIED GENERAL CUSTER ONLY HIS FAME. OH, MR. SHARP. BUT YOU'LL EXCUSE ME. I--I HAVE SOME FLOWERS I MUST CUT IN THE GARDEN. I HOPE YOU'LL FORGIVE THIS INTRUSION, CUSTER. THE NORTH AND THE SOUTH HAVE FORGOTTEN THEIR DIFFICULTIES, SO...I HOPE WE CAN FORGET OURS. MAY I PRESENT MY FATHER WILLIAM SHARP. GENERAL CUSTER. HOW DO YOU DO, SIR? HOW DO YOU DO? OH, DO YOU KNOW, SIR, I WAS JOKING WITH THE ADJUTANT GENERAL ABOUT YOU LAST WEEK. OH. TAIPE? YES, TAIPE. YOU STOLE HIS HORSE ON ONE OCCASION, IT SEEMS. THAT'S RIGHT. A FINE ANIMAL. MUCH TOO GOOD FOR HIM. DRINK? YES. THANK YOU. WE'VE COME FROM WASHINGTON ESPECIALLY TO SEE YOU, GENERAL. INDEED? WHY? BECAUSE THERE'S MONEY IN FAME THESE DAYS. WE'VE COME TO OFFER YOU THE PRESIDENCY OF THE WESTERN RAILROAD LAND AND TRADING COMPANY AT A SALARY OF $10,000 A YEAR. IT'S A CORPORATION I ORGANIZED FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE DAKOTA TERRITORIES. BUT, UH, WHAT USE COULD I BE TO A CONCERN OF THAT KIND? I'M A SOLDIER. WELL, YOU'RE A NATIONAL HERO, CUSTER. YOUR NAME WOULD MAKE IT EASY FOR US TO GET, UH, GOVERNMENT CONCESSIONS, SUCH AS TRADING MONOPOLIES AT ARMY POSTS. AND, OF COURSE, IT WOULD GO FAR IN SELLING STOCK TO THE PUBLIC. MY NAME? I SEE. WHAT'S THIS STOCK WORTH? NOTHING, NATURALLY, UNTIL IT BEGINS TO EARN DIVIDENDS. THEN I'M NOT INTERESTED. MY NAME STANDS FOR SOMETHING, AND I'LL NOT GAMBLE WHAT IT MEANS ON THE SUCCESS OR FAILURE OF ANY BUSINESS VENTURE. NOT INTERESTED. GENERAL, I'M AFRAID YOU'VE AN INCLINATION TO BE A...ROMANTIC FOOL. AN ADMIRABLE ONE, NO DOUBT, BUT, UH, NONETHELESS A FOOL. CAN A MAN OF YOUR DISTINCTION BEAR THE THOUGHT OF LIVING OFF HIS WIFE'S ESTATE? I KNOW THE THOUGHT HASN'T OCCURRED TO YOU, GENERAL, BUT-- IT'S OCCURRED TO ME. WE'RE OFFERING YOU A CHANCE TO SERVE THE NATION AS MUCH AS ON THE BATTLEFIELD. THE COMPANY WILL BRING CIVILIZATION TO AN ENORMOUS WASTE OF TERRITORY, WHICH IS, AT PRESENT, IN THE HANDS OF BLOODTHIRSTY SAVAGES. WHY, IT'S AS FINE A-- THAT'S ENOUGH! I'LL GAMBLE. I'LL GAMBLE WITH ANYTHING-- MY MONEY, MY SWORD, MY LIFE, IF NECESSARY-- BUT THERE'S ONE THING I WON'T GAMBLE WITH, AND THAT'S MY GOOD NAME. GOOD DAY, GENTLEMEN! YOU'RE EXCITED, GENERAL. NOW-- IT'S NOT AN OFFER THAT COMES TWICE-- NO. ONCE IS ENOUGH. QUITE ENOUGH. GOOD DAY, GENTLEMEN. WHAT DID THE SHARPS WANT OF YOU, GEORGE? ONLY MY NAME, FOR A STOCK PROMOTION. ONLY YOUR NAME? YES. THEY WANTED TO HIRE IT FOR $10,000 A YEAR. IT'S A LOT OF MONEY, BUT WE'VE 5 DOGS AND 11 HORSES NOW. WHAT COULD WE HAVE DONE WITH IT? WELL, THINK OF ALL THE BAGS OF ONIONS WE COULD HAVE BOUGHT. TO KEEP ME AWAY FROM YOU, I SUPPOSE. AREN'T YOU HAPPY HERE, MR. CUSTER? MRS. CUSTER...I'VE NEVER BEEN SO HAPPY IN MY LIFE. Orderly: MRS. CUSTER, SIR. GENERAL SHERIDAN SHOULD HAVE WARNED ME, MA'AM. OH, I THOUGHT UNCLE PHIL HAD ADVISED YOU THAT-- OH, HE ADVISED ME OF YOUR COMING, BUT HE DIDN'T WARN ME THAT I WOULD MEET THE MOST BEAUTIFUL GIRL I EVER LAID EYES ON. OH! YOU'RE VERY KIND, GENERAL SCOTT, AND VERY EMBARRASSING. UPON MY SOUL, MA'AM, YOU MAKE ME REGRET THIS UNCHIVALROUS AGE. IF EVER A LADY'S HAND DESERVED TO BE SALUTED, IT IS CERTAINLY YOURS. FORGIVE AN OLD SOLDIER. IT WAS A CUSTOM IN HIS YOUTH. DID UNCLE PHIL TELL YOU THE PURPOSE OF MY COMING, GENERAL SCOTT? NO. HE SAID IT WAS A MATTER FOR MY DECISION, IN ANY EVENT. IT'S ABOUT MY HUSBAND. OF COURSE. CUSTER. I SHOULD HAVE ASKED YOU, HOW IS THE LUCKY DOG? NOT SO LUCKY, I'M AFRAID. OH, WELL, THAT'S BAD. IS HE IN ILL HEALTH? NOT EXACTLY, GENERAL SCOTT, BUT INACTIVITY IS DOING SOMETHING TO HIM, UNDERMINING HIM. GEORGE WILL NEVER BE HIMSELF OUT OF THE ARMY. HE'S NOT HAPPY... EVEN THOUGH HE PRETENDS TO BE. OH, GENERAL SCOTT, CAN'T YOU PUT HIM BACK INTO ACTIVE SERVICE? MY DEAR, I KNOW WHAT EATS A MAN WHO HAS ENDURED THE TENSION OF WAR FOR YEARS. IT'S LIKE A DRUG, THAT TENSION. A MAN CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT IT. OH, PLEASE, GENERAL SCOTT. PLEASE. MRS. CUSTER, I'M BOUND BY THE RULE OF SENIORITY IN MAKING APPOINTMENTS, THE RULE OF THE ARMY. OH! OH, COME, COME, MY CHILD. YOU'RE UNDULY DISTRESSED ABOUT GEORGE. TIME IS A HEALER. TIME WILL CURE HIM. NO, NO. IT WILL DESTROY HIM. THERE'S SOMETHING YOU HAVEN'T TOLD ME. ISN'T THERE? IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR ME TO TELL YOU THIS, BUT I'M AFRAID, SO AFRAID. HE'S BEEN DRINKING, SO MUCH...MUCH MORE THAN HE KNOWS. OH... I SEE. I CAN'T BEAR TO THINK OF HIM IN DEGRADATION. OH, GENERAL SCOTT, YOU'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING TO SAVE HIM. WE OWE HIM SO MUCH. ALL OF US. THERE, THERE, MY DEAR. YOU'RE QUITE RIGHT. WE DO OWE HIM A LOT. OH... George: YES, SIR, THAT IS A HANDSOME PIECE. Libby: UNCLE PHIL WAS JUST SENDING THE WATCH TO YOU WHEN I POPPED IN ON HIM. THE BRIGADE ASKED HIM TO CHOOSE IT. HUH. THOSE ARE GREAT BOYS. GREAT DAYS. AND THE LITTLE MINIATURE OF YOU IS BEAUTIFUL. THE CHAIN BELONGED TO FATHER. I ALWAYS WANTED YOU TO HAVE IT. IT'S BEAUTIFUL. HERE'S YOUR MORNIN' MAIL, GENERAL. THANK YOU. WELL, THAT MUST HAVE BEEN A DULL TRIP, DARLING. IT WASN'T SO DULL. I HAD A LOT OF SHOPPING TO DO, YOU KNOW, AND, OF COURSE, IT WAS WONDERFUL TO SEE UNCLE PHIL AGAIN. I MISSED YOU. HOW DO YOU LIKE YOUR EGGS THIS MORNIN', GENERAL, BOILED OR FRIED? WHAT? I SAID HOW DO YOU LIKE YOUR EGGS, BOILED OR FRIED? EGGS?! SURE! EGGS! BOILED AND FRIED! AND SCRAMBLED AND POACHED AND RUBBED INTO YOUR HAIR! THE MAN'S PLUMB CRAZY! LIBBY! LIBBY, LOOK! I'M ON THE ACTIVE LIST AGAIN, AS A LIEUTENANT COLONEL TO RAISE A REGIMENT OF CAVALRY AT FORT LINCOLN. WHY, IT EVEN SAYS THEY PASSED UP 50 SENIOR OFFICERS TO GIVE ME THE JOB! OH, DARLING, HOW WONDERFUL! OH, I'M SO GLAD FOR YOU! BUT WHERE'S FORT LINCOLN? FORT LINCOLN... IN THE DAKOTA TERRITORY, I THINK. WAIT A MINUTE! I'LL GET THE MAP! SIT DOWN. SIT DOWN. CALLIE...GENERAL CUSTER AND I ARE GOING AWAY, SO YOU MUST PACK THOSE THINGS I MENTIONED THIS MORNING. BUT, MISS LIBBY, WHAT ABOUT ALL YOUR LOVELY THINGS: YOUR CHINA, YOUR SILVER, AND ALL YOUR PRETTY CLOTHES? WELL, I'LL HAVE TO LEAVE THOSE BEHIND. CALLIE... I'LL HAVE TO LEAVE YOU, TOO. BUT, MISS LIBBY, AIN'T Y'ALL GONNA HAVE NOBODY TO FIX FOR YOU WHILE YOU'RE AWAY UP THERE? OH, I'LL GET ALONG, CALLIE. WHY, IT'S RIDICULOUS, MISS LIBBY, GIVIN' UP YOUR HOME AND YOUR WHOLE LIFE. I SURE HOPES THE GENERAL APPRECIATES WHAT YOU'RE DOIN' FOR HIM. FORT LINCOLN... FORT LINCOLN... FORT LINCOLN-- HERE IT IS! SEE? LOOK. YOU GO BY RAIL TO BISMARCK... AND FROM THEN ON, BY WAGON TRAIL. MOVE OVER THERE, SWEETHEART, BEFORE I CUT THE REST OF YOUR TAIL OFF. I BEG YOUR PARDON! I SAID, MOVE OVER, YOU DIRTY ETHIOPIAN SON OF A BLUE-BELLIED MOHAWK! YOU MEAN THE HORSE. STOP THAT, YOU ORNERY, OWL-FACED FLOOZY, OR I'LL SPIT IN YOUR EAR! [SPITS] YOU MADE IT! YEAH. SHUCKS, THAT AIN'T NOTHING. I CAN SPIT IN A PRAIRIE DOG'S EYE AT 50 FEET. AIN'T NOBODY IN THESE PARTS CAN BEAT CALIFORNIA JOE WHEN IT--WHEN IT COMES TO SPITTING. AND WHO'S CALIFORNIA JOE? WHO? HA HA HA HA! THAT'S ME! OH! I SEE. YOU COME FROM CALIFORNIA. NO, MA'AM. NO. NO. WELL, THEN WHY DO THEY CALL YOU CALIFORNIA JOE? WHY, I GUESS 'CAUSE I-- [SPITS] 'CAUSE I'VE BEEN AIMING THERE FOR 27 YEARS, AND IT LOOKS LIKE I'LL BE AIMING THERE FOR 27 MORE YEARS, WITH THESE INDIANS ON THE WARPATH HERE AGAIN. ARE WE LIKELY TO SEE ANY TODAY? NO MORE LIKELY THAN YOU ARE TO SEE THEM SOLDIERS IN THEIR FANCY PANTS FROM THE FORT. WELL, HOW'S OLD CALIFORNIA? HE TAUGHT YA HOW TO CHEW TOBACCO YET? NO, BUT HE'S BEEN TEACHING ME ABOUT INDIANS, AND LET ME TELL YOU, HE HAS NO RESPECT FOR SOLDIERS, SIR. OH, HE HASN'T, EH? WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH HIM? EVERYTHING THEY DON'T KNOW IS ABOUT INDIANS. INDIANS IS TOO IGNORANT TO FIGHT RIGHT. THEY--THEY FIGHT WRONG EVERY TIME. THAT'S WHY THE SOLDIERS ALWAYS GET LICKED. TO LICK A INDIAN, YOU GOTTA-- YA GOTTA FIGHT 'EM LIKE A INDIAN. THERE MIGHT BE SOMETHING TO THAT. HOW WOULD YOU LIKE A JOB WITH MY OUTFIT? WHAT--ME? HA HA! BE A SOLDIER AND WEAR THEM FANCY PANTS AND...WASH MY EARS WITH STORE SOAP AND SLEEP IN A BED? HA HA HA HA! NO...SIR! MY BUSINESS IS SHOOTING, NOT SALUTING. I CAN'T SALUTE, ANYWAY. I GOT--I GOT RHEUMATISM IN MY SALUTING ARM. I-- WELL! I'M A DIRTY--LOOK! WHAT'S THE MATTER? WHAT DO YOU SEE? SKIN YOUR EYEBALLS, SON! THERE'S A REDSKIN OVER ON THAT ROCK YONDER! INDIANS? ONE, MAYBE 2! ON YOUR BELLY, MA'AM! [YELLING ORDERS] AFTER THEM, MEN! GEORGE...GEORGE! COME ON! GET OUTTA HERE! NOW... SIGNAL YOUR PEOPLE, DRIVE BACK MY HORSES, OR I'LL HANG YOU AT THE FORT GATE. YOU GIVE WORD... NOT KILL WITH ROPE? I GIVE WORD. NOW SIGNAL. I SPEAK. [SPEAKING NATIVE LANGUAGE] WHY, YOU DIRTY, MOTH-EATEN, COCKEYED SON OF A RAT! IF IT AIN'T OLD CRAZY HORSE, CHIEF OF THE SIOUX. HA HA HA... WHAT A SHIVAREE THERE'S GONNA BE WHEN THEY DRAG YOU INTO FORT LINCOLN ON THE END OF THAT ROPE! OH, WE'LL TAKE HIM IN THERE, LET HIM COOL HIS HEELS FOR 60 DAYS. MAYBE HE'LL BE A GOOD BOY. TIE HIM UP. PUT HIM IN THE WAGON. I TELL YA, SON, WE BETTER VAMOOSE OUTTA HERE QUICK BEFORE THE REST OF 'EM COME BACK TO GET THEIR CHIEF. I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT, JOE. [SPEAKING SIOUX] CALIFORNIA, CALIFORNIA... [SPEAKING SIOUX] WHAT DID SHE SAY? SHE WANTS TO KNOW IF SHE CAN NAME THAT PAPOOSE AFTER ME. OH, HOW CHARMING. TURN OUT THE GUARD. GET RID OF THAT CIGAR. GUARD, TURN OUT! [BUGLE BLOWS] WHOA! LOOK AT THAT GUARD. FILTHY AS A LOT OF MOUNTAIN GOATS. WHY, THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO STAND TO ATTENTION. THEY'RE RECRUITS, SIR. THE REGIMENT'S JUST BEEN MUSTERED IN. WE HAVEN'T A COLONEL YET. OH, YES, YOU HAVE. YOU'VE GOT ONE NOW. WHY AREN'T THERE ANY PATROLS OUT? WHAT ARE YOU ALL DOING INSIDE THIS FORT, ANYWAY, HIDING? THIS FORT ISN'T HERE TO PROTECT THE ARMY. THE ARMY'S SUPPOSED TO BE OUTSIDE PROTECTING THE TRAIL. CRAZY HORSE'S SIOUX ARE RAIDING, SIR. WE'VE ORDERS TO HOLE UP. OH, YOU HAVE, HAVE YOU? BRING OUT THAT INDIAN! I'D LIKE YOU TO SEE, MR. WHATEVER YOUR NAME IS, JUST WHAT'S BEEN HOLDING UP A WHOLE REGIMENT OF U.S. CAVALRY. Man: CRAZY HORSE! YEAH! STRING HIM UP! [MEN SHOUTING] BACK, BACK, ALL OF YOU, BACK! OR I'LL TURN HIM LOOSE AND LET HIM CHASE YOU! YOU GIVE WORD, LONG HAIR. SHOOT NOW. NO ROPE. I GIVE WORD, CRAZY HORSE. I KEEP MY WORD. TELL OFF A DETAIL. TAKE HIM TO THE GUARDHOUSE. YES, SIR. YOU 4 MEN, TAKE CHARGE OF THE PRISONER. AND SEE THAT HE'S WELL TREATED. YES, SIR. YOU'LL FIND HEADQUARTERS STRAIGHT AHEAD, SIR. [MEN GRUMBLING] OUT OF THE WAY. CALIFORNIA, WHAT ARE ALL THESE INDIANS DOING INSIDE THE FORT? AHH...THEY'RE TRADIN' FOR RIFLES. RIFLES? LIBBY, YOU BETTER GO ON. I'LL BE WITH YOU IN A FEW MINUTES. CALIFORNIA, TAKE THE WAGONS ON TO MY QUARTERS. SURE. OH, SAY, SON, ABOUT THAT JOININ' THE ARMY, I CALCULATE I COULD CHANGE MY MIND IF I DIDN'T HAVE TO WEAR THEM FANCY PANTS AND-AND NO SALUTIN'! UP, THERE, HOGHEAD. COME ON! AROUND ABOUT. FORWARD. WHERE'S THE OWNER OF THIS PLACE? TELL HIM TO COME OUT. I WANT TO SEE HIM. BOSS... WELL, LOOK WHO'S HERE. YOU. ARE YOU IN CHARGE HERE? YEP. GENERAL MANAGER OF ALL THE COMPANY'S TRADING STORES. YOU TURNED DOWN A GOOD THING, CUSTER. COLONEL CUSTER TO YOU, SHARP. I'M IN COMMAND HERE, AND DON'T YOU EVER FORGET IT. I WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SELLING RIFLES FOR. FOR $75 APIECE. THEY'RE CIVIL WAR SURPLUS WE BOUGHT FROM THE GOVERNMENT. AND YOU'RE SELLING THEM TO INDIANS? WHAT ARE THESE INDIANS DOING INSIDE THE FORT? OH, THEY'RE, UH, FRIENDLIES. FRIENDLIES. I CERTAINLY HOPE YOU'RE RIGHT, SHARP. THESE WINCHESTERS WILL OUTRANGE ANY OF OUR CAVALRY RIFLES, AND YOU KNOW IT. [SCUFFLING] ATTENTION! COMMANDING OFFICER! SERGEANT, THERE'S 2 MEN BRAWLING OUTSIDE. HAVE THEM PUT UNDER ARREST FOR NOT BEING ABLE TO HOLD THEIR LIQUOR. THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE CAVALRYMEN. YES, SIR. AT EASE, MEN. WELL, COLONEL, I HOPE YOU LIKE YOUR RECRUITS. THEY'RE ABOUT THE WORST LOT OF RUSTLERS, GUNMEN, AND OUTCASTS THAT I'VE EVER SEEN. THE SCUM OF THE EARTH. IT SEEMS TO BE YOUR BUSINESS TO MAKE THEM WORSE. NOW, LOOK, SHARP, I WANT THIS BAR CLOSED. I WANT IT CLOSED NOW. THIS BAR IS RUN UNDER A GOVERNMENT FRANCHISE. YOU CAN'T CLOSE IT. SERGEANT... YES, SIR? TURN OUT A SQUAD OF MEN WITH SIDE ARMS. CLOSE THIS PLACE UP. [GRUMBLING] MEN! THIS BAR IS A LAWFUL BUSINESS. THE COMPANY'S GOT ONE IN EVERY ARMY POST. NOW, YOU KNOW YOUR RIGHTS, BOYS. NOBODY CAN TELL YOU HOW TO SPEND YOUR PAY, RIGHT? WAIT A MINUTE, MEN. WAIT A MINUTE. I HAVE TO ADMIT THAT WHAT MR. SHARP SAYS IS PERFECTLY CORRECT. I HAVE NO LEGAL REASON TO CLOSE THIS BAR. NONE WHATSOEVER. AND I WON'T... PROVIDING MR. SHARP DOESN'T MIND BEING TAKEN BY THE SCRUFF OF HIS NECK AND SLUNG CLEAR THROUGH THAT MIRROR EVERY TIME I FIND IT OPEN... COMMENCING ONE MINUTE FROM NOW. CLOSE IT UP. NOW, LISTEN, MEN, I'M NOT DOING THIS TO BE A BLUENOSE. I KNOW IT'S TOUGH ON YOU NOT BEING ABLE TO TAKE A DRINK. IT'S TOUGH ON ME, TOO. HEH, MAYBE IT'S TOUGHER. BUT THE DAY I BREAK DOWN AND TAKE ONE, THAT'S THE DAY THIS BAR'S GOING TO OPEN AGAIN. I DON'T ASK ANY MAN TO STICK TO SOMETHING I CAN'T STICK TO MYSELF, AND THAT'S THE WAY IT'S GONNA BE IN THIS REGIMENT. GUN NO WORK. YOU FIX 'UM. OH, SAFETY CATCH. SEE? HERE. [GUNSHOT] [SHOUTING] [GUNSHOTS] WELL, PARTNER, WHAT'D I TELL YA? THEM DIRTY, LYIN', CRUMMY, FLEA-BITTEN FRIENDLIES SET HIM LOOSE. FRIENDLIES? ANY INDIAN WITH $75 IS A FRIENDLY TO SHARP. SERGEANT! HAVE A STOP PUT IMMEDIATELY TO THAT RIFLE TRADING. I WANT EVERY INDIAN PUT OUTSIDE THIS FORT. VERY WELL, SIR. YOU, HAVE THE TRUMPETER SOUND OFFICERS' CALL. YES, SIR. YOU KNOW, JOE, IN A WAY, I DON'T MIND THAT INDIAN GETTING OFF. HE'S THE ONLY CAVALRYMAN I'VE SEEN AROUND THIS FORT SO FAR, BUT WE'LL PUT A STOP TO THAT. [BUGLE BLOWS] WE'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PROTECTION OF 100,000 SQUARE MILES OF TERRITORY. AND AGAINST US ARE RANGED THOUSANDS OF THE FINEST LIGHT CAVALRY ON EARTH. I FOUND THAT OUT THIS MORNING. IT'S A BIG JOB, GENTLEMEN, AND IT'S GOING TO NEED A FINE REGIMENT. OUR JOB IS TO MAKE THIS THE FINEST REGIMENT THAT THE UNITED STATES EVER SAW. I NEEDN'T TELL MOST OF YOU THAT A REGIMENT IS SOMETHING MORE THAN JUST 600 DISCIPLINED FIGHTING MEN. MEN DIE... BUT A REGIMENT LIVES ON, BECAUSE A REGIMENT HAS AN IMMORTAL SOUL OF ITS OWN. WELL, THE WAY TO BEGIN IS TO FIND IT, TO FIND SOMETHING THAT BELONGS TO US ALONE, SOMETHING TO GIVE US THAT PRIDE IN OURSELVES THAT'LL MAKE MEN ENDURE, AND IF NECESSARY, DIE WITH THEIR BOOTS ON. AS FOR THE REST, IT'S EASY, SINCE IT'S NO MORE THAN HARD WORK, HARD RIDING, AND HARD FIGHTING. THANK YOU, GENTLEMEN. I KNOW I CAN COUNT ON YOU. MAJOR MEYERS, SIR. MAJOR, PLEASURE. MR. COOPER. COOPER. CAPTAIN ELLIOT, SIR. CAPTAIN. CAPTAIN THOMPSON. THOMPSON. BUTLER, SIR. BUTLER! "QUEEN'S OWN" BUTLER. HOW DID YOU GET HERE? BECOME QUITE A BALLY YANKEE, SIR. RODE BEHIND YOU AT HANOVER AND RATHER FANCIED I'D SEE A BIT OF SPORT WITH YOU OUT WEST. WELL, I HOPE YOU DO. DO YOU KNOW THAT YOU'VE HAUNTED ME EVER SINCE THAT TIME I MET YOU AT MONROE? HAUNTED, SIR? YES. I'VE CURSED YOU REGULARLY, EVERY TIME I TRIED TO THINK OF THAT CONFOUNDED SONG. WHAT WAS THE NAME OF IT? OH, UH, GARRYOWEN. GARRYOWEN. COME ALONG HERE. PLAY IT FOR US. EXCUSE ME, GENTLEMEN.

CRAZY HORSE, WAR CHIEF SIOUX, SPEAK WITH LONG HAIR, WAR CHIEF GREAT WHITE FATHER. I LISTEN TO MY BROTHER. MY PEOPLE WANT MAKE PEACE. THEY'VE LOST MANY BRAVES. THEY'RE TIRED OF WAR. THEY WILL GIVE UP THE PLAINS FOREVER. THEY WILL GIVE UP THEIR LODGES BY THE RUNNING STREAMS. THEY WILL GIVE UP THEIR HUNTING GROUNDS WHERE THE BUFFALO GRAZE. THEY WILL GIVE ALL UP... BUT ONE PLACE. SPEAK. WHAT IS THIS PLACE? THEY WILL NOT GIVE UP THE BLACK HILLS, FOR THERE THE SPIRITS OF OUR FATHERS DWELL, AND THERE THE GODS HAVE MADE THEIR TEEPEES. BUT ALL ELSE THAT IS MY PEOPLE WE GIVE UP... BUT BLACK HILLS. I WILL BEAR MY BROTHER'S WORDS TO THE GREAT WHITE FATHER. LET LONG HAIR RETURN WITH WORD OF GREAT WHITE FATHER THAT NO WHITE MAN WILL SET FOOT ON SACRED SOIL, AND CRAZY HORSE AND HIS BROTHERS WILL SMOKE PEACE PIPE FOREVER. IF THE GREAT WHITE FATHER GIVES WORD TO MY BROTHER'S PEOPLE, THEN LONG HAIR AND HIS LONG KNIVES WILL DEFEND BLACK HILLS AGAINST ALL WHITE MEN WHO SEEK TO PROFANE THEM. THAT IS THE WORD OF LONG HAIR. LONG HAIR'S WORD GOOD WORD... BUT THE WORD OF THE GREAT WHITE FATHER IS BROKEN WORD. HEAR ME NOW, LONG HAIR. IF THIS WORD BROKEN NOW, NOT ONLY SIOUX BUT THE CHEYENNE, THE OGLALA, THE MENICONJOU, THE BLACKFEET, THE SANS ARCS, AND EVERY LIVING TRIBE BETWEEN MOUNTAINS AND GREAT WATERS WILL GATHER IN ONE LAST BATTLE. IT WILL BE THE END OF THEMSELVES, THEIR GODS, THE SPIRITS OF THEIR FATHERS, AND OF THEIR ENEMIES. CRAZY HORSE SPOKE. MY BOY, WE'RE HERE BECAUSE THE COMPANY IS FACING BANKRUPTCY ON ACCOUNT OF THIS IDIOTIC TREATY WITH THE SIOUX. YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL ME THAT. IN THE LAST YEAR, I'VE OUTFITTED A HANDFUL OF SETTLERS, AND FROM 20 STORES. THERE'LL BE NO MORE SETTLERS TILL THE RAILROAD'S PUSHED ON, AND THE RAILROAD'S ONLY ROUTE IS THROUGH THE BLACK HILLS. THEY'RE THE GATEWAY TO THE WEST. A FEW THOUSAND SAVAGES HAVE STOPPED THE MARCH OF AMERICAN CIVILIZATION. WHY CAN'T YOU DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT AT WASHINGTON? THAT WAS WHY I BROUGHT INFLUENCE TO HAVE TAIPE APPOINTED TO THIS JOB OF, UH, SPECIAL COMMISSIONER. WHAT IS THE JOB? IT'S TO COORDINATE THE CIVIL AND MILITARY ADMINISTRATION OF ALL INDIAN TERRITORIES. WHILE HE'S ON THE GROUND, WE CAN CONSIDER LOCAL MEANS OF, UH, UNLOCKING THE BLACK HILLS' GATE. WELL, YOU'LL FIND NONE HERE. THE 7th CAVALRY HAS EVERY PASS AND RIVER COMPLETELY COVERED. IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO SNEAK A SINGLE OUTFIT THROUGH, AND I HAVE TO KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. NO DOUBT YOU DO, BUT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SINGLE OUTFITS. SUPPOSE THERE WERE THOUSANDS OF THEM? THOUSANDS? WHAT WOULD BRING THOUSANDS OF OUTFITS TO DAKOTA? GOLD. GOLD? WELL, THERE'S-- THERE'S NO GOLD IN THE BLACK HILLS. WHO CAN SAY WHAT'S TO BE FOUND IN THE BLACK HILLS, HUH? OHH. SAY, IT'D BRING THEM IN IN SWARMS, ALL RIGHT. START A SECOND CALIFORNIA GOLD RUSH. BUT, UH... WHAT ABOUT THE SIOUX? THAT'S WHERE THE COMMISSIONER COMES IN. TREATY OR NO TREATY, WE CANNOT ALLOW THOUSANDS OF AMERICAN CITIZENS TO BE MASSACRED. THE FORCES OF GENERAL CROOK AND GENERAL TERRY WILL MOVE IN BETWEEN THEM AND THE SIOUX. WELL, NED, DO YOU SEE ANY PRACTICAL OBJECTION? ONLY CUSTER. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? WHAT CAN HE DO? YOU DON'T KNOW CUSTER. YOU GET HIM FIGHTING MAD, AND THERE ISN'T ANYTHING THAT HE WON'T DO. THERE ISN'T ANYTHING HIS REGIMENT WON'T DO IF HE GIVES THEM THE WORD. THEY COULD BLOCKADE BISMARCK, BLOW UP THE RAILROAD BRIDGES... AHH, THEN WE'LL HAVE TO GET RID OF COLONEL CUSTER AS A FIRST MEASURE, EH, TAIPE? I'M ALL FOR THAT... BUT I SHOULDN'T ADVISE DOING IT THROUGH OFFICIAL CHANNELS. I THINK I KNOW HOW TO GET RID OF COLONEL CUSTER TO EVERYBODY'S SATISFACTION. TURN OUT THE GUARD. COMMANDING OFFICER! FALL IN! [BUGLE BLOWS] PRESENT...ARMS! ORDER...ARMS! HELLO, ROBERTS. HOW'S YOUR WIFE? BETTER, SIR, THANKS TO MRS. CUSTER. GOOD, GOOD. NOW, LOOK, TOMORROW I WANT YOU TO SHINE THE SQUADRON UP, BRIGHT AND SNAPPY. I'M REVIEWING THEM FOR THE NEW COMMISSIONER WITHOUT OFFICERS. WITHOUT OFFICERS? RIGHT, SIR. STAND OVER THERE. LET ME LOOK AT YOU. MY WORD, YOU'RE LOVELIER THAN EVER. GEORGE, YOU MUST PUT ME DOWN. WE'VE GOT COMPANY. WHAT? YES. I'VE GOT A SURPRISE FOR YOU. A SURPRISE? MRS. TAIPE, MAY I PRESENT MY HUSBAND GENERAL CUSTER? A PLEASURE. MRS. SHARP, MY HUSBAND GENERAL CUSTER. AND HERE ARE SOME OLD FRIENDS OF YOURS. WELL... WHAT'S THIS? WELCOME HOME, COLONEL. A LITTLE SURPRISE FOR YOU. YES, THIS IS A SURPRISE. HAVEN'T SEEN YOU, SIR, SINCE YOU RETIRED FROM THE ARMY. WELL, AFTER THE WAR, I FOUND ARMY LIFE A TRIFLE MONOTONOUS, CUSTER. HE'S HERE AS A SPECIAL COMMISSIONER, YOU KNOW. OH. THEN IN THAT CASE, I SHOULD HAVE PAID MY RESPECTS TO YOU AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE GOVERNMENT. THAT'S THE REGULATION, I SUPPOSE, BUT THERE'S NO NEED TO STAND ON CEREMONY HERE. I MUST CONGRATULATE YOU, COLONEL, ON THE REPUTATION YOU'VE MADE FOR YOUR REGIMENT. THANK YOU, SIR. LET'S DRINK A TOAST TO IT. A TOAST TO THE 7th CAVALRY. RIGHT. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DRINK THIS TOAST IN WATER, ARE YOU, COLONEL? YES. FOR THE PRESENT, THIS IS THE DRINK OF THE 7th CAVALRY. WELL, TO THE SOBER 7th CAVALRY. [BUGLE PLAYING] I'M SORRY YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO SEE THE WHOLE REGIMENT OPERATE, MR. COMMISSIONER. MOST OF IT'S IN THE BLACK HILLS, BUT I CAN PROMISE YOU THAT TOMORROW YOU'LL TAKE THE SALUTE FROM ONE OF THE FINEST SQUADRONS OF CAVALRY THAT EVER RODE IN REVIEW. THERE'LL BE NO OFFICERS ON PARADE? VERY IRREGULAR, SIR. THAT'S BECAUSE I WANT YOU TO SEE THE MEN, THE MEN WHO FOUGHT 36 ENGAGEMENTS, WHO CLEARED AND PACIFIED THIS FRONTIER SINGLE-HANDED, WHO SWEATED AND STARVED DAY AFTER DAY AGAINST IMPOSSIBLE ODDS. THERE'S NO DENYING THEIR RECORD, COLONEL. I THINK IT WAS AN IDEA THAT MADE THEM, AN IDEA AND A SONG. YOU SHOULD'VE SEEN THEM THE DAY THEY WERE FIRST MUSTERED IN: DERELICTS, OUTCASTS, CRIMINALS OF EVERY KIND WHO JUST JOINED UP BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T MAKE A LIVING ANY OTHER WAY. WAIT'LL YOU SEE THEM NOW, MR. COMMISSIONER. WAIT'LL YOU SEE WHAT DISCIPLINE, DEVOTION TO DUTY, AND A LITTLE HUMAN UNDERSTANDING CAN DO. YOU'LL SEE MEN WHO AREN'T AFRAID TO LOOK DEATH IN THE FACE WITH PRIDE IN THEIR EYE. AND NOT FOR ANY MEASLY $13 A MONTH, BUT JUST BECAUSE THEY GOT PRIDE IN THEIR REGIMENT. GO OUT AND TAKE THE SALUTE, MR. COMMISSIONER. YOU'VE GOOD REASON TO, YOU AND EVERY OTHER CIVILIAN IN THE UNITED STATES. [WHOOPING AND SHOUTING] [BLOWS OFF-KEY] WHAT'S THE MEANING OF THIS OUTRAGE? I THINK I KNOW. YOU KNOW, IF I WAS YOU, MR. SHARP, I'D VAMOOSE. CUSTER'S LIABLE TO GO LOCO ABOUT THIS. I'M NOT GETTING OUT. HAVE THOSE BUNG-STARTERS HANDY WHEN GOLDILOCKS ARRIVES. HE'LL NEVER CLOSE THIS BAR AGAIN. THIS IS NONE OF YOUR AFFAIR, CUSTER. WE--WE OPENED BY AUTHORITY OF THE COMMISSIONER. THE DRINKS WERE FREE TO THE MEN IN HONOR OF HIS VISIT. STOP IT! STOP IT, CUSTER! YOU'RE DESTROYING PRIVATE PROPERTY. THAT'S AN ORDER, CUSTER. THIS BAR WAS OPENED BY MY AUTHORITY. YOUR AUTHORITY? IF YOUR MEN ARE DRUNKEN SOTS, THAT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY, NOT THE COMPANY'S. SOTS? YOU--YOU--YOU CONTEMPTIBLE PARASITE! I'LL SEE THAT HE'S RELIEVED OF HIS COMMAND. HE'LL BE IN WASHINGTON FOR A COURT-MARTIAL. [WHISTLE BLOWS] I DO WISH YOU'D STOPPED OFF IN CHICAGO AND SEEN UNCLE PHIL. WE WOULD ONLY HAVE BEEN IN WASHINGTON ONE DAY LATER, AND HE MIGHT HAVE HELPED YOU. I DON'T THINK ANYONE CAN HELP ME NOW. I STRUCK A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE GOVERNMENT, AND I'D DO IT AGAIN. WHEN THE FACTS ARE KNOWN, WHO IN ALL THE WORLD COULD BLAME YOU? YOU. I? YES, I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF YOU. THIS MESS HAS MADE ME REALIZE HOW SELFISH I'VE BEEN. OH, MY DEAR... TAKING YOU AWAY FROM YOUR HOME... COMFORT, PEACE OF MIND... MY DARLING, I KNEW WHAT I WAS DOING WHEN I MARRIED YOU. BUT I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT I WAS DOING TO YOU. I'VE MADE YOU GIVE UP EVERYTHING. I LOVE YOU. Conductor: SPRINGFIELD! 5-MINUTE STOP, 5 MINUTES. WHY DON'T YOU GET OFF AND GET A BREATH OF FRESH AIR? NO, I DON'T THINK SO, DARLING. THERE MAY BE SOME REPORTERS AROUND, AND I DON'T WANT TO SEE ANYONE. IS THERE ANYTHING I CAN GET YOU: MAGAZINE, CIGARS? NO, NOTHING. MAYBE A NEWSPAPER. AND YOU'D BETTER TAKE A LITTLE WALK YOURSELF. YOU'VE BEEN COOPED UP HERE WITH ME LONG ENOUGH. PAPERS? PAPERS? PAPER. HAVE YOU A CHICAGO OR WASHINGTON PAPER? CHICAGO RECORD HERALD, JUST OUT HALF AN HOUR AGO. ALL ABOUT THE BIG GOLD STRIKE IN THE BLACK HILLS. THE BLACK HILLS IN DAKOTA? YES, MA'AM. IT'S BIGGER THAN THE ONE IN CALIFORNIA, THEY SAY. LOOK AT THIS. HMM? LOOK. GOLD. "STRIKE IN THE BLACK HILLS. "THE STAMPEDE STARTED WHEN AN INDIAN SQUAW "TENDERED A NUGGET OF GOLD FOR SUPPLIES "IN THE WESTERN RAILROAD LAND AND TRADING COMPANY "AT FORT LINCOLN. "THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE RUSHING INTO THE BLACK HILLS." WHY, THAT'S WHAT MRS. TAIPE MUST'VE MEANT WHEN SHE SAID THAT THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WERE COMING TO DAKOTA AND ADVISED ME TO BUY STOCK IN THE COMPANY. MRS. TAIPE SAID THAT? YES, THE DAY YOU CAME BACK TO THE FORT. I DIDN'T REPEAT IT TO YOU BECAUSE I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS IMPORTANT, BUT NOW I SEE-- THE DAY I CAME BACK TO THE FORT, MRS. TAIPE KNEW THEN THAT THESE PEOPLE WERE COMING. BUT, LIBBY, DON'T YOU SEE? THIS INDIAN WOMAN ONLY CAME INTO THE FORT YESTERDAY. THEN THAT MUST MEAN-- THAT THERE'S NO GOLD. THAT IT'S A CONSPIRACY TO BREAK THE PEACE TREATY. A CONSPIRACY? YES. AND WHAT HAPPENED AT THE REVIEW WAS A PART OF IT. THEY HAD TO GET RID OF ME, AND NO WONDER. I'D HAVE HANGED THEM ALL FROM THE FORT GATES, TAIPE AND ALL THE REST OF THEM. I'D HAVE BURNT THE RAILROAD BRIDGES. AND I GAVE MY WORD TO CRAZY HORSE THAT THE SIOUX-- THE SIOUX. WHY, LIBBY, THOSE FOOLS DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'VE DONE. CONDUCTOR. CONDUCTOR. I'M TRYING TO SAY THAT THE COMMISSIONER IS SHARP'S BOUGHT MAN, THAT HE HAS AN INTEREST IN-- Sharp and Taipe: I OBJECT. Commissioner: OBJECTION SUSTAINED. I'M SORRY, COLONEL, BUT YOU MUST TRY TO CONFINE YOUR TESTIMONY TO ACTUAL PROOF OF CONSPIRACY. ALL RIGHT. I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THAT SHARP'S COMPANY TRICKED THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE INTO VIOLATING INDIAN TERRITORY WITH A LYING TALE OF A GOLD STRIKE AND THAT TAIPE WAS A PARTY TO THAT PLOT. THAT'S MERELY AN ACCUSATION, COLONEL. WHAT FACTS CAN YOU TELL US TO PROVE IT? 3 WEEKS BEFORE THERE WAS ANY TALK OF THIS SO-CALLED GOLD DISCOVERY, TAIPE'S WIFE SAID THAT SOON THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE-- I OBJECT TO SUCH TESTIMONY. IT'S HEARSAY. SUSTAINED. COLONEL CUSTER, WE CAN HEAR NO EVIDENCE OF THAT NATURE. IT'S INADMISSIBLE. INADMISSIBLE? DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING TO KEEP ME FROM TESTIFYING BY LEGAL SKULLDUGGERY? DO YOU THINK I'D LIE? NO, COLONEL, BUT YOU'RE NOT A LAWYER. THE TESTIMONY YOU'RE ATTEMPTING TO GIVE IS HEARSAY, THE WORDS OF ANOTHER PERSON. IT'S NEVER ADMISSIBLE. NEVER ADMISSIBLE? EXCEPT IN THE CASE OF A DYING DECLARATION, WHERE THE WORDS ARE SPOKEN OR WRITTEN IN A CERTAIN KNOWLEDGE OF APPROACHING DEATH. THEN YOU'LL HAVE PLENTY OF EVIDENCE OF THAT SORT WITHIN A FEW WEEKS. THE TREATY'S BEEN BROKEN. WITHIN A FEW WEEKS, THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WILL BE MASSACRED IN THE BLACK HILLS. THAT'S WHY I BLASTED THIS THING WIDE OPEN IN THE PRESS. AND NOW YOU WANT TO TALK TO ME ABOUT LEGAL TECHNICALITIES. THERE NEED BE NO APPREHENSION, GENTLEMEN. GENERAL TERRY AND GENERAL CROOK HAVE ORDERS TO CONCENTRATE THEIR FORCES IN THE YELLOWSTONE VALLEY. 3,000 AMERICAN SOLDIERS SHOULD BE MORE THAN A MATCH FOR 3,000 SIOUX. WHY, YOU FOOL, THOSE TROOPS ARE INFANTRY, USELESS AGAINST INDIANS. AND THEY WON'T FIND ANY 3,000 SIOUX. THE SANCTUARY OF THE ENTIRE RED RACE IS BEING VIOLATED. THEY'LL FIND EVERY TRIBE IN THE WEST MASSED THERE, READY TO OVERWHELM THEM. NOT ONLY THE SIOUX, BUT THE CHEYENNE, THE BLACKFEET, THE SANS ARCS, ALL THE REST OF THEM. AND WHO'S TO BLAME THEM? NOT I, GENTLEMEN. IF I WERE AN INDIAN, I'D FIGHT BESIDE CRAZY HORSE TO THE LAST DROP OF MY BLOOD. IT'S IN COLONEL CUSTER'S INTEREST TO BE AN ALARMIST. HE'S BEEN RELIEVED OF HIS COMMAND AND IS AWAITING COURT-MARTIAL. BUT THE WAR DEPARTMENT DOESN'T SHARE HIS FEARS, ESPECIALLY AS AMONG THE FORCES ORDERED INTO ACTION IS THE CELEBRATED 7th CAVALRY, WHICH BOASTS ITSELF MORE THAN ABLE TO DEFEND THE FRONTIER SINGLE-HANDED. COLONEL CUSTER, HAVE YOU ANY FURTHER TESTIMONY, RELEVANT TESTIMONY, TO PLACE BEFORE THE COMMITTEE? NONE. THEN I MOVE WE ADJOURN, GENTLEMEN. IS IT THAT BAD? I'LL START ASSEMBLING A DIVISION AT ONCE. BUT IT'LL TAKE TIME, CUSTER. TIME. TROOPS ON THE FRONTIER WILL HAVE TO BE SACRIFICED. INCLUDING THE 7th CAVALRY. WHAT ELSE CAN I DO? THERE'S THIS: GET MY COURT-MARTIAL POSTPONED. GET MY COMMAND RESTORED TO ME. AND LET YOU COMMIT SUICIDE? NO, THANK YOU. YOU DON'T OWE ANYBODY THAT. SHERIDAN, DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT YOU SAID TO ME AFTER WINCHESTER? YOU SAID, "IF THERE'S EVER ANYTHING YOU WANT FROM ME, "INCLUDING MY RIGHT ARM, DON'T ASK FOR IT, JUST TAKE IT." I WON'T DO IT. YOU DON'T OWE THOSE BLOODSUCKERS ANYTHING. I'M ASKING YOU NOW. THERE'S LIBBY TO BE CONSIDERED. I WOULDN'T DO IT IF I COULD, BUT I CAN'T. TAIPE WOULD NEVER LET IT GET THROUGH. THE ONLY MAN WHO COULD DO IT IS THE PRESIDENT. AND SINCE THESE CHARGES OF YOURS HAVE ALL BUT WRECKED HIS ADMINISTRATION, ULYSSES S. GRANT HATES THE SOUND OF YOUR NAME. COLONEL CUSTER? I REGRET THE PRESIDENT DECLINES TO SEE YOU. HE INSTRUCTS THAT ANY OFFICIAL BUSINESS YOU MAY HAVE SHALL BE CONDUCTED THROUGH THE WAR DEPARTMENT. I'LL REMIND YOU, SIR, THAT I'M PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. I'M NOT HERE TO SEE THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, GRANT. I'M HERE TO SEE A SOLDIER. YOU'VE CAUSED PLENTY OF TROUBLE, CUSTER, STICKING YOUR NOSE INTO POLITICS. I WANT MY REGIMENT BACK. ALL YOU'LL GET FROM ME IS A COURT-MARTIAL. TO THE DEVIL WITH A COURT-MARTIAL. I WANT MY REGIMENT BACK, GRANT. MAYBE YOU'LL TELL ME WHY I SHOULD GIVE IT TO YOU? I'LL TELL YOU WHY. BECAUSE YOU KNOW HOW A MAN FEELS WHEN HE'S BROKEN, WHEN HE'S LEFT BEHIND AND HIS REGIMENT'S MARCHING OUT TO FIGHT. YOU KNOW HOW HE FEELS, GRANT, BECAUSE YOU HAD A TASTE OF IT YOURSELF. [FOOTSTEPS] GET OUT. ALL RIGHT. MY ORDERS WAS TO CLOSE UP, COLONEL, AS SOON AS YOU GOT BACK. THAT'S ALL RIGHT. I JUST GOT IN. AND AM I GLAD TO SEE YOU. I'M GOING BUGHOUSE IN THIS JOINT. AND, COLONEL, SINCE YOU'VE BEEN RELIEVED OF YOUR COMMAND, NOT A SINGLE SOLDIER HAS SET HIS FOOT IN THIS PLACE. YES? INDEED. OH, THAT'S ALL RIGHT. YOU NEEDN'T BOTHER CLOSING UP. JUST TELL MR. SHARP I WANT TO SEE HIM. AND LEAVE US ALONE TOGETHER. OH, IT'S ALL RIGHT. THERE WON'T BE ANY DISTURBANCE. SAY, CUSTER'S OUTSIDE. HE WANTS TO SEE YOU. I, UH-- I GAVE ORDERS TO CLOSE THE BAR AS SOON AS I HEARD YOU TOOK COMMAND AGAIN. THAT'S ALL RIGHT, SHARP. REMEMBER I TOLD YOU ONCE THAT THE DAY I TOOK A DRINK, YOU COULD OPEN THE BAR UP? YEAH. WELL, I FEEL LIKE DRINKING TONIGHT. THINGS HAVE BEEN PRETTY BAD. WANT TO JOIN ME? WHY, SURE, SURE. WHY NOT? WE'LL LET BYGONES BE BYGONES, HUH? SURE. SAY, UH, HITTING IT KIND OF HARD, AREN'T YOU? NO POINT IN HALF-MEASURES. DRINK UP. I, UH, I HEAR THE 7th'S MARCHING OUT THIS MORNING TO MAKE CONTACT WITH CROOK AND TERRY AT THE LITTLE BIG HORN. MM-HMM. YES. THE 7th'S MARCHING OUT. LET'S DRINK TO THE 7th. LET'S DRINK TO 'EM AGAIN. LAST TIME I DRANK IT IN WATER, REMEMBER? WELL, WAIT A MINUTE. YOU-- DRINK IT. IF THE OTHER OUTFITS DON'T FIGHT THEIR WAY THROUGH, YOU'RE LIABLE TO HAVE A LOT OF SIOUX ON YOUR HANDS. YES. YES, QUITE A LOT OF SIOUX, SHARP. BUT THE GREATER THE ODDS, THE GREATER THE GLORY. COME ON, SHARP, LET'S DRINK TO GLORY. YOU ALWAYS WERE A GREAT ONE FOR GLORY, CUSTER. REMEMBER--REMEMBER THAT DAY YOU CAME TO WEST POINT, AND YOU TALKED TO ME ABOUT THE STATUES? YES, YES, I REMEMBER. WELL, YOU GOT GLORY. AND WHAT DID GLORY GET YOU? A TWO-BIT JOB AND A-- AND A COURT-MARTIAL. THAT'S ALL. WELL, THAT'S NOT ENOUGH. NOW WE'RE GOING TO DRINK TO SOMETHING THAT'S-- THAT'S WORTH HAVING, SOMETHING THEY'LL KISS YOUR FEET FOR HAVING. HERE'S TO MONEY, AND LONG MAY SHE JINGLE. MONEY. YOU MAY BE RIGHT ABOUT MONEY, SHARP, QUITE RIGHT. BUT THERE'S ONE THING TO BE SAID FOR GLORY. AND WHAT'S THAT? YOU CAN TAKE GLORY WITH YOU WHEN IT'S YOUR TIME TO GO. CALIFORNIA? [SPITS] [TRUMPET PLAYS REVEILLE] WELL, NOW, LET'S SEE. ANYTHING I'VE FORGOTTEN? FIELD GLASSES? YEP. COMPASS. GOT IT. YOUR WATCH. WATCH, NO. YOU KNOW, LIBBY, THEY OUGHT TO MAKE YOU QUARTERMASTER GENERAL. EVERY TIME I GO INTO THE FIELD, I'M THE BEST-EQUIPPED MAN IN THE REGIMENT. OH, LOOK AT THAT. BROKEN. WHAT? THE CHAIN. NOW I WON'T BE ABLE TO TAKE THIS WITH ME. IT'LL BE THE FIRST TIME YOU'VE EVER GONE INTO A CAMPAIGN WITHOUT IT. YES. WELL, THERE'S NO TIME TO HAVE IT FIXED, AND I DON'T WANT TO TAKE A CHANCE ON LOSING IT. I'LL LEAVE IT HERE. NOT MUCH MORE TIME. HERE'S YOUR CARTRIDGE BELT. YOU KNOW, I'M SURE YOU'RE THE FIRST SOLDIER THAT EVER BECAME A GENERAL WITHOUT LETTING HIS BELT OUT. OH-HO, BUT YOU WAIT UNTIL WE GET THAT STAFF JOB IN WASHINGTON AFTER THIS CAMPAIGN'S OVER. I'M GOING TO GROW A BIG TUMMY ON ME LIKE GENERAL WINFIELD SCOTT. YOU KNOW, HO HO HO. AND WE'LL GROW FAT AND HAPPY TOGETHER. TOGETHER. AND PEOPLE WILL SAY, "DON'T TELL ME THAT LIFE IN THE DAKOTAS "WAS FULL OF HARDSHIP. "LOOK AT GENERAL AND MRS. CUSTER. THEY CERTAINLY GREW FAT AND HAPPY ON IT." YOU... YOU HAVE BEEN HAPPY HERE, HAVEN'T YOU, LIBBY? DON'T I LOOK HAPPY? WELL, NOW LET'S SEE WHAT ELSE. OH, MY ORDERS. I PUT THEM IN THAT DRAWER OVER THERE. ALL RIGHT, I'LL GET IT. WELL, WHAT'S THIS? "MY LIFE WITH GENERAL CUSTER." OH, DARLING, THAT'S MY DIARY. I DIDN'T KNOW YOU KEPT ONE. IT'S JUST A RECORD OF OUR LIFE HERE TOGETHER. IT WOULDN'T INTEREST YOU. JUST THE SILLY THINGS THAT SEEM IMPORTANT TO A WOMAN. "TOMORROW MY HUSBAND LEAVES, "AND I CANNOT HELP BUT FEEL "THAT MY LAST HAPPY DAYS ARE ENDED. "A PREMONITION OF DISASTER "SUCH AS I HAVE NEVER KNOWN "IS WEIGHING ME DOWN. "I TRY TO SHUT IT INTO MY HEART, "BUT IT IS ALMOST UNBEARABLE. "I PRAY GOD I BE NOT ASKED TO WALK ON ALONE." YOU KNOW, I PROBABLY WROTE THAT, OR SOMETHING LIKE IT, EVERY TIME YOU WENT AWAY, EVEN FOR A DAY'S JOURNEY. YOU KNOW HOW FOOLISH WOMEN ARE. EVERY PARTING HAS ITS OWN FEARS AND ANXIETIES. OF COURSE. I OFTEN FEEL LIKE THAT MYSELF. BUT IT--IT HAS ITS BRIGHT SIDE, TOO. THE MORE SADNESS IN PARTING, THE MORE JOY IN THE REUNION. [BUGLE PLAYS] BOOTS AND SADDLES. GOOD-BYE. WALKING THROUGH LIFE WITH YOU, MA'AM, HAS BEEN A VERY GRACIOUS THING. Butler: ATTENTION! SIR, THE REGIMENT IS FORMED. FORWARD, HO! SCOUTS OUT. GRAY EAGLE. LONG HAIR. BLACK HILLS. GO TO LODGE OF SITTING BULL. LET HIM CALL SIOUX CHIEFS TO WAR COUNCIL. Officer: HALT! MEET US ON THE LITTLE BIG HORN AT SUNUP. WELL, PARDNER, THE--THE SCOUTS ARE BACK. WHAT'S THE REPORT? ANY NEWS OF CROOK'S COLUMN? THERE'S PLENTY OF 'EM, ALL SCALPED. DEAD LONG? OH, ABOUT A WEEK, I RECKON. CRAZY HORSE ATTACKED CROOK'S OUTFIT COMIN' DOWN A STREAM AND MASSACRED 'EM GOOD AND PROPER. AND THEN CROOK, HE HIGH-TAILED IT BACK TO WHERE HE--TO WHERE HE COME FROM, CROOK DID. HE GOT AWAY, EH? WHERE'S CRAZY HORSE NOW? CAMPED ON THE OTHER SIDE OF LITTLE BIG HORN. HE'S HEADED NORTH TO MASSACRE TERRY'S OUTFIT. THEN HE'S BETWEEN US, AND I CAN'T REACH TERRY IN TIME. CRAZY HORSE MUST KNOW WE'RE HERE, OF COURSE. MORE GOL-DARN INDIANS CAMPED OVER ON LITTLE BIG HORN THAN THERE IS GRASSHOPPERS IN A CORNFIELD. EVERY KIND OF A GOL-DARN INDIAN YOU CAN THINK OF! YOU KNOW, PARDNER, WE BETTER VAMOOSE OUT OF HERE GOOD AND PRONTO. WE'RE NOT VAMOOSING. I'M GOING TO ATTACK. ATTACK?! IT'S TERRY OR US. WHAT CHANCE HAS HIS INFANTRY GOT AGAINST THOUSANDS OF INDIANS? MM-HMM. WHAT--WHAT-- WHAT BETTER CHANCE HAVE YOU GOT? IT'S A CAVALRY JOB, JOE. I CAN DO MORE DAMAGE. AND IF I CAN DO ENOUGH, IT'LL GIVE TERRY A CHANCE TO STAND THEM OFF UNTIL SHERIDAN COMES UP FROM BISMARCK. I'M WONDERIN' IF I'M EVER GONNA GET TO CALIFORNIA. TELL MR. BUTLER I WANT TO SEE HIM. ALL RIGHT, PARDNER. I MEAN, YES, SIR. YOU SENT FOR ME, SIR? YES, BUTLER. I WANT YOU TO TAKE THIS LETTER INTO FORT LINCOLN TONIGHT. ME? TONIGHT? TONIGHT. IT'S IMPORTANT. MUST BE IF IT NEEDS YOUR BALLY ADJUTANT TO PLAY POSTMAN AT A TIME LIKE THIS. WHY ARE YOU ASKING ME TO GO BACK WITH IT? WELL, FOR ONE THING, YOU'RE AN ENGLISHMAN, NOT AN AMERICAN. NOT AN AMERICAN? WHAT DO YOU YANKEES THINK YOU ARE? THE ONLY REAL AMERICANS IN THIS MERRY OLD PARISH ARE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HILL WITH FEATHERS IN THEIR HAIR. YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT ABOUT THAT. BUT THERE'S 6,000 OF THEM AND LESS THAN 600 OF US. THE REGIMENT'S BEING SACRIFICED, BUTLER. I WOULDN'T WANT TO SEE A FOREIGNER BUTCHERED IN A DIRTY DEAL LIKE THIS. SPORTING OF YOU TO THINK OF IT THAT WAY. BUT I'LL REMIND YOU, SIR, I'M A MEMBER OF THE MESS OF THE 7th U.S. CAVALRY. FANCY WALKING INTO THE SERVICE CLUB IN PICCADILLY IF THE REGIMENT-- GET SOMEBODY ELSE TO POST YOUR BLINKING LETTER. THANKS, "QUEEN'S OWN." JUST SO LONG AS YOU KNOW. I'LL GET SOMEONE ELSE. [SPEAKING NATIVE LANGUAGE] SIOUX! CHEYENNE! MINICONJOU! SANS ARCS. OGLALA! SHOSHONE! BLACKFOOT! [SPEAKING NATIVE LANGUAGE] YOU'LL PAY FOR THIS, CUSTER. THERE'S A LAW IN THIS COUNTRY AGAINST ABDUCTION. YOU'LL GO TO JAIL FOR IT. MAYBE, SHARP, MAYBE. WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING? CUT ME LOOSE. SAY, WHAT IS ALL THIS? WHAT DOES IT MEAN? IT MEANS YOU'RE FREE. FREE? I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE I AM, WHAT DAY IT IS. IT'S ABOUT DAWN ON THE 25th OF JUNE. YOU'RE ON THE ROSEBUD RIDGE ABOVE THE LITTLE BIG HORN RIVER. THE WAY HOME'S DUE EAST. THE WAY HOME FROM THE LITTLE BIG HORN?! WHY, THIS WHOLE COUNTRY'S SWARMING WITH SIOUX! THAT'S RIGHT, SHARP, IT IS. WHY, IT'S MURDER. WH-WHAT CHANCE WILL I HAVE? ABOUT THE SAME CHANCE AS THE THOUSANDS OF OTHER POOR DEVILS YOU SENT IN HERE WITH THAT LYING TALE ABOUT THE GOLD. I SAY IT'S MURDER. I WON'T GO. YOU DON'T HAVE TO, SHARP. IT'S FOR YOU TO CHOOSE. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? YOU MEAN-- YOU MEAN YOU'LL LEAVE ME HERE? NO. THE REGIMENT RIDES IN ABOUT AN HOUR. YOU CAN RIDE WITH IT IF YOU WANT. WHERE IS THE REGIMENT RIDING? TO HELL, SHARP, OR TO GLORY. IT DEPENDS ON ONE'S POINT OF VIEW. NOT DEAD LONG. BIG WAR PARTY GO. SIOUX! FORWARD RANK, HO! [SHOUTING WAR CRIES] [BUGLE PLAYS] DRAW SABER! CHARGE! [BUGLE PLAYS CHARGE] FIGHT ON FOOT! [BUGLE PLAYS] YA DIRTY YELLOWBELLIES! OH, LOOKS LIKE I'LL NEVER GET TO... MAYBE YOU WERE RIGHT... ABOUT GLORY. I NEEDN'T TELL YOU, BUT FOR THE DESPERATE ATTACK OF THE 7th CAVALRY, TERRY'S FORCE WOULD'VE BEEN WIPED OUT, THE SQUATTERS WOULD HAVE BEEN MASSACRED, THE WHOLE FRONTIER OVERRUN, BISMARCK ITSELF DESTROYED. I'LL MAKE IT A POINT TO SEE THAT THE REGIMENT GETS DUE RECOGNITION FROM CONGRESS. LET ME REMIND YOU THAT ALL CUSTER SAID CAME TRUE. EVERY INDIAN ON THE FRONTIER GATHERED TO DEFEND THE BLACK HILLS, AND THE TROOPS WHICH YOU SENT AGAINST THEM WERE OVERWHELMED. THE PUBLIC, GENTLEMEN, HAS BEGUN TO WONDER IF MAYBE SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS HE TRIED TO SAY MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN TRUE ALSO. BY WHAT AUTHORITY DO YOU PRESUME TO TALK TO ME LIKE THIS? BY AUTHORITY OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. CUSTER HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO TELL EVERYTHING HE KNEW AT THE CONGRESSIONAL INQUIRY. HE HAD A FAIR HEARING. A FAIR HEARING, TAIPE? I HEARD THEM TELL HIM THAT HIS TESTIMONY WAS INADMISSIBLE, EXCEPT AS A DYING DECLARATION. WELL, CUSTER'S DEAD, BUT YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR HIM SPEAK. YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY TO THESE GENTLEMEN, LIBBY? I HAVE HERE A LETTER FROM MY HUSBAND ADDRESSED TO THE NATION. IT CONTAINS NOTHING WITH WHICH YOU ARE NOT FAMILIAR, ONLY A RESTATEMENT OF THE EVIDENCE HE ATTEMPTED TO PUT BEFORE CONGRESS. THAT EVIDENCE WAS RULED HEARSAY, MERE HEARSAY. MY HUSBAND WROTE THIS LETTER ON THE MORNING OF JUNE THE 25th IN ANTICIPATION OF HIS DEATH ON THAT DAY. HE BELIEVED IT TO BE WHAT THE COMMITTEE CALLED A DYING DECLARATION, AND AS SUCH, ADMISSIBLE IN A COURT OF LAW. YOU HEAR THAT, SHARP? WHY, IF THAT LETTER GETS OUT, WE'LL BE LYNCHED! WELL, SAY SOMETHING, MAN. IT DOESN'T SEEM TO MATTER, TAIPE. MY SON CHOSE TO GO TO HIS DEATH WITH THE 7th CAVALRY. AND I THINK I KNOW WHY. THERE IS A PRICE FOR WHICH IT CAN BE BOUGHT. COLONEL CUSTER'S PRICE. WELL, WHAT IS IT? NAME IT. THE COMPANY MUST BE DISSOLVED. THE COMPANY IS DISSOLVED. MR. TAIPE, YOU MUST RESIGN YOUR OFFICE AS COMMISSIONER. RESIGN? AND BEFORE YOU LEAVE THIS ROOM. AND THERE IS ANOTHER PRICE, GENERAL SHERIDAN. THE PRICE THE ADMINISTRATION MUST PAY. THE ADMINISTRATION MUST MAKE GOOD ITS PROMISE TO CHIEF CRAZY HORSE. THE INDIANS MUST BE PROTECTED IN THEIR RIGHT TO AN EXISTENCE IN THEIR OWN COUNTRY. I HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO ANSWER THAT FROM THE ADMINISTRATION, FROM THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF. COME, MY DEAR. YOUR SOLDIER WON HIS LAST FIGHT, AFTER ALL. CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY WARNER BROS.
