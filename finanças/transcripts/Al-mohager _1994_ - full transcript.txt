Like Joseph, son of Jacob in the Bible, Ram, exposed to the hostility of nature and the brutality of his tribe, leaves his country to go to Egypt in search of knowledge. This film is the story of his quest... Ram! Come quickly! The wolves! They're attacking our flock! Gader! -Better wait till your father comes back. -Better not! Ram's very dear to him. His darling son! Dearer than all of us. But he'll get a whipping just the same! Your father will never forgive you! To hell with forgiveness! He must pay for this! That's for your father to decide. Gader's the eldest. Right, so I decide. Keep out of our family's business! A bit of advice never hurts. -Stick it! -Ram wants what's best for you. What devil brought you back from Egypt? They have whipped him. These six madmen have whipped him in a frenzy. My own sons. Where's Ram? He's praying at the well. He didn't groan even once. While I bowed down before God, they made my son bow down under their whips. Why this mad haste? Six brothers against one! He abandoned the flock to go play with Bechir. The flock belongs to me. I decide what one or a hundred lost sheep are worth! If you punish him so while I'm alive, what will you do to him once I'm dead? You're not going to die, Father. May God give you another thousand years! I just want enough time to do what I have to do. I decide who gets what! Ram. Ram! You look at the Heavens. All you see is the moon and the stars. Where's the Creator Himself? You've always told me Mother was as beautiful as the moon. I was calling on her. You're right. Every full moon, your mother is near me, just as you are now. Show me your back. Show me your back. It's not important, Father. Father, I want to go and study in Egypt, the country of light. You want to flee your brothers' hatred. Show me your back. No. I want to travel to learn how to farm the land. I'm sick of following the animals in search of fresh pastures. They eat and we watch them. Is that reasonable? I want to be able to sow barley instead of searching for it. I want to learn how to protect the flock from the wolves, from the drought, from the south winds. You'd leave me for years? To go towards the light. To Egypt, the country of knowledge. Instead of being buried here in the sand and being lost. Father, let me leave. I can see your mind is made up. Why the rush? Why are you in such a rush? To get a head start on the winds. Do they threaten us as well? The south winds, Father. Look. There's the North Star, so this is... the south wind. You can see it all. God gave you his grace. Salem! Salem! Tell your father to shelter the animals in the big cave in the red mountain. There's a storm coming! Hurry, Salem! -A mountain of sand's coming our way! -Oh, yeah? Is it coming on foot, by camel, or by donkey? Hurry! The storm is here! You're built like a wall. Stretch your arms and hold it back! Run and take the animals to the cave. I'll go and warn Father. Father! How small is man faced with the power of the Almighty! Yes, it's the power of the Almighty! But do you think that Ram predicted the disaster by coincidence? If Ram's... brothers' gratitude was as strong as their hatred, they'd all be embracing him now. I can't believe it. You're the one who saved us, our children and our animals, Ram. You have divine grace. I lost Ram's mother eight years ago. Now I'm losing him. It's just for a few years. He'll return a wiser man. And he will help us all. He'll bring you happiness. I miss him already and he hasn't even left yet. Now that the whole family is united once again, I'll take a little from everyone's share to pay for... Ram's journey. Catch. Robbing us of half of what we own, so Ram can go and blow it all in Egypt. It's madness! I'll only give him 30 sheep whether they agree or not. I've got six children. Should I give half of them too? And what did Ram do exactly? He saw the storm coming and warned us. Did he see the storm coming, Noman? Or did he make it happen? I've seen Ram pick up sand and run it through his fingers. He then rushed to the magic tree, banged his head on the ground and mumbled strange words. He bewitches nature? And animals and people too. And now he's after me. Ram and Bechir are casting spells on me, so that I give birth to another girl. But I know best. In Basma's belly, is it a boy or another girl? I think it's a boy. You think or you know? You were tossing and mumbling in your sleep. Were you dreaming of my son? Or was I your nightmare? Relax and go back to sleep, back to your dreams. Why are you so hard on yourself? Do you feel it's another girl? Swallow your tongue, woman! It'll be a boy. It'll be a boy, and he'll gouge Ram's eyes out, and everyone else's eyes! Pile the stones up! Gods of fertility. They will never refuse my request. Basma, supposing... Supposing it's a girl, are we going to give up? -There's only one solution. -We must get rid of Ram. Yes, we get rid of Ram. -There are just men around you. -No, there's a woman! There are nine men around you. -No. A woman has come in! -Not the slightest hint of one! Protect him, so he can take Grandfather's place and will be bursting with health. He'll take Grandfather's place and will be bursting with health. He'll take Grandfather's place and will be bursting with health. It's a girl! I'll kill her! Give her to me! I'll kill her! No, it's Ram who must be killed. The gods have ordered that Ram be killed. -By whom? -Basma. She's had a girl. I shall return with the knowledge needed to save us all, Father. My brothers will have children and I... And you... will be our provider? Right? Salma? Our son is leaving us. Can you hear him? What do you think about all this? What do you think? We shall have a rich land with babbling brooks that sing the glory of the one God. Now I know that you will come back to me. Come on, we're late! Father, I want to go with them! Let's watch them from up here. Bechir, Gader! Unload the camels and find a place for the night. Noman, Hosban, Nadah, Obeid, and I will look for a ship to take you. Ram will accompany us. Hurry, Ram! Hurry! Nadah, move! If we got lost, we'll meet up here near that tavern. Hurry! -Are you sailing? -We just arrived. -Are you on your own? -I'm the captain's son. I don't take passengers. -Can we discuss it? -Discuss what? Listen. We'll discuss it. We might come to an understanding or not. Everyone is free to do what they want. What do you think? Just sit and listen to what I have to offer. -I don't get it. -Take this. You're just a bunch of braggarts and you're wasting my time! No deal then? It's your loss. Roast quail falls in your lap and you turn it down? Right, men. Let's go. Move. Let's go We threw him in the hold. -Bechir's the problem now. -Look, here he is. Where's Ram? We put him on the ship and that's it. Is he the one going to Egypt or is it you? I still have his clothes. He's lucky he got a place. We stopped a ship on the high seas. Or should we have asked you first? If you weren't such cowards, I'd say you killed him or maybe sold him. What? Did I hear correctly? Did you say "sold him"? -Sell our own brother! -Our flesh and blood? -I didn't see him go. -That's your problem! Blood! Where's it from, Obeid? Hands off! -We will kill you too! -I guessed right! You killed him! Hey, Noman! Nadah! He's insulting us! Shame on you, Tobal! Shame on all of you! Gader! We left him in the hold. No one will know. Better to have killed him! If you don't have the guts, why start something you can't finish? -You didn't feed the chickens! -They've got grain for a week. Help yourself, boy. -Where are we headed? -What? Where are you taking me? Taking you? We found you in the hold. So you're part of the merchandise. You'll come with us wherever we go. We'll sell you to the first buyer we find. Tell me. -Why the fascination for Egypt? -Everything I seek is there. You're a weird kid. I'll sell you to the head of the King's army. -Which king? -Amenophis. -The Pharaoh of Egypt? -Amihar's head of his army. He's a difficult man, but if he buys you, he'll open the gates of paradise for you. Father, do we really have to sell Ram? We're poor, son. Of course we have to sell him. Providence sent him to us. Maybe it's his destiny too. Why are you wasting our time? We've been here since dawn. -No! -One calf and two geese! Let's finish this! We've been here since dawn. -One calf and two geese. -No! One will even things out. You're kidding. I can read and write. I'm worth one calf and two geese at least. Here's the other. We have a deal. -All right. -Give it to me. Move, crook! Hand over the calf. No one's told me what to do. I've been here six months, and I still don't know. They look at me and ask strange questions. He's cunning, old Ozir. He saw me making a basket once. And since then, I've made 600. What can you do? Nothing. I'm here to learn agriculture, the whys and wherefores, then I'm going back home. Home? You're not free now, they bought you. Who got you into this mess? The Lord, perhaps. Why? I'll manage. She's pretty. She is my sister. "You are the greatest... You... are... the... infinite..." Infinite... An infinite idiot! To the kitchens! -Name? -Ram. A foreign name. It'll jinx us. Go to the kitchens. Son. -Who taught you Egyptian? -My father's friend. He's often been to Egypt. -Where are you from? -Tonay. -A stupid shepherd! Go with them. -I'll read. "O majestic Ra, whose smile makes the whole world rejoice, whose heart beats to the rhythm of the universe..." I said go to the kitchens. I'll read that. "The Pharaoh stands on a chariot driven by two lightning steeds. He points arrows towards the enemies. A huge panic ensues. People try to flee. Horses fall in hundreds from his arrows. An apocalyptic vision from hell! The sand turns red with blood! Then the sovereign's dogs finish off the few remaining enemies. And the king attacks the remaining survivors and arrests them all. This is how the battle ends, with doom to anyone who dares affront the glory of Egypt!'' How's that? -What's that? -The statue of Amon. I mean the temple there. The Sanctuary of Knowledge. Only ministers, geniuses, and their guards are allowed inside. Their keeper is our master, the one who bought you and me. One at a time! Keep back! Keep back! Keep back! Amon. -Amon. -Lord of lords. Amon. Source of all rivers. Amon. Source of all light. Amon. Amon. Amon. Amon. Amon. Amon. Amon. Can you find your way back? Where's he going? To kneel before the tyrant? Run! Run! Wipe out the criminals! Wipe them out! Mother's very ill. I'm worried about her. I knew they'd rebel. Thousands are dreamers, just like you. But there's no hope. -Is the Sanctuary your aim? -Do they hold the key to farming? From mummification to building a pyramid. -And farming. -Do you want to farm the desert? I have come such a long way. To be so near, and yet so far. How will you get past the gate? There's only one other way in. Where the stones for the new temple go through. Stones go through, but I can't. Why not turn yourself into a stone? -How did you get in here? -He's a spy! It's coming from there. Stop! If anyone touches me, I'll have his head cut off! I belong to Amihar, the Commander! I'll make him kill you all. He's not the one we should punish. Call the head guard. Who sent you? I came by myself. I am seeking education. Who told you about the secret passage? I tripped and fell down here. Give me something to do which isn't mindless. You want to build a pyramid? In my town, Tonay, the drought starves us, and the flood divides us. -A nomad. -A shepherd. -My father's head of our tribe. -You're their prince then. A prince is someone who seeks knowledge. A prince is someone who shares knowledge with others. You know who I am? After what you said, you can only be Commander Amihar. Commander-in-chief. Only you can make things happen. Say yes. This place is built to stop even a cockroach. That is so. And that? Find him an intelligent job, if there is one. Commander-In-Chief Amihar! It's not our custom to summon someone of your rank in the middle of the night, Amihar. -But... -It's a good custom. Why not stick to it? We were relaxing. A little wine to free the spirit? Amihar, I spend my nights reassessing the day's events. That incident during the procession, head of Amon's guards, requires action. No more processions then. People have had a bellyful. Your presence was indispensable, Amihar. My job is to protect us from enemy attack. What about the enemy within? The Sect of Aton is growing. Have you stopped to wonder why? If there's a flaw in my way of ruling, let's discuss it. -Sit down. -Nobody ever listens! You'll listen to me first! The rebels caught today are to be executed! If we falter, we're lost! If you'll excuse me. My brain only functions during the day. Good night. I'm so sleepy. I command you to attend Prince Sanouhar's mummification tomorrow! Listen, I must talk to the mummified. I'll tell him this is not working. What they do is admirable, I know, but I'm not in the least bit interested. Patience. Lower your voice. Someone may hear you. What does this have to do with farming? -I'll tell him. -Are you crazy? Who's that? He belongs to Commander Amihar. He recommended him to us. Where did he pick him up? Seems he's from Tonay. So he's a foreigner. A foreigner in the hall of mummification? How lovely. What can I do with that? Not enough to mummify even a toe. Move. Bear with me. My aunt promised me a gold amulet. -Please take this. -Listen, Hati. Your mother lived, and she had you and your brother. Now she's back in the kingdom of oblivion. End of story. I have nothing to offer but words. I'd like to hear them. I was 15 when I lost my mother. Is she in the world of oblivion too? On the contrary. She's with the one true God. He has a place for even the most humble of us. It is to Him that our soul returns. -My mother was kind. -Then the Lord will reward her. And after a long life, after you get married and have children, you'll meet again and you'll get to hug her. But how? Neither of us will have a body anymore. How will I recognize her? Close your eyes. Think of her. Can you see her? Yes, on the floor, vomiting and hallucinating. Good God! What a horrible vision. Imagine her singing, hanging out the washing. Go on. Well? Hanging out the washing. Each time you think of her, she'll come into your heart. Your soul will tell you she's there. It is your souls that will meet again. The body is dust, even mummified. What was your mother's name? -Monia. -Mine was called Salma. Close your eyes. Is she there? They hold the key to the afterlife. One wrong word and they'll refuse to mummify you. Then you're nothing. Pay and you get eternal life, but Hati's mother gets nothing. Lower your voice. The walls have ears. Talk of the devil. No! Amon's guards are attacking! Do Amon's tenets bother you that much? I fainted, that's all. -You weren't beaten? -I was beaten, all right. Who by? The Grand Mummifier? No, in the streets. By Amon's soldiers. Your own men. I was wrong. I thought you knew better than to get involved. It made me sick. The Sanctuary made you sick? All this effort for the dead. It would've been better to help save the living. Or they could've found a cure for your toothache. You dare challenge our greatest minds? With your permission, I dare. Care to listen to him? This is Ram. He thinks he's a revolutionary but faints at the sight of a mummy. Speak! Why conserve an empty shell that has no soul? When all has turned to dust, these mummies that you disdain will represent the glory of Amon, God of gods. You have so many gods you get mixed up. Yet there's only one God. You think you can convince the High Priestess, the fiancée of Amon, Princess Simihit? Without wishing to offend, Your Highness, I only seek knowledge, while respecting other people's beliefs. It's sacrilege to believe in Aton, the sun god. You know this, don't you? I know. Are you one of them? I wouldn't have hidden it from the man who gave me a home. I felt life. Your only talent is fainting. That's all. We are nomads. I came to learn about agriculture. That's all. The Pharaoh gave me a piece of land near the border. If you can cultivate it and ward off famine, even just a little... it's yours. You'll set off with Ozir at dawn. We'll make it a paradise. You'll see. And how is Amon's fiancée? Fine. Do you need anything? Maybe you're bored? I'm never bored. You've got rings under your eyes. You need to rest. Both of us... need to sleep. Sweet dreams. Same to you. You're the god of what? Eunuchs and charlatans? When will you relieve people of your presence? And you, God of life, you're just drought and death. -Her eyes are strangely serene. -Whose? The High Priestess of Amon. Oh, we met her too, did we? I turned and there she was. Amihar and I were talking. Talking like old friends, you mean? He was gentle as a lamb with her. A woman prefers a real man. And he isn't. Are you kidding? With his build? He was a eunuch in the harem. It led him to become commander-in-chief. Not bad, eh? Berri, hold your tongue! So, why does she live with him? She's not bothered. Her mission concerns all of mankind. Each goes his own way. What a strange couple. I'm glad I'm leaving. Amihar has given me a piece of land far away. So do I give myself to Amon? I didn't promise you anything. We'll get married. Berri couldn't care less if I become an old spinster. I'll ask for Ozir's blessing. And later tonight, I'll ask the Princess. Are you crazy? Get married? I'm too young. Young how? Are you also short of something? -God forbid. -That's settled then. Go have a walk in the garden. -Tell your mistress to receive me. -She's getting dressed. She must be warned. Her plan for tonight is very dangerous. Have you spoken in front of Ram? -Why not? -Of tonight's meeting? You're mad! I have no secrets from my husband. Tonight, I'll ask the Princess' permission. What about mine? Freedom must be ripped from the wolf's jaws. You taught me that. I'm warning you. Breathe one word of this, and we'll all end up behind bars. You're old. You lost your spirit. -You've become a coward. -A coward? Me? Those fools, Hati and Berri, talking openly in front of Ram. -Ram who? -That foreign slave we bought. The tall, dark one? "Tall, dark one''? He's a foreigner. If you're frightened to join us, then don't come. Simihit, the old Pharaoh is going crazy. When his son takes over, you can change gods as often as you like. Tell Hati to bring the foreigner. Aton is generous. Everyone has a place under his sun. Not like greedy Amon. -Got a minute? -Speak. -I find it oppressive here. -So do I. My only aim is the land. I want to learn how to farm it. I need you to teach me. Don't fool yourself. The land Amihar has given you is barren. Ten times we tried, 15 times we failed. We'll make it a paradise. Are you leaving Hati behind? I need my freedom. You're running away then. So shall I. Can you see me spending my nights with the High Priest? Teach me how to farm. My fate is to spend my life educating fools. Get away from me. I'll be your teacher, not your mother! I'm coming. Ready! -There's water too. -It's seawater. It's not suitable for farming. -Let's jump in the water. -Let's go. Let's jump! There are plenty of fish! Tie the stems, or the wind will blow it all away. The south wind, I've already come across it. It's merciless. Not if we're careful. At least in this area. -And if I am... -Don't argue. Keep on working. If the wind blows, we stop it. If we find water, we collect it. Where's this water then? Two months we've been digging and still nothing. The well is dry. We'll dig another. Nature has to be tamed. If you let her have her way, she'll crush you. Lord, we have been digging for three months. Are we going to fail? How can I get back to my father? What an idea to have six kids. You and your brother were enough. They were there first. Hello, Ahouri! -I'm here. -Uncle Ozir! How is everybody? -Block the furrow. -Hang on, I'll add this. Hati, block the furrow until the water reaches you. Is this the end of the world? No pain, no gain. No pain? The well broke our backs. Our only hope now is rain. Some water from the well and some rain would be sublime, or we'll still be at it in another 100 years' time. That's a nice rhyme, but only poets can understand. You're right. To bloom, a flower needs care and attention, but only poets can understand. Nonsense! We just missed our chance. Why are you sulking? You're the one who brought us here. If you... Quick! Grab a bag of seeds and follow me! Hold this! I knew it! What a genius I am! Scatter the seeds everywhere! Go on! Hati, I'm entrusting you with the girl. She's the only family I have left. -Are you sad to see me go? -Not at all. I get on very well with them. Bye. Duty calls. The situation is urgent. Amihar needs me at his side. She already said goodbye. Are you in a hurry to see me go? Was I such a pain in the neck? With crops like that one, another three or four years and you'll be somebody. We couldn't have done it without you. We all need each other. But why? Why? Why? The fruit of a year's work reduced to nothing! Amihar's orders! Amihar is the most honorable of men. But this is damage that comes from envy. -Remove your sword. -Don't make me use force, Ozir! Our prisons are full of dealers! Dealers? I'm a dealer! It's grain! We spent three years in drought. Is it famine you want? How dare you meddle in politics? I warned you! Take him away! Give us a kiss, Princess! We're deprived of everything. Give him a kiss! Get away from there! Shut up! Even the bravest have bowed down. What about Amihar? He's lying low. You stayed there a long time. Was your farming a failure? You should've seen the ears of barley swaying like a green sea. A huge one. What a joy to behold. All of a sudden, the rain came. The four of us started sowing seeds like crazy. Four of you? Berri and his sister Hati joined us. Are they still there? Yes, but it's not easy. There's not much rain. But we can count on them. They'll make it. Ram's determined. He'll succeed. So they've forgotten us. "Dig a little, the water will gush out. You can do it." Are you blaming us? Admit it, you're lazy! Well, make your own dinner then! "Dig a little, the water will gush out.'' We've failed. We should pack up and go. What are we waiting for? Fresh water. Hey! Fresh water! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Pull, Berri. We will make the water flow... till it has enough! Don't drown everything! Tie your side up. Your eyes are sad. If you want me, I'll follow you. -Would you abandon your homeland? -You're my homeland. -My people are rough. -We'll refine them. -Our land is barren. -We'll make it fertile. Ram, stop beating around the bush. If you want me, just say so. Take my hand in yours and say... Hati, I want you to be mine. -You said it! -How about it? -I'll get the washing. -Do it tomorrow. I'm not afraid of the dark. Ozir is ill. He asked Princess Simihit to let him see his granddaughter. I'll go with her. But do me a favor. Keep my family with you. Look after them. It'll put my mind at ease. It's hell back there. Every day, there's fighting in the streets. Get your things ready. We're going to your grandfather. Where were you? You arrived at dawn. -Ozir was very ill. -Not as much as me! -Where is he? -Ozir? Ram? He's crying. Ozir is dead. -Ram needs to rest. -Yes, a month on the road... I said Ram needs to rest. Do you get the message? Follow me. You're the first to set foot here. You'll live here and tend to the Princess' garden. I'm no gardener. Such modesty. It's part of your charm. Oh, shit. He's run away. He's gone. What do you mean "gone''? When you're gone, you're no longer there. Maybe he's gone back to the desert. Or back home. You handled him badly. I simply mentioned gardening. Honestly, this is unbelievable! Putting so much trust in foreigners. Is it so awful to tend to my garden? Is it so humiliating? Let him plant pumpkins if he wants! Ram! Ram! Ram! What do you want? I must confess, you're not here for the gardening. I wanted to see you again. Any harm in that? Well, here I am. Don't you want to see me too? I've been busy. And at night... didn't you dream of me even once? What's the point? So you did. You're beautiful but your eyes are so sad. You've noticed my sad eyes? Tell me all about it. Speak. Speak. I want to hear what you have to say. I want to know you better. Tell me all about yourself. My tale would take seven moons to tell. So? We have plenty of time. You're still young. Go ahead and speak. -Queen Tyi is... -Tell her I'm not here. -May I remind you... -I said tell her I'm not here. Let's go. Understand? If my eternal life interested you, you'd have at least glanced at my sarcophagus. What exactly is my purpose here? Escort? Court jester? Supervisor of my purchases. Call it what you like. What a great honor. How about jewelry advisor? Beauty unparalleled, divinity incarnate. -Say something. -Remarkable. Well? Erasing all trace of Amon is a job that will... That will take time. I'm sick of telling you. Aton's sun must replace Amon everywhere. We have to stop hesitating, or we will be lost. Show me the plans. Right away. Farmers fascinate you, but not my sarcophagus? Here is life, there is death. I'm so used to being alone that I feel all funny inside and a bit ashamed to be so happy because you're here. Of course, it's all the same to you. You just think about going home. I, too, am a foreigner. But I no longer have a homeland. Amihar's troops wiped it off the map. And what about Amihar? He's the great leader who spared me. I'm the princess who opens doors for him. That's all. Simihit. You're not the only one. -I, too... -Not another word. Even if you don't know, even if you don't say, your eyes tell me so. A while ago, you said, "What's the use?'' Now you want to speak. We shouldn't have come to this. I have important plans. More than your heart? I pity you. It's not your heart I'm worried about. It's as pure as this desert sand. It's your head that is full of idle fancies. Let's not go back together. Wait here a while. Stop it! The moon is bewitching tonight. I'm intoxicated by the smell of jasmine. Come to me. Take me in your arms. Why are you provoking me now after ten years? You devoted yourself to Amon. Why the sudden change of heart? Why carry on the pretence? Why did you accept it in the first place? I've never kept things from you, even before marriage. You saved me from death. I didn't want to disappoint you, so I kept quiet. Seems you kept quiet about a lot of things. You've gone over to the followers of Aton. Of course I knew! You've abandoned the cult of Amon. What else? Am I next? You're ready to get rid of me? I can protect you from everything, except from yourself. Who is it? There's no one. I could take your cruelty, but lies, Simihit? You may leave. Would you rather I cheat on you? That's up to you. The choice is yours. Would you wipe out ten years just like that? She jumps on me like a bird of prey, making me undo three years' work. Let her change religion like she changes dresses, but not me. True, the Princess is a friend. But an artist is entitled to some respect. She's either lost her mind, or she's passionately in love. The Princess is a married woman. Yes, to Commander-In-Chief Amihar. By the way, our leader is looking a lot younger and prettier with dark hair and fiery eyes. Have you seen him? He came with her and he didn't recognize me. He was strangely preoccupied by agriculture. Did he have a foreign accent? I won't hide anything. Since it's you, I shall tell all. Scram! You too! Look out! Houri's here! If your husband had intervened, we'd have wiped them out in a flash. He has his own mind. I can't influence him. Has he also abandoned us and gone over to Aton? That'd be a big mistake! Can't he see that the crown prince is not yet ready to take power? A treacherous general spells death. But a treacherous foreign woman we adopted and introduced to our highest circles would suffer unbearable torture. If I didn't go after them, they would have taken over the palace by now. They would have thrown us to the peasants. And Amihar acts meekly. Meekly? On the contrary. No one's more manly. I didn't say "meek.'' I said he "acts'' meekly. Hamobab should replace him. -Not that snob! -Sentimoun then. An idiot! Is Amihar irreplaceable? -Why not Nefer? -He's totally decrepit! Then there's nobody left but me. I thank you for your trust in me and I promise you that the sect of Aton will soon be just a bad memory. You'll burn their fields. Is that it? And their houses, the whole country if I have to. Let's go. I'll show them! The rats who dare defy my authority! Burn their fields! Burn their houses! Burn them all! Let us stay here. The people have risen up. Amon is no more. We're assembling in the square. Help me. I'm wounded. Oh, god. Run for it! Amihar's troops are attacking! Amihar betrayed the rebels? Do you think he's coming to pamper them? Look at that! We'll bear with Houri for a while, but let's remain vigilant. You came here to farm, so what are you doing with these louts? I'd punish you if you were one of us. Strange that after I've farmed Egypt's soil and spent years here, someone says, "If you were one of us." -We're all God's children. -They're sons of bitches. All they think about is seizing power. When my brothers fought, my father would say... Leave your father out of this. -I'm busy with these charlatans. -But you protect them. And your army restrains the rebels. Right away I knew you were impertinent... but honest. Because you want to be one of us, I shall explain. Rest assured, the army doesn't answer to Houri. If I don't stop the rebels, Houri's guards will crush them. -So you're... -You should stop oversimplifying things. So you yourself are in danger. Keep me close to you. -You'll protect me? -Just trust me. Ozir told me how loyal you were. Go back to your room. Tell Zokla these are my orders. Please let me stay. -I'm afraid that tonight... -Have no fear. I'm not afraid of the dark. Go. No, go that way. Houri knows no bounds. Life slips away before we savor it. I'm not asking for your love. Just take me. Ram! Don't humiliate me. Simihit, there's nothing wrong with needing someone. He tried, and I... Go back to your room. I'll be close by. Ram, answer me honestly. -Do you love her? -She's an admirable woman. Have you wanted her? In my dreams, yes. A strong, desirable young man who knows she loves him. -Did you take her? -I respect you and your rights. I'm impotent. Didn't you know? Well then, what rights? Nothing gets in the way of love. And I love her... deeply. How can you say you love her? You saved her life, but deprive her of her happiness. And her happiness... -is that you? -Nothing happened. Didn't she try anything? As I said, she's an admirable woman. Then you're not a real man. You dodge around to hide what you haven't got. What's a real man in your book? An insensitive monster who'd stab his father in the back? It's what you aren't. I must hold my tongue. May I go? Whatever you do, you'll go to prison. Not for lack of loyalty, you're just too stupid! You're just in time. -You wouldn't dare. -Watch me. Before you get in too deep, get your own house in order. Starving the people disgusts me. What greatness of spirit. Why is the commander doing that? Throwing you in jail to save his honor. What honor might that be? He should've protected himself. You were weak, that's not a problem. A slave drools at his woman and you cut his throat? Isn't it enough that he's starving? -Who? -Who are you talking about? Mind your own business! Get out! You too! Go on! All of you, get out! I never drooled. There's nothing between us. And even if there were, who could blame such a poor, frustrated woman? Thousands of men want her. What made her choose the one man who couldn't and wouldn't? You're very harsh. Forget all that now. We've got other concerns. Let's flee. Berri's waiting for us at the land. The coast is clear. The poor have tricks up their sleeves. Large families can be useful. The jailer is my uncle. Come on, quick! If I escape, I'll be admitting guilt. It's true, nothing happened between you. I'd have rather left Egypt with my head held high, my task completed, at peace with everybody. Do you intend to go back home? Do I intend to? I belong to them. I'd give up the world to be with you. You'd accept a vile creature? -A coward? -If that's you, then yes. And I'll shout it out loud. Everyone already knows. And Amihar has received threats. Such loyalty. Simihit. If ever you felt some affection on my part, don't blame me. Blame it on your beauty. So... you have felt love for me. -It wasn't just me. -And I'll love you forever. A small place in your heart, that's all I ask for. It'll be our secret. I have only one thing to declare. Ram is innocent. To put it more simply, I offered myself to him and I don't regret it. But he refused. Berri! At last! Heavens above! It's a disaster! We'll all starve to death. We must close the borders! So Egypt becomes an oasis surrounded by starving millions. My son is wise, but we must find a solution. I've found them! Berri, come here. -I feel so good here! -I'm not going back to Thebes. Instead of enlisting peasants in the army, let's inverse the roles. Let's use soldiers, the whole army, for three years to farm the land. We'll beat the drought. And leave our borders open? Strange idea. Your wife is an excellent cook, Ram. Bring her with you to Thebes. The army is yours for five years. I know you can do it. We'll have to step up the pressure. We have no strength left. The Nile is temperamental. There's either floods or droughts. It's a surprise every seven years. What's going on? Where are you taking them? To build Aton's new city. Sort out the famine first. It's up to us Egyptians to decide on our priorities. I see. "Us Egyptians.'' Men from Tonay are here. Four years of drought have destroyed our animals. Our father, our children, all of us will soon die. All our animals are dead. We've each got dozens of children. We live off weeds and roots. Where's your father? Our father's name is Adam, friend and servant of God. -Is he well? -He's 100 years old and still alive. -How many of you are there? -Seven. Eight. -I only see six. -The youngest is... -Where? -With the camels. Why? Is he your servant? No, it's a tradition. He's the youngest. You're welcome to eat with me tonight. Bring your young brother. Go on. If I were you, I'd make them cut each other's heads off. Every last one of them. You said there were eight of you. Where's the other one? He drowned at sea when he was just a boy. Be seated. Out of the way! -Is this your seat? -Go find another place to sit. You're Salem. -Are you their brother? -By another mother. There were two of us. Ram drowned when I was young. Do you remember him? -You still remember him? -Of course. Father and I keep talking about him. And after all these years, he is still as alive as you are now. His face is engraved in my memory, as handsome as a full moon. By now he must be old and wrinkled. No. As handsome as a full moon. Would you like me as a brother? -Who wouldn't? But... -But in your heart... no one can replace him. Look at me. I have a secret to tell you. I am your brother. I am Ram. I'll buy him in exchange for grain. -Our brother! -Our brother! Ever since Salem's brother died, our father has cried his heart out. What brother? You've even forgotten his name. Follow me. Whoever disobeys me will not leave here alive. What? Take the sword. Be brave. Every head you cut off will add to your share. Take me instead of Salem. I'm the eldest. My children and I will be your servants. Why this show of affection this time? Aren't you the people from Tonay who throw their children away? You raise them in dirt and ignorance, living each day as it comes like animals. And if anyone uses his head, he becomes an enemy, or is left to rot in a ship's hold. Why this show of affection this time? Ram! Ram! I am Ram. He's my brother, Salem. You're Noman. Obeid? No. You're Obeid. Let him go! You're Nadah. And you're Hosban. You're Tobal. And you... you are Gader, my eldest brother. How could you leave me to rot in a hold? Ram! Egypt has fulfilled me. All I know comes from here. All those I love, too. And you, Ram, haven't you thought about how much we'll miss you? My father's getting old. I must see him again. Farewell, Ram. I won't forget you. I won't forget you. -Have you packed their clothes? -Yes. Take them. -Is everything ready? -Yes. Let's go. Zefira. I told you that God loves me. I dreamt of Ram. You were standing there... No, there. There. The jug of water was there. I was very hungry. I raised my head. I looked up and saw... I saw a caravan. At its head, in a blue tunic, was... Ram! My boys are back! No! I dreamt of Ram, not of the children! I dreamt of Ram, not of the children! Ram in a blue tunic. I dreamt of Ram. -Ram! -Father!
