(uplifting music) (light drumming music) (solemn trumpet music) (audience applauding) - If you go back to where I began, and you think of those three deaths and what they meant to your life and how difficult it is to believe that all three were the work of three separated, isolated, lone gunmen. But even if you accept that, think of it as the coming of tragedy into American life for the first time since the 19th century Civil War. Think of what that tragedy means in terms of our own diminishment. My friend Jack Newfield, who was with me during the time of the killing of Robert Kennedy, said, "With that death our generation became might-have-beens, (gun banging) doomed forever to live, never to know what might have been of our lives and of our country's lives." We can debate whether John Kennedy would've gotten out of Vietnam. I happen to think he would have. We can debate whether Robert Kennedy would've expanded a non-violent struggle to include poverty as well as civil rights. I think he would've. We can debate whether Robert Kennedy might've been the nominee and would've defeated Richard Nixon in 1968. I happen to think that he would have. But it doesn't matter what you think. These are our projections based on our best analysis, based on all we know. It doesn't matter what conclusion we draw about the hypothetical. What we do know is that our lives were wrecked. (solemn music continues) And to think that three deranged killers, one dead, two in jail, are responsible for this wreckage, it simply makes no sense to me and I know it makes no sense to most people in this country. - There's no political left left in American politics. The right determines who will live in the White House. The left determines who will be head of the English department. It's like Lyndon Johnson said, "You don't have to worry about the left. They'll never pick up a gun. It's the right you have to worry about. If they don't get what they want, they'll blow your fucking head off." The only people approved for listening to in this society are millionaires. - Is everything okay? - [Elizabeth] Yeah. - Yes, yes, wonderful, thanks. - I know who you are. I've seen you on a talk show. - Oh, it's always good to hear from the younger generation. - [Waitress] You're a great filmmaker. - You must be a millionaire in order to be listened to in this society. I mean, Bush, Quail, Arsenio, Schwarzenegger, Ross Perot, Dan Rather, they're all millionaires. And if you don't share their millionaire's notion of reality, why, you're a wacko. I mean, you're impotent, you're irrelevant. Why, you're even ill mannered. You're hungry. You could be uninsured, you could be homeless. But really it doesn't really matter because nobody's listening. - [Reporter] Despite the slippage in the president's popularity this winter, George Bush is starting to suggest that the economy is actually in better shape than people think. - [George] Most people would say that 2% growth is not recessionary. And there's some areas that are still hurting but clearly this is a good sign and there are a lot of other good signs. - [Reporter] Of course, the upbeat economic news is moderate and Republican strategists are wary of claiming outright via the end of the recession. - What are you doing? (gun clicks) - Just thinking. - About what? Getting a new television set? - No. About what Lyndon Johnson said. He said, "You'd never have to worry about the left 'cause they'd never pick up a gun." He wasn't wrong. - It's not true. The weathermen planted bombs all over the place. - And who'd they kill? Nixon, Reagan, Bush. Our radicals were not killers. They were desperate hippies. When the hippies lost, they became yuppies. The legacy of the '60s was don't fuck with the real powers or you'll get shot. - Arthur, that's history. Nobody's interested in history but school teachers. - Yeah, but suppose Johnson was right just about his own time. Suppose everything that's happened since then finally woke somebody up, created an assassin from the left. Someone who is willing to return fire. - I'll be damned if I'm gonna rollover for a lot of- - There are an awful lot of angry people out there, all on the edge. One little push and that could happen. - You're starting to make me nervous, Arthur. - Think about it. Change the course of history, bend the political wheels of November, all with a piece of metal no bigger than my little finger. Fascinating, isn't it? - Fascinating? Are you crazy? Do you know what you're talking about? - Relax. It's just a movie. - [Elizabeth] A what? - [Reporter] They are relatively insulated from the devastation. - A movie. (plane whooshing) ("Hail to the Chief") There he is, here he comes, here he comes. Make sure you got him in camera, Elizabeth. - [Elizabeth] This is probably illegal. - [Arthur] Exhilarating is a much better word for it. Make sure you got him in frame. (soft tense music) - [Elizabeth] He is the real president. - [Arthur] He's a public figure and this is art. It has to be real or it won't mean anything. - And lost inventory. Homeowners and renters are also eligible for assistance under SBA- - [Arthur] Can you see me, Elizabeth? It's not fine! Lean in. Here. Up, up, over here. Good. Good. Good, pan with him over to the right until you pick me up. (plane whooshing) - [Elizabeth] Is your man supposed to get away? - [Arthur] How do you know it's a man? - [Elizabeth] A woman assassin? - Assassins can come in all sexes. For example, Sarah Jane Moore missed because somebody pushed her arm and Squeaky Fromme, she didn't know how to cock the gun. If Rockefeller would've been president, he would've died later in office. Think of the chaos that that would've had for the Republicans. - [Elizabeth] Is this a movie about assassination or about anarchy? - It's about revenge. They killed our guys, now we kill theirs. - [Elizabeth] We? So this is a conspiracy. - What do you think we're doing right now? - [Elizabeth] But we're only making a movie. You said that's what we were doing. - Of course. But we still are conspirators. It doesn't matter who pulls the trigger because he's still our creation. What? What are you doing? What are you staring at me like that for? Aim it back at the president. What are you doing? Pan up at him! - [Elizabeth] You don't want an actor. You want a nut! - Why do I have to do the dirty work all the time? Can't you do this for me once in a while? Can't you handle this for Daddy? (baby giggles) Huh? (phone ringing) ♪ Do, do, do, do, do, do, do ♪ ♪ Do-do, do-do, do, do, do ♪ ♪ Do-do, do-do, do, do, do ♪ ♪ Do, do, do, do, do, do ♪ ♪ Do, doodly-do, do, do, do, do, do ♪ ♪ Do-do, doodly-do, do, do, do, do, do ♪ Lorina, what are you doing? Get the phone. - [Lorina] I'm taking a fucking suds bath. What do you think I'm doing? - You know you'd better stop cursing like that. She's gonna know what you're saying and I don't want her bringing that to school. - Hello? Oh yes, this is Lorina. - Hi, Miss Rosebowl. - He's right here. - Here, here's an effin' apple for you. - I'm fine. Thank you. It's Arthur Gwenlyn. - What the fuck does he want? (jaunty music) - Hey, Duggo. How are you doing? - Hey Arthur. Long time no see. - Yeah, yeah, great. I got a new picture I'm doing. I'm very excited about it. - Oh yeah? That sounds real good. - That wasn't Latina, was it? - Lorina. - Lorina, sorry. Right. Boy, her English has really picked up since the last time I saw you. She go to school or what? - Yeah, she picked it all up from me. (soft music) So what's up? I know you didn't just call to say hello. Uh-huh. - [Lorina] What does he want? Is it a job? - From who, Arthur Gwenlyn, the last communist? - [Lorina] Come on. Don't tease me like that, okay? Is he going to try to make your life story again? (soft music) - No, he just wants me to help him shoot the President. - [Lorina] Of the United States? - [Duggo] No, of Burger King. - Burger King? Why he wants to shoot him? - He's a whack job. He wants to stalk Bush around. - [Lorina] You mean like follow him? - Yeah, follow him. You know, just to see if it can be done. - [Lorina] You can't do that. You have a baby. - I don't want you to do that even if you don't have a baby. - Is he serious? - It's a movie, Lorina. - What, like "JFK?" - Yeah, like "JFK." - How much you get paid? - Hey, don't get your hopes up. Remember, Hollywood is full of shit. (jaunty music) - Pull. (gun bangs) I like it. But does it have to be the president? - [Arthur] Of the United States, yes. - Load this. You know, why can't it be some Banana Republic dictator or maybe Saddam Hussein? - He's not the enemy. - Oh. You know, this is, you're gonna cause a lot of political trouble here. I'm best friends with Arnold, okay? He's close to Bush. I get Christmas cards from the White House. - They'll blame me not Robert Davi. - They're not gonna see you, Arthur. They're gonna see me. - I can't get the money without you. You're the only actor that doesn't bullshit me. - There are no actors, only actresses. How much are you gonna need to cowboy this whole thing? - Without you? - Yeah. - As much as you can manage. (jaunty music continues) I'll pay you back with interest. - Did you see "JFK?" - No, I didn't. But you know, I believe there was a conspiracy and the conservatives were responsible for it. You know, just like, like you. - Oh, that's good, Duggo. We need someone with your expertise to make this thing believable. This is gonna be very real. - You got a name for this movie? - It's called "Cross Point." It's cause it's like the cross point in this guy's life and like the cross hairs on a gun. - Yeah but I mean, do you have a name, you know, a star. (jaunty music continues) - Oh, no. I'm gonna use all unknowns in this film. - All unknowns. So what's your budget? - Well, it's kind of low, you know? It's a personal movie. - Uh-huh. So, how much can you pay me? - Hey, I did mean to insult you. How about 250 a week? - You forgot to say asshole. How about 250 a week, asshole? - Look, this isn't Hollywood bullshit. I'm trying to stay on a tight budget so I don't have some fucking studio telling me what I can say. It's guerilla filmmaking and I'm giving you a chance to be part of it. - I wanna be with gorillas, I'd go to the zoo. - All right, I'll give you part of the profits. - Profits of what? The fucking Secret Service is gonna throw you and the film in jail as soon as they find out about this. So you want me, you pay me up front. Put 10 large on the table and we talk. - What's 10 large? - [Duggo] Large. Thousands. - 10,000? I don't have 10,000. - Then how you gonna make this movie if you don't have 10,000? - I'm blowing up 16 millimeter. Most of my expenses are deferments. - And I drove three hours for this? (soft music) Now, let me tell you something. I did see "JFK" and anybody who believes it's real is a kook. You goddamn liberals are all kooks. That's why I'm a conservative. And I voted for Bush. So go and fuck yourself. (dramatic music) - I would shoot the President of the United States. It wouldn't be that hard. All you need is a gun and a willingness to exchange your life for his. I have that willingness. I'm dying anyway. - [Arthur] Why are you dying? - I have AIDS. - [Arthur] I'm sorry to hear that. How did you get it? - I don't think that matters to you. - No, I'm sorry. That was a stupid question. Are you upset with the President about how little he's done to help you? - Well, yeah. You know, me and a million other people. I mean, Bush has really got... Could we stop for a minute here? - [Arthur] Something wrong? - Yeah, I'm starting to get scared. - [Arthur] Scared? Scared of what? - I mean, what if someone was to see this tape? - What do you mean what if? It's my every intention that everyone will see this tape. - Wait a minute. You're gonna really use Bush's name in this script, aren't you? - He uses it. Why shouldn't I? - Why can't we change Bush to something else? I mean, let's call him Tree or Shrub or something. - You don't have AIDS. - What? - The ad said actors who really have AIDS should apply. You lied. - (clears the throat) All right, look, I need this job. I can play this part. What's the difference on screen? - Thanks very much for coming by. - Boy, you are really fucking weird, man. Really fucking weird. - He's right. - I'm not fucking weird. Maybe he's talking about you. - An opportunity for an actor who has AIDS to get a chance to work is one thing. But if we can't find the right actor, what's wrong with someone just playing the part? I mean, it's all the same on screen. - We agreed to make this real or not to make it at all. Let's not start by cheating on what we believe in. I mean, if you really care about the oppressed, I mean, if you really wanna change things for them, why don't you give one of 'em an opportunity he might not get on his own? - [Elizabeth] That's when I knew he wasn't talking about making a movie. I saw it in his eyes. He was looking for someone to really shoot the President of the United States. - Last week. A car accident. No, she's dead too. I'm his brother and I can't talk anymore, all right? - Who is you talking to? - You scared the shit out of me. What the fuck is wrong with you? - Shut up! You'll wake the baby. I heard you telling somebody we was dead. Who was you talking to? - They were trying to sell something. - Bullshit. It was a collection agency, okay? - No. - [Lorina] It was. - [Duggo] I said it wasn't, didn't I? - Don't use those forks. I saved them for company. Give it to me I said. - You want the fork? You want the fork? Here's your fucking fork! All right? - You bastard. (Lorina crying) You break my fork. I love these forks. They are a part of my wedding present. - I'll get you another fork. - I don't want another fork. - Give me the fork. I can fix it. - You can't fix it. It's broke. - I can fix it. Here. (baby crying) Here, look. See? (soft music) - [Elizabeth] He keeps interviewing every kind of radical he can find. He admits he's not even looking for actors anymore. He tells them he's making a movie about shooting the President. He found some real dangerous people. But I don't think he settled on anybody yet. When he finds the them, he'll tailor the script around that person's life and push him or her right over the edge. Clever, isn't it? I mean, he's using the movie idea to make his own assassin right out in the open. He keeps rewriting the script as he goes along. Whatever happens in real life, he steals and puts into the movie or the plan or whatever you wanna call it. - We have refrigerator. - Well then you don't need one. - Why do you need a security deposit? There is nothing we can break here. - I gotta have it. I can help split up for it. But you gotta put it up. - Look, it's just us and the baby and we're not wild or something. We don't have parties or dog or cat. - You can have a dog or a cat. - [Lorina] Well, we don't. - You can have a fish or a bird. You know the small ones. They don't talk. - We don't have money for fish or bird. - [Landlord] You on welfare? - What? - [Landlord] The welfare puts up the security. - We don't take welfare. - You wanna look at the single? - A single? We have a baby. - Well, I don't know what to tell you. It's up to you. (sirens wailing in distance) (soft music) - You feel you're walking on time bombs waiting for one to go off. Like this guy Vincent Duggo. Somebody wrote a book about his life. In that book he says that in combat, men dropped death from planes or fired it from artillery and never saw their victims. But not Duggo. He was a sniper in Vietnam. He depended mostly on not leaving any trace of where he was. (soft music continues) So he can hide in one place for days, just waiting for the right time. If he had to pee, he did it right in his pants. He holds one of the highest confirmed numbers of kills in the war. Arthur was supposed to make the book into a movie, but the deal fell through and Duggo drifted from job to job then back into the Marines. I guess he didn't know how to do anything else. When Arthur called Duggo to be a technical advisor, he didn't know he'd been discharged from the Marines, and that he'd lost his house 'cause he couldn't pay the mortgage. He lives in some dump with his family. He had to come back to Arthur just to keep them with groceries. That cold-hearted son of a bitch just wrote it in the script. I thought about leaving him, but I was frightened. He is going to kill the President. If he suspected I knew, what would stop him from killing me too? Do you mind? - How did you get that close to the President at the airport? - Arthur is a very clever man. - This ain't no joke, lady. You understand this? You're in the hottest shit you ever stepped in. - You're forgetting I came to you. - (chuckles) That's because you're not stupid. We photographed you at the airport. You two clowns stood out like a 3D movie. You saw somebody was taking your picture, didn't you? - No, I didn't. - This script, it's not finished. How does he plan to turn it into the real thing? - I don't know that part. - [Agent] Why not? You know everything else. - How can I ask him? He doesn't know I know about it. - Well, I guess we're gonna have to pay close attention to the making of this movie, aren't we? - What do you mean? You're not gonna stop him? (soft music) - No, not yet. Oh, I can watch him very closely. I can even detain him as a possible threat when the President comes to the city. See, there's no law against making a movie about an assassination. - This is not a movie. It's real. - Yeah, but I can't prove that in court. That is, not without some help. - No, no. No, I would be too frightened. - Oh no, no. You'll be just fine. You do whatever he tells you to do and then you tell me what that is. You pick his brain. You'll be a sounding board. He's got to slip up sometime. If we don't get him right, he'll always be out there. And I don't like that idea at all. Don't be afraid. I'll always be with you. - Hallelujah. I'm saved. (soft music continues) (helicopter whirring) - [Arthur] That's amazing! - I know. Okay, I will mold a C4 high explosive on the bottom. The only thing I need to know is where and when the President will be. - Why can't I shoot it down? - Shoot it down? You wouldn't even see it in time, let alone hit it. - I'll get back with you on this. - Okay. - Okay. Cut it, cut it. That was incredible. The way it came down was amazing. Amazing. - Are we breaking down the camera? - Great, great. - How's the acting? - Great. Was that good for the camera? - Yeah, very good. - Okay, sound? - That was fine. - All right, did you get a boom in there? Was a boom in? - No boom, I'm sure. - I don't know. - I have to find a number to go along with this can. - Is my accent very heavy? - You don't have an accent. - Oh. - [Elizabeth] Scott, was the last number 62? - Look, I don't wanna cut my own throat over here, but I don't know what you need me for. (Lahoud speaking foreign language) - [Arthur] What are you talking about? - The Air Force flies a Black Hawk helicopter wherever the president is. It jams radio frequencies for miles. That thing would spin around like a toy and drop right back in your lap. - You're absolutely right. Okay, that was much too theatrical. That's why I have you as my technical advisor. Next time we'll give them rifles. - It's why those morons lost the war. (tense music) - [Elizabeth] Where in hell were you? You were just supposed to get a Photo Cam and come back. - [Staff] I went to Photo Cam and then I went to Magic Filmworks and then I went to Kohling. - Yeah, right. - I had to help Donna and I had to help Lisa. (tense music continues) - Hey, I could use some help over here. (upbeat rock music) (toilet flushing) (knocking on door) (knocking on door) - Yes? - Yeah, look, I live down the hall and I was- (neighbor screams) (Greg speaking foreign language) - Yeah, I live down the hall. I wanted, the music. (Greg speaking foreign language) - (speaking foreign language) You know, sleep. (Greg speaking foreign language) (upbeat rock music continues) (knocking on door) - Didn't I tell you to quit knocking on the door, retard? - Turn it down. My baby's sleeping. - Fuck you and your baby. Come on, motherfucker. You wanna die? - Not today. I'll let you know when. - Well, I'll be right here, asshole. Turn the fucking radio up. - [Arthur] Hm. I don't know if Duggo's thinking right. This thing's gotta be lighter. Something. - Hey, excuse me. What does this look like, a Sears? I don't do no exchanges. You don't wanna shoot it, use it for plumbing. - Okay, okay, when do we get the rest of this gun? - When I get it, I call you. Same thing with the scope, which by the way hasn't been that easy. - [Arthur] Okay, when you call us, we'll send a guy to pick it up. - You know I get a lot of things for people. I even got a tank for a guy once, but he looked like he belonged in a tank. What I don't get is you and this piece together. So what are you gonna do with this? - Deer. - That's not a gun. That's artillery. You hit a deer with that thing, you won't find an antler to put on a wall. - Why don't you tell him the truth? It's for a movie. - A movie? Oh shit, a movie? - Right. This gun will never be fired. - [Gun Shop Owner] Hey, I'm an actor. Can I be in your movie? - [Arthur] Sorry. We're all cast up. - [Gun Shop Owner] I'll make a deal with you on the gun. - [Arthur] Maybe next time. - [Gun Shop Owner] You're full of shit about a movie. (drill instructor yodeling) - [Drill Instructor] Left, right, left, right. Left, right, left. (drill instructor yodeling) (knocking on door) - Sergeant Major, can I see you a minute? - Yeah, what is it? Hey, Duggo. The hell are you doing here? Here, give me a hand here. - Yes, sir. - I was wondering if I could see you in private a minute. - Well this is as private as you'll ever catch me. What's on your mind? - I need to come back. I gotta come back. I came to ask you if you'll make a phone call for me. Maybe CMC, maybe, I don't know, anybody that can help. - Pizza's hell, ain't it? (helicopter whirring in distance) You wait a year, you'll be back in that sandbox. Come and see me then. - I can't wait that long. - What's your hurry? Take some time off. Relax. - I don't belong out there. I don't deserve what happened to me. - Draw down got a lot of good men. - [Duggo] Yeah, sure did. A lot of good men. - Oh, what makes you so special? - Nothing. They're all thinking like me. - What the hell's that supposed to mean? - Means we got the shaft with no Vaseline. - Get the fuck outta here before I have you arrested for trespassing on government property. - I'm a Marine. - Then do what you have to to survive like one. Nothing harder to survive than not being needed anymore. ♪ Proud are we ♪ ♪ For total respect ♪ ♪ Proud are we ♪ ♪ For total respect ♪ ♪ Pick a fight for blood we shed ♪ - Semper Fi, Sergeant Major. - Yeah, Semper Fi, Marine. (audience cheering) - I'll be damned if I'm gonna roll over for a lot of these outrageous charges that are coming out of the opposition day in and day out. We don't have to take that. (audience applauding) (tense music) - [Arthur] And that's where I want you to be. - [Sibby] Where are you gonna be? - [Arthur] That's all you gotta know. Everybody knows just what they have to. - Now you wouldn't be trying to trick me, now would you, G? - What do you mean trick? - I mean, how come I feel like this ain't no movie no more, man, but somebody forgot to tell me. - Then I must be doing something right. That's what you're supposed to feel. - I know how you told me how you was going to pull it all together, but lemme tell you what else pulls together, homeboy. See, it pulls together that I really am African American. It pulls together that Bush really is the President. And it pulls together that I really don't like him. And if he was to get shot, really, and I happen to be in the wrong place at the right time, I could make a really cool patsy. - You have a perfect imagination. If that's what you think, why are you here? - Because if I'm right, this thing is a whole lot bigger than you and me and somebody I've been knowing for 20 years is liable to come over to my house and smoke me. But if I'm wrong, I'm out a chance of becoming a really famous actor. (jaunty music) - Well I have to know now. Are you in or are you out? - Yo man, I just hope you need me for part two. (soft music) - You wanna come in with me? - No, I better wait here. - Okay. I'll just be a minute. (doorbell rings) (curious music) (toy car whirring) (curious music continues) (tense music) - You know, he's the one to worry about. - Gwenlyn's the one to worry about it. We'll take care of Duggo when the time is right. - He's coming out. (camera shutter clicks) (camera shutter clicking) (gentle lullaby music) ♪ Goodnight ♪ ♪ My little one ♪ ♪ Sleep, dear ♪ ♪ A song ♪ ♪ Shine on your ray of love ♪ ♪ Sleep ♪ (tense music) - [Elizabeth] You planning to shoot from here? - [Arthur] Didn't I tell you? - You don't really tell me much of anything anymore, Arthur. - I'm sorry. I got a lot of my mind. Yeah, we'll shoot from up here. - When? - When the President comes here, the motorcade will most probably come right down there. - What if it doesn't? - Wherever it is, that's where I'll be. He can't hide from me. - When do I get to see the rest of the script? I mean, I need to know what to prep. - I'm doing all the prep. The rest of the script is up here. You just be where I need you to be doing what I tell you to do. - What about security, Arthur? I mean, how are you gonna get around that? - It's not as hard as you think. The answer's right in front of you. Would you like to see it? - No, I don't wanna see it. I thought I did, but I really don't want to. - Why not? - Arthur, what would it take for you to give this whole thing up? - What? - It's winter in Chile. The skiing's great. I'll pay for two weeks at Las Lena's. I mean, it'll be wonderful, Arthur. You'll forget about all this. - Is there something wrong with you? (knocking on door) Who could that be? Latina. - Lorina. - [Arthur] Right, sorry, Lorina. How did you find me here? - I've got to talk to you. I'm leaving my husband. - Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. - I think it's better for him. He tell me he wish he don't have me or the baby to worry about no more so he can die. He tell me it is a dream he has, that one time he kill us. - Well that's because he still wants you. His dream is his way of escaping responsibility. It's totally normal. - Killing your family is normal? You've got to take Vincent off this movie. - [Arthur] Off the movie? - There is a lot of things you don't know about him. - [Elizabeth] Like what? - Like some of the things he's been doing A couple of weeks ago, we were in the apartment and he was playing with the baby the way he always does. You know that, do, do, do, do-do, do-do, do-diddly, do, do, do, do do, do, do. He keeps doing it and doing it. I laugh and I say, "Daddy's crazy, isn't he? (tense music) You got quarters for the laundry?" But he never answered. I start to get scared. His eyes were far away someplace. Stop it, Venny. What are you doing? You know what he said to me? "I just want her to laugh." Then last week after he brings home the rifle, he did something else. He put cammy stick on his face. When I ask him why he's doing that, he said to me, "It's for the movie." - But Lorina, I don't see anything wrong with his getting into what he's doing. - He thinks that people follow him all the time. - What people? - I don't know. Men. He says they're from the defend department. - [Arthur] You mean the Department of Defense? - Yeah, that one. - Arthur, can't you see? She's not asking you. Take him off the goddamn picture. - What for? - Do you know why he's not in Marines? - Something to do with the military drawdown. - He had one years to go before he can retire. And the military is making excuses not to pay benefits to a lot of soldier. They say they overweight or bad business report or something stupid like that. - You guys are getting squeezed out just like the rest of America is getting squeezed out. That's what this whole movie is about. It's a catharsis for the American nobody. - No what? - A cleansing. This country is sick and it needs to be cleaned out. - You want to make a cleaning movie, but maybe Duggo wants to do it real. - [Arthur] What? - Sometimes he say is President's fault. On the secret, he blame him. He thinks that Bush, how does he say? - Betrayed the Marines? - Yeah. - Where is he now? - Maybe he come home and get my note. (Duggo crying) (rock music) (rock music continues) - Duggo isn't paranoid. The men following him are real. - Yeah. Who are they? - They're the Secret Service. - Secret Service? How do you know that? - Oh damn you, Arthur. Why are you doing this? You are never gonna get away with it. They've known from the start. - Getaway with what? - Don't insult me. I know that you're planning to kill the President. - You must be losing your mind. - I am not losing my mind. - Well then I'm losing mine! First an Afro-American actor who says he's not an actor, comes to me and says, I'm gonna kill him if he doesn't play the role. Then Latina, I wish she'd change her name, Lorina comes and says my tech advisor's flipping out and now you come and tell me I'm really out to kill Bush and the Secret Service knows it. - You're not? - [Arthur] Oh shit. This is a meat wagon. - [Elizabeth] Oh I hope he wasn't depressed enough to kill himself. - [Arthur] He's not the type. - [Elizabeth] Oh, and just who is the type? - Residents only. You live here? - [Arthur] No, no, but a friend of mine does. - You'll have. to wait outside. - Was anybody hurt? - Step outside the marked area, please. - I'm outside the area. - Fine. (police radio chattering) (neighbor crying) - It looks like the head is missing. - Don't fuck with me. - Found this in the sofa. - I gotta hear what they're saying. - I got a better idea. - It ain't mine. - Man, I ain't seen that stuff before. - Shut up! - It ain't my stuff. - Listen, you twin pieces of shit! Somebody wants to ask you some questions, you'd better have some answers. You got it? - [Police Officer] So did you actually see what happened or was your back turned? - [Suspect] Look at my fucking shirt. Does it look like my back was turned? - Look, asshole. - Fuck you! - [Officer] Standing around in a circle smoking a joint and the window was open. - [Suspect] Yeah, we were sitting facing the window and Greg was facing us. - [Suspect 2] Yeah, you know, we're just like having a good time, right? And I'm, and I'm getting ready to tell Greg, don't burn that sucker too long. All of a sudden I hear this quick kind of like (gun pops) Greg's head fucking head just exploded. - Quit that. Put the mic back. - All right. Thanks very much. - Get these pieces of shit out of here. - All right, let's go, move. - You know, gentlemen, we made a thorough search of the opposite building and there is no place that a sniper can perch himself to that line of trajectory. - Yeah, that seems to be a problem. - And how do you silence a high powered rifle anyway? - Fortunately, Detective, that's your problem, not ours. So you have a nice night. (sirens wailing) - Those guys aren't regular cops. They're Secret Service, aren't they? - Yes. - When? - You saw them taking our picture at the airport and you still wouldn't stop. I thought you'd gone crazy. - Well, that's the end of this movie. - I can talk to them. - What? Tell 'em what? That you made a mistake? - Yes! They only believed what I told them and what they wanted to. I can convince them they're wrong. - You forget I made Duggo a killer. He's my creation, as I said. - Duggo was a killer. You asked for a prop and you got a live grenade. It's not your fault. (police radio chattering) - They'll pick you up tomorrow morning. Tell them you told me everything and I decided to drop the movie. Tell them you know nothing about tonight. (soft music) - Look at me. Do you mean it about the movie? - It's not that important anymore. What matters now is Duggo. - Yes. - I'll get you a cab. You wait by those cops. You'll be safe. - What are you gonna do? - I know where he is. (tense music) Duggo, I know you're up there. I wanna help you. Duggo? (gun clicking) A bullet fired from a high powered rifle can't be silenced because it breaks the sound barrier. So you shoot from far enough away that the sound can't reach the target. You taught me that a long time ago. I'm alone. Can I turn around? (tense music) - The cab driver who dropped you off told us where he picked you up. Now, where's Arthur? - Duggo's sick. Arthur had nothing to do with it. - Oh, I see. - What I believed was my own mistake and my embarrassment. I realize I have a big imagination. He told me I was wrong and I believe him. (tense music) - How'd you know where to find me? - I just followed the line of sight from your building to the highest point. I knew it was up here. I just had to wait till my nerves calmed down. - And what do you want? - I wanna show you how to get outta here. You know, go down this mountain free as a bird. - Yeah. How? - Just walk, same way you came up. - You forgot to say asshole. - No. Nobody knows how you did it. They don't even know it was you. Even those two greasy friends of the guy you killed. They didn't even think of you. Nobody knows. You can go home. - You know. (couple moaning enthusiastically) - You son of a bitch. - Don't be embarrassed, Elizabeth. That's not you. It's the waitress at the Angelique. We thought she might be connected to his plan, but she isn't. Though he did say he was planning to get away for a while. Maybe Chile. He asked her to go with him. She said yes. - Is there something you want? - No. I think of you as a friend. - He lies to you, Elizabeth. - Then why don't you arrest him? - So I need the attempt and I need you to tell me his plan. I don't want to have to worry about Arthur in some other city. - There is not going to be an assassination. So please go get laid. - Would you like to bet he'll tell you he's still gonna make the movie? - I'd love to. What do you wanna bet? - All right guys. That's it. (tense music) Duggo. - What? - You asked me what I wanted to bet. - I don't understand. - He killed a sleazy drug dealer. It's really none of our business. And the locals will never figure it out, but we could help them. - What are you trying to say? - If I'm wrong, I'll be happy to go on my way. I'll forget about Arthur and Duggo can go free. - And if I'm right, you won't have anything on Arthur anyway. And what makes you think I care about Duggo? - Then don't take the deal. - I saw this show once. (soft music) It was a documentary about this wolf pack that these ranchers were chasing with a helicopter. The wolves were killing their cattle. So the ranchers were shooting them down in the snow. The wolves kept running. They were trying to make it to a forest up ahead. But they kept, you know, getting picked off one by one. Finally there was only one wolf left and he kept zigzagging, thinking, ducking, moving. You couldn't help cheering for that son of a bitch to make it. - Well, did he make it? - Yeah, he made it. - [Arthur] Great. I'm glad to hear it. - Why? - Because he lived. He survived. He beat all the odds. It's the part that we like to see in ourselves. That's why you cheered. - And now I'll tell you the part you don't see when the documentary finished. You don't see one of a kind who grows old alone, who struggles to eat because he doesn't know how to hunt without his pack. You don't see the wolf who wondered what he won by living. He would've been better off if he wasn't so good. (helicopter whirring) (tense music) (owl hooting in distance) How'd you like to make the film of a lifetime? If your people were along any route, this would still be the safety perimeter. - Duggo, I've stood next to the President. There's so much power in that spot. You'll never get out alive. (tense music continues) - This is what I want you to do. (helicopter whirring) - November 25, Alpha Juliet to operation. - [Operator] Go ahead November 25, Alpha Juliet. - Still negative contact. I've been a sitting duck out here all morning with no visual. If he's still here, he hasn't taken the bait. - You really believe the Secret Service is gonna forget about Duggo and me? Right! Don't worry about it, Elizabeth. Duggo is my friend. He's more important than my politics. (tense music) We did look a little suspicious. I mean, we saw him take our picture at the airport. But look, hey, it's just a movie. I'm no real threat to the President. I mean, but we're at the airport, There are Secret Service all around us, and I'm going, "Squeaky Fromme, she didn't know how to cock the gun. Sarah Jane Moore, somebody pushed her arm." Okay? I mean, I'm talking about assassinating the President, but I can't say it 'cause all the Secret Service around. So I just keep going on and then we add the sound later. And my cinematographer, Elizabeth, we had that on again, off again relationship. She gets scared. She goes and tells him I'm really gonna kill Bush. Don't get upset. I already handled that. I already straightened it out. I told her to go back and tell 'em I'm not, which I'm really not. This thing is turning out much better than I ever expected. Thank you very much, Mr Davi. (jaunty music) - What? - Duggo will play the main character. - I just finished telling them that we're not making this movie. - No, we're gonna shoot Duggo as his life is happening now. - Arthur, you don't know what you're getting yourself into. - Yes, I do. - Arthur, if you love me, you're gonna quit this. - I do, but I can't. (Arthur grunts) - That's for the waitress! (soft music) (train horn blaring) They'll kill you if you go through with this. - [Duggo] I'm making a movie. Tell them that. - I'm so tired of this shit, Duggo. You can't leave your family like this. - You'll be safe. And this movie will make you the most famous movie photographer in the world. - Can any of you imagine what it would be like to have recorded the real assassination of JFK or Robert Kennedy or Martin Luther King? That's what our movie is gonna look like when we're through. I'm gonna have a shot of each of you and the presidential motorcade all in the same shot. The presidential motorcade will have to slow down when it makes its turn onto Olympic Boulevard, heading south to get to the President's hotel. Sibby will be in the second floor hotel here. Lahoud and Haddad will be in the multi-level garage here, and Duggo will be in the Lowe Apartments on Chesterfield Avenue. Morgana will be located on the corner here, able to signal where everyone can see her when the motorcade passes by the intersection. I'll be at my hotel on the fifth floor. (jaunty music) - Yo man, you'll never get us past security. - You're talking to me. - Yes, but this time we'll have rifles. - No guns. When the President is gone, then we'll come back, we'll shoot closeups where you will have guns. (tense music) - Excuse me. Everybody can read the newspaper and find out what week the President will be here. But nobody, I mean, nobody tell you what day and where he gonna be. So by the time we see it on the news, he already gone. How do you know? - [Haddad] He's not going to tell us that. But why you give us rifle instead of our helicopter? - Duggo said it's not believable. And as for when the president is coming, I told you before we began, I can make this film because I have ways of finding out when the President arrives. And I only give two hours notice. If you don't like it, you guys can try to find out when he comes. I'm gonna have two cameras that day and I'm gonna cover who I need to with the motorcade and when. Except for Sibby. He'll turn on his own camera and sit in front of it as the motorcade goes by. - [Haddad] I still think the helicopter will be better for the audience. - [Arthur] Well you show me how it'll get past that Black Hawk helicopter flying overhead and I'll put it back in. - [Haddad] But, come on. It's only a movie. (knocking on door) - Who knew we are here? - Nobody. We kept everything secret. (knocking on door) - Everybody stay put. - Hey, remember me? - Yeah. You read for us a couple months ago. - That's absolutely right. - How did you find us? - Well, can I come in? Hey, how you doing? - What do you want? - Same thing I wanted before. A job. - I told you you weren't right. - Oh, and you're gonna tell me those people are. I mean, no offense to anybody, but I can do this job as good as any of them. I just need the chance to prove it. - I've already cast the movie. - Look, you think this was easy for me to come down here? I've been busting my to get ass to get a lousy job and I ain't got no luck. I ain't worked in a year. - I'm sorry, but I can't help you. - I got a 14 month old daughter. She's very sick. It's something with her lungs. Now please, goddamn it, I need this job. I need to get my SAG insurance back. I can't afford the bills. I will do anything. - I'm sorry, but I just don't have anything for you to do. - Come on, Arthur. He's got a sick kid. - Come on. I thought we were all liberals here, huh? - Bite your tongue, Miss. - Maybe you could find a way to use him. I mean, isn't that what you're doing with all of us? - Now, look, it doesn't have to be as an actor. I could make a movie of how you made the movie. Just put me under SAG so I can get my insurance. - What do you know about making movies? - I've been taping you all along. - What? - Yeah, I mean, I've been following you every place. I've been on rooftops, climbed trees, been in park vans many a times. You never even knew I was there. - You put my movie on tape? - Well, I mean, the sound isn't that hot, but I heard you and the acting was great. I just kept reaching for popcorn. Oh, and I love that helicopter that's supposed to be carrying C4 explosives and how it's going to ram into the president's limousine. You know, ba-boom! Be a big hole where that car was. - Where is this tape? - Safe. Wouldn't want the Secret Service to get ahold of it. I hear they got a lousy sense of humor. (tense music continues) - What's your name? - Eric. Eric Clancy. I got my picture and resume in the car. - Eight by 10s? - Yep. - Well everybody meet our new documentary maker, Eric. He's gonna make a movie about the making of our movie. (Haddad speaking foreign language) (Lahoud speaking foreign language) (knocking on door) - What? What are you doing? - [Duggo] Why do you hang up on me? - Go away! I don't know where she is. Who are you? - [Duggo] I want my baby. - Get out of here. I don't know where she is. Go away. (Victor speaking foreign language) - Get out of here! - You hiding them from me? Tell me where my family is! (tense music) - [Delia] You're crazy! Go away! I call the police. - Looks like he's going to punch her. I can get him clean right now. - No good. It's gotta be an immediate threat to her life. - Say when and he's yours. (Duggo speaking foreign language) (Delia speaking foreign language) - Hey, watch the camera. - Watch out for me! (dog barking in distance) - Arthur, stop him, will you? - Keep rolling. Keep the camera rolling. - I brought you here. Is this how you pay me back? (Delia crying) - Damn! - Hey, hey. What's up? Not much. Good to see you. - Yeah. - There it is. - Who's name did you use? - Not mine. (laughs) Check it out. This is just like Dallas right here with a twist. (Morgana laughs) Boom! - Did you tell him? - No. He'll go for it. - Yeah man, this looks real nice. - Nice. You can see a fly at 2000 meters and swear he was passing around a few notes. The optics are my own development with a patent pending. - When will it be finished? - Eh, need three more days. Some minor puffing, final calibration test. - See you in three days. - Good. But I'll need the rest of the bread now. - Oh yo, it's COD, homes. - What the fuck is this home? I am not your homie, but I don't know what shit you are up to with this. You might be hunted by the police already. What if you get busted and don't come back? What am I going to do with it? No, I want the rest of my money now or you'll find somebody else to make your fucking- - Hey, hey, yo, look man, all I know is my man told me to come down here and pick it up, okay? I don't pick it up, I don't got no job. - Tell your fucking man to come in himself. - Okay. Okay, that's cool, man. How about we do this? You seen "Marathon Man" motherfucker? - Okay. Okay, COD, homie. COD. - [Arthur] Cut. Good. (jaunty music) - You okay? - Yes, I think you broke my fucking nose. - [Elizabeth] It was very good. I liked it lot. - Thank you. That good for sound? - [Elizabeth] Very good. - [Sibby] Man, that shit was real. - Great, really great. - That really went back like that, man. - I can't believe I didn't break his nose. (all chattering) (tense music) - [Elizabeth] Has anybody seen my lighter? - [Arthur] All right, everybody take about a 10 minute break. I have to make an important phone call. Was that good for you, Duggo? - Yeah. It's only a movie. - Arthur knows the President is coming here to campaign tomorrow. This is his layout for the route. (cheerful carnival music) You only have three choices from the airport. They all have to pass by this point. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. What else? - He thinks he's being set up. - What do you mean set up? - Sibby and Morgana. They're getting very close. Arthur's nicknamed them nitro and glycerin. Harmless alone, but he thinks together they might try something as the motorcade passes tomorrow. - You expect me to believe that Arthur will have nothing to do with this? It was his idea to use the umbrella. - No, it was Morgana's. She thought that it would be great for the movie if they used the President's alma mater as the assassination signal. Arthur agreed. But now he thinks Morgana really may be trying to signal Sibby. - Come on. Can't you see he's using you? - Look who's talking! - Hey, thanks pal. - Hey, didn't you forget something? - What? - Did you wanna pay me? - Oh, shit. Oh, I'm sorry. I got a lot on my mind today. How much I owe you? - Nine even. - Nine even. - You want a hand with that? - No, no, no. I got it, I got it. (vendor whistles) - Secret. You're with Secret Service? - Yep. That is no secret to you, huh? 10. Keep the change. - Hey, thanks a lot. Hey look, I got a 20 here I got from this guy. It looks a little funny. - No, no, no. Don't show me that 20. If that 20 is bad, I gotta keep it. You try the bank. If the bank don't catch it, they eat it. - Right. Hey, thanks a lot. (Eric laughing) - That son of a bitch is setting me up to be the patsy. Can you imagine that? I mean, what makes him think I wouldn't catch on? (tense music) - I don't know. He must be crazy. - Now, the part that gets me the most is he didn't even care I told him I had a sick baby. That son of bitch a didn't care about anything. - What makes you think you're the patsy? - Well, it's pure Oswaldism. - It's what? - It's pure Oswaldism. - Which means what? - Well we know he's motivated by some sick kind of revenge, right? And he believes Oswald's a patsy set up by the real killers. So he's gonna create his own Oswald. You know, he's gonna follow the Warren Report like a fucking mandate, you know, use it like some kind of poetic justice. He's gonna push Duggo into shooting the President, letting him believe he can get away with it while Gwenlyn sets up some lone nut to take the fall. You know, some obsessed actor who flipped out from his movie. He used to be one of the others before. Now it's me. Oh. I managed to borrow this from wardrobe. Look at that. - Sure. That's the modern day Oswald. (tense music continues) - Quite an image for the news, huh? - Yeah. Probably get more air play than the Rodney King video. - And you can bet that that's the rifle that Duggo's gonna use. Now listen, Chief, you gonna eat that dog? - She blinks when she lies. - What? - Elizabeth. I can tell by her eyes if she's telling the truth, and I've been studying her very closely. - Chief, the key here is distance. We know that about Duggo. Everything else is a diversion. - Just a slight blink. - [Arthur] He wanted to know where Duggo would be. He wasn't interested in anybody else. - That's what I expected. - Do you really think you're being set up, or did you just want me to tell that to Granger? - Sibby's tripod's thick enough to convert one of the legs into a rifle. - Then why don't you ask to see it? - If I'm right, you think he'd let me with the President coming tomorrow? It's funny, when I first met him, he was the one who didn't trust me. You still don't trust me. I mean, not really. Do you? (tense music) (device beeping) - Yes, Mr. President. I'm looking at the route as we speak. Yes, I've been over it a thousand times, maybe more. No one knows this route better than I do. I know every crevice, every nook. No, no, no, no, Mr. President. You can't say nook and cranny. No, no, not in this case. Cause you would be thinking conventional and Arthur Gwenlyn is counting on that. Yes, he plans to pull this off right under our noses. And he knows that we think in a certain way. So it's very important that we know every crevice and every nook. Are you following me now, sir? Yes. Never get the impression that you're not secure. The last thing I would do is put you in a vulnerable position. Well, thank you, sir. (device beeping) (tense music continues) Yes, goodnight, Mr. President. Is someone there? (gun clicks) I said is somebody there? How'd you get in here? - Did I catch you at a bad time? Have you ever really fired that at anyone or do you just like to wave it around? - Where did you get these? - You think you're the only one who can record someone's life? I mean, you're in Hollywood. We do it all the time here. - [Mistress] I'm tired of being your goddamn mistress. Either you tell your wife about us or I will. (couple moaning) - Who do you have with you? All right, bring in that tape or I'll- - You'll what? Get up and chase him? How does it feel to be vulnerable? - Get outta here while I get dressed. - [Elizabeth] I didn't put you in this position. You did it to yourself. - Well, it's ridiculous. - Is it? You could have ended this whole thing. It was your decision to keep it going. - I wanted the conviction. - [Elizabeth] You wanted the excitement. - Bullshit. - How many threatening letters from harmless malcontents would you have to track down before you were able to command another case like this one? - We keep the President alive. - You're bored to death. At least Duggo keeps you shitting a little. - You're really a disgusting woman. - [Elizabeth] He slipped you before. He can do it again. - No, no, impossible. - Stop it. Arrest them now. - No. - You can come in now, Duggo. (footsteps approaching) (tense music continues) I think you should tell Duggo why you sent a helicopter in after him in the mountains. - No, no, no. I didn't do it. - Didn't you? He didn't do it. You sent a helicopter in because you wanted him to shoot at it so you could then send men in to kill him. And when that didn't work, you decided to use me. You see, you're not Arthur's creation after all, Duggo. You're his. (Granger moaning on tape) - No! (gun bangs) - Honey, are you all right? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Go back to sleep. - Like anybody, I would like to live a long life. Longevity has its place. - This was the night before he was shot. He knew what was gonna happen, but he couldn't change destiny. - And he's allowed me to go up to the mountain and I've looked over and I've seen the Promise Land. (audience cheering) I may not get there with you, but I want you to know tonight that we as a people will get to the Promise Land. (audience applauding) So I'm happy tonight. I'm not worried about anything. I'm not fearing any man. My eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord. - [Duggo] My dearest Lorina, your father promised me that this letter will get to you and I hope by the time it does, you'll know that I'm a true American patriot. I never wanted to be called hero. And that's not how I think of myself now. But tomorrow I must do something very difficult. And that may mean giving my own life. I know this is something you've been used to over the years, but this time is a little different. I can't tell you more, but let's just say that fate has me cast in a role I never thought I would play. Arthur Gwenlyn happens to be right about one thing. There are a lot of angry people out there. If something happens to me, please tell my daughter the good things you remember. As ever, your loving husband. (soft music) (helicopter whirring) (dramatic music) (soft tense music) (soft tense music continues) (bell ringing) - Rancher three. Rancher three on camera one and two. (Lahoud and Haddad speaking foreign language) (Eric whistling) - Well, I guess this is it, huh? - [Elizabeth] I guess so. - You know, this is gonna be one really exciting day. I can just feel it. And I promise you guys are really gonna be impressed by what I do. - I'm sure we will, Eric. - Elizabeth, are you ready? - I'm ready, Arthur. (tense music) - Rancher One. This is Rancher Four, over. - Go ahead, Rancher Four. - [Rancher Four] Redneck is leaving now. Be advised we're rolling out. - Copy Rancher Four. (tires squeal) (soft tense music) - I have a room reserved. Richard Wells. - Oh, Mr. Wells, we've been expecting you. You need help with that? - No, thanks. I'll manage. (soft tense music continues) (soft tense music continues) (dramatic music) (helicopter whirring) - Did you check the exposure? - Yes. - Both cameras? - Yes. Now shut up. You're making me forget things. - Shit. Look, I gotta run to the car. I forgot something for the video. - You better hurry back. (soft tense music) - Sorry, fellas. No parking up here. - How about those guys over there? - They work here. - You know we're shooting a movie. - A movie? - Yeah. Here's the permit. (soft tense music continues) - Oh, no. Shit. - Rancher Four. Pick up the Leatherneck right now. Arrest him. - [Rancher Four] Confirm, sir. You did say arrest now? - Affirmative. Nail him. - [Rancher Four] Yes, sir. Rancher Four out. - He's got to have the rifle with him. All we need is one live round and we can make it stick. - What the fuck made you change your mind? - It's just something in the pit of my stomach. - By the way, you can check the cameras in the back. (tense music) - Well, you can't do it up there. Down two levels is okay. - Please only will take us a few minutes. - You just can't do it, buddy. You have to go. - [Haddad] How about if you go away for a little while? I'll give you $50 for lunch. Nobody will know. Please. You can eat nice. Please. - I said let's go. Move it. - I don't think so. (gun bangs) (dramatic music) (Lahoud speaking foreign language) (sirens wailing) - Secret Service! Turn your engine off and put your hands where I can see them! - Stop, partner. Where the fuck's the owner of this vehicle? - I'm the owner. I won it at a poker game last night. And this hat too! What kind of shit is this? (tense music) (tense music continues) (tense music continues) - What do you mean you lost him? Damn it! - He's not coming here. Let's abort the visit. - We can't. I woke up at three o'clock this morning and I called the President. He refused. All right, we got one chance. Move out. (tense music) (sirens wailing) (tense music continues) (tense music continues) (Arthur sighs) - Elizabeth, no! Elizabeth! (tense music continues) (film reel whirring) (horns honking) (gun clicks) (scope whirring) - Come on, the top of you. Just stick your head out. - Forgot the damn lens. (sirens wailing) - All units move in and apprehend. Repeat all units, let's move in now. Let's get 'em now. - Secret Service. You're under arrest. - What are you doing? What the fuck are you... Get your fucking hands off me! - Oh shit. (tense music continues) - I'll go high. You go low. You ready? Secret Service. Don't move. - Don't shoot, man. Don't shoot! I'm unarmed! I'm unarmed! It's only a movie. It's only a movie, I swear! It's only a movie. - You're not supposed to be there. You're supposed to be over there. And this isn't in the show anymore. (Lahoud speaking foreign language) - Oh my God. (tense music continues) (sirens wailing) - This is the only one tall enough to see over the safety perimeter. (tense music continues) Secret Service. Off the elevator. Come on! (dramatic music) - Haddad. She's not your enemy. Let her go. - Haddad, there are Secret Service. (Lahoud speaking foreign language) (gun banging rapidly) (Arthur screams) (gun banging rapidly) (tense music) (film reel whirring) (helicopter whirring) - Bring them out, Arthur. Come on. (scope beeping) (dramatic music continues) (helicopters whirring) (scope beeping) (tense music) (tense music continues) (scope beeping) (car alarm blaring) - Haddad! (gun bangs) (gun bangs) (guns banging rapidly) (tense music) (helicopter whirring) (gentle music) (helicopters whirring) - I didn't let anybody else in. There's something I think you should see first. This is a torpedo spool. It unravels at a high rate of speed. It would've made that model helicopter wire guided, which means that Black Hawk flying up there couldn't have jammed it signal. Now Duggo saw this spool somewhere and he knew. He planned to save the President and Gwenlyn was going to film it. We got the wrong man. (soft music) - Special Agent Lang. Get me a full profile on Duggo. Psychiatric, full medical. - Full with pictures for the press? - Yeah, and in uniform. We never saw this. - Yes, sir, Chief Granger. (dramatic music) - And cut. That's a wrap. (all cheering) (jaunty music) - Hey, Lucas. You know, it was really great playing you, man. I mean, you know, you're really gave me a lot of good technical advice. I really appreciate it. - Yeah, but it was only a movie. (gentle music) - [Mary] "Crossfire" was a real departure for you. - Well, it's actually "Cross Point" Mary, but yes, it was a frightening departure. Actually, my wife came up to me and she said, "Do you know that the children are calling you a real killer?" Well, I said, "But it's only a movie." (all chattering) - [Actor] Took my blade and just stabbed him. - Excuse me? You're the director, aren't you? - Yes, I am. You're an actress, aren't you? - Yes. Well, I wanna be, and I'm taking classes right now, but haven't really done anything yet except some plays in high school. - Hey, don't put yourself down. That's acting. You're an actress. Come on, say it. I'm an actress. - Morton Lewis? - Yeah. - United States Treasury Secret Service. - Oh my God, I don't believe this. Hey, look, come on guys. I mean, this is just a movie, you know- - We're not here for this piece of crap. Did you hire a Brad Lucas under this film? - Yeah, yeah, I did. He was my technical advisor. I mean, the real one, you know. - [Agent] Have you seen him lately? - [Morton] No, no I haven't. It's funny, I gave him a part as a cop in the film and I thought maybe he'd show up to see it, but he hasn't. I don't know why. It was really his life story. But he was a little too scary. He kept wanting to make it more real. I had to tell him, "Look, it's just a movie." - [Announcer] Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States of America. ("Hail the Chief") (scope whirring) (scope beeping) (dramatic music) (jaunty music) (jaunty music continues) (dramatic music) (soft music)
