I'm missing you so much MEERA! Meera, don't worry I'll talk to him I got this Uncle, this is what I wanted to talk to you- Appa! Rascal! I knew you would barge in here when I saw you Let's discuss this Please don't get mad Shut up! Uncle, listen to me just once If you step in here again you'll be minus your legs - Uncle, please - Don't, pa Appa Useless fellow! Would you do this if I was your son-in-law? I will never choose a groom like you for my daughter You want to talk to me or you want me to leave? Meera, go inside Meera, your dad is looking with a totally wrong perspective Sit him down and explain to him We are not teenagers Talk to him like a woman 'Meera, go inside' GO! Stop! What work do you have on Meera's terrace? Why are you looking back? Look at me, da Hey! My bro-in-law! I love your sister to kingdom come Understand? We are like family now, bro Go put some sense into your father's head, man You look so much like your sister, da! Yuck! - Which grade are you in? - 12th Wrap up all these foolish antics Focus on your studies Okay? Understood? What did you promise this set up? I'll throw a party - Party, huh? - 'He screwed up' Party Here Hey! Tell your father I kissed you too What happened, Aditya? Appa, I haven't told you as yet But there's this girl- - I haven't- - No, just tell me what happened That's what I'm trying to tell you I know a girl called Meera I really love her I hadn't met her for 6 months So I had gone to her house On her terrace- We were in our private space Suddenly her dad came from this side and he got it all wrong in his mind What are you talking about? I just can't understand Tell me what happened, da That's what, appa, we are meeting after SIX months! Meeting for what? I'm telling you, pa we were in our private space We were in a corner on her terrace and suddenly her dad came from the other side He misunderstood it and it just took- I can't understand What is private space? - You explain to him - What is all this, Adi? Tell me, da - How old were you when you got married? - My age?! What was your age? How does that matter now? Hey Sid Keep quiet How old were you when you got married, dad? Okay, now what's my age? How are the two connected? Dad, what's my age? What is he trying to say? Sid, ask him to reply How old am I, dad? What's my age, dad? 25...you're 25 now - That's it! - That's what? Now I think you understand what private space means? - Sorry, I don't understand - Hey! Adithya Ask him to explain He's talking in riddles - What's he talking about? - Dad I'll talk to him, you go You go inside I'll talk to him Please go in, pa Adithya, get up and sit, dear It's all fine, if you are in a hurry to get married... ...you should ask 'Appa, get me married' Instead, if you ask him 'How old were you when you got married?' Isn't it wrong, da? If I say 'Meera and I were in our private space' 'You have done something wrong' he blames me' Badgers me to tell him what I have done What do I say, grandma? He just doesn't understand What do you expect him to understand? Love is the space both of you share exclusively in college Marriage is a different space altogether There will be minimum 10 people on the side of the bride and groom There will be many nosey parkers in between They will be judgmental They will debate all the do's and don'ts to see you are happy together Don't get flustered by the number of advisers Both of you should be steady as a rock! Not move an inch That's a great relationship It worked out easy for you and grandpa because of the same caste factor That's what you think! Did it happen that easily? My mother and her sister spoke their mind I must say rather insensitively 'It was wrong to have sent her to Delhi to study' they said' 'She has torn our dignity to shreds' They were both rude and crude All this is common Happens everywhere all the time When a woman falls in love ...her priorities are different Okay, what if they had said they will never accept whatever you do? I would have convinced them If they said, 'we just won't accept There's no room for that topic' I would have still convinced them Meera's dad has a foul temper You look at him as a short tempered man To Meera he is her father 1st you reduce your anger Grandma, Meera Come in, dear No formalities Sit down You look made for each other You will both be fine Don't worry You'll lead a happy and long life together Do you believe me? Thief! Cat got your tongue? See you Adi, is this your house? Did you talk to your dad? - Not yet - Very good - Don't talk - Why? No, it's okay, don't Don't tell him Did you kiss my brother? Yes, I did I'll kiss your parents too I don't know why you are so amused? Baby Our wedding night will be on this bed? 1st night? 549th night! You keep count? No Just like that TLC! Then how were you bang on? 549 times How do you know 549 is correct? You keep count? Baby Let's make it 550 Now? - Right here? - Yeah What's wrong? Appa He is really in love with that girl Let's go and talk to her parents before things get too complicated What do you want me to do? In another 2 days you're getting married You want me to meet them now? Whatever he rushes into foolishly ...he's stubborn enough not to take us into confidence That girl shares his clarity too No need, let them come and talk to us - Your dad at home? - Stay right there Don't come in I apologize for what happened yesterday But based on that please don't judge us both I love Meera very much I'll take care of her very well I've completed my Masters in medicine Wherever I practice I'll get a minimum of 200000, uncle I'll take care of her better than you I think once our families meet up ...you'll get some confidence in the matter I know you come from a very respectable family No, uncle That's not what I was trying to say You're misunderstanding this, uncle I know very well You'll show off your affluent temerity Uncle, I know you think all this is juvenile But please think of this just once...with an open mind If you do that you'll understand the depth we share Depth?! I am impressed by your usage of such 'deep' words Please let him finish, appa Shut up, you shameless girl Before inviting him over '...did you think of our feelings?' Listen to me clearly The caste and family background I choose my son-in-law from ...is a matter of prestige to me But to think I'll get my daughter married to you is simply out of the question - Get lost, man - Please don't interfere, Kishan Have you lost your mind? I love Meera Meera loves me And this is how you treat me? I am a surgeon! I'm an educated professional Not some riff-raff from the street And who the hell is this guy, Meera? If this is how it is If this is how it will be I expected it, I'm leaving - Adi, please listen - Meera! - 'Adi...!' - MEERA Baby, listen to me You should have told your dad what's going on between us What's got into you? Why are you raising your hand? I can't recite magical poetry like you do, Meera And even if I do, it's waste Your parents have no idea of love If they did, they won't oppose our relation- Meera, this is too much Just come inside He's getting our parents involved Adi...please! - Baby please - 'Meera' What happened? Hey! Who the hell are you? Call the police Dial 100, da Hang up Let's go Do I deserve this? Adi Love deserves respect Why all this, baby? You quote cinematic dialogs I'll smash your face What's up with him? Can't he understand? Won't he open his mind? Adi, that's my father! How's that? Say it once more I'll use my choicest cuss words at them, Meera Meera, imagine this is NOT 2019 Imagine the time kings ruled us I've waged a war against your dad for coming in between us I would've chained him and locked him in a metal cage And I would have married you in front of him, Meera In traditional Tulu style Have you gone mad? Have you completely lost it? Yes, I've completely lost it Look at me Baby, please Don't people in love say this? I was born for you You were born for me Do you know what I thought? Not only you, Meera Your father and mother Their respective parents Their grandfathers and forefathers were all born for me To make love To make babies So they can make babies So they can make you for me To make us meet And what happened here, huh? Listen to me I'll give you 6 hours time Decide what you intend doing in those 6 hours and call me I'm ready to do anything to live with you, Meera If you feel the same way, call me If you don't call you know me Please, Adi Don't complicat- What complicate, man? What is complicated now? What got complicated, tell me? Maximum what can they do? They will get you married to some chap Go...go...go, I curse that you get married to a Tulu guy Adi...Adi, please Meera, let me go free My bones Swear to God - My bones will get dislocated, Meera - Don't do this, Adi Your dad is looking disapprovingly at us, Meera I don't care - Your dad is looking - Baby - Oh my God! - Why are you doing this, baby? What about your family pride? What about your Shetty pride? - What about your Tulu pride, huh? - Baby, look at me Adi, look at me Baby I won't leave you and go anywhere Do you even think I can survive without you? 6 hours, Meera Adithya, what happened to you? Why shouldn't I drink in your bachelors' party? - Please do - Then why ask what happened to me? Enjoy yourself Have fun, okay? What the hell is this, Meera? Amma, there are 100s and 100s of mails Why don't you open and read it? It's even more fun 'Shameless girl Shut up!' What rubbish is this, Meera? Yeah, we were beneath the sheets Clothes off Naked Having sex 100s and 100s of times Shut up! How dare you talk so dirty in front of your parents! Meena, take her mobile away Groom is ready, right?

"You froze in my teardrops, my dream-wife" Parthi Is marriage ...that powerful, da? Does it mean ...nothing can be done? We can't do anything? Do I have to accept she's gone? If I'm unconscious for 2 days can she be someone else's wife? Without her consent, how do they force her to get married? I don't understand this Tell me what I should do You created such a ruckus but she didn't turn back even once No, da, I won't blam- Girls easily give up I am sure she wouldn't have heard anything in all that noise Okay, da, what's your plan now? She is my Meera, da Okay come, take me to her house - Hey Adi, don't da - Start the bike "My night and day blossom duly with the dawn of your eyes daily" MEERA! "My stifled breath wanders listlessly" MEERA, PLEASE JUST GET OUT OF THAT HOUSE "What has happened to my love sincere?" Don't spare him this time Take him to a police station or admit him in a mental hospital "I am like the parched land here waiting for the rains, my dear" Got a cigarette on you? - Beedi, bro? - 'What about that tea, da?' 'Coming, sir' 'I told you to meet the dean of the hospital, did you?' 'Sir, we intended to-' 'Get lost, lazy idiots!' Hey bro, no smoking in the station 'Yov, go and meet the dean in the hospital' Won't you advise him? Parthi, bring him inside through the rear entrance Come How many times will you go there and disgrace us? - Aren't you ashamed? - Ma, why discuss that now? You keep quiet All the wedding guests were asking your father about you At least we could have taken a group photo Don't be silly, ma Group photo is the last thing in my mind Photoshop a group photo if that's priority Siddharth, what happened because I didn't attend your wedding? - No issues - I want you to leave the house - I'll go after this evening get-together - Leave now - Please, pa - Get out Get out!

Chennai- When you come to Chennai, come home - Yes, da - 'I got a job, da' Congrats, da Start a new life from today Did you see Meera anywhere? How will she show herself to me? I meant- You went to pick your bike No, I sent my father to bring my bike back Okay, ask your father, if he saw Meera by any chance? I'm in the clinic I'll call you later, bye "Why did you give me this pain, my dear?" "Strife in my life severe" "In this wide universe can't find anything worse" Have you noticed this, Parthi? Meera never made eye contact with even a single chap in college She is a beautiful girl, da But she looked at me And it started from then Just some ...magic, man What did he say the other day? Our caste and our clan? Who taught all this? Where did it come from? It's cruel, man It's unfair, that's what it is! If Meera and I were together ...we would have brought a by product into this world A beautiful baby And now because of some external factor ...we both got divided and that baby will never see the face of this earth How can there be love in an arranged alliance? I don't buy that one bit Maybe they become hysterical after their wedding night together Brainless idiots! Hey, it depends upon the individual, da "Fulcrum of my life; silver lining" "Food for the water in my eyes brimming" "You kill me with your love overwhelming" "Come and peep in for awhile, dear" "I need you beside me here" "My life's breath is you" "Meaning of my life anew" "You're my pleasurable pain" "Fiery thoughts in my mind's domain" MEERA! "You closed my eyes for a second only" "I walk assuming you're teasing me" "When I open my eyes the next second I'm left all alone in solitude abandoned" "I don't want anyone but you, dearie" "Left behind pangs of misery" "Strangling my breath encircled in love's scorching flames tentacled" "I searched for your eyes; in vain" "I wish to see you once again" "My life's breath is you" "Meaning of my world anew" "You're my memorable pain" "Fiery thoughts as fountain" '4 months have sped past Meera has moved on' Look at you! Stuck like a rock stagnating in your life You've told me 500 times 'Meera is married' I'll repeat it 5000 times So what now? - Parthi, come here - 'No, I won't, you'll hit me' I won't hit you, promise Come Imagine your girlfriend is PMSing I don't even have a girlfriend That's why I said 'imagine'! During that time 'Baby, I know you'll hurt with this pain every month' 'Bear it for 4 days, it will vanish' Will you console her like this? Or call her close to you Make her lie on your thighs Not what you think, country bumpkin! 'Thighs' is lap Your lap Rest her head on your lap Understand what she's going through Be attentive and supportive Aren't we medical students? Will you ask her to flex her hips and lie on one side? Or will you say it is your fate as a woman and you have to go through it? Now All that is okay Why bring up my village? Junk of a jerk! - You got only that? - Hey, I understand I get it totally When women have PMS during their periods ...you need to be treated the same way they should be pampered, right? They have painful cramps for 4 days You are a pain for 31 days, correct? My dear man, I can't handle your mood swings for heaven's sake! I have work in the clinic, bye "You're my pleasurable pain" "Fiery thoughts as my friendship vein" "My life's breath is you" "Meaning of my world anew" "You're my pleasurable pain" "Fiery thoughts in my mind's domain" "Did distance make us distant 'cos existence got me thinking" "Now for instance, if I insisted" "An answer for these questions" "What were you on a leash? Which made me a stray from the street?" "Is this what they call defeat cos, baby then this time I'll bring a...fleet!" "Why did you give me this pain, my dear?" "Strife in my life severe" "In this wide universe can't find anything worse" - Hurry up - Can't you see I'm coming? 'Sir...?' Come in, dove who spreads peace! She'll work properly from now on, sir - Take her back, sir - Did you see his feet? So far this aunty has broken 10 glasses I'll pay for all the glasses, sir Who wants your cash? What did sir say? Call Meera by her name? But this aunty refers to her in 3rd person just to bug him If he loses his cool, either she should apologize or go about her work quietly Instead she keeps laughing to annoy him further You dumbo woman! How can you call sir's wife in 3rd person disrespectfully? This, huh? Yov! Who will pay Rs 2000 for the shabby work this lady does? No one, sir 'And she's the leader of a gang' Whether her work is done or not ...she'll call for a meeting and tear everyone's lives threadbare Gossip with a capital G about all the residents Pass unwanted comments about who is coming and going in every house That management chap pours vitriol into my ears! Protesting about sir bringing in someone at night Why do you poke your nose in sir's affairs, di? Even that's okay How do you look at a girl and decide...what did you say- And call her a 'TwayOn'? You're a woman too Don't you know? Is that how you speak or is this what you call decorum? I'm really clueless Kindly explain! Sir is a doctor, you moron! Will they stoop to such levels? - Moron- - If anything happens tomorrow Who is responsible? Who is in charge? Here afterwards I won't deride sir at all Not a word about Meera 'madam' too I won't gossip or add eyes and ears to a single soul downstairs I'll come work, finish and go home diligently Come tomorrow 'Thanks, sir' Hey Stinking of whiskey Pop a mouth-freshener Why? As if I'll kiss some girl? King of comebacks! Adi, if I hadn't knocked on the door with my 'darling, open the door' dialog ...you think you would have got your job done? - Yes - No chance, casanova I know you since you were a toddler! Don't think you can fool- How do you know that 'darling, open the door' story? Did I blabber when tanked? Even if you blabbered it will only be about 'Meera' I was the one who referred that patient to you, that baldie photographer Okay, tell me this How did it begin? That chap had a fracture in his radius, right? That girl would call the hospital daily And ask 'Can I give my fiancé chicken or veggie diet only?' 24x7 nuisance Is it jaundice or what to specify a bland diet? I gave her my phone # - Straight? - Direct connection Who are you, man? How did you learn all this? You went to check that girl and got your job done! Ice into your pants? Sir...shave Why is she bugging me daily saying 'shave' when she passes by? Don't take all that seriously 1st come out of the mind-set you can forget Meera with all these flings Understood?

"Why does my heart beat helplessly when you move away from me?" "O' dream, in my sleep duly why did you haunt me daily?" "Till the moon goes to bed at wee hours why did you shower me with honey, I ask?" "You...like rain above" "Me...as land below" "As a garland of dewdrops fall this flower blooms overall" "Like the waxing moon aglow with bliss in the days that follow" "O' dream, in my sleep loyally why did you haunt me totally?" "Till the moon sleeps in the sky's altar why did you shower me with nectar?" "Why this flustered feeling? My breath goes a-reeling?" "Why does my heart beat helplessly when you move away from me?" "O' dream, in my sleep duly why did you haunt me daily?" "Till the moon goes to bed at wee hours why did you shower me with honey, I ask?" Hey, Parthi - Why is this girl ironing my shirt, da? - 'Which girl?' - Priya, da - Hey! Where are you now? My flat of course 'She just woke me up with coffee' Oh! You drank, huh? Job over? Don't think too much Your brain may pop out 'It will happen now, right? Happy journey!' Hey! Listen to me seriously I read her Wikipedia page She passed out of IIT, Ahmedabad Her father is retired chief justice of Delhi High Court it seems Got what I said? Buddy You can't get a better chance than this Settle down with her 'Dai! Shouldn't you know when that girl irons your shirt?' I don't like someone doing all this for me I should feel like doing this of my own accord I felt that way only with Meera Hey! Back to square 1, huh? Meera is married to someone else 'That chapter is over, da' 'Why are you still reading that same book called 'Meera'? I don't get it' 'If you drink 24x7, you'll die-' What, heroine? You've lured an innocent chap into your web, huh? If someone sees us what will they think? Lakshman will deal with it - Ooops! - Oh yeah! Adi Adi, I love you Adi...Adi - Adi, what happened? - Madam - Adi, wait - Sit inside, madam Lakshman, get out of the way - Madam - Adi, wait - What happened? - What 'what happened?' I've told you twice already Then what do you mean by 'love' or dove? Adi, let us discuss this inside the car please Hey! All this won't work out for you, understand? Why do you drag love into this? Aren't you intelligent? Why you being so emotional? - Adi - Look here I won't come and meet you You don't come looking for me I'm done with your- Really? Get this, Adithya Your life with Meera ended right then Why can't you accept that? Lakshman, get lost! 'Get this, Adithya' 'Your life with Meera ended right then' 'Why can't you accept that?' 'Hello, sir, I'm Tulsi calling from the hospital' Tell me, Tulsi Prabhu sir case is an emergency, sir Tulsi, it's my day off 'I know, sir Sir...hello?' 'Sir, no one else is on call here' Tulsi! 'Sir, emergency case' TULSI! I'm not in a condition to operate on any patient, Tulsi We'll do it tomorrow Sir, please, if you want I can give you Alpax 'Really critical, sir He has lost a lot of blood' 'We will lose the patient' Follow the basics, hook the patient on the ventilator, I'll be there now 'Okay, sir' Sir, all preparations done - Deepa - Yes, sister Sir, are you okay? Tulsi, what happened here? What happened? This is regarding the reputation of Orbit Hospital Whatever happens, I'll make sure that man's licence is cancelled I'll go to any lengths necessary Tell your favorite doctor I'll see him in court Ma'am, if you go straight Room # 1729 - First room - Okay, thanks - I'll get some food, eat something - Got a cigarette? Adithya Hello, aunty How are you, dear? Hey Parthi The body rings an alarm bell once in our life To announce the end of its capacity We should pay heed and stop everything then Right away Period, full stop He doesn't listen to anyone, sir He has to listen, da Or he'll see Heaven! Are you still drinking? - Why? - Yes, ma I drink daily How does that matter to you? I feel like living this way Just let me be Bugging me with questions and torturing me 'What kind of a question is this?' 'Is this how you handle a sensitive issue?' 'Let's face facts' 'Dr Adithya Varma is our college topper' 'He's one of the best doctors St Patrick's has produced' 'He had some anger issues' 'I accept that' 'But alcoholism, drug addiction? Who said so?' 'Is it easy to become a good qualified surgeon?' 'What 'Indian medical Council?' 'Indian medical council is to do with doctors like us' 'Why should media and politics poke their-' Grandma, you used to keep asking about his whereabouts Now even after you know you don't want to visit him I don't understand why I can't see him in his present condition You don't have to see him At least you can talk over the phone? If you call him, he will definitely come home, grandma Siddharth, if the person we love dies that's a different feeling altogether It is different leaving us and drifting away from us In the 1st case scenario Our heart and mind will get adjusted to the fact he won't come back to life Like me In the 2nd case it won't fade out that easily It's very painful Like Adithya I can extend any help he wants but- Can I share his suffering with him? So are you saying we just abandon him? Suffering is verrry personal, Siddharth Let him suffer Adi, Mr Anantanarayanan Very successful lawyer He will be handling your case 1st of all don't keep saying 'case' as if I committed some crime As far as I'm concerned this isn't even my case I was called because there wasn't any doctor on emergency call Isn't the patient alive? In cases like this patient being dead or alive is secondary Primary case is a surgeon That is you If he has consumed alcohol during surgery time Depending on whether it is within permissible limit or not This can change into criminal and medical negligence So, Adithya, tell me - What was your alcohol intake that day? - Criminal negligence? Do you know under what circumstances I went to the hospital on that day? Without motor control I could barely talk, that's all I sat in the chair, guided the head nurse and performed the surgery If I hadn't done that the patient would have died you know Medical negligence! We also heard about this We understand too Are you a surgeon? Sid, is this man on our side? - Of course - Then why is he talking like this? I don't like this interrogation tone Adithya, the case has gone out of our hands Indian medical council is also involved Sid, I need a better lawyer Hospital management is trying to prove you're guilty As a womanizer, as a drug addict, as- As an alcoholic womanizer for God's sake Already this news has been splashed in all newspapers and all TV channels I want your complete support to get you out of this Adithya, can you hear me? Please, da I'll go to any extent to help you out Please, da Show some presence of mind This is eye witness material All your patients have endorsed Saying that you're a wonderful surgeon There are totally 484 radiographs Your total number of working days is 214 Your total count of surgery is 486 2 are unavailable Out of station But in your hospital log book ...number of surgeries entered is only 300 on the whole Even if log books can be manipulated radiographs won't lie Because in every single radiograph 'Referred by Dr Adithya Varma' Your name has been embossed I can give the back-up also Plus in your favor is ...the patient is still alive If we grease some palms we can manage to cover up, it's easy Want to know the minus? Hospital management has collected your blood sample Alcohol level shows 140+ in that test And you are high on cocaine - What shall we do now? - Good question A preservative is added in that blood test Only due to variation in the fermentation level ...we can make the blood test invalid claiming the results were wrong But most importantly, 184 surgeries haven't been entered in the log book if I mention this in court that's enough Hospital management will plead guilty Adithya, very simple Go in for a neat shave Wear crisply ironed pant and shirt Come with a calm demeanor Whatever you say that day repeat that verbatim Constantly That's all Okay, Siddharth I'll leave Okay? Bye I'm coming, sir This case is as good as won But my only worry Your brother's unconventional mind-set Siddarth, this kind of free spiritedness won't work in our democracy You have to deal with it Irrespective of how much you pay to manage this ...don't let it show on your face - Okay? Right - Thank you No time, da Adi Adi...? Adi? Where is he? - Hey Parthi - Hey! - Hey Adi - Lift him up Be careful, da Go this side Watch your step Careful! Make him sit in the chair Gently Look here - Adi - Wait How could he? Dai! Adi Hey...hey Adi! Why, da? I'll be back Wait 'Parthi!' Everything is over, Tarun What are you doing, da? - Wait, da? - Why do you need this now? Shut up, da I don't know how Hey! Adi...Adi Get up Adi...dai! Look at me Come, sit up Go on...do it Snort, da Careful Hey...hold him 'How is he now?' Crystal clear! Your brother has arranged an in-house court hearing with great difficulty Please try to be normal Are you teaching me how to be normal after intake of alcohol, da? Hey...dai! 1st wear your pants, da Madam, he has a drinking problem The nurses in the hospital have served him liquor out of sheer fear In fact we found drugs in the surgeons' dressing room He behaves rudely with everyone I got to know all this rather late But the toxicology report gives him a clean chit Present your proof Court won't accept this kind of emotional statement We have got 300 recorded videos as testimonials from patients And a written document from the dean of St Patrick's Medical College, Mangalore 'Explaining his sincerity and efficiency' Parthi Convocation was held, right? Do you remember the oath? Hey! Case is going in your favor Don't mess it up Wrong, da Give me the proof and statement of the accused Ma'am Hey Sid...Siddharth What is happening? How much did you pay? Dai...dai...dai! Look at appa Dad doesn't like all this What are you doing now? Will you shut up now? My profession is the only thing I like about myself, da Please, da Listen to me How can I function as a doctor if we win a case by greasing palms? Shut up, da I can't...I can't I can't do that I'll be living a lie Don't mess it up Please listen to me Pleeeease! If I go to jail now Will your dignity lessen somehow? - Tell me - Just keep quiet Isn't that how you feel? Please stay quiet Siddharth, please please - Try to underst- - Silence! Dr Adithya Varma If you say anything now, it will be admissible for criminal proceedings 'Do you understand that?' Nodding isn't good enough - You have to say it - Yes, I understand Tell me the time you attended surgery I don't remember What is the case you were treating that day? Can you explain in detail? Road traffic accident case Multiple fractures Patient was diabetic Long history of asthma Patient's name Shankar Age 58 Good The opposition claims you weren't even conscious And in a state of half consciousness you instructed the head nurse Stabilized the patient and conducted the surgery Is that correct? Yes Now tell me, Dr Adithya Were you intoxicated on that day before the surgery? Had you consumed alcohol? Or any other form of substance abuse? Just say no I'll repeat the question 'Were you in any way intoxicated...' '...or on drugs' '1 day before the surgery?' Deny it, Adi Please, da YES! Were you drunk on the day of the surgery? Yes, I was drunk And the day before too I have always been drunk for all the operations I've performed Even now I've come here drunk Yes, I'm an alcoholic I have a drinking problem Adi But no patient of mine has been harmed before this because of my inebriated state And I am proud to say it And I am good at what I do Goddamn it! I have ruined the trust patients place on doctors I...I do not deserve to be a doctor It is in no way connected with my hospital Please make that clear I think there is nothing more to say Your license will be seized for minimum 5 years If you try to practice during this time frame 'You will be put behind bars' 'For 3 years' Appa, I'm sorry Sid, I'm sorry, da Section 269 of the Indian Penal Code Causing hurt by act 'Endangering lives' 'Or personal safety of others' 'Whoever causes hurt to any person by doing act so rashly or negligently' After all this, you didn't want to listen to us? 'Has to endanger human life for the personal safety of others' 'Shall be punished with imprisonment of either description' '...for a term which may extend to 3 years' 'Or with fine which may extend to 500 rupees or with both' Come, Meera Why have you started smoking 'beedi' now? It gives me a kick What happened to all the stuff at home? You sold them and drank with that money? I sold all that so you can have money for your grandpa's funeral rites Hey! It hurts Why don't you ask me if you need money? Parthi, put that cash back How often I've borrowed from you? Adjust this for the lunch I ate at your place Chee! Don't act too smart Here, take it What the eff...get out! 'Hello? Mister! He seems to be missing?' Where's my air conditioner? 'Fridge is missing The furniture here-' Where is all my stuff? Hello! What is happening here? 1st vacate this place I'll call the police Get out! I'll show you a place, bro Stay here just for the night Okay? Bro, lie down here This is my place No one will dare breathe a word 'I'll get you the perfect house in the morning' 'Okay?' - What, bro? - Your friend isn't here - He has vacated - Where did he go? I don't know, sir 'Free public Toilet' Bro, walking off without paying? Oldie! Whom are you asking for money? Write it down in my account Bad enough you are a freebie yourself '2 cups tea' 2 more days, bro You'll get a house Why do you worry, bro? I'm there for you We are a team, bro "I can see in my mind with delight a future so rosy and bright" 'Will we get our tea today?' Dai! What are you doing here?

Move - Move out - Okay, bro Dude, your grandma passed away Totally unexpected Adithya - Sit down - No, it's okay Where is appa, ma? He's over there Appa Why are you sitting here all by yourself? Appa Appa, I can understand how you must be feeling I know you will be the most affected by grandma's demise We led our lives without even thinking such a day will dawn, right?

Adi, don't get hyper "Take me in your arms, love of mine" "Who knows if this night sublime if we will ever share again this lifetime" "In this life again we may or may not meet someday" Give it to me Ages since I took a puff Last was when I was in college Here you go No need, pa Adithya This is a famous English proverb It's not the goodbyes that hurt But the flashbacks that follow It may seem very simple to you But there's a world of truth embedded in it I think the time has come for you to understand it Appa, I'm- Sorry From today I'll give up all my bad habits It's okay, Adithya I understand Why don't you take a break? I think you deserve it Come back We can start afresh What are you thinking? There's plenty more to see in life Don't waste time stagnating like this Bro, make an U turn "In a life without anyone" "I yearned for you alone" "In the shower of love till end of time" "I slept in the warmth of your lap divine" "You are drifting away from me my soul shatters to shards totally" "I try to string myself again with the remaining dust in vain" "Not carrying her glances in my mind’s eye as nuances" "Dawn of such a day is not too far away" "It seems ultimate in a few seconds" "Death as a boon that beckons" "In the depths you disappeared into" "I try to hide to find you" "I melt in the orphaned wind anew" "I save my tears for you exclusive" "My miracle pool elusive" "I understand now the anomaly of a fish not thirsty living in the sea" "To a no man's island I'm travelling" "As an insignificant dot I’m shrivelling" "How will I bear the burden burning of fire’s footprint on a beetle’s wing?" "Where can I buy an unscarred heart without you in my life, sweetheart?" "I save my tears for you special" "My magic pool essential" You're here in Europe Didn't think of even calling me? I stay just 2 hours from here You don't pick my calls either Fine, forget that What are you doing here? Hey Tarun When I was coming here I saw Meera, da 8 months pregnant So...? She isn't happy I can see that clearly Fine, she was forced into a marriage Okay This pregnancy? - So what? - Whaaat? Hey! She's my girl, man Same girl Same Meera She's married and pregnant As if anything will change? Adi, are you aware of what you're saying? I'm going back to Chennai tonight I wasn't in my senses that day I screwed it up Now with all my senses intact Let me tell you now She is my baby She should be only with me No one can prevent that 9 months since Meera got married She is someone else's wife Watch your tongue Speak decently Don't go back to your old style, okay?

Thanks a ton Your words came true You must be happy now? Leave now Go Baby, don't keep shooing me away Come, let us go home On that fateful day the time you gave me Was just 6 hours, right? You abandoned me and left, right? In that 6 hours my whole life collapsed There are restrictions for a girl in her house, Adi You don't have sisters, right? How will you understand? Crossing many hurdles I came home to you that night I couldn't meet you I bore all that Because I knew you would come But when did you come? After the ceremony 2 days later What were you doing till then? Just You forgot? I swear he didn't know you came over that night When you didn't call, like a psycho he started injecting morphine to himself Became an overdose It was a hopeless situation for him 'Just missed, otherwise he would have gone once for all' 'He regained consciousness after 48 hours' 'By then your wedding and his brother's wedding...over' 'When he got up, moment he knew you were getting married, he was at your doorstep' 'His father threw him out of the house' He attended hospital daily staying all by himself His grandma died some time back 'You wouldn't have known all this' I came all that way, Meera But you didn't even look at me How far? Was that the Himalayas? Boat club to Adyar, that's all? Why should I see you? Why did you come now? To get bashed up again? Please don't remind me of all that Baby, please Calm down Okay, I won't come again to meet you But just answer this 1 question of mine Go ahead What is stopping you from coming away with me? This, right? This? - Meera, this is just flesh and blood to me - Oh! Really? Meera, trust me I'll handle this I'll take care This society, our families, our friends Eff all of them Meera, don't think too much Come with me Okay I'll come with you When the baby is born? Whom do I show as the dad? Point at me Sounds good to hear But I don't intend falling for it You have your heroine You have booze to forget the people who love you Plus totally into drugs, right? - You can go - 'No, Meera, he has given up all that' Parthi No one is more important to me than you, Meera I'll talk to your husband if you want I can go right now and talk to him Just say 'yes', please Come here Sit down Come closer Baby, how did you survive without me all these days? Tell me I came away the 3rd day after I was married But to think I should go back to you It didn't occur to me at all I was so angry with you I didn't go back to my parents either I stayed in a hostel nearby I'm working in a clinic My anger dissipated after a while I thought I'll get back to you But only then my periods got delayed I found out I was pregnant After that I didn't want to reconcile with you After some time I thought I'll come back to you But at that time I saw your name in the paper ...linked with that heroine I read that news I was so terribly upset Some day Some day or the other you'll come in search of me This firm belief was implanted in a corner of my mind So I was waiting Adithya I didn't let my husband touch even my little finger! Not even my used clothes Adi, this is not just flesh and blood Listen carefully to what I'm about to tell you This is your baby Yes, Adi "O beloved!" Do you know how many times I thought? I should tell you this Till now I never felt like confiding in anyone about this I wanted to tell you first, Adi Tell me I'm pregnant You'll be a father soon We are pregnant We'll be parents soon Adi Do you know how furious I was with you? But my anger that brewed for 9 months Vanished into thin air in just 9 minutes! That's okay It's okay Marry me Today Right now At this very moment "You cascaded one day into my heart" Come "I knitted you in my atrium never to part" subtitled by rekhs assisted by seth and krish "You melted in my eyes ever so rapid" "I enclosed you, I did with love, with my eyelid" "Blessed by the arrow of Cupid" "Tell me now your reason, my love" "Why did you abandon me thus letting miles come between us?" "Wait, my dear fellow" "Let me bask in the warmth of your love" "You danced one day into my heart" "I knitted you in my atrium never to part" "A part of me, my sweetheart" "I searched for the life I lost; agitated Even when you were there; I vegetated" Mistake is all mine Only now I understood the love you both share is so pure "Let your nights and my dream unite in our life's love-stream" "Let the bliss of living with you" Forgive me, dear "Till the end of time continue" "Darkness has dissolved out of sight A new light has blossomed bright" "I find more meaning now for my heart to race faster, love" "Did I liquefy in your love's melody? Or breaking in our mutual rhapsody?" "Do I melt and dissolve in the embrace of your love?" "If I will merge into you once again" "I don't mind separation and the pain" "My only beloved always to be loved" "If I had to leave you once again" "I'll die this very second, I'm certain" "In front of you, my beau" "Enough, love so true This bond will do" "My soul will live for 100 births I'm sure" "Live life as a joyful adventure" "My sole soul mate forever"
