I'm Benny it's nice to meet you - Yeah, yeah - So, where're you from Benny? - Me? I'm from the south. How about yourself? - I'm from Yugoslavia - Yugoslavia? - Mmm... - Is that still a place? - Technically no - Your parents're still over there? - My parents? Why do you ask? I just wouldn't have guessed you're from that part of the world - Why? - No disrespect. I just don't detect much of an accent Maybe i don't know enough about it though. - People change as much as they want to just depends on how badly they want to get away from something. - What were you getting away from? - Your parents're okay with it? - What's that? - Having boys in your bedroom - I don't know if they'll ever really understand it, you know. But... yeah, they're okay with it. How about you? - Oh my god, I love this movie I can't believe you have this. But why is it in a plastic wrap? - Oh! It's because I actually haven't seen it. - That's all? Hold on. You own this but you haven't seen it? - Yeah. - What? Dude...get to the bank this is like you having an uncashed check. It's only the most unexpected love story of all time - Of all time? - Yeah It's a love that survives in spite of it all. He made it a few years before he died of a cocaine overdose. I... I can't believe you have this setting here. - You're talking about your parents, I think. - No. It's strange, isn't it? - What's up? - Do you ever think about what else is happening right now? - What do you mean? - Like what other things in the world are... are happening at the same time, same time as us in this room right now. - Why does it matter? - Oh, I don't know. I... I guess it's just something to think about. Like take for example our parents. How old is your dad? - Almost 60. - Almost 60? Same as mine. - They're so much alike - You see, your dad was planning his 401k and shopping for cruise lines with your mom. At the same time, my dad was planning his great escape. And see, that's where I come from. They were, they were managing their own unions along with other unhappy dads while the rest of the world was telling them no, no! You have to adapt, you have to adapt, you have to adapt You have to adapt, you have to adapt, you have to adapt So they had this this pent up rage and this... this this anger, this... this, this piercing voice in the back of their head telling them to to take it out the last shout so every night they'd beat their wives and beat out their neighbors and can even hit their gay sons. - Shh... -What? - My roommate's trying to sleep - Oh - That's fine. She might mind their own business - Excuse me - Shit!... Hmm... - Fuck - Hmm... are you okay. You need some... - I think I did too much blow - Can I get you a towel? - Uh yeah, just in that closet there - Okay, whatever's on the ground - Sure, uh... - What will this do? - Yeah, yeah. That's fine. - You're pretty lucky I'm here - It's okay - Relax, hey, okay, it's okay - All right. I think it's stopping - You need some help? - No. I'm fine, thanks. - You know, I used to get those all the time as a kid - What the fuck are you doing? - Having fun Yeah, hey! - No, no, I... I think we just need to brain check this. Let's call it. - Hey seriously, if it's the nose thing I'm totally fine - No... - If it's the glass... - It's not the nose thing, it' just... I'm tired and I... think we got it with the wrong foot, so let's just...let's just call the night. - Oh come on. Pick another dvd you haven't seen, I tell you about it. - Hey listen, listen... - This one's still in its... - Like I said, not tonight I'm so sorry. What are you doing? - I'm sorry, but I have to be honest with you. I really don't feel like leaving. I'm so sorry. It's one of those things. - What? Try again another time if you want All right man, come on! Come on! All right man, take it easy. - [Coughing] - I'm sorry captain - Please - Oh... oh... Stop - Relax, you can handle it, captain. - Okay, stop! Stop! Stop! All right man. This is getting fucking weird. Just... just go, all right? - I thought we were having fun - Paul, I know what's not getting through to you. Please get the fuck out of my house - Benny come on.
