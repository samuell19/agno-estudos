In loving memory of Late Haradhan Karati In our hearts we know you are there with us Whirr-whirr! Turns the wheel! Cling-clang! Glasses break! Whoosh-Whoosh! Blows the wind! Chug-chug! On the rail! Croak-croak! Froggies jump! Rat-a-tat-tat! Beat the drums! Maa... What? Why did you stop? Go on. Croak-croak! Froggies jump! Rat-a-tat-tat! Beat the drums! Swish-swash! Goes the whip! Clip-clop! Gallops the horse! Maa... India on that side and Bangladesh on this one. Who then does the river Ichhamati belong to? Stop jabbering and learn the rhyme quickly. Whirr-whirr! Turns the wheel! Cling-clang! Glasses break! Whoosh-Whoosh! Blows the wind! Chug-chug! On the rail! Maa... do they have a moon in their country? Why do you talk so much, son? Learn the rhyme! Baba says India too will have idol immersions today... Baba is right. The border is opened today. No restrictions. Maa, do people die in their land? Our Durga idols will also be immersed today. Won't you go? No. Everyone's going. Won't you come along? Why stay alone at home? Come along. Maa... do you hear me? Maa... please come along? You never go. Told you I won't go! Now go on, learn the rhyme! Go. Rivers Ganga, Yamuna, Saraswati, Brahma, Vishnu, Maheshwar (The Trinity) Allah, Rasool, monks, faqirs Deities, giants, demons, the fallen Your name And the name of the moon Streams, brooks, rivers, rivulets, lakes and seas, all of it Set afloat! Set afloat! Set afloat! Set afloat! In the name of Badar Peer! In the name of Goddess Durga! Move it, move it, move it, fast! Row it! Row it! Row it! Fast! The valour in the pace! Oh! What a view to see! Here goes our boat, the boat that we row! O come along, let's set Durga a-sail! Here goes our boat, the boat that we row! O come along, let set Durga a-sail! Brother, row it! Row it faster! Brother, row it! Row it faster! The Durga Puja of the Hindus! With huge offerings of quince leaves! I tasted their divine water! Made from river Ichhamati! Such beautiful idols, Grandma! Huge idols of Durga, Uncle! With Kartik, Ganesh, Lakshmi, Saraswati, Durga, Bhabani, the daughter of our earth... Sets sail for heaven! So keep rowing the boat! The woman, she rides a lion! She held the demon-Asura by his head! She wrapped a snake around his neck Shoved a trishul into his chest! Huge idols of Durga, Uncle! Such beautiful idols! Here goes our boat, the boat that we row! O come along, let's set Durga a-sail! So keep rowing the boat! Hurry! Come on, quick! Your dark skin scarred by the battle scars of love from her nails Seems like a black stone carved with gold, reflecting your victory in sex Beautiful! The tenth bite mark from her lies on your lips...- - That's enough for today! We'll start from here tomorrow. Bhabani-babu, the agony of unrequited love... Is it eternal? Is there no end to it? No. If life surprises you every moment, how will you find peace? There is no peace. Who knew such a catastrophic storm would hit us on the holy day of Mahalaya? Such is a fisherman's life. But our family priest, Bhabani-babu... Please step forward. - - Yes. He predicted that Goddess Durga would arrive riding on waves. Severe chance of thunderstorm. But she was to leave on the elephant. That is fortunate. Fertility will increase. The yield will be high. Joy and peace shall prevail. But only after the immersions. There's nothing to worry then. He asked everyone to stay alert about the destructive activities of the extremists. Among others, the Communication Minister of Takuteli and the Minister of Supplies, presented their views. According to them, the new flyover will make the international airport more accessible. The reason why I called everyone here... the annual distribution of sweets for Bijoya after Durga Puja... Cannot happen without your help. Right? Snacks and sweets like Naru, Nimki, Gaja... have to be prepared. But considering the losses due to the storm, I've decided on I've decided to pay you two hundred rupees each. Okay? Besides, the confectioners will fry Jalebis here. And Jalebis are difficult to make... And the pain in Radha's heart... Huh?- - Is impossible to fathom... Lau is back! Then Shri Krishna... - Shri Radha... - Ganesh babu? The Urban Development Authority estimated a budget of thirty-two crores. The Prime Minister said, the Bagmati River Bridge is her Eid gift to the citizens. She said, the bridge will help people in this area reach Dhaka in fifteen minutes. It takes them more than three hours now. As for the losses incurred by the public... The old man was listening to the radio. The oven hadn't been lit. She was nowhere... the pond, the bamboo forest. The bathroom?- - No. There was a small lock on the main door. Did you check the time?- - Yes. It was six-thirty. Where could she go so early?- - She was home last night. The bulb was still lit when I was coming home. So she must have left only this morning. Where could she go so early? 'Padma' what? Haldar. Husband's name? He is dead. Is his name dead as well? Say the name. Ramen Haldar. That's him, in that room. My father-in-law. His son's name is Ratan Haldar. And my maiden name? I know this one. Padma Das. Right. My father: Parimal Das. Mother: Kamala Das. Village: Ratuil. Police Station: Kashiani. District: Gopalganj, Faridpur. Madhumati, the only major river there, flows beside our house. My father owns a sari shop in the area. I will remember that. Otherwise you will die. The BDR will shoot you down. Not BDR. It's BGB now. 'Border Guard Bangladesh'. Only the name's changed. Like this, you must remember the other names as well. You are an Indian. Staying here illegally. If this goes out, it's all over. You'll end up dying. And take me down too. Imagine what would happen to me. No... with a little practice, I will manage. You have been so kind. You mustn't fall into trouble due to me. No way! Then please try and remember the names. So... what's your full name? Naser Ali. What! Where in India are you from? Taki, Basirhat? There. From now on... From now on your home's at Kashiani, Faridpur. What! Forget it. Let me make this easier. Gopalganj, in Faridpur. Yes. That's better. We have a Gopalganj too. I'll remember this. What will you say if someone asks the name? Why, 'Gopalganj'? No, your name! Naser Ali is fine, right? I'm Muslim. Won't be an issue here in Bangladesh. A young Muslim man is staying at a Hindu widow's house. What would they say in India? Is this very normal? Even in Basirhat they'd ask a thousand questions. Who, where from, why? Which is why from today you're my uncle's son. Your home is at Gopalganj. Faridpur? Hindu. Subhash Das. The Indian freedom fighter, Netaji Subhash Chandra? 'Subhash'. Will you remember now? Subhash Das... Of all the love stories in Bangladesh, yours is a gem. Her house is in ruins, so you won't take care of yours either. The roof's dripping. You don't mend it. Creepers all over. You don't cut them. Such empathy! But tell me. Everyday you coat yourself in makeup like a Jatra actor... how is this helping? Don't get on my nerves so early in the day! You're preparing the bait beside the pond. And dropping it into the water, expecting the fish will eat it happily and come up to thank you. You must have a fishing line, Ganesh-babu! Fishing line?- - Dada! Dada! Wear this perfume today! Maya Kakima (aunt) brought this from India. A sari and this perfume. I will wear the sari on Lakshmi Puja. Oh no, this is a lady's perfume. Do you want to kill me, silly girl!? Why, Dada! Just try it once! It smells of jasmine! I'm done for if she smells a lady's perfume on me! No fishing line will work. She'll get me completely wrong. Keep this. Lau, let's go! Dada... You've got so many printed shirts. Why wear white clothes like an old man? Change into one of them? Do you see the grey hair? Respect it. Can you speak our dialect? 'Bangal'? Not very well. But... (Speaks in Bangal) If you teach me, I could try. You're speaking it quite well. Speak to me in this dialect from now. Hear me? Yes. And listen. Don't respond with a 'Yes'. Instead, we say 'Jee'. Correct me if I go wrong. I have... some friends back home. From Bangladesh. I've heard them speak. (Tries to speak Bangal) This won't do. Your tone is different from ours. You think it's enough to include some Bangal words? You'll get caught. Yes. That's possible. Not 'Yes'. Say 'Jee'. Please try and remember! It beats me. What? One river. The dialects spoken on either side are so different. Right. Absolutely different. Even within Bangladesh, dialects and tones differ from one region to another. If you hear our Sylheti or Chittagonian dialects, you'll understand nothing. So... We could do something... Couldn't I pretend to be a mute if you had a visitor? What? Huh? It'll be easier. I won't need to speak at all. What happened? None of it is easier, Subhash da. When faced with danger one can even forget their father's name. No need to act. Just tell them, you trade saris in India. So you come to Faridpur infrequently. Yes. This is better. I've been in India for long, hence my dialect. Subhash Das. And... let my home be Basirhat? You see... in case someone asks I'll be able to answer easily. But the Sari trade is a must. Say that you carry Taant, Tangail, Jamdani, various kinds of saris to India. Like my father. Yes. Erm... I mean, 'Jee'. Jee. You've got guts. Why? You had the guts to bring a stranger...- - To my home? What else could I have done? Leave you to die? It's not as if only your women are brave, Naser Bhai. You're my guest now. To send you back to India absolutely unharmed... is my duty. And a guest is considered equivalent to God in Bangladesh. You're talking about guts? I wouldn't resolve to live in this house alone otherwise. Hey! Get up!- - What happened? Come on! Wow. Beautiful breeze. What happened? Quiet! Sit! What is it? Just sit here quietly! Don't make a sound! He's here! Starting the Bijoya greetings with your blessings. I've hired confectioners. Naru, Nimki, Jalebi... they'll make them all. I'll bring them tomorrow. Bijoya greetings. Started my Bijoya greetings with uncle's blessings. He's like my father. Baba is long gone now. Here.- - Oh yes! Try to keep the doors and windows open. Without light and air, he will die of suffocation! Shubho Bijoya. Would you like to eat...- - Not at all! The glass of water is enough. Uncle, I will see you soon. See you. See you. Where did you go so early in the morning today? To the market.- - That early? It gets crowded later.- - You should've told me. I've told you so many times. See you. Okay.- - Oh yes, listen. When I was coming, Lakshmi asked me why I wear white all the time. What can I tell her? How would she know the significance of white? Some wear white because they've lost everything. And some, because they can't get what they want. See you. But I do have a lot of printed shirts. I've preserved them with naphthalene. In case I need them later. See you. Liyakat Chacha (Uncle)!- - May Allah bless you. Bijoya greetings!- - Okay. What is it, dear? What was so urgent? Wait! Who's ill? Chacha, Baba had a breathing problem last night. Can you please check once? It's him? That's a relief. Please go check.- - Yes, let's go. He has aged, you see. These things are obvious. Okay. Even my wife hasn't been doing well for sometime. Chacha, give me your bag.- - Okay. Here, take it. Please come. What happened? Any trouble? I can't understand anything. - - Yes. You've piled upon me. How will it look if someone from my family says the wrong names! Learn the names properly. Ganesh-babu will be back soon. You've to become Subhash Das by then! Okay... Who is this Ganesh-babu? Learn the names I've already told you first! Listen, you must eat properly. He refuses anything I serve. Even a bowl of puffed rice. This can't go on! You think medicines alone are enough? Stop bothering the girl and eat what she gives you. This remains the same. Okay. Oh Allah! Come on. Doctor Chacha, there's something else. I have my own problems... And a cousin arrived today. His van overturned into a drain, and he's hurt his leg. Where's he?- - Inside, in the room. Please check him once.- - Let's go in. Come. Doctor Chacha is here. The pond and the garden should be at least two acres. More than that. How long will Ramen-babu live? After him all the property is hers. Why did you stop? No matter how high the vulture flies, its eyes are set on the debris. All you notice is the property, not how she nurses the man. How would you understand?- - You too don't need to. Why? After waiting for all these years, she'll go back to her father at Faridpur. Picture... the end! What are you thinking? Your bad luck takes off from mythology. Why? Your name is Ganesh Mondol. Lord Ganesha.- - So? Just like Lord Ganesha, you'll only get a banana tree for a wife. No fracture. Only a sprain. Otherwise you wouldn't have let me touch it. Heat up some lime and turmeric. Apply it twice a day. It will take care of both the swelling and the pain. I'm prescribing a painkiller. Take an antacid with it. You'd get a fracture if you fell into a cemented drain. So... what do you do for a living? I've a sari shop.- - Great. What did you get for your sister this time? Let's see? Surely not an ordinary sari? Padma, what's the colour of the sari he got you? Chacha, how long will it take him to start walking? Say, a week. Any addictions? Err... - Sometimes, with his friends. Don't do this, son! I saw this house fall apart because of an addict. Told him so many times... Ratan, don't drink all this. He never listened. In the end, he died of a rotten liver. And look at this girl... told her so many times. She too won't listen. How old are you anyway? Why not remarry? She won't listen. Holding onto memories. Whose memories? A drunkard's! Anyway. Talk to her! Make your sister understand. Okay? Make her see sense. See you. I wish I could leave behind my home, my land Beloved, just for you Beloved, it's just for you That my body yearns Chacha. Here. Don't act smart now. Sit her down and talk to her. This is not her age to wear white clothes. Times have changed as well. Make her understand. I wish I could leave behind my home, my land Beloved, just for you My lonely abode, amidst these unending forests My lonely abode, amidst these unending forests Neither brothers nor friends have I No one to inquire of me Neither brothers nor friends have I No one to inquire of me Beloved, it is for you Beloved, it is for you That my body yearns I wish I could leave behind My home, my land Beloved, just for you Everything alright? Yes. Do not come out after 9 pm. Do you understand? Okay. Come on. Bhabani-babu, the list for Lakshmi Puja is ready. Let's discuss the main Lakshmi Puja now. Main Lakshmi Puja? Do you always need a literal explanation. Don't you get it? Marriage. Matrimony! Wedlock! Whose marriage? Good Lord! Ganesh-babu, it's better you tell him directly. I'm losing my temper. - - Listen. Chuck the list of unholy months and tell me, why can't a man marry whenever he wants? If both, the man and the woman say yes, how dare your calendar object? It's not objecting...- - Oh surely it is! No wedding dates in autumn! What to do if someone feels like marrying in autumn? Err... that means... erm- - What is it now? Look, our holy books don't object. But the thing is...- Look! He starts whining again! Is she very young?- - Yes! She's young at heart. But her age would be say... - - Err... forty. Don't exaggerate! She must be thirty-six. No problem. As long as she has bled no objection at all! May I know the bride's name?- - Her name is...- - The banana tree! Hey you!- - Hari, Dada is calling you! Ever seen a buffoon? This one. Bijoya greetings!- - Bijoya greetings. Does the bulb at your yard stay lit all night? I cross that path daily. Always wanted to ask. Yes. Why? Get a CFL bulb. Saves electricity. Where to? To the shop.- - Dailies? Yes.- - What do you need? A soap. Really? Is that why you are going? Do you know my actual name? Debdoot (Godsend). I always arrive on time. Here you go. Keep it! You're in luck. Had gone for Ganesh-babu's monthly provisions. Please! What are you doing! Why look at the price? Just enjoy the fragrance. Do you want to land me in trouble? Need anything else? No. Bye. Okay. Bye. Gave her a bath soap. Good job. Now come back. What's going on, huh? How long will the setting up take? When will I send the sweets? Stop laughing and hurry up! You can't take so much time! Lakshmi!- - Coming, Dada! How will the blood pressure pills help? These idiots have done nothing yet! What is it, Dada? Listen, did Lau give you a list of names where the sweets are to be sent? Yes, he did! I don't know what, but it's a long piece of paper! Okay, go get the paper. Why are you staring at me? Get it fast! Okay! The collar is stained because of the medicine. It's alright. I'll give you another one without a collar. Can't this be washed off? Not all stains can be washed away. Let's see. Whose clothes are these? The man you see with me in the photograph. Ratan Haldar. The stench of smoke and alcohol could never be washed away. Here... Does this wound hurt? Not a wound. It's a birthmark. My father has one on his shoulder too. Okay. After he passed away, I thought I'd give away his clothes. Couldn't. I opened this trunk after ages. Finally I could put them to some use. Sorry. I spoilt the shirt. How can you spoil a dead man's shirt? Bijoya greetings again. Here. May God bless you with good health and peace of mind. Naru, Nimki, all in here. There's Jalebi, Goja... An assortment. Oh my! This is blood! Whose shirt is this? My brother's. Brother? But I thought you were the only child! My uncle's son. Arrived yesterday. For Bijoya greetings. His van fell into the drain near the post office. Oh Allah! He hurt his shoulder and leg. Oh no! Where is he? Inside, in the room. Inside? Poor thing! Good Lord! Subhash-da, this is Ganesh-babu. Ganesh Mondol. Is the pain increasing or decreasing? It's better. Gave him medication. It's better now. There's a swelling too. He's hurt his neck as well. Who prescribed the medication? Liyakat Shaheb? Yes. Liyakat Shaheb... He came yesterday... Okay, now I get it. He is a very funny old man! A bit garrulous... but his medicines do magic! Very good doctor! Give me the prescription. The one he wrote! Okay. Yes. You're quite serious. Man of few words. Here.- - Where's your hometown? Your hometown?- - Gopalganj. Faridpur. Nice. Subhash Das. Did you get the medicines? Yes. For today. Only for today? Why! Why would you go to the medicine shop everyday? Don't worry, I'll have them sent to you. You are our guest here, at Sripur. Your Dada is like a brother to me as well! Don't worry. Take rest. I'll come and check on you anytime! I must buy you a mobile phone now. You're the only one in the village without one. Just one call and I could send the doctor, the medicines! Lau is jobless anyway! Sleeps through the day like an old hen. I'd send him. Actually... you... you always ignore me. You never try to understand the inner meaning of my words. I'm getting old, you see. I feel very sad. Maybe this is my destiny. What can I do? Look at you now! The face you've made... as if I'm speaking Japanese and you can't understand a word! Hey... See you. He took the prescription with him! Yes. He will send all the medicines. Now that he knows, he'll leave no stone unturned. Is he generally helpful or is this only for you? Let's go ask everyone! Remember this: no one does anything for free these days. That's not true. You're doing so much for me, what motive could you have? Don't you see... Dressing you up in his clothes... and playacting the role of a wife. Here. You're usually quite excited after you visit her. Why are you quiet today? What's this? Mr. Subhash Das... who is this? Dial Dr. Liyakat. You won't say anything. Only order around. As if I'm your servant. Oh well I really am! She has a guest. A cousin. He fell off the van, hurt himself. It's ringing. Give it to me. Hello, doctor... you must come to my place once. No hurry at all. Today, tomorrow, day after... anytime. Don't delay much though. It's you who'll feel guilty if something serious happens to me. The same thing. Pressure. Mental pressure, work pressure... it's all piling up. Here, you'll need this. Where'd you find this? It's Baba's. He no longer walks. I try to make him sit up sometimes. Some more veggies?- - What? Vegetables?- - No. I've had enough. You must eat now. I will eat later. You finish first. At home, they probably think I'm dead by now. Subal too fell into the water with me. We both were holding the idol from behind. The idol is balanced on two boats. The boats slide away and the idol falls off into the water. I never thought the boat would topple over! I guess I lost balance. The huge idol fell on me. I hurt my shoulder. I don't remember a thing after falling into the water. This is the third time you're repeating this story. Eat, the rice is getting cold. Come on. Jee. Nothing to hide from me, why say 'Jee'? No, you see... I need to send a message home. Amma (mother) must be refusing food. I know. Abba, though, is very strong. But the BSF must be looking for my body over there. And Abba will be sitting on the riverside. Won't say a word. He'll just sit there quietly. - - Who else is there at home? No one else. My older brother drives a taxi in Kolkata. There is someone else... God knows what she's up to. Hope she doesn't do anything stupid. Listen, if you can't get through to my home, please try Kashinath-da's number. If you can inform him... But if anyone else receives the call, don't say anything! And if I give you another number... Ayesha's number. Tell her that I... I will surely return. Tell her to inform Kashinath-da. Kashinath-da has a huge business. Import-export. He stays in Bangladesh most of the time. He knows people here, he'll surely arrange for something. - Tell me the number. Huh?- - The phone number. Yes... 77. And don't forget to put another 91 before that. Ayesha Khatun. Okay? Anybody home? Anyone? Hello? Anybody home? Anybody... I better go now. I'll come back later. It's you. Did I wake you up? Okay, I'll come back later. No, please. I dozed off.- - No, please take rest. Lie down. Isn't she home? No idea. Tell her I'd something important to say, I'll come back later. She must've gone somewhere. She'll be back. Please have a seat.- - Should I? Okay, if you insist. You don't sound like you're from Faridpur at all. I stay in India most of the time. It's been fourteen years.- - But still... One can still make out. But you can easily pass off as an Indian. I've tried to speak Bengali like them so many times. But can't fool them... "You're from Bangladesh?" They'll catch you. But yours is the correct accent! Did you take the medicines I sent? Jee, thank you. Why are you thanking me? Hey... Are you married? I'm a bachelor too. We're better off, isn't it, Subhash-da? So... didn't you find a girl in India? Or have you put check posts on both sides of the river? I'm just joking. Please do not mind me. Okay? So, what do you do? Business. A small, teeny-weeny business. Oh. And you? Fish? I catch and sell fish. Small fish, big fish, deep water fish... I catch them and sell them. Do you understand 'Meen'? Baby lobsters. They look like thin strings. You can't even see them with naked eyes. Those strings grow up to become jumbo prawns, tiger prawns. They sell out for a huge price! So, there's no such thing as a 'small, teeny-weeny' business. See you, then? So, how long do you plan to stay? I had come for a day. Have a lot of work back home. It's my leg. I'll leave when it heals. What's this? She applied some lime and turmeric on it. Wonderful. I'm off. Am I dead? Got you the medicines, can't I do this much? Why must a married woman have to step out so late? The BGB are everywhere. Why invite unnecessary attention? They live without families for months. Keep that in mind. I know you won't reply. I came by. To inspect Subhash-babu. We had a nice chat. You've put lime and turmeric on his leg... Good. It really works. Doesn't it? See you then? Tea? Err...- - Please come. There's no need. Listen. That won't be required. You work so hard all day. Buying grocery, taking care of the sick. Your offer has quenched my thirst. Hey... You understand it all. Why do you pretend not to? What? Why do you push me away? Have I ever even for a moment made you feel uncomfortable? Or shirked any responsibility since Ratan passed away? Then? Why do you chicken out when you see me? You know that I'm powerful, well-connected. I could marry anyone. But I didn't. I'm waiting. If I marry, I'll marry the one I desire. Otherwise I won't. I'll serve tea. Please come. Wait! Please don't do this to me! I'm older than you. I confess, it is impossible for me to marry anyone else in this life. I promise, I won't touch alcohol after marriage. The truth is... I can't tell this to everyone... I can't go on living alone anymore. What if I keep waiting... and die a bachelor! That would be very embarrassing! Do you see? Look! Look! I'm crying like an idiot! I'm tired of myself! What have you bought? Are those for me? Why? Did I make a mistake? That's not what I meant. Here. Keep this. How did you know I smoke? It is I who washed your muddy clothes. In your pocket... there were some Indian cigarettes and a match box. Obviously I can't get you those. You've got to manage with this. This is the brand I know of. You're doing so much for me. I'm just a stranger... but you are feeding me, taking care of me. Called your home. Spoke to your father. Really! What did he say? How is he? Everyone was crying. They assumed they'll never find your body. When I asked your father to inform Kashinath-babu, then he believed me. Asked me to call in the morning again to speak to Kashinath-babu. They call you 'Montu' at home? And... did you... speak to Ayesha? Yes, I did. Oh. And? She was crying so much, she couldn't speak. Handed the phone to someone else. I told everything to this person. A man or a woman? Huh? A woman. Oh. Probably Reshmi. Do you have a match box? Sure. They're very close friends, always together. With Allah's grace Kashinath-da will be informed properly. I've given them my address. What are you looking at? Nothing. Erm... You're wearing this shirt all day. There's one over there. Change it. Change it. Subal da, how much? Here. Leave it. I will write it down. You know I'm not allowed to take money from you. Carry on. Here. If it goes on like this I will go to Masood's shop from now. Please! You think Masood is allowed to take money from you? All the best! Chacha, my things. - - Right. Here you go. How much, Chacha? Sixty-two years, dear. Didn't ask your age. Stop joking. Tell me the amount. I've packed a digestive powder for Ramen da. Soak it overnight and give it to him in the morning. Fine. But first tell me how much? I'm not giving it to you for free. Why worry? Lau clears up the dues every month. Go. Can't fight the crocodile if you're in water. Now, come on. Go! Hari has come to meet his lover My dear, what else could make you happier? Sweatheart, please don't remain annoyed with Madhava Please sit. Please keep reading. Okay. Your beautiful breasts deep and luscious, as a Doub Palm fruit, why let them go in vain? I have told you time and again, do not deprive the ever beautiful Hari Are you getting late, Liyakat Shaheb? One can't stop in the middle of such luscious description! I shall explain to you one day. Then you'll understand what the word 'luscious' means here. Doctor, please come here. You can't examine the patient or the illness from there. Please sit. It's pretty apparent. Your blood pressure is high. When do you sleep? Depends on my mental state. If I'm too disturbed, I sleep at around 3 or 4 am. Otherwise, at least at 1:30 am. Don't do this! Try to sleep early. Sleeplessness escalates any sort of illness. I get no sleep on that huge bed alone, Chacha. Miss someone next to me... for a chat, for this and that. How long can I keep watching the ceiling fan? This has only one remedy. Marriage. Find yourself a suitable life partner. The pressure will come down. You'll also sleep on time. Look, I don't mind a social-welfare kind of a marriage. Say a helpless, lonely widow. I'd be happy to help her. That would soothe her plight as well as mine. Oh Allah! How many think so deeply, tell me? Well... why don't you... no, forget it. Why did you stop? Go on, go on! Err... Ramen Haldar's son, Ratan? Yes, I met you at his place that day. Go on to the next line now. Err... Ratan's widow. What's her name? I keep forgetting these days. What's her name? Can't remember names of women, Chacha. Oh yes, I remember! Her name is Padma. 'Padma', is it? Nice. The name of our river. You can be her saviour, Ganesh. She is a very sober girl. Hasn't deserted her ailing father-in-law to be with her parents. You're treating her brother's leg. You must be visiting often for check-ups. Why not shove me in between his legs one of these days? If she's okay with it, I'm good too. No problem. They always create a fuss over my smoking at home. You're doing exactly the opposite. Told you that day... no one does anything for free. But what motive could you have here? I do have. My heart skipped a beat the moment I stepped into the yard. Why? The smell of the smoke. Like old times. He smoked four packets a day. Anyway, leave it. Kashinath-babu took all the information from me. He asked me not to call anymore. He'll make all arrangements when it is time. That was an ISD call. You're spending so much. And then the cigarettes, fruits, food... Drink the tea. It's getting cold. No but it's true. I'll do something. We have people coming here frequently. Once I'm back in Basirhat, I'll send in some money. I may come down myself as well. I'm Subhash-da now. No one will say anything. Hope you're keeping an account of the expenses? Come on! You're getting me wrong. But you are absolutely right. How much do I make with the little bit of stitching I do? I've two mouths to feed. And now you're here too! No idea how long you'll be dependent on me. How will I manage? Do one thing. Keep it at eighty-five rupees per day, okay? Hey! You've really got me wrong! I didn't mean that! Listen to me! You idiot! This is an ISD. An Indian number. That's what I'm saying! It's a fact! What nonsense, why'd she call India? She only makes calls to her father's place in Faridpur. She might have called Gopalganj to inform about her brother. But I clearly asked for her bill. And he gave me this. And you brought this to me? Strange! Shouldn't you have checked the number? Where'd she go from there?- - Home. Stopped to buy cigarettes. Give me the bill. For the brother. The call must be for her brother too. But we must stay alert, Lau! Moving around too much, isn't she? Do one thing! You... go to the booth again. Check the calls made before and after that time. 11:35 am. I asked for her phone bill. I was told it was fifty-two rupees. Err... but it's correct. See? 11:35 am. Fifty-two rupees. Indian phone number. Where did I go wrong? I really did not... mean it like that. Anything else? If eighty-five rupees per day is too much for you, give me sixty. I can't make do with any less. Why are you going on with it? Told you, I didn't mean it like that. Then why bring up money? Because I felt bad. I'm getting all privileges. You're doing so much for me. Shouldn't I feel uneasy... feel awkward? If you feel awkward, go away. Who has stopped you? You know very well it's not so easy for me to go away in this condition. You've saved my life, so you have the right to insult me. You never eat in front of me. How much you cook, how much you eat, I understand it all very well. I know very well how much you make from stitching. Have I said anything wrong? Would it be better if I stayed mum and enjoyed the privileges? It didn't suit you well that I tried to be fair! I've a business of my own, I earn. My people come to this country often from that side. You've done so much for me. As a friend I tried to... What now? Does this look familiar? Where did you find this? It was tied to your waist! I thought this was gone! One lac, thirty five thousand. Didn't need a single penny from here for my guest. Take it. I'm giving you respect. You must respect me too. And you dare to comment on my poverty? I never asked you... why you had so much money on you on an immersion day. Hey! I'm wearing white! Fine, I'll come later.- - No! Come. It hurts to see you get startled every time you see me. I start hating my face, my body! I know I am ugly. It's natural that I scare you. But what can I do? Ganesh Mondol doesn't have the ability to change his appearance. And you too must understand, just as there are good looking people who are dishonest and bad, there are also ugly people who are good at heart. I'm an example. Why had I come here... Why did I come?- - You would know. Why did I come... Oh yes, right! Please listen, I remember now! It is the day of Lakshmi Puja. I shall send some sweets and food from the offering I make to God. No need to cook. You won't come if I invite anyway. And now your brother's here too. It's okay, don't come. Just imagine my bad luck. My sister's name is Lakshmi. I'm worshipping Goddess Lakshmi's idol at home. But no real Goddess at home. Listen, I've bought ten thousand rupees worth of fireworks for kids. Don't mistake it for action near the border. Tell me, is everthing alright? If you need any kind of help do not hesitate to tell me. Understand? Goddess Lakshmi returns to us To your home and mine The untarnished woman prays to Her To fulfil her desires Goddess Lakshmi returns to us To your home and mine The untarnished woman prays to Her To fulfil her desires If you pray to Her No matter what caste and creed Goddess Lakshmi will bless all with health and wealth Goddess Lakshmi returns to us To your home and mine The untarnished woman prays to Her To fulfil her desires Like the evening of spring, A light, pretty sky Slow and calm Flows the sweet breeze Lau, what are you waiting for? Put the food and offerings up there. Yes.- - Keep it nicely. Be careful.- - Keep them on the bench. You wouldn't come. So I brought the idol here. Have you noticed? Lakshmi is carrying Goddess Lakshmi! Seek Her blessings. Okay. Whoever prays to her every Thursday Goddess Lakshmi washes her poverty away The chants for Lakshmi are honey to the ear Disease, sorrow, pain and poverty, are all put away It's done. Now you all can leave. Lakshmi, go home. Bhabani-babu, you too. Come on, carry the Goddess away with care. Let's go, everyone.- - Give this to me. Lau, you can go as well. Go. Come on kids, everybody. Now... for the monetary offerings to the Goddess. Here. Fifty-two rupees. Why this?- - Hold it. Take it. No... - - Please. Come on, take the fifty-two rupees. Keep it. And since you're an extremely important person in my life, I've brought a receipt too. The booth owner, Nizamuddin, owes me 10,000 rupees for two years. He's showing no inclination to pay back. Do one thing: make all your calls from Nizamuddin's booth. Don't pay a penny. Since you're making ISD calls to India, the debt will get paid soon. No problem! May I leave? Oh yes, another thing. I know I'm going around in circles but... If you fall into any trouble, don't hesitate to tell me. And how's Subhash-da? He's fine. Good. Ganesh-babu has come to know I called India. But how!? I can't spare the time to find out. Shameless! Shameless? You're falling into trouble trying to help me out time and again, Padma. Right. That's true. If you get caught, the BGB and the police won't spare me either. Just one phone call to your people and the entire story of Subhash-da will be an open lie! Please forgive me, Padma. I should've told you the truth on the very first day. Would've saved you the trouble. But I thought, what if you threw me out after knowing the truth? So I kept quiet. The story of the immersion is a lie. I didn't fall under the idol. We run our business from Taki. Kashinath-da? He's the owner. We smuggle goods. We buy goods from our country. And send them here. And... we take goods from here, label and sell them in India. We have unrestricted movement on the immersion day. The border along River Ichhamati is opened up. That's why. People come to Bangladesh from that side and Bangladeshis go to India. Heard of a boat toppling over that day? It was Indian. It was 4 pm. By the time I finished work, the border was crowded with BDR and police. I hid. I set sail after dark. But they had been informed. They chased us. How could our speed match up with a motor boat's? Finding no choice, I jumped into the river. Something hit me on the shoulder underwater. That's it. I don't remember anything after that. Nothing else. I was really scared, Padma. Really. So I couldn't tell you anything. You thought you saved a helpless Indian. But would you have done the same if you knew he's a smuggler? Sorry, Padma. Please forgive me! Who's this guy, Lau? His dialect has no trace of our local tone. Besides, he mostly lives in India. Not only so, makes calls to India as well. If we inform the BGB, his game's over. My civility has no value, Lau. The baby lobsters are growing into jumbo prawns and tiger prawns. You're in a tricky spot, Lau. I can get prawns for free. And I've got Lau (bottle gourd) too. If this guy escapes... I'll chop you up and cook you with prawns! Apart from pissing and dumping, you have only one job... Guarding the border. You are my BGB. Just bought some grocery. Thought I'd check on you. So? Mr. Subhash? How's your leg? Good. But without the stick...- - Walking is a bit tough, Chacha. Hey, will you be able to escape if a snake chases you? Sure. Yes, I'll hit the snake with this stick. Good... your patient is getting better. His brain is alert. Which means the body is healing. See you then? Please finish the entire course of medicines, son. Oh no! I completely forgot! On my way, I met this boy in front of Bhabesh's house. He was looking for directions. The envelope had your address on it. I asked him to come with me, since I was coming here. But he said, Chacha, if you're going there, please pass on the letter. I said, Okay, give. Here. - - Give me. See you, son. Last night... I couldn't sleep. Came and sat out here. What's up? Bad news? Letter for you. From Kashinath-babu. I was sure Kashinath-da would find a way! Day after, at 4:30 am, a boat will arrive at Biswaspara Funeral Ghat. Don't be late. Be careful. Kashinath-da. The name's Kashinath! So, Padma, how far is Biswaspara Funeral Ghat? Will I be able to walk till there with this wound? But I will have to go, Padma. Can something be arranged? Padma! What happened? What was that? From that room.- - What! Baba! Good Lord! Two banks of a river... If both are washed away You bloom into this marriage Of life and death, O heart! You bloom into this marriage Of life and death, O heart! Two banks of a river... If both are washed away You bloom into this marriage Of life and death, O heart! When they carry you away Swinging in a bamboo palanquin As the bearers lift you high Your life will heave a sigh With flaming logs of wood around Life gives up the care it found Your ashes reach the bank- Your home now, after marriage Your ashes reach the bank- The bride's new home You bloom into this marriage Of life and death, O heart! I don't respect you for no reason. You took care of Ramen-kaka till the last day. How nice of you. He was suffering anyway. Good that he is gone. You're absolutely free now. You're at a four way junction now. One leads to Faridpur, your father's home. One, to that dilapidated house. And one goes towards India, I'm certain. But there's another path that leads to my home. That's all I have to say. They'll lie you down Head towards the North Break your limbs to pieces, Uproot your very existence With sandalwood and ghee To feed the flames O heart, at first it burns your locks What burns first, O heart, Are your precious locks You bloom into this marriage Of life and death, O heart! Those rules are obsolete now. Please eat something. I'm not hungry. Come on. Or are you refusing food from Liyakat's Muslim household? Can anyone tell if I am Naser or Subhash? You... Just one more night. Once I take you to Biswaspara Ghat, I'm done. Did you call home? You must inform them. After I leave, you mustn't stay in this house alone, Padma. How old are you anyway? Go home and start a new life. The Padma is drying up, Subhash-da. Where's the water? These people won't... I've heard on the radio... They won't release the Padma waters. She's naturally drying up. The Padma Pact is to be blamed. Not me. It's not safe for you to stay in this house alone, Padma. You could fall into trouble. You've been so brave to save a stranger! And I... I can't see you wasted like this! Death would be a relief. Stop it! Don't think about all this! I will be worried for you even after I go back. My my! If you're so worried, stay back here. I'll get you a ration card. Can't wait to go back! Showing concern through empty words. 'Worried', really? Eat. Such an old inhabitant of our village. We must give him a proper funeral. Besides, Ramen-kaka was always so affectionate towards me. Look, how beautiful.- - Yes. See! Seems so lively! Isn't it? But don't we need to ask his family once? See... she's a helpless widow. We shouldn't bother her with all this. Bhabani-babu, do one thing. Give Lau the list of requirements for the funeral. He'll do the needful. Am I saying anything wrong?- - Not at all! Correct! That's it!- - Dada... What happened? Dada, she's here! Who? Yes! Should I bring her upstairs!? Okay. Call her. Lau, did you hear!? Take everyone downstairs and offer them sweets! Bhabani-babu, please go. Everyone, please eat the sweets and go home. Make it fast.- - Hurry up. Come on, let's go. Don't stop! Go! Make sure everyone eats the sweets quickly. Okay. Oh! Everyone, please come with me. Please go inside. Go in! Please come in. Why are you standing there? Have a seat. Sit. I knew it. I knew you would need me sometime very soon. Which is why I kept telling you, if you fall into any trouble don't hesitate to tell me. What's wrong? Tell me. What is it? Look at you. Please don't cry. Keep this in mind. As long as Ganesh Mondol is here, no one can harm you. Don't hesitate. You need to...- - Yes? You need to help me. Oh dear! What else have I been doing for all these years? You've no idea how important you are in my life! I've always dreamt that you'll come to this house and live here. My property, my business... All of this... it is all yours. I know these things don't matter to you. But even then. If you decide to push all the good fortune away, how can I help? You... you know very well... that... I don't believe in exerting power. Whenever I help you as an outsider, it affects my reputation. Ever given that a thought? Tell me frankly... And then I'll get you the moon. Do you accept then? Look... have a look at that calender. Those red circles... They are all probable marriage dates for us. The day you say 'yes', the very next date will be our day! Now come on, wipe your tears. And make your decision. No pressure at all! Decide with a calm mind. Do you accept? What is it? Do you? What? Yes. I... I accept! But... Where did that 'but' come from? I have a... I have one condition. What are you looking at? You keep telling me... someone like me shouldn't spend all her life in white clothes. This sari... This sari was given to me by my husband. From the Gajon Fair. A few of my... sleeping pills were lying here, Padma. Where did you keep those? I've taken them. Thank God I did. Or I'd have never understood... why the drunkard, Ratan, was so much into intoxication. Oh my goodness! My head... it feels so light! Like spun cotton! So this is why he used to drink so much! What else could he do? Chased by moneylenders. He had borrowed money from everywhere. The pressure of debt! All of it felt light. Look at me! I... I've to take you to the Biswaspara Ghat under the watchful eyes of the BDR! I'm not scared at all. What you did wasn't right, Padma. You're intoxicated. Humans are so weird! If men get intoxicated there's nothing wrong with it. But if women do it... you have so much to say, eh? What you did wasn't right! Why are you drinking, Subhash-da? Huh? You'll say drinking reduces pain. I don't feel pain anymore. If I knew this would happen, I'd never agree. Why did you need to get me this bottle? The need was mine, Subhash-da. Mine. You know why I got this? This is what he used to drink. The alcohol, the smell of his cigarettes... And during those days... I would wear these sarees. Printed ones. Just like this one. Open your mouth! Come on, open your mouth, breathe out!? Breathe out! See? Everything is like it used to be! Tomorrow... you will be gone, Subhash-da. And me? My life will have to go on! You... You're extremely upset today, Padma. Go on. After this... you may feel sick. You must... go to that room and sleep it off. Padma... can you wake up so early? So many sleeping pills! Only if I sleep at all. Padma will only sleep after your boat sets sail. Don't sleep tonight, Naser Ali. I won't ever see you again! Talk to me for a while. About... your India. About your home. About Ayesha Khatun. Come! Please come! Let's go. Lakshmi, look at the time! Stop the harmonium! This way. Come inside. Please sit here. - - Thank you. It would be better if we hadn't met. Why? I won't be able to forget you. The person who saved me... whether she dies or lives... I will never know! Padma, you have my telephone number. Will you call me? Won't you feel like inquiring? Not at all! So you won't be able to forget me, eh? The person who saved me, I will never get to know about her! You will go back to your country. You'll settle down there. Have kids. You'll forget everything. Don't worry, Naser-bhai. I will forget everything too. How do I look? Subhash-da? Hand it over to me.- - Okay. Here. Are you sure you want to do this?- - Go stand there. Go! Keep this. What's the name? At least tell me the age? Sit quietly for a bit, will you? Why are you jabbering away? Eat! Can't you see, I'm busy!- - Now eat! What? Can't find any similarity between... the righteous widow and the adulterous hussy? Eh? It's this picture you must remember. This will help you forget everything easily. What happened? O my love, O my love, he never let my love grow fertile O my love, he never let my love grow fertile He never let me wear his golden caress over my body O my love, he never let my love grow fertile Trust me... I'm not to blame! I'm not to blame at all! All the blame is... See him? That swine is to blame! Borrowed money. Drank himself to death. Killed himself. And... finished me too! I stitched the flags of both the countries myself. Does the Indian flag look nice? It's very beautiful! When I jumped into the water from the boat... I carried the Indian flag with me in my fist. My national flag! It'll be Bangladesh till the middle of the river. Remember to put up the Indian flag after that. Oh Allah! Padma, please remain as you are! Oh, please! You won't let the water into the Padma. How do I remain the same? Let's not talk about this. No! No way. You must not change at all, Padma. And if need be, wear those... white sarees all your life. You're late, Subhash-da! All my white sarees have been printed with colour now. I'm getting married to Ganesh Mondol. Gave him my word this morning. You don't have to worry anymore. I won't have any poverty to deal with. No misery. No drunkard, Ratan. No Naser Ali. No Subhash Das either. Padma Mondol is all that will remain. Why are you making that face? I never told you for once... that I did this to save you. I just... want some peace now. I've worked too hard. It's been a long struggle. I can't go on anymore. Hey... What are you doing! Leave me, come on! Leave me. Look at you! What are you doing! Look. It's 3 am already. Just one more hour. That's it. Hey... Will you go on like this? Or will you speak to me? Oh no! Couldn't you have taken my opinion once? No! Who are you? Why would I take your opinion? You think I'm your Ayesha Khatun... that you'll advise me and I'll obey? Who are you? A guest! Once the Goddess' idol is immersed... you must never turn back to see her. Never turn back. If you turn around, you'll see... how the beautiful Goddess Durga... has dissolved into the water, lost her colour, her bones jutting out. She'll turn into a pile of bamboo, straw and clay. Throw it all into the water. And leave. Go back. Don't look back! Not for once! Stop here. Stop. Give it to me. Wait here, I'm coming. His bag. Keep it. Be happy. One last request. Find yourself some other trade. These illegal ways don't suit you. Now that you've found a second life, make good use of it. Maybe you'll earn less. But don't steal. Pay my respect to your parents. And... This... Give this to... Ayesha. Tell her, her sister sent it. Now go. I promise... the secret love and affection I'm taking back from Bangladesh, this is my last sin. My last theft. Make it fast. Bye. Remember what I told you? Don't look back. Go. Go... Go away! We must go now. Don't worry. Looking very nice in this sari. You must have wept all night. There's so much affection in you. Anyway. Let's go. Come home and take rest. Come. Come home with me. Come. See you. Montu, listen! Montu, don't be naughty now! Montu!- - Maa! Don't be naughty! Get dressed! Come here! My sweet little boy! Here you go! That's it! Here we are! Look up! A face as bright as the moon! You're going to see the immersions, right? You'll get to see so many idols! Here. If you don't wear clothes, the BDR will catch you! Not BDR, BGB!- - All the same, Montu! Now come on, hurry up! Do you know who gave you this new kurta? Who?- - Your aunt! Lakshmi? Don't call her by her name! Call her 'aunt'! Yes, aunt.- - Wear it! Wow! Look at you! Our boy is looking like a prince! That's a lie.- - Montu! Son...- - Your father is here! Come down, son!- - Come on! Don't let him go near the water. Don't worry. I'm there. Now wear your shoes.- - Yes, wait. Good, you got the umbrella. The autumn sky is as whimsical as the human heart! I thought the rain would ruin the immersions. Why took you so long?- - Your son was learning a rhyme. Say it for your father! Whirr-whirr! Turns the wheel! Cling-clang! Glasses break! Whoosh-Whoosh! Blows the wind! Chug-chug! On the rail! Croak-croak! Froggies jump! Rat-a-tat-tat! Beat the drums! Swish-swash! Goes the whip!
