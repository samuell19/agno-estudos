Thank you. GREAT TIPPER: No Problem. God bless. (SIGHING) (PERCUSSIVE MUSIC) Hi, Jack. It's me, Bridget. You know. Yeah, yeah, hi. I saw you playing. It sounded really good. Thanks, thanks a lot, appreciate it. It's good to see you're still playing. What else have you been up to these days? Just stuff, things, you know. That's great. You know it really is good to see you. What's it been, 10 years now? Sounds about right. Well I'm sure you have some stories. A few. Well um, you know we should grab dinner sometime, you know, catch up. Yeah, we should, absolutely, sounds great. Well, what are you doing tonight? We're having lasagna. (LIGHT MUSIC) Just give me a few minutes. I gotta give the husband the 411. You can go ahead and park behind me. Okay. What the fuck am I doing here? Oh, Jesus Christ, holy shit. She's married, no big deal. She's just married. (SIGHING) (PIANO MUSIC IN BACKGROUND) All righty. So how do you two know each other? We were in school together. I told you about it. I don't remember a Jack. BRIDGET: Honey, I've mentioned him. Well, how did you meet? Mrs. Sullivan's class, third grade. Good year. Taught us how to write in cursive. Turns out they don't really do that anymore. I'm not really sure why that is. We didn't really get to know each other until high school. Freshman year, first game of the season. Football player? Drums and percussion. Musician, man of my own heart. Oh, you play? I dabble. Our football team wasn't too good, so most of the time Jack and I just mess around. PAUL: I take it you were in the marching band. I was. Three and a half years. How did you manage the half? I decided to dedicate some of my time to some other extracurricular activities. I took a semester of art. Ah. Wait, you hate football. Why were you at the game in the first place? Were you in marching band too? No, I was a cheerleader. Really? No. Yeah? Yeah, I was a cheerleader. Wow. I didn't realize you had the, uh, the, what word am I looking for? Coordination, you know? She was actually the head cheerleader. Really? The girl could move. So what is it you do, Jack? Meaning? Like work, what's your career? I play. You still banging away? Not as much as I'd like to but yes, I bang. Well when's your next show? I know we'd love to come out and see you, see you banging away at the drums, you know. And wouldn't that be great, sweetheart? Yeah, it would be. I'm actually between gigs right now. But I'll be sure to let you both know when I'm back on my feet. Yeah. I mean it must be tough, you know, keeping up with the business and consistently finding work. So who have you played with? What have you done? Uh, a few big name acts. Subbed in a tour or two. I've worked with a lot of up and coming talent actually. Most of which stalled out, but it's a process. Right, well I'm sure you're very talented. Like I said, between gigs. (PHONE BUZZING) Ooh, sorry this is work, I gotta take it. I'm sorry to cut the evening short but that was work. They need me out on the first flight out to Seattle. Tonight? I'm sorry. This guy gets it. If Phil Collins needed a replacement drummer, he'd be halfway around the world, you know? I'll be back in two days, okay? Jack, it was great meeting you. You too. I'll be just a minute. Fuck. Fuck. So, what's in Seattle? Uh the Freeman deal might fall through. They want me to do damage control. They need you in Seattle for that? I mean, I don't know what you want me to do. You know, they call me like this every so often. Oh my God, these fucking drawers, can we get a new thing please? Is he still downstairs by himself? Oh, come on, he's fine. Look, Bridge, I know you knew the guy like a decade ago. Paul, come on. He's fine, I know him. No, you knew him, that's what that is. You haven't seen him in like 10 years. He's not fine. Look at him, he looks like Charles Manson. Oh my god. When's the last time he had a shower? I smelled him from across the table. So judgemental. (CLASSICAL MUSIC) (ZIPPING) Have you seen my passport? No. (RATTLING) See what I mean? - These fucking drawers. - Fucking drawers. Ah, thank you. He's living out of a car. What the hell were you thinking inviting him here? Am I the only one that's sane in this relationship? (SCOFFING) He's a good guy. That's not fine. Good guy, I don't care what he is. He's homeless living out of his car. Why are you bringing him into our home? What the hell were you thinking? Why do you need a passport to go to Seattle? Look, I gotta go. I'm already late for my flight. Get him out of here. Homeless, what? He cannot stay. Jack, it was an absolute pleasure to meet you. Oh. You too, Paul. PAUL: Hopefully we can do this again sometime. Absolutely. PAUL: I need to get going. BRIDGET: Okay. Would you like some more wine? No, thanks. Thank you. Actually, I should probably get going. What, no, no, not already. It was great seeing you. I really appreciate the meal. After all this time, that's it? Just a slice of lasagna and a few glasses of wine? Come on, just one more drink. Well. I don't know. I wouldn't want to drink all your wine. I'm in a club. So, Jacky boy. Where have you been all my life? You know, around. What are the odds that we run into each other after all this time? Well, statistically speaking I'd say most of our high school class still lives in this town so eh, like 70-30 maybe? (CHUCKLING) Did you ever call? Excuse me? Me, did you ever call me? I mean, I tried. What does that mean, you tried? There was one night where I called you over and over again. But you never answered. You were probably at a party or studying in the library. Massive orgy. It was always a massive orgy or a gangbang up at school. Okay, those things sound fun too. Sorry. I just, I didn't want to be a burden and it seemed like a good idea at the time. I just wanted you to be happy. Well, mission accomplished. So how much does one have to make in order to afford a television with a curved screen? That is one of Paul's toys. He loves his toys. And what does he do? With me? For money. Oh, he's in finance. He's a consultant for some pretty high end clients. Hence him being called away from his loving wife in the middle of the night. And he finds the money worth it? It's a beautiful television. It's a great picture from anywhere in the house. I bet. So how did you two get together? What's the story? We're gonna need something much stronger for that. Okay. Lead the way. BRIDGET: All right. You know, the more you build up anticipation, it just, it hurts, so maybe you should tell the story. (LAUGHING) I'm sorry. I'm just trying to find my courage. Is it hidden within the vodka? Well. You know, I'm not too sure. But I will look for it. JACK: You're certainly doing a very thorough check. (LAUGHING) Okay, okay, okay. So the story of me and Paul. It was my junior year and I just finished my last finals, so me and a bunch of my girlfriends are going to the city. You know, drinks and a show. JACK: Theater? I was never really the theater type. We were looking for rock, something loud. Ooh, girl of my own heart. (LAUGHING) So anyway we ended up in this rundown dive bar, you know, the ones that the hipsters turn into an organic tea bar five years later. Anyway, it was taco Tuesday. So we were devouring tacos and downing margaritas like the tequila fountain was dry. How's the vodka fountain doing? (LAUGHING) That's answers my question. Go on, go on. Well. As we were enjoying our little slices of heaven these yuppies from Wall Street came up and for lack of a better term were trying to spit game. What'd they say? BRIDGET: That I can't really recall. Blacked out? No, they had had spicy tuna rolls from that sushi bar across the street. And their breaths collectively smelled like fish, tuna and spicy mustard. Ew, potent. He was like a knight. Gallant, brave. Did he challenge them to a duel? BRIGET: Um, no. He pretended to be my lover. Ugh. But it was enough to scare the yuppies off. Then he bought me my fourth margarita. What was it called? BRIDGET: What, where we met? Yeah, the bar, what was it called? Uh, the Alibi Room. No shit. What? I played there. BRIDGET: You played at the Alibi Room? Yeah yeah, absolutely. When were you there? What was the day? Uh, June 29th I think? You're joking, you're playing with me. You're pulling my leg, right? Why would you say that? Ah. I was there the day before. On the 28th I was there. That's when I played. That year? Yeah, that year, if I'm doing my math right. Fuck. You're right, definitely need something stronger for this. (LAUGHING) I should probably stop though before I'm too drunk to drive. (LAUGHING) I think you're already past that. I'm quite happy to say that I'm very capable of holding my liquor. In my mouth. (LAUGHING) So um, where are you staying these days? You know where. BRIDGET: Stay. I can't stay. Why not? JACK: You know why not. Give me one reason. The night is young. (LAUGHING) Oh my god. You're very convincing. Very, very good. I know. (CHUCKLING) The night is young. (SLURPING) Oh god. Okay. Bartender, more wine! (LAUGHING) (CRICKETS CHIRPING) Nothing could beat this. The quiet calmness of home. Remember prom night? Under the stars? Yeah. You were so nervous that night you puked in the bushes before you rang the doorbell. You saw that? Oh no. So, wow. Oh my God. (LAUGHING) What an odd night. Which part? The DJ that kept playing EDM or the stale salad and dry chicken they served us for dinner? I'd say the whole fiasco if we were being completely honest. Absolutely. Afterward wasn't so bad though. All we needed was a blanket and the waves to help us sleep. Well, if we're being completely honest, I think you should know, I was never intending us sleeping. That I knew. (LAUGHING) You've always been very observant. I tell everyone that. Everyone on the street. Is that another one of Paul's toys? No, that one's mine. It's kind of late in the season but if you wanna go swimming, we could borrow some of Paul's trunks. What are you doing? Nothing. It's all good. Jack? Jack! (LIGHT GUITAR MUSIC) (SPLASHING) What are you doing? It's not like you haven't seen all this before. I promise you, not much has changed. Maybe for you. Oh, come on. Some things are just more exciting in the nude. Right, how about this. How about we live tonight like it's the only night left to live. And what about tomorrow? We can worry about that later. But first, let's make it through tonight. It'll be great, I promise. The water's warm.

If you wanna shower or anything, the towels are in the closet. Oh, and if you want any pajamas or anything there's some new ones in the top drawer there. They were Paul's but he just never used them so they're all yours. Yeah. Um, so, I'm right down the hallway if you need me for anything. Good night. Yeah. Good night. Fuck! Shit. (SIGHING) Perfect.

Shouldn't I be asking you that? Oh, it's a very hard adjustment going from sleeping on the ground to sleeping on the clouds. I've slept in that bed, it's definitely not that soft. Oh, I beg to differ. You want some coffee? How about breakfast? BRIDGET: Now? Well it is technically the morning. What did you have in mind? Do you trust me? I think so.

(LAUGHING) I knew you'd like it. It's my specialty, I'm telling you. That cheesy eggs, yeah. (LAUGHING) You know, I used to go camping all the time when I was a kid with my cousins. They're all like 10 years older than me, so they took me under their wing and showed me the ropes, so to speak. I used to love those trips. We'd make smores and roast hotdogs on the fire. And pick blueberries, blackberries and whatever other color berry there is. And we'd just live off the land as best we could. Ah, I loved it. We'd stay out there for a week, sometimes two. We actually, we adopted this rule where once we ran out of toilet paper we'd head home. We did that 'cause this one time my one cousin, he got a... I get the point. (LAUGHING) Yeah, my parents always freaked out when we're on the freaking trip. They're the kind of people that they always want everything planned out, you know, mapped to a T. Not me though. I loved every second of that. Ooh. (LAUGHING) Ow! JACK: You okay? - Burned yourself? - Yeah. It's hot. Try mine. But be careful. (GROANING) Yup. I told you. I warned you. I never thought things would ever be better than they were on those trips. And were you right? Answer's still pending. I'll have to let you know. So um, how long have you been homeless? JACK: I have a home. Your car. It's a roof over my head. That's enough. Is it? So you still as limber as you used to be? Excuse me? You know what I'm talking about. Listen, I know I look great for my age but trust me, mostly smoke and mirrors. I can't do any of the stuff we used to do. Well, most of it. There's some things. Hmm, let's find out. I like it, you have the spirit. (MUMBLING) By all means, please. Oh I'm gonna love this. Yes! Are you ready? Okay. (SIGHING) Go Big Blue! Go Big Blue! Go Big Blue! Go Big Blue! Whoah, fire, fire. - Woo! - Oh my god. That was frightening. Wow. Girl, you are ready for ESPN prime time. BRIDGET: Easy there, Tiger. I need a break. Low stamina. (LAUGHING) I have never had that problem. (TAPPING) I always wondered how you did that. What? BRIDGET: Your fingers. Oh, uh. I just kind of do it. Could you teach me? JACK: How to tap your fingers? Yes. (LAUGHING) Really? Ooh, yes. Teach me. JACK: Ah wow. BRIDGET: Come on. Ah, all right. Two minutes. BRIDGET: Two minutes? JACK: Two minutes. Where are you going? JACK: Don't burn yourself. (GRUNTING) Nice bongo. Actually, it's called a Djembe. Bless you. No, no, that's, you're hilarious. You're so funny, so cute. Oh teach me your ways, wise master. So. The Djembe, what you're gonna do is take the meaty part of your hand, hit it there, right. The meaty part, you know, like palm. Just give it a smack there like that. See? So you get that sound. Take your fingertips. Hit this part. BRIDGET: Completely different sound. Completely different sound, yeah. And you just kind of put it together. (PERCUSSIVE MUSIC) Those, those are the basics. (LAUGHING) Yeah, I think you figured it out. I mean, so what you're doing wrong is, so the power doesn't come from the hit. It comes from your wrist and your fingertips. So you wanna use your wrist and your fingers and just, so when you bring your hand down, use your wrist. Like that. But let the drum like, let the drum work. See what I mean? Bring it back up. It rings out. You get it. We'll get there. Work in progress. That's it, just use your hands like that. Finesse. (LAUGHING) What about this? What about that? You're doing better already. See, I couldn't do the cheering thing. I could teach you. But we'll save that for another time. We could do some handstands. It will be educational. What about this? (RATTLING) No, that's just nails on ooh chalkboard, it's uh. Please don't. (BANGING) (LAUGHING) Am I torturing you? No, not at all. It's good. BRIDGET: I miss it. Me too. (LIGHT MUSIC) Just give me a minute. BRIDGET: Where did you go? Philadelphia, Boston, L.A. A short stint in New Orleans. That's not what I meant. Why didn't you come back? What was I supposed to come back to? Me. You could have came back to me. You didn't want me to come back. You're right. I wanted you to stay. (SNIFFING) Come with me. I wanna show you something. It's roomier than it looks. Come on. This is it. This is my life. My home. This is where my path has led me. If I could do it again I would have stayed. Yeah but, this led you back here to me. So what are we supposed to do now? I don't know. (SIGHING) You know, for a housewife, you sure can party like it's 1999. First of all, I'm not a housewife. I'm in marketing. And secondly, we were kids in 1999. Our kinds of parties were pin the tail on the donkey and a pinata. Well, I still party like that. (LAUGHING) I never thought that going after something I love, something everyone says impossible, that that would backfire me so spectacularly. I gave everything I had to music. My life. That's why there was never a plan B. I had nothing left to give to it. Why didn't you just come home? My parents. They said that if you go, if you do this, you don't get to go home. They couldn't have meant that. Well. If I ever find them, I'll be sure to let you know. Yeah, through the good and bad, it was always okay though. And one thing always held true. What's that? I'm a nomad. I have no home, no place where I belong. Part of me feels like it's always been that way. Except for the moments I had with you. Shall we play a game? (LAUGHING) You just war games'd me. Okay. Okay, let's play a game. (LAUGHING AND COUGHING) Where did you get this shit? (LAUGHING) It taste like high school gym class. Are you sure about this? Okay. I'll get the beer. Do you remember that guy that used to throw all the parties when we were kids? Yeah. Danny? Danny, yes, oh my god that kid was crazy. I remember like getting blackout drunk was just a physical challenge for him and he always won. Whatever happened to him? I actually saw him a year or two ago. He lives in Vegas now. And he manages people's finances. Danny? People actually trust him with their money? Yes they do. Well, I remember his parties being insane. Never a dull moment. So, when's the last time you played this? Honestly, probably not since sometime in college. Oh, so what you're saying is you're out of practice. If my memory serves me correctly I used to kick your ass without even aiming. Oh okay. I can see that you certainly have the cups, that's nice, those are nice, oh good. But more importantly. Do you have the balls to back that up? I do. And my balls are nicer than yours. (CLACKING) (LAUGHING) Mmm. Thanks for throwing your balls in my eye. I appreciate that. (LAUGHING) I'm high as a motherfucker. We should play. Ugh. BRIDGET: And you still suck. Unbelievable. You're like the rainman of Beer Pong. (LAUGHING) You know, there's something very wrong about us playing this in this room. It is far too fancy for the little red cups, and whatever cheap light beer this is. Jack, it's a dining room. Who the hell needs a dining room? Hmm. Does Paul feel this strongly against the use of dining rooms No, he loves this stupid room. Perfect for big family gatherings. Oh, he has a big family? No, he's an only child. And his parents live in Arizona. He sees this vision of our life and I just don't know if I feel the same way. I don't see it the way he does, I don't think. How do you see it? I don't know. Okay. How does he see it? Oh you know, the whole leave it to beaver thing. You know, housewife, rugrats. The home cooked meal when he gets home from work. You forgot the glass of scotch waiting for him when he came through the front door. Yeah well, I don't really think housewife is my style. No it's not. Well, we have a more pressing matter at hand. I'm not gonna drink this shit anymore. Because it's gonna make me puke. Okay, sorry. Simple solution. How about we switch back to vodka? Okay, that sounds good, right? BRIDGET: Sure. And that rug over there is calling to me to go and pass out and just relax. I've had enough of the games. All right, sounds good. I can't wait for you to join me. (HUMMING MUSIC) (SLURPING) (SIGHING) So you went into marketing. Just like you always wanted. Sort of. Sort of, what do you mean sort of? Just, I wish I was a little further along by now. I did work on one ad campaign though. Yeah, what was it for? I don't think you'd know. Why not? I got television in my car. I'm just kidding. I barely have working FM radio. (LAUGHING) No really, what was it? It's called Volcano Chips. Hey is that the one with the guy who's drinking water on the floor next to the dog? Yeah. That is the one. I loved that song. That jingle is fantastic, it's so 80s.

Oh, fuck that. No, I'm writing them a letter. Several letters and I'm demanding more. I might even sing for them. Please, don't do that. You'll get me fired. I'm a drummer and singing is not my forte. Yeah, but, it's still cute when you do. You know, I still have the tape. No you don't, no. I do. Nah, mmm-mmm, impossible. No way, I burned them all.

I haven't been doing too great in that department as of late. Well we found each other. That's pretty lucky, right? Yeah. A little too lucky. Have you been following me?

It was fun. Yeah, but, those other guys were never gonna last. I know, I knew it. You play when you can play. Yeah, I guess. When I didn't hear from you at school, I always kind of wished you'd given it up. Why? 'Cause then maybe I would have still had you. Why are you doing this? Why am I here? I saw you at that park.

How does it feel to slowly lose who you are? I know who I am. Oh yeah? What did Paul want? He was just calling checking, see if you're being a good little wife? Yeah you must be really unhappy with this perfect real life you have. I wanted this. I wanted all of this, I wanted a house, the pool, all the fancy toys. Is that all you care about, this superficial bullshit? No, I care about you. I should have had you. We should have been together. But I made a choice, a decision. I thought it'd bring me back here, back to you but it didn't. 'Cause I failed. My parents knew, they always knew. That's why they threw me to the wolves. You knew. That's how you got here with Paul and all this. What's so great about this? You know at work, I'm fighting and clawing just to be heard.

Good morning. Coffee? Oh, yes. - Which one? - I don't care. - Okay. - The fuller one. Take the blue pill. You know, you should be a housewife. You're good at it. I could actually get used to doing this every morning. Coffee delivered every morning? I'll take it. I'll keep that in mind. Paul never delivered coffee in bed? Are you really gonna talk about him? Sorry, sorry. I didn't mean to crush the mood. Where are we gonna go from here, though? Well. It looks nice out. We can go for a morning swim. Excuse me? Yeah. It's one of my favorite ways to start the day. Just like last night was one of my favorite ways - to end the day. - You wanna go swimming now. Well, that wasn't too bad, yeah. But shouldn't we, I mean, we should. We'll worry about it later. So yes, swimming? After this cup of coffee though? Well, after last night, I think coffee's a good idea. Actually, you got any crack lying around? (LAUGHING) (LIGHT GUITAR MUSIC) Come on, come in! The water's nice. JACK: All right, here I come!

JACK: What do you want me to say? I want you to say that you're staying. And that we're gonna find a way to make this work. How can I? The entire time I was out there all I'm thinking is I'm invading someone else's world. Their life. Jesus. You have a life here. And my fate was decided a long time ago. It's hard, and it's definitely not pretty but it's mine. And I can't forget that. I'd still have a life. But you'd be in it, it'd be better. I can't. This isn't our happy ending. I want it to be, but, it's just not. I don't belong here. If we're together, I'm just gonna tear you down with me. We'll end up in that car together. But at least we'd be together. Call Paul. Just tell him, tell him the truth. Don't lie. Tell him what happened. He can give you something I never could. I should have never let you go. (HUMMING MUSIC) (SIGHING) (LIGHT GUITAR MUSIC) BRIDGET: Get out of the car. Bridget? Get out of the car. You at least owe me that. Look. You were right about me. What do you mean? I found you. I knew you'd be in that park and I found you and I followed you there. I guess I really was your own personal stalker. I needed to know that you were okay. I need to know what happened to you. But what I didn't realize is that I'm not okay. And for so long now everything's felt wrong. And I didn't know what it was. Until last night. Til I found you again. I made a mistake. What are you talking about? (SIGHING) Here. Just know that I was wrong.
