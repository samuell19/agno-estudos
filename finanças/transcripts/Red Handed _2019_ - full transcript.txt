It was 30 years ago, almost to the day, that I took my three boys down to the Sazarac River. I had grown up on that river fishing for steelhead with my brother, Reynolds. I never spoke to my brother again after what happened. They say that history repeats itself. But it doesn't. Not exactly. History rhymes. I always said it was over my dead body that I would ever go back to the Sazarac. Well, that's exactly what it did take for me to go back in the end. My dead body. You want me to help you? No, I'm okay. I still got one good hand. How is that wife of yours doing, uh, Lauren or Laura? What's her name again? - Laurel. - Yeah, yeah, how's she doing? She's uh, doing better. She still drinkin'? Um, she's doing... Well, you know, you can lie to your wife and you can lie to the cops and you can lie to your mistress, but don't lie to me, don't lie to your old man, all right? I pick her up from treatment on Tuesday. Oh, the 28 day things? I know, I just... I warned you about her. I knew it was gonna be an I told you so thing. Well that's exactly what the fuck it is, it's an I told you so 'cause I did tell you so. Listen, you wanna help me with this, I... Yeah, I'll do the air filter thing... Just put the fucking thing in, would ya? Here. So you had Louie the whole time that she was doing her 28 days? You got to hear the stuff outta this kid's mouth. Like what's he saying? Dad, I would like you, even you killed me on accident. What? Better figure that one out. What about your brothers, do you ever talk to them? Gus, yeah, I don't know, I talk to him he's, you know. What about the other one? No, I haven't, no I haven't heard from Pete. Why don't you talk to your brothers? Hey, Louie! Show Papa that picture of the crocodile. Well, you know, he's your son. He is your boy and uh, when a man has a son it's like it's almost a second chance at life you got an amazing thing, it's a gift, it's a. You'll always have it, you'll always have that one thing. Hey, Louie! Get down from the car, we got to go. Okay, all right, I got to go. Okay, sure. Okay. Hey, Louie, come on, I don't want you to miss baseball. See ya, buddy. Bye, Papa. See ya. You are just the man I wanted to see. I'm having a lot of car trouble. What kind of trouble's that? She just keeps gurgling every couple miles, I really don't know what's wrong with her. Gurgling. Yeah. Can I have one of those? Sure, have that one. Thank you. I'd be really grateful if you could take a look. You think you can help me out? I think I probably can, yeah. I'll drive it around the block. Would you do that for me? Shit, this door is always sticking, you don't mind, right? Well no, not at all, go ahead. I got it. I don't know anybody that likes that. Get me outta here. - Here we are. - Jesus. Wow, who lives here? My uncle. Really? You like it? Oh, it doesn't do much for me, honey. So you're a hard man to impress, right? - Come on. - Are we alone? Whoa. We're gonna go this way, cowboy, let's go. Come on. Oh my god. Where are you taking me? - All right, babe. - Where's my car? That has my three favorite things. What are they? Japanese lesbian period piece. Yeah, I can see it myself. Oh, you look good. You're goddamn right I do. We both look good. I'm a handsome son of a bitch. Whoa, stop shoving me. Oh. Oh lordy, I'm kinda dizzy. What the hell is this? Hey, Lou. Hmm? Wanna take a sauna with me? Well, sounds like a good idea. Well there's a bathroom in there. You wanna grab that and then meet me in here? Well there you never told me what happened to your fingers. Ah, you know, I was working on a car and the hood came down on my hand and busted up my fingers. Occupational hazard, you know, what can I say? You know in my imagination it's kind of fucking hot in here, like more than it needs to be. Well, it is a sauna. Plus my uncle had it fabricated to be extra hot. Really? He succeeded in that, yeah. Jesus God in heaven it's hot in here. What about that champagne? Let me get that for you. Yeah, you should do that. You wanna know something, Lou? What? This room reminds me an awful lot of your son Pete. Okay. My son Pete? Hey! Open up this fucking thing! Dale. Yeah, it's me. Help me. You betrayed the whole family, now you're gonna burn. We been waitin' 29 years! Now is my time. Let me the fuck outta here! You aint goin' nowhere. Where is that bitch? Just how long has it been since the brothers have seen each other? Let me the fuck outta here! Open this thing up. Where did you go? Hey, when he's done cookin' in there, take him back to his place so they can find the corpse. Let me outta this - fucking thing now! - Nice work, Rachael. - We'll see ya in a couple weeks. - Hey! Let me the fuck outta here. We'll see you back at the Sazarac. Hey! Open up this fucking thing! Hey, Pete. What's goin' on? Nothing. Your phone's ringin'. Yeah, yeah, I didn't even hear it. Uh, usually it stops. Yeah, it's probably your brother. He called the rangers station, but they told him that you were on leave. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I had to use some of my vacation days. Why are you wearing the uniform then? My other stuff's in the wash. Hey, man, listen, I've got some bad news. Let's have it. It's your dad. He passed. Is that all? I just wanna let you know how sorry... Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Aw, every fucking time! What? Jesus Christ, come on. Put some clothes on. Well then fucking call me first, man. Why, you wanna come in or what? What's up? It's Dad. What? Wait, wait, whoa, is he alive? What happened, sweetie? What are we gonna do? I got a letter from Uncle Reynolds. My dear Duffy, words cannot express my sorrow at this time. I understand you're having a memorial service for my brother. Unfortunately, obligation has me elsewhere. I could remember Lou telling me he wanted to be cremated. I don't know what your plans are for the remains, but may I suggest the ranch where we grew up? Down on that river we had some of the most profound and some of the stupidest conversations I've had in my entire life. If things had gone differently today, I just know that's where he'd be putting me. I want you to take the family house. I'll have the caretakers across the river open it up for you. I'll come down Friday night, and we can all have supper. The only problem your dad had with me, Duffy, was my sense of responsibility. I sure hope we can put it all behind us and try to be a family now. Your uncle, Reynolds. They give you the weekly rate here, Gus? She's got jokes. She using again? She's 32 days clean, but thank you for your concern. Cheers. You never did like my wife, did you? I never liked her and I never liked you neither. Sorry I can't place your name. Emma. You've met her like three times. A little young for you, isn't she, Gus? If they're any older than her I'm just not talking to 'em. How long has this been going on? Like a year, we met last winter. She fell off the ski gondola. He rescued me. God. I'm sure the whole starving artist thing seems appealing right now, but you really are slumming it over here. And you know what happens to nice girls like you when they slum it? They end up in slums. Thanks for the advice, granny. Um, speaking of grannies. Do not do it, Gus. I have the most heartwarming story for you guys. No one wants to hear that story, not in front of the kid. No, I'm intrigued. One night Duffy and I are out. We met these two GIs. We started hanging out with 'em and throwing 'em back. We end up back at the GI's grandma's house. A few hours go by and nobody can find Duffy anywhere. Finally, there's Duffy knee deep in these GI's grandma. He's going down on her, then with the analingus. We just sat back and watched. Good God, it was disgusting, right, Duff? Woo! Hey, stay out of there. Is it Christmas already? Sup, Petey? How you doin' man? What, did you get married or something? Oh no, it's something, just um. This is my friend, Emma. What is this? We have Dad's remains in the car, we're hoping you'd come along. We're bringing him down to the river. Sazarac? No thanks. I got to get some stuff going on this weekend. Besides, you haven't been down there? It's not exactly a Starbucks crowd. It's where he spent his youth. Can't you find a pond or something? Come on man, Dad had one wish. I'm out. I don't like crowds. It would only be the six of us. With me I count five. We have Louie in the car. You're calling him Louie? How old is he now? He's six. Let me see him. Hey, Louie! Louie, this is your Uncle Pete. I have a Uncle Pete? Mm hmm. Come on. Okay. Do you have enough room in your closet? What? He's been watching infomercials. Crowded closets mean wrinkled clothes. The Bend-A-Hanger can triple your closet space. It's strong enough for five winter coats. I'll look into that. I'm gonna ride with my Uncle Pete. Come on, let's go, Uncle Pete. I guess I'll follow you, then. How creepy is that fricken place? I sure hope your uncle's place is nicer. Yep, I'd call that nicer. What the hell have we been doing with our lives? I guess we've been slumming it. I'll take the guest house. Aw, come on man, that's no fun. Stay here with us. Seriously, why have we never been here before? They didn't speak for 30 years. I don't even know what happened. Maybe some reason Dad just never liked money. But it never felt right to reach out to Reynolds knowing how the old man felt. Go and find us the best room, okay. - Okay. - Okay. Hey, let's go get our room. What's with the rain water? What do you wash your hair with? I don't. You should wash your hair with rain water man. She taught me. It's like, it gives it this really great texture, just makes it feel natural. It looks natural. Where are you going, little guy? We're going to pick some apples. We're going over to the orchard before nightfall. Whatever, let's go. Um, you know what, it was a long drive, I just, I'm tired, I just kinda hang with Louie. Maybe get to know Pete a little bit? Unless Pete, do you wanna come? I like apples. Hey lady, you hungry? Do you think your boy could come play with us? Of course he can. Come on, Louie, go make some new friends. Hey man, you need some help? Nah, I've been climbing outta apple trees - since I was born. - Here, I got, give, give. - I'll give you a hand. - Get back, buddy. So which one of you boys is single? You don't got to have a big dick, but you got to have a job. You don't got to pay my bills, but you got to pay your own bills. So? So, so what? You got a job or what? Well, yeah, I mean, I'm a painter. Houses and such? Nah man, pictures. Pictures, huh? I don't mean to sound a little desperate here, but time is marching, I got two nieces and we don't have too many male suitors up around in these parts. You ever smile? Come on, I'll take you down to the Sazarac River. Beautiful women over here. Do you wanna come? Nah, I'm cool. Come on, meet my nieces, you boys are gonna love 'em. I'm gonna go unfold the loaf. I'll catch up with you guys. This is Allegra and Rachael. Do you want some pie? - Mom just made us some. - I wouldn't uh wanna impose, miss. Nonsense, you can call me Nano. Nano? Hey, buddy. Hey, Pa. He calls you Pa. Yes, ever since I showed him Old Yeller. I think you're the most adorable little thing I've ever seen. You're adorable. I remember when I was little and I got food poisoning and I threw up all over my bed and Nano came in and was like trying to clean up the whole thing with one tissue. That was a long time ago. Yeah, ages. You're so unappreciative. I am not. You need to give yourself completely, just like I have. What do I have left to give? Give him your baby. My nieces like you, I could tell. - Yeah? - Yeah. Why don't you bring the boy back tomorrow so he can come play with the other childrenses. Anyone seen Gus? Over there. I'm going to play in my room. I coulda sworn I shut that thing. Hey Pete, was that there when we left? Is it carved there? Well, that's Latin. I kneel before no one. How the fuck did you know that? It's on the line in the cross. It symbolizes like protection among children or something. That sounds kind of nice. Uh, I'm going to check the house. You know what? I don't like shit like that. All this shit creeps me out. Pete, is anybody up there? - No. - By the way, can everyone stop being such gigantic pussies? It's 2018 in America, there are no boogeymen out there. Just relax. Reynolds will be here soon. Start a fire, have a beer. Just chill, that's all you need, okay? Hope you guys are liking the house. Thank you for dinner, I'm glad we could make this happen. Yeah, always... You're so sweet. Laurel, what is in the, what's in the sippy cup? - Let me see this. - This is. This is Lilly's. - Let me see this sippy cup. - This is Lilly. - Where's Lilly? - Let me smell. Lilly's not at the dinner table. - Give me the sippy cup. - Is what's going on. Let me see, let me see. Okay,. Fuck, you stole these. It's fine. How'd you two meet? Yeah, how did you two meet? - Wow. - Oh. - Pete's invested, okay. - He wants to know. You don't want to hear this story, it's it's... Yeah, I wanna hear it. So, Gus invites me to this gallery opening one night in downtown. Oh, not this one. The artist is there with his young girlfriend who happened to be. Before we wed, my darling wife Laurel. So, we're there and Gus sees her and cornered her. When was this? It was like 10 years ago, baby, don't worry about it. Anyways, so the sculptor's walking around, he's talking to donors. Meanwhile, Gus is draped all over Laurel, I mean he's like trapped her in the corner, he's playing grabass, he's doing little secret games. The guy comes over and the guy's all pissed off and he's like, he's like hey, get away from my chick. Of course I didn't. Yeah, Gus starts mouthing off so the guy shoves him into the waiter that has a tray of champagne glasses. Oh, it breaks everywhere, I mean, it's all over my eyes. I can't see, but I felt it. I mean, he was none too pleased, but. Some more waiters had to come over. Yeah, meanwhile Duffy's just standing by watching this all take place. He turns and he steps up to the guy calmly. Duffy rips his own shirt to shreds and takes the guy, smashes him into his own installation, and then he stands up and he turns to the waters and says, wait what'd you say to them, Duff? Who wants a piece of this? In the middle of an art gallery? - Best line. - Best line. And that's when I knew I was gonna spend the rest of my earthly existence with this one. What in the fuck is that supposed to mean? You shoulda seen it, Petey. Yeah, Pete, I wish you were there. Yeah, me, too. Pete, are you okay? Why was he institutionalized? We don't really know. I mean, he's crazy as shit. Dad never told us anything and obviously you can see Pete's not much of a talker. By the time he got back he was just really never himself again. What do you mean he was never himself, he was a little kid when he went in. And I remember what he was like. What? Just a regular kid, man. Let's go to bed, baby. How's it going out here? Good. You never realize how loud it is in the city until you come out to a place like this. Yeah, that's why I stay out of the city. So, uh, where do you work? I work at Crater Lake. Three months off in autumn. It's nice. The national parks. Aren't they a thing to be amazed by? Yeah. You know, come to think of it, Pete. I could use a guy like you to take care of the property down here for me. You can come and go as you please and make up your own schedule. Why would you do that for me? Because you're family and I don't see in either of your brothers the kind of strength I see in you. Why do you spend time working for strangers when you can work your own land? Well it's not my land, it's yours. But it's not gonna be forever. What exactly would you need me to do? Who do you think would win a fight between Harry Potter and Peppa Pig? Harry Potter and Peppa Pig, huh? Um, I got to say Harry Potter. What do you think? Yeah, because he's been in wizarding school for like eight years, so that's an easy one. Yeah, I think you're right. He already beat Voldemort, Draco, the whole Slytherin gang. Like Tom Riddle? Tom Riddle, that's right, he already beat him. The baskalisk. And the basilisk. Louie, I can see the light, what are... Good night, little man. Goodnight, Uncle Pete. Get some sleep. What happened last night? What was that? I have this neurological condition that magnified sounds, I, I can't process noise like that. Just rattles my brain. Sorry if I freaked you out. No, no you didn't freak me out. That's why I like it here so much. I always like being out by water where it's quiet. When I'm here I really feel like I'm a part of its Earth. You got any place like this around your way? The downstairs bathroom. It's the only place I can work on my music. Gotta hide and lock myself down there. It's nice that you have something like that though. You know, I saw you play once. When was this? You were back in high school and Dad invited me to one of your concerts. You were pretty good, too. I remember when I was watching you it was like... Duffy, what are you doing out here? Come back to bed. What were you saying? - Oh, nothing. - Finish what you were saying. We'll talk about it later, duty calls. All right? See ya. I saw some books and stuff, you like reading? No. Here's a good one, let's grab this guy. All right. You ready, you ready? - Yeah. - Yeah. What is that? That's a strange thing to find out here. What is it? It's the chalice of the lord of earth. There was a pact made with mankind. Whoever drinks from it is granted a new life. It's like a Christian thing? No. Well, how do you know about this stuff? About the chalice of the lord of the earth? Well the chalice is a symbol. It's called the occult, Gus. And how do you know about all this stuff? It's super creepy that you do. Creepy? Maybe, but the occult is neither good or bad, it just means knowledge. Knowledge is hidden in symbols and symbols work. They're at work on you every day. - Wow. - They're not gonna work on me. How does it work if you don't believe in it, though? In the 1950s when Betty Crocker introduced instant cake mix, at first it wouldn't sell and they discovered that middle class mothers felt guilty about not making it from scratch. They added three simple words onto the box, add an egg. Add an egg? Add an egg. It's a symbol. It's the ancient sign of fertility. You see, the mother envisioned herself cracking the egg and she no longer felt guilty. They entered her mind and controlled her thought process subconsciously. An absolute perversion of her free will. And that's the occult. So what do you do up there, Petey? In the mountains? Cut out that racket, Rachael. Well, the other night I watched Miracle on 34th Street. And then what happened? I look forward to that one all year. You know I like when Natalie Wood gets the dream house. Well why do you wait all year? You know, they got stores for that now. You just walk in and they rent out the movie to you. - No, what? - What? What fucking decade are you living in? We don't have video stores anymore. You just rent the movie right there on demand. Push a button and presto. I don't think I have that type of television. Well, you watch the movie on TV, though, you got to watch all the commercials. I like to watch it when I know other people are watching, too. You know, the other night I had this dream and in the dream I'm watching the movie and I can see into everyone else's house who's watching, only I'm the only one who's tuned in. Why did, uh, Dad send you away? I never heard the full story. Emotional problems. Where'd he send you to? New Hampshire State Mental Institution. Oh, hey, that's where uh Kurt Vonnegut did all that research for Cat's Cradle. That's cool. Yeah, yeah, it was fantastic. Dad sent you two to art school and I got to go to the mental institution. Man, what'd you do in there? Arts and crafts mostly. Let's head out. I feel like taking a walk in the woods. Where's Gus? I think he's taking a steam. Hey, have you seen Pete? He said he was going for a walk. Hey, Louie! Come on, let's go. I'm going across the river. He's gonna play with the other childrenses. The what? Okay. What do you think you're doing? Come on, I don't have one in my room. It's no fair. Get out. Grow up, we're practically brother and sister. You're wearing your underwear. It's the same as a bathing suit. All right, get in. But no funny business. In the ancient times in the valley of the gnome, the first born children were forced to swim in the lake of fire. And so the land was polluted with blood. Then came Moloch, the benevolent. Merciful Moloch, he commanded the Canaanites relinquish control of the children. And so the children of Canaan were passed through the fire nevermore. Henceforth, they were consecrated to his high priest... Hey, what do you say, Duffy! What's going on, Dale? How did you sleep? Pretty good. Good, some stuff got tagged in the house. Oh, that's probably the meth heads down the street. Yeah, that's what my brother said. Yeah, they hit me before but I hit 'em back! You staying at the big rich house, right? Yeah, how'd you know that? Well, I saw your car parked out in front, it's like a one six, right? Yeah. Hey, Rachael, Rachael, come here a minute! And the parents who passed their children over to Moloch's priest would not be guilty. Future childbirths and a successful harvest awaited. That's a pretty cool hat you have there. It's a Dumbledore. This must be your very pleasant wife. I barely know this woman. Nice to meet you. Sorry, it's germy season and I don't like to shake hands. Right. Hey, um, they're listening to a pretty cool story over there if you wanna check it out. Have you seen the barn yet? No, I haven't, but I'd like to. You really should. We'll watch the boy. You two go get yourself acquainted. So what do you do with yourself? You mean like my day job? I'm a nanny. You're a nanny? Uh huh. What do you think? He said he thinks his new nanny is pretty. Oh. Mom! Well, why don't I give you guys a minute to get acquainted. Hey, can you go sit next to Rachael? Okay. Hey, listen to her, okay? Where's my Chinese takeout? Do you like being a nanny? I've always enjoyed looking after the children, but actually, I'm more of a singer. I'd like to hear you sing sometime. If you weren't married, like... - Lau... - That's not what this is about, I just wanted to spend time with you and. - It's not. - So you are married. My wife and her family, they insisted on it. So it's like a religious thing or? Only as it pertains to annoying other people. You know what I think? I think you just miss being young. You know, I'm young. I need to go to the bathroom. You can go over there. Just go in the woods. Where do you write your songs? Just over the mountains. It's my great grandfather's farm. There's this old broken down truck that I've been playing in since I was little. My mom played in it before me. We've been farming dairy there for like 100 years. Can we go there sometime? We'll see about that, mister. We should probably get back before we get caught. You go that way, and I'll go out that way. Which, do you wanna, by the tree in like 10 minutes? - Okay. - Okay. Go! Go! Louie! Hey, have you seen Louie? What, uh? No, I I thought he was with you. Where's Emma? Louie' gone. Look, put your shit on, come downstairs. Pete. Hey, is my boy in there, have you seen him? No, there's nobody in here. What, did you lose him or something? I left him with the people we were with yesterday. Well, I haven't seen him since last night. He's gone. Well, we'd better go find him then. Louie! He favors our work. Who's he? Hey, hey, hey, hey, turn it off! I didn't know it was gonna turn on, it's like 100 years old. Well, come on, man. Hey. - Pete, you okay? - You okay man? What the fuck? You see anything down there? Hey. Let's go check the barn. I already checked the barn. Yeah, like you checked the shed? Louie! Hey, Pete. How'd you know that compartment was down there? What? Oh, you don't know? I was, I was down there and I, I don't know, something just... You tell me right now! How did you know that? Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. No, show him this shit. That's just like the one in the compartment where Louie's hat was. What's going on in the fucking guest house? What're you trying to say, Duffy? You were reading him books. Nine times out of 10 they say it's a family member. Do you, do you hear this shit? I see how you fucking act with him. You're doing all this fucking Luciferian bullshit. Look it, I'm starting to get a little angry. All right, if you two assholes wanna stay here and waste time, that's fine. I'm going to look for Louie, all right? Go look for him then, you motherfucker. You're part of my fucking family! You think I took your boy? Huh, is that who you think I am, kid? You think I would harm him, too? I don't have to, Pete, do you understand me? Did you know that the Exerciser provides a complete cardiovascular workout in the privacy of your home in less than three minutes? If you don't stop talking, I'm gonna put you back in the-the-the-the dark hole again. I know a kid at school who talks like you do. He talks funny. I told you to stop talking. So what happened to you, Pete? Why did Dad take you away like that? I don't know. He never said anything about the hospital. I went away when I was six and I was so drugged out on scripts that I don't remember anything before I joined the Corps. You don't come back from where I was. I don't know why Dad sent me away, and after I came back I just couldn't be around here anymore. I don't know what I did, and I don't know what happened to me, but, I haven't been able to think about anything else since. And that's all I got. That's all I got. That's it. That's it. I'm sorry, Pete. No, that's all right. - No listen, I'm sorry, man. - It's okay. - I was your brother. - It's okay, man. I was your brother, I should've been - there for you. - But it's not your fault, Gus - I should've been there. - It's not your fault, man. I should've been there for you. Look, look, look, look at me. Hey, hey! I'm sorry. There. We got to go check that out. No, no, I think we should split up, we're running out of time. Yeah, let's split then. Duffy, go find out where that smoke's coming from, I'm gonna go down by the river and I'm gonna look near the canoes, okay? Why can't I look at the canoes? 'Cause maybe I don't wanna climb up that fucking mountain. I'm gonna go check back at the house. Why do you keep on putting me in all these dark places? Because that's where the children go. That's just the way it is. I want my daddy to come get me right now! Hey! Wait! Stop! Sit down. Louie! Where is my boy? I don't know. I don't know shit. This is my son's iPad. Your boy was took? My son, Vernon Junior. He got took when we was out fishing in the creek in 1976. You see, it's the river that takes the boys. When them creeks rise, they done washed out all the wood down along the banks. And not just the deadwood, do you understand? Them trees are alive when the creek gets to it. But when that pull comes, that pull of the dark momentum, it done washes them all the way out to the sea. Is that the last time you saw him? Oh, he comes back. That Vernon stopped being our boy a long time ago. Whatever that boy had inside, they just done ripped it right out of him. How old was your boy when they took him? Six. They always take 'em when they're six years old. Come quickly now. Call me Nano. You better hurry before they come back. What's the matter, big guy? I have nothing to play with. If you could have anything, what would it be? Well, what are you gonna ask for from Santa this year? Reindeer antlers. I know someone just like Santa Claus. You do? Yeah, except that he knows what you want before you even ask. You know how you always believe in Santa? How Santa always comes through for you? That's exactly like the one I'm telling you about to do for you. You have to trust him. Whatever happens later, just hold those antlers tight, okay? Okay. All right. You do realize this is my brother's grandson? Dog food is what we've been giving all the kids. Have you forgotten what I taught you? When a child does good he should be rewarded. Just how I used to reward you. Did I reward you? You you, you you. It's all right. Did I reward you? You can make your signs. Hey. Detective Doherty. We found the boy. You, you found him. We found him. Louie? Where did you find him? These logging roads, it's crazy. You know, you make a wrong turn and the kid got lost. Which one? Like uh, you know, up, up River Road there. Right off it. Where is he now? We got him up the way, he's waiting for you to come on up. It's the damnedest thing. Hey, what's going on? They found him, Duffy. They found him? I'm sorry. He's gone. He's what? He's gone. Don't listen to a word he's saying. Every word from his mouth is a sadistic lie. He is holding your boy captive, and he is the one that killed your father! Make sure Nano stays in the barn from now on. I'll take care of it. All right. Louie? Louie! Emma, hey. What the fuck is this? It was supposed to be a baptism. It was a sacrifice. One baptism. One sacrifice. Where am I? Your great grandfather's farm. This is where it all began. I must've spent 5,000 hours in this room. Your dad, too. It's hard work, dairy farming. But it prepares you for what's ahead. And what is ahead exactly? I'm genuinely sorry for what I did to your father, but we are the children of Moloch. And he lacked the constitution to be part of the family business. It's Moloch's sacred decree that the child be delivered in his sixth year in his sixth month and the sixth day of his life. Isn't that tomorrow? We could always have you spawn with Rachael. Or Laurel's young enough to have another kid. Two kids. You just got to let this kid go. See you around six. Some of my trees are 3,000 years old. You know how they feed? Their arteries run below the surface 100 feet in all directions. You can't see them, but their veins are there swallowing life. So it is the way we come at you. We're in your house at every hour, watching everything you ever say or do. Tonight you will witness the dark passage. Behold the five sides of your shield and consider this this oath that we give to you, crowned prince. One baptism. One sacrifice. We summon tonight the great Leviathan within this child and we offer to you his soul in veneration on this, the 52nd year of Satan. - May the fires of hell. - May the fires of hell - burn inside him. - Burn inside him - and give him strength. - And give him strength. Tonight, little boy, we will leave this place and go to the capital, where for the rest of your formative years you will indulge in every fleshly pleasure known to man. Laurel. Laurel. How does she know your name? We're sisters. Don't you see, Duffy? They're all my sisters. - Hi, Uncle Reynolds. - Hi, Uncle Reynolds. Nieces. Hey, it's okay. Mommy's here. That nice man is gonna take you on a trip with him. But I don't wanna go on a trip with him. But he's the high priest. There'll be lots of other boys there to play with. Special boys, just like you. Now, turn to this vantage and from the dark lord's chalice. Very good. And now breathe. Because when we enter this life, we inhale, and when we exit this life, we exhale. Now, take your final breath in this room as you drink from the true grail. Good. Get away from me, you fat piece of shit. Duffy, no. Let him do it. This is his commencement. Well yes, that's true. No, you're doing it wrong. Don't interrupt me. He's right and you know it. Pete. Pete! For the love of whatever you believe in. Get that snake away from Louie right now. Pete. Pete! Pete, no! Stay down! You mother fucker! Louie, Louie, go run and hide! Where do you think you're going? - Get over here! - Let me go! Uncle Pete, help me! The boy was never meant for you, he was meant to be an atonement. Watch out! That's for Gus! - Yes, open your both. - Let the boy go. Uncle Pete, help me! You keep coming, I'll kill ya. You killed me a long time ago. I love redheads. Brush this off, okay? Don't worry, let's go. Pete, you okay? Don't worry, Uncle Pete's gonna be okay. It's okay. Stop, you're good, you're good, don't worry, don't worry. Come on. Help me get him up. Pete, you're good, right? Good. What did you say to that guy? What? What did you say to that guy at the bar that time? I said who wants a piece of this? Oh, Pete. A couple of girls ran off. I'll take you to the other kids. Hey, what happened to you, man? Hey, is this your ball? Yeah. Hey, hey stop! Who in the fuck? Wait, just. What are. What do you want here? Who are you? You want a piggyback ride? Up. If that's where we put Uncle Gus, then where are we gonna put Uncle Pete? I got a pretty good idea where we're gonna put Uncle Pete.
