(phone ringing) (typewriter typing) - [Supervisor] Yes, mam - [Customer] I want to pay the top one. - [Supervisor] Oh, the $17 figure? - Mm hmm - Uh huh, will that be cash? - I'm here to see the supervisor. - I'm the supervisor, I'll be with you in a moment. Will that be cash, mam. - Yes. - A woman supervisor. - There's your receipt mam, Thank you so much. - Thank you. - Now sir, can I help you? - Yeah, my phone's off. - What, sir? - My phone's off! It don't work. - Oh, I'm sorry sir, we can have a repair crew out there to take care of that problem immediately. - Here, this here thing here says non payment of bill, now that's not true I have been paying my bill regular. - Well, yes you have Mr. Purdy except for this .89 cents county tax. - Yeah - Now you've not paid that for three years. - I voted against that tax. - Oh, but that tax was voted in, you still got to pay it same as everybody else. - Do you know that they're gonna use that tax to widen the county road? - Well, I don't see what that has to do with the tax. - What's wrong with the road that we have now? - I still don't see what that has to do with it. - They're gonna bring more trucks, they're gonna bring in more cars, and more pollution. They're gonna build more houses, more people are gonna move in. They're gonna tear down the trees, and destroy the entire country. - [Supervisor] Mr. Purdy - They're going to destroy the world. - Mr. Purdy, what does that have to do with your phone bill, you still have to pay it or we can't continue your service. - That's not right and I'm not paying. - See what happens here, you vote against their taxes and they take away your phone. It's against freedom of speech. Try talking logic to a woman, huh? - [Jeb] Hey Flagg, how are ya? - Jeb, Sandy. - [Sandy] When you coming back to work Flagg? - When they get them a foreman that don't cut corners. - That'll be a cold day in July. - Whatcha gonna do? - I got me some plans. - Say, can I give you a lift home? - My legs will carry me just fine. - Okay, so long, Merry Christmas to ya. - Yeah. - [Jeb] Same old Flagg. (lively banjo music) ("Silent Night") (child screams) - Fonz ate the fink, Dink the fink. - Franklin Roosevelt Purdy, you get over here this minute! - Dink the fink, Dink the fink - Dink the fink. Dink the fink. (children yelling) - Ahh! I can't take any more of this. (crying) (organ music) (whistling) (baby gurgling) - You gonna wear that locket out. Ellie, look here what come today. Reach in under there. This card come from Lula Mae, she sent a picture. - Little Sara's getting so big. When I get married papa's gonna cut me off from the family too. - Well, he did what he thought was right. When you gonna tell him? - Just waiting for the right time. - Ain't no such thing. - Al wants the wedding right after Christmas. - Maybe I should tell him. Maybe he'd take it easier from me? - [Flagg] Ada, honey, I'll take me a sugar cookie and a cup of coffee. - Here you go running again. - Well after so many years it's hard to change. - Mama you promised me and Lula Mae that you'd try. I'm gonna tell him about the wedding right now. (baby crying) (organ music) Papa - No don't put that for me, get that out first, no thanks. - Papa - Sit down dear. - Papa I really think - * I was standing by my window yester morning * - Lou Ellen can I see the picture in your locket? - Mind your own business Billy Joel. - * When I saw the postman coming down the pathway * - [Young Boy] What's the capital of West Virginia? - I don't recognize West Virginia. - But the book says - I don't care what the book says, there's only one Virginia and Richmond is its capital. * With such a happy smile and jaunty air * - Can I put more wood in the stove? - No stoking thins the blood. * Oh, he rang the bell and whistled while he waited * - How do you spell myrrh ? - What? - [Billy Joel] Myrrh - There no such word. - It's in the Christmas play. - Gold, frankincense, and myrrh. - There no such word, and if there is I don't want you crowding up your head with it, ya hear? * And then he said good morning, to you Jack * - M-Y-R-R-H - Tomorrow when you see Miss Keyes, you tell her what I said about such words, ya hear? - Miss Keyes quit. - * but he little Why? - She said same as the last one, too many Purdys. - Well something must of driv her to it. - She was taking a ruler to Franklin Roosevelt, and Edgar threw a black board eraser at her. - I did no such thing. - You did too. - [Young Girl] You did too. - [Young Boy] You did too. - Well, it slipped out of my hand. - How come her to take the ruler to ya. - We were practicing the Christmas play and Franklin Roosevelt got one of the wise men bit by a turtle. - It was only Dink Kibler. - Dink's the wise man with the, myrrh. - Aren't you supposed to be helping out Miss Keyes? - [Lou Ellen] I was playing the piano. - Well tomorrow when I get time for it I'm gonna take my belt to Edgar and Franklin Roosevelt, but Miss Keyes should have stuck by her job no matter what. - The eraser hit her right hard. - I don't care, principle is at stake here. Miss Keyes quit, that makes three this year. - Last year it was five. (baby gurgling) - Ada, get your coat. - What for? - Go down to Waller's, phone Miss Keyes, and tell her I'm gonna give her another chance. - Well the Waller's won't let us use the phone. Not since you vote against his brother. - Well then go to the Upton's. - We ain't spoke to since last August. - Well then, I guess I'm just going to have to let Miss Keyes go. I'll go to the schoolhouse first thing in the morning, make sure the new teacher gets started off right. I will go directly after I take Franklin and Edgar to the woodshed. - What'd Franklin and Edgar do? - I forget. - Was up to Molly's today, she and Ben's coming over this week. - Yeah, she leading him over by the nose? - She's bringing me a winter coat. - [Flagg] Hmm, now he's so rich he can give away coats, huh? - Thought I might cut it down for Lou Ellen. - What for? - She's got herself a young man. - Nooo, she's too young we can't let her go, we just had one to get married last winter. - She's of an age - You tell her, that I said, when it's a fit time for her to get married I will let her know. - And Molly's got herself all new furniture, Ben's got Molly a electric blanket. - I've been warming your side of the bed Ada, honey. - Molly says it hottens up the whole bed. - Yeah, did she tell you about the man in town got electrocuted last week using one of those things? - No it's funny I didn't see nothing in the paper about no electrocution. - Papers, you don't expect to see nothing in the papers about it, not when the electric company owns all the papers. Heck, they in cahoots, they probably own the phone company too, well I gave them their last chance I'm not gonna deal with them anymore. Telephone's just keep people from talking eye to eye anyway. Makes em nervous, that's the trouble now and days everybody's in a big hurry. - Molly says Ben's got more work than he can handle. Needs a working partner. - Well I ain't working for him if that's what you're driving at. - [Ada] Much as we need the money. - Ben is a man of no principle, plus he thinks small. Heck, I know things have been a little rough lately, Ada honey, but I've needed this time alone for thinking and planning. Don't you worry none, I'm working on it. Things are cooking in my brain. Good times are coming, Ada. * yes sir, good times are coming * Ada, Ada you forgot something. - Hmm? - My glass of water. - Couldn't you manage without it tonight? It's so cold. - But I might wake up thirsty. - [Ada] Well you never do. - But I might. Ada honey, half a glass will do. I'm not done with my breakfast yet they're gonna have to wait. - They'll be late for the bus, come on. - Wood box is empty. - Fill it. - Ain't up to me to fill it. - Well have one of the boys do it then. - They got school to go to. - Well when they come home! - I was just thinking about your dinner. I won't have a stick of firewood. - This ain't one of ourn - That's cousin Laura's youngest, she's expecting. - You tell him to keep himself quiet around here. - He's a good little fella. - There's something else. A Christmas tree. - If the good lord wanted trees in the house he would've planted them there. - [Ada] But the children want it. - It's contrary to the laws of nature, and you can tell them I said so. - Kids get your coats on and you'll need your boots. Orville Wright, don't forget your hat. - Mama, do you really think we can have a Christmas tree? - Hush, child. (lively banjo music) - Can't take no passengers Flagg, sorry. - Don't start with me Otey Hartsook, I've know ya since you fell off the turnip truck. - Only kids it's the law. - Yeah well the law don't intend for you to ride and me to walk. - New teacher, aye Flagg? - Yep, just here to see she gets of on the right foot. (laughs) What's so funny about a man taking interest in his kids education Otey? - Not a thing Flagg, yous a regular community service, you is. - I'd like to welcome you to a new school, my name's Flagg Purdy. Most of these kids here are mine. I'd like to say a few things before we get started, if you're planning on leaving, best do it right now because nobody likes a quitter. Is that clear? Good, I'm glad we understand each other. - Watch your step. - Yeah. (laughing) - Kids ain't got no manners. - Are you hurt? - No, no, look at this and I gotta go see the new teacher. - [Al] I'm the new teacher. - Oh yeah, but always before its been lady teachers. - [Al] They figured it was a man's job, I'm Al Harlan, is there anything I can do for you Mr. Purdy? - Oh you know my name, huh? - Of course, I can see the resemblance to Lou Ellen. - Oh yeah, how come you know Lou Ellen ? - We're getting married next week. - You - I wish we had time to talk things over Mr. Purdy, but I'm afraid I gotta go in now, perhaps we can talk later. - We've got nothing to talk about. You ain't marrying my daughter! (door slams) - Well how was your talk with the new teacher? - Where's Lou Ellen? - Doing the shopping. - How come you didn't bother to tell me it's some boy teacher she's planning on marrying. - Would it matter who it was? - She could've picked a man, not some upstart boy doing a woman's work. I thought she was the one in the family with some sense. Didn't you tell her what I said about getting married? - She's of no mind to change. - Well I guess I'm just gonna have to wallop it out of her then. Ada! Where's the new couch? - They come and took it. - They what? - They're no different than the phone company, or the gas company, or the electric company Flagg. They expect to be paid. - Don't they have no sympathy for a man down on his luck? I gave em my word I was gonna pay em first chance I get, but that dang bookkeeper just keeps sending them bills. - Weren't the bookkeeper that come and took the couch Flagg. - I need me some peace and quiet Ada, I got to get me some planning done. Where's my dinner at? - Your move mama. - No firewood. - Well get some. - From now on mama's not toting anymore wood. - You carrying another little surprise for me, Ada? - It ain't what you think Flagg. I could maybe bring in just - No! - It's time for dinner and I don't see my dinner on my table. - Like she says Flagg, we're gonna divide up the work around here so's when Lou Ellen goes - She ain't going no wheres. - I'm getting married, and before I leave I'm gonna see mama shed of the heavy work. - I expect to see my dinner on this table in half an hour. - Now what do we do? - We'll trade, you take the reds this time, maybe it will change your luck. - Ada honey, I don't mind fetching and carrying when you're feeling poorly. - [Lou Ellen] She ain't sick. - Don't be contrary. - Come to think of it I do have a little headache sorta. - I know'd it, I know'd it. - After dinner mama's gonna lay down and rest for a little while, you can tend to the children. - And where do you think you're going? - I'm going down to the schoolhouse. Mama should lay down for at least an hour. - You stay right down here girl, it's time you and I had us a talk. - Get him to clear us a path. - How'd she come to meet such a boy as that? - Met him at a school aids meeting. He's a fine man, he'll take good care of her. - She's getting too bold. I'm gonna have to lock her up for a while. - That's one kinda lock they ain't invented yet. Snow shovel's leaning upside the porch. - What's this here? Hey, what's this here? What's that? Finger! Daddy's finger. - Papa, when's Aunt Molly and Uncle Ben coming? - Tomorrow. - Good! - My mama says that Santa Claus is gonna visit my house the day after tomorrow, and leave me some presents. - Where is mama? - Taking advantage of my sweet nature. - Papa can I have some milk? - Sure angel. Alright, okay, stay there. Come on. So much fuss and bother over minding a few youngins. - [Little Girl] Papa I want a cracker too. - In a minute sweetheart, in a minute. - I want it now! - In a minute, one minute. Hey, what's going on? - We was just playing catch ( baby crying) - I'm gonna tan your hide. Look at this now. - But, you promised I want my cracker. - Okay, all right, I heard you the first time. (baby crying) Now what - [Little Girl] Papa, you promised, I want a cracker. - Shhh, hold it down, hold it down. Shh, Shh - [Little Girl] You promised, I want my cracker. - Ada! - [Little Girl] I want my cracker - Ada, you better come down here and change this here baby. Ada! - I'm asleep. - [Flagg] Well you better wake up pretty soon because I've had about enough of this here women's work. A man can't hardly get any planning done with all this racket going on! Ada! Ada! - Orville Wright, where's your hat? Eleanor there's some missing. - Oh well, they got kept in. - What for? - Teacher wanted to talk to em. - Well I don't like that at all, not at all. - Nice path papa. - [Flagg] * Just before the battle, mother * - Papa why don't we have electricity? - [Flagg] Electric lights strain the eyes Billy Joel. * While upon the field we're watching * - Who's that? - Lula Mae, my sister. - [Flagg] You ain't got no sister Lula Mae. - [Cousin's Son] At our house we got a big Christmas tree. - Shh - Shh - Mama puts colored paper on it. - Shh - [Eleanor] Shh - We don't follow the heathen habits of our kin. The Purdy's have their own way of doing things. That's what makes us special. Eleanor tell your mother I'm ready for my dinner now. - Yes papa. - Mama do you think we can have something special this year for Christmas dinner? - Papa says he's ready to eat mama - [Ada] Thank you, Eleanor. - Mind if we eat standing up mama? - Teacher give you a little extra help today? - He's a good teacher mama. - I'll have my supper now Ada. Well you're late, what happened. - Teacher was giving us some special help with our lessons. - Dang it! No teacher is gonna discipline my children for me. Make em late for supper. Ada, I'm taking these children out of school. - You can't, there's a law. - I will , we'll put them in the town school then. - There's no bus to town. - Then I will see the superintendent and I will tell him he's gotta start running one. The Purdy special, right boys? - Yes, papa. - [Edgar] Yes, papa. (banging) - Ada, I'll have me my supper now. - [Al] You'd look beautiful in that lace. We could take the honeymoon money and buy it. - I like mama's wedding dress just fine. - Has she finished altering it? - No she doesn't get too much time to work on it with papa home so much. - It's hard on a man's pride being out of work. - No, not papa his pride is much more important than working. - Hey, things will be better after we're married. - No they won't, he's gonna cut me off from the family just like he did Lula Mae. - I thought he cut her off because she eloped. - No, he cut her off because he didn't like the boy, same as you. - I should've broke it to him easier. I was trying to take him by surprise. - It wouldn't matter how you broke it to him. He'd still think you're stealing his little girl. - You'd think he'd get into the spirit of giving around Christmas. - You don't understand my papa. His family thought celebrating was sinful. He's totally against Christmas. - Honey, nobody's against Christmas. - He's never even let us have a Christmas tree. - That guy sounds like a regular scrooge. - The kids don't even know what it's like. - Your father doesn't know what it's like either. - Oh, mama wait til you see, you won't believe. - Mama, mama come and look. - Mama, come on. - Not just yet honey. - Mama, come on. - [Edgar] It's ready Mama. - Mama - It's like a calender picture. - Mama look there's even a star. (laughter) - Edgar - Can we open our presents now, Ellie? - No, tomorrow night sweetheart. (laughing) - Now the children got something to remember and pass on when they get youngins of their own. - They oughten to get old before they've had a chance to be children. That's what happened to me, I was always older than really. - Mama they got a surprise for ya. - That's real nice. This is my present. - It's Aunt Molly and Uncle Ben. - [Children] Hi Aunt Molly - Hello children, Ben will you hurry up. Don't drop that basket of food the pie will squash. - Man weren't meant to be no mule. (excited chatter) - I don't know how you put up with all this. Oh my gracious! Where'd that come from? - [Ada] Lou Ellen and Al bought it. - Where's flagg? - Setting the school superintendent straight. - Good, maybe we'll miss him all together. (laughs) - Molly pour us out some of that punch and let's celebrate. ("Deck the Halls") (door slams) (baby gurgling) - Well, if it isn't jolly old St. Nicholas. - How are you Flagg? - Celebrating lazy's the mind, go to bed. Mind your pa, get! (groaning) - Don't you just love Christmas spirit? - Molly, Flagg's just upset because we were celebrating without him, that right? - Huh - Who brought that tree in here? - Lou Ellen and Al spent every penny of their honeymoon money on it, and the presents. It's the nicest thing anybody ever done for us. - Are you gonna take that tree out of here or do I have to throw it out behind you? - Well, of all the rude inconsiderate - We better go. - Pa never allowed no Christmas tree in his house, and I never allowed no Christmas tree in my house, and I don't intend to start now! - Night Flagg. - Merry Christmas, everybody. - Lou Ellen and I bought that tree for the children. - [Flagg] If my children are gonna have goodies for Christmas I will be the one to buy them. - Mr. Purdy - [Ada] You never did! - This is my house and I will not stand for no tree! - Flagg Purdy this is our house! And if you touch so much as a needle on that tree, I'll leave ya, I'll take the children and leave ya. - Goodnight Mrs. Purdy, Mr. Purdy. - Are you satisfied now that you've ruined everybody's Christmas? - You're the one that's ruined things, and I will not have it! - This is my house, and those in it will do what I say. There's a principle involved here. - The only principle involved is your pigheadedness. - I will lock you up before I see you go to a boy like that! Ada my water ain't here. - [Ada] I must've forgot. - [Flagg] I've never had such a powerful thirst in my life. - [Ada] you'd best go to the pump then. - [Flagg] It weren't me that forgot the water. I don't think it's proper for me to have to get up and get the water that you forgot to put on the table. - [Ada] It ain't me that's thirsty Flagg. - [Flagg] But it's your job. Ada, Ada! (water pouring) (paper rustling) Ada? (banging on the door) Ada, are you in there? Ada? (paper ripping) (loud crying) - I used to cry every New Year's when papa took the tree down, all us children did. (snoring) - [Flagg] Ada! (knocking on door) Ada! Open the door Ada! Ada! Ada, open this door you hear me? Ada. - Come on now have your breakfast. - I will not stand for this disrespectfullness, you hear me? Ada! Ada, open this damn door. Ada! Ada! Open this door. I will not take responsibility for what happens if you don't open this dang door. - I'm going up to Uncle Ben's, get your clothes for the pageant. - [Flagg] Ada! Ada! - Hurry up now, careful. - Ellie I'm scared. - I know you're scared. - Soon as we get by the road you unlock the bedroom door. - I'll just leave now. - Turn the key and run, run hard. (baby crying) - Ada! Ada! I told you I wouldn't have no tree in my house and I meant it, I'm a man of my word. Purdy's always keep their word! I warned her, yes sir, I surely did. - I left him I took the children and left him. - Awe honey, I'm sorry. Come on kids, inside. - Hi, Uncle Ben. - [Ben] Hi, there. (lively banjo music) - [Al] Mr. Purdy - First you take over my school, discipline my own children. Then you plot with my daughter behind my back so she don't listen to me no more. - [Al] Mr. Purdy, Lou Ellen is old enough to know her own mind - [Flagg] Then you drag that heathen tree into my house, turn my children against me. And now my Ada's up and left me. - What? - [Flagg] You done set out to destroy my family and you done it boy. - Calm down, Mr. Purdy where did they go? - The mistake I made was not murdering you right off. - Fighting won't prove a thing Mr. Purdy. - You ain't got no principles, I'm glad I smashed that dang tree. - You destroyed the tree. - Yes sir, and I'm gonna do the same to the one that brung it. (radio program) - Problem now is where can we go? Everything's going by so fast I can't think. - Ben and I will help you find a place. We got a little money put back. - Molly I don't know how'll I'll ever repay you. You're a good friend to me. - Seeing you free of that man is payment enough. Mean, cranky, stubborn. - He's all that, all that and more. Most people get wore down, but not Flagg. That's his trouble, he won't wear smooth. - When we was first married, Ben had a streak of that same Purdy gussyness, I got it out of him quick. Now he's gentle as a kitten. - I suppose it all depends on what you want, kitten or a man. - There's still no answer. - You stick to the phone I'll get in the pickup and go scout around. - Now don't you worry honey, he's gonna turn up soon. Everything will be just fine. (grunting) (grunting) - [Molly] Hello, you just give me that coat and you go right in there. - Al, I've been looking all over for you, I was worried sick. - I'm sorry it couldn't be helped. - Where's Ben going? - He said to tell you he had one more stop to make. - That man, now he knows it's dinner time. You just sit down there and take his place. - That's very kind of you, Mrs. Purdy. - What happened to your hands? - Oh that, just scratched. - Meet up with Flagg? - We had a little talk. - Where's he at? - Question is how long is he gonna stay there? - He went home. - I never saw a man so bent on a fight. - Is papa all right mama? - I promise you he's all right, he's a tough man Mrs. Purdy, he'll be okay. I think it was just something he had to get out of his system. - You done the right thing mama. - I hope so, I surely do. (grunting) (organ) (grunting) (knocking on door) - It's open. - Hello Flagg. - Ben - You sure took care of that tree. - Now you know as well as I do, that a mans word is law in his own house. There is a principle involved. - Principle involved. Principles don't always put a man in the right Flagg. - No, well at least I stand up for what I believe in, not like some. - Flagg, you get more like pa everyday, you know that? Stubborn, self righteous. - Come all the way over here to sweet talk me big brother? - I come over to tell you that Ada and the children's at our place. - Yeah well, I figured as much. - Come back with me Flagg, tell Ada you're sorry. - Why should I apologize, she's the one who run out. Locked me up. - You give her no cause? You can act like you don't care little brother but I know different. - Where'd you get so high and mighty coming over here telling everybody what to do? You can't even open your mouth without Molly's say so. - Hush up Flagg. When you love somebody you got to learn to respect their feelings. But you ain't learned that yet. You're so busy trying to make everybody in the world live up to your principles. Well they won't, and you're gonna get old and lonely trying. - Ben! I shouldn't have said what I did, I'm sorry. - Yeah, I best be getting home. You, you do what you have to. - Ben, it don't come easy, asking for help, but I'm asking. ("Silent Night") (applause) (people talking) (baby crying) Hello Ada. - Hello Flagg. Are you okay? - Yeah I had a little accident, that's all. Got em a tree, bigger than the other one. Fixed up with fancies from town, Ada. - [Ada] Where'd you get the money? - Don't you worry, Ada I took care of it. - Out of my sugar bowl? - No, no, no, no, no. I worked out a deal with Ben, I'm taking him on as a working partner. - Huh, your taking him on. - Well we're working together, ask him he'll tell ya. Come on kids, look what your pa got. - [Eleanor] Papa - [Young Boy] Hi Papa - Go take a look Take a look Lou Ellen, you're welcome too Al. - Mr. Purdy, I would like to officially invite you to the wedding. - Oh - [Al] Next Sunday. - Will you come papa? - I'll be there. - [Lou Ellen] Lula Mae's coming. - Good, I was hoping she would. Will you come home now Ada? - I ain't got no home, me nor the children. - I will try to make it a home for ya Ada. I'll bring in firewood, and other things. - [Ada] Just what other things was you thinking of? - Well Ada honey, I know times are changing I'm willing to do most anything. Except of course woman's work. - Just what do you reckon woman's work to be Flagg Purdy? - Well you know what I'm trying to say. - [Ada] Well I know what you're trying to say, but you ain't said it. - I'm trying to say that I love you Ada, and I need you to come home. - I'll come back Flagg. But you best remember I've been my own woman for a day now, and I like the feel of it just fine. - Well I understand that Ada, but you got to remember that a man is the head of his family. It says so in the bible, I mean there's a prince there's a p, oh. - [Eleanor] Come on papa. - I'd never put up with it not for a minute, Flagg and his big talk. If it was me I'd have more pride. - Pride's a empty thing to have Molly, he talks big because he thinks big. Man that's got as many principles as Flagg, some of em bound to be wrong. Merry Christmas Molly, Ben. - [Ben] Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas Ada. (harmonica music) (excited talking)
