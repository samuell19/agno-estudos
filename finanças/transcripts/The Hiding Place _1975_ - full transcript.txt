Can hardship or calamity can persecution or abuse if we are hungry or poor or in danger? or threatened with death, does that mean that God has deserted us..No? Despite all this We have overwhelming victory through Christ who loves us For I am convinced that neither death nor life nor the powers of heaven nor the powers of hell itself can keep God's love from us Nothing in the world as it is Or the worlds, that it shall be in the forces of the Universe in all creation will ever be able to seperate us Along the side door Come on All Upstairs!
