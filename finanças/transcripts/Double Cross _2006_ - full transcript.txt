She asked if I regretted anything yet. All right, we're going to call the detectives. Talk to them. They'll help us nail her. No, no, no. How can we prove she was here? We can't prove anything. It's circumstantial, but there's a lot of it. We can make a case. Kathy >> Look, she'll hire the best lawyers. She'll... I need some time to figure this out. Apparently the police ha talking to all the neighbours. They must think I had something to do with Dean's death. Yeah, well, come on. You're the most viable suspect. You've got a possible motive and you were the last person to see the victim. All they're missing is the murder weapon. They've probably interviewed I wonder what she told them. She'd be hanging herself if she said anything, right? Yeah. Kathy >> What? Suzanne >> There's something I should tell you. She's been unstable and on meds for years. Why didn't you tell me this earlier, Suze? I couldn't. She told me in confidence. But insane or not, we can't let her get away with murder. The police are just going to have to believe you. And if they don't, I go to prison for the rest of my life for a crime that I didn't even commit. They... they have a motive. They have my voice on tape planning my husband's death.

How're you holding up? I just keep thinking about Dean and uh... what she's done to our lives. I know. Well, I've been doing some digging. Her mother was divorced when Sheryl was very young. Then things went from bad to worse, for... her mother hooked up with a creep who beat both of them. I think Sheryl blamed her father for what happened to her. Hence, her vendetta against men. Kathy >> Yeah? Sorry to interrupt, but there's a courier package that's that's just arrived for you. It's marked Urgent. Thanks. Suzanne >> It's got to be Sheryl. Kathy's voice on tape >> Now let's see, how shall we kill our husbands? ♪ Kathy >> I'm not going to let her get away with this. Please. Let me talk to the D.A. They can set up a sting. We can trap her at her own game. No, I mean, who knows what else she might have up her sleeve? I can't take that risk. Suzanne >> Well, I don't like you being alone. Kathy >> Thanks. Look, don't worry, okay? She needs me alive. At least for now. Yeah. Miller >> Mrs. Swanson, it's Detective Miller. I have a few questions. Can you come by the station, please. Uh... sure, I can come by the station in about 30 minutes. Miller >> Great. I'll see you then. The detective wants to meet with me. They say what they wanted? Yes, she has some questions. Suzanne >> Okay, it's about time you were represented. I'm go I'm going to go to the station with you. No, no, no. If I retain you as my lawyer now, they're going to think that I'm trying to hide something or, worse yet, that I murdered Dean. Kath... You need legal counsel. Anything you say can and will be used against you. You need me there, honey. I can't. Let me just call you later and let you know how it went, okay? It's fine. ♪ Miller >> I know this must be difficult for you, Mrs. Swanson. Thank you for coming in. Sure. Did you husband have an insurance policy? Uh... yes. We both did, for one million Why? Is there a problem? No. It's a routine question. When a husband or wife is a victim, we always look to the spouse as a possible suspect. That's horrible. Yes, but often true. I... I didn't kill my husband, detective. Well, if that's the case, you will have no problem submitting to a polygraph test. I thought polygraphs were inadmissible as evidence. Yes, that's true. But the police like to use them as a tool. Should I be hiring a lawyer, detective? That's entirely up to you, Mrs. Swanson. We consider everyone a suspect until proven otherwise. Well, I think that's it for now. Thank you for coming in. Sure. ♪ Um... Have you any other leads yet? Detective >> No. Not at this time. But we are confident that we'll break this case. Kathy >> I...

Miller >> Could you tell the make of the car? Only that it was a sedan. And it was black, I think. It seems really coincidental that not long after your husband was murdered, that your lawyer is mysteriously run down. Is there something you not telling us? No. Impeding an investigation is considered a crime in itsel Kathy >> I'm sorry, detectives. I don't know what to say. I don't know anything. What was she coming here for anyway?
