Actually, my dear, I prefer a doll with a sunny disposition... And a shady past. Oh! Kid colors, you're the tops. First, I'll take care of you. And then I'll take care of her. Oh, thank you very much, sir. What's goin' on? Six years ago they took me for half a million. Now I pay them back, all of them, starting with kid colors. Lonnegan, can I go in? I'd like to watch, huh? Huh? Not this time. You keep your eyes opened for tourists, okay? This is a private show. Private. There's the boss. How'd it go, huh? Huh? It was a short show, but a big hit. What about the body? Good-bye, kid colors. That's one. Boss, this ain't your usual style. No. You just put the word around that MacAlinski did this. "Macalin-ki." - MacAlinski. And next... Jake Hooker. Okay, Jake? She's at the table in front of the post. Got the 500 bucks? Which post, Eddie? Center post on the left. What'd I tell you, huh? If she ain't loaded with Jack, I don't know my own name. I just don't feel right about it, Eddie. She's with her mother and everything. Come on, Jake, this ain't no slight on her. She just happens to be keepin' company with cash. It ain't as if you hate the dame. Jakey, don't let her looks get to you. You remember what Fargo said? "Dames and griftin' don't mix"? Wise up! You're right. Right. I'll plant the bait. Merci. - Countess, lady Dorsett, so good to see you both. Bonsoir. And how may I assist you this evening, please? Well, we would like some more champagne. - Of course, some champagne. - And a Blue Moon Cocktail. Yes, indeed! Excuse me, ladies. May I have a word with you? Oui. You haven't by chance seen a gold watch around here, have you? Well, no, I don't believe we have, mister... Stewart. Charles Stewart. - I'm in charge of security. - Mr. Stewart. Very nice to meet you. I am Veronique LaFleur. Countess LaFleur. Well, uh, we are very sorry that you lost your watch. Oh, it wasn't mine. It belonged to a Jerome Hawthorn. He lost it in here tonight and he's very anxious to get it back. He's offering $500 for its return. Well, Mr. Stewart, if we find the watch, we will return it to you right away. Ow you say, uh, tout de suite, uh... On the double? Thank you, Countess LaFleur. - Countess, look here. - Mr. Stewart, there is. A gold watch here. Well, my goodness, there is a watch here. My, my. And it's Hawthorn's all right. And now that you found the watch, you have a reward coming. I can't take it. I don't need it. But I insist! Countess, why don't we add the money to the charity ball funds we've collected? Oh, I suppose we could. Uh, we have been collecting pledges... For the displaced persons in Europe. The stealings of war, you know, uh... Thank you. Merci. Mr. Hawthorn will be delighted. Please forgive my presumptuousness, but I can't help noticing that you keep... It's obvious that you're carrying a great deal of cash. And as a professional security officer, I'd be remiss in my duties... If I didn't inform you of the criminal element on the streets these days. Really? In this neighborhood? If you'd allow me, I'd be more than happy to show you a safe way of handling your money. - Oh, oui. - Please, do. All right, take the money that I gave you and place your money in the envelope with it. Oh. Like this? Right. You, too, lady Dorsett. - Mm-hmm. - Very good. Now seal it. Thank you. All you have to do is place it inside your sleeve... And under your arm like this. Now, you always know where it is because you can feel it, and no pickpocket will ever think of lookin' for it there. How clever. Just doin' my job, Countess. Have a good evening. Good night. Merci. Oh, waiter, complimentary check for this table. Bonsoir. Hey, Jake, that was fantastic! The way you did that, I couldn't even see a switch. Ah, it was easy. I still don't like connin' women, Eddie. Let's see what we got here. Ohhh, come to me, come to me. Jake, five bucks? Shit, Ed! Check the front, Eddie! Hey, watch it! First you say you do and then you don't then you say you will and then you won't you're undecided now excuse me. What are ya gonna do. If I find that broad, I'm gonna wring her neck! Ah, she's probably halfway home with the 500 bucks, Jake. Don't that rot your socks? I'm tellin' you, I'm sick of this town, Eddie! You can't trust anybody anymore! The berg is crawlin' with crooks. Ah, come on, Jake. Don't get carried away. Don't get carried away? This is a larcenous city. And it ain't getting any better. It says he wants you to pay the rent. What happened to the lights, Jake? That son of a bitch turned off the power. Dad-gume-it! - Telegram? - For who? For a Mr. Jake Hooker. I'm Jake Hooker. - Who's it from, Jake? - I don't know, Eddie. Where you going? I'm gonna find some light, Eddie. Ow! You okay, Eddie? I'll live. I'll limp, but I'll live. Hey, it's from Fargo Gondorff. Yeah? What's it say? It says, "greetings, pal." Got a big house with a yard. Come on down." Think he's workin' on a big con? What do you say we go down and see? How do we pay for the tickets? This is your window here, sir. You stay with the luggage, shine, and don't scratch it or I'll call a cop. I got a compartment for two to Miami. The name's O'Malley. O'Malley. I seem to be all booked up, sir. I can give you two uppers in a Pullman. Hey, can up, bub. I got a reservation for a compartment! You check your reservation. Where's my alligator bag? It's right here, honey. Don't get it lost with your crap! Come on, will ya, bub? I'm doing the best I can. Oh, look, daddy, it says they've got an observation car. See it? Really? I didn't know you could read. I could read. Come on, chowderhead, where are the tickets? - Sir, here they are. I'm sorry, I was looking in the wrong place. Sir, I must stamp those tickets. Come on, how much? That'll be 72.48. Please forgive the inconvenience. Yeah, yeah. Have a good trip, sir. Pick up the luggage! Come on, move it! I can't help him with the luggage. Oh, come on! They're too heavy! You all set? Yeah, garlic, seltzer. I'm set, Eddie. The guy's wearing a three piece Grey suit. The lady is in purple. Lots of luggage. Just because I quit school in the fourth grade doesn't mean you can treat me like shit. Excuse me, good buddy. I done went and got myself lost in this big ol' train station. I wonder if you guys could help me find the subway to Coney Island? There's a subway entrance across the terminal. What the hell's a matter with you? I get these fits. Ooh, Frankie, he looks sick. You better help him. Don't get involved! Help! Oh, my god! Your breath stinks! Come on, let's go! Mister, I seen a restroom right over there. Come on, dummy! Good idea. Wash it off. Oh, the hell with him! Hey, they're takin' a powder on that train. We better hurry if we wanna put a snatch on them. Let them go. Get in. Why you let them go? Christ, what if they skip the country or somethin' then? They're heading down to Florida to see Gondorff. They'll be back. All of them. They will? Yes. All right. Go. What'd we get, Eddie? We got a cop. A cop? That's right. Francis O'Malley. He's a detective from Brooklyn. Shit! I can't believe it. All that matched luggage. Little miss round heels. Cash. Not on a cop's salary. No way. He's gotta be on the take. How big a beef do you think this guy's gonna raise? "To my loving hubby." That bimbo he was with wasn't his wife obviously. Maybe. Boy, I wonder if Fargo's got a pool. An orange grove even. - Hey, a boat! - I bet he's got a boat! We can go fishing. Are you sure this is right? Yeah, 12875 Palmetto highway. Big house with a yard. Just relax, Eddie. Act like you belong here. Good morning, gentlemen. Hiya, Jake. Hiya, Fargo. Hiya, Eddie. Fargo, you grew a mustache. Well, even in a dump like this, it's best not to be too recognizable. How'd they ever get you in here? Remember those crime commission hearings they had a couple of years ago? Well, I got mixed up in them. So I said the kind words, got my money, and two years. How you boys doin'? Ah, not so good. - Terrific! We got a lot of investments goin', Fargo. As a matter of fact, just next week, our middleweight contender's fightin' in Jersey. Jake, I asked you to come down because I heard some bad news. And I wanted to tell it to you personally. They murdered kid colors. What? You're kiddin'... They tortured him, then dumped him in the river. - Such a sweet little guy. - We knew each other all our lives. We were pals. My old man walked out on my mother one day... never came back. One day she went out shopping, got hit by a car and killed. I went on a drunk for 14 months. Kid never left my side. Paid my bills, picked up my tabs, went all the way. Kid saved my life. I'll never forget him. Yeah, but who would want to kill the kid? How 'bout Lonnegan, that phony banker in Philadelphia? The kid was in on that con. Nah. No, I thought of Lonnegan right off the bat. But it's not his style. He hasn't got the stomach for it. Besides, the rumor around here is that a guy did it by the name of Maca... Maca... MacAlinski? Yeah, that's it. MacAlinski. Do you guys know him? Oh, yeah, he's new. You'd love this guy, Fargo. He owns a club in Coney Island. He runs Coney Island. A lot of cash, no class. He's an animal. They call him The Wolf. The Wolf, huh? Yeah. Mr. Gondorf, it's time for your poker game. Thank you, Captain Clancy. I get out of here Wednesday. What you got cookin'? Why don't you guys hang around town for a couple of days? Have some fun. Then we'll all go up north and we'll watch your fighter. You got an idea. I got an idea. What's the scam? I think I'll sting a wolf. See you Wednesday, Jake. Eddie. Doc, you son of a bitch! Fargo, good to see you. Good to see you. I stepped in a bum. I stepped out a gentleman. In the stretch they go now by a length. It's Lulu Belle. Wee Willie. Lulu Belle. Wee Willie. And it's Lulu Belle by a head. Thanks for the tip, ed. Hey, handicap, a letter. Letter for you, tuxedo. It just came. Thank you. Excuse me, sir. Hey, big Ohio, mail. Hey, what the hell's goin' on here? You know, the legit theater ain't been doin' so hot. That's why they're havin' fights here. Hey, I want you to meet Typhoon. He's somethin' special and I know special when I see it. What makes you such an expert? Hey, I was golden gloves champ mid-south. He's got a right you won't believe. Here he is. Fargo, this is Typhoon Taylor. Typhoon, Fargo. Say hello, Typhoon. Why hasn't he got his right hand taped? He never tapes his right hand. He wouldn't be able to hold the cards. Isn't that dangerous not to tape your hand? - Knock with nine. - Did I tell you he was somethin' special? - Oh, he's special, all right. - Damn it! I told you not to put ice in my drink! You want me to get cramps? - He's a little eccentric sometimes. - That's the word. Weighing 182, wearing the black trunks, Irish Billy Healy! And in this corner, weighing 192, wearing the white... The gold trunks... Typhoon Taylor! Get outta there, ya bum! Has he got guts? Wait 'til you see the right. This kid's gonna fall faster than a 29-cent pair of socks. I want a good clean fight. When I tell you to break, break. Watch your low blows. Go back to the corner now. Come out fighting at the bell. Come on, get back to the corner. Get back to the corner. Come on, don't let this upset you, Typhoon. It was just a lucky shot. Act like you're hurt. Then when he comes in, uncork the right. Come on, Typhoon, get it up, man. This don't look good. Leave me alone! A guy can only take so much. I gave it my all. Six, seven, you gave it your all? It's 30 seconds in the first round. Eight, nine, ten! If only he could've thrown just one more right. Well, that's a tough punch to throw when you're lying down. A little decorum, please. Go on, get up! Look at that punk Hooker. If I was that ugly, I'd shoot myself. I told you they'd be back. They're leaving. Sit down. I go kill them now, okay? What are we waiting for? First they pay me back. Then you can have them, all right? I don't get it. Revenge is a luscious fruit that needs a little time to... to ripen. Give those fools a little time and they'll be so trapped in my web, dear boy, that they will regret that they ever heard of me. For avenged I shall be as sure as guts are made of pudding. Guts are made of pudding? Yeah. That's Shakespeare, but don't let it bother you. "Chape-beer." Shakespeare. That's what I said, "chape-beer." Okay, let's get started. Handicap, what do ya know about this guy MacAlinski? Before the mob got him into Coney Island, he worked strong-arm in the carnival. Shell game, pool hustler, Three-card Monte, even a little magic when a magician was too stewed to work. He still likes to do a trick or two at parties. And he's real temperamental. Guy walks out on him while he's in the middle of a rope trick. MacAlinski runs both his feet through a drill press. Poor guy never walked at all after that, much less out on another MacAlinski rope trick. Guy like that must've made a few enemies during his career. Nothing he can't handle as long as he keeps his mob connections. He's got prostitution sewed up on the island. MacAlinski is a big tipper. He owns the Ocean Club down by the boardwalk. He buys a new suit every day. Wears it once and then burns it. Sheesh. That's expensive B.O.! They say he owns 54 diamond rings and 300 pairs of shoes. And he's got every vice there is. And a few I haven't heard of. But his biggest weakness is the janes. You never see him with less than four. Hence, The Wolf. Do any of these dames stay tight with him? No. He doesn't like women that much. Mm-mm. He just can't stand it if they don't like him. Maybe we could use a woman on him in the setup. If we can find one that grifts. Doesn't sound like he's an easy Mark since he knows the standard cons from his carney days. I was watchin' Jake's fighter the other night, and I got an idea for a fight con that might be good for this wolf. Now I haven't got it all figured out yet, but for starters, we're gonna need a gym. Big Ohio and handicap can take care of that. And, tuxedo, you can take care of the bookmaking. All we need now is a fighter. A real fighter? - No, one of our own. Someone who can grift. Where we gonna find a grifter who can fight? Mm-hmm. Aw, come on, boys. Come on, Fargo. Golden gloves was years ago. I haven't boxed since they elected Roosevelt president. He's still president. You're not going to get hurt. I'll take care of you. Now, tomorrow, I want you to go over to Klein's and get some gear. Let's do it. Hey, nice to see ya again. Hey, let go of me! Didn't think I'd recognize ya, did ya? Beat it, deadhead! Deadhead? My goodness, how crude for a countess. All right! So you recognize me. Big deal. So I put one over on you. So what? So this. Help! Thief! Pickpocket here. No! No, no, no. Woman stole my wallet. That is not true. The woman stole my wallet. This man is crazy! He's completely... Please! Just quiet! What seems to be the problem here? The woman is a thief. Ooh! She stole my wallet. It's in her purse. That's a lie. Absurd. Madam, will you kindly open your handbag? This is ridiculous. Is this your wallet? Of course it is. Just check the driver's license. It says Francis O'Malley, right? That's right. Looks like the gentleman is telling the truth. He is not telling the truth. He planted that wallet when he was stealing my coin purse. My coin purse is in his pocket. Please, Mr. Store manager, would you look in his pocket? Come on, you can do better than that. Please! I showed you mine. The least you can do is make him show you his. Sounds reasonable. She planted that on me. The woman is a pickpocket. He is. No, she is. He is. - Enough. - She is! He is! - Enough! I've worked in this store for many, many years. I didn't get to be floor manager by being slow on the uptake. There's a simple solution to our problem, unless you'd like me to call... The store detective or the regular police? No, no. It won't be necessary. Your wallet, sir. And, madam, your coin purse. Hey, what's the big idea trying to make a sucker out of me, you creep? Tryin' to make a sucker out of you? You owe me one, lady. I should've had you arrested in there. Oh, yeah? You and what army? You're not good enough. Think I didn't feel you slip your wallet into my purse? You got hands like anvils. Lady, if I were you I'd check your purse. Great. Anvil hands, huh? Hey, you. Does this happen to be your money clip? Well. Pretty slick. You're not bad yourself, O'Malley? It's Hooker. Jake Hooker. Veronica Sherman. Bye. Hey, uh... come here, listen. Come here. Running into you could be the best thing that's happened to me all day. Don't press your luck. Don't flatter yourself, lady. I'm not talkin' romance here. I'm talkin' business. How'd you like to get in on a really big con? We could use a woman like you. Who's we? Me and Gondorff. You know Gondorff? Just meet us tomorrow. - 710 Flatbush Avenue, second floor. - 2 o'clock. Don't count on it. See ya. How ya doin', Jake? Fargo's waitin' for you upstairs. Hey, Eddie, I thought you didn't do windows? A regular Picasso. Don't fall, Eddie. Some things are lookin' pretty good around here. Well, I'm glad you like it. You're gonna start using it soon. I've got you set for a fight with Chico Torres on the 19th. The promoter owed me a favor, so he didn't let it bother him that he never heard of you. Here's the press book we made up on ya. We sent that to all the sports writers in town. That way they don't have to go checkin' to find out who you are. It's all laid out. And here's your boxing license. I'm Bobby Florian, huh? And memorize everything that's in there. It has all your previous fights. Up to now, you're seven and one. How'd you knock out three guys in the first round? You're lethal with either hand. Hey, Fargo, there's some Jane down here wants to see ya. Well, I'll be damned, she showed up. Who showed up? Um, I think I found a girl we've been lookin' for. Her name's Veronica Sherman. I, uh, grifted with her the past couple of years. Oh? What'd you play? Oh, you know, the glim dropper, the tat, stuff like that. She's smart. She's good lookin'. And she doesn't rattle. Send her up, Ohio. How come you didn't tell me about this dame the other day? Um, I wasn't sure she was in town. You can go on up. Fargo, this is Veronica. Veronica, Fargo. So nice to meet ya. Nice to meet you. Sit down. Thank you. Jake tells me you worked a few cons together. Oh, yeah. What did you play? I told you that already. Uh, the, uh, Spanish prisoner, the, uh, tip racket, the pigeon drop. The pigeon drop? - The pigeon drop? What the hell do you take me for? I don't play no pigeon drop! I don't do tricks on old ladies! How was I to know what dumb stuff you were telling? Least you could do is fill me in. - I didn't even know you were comin'. - Well, I wasn't gonna. First I thought you were playin' footsie together. Now I can see you weren't even playin' that. What's goin' on? She reversed a switch on me a couple of weeks ago. She reversed a switch on you? Say, that's not bad. What did you say your name was? Sherill. Veronica Sherill. You told him it was Sherman. What do you want me to do, send for my birth certificate? Look, miss Sherill or Sherman or whatever the hell your name is, when we work a con together, we tell the truth, especially when we're doin' business. All right. It's Crinklaw. Veronica Crinklaw. Crinklaw. Why would you wanna change a lovely name like that? Can you play a sophisticated dame? Real high society dame? She beat me doin' a French countess. Very good. Merci. You be here tonight at 8:30. We'll run through the setup. And tomorrow, we go after our man. Everybody loves my baby. Which one is MacAlinski? The guy over there with all the dames. Turn the top card over. Is that your card? No. What was your card? Ten of diamonds. The ten of dia... Everybody loves my baby but my baby don't love nobody but me nobody but me. Has my escort Mr. Harris arrived yet? Harris? Uh... no, but I can seat you now if you like? Fine, then. Follow me, please. - All you broads, screw. - Right here? No, just get lost! Hiya, baby. Hello. All alone? Well, I was waitin' for my escort. It's all right if I wait alone here, isn't it? Hell, you're not alone anymore, sweetheart. You're with me. Ah. You're an awful good-lookin' broad. - Why, thank you. - Pardon me. While I've been around the world many, many times, I have never encountered a woman... Seemingly as charming as you are... And assuredly as attractive... And beautiful. Well, that is certainly the nicest thing anyone has ever said to me. I hope you won't think this a rude imposition... If I ask for your permission to join you just for a moment? Oh, of course. Wait a minute. What the hell do you think you're doin'? I was here first. Oh, my word, gentlemen, please don't argue on my account. I was beginning to think I was goin' to spend the evening alone. But now it looks like I have the luck of two escorts. - You can hang around... for one minute. - Thank you. Uh, may I have a cigarette? Sure. Would you care for a Galois? I have them sent from Paris from time to time. My, how continental. Well, here I am sitting with two distinguished looking gentlemen and, uh... I don't even know your names. My name is Gus MacAlinski and I own this joint. And you're probably the only broad in Brooklyn who doesn't know it. No, I didn't. And you? My name is Trevor Plantagenet. Trevor Plantagenet? My, how elegant. I mean, it really has an air of aristocracy about it. - Yeah, I once knew a faggot named Trevor. - Did you now? I wouldn't have thought you were that kind of a man. - Wait a minute now. - Wait a minute. - I'm straight! - Of course you are. - Mm-hmm. By the way, what is your name? Oh, excuse me. I'm terribly sorry. I'm Elizabeth Windsor. Well, what'll you have to drink, Liz? Scotch, bourbon, gin, vodka, rum? Name it, I got it. Perhaps you'd care for some champagne. - Yes, I think I would. - You do have champagne? Yes, we have champagne. We've got the best wine cellar in Brooklyn! I can hear it dropping. Waiter! How 'bout some Tattinger's Brut, '29? Don't stand there. Go and get it! And bring my own! My regular! A triple green river! Here comes the waiter. Tom, boss wants a bottle of champagne, Tattinger, '29. I'll see what I can do about the champagne. 29. How do you like these, babe? My, they are hard to miss, aren't they? Real rocks. Heavy gold. Heavy gold! Heavy! So, Mr. Plantagenet, I couldn't help but notice your lovely matching set of cuff links and studs and ring. It's just beautiful. Well, thank you. They were found by some archaeologists during a dig high in the Andes mountains. And the legend is that they were once owned by an Incan emperor. What the hell does a friggin' Inca know about jewelry? Huh? Can you just see Tiffany hauling ass up the side of a mountain to make some dough? Can ya? Huh? My, what a lovely tune they're playing. Listen, you're lookin' at the world's greatest ballroom dancer. Well, I'm afraid dancing is not one of my accomplishments. - They rather frowned on that at the convent. - Don't worry, sweetheart. When you're dancin' with me, you're floatin' on air. - No, uh... Come on. Ow! Hold it. Hold it. You really can't dance. Well, I was always much more of a singer. I couldn't quite catch his rhythm. On the contrary, I thought you have an innate poise and grace. Might I... have a dance? Well, if you're willin', I'm willin'. I certainly am. Watch your toes, Trevor. How's it goin' with the new broad? She's crazy about me. I'm not surprised. I got a big bet with an old friend. No, don't look-a. Look-a this way. A Manhattan-a gets a Maraschino cherry. A-side-a-car, she-a no get Marischino cherry, but she-a no get bitters either. See? Huh? In your Manhattan, you got your bourbon. Unless you use scotch, then it's what you call a Rob Roy. Now, a sidecar... You just use quantro. Quantro? That's right. You dance just beautifully. Oh. And don't let anyone tell you anything different. Well, I suppose it took the right man to bring out the best in me. Ah, the champagne. Oh! I'll open it. First, you get the cap off. You have to do it slowly. - Oh, my! - Oooh! What a shame! Let me sop that up for you. Mr. MacAlinski! Your head! Is this what you're looking for? Gimme that! Now, please, MacAlinski, no violence. We've had enough embarrassment for an evening. Come on, Betty, we'll go to see that tournament. A tournament? How delightful. What's all this about a tournament? The national pocket billiard championships. I got a pool table in the back. You wanna play me? How 'bout bank ball? Let's say for, oh, a thousand dollars a game. We can have our own little tournament right here. Sounds exciting. Would you really like to see that? Mm-hmm. I'm game. It'll be worth a thousand to see an expert at work. By the way, just what is bank ball? You understand it's the best out of five for one thou? Watch these rings for me, will ya, doll? Of course. Now you're gonna see these powerful hands go to work. Well, good luck. Whoopsie. Oh. That's the first time I've miscued since I was nine years old. That's one. Remarkable. Two! Amazing. Three. Four. Four out of five, Trevor. Your shot. That means I have to make five out of five. That's right. Five out of five to beat me. That's practically an impossibility. Easy does it, Trevor. Pretty lucky, Trevor. Well, I try to make it sporting. And now just to make it a little more exciting. That's five. You... you are a hustler, you son of a bitch! Don't you ever call me a hustler! Wait a minute. You're taking a thousand dollars of my money. I'm gonna get a chance to win it back! Seems fair enough. How? How about a card game? Bring me a deck of cards. What kind of a card game? A simple game. He'll learn fast. Mm-hmm. We won't use a full deck. We'll just use three cards. Here. A little game from Kalamazoo. The black's for me and the red's for you. All you have to do is watch the red card. Now, for a thousand dollars, Trevor, just follow the Ace. Chase it. Trace it. See if you can place it. Sweetheart, why don't you pick the card? You've been lucky for me tonight. Are you sure you want me to do it? Sure. Go ahead. Well, all right. Well, I don't think it's... Uh, it's this one. And I know it's-it's not, uh... This one. So, it must be that one. And she must be psychic. Ha. Come along, sweetheart, we're goin' to dinner. Good night, Mr. MacAlinski. Uh, count this on the way out. Bye-bye. What did you do with that, uh... Ace? That's for the wine. If there's anything left over, have your wig... dry cleaned. What happened, boss? I'll tell you what happened. That's what happened! Goddamn it! Uh, Mr. MacAlinski, sir. I'd like to talk to... Uh, Mr. MacAlinski, I gotta... He don't wanna talk to nobody. It's about Trevor Plantagenet. Okay? Boss. This gazoonie says he wants to talk to you about that Trevor guy. Bring him here. Bring him up. Howdy. Move. Where we goin'? The boss is takin' his ride. Ride? Evening, Mr. MacAlinski! Yeah! What are you lookin' at? Nothin'. Nothin'. - You? You wanna talk? Talk while we ride. - These things make me nervous... If you don't ride, you don't talk. My name's Bobby Florian. I'm a fighter. What's that got to do with Trevor... What the hell's his last name? Plantagenet, sir. He... well, sir, he... Come on, let's go! Plantagenet! Well, sir, Trevor owns my contract, but he ain't treatin' me fair and square. The thing that happened with your hair tonight, he's been plannin' that for weeks. It was a bet he made with these two colored guys that run prostitution in the Bronx. They wanted to embarrass you at your own club. Was the girl in on it? No, no. I never seen her before. What do you want, kid? Look, I could be a champ. I've won my first four fights by knockouts. I get a chance with a contender named Barragon, and Trevor asked... Trev... Oh, no! Uh... Mr. Trevor tells me I gotta take a dive. Turn it off! What can I do? He's a mean man. So I take a dive. So then my next three fights he lets me alone. I win 'em all easy. Now I get another shot with a guy named Torres next week. He comes to me, he says I gotta go on the take again. What do you need me for? I need protection. If I don't take that dive, Trevor's boys are gonna break my legs. Now, I don't know if you got the muscle or not. What do ya mean no muscle? - Trevor says you're just a two-bit hood. - Me, a two-bit hood? He... he just says it. That what Trevor says. Oh. Okay, what's in it for me? I got my life savings on this fight, $6,000. Now, if I was to give you 20%, say at even odds, you'd get, uh... Twelve-hundred dollars. Right. That's worth some protection, right? - Five minutes worth. - Well, what if I cut you in for 50%? Come on, come on. Come on. Hey, what gym do you train at? Down at Goldings, on Flatbush Avenue. So what do ya say? Will you help me? What should I do, call you at the club? If I wanna talk, I'll find ya. Great ride, eh, kid? Great. Did you pay the check? Can I have a bicarbonate soda, waitress? I thought I told you to pay the check. You didn't gimme no cash. Oh, for crying out loud. Can I have the check? Hey, don't I know you? Who me? No, I am from Poland. Immigrant. It's no possible, huh? Yeah, I know you. Remember me? I'm detective O'Malley. I am gonna bury you so deep in the tank... You son of a bitch! I'll get you! I'm gonna tear your goddamn nose off! You dirty little shit! Come back here, you son of a bitch! Goddamn it! Come... Come back here! I got you now, you bloodsuckin' foreign degenerate. Aaah, shit! Damn it! You're late. How'd it go? I don't know. I'm tellin' you this guy MacAlinski's a cold fish. I don't know if I got a hook in him or not. What'd he say when you told him about the Torres fight? Nothing really. I don't know if hates you enough yet. It's not enough if he hates me. He has to find out a way to make money from hating me. He'll figure it out. There's somethin' else. Uh... - I ran into this guy O'Malley tonight. - What? Who the hell is O'Malley? O'Malley is this cop we took to get train fare to Florida. We boosted his lever. Beautiful. Smart. He's on to you, huh? He knows I'm in town. What do ya think, Fargo? Just lay low. Keep outta sight. I'm... I'm not worried about myself. I just don't wanna blow this one for you guys, or for kid colors. It's gettin' a little late. Let's go to bed. You gotta see this. They're using some kind of boxing scam. They're peddling Hooker as a fighter. And they tied into MacAlinski last night. Yes, I know. Sam Scanlon told me. He heard that Gondorff played MacAlinski like a real society gentleman. He used some strange name. What was it? Uh... Trevor... Trev... Trevor Plantagenet. Yeah. When do I kill him? You can't. MacAlinski's gonna kill him for us. Oh, come on, please. Let me do my job. What are you paying me for? We out-con the con man and MacAlinski pulls the trigger. We get all the satisfaction, none of the responsibility. MacAlinski is the ideal weapon. "When to mischief mortals bend their will, how soon they find the instruments of ill." Shakespeare? Uh-uh. - Pope. - The Pope said that? Alexander Pope. We're to reap of the luck. He was a poet, dear boy. Aaah. If I was in the ring with that guy, I'd make poetry out of his face. Work it! Come on, Jake, protect your ribs! Again, let's go! Set it up, combination. How 'bout some more on the speed bag? Mm-mm, big trouble. Jake, you ain't never gonna get any better in the time that we got. Stick to the basics. But it's so boring. Two more minutes. Keep your arms up. Come on, come on. Move it. Quiet! Shut up! This ain't no Jack Dempsey, ya understand? - Can I stop now? You're not going to get into shape just standing there sweating. What's the difference? I'm gonna lie down anyway. You gotta make it look good. Or else MacAlinski's gonna know something's wrong. You can't walk in and get pulverized. How good is this guy Torres anyway? What difference does it make? - You're gonna lie down anyway. - Yeah, but I don't wanna lie down forever. Come on, get goin'. The hell with that. Hey, MacAlinski just pulled up outside. All right, boys, let's get movin'! Ohio, get in the ring with Jake. And, Ohio. Yes? Get hit a lot. Give him the haymaker! What the hell is the matter with you? I told you not to throw that right hook! Suppose some sportswriter were here. Sorry, Mr. Plantagenet. I guess I just... Forgot myself. That's it. That's it. I've had enough. Okay, okay. All right, Bobby, knock off for a while. What are you doin' here? Looking for that Ace? Your boy looks pretty good. Doesn't he? Mac... may I call you Mac? I'd like... I'd like to give you a little tip, by way of an apology for the other night. Sure, I'm always open for a tip. Only I don't figure you letting me in on a good thing. Mac, if you put a bundle on that kid, you cannot lose. Is that the truth? I appreciate it. Thanks for the tip, Trevor. My club, 9:00. He swallowed the worm. Prospect park. What, are they complaining it's too cold? Howdy, Mr. MacAlinski. Hey! Hey, wait a minute! What's goin' on? We called the boxing commission. They never heard of a Bobby Florian. That's 'cause I did all my fightin' in California. Look, my license is in my inside pocket. Look. Let him go. Come on, sit down. Hmph! Your owner is even lower than I thought he was. He wanted me to put some money on you even after he's told you to take a dive. Told you he had it in for you. He wants you to lose your shirt. How much is that bastard layin' on Torres? Two hundred grand. But that's not the only way he wins. The character you saw today at the gym with the fancy clothes, that's Harry Chancellor. He's Plantagenet's bookie friend. Harry's givin' two-to-one on Torres just to get people to put bets on me in his parlor. And he knows you're gonna dump the fight? They build up the bets on me, and then they split the take. It's not fair. They both get rich, and I'm supposed to just get lost. But if I beat this bum, which I intend to do, they're both gonna lose a lot of money. So whoever puts money on you at Chancellor's odds, they're gonna walk away with a bundle. That's right. I'm puttin' my life savings on it. 'Course, I'm havin' a friend bet it for me. Yeah. Hmm. Walk away with a bundle. Okay, Florian, I wanna see you fight. But you saw me fight today. I mean against somebody good. Why? All I'm askin' for is protection. You won't get any protection unless I see you fight. Trevor's never gonna let me fight before the Torres match. We'll go to another gym. What if I get cut or somethin'? You won't if you're any good, but if you're not, then you might as well take that dive. Okay, okay. Pick you up tomorrow morning, 10:00... In front of the Carnasie Bijou. - Okay, kid, you can go. - Yes, sir. Hey! Wait a minute! Let me outta here! Hey! Hey, you! Hey, you! Hey, let me down! Let me down, will ya? Stop this thing! Out of the way! Ah, honey, it's on the track. Don't leave me now! - Gotcha now, you little shit! - Hey, you're bleeding! Hey, stand still, you son of a bitch! Come back here, you flinthead! You son of a bitch! You dirty, rotten... I'm gonna kill you! Hey, it's the puker! Hey, that thing has to come back here, right? That's right, Jack. Oh, geez! No! God! Ooh! Shit! What happened to the guy who was in there? He probably fell off and killed himself. Oooh! Oh, geez! Hey, mister, you got a light? That guy you looking for. We both have a mutual interest in him. Yeah? Listen, my boss would like to talk to you. And he will make it worth your while. You know what I mean? I know you're a cop, and I know what kind of a cop you are, okay? I'm not asking you to look the other way. You're gonna get your man because I'm gonna give him to you. Why not now? Because he's running a little con that's gonna backfire on him. I don't want anything to interfere with that, see? Uh-uh. No, I'm sorry. I can't turn my back on crime. Try. Is this yours? I seem to recall you dropped it just now. Yeah, it's mine. The man you're looking for is taking a few people for a lot of money. When he does, you make the collar, I get my satisfaction... And you get all the glory, and a little taste, besides. You know, you're pretty well-informed about somebody else's con, mister. How do you know so much? I've got my sources. Okay, you got him now. But after you're through with him, I get him. Him and his friends. I bet two cents. Your two, and two better. I know you're bluffing. If you know... In your heart and soul that I'm bluffing, back it up. I raise you two cents more. And I see. Now what have you got? A pair of aces. A pair of aces? Yeah. You win. I was bluffin'. Jake, what happened to you? We got problems. What problems? MacAlinski wants to see me fight again. - Wait a minute. He already saw you fight. - He ain't convinced. He wants me to fight one of his guys at his gym. Oh. Well, what are we gonna do about that? I don't know. I'll think of somethin'. It gets worse. That cop O'Malley made me tonight. He chased me all over Coney Island. - I just barely gave him the slip. - One problem at a time. How ya feelin' today, kid? Pretty good. Good. I'm puttin' you in with Tony here. Tony Savitt, meet Bobby Florian. He'll give you a tussle. Where we gonna fight? The 8th Street gym. Nobody hardly goes there anymore. It's too far away. Two fingers. That means it's the 8th Street gym. Step on it. Uh-oh. We gotta go back. Why? I forgot my... thing. What thing? You know, the... the thing you wear to protect yourself. Oh, you mean your jockstrap. Yes, sir. Well, we'll get one of the guys to lend you one. Oh, I'd... I'd really rather not do that. Uh, I borrowed one once when I was a kid and I got those... things. What things? You know, those... bugs that... that bite. Oh, you mean the crabs? Yes, sir. There's a sporting goods place back near the square. Okay. He got the crabs. Okay, turn around. Yeah? Is the owner around? Mr. Pyle, someone to see ya. Uh, hello, I'm from life magazine. I called earlier. I don't remember no calls. Oh, you must. Remember I called, I said we're gonna do an eight-page spread on... The great boxing gymnasiums in this country? We're gonna do the lead on your place. At least I thought it was this place. Maybe it's that place across Turner's. Excuse me. No, no, no, no! This is the right one, mister. Turner's is a dump. Sure, I remember you now. We got more champions here than you can shake a stick at. - Ain't that right, Egan? - Yeah. That's what I'm talkin' about. What we need is jump ropes and all the men you have. Egan, get some jump ropes. Come on in. I wanna show you the place. Okay, Ohio, Eddie, get goin'. Oh, yeah, this kid's gonna be a champ someday. All right, everybody! Okay, okay, drop everything! We're gonna have pictures in life magazine. Now, I want all you guys to come with me. Attention, everybody stop what they're doin'. Name is Brower. I'm from the gas company. This is an emergency. There is a gas leak in this building that's about to explode. I want you to clear out immediately. Not this way! Not this way! That's where the leak is! To the fire escape! To the fire escape! Run for it! Run! Run! - And clear the building! - Fellas, go over to the loading docks. We'll take the pictures over there. Come on in, guys. Skip rope, punch the bag. Come on! Okay, smile. Okay, good. Hold it right there. All right, lift your fists higher. Higher. Too high. A little lower. Good, good. Okay. Hello! My name is Pyle. Lonny Pyle. I manage this place. What can I do for you? Well, we'd like to use one of your rings. I wanna test these boys for a couple of rounds. Yeah, well, as you can see, we're a little busy here. Would you mind waitin'? All right, you guys in number one, clear out, huh? Now! Why don't you take number one. There's a nice comfortable chair. I'll take your boys to the locker room. Okay, uh... all right, this way. Follow me. Now what happens? Get that other guy's mouthpiece out of his bag and bring it to me in the office. Mouthpiece? - Here, hold this flag. Here, hold it up nice. Too much. Too much. Gimme the flag. Gimme, gimme, gimme. Good, good, good. Methyl chloride. Number two. What's that? Ether. Mm. Isn't he gonna smell that or taste it? What's that? What we have here is a little lucky tiger hair tonic. Once Savitt bites down on this, he won't be able to walk, let alone fight. And one, and two... All right, hold it, stop. Stop. All right, stop. It's wrong. What do ya mean? What do ya mean it's wrong? Look, don't talk to me! That guy, right outta there, he was right outta rhythm. Now, you wanna talk to somebody, talk to him; Don't talk to me. He's outta rhythm. You're outta rhythm? Get in rhythm! I'm sorry. Get in rhythm or get the hell outta here! Eee Hey, you need a mouthpiece there, tiger. Tastes like I just had a haircut. Oh. Well, that's the antiseptic we use, son. Good luck. All right, let's see somethin'. Come on, Florian! Fight, for Christ's sake! - Do I have to hit him again? - Finish him! Come on, get him to the car. Pretty good, kid. I didn't know you carried that much power. Go on, go on, take a shower. Yes, Sir. Meet me in the car. Yeah, you know, I've been in this business 30 years, and I ain't never seen a guy... With a punch like that. Up, down. Down, up. All together. A-one and a-two and a... uh-uh. You in the white, what are ya doin'? All together, down, up. Okay, lads. It's all clear. Wait a minute, wait a minute. Just right to the camera here. Hold it. And... got it. Thank you very much. You can come up now. You got your protection, Florian. Do what you want to Torres. Thanks, Mr. MacAlinski. Torres'll be even easier than ol' Savitt here. I guaran-damn-tee it. One more thing. Where do I find this bookie Chancellor? Oh, uh, it's up near the Stillman Auditorium. Uh, 118 North Cumberland Street. Oh, and ask the guy to see some Webster Jade. Webster Jade? Yes, sir. See ya at the fights. Seemed like I was goin' down even before I got hit. Right. Sure, Tony, sure. Your footwork stinks. What are you doin' here? Eddie told me you'd be down here... So I just came down to wish you luck. Thanks. I'm gonna need it. Oh, what are you worried about? You're not gonna win, are you? I haven't fought for real in years. Even better. You see this face? Mm-hmm. Tomorrow it's gonna look like it caught on fire and Torres put it out with a meat cleaver. That sounds serious. Maybe you and I should go a few rounds. Come on. Come on, that hurts. Oh, really? Ooh, you are in bad shape. Come on, put up your Dukes. Why don't you let me give you a workout? I really have to work out. Oh. Oh, right. Sorry. None of this before a fight. You're gonna lose anyway. Hey. That's below the belt. I'm just testing your reflexes. Well, you keep it up, you're gonna wind up flat on your back, you know? Not a bad idea. Mmm, Jake. Take off your gloves. Hey, you. May I help you? I wanna see some Webster Jade. Some Webster Jade? Webster Jade. Just a moment. Uh, Mr. Chancellor? There's a man here to see you... About some Webster Jade. Right. You may go in now. Through the double doors. Chancellor, my name is MacAlinski. Of course it is. Didn't I see you in Golding's Gym once? That's right. I was there lookin' over a fighter named Bobby Florian. And I'd like to put a little money on him. I understand you're in a bettin' mood. Oh, I'm giving two-to-one against him. I don't think the kid has a chance. How wrong do you think I am? About 400 grand worth. Most books wouldn't take that bet, but then most books aren't sporting men, either. Me, I like to live dangerously. I take risks that others don't take. I mean, that's what life is all about: Taking risks. Yeah, whatever you say. Jerry, I'm sending in a Mr. MacAlinski with a big bet on Florian. Take his money. And, uh, give him a free drink. He's a real plunger. - I forgot the key. - You what? I'll get it. Over one million dollars. I hope this guy Torres is a sure bet. I'd hate to see that kind of green disappear. Well, we'll know in a couple of minutes, won't we? Scanlon's on the phone in the next room. That cop's here. Tell him to come in. Come on. I assume you're here for your information, dear boy. Tonight's the night. Even the Brooklyn D.A.'s waitin' for this one. Yes, well you can both relax. There's a Chinese market at 121 Mott Street. At the back, in the middle meat locker, is where they meet. That's where they're gonna make the split tonight. Tell me somethin'. How do you find out stuff like this? Let's just say I've got a source. Think I could use it sometime? Why don't you ask yourself? Sam, you off the phone yet? Um... Samantha Scanlon, this is detective Francis O'Malley. Oh, so you're the guy that's gonna make the biggest bunco collar in Brooklyn, huh? That's right. Hey, uh, think maybe you and I could do each other a favor sometime? Huh? I mean, I like the way you work. All it takes is money. Yeah. Oh, Lonnegan, nice doin' business with ya. Some day when I make inspector, I'll return the favor. You do, dear boy. - Jerk! - Hmm. What's the word on MacAlinski? Well, he went for 400 grand. I just talked to Jake on the phone. He's gonna throw the fight just as soon as it looks like it's not too phony. So now you can put your million on Torres over at king Rafferty's place. See how it works, Carlos? Not only do we get back the 500 thousand we lost, another half million bucks on top. Meetin' Gondorff was the best thing that ever happened to me. Yeah, well that's all very nice, but I gotta go meet Gondorff, so you owe me 40 grand, Lonnegan. You earned every penny, sweetheart. Look, I'll be leaving a little early tonight. I don't wanna be there when MacAlinski sees Jake take the dive, you know? I wish I had ten more like you. Hmm. See ya later, shorty. Have a nice evening, boys. Next time I'm in Philadelphia, I'll look you up. See how it went. Some broad! Whew. Know what I still don't get? How come you told O'Malley where they're gonna be? Insurance. Because if MacAlinski doesn't kill him, O'Malley will bust him, dear boy. Either way, we get our money, we get our men. I bet on MacAlinski. Me too. A million dollars worth. Do you know where king Rafferty's is? No. Well, you find out. And you, find the key. Sorry. First of all, a nice Stillman Auditorium welcome... For the honorary Mayor of Brooklyn, Seymour J. Falnutti! Well, how do you feel, kid? I'm all right. How good do I gotta feel to get knocked out? Just don't take a half-gainer until at least the fifth round. Fifth round? Did you see the muscles on this guy? I don't know if I can last five rounds. Just do the best you can. You may surprise yourself and go six. I don't wanna go six. I wanna go in there and get creamed and get out early. Now, look, you better make this thing look convincing, or MacAlinski's gonna know he's been had... And none of us will get out of here alive. Time to go, kid. Smile. Huh? Ladies and gentlemen, continuing a great card here at the Stillman Auditorium, we come to the ten-round semi-main event of the evening. Weighing in at 172, from Bayonne, New Jersey, the puerto Rican pugilist, Chico Torres! And to my right, weighing in at 171 pounds, okay, box, stay awake. The kid from California, Bobby Florian! Get him, honey! Good luck. Look at him jumpin' around, like he was actually gonna make a fight of it. He's a cake eater. I guess it's about time I told MacAlinski the bad news. Well, you better hurry because he don't look like he's gonna last more than 30 seconds. All right! Hello, Gus. Lonnegan. What are you doin' here? - Who'd you bet your money on? - Florian. He's a hell of a puncher. How much you got on him? Four hundred grand. I saw him fight. I know what he can do. Yeah, so do I. He's no fighter. Never has been. His name's Jake Hooker. Been a grifter for years. And he's gonna go flat on his backside in two minutes time. What about his manager? His name is Fargo Gondorff. He's one of the all-time great con men. You've been had, dear boy. You've been had. Looks like ol' Hooker's gonna get ready to go home, spend some of your money. Okay, the two of youse, get down to that bookie's and switch the bet. But, Boss, you can't do that. Don't tell me I can't do that! Get down there! And don't forget that Chancellor guy! Bring Chancellor here to me! When they took me for half a million six years ago, I never thought anybody would be that stupid to be stung the same way. But I guess they made you look that stupid tonight. Sorry to have to be the one to tell you. I'll be seein' you. Am I cut already? It's nothin'. I'll fix it. Geez, that guy's a windmill. It's all right, Jake. You're doin' great. Just keep away from him. - You can go the distance, huh? - Geez! Give him an uppercut! Black closet. Freeze, worm! Good thing you're here, Mr. Chancellor. Mr. MacAlinski wants to change his bet to Torres. Well, I can't do that. The fight started. Do it. Uh, the-the bet's off. Just-just take your money back. No! The whole bundle goes on Torres. MacAlinski's orders. Tear up his slip. Now, Chancellor, you're comin' with us. Wait, wait. The-the coat. And, you, if anything goes wrong, your friend is dead. One, stay down, Bobby. Stay down. Take the eight count. Two, three, four, five, take the full eight! Six... Next round oughta be the one. Jake, you're heroic. Yeah, I went five, huh, Fargo? Yeah. Now you're gonna go six and you're gonna knock this guy on his ass. - Huh? - Take a look to your left. That's MacAlinski, and he's got tuxedo. Now look up center. Looks like Gondorff is telling pretty boy it's time to check out. Lonnegan! What's Lonnegan doing here? Lonnegan told MacAlinski about the con. And unless you beat this bum, we're gonna be tortured, shot and dumped in the river. Of course, I don't wanna pressure you. What about Lonnegan? Forget about Lonnegan. Just go out there and beat this bimbo. Hey, Jake, you can do it. Torres has gotta be tired. Nobody can keep dishin' out punishment like that. Go get him. Come on. He's given you everything he's got. He's punched out. Go! Four, five... Stay down! Get a hold of yourself! You can do it, Bobby! Get him, Bobby! - What the hell's going on here? - Yo! Yo! Yeah! One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten! Ladies and gentlemen, the winner in a real great fight, two minutes, thirty-six seconds, Bobby Florian! Florian was on the level. Lonnegan, he's the guy that burned us. Come on! Sit down! What about... Ow where's the goddamn car? Pendejo. Conio. It's about time, buddy! Get us out of here, dear boy. Hey, not so hasty. Chumps! Come on, don't be rushed. You knew what Lonnegan was up to all along? Soon as I found out that Lonnegan knocked off kid colors... And tried to blame MacAlinski, I knew the score. So how'd you get your information? Veronica. Veronica? It's the cooler on the right. Just lock up the shop like nothing's happened. Hey, Sam, wait for me outside. Sam, keep an eye on that Chinaman. - Veronica! - When I went into the pen, I sent her up to Philadelphia to get next to Lonnegan. I knew as soon as I got out, he'd come after us. I wanted to keep an eye on him. He hired Veronica right away. She tipped me off to everything he was doin', but she didn't find out about kid colors until later. O'Malley, you sure these guys are comin'? Of course. I bet my shield. Geez, Fargo, why didn't you just tell me? I could've let you know she was in on the ground floor, but I didn't want you to get too friendly with her. And how was I to know that you'd be dumb enough to fall for her? I didn't fall for her. I just don't like playin' the pasty, that's all. Is there a Francis O'Malley here? Yeah, I'm O'Malley! Hello, Francis O'Malley Fargo sends his best sorry he can't be here he says "stick it in your ear". Thank you very much. Get outta here! MacAlinski bet on me, didn't he? Actually, no. He switched his bet when he thought you were going into the tank. We got his money clean. And not only that, but Veronica got Lonnegan to lose all his loot... By placing a bet with our favorite bookmaker, king Rafferty. We fixed the match. We get half the loot. Well, where do we split the take then? Uh, Veronica has yours. Veronica? Well, that's just great! Where the hell is she? I don't know. She was supposed to meet us. She better show up, that's all I can say. Fargo, whatever made you think I could beat Torres in the first place? I don't know, Jake. But you have a way of ignoring the reality of things that always pulls you through. The truth is, Jake, you're the most courageous grifter I've ever known. Why don't you wait for her? Take the next train west. Okay. Torres, pleasure doin' business with ya. Vaya con dios. I didn't think you'd make it through the fifth. You got a lot of spunk, kid. Fargo pulled the emergency cord. So where's my split? Fargo said I should hang onto it for you. He says I should, uh, take care of ya. Well, what does he know? My father always knows what he's talkin' about. Your father? Yeah. My dad. Come here.
