Otona ni Nattara (When I grow up) -Airi you did your best during the test this time. -You're using lipstick, right?! -Mom, i'm an adult. Not yet, you're still a kid Thanks for the food Airi (chatroom) Eh really?! Konomi: Good morning (^o^) Yes, I woke up already Nanami: Finally I bought a Louis Vuitton bag. -You'll be late. -Okay! -Don't come back home late, okay? -Stop, like i'm a lilte kid. i'm leaving I'm leaving. So sunny! I'm leaving. -Morning. -Morning Konomi. What a nice weather, right? -Homework... -Did you finish it, you didn't right? Fuck... You didn't do it, right? (What's on the blackboard) Do you understand? (What's on the blackboard) You have the answer. That's it for today. Bow. -Lunch break... -I really can't do it... -Our class is boring, they are just kids. No matter how you look at yourself, we are not kids. Well, we can't escape from the reality that we are kids. I don't like beeing a kid. -Hey... let´s play! -Let´s go~! Ah this is the best. Just as I thought.. Did you finish homework? (Hanagawa Konomi) You are not doing it yet. I haven´t finished yet even thought it´s not that much. But I haven´t fucked yet. I asked my sister who has fucked before if she prefers a man or a pole. Then, which one is better? Hey...Hey... Sis, sis! A pole or a man, which one is better? Definitely... A pole. Definitely a pole! -Definitely a pole she said. -I see. Just as I thought a pole is better. But i haven´t seen any girl fucking a pole. You willl feel embarrased to do that when you grow up, even though you really want to. -After all kids are free. -But I want to do it asap... -Sex... -You can sell your love in Shibuya like Nanami. -Ehh! -An older man... -Buy bags and cosmetics using some old man's money. -That´s the adult's world. -Nanami is an adult, right? Wow, she´s cool. Yeah, she´s an adult. -They have been acting strange lately. -For me Nozomi is good enough. -Airi is impossible... -Konomi would be my choice -What´s wrong with them They keep staring at us. It just shows they are idiots, they should stop. Idiots! :( Idiots... -Can you go on Monday? -I wonder what to do. -I love you. - What was that? You sound like a girl.. I like you. Wait for me. -Last time we meet today. -I see. He said he likes me. It's the first time it happened to me. I couldn't believe it. It's a kid's thing. I don't know if I'll change my heart,. He's such a show-off. Hahaha see you later okay. I wonder where you get all that excitement and happiness. I was excited when I created my first homepage. Then, I saw an erotic website for the first time. -I felt so excited. -But we can't write things like that in our homework! -Shall we write about the excitement we felt when we visited the zoo for the first time? How about the excitement of riding an elephant for the first time? It's nothing special. A similar feeling to falling asleep on a bus and waking up on shock from some noise? Ahh, I want something different, like a feeling that would make the world stop. But in the end, everyone does the same things. Something different. The school is always in the same place, always gathering at the same time, always the same lunch break.. Waking up early... -What? -That's good, let´s do it! Listen.. At that time, when I was on my way to school..hum... I fell to the lake and my panties got wet.. So..so... I removed them and threw them to the lake. I went to school like that. Spent that day without panties. I felt a bit excited. Panties... :) That´s interesting -For real? But our classmates are just kids.. Airi. -Ahh, amazing.. -No way! I will also do it.. -Remove it...remove it... -So good...ah~~ SO GOOOOOOD~~~~~~! I... -Hum? -Nothing. -Let´s just throw it somewhere -Where? -Ahh, i feel so excited and happy.. -Me too! -Ahh cuteee... -So cuteee.. -Let´s go.. -Konomi, Sorry can´t see the panties 1..2... -Later i will show you the bag. - I dont´t want to see it... -It´s just a bag.. Do you want me to introduce all of you to him? No thanks. Who dropped these panties? In a place like this, pervert! Everyone! Sit down! You there! Be quiet! Now, did anyone finish the homework from last week? That´s what i thought..show me..show me.. hand me your homework. Hey! The three of you! I'm sorry.. Please, wait outside. Be quiet! As a teacher, I think the three of you are the most mature in this class, do you understand? I was expecting more, but... -But? -If we write what we really fell, you will get mad at us. What would you write about if you were a kid? Same as every other kid. Don't peek. Hum... I will forgive today. Please, finish it until next week. -Yes. -Go back inside. Okay, the class begins now. -Everyone, what do you want to become when you grow up? -I want to become the president of a company -You? -The president of a company. -Hairdresser -Nurse -(Inaudible) -Soccer player -Finding talents -You? -Professional bowling player. -You? -A fashion designer. I want to become a worldwide famous singer. I want to become a model. When I grow up... ~~ I want to make my first porn when I grow up. But, with whom? With a pole? It's so boring..so silent.. So boring, so silent... So boring, so silent... -So boring, so silent... -When I grow up.. When I grow up..when I grow up.. Run away idiots! Become a serial killer in a mass murder. Killing people in a crowded intersection, kill them all. When I grow up.. When I grow up... When I grow up... I want to become an ordinary person . Meeting an ordinary man...and fall in love. I can think about it later. It will be exciting, but if we fight, it will end very fast. -You're are cheating! -I didn't! -Why are you doing that? I hate it! -Everyone is looking at us. It's none of their business! -You don't understand the feeling! -I don't want to break up. Enough! You are a cheater! If you understand the feeling, you shouldn't have done it. Join a company. Getting married to an ordinary man. I will be happy even as a bored housewife. It's moving! You can feel it. Yes yes. -Oh amazing. -You will be born soon. We are waiting for you. Okay, that's it! (Inaudible) -It's noisy. -You are making a cute face. -I'm in trouble. -Cute, cute.. Hey you! Your mom's panties!? Let's go. Wait, i'm going too. -When did you put your panties back? -Just now. -Airi too? -Of course. -Damn it. My pride got hurt. If I was Cameron Diaz, they wouldn't make fun of me for not using panties. -It's better to dress normally. -From now on. Ah, damn it. If I was an adult, I would commit suicide now. -Suicide is even sillier. -Will it be okay? -You are our main suspect! -That's right. Why do you think those panties are mine? -We are trying to find out. -We are almost coming to a conclusion. I won't say anything because you look nervous. -Crazy! -Pervert! Tell me your goals in life. Tell me the mission you were born for. Not for youselves. -Do you have any value to us? -Stop. What would Cameron Diaz do in this situation? -Cameron Diaz... -Cameron Diaz wouldn't even look at them. -Enough. -What? I will show you. What's wrong? Come here, come. Come closer, come closer. -You are scared huh? -You can't do that. You are both scared too? Never forget this. How was it? -What happened? -It wasn't a big deal. -You don't want to see that. Let's go. -What about you Konomi? -Eh? -When you grow up? -Lawyer. -Lawyer!? Ehh -We are still kids -We can think about it later I will do my best to become a lawyer . You have the power to kill people as a lawyer. I'm not someone who wants to kill people. But if I help a bad person, I will also become one. Hey, can you show me your panties? I will give you money. This old man was also an elementary school student in the past. -Also a little kid. -Old man! -Hey, let's do it. -No way, I'm not using panties yet. -1,2... Thanks for waiting! -Nanami. -What are you doing? -It's okay. -Don't worry. -We won't steal your boyfriend. We will only show him When you grow up. Dad, hurry up let's go. -Fuck! -Eh?! -Like this. -Like this? This way, right? At the same time. Fuck you!
