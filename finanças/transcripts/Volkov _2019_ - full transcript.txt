- Fucking hate this place. - Hey, hey girl, come to poppa. - Fuck off. - Have a good one, girl. - Brutus, baby, I'm done. - All right. - Damn, bitch. What the? - Get off her. It's supposed to be my day off today. I could have been at home eating a bloody steak with a bottle of whiskey, watching the poppy marathon and cleaning off my bitch named Daisy. But instead I'm dealing with motherfuckers like you. So listen up real good, okay? If you ever even get a thought of touching one of my girls, I'll rip your fucking head off. I'm gonna stick it up your ass. I'm gonna see if you can find your heart beat. You got that? - Yeah. - What's my name? - Brutus. - What's my mother fucking name? - Brutus, Brutus, Brutus. - Get the fuck outta here. Respect the lady and grab that. - Thanks, Brutus. - Anytime, sweetie. - I hate this fucking place. - So, found your brother? - No, not yet. Any leads? - Just one. - So why the hell do we need to meet so suddenly? I told them there was nothing new to report right now and meeting like this is risky. How do you eat that shit? I fucking hate this dive. - Well, you chose it. - You boys need anything? - Fuck what Nicks says, this is a good burger. - Best in town. What about you, you need anything? - Nope. - Fucking asshole. - It was a necessary move Nick. We gotta pull you in. - On your authority? Are you trying to get me fucking killed? - No, on their authority. The latest intel says you're already at a high risk. - That's fucking bullshit. I spent too much goddamn fucking time on this thing. That's fucking crazy. - Well, it's not your decision. Have you found Volkov? - It hasn't been easy. I was so close, Matty, so fucking close. But he slipped through my fingers in Kaliningrad. Every time I get close to this motherfucker, he disappears. The man is a fucking ghost. - It's not what I expected to hear. Are you slipping, Nick? It doesn't matter. We already got other leads. You've done all you can do. They want you off now. So let's make this easy, there's a plane waiting for us. - Matty, I'm not going anywhere. You'll get your meeting, maybe even find your brother. - All right everybody, get the fuck out. Go! - Break him. Get that son of a bitch up. Finish him. Finish him! - Get that motherfucker up. - Let's get him out of here. Get him out of here. - Cock sucker. - Let's go, get him out. Get him out of here. - You never fucking listen. Agent Rae would be real proud of you. Get him the fuck out of here. - Put this piece of shit in the fucking van, come on. It's done. It's done. - Where the fuck you guys been? - Where I been, don't give me shit, man. - Volkov's waiting. - No, listen. - Volkov's gonna be here. - Listen to me. I had to find a driver. I had to spend the night. Listen, get this son of a bitch out. Come on guys, Volkov's coming. Come on, let's get him, drag him out now. Let's go. Get him out, I want him out now. Come on, get him out. Come on, let's go. Hey rookie, close the door. Let's go, come on. I don't need time for this, you're new. Come on, let's go. Come on. - Operational Command, this is Red Team Leader. We are on site. - Copy, Bishop. I'm logging onto the network now. Standby. - Welcome to the Fugitive Recovery Agency. - Hello, Rook. - Hello, Agent Rae. Please enter your credentials to proceed to the agency network. - Link satellites to Agent Bishop, please. - Comm link successful. Satellite is showing all targets on site. - Bishop, you have the green light. Volkov and Brutus just entered the building. Proceed to the objective rally point and hold for further instructions. - Roger that, we're good to go. - He awakens from the nightmare only to find it a pleasant dream compared to the horrors that await him. Are you familiar with those words? They were written by a Russian scholar who lived during the Second World War. This is a man that understood the definition of pain, the definition of suffering. I find his work stimulating. I do apologize, we have not been formally introduced. Agent Shepherd, I am Andre Volkov. - Well, now we know each other. Congratulations. - You are a family man, Agent Shepherd. I understand you have a young wife, a daughter, and a brother. - So, now we're at threats, huh? - Family can be complicated, no? I had a mother. She would dance. She would sing beautiful songs. She was always there to comfort me. I had a father who adored her, yet hated her. He hated both of us depending on how much he had to drink that day. My father wanted me to be strong, show no weakness. But being a frail young boy, I often disappointed him. We moved to America seeking a new life. Lack of work only made my father's drinking worse. It was feeding the beast inside of him. Arguments continued. This day would be her last. Never can true reconcilement grow where wounds of deadly hate have pierced so deep. The devil's finest trick is to persuade you that he does not exist. We are each our own devil. And my father made his world our hell. My thoughts, my everything all being washed away by his hands, by his actions. I was left with the mark of the beast. This was a day I will never forget. Weeks after my mothers burial, life went on. But I would never be the same. I was a hollow shell, I was nothing, I was alone. Sweet soul, momma. I will honor you. Walk the universe and know peace. My dear wolf. May your soul never again know pain. I wanted my father to know the pain that I felt. I wanted him to feel it over and over and over. I waited and listened for his last breath. At that moment I was free, I was reborn. Honesty is of God, and dishonesty of the devil. The devil was a liar from the beginning, - All targets are green and ready for intercept. Bishop, prepare your team then remove London from the perch and proceed to the objective rally point. - Roger that. Contact acquired, he's got religion. Give me the word and I'll send him to his maker. - Copy that, you are clear to engage. - Agent Shepard, we are predators in a world of prey. And although we are destined to clash against one another, strength must be respected. Loyalty and integrity must be admired. I fucking hate weakness. My father in the end, he was weak. His lessons burned into my soul and left me with a mark to remember him by. And although he took my sight, Agent Shepard, I can see clearly now. - You are one ugly motherfucker. Loyalty and integrity, huh? A gang of murderers and international criminals? You buy people and appeal to their worst parts to gain control. You're kidding yourselves. - Brutus wait, he is right. There are those among us that are not worthy. - Brutus, you forgot something. - Ah, thank you me boy, I see you met Daisy. - Yeah. - What the fuck? - Do you see this pathetic man? He sold you out for temporary security, safety, and money. When my boys brought him to me, he fucking begged, pleaded, and groveled. I used him, yes. He is not a man like you and I. He is weak. - We had a fucking deal. - Agent Shepard, there is no room for weakness here. Brutus, lullaby this motherfucker. - Don't do it! - No. - Kiss him goodbye. - You sick fucking piece of shit. You're a fucking psychopath. A goddamn psychopath. - I am a killer amongst killers, yes. But we both know why you are here. - I have something of yours. And you, you have my brother, don't you? - Indeed, and now the game is set. Your brother took a small wooden box from me. - A box, with personal items, contacts? - Property I will have returned to me. - Let me guess, in exchange for my brother? You know I can't do that. However, maybe we can make a deal. - Agent Shepard, you insult me, and after my boy's gracious treatment and these luxurious accommodations. I don't make deals, but I'll tell you what. I'll return your brother to you to show you that I mean business. He stole from me, but Brutus was one step ahead. - Oh Jesus fuck. Oh Jesus Fuck. - Hello, hello. - Jesus fuck. Jesus fuckin' Christ. I gave word but they're twistin' all the words. You goddamn motherfuckers. - That's your deal. - Agent Shepard, did you know the contents of that box contained a small crucifix? All I had left from my mother. I don't make deals, Agent Shepard, but I will offer you this. I will offer you the life of your wife and daughter for my property. What you care about most for what I value most. - Do you really think you will get anywhere near them? - Agent Shepard, I am a man of action. - Hey boss, we have a plane to catch. Let's get the fuck out of here. - Agent Shepard, you have been a worthy opponent. Tell me, how long until our guests arrive? - Any moment, man, its over. - You believe this is how it ends? - There's no way out, I will find you. - Then I will see you in hell. - Move in Bishop, I'm not sure Shepard has much time left. I've been hunting you too long, Volkov. When I was a child, you took my father and his best friend Bruce from me as we left that comic book store. My father will never come back and Bruce doesn't remember a thing. Bruce, Brutus, whatever the hell you're calling him now. Those special moments before your evil entered our lives will remain with me forever. - All right, everyone say cheese. - Cheese. - All right, that's a good one. - Hey, Daisy. - Yeah, Uncle Bruce? - I notice you eyeballing that comic over there. - Yeah, it's about a cop, just like my dad. - Yeah, your dad is a great cop. You know what, you're more like him every day. Since I'm your uncle, I'm going to do you a little favor. A gift from me to you. It's yours, I'll pay for it. - Thank you so much. - No problem, anytime sweetie. Come on, let's go pay for it. - Okay. - Oh fuck. - Is he okay? - I think he's going to pull through, sir. - Command, this is Red Team Leader. Objective B secured. Volkov's not here, he's in the wind. - Rook. - Yes, Agent Rae? - Initiate the alternate sequence and upload those plans to Bishop immediately. - Alternative sequence initiated. - You can only run so far, Volkov. This is Agent Daisy Rae signing off the network.
