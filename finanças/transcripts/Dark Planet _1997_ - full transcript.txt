I need somebody with brains and loyalty. Maybe I'm old-fashioned, but I still believe in intuition. >> Can we really trust the Alphas? >> We have no choice. We've negotiated as many precautions as time allowed. The Stellar is a Rebel-built ship produced with Mercedes. It's fully automated and has three backup systems which shouldn't give you any problems. You will share equal rank with Alpha Commander Winter. Each of you will choose two crew personnel. Rank and job description is up to you. >> I'd like to take Lieutenant Byron with me. >> Is he tough? >> Yes, sir, and very creative. >> I'll take care of him.

This is our objective-- Wormhole 762. A high inertia black hole in the Tanazaki system. Three years ago, an Alpha force attempted to navigate 731, a Wormhole of less gravitational mass. >> We weren't briefed on this. >> It was to be a top secret military option. Disappear down the hole and avoid pursuit. Or hide a fleet on the other side and burst through with a surprise attack. >> It's of no importance. >> Because the mission failed. The ship was crushed before it even reached the midpoint of the hole. >> As I said, it's of no consequence. >> Reinforced ships and Class-A computers won't do the job. In the hole, it's the intangibles that come into play. >> Such as? >> The feel of the ship when you're in the hole. The navigator's moves before there's a problem. Neural computers are reactive, defensive. They can spot what's wrong and try and correct it, but by then it's too late. The hole is one big ride. You have to go along with that ride and trust your instincts to get you through. >> You're juggling a lot of unknowns, Mr. Hawke. >> I've studied the Seylla. I've flown her. She reacts well. She reacts well. >> That's not what she meant. >> That's not what she meant. >> I've looked at your medical reports. >> An Alpha medical report. I've seen it. They think I'm nuts. >> Are you? >> Are you? Are you nuts, Mr. Hawke? Are you nuts, Mr. Hawke? >> I lost a crewmember flying the hole. She was my wife. There hasn't been an hour in the past five years I haven't thought about it. >> You've resisted all >> You've resisted all behavioral reconditioning. behavioral reconditioning. >> You mean a brain wipe?

I remember going in, I remember going in, but I don't remember coming out. but I don't remember coming out. >> This is our objective. It was long suspected from the gravitational pull within the Wormhole that there was a star in close orbit, with a planet. This has now been confirmed. Mr. Hawke's Nav-computer recorded the sphere. >> Shields are crumbling. >> In fact he used it to slingshot around it for his return. Data retrieved from probes indicate that this world is inhabitable. If it is, it will be the first planet ever discovered capable of sustaining life outside of a controlled environment. So, this mission boils down to two basic questions. Can the Dark Planet be reached? And can its environment And can its environment sustain human life? sustain human life? Have you have anything to add? >> Only that my crewmen and I will carry out our duties in good faith. And I trust that you and your crew will do the same. >> Our superiors negotiated the peace for this purpose, Commander. I think it's time for us to put our suspicions aside. >> Agreed. I saw that Beta holds are restricted. I'll need access to all areas of the ship. >> I'm afraid that when the drive was engaged, we suffered serious MDM leakage. The Beta holds are contaminated, and as you know, they cannot be purged while in flight. Oh, I have the duty to report a casualty among my crew. >> You lost one of your two crewmen? >> Yes. He was our physician. >> Have you asked Command for a replacement? >> No. Unless you object, I didn't think it was necessary. There's still your doctor aboard. >> I'll have to verify this event. this event. >> As expected. >> As expected. >> Where was this man precisely? >> Beta hold, Corridor B-5. >> Beta hold, Corridor B-5. >> How did it occur? >> How did it occur? >> I was completing the flight list. I powered down the drives and had reengaged them when the event occurred. The ship's backup systems contained the leak to Section B-5. >> It's MDM poisoning, Commander, no doubt about it. Once he inhaled the gas, his whole system seized. He had probably less than 15 seconds to live. >> Then you're verifying the Alpha report? >> Yes, Commander. >> I'd like to study the event in the ship's mem-banks. >> Of course. Now if I have allayed all your fears, I would like to return to my report. Salera, freeze the body for autopsy on our return to Command. Also we shall need new computations of ship's stores. >> Sir? >> With reference to our >> With reference to our diminished crew. diminished crew. >> Commander, are you familiar with the bead game Samadhi? >> Yes, it's a game of art and spirit. >> We have six hours until we reach the perimeter. I loaded the game on the computer. I thought we may get to know each other, have some fun. >> I have no intention of playing games with you, of playing games with you, Mr. Hawke. Mr. Hawke.

You didn't achieve your distinction without getting blood on your hands, did you? On your last mission, you were inserted behind enemy lines and disappeared. Why did you desert your command, Mr. Hawke? >> I didn't like who I'd become. Like I said, robots don't make good human beings. >> You've had luxuries most of us can't afford. You were born without disease and lucky enough not to carry any recessives, either. I was a Freakie Birth. Children born like me were thrown in the garbage pile, alive. My parents begged a Rebel squad to take me. a Rebel squad to take me. I owe them my life. I owe them my life. Now it all makes sense. >> What is it? >> A Benedict. It's deployed like a satellite, then it jams telemetry on the narrow bands. They're not that sophisticated against new navigation systems. >> Unless you were forced to come in on a very narrow trajectory. >> Like entering a Wormhole. >> With this in orbit, Winter will control access to the hole. >> And the Dark Planet. >> What is so important about >> What is so important about the Dark Planet? the Dark Planet? Still can't trust me? >> This is a black-out mission, Mr. Hawke. Strictly "need to know." Are you with me or not? >> Let's go. >> Find Byron. He'll know what to do. I'll get back to the bridge and determine whether to seize the ship before or after you get us through the hole. >> Be careful around Salera. She's a telepath. >> How do you know? >> I asked. >> She's very beautiful. >> So are you, Liz. I'll see you on the bridge. >> [ weapon fired, thud ] >> [ weapon fired, thud ] [ weapon fired ] [ weapon fired ] >> Commander Winter? >> This is Winter.

[ sighs ] I don't have the luxury of developing a conscience right now, Mr. Hawke. One of you will talk. >> What makes you think you can trust me to get us through the hole? >> I don't trust you. That's why we'll navigate it together. We're 30 minutes from the perimeter. Check the coordinates with Salera. with Salera. >> [ door opens, closes ] >> [ door opens, closes ] >> I support my captain's actions, Mr. Hawke. >> So you didn't know? >> So you didn't know? >> I await your orders. >> I await your orders. >> Is the prisoner secure? >> Yes, sir! >> The Beta hold.

I told you we would make it. I told you we would make it. No! We gotta keep the ship perpendicular to the axis. There's a midpoint where there's no gravity. We gotta keep the ship vertical.

Such agents were designed to remain active for a short time, usually less than a few hours. This time there was a mutation, caused by interaction with biological weapons employed by the Alpha opposition. >> A viral organism was produced which is not restricted to human or even mammalian life.

He broke the truce by bringing a satellite onboard and died with his squad trying to defend it. I regret to report two casualties among my crew. >> Distressing. The mission must take precedence. >> Since your departure, the virus has killed over one billion people, one-sixth of the population. By our best estimates, we'll be able to save less than half that number. Earth eventually will not be able to sustain those who stay behind. >> As a result, an uninfected military contingent, comprised of both Alpha and Rebel forces, will be sent to you to begin recolonizing survivors on the Dark Planet as soon as possible. This undertaking is nothing less than starting up a whole new world from scratch. Class systems, population distribution as to age, genetic background, military-- >> No! >> Hawke? >> They're sending a war machine, Liz. A system oriented more towards death than life. They've already destroyed one world. They're capable of destroying this one as well. >> What are you saying? >> I don't know. But maybe it's time to see what being human really can mean. The Benedict is operational. A legacy of your own deceit. I know Winter was not acting alone. We have the chance to make this planet the haven it should be, free of your politics and your war. >> You're being naive, Hawke. You'll never get away with this. >> Oh, I think he will, Harry. >> I have two intelligent, dedicated and beautiful women with me. They represent the best that both worlds have to offer. Between us, the Benedict, and the Wormhole, we can stop you. The survivors will come in peace, in partnership, and in friendship... or they won't come at all. >> And so? >> And so finally, >> And so finally, the war is over. the war is over.
