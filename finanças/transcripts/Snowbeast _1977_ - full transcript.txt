[wind blowing] [music playing] [roaring] [music playing] [shouting] Oh, come on. Let's go. Hey, Jennifer, let's go back. But why? It's gorgeous skiing. Because there's something funny. Oh, come on. [music playing] [sigh] [music playing] Hey, Jennifer, look at these. [scoffs] Some joker. Snowshoes from some mail order novelty house. [roaring] [music playing] [screaming] [band music playing] MRS. RILL [ON LOUDSPEAKER]: Hello everyone. I'm Mrs. Carrie Rill, as you probably know. And I'd like to welcome all of you to the Rill Lodge, and our 50th Annual Rill Carnival. All of us here have been looking forward to this big event for some time. Even the weather has left us with good snow and cold, sunny skies. I'm sure you'll agree that the events that we have lined up will make this our best Winter Carnival yet. Let me tell you a little about what we have planned. First of all, you may compete in as many of the events as you've a mind to. We've got cross-country skiing, snowmobiling, dog sled racing, and every variety of alpine skiing. [cheering] Downhill, slalom, and freestyle skiing. [cheering] It's what we used to call hot-dogging. [laughter] But, uh, you hot-doggers will be judged on grace and originality, not on your audacity. [cheering] First of the show, the Snow Queen. Thank you! CROWD: Thank you! Mrs. Rill, hi, how are you? Hail, to the queen. CROWD: Hail! Charlie. Is Mr. Rill in? Can I help you, Buster? Come on, Charlie. No. Uh, Tony? Could you come out here a second? Buster Smith wants to talk to you. Hi, Buster. What can I do for you? Mr. Rill, can I I talk to you to you a moment... in private? Sure. I am so pleased you remembered, Betty Jo... even though your mother's too young to remember... that I was the very first queen of our very first Winter Carnival. But I was only 16. That was, uh, 50 years ago. Tell her I'll be right there. CARRIE: Tony! It's a fine time to be going skiing. Oh, hardly, Grandma... we have a little problem. The manager takes care of big problems, which we don't have at Rill Lodge. No. No big problems here, Grandma. He thinks because he's my grandson, he can treat me as if I were his grandmother. [laughter] [snowmobile driving] Heidi? Heidi, can you explain to me exactly where... You won't believe me, either. Nobody will ever believe me. Well, what's more important... finding your friend, or trying to convince us that there's some kind of monster out there. There is. I saw its footprints. I heard it. And it's got Jennifer. And all anybody's doing around here is staring at me like I'm crazy. Nobody thinks you're crazy. The problem is the patrolmen haven't been able to find Jennifer yet. In fact, they can't even find your tracks. You're going to have to get ahold of yourself and take us back out there again, and... I'm not going back. Please, don't ask me to. Please. I can't. OK. OK. But you can describe the spot, can't you? No. The only thing I can remember is those footprints. [shivers] Cold. I'm scared, [inaudible]. What am I going to tell Jennifer's parents? They always expect me to keep an eye on her. I'm going to call them right now. No, no, no. Don't worry them unnecessarily like that. We're going to find Jennifer, I promise you. Let's get back to the lodge, and get yourself warmed up. I'll have Buster drive you down. Hey, try not to worry, OK? We're going to find her, I'm telling you. HEIDI: Tony? We passed an old barn, off by itself near a stream. Good girl. Take her down to the lodge, have my grandmother keep an eye on her. I'd hate to have our guests or anybody at carnival hear that kind of story... from any of us, huh? Let's split up, see what we can find, and we'll meet back at the lodge in a half hour. Let's go. [music playing] [SHOUTING] Jennifer! [music playing] [roaring] Can we have your autograph, Mr. Seberg? You gave my father one at the '68 Winter Olympics. But then when you won that gold medal, he sold it. He did? [laughing] -What did he get for it? -Don't tell him. Let him keep his illusions. Thank you. Will you be staying for the whole winter carnival? I think so. That's just great. Well, thank you. [sighing] Well, it's nice to feel wanted somewhere. Coming? Hi, Tony. Hey, Tony! I don't think he recognized us. I think he did. Perhaps he's got something more important to do right now. Nope. Good old Tony knows I'm going to ask him for a job. How could he know that? He hasn't heard from you in ages. Ellen, you were right. Coming up here was a dumb idea. I never said it was a dumb idea. I just said you might be better off looking for work outside the ski business. This is all I know how to do. Know what I think, Gar? You don't really want a job. This is just another excuse to back out and still feel right about it. This wasn't an animal. And it wasn't human, either. Well that certainly narrows it down. Did the other men see it? I don't think so. You didn't ask them? If they'd had seen, they'd have told me. They thought Heidi was imagining things. They couldn't possibly think that of you. One word from you, it'd be all over town in a minute. Well, it's a fine time to have a panic... just before our Winter Carnival. I'm not hiding anything. I didn't tell the men because I wanted to get them out of the area as quick as I could. Not because you have a vested interest in the future of this resort. Grandma, I'm going to try to spell it out for you very simple. There's something very strange and very dangerous out there. And if I thought it would stay up there, fine. We could designate the area avalanche-prone and just seal it off. Well, if it were going to come any nearer, wouldn't it have done so by now? What do you base that on? You don't know anything about it. I mean, you don't know how long it's been up there, when it got there. It could have got there last night. Just in time for the Winter Carnival. What are you being so facetious about? For heaven's sake. What do you want us to do? Report it to Sheriff Paraday immediately. Report what to Sheriff Paraday? Can you hear yourself describing what you saw... what you thought you saw? Tony, we need this carnival. It's what keeps the tourists coming here all year round. The town needs it. I know all that. Well then, let's just hold our fire until the carnival is over. I agree with you, let's designate the area restricted. Tell the maintenance crew to put up a slew of signs. And what do you tell Jennifer's parents? Tony, I... I'm not being insensitive, just realistic. You know what I think? I think it was an avalanche. Bodies do disappear in avalanches, you know. Are you forgetting about Heidi? I'm... I'm not worried about Heidi. And I certainly don't have to worry about you, Tony, do I? After all, you are my grandson. Charlie, see if you can locate Sheriff Paraday for me. Oh, all right. Gar, Ellen. Sorry I had to keep running, uh, a crisis to take care of. You two look great! Does he, uh, still wear his gold medal to bed? [laughter] Listen, I'm still running. Let's get together, have a drink later on, and confess everything. And I'd forgotten how beautiful you are. You always were the winner. I need a job, Tony. Not anymore, you don't [music playing] Mr. Rill, I heard you didn't find the girl. You want me to go... Where have you been? With Heidi? Yeah. How is she? Uh, your grandmother had the doctor give her something. Put her out for a while. She was in pretty bad shock. Look, Mr. Rill, I'm supposed to have the rest the day off, but I got a pretty good idea where that girl is up there on that mountain. If it's all right with you, I'd like to take a couple of patrollers up there, look around and see what I can find. No, and that's an order. May I ask why? Because I don't want anybody up there. I want the area posted. You get ahold of Ben Cochran in maintenance, you tell him to get ready to put a lot of signs up there. Yes sir. Saying what? What? How do you want the signs to read? Restricted area. [music playing] [roaring] [music playing] [grunting] [music playing] [roaring] [music playing] John, where you going? [roaring] [music playing] [growling] What's the matter, son? What's the matter? Speak up! Inside. The water trough. [music playing] Oh. Oh my. Oh. [gagging] [band music playing] Hey, Tony. Sheriff, I want to talk to you. SHERIFF: Sure! OK, Hold on. I'll be right there. [band music playing] VOICE ON RADIO: Unit Two calling Unit One. Unit Two calling Unit One. Unit Two. Go ahead. VOICE ON RADIO: Sheriff, some ski patroller wants to talk to you. Yeah, what about? VOICE ON RADIO: The man said murder. What? Where? VOICE ON RADIO: Out at the old Fairchild place. SHERIFF: I'm on my way. Tony! It's gonna have to wait. Wait a minute! [siren wailing] Sorry I'm late. How's our own superstar? Your grandmother decided that a living legend is just what this place needs. Hm. Uh, may I have some coffee, please? Would you like some more tea, Mrs. Seberg? Yes, thank you, Mr. Rill. Tea. [sighs] What is it, Tony? Uh, pressures. Comes with, uh... Inheriting all this. Mm. I must tell you, I'm very impressed. You've really built this into something. Why, thank you. Thank you... for giving Gar a job. That's all in our favor. But he told me he had a hard time getting you up here. How come? Well, I only get two weeks off a year, you know. And I had my heart set on a warm climate. Mm. And I... I was afraid of seeing you again, after all this time... everything we had. What did you think would happen? I don't know. I've been having a lot of fantasies about you for the last year. Fantasies about me? Good or bad? Not bad. A friend of mine, a doctor, said that, uh, when a woman starts having fantasies about the man she didn't marry, she's not getting enough realities from the man she did. Hm. I think your friend is talking to you about sexual realities, and you're not. Reality is the problem. You know, Tony, if I were an archaeologist or something, it wouldn't be so bad. But I'm a reporter. Television is all here and now. It's exciting, it's challenging, it's stimulating. That's where I am all day, then I go home to Gar. And it's the winter of '68. That's where he is. How long has it been like that? Do you know that he hasn't been up on his skis since he won the gold medals? That's incredible. But, maybe coming up here will change all that. Not his fault entirely. 25% of the world watched him win those medals. The president called him. He was on magazine covers. He did television commercials. He was a hero for an instant. And whatever it takes to go back to being an ordinary mortal, Gar doesn't have it. It's... It's really a form of paralysis. Well, as I see the problem, doctor, you're still in love with the man. If I could fall out of love with him, it'd be so much easier. You know, marriage can survive a lot of things. But it can't survive lack of respect. And I've lost about all the respect I ever had for him. I need a nap. Wait a minute. You know what you need? You need to have someone say he loves you. And I do, you know. I always have. [music playing] [sighs] I saw that, you know. Kissing my wife in public. Hey, um... Guess who's been elected to crown Queen Betty Jo? Yours truly. Ta-da. Gar, are you still a good marksman? You mean on the rifle range? No, not necessarily. [laughing] What do you mean? OK, whatever I tell you, you're going to have to promise me not to repeat it to anybody. OK. You're serious, aren't you? Mm-hm. Not even Ellen? Especially Ellen. Why especially Ellen? Because she's a news person. OK. MRS. RILL: Tony. Meet me in an hour at the swimming pool, OK? OK. You better take the boy home now, Mr. Cochran. I appreciate your help. Yeah, OK. Sure. Thanks, son. [music playing] [splash] There's something that's troubling you, Tony. Why don't you tell me what it is? You remember a news story a few months back, uh, some hikers claimed that one of their party... a young girl... was carried off by a 12-foot hairy monster? Yeah, Bigfoot. Do you believe in such a creature? I really don't know. But you know, they say that there are hundreds of 'em, roaming around all over the country. Who says? GAR: Lots of people Right after that story broke, Ellen did a special on the Bigfoot controversy. So she traveled all over the country. Interviewed dozens of people who supposedly had seen one of them. Has one of them been seen around here? Is that what your crisis is all about? Well, I saw something, Gar. It was monstrous. And it wasn't an animal. It wasn't human, either. [laughing] And now you find that you're too rational and too realistic to allow yourself to believe it was something else. Is that it? Um, a little bit of all of it. And that's why you hired me to go out and blow its brains out, right? Talk about friendship. You're really something else. TONY: I didn't give you a job as a hired killer, Gar. Of course not. You were only thinking of this town that you love so very much. You're damn right I am. That thing is dangerous, Gar. Hey, just because it doesn't look like you and me makes it a thing. And then it's all right to go out and kill it in cold blood, right? And how do you know it's dangerous? Everyone who's ever been in contact with one says exactly the same thing. It stares at you for a few seconds, and then it disappears again into the wilderness. Except when it feels like carrying off a young girl. That story turned out to be a hoax. I'm not talking about this story. I'm talking about one of our guests. I found her jacket the other day. It looked like it had been ripped off her body, and it was bloodstained. And I believe that thing killed her. Have you seen my husband? No, Ellen, I haven't. [snowmobile driving] Jimmy, are you looking for me? No. Sheriff Paraday needs to see Tony right away. You have any idea where he might be? No, I haven't. Well, Ellen, it seems as if both our men are missing. Something wrong? Nothing you want to hear about. And look, I got to get right back out there. As soon as he shows up, will you tell him the Sheriff wants him to come right out to the old Fairchild farm? [snowmobile driving] [music playing] Sheriff, I went off to the Rill lodge. They don't know where Tony is. I talked to Mrs. Rill. Told her as soon as he shows up, send him out here right away. OK. You make anything of this? [music playing] Yeah, [inaudible]. [music playing] [snowmobiles driving] Hey, Tony! I thought I saw something up there. Where? Come on, we got to get to the barn. The Sheriff's waiting for us. [music playing] Hi, Cole. I got here as fast as I could. This is Gar Seberg, our new ski school director. Sheriff Paraday. What's up? Well, I think we found that missing girl. Where? Cochran's boy had found her inside, dead. I understand she was a guest at the lodge. I was hoping you could help me identify her. [sighs] I must have seen her somewhere. Maybe I'll recognize her when I see her face. She doesn't have one. [music playing] It's pretty obvious she wasn't murdered. Only human beings commit murder, and whatever did that wasn't even halfway human. What do you think, Tony? Can you help me? Is that her? That's her. What do you base that on? Color of her suit. How would you know the color of her clothes? TONY: It matches the jacket I found. You found the jacket? Where? On the north slope. We were looking for her up there yesterday. Her friend thought she might have had an accident. So the patrollers told me, but they didn't say anything about a jacket. We spread out in different directions, Cole. But you came together again. That's right. So why didn't you show them the jacket? What? Why didn't you show them the jacket, Tony? I left it where I found it, as a marker. Is that what you wanted to talk to me about? [sighs] That's right. I wanted to see you about it first. I didn't want to put the town in a panic. And what about this stuff, uh, Heidi told the patrol about a monster? Heidi only saw the footprints. I saw the thing itself. All right. Tell me about it. [breathing heavily] [music playing] [roaring] [music playing] [roaring] Well, I can certainly understand your grandmother not wanting any of this to get out. You know, she may be right about it being a grizzly. Winter attacks are not all that rare, you know. Cole, it's not a grizzly. What do you think it is? Gar thinks it's one of those legendary creatures called Bigfoot. That's right. The legends I've heard about Bigfoot put him pretty firmly in the Pacific Northwest. Not necessarily, Sheriff. Ellen tells me that there are hundreds of them roaming around all over the country. Ellen? Oh, my wife. She's a TV journalist, and a while back she did a special on the Bigfoot controversy. Did they settle anything? No. Not what you, a Sheriff, would consider hard evidence. But she did run across a couple of interesting points. She went up to Washington state and met with an anthropologist. He showed her... well, I think she said... 150 photographs, hand and foot prints of so-called Bigfoots. Now, if you want to know more about it, I suggest you go and talk to Ellen. [music playing] [roaring] Whatever did that to that girl, the less people would get in its way, the more of us are going to stay alive. Right. So we're going to say that the girl was mauled to death by a crazed grizzly out of hibernation. That's the story I'd like for you to tell your wife, Mr. Seberg. All right, Sheriff, I will. For now, that is. Thank you. Tomorrow morning, when it gets daylight, I'd like for the three of us to sneak out here, track that thing down, and kill it. We just lost Mr. Seberg. No you didn't, Sheriff. Whatever did that to that girl in there, has got to be destroyed. Fine. OK. [music playing] [roaring] she wasn't even twenty to think that something like that could happened to her killed by a bear... and in the dead of winter... C'mon you can't believe that something else happened ... I'm scared where had you been? we've been calling all other town for you what's wrong? you were supposed to be at the high school an hour ago. Tony, would you go the the airport? I had to notify her parents they due in any minute What you told them grandma? nothing... except that ... you'll be there to meet them C'mon [band music playing] Hi girls. [interposing voices] Hi, Betty Jo. Oh, Betty Jo, smile. I'm trying to smile -but I keep imagining how that poor... -Betty Jo. it's carnaval time and you're the queen. Oh my God! [roaring] [screaming] [car horn honking] [roaring] [screaming] Gar. Are you all right? Gar, Gar, did you see it? Did you see it? [screaming] The crown. The crown. [crack] [screaming] mother Mother! [SCREAM] What a mess. How we gonna write this one up? I don't know. Gar. What? Please tell Tony I'm sorry. He was right. I should have let him report it. But we had to have our Winter Carnival. It was our 50th. I guarantee you, it'll continue for the next 50 years. Now you take care of yourself, all right? In there. I'll take care of this for you. Thank you. Take care. [siren wailing] still can't get a hold of Tony there is a lot of hysteria bad news travels fast let me drive you back don't worry about the car, I have one of my deputies... ... to take care of it. your wife is probably worry about you you picked a bad time to work around here. yep what are you going to do next? as soon as is day time I'll get there and see if I can track that thing down I'd like to come along... if you don't mind Well, Tony said you are a crackshot sure.. by the way... did you teach your wife... ... to sky like that? like what? when have you even seen her skying? she followed us, I saw her from the hills watching us I guess she turned around and headed back I wonder how she found out there was something going on I wonder the same thing until I found out she was a reporter My deputy figures she over-hear him asking for Tony I guess something in the way he said it must pick her interest anyway... let's hope that by this time tomorrow night we'll have an end of the story for her hey, Billy how are you? have you seen my wife? no since this afternoon wait.. excuse me Mr Seavers I got to check that couple out. or they'll walk out without paying you saw my wife this afternoon.. did you see her come back? no [music playing] Ah! Ah! Oh! Oh! Ah! That was so terrifying. Oh! Thank God. You know, you scared the hello out of me. [laughter] Oh. Gar? Yeah? I'm proud of you. I'm sorry I let us drift so far apart. Well, we both kind of let that happen. I should have been there when you needed me all these years. Yeah. You finally were. I was? Sure. If you hadn't gotten lost, I would never have had a good enough reason to get back on those skis again. I wasn't. I stood on top of this mountain, and looked down. And I saw myself instead of flying down, I was falling down... completely out of control. But once I got skiing, it was great. It was really great, Ellen. I should have told you a long time ago why I never skied after '68. I think it's because I saw too many champions become has-beens. I didn't want to be a has-been. So, I figured by not skiing any more, I'd stay on top. But I didn't. Of course, things don't happen that way. They don't. I've been such a fool, Ellen. Oh, not a fool, my love. We're all afraid of failing. No. Not you. Oh yes, me. I never knew that. I never showed you. Have you been keeping things from me? No. Will you kiss me? I thought you'd never ask. Come here. [music playing] [helicopter flying] HELICOPTER PILOT [ON RADIO]: This is Bud, Sheriff. We've checked the north slope for Mr. and Mrs. Seberg. No sign of anyone or anything in this area. [helicopter flying] [music playing] I love you. Did you say something? [growling] Let's go home, Gar. Do we have to? Come on. [growling] Are you sure you want to go home? [screaming] [roaring] Come on! [glass breaks] Come on. Come on. [roaring] [straining] I'm gonna check the barn, Cole. Tony? Wait a minute. Up there on the hill. It's gone, but I saw it. I swear. We're gonna have to go back over the bridge and turn around to get over there. Wait! Wait, Tony! Wait! God. Tony! Oh, please. Oh. You OK? We're all right. The sheriff and the deputy are up there looking for it right now. [music playing] And so, we have gathered to pay our last respects. We pray that [inaudible] Smith, as well as the rest of us here today. Let us all pause for a moment of reflection, and silent homage to Buster Smith. [music playing] Ready. Aim. Fire. [gun shots] [music playing] Hey, I told the sheriff I was going to catch up with him. Uh, I guess you two better get some sleep, huh? No. I'll go with you. After the night you've been through? Sure. If I'm asleep when you come in, wake me up. DEPUTY: [SHOUTING] We got him! The sheriff himself shot it, right between the eyes. We're bringing it in. [cheering] Right. Over here. [interposing voices] I couldn't believe one of those things would be out in the winter time. Yeah, I'm amazed. That was some shot, huh? [interposing voices] [music playing] Hello, it's the Segers, huh? How are things at the lodge? OK. Do you mind if I ask you a yes or no question? That all depends. As a friend? ...[inaudible] More as a time saver, though. Because if your answer is yes, there's no sense in us talking. Did you know you were killing the wrong thing? All I know for sure, Mr. Seberg, is that, uh, something came charging out of that brush at me, and it wasn't you. Are you that sure that it was the wrong thing? Well, I don't know. But it seems to me that the best way to find out is to cut it open and see what's inside. Look, Sheriff. If the people of this town are in danger. Don't you think it's your responsibility to warn them? Even if it means calling off the Winter Carnival? Look, Mrs. Seberg, uh, what is it that I'm going to warn the people against? A man-beast, a legend, who's very existence is hotly disputed? Disputed by whom? Well, by the US Army Corps of Engineers, for one. I wouldn't know this, but I talk to Washington this morning. They said that they don't have one piece of evidence... nothing they've seen or heard... that would stand up under scientific scrutiny, unquote. Now, is that what you want me to warn the people against? You honestly expect them to believe it? Now, an unseasonal bear is one thing. But a legend is, uh, well, just that... a legend. Bigfoot has been sighted in the northwest for the last 150 years. There are verified recordings of attacks. I heard a man on my television show just recently who swears they threw a rock at one, and it ran away. But I don't think what we're seeing is Bigfoot. I don't think it's as simple as that. I agree. There have been enough happenings around here. All it takes is one person who doesn't believe it was a bear, and you'll have a stampede on your hands. That's just the point. I don't want these hills full of people shooting at each other. Now you don't believe it was that bear, do you? No, it was not a bear. What do you think it was? I don't know. A mutant of some kind, something left over from the last ice age. I don't know. Whatever it is, it's still out there. And it's a killer. What do you suggest we do? What you told my husband we should do in the first place. But this time, let's really do it. That's right. And you can count on me, Sheriff. What you're saying is you, uh, want us to go up there... just the two of us... and destroy this thing. That's right. Just the three of us. Just the four of us. Everybody ready? [music playing] [snowmobiles driving] [music playing] [snowmobiles driving] [growling] [music playing] [growling] [music playing] [growling] [music playing] Cole, I think we should call it a day and get back to the camper. [growling] [music playing] [roaring] [growling] [snowmobiles driving] TONY: Well, he knows where we're at. Maybe we ought to move camp. No, we're going to stay right here. Settle down and wait for him. Isn't that better than cruising around on the off chance that we might sight him? He's got a point. Well, we'll have to keep watch all night. ELLEN: Two at a time. I said the four of us, didn't I? You did. Look, you two go first. I'll make dinner. Tony? OK. Would you hold these things? [music playing] TONY: They're bluer, you know? What are? Your eyes. [laughs] Can I ask you a question that's been following me around for a long time? Yeah. Why did you decide against me? I didn't decide against you, Tony. I decided for Gar. I loved you both, you know. But he needed me. And I didn't? But it's OK, Ellen. You've just answered an eight-year-old question. Friends? Friends. Always. [music playing] Our watch, gentlemen. I made some dinner. It's on the table for you. All right. Sounds great. [music playing] [growling] [music playing] Good morning. [growling] [roaring] [logs clattering] [SHOUTING] Cole! Cole. Cole. Are you hurt? Oh my God! Come on, Gar. Tony. Tony! [inaudible] Cole! [roaring] [screaming] [music playing] Let's slow down. It's not safe for us anymore. It got what it wanted. Well, he's no longer killing just to eat. That last attack wasn't mindless. That was a planned counterattack. We're not going to get very far walking. The barn's down here. Let's head for it. Hey, Tony... that's not a very good idea. Why not? Because that's where he's been stashing his food. Can you imagine us being there when he shows up? It's already lost two from there. If he's as smart as you think he is, he won't come back to the barn again. Let's go. [music playing] [growling] [music playing] Hey Tony, where you going? There's three sets of skis and three rifles back up at that camper. Why don't you stay with Ellen? There's no sense in all of us risking our lives. Oh no. We decided we would stay together until this thing was over, remember? We're more vulnerable if we split up. OK. Let's go. [music playing] This new snow is just going to make everything more difficult for us. Yeah, but a lot easier for it. Come on, baby. [music playing] Wait a second. Where will you have access when a camper turned over? On the side of it. The extra rifles were inside, weren't they? Yeah. Now, if I pull the logs out, will you go in again? Yeah, I'll get in. Tony. Yeah. [music playing] GAR: Ellen, do you see the rifles? No. Well, can you find anything? There's some skis. Oh great, throw them out. Hey, there should be a service revolver in the cab. Ellen, look in the closet... the rifles might be there. All right. [music playing] [SHOUTING] Tony! Look! I found the gun! GAR: Well, use it! [gun shot] [roaring] Tony, [inaudible]! [gun shot] [roaring] Gar, finish it. [music playing] Get the rifles, Ellen, and the other skis. OK. [music playing] [growling] [music playing] [gun clicking] [music playing] [growling] [music playing] [roaring] [gunshots] [roaring] [screaming] [roaring] [crashing] [music playing]
