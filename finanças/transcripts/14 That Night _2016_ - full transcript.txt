AUGUST 4TH, 1987 6:37 A.M. Why on earth are you home so late? Shut up, you old bitch! Old bitch? How dare you call me that! Megumi, come back here! Newspaper? Yes. Could you get it for me? Dad was home every day during my summer vacation in my third year of junior high school. It was your fault, so stop moping around. It's awkward for me at work now too. Hey. Knock it off when Haruko comes home. Does she... -know? -About what? I wouldn't tell her! Not when her fiancé is here. Stop worrying about your image. You better be home at 6:00 p.m. Don't mess around and be late. Wash the dishes. A bit before summer vacation started, Dad hit a motorcyclist while driving. Luckily, neither of them got hurt. I'm off to my club. But Dad had alcohol in his blood and was a high school teacher, so he got suspended for a while and stayed home every day. Good morning, Taka my dear. Do you have school club? I'll leave these veggies in your kitchen. Hey. Is Tadao still depressed? Is Yoshiko bullying him? She can be so mean. At a time like this, a wife should support her husband. -When we... -After Dad got suspended, Grandma, who lived in the annex, came in everyday when Mom was out. What is she thinking? I can't understand her at all. I'm going. Bye now. Take care. Oh, Haru is coming today, isn't she? Has Yoshiko prepared anything? Hey! Takashi. Put some proper clothes on. Buy August's Pure Literature for me. Here. Why don't you buy it? I'll buy it for you. You're still submitting? That silly boy. He's not a criminal. There's no need to be ashamed. Right? He is a criminal. What? When did I start thinking of Dad as pathetic? When his novels didn't get selected and he took it out on us? When we got overtaken in my elementary school's parent-child race? Pardon me, but... When he failed the vice-principal exam yearly -despite paying bribes? -Please! Please! Anyway, at some point, I decided I didn't want to become like Dad. PURE LITERATURE NEWCOMER AWARD FIRST ROUND RESULTS Shall we? Riki Lariat! Another one? He dodges! Inoki is mad! Here comes a Knuckle Part! Another one! Here comes a Knuckle Part! Choshu is dead! Yatsu, you go. Yatsu! Yatsu gets a manji-gatame! You suck for an All Japan champ! That hurts! Will Choshu get up? Choshu is done. Come get it, you dumbass! A manji-gatame for Choshu! Yatsu! Cut it out. Choshu is finished! KYOKO YOKUSHIMARU CUP SIZE: L Are you coming? The timing is... Okay, one more time. One more time. Go back. Forget the last take. Run fast. Here we go! Don't think. Smile. Here we go! Ready, action! Hey. Don't get angry over it. I found out afterward. Afterward. Takeuchi gets too carried away. That hurt. Hey. What, they're filming again? Noda! What are you filming? What? Are they at it again? Damn it! Noda! Don't you dare make a porno! Hey. We're shooting for real. Don't ruin it. What? But, sir, you're our judo coach. I am, but... I'll look in later. Do ukemi. Or dandori. It's not dandori, it's randori! If you mess that up again, I'll give you an Antonio Special! No... No, thanks. We'll be done soon, okay? Okay? Let's go! Shush, my ass. Chrome dome! They're crazy. Is it for Action Camera? It could be. Noda has read it since elementary school. You read it too. -No, I didn't. -Yes, you did. -No, I didn't. -You did. -No, I didn't. -Don't lie. You dick. I read Scholar. But, you know, it's like they've changed since they won that award. How? Kind of... It's because of that newspaper story. Let's piledrive them at homeroom. I want to feel up Yokushimaru's tits! For real! Yokushimaru! Let me feel you up! What? Don't you guys want to? Hey, isn't today the day she comes? Oh, it is. To World. Is it today? Anyway, who said so? Isn't it just a rumor? Kyoko Koizumi was supposed to come last year but she didn't. That was obviously fake. The Hong Kong mafia was going to attack Japan too. Mitsuru said his dad got shot. Right? Hey! -Hey! -That hurts! Hey, you'll break it. Inoki and I are arm-breakers. That hurts! How about it? What? Well, do you want to stop by World after school? They might have information. You want to suck Yokushimaru's titties that much? It's not anything like that. Bullshit! It's me! Black Angels! Black Angels! BUTT-NAKED JULY EDITION World, the only video rental store in our town RENTAL SHOP WORLD would host a signing session with Kyoko Yokushimaru. KYOKO YOKUSHIMARU CUP SIZE: L But there was more to the rumor. At midnight, she would let you suck her boobs. For us bored junior high third years on vacation, it was too exciting to ignore. Hand signal, left turn! I'm going to fart! RENTAL SHOP WORLD Cut it out. You reek! That was a big one. What a stink. Edelweiss -My fart smells nice -What's going on? Hey. Shut the hell up. Shit! Search for information on Yokushimaru. Takashi and Mitsuru, go there. Okada, stay here. Okada? You scared me. There's no Yokushimaru information. The rumor's a fake? I bet there's information in there. -Mitsuru, go look. -No way. We're not allowed in there. It's okay! I'll allow you. -Go! -I can't! -Come on! Go! -No! -Go, damn it! -Hey! You're junior high kids. Go watch Be-Bop High School, morons. Come here. Come here now. Come on! Come over here and line up. Which junior high? What? I said, which junior high? Kawakita Junior High. Kawakita? What a shithole. You know that gorilla Yoshida? No. Don't say "no" to me. Hey! You little punks. I bet your foreskins aren't even rolled back yet. You want me to do it for you? What are you laughing at? Do you want me to? -What? -Hey. Yours isn't either. What? What are you laughing at? Mine rolled back the other day. What? Is that something to be proud of? Well... Here, your lunch. I asked for fried chicken. It's got one piece. -What? -What? What? -So it does. -Yes. Sure. Hey, they go to Kawakita but they don't know Yoshida. He was in your year, you dumbass. What? -Take your break. -What the hell? -I'm taking my break. -Okay. Quit standing there. Okay. Anyway, let's rent something. She's got big tits. I want to suck them. Would she let me for 500 yen? For 500 yen? What? Hey. Where's The Story of O? Who the hell rented it? It used to be here. Choose a Japanese one. No way! I hate Japanese! -You're Japanese. -Shithead! I'm American. There's The Story of O! Found it! The Story of O. Hey, you've got good taste. How many years have you been fishing? How many years? Mitsuru? -Mitsuru? -What? Get this. What? She's got hooks stuck in her. -It's okay. Well then... -Okay. Have you picked one? Ready, go! -First is rock, then scissors, then paper -First is rock, then scissors, then paper -Rock, paper, scissors -Rock, paper, scissors -One more time. -It cost us over 1,000 yen... -Draw! -to rent a video. -Draw! -So we put our money together... -Draw! -played rock, paper, scissors... -Draw! -and watched the winner's choice... -Draw! -at Mitsuru's house. -Draw! -Draw! Screw this! Let's start over from the beginning. Here we go. -First is... -First is paper Yes! I beat all three of you! Mitsuru, go pay. -I'll hold this. -What? You found 1,000 yen yesterday. It's 1,200 yen. Hey. Hey! Well, today, my dad might be home. -What? -What? What about pachinko? He's got no money this month. Bullshit! Get him out of there now! What will we do? Mitsuru's dad, an ex-truck driver, was paralyzed in an accident and just played pachinko. His mom wasn't around. -Go, damn it. -I can't! Hey, Meathead! -It's Meathead! -Hey there, Meathead! What? Bullying the weak kid? Come on, Meathead. You'll get arrested for that. You copied my hairstyle. Don't tell me you came to see Kyoko Yokushimaru. -Is that it? -You're too early! What did you rent? The Story of O! We were going to get that. It's way out of your league. Way out! I'll take care of this. What? You've got a problem? You don't, do you? Let's go! Come on. -I'm coming. -Me too. Single eyelids! Yoshioka! Laugh, damn it! It isn't funny! I can do it too! -That's sick! -Shut up! That's right! See you, Meathead. Later, Meathead. Bye, Meathead. Don't fix your hair! You better not! I... was almost ready to kick their asses. Kaneda and his guys are already having sex. Is that true? Hey. Is that true? What? Kaneda and his guys having sex. If they are, why would they have to watch The Story of O? I mean, I don't really want to watch it either. I'm beyond that. Anyway, they touch more boobs than we do. That's enough to envy them. Kaneda felt up Megumi Nishino. Isn't she going out with some bike gang guy? Is she doing it? I bet she is, 100 percent. Kaneda's guys said so. Screw it. Let's watch that bootleg video again. With the black people? Who's got it now? I do. Are you watching it every day? Like hell I am. It's creepy. And fuzzy. Maybe black porn doesn't turn me on. It sure turned me on. It's Kemeko. Rambo! I told you this is off-limits, you pig-faced grunt! Hey, you bullshitting gorilla. What are you grinning at? I'll waste you. All you talk about is money, asshole. You want to die? Then die. Retard. Scumbag. Dumbass. Shithead. Moron. Clown. Buckteeth. Mutant navel. Cockroach. Stinkweed. Will we? What? -Oh, forget it. -Spit it out. Well... Will we ever? Boobs. What about boobs? Will we ever get to feel up boobs all we want? That was random. Don't you ever worry about that? Feeling up boobs? No. I'll just do it. You worry about that? Noda has a better chance of feeling up boobs than we do. Noda from the film club? Who cares about that dork? I get the feeling he's left us behind. Left us behind how? I thought we were better than them. In every way. Better in what way? Well, I'm not really sure. As people, I guess. That's a shitty thing to say! Terminate! I mean, I can run faster. So can I. I'm more cheerful than them. So am I. They're no good at studying and they were easy to ignore until that award. So... I've been thinking. What about? Feeling up boobs? No. Kaneda's guys are delinquents, so feeling up boobs is no big deal. Takeda plays baseball. Higaki plays basketball. Popular guys like them get to feel up boobs. When Noda's guys become famous directors, they'll screw actresses. You dickhead. They won't. Unless they become Shinya Yamamoto. Shinya Yamamoto gets more girls than us. Like hell he does! I bet he does. He's famous. What? He isn't famous at all. He's more famous than us. What's your point? I don't get it. Not one bit. What I mean is, we don't have anything that makes us special. We're not delinquents, artists, or athletes. We're totally unattached. We're the type of people who are easy to ignore. Among everybody out there, we're below average. Since I started thinking that, I haven't slept well. What the hell, man? You really bummed me out. So we're like Kemeko? No, not on your life. Damn. I wish I was a natural-born delinquent too. Hey! You guys want to go see if Kyoko Yokushimaru is coming? At midnight, we might get to suck on her titties. What are you, chicken? I'm not, but... Won't Kaneda's guys be there? Dumbass. Don't be scared of them! Takashi? You're in, right? Well... -Oh, I can't. -Why? You're not going? My big sister is bringing her fiancé home tonight. -What? -I've got cram school. What the hell? Fiancés and cram school? Forget that shit! It's Yokushimaru's tits! Don't you want to suck them? I want to suck them! Mitsuru! It's just you and me. Those guys are wimps. You're both pathetic. Mitsuru's got more guts than you! Let's go. They're here, they're queer. Check out those two queers behind us. I'll go! I can ditch cram school easily. Way to go, Okada. You're a go-getter. Takashi? I'll go too. Right on! See you at school at 9:00 p.m. I better see you. No pussying out. If you do, I'll put your dicks in a manji-gatame. Got that? This is even more out of the way than I imagined. I told you there's nothing here. I wouldn't say nothing but still... Mind if we drive more? To keep our meeting short. Sorry, this is bad timing. Hey. What? Oh, it's just, that kid looked like my brother. No, it can't be my brother. He's cuter. What? I'm home. You're earlier than usual! Haruko is coming. Oh, right. What time is she coming? Around 7:00 p.m. Oh, that's right. Grandma went shopping. Yes. -What's that? -What? A video is playing. Oh, that. What? Your mom is late. What? Don't do that! You'll break it if you just yank it out! I wasn't yanking it. I'll fix it! Okay? You did yank it. BLACK WOMAN HUNTING PART 3 Tadao, I bought your magazine. Your novel wasn't chosen again? Should you drink? I'm going to anyway. Haruko is bringing what's-his-name. You're right. You've done your penance. You can drink. I will too. Tadao's blood pressure has been high lately so his doctor said no spicy food. I know that. The flavor is richer than usual. Haruko's fiancé is coming, so I changed it for him. -But everyone will eat it. -Young people like it like this. An old person will eat it too. -This is too rich. -Then eat something else. Go get your father. They'll be here soon. He'll stay out there as long as he can. Lend me a hand, why don't you? I'm busy. Hey! Mom said it's time to stop weeding. Hey, Mom said stop it. Tadao, how much longer will you be doing that? You don't have to do that now. Yes, I do. The grass has grown. Give the mosquitoes a rest. Come inside now. Leave me alone! The grass has grown! What's wrong? Why are you so irritable? I'm not irritable! It gets narrow there. Keep going. All right. All right. All right. All right. I'm home. Mom, I'm here. -Hello, dear. -Hi, Mom. Welcome home. -It's nice to meet you. I'm Maeda. -Nice to meet you. -Thank you so much for coming. -Of course. Hello. -This is my mom and my grandmother. -It's a pleasure. -Darling, come on. Takashi, hurry. -Welcome to our home. This is a small gift from Hato Sable. -Thank you. -What a lovely gesture. -Please come in. -Pardon me. Okay. Hey, it's Takashi. -Are you taller? -Tadao! -Oh, come on. -You're so big. Come and sit down already. Tadao? -Darling! -It was around here. Hey, it won't be in there! Sit down! Forget about your camera. But it was somewhere in there. All right, let's make a toast. Please take this. Okay. Cheers! -Cheers! -Cheers! -Thank you for this. -Thank you for coming. -You've come so far. -It's fine. It's not much, but please dig in. I sure will. It's from an escape movie with somebody named McQueen. -I don't know any "McSomebody." -I do. I like McQueen. The Great Escape. That's it! Haruo Mizuno often shows it on television. Just as well as you gave up on acting for a proper job. -I see. -I wasn't really serious about it. -You seemed serious to me. -I did dream briefly about becoming an actor. But you went to a national university -and joined a good company. -That's right. Oh, this one wanted to become a singer. -Like Seiko Matsuda. -What? I didn't know. Stop it. And it wasn't Seiko Matsuda. She was always singing. -She even won a prize at a festival. -I said, stop! Is that so? You're good at singing. You should have tried it! -I never would've made it. -Who knows? Maybe you would've. Oh, what do you want to be, Takashi? What? Jackie Chan, right? -What? -Really? So do I. No, he doesn't like acting. Just Jackie Chan. I do not! That's great. It's a great dream. Why not be the next Jackie Chan? You should go for it. I want to help my kids chase their dreams. -What a lovely thought. -That's wonderful. Oh, I didn't mean anything by that. Mr. Oyama, I hear you write novels. He just aims for awards and never passes the first round. Who says I haven't? I've passed plenty of times. Well, that's impressive. I'd like to read one sometime. Really. Like you know what pure literature is. Why not lend him one? Nobody else wants to read them. What? Your novels? Oh, it doesn't have to be now. My camera. I know it's here. Forget it! How silly. -Sorry about this. -It's fine. Hey, you. Come over here. That really is impressive. The next Jackie Chan and a novelist. Only in their dreams. I hope they come true. Snake's fist! Snake's fist! Snake's fist! Say it before he gets too drunk. He's already cranky because of his novel. Yes. I hate this. I'm not making fun of the snake's fist. I'm not "snaking" fun of it. Takashi, don't get "snaky." How witty. -I'm going. -Wait! Sit down. Kneeling. Dad, come and sit down already. -Come on, darling. -Tadao. What? Oh, that's it! Come on, Dad! Please! Tadao! -Please sit down! -That hurts! All right! Don't pinch me! Mr. Oyama. Please give me your blessing to marry Haruko. I'm not much and I'm sure you think I'm still wet behind the ears. Even so, I'll do my best. I'll do my best. Whatever it takes to make Haruko happy. It's in there! Damn it, Dad! Tadao! Look for your camera later! Don't be pathetic! I'm not pathetic! It's your fault for always moving things like the television remote! Don't yell! We have a guest! Tadao! And... And you. You must be a failed actor because you don't fool me. If I wanted to find fault with you, I would have a field day. What? What has come over you? Maybe you do work for a good company, but how do we know? -Let me explain. -There's no need. Dad, you'd better knock it off right now. That's enough, Tadao. Get some sleep. Okay? Sleep. I'm sorry. He's been nervous all day, and he's drunk. I'm not drunk! I'm not! No. You're not drunk. Just lie down. Please. There you go again, -treating me like a child! -I'm not. Just lie down. -You think... -Care for some more? I'll be a good boy all my life. Well, you're wrong! I didn't break the bamboo fence! -What bamboo fence? -Enjoy. Back in elementary school, in our yard! I didn't break it! You and Dad blamed me but I didn't break it! The bike shop guy did! But I wasn't rebellious back then. Well, I'm in my rebellious phase now! If you look down on me, you better watch out! No one's looking down on you. Yes, you are! Knock it off! You need to stop dragging me down when things go bad for you! I know you got suspended and pretended not to know! You can't talk to me like that! -Hey! Where are you going? -Butt out! Who gives a shit? How dare you speak to me like that! You're an embarrassment! How dare you! I'm your father! It was my first-ever judo victory. What? Well... Well... What? What? Tadao! Hey! You would raise your hands to me? Fine! Hit me! Hit me all you like! I'm sick of this! Tadao! That was one hell of a show. -Come on! I'll get you! -Take me on if you can! -I'll get you! -Okay! -You're late, Takashi! -Hey, get over here! -These are going out! -Come on! Hurry up and get over here! Hurry up! You're so damn slow. You're going to see Kyoko Yokushimaru? How sweet. Take us with you. I'll give you a lint brush. Stylish, right? I'll give you a nightstick. No, I'll take that. Here, take it. -Titty-sucking is after midnight, right? -How exciting. Do a little job for us first. But we're just... What? Your video, The Story of O, was a waste of our valuable time. Take responsibility. -Take it! -You're responsible! -Let's go! -Gather at my finger. -Come on! -What? No way. Gather at what? When were you born? Move. We're going. Where's Takeuchi? -He said he's sick. -What? When I said Takeuchi was coming, Kaneda made me call him. He was just about to leave home, but when I told him about Kaneda, he said he has a fever. Was he serious? Hell no, he was lying! Let's snub him starting tomorrow. Mitsuru, you've been promoted. Takeuchi has been acting bossy lately. I hate him. We don't need him. Hey! Move or we'll break your fingers! Well... My tire is flat. -What? -What? Then get on mine. Get a move on. Hurry up! Not ramen, Chinese noodles! -I want soba noodles! -Shut up! Not rameen, it's ramen. -Piss off! -Piss off! I'm Yashiki! Yutaka Takagi is better! Nobody beats Fukumoto! Cromartie! Leon Lee! -All right! We made it! -Okay! -Hey! -Hey! Okay, come over here. Here. Right here. -Shall we? -Stop, and get off. -Okay. -What are you doing? Take this camera. A camera? The toilets here are haunted. So get a ghost on film. -What? -Shut up. It's for a ghost photo contest. The prize money is 50,000 yen. You can have 50 yen. You get 50 yen! We'll go ahead to World. Come when you get the photo. If you run, we'll smash your faces in. Don't be scared! -But this doesn't have a flash. -So what? You don't need a flash to shoot a ghost. Think, dummy. You've got a problem with that? What? -Go on! -Get to it! Go all the way! Come on! Hey! Yes! So what should we do? What do you think? We've got to do it. Mitsuru, tell us a joke. A joke? I don't know any. Anything is fine, just say something funny! The other day, when I was playing with myself, my dad caught me! What? That isn't funny at all. My mom caught me once. And don't say "playing with myself." It's embarrassing. So what should I say? I don't know. Think about it! -Masturbate? -That's even worse, dipshit! Do you think it's worse getting caught by your parents or catching your parents doing it? What? "Catching your parents?" Adults don't do that. Your parents do it? Well... No. I heard about it on the radio. Actually, the worst time was when Grandma caught me. A grandma is no big deal. This conversation is really boring. Change the subject, Mitsuru. I've got nothing. Anything is fine. Hurry up and say something. I've got nothing. Then sing something. No way. I can't sing. Is that it? Mitsuru, go do it. I can't. -Go! -I really can't! -Go, dammit! -I can't. I really can't go. Then do it from here. You do it, Takashi. This isn't going to work without a flash. Try to get closer. What? Why don't you do it? -Go, Mitsuru. -No! -Get going! -I really can't! -Let's all go together! -Go, damn it! Somebody is there! -What? -Understand? Even I graduated from university. It's true. It was a national university. Tit grab! If you don't study, your future is a gas station... What was that for? Tit grab. What was that for? You know, if you won't go to university, go to Koshien. Koshien would be good. When compared with Mitsuru's father, my dad didn't seem nearly as bad. He was nowhere near as bad. If we take a photo of them, they might look like ghosts. It probably won't come out. Come on. Hey. I'm going home. I'll see you tomorrow. Let's tell Takeuchi we sucked Yokushimaru's boobs. Then we'll snub him and call him Meathead. What are we going to do? From now? About what? Do we go home? What do you want to do? Kyoko Yokushimaru? You want to go? No. Let's go somewhere better. Like where? Follow me. Hey! Wait a minute! Take a right here. Hey, Mitsuru? What is it? I'm sorry for asking you this directly. Do you enjoy life? I mean... Think about it. You always get wrestling moves put on you and forced to do stuff. Don't you feel frustrated? I don't. Have you got some hidden talent? You know, like Noda makes movies. I don't. Seriously? If you did, I'd give you a brainbuster. I really don't. But I've started boxing recently. What? My dad did boxing. He beat Yoko Gushiken. Are you kidding me? He would never beat him. Do you have something, Oyama? A hidden talent. No. Nothing. But don't you want to be the next Jackie Chan? What? Your elementary school graduation essay. Don't read it, dipshit! You take over. Sure. What did you write? -For what? -Your graduation essay. Hikaru Genji. What the hell? Yoshioka and his guys made me. He was really scary back then. He told me to write about Hikaru Genji or Kōji Kikkawa. Yoshioka is totally one of Kaneda's guys now. Oyama? You were friends, right? You and Yoshioka. In elementary school. Not really. You know, we've never talked like this before. We did once in elementary school. On our third-year trip to Ohirayama. We went to the toilet. -You told me to come. -I don't remember. You don't? One of the girls shat her pants. Shit? So you said you would wash them for her. Oh, right. You remember that? I thought that was cool. You were cool. Here? It's here. What is this? Come on. Hey! Hey. What are you doing? What are you doing? They're doing it. What? They're boning. Hey! Do you come here to peek a lot? Sometimes. No way. They're doing it. Hey. Hey! That's the wrong one. That's mine. That's yours. Knock it off. Knock it off! Knock it off, damn it! I'm going. What are you doing? Move! Move, damn it! What the hell? Lick it. What? Just a little is fine. Hey, kid! Hey! Come here. Hang on. Do you want to eat this? Just eat it. It's on me. Thank you. What happened to you? You look like the world's ending. Is it good? Yes. Of course, it is. It's cat meat. What? I'm joking, idiot! Well, the truth is more surprising. Come on. Sit and eat. Relax. But Japan is on its last leg too. A girl as cute as this has to get naked? What do you think, kid? -What? -Take a look. "My pinched nipples feel divine." "I'll blast off into space." I'd like to enter her space. But my moves would take her further than just space. How about Saturn? Yes. -No doubt. -Sorry. -What time is it? -What? The time? I don't have a clock at my shop. Thank you. Hey, kid! Hey! I CAME IN HEAVEN YOKUSHIMARU IS COMING TO WORLD ON AUGUST 4TH That hurts! No pain! Welcome... The signing session? What? Kyoko Yokushimaru's autograph signing session. Today. It's here, today. What's that? Who told you that? You came for her autograph? You've been tricked. Wait a minute. You came in this afternoon. You rented a dirty movie. You and your wussy friends. How was it? What? Did you get off? No. Come here. What? I said, come here. I won't bite. Hold out your hand. Come on. Just squeeze. Come on. Squeeze harder. Actually, that was just a horny fantasy. In reality... Take it. It's pirated anyway. You know, I was an idol in Tokyo. I never got popular, though. Have you heard of me? Hiroko Okuda. No. I outdid Maiko Okamoto. Well... This. Thank you. Hold up! You're in the way! -Is that so? -You are! Hey, Takashi! -Hey, Takashi! -Where's Mitsuru? -Where are your friends? -What about Meathead? Meathead didn't come? Hey, what's with your face? -You're a bloody mess. -What's that? -What happened? -You okay? Oh, right. Did you get that photo? I did. -Nice. -Nice. More or less. All right. Thanks. -We'll check your work later. -And this? What is it? -Well... -Well? What is that? -What? -Really? The Yokushimaru autograph signing was real? We didn't see anything! -Did you even check? -I had a good look! Wait a minute. Did you? Did you suck on her tits? -Her tits. -Tits. -Well... -Well? Yes. No way! -Come on! -Let's go! -Let's go! -Hey! Wait a minute! -What is it? -Well... I was the last one. -What? -She's gone already. What? -What the hell? -What the hell? Hey! How did her tits taste? -Well? -The taste! Tell us, damn it! Oh, the taste. Like Chelsea. -Chelsea? -Chelsea? -Chelsea! -No way! Damn right! -Come on! -They're sweet! Damn it! They're coming. They're coming here. Hey! Look at this! What are junior high kids doing out here so late? What time is your curfew? I bet it's 5:00 p.m. Which junior high school? -If it's West, you're dead! -Or if it's East! -Kawakita! -Never heard of it! Year and class? Third year, class one! -And you? -Third year, class two! -And you? -Third year, class three! -Okay! -What are you looking at? Hey, you. You were looking at Megumi. The penalty is 100,000 yen, so pay up. Now! What? What the hell is wrong with you? Are you sick? Bladder catarrh? Nocturnal enuresis? What a loser. How pathetic. Leave him alone. You're lucky, kid. Your old playmate is here. You're "Piss-Pants Taka." You've been like that since nursery school! What a loser! "Piss-Pants!" -Hey, pay up. -Pay up. No bills smaller than 5,000 yen. What do we have here? -What the hell? -Spill it. Not even a 10,000 yen bill. Don't you have a stack? Thanks. -He's flat broke. -Oh, well. You better hurry home! Your moms will be worried. That's rich coming from you, "Shit-Pants Megumi!" You... shit your pants on that school trip. Remember who washed them for you? Do you know how bad they stunk? You should apologize by letting me feel your big tits! Hey, kid. Did fear drive you crazy? I... He isn't crazy! What? You want to feel them? I... Spit it out! Then feel them! Fucking do it! I can't... You're pathetic. There was only one time you weren't. Scary. Go for it, Takashi! Come on. Feel her up! Come here! Go for it! Takashi! Come on! Takashi! Your face is messed up. Kaneda? Well, so is mine. You've got some balls on you. You nearly touched Megumi's tits. I guarded Kyoko Yokushimaru for you. Maybe Megumi likes you. No, not a chance. I can't figure chicks out. That hurts. Do you want to swim? There's no time like the present. What are you looking at? Strip off. This feels good. What the hell, man? Get in. Come on, get in! Don't be a pussy! Get in. Hey! What happened to your face? Where were you? Nowhere. I just fell over when I was running. You fell over? Why are you washing that? It's not ours. What? Well, you see... It was dirty. What? So I'm washing it! Takashi. What? Am I pathetic? What? Of course, you are. You're pathetic. Really pathetic. But... I wish you were cool. I wish I was cool too. Wait! Hey! You're not pathetic because of me. It's your own fault. Dad! Why are you washing his car? Mr. Oyama, I'll do that! It's all wet. Who asked you to? Leave it. I'll wash it. Why? Who asked you to? Get Mom to help if you insist on doing it. I'll take over. Hey! What happened to your face? Were you in a fight? Did you fall over? What happened? Dad is acting weird again. Stop splashing! This whole area is wet! It's clean now. Look out. -Look out! -You'll get wet. Dad, stop it. Why are you so stubborn? It's clean now. Washing a car without permission is almost a crime. But it'll rain tomorrow morning. Dad, you never wash your car. Get Mom to help you. You'll get wet! You never do this. Why are you doing this? It's clean now. You can stop, sir. When are you going to stop? This is a pain in the ass. Oh, Dad, give it a rest. -Mr. Oyama. -Dad, you really shouldn't do this. That window. I'll wash that window. That's enough, sir! I'll do it! He just had the car washed. So leave it, please. -Mr. Oyama. -Dad! Dad! What are you doing? Mom, talk him out of it. We told him to stop, but he wouldn't. Stop it! Don't touch that! Okay. Is this to make up for yesterday? Well, it's not enough! Just let me wash the car! Why do I have to shout like this? I'm cutting ties with you! Haru? You want to wash it? Then go ahead. Wash it, dear. I'll help, sir. It's a dustcloth. I mean it, Dad! Let me wash it! AUGUST 5TH, 1987 6:23 A.M. What? So that's where the camera was.
