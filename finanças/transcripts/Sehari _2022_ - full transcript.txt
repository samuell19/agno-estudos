I've been saying you since four years, but still you refuse me. Shreya kept talking about them too. I think it's high time to change, Varun. It's not like that Subbu. - Pch. You know what Varun? you're hopeless! Subbu! Subbu! His been feeling suffocated for four years now, but still he wants to marry her. Varun.. ..are you sure about this? - Yeah sis, she's my future wife. I've to accept her, no matter what. - Hmm. Gosh! 'Tomorrow is the day.' [music] Hey Subbu.

You have been doing, all these since a week. Varun. - How could she leave me like this sis? how can she be so heartless? Tell me. - I can understand Varun. It's completely natural to feel this way. Can I tell you one thing? You can make anyone happier around you.. As you were in such a toxic relationship for four years. You deserve someone so much better. So much better. Stop worrying about all these. She will realize what she lost, when you become successful. What she lost. Do you understand? Yes, It makes sense now. - What? Thank you Sis.. Thank you Sis.. - Hey.

So what? - Our coffee tastes good sir. Then get it. - Ok sir, thank you. Why does he want to get married? How can he think like that? Will any one get married after breakup? Hey, our previous generations used.. ..to get married at an early age. Do you get that? I'm happy, that Varun is bringing back that Culture. I like it, I appreciate him. - Shut your mouth.. ..you're the one who supports him, everytime he takes foolish decisions. Oh. Varun. - I'm Aliya. It seems we met during our childhood, my dad said. Oh yeah, even my dad said so.. ..but I don't remember as it is during our childhood. Varun, what do you do? Me? ..I am into real estate. As of now. But after marriage, I'll take care of dad's office. Real estate!, that's nice. Yeah, What do you do? Not yet decided, I'm still thinking. - Oh, no problem. It's good, Nice. Varun, this marriage. I mean.. ..are you ok with this arranged marriage? - Marriage.. I mean, arranged marriage. Good Question! Very good question. Good question! Very Good question! What's that? Are you conducting an interview? Not that way, Look at me.. Actually I like arranged marriages.. ..I just wanted to marry a girl like you, - No it's just you. I knew it.. The day I saw your pic, that you're the one for me. You got your friends for family meet. Are you guys close? Actually, just for moral support. So Aliya, what about you? Dad is very friendly and supportive, and I have a sister.. ..she is a fashion designer. She have a lot of goals.. ..and she is not interested in marriage. So, I am getting married first. Ok, so you have an elder sister. She said she'll come here directly from office. She should have come by now. Oh, that's ok. So.. Have you decided? - Decide? I mean about us. [blushes] It's set. Don't you think that they like each other? - Yeah.. Yeah.. Are you able to sense that! - I can see that they are happy. You are happy about it right? - As long as they are happy, I am happy. Varun. - Uncle. You are handling real estate at a small age, is all good? Yeah uncle, good. All good. Everyone who gets rental payments, calls it a real estate. Did you both have a nice chat? Are you guys really comfortable with each other? Yes uncle, we are comfortable. You sure she's better than Subbu? - Are you nuts? She is much better. I'm happy, then.

Stop bothering about her, she is the bride's sister. I just asked casually. Feel glad that you're getting married and stop bothering about others marriage.. ..just mind your business. - Okay. [phone ringing] Yeah Surya. - Vikram, I forgot to inform you that.. ..as per our family's custom.. ..bride and groom shouldn't see each other before marriage. Then how about the premarital formalities? - It's not a big deal.. ..Amulya and Varun can take care. - Hmm, okay Surya. Now that you said it's your custom, We respect that. - Thank you, Vikram. Okay. Hey. You and Aliya shouldn't meet before marriage it seems. What.. ..how is it possible? - How Vikram, then who will do these arrangements? And who will manage all these? - Uncle, how they can be so orthodox.. ..we are not from backward areas, we're in the city. - Shut up, moron. Atleast you speak out. - Whatever uncle said is correct. You people won't change. But dad, who will take care of arrangements then? You are free right, you and Amulya take care of it. [notification tone] With Amulya? Okay. Cool! Sis.. Sis.. - Disgusting.

I want to change, so I am getting married.. ..see I am happy now. - Happy, it seems! Who does this at the age of 24? So what, sis? Ask me if I ever get into trouble again. Whatever Varun, I hope you know what you are doing. Chill Sis.. I got this. Cheers, man. Varun, you made a wrong decision. He being an 80's kid isn't yet married, you being 90's kid! I'm not the one who I use to be before anymore.. I am a changed man now. Are you a clown in the circus, who keeps changing always? Hey! stop it. He's getting married, and it's a happy occasion, so let's drink. Varun listen.. - You don't say anything. Varun, you are marrying Aliya right, it is a good thing, really nice.. ..But Amulya is alone now. I have a feeling that, may be Amulya and I can be more than friends. [burst of amused laughter] Why are you laughing like siren? It's just that, You buy nice branded clothes and things.. but why not a small mirror as well! Now-a-days people are using iPhones as mirrors. You won't understand, you short 90's kid.. Who's the shorty? - It's you, Shorty. Stop and have it. - Hello. Hi, Is this Varun? - Yeah, who is this? Amulya this side. - Oh hi, what's up. Is it a good time to talk? - Yeah, go ahead. Dad already informed you.. ..that we need to do the arrangements for engagement right? Oh, yeah. He said. Shall we meet up once to discuss that? Sure, where? 11 am Tomorrow at Radisson. Ok cool. I'll see you tomorrow then. - Okay see you. Make two pieces of this. - Okay ma'am. [notification tone] Destination Wedding would be nice. Is it Aliya? - Amulya! Amulya? What for? - Nothing, it's regarding the arrangements. She said she will meet me tomorrow. - So, I'll join you too. Please don’t ruin it. She is the bride's sister. But No. - Let me.. No! Please, man. - No. Hi Aliya. - Hi sister. Where are you heading? - To make arrangements. Don’t take all the burdens. If you need some help just ask me. That's fine, but.. Aliya? - Yes. Are you sure about this marriage? Yes sis, you don't worry. Now that we are preparing for engagement, I just wanted to be sure.. Yes. - Yeah.. Yeah. Okay. I’ll take your leave. You have a nice day. I said NO, right? - but I said I’ll come. Why the hell are you doing this? - My life my rules. Avoid this sort of stupidity in front of Amulya. She's the sister of bride, please dude. I can take care of this. - I told you to not to do this.. Easy bro. - Hi Varun. Hi Amulya. - Hi.. Hi.. Didn’t you order anything? -Not yet, We've been waiting for you. Feel free, What do you want? Sir, what do you want sir? - One Espresso. One Expresso! - Make it two and get a boost for him. One Cold Coffee. - Cold Coffee it seems, drop ice cubes in the coffee and bring it. Thank you, sir. You were there too in the restaurant the other day, right? Oh yeah, by the way this is... I can introduce myself. This is Vasu. Hi. - V Dawg, I am a rapper. Rapper, that’s nice. Thank you, What do you do? I design clothes. Fashion designer means stitching clothes and doing ramp walks. So Amulya, you said some arrangements. Oh yeah, we have only 15 days left for engagement. We have a lot to do, decide Venue, food, jewellery, clothes and most important.. ..we have to fix a theme. - 15 days is a very less time and.. ..I didn’t do it before, so you guide me. - Right. if we decide a theme, then we can decide a venue. - Theme means? Western, Indo-western and Indian something like that. Oh, Theme! - Yes. How about a super hero theme? I’m just kidding. Amulya, marriage would go as per traditions anyway.. Why can’t we go with Indo-western for engagement? - Perfect.. ..Indo-western. Accordingly, we can decide the venue. Even, you have to come a few times. - Yeah sure. Why are we working on these? I mean.. Why shouldn't we hire an Event Manager? We don’t need to work hard also.. Yeah, that’s true. - Varun, this engagement is too personal for me. My mom would take care of these, if she’s alive.. Now, I want to take that responsibility. Responsibility, Wow! Can we handle such a huge responsibility? - Hmm! Yeah Varun, I’m sure. And even you are with me. Ok then bye, I’ll see you. [music] Is she blind, she didn’t notice me? - Come and scratch my back. [cicadas critter] Hey. ..are those arrangements going on well? - Yes dad, going good. So, are you comfortable or do you need any help? - No. we're good. Everything will be finished on time, you don’t worry dad. Okay, if you need anything let me know. Nothing like that dad, I’ll handle. - Amulya is a decent girl.. Don't be with her the way you're with us, Behave yourself. No.. no.. Varun seems to be a nice guy. Now that Aliya is getting married right.. I’ll be happier if you get married soon too. Dad, I’m not against to marriage, just saying no for now. Let my show be successful and let me establish my own brand.. and then as per your wish. That's it right? Or is it your past that's still interfering with your decision today? Dad, I have already forgotten about that, but you didn’t. I am happy, Cheers. [notification tone] [keyboard clacking] [music] Hi. Is Amulya inside? - Are you Varun? Yeah. - Please sit, I’ll inform her. No issues, I’ll wait. You carry on with your work. Hey, Hi Varun. - Hey Amulya. Do you guys design clothes for books as well? Basically, tons of fabric gets wasted every year... ..we have designed this with that. I know that it’s a little expensive.. ..but it helps the environment. So, it's fine. That’s really interesting Amulya. Amulya.. Why did you name your studio as Saachi? - It means Goddess of Beauty. Oh, deep - Ma'am, finalize the fabric please. Use mulberry silk, not this. - Sure ma'am. We have 20 days for fashion show, and only 10 days for engagement. So, first priority is engagement, also Shiva call Basha. - Sure ma'am. Varun, if you can give your measurements.. I’ll get your engagement dress ready. Hey no no. Why to take burden in this busy schedule? - C'mon, it's okay. I’ll wear something. - Basha, take his measurements. Amulya, are you sure about this? I never wore a designer clothes in my life. It's okay, Varun. I wanted to design for you particularly. So, don’t worry. I won’t disappoint you. Okay. Bro, for biceps. No need? okay. Perfect. Amulya did you start this on your own? - Yeah. I worked as an intern for a designer called Mihir. And then I resigned, started my own label. also my dad is so supportive too.. ..it worked out. Wow, that’s great, that’s really nice infact. [phone ringing] One second. - Yeah. Hello, I am coming. Okay, I'll leave. - No.. No.. One second. Here’s a little gift for you and your friends. My friends? - Yes. Thank you. - You're most welcome. Arranging a party on this open terrace, rather than pubs and bars.. ..Now I believe that you're a changed man, You are great. You are great, greater and greatest. I think I find Amulya interesting. What are you speaking? What the hell is he speaking, are you a human? You just went and selected a bride.. and now you are finding her sister interesting? What's wrong with him? You're acting as if I'm doing this deliberately.. ..it just happened naturally. - Natural? Vinni, at least you convince him. What should I? He is reacting, correct for the first time. He could've almost lost the bottle, after listening to what you just said. I have to accept her good, bad and ugly. No matter what. Convey all of these Soap opera dialogues to your watchman. What is my context and what are you speaking, you stupid. Did he just call me a stupid? - Ofcourse he did! You are a stupid. - You are an idiot. Don’t you have common sense? She's sister of the bride. What is your interference in my love story? STOP IT, GUYS. Can’t we just sit and speak peacefully? - You go and do meditation. Get lost. - What are you saying? Do you have common sense? - Don't I have common sense? What the hell are you speaking? - It’s my love, man. Hey Varun, take it easy. You're thinking too much. You don’t have a chance with her. Stop this and be practical. I didn’t do anything voluntarily, meeting her.. ..at her office and spending time with her, it’s magical. Oh my god, please Varun, it’ll not work out. Take it easy. Just go with the flow. Ok, just go with the flow.. Go with the flow. Go with the flow. - What are you thinking, she's elder than you. Go with the flow. "Just like a dream" "The world has hid you" "Just like a tale" "Just like a tale" "It is enough it showed you" "You stopped my world with some of your magic" "There is no way of being alone My days are with you" "You casted some magic and changed my path" "My soul is happy and I’m floating in confusion" "My soul is happy and I’m floating in confusion" "The fun has started between us" "Hey" "This is so awesome" "Hey" "This is so awesome" "This is so awesome" "This is so awesome" "This is so awesome" "Whatever may happen around me" "I'm wishing you to be with me" [music] "I confederated on myself till yesterday, As you are not with me" "When I am with you today It feels so good" "I spent my time just like that till now" "And now I am roaming with your works as mine" "Spending my whole day with you and want to spend some more" "With you, I am in a world with no alarm" "My style changed just like yours.

"This is so awesome" "This is so awesome" "This is so awesome" "This is so awesome" So, is all set Varun? By the way, your engagement suit is over there, go and try it. Okay, thanks.. Tomorrow is your big day, Are you excited? - Big day! Varun, it’s your engagement. - Yes, it’s my engagement right.. ..Yeah, I’m excited. - Get some rest. Bye. Hey, he is getting married and you are 4 years elder than us.. ..but you're still the same, you don't wanna think about marriage? Hey, you are aware about my demand right. A lot of people are in pipeline. Anyway, once he gets married. ..then Amulya will be single and I’m single. - I like Amulya. Kill us.. Kill us both.. Is it a brain or fan, swinging so much? Bipolar fellow! - Are you out of your mind? You like Amulya? She is 4 years older than you, Do you remember? - Why are you yelling? ..he told me to go with the flow, hence I went with the flow. Go with the flow means to be with Aliya.. ..not with her sister. - It’s not that. Now, will you ask your father in law.. to get you married with the elder one instead of younger one? He is just like a villain in movies, keeps saying.. 'It's not uncle, it's father-in-law' ..he will not spare us. Do you understand? Leave all of these.. ..and get engaged to Aliya. I am telling you this as a friend of yours... ..go and get engaged. Why are you staring like that? What are you confused about? Did he explain rocket science to you, or what? [music] "As a part in dilemma.. the heart became very hard" "As he's the King who hides the Queen's name" "and his heart becomes like a Drunken-monkey" "To be honest, My dear He survived by seeing you, My dear" "Even mirror became Moody, by seeing you" "After saying everything's ok. It came back to square one" "Saying to quit, is a mistake" Varun. - Dad. I am happy for you. Even from now, leave all the stupid things. I believe that you’ll behave matured from today onwards. It is a big day for you.. Congrats. [music] [upbeat instrumental music] Shit.. Shit.. - Hey. I don’t understand anything, I am getting mad. Why's this even happening to me? - What happened now? Let’s stop this engagement. - Stop this engagement? Yes, I got clarity that I like Amulya. I like Amulya. Why do you like Amulya? How can I explain, it’s a feeling which can’t be expressed in words. What is he saying? - Does Amulya know about this? Don’t know. - Ok does she like you atleast? Nope. Then why do you wanna dare to stop this engagement? I don’t understand either.. This is not the right time for all these. Do one thing, marry Aliya. For the first time you are correct. - I am always correct. Oh Gosh, Ok. Go and be with Aliya and stop blabbering about Amulya. Listen to me and stop convincing me. - Varun, can I come in? Yeah Uncle. - Stop calling me uncle and call me as Mamayya. Yeah, uncle.. Mamayya.. Mamayya.. - All good.. ..I just came to check on you. - Yes Uncle.. ..sorry Mamayya! - I wanted to say something. You are a very good man. - Thanks. I am very happy that you're my son-in-law. Aliya is very lucky to get you as husband. Even Amulya is lucky. Sorry. - Nothing uncle, I was saying the same. Ok Varun, I think you are getting late. I’ll see you on the stage. Yeah, I will see you mavayya. I will see you. It’s too late, stop all these and go. What are you staring at? Come. - Listen, It’s love. Look at her. I can’t.. I can’t.. - You come with me. I knew that you’ll do something like this. I have a solution for this. Have this and go. You're going to be alright. You're great, man. Nope, you're great, greater, greatest. Thanks, man. Amulya, I need to share something important with you. Could you please come with me? What happened Varun? We are getting late. Just one minute, I’ll explain it to you. What? - Come with me. [phone ringing] One second, I need to take this call. Tell me, What happened Varun? I know that this isn't the right time to tell you this now. But I might not get a chance later to tell you this again. So, I'm telling you now.. I like you. I really like you. Are you drunk? - Yeah, cos' Vasu forced me. Varun, you are really drunk man. What’s wrong with you? People are waiting for you.. ..and it’s getting late for your engagement Aliya is waiting for you. Please Come. Amulya.. Amulya.. Amulya.. - You stupid.. ..are you drunk? - No dad. Breathe. Breathe properly. Do you think it’s a drunk and drive, Just breathe out. I didn’t think that it’ll smell. Vasu did it all. I swear on my father. What's all this? This match is more than good for your qualification. Just get on the stage and behave decently. What's wrong? - He's coming, it's okay. Where were you ? I went to pee. Varun, place the ring on her finger. Varun, what's wrong? - You fool, place the ring. Varun, people are staring at us. Varun. [firecrackers bursting] Congratulations. Sir, look at this side. Smile. "To dance and sing there is no such thing like celebration in my life" "To chill or laugh, there is no such thing like celebration in my life" "SEHARI" Hey Behave yourself, at least for once in your life regarding this matter.. No one noticed your behaviour in the engagement or else my pride... Dad, have some water. Water is good for you. Have it. What is he doing? Look at that nice father and son.. ..bonding like a family drama movie type. - It’s a highlight. Even my forefathers also didn’t have this type. But I only have one father. Please man, stop joking. - Ok. Hi Uncle, how are you? - Hi Uncle. Hi Varun, is all ok? - Hi, bud. Uncle, engagement went good. It was really good. wow! so many guests.. Why so serious uncle? Uncle is still in engagement hangover it seems, let’s leave. Hey. - Uncle. Do you know what he did yesterday? What did this stupid do, Uncle? Most of the decisions you take may not affect your family.. ..but you have to rethink while taking a decision which affects your family. I told you what I wanted to. You make him understand. Okay, uncle. Varun.. ..Uncle have a bright future in serials. I have been telling, whatever your dad said is correct. Enough man, now I understood. I behaved like a fool.. ..I feel foolish while I think that I liked a girl who's four years elder to me. And what dad said is correct. I am going to marry Aliya. Good, finally you understood, so Aliya is set? Amulya. - Amulya? Amulya’s call. - Answer it. Varun, where are you? - At home, what happened! Nothing, I brought Oliver to Dog Park, can you come? Yeah, Will come. - Okay. Amulya is asking me to meet. Okay fine. Now that you chose Aliya, it's okay to meet, go and meet Amulya. Wait, if it’s Amulya, I think I should come along with you. Didn’t he listen? Hi Amulya. - Hi Varun. Get hold of Oliver. - Yeah. I’ll get something to drink. Would you like something? - No thanks.. I got drunk yesterday right. I am asking about Tea, Coffee,juice or Water. - Water should be fine. Ok sure. Yeah. Hey Oliver. Here you go. Varun, shall we start with marriage preparations or do you need time? Let’s start.. Let's start. - Are you Okay? Yeah I'm good.. I'm good. Do you remember what happened yesterday? - What happened? It’s my engagement. - Then you said.. ..that you like me a lot. What was that about? Oh, I’ll say that even now. I like you, out of respect.. Out of utter respect.. ..After all you are Aliya’s sister. I respect you quite a lot. Oh, respect! - Yeah, respect. Varun, why are you getting married? Good question.. Very good question. Did you observe Aliya, she is so beautiful. Cut the crap Varun. Tell me the truth, Why are you getting married? Subba Lakshmi, my girlfriend. Huh? My ex- girlfriend. It all started very beautifully. Colorfully, beautifully, and happily. Everyday was a Valentine’s Day back then. I used to get lost in time watching her smile. Then entered Shreya just like a horror film in our honeymoon phase. She spoiled our relation by infesting all nonsense to Subbu.. out of jealousy or sadness. By listening to all of those. - VARUN. Gosh, Subbu.. Subbu.. I'm sorry Subbu. I used to endure all of these, but the hopes she gave about marriage! Varun, let’s shift into a new villa after our marriage. - Sure Subbu. I want two kids. A girl and a boy. No, I want twins. I don’t want dogs. - No problem Subbu, it’s your wish. As you wish Subbu. - Aww, Varun! Kids! - You got shocked for this? She used to get so dramatic like.. Varun, you will leave me! - Why would I leave you? we will always be together. - I know. Subba Lakshmi, who gave me so many hopes, left me for Rohit. Do you know how hurt I was and how much I cried? So, I thought to get married to make her feel jealous. You want to marry to make her feel jealous. - Hey no, that’s then, not now. I am a changed man now. I have clarity on everything. Yeah. I have clarity on everything. I have clarity, Yeah. Varun, if I'm in Subba Lakshmi’s place I wouldn't have done that to you. Also, I wouldn’t miss out on a guy like you. [music] Varun, No.. No.. Amulya, I wanted to as you something. If I may to ask? Yes please - Why didn’t you get married till now? Well, I.. [phone ringing] One second. Hello, Yes sir. No sir, we'll be there on time. The model list will be on your office table by tomorrow, I promise. No sir, it’s all happening, don’t worry. Okay! Thank you. Amulya, Is everything okay? - There is a fashion show in 5 days.. ..just little tensed about that. At this moment, I can’t recruit.. ..new people and can’t manage with this staff. So don't know what to do. I don’t how much can we help, but if you are Ok, we will help you. Why to stress you Varun, you’ll be busy in marriage arrangements. It's okay. Why would I be so busy while you are handling everything. I’m just accompanying you. I will get satisfied if I can be helpful to you. Are you sure? - Yeah. Ok. Hmm. Oliver. Oh shit.. - Pass.. Pass.. What are you doing here till now? - Take it easy. ..what happened over there. She has an event in 5 days and she is short of manpower.. ..so I promised her that we will help her. Whom did you ask before promising her? Do you think we are just loitering? Hey, Remember one thing.. Most of the decisions you take may not affect your friends.. but you have to rethink while taking it. Stop joking. - I’ll tell one thing. - No, please don't. Now that you said it’s Amulya. Tell me where are we going and what time? Don’t feel too much! Tomorrow morning sharp 9. Where is he? - What is this? Wait, I’ll tell. Where are you? - I’m here itself, Just wait for 5 mins. I’m just parking my car. - Come fast. Is it a cloth store? - It’s a designer studio, not a cloth store. Don’t embarrass me. Am I late? - Yes, you will come by 9 PM if we say by 9 AM, stop talking about discipline. Not like that. - Shut up. Stop being jerks. Behave decent like me. As in, do you want us to flirt with Amulya like you? Yeah Amulya, we are here Yeah, coming. What's wrong with him, man - Gosh! hell with him. Hi Amulya. - Hi guys, thank you so much for coming. Of course it’s my responsibility. Uh, It's our responsibility. Amulya, what shall we do? How do we start? Do you have any idea about fashion show? Yeah. Is it like Ftv thing where girls with short dresses walk around? Yes almost, but ours is an ethnic show. And our models will wear ethnic wear. So, our models will wear saris? - Yes, something like that. Firstly, you select a few models from our list. Models. - Yeah. Sure totally. - Awesome, cool, see you guys. Bye. - Bye. Do they look like models? Hey, hold on. It’s Shreya. Is she also a model? We should have confidence like this in life to do anything. Are you selecting her now? Can’t you even understand a joke? Low IQ fellow. - Joke! Hey see this. - What is this? These are the things we should do after model selection. We have to work very hard, and we have to make Amulya proud, at any cost. And we have a lot to do. - Don’t give speeches like Obama.. we understood that there’s a lot to do. Let’s get to work. Okay. "Oh God.. Oh God.." "Oh Girl.." "Oh Girl.." "Oh Girl.." ..who are these guys" "Oh Girl, stood for you" "They are for you By keeping their work aside" "They trusted you blindly" "Oh god, there’s a lot to discuss" "Even though it’s not a story, still I’ll tell" "You will never come I’ll count on you" "There is no way to go as all ways are closed" "These are the guys who can be trusted even they are stupid" "We all will small by the way these guys work" "The story of these two is very tight" "As if it’s like a war between fellow wives" "The position of the man is like a poor church mouse" "Thought that this work is easy Until I stepped inside this" "I’m just managing this based on my intelligence" "Just like the ants near the sugar" "They all are near the girl for support" "They are unstable.. ..but strong" "Oh god, did you listen to me" "Even though you don’t, I still told you" "You will never come I’ll count on you" "There is no way to go as all ways are closed" Thank you so much for making this event a huge success. Congratulations! - Thank you so much guys.. ..we need to celebrate. Where shall we go for dinner? But, you said celebration? - Oh sure. Congrats Amulya. Beautiful. Nice place Amulya, I like your taste. - What? How many times have I begged you to party here? Hello. - Vasu, you are of my age.. ..then how come you are their classmate? - I’ll tell you. He is in 4th year when we are in 1st year.. Later, He was still in 4th year even after we got to 4th year.. That's the matter. You, You are the one who's speaking about me. My name is Vasu and he is Varun.. he changed his name as Vinni to match with our names. Vinni means, Vinukonda Ramachandra Rao. Stop the nonsense. - You and your silly discussions. Won’t you change? The GDP of our country got decreased by 23%.. what’s your analysis on this? You need intellectual topics to talk about! Hey, Amulya. How are you? After so many days? What Amulya? You don't even wanna give me a hug? Hi, Mihir. How are you? I’m fine. We met after a long time. Yeah. - What a surprise? - Varun, he is Mihir, Friends? Mihir, is he the one whom you worked for? - Yeah. Hey, Mihir Whatsup? Come join us. Let’s have a shot. I would love to, but my friends are waiting. Got to go- Oh, that's okay. Alright see you. - Alright, see you buh-bye! Bye Amulya, see you guys. - Bye man. Let’s continue. - Yes, Let’s continue. Amulya, let's have another shot. - Cheers.. Cheers.. It’s getting late. Shall we leave? Amulya, shall we leave? Do it man. Yeah. - Okay. Come guys. - We still want to drink? Hey! we are drinking. Go to hell. - Bye. Amulya left without bidding good bye. - Leave it. She is really blind. Hey stop it. Bro, just wait for 5 mins I’ll come. - Okay sir. Move.. Move.. - Varun, it’s Ok you go. It’s getting late. You are drunk? - What about you? I had a little. It’s okay, it's just a 5 min walk. Amulya, are you ok? - Yeah. Why did you ask? - It's nothing, you are being silent while walking.. I wanted to ask you something, if I may ask? - Yeah sure. Why didn’t you get married till now? Please don’t answer if you don’t want to. Hey Amulya, I’m sorry if I caused you any trouble. Mihir, the one you met now, is my ex-boyfriend. Oh, if you don’t want to continue, then no. - It's okay. Two and a half years back, I worked as an intern for Mihir. He was smart, good looking, charming and matured. He has all the qualities I like in a man. I started liking him, while we are working together. I got scared to tell him. But then one day, Amulya, your designs are excellent. - Thank you. So, What's your plan for tonight? Dinner? Sure. Our relation started like that. That's okay, I understood. Tell me about the breakup part. I’m telling the same to you, listen. - Okay.. Okay.. Sorry, carry on. So, that one year was so beautiful. But, suddenly he started behaving weirdly. He always pretended to be busy and didn't give me attention. I don't know why! But I started doubting him. so, I went to his home to speak with him personally.. You went to Mihir’s house. Then what? then I caught him with Charu. Charu? Charu, is she even more beautiful than you? Charu is not a female, he is a man. Oh! What are you talking? It’s not about that, Varun. At least, he should have opened up to me. I would have understood him. I felt really bad and got hurt. That’s why I started focusing more on my passion than on my marriage. Touch wood, everything is going well. Can I tell you one thing? If I was Mihir I wouldn't have ever done that to you. And also I wouldn’t miss out on a girl like you. [honking] Yes coming the cab driver is calling, I’ll see you tomorrow. Okay, bye Amulya.

My dad sold this after mom passed away. I will feel positive vibes, whenever I come here. Yeah. I understand, it must be very emotional for you. Infact, I'm very emotional like you. All my childhood memories are wonderful actually. During exams, I always wanted to eat Apparao Custard Ice cream. My dad used to scold and beat, if I ask him. By seeing all of that my mom used to get that ice cream for me. My exam stress got vanished when I started eating that ice cream. That’s why I got 29th rank. - Is it a state rank? Nope, class rank. I’m telling all this cos' I want Apparao Custard Ice cream during my wedding feast. It’s very emotional for me. Amulya.. Listen to me. It's difficult man, really difficult. - Sir please sir. Didn't I tell you already? Shankar Tummalapalli. - Yes, what can I for do you? We need to book venue for my sister’s marriage on 23rd of this month. Sorry, it’s difficult, you need to book 3 months in advance. Sir, it’s my marriage. Even her parents got married here; it’s very emotional for us. It’s too difficult. - Sir, it’s our sentiment, please do something. Even though you feel sentimental.. that person is trying for shooting since 1 week.. ..What should I tell him? Sir, we can reschedule the shooting.. ..but we can’t reschedule a marriage. Please do something; there will be an other way out. Please help us. Ok, pay the advance and I’ll block the date. - Yeah sure. Yeah. Take this. - Thank you so much. Sir, thank you so much. Welcome, Sir. - Let's go. Sir, it's too much. - What? Why did you request him? He accepted for that or else I would have begged him also.. ..as you said it’s emotional for you. Finally, we confirmed the venue I looked for. Nice, are there any plans for us today? No. Nothing for today. - I’ll take you somewhere today then. Where? - Wait till we reach there. Come.. Come.. Why are we here Varun? - Just wait for two mins. Oh, I can’t whistle right! Pooja Akka! Open it. What? - Have a look. "Our companion.. is the only dream of my life" "I promise you'll watch forever.. once you've seen my world" Varun, coffee? - No thanks, sis. Do you need? - You don’t want to come? No, you go. - Sure! Yeah.. Yeah.. Hi. - Hi. Thank you. - You are welcome. You both look good. I got tensed when he told me about marriage. In fact, I mistook that he's taking a wrong step. But after looking at you I am happy for him. Actually, I can feel that vibe around you. Is Varun your family friend? - The Golden Retriever over there.. ..was Varun’s. When his family said no to that a few years ago, he brought it to me. From then we were friends, he became my brother. We all have a kid inside us whom we all like; he is not like that.. ..and he is a pure soul. Amulya, shall we leave? - Yeah sure. Okay let's go. See you later sister. It was lovely meeting you. - It was lovely meeting you. "In your laughs.. I forgot my sorrows" [music] So, what’s the plan tonight? - Plan! Vasu has a rap battle tonight. Rap battle? - Yeah. He does silly things like this once in a while. I’m just going for moral support.. Varun, can I also come? Why? That performance will be embarrassing, so you take it easy. Please Varun, I want to see Vasu’s performance. It’s not performance; it’s circus. I am not coming for you, I’m coming for Vasu. Is it? You want to come for Vasu? Okay, Come. you gonna witness his performance. [indistinct chatter] [crowd cheering] "V Dawg.. V Dawg.." Why are you so late? - We were busy with wedding arrangements. Why did you bring Amulya here?

Your world is so nice Varun. It’s simple and beautiful, Anyone can be happy in your world. Aliya is so lucky. Bye Varun. Sis.. What happened? [music] "Does the dreams which melt away.. ..have the courage to leave the eyes?" "There are many unspoken twists.. ..and heart moves with fear" "Can it stop?" "Is there a way out?" "Is it disturbing?" "In the paths of imagination.. ..had many dreams?" "These games made me cross the shore" "Is this the silence which defeats?" "Mind is roaming itself and heart moves with fear" "The past is firm.. ..and remained truly" What happened dear? - Nothing dad.. All okay? - ..just marriage things. Sis. - Hello Varun? How are things going on? All ok sister. - You're got quite busy after getting engaged right? Nothing like that, even I want to meet you. "This lonely journey.. ..is bitter" "I came to know what I missed" "Even though there are many stars" "The sky wishes for the moon's companion" "My heart is only expecting you.. ..even though there are many around me" "Mind is roaming itself and heart moves with fear" "The past is firm.. ..and remained truly" What happened? I got a problem, sis. - What happened again? I’m not ready for this marriage. What? - Calm down, Sis. Everyone will react the same, after listening to this.. ..but you’ll understand my situation after listening to my perspective. Which situation? This marriage is not correct. I took all decisions in my life hastily. I did out of ignorance back then.. ..but now I’m completely aware of my mistake. You sure you're telling me this now after giving it a thought? It’s my marriage in three days, after that there will be nothing to think. I don’t know what did you think? But you should not regret about your decision later. If you feel that this is correct.. ..go and tell them. Hey Aliya. Your wedding saree. It’s a beautiful saree Go and try this. Not now.. ..It will definitely look great cos' you designed it. Do what I say, go and change. Thank you, Amulya. Why thanks dad? - You took all the responsibilities.. ..and didn’t let us feel that your mother is missing. I'm really so proud of you. Isn’t it nice Vikram? - Wow, Wonderful Amulya, it's so good.. Thank you. Varun, see how good the design is? Say thanks to her. - Thank you. Ok Aunty, I’ll leave. - Why so hurry? Have dinner and go. No Uncle, I have many works to do. - But next time definitely. Ok, take care. - Bye. Hey! Drop her off at the car and come back. So all set right Varun? I’ll get the venue arrangements finished tomorrow.. And don’t go out. - Amulya, I don’t want this marriage. What? what are you even saying? Listen to me; I’m not ready for this marriage. Your marriage is in two days, now you are not ready for this marriage? what you mean by that? I don’t know how to explain, But this marriage, just doesn’t feel right. Why are you telling this now? You are ruining my sister’s life. Amulya talk in a lower tone, my parents might listen.. I'm telling you this cos' I thought you'd understand. Understand what? It doesn’t make any sense.. Doesn’t make any sense? - Yes. I can tell the same to Vinni or Vasu.. but I’m telling this to you cos' I thought you'd understand. What should I understand? What would you want me to understand? What are you expecting? If you stop this marriage all of a sudden. Did you think about Aliya’s situation? No Amulya. - Stop it. Stop this childish thinking. How can you be so fickle minded? If something happens now, it’s not only your life; it’s a two family’s issue. Get your head sorted. Don’t ruin my sister’s life. And you know what? The only good decision you took in your life.. ..is this arranged marriage. Because no girl will fall in love with a guy like you. Even if she loves, she wouldn't stay with you for long. [music] What Varun? - Amulya, I’m sorry. I’m very sorry, I should not have spoken like that. I just imagined things and spoke all the possible nonsense.

Waste fellow, you are about to get married in an hour.. ..and now you are with the bride's sister. Are you Emraan Hashmi? Nothing happened, man. Nothing! you're lying even though we saw it with our own eyes. Don't over react, nothing got touched. Are you feeling bad that the lips didn't touch? Do you have sense? Is that detailing important now? Aliya is a nice girl. She is a pure soul. You're lucky to marry her. Stop doing all these before your marriage. Enough. I know that Aliya is a good girl and I'm about to marry her. Don't I know? Everytime I do something, you'll start preaching me. Now, I'll speak and you both listen. Oh. - I'm not at all ready for this marriage. And I don't know anything about her apart from her name. I'll really be a bad husband for her. I agreed for this marriage cos' it makes Amulya happy. Now, I've learned that it's not just me.. even Amulya wouldn't be happy later if I do this. Then for whom should I get married? For whom? Why should I marry cos' of the only reason that some other girl left me? It's such an immature decision. Wow, What an early realization? Disgusting. Hey. Everyone will do mistakes in life. If I repeat the mistake, I'll regret it. Don't quote cinematic dialogues. He'll speak anything, as it worked with Amulya now. It's not about Amulya. I'm just not ready for this marriage. What do you want to do? I'll tell.. ..Amulya's father and stop this marriage. Stop this nonsense and take a deep breath or start meditation from tomorrow onwards. Varun, I will tell you one thing.. These relations will be very sensible. we've to deal carefully. I suggested you as a friend of yours. And it's your wish now. Did you make up these dialogues with in this gap? Won't you cinema guys change? Don't you understand the seriousness here? You know what? I'm done with this wedding. Varun stop. Where are you going? - Hold on.. Listen to me. I'm asking you. - He's gonna screw this. [overlap of voices] Won't you guys listen to me being my friends? Why is he being so stubborn? No, I can't do it. - For the first time, I got connected to his emotion. Varun, listen. - Get lost. Hey.. Hey.. Why are you pulling me? What happened? Err.. I have to tell you something. That something can wait, I have something else to do. Varun, I don't want this marriage. [music] What? [in unison] : What! - I mean, What? Why don't you want this marriage? - Because, I love someone else. You love someone else? - Oh! Yeah.. ..I love Rohit. Hi bro - Him! Here! Subbu. RO-HIT.! He is Rohit. We are in relationship since 3 years. Why didn't you tell me? - Cos' that bitch Subbalakshmi interfered and made us quarrel. so I said yes as I was angry on her. - Oh... ..you said yes cos' you were angry on that person? I'm really sorry, Varun. - Who wants your sorry? You should have said this after our engagement, instead of silly messages. I texted you but you gave a one word reply. Did you ever extend a chat with me? Oh! You came in this way. Hey, What happened to Subbu? What happened? I wasn't able to bear her for 2 weeks atleast. [amused laughter] Our guy, four years. Are jokes important? - No.. no.. I'm really sorry. Varun, do something. Cancel this marriage somehow. Please help Varun.. Please help bro. - Please. Aliya is a pure soul, you're lucky to marry her.
