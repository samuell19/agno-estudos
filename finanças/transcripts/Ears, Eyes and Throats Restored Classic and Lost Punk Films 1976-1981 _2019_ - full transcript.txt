How'd it go? - Okay. - Yeah? I'm supposed to be proud, but I'm really sad. This dancing really mushed to me now. It's like I don't drop a lot of acid... I don't take drugs anymore, I can't. I do acid like once, maybe twice a year. Yeah, I heard Rick is really into it. I'm kind of... I knew it. God damn it, hello. Now that we're seated on leather. Oh, it's leather. Genuine leather. This? No, it's 100% cotton. No, I got it at a... In the beginning was the end: the truth about de-evolution. Have you got the papers the Chinaman gave you? Here it is, dad. - Is this a surprise? - Yes, Booji! In the past this information has been suppressed but now it can be told. Every man, woman and mutant on this planet shall know the truth about de-evolution. Oh dad? We're all DEVO! 1. Wear gaudy colors or avoid display. 2. Lay a million eggs or give birth to one. 3. The fittest shall survive &amp; the unfit may live. 4. Be like your ancestors or be different. 5. We must repeat.

I get in the red. Woke, woke down. Anyway, why did I get in this? Cause all these guys are very attractive. Everybody in the film. Everybody outside the film. You want something? No, I've got my beer. I've got to finish my beer. Well, what's the aesthetic of drinking a beer? That's what I'd like to know. Well, what's the aesthetic of camera noise? Well, at first I was kind of upset. Not really upset, but kind of bummed out because the film that you took of us... Like, he took one really good night there where you could see everything and it was really nice. And then like, the first three nights you filmed of us or something, they were really terrible. Either the sound was really bad, or it was bouncing all over and you couldn't watch anything. Your approach? I know nothing about film... I can't criticize your approach. Yeah, I like to see other people... Like, for a while it was really terrible. No one would ever see... if we were gonna hype ourselves, it was really stuffy, we thought. And then, the press started coming and everything, just like this film. And our tape case. And all my tapes. Tony Dow. And of course... and of course Jerry Mathers as the Beaver. Wait, wait, do that again. That's pretty intelligent. Holidays is a song about getting to a certain level and finding out that circumstances aren't what they appear to be. People aren't what they appear to be. Okay. What did you want to ask? How we got together? Um... I bought this guitar from Sears for seventeen dollars. And I didn't know how to play it, but I was trying to learn. And I would go to the Mabuhay, and tell people that I knew, I could play guitar and I wanted to get a band together. And I was trying to get a band together. And uh... Finally, Jimmy from the Avengers knew a band that wanted a bass player, and he told them to get in touch with me. And I would be willing to learn, but I didn't know how to play. But that, the only way there'd be any music I like is to play it myself. I got thrown out of Inglewood and I came to Santa Cruz cause that's where my parents lived. And I was living there, and I was thinking well I wanted to see a band, there were no bands, there's nothing happening. No one was into the music I was into. It was really a drag, so I thought, "Okay." I'll buy a guitar. And that's when I bought my Sears guitar. So you look, can you see all those people in front? Yeah, I can see it, and I'm part of it. Like, I'll jump off the stage and people will be hitting me and hitting the guitar. And that's part of it, you know? Cause it's great, it's a release, it's like... people are forgetting all about uh... the way they spend most of their day, you know which is in a real routine, even though there's some illusion of of creativity or something if you're in art school or you have a job you like. It's still this routine of fitting into something that's not you. And when people are really going crazy and forgetting like all restraints, that's like the closest people are getting to freedom right now. And maybe we're just a bunch of idiots. It might be true. You know, I'm just doing this cause it's fine. It's... it's exciting. It's not like um... the hardest thing to do. I mean, we've gone through times where we didn't have any money for a long time. Really starving, like we'd get some career job and have some... But that would be more of a sacrifice, than not having food for a while, you know. He was mostly with people like Ricky from The Sleepers and hanging out on Pulp Street at the Raven a lot. And basically trying to get into a lot of trouble. He seemed to really like being notorious, he liked having a reputation of getting into the most fights. He'd run up to some fag on Pulp Street and say, "Faggot, faggot faggot!" and just go wild trying to get this guy to really take him on. Cause Micheal didn't care if he got the shit beat out of him or not. It didn't matter to him. Mostly, he knew that people would not take him up on it, so it didn't matter. The songs were connected with his weird paranoia and his feelings of political jeopardy. The fact that everyone he knew was like gonna be destroyed by a neutron bomb. ...will work with Westing House on contracted through a Swiss corporation who has a middleman who transferred the attache case full of money... I mean, but who actually paid for the contracts, who actually paid for that, you know there's like some big air-conditioned mansion underground in Madagascar where uh... They use Madagascar a lot. No. The pope has an allergy it's one of the few places he escapes it. He felt that he knew so much about like communists, nazis... and all of the government secrets, or a lot of the government secrets that it really was dangerous for him to be around. He felt that he was one of the victims. And eventually they'd uh, catch on to what he knew, or whatever. You know, there was a dog burning in the alley last night. Somebody set a dog on fire. The fire department had to come and put it out. It stunk up the whole neighborhood. I really don't go out very much except for when we're gonna do a gig. It's just not very exciting. The Avengers! It's really a formula now. You go out and act a certain way... and get real fucked up and then you go home, you know. But there's always a lot of new people coming in. All the time. But, it's uh... It's become more diffused and more accepted now. You know, you can see that a lot of money's about to come into it. And it takes away the edge off, it takes the edge off a lot of it. It takes away from a lot of the spontaneity and excitement. People are trying to act like they're right in the magazines. And they don't particularly... know what's going on, and they feed into it. They're just there because it's getting to be a popular thing. It's diffusing and the media's picking it up. It's about to break I think, and become real popular. Let's welcome back the Avengers! We just did some recording for uh, for an EP, we did one song. It was real weird, we were out in the suburbs in this studio. And there were like, there was a yard and butterflies, it was real creepy, and trees and stuff. And we couldn't smoke. Do you think I like to sit around bored? What? I hope you have something different in mind. Do you think I like to sit around bored? After the puke wasn't exactly successful, I just decided, some friends wanted to start a band so... I said, "Good." That's more experience for me playing the drums. We just got started. I like it cause it doesn't have a guitar or a bass. So it's not a traditional arrangement of instruments. Just make as much noise as possible all the time. Keep the beat with one hand and toss in punctuation marks with the other hand. That's about it. I'm still not too coordinated with my feet and with the snare and the bass but practice will fix that. I only heard the first verse. I haven't heard the complete song. I liked it. I thought it was fun. Yeah. Flattering in a sense. It's true, I do just sit there and play the drums. I can't sing so... Just that uh... I would say anything new is intrinsically better than something old simply because it's new. That's why it's called new magazine. And uh, you know, energy as opposed to complexity or technical ability... I get up in the morning and practice for a couple of hours. Then maybe go out and have a couple beers. You know, if there's a concert worth seeing we'll go out to that. Or if we have to play at a party or something, you know, we'll play in the evening. Then sometimes I'll go out and see a movie. Can't use these. Got too many. Even as a trade? Positive. Everybody trades that. Can't. One, two, three, four, five... six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven... It'll be thirteen dollars for these. Only two bucks for Dylan? Yeah. We only sell it for four. I guess I can't do any better anywhere else. Take a trade, cash. Yeah, trade please. Do you have any of these? Yeah, I might have some of these. How is that? Would it be something I would like? Yeah, it's like real um... punk, psychedelic - type thing. - Oh, okay. I just want to make sure I have... 80's version of searching for elevators. Hello. Yeah, there's a party here this Saturday. No, I don't think anybody's gonna play cause the neighbors have been complaining. But um... well, we are playing at the Lion's Lock next Saturday with the Shakes and the Remains. Yeah, I think 2 bucks, yeah. Okay, alright. See you there then. Bye. Gimme a number. Gimme a number. Gimme a number. Gimme a number. Gimme a number. What? Yeah. Yeah, we got it all collated and everything. OK, um... Well, I'll be selling it at Jim's Records is like reopening Saturday. I don't know what time, but sometime in the early afternoon. So I'll be selling them there outside the door if you wanna get one. I'll leave pretty soon. OK. Yeah, I'll probably be there about 1 or so. Alright, OK. See you there. Bye. What do you find to enjoy about loud music that blasts your ears out of the fucking window, and sweating around with a bunch of people who are basically a bunch of shitheads. I like good music. What do you consider good music? I like The Cardboards. The Cardboards, who else do you like? X Respect, Cringe! Cringe, who are the Cringe? Another prog, yeah? What's your opinion on the the United States foreign policy? I have no opinion. I avoid the whole situation. Do you? What do you think about people who avoid political situations? Fantastic. What do you think I would think about me? Here we are. What's the principal trait of your character? My musical talents. How would you like to die? Finally. What do you detest the most? Women. And what do you detest? Men. Oh man, like, like... It's just such a... I mean, like... - I just can't... - What natural gift would you like to have? Uh, I'd like to get some organic granola. Who would you like to be? Um, well... I dunno... Uh, I'm cool, man. What's your favorite thing? Um... hair, man. How much do you weigh? Um, well, when I take my hair off... It's uh... usually boils down 35 pounds. What'd be the height of misery for you? Um, having someone eat my guitar. How long is your dick? Uh, it's... wait, it's... What would you delineate as your faults? Hard to tell. Pretty sketchy. What is happiness in your eyes? - Sex. - Sex? - What is sex in your eyes? - Happiness. What natural gift would you like to have? The natural gift that I'd most like to have - would be that of... - Fast. What do you mean, fast? You have to answer these questions quick. Skip that one, go to the next one. Who would you like to be? Myself. What is your favorite thing? Myself. What is the height of misery for you? Myself. What do you detest the most? Myself. How would you like to die? Probably leaping from the top of a tall building drenched in gasoline and lighting a cigarette very calmly, and then just catching everybody down on the street watching me, and thinking that I was the Human Torch on the way down. But, with my luck I would probably... I'd probably be extinguished by the time I hit the ground and splat. Mhmm. Do you have any tolerance for faults? No. What is your dream of happiness? Being myself. What would be your greatest misfortune? Not being myself. Where would you like to live? Anywhere. Really, any place that I didn't have to pay the rent. Hi. Oh, hi Louise. How are you? How are you? I'm pretty good. I hardly recognized you. You changed your hair. I got bored with it the other way, it was too much. It looks nice. Thank you. Yours does too. You got yours cut too? Yeah, quite a few times. So um, what's new? Not too much. I liked your band. Oh, thank you. You're really good. Especially "Boring," that's my favorite. I couldn't... what is that verse about the gun? Oh... it goes, um... "I want to improve things for everyone" "I want Pittsburgh to be fun" "And if it doesn't happen soon, I might pull out a gun." I really liked that one. Denise wrote the lyrics to it. I helped her out with the lyrics. Very good idea. That's what to write about. Um, so have to met them? Yeah, you should come over. Oh, nice. That'd be really neat. I'd like that. So... This band is really good, huh? Yeah, I really like them. Did you like us tonight? Yeah, you were great. - Oh, thank you. - I couldn't believe it. - What's that, the Cardboards? - Yeah. I can't believe how different you do your drumming. Especially the Vietnam amputee. Oh yeah, the one-handed song? That's incredible. - Thanks. - You'll have to show me a few things. Oh, for sure. You're gonna be playing some drums? Yeah. A few times in a few songs. If there's anything I can show you, I'd be glad to. You can use my stuff to practice with. Oh, that would be really nice. I appreciate that. I'm thinking about picking some drums up myself. What do you detest the most? Strangers. How would you like to die? In bed, dressed in white. White sheets, white walls in the summer time. In my sleep. Do you like sleep? - Yeah. - Why? Dreams. Why do you like dreams? I like them. Elaborate. Why? You never know what's gonna happen next. Isn't that a lot like life? Uhuh. Hi. How are you? Hi. I didn't expect to see you here. I had to come see you. I saw you at the party last night. Yeah, I saw you too. My name is Louise. I'm Bill. Bill Bord. Oh yeah, you play with the Pukes, drums. - You wanna come in? - Sure. I hope the lock works. Alright, come on in. Oh, you have a bike. Yeah, it's not legal, but it's fast. That's all I care about. Ah, neat. I can take you for a ride if you want. Oh, that'd be nice. Have you been to all those concerts? I wish. I just collect the posters. Oh, that's nice. What's that, "Are we not Morgan?" What's a Morgan? That's just, he's just one of my roommates. Oh. Do you wanna take your coat off? You can just throw it on the couch. What's that... embalming diploma? Ah, Morgan. - Would you like a beer? - Oh, sure. Are these your lyrics? Yeah, I just wrote those the other day. Oh, thank you. Yeah, this one goes to the Green Acres theme song. "New York City is the place to be" "CBGBs is the life for me" "Buildings sticking up so big and tall" "Fuck the farm, I wanna go have a ball" Alright. We haven't really worked it out yet. Is this for real? Ah, no. A friend of ours found it in a dark room. We're just gonna use it as a promo shot. Oh, that's very neat. Um, let me show you around the place. OK. This is our graffiti room. That's a band from LA called The Screamers. - Caught them when they were here. - Oh really? - Were they here? - Yeah. Here's some lyrics from a band called the Cardboards. That's a title of a song by the Apes of God. You have a lot of bands here, huh? - Yeah, we try. - That's neat. Whoever's around. I never saw graffiti in an apartment before. It just sort of developed over the years. Well... These are my drums. I'm working on building up a set. Yeah, I think I saw you play these ones at the Decade. That's how I remember what band's playing. That used to be my only drum. This used to be my only drumstick. I'm improving. Alright. Let me put a record on. - Oh, do you have X-Ray Spex? - Yeah. Oh, good. I really like Poly Styrene. Yeah, she definitely makes the band. Yeah. - Good voice. - For sure. Good stage presence from what I've seen too. Come outside, let me show you my other motorcycle. This is my other bike. I use it for spare parts. It's a psychedelic cycle. Yeah, used to be some kind of metal... Yeah, mixed and matched here. Fancy. I kinda like you. I like you too. Yes, it is a nice bike, Thanks. Perhaps we can lie? Sure. On the bed? We'd like to thank the jukebox for a reasonably good rendition of the music of the 70s. We'd like to sing some more music of the 80s. Hey, yo! Play some more, man.
