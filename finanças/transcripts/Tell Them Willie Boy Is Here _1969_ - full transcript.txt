Have you seen this crazy of Calvert ! Ate his dust. When did you come, Willie Boy ? By train 5-h. You are going to the party ? This is where you're going, Tom ? I am Calvert for the tow if it was pouring. I'm going with you. Feast of the Indian Reserve Always in the cows, Willie ? No. We said you are working in a ranch. The boss was white. Indeed. And you are gone ? Her husband came home. Why look for trouble ? They are part of you. I am not worth it. Are you talking about... Here are the troubles that are coming... my father and My brothers. See you in the orchard of Calvert. Midnight. Midnight ? "You must come. I've already warned. I will kill him. You don't believe me, Willie Boy ? So, Mike, I believe you. The last time, I removed. Today, I give you the request. I can't hear what you say. Damage. Use and spin. It is not there to preach. What do you do with these bigots ? You are converted ? Always your old juice of snake ? No. A good whisky for a white man. I the wood with confidence. I have not done it, I stole it. - You're buyer ? - I'm waiting to see its effects. How much ? A dollar. Dirty Indian. You've put the time, sheriff ! I have called twice ! Three men for selling whiskey to my Indians. This are White. Lead me, Chinese. It is like that we should be born. A lot of money and morgue. Anything to itself, what. This officer has the most beautiful legs I have ever seen. A pity that she does not love you, Coop. There is gold in these hills. I will rely on, Ray. Sheriff... I want to hunt discreetly with these people. It is a federal reserve. Purge-the. It is an order. - I don't know you. - I am Sam Wood. Come down from there. I have forbidden to sell alcohol to the Indians. I thought you had always Cotton, sheriff. What are you laughing ? Excuse me. How much ? One closes. How much ? Two money. We will enjoy a small squaw this evening, Willie Boy ? We are going to do the wedding ? He did not seem to appreciate. That to me is equal. Firm all. You go to see the parade in Riverside ? I don't care much to see the President Taft ! The President will not appreciate. I don't care well ! He made a special chair to fit the 140-kg. You find it democratic, to spend our money as well ? What do you mean ? Has there ever spent a dollar for me ? Democracy, it is to let it run this Indian as if the country was still in him. This is their democracy ! The real democracy ! That is a small part ? I offer 25 cents stake. Ten cents ? I am even willing to play for 2 cents. Go back to your Reservation ! Outside ! I'm not going to spend my night to keep you. Filez ! This is to act in true White, sheriff. Co-op ! I have trouble with an Indian. Well, empty-the. This is Willie Boy ! It is armed ? Not noticed. You help me really. Willie shot himself. So. Tells... My bar is not a morgue ! You would have been able to put down ! Go complain in the morning. Stop it now ! The dirty Red has wanted to kill me ! Where is he believed ? I bleed ! He wanted to kill me ! You would not have missed. That is what you come to do here, Willie ? Where the old Mike's range-there's a litter ? Behind the wash-house, after the olive trees. You want to pieuter here. Maybe. You are returned to Nevada ? It is said that I got lost en route. Yeah. This is what we said. The fast midnight that file on El Paso. You have a blanket in too ? Why not ? Finished-the. Next, Charlie. I don't want you, this evening. It does not prevent me from being there. Let me enter. What you say does not count, and you know it. Let's go... Open to me. You're going to hang out here until that you have enough to pamper these Indians. Then you will leave also. In Europe, perhaps. You look for someone else to save them. What is my role in all of this ? You just want me to say "I love you" or nonsense of the same kind. Words that are enough for your happiness... Very little for me. You can't even open his eyes. And you're the doctor. For you, a man, it is a body to dissect. You can't make anyone happy. You can't even be a killer of Indians, like your father... All you know how to do, to humiliate me ! You can always say no. How do you resist ? You are brutal, harsh, violent, like a wolf in a cage. I use thee in my way. If you weren't a idiot, you would have understood. To which te do you take ? For Elisabeth Arnold anthropologist, and doctor ! And you, who are you ? You ought to see your face, in the fight lit up with joy. A joy vulgar and stupid... Love me ? But you don't even know what that means... I could teach in Nevada. Have my school to me. You might be able to take a ranch. I left your father to drive me out to the gun because of you. I have requested in the manner of the Whites. I have requested to the manner of the Indians. And he chased me out to the rifle shots. I shall put up not that long ago. Or, neither of you. Frank, I need a coroner. Who was it killed ? An Indian. The killer has kidnapped his daughter. What is the fool who did it ? An Indian. I like better it ! I am with Dr. Arnold, the officer of the Reserve of Morongo. I send you a coroner. Suits me it before Washington gets in the way. Heard. Put a militia on the hunt... It will serve as body guards to the President ! What do you say to that ? Ray Calvert with you ? We will take my car. It is necessary to bring back Lola. I know that she does not want to live in squaw. She has already ran away with Willie. Our mother has told Lola to follow Willie. It is the old custom Paiute. It is called "marriage by capture". The mother bowed before the tradition. I want Lola to return to its true place here. What do you say, Ray ? We are dedicated 24 hours, prior to Riverside ? Why not ? Agree, co-Op. That took Willie, share a weapon ? I'm going to wander off on Palm Springs. You wouldn't have had to shoot. He was going to kill him. What are we going to do ? Don't worry. Don't be sad. I hated it not. Anyway, we always end up dying. They will not take us. They try not even. Nobody is interested in the acts of an Indian. Person. I'm not going to hurt. You might want to flee. You still have fear. Why would I want to get away ? Off-me ! If they approach, I will shout. I would call it ! I shall stay forever with you. I will always try to save me. Off-me ! You want to spin ? File. As you say, Chinese ? This is the dress that she wore leaving... according to her mother. He has chosen the difficulty. Barefoot through the mountain. There should be more traces. Here ! They have handed over their shoes here. Palm Springs. It is at present. What feed do they have on us ? Three or four hours. I don't believe it. What ? It has nothing to expect of the poor buggers in Palm Springs. It is up to the 29 Palm trees that he would find help. It should spin towards the pass. The signs don't lie, Op. I have spent my life to read them with your father. These signs indicate Palm Springs. They are necessarily passed through there because of the fire. I take the Chinese. We meet at the pass. Smoke... Wait for me here. You should wait ! What does it do ? Wait. We crossed the Morongo. He has not followed. He took the pass. He walks to the flair. He doesn't really know that it is there. It is not certain. It may be a camp of conveyors ? They are unaware that you are continuing. Conveyors not squatting not as well. Co-op was able to sniff out the coup. It is the militia. I lost two hours to want to lead astray. I tell you retards, huh ? Maybe. I flee to thee. You're not too bad, at least ? It was cavalé all the day, sheriff... Found something ? No, Ira. We. It will soon be night. No one will be able to see him, but him not. Your belly is cue to a hundred meters ! I don't think Willie is in the corner. I am simply giving my opinion. It's not worth anything. I was just telling our hunt for the Comanches, with your father. It has brought back six scalps, this time. It was the right time, then... Despite the fights and the rest. In the morning, the tipis were gleaming in the sun. Forget it all and cover the most ground possible. I think it's going to go. You will be able to move. They go off to ? It will pass when the mist will be thicker. We can no longer be taken by the desert. They are too close. We will stop in a hut. Then, we'll go to the Mount of Ruby. You must walk throughout the night. And all the day also. I didn't think they wanted me at this point. Maybe they like me. It is you they want. The woman, a medical doctor is aware of ? Thou hast spoken of our plans to leak ? She wanted me to be a teacher. For teaching lies ? And remain old girl ? And put a sheriff in his bed ? We have never slept in a bed. Déchausse yourself. And remember... You're not a teacher. If you walk on a cactus, remember that you are my wife. Disperse you. Disperse you. Do not shoot ! I think I got it. The blood... The blood of four legs, silly ! It could have been one of us... or the girl. - I heard move, I've pulled ! - Bah ! This is only the beginning. Man ! You would have killed in cold blood ! Calm yourself, Charlie. I thought you liked Willie. We can't track down a man in half. Why has he joined us ? Willie was not even armed, at the beginning ! I do not let myself not lynched by a dirty bouseux ! Nor even by you, any judge that you are ! Going to prepare to eat, Charlie. You should return this boy. You are not yet a mayor, Judge. You run, just like Willie. It happened here, it was not long ago. It will get tired so ever ? It's all over for me. Continue without the carriage. Tom will attach itself to Warren's Well. I will send him men and supplies. Do you kill and especially not to the task. Turn flange at the border of the County. Come on, Ray, we should go to Riverside. You can see a Chair all day. Just a minute. This militia is good for nothing. They will never take Willie. This affair is not our concern. Then, leave it alone. I want to continue a little bit. I'm starting to take a liking to it. Your father was lucky. He died at the right time. Do as you like. They are near ? I would like to water. You get. You will have all your drunk. While on the road. It's going to. You can blow a little. I thought I would get married at the church of Morongo. In white dress. To 29 Palms, you will find my cousins. It will be up to them to see. If they help us, so much the better. If not, I'll manage alone. All to me is equal. Dr. Arnold could help us. She has the kind of it. It would help us. Maybe, she could fix everything if... if you did a little prison. I've already made a little prison. For drunkenness, in San Bernardino. They kept me 30 days in a cell. A large cell such as a hole in a coyote. I had the number 273 on my photos. I don't want you to go in jail ! I was eating out of a bowl. As a guard dog. Day and night, I dreamed of these mountains. And you. An Indian dies quickly in prison. It is not made for it. What have I done, to die in a prison of White ? What have we done, the rest of us ? What wrong have we ? No. Nothing that the color. Willie, you're gonna kill ? - If you need to. - How so ? If they continue. The Whites we will continue to always. Always is less long than you think. You have no chance against them. Maybe. Maybe. But they will know that I existed. They are coming from. Climbs. Climbs ! They were able to go through with it. Beyond the source. I'm going to move forward. If it is there and if it fires, hide you in speed. Willie will not shoot at me ! What is it that makes you believe this ? If he refuses to recognize you ? We are old buddies. This is my cover that serves as their bed. You want them to make ? Of course. Let me go see if he is up there. Be careful, in case he has forgotten your beautiful friendship. This is Charlie Newcombe. If there is a reward, He may want a guitar that new. It has the air to go. We will gallop up to the source. The beasts were dying of thirst. Covers-us, Johnny. Willie may be there. It is a risk to run, Judge. If there is, it will be. Otherwise, we will have water. He killed my horse ! Shake you, damn it ! Shoot ! You could achieve Warren's Well ? It's been a ride. Go for it ! Tell them to alert the sheriff ! File, Johnny ! Tell them that we are the only survivors ! And that the place is full of Indians ! We made this chair for the President, and it is awfully excited. Taft is the first President to come to us. And the bigger. Can we know the exact volume this special chair ? Here is the schedule for tomorrow. We will finish by a great banquet. A procession of 15 cars will pick up the President. He will unveil a plaque to Father Serra. And for the Institute Sherman. Then, reception of the veterans of the army. And then, back to Colton to put it in the train. The security of the President... The drama of Buffalo will not happen here ! You fear an attack ? Sheriff Cooper had to leave a dangerous man-hunt to ensure that on the President. We will hold in-person. Finally the new ! Can we say that you are suspicious body guards federal ? I didn't say anything. And he did not say that. The guards federal, have not prevented the assassination of McKinley. Anyone can kill a President. It is enough to want it really. In the East, it knows nothing about the weapons. Here, we learned how to use it to live. This city will not see an assassination of a presidential decree. Let's go to the apartment. At the bar, rather. The fruit juices are free of charge. And Wilson offers the bourbon. What is the poor man that you hunt, sheriff ? This is Willie Boy, a tough. It has already been in prison. Excuse me. A word to say at the reception. I am in your war-paint. They help more willingly to someone of their world. And you're their world. When did you arrive ? Yesterday evening. - What happened ? - Nothing. Lola is always with him ? It has all the air. 12 riders have not been able to catch up with an Indian on foot ? For the time being. I like it. I have dinner with them. You join us ? No. I take a glass with the press. I take a drink, that's all. Yes, of course. What is your room number ? Good evening, deputy sheriff Cooper. Enter, Mr. Dexter. Be my host. I would like to ask you a few questions. Instead, take a cup. You intend to speak to the President in the case of Morongo. This is a postpone ill-informed. There has been a murder. And the militia is on the hunt. The sheriff feared for the life of the President. - Who said it ? - Wilson. This is not the good sheriff. The sheriff Cooper doesn't say anything. Because you choose wrong your questions. Excuse me for a moment. Go. Immediately. What are you doing here ? I'm waiting for you to come put you to bed. I you use ? - No, thank you. I'm a little tired, excuse me. One last question... With your science of the country, do you believe that the case of Willie Boy... There is no case of Willie Boy. I just want to make sure I the first to hear about the news. Even if there isn't it ? Affected. What kind of man is this renegade Indian ? What do you mean by renegade ? Renegade compared to what ? Hello, Mr. Dexter. Guests are asked to enter immediately. The president is seated, we will never admit to anybody. Go To Dr. Arnold. Go, I pray you. You've had your minute with the President ? Two. It brought me back to his office of Indian Affairs. And his deputy is considering to put a man in my place. And hiking the presidential, how was it ? Dusty. Cute hat... Bad news. The Paiutes attacked the militia. - How do you know ? - How does it ! I received the telegram. How many victims ? Ray Calvert is dead. These assholes journalists are hanged the phone. It is in a beautiful mess ! And these guys that whistle all my whisky ! Riverside is it threatened ? And the train is presidential ? 200 Indians think they will be able to overthrow the government ? - Where is the Mount of Ruby ? - Has its usual place. It is well affected ? The ball broke the handcuffs he was wearing. He bursts into the spine. The journey till here has not arranged. I look forward to having it put in the hospital. It will be released ? It will take a lot of luck. Where are the others ? Johnny had a fall. He was referred back to Bannings. And the Chinese ? Back to Morongo. A message from sheriff Wilson for you. You send four snipers and the press. All the militias in the region are by road. Indian troops reported in the desert. You found tomorrow at the Rock Corral. Answer I file. Where are you, sheriff ? I'm here, Ray. Me too. For a moment, I thought you were your father. I am thirsty, Coop. Willie does not kill the horses to ensure his escape. Ray was hit by accident. He was standing, firing blindly. Seen other Indians ? We haven't even seen Willie. I picked up Ray and I took it. You come with me ? Why not ? I do not want me to meddle in it. If it continues, it will kill it for good. And all the fibs will become true. You will not have Willie. It is a real cloud. I would have had to stop it immediately. Before he kills Mike. But I felt like you. I had to stay with the militia. For a time I had a job ! It is still not worth it you will do it ! You and the sacred Indians ! Your sermons to the nuts ! I know where it's going, and I will get it. It is to me. The old have left me all their money. The other had to force them to leave. It has everything to present. The rifle your father. Fifteen dollars of the old. The colt from my uncle. And the shirt of my father. Make a small fire. I'm going to look for the horses. You thought it would help us here. I made a mistake. You have been able to deceive you about everything. Maybe... You can't admit your wrongs. There's something ? Nothing that the dog. Put a man over with horses. This dog is not a bloodhound, co-Op. He is only interested in rabbits. In 30 years, I have not had a trouble with the Indians. With the Mexicans and the rattlesnakes, yes. To say that Calvert has been taken because of an Indian bazaar ! My father is killed by a thief, drunk-dead. An Indian Man ? Half-and-half. It doesn't make sense. It is not made for it. What is wrong with you ? I am ready to die for you, and you are not. I'm ready to kill for you, and you not. I told you that they we have not. So, why are you hiding ? Co-op is there. In Newman, with his men. And we are stuck here ! I have neither horses, nor you. If I stay with you, you will die. What to do, Willie ? That is going to happen ? I don't know. They will kill them. This would be a good thing. You could go back with them. I would have been able to kill them all. But I only killed their horses for thee to keep. Because of this killer of Calvert, they... do we fail more. You are afraid of ? You want to go ? Well, goes. Go for it, of course. They are two steps. Tell them Willie Boy is here ! I don't want you to die. I can't live without you. I don't want you to die. I will not leave you ever. I'm your wife. There were traces near the horses. And on the roof also. I thought good to warn you. - We can ask for reinforcements. - Not yet. I'm going to go around the hill with Harry. If there is a ruckus, get all the men. If I see nothing, I will draw 5 shots spaced. Same signal for you. And if you gut it with a knife ? You will hear me bitching. Dead for a long time ? No. Removes this horse from there. Why kill themselves ? She may not be killed. This is the revolver ? A single shot fired. Will prevent as it is on the trail of Willie. If he had remained in the corner ? I've already looked at, figure-toi ! An ambush by stalking, that's enough. Will stand in the way of Bullion with your men. He goes there ? Possible. Otherwise, I'm on his trail. It will jam between us. I will go alone. If you do reviews, not tonight, let it go. I do not understand. She had done nothing. She had no reason to die. Do prepare a coffin at the ranch. She did not look dead. It won't last. It brings back Lola. Co-op was found dead. He stalks Willie. How is it dead ? A ball. Open the. I am a doctor. It was found like that. With his business around it. How has this happened ? It is not known which of the two has done it. She smiled. This simply means it is time to go to ground. We are going to join the militia. They are aware of ? We sent them someone. Why does he do that ? It is once again a true Indian. We do not let his wife in the hands of the enemy. They had no enemies. I believe that she killed herself. To facilitate his escape. Dr. Arnold ! This is Willie and the sheriff. The horse co-Op has lost an iron. Impossible. Co-op has remained around 29 Palms. Willie returns to the Mount of Ruby. These are their traces. They date back to yesterday evening at the latest. Are you sure ? I am sure of it. Perhaps Willie has it ceased to flee. Will prevent the sheriff Wilson. One goes to the Mount of Ruby. Willie... You can return it if you want. There... here. Bury-the. I left him his luck. He didn't want them. He had more ammunition. Who told you to incinerate ? Co-op was told to bury it. That we are going to show people ? People always want to see something ! You may say that it has no more memories.
