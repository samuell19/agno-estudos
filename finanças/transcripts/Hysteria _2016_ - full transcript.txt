HYSTERIA This is the living room. It has great space and well, the view is spectacular. How old is it? Thirty, thirty five years. But it's in great condition. The ceilings are typical English style. It's lovely. And honestly, it's at an excellent price. Is there anyone else interested? Four people are willing to give the advance payment already. This is the basement, which you can use as a storeroom or as a playroom for when you have children. I love it. Well, yes, it's very nice. But? We would have to ask for a bank loan. We'd be paying the same we're already paying for rent. It means debt for ten years. But for something that's ours. Honey, it's our estate. This is for us and for our children. And, the house is lovely. Huh? Come. Say yes, my kitten. Huh? Meow? Meow. Careful, careful there! Pull. Push! Get to work! -Where does this go, ma'am? -In the basement. And be careful with the walls, okay? Let me do it, sir! Oh! Careful! Be careful with my furniture! You're pushing it onto my banister. Well then pull it to the left, and bring it up, if you will! Bring it up! Pull! Pull! There. What happened? Your husband just...! I'm telling him to let us work, but he continues meddling! -You should've paid attention. -It was unintentional. I've been telling you to be careful for days, and you don't give a shit! -Honey. -Look, ma'am... Listen! I'm taking it off from your salary. He was not responsible. Damn it! Don't defend them! How will we fill all this space? Just wait until the baby is born. It'll soon be full of toys. The baby will be jumping on the bed crying: "Mom, dad, can I sleep with you?" Come, my kitten. What's up, my man? Cheers! Toast with us, dick! What's happening? Some guys out here. Tell them to leave. It's really late and they're annoying. They'll leave in a bit. Will you help me with the door, honey? Yes. Good luck. Wait. Wait. No eating out. -Leave it in the car, all right? -Uh-huh. At the conference, the official reported there were 28 bodies found in clandestine graves in diverse states of decomposition. Although these corpses were all incinerated, and their identity remains unknown. According to the information, Police acted jointly with organized crime. The World Health Organization reported that the death toll by Ebola rose to 3,439 people out of the 7,492 contagion cases. The first case of Ebola diagnosed in the United States, the Liberian Thomas Duncan, remains in critical state. Atlas won in the classic match... Good morning to all. Good morning. This is architect Federico Anduaga, who even when it's not evident, studied in London, he has worked in several firms as a designer. -He's very talented. -Thank you. And he's gay. Let's give him a big applause. I'm kidding, my man! The architect here is going to lead the most important project of our construction firm: the residential condos in the State of Mexico. An applause, please. Giddy up! Excuse me. These motherfuckers are like cattle. One has to herd them. You've got to let them know you're the authority. You are the boss now. Speed up with the numbers, you're coming with me to see the investors. Yes, sir. -Congratulations, and welcome. -Thank you. Yes? Architect? Your wife. Thank you. How did it go? Very well. I have my own office. Hmm, let's make some good use of it. Listen, I don't know what to get for your father, a tie or a chain-watch? I fear he'll think we can't afford anything else if we get him a tie. -I've got to go, honey. -Don't forget the dinner party. No, honey. Bye. Anduaga, this is engineer Leonardo Guerrero. A pleasure, chief. The engineer has been in this corporation for many years. And he's advised all of our architects. He'll be your right hand from now on. Whatever you need, chief. Seriously, whatever, you count on me. Thank you very much. We're betting everything on you, Anduaga. You'll see, in a year time we'll be driving big pickup trucks. Giddy up! In your birthday We're gladly singing to you. Wake up, dear Rafa. Wake up. Look, dawn has already come -And the little birds... -Enough! Thank you. Guess what I got for your father? Tell them, sweetheart. A trip to Japan! We've got something for you too. Congratulations, dad. A tiny detail only. Give me a bigger slice. Sugar, Rafa. I don't give a shit about sugar! Give me a bigger slice! Nasty losers demonstrating again. If I had a handgun, I'd go out and kill them all. Don't talk like that, Rafa. We have another surprise for you. We're going to have a baby. No! Babies! -Yes. -How thrilling! How will you maintain a child? He's now hired, at a construction company. Honey. You'd better not screw it up. Not a word? Damn it, why are you so soft, huh? He always treats you with insults and scorn. And you let him. He enjoys your misery. I don't know how you can take him. I would have already told him to go fuck himself. His illness has not been easy. Calm down! Fucking pussy! Come, motherfucker! What, dude? -What are you doing? -I saw another spot. This is our spot! I will not allow a bunch of nasty losers to park in my spot! Why spark them off, honey? Either you send them off or I will. Hey, motherfucker, you spilled the booze on me! -Good evening. -Evening. Um, could you please let me park here? This is my spot. -You live here? -Yes. This house was abandoned, buddy. We've just moved in. How cool's the diggings? How much did you pay for it? Two, three mill? I'm talking to you. Don't fuck around. Hey! Move away or I'll call the police! Easy, ma'am. I said move away, motherfucker! Let's go with Chuki, bro, that dude is on for heavy blows. Evening. Away, my boys. Get up, fucker! Let's go! Let's go! Bye! Bye! What's up, buddy? Bye! See you around, man. Come, sweetheart. Don't let those fools drain you. Come. Relax. No. Easy. Easy. What's wrong? Not now. Five thousand pesos for ready-mix concrete? We're 60 percent above real cost. -It's more than inflated. -The boss has authorized it. I won't sign this. Listen to me, chief. I've been working here for many years. But this is fraud. As long as I'm here, I will not allow this kind of irregularities. Write the real numbers. -Chief, remember we've got... -I won't say it again. Leonardo. I'm passing it this time, but the next one, I'll file a lawsuit. It's important to take folic acid, and avoid vigorous physical activity. It's a tiny bean. Can you hear that? It's the heartbeat. The key with gringos is to give them a few tequilas and when they're a little warmer show them the numbers. Welcome my friends! How are you? -How do you do? -Hey, Ramiro! -Timothy. -Federico. These are my friends forever, Tim and Esteban. -Steven, Steven. -Nice to meet you. Federico Anduaga. Can I bring you something to drink? A round of tequilas, sweetie. No, no, no, just water for us. Just water. Thank you. Thank you. -Careful. -Thank you. These are chiles en nogada, they're really good. Yes, we already know chiles en nogada, we've been making deals with Mexicans for many years. Well then, cheers. Cheers. We find you project really interesting, Mr. Anduaga. -Thank you. -You're very talented. We hope the numbers are as attractive as the design. Teotihuacan means "The land of Gods." Oh, man, big pyramids. Next time, I take you there. Ramiro, can we get down to business? We want to see the numbers. Well, then. First of all, I'd like to tell you that this is quite an innovative design. The architect here, despite not having so much experience, has come up with a first-class design. The initial investment might seem excessive, but we're all taking risks here. Ramiro, the numbers. The numbers. At last! Ramiro, these have been your best numbers. It's a deal. Monday you'll have half the money in your account. -Congratulations. -Thank you very much. No, no, no, no, no. This is not the amount. What? This is not the cost! If you're not sure about your numbers, we rather invest with another company. No, no, no, no. Give us a minute. Miss? Two tequilas, please. What did you do, fucker? You changed the numbers! You are a damned stupid animal! You're an imbecile, son of a fucking bitch! Do you know how many people are involved in this? We're going to lose this project! Do you know how much time we've invested in this shit? Fucking shit! I have to dish out 30 million! So you better raise this building with what's left without those, or I'll make sure nobody ever hires you again! I'll make sure you earn no more fucking money for the rest of your miserable life! Who is it? Who's that? Who's that? Oh, damn it! Don't do that! You scared me! Say something when you arrive. -Federico? -Huh? What's that? There's somebody downstairs! They've broken in! Turn the light on! Miss? It's an emergency, somebody's broken into our house! Open up or I'll give you fucking hell! They're opening the door! Help us! -We've called the police! -It's Niño de Jesús, number 29. In San Pedro Martir. Let's go, man! Get away! Run! Okay. They're gone. There are quite a lot of home break-ins in that area, madam. It's difficult to proceed in these cases. If there was proof... They broke into our house! What more proof do you need? Well, who was it? Who should I arrest? -You tell me. -I saw one of them. -Can you describe him, sir? -Yes. Dark skin, about 14 years old. He was about 5 foot 2 or 5 foot 4. Any defining features? Yes, he was limping. I'm going to draw up a record, and we'll be sending a police car to patrol the area so you may feel at ease. All right? TOP SECURITY Give me your phone. You'll receive the image with this App. Do you think that's enough? I hope so. Otherwise, we get a handgun. One of ours had his eyes ripped off and was skinned, because when they took him, he spat on his face. After hearing all this, don't you feel like going out to the streets and figure a way to end with all this violence? We are experiencing the worst violence crisis yet in the history of this country. Barbarity and savagery are the appropriate nouns for what's happening and the government doesn't seem to care. What we see is the horror they'd been trying to conceal... Why didn't you tell me the numbers were already approved? Of course I told you, chief. But you insisted on changing them. Why then didn't you warn me! I'm sorry. We need to adjust costs. There are certain things in which we can retrench, chief. I have a buddy in a construction firm who undersells their surplus materials. I can't work like this. Hey! Hey! Pussy. Hey, fucker! They're going to see you. Look at them, they're like beasts. Federico, get away from there. The police. What are they doing? Right, fucker! Bring it on! Let's see. We're going to change the column frame. Instead of using number 8 rebar, we'll be using number 6. And we're placing the stirrups every 12 inches. We will not insulate the walls, and the finishing works are going to be changed. Listen, architect, no engineer, as stupid as he might be, would make himself responsible for this. If I called Civil Protection System, your building permits would be canceled, and you'd end up in jail. But if you're interested, I can get the signature from another engineer. You'd just have to arrive to a nice agreement. Ready, sir. So with these they can no longer break in? If I were you, I wouldn't be so sure. Look who's been locked in now. You know? I think they should grab all the miserable burglars, put them against the wall and shoot the hell out of those motherfuckers. You know why there are no burglars in Arabia? Because they cut their hands off there. That's why I always bring my cutie with me, in case some dickhead wanted to play smart on me. I fuck him up! It's ready. Come in! Did you call me, sir? Take a sit, Anduaga. I went over the advances. And I must confess... You've understood the hell out of it! That's it, architect! You see how easy it was? So, we're going to begin the construction now. You'll have to go to Toluca to supervise it, huh? But for now, relax and go celebrate. Hell yes, chief! Let's go for some drinks! -I can't. -Don't tell me she scolds you? No. So? Come on! Some other day. You need to relax, chief. You're very tense. Don't be afraid of your lady, you'll be back soon. There was this motherfucker in high school that delighted in fucking around with me. He always came with his guys and beat the hell out of me. They burnt my books. He once even... peed on my schoolbag. One day, I found him alone. I took a tube, and slam! I fucking blew it on his face. And I fled. After a while, this dude still didn't come to school. I thought I'd killed him. Weeks later... he arrived with an eye patch. Nobody ever messed with me again. You're fucking great, chief. Don't let anyone come telling you what to do. Have you seen what time it is? Why did you turn off your phone? Do you think it's not evident? Where were you? Hey! I'm talking to you! You're overbearing. What? I'm sick of your limiting me and of your need to control me! I will arrive whenever I want and do what my fucking balls wish! Stop bugging the crap out of me! I said no! I will not allow a cheap bricklayer telling me what to do! -Hello? - Federico? -What is it? -Your dad had a cardiac arrest. Thank you. Do you want something to eat? No, thanks. Are you okay? We were talking about the trip. I hadn't seen him so thrilled in a long time. I don't want to compare myself to your mother, but... Your father is what's most important to me. You have to eat, dad. Okay then. I'll bring you clothes. I won't take long. Sit down. Your mother was too condescending with you. You were always too nice. That's why everybody takes advantage of you. You've got to be stronger. Don't be such a moron! Please forgive me for having spoken to you in that way. I don't want us to be angry at each other. But you've been behaving strangely. Is there anything you want to say? Don't do it again. Let us praise our Lord's grace and pray for him to have mercy on this soul, forgive all his sins, open a path for him onto the heavens, and share his eternal light with him. May he rest in peace. In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. Hey, motherfucker! Quit it, man! Faggot. What! Motherfucker! You're an idiot, kiddo! What happened? What happened? Hey! Beat it, sons of your fucking bitches! You beat it to damn hell if you don't want me beating the hell out of you! Careful, brother. No problem, man. Fine. Let's go. Take the bricks off! Take them off! Hurry! -Done. -What happened? The wall came down. I told you it was not plumb! -Bring it up! Bring it up! -He's out! No, architect, the slab warped. This material is not holding up, we need to change it. No! It will be done as you were told! And whoever doesn't like it, can just go to hell! Okay, for the architect who brought this project to a successful conclusion! Cheers. Cheers, chief. Look at those babes. They sure ride it every day. Hell yes. Look at those sucking little mouths. Imagine, sucking their coochies. What are you doing, Anduaga? Have your drink, man. She has him marching to her tune. Hello? Hi. What is it? I'm afraid of sleeping alone. I just have to finish this, okay? And if you go somewhere else? Where to? I don't know. A hotel. I'd like you to be here with me. By the way, it's a baby girl. Hello? Yes, here I am. Sorry for my interruption. I hear you're a stud, huh? You fucked two whores in one night! Who would have guessed? So quiet and so enterprising. All right then, let us go for some whores. I'm going back to the hotel. No body´s shipping out! Or, what? Don't you like ladies? Don't be a faggot! I said no! Oh! You scared me. What time is it? I'm sorry. I don't know what came into me. Open it. For the baby. "There was once a lady who was the worst lady on Earth. She was as fat as a hippo, she smoked cigars, and had two sharp and shiny canines. Besides, she wore sharp end boots, and had long and spiky nails with which she liked to scratch people. She would hit her five children when they got bad grades in school, and also when they got good grades. It's an earthquake. It's an earthquake! Hello? Yes, one second. From the office, It's urgent. Hello? What? Yes? -I'm on my way, where are you? Oh, no, don't come around here. Don't come near here. It's a fucking mess, fucking bad! -Okay, where do I meet you? -Hold on! At the parking lot, next to our offices. I'll see you there. Okay. I'm already here. Where are you? It's bad. It's fucking bad. -What did Ramiro say? -You can imagine. He's now with the lawyers. Did they say anything about the materials? No, not yet. What should we do? They're investigating everyone. No, It can't be! Damn it! It can't be! I advise you, chief, to go home and stay there for a while, until things have settled a bit. But it was not my fault. I was just doing my work. I know, I know, I know, chief. But they'll try to find someone to blame. The recently inaugurated apartment building in the State of Mexico suffered a collapse due to the earthquake this morning. The National Seismological Service... Federico? Informed that the earthquake reached 7.2 degrees in the Richter scale. What's going on? And it lasted approximately one minute. Material losses are estimated in 130 million pesos, plus the damages to nearby estate. At his press conference, the Mayor gave the following statement. We will proceed with the full rigor of law. The Attorney General's Office will use all the research tools at their disposal. The legal representatives from this corporation have already had contact with the Attorney General... to ensure the entire provision of compensation. This entails all the victims and property damage. We'll dig deep on the building's security protocols... This investigation is a preemptive approach to prosecute all potential parties liable. The expects are already working on site. What happened? What? These investigations take a long time. They're going to take witness statements, make an endless number of experts' reports. The basic thing here is that nothing gets connected with you, that your name simply does not appear. Thank you, Aaron. The only thing we can do is waiting. I would recommend you not to leave home for a good while. I understand. So 50 percent prior to the surgery, and the rest at discharge. Okay. I'll talk it over with my husband. Thank you. Bye. Federico? Open the door! Open the door! Open it, damn it! Enough! Open it! It's not fair! No! What are you doing? No! No! What's wrong with you? Where are you going? To get some money. We owe the mortgage, we have to pay the advance to the hospital. And for all I know, you don't give a shit! -No, wait! -May I? -It's not my fault. -Let go of me. Sonia. You don't know how I feel. Do you know how I feel? I've been here for a month, locked in, waiting, bearing all of this. I don't know who you are anymore. It's been enough. No, Sonia! Sonia! This morning, engineer Leonardo Guerrero appeared before the prosecutor and declared against architect Federico Anduaga. He is blamed for siphoning off money, and for the irregularities found in the materials used for building the residential condos in the State of Mexico. Architect Anduaga began unlawfully siphoning off money since the beginning of the construction. Is there a precise sum? Some 20 to 30 million. How come did no one realize it until now? The architect forged signatures, bought invoices, blackmailed several people to get the permits, and committed all kinds of unlawful actions to cover his fraud. So what's to be done in this case? Well, we've already presented proof to the Attorney, and the Public Ministry has issued the arrest warrant, we're waiting for the judge's resolution. -Thank you very much. -Sure. Listen, you can't come in. Security! Security! Son of a bitch! I'm going to kill you, motherfucking shitty thief! Son of your fucking bitch! You don't know who you messed up with, son of a bitch. I'll see that you get locked in for life, motherfucker! If you ever come near here again, I'll cut your balls off, and open you up as a miserable pig! Take him out! Fuck you, son of a bitch! You are a moron. A useless piece of shit. Motherfuckers, I'm sick of you! You fucking scum! I wish you were dead, you dogs! Fuck! You are a dickhead. Toño! Toño! Come here, motherfucker! Let go of me, motherfucker! That's it, you son of a bitch! Let go of me! Help me! Rana! Let go of me, motherfucker! Let go! -Let me go! -Fuck you! -Let go of me! -Nasty dumb ass! You wanted to fuck me, motherfucker? -You fuck yourself! -Stop! Stop! Stop! Fucker! No! No! No! You smell like shit! You think you're too clever? Fucking people up? Huh? You think you're a big dick? You're just an animal! People like you make this country a piece of shit! You make me sick! All of you! I can't stand your eyes. Your laughter... Your teeth. Your smell. You make me sick! You and all of your family should be dead! I hate you! -Hello? -Federico? Yes? It's Graciela. We're at the hospital. The baby's just been born! Hold on, I'll put Sonia on the phone. Honey, she's an angel, you've got to see her. How are you doing? We are waiting for you. Come as soon as you can. It's all going to be all right.
