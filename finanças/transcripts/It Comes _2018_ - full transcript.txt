I don't think of her as a woman anymore. Restrain yourself! Leave me alone. I can't eat at home. With the kid who likes to make some super sweet food Chisa's blog is very valuable Is that so? Hey, take it easy. It's nerve-racking. you're so good at it. My wife keeps saying "Wow, That's the model father!" "Compared to people, look at you" I've only been a father for two years. By the way, I heard that Chisa was seriously injured. I read it in your blog, Is she alright? Oh, It's not a big deal. We took her to the hospital immediately. Don't panic, stay calm. The perfect attitude of a father. Even if my child has a slight fever We go in a state of panic. Is that so? I'm just reacting naturally. There he is, the best father! He's like the "daddy's" God. Huh?What are you guys doing? Don't do that! An angel is sleeping beside me. An angel named Chisa. When you were born, you were like a monkey. Now she's such a perfect little lady. Kana, have you fallen asleep? 2 years old, what kind of dreams are you dreaming of? Daddy's dream... He is calling... Hideki... No... Hideki's not here. He is calling... Chisa... Chi-Chisa Chisa... What happened? He's here. Are you dreaming? He said he wanted to take me away. Chisa Thank you for waiting! "The Grieving Orphan" is the name of the ghost of Genkoji Temple After the sound of "Genkoji Temple" changed to "The Grieving Orphan" Or "Gagozen" Yes this is it I've heard of "Gagozen" Hmm... This is often heard, various documents are also documented It's mostly monsters that take people. But I've never heard of "Bogiwan" yeah. I mean, why would you bring that up? Aren't you interested in Monsters? Because you're an expert at that. Not the same, the so-called "folklore"... I know... I know... So, what do I do? What to do? It's just... a way of dealing if something like that happens, How would I know? Ask Gitaro or the eye-catching father! Aren't you busy? You look tired. Well, maybe. What's wrong? Hey! Do you remember Takanashi? Ah, that noisy colleague in your company? He's dead. Suddenly fell ill was hospitalized for more than 1 year. For what? I don't know. no one knows. But it looked like a bite. A bite? He has this strange scars on his back. The doctor said it looked like a bite Bitten by uneven teeth. What's that? It sounds scary. Stop it! You've got to be kidding me. Let's talk about pleasant topics next How are they? Your beloved wife and daughter? How old is Chisa? Two years old? Hey, Kana! Wake up, Chisa... Hey, Kana. I envy you With a lovely daughter and a gentle wife. You're at the top of happiness. Thank you Hello, the time is now… SHUT UP! Hey! It's okay. Is there really a monster? No, it's not. That's right. Humans, they don't help themselves. And they all blame it on the monsters For example, in poor rural areas killing or abandoning a child is a matter of course. Most places like this have the story or legend of monsters who took the children. But that's all excuses. Actually, the parents killed the kid and buried him. Blame it on the monsters to cover up the facts. Anyway, as folklorists, That's not a good thing to say. So there's no such thing as monsters. That's right. But there are a lot of dirty people like monsters. So... what's this then? What is this? Just come over. I'm home! Chisa! Kana! What happened? What have you done? Mr. Hideki... Let's go He is calling... Chisa... In the mountains... in the mountains... Anyway, you want to get rid of the demon, right? Yes. But we don't know if it's a monster. It's a monster, isn't it?

He's a scumbag. But a scumbag you can trust. You have such an ambiguous attitude, Makoto will not like it Makoto? Higa Makoto. As far as I can tell, she's a good one. Experience and lineage. Is she a professional? Psychic stuff? She is just a hostess. Hey! Get up, ugly girl. I'm Makoto. Ah, yes. (Makoto) Ah, that... I already told her about it Do you have a clue? Yes, I do. Well, in that case, What the hell is it? Why did it come to me? Oh, no, no, I don't understand this. For what reason? Because I'm stupid. Huh? Excuse me? Hmm… The way to deal with it? It's like this... Although I don't know why I catch a cold but I know how to treat it. What should we do next? That's what I know. That's good, right? In that case ... yes. (Spell) Basically... She comes from far away and often appears But... I'm sorry. Can you leave me alone with this guy? When there's too many people, I get upset. Aya got married. After breaking up with her, she got married. I see. What was the reason behind it? I thought you guys got along so well. It happens all the time. We seems to be in indifference lately. So I became single after the breakup. Pig. Don't treat me like an idiot! Hey! Hideki! Hey! What's the matter? Wait a minute! What's up with that woman? Huh? What did she say? And she said to me, "be nice to your wife and children." And said that he wouldn't come. You've got to be kidding me! How dare she say that to me? I'm desperate... Hideki... Desperately trying to protect my family! That's because... I'm stupid. I didn't know what to say. Don't take it personally, because you're telling the truth. He's the one who's angry. he's the idiot. and also… Hmm? Isn't there another one? Ah, Mr. Tsuda. Hmm... That guy's a little... What's up with him? Well, he seems weird. Sorry, sorry. I was just trying to help. I get it. Sorry. Next time, I'll ask someone who's more reliable. I'm sorry. The growth of Chisa is a treasure of our family Always make us feel happy The first step in Chisa's life Today, Chisa finally took the first step by herself Chisa... 2 years old you. What kind of dreams are you dreaming of? (Sunday Angel) My dream is… Wife and Chisa... Every time. Sorry about that! I always thought it was a bad way to end things like that. I'm so sorry. Hello. I'm so sorry to drop by uninvited. Mr. Tsuda called me. They brought some cake. What does it mean? I don't understand. That's true. But Makoto said she had to see the place. So we can think about what we can do. Once she said it, she wouldn't care about anything else. That idiot! We told your wife I'm Mr. Tsuda and your old friend. Makoto is my sister. What can I do? To remove the monster. That's therapy. Before that, Makoto wanted to have a good consultation. To this family and you. If we bother you, we will leave. But at this point... Chisa she... Oh, it's been a long time since I've seen one. Chisa and Kana smiled Delicious. It's delicious. Our family uses Chinese salad dressing for flavor. Not soy sauce? I'll try it another time. You're a good cook. If I keep listening to you, I will be more tempted to cook Hello, there. No smoking here Really? Really useless I'm upset. That all I do is hang some amulets. Why did you name her "Chisa"? The name just came to me. All of a sudden. -Do you have children? -No. No. no need. Those nasty, and troublesome creature. Troublesome? That's what makes them cute. This kid needs me The parents I interviewed earlier said the same thing. Right? Seems to be doting on the kid. Wear high-end designer clothes for children and post online. Yes… As a result, the child was abused to death. I have visited such parents. Hey? I think IT is here. Let's go back. Huh? Keys! Shit! Don't come any closer! IT is gone. Hello? Why? She wants to talk to you. Excuse me? My sister. Hello? Hello, Mr. Tahara. I am Makoto's sister. With all due respect, Something close to you is very vicious To be honest, Makoto is no match for him. It is not yet mature, but with her meager ability it would just stimulate him. I apologize on behalf of my foolish sister. Do you just say "IT"? IT has a very strong will. It will keep going to attack you and your family. So... why is this happening? Why, my family? I don't know. There's no need to know. Excuse me? The important thing is... Not "why" but "what to do". There's a window on the west side of the house, right? Ah... yes. Take a look at the plants outside of the window. Please take a closer look Yes. Ah, there are bugs... Hurry up and burn all the worms. These are the helpers who call IT. That's the only thing you can do right now. What? Sorry, I can’t go to your house yet. I have a few more important cases on my hands. How did that happen? That's why I invited an acquaintances. An acquaintance? Because she's been exposed in front of the press. maybe you know her. She's very capable and experienced, and a trustworthy person. Evil spirits be gone! Can this person really do it? Setsuko Osaka hasn't been on TV lately. Never mind that. Makoto's sister referred her to us. Honestly, I don't know anything about her sister… She is the eldest daughter of the Higa family. Okinawa's psychic, called " Yuta" Anyway, Makoto has great respects for her and is very much afraid of her. And, quite the opposite, very jealous of her… My wife, she always in a state of panic, always scared. It should be okay, Makoto is with her... Makoto... Who the hell is Makoto? I didn't know if she was your girlfriend or your mistress. I can only play with Chisa, and I have no power... Ah, it hurts... Then don't continue. I don't care. (Chinese Restaurant Guangzhou Pavilion) IT is here. Huh? Right now? Here? I think he's, uh, coming. Pick up, Mr. Tahara. It doesn't matter if you don't talk. Just let the other person talk.

One moment, please. Just tell him this, "About Chisa" Did he know? IT speaks with the voice of others That's annoying. Just tell a bunch of lies. What did you say? Are you that kind of dad? Who the hell would go that far? IT only appears when there are a lot of people. You're loud! Don’t give us that protagonist aura, crap? I'm married to you. You're so arrogant. It's just a child. That's not me… What do you know about "family"? I was raised by a mother who was a scumbag. I didn't say that. I wouldn't say this... You didn’t say it, but you think of it. No such thing!

Wait a minute! I'm thinking! (Unknown Number) I'm Makoto's sister. My sister told me. IT has a very strong will to target you. Yeah, that's why I let my family leave the house. Well, yes. Yeah, I'll meet them somewhere. Please, don't meet with your family. Ah, yes, what? If you meet them, they will be in danger. Because "IT" will chase you. Huh? Me? Please go straight home. Excuse me? But... If I go home now, IT will... I'll take care of it. If you can help me. I don't know. It's the only way. Mr. Tahara, can you do that? Um... For you and your family. Chisa! Kana!

Ah, this is it Parental anxiety or anger is the worst Because it will affect the child ’s personality development Chisa, don't cry. It's scary. Not enough love from the parents will determine a child's future. To be honest, when Hideki died I was happy. (Tsuda Daigo: Do ​​you have a minute? I want to talk to you about work) (Definitely good news） (A year and two months ago) I envy you and Hideki. (A year and two months ago) I envy you and Hideki. Huh? To be the father of this lovely girl. Getting married isn't so bad. Thank you for your hospitality a while ago I think I've had too much to drink. Sometimes it doesn't matter. Where's Hideki? Does your dear husband also work on Sundays? No, he went to Chisa's godfather party. You're such a nanny. It's not like that. Whenever he is at home on Sunday I sometimes wish that he would take care of Chisa. Hmm... He must have been in some kind of trouble. No, I don't think so. I read his blog. It’s a very common for dad. Look, Chisa's scar. He wrote it on his blog. (The more urgent it is, the more calm Dad will be!) The more urgent it is, the more calm Dad will be. I am so moved. To say, "being a father changes a person." Mom panicked when she saw her daughter hurt. But at a time like this, dad has to be strong. But he just stood still. What? When Chisa got hurt and started bleeding He didn't even touch her. Don't walk around, calm down. Calm down? Calm down, huh, when our daughter got injured? If I were... If I were to touch her, things will get worse. So? You were just standing while our daughter was bleeding. Are you that kind of dad? You're so arrogant. It's just a child. Excuse me? What did you just say? So what about you, huh? Are you the perfect mom? How dare you talk big. What do you mean by that? What do you know about "family"? What does "that" mean? The daughter of that bad mother, right? What happened? I'm sorry. Look at this. If a single parent wants to be a nurse or a caregiver. There are subsidies for further education. Didn't you say you want to find another job? I always trouble you like this... No, don't worry about that. This is, uh... I did it because of Hideki. Hideki! Still can't forget him? I can't do this alone. What's wrong? Girl. Do you want to be pretty? I'm the daughter of a bad mother I can’t paint it well, Kana. Why can't I apply it well? It's all your fault. Because I gave birth to you. I absolutely... I don't want to be like that woman, but... Don't do this. Feeling depressed and blaming yourself. Nothing good will happen. Come on, Kana. I'm sorry. It's all right. Just tell me if you need anything. Anything. What you can't say to Hideki. Before Hideki died, I have already given up on him. What's this? That rune? Mr. Tsuda gave it to me. He said that can drive away evil. what happened? No, it's fine. How's Makoto? After that, she locked herself up like she was dead. she thinks your husband’s death is her fault. She doesn't mean that. I said to her, "You did your best". But she cut me off angrily. She's not your sister, is she? Ah no. But she's still worried about you two. Huh? Why? Did she sense something again? I don't know. But this family is under attack… The way your husband died. Actually, I was guessing. Has it happened twice that the amulet was torn in front of your eyes? Oh, that… It's a torn amulet in your husband's absence. This is the second time This is your husband, Makoto and me… Take a closer look at these two amulets The fracture is completely different, right? Don't you think it's strange? I asked my friend to investigate the first fracture. That's because… I cut it with scissors. I see… At that time, Hideki and I were in a rough patch. But he... Hello? Kana, would you like to eat out tonight? Just the three of us. But I already started cooking. Does it matter? Home-cooked food can be eaten at any time. Is Chisa here? Let me talk to her. Daddy's looking for you. It's dad. What does Chisa want to eat tonight? Omelet rice! So... (A family of three eats in a restaurant today!!) Dinner at home. (A family of three eats in a restaurant today!!) And eating good omulet rice outside. Which do you like? Eating Omelet rice outside! Right? Give it to me. -I said... -Look, look Did you hear that? Chisa wants to eat outside... Mom, omelet rice. Go over there and play. I can't get to the phone right now. The phone seems to be broken Hey, Kana. That man… He doesn't give a shit about me or Chisa. He just want the three of us to laugh, smile and eat. Upload the photos to his blog. and pretend to be a good dad. Kana, this is for you. Because you haven't been feeling well lately. He just used me and Chisa If you're like this, Chisa will be very sad. Omelet Rice! Omelet Rice! Omelet Rice! SHUT THE FUCK UP! Don't you know Chisa? SHUT UP!!! SHUT UP!!! SHUT UP!!! SHUT UP!!! SHUT UP!!! SHUT UP!!! SHUT UP!!! SHUT UP!!! SHUT UP!!! SHUT UP!!! Mommy! What happened next... I can't remember either. Chisa! Kana! When I came back to my senses, Hideki was in front of me. What have you done? He thought "he" was here. She's sound asleep. As for me, I couldn't sleep at all. This is better than nothing. Thank you. I'm sorry for the trouble. Your husband... Excuse me? As far as I'm concerned, He fought hard to protect you and Chisa. Although, It didn't work, but... I think he did his father's duty. Although you may think that it's useless to say at this point. Your apology is useless. Actually this happened too many times. I'm sorry, I'll just take a look... Please don't do this. Apologize like this, so you can get out of here. This is outrageous! Always skipping work. And bring in your sick child without permission. You know, I just couldn't resist. But you keep your head down... Wait a minute, Mrs. Tahara. I'm not done. Mrs. Tahara! Excuse me... what did Chisa do? She threw her shoes to my granddaughter. Then you see, there she is still laughing. Something's wrong with your child. Excuse me, what about her shoes? Shoes? Mother and daughter are really the same. Sorry about that… That's all for today. we'll talk about it some other time. Please give me back her shoe. Are you such a mother? Is that all you can say? Let's go home, Chisa. How about this pair? Yeah, just like my sister. Sister? Excuse me, miss? He is calling... Miss... Please calm down.

Work and housework, and taking care of Chisa. I put aside everything that binds me. I want to… live as I wish. I'm sorry. It's all my fault because I'm stupid. What did you say Can I really trouble you to help with housekeeping? Ah, no problem at all. I haven’t played with Chisa for a long time. Then please do so, Chisa looks happy too. Happier than me. You're so stylish. Are you going to work? No. A girl just want to look pretty. I just want to... Live as I please. That's great! Excuse me? I always thought you were better now than before. I have been waiting for you for a long time. How about today? Already done. Where are you? Where are you hiding? Where are you, Chisa? Hello? I'm sorry. this is Nozaki. Huh? Nozaki? Makoto? Why are you there? It's none of your business. Where's Miss Kana? Forget it. Is there a Buddhist altar in the living room? I mean this place is too weird. There must be something wrong with Miss Kana. I can't see anything. Forget it, go and see the Buddhist altar! Is there a rune? Tear it up and burn it What's this? It's a charm. It is from "IT". That guy made it into a rune. That bastard in Tsuda! Mr. Tsuda? Sometimes I wish that Chisa would just disappear. Sometimes… I've become so sick of that kid. I'm just tired. No, I... (Spell) IT is calling... Chisa? Don't hold back. Kana is Kana, just live as you wish But... Chisa she... is very annoying, right? Chisa! Where are you? Stupid! Think! Come on, Sucker! Chisa? My Chisa. Chisa! Dad said... let's go together. (Two hours later) I want to go to the Omelet Rice Kingdom. All toys and teachers All turned into omelette rice Welcome home. You're always worried about other people's business. What about yourself? How are things with Mr. Nozaki? He said I care too much about other people's children. Excuse me? He said, "a woman who can't have a baby". "It's sad to see someone's child get better" That son of a bitch… Can't you give birth? I did a lot of stupid things Do you like Chisa? Hmm... Then, you can have her. Don't you know Chisa? Aren't we supposed to be raising this kid together? Chisa, no! Chisa! Miss Kana! Please take Chisa out of here. Run! I'll be right there. But Makoto... Just leave it to me. All you have to do is think about you and Chisa. Why? Is it my fault? How could this happen? It doesn't matter now, does it? Anyway, take Chisa away. Get as far as you can! I can't do it! Where am I supposed to go? What's next? I can't do anything... Cheer up! Are you her mother? The phone you are dialling is not receiving a signal. (Tsuda Daigo) I'm sorry. I'm very sorry. Mom, I gotta pee. Where are we going, mom? Where are we going? I don’t know as well. Where do you want to go? To the mountains. to the mountains, to the mountains, to the mountains, to the mountains, to the mountains... Fuck off! You… Fuck off! It's all your fault. because I... give birth to you. Makoto... At the last moment, I heard that voice "Give me back the child." "Chisa" "Come... come..." "Chisa.." Chisa... He is... He.. I took her because you said you didn't want her. "I don't need children" Because you said you don’t want it, so I took her. You and my child. I obviously want to be born. This child wants to be born too. So you're gonna let him go. With your hands. Why? Give the baby back. And gave life to the gods. Speaking of which, the people of this country… You killed a lot of kids. You threw them away. I... I want to be born I… Want to be born That kid... Stupid kid. You are… This is… The child's earliest wound and many more. Who are you? I'm this idiot's sister. Where's the ring? What? Her silver ring. By the time I found her… Filth. Excuse me? The evil that remains in the wound. Attracting bad things. If she had her ring on, it wouldn't be this bad. But... Is everything all right? My name is Higa Kotoko. My sister is in your care. Makoto! Thank you for your hard work. I'm sorry to disturb you all of a sudden. Of course. I've got it all set up. And then... What is the time of arrival at Haneda Airport? Okay, I get it. I'm so sorry to see you go. I have a few things to ask for. Yes Stop it! Your body hasn't recovered yet... So you want me to stay out of it? Are you kidding me? Let go of me, you fool! Looks like the smoke from the cigarette is working. Sis. What are you doing? Don't touch me. Even you should know that That's not an ordinary bite. You'll die. But Chisa... I’ll be in charge from now on. (Spell) At the latest, I'll take care of it by tomorrow. Tomorrow? Because there's another job the day after tomorrow. No problem, because it's already in preparation. (Spell) (Spell) Just say it's okay… Hello, Kotoko? Yes, just now. - Tell the residents of the apartment. - Yeah? That there's a gas leak or something. I understand. Is Makoto really troublesome? Pretending to be a professional psychic. To do this kind of exorcism. But that's because I asked her... "Yuta" has nothing to do with family or blood. Yes. My power belongs to me alone. But this kid has been learning from me. When she was 10 years old, I showed her my wounds. In order for her to understand the job, How life-threatening it is. Then this kid... The next day, she cut herrself with a knife. What a stupid kid. Thanks for the food. And after that?… To purify the chaotic air stream. This is my job. What about Chisa? The child ’s spirit is wandering. Can't find the way home. Can you get her back? You want her back? Don't you hate children? I mean, it doesn't matter what other people's kids do. No, I... Even if we get her back, The kid's parents are gone. I hate children too. Because children can be dangerous. So did Makoto… Anyway, she's a kid. When you were young, Mr. Nozaki. Have any experience killing insects or frogs for fun? Ah, yes. Kids, sometimes... I don't know why they're so deeply attracted to death. Want to smell the smell of death. IT is... IT is... calling... Likewise, the dead are attracted to life. Like a double-sided mirror. Dead soul longing for living life Love life and want to take it. Anyway, we have to hurry. Now the boundary with the outer world becomes blurred. Does Mr. Tahara have a blog? Yes It's a great blog… It's all made up, the man did it… Even if it's fake, it's a good place to hide. What? Gentle father and mother full of contradictions and chaos. (My family is the best !!!) I won’t be hurt by cruel reality. Maybe the spirit of Chisa. is there now. That blog? Three days ago, someone updated the blog. Scary, huh? Today, the family of three challenged to make cookies. Chisa has inherited her talent for cooking The ugliest cookie... It's embarrassing, but dad made it. Makoto developed psychic powers on her own. Hurt one's body and mind. But the kid wasn't afraid to get hurt. So it's dangerous. Very dangerous. What is pain? So, uh... Do you hate me playing with Chisa? No, I hate it when you get yourself hurt. Hurt? Why would it hurt? because I… Can't have children? I don't care! Even if it is someone else's child, love is love! Anyway... Why are you so cocky about these things? You're the one who got hurt, aren't you? Because you can't see it. So without even realizing it you put the blame on others! That's enough. Just say it! I'll be right back. Mr. Tsuda. Why is my throat always dry? Do you know what happened to Miss Kana? Poor thing. It didn't take long to fuck that married woman. The conniving idiot. He's your friend, right? He's my toy. From the old days. My interest is to steal from him. Including Miss Kana I stole his wife. That idiot knows that. But he posted it with a smirk. It was so funny. You… To create an empty family. And the face looks terrible And showing off to me about that boring blog. Disgusting! Hey, that's what you think. I didn't.… Don't lie to me. You despise Hideki. Whatever happened to that idiot? Let's hope he's gone soon. I didn't… You're me. Almost the same Don't love anyone and don't believe in anything. Everyone else and myself. -I...-Are you happy? That's why… Before taking the child away Aya said, you were like a dead man. She can't live with the dead. It's like a mirror. Me… You're the one. Just say that... Are you tourists? We're here to get rid of the demon. You can see the Sky Tower. Look there. Calm down... Isn't that serious? Where is it now? It's a tough one. It would be better if we split up. We're getting off at Shin-Yokohama. Then we'll get off at Shinagawa. At least one of us is gonna make it. Ready? That's enough... Do you know what time it is? Chisa. Alright. Makoto is not here. She disappeared an hour ago. I was too busy to care. How did this happen? She can't do this alone. Anyway, the child's body or mind are not in this world. Can I drink? Are you worried about Makoto? It's a good opportunity for a woman in trouble to get away. Don't say that. Today, half of my men were killed. We don't have enough men. I'm sorry. can you help me? Help you? Cleaning Mr. Tahara Hideki's house. That apartment? Tomorrow, I will summon that thing. If it was that place, it wouldn't be lost. Chisa, and Makoto I will summon everything to that place. Solve it in one breath. "IT" can now summons all kinds of things. It's getting really big. If you don't make it sooner, we can't stop IT. People will die. Thanks for your hospitality. Are you afraid? Excuse me? Ah, no. I peeped at your conscience many times Mr. Nozaki, we’re probably very similar What do you mean? because we’re afraid of losing we don’t want someone to love and that includes lovers, friends and family ...and children. I don't want to have kids. Because we fear losing more than anyone else. don't we? I dunno. maybe. Won't be happy for the birth of life. And won't grieve over the loss of life. -I... -Are you happy? (Consent for abortion) You… I'm relieved. You find evil everywhere.

Please accept the pain you feel. Please don't interfere with my work. You hate kids, don't you? Let go of her! Let go of that child! No! Because This child...

Even I don't understand. Not at all. You… It hurts! Damn it! Please. Enough already. It's a child's prank. Just? Hope others would notice me. That someone would love me. But I didn't know what to do. That's why I make a mess. It's not the same level. How many people have given their lives to this child? It's the same thing. She is nothing but a lonely child. Just because she's still a kid, Always been lonely, That's why they play with monsters! Mr. Nozaki, this is nothing like you. Is that true? Aren't you also vulnerable? Very troublesome Chisa IT is calling... Chisa! Chisa Chisa Don't go! Everyone is happy When you were born Let go of the kid! Give her back… Chisa! Give the baby back! Give me back! Don't No!
