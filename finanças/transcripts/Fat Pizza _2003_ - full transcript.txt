Pizza delivery is a dangerous business. Now, to stay alive, man, you're gonna have to follow three simple rules. Listen, 'cause I'm not saying them again, alright? Number one — if the customer, like, invites you inside, never go in, mate — never! Do come in! I have a nice hot tip waiting for you. (ALARM BLARES ) Mate, rule number two — man, get a fake licence from Habib. (TYRES SQUEAL) Can I see your licence, please, sir? Of course. I mean, it's required by law.

Man, he was the biggest stooge of a pizza guy you've ever seen. You know? He was too polite! Excuse me, sir. (Screams) How many times did I tell him, man? These people here, they're bums. There's no room for etiquette in this area. (Indian accent) Excuse me, madam. Would you be so kind as to tell me where is the Punt Road, please? This f—--ing wog... ...is trying to rape me, kids.

(Growls) You see, I am Hindu and this pizza has beef all over it, sir! I'm sorry, but I cannot deliver such a thing, sir. From now on I only deliver the vegetarian pizzas, huh? OK? Now, this is your prime example of a bloke not suited to pizzas, mate. Look at him. Look at his head. And, man, this is another bloke who ignored the first rule. Look, don't go into these houses, man — please! (Screams) Man, this India, he hates Bobo that bad, what he's done — him and his cousins, they set up their own shop, like a dodgy version of Fat Pizza.

There's all these nuts out there. (Crowd outside shouts) (All cheer) (BUBBLING NOISE) Come on, man, no hangs in the church. Where have you been? Alright, I'll admit, it probably wasn't a good idea, dropping in at the boxing on the way to a wedding. What boxing? And I'll admit that maybe trying to clean the ring from the spew from the kid was not a good idea, like, with them blokes bumping me. (Crowd roars) (TECHNO MUSIC) But, man, I won't admit that being late was, like, purely my fault. There was other stooges involved. (TECHNO MUSIC) (MYSTICAL MUSIC) (MYSTICAL MUSIC) (Screams) Oh, come on, mate. You're a nerd! So, then, Mrs Giglioti, what happens is the magician... ( FANFARE) ...he has magicked the ring into the ring. (TECHNO MUSIC) (CROWD ROARS) Take it easy, mate, alright? So, you know, I knew I'd never beat these two with boxing, 'cause they was too big, so what I had to do was use, like, wrestling...tricks. (BELL RINGS) (TECHNO MUSIC) You wanna mess with the little guy, huh?! This is what you get, mate! This is what you get! (CROWD ROARS) This is fake like your stupid magic tricks, isn't it? The champion is here! Oh, no. (All heckle) The champ! The champ! I am the ch... Ow! (Crowd cheers) I'm the champ! (TECHNO MUSIC) (BELL RINGS) Look, can we just f—--ing get on with this f—--ing wedding?! Well, can we?! F---ing open it. Now, you, put the ring on her finger. Go on, put it on her finger. (Stammers) Yes. Yes, that's it. Right, you're married. Good f—--ing luck to you. (All shout) (Screams) What about us?! You stupid f—--ing priest! What do you think you're doing, you dumb c--- priest?! Can you make this marrying s--- any quicker? I gotta get down the pub. Alright. You wanna get married?! Fine. You're married. You're married. You're f—--ing married. Now everyone's f—--ing married! (Guests cheer) ('WEDDING MARCH' PLAYS) And at this point, all there was left to do was go and get pissed. (Wedding guests shout) Rocky, I didn't bring any rice, man. What are we gonna throw? Habib, don't worry about rice. I got eckies instead. Eckies? My God, weddings can be so expensive.
