Showa 20 (1945) January 1st Mother! Mother! What? Come here for a moment, Mother! You are going to catch a cold! It's time to go to bed now. I saw a shooting star. Did you make a wish? What for? It’s a secret. Good night. Mother! I wished that I would become as pretty as you when I grow up. Just go to sleep now. Mother! Shiro is barking. Watch out! - Hold my hand tight! - Mother! Shiro! Miyo! Miyo! Shiro! Shiro! Shiro! Miyo! Mother! Mother! Out of the way! Japan was deeply wounded due to the long Pacific War. B-29s dropped their firebombs relentlessly. The capital of the Empire looked about to become completely demolished. Koho Kannami, the spiritual leader of Japan, was secretly preparing surprising plans for... a miracle victory of Japan by reversing the troubled situation. Spiritual national defense. Defeating the allied forces by combining Buddhism and science using black magic. This was an operation unprecedented in history. Start the first transmission test! However, the capital was nearly dead and fraught with anger, sadness and bitterness. An incredible amount of energy from those emotions... had accumulated over 1,000 years over the capital. The revengeful spirits rose up from the dead and summoned him. What is this? This chilling energy?

That's correct, General Tojo. This is an operation aiming to protect the nation by using black magic. As the nation is on the verge of demolition, it's time for us to equip ourselves with spiritual weaponry. This transmission tower is the largest and strongest weapon... with which we can execute this operation. This facility has been taken for granted... for the last 10 years due to financial reasons. It's our largest transmission tower, about 54 meters high. As part of the preparations for this operation, we have procured a 5,000-horsepower DC generator from Germany. With this machine, Mr. Kannami's energy, transmitted from the prayer room... will be amplified into a gigantic wave reaching all over the world. I am sure it will kill the leaders of our enemies. Don't you think your reputation will suffer... from this sort of ridiculous trick? Kill Roosevelt and Churchill with black magic? Ridiculous! Our mission is to make every single one... of the 100 million citizens fight for victory! The same goes for the military! Please consider, General Tojo! Our physical strength has already run out. We'd end up wasting more lives of our citizens. In exchange, at least the lives of the leaders will be spared. There is no other way for our nation to survive. Why is that? Tell me the reason! The reason! Pray to the Bodhisattva and victory shall come. That is what God told me. Finally, you made me stand up! General Tojo! I have been informed that not only are the US bombing us with B-29s, they also developed atomic bombs! Moreover, you must have heard that the target would be the capital! General Tojo! There is no alternative. Shut up! I don't have time to listen to your ridiculous charlatanry! I'm leaving. That complicates things… We won't get support from the military like this! Konoe. This morning, a mission was delivered from Operation Astra in Germany. Operation Astra? I heard that is an institute researching pre-emptive strike tactics, directly under Chancellor Hitler's supervision. Their pre-emptive strike tactics are very good and practical. They predicted the assassination attempts on Hitler, and the movements of Churchill's units. Their attacks have been very successful recently and have achieved a lot. So… In order to succeed with our plan... I asked them to predict the best day for our spiritual attack. When is it? On May 1st… - This patient? - Yes. I brought the drug you asked for. Ito! Treat him and take him out. Yes. She will take care of you. Hey, can you stand? Straight, you can do it! Be careful! You have to watch out when you are walking. Nightshift Nurse Room Sit down. Wear this. You don't have to be afraid anymore. What is your name? Miyo. Miyo... How old are you? My mother died. I see. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Hey, hey, hey! Keiko! Would you like to join me tonight? I finally got red bean soup! Let's have it together! Midori and Junko will come as well. It's real red bean soup, not the fake stuff! Let's eat it after putting in sakura leaves and some salt. We also have calpis. Sorry. Okay… We also got canned peaches though! Yukiko, if you stay alone like this for long, you might go crazy. See you. - See you! - Goodbye! - See you later! - Goodbye. - Reiko, let's go. - Okay. Hurry, hurry! Yukiko Tatsumiya I'm home. Stay away! Stay away! The capital is such a mess. I can't even consider this our territory anymore. We have to deliver results from the upcoming battle. It's already a battlefield. Watch out! What is that? - Good morning. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Good morning. Tatsumiya! Yes. We are evacuating children to Fukushima. The bombings will become more severe from now on. If you like, I'd want you to lead them. How about it? Mizuki! Good morning. - You would do it, right? - Do what? Would you go to Fukushima? Yes! Of course, I don’t want to die. - Mizuki! - Sorry. You don’t have to answer right now. Just consider it. Okay? Yukiko! Let’s go to Fukushima together! Okay? Okay? Yukiko! Please come. Miyo! It’s not scary. Just move to another empty bed. Miyo! What’s up? Scared again? Miyo can only see Yukiko, right? Miyo!? Let’s go. Miyo, can you really see me? How? You are the only one shining in my sight in sky-blue color. I see. Can you promise me that you won’t tell anyone about that? This is a secret between you and me. Understood? Thank you. Miyo, let’s change. They might be a bit big but I brought some clothes for you. Light purple. - Very beautiful color. - Thank you. - I’ve brought a good-luck charm. - A good-luck charm? Here… From Masakado, the God who protects Tokyo. - Thank you for the meal. - Thank you for visiting. Sure is cold… Can I have some dumpling soup? Yurakucho… Yurakucho… Excuse me… Excuse me! - Yes? - Could you post this for me? It should be delivered by Monday. Evacuate! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! This way! This way! Get off from the bike! Get inside now! Kato! If you don't mind, would you answer a question? About the guy we saw during bombing... I’ve felt that kind of evil energy before. Kato! That’s what you said. Who is that guy? You fear him, right? But why? You have a very strong energy in you. I don’t want to talk about that. Why can’t you tell me? Why?! I don’t want to talk about anything! I'm sorry. I didn’t mean to hurt your feelings. Forgive me. Because this is the kind of world in which we are living… Everybody is trying to survive this crisis. But I just run away every time. Give me your hand. My body has been damaged by such a trivial attack. I wish I had power as strong as yours… I'm leaving then… Wait… Koto Mayami. Do you have some concerns you can’t reveal to me? Did you sell out? Why did you betray us?! You are the one who told me to follow Buddha’s path! Killing people with our Buddhist monks’ black magic is wrong! Are you saying that killing a few enemy leaders to save millions is right? Despite this losing war and our practice of Buddha’s path... the evil energy from a thousand years bares its fangs to destroy the capital. I laughs at our stupidity! Are we that… That… powerless before this fate? I'm not sure if I can follow Buddha’s path anymore. - Mr. Ogasawara! - Leave it! No time for hesitation! You have a mission to accomplish! As do I. Your life, which I restored, is not yours. Nakamura! We have to save this nation by any means necessary! Japan has no future at the moment. Sister! What’s up? What’s up? I'll take care of today’s mission! I'm Mori! Thank you. We just hope we won’t overdo it. - Start the machine! - Starting the machine! There's a jamming signal. Kato! I shall destroy the capital completely! That’s your destiny! - Nakamura! Now! - Yes, sir! It’s a trap! Retreat! - Flare. - Yes, sir! Help me! What was that? What was that!? Captain! There's some movement! Where? Let’s go! You bastard! Shit! - Stop! - Shut up! Let me go! Die! Die!!! Die! Can you use spiritual energy? Do you think you can defeat me? Thank you for your work. Thank you for your work. I'll completely destroy your foolish operation. The spirits of 10 million people from this land... demand the demolition of the capital. Scissors! Opener! Here. Hold this part firmly! Apply pressure! Pulse is weakening! It’s not enough! - Bring oxygen! - Yes! Gauze! Gauze! Sister! This person shines subtly in sky-blue color too. A beautiful kind of blue. You saw it, right? Yes. This scar is like a cross I have to bear until death. When I was young, not knowing anything, I played with my spiritual powers. I ended up getting this scar. After that, I was immediately transferred to a military facility. I lived like a laboratory animal. I wanted to meet you. I wanted to know more about you. I wanted to let you know about me. There is nothing I can do for you right now. Sorry. I wasn’t supposed to tell you about this. But there is nothing much left to do anymore. Don't do it! You can't defeat him! He is too strong for you! Don’t fight! I'm going to tell you… About everything. This is the burial mound for Masakado's severed head, which has existed in the capital for 1000 years. A spiritual-energy battle took place here for the survival of the capital. Kato wanted to destroy the capital. It is believed that he caused the Kanto earthquake. Has he been around for that long? In the end, his activities were blocked by the Masakado family. However, Kato’s spirit has loomed over the family ever since. That includes the last survivor of the family, which is me. Kato is the embodiment of the spirits of the capital's dead. There is no one capable of defeating him. Yukiko! This is my battle. You won’t see Kato anymore. Still thinking about it? Evacuation? I'll definitely go. I mean… Anyway, Yukiko! Do you know what a kiss is? I don’t know what it is yet. So I don’t want to die yet… You shouldn’t talk about that in front of soldiers. But… A B-51? Stop! That’s dangerous! It’s fine! They don’t shoot hospitals. Reiko! Reiko! Are you okay? Are you okay? It’s okay now. Hurry to the shelter please! To the underground shelter! - Hurry up, please! - Please be careful! The capital is burning… Nakamura! I'll stay as well! I'll fight with you! Don't. This is my battle! Please promise me that you'll evacuate. I can’t! - I can't run away alone! - Wrong! You have your own mission! Protect Miyo! - That’s your battle. - But... I'll definitely come back… After defeating Kato. After coming back, I'll see you again… So… Miyo! Sister! Sister! I'm back. Sister! Let’s go to Fukushima together. Please. Let's go together. April 30th I will not tolerate any talk of capitulation in my presence! I alone can understand the political situation. But... But my Fuhrer! You don't yet know about our final weapon... that was predicted by our great Operation Astra. Our Japanese partners... will bury the military leaders of the Allied Forces once and for all! Long time no see. I never thought you would call me. This way! This way! - Let’s go. - Excuse me! Excuse me! The train departs shortly. Please get on board immediately. - Sorry. - Thank you for your work. Excuse me. Excuse me. - Everybody is here. - Sorry for being late. I thought you wouldn’t come. Why? For some reason I felt that way. With this device, it is possible that your spiritual energy is unleashed at once. But that's not all. Your soul itself might turn to ectoplasm and disappear. I know. Start the transmission! Yes, sir. - Start the machine! - Starting the machine! Now that the betrothed have confirmed their will to enter into marriage, I hereby declare the marriage as legally binding. Berlin, April 1945 Read and signed: 1.) Husband 2.) Wife 3.) Witness of the 1st 4.) Witness of the 2nd 5.) Registrar Eva Hitler (née Braun) You are now legally husband and wife. Heil Hitler! Why? Why me? What happened? It's him! He is here! Kato! - Stop the operation! - Understood! - Okuda! Take care of this! - Yes, sir! - Haneda! Check the transmitter! - Yes, sir! Hurry! How weak you are… I won’t let you go in one piece! Yu…ki…ko… Are you Yukiko Tatsumiya? Kato! Masakado! Holy Spirit, please go back to where you belong. Mister! Mr. Konoe, Japan will lose! What? The war ends with this. Japan has had enough. As long as the capital survives, we can bear the loss. One day, we can show the world the power of Japan again. Bastard! You plotted against me?! Miyo! Let’s go. With the sudden death of Adolf Hitler, Nazi Germany collapsed and Japan faced the end of the war.
