(laughs) - [Officer] Don't be stupid! Time is running out! - What's the situation? - Six men. Heavily armed. They got the payroll. You've got them cornered in the third landing. Your move. You up there! You've got five minutes to drop your guns and come out with your hands up! (guns fire) (guns fire) - [Man] Get back, let's get outta here! Come on, the car's out by the railroad tracks.

Where is he? - He's right over there. Come on. (patrons chatter) This is Mr. Stromberg. - [Mr. Tanaka] Mr. Stromberg. - Welcome to the USA, Mr. Tanaka. - Tanaka? - Katsuyo Tanaka, that's your new name. - Oh, thank you. - Knox over here'll show you the car. Austin wants to see you tomorrow. - We have to be very careful. We can't afford exposure. This is background material. I want you to memorize all of the names, all of the dates. Here's a number where you can reach us. But don't use it unless you have to. We'll call you. - Tell your boss, I'm extremely pleased with arrangements. (traffic hums) (suspenseful music) - Okay, do me a favor, will you? - Anything. - Give me the room solo for a minute, I gotta make a call. Go on, get outta here. - You kept us waiting, asshole. - Look, I got the merchandise you want. I just got in from Hong Kong. - Okay, I'll meet you in an hour, same place. (phone thuds) - (sighs) What was that? Was that the contact? - You just be ready. That's all you have to know. Tell the boys it's time to go. (suspenseful electronic music) - [Man] One of our friends is upstairs, second door on your left. Go on up. - [Man] Try to cool that stuff, yeah. (suspenseful electronic music) - I'm going in. (bag crinkles) - Hm, not bad. (bag crinkles) - You gotta be kidding! This junk is shit! - What in the fuck are you talkin' about? Who is this asshole? - Bad junk man, it's nothin' but dirt. (suspenseful electronic music) - Listen, Frampton, I can take my smack elsewhere if you don't appreciate it. - Stay cool. - (scoffs) It stinks, it's rat poison. - Shut him up, Reilley, will ya? - I'm tellin' you man, this stuff is no good! You're gonna be sorry. (midtempo electronic music) - All units come in, all units come in. (men groan) (kick thuds) Get up. Move.

(knife clicks) (gun fires) (men chatter) - Hey, you all look hungry to me, whadya say we have a party? (group cheers) - [Man] Bring 'em over here! - Let's go, let's go! Big headlines, throw a big party, what do you say? - Come on, help yourself, they're hot now, they're hot. (men chatter excitedly) - Mr. Firework. - You gotta hurry. - Pizza line, the pizza's here. - Jenny, I knew if I put you on top of this, you'd deliver. Here you go, babe, have some pizza. - Sorry to get you out of bed. - Hey, it's okay. I've been tryin' to nail that snakeskin Frampton for years. Who finally brought him down? - I did. Unavoidable. - Well it would've been a bitch to get a conviction anyway. What about the one that flew?- - Oh, we're looking under all the usual rocks. - (chuckles) I gotta get some sleep. Big trial tomorrow. - Hey. My place. - 10 minutes. (hooves clop) - Good girl. - [Stromberg] Mr. Austin. - Ah, Stromberg. Go on, girl. What have we got? - [Stromberg] Well, gold is up. - [Austin] How much? - [Stomberg] Four dollars. - [Austin] Unbelievable. How's copper? - Up 45. - Hm. - And Hong Kong Holding is up 26 points. Yamamoto came in last night. - Uh-huh. - We've got him in the safe house now. - I see. Look, you send a Telex to Tokyo and collect final payment. When's our next transfer? - Friday from Singapore. - Ah-ha. Oh, I want a closer match up than that. The face that you picked is a bit old. - You probably heard about the heroin bust on the waterfront last night. I got a description of the carrier. And it fits Carnahan. - I suppose that's why he didn't report to me today. - We checked with his landlady. He moved out this morning in a hurry. - I never trusted that little bastard, you find him. Oh Wendy, don't, love. (suspenseful electronic music) (door thuds) (man screams) - [Woman] Oh no! (man groans) No! (woman whimpers and screams) (traffic hums) - That's not the worst of it, captain. Poor guy lost an ear to his killers. We had a couple cases like, like this last month, same touch. - And what did uh, fingerprints turn up? - Positive ID on the victim. Ex-con named Fresno Murchison. - Murchison. Walked on a rape charge in January. - Right. - That was your case, wasn't it, Tom? - Yeah, yeah, I remember it. Come on, let's go, we're late. - What were you doing there so early, Mr. Makena? - I went in to use the bathroom. - You were alone in the gas station with the deceased when the robbery took place? - Nobody was there but me. - Now let's go over it once more. At 6:45, a man came into the gas station, pointed a gun at the proprietor, Mr. Kwong, and demanded the contents of the safe. When Mr. Kwong hesitated, the man shot him three times in the face at point-blank range. Now, you got a very good look at the killer, didn't you? - Uh-huh. - You saw his face in the morning sunlight. - Uh-huh. - Do you see the man in this court? - No? - [Lawyer] I'm sorry, would you repeat that? - I don't see the guy. - Son of a bitch, he's been bought. - For the last time. I'm pointed at defendant Haskell. Is this not the man you-- - Objection, Your Honor. She's leading the witness. - Sustained. - No, the guy had blonde hair. He looked like one of those surfer boys. (group cheers) (gavel pounds) - Order! (men chatter boisterously) - Too bad, Stevens. Thought this case was gonna be your ticket to the front page, didn't you? - Guess you won't be following him to the Mayor's station, Miss Sleighton. Gonna be voting for an asshole. (laughs) Chump. - [Man] Come on, come on. Come on, let's go see. (horn honks) (traffic hums) - Get away from that window! - Why are you so jumpy? We keep moving from one hotel to another and back again. And I don't even understand what's going on. - Some guys downstairs. I gotta shake those bastards or we'll never get out of Honolulu alive. (suspenseful electronic music) I made a quiet arrangement with one my connections. We're taking a freighter to Malaysia. I want you to hold onto this for me. - What is it? - That's my life insurance, baby. (midtempo instrumental music) - [Jenny] You know what you're doing, don't you? - What am I doing? - You're breaking your own first rule. - What's that? - Don't let it get to you. - Every time I think about that prick Haskell-- - Well don't think about him. - Come on, let's go. (engine hums) - Are you coming up? - I'll see you tomorrow. (door thuds) (engine revs) (gentle electronic music) (lock squeaks) (purse thuds) (doorbell rings) Go ahead. (romantic orchestral music) (traffic hums) (patrons chatter) (pool balls clack) - What the fuck are you doing here? Somebody could've followed you. - I want more money. - You've already been paid. - I need more. I'm leaving town. - Good. Where? - We're gonna get a boat and sail to Niihau. - The forbidden island, right? No Haoles allowed. - Then I won't have to look at another ugly white face like yours again. (man laughs) (patrons chatter) (suspenseful electronic music) (weapon fires) (Makena groans) (sirens wail) - [Dispatcher] All units at the setting of 26 hotel room. We've got a mutilated corpse, multiple stab wounds. - [Officer] 14, on our way. This must be it, check out the voyeurs. - Yep, let's go. All right, out of the way out of the way. You know who he is? - No, he just dead here. - No witnesses? - Nothin'. - [Officer] Holy shit. - You're in deep trouble, Carnahan. You should've asked permission before you started your junior import trade. - That was small change, I was just moonlighting! - Make it quick. - Listen to me, Austin! I got a list! Someone's keepin' it for me. Every name is on it. If anything happens to me-- - Hm, blackmail? - I just want out, that's all! Guarantee me safe passage to the mainland. You'll never see me again. - Aw, let him go. (suspenseful electronic music) - [Boy] Dead man this way. (onlookers chatter) - Whadya got? - The little kids found Houdini floatin' down here. Looks kinda young, about 20-25 years of age. Never seen him before. Must've been out here a long time. - Get some statements, will ya? (traffic hums) (typewriters click) - Brown, what do you got on the smack peddler? - Got a report he was spotted in Chinatown last night. - Okay, chief wants us. - How good is this? - Close enough. We got it posted all over town. Airport, liquor stores, massage parlors, you name it. - [Jenny] Hey Commander, what do you got for us? - Got a weird one here. Kid found a corpse on a beach this morning. I want you guys to handle it. Here's the lab report. 25 year old male named Billy Shamura. Autopsy shows he's been dead about two years, and here's the funny part. Billy Shamura is not dead. I repeat, not dead. I had it double checked. According to both county and federal records, Billy Shamura's alive and kicking. Taxpayer with an active social security number. - Let's go to work. (uptempo electronic music) - [Man] Well, we're looking for a man named Tokuda, and a-- - [Man] Tokuda, yeah. Tokuda used to work with us. He worked with us until last January. - [Man] Uh-huh. - [Man] And then he came into some big bucks or something, now he lives on the Island of Lanai. - Lanai, huh? - Yeah, Lanai. - [Man] You got an address? - [Man] I'm afraid not. - [Man] Well, I suppose we'll just fly down, check it out ourselves. - Okay. - Been a lot of help, Chief. Thank a lot. - Anytime. (uptempo electronic music) (traffic hums) - Bingo, Billy Shamura's mother used to work in that stall, but she's not there anymore. We'll find her in a nuthouse in Waipio. - [Woman] 2402, Dr. Alan Greenberg, 2402. - I heard what he said. I'm not a biter. Who are you? - Mrs. Tokuda? I'm Lieutenant Kobayashi from the Honolulu Police. And this is Inspector Sleighton. - I don't know why he should say that about me. I haven't bitten anyone in years. - We just wanted to ask you a couple questions. - I'm not crazy, and I'm not dead. - Mrs. Tokuda. Mrs. Tokuda. We're here about your son, Billy Shamura. - I've. I was crazy then. When the brought me here. That's because I felt so bad. I just, I had a little nervous breakdown, that's all. After Billy's death. That son of a bitch. Tokuda, my husband. He wanted to take the money. - What money? - I didn't want it like that. We had so many bills to pay. I'll never forgive him, the bastard. But it's not the right thing. A mother has to bury her son. I didn't bury him, I had. (Mrs. Tokuda sobs) - I'm sorry. Guess we better check out the old man in Lanai. - Call Sergeant Keno. - Mr. Stromberg, she had a couple visitors today. Both cops. (airplane hums) (travelers chatter) (announcer chatters) - Hey, Keno. - Hey bud, how's it goin'. - Okay. This is Inspector Sleighton. - How you doin'? Come on, I got the car out here. What you got for us, any leads? - I got a current address on Tokuda Takashi. - Mm-hm. - I asked around, and I hear the old boy's been blowin' a lot of money lately. Gambling. - Hey, good work. (suspenseful music) (travelers chatter) (crowd cheers) (men whoop) - That's him over there. - I wanna talk to him. - Okay. - I don't believe this shit. (men shout and cheer) (roosters crow) - Billy dead. Fall from fire escape. Broke his neck. (fingers snap) Like this. Neighbor say, go and tell cops. Two white men come. They say to me and to my wife. Leave no report. That Billy's still alive. They give. 10 thousand dollar. (ominous electronic music) They take Billy body away. - We need a description. (man speaks foreign language) - We need a description of these two men. (man speaks in foreign language) - Now-- - Down! (guns fire) (guns fire) (gun fires) (engine revs) (gun fires) (guns fire) (explosion booms) (suspenseful electronic music) - Wait! Drop it! Hey! How do you feel, slick? Feel like takin' the big ride? (gun fires) - The Lanai operation. They popped our boys. We're clean, though. I purified the setup. - Look, you better go out and hire some muscle. Someone who can't be traced to us. I don't care what it costs. Damn it, if it hadn't been for Carnahan, these bloody double dealing, this would never have happened. Look, I think we better suspend operations temporarily. - Very well. - Stromberg? Who did it? - A lousy policewoman. They call her Silk. - Ah. No identification yet on the two hit men. It was rented car. Looks like they flew from here this morning. Hey, want some coffee? - No thanks. - Yashi? - Yeah, old boy. (phone rings) - We lost the old man. - Yeah, I just heard about it, that's why I came down, I was worried about you. You look beat. - I am. You know, somebody took the trouble to send a couple of icemen after Tokuda. This game is rougher than we thought. (suspenseful electronic music) (patrons chatter) - [Man] Give me a winning shot at this. Let's see if I can do it. - Okay. - [Man] You needed to make pool. - [Man] You got it nailed. - Hey. - You okay? - You all right? - Yeah. (patrons laugh and chatter) Oh. Hey, what is this? What's going on? Who the fuck are you guys? (groans) (Haskell groans) - Yeah. (water rushes) Sweet shit, what a rush. - Hey Warren. - Yeah. - [Tom] For you, there. - Hey Stevens! Stevens! Hey Stevens, hey! Slow down a second, son of a bitch. What the hell is this I hear about my client, Haskell, huh? Where is he? - He's in the morgue. Visiting hours are flexible. - [Travis] Yeah, well what about the others, huh? There was a whole string of 'em. Whitehead, Rubicoff, Fresno Murchison, that was just last week. All innocent victims, hm? - [Tom] You're bleedin' for criminals, Travis. - [Travis] Hey, they were free men, huh? Okay, at least on a technicality, maybe. - [Tom] You're talkin' about scumbags that should've gone up. - [Travis] God damn it, Stevens! - Hey, you, don't you threaten me. Don't sweat it, Travis. If you're clean, you're safe. - What was that all about? - He's crooked. Makes him nervous. (suspenseful electronic music) - Come on. (bag clatters) Quick, let's go. - [Man] Hey there, pretty boy. (man groans) - Run baby, run! (men groan) (men groan) No, no! (groans) (water trickles) - Look, Silk, I know it's gonna be hard to recognize these cold cuts, but believe it or not, that's the scag smuggler. Minus one ear. Multiple stab wounds. - Looks like it was a little overdone. - That's right. - Yeah, the killer's obviously enthusiastic about their work. - Yashi, any witnesses? - Nah, they're not talkin', they're all clammed up. The whole neighborhood's scared. - Not a hell of a lot more we can do here. - Someone's collecting ears. - You got any hunches? - A couple. I know sooner or later, something's gotta give. - Look, how about if I get a hold of some of my people down in Chinatown. See if they know anything. - That'd be great. - Meantime, let's forget about it. Let's go have some fun tonight. (lively percussive music) - Tom, Tom, excuse me, Tom. Some people over here I'd like you to meet. Romo and Lena, I'd like you to meet Tom Stevens, he's the man I was telling you about. Romo and Lena Aligosha. - Hello-- - Tom, a man who I think you could possibly spend some time with, quite probably. He's running for councilman. He used to be, well still is, in fact, a detective. A fine, upstanding man. And we're looking to make him a councilman in the near future. And in fact, we're counting on your support. - You'll have our support. - (chuckles) Well, we can probably meet to discuss this at some further length. - How much they need for your campaign. - That's exactly what we were hoping to hear. Well, good then, we'll look forward to seeing you, we'll make an appointment-- - Send someone to see me. (lively percussive music) (midtempo electronic music) - Lee. - Mm. - Only you can come. - Wait here, I'll be right back. (suspenseful electronic music) - Hey! (kick smacks) (hit thuds) (hit thuds) (water splashes) (punch thuds) (hits smack) (man shouts in foreign language) (men speak in foreign language) - I'm sorry, we'll get your purse back. No worry, I'll stay here. Dr. Lo will take you to Chin. - Mr. Chin. - Buddha peace. - I don't believe you know Inspector Sleighton. - Only by reputation. Tell me. You must be the lady called Silk. - I am. - This way, please. I assure you, Captain Stevens, Carnahan was not killed by any of my family. No one can tell me who put the contract on him. - We know he was involved in a drug operation. - Small time. He worked with a Hong Kong Organization called Gemini Syndicate. - Never heard of him. - Ah. This young lady was a friend of Mr. Carnahan. (gentle electronic tones) - What is this? - A list of names written by Carnahan himself only a few days ago. - Pay dirt. - Look at that, Billy Shamura right up on top. - Yeah. - May I keep this? - We have a description of the killers. - Two men. They were dressed like, like soldiers. (ominous electronic tones) One of them was wearing sunglasses. - At night? - Yes. One of the men was very big. 6 1/2 feet. The other guy was big, too. Probably six feet. (can clatters) (suspenseful electronic music) - Well, look who's here. Come on in, Pappy. Make yourself at home. Hey, Pappy, what's the matter, ain't you gettin' any kicks? (crickets chirp) Sit. - I oughta tear your fuckin' asses off. You're only supposed to supposed to scare McKenna. And then you tag that punk in Chinatown, didn't you? (man laughs) You must be outta your fuckin' minds. (men laugh) - Yeah, we must be! - I wanna know who hired you. - You better fuckin' get this straight, Stevens. I ain't tellin' you a damn thing! This is our puppy dog. And you ain't got nothin' to say about it. You understand? - You're gonna get yourself hooked, buddy boy. - No, we got you hooked. - We got you by the balls, tiger. You taught us the tricks. We killed those dudes on your say-so. - God damn you, Vernon. I thought I could trust you. - Fuckin' self-righteous moron. You think it's all right to splat outlaws just because they beat your wrath. - The system's fucked, we all know that. - They beat you at your own game, and you can't stand it! - God damn you, Tyler, don't pull this crap on me! I saved a stinky, worthless life. If it wasn't for me, neither one of you shitheads would be here. - No, no, no, no, no, uh-uh. We ain't in Vietnam no more. We don't owe you horse sweat! - What the hell's the hang up here? We got four killings, all the same touch. It's the same killer, simple, right? Come on guys, the chief's hounding me about this. - Well, we know Carnahan was a smuggler for Gemini. - What we don't know is what he was moving. It certainly wasn't just drugs. - [Keno] What about the Tong? - They don't know anything about the Gemini Operations. - Except that they're trying to muscle into The States out of Hong Kong. - Chin gave us the name of their front. The Eastern Star Trading Company. - It's owned by an international consortium called Hong Kong Holding. Principle shareholders, a British citizen named Austin lives here now. - You're late, Captain. All right, I want a 24-hour surveillance put on Eastern Star. I want you to go over the report, Stevens. I need your appraisal. - Ran all the names on Carnahan's list through our computers. We don't have anything. - Nothing at all? - No police records? - They're all clean. So, I plugged into the county computer terminals, asked for birth records. Every name is in there. (traffic hums) - Hey Silk, check this out. - Fullback, who's available for a tail? - Yeah, Sly Dog here. I got 'em. (suspenseful electronic music) - Okay, who followed up on this guy? - That's me. They're with a wiring firm called Electric City. They're for real. - [Tom] But wait a minute, who's this little guy? - Oh, I followed him. Lives in Nanakuli Street, names Katsuyo Tanaka, that's all I have on him. - Oh wait a minute. - All right, keep it goin'. - Wait a minute. - What do you got? - Katsuyo Tanaka, right here on the list. (group cheers) - Woo! - There you are! - Yashi, let's go. (man hums melodically) (door knocks) - [Yashi] Mr. Tanaka? - Yes? - Police. - There's been a series of burglaries in the building, Mr. Tanaka. Mind if we have a look around? - [Katsuyo] No. - Well, it looks like somebody's been foolin' around with this lock. Take a look at this. (suspenseful electronic tones) - You seen any suspicious looking characters in the hallway or in the alley? - No. - The service personnel come to check your plumbing or your wiring? - No. - [Yashi] Anything like that? - What line of work are you in, Mr. Tanaka? - Independent trader, financial management. - Thank you. You've been very kind. Let's go, Yashi. (suspenseful electronic music) - What's crackin'? - I wanna keep an eye on him. See what he does next. - He's watching us right now. - Perfect. - We got him nervous. - Yep. - Hello, Mr. Stromberg? - [Mr. Stromberg] Yes? - Tanaka here. The police were here asking questions. - There's nothing to worry about, Mr. Tanaka. But just to be on the safe side, I think we oughta pull you out of circulation. - Oh you take care of me, right? - Of course. And in the meantime, you cannot stay in your apartment. I want you to leave tonight. Go out the back way, make sure you're not followed, right? - [Tanaka] Right. - Remember the Tradewinds Emporium in Kamiah Mall? - Yes. - [Mr. Stromberg] I'll send a couple of my men to pick you up at seven o'clock. - Okay, okay, I'll be there. (suspenseful electronic music) - Come in Fullback, you got Sidewinder here. Looks like this bozo's playin' a hell of a waiting game. What do you wanna do? - Stay put. Looks like we got some backdoor action here. Standby. - Taxi. - He's getting a cab. I'll follow. (engine hums) Stay nice and tight, Sidewinder. - We got you, Fullback. (midtempo electronic music) (crowd murmurs) (gentle electronic tones) - Mr. Tanaka? This way. (suspenseful electronic music) - Wait, police, run! (uptempo electronic music) - [Brown] Hold it, Tanaka, police! Hold it! (gun fires) (gun fires) (shoppers scream) (suspenseful electronic music) - Hold it! (gun fires) (weapon fires) (uptempo electronic music) (hit thuds) (man groans) (man screams) (ominous electronic music) (crowd murmurs) - Well, I lost him. - Let's go. - We lost Yamamoto last night. Cops had him downtown. - Oh, damn it. We'll have to get to him. - (sighs) I say we use a lawyer. Get him out on bail before he talks. - Hm, or else we shan't have much leeway. - [Mr. Stromberg] I'm afraid not. - All right, phone Douglas. - All right. (computer clicks) (suspenseful electronic music) - Hey babe. (Tom breathes heavily) What's up? - Vernon. Gustaf K. USMC, LRRP. First force recon company attached to the first Marine Corps division. - I don't know what you're talkin' about. ID verification came back on the Kamiah Mall stiff. - What'd you say the name was? - Vernon, Gus. Sound familiar? - Should it? Okay. I'll bite. Suppose you tell me what you got. - You served in the same unit in 'Nam. - You're kidding. Vietnam? I don't remember it. - You sure about that? - Look, I just said so, didn't I, huh? You're talkin' about a company roster of 150 grunts. I don't recall the dude. - The tunnel rats. It's too bad. I was hoping you could tell me where to find them. - Hold it, Jenny. - No, you hold it. Don't you think I know when you're lying to me? - You don't know what the hell you're talkin' about. - You must be in some real deep shit, huh? - You know, I think you're obsessed with this case. - What are you hiding? What is going on? - You just back off, huh? - Look. Level with me, I can help you! - Look, I don't wanna hurt you. But if comes to it, I'll mow you down and not even think about it, so just back off. - What happened with Tanaka? - He just got bailed out. (ominous electronic music) (engine hums) (tires screech) (midtempo electronic music) (tires screech) (tires screech) - Hey, this not way to airport. (tires screech) (dramatic electronic music) (guns fire) (Tyler screams) - Freeze! (gun fires) (gun fires) (Tyler groans) - Tyler! Don't be an idiot! (doors thud) (tires screech) (engine revs) - We got a make on the car, but it hasn't been seen since. We did put out the APBS. - Stay with it. If anybody needs me, I'll be with the specials. - [Man] Give me the file. - [Man] Hey Rossad, you wanna find car or what? - I'm over here! (men chatter) - Come on, come on, hustle. - What's with this, Mike? - [Man] Well I talked to this guy over at, uh, Kamuela, and he told me that he had no idea. - [Man] Oh no. - [Man] We're running out of-- - I want a dragnet! I want you people calling every contact you've got in town. We gotta have help on this. (workers chatter) - Okay, Tanaka. Have you figured it out yet? The Gemini Syndicate wants you dead. - It's impossible. - Well why don't you tell us about it? - I bought my new name from them. Why would they want to kill me. - What'd he say? - You bought a new identity from them? - Yes. - Keep him talkin', I'll get a Steno. Tell Johnson to follow up on this now. - Boss. Listen. I think we got him. - It's about time. - Now that you gave us the key to the whole racket. - All right, now get this. The US citizen, Oriental, dies in private. - Can't be in a hospital or anyplace where authorities can report it. - Then Gemini steps in and buys the identity from the survivors in exchange for their silence. - Their bodies are disposed of, and the ID is kept alive in county records, till it's safe to sell it off. - [Tom] The Carnahan list is a list of dead people. - How does Tanaka fit in? - [Yashi] He's an accomplice of the Yakuza. Real name's Yamamoto. - He gave us the names of everyone in the organization he came in contact with. - Who's the top dog? - It's gotta be this big-shot limey Austin. And that's where she's gotta be. - Commander, phone, line one. Some guy named Austin. - Austin? - I have your officer, and you're not getting her back until I have your fullest cooperation. I have my own transportation at the airport, and what I need is aerial clearance for the next 90 minutes. - You go to hell. - I want no interference, Commander. I want that air strip as clean as Good Friday. Otherwise, the policewoman dies. I know you're gonna try, but I want no SWAT teams out there. Shall we agree? - Agreed. - Hey, I don't trust those bullshit cops. - They don't trust you either, jackass. - They have to. You know, I don't know why they call you Silk. - 'Cause I'm so fuckin' smooth. - Gonna waste this bitch. - Stop, call the pilot, and tell him to warm up the engines. - I'll get things moving. - Take her away. - Come on, baby, this is gonna be a gas. (midtempo electronic music) (traffic hums) - Unit one, ready? - [Officer] Okay, we're coming. - Unit two, hold your positions. Come in, Sidewinder. - Yo. - You're on. - That's us. Silk, go! (guns fire) - I need a horn! Hold your fire! (helicopter whirs) Oh, Austin! Listen to me! Take me! Take me! Let the woman go and take me! - I knew he was dumb, but I didn't know he was this dumb. You know, we used to crease for this guy. - Kill him, now! Go on! (ominous music) (gun clicks) (guns fire) (guns fire) - Go! (guns fire) - Go, damn it, go!
