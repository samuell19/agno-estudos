For he's a jolly good fellow, for he's a jolly good fellow which nobody can deny. My dear friends. I thank you. It was so touching of you to remember my birthday. And I thank you. Nail. Hammer. In the name of the French Republic, I call Henry Charles Lightman. Sir Henry Charles Lightman has been condemned to death for murder and is to be guillotined this day of march 24. The prisoner has not requested a plea for clemency. In his place he wouldn't have either. Are you drunk, sir? I hereby pronounce justice shall be done. And now, executioner, will you do your duty. Please take this man to his cell. You haven't heard the last of this! 8 years later this nail was to cost the lives of 25 persons. Don't turn around. Straight ahead! Keep driving and don't take your eyes off the road, mylady. Keep driving I told you! Who are you? What do you want from me? I want to tell you a little story. Once upon a time there was a rich man, a lord. Unfortunately a very old man, 68 years old, to be precise. This man married a young woman, 28 years old, to be precise. I know the story. Alright, here. What do you want me to with it? Help yourself. But don't give me tips, mylady. How much? You are mistaking me I'm not your lover, lady doringham. I don't want money. What then? A souvenir. The doringham necklace. The necklace? You can't be serious! My husband... Wouldn't notice it. Oh, it wasn't easy, but the imitation is good. Don't you think so? Even in my profession we are prepared to make investments. What should I do? Make the exchange, that's all. You'll give me the original. I shall tell you where and when in good time. Alright. - Stop the car here. And this conversation remains between us, understand. It will go easier with you. If you'll go to the police you'll die! The red circle! The red circle! If I haven't seen the police, I can assure you, it's not because I'm scared. I'm not frightened by such silly nonsense. I wouldn't take this too light, we mustn't... Forget it. He's murdered 18 men and women. 19, mr beardmore. That's why I send for you. I will follow your promise, maybe a month in the daily newspaper. Good work, my boy. I don't believe much in private detectives generally, but your exceptional, the way you solved the Sussex-bank thing was positively brilliant. I guess I'm lucky, that's all. Nonsense, lucky. You're fast, alert, intelligent. Qualities we don't find in town. And that's why I'm not anxious to have him handle this... What did you say? I mean have you told them about the letter from the red circle? Of course not. So far it's between the two of us. And this gentleman here... Jack! What's the meaning of this? It seemed to me I heard voices. My nephew, Jack. The last of the beardmore. I wonder sometimes how he came into our family to begin with. Stupid, selfish and lazy. Are you so certain that he's stupid? He's lazy, of that I'm certain. When I think that he inherits everything, when I die... It spoils to play a joke on death. I'm always being accused of using antiquated methods, but no one wants to face the fact that people only decide to come to me when it's too late. Everybody is afraid of Scotland yard. They're afraid of the red circle. And of course, you could put it that way. You've seen the news tonight? They repeat the same things from the news at noon. Oh, that's enough. Listen. That London is dirty nobody would really deny, but to find a place as dirty as Scotland yard you'd have to look far and wide and then you might not find it. The traditions of Scotland yard are outlasting their time. A dangerous blackmailer is running wild in our midst. He has got to be seized. But as everyone knows the case is in the hands of our chief-inspector parr, a man with 40 years to his credit, a monument to the history of the police, but monuments ought to be restricted to museums. Truthful exaggeration. Exaggeration? I have been in the service only 39 years and 11 months. Scotland yard, needs new blood! Young officers, competent guys. The minister suggests counselors for chief inspector parr! Scotland yard needs new blood, young officers, competent guys. They're all panicking. And even you. Have a cigar? Yes, thank you. You may be right. How about Derrick Yale. - So. Yes. Perhaps. He's bright. I'm so afraid of the suggestion to make you fuss and fume. Because of Yale? No, because he's a brighter detective. Yes. He's been some times faster than I like to admit. I'll give that to him. He's coming here tomorrow at 10 o'clock. I'd like to have you join us. Yes, of course. I'll be glad to be here. Now, is there anything else? Yes, there is one more thing. I've got to plan. It has a drawback as it completely changes our usual routine. I must request special powers. However I promise it'll bring in results. Excuse me. Yes, who is it? Yes, this is Morton speaking. Oh, sir David! Sir David west, the sculptor. Yes, what's the matter, sir David? Hm. What? Blackmail? Right away. I'll send chief inspector parr. You may not believe it, but he's gone already. Stop or I'll shoot! Well, our friend isn't much of a writer. Yeah, but that's enough. A sheet of paper. Some words clipped out of a magazine, a red circle, and that's all. It's a death sentence. Ah, thanks for coming, mr Yale. I'm pleased to come. This is a great honor. Oh, sure enough for a man like you. Do you know each other? Chief inspector parr, I guess. How do you do? = I'm Derrick Yale. You are a man about whom the city hears a lot and reads a lot. These days are in all the headlines. All of a sudden the papers can't live without me. I seem to become the favorite subject. Mr Yale, have you read the newspaper... About the death of sir David? I happened to be there. Only I'm afraid I was a bit late. Parr's saw the killer. How interesting. I never thought I would see this here... Why? I've seen some exactly like it in Japan. I've never seen those in Europe. It was discovered near the body. Yes, but sir David wasn't a smoker. And look at the knot on this cord. What about it? A seaman's knot. You mean the killer is a seaman. The red circle a seaman? - Couldn't the circle have had an accomplice? We're quite convinced he has. Behind the red circle there's a brilliant violent and ruthless organisation. Right. And this time it's a seaman. Yes, your theory has something to it. No, sir Archibald, I almost forgot. But I have an important client. I'm afraid I must go along now. Oh, that's a shame. May I count on you to remain in contact with inspector parr? Good idea. As a matter of fact perhaps mr parr would come along. Come along? Yes, it would certainly interest you. My client received his third letter from the red circle. And the last letter. And may I ask who this person is? It's old beardmore. What? - Unfortunately. If you know him, you knew he won't give an inch. He refuses to let go a single penny. Tonight at midnight his time is up. Naturally I'll come with you. Beardmore is an idiot. Why didn't he think of informing us? He didn't think about informing you at all, mr parr. And I don't imagine that he'll be all pleased when you appear. But why don't you come along anyway? Inspector parr? I must see you. It's important. I'm sorry, madam, but I have... I'm being blackmailed by the red circle. Johnson? Will you show this lady to my office? I'll come along just as soon as I can. It may be better, if you'll have a little time to prepare the gentleman. Parr! Yes, sir? See, if you can track down the guy. I'll do my very best. You may count on that. Somehow I prefer the usual routine. Fabulous another bull's-eye! Now you try. Not too bad! At least you hit the target. If you practice as I have, you'd soon be better. I'm afraid, you have to ask my boss. The old froyant would be overjoyed to know that his secretary is interested in archery instead of doing his work. I have to go. Oh, come on. Stay a few minutes longer. I got to go. You know how froyant is. I sure do. I could kill him. It is thanks to him, you know. Nonsense. He lets you work like a dog for the few pennies... He's demanding something for his money. But you're not his slave. You've got enough. I can understand that you are after the money. My uncle allows me less in a month than froyant gives you in a week. Then I guess you're a poor millionaire. = I'm not a millionaire. It's my uncle. I'm embarrassed. I must say I don't allow myself the luxury of a poor lover. Tell me now exactly what am I doing wrong, Jack? Wrong, you? With the bow and arrow. Oh, yes. First of all you've got to aim your arrow right here. Always hold it horizontally. And also keep your arms... Not so tight around my shoulders. I'm sure you know how it supposed to be done. But I thought you show me archery. The other I can learn on my own. Alright. No, that's wrong. Keep the arrow down. You know this is an ideal murder-instrument. Anyway, for someone as good as you are. A what? A murderinstrument? Yes, you wear gloves and nobody could ever find out who did it. No one's thought of that. You have quite an imagination. Women have more imagination than a man. And we're more sentimental! That's not a quality of yours, isn't it? You'll never have the honor of knowing. Secretary's don't go well with millionaires. It'll come to a bad end. Depends on who is involved. I've got to go. To work. And you say you're sentimental. Hm, that's a joke! What's wrong? - The red circle. Maybe the forester marks the trees? When we came here this morning, did you see the circle on it then? No. Strange I don't remember it. I'm sure we passed by this tree when we came. We couldn't have missed it. I ask my uncle. Don't worry. So don't you worry. So long. And please don't forget the letters. I'm back now, mr froyant. I've been to the post-office. You're lying. You were with beardmore. And for that I will subtract one hour from your weekly salary. Is it really worth calculating? 1 shilling, 8 pence. You'll never die of hunger. No one is going to cheat me. As if anybody could, mr froyant. Take my advice and remain civil. Be careful you don't get the place all smeared with that paint. Fresh red paint. What if take the whole office red, would you like that? You knew I was in the park, but you were in the park too, weren't you? Excuse me, please, but I'm looking for the beardmore house. I'm his nephew. It's a bit of luck, happy to know you. My name is marles, Felix marles. You're a friend of my uncle? Not precisely, but we're often in corresponds. I export wood. I'll be glad to give you a lift! Enchanté! Go around to the other side. Thank you. I have to say, I'm interested in your uncle's house. This house? - Not this one. He has a big warehouse on the themse... Ah, the one on the themse. Yes, of course. Any idea why your uncle won't sell? No, it's been empty for a long time. But it's exactly what I need. Have you already written to my uncle? Time and time again, but he's obstinate. That is precisely why I'm coming here. I want to try to persuade your uncle. Is anything wrong? Yes, my heart. You can rest in the house a moment, sir. I'd rather not go inside. I'll come back later. I'm sure it's nothing at all. I'll walk around the block a little and get some fresh air. It's the best medicine. Alright, if that's what you want. Uncle, tell me, do you know a man called marles, Felix marles, a French man? Only by correspondence. Well, he's here. He's here, but he's out in the park, getting a bit of air. He said he had a heart-attack the minute he arrived. But... But? In my opinion it was only a pretext. I think the man was frightened. Frightened? I can't really be sure of it, but I certainly got that impression. We haven't had the pleasure? Chief inspector parr of Scotland yard. I hope you don't mind him being here. Detectives sometimes know best what is really good for their clients. I see, I expected those actions from you. I'm not here simply to annoy you. Yes, I know. Anyway, now you are here. You've been told the details... When we examined the tree on which you discovered the red circle. Are you sure that the circle wasn't there in the first place when you passed by. Miss drummond, she remembered it clearly. Then I'm afraid we're forced believe one of two things. On the one hand miss drummond is telling the truth, on the other she's lying. Even if you are at Scotland yard. You have no right to accuse someone you don't know. Didn't you say the name was drummond? Could it be Thalia drummond? That's right, do you know her? Oh, only from publication. What do you mean? She's in the publication sometimes. She's wanted by interpol. This young person is a known thief and suspected of a dozen robberies. Somebody it's an honor to know. Yes, indeed. The accusation can't be true. Jack, we're not here to discuss mr froyants secretary. So don't worry. At the present moment she's not important. No, but maybe later. Listen! We are here to protect your uncle at this very night with murder. No, darling. Please don't be angry. I must be going home now. I don't want to argue with my husband. Alright. I've got a feeling we're going to have trouble. What a bloody mess. This morning she stopped at Scotland yard. Oh, you didn't tell me about it. The chief inspector isn't that open. He probably has his reasons. Especially with you, sergeant haggett. Chief inspector parr gave us instructions that we should observe lady doringham. He must have known she was in danger. He knew she was. And why did he let this thing happen? Sergeant, come here for a minute. Sir, I wonder if I could ask you to have a look over here, please. Now, what is it? Something that would interest you. The circle! Burned with a cigarettelighter. Do you know where inspector parr is? I don't have the honor of knowing much of the chief inspector's actual plans, but I do think I've heard that he'll be at mr beardmore's house tonight. Inspector parr has a talent for being at a place where nothing is happening. I wouldn't be so sure, sir. It's midnight. All is in order, sir. The police have the property surrounded. And that inspector parr? Went upstairs. Mr Yale? At his post as planned and Jack is sleeping, sir. - Ah. Don't make a move! I can see youl! Come out at once! Come on, I say with your hands in the air! I'll count to three! If you don't I'll shoot! One... Two... Hey, hey! Come on, you! This way, boys! This way! Over here! I told him he was not to go out of the house. The murderer must certainly be an excellent Archer. Right. And we also knew the fingerprints wouldn't be left on the weapon. Because... an Archer always wears gloves. Yes, precisely. Have you read the latest audition? I believe I've gotten bad critics? Well, sir. They haven't praised you. Sir, I don't want to be impolite, but I was leaving just now anyway. Don't imagine that I only decided to leave when you appeared. Don't imagine I'm sorry to see you, haggett. Quite a night, parr! Yes, it's a damn shame. We had bad luck. Bad luck you call it? Three murders in 24 hours. If that's the result of your new plan, my congratulations. Oh, you have more possibilities than any other man of Scotland yard you been given priority, and we don't want to hear what the minister says. I have my plan. You must be patient with me. I'm not a magician. It takes a little time. I can't wait very much longer, parr. I respect your methods, but in this particular case... Well, have you better ones? I don't know. But maybe you're interested in... Yes, come on with me. You say you don't know why you committed the crime. You want us to believe that? But it's a fact, sir. It was some mysterious character who ordered you to... You see that man? - Who is he? His name's Selby. We just picked him up in a seaman's rooming-house. He's confessed the murder of sir David. What do you say to that part? Good morning, mr Yale. I never disputed the skill and accomplishment of mr Yale. Where is the circle of yours? Under the bed? The last time that I've been trying to break him down and find out who oh, but now that you're here. Who was it who told you that you were to murder sir David west? I said I don't know, chief. If I ask your name you know what it was. Sure, chief. Glad to hear it. I thought your answer was a little strange. I know, chief. But if you know that much then I suppose you're equally aware that you could be hanged for this. Maybe not a seaman's knot to be hanged? Me? Did you expect to get a gold star? No, but I was only hired to do it. I just bumped into a man with a mask, at the harbour, it was foggy. He told me that he knew me. But that's all I know, chief. Now, you ask for it. We might as well get the dead-cell ready. Chief. Maybe I know something else. But no more fog! The man had a peculiar laugh. A laugh? Like what? I can't describe it, chief. Like this? Johnson, give us a laugh. Really! No, not like that. Lentil soup with mashed potatoes. What are you doing here, haggett? I brought the prisoner's meal. It's exactly 12 o'clock. Wait outside. After the questioning. Oh, I'm sorry, sir. But we cannot break the prison-regulations. I've had quite enough of this nonsense. I'm sorry, sir. I'm not responsible for the rules. Am I then? You don't have to go far. Gentlemen, we wait outside. It looks as if we have 10 minutes pause. I'm sorry, sir, but the official regulations are 15 minutes, you know. Congratulations, that was a master-piece. That clue about the men's laugh was encouraging. All we needed was to get this unknown man, who stands behind Selby. Pardon, we need people who can laugh. Difficult to find at Scotland yard. Yes, indeed. Who asked for your opinion? A doctor! A doctor! Someone call a doctor, quick! The seaman Selby is dead. Dead? Cyanide. But I tasted the food! That was the quickest funeral I've been to in all my life. The priest must have had some other engagement. The minute after he began he was already saying amen. I asked for a short ceremony at my uncle's request. All I can see you're not taking your uncle's demise too hard. It's terribly sad, but that's all. Yes, but he was your uncle. He was very casual in our relationship. Should I now try to affect sorrow? All his money goes to you. You're now a rich man. That's not a reason to be sad. But someone cried nevertheless. Ah, you must mean the veiled woman. You happen to know who she is? I've no idea. Is that the truth? Stop, please. There's someone we all know. Thalia? Thalia drummond! What she's doing in the pawnshop? Money, I guess. With the salary she gets from froyant, it's not surprising at all. I'd love to know what she's pawned here. Does it make any difference? With anybody else I would say "no". But in her case it does make a difference. It certainly is an item of great value. From the ming dynasty... Somewhere in the 14th century. You asked for me, sir? Was there something you wished? This Buddha was here this morning in my library. A good place for him. As I khow I have the police service to thank. Very competent people. I have lodged a complaint against you for robbery. Oh. Anything to say in your defense, miss? I can only say that mr froyant certainly is the worst employer that I know. He refused to raise my wages. I had my reasons. They were very good reasons, I might add. Therefore you stole the statue? I had every intention of returning it. Well, now you won't have to bother. Kindly return the keys given to you and immediately pack your suitcase. I want you to leave my house in 1/2 hour. Oh, by the way: I checked the mail. It is my pleasure to have this last duty. And to be able to pass on this official action to you. Well, that'll be all. Thank you. Have you any idea what type of investments would interest you? I just inherited this money. I feel I must do some investigation before I make up my mind on what I have to do. First of all you think of your child. Yes. As myself this is not so important. You're quite right. But a woman like you won't stay widow for very long. Widow is not quite the right word. It was not my husband who passed away. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be asking... You personal questions on such matters. Now, I'll be happy to think about it for a while. Thank you. I see you later? You will. Whenever you wish. You'll be welcome any time. No businessman could be so pleasant. Sometimes... When it comes to business-matters. I hope you're not in my case. Of course not. What you're doing outside my door? Oh, this is your door? What did you think it was? Did you realize that your office is in the beardmore building? Naturally. Of course I do... mommy! Mr beardmore was murdered. And do you happened to know about that too? I've heard about it. That's just great. Then I can go away. Mr Osborne! Have you forgotten that I'm here? What a question, certainly not. You there! Wait! Stop where you are! I want to help you! Help me? It wouldn't be very easy. It will cost me 5.000 pounds. How do you know that? Isn't it absurd for a bank-president to commit suicide for 5.000 pounds. It may sound absurd for you because you're not in my situation. It's your fault, for speculating with your clients money the fool you are here is 5.000 pounds. Tomorrow morning you can restore what you borrowed. Listen, what have I to do for this money? Something you're very good at. Spend it. I want those bills to circulate. = that's alll is it? You must use a little careful. The police have certainly written the bill-numbers down. Aha. Oh, now I understand. Don't understand too much, brabazon. It would be unhealthy. And now go! I want to speak to you. Where do I get in touch with you? No one has ever known nor needed to know where did you get in touch with me. Hello! Oh, hello! You know I'm out of a job. Of course Jack beardmore offered me to work for him. I'd rather not. Froyant was disagreeable, but at least he didn't want to make love. So now I'm jobless. Where? Hello! Hello! Hello! Thalia drummond! How do you know me? I want to discuss a new job with you. But not on the street, in this weather! Get in the back. Aren't you afraid? I'm not afraid of anyone. The only thing I'm afraid of is not having any money. As long as you work for me that's one thing you'll never fear. But if you ever try to get smart... I'm worried about your pretty head. I was only trying to light my cigarette. What are you offering? If it's enough I don't care how I get it. That's a good approach, but I give you no choice. That's about the way I thought it was. For this mission 100 pounds. And what have I to do? Keep watching a certain man. Tomorrow morning you will start on your job. As somebody's watchdog? As a cashier in the brabazon bank. With such pretty little hands you shouldn't be working, mademoiselle. Well, counting money isn't work to me, mr marles. On the contrary. It's my greatest joy. That's 450 pounds. Will you count them, please? I'm one of those persons who trust others, miss drummond. Where did you learn my name? I'm interested in you. Don't think you're the only one. How about going out with me and helping me to spend this lovely money? I'd like to know where you wanna go. We could go out for lunch. I'll give you a call. Yes, I got a lot to talk to you about. Would you be good enough to give me some change for this? I'd suggest you better check the money. I guess I have to confess that money just seems to have a way of clinging to me. So it's you? Is it? Yes. That's right. In person. How did you ever get in here? By connections, mr Yale. I'm astonished to see you as cashier. Many people would be astonished. Brabazon know all about you? I didn't tell him. Will you tell him? It's my duty. I guess I cannot prevent it. We could discuss the matter at lunch. In more comfortable atmosphere. I know very little about such things. This could be called blackmail. Persuasion. With extenuating circumstances, after all you're so pretty. I'm really very sorry, but somebody has already asked me for lunch. I call you within an hour. Brabazon bank, Thalia drummond. Are you alone? Yes. It's the lunch-break. Brabazon put out the entire regulation. Nobody from the yard has shown up here, but Derrick Yale asked me to have lunch with him. But so did someone else, a French man, Felix marles. Let Yale drop. Accept marles invitation. Bring him to the beardmore building. You'll find an excuse. You understand? Yes, but Derrick was more attractive. Go out with Yale on Sunday. You give the orders, chief. That sounded like a shot. It was a shot. Did it hit you? No, but there's some damage. What happened, mr Yale? Did you see who did it? No, I didn't, but I know who it was. You mean, the red circle? It was. - What do you do about? Scotland yard has a new employee. Hm. You don't seem to be hungry. There's a small favor I have to ask you. We have to celebrate the conclusion of the contract. Thank you. Don't you think it would be better if your daughter had been able to come with us? People so quickly get false ideas. Yes, but Dorothy has to go to school. Terrible. To what school did she go? To the cavendish institute. I know what you mean? At finshely? No, not at finshley. The Chelsea-section. = hm, Chelsea. Waiter. - Yes, sir? That gentleman with the lady by the window, does he come here often? It's the first time. I think he's French. Yes, I knew him in Toulouse. Who is that man who keeps staring at us? A lover, I'm supposed to have disappointed him, I'm afraid. Of all the objects, that beardmore has inherited, the old warehouse at the themse interests me the most. I think I can pass it on to you. Jack beardmore will do absolutely anything he thinks it would please me. Give me 10% of the gross-income, and I will help you to see him at once. Don't you have to get back to work? Oh, for a little extra money trust me to find a good excuse. Well, that's... good. Old snooper! You know inspector parr? He loves to arrest me from time to time. I always feel as if we're related. Where is his office? Third floor on the right. Please, after you. That won't help him much. It'll come right back again. Yes, but do you think he will? He could get out on another floor. I wouldn't advise it you know. In marles room I found a pair of shoes in the fireplace. They were burnt. In fact identical to those in the park of beardmore. Somehow he doesn't seem like a killer. He's coming down, of his own free will. Stop him! Stop him! Inspector! I'm ticklish. Are you going to a masquerade-ball, haggett? A perfect disguise, isn't it? Have you gotten crazy? What's the meaning of this childish nonsense? I had to keep an eye on marles, but always as haggett? Did you see the other one? I saw him but I can't recognize him. He was on the fourth floor. But I'd certainly caught him if I... If what? If what? If my dear colleagues would just have left me alone. Alright. That's enough pictures for now. Take away the body. Watch out! Watch out! I'm beginning to believe it's just a little bit dangerous to stay in your general surroundings, inspector. I didn't ask you to come down. You can return to your office. A murder took place on my own property. A man who had lunch with your girlfriend. I'm glad I'm not in your shoes. We'll probably ask you officially to work with us together. I'd rather not be a police-man. I can understand that fully. Did you know the man who was murdered? Oh, only by sight. Red circle again? For all we know, why not? I examined the murder weapon. It's a venetian dagger. Like the one we saw in froyants office. By the way there was another interesting detail. My deduction let me to believe the murderer is undoubtedly left-handed. And one thing more. Now would you let me see you bag? As far as I know you're not at yard. But soon, look here. Who gave you the right... =-just a moment! That sir... that's what mr brabazon gave me. Why that's so extraordinary? These are counterfeit banknotes. The red circle took them from one of his victims. He's made a really fine job. Me? We ask your chief. And don't you dare... The bird has flown the Coop. He didn't leave a single penny. My chief is very thoroughly. You're in luck this time, but we'll find this bravazon eventually. And let me know when you have him. Look, you stole that money, didn't you? What if I did? How do you suppose the barbazon things made a fortune? Many thanks for the lesson, parr. If you want to insist on trying to figure out devious ways to get money trying hard to find one that will work. All your schemes have failed up to now. All of my schemes? How did you know that? Chief inspection... Send the detail of barbazon. And issue a warrant for his arrest. What will you do now? Oh, I'll find another job. How about coming to work for me? For you? - Hm. Are you sure your nerves could take it? Oh, I've always checks with me and my cash-box is empty. Well, with so much trusting, I cannot refuse. Then, I'll expect you tomorrow morning. Gentlemen. A good day. See you tomorrow. Did you really mean to hire that girl? In that way I'll keep an eye on her. That's not the real reason. Jack beardmore realized that whenever you're near, the red circle always seems to take place. He wasn't entirely involved. Yes. But it's not only you. You will see that this miss drummond is in the background too. Brabazon! Scotland yard will never find you here. Go into the room at the end of the corridor. There's everything you need, but try and leave this warehouse without my instructions, and you are a dead man. My client has received his third blackmail = from the red circle? If it was a love-letter you think I would have call Scotland yard, inspector? I hope I'm not imposing on you, mr froyant. And let me warn you not to contact the police or you're a dead man. I know how to read english too. Excuse me, if this should spoil your appetite, but you ought to leave 50.000 pounds on Friday, 6 o'clock, in the office of your bodyguard Yale should the money not be there he will not live to see the next morning. He doesn't make a joke, does he? Don't you think, Yale, that the red circle went too far this time? They say every murderer makes a mistake. = you believe that this is the first? I certainly hope, sir. Well, what are you going to do? You're going to draw from your bank 50.000 pounds in cash, mr froyant. 50.000 pounds. It must have been hard on the old gent. As hard as it is for another millionaire. All clear? - All clear, sir. And where is your charming assistant? = you mean miss drummond? I send her with mail to the train station. It will take her a couple of hours. Very good. Nobody can come in here? I think I taken care of everything. Only a mountain goat can get up there. Have you posted someone on the roof? Haggett is on top across the street. There is no danger from this side. We don't have to worry about the roof. No. Anyone who tries to get in here will have to pass the secretary's office. And what if he gets by your man who's posted in the hallway? It's impossible. He must go through the outer office. And in the outer office it will be yours truly. And for him to get by me, he needs to think up something special. Well, no red circle in the closet? No, I didn't see any. One more thing: If the telephone should ring, I wouldn't answer it. Yale, Yale! Are you alright, Yale? Hello, parr. Thank god. Are you alright? Do you think you can stand? I think so. The money, it's gone. Damn it. He must have sneaked around behind me. I heard a noise in the hallway. I went to see what it was and everything went black. The window. - It was closed. All I can see is the mail-man. = the mail-man? Did you recognize the man in the car that's pulling off? No. But the car. - Hm. The car is Osborne's car. = isn't he in the office next door? Hmhm. I suppose he did it. He figured he get the money out of the building as quickly as possible. And not be caught personally. Knowing the building he was bound to realize. He could slide it down the slit. Exactly. And the mail-man could pick it up in his regular rounds. It's waist of time to look for him. And the mailman is lying in some ditch. Something happened, sir? Everything is just fine and dandy. You can go back to sleep. But we really can be sure... Nobody would get in the building. I can just imagine what sir Archibald will say when he hears this one. Yes, and mr froyant also isn't going to be altogether happy. It's not going to be easy to explain... And if you switch places. We'll get experts up here. Maybe they'll find something. Hello, this is parr. Send the fingerprints to Derrick Yale's office. It's in the beardmore building. Yes. Yes, I'm here. I'll be waiting. They should be here in no time. They won't have to wait very long. Right, inspector. Excuse me, for bothering you like this. Your Mrs. Carlyle, right? You've got to help me, mr beardmore. I would never have dreamed of coming here if it wasn't about Dorothy. Dorothy? My daughter. And your uncle's daughter. I see. I'm beginning to understand. You must help me, mr beardmore. My child has disappeared! She didn't return from school. Perhaps she's out with some friends... That's what I thought. I've been to every conceivable place in the neighbourhood. And? And then, when I returned home, I found this letter: "If you want to see Dorothy again do not contact with police or Derrick Yale. The attached outline shows where you ought to meet me tomorrow at midnight. Bring 10.000 pounds. The red circle." Here's the outline. What shall I do, mr beardmore? What shall I do? You won't like but I would say: Pay! Is that your answer? Yes, Mrs. Carlyle. You must. One ticket to Toulouse. France? You know a Toulouse anywhere else? No, sir. I don't. No. One way. Here you are. Thank you. Wait for your turn! Scotland yard. What did he want? The old man? - Yes. Masquerade. Take that mask away from your face. Mummy! Let me go! - Be quiet! Mummy, mummy! - Be quiet! Stop or I'll shoot! Stop! No! I'm happy to announce to you that in view of your consistently good behaviour you have been reprieved and released. Give this man's his clothes back. This is a tribute to the new methods I use. Please excuse this interruption. The morning of lightmans execution... The executioner was drunken. Yes, I'm afraid he was, this is the only time it ever happened. Didn't I tell you to leave us alone. Oh, there's no way to escape. We thought there was no way, but he did escape. He was clever. Didn't I say to leave us alone? Thank you so much for your help. If any other reporter should come here, do refuse them any information. You can rely on me. And besides, you now possess the documents. We don't have duplicates. Splendid. That's exceedingly kind. And now I must be on my way home. Perhaps you stay a bit longer. If I remember some other details. Sorry, I've got to take the 7.40-train. Tomorrow I must be in London again. Go on with your business. You said he was a journalist? Yes. If that man's a journalist, sir, then I'm a chorus-girl in the follies bergéres. But he presented his press ID. No doubt. And there upon you gave him all the documents of the Lightman-case? It is such an old case. It is for you. For us it isn't. I see. That's something I didn't know. Did you know Lightman personally? I was just a young official. I can't remember what he looked like. Did he resemble the man today, who was here a minute ago? Absurd. Out of the question. Unless... one never knows. Anyway, you can look at him yourself. He's leaving on the 7.40-train to London. The 7.40, you say. I'm afraid, no train leaves for London before 10 o'clock, sir. Stay where you are. Are you alone? Yes. Put the money on the rock beside you. First my daughter. I told you to put the money on the rock. Mommy! Mommy, mommy. The train to London stops here for one minute. Now whats wrong, haggett. I was checking the train. I thought you get on in Rochester. If I'd had the time, haggett, I would have got on board to Dover. I was sitting in there. Froyant two compartment ahead can you see him? Tell me first what you found out. Your presumption was correct, chief. Tea? Sandwich, sir? = sandwich. Oh... tea also. One and six, sir. The executioner was drunk. He took out the protecting nail. Lightman was reprieved. Devils island. Five years later he escaped. So Lightman is our man. Yes. Naturally. Marles. You had it figured out alright. He was the only one who wasn't being blackmailed. And marles was his accomplice but then testified against Lightman. When they met. It was a duel. But marles lost that day. Yes, he got stabbed with a dagger now, give me the documents I'm afraid I don't have them. Froyant told the warden he was a journalist. Come on. You'll go and pay the gentleman a little visit now. I'm curious to learn... What explanation he has for his trip to France. You got here just in time, inspector. Poisoned. Did you serve tea in his compartment? Not yet, sir. I began at the other end. Scotland yard. You're quite sure? You can check on me, sir. I've been serving this line for 20 years. Who pulled the emergencybreak? I did. Scotland yard. Try to find a doctor and also make sure that nobody gets off. How shall I do that? In apartment 6 is a dead man. Thalia! Forget that you ever saw me, Jack. Forget it? But how can I? You must... it's essential, believe me. And you must also forget the letter of froyant particularly. Who do you take me for? What have you've done with that letter? You have to promise to tell no one about the letter, Jack. The letter! Stay there. Don't make a move. I can't tell you... Thalia! Look at that. Each flag represents a crime, committed by the red circle. And you have the impudence to ask me to try and keep the secret? The passengers of the train know it! But they've no idea of what happened. The doctor. Professional secret. And the reporters. They could have spread it all over London. Only climsey of the "star" knows. But I have an agreement with him. What kind of agreement? If I don't turn over to in the name of the red circle within 24 hours, then you can have the froyant case. Ah, and you think, you'll be able to do that within 24 hours. I'm sure I can. And I will. You haven't got 24 hours anymore, parr. The minister's fired you. Tonight at midnight you have to go, and your career is over in Scotland yard. Then I've only got 13 hours now... 10. Nine minutes. That may be enough. Parr. Why not try to face the facts? Your master mind plan is a failure we both know it is a failure. Now with froyant your going to be broken. The plan will break the red circle. And for that I need a warrant. A warrant for whom? I ask you to sign a blank warrant. I can't do it. And you know that, parr. Sir, this is my last day. Alright. Come back to see me in 10 minutes. Good morning, mr beardmore. Sleep well last night? No, I didn't. You know why, too. You didn't sleep well because of me? I'm sorry. It won't happen again. I won't let you spoil another night's sleep for me. Thalia! Give me froyants letter! I must have it now! You should be glad I took. Please forget it, Jack. Please. Yes, but... I don't want you to be hurt by this. All I care about is that nothing ever happens to you. You must try to believe me, Jack. How can I? Give me back the letter. You being stupid, Jack. You might try to understand. I haven't got the letter anymore, I gave it away. To whom? Who are you working for? What kind of tricks are you playing? That's exactly what I'd like to know. Hello, Jack beardmore. We have a couple of questions. Questions? Why me? Will you please leave us alone. I'm honored by your curtesy. Since I'm working for mr Yale nobody wants to know the contents of my bag. See you later, mr Yale. 2 days ago the daughter of Mrs. Carlyle was kidnapped. The child is 6. You were present when Mrs. Carlyle gave the money to the kidnapper, I believe. No. - No? Your footprints were discovered in the vicinity. And these are your shoes. We made search of your house. Alright. I admit they're my shoes. But I'm not the kidnapper, nor the red circle. That would mean that I was the one who killed my uncle James. That's absurd. Why? Didn't you have a motive? You are the sole heir, aren't you? I'm not the sole heir, mr parr. That's true. And it surprised you, that your uncle gave an amount of the money to Mrs. Carlyle. But you don't think serious about that. Why not, Jack? Why were your footprints at the scene? I followed to see if I could recognize the red circle. Did you recognize him? No. But I was able to see his car perfectly. A dark Morris with searchlights on the left side. Excellent. Before we can locate this car, you will have to come with us I'm afraid. We have to take you to Scotland yard. Johnson! You're making a big mistake, inspector. I've made many mistakes in my life. One more doesn't matter anymore. Well, just give me an hour or two... Not another second, Jack. You see that's the one mistake I do not want to make. Yale, I believe we ought to go into the warehouse of old James beardmore. Are you so sure that that's where little Dorothy was being kept in. Absolutely. - Inspector! Look, that's the car. I told you about it. In any case it's a dark red Morris. Haggett! I'm really curious to see who will come out of the door of that car. Scotland yard! Hello there, mr Osborne. Good morning. We'd like to talk to you. - We? I'm not the one who wants to speak to you. It's the chief-inspector, mr parr. I'll do what I can to be of help to you. But I'm terribly pressed for time. We are too, mr Osborne. And we shall be as brief as we can. Scotland yard wants us to make a little excursion to the themse. I trust you haven't gone to all this trouble because of something I've done. No trouble at all, mr Osborne. It's because of the red circle. It's Osborne! Interesting. We make our tour in the warehouse with Osborne. You're coming... Along too? It's my last official act. Why sir? This day is my last day. You replace me tomorrow morning. Nobody told me anything. You start at midnight. Well, maybe I shouldn't go. I drive you out of your position. That's nice, Yale. Many thanks. Come along anyway. Haggett is going to the yard and will bring sir Archibald up to date. Have you reached somebody at the yard? It'll take a moment. The house is being surrounded. My compliments, chief inspector. You'll be interested that we are in the secret love nest of the dead beardmore. Stop telling those horror stories... It's enough to give anyone the shivers, listening to what Dorothy told me. The man who kidnapped her was always saying: "If you're quiet nobody will hurt you. Don't make a sound or you'll be..." Certainly he didn't intend to harm her. He only wants to keep the child quiet. We will able to hear all about that. Little Dorothy is here. She's listening at this very moment. And she'll recognize the voice. She can identify the kidnapper for us. Wasn't the man masked? That's why I'm going to request that each of you say the phrase. Now, must I repeat the words? Oh, I can remember them: That nobody could understand anything. Come on, Osborne. Why don't you teach the young lover a little lesson? 1? Why should 1? Why not, Osborne? I won't. Nobody has the right to force me to do it! Come on, I say! No! No, I won't do it! Nobody leaving here before we've uncovered the truth! There's another way to sort this out! Inspector! Please don't let the little child come in here. I confess to the whole thing. What? Confess to precisely what? I kidnapped Dorothy... But I'm not the red circle. I took advantage of the general hysteria. And that's why I got to Mrs. Carlyle. And the murderer of lady doringham! Did you take advantage of that too? I'm innocent. I didn't do that! You are the murderer! Sir David west was murdered by one of your seamen, by the name Peter selly. And when you realized we were closing in you went crazy, Osborne. You robbed me 50.000 pounds. That was brilliant! I'm not responsible for any of this. Oh, you're responsible for a lot more. You happened to know that froyant finally picked up your trail, that he got to Toulouse to get evidence concerning your real identity. Then you poisoned froyant before he got back to London with the information. But that murder was where you made a mistake. You incriminated yourself. With the help of froyants documents. What documents? I guess I must have forgotten to tell, that froyant took the precaution of sending all the evidence to beardmore. He felt that he might be attacked. And you have this letter? - Yes. I assure you it was a bit of trouble. But that's not the only thing that I forgot to tell you at the time. I must say that I'm proud of you. Where did you find out for example that froyant was poisoned in the train. Where? - Yes. I suppose that you must have told me, inspector. You don't know about Osborne, I mean the red circle, he can be convicted. Oh, interesting. What was that? Because of his name, Henry Lightman. Lightman has a birthmark. It's a red circle around the base of his neck. It's because of this he was given the nickname by his prison-mates. I'm not the one! I see. Therefore you know that Osborne is not the red circle. Oh, yes. And you organize this little presentation only for me. If I had my hands free I would applaud you. But instead I must ask you to get your hands up. Everybody! It looks as if you took me for a ride, inspector. However, inspector, I should be sorry if I had to shoot you. Is it alright if I smoke? Tell me something, inspector. How long have you known the truth? When Selby was murdered I suspected you. And I was certain when you pretended a robbery and chloroformed yourself. And you insisted that the thief get in the building somehow over the roof. Haggett was watching the window. But then I became suspicious. But I wasn't absolutely certain. Let me remove any doubt you may have. Give me the key. No one tries to move now. You don't worry, gentlemen. It's alright. He's completely covered. Good evening, sir. Henry Lightman! Forgive me if I don't drink another time! No! Yale didn't realize that we would to pump out his stomach. There was a doctor by accident... But why did you surround the whole thing with such mystery? I confess I couldn't resist surprising Yale with froyant's resurrection. You should have worked in the theatre. At least I would have gotten a little applause. Anyway it's all over now. It's about tea-time and I'm thirsty. Nobody can brew better than my daughter. I didn't know you had a daughter. Well, 1 do. Now, where is she? - One second. She will be here now. She say she wanted to do police-work. But maybe you can talk her out of it. 1? No, I don't think I'm quite the man for it. Ah, you still think of that girl Thalia. Yes. Is that so terrible? She's a terrible person. I mean my daughter. As about your Thalia, I think in a few minutes she'll be convicted again. This time she'll get lifelong. No, inspector. She doesn't deserve that. Pardon. I must go and help her. Do you know... Hello, Jack. You want to leave? Just when tea is coming. Now, let me introduce you. Jack beardmore, I'd like you to know my assistant and my daughter. Thalia drummond? - Thalia parr. But Jack, don't you want to talk out her the plans she has. There's nothing to worry about, inspector. I'm afraid, my wife won't have time. Your wife? I haven't been asked yet. = nor have I. I admit that I don't really have to be. At my last execution I was allowed to have a cigarette. Ah, the French people. I like your humor. Only I'm afraid, if not for the birthday-celebration of the execution I wouldn't be here. And I could have stayed in bed. I'm sorry, haggett. Please, don't let it worry you. I don't intend to make it a habit. Are you sure it's a good strong rope? If not, we've got others.
