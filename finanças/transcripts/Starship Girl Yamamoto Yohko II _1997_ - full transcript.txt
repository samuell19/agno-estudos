Starship Girl Yamamoto Yohko II Prepare for defeat, Yamamoto Yohko! Now that we have the same ship, victory will belong to me, Sylvie Dread! Cinderella of the Cherry Blossom Moonlight Cherry blossoms? Isn’t it the wrong season, Lawson? Yohko-kun, there are no seasons in space. Is that right? But how do you view cherry blossoms in space? Actually, there are a series of gas clouds called the Cherry Blossom Ring. Every year, Terra and Ness hold a party when the cherry blossoms bloom. It’s like a big social gathering. Such easygoing enemies. So are we invited to this prestigious party? Only high-ranking officers are usually invited. However, since you’ve represented the Terran team so well… they’ve allowed a special guest policy. Great! Isn’t that great? We will finally make our debut in high-society! What should I wear? I would highly recommend not to cos-play. They would start to doubt our fashion sense. What? If it’s a formal party, should I wear a Kimono? All right! I’ll wear my reserved vintage jeans! Um… To tell you the truth, not all of you were invited. What? Only one special guest can attend. Why is that?! We’re the pretty girl fleet and there are four of us! That’s true, but… I’m sure it would upset Ness if all of us showed up. Seeing as we’ve beaten them over and over so many times. Yes, that’s exactly why. We didn’t want to offend Ness, so we decided to only take one of you. I’m very sorry. Well, if that’s the case… … it can’t be helped, right? So… so… who is going? Madoka, why don’t you go? C-Can I?! Well, it seems like you want to go the most. And your looks have the most impact out of all of us… especially above the eyebrows. Excuse me! That’s right, Yohko-kun! It wouldn’t be a good idea to intimidate Ness that much. Lawson! What do you mean by that?! J-Just joking Madoka. To decide who’s going, I have prepared this. Well? You look lovely, big sister Rouge! I know! I have an excellent foundation… so I become even more radiant and beautiful when I dress up! But how come big sister Rouge gets to go every year?! It’s not fair! Lote-chan wants to go to the party at least once! I’m sorry, Lote. But you see, cute and stupid girls are prohibited in the party room. Oh, I see! Then Lote-chan will never get to go! Because everybody’s jealous that Lote-chan is so cute and so stupid. But sis… it seems like you’re dressing up a bit more than usual this year. Of course! With my nice body and cute charm, this year… I will capture Fuligar-sama’s heart! And then… and then… Fuligar-sama will ask me to dance! Oh, no! We shouldn’t, not here… Oh, no! A-Anyway! Lote! Lubrum! Erutron! Don’t slack off just because I’m not around! Yes! Yeah! We’ll do our best. Fuligar-sama! Fuligar-sama! We are about to arrive at the Cherry Blossom Ring. You should prepare. Is that so? I understand. Hmm… Just a bit… Excuse me, sir, is something wrong? I was just thinking we should be doing something more productive… than going to this party… since we’ve been beaten by Yamamoto Yohko and Terra so many times. Forgive me, sir, it’s due to our incompetence. You and the Red Snappers are working very hard. As Commander, everything is my responsibility. Sir… By the way, what is Sylvie up to? That impudent woman? She’s been very quiet. She’s shut herself up in the space station for the past few days. I see. Besides, there are only space-shuttles on the station… so she can’t do much harm. Still, I have some security guards watching her. I thought she might do something while I was away. Why?! Why?! Why?! I won’t accept this! Why do we have to be the security guards at the party?! It’s not such a big deal, Madoka-chan. It’s actually quite an honor. Security patrol for the party is usually assigned… to the best fleet teams of Terra and Ness each year. That’s right. Those who didn’t win the lottery shouldn’t complain. Yohko. Just what is that anyway? What’s in the big bag? For someone who didn’t want to go, you seem totally prepared. Well, if you gotta do something, enjoy it. That’s my policy. Hey, everyone, I can see it! Wh-What is that? Is that the..? Beautiful… Wow. The Cherry Blossom Ring. Its cherry trees have grown long over many years. The trees stand within the gas clouds. It’s a ring with a radius of 90 kilometers. There’s nothing else like it in the entire universe. Where the heck did Yohko-kun go? I don’t feel comfortable being the only one not dressed-up. What’s the matter? Well, I’m looking for Yohko-kun. Oh, yeah, where did she go? Admiral Rion, why did you ask me to come along? I’m just a low-level engineer. What are you talking about? Your TA series is the reason for our fleet’s series of victories. Our outstanding pilots brought us victory. It’s all due to Yohko-kun’s and the other girls’ skill. You have a point. The girls you brought from the past using the Chronos Plain you invented. Oh, I’m sorry, Lawson. I just really appreciate all your hard work. So please enjoy yourself tonight. S-Sure… Would you like to dance, Lawson? W-With me? Is there anyone else here? Come on. Oh! No! I can’t! I’ve never danced before. Wait! Wait a minute! Oh, Fuligar-sama? That’s strange… where did he go? Everyone is so busy socializing that they can’t appreciate the flowers. Even though it’s meaningless, you bloom so beautifully. Where did Lawson go? And I’m all dressed up, too. Oh, I’m sorry. Here goes… Are you Fuligar-sama, the Ness fleet commander? Yes, I am. Well, if you don’t mind, would you dance with me? I’m sorry, I don’t seem to remember you. Normally I would love to dance with you, however… You already have a partner? Well, no, that’s not the case. I’m not really in the mood to dance. And I don’t have any obligation or reason to dance with you. You’re right. I don’t have one either. But… But do we need to have a reason? The cherry blossoms have bloomed so beautifully and the moonlight’s so lovely. Isn’t that enough reason to dance? Oh, my beloved Fuligar-sama. Where did he go? Rouge is looking so hard for you… Wh-Who is that suspicious tramp?! Why is she dancing with my Fuligar-sama?! It can’t be! That girl is… I thought so… I know her… I know those eyes… Where… where have I met her? I didn’t know you could dance so well. What? Warriors are required to dance. Still haven’t recognized me? Gross! Gross! Gross! What is up with Yohko’s outfit?! This is not a masquerade ball! But Yohko-san looks beautiful. Yeah, she looks totally different. She’s changed her fashion, she’s even changed her personality. She’s dancing with the enemy commander! What kind of nerve does that cat-girl have?! Big sister Rouge must be very mad! I don’t know what’s gonna happen. What do you mean by that? Sister Rouge is madly in love with Fuligar-sama. Sister is so desperate to get a man, she may make it rain blood over there. Lote-chan is very excited! Oh, really? Sister, everyone, watch out! What?! Damn it! Keep your ship away from mine! You ran into mine! Huh?! You used me as a shield! Oh, no! Is everybody all right?! I guess so, but my thrusters got damaged. I can’t move. Mine too. Lote-chan can’t move! Who the hell did this to us?! Why? If they wanted to destroy us, they could’ve easily done that. Y-Yamamoto Yohko. Don’t say my name or the magic will disappear before midnight. Do you think you’ve become Cinderella? Didn’t you know? I’m a romantic. I’ve never met a destructive romantic. Well, there’s one right in front of you. But does your prince have to be me? That’s up to you to decide. Th-That’s… What’s Yohko’s ship doing out here? But the color isn’t the same as the TA-29. And the shape is slightly different. I’ve found you. I’ve found you. Yamamoto Yohko. That voice is…! What’s her name? Yohko! I was just joking, Sylbee-san. It’s Sylvie! Sylvie Dread! What do you think you’re doing, Sylvie?! Oh, Fuligar? You’re here too, I see. It’s obvious, isn’t it? I’m here to settle our final battle. To find out who is the superior pilot. There’s no reason to do this now! You’ve already joined Ness! Ness… Terra… What’s the difference? This is a matter of pride. Did you actually believe I would pledge my loyalty to you and Ness? You’re easily fooled! Just like a baby. No wonder you couldn’t beat Yamamoto Yohko even once. Fuligar disrupted our battle last time, but not this time! Now, fight me, Yamamoto Yohko! No! Yohko-kun! If you reject my challenge… you know what will happen to the people at this party, don’t you, Yohko? I know. Now I’ll show you… just whom you picked a fight with! Yohko-kun, be careful! Sylvie’s ship is the… TA-29 Alpha! Five days ago… somebody stole it from the fleet command space-dock. It’s the spare TA-29, isn’t it? You knew? I peeked at the file on Rion’s desk. And that means more work for me. How could you allow such a big thing to be stolen? You guys are too easygoing. I’m deeply ashamed. Well, dance one waltz with me and I’ll forgive you. Super Strike TA-29! Yamamoto Yohko! Get ready! Go! Now that we both have the same ship, only skill will decide the winner. And I’m the one who will win! Super Brave TA-29 Alpha! Sylvie Dread! Attack! Sylvie! What should we do? We can’t see the battle from here. We’ll transfer to the Estanatorehi. By the time you arrive, the battle would be over. We’ll use my ship. In case of an emergency, I had my ship standing by inside the gas cloud. It’s a few minutes away by shuttle. Then we’ll take you up on your offer. It’s started. Do you think Yohko-chan will be all right? There’s no need to worry. In TV shows, when an imposter shows up… the original always wins! Humph! What are you aiming at?! You can’t escape, Yohko! The TA-29 sure has a lot of firepower. But this is no time to be thinking about that. It’s time to finish you, Yohko. Main gun! Ever Black Cannon! Fire! What are you doing, Yohko?! She shouldn’t be struggling against that old woman! But Yohko-chan’s actions are kinda strange. You don’t think Yohko-san might be… She can’t be…! There’s no mistaking it. Yohko-kun is that kind of person. Now you understand? This is the difference in our skill! Now, go down quickly, Yohko! There’s no choice. I have to shoot, but… You’re naive, Yohko. Do you think you can hide from me? There! How could she… She counterattacked… with her own Ever Black! Yohko! Fire! Why? Why, Yohko? You still don’t understand, Sylvie! What do you mean? You don’t have a fully equipped ship. If you got hit with no teleporter on board… you would’ve died with your ship. What are you saying?! Yohko fought me, while trying not to destroy my ship?! Nobody can die. That’s the only good part of this war. If you want to fight, let’s do it without risking our lives. Let’s settle it at the arcade. I’d accept your challenge any time. I accept my defeat today, Yamamoto Yohko. But the whole reason for being a fighter pilot is to fight in battle. I hope we meet again, somewhere. And then, I’ll be the one to win. Sylvie Dread! Man, what a sore loser. I suppose she does have something special about her. Beautiful… Now… let’s be more like ourselves… and have a real party!
