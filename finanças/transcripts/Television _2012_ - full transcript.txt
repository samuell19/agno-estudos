Why don't you allow any images in your village? Why don't you let the people watch television? Should I speak now? Yes, uncle. People listen to me out of love. Television shows lifeless images which is forbidden in Islam. So we don’t allow any images in our village. I myself have never taken a photograph either. Only the local Hindus. Sorry to interrupt. There is nothing of the sort in Islam. Many religious leaders appear on television nowadays. In fact, your twin brother Mr. Rajjab himself hosts a television show. So why are you against it? Yes, speak Uncle. Yes, speak Uncle. Two sons were born in Adam's house too. One righteous and one wrong. Rajjab is derailed, which is why he lives in town. But aren’t you depriving people of democratic rights? The whole nation is enjoying technology. And, you make this village rot in darkness? So you are here to protect democratic rights? Many western countries have banned Islamic veils. Doesn’t that harm Muslims’ rights? Why don’t you interview those presidents? That is the job of the journalists of those countries. We investigate irregularities in our society. We don’t say America or Europe is always right. But do their actions give you a license to do wrong? Who are you to ban television? Is this village run by the laws of the Bangladesh Government? Jabbar, this lady is too annoying. Better not to answer. Better not reply. No more interview today. Amen. One last question. Why have you banned contraceptives in the village? Life and death are acts of Allah. Why would human being control them? Mithanupur is a water-logged, strange country within a country. Because of Chairman Amin's doggedness, the people of this village are living far behind present times. The people standing behind me have just one question: when will they be set free? You are not allowed to watch television. What do you say about this? We are very happy! We want all of Bangladesh to be free of television made by Jews. Ok. Thank you. We are done with interviews. Let’s go, Anis. Don’t mind, please. Are you a lady or a man? Why are you wearing pants? Are you done talking? Yes, but did you mind? Father, when will you come back? Coming back from Malaysia is not easy. Talk to you later. Bye. Bye. Mother, Let me take a passport-sized picture. Brother, I want to take a picture. Ok. Go inside. Mother, keep an eye on the bag. Sit. My heart is racing. Why are you so naughty? There is no scope for being naughty in his presence? You won’t get a chance even in his absence! I want to hear you talk. Say something. I want to listen to you all day long. Then convince your father. What has my father done? Why doesn’t he allow young people to use mobile phones? To save them from being spoiled. But old people can use mobile phones. Don’t talk rubbish about my father! When did I talk rubbish? You have scolded me— I’m going to cry! Kohinoor. Yes? Aren’t you done? All right, it’s done! Please give me the photos soon. Kohinoor. What? I have something private to tell you. What is that? I am your boyfriend's employee, but... ok, forget it! What is it? Mother, I want to go to town and start my own business. Where? Town? What is wrong with his business here? Doesn’t he do business here? Or does he steal? I look after dad’s business here. But I want to stand on my own feet, to make my dad proud. So kind of him! He needs to go to town to make me proud. I will feel proud of him if he takes care of things here, instead of dreaming of moving to town! People are moving to town to become successful, to become exemplary. What are we doing here, then? Are we all cows and goats in this village? Ask him to get out of my sight. OK, as father doesn’t want it, I won’t go to town. In that case, mother, I want to buy a cell phone for myself. There he goes, following that old saying! Always ask for cannon if you actually want a pistol. Going to town is just the bargaining cannon. He just wants the cell phone. No young people can use cell phones in my village. Please let him. Do you keep track of what is going on around the country? Do you read newspapers? Young boys and girls in towns are getting spoiled by talking all night long. And there’s a new book: Facebook! Students have stopped reading textbooks. They are all now reading this Facebook. There have been reports. Do you want all this to happen in our village? I have a business to run here. Why will I talk all night? I need a cell phone for business purposes. Don’t I have a landline phone in my shop? Run your business with that. All right, Mother. I don’t need a cell phone. Do you know what’s wrong with senior people? They think that the young ones are always on the wrong path. So they make rules to keep them on the right path. As if they have been on the right track their whole lives. I think we should instead try to keep them on the right track. Old fools! Hey, stop the bike! Why, brother? Do you want to drive? Take off the helmet. But you don’t have a driving license, yet! I’m getting one. Son of a bitch. You insult my father again, and I will pull apart your tongue. Bring the helmet. Go. Why are you giving the key? Do I know whether the bike will fall in the river, if I drive in this mood? Only God knows! Are you trying to blackmail me? Turning this into blackmail? Fine, I’ll drive. God protect us. I am a poor assistant. Hey, what are you doing? Start it with the key. Have you taken your breakfast? That’s a nice shirt, by the way. No need to show sympathy now! Why don’t you understand? He is my father. Forget it. You never considered me close. Anyway, I will show you a way that we can buy a cell phone. How? Just wait and see. Tell me now. Just wait! Go and have a grand breakfast. I will give you 50 taka for it later. Give me your cell phone. At 8:05 tonight, call this number. An elder will answer the phone. Just ask for my boss. Tell the elder that you have to talk business with him. Talk to him for just five minutes. The call will cost only 5 Taka. Here is 20. Keep the remaining 15 for yourself. All of you have to do the same thing, one after another. What will we talk about? Anything. Gossip, song, rhymes. Who is speaking? I would like to talk to Solaiman. Solaiman. Call for you. Hello. Brother. A... B... Right, right. -C... D... The price has increased. 18,000 Taka now. E... F... E... F... E... F... Why are you saying same thing over and over again? Brother, what comes after F? E... F... E... F... E... F... G... H... I... J... K... That’s right, brother. Ok, come to my shop tomorrow. I will talk to you then. Who is this? -May I speak to Solaiman? There is no Solaiman here! -Solaiman, answer the phone, it must be for you. Hello -Brother, I will sing you a song. “I am a beggar for your love; give me your love, oooo...” Ok, Ok! Done. Please hang up now. Get yourself a cell phone tomorrow. How can I go against my father? Your father asked you to buy one. But it is him who forbids me to buy one. Just go and buy one because I asked you to. -Hello, Jabbar. From today, young people can have cell phones. -But no camera phones. -And it is not for girls. Boss asked you to keep this cell phone hidden. Ok. Ok. I'm going now! Ok, leave. What’s wrong? Why aren’t you going? I’m going. But don’t you want to hear what I wanted to tell you that day? Speak up. Wash your hands. Go. Yes, speak. How would it look if I told you I love you? What? I have loved you since childhood, but I never dared to express it. How could I? You are educated, and I’m illiterate. I have no money while your father earns dollars in Malaysia. But I love you. I don’t want anything in return. I just wanted to let you know. Please don’t tell this to the Boss. I’ll lose my job. Will you tell him? I beg you not to. Go away! Get out of here! Can you please give me a job on boat number 8? Sorry, I have not heard you correctly. Can you please give me a job on boat number 8? I’ll take you later. Boss is looking for you. Did he say anything about me? No. Why? Did you do fuck up? One tight slap, bastard. Where have you been? Why aren’t you talking? What have I done? -Did you collect the bills? Oh, I’m asking everyone. But no money yet. -Are you listening, brother? -Yes -You can go home now. -I will send money in the evening. Is that OK? Make sure that happens. Otherwise, Uncle will be mad at me. -Kohinoor What? -Boss has sent a mobile card for you. Ok. Give it to me, then. Jhorna. Why Jhorna? I want to have some betel nut. Can you bring some? Can’t you see that she is studying? What’s wrong, then? I actually came here to thank you. For what? Because you understood the ‘private’ nature of our relationship, and you didn’t say anything to the boss. Listen, if you speak this kind of rubbish again, I wlll surely tell your boss. To hell with your thanks! Ok. I take back my thanks. Instead, I give you a curse. Should I call him and tell him what you have just told me? You get mad if I say ‘I love you’. Now, I say ‘I hate you’, and you are still angry. You should go on your way. Give me my top-up card back. -Why? Boss didn’t buy the card for you. I couldn’t find an excuse to talk to you, So I bought this card. I am a poor man. Give it back. I’m not going to return the card. This is your punishment for speaking such rubbish. If someone is happy to rob a poor chap, so be it. Take your card. I might be poor, but I have a big heart! Keep the line active, and leave the phone somewhere inside the house. I will keep listening to everything you do. Walking, talking, laying on the bed. The sounds will help me imagine your surroundings. Like watching you live on television. Your father doesn’t let anyone watch television. And you are busy watching a woman’s personal life through ‘mind television’. -Man, why do you need so much hassle? -Learn how to use a computer, and buy a small laptop. -I will buy one, too. -Internet mobile is so cheap these days. We can buy some data and start video-chatting online. 24 hours online. Don’t you know I skype with my father every week? I know. But I thought it is complicated and damn expensive. Okay, I will join an evening computer course from tomorrow. I will make this video chat happen soon. Now please keep the phone in a corner, and let me hear and imagine. Ok. -I’ll go first. -Am I not older than you? -Is the exam schedule out? -Yes mother. it’s out. -When does it start? -The fifteenth of next month. -Change your cloths. -Hey, Kohinoor, where are you? Coming, mother. Just one problem. Your father hates cell phones. Why would he allow a computer? My father has no idea about computers. He thinks they are a kind of typewriter. Even I thought of them as a modern type-writer. It won’t be a problem if you bring in a computer to the village. Better we keep it hidden. Ok. You can go now, let me sink in your atmosphere. Boss. What's happened? Why are you shouting? Ok… no... it’s all right. I thought I messed up a calculation. How many? 113. How many? 113. What are you looking at? What have I done? I can’t do all this. You learn on my behalf. Can’t do it himself... Now me... When you chat with Boss, open it like this. Close the window so that no one will notice. And when you are done talking, close it like this. You don’t have to worry. I’ll put a curtain around. Oh, then it’s solved! I’ll leave now. Sister, can we watch television on this? Be quiet! Make sure no one gets to know about this. A call for you. Who is it? Solaiman. Hold it to my ear. Hello. -What is it? Father, if you permit, I want to stay at the shop tonight. Why? -Tonight, there will be a good catch of fish in the river. -If I don’t stay here, the fishermen might lie. If they lie, Allah will punish them. Ok, if you think you should stay, then you can stay. What? Why are you so happy today? -You know how I feel? It seems like we are on the same bed. I’m on the left and you are on the right side. i’m on the right and you are on the left. Believe me; I am enjoying this game so much. A Computer! What a gift of God! Mr. Happy, I was rushing to finish my domestic duties to come online, and I ended up burning my hand. -Seriously? Where did you burn it? -Let me see your hand. Here. Where are you, Aslam’s father? Where are you? -Hey, Mojnu. -Hey Mojnu, -Wake up, wake up! What the hell is going on? Am I not a human? Am I not supposed to sleep? Hey, don’t shout! I will kill you. Got disconnected. Connect me. Can't connect himself. Me, the connector. Fix it. Hurry! I don’t see anything! Please be quiet! Fix it fast! Here you go. What have you brought, Kumar Babu? A television. What? A television. Don`t you know that television is a sinful box? Our religion doesn’t prohibit this. Oh, right, it is allowed in Hindu religion. Jabbar, take the television to the school grounds. I will go to mosque and think about whether television should be allowed in this village or not. Should I come, Mr. Chairman? No, I don’t need you guys. Hey, where have you been? -Been to Sudharamgonj. There is breaking news. What? Kumar sir has brought a television set to the village. Is that so? -Yeah! -Where is it now? In the school field. -Where are you headed? Sudharamgonj. On a date? No. My boyfriend has gone to town. -Oh, I see. Hey, by the way, can’t you ask your boyfriend to shave his thorns? -What does that mean? His moustache! I can’t stand boys with moustache. Really? But you know what they say. "No pain, no pleasure"? You naughty! Let's go. Kohinoor. Dear Imam, why am I being tested this way? Allah, please show me the right path! These Jews from the west! They invent these sinful devices and manage to trap everyone! Muslims all over the world have fallen into their trap! Religious leaders like my brother host television shows! May God punish them! If I throw the television into the river, then non-believer’s right to practice his own religion will be hampered. On the other hand, if I let the television remain in the village, our religious beliefs will be hampered. What should I do? Sir, please don’t think I am supporting the television. But I have not found anything in the Quran or Hadith that suggests watching television is forbidden. You think you know everything? Was television discovered when the Quran was bestowed upon humanity? No. Do you agree that lifeless images are forbidden? Yes, I do. Do the image shown on television have life? No. Then what do they become? Haraam or halaal? In that case, you can tell Kumar Babu to keep the television in his house. Only Hindus will be allowed to watch it. No Muslims can watch. If he allows any Muslim to watch it, he, along with the Muslim, will be punished, and the television will be thrown into the river. All right, Kumar Babu. Not a single Muslim should watch your television. And if you fail to ensure this, then God knows what punishment will befall you. Be careful. Take it inside. Sir, please turn the television in our direction. Please, sir. Haven’t you heard the Chairman? I can’t let anyone watch television But we are Hindus! We can watch. -Sir, please turn the television in this direction. We can’t see anything from this this angle. Jahangir, haven’t you heard the Chairman? I have to ensure that no Muslims watch the television. Sir, the Chairman will never know. Hey, you people, are you going to tell him? No, no! Sir, no one will tell! And who keeps track of things that happen at night, anyway? Can you see? -To your left. No, no, a little right. Is this Ok? -Yes, now it’s fine. Father, Elias Sir doesn’t know how to teach math. I will definitely fail if I continue my math tuition with Elias Sir. Amjad got extraordinary marks in math last year. Why did Amjad do so well? Because he took private tuition from Kumar Sir. Likewise, I need to take private tuitions from Kumar Sir . All the kids go to him. Three zeros after one is one thousand. Three zeros after one is one thousand. Four zeros after one is ten thousand. Four zeros after one is ten thousand. Five zeros after one is one lac. Five zeros after one is one lac. Six zeros after one is ten lacs. Six zeros after one is ten lacs. Seven zeros after one is one crore. Seven zeros after one is one crore. Kohinoor, it's Mojnu. Where did you go? To Kumar Sir`s place. Are you going to ask anything else? I will not stand in your way anymore. -If you want me to do anything, -you simply have to tell the Boss. He will convey your messages to me. Is there any point in showing my face to you anymore? You are never going to show me your face? Why are you still standing here, then? Gosh, why are you so dramatic? Hey, Mojnu. come here. Take Kohinoor to her home. OK, Boss. It won’t be right for her to go alone. And while returning, please meet Kumar Babu. -Why? He has committed a crime by bringing a television into the village. People roam around his house to watch it. -What will happen to him if my father finds out? So, if he wants to be safe, he should invite Kohinoor into his house to watch television. OK. Now go. Let’s go, sister. Sorry, sir. I have forgotten what I am supposed to tell you. I have remembered... you have committed a crime by bringing a television to the village. People roam around your house and watch television. What will happen to you if Chairman Uncle comes to know? So, if you want to be safe, you should let Kohinoor into your house to watch television. Got it? I do not let any Muslim watch television! Hey, why do you talk so much? Just remember what I said. Are you all well? -How can we be well? Allow us to either buy a television or drink poison. What do you mean? I cannot understand you. We cannot survive without buying a television. You cannot live without television? Then, go and die. Better you die. Wait! You people talk rubbish! Don’t take offense, Uncle. As you know, they are primary school teachers, and you know that they have meager earnings. Even you help them sometimes. They do tuition outside school hours to earn a little extra. But ever since Kumar Babu brought that television, all students-Hindus and Muslims- go to his place to study. They watch television while studying. I need proof. Can you prove it to me? Sir, you want proof? Come with us right now. Let’s go… Open the door, Kumar Babu. Wait there. Do you let them watch television? No. I never let them watch television. Do you watch television while studying? Hey, you wait. Aren’t you Ruhul Amin’s daughter? Haven’t your parents taught you any manners? An elderly is asking you to stay. Do you watch television or not? Speak the truth and get 500 taka as a reward. Uncle, I will. Yes, speak. We don't watch TV. They sit in that corner so they can watch television in the mirror. They beat us if we want to sit there, and say “You don’t need to watch television. You can only listen.” So, they watch movies and we listen movies! Hmm...Jabbar, give him 500 taka. All right. Kumar Babu, how much did your TV cost? 8,000 taka. Hey, Jabbar. -Yes, Uncle? You will give him 9,000 taka later. Yes, Uncle. Take his television, and come with me. From today, there will be no television in this village. come here. Why are you here? To watch television? Why don’t you answer? See, Jabbar, what an insolent girl! Hey, reply to his questions! Go to the yard. And hold your ears, and do 3 sit-ups. It will be a lesson for anyone who is thinking of being disobedient. Come with me! Do the sit-ups here! Why aren’t you doing? One, two, three. Why aren’t you stopping? I asked you to do it three times. What happened? See, Jabbar, what an insolent girl! Stop. Ok, let me talk to her parents. Let’s go. Don’t try to contact me from today. I don’t have any relations with you. Why are you so upset? If you can’t live your life without him, why not sort out the issue and continue the relationship? Mom, I want to, but my anger is not allowing me. Then forget him. Mom, how can I? I love him so much. Stop crying. It's time for Magrib prayers. This bloody television is killing me! Don’t speak like a woman. You are the Chairman’s son. You should sit up straight. Girls will come and go like tides. There will be more Kohinoors. What are you saying? Has she left me forever? She is only a little upset with me! Why will she leave you? You will leave her. I discovered that it’s only for watching television. Uncle Sattar will elaborate. I worked so hard to discover that the reason young people are going across the river is to watch television. And you just said that you found it out? What a cheat. Cheat? -Oh, shut up! Don’t fight for credit now! Do one thing, Jabbar. Set up vigilance in riverside market. Look for the kids from our village. Catch them red-handed, and punish them. But there is something I do not understand. People used to go to the riverside market before. But they were never seen crazy to watch tv before. Now what happened to them? -Youth of the village! -You don’t have to risk taking the drubbing for watching cinema in Sudharam’s television stalls. -Come to Javed Theater to watch cinema for free. -Just bring your coconuts, and get tickets in exchange. -Hurry, hurry, hurry! You advertise this evil stuff? Get lost. We want tickets. Next show please! Who will go to hell if you go to the cinema or watch television? Me or you? Don’t I want the betterment of the village? Who saved you from the clutches of NGO’s micro-credit? Who gave you loans with no interest? I have lost connection with the villagers-- do as you wish. Jabbar, get them out my sight. Uncle, we have made a mistake. Please forgive us. We were good in the past. We have become addicted to movies on Kumar Babu’s television. We will no longer watch television or go to the cinema. Hey, will any of you watch it again? No, no. we will not watch it anymore. Please forgive us. Please don’t curse us. OK. This is your last chance. Jabbar, tell them to go now. Go. All of you. It is a shame that my people got caught at a movie theater! Uncle, I have an idea. What idea? Introduce a visa system in the village. What is that? Jabbar, are you stealing my credit yet again? Uncle, this idea came to me first. Let’s introduce guards on our village jetty. If anyone wishes to cross the river, the person needs to get a visa. This system won’t work. We need to find way to entertain the villagers. What kind of entertainment? Should I okay cinema- television now? -If you permit me, I can make a Halal television for them. How can a television be Halal? -Permit me to make it. Once I am done, you can see it for yourself. If you think it’s Halal, then we will continue it. OK. if you can make it Halal, go ahead. You taste it first. Then tell me how it tastes. Brother, there is nothing to be afraid of. Initially tastes bitter, but eventually becomes normal. Mojnu, I’m good for nothing. I am so pathetic that I can’t even drink alcohol. How would I drink poison if i had to, then? -Take it, Mojnu. Drink on my behalf. Drink for my sorrows. Let me drink water. Her memory turns everything into alcohol. No matter whether it’s water or milk. Boss, I have almost finished the bottle drinking for your sorrows. Only a little is left. Can I drink it for my own sorrows? What is your sorrow? Doesn’t everyone have some? So many secret sorrows! You have been with me for so long, and yet I don’t know your sorrows. Tell me. Do you know whom I love, boss? Who? I will tell you everything today! I will confess everything! Want one? I love one of my cousins. We used to play together in our childhood. You won’t believe it— she looked exactly like your Kohinoor. And, oh God, her name was also Kohinoor. Idiot, -not you the guy who has an affair with Kohinoor If I could catch him, I would beat him. Boss, I have drunk for your sorrows of your Kohinoor, now can I drink for my Kohinoor? Drink! O Kohinoor! O Kohinoor! I love you. No son of a devil can take you away from me! Kohinoor! Why are you here at this late hour? Do you study even on Eid day? Good student. Now, take this mobile phone. Settle the issue with Rahman Bhai. Which Rahman Bhai? Oh, Rahman, Solaiman, X, Y, Z. They are all the same to me now. Please settle all differences with Boss Solaiman. -He has started drinking for you. Drinking what? Alcohol! He is burning his heart by drinking Alcohol. -He will die for you. Tell him to marry alcohol. Let him die drinking alcohol. Fine. -Listen, if he wants to marry me, he will have to do what I say. Fine. -Hey, did I tell you what he needs to do? Why are you leaving without listening? Ok. Tell me. -If he wants to marry me, he will have to stand against his father. He will have to buy a television and come straight to my house. Together, we will watch it. The entire village will watch. Then, I will marry him. Fine. Will you tell him exactly what I told you? Or will you twist it? You do not love me. No problem. But I can not accept that you do not trust me. I am still on my feet only because I am drunk today. Otherwise, I would have fallen flat. Please fall. What? I love you, I love you, I love you. I have a private television. I can see you live on that imaginary television. And in that television, I do lot of censored thing with you. Resist me if you can. I don’t love you. I don’t love you. I don't love you. There, I resisted you Ok. Fine Drunk. Can’t you slap him? Impossible! Will I point gun at my father? How can you? I will leave Kohinoor from now. I have no relation with her anymore. I am relieved. What else did she say? She talked a lot of rubbish about you. And now you have just left her. Why show interest about what she said? You are right. I have no interest. So should I find a bride for you then? Aunty was telling me the other day to find one. Dear villagers. Today, I would like to make an announcement. I have decided to embark on the Hajj this year. I should have gone long ago. But as you know, I did not go because I am scared to ride in an airplane. I realize now that was the devil’s influence. I will liberate myself from the devil’s clutches and make the journey. Many blessings for my villagers. -No one will get a visa unless it is urgent. What`s your purpose? I wish to see my relatives. Your visa refused. Why, Uncle? -Next, please. -My aunty has been in an accident. -Tell me the truth. Uncle, I have a feeling that he is lying. Tell the truth. If you are indeed lying, you won’t be able to stop me from speaking ill of you. You have run this system for a long time. Change this system now. Please make your uncle understand... Uncle, please... Who the hell is he to make me understand? You talk to me. Can you I talk to you later? Uncle, I will arrange your passport. Don’t worry. Talk to the Hajj agent. Check whether anyone can go to perform Hajj without a passport. Uncle, I don’t think you will be able to go without a passport. Take a picture. What’s the big deal? Uncle hasn’t eaten anything. Can you please ask him to have something? Chairman Saheb. It's afternoon. Won`t you take lunch? Did uncle eat anything? Nope. How can you do this, Uncle? Aunty told me you are not eating anything. She also said you are not sleeping well. If something happens to you, where will we go? What is the deadline for Hajj visa applications? The time is already up. But they said if we submit the passport in a week, they can send you. I have an idea to make a passport without taking the picture. What is your idea? What’s up? Came to meet you. Then why are you standing outside? Hey, why have you not taken him inside yet? I did go in. Also had tea. Just came out to enjoy the wind. Come, come. Your proposal is very good. My twin brother wants to go on a pilgrimage. So he wants to use my photo in his passport. I go to hell, he goes to heaven. Tell him to take his own photo if he wants to go to heaven. He needs a passport-sized photo. Go inside, please. Make sure nobody knows that I took photo. Please raise your head a little. Open your eyes. Look this way. Smile a bit. Open your eyes, please. Keep your eyes, open. Smile, please. Jabbar, Is that Sattar playing King Akbar’s character? Yes. This will not do. Why, Uncle? He is pretending to be Akbar. He is lying. And the villagers are believing this lie. Both are committing sin here. Islam does not allow lying. That's why novel, cinema-all are bad. This is a little imagination, uncle. No imagination is allowed. Imagination is bad. Young people tend to fantasize things riding on the horse of imagination. Tell everyone that the Halal TV show is canceled. Go and stop it. Stop everything. -I have forgotten you, kohinoor! And I am happy to forget! Good job. You should not keep her in your mind. May Allah bless you. Believe me. I believe you. I have forgotten her. Talking like a man! -But how can I forget her? Dear villagers! Dear villagers! Next Friday, Ms. Kohinoor, daughter of Ruhul Amin Uncle of this village, will get married to Solaiman Patowary, the only son of Amin Patowary, which means me. All of you are welcome to the ceremony. Come and have beef and mutton for lunch. Next Friday, Ms. Kohinoor, daughter of Ruhul Amin Uncle of this village, will get married to Solaiman Patowary, the only son of Amin Patowary, which means me. Come and have beef and mutton for lunch. On the same day, a television will enter this village. I and Kohinoor Begum will watch television in Kohinoor's house. You are also welcome to watch. Hey, stand here. From now, a revolution has started. This village will not run by anybody’s whim. Young people will also have their say. We will go to college. We will be modern. We will be pious. Where are they? On the fisheries bridge. Please have as much as you want. Hey, give some to him. Mojnu, aren’t you eating? Hey, insolent boy! Leave the mic, and come down right now. -Hey, Mr. Amin Chairman. -I revolt against you today. Go and catch them. I will crack your head open right now. Bury that Jabbar into the ground. The youth has revolted today. No one can suppress the youth any longer. Give Jabbar's bag back. Hey, give it back. Just give the order, Chairman Saheb. We will level the young men to the ground. -Jomila Begum. When the boy was young, -you once suffered from typhoid. -I used to stay awake all night. -If the boy urinated, I changed his clothes. Today, the same boy wants to beat me. I should die. -Don't cry, please. -Don’t cry anymore. -Please don’t curse him anymore. -If you want to curse someone, curse me. Allah, please don’t punish my son. Please forgive me if I have committed any sin. Had I not been a sinner, would I have been so humiliated by my own son? I have forgiven him. Please forgive him, oh Allah. Allah, please don’t punish my son. -I have killed my father. Go and sorry to your father. Rivals are shaking hands. So what happens to my injury and insult? Forget your insult. It happened in chaos. Now pray so that they are united again. Uncle, I should have punched on your face. And see how you still say these sweet words? But I am not insolent. I can't do this. I have forgiven you. I do not hold any grudge. Listen Solaiman’s mother, go to Kohinoor's house, and finalize their marriage. It is almost time for me to go to perform Hajj. I will arrange the ceremony when I back- Only if Allah allows me to get back safely. What's up? I have to come to thank you. Thanks for marrying somebody else. Great news! Another great news is awaiting for you. I am leaving this village. That doesn’t mean that I am setting you free. I will continue the conjugal life with you forever. How? I told you before- I have an imaginary television. I can imagine you by turning that tv on. I can do whatever I wish to- make love, fight, or pat. I will be having my conjugal life there. Every morning I will ask for three cups of tea. You will ask- why three cups? I will reply- one for you, one for me, and one for our daughter Fullie. I am no more a servant. I am a free man now. I can tell freely- I love you Kohinoor. Good bye. Hey Mojnu, hold this and play. Where are you going? Come here Nowhere. Okay, fine! I was looking for you. Go to Riverside market. Buy 5kg rice, 5kg meat, 2kg sugar, 4kg vermicelli. Plain vermicelli or modern one? Both. And 4 kg butter. Paijam or Kalijira rice? Whatever is the best! You know this is for Kohinoor's family. It has to best. Oh yeah! Of course. Hey, do I know? They came here to talk about marriage. But they made it official. Hey, hold for a moment. Aunty... What did you bring here? Solaiman sent all these. Can you please check if the butter is alright or not? If it is bad, I will kill the shopkeeper. Go get married. Then your father-in-law can also send these. Anyway, there will be a ceremony once my father-in-law is back from Hajj. Hold on a second. Aunty, please check if the butter is okay or not. If it is bad, I will kill the shopkeeper. How many times do you have to say this? Jabbar and Solaiman could have gone with you to town. What's the use? I will go to my grave alone, anyway. How have you been? Am good Am leaving for Hajj. Please pray for me. Jabbar, go to office everyday. Now leave. Father, please do pray for us. Please forgive me father. I have made mistakes. Do take care of yourself.

Can you please take my bags? Both of them. How much did you give them? I have given 3 lacs taka to Shukur Ali to perform Hajj. How many of you are here? 20 to 25 of us. 15 to 20 of us are together. We demand the government sends us for Hajj now. When was the last time you spoke to Shukur Ali? We spoke yesterday. He told us he will get us the flight. When we came here, we found the doors locked. What can we do now? We demand the government send us for Hajj now. How did you manage so much money? My son lives abroad. He sent me 3 lacs taka for Hajj. I gave it to Shukur Ali. And now, Shukur Ali has cheated me. So what will you do now? What can we do? Now, we cry to Allah. I see no other options or hope. What will I tell my son? You all live in town. I came from my village to go for Hajj. But I cannot go now. I never harmed anyone my entire life. I always helped People. If I cannot go to Hajj, people will think Allah has not accepted me. How will I show my face to my people then? I will give you any amount. please help me go for Hajj. You are like my father. I feel for you. But I can do nothing. Hotel BALAGONJ. Dhaka. Uncle. Your dinner Leave the food here, and close the door. Why didn't you have your dinner? I wasn’t hungry. Then I am taking dinner back and leaving the hot lunch. Uncle, if you don’t eat, we will be in trouble. We don’t want a murder case here. Hey, you there, Can you please turn on the television? I wish to see the Hajj. Oh God, I am present.
