Who knows him? - Come here. Variety lights, shining like stars With the charm of love You'll give her your heart And she won't bring it back! Variety lights Smiles and uncanny dances A frenzy of kisses Designed to make you dream This is happiness! Variety lights Smiles and uncanny dances A frenzy of kisses Designed to make you dream This is happiness! Happiness! Variety lights, shining like stars With the charm of love You'll give her your heart And she won't bring it back! Variety lights Smiles and uncanny dances A frenzy of kisses Designed to make you dream This is happiness! Happiness! I had to give another encore, the audience loved me. - You are so fanatical. - The audience must be satisfied. But how can you give my company's pay to a stranger? We have a company administrator who knows the rules! I'm a stranger? You've never seen this face before? - What happened? - The money was confiscated. Confiscated? - Young man, you can't take my pay. - Mine either. Sir, debts must be paid, my friend here fed you for two years, and after two years, he hasn't received his money yet. - It's a postal delay. - Postal delay? Here's the change. One moment, young man. I must be paid, I'm a national star. And I sweat blood up here and don't get a penny. Pardon me, but this is disgusting. How will we continue the tour now, dear sir? - Why should I care? - You should care. - There's nothing we can do. - You must be reasonable. I'm canceling my contract. Who cares about the others? I'm a star and I want my pay. You want your pay? Here. Get your hands off me, I went on even with a high temperature. - Yes, we have a fever. - What do you want from me? It's a debt we all contributed to. We all ate, all of us. - You most of all. The money? - Me? - I don't remember. - You don't? - I want my pay. - Wretch. Wretch? Cuckold. Cut it out! Let me explain, sir. Don't go away, just one word. - Excuse me, where is the impresario? - What impresario? We'll have to withdraw from our savings. No need for that. Take this. - What is it? - An aspirin for your fever. - Do I have one? - A little. The dog is hungry. - Don't throw yourself on me. - Who's touching you? Send your regards. Add my regards too, and say we don't have a penny. - When will you come back? - How should I know? The train is arriving, come on. Maestro, maestro, the train. Alfredo. Listen, this is Righetto's bicycle. - Can you return it tomorrow? - Fine. - Thank you,bye. - Bye. Come on! Damn that dog. Come on, hurry up. Papa, over here! I only have ten tickets. You and the maestro have to stay in the toilet. - Really? - Damn. Why do I always have to do it? Can't you go for once? Give me a hand. Farewell! Don't forget to write! You're the boss, right? Look. If you want me, I'll stay with you. This is my diploma. I danced for 70 hours. I had to stop because the others did, but I wasn't tired at all. I even won a prize for interpretive dance. With one of those slightly Indian dances, you know. That's me in a bathing suit. I was elected Queen of the Beach. You can't really tell in the pictures, but look. They wrote in the newspaper that I have legs like Maresca's. Go to the compartment next door, I'll join you soon. Let's stay here. We can talk easier. They did well in awarding you the prize. You have the most beautiful legs, very artistic! And I know what I'm talking about. I'm a talent scout. Showbiz is hard, but I never gave up. You shouldn't do that. All I want is to get into show business. It's always been my passion, since childhood. If you don't want to help me, fine. I'll manage on my own, as usual. I don't know how to say it but once I saw you on stage, I felt I could trust you. I thought you would understand me, that you could at least help me to get started. I'm a fool, I was so wrong. My dear, theater is a very serious thing. - The ticket collector will find us here! - Spazia and I want to breathe. If you'd rather die... - Hey, Remo, come here. - What is it? He wants money for the ride into town. The theater owner said nothing to him. Hey, impresario, make sure we get what's in our contract. Good man, didn't the theater owner hire you to take my company? No. - Will he take us? - No. What a mess. Doesn't matter. He'll tell you when we get there. - Get on board! - No, I need the money. Don't you have any? - Do you? - Of course not! Well, I know a shortcut, in a half hour we'll be there. It's three miles. You'll dance the boogie-woogie in my place tonight. - This fatso's a real pain in the neck! - This won't end here, you damn hack. Are you moving? Hey, look how pretty they are. That's my savings account, too. It's in both names, these are our savings. You better change the subject before I lose my patience. How ungrateful. Our savings? 50 thousand... You only put in 200. The other 49,800 are mine. And if it had been the opposite? How much would you have put in? 200, you fool! Anyhow, we only touch it in ten years when we open the deli. - Me, a grocer? - That's right! That's it, Melina. Keep your eyes open. He's up to something. But what's this bastard come to? Look at these beautiful creatures! A hundred years of joy to you! Holy saints, holy saints. It seems like it was only yesterday I had my first communion. Yeah, just yesterday... "I love thee, holy ox: a soothing sense..." When will we get there? "All the divine green silence of the plain." Dante. Poor guy, what a tragic fate! Stop it with those hands! - I'll take off my shoes. - Me too. A carriage. Are you going to town? Get on then, it's here for you. Great! Miss, my company thanks you. Get on. Move it. You're very kind, thank you. May I? Melina Amour, performer. Valeria del Sole, performer. I'm here with my fiance. Move over there a bit. You sit next to me. Look who's here. Off we go! How pretty. I love being a dancer! Really? I even spoke with the director. - She wants to dance with us. - What? The director wants to make her a dancer. Has he lost his mind? What kind of ideas did you give that girl? Who? Salvatore! - Miss, I think there's a misunderstanding. - I think so too. I understand your passion for show business, but my company's administration can't take on more staff. - It shouldn't! - That's right. That's the last thing we need. No, no. Take her in? We're falling apart here. We can't split our pay into more parts! We already don't have enough for ourselves! But the director told me... - What director? - Mr. Dal Monte. I told her. The girl really does have artistic talent, and she should be hired. - Use your own money for flirting. - Excuse me, who are you? I'm a guy who's been on stage for no less than 30 years. - She wouldn't be the first I've launched. - Who exactly did you launch? Look, I don't want to get paid. I'll work for free. - And the food? - A place to sleep? And the train? But who is she anyway? What does she want? Who sent her here? Get out, babe. Come on, girls. Let's go, take this stuff. Why would you want to be a dancer? Stay home, while you still have one. I wish I could. Right, get yourself a ticket back home, and go. How will I pay for the ticket? I don't have a penny left. Salvatore! My dear commendatore! The theater manager is here. - Good morning, commendatore. - What a pleasure! My dear commendatore, you always look so young. Long time, no see. But you were always in my mind. Where is the company? Oh, Lord, here it is. Good morning! But I hired you for fifteen acts. Administrator! Administrator of the company, the theater manager. A pleasure. - This is the program you sent me. - Fine. - An international variety artist. - That's Checco. - Melina Amour. - Right there. Valeria del Sole, a frenzied showgirl. - Here she is. - I'm the King of Song. "Francis and the Miss," the tango virtuosi. That's Checco and his lady. - Liv, the Fregoli imitator. - Checco's wife. The crowd-pleaser. That's Checco too. I've seen enough. You won't fool me again. The 12 dancers are seven. See you tonight at pay time. Sir! He counted me, too. Come on, guys. Let's rehearse. Oh, ungrateful heart You stole away my life It's all over and done And you think of me no more Stinking audience. And it's raining. Quickly! Come on! They're too tight. I already tried them on. - The microphone? - Can't you see they don't fit? Just take them off then! Why are you sending her on stage? Shut up, the theater manager included her in the show. And now everyone's in bikini on the island of song and love. "Sweet Molokai." Oh, sweet Molokai Let's go! Quick! I will never be able to forget you The pearl of the Hawaiian Islands Over there, in the delight Of that blue sky The sea whispers to you... - I don't know the steps. - Go. A song of passion A harmony of love for you That's where I'd gladly return And never leave you again You are the queen of my heart A paradise of happiness Hawaii - What happened? - She ended up in her underwear. What have you done, you fool? How do I know? My skirt was torn. You ugly fanatical copycat. This idiot wants to be in the show. - Get lost! I won't go out there anymore. - We'll discuss it tomorrow. But it's not my fault. You, it's your turn. Come on, hurry up. Now, "Mysterious India" presented by the scientist magician Edison Will. Get outta here! Ladies and gentlemen, before the civil and military authorities, I will now perform experiments inscrutable to scientific knowledge. Damn this! And now, gentlemen, Spazia the goose will sing for you "Beautiful Dreamer." What do these idiots want? It's my turn now, the show is saved. And now, everyone to Spain with Francis and the Miss. Start playing "El Muchacho." 30 years in show business and this has never happened to me. - Beat it. - I am Melina Amour. The Melina Amour. This is no way to treat us.

Well, if you'll allow me, I am Attorney Renzo La Rosa. This is Dr. Bruno Antonini, brilliant journalist. And Duke De Grasso. - Now we all know each other. - My pleasure. - The dancers of my company. - A beautiful company. No, not you. - Marvelous show. Where's the girl? - Over here. - There you are. So are we agreed then? - Where? What do you mean, "Where"? My place, at my den. - Alone? - If you want to bring someone. I'd love to, of course. Not you. I'll write an article in my paper. We'll be out of the theater in five minutes. Good evening. Just five minutes! - And who'll take me back home? - Good night. Right this way, everyone. Mademoiselle. - Where is the carriage? - I sent it home. A little stroll is good for your appetite. And the rain stopped. Checco, wait for me. What a beautiful moon! Guys, the train leaves at 7:35. Don't miss it. - I'm hungry. - And I'm incredibly thirsty. We'll be there in ten minutes. Slowly, slowly. You could slip here. This estate is so beautiful. One at a time For pity's sake Figaro? I'm here Figaro? I'm here Figaro here, Figaro there Figaro up, Figaro down Swift, swifter, like lightning I am I am the city's servant Ah, worthy Figaro! Worthy, superb Fortune will not fail you - It's The Barber of Se ville. - Rossini. I am the city's servant - Nice voice. - Not bad. Listen, listen to this passage. Please, I'm hungry. Forgive me, miss, but the theater was my vocation, if only I'd studied. - Is it still far? - No, a few more minutes. Be careful, don't be afraid. Watch out, Papa. Who is this guy? Where is he taking us? He's taking us to the North Pole. I'm going to get rid of him. - Put that down. - My shoes are worn out. Are you nuts? Keep walking. Cut it out! Here we are. We've arrived. We've finally arrived. You'll see now, you'll see the villa. Our lawyer is great. Come in, friends. Come in. Make yourselves at home, please. What a gorgeous property! It looks just like the Sforza Castle. What a trip. I haven't walked this much in ages. Shut up! We're in a place of abundance! There's chickens, pigs, good wine! Everything! Slowly... You can do it. Well done! Come down! Hey, Checco, there's plenty to drink here. Smile! - Well? - Very nice. This is good. I'll write an article. Do you know what women called me when I was young? "Sun-ll The Milanese women, however, used to call me "Dew Eyes." Love is a woman An embroidery made of gossip Gossip! Words that gratify Promises that are forgotten Lovely! A memento of this beautiful evening. What's going on? Dear friends, it's very late. Please forgive us, but we have to go. - What? - Why? - Who made you the ship's captain? - So what? It's 3:00 a.m. We have to go to Rome to get a hotel. Hotel? But Mr. Renzo invited us to sleep here. Here's to Mr. Renzo. How could we possibly sleep here? Yes, yes, there's room for everybody here. There are eight bedrooms, eight. There you go. And if you feel sleepy, you can take a nap on that nice sofa. Do you hear that lovely waltz? Excuse me, may I? Excuse me, may I? Please. What a long face. Angry with me? Why are you behaving like this? Have I done anything wrong? It has nothing to do with me. Are you worried about me? Well, then, you are free. You're not my daughter or - I judge you on stage. I can say that you don't dance well because you don't. That you can't sing because you can't. Maybe in a while, with hard work, I can set you up as I've done with many other girls. But then after that, you can do as you wish. I can't lay claim to you. Right? Well, I'm going over next door. Aren't you sleeping here? No, I'd rather go over there. Good night. - What happened? - Where? Why are you here? What about her? - Liliana is sleeping. - Sleeping! It's not good to leave her alone. You should've stayed with her. Why? Because she's a young girl and we're responsible for her. I'd be the third wheel over there. Instead, the two of us can stay here. I'm not tired at all. Checco, what a dinner, right? Hug me. Your hands are freezing, are you cold? - Why did you say third wheel? - Those two have an agreement. That one is a slut, my dear, she'll become worse than Valeria. Have you seen Valeria? She's something else! And the duke didn't know how to turn her down. He's so polite. I told him you were my husband. In any case, we'll get married sooner or later won't we? What is it? Listen. That's Mr. Renzo's door. He was down the hall, waiting for me to leave. It's not true. Good night to all dreamers. Excuse me, just a minute. - Where are you going? - Just wait. Listen, excuse me. Excuse me. Listen. Come here. - What do you want? - Just one minute, come. Come here. Don't move and leave me alone. - What do you want? - She's not the type, you're mistaken. Get lost. You're not getting in here. She's just a child, shame on you. Don't be ridiculous. - Who is it? What's going on? - You ate here, drank... What the hell do you want, for Christ's sake? Out! I ate, drank. I'm a gentleman, so I'll pay for it all. How much? - Clown. - Tell me how much. Clown! Mr. Checco! This beggar, ragamuffin clown. I have to take orders in my own house now. Dear sir - Out! Everybody out! What have you done? - Melina. - Papa! Checco, help me. - Goodbye. - Good morning. I work with this! I work with my facial expression, dear friend. Where's my money? It's so good to see you. I came just the other day. I'll call you. - He was one of my team. - Really? - Maestro, dear maestro. - Who is it? - I heard you're forming a company. - Yes, good day. Let me introduce you. Liliana Antonelli, we are a team. - Please, I'm talking to the lady. - I also know how to dance! I'll show you some pictures. - Please, leave me alone. Understand? - All right. Calm down. What kind of behavior is this? Wait a second. Sir, dear sir. - Just one word, please. - Tomorrow. That's just how he is, you know? Yes, we'll come to an agreement, no doubt about it. Everything will be set up just the way you want it. - Are you done? - One moment, miss. It's all right. Just as long as it stays on tonight. When will you be back tonight? I lock the door. I don't know. Give me the keys. You like it here? It's nice. It's for me! Hello? Mr. Checco? I'm ready. Hurry up because it's getting late. I rented it for a low price but it looks very nice. Fine. What? In 15 minutes, half an hour? Did you talk to Mr. Parmisano? - Well, did you or not? - Yes, of course. He'll come. They'll all come. It's a place for artists. In 20 minutes then. Mr. Edmondo, I demand my suit now. - For God's sake. - Get your hands off me! Don't curse and act like a tough guy, nobody makes a fool out of me. "Tomorrow, the day after tomorrow." I've had enough. When you pay me, I'll give you the suit. - When will you pay me? - Leave it. Oh, Lord. You crook! I'm closing the hotel. You'll see what I'll do to you. Cry, cry, baby. It'll do you good. Cry. - Good evening. - Here you go. Thank you. You'll see. Come now. Please. Is Mr. Parmisano here? I can't say, there are so many people. Would you like to order? But I didn't eat, I thought we would eat here. Well, I ate already, order a small dish for yourself. Beef soup, appetizers, turkey fillet, oysters, partridge, pheasant? Don't you have something a bit lighter? - Lobster? - That's it. - But the lobster - - Lobster. And wine? - That one over there. - Champagne. - And you sir? - Rhubarb cordial. - Straight. - Very well. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. My friends and I are actors, this is the truth. We've traveled all over, we were even in Belgium, the Netherlands, and all over England performing our acts. So if you like what we do, do this with your hands. I mean applaud, give us some compliments. It tastes just like soda. Waiter, bring me some beer without the foam. - Fine. - So, is this Mr. Parmisano here yet? One moment. Ladies and gentlemen, good evening. I present Cocoledo, the biggest attraction in the world. Cocoledo will say good evening to the cabal/eras. Cocoledo, say good evening to the cabal/eras. Cocoledo will recite a poem by the great Giosue Carducci, "The Ox." "I love thee..." - Mama! - What's wrong, Cocoledo? A Penguin. A penguin? Where? Cocoledo, that's not a penguin. It's a nice gentleman. - Do you like the penguin? - No. - Who do you like then? - The female penguin. - The female penguin? - Yes. The devil! Shall we dance? You said you knew many people, but instead... They'll be here later. Get down! Dance closer, guys! Mr. Parmisano! Sir! See, what did I tell you? One moment. Sir! - Bye,bye. - Sir, please. Sir, one moment please. Enough, you two. Come, Patrizia, let's dance. Yes, yes, we met each other last September in Stresa. - Maybe so. - Are you an actress? Well, I... I've seen you some place. But I guess my head's in the clouds. That's the kind of guy I am. May I? Adelmo Conti. - Are you a movie actress? - No, variety, dance. Ah! Maybe I saw you dancing with our very own Wandissima? - Actually, I'm just starting out. - Scotch, I've already had three. However, I won a 70-hour dance competition. Then they crowned me Queen of the Beach. So you really are just starting out, poor little thing. You'll need help. I am Parmisano's partner. - Sir... - Look what the cat dragged in! Do you know Liliana Antonelli? Liliana, me and him go way back. Good old Adelmo. It's so good to see you. It means that you're not in jail. In jail! What a guy, he's always joking. Adelmo, let's get out of here. It's too hot. - Yes, we're wasting time in here. Coming? - With pleasure. Have you met Dal Monte the comedian? - The penguin? - The penguin. Maria, Luigino, Nadeli, Patrizia, all my friends. Liliana won a 70-hour beauty contest on the beach. Good old Checco! Quite a girl he's found. Come on. She's not only pretty, she can dance, sing. I'm building an act for her and I wanted to talk to Parmisano. Could you maybe... Sure. I'll do even more for Liliana. Let's go. Very well, let's go. The check, sir. Please. One moment. I'm not going to disappear, am I? Here you are. 1,250. -200 lire, sir? - Keep it. - No, 200 are missing. - Count it again. I'll sit in the front. Wait a second! So, is there room for me? No, we're too many already. - Take a taxi! - We're going to the Florida! Damn! Excuse me, have you seen a girl with two guys in a big car? - Mr. Adelmo? - Yes. He came here, then he left. He went that way. - Where did he go? - I don't know. - Thank you. - You're welcome, good evening. - Here's the grand showman! - Hi, Remo. What are you doing in a suit? Working in cabaret? There's a party, they're waiting for me. Can I borrow 500 Lira in small bills? I have to take a cab. Just what are you up to? A 48-year-old man. -42. -45. Fine. - Did you hear the latest gossip? - About what? About what an idiot Checco is. - Who says so? - Everybody. Me, first of all. It's jealousy. Wasn't Melina good enough for you? - That's my business. - She was honest, caring. She washed for you, ironed for you, cooked for you, had savings. The last thing you needed was Liliana Antonelli. She uses you. Uses me? Come on. Where are you going, you wretch? Listen to those who care for you. She's even cheating on you. - What? - She's cheating. - Repeat it. - Cheating! You foolish people. You don't understand. She's a woman with class. She loves me. She should be respected. Then you'll see. You'll all see. Every performer in Italy will take notice of our success. Go on, poor schmuck! Mr. Checco, we looked all over for you. Your friend is nice. We had so much fun. I don't know how to thank you. - He expects us tomorrow. - Open up. Will you call me? Good night. Come on. Where do you think you're going? Mrs. Rosetta is sleeping now. All the better. My child, what did you have in mind? Just because I've always respected you, do you think I'm a fool? Look there, count them. They are 32 women. Each one prettier than the next and they all loved and respected me. They made a great fuss over me. And you... Give me that. I understand you, you're a schemer. You build your cold, calculating schemes. So I'll make my calculations too. I did some things for you. Because I like you, I really do. So let's go then. Let's go. Sure. But you... So it's... Did you understand what I said? Damn it. Wait, don't go like this. Come up for a moment. Better? If you need to hit me to blow off steam, go ahead then. You don't wear a beret with a suit. You actually shouldn't have worn the suit in the first place. You're a nice guy, you know? So did you bed all 32 girls while wearing this beret? Don't get mad, I'm joking. I'm doing it because I care for you. In my own way, understand? You don't have to be jealous of all those who want to help me. You and I will go so very far. I know you've been unlucky and that you're talented, very talented. Just think of it, Mr. Checco, what a success. - Where? - Everywhere. We'll have shows in all the theaters, with big signs, in colors, with my name this high, and yours too, shiny, up on top of the theater roof, flicking on and off. And the house is packed. And I walk down the stairs, all covered with feathers. Look, Mr. Checco, I've got goose bumps. "It's raining, over the thirsty dead trees, over the myrtle." I'm an artist. So are you, you've got spunk, spunk. You'll see, you and I together, always. I'll be the impresario. I don't need anyone. I'll put together the company, I promise you. May I? Good night. I'm going to rest a little bit. Yes, this is it, Liliana. I can feel it. Good morning. I work with this. I use my face, my friend. With this! We'll debut in Rome, then Naples, then Salerno, to Pescara and maybe Sicily too. A great tour, right? You should see the script. All French spirit, American stuff. - Who wrote it? - It's mine. It's all in my head. The title is "Thunderbolts and Sparks". There's a fantastic role for you. Better than Beckett. Sure, but let's talk money now. That's also an area of total innovation: no more salaries. Nothing, we'll be one society, a family. Goodbye. - Where are you going? - I'm leaving. - Who'll be the boss? - I will. - What? - What do you mean "what"? You heard me. Waiter, how much is it? I'll pay for the coffee and that's the end of it. You want to form a company to make a dancer out of that klutz? You know what I say? Go ahead and form your company, but stop bothering people who work. - Who's the klutz? - Melina, come hear Cheese's latest joke! He's become an impresario! Your vulgarity is repulsive, but it's over for you, my dear. As an actress, you're dead. Even worse, you never even started. The nerve! 40 years in showbiz, 50 years of people ridiculing him. The great comedian! Wretch, beggar! Leave me alone! Someone has to tell him the truth. He's never seen himself on stage. I bought a goose You're nothing but a cheap courtesan. I'll show you who Valeria del Sole is! Impresario? That'll be the day. Melina, what happened? I'm an artist and I don't want to compromise. - What do you care? - But that woman - What did they do to you? Nothing, we were just talking. - Do you like it? - Nice. It was very cheap, I only paid 5,000 now, the rest next week. I had 3,000 left. Well... Here you go. It's for you. No, let me do that. Look at them! Unbelievable. It really suits you. Very nice indeed. - And the company? - We'll do it. We'll do it. We have to. I want to see where he's sleeping, the owner locked his room. Mr. Edmondo! Cut it out! Mr. Edmondo is sleeping, my dear. Sleeping, get it? Until you pay, you won't set foot in this house ever again! And I'll report you! You're holding my personal belongings. It's wrongful, against the law and against the constitution. You'll receive a registered letter in the morning. - Enough! - Go kill yourself. Nasty old Edmondo. What a neighborhood, what characters. The guy's a rascal. What are you laughing at? Beautiful. Give me that. Rough times for artists. - You an artist? - Checco Dal Monte, impresario. Come to my place with me. - Where do you live? - Rome is my home. All the squares, all the streets are mine. I'm homeless just like you. Granada of my loves The lament of the cante jondo - Moema! - Hi! I'll keep your tears for myself For life matters not to me This is a great Brazilian artist, Moema. I love crossing paths at night with those who are free like you, and crazy like me. In America, I was a chemical engineer. But I like music. In Italy I feel right at home. I feel free here. I can come here, go there, without a dime. Just like a swallow. - Play something, Moema. - Something very authentic. Let's hear it. My lemon, my lemon tree My fair jacaranda tree Very nice. Let's hear some more of that song. - But lower your voice. - Thank you. My lemon, my lemon tree My fair jacaranda tree One time with a tindo le-le Another time with a tindo la-la Tindo Ie-Ie is a promise An adventure that begins With a smile of love Tindo Ia-Ia is arriving The day is beginning With a dawn of longing My lemon, my lemon tree My fair jacaranda tree That's enough, you tramps! What do you mean "tramps"? We are true artists! Yeah, it's art, get it? - Okay, okay. - Play more quietly. You two are mine. Don't deal with anyone else, I'll book you. I know many great artists, all poor. A Hungarian choreographer, a midget hunchback who leaps in the air. A cowboy who can shoot a teeny fly from far, far away. - Where is that man? - He's at the flophouse. You hear that, tram driver? The flophouse. It's always the same, the best are always poor. Let's go there right now. Enough with the usual professionals, filled with conceit and demands. The time of the unknown artists has come. You'll be the stars of my new show. You're invited to the premiere. Bye. Come, John. Good night, partner. Good night... Granada of my loves The lament of the cante jondo Granada of my loves The lament of the cante jondo I'll keep your tears for myself For life matters not to me Fabulous. Which one is he? - What do you want? - I'm looking for a friend. A friend? Wake up, it's morning. You want to perform in the theater? Here's a great manager. Today's your lucky day. Just show me what you can do. HE'S good! I told you she's sleeping. - Who is it? - It's me, Checco. Good morning, sleep well? I came early because... Am I disturbing you? My apologies, but last night, you wouldn't believe the people I met. I'm tired, can't you see? Do me a favor and let me sleep. - Who are they? - Those are the artists. This is Johnny, he plays trumpet. Play her something. Come on, play. And this is Billy, a sharpshooter. A cast of international talents, a surefire hit, the company's ready! It's ready, Liliana. It's ready. Have you finished? - What is it? - Do me a favor and leave me alone. Talk to the landlady because the room here is quite expensive. I can't go on like this. She won't give you the keys. The toilet is always broken and I want to move to a hotel. - You want to move to a hotel? - Why not? I think I've waited too long. I was at your disposal. I've done everything to help you. I've even rejected a proposal, and I'm still at the same point without a penny. A proposal? From whom? Leave it, you'll break it. Please, get rid of those guys for me. - Liliana, what's wrong? - Can't you see? Please let me sleep, I came back at 5:00 a.m., I'm tired. You want to form a company with these sorts of acts? You'll need money, a lot. I'll find the money, Liliana. Napoleon. Giuseppe Verdi. Garibaldi. Voila! Melina, wait for me. Girls, let's go. Get on stage. Did you see who's here? What a darling. He's here for money. - Don't fall for it. - No chance, I don't even want to see him. Let me handle it. I'm forming my own company. I'll fit your things in, too. Dear partner! Great show, great. How are you, friend? - And Melina's dressing room? - That one. Ah, my dear Valeria. May I... - Get lost. - I have to talk to you. Go ahead, but speak loudly so everyone can hear. It has nothing to do with you. I have to talk to Melina. It's business. I'm forming a company. And Melina will pay for it, right? How can you live with yourself? Go away! This is just a misunderstanding, it's a deal, a capital investment. Go away, get the money from that woman. Melina, I'll be at the pizzeria with your father. I'm coming. That wicked idiot. What has she done to you? Weren't you better off with me? So why did you leave? I couldn't... What's that? I don't know, I don't know, she bewitched me. Idiot. And why should I give you my money? No, no, don't give it to me. Don't. I don't deserve it. I don't deserve anything. I'm a dead man anyway. It was my last chance and you know it, Melina. Because the theater is everything to me, I was born and will die on stage. This would have been my own company. Everybody was against me. Envy, jealousy. After 30 years on the stage, it would've been the turning point for me. Melina, it's all ready to go, all the acts, the black guy, Buffalo Bill, and the script, what a great script! And I've got to throw in the towel because I'm a poor bastard with no money. I'd just need a small amount. Take it, but go away and don't ever come back. You're the best, Melina. I'll give it back to you with interest. My first profit will be yours and yours alone, because you'll be part of my company, won't you, Melina? Melina, take a look at this act. Bill, the daisy. One, two, three, four - Stop! It's horrible, no good. There's no rhythm, the whole thing is worthless. Please join in too! Again. One, two, three, four... Gentlemen. I present Liliana Lilly, the star of the company. Liliana, here is your company: Valeria, a magnificent soloist. Moema, a Brazilian gypsy. The famous maestro Dubriovsky, a celebrity. Mitzy, the Hungarian. The choreographer. Girls, the dance. Mafia, Lucia, Ruth, Dedi and Tame. Our Tanio, the golden idol, you'll see. - What is this stuff? - The company's poster. Checco Dal Monte and Liliana Lilly. I've ordered some bigger, nicer ones. Don't you think my name should come first? Yes. It could. Now let's start the rehearsal with "A Night in Paris." Keep training. Calm down. One, two. You stupid morons! One, two. Stop. What is this? You're all good for nothing. Can't you raise a leg? Like the rest of Italy, you know nothing about this type of dancing. It is an art passed down from mother to daughter in my country. Let's do it again. One, two. He's a great Russian musician. What do you want from me? I play what I feel like playing, got it? - What does he want from me? - Calm down. My contract says I can play whatever I want, right? - Otherwise I'll drop everything. - Try again. I am the choreographer, I always did what I wanted to. Gentlemen. Commendatore. My dear sir. Dal Monte. The pleasure's all mine. Hey, everyone. I'm pleased to introduce Mr. Torello of the Excelsior Theater. He gives us the honor of attending a rehearsal. Lilly is missing, she's the star, my discovery. I called but - - Try again. - She left two hours ago. She'll get fined. Shall we start anyway? Shall we? - This way. - Yes, let's get started. Come girls, we're starting. Hurry! The Hungarian is really something. Gentlemen, I'll give you a brief explanation. The ballet of mine you're about to see represents through dance the tremendous struggle between good and evil. - I'll go in alone. - Fine, Liliana, I'll wait here. If you need me, call. What is this tired face? I passed night after night and I don't feel tired because I'm inspired by dance. But you have to change your expression. Your mouths and eyes are all wrong. Please, make that adjustment. Go, yes. Liliana, where have you been? Get dressed, we have rehearsal now. The man from the theater is here. Mr. Checco, I have great news. Don't move. Do you remember that night when we dreamed of a big company? Rome, Milan, Paris... I'm really going to Milan and maybe to Paris. I'm to debut as a showgirl in Parmisano's company. I've just signed the contract. And it's all thanks to you, I can never thank you enough. I'm so happy, Mr. Checco! Your friend Mr. Adelmo is out there. He wants to talk with you about my buyout. Shall I call him? There's no need for a buyout. The rehearsals are going well, right? I'll come here tomorrow to watch. Don't you have anything to say to me? You did the right thing. Go on. Follow your destiny. - Mr. Checco. - Just go. Will you come to my debut? Damn, I have to make these improvements. Girls, I can't see the fire, please. What are you doing over there? I need you over there as a tree. Come here, please, right away. This is your position, please. Come on. - Yes, everyone. - The rehearsal will - Please, everyone. Checco, what's wrong? What is this child doing in here? Come here, please. Mind the cables, madam. She's coming. Step aside. Here. Up you go. Plug her in. Hurry UP- That's good. Now that you're full of perfume, get up there! Start the elevator, go. - You beast! - I hope you die. Tormentedly, I still love you Desperately, you remain in my heart - It's this one? - Yes, it is. Good evening. 18,19. Are the tickets all right? - Here. Take the cat. - Thank you, dear. Which newspaper would you like? - Epoca, Bis, Bolero and Oggi. - Fine. Train departing on Platform 4. Direct service to Florence-Bologna-Milan. I'm going to Milan, we debut there. - Well done. - I had a great success, you know? Me too. I produced a beautiful show. I signed a Viennese ballet company. The premiere is tomorrow, we debut in... Where? Goodbye! Ready to go, sir. Hurry. Get on, sir. Two days in Bisceglie. One day in Molfetta. - What about Trani? - Trani only shows movies. - Any advance payments? - You wish! Finally. I love you, can't I love you? Come on. Excuse me, is this seat free? Yes, go right ahead. Do you want some coffee? I'll get it from the maestro. - What? - Excuse me, I didn't say anything. Sorry, I thought you... Are you an actress? Strange, you're just the type. I know what I'm talking about. I'm an impresario. Are you? I run a variety show. - Pretty. - Thank you. Very pretty.
