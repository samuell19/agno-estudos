Man: Vaya con dios! [ No audio ] You created all this, Roger. How can you give it up for good? Because I wouldn't put Leah and Susan through another 10 years of loneliness out here. And because I couldn't turn down the company's reward for this exile -- that house by the ocean in California, my own laboratory, and a life's income. Who could ask for more? Any other man who saved corbett at least $20 million. I'm not greedy. Come on. Let's get to the airport. Vaya con dios! Roger: Vaya con dios -- go with god. I'd given orders -- no goodbyes, either at the mine or at the plant or at the airstrip. I was saying goodbye to 10 years of work, of friendship. The plan was that my wife and daughter would wait at the plane, and we'd quietly fly away from those 10 long, isolated years, 1,000 miles from nowhere on the Chilean desert in South America. [ Engine shuts off ] Here, Bob. Wear it in good health. Vaya con dios. Oh, my darlings. Engineers are notoriously lousy at words. How can I thank you for the years that you've given me here? Because we love you. For the rest of my life, I'm going to make it up to you. I promise you. Bye, Bob! Bye, Roberto! So long, Bob. When we reached Valparaiso, Chile, Susan reentered a world she had forgotten existed. She was excited... And she was scared. Póngalos aquí, por favor. Man: Suite "b." Right this way, Mr. and Mrs. Slade. Mr. Corbett always reserved this suite for himself. He wired me and asked me to make you comfortable, and that, I will. Roger: Well, that's very thoughtful of him. Would you like this bedroom, susie dear? That'll be fine. [ Door closes ] Bye! Bye! Bye! Bye! Bye! Bye! May I? [ Chuckles ] Oh. Who do you know that I know? I don't understand. Well, we've both, obviously, been visiting Chile. We must know someone in common. I--i don't think so. I just lived on the atacama desert for 10 years, and we don't have very many Americans there. You'll have to excuse me. I'm not very good at talking to strangers. [ Horn blows ] Oh, Mr. Slade, I'm delighted to see that we're going to be neighbors. My name is con white. Any relation to the con white aluminum corporation? He's my father. This is Mrs. Slade. How do you do? Hello, Mrs. Slade. Have you been in Chile on your father's business? No, ma'am. On my own. What's your business? Well, I climb mountains. Oh, that's a business? [ Horn blows ] [ Horn blows ] Oh, daddy, you shouldn't have bought me all these beautiful clothes in Santiago. I'll never be able to wear them all. You will if you snag that good-looking, young mountain climber. He's the best-looking man on shipboard, outside of your father. I wouldn't know how. [ Laughs ] I'm just too excited to sleep. I guess I'll just go do some deck-walking. I'm afraid I stole more than 10 years of susie's life out there. I robbed her of her sense of security in the outside world. Just speaking with that handsome lad completely undid her. When you asked me for our first date, I stammered and blushed, too, and I was a sophisticated model, remember? All it meant was that I desperately wanted you to like me. Do you realize your daughter has never been properly kissed? How do you know? And what do you mean by "properly"? Well, "improperly," then. You know, the way people in love kiss. She told me. Remember that college boy she worked with in the laboratory last summer? He seems to have been inadequate as a kisser. She stopped him from doing it. She said there must be more to it or she'd have no part of it. Ha ha ha ha ha ha. God help her if she finds a young man she really wants to love. She's stored up a lot to give. Con: Beautiful, isn't it? That's the southern cross. And now I know somebody that you know, so we can talk. Well, I met your parents. We can talk about them. And we know that--that you're Susan and I'm con, and, uh, you go for deserts, while I'm hot for peaks... And not just through doors, either. Tell me why you cl-climb mountains. I often wondered about people who did that. So have I. Oh, we're a crazy lot. We all know that mountains hate people, but still we keep looking for new peaks to conquer. Why, give one of US a virgin peak, and we'd dream about her. I'd get jealous of the men who beat US to her. Have, uh, you ever climbed any in Chile? Virgins? Yes. Yes. Two of them. And the highest peak in the whole western hemisphere -- aconcagua. How high was that? Uh, 22,834 feet. You know, the--the Indians believe the bigger the mountain, the more powerful the spirit inside it. Strange. You get the feeling that she's out to kill you -- yourself, personally. And sometimes she does. Have you ever lost any, uh, friends climbing? Yes. There's a peak in Peru named yerupaja. It means "world of ice," but they call her "the butcher." 21,759 feet high... And a butcher she is. I...i lost my partners climbing it. Very old, dear friends. They're still up there... What's left of them... At the bottom of a crevasse. You see, we're all idiots -- mountain climbers. When we gamble, we gamble the biggest stakes we possess -- our lives. But when we win... When we win, we're the proudest men on earth. Don't ask me why. That's just the way it is. You become a fatalist, Susan... Like me knowing we'd be here together like this. You know, I haven't even looked at the other girls on board. I knew it had to be you. I--i should imagine you'd have m-much more fun with the other girls on board. Why? Well, uh, because I can tell that you'd--you'd like to kiss me, but I'm not very good at it. Why not? The same reason i--i don't think I could climb a mountain. I haven't had enough practice. It's a long...Long way to San Francisco. [ No audio ] [ Theme from "a summer place" plays ] ** ** After they...Leave, will you...Stay awhile? I love you. It's 4:00 in the morning. We played music, and there were several couples there. All of them making love, hmm? I think I was wrong about con. I think he's been around too much for you. He loves me... And I love him. Don't lose your head, darling. Good night. We're nearing dock, sir. Is your luggage ready? Give me 15 minutes, will you? 15 minutes. Yes, sir. [ Sighs ] [ Laughing ] He scared the daylights out of me. I thought it was your mother. I was scareder than that. I thought it was daddy. Feel my heart beat. Mmm. Tell me something. How am I going to last till you get back from Alaska, huh? Tell me. Ha ha. By remembering every moment that I love you beyond belief. [ Laughs ] Even more than mt. McKinley, huh? Now, you swore to me, even after we're married, that you'd never be jealous of a mountain. By the time I've climbed it, my folks will be back to welcome you into the family. Oh, they'll be crazy about you. Are you sure? Mm-hmm. Mine will say we'll have to wait and think it over. Con... Why couldn't we tell them we're engaged? And have me beat it right away to Alaska like a scalded cat? Now, how would that look? It's just that i'm so terribly guilty about making love and all that. I've never kept a thing from my folks. We've always been so close. Now I guess I'll have to... ...'cause we've been sinful. Oh, darling, darling, we can't share our love with anybody. [ Laughs ] After we're married, are you going to call your parents every time we make love? [ Laughs ] Of course not. Then practice keeping it secret now. You know what I'm going to carve on the highest rock of the highest peak in all of North America, to be there forever? "Me, con... Loves you, Susan." Oh, good. [ Horn blows ] [ Horn blowing ] And here I've been cooped up in California all this year. Going through customs always seems to be related to Chinese torture. They haven't seen each other for 10 years. They should have plenty to say to each other. We can start with the time you nearly shot my eye out with an arrow. I almost forgot about that. I didn't. You were a regular William tell. [ Indistinct conversations ] Wait till you see what mother's done at cypress point. It's been her pet project for nearly three months. [ Horn blowing ] Well, here's your key, Roger. Walk in with pride. You've earned everything you see -- every inch of it and a lot more. Oh, daddy. The outside was my doing, but the inside was all Marion's. She knew how much you liked oriental things. And my photographs -- my Chilean photographs. Ha ha ha ha. Now for the view. We thought after all those years on the desert, you'd like to be near the sea. Oh, it's beautiful! Well, I... I'm too moved to speak. I want you to see your bedroom from the garden. You know, I like the kind of flower seeds that you just throw around. I don't like that "plant it 6 inches deep, 2 feet wide, and fertilize it well." And this is Lily. She's going to help you unpack and get you settled. Hello, Lily. She can cook, too. Marion: I think I'm going to cry. It's so much more than I ever, ever dreamed. Susie, this is your room. Oh, I am going to cry. Ha ha ha ha ha. Well, this is all women's stuff. Let's take a look at the lab out back. Son, you take me to court. We'll leave the big car for mother. Wait for me? Yes, sir. And, again, welcome home, Mr. Slade. Thanks. The mine. Mm-hmm. Oh, here's that mineral that you named after me -- corbettite. Ha ha. Biggest honor of my life. Roger, does, um -- does Leah know about your heart condition? No. I had our doctor down there refer to the best man in the west. And they agreed that with rest and a little golf -- you're like ike -- your heart will mend itself. So I heard. That's why I didn't tell Leah. Stanton... Well, isn't there a bigger word than "thanks"? I need one. For this house? Hells bells. I haven't even begun to say thanks to you yet. If I wrote you a check for a million dollars, we still wouldn't be even. My best thanks would be a perfect cardiograph from you. I have a special reason for being grateful for loyalty today. Do you remember John brecker? Your chief accountant. Yes. Well, he not only forgot to be loyal, he stole $10,000 in the process. That's why i'm, uh, due in court. Well, you rest up now. You're being welcomed into the club tonight. You were elected in absentia. Lots of old friends here -- human, as well as mineral. Corbettite. Yep. Nicest thing that ever happened to me. Thank you, god... For everything -- my friends... My family... And my life. It's the duty of this court to pass sentence. John brecker... You are hereby sentenced to not less than 5 and not more than 10 years in the state penitentiary. Mr. Corbett... Hoyt. Above every man on earth, I thought you knew my father wasn't a thief. Hoyt, other men have given their lives to my companies with honor and been rewarded. The dishonest are punished. The money's not important, hoyt. But when faith is lost, when honor dies, the man is already dead. Who do you think you are -- god?! Knock it off, hoyt. No, but god will have to help your father now because I can't. Father! * susie has a birthday * * I'm so glad * * I hope it's the happiest birthday * * susie ever had * happy birthday. Happy birthday. Surprise. Surprise? Come on. Is it con? Up and at 'em. No fair asking questions. If it is, I better put some lipstick on and brush my teeth. You won't need any lipstick for this. Come on. Chulo, you're about to meet your new owner. I know that she'll love you. We ask that you love her just as much. Thank you, daddy. Hi, chulo. I'm Susan. Do you like me? Would you mind terribly if I sat in the saddle? You hop right up. [ Shutter clicks ] Oh, he's big! Ha ha ha. Oh, he's beautiful. Mmm! I've always dreamed of having a pinto. I love him, daddy. Thank you. He's pretty frisky, miss. He just arrived last night. This is hoyt brecker, Susan. This is Mrs. Slade. Hoyt will take care of him for you at the stables. Can she have a ride after breakfast? I'll give him a ride first, sir, to make sure. Guess I'm in my pajamas and all. I better go change my clothes. When may I expect you, miss? I'll skip breakfast. You're the best of allpossible parents. Oh, darling, happy birthday! I can't wait to ride him! Ha ha. Here you are, hoyt. And thanks. That's the boy whose father stole from the corbetts. Marion thinks he's pretty brazen to stay on up here. Most of their friends have transferred their horses to the pebble beach stables. So you thought he could use a break. Well, the boy's stables are within walking distance... When she isn't hoarding our mailbox. That's the first happy look I've seen on her face since we got here. He still hasn't written? Not for two weeks. He's sitting up there in Anchorage waiting for the weather to break. I think it's cruel. Well, I suppose there's a lot to do getting ready to climb a mountain. Good morning! Morning! Oh, how beautiful. Hi. Is that the hoyt brecker stable over there? Yes, it is, ma'am. Oh, he's beautiful. He should be, ma'am. This is captain topper, the world-champion stud. Oh, great. See you later! Mm-hmm. Hi! Hi. I guess your horse hasn't been ridden in about a month. He's too much to handle right now. I've ridden all my life. All he needs to do is let off a little steam. I'll give him a good ride. I don't recommend it. It's my birthday present and my horse, and I'm going to ride him. It's your horse, and it's your neck. That's right. Do you know who I am? Yes. And I'm sorry about your father. Do you want to keep your horse here? Yes. Why? Ever since the trial, everybody else doesn't. Why don't you brush that off your shoulder? Brush what off? That chip you're expecting everybody else to knock off for you. You'd scare anybody away. It doesn't seem to scare you. You're going to find I don't scare very easy. Now, will you open that gate and let me out of here? [ Horn honking ] [ Whinnying ] [ Whistles ] [ Whinnies ] [ Coughing ] What, may I ask, are you doing? Seeing if anything's broken. Do you have to feel me to find out? Do you know a better way? [ Sighs ] Nothing's hurt except my pride. Where's chulo? Headed back to the stables. Let's go get him. What for? Do you want him to say all my life he threw me on my birthday? Well, of course not, but then I didn't realize he was a talking horse. Oh, con, why? [ Ringing ] Woman: I'm sorry, sir. There's no answer on your call to monterey. Are you sure? Yes, sir. Well, try that San Francisco number I gave you. Very well, sir. Any luck? No, just some more acceptances. Everybody's coming to our party. Have you called Wells corbett yet? No. Well, then get right on the phone and do it. And what about your dress? I--i didn't see anything I liked in carmel. Well, take the train up to San Francisco and get something. Everyone we like is coming to our party, and we want them all to fall in love with you. Fat chance. I'm the woman god forgot. I think I will go to city in the morning. Do, susie dear, and get something that's really smart and good-looking with a short skirt to show off your pretty ankles. Go call Wells now. He adores you. [ Footsteps ] How do you do? Good morning. I just stopped by to see if Mr. and Mrs. White have returned from their trip yet. No, miss, but they're expected within the week. What do you hear from con? Is he still in Alaska? Yes, miss. He called long-distance just last night to see when his family was due. Has he climbed his mountain yet? No. He says the weather's still so awful, there's absolutely nothing to do but wait. He's still in Anchorage. Who shall I say called, miss? Just a friend. Thank you. [ Thinking ] Oh, con. Nothing to do but wait? Nothing? Operator: Hello. Uh, site 013998. Woman: Dr. Morley's office. I'm only going to be in town for a short while, I wondered if I could see the doctor for a brief time. For what purpose, please? Examination, please. Are you ill? Well, i--i think I'm pregnant, and I'd like to make sure. Your name, please? Uh, the name is, um, Mrs. Leah Rogers. Thank you. [ Thinking ] What will I do? What will I do? Dear god, what will I do? Con will get my cable tonight, and he'll call me. And he'll come to me, and everything will be alright. [ Horn honking in distance ] Hoyt: Cab, lady? Thank you. I was expecting a horse on the train, but I'll settle for you. What's the matter? You look kind of pale. I had a very big day. I guess I'm a little shaky. I skipped lunch. Well, we can fix that fast with some tea at the pier. Alright. Hold my mail. [ Sea gull screeching ] Please don't let me stop you from opening your mail. This one I'm itching to open. You write? Yes. I'm sorry. I just happened to notice it was from a publishing company. I don't mean to pry in your personal affairs. Have you ever seen a rejection slip? This time I had such hopes. Well, there are other publishing houses. You mustn't lose hope. That chip on my shoulder, is it still there? You know why? You're the first person since the trial who hasn't looked at me like I'm a criminal. Like father, like son, and all that. The other people don't believe that, hoyt. Not everybody. Maybe not. Maybe they just wonder. Where do you do your writing? When? Nights at the stables. I've sold over a dozen stories under a pen name. That's why you didn't leave. I've sworn to make it up to him right here where it all happened. I'll never run away. They're going to have to take me and like it. Do you know what? I think one day in monterey, they'll put a very big sign saying "Robert Louis Stevenson and John steinbeck and hoyt brecker wrote here." Thank you for coming to my rescue. Thanks for coming to mine. I needed you today. Uh, I'm expecting a call about 9:00. Would you mind if I take it in your room? If you close the door, we won't hear a single, solitary word. Is tonight the big night? Did she get a letter from con? A wire? Well, then how does she know he's going to call? Maybe she just said her prayers. It was that last move that made you -- It's midnight, susie dear. It's time to go to bed. Maybe all the telephone wires were tied up by the military, especially in Alaska. Maybe he'll write to you tomorrow. [ Door opens ] Leah: Susie dear? While you're dressing, you mind if I bring up the oldest girl talk in the world -- men? It's your bad luck to have fallen in love with a fine young man who has, perhaps, only one real shortcoming. And that is that he comes first in his life. This is a rather common and human frailty in handsome, rich young men. And it isn't only restricted to them or the handsome or the young. But the key to all such males is that to each of them, what he wants is of prime importance in his life, whether it's climbing a mountain or...merely satisfying an urge. Oh, believe me, susie dear, there will come a day, a great and joyous day, when you'll know some man to whom you are heaven and earth and all things to him day and night. And he won't hide his love or lock it up. He'll let you know in any one of a hundred ways whenever he can because love is and must be a sharing. Con was that way on the ship. Darling, they have a name for it -- shipboard romances. Oh, mother, you make it sound so cheap! It was much more than that. Much more. Maybe con's just sick, and he's afraid to worry me or something. Maybe he's already up there, scouting the first base for his climb. Without writing or calling or a single word? Susie, I think you have to face this awful truth that con's at that time of his life, common to all too many young men, when there isn't anything oranybody more important to them than themselves. And so they set out to prove themselves in many strange ways, some of them by driving hot rods at 100 miles an hour, or some of them by playing chicken. Some of them have to make a conquest of every girl they meet on land or sea. And some of them have to build their muscles on the muscle beaches of the world. Some of them feel compelled to climb mountains. Con is not unsure. Are you sure? No, I think you must wait until he's grown up a little. Until he's learned the meaning of unselfishness. Until he's learned the joy of wanting to put himself second to the girl he loves. If there's one thing I've learned out of life, it's that true love must come before, above, and beyond self. Mother, it is that way with me. Now, I love him more than you or daddy or anything on earth. And I know how awful that sounds. No, it doesn't. If it's reciprocated, that's the way it should be. How many letters have you written him? I write every day. You give. He receives. He doesn't give back. Oh, susie dear, that's not love as it should be. Love's what your daddy's given me all these years, from the beginning. Do you know what he did on our first parting? He had to inspect some mines in Canada. He wrote to me every night, then on the way home, he got off at every station, and he sent me a wire just to let me know how important I was to him. He made me feel I was more important than life itself and he still does. Sometimes, it's just by touching my hand and my cheek in the middle of the night. But he lets me know... And I adore him for it. And one day, you'll adore some man you haven't met. Mother, I have met him. His name is con, and I adore him. Anything for me? There was an airmail special. Could've been for you. They're in back. Thanks. Leah: Of course, we're going to say "no." Roger: But the biggest "no" we've ever said, and the most final. Excuse me. I--i wanted my special-delivery letter. There was no special delivery for you, dear. This one's for your father from the hoover mining company, wanting him to go to Guatemala on a new job. Don't look so scared. We're not going. It's hard to believe after all these years of having to, we don't have to go. It's hard to believe. Wells corbett sent her two dozen roses. I put the box on her bed. Maybe he'll help her start forgetting tonight. He's very handsome. I don't remember love hurting so much. Did it ever? It's the unlove that hurts, darling. Thank god for you. [ Slow dance music plays ] Hi. I think I'm going to start coming down every weekend. Please do. Do you, uh, get any propaganda from your parents? About what? Oh, about what a lovely couple we make. Yes. [ Laughs ] You know, usually parents are the worst matchmakers in the world, I always used to say. Oh, I'm so proud of her. Yeah, so am I. How about your riding? I ride every day. Good. Would you...Mind if I rode with you soon? No. [ Music stops ] [ Applause ] Would you like some punch? Yes, I think so. Susie dear, your dress is just perfect, and you're getting raves and compliments on all sides. Wells hasn't looked at another girl tonight. You know, I can't tell you how proud I am of you gals, how lucky I feel. I don't envy anybody in the world tonight. [ Chuckling ] Daddy. Miss, there's a long-distance call from a Mr. White for you. Roger: It's about time, isn't it? Oh, yes. Yes! Please don't let anybody in. I'd like to be alone. Hello. Con? Woman: Miss Susan Slade? Yes, it is. One moment, please. San Francisco calling. Oh, he's home. He's home. Man: Is this Susan Slade? Yes. This is con's father speaking. He wrote US a note about you, telling US of his love for you. I love him, too, sir. That is why I think you should know... Con was killed this afternoon in the ascent of mt. McKinley. I was told his body is beyond recovery. He was my only child. I'm sure he will live in the hearts of those of US... Who loved him. [ Indistinct conversations, laughter, music ] Nooooo!!!! [ Crying ] [ Horse whinnies ] [ Screaming ] Noooo!! I want to die!! [ Sobbing ] I want to die. [ Slow dance music plays ] Susie. Susie? [ Doorbell rings ] Susan's at my place. She's unconscious. I called a doctor -- a doctor? What happened? The chap that she loved -- he was killed. She wanted to join him. Oh, my god. Can you take US to her? She's asleep. I found her in hysterian shock, so I gave her morphine. She won't wake up till dawn at the very earliest. I put her to bed and hung her wet clothes up there to dry. She's learned a bitter lesson too young. In the midst of life, we are in death. I, uh, never dreamed she cared so much. There's nothing you can do until morning. If I were you, I'd go back to my friends, then come back at dawn. She might wake and want me. There's no need of our friends bearing the burden of her grief. Hoyt, can you sit with her until we say goodbye to them? I'll be back within the hour. [ Door closes ] [ Car doors shut ] [ Engine turns over ] She hasn't moved. Do you have someplace you can sleep downstairs? There's a bunk in the tack room. My wife and I think that i'd better hold the fort at home. Call me if anything's needed. I'll carry her to the car in the morning, you bring her clothes. I've already brought some. Goodbye, darling. I'll call you first thing in the morning. [ Door closes ] [ Gasps ] Con? Con? Our baby. [ Crying ] Our baby! Susan? What are you saying, Susan? Mother? Yes, sweetheart. I'm going to have a baby. Susan. No. What am I gonna do? What am I gonna... If you'd have told me, not try to carry the whole thing by yourself. You know how dearly your daddy and I love you. You mustn't tell daddy. He loves you. Oh, no. I couldn't bear it if you told daddy. Darling, you're his child. He has a right to know. Please, mother, I'll do anything. [ Crying ] Don't tell daddy, please. I think the best place to think this out is at home. I think I'd better tell her now. Alright. Operator: Long distance. Operator, I want to speak to Guatemala City. Susie dear, there is a way, and we found it. I'll do anything you say, mother. Your father has contracted for the hoover mining job in Guatemala. He flies there immediately. The company's need is urgent. Oh, no, you can't do that. I won't let you. This is your dream house. Why don't you let me go someplace? The house won't run away. We can rent it, after two years, when the contract is up, we'll come back. Can't we go to another town? Where could we go? And forever run the risk of meeting someone from here who might guess the truth? No, susie dear. You'll be safer in Guatemala, away from everyone. How can we ever come back with my... With my baby. Yours? Mine. It's the only way, Susan. I'm still young enough to have another child. We'll be in Guatemala for two years. Who's to know? No, mother, I can't change your lives and your hopes! You and daddy -- it's not daddy and I. It's we three. We belong to one another. This is going to be as difficult for your father as it is for you. He has to go to Mr. Corbett later tonight and give a reasonable explanation for our sudden decision. It won't be easy. And then tomorrow he flies to Guatemala to survey the job. There is very little time left for you to go to him. Please? Daddy, I... Oh, there. Don't try to talk. Don't even explain. Just know we love you. Oh, daddy, please don't hate con. Please don't. [ Crying ] If he'd have known, he would have come and made everything right. I know that. And if I couldn't believe that, I would really want to die. I would die. You must believe that, dear. We must all believe that. I almost missed our farewell luncheon. I don't know what ails me these mornings. I lost my breakfast again. Have you seen a doctor? It's not that important. It's just that in the morning I feel queasy, and then by afternoon I feel great, and in the evening I'm ravenous. Last night I ate a whole dill pickle before I went to bed. I couldn't do that if there was something wrong with my tummy, could I? Let me call Dr. Fayne. Good heavens, no! I'll be fine. It's just that, well, I think it's the excitement of getting ready to leave by Friday. Well, I bet you $100,000 that you're pregnant. At my age? What if it were true? Now, promise me you won't breathe a word to anybody. I'll do my best to see that chulo's treated all right. I wish I could buy him myself, but you know how things are with me right now. I'll miss you more than I can tell you. [ Horse whinnies ] Can I see you off at the airport? Would you mind? That'll be fine. Could I kiss you goodbye? I wouldn't want to embarrass you. I suppose the corbetts will be there, and Wells. I suppose so. You could do it now, though. Woman: Final call for united flight... Good luck! Thank you for everything. Bye-bye. Goodbye. Goodbye, darling. Have a nice flight, now. Thank you. Goodbye! [ Engine turns over ] Dear hoyt, Guatemala seems a million miles from home. Daddy is working in a mine nearly 10,000 feet up below a high peak. The main workings of it are 2,000 feet below that. Human beings reach it by a scary, winding road. The ore comes down in buckets. Why is it that mines are never in cities where the people are but far out in deserts and way up in the mountains where the people aren't? Mother and I live far below by the most beautiful lake in the whole world -- lake atitlán. Oh, I have surprising news for you. Mother's expecting a baby. Write me. I get lonely. Susan. Susan: [ Shouting ] Mother! Ya es tiempo. ...que ayuda lo más posible. He wants you to help as much as you can, dear. Augh! Ah! [ Panting ] Man: Señor Slade! Señor Slade! Teléfono! Larga distancia -- atitlán! Altitude pills. I don't want her to worry. Must be our baby. Hello? Roger! It's a boy! He's fine. She's just fine. Mi esposa. UN hijo! Ha ha ha ha! Muchachos! Muchachos! El patrón ha tenido UN hijo! [ Cheering ] They're cheering our -- our son. I can hear. I wish I could say, "grandson." So do I. Can't I nurse him a little longer? He's had quite enough. It's time for him to go back to his cradle. Oh, sweetheart. [ Sweetly ] You know, it's just as hard for a baby to get himself born as it is for the mommy. He has to work hard, too. That's why they have to sleep so much. So they can rest up. Sh-sh-sh-sh-shhh. Mother. How could I have been afraid to have him? I love him so much already. It's a kind of a wonderful love. I never knew this was possible. And I'm so proud of him. I wouldn't care if the whole world knew. I'm very proud of him. I'm proud he's mine. Susan, listen to what I've got to say because you're going to have to remember it all the rest of your life. Beginning right now, tonight, you're going to have to learn to love your baby within the limits that we planned. And it won't be easy because all the time you'll know he's your baby, but you'll have to act for the rest of your life as if he's mine. Don't you see? It's the only way. For your baby's sake, Susan, you must never, ever betray him or you or US. And you must start right now, thinking, saying to yourself, "this is not my son. This is my little brother." And never, ever think that it doesn't matter that people know, because it has to matter. And it all depends on you. I've hurt you and daddy so much already. I'll never hurt you again, mother... Or my son. From tonight on, he'll... Be my baby brother. I promise. Good night, darling. Dear Susan, I loved your family Christmas card. I took it out and showed it to chulo. Believe it or not, he whinnied when he saw it -- or you, I should say. I'm still working away on the second draft of my book. The corbetts are headed your way. How I envy them. I miss you. I keep telling myself you'll be back someday. That helps the most. Always, hoyt. Hello. Hi, love. Mrs. Corbett: Hello, susie, darling. Mr. Corbett: This is a regular garden of Eden. Wells: Well, what a pretty baby. They're flying home from Chile, and they broke their trip just to see US. Oh, what a precious baby! Awww. You thought you fooled me when you started upchucking your breakfast, but you didn't, not for a minute. I told the girls, you know. Susan, darling, you've changed -- from a girl to a woman. Look at her, Wells. I can't take my eyes off her, mother. Oh, what a precious. He's your image, Leah. Isn't he, Stanton? Mr. Corbett: No, I wouldn't say that. I wouldn't say that at all. Mother, can I hold him for you? I see something different in that little face. Why, look at those eyes. Look how serious they are. Nope. I'd say he takes after his old man. Ha ha ha! And what a gay blade you turned out to be. Why, you put all US old goats to shame. How about it, would you like to fly with US to pebble beach? The plane leaves at 5:00. N-N-No, I-I couldn't-- I couldn't leave my b-baby b-brother. It's the height of the season at pebble beach, Susan. Aren't you just a little homesick? Yes, I guess we all are. We planned to spend Christmas together, didn't we? It's--it's my baby brother's first, uh, Christmas. How long before you finish the job, roge? Oh, before the rains come, I'm sure. I'll bet susie loves this little thing as much as she'll love one of her own. Leah: She does. Don't you, susie? Roger: You folks will have to hurry. Thank you for coming. Say hello to the boys at cypress. Mrs. Corbett: Stanton, hurry. Alright, step on it. Take it easy on those hairpin turns. Bye, now. Don't think I don't know how hard it is and will be for you, dear. After all you've done for me, I've no right to complain. No, you're the one who suffered the most. Probably more than we realized. I'm afraid at first we were more concerned over what people would think than the heartbreak you were going through. I think our panic over your conceiving a child concerned US more than your anguish at losing con. You see, to US, he was still an impulsive, even rash, youngster, while he was the center of your whole world. It took me time to realize that. Yes, he was. Daddy, daddy, now when I think of him, his face doesn't come clear to me. It troubles me. I loved him. I know I loved him. How could I forget him like this? Time does that. It's going on two years now since... Remember, you're growing, susie. And as you grow older, con will always stay young. He can't change. You must...And you will. Because you have great heart and courage. And someday that courage will rebuild your world. Daddy, thank you. Oh, you'll never, never know how much I love you and I appreciate you. Susie! Susie! Susie! Daddy? Daddy? Daddy, what's wrong?! Susan, my pills. They're on my dresser. Quickly, dearest! [ Screaming ] Mother! Mother! Man: Paging Mr. or Mrs. Stanton corbett. Urgent wire at telegraph desk. Mr. or Mrs. Stanton corbett. I'm corbett. Thank you. Oh, my god. And we just said goodbye. I'm going to catch the next plane back to them. Those girls can't handle this alone, with the baby and all. Did you know that I was his executor? He wrote a new will just before he left. I wonder if he had any warning. He left this with me, his last will and testament. "My beloved ones, without your knowledge, "I have lived with death a long time now "so that its coming, when it comes, "will be expected, and I will be ready for it. "Thanks to Stanton corbett, "I am not worried about your financial security. "We have our home, "and you will have a life income. "But I am concerned about the new burdens "that you will have to bear without me. "Perhaps I can lighten that burden for you. "I want to, because you have both given to me "all the joys I believe possible "for one man to have on earth. "And perhaps these thoughts "will ease your heartaches now. "If one of US had to go, "who carries the greater burden? "The one now at peace, or the ones left behind? "Isn't it better that I go first, as I know I must? "Would you have wished that I carry the burden "you now must bear? "I don't think so. "If I had lost either of you, "I couldn't have lived. "I do not believe in the barbarism of funerals, "and so I ask simply this -- "that my ashes be borne to the center "of the most beautiful spot in the world -- "our lake atitlán. "And there disposed of by the people of this land, "who have given US so much in friendship and loyalty. "And thus, when you think of me, "you will think of me in beauty as, my beloveds, I will forever think of you." Susan. If I'm going to be his godmother, the least you can do is let me carry him into his home. Wells: I'll start getting the luggage in you get used to the changes mother's made in your mansion. It's our Christmas present to you. If you don't like any part of it, you tear it all up and put it back the way it was. I thought we'd skip Christmas this year. Mrs. Corbett: The tree's not for you, dear, it's for the baby. Maybe his godmother's rushing things a little bit with that bike. Now, the new bedroom. I don't think there's a more thoughtful friend on earth. Well, you're starting out a brand-new life. Things should look different. Next! Now, I consider this my triumph. I knew you'd want to have your baby next to you, Leah. Where's Susan's room? Oh, susie's room? Follow me. [ Music-box music plays ] That's quite a trick. [ Music continues ] [ Gurgling ] This may be the best surprise after all. You're a big girl now, and you ought to have your own apartment. And here it is. [ Baby whines ] Mr. Corbett: I married a miracle woman, didn't I? Leah: I think we're both overwhelmed, aren't we, Susan? Yes. Yes, you--you -- you've thought of everything. I picked the records for the hi-fi, and this is your "welcome home" theme. [ Slow music plays ] Mr. Corbett: Well, I suggest that we let the girls get a rest now. We're all family now. We belong to you, and you belong to US. [ Baby gurgles ] They didn't mean to hurt you, putting you out here. Maybe it's even god's way of helping you get used to the idea... That he's no longer yours. There you are. Doesn't that feel better? You're tired, aren't you? Let's lie down. Come on, let's lie down. They're taking him from me! Everybody is taking my baby from me! Even you, just pushing me away! I can't take this anymore, I want to take my son and go someplace where nobody knows me! This is your home -- the home your father earned for US with his life and where rogie can grow up and accept his manhood and bear your father's name with pride. As your son?! Yes, as my son! You can't run away and hide. We have to build a life for rogie and for US here, where he can accept his heritage. As my son he can do that. And as yours he cannot. Oh. Forgive me, Susan, if I seem to be taking your son from you. Why don't you take a long walk and think it over? There is no other way. It's the only way. Remember? And give chulo a homecoming kiss. [ Telephone ringing ] Hello? What's that? Have we got a horse named what? Donna? Oh, yeah, we got a horse named Donna. You want me to bring her to the phone? Ha ha! Yeah, okay. [ Horses whinnying ] Well, hey, now, miss Susan! Welcome back! Hello, slim. Thought I'd see if hoyt and chulo are around to say hello. Well, they're both gone. Chulo for a long time -- sold. But hoyt will be back any minute now. He wrote he was exercising him. Uh-oh. Well, I guess I put my foot in it, then. Where is chulo? Where is he? Well, this rancher bought him up north. I don't rightly remember his name, but I've got it wrote down somewhere inside. Do you want me to go get it? Please. Okay. [ Car approaches ] I just heard yesterday that you were coming home. I couldn't believe it about your father. I'm sorry, Susan. I just heard about chulo. Why didn't you write me, hoyt? I wanted to buy him back before you got home. I was just waiting to sell a few stories. You just got back too quick. [ Horse whinnies ] Oh, chulo! Oh, chulo! I never owned a horse of my own. I figured it was about time. You're back, I was hoping you'd want to ride him every day. I do want to. Thank you, hoyt. [ Crying ] Su-Susan, please don't. Well, i--i can't seem to stop lately. We all have to let go sometimes. You've been through a lot. Just put all of that behind you. How'd you like me to saddle up your old boyfriend? We're both glad you're back. Thank you. [ Gurgling ] Rogie, no! No, no! N-o! Bad! No! [ Crying ] No, no! No, no! No, you mustn't play with that. No, no. It's very bad. [ Footsteps running ] I swear, this child's getting old enough to get into everything. I went into the other room to make a telephone call, and look what I found him playing with when I got back. He was even trying to snap it. Well, I guess that's how we all learn. Monkey see, monkey do. Yes, sweetheart. Man: Hey, hoyt. What am I indebted to this Joe, or are you just slumming? I've got a couple of corbett horses. I was told to bring them here for stabling. Corbett horses? Stanton corbett? No. Wells. [ Car horn honks ] Wells has been following me here. Think you can handle a couple of real horses? Did you get an okay from papa? The horses are mine. The gelding is supresti, and the mare is gordina, his little sister. You like their look, Susan? Oh, yes, they're beautiful. What did you bring them here for? I thought you hated my guts. Because I'm giving the mare to Susan for a Christmas present. Any objections? No, i--i--i couldn't. Why not? My mother -- oh, now, now, yes, she would. I've already called her. She thinks it's a marvelous idea. So, you'll be doing Susan a favor, not me. But there are two horses. Who's the second favor for? The horses have never been separated, hoyt. I thought they'd best be stalled together. Of course, if you haven't got room, I can take them back to pebble beach, and Susan can come there and ride. I simply thought it would be easier for her here, being closer to home. I'll make room. Wells, I really don't know what to say. Well, you could think of something on the way home. Let me take you. Alright. Hoyt, thank you. I'll see you tomorrow. [ Typewriter clicks ] I--i c-couldn't sleep. I wanted to see you, t-to explain something. I'll--I'll always love chulo best, hoyt. Nothing can really take his place, not ever. But you'll ride the corbett mare? You didn't have to get up in the middle of the night just to tell me that. I wanted to feel you'd understand. I don't want you to be hurt. Why should I be hurt? Because I'm hurt, too. Because Wells gave you a registered mare for Christmas? No. Because it makes me feel d-disloyal t-to chulo. Maybe you've outgrown chulo. He's pretty, but he lacks the fine manners of the corbett mare. And I've forgotten mine for letting you stand there. Sit down. I have no fine manners, either. You'll pick them up soon enough with Wells courting you. It's not that way! What way is it do you think I'm blind I know, when the corbetts give, they expect something in return? That's unfair! You're still harboring a grudge against all corbetts. Maybe they've got their side of the story, too. You're getting the corbett viewpoint down pat, aren't you? You're willing enough to board their horses, aren't you? Well, if you feel so strongly about them, you can refuse, you know. You're darned right, I could. Why didn't I? Why didn't I knock his aristocratic teeth down his royal throat and tell him to beat it with his horse? Because that's what he wanted me to do. Then he'd win, and I'd never see you. And against everything on earth, that's what I want most -- seeing you. That's why I ate dirt. That's why you bought chulo back. That's why I can't hurt you, hoyt, ever. Do you know why I didn't give you chulo right off? Because I was guilty of what I said about him. He was a bribe to make sure you'd come here. But my--my conscience wouldn't let me go all the way and tie you to me. I wanted to. I'm sorry I yelled at you. Do you ever realize that when you yell at somebody, even someone you love deeply, that you're not criticizing them -- you're really criticizing yourself for your own feelings? That's why when people love each other, they can yell at each other. We were yelling pretty loud back there. Even louder than my bab-- my baby brother. I have no right to say this, Susan. I know my hopes are based on old dreams, and I can't just ask a person to share a dream. But I want to know where I stand. I love you, darling. Is there any reason why I can't hope? I see. Is there any reason I can't at least kiss you a merry Christmas? My love will never hurt you, Susan. I promise. Don't ever ask me to stop loving you. I can't. Come on, I'll see you home. You know, I don't think Stanton needs me anymore, now that the house is electrified. Ha ha ha ha ha. Remember when they used to call it "popping the question"? That's why Wells took her riding this morning. He asked our permission to pop it at breakfast. Of course, I said yes. I hope susie does, too. Please, please don't ask me, Wells. Marriage is something I just can't think about yet. Well, I want you to think about it, Susan. You know we all love you. Now, why do you put it that way? What if no one loved me, Wells, but you? What then? I'd love you enough to make up for everybody else. Now, why? Would you go against your folks for someone you loved? Susan, how can I face a problem that will never exist? My folks love you, and I love you. What's most important is do you love me -- at all? Not enough. I can make you love me enough if you'll give me the chance. Unless there's something drastically wrong with me. The trouble is not with you, Wells, it is with me! It's what I've dreamed of, Susan, and prayed for. It would make everything right. Right? I can't marry Wells. I can't marry anyone. How could I? Why not? You think all girls who marry are virginal? Well, at least if they aren't, they can tell their husbands. I can't even do that. Not all of them do. Well, I'm not made that way. I can hardly walk down an aisle with Wells with a somewhat soiled gown. Isn't that what it's supposed to stand for? Purity? Well, let's face it, I'm not. You've got to get over this idea that your one mistake denies you all happiness, that you have to pay for it the rest of your life. Mother, here sits rogie, and nothing can ever undo that. Hey! You want that? You want it? [ Gurgling ] Is there any cleaner smell on earth than a baby after a bath? I don't think so. You have to kiss him right on the cheek 'cause that's the softest part. Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho. Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho. Ready for bed, hmm? Beddy-bye. How about lying down? You won the first battle -- rogie's accepted now as my son. But you could lose the major battle if you insist on telling all. It couldn't help him or rogie or you or any of US. What could it do but hurt? Mother, do you think for one moment the corbetts would want me in their family if they knew? Why need they know? Because it is not fair to Wells! Wells loves you. He wants you. But I don't want him! I'd think you'd be utterly grateful that Wells makes this wonderful proposal of marriage. It's the answer to everything. Everything? Do you have any happier solution? Mother, the only man I know I could love is hoyt brecker. What can he offer you? "Nothing," he says, "except hope." Has he proposed to you? No, not exactly. But he loves me. And he's the only one that--that might possibly understand all this. He's the only one I can bare my heart to. And if you did tell him all and move into the stable with him, what could you do for your little brother, if he became, instead, your illegitimate son, and everybody knew? Do you really have a choice? Oh, think, darling. [ Rogie cries ] Go to your party, mother. I will think with all my heart. Da-da. You're supposed to be sleeping now. Come on. Da-da da-da. Da-da. Da-da. * tiny boy * * child of mine * [ gurgling ] * mommy's singing * * sleepy song * * in your dreams * * little boy * [ coos ] * god is smiling down * * on you * * when you wake feel the sun * * hear the birdies sing to you * * when you wake, little son...* Little son. I can only say that when you're sleeping, you know. [ Doorbell rings ] Well, hi! Susan, I just drove down from San Francisco. Who do you think I saw? Must have been somebody important. The mcfarley and hoss man from New York -- they flew out to see me. They've accepted my book. Oh, I'm so happy for you. Come on in. Tell me all about it. It's because of you, I could do it. It's because of you, I had to do it. That's why I've busted every speed record to get to you, to tell you. This is our beginning. I know it's just a beginning. I'm not trying to back you into a corner and--and demand answers right here and now. All the way down here, I was trying to think of all the right things to say, and I can't think of anything. Just let me know I have a chance. Remember that day way back -- you told me they were going to put up a sign in monterey that said "John steinbeck and Robert Louis Stevenson and hoyt brecker wrote here"? Well, I'm gonna make that come true. I'm gonna make the name "brecker" one that people can be proud of around here. Do you mind if I dedicate this first book to my father? Then I'll dedicate every other one to you. They'll all say, "to Susan, with gratitude and everlasting love." Hoyt, you don't know me. I think you--you love somebody you've built up in your mind. I'm not really all you think I am. I haven't built up anything. I've watched the unfolding for almost two years of what I always knew was there. And what I see is beautiful. Hoyt, try to understand this -- my love would only hurt you. I'm going to marry Wells corbett. Well, don't look at me like that. You should've known. Wells -- I'm sorry. I know he's in love with you, but I'm also totally sure you're not in love with him. Why, Susan, why? Let me hear you say you love Wells corbett. Say it. Because if you marry him for any other reason than loving him, you've destroyed every belief I've ever had. Say it. [ Rogie screaming ] Rogie!! [ Rogie crying ] Woman: Dr. Fayne, emergency. Dr. Fayne, emergency. Hoyt: This is an emergency. Could I have the corbett residence? What happened? Rogie got to the lighter. [ Crying ] He caught on fire. There, there. Is Dr. Fayne with him? Yes. Well, then he's in good hands. You'll... Dear god, please. Dr. Fayne: It was a very close call, Mrs. Slade. I won't minimize the danger. But with the child's excellent health and the fine new drugs to help out, I honestly feel we can pull him through. Thank god. Fortunately, his face is scarcely touched. We have much to be thankful for, Mrs. Slade. A few seconds more... But we were given those seconds. Doctor, may I see him? I'm sorry, Susan. No. Only his mother can come in, and just for a moment. No one else, not right now. I'll send the nurse for you. Doctor... They have to let me go in. Now, you understand, mother, they have to let me go in. Honey, you heard what the doctor said. Your little brother's going to be fine. Forgive me, mother. He was nearly taken away from me, and I can't deny him anymore. Wells, you've got to know this -- rogie's not my brother. He's my child. H-H-His father was killed before we could get married, and mother's tried to protect me and the baby as best she knew how. And I can't go on pretending anymore. Not for her sake or mine or rogie's. Well, now you know, Wells. Y-You should have told me. Yes, I know. I was afraid. I've been afraid of a lot of things. Wells, t-today you asked me to marry you. You pleaded with me for an answer. Well, now you give me an answer. Give me an answer now. Oh, Susan, I... Susan: I'm sorry. Well, I guess I've hurt all of you here, and I hope you can forgive me. I--i know how wrong I've been. You must know that it's impossible for US to say how we feel, Susan. Under the circumstances, you can hardly blame Wells for not declaring himself at this moment. You have carried a great burden, my child. What you did just now took great courage. Dear, dear. I know what you did was only for Susan and because you love her. I don't think I ever would have had the courage. I think we'd better go. Mother--mother, I don't know if you can forgive me or even understand, but I had to do that. I had to. When rogie is better, we'll make new plans. And we'll do whatever you say. If you want to stay here, we'll stay here. If you want to go away with your son, then you must. You're a strong girl, Susan... And you don't need me. But remember, I love him, too. He'll always need your love. So will I. Say you understand. I do understand, and I love you both. And love is understanding. The child's mother can go to him now. Kiss him for grandma. Good night. You rest. I was afraid you'd -- I thought you'd gone. How could you believe anything could make any difference? Without you, I'm nothing. I love you, hoyt. I love you.
