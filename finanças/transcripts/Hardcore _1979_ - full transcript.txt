Just the opposite, Willem. That is the error of the Pelagians. Now, the unpardonable sin is the rejection of the Holy Spirit. Well you can talk theology, John, but I go back to the Bible. Just look at Hebrews 10:28 and 10:29 or Romans 3:23 to 25. I'm sick of watching this television stuff. - Oh, uncle Joe! - Come on. What are you doing? You know who makes it? All the kids who couldn't get along here. They go out to California and make television. I didn't like 'em when they were here, and I don't like 'em out there. Television... If you don't buy one yourself, the kids go someplace else and watch. Give the kids a break. It's Christmas. What do they sell on television? More televisions. So, now you see his grace... He hasn't changed in years. And he never will. - Aunt Ruth? - Ah-ha? Can we use Timmy for the Nativity play? We need him to play baby Jesus. But Timmy is only six months' old. Stand still.

Bless all our missionaries throughout the length and breadth of this Earth. - Amen. - Amen. Harold Jay, please don't touch that. Sister, would you go and see if Kristen has everything packed? Of course. You wanna go for coffee after we send the girls off? No, thanks anyway. I've got to get right over to the office. Anne wants to make sure you come by for dinner Sunday. What with Kristen going, you'll be all alone. - You ready, honey? - Yeah. Don't forget your gloves. Albert! Okay, bye. Baker. - Bye bye. - See you. I wish I was going to Disneyland. All that sunshine! I really need it! Daverman. DeBeer. - Bye, Dad. - Bye-bye. Deboer. DeJong. - Have a nice time, sweetie. - DeVries. Get a shot of her, will you? Wave. Come on, Marsha, get going there. DeVries! - Vanderkeen. - Bye, honey. Have a good time. Vanderlon. VanDorn. Take care of yourself, Kristen. Love you. See you later. Love you, too. Bye. - If you need anything, just call. - Okay. Van Dyke. There they go. Well... - They're safely away. - Yeah. A new shipment came in, huh? Looks good. Good. Line 2, please. Ernie Ford, line 2. Does this look all right to you? - Those the right specs? - I think so. - Yeah. Looks fine. - Okay. Thank you. This all the display space we could get? I tried to get more, but this is the limit. - The DeVries line has the same area. - Hmm. What do you think of that shade of blue, Mary? I like it, Mr. VanDorn. Don't think it's a little, erm... bright? Not really, but if you want me to tone it down... Oh, no. I wouldn't hire a display designer if I didn't trust her taste. Maybe we could bring more of that shade in? Perhaps a panel, huh? No, that would be much too overpowering. 'Overpowering.' That's the word I was looking for. Mr. VanDorn, I've worked on this colour scheme for weeks. I think it's just right. - What do you call that shade? - Pavonine. It's the same shade as the fabric. Mm-hmm. You still going with that fellow that teaches over at Grand Valley? Sam? Yeah. Nice guy. You don't lose him. Maybe we could take it down a little bit. It's just a little, erm... Overpowering? Yeah. Okay, Mr. VanDorn, I think we could knock that pavonine blue a bit. Are you sure it's all right? Yes. I think it'll look better. If you say so. This is so boring. I can't wait till tomorrow. Are you going to Knot's Berry Farm with him? He asked me. Are you going with anybody? I don't know. Do you know how to play chicken? Uh-uh. What's that? - You don't know how to play? - Uh-uh. Well, you see, a boy goes like this. What does it do? Each time he comes in closer... and closer... and closer, till you say "chicken". Then, he stops. Does Jerry do that? Everybody, it's time for your discussion group. Kristen, Marsha, put your name tags back on. Come on. Question: What is your only comfort in life and death? Answer: That I, body and soul, both in life and death, am not my own, but belong unto my faithful saviour, Jesus Christ. ♪ Praise God from whom all blessings flow ♪ Praise Him, all creatures here below ♪ Praise him above, ye heavenly host ♪ Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost ♪ Amen ♪ As soon as the church service begins the ushers all go over to Big Boy's for coffee. I'll get it. So, when someone like old Mrs. Van Dyke in a wheelchair needs help, there's no one here to help her. She's right. You can never find those guys when you need them. Aren't you glad you came for Sunday dinner now? - It's for you, Jake. - Thank you. Well, I hope I never get old and have to be in a wheelchair, and have to depend on the ushers to help me out of church. You'd never let that happen to your mother, would you, Harold Jay? When? Yes, all right. All right. Thank you. You want some gravy? What is it, Jake? That was Mrs. Steensma, calling from California. Kristen's disappeared. What happened? They don't know. They were on some sort of recreation deal at Knot's Berry farm. When they came back to the bus, Kristen was gone and they couldn't find her. - Have they called the police? - Yeah. Is Marsha there? Yeah, she's all right. She's upset. I'm going to fly out there today. They want me to bring some pictures. I'll go with you. I'll check the airline schedules, and... Just... Er, let me pack some things. There's a ride called the Great White Knuckler. A roller coaster. The last time I saw Kristen, she was standing there. Why was she alone? Was she alone? I told the policeman. They had met an older boy earlier. Well, Mr. VanDorn, turns out that the boy your daughter was talking to didn't work at the park. We've interviewed everybody there and nobody there had ever seen him before. But if she has... At the present, there's no indication of any violence. Let's hope she's just a runaway. There's something very wrong here. Kristen isn't the type of person to just up and leave. I said, let's hope she's a runaway. See, if she's a runaway, then at least she knows where she is. And that's better than a lot of these other kids. Some of them won't show up for years, and some won't show up at all. These are the realities, Mr. VanDorn. What are you doing? I've got two officers assigned to the case. They're going to follow up every lead. We're going to give it our best shot. What can we do? There are people who specialise in this kind of thing. I suppose you could hire yourselves the best private detective in town. He might be able to put all his energies into finding Kristen. Mr. Mast, I'm Jake VanDorn. This is my brother-in-law, Wesley. - Coffee? - Black. Thank you. Thanks. Let me ask you a personal question. Was your daughter the kind of girl to run around? Play practical jokes, maybe? No, I didn't think she was. Well, erm... Let me, er... Let me get the picture here. Let me guess. Let me, er, visualise your daughter. She's an absolutely clean girl, a model daughter. She never had a rebellious or impure thought. She didn't fuck around. If I were you, I'd watch my language, Mr. Mast. I'm a private detective, VanDorn. You want to hire a choir boy, you can go back to Grand Rapids. I've been to that scumbag town. It's full of them. Who's paying you? You are. That's right. Look, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to offend your personal beliefs. Believe me, I'm a practitioner of Mind Science, myself. Look, I'm good at this. I do it a lot. Don't worry, I'll find her. No problem. It may take a week or two, maybe a month, at most. I get $750 a week, minimum. It may seem like a lot to you, but it ain't. You could hire cheaper. And better? I suppose. But I got an instinct. If your daughter's here, I'll track her down. There's not much you can do here. Maybe it'd be better if you go back home. You could look through Kristen's personal stuff. Ask around. Maybe find out if she knew somebody out here. A friend or relative. Maybe somebody she knew knew somebody out here. Jake. - Where's Marsha? - Marsha. - How about some cake and coffee? - Just coffee, thank you. Hello, Uncle Jake. Sorry I didn't make it yesterday. But here's your present, a day late. I hope you like it. - Thank you. - Happy birthday. Thanks. - What is it? - Well, you'll see. - I'll just go out on the porch. - Okay, Jake. What is it, honey? Hello, Jake. - Here, sit here. - No, thanks. I'll sit over there. Spring's going to be early. A cold spring means a hot summer. It's going to be a good year. How's your business, Jake? Not too bad. You know, you should come around more often. We haven't seen you for weeks. Anne complains she doesn't see you at all anymore. Jake, you... You can't dwell on Kristen all the time. Sometimes it's hard for us to understand the Lord's ways. He's testing you. You have to have faith. Would you? Could you? - Yes, hello. - Mr. VanDorn. - Mast? - Yeah. Where are you? The connection sounds very good. - I'm back in Grand Rapids. - G.R.? Why? Can you meet me in about an hour? At the Pantlind Hotel. - I have a meeting. - What are you paying me for? I'll be there. Have you ever seen any pornographic movies, Jake? No. Do you know what a hardcore movie is? - Yes, it's like a stag film, huh? - Yeah. - Have you ever seen one of those? - No. - They're legal now, all over. - So I gather. Even here in Grand Rapids. There's a little, er, stall theatre up here. It's closed now, but I got the use of it for an hour. It's something you oughta see. It can't be. Oh, my God. Turn it off. Turn it off. Turn it off! Turn it off!! Oh, God. Turn it off, please. - Where is she? - I don't know. Where did you get that film? I bought it in a store in L.A. I gotta keep it. - Who made it? - I don't know. - What do you mean? - Wait a minute. Slow down. A film like this, 8mm film, it costs $200 or $300 to make. Sold outright in a store. Shown in peep machines. It's impossible to track down. Nobody makes it. Nobody shows it. Nobody sees it. It's like it doesn't even exist. What's it called? It was called Slave of Love when I bought it. Next time it's sold, it'll be called something else. - But the police. - The police? You know more than the police do. You think she's all right? Yeah, probably. You like this, don't you? You liked showing me this. I hate it. But you got to know, buddy, there's a lot of strange things happen in this world. Things you don't know about in Grand Rapids. Things you don't wanna to know about. Doors that shouldn't be opened. Look, I'll find her. But, er, I can't make any promises. I don't know what she'll be like when I find her. And when I find her, you may not even want her back. Yeah... Actors, to your positions, please. Come on, Niki, put your wig back on. Let's get it on. Yeah, get it together, kids. Hey, can't you get this, er, bed any warmer? My ass is freezing. He's got it up. It's about time. - Kid's got a big schlong. - A great talent. Action! Move it, let's go. The wallpaper, it's peeling. - Never mind. Keep shooting. - We're rolling. Come on. Keep it up, keep it going. All right. Niki, throw your legs around his shoulders. Cologne? Bennie, swing around this way. Yeah, now lick her belly. Maybe we should use a strobe light. So it looks like they're doing more than they are. Keep licking'. Well, for what we're payin' 'em, they'll do whatever we want. - Keep lickin'. - Quick, get some spunk, Klaus. Niki, come on, sweetheart. Now, you're lying back. You're feeling real good. You're setting your mind free, you're thinking about your dad. Your mind is open, it's just... - The kid's a good director. - U.C.L.A. Bennie, come on now. Niki... - Move a little bit more to your right. - That's good. To your left. They can go all night. Shut the fuck up. Hey, Hophead. What do you know? What do you hear? What do you say? Don't get uppity with me, Billy. I remember when you was running a car wash. You couldn't make a go of that, could you? What was the other thing? The Dairy Queen? That went busted, too, didn't it? Always in action, though, and always made a dollar. - Right, Kurt? - Right. Always in action. This girl, here, she's been doing some porn stuff. - You recognise her? - No. Look again, Billy boy, this is jailbait. It could get you in a lot of trouble. That's no, twice. All right. I may have to go to the authorities. You want to listen to me, Andy. You play with yourself? You must play with yourself. Would I bother with shit like that? Look at my girls. They're beautiful. I'm a father to these girls. With the money I'm makin', do I have to bother with that shit? - You know who's in there now? - Who? - Terry. The beauty. - Right. The fire dancer. - Very hot. - Right. She'll grow hair on your head. Do you want to hang around? But you'd gotta be quiet. Don't make a sound. That's really Terry? Move over a little bit. Back up a little bit and wrap yourself around him. Okay, cut! I'm going out of town for a while. No, I don't know when I'll be back. No, there's nothing wrong. Think you can keep things running? Don't ask. There's a vibe. It's really there. Definitely. - There's a real vibe. - Yeah, really. Feels like I could share a lot of things with you. - And I try to be giving. - I love the apartment. Yeah, well I did it myself, you know. Shit, it's the cops. Who the fuck is that? What are you doing? You son of a bitch! I've been paying you every week for four months. You've been out here... I'm splitting. I ain't cheated you, Pilgrim. This is research, damn it. That girl could have told us something. Research? I suppose these are the extra expenses I've been paying you for. Why the fuck don't you stay where you belong, back in yo-yo land. Get out of here. Hey, I'm only human, you know. I'm not perfect. Get out. This is my own apartment. Get out. All right, you rat prick. Go find your own daughter. I'm not smart enough to lock my own fucking door. Hey. Hey. Fifty cent admission. It's a fifty cents admission. It's applicable to a purchase. Have you got a film called Slave of Love? What we got is just these here, what you see. It's a short film. They're all about the same. Would you like something? - This is the movie I'm talking about. - I don't know what you're talking about. I just wondered if you'd ever seen this film of this woman right here. That girl? No, I never seen her. I don't know anybody. Look, I'm trying to find... - Who owns this store? - I don't know. Look, man, if you're looking for somebody, maybe you oughtta check the Yellow Pages. - Wait a minute. - I don't know nothing, man. You don't want anything for your fifty cents? Here, take your fifty cents back. - No, that's all right. - No, take it. I don't want your goddamn fifty cents. Free information, sir. Want companionship? Want some friendship? Free information. Right in here, sir. They'll treat you well. Free information. Hello. Welcome to Wild Mary's. I'm Beatrice. - Have you been here before? - No. What we offer here is nude, body-to-body contact on a bed in a private room. It's $20 a half-hour, $30 an hour. Anything else you may desire may be discussed in the privacy of your room. Tipping's allowed. We accept BankAmericard, MasterCharge, American Express. I don't think I want, erm, body-to-body contact. Well, you can discuss that in your private room with the lady of your choice. Hi. I'm looking for a girl. Have you ever been in a porno film? Why don't you come back with me? I'm sure you'll find what you like. - Hello. - Hola. - You want a session? - No, I don't think so. Are you sure? We have regular sessions, too. It's only $20. Oh, sí, Señor. Sexo, sí. Sí, Señor. Sexo, sí. Want to see what we got? See you later, Felice. - You ever been here before? - No. What we offer is female wrestling.

Yeah, well, you can do that in the privacy of your room. Okay, I'll take a half-hour. Any particular choice of girl? You'll do fine. Just follow me. Why don't you just wait in here? I got to get a sheet. - Still dressed? - Yeah, well, I want to, erm... Why don't you just relax, huh? Make yourself comfortable. Have a seat. My name's Felice. There's this girl that I wanted to ask you about. You're not a Vice are ya? Do you work for the Los Angeles Police Department, or do you have any affiliation with law enforcement agencies? No, I don't. I have to ask you that. If you were a Vice, you couldn't deny it. You know, you shouldn't dress so straight. You wouldn't get hassled so much. Here, let me help you get this tie off. Actually, I wanna talk to you about this girl. I have her picture right here. Pull out your cock. What? Cops aren't allowed to do that, either. A judge ruled that that was entrapment. No, Felice, I'm not a cop. Matter of fact, right now I have less respect for the police than you do. I'm trying to find this girl. She's a runaway. I can't seem to get anybody to help me. - Are you going to stiff me? - What do you mean? Look... That $20 you just paid to get in here? I don't get any of that. That goes to the guys that own this place. I get $2 an hour, plus 10% of that goes to a bail fund. I make all my money on tips. - You want a tip? - Sure I want a tip. What do you want? Tips can be what? Anywhere from, like, $30 to $70. - What do you mean? - What do you want to tip me for? Got to spell it out, man. Just tell me what you want. Just relax. Here, I'll give you a tip. Here's $40. Now, what do you want? - I want to talk to you. - Yeah, that's cool. About this woman. I'm looking for her. I want to know if you know her! Man, I told you, I don't know nobody. I never seen her before. I'm getting angry. Wait a minute, man. That will cost you more than $40. - I'm going to find some answers. - Man, just wait a minute. Who runs this place? Is it that blonde guy out there? Is that who it is? I'm going to talk to somebody. Where's the bastard that runs this shit hole? - What's the problem? - He's causing trouble. I want you to help me find this woman! I've been asking everybody! Nobody knows anything! Just cool it. Listen, we don't want the cops in here. You got a family? I suppose you haven't seen her, either! Her name is Kristen! I suppose you've never seen her, right? Shut up! Knock it off! Are those the numbers on Bang the Nun Slowly? - No, these are for Proud Pussy. - Right, read. - They're very good. - Just read. Right. - Houston is $74,000. - Yeah, go ahead. Dallas is $160,000. - Dallas is what? - $160,000. That's a nice number. Better than the Leeway Brothers. They only pulled $30,000. Who the fuck told you to mention the Leeway Brothers? - They made Love Muscle. - Here's your love muscle. They made it with Suzie Stretchmark in a delivery room. Remember this, I make pictures of quality. I make custard! You understand what I mean? I use custard. Little chicks that come off the surfboard. You can take them and dunk them. You can pull them in and out. Quality, that's the answer. - What'd we do in St. Louis? - St. Louis, $38,000. St. Louis can bang this slowly. Who booked St. Louis? Hi, I'm Jake DeVries. I'm here to see Mr. Ramada. Just a moment. - Where's my accountant? - He's got a bad stomach. He's got a bad stomach? Hello. What is it, Georgia? There's a Mr. DeVries here to see you. A Mr. DeVries. I don't know a... You know a DeVries? - I never heard of him. - You ask where he's from. - Detroit. What'd we do in Detroit? - Detroit? Big. $200,000. Send him in, Georgia. You never can tell. Who the fuck knows? Detroit. $200,000. - You never can tell. He may own drive-ins. - Right. - You feeling okay? - I told you never to ask me how I feel. Didn't I tell you that? All you're s'posed to do is say "right". - Say "right". - Right. That's it. "Right." That's all you're supposed to say. Mr DeVries. Hello, how are you? I'm Bill Ramada, and this is Kurt. - Kurt. - How do you do? Sit down, Detroit. I love Detroit. Had an all-time box office smash there, Little Oral Annie. Did you see it? No, I'm afraid I missed it. Oh, you missed a good one. Girl's gonna be a big star, right? Right. Big star. That's my "right" man. What can I do for you, Mr. DeVries? Call me Jake. All right, Jake, what can I do for you? I'm interested in financing an adult feature film, and I was told you were the man to see. You came to the right man. Continue. Go ahead. I have $50,000 that I'm prepared to invest in a suitable project. Now, of course, I may want to get involved in the process of making the film. You know, I might want to meet some of the people who make this kind of film, and learn how it's done. I'm curious, Jake. What business are you in? I have my own business. We make rivets for the auto industry. We sell to Fisher Body. Rivets? That sounds like a good, solid American business. Right, Kurt? - Right. - Sit down, will you? Why does a solid American businessman like you want to get into pornography? Well, I'll tell you, Bill. Is it all right if I call you Bill? Yeah, you can call me Bill. Go ahead. I'll be frank with you, Bill. I've made a lot of money, but... Well, even rivets can get a little boring after a while. So, when my business manager suggested that I tax-shelter some income... I thought I'd give this a try. - What, the rivet hit you in the eye? - Detroit's a tough town. Jake, it's cool, you don't have to bullshit me. You're looking to lay some pipe, right? Get fucked? Humped? Banged? Not exactly. Your $50,000 buys you a lot of pussy, you know. You can get yourself pussy-whipped for that kind of money. What do you want to fuck with the movie business for? - It's an investment. - It's an investment, huh? Don't get me wrong. A couple of years ago, I woulda jumped at your 50 big ones. But, listen to this: Kurt, what did we do on High School Honeys last year? Five, three. Five, three. That's $5,300,000. Does that sound like I need a partner? I don't take partners. Right, Kurt? But I'll give you some advice. You look like a nice guy. You want to take some advice from me? Start small. Start with the kiddie porn. Then work yourself up. And you come around the set. I'll see if somebody wants your $50,000, and you can get into business. - I appreciate that, Bill. - You appreciate it? Okay, but right now, I got to go. I'm a hypoglycemic, my sugar runs low every two hours. So I got to eat something. Listen Jake, don't forget my door is always open to artistic people. Listen Kurt, I want you to get me a hamburger, lean, and some dry toast. "W/M, 35, 175. "Fastest tongue in West. "Will demonstrate proficiency in all dialects... "to females under 50.

Boy, us military get... special treatment! This is where we come in for the close-up. What's happening here, Jake? How did you find me? I called every L.A. hotel. Holiday Inn gave this as a referral number. Your office said you didn't have any business in New York. So I figured you had come out here. Wesley, do me a favour, will you? What? Leave me alone. Go home. Go away. - Jake, I can't... - Do what I say, please. What is going on, Jake? I have an idea of how to find Kristen. I have a plan, but I have to be alone. Well, what'll I tell the others? We... We care about you. Tell them anything you want. Tell them I'm on vacation. Tell them I'm on a business trip. Just don't tell them about this, that's all. Go home. Go away.

Then, I'm the man for you. I'm glad to meet you, but I'm afraid you're not the type we're looking for. You mean because I'm black? No, you're just not the type. What do you mean, "Not the type"? Man, don't you know who I am? I'm Big Dick Blaque. I've done more porno movies than you ever saw! I've worked with Harry Reems, Johnny Wadd. "Not the type"? I can cum ten times a day. I can keep it hard for two hours at a time. I'm a woman's dream. I got a dick hung on me nine inches long! I'm sorry, Mr. Blaque, I'm sure you're very good. But, at the moment, I just don't have anything for you. If something comes up, I'll be happy to give you a call. Oh, shit. You don't wanna hire any niggers, that's all. I knew this was a scam. This is bullshit! Well, I'm sorry, but I'm afraid you're not exactly the type. We have something a little different in mind. Don't you wanna see my stuff, man? What stuff? You know, my, er... stuff. Yeah, sure. All right, thank you very much. Yes, come in. Hey, man, what's happening? We're casting an explicit sex action feature. I know. Word's out on the street. Word's also out that you ain't really hiring anybody. Well, that's not true, er, Mr... Jim Sloan. Sometimes they call me Jism Jim. That's not true, Jim. Oh. As a matter of fact... I think you're very close to the type we've been looking for. Oh, yeah? Well, er... I've done a lot of good work, you know, er... Shorts, features. No major roles yet, it's true, but, er, it's all been really good stuff. That's what I want to talk to you about. I've seen some of your stuff. I like your looks. I particularly liked you in this film. Oh yeah, I remember that. It was made by some college kids. It was called Slave of Love? God, I don't know what it was called. I never even saw it. I only get 25 bucks for the whole goddamn thing. Well, I liked you. I also liked the girl. Really thought she was good. I was wondering, erm, - Is she still around? Still working? - Just wait a minute. I need the work, and I wanna be in your picture, but that is one bitch that I will not work with again! That was one freaky bitch, man. I don't know what she was into, I don't know what she was on. I just don't want anything to do with her again, okay? You know what she did to me? My prick was so red, and sore, and chewed out, I couldn't walk for a goddamn week. Look at you... Cheer up, you're not dead. Come on, sit up, trash. We're gonna take a little shower together. Okay, stop it! Don't hit me any more. Where's the girl? Where is she? This guy worked her. His name is Tod! Where does he hang out? I don't know, man. I don't know. Where? Look, I know this chick named Niki. She works at Les Girls. She would know. She knows where he lives, honest. Is there girl here named Niki? In one of the booths. Any one of the first three. Hey, that'll be $5 for two minutes. It's $5 a token. I'll take two. Hello. Are you Niki? Sure, like in Mikey and Nicky. Did you see that picture? No. Too bad. I wasn't in it. Well, it's your money. You talk. I'm making a film. Jim Sloan is in it. And he thought you might know where Tod is. Hey, don't I know you? Weren't you on the set the other night with Ramada? Yeah. You making a feature? Uh-huh. Live sound. You got any parts? I'm free. I don't really do this. Jim and I are trying to run down this girl. Do you know her? I can't see shit without my glasses. Joanne? - You know her? - No. I seen her with Tod. - Do you know where she lives? - No. Do you know where she might be found? Where is she? - Well, Tod might know. - Where is he? The last I heard, he went to San Diego. If we went down there, do you think you'd be able to find him? You're not a film producer, are you? How much you make a week, Niki? You a private detective? Something like that. How much you make? Here? What a joke. There was some other detective asking about that girl. $300? This is just temporary. I once made $900 in outcall. I'll give you $700 a week, cash, if you'll help me find this girl. Up front? Half now, half later. Make it $900. That was my best week. Okay. My client pays for it, anyway. Well, when do we start? Tonight. When you get outta here we'll go. Erm, Mr. Mast? Er, I'm Wes DeJong, Jake VanDorn's brother-in-law. We met out here a couple of months ago, when he hired you. Your agency said you might be here. Ssshh. I'm on a stakeout. I'm staking out this beer bottle. I'm worried about Jake. Look, I'm off that case. He fired me. I want to rehire you. I also want you to protect my brother-in-law. He's an angry, unhappy man. Yeah, unhappy. You can see that. I'm very sensitive to people's psychology. $750 a week, plus travel expenses. Have you actually paid for both these rooms? I thought you were just going to get a receipt for two, and kickback the deskman. You going somewhere? I thought you were going to bed. I am. Hey, you have any pills? Any Valium or Librium? Do you know pimps will sell Valium for 50 cents apiece? Can you believe that? I think I'm really fucked up. I'm a Venusian. Huh? A Venusian. The Venusian Church. You know, Venus, goddess of love. ♪ Venus, goddess of love. ♪ No. Huh? Take it easy, Niki. Calm down. We'll have a little talk, and then... you'll go to your room, and we'll both get a good night's sleep. You got anything to drink? Want to go out and get something? I don't drink, but you can go out if you want to. You don't drink? Ulcers. You're not a private detective, either, are you? No. I didn't think so. I've fucked detectives. Who are you? - A friend. - Joanne's? Yeah. I'm her father. Jesus. Her name's Kristen. She disappeared a couple of months ago. Well, where's your wife? She's dead. Hey, look, don't worry about it. Your daughter's around. We'll find her in a couple of days. You know what your problem is? You think negatively. You're a very negative person. I mean, you gotta believe in something. What do they believe in the, er... What church? Dutch Reformation. It's a Calvinist denomination. Do they believe in reincarnation? I believe in reincarnation. They believe in the TULIP. What the crap? It's an acronym. It comes from the Canons of Dort. Every letter stands for different beliefs like, er... Are you sure you want to hear this? Yeah, yeah. Please, go on. I'm a Venusian, myself. Well, 'T' stands for Total Depravity. All men, through original sin, are totally evil and incapable of good. "All my works are as filthy rags in the sight of the Lord." That's what the Venusians call negative moral attitudes. Well, be that as it may, erm... 'U' stands for Unconditional Election. God has chosen a certain number of people to be saved, the elect, and he's chosen them from the beginning of time. 'L' is for Limited Atonement. Only a limited number of people will be atoned, and go to Heaven. 'I' is for Irresistible Grace. God's grace cannot be resisted or denied. And 'P' is for the Perseverance of the Saints. Once you're in grace, you cannot fall from the numbers of the elect. And that's it, the TULIP. Before you can become saved, God already knows who you are? Oh yes, he'd have to. That's predestination. I mean, er... If God is omniscient, if he knows everything, and he wouldn't be God if he didn't, then he must have known, even before the creation of the world, the names of those who would be saved. Well, then it's all worked out. It's fixed. More or less. And I thought I was fucked up. Well, I admit it's a little confusing when you look at it from the outside. You have to try to look at it from the inside. But if you look at anything from the inside, it makes sense. I mean, you should hear perverts talk. A guy once almost had me convinced to let his German Shepherd screw me. It's not quite the same thing. - It doesn't make any sense to me. - Flight 712 to San Diego, now boarding. I think that's our plane. Can I help you with that? Jim Rucker runs this place. He knows where everybody is. It's a nice place. He hires a lot of girls. Is Rucker here? He'll be back in a couple of hours. All right, tell him Louise was here. I'll come back later. You want anything? You shouldn't eat all that junk, anyway. It's no good for you. At least I'm a growing person. Well, you won't keep growing long at this rate. Don't start coming down on me. You know, what I do is important. There's a lot of guys who can't talk to their wives or girlfriends, and they talk to me. And I make them feel better. I'm just like a therapist. You know there's a professor at U.C.L.A. writing a book about me. What do you think I do, just suck off guys all day? You think I am just a fuck face? You can't even say it, can you? Say what? 'Sucking off.' All right. Sucking off. Now does that make me as good as you? You don't understand shit. You don't understand. When I was 15, I was turning tricks in Vegas. I was taking all the older girls' regular customers. It wasn't my fault. Then they put out a contract on me. I didn't even know it was illegal. Look, Niki, don't go on, please. You and I, we just have very different ideas about sex, that's all. Why? You a sex fiend? - No. - Well, neither am I. That's all you do. It's not all... Look, how important do you think sex is? Not very. Well, then, we're just alike. I mean, you think it's so unimportant that you don't even do it. I think it's so unimportant that I don't care who I do it with. No, we're not alike. You could never understand a person like me. I'm a mystery to you. A middle-class person. A Midwesterner. Goes to church. Believes in God. And who believes that, at the end of his life, he'll be redeemed. It doesn't make any sense to you. I don't know why I should have to justify myself to you. I don't care about the things you care about. I don't care what's happening in Los Angeles and New York. I don't care about the movies or TV. I don't care who's on Johnny Carson. Well, what do you care about? I care about my daughter. Hey, Rucker. Remember me? Louise. Rhymes with squeeze. You working in San Diego now? No, I'm still up in L.A. I was looking for Tod. I heard he was around. Was. He and that shitheel, Ratan, went down to T.J. Maybe I shouldn't say that. Anyway, I hear he's back in Frisco now. Was he with a girl? No. Okay, thanks. Keep in touch, baby. - What's T.J.? - Tijuana. - Were they here? - Tod was. - He was with Ratan. - What does that mean? What does he do? He deals in pain. Is Kristen safe? Let's get a plane to San Francisco. Apparently, your friend slipped down into San Diego. And now he's headed up to San Francisco. How's it feel to have the L.A.P.D. doing your police work for you, Andrew? You're gonna thank me for this. You know, the media loves this kinda shit. Real family drama. Runaway daughter, enraged father. They eat it up. It helps their ratings. Now if this guy goes off half-cocked and gets himself hurt... You're going to get such bad publicity, you won't believe it. You think this guy's going to get himself in trouble? He's a religious type. You figure it. Tod'll meet you at that bookstore down there at 4 o'clock tomorrow. I told him you were a specialty customer. Why can't I meet him now? Why can't I meet him now? He's busy now. Where does he live? Listen, I'm risking my ass. We'll do it my way, okay? I've been in more motel rooms this past week than I have in the rest of my life. At least it seems that way. Yeah, I know what you mean. After a while they all look the same. They are the same. Hey, er, do you live in a house, back in wherever? Grand Rapids? Of course. On your own land? Just you and your daughter? Listen, I don't know your daughter... but, er... But, what? Well... I wouldn't expect too much about her coming back. What makes you so sure? Your wife isn't dead, is she? Why do you say that? It's just a guess. She isn't dead though, is she? Where is she, now? Back East somewhere. It doesn't matter. - Does your daughter know? - Of course. Your wife left you, right? Her name was Joanne, too. How'd you know? Just a guess. What was the problem? Sex? Always is. I really don't blame you for saying that, Niki, really I don't. It's this culture, everything's based on sex. Sold on sex. Magazines, music, T.V. Buy this because of sex. Use that because of sex. Kids, they think it's normal. They think they're supposed to talk dirty, wear scanty clothes. Hey, don't get upset. I lied, too. I don't make no $500. I don't make anything. Everything I make goes to Granville. Where? Granville. My old man. Pimp to you. I split 'cause he didn't treat me for shit. He thinks he's so cool. You know, once I tried to take my clothes... This really isn't any of my business. I don't want to know about it. So, I guess we're both fucked, huh? At least you get to go to Heaven. I don't get shit. Pilgrim! This is, er, just how you found me once. What are you doing here? Look, I felt like such a shit after what I did to you, Pilgrim. Not that I did anything wrong. But I kept investigating, poking around. There's some poor S.O.B. in L.A, er... with his face all bent out of shape where you damaged his movie career. Well... It's lucky for him no-one looks at his face. - The police want to arrest me? - Nah. They don't care about some faggot hustler. They're more interested in your daughter's health, and yours. - Like I am. - Yeah, sure. Look, Pilgrim... you're way out on a limb here. You don't know what you're into. - You sure as hell haven't been any help. - Look, I'm sorry about that. Now, what have you found out? You gotta tell me. Why don't you tell me something for a change? Like what? Who's Ratan? Where did you hear that name? I just heard. Who is he? You know, you can buy anything on this earth. You can buy child whores, slaves. Have people raped and killed. One of the men who supposedly arranges such things is called Ratan. How did you hear about him? Just a name. Yeah... Don't do anything more. I'll find out what I can. - She know anything about this? - Who, the whore? Nah, she's the victim. Dime a dozen. Hey, Jake. Hey. What's happening? I hear you've got some money to spend. I hear you're interested in... - Interesting things. - Yeah. Come on. Do you work for the San Francisco Police Department, or do you have any other affiliation with any law enforcement agency? No, man. What you got in mind? I wanna meet, er... Ratan. What is that, some kinda chair? I never heard of no Ratan. Well, I'm told that there are certain things that only Ratan can provide. Are you talking about real excitement? Yeah, I heard that you and him just come back from Mexico, and... you got a picture where a girl gets, erm, you know. Who... who told you this? Rucker. Well, I don't know no Ratan, but I may be able to help you out. It's not me, you understand. It's just helping out a friend. It'll cost you $100 for a single screening. Is this the one with the girl named Kristen in it? Uh-huh. You got the money? Well... Hey, take it or leave it. Okay. Okay, er... Meet me here today, 8 o'clock. With the money. Then we'll go see the film. Good. Man, you ain't never going to have no thrill like this. What's the matter with your room? - The T.V.'s broke. - Yeah? Well, this one's broke, too. How about the bed. Is that working? Granville's looking for you, Niki. My name ain't Niki. It's Pattica, you know, like in Attica. Real nice. Granville's looking for you, anyway. Well, who's that? You know. The dude with the big white car. The guy who bought you that ring. I know that boy. He can make life real tough on a working girl. He can, er, get you strung out again. He'll get you sniffing and snorting and shooting. You both can fuck off. You're taking a big chance. I don't plan on seeing him again, anyway. Oh, no? What are you going to do, get a job? Office temporaries? Computer programmer? Cosmetologist? Jake'll take care of me. Who? VanDorn? You got to be kidding yourself, honey. You think once he finds his daughter he's going to think about you? No way, kid. You'll be strictly yesterday's papers. Niki... - What did you find out? - Just leave me alone. Look, I'm here to help you. All right. All right. Did you find out where she is? Tod disappeared. I've got to find him. Where does he live? What happened? Where is he? I can't tell you that. Listen to me, young lady. My daughter's been missing for five months. And I've gone through a lot to try to find out what's happened to her. Now, today, I saw Ratan kill a girl. Now, I am not going to let this Tod slip through my hands. Now where is he? But, then you'll forget about me. It's some bondage house. A black storefront off Kearney and Broadway. He works there. I won't forget you. What are you doing, Pilgrim? Look, where are you going? Look, let me take care of this. I don't want you to get hurt! Look, don't do anything till the police get there. Look, you got to tell me where he's gone. Hello, police? My name is Mast. Get me Joe Klein in Vice. Hello, come on in. Have a seat. - Now, you need some information? - Yeah. Well, we offer... Listen, what are you interested in? We offer verbal humiliation, bondage... I'm looking for Tod. Is he in? Tod? I don't know anyone named Tod. What girls do you have here? Well, I'm Hope. This is Faith, Charity. All you have is three girls? I think you've made a mistake. Check down the street. Different address. - I know he's here. - Wait a minute. Tod! What do you want? Hey, you didn't like the movie? Listen, I got another one. I want my daughter. Her name is Kristen, or Joanne. She was with you! I don't know what you're talking about, man. The police know about Ratan. They know he's here with you. They know everything! Oh, yeah? Well, goody for them. Get the fuck outta here! Where's Ratan? - Where is he? - Let go... - Where is he? - He's the fuck there. The El Matador. He goes there. Don't move, Ratan! Freeze, asshole! Kristen? Don't hurt me. I know it's been terrible for you, but it's over now, honey. You can come home now. It doesn't matter what they made you do. They didn't make me do anything. I wanted to leave. Oh, that's not true, baby. You didn't want to leave. They took you away. I love you. Don't touch me, you cocksucker! You never gave a fuck about me before. You didn't! So, don't touch me now. I didn't fit into your goddamned world. I wasn't pretty or good enough for you. You never approved of any of my friends. You drove them all away! I'm with people who love me now. You robbed my life. Oh God, baby, I... I do love you. I just never knew how to show you. It's very difficult for me. Nobody ever taught me. I tried. It's just my damnable pride. Just get away. Please. You really want me to go? No. Then you take me home. All right. Come on, now. Let's break it up, okay? There's nothing here to see. It's all over. Come on, now. Niki, maybe I... Maybe there's some way I can... Andy... Think maybe you could do something for her? Maybe money...? Go home, Pilgrim. There's nothing you can do.
