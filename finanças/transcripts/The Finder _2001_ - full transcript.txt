(slow, dramatic music) (puttering overhead) (slow, dramatic music) (car starts up) (puttering) - [Radio Announcer] It's that time of year again folks. Time to celebrate all the great hits of the 50s and 60s. Get your rockin' socks ready for the annual Sunrise Cove Rockin' Roll Revival Festival. (dramatic music) (muffled screaming) (slow, dramatic music) (muffled screaming) (slow, dramatic music) (banging) - All right, come. (muffled screaming) (slow, dramatic music) (muffled screaming) Yeah, yeah, come on. (woman screams) (slow, dramatic music) Hey. I got her. Yeah, well I'll get the tape done now. Yeah, give me 20 minutes. (heavy breathing) (slow, dramatic music) Do you wanna live? (ripping) Do you wanna live? All right. Hm? You will say your name, then, "I'm alive. "Follow these orders to the letter, "do not inform the police, or I will die." You got that? (slow, dramatic music) Say it. Hm? Say it. (woman breathing heavily) Say it. (woman yelps) - Hey you. Yeah, Pete McClusky, I want you to have a look at these. - Yeah let's just go in here. (phone ringing) - Les Kearney. Oh well Bob, I'm kind of busy right now. Maybe I could talk to you later, yeah? What, right now? Who gave you my number? Fine. But in case you don't know the rules, it's 350 a day, plus expenses. Staton Hotel? Done. - Hey Les, this is uh-- - Pete McClusky. - G'Day. - Life Preserver Inc. - Got this new life jacket, reckons it's a real beaut. - Oh, that's good Pete. So, um, what happens if say a victim gets uh, dragged onto rocks, aye? It comes apart. Anyway. It was nice to meet you. - What the club really needs is a new inflatable rubber boat. (slow music) - [Answering Machine] I'll call you back as soon as possible, thanks. (machine beeps) - [Michelle] Les, it's Michelle. Yeah, thanks for waking me this morning. Les, you and I really need to talk. Can you meet me around 9:30 at the Surfrider Bar? It's really important. (machine beeps) - Hello? (upbeat pop rock music) Hey, big fella. - Anyone you're looking for? Besides Sharon Stone? Nice shirt. Bloke you're looking for is about 5'10", dark suit. - So where is he? - Surfrider Bar. He owe you money or something? - My lottery win. Delivering the great, big peck. - Good. That means you can slip me that 100 you owe on last week's game. (upbeat pop rock music) - Bob Castaldi? - [Bob] Yeah. - Les Kearney. - It's good to meet you. - Ang? - Brownie? - Yep, and uh? - [Bob] Yeah. - Whatever he's having. - Sure. (upbeat pop rock music) - [Les] What can I do for you? - My daughter Rebecca's been kidnapped. - Well you should go to the police. - No way, no cops. Just hear me out, okay? - No. Kidnapping is a serious matter. The police have got specialists who are trained for this sort of thing and if you want my advice and you're serious, you'll talk to them. - Well that's why I'm here, talking to you. Lauren told me you're the specialist. - What's Lauren got to do with this? - We're just seeing each other. (upbeat pop rock music) (people chattering) The pricks'll kill her if we go to the cops. - Take a seat. (people chattering) - Look I know you two were an item, but that's in the past right? This is about my daughter, now will you help me? - The best that I can do is put you in touch with someone that I used to work with. He'll be someone that you can trust. - Look, they sent a tape and her ring. Christ, she never took it off. It was her 21st present from me. - So what time did this happen? - This morning on her way to work. On the tape she sounded really freaked out. - So you know anyone who would try this? - All I know is I've got 24 hours to pool a million bucks together, or they'll kill her. - And you got that sort of money? - I'm gonna get it together now. - You said, "They'll." That's plural. - There's gotta be more than one of them, right? - What, you know that for sure? - Of course not. Look, I'm in the construction business. Every time I make a deal, I make an enemy. (sighs) Les. If you had a daughter, you would know what I'm going through here. - I'll make some inquiries. Give me a couple of hours, what have you got? - Well there's five grand in there for starters. There's a photo of Rebecca and her work details and a tape from those bastards. You can talk to Davidson, her ex-boyfriend. His number's here, too. - [Waitress] Here's your Crown lager and there's your scotch on the rocks. - Keep the change. So uh, have you told your wife? - Mate, she is my only child. Now, if I get my hands on these bastards, I will personally make sure that they-- - Just sit tight, and don't do anything stupid. (people chattering) (insects buzzing) (can crumbles) (clears throat) - I need, I need to go to the bathroom. (insects buzzing) (slow, dramatic music) Ow, ow, ah. - You try anything funny, and I'll cut that cute little face of yours. You understand me? - Yes. (slow, dramatic music) (water running) Oh! (slow, dramatic music) (fax machine beeping) - Oh yeah. (laughs) Now, grab a seat and have a listen to this. It's a pastor talking dirty sex to one of his parishioners. - So are you gonna bust him? - Give me a break. You know I'm after the real shifties. Yesterday, I tracked down the hacker that put the Manis Virus into circulation. One more day and the stock exchange could have come down. - Impressive. - Yes, I know. - So I heard you had a little trouble at work. Forensics? - Dick heads, right? At least I didn't tell 'em where they can stick their badge, not like someone else we know. - So, um, what else did you hear? - I heard your squad took a certain hit man out for a ride and he never came back. But, I also know that you would never be part of that. (bottles clink) Don't shoot me officer! (laughing) Uh, more importantly old pal, what are you doing here, man? You have not come to say good bye. - It's important. (heavy breathing) - [Rebecca] My name is Rebecca Castaldi. I'm alive. Follow these orders to the letter. If you inform the police, I will die. (heavy breathing) - So? What do you think? - This was recorded in a small house, timber construction with a tin roof. The room has white ants. Just joking. Insects outside would indicate bush land, probably city outskirts, no more than 50 clicks from the coast. There are only two people present at the time of the recording. - Anything else? - The male is mature, 40-plus. Slowed vocabulary, which suggests excessive alcohol and/or drug abuse. You wanna leave the tape with me? I'll see what else I can find. - You're a legend. - I know. Take off your pants. - Rick Davidson? - Horny machine. How long have you had it? - Uh, it seems like forever. So listen, you told me that Rebecca Castaldi was hanging with the wrong crowd, yeah? - Yeah. What, her father didn't mention it? - No. - That'd be right. He wouldn't, they're all bad news, the lot of 'em. The minute they found out she had a tab and her old man was loaded, she's on the A-list. They treated her like Miss World, but, I don't think she fell for it. - Hang on, hang on. So who are we talking about? - The Natoli brothers. It was Leo, the older one. He spiked her drink, she didn't have a clue. She was totally out of it. If I hadn't caught by, they would have gangbanged her for sure. - So when and where did this happen? - Uh, Nortleist Nightclub about a month ago? I belted Leo and then his brother Sam sliced me. Got me main artery, too. - What, because of what they did to her? - Yeah. (laughs) - So why is she hanging around these characters? - Her old man. He gave her an open tab at the club to get her away from me. - And why would he do that? - I wanted to marry her. He had other ideas. - Such as? - Well, he wanted her to marry a wallet for one thing. - Hang on, you mean like the Natolis? - No. Look, she was confused. He did everything to split us up. - All right, look, so where do we find these Natolis? - They work a patch out west at Nortleist Nightclub about midnight. - So, uh, you ever been for a ride in a Mustang? - No. (insects buzzing) Look over there. - [Les] That's good timing. How'd you know they were coming? - [Rick] I used to have a problem. Come here and get my stuff. I'm over it now, though. Becca helped be through it. - Hey. Hey, Lee Ting. You have something for me? Look a bit narrow there, make you mine. (grunts) (hits) - [Rick] That's Leo. That's his brother Sam. - [Leo] You owe my boys money? - They sold me some bad shit man. (snaps fingers) (slow, dramatic music) - Give him a bag of the eight. - Bullshit. I'll give the little prick an A-grade hiney. Hey scumbag, come here. (hits) (cries out) - How many times I gotta tell ya, give them what they pay for. (smacks) (grunts) - [Les] A bit jarring. - [Rick] Yeah, it's the way they play, eh. - [Lee] Thanks, Leo. - Last chance. You try it again and you can kiss your ass good bye. You got it? Piss off. (slow, dramatic music) - You got a minute? Oh, it's just you and me, Leo. - What's your problem, buddy? - Wait in the car. - I suggest you take that big mouth of yours for a walk. (grunts) Are you a cop? - Well let's just say that I can get you busted. - So you're not a cop? So how much is it gonna cost me? - Information. (slams) Where is Rebecca Castaldi? Hm? - You mean Rick's girlfriend? Is that what this is about? Look, she's just a babe, huh? She came on hot and strong, I decided I'd do her a favor, show her some real action. (slams) (grunts) - I'm only going to ask you one more time. Where is Rebecca Castaldi? (grunting) - I don't know. Oh. (heavy breathing) - That wasn't very bright getting out of the car. - You know, this is the blade Sam stuck me with. You should have seen the look on his face when I clubbed him. - So who do those blokes work for? - They're on site with the nightclub owner, Lyle Riskin, he's a real piece of work. I only met him once. A silver spoon stuck up his ass. - So what nightclub's that? - Nortleist. - Listen, eh, just get rid of that stuff, will ya? (phone dialing) Come on. - [Answering Machine] The mobile number you have called is currently switched off-- - Shit. (sighs) (soft music) (people chattering) (man laughs) - [Man] Oh, Les. - Marty. A dozen of your best roses. - Sure. - You're a friend to me. - Oh, you've been a couple with Michelle, huh? - Yeah, I think I'm breakin' her heart. - No worries. Listen, I have the very best, very best roses in Australia, eh? You are beautiful, aye? Thank you very much, the best. Thank you, eh?

What's your poison, Les Kearney? - Thanks, but, uh, I think I'll pass. - We don't know each other do we? - I have a problem. - You have a problem. - And we may be able to help each other. I'm looking for this young lady. - Who could forget a face like that? She's been here a couple of times. - [Les] Well someone spiked her drink and now she's missing. And we both know that's a serious matter. - Are you threatening me, Les? - Well I spoke to Leo Natoli, and he told me that he spiked her drink here, in your establishment. Now we both know how the licensing boys wilL play with that. Loss of license, loss of income, right? - What else did he say? - Oh, enough... To bring me here.

I heard about Rick Davidson. - He was a good kid. - Yeah, I'm sure he was, but he had a few problems, you know? - Well he loved your daughter. - And she was way too young for commitment. Look, I really need to talk-- - He didn't deserve to die. - Yeah, right, unfortunate. They called again, said they'll check in at six with the final instructions. - Look, I told you that I'd make some inquiries, that's it. - Come on, Les, you heard the tape. They'll kill her. - Then maybe, just maybe, you should go to the police, eh? - Look, I'll go after the bastards myself, if I have to-- - Yeah, where would you start? Do you know the Natoli brothers? - No, I don't. Why, who are they? - Well they're drug dealers. And they operate out of a nightclub that your daughter hangs out at. - Nortleist? Hang on, you're not saying Rebecca was on drugs. Then what? Are these dealers a part of this thing? - Well it's the best lead that I have so far. - Oh, Christ. I think I'm being followed. - You wanna pursue this, you let me pursue this. You hear me? (car starts up) You hear me? - All right. But no cops. (motorcycle revs) (waves crashing) (phone ringing) - Les Kearney. Jack? Jack? Jack, I spoke to the homicide boys last night, and there's nothing more I can add to that. Are you kidding? What now? Give me 30 minutes. I didn't know you cared, Jack. So have the print boys finished with my car? - Just picked up the transit van. It's got the works. Wanna check it out? - Eh, not right now. - I'm heading up to Byron for a month. Great surf. - Did you hear about Rick Davidson? - Yeah. - I spoke to his mum this morning. She had to go and ID the body. - If there's anything I can do. - You can get Matthews off my back. - Mate, why do you keep pissing him off? - You know, since I got out of that job, it's like I've become the enemy, you know, it's... - He's from the old school. And with him on the surf club committee, it's making life a misery for all of us. - Listen, uh, I've got this job, and I need your help. - Then I guess we're not going to Byron. (waves crashing) (birds chirping) (scoffs) - That's cheating. - Yeah, and what would you know? - My dad taught me. - Oh yeah, well, he's a real winner your dad, isn't he? - Do you know him? - Let's just say I know all about him.

Nice company you keep. - Yeah. - Anything you wanna tell me? Yeah, well just don't get yourself caught. - I'll see ya. (knocking) (birds chirping) Mrs. Davidson? - Yes. - Hi, my name is Les Kearney. I didn't get a chance last night to pass on my condolences. But what you may not be aware was that, uh, your son, Rick, was helping me with an investigation regarding the disappearance of his girlfriend, Rebecca. - He was such a good, loving son. I don't know what I'm going to do without him. - Yeah, I'm very sorry. - Well have you found Rebecca? - Um, no. Rick told you that she was missing? - He was going to propose to her that morning. (sobbing) - Would you mind if I came inside? I'll only take a moment. (slow, dramatic music) (birds vocalizing) - Rick suspected that something was wrong when Rebecca didn't turn up. - So about what time was that? - Well. They were going to meet before work. And when she didn't show, he went looking for her. He found her car and then he called her father straight away. Mr. Castaldi was furious. He didn't like Rick. - I know. Please. - Thanks. And then Rick was just about to call the police when Mr. Castaldi turned up here and, uh, he told Rick that Rebecca had been kidnapped and that if he told the police, that her life would be in danger. - Did he ring the police? - No, and he told me not to say anything to anyone. And, I respected his wishes. Now he's gone. How do you like your tea? - Black, thank you. Can you tell me, um, where is Mr. Davidson? - He's um, taken on two jobs just to try and get on top of the mortgage, you see. We're five months behind and the bank wants to repossess the house. - Rebecca couldn't help you with that? - She offered, but we don't want charity. - Does Mr. Davidson know that Rebecca is missing? - Not yet, no. - Would you mind if I spoke to him? - Um, well he spends his nights at Dural. He's sharing a place with a couple of other guys. It's called, uh, The Hunter. It's one of those men-only lodges. Silly, isn't it? I mean, in this day and age. (slow, dramatic music) (puttering overhead) (Rebecca grunts) (phone ringing) - Come on Michelle, pick up. (phone ringing) - Hello? Hello? (slow, dramatic music) - [Les] I don't wanna hurt you. - So are you gonna bust me? - You just answer my questions. Do you know Rick Davidson? - I've seen him around. - You know he was murdered? - [Lee] Yeah. - Who killed Rick Davidson? - No idea, mate. He robbed the wrong people the wrong way, man. - Like the Natoli brothers? - And others. - He bought his stuff here. - He used to and then he got off it. - Who finances the operation? - Some say a nightclub owner. - What, and you don't think so? - I'm a 200 a day speed freak, not a cop. (dramatic music) - You didn't answer my question. - Someone manufactures the speed up north, man, that's all anyone knows. - Who supplies the Natoli's? - Why don't you fuckin' ask them? (groans) - Maybe I will and I'll use your name. Hm? - No, man please. - Hm? - No, no please. - When's their next big score? - Four o'clock man, I pick up my stuff at four. I gotta go, man, please. Man, I didn't tell you anything. (slow, dramatic music) - Shit. - Sam Natoli, breaker, druggie. Leo. Assaults, resist arrest, asshole. Riskin, no priors. You done good Wheels. (knocking) Hi. (slaps) - You bastard. Huh? Well who do you think you are, hm? Oh, you used to have manners, yeah. You don't return my calls. I waited for you for two hours-- - Look, I tried to call you, but-- - Yeah, but nothing Les. There's always an excuse. Since you've left the force you've become nothing but what? You're insufferable, you're selfish. You don't seem to care about us. - Michelle, that is not right. - Yeah? Les, you can't just hang around a surf club all day wait for someone to hire you. But if you were serious about this, you would rent an office. You would put up a little sign like a normal person. I mean come on Les. You are a grown man. Okay what is it, you don't wanna change? Well maybe it's time we went out own way. - Michelle. Look, I took a job yesterday and this kid got killed. - What? - I should have stayed with him, but-- - Okay, who, what kid, Les? What are you talking about Les? You weren't involved in that shooting incident at Nortleist Nightclub? Les, why didn't you call me? - I couldn't. - Les. I am so sorry. Look, I didn't know. But honey, you can't save everyone. - He was 25. - Okay, but there's nothing you can do about that now. - Well maybe there is. I just wish I knew what it was. (slow, dramatic music) (puttering overhead) (slow, dramatic music) (puttering overhead) (slow, dramatic music) (gasps) (soft country music) - Now, where were we? You'd like to make a mortgage payment inquiry on behalf of the Davidson's right? - Uh, Irene Davidson, yes. - Okay. Now, if you're a relative, or you have some other proof of authority, I need to see it first. - Uh, neither. Look, I just simply wanna know how much is owed and how soon the bank intends to foreclose. - Well I'm sorry Mr. Kearney, but bank policy prevents me from disclosing that kind of information without authority. - I understand. Look, I simply wanna help the Davidson family with their problem. - The bank has rules and regulations, Mr. Kearney. But off the record, I can tell you that I appreciate your good intentions, and I can put your mind at ease by telling you that the financial situation has been taken care of. - Well does Irene Davidson know that? She thinks that the bank is going to foreclose in a couple of days. - Well, you must be mistaken because Mr. Davidson addressed the situation personally three days ago. Now if you'll excuse me. - Thank you, but just one last question. Can you tell me where that deposit was made? - Galston. - Thank you. Mind not squashing my car, Jack? - I'm in no mood for bullshit, Les. Who killed Rick Davidson? - Well I have you a statement about that earlier. - You wanna continue this dance, do you? - What part of I've already helped you, Jack, don't you understand? - I've got reason to believe that you're withholding information on a murder investigation. If that proves to be the case, I'm gonna charge you. Do you read me? - Oh I read you Jack. But why the harassment? - Because you crossed the bloody line and now you have to deal-- - Yeah and what line's that, Jack? What, you wanna know why I left the police force, is that it? You wanna know that? 'Cause I'll tell ya. It's so I wouldn't end up a total asshole like you, Jack. - We've got another murder, Les. And surprise, surprise, you were seen in the victim's company. Now you wanna tell me what you were doing in Ferry Stone last night and again this morning? - Well you know, sometimes I travel. - You just don't get it, do you? - Get what Jack? - Murder, drugs, and you're right in the bloody middle of it. You know what? I reckon you're gonna go down with it. - Oh you'd like that, wouldn't you? - Lee Ting was found murdered an hour ago. And we got you placed at the crime scene. - All right so I met him, so what? - Met him? My information has you assaulting him on the bloody foot path outside the railway station. - So what are you gonna do Jack? You gonna caution me, you gonna arrest me, what are you gonna do? - You give me one good reason why I shouldn't take you down to the police station and arrest you right now. - 48 hours, Jack. You give me 48 hours and you'll get your result, all right? - You know why I'm going to give you 24 and not 48 hours? 'Cause I reckon 24 hours is just enough time for you to hang yourself. - Well thanks for your support Jack. - 24 hours. - Oh shit. Missed the drop. You got anymore information about how the tape arrived? - I double checked the courier files. The tape couldn't have come through Castaldi's office without being logged by the receptionist. - Which means it's either an inside job, or Castaldi's not telling us everything. - Could be. - So what else you got? - Um. The surf club don't want you to run your business on the premises. - Publicity after Rick's death. - Yeah. - So who's behind that, Matthews? - He's on the committee and he pulls a lot of weight. This investigation hasn't helped your cause. - So you've got any other good news? - No. We can still go to Byron. - Eh, wanna back it up in your driveway? - Go for it. - See you mate. - Well? - I want you to stall them. We need more time. - No way, mate. Look we agreed if you didn't get something-- - The more time that we have, the more chance that we have of finding Rebecca alive. Now while we're waiting for the call can you tell me again how the tape arrived? - The tape? I don't know, it just arrived on my desk, why? - Did it come through downstairs? - No idea. - Can you give me a list of names of all your employees? - What, now? - Yes. Now. - Liz, bring me a list of all our employees. - [Liz] You have a call on line two. - Bob Castaldi. - [Man] Have you got the goods? - Yes. And the bank confirmed that the transfer of funds will be in by the end of trading today. Now, I can draw the cash first thing in morning. - Listen, you dipshit. Didn't I say six pm? - Look, I did everything I could. You can't just draw a million dollars out of the bank without raising suspicion. Now, the money's there, okay? But the bank won't release it until the morning. Look, what about my daughter? Is she okay? - Yeah, she's alive. Now you listen real carefully. One more fuck up and she dies. You got that? - Yes. - Right. Now you be down to the bank by nine o'clock, you draw out the cash, and you get back to your office by 9:30, and you sit by the phone, the next call will be it. You understand? - Okay. Now please, can you just tell-- (sighs) - Is she all right? - Yeah. Heres your list. - You did good Bob. Jim Davidson. Is that any relation to Rick? - Step father. - Does he work here? - On site. Left a couple of weeks back. - Well why would he do that? - No idea. I mean, I fired him about two months back with some union heavies we were having problems with, but, Rebecca asked me to keep him on, which I did. That's when I discovered she was planning to marry his step son. (phone ringing) - [Liz] Mr. Castaldi, I have your wife on line one. - I took your advice, told her this morning. Now give me a couple of minutes; she's pretty upset. - Look, um, sit tight. I'll be back about eight. - Hi, how are ya? Yeah. No, it's... (upbeat pop rock music) ♪ Can't keep a good man down ♪ (slow, dramatic music) (soft music) (knocking) - You after Paul? - No, no, Jim. Jim Davidson. - Speak up? - I wanna talk to Jim Davidson. - Oye, him and Paul are down at the docks. - Thanks. (dog growling) (dog growling) (slow, dramatic music) Jim Davidson? Hi, my name's Les Kearney. - [Jim] Piss off, I'm busy. - Look, I'm making inquiries in relation to the disappearance of Rebecca Castaldi. I was also with your son last night, when he was murdered. - You a cop? - No. - So what do you want? - I spoke to your wife this morning. She's very upset. She still believes that the bank's gonna foreclose on the house. - What's that got to do with you? - Well I've checked. The mortgage repayments were made three days ago. So where'd you get that sort of money? You left Castaldi Constructions three weeks ago. - Who told you that? - Bob Castaldi. (tools clattering) - Castaldi tried to buy me. When he heard Rick and Rebecca were planning to marry, he offered me cash to get Rick to call it off. - You took the money? - But I didn't do what he wanted. - So, can you tell me about these, um, union heavies that got sacked? - Listen, you keep your nose out of this or you might find yourself in deep shit. (slow, dramatic music) - This dickhead bothering you, Jim? - [Jim] Not really, he was just leaving. - Is that your shit heap back there, blocking the drive? Are you fuckin' deaf? - Just take your hand off me. I'm warning you. - Yeah. (hits) (grunts) (coughing) - Look, Les, whoever you are, you don't know who you're playing with. - Well as you can see, I'm very concerned. - You should be. He's heavy. - What, as in union heavy? Stand over? - If you want my advice, you get your ass out of here, fast. - Who is he? - Paul Sterling. He's a lot of things. I've already said enough. - If you need my help, you can contact me at the Seawind Surf Club. You understand? You touch him, and you'll have me to deal with. (spits) - Yeah, I look forward to it, mate. (slow, dramatic music) (snoring) (phone ringing) (slow, dramatic music) (cans clattering) (hits) (yells) (phone ringing) (slow, dramatic music) (cans clattering) (phone ringing) (slow, dramatic music) (dramatic music) (man yells) (yells) (yells) (dramatic music) (man yelling) (yells) (dramatic music) - Jesus. Go away, get off! Go away! No! (crashing) (insects buzzing) (slow, dramatic music) - Oh it's you, just Les. - I got 12 hours. 12 hours to find Rebecca Castaldi before she buys it, and I know jack shit. What have you got? - Well, I took a bit of a liberty after I sent you that email on the Natoli's. I tapped the nightclub's phones. Now don't shoot me, after Riskin came up clean, I just thought I should dive a little deeper. - And? - Well, Bob Castaldi called Riskin. Your name was mentioned, and Castaldi threatened him. Now, I didn't get the whole of the conversation, but, Riskin was on the back foot. - That's gold. - Fuck silver and bronze. - Thanks. Come on, come on. (electronic pop music) Boss here? - He's busy. - Good. (electronic pop music) (soft music) - Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, again. (laughing) Ooh, yes, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh. (laughing) I, uh, was expecting you, Les. Lila. Give me a few minutes. - Thank you. - Well that's good because I don't have a lot of time. - Seems to be the way of the world these days. No one seems to have any time. - So have the Natoli's been in? - Oh, straight to the chase. Is something on your mind, Les? - You know, I don't understand you. You run a successful business and yet you allow stand over men and drug dealers to operate openly. - You have proof of that? I don't think so. Let me be directly, as I know who you are and what you want. Can't help you. - Why would Bob Castaldi call you? - Business. (chuckles) (yells) (cracking) (yells) Castaldi called. He was concerned about the drugs. He slapped a caveator. Another investment. - I thought you owned this establishment. - Castaldi has a 30% stake in this plate. (yells) (cracking) (yells) Castaldi came in one night, I approached him. He said that he would finance the refit of the place for a piece of the action, but he had union troubles. Castaldi fired the unionists. They refused to leave the site. It got nasty. (cracking) (groans) - You want me to stop? (Lyle mumbles) So the union boys came up with a solution? - The union delegate offered us a way out. He... He said he would fit the place out so I could reopen the club. - And you and Castaldi agreed to that? - We had no choice. It was to be a three-way split. Castaldi agreed on the condition that his others are to be left alone. - So where do that Natoli's fit into this? - Security. - Hello, Les. (slow, dramatic music) I think it's time I shut that big mouth of yours. After you. (slow, dramatic music) You're dead, Riskin. (slow, dramatic music) - So why would you kill a kid like Rick Davidson? - Man, he would've got more than a bullet if I'd gotten to him first. (slow, dramatic music) - Not only Davidson. Sterling. The union rep. Why? - He was a marked man before you came along, Les. Like Ting, you talk too much, a bit like this scenario. - Yeah, except this time, we got you all to ourselves. - [Les] I'm very frightened by you boys. (slow, dramatic music) - [Male Officer] Sir, you have arrived at a random breath testing point, would you please breathe into the tube for a count of 10? - Oh, what have we got here, a little pig reunion? - Stay in the outside lane and slow down. One wrong move. (gun cocks) - [Male Officer] Thank you. - Oh shit. - She's coming out, mate. - Look, don't do anything stupid, Sam. Sam. - No. (engine revs) - What the fuck are you doin'? (laughing) (dramatic music) (sirens blaring) (dramatic music) They're on to us. (sirens blaring) (dramatic music) Keep goin' man. - Yeah, I'm goin'. - They're on our ass. Go to the left, go to the left. Shut up. (sirens blaring) Go man, go. (sirens blaring) (dramatic music) Go. Keep going. (tires squeal) (sirens blaring) (gunshot) (gunshot) - All right. (heavy breathing) (slow, dramatic music) All right, Leo. You or the truck, eh? Eh? (laughs) (truck honking) You or the truck, Leo. (laughs) (truck honking) Fuck you. (dramatic music) - Keep it going, now. (dramatic music) Fuck! (heavy breathing) (slow, dramatic music) - [Les] Thanks very much. - [Man] And I loved Bob Dylan. (Les laughs) - What the hell happened to you? - Hey, well, I got hit by a truck. - Well, your mate's been looking for you. Apparently Jim Davidson turned up at the surf club asking for you. He's been badly beaten. - Why didn't you tell me that you were part owner of that nightclub? - Why the hell would I? It's got nothing to do with the kidnapping. - You should think back to that precious nightclub and the problems that you were having with your union heavies. - Hang on, what are you saying? You mean Paul Sterling's behind this? - Matty. Matty, wake up, wake up. - You all right? - Yeah, I'm all right. Listen, how's Jim Davidson holding up? - Eh, it's been knocked about, but he's okay. Wouldn't go to the hospital. And listen. He's got some information, and you're the only one he wants to talk to. - Wouldn't tell you? - No. - So you got the van here? - Downstairs. - All right, let's go. You know, I hope for your sake, that she's gonna be all right. - [Ace] Shit, he wasn't that bad when I left him. - Get an ambulance. Jim, can you hear me? - Sterling killed Rick. You have to stop him. The girl's at the farm. Lou Roberts place in Dural. - Okay. - The old hang gliding's curl. - Ambulance is on its way. - Make sure that Irene's okay. - You've got my word. (slow, dramatic music) It's just as Wheels described. Stop here. Back it up, give us five minutes. I expect to see your smiling face. (slow, dramatic music) - You know what that, uh, fucking weasel Davidson did? He torched the fucking land, and then took off. (slow, dramatic music) And what if he goes to the cops, huh? This is your fault. All you had to do was fucking watch her, yeah? (slow, dramatic music) You useless piece of shit. - You're the one who killed Jim's son. You brought all this heat down on us. - Oh. He had a big mouth, and so do you. (banging) (grunts) (dramatic music) (chuckles) Fucking live one, eh? (hits) (gun cocks) (hitting) (grunting) (hitting) (grunting) (hits) (grunts) (gunshot) (cracking) (yells) - You're a long way from Paddington, pal. (cracking) (grunts) (grunts) On your knees, on your knees. (Paul grunts) Do not move. She's alive. (phone ringing) - You're bloody lucky. You're a cowboy, Les. And I've still got a mind to charge ya. - You said 24 hours. Look, you've got drug distribution, two murders, and you're looking pretty good on the abduction. What do you need Jim Davidson for? - He's an accomplice. (chuckles) - He delivered a tape. - He's still a bloody accomplice. - The man's right, Jack. The guilty mind? You'll never get a conviction in court. Plus, he burned down the amphetamines lab when he found out that Sterling killed his only son, so what else do you want? - I wanna talk to him. - Don't twist him, Jack. He'll make a very good witness. (phone ringing) Jim. This is, uh, Detective Sergeant Jack Matthews. He's in charge of the abduction investigation. I suggest you tell him your side of the story. How are ya? - Bloody awful, what do you think? (phone ringing) (upbeat jazzy, big band music) (applause) - Thanks. - Listen. This one is coated with tear proof material. We definitely guarantee it. - Listen, Mack, call for Les, he'll sort you out. (applause) Thanks. It all looks like you're having a great night. - How do you do? Nice to meet you. (soft music) (people chattering) - [Ace] Bob Castaldi, make your way to the stage please. - Excuse me. (chuckles) - Can you excuse me? - [Woman] Yeah, sure. (applause) - Thank you guys. I'll have to apologize for... - Hi. - [Les] Hey. - Can we talk? - Sure. Hey, I didn't think you were comin'. - I'm not staying. - Don't do this. Don't do this. - I can't put into words how I felt when Rebecca was kidnapped. But I can tell you that that experience has taught me a thing or two about my own selfish attitude to others. I have one in particular. So now I'd like to give something in return to all those lifeguards who, like Les, save lives everyday to serve others. Les Kearney, would you like to come to the stage, please? (applause) Les? (applause) And from my daughter Rebecca, my wife Hazel, and myself, and in memory of young Rick Davidson, a very special thank you. (applause) - This will go towards a boat. (applause) - This will go towards a new inflatable rubber boat for the club. Now keep that applause going for our next very special guest, please make him feel welcome, Mr. Kevin Johnson.
