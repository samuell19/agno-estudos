The King has summoned us to the palace? Then? Even I don't know what is the state of the business. If you want to know, you'll have to come with me. We've to go now? Alright then, I'll come with you. You would follow me? -Yes I will. If you would be so kind to follow me to... ...the palace so we shall bow before the King. Do you know where we're at? -Where are we now? We have arrived at the city's gate. -Oh! We already arrived. I have been meaning to ask you. Do you wish to... ...come in with me or do you want to wait here? I will wait outside. You want to wait outside, because you already tired aren't you? Yes, indeed I'm tired from earlier. -It's okay, you go and sit there. Why are you cough? Are you tired as well? It's fine, I will wait here. I will go in to see the King. Your Highness! I'm back, Your Highness! Oh! -Is that really so. Where is the person I asked you to bring? I've already invited him, Your highness. He demands you to summon him yourself, Your Highness. I have to summon him myself, Awe? If I were to summon him, what should I address him? Oh that is right. I forgot to mention that before. Would you be so kind to wait a bit Your Highness. Hey, hey! Stand up! Your Highness wishes to address you. Then? -What is your name? You said you were my friend! -I've forgot your name. My name is the 'Same As Before'! -Same as before? Why didn't you told me it is same as before. Your Highness! I know his name now, Your Highness. What's his name? -Same As Before. So his name is Same As Before? -That is right, Your Highness. Should I address him that? -Just like that, Your Highness. If you say so. -Carry on, Your Highness. Oh dear, Same As Before! Hey! Come here you! -What's the matter now? Why you didn't come in when the King summoned you? Take this! It's not Same As Before. -Then? "As Usual". Why don't you told me it was As Usual, you fool. My bad, Your Highness. That was not his name. What is his name then? -It's not Same As Before. Then what is his name? -As Usual, Your Highness. So his name is As Usual? -Yes indeed, your Highness. Call him, Your Highness. -Where are you As Usual! It's wrong again! -How is it wrong? Hey girl! You can come and sit here with me. You'll get a better view of the show. It is even better if you sit on my lap. That's my wife! Hey! Next time, why don't you stamp on her forehead "Married". Are you looking for trouble? Hey! If that night didn't turn out that way... ...I wouldn't have left my hometown. I would have still played in my dad's makyung. I wouldn't have been here in Kuala Lumpur. Ever since the incident in makyung play... ...my parents have asked me to leave the hometown. My dad feared I would disgrace his makyung. I could not play makyung? How could I go on with my life? Makyung is me... ...my flesh and blood. Same goes with fighting. If I were asked to perform makyung... ...or fighting..... Awi, my cousin... ...invited me to Kuala Lumpur. He said he's working on a makyung project I agreed to it... ...for the sake of my father... ...not because I'm running away from what happened that night. No! Here's how it is... ...this is my niece, Nancy. She's been back for a week from her study at a university in Bangkok. She majored in Nusantara Traditional Arts. So, she's back for a research on makyung. By all means, Mr. Jimmy. It's hard to find youths who're expert in makyung nowadays. I can guarantee that. It's better if you think through by istikharah prayer first, isn't it? Is that right, Awi? -Yeah, that's right. That's good. Good. Jimmy, they're here. I have to go. -Sure. Here, the day after tomorrow, do visit. I'll send you the address. -Alright, thank you, Mr. Low. Okay, thank you. "Welcome home. Your return has been awaited, Sherly Ang." Take these. I won't do it. -Why not? It's like I'm selling makyung. To hand it over to other people, Awi. Silat owned by Malay,... ...now it has loss its authenticity. Even the Dikir Barat, it's others' as well. And then, what's left for us? Let me tell you. Our people would be mad if others don't respect our culture... ...our art, and ignorant of it all. But its all our fault, Duan. If we didn't teach them... ...how will they know our culture, art, and language? If they learn the art, they'll know it all. Makyung belongs to the Kelantanese. Jimmy Ang is a Kelantanese. His niece is a Kelantanese. Duan, it's not wrong. We'd benefit from it too if she masters it. Really, think about it well. Just return all those money. -Really?! Return them? No. Take it. I've taken RM200 for the groceries. Damn it! Hey, you can't repossess our car like that! I was in repossession business too, you fool! Don't mess things here! Moron Kelantanese! Hey! What did you just say? Duan! Who are you? Who are you? -He's my friend, you moron! If his name is Mamat... ...you curse on Mamat. Darn it, Mamat! Damn Mamat! You don't swear in the name of Kelantan! I'm from Kelantan! You moron! Take it. Paid, thank you. Praise be to God. I'm Pok Su. Pok Su Ki. Come on. Get in. Why would I? Just to get to know you. I saw what you did there. It's great! Amazing! Defending our honour. Get in. Okay, with conditions. If I'm safe, send me back here. If not, take me to the hospital. This is what I like. Really! At Selayang, Kuala Lumpur... ...people call me Pok Su Ki Buah. I'm Duan. What a nice name. Duan is from Arabic name, Ridhuan. Ridhuan means sincerity. Isn't that great? How long have you been in Kuala Lumpur? It's my second day here. No wonder you're mad. What's your job? I help my friend selling burger. What if... ...I offer you to work for me? Work with me. Be my bodyguard. I'm sorry, Pok Su. I came to Kuala Lumpur for another job. Not in my bone to be a bodyguard. Do you smoke? No, I don't. No wonder he's fit and strong. Not a smoker. Actually, I don't agree on what she does. I don't like her coming back here. If you want to meet her, better to meet abroad than here. I'm worried, I'm scared. Mummy! Mummy? I have lost my child! I'm right here, Mummy! I'm not lost! You came back as my niece. Not my daughter! I had to admit it! Denying that you're the child I gave birth to! Let it be... ...either way we know she's our daughter. Papa,... ...they know I'm here. Mind your own business! He's related to me, to you as well. With all we Kelantanese. I can't take it. You shouldn't be nosy. If that's the case... ...you'd be defending all Kelantanese in Kuala Lumpur? You're only asking for trouble. You will be fighting every single day. I'm not defending Kelantanese... ...I defend the dignity of Kelantan. Take it this way, Awi. Let me fight with all the people in Kuala Lumpur. As long as you don't stand in my way. Don't have any business with Pok Su Ki. By the way, who is he? Oh, took you quite long going to tahlil? It's you, Nulik! I've been waiting for ages. Even my toothache gone worse. There was a tahlil at the surau. Why are you here then? What did he just ask? Of course we've to see you since you're in Kuala Lumpur. How do you know that I'm here? Pak Ngah Hadi called me to look after you. We're both related. Pak Ngah Hadi is also my father's cousin. I see. No wonder you look a bit like him. Wow, who knew? We're all related with Pak Ngah Hadi. Eh, let's talk inside. -Get in. That's okay. Make some drink first. Finally, you are in Kuala Lumpur. Yeah, finally. Duan, you got to follow me. I will be better if you with me. I came here to perform makyung. Not to fight. Well, just play it as you wish. Just finish the main job first, then come to me. Hey, give me the card. Well, that's my number. Write down your number. Save it. What's with Pok Su Ki? Do you know Pok Su Ki? Pok Su was the one... ...who protect Kelantan people in Kuala Lumpur. You howl my name. If there were police or my enemies, how it'd turn out for me? Send this guy home. Take him to his house. Go! What a nuisance all these new guy. Where were we? About the girl. I want to see her. Give me a few more days. He said it s being arranged. He has all those 5 years to arrange. Is that not enough? For five years, you can wait patiently. Surely, you could wait for another month. You don't talk to me about being patient. She wasn't here for 5 years. Now, she's back. Two weeks. Hey, how should I speak to that Chinese girl tomorrow? Would she understand me speaking like this? Speak however you like. The money's been paid. Awi would take any job as long as it pays. That's how he is. It's been some times I've done this. If I took after my parents advice... ...I cannot live in Kuala Lumpur. I quit my job. I used to be the supervisor of the Motorola factory. With a salary of two thousand ringgit. I quit. I went back to ask you to stay here. But you were in fights that night. I initially had a plan for you. But God also has a plan for you. That night, if you weren't caught up in the fight... ...your father wouldn't have let you come here. Oh really. Your so-called plan to tell me to dishonour makyung. So much for planning. Hey, here's another one. What's this? To perform makyung. "Good News. Makyung to Tokyo. Confirmed." In Tokyo! I'm here just to drop him off. Duan, come on out. Okay, Mr. Low. Hi, Duan. Please, sit. I'll make the drinks. Cold or hot? I just had my drink. There is mineral water. Halal. Let's start now. Sit anywhere you like. How do we start? I don't know what you want. I want to know everything. Why not we begin from its history? Can we? Would you understand my dialect? I might just ramble and you'd be lost. Come again? Oh, no. -Try a bit slower. Oh, my! It's alright. It's okay. What about you record it. Who is this guy? What makes you trust him? Come on sis, how long do you want to confine her? It is the Traditional Arts Festival. It must be fun! -It'd be cool to perform makyung! It doesn't matter if it's in Japan or Kuala Lumpur. But if in Japan even better! Make it happen! You have to work well with Nancy. It's hard to work with this Chinese girl. She doesn't understand a thing I said. She kept laughing because she couldn't follow me. Take her to the makyung's practice. Let her see with her own eyes. She can also ask the others. Hey! Come! Come! Tonight, we try with Duan. Come! Come! Sure! Let's go up! Let me play the rebana. Can you go up? Sit closely. Duan! Duan! Is he still asleep? Duan! It's you, Nulik. What's up? -God! Why still in sarong? Put on your pants! My guy just got beaten up! Hurry up! You're slow! -Practice is at three. Awi will be picking us up. We may run a bit late. It's okay, I'll send Duan later. Just share the location to Duan. All good. Gosh! Why put such an effort? Why the effort? Effort? It's just pants. If I just go naked, you'll be mad. Take this inside. Hurry up! I don't know where this falls into, obligatory or not. I think it's obligatory this time. Hurry up! Hurry! Put them on in the car. I have to wait for you! Because he said he's your guy! It's my guy. I told him to get the car. That's my car! -So it's all yours? What of mine, then? -If you want it, fight for it! It's late! Those are Fendi's guy from Bukit Bintang. What could we do? What else? You've fought them already. You only come see me after fighting them, right? Just deal with it. Duan, too? Thank God, he was there. That's how Kuala Lumpur is. Just like I said. We, Kelantanese, won't fight each other. Cigarette? Nice. Fendi of Bukit Bintang. What were you up to with Nulik? -Nothing. It's the first day, and you're late. Here's the script. What script is this? I'm not used to deal with scripts. Hey, this isn't your father's makyung. This is Kuala Lumpur's. Read it or not, up to you. Duan Nago bogho. Finally, I can work with you, Duan. Do you still remember me? Oh, my. If I don't remember you.. ...I must be dying. People call you as... ...Kuala Lumpur's makyung Guru. That one is playing the lead role. Not from Kelantan? Not even a Malay. Parawathy. You can call me, Salmi. He's very knowledgeable in makyung. Here, don't leave behind the script. Have a little bit of respect on the script. Makyung is being researched by the Chinese... ...played by the Indian. How can I not be angry? Duan, we shouldn't be angry. We should feel ashamed. Look at her. Okay? It's hard to play makyung. -No. You're okay. A fast-learner. It's still difficult. I am not Kelantanese. Most Kelantanese not really into makyung. Some know nothing at all, some couldn't bother. You're doing alright. Still interested, right? Kak Mah said... ...I should learn from you. You are an expert, who knows everything. I don't necessarily know how to teach. You summoned me, Your Highness... ...among these attendants. Where would you wish to conquer, Your Highness? Which virgin of these states you desire? Why don't you tell me, Your Highness. So, here I am to shut the studio's door. The tale here begone, we tell ours elsewhere. The tale ends here, out we go. Out we go, cik wei. The tale here begone, we tells ours elsewhere. Alright then. The history goes like this. It has been dated back to... ...Tengku Petra. Tengku Petra was a royal, you know. He was a royal. It was passed down... ...or he was also known as Tengku Temenggong. From there, makyung began to get well-known in Kelantan. Makyung back then was already celebrated by the King. Then... ...it was passed down to Cik Kemala. That was the time. If you want to include the time before that again... ...some people say 800 years. Some also claim 400 years. But the place of origin of makyung varies. Some say It s here, some say it's there. About that... ...I'm not too sure about that... ...so, let's find more from the books. Okay. Yes, sure. -We need to read the books. You need to learn the dialect, the food... ...learn the nature and setting. Then, it'll be easy to learn makyung. Yes, sir. This is budu isn't it? -Yes, this is budu. My uncle's house has it and he loves it. But, you know what? -What is it? I have never seen even once my aunt prepared it for him. Pity him. But it will taste better to eat with your hands. Go wash your hands at the back. There's a sink. Let me take you there. Hey! I did nothing. -What did you do there at my car? It was a mistake, alright? Don't do it again. Or I'll do the same. Eh, do eat. I thought you've left. I won't leave you halfway. Especially when you're eating the food I serve. Pok Su. I know you can solve this. I don't trust Low anymore. Because Low and Jimmy are both Chinese? But keep in mind, Jimmy and I are from Kelantan. Because we are both Malays? So, because we're Malay, I have to help? No. Not because of that. This is solely business. I did business with Low. He couldn't do it. I'm at a loss. Now, I'm offering it to you. If you can do it right... ...you'd gain a lot. Look, you give me time. Hey! Low, I gave him time, He couldn't do it. I don't have time. I'm here as you've summoned, Your Highness. You're finally here, Awe. That's right. Where's your friend, Awe? -He's outside. Tell him to come..... Come in and see me. -Come in and see me? Tell him to come in and see me. Okay, Your highness. What is it, Your Highness? I had a stomachache. Hey! That's my spot! Where's mine? -That's your spot! I want to sit here. -You can't. I want to sit here. -It's mine! That's yours! Look at yourself! -Forgive me, Your Highness. Sit down! "Assoua eko, Yokohama!" "Haip, Ajinomoto." Samurai. Ultraman. Why are you fooling around? Do you think this is a joke? Well, it's a fool I perform as, don't I? Playing fool and fooling around are two different things! You're fooling around! If you're playing around just for the sake of Japan, then don't! Mah! Ask him, is he here to perform or fool around? If he's still fooling around, do not allow him to come tomorrow. It's okay. Foolish old man. Try to be as good as you were with Salmi. You're being hard on him. Pity him. He was being foolish. He should only be goofy if its suits the story. But it doesn't. Just nonsense. Even so, say it nicely. What if he quits? Who will replace him? He should have quit from the start... ...if he can't be serious about it. Isn't his role is to be goofy? Unlike Pakyung, the serious one. That's not it. That's wrong. Being goofy has its serious side. Only then it would suit it. Besides... ...even you have to be goofy, there is a part for it. There's a part to be serious. That's ridiculous. Somad, do not get involved. Duan, mind your own business. You seem to know I'm coming! You fried the crackers? You didn't even hesitate to dig in! You seem very hungry! How is it? -Duan, to make it short. Haji Nor Motor, used car. You don't have to know it. He told me to collect from the people who owed him. Three used car owners owe him money,... ...more than 500 thousand ringgit. He'll pay us 50 thousand each. For five people and 10 thousand each. Don't think too hard. It's simple, Duan. I've done it before. That's why he's asked my help again. No, why doesn't he sue them? It's a hassle to involve the court. It'll take years and won't be settled. I can settle it in a week or two. It's an opportunity, Duan. You better asked someone who used to this kind of job. Okay. Think about it. I'll ask you again later. We're going now. We're going now. Eh! Sorry. I've forgot to inform you that we were about to see... ...the makyung practice. Why can't you wrap up your interview and research here? Why today out of sudden? When we watch they practice, only then we can have a feel of makyung. That's right. With live performance,... ...I can learn a lot of things. Do you really wish to expose yourself? Do you know how dangerous it is out there? People who are looking for you are the same race as him. You still hang around him often. How long should I stay afraid? Because of this, I can't admit that you're my Mum. Maybe they don't know I'm back. They could be just guessing. Be careful. Take this opportunity to meet with Mrs. Halimah. You can ask her. Ask the actors, ask Pakyong. Do they talk like you? Why? You're afraid? You won't understand it? It's okay, I'm here. There's no difference if you're here or not. Hey! You're doing a study on makyung not the theaters performance. This is the language of makyung! Yes. I got it. Did I get it right? -Not "Pahe", "Pehe". "Pehe, pehe". Sounds like "paha". Duan, I'm going to the restroom. Hey! Open the door! What do you want from her? Hey! Open the door, damn it! Damn it! This is Nancy. She's a university student in Bangkok. She's doing a study on makyung. Kak Mah. Many has come here to ask me about makyung. That's very true. -Thank you, kak. But, won't I disturb the practice? Oh, no. It's okay. Sure. Go. Have some chat first. Have a chat with Kak Mah. Why is she here? You said to bring her here. Don't mess with Salmi's mood. She looks different now. See? Duan! Can you sing? Salmi would like to learn. Sure. Okay. Can I record it? Sure, you can. Actually, I'm not the one you should ask about Makyong. It's all with Duan. Make up your mind on one of them... ...or else both will be heart broken. What if you arrange one for me. Nonsense. I'm not into anyone. I'm just saying... ...that there are two women... ...who're getting closer with me day by day. Gosh! I've never felt like this. You need to know your strength. Not just beating guys around. Your art knowledge is priceless. Knowing Nancy is a bit risky. There are people stalking her. They followed our car... ...up to our makyung practice hall. It can't be. Stalking her or you? They're Chinese. It couldn't be me. Be careful. Could it be her lover? -No idea. Hang on. Maybe they got the wrong person. Sherly? Who's that? Does she have two names? I can't even say. Useless fool. Just a picture? All that money I've spent on you. Just for a picture. If I handed it... ...over to someone else, it could be settled. I could sleep at night. Boss. As the Malay proverb goes... ...when pulling hair from a pot of flour... ...pull it slowly, so it won't be messy. If..... If we pull it all now, it would get stuck. And I'm telling you this too, as the Malays said it... ...if you fishnet is stuck... ...throw it all away! Got it? Bring them both to me! Get lost! Faster! Hit the gas! They're behind us! Faster! Faster! I can't go any faster! Let me take the wheel! Switch up! Hey! Who are you? Who are you? Armed men tried to kidnap you at the restaurant! Drove the car like a maniac! Who the heck are you? This is serious. I'm involved now! I'm not Jimmy Ang's niece. I'm his daughter. He's my father. My name isn't Nancy. It's Sherly. Oh, so that's it! I got a note... ...to stay away from you. This must be related to what happened seven years ago. It must be. Hey! How could you be living in peace, huh? I have your part. I haven't touched it. I got my part already. Two years I was in the prison. Now, I'm going to give you your part! Uncle Low suggested to report it to the police... ...and the video became the murder evidence. Two years later... ...Dino was sentenced to death. Before he was sentenced, papa sent me to Australia... ...to stay with his brother. He knew... ...that they will seek revenge. He sent me to the United States, for a plastic surgery. Not only my face that was changed, it was everything. Sometimes when I look in the mirror... ...I don't even know who I'm looking at. Am I being lied to? You're studying makyung as an upfront. No, Duan. I didn't lie. You've lied to me. No, I didn't lie to you! Yes maybe it was the initial thought... ...but as I learn more on traditional arts... ...it moved my heart. I believe this is my destiny, Duan. Destiny! It's my soul, Nancy's soul! Not Sherly's! I really want to continue the research. I used to have many kinds of business. There is a legal business. After what happened to Nancy, I decided to let it all go. I gave up those illegal businesses. Like your Islamic belief... ...there are still some that's not. I've said this so many times. Stop that research. Those makyung nonsense! Go back to Australia! I started all this and I will finish it! Why are you being so stubborn? Look at her! -Enough! For now, let me just take care of her. Wherever she goes, I'm with her. Even if her life is at stake... ...I'd be sure to risk mine first. Don't tell me I have to change how I look again, papa! Let me take care of Nancy. I have to finish my job too. But, just wait after the makyung performance. For now, we guard her together. Nancy! I've said before... ...I won't leave you halfway with the food I serve. Excuse me. Someone's waiting for me. Here is how I will... Here is how I will say to all of you. Here is how I will say to all of you. Come! You lot may enter the palace. Duan, you're too late. I'm here, aren't I? But if I were shot earlier, I won't be here. Shot? -I'll tell you tonight. Here is how I will say to all of you. Come! All may enter the palace. It is because I have a wish that is greater than any wish. Im already involve in this. I can't get out of it. Don't look for troubles, Duan. Both of you... ...are not used to fights. You don't know how it feels like. I know it all. Fights. Arts. Both has become my flesh and blood. You, Somad... ...my father showed me the arts. Then, it was my uncle, Pakngah Adi. He got me involved in the fights. Both occur when I was a teenager. That's my world. You don't know what it feels like! Hey! This! Have you been through this? I was 24 at that time. 10 years back. Not even in Malaysia. It was in Singapore. I was like you back then. Afraid of nothing. I was alone, against seven people. Two of my friends ran away. We shared a house and did contract work. We fought when gambling. There's nothing that hasn't been in me. Screwdriver? Metal? Knife? Two weeks, Duan! I had to be warded. I ran away to Kuala Lumpur. Nobody knew, Somad. Not even my parents. That's why no one know about this! Not because I'm afraid of this, no. I don't want to die in vain. Let me die for this art! Boss! I have to be careful around Jimmy. I have to be cautious. Are you still new to this business? Okay boss. I promise that..... Don't promise me! You, don't say anything. Listen to me. Now here's my promise to you. You've failed, you know? If you fail again... ...you're done. Bring those couple to me! Let me personally deal with them. Keep this in mind, Low. Exactly at 12 o'clock tonight... ...your three weeks are over. Means you've failed. Mummy. I'm going to watch Makyung performance. If you're going out... ...you might not be able to come home. You are praying every day, why can't you ask God to protect me? I'm praying every day for our safety and health. After getting married with your Papa... ...not even one day I don't pray for this. Not long after you went abroad... ...your Papa has come clean and gave up all his illegal businesses. My life was... ...so peaceful. But since you're back... ...life has become haywired. I felt so messed up. Don't you like me coming home? If you didn't come back... ...it'd be good for you and us. No matter what, I'm still going to watch the makyung performance. Makyung is important to me. If that so... ...ask your Papa to send you. Hey! Who is that? Hey! Hold on. I'll open the door. Where are you from? Watch out! It's open. Boss are not asking us to kill! Duan? Duan! Duan? Gosh! He's not here. He's not here. Was he dragged away? Let's just wait. What happened? What do you mean? I should be the one asking you. You were home, right? -I was out buying some food. Did you lock the doors? -How did you get home? Hey! The doors were open. This must be the thieves. Duan. They know our home. Thank God, it's our home. If they had gone to the makyung place... ...I'd have to return back home. It's alright. Just eat your dinner, I'll clean it up. I mean, noodles. Let me clean it up. What's wrong? -Thirsty. Sore throat. Was it Fendi or his guys? His guys. But I think coming from Fendi's instruction. If so, it means it's a big deal. It's a big deal. So Nulik, you bring Duan here. How can I help? I don't know, Duan. How do you want? Whatever happens, I can't leave Nancy. She wants to learn makyung! Oh, another thing. I need to face Fendi. So, I need your advice. My advice is simple. Just go back home. Go back to Kelantan for a few years. I remember when I failed my form three. My father used to say this to me... ...With his knowledge in makyung,... ...even those PhD students came to see him. Just like what you're doing now with Nancy. Your dad was like that too! Nancy should be here tonight. -Are you crazy? Or have you invited her? -I dare not. Sometimes, we got to be cowards. Papa! Are you heading out? Yeah. I thought you've promised to accompany me... ...to the makyung performance. Won't it be at night? -Did you forget? They're having the opening ritual this evening. It's important. I'm about to meet someone. I've promised them. -You've promised me too. I'll ask Uncle Low to accompany you, okay? Go call your uncle. Oh no! Duan! Can you help me? Sure, Your Highness, whom I deeply doted on. The King I care the most. -Why are you fooling around? What's happened with your back? Nothing, some mirror glass fell on me at home. How could it end up like this? I don't really know. But... ...lately my mind always think of you. Nonsense. Samad, Duan won't be feeling any cold in Tokyo. Found his warmer already. -No need for Tokyo. All is here. Even Kuala Lumpur is chilly. They're talking about us. -What is it about? They say Tokyo is cold, so we need warm dress. My oh my, having fun teasing us, eh? You must be careful when in a crowded place. Just be alert while watching the performance... ...and don't trust any stranger. Please remember. Yes I will, not to worry, Uncle's coming with me. Please look after her for me and please be alert. All these years, all I've done is for her safety. She is like my own daughter. As usual, I won't trust anyone. I accompany her by myself. I know, I'm very worried and feel uneasy. Don't worry, don't worry. Where do you sit? -Here. You must sit at the back! Don't you need to protect her? You sit at the back and protect her. Don't sit at the dark area. Sit at the brighter place, understand? You, always be with her, never let her alone! Fendi knew my daughter is home. He wasn't supposed to. I shouldn't know it too, right? Supposedly. Then? Well, you know my daughter's case five years ago. Everyone does, but you think we don't. How Fendi knowing her whereabouts still baffled me. Other than you, your wife, is there any other outsiders who knew? Low is the only outsider who knew. Her uncle. All this while, Low has been helpful. I'm sorry. I'm sorry to say this... ...it s possible that he's behind all of these. Eh, Nancy's with him! What, now? Hello? Papa! I have made a promise to Fendi. Don't joke around. Your uncle, me, when young I was immature. I was jailed for four years. When I was released... ...your grandfather had already passed away. All his properties went to your mom and papa. How about me? Never get a single cent. So how? I've to work under your papa. Became his pet dog. Controlled by him. You. You're the RM 5 million that I deserved. I've waited five years for this opportunity. No. It can't be..... You're the one who love me the most and pampered me since I was young. Duan, Salmi's not here. Go and look for her. Where could she be? -Inside. Is the ritual doing fine? -Afraid? Let's go. If we haven't trusted him, it wouldn't be like this. That's why I forbade her to come home in the first place. I don't want to face this kind of thing. I hope Pok Su Ki found her. If we can't even trust her own uncle... ...who else we can? Let's report to the police. Do you want to expose Sherly's identity? I'll kill my own brother. Boss! How are you? Fendi sends his regards. He thanked you. Your work ends here, Mr. Low. Duan! Come here. What is it? -Nancy is with Fendi. Pok Su Ki told me, we got to go. Awi! I have to go. Nancy has been kidnapped. Hey! It's tonight! You have your own job tonight! Nancy is my job too! I've made a promised right? I promised to teach her Makyong. If only I didn't take my clothes off and show you those scars... ...I wouldn't tag along with you. I regret showing it to you. Typical of Pakngah Hadi's blood. How did Fendi got hold of her? That one, Pok Su Ki didn't tell me. He just asked me to tell you. No, I mean how did Pok Su know? It's Pok Su! People like him knows everything. Did he know you teach Nancy? I told him. Sherly, I bought this old warehouse,... ...after three years you ran to Australia. But I didn't do anything to it. If I want to be richer that I am now... ...I can turn it to a high-class brothel... ...or to an international gambling center... ...yet, I refuse to. Because... ...I'm going to bury you here. Thank God you're here. I've said it before. You have to choose your friends wisely. Let's go. You know what, I want you to die... ...as "Sherly", not "Nancy". Pok Su! -Darn you! Take this. "Call from Salmi" "Sending location to Mr. Jimmy" This is Pok Su's ability... ...which is not on Low. If I count on Low... ...this kid won't be here. Pok Su! What are you trying to pull? Nulik, this is purely business.. Fendi gave me a job. It's that simple. From Mr. Low to me. He was sluggish. A million ringgit. For a job halfway done. I've said to you, to live in Kuala Lumpur one must be resilient. Listen, Duan. Being brave must have brains too! Don't be foolishly brave. Be smart! Kelantanese don't betray each other! That's what you said! In today's world Nulik... ...betraying each other is no longer a crime... ...not an insult but it's a business now. We're here not to talk! Makyung's waiting for us! Hey! Kak, Duan's not here. I've been try calling him, but there no response. The show's about to begin. He should be on standby! Awi's gone too! Awi! Where's he? -He'll be here, soon. He's not here. Yeah, the music is all ready. All has been set up. -We're doomed! Kak, Duan isn't here yet. We can't wait for him any longer. It will begin soon! Anyone sitting here? Din. Why? What's up? -Din, standby, would you? Replace Duan? -Come on. Hurry up! To all our guests, we welcome you... ...to our makyung performance of Dewan Muda Preview show. Let's welcome them! Duan! I can play as a fool too, Kak Mah. No need to be worried. There's just one part I'm not sure of. When I'm about to enter, what should I say? When Elder Clown would ask. I remember the rest but that. Din, if Elder Clown calls for you, just say anything. Just say you're eating, sleeping, anything, yeah? Is that okay? What are you doing up there? I'm sleeping. Is that okay? -Yes! Jepun! Pok Su! I'm a businessman, Nulik. You should understand I'm a businessman. We've known each other for some times. Very good buddy. You need to remember that, okay. Take my words, okay? I've known Duan even before you, Pok Su. I want you to die like how my brother died. I planned to hang both of you. But it doesn't go as plan. Duan! Duan! Duan! Look at yourself! Are you blind, Awe? Not yet, I just can't see clearly. Don't you know who I am? You're wondering if I know you? Raise up your hands! Raise it. Yes, like that. -Know who I am now, Awe? Your armpit's smell bad. Find the nearest hospital! No! Don't go to the hospital! Send me to the makyung performance place! They've been waiting. Mummy! Rumah PENA, behind DBP. Duan. I'd like to apologise. I doubted you all this time, Duan. Oh, my Royal Highness. Is that you, Awe, weh! -It is I, Your Highness. Of what reason Your Highness has summoned me? I have a task for you, Awe. -Yes, Your Highness. Bring your friend here, Awe. Is that so, Your Highness? It's okay. I'll go. Just wait here. Hey, my friend! I'm here! Are you home, my friend? Yes! I'm inside. Who's there, right outside my house? Can't even get a wink of sleep. It's me, your friend. Why do you want to see me? I'm here, with the news from the King. If you want to know, come down here. Okay then, where are you now? I'm outside your house. Be careful, I'm coming down now. Hey careful there, look into your heart. What your heart's willing of o' Cik Wei. Come hurry, I'm heading out in a hurry o' Tuan Wei. Let's! Why'd you poke my behind? -It's you! Why are you in the middle of the way? Can't you walk the other side since I'm here? No, I can't! I'm not used to other ways. What's up? -I'm here with a big matter. The King has summoned you. An important and urgent work. Important work from the king? That's right. -Must I be there now? Yes! Yes, we go now! -Can't it be later? No. It can't. I'll take you there. Come! Let's go together. This is the King's palace. This is where I meet the King. Now, you wait outside. Where? -Wait outside. Be quick. -Sure, I'll seek the King. I'm going to call The King. Your Highness? Your Highness? Im back, Your Highness. Ahh, you're back, Awe. That's right. I'm here, Your Highness. Where's your friend? -He's outside. Call him in. -As you wish. Hey! Come in! The King has summoned you. Can I come in? -Yes, you can. Can I come in now? -Yes, now. Yes, you can. You've called me, Your Highness? Hey! That's my place. This is my place! -Where's mine? Yours is there! Be seated, both of you. Is it that hard to be seated, Awe? Sit, face me. Why is it that you wish to see us, Your Highness? Do command on us your wish, Your Highness! Can I know..... -What are you trying to say? Don't fool around, Awe! Get up! Get up, Awe. Duan, wake up! God, he's bleeding! Duan! Duan, wake up! Mummy! Don't get involved! Duan! One day, we could go to the thrift shop. We will get a sweater. People said, Japan will be cold. I thought you are..... I haven't left yet. I've told you before... ...I will not die, makyung lives in me. I will bequeath the soul of makyung to Salmi... As well as Nancy. I wish makyung will be in everyone hearts. Thank you, Awi,... ...for showing me... ...that its more than meets the eye.
