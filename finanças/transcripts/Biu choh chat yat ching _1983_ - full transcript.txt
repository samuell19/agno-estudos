Thank you Bye-bye Bye-bye Uncle, do you have a nickname? Numb foot I believe in fate If not why would we be together? If there is, why is it like a dagger? The invisible blade pierces the heart But there's no blood Only tears that can't be held back If it is fate... Why is it ordained to failure? If not, why is there bitter love? The bones are filled with sorrow Corroding them gradually But my passion would last forever We part of our own free will But the memory lingers on I'm speechless, and so are you But we know we must part Don't regret or worry about... breaking my heart With time man gets used to solitary life!
