I WAS AN ADVENTURESS. 32. 32, exactly. Really? This vase is modern? 1932? 32 years before Christ. It's a Greek vase. I know nothing about it. I'm a businessman. Waterfall... You know, Waterfall wool... Notice the work of the artist: the delicacy of the joins, the proportions... Sir is an amateur? - I am looking at the women. They are well-rounded. Look at this here. Pity that she is dead. We mustn't forget that the Egyptian line directly inspired the Imperial line. Can't we silence that music? But there is a ball. - A ball, a ball... Why are we giving a ball? Lovely. What charm! What harmony! What radiance! I am very embarrassed. Excuse me, it is I who has reason to be nervous. I am Professor Paulo, of the Royal Academy of Bucharest and I am admiring that exceptional piece that you are wearing with an usual joy. 16th century, isn't it? Yes. At least, yes and no. - I don't understand the "no". It has a history, a very old history. Tell it to me, I am a historian, you know. One of my forebears, Anastasia Vronskaya, had the honour of not displeasing Czar Ivan, who offered her this pendant. 16th century, if I'm not mistaken. Only a little. This jewel is a copy, sir. This marvel is an imitation? Yes. - Incredible. May I examine it? - Of course. Would you help me? So, what's this all about? When my forebear died a long time ago, her great grandnephew, Nicholas Vronsky became the regular visitor of Peter the Great. Every night, he had the privilege to cheat at the Imperial table. Then one day, he had nothing left, except the famous necklace of Anastasia. And he lost everything on a roll of the dice. Because of being overly sentimental, he made a thoughtless error: he made a copy of the jewel and gave it to the Czar in place of the original. Unhappily, he had to admit his trickery to a large gentleman who asked him by shaking in one hand, some pliers and in the other, a red-hot iron. The true jewel was restored to the Imperial treasury, and the fake one decorates, this evening, the neck of a poor exile. It's a small misfortune that can soon be repaired. Look at Rutherford. He wants to compete with you. He has in his hands a magnificent piece. Excuse me one moment. I know someone who isn't going to be bored: the lady who you are going to give this as a gift. Isn't that so? - Will you allow me? This pendant is worth an enormous amount. The stones are splendidly worked. Sir John, I know that you are a great expert on jewels, but you are wrong. That jewel is a fake. I will gladly pay 5000 pounds for my error whenever you like. You know Countess Vronsky? Yes, I've seen her two or three times. She is charming, a little like champagne. Charming and very rich, probably. They say she only keeps them as souvenirs. Beautiful jewels that are in her possession. Excuse me, the countess is looking for me. - Lucky man! Excuse me for having caused you this bother. You find me imaginative, but when I consider these jewels, I see knights, duchesses with their bonnets, Popes with their peplums. I am a bit of an oddball. It bothers me to give you the jewel now. You don't think you can be separated? It's an idea that never occurred to me. Pity. And yet, if they offered you a huge sum... 100 pounds? Why would you... this jewelry isn't worth anything. I know, but for an artist... Help me with the clasp. - Gladly. If you knew what an artist has to suffer... There are two men in me: the businessman and the artist. And it's the artist who's offering you 200 pounds. Careful, you're scratching me. - Sorry. 500? This jewelry is all I have left of my family, of my memories, of my country. We don't sell that for some pounds. You want to dance with me? - Yes. 600 pounds? You'll say that I am mad. No, but I'll think about it. You aren't in your normal state this evening. 800 pounds? But why not 1000 pounds? Tomorrow, you'll have forgotten all about it. But yes, you ought to reflect. I have thought: 1000 pounds. I see that a night's sleep has not brought you back to your senses. But understand me well. It isn't only a question of sentiment, it's also a question of morality. But you are not deceiving anyone. You've said that the jewelry is fake. 1000 pounds. - 1000 pounds? I am sure that you will regret this folly. - Never! But the jewelry is fake, sir, I tell you again. What will people say, when they learn that I sold it to you at the price? But I'm not going to shout it from the rooftops. Nobody will know anything. You don't trust me? - Yes, I trust you. But I ask you to put it in writing that these jewelry is fake. With pleasure. In your manner, my conscience is totally at ease. You are a good Slav: complicated and illogical. A simple formality. Take it. I give it to you. It cost me plenty. You offered me, yesterday evening, 5000 pounds for this piece. Yes, that's the price. - I have a better offer. But as it's you, I'll let you have this marvel at that price. This pendant isn't worth 4 pounds. - What? It's not the same. This one is false. Human greed offers an endless field of action that we should know how to exploit with tact. And with restraint. Restraint is a weakness I know how to maintain. I'd like to remind you that in 8 days, I learnt Greek and Egyptian art from their origins. Sir would be entitled to our praises, if you had not attempted to steal the ambassador's wallet. No... he tried to do that? It's disheartening. I'm restraining myself but it irritates me to the tip of my fingers. One of these days, you are going to ruin us. For you, I think that I'll be able to control myself. Old baby, go on. Enough of your emotions, the train won't wait. At last! I was afraid I'd be too late. It's nice that you came. Madame, my conscience is not at ease. I have deprived you of a jewel that means very much to you. It made you so happy. I didn't want to cause you any pain. Cancel the contract. Too bad for me. Oh no, no, no. Too bad for me. The sacrifice has been made. Don't reopen the wound. It's a fake! - Yes, of course. I bought them for a great deal and the stones have no value. Did you think they had one? But I haven't deceived you. Yes, they are fake. I even think that you confirmed it in writing. You said that it was a keepsake from the last 20 generations. What's done is done. And as you know, the Slavs are complicated and illogical. 16th century, don't forget. Remember the story of Anastasia. You were magnificent, Vera. - I was your pupil. Shame that I wasn't your master. You want me to be your master? You learn fast. - You should do the same. I've told you often enough for it to get into your head. There was a time when the Countess Vera, despite her authentic nobility, would accept the help of a Desormeaux. That way she could be certain of never dying of hunger. You lack some tact. If I accepted, in the past, to follow your suggestions, it was because we agreed that we would never be accompanied by circumstances that I found revolting. Good. Well, no more talk about it. Never again? - Never. You'll allow me to regret it. - Yes, I'll allow you. I'll also allow you to retire. I'll go to Paulo, and play belote... if you'll allow. That's a ravishing woman. A true spring bouquet. You are truly ravishing. A true spring bouquet. That's nice... and unexpected. Since you arrived, I've not had a minute to myself. What are you saying? - I've been thinking of you. It's an exhausting job! - Yes. Especially for me. I have plenty of imagination. I love seeing Vera at work. She is a good performer. Very conscientious. I like distinguished women. Look over there. But she's a prostitute. She's a woman of high society. You are a man like the others. You like to profit from the naivety of a woman alone. It's still a deception for me. And say that this morning, I have already experienced it. Are you disrespectful? I am an old sword-fighting champion. I don't like explosions. You aren't going to find anything like it at a simple jewelers. You see this little brooch? It's not so bad. I maintain that she's a princess. I'm telling you she's a prostitute. You'd bet 100 schillings? - Agreed. How will we find out? - It's not so easy. Look closely. And that awful jeweler had the shame to offer me 10,000 schillings, when it was worth more. All that is sickening. My dear, keep that jewel. My chequebook is at your disposal. I'm not asking for charity. Forgive me, it was my passion. The Koreanis are passionate. What do you want of me? The address of an honest jeweler. I don't want you to be outraged by vile haggling. I work in that business. They can talk to me. Trust that brooch to me. - Gladly. I'll make them choke. - Thank you. Forgive me for doubting you. There are still knights in our day and age. This place is impossible. He put it in the left pocket. - I saw. So? It's done? I don't like that you doubt my abilities. A little jostling, and bingo! And another little jostling, and bingo! It's stronger than me. They have a way of taunting you... He is incurable. I've not had a crisis since the Peruvian ambassador. Take it... your share. That's my share? - The best. It'll bring you luck. When are you seeing the marquis? - Tomorrow. I'm seeing him here, the good marquis. "Dear adorable countess, a disaster". "What has happened, marquis? Have you lost your head?" "No, not my head, countess, the brooch. The brooch you entrusted to me". You're wrong, Vera. My speculations on the vanity of men give much more precise results. I said to him, when putting the brooch on his counter: "I, Marquis of Koreani, do not admit any discussion. Give me 50,000 schillings. He didn't even flinch. - He has no shame. Obviously. Trembling, he opened his cashbox and he gave me the sum. That's amazing. - Here it is. How can I thank you? Your trust is my reward. But what am I seeing? My suitcase. You're leaving? This is a grievous blow. - Isn't it? Destiny is cruel, my poor friend. My cousin Trombolinsky has mumps. It's awful. - It's necessary that I go. But I will return. Soon? - Yes. And you'll write to me? - Yes. Often? - Every day. - Me too. My ring. Bring it to me, and be brave. - I'll try. Ten, black, even and miss. You see? The bank is going to be broken. The waiting is going to break us. It's illogical. All the winning formulas are exhausted when the number that should come out doesn't come out. It's not so serious, I've finished my studies of the fauna of the hotel, and I've selected 4 individuals with whom we can work: the banker Brandes, the American Morrison, the industrialist Glorin, and the miller Vernaren. Now, Vera, they are for you to play. Morrison, Brandes, Glorin, Vernaren. Orchids. Roses. Carnations. Violets from Parma. Not commonplace. More romantic. I'm leaning towards the violets. Madame. - It's about time. I am surprised to find you in the foyer. Usually, you are half an hour late. - Usually, yes. Today, I am 5 minutes early. You mean to say that you are 25 minutes early. Exactly! Ravishing. A true spring bouquet. What do you want? Mineral water and fruit juice. Champagne Mumm 21. Come here. Come to me. The nasty sir will poison you. He is funny! - Yes. You love dogs? - Foxes even more. Tomorrow, you'll find every fox for sale at your place. No, I don't want this. A dog is much too much of an encumberance for me. Then you need a lapdog who makes no noise. That's it. We only need to find one. I'm on the case. You like dancing very much? I hate it. - I would have suspected as much. Tell me, why did you ask me to dance? To hold you in my arms. - Ah, I see. She's beginning to warm up. Perhaps she doesn't want to rush it. She first drowns him in her charm. He's may be a good swimmer. Very nice, your numbers. - Yours, now. I'm going to try. - To you. It's very difficult. I'll start again. - Go on. Poor Vera, the things we make her do! The sleights-of-hand. But it's not all over. She must be called to order. No, I prefer roulette. I prefer golf. It's less expensive. - You've lost much? I don't lose often, but I lose heavily. I am reduced to expedients. - How? Yesterday, I left on the roulette table all that I had brought with me so Im looking to sell a jewel. It's not so bad. It's worth much, this piece? It's valued at 80,000F, but they offered me barely half that. Those negotiations were no fun. I can take it? - I don't want to put you out. It's no bother. - Really? Then I accept. You are very kind. Right pocket. - Seen. So? It's done? It was the man himself that I jostled on the stairs. The jewel case all alone was lifted in my hand. That brute didn't say excuse me. But what's that? It must have been the wrong pocket? Pull yourself together, it's not so bad. Glorin sold the jewel and Desormeaux came up with something else. But I think I've forgotten to tell you... What? The jewel, this time, was just a tiny bit false. It's not true? - Yes, it's true. This was what was allowing us to continue on our winning formula. Leave off with your winning formula. You couldn't care less, you. He'll suspect that I was trying to roll him. Tomorrow morning, our friend will repair his error with his usual dexterity. It's going to be cold: eat. - I'm not hungry. What? Nervous? - You annoy me. Oh, it's you, Paulo. Glorin is at the jeweler's with the fake piece. Bad reaction. Leaving? Leaving is confessing. All the risk in on my head in this case. If it ends up in prison, ultimately, it's not your elite brain that will get me out of it. You are going to see Glorin? Yes, I've arranged a meeting. Don't imagine that you're going. You'll flee. - No. The victim is you. We sold you a fake jewel. He might help you bring about justice. There is no other way. There is no other way. You understand? You are right. I lost my head. It's understandable. The important thing is that one of us three keeps his head, and that will be me. You remember that jeweler I mentioned? Not so good. - "Not good"? So it seems to me, yes. Yes, obviously. I'll try again. Try to do better. You aren't playing well today. Give me the eight-iron. Oh, I forgot, I have it. Take this. - I'm sorry. - No, open it It's useless. I would rather that you check it in front of me. It's a lovely little dog-fox. You are kind. He is very quiet, and doesn't have much of an appetite. Thank you. - It's a lost dog. And where did you find it? In the jeweler's window, where I'd gone with your pendant. How much did they offer you for that jewel? 40,000F. - 40,000F? They were a long way off. You know what they told me? I suspect... He told me 100,000F. I don't understand it. He sold the fake jewel, and gave you... A real cheque... 100,000F. It was an accident, but he acts like an honest man. He has supposed that I am ignorant that the jewel is fake. He took pity on me. Pity? I was not wrong. Violets from Parma, romance... Make us happy one last time with your genius. One last time? I'm getting the train. I don't want to see him again. Madame's pride has been hurt. Yes, my little Desormeaux. Pride is a sentiment that escapes you. He doesn't act proud. It's a question of prudence. You don't want to give the impression that you might be on the run. We will leave today. You can find us in Budapest later. Yes, it's more prudent. I'll stay here a few more days. But I'm not coming to Budapest. Why, I ask you? For a very simple reason: I've had enough. It's over, I'm not playing anymore. It's my fault, I shouldn't have missed it. Everything is broken. I am a greenhorn. What is she going to do without us? The Budapest train is at 8.30pm. We will be at the Hotel Europe. Goodbye, Vera. - Don't be such an idiot. Come and find us. I don't know. 8.30pm. - "8.30pm". And this dirty life continues. For me no more, it's not the ideal. You have an ideal? Poor old thing. A wife and kids, in a little place, with a nice bistro... With the sign "watch out for pickpockets". We don't chose our destinies. - As you say... You're enjoying yourself here? - No. I have something to say to you. I'm listening. - Not here. It's something disagreeable? - Yes, indeed. Where shall we go? - Look. You want to go sailing? - Yes. Let's go out on the sea. You aren't going to throw me in the water? I won the King of Sweden's Cup! That's all that you wanted to say to me? - No. I had enough of seeing you among that crowd of snobs. You wanted to avoid me? I don't want to live like a savage. Imagine if we were two savages on a desert island. Yes. The sea around us as far as the eye can see. Yes, and the rest of the world far away. Unhappily, the rest of the world is waiting for us. And it would be sensible to return. "Sensible" is a type of turn. - What? - It is a manouevre. I want to see how you won the King of Sweden's Cup. It's a tennis cup. You have been sailing before? - No, not at all. It's not important. Port is... - "Port"? Starboard? - I don't know. Which direction is the wind from? - Wait. It is necessary to pull the rigging to the right. I should have pulled the rigging to the left. Your health. - Assassin! And if I couldn't swim, what would you have done? I would have saved you. So it was to win yourself a medal that you dunked me in the water? You wretch. Help me. I'm suffocating. You'll have to die, my friend. I don't want any decorations. Well, look at you! He's lovely. Darling! Sir and madame, you would like a little refreshment? This should make you feel better. You think you'll stay a long time here? Just until our clothes have dried. We are not in any rush. You know, a little water never killed anyone. Despite that, I won't be putting you out the door. Because you're not bothering me. I have something to confess: Vera, I am delighted finally to get to know you. It is today exactly 18 days since I danced with you for the first time. It's 18 days since I first saw in the hotel foyer a ravishing and elegant woman. Straight away, I wanted to know her, speak to her, please her. And since then, I've forgotten about another. Already? The fidelity of men... - Ask me why. No need, I know. Because of me - Yes, because of you. The other was adorable, but articial. This one here is more simple, more true. I will remember that day. A lovely end to the holiday. You aren't still going to be leaving? - Yes. When? Soon? - Tomorrow. Shame. It seemed to me that the Countess Vronsky of Cannes would not have said such a thing, isn't it so? Yes, I think so too. Who is the true Vera, the one of Cannes, or the one I'm seeing at this moment? The true Vera, I prefer that you do not know her. Let's go see if our clothes are dry. Already? That would amaze me. Yes, they are dry. See. Dry? Dry, that? No. Feel the inside. They are still a little cold. We must be careful in the South. - So we must wait a little longer. The evening air will warm them up. Do you know what this is? Take down our clothes, and carry them inside. I told him to bring in the clothes. Put yourself next to the fire. You are cold. See that little sailing boat? It's fantastic! See, it has every little detail. It's an amazing piece of work. Indeed. Look, it has everything: the rigging, the masts... This was made by a real mariner... This scoundrel was putting your clothes in the water. It wasn't on purpose. Wait It's very annoying. He wasn't very adroit, that kid. - Oh yes? What are we going to do? We are going to return to Cannes in these clothes? I can't see myself strolling on the Croisette like this. Yes, of course. Then we must resign ourselves... Resign ourselves to what? - Staying here a little longer. After all, it's not so bad here. No, it is even good. There's no bus to go back. But if you want to stay, we can put you up for one night. You won't be troubling us. Do you have two bedrooms? - Two bedrooms? Oh, these Parisians! It's because my husband is a little bit of a sleepwalker. And my wife's snoring is like thunder. - Poor thing! But you will be nicely installed... just above, there. Don't be deceived. It's all right. The second and the third doors. This is costing you much? - What? The spanking of the poor kid. He told you? - No, I saw for myself. Vera, you forgive me? Does he forgive you? - He does, yes. But you? I do too. It's a frigate. You have made a model. If there's a man equipped to do it, it's me. Heads or tails? Heads. - You lost. Tails. - Run along. Don't sink it like the other one. You are blaming me? - No, no, no. Don't go, don't go. Stay. Stay a few more days. No, darling, it's impossible. It's you that should come with me. Close your eyes, close your eyes. I have a surprise for you. Your engagement gift. I didn't want you to be separated. That evening when you entrusted this to me, I knew this moment would come. I said to myself: "One day, I'll return it to her". And that day has arrived. - You shouldn't have. Vera, have I hurt you? - No, no. I don't understand. Don't force me to explain. You don't love me? My feelings for you are very sweet, very strong. Yes, you have to believe me. But I am very independent and I am not ready for marriage. - But yesterday evening, you... But you are not a child. Words said at certain hours don't have the meaning found in the dictionary. "I love you" when we should say "you please me". And then "love" can signify "caprice" or "adventure". All that depends on the individual. We don't give words the same meaning. Dear Vera, I agree with you. Would you reserve me a sleeping- booth for Budapest? For this evening, yes. I don't want us to part angrily. I want you to understand. I have no reason to be angry with you. We met. We separate. That's life. An adventure, as you say. But it's a small world. It's not impossible that we will meet again one day. So it happens that we do, all the same, we can shake hands. Don't you think? Oh yes, dear madame. You are right. Pierre, don't be mean. Tell me that you don't want me. I don't want us to part in this way. One of my forebears, Anastasia Vronska, had the honour to please Czar Peter. Peter the Great. - Enough! Don't forget that you are a woman of high society. Don't let that out of your mind. No. - Carry on. To you, Paulo. This jewel is ravishing, dear countess. But you don't know. This bracelet is worth nothing. This jewel is worth nothing at all. That's it, at all, at all, at all. No, that's not it. You have already said that all is missing. Cover your legs. - They are ugly? A woman of the world doesn't show them off so generously. It's why those women can sell themselves so dearly. No, but say... - Go on, continue. Listen to me well: the accent, the style... and the flowery language. Shit. - Vera, where are you? You going to throw your Vera in my face again, you two? I'm asking myself where you're going to lead us. 98, 99, 100... 101. Another 123 days to burn. Yes. We'll be in Paris for the Grand Prix. We can stay at the Ritz. Come on, Vera. One more effort. I can't do more. Be brave, Vera, another 100m. And now, finish with a sprint. Bravo. You've covered the distance in 10 seconds less than yesterday. Madame Glorin, a little word for the radio. The spectators are waiting for your impressions. I am very happy to have won over the course. I will try to do better next time and I am very happy to have won over the course. Okay. Now, to the bathroom scales. 800... hurrah! You have lost 300g. I will put them back at once. Your aunt Emilie has asked us to dinner. But she spends her pension on it. Tell her that you take your nutrition from fruit juices and salads. But, my dear, as long as you've known me, which isn't very long, you have totally transformed me. I love the Champs-Elysees at this time of year. Once you've paid for the hotel, it'll leave us with 324F. Give me the receipt. You know that I haven't paid the hotel bill? Yes. - I admire you. How had you worked out that I had put our fortune on Farfadette? She turned out to be an also-ran. But that money was not all yours. Do you know what you are? - A thief. That makes a game of croquet, archery, diabolo. And with this? Give me also the game of society ladies: lotto. I have something else very amusing in the window. I should buy this racing game. We could play it with the hotel manager, it'd soon pay the bill. I am the king of the hill, on the race course. On courses with lead horses. You're right, the bill would be paid. You like it? - Yes, include it too. What a nice surprise! It's a long time since we've seen each other. - A year. It's good to see you again. And the same for me, you know. Shall we talk somewhere else? We can go wherever you like. I should have it all delivered? Yes, it's true. No, I'd prefer to take it with me. But it won't all fit in a car. As you like. - What is the address? I'm at the Hotel de la Concorde. What name? - Lady Kennington. Lady Kennington? That's not bad. Are you coming? As you can see, you are a little responsible for our backwards slide. We're not blaming you. You seem to have been working successfully. I'm coping. It's always the same: lots of stories, worries... Luckily, I remember your lessons. On that subject, dear Vera, you haven't completely paid the price of that good lesson. When we were working together, I would never have believed it, but the circumstances... You appear favourable. - Exactly. And you are in a hurry to present the bill. We aren't personally disturbed, given the importance. Where are you living? Hotel du Canard. - Rue d'Aboukir. I'll come tomorrow for tea. From Ceylon. I won't forget. - Goodbye. I was happy to see her, and you try to get her to pay! Room 228. Shall I announce you? No, thank you. We are expected. I trust her. We could have waited at ours. I also trust Vera. Lady Kennington a little less... It's... it's us. I wanted to wait downstairs. I see that trust reigns! A simple, polite visit. I well recognise my gallant associates wouldn't want to bother me. I'm happy to have the occasion to settle with you. Besides, we can do that very quickly. I have gained 60,000F since I've been in Paris. I owe you, let's say, 20,000F each. Here. - And here's the means for our grand departure for America It's a country with much to offer in your line of work. It's the country that I need. I want to adopt it. There's good service in the hotel? - Yes. They do snacks? - Of course. Do you still have two rooms? Two very nice rooms in the 2nd floor? Good, perfect. Yes, I'm booking them. I'll come down and fill out the paperwork. We have the neighbouring rooms. We are all reunited for a few days. This must please you, doesn't it? - Yes, I'm very happy. For a start, let's have dinner together. The openers are on us. The only thing is, I didn't have any warning. I have a rendez-vous. We'll find you again after dinner. I have a proposal to make to you. I am certain it will interest you. So? Aren't we eating? You know what time it is? 2pm! It may be modern, but it upsets my stomach. If you're so hungry, why don't you nibble a leg? You would have me eat before? - No. Your charming wife hasn't much notion of time, and she is hopeless at bridge. She has other qualities. Forgive me, I ask you to forgive me. I am sorry. Excuse me, aunt. Hello, Pierre. Start without me. Not before time. I'm dying of hunger. What happened? - Many infuriating things. I am most agitated. - Why? Nothing, dear: the dress is a failure. We can't depart tomorrow. But we can go the day after. You can go whenever you like. I'm leaving Saturday, with Edouard. I'm counting on Normandy to improve his anaemia. But where's the mayonnaise? You see this object, insignificant in appearance. A few tweaks... 1, 2, 3, hup! I'm going to produce hundreds of thousands of francs. I'm short of time, explain quickly. You going to start your short report? Soon, Mr. Van Kongen, the well-known gem merchant of Amsterdam, will arrive in Paris with rare pieces for display. He will bring, among others, the famous diamond 'Imperator'... I understand. Yes, yes. My birthday is approaching. You are going to offer me this little stone. Not totally, 30% as usual. But I don't like working in collaboration. But it is another of my plans. Don't insist. If she doesn't want to... She wants to. Blackmail? - An unpleasant word. And if I won't collaborate? I would have to suppose that you have a good reason. A reason so good that I would like to know what it is. You're wasting your time. - Then it's no? It's no to 30%, but for 40%, we can talk. The serial doesn't seem to be holding your attention. I thought at the end, that we will find out in the next episode. It is the story of a woman who, after difficult circumstances, experiences troubled years. One beautiful day, she meets an honest man. She loves him. He loves her, too. He knows nothing of her past. He never asks her. She doesn't tell him. And they married. - And they live happily ever after. One day her accomplices attempted to bring her back to them. Then the woman kills the shadows from her past. Scandal, trial etc. The woman, after much hesitation, told her husband all. I'm up to there. What would you advise the husband to do? I don't know. I am in the process of discovering what's going on in Winnipeg. Leave the fluctuations of the stock market, and answer me. What should the husband do, in your view? Divorce her, of course. - You think? You sympathise with her, that woman who didn't trust her husband? When we love, we conceal nothing. She said nothing because she didn't want to destroy his happiness. All that, it's the sort of thing that happens in fiction. Your writer should have chosen something else. I think so. - And you haven't found anything? Not yet. I want a nice room. - Of course, sir. Conduct sir to 318. I want to deposit something in your safe. We'll accompany you. - This way. That sir is the Marquis de Bourdeville? No, sir, no. It is Mr. Van Kongen of Amsterdam. An amazing resemblance! It's the... I've seen him. Van Kongen of Amsterdam. He has locked his jewels in the safe. How do you hope to obtain them? We need a plan. You don't want anything? Shush, don't say anything. I have an idea. Give me what's in your mouth. No, not like that, in a ball. You don't mind if I don't watch your demonstration? A thousand apologies, but business before everything else. It cost me 7F! - Go to the door. Vera, pay attention. I'm going to show you your work. Van Kongen is there. You are in my place. Imagine that there are more stones like that. Much bigger, obviously. Here is the wax and here is the Imperator. At the opportune moment, call the waiter to remove your plate. When the waiter knocks, you say "enter". Mr. Van Kongen will see the intrusion... - Obviously. During that time, with your index finger, under which you have stuck the gum, you make a natural, delicate gesture. Take the tray. You understand? - Yes, very good. And afterwards? We re-encounter the waiter, and the agile fingers of our friend Paulo will perform the necessary. It's not a new trick, but it gets the job done. I like the classics. - Yes... but the main suspicion is going to fall on me. But they will find no evidence. You won't be nabbed. - And the waiter? They will detain him, then they will let him go. During that time, we will have made our way to New York. It's not bad. Not stupid. I'm interested. But it must be understood that this is the last time we will work together. Afterwards, we're finished. We will say goodbye. - Understood. You are going to get to know Van Kongen? Of course, like usual. It's always a pleasure to work with her. The jeweler has already been slapped in the face. She is admirable. - She is even improving. But I am afraid for her. - Why? Your con is risky. - But not for her. It's a pity, really. I would love to go and see your diamonds at the exposition. It would be a joy to show them to you. But, unhappily, I must depart. - But not this evening! Ah yes. Why not? Let's say now, will you? It's to say... If you will allow me to be so bold, I ask you to come up to my room. You are very nice, but you are embarrassing me a little. You understand why. - Yes. So, then... perhaps you would consent to receive me in your room? Then, at 10pm. - I hear you, at 10pm. Help me, I can't manage my tie. You are dressed? You coming with me. - No, my darling. I'm afraid that I would be an annoyance, at your dinner. But there is a very nice concert, so I will take advantage of that. You should come with me. - No, spare me that chore. It's not so nice, what you said. But you are amazing. Must I always be at your command? Are we having our first scene? This is a little hurtful. Pierre, please forgive me. You don't want me? In the end, I don't want to be another worry that you love, but to make you happy, and to see our happiness last. I have other worries than you, my dear. Until later. Don't be late. I will be back first. Don't worry. Van Kongen is in the room. Stay by the door. - Of course. A small sherry? - No, thank you. Sit down. Here are my little gems. These weigh 9 carats. It is a little more blue. But this is a little toad that needs to be seen with a magnifying glass. And lastly... this one is the most beautiful. A famous specimen. 28 carats. Extra blue-white. Not a single fault. What a marvel! Moreover, this stone has a history that I'll tell you. Here, waiter, please take the tray. Would you like something else? - Yes! Don't move! Raise your hands. Nice trick, but it doesn't work with me. I've done nothing. I am innocent. Turn around! Turn around! Don't move. - I'm innocent. We should go in, break down the door, help Vera. - It's impossible. What's this? Arrest this lovely couple. Their con was a little old. They attached something under my tray. What should I have done? We'll see. Go, on the way! Go, dress yourself. I thought I'd come here to do some legitimate business, and end up with a vamp. Calm down. There's no point in waking the entire hotel. I should have put on gloves to deal with her! I'm going with you to the police station. To police headquarters. All this is your fault. We should go. - Vera won't betray us. But the Parisian police will be sniffing around. Gentlemen, thank you. - You're welcome. The jeweler was perhaps a little too loud, but in the end, it was good enough. So, I should return you the sum? - Yes. I will reimburse my employees myself. Your artists. - Thank you, madame. You want to stop the taxi? - Yes. I am counting on your discretion. You have had your renumeration. At your disposal for: searches, tailing, delicate missions, divorces... Arrange for my baggage to be retrieved from the hotel. Vera has left in the room things that will compromise her? Or us? It's possible. It would be sensible to check. Lady Kennington doesn't have much to take with her. What are you trying to say? The Imperator. - Show me. I give it to you. So, Van Kongen is a swindler. She has played us like school-children. It's a triumph. We must go and retrieve her. I'll give her 50%. But that 50% isn't coming out of my share. What's happened? - I've twisted my ankle. Wait, I'll fix it. Let go of me! Pierre, will you let go of me! Let me take care of you. I'm going to nurse you. Give it to me, cousin. Give me that weapon. Edouard, what are you doing, with those arrows that could hurt you? I'm teaching a group archery. A boy who hasn't picked up a weapon for 25 years. You are mad! You are right, aunt. I need you for bridge. You play bridge? - No! Of course. Come on, my child. Are there any bridge players here? - No! Here are the new invitees. Have we found Mr. Glorin's? Yes, I am his aunt. Count Nicholas Vronsky. Colonel Petrov. I am the cousin of your nephew's wife. Do you play bridge? - Yes, but... You'd rather play archery? May I introduce my son. Edouard, say hello. - Hello, gentlemen. Here is the family on your wife's side. These gentlemen have just arrived. Do you know them? No. - Let me introduce you... I warn you that they will not be playing archery. Come and play, come and play. Two glasses of gin. A glass of sherry. Hup! And then... and then, oh, I don't know anymore. Add a little of this. Because it's a small old world, dear cousin. Chance brings us together. Vera has never spoken of you. She may have believed that I was dead. Cousin Vera, I am so happy to see you again. May I introduce to you Colonel Petrov? Delighted. Stop that, I need you for my bridge game. Straight away, or after dinner? - Before and after. You are staying for dinner? - We have already unloaded our baggage. I am looking after them for the weekend. You must have so many things to tell us. Here is your room. Here is the wash basin. What do you want here? To see you. You want to unpack the trunk? The pleasantries have gone on long enough. How much will it take for you to go? We're in no hurry. - I'm very comfortable here. Would you hand me my trousers? The con with Van Kongen was first class! But you were not careful enough with your technique. The Imperator was childlike: a ball of lustre. The empty wardrobes, the empty cases, these are unworthy of my pupil. So I made a few inquiries, and here we are. I will give you 20,000F to leave immediately. These questions of money are, between us, shameful. These small amounts... - I haven't another penny. And this house? It must be worth nearly 2 million. We have always split things in three. In this case, it would be better if you addressed this directly to my husband. It would make things easier. - Yes, it is perhaps a solution. For you, it would be the best? - And for you? We are going totally crazy. Stay calm, cold-blooded. Believe me, we should go. - No. We will find another solution. But... - I have an idea already. Remember the words of Sieyes, that he made in the Revolution of 1793. "I have lived". So have I. I am not a red. I am even more not a white. I would rather be, as I say, a rose. Ultimately, a moderate. Just like a pale rose. I think that he is a little odd, your friend. It's to say... he has been trepanned twice. It was perhaps not so well done. - That's it. Like on the Volga! - Don't drink any more. I am a Colonel. I'll drink as much as I like. You have many samples of that sort in the Vronsky family? He is amusing, isn't he? - Yes, a little special. It seems to me that I have seen him somewhere before. You think so? - I'm certain of it. Those nights of thunderstorms with my regiment camping in the Carpathians. Were you wounded? - Wounded three times, yes. One here... one here... one here. Exactly there. We are waiting for bridge. One moment, while I finish my trick. And here's your card! - No. What are you up to? - Some conjuring. No, enough messing about. We play, we play. Just a small round. - Of cards? No, something more original. I need two accomplices. Our little Edouard and my cousin. Little Edouard on the stool. You aren't going to do something wicked? Ladies and gentlemen, nothing in the hands, no trickery, nothing in the pockets. You wish to check? - NO! Then I will start. What did you say my dear? - Shut up! Gently, I get vertigo. Edoaurd, have you lost something? What? I don't believe so. Mummy! They have taken my wallet with all my secrets. Stay calm, all will be restored. And here is the wallet of cousin Edouard! She is adorable. A real spring bouquet. I now know where it was that I've seen you before. In Cannes. - In Cannes? Impossible, I have never been there. You are the most dexterous woman I have ever encountered. I'm delighted to have entertained you. It's so apparent that you are part of Vera's family. Really, you are the living picture of your uncle. My uncle? - Yes, Vera's father. That poor Serge who died on the Volga. - Yes, it was most sad. Look... the same head shape, the same eyes. Yes, those really are my eyes. A little less lively, perhaps. - Yes. I have good news. You're leaving? - Yes. I don't like to rock the boat. You had many illusions. - Perhaps. I will take only some little souvenirs. What are you trying to say? There are 3M worth of jewels here that don't beong to your relations. You wouldn't do that? You will not be involved at all in this operation. But if we are discovered, it won't go well for you. At least, almost as much as for me. So I am sure of your discretion. Vera finds this very amusing. Your cousin resembles perfectly the picture of your father. He has had a little too much to drink, as you can well see. No, but your husband was pulling my leg, so I responded to him tit-for-tat. You think that I know your father? But he didn't always have a hairstyle like that. Well then, no bridge! A wasted evening. Edouard, it's passed your bedtime. Mother, please, I am not a child. How's that? I don't have a child anymore? You disgust me. Sorry about the wallet. I am in a small crisis. The jewels that you've seen here have rendered you mad. What jewels? Desormeaux has said nothing to me. Listen Paulo, we have always been friends. Why do you want to do me wrong? - It's not the case. I didn't want to come here, but he made me. You know what he's like, impossible to resist. Well, Vera, we are going to bed. Breakfast tomorrow morning is at 8am, and at 8.30 we're leaving to go fishing. A small word of advice: there is a burglar in the area. There's no need to be alarmed. If any of you wish to be careful, I have a safe in my bedroom. Vera, don'talk like that. You will give me palpitations. Lock all the doors! I'll give you my jewelry. - Me as well. You can deposit all you want with me. She is fantastic. - You are right. And I well know it. She is reacting in just the way I expected. What's that? - She's making our task easier. You, in your role of Cousin Nicolas, will go through every room collecting every jewel that is going to reside in the safe of your cousin. During that time, I will see Glorin and Vera. Move yourself. I would prefer to kill you. - Go on. You will find our jewelry? - Yes, get it ready. I'm not acting against Vera. We didn't come here for us to go soft, but to work. I am disgusted with myself for not smacking you in the gob. Move, go to say good night. Since you are going to protect the jewelry of your guests, would you allow me to entrust this little piece to you. It was given to me in the past, in Vienna, by an exceptional woman. - Really? Afterwards, I understood that I'd had an affair with an adventuress. My cousin has asked me to collect the objects that you wish to deposit in the safe. My wife has it all ready. Give me your jewelry, darling. Here you are, sir. Thank you. - It's me who should thank you. You had had a life of adventures. I travel a lot, so I'm likely to meet all sorts. Have you travelled much? - Yes, a lot. Have you visited Budapest? - Most definitely, yes. I was there for a year. It's a very peaceful place, very hospitable, that I liked very much. I am very pleased that you are doing this. I don't have so much trust in women. Bird-brains! Who is that man? He's Colonel Petrov, dear. I don't like that sort, with their air of irony. Are you jealous? It's more serious than that. What are these men doing here? Shut up, back. I want to know. - I will explain to you. Firstly, I must collect the jewelry. That's necessary, indeed. Meet me back here. I'm glad it's you. I forgot my earrings. But you are wearing them, aunt. Exactly. I forgot to give them to Nicolas. What? - I've already given him the rest. He is collecting them from all the guests which does not please me so much. Obviously. I understand well enough. He's very friendly, your cousin. - Yes, good night. But what's all this? Listen, Pierre.. - Speak, please. They have stolen... - What? They have stolen all the jewelry. All the jewelry, Pierre. They are chasing us. - They won't catch us. The petrol! That's it, it's all over. I think there's a garage about 1km away. That evening when, I don't know if you remember, I'd started to tell you the story of a bad serial. It was the story of a woman who had terrible circumstances, really terrible, that had brought her very low. That woman, Pierre, is me. And those two men were my accomplices. One day, I met you. I loved you. You don't want to know how I wrested against this love. I struggled as long as I could. I tried everything. I lied to you. That evening, I wanted to tell you everything but I felt that I would lose you. I didn't want to lose you. I'm going to look for the petrol. And what are we going to do now? The New York boat departs tomorrow at 6pm. Wake me at 10.30am. A hot chocolate and 2 croissants. Yes. You want us to stop. You think that Vera is going to let us go with her guests' jewelry? She has certainly confessed to her husband. I have had a small taste of prison. If they arrest us, Vera will have to be as well. You are a bastard. - No morality, old chum. Vera has always been loyal to us. We should have left her in peace. We need money. Stealing from others, okay, that's exciting. But not her. Why? - You disgust me. You also want to become honest? There are some things which cannot be. You want to leave me in peace and go to sleep? I am going to hand myself in to the police, the guilty will then be caught and the jewelry returned. Pierre, what are we going to do now? If they aren't arrested, how are we going to recover the jewelry? If they are arrested, you are doomed. - Me, you know... You mustn't think of reimbursing them: it would ruin you. It's not that, it's more serious. - I know. There is your reputation. There is yours. What are you going to tell them? That they have been robbed and we have been chasing them all night. Let me do it. Whose is the diamond brooch? Whose is this diamond bracelet? This pretty watch? And this large, yellow solitaire? Here, I'm still left with a brooch. This is Madame's, I believe. - It is indeed. Is anyone missing anything? And my earrings? You didn't entrust them to me. - I know. I'm starving. Where have you been? We'll explain to her later. Vera, little cousin, I was worried about you. Thank you, old friend. You are a brave sort. You doubted me? - No, but I was starting to. You want some coffee or some chocolate? I'm not hungry. I bet that those two were heading for a casino. We happened to get lost, so that lost her appetite. By the way, what have you done with my earrings? I bet that she played them and she has lost them. Nicolas, I would give anything not to have entrusted them to her. Your earrings are in the bedroom. Paulo, in the past, you told me of your ideal: a little bistro in some nice quiet place. We can arrange this. I didn't think it would be possible. - Yes. No, I don't trust myself. Small crises tend to follow me. Excuse me, I have been invited for a hot chocolate. If ever things get tough, think of me. I hope that I will never need you. What are you going to say to Desormeaux? Don't worry, I have a plan. The jewelry! I'm supposed to believe that you pulled that trick to feed the fishes? I'm going to kill you. - Bad idea. We are okay. We are left without a penny. We still have a little something left. - What? My wallet!
