This cash register is available. This cash register is available. Hello? Must have some fruits and vegetables as well. That will be 287. Would you like the receipt? - Hard-on here yes. - We are from the police for sexual misconduct. The fat bastard has been staring at my boobs for two years now! - Are you going home to enjoy yourself now? - Are you Captain Cock? Let me out Are you deaf? He asked if you use Captain Cock as nick? Don't you think we're monitoring your internet traffic? - You are a perverted pig. - Fat pigs like you should be at home. - You are a fucking disgrace! - Should we take the evil at the root? No! Rino? Hanssen? What are you doing in there? Hanssen! Rino-boy! Did you get stuck in the doorframe? - Hello, fuck boy. - Hey. What's up, Hanssen? - No... - Not much? That figures. Aren't you gonna ask how it was in Spain? It was totally sick, man. I had to cool down my cock between the battles. - It was fuckorama. - Weren't you on asthma trip? Asthma ladies are the most underfucked in the whole world. Their husbands are afraid they will get seizure and die. They are absolutely desperate. If I were you, I would never fuck an asthma lady. Why not? They've got so much mucus in the chest, that their pussies are completely dry. Damn. One of the ladies I fucked was 53. It's a fact! It was totally psycho. I was supposed to share an apartment with a guy named Kim. But Kim turned out to be a woman. And it was okay for her. We would have separate rooms, and she had a son my age. And then I thought: "She is over 50 and not particularly good looking either. " But you know, a pussy in the house is a pussy in the house. It is scientifically proved that if a man and a woman live together long enough, - - they will always end up sleeping together. In our case it took two days. The "pussy in the house"-theory. It doesn't matter if she is 12 or 80. And you know what the best was? Her last name was Larsen. You know, Kim Larsen. I have fucked Kim Larsen for 14 days. Do you know who Kim Larsen is? Ok, so shut up then. That will be 300 pesetas, guys. - 300? We agreed on 150. - 150 per person. - No, not for this trip. - My friend here isn't entirely well in the head. He's called Rino. He looks and behaves like a rhinoceros. Rhinos are fucking unpredictable animals. They can suddenly snap, you know! Ok, then you can exit the car. Have a nice party, boys. Holy shit, damn losers. [Speaking german] The Dremel, yes? I will send it to you by next Thursday. It is good. Thank you very much. Send me a final e-mail if there's something new. Ok, great. Bye. Rino? Rino? Are you home? Rino? - Hey, kiddo. - Hey, dad. How are you? I was working a little, and didn't hear the doorbell. - We thought we'd pop by, you know. - Yes. Helene and I will rent out the vacant room. - In your house? - No, here. But I'm the one living here. The vacant room isn't vacant. It is my office. It has not happened much here since grandma died, you know. So Helene thought about renting it out. And I also think that's a good idea. - She will move in on Sunday. - She? Yes, her name is Malin. She's swedish. That will be very nice. You can't mean this? By the way, i've become a super member of AAA. They sent me two reflective vests, so I thought you wanted one. Give that one to daddy. We'll have big brother clean up and move out of the office by sunday? Is that a deal? Let's say that. What's that? Yuck. Bye. - Is she any good looking? - Who? It has happened one interesting thing in your life the last 15 years. Is she any good looking? I don't know. She moves into the day. - How old is she? - 19 or 20 years. It is totally sick, man. Yes, it looks quite promising for me. - Your Pussy in the house-theory. - What about it? If a man and a woman live together for a long time, - - It is inevitable that they'll eventually sleep together. You are so fucking funny, Rino. You should be a comedian. Are you looking at me? No! - Hello. My name is Malin. - Yes. My name is Rino. - Rino? - Rino Hanssen - Nice. - Yes. - It is a nice apartment. - Yes. Thank you. - There is plenty of space. - Yes. - What are you doing? - Now? - Right now... - I mean, what do you work with? Oh, yes. I translate from German to English. Are you a professor? No, I'm not. I only have a home office. Here? So you can do what you want, and... Exactly. Then I can be my own boss and can do whatever I want. And you? I'm trying to get things in order. So I moved from Sweden to Norway. I will shape up. Get things in order. I've gotten a job at a restaurant. I will do it right, study design, - - Not spend money, no parties, no drugs. Absolutely no boys. Just eat, sleep and work. Order of things. - It can not be so difficult? - No. - No, wouldn't think so. - I have already begun. See here. That one is mine, and you can have the other three. And the depotisum is on it's way. - Dep... - The depotisum. - Oh yes. - It's on it's way. I need to go. I can't get late for my first day at work. - No, things in order. - Yes, things in order. See you. Bye. - There it is. - Bye. - I'll just get my towel. - Nice apartment. - Where's your room mate's room? - In there. No, don't go in there - How is he? - A little creepy. - What do you mean by that? - A little strange. A little strange? Oh check this! He's got lots of porn under the drawers. Check this out: "Stretched and satisfied, anal or nothing" - It's Swedish, you can take it. - Oh, thanks. "May-Britt from H?nefoss will never get enough dick". Oh, May-Britt. Let's go. - Where is the toilet? - In there. In here? - It's occupied! - Ah. Oops. He's at home. Rino? - We'll go to the beach. - Nice to meet you, Rino. Hi. Shouldn't we meet properly? It got a little strange last time. - This is Synn?ve, who I work with. - Synn?ve. Nice to meet you. - Come and sit down. - Yes, sit here. Come on. Rino. Just sit down. - Did you buy pizza? - Yes, help yourself. Oh, so delicious. Malin tells me you know German. - Will you teach us something? - I don't know what that would be. Something that is good for a girl to know to if she is in Germany. No, I don't know what would be. What time is it? - Out with your cock, you dirty sailor. - I know you have one. A really kinky one. There are no dirty sailors in Germany, because they're all very clean. What are you watching? A documentary about fat people talking about how great sex they have. Holy shit. This is too sick for me. - Excuse me. - We are very tired. We have been in the sun all day. Come and sit down again. No, I have to work anyway. But we're going to a party tonight. Do you want to come? No, I have a deadline tomorrow, so... - What about your pizza? - I'm actually not hungry. Oh, God! Close your eyes. - No. - Yes. - Come on, close your eyes. - No. Do as I say. Don't you trust me? No. - Do as I say. Close your eyes. - Why? Jesus. Are you a Christian, or what? Now you're going to feel something you've never felt before. Stretch your fingers. Say hello to the Flesh Light. The number one male self-gratification product in the world, man. I got ten of them from a friend. Fell off a truck or something. You'll get it for a thousand. What you can't get, you'll have to buy. It is perfect. You can even remove the inside. I'm only trying to help you. You don't have to pay me right away. - Jesus. It is the wrong way. - What are you arguing about? - Hello. - Hello. El Fillipo. Hi. My name is Magnus. Are you the one living here? Is that a Flesh Light? Can i see? - It's a sailor's bride. - It's Filip's. - The male dildo. Fat. Cool. - Filip brought it. Is that what it is? Canned pussy? So this is the gift from my best friend? I have diabetes, allergies and asthma, but I don't really need one of those things. - But it was you who brought it. - Happy birthday. This joke is at my expense. But it is not fucking funny! - I'll leave, so you can laugh. - Take it with you. - What is it with you? - Nice to meet you. - I don't put my dick in a thermos! - What is it with you? I'm just trying to help you. You want her out, don't you? No one wants to live with a pervert selling sailor brides. Thanks a lot for your help. Just take it and leave. I have to go clean up this mess. Sorry about that. It's Filip... It's his kind of humor. Holy shit. I am not like that. - And how are you? - I'm completely normal. Completely normal. - How boring. - Yes, right? I found a lot of egg and bacon. Want something? No thanks. THINK ABOUT IT - FILIP When you receive your Flesh Light, it will come in a discrete, unmarked box. Remove the product from the box and remove the lid. And then you're ready for the world's leading product for masculine self-satisfaction. Oh yes, yes! Holy shit. Mr. John Holmes! How are you? Have you been test driving your Flesh Light yet? With that equipment you'd blow up the whole fucking thermos. I have to sit down. I've just fucked, so i'm squirting everywhere. Malin is just so fucking hot. No limitations. She's in on anything. Especially when she drinks. Shit, I'm hung over. My God. Can't you put some plastic over your old cheese in the fridge? My panties smells like ridder cheese. Smell. It's disgusting! Can't you put it on the balcony or something? - Why do you keep your panties in the fridge? - What? You can't even say depositum (deposit). - What did you say? - You say depotisum. It's not called depotisum, it's called depositum. What the fuck? It's a "sum", not a "tum". It is called depositum. Want to look it up in the dictionary? You and that northerner having sex all the time, so it's impossible to get some sleep here. - Are you listening, or what? - No! Yes, you are listening to us. You can move out from here. We're not fit to live together. I am not a collective-type. - What do you mean? - Don't you understand norwegian, or what? - You fucking... - Fucking what? - No, i'm actually going to save it. - Say it. - Fucking... - Fucking Swedish mother fucker. - Vary good, Rino. Say it again. - What? - Swedish mother fucker. - What are you saying? Are you sick or what? - Come on then. - What's wrong with you, pussy? - What did you say? - Pussy. - Good. Again. Louder. - Yes. Pussy! - Louder! - Pussy! Pussy, you are a fucking pussy! - Rino? - Yes? Come out. You two have gotten to know eachother, I see. I was just picking up the deep frier. Are you okay? It's good. I'll leave now. Bye. Bye. Do they have only one dog, or is there more? This is dog number two. The first died in 96, i think. Then they made a movie about Rex when he was little. And they could use that dog when he grew up in this season. Is there a movie too? Yes, it was that year's big hit in Austria. "Baby-Rex, Der Kleine Kommisar". - You're kidding. - No. It's so sexy with men with lots of knowledge. Anyone can find that on the Internet. Professor baby-Rex. You're a lot the web, I understand? Yes. Wikipedia. Malin? Rino? Do you want to fuck her? Don't think of it any more. You know that I can give you all the pleasures you desire. I know you, my big delicious boy. My pussy will always be there for you. Wet, safe, warm and delicious. Come on, get on with it. Come on, Rino. Rino Rino - How's your wife? - She is actually quite ok. - Is she quite ok now? - Yes. Have you had "the good conversation" yet? It wasn't her I was thinking of. - You owe me money. - For what? If you haven't used it yet, I can take it back. Yes... You've used it, haven't you? You've fucking used it! And then you've fallen in love with your room mate. - This looks like a triangle drama. - I'm not in love. Hi. We're just grabbing some wine. We're going to the park. - Are you having a band-rehearsal? - No. - Do you get a lot of gigs? - Gigs? - Do you want to come with us? - Yes, perhaps we should? Then you could play a little for us. We could use an entertainer. - We have other plans. - What other plans do you have? - We're not going to the park. - Ok, bye then. Yes, enjoy yourselves. Bye. It's completely sick. You have to be a member, but I know a guy. It's no second hand store. It's fresh food from Estonia, Lithuania, Gambia. And of course, Troms county. Tiny, tight sami girls. Can you shut up? We've heard you talk about prostitutes for 15 minutes now. Prostitutes are nice. Want to come to Rino's apartment? - We have cold beers and... - Can you pull over here? - Stop. - We are only halfway. - We're 18 years old. - Happy birthday! Stop! I have stopped. Bye, girls. - I'm sorry. I'll leave now too. I've got something that needs to be translated by tomorrow. Ok. You're going to the park, aren't you? - I didn't plan on it, no. - Yeah, right. Talk to you later. Bye. Hey, Rino. You're going to the douchebags. Rino, no matter what you are doing, you're making a fool of yourself. - You're making a fool of yourself! - Bye, Filip. Fatso Rino Hey! Is that the one you talked about earlier, Malin? Hello. Are you the one who's a professor in German? - Where is the charm troll? - He had to leave. So i figured i'd drop by and see if you had any fun. We do! Don't we? - Tell a little about your job. - Yes, do that. - Yes, tell. - It is not very exciting. I translate tool manuals from German to Norwegian. Far out, man. What kind of tools? Abrasive tools, sanders, drills... And hedge cutters. What are you doing now? I'm gonna start on this one. A multi sander. It's for cutting things with, and you can replace it. What is the largest you have translated? Have you for example translated a cement mixer? No, I have never translated anything over 32 kilograms. But I've made up a word that didn't exist in Norwegian. It was some kind of small lever - - attached to some kind of machine. It was called "Scht?rkn?bel" in German. - And what did you call it? - Styrknabel. - Did you come up with that all by yourself? - Yes. Rino, we will be having a party on Sunday. Housewarming party for Malin. At your place. - Okay, okay. - Is it okay? You can bring your cute buddy. What is he called? - Filip. - Bring Filip. - Yes, Filip will come. - That's good. You're going to excercise, i see. Need help? - No, I'm only browsing. - Are you browsing for anything in particular? - Jogging shoes. - Jogging shoes aren't just jogging shoes. It is extremely important to find the right shoes. Especially when you have a little weight. It is important to take care of knees and joints when you are heavy. This one. These are good, sturdy shoes. Want to try it? This is going to be hell with your basis. You've got many long and hard workouts in front of you. But that's good. You have to start somewhere. Jump up on the treadmill and run a little for me? I'll just take them. I think they were cool. I have to check your pronation. The pressure. How you run. We'll increase the pace a bit. Want me to turn it off? Careful... Stop! You can watch, but in Pimplona the Fatsos must be on the sideline. Rino. Come here. Malin Malin, check this out. What do you think, what is the dress code? I don't know. Casual. Casual? - Do you think many will come? - I think there will be a lot, yes. Maybe we should have a doorman. It would be the city's coolest club with bar, - - DJ table, disco lights and stuff. And with a doorman. Have you ever been to a party? No, never. Of course I have. - Where are your glasses? - Contact lenses. You look nice. But you seem as if you're going to a funeral. We'll open this, and open up there. Ok, that casual. Tonight we'll get drunk, right? - Hello. - Hi, Mathias. Did you arrive now? Are you flirting with my girlfriend? Sorry, I didn't know you had a boyfriend. - What does that mean? - "What do you mean?" - Who are you? - Yes, who am I? - Want to dance? - Yes. Bye. - Do you think I'm just inventing it? - I know it's just something you're inventing. Nostradamus wrote about this 500 years ago, the yellow danger. Hi. It is the Scht?rkn?bel. Come here. I would like to say on behalf of everyone that this is a fabulous party. - Go ahead. - No thanks. I don't smoke hashish. Hashish? This is pot. No, I'm only going to get stone drunk. Sit down and relax. We're here if there's anything. If you read a little and keep up with things, and been a little enlightened. For example, I read the financial pages every day. While you are stoned. What are you reading then? Jack Kerouac, and High Times? Why are you sitting here? Are you feeling sad? Yes, you are. I can feel it. Don't be... Don't be sad. - I'm not sad. - It's party now. Don't be sad. Do you know? After you moved in, my life has been completely crazy. You are so quiet and safe. Now I want to see you dance. Come on, professor. Look at fuck boy. Hi. I just got home, and Malin had a party. Sure. Did you join Extreme Makeover, or what? - I want the gay-look special. - Hello. There's the entertainer. - Do you want a beer? - I thought I'd fry some bacon. What's going on? Talking about how sad it was that you missed the hippie ages? - What the hell are you doing? - I wanted to fry some bacon. Isn't that awesome, or is it too hillbilly for you? Doesn't it fit to your diet? Why are you so pissed off? Been a while since you've gotten anything? Shut up, damn waitress! Oh wow, angry boy. I know what you need, Filip. You need a proper blow job, so you can lower your shoulders a bit. - Are you good at blowing? - Fuckin' good, actually. How do you like it? Thrusting your dick far down her throat? Or do you like that she's just nibbling carefully at the tip? Did you have a cold beer? - Here's your buddy for a party... - Can you just leave? How is it, then, Loverboy? You are more interested in Rino. Is that what it is? Ok, I'll leave! Let me take a look at your cock, entertainer. - Look at that one. - There! Come and get a taste. Malin, your buddy puked. - Jesus. Rino! - Check out the huge dick. Help me to put on his underpants. Jesus, he's got a hard-on. - I just have to touch it. - Don't! He won't notice it. He's sleeping. I'm drowning! Rino... Hello! Rino. We're going to the beach. Here's something for you. Enjoy. - Did you know about this? - Didn't you know he had a kid? No! He's fucking married to that old bitch over there. They've been on and off for a long time. Relax, it doesn't mean anything. Take it easy, Malin. You are much better than her. - Are you okay? - No, i'm not okay. And it won't go too well for me either. Not when you're as stupid as I am. - You are not stupid. That's why I do everything wrong. That's why everything is wrong, because I am so hopeless. But you're only 20 years. You have a lot of time to fix up things. - But it's not getting any better, is it? - Yes. - Look at yourself. Is it going to get better? - No, not for me. - But you are pretty and fun. - It's not what I need. I don't think pretty and fun sound too bad. - Is that the only thing about me? - No. No! What else? You are kind, and... No, not reliable. But you are good to party. And drink. And to stay up late at night. And you smell good. - Do you know what I think? - No. Dear, Honorable Professor. You need a girlfriend. You need to fuck. And I need to stop fucking. Forever. From now on I'll enter celibacy. - And you will exit one, ok? - Yes. - I can arrange a date. - With whom? - Now you're interested. - But who is it? - No, it is a blind date. - No! Not a blind date. You need a girlfriend. You deserve it. - Cheers. - Yeah, Cheers. Is there a carnival? Party for Carlings employees? Where are you going? Rino, don't be so cranky. I drank a couple of beers too much that night. Get in, I'll drive you where you're going. I'm going to meet a woman. No, are you kidding? Are you going to a date? That's awesome, Rino! Who is it? Good luck, Rino Call me tomorrow. - Hey. - Hey. Hey. So you are Swedish too? That's a nice dress. Thank you. That's a great... Nice wholeness. Goes well with your hair and everything. - Sorry, but I'm waiting for someone. - You don't have to wait any more. Rino. Rino? - I am Nina. - Oh yes. - Do you know each other? - No. We just chatted. I need to go to the bathroom. I'm just going to the toilet. They've got a lot of good food. Have you decided? What wrong with you? What is the thing here? That fat people must hang together? Don't you know that people make fun of you behind your back? You should stay at home and eat the fat food which - You - and put your fat on the couch. Holy shit. Hey. Were you going to check if the Fatsos found each other? How did it go? Do you think that you can match people only because they are fat? - What do you mean to match? - Match! You are so fuckin disrespectful. Just walking around in your panties and complain about how hung over you are. And that idiot you're dating, eating all my food. And you're feeling sorry for yourself because you are so pretty? You can just leave. I don't want you here. Don't you understand? Are you that stupid? Get out, and drink and do drugs. Fuck some guy who doesn't even care about you. And you can find some other fat fuck you can cry to in the morning. Leave. Do you think i should be ashamed of myself? I'd fuck you so fuckin' hard. I'd fuck you, and all your friends, and the woman with a suitcase full of dildos. Look how cute it is. Imagine if we were to do the same. - Can it handle all the sperm? - Yes, it has a small pocket that can be emptied. So here you can eat your eggs. Oh, Captain Cock Are you sitting here and being ashamed of yourselves? There's a bunch of ladies in the floor under here that needs dick. Go and fuck. Claim your right! Now! - Hey. - Hello. - What's up, Hanssen? - I'm coming with you... Cool. Welcome aboard. ...to a whorehouse. Whorehouse? What are you going to do there? Fuck prostitutes. You said if don't have it, i have to buy it. So I'll buy it. - I'm not in the shape today. - I thought that's how you got in shape. - What's wrong with you? - You don't even know where it is, do you? - Of course. I know the guys. - Then, let's go. Okay, if it is that important to you. - Yes? What do we do now? - Take a cold beer. - That's not what I meant. - First we'll look. We need to get in the mood, damn it. Look at the woman. I don't know what it is with me and strippers. They are so attracted to me. I promise you. I've never paid for a lap dance. The lady, Kim Larsen, you know? Her daughter is a stripper. But she strip mostly outside Norway. Mostly the Las Vegas area. And she's got a lot of hair on her pussy. Holy shit, you are so full of shit. Can't we just drink some beers and look at the ladies? You don't even know where we are. What kind of place is this? This isn't exactly a regular bridge club. It's not like going to the store to buy bread. We talk about prostitutes, right? You don't know where it is. Can't you just admit it? - Yes? - Hey, it is Rino. - Hey, Rino. It has been a long time ago. - I'm gonna send up a buddy. - That's nice. Just came on in. - Ok. Here you go. You're not coming? There you are. Come in. What do you want? - Beer, vodka... - No thanks.

But she is getting some food, so you can't pick her. And here we have Nikita, and she is kinky. She can be a very enjoyable experience for the first time. I think I will take that beer anyway. It is your decision. Now you can talk to the girls and select one. And we'll settle the bill when you leave. Enjoy. - Hello, Big boy. - Hello. - Hello, come closer. - Yes. Don't be shy, it's just sex. - Are you afraid? - No. - Would you like to have sex? - Yes. - Do you like Nikita? - Yes. - Do you want to have sex with me? - Yes. Do you like sex, big boy? Come, we go private. Come, big boy. I must leave now. Thank you. Rino. Now I've done it again, you know? Magnus, he doesn't want to see me any more. He moved in with his ex. I'm drunk.

I want to feel your big, big cock inside me. Yes, yes! Yes, Rino! Fuck me, harder! Continue, Rino I love you! What the fuck? Are you jerking off? What the hell are you doing? - You said you wanted me here. - So that means you can jerk off? That's disgusting. Did you think I wanted to have sex with you, or what? Did you think I wanted anything to do with you at all? You're so disgusting. You're a fat, old, ugly, nasty porn-pig! Go jerk off somewhere else. Leave! What are you doing? Since I'm so disgusting, I'd better just cut off my dick, or what? That's good. Just do it. - I'm gonna do it. - So do it then. Do it now. - Yes, but you can't watch. - Yes, I want to watch. Let me see if you can take some responsibility. Do it then! Leave. Rino! What the fuck did you do? Rino, wake up! Wake up, Rino! - Hello. How's it going here? - Good.

I need the name of your next of kin. Set your mom. You can set me. It was Rino Hanssen? - Hanssen with two S . - Ok. That's fine. How are you? 1 cm further down, and there wouldn't have been any "sausage" left. - Does it hurt? - Yes The worst is that the doctor has prohibited sex for four weeks, so ... So what shall I do then? I found your drawings You really see others. And yourself. The drawings are very good. Sick, but good. Just like you. I think you should send them. Are you going to leave? - I am going home to my mom. - Why? Where my mother live, it's so fucking boring. I thought I would try to be by myself. Alone. Can't you stay here and be bored with me? I can teach you everything about it. No, Rino. Do you know why? Come here. You're not going to sit in here with me. You need to get out of here. Do you understand?

You are very cute. Thank you. Would you like to go on a date? No, just a cup of coffee or something? Or to the movies or a date? - I am actually engaged. - Sorry. I didn't know. - Congratulations. - Thank you. And if you weren't engaged? It's charming when someone thinks I'm cute in this shirt. And you seem as a nice guy, so ... - Why not? - Yes, why not? - bye - bye
