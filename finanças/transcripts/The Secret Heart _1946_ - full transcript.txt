Man: Keep the change, Matey. Aye, aye, admiral. Yes. I'll have Mrs. Addams call you as soon as she gets in. Hi! Chase! Hi, honey. You're home. I can't believe it. I can't believe it myself. I believe it now, though. Oh, chase. Did you miss me? We all have. Ha ha ha! See? Steamboat! Hiya, steamboat. Hello, steamer, you little, old scotchman. How are you? Heh heh heh. Hey, where's Lee? She's out. I hardly ever see your mother anymore. How is she? Oh, chase, you'll be so proud of her. Lee's one of the biggest real estate operators in New York now. Well, find her, woman. Get on the horn. Let's have a celebration. I don't come home from the Navy every day of the year. Who's that? Penny. What's she doing home from school? She didn't go back after easter vacation. Why not? She's worse, chase, much worse. She hardly ever talks to Lee or anybody anymore. She shuts herself up in there and plays the piano... Hour after hour. Well, there's nothing new about that. But now if anybody walks in, she stops cold. Sometimes, it's frightening. I kind of hoped now that she's grown up, she'd... I'm going up and see her. Oh, no, chase. I wouldn't... Not while she's playing. Listen, she's my sister. I think maybe I can handle her. Penny! Chase! Oh, you're back! It looks like it, doesn't it? To stay? Yup. Take your last look at my blues. Oh... How are you, beautiful? Oh, I'm all right. How come you're not in school? Oh, well, uh... I couldn't go back to school. Why not? Oh, it's nothing. It's... It's about my heart. What's the matter with your heart? Did somebody get it? It's nothing, really. Hey, come on now. Play some more for me, will you? I didn't know you were so good. Does, uh, Lee know you're home? No... Kay's downstairs trying to find her now. Kay doesn't know where she is. Oh? But I do. Well, for heavens' sakes, where? She's with Dr. Rossiger. She's not sick, is she? Oh, no. It's not about herself. It's about me. You? Dr. Rossiger is my psychiatrist. Your psychiatrist? Yes, mine. But that doesn't keep our stepmother from going to see him behind my back. "Our stepmother." Oh, penny, are you still saying that? Well, she is our stepmother. So what? I'm sorry. Let's call her. Butterfield 8-1598. Yes, lieutenant. Mrs. Addams is in with the doctor now, but I'll see that she gets your message. Yes. Good-bye. Come in. Well, Mrs. Addams? I was just thinking, Dr. Rossiger, if you hadn't become a psychiatrist, you'd have been a wonderful prosecuting attorney. Huh? You have a talent for phrasing the most loathsome accusations in such a way- accusations? Well, you did call me a liar. Oh, no, no, no. I- I just said you hadn't told me the whole truth. Now, if we're going to help penny, we must be absolutely honest. Uh, there are several important facts that I know nothing about. Penny is vague about them, and you're evasive. You have a farm in new england, haven't you? What about it? You've never even mentioned it to me. Penny has spoken of it once in a while. It evidently means something to her, but what does it mean to you? Well, it... it's a lovely place. Why don't you ever go there? Oh, I'm a busy woman, doctor. I haven't-i haven't had the time. Your children have time. Why haven't you let them go? We can't ever go back to the farm. I won't even talk about it. Mrs. Addams, what are you afraid of? I'm not your patient, doctor. Oh, yes you are my patient, Mrs. Addams. You became my patient the moment you placed your stepdaughter in my charge. Now, how can you expect me to understand penny if I don't understand you, too. And how can I understand you if you don't tell me everything? Mrs. Addams, believe me, I'm trying to be your friend. But if you choose to treat me like an enemy, mmm... Oh, I'm sorry. Well. So, let's see, what do we know? We know that when penny was 5 years old, you married her father. And we know that 2 years later, he... he died. Well, now, those 2 years those are the years that I must know about. I believe that penny told me her first recollection of you was coming down a gangplank off a boat. What boat was that, Mrs. Addams, and where had you been? And where were you going? Yes, I was on my way back from england to marry Larry Addams. Christopher Matthews was on the same boat. Chris was an old friend of Larry's. I had heard a lot about him. Somehow, we'd never met. Larry wired him to look me up. Oh. ...with the ship, so to speak. You got a wire, too, then, huh? Well, let's meet and have a drink. ...not feeling very chipper. Oh, no, no, not a carnation. Some other fellow might be wearing a carnation. I'll tell you, I'll be wearing a Rose, sort of, oh, a salmon pink-mmm! With large thorns. Yeah. Stormy weather, old boy. Huh? My wife won't like that. Hell-oh! Oh, excuse me! I didn't mean to throw myself at you. If you're really leola waring, it's quite all right. I am. Uh, man with Rose with thorns. Uh-huh. Ah! Oh! Hold it! Look. Let's sit down and go at this a little more gracefully. Ahh! Oh! Ha ha! Did I hurt you? No! Ha ha ha! Oh, I have an idea we're going to be well-acquainted before this storm's over. Well, I hope so. I, uh, ordered for you. Is that all right? Fine, thank you. You have to when you can, you know. Most of these glasses are broken. Uh-huh. Excuse me. You, uh, see what I mean? Uh-huh. You-you won't get seasick, will you? No, you don't have a thing to worry about. You know, you've got the nicest laugh. Ha ha-ah! Excuse me! Ha ha ha! The next 5 days went by so quickly. And as we neared the end of the voyage, it seemed as though I had known Chris Matthews all my life. New York's in the morning. You live right in the city, don't you? Mm-hmm. I live in Providence. It's, uh, only an hour by air from New York, half a minute by telephone. Uh, do you like to sail? Mm-hmm. Oh, that's great. Did I tell you that I built the Valerie ii? She's entered in the Bermuda race next season, and, well, some skippers are superstitious about having women on board, but I'm not. Uh... do you like to fish? Mm-hmm. You know, I've got a little farm in Rhode Island and about a mile away, there's a stream with a granddaddy trout in it that long, and, well, I - I thought that, uh, together, we might, uh... Lee... These liners travel so fast. That's why I like sails. This is our last night. We dock in the morning. And I just want you to know- Chris... I'm in love with Larry Addams. I don't believe it. I know I should have told you in the beginning, but it seemed such a lot to tell, and it wasn't only my secret. It was Larry's, too. Months ago, he asked me to marry him. I wanted to terribly, but my aunt... Well, Larry was drinking then. She took me back to england with her. You see, she lives there, and she's sort of my guardian. But she promised that if I still felt the same way after a few months in england, I could come back and... And... you think you still feel the same? I know I do. But aren't you taking on an awful lot? A widower and 2 young children? I worship the children and- oh, Lee, are you sure? Tomorrow, when I see Larry, I'll be sure. Won't I? You'll have to answer that yourself. I'll never forget the look on Chris' face the day I was married. And I remember the glimpse I caught of penny. She looked sad and resentful. All that summer at Larry's farm, I did what I could to win her confidence. I remember one day, I had planned a picnic. Well, here we are. Everything ready? We got the ice cream, Mrs. Stover. Well, that's just fine. We got the ice cream. And I've got fried chicken and sandwiches and fruit and cookies. That's wonderful. It's a mighty fine day for a picnic. Is Mr. Addams ready? I'll go get daddy. Uh, no, penny. Uh, I think you better go inside. But I want to. No, no. Darling, you stay here with chase and watch the ice cream, hmm? Somebody might take it away. Sure. We'll watch the ice cream. We'll watch the ice cream. Darling, if I were the usual wife, I'd say, isn't it a little early on a Saturday morning for this, Mr. Addams? If you were the usual wife, you wouldn't be Mrs. Addams, Mrs. Addams. I've been looking for you. What for? This. Oh, you're a lazy thing. Look at that. Pajamas in the parlor, no breakfast, and the children expecting us to go on a picnic at banning's point. I'm on my honeymoon. Where are you? Honeymoon. Then keep your mind on it, darling. Now. May I sell you on the idea of banning's point? No. Oh... I'm afraid Mr. Addams has lost his youth. Larry, I hate to break a promise to the children. I didn't promise. But I did. Did you marry me or my children? All of you. I'm glad you love my kids, Lee, but, please, dear, keep most of your love for me. All right, dear. I'll take the children on the picnic. I'll say you're not well. Oh, but please, don't drink anymore now, hmm? Eat something instead. Never tell Mr. Addams what to do and what not to do, Mrs. Addams. Larry, please. Daddy! You promised to bring daddy to the picnic. You promised! Why do you keep him here? Daddy isn't feeling well, darling. He can't go with us this morning. What do you mean I can't go? Of course daddy's going, beautiful. He just overslept. That was only the beginning. And one night, a year later, when we were going to a dinner party with Chris Matthews... Larry, you're not dressed! I know it. But, darling, it's late now, and here you sit playing the piano as though- I didn't know my playing annoyed you. I won't bother you with it again. Larry, don't. I only meant it's time to leave. I'm not going. Daddy and I were playing a duet. Apparently, we were committing a crime, penny. Lee doesn't like our music. Penny, you should have been in bed ages ago. Now you've made daddy cry. Oh, daddy's tired, that's all. Now... the sooner you get to bed, the sooner tomorrow will come and then another piano lesson. Say good night to daddy. Good night, daddy. Good night, beautiful. Good night, penny. Good night. Larry, what is it? What is what? I'm not going. That's simple to understand, isn't it? But it's bill and Nancy's anniversary. They especially wanted us. They're friends! I see bill every day at the bank. I'm very friendly. Isn't that enough? He bores me. His friends bore me. I'm not going. What'll I tell them? Tell them... Larry's drunk. Oh, I forgot. You don't like my music. I love your music. Hmm! Oh, darling, tell me. What's wrong? Why is it you think something's wrong? Why do you keep nagging, nagging, nagging? Oh, you poor darling. You had a bad day at the bank, didn't you? I'll tell you what. I'll cook dinner, just the 2 of us, hmm? There's loads of things in the ice box. What do you say? So kind, so brave, so long-suffering. Why don't you let me alone? No, Larry, don't. I'm tired, I tell you. I'm getting tired of your watching, spying, counting my drinks... Tired of you, Lee. Go on. Go to your dinner. Get out! I have every intention of getting out. I'm going to that party, and I'll have the time of my life. From now on, you won't be bothered by my suffering or my bravery or-or my spying. I'm going to have fun. If I can't have it with you, I'll have it without you. Hello there. Larry's not going with us, Chris. Do you mind taking me? No, no, of course not. Go on. Take her. You can both discuss me behind my back. Tell her how sorry you are for her. Oh, shut up, Larry. Get out, both of you. Get out and let me alone! Chris, take me back. I have a feeling that i- now, now, Lee. Better let him sleep it off. In the morning, if he remembers it, he'll feel sorry. If he's forgotten it, well, you'll forget it, too. Huh? Maybe you're right. : Frankly, it's beyond me why George bothered to marry her, unless, of course, he needs her money. Is it true she's filthy rich? - Filthy. Of course, Louise and Fred were supposed to be just good friends. But it does seem odd that they got married so soon after Walter's death, doesn't it? Wait till the case of darley vs. Darley comes up. Honey, that's really going to be a stink. Can't keep a cat in a bird sanctuary. And I don't care if it's siamese or Swedish. Oh! Oh, and what about Hazel, remember? Oh, yes. "Oh, my dear, whosit's wife can't have been seen with so-and-so's husband, "because so-and-so's husband was last seen in kokomo with whatsisname's ex-wife-" "... who promises to tell everything." Gosh, how those vultures eat up scandal. What's this? Roadhouse. Now, Christopher... Now, leola. Come on. * each time I say your name * * you came and fanned the flame * * and it will burn * * we'll re-begin love's charms * * when I am in your arms * * no one will do * * no one till you * * return * There you are. I am very thirsty. Just a little. Just a little. There you are. Thank you. Are you going to eat that sausage? Why? Do you want it? Madly. Well, if I'd have known, I'd have had it wrapped as a gift. Ha ha ha! I love gifts! You know, I almost got you one the other day. Mmm? Well, there was a sort of a-a fluffy thing, a- a negligee, I guess you'd call it. I saw it on a dummy in a store window in Providence, and it looked exactly like you. The dummy? Yes. No, no, the-the negligee. Anyway, I was tempted to buy it. Well, why didn't you? Well, it was one of those women's stores, and I've never been in a place like that in my life. Ho ho ho! Oh, Chris, look. Huh. Well, what about it? It's time to go home. Have you forgotten that awful party? All forgotten. Had fun? Ah, yes. Then it's time to go home. I wonder what's happened. Something up at the point. Let's see. You wait here. I'll see what it is. Hello, sheriff. Hello, Mr. Matthews. What-what happened? Larry Addams. Larry Addams?! There's been - there's been some sort of an accident. Chris! What is it? It's bad, Lee. But what? Sheriff, what is it? Mrs. Addams, we've been looking for you ever since you left the mosbys at 10:00. I'm sorry. It's your husband- we found his body at the foot of the cliff. No. Larry? Somehow, we managed to keep the children from knowing the truth. We let them believe their father died of a heart attack. Put the bag in the car, darling. Penny, darling, it's time to go. Hello, Mrs. Stover. Is, uh-oh. I'm glad you came, Chris. Is there anything I can do? Thanks. Mrs. Stover's staying on. I've rented the house. But I don't even know where you're going. Y- y-you can't just go. I'm going to New York to get a job. I'm going to pay back every cent that... Larry lost. Lee, I know this is not the time to say it, but nothing has changed for me since the taurania. I think it is the time to say it. It was 2 years ago on the taurania, I fell in love with you. I didn't know it then, but Larry must have known. Larry? Not that I was in love with you, that I wasn't his, really... Not completely. If I had been, he would have turned to me before... But he didn't. I was afraid you'd try to blame yourself. I'm not talking of blame, Chris. Lee, how can you make plans when you're so confused? I'm not confused. I've never seen so clearly in my whole life. Believe me, I - I'm not being hysterical. I'm not being melodramatic. I just know that if I had been everything a man has a right to expect his wife to be, those children would still have their father. Look, Lee... I'm in this, too. Now, there must be something I can do. Yes, there is. Don't try to see me, please. Don't even write. If you'll promise me that, then I know I can go through with everything. All right, Lee. Good-bye. Good-bye. And that was the last time you saw Christopher Matthews? Yes. Why? Larry's suicide, the bank investigation caused a horrible scandal. I couldn't do anything about that. But all the cruel gossip about Chris and me, I thought- I thought that if- you thought that if you ran away and let that child believe that lie, that everything would be all right. Well, what would you have had me do? Tell the child her father didn't die of a heart attack, that he, that- now, Mrs. Addams, let's not talk about what you might have done. Let's talk about what you're going to do now. What am I going to do? You're going to reopen the farm. You're going up there for the summer. No! That's impossible! The whole neighborhood knows. People would talk. Not if you talk first. Up at the farm, little by little, things will come back to penny. The house itself will have memories for her. Perhaps, she'll begin to ask questions, and you'll give her the answers-true answers! And then? Then her heart trouble will be cured. But there's nothing wrong with her heart. All the specialists have told- ah, heart specialists can't cure a neurosis. Don't you understand? Penny's in love with the memory of her father. She's in love with a ghost, which means she's on the brink of disaster. If she isn't able to transfer her attachment to someone real, to someone living, someone her own age, she'll become a permanently sick girl without any hope of having a normal life. Well, Mrs. Addams? What about the farm? Oh, I don't know. This is all so new to me. How'd you like to talk it over with this fella? It's chase! He's home! Oh, isn't that wonderful? How long since you've seen him? 3 long years. Ha ha ha! I bet he'd like a summer in the country. Mrs. Addams, this affects him, too. Why don't you take them both back, face this as a family? If one limb of a tree goes bad and it isn't treated properly, the disease may eventually reach the roots. Thank you. Oh, one more thing, Mrs. Addams. Let penny devote all the time she wants to her music. It's a wonderful outlet and be grateful for it. Hey, Lee, what do you think you're doing? Darning. Darning? Well, look, I don't want to hurt your feelings, but when you darn, you just don't sew the hole together. You don't? Nah, it's one of the first things you learn in the Navy. Look. Here's how you do it. See? Oh, that's beautiful. Nothin' to it. Oh, dear. Somehow, I always felt you wanted a mother who could darn. I always wanted exactly what I've got. Thank you. Sir. Heh! Uh, doing anything special tomorrow, Lee? No. Why? I'd sort of like to borrow the car if you're not going to use it. Oh, sure. Help yourself. I have to go up to Providence. Why Providence? Secret? No, I got to see a guy about a job. Oh, really, chase? A good one? It's with a shipbuilding firm. Well, that sounds promising. Lee, I won't take the job if you don't like the idea. Why shouldn't I like it? It's with the horton shipyards. Oh, I see. Chris Matthews. Yeah, that's right. Chris Matthews. Mm-hmm. He's, uh, he's president of the horton shipyards now, isn't he? Yeah, a real big shot. I ran into him just before I shipped overseas. I recognized him right away, of course, but he didn't know me until I told him. He was very nice. Asked about you, too. Anyway, he offered me a job when I got out. What do you think? Why, take it. Are you sure? Chase, Chris Matthews was your father's dearest friend. I know. The reason I haven't seen him for 10 years... Is my own. Penny still thinks dad died of a heart attack, doesn't she? And you? I was 11 years old. I could read the papers. Well, that's strange. You've never mentioned it. Why should I? There might have been some questions you wanted to ask. I've never questioned you from the first day I knew you. Thanks, fella. Funny kid. Lee, maybe it would do her a lot of good if she did know the truth. That's what Dr. Rossiger said. Dr. Rossiger? Oh, yes, the psychiatrist. What's he want you to do? Reopen the farm. Open the farm? Oh, no, Lee. You wouldn't want to do that. Why not? Well, up there, everybody knows. People might talk. Not if I talk first. Am I interrupting anything? Heck, no. Come on in. Stretch out. We were just gabbing. But you both look as though you- what were you gabbing about? About spending the summer at the farm. Going back to the farm? Would you like that, penny? Oh, more than anything in the world. But, Lee- I, uh, was just wondering. Could Kay come along, too? Well, I don't see how I could do without her. Oh, wonderful! If I get that job in Providence I could commute every day. I was thinking of that. Hey, beautiful, want to take a ride with me tomorrow? A ride? Where to? Got to go up to Providence, see a man about a job. And I got a shipmate I want you to meet. Been bragging about you to him for months. Brandy Reynolds. No, chase, it's-it's so far. I don't think so. Why not? Oh, why don't you go, penny? It might be fun. Sure. I suppose you told him to ask me. Nope. He thought it up all by himself. You thought it would be good for me to go out and meet people. Isn't that it? Look, kid, we don't mind that chip on your shoulder, but don't put a halo around it. You could even bring Brandon down to the farm if you like him. He wouldn't like me. Why not, for crying out loud? Boys don't, that's all. Oh, what's the use of being a raving, tearing beauty if you want to spend the rest of your life locked up in a room with a piano? You don't understand. Who says I don't? Why don't you cut out this phoney stuff about playing alone. Please, i- what's the idea? I was playing for my father. What? Penny, darling, it's all right for you to practice, because your father would have liked you to be good at your music. But you can't just shut away your talent inside of you like that. My father gave me whatever talent I have. It's my only way of saying thank you. Oh, fine talk. She just isn't making any sense. Let's forget it for now, chase. Now what about this trip to Providence, hmm? Yeah, what do you say, beautiful? Want to come along? You'll meet Chris Matthews, too. Who? A very fine fella. Going to give me a job. You remember him, don't you? He was your father's dearest friend. Oh. All right, chase. I'll go. That-a girl! Hello, Mr. Wiggins. Mr. Matthews would like you to come up to his office, please. Yes, sir? Uh, I beg your pardon, but I'm looking for chase Addams. My name is Reynolds. Brandon Reynolds. He's in with Mr. Matthews. Won't you be seated? Oh. All right. Thanks. Say, I know you! You're-you're penny Addams. I'm Brandon Reynolds. Yes. How do you do? Hey, you ought to get yourself a new picture taken. I beg your pardon? Oh, I mean the one that chase carries around with him is downright libel. Why, you're- you're beautiful! Oh, well, really, it's quite an old picture. Oh, really? Yes. Hi, Brandy. Oh, hi, chase. Hey, I got the job. Swell. Oh, that's wonderful. Well, I see you two have met already. Oh, yes. Come on in. I want you to meet Chris. Come on. Chris, this is penny. Well, well, hello, penny. How do you do, Mr. Matthews? And this is a friend of mine, Brandon Reynolds. How are you? Fine, thank you, sir. What do you mean, Mr. Matthews? You used to call me Chris. Not-not uncle Chris, mind you, but just plain Chris. Oh. How do you do, Chris? Heh heh. Remember me? Well, I think so. Of course I do. I'm afraid I wouldn't recognize you. Not now. You've grown so much. Sit down there, penny. This is quite a place you've got here, Mr. Matthews. We do a little bit of work now and then. Hey, Chris. That's the Valerie ii, isn't it? Yeah. She's just been honorably discharged from the Navy, too, chase. Oh. Penny, are we neglecting you? Oh, no. Hello? Mr. Wiggins is here. Have him come in, will you, please? Brandon, chase is going to have a look around the yard. Would you care to go along? Oh, yes, sir. How about you, penny? You like boats, penny? Oh, I'm crazy about boats. You are? Why, of course I am. Sent for me, boss? Oh, wiggins, would you show my young friends, please, around the yard? Mr. Chase Addams here is going to work with us. How are you, Mr. Wiggins? Pleased to meet you, Mr. Addams. My sister, miss Addams and Mr. Reynolds. How do you do? How do you do, Mr. Wiggins? Chris, I don't know how to thank you. I'll see you in a couple of weeks. Why don't you all stay and have dinner with me? Oh, I think that would be a wonderful idea. Don't you, chase? Well, yes. Here's something that will interest you, this tennis cup. It took your daddy and me 3 years to lift the mortgage on that one. Oh, uh, there's your daddy and me when they presented us with that cup. Did you always know my father, Chris? When you were little boys, I mean. I didn't come to Providence until I was 14. There you are. Thank you. When you got to Harvard, you saw him all the time, didn't you? The lot of my time at Harvard was spent waiting on tables. Here, Brandy. - Oh, thank you. How's it going? He's licking the tar out of me. But after you made a success in business, did you then decide- it's very obvious, beautiful, that you weren't brought up in a pool hall. Oh, excuse me. Did I do something I shouldn't? You certainly did not. You stick around, and maybe I'll win. Well, I'll put this back. Here you are, chase. Thanks, Chris. Say, I'm afraid we're going to have to start thinking about going after this game. Why don't you wait awhile? This storm may let up. It looks like it's getting worse if anything. Oh! I don't want to go out in that. I'm frightened. Thunderstorms have always frightened me. Since when? Always. Ever since I can remember. You know that, chase. Oh, my heart's just beating so fast. Look, why don't you all stay here tonight and drive down in the daylight? But I told Lee we'd be back tonight. Oh, we could phone her. That's right, and I could talk with her myself. Oh, but we couldn't put you through all that trouble, Chris. Oh, it's no trouble. I've got guest toothbrushes- anything you need. Oh, uh, how about you, admiral? Oh, thanks, sir, but I've got to get back to the base. Uh, what's the-the number? Murray hill 5-6097. Hey, she's ok. Told you so, didn't I? Yeah, but she's hardly looked at me all evening long. Can't a girl be subtle if she wants to? Yeah. Operator will call us back. That's nice of you, Chris. Nonsense! I don't like storms myself. And now, we, two, who are interested in stimulating conversation rather than low games, will leave you. Come along, penny. You belong in the drawing room. I hope I have one. Did my father come here often? Oh, no. I didn't have this house then. At that time, I - say, I've got something here I think you'd be interested in. It's an album of snapshots taken around your grandfather's swimming pool. I got my start in life there playing tennis at his place on sundays. Good old Mr. Horton. He owned the shipyard then, you know? No, it's not here. I guess it's out at the farm at uxbridge. Oh, we have a farm at uxbridge, too. Just 5 minutes from my place. We're going to be there this summer. Really? Maybe we'll see each other then, huh? Maybe. Well, what do you know? She's playing. My gosh. Sounds like she's played before. Your shot, Brandy. Oh. Your father used to play that. Yes, I know. He was good, wasn't he? He was more than good. He had a feeling for music that was... was rare. Never should have become a banker. Why did he? That was your grandfather's wish. Your grandfather was a very practical man. And, oh, well, I guess, he didn't understand that Larry probably was a genius. Am I at all like my father? Uh... very. That'll be Lee. Hello? Yes. Hello? Hello! Hello, Lee! Oh... hello, Chris. Yes, it has been a long time. Well, that's very kind of you. Won't they be an awful lot of trouble? No, of course I don't mind. Mm-hmm. The farm? Well, next month, I hope. It all depends on how soon I can get it ready. Yes, Chris. Of course you can, anytime. Yes. It'll be nice to see you, too, Chris. Thank you so much for calling. Good night. Steamboat! Ha ha! Well, it seems we're going to the country. Do you think we can take it? Ha ha ha! Steamboat, what's the matter? Oh, it's those geese again. Poor little city dog. The wilds of Rhode Island are too much for him. Go on, Brandon. Hmm? You were saying girls are funny. Oh. Oh, yeah. Girls of penny's age, for instance. For instance? Yeah. Now, they don't come right out and say they like somebody. They've got to act as if he didn't exist. They've got to pretend like they like somebody else, don't they? Well, I don't know. You're telling me. Oh, why do women have to be complicated? Hey, don't play so rough. Ha ha ha! I'm sorry. I... ha ha! Now, you take penny, for instance. Yeah, for instance. Yeah, yeah, yeah, for instance. Now, if she really liked somebody, she'd go out of her way to act like she didn't, wouldn't she? Mm-hmm. I mean, even if, uh, that somebody liked her, too. Or would she? Oh, that's too complicated for me. Yeah. Well, of course, I was only talking for instance. Oh, sure. Hi! Hey, Lee, penny drove all the way over from Mrs. Stover's. Well, good girl! How do, Mrs. Addams? Hello, Mrs. Stover. Sure seems like old times having you back. I'm so glad to see you! You look wonderful! You haven't changed a bit. Pshaw! You've changed a mite, though. You're better looking. Did you get my rat cheese? I sure did. Ooh! Come on, Brandon. Time for a cold drink. Will you make us one of your fruit punches chase told me about? I sure will if you've got the fixings. Oh, we've got everything. Come on, Mrs. Stover. I'm going to carry you across the threshold. Oh, don't you dare! They only do that to brides! You're better than a bride. You can cook. Oh, penny, penny, would you like to take a walk or something? Oh, no, thank you, Brandy. I don't feel very well. I- I think... Not just now. Sure. Hello, operator? I'd like the phone number for Christopher Matthews' farm, please. Dreaming about me or a couple of other guys? Mind your own business. Oh, the conceit of the man. My gosh! Well, I didn't know we were so dressy at the old homestead. Oh, I had to change my clothes anyway. It's lovely, penny. It's a knockout! Boy, it's easy to see why they call you beautiful, beautiful. Oh, well, it's not new. I've just never worn it before. Well, aren't you all going to change pretty soon? Change? Why, this is my favorite sweater. But, Lee, the pants- now, look, we're on a vacation. I'll be clean by dinnertime. Beyond that, I promise nothing. Chris Matthews is coming over. What? Yes, he phoned. I- I was just walking through the hall and the phone rang, and it was Chris, and he said could he come over, and I said, well, yes, of course, and I asked him if he'd like to stay for dinner. But we're hardly settled. You'd better tell Mrs. Stover right away. All right. I don't even know what we have. Oh, he said he'd take potluck. Gosh, I'm a mess. Yeah, me, too. Better scrub some of this paint off. Come on, kids. Leave us Don our festive raiment. Be it black tie or tails? I don't think that's a bit funny. Well... all right. Let's take a bath. Lee, it's 5:30. Thanks, darling. It's him. Yes, she plays just like him, Mrs. Stover. Took a might of doin' comin' back, Mrs. Addams. Oh. I always meant to come back sometime. Took a might of doin'. Hello there. Oh! Remember me? Oh, hello, Chris! For heavens' sakes, just look at me! No, I mean don't. We were painting the pumphouse this afternoon, and I didn't know it was this late. Hello, Chris. Oh, hello, penny. Lee... Oh, yes, darling. You entertain Chris while I clean up. Will you stay for dinner? Why, I believe I was invited. Oh, of course! Uh, tell Mrs. Stover. I did when you told me to before. Oh, of course you did, darling. Well, good - I'll be right back. Same old leola. Ha ha ha! Leola? Nobody ever calls her that. Huh? I do, Penelope. Well, come on now. Entertain me. Oh. Well, uh... Have you been to the duck pond? Not-not in years. Oh, would you like to see the ducks? I'd love to. Oh, well. Come on. The pond's old, but the ducks are new. Do you like old things or new best? Uh, old, I think. Me, too. Well, here we are. Very lovely. We call this duck pond walk. Well, that's short and to the point, isn't it? It always reminds me of 2 nice walks at school. One is through a cool ravine with-with a brook and tall birch trees. That's where you walk with your sweetheart. Oh, yes. And then, the other one is-is through a formal garden and at the end, there's a summerhouse, and the hill drops away, and you look over a lovely valley. That's where you walk with your father when he comes to visit you, you know. I see. Penny! Oh, penny! I won't answer. Why not? Well, boys frighten me. Oh, that's nonsense. No, they frighten me. Really they do. That's because you haven't met the right one. How will I know when I do? Oh, as a matter of fact, you'll fall in love. How will I know? You'll know. How? Well, there are 3 things you cannot hide: Love, smoke, and a man riding on a camel. Remember that now? Love... Uh-huh. Smoke... Smoke... What's the third one? Ha ha ha! And a man riding on a camel. That's it. Shall we see if Lee's ready? Yes. Do you mind if I smoke my pipe? Mm-mm. Oh, let me fill it for you. Well... No, come on. Don't pack it too tight, will ya? No. Excuse me. No, no, no, no, no! Don't pack it so- now, will you leave me alone? I'm very good at this. Yeah. I fixed chase's pipe once. I washed them all out with soap. Oh, fine. I hope he fixed you. Ha ha ha! Not dancing, darling? Well, I'd like to dance. How about it, Chris? Hmm? Oh, no, Chris doesn't want to dance. Look how comfortable he is. Will I do? Oh, of course, Brandy. Ah, put him down. Oh, yeah. Done a swell job with them, Lee. Thanks. He's a nice boy, that Brandon. Seems ok. I think he likes penny. He was so funny this afternoon. Lee... there's so much we have to talk about, couldn't we, uh... Let's watch the kids, shall we? Right. Hey, wait a minute. That was a gyp. Hey, put on another record, will you, chase? Coming up. Oh, no, Brandy. I don't think I'd better dance anymore. Don't you feel well, penny? I'm all right. Really, I am. Would you like to dance, Mrs. Addams? No, thank you, Brandy. Well, I could put on a waltz. What did you say? I said I could put on a waltz. Chris, did you hear what the man said? A waltz! Gosh, Mrs. Addams- that's what he said, a waltz! Do I look like the waltz period? I suppose you'd like me to wear a lavender shawl and bifocals. But, honest, Mrs. Addams, I was- you did say a waltz, didn't you? Did you ever hear of the big apple? Sure. * I can't give you anything but love, baby * * that's the only thing I've plenty of, baby * remember, Chris? Oh, Lee, that's great! Come on! Do it! Oh, come on, Chris. Get in there. Faster! Look at the man go! Look at the man go! Oh, that's fine! That's it! Come on, Chris! Get going there! I never saw anything so silly in all my life. Penny! Lee, you're just making yourself ridiculous and... and cheap. Penny! Heh. Well, I didn't realize it was that bad. Gee, I thought you were just wonderful. You bet she was. Hey, let's have an encore. Come on. Oh, no, Chris. The show's over. Well, anyway, it's way past a farmer's bedtime at that. Can I drive you home, Chris? No, I believe I'll walk. I need the exercise. Good night, Kay. - Good night. Good night, chase. Good night, Chris. Brandon, good night. Good night, Chris. Lee. I'll walk aways with you. Fine. Come on, kids. Let's get a cool drink. Chris... Huh? Don't think too badly of penny. Of course not. All kids get funny notions sometimes. You know, parents can be awfully embarrassing when you're only 17. But she's never done anything just like this before. It's got me worried. Oh, come on. Now, there's nothing to worry about. Perhaps, I should talk to her doctor tomorrow. I've got to go into town anyway to see culligan. Culligan? Business. But what about your vacation? Oh, I'll take it. I- I can't pass up the culligan deal. It's important. Oh, gosh, Lee. It's good to have you back. That's your cue. What? I said, "it's good to have you back." You're supposed to say, "it's good to be back." I'm not sure. Oh, Lee! Where are the cokes? I'll be right there. Couldn't you just holler where they are? Oh, Lee- no, Chris, this doesn't make sense. You-you can't span 10 years in 2 short hours. My job isn't done, not by a long shot. You saw that tonight. I saw tonight that penny has a problem, but it's not yours anymore. Don't be like chanticleer. Chanticleer? Chanticleer was a rooster, crowed every morning to make the sun come up. At least, he thought he did. Then one morning, he forgot to crow. And believe it or not, the sun came up all by itself, a nice, big, bright, warm sun. And poor old chanticleer was out of a job. I'm not like that. Yes, we all are, more or less, sometimes. Hey, Lee! You want us to die of thirst? Did you look in the ice box? Ha ha ha! No. Just a suggestion. Anyway, tomorrow's another day. Please, Chris, not tomorrow. I'm so terribly confused. Perhaps, we shouldn't see each other. Perhaps- Mrs. Addams, I'm a neighbor. I was born neighborly, and I shall remain neighborly to the end. Good night, Lee. Good night. Chris! Chris! It's me! Penny! Penny! What on earth are you doing up here on banning's point? Oh, I-I always come up here when I'm in trouble. What's troubling you? I make people unhappy. Like tonight, I hurt people, and... Then I'm unhappy, too. That's why I-I like to be alone so much. That's why I come up here. But it's a bad place, penny. It's cold, and the wind blows in from the sea, it's- oh, no. It's beautiful! My father used to bring us out here on picnics. And sometimes, very early in the morning, he'd get me out of bed, and-and we'd come up here, the two of us, just to watch the sun rise. Tell me, penny-uh, come on over here and sit down for a minute. You can't actually remember your father, can you, penny? Oh, it isn't exactly remember. You and other people think about my father as-as gone, but he isn't gone, not for me. I can still see him just as he was that last night. He and Lee were going out to dinner, but... daddy didn't go. He wasn't feeling very well. I could tell by the way he was playing. Lee sent me to bed, but I couldn't go to sleep. Something made me get out of bed. Ready? Penny, my little penny... Love me always... No matter what happens, no matter what they tell you. Keep on loving me and playing for me. As long as you live, play for me, penny. I'll always play for you, daddy, only for you. Of course you will, darling. Good night. Good night, daddy. Keep on playing, daddy, until I go to sleep. You see, they don't understand when I say I'm playing for him. But you understand, don't you, Chris? Of course I do. Oh, about tonight, when-when Lee was dancing, I'm so ashamed of the way I acted. Now, you and I are friends, and friends don't have to explain anything to each other. I don't want to be a problem, Chris. I don't want to make trouble. Hey, now, now, wait a minute. Wait a minute. It's not as bad as all that. Here. Go on. Blow on it. Good, hard blow. That's a girl. There you are. I'm all right now. Fit as a fiddle again? Fit as a fiddle. Come on, then. I'm going to walk you home, you old night owl. Oh, no, Chris. I'm perfectly all right. I like to walk at night. Well... good night. Good night, penny. Hello. Oh, hello. You've been taking a walk, huh? Yes. It's so beautiful. Yes, it's one of the loveliest nights I've ever seen. The very loveliest. I, um-would you like to sit down and have a little chat? Oh, no, thanks, Brandy. I'd better go in. It's getting late. But, penny, there's something I've been wanting to ask you. I- I was wondering if you'd come down to the base sometime and play for the men. Oh, no. No, Brandy, i- I couldn't. But they love good music. Honest they do. And they're a very appreciative audience. Oh, you don't understand. I- I just couldn't, Brandy. I'm sorry. Good night. Is that you, penny? Yes. And me. I thought you'd gone to bed, Brandy. Well, I'm just going now, thanks. Good night. Good night. Sleep tight. Thanks. Night, penny. Good night, Brandy. I'm sorry, Lee. I guess I was pretty silly. I don't know what made me do such a thing. I- I guess- let's forget it. Ok. Where have you been? Oh, I went to banning's point. Banning's point? Uh-huh. I could see way down the coast to the lighthouse. And the dogwood along the road was-was so pure in the moonlight, i- I just ached all over. Lee, what's it like to be in love? Well, I-I suppose it's seeing the dogwood in the moonlight and aching all over. It does show, doesn't it? Huh? Love, I mean. He said it would. He said, there are 3 things you cannot hide: Love, smoke, and a man riding on a camel. Ha ha ha! Oh, Lee, he's so wonderful. I keep thinking about him all the time. I guess I knew that-that day in Providence. Oh, darling, how nice. And has he told you he likes you? No. Well, he told me. Oh, did he, Lee? He's always been so sweet about you. When we were painting together. Painting? The summerhouse this afternoon. Oh. Oh, I know he'll tell you himself soon. Remember, darling, Brandon's been through a war. He probably wants to be sure of his future before- but, Lee, it isn't- you know, all those boys have been through a lot. They don't talk about it, but it's there inside. They're not very sure of anything just now. Don't you worry, darling. Brandon's stationed at Newport. We'll have him out for lots of weekends. Lee, don't, please. Well, sure. I know it makes sense... But I don't want to be sensible. I want to get married now. So do I, darling. But how do you think Lee will feel? Lee? Look, Lee's never been on the wrong side of anything. She's certainly not going to start with you. Well, thanks, fella! Hey, Lee! Oh, gosh, I-I didn't know you were- eavesdropping?! Oh, I wouldn't have missed this for a million. Kay, darling, I'm so glad it's you. Oh, thanks, Lee. Bring your face over here. Mmmm! Will you be my bridesmaid, penny? Oh, of course. Oh, I don't think we've got any champagne. I never needed champagne less in all my life. Well, beautiful? What do you say? Oh, congratulations, chase, and all the happiness in the world. I'm-I'm terribly happy. Honestly, I am. There's a double reason for celebrating! I think there's an old bottle of flat ginger ale in the icebox. Come on. Lee, don't, please, I... Well, good night, everybody. Good morning! Hi, Lee. Where are you going? The city. Culligan? Culligan. Lee, I didn't know we were going in this morning. I'm not even dressed. You're fired... For stealing the boss' son. She's not sore at you. She's sore at me for stealing the boss' secretary. Oh, why don't you put some coffee in your sugar? Why don't you drink your own coffee? I had mine, early this morning. Hey, get the car. I have to catch the 8:42. I'll even drive you to the station. Good-bye. Mrs. Addams, I'll be gone when you get back, so I just wanted to say, thanks an awful lot. Oh, we loved having you, Brandon. Thanks. Come again next week, if you can, hmm? Thank you. Lee, I wanted to talk to you before you go. Why, sure. Well, not here. Darling, I'll be home on the 6:30. Could it keep until then? Yes, it can keep. Good-bye. Well. Me, I'm going to wash my hair. Me, I guess I'd better pack. I'm going to work in the garden. Hmm! What is it, an apron or a tool kit? You like it? It's pretty. Pretty, but if you fell overboard, you'd never come up. Ha ha ha! Well, I guess I better go pack. I- oh, do you have to go? Yeah, leave's up at noon. Oh, yeah. Uh-huh. Uh, you don't mind my coming back next weekend, do you? Oh, of course not. Uh, would you answer a letter if I wrote? Oh, of course I will. Yeah, that- that's swell. Well, I'll... Uh, I'll see you later. Yeah. Um, do you like it? Yeah... yeah. The war is over. Yeah. Hi there! Oh, hello, Chris! Oh, I, uh, I was just planting some asters. That's quite a number you're wearing there. Oh. I like it. It's practical and yet, I think it's feminine, too, don't you? Uh-huh. Oh, I look such a mess. I'm so dirty. Oh, but this garden dirt doesn't count. Oh, gardening is good for me. Huh? My psychiatrist said so. Well, he ought to know. Tell me, is Lee up yet? Oh. Lee went to New York. Already? Oh. I was going over to Providence myself, and I thought I might take her up the junction. Oh. Well, she'll be back on the 6:30. Chase is going to meet her. 6:30, huh? Tell chase not to bother. I'll pick her up myself. Well, I'm sure she wouldn't want you to trouble. No trouble at all. I'll be back from Providence about that time. Do you really have to leave? Yep. Got to see my baby. Your what? The Valerie ii. Oh, how is she? She floats, and before you know it, she'll be as good as new. Chris? Huh? I'll never forget last night. You were so nice. Oh, it wasn't difficult. You're pretty swell yourself. Bye, penny. Bye. May I help you, sir? Yes. Please. I - I'd like to get something for a lady. Yes. Did you have something special in mind? Yes, I saw it in the window, uh, uh... It was a-a... negligee, I think you call it. Oh. Could you describe it, sir? Well, yes, of course. It was on a dummy, and it looked like a-a... Well, it had, uh, it had sort of a fluffy stuff up around the neck, you know? And it came way down and out onto the floor, you know. And then, sort of like open grill work under the arms and here. Oh. Uh, did it have dolman sleeves? Dolman sleeves? Mm-hmm. Uh, well, that- that I-I wouldn't know. When did you see this in the window? About 10 years ago. Oh. Well, perhaps I can show you something similar. Thank you. About 14? Uh, dollars? No, size. Oh. I hadn't thought of the size. Uh, she'd be about your size. All right. I'll be back in a moment. Thank you. Is there something I could show you, sir? The young lady is taking care of me. Thank you. Say, that's kind of cute, isn't it? Mm-hmm. Is it gold? Yes. Would that be suitable for a junior miss? Yes, very. When you spin it, it spells "I love you." Well, what do you know? "I love you." That's cute, isn't it? You haven't got one of those that spells "I love your mother," have you? Ha ha ha! No! Watch your step, Mrs. Addams. Thank you, Joe. Red cap, lady? Why, Chris! Right this way. What are you doing here? Meeting you. Why? I'm kidnapping you for dinner. Oh, no. I can't. If you knew how much work I have to do, I've got to go home. I have to put in a call to New York. I have got the nicest telephone at my farm. At your-no, honestly, I can't. Do you want to walk? No. All right. Then, get in. But, Chris- stop arguing. In you go and sit down. A fella comes around, goes out of his way to pick you up and take you home... Well... You're just taking advantage of me because I'm tired. I am trying to love my neighbor. Is that wrong? How do you do, Mrs. Addams? How are you, William? Just fine, thank you. I'm glad to see you again. Thank you. I'm glad to see you. Good evening, William. Good evening, Mr. Matthews. Is the champagne on ice? Yes, sir. Fine. It's different! Huh? You've done something to it. Well, I've- oh, of course. You added a dining room. Like it? Mmm. Oh, William, I'll need this. Thank you. And the chintz is new. No, no. That's just been cleaned. That's all. Chris, it's lovely. I didn't get much good out of this place during the war. I didn't dare come down here. No telephone. No telephone? No, but there's one now, darling, right over there on the desk. Don't be alarmed. Oh, you! Now don't talk all night, what? I'm sorry I have to do this. Operator? Operator, I want New York. Rhinelander 6200. Yes, rhi- rhinelander 6200. I promised faithfully I'd do this as soon as I got here. Ok. Thank you. Hmm? Oh, the number. 28. Uxbridge 28. Uxbridge 28. Thank you, William. I'll take care of this. Yes, sir. Oh, William, did you get that little present over to miss penny? Yes, sir. I gave it to Mrs. Stover. Ah. Thank you very much. Hello? Hello. Is Mr. Culligan there? Mrs. Addams. I'll hold on. Mmm! Imported. Hello, Mr. Culligan? I worked out the details coming up on the train. You will have more than 16,000 square feet. Mm-hmm. But I've got it right here in front of me. That's right. Yes. Material shoots can be installed as per of the orig- don't talk with your mouth full. I said, material shoots will be installed as per the original plans. Yes. Oh, yes, I'll get you in by September. Of course. Caviar. Now, go away. This is important. More important than caviar? Can't imagine. Yes. Yes, that's right. 3 successive options and 5- year renewal. Mm- hmm. If I were making a deal with you, my pretty one, I wouldn't quibble over an option. I'm not marrying the man. I'm renting him a factory building. Just a minute. Is that your business face? I love it. Yes, Mr. Culligan. Yes, I'll draw up the papers right now. Thank you. Good-bye. Really. It's quite a business world you're working up for yourself, isn't it? No! Don't touch culligan. Is that culligan? That's culligan. May he rest in peace for 5 years with options. Uh, that's a cocktail. I have to call the house first. Very busy, aren't we? Uxbridge 14, please. I'll give you one minute. You know, you can be pretty obnoxious. At times. Hello? Kay? What's the matter with your voice? I'm being strangled to death, that's all. Ha ha ha! By your former secretary! Where? Where are you? Oh, swell. Yeah, sure. Yeah, I'll tell Mrs. Stover. See you later. Bye. Now, young lady, now, what? What is it with you? Ha ha ha! For heavens' sake! What goes on here? Oh, Mrs. Stover, Mrs. Addams just called. She said she wouldn't be home for dinner. Oh. Chase, as long as you're going upstairs to straighten up for dinner anyway, you might give this to penny. William brought it over. Yes, ma'am. See you later, Kay. All right. Penny! Yes? Package for you. Catch. Thank you. Chase! Yeah? Chase! Chase, look what Chris sent me. Say, that's pretty sharp. Well, it's beautiful. Come here. Hold it. Look. When you spin it, it says "I love you." What do you know? Oh, I think he's the most wonderful, dearest person in all the world. He's a guy, all right. Lee's having dinner with him. Isn't this adorable? What did you say? I said, Lee's having dinner with him over at his farm. But why? Well, I guess he must have asked her. Say, wouldn't it be a great idea? What? Lee and Chris. Mm-hmm. What's the matter? Lee and Chris... Oh, no. Why not? Say, I'll bet that's why he never got married. I'll bet he's been in love with her all these years. He's not in love with her. He couldn't be. Last night, the way she was dancing, making such a fool of herself... Are you crazy? You were the one that was out of line last night, and she didn't even get sore at you. I thought she was wonderful. Everything about Lee is wonderful. All you ever think about is Lee, Lee, Lee! Why shouldn't I? She spent her life thinking about me and you. And I've got to be grateful for it all the rest of my life, go down on my knees and- yes, and be glad to do it. Why? She's never been a mother like other girls have. She never came to school, to anything. All she's interested in is real estate. All she does is work! All she cares about is money! What does she do with it anyway? You really want to know? Yes! She pays our father's debts. What debts? Well, when dad died, there wasn't any money. No, penny. It wasn't a heart attack. What do you mean? He killed himself. He jumped from banning's point. I don't believe you. You think I'd make up a thing like that? I don't believe you. It-it could still have been his heart. He-he fell. It was an accident. It was no accident, penny. He left a note. You don't leave a note before an accident. That's why Lee took us away, to keep us out of all the scandal. That's why we've never come back. It's why she's worked so hard to clear everything up for us, so we could face people without feeling... Without feeling- well, just face people. Oh, I'm sorry, penny. But you were bound to hear this sometime, and it's better that you know it. Lee took us away to keep us out of the scandal. That was good of her, chase, wasn't it? You're darn right it was. Yes, it is better that I know about it, much better. Would you like- honestly, Chris, I couldn't eat another thing. I didn't say anything about food. All you women ever think of is food, food, food. Oh, ho ho ho! Mrs. Addams, I have performed a deed, a deed of consummate heroism. 10 years in the doing, I might add. Oh, no, be careful. Don't break it. Oh... Well, don't just sit there, aren't you going to open it? Of course, I might have gone to the malay peninsula and brought you back a bengal tiger, but believe me, this took far more courage. Oh, Chris! It's just beautiful. Do you like it? Oh, I love it! You're not going to put it on over that, are you? I certainly am. Oh, I see. There's a mirror over there if you want it. Oh, no. That's one thing about a negligee, you can't put it on wrong. I better help you if you want to tie this all up. Hold your chin up out of the way. How did you know my size? Well, I'll tell you- oh, I know. I know. Yes, I remember. I look like the dummy. Nah, that was 10 years ago that you looked like the dummy. There you are. Yeah. Yes, I have got good taste, and... I don't mean the negligee. Lee, I'm not going to pretend that I've carried a torch for 10 years. It was tough going at first, but... I managed to forget you for long months on end. And then i-well, I thought I'd learned to live without you. But I knew yesterday when I dropped in at the farm and saw you standing there all covered with paint, that I was right back where I started. Oh, Chris. Lee, last night you said you had a job to do. All of a sudden, that job is finished. I'm asking you to take on another one. It's not as simple as all that. You can't launch a couple of kids as you would a boat. Penny's still a child. Brandon is still in the Navy. I- I've got to make sure. Darling, exactly what do you think you can do alone for penny that we can't do better together? I don't know. Oh, darling, darling, darling. And only yesterday, I said you couldn't span 10 years in 2 short hours. And only yesterday, I knew you were wrong. How did you know? There are 3 things you cannot hide: Love, smoke, and- a man riding on a camel! Oh, Lee! Chris! What's the matter? You said that to penny. Why, yes, as a matter of fact, I believe I did. Oh! Chris! It's not Brandon at all! It's you. She's in love with you. Penny?! What are you talking about? Oh, Chris! What on earth- come in, chase. I'm sorry to bust in on you like this, Chris, but have you seen penny? No, why? Well, she didn't show up for dinner. I've been out looking for her for over an hour. What happened? Well, we-we had a little row, and I said some things. I had to, Lee. I told her about dad. What did you tell her? I told her about banning's point. Oh, no, chase! You didn't. Well, she seemed to take it fine, so I went on down and started to have dinner with Kay. When she didn't come down, I went back up, and she was gone. I thought she might have- penny! Penny! Penny! Look! This is penny's. I gave it to her. Then she has been here! Yeah. Let's look around back, chase. Penny! Banning's point. Penny! Penny! No. Don't you come any closer. It's too late. It's too late to do anything now. You killed my father. You don't know what you're saying. How could he go on living when he knew about you and Chris? Penny! You took us away from the scandal, but you had to come back, didn't you, Lee? Back to the scandal, back to Chris. That's not true! No! No, don't be frightened, Lee. Everything's all right. You can have Chris, but you'll never be happy. He'll hate you as I do. 'Cause I'm going to do what my father did. Oh, penny, listen to me! Your father didn't kill himself because of Chris and me! He killed himself because he was a thief! He-he stole the bank's money. He was faced with disgrace and jail! Do you hear me? Penny, do you hear me? Penny! Oh, penny. Oh, penny. If she'd only say something. It's like- it's like shock. Yeah. Did you get Dr. Rossiger? Still no answer. If she'd only say something. If she'd only cry. It's almost 2:00. I thought maybe a little coffee might keep you going. Oh, that's very nice, Mrs. Stover. She ain't spoke? Poor soul. Does Lee take it black? Yes. I'm going to take this in to her. Lee. Perhaps, if you tried to sleep, darling... Perhaps, in the morning, we could... I can understand your not wanting to talk, penny, but if only I knew that you could hear me. Don't you see that I had to say what I said up there on the point tonight. I know it was cruel. It was brutal, but you were so close-so clo- The facts were brutal, penny. But sometimes, the reasons people do things are much more important than the very things they do. Your father wasn't a thief. He was a man who only wanted music, and they wouldn't let him have it. They broke his heart, darling. And one day, he-he made a mistake. Then he got frightened, frightened of what it would do to you and to chase and to me. He loved you more than anything in this world, penny. He wanted to make it possible for you to go on and be a great musician. You will be a great musician, my darling, when you've learned to play for everybody. I want you to play for me and chase and Chris. I want you to play for Brandon and the boys. And then, I want you to go back to school next fall and graduate with your class and go to dances and- and when I come to visit you, will you take that walk with me, the one that girls take with their fathers? Oh, Lee! Oh, I'm so ashamed! Penny! Penny!
