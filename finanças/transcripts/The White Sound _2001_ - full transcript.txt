Our religion teacher used to say: "the clouds are the visible part of the sky" For us, the sky was our soul, and the clouds were our visions. THE WHITE SOUND But if too many clouds come up, you don't see the sky anymore. It's me. I'm real! I'm for real! Man! Man! Eh! Are we there? - Yes. Shit! I have to pick up my brother. Damn!

No, I'd like two tickets for "Taxi Driver", 8.15pm here. I've already told you you're wrong. "Taxi Driver" only starts Monday. - No, it's you who's wrong!

No way! Are you sure you can drive? - Sure! Really? Oh, the exhaust's fallen off. Hey Jochen, stop, man! - That was the exhaust! That's the exhaust! Shit! - Then shouldn't we stop? Shit! - You can't drive anymore. What's with the exhaust? - He can't drive anymore. Kati, tell him... What? What? - Tell him... Almost ready to go! Couldn't you drive instead? - Okay, if you like. I'm driving. - No. - I'm driving! Hey, I... - Get out! Is it my car or yours? Piss off! Hey guys, you hear that? Where are we going? What're you doing? - Shortcut! What're you doing? - We're flying!

It was real heavy! It started all of a sudden. I was sitting here looking out, and then you started. You really got at me! You said I was the village idiot. It was totally weird! - A mushroom high. Sometimes mushrooms are a bad trip. - Really? You should've said that before. - It's a real fine line. It'll go away again. I tried talking with you, but I couldn't get through to you! It felt like I was somehow outside of myself, totally... Perhaps I took too much, I dunno. Does it last long? - Isn't it over? Will it come again? HEY KATl, WHAT'S UP WITH YOUR BROTHER? - HE'S FUCKED IN THE HEAD. YEAH, HE'S ALWAYS HAD A SCREW LOOSE. - NO WONDER HE PISSES YOU OFF. WHAT IF WE PRETEND EVERYTHING'S ALRIGHT?

THE SOUNO OF WATER... ...COVERS ALL FREQUENCIES. Hey! Who's in the shower? Forget it. He's been in the shower all day. Lukas, is that you? LOOK FOR THE WHITE SOUND. YOU'LL ONLY FIND PEACE IN THE WHITE SOUND. Lukas? Lukas! That's enough now! LOOK FOR THE WHITE SOUND. Come on. He'll come out when he's hungry. Have you eaten? - No. I'll make something. - Cool. SHOOT YOURSELF IN THE HEAD! - PLEASE, LUKAS! HE'S MAKING A TRANSCRIPT. VOICE 1: KATI: KILL YOURSELF! VOICE 2: EVIL MAN: DIE! FUCK YOU! THOU SHALT NOT STEAL, THOU SHALT NOT LIE, THOU SHALT NOT KILL. HE'S LISTENING AT THE HEATER. HA, YOU CAN'T RECORD US! RECORDING FAILED PROJECT 1. VOICE ANALYSIS LOOK AT HIS HANDS! Look at his hands. They're sticky from jerking off. Nutcase! Chop off your ugly cock! Or be a man and come and fuck me! WHAT ARE YOU MEASURING? NOISE? YOU REALLY ARE MAD. YOU DON'T BELONG HERE. YOU'RE REALLY MAD. PISS OFF, ASSHOLE! YOU RIDICULOUS FREAK! 2. DEFENSE MEASURES YOU'RE SUCH A LOSER. - ASSHOLE. Hey, Luka! Just in time to dry up. Lukas? Lukas! Jochen? You wanna mess with me? Hey, what's going on? Have you been talking about me? You think I'm not there? I'm here. Okay! Hey, stay cool, man. Stop talking crap! Zap! All innocent, aren't you? Hey, what...! - Shut the fuck up! Shut your hole. Shut your stupid hole. Stop talking shit! Are you cleaning up? Stop talking about me. Just stop it. What's going on? What's up? No idea. What's up? Watch your step. - Shut your mouth, you slut. - Shut your own, asshole. Take a look at yourself. - So? It's none of my business, but you need a wash. Hands off! - Come on. Hey, that's enough, OK? Luka! Fuck off! Fuck off! Hey, what's wrong? Just stop it! - You stop it! Stop it! - You're acting crazy. - Kati, stop it! Stop what? But we had an agreement! We shop and pay the rent together... - Stop the crap. What crap? You know exactly what I mean. - No, I don't. I can't read minds. Want to get HIGH again? What is it? Nice, isn't it? - Look at his room! - My brother's really creative. Not HIGH enough, eh? - Get out. Jochen, get out. - Jochen, come on out. Luka, please! Sure we've talked about you! You talk about me, too! What? What've we done? What? Stop it, man! Get out! Get out! Piss off! Piss off! Come on, let him work it off. - No, no, no! Let me go. Give him 5 minutes, then we'll go in. - OK, I'll give him 5 minutes. OK, OK! I'll give you 5 minutes. I'm waiting! Hey, come on... - It can't go on like this, OK? Comes crying to me: "I want to get out of Rarbach, help me!" Then there's a room free, everything's easy, and he goes crazy! Let me go! - Come with me. TODAY WE'LL KILL YOU, MAN! YEAH, MAN, FOR SURE, MAN! WHAT? YOU'RE A LOSER! Right on, right on! Mental or what? WHY ARE YOU STILL ALIVE? - Because I'm here! Lie on the grass in a green field! Shut the fuck up, you asshole! KILL YOURSELF! JUST DO IT! Why? 'CAUSE YOU'RE USELESS. KILL YOURSELF! DO IT! NO ONE WILL MISS YOU. Hey, Kati! It'll be alright. - I imagined it all differently. I'm sorry. Ute's complained too. He freaks out, tears up the place, almost bashes the door in! But he wanted to do it up, man! Yeah, it looks great with all the junk in it. What is it? Yes? Luke, you OK? Luke? Luka? Luka! Luka! Lukas? Open the door! Open the door! - Luka! Lukas! Luka! JUMP! Schizophrenia is very frequent, about as frequent as diabetes. Around 1 in 100 people suffers from it, in every culture. A recovery is absolutely possible, although not in every case. But you don't know what happened! We... We took... sorry... We took a few drugs, and since then... ...he hasn't been so well. Yes, hallucinogens like psilocybin mushrooms can trigger a psychosis, it's true, but... it's not the cause. He's no psycho, he's a nice, normal guy! He just had some bad luck with a girl, and... ...and moving to the city was too much for him. He's just really sensitive! Other symptoms are delusions like paranoia, or persecution mania. Or hallucinations. The patient hears voices. Then there are thought disturbances... I have thought disturbances too, but I don't need fuckin' Haldol! He can't move, and he doesn't recognize me anymore! Please believe me! I can look after him! He can stay in my room while we clean up his, and I'll keep an eye on him until he's better. I'll send him to therapy, too. But I don't want him here on hard drugs! Miss Delius, I'll be clear. Your brother gave his written consent, and he'll be here the next 6 weeks. I'm sorry. Your brother is a danger to himself... - Then I'll stay too! Admit me as well! One more question: Have there been cases of mental illness in your family? How... ...did Mom die? Your mother killed herself. And how? My God, why do you want to know that? She hanged herself. Here? At our house? I was four. I would have... ...known about it. - No. In Marsberg. Whenever Luka and I thought... ...Mom was... ...having treatment for her back, she was in the psychiatric clinic. Why didn't you tell us? This is a shit job. Didn't I say we should get bigger rollers? - Sure... ...at 25 marks for one roller. Pretty high up! I guess I'll crash. If you need anything, "we're at your service!" Ciao. A present from Jochen! I've brought you something. There are jobs in it and stuff. You can look for a job. Oh. Hello, I'm calling about the forklift driving course. - Yes. When is it exactly? Mondays and Wednesdays. Have you any experience driving forklifts? No. - None. Moch Mannequins. Hello. My name's Lukas Delius. I'd like to apply for a job in your firm. We actually need someone at present... - Yes. ...so it might be good if you came for an interview. - Yes? What do you have to do? - What sort of wage do you have in mind? Or isn't it so important? No. It says minimum wage here, right? Yeah, that'd be good. Shall we say 4 p.m.? - Fine! The name's Delius, right? - Yes, Delius. - Fine. You know where we are? - Ah, yes. - OK. OK, thanks! - Goodbye. - Bye! You didn't even ask what you have to do! Yeah, cool! Coming? - Yeah. Wanna keep it on? - Yep. Well? Oh, shit! It's 3 o'clock. I've gotta go! O'you know where it is? - Yeah, sure. The tag! Good luck! - See you tonight. I'll cross my fingers! - Yeah! Run! clicking, cracking ... white noise -but when it's still? (mumbling) It's not that I... ...that I just hear voices. I really feel someone's there. You can't... ...you can't explain it logically. I don't know how to explain it. They adapt to the acoustics of the room. You know? Ah! So when you're outside, you hear them outside, and inside you hear them in the room. It can't be me doing it. Yeah, sure. That's why. But that was before the loony bin. It was pretty tough. That's why I take the pills. The voices are quieter now, sort of in the background. They're not so clear anymore. Are you crazy? Prevention! - You can't just take them like that! It's not aspirin! Plus I need them! What d'they do? They make the voices quieter. Problem is... ...they knock you out. I feel pretty tired all day. Then stop taking the shit. No! No way! They make it better. Lukas, could you cut off its head? Cut off its head? With the saw, here. Oh, haven't you done it before? - No. You turn it on here, raise this... There you go. I can't do it. OK, I'll show you, it's not hard. You put it on here... ...start here... Here you go. IT CAN'T ALL BE A COINCIDENCE. ROBOTS! THEY'RE NOT ALIVE. THEY'RE DEAD, MAN! WHERE ARE THE TRANSMITTERS? Come with me! Just a sec. Come here. Do you see up there? Yeah. Satellite dishes. Aha. Satellite dishes. Come with me. It's top secret! When you're in the street, people come towards you, and you think it's all normal. But you have to look them in the eye, d'you see? And then you see they're watching you. Like that woman at the kiosk. Whenever I'm here she's standing there, all innocent! She just likes being there! - No, no, no. There are people who just like looking. It's not a plan, Luka! That car there... ...d'you see? The silver one. That's the car usually driven by the secret service. - Luka! You don't understand me. Almost no one understands. So. What's this? What's what? Since when have you had books on robots? LOOK FOR THE WHITE SOUND! IT CAN'T ALL BE A COINCIDENCE. YOU HAVE TO FIND OUT WHAT'S BEHIND IT. THE MACHINE, MAN. WE'RE PART OF IT. You haven't taken your pills for 3 days. - Me? I don't take my pills anymore. I, Lukas, don't take my pills anymore. - Or have you bought new ones? No, I don't take my pills anymore. Kati, do you take your pills? Or Jochen? Think for a sec. That's a load of shit. Listen to me! C'mon, please take one. OK? You want my brain softened up? You want my brain to be softened up the whole time? Enough of this crap, Lukas. D'you think you're the only person in the world? Look at me! Do you think of me, or Jochen, or anyone but yourself? Okay, don't take your pills! Go back to the hospital, but I won't visit you this time! I only want... - Shut your mouth, you bitch! So my brain stays nice and soft? - Hey, are you nuts? Stupid asshole! There are other people besides you! - What? Why should I take my tablets, huh? So you feel better! - So I feel better! So my brain's soft! What about brainwashing, huh? Want some? You piece of shit! Are you for real? Are you for real, Kati? And you? Are you for real? Are you still my brother? WATCH OUT. OH, HE'S OPEN AGAIN! HE CAN HEAR US! I CAN'T STAND HIM! HE'S ALL THUMBS! WHY IS HE ALWAYS STARING AT US LIKE THAT? YOU BELONG IN THE ASYLUM, YOU'RE PSYCHO! YES, YOU! I HOPE THEY FIRE HIM SOON! WE'LL CUT YOUR HEAD OFF! THEY'RE WATCHING! HE'S LISTENING AGAIN! IT'LL BE PAINFUL. IT'LL BE REALLY PAINFUL! GO GET HIM! WE'LL GET YOU! YOU'RE AS GOOD AS DEAD! NO NEED TO RUN, WE'LL GET YOU ANYWAY! WE'LL ALWAYS GET YOU! WE'VE GOT HIM TRAPPED. THEY'VE CHANGED THE LOCK! THEY DON'T WANT YOU ANYMORE. THEY'VE MOVED OUT! GO INTO YOUR ROOM! SOMEONE ELSE IS LIVING HERE NOW. Hey, idiot! - We want to come in too! Piss off! - What're you doing here anyway? What're you doing here? - Let me try. You wanna shower too? - D'you know him? Lukas, is that you? - Piss off! You've got the wrong flat! What's wrong with you? What's wrong with you? - What's wrong with YOU, dammit? Talk to us! What is it? What is it? They should leave me alone! Sit down. - Let me go! Let me go! No one's going to hurt you. OK? No one! Least of all me. They should leave me alone. Tell them they should back off. OK? - OK. I promise. I'll tell them. I'll tell them. - That idiot. I saw how he looked at me. - He wasn't after you. That fucking idiot, I'll kill him. - He wasn't after you, Lukas. Come on, come on. I... ...I only want... ...to help you. But you can't help us. And I can't help you. I'm supposed to go back to the clinic tomorrow. I have to prevent that in every way I can. I won't survive that a second time. I've got to give a sign. Hey, Toby, there's someone in the water! He's drowning! Come here! We'll take him with us for now. Get him into the bus. We have to take off his wet clothes. And how did you get into the river, if I may ask? Oh well, you don't have to tell me. There aren't so many ways to get into a river like that. Look, we're almost in Spain. Where are we going? I'd say we'll drive to San Sebastian, then down the coast from there. Hasta luego, senorita! Great! The first Spanish woman. Do we stop here? I've got to... Like the Pope! Great beach! - Nice waves here, wow! Put something on, Lukas, you're really ill. And take off your wet things. Come back up with me. Your breakfast's on the table. Come on. - He doesn't want to. He wants to stay with me. But his nose is running like mad. - It's not a problem. Is it a problem that he's with me or what? He just doesn't want to go with you. Shit hippy crap. Fucking hippies! I've had it. Fucking hippy burn-outs. Hippy freaks. Long-haired little bitches. One big family, one big family. Buses. Driving in buses. Bus! Cool bus. Bloody dirtbags. Change the world! Ethno-assholes. Gotta teach those smelly hippies some style. Dietmar! Can you put on some real music? Instead of this folk crap? Not that. We barely use it. Not that either. Groove! I get sentimental when I see these. That's from the Sitex company. They used it to board up the windows of the house we squatted in. That's the company that seals off cleared squats. Hey, Eno, get your little doggy away from here. I don't know what he's about. Hanging around, scrounging off people. I'm getting pissed off. Drinks my beer, plays Mr. Cool. What's the point? Let's get rid of this bum. - Hippy, hippy, happy hippy. Are you alright? Go do the dishes, then we can eat shortly after. just back there at the tap. It's not that dirty, but full of sand. -why me? I thought everyone does a little. We're all driving together. Jeah, later. Shrimps! THEY'LL LAUGH ABOUT YOU. YOU JUST DON'T BELONG HERE. NO ONE WANTS YOU. It's pretty complicated because of the 3 different currencies. And now I've got some Belgian cash back... Some of it's missing. more or less. I don't really know... I've no idea where they could be. Have you seen them perhaps? Maybe in the pants I lent you? - What? Maybe in the pants I lent you? YOU'VE ROBBED US, YOU THIEF! Why are you looking at me? No reason. It's just strange. FILTHY PUNK! You don't have to look away! You can look at me! - Yeah, I can look at you. I know what you think. - No, you don't. - Of course I do! All I'm thinking is you'd better cool it. Assholes! Relax, man. Hey, Lukas. That is definitly nothing for you. -Why? That's not a nice story. that's totally crazy what he spoke onto the tape. Ok, I'll go and get the "little ice bear". -it's better if you listen to something different. ...then the band stopped playing, a a fireman went to the microphone and said: "Now for our raffle..." What's wrong? You wanna go for a walk? What's the matter with you? Aren't we having a great time? Why are you so fucked up? I'm just trying to talk to you, man. Have I hurt you in any way? You're looking at me as if I was an evil criminal! Now he's laughing again. I've written something in the sand. Wanna read it? Sure. - Over there! - Won't you tell me? No, it's a surprise. - You coming? - No, I'll stay here! holla lukas (hello lukas) bonas notche (good night) handover the money what are you doing here? can't be. Do you belong to us? what do you want from me? get lost! What is it? Can we go, Eno? - Are you all ready? Lukas's driving with Eno, I think. Eno, is Lukas going with you? OK. Lukas? We're leaving. Are you coming? I'll stay here. OK. Take care. We'll leave you a tent and some food. The doctors called me schizophrenic, most other people just said I was mad. I didn't care what people called me. What I was looking for was a life I could lead. The white sound is all the visions of all people of all times, Eno had explained to me. Something like God or the universe as a whole. Whoever sees the white sound has reached the highest state of enlightenment. And do you know what else he said? The white sound is the ultimate trip. Whoever sees it goes insane. Unless he's insane already. Then he turns sane. The trick is to go backwards along the path of enlightenment. At the start of the path, the chaos in your head will stop, and normal life will begin. That's for sure.
