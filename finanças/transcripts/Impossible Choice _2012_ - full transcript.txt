(jazzy music) Mark: Yes, I'm Professor Mahler. I'm here to tell you that theater is life! Logan: I could have been a famous actor, writer, producer, singer, impresario, and dancer, and won the Nobel Prize. Mark: Ah, but I chose to teach dumb-ass college kids instead. &quot;To be, or not to be. That is the question.&quot; Logan: Class, what did my friend Willie the Bard try to say here? Brandon: Hey, what's up? Mark: Headed to Drama 201. Logan: AKA &quot;The Theater Wants You&quot;. Where are you headed? Brandon: Music 220, AKA &quot;The Piano Wants Me&quot;. Logan: I doubt it. Mark: The piano wants a babe, like Lorri. Brandon: Ah, yes, the woman of mystery. Mark: Ah, yes. Logan: GFs aside, do you want to do the band thing or the lake this weekend? Mark: Let me see, we can write inane songs and argue about the arrangements or get drunk and camp out on the beach. Did I mention get drunk? (laughs) Hello. Professor: Now, repeat after me. Theater is life. Class: Theater is life. Professor: Film is art. Class: Film is art. Professor: Television is furniture. Class: Television is furniture. Professor: Now you may applaud. (applause) Professor: Thank you very much. It's assignment time. This single project will account for 50% of your total grade, so I refer to it as the big one. The envelopes, please. Now, pay attention. On the outside of these are two of your names. You're going to be working in pairs. Theater is always a cooperative endeavor. Now, as a team, you're going to research, write, produce, and perform right here, a 10-minute scene. Each of the envelopes contain the names of two real people. They're of the subjects of your drama. Now, the first pair will perform 6 weeks from today, and because the show must go on, you must present on the date assigned. No whining, no extensions, no excuses. Are there any questions? Yes. Student: Can we trade envelopes if we don't like the subjects we're assigned? Professor: No. Yes. Mark: Is it okay if it's a little longer or shorter than 10 minutes? Professor: Yes, mm-hmm. Student: I don't know exactly how to say this, but what if we don't want to work with our assigned partner? Professor: Then you will learn something about life. Are there any other questions? Logan: Yes! Sarah: Good morning. Joining us today is Scott Deming, President of Deming and Deming International. As you know, about 6 months ago, we hired them, and Scott is here today with his recommendations. Scott. Scott: Thank you. Morning! All: Morning. Scott: All right. Let's talk about making some money. All right. Our key concept here is that we're developing a desirable package vacation experience, not just a cruise. Let's take a quick look at our financial projections. Our projections are based on 55 passengers. The length of the package is 4 days, so on the other 3 days, you can operate as you normally would. The fare is $800, and that is inclusive. Now, if we back out the operating costs, we have a net seasonal profit of $375,000 Now, I will pass out detailed financial reports later, but that is profit. Dan: Scott, my father always said that if something sounds too good to be true, well, then, it probably is, so what's going on here? Scott: All right, Dan, the plan is to tailor a targeted cruise &quot;package&quot; and then market the hell out of it. Dan: And that target is ... ? Scott: Sounds like the Academy Awards. And the target is ... The target is gay tourists. Now, they have the money, they have- Dan: Gay? We can't do that! Scott: Dan, the major cruise lines have been offering gay cruises since the beginning of- Dan: We're not a major cruise line. We're small. We run in small towns. People know and trust us. We're part of their community. We're Americana, canal history, Scott. This is a no go idea. Sarah: Dannie, let's just hear him out. This is a revenue issue. It's not a gay rights issue. Dan: This is insanity. Can we offer a Black cruise? I don't think so. Scott: No, no. We could not offer a Black cruise. Dan: Well, hell no! Scott: But we could offer a Black Heritage cruise. Have them play jazz, serve soul food, make stops at historic Black sites, like the Underground Railroad or the Jerry Rescue. Dan: Then whey don't we do that then? Scott: Okay, so Black are okay, but gays are not? Sarah: Guys, we seem to have lost our focus here. Dan: I don't think that we can float into one of these small towns with a bunch of fags on board. Peter: Let's just hear Scott out. That's what we're paying him for. Dan: (sighs) So, then what do we do with our &quot;straight&quot; customers? It's a slippery fucking slope, if you ask me. Sarah: We didn't. Scott: All are welcome. There is no war between gay people and straight people, Dan. Dan: Okay, that's what we like to think. Just like there's no racial bias in America since Lincoln freed the slaves. Sarah: Think bottom line. Dan: Think destroying this company. Scott, are you gay? Scott: Are you? Dan: I have a wife and two kids. Scott: That doesn't answer my question. (shower running) (Mark singing) (Music: Let it Roll) Mark: Ohh, baby, big load. Did I ever tell you that I love you? Lorri: No. Mark: Lying bitch! That's it, I'm pulling over. You're getting out. Lorri: Good. Then you can give that ring you gave me back to the Cracker Jack company. Mark: So, how's the warrior brother doing? Lorri: Better than I am. Mark: You worried? Lorri: Worried, angry. He should be off at college, not fighting for Corporate America or lying politicians. Mark: Well, I think it's time we put our minds to the beach. Lorri: Superficial musician. Mark: Calling me superficial? Lorri: No, calling you a musician, lowest of low. Mark: Kiss me. Lorri: No. Mark: Touch it. Lorri: Not now. Mark: (sighs) Later? Lorri: (laughs) That all depends. Mark: If you tag me, I'll do anything you want tonight. Lorri: Does that mean I get to sleep by myself? Mark: Aww, that's a nasty thought. (splash) Logan: When you kids are through screwing around, we can get under way. Mark: It's her fault! (boat motor) Need some help? Brandon: So how far is it to Oneida Shores? Logan: About 25 miles, but we have to go through a lock, and that's going to slow things down a bit. Brandon: So, how long? Logan: About an hour and a half, two hours. Brandon: It's beautiful out here. A little noisy, but beautiful. Too bad Ken was busy. Logan: As usual. Brandon: Want a root beer? Logan: Root beer? Real men drink beer beer. Brandon: Real captains drink no bear. Logan: Thanks, Mom. Lorri: Hey, guys, listen up. there's an interesting article in the Times. Brandon: Women read, men jerk off. Logan: I'm telling your dad. Lorri: Research at Syracuse University in Upstate New York suggests that men who purchase how-powered sports cars and speed boats may be compensating for self-perceived sexual inadequacy. Mark: Where the fuck did this come from? Lorri: Idiots. I'm on a boat with idiots. Sarah: And, we've got a lot to do to make this happen, so I'm going to divide up the workload. Captain Dan, I want you to get all the permissions and permits that we might need to any of the villages where we dock. Oh, and as a heads up, when you hire a crew, they better be cute and liberal. Dan: Oh, Sarah, I don't think that we can ask, &quot;Do you like fags?&quot; on an employment application. Libby: Is this a violation of &quot;don't ask, don't tell&quot;? Sarah: Not any more. My brave and brilliant captain, I'm sure you'll find a way to handle this. Okay, Libby, you're going to handle the marketing, so we're going to need to update the web site and create a new brochure for this special package. Peter, I want you to handle the food and entertainment. Peter: Why me? Sarah: Because you have ... Peter: I'm just kidding. I love food and entertainment, especially gay food and entertainment. Logan: I just want you to know, I don't need any help! Brandon: Smile, 3, 2, 1. Lorri: Okay. Brandon, give me the camera. I'm going to take one of you and Logan. So get together, closer. Okay, right here. Lorri: Okay, another one, happy. Brandon: How'd it turn out? Lorri: Like a pair of monkeys. (laughs) Mark: I think the women folk should go get some food together while us men build houses. Brandon: I'll stay with Lorri. You two bucks have fun pitching the tents. Mark: Keep your hands on the food, not Lorri. Brandon: I think he likes you. Lorri: You think? (guitar music) Mark: This is too close. Logan: Here? Mark: Here. Logan: Oh, the man wants his privacy so nobody hears the woman scream. Mark: No, it's the view. Is there a bathroom around here? Logan: Not unless you brought one. There is one about a mile down the trail, and good luck with the snakes. Mark: Piss on that. Get it? I'll be back in a minute. Logan: So, what are you gals fixing? Oh, sorry Brandon. Lorri: You've been hanging out too much with Markie. Where is my man-like friend? Logan: Peeing. Lorri: That sounds about right. Lunch is almost ready. Mark: Yeah, baby. Mm. Ouch. (laughs) (Mark making slurping noises) Oh yeah, give it to him. Ah! Circumsized. (laughs) Lorri: You're slow, you're slow. Logan: Oh, come on, Pansy! Eat it! Lorri: Hey, you. We're going for a walk. Logan: Watch out for poison ivy. Lorri: Right? Brandon: Watch out for Mark. Lorri: We'll be back in an hour or so. I'm hoping the baby will get tired. Logan: Have fun. Brandon: We could practice. Logan: We could get some sun. Brandon: You win. (Music: Take Me Home Tonight) (dog panting) Logan: Where did you come from? Brandon: It's so cute. I guess it's time we get back to camp. Logan: Or we could just stay out here. Brandon: This place is beautiful. Logan: You're not so bad yourself, if you weren't such a bad ass. (upbeat music) Driver: Sir, you want me to wait, right? Bill: Yes. Driver: That's gonna cost, wait time. Bill: No problem. Driver: Is there anything else, sir? Bill: No, Dad. We should be wrapped in about half an hour. Driver: Okay, boys. Be safe. Bill: Keep the change. (Music: Lose Control) Peter: (claps) That was outstanding! Exactly what we're looking for. Bill and Martin: We are the best. Peter: No doubt. Bill: You want us? Peter: It's a deal. Driver: I watched your show. Bill: And? Driver: It was okay, but I think you can make more money selling drugs. Martin: Or drive a limo! (laughter) Brandon: Are you sure you saw them? Mark: Yeah, yeah, yeah. He checked them just before we left, but I don't remember where he put 'em. Brandon: I think that this is illegal. Mark: It's not like this is a robbery or something. Brandon: No, but he did say that they're required by the Coast Guard. Mark: Oh, yeah. They're probably out looking for us right now. &quot;Admiral, there are not enough flares on Logan's boat. &quot;Dispatch the Navy.&quot; Mark: Yes, here they are! Brandon: Logan's going to be pissed. Mark: How's that different from usual? Brandon: Let's get out of here. Mark: Hey, look at it this way, it's all in the name of romance. Brandon: Just like rape. Mark: You are a sick puppy! Hey, if we really want to get Logan, we could untie the boat. Brandon. Great idea. Mark: I hope you're not being sarcastic, otherwise I'll have to cut your nuts off, if I could find them. Brandon: Fag. Mark: Is it that obvious? Brandon: I know what you could do with one of those flares. (water splashing) (guitar music) Mark: Most of you may know me as an amazing drummer and vocalist, but you may not know that I'm also a master of guitar. Logan: Right, you tell 'em. (laughs) Mark: I'm dedicating this song to the most beautiful and brilliant woman in the entire world. Logan: Your mother. (laughs) Mark: Lorri, who lights up my life with every breath every time I see her. Logan: Or touch her. Lorri: Logan, you're feeling sentimental. Why don't you do a dedication. Mark: It's all right. Lorri: Logan? Logan: I dedicate this, uh, Mark's song, to anyone who can't see the love that's right in front of them. Lorri: That's nice. Brandon? Brandon: I ... Logan: Thanks. Brandon: dedicate this song to those who are afraid. Lorri: Afraid? Of what? Brandon: I don't know. Themselves, i guess. (music playing) Libby: Good afternoon, and thanks for coming. I'm here to select models for a brochure and a short video for the web. we are introducing a gay cruise. Model 1: Hey, do you think we look gay? Model 2: This is a fucking outrage! Model 3: Would you like your friends to see you as gay? Maybe you are. Model 4: I'm not doing something with another guy! Model 5: Typecast! The guys that look too good are always gay! Model 1: Such bullshit! Model 3: Come on, guys, get her! Libby: And I wanted you to know this in case it's an issue for you. Okay, moving right along. the headshot is for my sister. Just kidding. This is the part I've been waiting for. Would you please remove your clothes? Your shirts, that is. Man: Freudian slip? Libby: Wishful thinking. Decisions, decisions. Oh, screw it! You're all hired. Dad was right, I am easy. Mark: Kerosene. Is this cool or what? They used to use this on the railroad before there was batteries, and on farms, back before there was rural electric. Lorri: Yeah, and Mrs. O'Leary's cow knocked one over and almost took out half of Chicago. Mark: I thought you'd like it. Lorri: I do, it's beautiful. Mark: You're beautiful. Lorri: I know. Mark: No, I mean like the most beautiful. As beautiful as the stars. Lorri: Mm, and I was hoping for the moon, my sensitive poetic man. (laughs) Wait, other side. Shadows. Mark: Ahh, yeah. I'm attracted to smart women, and the moon. Lorri: Ahh, then you've come to the right place. (laughing) (soft music) Brandon: Mark gave it to me. Logan: What? Brandon: The lantern. Logan: Oh. Brandon: I never knew it could be so quiet. Logan: Quiet lets you think. Brandon: About what? Logan: Life and other shit, like the band's success. We have a better chance of getting eaten by wolves tonight. Brandon: Man, it's hot in here. Logan: Maybe the lantern. Brandon: Maybe it's global warming. That's better. Could it be the alcohol? Logan: No way, alcohol makes you cool. So, what are you gonna be when you grow up? Brandon: I've always been what my parents wanted me to be. Logan: Parents just want clones to take over the family business. Brandon: I've always had to be perfect. Dad wouldn't approve of my behind here right now. Logan: How's that? Brandon: There's alcohol, for one thing, not that he doesn't drink. And Mark and Lorri are sexual sinners who might corrupt my purity. (laughs) Do you believe in God? Logan: God, the invention of man. Strike me down. Brandon: Yeah, that one. Logan: I don't think we know much about our existence in the rest of the universe. There's no big guy up in the sky that knows and controls everything. Or he's really bad at his job. Brandon: Blasphemy! Logan: A bunch of guys got together, certainly no women, and wrote a novel titled, &quot;The Holy Bible&quot; and used the rambling bore to their advantage as the &quot;Word of God&quot;, and so we got things like the Dark Ages, the Salem Witch Trials, the Spanish Inquisition, the Crusades. Brandon: Maybe I shouldn't have asked. The Church does good things. Logan: Right. Like wars make jobs for the unemployed. Brandon: So, what do you think about the Beatles? Logan: You already know. Why don't you ask me about love or sex or condom use? Something appropriate for tent talk? Don't you wonder why I don't have a Lorri in tow? Brandon: No. I mean, it's not my business. I didn't bring anyone either. Logan: I noticed. So are you afraid to ask? Brandon: What's that supposed to mean? Logan: You tell me. Brandon: I think it's time to get some sleep. Logan: Are you afraid? Brandon: Yeah. (music playing) (students talking) Professor: Good afternoon. Hello. Ah, how nice. First, a reminder. For those of you who have not yet seen the Syracuse stage production of Death of a Salesman, you must do so by Wednesday, and no, it is not my autobiography. Now, are there any questions? Good. Today's exercise is being presented by Mark and Logan. They have asked me to set the scene. This place is neither heaven nor hell, just a way-point in the afterlife where two men meet as they head further into the unknown. (drum beats) Logan: Hi. Mark: Hi. I'm Matt. Logan: Nice to meet you. Nice to meet anyone. Do you know where we are? Mark: And you are ... Logan: Oh, sorry. Tyler Clementi. Are we dead? Mark: What do you think? Logan: Are we in Heaven? Mark: I don't think so. Logan: We're not in Hell. I mean, it's much too nice here. Have you seen God? I mean, is God here? Mark: Yeah. He's right over there with Santa and those elf guys that make all the toys. Logan: Dumb question. Mark: Very. Logan: So, are there other people here? Mark: I don't know. Logan: So, what's your name? You might know that. Mark: Shepard. Logan: Hm, like the shepherds who watched their flocks by night, and followed a shining star to Bethlehem? Mark: No, more like the shepherds that worked their asses off all day, chasing sheep around so they could sheer them or sell them or eat them for dinner. Logan: And liked their sheep a little too much? Matthew Shepard. Oh, my God. Excuse that ... Not the Matthew Shepard from Wyoming. Mark: Bingo. Logan: I remember there was an incident. Mark: Yeah, an incident. Maybe for you. Logan: I'm sorry. Really sorry. I was only a child. You're gay. What happened? Mark: You're gay? Logan: I was. Mark: And now you're not? Logan: Well, now I'm dead. Mark: Right. Logan: So, what happened? Mark: I was doing the Community College thing. One night I was out at a bar, not too far from campus, and these two guys offered to give me a ride home. I wasn't sure just why, just a kind gesture, I thought. Logan: Did they think you were gay? Mark: Some people in Laramie knew, some didn't. Most could care less. I was in a bit of a fog. Poor judgment maybe, maybe no judgment. Logan: Maybe alcohol. Mark: I hopped into their truck and off we went. The next thing I knew, one of them was punching me in the face, then dragged me over to a fence and tied me to it. They kicked the shit out of me, and pounded my face with a tire iron until my brain was mush! They found me there the next morning, half frozen, half naked, half dead. An ambulance took me to the hospital to linger. I guess, waiting to come here. Logan: Why did they pick you? Mark: Because they hate us. Because they can't accept that we're normal. Logan: Are we? Mark: Look around. Is there a place on earth where you don't find gays, except maybe Iran? Some people think they can justify their anger and their hate with the word &quot;choice&quot;. Hell, maybe you can choose what you want to major in at college or who you want to marry, but you can't choose whether you're gay or straight, any more than you can choose the color of your eyes or the size of your dick. I'm sorry. You should see me when I really get going. Tell me something about yourself. Logan: I can't. Mark: Can't? Then I 'm outta here. Logan: Wait! I want to talk with you. I'm just afraid. Mark: Afraid? What do you have to fear? You're dead. Logan: Every time I share my feelings about who I really am with anyone, I get hurt. (sighs) And every time I hide who I am, I hurt even more. Mark: I'm not going to hurt you. Come over here. Logan: How much do you want to know? Mark: I want to know how you got here. Logan: I was a student in my Freshman year at Rutgers. I was a music major in fine arts. I play the violin, I have since I was a child. Mark: Do you play well? Logan: Yeah, I guess, for my age. Mark: Would you play for me? Logan: Well, I would, if I had my violin, but I didn't bring it with me. (violin music) Mark: Wow. I mean, wow! Logan: Thanks. Mark: So, you were at college. Logan: I lived in a dorm with a roommate. Mark: Gay? Logan: No. I don't think so. Who knows? He probably thought I was gay. No football talk, no girls in and out, a neat freak. Mark: Was he worried that his friends would think he was gay if he roomed with a gay guy? Logan: I don't really know what he was thinking. One afternoon, I asked him if we could have our room to myself from 9 until midnight. I told him I wanted to have a friend over. He was okay with it. Mark: A &quot;friend&quot;? Logan: Busted! I met a guy on the Internet, a student in the drama department. Josh. Mark: Cute? Logan: I liked the way he looked and what he had to say. We both liked classical music, and I wanted to get to know him better. Mark: You could have just gone out for coffee. Logan: Could have. Didn't. You know, there's always this fantasy that something wonderful is going to happen. Maybe love. I wanted to be ready. Mark: Did he show up? Logan: Right on time, and I was just so wanting to be with another guy. We talked. We talked too much, and then, &quot;Bam!&quot; I can't remember all the details. The clothes came off, and we hugged, and- Mark: I get the picture. Logan: Then he left. I was so happy, like really hard to get to sleep happy, thinking where this might go. Mark: And this killed you? Logan: No. Mark: So your roommate knew what happened, came back at midnight, and stabbed you to death in a homophobic rage? Logan: No. Mark: Then what? Logan: The next morning, as I walked through the campus, I noticed something was different. It was strange. People's reactions. Mark: Maybe it was love. That can change everything. Logan: I wish it was love, but it wasn't. My roommate had hidden a video camera in our room, and streamed my date on the Internet. Mark: Very funny. What really happened? Logan: Not very funny. The bastard really did it. Mark: Fuck. Logan: I didn't know where to turn. I didn't know how to explain any of this to my family, my friends, or Josh. Mark: So you went back to your roommate to kill him, and he got the upper hand? Logan: No, I wish I had. I didn't know what to do. Mark: How could he do this? Logan: It doesn't matter. I just wanted to be alone so I didn't have to explain me to anyone. I was in real pain. Mark: I don't want to hear this. Logan: I left the dorm and just sat dazed in my car, trying to understand. Nothing. So I drove over to the George Washington Bridge. Mark: I don't want to hear this. Logan: I had my laptop with me, and I sent one last message that I was sorry for being ... Mark: Being? Logan: Then, I walked out onto the bridge. It vibrated with the sounds of passing cars and trucks. The fumes of dust and wind made it surreal. I was scared, but here was a way I could wash away this shame, the terror, everything. Mark: You jumped? Logan: No, not exactly. I wanted to see if God would save me. I wanted him to accept me as I was. I took a step forward, a test. I tried to fly like an angel, arms spread wide over the Hudson. Mark: How could you? Logan: Fly? Mark: You didn't step off that bridge. You were pushed. Logan: No, I was alone. Mark: Pushed by every asshole who thinks we're a threat to their screwed-up version of the world. I wish I could've stood with you on that bridge. We wouldn't be here today. Tyler, you told a terrible lie, that it's better to be dead than gay. Logan: So, you think I did the wrong thing? Mark: (laughs) Can we dance? Logan: I'm not much of a dancer. Mark: I'm not either. It's not like this is &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;. It's more like, dancing in the stars. (violin music) Do you like cowboys? Logan: Are you a cowboy? (applause) Professor: Nice, very nice. Don't forget about Death of a Salesman by next Wednesday. We'll chat about this scene at our next class. (organ music) Betty: You can do this now, as you're gonna cut around the outside. Now, if you do something that is against Jesus' teachings, what happens? Boy: You go to Hell and the Devil hurts you. It's very hot. Betty: Very good. No one here wants to go to Hell, do they? Only evil people go to Hell, people who don't accept Jesus Christ as their savior. Girl: But if you do what God tells you, you can join Him in Heaven, or Jesus, and there are angels. Betty: Yes, beautiful angels that you can live with forever. That is the reward for doing what the Bible teaches us. (rock music) ■ (lyrics) Truth be told you can get to be ■ Just be who you are so naturally ■ Just be who you are so ... ■ Ken: Sorry, guys. I was shooting video in the park. Perfect day! Brandon: Sorry, guys! I was shooting video of everything in the universe in my bedroom. (rimshot) Ken: Well, you guys won't be laughing when I do this music video and Ellen Degeneres calls. Mark: Uh, hi, Ken. It's Ellen. Would you like to sleep with Portia? I do. Oh, and about that video you sent ... Logan: Just pick up your damn bass and let's make some music. Ken: What are we doing? Brandon: Let's go back to &quot;Danny Boy&quot;. Logan: Not very original. Brandon: Our interpretation is. Think Coleman's Irish Pub. I talked to him, okay? A real gig. Logan: Good enough. Mark: 1, 2, 3. (upbeat rock music) ■ (lyrics) Oh, Danny boy ■ The pipes, the pipes are calling ■ From glen to glen and down the mountainside ■ The summer's gone and all the flowers are dying ■ It's you, it's you must go, and I must fight ■ Mayor: Corruption starts here. What can I do for you? Dan: I believe I need a permit to use the Marina Park, Your Honor. Mayor: Dan, cut the ingratiating flattery. If you really want something, hand me money! Dan: I forgot. Mayor: So, how are things going at Upstate during this too long of a recession. Dan: Well, things are going just okay. We're trying some new stuff to build revenue. Mayor: You're starting a cruise that will kick off in our marina. You know, it's this kind of micro-innovation that this town needs. That will help out the hotels, the restaurants, the 10 million gift shops, and on it goes. The real industries in this town are gone or going. Dan: I hear you. Mayor: We don't even know what to teach the kids in school anymore. If you'll answer a few questions, I'll get this application over to Commissioner Banks. Do you need of the following, electric service? Dan: Yes. Mayor: Water? Dan: Yes. Mayor: You'll need proof of insurance. Dan: I'll get that over to you by fax later today. Mayor: To Commissioner Banks, if you please. Is this event open to the public? Dan: No, it's a welcoming, uh, party for cruise guests only. Mayor: That's okay, but there'll be a $100 a day use fee, payable in advance. Dan: I'll get you a check before I leave. You know, that's about as much money as I can spend without Sarah's permission. Mayor: (laughs) It's good to have a woman in charge of the purse strings. Dan: And everything else. Mayor: Bad boy. So, you should be all set, young man. I'll get this over to the Commissioner, and you should hear from him by tomorrow. Dan: Thank you. Mayor: So, am I invited? Dan: There's always room for the mayor. Perhaps you could give a speech since it's our first departure from Palmyra. Mayor: Hmm, maybe we could even get some media coverage. Always helps in an election year. So, what are the things that are special about this cruise? What key points will help Upstate? Dan: Well, it's the first gay cruise to be offered on the Erie, as far as I know. Here's the brochure that Libby's been working on. Mayor: Hm. Now, this is interesting. (phone rings) Reverend: Damn. Reverend Scholder here. Oh, hi Betty, how are you doing? Great, and the kids? Betty: Oh, they're fine, except Tara, who is worried about the Holy Ghost. You know how little girls are. Reverend: Betty, I really appreciate the work you're doing in Bible School. Now, why do I have the pleasure of talking with you this lovely morning? Betty: Reverend, I'd really like to speak with you in person. Reverend: Betty, I hope this isn't about your salary for next year. You know how the church is stretched. Betty: No, it's about some younger church members. Reverend: Okay. Would you like to stop by here tomorrow morning? Betty: Will Brandon be there? Reverend: I doubt it. There's school, practice, and whatever kids do. Do you want him here? Betty: No, that'll be fine. I'll see you in the morning. Reverend: See you. Peter: Okay, and you guys are the Bi-Polar Bears. Bear: Right you are! Thanks for having us here! I'd introduce the band members, but we're kind of private. We don't want fans chasing us down after the show. You know how it is. Being famous is difficult. Guys? We're ready to play. Peter: Okay, let's do it! Bear: We picked this little number special for the cruise and all. Peter: Great. (Music: Anchors Aweigh) Peter: Okay, good choice. It's very ... maritime. Bear: You know, we also do comedy too to bring the crowds in. Here's a little something for you. What's the shortest joke in the English language? I'm off drugs. (rimshot) Mark: Good evening, Mr. Wiles. Thank you for allowing us to audition. Let me introduce the group to you. On keyboards, we have Brandon. On bass guitar, Ken. Lead guitar is Logan, and I'm Mark, doing all the percussion stuff. Do you have any questions for us? Peter: You know the performance will be spread over a few days. This is a gay cruise, and much of the time will be spent playing on a boat. Mark: We do. Peter: Okay, so whenever you guys are ready. (music: Open Eyes) ■ (lyrics) I look at you, you look at me ■ We seem to feel the same way ■ Or is it all just hopeless lies ■ I think that you are just like me ■ It's safe to say we are the same ■ A face behind a thin disguise ■ Love can heal you, love can steal you ■ Break you, use you, look right through you ■ Love can break your heart, it's no surprise ■ Jump right in with open eyes ■ True love dies when eyes are closed ■ To see a love's deceit ■ Open up to love to true emotion ■ Let it flow right through you ■ Jump right in with open eyes ■ Open eyes ■ I look at you, you look at me ■ We seem to feel the same way ■ Just jump right in with open eyes ■ Mark: Would you like us to play something else? Perhaps a standard, maybe. Peter: No, if you want the gig, it's yours. Mark: Yes. Yes, definitely. we definitely want it. Betty: Thank you, Reverend. Reverend: So, what's up? Betty: Well, I was walking past the choir room, and I looked in, you know, just to make sure things were okay, and I saw Logan kissing someone. Reverend: Betty, there's nothing wrong with kissing, even in the church. Betty: Reverend, he was kissing another boy. Reverend: A boy? Are you sure? Betty: Quite. Reverend: Well, that's different. Did any of your students see anything? Betty: No, they'd all been sent home for the day. Reverend: Thank goodness. Did you say anything to Logan? Logan Betting? Betty: Heavens, no! You're the first person I've come to. Reverend: The Bible takes a pretty dim view of this type of behavior. I'll talk to him. Betty: There's more. Reverend: More? Betty: Logan was kissing ... Brandon. Reverend: My Brandon? My son? That's impossible! He isn't ... Betty: I saw what I saw! Reverend: Betty, please don't talk to anyone about this. I need to, I, I need to find the truth. (phone rings) Dan: Hello. Commissioner: Good morning, Dan. Commissioner Banks here. Dan: Commissioner, good morning. I was hoping to hear from you. How are we doing on the permit? Commissioner: The mayor tells me we're going to have a public hearing. Dan: When is this meeting? Commissioner: A week from today, 1 p.m., in the Village Hall. Dan: Because a couple of gay people are coming to town. Commissioner: I guess. Dan: (sighs) You know, I suspected a couple are already there. They ought to put a sign out on Route 20 that says no Blacks, Jews, Hispanics, Muslims, or gays allowed. Commissioner: I'm really sorry about this, Dan, but let's just see how things go. (knocking) Reverend: Brandon? (suspenseful music) What have I done wrong? We need you, Claire. I think we need you more than God right now. (door closes) Reverend: Home early. Brandon: I guess, a little. Are we going out to eat? Reverend: Sure. I need to make a couple of calls. Where have you been? Brandon: At practice. Reverend: Practice, the band? Brandon: Yup. Reverend: Logan Betting is in your band, isn't he? Brandon: Last I knew. Dan: This really surprises me. Sarah: Word has it the Reverend devoted part of his sermon on Sunday to, and I quote, &quot;The Gay Plague&quot;, and he wasn't talking about AIDS. Dan: I think the Reverend is losing it. Too much Bible reading. Sarah: I've got a bad feeling that some of his flock followed him here tonight. Dan: You know what Dad always said? Church is for those who need it most. (side conversations) Brandon: Why am I here? Reverend: You're here because you're my son and a member of our church, and because you don't want a boatload of homosexuals congregating in the middle of our town, right? Brandon: Doesn't the Constitution give citizens the right to assemble? Reverend: Not here, if I have anything to say about it. This is a battle we can win. (Mayor bangs gavel) Mayor: Good evening, and thank you all for being here. Let me cut right to the reason for this meeting. Commissioner Banks has a request for a park use permit from Upstate Cruise Lines. During the permit review, concern was expressed by Reverend Scholder, saying that the citizens of Palmyra should be allowed to provide input since granting the permit might run contrary to community values, as he put it. So, this meeting is a part of the review process. At this time, I would like to invite Dan, from Upstate, to say a few words. Dan? Dan: Your honor, board members, community. Good evening. Let me begin by saying that I was surprised that this meeting was called as part of the permit Reverend: He's probably gay. Dan: It seems to be such a simple matter. Dan: We've met all the Dan: requirements for a permit to be issued. I'm just asking that our request be honored, as is set forth in the Village's Rules and Regulations. I would urge the board to end this meeting at this time and approve our request. Thank you. Mayor: We understand your request, but we did offer Reverend Scholder the opportunity to speak, which he accepted, Dan: Big surprise. Mayor: I'd like to invite Reverend Scholder to the microphone, after which we will accept input from all present. Reverend? Reverend: First, let me indicate my extreme disappointment that we did not open this meeting with a prayer. We all need His guidance. Your Honor, Board Members, assembled friends, we are faced with an issue that rises above, far above the Town's written Rules and Regulations. Do we want to approve bringing a boatload of gay people into our marina? We don't know how they'll behave. Do we want our children to see men holding hands with other men, or hugging, Dan: I feel like I'm at Dan: the Scopes Monkey Trial. Reverend: Do we want to answer our children's questions about these people? Can we, as good Christians, say to them that we allowed these perverted people into our community when our Holy Bible tells us that their behavior is an abomination? Of course not. This right to determine our village's moral posture is the very reason a permit is required. God-fearing people have the right to protect themselves. I and my congregation ask that you support God's law, and deny Upstate's request. Thank you. Mayor: I want to thank you all for coming. We will accept written input through tomorrow at noon after which time the permit will be either denied or granted. Good night. (suspenseful music) Officer Burkett: Please put your vehicle in park, set the emergency brake, and turn off your engine. Do you have any weapons in the vehicle? Logan: No, Officer. Officer Burkett: I need to see your driver's license and registration, sir. Do you know why I pulled you over? Logan: Because you don't have anything better to do? Officer Burkett: Please step out of the vehicle. Keep your hands where I could see them. Logan: I'm sorry, Officer. I was only joking. Officer Burkett: Step out of the car, now. Turn to face the vehicle, hands behind your back. Logan: What have I done? Officer Burkett: You're driving without tail lights. Logan: I didn't know. Officer Burkett: Now you do. Do I have your permission to inspect the vehicle and its contents? Logan: Sure. I didn't mean to be disrespectful. Officer Burkett: What's in this bag? Logan: Just some clothes, some school stuff. Officer Burkett: Is this school stuff? Logan: That's not mine. I don't know where that came from! Officer Burkett: Right. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. Clerk: Logan Betting? Logan: Yes. Clerk: Am I correct that you've been read your Miranda Rights? Logan: Yes, but I haven't done anything. Clerk: Just answer my questions, son. Do you have a lawyer? Logan: I haven't done anything. I've, Ive ... This is a mistake! Clerk: Right, just answer the questions, and this will be over a lot sooner. Do you have a lawyer? Logan: No, sir. Clerk: Is there anyone you want to call? Logan: I don't know. Clerk: Your parents? A friend? Anyone? Well, when you do know, you get one call. Holding room B, the usual. Officer Burkett: Let's go. Logan: Am I going to jail? Officer Burkett: No, you're not going to jail. You're in jail. As far as I can tell, you're not going anywhere. (beeps) (click) Please remove your clothes, into the bag. (dramatic music) Keep going. Put your arms out to your sides and spread your legs apart. Open. Wider. I need to check for contraband, so I need you to bend forward. Logan: I don't have contraband. I haven't done anything. Don't you understand? Officer Burkett: Son, I'm just doing my job. Now, bend forward. Clear. Special disinfectant. Kills everything. Hopefully, you'll survive. Do everything, including your hair. Logan: You're going to watch? Officer Burkett: Boy, in jail, you're always being watched. By the guards, by the TV cameras, by the other inmates, so get used to it. Instructor: This lab is like detective show on television. You like, right? You have been given five envelopes of white powder samples. Each one has a letter on it. You received this last lab from your TA. Now, over the next two weeks, you must identify these powders Barbara: I only see 4 samples. Instructor: and chemical analysis. Instructor: Questions? Brandon: Oh, no. Brandon: Barbara, we're missing E. Brandon: We're gonna flunk chemistry. Our lives are over! Barbara: Shut up! Barbara: Now, how do you lose something Barbara: from a bundle? Brandon: Bad parenting, that's it. Barbara: Okay, I'll ask for another E, Barbara: but now you owe me. Brandon: Barbara, Brandon: you be the man. Barbara: You be the ass. Instructor: In China, we say, &quot;Only taste if we identify a wine.&quot; (students laugh) Officer Burkett: Good morning, Reverend. Tim Burkett here. Reverend: Good morning, Tim. Officer Burkett: I'm calling to let you know that your suspicions about Logan Betting appear to have been correct. I stopped him last night without tail lights. Perfect excuse, and he had what appears to be church property. I'll need you to come down and identify the stuff. Reverend: No problem. Officer Burkett: Why did you suspect Logan? I'm trying to understand this case. Reverend: Well, a chalice disappeared a couple of weeks ago. Officer Burkett: Did you see Logan take it? Reverend: I didn't know who at first, but then I remembered him putting a duffle bag in his car, and it just came to me that this might be the chalice, like a message from God. Officer Burkett: How's 9 this morning? Reverend: Good. Officer Burkett: See you then. A message from God? Haven't had one of those lately. (knocking) Doctor: Bran-don? How are you doing? Brandon: Okay, I guess. Doctor: Good. Wow, I've been seeing you for about 20 years. Seems like yesterday. Looks like you're due for a tetanus booster. I'll have the nurse do one before you leave. Any medical questions? Anything bothering you? Brandon: I don't think so. Doctor: Anyone special in your life? Brandon: Not really. You know how important it is to practice safe sex. Condoms, disease testing of potential partners and the like? Brandon: I do. Doctor: I think we should do some blood work today. Check the usual stuff, also check for STDs and HIV, if that's okay with you. Brandon: Why? Doctor: To establish a baseline. Arm. Brandon, what passes between us is totally confidential, and I'm in an awkward place. It's partly my fault. Brandon: Meaning? Doctor: Meaning your father called me. Brandon: Why? Doctor: Just a second. It's very good. He's concerned that you might be involved with a guy. Brandon: A guy? He said that? Doctor: Yes. Brandon: Why? Doctor: I don't know, but he asked that I look into it as a personal favor. Brandon: And you're doing it? Doctor: Not really. I'm here for you. Brandon: So what are you going to tell him? Doctor: I'm thinking. He's a difficult man to allude. Brandon: Do you know why he thinks I'm gay? Doctor: No. Are you? Brandon: Yes. Maybe you should recheck my blood pressure. Officer Burkett: Thank you. So, how's my best little girl tonight? Barbara: She's in college. She's 18 years old, and hopes to be a physician. Officer Burkett: Any numbers in your classes that I should be worried about? Barbara: I don't think so, Daddy. Of course, there is Brandon Scholder. Officer Burkett: The minister's son? Barbara: That's the one. He's my lab partner. Officer Burkett: Biology or chemistry? Barbara: Chemistry. Officer Burkett: Who's smarter? Barbara: Dad! That's not politically correct. Officer Burkett: So? Barbara: He lost one of the samples we were supposed to identify. Officer Burkett: Hm. Sounds like police lab work, identifying stuff. Want me to get you a job here? Barbara: Oh, you don't know how much I want to work for my Dad in the police lab. Officer Burkett: Do I detect a note of sarcasm? So, did you find the sample? Hope it wasn't urine! Barbara: Dad! We got a replacement from Dr. Zewei. Officer Burkett: So, what was it? Barbara: Don't know yet. Just white powder E so far. Rick: What you staring at? Logan: Nothing! Rick: You be checkin' out these guns, huh? Logan: No. Rick: No? Hell yeah! Nice, huh? Logan: Yeah, nice. Rick: Go on, touch that bad boy. Logan: No, thank you. Rick: I wasn't asking you to touch it. I was telling you. You understand? Atta boy. (loud foghorn-type noise) Logan: What was that? Rick: Could have been a guy getting the chair. So I've heard. Logan: But this is a jail. They don't kill people here. Rick: Yes, they do. Real prison's next door. I know that. Logan: So what did you do? Rick: What you mean? Logan: To be put in jail? Rick: Jail, right. I asked my bud for a favor. A real personal favor. He says, &quot;No.&quot; So I pulled out my gun, and I asked him again. The fool still says, &quot;No,&quot; so I put it to his head. I said, &quot;What?&quot; He got all scared, so I shot him. Logan: Oh, my God. Rick: I mean, that's what he was expecting, right? Wishing for something and BAM, it comes true. Logan: So, you killed somebody, and you're in this jail? Rick: Right now I am, can't you see? Smile pretty. Watch this. Logan: Won't the guards notice that? Rick: I doubt it. Maybe tomorrow. You warm? Logan: I'm okay, thanks. (door slams) Rick: You look warm. Logan: I'm okay. Rick: In fact, you look hot. Logan: No, I'm ... What are you saying? Rick: You know what I'm saying, and you're going to do what I say. Logan: Please, don't. Rick: What about &quot;pretty please&quot;? What's your name? Logan: Logan. You don't want to do this. Guards will come. Rick: Not if you're quiet, Logan, and you are going to be very quiet, Logan. I'm going to help you. Logan: Please, don't. I can get you money. Rick: Stop acting like a baby. I don't fuck babies. Logan: Please, I'm in school! Rick: Pull your shorts down, or do you want me to do it? You smell so good, not like prison. You look damn good for a White boy. Logan: Please, I beg you, don't do this. Rick: You're not scared of Rick, are you? Logan: Yes, I'm scared. Please stop, Please! Rick: Okay. Logan: Okay? Rick: I said, &quot;Okay,&quot; didn't I? Pull up your clothes. You're a mess. (loud buzzer) Rick: You need to get cleaned up. You're going to have a visitor in an hour. Salesman: Good afternoon, how might we help you? Reverend: Good afternoon. I'm looking to buy a gun. I've never bought one before. Salesman: No problem. You've come to the right place. Now, what type of gun are you looking for? Reverend: A pistol. I was robbed recently. Salesman: Real sorry to hear that. Protection is real important. You know, your life could be at stake or that of your family. Here, hold this. Reverend: Is this loaded? Salesman: No, none of these are. What do you think? Reverend: What? Salesman: How does it feel? This is a Glock 17, 9-millimeter, probably the first choice of policemen all over the world. (gunshot) This is a really dependable weapon. We sell lots of them. Reverend: I'll take it. Salesman: You're fast, and you've made the right choice. Give the bad guys what they deserve. (chuckles) We need to do some paperwork, and if you're clean, you can take it right away with you. Can I see your driver's license and some other form of identification ... (organ music) Reverend: God, I know you are leading me in the right direction. Please have mercy on me. Amen. (cocks gun) Brandon. (music stops) Brandon: Oh, God. You scared me. Reverend: I'm sorry. Do you want to go get some pizza? Brandon: Pizza? Sure. Reverend: I know we don't spend enough time together, and I regret that. Brandon: It's okay. I wish we got to spend more time together, but you're busy with the church, and I'm busy with college and the band. Reverend: Excuses don't make a family. So, is everything okay at school? Brandon: The teachers are great, and I should be on the Dean's list this semester. Reverend: I'm proud of you. Mom would be proud of you. So many young people around your age get into trouble. Drugs, sex. Brandon: Drugs are bad. Reverend: Sometimes, young people experiment with ... Well, with things that are dangerous. Brandon: Like guns? (laughs) Reverend: You know that's not what I mean. I have to ask you a question, and it's difficult for me. Brandon: Are you worried that I'm gay? Reverend: Yes, I am. Brandon: Where does this come from? Reverend: That's not important, but I need to know. Brandon: Yes, I'm gay. Reverend: Don't worry. I'm going to get you help. Brandon: I don't need help. I don't want help. Reverend: Son, this violates the teaching of the Holy Bible. It's very specific here. Men do not lie down with men. Brandon: But they do, and it's wonderful. Reverend: It's not wonderful. It's perverted. Brandon: Love is love. Reverend: With your band friend? Brandon: Yes, with my band friend. Reverend: You're not one of those people. We're going to get help. Jesus loves you. Brandon: That's rad. Reverend: Don't be sarcastic. Brandon: Can you accept a gay son? Reverend: You're confused. You're not gay. Brandon: Some men and some women are. I am one of them. It's that simple. Reverend: I don't want to argue, but I need you to do one thing for me. Brandon: What? Officer Burkett: Come on in, Reverend. Sit down. This may be more serious than we thought. All depends on this. Theft and drugs often go together. Reverend: How do young people get started down the wrong road? It's heartbreaking. Officer Burkett: They make some bad choices, I guess. Now, is this church property? Oh, don't touch. Reverend: Indeed, and they're really priceless. Purchased over 100 years ago with a collection from the first congregation. Officer Burkett: Well, it looks like we found our man. Maybe you should have been a detective. (clock ticking) Joyce: Brandon, I presume? Brandon: Right. Joyce: Come on in. (door opens) Have a seat wherever you wish. Brandon: Does my choice tell you something about me? Joyce: I don't think so, or I missed that class in med school. So, how are you? Brandon: I'm okay. How are you? Joyce: I'm just fine, but no more personal questions, please. Brandon: Just one. Joyce: I may have to report you to the Difficult Patients Unit. Brandon: Are you gay, or a lesbian at least? Joyce: Why do you ask? Brandon: I want someone who can understand me. Joyce: Ahh. If I had to share my patient's disorders to help them, I'd be pretty messed up. Brandon: Dad made me come here. Joyce: I know. Brandon: So, do I get to quote what you say in arguments with him? Joyce: Only if you're more accurate than the reporters at Fox. Brandon: That shouldn't be difficult. Joyce: So, for the record, do you believe you're gay? Brandon: Yes. Joyce: Are you okay with being gay? Brandon: Pretending hurts. I mean, am I so bad that I have to lie about who I am? Joyce: What do you think will happen if you're openly gay? Brandon: After Dad kills me? I'll lose friends, or they'll treat me differently, talk about me, avoid me. I don't know, but it won't be good. Joyce: Do you blame any one for your being gay? Brandon: My uncle, no not really. Joyce. Brandon, current research suggests that homosexuality is just a normal occurrence in our species. Five percent of the population is gay, and there's little doubt that it's to our genetic makeup. Brandon: Yeah, but Dad's upset. Joyce: I know, but his disappointment is not your problem. Brandon: So, what are you going to have me do? Joyce: Well, nothing. Oh, learn about safe sex, unless you already know the ropes. Brandon: I do. Joyce: So, here's my card, if you want to talk with me further. Brandon: We're done? Joyce: Well, you can't fix something that's not broken. (knocks) Officer Burkett: Yup. Officer: Got last week's report, sir. Officer Burkett: Thanks. Anything interesting? Officer: Not really. The Reverend got a pistol permit. Officer Burkett: Reverend Scholder? Officer: Yes, sir. I hope he's not going after people who haven't attended his services. Officer Burkett: Praise the Lord and pass the ammo. This may be some overreaction to the robbery. Officer: A little over the top, if you ask me. Officer Burkett: I just hope he gets some training before someone gets hurt. Anything else? Officer: Lab reports. I figured you'd want to review them yourself. Officer Burkett: Thanks. Officer: No problem. Officer Burkett: Well, I'll be. Mayor: Dannie, it's your favorite Mayor calling. Dan: Well, that depends on what you have to say. Mayor: I'm positively hurt. Dan: You know I'm just fooling around. Mayor: Approved is the word for the day. Dan: (sighs) Thank god, and that's with a small g. Was it close? Mayor: Not even. Just because we're a small town doesn't mean we're stupid, and we try to protect the minority from the tyranny of the majority. That grade school &quot;majority rules&quot; stuff is as out of style as last year's iPhone. Dan: I really appreciate this. Mayor: And because I'm your favorite Mayor, I'll give the other towns a heads up. Us big crooks stick together like the Mafia. Did I say that? Dan: I didn't hear a thing. Mayor: (lauhgs) Later, boy. Now get our tourism engines revved up! Dan: I'll do my best. Thanks, again. (music) Driver: We should be there in about an hour, if you trust the GPS. Passenger: Oh, now this is interesting. Palmyra is, quote, &quot;The Queen of Canal Towns&quot;. Driver: Really? Passenger: Really, how fitting. Do you think the Captain can marry us during the cruise? Driver: You haven't even met him, and besides he'd have to be a bigamist to marry us. Passenger: Asshole, I mean marry us. You and me to each other. Driver: Duh. You know, this is the place where the Mormon Church was founded, so perhaps the Captain could have 2 spouses. I'll ask Mitt. Passenger: Enough. Do you know what they call 100 Republicans at the bottom of the ocean? Driver: A quorum? Passenger: A good start. Passenger: Hey, some of our best friends are Republicans. Driver: Your best friends. Passenger: That's not true. Politically incorrect and almost totally baseless. Passenger: Almost. I still want to get married. Driver: It'll happen. Some day we'll be as smart as they are in Canada. Passenger: I hope. (lively music) Mark: Our first big gig, Buddy boy! Brandon: Not exactly Madison Square Garden, but it's money. Mark: Yeah, gay for pay. I wonder what kind of tips we'll get. Brandon: Don't go there. Mark: Oh, sure, protect the homos. Brandon: Stop. No, no, no no. I mean, stop, right there. Mark: Yeah, boss? The equipment gonna set itself up? Hello? Brandon: I'm gay. Mark: Right, and I'm Eminem. Not the candy, but the rapper, I mean. Brandon: I'm serious. Mark: I guess I'll have to kill the fag. Brandon: Is that how you feel? Mark: Brandon, this isn't news. I know you're gay. Half the school knows you're gay. The Terracotta Warriors in China, they know. Half the universe knows. Brandon: What? Why didn't you tell me? Mark: Well, call me stupid, but I thought that you knew you were gay. Brandon: Not that. Mark: and you like a guy. Brandon: Does Ken know? Mark: Is the Pope Catholic? Brandon: Fuck! Mark: If the boat leaves without us and we're not set up, that's fuck, so ... Brandon: You don't care? Mark: Of course I care ... about getting set up on time! Brandon: Not about ... Mark: After Lorri, it's you, sort of.. Come on! Glenn: I know we're going to have a really, really great time at this concert, but this is a real small town, and I'm not sure how the local folks are going to react to us. They did buy tickets. We're sold out tonight! (cheering) Okay, now we've only got 3 hours to load in, so we'll go right from the bus, right into the rehearsal room, directly onto the stage. We're going to have to make the best use of the time that we've got, all right? Ken: If I post some of this on You Tube, it should get us some gigs. Mark: Or hot dates. Logan: Or an Emmy, or Oscar, or whatever TV shows get. Ken: Emmy it is. HD from port to port. So you animals better behave yourselves. We're rolling. (music: We Belong Together) ■ (lyrics) I don't care what they may say about us ■ Think about us ■ I don't mind if people say that we won't last until the day we die ■ I know that I belong to you ■ You belong to me ■ We belong together, no matter what the world may say or do ... Barbara: So I made you something special for dessert. Burkett: How much do you need? Barbara: I'm hurt! Burkett: Not likely. What is it? Banana: Creamy, very creamy rice pudding with cinnamon and rum-soaked raisins. Officer Burkett: Let's skip the rest of dinner. So, did you get your lab work finished? &quot;No, I don't want to work for you,&quot; daughter of mine? Barbara: Yes. Brandon and I triumphed as usual. The final sample, stand-by applause, the lost but found E, more applause, was diatomaceous earth! Yes! Officer Burkett: Are you sure? Barbara: Did Madame Curie know when she discovered radium? Officer Burkett: Damned if I know. Do you know anything about Brandon's father? Barbara: He's a minister, but you know that. I think he and his dad aren't getting along right now, but I don't know why, and he's playing with a band that's playing on a gay cruise. Daddy, don't we need a cruise? Officer Burkett: When the money train pulls in. Barbara: In fact, I think they're supposed to be on the boat tonight for practice as it heads to Palmyra. Officer Burkett: I heard about this. Honey, will you excuse me? I need to go to the office. Barbara: But what about the pudding? Officer Burkett: It'll be my bedtime treat. Barbara: Love you! Officer Burkett: Love you more! Barbara: Love you to infinity and beyond. (lively music) Officer Burkett: Betty, did he say where he was going? Betty: No. He was looking for that cruise boat with Brandon, but he didn't say where. Is something wrong? Officer Burkett: I don't know. Did he seem upset or anything? Betty: Like what? Officer Burkett: Anything! Betty: Well, he and Brandon haven't been getting along lately. Officer Burkett: Do you know why? Betty: I do, but I can't say. Officer Burkett: Betty, this is very important. Did you know that the Reverend bought a gun? Betty: Oh my, no. Why would he do something like that? Officer Burkett: I wish I knew. Now, once again, what's the issue with Brandon? I need to know right now. i'm a police officer, understand? Betty: Well, you mustn't tell anyone. The Reverend found out recently that Brandon is gay, might be gay, and he has a boyfriend, if you know what I mean, and he hasn't been the same since. The Reverend, that is. Officer Burkett: Who's the boyfriend? Betty: Logan Betting, one of the boys from the band. I really shouldn't be telling you any of this. Officer Burkett: Look, if you talk to the Reverend, have him give me a call. Tell him it's important, got it? Reverend: Our Father who art in Heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done on Earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. (phone rings) Dan: Captain Dan Wiles here, may I help you? Officer Burkett: Dan, this is Officer Burkett. Dan: Oh, hi. How's it going? Officer Burkett: You tell me. Anything unusual? Dan: No, not really. We have a band on board. We're just relocating over to Palmyra for tomorrow's cruise. Officer Burkett: Right. Where are you now? Dan: Leaving lock 30. Officer Burkett: Where's the next bridge? Dan: Towpath Road. Why all the questions? Is there a problem? Officer Burkett: I hope not. Give me a call if you see anything unusual. Have a safe trip. Dan: Okay, thanks Tim. Glenn: Wow, that theater is amazing. It's going to sound incredible. It's going to be a great, great concert. Tell you what, let's warm up with &quot;Amazing Grace&quot;, all right? ■ (lyrics) Amazing grace, how sweet the sound ■ That saved a wretch like me ■ I once was lost, but now am found ■ Was blind, but now I see ■ 'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear ■ And grace my fears relieved ■ How precious did that grace appear ■ The hour I first believed ■ Through many dangers, toils, and snares ■ I have already known ■ 'Tis grace that brought me safe thus far ■ And grace will lead me home ■ (gunshot) Dan: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Go check on the band. Jimmy: All right. Logan: What was that? Mark: Loud, man. Jimmy: Are you guys all right? Jimmy: Captain, everything seems Okay. No one knows what happened. Dan: Just keep looking around. Jimmy: Roger. Dan: Tim, you asked me to call if anything strange happened. (upbeat music) (phone rings) Officer Burkett: Come on, Reverend, pick up! (phone rings) Damn! Officer Burkett: Evan, this is going to be fast. Dispatch backup to the Church Street Bridge over the Canal. If they get there before I do, tell them to approach with caution. Suspect may be armed. Jerry, it's me. Tim Burkett. Reverend: Go away. Officer Burkett: I'm unarmed. What are you doing here? Reverend: I'm doing what God wants me to do. Don't come any closer. Officer Burkett: Look, no one's been hurt. Put the gun down, and everything will be okay. Reverend: I can't do that. Officer Burkett: Yes, you can. Reverend: I know what Betty told you. What if your daughter was in love with another woman? What would you do? Officer Burkett: She is, and I'm happy for her. Love is a gift, a gift from God. Reverend: You're lying to me. Officer Burkett: No, I'm not. Reverend: And you're okay with this, this perversion that the Lord condemns? Officer Burkett: She is who she is. He made her as he wanted. He gave her the love of another person. It's a blessing. Reverend: Stop moving! She's a sinner, and she'll be punished! Officer Burkett: Not by my God. My God is about love and acceptance and forgiving. Reverend: You need to read the Holy Bible. Officer Burkett: So what's your plan? To kill your son, to kill Logan? Reverend: My son will be okay if Logan is cast out! My life is expendable. I've been called to do this. Officer Burkett: Your son is okay. Logan is okay. Just put the gun down. You know we're friends. Reverend: We've talked long enough. Go home. Officer Burkett: Reverend, accept your son as he is. You and Claire raised a fine boy. He'll be okay. Let him be. Reverend: Be what? Officer Burkett: Be what God intended him to be! We don't know why things are as they are. Accept God's plan. Reverend: Too bad you don't have your gun. (gunshot) (suspenseful music) (heart beating) (machines beeping) Mark: We're getting ready to do our play for a high school group. the principal wanted some language changes, but Professor Mahler said, &quot;No way,&quot; and no way it is. Wish I had that kind of power. Afterwards, we'll get a chance to talk to the kids. Over here. (music: Two Hearts) ■ (lyrics) Two hearts are better than one ■ Make a difference and be the one to reach out give ■ Two hearts are better than one ■ When two hearts come alive ■ It'll be a better day ■ Pawn your heart for riches lost ■ Inside yourself, you'd pay the cost ■ A lonely one needs a companion ■ To be the one, one in a million ■ Helping others realize ■ Live your best lives, keep your dreams alive ■ Pay your dues because you have to ■ For happiness to ever find you ■ Two hearts are better than one ■ Make a difference ■ And be the one who shows the world you love ■ Two hearts are better than one ■ Make a difference and be the one to reach out and give ■ Two hearts are better than one ■ When two hearts come alive ■ It'll be a better day ■ Pawn your heart for riches lost ■ Inside yourself, you pay the cost ■ A lonely one needs a companion ■ To be the one, one in a million ■ Helping others realize ■ Live your best life, keep your dreams alive ■ Pay your dues because you have to ■ For happiness to ever find you ■ Two hearts are better than one ■ Make a difference ■ Be the one who shows the world you love ■ Two hearts are better than one ■ When two hearts intertwine ■ It'll be a better day ■ Two hearts are better than one ■ Make a difference ■ And be the one to reach out and give ■ Two hearts are better than one ■ Two hearts are better than one ■ Caring hearts sing a melody ■ Our hearts as one and keep the peace ■ Two hearts are better than one ■ Make a difference ■ Be the one to reach out and give ■ Two hearts are better than one ■ Make a difference ■ And be the one to show the world you love ■ Two hearts are better than one ■ When two hearts come alive ■ It'll be a better day ■ When two hearts come alive ■ It'll be a better day ■ It'll be a better day ■ It'll be a better day ■ It'll be a better day ■
