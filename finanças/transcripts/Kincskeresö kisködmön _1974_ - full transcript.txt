TREASURE SEEKING LITTLE JACKET Stop, villain! Are you on the watch for me? Are you eager about my treasure? I will flay you alive, turn you into a black buffalo, you rouge! I will let the griffins loose on you to cave your envious eyes! Stop son, are you rushing somewhere? Who chases you and makes you so scared? Kusmodi, he wants to turn me into a buffalo. Please do not let this happen, uncle Kalman! You aren't scared of that old fool, are you? I am! He punishes with his eyes, he voodoos me. You must have been spying on him, or have you also taken up treasure mining... like the old fool? No, but it would be good, if I found it. It's a vaste of time for anybody to look for it, if there was even a handful of coal there, I would not go mining elsewhere either. Well, calm down, he won't come after you. Go and seek that treasure somewhere else! Buy pear-music, sounds better than golden oriole! Buy pear-music! Whistling-tail pony! For 4 mites! Pear-music! Buy it! Sounds better than golden oriole! Buy pear-music! Do you like it, little boy? Whistling-tail pony! It costs 4 mites! 4 mites! Every child likes this. Buy it! The cotton candy costs 2 mites! Would you like one? Buy this! - How much does the egg cost, Kusmodi? - A mite for a pair. Aren't you afraid of God? Selling these tiny eggs so expensively... Tiny?! But how wonderful they are! Just blow on any and a silver pengo will grow in it immediately! But they are not for sale to you. I don't sale them to you for any money! This hen? Or would you like this capon? Which one do you prefer? I have just brought it. - On time! Did you rock Zsuzsika, my dear? - She is sleeping. Ferko! - Yes? You will whistle nicely from this. - Thank you. Well, Ferko! Bread or mite? Today mite. Thank you. I didn't hear the greeting! The cotton candy costs 2 mites. Come children buy and eat it, here you are! The candy cotton costs only 2 mites. Children, buy it and eat! Little boy, if you don't want it, someone else will... Here you are! Buy it! Buy it! Whistling-tail pony! Buy it! - I would like a pear-music. - The Pear-music costs 4 mites. Here is a beautiful one. - I have only 3 mites. - Three mites? Are you a good child? Well, I don't mind. Here is a colorless. But it is a wonder music... because it sounds only if a good child blows it. - Wonder music? Let me see, are you a good boy? I see you are a good boy. Keep playing it beautifully, boy! - You have a pear-music? Give it to me! - Take it away from him! - Give it to me! Let me have it! If you don't give it to me, I will slap you! Get out of here, you nasty kids! Stop villain! I'll kill you now! Be careful, Ferko! He will voodoo you! I will make the griffins scrape out your eyes! You, you! I will turn you into a pig if I catch you. I will break your neck! I am going to catch you! Listen to me, buddy! - You have such a nice music. - This is wonder music, doctor. The last thing we can do is wait. - Give it to me! - I don't! It's mine. I bought it from my own money. - Do you envy it from your sick sister? - Girls don't have sense of it. Darling...! I told you, haven't I? Go to hell! - Night shift, uncle Kalman? - Yes, my boy. Good afternoon, Prince Wind! Are you angry, Prince Wind? Change from fairy to a human being by the time I count to three. One... Two... Three! I will help you out in a minute! Where is the maidenhair, mother? It was here yesterday. What do you need it for, darling? - I want Prince Wind to show itself. - What do you want? I want to put maidenhair against its way. So it'll turn into a human. Where is the maidenhair? In the room. Be careful, not to wake Marika up! His poor head does not work the same way as other ordinary people's. I'm here, my darling, I'm right here, please don't cry! You are going to change into a human in a minute! And will conjure treasure for me. I put it on your way, and you will trip over it... Mother! Mother! Please come, somebody! Mother! Mother!... Mother! - What happened to you, my son? - Prince Wind kicked me off. What are you saying, little fool? Where is your mind again?! What did you do with your pants, Ferko? Your father will be very angry, I don't have enough patches. Hey, you'll catch cold. Go to bed, I'm up anyway. My blue-eyed child, she won't smile at her mother anymore. Oh my, I rocked your cradle yesterday, but tomorrow I will bury you in the sad black soil. You won't come out to the sunny day to be combed. You won't ask for your toys, dolls anymore, our little Marika. Oh, You don't need the music that your brother has played to you. Father, are we going to put Marika into the soil? - Yes. - When? - Tomorrow. And she will never come back from there? The tiny mate who loved you so much... Oh, if only God predicted it and could be able to help you. Oh, now you could run about with Ferko, you could play, my dear, my little weak sweetie. Oh, because death is blind, so it took you away too early. (pear-music doesn't sound) Oh, instead of a jacket, your father will make you a coffin. Your sad father... Poor soul, my daughter! It was in vain to waste this beautiful pumpkin. You can catch only rustic tit with it. - Why, are there other types, Godfather? - Well, I think so. The king of tits, that's something! You should catch that, because that brings luck to us. But not with a noble pumpkin, like this. Give it to me! - God bless you! - She is dead. What is the king of tits like, godfather? Does it have a crown? Yes, of course! It has blue crown, pink mantle, white vest, red boots, but the most outstanding feature of this bird is the long, velvet beard. I just saw it at dawn, when I got around the vineyard. - You must have dreamt it, uncle! - I did not dream it! I even saw its nest. In the reeds. I even talked to it. This summer? But tits migrate in winter time. Wire your head, pal, so that your huge wisdom not to bust it! - Don't deceive the boy with such tales! - It's not a tale, Marton. Because the king of tits is not the same as the poor ones. Because this one goes about wherever it wants. Apparently, it can, because the king of tits has enormous power. It only turns its crown twice and can go anywhere it wants. I think it's already in the pumpkin. Just go and have a look at it! If you are actually the king, then you are more giant than the griffins. We cut their heads off... but you don't have a crown! So you must be the prince! We will see whether you go about whenever you want or not. You are the prince, indeed. It's diphtheria, my darling, just like with the other kid. I have warned you to take care of him! Wet clothes, compress... It takes, mother, it takes... - He will break it! - Give it back to me! Give it back! Would you grudge it from the ill, my son?... He will break it! Don't let it! He will break it! Calm down, sweetie! I bring the villain, he took it! Here it is! The king of tits says to me that I should give it to Ferko, he is a good boy... They're gone. - Who is gone, darling? Noone was here. Yes, they were... Kusmodi and the king of tits. And we didn't notice it at all. - I'm hungry. - Oh, finally, I can hear you saying that! Soldiers and herdsmen, come here fast! Bring a crown to my godson! And a flossy mantle onto his shoulders, and a scone with goose-fat into his hand! What is he going to wear at school when he recovers? I have also been thinking about it. I will make something out of my grandfather's fur. The one on the attic? But that one is so full of holes that it won't be enough. It will be enough. Oh, look at that, what a hardworking apprentice! - Show me, what are you sewing! - A jacket. - It's time for him to go to school. - To school? I won't be a student. - Well, what do you want to be, son? - Treasure seeker. Just like the son of the cobbler in Bagdad. - Where did you get that idea? - My mother has read it from the calendar. His name was Aladdin, he had a lamp, and if he rubbed it, a ghost... jumped out, saying: What do you need my dear master? You can ask anything, I'll give you everything. Well, I would give a chipped mug for a lamp like this. But you should go to school anyway. Why? My mother has already taught me writing. Don't let him in, father, he is a quack. Don't be afraid, he is a fool, he must be looking for the cellar here. I hear the little boy is ill. Why didn't you call me earlier? - I can help him, immediately. - Thank you, Uncle Kusmodi, but, thank God, he is alright by now. Open your mouth, let me see if you have diphtheria or not. Bunny fat, crane fat will eliminate the pain, Crassula, dog-ear will make you feel okay. By the morning toll of the bell, Ferko will be fit as a fiddle. Everybody wakes up who I pow-wow, even a dead one. Anyway, do you know what I came for? I will make you rich, furrier. There is treasure in your cellar. You don't know it yet. We could bring it out if you helped me. But it is too high for me to reach. Coal is far from here and is full of waste. But we could do it from here, your cellar. Well, your ancestors must have been maul-throwers, Uncle Kusmodi. What is your problem with my ancestors, they all were miners. They mined coal from hills with their ten nails. You have been living in that mine for about thirty years. It's empty, Put up with it! It's bloody empty. Even the poor's house would be better for you than the one you live in now. The poor's house for me?! Do you have any idea who I am? I could turn you into a lord, you have never seen in your dreams. You could measure the silver by bushel, and the gold by shovel, Even your dog could eat doughnuts. I don't have a dog, uncle Kusmodi. Hey, don't mock me, furrier! Without me, you don't know that you come from a noble family. Of course, I know: my father was a miller too. God rest his soul, he didn't need ladder to harvest the melon. I'm talking about your grandfather, about who you don't know anything. I do know, he was a shepherd. His filch is on the attic. I'm talking about his grandfather. You don't know who he was, do you? No, I don't. Your forefather was the baron of the country. His treasure is hidden inside that hill. There is an enormous amount of gold, diamond and gem. I have been there. Look! I had a magic wand, but a mean troll stole it and I can't find it. The road is here, through your cellar. I know you'll help me out, because no one else does. Nobody, nobody! Okay, uncle Kusmodi, your head is in fog again. You will regret it! You roasted pumpkin-eater, jacket-destroyer! I have a magic cauldron. If I boil matutinal dew with some sensitive plant in it, every brick turns into gold. I just intended to help your misery. I'm not an indigent! But you did not believe me. You could have been a rich man! You did not believe me! Blast you! Here it is! It also took the roasted pumpkin, which is not completely ready. I make up a bed for you inside. Father! Yes, son? Was it real treasure what that amn showed us? Probably. - I will be a treasure seeker. - Oh, that's a nice profession. - Where would you look for treasure? - Inside the hill. Didn't the man say? 'In the cave'. How will you find the treasure without a magic wand? I will rub the magic lamp. And where would you find a lamp like that? In our lamp, there are no ghosts at all, not even a small one. Hm? But hold on, I will help you. - What was Aladdin's nationality? - Turkish. Then, the ghost of the treasure was also Turkish, that's why it lived in a lamp. The Hungarian ghost doesn't live in a lamp. - No? - No, no, it lives in a jacket. And not in a casual jacket, but in a magic one. Father, could you prepare a jacket like that? Well... I could. Please, prepare one for me! It's not so easy, my boy. Nobody in the world is allowed to know about this jacket! Not even your mother! If anybody gets to know that this jacket is a treasure seeker one... the little fairy escapes at once. Do you understand? Yes, I do. Can you promise not to tell this secret to anyone? Of course. Well, if you promise it, I will prepare the jacket for you. I promise. - Godfather! - Huh? Is it true that old Kusmodi can send the rats off the house by whistling? Yes, it's true. And could a fairy cope with Kusmodi? - It depends on the nationality. - Well, a Hungarian one. Where does it bed? In a mine, a house or a magic flute depending on what it prefers. Which one were you thinking of? I was thinking of fog, fog... - Fog-fairy! - That one might be good! Aunt Mari, have you ever seen a fairy? Yes, I've seen one in the cradle. No, I meant a fairy from the tales. - Oh, I also know that kind. - And can we see it at all? Yes, it appears as a swan or as other bird. How does it turn into a fairy? It somersets seven times and that's it. Seven times... One, two... three, four... seven. Nothing happened. Damn it! Ferko, check on my ducks! Is the fox chasing them? In a minute! Go! Run after him! Catch him! Come on, run after him! Let's run after him! Come on, faster! He's here! Come back! Quickly, quickly! After him! Let's run, quickly! Quickly! AI see you'll be a cavalryman as ? soldier? A cavalryman? It is easier to run away from the enemy on a horse. Instead of kidding me, father, please tell me... when will you sew the fairy into my jacket? What are you talking about? I don't want to stab the fairy. Hm? Oh, it will never be ready. Of course, it will. It only needs buttons. I just wanted to cut the proper ones. It will be ready by morning if you promise me you behave... and you will guard it as the apple of your eye. I promise. How beautiful it is! Good morning, Ferko! - Father, are you sure the fairy is in it? - Absolutely! Where does it live exactly? Everywhere in the jacket. - Does it help me find treasure? - It helps good children. That's why it's treasure seeker. Put it on! Let me see! Spin around, please! Why is there this little house on the back? With this tiny house, you can stay at your home wherever you are in the world. You will grow into it! - Thank you! - You're welcome. Wear it in good health! Godfather... Godfather! Help me now if you are in it! Mitvisz! Please hurry, godfather! Bark, my little dog! Godfather! Godfather! What are you looking for down there, Ferko? Maybe the day before yesterday? Come on, hang on to it! - Oh, thank God! - Did you become a lord or what? Very nice jacket! I see you've become a jacket owner! I came to my godfather! You must have been in hurry if you didn't notice this pit. What is so urgent? I'm seeking treasure now. Treasure? With what? Do you have a magic wand? - Me? I don't have. - That's a problem. It's a big trouble, because the mine keeper guards the treasure. And if he gets angry, he will mess up everything. He especially hates miners, because they steal all his treasure. We always redeem him with some bread. He likes it quite much. But a little boy, like you, shouldn't go alone to these dangerous places, where he doesn't have anybody to protect him. But I have. I will, I hope. - Godfather, have you ever seen a fairy? - Of course, I have! Once I've seen it closely. And what was it like? It's such a strange creature that when you actually see it, it's not really a fairy but a mist over the water, a firefly in the grass... a zither-sound in the oak trees. Come on, oo-oops! - What's the matter, Ferk?? - The fairy is not real. Don't think the fairy is so stupid that it comes out of your pretty and new jacket. Aladdin rubbed only a shabby lamp as well. Oh, boy! You will ruin it. What would you do with a half-eyed, maimed-eared, weak fairy? - I won't be a treasure seeker! - You will! You are going to attend school soon, learn a lot very well, and you won't even notice it became worn out. Then, it will come out once and give all its treasure to you. Wait for me! Wait for me! Puli! My little dog! Puli, Puli, Puli! What's going on here? Everybody, to your place! Sit down! Where is Ferko Szucs? - Here. - Great. Go to your place! Mister, this boy in the jacket always walks under the desks, just like a puli. Clean your face, Ferko, it's dirty. Puli, my Puli! Cintula! First grades, get your boards ready! Write a line of the letter 'o'! Puli! Puli in the jacket! Third, fourth and fifth grades, please open your readers! Ferko Szucs! Stand up! Could you say a few words beginning with 's'? Puli! Sssz! Cintula! Sit down! Don't be afraid of the questions! Cintula, you bastard! Werewolf! Catch him! Go and catch him! Puli, puli, puli! Are you fighting, little boy? Do you want something? Get out of here! What do you want? You want a beating? I will punch your face! You want beating? You have no guts! Cowardly Puli! Ferko! Ferko! Where are you going, my little apprentice? I'm running away, uncle Gyurka. What? Did you want to leave me without even saying goodbye... to your godfather? Come here! At first, let's sit down for a while. Let's sit down at my house, and then I will let you go. Tell me, do you have problems at school? - Yes. - I've heard about that. This week I talked to your teacher. I asked him what you will be when you grow up, milk or cottage cheese? And he answered that neither milk nor cottage cheese, but curd. - How do you like that? - Cintula always mocks me. - I don't live at all. - Oh! - He once beat me. But I don't dare to hit him back, because he is so strong... that he can do the handstand with one arm. Oh, little boy! That's it? Why didn't you tell me earlier? I have the solution for this, I will bring it here in a minute. Mitvisz! What do you think about it, little boy? It's a rather ugly thing. It was very pretty forty years ago. It was a nice black velvet one. Until the grease infested it. It had a silk ribbon until the mouse chewed it, This was a brand new hat, when I became a shepherd. I wouldn't put it on my head for God's sake. Why? You will put it on like it or not, because it's a wonder hat. Who wears this hat will be a hundred times stronger both physically and spiritually than before. You will be able to do the handstand on your head! You know, I've become such a strong man, because I've grown up in this hat. Put it on! Show me, show me! Wow! I can't believe it! You look like a prince in it! What a pity that there are no mirrors on the walls of my house. So, wear it in good health! Don't forget to wear it tomorrow when you go to school! I won't, thank you! - Look, how nice puli is in the hat! - Oh, so pretty! - This is beautiful! - Hey! - You talked to me? Yes. - Get out! - Wow, get out? - Do you want something? - Yes, I do! You bastard, take that! Damn you! Nobody ever dared to do this! You can get more if you need! Wow! Cintula's reign is over! Ferko beat the famous leader! Sit down! Third grade, open your readers! Second grade, open your notebooks! Fourth and fifth grade, calculate the function on the blackboard! First grade, take your boards out! So, Ferk? Szucs! Could you say words beginning with letter 'b'? I could! Brave, bicycle, board, beat, begin... black, bucket, buckle. Ok, boy. What's your godfather's name? - He is Gyurka Messzi, isn't he? - Yes, he is. I met him yesterday. He is a hearty man. If you meet each other, please tell that I greet him. I will. So, was the famous hat successful? Thank you, godfather, I'm not a puli anymore. Last time you left your globe-trotter bundle here. - You don't need it anymore? - No. Then, you don't need the hat anymore. Give it to me! Don't make a fool of yourself! You don't think a fairy lives in this old hat, right? So, how is it then? There is no fairy in it? No. - It's not a magic hat? - Of course not. Oh, wow! Don't be so sad! If you are brave, you are brave without a hat. What do you want to do with the child? It's summer. He has to do something! Jackets are not so popular now. As far as I know, the chamber is empty, how will you feed that boy? The best place for him is next to me. - We won! - It was enough! - That was good! Take this jalopy home! - Do you still live on credits or not? - Yes, we do. - God grant you! - God grant you! So? - Cheers for the forty-eight, godfather. Hello-hello! Say something, please! Your godmother sent me and advised to take you too for the summer break so that you could put on some weight. But your mother doesn't allow you to come. Your godmother has already baked doughnuts for you. - Tell me, would you want to come? - I would. He is smart! So can I take him? If he also wants, we allow him. We can go then. But I insist on him spending the Sundays at home. Alright. I want him to be my son at least on Sundays. Then prepare all the things that this little furrier needs! - Shall I give him some food? - No, his godmother will feed him well. You see, pal, I don't have neither little nor big. But on the Bordacs' land there is a plenty to bite on as well. If I take him with myself, you can bet... I'll him into be a man like myself after a while. So, here comes the little furrier. We can go. God grant you! Why do you need this for the summer? To wrap up. Am I right, boy? God grant you! Once more, God grant you both, my dear goody and pal! God grant you! I send a warm hug to your godmother. Alright! Come! - What's the matter? - Nothing. Ferko, it's not your business, come! Finally you are here! The delicious lunch is ready. We have to hurry, apple picking is waiting for us. Don't let the rain do it instead of us! Here it is! Did you get hungry during the travelling, my dear? You have such a beautiful jacket, but not in the orchard. - Are you hungry? - Yes, godmother. Ferko, please go to the chamber! You will find a basket there, please bring it here! Nice! Don't pamper him! Go and pack something! Ok, bring it! - Can you climb the tree? - Like a squirrel! - That's good! - And do you like apple? - Just like an oriole! We have a lots of apple, but overeating makes people lazy. - Here it is, if you are in such a hurry. - Yes, we are, right Ferko? A child doesn't have to think about eating all the time! That's it! Hey, silly pal! You are not right! I bet with Fules, which one of you is the faster. I want to see that you are spry and you deserve the forage more. Come on, Spry! Spread your wings and fly, Oriole! We arrived. You aren't runny enough to be a donkey, let us see are you good enough to be an oriole? Here is the basket, go to the top of the tree! Pick the pretty ones! And don't drop any apple! Hey, the apples go into the basket. One, two, climb up the tree! Come on! Whistle, oriole! You don't even know how to whistle? What kind of apprentice will you be? If not, then not. Instead tell me something! You know something beautiful? - I know. - Then tell it to me! Once upon a time, behind the beyond, there was a very strong warrior. His name was Siegfried Csontos. Siegfried? But why was he Csontos, was he so bony? - I don't know. - Go on then! I'm all ears! This very strong warrior had a magic cloak. Anybody who wore that cloak became stronger than 12 people altogether. The warrior wearing the cloak went to fight Bumhilda. Who was this Bumhilda? A beautiful and quite strong girl, who was good with guns. Anyone wishing to marry her, had to overcome three tests. - Do you know what those three tests were? - No, I don't. The rest was missing from the calendar my mother brought down from the attic. - Do you know the ending? - Why wouldn't I know? Can you sing? - I can. - Let me hear it! "The fairy's little boots are ruined, and his jacket is crying. He is soaked to skin and almost freezing. If I had a pair of boots, I'd give them to the fairy. I would cover him with a jacket, which is hairy." Ok, stop! It's not so good eating apple in sunshine, because our teeth will fall out. We can sell these in the market. Instead, eat from what your godmother gave to you. If some apple fall down while we go, you can pick them up, but always put them back into the basket! It can start raining now! Gee, Spry! Make it snappy! Help me, darling, the boy is too tired, he has exhausted himself in the apple garden. Are you tired, my boy? I'm about to warm up the dinner. He isn't hungry, make up his bed, godmother! Come here little boy! Ferko! Come, Ferko! Come here! Alright. Hushaby, little lad, hushaby! - This cradle is your bed. - This? Look, what's in the jacket! This is what the doughnut has become. That's life! He must have been very tired, because he fall asleep without dinner. We have make a good bargain with him. He will be an adroit, clever lad, I believe. They don't have much money and his father prepared him a jacket like this. He loves Ferko. He is a boy... Twirl, embroidery, oh my god! Marton wastes his money. If you were a furrier, you wouldn't do it differently. He sewed such a flashy jacket, it's not suitable for the little boy. He is an only child, no wonder they want to spoil him. It could be sold for a good price in the market. Darling, stop it, the petroleum is running out. Mother, I would like to be an apprentice instead. That doesn't suit you, my dear. You can't shout like an apprentice. - Not even whistle with two fingers! - He can't even whistle with four fingers! - But I can! - Let's hear it! (he is blowing air) I told you. I will be an apprentice anyway, a smith-apprentice! - Smith? - That doesn't suit you. You should be stronger to be an apprentice. I'm strong enough! Would you help me? You should go to smith Nekopogi. - He likes quiet children. - We can give it a try. Is it him? He is too weak. - He is a strong lad, master! - He won't have a long wind! No? His ears are small, there is no grip on him, not suitable for being a smith. Neighbor Csorboka is looking for an apprentice. No need for strength, wits are enough. Would you give him a try after all, master? Well, thank you very much! Shall we try the bookseller's shop? Janos, where are you? I will be there in a minute, I'm just searching for my sheet music. I got it. - Good afternoon! - What can I help you? He wants to be an apprentice and we heard that you actually need one. Apprentice? Yes, I need it, indeed. But he is too young. - Would you like to be an apprentice? - Yes, I would. You are quiet, little boy! Can you read out loud? I can! - Do you like sweets? - If somebody offers me. He is an adroit child. Come here and read it! I'm a little boatman lad, my boat is on the water, I sit in with my sister, to take her far away. And this? Janos Borovicska's soldier in boots is Janos Hary. - Csontos Siegfried. - Janos, come on! I'm coming, I just need the sheet music. Do you know money? - I know. - How much is this? - 10 mites. - And this? - 20 mites. Good! What do you like more, gingerbread or reading? - Reading. - Alright. Here you can do that. Madam, this child is born to be a bookseller! He will get into the gingerbread eating soon. I employ him. For a porklet. I'm afraid, we don't have any porklets, mister. You don't? Never mind, it's alright. I hire him on probation, but he stays here now. - I also hace to go. - God grant you! Behave, Ferko! Listen to me! First row 10 mites, second row 20 mites, third row 50 mites. We don't sell anything more expensive than that. And the books, master? First row 10 mites, second row 20 mites, third row 50. Who looks for a more expensive book, that person is too smart. We don't server noble judges, you understand? Yes. I have to go now. Watch everything, I'll leave the door open. If anyone is looking for me, I will be behind the balcony upstairs. You only have to shout and I will be here, you understand? Don't accept some shiny buttons instead of money! - Me? I'm not crazy. - Pointful, pointful. I'm coming! I will keep my eyes on you from upstairs. Be adroit! I'm coming! I NEED SOMEBODY Thank you, little fairy! - Let's start! From the tutti. - Yes. - Good afternoon! - What would you like? - Do you have the Csontos Siegfried? - Here? - No. - But it was here yesterday. That was yesterday. Choose something else for yourself! - I buy this. - Ok, I don't want to see you! Let's start with the letter 'a'! - What do you need? - Csontos Siegfried. Don't stare at me, go away! - Csontos Siegfried! - Go to the hell! Excuse me for a second! Is this the place where I can get gingerbread for free? Yes, if you ask for Csontos Siegfried. - What's that? - Don't care about that! Give me a little bit! I won't, go inside and take it for yourself! - Did you pay for this? - No. What's going on here?! Get out! Get out! Get out, you bastard! Who do you think I am? I don't want to see you again! Don't come here ever again! What am I?! I haven't gone out of my mind, I'm not a fool! Evil child, so you want to be a merchant apprentice! You didn't get much as an apprentice. - Csontos Siegfried! - Csontos Siegfried! (children together): Csontos Siegfried! Bee, Bee! Get out of here! Get out of here! Once more! In front of me there's north, behind my back south, the Sun sets on my left and rises on my right. Cintula, are you ready with the test? Almost done, mister. Cintula, did you begin the task at all? Yes, I did begin, mister. I see that you worked on something. Let me hear it then, read what you have written! Write five linking words! The first, colon... the first... The first... colon... I just wanted to write down the first. Let me hear it! Which will be the first linking word? Er... sack string. - What do you want, little boy? - I would like to attend school. You are a little late, child. I came to the town four weeks ago. Here are my school reports, I've already finished the first grade. Why doesn't your father accompany you? I don't have neither a mother, nor a father. They have passed away in another town. My grandfather began to take after me, he is a local citizen. - What's your grandfather's name? - Kelemen Kusmodi. Wow, the fool! Quiet, please! - And what's your name? - Matyi Three. Matyi Three, how shall I provide a place for you, when there is hardly enough space for only one Matyi. - He can't sit here! - Nor here! You know what, boy? Take a seat next to the stove. At this time, that's the best place. It's good, very good. You've just come when you have to go. Leave everything here! In the afternoon, we will finish what we began. You can go home. Mister, please! Mister, please! Let me stay here! I live over the town. Even a healthy legged person wouldn't be able to go back and forth by afternoon, and I'm limping. You can stay if you want, but you should also eat something. - I have food. - Sloe! - It isn't good, mister. - It's good only when you have a lot. Delicious? Made with sour cream. - Thank you for the lunch! - Where are you rushing? What is so urgent? I've brought it for you. Eat it! I like it. Do you also often bake bread at home? Here we don't do it often, but I used to bake with my mother. My father liked the end of the bread. - What was your father? - He was a miner, but he died long ago. When the mine exploded. My grandparents came to save him, but he wasn't alive. - Was Kusmodi a miner? - Yes, a tamper. We still live in the old mine. - Hey, Matyi! Sweet roll. - Thank you. Do you live in the old mine? Yes, we do. - Are you often alone in the mine? - Yes. Aren't you afraid of the mine keeper? No. He leaves you alone if you give him some bread. - What is your father? - Furrier, he made this too. Nice jacket. I will be a mining engineer. There was one in our mine. He lived in a big warm house and he always had something to eat. Matyi! Here you are! - Is it mine? Is all mine? - Yes, sure. - Can I take it home? - Of course. Thank you. I didn't bring anything, there was only soup in our house. But you know what? I do a handstand for your honour. - We are friends now, aren't we? - Yes. You come to us to play, and I go to you. Then you show me Kusmodi's cave. I can't. Grandpa is waiting for me on the hill. You know, he is mad at every child who can run faster than me, who doesn't limp. Don't come further now! God grant you! - Grandpa! - I'm here, darling! Finally, the fairy! What shall I ask from you? First, I ask you to find me a treasure nobody else has in the world. Do it by the noon bell! Sit down! Thank you, my little fairy. Ferko, what do you want? - What's this? - This is a telescope, boy. Who can do the Christmas math test without mistakes will get it. - It will be mine then. - Mine! - It can be mine as well. - What can we see in it, mister? - The stars, boy. - Can anybody see them? - Those who look into can. When there are stars are on the sky. Nice machine, huh? - Which one of you will get it? - Me. - It will be mine! - Hey, little boy! - Sorry for being late! - Are you ill, boy? - No. Go to your place! I began to think that one of my best students won't participate in this competition. Notebook on the desk, task on the blackboard, solve it! - Are you ill? - No. Collect the notebooks! Ferko, take them to my office! You can pack. He is coming! Let me announce the result of the test. Sit down! The winner in the calculus test is Ferko Szucs. The others made mistakes here and there. Even Matyi Three. Although it's a small mistake, but it's a mistake. You wouldn't have thought it Ferko, would you? No. Take the telescope, it's yours. You deserve it. You worked honestly. Packs on the desks! You can go home! Ferko! You can pack it and take it to home. It's yours. Nice equipment. - Are you ill, darling? - No. - Don't you want to eat something? - No, I don't. - But you didn't even have dinner today! - I don't want to, thank you. I want to sleep. there was such a beautiful yellow copper ring on the end of it. And it can be pulled so that you could almost see the Moon. It's so cold, grandpa. I wish it wasn't everything so dump. Look, as if my coat also soaked. Calm down, sweetheart, I'll make a warm place for you. We have run out of dry faggot and we hardly have any candles left. - I know. - We will be in darkness soon. I'm scared. Calm down, darling. I wrap you up, it will be good. You could have given a little bacon with the bread, mine keeper! Look Matyi, the mine keeper does exist! Look what he gave to us! - Real bread! - Yes, indeed! Who eats it will be as strong as a rock. Taste it! I'll break it for you. It's so good! Won't you eat it, grandpa? How many days passed since you last ate? Four days. I? The mine keeper didn't want to let me go until I ate my half loaf. I'm totally full. I put my hands under your jacket, because they are cold. Put them, I'll feed you. If I become a mining engineer, I will have a room with two stoves. I will sleep in one snug and you will in the other. - My hands are very cold. - Give them to me! I warm them up. Tell me grandpa, why people are laughing at you? Even children run away from you. But you are the best person in the world. They think I am a fool, because I seek treasure. But they are the fools, because here is the treasure. I found it. Grandpa, light another, it's about to blow out! We don't have more candles, darling. Do you know what Christmas angels wear? - What? - In a warm jacket like Ferko Szucs's. I wish it was nor?t so dark! Oh, I almost forgot that I have some more wax! Over there, in the old mine, where I was looking for the treasure. This place will be so bright that Christmas angels... will gather here! Grandpa! Come quickly, look at this! The mine thrush! Come fast, climb up my back! Up my back! There's a shorter way! In that direction! - We have brought him. - Poor old, wanderer soul! - He passed away with the mine. - He never found the treasure. He did find it. We found a great deal of coal wher he died. - We can open a new mine here soon. - He passed away. - God rest his soul! - Mitvisz! What does this dog want? Mitvisz, go and show it! Give it to me! Give it to me! People, people! Here! Here is my godson! Come here! Go boy! Run and warn the Szucs parents! To the blow-hole, quickly! He will be alright. He will be in bed for a week, but there won't be any problems. - Oh, please don't! - God grant you! - Thank you, doctor! - Can I go in? - I think he is sleeping. Eat, my sweetheart! The mine keeper caused so much trouble for you. Please tell me, when will my grandpa come? The mine keeper kept him there as a guest, feeds him with hen and scones. You'll stay here with us, okay? Father... The fairy moved out from the jacket, didn't it? Yes. Father, I sewed such a great jacket in my dream... that every shivering child in the world could find shelter under it. You had a beautiful dream, son. The End Translated by Nikolett Szabo
