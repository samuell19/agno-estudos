My generation, we were born into war. Giant monsters attacked our world. We called them Kaiju. They came through the Breach. A gateway to another dimension, at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. They were sent by an alien race on the other side, the Precursors. We fought back, building our own monsters. Jaegers, giant robots. So big they needed two pilots to run them. My father was one of them. He sacrificed himself to help save the world. I am not my father. It's been 10 years since we won the war, and closed the Breach. Most of the world's recovered. But a few coastal cities never did. And the world is still picking up the pieces. But some of us live better in a broken world. And squatting in half a mansion, is better than paying for some crappy apartment. Now, in the relief zones, you have to get creative. You have to hustle, or somebody else might, eat your breakfast. And your cookies. And your damn hot sauce. You know out here, we place a different value on things. The Pan Pacific Defense Corps usually looks the other way, as long as you don't go poking around where you don't belong. Say like a... decommissioned Jaeger scrapyard. Big risks mean big reward. And nothing pays more than stolen Jaeger tech. Plenty of nutcases out here trying to slap together their own Jaegers. But they need the parts to do it. So if you can steal what no one else can steal, you can live like a king. Are you sure it's in here? Power cores are stripped before they get decommissioned. But sometimes they miss the tertiary plasma capacitors. And that's a big score. This one's still holding a charge. You better hope so. Ok. Let's just calm down. Let's not get excited. I'm just playing the odds here. You cheated Barada in Juarez, skipped out on Chau in Hong Kong. Now that was a misunderstanding. And stole from me in my own backyard. Now I'm stealing for you. Circle of life. We good? You deliver, and yeah... we're good. Ok. Let's get rich. Let's. Target lock. Where is it? Target lock. Hey man... just a little situation. It says it's here, it's supposed to be right there, but you know what, let me just figure this out. Target lock. Somebody please kill this guy for me. Target moving. No, no, no. It's here. You, wait, wait! Someone else is in here. Someone else has the capacitor. Now, let's go. Come on. Jake! Jake! Hey, wait! You son of a... Go! Go, go! Split up. Go! Hey! Come on, Jake! Hey boss, he went over here! Go, go, go, go! I see him. I see him. Jake, Jake, Jake. Nice try. Yeah. Jake! We're good. Jake! Jake, you son of a... Target lock. Target lock. Target lock. Hey! Get back here with that! Target moving. How old are you? Old enough to kick your ass. Let's take a second. Back up. Back up. You build this thing yourself? What do you think? I think I can sell your little toy for a whole lot of money. Scrapper's not a toy, and she's not for sale. The man holding the pipe says she is. So listen up. You led them here? That's impossible. Hey! Ah, what the hell, man. Come on, come on, come on! Yes! It works! Ok. Hey! Get out. What are you doing? No, no, no, no, no. Where is it? Stop! Hey! Don't touch that. Hey! What are you doing? Stop! Where's the other one? The other what? The other cradle. A Jaeger needs two pilots. Scrapper is small enough to run on a single neural lobe. All right, then you get out, and you let me pilot. Get out! Screw that. Told you she's not a toy. You're gonna get us killed. I can get us out of here. I just got us out. Oh, my God. That's November Ajax. Pilots of unregistered Jaeger, this is the Pan Pacific Defense Corps. Power down and exit your Conn-Pod. No, no, no. Don't, don't, don't. Don't give up. You give up way too easy. That's what they think. Stop. You're in violation of Code 10 Section 14. Operation of an unregistered Jaeger. Hang on. I am hanging on! Hang tighter. Seriously? Stop. See? I just out-piloted November Ajax. No, you didn't. Did. Didn't. Ok. What do you got? And I'm not getting out. One of those ion cells redundant? No! They are now. But we need them. Get up to Ajax's head. What? Go! Power down. Low power warning-Twelve percent. I told you we needed that! It worked, didn't it? Eleven percent. How long before Ajax can reboot his systems? About that long. Power down. This is your final warning. All right, let's go. Look what you did to my Jaeger, you jerk! Should have let me pilot. Oh, like this is my fault? You compromised my command center. Your command center? Yes. My command center. Wait. Sorry, I didn't hear that. Your command center? Yes! Oh sorry, excuse me. And you had no place to come in I go wherever I want. And try to tell me what to do. I go wherever I want. It's a different world. Ok, 'cause it really worked out well, right? Look where we're at. You know what? Your top lip and your bottom lip, they need to meet and become friends. Smart. That's a good one. They need to close up, all right? Shut up. Shut up. Conversation done. Yeah, I can. Good. Junkyard baby. Why did you build it? What happened to the shutting up? You said you wasn't gonna sell it, so what the hell was you gonna do? Rob a bank or something? I built her because one day, they're gonna come back. The Kaiju. And when they do, I'm not gonna be stuck waiting for someone else to come save my ass. Not like before. You. Let's go. Hello, Jake. Here we are again. Look, it's just a stretch of bad luck. I'll figure it out. Father used to say, we make our own luck. Yeah well, Dad said a lot of things. You were arrested in a rogue Jaeger. Hold on a second. That wasn't my Jaeger. There's this little kid. She's about this tall... You have priors. This is serious. Ok. That's why I need my big sis, to help me get the hell out of here. Just one last time. They are not going to let you just walk. But there might be another way. Ok. See, that's what I wanna hear. That's what I'm here to talk about, the other way. Lay it on me. What do I gotta do? Re-enlist and finish what you started. I'm not doing that. I'm too old to be a cadet. I don't want you to be a cadet. I want you to help train them. Train who? Train what? I'm not training no damn kids. The transport is standing by to bring both of you to Moyulan. Both of us? You and your new recruit. Mako? I can't believe she just hologrammed me. Yeah, look. I didn't have a choice. I know, I get it. But why me? Why do they want me for the program? You built and piloted your own Jaeger. These people like that kind of stuff. Ok, so then why am I just a cadet, and you get to be a ranger? Valor Omega. Oh my God. That... That is Valor Omega! Scrapper! Hey! You gotta be kidding me. I didn't believe it when they told me you were inbound. How you doing, Nate? It's Ranger Lambert. Are you having a laugh? This is a military base. You remember how that works, Ranger Pentecost. And you must be Amara Namani. Yes, sir. Ranger, sir. Well, let's get you squared away. Oh and... try not to steal anything while you're here. Did that haircut just call you Pentecost? As in badass Stacker Pentecost? Pilot of Coyote Tango, hero of... basically the whole world? It's just a name. Yeah. A really cool name. SIM training starts at 0600. You're late, you miss the day. You fall behind, you'll be on the next transport back to wherever they found you. That's Titan Redeemer. And Bracer Phoenix! She's a three-man rig! Saber Athena! I love Saber Athena! She's the fastest Jaeger in the fleet. Did you know that? Warning. Stand clear of lift. Ok, so which one's yours? Gipsy. You pilot Gipsy Avenger? He used to. Until his co-pilot got a better offer in the private sector. Jules Reyes. J-Tech. Amara. Cadet. Jake. Ranger, apparently. Heard a lot about you, Pentecost. Yeah? You know you still hold the record? What record? Shut up. So how'd they lure you back? I mean, it couldn't have been the pay, so... Yeah, it's a long story. But if you want to talk about it, we can meet up... She's busy. Ranger. Eyes front, Pentecost. Come on Renata, not the face! Sorry man. Raise you two shower chits. Fold Ilya. You need all the showers you can get man. I have a musk! What you smell is musk. Ranger on deck! Audio system deactivated. Cadets, this is Amara Namani. She'll be joining you in SIM training bright and early. And this is Ranger Pentecost. He will be helping me instruct you until I can find a new co-pilot to replace Ranger Burke. Anything you'd like to add? Nothing you wanna hear. Malikova, get Namani squared away and prepped for training. Yes sir! As you were. Pentecost. We're gonna be trained by a Pentecost! So? Not like he was the one who died helping close the Breach. He's never even been in combat. Renata, let's go for round two. Yo, Ilya, you see this? Hey. So, where should I... Heard you built your own little Jaeger. Yeah. Actually. Scrapper. I operated her too with this solo bay... You want to put junk together, be a mechanic. Moyulan is for pilots. Hey, come on. I got ya. Thanks. Yeah. Jinhai. Ou-yang Jinhai. So you and Vik already buddies? Vik? It's short for Viktoria. But you don't want to call her that. Yeah. What's her problem? Took her three shots to pass the entrance test. Yeah. Don't think she likes how you landed here. It's not my fault. Recruiters never come around back home. Hey, know any Russian? No. I'll teach you some. Calms her down. Come on. Let's get you squared away. Hemispheres out of alignment. Warning. We need to reconnect! I know! I'm trying! MAGLEV deactivated. I just can't get this. That sucked. Drift simulation terminated. You know, when I heard you gave November Ajax a run for his money. I thought we might have something here. Now, I'm not so sure. How am I supposed to drift in this thing? It smells like feet. I didn't ask for your excuses, Cadet. You putting her up against Kaiju that almost killed veteran pilots, doesn't make any sense. Maybe she's not the only one that doesn't belong here. See Nate, I know you have a problem with me. Come on. She's just a kid. So were we. That's the point. You make stronger connections when you're young. And that kind of bond makes for a better drift pilot. Yeah. I remember the pitch. Thanks. Ryoichi, Renata, you're up. Show our new recruit how it's done. What the hell are you wearing? Jules loves it. Yeah, she told me it's nice to finally have someone with style around here. Can't blame the girl. I'm sexy. Yeah. Want a drink? Sure. Thanks. Ice cream's up top. Yes. Yes. So one more time around? To prove your old man wrong? Nah, I just came back to see if your chin implant ever settled in. I think it's settled in quite nicely. Yeah. It's very commanding. Kids must love it. Jake these kids, they look up to us. We gotta show them that we can work together. Well, the war ended 10 years ago, man. You just need to let that go. Just... You have to understand your enemy's... You have... Sorry, mate. You have to understand your enemy's objective to know you've defeated them. We still don't. No. I can help you out with that. See I'm thinking, it has something to do with them sending giant monsters to kick the crap out of us. No, no, no. The Precursors wouldn't send Kaiju to flatten a few cities if they were trying to wipe us all out. All right, look, Nate, I don't have a problem with you, man. But I had to make a choice. It was between your pretty face and prison. I chose your pretty face. Oh, well, I'm touched. How many damn toppings do you need? Leave my toppings be, man. Don't mess with my damn toppings. So the cadets got like what? A couple of months before they graduate? Six. Ok. I tell you what. Every time you want to say something soldiery to them, I'll just nod. Or like yep, what he said. Then before you know it, they get to be pilots. I get to get back to my life. Great. Boom. It may happen sooner than you think. How so? Big dog and pony show tomorrow. Shao and her team are presenting this new drone program they have. Could make us all obsolete. Sounds like my get-out-of-jail-free card. You know, you can front all you want, but you and I both know you could've been great. Sorry. She doesn't do the whole hand shaking thing. Dr. Newton Geiszler. Head of research and development for Shao Industries. That's a nice firm, grip you got there. That's a much better look on you. Guess it's better than prison stripes. Barely. I'm sorry, is this him? It's gotta be him, right? You're Stacker's kid. Hey, I'm Newt. I was a big fan of your father's. Amazing speech writer, by the way. Did you ever hear his one where he canceled the apocalypse? Newton! Hermann. I was hoping you'd be tagging along. I could use your help on an experiment I'm working on. Now, this will only take a moment. I know how busy you are. Yeah. Don't want to impose, but... Ah, come on, you can't impose on me. I mean. We've been inside each other's heads, right? We've saved the world! Look, we've drifted with a Kaiju! You know, if we hadn't yanked that intel out of that Kaiju's brain, Raleigh would've never been able to close the Breach. Now that was you! And that was me! Technically more me, but any chance we could make this quick or... Deployment. Of Jaegers. Deploying them into battle, it takes too much time. The amount of damage a Kaiju can inflict before they've... Ah, here. I think I've found a solution. Hermann, you know I can never read your... Rocket thrusters. Yeah. No. No. There's no fuel in the world with that kind of boost-to-mass ratio. From this world. No. Is that Kaiju blood? Exactly! I've discovered Kaiju blood is highly reactive, when it's combined with rare earth elements. Cerium, lanthanum, gadolinium. I realize that, pal. Ok. You can't be fooling around with this stuff. You're gonna blow yourself up. Now, no one knows more about Kaiju morphology than you! If you could just take a look, please. No Hermann I gotta stop you. Look, none of this matters. Once my boss's drones are approved, deployment time, that's gonna be a non-issue. Within a year buddy, we're gonna have drones... everywhere. So you won't help me? Why don't we talk about it over dinner at my place? Ok. You can finally meet Alice. I don't need a hot meal, Newton. What I need is a solution to a very specific problem. That's me, bud. I'm sorry. Duty calls. It's been nice catching up. Newton. I... I still get nightmares... about what we saw... when we drifted with that disgusting Kaiju brain. Yeah. But... it was a hell of a rush, wasn't it? Oh... I know, I'm terrible. Yes, we shared a lab together. Some crazy idea he had about thruster pods on a Jaeger. Well... The man's completely harmless. Ok. Could you say that again and this time about 80% slower? I said, don't make me question your loyalty. Understand? What's the question? I barely talk to the guy anyway. My drones are the next step in Jaeger evolution. The system I designed, processes commands, through a quantum data core. This means that a single pilot can operate the drone remotely, from anywhere in the world. As soon as the council approves deployment, based on Secretary General Mori's final report, the days of struggling to find and train drift compatible pilots, will be a thing of the past. And you think a bunch of desk jockeys are better than us? We are not here to shut you down. Cooperation between our programs has never been more vital. If there are any questions. Yeah, I got a question right over here. We are pilots. Not a bunch of office workers! And now we're shouting. There's no need to shout. That was slick. So how long until all this is shut down so I can go home? I don't trust the tech. Not yet at least. It looks pretty good to me. Remote systems can be hacked or compromised. No, you've got the key vote, right? So there you go. It's your decision. I wish I could just go ahead and approve them. Nearly half the council is backing Liwen. They aren't going to like my decision. Who cares what they like, and what they don't like? I tell you what, I'm gonna go with you. For moral support. Plus I wanna get out of this place. I'm glad you offered because I already requested Gipsy Avenger as honor guard at the Council Summit. You know Gipsy's Nate's ride. His co-pilot works for Liwen now. He needs a new one. One that you already know is drift compatible. All right. I'll do it. I got your back. But I wanna be there when you tell Nate because I just wanna see his face. He's gonna be so pissed. He's just gonna stand there like, Yeah, I don't think you belong in a Jaeger, Jake. Get out of my Jaeger. I'm handsome and sexy. He is handsome. He is sexy. Thank you, Jake. Welcome back. Lots of sunshine today, to kick off our weekend. Good afternoon everyone. Peter Overton broadcasting from the Nine Studios in Sydney... So far, police say at least 49 officers injured. Kaiju worshipers in black masks throwing bottles and rocks. PPDC Security in riot gear are attempting to... Gipsy Avenger, this is Marshal Quan. All you have to do is stand there and look pretty. Stay focused, try not to fall over. Roger that, sir. Go for drop. In three, two, one. Drop! Jake! Drift alignment unstable. Relax. It's coming back to me. You sure? Ion cells activated. We're in each other's heads, remember? So I'd appreciate it if you'd stop thinking about Jules. Not gonna happen. How about you stop thinking about kicking my ass? Not gonna happen either. Gonna be a long day. Incoming transport. Your ETA to zero is two minutes. Warning. Gipsy to Command. You reading this? Gipsy, this is Command. Be advised. We have a rogue Jaeger. Pilots of unregistered Jaeger, power down and exit your Conn-Pod immediately. I repeat. Power down, and exit your Conn-Pods now. Missiles fired! Low power warning. We're losing power! Jake! That Jaeger's power reading is... It's jamming our comms! Nate! Power's up! Oh, shit. What do we do? Follow my lead! Mako's hit! She's going down! We've gotta move! Activating gravity sling! Mayday! Mayday! Mayday! This is Mike, Mike, Charlie, 0-5-2. We have been hit, and we are going down! Sending. Mako! Jake! Wait! Drift alignment failing. Come on, Sarah! Do something! Drift alignment failing. You stupid brain thing! Hey. Hey. So, I'm not really good at... emotional stuff, but... I really am sorry about your sister. Half-sister? Yeah, her family died during the Onibaba attack. My dad took her in. She was my sister. My family. Why are you out of uniform? Just had a lot on my mind after Sydney. I guess I just wanted to be comfortable. Well, don't let Ranger Lambert see you in that. He might take the stick out of his butt and beat you with it. I think I'm safe. It's wedged in there pretty tight. So they're still using Sarah. Yeah. And I can't drift with her for some reason. All the other cadets have been training for years, and I just... I hate feeling like the slow kid. You gotta relax. Or you're just grinding gears. I'll help you out. Got it, Coach. Don't call me Coach. All right, Sensei. Concentrate. We have to make a good connection. You can't do that if you're yappin' your gums. You ready? Ready. All right. Let's see if we're drift compatible. Come on Amara, get him! Neural load exceeding limit. Stay focused Amara. Remember, the stronger your connection, the better you fight. That's it. Amara! Come on, jump! Jump to me, baby! You have to, Amara, come on! Jump! Amara! Don't hang on to the memory. Just let it flow right through you. Amara! Amara! Jump in there! Yeah, come on. Get together. Ready? One, two... Cheese! Got it. Wanna see? Wait a sec. Amara. Amara, you need to let it go. Amara! Look, just listen to my voice! Amara! Amara! Daddy! Daddy! Amara! Come on, jump! Amara! We need to break the drift! Jump to me! Come on! I'm scared! Baby, I will catch you! I promise. Come on! Amara! Amara, come on! Jump! Amara! Take it off! Hey. Are you okay? I was there. I felt it. Yeah. I felt it too. Jake, it's me. Are you there? Yeah, I'm here. Meet me in the lab right away. Marshal wants to see us. All right. On my way. You ok? What is it? A message. From Mako. She was trying to send it from her copter right before it went down. It's a data package. High density. Obsidian Fury was jamming comms. How could her signal get through? It didn't. At least not intact. So it's gone? Gone is relative in the digital realm by... By running a modified fractal algorithm, I might be able to reconstruct a few megabytes. There. Is that a Kaiju? I'm checking against PPDC Kaiju archives. No match against the database. Keep looking. Whatever this is, it was important to her. I want to know why. And I want to know who was piloting that rogue Jaeger. Hey. Sorry I'm late. I thought you were still in Sydney. That's great. Thought you'd be a little more enthusiastic, doc. Yeah, no, I'm pumped. This is great. It's just the timing of everything with the attack and all, feels a little... I was there. I know what happened. Neural connection terminated. Yeah. I guess they do. If you look at it sideways, and you squint, then maybe you could say that... I'm sorry, what is going on here? Forty-eight is a... Get it done. Ok. Yeah. Not a problem. That'll be fine. You don't think there's a way? All right, well then you're fired. Ok? How about that? Or maybe you're promoted. I don't know. We'll see how it goes. Just get it done! Give me this. Hey honey. I'm home. Sorry I'm late. God, things were... Things were crazy today with what happened in Sydney. All those people, it was not pretty. My boss almost got killed. That could've been bad. Maybe. I guess, I don't know. That would've been great actually, that one is all over me. I mean... I can't get a break from her! I'm ranting. Enough about work. And enough about her, really, I should be focused on you. How about we have a little fun in the bedroom? How was your day? Oh, that's great. Yeah, that's exciting. What's that? A little pick-me-up? Well... what can I say? You read my mind. They're calling it Obsidian Fury. There's never been a rogue like this. News feed said they were posting a dozen Jaegers at the memorial. When I die, I want that many to send me off. Your pop's gonna make you work with boobs when you wash out. Jaegers do not show up when the boob guy dies. Wait, your dad works with boobs? He's a plastic surgeon. He doesn't just work with... I'm not gonna wash out. I'm gonna be a pilot. Still. You die, Well, I post one Jaeger at your funeral. Maybe half a Jaeger. I heard that's where they found Amara. In half a Jaeger. It was a whole Jaeger. It just wasn't very big... Viktoria. Bigger is better. What did you say? Am I saying that right? Yep. I worked every day of my life to be here. You didn't do anything. You were just picked up off the street, like garbage! Guys, come on! Hey! Hey! You know where I learned that? On the streets, you big dumb... Ranger on deck! She jumped me! She doesn't belong here! I don't care! You know, when I first joined the Corps, I was just like you. Worse. I was nobody. But that woman we laid to rest today, Mako Mori, she said whoever you are, the minute you enter this program you join a family. And no matter what they do, no matter how stupid they may act sometimes, you forgive them, and you move on. So you start believing that. In here. And you'll start believing it in a Jaeger. Hey Marshal's looking for you guys. Says Gottlieb found something. It isn't something. It's somewhere. Severnaya Zemlya. Off Siberia's Taymyr Peninsula. What's in Zemlya? Well, nothing anymore. A facility roughly in this location was used to manufacture Jaeger power cores earlier in the war, but it was decommissioned years ago. Why would Mako be trying to tell us about an abandoned factory in the middle of nowhere? Sir, permission to take Gipsy Avenger to see what the hell's out there. Scanning. Looks like Mako's message was a dead end. This place is abandoned. No, wait a second. I'm getting some weird readings. Incoming! Take out his legs! We gotta get out of here! Plasma cannon! I think we pissed him off. Good. You remember our old move? Hell yeah. He looks hurt! Go for his power core! Warning. Warning. Pilots of Obsidian Fury, get the hell out of your Conn-Pod. What the hell is that? It's definitely Kaiju. A secondary brain used to control the hindquarters. How'd they get into our world? There hasn't been a breach in 10 years. Sensors would've picked it up. I don't think there was a breach. Kaiju flesh, has a distinct radioactive half-life signature. Particular to the Anteverse. This specimen does not. Wai, so, you're-you're saying that it's from our universe? The genetic fingerprints indicate distinctly terrestrial modification techniques, probably engineered from Kaiju flesh left over from the war. Precursors didn't do this. Humans did. Oh, my God. That hunk of slimy crap was piloting Obsidian Fury? We got to get a look inside. Inside? That thing's part Kaiju. Come on, guys. When are we ever gonna get a chance to see something like this again? Never. Never would be good. You guys can stay here. I'm going. No, Amar... Amara. Guys, guys, we should not be in here. It's fused all the way through the system. Like... Muscle tissue. That's how it was able to move like it did. Cool. Yeah, cool. Working with boobs is sounding better and better. Shine your light over here. Yeah, let's just go yank on the guts of the weird-ass Kaiju killbot. What is it? I think it's some sort of... Jinhai! I told you not to yank on those. Go get help! Go! Man, we are so screwed! This goes way past what she did. The decision has been made. Security will take it from here. We're done. Is Jinhai okay? He's got some scarring, but yeah he'll live. Marshal put him on probation. Meilin and Suresh, too. They blink wrong, all of them are out. No, it's not their fault. I talked them into it. I'm sorry, I tried to talk to the Marshal, but you're dismissed from the program. Never belonged here anyway. Really? You know, I used to say the same thing a long time ago. But... I actually didn't wanna be here. Still don't. Why'd you sign up? We were at war. And my dad was leading the charge, and I thought... maybe I could see more of him. Maybe even drift with him. Well one night, me and Nate got into it. It was over something stupid. I can't even remember what. So, I climbed in an old Mark IV, just to show him I didn't need him to be a great pilot. That's pretty dumb. Yeah. How far did you get? About seven steps. Take or leave. How far did you get? About two steps, and I blacked out from the strain. And the first thing I saw when I woke up was my dad, just standing right in front of me looking stern. What did he say? He said I was out of the program. He said I didn't deserve to be in a Jaeger. Look, he said a lot of things. A year later, my dad was gone. And I didn't get a chance to prove him wrong. More importantly, I didn't get a chance to prove it to myself. You listen to me. Don't let what other people think of you define who you are. You won't like where that takes you. Do you understand? And keep your head up. And you might just be as good-looking as me in this type of situation. Seriously. This face is set up well. Beauty is a burden. You'll be all right. Shao Industries. What? Obsidian Fury has tech in it made by Shao Industries. That's impossible. Jules and her team scanned every centimeter of that Jaeger. Insulating metamaterials wound counter-clockwise in the shunt cabling. Shao's the only company that winds them that way. Amara, are you sure about what you're telling me right now? Yes. Yeah. I stole a ton to make Scrapper. I thought it might be important. Yeah. Thank you. Shao Industries? They don't even have a bio-division. Yeah, not that we know of. Cabling could have been stolen, just like in Amara's Jaeger. We're gonna need more than that to connect Fury to Shao. What about Newt? He'd have access to the internal records, the shipping manifests. All right, go see him. Keep a low profile. I have a mission? Finally! We'll take what we know to the Marshal. This isn't fair. I'm sorry. You don't deserve this. It was my fault. This is on me. Amara. The next Jaeger you build, make it a big one. System online. And we have delivery at 100%, people. A 100%! That's the way that it's done, ok? I told you we could do it, and we did it! Malfunction. I'm losing uplink to drone 375! Why? Why? Figure out why! We'll take what we know to the council in person. Prep a transport. Give me a second. Get to Gipsy! Go! All pilots, man your Jaegers and engage hostiles! Ok, you got this. You cool? Yeah, super coll Just stay calm. I know! I know! I know! I'm heading right... Hermann? What are you doing here? How'd you get in here? I do have PPDC credentials. And besides everyone else seems a little bit preoccupied with the killer drones your boss just set off! She used you. No. She lured you with money, No! And a fancy title. No way. While you were basking in the glow, she took your research and she twisted it. Help me stop her, Newton. Help me save the world like old times. All right, technically, you were helping me last time. Let's get that straight. Fine. Help me help you save the world. What do you say? I say... I say, don't shoot! God damn it, why can't I get this language? What's happening? Are those Jaegers? No, they're drones from Shao Industries. What are they doing? I don't know! They just went crazy! Hey! Clear the deck now! Get back to your quarters, right now! Yes, sir! Go, go, go! Go! Get the hell out of here! Come on! Go, go! Come on. Come on, come on. Get up. Really? Now? Hermann! Little help! Next time, why don't you learn how to use a gun? Take that! Vile, vile individual! Thank you, Newton. Yeah. I'd hug you if I didn't have a rule about public displays of affection. It's fine. To hell with it. Ok! All right. If you're done groping me? Let's take care of the drones, right? All right, good. Everyone, get out of the lab or I will shoot you! I will shoot you twice! You're officially fired! Get out! What do we do? How do we stop this? There's a back door, Hermann. To what? To the drone subroutine. I added a subroutine just in case I wanna get in here and poke around down the road. Oh, sneaky bastard. I know, right? What did you just do? What I've been planning the last 10 years. I'm ending the world. All pilots, breaches detected. Drones in the field are opening multiple breaches across the Pacific Rim! Why? Why would you do this? Why would I do this... Well... I guess I wouldn't. Not normally, not really my style. Yeah, no, I don't know, maybe I hate you all for treating me like an insignificant little joke of a man. Maybe that's why he did it, Hermann. I did it. See... There you go. There's the problem. I'm just not feeling totally myself these days. You. Precursors. Very good, Hermann, you figured it out. And as usual, a step behind. Newton. You are a good man. No. Hermann. You must stop. No, there's no point in fighting them. You must fight back. I'm not strong enough, Hermann. Please. You must! I am not strong enough. He is not strong enough! None of you are strong enough! I'm sorry, Hermann. They're in my head. Oh, hey, boss. The hell are you doing here? I told you to get to quarters! All the doors are blocked! What do we do? I mean, 38% of your company is fully automated. It really wasn't very hard to reallocate a little over here, and a little over there. And slip in a little Kaiju surprise without you noticing. Stop! Wait, wait, wait. Newt's not in control of himself! It isn't him! It's the Precursors. They must've infected his mind when we drifted with the Kaiju. Shut up! Stay here! We're gonna try and get to Gipsy. You ready for this? No! You? No. On three. Great. One, two... Hello? Anyone there? Gottlieb? Jake! Thank God! We're under attack. You need to force Liwen to shut down the drones! It isn't her. It isn't Liwen. It was Newt. The Precursors, they've infected him. They're controlling his mind. Gottlieb, can you get him to disable the drones? No. He got away. Gottlieb, shut them down. It's trying to lock you out. Feedback loop. Gottlieb, what the hell is going on? Gottlieb! Gottlieb, shut them down or we're gonna die! Shut them down! Yes! Liwen has disabled the drones. The breaches are closed. I repeat the breaches are closed. Oh, no. Oh, no what? Three Kaiju have gotten through. South Korea, Russian coast, and East China Sea. Two Cat-Fours and a Cat-Five. Copy that. Get back to the dome. We're gonna need all the help we can get. You girls okay? Yes, ma'am. All right, what do we got? The reports are still coming in, but drones took out Jaegers and Shatterdomes across the Rim. All right. How many Jaegers do we have here? Operational? Gipsy Avenger, barely. That's it? Yeah. Ok. We need more Jaegers up and running or this is gonna be a short fight. Even if we can, all of our other pilots are either dead or severely injured. One disaster at a time. Let's just focus on those Jaegers. Smallie, come over here. I need you to help Jules with the repairs. Can you do that? I thought I was kicked out. I'm kicking you back in. She's pretty good at turning junk into Jaegers. You good with that? Hell yeah. All right. We got a lot of work to do, and not a lot of time. We got incoming! I brought some help! Hakuja, Shrikethorn, and the big fella, Raijin. I took the liberty of assigning the designations. Well, the spiky guy and the big idiot are moving away from the cities and towards the ocean. What does that mean? Maybe they're trying to link up with Hakuja in the East China Sea. Yeah, I bet Newt would know what they're up to... if we can get it out of him. Yeah, we'd have to find him first. Any Jaegers closer to those Kaiju than us? What was left of the Chin-do and Sakhalinsk domes tried to intercept. Emphasis on tried. I'm afraid we're on our own. There's gotta be something here. Something in the East China Sea. Maybe that's not where they're headed. Pull up a map of Kaiju movement from the war. Pushing data to main display. What, do you know something we don't? You said we need to understand our enemy's objective to know we've beaten them. What if the Kaiju weren't blindly attacking our cities during the war? What if we were just in their way? Right here. Mount Fuji, Japan. Extrapolate for Hakuja, Shrikethorn and Raijin. Mount Fuji? But why? Rare earth elements. Mount Fuji is a volcano rich in rare earth elements. Kaiju blood reacts extremely violently with rare earth elements is the basis of my fuel-thruster experiments. Excuse me. That sounds bad. That's bad, right? Very. Mount Fuji's active. A geological pressure point. Based on the blood to mass ratio of the Kaiju, the reaction would cause a cascade event, igniting the Ring of Fire around the Pacific Rim. Billions of tons of toxic gas, and ash will spew into the atmosphere, wiping out all life. And finish terraforming the Earth, for the Precursors. We can't let them reach Mount Fuji. I'm gonna check with Jules for Jaeger repairs. Even if we had a hundred Jaegers, there's no way to intercept in time. What about your thruster pods? Oh, no, no, no. They're not ready. Can they be? Well in theory, maybe with your help. Gottlieb, what does that mean, in theory? Today, it means, yes. Saber Athena, Guardian Bravo and Bracer Phoenix are good to go. It's not a lot to work with. Liwen can patch some Fury tech into Gipsy that might help. Hey... Prep everything we got for deployment. Ok. Don't get yourself killed. You either. Well, that's confusing. Let's just stay focused. We got four Jaegers against two Category-Fours and a Fiver. It's better than just Gipsy. We still need pilots. We have them. Oh, shit. If my dad was here, he'd probably give you a big speech. Make you feel invincible. I'm not my father. I'm not a hero like he was. Like Raleigh Becket, and Mako Mori. But they didn't start out that way. They started out as cadets, just like you. We remember them as giants because they stood tall. Because they stood together. It doesn't matter who your parents are, where you came from, who believed in you and who didn't. We are a family now. And we are Earth's last defense. This is our time, this is our chance to make a difference. Now let's mount up and get it done! Do you understand? Yes, sir! Jaeger pilots, do you understand? Yes, sir! Do you understand? Yes, sir! Now help me save the world. Let's do this. System online. Initiating neural handshake. Establishing neural link. Amara, jump in there! Neural handshake strong and steady. So, how does it feel to be in a real Jaeger? Bigger's not bad. All right, all Jaegers sound off. Go-no-go for launch. Guardian Bravo, go. Saber Athena, go. Bracer Phoenix, let's go already. Copy that. Command, we are go for launch. Roger, Gipsy Avenger. Ignition in 10 seconds. Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Ignition! Warning. Exceeding structural limits. What the hell? My grandmother used to play it for me. Keeps me calm. What about me? Not calm, man, not calm. I knew it would work. Gipsy to Command. Targets acquired. Roger that, Gipsy. Everyone in the city is secured in underground shelters. You are clear to engage. Solid copy. Going hot. Bracer Phoenix, on me. We'll take Raijin. Roger that, Gipsy. Saber Athena, Guardian Bravo, you take the other two. Copy that. It's our turn to save the world. Let's hope so. On my mark. Three, two, one. Mark! Fire! Gipsy, Raijin's face plates are absorbing the hits and throwing the energy back at you! Let's see it absorb this! How many buildings can this thing take? Shrikethorn inbound! Hey, guys, we could use a little help over here! Right now! Copy that, Saber. Vik, take out Shrikethorn! On it. Saber Athena, Guardian Bravo coming to assist! Activating arc whip! Yeah, that's right! You better run! These things ain't that tough. Bracer Phoenix, watch your six! Hostile inbound! Copy that! Yeah! Ok, we're going with giant robots again. All right, real original, guys. I'm not impressed. I am not impressed. We've got movement! Multiple hostiles, three kilometers southeast. Liwen! Are you reading this? That's one of my automated factories. It was Newt. He's in Tokyo. Locating his position. Hostiles, one klick away and closing fast! All Jaegers, brace for contact. Disengage and brace for contact! Ok. All right. Let's go, all right, go, go, go! Go, baby, go, baby! Where they going? Well, he's pretty big. All Jaegers, advance and fire everything you've got on my command! Go! Guardian, stand down! We've got this! Negative! That's an order! Freaking teenagers! Go for the eyes! Which ones? All of them. Ilya, Suresh, report. Do you copy? Come on, guys, sound off! Guardian Bravo, give me a sitrep. You guys okay? Guardian's down. I'm pinned in the Conn-Pod. Suresh? Suresh didn't make it, sir. Copy, Guardian. You just stay put, and we'll send you help as soon as we can. Bracer Phoenix, report. You guys Ok? We're a little banged up but... we're still in the fight. Us, too, Saber. I mean, Saber Athena, sir! Saber, Bracer, prepare to intercept at the following coordinates. Let's finish this. Move your ass. And don't be late. Copy. Bracer Phoenix hauling ass! Gipsy to Command, do you have a tactical scan of the hostile? Assessing data from their sensors. We have it Gipsy, but it's still compiling. No time. Can you locate the brains? Hostile's central brain mass is heavily armored. Your weapons won't be able to penetrate. What about a secondary brain? This son of a bitch have one of those? Hostile has three secondary brains. One for each component Kaiju. Sending intel. Package confirmed for Saber Athena. Confirmed for Bracer Phoenix. All right team, follow my lead and stay alert! Fire up some of that Fury tech Liwen grabbed us. Read my mind, partner. Damage detected. Eject! Eject! All pilots eject! Amara! Warning. Neural load exceeding limit. Nate! Nate! Warning. Nate, stay with me! Stay with me! Get up! Nate! Pilot down! Get up from that, you pile of junk! Bye! Liwen! Is there anything you can do to help? I need more time! We don't have any! If the hostile reaches Mount Fuji... Understood. Not gonna let that happen. Jake, you can't operate Gipsy without a co-pilot! The strain will tear your mind apart! What do we do now? Regroup with the others. Amara! Gipsy Avenger, this is Amara Namani. Stand by for assist. Amara, don't. You won't make it. I'm gonna! Don't! Don't! I told you. Since when do I listen? Amara, you're up. What are you doing? Getting the hell out of your way. You got this, brother. Ejection sequence initiated. Ejection sequence successful. You ready for this, smallie? One way to find out. Ok. Stand by, Command. Initiating neural handshake. Establishing neural link. Come on. Yeah, that was supposed to be epic, but it wasn't. Definitely not. Warning-Cascade failure-Multiple systems offline. Reboot. Ok, I'm on it. Command to Gipsy. Hostile is two kilometers from the summit of Mount Fuji and closing fast! Gottlieb, do you have enough fuel left in your thrusters to launch us into the atmosphere? The atmosphere? Yeah. Possibly, but there won't be enough to slow your reentry. We don't need to slow down. We're gonna drop Gipsy right on top of that thing. I just ejected my escape pod. Yeah. We'll have to use mine. Jake, there's only one thruster with enough fuel remaining. Sending location. All right, checking. We're too far away. We're not gonna make it. Gipsy Avenger, transport inbound. Remote systems are online. Sending help! Scrapper! I've located the thruster pod! Stand by! Come on, come on! Move them little legs! The thruster's way too strong, there's no way we can hold on to it! Liwen, what do you got? I can weld it to your hand. I upgraded Scrapper's weapons. Nice. I was actually gonna do that. No, you wasn't. Yes, I was. We only got one shot at this. Yeah! Then let's make it count. I'm stuck! Stay there! You're an extra ton we can drop on that thing! She's coming apart! Almost there! We're drifting off course! Use the plasma cannon! Disengaging safety protocol! Plasma cannon engaged. Warning. Exceeding structural limits. It's working! Structural failure. Hold on! Come on! Come on! Target locked! Jake, Amara, you need to eject! Disconnect! Amara, disconnect! I will catch you! I promise! Come on! I've got you. Gipsy to Command, we're getting the hell out of here! Escape pod failure. No. No, no, no! I'm sorry, smallie. For what? We got to save the world. Your dad would be proud. Scrapper! Hurry! Get over here! Hurry up! Move! We have to go! Twenty kilometers to impact. Get out of there! Go! Go! We're in! Close the door! Hang on! I am hanging on! Hang tighter! No! No! Ok, you know what? Plan B. Always a Plan B. Anyone who's listening, this is Ranger Lambert. Be advised, we just caught ourselves a Newt. Copy that. There he is. I'm glad you're still okay, man. You too, brother. I knew you could do it. Well, I had a lot of help. Nice work, Ranger Namani. Thank you, sir. Never seen snow before. So out of all the things to notice right now, you're noticing snow? Big, dead Kaiju is right there. Ok, okay, all right. And I'm not sure if you're... Is this the part where you're gonna give me one of those big, dumb speeches? Did everyone think it was dumb, or is that just your opinion... Just be honest. How many times did you practice that in front of the mirror? It was motivational. Ok. You can be whoever you wanna be. Ok. Now you wanna play that? Fire! I'm a natural at this. No, you're not a natural because... Oh! Give me a break. I've never done this before! God... There you go. Boom! We did it! You think this is over. You think you've saved your crappy little world? We're gonna keep coming! We are never going to stop and sooner or later. Your luck is going to run out! Nah. The things in your head? The Precursors? Tell them we're not afraid. Tell them next time, they won't need to worry about coming for us. Because we're gonna come for them.
