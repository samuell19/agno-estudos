I'm Special Investigative Agent Kessel... ...in charge of the FBI and Department of Justice's Joint Task Force... ...on deranged and violent criminals. In the most extreme, brutal and violent cases... ...traditional forensic investigation can be inadequate. In these instances... ...to hunt down these most vicious and elusive killers and psychopaths... ...we solicit the assistance of civilians with extraordinary gifts. Catherine Deane was one of them. Now there's another. Commander Skylar, reporting to 217. I repeat, 2-1-7. Do you copy? Roger. Now here we go, surrounding... Turning around. It should be above you. It looks like some kind of abandoned mill. It has a stone wall around it. Ramparts. Please, what is our heading? Where is this place? This is Commander Skylar. We are looking for an abandoned mill. Something with rock, stone, a thick structure. Heading is confirmed, over. - Airship is already in the area. - Go, go, go. I need a confirmation on this. - Keep heading on towards 217... - I see it. It should be on the down, 95 out of the red... The paralysis is wearing off. Roger. We're heading towards the deck. We're coming up on the deck... I want all teams ready to go the second we arrive. All teams ready to go on arrival. Roger that. Airship 1. We're awaiting... Where are they? Please. Help me. Please, please. I beg of you. Her last memory is of being in the box. She can't see anything. Neither can I. Wait. - His bracelet. - No. I could go into his conscious mind. I could see what he's seeing right now. - No. - Yes. Where is she? - You know what's going on down there. - I'll be safe. Give me something, or we're going in. You sure about this, Maya? Yeah. Okay. We hold for Maya. All right. Heart or the mind? The eternal question. The human body can endure a lot. Eliminate the heart or the brain... ...not too much left. Is that you, Maya? Go! He knows we're here. Skylar, go. Go, go, go. Tell me what you see. Tell me you got this bastard. Pack it up. We're out of here. Now he's gone, and she's dead. That's good work, agent. Damn it, Maya. Why can't you describe this guy? Because I can't. I can't. All right. It's all right. - It's not your fault. - No, of course it isn't. The next girl he kills won't be your fault either. Don't worry, Maya girl. We'll meet again. Thanks. Victoria Austin. Local girl. The same marks as the body last month, right? Yeah. And it's just a hunch... ...but I'm guessing the same cause of death too. I haven't been doing this very long, but I've never seen anything like this. God. Same marks, same age, same body type. Fellows... Looks like we got a serial killer. Serial killer? She'll be my first one. Had a lot of those out in L. A. Worked out good for their coroner. He wrote a few books, didn't he? Hey, maybe I could do... Hey, doc. - Give me a break, will you? - Guess this makes this federal? Sheriff. A girl's gone missing over at the university. Sheriff... ...it's your niece. Penelope. So how does this work? I need an object that has a link to his mind. The more he handled it, the better. And then you'll be able to see my Billy? See into his mind? I can't see into his conscious mind, but I can look through his memories. And, hopefully, that'll lead us to him. I... I can't thank you enough. Did you bring an object with you today? Yes. Here's my boy. Billy. Maya. It's been a while. What do you want, Kessel? I need your help. I don't work for the FBI anymore. - Much more important work going on here. - Skylar. Why now? - This could be anyone. - It's the Cusp. He's back. - I can't. - Come on, Maya. We got closer to him a year ago than we've ever been. - Because of you. - No. Because of me... ...Sarah Miller's dead. I've spent the last three years of my life chasing this guy. It's over. That's it. And now he's back. Put it behind me. Looks like you've done a great job putting him behind you. He's taken a new victim. Yeah. It was about 24 hours ago. So you know exactly... ...what he's doing to her... ...right now. Anybody. Please, help me! Please! Please, I'll do anything. I'll... Please, I promise I won't say anything. I won't tell anybody where you are. I won't te... I'm going to make you beg for death. But first... ...I'm gonna kill you. Oh, God. Please. Maybe for the last time. I'll help you get as many women as you want if you let me free. No, no. Please, please. Don't do this. I wanna live. Just kill me. I wanna die. Hmm. Tell my family I love them. Tell her family. Why would she want me around her family? That wasn't very well thought out. Don't do it. Don't do it. I'm begging you. Don't do this. All the girls have something to say. What are you do...? What are you...? Oh, God. Oh, God. I don't know. I don't get it. No place to hide, no other cars to hide behind. I got nothing. What about you? We've been over this spot with a fine-toothed comb. The boyfriend said she parked her car here, but there's nothing. Maybe the boyfriend lied? Maybe he did. I don't know. We just got a call. A conductor with the Utah and Western Railroad... ...says he saw an '87 Acura Legend, navy blue... ...pulled over by the locomotive shop the night Penelope disappeared. All right. Come on, let's go. Find anything? Yeah. Tire marks are consistent with a 1987 navy-blue Acura Legend. - Maybe she stopped to pick up a hitchhiker. - I doubt it. Take a look around, see what you can find. - Yeah. - Did you hear that? He can tell the color of a vehicle just from a simple tire track. Guess you're not the only one that can read minds. The conductor saw the car parked here the night she was abducted. - You must be FBI. - That's right. Well, looks like she was able to drive away. Yeah, so? So no flat tires, no oil leaks. - No car trouble, right? - Again, so what? What's an 18-year-old doing parking here in the middle of night? She got pulled over? - And who pulls people over? - Law enforcement. Oh. Exactly. We always knew the Cusp had medical experience... ...considering his success in bringing his victims back. Personally... ...I think it's a cop. You know, he knows our procedure too well. He knows what we look for. Hell, even... ...leaves things for us to find to throw us off. To me, that says law enforcement. That's a pretty good theory there, agent. Yeah, that's why I'm considering all local law enforcement suspects. Well, what do we have here? Boot print. About the same shape as yours. About the same size too. Ahem. But you haven't been down here yet, so... - Or you've been here before? - Heh-heh. That's some pretty amazing detective work there. Yeah, looks about a size 11 cowboy boot. Most likely made by Dicks. Probably only 100,000 of those in the state alone. Thanks to your observation... ...looks like we can narrow our suspect pool down to about half the state. Understand my reservation with local authorities poking through my crime scene? Your crime scene? This is my niece. Well, if it's the Cusp, then it's federal. Look, I don't wanna bust your balls, sheriff, but from here on out, get behind the tape. - Heh. Yeah, right. - No, I'm quite serious. You know, let me talk to you for a second. I don't wanna bust your balls either. Let me tell you how it's done here. All right, you may think we're a bunch of backward-ass cops... ...whose only talent is spitting chewing tobacco. I've been doing this job for 10 years. I like to keep it simple. That way, we don't get all twisted up... ...about who's in charge. Oh. I figured maybe you and I, we could work together on this... - ...don't you think? - Uhn! - Yeah. - Yeah? I'm glad we could see eye to eye. Sheriff Harris? Hi. So you read minds, huh? They teach you that stuff at the FBI Academy? No, they don't. I got that on my own. - They found something over here. - All right. I'm sorry, Maya. - This is Duncan, one of my deputies. - Hi. Come on, let's go check it out. Could be a piece of the victim's shirt. What's this here? - That's too short to be Penelope's hair. - I'll run it for some DNA. Yeah, why don't you do that? I think the Cusp finally slipped up. Hey. We might be able to get something oft of this. You guys got a psychic in the FBI now, huh? Now, she's not just a psychic. She's got a unique perspective on the Cusp. She was one of his first victims. He killed her six times. She's the only one who survived being taken by the Cusp. Really? So now what? She reads minds, she channels energy, what's the story? It seems like death causes the brain to emit certain endorphins... ...kind of like having a near-death experience. So dying and coming back six times flooded Maya's brain with these endorphins. And it awoke part of her mind that lies dormant in most people. That's great. Took an already traumatized woman... ...convinced her she's a psychic. Nice job. No, she came to us. Watch. She can be pretty convincing. This is neurotoxin. What it does is it causes all the muscles in the body... ...to seize at once. Oh, almost forgot. You better hope I die this time. Why is that? Because if I don't... ...I'm gonna kill you. Oh! Here. Let me take your pulse. It's okay. I used to be an EMT. What happened? Pulse seems fine. Heart rate's normal. I don't know. - Must have been a flashback. - I wish you hadn't taken these off, Maya. Why? - I mean, what are these things all about? - Electro IDs help keep her safe. In other words... ...if I die in his mind, I die in real life. - You don't really think she can read minds? - No. She might have died six times, and I'm sorry about that. But I don't think it gave her magic powers. How did you get away from the Cusp? I mean, if it's okay to ask. When he brought me back to life the sixth time... ...my pulse was so weak, he took me for dead. Dumped me in an alley. Still better than getting my heart cut out. Can't think of a lot of gals that could bounce back from that one. Hah. You know what, do me a favor. Why don't you wait outside, all right? Sorry. Sorry... Kessel. I don't understand. Why am I seeing myself? Doesn't make any sense. It would have to be that this is, you... Oh, my God. This is a piece of the clothing I had on when he had me. Maya, he's taunting you. You're way too close to this thing. He knew. He knew as soon as he resurfaced that I'd come for him. He knows I have to get into his mind. To get Penelope, he knows. - No. Remember what happened last time? - I have to. There's no time. Look, Maya, that's it. It's over. We're gonna wait for the DNA test on the hair. Lab called. We should have results soon. Fine. Hey, why don't you girls hang tight? Keep her company. I'll let you know what we find. So... ...what you drawing? Not much. When I go into a trance, I can see the crime... ...where it took place, bunch of other details. I can even see the Cusp... ...but I can't see his face. Great. Great. I'm not a fake, Harris. I'm not crazy. All right. Let's just say that you could go into people's minds. - Tell me how it works. - Let me see your ring. - Mm. - My ring? - Yeah. - Yeah? All right. Here you go. You crashed. A helicopter. Yeah. Afghanistan. The Cobra was shot down. That's classified information. I can save your niece, Harris. All right. How about this? Here goes. Today, we are going to be talking about... ...electricity. Please, no more. No more. Do you know the entire body functions on electrical charges? It's really amazing, if you think about it. If the heart shuts down, a single electrical charge can get it going again. Please. Please, I can't take anymore. But... ...if you administer that same charge to a heart that's beating... ...huh... ...stops it dead. Please. - This may hurt a little bit. - Please. Please don't. Don't do this. You know what? I'm not gonna do it. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I shouldn't do this, and I won't. So just calm down. Calm down. Okay? - Gotcha. - No! Taah. You all right? Did you see his face? Nothing. Is Harris still in there? - What's up? - It's his DNA in the hair. He's the Cusp. What? Give it up, Harris. - What the hell is this? - Just give me the gun. You sure you wanna do this? Gotta go to where Penelope pulled her car over. This is taking too long. I should go back into his memories. Hello? No, it's just odd, don't you think? That these tire tracks are here in the mud. He's got all this dry area... ...parks her car in the mud. You don't think she pulled oft? I think the Cusp wanted you to find that shirt and those hairs. So he left the tracks on purpose. Penelope was already unconscious. Yeah. Skylar was wrong. Penelope didn't pull her car over here. The Cusp did. What the hell? Hey. Come on, let's go. Come on. Young lady, you are going to talk to me. I don't mean "talk," but you're gonna give me DNA, something. Now, that's gonna lead us right to the Cusp. And then there's a book deal for me. Maybe even a feature film. Surely, a movie of the week. And after that... ...Oprah. - Doc, what the hell you doing? - Ooh! Oh, crap. Harris, half the force is looking for you. The FBI is telling everyone you're the Cusp. - And you believe that? - Hi. Hi. Hey, doc, I need to take a look at your second victim. - Glad she's still here. - Yeah. FBI's got me doing another rush autopsy. It's just like the first one. No DNA, no prints, no nothing. If you add her to the girls the Cusp took before he came into town... ...she's actually the 23rd victim. Look, Harris, I know we go way back, but I could get in a lot of trouble here. I only need a couple of minutes. - Harris, we gotta go. - Hold on a second. - This guy's a real sterilization freak, right? - Yeah. He doesn't get his syringes on the street. - He buys them. - And only pharmaceutical companies... ...sell to licensed medical facilities, like hospitals or clinics. So an individual buying syringes in large quantities is gonna stand out. Mm-hm. Places like that keep records of their buyers. - Doc, I need to ask you a favor. - Hey, listen. No, hang on. I want you to check all pharmaceutical companies... ...and find out who sold large amounts of syringes other than hospitals or clinics. - Okay, look... - Also check on who bought a blood pump. - Look, Harris... - Hey, just trust us on this, okay? - Man, that was fast. Come on. - I was trying to tell you... Let's go. Come on. Spare change? Anything? Nothing. Damn it. Let's go. Come on. I know a place they'll never find us. Let's go. - What is this place? - We call it a safe house. We can lay low here until they expand their search. Won't your deputies know about this? I don't tell my boys about everything. - We should probably get started, huh? - Hey, I don't want you doing that. - What else were we gonna do? - I don't know, but it's not safe. Kessel told me about how the Cusp got away last time. I'm sorry. I don't want you tipping him off. Oh, God. I lost control. I lost myself in his mind. Got emotional. And I gave up all my power. Maybe you should take the power back. Make the Cusp lose control. The Cusp doesn't lose control. Are you afraid of the dark? When people hear it, that I was in that box for days... ...that's the first thing they ask. I say, "No. I'm afraid of the light." The dark meant I was safe. When the light came, then he was back. And it was time to die again. I don't even remember what my life was like before all this. All my memories... ...they're dim. Not real. And they're all I had. - You know I was an artist? - Yeah? Yeah. Hmm. I haven't drawn a thing since he took me. I just sit there for hours... ...just trying to draw his face. And I can't. I can't. He stole my life. We'll get your life back. We'll get it back. Please! Help me! Help me. Copy, Unit 58. We... I need backup... Thought I told you not to do that. Other suspects possibly in the back seat of the car. Hello, Maya. Hmm? Approach with extreme caution. Possibly armed and dangerous. There's no eating in the squad car. Roger. Copy that and stand by for... So, what the hell happened anyway? - Nothing. It was nothing. - That was really stupid. I said nothing happened. Look. What if this psychopath becomes aware of your presence? I was in his memories. You're putting yourself in danger doing that. All right. So, anyway, what'd you see? You were right. He took her from the parking lot. All right. Then we gotta go there. Sorry it's been so long since I've been here. I've just been crazy. Heh. You are gonna have plenty of time this time around for last words. You would be amazed how long it takes to bleed someone to death. I always am. Amazed, I mean. But let me warn you... ...some of the girls... ...well, they don't come back from this one. I mean, I'm good, but I ain't God. Heh. At least not yet. That's a joke. Oh. So boring. All right, describe what was inside Penelope's car. Um... It was a normal college girl's car. A backpack... ...some papers, a folder, some notes... - ...a rose. - A rose? Yeah. Did she have it with her when she was walking across campus? No, it was already in the car. Good. Yeah. - Harris. - Yeah. - Look, I tracked down the syringes. - What'd you find? I couldn't find anyone who ordered a blood pump, but I did find three individuals... ...who ordered large quantities of syringes. I've got a Greg Richards, David Berkowitz and an Arnold Thompson. What was the name of the second one? David Berkowitz. That's the real name of the Son of Sam. What's the address? - 403 Fordham Street. - All right, thanks. Listen, I don't want you in his head again. I can't kill him if you're in there. I'm not gonna let this happen to another girl. We'll get Penelope. Harris... ...if you get the shot... ...I expect you to take it. I can't do that. I've been dead before. - I know you've been dead before. - Promise me. All right, fine. I promise I'll take the shot. I got you. Look at this. Yeah, smells like chloroform. This is probably what he used to knock her out. I can use it to go in his mind. No. I don't want you doing that. If he senses you're in there... - FBI. - Yes. Could you connect me with Agent Skylar, please? Where are you going? I'm going to get this analyzed, see what it can tell us. We know what it can tell us. - I gotta do something, right? - You can't go back there. They'll be waiting for you. Naughty girls. Both of you. I know the way he's gonna kill her. I can't let that happen. She's my niece. She's my family. You have to let me go back into his mind. It's been 40 hours. She's died six times. It's our last chance to save her. Can't leave now. I'm not gonna let her die. Not again. I promise. Did that hurt? What is pain, after all? Just messages that your little nerve endings... ...are sending up to your brain. - Uhn! - Like so. See? What I'm doing now is sending a current into your nervous system directly. Allowing me to cause the sensation of incredible pain... ...without any physical contact whatsoever. Isn't that amazing? Now, if I was to keep turning this knob, right? I would cause enough pain that your brain would order your body to shut down. Give up the ghost, if you will. I find that just... Uh... Like, what, like...? Watch. Huh? Huh? Hold that thought. I do want to get this on tape. Scream. Let it out. Let it go. Scream, come on. Come on. You're not gonna be the first. Come on. Come on. Okay. Fucking lights. Fuck! No! See what you did? Goddamn it. Okay. Oh, gosh. My apologies. I... I gotta go check on the power situation. Hey. You okay? Yeah. What'd you see? It's like an old factory with a large pool. I guess. Looks like it's been there for years. That's gotta be the old chemical plant on the outside of town. - By the railroad track. - Wait. One more thing. I don't know how important this is. You know how I'm afraid of the light? The Cusp is afraid of the dark. There we go. Oh, crap. Skylar. Go to the chemical plant. Wait for me there. I'll catch up with you. - What about you? - Don't worry about me. I'll be fine. Hands, Harris. - Where's Maya? - She went to find the Cusp. - According to the DNA, you're the Cusp. - Come on, those hairs were planted. Okay, but you gotta come with me. - Well, that's impressive. - Listen to me. Maya went inside his head. She knows he's at the old chemical factory. - That's where she's going now. - Turn around. Hands on your head. - Hands on your head. - Oh, come on. If you're wrong about me, she's over there by herself. She's gonna die. Penelope's gonna die, and that's gonna be on your head. Finch, come on. This is idiotic. You gotta trust me on this. You know I do. But it's federal now. They got everybody out on this. Finch, you gotta release me. This is ridiculous. No. No can do, sir. Even if I could, we don't have a squad car at the station. You'd have to run down to the firehouse and borrow an EMT truck or something. Could you please empty out your pockets for me? - What did you just say? - To empty out your pockets. No, before that. You'd have to borrow an EMT truck or something? I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. Kessel sent me over to check out the place. This is not the greatest place to be by yourself. Where could she be? These buildings look the same. Yeah, well, we will find her. Meanwhile, I want you to sit here, wait. Harris is on his way now. No, we have to find her. He knows I've been in his mind. Listen, just trust me. Sit in the car, stay warm, and Harris will be here soon. I'm gonna go in and have a look around, okay? But... Almost forgot. Harris asked me to give you this. You left it down at the station. Be right back. You think you know who the killer is? So you're ready to confess? That's funny, Skylar, but I'm not the Cusp. You're right about one thing, though. He is a cop. A cop with medical training. A former EMT. A cop who wears a medical bracelet for his penicillin allergy. A cop whose locker is right next to mine... ...and can easily grab a couple of stray hairs. And he happens to be with Maya right now, as we speak. Okay, you two get out of here. You take the chopper. I'll support you with ground units. What? No! Remember me? - What is this place? - This? This is just my little playground. My mind. This is my world. This is where I keep them. You know. All the ones you couldn't save. How about now, you remember me now? Oh! Oh! How? How? How? How what? How do I keep you from recognizing me? How did I set all this up? How'd I keep my girlish figure and beautiful good looks? The answer to all three questions is the same. Hours and hours of preparation. - Up, up, up. - Ow! Before we get in there, you know I'm just doing my job, right? Are we square? All right. You're staying here. I still don't trust you. Prick. Now it's time for the big reveal. Do you wanna know my secret? Knowing is half the battle. And since dying is the other half, I think we better stick with this part. It's all about control. Light, dark, the collective unconscious. Jung knew it. Freud thought he knew about it. I live it. I breathe it. I eat it. And now that you're here, I will become it. Now, ahem. After I dumped your body, which, I admit, I did a little bit prematurely... ...crazy shit started to happen. I started having thoughts... ...and memories that didn't belong to me. That weren't mine. I gotta tell you. Having you inside of here... ...was, to say the least, a bit disconcerting. Freaked me out. But, with a little study, a little work... ...neurology, para-psychology, para-neurology... ...didn't take me long to figure out how your little talent works. So the next time you tried to crawl up on in here... ...before the FBI gave you a little fancy protective thing... ...I was ready for you. Here, a synapse stops firing, and blood flow is diverted... - ...from a small part of the brain... - No, no. And no matter how hard you try... ...you simply cannot remember... ...what I look like. Penelope. I don't know about you, but I can't wait to get started. You set this up. You had to know I was gonna come back for you. - Why am I so special? - Now, that's a good question. Well... ...first off, you're the only one that I can have like this. Secondly... ...the only thing that's better... ...than torturing a woman's body... ...is tormenting a woman's mind. Miss? Miss, where are you? Isn't it a shame? Don't you wish you could? Don't you just wish like hell you could remember? Don't you wish you could maintain some semblance of control? You. You caused so many needless deaths. Don't you think that is a shame? Don't you think so? Don't you think so? They think so. Remember this? Your 5th birthday. So cute. Gone. Senior prom. What magical moments are these. Gone. - Oh, look. Artist at work. - No. Gone, daddy, gone. Are we having fun yet? No. Your memories are mine now. And I'm gonna keep going until all that's left... ...is your time with me. Until all you have... ...is me. Hey, remember this? This will be your only memory. - It's all I'm gonna let you have. - No! You can't do this. I already have. Your memories are mine. Your memories are mine now. Oh. It's okay. It's okay. Hang on, okay? Aah! Shhh. I don't care about your last words. Where's the Cusp? So you know exactly what he's doing to her. I know. Please don't. He'll kill me. But he'll kill me. I don't wanna die. Your mind is stronger than his. Make him lose control. You have the power. The power is in your mind. Get your power back. Make him lose control. He's afraid of the dark. He's afraid of the dark. Okay. Now it's time for that age-old question I'd like to pose to all my girls. Heart or mind? Goddamn it! Now you can't see my face. Where are you? What's happening? Come on, Duncan. Don't you remember? It's all about control. I'm in control now. Turn the lights on. I need the lights. Because of you, I like the dark. Sorry to leave you in the dark there, deputy. Oh. Oh, hey, there. Hey there, sheriff. I'm glad you're here. I was gonna go and check... See what happened to the lights. See, because... I can't operate without lights. You know, a man can't operate without lights, so... All right, that's about good right there. That's good. Yep. You're not gonna shoot me. I got everything you need right up in here. Any last words? Bitch! Where is it? - No. - Don't panic now. Fun's just started. You can't do this. It's my work. You think you know everything. You know nothing at all. Penelope. Are you okay? Are you okay? Hey, are you all right? All right. Hang on. Hey, it's Harris. I got Penelope. Okay, it's okay. It's gonna be okay. I got you. I got you. Sit here. Wait here. One of my men's on the way. I gotta go. Whoa. Enjoy the dark. No. Ahh... Let go of her, Duncan. Oh. Hey there, sheriff. Okay, sheriff. Okay, okay. Okay, sheriff. Okay, okay. Here's the deal. Turn around and go away. Otherwise, I'm gonna slice her from ear to ear. I'm gonna slice her and throw her over. - It ends right here, right now. - It does. You're right about that. You're right, sheriff. It does. It ends right here. Now turn around and go. So turn around. Mm-hm. Turn around. Turn around. Turn around! - All right. - Good boy. Good boy. Harris. You promised. Yep. I promised. Before you die, I have a gift for you. Don't kill me. - I don't wanna die. - Let me live. These are my girls. Not anymore. I'm taking them back. - And the life you stole from me. - Please don't kill me. I die, you die. I've been dead before. Welcome to the darkness. No. Maya? Maya? Maya, are you okay? Maya, come on. Come on, Maya. Come on. Maya, wake up. Come on, Maya. Come on, Maya. Wake up. Hmm. You all right? Come on. You got your life back. Thank you. Won't last long. She's good one more. Let's go, let's go. Yeah, if it'll run, let's try it. If it goes, it goes. If it doesn't, it doesn't. Back it up, and line it up to the jump. - Cut. - That was a cut. Come back, boys. Thank you very much.
