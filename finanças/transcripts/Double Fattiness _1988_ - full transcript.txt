See if it's correct. No need. I can trust you, Mr. Lin. Remember not to say it out loud. I know. This is not our first time working together. There's another good deal. Really? What is it? See it and you'll know. We're buying up this old building to build a high-class commercial complex. We have come to terms with most of the owners. We just couldn't settle with this flatbread shop. Fix it for me by hook or by crook. Forcing them out? No problem. It's not like we're not paying them. Well, how much is the company offering? The upper management approved three million dollars. Don't need so much. Just 1.5 million will do. How much the amount to be divided between us depends on you. The cheaper the offer, the more we get. But you have to hurry up. No problem. It's just a flatbread shop. It's easy to settle. TAI SHEK GROUP QUN SOU FLATBREAD SHOP Table number 15. Add onion and sesame. Enjoy yourselves. Table number 18. No onion. Enjoy yourselves. - Don't worry. - Bill, please! Okay. Bill? Please pay at the counter. Please come again. Table number four's bill. It's 55 dollars. Thank you. Keep the change. Thank you. That's enough. Have you seen enough? Yes. Both father and son are the same. You lose your mind when you see women. Government's advice to the citizens, smoking is hazardous to your health. Did I hire you to smoke? - Quickly get to work. - Okay. Hey. Your mom is very fierce today. Don't you know she is called Empress Wu? Let's have a ball game after work. No, today is my parents' 30th anniversary. I'm going to celebrate with them. You're quite filial. - Of course. Who am I? - Sonny! Coming! - Sonny! - Coming. Deliver it to 58, 6th Floor, Shan Kwong Road, Tat Bou Trading Company. Mom, I make the delivery every time. Can Lung make it this time? What do you think? Of course, not. You know it too. How many times have I told you? It's our own business. - You must do it yourself. - Do it ourselves. Deliver it quickly. - If it gets cold, it's not nice. - It will affect our reputation, right? QUN SOU FLATBREAD SHOP Go upstairs and rest if you're tired. I'm not that tired. Please have a seat inside. Are you Mr. Mo? I am Kam Tai Tse. I'm a representative of Tai Shek Group. I'm here to discuss... For discussion, please talk to my wife. This is her shop. - I see. - Kam Tai Tse? Mrs. Mo. What's the matter? I'm Kam Tai Tse. I'm a representative of Tai Shek Group. It's not up for discussion. My shop is not for sale. Mr. Wong has talked to us previously. He's no longer working with us. Well, the Tai Shek Group has settled everything with the other landlords. We're going to build a high-class commercial complex. You're the last landlord. Mrs. Mo, please name your price. Priceless! Mrs. Mo, if don't feel good naming your price, I'll name a price for you. See if you're satisfied. We've checked. Fifteen years ago, this shop and the house above were bought with a loan of 385,000 dollars from the bank with 20 years of installments, right? The current value is around 900,000 dollars. Your daily turnover is 1,200 dollars. Your net profit is 500 dollars. There are 365 days in a year. So, that would be 182,500 dollars. Including the cost of the premises, it's 1,082,500 dollars. Our company is now offering you 1.2 million dollars. You'd have something to gain. What's in it for you then? I just want to get this done. Also, when the new building is completed, you have the privilege to choose a nice shop. How big is it and how much per square feet? The price for this district won't be too high. At most, it's a little over 2,000 per square foot. That means it's over two million for the same space here. I'll have to pay more then. Only a little difference. You must have lost your mind. My old shop is only worth a million. And your new shop is worth two million. Do you know we struggled hard to pay the installments - and it took few years to pay up? - I know. You're asking us to pay installment again? - When would we get to pay it up? - No. - How and where are we going to live? - Hear me out. I hate profiteers like you! - Leave! I'm not listening to you. - Hear me out. - Leave! - Hear me out first. You're so stubborn. - Darling, you're awesome. - Of course. Sir. Yes. - What would you like? - Bill, please. Okay. Aren't you eating? No. Bill, please. Four cans of soft drinks. Ten dollars, please. What? Ten dollars? Is it 2.50 dollars each? It's only 2.20 dollars each at the supermarket. We only earn a low profit after paying our heavy overhead. Low profit? What a windfall! Boss, every business needs to make a profit. Let me do the talking. Sir, you're charging us ten dollars. Please give me the change of 9,990 dollars. Change of 9,990 dollars? Yes. Look. Well, we'll collect 10,000 each month. We'll ensure that you can do business in peace. Isn't that protection money? You can take it as garbage money! We're only doing a small business. We make very low profits only. We don't earn much. Let me pay for the soft drinks. Okay? What? Are you trying to throw us out with ten dollars? What are you taking us for? Boss. - Boss, let's talk it over. - There's nothing to talk about. Move! Screw you! Have some biscuits! Screw you! Bastard! Let go of my hand! I must teach you a lesson! Try this! Stop it! Cut it out! Charging me protection fee! Again? Take it! Go to hell! You're crushing me! Take it! Damn you! - Charging me protection money! - Get lost! Are you still not leaving? How outrageous! Stay if you have the guts! You'll be beaten to death. What's wrong, darling? Do you relapse again? Take things easy if your heart isn't well. How do you feel? Go up and rest. I'll clean this up first. BAI JIA SUPERMARKET Bag snatcher! Someone snatched my bag! Help! Bag snatcher! Miss, I'll go after him for you! Damn bike! Hurry up! BILLS ARE PROHIBITED. - Are you all right? - Yes. Miss, are you all right? I'm fine. Sir, please help to go after him. - My passport is inside it! - Okay, I'll go after him now! No. I'll go on foot. Hurry up. Stop! You're dead! Stand right there! Damn shorty. How dare you snatched? You must have some family problems. For instance, your dad fell sick. Your mom eloped with someone. Your elder brother didn't behave. Your brother gambled and left with debts. Is that why you have to resort to this? I feel sympathetic to your plight. So, I came after you to show my concern. I wonder if both the bosses behind you are satisfied with what I said? If you're satisfied, I would like to leave first. Boss, are you letting him go? Little shorty. Going after the thief? Leave quickly! Thanks for not killing me. You're generous and kind. - You're so passionate... - Quickly leave! Thank you! No way. How can I just leave like that? Hey. I've thought about it. The money. You can divide it among yourselves. But the passport, you won't be using it. Please give it back to me. Thank you. I won't take it for free. Here's the money. That's all I have. Take it. - How was it? - You're lucky to run into me. I took the passport back for you. What about the other things? Forget it. They're not valuable. Where are you going? I'm going to see my cousin. I'm going the same way. Let me send you. What's your name? I'm Diana. I just returned from Canada. What a coincidence. I'm Charles! I just returned from San Tao. Everybody calls me Sonny. - You can call me Sonny. - All right. - Let's go. - All right. Thank you. Don't mention it. All of you are idiots! You used to run roughshod over people. You said you're good fighters. But you can't even beat a fat lady. Don't you feel ashamed to see me? Leave! Hey! I have a cousin. She's coming back from Canada today. Go and meet her at the airport. Then, look for an apartment for her to stay temporarily. Then, tell her that I died recently and no need to look for me. Your cousin is really pretty. But I sprained my back just now. I must see a bonesetter now. Sorry, boss. Just say it if you don't want to go. Why are you talking nonsense? - Leave! - Okay. Whatever. It should be that shop. Thank you. Don't mention it. Hey. - Look for me when you're free. - All right. I live in front. Just turn left and right. That Qun Sou Flatbread Shop up the slope. - Just ask around and you'll know. - All right. Bye. Is there anyone around? May I ask... May I ask if Mr. Kam Tai Tse is here? Who's asking for him? I've just returned from Canada. I'm Diana, his cousin. You're my cousin? So, are you the girl in the photo? Right, it was years ago. I'm your cousin. Tai Tse! Tai Tse. Didn't you say you'll arrive tonight? Well, I took an earlier flight. I tried to call you, but there was no answer. So, I just checked into a hotel. No need to stay in the hotel. We're relatives. Move into my house. I'll help you do the checkout. Move into my house. Please wait for a while. QUN SOU FLATBREAD SHOP Dad. Is Mom really that awesome to beat four at a time this afternoon? Yes. Those hooligans raised hell while I wasn't around. If I were there, Mom didn't have to do that. Can you beat them? I didn't say I was going to beat them. I'll help to call the police. Chak Shu. Still not coming up to take a shower? I'm just done closing the books. Can I take a shower later? What do you think? Of course, not. Dad, don't argue with Mom. You'll never win. I'm not arguing. Your mom used to... Don't tell our son about my previous story. You heard it. - Come up when you're done. - Okay. Take a shower. You've prepared everything for me. Am I crippled? Don't I know how to do it myself? - Mom. - Yes. Mom, this afternoon, - I met someone... - Have you closed the gate? Yes. Mom, this afternoon... Have you cleaned the floor? Have you set the table? Switched off the light? Locked the door? Switched off the ventilator? Checked the gas stove? Yes, I've done all that. No, I forgot something. You're always like that. Remember to worship. I'm lighting the incense now. I've done that. Mom, this incense wasn't lighted by me. Your right hand. It's done. Your right foot. What's the date today? It's March 7. What about tomorrow? It's March 8. Anything special about these days? Well... International Women's Day! Why are the lights off? You must have forgotten to pay the bill! It's an automatic payment. Dad! Mom! Dad, Mom, here. Let's eat cake. Sonny, do you remember it too? Of course. Dad remembers it too, right? I know. It's your mom's birthday. Dad, today is your 30th wedding anniversary. - The 30th anniversary? - Yes. Yes, it's our 30th wedding anniversary. - You... - All right. I wish both of you will grow old together to be of one mind forever with an everlasting love. Actually, I think that after 30 years of marriage, the most successful thing you did is having a handsome son like me. - Good family lineage! - Blow the candles. That's great. - It's so dark. How do I cut the cake? - I'll go down and switch the lights on. Wait for me before you cut it. Sonny! Sonny, are you all right? I'm fine. Sonny, are you all right? No, I just had a bump. Next time, no need to go downstairs to switch off the lights. Just do it here. It's his good intention. You didn't help him and scold him instead? Don't quarrel. Let's cut the cake. Come on. HAPPY 30TH WEDDING ANNIVERSARY Sonny, the cake is pretty. Thank you. Enjoy yourselves. I'll eat downstairs. Well, we've been married for 30 years. No wonder you don't remember it. There are so many things to do in the shop. I'm busy all day and night. It's not a surprise if I don't remember. Forget it. What a shame. I actually prepared this. Didn't you say you forgot it? Did I ever forget it all these years? I just wanted to give you a surprise. - What have you bought? - What have you bought? - It's very old-fashioned. - So is mine. Why would it be the same? This is so-called two hearts, one soul. Together, they overcome all the obstacles together. What is it? I bought gold to hedge against inflation. I'm keeping it for our son's wedding. - I have the same thought. - All right. Let me keep it in the safety locker. Hey, isn't it for me? It is for you, but I'm keeping it for you. Hey, what are you laughing about? I was thinking of our wedding 30 years ago. That's right. It has been 30 years. You could still hold my waist back then, but not anymore. - You're right. - Hey. Do you still remember the first thing we did on that night 30 years ago? Yes. But I don't think you can make it now. Maybe not 30 years later. I can still do it now. Come on. - What if our son comes upstairs? - Hey. - All right. Stand by and I'll spring over! - Okay. - I can do it. - Hey. Don't force yourself if you can't. - I've put on more weight than before. - So did I. What is it, Siu Fung? Put me down if you're not strong enough. Put me down first! Dad is still as strong as before. Sonny, something bad happened to Mom! Siu Fung, how do you feel? Sonny! - Dad, what's wrong with Mom? - Call 999. She's having a heart attack. Siu Fung, where's your medicine? I just finished them. I thought of getting them from the doctor tomorrow. What now? Have you made the call? They're coming. Mom. Chak Shu. I think I won't make it this time. Won't make it? Darling, don't scare me. We still have to celebrate the 40th, 50th, 60th, 70th anniversary! Right! Mom, I'm not married yet. You have to attend my wedding. - That's right. - We have worked so hard to get this shop. You must keep it going. Let us keep it going together. Chak Shu. My greatest regret in life is that I've never taken a ride on a wedding sedan chair. Remember to burn one for me after I die. Darling, you're going to be all right. Why is the ambulance not here yet? Sonny. All my valuables are in the safe. - The safe. - It's under the shrine. The passcode is... - Siu Fung! - Mom! - Siu Fung! - Mom! SEDAN CHAIR LAMP Dad, should we burn it now? Of course. Other than mosquito bites, she is afraid of walking the most. She was fat and had heart disease. Burn the sedan chair quickly. That will save her lots of walking. Hey, have you bought the insecticide? - Is this the one? - Yes. Burn it. BRIDGE OF NO RETURN 5,000 STEPS AHEAD Both the father and son know I'm afraid of walking the most. And there are so many mosquitoes too! They promised to burn me a big sedan chair. There's still nothing yet. - Mrs. Mo! - Mrs. Mo! - Mrs. Mo! - Mrs. Mo! I was too quick to blame them. Mrs. Mo, please get in. What's this? They are really thoughtful. Rise! Hey! Hey, what are you doing? Nothing. ENTRY REGISTRATION Attention, all the deceased. After crossing the bridge, those who died of illness, turn left. Those who died of an accident, turn right. Those who died of unknown reason, go to the Inquiry Area at the center. Cross the bridge. It's done. Let's get off work. SEDAN CHAIR LAMP Mrs. Mo, please get off and go over there to go through the formalities. "Go through formalities"? Yes. You have to go through the formalities before crossing the Bridge of No Return. ENTRY Ma'am, what era is it now? Why are you still traveling on a sedan chair? My husband burnt it for me. Of course, I'll take a ride on it. Can't I ride on a sedan chair? All right then. I'll ask my husband to burn a car for me. I'll come by car next time. Ma'am. Forgive me for asking. What's your name? Luk Siu Fung. Luk Siu Fung, 47 years old. Your husband is Mo Chak Shu. Your son is Mo Tak Ko. - You died of a heart attack, right? - Yes. You died of illness then. Hold out your hand. Okay. - You may cross the bridge. - Okay. It's done. BRIDGE OF NO RETURN You can't cross the bridge on a sedan chair! Hey! I'm so scared! It's scaring the crap out of me! Get down. Stop. Stop! Ma'am, my back! Luckily, I've got you as a cushion. You're lucky. You nearly crushed me to death! Where's my sedan chair? Hey, where are my sedan chair and the carriers? They fell into the water. They are gone. What? How can that be? My husband burnt it for me! I don't care. You have to pay me. How about you pay me for the bridge? Why should I? Who told you to cross the bridge on a sedan chair? You're so heavy. So was the sedan chair. And there were another four carriers. Of course, it would collapse. Hey, are you blaming me? How would I know the bridge is so fragile? You blamed me for the collapse. I didn't know I couldn't cross the bridge on a sedan chair. Now, my sedan chair is gone. You didn't pay for my sedan chair, but asking me to pay for the bridge? Are you trying to bully me because I'm a woman? Someone is bullying a woman! - Someone is bullying a woman! - Fine! Ma'am! Ma'am. You don't need to pay it. I don't need to pay for the bridge. Then, pay for my sedan chair. Where do I get a sedan chair for you? Spirits like you must know magic. Just make one will do. If I know magic, I wouldn't have been crushed by you. What then? How would I know? The bridge has collapsed. You couldn't cross the bridge. Does it mean I can return? I don't know. Let me check. Hey, how is it? Got it. It's written here. "Those who haven't crossed the Bridge of No Return aren't dead." Am I not dead yet? It means I can go back to my husband and son? I think so. It's written like this here. Let me check again. What's there to check? You'd better return quickly! If anything happens, I'll report you. All right. Let's go. Mr. Mo, your wife is in there already. Just push this button will do. Dad, go on. I can't do it. Press it like you're taking an elevator. Your mom presses it for me every time we take an elevator. Sonny, you do it. Mom used to press it for me too. Let's press it together. Hey, don't press it! Hey, don't burn me! I'm not dead yet! They can't hear you. Possess the body now before they burn your body. - How to possess? - Move! Sonny! Chak Shu! Sonny! Hey, Sonny! I'm not dead yet. Darling. Hey! - What should I do? - How would I know? Let me apply a place for you in the refugee camp. What? Do you want me to stay in the refugee camp? You bully me because I'm a woman. I know the rules. As long as I haven't crossed the Bridge of No Return, I'm not dead. You've burned my body. I want you to compensate one for me. - I want to possess a body. - All right. I'll get a body for you. Hey, listen up. Find me a nice body. My husband has been with a fat woman for years. I want to give him something good. I want someone tall, slim, pretty - and young. - Found it! - Follow me. - Okay. - Hello. - Sing. Stop! Luckily, we make it. - Let's go. - Okay. Three people will be dead and five injured in this accident. Pick one. Hey, how is it? Hey, that one! She's not dead yet. She merely got a sprain. How about that? She merely sprained her leg. I can't pick any of them. What should I do? That one. She fits you best. She is fat and young too. Am I very old? I've told you. I don't want to be a fat lady anymore. That one then. Her size, figure and looks are the best. She fits your requirements. Her name is Diana. She's 23 years old and just got back from Canada. Her parents are gone. She only has a cousin in Hong Kong. How is it? That's great. If I possess her, I'll be pretty. My husband will surely like me. I'm not interested to know if your husband would like you. But you must remember the rules of possession. What is it? First, once you've possessed, you can't get off. Second, you couldn't regret it. Goods sold are not returnable. Third. You must not reveal your identity to others. Okay. What if I accidentally revealed it? No idea, the book makes no reference to this. That's great then. Is there anything else? Yes, but this is not about the rules. It's a word of advice from me. What is it? Don't ever reveal this to any of the hell officers. Why? I'm helping you secretly. If my superiors know about it, I'll be sacked and become a specter. If anything happens after the possession, how can I look for you? Do you still want to look for me? What if anything happens to me? Where should I call for help? What should I do if the hell officers question me? All right. - Call me if there's anything. - Okay. Hey, how do I call you? There's no phone number! Light this and I'll appear. One for each call. Hurry up. Time is running out. My leg. QUN SOU FLATBREAD SHOP Dad, you need to catch the bread with the sieve, not your face. I know, but I can't catch it. Again. Here I come. Table number four. Table number eight! Don't toss so hard. Table number 16. - Table number six! - Hey! Dad! Dad, are you all right? I'm fine. But everything is not fine without your mom. Open up! Open up! Sonny, I'm back! It's you? I really missed you! Close the door. Chak Shu. Close the door? Chak Shu. Who are you? - You don't know me? I'm... - Of course, he doesn't know you. Dad, she's my girlfriend, Diana. She just got back from Canada. No, Sonny. I'm your mom... I'm your wife... Right. I can't say it. You serve her. I'll go upstairs. Okay. Good night, Dad. - Diana, why do you come... - Why is it such a mess here? My mom just passed away. In the past, my mom used to stand here and toss the bread everywhere. She was awesome. - We just couldn't learn it. - Now you know how bad it is without her. Yes. Let's drop the topic. Let me make you a cup of tea. Would you like it cold or hot? MRS. MO, FOREVER IN OUR HEART Siu Fung. We can't do anything without you. - Mom! - What? Mom, I brought my girlfriend, Diana, to visit you. Here. Worship my mom. Knock on wood! How can I worship myself? Chak Shu. Here. Worship my mom. Here. Place the incense. - Bow down. - Must I do that? First bow. - Second bow. - Anything goes. - Third bow. - Knock on wood. All right. Family members to return the salutation. Thank you, Ms. Tai. Chak Shu. Sonny, take care of Ms. Tai. I'm going to take a shower. - Hey, are you going to take a shower? - Diana... Please hold on. What is she doing? Dad, look how nice she is to you. So great. Chak Shu, you can take a shower now. Go. Siu Fung. What is it? All women are the same! Do you think I'm crippled? Don't I know how to squeeze the toothpaste? Dad is like that. Mom controlled him for years. He has a weird temper. Don't blame him. Hey, do you know? When my mom was still around, she was very fierce. My dad and I don't dare to say anything in front of her. Do you think I'm very fierce? I wasn't talking about you. I was talking about my mom. My dad and I secretly called my mom Empress Wu behind her back. Hey, what are you doing? No, you were right with what you said downstairs. When Mom was around, we thought she was fierce. Now that she's gone, we feel so miserable. Do you only know that now? No, I've known it for a long time. A woman is the soul of a home. So, I want to find one for myself. You're here too. Sonny. Listen to me. Actually, I am your mom... Why do I keep sneezing today? The weather isn't that cold. - Hey, come here. - Where to? - You're here because of my mom. - Yes. She sent you here to look after me. Sorry. I was too excited. Sorry. Let me talk to my mom first. Mom, thank you. You've blessed us. Now, we can continue our family's bloodline. Our family will produce more offspring. We can continue the bloodline and make more talents for the country. You can rest in peace now. Don't worry about me. I can settle down now. Dad is the only one left now. Come and visit him when you're free. He misses you a lot. - Has she left? - No, she went into your room. - She's in my room? - Yes. Hey, open the door! - Open the door! - Diana, open the door. Hey, what are you doing in my room? This is my dad's room. Mine is over there. Hey! How is it? Does it resemble me? Come here. Sit down. - Right foot. - What right foot? Hey, what are you doing? Helping you to cut your toenails. - Cut toenails? Are you crazy? - Diana. What are you doing? Why are you behaving like a maniac? I'm crazy? All of you are the crazy ones. I've done so many things, but you still couldn't recognize me? Of course, I do. These are my wife's glasses. I bought this pair of earrings for her. This is her favorite outfit. Are you using her powder too? She couldn't bear to use it too! You'd better leave now. Sonny, see her out! Hey! Are you chasing me away? How could you do that? Are you out of your mind? I'm your wife! I've kept this to myself for a long time! You didn't like me taking care of you. Why didn't you say it? I was nice to you, but you said I was fierce. I took care of everything for you, yet you said I'm Empress Wu? Don't you have a heart? Also... This photo is gross! Why can't you find a better one? Take it! Why did you break my wife's photo? Why were you poking us? Poke us! Leave quickly! - Leave. - Chak Shu, don't chase me away. - Leave. - Listen to me. - Leave. - Chak Shu. - Listen to me. - Don't you come here again! - Dad. - Let me explain it. - Take your things. - Don't chase me away. - Hey! - Dad, don't do that. - Diana! - Go upstairs! - Hey! - Dad. - Chak Shu, listen to me! - What is it? You can't chase me away. Sonny! Chak Shu! Chak Shu! Sonny! Sonny, quickly open the door! Sonny! Diana, don't leave just yet! When Dad has fallen asleep, I'll go down and open the door for you. You're not allowed to open the door. Move! You're thick-skinned. Leave! Chak Shu! Hey, open the door! Hey! Sonny, sleep earlier. We have to work tomorrow. Okay. I don't get to sleep, but you want to sleep. I'm your wife. I'm your mom. I'm your wife. I'm your mom. Why are you looking like that? We have a fancy ball in the underworld and I played a vampire. Do I look like it? You nearly scared me to death. Don't worry. You can't die yet. Hey, why did you call me? Tell me quickly. The party will be over soon! It was all your fault. I couldn't cross the bridge and die because of you. - It's my fault again? - Why is it not? It was all your fault. You gave me this body to possess, but don't allow me to reveal my identity. Now, none of them could recognize me. They thought I was really dead. What should I do? Ma'am, you chose that body yourself. I didn't make the rules. Why do you blame me? If not you, who else? Should I blame myself? Should I blame my husband or the King of Hell? Should I blame Guanyin? Jesus Christ? Just put the blame on me. What do you want me to do? I want my husband to know that I'm not dead yet and I've possessed another woman's body. Get it done for me quickly! All right. There's only one way. - But don't ever tell anyone. - Okay. Inform your husband in his dream. Just tell him that you've possessed another woman's body. Will it work? It's the only way. But you still can't tell him which woman is that. Hey, what is he doing? Dreaming. What dream makes him so happy? How would I know? You'll know in a short while. What else is there to eat? Braised pork, Your Highness. Chak Shu. I'm not dead yet. But you've burned my body. So, I can only possess another woman's body. Who have you possessed? I can't tell you. But I'm the one who will solve the problems for you tomorrow. You bastard! You're having such a dream. Wake up quickly! It's time to open the shop! What? It's already so late. Number 16, add sesame and onion. Number eight with onion. No sesame. Enjoy yourself. What would you like? Chak Shu, you're awake. You're awake? Why is she still here? Luckily, she's here to help us out or else we couldn't handle it. Number 13, Man Kun Building, Jaffe Road, Wangchai. I would like to accompany you. Get Lung to deliver it. What do you think? Of course not. It's your own business. You must do it yourself. You must be from the same hometown as my mom. Even your tone is the same as hers. Go quickly! It'll taste bad when it's cold. That would affect our reputation. Could she have possessed her? Dad, look how awesome Diana is. She can take over Mom's place. I suspect that she's your mom. That's outrageous. Let me make it clear. She can be my son's mom. She can't be your son's mom. I'll show no mercy in love even if you're my dad. - Don't do silly things. - No. Yesterday, your mom was in my dream. She told me she isn't dead yet and she has possessed another woman's body. What a nonsense. Did she inform you in your dream? I dreamt of myself playing mahjong with Mom. She didn't mention it to me. - Didn't she? - Table number 16. Sesame with onion. Here. Enjoy it while it's hot. You... How is it? I've taken care of everything. Are you really Siu Fung? It's impossible. It was just a dream. Hey, you're not dreaming. Leave. No need to pay. It's my treat! - Hey, boss! - Leave! We're doing business. You keep coming here. What do you want? Hey, your wife is dead. No one can protect you now. Says who? I'm here! Little girl, do you want to fight? Maybe we can go for a movie together? Go to hell! Go to hell! It hurts! Hey, did you hurt yourself? - Hey! Put me down! - Let's go! - I can walk on my own! - Move. Hey! - One, two. - One, two. - Three! - Help! The fat lady isn't dead yet. - Let's go. - Let's go. Why would I be here? No, she's not me. Sir, are you all right? Siu Fung, you're really back. Siu Fung? You're mistaken. I'm not Siu Fung. You can't say it. You can't admit it. - You've misunderstood. I'm really not... - Hey! Who are you? Why do you look like me? How is she like you? Where are you from? Who sent you here? Diana, what are you talking about? - Hey, where are you going to? - Cousin. So you're here? "Cousin"? Is she your cousin sister? Yes, she's my cousin, Diana. Isn't that fat lady dead? Why did she come back to life? So, you sent her here as a spy! Go away. - I'm not. - No need to say it. No wonder you imitated every movement of my wife. Even the way she made and tossed the bread. Luckily, my wife is back now. Or else, I'd have fallen into your trap. - Chak Shu, I... - How can you call me Chak Shu? You'd better leave. I'm definitely not selling my shop! Lung, hold this. Look after the shop. I'll be right back. Okay. Let me tell you. When I get back later, I don't want to see the two of you here! - Hey... - Diana. Were you here the whole night? You can actually come up with such an idea to disguise as the fat lady to be a spy. - I told you it's not! - It's all right. I have a way to make them sell the shop. They'll be in trouble tomorrow. - In trouble? - Yes. How is it? We can't talk about it in public. Let's go back and talk. Ms. Tai, your bag. Look after the shop! - Take it easy. - It's slippery. I'm scared. - We're holding you. Don't be scared. - Hold me. Sir, you haven't put on your skate shoes. - I don't know how to skate. - You can't go in then. We're leaving. - Learn it slowly. - We're leaving. Be careful. It's you. How should I address you? My name is Cho Siu Heong. What about you? I'm Mo Chak Shu. You should remember it. - Let me hold you. - Let's go and play. Hey, wait up. - Do you know him? - I don't. I ran into him on the street just now. He's not bad. He's a little old, but suits you well. Don't talk nonsense. It's not nonsense. Don't you want that? That's right. You've been longing for this chance. I told you it's not. Ms. Cho, here I come. - Go! - What are you doing? Mr. Mo, are you all right? I'm fine. - What's the matter? - My hand. What's the matter? I don't feel a thing. What now? Let me accompany you to the doctor. How do I go home after that? I'll send you home then. All right. - Get up. - All right. Do you work here? Diana. Were you lost yesterday and you've lost your mind? You've been here before. Here. Take my card. You won't get lost anymore. It's you again! Beat her up! What are you doing? How dare you lay hands on my cousin? - But just now, she... - Cut the crap. Get inside. You were scared like chickens when you saw that fat lady. Hear me out. I have an idea. I'll make her shop close down. Get me 500 cockroaches tonight. No problem. No problem? Do it yourself then! What do we do with the cockroaches? Tomorrow, before nine o'clock in the morning, put all the cockroaches in the shop. I'll call the Health Department. When the Health Inspector comes, they'll be screwed. Boss, you're awesome. Hey, time is running out. Go and find the cockroaches quickly. Okay. Diana, where are you going? I'm going to see an ex-classmate. Come back earlier for dinner tonight. Have you got the address? I'll remind you of that. Here. FAMOUS FLATBREAD, DELICATE APPETIZERS Why is it so quiet? No business at all. He's sleeping. Lung. Hey, wake up. Mr. Mo and Mrs. Mo. Mo... What are you afraid of? This is Ms. Cho. You met her this afternoon. Ms. Cho. Take a seat first. - Mr. Mo, is your hand all right? - I'm all right. - Where's Sonny? - He isn't back yet. Where did he go to? Mr. Mo, if there's nothing else, I would like to leave first. All right. Come earlier tomorrow. Okay. Bye. Darling. No, it's Ms. Cho. Let's go upstairs. Go upstairs? Where to? We live upstairs. It's not convenient. I'd better leave. Don't. Sonny is coming back. Don't you want to see him? How about this? Take a seat here. I'll go upstairs to apply the medicine. Then, I'll get you some photos to see. Let them jog your memories. All right? - All right. - Wait here for me. - Lung, did you get off this late? - That's right. Did Diana come back? No, but your mom is back. Don't say that. It's not even a week since she died. Lung didn't even switch off the lights. Sonny. Dad! Did she really come? Amitābha! Sonny, are you all right? Don't come over. Don't. Come out here. I'm not coming out! Mom. I know you miss us a lot. Dad and I miss you too. We wanted to go and visit you. But we have the shop to take care of and I'm not married yet. When I get married, I'll visit you with my wife. Mom, don't scare me. I'm not your mom. Get up first. Sonny, what are you doing? Dad! Dad, why would it be like this? I've told you that your mom informed me in the dream that she has possessed someone. That's her. She wouldn't admit it now. She can't admit it. - If so... - Don't call her as mom just yet. Mr. Mo, I know both of you miss Mrs. Mo a lot. But trust me. I'm not her. - You're not. - You're not. - Don't admit it. - That's right. Don't admit it. - I'll go first. - Hey. - Aren't you staying here? - Take it easy. Where can I find you? The Catholic Diocese Centre, Happy Valley. Catholic Diocese. Hold this. Let me see you out. - No need. I can go back on my own. - I can call a taxi for you. - I'll look for you tomorrow. - All right. Why are you here? Why are you here then? She's here for me. Not for you. I'm here for him. Me? Why? - Why is she here for you then? - I'll leave first. Hey, wait! There are many cars here. We must hold hands to cross the road. Diana, where have you been? I didn't see you after delivering the food. Hey, how long has she been here? No idea. I just got back and she was already here. You just got back? You're back so late. Don't you need to work? Hey! Why are you still here? Leave! - Dad, what are you doing? - Do you know who is she? - She's Diana. - That property representative's cousin. She's a spy. - How can that be? - You're still not leaving? - How dare you chase me away? - It's not the first time I do that. Sonny, get back here! Chak Shu, listen to me. I'm not listening. Leave! Sonny, get back here! I'll cut ties with you if you're still not coming back! Don't come back if you have the guts! All right. So be it! I won't come back again! - You don't treat me well. You're selfish! - Hey. You never think of my future. You never think about me. I've never had any girlfriends. She's the only one. Diana, let's get out of here. Let's leave here! I'm severing the ties with my dad for your sake. I'll leave him to be by himself. I won't care even if he turns into an old monster. Bad son! He's your dad! Are you cursing him? I was just saying it. I need not bear responsibility for that. I'll just choose something else. - In short, you must get in there tonight! - Get in there? That would be embarrassing. Haven't you been embarrassed before? That's right. Sonny, listen up. Prepare more traps for cockroaches. Got it? - Cockroaches? - That's right. The property representative asked someone to put cockroaches. Then, he'll report it to the Health Department. You must be prepared. Your dad is useless. Where will you go tonight? I'm going back to his place and see what else is he up to. You're walking into his trap. It's dangerous! - It's a long night. You're a girl... - It's enough. I'll be back tomorrow morning. All right? Dad, open the door! I know it's my fault! Diana. You're back. Hey, where's my room? That one. Hey, come up! Are you trying to trouble me? You're calling me at this hour? I'm taking a shower. You're putting me in trouble. Why is there another fat lady here? She looks every inch like my former self! Of course my husband will ignore me! What do I do now? Ma'am, I'm only in charge of the entry in the underworld. How would I know about the affairs in the living world? What? You don't know? Do you think you can just get off by saying that? I wanted to reunite with my husband! Now, there's another fat lady! What should I do? Tell me! You're better now. You have a good figure. Many men will be after you. I don't like other men. I want my husband to like me. Diana. - Diana. - Hey. - What's he trying to do? - You can tell by his look. She really has fallen asleep. That's great. Good things come to those who wait. He's really outrageous. This only happens in the living world. It won't happen in the underworld. Cut the crap. Save her. It doesn't concern me. It doesn't concern you? Go! Hey! - What are you doing? - I... I... I'm just asking you to eat. The meal is ready. - Eat? - Yes. All right. What a nice atmosphere. - Right. Take a seat. - All right. Thank you. Diana, drink the soup. Try my cooking. All right. It's been a while since I had such a tasty soup. Diana. I wish that you'll soon find a nice guy like me in Hong Kong. All right. Diana, cheers! Tai Tse, what's the matter? Let me get the steak. Hey, what should I do later? Let's screw him up. Diana, I know you love to eat steak. So, I've specially bought the best steak here. Tai Tse, are you all right? I... Paper, scissors, rock! Scissors, rock, paper! It's fine now. I must be too nervous. Take it easy. Tai Tse. Let's chat. All right. Tai Tse. Why would I be like this? Hey, Diana, open up! How dare you molest me? You must be out of your mind! Hey, wake up. I've got out. QUN SOU FLATBREAD SHOP Hey, Ms. Tai. You're early. Are you here to help? Yes. You've never been this early. How does she know? Chak Shu! Sonny! Chak Shu! Diana, you're early. - Where's your dad? - Dad? He dressed up nicely and went to see Mom. He said we get a day off. Damn him. Check if there's any cockroach. I've searched upstairs, there isn't any. I'm here to search. Search again! We'll be screwed even if there's one. Find it. Lung, help to check if there's any cockroach. - Cockroaches? - Yes. Okay. There are many cockroaches here! - It's like an army of them. - What should we do? Cut the crap. Quickly catch them. I'll beat you to death! Still running? Still running? Spray you to death. QUN SOU FLATBREAD SHOP QUN SOU SPECIALTY Is anyone here? Is there anything? We've got a complaint that there are many cockroaches here. Cockroaches? No! - No? Let me check first. - No. FAMOUS FLATBREAD Hey, take care of it. - Let's go. - Sir. Go slowly and take a good look. I will. What are you doing? What are you doing? Nothing? Open your mouth. Open your mouth! All right. I've checked. There are no cockroaches here. Someone must have simply made a call. But let me tell you. Insecticide isn't good too. Got it? - That's all. - Thank you. How are you? Miss, may I know where Ms. Cho is? Lecture room at ninth floor. Ninth floor? Thanks! Hi, darling! Darling, here I am. Mr. Mo, I've told you that I'm not your wife. Sorry. I forgot. Why are you here? I'm here to date you. - Professor Wong. - Professor Wong. I need to attend the class. We've invited a musician from America to discuss music with us. Leave first. Go on. I'll wait for you over there. Go ahead. Everyone. Today, I'll tell you the difference between Western and Chinese music. Western music has a shorter history than Chinese music. But it keeps on developing unlike Chinese music. How should I say it? It stops developing. It's just like a dead fish. This is a cool world. I'm not saying that Chinese music is not good. But it's basically confined to just five notes. So, it's cooped up. Besides, it's within a narrow confine. Western music can surely do what Chinese music does. Western music is full of changes. The Chinese music might not be able to cope with the things we do, right? I'm not saying that Chinese music is not good. But I personally feel that these things can be eliminated. Everyone, "Hungarian Dance." "Hungarian Dance"? Ready. No one says that Western music is not good. But if you don't know about it, don't criticize Chinese music. Let me tell you. In order to play Chinese instruments, you need to have five basic skills of Gong, Yu, Ting, Yin, Chi. What? No cockroaches? Is the Health Inspector blind? Did he accept a bribe? There are dozens of cockroaches, but you said there's none? Check again! Hello? What did you do? The Health Inspector said there's no cockroach. But we did put them in the kitchen. Yes, we caught 534 of them. Yes, boss. There's no problem. No problem? Even the inspector said so too. You only know how to live off me. No, we need to do something worse. Burn the shop tonight. That's serious. What if someone dies? Don't be silly. Most of the people have moved out from that building. Set fire at the back door. Let them flee through the front door. What if they don't wake up and can't escape? Well... Let them die then. We can't bear the burden for this crime. Yes, arson and murder are serious crimes! It's fine to just fight and scare people off. Arson and murder? No. Hey. You're always living off me. Now, you're just leaving me when I'm in trouble? Boss, we'll do the same anyway. Thanks for looking after us. Hey! Hey! Damn you! You have no sense of camaraderie! Diana, let's eat. - Let's eat. - Where did he go? Who? Your dad. Of course, he's out enjoying with Mom. I told you she's not your mom! She looks like her. That doesn't make her your mom. Your dad is useless. He doesn't take it when he's given such a good opportunity. He looks for someone who's even fatter than me. Were you very fat in the past? I wonder what has that woman given to your dad. He has fallen for her completely, hasn't he? Yes, I thought so too. How is it possible for her to resemble my mom? I think she's putting up an act. She did a plastic surgery and disguised as my mom. Or she is probably a witch who's here to seduce Dad to steal his soul and life. First, she makes him spellbound and obsessed with her. Then, she will wreak havoc. Finally, she'll kill him and destroy the evidence. When you read the newspaper, you'll see the headline, "Bloodbath in Qun Sou Flatbread Shop." "The Mo Family Tragedy." What is this nonsense? Sonny, we're back! He's back. - Have a seat. I'll get a towel for you. - All right. Witch! You're a witch! You seduce my dad to steal his soul and life! You're after his wealth and life! You make him spellbound and obsessed with you! Then, you'll wreak havoc. Then, you'll kill him and destroy the evidence. You'll see the headline in every newspaper, "Bloodbath in Qun Sou Flatbread Shop." "The Mo family tragedy." - Are you? - What do you have to say? What did you say? - It's none of your business! - No manners! - Dad. - Who taught you to be so rude? How did your mom educate you? Who taught you that? I did. So? Why are you beating him? What has he done wrong? Is this how you treat your son? That fat lady is not your wife. You treat her as your wife. You old fool, scum! No need. Let me scold him. You're an old fool! Why are you scolding your dad? Who taught you that? Who taught you that? Bad son! I'll slap your mouth! I'll wake you up! I can scold him! You can't scold him! He's your dad after all! - I'll slap you. Bad son! - Ms. Cho! - Chak Shu. - Diana! - Ms. Cho! - Chak Shu, where are you going? It's none of your business! Diana, where are you going? It's none of your business! None of my business? Darling, open the door! Open up! Open up! Mr. Mo, please leave. Please don't disturb me anymore. Darling, listen to my explanation. No need to explain to me. We're not related. Let me tell you once more. I'm not your wife. All right. I won't call you that. Can you please open the door? Please leave. I won't open the door. I won't leave if you don't open the door. Please open up. - Please? - Sir. It's so noisy. Who are you looking for? I'm looking for Ms. Cho. Mr. Wong, I don't know him! Hey, she said she doesn't know you. - She knows me. She was my wife. - Leave or I'll call the police. Leave. Leave. You're disturbing us. Leave. BLOCK 7 Ms. Cho! Please open the door and listen to my explanation! Ms. Cho! Open the door! Listen to my explanation! It's pouring out here! Could you bear to leave me out here? Ms. Cho, open the door! Ms. Cho! Ms. Cho! - Open the... - Old man, why are you making noise? Do you know what time it is? You're disturbing our sleep! Go somewhere else to look for your wife! How old are you? How embarrassing! If you don't leave, I'll call the police! Leave! Damn you! He's calling for his wife. Does it concern you? He's not calling for your wife! Why are you so worried? Take some pills if you can't sleep! Go to hell! How are you? Damn you! Are you trying to kill us? Try again if you dare. I'm not afraid of you! Come on! You're closing your window? Don't go! Come down if you dare! Fight with me! I'm not scared of you! Are you bullying a woman? Chak Shu! Chak Shu, don't go. Listen to my explanation. Listen up! Get out of my sight at once! I don't want to see you whenever and wherever. Not even in hell! Do you hear me? Hey! What are you doing here? Come in first. Have a cup of hot tea. Thank you. - Just now, I... - I... You go first. Sorry for scolding you earlier. It's fine. I know you've misunderstood me. Mr. Mo and I are just friends. I know. - I'm here to ask you... - Don't worry. I know how you feel about him. I won't see him anymore. No. I would like to ask you to accept him. Stop making fun of me. We're both women. No men would like fat women. I know it well. You're wrong. Chak Shu is sincere to you. He likes you because you're fat. Look. Do you think he is a fool? He doesn't want someone who is so young, pretty and slim, but he wants someone like me? He's not a fool. He's loyal. He really likes you, not me. I'd rather be like you now. You'd rather be like me? I'm fat and clumsy. Since young, people have been calling me a fat girl. Now, I've turned into a jumbo. Even I don't like myself now. Do you want to be like me? You've got to be kidding me. I used to hate my own figure too. But right now, I'd rather be fat like you. Really? All right. Let's have a switch the next time we are reincarnated. Ms. Cho. Please trust me for once. Chak Shu likes you no matter who you are. He doesn't like you and I don't like him. Why are you being so worried? Who are you to him? I'm... I can't say it. Even if I say it, you wouldn't be able to hear it. How would I not be able to hear it? Don't say it if you don't want to. But even if you don't tell, I can roughly guess it. Guess it! I guess you're his student. You have an affair with him. No. You're his mistress. His deceased wife didn't know about it. Does he dare to have a mistress? No. So, you are... - Guess it. - You are... You almost got it. Guess it. Are you trying to say his wife has possessed your body? I can't say it. I can't say it. His deceased wife rose from the dead and now she has possessed your body? I can't say it. I can't say it. I don't believe it. What century are we in now? Is there reincarnation? I don't believe it. There is. Trust me. There really is. I don't believe it unless you can prove it. - Proof? - Yes. Sure. I can show up in your dream. Close your eyes and count to ten. I can prove it to you. - What dream? - Don't ask so much. Just count. One, two, three, four. This is a phone recording. Please leave your name and contact number after the beep. I'll contact you as soon as possible. Ms. Cho, I'm Mo Tak Ko. I'm Mo Chak Shu's son, Sonny. - Come quickly. - Sonny? My dad is committing suicide because of you. Please come and save him! Dad, don't. - No! - Sonny! Sonny! Ms. Cho! Ms. Cho, wake up! - Come. - Hey. Why did you hit me? Don't ask. Follow me. Chak Shu is committing suicide. QUN SOU FLATBREAD SHOP Hurry up. - Chak Shu, open the door! - Mr. Mo, open the door! Sonny! - Mr. Mo, open the door! - Sonny! Hurry, open the door! - Dad, have you changed the water? - I have. I'll go down first. Hurry up. - Okay. - Sonny, open the door! - Sonny. - Open up. - Come in. - Okay. Dad, they're coming upstairs. Dad, don't! Mr. Mo! - Don't come over. - Chak Shu. Chak Shu, why are you doing this? - That's right. Let's talk things over. - Yes. I've told you everything. You were fierce to us when you were alive. But after you died, we realized you did it for our own good. So, we miss you after you died. After you told me in the dream that you aren't dead and has possessed someone's body, we were so happy that you can reunite with us. We waited for you. But you just wouldn't admit it. What else can I do? I can only die to save you. Mr. Mo, don't. Listen to me. How can I admit it if I'm not? I didn't expect you to be so cruel. You still wouldn't admit it. I'll commit suicide and wait for you at the Bridge of No Return. Chak Shu! Dad! - Chak Shu, how are you? - Dad. - Dad, are you all right? - Are you all right? How are you feeling? - Darling. - I told you I'm not. You still wouldn't admit it. You're so cruel to me. All right. Let's be cruel then. Let's burn the house and the shop. Bring it down with us! - Don't! - Let me stop him. - Don't! - Don't! - Mo Chak Shu! - No! - Don't! - Don't! - Dad! - Don't burn it! Let me ask you once more. Will you admit it? Ms. Cho, admit it for now. - If not, Chak Shu will really... - All right. I admit it. I'm Siu Fung. Chak Shu, look. She has admitted. Yes. You should have admitted it earlier. - It's settled. - Yes. Siu Fung, we can reunite now. QUN SOU FLATBREAD SHOP Why would it be like this? Mom! Is your neck all right? - You scared me to death. - I'm okay. Anything can be talked over. I was more afraid than you. Darling, I'm all right now. - Did I scare you? - It's your fault. Diana, it's settled between Mom and Dad. It's our turn now. Sonny, be nice to your dad. I'm leaving. What are you saying? Come with me. Everything in the safe is yours. You don't know the codes yet, right? Of course, I don't. Do you? Of course, I know. Here. Remember, it's triple six. Diana, could you be my... Fire! Dad, fire! Come down quickly! - Leave quickly! - All right. What should we do? Damn! We can't open the gate. What do we do? - Use the back door. - Go! - Go upstairs. - All right. Sonny, hurry. Open the window. - What's the code? - Only Mom knows it. Sonny, it's triple six. Are you really my mom? Cut the crap. Open it quickly! - It's opened! - Good. Sonny, you jump first. - Sonny. - Go on. Take it easy. Don't be scared. Be careful. - Grab tight. - That's right. Go over there and jump. Go. - Take it easy. - Be careful. - Be careful. - Sonny, jump! - Are you really Siu Fung? - I've given you hints many times. - Ms. Cho! - It's fine. It's spreading up. Jump first. We'll meet down there. - Ms. Cho, we have to leave quickly. - No. Here. Jump down from here. - It's so high! - It's just the first floor. - I can't get through it! - Jump! - Jump! - Try the other side! - Jump! - Don't be scared! It's too small! I can't get out! - Sonny, let's save Mom. - Mom! - Let's go. - Do you want to die? - The fire is too big. - No way! Come. Over there. Go to the washroom! We're screwed. I might suffocate to death even if I'm not burnt to death. I'm scared. I don't want to die just yet. Don't be afraid. No need to fear death. I have tried it before. Didn't you say if we reincarnate, you want to swap bodies with me? Trust me. I have a way to rise from the dead. Hurry up. I'm tired. Even so, you still have to walk. It'll be over soon. Is it true that if we collapse the bridge, we don't have to die? - Yes. Let's go. - Okay. Remember! When we get up there, you must possess Diana's body. I know. You'll possess my body. You can be with your husband then. Both of us will benefit from that. Attention, all the deceased. After crossing the bridge, those who died of illness, turn left. Those who died of an accident, turn right. - It's done. You may cross the bridge. - Thank you. Hey, wait! Where's the mustache officer? He has been fired. - Why? - Because of you. He collapsed the bridge while he was on duty. And he went to the living world without permission, so he was fired. What then? Don't worry. "Those who haven't crossed the Bridge of No Return aren't dead." Does this rule still apply? Yes. - What's your name? - Come. Hey! You haven't registered yourselves! - Hurry. Let's collapse the bridge. - Hey! Let's break it! BRIDGE OF NO RETURN Go harder! Why doesn't it break? We're screwed this time. Fate is predestined. Your life has also been predestined. Some people die without getting sick. Do you think you can break the bridge by stumbling on it? It's new. It will not collapse no matter how you stumble on it. Great! We can't cross the Bridge of No Return. You should have told me earlier. I just found out just now. When I found out, it was on fire already. - Then... - Let's move them. Don't move! They might come back to life! - What? The bodies are stiff already. - Don't move! Forget it. Let's wait for a while. Crazy! You're the crazy one! - Mrs. Mo? - Ms. Cho? - Siu Fung! - Mom! Chak Shu! Sonny! - Mom, did you resurrect? - Darling, are you all right? I'm not. Mr. Mo, I'm Ms. Cho. - We know. - You can't say it. - It's not. - Hey! She's not your wife. I am. - We know you're Ms. Cho. - I understand everything now. - Want to be my Mom? You'll be a mistress. - Damn you! Why did you hit me? Subtitle translation by Angel Choo
