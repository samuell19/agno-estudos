[EERIE MUSIC PLAYING] Good afternoon. First time here? Yeah. [LAUGHS NERVOUSLY] Looks like you're going to have the whole place for yourself. It's slow today. Great. It's best to take it easy with the sauna if you're not used to it. If you have any problems, call me. My name is Josh, and I'm a licensed physical therapist. Thanks. The changing room is back there. Okay. It's only women on Thursday. [EERIE MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PICKS UP TEMPO] [WHISPERING] Veronica. Close your eyes. What if someone sees? Let your dreams eat you. Hi, we're here to meet our girlfriend. Her name is Veronica. If she shows. She's blond, tall, kind of shy. Yeah, she's already here. She's enjoying the steam room by now. Great. See, I told you she'd be here. I don't believe it. Hi. So, you decided to come after all? Listen, I'm sorry we're late. But I made Ted help this poor guy jumpstart his car. The guy wasn't even that cute. You know, when you have that lost puppy dog look? And Sheri's always ready to take in another stray. Yeah, Mother Teresa in a mini skirt. You know, I called you last week to see if you wanted to have lunch, and you never returned my phone call. I'm really sorry. I got your message. But I had an appointment with my uh... Shrink? Tedra, do you have any sense of tact, whatsoever? I thought this was the concept? We girls get together and we talk about our sex lives? There is more to life than just sex, you know? Without sex, I would not have a life. Amen! So, what have you been up to? I was just laying low, doing some reading. You know what they say, idle hands do the devil's work. So, what's it like to be a certified bimbo, Tedra? How many times do I have to tell you? I am not... certified. [GIGGLING] Listen, I'm a woman with a healthy appetite for physical and spiritual pleasure. That guy in the front counter looked kind of tasty. If you're into French food. I wonder if he gives massages. Ah, so she is into French food. I had a massage once. A very, naughty massage. It was, when I was going out with that guy Clark from Chicago... and we went to this really classy spa for the weekend. It was a great place. But it turned out that Clark's idea of a great weekend was a little like, boot camp. [GIGGLING] [PIANO MUSIC PLAYING] Can you turn over? SHERI: I think I need a massage. I still have fantasies about it. Did that ever happen to you, Veronica? Maybe. You know what my fantasy is? What? After I moved here, I saw my first motorcycle carp at a stop light. They did not cops like this, like in Bucharest. We're talking, a perfect tan, big cleft chin, mirror shades. Boots, tight pants. Anyway, he looks through my window and looks we over real long. Then he starts writing out a ticket. But he starts licking his lips like this... [ALL LAUGHING MISCHIEVOUSLY] So, he hands me the note. And guess what it says? His phone number. This is my fantasy. It says, unlock the back door. [LAUGHING] And all those cars are whipping past us. And I'm on top of him, and it's yeah, yeah, yeah! It's fucking amazing! [CHEERING] Well, I can top all of you. And this one really happened. Mine really happened. You paid for yours. This was like destiny. Tedra, I didn't know you believed in destiny. The way this guy made me feel... I'd believe in Martians, if he asked me to. I doubt it. What? I'm just saying you don't have the most open mind when it comes to mystical things. Excuse me. There's a difference between open-minded and deluded. Okay, well, let's hear your tale of carnal bliss. Okay. This may sound strange. But I thought I'd forgotten all about this night. Until now. WOMAN: They tend to blend together after a while. You probably won't believe this. Remember when my car broke down in New York? You never told me you got lucky over there. This wasn't luck. It was destiny! We know. Anyway, when you went to hitchhike to get help, it was only me and Veronica left in the car. When you didn't return for two hours, I got worried. So we started jogging back by that little town we passed, you know, the one with the nasty restrooms? Anyway, about a mile down the road... completely out of nowhere, this man ran right by me. What did he look like? He had brown hair, green eyes, and not an ounce of fat. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] TEDRA: He knew I was there, but he wouldn't acknowledge me. And he sure wasn't going to let me catch him. [LAUGHS] WOMAN: That must have driven you crazy. TEDRA: Shut up! Anyway... He veered off the road, and onto this little horse trail I guess it was. He said the trail was a shortcut into town if I could stay with him. [PANTING] Three weeks before our trip I ran that tri-state triathlon. I'm telling you, I was in the shape of my life. But this guy's stamina was amazing! He could have gone all night. SHERI: I'm sure that's just what you were thinking. [ALL LAUGHING] [MUSIC CONTINUES] I kept thinking... What if this guy's some psycho killer? But somehow I knew he wasn't. WOMAN: You're telling me you followed him into the shack? [SHRIEKS] I've never been so scared in my life. What happened? Well... Then my heart started beating again. I felt his other hand touch me. Only this time... The fear was gone. Totally erased. I just stood there. He kept touching me. Touching me. Anyway... The next couple hours were pretty hazy. I couldn't see him. I couldn't see anything. But I could sure as hell... Are you all right? Oh. [LAUGHS NERVOUSLY] Yeah. You look like you just saw a ghost. I'm fine, really. So, what happened? Multiple orgasms. First time ever. Now I really know how to fake 'em. You are not going to believe this. But I had some of the best sex of my life that night, too. Only, it wasn't with a man. WOMAN: What? TEDRA: Please tell me it was with a donkey. [LAUGHING] This is so strange. Why haven't we ever talked about this before? It's a long, crazy story, how I got there. And I can only remember bits and pieces. But somehow, I ended up inside the weirdest mansion... that you could ever imagine. Here I am on the run with this poor girl whose life I just saved. The girl pulled me towards the bed. And she knew exactly what she wanted. TEDRA: My God, this is going to be a lesbo story, isn't it? [GIGGLING] I told her that this wasn't the right time or the right place, but something told me that it was. I can't explain it. TEDRA: Think I'm going to puke. I think not seeing that it was another woman made it easier. There was something about the way that she touched me. Like she was clairvoyant. All the secret things that I'd ever fantasized about. All the secrets that you dare not tell anybody, let alone ever act them out. [SIGHING] Everything that she did to me, and everything that happened that night... were right out of the safe that I keep locked up in the back of my mind. [VERONICA GASPING] Oh my God! Oh my God! Quick, get me some help. Hurry! It's okay. It's okay, honey. Jesus Christ, is she dying? Hold her down, hold her down! It's okay, it's okay. It's okay. You're all right. Just take deep breaths. Deep breaths. Just relax. What happened? I don't know. All of a sudden, she just started going into convulsions. Well let's get her out. Yes. Now. You came back. SHERI: [PANTING] Okay. Oh my God, she's burning up. [PANTING] Okay. What do you think it is? Is she going to be all right? JOSH: I don't know. I'm going to call a doctor. Wait. [BREATHING HEAVILY] I'm fine. I'm fine. Come on, give her some room. Back off. I'm going to call him. Okay. What happened in there? The stories that you and Tedra told, it's not really what happened. At least I don't think it is. What are you saying, we're lying? No, no. Something else happened. It doesn't all quite make sense to me, but... For the last couple of days I've been having these... Uh, bizarre flashes of things that happened that night. And they're so vivid. I mean it's like, there's no way that I'm just imagining them. Coming from someone that believes in UFOs and ghosts, you'll have to understand my skepticism. Wait a minute, wait a minute. Parts of that night are a complete blur for me, too. Go on. Remember a couple of minutes before the car stalled? I told you that I saw those strange lights in the fog. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [SIGHING IN EXHAUSTION] I think we're lost. Not just lost. We're in the damn twilight zone. I can't even figure out what country we're in. It's up here somewhere. What's the matter, Ronnie? Hello! I saw those lights again. [TEDRA GIGGLING] You and your stupid lights. Why don't you make yourself useful and figure out this retarded map? I need the flashlight. While you're at it, can you figure out what town that was that we passed a couple of miles back, please? It looks like we're still on the M6, which means there must be another town just ahead. Oh, this is weird. SHERI: Shit! Great, some prick wants to play chicken. Get the hell out of the way! [HORN TOOTING] [HORN TOOTING] [TIRES SKIDDING] VERONICA: What the hell was that? Why did you turn on the air conditioner? I didn't. I don't believe this, we're out of gas. What? You know, those are those same lights I saw before, except... they were over there, above the horizon. You know, I think that was a UFO. How could we be out of gas? We filled up this tank an hour ago and it cost us a fortune. Did you hear what I said? I said I think that was a UFO. Yeah, right. Ronnie, maybe it was just a big rig of something. Don't you get it? They've been following us. They've been watching us. They've been trying to make contact. The only thing you need to make contact with, is a vibrator. [LAUGHS] Listen, I'm going to try and hit town. SHERI: The driver was a local veterinarian. I was wondering if I could get a lift into town? He told me that he could give me a lift to the next service station. Thanks. But he had to make an emergency stop along the way. TEDRA: This is before you went to bed with that girl? Oh yeah, way before. The wildest night of my life was just beginning. You know, I'm planning on being a veterinarian myself. I've got a couple of applications at two graduate schools right now. I don't know how it is out here but... back in the States, it's absolutely inhumane when they treat animals. So, have you lived here long? I've only recently arrived. How long does it take for you to set up your practice? Truthfully, this is only my first professional visit. I'm somewhat nervous. If you don't mind, I was planning to stop for a quick drink. Hey, whatever it takes. I just need a lift into town. The sooner I can get that gas and get back to my car, the better. My girlfriends are probably really worried about me right now. I don't remember what he said. But whatever it was, I didn't feel that urgency anymore. I knew you guys were okay. And the place he was stopping, it wasn't exactly in town. Come to think of it... I have no idea where it was. [CARNIVAL MUSIC PLAYING] Wow! What will it be, partner? Whiskey, straight up, for me. And for the lady? I'll have a rum and coke. Coke? Uh, beer is fine. Beer. Better. This place is amazing. I have always fantasized about living in the old west. I mean... I love horses. I think they are the most beautiful creatures in the whole world. Here you are. [SHERI LAUGHS] You're going to do great. I know you are. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] It was too strange. I was basically watching a girl be served up in an orgy. It was purely physical. But she seemed to enjoy it. Next thing I remember, we were pulling up to this incredible mansion. We were supposed to be making a house call. He said he needed my help. What country were you in? Sounds like Mars to me. [HORSE NEIGHING] Hi. Oh, he's so beautiful. [LAUGHING WHIMSICALLY] [EERIE MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC SHIFTS TEMPO] He said that if I was going to assist him, we both had to sterilize ourselves for the protection of the patient. TEDRA: And you believed him? WOMAN: How do you sterilize yourself in a barn? He said the problem wasn't dirt or mud or even the hay on the floor. See, all these things were in the creature's natural environment. What we had to cleanse ourselves from was the human's toxins that we brought back from the city. He told me that the problem with our patient was modern civilization. It was a rare condition of an animal that was pure in its nature, but... that had been contaminated by the worst aspects of modern civilization. WOMAN: This is getting stranger by the minute. Yeah. But there was something very non-threatening about him. And I really did wanna help. I was so worked up, I could barely stand it. The only thing that kept me from throwing myself at him was that painting. The eyes. They were so intense. Like they were jealous. And they were watching me. VERONICA: That wasn't a painting. That was me. I saw you with him. Nothing happened. Not between you and the vet, anyway. He was saving you for someone else. You better lay back down, Veronica. You're delirious. No wait, she's right. Nothing did happen between me and him. But how could you possibly know that? Hey, am I interrupting something? We were just telling campfire stories. I just called a doctor. Friend of mine. Just to be on the safe side. Every once in a while, someone faints in the steam room. I'm sure it's nothing to worry about, but my friend thinks you might me anemic. I don't think so. I just saw my doctor before I went to Europe. Hey, are you qualified to take a blood sample? It's just a little prick on the end of your finger. It's used for cholesterol checks. You're gonna bleed just a few drops, but it's enough for him to check it out. Is that okay? Yeah. Ew! So, does anemia affect the brain? Because our girl here has been spouting some real science fiction. I'm telling you, I was there, I saw what happened to both of you. Okay, I'm dying to hear. Where exactly was it that we were, and how did you get front row seats? It's hard to say exactly. No, it's not. You were in the car for at least two hours after Sheri left. I know, but... Listen... I'll just go ahead and pass this onto my buddy. He's going to swing by on his way to the hospital tonight. If you leave me your name and number, I'll have him contact you with the results. Thanks, appreciate it. Sounded like a majorly come on to me. Now you're dreaming. He's probably just worried about a lawsuit. I am not dreaming! Chill out, Ronnie, all we're saying is... Something else happened that night. I'm positive. It happened to all of us. Right after I saw those lights. You wanna know what happened? I'll tell you what happened. Gory details and all. What, you mean after I left? Precisely. What a bunch of junk. How long has Sheri been gone now? I swear, when's your birthday? 'Cause I'm gonna buy you a watch. Almost two hours. Can I see the flashlight again? Thanks. Those lights are back, but there's only three of them now. Okay, that's it. I cannot stay in this car one more second with you and your fucking adolescent imagination. Where are you going? I'm gonna jog back to that little tourist trap we passed. Tedra, wait! That town was at least five miles back. It'll take me half an hour. Wanna bet I'll be back with help before Sheri does? It's gonna be pitch dark, you know? That's why I'm taking the flashlight. Better lock the doors. Just in case you weren't imagining those stupid lights. [PANTING] Like I said, about a mile down the road, this guy came jogging up next to me, and I followed him into this empty house in the woods. [SHRIEKS] [GASPING] WOMAN: I still can't believe this part. I have seen too many horror movies. TEDRA: It wasn't like that. While he was touching me, in the dark, I could start to see things. WOMAN: That's all he did was touch you? Of course not. I think he was kissing me all over. But that's not what I remember. I remember seeing these moments from my past. Things I've never forgotten. I don't get myself off very much. And I'm not like some people who would do it in a public place. But every once in a while, [LAUGHING SHEEPISHLY] I'll have some wine and just do it. And every time I do, in my mind, I'm seeing one of these moments. [HEAVY BREATHING] I was a sophomore back in high school. It was my first time. Stop, I think someone's watching us! Then I saw this other time in my parent's pool house. We had this foreign exchange student living with us from Italy. I couldn't believe we were doing it. My parents were right outside by the pool. Oh my God, is someone watching us? There is another time, after a frat party at state. [MOANING] They said there wasn't anyone else in the house, but I kept hearing all this whispering. Fuckers, is someone looking at me? Only there I was, back with the runner, back in the house. [MOANING] It was all so surreal. In a moment, my mind just drifting off... I'm having the same super kinky dream I remember having once a long time ago. I thought you were muff-diving with some half-horsed dyke. No. I mean about having a dream during sex. And how surreal it was, as I was lying there in bed, I saw the same painting I had seen in the stables. I could swear it wasn't there before. WOMAN: Wait a second, what happened with the vet, and the orange soap and the big emergency and all that stuff? Oh yeah, right. I don't embarrass very easily, but I shrink like a little girl when that cold water hit me. He didn't even flinch. It was like this Zen thing with him. It was extremely sexy. TEDRA: So Veronica was right? Nothing happened at all with Mr. Zen? Part of me wanted him in the worst way. A part of me knew it wasn't the right thing. The vet and the owner of this mansion were trying to figure out what to do. I could only hear bits and pieces. But they were talking about some kind of infection from the city. And if she couldn't be cured she'd have to be destroyed. They said she was dangerous to the whole community. I assumed they were talking about a horse. WOMAN: You're telling us this girl was wearing a saddle? The vet explained to me that the girl was a maid in the mansion. And that he and the people of the county considered her a nymphomaniac. They said her wild ways were a result of her having come from the city. They had tried to treat her by wrapping her in animal skins to turn her back to nature. Where do you come up with this shit? How can anyone have the right to torture some poor girl just because he caught her with his two sons? I'm sure no one put a gun to their heads. Hey! It's just a story. Is it? I tell you something private I did a long time ago when I was drunk. And now suddenly you have a story about a girl who slept with two guys? I'm just trying to tell you about what I remember that night. I mean... [SIGHS WEARILY] maybe your story did remind me about it a little bit. But I don't think it has anything to do with you. That's for sure. Because I'm not a lesbian. Please, Sheri. Finish your story. The vet asked me to talk to the girl and to convince her that this tranquilizer was for her best. Get back! Get back! WOMAN: Best for who? Best for her. Don't you understand? They're going to lobotomize her. Take away her free will. And I was supposed to give her the anesthesia! TEDRA: Mother Teresa again. These people are fucking psychotic! SHERI: Hey! I am right there with you! As we were leaving, the vet told me that he'd read me correctly. That he had brought me along for this very purpose. To do what he couldn't. To give this poor girl what she needed. [GUN SHOTS] I've always fantasized about saving someone, or something. Not because I crave their gratitude, but because it genuinely turns me on. I mean, it really turns me on to think of myself as a savior. It sounds pretty stupid I know, but... seeing myself that way, I feel so sexy, so confident. It is this amazing high. I wanted to save them all. But, I knew it was too late. There should have been nothing that could pull me away from the feeling of that moment. Something in that painting did. I saw this collision of reality and fantasy, where all my dreams reached their climax, intertwining with one another, in this kind of... montage. Watching that painting, watching myself, I had this epiphany, where my true desire became... crystal clear. I desired those who needed me, and those I needed equally. Male or female, the sex was completely irrelevant. It finally occurred to me that... gratification was a gift... ...to be cherished and shared. How did you know that? Because I realized the same thing in my dream. I mean, word for word. As if somebody typed it into my brain. That's what we all learned. That's what he learned, too. Don't even tell me you got laid that night, too. So wait, Tedra, what is your story? You never finished. You just said it to us, super kinky. Well, before we get into that, can we get out of here? I mean, I need to take a dip. I dunno, I mean it's up to you, Ronnie. You feeling back to normal yet? I know what your dream was, Tedra. Yeah, right. You wanna hear it? What is this, a joke? You open your eyes, and you find yourself in the middle of what seems to be... a big arena. How could she know that? Damn it, Veronica. How could you possibly know that? There's a scoreboard high above you, thousands of screaming fans beneath you. some of them reaching up to touch you. A man comes into the arena with you. You know him as the runner. A loud buzzer sounds, and the game begins. And then you're presented a trophy. And you hold it high proudly. As beneath you, your adoring fans reach out to touch you. Then I look down, at this man I've just beaten. Still laying there. Naked. Totally exhausted. And I get this... overwhelming feeling of guilt. I mean, here's this guy... has made me feel like I've never felt before my whole life. Not even close. And he's the loser. Seeing that look in his eyes I realize. Those were my eyes. Every time before. In high school. In college. Someone always took something from me. And I was the loser. So I gave him the trophy. 'Cause like you said, it just suddenly occurred to me... that gratification is a gift to be cherished and shared. I just have to say, this is the strangest day of my life. If I 'm ever in Europe, and I ran out of gas, I'm locking myself in the trunk. [LAUGHING] Ronnie, how could you possibly know what happened in Tedra's dream? Like I told you. I was there. You were in my mind? No, but... your mind was on display. I think we just had carbon monoxide poisoning. It's the only way we could explain this. I can explain it. I can explain all of it. Every minute, more and more is coming back to me. Didn't you both notice that when you were telling your stories, how... certain details just kind of... appeared in your mind, like... like you were seeing them for the first time? Everybody took home a reality they could handle. He didn't want to overload us with more than we could bear. Who's he? He was... an alien. [SIGHS IN EXASPERATION] Do you have any idea how this sounds? Yeah, it sounds like a fantasy. Sure as hell not reality. Do you remember this ring? You remembered it as a bar of soap. You rationalized it to fit neatly into your memory. I never saw that ring before in my life. Yes, you have. Do you remember the trophy? VERONICA: You tried to take his ring before he offered it to me. But you gave it back for whatever reason. VERONICA: I know it sounds impossible. But all those places that... you thought you saw, the abandoned house, the mansion, the saloon, they were, all just in your mind. All of it? No. Not all of it. I was gonna say, I'm absolutely positive I was sore the next day. The sex was real, definitely. But not the way you remember it. I don't know what I remember. Do you remember when I said that I saw the lights? That's when it all started. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] I think both of you had fainted. Seconds later, there was this incredibly bright flash. And then we weren't in your car anymore. I don't know why I didn't faint. I know I was scared, but... all those lights just didn't have the same effect on me. Maybe this was something I'd subconsciously always been waiting for. SHERI: What did it look like inside? Like everything you could imagine, and nothing you would expect. ALIEN: Please. None of you will be harmed physically or emotionally. I am a lone survivor of a distant planet not unlike your own. I have already studied the male form, and altered myself genetically to achieve compatibility. In this way, I hope to understand your reproductive process. If my species is to survive, I must rely on humans. VERONICA: Somehow, images and memories from our minds... were projected onto a big screen. He opened a door into our fantasies. I stood there, perfectly motionless, watching on the screen as your fantasies played themselves out. VERONICA: Every little thing he did to you, every touch, every breath, changed the way your fantasy played out. He was trying to evoke your desire, trying to discover what turned you on. This is a bunch of shit. Now of that ever happened to me. He scanned you. Just like he scanned Sheri. He opened the door, and he entered your mind. [PANTING] When it came to me, I saw my fantasy actually playing itself out. Not on the screen, but... in real life. I had made contact, with intelligent life from another planet. I was actually inside a spaceship. When he saw that he was part of my fantasy, that he was desired, I think, he felt desired for the first time. I think he finally discovered what it's like to be human. He returned us to the car the next morning. Car started right up, since we never really had one out of gas. Both of you believed that we'd gone to town and gotten help. We finished our trip and never said another word about that night. I don't even think I remembered my fantasy until just now. Parts of it maybe, but... not the sex. That's funny. I remember the sex but nothing else. [GIGGLING] Okay. So let me get this straight. Are you saying that Veronica's story is true? I don't know. I don't believe this. You guys were abducted by an alien, and had an orgy up in his ship? I mean, it was a great story. But please. You know what? It doesn't even matter if it's true or not. It's Ronnie's fantasy. You got that right, girl. You've got one hell of an imagination. [SHERI LAUGHING] That's exactly what he said. Hold on a second. Here she is. Veronica. Yes? It's the doctor, he wants to talk to you. Okay. Yes? I see. Thanks. Ronnie? Honey, are you okay? So what did the doctor say? Are you anemic or what? Uh, anemic? No. So? What did he say? I'll tell you the next time we get together. Okay.
