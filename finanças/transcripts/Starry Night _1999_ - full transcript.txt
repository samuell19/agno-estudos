A little voice inside told me you were hungry. My soul is starved for perfection, margot, not food. Starved for a kind word or two... From a world that hates me, a world that would love to see my work burned if it could. It's not your time, vincent. The world hasn't woken up to you. My time... Will never come. Perhaps it will. Listen to this, and look at that. Critics-- the way they attack me and lash out at me, like a coiled snake with poison venom! I'll listen later. I've prepared something special to warm the cockles of your heart. What is it? Eat. I'll answer your questions later. Better I should starve and end my torment. But it does smell good. Just a little. It is good! What is it? It's a special brew for you, my friend. Potato potion. A potion? A brew? Some sort of witchcraft? A family secret. Gaze into the bowl. What do you see? I see... Flowers. Many kinds of flowers. [ Margot ] you will become the greatest painter of flowers who ever lived, and one day, the flowers will return your love. How will the flowers do that? After your body lies dead and still in the cold ground... For more than a century, the flowers will summon you back among the living. - but only for 100 days. - why only 100 days? That will be time enough for you to set right... All the things that have gone wrong in your life... This time. And then, vincent, you will be able to rest in peace. *Starry, Starry Night *Paint Your Palette Blue and gray * *Look Out On A Summer's Day *With Eyes That Know The darkness in my soul * *Shadows On The Hills *Sketch The Trees And the daffodils * *Catch The Breeze And the winter chills * *In Colors On the snowy, linen land * *Now I Understand *What You Tried To Say To Me *And How You Suffered For your sanity * *And How You Tried To set them free * *They Would Not Listen They did not know how * *Perhaps They'll Listen Now *Starry, Starry Night *Flaming Flowers That brightly blaze * *Swirling Clouds In violet haze * *Reflect In Vincent's Eyes Of china blue * *Colors Changing Hue *Morning Fields Of amber grain * *Weathered Faces Lined in pain * *Are Soothed Beneath The artist's loving hand * *Now I Understand *What You Tried To say to me * *And How You Suffered For your sanity * *And How You Tried To set them free * *They Would Not Listen They did not know how * *Perhaps They'll Listen Now *For They Could Not Love You *But Still Your Love Was true * *And When No Hope Was left inside * *On That Starry, Starry Night * *You Took Your Life As lovers often do * *But I Could Have Told you, vincent * *This World Was Never Meant For one as * *Beautiful As You [ Children chattering ] [ Church bell tolling ] [ Bell continues tolling ] [ Man ] What a day, and what a way to bring in the new year. This is the biggest tournament of roses parade yet. Each of the 102 floats is a complex work... Of mechanical wizardry and computer control. * [ Marching Band Continues ] Today, as millions of people watch and tens of thousands are here in pasadena, the tournament is celebrating the theme of vincent van gogh... And his great paintings of flowers. Van gogh painted all types of flowers, but his sunflowers, perhaps, are among the most popular in the world. Although he died penniless, today his paintings are worth hundreds millions of dollars, and he's honored as an artistic genius. Like so many great artists, in his own time van gogh was completely rejected. People simply didn't understand his paintings. - [ Man shouting ] - [ Woman ] Oh, my god. [ Screams ] [ Announcer ] Just a moment. There's some sort of emergency down on the parade route. Oh, the parade has stopped. Apparently, someone has been struck by one of the floats. It's a man. We don't know the extent of his injuries. We're being told he was dressed as-- [ Chuckles ] As vincent van gogh. There's some confusion as to whether or not he was part of that float. We'll keep you up to date on that story as it develops. Hello! Have you had an accident and it wasn't your fault? Maybe you've been getting hit from all sides... And think there's nowhere to turn to for help. Well, relief is here. Call me, gabe burton, attorney at law, because I want to give you what's coming to you, and I'll give them back what's coming to them. So, call ME: Hey, honey. Honey, honey, honey! My ad's on tv! Ah! This is gonna change everything! I'm back in business again! Honey, I'm trying to video our new year's day party, and you're blocking the view! [ Wife ] oh, I'm blocking the view? Get down from there before you break your leg! Come on, honey. Don't you think that I've learned my lesson? - move out of the way. - move out of the way? Get off the ladder! Get off the ladder, gabe. Get off the ladder! No, no, no, no-- - don't shake the ladder! - oh, gabe, not again! Call 9-1-1. Hey, buddy, I've been thinking. Maybe you should sue those rose parade people. I-i-i'm used to handling personal injury cases. I could be your attorney. The brakes didn't work on that float that hit you, and so you became the only person in history... To be run over at the rose parade on live national television. You suffered physical injury and emotional distress. [ Chuckles ] Oh, ho, ho, boy! That's a two-million-dollar out-of-court settlement if I ever heard one! So, what do you think, buddy? What are you looking at? This painting! It's starry night! - but there's no paint. - well, of course not. That's a color print. - color engraving? - no, no. You know, a-a-a-- a print! They take these famous pictures and reproduce zillions of 'em. But the entire effect has been destroyed. I intended this to have thick colors and textures. What do you mean, yo intended? Vincent van gogh painted starry night. Yes. Of course. Let me see how you're coming with my, uh, face. Oh, that's not bad. Not bad! Y-y-you got some great talent there. You think? How much you want for this? [ Chuckles ] I don't know. A hundred bucks? - a hundred bucks? - you drive a hard bargain. Two hundred bucks, take it or leave it. I'll take it. Thank you. Two hundred bucks. You must have told me before, but I, uh-- what is your name? Gabe. Gabe burton. Burton. I am vincent. And yours? Nice to meet you, vincent. Nice to meet you, gabe. How much is this worth in guilders? Guilders. I don't know. [ Chuckles ] - francs? - about 1,100 francs, give or take. No! 1,100? You are too generous, gabe. I should paint your portrait for this much money. - in oils? - in oils, yes. You'd have to pose for me, of course. All right! You're not bad, vincent. Give me a buzz when we get out of here, and we'll touch base. I will give you buzz... And will touch the base. "Gabe burton, attorney at law." To think I only got 400 francs when I sold my first painting to anna boch. Hundreds of beautiful paintings I made in a five-year period, and nobody was interested in one of them, not one. And now, look. I seem to be famous and hanging on people's walls. And they make prints of my work! Hey, wait a minute there. Where are you going? You need to sign this book out. Oh, I beg your pardon. - right there. - right there. And there you go. Thank you. Vincent van gogh? Thank you. - that's right. - I am not in the mood for jokes. Oh, it's no joke. Now, may I go? Please, sign your real name! Gabe, let me show you something I found in this good book. Here. Here there's a picture of me. An excellent likeness, don't you think? Spittin' image. Except that's a picture of vincent van gogh. Yes, it is. That's what I'm saying. I am vincent van gogh. - oh, boy. - my dear friend paul gauguin painted this of me. - nurse! - [ Telephone ringing ] Well, well. I hear you two youngsters were up early this morning terrorizing the nursing staff. Glad you're feelin' better. Got to look at your, uh, bandage here first. I don't see why I need it. Well, you have a very serious injury. How serious? The lobe of your left ear was completely severed. No. Yes, it was. No, it wasn't. No, it wasn't. Yes, it was. I cut if off myself a long time ago. [ Snoring ] [ Sighing ] [ Sneezes ] [ Wind gusting ] [ Traffic passing, horn blowing ] [ Woman ] Let's just forget about it, all right? Oh, come on, kathy. Will you grow up? [ Sighs ] Now, why can't you just get over your crazy obsession? Obsession? Is that what you think this is? Yeah. And have a real life here with me. I have a life, chuck. Oh, you wanna waste your life living for your art. You can be so insensitive! That's the reason we're breaking up, chuck. No, I am not insensitive. I am just practical in my approach to life. I wanna make a wish. [ Thinking ] I want to be appreciated as an artist and a woman... And I want to know love. What was your wish? - what was your wish? - you wouldn't understand. [ Laughing ] so, chuck wants me to go to the park city film festival with him. God, I thought you two broke up. Oh, we did. But, you know, we're still just friends. You know, I can see it NOW: He'll say okay, we show up at the hotel, and suddenly... There's one room left, with a double bed. [ Laughs ] yup. So, sha-- ow, my foot! Oh, stop! - somebody help. My foot! - give it back. Ow, stop! [ All clamoring, robber growling ] Are you all right? Yeah, I'm fine. I'll probably have some bruises to remind me are you all right? Yes, yes. That was a mean and destructive human soul. Thank you. You're welcome. Hardly fit for human society. [ Panting ] May I escort you home? Oh, no, thanks. We just live right over there. The building with the billboard. But we're not going home right now. [ Vincent ] right there? Yes. You know, I don't have much money, but please, let me give you a reward. No, no. I won't hear of it. It's enough to know that I've helped you. That's reward enough for me. Well, thank you. Thank you very much. Are you okay? Thanks. I am. Thanks. God, I can't believe it. Did you see that guy? He had tattoos all the way-- he did. Oh, god. I would still like to help you sue the rose parade. In fact, I'll even waive my retainer, since you're so flat broke. Unless, of course, you're still cashing in from some of these, uh, van gogh paintings, huh? Boy, you know, it's too bad that, uh-- that some of this money isn't going into your pocket. What are my paintings selling for these days, gabe? Uh, van gogh's sunflowers sold to a japanese insurance company for 33. Thirty-three dollars? Not bad. Thirty-three millio dollars. - that's impossible! - oh, you wanna bet? And that was just a low-ball price. Irises went to alan bond of australia... In 1987, for 54! - fifty-four... Million? - well, of course, million. And, uh, portrait of uh, doctor "gachette"-- "gash-ay." Doctor gachet. Portrait of Dr. "Gash-ay" Sold for 78... To some japanese collector. Oh, and look at THIS: Alex manners just paid 65 million bucks... For self-portrait at "auvairs." "Au-vair." Self-portrait at auvers. I don't understand. If my paintings are worth so much, why am I so broke? - it's not fair. - ahh! Who said life was fair? That's so much money I could do good things with, gabe. There's many worthy causes out there. Yeah, well, keep dreaming, kid. I'm sure the, uh, "check is in the mail." Where does that collector live That one that just bought my self-portrait? Crescent drive, in beverly hills. [ Chattering, women laughing ] [ Electronic alarm chirping ] Alex. Alex! Don't shoot! You might put a hole in the painting. That's not bad. I mean, it's fantastic, actually. - thank you for saying so. - I really like your style. You seem to really know how to let yourself go. How are you doing after that terrible attack? I'm fine. Thanks. I'm sorry. - I forgot to ask your name. - kathy. And you're-- I'm vincent. Vincent. Hi. Well, you're quite an artist, vincent. Thanks again for saying so. Uh, do you think that we could be friends? What do you mean, "friends"? Friends that talk to each other and say what they think. [ Sighs ] Think about what? About EVERYTHING: Life, creation, destiny, fate, wisdom-- [ Chuckling ] - that's a start, isn't it? - [ Sighs ] Are you always so serious? - it's one of my faults. - hmm. Wh-- yes. Yes, we can be friends. So, uh-- did you move into the building? Uh, I live up on the roof. - how can you live on the roof? - it's not that bad, and it has a great view. - well, see you. - see you. How do you do, Mr. Manners? At the moment, not too well, thank you. This is where my van gogh was stolen from. Well, I'm detective brook murphy, art theft detail. I was up all night with the police, dusting for fingerprints. Thank you for following up so quickly. It's my job. What are my chances for getting it back? - slim to none? - I don't have a crystal ball, Mr. Manners. - you must know the odds. - art crimes accounted for two billion in losses last year, only a fraction of which was recovered. A fraction? A fraction. Two billion in losses? Two billion. Right behind drug trafficking. I don't suppose you've ever gone after a van gogh before, have you? Is that what you suppose, Mr. Manners? I was the one who nailed losey-- the con man who stole the renoir from the LA. County museum of art. - you're the one who arrested losey? - yes. I have spent ten years in this business, Mr. Manners. I have had over 350 cases, ranging from... Stolen greek statuary to solid gold hara-kiri knives... With sculpted handles by yoko ono. - mind if I look around? - be my guest. - times have changed, aunt gladys. - yes, they have. [ Sighs ] People are more independent these days. They have to be in order to survive. I don't understand you '90s women. Why is it so wrong to fall in love and have a normal, happy marriage? [ Sighs deeply ] Don't get me wrong. I would love to meet the right man. If that happens, that would be just fine with me. It'll happen if you let it happen. But it is not at the top of my agenda right now. Being established as an artist is. Why is it so many people are worried about their agenda these days, instead of having a happy life? [ Man on tv ] ...With what's known as an art terrorist, possibly even a renegade KG.B. Agent... Who's trying to undermine the economy of the western world. [ Male host ] Once again, for those viewers just joining us, detective brook murphy is on the prowl. Her number one target, the thief who stole van gogh's self-portrait at auvers. Isn't it true that most art thieves turn out to be con men? [ Murphy ] Well, that's just a stereotype. Your suave con man who has a french accent, drives a rolls-royce... And lives in a classy penthouse? - and it's not true. - sometimes. More often than not, it's your frustrated artist, your talented wanna-be who couldn't quite make a name for himself. So, instead of creating art, he steals it instead. [ Women chattering ] Huh! He's up there every day now. [ Other woman ] You told him you live here, and now he's stalking you. Wanna bet? Then you're naive. He is not. Wonder what he's painting. The hat makes the man. [ Siren wailing ] * [ Blues ] [ No audible dialogue ] Yeah, we found the van gogh this morning in the guardhouse. - guardhouse? - yes. In a plain box, wrapped up in brown wrapping paper. That's the most bizarre thing I've heard since... That 61-year-old truck driver stole a goya from the national gallery in london... And then got scared and left it in brown wrapping paper at the railroad station. There's something even stranger about this case. Oh, my god! It's one of the worst cases of vandalism I've ever seen. It's a tragedy! This is the note the thief left. "Dear sirs, I never sold this self-portrait... "During my natural lifetime, therefore, as the artist, it belongs to me. "I've corrected a serious flaw. "It needed a yellow hat to make it cheerful. "I don't approve of my art being hoarded by private collectors. "I painted not just for the rich but for everyone who loves beauty. "Therefore I am proud to donate this work to your museum. - sincerely, vincent van gogh." - sheer lunacy. Maybe not. [ Scoffs ] How could it be anything else? Tell me. Might be a political statement. I fail to see the politics in it, frankly. There are organized groups in the third world. We call them "art terrorists." They're determined to undermine the stability of the international art market. They thrive on creating economic chaos. I think maybe he's one of them. [ Knocking on door ] [ Kathy ] Who is it? [ Knocking continues ] Yes? [ Vincent ] It's me. You said we could be friends. Remember? Hello. Could we have that talk now? Are you busy? Oh! Uh, no. I-i-it's okay. Come in. What's that? Wine? Uh, no. It's the wormwood. What? Absinthe. Oh. Doesn't that taste sort of medicinal? [ Gags ] It's good medicine for the soul. Try some? Oh! Uh, no. Thank you, though. Please. I'm very embarrassed to tell you this, but I've forgotten your name, which is just so stupid, because you practically saved my life the other day. That's all right. I'm vincent. Vincent! Right! Kathy. Kathy. [ Chuckles ] Thank you again. Please. Please. Thank you. [ Sighs ] It's nice to have somebody to talk to. I've been lonely before. I used to have many friends I could talk to. Wonderful friends. But they're all dead and gone. Tell me about you. You live here all alone? Uh, well, yes. Actually, my parents died a few years ago, and I've been here on my own ever since I started taking art class. So, you're an art student, then? Yes. Uh, but to tell you the truth, I don't know how much longer I'll be able to keep going. My paintings aren't selling, and I really thought they would have by now. But I guess that's the case with my other friends at school. I'd like to meet your other friends. Well, okay. Maybe you could come to, uh, class, you know, sometime. I'd love to do that. The thighs are too small. What? The thighs. They surround the female nectar. They need more flesh. And why don't you show the fullness of her breasts? Because. This is how I see her, vincent. But you hide her flaws. You should make every line count. - I don't want to make her look ugly. - the truth is never ugly. God made the truth. What's ugly are lies. Lies were invented by man. [ Biting apple ] Prepare yourself for a shock. - oh, my god! - sorry to be the bearer of bad news. What kind of a sick mind would do something like this? This is unspeakable! We see it all the time, Mr. Manners. Movies sensationalize it. Jack nicholson as the joker in batm defaces art, spraying graffiti all over masterpieces in a museum; the maniac who threw paint at th mona lisa in 1957. We see it all the time, Mr. Manners. Excuse me, Detective murphy. You have an urgent phone call. Excuse me. [ Perplexed sighing ] Hello. This is doctor moreau. I've made a very startling discovery. The thief's note that I have a copy of, I compared that with the handwriting of van gogh to his brother theo. Now, the note was forged to look exactly... Like the handwriting of van gogh. I mean, I have not seen a forgery this good... Since the hitler diaries. How does it feel to be homeless? I don't consider myself to be homeless. The entire world is my home, and my ceiling is god's beautiful sky! [ Chuckling ] - that's very poetic. - mm. One of yours? Yes. Don't give up painting, kathy. You have a lot of talent, but you've got to learn to stop being so stingy with your paints. Paint is like food, a nourishment for the canvas. When a baby cries, the mother offers her breast. It's the same with painting. Listen to your canvas crying. Then feed it with the paints, and don't hold back! [ Chuckles ] Seeing as you're my lawyer, I'd like to ask you for a little favor. And what's that? I'd like you to set up a trust fund in my name. A charity fund. - what kind of charity? - to help all the starving artists in the world. We'll call it "the van gogh charity fund for needy artists." [ Chuckling ] Oh, boy! That's a new one. No, it's not new at all. Why should starving artists out there... Be mocked at when everybody else in a regular profession isn't? I'd like to do something to change that. You gotta have the money in the bank before you start giving it out! I'm going to have money in the bank, gabe. A lot of it. It won't be like last time. - [ Alarm whooping ] - [ Reporter ] the van gogh bandit has struck again. Starry night was stolen from lionel caldwell's estate in beverly hills. We've been told by detective brook murphy that a $1 million reward... Is being offered for information that leads to the arrest conviction of the thief And, uh, why have you come to see me today, Miss young? Well, when I heard about the million-dollar reward, I thought to myself, "just maybe I have some information that might help." You see, I work at the hospital. [ Sighs ] I've seen my share of lost souls, but none of them have affected me as deeply as that poor man that was run over by the float You know, at the rose parade, on new year's day? And why did that touch you so deeply? Well, when I asked him to sign out the book that he wanted, he signed his name, "vincent van gogh." Here, I've got the sheet from the hospital where he signed his name vincent van gogh. Miss young, I think perhaps... Your patient may be our missing van gogh bandit. [ Gasping ] And so, the impressionists were not really a group, but, um, a collection of stubborn individualists... Who worked in obscurity... In the last half of the 19th century. People like degas, seurat, monet. Then along came the postimpressionists, uh, who leaned more toward expressionism. Renegades such as paul gauguin and vincent van gogh. Rejected by society, they attacked each other. For instance, paul gauguin... Eventually criticized and savagely attacked the work of vincent van gogh, to the extent that van gogh was never able to forgive him. Excuse me for my intrusion, professor, but that's absolutely false. I don't recognize you. Are you part of this class? I may not be a member of your class, but I have the right to defend myself... Against false accusations. [ Professor ] No one here is accusing you of anything. You just said that I never forgave paul gauguin! That's not true! I did forgive him. [ Stuttering ] Is this s-some sort of a f-fraternity prank? - it's no prank. - would you please sit down? I'm not finished. I want to say something. Paul gauguin stayed with me at arles. We were great friends. He came back from the south seas and painted many beautiful and voluptuous women and I loved him like I loved a brother. I-i-i'm sorry. I apologize, I-- [ Muttering, stammering ] I'm sorry. Let's continue. I'm sorry for this interruption. God! The way you embarrassed me in front of professor beckmore and my friends! You don't think was embarrassed, the way they spoke about me? They weren't talking about you, vincent. They were talking about a man who's been dead for over 100 years. Wa dead, kathy. Wa dead. Don't you know? Can't you see the truth? What truth? [ Breathing deeply ] I'm vincent van gogh! [ Gasps ] You can't be. I am. I was given another chance to come back to this world... To straighten up my affairs, kathy! - kathy-- - you expect me to believe this about you? You can't turn your back on a man who saved your life! Please! Give me a chance to show you who I really am. [ Sighs ] I-- come along, kathy, I want to show you all my paintings! This, the café terrace at arles, one of my old ones. And this, one of my old ones. This is one of the new ones I want to show you. Since I've come back, I've tried to create the impressions... Of the world around me, like I did the first time. Here we have hell's angels. V-room! Psh-shoo! [ Laughing ] I have more, kathy. Over this way. This is part of my Hollywood collection. It's simply titled Hollywood. Sunshine... Palm trees... The beautiful people. You can tell it's my style, can't you, kathy? Yes, it's-- it's thrilling. A-and your signature, it looks just like vincent van gogh. - I-it just says vincent. - sure. Yes. Of course. Come in. [ Sighs, laughs ] [ Sighs ] I'm sorry I committed suicide 100 years ago, kathy. Something in my soul longed to come back to finish what I started. It was the flowers that took pity on me... And gave me back life. The flowers. The flowers felt my love, and gave me the chance to blossom again, to straighten out my life. And how I messed it up last time! Kathy, wait! I want to show you. Wait. Kathy, when I was in the hospital, I had no money to pay the kind people who took care of me. So I decided to donate one of my more valuable paintings, and they can do with the money what they will. I'm hoping it will go to the poor. That' starry night! You stole it. [ Gasps ] How can I steal what's already mine, kathy? I never sold it to anyone. I never gave it away. The nights in france were so beautiful-- like this every summer night. Have you ever been? Vincent, there's a million-dollar reward on your head. They'll never let you get away with this. They will lock you up! [ Scoffs ] They won't get away with persecuting me, kathy. Are you a real person, vincent? Because sometimes I could almost believe that you're some sort of... Ghost. [ Gasps ] Is that the kiss of a ghost? Are you going to turn me in to the police? Will you? I don't know! Maybe I should! Everyone is looking for you. Don't be tempted, kathy, please? My mission is for you ! You and all of your wonderful artist friends. Won't you trust me? Won't you believe me? I have told you the truth. Vincent-- you're asking me to believe in miracles. Touch my face. Kathy. I believe you. I believ you. Thank you. Thank you. Good afternoon. Good afternoon, everyone. As you can all see, starry night has been found. - [ Reporters clamoring ] - john? - why do you think the painting was at the hospital? - no comment. Except to say-- except to say... That we have several theories on that. Are there any clues? Are there any theories who the van gogh bandit might be? As a matter of fact, there is evidence... In the form of this handwritten letter from the bandit to the hospital. This letter is obviously part of a hoax or scam. Here's what he SAYS: "I'm ashamed to say that I left the hospital... "Without ever paying my bill. "So, I would like to donate my painting, starry night, in appreciation. "Hopefully, you will sell it... "And use the proceeds to pay for medical care for the homeless. Yours sincerely, vincent van gogh." [ Clamoring ] Please, please. Detective murphy? Ladies and gentlemen of the press, please. My name is brook murphy. I am the head detective on this case, and I feel it necessary to warn you this is all very sensitive, and we're not releasing any more information at this time... Except to say that we are very relieved that starry night... Has been returned unharmed, unlike the case of self-portrait at auvers, where there was sic and perverted vandalism by a thief... Who felt it necessary to add a yellow hat in the masterpiece of vincent van gogh. - thank you very much. - [ Shouting questions ] *Now I Understand [ Chattering ] *What You Tried To say to me * *And How You Suffered For your sanity * *And How You Tried To set them free * *They Would Not Listen They did not know how * *Perhaps They'll Listen Now Kathy? I'm going to see to it that you never have to worry about having enough money... For art school ever again. I'm going to set up scholarships for you and all of your friends. And how will you do that? We'll have an exhibition, sell my new paintings. [ Scoffs ] Who's gonna believe that the new paintings are really by vincent van gogh? What if nobody wants them? And you... Never found out his real name? - I don't have a clue. - I see. You do know that he has named you as the attorney in his... "Vincent van gogh charity fund for needy artists"? Oh, well, you see, that charity doesn't exist. It's just in his fantasy. So, why did he come over to see you after you both left the hospital? Well, y-- uh-- he, uh-- oh! He-- he-- he said that he wanted to paint my portrait. So I figured, "why not?" [ Chuckles uneasily ] - I-it was free! - and you don't know where he lives? Believe me, if I thought that I could find him, I'd be on the phone to you to try to collect that reward! A million dollars! He never dropped any hints? No favorite bar? No place he likes to hang out? He's homeless. Oh! If you want to find him, search the streets. Well, that narrows it down a bit, doesn't it? Vincent, look! "Van gogh's a portrait of doctor gachet will be sold again at auction... "This afternoon in beverly hills. "Originally selling for $78 million, "art appraisers feel the price may go as high as... [ Gasps ] A hundred and twenty-five million." One hundred and twenty-five million dollars, kathy! Let me see that! This is my doctor gachet, who has come back to bless us, kathy! Kathy, I don't need a dollar for myself. I just need to be close to you. Vincent. Oh, vincent! 85, 85. Who will give me 85? I have $85 million-- 85 million, million, million, who will give me 86? - eighty-six million. Who will give me 86? - we bid $110 million. One hundred and ten million dollars. Ladies and gentlemen, this is a new world's record. Mr. Takimoto, takimoto insurance company of japan. Thank you, sir. [ Auctioneer ] A hundred and twenty million. Do I hear 125? - a hundred and twenty-five million. - one twenty-five. One twenty-five once, one twenty-five twice-- one hundred thirty million dollars. [ Auctioneer ] One hundred and thirty million dollars. I am vincent van gogh. I've come to be paid for my painting. Do you have an invitation? One hundred and fifty million dollars. One hundred and fifty million dollars. A new world's record. One hundred and fifty million dollars. A new world's record. Did you say $150 million? [ Laughs ] Ladies and gentlemen, this portrait of Dr. Gachet, which I painted over 100 years ago, is now worth $150 million! I'm ready for my payment! I'm ready for my payment! Let go! Please let go of my painting! I am ready for my payment now! Freeze, or I'll shoot! Put your hands up, or I'll shoot. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you. You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford one, an attorney will be appointed. Do you understand? Don't see the need for an attorney. I've done nothing wrong. All I've done was to take my paintings back. I'm certain we can straighten this out as gentlemen. Do you confess to stealing paintings by vincent van gogh? As I've tried to explain to you, I can't steal what's already mine. I am vincent van gogh, and my paintings belong to me, except for the ones that I gave away during my lifetime... And the one painting which I did sell. Which one van gogh painting did you sell? Yes, it was called vineyard at arles. [ Murphy ] Van gogh did sell vineyard at arles. Quite right. So far, so good. Don't disappoint me, Mr. Van gogh. When exactly did you sell it? It was at an exhibition in brussels in 1890, to a lady named anna boch... For 400 francs. Until I died, that was the only one of my paintings which I did sell. How do you explain, Mr. Van gogh, your... Amazing... Knowledge of the english language? Now, I understood that van gogh lived in holland, didn't he? Yes, in holland. And in france. And in london. That's where I learned my english. You're an excellent forger. One of the best I've ever seen - I've seen dozens. - I've never forged anything in my life. Do you confess to vandalizing van gogh's self-portrait at auvers ? Do you confess that you destroyed... A great work of art... By painting a yellow hat on it? I didn't destroy it. I finished it. I should have done it a long time ago. I think that you are one of the most cold-blooded, disrespectful, brazen art thieves... That the world has ever seen since val fierno... Stole the mona lisa in 1911. That's what I think. [ Cell door slamming ] [ Man ] Folks, it now appears... That the man claiming to be vincent van gogh is actually... Just another poor, starving artist. But isn't it intriguing to note that, if vincent van gogh actually did come back, he would quickly discover that his work had become a major cornerstone... Of the world, like gold, diamonds or... Blue chip stocks. Okay! What have we got on this vincent character? Well, the suspect was never arrested before. So, what is he, murphy? A first-time offender? Scan the hospital birth records nationwide. What period of time? Go back 50 years. No match. He's definitely not an american citizen. You have a visitor, vincent. Hi. Hi. Oh, vincent. Look at you. Don't worry about me, kathy. The coal mines in belgium were much worse than this place. They've assigned your case to judge jesse marcel. Uh-huh. And is that good news, or bad? Well, it's not good news. He's known for his stiff sentences. You're going to need $100,000 just to get out of here on bail until your trial. Boy. I wish you knew a good lawyer. [ Chortles ] Kathy! What? Kathy, I do know a good lawyer. The truth is, I should sue this vincent guy, not defend him. Because of him, I'm being harassed by the cops, and if I don't watch my step, I'm going to end up the laughingstock... Of all the yo-yos who read the national enquirer. Mr. Burton-- gabe, honey. Please. Call me gabe. Gabe. [ Chuckling ] Good. And it's kathy, not honey. Kathy? Mm-hmm. You know, there's something very mysterious about vincent. [ Chuckles ] I'm almost starting to believe in him. Well, all I know is that dead men don't retain lawyers. Undertakers, yes. Lawyers, no. Vincent thinks you're his only hope. Won't you please consider defending him? He doesn't have any money. How's he gonna pay me? I know he doesn't have any money, but I was hoping that you would just think about it. Maybe the rights to his story are worth something. You know, the van gogh bandit. I mean, he's national news right now. The only guy in history to be run over at the rose parade. It's time to put away your toys, vincent. Your attorney's here to see you. Please, can you help me? Are you gonna tell me the truth? I always tell the truth. All right. Let's start with your real name. Now, do you even know it? I'm vincent. Vincent van gogh. So, where you been for the past century, vince? - I've been dead. - oh, that's great! That's great. And is that what you want me to explain to your judge, that you've been dead? Yes! It's the truth. All right. Let me see if I got this straight. There you were, dead. And then one bright and cheery day, you decided... That you had enough of this lying around in a coffin for more than a century. So you pop up the lid and peek out. Now, your clothes are all wormy, but no sweat. You just dust 'em off, take a taxi to orly airport in paris, hop a 747 and head towards... *Hollywood Is that what happened? No, gabe, no. In a fit of anguish and pain, I gave up on life and shot myself in the chest... On july 27, 1890. And then... On the 29th... At about 1:00 in the morning, I died. [ Vincent ] It was a blessing to be out of my misery. And then, about a century later, I-- I suddenly appeared in a strange place called... Pasadena, at a parade, of all things. It was a parade of flowers-- of roses. And you know the rest. Vincent van gogh was buried at "auvairs" In france. Auvers. Auvers, "auvairs," Who cares? And his brother theo was buried right next to him. How's your story gonna hold up if they decide to ex-- [ Stammering ] Dig them up? That's it! I don't know. All I know is what I'm telling you, and I've never lied to you. You must believe me. I've never lied. All right. All right, vince. All right. All right! Okay. Okay, vince. Look. I'm not saying I believe you. But we'll play it your way. For now. "Auvairs"! Three weeks ago, a man calling himself vincent van gogh... Was arrested and jailed in Los Angeles. He was charged with stealing van gogh paintings... And then vandalizing them by changing them. Now, he claims he's just finishing his work on the paintings... That he began more than a century ago. The odds against this claim being true, of course, are astronomical. In any event, there's no way that he could prove such a claim, which leads authorities to the question, "why should anybody believe this man?" He's broke, homeless and gives every indication of being a fake... With absolutely no talent. To top it off, he's claiming to have created... Every van gogh painting in the world, and since he was never paid for them, he wants them back. All of them. That even includes the van gogh painting which is owned by... Judge jesse marcel, who is expected to give this man a very long prison term, assuming he's convicted. We are not claiming that my client didn't take the paintings, your honor. We are claiming that he acted within his legal rights. Exactly what rights are those? An artist's rights to his own work. Mr. Van gogh never sold the paintings that he took. Let me ask you this, counselor. Is your client prepared to reveal his actual name to the court, or is he gonna persist in using an alias? My client maintains that he's never used an alias, your honor. He insists that he's the dutch painter of international reputation... Vincent van gogh. - [ Snickers ] - my ears are hearing it, but my brain is having trouble integrating it. Explain yourself, please. Vincent van gogh has come back, your honor. He was never paid for his paintings, and he intends to settle accounts. [ Judge marcel ] Vincent van gogh has returned from the dead. - that's your case, counselor? - [ Mouthing words ] Um, essentially yes, your honor. I see. Join me for lunch, will you? I think we should talk this over. Just the two of us. I thought you meant you were gonna take me to le dome or the polo lounge. I'm just a poor public servant, gabe. I'm not big-time like you fat cats in the private sector. Big-time. That's a laugh. [ Pager beeping ] So what's the skinny? I'd like to see if we can uncover who your client really is. Wouldn't you? Yeah. So, what do you have in mind? Hypnosis. You wanna hypnotize him? Not me, personally. Dr. Ruby. Greatest hypnotist in the world. He studied with anna freud, sigmund's daughter. Dr. Ruby will be able to uncover whatever is buried in your client's unconscious. We'll both find out the truth. Sounds good to me. What if vincent says no? Then tell him we'll prove he's a fraud... And put him away for a long, long time. If I have to, gabe, I'll petition the french government... To dig up van gogh's bones, and I will plunk them down right on the judge's bench. [ Man ] You're floating through a thick, white cloud... That's taking you back-- back in time. Back to a day... Of deep trauma and shock. - what year is it? - 1888. You're sure it's 1888? Ja, ja, ja. The trauma you experience on that day, tell me about it. I've just cut off the lobe of my left ear. I'm bleeding to death. [ Ruby ] Why have you cut off the lobe of your left ear? [ Vincent ] I offended paul gauguin. I've pushed him out of my life. This is my penance. Penance! Now, it's another day. It's a bright, sunny summer day. I'm painting. Finishing my painting. Wheat field with crows. Outdoors. I'm going to kill myself. I'm going to shoot myself. [ Trigger cocking, gunshot ] [ Crows cawing ] [ Groaning ] You say you committed suicide in 1890, and yet you're alive today... Over 100 years later. How do you explain that? The beauty of the flowers is calling me back to life. - it's part of the spell. - tell me about the spell. I swallowed a potato potion... In 1885, given to me by a kindly peasant woman, margot. She posed for me for my painting, the potato eaters. [ Margot's voice ] After your body lies dead and still in the cold ground... For more than a century, the flowers will summon you back among the living, but only for 100 days. [ Vincent ] The flowers returned my love... And brought me back to life here. Margot said on the hundredth day... The waves and the sea would take me away. So, he's a flaming lunatic. Totally nuts from top to bottom? Okay, if that's the way you think, then stop this crusade... And let him cop to an insanity plea. That would be the biggest mistake the state of California ever made. How so? Because he's not insane. Oh! So now you admit he's not insane! Fine. What are you saying, that you disagree with Dr. Ruby's diagnosis? I'm saying I know a lot more about this case than Dr. Ruby. And there it is. Not quite as nice as my portrait of Dr. Gachet, but you'll do, and I call you portrait of officer goodman. No one's ever captured me like this before. It almost looks like a van gogh. You're not trying to get me to believe... That this man is actually the real vincent van gogh. I believe him. Well, then you've lost your mind. And you have lost your heart. [ Scoffs ] Aunt gladys, he really is who he says he is, and we have to trust him. You're asking me to believe in miracles. Of course. Don't you? - I've never seen one. - yes, you have. When the doctors told mom she couldn't have a baby, and then I came along. Wasn't that a miracle? Maybe there's room for two. Oh, kathy, I-- all right. All right. Oh-- he can have a show here in the gallery. But if the critics hate it, it comes down the next day. Oh, I love you! [ Laughing ] Do me a favor, will you? Next time you pick up a bum on the street, don't make your aim so high. Find some lunatic who thinks he's liberace. Okay. [ Male newscaster ] Almost six weeks ago... That man who calls himself vincent van gogh... Walked into an auction and created an unbelievable spectacle... That ended up with him in jail, where he is now awaiting trial. The question is, is this strange prisoner a con man... An impostor, or much worse? Well, not everyone is betting on worse. In fact, tonight from New York, we have a report... That the controversial publisher may be ready to come up with a six-figure advance For the autobiography of the man who claims to be vincent. That could mean the man would be out on bail. Gabe insisted on picking you up. We have some celebrating to do. Gabe! [ Laughing ] Oh. Thank you for getting me out of there. How can I ever repay you? I've got some ideas on that, vince baby. Now, remember, you're just out on bail until trial, so don't let it go to your head. You are hot as a pistol. I just landed a deal for your autobiography. We, uh-- we spent the six-figure advance to get you out on bail. So now you're gonna have to become a writer. A writer, gabe? I don't know about that. I wrote to my brother theo many letters, yes, but a book? Chill out. We'll get a ghostwriter from New York. They're a dime a dozen. Come on. Get in. Oh, and, vincent, I talked my aunt... Into holding an exhibition of your new paintings. She's even inviting some well-known west coast critics. Whoo-hoo-hoo, whoo-hoo-hoo! [ Gabe ] hold on to your hat, vince! Whoo! Now, see? This. It has your personality written all over it. It does. And see how nicely it goes with this jacket? Mm. Okay. Mm-hmm. Before I'm finished with you, you're going to be a fashion trendsetter. Kathy, I've decided how to thank aunt gladys for giving me my show. I'm going to make her a gift of one of my Hollywood paintings. She'll love that. Okay. Come on. Into the dressing room. In you go. In we go. I think I'll give her one of my harley-davidson hell angels paintings. I hope she likes the large ones. She can do anything with it she likes, as long as it doesn't end up in a chicken coop. Why would anybody put a painting in a chicken coop? Well, when I painted a portrait of one of my doctors-- I'm talking about Dr. Felix rey, a swine if ever I did know one-- anyway, he hated it so much, he hung it up in his chicken coop... To hide a hole in the wall! I have with me lester finley, art critic for the Los Angeles times. How are you this evening, lester? I'm fine, maria, just fine. Well, lester, what's your verdict? I wish I could be kind, maria, but critics have a responsibility to the public. I describe this exhibit in one WORD: Very disappointing. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. And, lester, why do you say that? After all the controversy over who this artist is, one thing for sure, he's not vincent van gogh. This is nothing but an amateurish attempt... To imitate post-impressionism and apply it to our modern age where it has absolutely no place. Thank you, lester. Thank you. [ Maria ] We have with us sarah centurion, critic for art world magazine. -What do you say about vincent -Juvenile in his message, maria. No interest in it in our contemporary art scene, and that is the nicest way I can say it. Well, sarah, thank you for your honesty. [ Man ] this is a charade. It's a mockery of everything tat vincent van gogh held dear So, ted, in a nutshell? This is all worthless trash. Taking a few tough punches tonight, huh, vincent? I'm used to not being liked by the critics. Maybe the jig is up; maybe youre gona find out that you can't bamboozle everybody- that there's a lot of us here who love art... And love van gogh enough to put you in your place. If that were true-- about the love-- I think you'd show me a little more respect. You don't deserve respect. You deserve to be put into prison for 30 years to life. I understand how hard it is for you to accept the fact... That I've been telling you the truth all along. You know, I don't know what it is that you want, but whatever it is-- money or fame-- you're not gonna get it. I have known a lot of painters who've turned into con men. Hell, I knew robert trotter, and I was there when we caught him red-handed and he confessed, and I saw him sweat and fall apart the same way I'm gonna see you... Get down on your knees and sweat blood. I've sweated enough, detective murphy. My work, my art is my sweat. That's the price I've paid for being who I am. That's my pain. And your pain is that you dont dare to allow yourself to believe in miracles, because if you did, that skeptical little world you live in would be destroyed Excuse me. What was your reaction to the savaging you received from the critics? Yes, well, they have their opinion, and I have mine. Do you still claim that you're the one and only vincent van gogh? Yes, of course. Believe it or not, for better or worse, I am who I am, and as an artist, I'm also my own critic. Sometimes I hate what I've done, and I paint over it. Oh. Any of these painted over? These here? No, no. But a long time ago, there was one I did called head of girl. I hated it. I painted over it. It started out as picture of a young, little blond girl with curly hair... In a bright red bonnet and a violet scarf... But it-- it looked too, uh, tsk... M-m-masculine. So I-- I took out the bonnet and painted out the rest of it, the scarf, and called it head of boy. I just saw it. Here. "Van gogh's head of boy. Owned by the morganstern family in hyannis port, Massachusetts, since 1915." Gabe, we have to go there and convince them to let us have this painting x-rayed. Whoa. Wait a minute. My expenses in this case are beginning to add up. Gabe, if the girl's scarf and bonnet show up... Under the face of the boy in an x-ray, the results could be earth-shattering. [ Kathy ] What more proof would anybody need? But, Mr. Morganstern, there is no way that an x-ray could possibly harm your painting. They do it all the time. I give you my word. He's absolutely right, sir. Do you know about the van gogh painting called winter ? A beautiful work, winter. What about it? When they x-rayed it, they found a woman at a spinning wheel underneath it. Surely if he's painted over winter, there must be others that he's painted over too. While you two were en route to come see me, I got another request about this. Do either of you by any chance know detective murphy of the LA.P.D. Art theft detail? - holy cow! - she seems convinced... That the x-ray will prove once and for all... That your vincent is a con man and a fraud, and I would like the matter settled. There it is. It's right below the surface. Painting of a young girl. It's actually there. [ Morganstern ] Quite incredible. [ Murphy ] He tricked us. How can it be a trick? Only vincent van gogh would know what he painted under there. There's got to be some logical rational explanation. Suppose van gogh wrote about this... In one of his letters to his brother theo. And suppose the impostor read it... And unfortunately we walked into his trap. All I know is there's her hat and her scarf. You can even see her curly hair. No. No. [ Male newscaster ] Head of boy. Head of girl. Scholars say van gogh never left a clue about this in any of his letters. Experts are more baffled than ever. The new vincent. Is he really van gogh? The investigation continues. It's time we went to france together, kathy. Oh. What for? To get the paintings that I hid there over a hundred years ago. What? Wha-- what paintings did you hide? Some of my very best, and they're well-hidden. It's highly unlikely that anyone has ever discovered them. [ Giggles ] Exactly where in france are they? In a crypt... Inside a church at a place called arles. Would you recognize the church if you saw it again? Since when did you become so inquisitive? All of these questions. I'm sorry, but if leonardo da vinci were alive... And he told you he had hidden some of his best paintings, you would want to know where they were too. Leonardo? I don't think so. His style is so stiff and confining. Take the mona lisa, for example. No, don't put down the mona lisa. The mona lisa is mysterious. The mona lisa is alluring. But she has none of your mystery. None of your beauty. Really? - really. - [ Laughing ] Tim magazine's gone crazy over this guy. But what if it turns out that he's a secret agent or a spy, like detective murphy's claiming? Darling, you're still focusing too much... On the issue of whether he's the original van gogh. The best minds in the art world are saying it doesn't even matter. That's absolutely right, Mr. Manners. Reality has nothing to do with it. Making a bid on his Hollywood collection... Would be a bold business decision. - I agree with 'em, dad. - hmm. You know the son of a bitch was right. The yellow hat's better. [ Kathy ] Vincent! This is for you. - what is it? A gift? - that's your passport. It cost me plenty, but if you're for real... And we find your long-lost paintings, it'll be worth every penny. [ Vincent ] Look. I recognize that face. It's me. But who is "vincent van guggenheim"? [ Gabe ] That's you, of course. That's your new identity. We can't let anybody know you're violating bail by leaving the country. Good afternoon, gladys. Oh. I came by to make an offer on vincent's Hollywood collection. Oh, well, to be honest, we just have had an offer from Mr. Takimoto here. [ Gladys ] What was that amount? It's 400,000 for all 20 paintings. I'm prepared to make it a million. [ Takimoto ] Two million. - three. - five million. - twelve. - fifteen. [ Whispering ] I bid a million a picture. Cold cash. Twenty million for the collection. Excuse me. [ Vincent ] It's been so long. [ Gabe ] How many churches can there be in arles? [ Vincent ] Did I say I hid the paintings in arles? Maybe it was saint-remy. Yes, I-- no. I think it was at auvers. No, I guess I remembered it wrong. Not the right one. [ Kathy ] Not this one, huh, vince? Okay. Next one. [ Gabe ] how many churches you gonna take me to before you remember? I'm sorry, gabe. Not the right church. [ Vincent ] Not the right church. I don't know what's wrong. My mind is cloudy. Oh, come on, vince. Come on! Not this one either, vince? No. No. I've seen more churches on this trip... Than michelangelo saw in his whole lifetime. I'm beginning to think that your time would be better spent in New York... Just cranking out your autobiography. That way at least we'd get a best seller for all our aggravation. Gabe, everything you say, everything you think... Is tied to the almighty dollar. - youre always trying figure out a way to make a deal. - yes, that's true. That's why my mind isn't working. I can't stand greed. "Greed"? Well, I like that. You're accusing me of being greedy? Who went to bat for you? Who went to bat for you with that judge? I jeopardized my law profession for you! And who sold the rights to your story to get you out on bail? And who pushed to get head of boy x-rayed? Nobody has given more of himself for your cause than me and what I've gotten back doesn't even pay my phone bill! You're right, gabe. I owe you an apology. You're darn right you do! I'm sorry. Apology accepted. And I promise you this. If we find those paintings, the biggest piece of the pie... Goes to those hungry artists that you want to help. All I'm gonna take is my hourly fee to manage the trust. Cross my heart and hope to die. I always knew that underneath that sarcastic and crass manner of yours... There was a good man inside. [ Chuckles ] And now I'm here to tell you... We're very near the church. The-- the church? We're near the church? Right around the next bend. Follow me. [ Gabe ] V-vince, I don't want you to do the talking. You let me handle this, okay? [ Kathy ] gabe, what if no one speaks english? Oh, who cares about english? Parlez-vous français? Très bien. Merci Come on. Uh, excuse me. Hi. - do you speak english? - yes. Oh, good. Good, good. Um, we're looking for some paintings that my friend stored here... In a crypt years and years ago. To disturb a soul's eternal rest is a great sin. No, no, no, no. It's not bodies we're looking for. It's paintings. Great treasures. - it's out of the question. - why don't you just let him look at the crypts? I mean, what harm could it do? There is even a wonderful painting of this very church inside. - I'd like to show you. - this church here? Please. Let us show you. I can only give you a few minutes. Thank you. Thank you. [ Door opening ] Stay here. Most of the crypts are down this way. See anything, vince? Vincent, do you need some help? Well? Well? Well, what? Well, did you find 'em? It's no use. I've looked at all of the sarcophagus. I've looked at all of the crypts. Could it be that I've picked the wrong place again? Vince, I didn't bring you all this way so you could give up now. Come on. Just try one more time. It's hopeless. It's hopeless. Just hopeless! I feel so cloudy in my mind. I-- we have to go now. I have no more time. Think, vincent, think. This whole mission will evaporate like a cloud if you give up now. It won't be the first time I've tried to do something... And failed. - what did you just say? - it's gonna evaporate like a cloud. Cloud. "Jean paul nuage." Nuage in french means "cloud." This is it, gabe. This is why I've seen only clouds inside my mind. Help me open it up. Hold the lantern. [ Caretaker ] No, no, you mustn't open it! We must open it. Harder, gabe. [ Grunting ] Harder. [ Crypt lid creaking ] [ Gabe ] Oh, they're here! My god, look at this! Show him the portrait of the church. Ah. Oh, look at this! [ Gabe ] oh, my god. Oh, they're beautiful, vince. - like I said, huh? - oh, vincent! Look! [ Chuckling ] Oh! My god, vincent. This is beautiful. Oh, kathy, look at this. [ Laughing ] We found them. Yes. [ Male newscaster ] And so the entire world is in awe... As news of what could be the most incredible art discovery of the century.. Has sped at the speed of light to every continent on the globe. The president of france was so surprised... At what might prove to be the discovery of the long-lost van gogh paintings... That he like many other international leaders... Is not willing to rule out the possibility... That vincent may be who he says he is. [ Ringing ] Madison gallery. Oh, kathy, I'm so glad you called. Where are you? Well, there have been some offers on vincent's Los Angeles paintings, big offers, but of course I couldn't make any deal until I heard from you. Honey, they want all twenty, but didn't he give the big hell's angels one to me? - "garson." - it's garçon, gabe. [ Groaning ] [ Sighs ] Let's go over the final terms again. Okay. Twelve new paintings to Mr. Takimoto... For a total of $600 million, and he guarantees that six months each year... They'll be displayed in museums throughout the world. Oh, that's great. And alex manners? He got seven paintings for 400 million. That's nineteen out of twenty paintings. Number twenty was the big hell's angels. Of course. My gift to your aunt gladys. Yes. We can only get Mr. Manners... To agree to three-month public display each year at the national gallery of art That's a billion dollars! A billion dollars. You've come a long way, vincent. It's quite remarkable. - but did the buyers agree to the resale clause? - definitely. The van gogh charity fund for needy artists... Will receive 20% of all profits... Each time any of the paintings are resold. One thing left we need to do. That's to make a list of where all my old paintings and drawings are kept. Already working on it. Of course. You're on top of everything, gabe. [ Kathy ] What are you looking at? [ Vincent ] the eiffel tower. It seems to get taller every time I see it. [ Laughing ] Here, kathy. Ah, well. There we go. Hmm. Kathy? The time has come to appoint a president for my charity fund. Will you accept? Oh, vincent. If you have confidence in me, then yes, I accept. I have all the confidence in the world in you. Mmm. Mm! I forgot to tell you. Gabe called. His plane landed in the states. He's already got the museum experts examining the paintings. Pretty soon they'll know that they're authentic. Yes, that is good. Soon the whole world will know that I've been telling truth about who I really am. Right. What about the paintings he discovered in france? I predict that vincent's long-lost paintings... Were created as recently as 1992. - yes. - but how could vincent have known... That the paintings were hidden in that church? Obviously, this is all a setup. He's not acting alone, but I can assure you... He'll find out very soon the international public... Is not as gullible as he thinks we are. You know, detective murphy thinks she's got you beat on this. Mm-hmm. She'll be the doubting thomas till the very end. No matter. It reminds me of the gospel during my preaching days in belgium. Do you remember what the lord said to thomas? He said, "thomas, "because you have seen me, you have believed. "Blessed are those who have not seen... And yet have believed." She wouldn't believe even if she could see. Oh, enough about her. The only thought I have on my mind is a toast to you, my dear kathy madison, and with all my love. [ Clinking ] Kathy? I hope that you can find someone that you can love and marry... And have children with. Well, I've already fallen in love... With you. Kathy, nothing would make me happier than to marry you. But it wasn't meant to be. It wasn't fated. Well, what does fate have to do with it? Everything. When the flowers called me back to this world, it was only for a short while. No, the flowers didn't call you back. The flowers can't make decisions. The flowers don't have souls. Don't say that. They do. They most certainly do have souls. I have a confession to make. I've squandered a little money today. What did you buy? I happen to have it right here. It's a new yellow hat. It's for you. Oh. For me? - there you go. - wait. - beautiful. - [ Chuckles ] [ Laughing ] [ Sighs ] Hello. Hello. I never cared about growing old before. But now I think it would be lovely... To watch my hair becoming white, to walk with a cane, arm in arm with you. You have many years before you become old, vincent. You have many years, kathy. Not me. Kathy, darling, the sea is calling out to me. Listen. It's whispering my name. I don't hear anything but you, vincent. I'll always be with you, kathy. When you Miss me, look into one of my paintings.
