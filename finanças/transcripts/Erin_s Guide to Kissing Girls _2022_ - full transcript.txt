Yeah, when you said your mom went shopping for you, I kind of feared for the worst. - Well, if I get into Riverside, it'd just be a uniform. - You could not pay me to wear a uniform. - Okay, well, at least everyone's kind of equal that way. - Yeah, and totally blend into each other. - Anyways, I probably didn't even get in.

Okay, I made a list. Please, narrow it down. - Okay. Definitely one of the blood baths. 100%. - Didn't you think that homework was kind of hard last night? - I didn't do it. - Not surprised. - Who did? - It's useless. - Yeah, so pointless. - Leave my childhood alone. - Teacher's corner is just garbage. - So boring, exactly. - And if we have time Killer Cat. - Yes. Oh, I was also thinking maybe the new Kittens with Claws: Curiosity Killed the Cat. - Well, here's a thought.

Wait. - Wait, is that from Riverside? I got in. I got in. I got in. - I knew it. - I got in. - Congrats. - See, I told you. - Go call your dad. I'll make the reservation tonight to celebrate. - I'm gonna call dad. - Don't forget we have a math test in two days. Tonight would be a good time to do the chapter practice quiz. All right, let's pick up where we left off with natural selection. Oh, perfect timing. Everyone, this is Sydni. Our very own classroom celebrity. Do you wanna introduce yourself? - Hi, Sydni Hunter. - Okay, great. Well, you can sit right over here. And this is your textbook. Actually, Sydni, why don't you read for us from the top of page 78? - Maybe she'll sing it. Okay. Farah, can you get the lights? - Natural selection is the process through which populations of living organisms adapt and change. Individuals in a population are all a little different in some ways, but some individuals have traits better suited to their environment than others. Those individuals with weaker traits are far less likely to survive. - Go, Chris. - Go, Jarred. You got this. - Woo. - Go on without me. - Stage one. - Why does that new girl look so familiar? - Right? Is she like an influencer? - You mean you don't know? That's Lola. Like from "Good Morning Lola". - She just moved here from San Francisco. - That show like, raised me. - Do you think it'd be weird if I asked her for an autograph? - Do you think she still talks with Officer Whitlock? - Didn't he die? - I don't think so. - Apparently, during her audition, she forgot like all of her lines and she just made something up and they thought it was cute. That's how she got her role. - She's so hot. - I know. - Oh, my God, my legs are so sore. - God, you were like huffing and puffing like... Oh, I'm gonna die. - I was going to die. - No you weren't. - It's like the rest of school. - Erin, hey, can I ask you a question real quick? When you two hang out, is it like. - Oh, Scarlet Tampon. - Oh. my God. You guys are so mean. - Just ignore them. - So are all the boys at this school virgins or is that just you two? - Chill, it was just a joke. - Jokes are supposed to be funny, like that haircut. - Yeah, whatever, Lola. ♪ Ooh ♪ ♪ Ooh ♪ ♪ Like dynamite ♪ ♪ Need a cheerleader ♪ ♪ Let me throw you down ♪ ♪ While I look at her ♪ ♪ I'm like "Oh, my God ♪ ♪ I think I need a girlfriend" ♪ - Now, before we head home, I think the dance committee has an announcement to make.

And now to announce this year's theme. This year, your fall formal theme is... - Sadie Hawkins. - That means girls get to ask the boys. So everyone put the 15th in your calendars and let's make this the best fall formal yet. ♪ Keep your hands up ♪ - Wow, that was something. Okay, I'll see you tomorrow. Go home. - Oh, my God. I'd rather pull out my own toenails. - Yeah. - It's looking bleak. Scarlet Sparrow has used her very last infinity arrow and Lunar Girl's too weak to produce any more shields. The Shadowman closes in on them. When, out of nowhere, a ray of light burst through the darkness. A glowing figure emerges covered in stars. She easily vanquishes the Shadowman with her lunar ray. She then turns to our heroes. "The moon queen is dead," she says. To be continued. - Dude. It's so epic. - Really? - Yes, yes it is. I don't know if this is blasphemous but you could like give Crystal Green a run for her money. - Shut up, no way. - Yes, you could. - Crystal Green is like a perfect goddess. - Um, who is this new character? - Oh, I just made her up. Her name's Adelaide. She's like a moon princess or whatever. - So is Lunar going to the moon by herself? - Oh, um, I don't know yet. Maybe. - You can't do that. - Why not? - They're a team. You can't separate them. - I guess. - If lunar were to go to the moon by herself it would- it would be... - So do you wanna go with me? - Okay, but only if I get to keep these doughnuts. - I am so glad that after another six months, I never have to see any of these basic Barbies ever again. - So you're going to Riverside for sure then. - Yeah, it has like, one of the best track programs in the country. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course. Just don't forget me when you're big and famous is all. - As if, okay. What was I talking about? Oh, I really don't think that Lunar should go to the moon by herself. They should be together because Lunar hasn't been home in a really long time and I think Scarlet Sparrow would make it so that... - Okay, how is everyone feeling about "Anne of Green Gables" so far? Okay, has anyone read chapter 15? Liz. - Huh? - What about you? - Um, am I supposed to like Gilbert? He's kind of a jerk. Like don't- don't pull on people's hair. That's just rude. - Oh, my God, don't be so sensitive. He obviously did that because he likes her. - That's so problematic. If you need to physically assault a girl to tell her that you like her, then you should just probably stay far away from her. - Okay, yeah. Some interesting ideas. Let's unpack that. Okay. - I like Lola better when you can mute her. - Well, I'd like you a lot better with my fist in your face you douche bag. - Oh, my God. - Mr. Johnson. You're here. - Young lady, could you join me in my office, please? - Oh, my God. Did you see Derek's face? - He can be so annoying. - Sydni just- just totally shut him down. Like completely. She's incredible. - I mean, I basically said the same- - And she didn't even care when Mr. Johnson walked in like, at all. I would've been freaking out, but- - Sydni, that was so badass. Can you teach me how to be that cutthroat? - Aren't you guys like friends with them or something? - Who, Chris and Derek? Ugh, they're the worst. They've both been like in love with me since grade one. What happened with Mr. Johnson? - Um, he said that he wants me to participate in something called mindfulness minutes. - Oh, yeah, they're trying to rebrand detention. Anyways, I'm having a party next weekend and I'd love for you to be there. - Thanks. - So how did you get into acting? I'm trying to break in myself. - I was like, six. - Okay, bye. - Oh, my God. She's so cool. - Oh, do you like Lola? - Sydni. I- I mean, no. I don't... I don't know. Maybe. I dunno, shut up. This could be my chance to finally kiss a girl. - Do you even know if she likes girls? Does she even know you exist? - Don't worry about it. I have a plan. - So Daniel is building three shelves for his wife, Emily. He has a piece of lumber, 12 meters long. He would like the bottom shelf... Nope, the top shelf to be half a meter shorter than the bottom shelf and the bottom shelf to be half a meter shorter than twice the... Wait, is that right? - Erin, yeah. - Why does Daniel have to build the shelves? Why can't Emily do it? - Uh, well, I don't- - And why are all the examples men and women? - Well- - This textbook is oppressive and I'm not gonna stand for it any longer. - What is happening today? Breathing in tranquility. Breathing out that which doesn't serve us. Breathing in tranquility. Breathing out what no longer serves us. Well, I certainly feel calmer already. Not thinking at all about how I'd rather be at home, watching "The Bachelor" with my cats. Well, why don't you two practice that and I will step out for a moment. - So have you seen those cologne ads by the bus stops? What women really want? - No. - Did you sing the intro for Good Morning Lola? - Could we not with the whole Lola thing? - I never thanked you for after gym the other day. - Yeah, well, making fun of boys is like my hobby. - Yeah, I always think of really good comebacks right before I go to bed. Like who dressed you, your mom? But I can never think of stuff in the- in the moment. - That sort of thing. Does that happen with those guys and you a lot? - No, that's- that's just Chris and Derek. I mean, nobody actually cared or whatever when I came out. - My mom's are gay. - Wait, what? Really? - Yeah. - Whoa, that's so... That's so- that's great. Sorry. Yeah, oh, that's- that's so cool. Oh, my gosh. - Hey, you know, I'm sorry about snapping at you earlier. I just don't wanna be known as the child actor freak. - Yeah, it's okay. People just need to get to know you better. You got an invite to Janet Wexler's party, right? - Yeah, but I don't think I'll go. I mean, I don't really know anybody so. Are you going? - Oh, yeah. Yeah, of course. Definitely. Yeah, everyone gets invited. Janet's parties are the best. - Wicked. - We could maybe go together if you wanted to. - Yeah, I'd be down. - Okay, amazing. Let's move on to positive affirmations, mm. - No, because I swear her and her cats definitely have matching shirts. - For sure. I bet she calls them her furry babies. - Um, I'll text you about the party. - Yeah, awesome. - Cool, yeah, later. - Bye. - What was that about? - Liz, Sydni has gay moms. - Huh? - Like moms, plural. Moms that mom together. She's even cooler than I thought. - She has gay moms? - So I'm gonna ask her to the dance, right. And I figure that when the mood is right, when we're slow dancing, I'm gonna go in for the kiss. - You're gonna ask her out to the fall formal? - Yeah, why? - 'Cause we hate dances. - I know, but it could be fun. - No, it couldn't. I'm planning on avoiding as many people as possible until graduation. - I don't know, I just... I really like her, okay. - Fine, I'll help. - Really? - When do you plan on asking her out? - I was thinking Janet Wexler's party. - But we aren't invited to that party. - Mm, about that, um, I may have said that we were. - Hmm. Ahuh, okay. This'll be a disaster. - It'll be fine. We'll just... We'll stick together and it'll be like a mission. Operation catch that kiss. - How long did it take you to come up with that one? - Only like an hour. - What about our anti-Janet party? - Oh, we'll do it next weekend. Come on, Liz, please. I need my wing woman for this. Please. - Ew, ew, okay. - Please. - Ew, no, okay. Stop making that face. It's gross. - You are the freaking best. - Okay, help me up. - Oh, yeah, how was practice? - It was not good. Everyone kept running into me. Like, what the heck?

I mean, Sydni's actually like, you know, gay? - God, Jess, you can't just ask if someone is gay. - Who knew Erin had game? - Not us. - Okay, I think I'm ready. - Oh, okay.

Erin, did you do something new with your hair today? - Oh, um, I showered this morning. - Well, we were just putting up some posters for the dance. It's gonna be a lot of fun. Sydni, I watched "Love Simon" last night. It's such a beautiful story. Anyways, we should probably do the grade eight hall. See you guys later. - The shirts. Hard pass. - Yeah, I know, right. School dances are so dumb. Like who'd even want to go to that? Would be so lame. Yeah, I dunno.

Don't underestimate the quiet kids, right? - Yes, yes. On the- on the outside, we may seem like total losers, but on the inside, well, we're still losers, but sometimes we have good comebacks. - Well, I have something that might cheer you up. My parents got me tickets to Comic-Con for getting into Riverside. - Oh, my God, really? - And they got me two, in case you wanna go. - Oh, obviously. - Okay, good, because I already have a lot of ideas for costumes. - Oh, of course. - That one's- that one's mine. Okay, I'm thinking more feathers. - I forgot how good gummy worms are. So I was working on my comic again and I have this new scene where Adelaide comes in and she's holding this like glowing rock thing and is like, "Lunar Girl, Scarlet Sparrow, this is a wishing gem." And then they totally freak out 'cause they thought they were all destroyed and stuff. - Is Adelaide secretly evil? That's so suspicious. - What, no. No, no. I- I think she wants to use the wishing gem for good, but like gets carried away sometimes. - I'm just saying, I don't think Scarlet would be here for it. - Yeah, I don't know. I'm still working on it. I- I can't tell if this looks stupid or good. - It looks- it looks good. - You hesitated. - It- okay, it l- - That is so not believable. - It- it looks good. - Oh, my God, you're such a liar. - It looks good. It looks better than when you tried to be Wolverine with a butterfly mask and three plastic forks. - Okay, but when you were R2-D2 you wore a literal trash can for your costume. - Okay, and I looked great. - Yeah, you really did bring a new meaning to hot garbage. - Shut up, shut up. - So did I miss anything super exciting at Janet's party? Are you two like totally BFFs now? - Ugh, no. Yeah, I don't know. It was fine, but it was definitely no anti-Janet party. - Um, well, I'm sorry it didn't work out with Sydni but we could always see what's playing at the Royal that night. - Oh, um, no, I'm still gonna ask her. I- I just wanna do something bigger, you know. Like really impress her. I was thinking I could maybe get on the morning announcements. - I don't know if that's the best thing to- - Or I could- I could bribe the band kids to like, play her favorite song and then I could do like a whole dance routine. That might be cool. - Yeah. - What, do you- you don't think it would work? - Um, I don't know, maybe don't do a musical number. - What kind of flowers do you think she'd like? - Um. - That's cool. - I don't- I don't know. I wish my Riverside orientation was like- like literally any other weekend. - Oh, yeah, kind of sucks. Do you have to go? - I mean, I wanna see what it looks like. - We'll have all of Sunday to nerd out then. - Mm-hm. Wait, um, come here. - Do I have pizza? - No, no, no. Um, I think there's... On your nose. I got you. - Oh, my God. - Yes. - Liz. - What? I didn't do anything. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. - Hey. - Hi. - Hey, um, are you here for the Riverside meetup? - Yes. - Okay. Um, Liz Yang? - Mm-hm. - Great. Okay, you can just go over there and stretch and we'll be with you in a bit. - Okay, thank you. - All right. - Hi, I'm Rachel. - Hi, I'm Liz. - You seem super familiar to me. - Yeah, I feel like I've seen you somewhere before. Were you at OFSAA last year? - Yeah, yeah, I was. - Were you the girl who beat the 1500 record? - That's me. - I don't know if I should hate you or bow down to you. - Oh, my God. You know Lunar Girl and Scarlet Sparrow? - Yeah. - They're like my favorite comic books ever. - Really? I've been into them for like years. - Really? - Oh, yes. - So tell me, what do you think is happening with the Shadowman? - Oh, okay, okay. Buckle in because I have several theories. Number one, he dies. - But she- she, she can't. - Yes, she would. She would totally do that. She's unpredictable like that. - That would mess up... That would mess up the whole plot. - No, it wouldn't, it wouldn't. Okay, hear me out. The shadow man dies, right. Lunar Girl revives him. And then he becomes a better character and is more crucial to them. - Oh, my God. Where is this bus? - Ugh, yeah. I hate this route. Same one I'll have to take to Riverside too. - Oh, right. - Did I tell you about the matching sweaters we got? - Yeah, you sent me a picture. - Oh, okay. Yeah, everyone was so much nicer than I thought they'd be. - That's- that's good. - Okay. Uh, the coaches are super cool too. We went to one of their houses after for- for a barbecue. - Mm. - Oh, there was this girl named Rachel. You'd absolutely love her. She's a super big fan of Lunar Girl and Scarlet Sparrow. - Oh. - Yeah, she's great. I think we're doing the 4 by 10 together. I'm not sure though. There's also this really big pool. It's like olympic sized and the bathrooms actually smell good. Like they're not the ones like at school. They smell like- - Well, well, well my two meanest customers. - We're your only friends. - Headed to Comic-Con? - Mm-hm. - Duh. Why aren't you going nerd? - I was there yesterday, but I have this little thing called rent I have to pay, so. - Oh, ouch. - Sucks. Do you have to the new Lumber Jeans? - I do. It's not on the shelves yet, so I'll go get it for you. But meanwhile, you should read this. - If this is another flyer for your very lame band we are not interested. - Just read it, you little gremlin. I'll be right back. - Are you seeing this? - Oh, my God. Is this real? - Crystal Green is coming here. - Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Let me see, let me see, let me see. - We're gonna meet Crystal Green. Do you think she'll sign my goggles? We should get some books for her to sign. Crystal Green. Wait, where are you... Are you... What's wrong? Why aren't you excited? - It's the same day as the dance. - So who cares? - Well, I'm asking Sydni, remember. - Erin, this is Crystal Green. Is there really any competition? - This dance is important to me too. - You haven't even asked her yet. - I'm going to. - You don't even know if she's gay. - You don't get it. - What don't I get? That you've been acting completely fake since you started hanging out with Sydni? - No, I haven't. - Yes, you have. You're acting like a Janet wannabe. - No, I'm not, I- I'm just trying not to be a total loser next year. That's all. - Look at what you're wearing. You're just scared that if Sydni found out that you're a nerd, she wouldn't want to kiss you. - Sydni doesn't care about that stuff and at least she has a backbone. - What does that mean? - You can't even stand up to your mom. Do you even wanna go to that douchey sports school anyway? - Yeah, I do. I've been excited for weeks and you haven't even asked me about it. Do you even know how competitive that school is? - Oh, my God, we get it. You're better than everyone else. Congrats, Liz. - At least I don't have to be fake to suck up to some basic Barbies. - This is why everyone hates you. You act like you're so superior all the time. When really you're not. - Wow, great, you'll- you'll fit right in with Janet and Derek and Chris next year. - Why do you even care? It's not like we're gonna be friends anyway. - You can go to Comic-Con on your own. - Of course I can, asshole. - You're lame. - So, what do you say? - Sure, why not? - For you. - It's gonna be so much fun. - Yeah, I'm so excited. ♪ White shoes or the picket fence ♪ ♪ Then you see it and you ♪ ♪ Want it, want it ♪ ♪ Your bike was fine till the Benz rolled past ♪ ♪ Then you see it and you ♪ ♪ Want it, want it ♪ ♪ Want it, want it ♪ ♪ Want it, want it ♪ ♪ Want it, want it ♪ ♪ Want it, want it ♪ ♪ Want it, want it ♪ ♪ Want I, want it ♪ - Okay, let's pack it up.

No one's gonna be friends with you in high school. - Jess, Jules, and I were thinking of heading to the mall to look at dresses. You should join. - Uh, I can't. Um, I told Erin that we could hang out after school. - What? Oh, oh, right, yeah. - Have fun though. - Your room is so cool. - Yeah, thanks. It's coming along. - You're so cute. In the photo. Can I tell you a secret? - Um, sure. - I've never actually seen "Good Morning, Lola". - Really? - Yeah, Um, I don't know. I just like never got into it as a kid and kind of found it annoying. Not that like, I find of you annoying or found- - No, yeah. The songs were just like really something. - Yeah, I think I've only seen one episode. - Which one? - Oh, uh, something about a cat going missing. - No, "Mittens is Missing". That's like the worst one. No wonder you stopped watching. - I found out on that set that I was like severely allergic to cats. Yeah, I was so out of it on allergy meds I don't even know why it aired. - Wow, kind of feel like I have to re-watch it now. - Well, don't make me regret this, but I do have a bunch of the episodes saved on my laptop. But if you tell anybody, I will never speak to you again. - Okay. ♪ Good morning Lola ♪ ♪ Good morning world ♪ ♪ Play my viola ♪ ♪ With my hair all curled ♪ - Welcome to my garden. - I mean the intro's kind of catchy. - Don't, don't go there. - Do you see Mittens anywhere? - Man I'm terrified the cat is still like, you know, thriving today. - Yeah, he's like totally living off his royalties somewhere. - I know. Maybe if I sing a song Mittens will hear it and she'll come. - Oh, God, this is actually a lot worse than I remember. ♪ Listen to my song. ♪ ♪ I have written my dear little Mittens ♪ - Is that "Good Morning, Lola?" - No. - You must be special if Sydni is showing you that of her own free will. - Hello? - Hey, hun.

Let us know if you need anything at all. - Okay, okay, okay, goodbye, bye bye. They're so annoying. - What are you talking about? They're- they're so awesome and- and nice and cool. They're just cool. Okay, I need to see more. Like it literally looks like someone punched you in the nose. How did they let you act like this? - Yeah, the producer was a dick. He'd like, shame me if I ate too many cookies 'cause he didn't want me to gain any weight. - Oh, um, oh my God. That's- that's so messed up. - Yeah, but once my mom's found out, they pulled me from the show so. - That's really shitty. - Thanks, you're like the only person I've ever told about this. - Oh. - Um, but anyways you get the gist. Um, I'm sorry. - Oh, sorry. I- I just thought, um... that, um... I'm gonna get going. Sorry, it's getting late. - Erin. - Oh, no, it's okay.

I mean a little, but it's my fault too. I'm just not really sure about anything. - But you said yes to the dance. - Well yeah, you asked me in front of everybody. - Oh. I just thought like, with the party and then the games closet and everything. - Who else was I supposed to pick? Plus like, nobody was calling me Lola after that. - Yeah, but they thought you were gay. - I guess that was kind of gross of me. I'm sorry. - I mean, to be fair, you got Janet Wexler to wear rainbows. Maybe she'll even start at GSA next year. - Why do we care so much about what these idiots think of us? - I'm gonna be stuck with them for four years so. - Dude, do you know anything about high school? There's gonna be like, so many new people there. - Yeah, but they won't be Liz. - You know, you can have more than one friend, right? - I'd still like to be your friend if that's okay. - Do you still wanna go this dance? - No way. - Listen, I'm saying just like people who are that homophobic they are definitely still in the closet. - Okay, but- but Janet? - Oh, hell yeah. Just give her another four to five years. - But she's like if- if compulsive heterosexuality was like, a person. - No trust, trust. - Do you have a lip gloss? - Oh, um, yeah. There's some in like the top drawer of my desk, I think. - Cool. - Hey, are you getting rid of these? - Oh, um, yeah. - How come? I thought this was like your whole deal. - Um, it was, but I don't know. I'm- I'm like getting older. Kind of outgrowing them. - Dude, my moms are like 45 and they still read comic books. - I don't know. It's really complicated. - I don't know, but if it were me, I wouldn't throw them out. - Uh, Sydni. - Mm-hm. - Um, on a scale of 1 to 10 how mad would you be if we missed the dance? - Uh, a two. - Okay, um, we have to go. - Huh? - I'll explain on the way there. Come on. - Okay, all right. - Liz. - Erin. - Hey, no cuts. - Erin, what are you doing here? Don't you have a dance to go to or something? - That's not important right now. - Listen, I said no cuts. - Dude, give them a minute. - Why are you here? - Okay, so I was going through my comic, right. And I was trying to figure out how to end it. But everything fell sort of off. Like would Lunar use the last wish to make sure Adelaide becomes the moon princess? - Erin. - Because Adelaide is the rightful heir and all that, but then Lunar would have to stay on the moon to support her. - What issue is this? - And I was thinking would Lunar even wanna stay on the moon especially without Sparrow? And- - What are you even talking about? - Here, let me just- let me just show you. I'm really not explaining this right. Um, it's kind of messy. I had to do it on the car right over and- - Erin, I don't care about Lunar Girl or Adelaide or your stupid wishing gem. It's clear you only care about getting a girlfriend and now that you have one you obviously don't need me anymore, right? - She's- she's not- That's- - I'm not just your sidekick, okay? I have a lot going on too, in case you haven't noticed. - Who's next? Hi. - Sorry. I mean, there's 45 minutes left at the dance. - Yeah, um, I'm not sure I really want to go anymore. - Come on, I mean, we're already dressed. Besides, you need a distraction. - So what's your name? - Uh, Liz. - Nice to meet you, Liz. Ah, an oldie, but a goody. This set of issues were actually some of the hardest for me to write. - Really? - Oh, yeah. When they had both got off on their own quest and grew so much on their own I didn't know how to bring them back together or if I even should. - Wait, like have their own spinoff series? - I don't know, maybe. I was really considering it. - 'Cause that would've been terrible, geez. No offense, I mean you probably could have figured it out. Thank you, Crystal Green. - Crystal's fine. - Oh, okay. I can die happy now. ♪ Ooh ♪ ♪ La la la la la ♪ ♪ Ooh ooh ooh ♪ ♪ La la la la la ♪ ♪ Ooh ooh ooh ♪ ♪ La la la la la ♪ ♪ Ooh ooh ooh ♪ ♪ La la la la la ♪ - So this is a middle school dance.
