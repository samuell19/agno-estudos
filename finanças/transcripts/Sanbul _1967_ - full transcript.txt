You think I'm doing this because I want to? Give me that. Don't you know what they would do to our village? Are you bossing us around because you're the village head? Bitch! When did I boss you around? Stop your bickering and bring this back filled with grain! I won't do it even if you make me! What? What did you say? Sir, my son-in-law died fighting for the North, but this village head from a reactionary family was beating me up. Let me explain. None of us has enough food in the house. But she will not bring her share. The men in these families died fighting for the Southern Army. But my husband died on the mountain. Say whatever you like. You are all reactionaries. Isn't that right? What is wrong with you? Does anyone go fight in a war because they want to? And why bring up the poor dead souls? Sir, we will sort this out. Why don't you take what we've collected? I'll wait and see your family destroyed. I will not die until that happens. Your cursing us will not bring back your dead son-in-law. Mom, that's enough. Am I going to get my breakfast or not? Are you harping on food again? This is making me so upset. Bring me a glass of cold water. Yes. Are you making barley rice or potato rice? You should not make an old man hungry. I want my breakfast! What... - You wench! - So I am a wench! - That mouth of yours! - If it wasn't for him... I won't rot here and die even if I have to work as a maid somewhere. Stop crying! Just drop dead, why don't you? - Drop dead instead of crying! - Stop that! Why blame the poor baby? You'll pay for this later! What good will a child do me? The commies took my husband and our food... How am I supposed to survive? People just cannot live here. Go ahead and do whatever you want. Go to Gwangju or Mokpo and be a whore. Don't you worry about me! I won't ask you for money. Don't worry. Damn girl! No woman in this village has a husband. Mine died long ago, and I'm fifty now. Are you proud of that? You live for your child. Does that give you a chip on your shoulder? - Jeomrye! - Oh... I'll get married. Get married? Yes. - To whom? - In a dream... men I met at the market asked me to marry them. You really want to get married? What happens when you get married? I don't know what getting married is like, but I want to. Grandpa, poppa! Open your jaws! Kimchi is coming. Snot and snoot! Grandpa's thing is like a squishy persimmon. Grandpa, poppa! Grandpa's thing is like a squishy persimmon. Grandpa! - Monkeys have red butts... - Shut your mouth. Grand... Put away that stick and stop hitting me! Are we having barley again? - I like potatoes and rice. - I do too! When are you going to grow up? Father, please stop asking for food. What? We'll have white rice? I'll have two bowls then. I'll have three bowls of it. My cursed life... In my old age too... Idiot! Go and find Jeomrye. Where is she? Look at Kkeutsun, and see how she makes a living for her mom. I can do it too! If you get sick, I'll take care of you! That mouth of yours! - Kkeutsun! - What is that? - It's corn gruel. - I see. How is your mother? - Mom! - Who is it? Jeongnim brought you some gruel. I hope you're feeling better. Thank you for coming. I should go to Gwangju or Mokpo to make money. What about your mother? I can't just sit here and starve! I can work as a maid somewhere. You need connections to work even as a maid. How will you find a job when you leave here? We wouldn't be like this if your brother was still alive. What kind of world kills off every man there is! With us women hung out to dry for the rest of our lives... I'll throw that away. - Is that okay? - Don't worry. I am sorry. I'll bring a sack next time. My hands are blistered! I don't see how I can make a living. Do you know who's winning the war? Who knows when we are on this mountain? I am tired of it. It's been more than two years. I know. My husband doesn't even show up in my dreams anymore. I know. If he is still alive, he'll be thinking about you. Isn't there a war where your husbands don't drop dead? I know... My life is worse than a dog's life. - Isn't it? - I hear you. What is this? Look at this. They're a man's clothes. What? Where? You look happy just smelling it. Well, we've been starving for that, haven't we? Damn him... how come he only left his clothes behind? You said it. It's not like we'll eat him up. You know there's a rumor. Some say they've seen a man in our village. That's a crock of shit. And that he only shows up at night. Shows up where? And there is a woman with him. Who's going around saying this nonsense? There've been no men here for a long time! We don't have a man in our village! Everyone, look what I've found! Do you know what it is? - What is it? - A man's clothes! You can smell a man on these clothes. What? - We can all smell these... - She must've missed it that much. It'll drive you crazy! I can't believe what I'm seeing. What's the use of a parent or child? That's not what you need. We're poor and uneducated. So we wait for our husbands like idiots, knowing they're dead. Things will get better someday... I'm going home. Jeomrye! Where have you been? I went to town to get my mother's medicine. Is she that sick? I wish she would either die or get better soon. You don't mean that. I can't even work as a maid because I can't leave her. Don't say that. She's your mother. Everywhere you go in town, they ask for your identification card. They ask for it especially if you're a man. The police haul off anyone who looks strange. I wish we had one of those cards. How about we just pick up and leave this place? Waiting for someone dead will not bring them back alive. I want to get a better life before I get older. Things will just get harder for you in your old age. Who would blame me for getting married again? Would someone praise me for enduring this misery? You should make up with Jeomrye's mother-in-law. They are just like us. We are not enemies. Is my son dead or alive? I wish we had some news. Whatever news it might be. It's been three years. If he was alive, we should've known by now. He should've stayed put and tilled the family land. Why did he go into the war and get himself killed? We're lucky he didn't go and fight for the North in the mountains. It's all the same. They are all dead! If he had thought about me at all, he wouldn't have done that. But he really was a good son to you. He should've given you a child like Sawol's husband. I'll go and drop by her house. It's not like we are enemies. You're right. We are all the same. - Get them some sweet potatoes. - Yes. - Hurry back home. - Yes. I came to keep you company. Try some. There must be someone waiting for you, yes? You're safe here, but your family must be worried. Can you please say something? You're not a talker, are you? Is your wife pretty? Do you miss her? Do you have a kid? Can you please say something? Are you home? Try these sweet potatoes. You shouldn't have. We have them too. Where is Jeomrye? What? Didn't she go to your place? - My place? - Yes. Will we have some good news at the market? It'll be a good thing if we can see men there. Same old same old. It was not this far when I went with my husband. I know... How could they drag away every man from our village? - Let's hurry. - Mom! Isn't she Guideuk? Mom, I want to go with you! You idiot! Wasn't it enough that you stole and ate the eggs! Why are you here? I didn't steal them. Jeomrye gave them to me. Shush! And just go back home. No, I want to go! She wants to go with you that badly. Why not let her? See? Listen to her! - Let's hurry! - What's wrong with her? Grandpa, poppa! Who knew this war would turn her into an idiot? She should've just died in that bombing. We even spent money for her medicine... The war killed my son and left me with her. Don't say that. She is not an idiot. We are all idiots, waiting for our men for years. Hello? Is anybody home? I need to take a breather here. Oh my goodness! Where's my pisspot? I thought you were a ghost. Is my dinner ready? Is it going to rain? Where is everyone? I was going to ask you that. Where is everyone? My eyes are sore. I couldn't sleep well. Straighten your clothes with a cotton stick, why don't you? You're back. He wouldn't know it even if he got robbed. Take a look. I have new fabrics. I can't afford it. We're lucky not to go around naked. What are you saying? Fine feathers make fine birds, you know. The men in the village will fall for you. We don't have any men here. Did you see the fabric seller? There she is. Aren't you going to have a looksee? No, I don't want to. Didn't I tell you she must be here? - Ma'am, what have you got here? - I was waiting for you. - Hello. - So, what did your mom say? She asked for a matchmaking. Are there any marriageable men in the city? Stop... You should try. Who would think she's a widow? Don't go around telling everyone. You're embarrassing me. You're the one who wants to remarry. Can you please look for a place where I can work as a maid? You're asking for too many favors without buying anything. Let's go to my place and talk about this. All right. Well... See you then. Do you really want to work as a maid? I have to. It would be easier if you married an old man. - Like someone around 50. - Ma'am! Can I have a word with you? I told you to buy something. You ran all the way here? It's... I need to ask something. What is it? - I'll catch up with you. - Okay... Can a stranger go into the city? I don't think so! They search everyone because of the guerillas. Even peddlers like us get inspected everywhere. At every station, policemen or soldiers ask for ID. You want to go somewhere? You can't even go a mile without an ID. Can the men in the mountains turn themselves in? Mountains? You mean those commies? What if someone was duped by them but ran away later? I don't see how he'll be spared. But you can go and ask. But how should I know? Where is your hometown? Are you married? Do you have wife? How come you don't tell me a thing about yourself? I will tell you. I was a teacher. An elementary school teacher. He was a good man, a fine teacher for children. - So your husband was a teacher? - Yes, an elementary school teacher. After he was dragged off to the mountains, I never saw him again. I guess he's dead now. Your life is as tough as mine. If I don't do this, my family will starve to death. Her husband was also dragged off to the mountains and didn't come back. He must be dead... It's stupid to wait for them. Everyone is so miserable. Her brother ran away before this chaos took place, so he may be alive somewhere. You can't hide like this forever. How about turning yourself in? You didn't kill anyone. They dragged you to the mountains. You won't get punished. Turn yourself in. No, they will kill me if I do. I don't want to die. I'll do anything. I'll live in a cave or a pigsty if I have to. Just leave me be. I'm afraid something terrible might happen... I don't have money, and I am uneducated. I live like a dead soul every day. Are you afraid because of me? Or tired of me? Don't say that. How could you say that to me? No woman sleeps with a man she doesn't like. Please let me stay here until things quiet down. I can starve. I want to survive as long as I can. I understand... - Look here! - Oh my goodness! What is that in your hand? You can see for yourself. Dishes... Why do you have dishes with you? You can't fool me. What's going on? I have nothing to tell you. Do you think I don't know? Follow me. Come on! Should I tell the one in the cave? - Tell him know you're here? - Don't do this. So who is he? Cat got your tongue? Say something. He is my cousin. Yeah, right. You're sleeping around with your cousin? Sawol... Stop mincing around and tell me the truth. Just promise me one thing, and I'll tell you. I'm no child. Just go ahead and tell me. I promise I won't say a word. I am thirsty. Listen. How could you hide a man in this bamboo grove and have all the fun by yourself? It's not like that. Not like that at all. I just felt sorry for him. If he gets caught, he will be dead. I feel more sorry for us. To be this young and left without our husbands. Although someone got herself a man. Sawol, don't be sarcastic, and listen to me. He was a school teacher. Teacher or not, he is still a commie. They are the ones who killed our husbands. How come you are on his side? Let's go to the police and report him. He is not a commie. He was a teacher. He was just born a man in this terrible world. They dragged him to the mountains away from his home and school. It is the truth. My hometown is a village with flowers. Peach, apricot blossom, and baby azalea. Red and pink all the flowers. How I miss the time when I was in my hometown. The songs of home that I can still hear. I can still see the playground when I close my eyes. And those innocent eyes. How are they? I can see the riverbank where my wife was waiting for me. You leave home and you're left with longing. They dragged me from one mountain to another. Those miserable and wretched years... When will I be free to go back home and see my family? People without a hometown will never know this longing to be back home again. Think about how much he must miss his wife. Maybe our husbands are not different from him now. It's so sad... I know you'll feel the same way, and help him survive. Now that I know, I want to help him too. Let's take turns and help him. - Take turns? - Yes. I also want to help this poor man. I'll bring him food and clothes too. Thank you, but don't bother him too much. You mean be an errand girl and get nothing for my trouble? And you have all the fun? - Stop this crazy talk. - Crazy talk? If you're going to be this way, I have my ideas too. Sawol! Do whatever you want! - I'll go to the police. - Sawol! Sawol! Please don't. Do whatever you want, but please spare him... He's a poor man... Change your mind then! All right. Just don't tell anyone. He will turn himself in soon. Don't worry. He's precious to you and also to me. I'll visit him tonight then. One thing, though. You stay home when I visit him! Don't be scared. My name is Sawol. She told you about me! Only two of us know, so don't worry. Get out! Then I will go straight to the police. Police? I am a woman too. So what difference does it make? Does it matter who brings you food? It only matters that you'll have food to survive. What? You mean... you two will keep me like an animal? What does it matter? You'll get to live. Do it then. Like raising livestock, put me in a cage feed me food, and mate with me when you want to. Even if that's how you feel, there isn't anything you can do about it. Even if I have to keep you locked up like a pig, I can't let you go! What's wrong? It's just that we were born into this messed up world. When the spring comes, go back to your family. Turn over a new leaf in your life. - Do we have any other choice? - Mother... Don't worry about us. We'll manage to eke out a living. I wish I could seeh im just once before I die. I'm going out for some fresh air. Hey! Hey! Come here. Oh no! How come you are here? I'll follow you. No one is sleeping yet. I came to tell you that I am not some beast. - How could you send her... - Please calm down. I'll be there. Go! Hurry! All right. - You have to... - Yes. Mister... Mister... I'm going to go even if it costs me my life. This place has become more dangerous. You can't even go a mile without an ID. Don't be foolish. I have a friend who lives 50 miles from here. He doesn't know who I am, though. We used to be close in college. But you were with those people in the mountains... Who would speak up for you? How about turning yourself in? I can do it for you. No! I'll also pay for what I did. For hiding you here. Won't they spare us? I want to live! I don't want to die! I really want you to be all right. They won't kill you if you turn yourself in. - The fighter plane sound... - It's all right. - It's okay. - It'll kill me. We'll all die if they start fighting again. Why is it hovering over us? Don't go round and round. Decide what you're going to do! - Ma'am. - Yes? We won't survive if they start fighting again. No one will survive. The Southern Army will be here to kill off all the mountain guerillas. This mountain is rugged for soldiers to fight on in winter. Thank goodness the Southern Army will be here. But we'll run out of food soon. - Did you hear about Sawol? - What? She is terribly sick. I heard from Ssallye. Oh, no... Is she getting better? She even throws up porridge. Maybe she's gotten sick because she's too lonesome. Maybe I should just have her remarry someone. She sounds very sick. - She is... - I'll look in on her. Sure. Oh no... Ssallye! - Yes. - Try patting her back. Sure. - Sawol, are you pregnant? - I'll kill you if you say that again! How can I get pregnant without a husband? Say something that stupid, then I'll kill you. Watch that crazy mouth of yours. She must have one foot in the grave. You're in trouble. Oh! Where is he? Mister! Mister! Where is he? About Sawol... You know why, right? She's got morning sickness. She must be pregnant! How can she be? Without her husband? You say that, and she'll bludgeon you to death. You know what Sawol's mom is like. I am sure about this! We've been there. Vomiting and feeling nauseated! You know what that means. Watch what you say. It all sounds like hogwash. You don't believe me? I'll see you later. Are you a new servant? What? They hired a servant because they're too lazy to work. Grandpa, where's Mom? It's spring, and I feel itchy all over. You don't understand what I'm saying. - Gwideok. - What? Where is Jeomrye? She told me to go when I said I was hungry. Are you hungry again? What is wrong with your stomach? Why didn't she come back with you? How much arrowroot will she bring? I'm hungry, too. Get me some food. Me too. I want some food too. The grandfather and his granddaughter are so alike! There is no food. We can barely have two meals a day! You have no food for me, but you can afford a servant? What are you talking about? Since when do we have a servant? I know everything. You ingrate! - Ingrate... - You're being senile! What servant are you talking about? The war took away our husbands. Many people died. My sister-in-law went crazy because of a bomb attack. And so did my father-in-law. All the village women are uneducated, and we barely scrape out a living. Life is hard for a widow. I don't know how I was able to survive until now. Can you please love me too? Please... I won't go back home anymore. I'll stay with you no matter what. I can't stand being without you even for a moment. Please go home. No, you can't do this. You can't do this to me. What? Please... I'll kill you! Die! No... Why are you doing this? She's pregnant with your child. Why are you doing that? You'll soon be leaving. It's not her fault for wanting to be with you. She loves you, and that's not a crime. Poor people like us have to look out for one another. Tell me who's been spreading the rumor! Tell me! Oh my... Calm down and speak slowly. Who's making up a story that my daughter is pregnant? Your daughter should know. What did you say, you bitch? Did you ever see smoke without a fire? What did you just say? - Who are you bitching at? - Bitching did you say? - Yes, bitching. - Let's have it out right here! - Are you nuts? - My daughter lost her husband, - but you're saying she's pregnant? - I'm not making it up. - We all lost people. - Stop them! Please don't do this. - What is all this? - What is it all about? Pull them apart! - Let go of me! - Let go! Why are you holding me, but not her? Go ahead! Tell the people in the mountains! Tell them to slash my throat, why don't you? Please, you're too old for this. Right... now that the Southern Army will be here, you want your revenge. Go ahead, but nothing will change. Everyone here gave food to the guerillas. Whatever you do, I'll do exactly the same thing to you! Who here hasn't helped the ones in the mountains? - There she is! - You're the village head! When did I... Did you just grab my hair? Tear the dresses, so that I can sell more clothes. Look at my fabric. You can pay for it with rice. You don't have to buy. Just take a look. - Come and take a look! - She's so thoughtless. Selling clothes in the middle of this fighting. I am barren. I can't have a child. I thought it was my husband, but now I see it was me. You're pregnant. Why don't you just run away with him? Don't say that. Why am I the one who gets stuck with a baby all the time? What's the use of a child without the father? Then beg him. He has his own family. You lied to your own mother? Who is the father? Tell me, who is it? - Ma'am. - Tell me who he is. Is he from some noble family? Or a rich family? Ma'am... I never thought you'd pull the wool over my eyes! - You whore! - Please, don't. - You lied to your own mother? - Ma'am. What is all this? Jeomrye! Well... Jeomrye! Where are you going, all dressed up? I'm leaving for Gwangju. She's getting married. I came to say goodbye. I had no choice. I want to start over. Good for you. He is old but a nice man. - Sawol? - Yes... Are you all right? It's nothing. She just can't eat. Jeongnim, you go and have a good life. People might badmouth me. No one is going to. I'd do the same if I had the chance. You should think about it. Who would know if we grow old here and die? I'm done for. Go before it gets late. Yes... Take care of yourself. Come by when things get better. Yes. Goodbye. Bye. I feel as if I'm taking away one of your friends. - See you! - Don't look back. Come on. We have a long way to go. You should leave tomorrow morning. Forgive us for what we've done to you. We shouldn't have done what we did. Your family must be looking for you. I can't imagine how much they must miss you. It's heartbreaking to wait for your loved ones. We'll take you to town, so that you can go to the police station. Things will just get worse if you stay here. We should decide now. It's breaking my heart. And Sawol is going to have your baby.. Don't worry about the child. The mountain people must have come down again for food. - Come! - Everyone! Come here! - What is it? - What's going on? - Are we all here? - I think so. Yes. Good. As you may have heard, there will be a clean-up operation of the commies. To do this, we need to destroy the forests and burn the bamboo groves where they can hide. - What? The bamboo grove? - No, not the bamboo grove! - Please don't do this! - Listen up! I think you've seen them. Our reconnaissance planes found that too many bamboo groves in this village provide guerillas with places to hide. - But we can't burn them. - No, we can't. Our ancestors are buried there. We've been making a living because of the grove. - You cannot burn it down! - You just can't! No way! No way! - We can't risk... - No, please! Your lives and property to save the bamboo grove. I'd appreciate your cooperation. - No! - Let's do this. Please, please, don't do that! Come on! Ma'am! - Not the bamboo grove! - Please let go! What are you doing? No way! Damn it! I will burn my own bamboo grove! What's that? Is it food? This? I have to burn the bamboo grove! That's good. Please, sir, not the bamboo grove. I can't let you do this! Please! - Please, sir. - Ma'am, you can't stay here! Mother, what's going on? Stop him! They're burning our bamboo groves to catch the commies! - Sir, please. - Mother. How can we burn the land of our ancestors? - I can't let them... - Mother! Oh my goodness! You'll get burned! Come on! Look at the flame! - Oh, the bamboo... - Oh no! - Oh, no... - What's happening to us? You're burning our land! This cannot be... - Sir, please... - Sir... Where are you going? It's hot! Let me die! I can't live without him! Hot! Who's that? There was a man in the bamboo grove. - Hey! - What is that? Oh... My... There was a man? Really? Does anyone know who he is? Who is he? See? I told you Sawol had a man. No one? Why are you looking at me? I don't know him. Why are you looking at me? You think Sawol slept with him, is that it? I'll bring Sawol and get to the bottom of this. Stay right there! Bring the body and investigate this thoroughly! Yes, sir. Sawol! Sawol! What... Why... How could you... You should've at least cleared your name! Stupid... Isn't he the new servant in our house? He's dead now. Dead as a doornail. You ingrates... You should've turned yourself in... But it's too late now. It's too late. It's too late! It's too late now. I am so sorry. Thank you. Translation by Alyssa Kim. Editing by Paul Tewkesbury
