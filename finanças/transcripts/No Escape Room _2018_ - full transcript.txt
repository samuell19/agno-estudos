(POP MUSIC ON HEADPHONES) (INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) MICHAEL: Karen? Karen? Hey, Karen, come on. What, dad? Can you just talk to me for a minute? How is, uh, how is school going? (SCOFFS) It's great, dad. Best thing ever. Okay. (CHUCKLES) Um, how'd that paper turn out? What paper? What are you talking about? Uh, the one you wrote with the, the painter lady. - You mean, Emily Dickinson? - Yeah. Yeah. She's a poet, dad, not a painter. That was, like, three weeks ago. Do you think I could read it? What? No, dad, that's weird. (THUNDER RUMBLING) You don't wear that necklace I got you. I-I thought you liked it. (SIGHS) I know you're upset. I'm not upset, dad. It's horseback riding, not a trip to Paris. I'm gonna make it up to you. I said I'm not upset, okay? I don't even care. (ENGINE SPUTTERING) - Dad? - Uh, i-it's, it's fine. It'll-it'll be fine. (INSTENSE MUSIC) (MICHAEL SIGHS) Oh, shit. Hey, honey? (POP MUSIC ON HEADPHONES) (CELL PHONE KEYS CLACKING) MICHAEL: Karen? Hey, hon? Karen? - Karen! - What, dad? There should be some old rags in the trunk. Could you grab me one, please? (POP MUSIC ON HEADPHONES) Thanks, kiddo. - (TRUCK HONKING) - Karen! Dad! What the hell? That cell phone! You could've been killed! What are you talking about? God. KAREN: So how long until the car is fixed? Oh, the guy from the garage said it won't be done till the end of the day. (SIGHS) Great. We'll find something else to do. - It's not a big deal. - No, it is a big deal. We only get one weekend out of the months together and I'm, like, striking out all over the place here. What's there to do around here? Um... Well, let's take a look. Okay, we've got... Oh, we've got bowling, we've got, oh, mini-golf. That sounds like a lot of... N-no fun at all. We have movies, we have kids' theater... Wait. Wait a second. What about this? Escape Rooms. You've been talking about these things, right? You said you wanted to try one. Nicole and some friends did one a while back. Sounded cool. Well, okay. I'm on board with cool. Dad, that one was in San Francisco. Out here, wherever we are, it's probably in some creepy guy's garage or worse. Well, we won't know until we try, will we? - (SIGHS) - Hm? Huh? Uh, excuse me. - We doing all right over here? - MICHAEL: Uh, yeah. We're great. Thank you. We were just wondering... how do we get to this place? You don't go to that place. Why not? That place... A lot of bad things have happened there over the years. What do you mean? I can't really say. Just... You hear a lot of stories. Stuff that don't make much sense. All I know is, a lot of people go up there and you never hear from them again. (LAUGHING) Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, I can never keep a straight face. I'm just messing with you. No, you take it from me, you go up there, you're gonna have one hell of a time. Just tell 'em Betsy sent you. Okay, now we have to go. For Betsy. Fine. (CHUCKLES) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) KAREN: Wow, that's so cute. What are you talking about? (LIGHTS FLICKERING) (INSTENSE MUSIC) - (CLATTERS) - (GASPS) (COIN CLINKING) (INDISTINCT WHISPERING) (MUSIC CONTINUES) - (DOOR THUDS) - (GASPS) Sorry. (DOOR OPENS) (DOOR SHUTS) MICHAEL: Karen, let's go. Seriously? Just give me a minute. - What exactly is an escape room? - It's a game, dad. MICHAEL: They just, like, lock you up in a room, and that's it? KAREN: No, they give you clues to solve and then you try to figure out how to escape. MICHAEL: Oh. - (KAREN SIGHS) - You ready? Yeah. (CROW CAWING) Why didn't you just have them pull up to the door? It's more money. Plus, cardio. KAREN: Oh, my God. (EERIE MUSIC) KAREN: So this is the place? MICHAEL: Yeah, it has to be. KAREN: Looks really popular. - Come on. - Mm... (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Hello? Maybe it's closed. - (SIGHS) Maybe I didn't... - (DOOR OPENING) (DOOR CREAKING) (INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC ON STEREO) MICHAEL: Hello? (CREAKING) Anyone here? (MUSIC CONTINUES) We're, uh... here to escape, I guess. Hey, hon? - Stay close. - Mm-hmm. How did you get in here? What do you want? Hey, what the hell? What are you talking about? It's you. Thank God you came. It's me, Josie. Surely you remember me. Please hurry. The others are waiting. We haven't much time. She's pretty good. Yeah. (MUSIC CONTINUES) - Hey. Melanie. - Hi. Uh, this is Tyler. - First time? - Yeah, yeah. Oh, I'm Michael. This is my daughter, Karen. Is this your first time? No, I've done these before. He only let me drag him along because it's my birthday. MICHAEL: Happy birthday. How about you? Are you here alone? No, well, I'm a plant. I'm with the Escape Room. Really? No. Why would I tell you that? (CHUCKLES) JOSIE: Apologies. I don't have much more to give you. I rarely get visitors anymore. Few have dared to come since the disappearances. For you. TYLER: Thank you. Oh. Thank you. I don't know why you look so confused. Perhaps this will help to clear your mind and prepare you for what is to come. - No, no, don't. - Dad... We don't even know what's in this. (SLURPING) - Chai tea. Not bad. - And what? JOSIE: I've taken the liberty of drawing up contracts for each of you. Apologies if it seems unusual. But the authorities will require some proof that you are willing participants in case anything should happen to you. Oh. What is this? It's a waiver. Pretty customary. Just a little dressed up for the occasion. - Your contraptions, miss. - (GASPS) My what? I don't mean to cast dispersions, but some have tried to smuggle in their devices in order to record what they see inside the house in a misguided attempt to share its secrets with the world. That's pretty impressive, Josie, I can't get her to shut that thing off for more than five minutes. - Excuse me. - Mm... - Uh, no. I need this. - MELANIE: Ty. JOSIE: There are no gadgets that can help you in here. To get out of the house, you need to rely on your wit and one another. - Mm. - Tyler. Okay. There you go, all right? - (WHISPERING) Thank you. - Mwah. (GEAR MECHANISM WHIRRING) JOSIE: Sometime ago, strange occurrences began to plague the surrounding townships. People who lived there claimed to see things that simply could not be, things that should've remained confined to dreams and nightmares. The church blamed black magic, the devil's work. Doctors feared an outbreak of some kind, a disease of the mind. But it was discovered that the cause of these events lie here within these walls. An inventor lived here, a recluse, who came to test theories, theories that were rejected by the outside world. The town sent five people to put a stop to the inventor's experiments, and were never heard from again. It is your job to find what happened to these people who went missing and help them escape the house. There will be a key hidden in each room to help you along the way. But you will only have one hour to complete your task before the forces lurking within the house drive you mad. If at any point you cannot continue, simply speak the word, "Awake," and you shall be freed from the house. But I must warn you, you may not be prepared for everything it has to show you. (INSTENSE MUSIC) (MICHAEL SIGHS) Okay, that was weird. (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) TYLER: This isn't gonna be really scary, is it? MELANIE: No, this is going to be fun. (DOOR SHUTS) (GRUNTING) (SIGHS) It's locked. - So what do we do now? - (TIMER BEEPING) We play. Stop standing around and start looking for clues. Okay. What exactly does a clue look like? It could be anything that looks out of place. It all looks out of place. (INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) "Aya... Ayawask?" (CHUCKLES) Close. Ayahuasca. It's a, um, tea Shamans used to drink to speak to the other world. South-American thing. - I travel a lot. - Mm... South American? - Yeah. - Like those masks over there. - Like those masks. - This is, uh, this is cool, huh? I guess, yeah. So what do you think this, uh, this inventor was up to here? Probably inventing. (CHUCKLING) TYLER: Find anything yet? Clues? Look, can you just assume you're gonna be here for the next 60 minutes, and relax? - Your e-mails can wait. - All right. Mine's a dud. You got anything good in there? Uh, yeah. Only my favorite band of all time. - Oh, my. - Mm-hmm. I've got their Greatest Hits. - Really? - No. - They don't have Greatest Hits. - (CHUCKLES) No, no, no, don't put it back. We gotta listen to it now. - It could have a clue in it. - KAREN: Okay. ANDREW: Over there. Here we go. (INDISTINCT SONG ON GRAMOPHONE) Okay, I'm sorry, that's terrible. Yes, it is. Wait, wait, wait, hang on. - What? - Listen. No, he's right. She's singing about a-a snake and a raven. Yeah. And so? Look at the masks. Okay, babe, these are out of order. It has to be snake... (GEAR MECHANISM WHIRRING) Now raven... The wolf and... the pig. (CREAKING) - TYLER: Look. - (MELANIE CHUCKLES) MICHAEL: There it is. Great job, hon. Uh, Karen. Well, fun's not over yet. Now we gotta find the combination. - Really? - Tyler. Uh... Hm. So we're looking for numbers. Yeah, but it might be something that we're supposed to count. Stuffs that's all the same color. I don't know. (EERIE MUSIC) (TYLER SIGHS) (INDISTINCT CHATTER) Whoa. Trippy. (BREATHING HEAVILY) (LOW GROWLING) (MUSIC CONTINUES) - Melanie! - Tyler! - ANDREW: Are you hurt? - No, no, I'm fine. - Did nobody else see that? - See what? Nice, try, Ty. Not leaving... No, I'm not trying to get out... I think I, uh, I had too much of that tea. You're probably right. These places are designed to get you to jump at your own shadows, man. I wouldn't worry about it. To put ideas in your head and stuff. - It's probably that movie. - Mm-hmm. Thanks. ANDREW: Mm. MELANIE: Babe. You're not gonna make this like the haunted mansion last time. - I mean, are you? - No, no, no. You stepped on a bowl of Jell-O and gummy worms. Screamed and left in under ten minutes. You know, you know, I don't even wanna like this crap. Okay? But I'm here. Okay? Look, look, I'm here, right? I'm here and we're looking for clues. Just... Let's just find the clues, huh? (INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) Hey, guys. Look at the masks. Numbers. Is that the combination? It's gotta be. Lift up that mask on the end. - Yeah. - Uh-huh. - You're ready? - Ready. - Thirteen. - Yeah. MICHAEL: Eight. Seven. Eighteen. (SAFE UNLOCKS) - Boom! Done. - (CHUCKLES) How are we doing now, Melanie? - Back on track. - Nice. - Good job, hon. - TYLER: Ah! Careful. You might see the boogeyman. (INSTENSE MUSIC) Another room. I thought it was Escape Room, not rooms. - Tyler. - (CLOCKS TICKING) - (DOOR SHUTS) - (GASPS) (TIMER BEEPING) Okay, guys, we're looking good. We still have 50 minutes left. MICHAEL: But we haven't found anyone yet. MELANIE: Be patient. There are a lot of clocks in this place. Maybe they have something to do with what the inventor was up to? You know, this, um, ahem, inventor wasn't a real guy, right? Thank you. KAREN: Look at you, getting all into this. (CHUCKLING) - It's fun, huh? - Yeah. Dad, check this out. (EERIE MUSIC) MICHAEL: It is cool. How does it do that? (LINE RINGING) Hey, guys, it's ringing. Babe, order me a pizza. I'm getting hungry. Only if you want a dead delivery man. - That's not funny. - Wait, what do you mean? MELANIE: Our inventor was using these devices to communicate to the other side. I'm starting to see a theme here. Huh? It's like the last room. Our hostess said that the inventor was trying to communicate with the dead. In the last room we had the ayahuasca tea. In this room we have these devices. - It's the same thing. - So is that a clue? Or just a really good atmosphere. - I think I can hear somebody. - What are they saying? I'm not sure, I can barely make it out. Hello? Guys. I can hear somebody. MELANIE: Hello? MELANIE: (ON PHONE) Hello? - It sounds like... - It sounds like... It's just a gag, it's recording my voice and playing it back to me, but I don't know... MELANIE: (ON PHONE) You don't know what this means. You don't know what any of this means. - Melanie, what is it? - Shh! WOMAN: (ON PHONE) He's there now, isn't he? Let me speak to him? Um... I think it's for you. It's my voice, but they're messing with it or something. She's asking for you. Maybe it's a clue? - No. - Ty. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Just... Happy birthday. - Hello? - MELANIE: (ON PHONE) Ty... Ty, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. - Melanie, this isn't funny. - That's not me, I swear. It's not me, Ty. - It's not me. - What? You just have to get outta there. - What are you... - Just run! - What? - Ty, just run! God! Tyler, your ear! (INSTENSE MUSIC) MELANIE: Tyler! TYLER: It's damn worms! - Worms in my ears! Shit! - MELANIE: It's fake blood, Ty. No. No, no, no. Get 'em off me. Get 'em, get... It's just a trick. It's just a prank. No, no, no. I, I know! I know what I saw! - Ty. - Okay? Hey, I know what I saw. - They're just trying to scare... - Listen. Listen! - I know what I saw! - MELANIE: It's not real, Ty. Okay. No, you know what? I'm... I tried. You know, I'm trying here. But, like, I'm not having any fun. This is great. You guys are super into it. But now I wanna, I wanna, I wanna leave. I'm done. Can you let me out? You guys listening? What's the, what's the, uh... Aw-aw-awake! - Ty. - Okay? Aw-awake. Awake! Awake! Ty! Ty! - (DOOR SLAMS) - Ty, it's my birthday! (SIGHS) Ty. Dammit. I can't believe he bailed on me. Maybe they can pause the game and you can go talk to him. No, it's fine. He always does this. He's all excited to do it and then freaks out as soon as it starts getting difficult. MICHAEL: He looked pretty shook up to me. He said he saw worms. MELANIE: There's no worms. He's just being dramatic. Hey, maybe they did spike that tea. No. No, that would be against, like, a dozen laws. You don't know what you signed in that waiver. Did you read it? - Are you guys being serious? - Did you see that tea? They're running a business here. They're not gonna drug us. He just gets paranoid. That's all. Okay. What about the movie that they showed us? Maybe there's something in the subliminal messages of that. Yeah. Do you know something you're not telling us? Yeah. I know all the secrets of this house. Yeah. I'm on their payroll. That's why I'm telling you all of this right now. Okay. Come on, really? Look at the time. Are we playing or aren't we? Okay. So why are you here... alone? (CHUCKLES) Doctor's suggestions. Mm. My shrink seems to think that I need to do more character-building exercises with strangers. So, uh... how am I doing? Not great. (CHUCKLES) Shit. I thought I was doing pretty good. Think again, buddy. Okay, you don't have to get mean about it. Hey, guys. Look at the typewriter. All the keys are out of order. That's it. It must be a cypher. W-we just have to figure out what we're supposed to type into this thing. - ANDREW: Do you see anything? - KAREN: Wait. How long have we been here, like, in this room? Uh, five, ten minutes. So that clock's broken. The hands haven't moved since we got here. They're stuck at... stuck at 10:12. - 10:12. - Wait. That's genius. It's a four-digit number. I mean, who needs Tyler? You're my new partner. The radio. Wait, you think that the four-digit number is a radio station? Yeah. Hey, tune in to 101... - Two. - 101.2. (RADIO STATIC) MAN: (ON RADIO) Z, F. - We have to type. - Yeah, I'm on it. - Z, F... - MAN: (ON RADIO) K, L... - B, D... - MICHAEL: D... - J, U... - J. - Good job. - Thank you. - Z, H, D, Q... - Z, H... - Q, F, W, X... - Q... F, A, R, U... - ANDREW: Top. Top. - Thank you. "Five lost from... midnight." The five missing people? (SIGHS) Maybe we're just complicating it. - What do you mean? - (CLEARS THROAT) Um... No, five lost from midnight. (KAREN SCOFFS) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (GEAR MECHANISM WHIRRING) (GASPS) MICHAEL: Nice. ANDREW: Okay. MICHAEL: Let's find a door for your key. - Take this one first? - ANDREW: Yeah. - Anything? - (SIGHS) No, nothing. There's one over here. Nice. - (DOOR KNOB RATTLING) - Nothing? - Nope. - Last one. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) All right, what do we have in here? MICHAEL: What is it? A closet. Just a closet. MELANIE: Not just a closet. Everything in here's on purpose. - It's also just a closet. - (KAREN SIGHS) No, there's gotta be something in there. Yeah, okay. Well, be my guest. It smells like mothballs there. No, wait till you get one of the other doors to open. Well, how are we supposed to find anything in all this crap? Let me see. Check everywhere. You know what, I think I feel something. What is it, Karen? Um, it's, it's wet. - (SCREAMS) - (INSTENSE MUSIC) Whoa-whoa! Jesus! Okay. That, yeah, that got me. - Dad! - What? - (WHISPERING) Help me. - MICHAEL: Help you? What do you mean, help you? This is part of the game, right? - Help me. - KAREN: Dad. (WHISPERING) Help me. (WHISPERING) Okay, what's happening here? Oh, this game is awesome. KAREN: Oh, my God. Dad, is she really bleeding? Hey, guys, um, I think she's really hurt. MICHAEL: Yeah, she's bleeding pretty bad. Oh, yeah, right. Um... Hey, can you tell us, um, what happened? - Who did this to you? - MICHAEL: Knock it off. Okay? She's not... (MUMBLES) She's, she's not... - She's not what? - JOSIE: It was... You guys are gullible. JOSIE: It was... the inventor. - What do you mean? - The inventor. He's here... inside the house. You'll have to get out before he turns up or you'll never... escape. (PANTING) Oh, my God. This, this is crazy. She's delirious. She's not delirious, she's reading lines. Find the master key. Oh, you guys heard her. You have to find the master key. - She's dead. - MELANIE: Yeah. I thought she oversold a little bit, but... Yeah, we're not getting anything further out of her, so we better start looking for that key. Are you nuts? Did you see her? That's make-up and prosthetics. None of that stuff was real... Well, if she was fakin' it, she was doing a hell of a job. That's it. I'm putting a stop to this right now. - Awake! - What are you doing? MICHAEL: Awake, damn it! MELANIE: What are you doing? - MICHAEL: Awake! - This is brilliant! - Why are you ruining it? - Come on! - Does this happen? - Does what happen? MICHAEL: The safe word. Do they just ignore it? - Are we trapped in here? - Tyler got out. - Did he, though? - (DOOR KNOB RATTLING) MELANIE: What are you saying? Well, what is that supposed to mean? I don't know, dad. We didn't see anybody else. That Josie girl... maybe she had to go back to the desk. Go back to the desk? In her condition? ANDREW: So let me get this straight. Someone invaded the Escape Room, killed our hostess and locked us in. Yeah. Okay. That's possible. (TIMER BEEPING) KAREN: It can't be a coincidence, dad. The door slamming right before we could make sure if she was actually dead? I was sure. Well, if it is just a game, what do we do next? I think it's safe to assume that that key was only supposed to get us into the closet so that we found the dead girl. So if it's not doors that we're supposed to be opening, there's gotta be another way out of here. (SIGHS) Problem is, it's not big enough for any of us to fit through. I could do it. What? No. - No way. - Dad, we have to try something. Well, let's try something else, you're not going out there alone. (SCOFFS) I can handle it. Dad, I can handle it. Look, I'll be on the other side of the door and I'll talk to you the whole time. Look, we all wanna get out of here, okay? We have to try. I can do it. It's just a game, dad. KAREN: Okay. And up. Okay. - You good? - Yeah. - Okay. - You okay? - KAREN: Yeah. - Be careful. You all right? Karen, are you okay? - Karen? - I'm okay. MELANIE: Can you see anything over there? What about Tyler? Is he out there? It's just another hallway. And a window with bars on it. KAREN: It still won't open. Take a look around, everywhere. (EERIE MUSIC) Karen? Karen? Do you see anything? Karen? Karen? - (SCREAMS) - Karen? Karen? Karen! - JOSIE: Karen? - Josie? - JOSIE: Come with me. - Josie! - MICHAEL: Karen! - I know that was you. KAREN: Dad, Josie's here. She's fine. Josie, we're done with the games. Help me with this. Let's go. Come on. - (GRUNTS) Stand back. - Come on. Josie? - On three. - One... - Two, three. - Two, three. - One, two, three. - One, two, three. (BOTH GRUNTING) (EERIE MUSIC) Josie? (INDISTINCT WHISPERING) Hello? - One, two, three. - One, two, three. How is this still standing? JOSIE: This way. (INDISTINCT WHISPERING) - (DOOR SHUTS) - Wait! (GEAR MECHANISM RATTLING) It just opened. Let's go. Karen? (INDISTINCT WHISPERING) KAREN: Please. Hello? Josie? (INDISTINCT WHISPERING) - JOSIE: Find the master key. - Josie? (INDISTINCT WHISPERING) (GASPS) (SIGHS) (BREATHING HEAVILY) (LOW GROWLING) JOSIE: It's me. Josie. Surely you remember me. - (GASPS) - (DOOR THUDDING) No. (GASPING) - (MUMBLES) - (DOOR SHUTS) (INSTENSE MUSIC) (SCREAMS) (BREATHING HEAVILY) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Check every door. Please. Karen? - MICHAEL: Karen. - Ty. This isn't funny anymore! MELANIE: Ty, are you out here? ANDREW: These are not gonna budge. Karen! This isn't funny! (SHUDDERING) - (THUDDING) - (GASPS) Karen? This place is amazing. (GRUNTS) MICHAEL: Karen! (POUNDING ON DOOR) (LOW GROWLING) (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) (LOW GROWLING) (GROWLING CONTINUES) (POUNDING ON DOOR) (POUNDING CONTINUES) (GROWLING) (PROJECTOR WHIRRING) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (GEAR MECHANISM WHIRRING) (GEAR MECHANISM WHIRRING) - Door! - (DOOR SLAMS) Can we at least remember to prop the doors open from now on? (PROJECTOR WHIRRING) MICHAEL: What the hell room is this? (SIGHS) Does it matter anymore? (TIMER BEEPING) - Game is still on. - MICHAEL: Oh, yeah? So all of this is still part of it? - The clock is still ticking. - To what? Man. This place gets crazier every second. Oh, we've seen this one before. Maybe they're trying to tell us something. No. They're just screwing with us. Hey, that was on for a reason. Yeah, well, it's giving me a headache, okay? I'm not just gonna sit around here piecing together clues while my daughter is missing in this house somewhere. Well, unless you know another way outta here, you don't have a choice. Like it or not, we've to play the game. That's gonna drive me nuts. (LOW GROWLING) (BREATHING HEAVILY) (CHAINS CLANKING) (LOW GROWLING) (GROWLING) Hm. Found a lock. (SIGHS) So we're looking for numbers. You know what, this projector was on when we came in. So, obviously, they want us to pay attention to it. Do you think the combination might be on the reel? Could be. There's two of them. Here's another. This is so weird. (GASPS) Okay. Okay, here we go. (PROJECTOR WHIRRING) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Can you make any of that out? No. (BREATHING HEAVILY) (CLATTERING) (SHUDDERING) (SNIFFLES) (BREATHING HEAVILY) Awake. Awake. Awake. Awake. Awake. (PROJECTOR WHIRRING) Does that projector move? - No? I need, um, um... - No. - Uh, a mirror. I need a mirror. - What are you talking about? I, uh, subbed for this physics teacher at the school that I work at. He did this trick. If you point a strobe light at a moving fan, it makes it look like it's standing still. There might be something on those fan blades we need to see. Got it. I got it. - MICHAEL: Got it? - Yeah. MELANIE: They're numbers. There they are. - You ready? - Yeah. - Seven. - MICHAEL: Yeah. Three. - Eight. - Wait. Wait. - Eight? - Yeah. - MICHAEL: Okay. - Two. Well, let's get the hell out of here. Let's go. MICHAEL: Melanie, let's go. MELANIE: Hey, guys, are you seeing this? Come on. Hurry up! What is this? (DRAMATIC MUSIC) That, that's me. MICHAEL: Hurry up! Melanie, come on. Hurry the hell up! - (DOOR SHUTS) - Shit! Melanie! Melanie! What is this? (INDISTINCT WHISPERING) Okay, this is good. This is really good. Okay. (GASPING) (BREATHING HEAVILY) Guys? (BREATHING HEAVILY) Well, what's she doing? We left the key right there in the lock. What the... Tell me you have nothing to do with this. What are you talking about? You seem to know an awful lot about these rooms. You solved more of them than I have. Nothing fazes you. What are you doing... Get the hell off me! MELANIE: Michael? Andrew! Guys, answer me! (GASPS) (SCREAMS) Oh! (SOBBING) Ty! Oh, God, Ty, I'm sorry. This is happening. (SOBBING) (MELANIE SCREAMS) (TELEPHONE RINGING) KAREN: Awake. Awake. (SNIFFLES) (THUDDING) (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) (KAREN GASPS) (INSTENSE MUSIC) - (KAREN SCREAMING) - Karen! - Karen! Oh, my God. - Oh. Oh, my God. Andrew. - It's okay. It's okay. - (KAREN PANTING) It's all right. It's okay. Come here. Oh, my God, Karen. What are you doing here, huh? - Are you okay? - KAREN: Yeah. (PANTING) Where's my dad? What's happening to us? I don't know. I really don't know. You didn't see anybody else out there? No, nothing. I thought I saw Josie, but then I didn't. This place is playing tricks on us. No. No, there's somebody else here. Something. I think it killed Josie for real. I think it's trying to kill us. Josie said the inventor's back. What did she mean by that? I don't know. I don't know, Karen. (GRUNTING) (GRUNTS) Come on. (GRUNTS) Why are you all alone? Huh? How did you find me? I heard your scream. - You are alone? - Yeah. Karen, what are you getting at? Where is my dad, Andrew? Karen, we split up to come and find you. And then I heard you screaming. Uh... Look at me. This is just a game, okay? It's nothing but a sick, twisted game. None of this stuff is real. Karen, there is a perfectly good explanation for all of these things. We're gonna get through this, okay? - (TELEPHONE RINGING) - (MELANIE PANTING) (TELEPHONE RINGING) MELANIE: (ON PHONE) Hello? - Hello? - It sounds like... Sounds like... It's just a gag, it's recording my voice and playing it back to me, but I don't know... You don't know what this means. You don't know what any of this means. TYLER: Melanie, what is it? He's there now, isn't he? Let me speak to him? TYLER: Hello? Ty! Oh, Ty... Ty, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. TYLER: This isn't funny. MELANIE: That's not me. It's not me, Ty. It's not me.
