Hey, hey, Betty, Wilma. Why, Barney, you look exhausted. I, I always look this way after ridin' in the Indianapolis Rock 500. - What do you mean, Barney? - Fred drove home. Oh, I don't know what the doctor told him but he's sure actin' strange. The doctor probably told Freddy had a rash. [laughs] Men can be such little boys at times. [laughs] You can say that again. Come along, Pebbles and Dino. Let's go home. [barking] crash Yoohoo. Fred. We're home. Fred! Where are you? [sniffing] [barking] Fred, are you in there? (Fred) 'No, go away.' - 'Fred!' - Hi, Wilma. What in the world are you doing in the closet holding your fishing pole and bowling ball? People spend fortunes on hot tubs to sit in. Why can't I sit in my own closet? - 'It's a lot cheaper.' - Oh, I see. Um, how did the checkup go? Uh, the doc said I'm fine. Uh, no problem. Now would you please close the door? You're letting the light in. Well, alright, if you say so. Wonder if this could be the midlife cris? [laughs] [Dino barking] I wanna be alone, Dino. Twenty four hours. Why me? Why couldn't it be Barney? Hey, what am I sayin'? Wait a minute, that's it. I'll tell Barney. - 'What?' - 'That's right, Barn.' Twenty four hours. Give or take a few minutes. Oh, golly, buddy. I, I don't know what to say. Oh, th-th-this is awful. Now, Barn old pal, you gotta be strong. - Okay, I'll, I'll try. - Attaboy. - Hey, say, Fred. - Yeah, little chum. Can, can I have your new fishing pole? What? Why, you-- [laughing] I was only kiddin', Fred. Hey, hey, look, pal. You can rest in peace. I mean, uh, rest assured. I'll-I'll-I'll rember all the nice things that you've done for me. Oh, thanks, Barn. Oh, yeah, like, like, uh-- - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Uh, well, like, uh-- Hold it, Barn, I think you've just hit on something. (Barney) 'Huh?' What will anybody remember me for? Yeah, yeah, th-that's a tough one, Fred. Look at Wilma over there. 'She's always workin' her fingers to the bone for me.' 'And tell me, what do I do for her?' (Barney) 'Uh, nothin'.' (Fred) 'And look at little Pebbles and Dino.' 'What little extra things have I done for them?' (Barney) Uh, likewise. Yeah, I-I haven't bought either of them a toy in ages. Hey, uh, we can all remember you for doin' nothin'. Oh, no, Barn, that's all gonna change. - It is? - You bet. Come with me. Here, pal, take my new fishing pole. Oh, gee, thanks, Fred. It's alright. Here's my bowlin' bowl. Wow! Hey, Fred, how about your new golf clubs? What? Why, you.. Yeah, why not? [laughs] - Here. - Gee, thanks. And, and what time is it, Barney? It's about, uh, uh, quarter past three, Fred. I'll see you later, little chum. I've got things to do. Yeah, okay, pal. Hmm, I wonder what else he's got I could use. [laughs] [babbling] [barking] Hey, little sweetheart. Has daddy told you lately that he loves you? [laughs] And that goes for you too, Dino. Yuck! [laughs]Fred. [laughs] Hey, you beautiful, don't go away. I'll be right back. Where are you going, Fred? That's for me to know and you to find out. Yabba dabba doo! Oh, my goodness, I haven't seen Fred in such a happy mood for years. And such a generous one too. Oh, I gotta get this stuff home before he changes his mind. [laughs] (Wilma) 'Honestly, Betty, Fred actually swept me off my feet.' I don't know what got into him. Well, whatever it is, I wish it would rub off on Barney. I can't imagine where he was going in such a hurry. cough cough Oh, dear, there goes the garbage disposal acting up again. cough cough (Betty) 'You're about due for a new disposal, aren't you, Wilma?' burp Well, you know Fred. He's a do-it-yourself, fix-it-up man if he ever gets around to it. screech (Fred) 'Wilma, Pebbles, Dino!' [both gasping] [honking] Whoa! That's some snazzy new convertible, Fred. And I like your new outfit. Fred, what on earth's going on? Merry Christmas, sweetheart! It's all yours. A car, a new garbage disposal and a new vacuum sweeper. But, Fred, it isn't Christmas. It is as far as I'm concerned. Here, sweetie, this is for you from daddy. Oh, Dad Claus, Dad Claus. [laughing] (Fred) 'And here's a king-size bone for you, Dino old pal.' Well, how do you like the new outfit, Barn? Gee, Fred, if I didn't know better I'd think you were a famous rock star. Remember Barn, not a word about you-know-what to anyone. Oh, I got you, buddy, not a word. I've never seen so many presents. Fred Flintstone, where do you plan to get the money to pay for all this? Well, yeah, Fred, you gonna cash in a life insurance policy? [laughing] P-p-policy. O-o-oops. Oh, yeah, yours. Uh, slip of the lip, Fred, uh, slip of the lip. Yeah, sorry, Barney. - Hey, what time is it? - About, uh, six o'clock, buddy. Thank you, Barn. I'm gonna make each minute count. Come on, Wilma, slip into this new evenin' dress and call a babysitter. The Flintstones and the Rubbles are goin' out for a night on the town. And Freddy boy's pickin' up the tab. - Whee! - Gee, thanks, pal. Yes, sir, Barn old chump This convertible is fully automatic. Hey, wanna see the top go up? - Sure, buddy, I'm dying to. - 'Huh?' I-I mean, yeah, sure, sure. Hmm. - We're on, Chumsy. - Gotcha. Gee, that's great, Fred. What will they think of next? And it's not all, gang, it goes down automatically too. Watch. Well, how about that? - Fantastic. - What a car. I feel just like a movie star. [laughs] Me too. Oh, Fred, would it be too much to ask where we're going? Where else, Wilma baby, but to the La Coo Coo Rocko Bedrock's finest Mexican restaurant. Hey, how about that?Ole! [instrumental music] Ole! - Marvelous. - Bravo! Bravo! Yeah, with hot sauce on it. Oh, Fred, the meal was delicious and the music was delightful. It's just like old times. Yeah. Oh, boy, am I stuffed? Another corn chip and I die. Oops. Uh-uh-uh, a slip of the tongue, Fred. A slip of the tongue. How would you like a slip of my fist? Say, what time is it now, Barn? (Barney) 'Oh, it's about 9 o'clock.' Come on, Wilma, let's dance. But, Fred, you don't like to dance.

Barney, let me save your feet the trouble. [clock chimes] (Wilma) 'Oh, my goodness. It's after 12:00.' (Fred) '12:00? Is that all?' Come on, gang, anyone for roller skatin'? - Roller skating? - Roller skating? It's been years since I've been on roller skates. Me too. I feel like a young girl again. Come on, Fred, stand up. This was your idea. Oh, I've never been on roller skates before, Barn. I'm only doin' it for Wilma. I gotta make every minute count. Well, if you wanna learn fast, there's only one way. Yaw! Whoa! Whoa! Hey, look, Barn, I'm skatin', I'm skatin'. [laughs] I believe he's got it. Why, Fred, you're a terrific skater. How about that, Wilma? From a cheapskater to roller skater. [laughing] - Oh, I'm tired. - Oh, yeah, me too. Well, how about it, neighbors? Isn't this a ball? A roller ball? [laughing] Okay, come on, Fred, we-we're pooped. When are you gonna call it quits? - Oops. - Call it quits? [disco music] Hey, look alive, group. It's disco time! - Disco time? - Disco time?

This is my own bedroom. screech Wilma, Betty, Barney, what time is it? Now, now, calm down, dear, take it easy. It's okay, Fred. It's five o'clock in the afternoon. Huh? Five o'clock. We let you sleep in, Fred. You were dead to the world, oops. [laughing] I soon will be. My 24 hours are up. Wilma, I've gotta talk fast. I've gotta tell you something. Fred, you've got a lot of 24 hours left. Huh? I have? While you were sleeping, the doctor called. Oh, yeah, there was mix-up in the X-rays, Fred. A mix-up? You mean, I'm not loaded with faulty plumbin'? The nurse mixed up your X-ray with Mr. Frankenstone's. And faulty plumbing is perfectly normal for him. You mean, you mean I'm okay? I'm not gonna you-know-what? - Oh, you're fine, Fred. - A-Okay. Oh, you old sweetheart. You didn't wanna worry us. You kept this to yourself and just wanted to show me a good time. Oh, Fred! mwah Yeah, the things I should have been doin' all the time. Hey, this calls for a celebration. 'Wilma, call a babysitter.' 'We're all goin' out in the town.' - Oh, no, not again. - Oh, no. [disco music] Hey,senorita, haven't I seen you around here before? [laughs] Oh, Fred! Barney, why the long face? Fred is going to be alright. Yeah, but, uh, it just dawned on me. I'm gonna have to give him back his bowling ball and his fishing pole. - Oh, Barney. - I'm just kidding, Betty. You know, Fred, when I dance with you it's, oh, it's like we're in heaven. Oops, sorry. That's okay, honey. Yeah, we must be. - I've got an angel in my arms. - Oh, Fred. [laughing] Yabba dabba doo! mwah [theme music]
