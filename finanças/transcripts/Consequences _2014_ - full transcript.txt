Who is it? Cenk, it's me. Ece? Welcome back. What's going on? Nothing is going on. And nothing will be. Why did you come back, Cenk? Why now? Why not earlier, or later? Huh? What can I say? Cenk. You don't know why you've come back now? Go away, Cenk. Why don't you go now? Go. Ece, stop. Calm down. Come on. -Ece, calm down. -Cenk. Ece, shush. Someone is inside. What? How come? I saw you, come out. Bro. I needed something. Who the hell are you? What's going on? What are you doing here? -Nothing. -Were you watching us? -No, really. -How did you get in here? -Through the door. -Cenk, call the cops. Let's not call the cops. I should better go. -Did you film us or something? -No way. I swear we're not burglars. We left something here and I came back to get it. -What did you leave? Tell me. -Check his cell phone Cenk. -Take his cell. -Ece, I didn't see anything. -Really, I didn't see a thing. -What Ece are you talking about? -Give me your cell phone. -Bro, I swear...

Nothing to worry, it's over. -Are you all right? -He fell really hard. -Tell me, are you all right? -He fell really bad. All right, I'll take a look. Now put your clothes on. There's blood on his head. Maybe his neck is broken. Jesus, stop panicking. Let's call an ambulance. He hit his head, you didn't see it. He hit it really hard. Cenk, is he breathing? -Cenk, is he breathing? -Yes. He is alive. Calm down. We will call the cops. We will explain them. What are we going to tell them? We'll tell them he broke in, he is a burglar, and he attacked us. What else? Ece look at me, you're leaving now, okay? -What? How? -Simple, you're leaving now. -Let's call some people. -I will take care of everything Should we call Faruk? Do you think the boy might have filmed us? Should we call Faruk? What are you talking about? Take your purse, go on, take it. First zip it up, zip it up, zip it up. It's zipped all right. Come over here. Let me see. -Cenk call the ambulance. -Come here. I will call the ambulance right away, but first you got to leave. Please. Let's wrap something around head. I'll take care of it. I am okay. Nothing to worry about. Come slowly I got you into trouble. Don't be silly. It's okay, I'll take care of it. -Jump over. -I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Don't apologize, nothing to be sorry for. -He is alive! -He is alive. He is alive, alright. He is alive. He is breathing, Cenk. Call the cops. I will take care of it right away. Go on. -Do you think he is alright? -Yes. He's alright. -What if something happens? -Ece look at me, nothing will happen. Really. And even if anything happens you shouldn't be here, all right? And the boy didn't have any cell phone, all right? Now go. -Call me, will you? -I will. -Call the ambulance. -I will, I'll call everyone. -How will you go? -My car is in the parking lot. Okay, go, go. -Call me all right? -I will. Okay. Come on. -Go now. -I'm so sorry. Don't be silly. Hello. Faruk. Go somewhere quiet, for heaven's sake. Some guys broke into the apartment, burglars. I'm telling you, they broke in. Easy, all right, calm down. Some burglars broke into the apartment. The guy fell down the stairs. He hit his head on that thing at the entrance, in the corner. We need an ambulance. I'm fine. We need an ambulance. We need to call the cops or something. What's their number? What's that number you call? I'm cool. All right, all right. Call them then. Alright, I'll call you back. Hello! Hello! Hang in there, all right? Who is Merve? What lawyer? Did you call the ambulance? Faruk, hold on. The guy is moving. Hold on. Hello, are you okay? Are you okay? Where is Kýlýç? Tell me where you hurt, come on. Kýlýç. Kýlýç. What Kýlýç? All right wait, let's try this, Let's get you up, all right? Let's get you up. You'll be fine. Here we go, whoops. Hello. Hello. Hello, bro. Shit, man. Cenk. This is Merve. I am coming through the back door. Could you please let me in. The key is in the closet behind the stairs. The bar's closet, on the left. The cabinet at the back? The cabinet on the left. Tough night. Where is he? -He's there by the door. -How is he? -Where's Faruk? -Faruk is on his way. I was nearby. How did this happen? Well, he's probably a burglar. He broke in, he fell down the stairs. -He hit his head right there. -Dear Lord. Did he fall or did you hit him? -What? -Did he fall or did you hit him? I didn't hit him, he rolled down and bust his head. -How did he get in? -I don't know. Good evening, we need an ambulance. But it's very urgent, we have a bleeding patient. -At the Yeralti Mosque. -Faruk said he'd call. -Karakoy Square. -Didn't he call? All right. Merve Sonmez. Did you see my number? Okay, we'll see you in a while. Please hurry. I told him. I told him to call the ambulance. The situation is somehow complicated. -What's complicated? -The building. It's complicated. Should we take him to the hospital? -I tried earlier, couldn't move him. -Should we call a cab? I think we shouldn't move him. He might hurt his neck. All right. Well, why don't you tell me exactly how this happened. Yes, I came home. I saw one of them. Was there someone else with him? Yes, a young boy. He ran away. -I turned around. -Where were you at that moment? I was standing here. The man, was he upstairs? No, I mean I was here when the other one was running away. Then I went upstairs. Faruk. This is bad. It's bad. We need a reliable hospital. I called the ambulance. What did you say them? I hope you didn't give the address. The building shouldn't be involved. I'll handle the hospital. Come on now. Did he have a knife or something in his hand? No, he just jumped on me. All right, we'll say that there is attempted murder. But only if he lives. If he dies... ...then it'll be a murder case against us. What? If there is death, it'll be called murder. And he has an eyewitness but you don't. -But he didn't see anything. -The judge didn't see anything either. In the court, you will say something, the opponent will say the opposite. The judge will look at the evidence. That's what the law is about. Why did I even come here? Is there anything stolen? I don't know what was in the apartment. I just arrived today, I left my luggage. The press conference, the party, and then this. -But in the end it's self-defense, right? -It's not that simple. -Why not? -If it had happened in the bedroom, -but now it's complicated. -But the man attacked me. Well, only you know that. What are we going to do? If I knew exactly what had happened, I could help you one way or another. -You don't have a witness. -The man broke into my apartment. That's the problem. This is not a residential building. Even the electricity is hooked illegally. It doesn't have a permit or anything. Faruk went and started the renovations. He didn't listen to me. He made such fuss about the apartment. He said: "Come on, everything is ready." Don't you know him? That's Faruk for you. He is so excited to see you come back, he cannot think straight. Let's take him. Hold on. Where will we take him? Stop, don't move him. What's going on? -It's bad. -Are you okay? -Why didn't you call the ambulance? -Wait a minute. -Merve, tell me what happened. -The man fell down the stairs, -but it's not very clear how. -What? -He said he hit him, then he didn't. -I didn't hit him. -Wait a minute. -Well, and then? -What do you want me to say? -What's the plan? What are we going to do? -We'll take him to the hospital. -And then what? And then God knows what. If he dies, it'll be a murder case. -No way. -No way, man. Well, that's what I'm saying. -The man broke into the apartment. -All right, what's our plan? -We'll say that he attacked Cenk. -And that's the truth. But it happens the way I'll tell you. We will write the story. -And you'll repeat it word for word. -And then? We'll claim it was in self-defense. And if he lives, we will settle with the man. What do you mean? Of course, he'll live. Jesus! It's not good that it happened here. That's the problem. Did you call the ambulance? -I just did. -Call it again. -I told you I did. -Why don't you call it one more time? -Bro. -Yes? -Are you okay? -I'm fine. What are we going to do? -We're going to fix this. -How? We'll take care of it. Did he have an ID on him? No, he didn't. Good evening. I had called for an ambulance. I've been waiting for quite a while now. This cannot happen here. I'll pick him up. Cenk, get him. Cenk. He can't be here. -What are you talking about? -Grab his feet, come on. -Grab his feet. -Do not move the man. -Don't move the man. What are you doing? -He can't be here. -I tried that. -I can't have a murder in here. Come on, let's carry him. -Come on, move. Move. -Faruk, what are you doing? -Do you take him to the car? -Yeah, right, come on. -You shouldn't have moved him. -Come on now. -Where do you take him? -Just carry on. -Merve, don't stand there. Give us a hand. -Take it easy. -What are you doing, Faruk? -Open the door Merve, Merve. -Take him out. -He won't go through here. -Sure he will. -Don't push. Turn there, go on. Keep walking. -Where is the car? -Be careful. -Where is the car? -Come on, turn. -Now put him down at the corner. -Why don't you tell me where the car is? -Easy, lay him down. All right. -Faruk, what are you doing? -We'll take care of this from here. -The car? -Go lock the door, the shutter. Come on. -Faruk, what are you doing? Okay, listen up. We found him on the street. That's it. Are you crazy? How can he be here? No. I'm telling you, I'll handle this from here. I'll handle this from here. Merve. No, you're getting us all into huge trouble. We can't afford a problem in the building. Where's the car? -How can he be here? -Don't you understand? We can't have a scene. We have to keep the building out of it. You told me that it'll take a week and now it's been five months. You just couldn't get it done. All right I couldn't, but why did you even start the construction? Did I tell you to bring your friend to stay in? Now that we took him outside, would it still be self-defense? What are you talking about? The man is on the street, what self-defense? How? What happened? It's not? Fuck! What fuck? What is it? This is the painter. What painter? He was painting the apartment. Do they have the keys? Do they have the keys? -Do they have the keys? -Faruk, do they have the keys? Do they know you? -Faruk, does he know you? -They know you, don't they? What did you do, Faruk? What did you do? Should we take him back inside? Merve. Merve. Please think of something. For God's sake, think of something. Think of something. Don't force it, we can't turn that corner. We're here. Over here, over here! Turn the siren off. Wait here, we'll get him. I'll go and check on him, so that he doesn't say something wrong. -Good evening. -Did you call? No, she did. How did the accident happen? Well, he was lying in that corner. I guess he hit his head. Merve saw him. We were nearby. We rushed here, right, Merve? She called you. -Could you hurry up a little? -Sir, one moment. We're doing our job. -Do you know him? -No, we don't. -Did he have an ID on him? -We didn't search him. -When did the incident happen? -Should I bring the stretcher for you? Could you hold on for a second? Erdem, scoop stretcher. Sir, we know this guy, he's from the neighborhood. He drinks and causes trouble here and there. When I saw him he told me he tripped or something. You mean he was conscious. Well, when I called you he was still mumbling Which hospital are you taking him? -We'll go to Ilkyardim from here. -Well, let's go to the Memorial. The chief of staff is my friend. I already called him. Why did you say we knew the guy? If it turns out to be a forensic case, we're doomed. So? We'll make a deal with them and it won't turn into a forensic case. -You'll have to pay. -Oh, all right. That is, if he lives. Well, if he dies, we found him on the street. -He wasn't alone. -What? There was another guy with him. -What? -You just don't listen. -Who found these guys? -Cihan. Aha! Your honest hadji set the burglars into your apartment. And he'll have to find the other guy. He'll find him. He doesn't have to look far. It's his man. Enough already! -We also have a problem with Cenk. -No way, he quit. I don't mean that. -He hit the man, he's hiding it. -So what? Is it worth it? Are you out of your mind? -Is he worth all this trouble? -This guy is my best friend. Look, this is nothing like the restoration business. And on top of it, you took the guy outside. He has a pulse but he's unconscious. He might be hemorrhaging. It's up to the hospital people. What am I talking about? You got us all into that shit. Don't even start. -I don't have to do this. -Really, don't. I don't have to do anything. Let's go to Ilkyardim Hospital. Memorial is too far. I said the Memorial. Go on. -Cenk, come with me. -Why? We'll take my car. -Let them go. Come with me. -I'm going with them. We'll go later. Come on. All right. -I am going. -There you go. All right. That's better. Merve. Merve. Please take care of this. Thanks a lot. Don't mess it up any further. I'll call you. Make a right turn, and you're on the main street. -Hey. What the hell happened here? -I'll tell you. -Hello, old man, what are you doing? -What happened to the guy? -Nothing. -Did he die? -Nothing to worry. -God help him. Thanks, thanks. -I worried about him. -Nothing to worry. Come on now. -I wish him all the best. -Thank you. Bye. Go. He just wouldn't leave. Faruk. Bro? Bro! Shut up. Don't "bro" me. Cihan. Who the hell did we hire? Who is working in my building in Karakoy? You pious bastard. You let the burglars in. Who are they? What? How could this happen? These guys attack my dear friend, my brother, in my apartment, in my place. How can this be? "How can this be?" right? How can this be? Who are they? You'll get their asses to me. You'll get their asses to me. Shut up! Don't get me started with you. Shut up! Listen to me, don't tell anybody anything. I will tell you later. All right. All right. What the hell is that? Is it still off-limits for you? Well, not all the time. Let me get rid of this before anyone sees it. -Have they stolen anything? -They even got these. Faggots. They even stole the rug. Look at this. Do you think they know the good stuff from the bad? Holy shit. Listen. Do you think my nose is broken? Are you crazy? You wouldn't be able to stand the pain. -All right, let's go. -Why don't you tell me what happened? What? -What happened? -He headbutted me. And there was someone else? Where? Merve said there was someone else. Oh, right. The boy. He ran away. Bastard. We need to silence him first. Look at me. Did he see anything? Come on, no. He ran away. He didn't see anything? How should I know? He didn't see anything. -I don't know. Come on, let's go. -All right, all right. You go down, I really need to pee. Erdem, we got to rush him to Ilkyardim, this guy is dying. Hurry up! Come on! Never mind! Why are you even listening to the ambulance driver? Do we know anyone there? Okay. Let me know then. -Holy shit! -What's wrong? The ambulance men insisted on going to the Ilkyardim. They turned back. -Is there something wrong? What happened? -No. Just the meddling of the jerks in the ambulance. Nothing's wrong. -Merve said murder. -Just ignore her. She went on and on, witnesses and stuff. Merve always looks at things from the negative side but she's reliable. -I'm not saying that. I don't care Merve. -What then? -What if something happens to the guy? -We won't let that happen. We'll find the guys, and we'll take care of it. That's it. -Move. -Wait a minute. Don't go. -We can't go. -Why not? We can't go to the hospital. Come here, sit down. The first floor is okay. All right? Then the seaport business is about to start. You delivered your Project, it was perfect. Come here, sit down. If the building gets mixed up with this shit, we're fucked. Well then, why am I staying here? I just wanted to surprise you. I couldn't get it done in time. What can I say? The man turned out to be the painter. If they talk, you know... -What then? -If they talk... ...we can forget about this building. Then it will all go to the old man. And it will cost me. The old man gave this place to me. But he told me to wait. Then I barged in, because you were coming. Brooklyn style and all. Anyway. The man bought half the buildings in Karakoy. Are you still mad at me? Nope. I mean, you're getting married. She's famous. It's hard for her father. So you're getting married to avoid tittle-tattle? Don't be ridiculous. I always liked her. Always? Never had a chance to tell you. -How long has it been? -Six years. -What? -Six. It's been a long time. Right. Time flies by. Anyway. Let me take care of the first floor. -Call the ambulance. -I will. I will call them all. -How will you go? -My car is at the parking lot. Okay. See you. -Call me, alright? -I will. Okay. Come on now. -I'm very sorry. -Don't be ridiculous. Jesus, Asli, just answer your phone for a change! Ece. Ece! Why didn't my brother come out? Don't come any closer or I'll call the cops. Ece, tell me why my brother didn't get out. What brother? Listen, we're not burglars. Tell the man to let go of my brother. -Go away! -I don't want anything to happen to him. Hey, Ece. You should have thought about that before breaking in. Let's go and get my brother before something happens to him. What more could happen to your brother? Go away or I'll call the cops. What cops? Shut up. Don't get the cops involved. Shut up. Don't shout, don't shout! What did you do to my brother? What did you do? Shut up. -Help! -Shut up! Help! If anything ever happens to my brother... If anything had happens to my brother, I'll kill you. Help! Get up! Shut up! -Help! -Hush! Hush, hush! For God's sake, be quiet! Come here. I won't do anything. I won't do anything, I won't. Come here. Shut up. Get it? Look at me! I'll slice you up. Get it? If you ever scream again, I'll slice you up. -Shut up. Don't shout. -All right. -Help! -Shut up! Shut up. -What are you doing? -Don't shout, you bitch. I'll kill you, shut up. Cut it out. Cut it out. Cut it out. That's it. Shut up. Hello, hello, Efe. What's up? Ümit, slow down. What are you talking about? Where are you? -What happened? -Where is Tayfun? All right, I'll be there. What... Okay, we're on our way. Ümit, come on. All right. What's going on? Efe. What is this? What's going on? Are they cops? Is this the police or the ambulance? What is it? What did you do? Did you hand my brother over to the cops? What did you do to him? Now listen. If anything happens to my brother, I'll kill you. Get it? I'll slice you up. What did you do? Alright. I mean... -Be careful with his arm. -Shut the door. I mean, if my father-in-law sees a problem, we won't be able to earn our dosh from this place. So we'll take care of this somehow without getting him involved. Hello. We're still here, we won't be coming. What's with the police? I am calm. I'm just asking why the hell there is a cop. Oh. So the cop is always there. Then say so. The police? The usual procedure, that's all. I guess the cop will take a look at it. What? It's got nothing to do with us. We're saving a poor guy on the street. -I hope the cop thinks the same. -Of course, he will. Don't be such a pessimist. You didn't come all the way from there for nothing. Wait a minute. Hold on. -Where the hell are you? -We're here. All is well? -What had happened to Tayfun? -Who the fuck is she? -This broad... -Man, isn't she... -This is Ece Aydoðan, man! -What the hell? -We were in the apartment... -Man, what did you do man? -Her stud jumped on my brother. -Where are they? -Over there, come on, let's go. -Did you break into the apartment? We were in the apartment. They were fucking around. -Yes. What are we going do with her? -He says they attacked Tayfun. -All right, I didn't hear you. -She and her stud. Where's Tayfun? I said over there. What're you doing? Move. -Stop. Calm down. -Guys, Cihan is coming. -Okay. Calm down. -Cihan is coming. Be cool. Be calm. Don't make a fuss. Alright, don't say anything. Okay, don't say anything. I'll put the fear of God in you, idiots! Did I ask any money from you? -All right, Cihan... -Did I ask any money from you? Cihan. Put your hand down! My brother left something there and we came back to take it. -That's not what I heard. -All right. Quiet. Look... don't you dare to fuck me, we earn our bread from that apartment! I'm not fucking you man. They knocked my brother out. -Did you do anything? -No, we didn't. What could we do? -You'll all get into trouble. -Tayfun didn't come out of the apartment. -Look, they were messing around... -Then they jumped on Tayfun. -Let's go, come on... -Who? This one and her stud. Stop, stop. Hey! Hey! -How did you find the apartment? -Tayfun works here. He said there was a rug. He said we'll get the rug. So we took the rug and... -What are you doing? You idiot. -Man, are you insane? -Cihan is calling. -Don't answer. Not now. What was your father saying? Higher education... ...preferential treatment, touching the base. Well, you'll provide the higher education, I'll provide the preferential treatment... and touching the base is already... Where did you find these? These are all there is. I can't believe this. My mom looked everywhere for these. I was planning to give them to you some other time but I guess it was meant to be today. Faruk... What is this? -Let me check it out. Stay here. -Hey, wait a minute. Come on, come on! Guys, easy. Where's Tayfun? Who attacked Tayfun? Where's my brother. -Miço. Miço, this one? -He's not the one, this one. -Where's my brother? -Say something. I'll just stab this. Speak. What are you doing here? -It was an accident. It is fine. -Another accident is about to happen. -Be calm, Miço. -Your brother is a painter, right? Yes, he is. So what? So what? Easy, Ece, easy. All right. Come on now, come on. Don't be afraid, it's okay. All right. Don't be afraid, all right. Don't move, let's not hurt you. Listen, I am very sorry. All right. All right. Are you all right, lady? Untie my hands. My hands, untie my hands, please. -All right. All right. -Untie them. I guess... -...there was a misunderstanding. -Untie. Untie. -My hands... -All right. Easy. -Untie them! -Okay, okay... Open that door. Open it! Don't touch me! -Open that door! -All right. Let me out of here! Miss Ece. Miss Ece. Lady, I'm Cihan. Hello. Calm down. Don't you recognize me? It's me, Cihan. We met before. -Where? -At Faruk's place, at his office. I didn't have my beard at then. It was a long time ago. Easy now. -Don't you know Cihan? -We don't know anyone called Cihan. The guy with the beard. -No. -Okay, all right. Ümit, Efe! Who hired your brother then? -Enough, man, blah-blah-blah... -What is this? Man I got dizzy. If anything happens to my brother, I'll kill you. I swear I'll slice you up. -I'll kill your girl. -Enough! -Your brother is in the hospital. -Which hospital? -Is it the Memorial, what's the name? -Ilkyardim. Taksim Ilkyardim. In the hospital. Listen to me. -Are you lying? -Our friend is with him. Who is your friend? Your brother is all right. There was an accident. There was an accident. Let's go to the hospital. -To the hospital? -Yes. You can see him. Then you'll be relieved. -What do you think, Faruk? -How? -All together? -Yes, all together. I have a car. Okay, then. Really? Sorry to hear what happened. Do you know the individual? No, we found him on the street. Do you know his name, so that we can call a relative? -No. Apparently, he had hit his head and he was lying on the ground. -I'm told he didn't have any ID. -No. -I thought I could inform a relative. -My friends stayed there. They will ask around for anyone who knows him. Your friends. There were two of them? -Yes. -But you came here alone? One has a trip tomorrow, the other one just arrived yesterday. When I called the ambulance, they were close by and came to help. I got it. But they didn't come here. No, they didn't come here. Anyway, this has got nothing to do with them. Besides, one of them is Faruk Bilir. It would be pointless at this time. -Faruk Bilir? -Faruk Bilir, the businessman. You may know him. Faruk Bilir. Doesn't ring a bell. He wanted to avoid publicity. -You know they write whatever they please. -I understand. Nevzat, how is your uncle? He's doing well, Doctor. Didn't get the chance to thank you. He is doing very well. Thank you so much for asking. -Take care of business. We'll talk later. -All right. Ma'am, excuse me, I was about to say.... -So you don't know the individual -We don't, Officer. Well, but... ...no one comes to the hospital in the middle of the night for a man that they don't know. Well, we were not raised that way. And besides I am a lawyer. Why didn't you call the police? There're no bandages at the police station. Right. Fine. But you said something like him being familiar from around. Officer, we work in Karakoy. We spend the whole day there. We saw the guy on the street, he had a familiar face. We brought him to the hospital. -I hope he gets well, that's all. -I understand. My chief officer doesn't answer his phone. Good, good. Huh? I got it, I got it. -I got it. -Have a good watch. Thank you. Good night. Chief, good evening Nevzat here. Come on Merve, answer the phone. Put on the speakerphone so we can hear it. I'll put on the speaker if she answers the phone. See, she doesn't answer. Are you lying? They are at the hospital. How can she answer the phone at the hospital? -Well, she doesn't hear the phone. -Just a second... Are we going like this? What should we do? Let's go... ...but... ...how? I told you we can take my car. Bozo. -All right. -Come on boys, come on. Listen to me. Look, if anything happens to my brother, I'll kill you, I'll kill you, too. All right man, all right. -Did Cihan call you? -No. Faruk! We don't want to crowd the hospital, right? -What are you doing in there? -Start walking. -Come on, come on... -Let me go. Tell the guys in there not to do anything stupid. -Now walk. Let's go to the hospital. -Sucker! -Be smart, okay? -All right, all right. Look, just like decent human beings, we didn't want to crowd the hospital. -Easy, your friend is safe with us. -All right, calm down. Stand up. Don't be afraid. All right. We'll have to wait, bro. I'm calling them, but they don't answer. -Open that door, open it. -All right. All right. -I cannot breathe. -They are not answering. Help, help! Help me, anybody? Help! Okay. -Okay. -Take me out. Open the door. Listen I am calling, but they don't answer. Look, I am calling. -Did you drop something? -My phone... -Give me your phone. Call the police. -All right, all right. -Call the police, here they are. -Not the police... Go on, call them, give it to me. -Be quiet, for heaven's sake. -Police! Police! Isn't there anyone to help? No police. Look, keep the cops out of this. -Police! -Don't shout. Help me! Don't shout. -Shut up! -Don't hit me. All right. All right, I am sorry. I won't hurt you. I am not touching you. All right. We surely did wrong, but let's keep the police out of this. All right, I'm sorry. I'll kill myself. Look, lady, Faruk saved me. I don't want it to be this way, either. Faruk pulled me out of the mess I was in. I'll do anything for you. Just don't mention the police. What should I do now? How can I even look Faruk in the eye? It's not my fault, is it? I'll do anything but don't mention the police. Besides he called and shouted and took it out on me. Who called you? Who? -Look, these guys are young. -Who took it out on you? Faruk did. What should we do? Faruk must not go to the police. I couldn't answer the phone. Well I couldn't. Who is his brother? The other guy? Really? Did he say anything? Where did you find him? Did you call Cihan? Good, all right. All right, okay. No. No problem with the police, but the guy is in intensive care right now. How should I know? I'll tell you all about it when you arrive. Is he all right? -How is my brother? -She hung up. He's Okay. But you did wrong tonight. -He had left his things. -Don't bullshit me. Tayfun did wrong. Then the accident happened. Now, our problem is to prevent anything worse from happening. Right? We wouldn't want that. We wouldn't want that. Do you? We're trying to help, that's all. Look. -It's okay. -Man. We've got nothing to do with the police. -Look, don't turn us in. -Don't worry, we're good. How old is this building? -How should I know? -Did Tayfun fall down here? Where else? There's blood everywhere. -Do you want? -All right. Let's hope nothing happens to Tayfun. They put him into the ambulance and took him to the hospital. He's all right. -Please. -All right then. Will this place be a coffee shop? No. The whole building will be a betting shop. What a jerk. You're so gullible. I asked a question. I just asked a question. Am I not allowed to ask a question? I worked here for three years, right? -I did, did you? -Get out of here. -What are you looking at? -Nothing. Yeah, right, you worked so much. You came in here in the morning and crapped out in a corner. What did Faruk tell you? Well, he got mad, he shouted. But what did he say? What did he say happened? What? Well, I mean... ...I am really sorry but when... ...you were doing it the guys barged in, I guess. -Did Faruk tell you that? -Oh, no. The guys told me. Actually, they wouldn't do anything wrong. What exactly did Faruk tell you when he called you? He said: "They tried to rob my brother. You hired thieves." Well, I am the contractor. He told me that there was a boy and we needed to find him. He means Kýlýç. He told me that they wronged his friend. -Could you give my phone back? -Huh? We won't have any of that in our club. Right. Don't you have my phone? Can I get it? Please. Efe, tell him. 0532 280... ...90. ..100. Look man, give it back. -Man, listen to him. -Why on earth would we have your phone? Buzz off. Enough is enough. Oh. -He challenges you. -Did he? Go on. Why don't you take it? Lady. Did the boys do anything wrong? What else would they do, huh? What else? There must have been a misunderstanding. What misunderstanding? What are you talking about? They're good boys. They wouldn't have done anything wrong. Listen! Tonight, don't let anything happen to anyone. I won't, don't worry. Nothing will happen. We can go if you want to. Let's go to the apartment. Let's go there. But don't cry out for the police. Let's go to the apartment together. Let's go, although I wonder how I will look Faruk in the face. My life is over. It's over. -Is there anything we should be aware of? -No, these are kids from our neighborhood. -We can help you out. -There is no problem. One of the boys' brother got sick. I mean, we are taking him to the hospital. -Officer, about the license. -We also need to seize the car. -I understand, but is it necessary? -When there is a suspicious case. Why is it taking so long? I know these guys. I was taking them to the hospital. And I know you, Mr. Bilir. But you have had some alcohol. -Go on, write my ticket. Go on. -Will do. Go on, take my driver's license as well, take it. Why don't you answer? Hello. Son, why don't you answer your phone? What? Where are you? -What hospital? -What's going on? What's wrong with Tayfun? Huh? Tayfun is in the hospital and you didn't do anything, is that so? I'm going to beat the shit out of you, Sabri, I will. All right idiot, all right. Which hospital? Sabri, is Tayfun all right? Okay, don't go there all together. Stay behind for a while. All right, I'll be there. They are going to the hospital. Who's at the apartment? Everyone is going to the hospital... Ece? Why is Tayfun at the hospital? Tell me, what happened in the building? -Take it, take it. -Give me. Why don't you take it? Take it like a man. Hurray! Why don't you take it? Take it like a man. Hurray! All right, all right, it was a joke. Take it. Take it. Just a joke. I don't have it. Why did you snatch the phone? -Did I snatch it? -Go on, give it to him. -Really? -Could you give it back? When did I get it? Do you have any coins? Coins, man. Do you give up? -That's enough. -Give up. What the hell are you doing to him? What were you doing upstairs for half an hour? -Did you jerk off? -No, man. I took a shit. -Do I need permission for that? -Leave the man alone. -Take it. -It was a joke. Man? What the hell? Who is upstairs? Tell me, who's upstairs? How should I know? I don't know. -Come on. -It'll be fun. Man, just look at this. Look at it. Come. Come here. Come here. Lady, take my life if you must, but do not harm him. When we're done, I'll make you pay for this. That's a different thing. Tell me now, what were you doing back there? What are you doing here? What are you doing here? Huh? What happened in the apartment? What did you do to Tayfun? -Are you questioning me? -I'm just asking a question. It's none of your business. What is it to you? What should you care? Look, I'm the one looking after these boys. -Why don't you call Faruk? -Lady... Tell him that you locked me up in this car and wouldn't let go. -Then let's see what happens to you. Huh? -You're making a big mistake. Call and tell him. Say: "Your lady is in the car". Say: "We are criminals." -Shame on you. -Aren't you all criminals? Do you want money? Is that it? Huh? Do you want money? How much are you worth? -Don't tempt me. -Are you threatening me? -I am asking you a question, bitch. -You won't know what hit you. Go on, open the door. I've had enough of this bullshit. Sit down. Sit down, bitch! Sit down! Be smart. Don't do anything foolish. You shouldn't have blown, man... They're lucky. If you weren't here, I would have shown them. Now your driving license is gone for six months. What will you do? Your father's name is Yilmaz, isn't it? I can be your driver, what do you say? Cut it out, Sabri! That's right, Yýlmaz. You have three sisters. You break into apartments. That's nonsense. -One of our friends is sick-- -Don't want to hear about your friends. Not at all. Who will take care of your sisters? And your father is not around. You don't know Cihan... but he knows your father well. Now you will be smart. You'll be calm at the hospital. Do we have a deal? Shit, why is this light taking so long? Finally! Go on, go on. Captain. A little faster, Captain. Ece, be smart. Faruk said "my brother." What are you talking about? What I'm saying is Faruk said that they did his friend wrong. He didn't say "my fiancée." -So? -So... -So... -Why did he say "my friend" but not my fiancée", right? -So? -If my girlfriend was in that apartment... ...if anyone had done anything wrong to my dearest... Right? So no one did you wrong. Don't go there. Or no one knows about it. Let it be that way. Let's make a deal. No one knows that you were there tonight. Now you will... ...absolutely make sure that... Faruk forgives them. Is that understood? This subject will be closed. Faruk will forgive them or I won't. Do we have an understanding? Huh? I believe we do. Come here. She's running away. Come here. -All right, all right. Enough. -Oh, my! We're just having fun. What's wrong with that? Well, just don't do it. Come on. There won't be any cops right. It's all right, we got it. Don't you worry about it. -What's going on? -You couldn't go to the Memorial. -Faruk, don't talk like an idiot. -What's up? Are you the one who fled the apartment? Look at me! Look at me. Are you high? I asked you something. Look at me. -What's your name? -Kýlýç. -What's yours? -This is not a game. Your brother is fine. He will be discharged from the hospital, and this story will be over, got it? We won't press any charges. Do you understand? Your brother tried to kill a man. I'll make your life miserable. Do you understand? -Brother. -Go. -Did you get that, too, chatter box? -Yes. You should be thankful to Faruk. Otherwise, you would have regretted your actions. Now there is a cop in there. You will tell him that you don't know anything. You were not there. Faruk and I saw your brother on the street when we were walking by. All right? Where did we see your brother? You didn't break into the apartment. There was no burglary. All right? -We're not burglars. -Where did we see your brother? -On the street. -We saw him on the street. We found his phone, we informed you. Do you hear me? No apartment, no paint job, no burglary. -All right? -All right. -When will I see my brother? -You'll see him if you listen to me. Let's go man. We're protecting you. Get the hell out of here. Get the hell out of here. Yes? Yes, sweetheart. Huh? I took my pills, I did. It's not late. Oh, God. You treat me like a child. Come on, hang up, hang up. My wife, she says she cooked some semolina halva. It's still warm. So, Ece, do we have a deal? You know what I mean. You won't involve the boys. And for your sake, I hope that Tayfun gets well. Otherwise, I'll break the deal. And I'll break my rules. Are you done? We'll see. Taxi! Will she fly now? It's up to her. Go on. Ece! -Cenk! -The cunt ran away! Why did you let the man go? Go, go, go! -Are you all right? What happened? -I'm okay. The boy caught me. Lady! -Let's get out of here. -Stay away! Go! It's Cihan, man. Ece, wait a minute. Did they do anything to you? -No, they didn't. -Tell me the truth. -Bro. -Why don't you just leave now? Easy there. -He's not the one anyway. -Ümit! Back off. You will stop now. You will. Let's get out of here. Let's go. What did you do to her? What did you do to her? Easy. Easy. -Cenk, please. Look at me. -One minute. You stay here. Cenk! Cenk, I want to go. Stop! Cenk! Police! Anybody there? Help! Easy. Take a hike. Come on, come on. Go ahead. -All right, man. -Go ahead. Go ahead, sucker. Police! Police! Someone call the police! Break it up, break it up. You're fucked. I swear you're fucked. What's going on? He's dying, isn't he? I don't trust that idiot. -Where is my brother? -Kýlýç... what did we talk about earlier? Why don't you listen to me? Why do you have to make a mess? Can't we take him to the Memorial? What are you talking about? He can't leave now, it's impossible. Sister. I've got to see my brother. Kýlýç! We'll see him in a second. The doctor is on his way. Easy now. Come on, now. Come on. If the boy testifies, do you think it'll be over? I will talk to the police. You keep quiet. -Good evening. -Good evening. The younger brother is here, Officer. You can talk to him if you want to. We should talk first, shouldn't we, Officer? -Yes, let's talk. -That's right. -Mr.Bilir? -Yes, well, we found him-- -Now it makes sense. -I'm sorry? You see, the boy is shaken. The lady said you were Faruk Bilir. But at first I couldn't recall who you were. But now that I've seen you... How are you? I'm all right, thank you. How are you? Let's not be very hard on the boy, Officer. -Let's talk to him. -Huh? Very sorry to hear what happened. Very sorry. -Thank you. -Thank you. How are you holding up? Are you okay? Yes, we're hanging there. It's very late... Cenk. -Are you sure you're okay? -Yes, it's over. I'm fine. I was in the car. It's okay. -Cenk, is the man all right? -What happened to you? Tell me. Well, when I left the apartment, the boy was waiting outside. It's over now. It's over. They didn't do anything to you, did they? -No. -And nothing happened? -Cenk. -Are you sure about that? Nothing happened, I was very scared. That's it. Nothing happened. Please. Let's go home. Can we go inside? Let's go inside. My brother... Hmm, yes? He hit his head. Who called you? They did. Do your parents know? We just informed a relative. He'll let them know, won't he, Faruk? There's this man called Cihan from their neighborhood. We called him. Your brother, was he alone? I don't know. Can he see his brother first? We'll come back. Let me get an ID then. -Oh, Nurse, can we come now? -Come, Kýlýç, let's see your brother. -We'll be right back. -Well, let me get that ID first. Officer, let us do this first. We'll take care of everything. Don't worry about a thing. The boys are from our neighborhood. And I've just spoken to the Chief Officer Yusuf. -Chief Officer Yusuf? -You know him, Yusuf Özbek? Just a minute. Don't worry. Who are you? -Where is Faruk? -What is it to you? Who are you? Do you realize what you have done? -Cenk, Cenk stop. Wait. -Lady, where is Faruk? Where is Faruk? At the hospital. Is Tayfun all right? I don't know. I mean, he's in the hospital. Are you Faruk's best friend? -Yes, why? -Good. Lady, do we have a deal? What is he talking about? -I guess we have a deal. -Ece? -Let's go inside. -What is he saying? I need to go to the apartment Cenk. Brother. What did they do to you? God. Please don't take my brother away. Don't let him die. Don't let me stay behind. Don't leave me alone. Come no now. Come on. The man is dying. I know. The man breaks into the apartment. There is extortion, there is burglary, there is everything. You took the man out, and you put us in. You couldn't go to the Memorial Hospital. Faruk, don't get me started now. He is obsessed. Hello. Murat. We couldn't make it there. They took him to Ilkyardim. Yes. I guess there is no blood-flow to the brain, something like that. You forgot these. Your keys and all. Are you all right? Would you like to drink something? -I'll take some water. -All right. Why didn't you go to the hospital? Someone had to stay with the boys. I will go. All right. Where are you going? To the hospital. No, you won't. Why not? Will you give money to the boys in the building, too? I hope they don't talk. -Let's first pull through this one. -If we can. You were such a calamity howler the whole night! -We would have said self-defense. -Merve, please. -Please what, Faruk? Please what? -Don't do it. Don't do it, not anymore. So, you acted upon Merve's words, is that it? Supposedly we are saving a man we found on the street. So there are people at the hospital and they are taking care of him. Yes, they're taking care of him. But now if you go there, no one can take care of anything. I just can't sit here doing nothing. All right, go home. What are you talking about? I am constantly thinking about the hospital. What will you tell Faruk there? What did you tell Faruk? -We didn't talk about it. -You didn't talk. We didn't have time. You didn't, you didn't have time. Okay, okay, look. You never came here. -Really? -Yes. Nothing happened. Nothing happened. That's the best. And the three of us will have breakfast in the morning, is that it? What's that supposed to mean? What if they hadn't broken in? What would have happened then? -Would we be acting as if nothing had happened? -I don't know, Ece. What do you think? You think that I just felt like dropping by, and I would fuck you and then life would go on? Is that it? Is that it? You're getting married. You're getting married with Faruk. It will destroy me if this shit hits the fan. It will destroy my career. Wait your turn. What? -Did you say to wait my turn? -All right, Merve. -Are you kidding me? -Calm down. What do you mean "wait your turn"? We all got involved with Cenk's shit. Now I have to wait my turn? A few hours ago, you were begging me to come up with something. For two hours, I have been trying to clean up your mess. -And this is what I get? -I'm telling you what to do. Don't think further. The kid will testify. All right? That's it. Kýlýç, come on, cheer up. It's all going to be fine. Listen, the doctor was positive as well. Let's go and talk to that police officer. -No, they'll fuck me up. -Man, we don't have any ID. Don't worry about that, come on. -I have to call my mom. -Let's get this thing done with, and then we'll call your mother. Look... what's done is done. We cannot change the past. You should go home. I will not get married. What? I won't marry him. Is this the right time for that? Right time for what? I won't get married, Cenk. And I will tell him. -I can tell him tonight at the hospital. -Marvelous! But it has to be tonight, right? I mean, not before, not after. Tonight. Ece let me ask you something. Why did you come here tonight? I wanted to see you. That's it? Yes, that's it. I immediately wanted to see you again. Just like that. Then with everything that had happened tonight, that car, the smells, that boy. It's over now, I was so scared that now there is nothing left. -If there is no going back, so much the better. He loves you. I know. But when he was away, I never wanted to see him so soon. I mean, I didn't want to see him immediately. But tonight you left, and I left right after you did. Sister. I swear to God we're not burglars. One of our friends' brain is sick. Come on, don't play the victim, it's past midnight. Hello, Osman. -We'll call you Osman now and then. -Okay, okay. -Goodbye. -Goodbye, Osman. Click kidi click kida. Come on, boys, let's go. Merve. Come on. I'm going to ask you something. Where were you all this time? When I left... ...I stopped thinking. I was ready to come with you. But I wasn't. Why did you go, Cenk? Why did you really go? To become a man. You were a man. Right. I was just standing there in the corner. Yes, you were standing in the corner, all by yourself, very beautifully. -Aren't you anymore? -This time, I am standing in the middle. Do you enjoy it? I did, until I saw you. I mean, I thought I could handle it. Our thing was a long time ago. But now it's just like yesterday. For a moment, while I was looking at you... Then I thought we couldn't be together, all three of us. I mean, it can't happen. I went out and came here. I'd gather my things and leave. Then you came. So you were running away. Again. What is going on? Is everything all right? We talked to the officers. Do you always handle things just by talking? No worries, we took care of it. You took care of it, Faruk. We didn't do anything. Cut it out, please. This thing is about to be over. Come on. It's about to be over, is it? -Merve, please. -You know better, that's why I'm asking. Is it over? Is it over now that you did your talking? Everything is fine now. It is cool. You took care of the ones at the apartment. You took care of everything whether the man dies or not. -You're being ridiculous. -You are safe. The cop is your friend. The boy testified. You're telling me what to do. I don't have to worry now. So everything is okay, isn't it? Don't shout. You took care of everything. Can't I shout all I want? -Come on, let's go. Come on. -I am curious, what did you tell them? -Let me drop you, we can talk on the way. -No, I'll drop you, Faruk. Don't call me again. Don't call me when you're drunk, or when you're sober. Do not call me anymore. You keep asking me why our relationship didn't work out. I'll tell you. You can only have a relationship with yourself. I pity that girl. Come on, now, tidy up everything. See whether it's over or not. Merve. Bro. Bro. -You won't turn us in, will you? -Just a minute. Merve. Merve. Listen to me. Just listen for a moment. Merve. Merve. Brother. So what should we do now? Should we stay or go? What was I supposed to do? Huh? What should I have done? How was I supposed to know what was going on? I just arrived today. When I suddenly saw you there, I was confused. You are with Faruk. Wedding at Ciragan and everything. On the other hand, there is the business. There were parties and so on. On top of it, some men break in. The guy knocks his head. Someone comes and says it's murder. The other one takes him out saying that there are problems about the building. He calls Salih, his father. -And I keep quiet. -Don't yell at me. -I am not. -Why are you yelling? I am not. I am keeping quiet, in order to keep you out of it. Is that so? And still you blame me. Did I do all this? Huh? I don't know. Some other things come to my mind. I only said we should pretend you weren't here tonight, and I shut up. That's it. But now it came back to bite me in the ass. -It's not that simple, Cenk. -It isn't? -Really, it isn't. -How come? Let's talk about what happened earlier. Why did you come back? And we're back to square one. Why did you come back? You came back for Faruk. -For your work, didn't you? -Yes. Now you're trying to protect each other. Why did Faruk take the man out? I am such an idiot. You kept telling me the whole night. This building had problems and so on. If I get involved now, Faruk will be in trouble with my dad, and your business will be screwed, right? -Ece, don't be silly. -That's just it. How will Cenk fit into the big picture? And by coming here, I screwed everything. I am such an idiot. And you're telling me that you saw me and something happened to you. Nothing happened to you. -You both are motherfuckers. -Ece... And that's not even the real issue. There's a man dying there. What are you after? Were you thinking about this all along? Is this what you are? All this time? I mean, there won't be any complaints or anything, right? No, relax. Listen, call the guys and tell them to leave the building. We don't do that sort of shit, like stealing and stuff. It's just that our friend-- I get it. But listen. If you have fucked up that apartment, then I will-- Hey, Ümit. -Anyway. -Stop, stop, fine, he's fine. Tayfun is all right. Did you leave? -They have left. -Good. Is Cihan mad? -Ssh, hey. -No. Hey! Are... are you out? What the hell is going on? Huh? -Let me-- -Whose phone is that? I swear... Stop! Stop! Stop him! Get him! Get him! Ece, those are-- -I've had enough -Ece, Ece... Let me go. I said let me go. Ece. Ece, look at me. Look at me. I don't care about anything anymore. Listen to me. Thief! Someone stop him! Get him! Get him! -Come here. -I've got the thief. -He's a thief all right. My phone... -You want us to take him in? -I got him. -And you tell me you're not a thief. Where did you find that phone? Huh? Not a thief, my ass! Where did you find that phone? Go on, tell me! Stand up, stand up and talk. Leave him. I got him. Why don't you answer? Whose phone is this? -Look, my phone... -Whose phone is this? -Whose phone is it? -Look... Fuck you, you faggot. Come here. -Cut it out, come here. -Hey... Come here. All right, I got him. Let me go. See what's going on. I'll just check it out. All right? Then you can talk to Faruk if you want to. Talk to him. Talk to him. Let's talk together. We'll tell him that the three of us can't be together... ...that I want you. We'll tell him that you don't love him anymore. And being such morons, we have just realized that. We'll tell him that we don't know what will happen next, that nobody could know what's next. Let's also tell him that he could have his business and his project all for himself. We'll tell him whatever you want. All right? But murder is not a game, Ece. That is a dirty business. You shouldn't be involved in this. All right? I don't care anything else. Yes, to the right. Take a turn. Can you turn that music off? -Listen, you didn't hit anyone, all right? -I did. I did it. You weren't here. I was here. I did it. We did it. -Ece, don't get involved in this. -It's too late now. Please. -Cut it out. -Ece, you're such an idiot. Dumbass. I'll ask you something, dumbass. Are you still scared? -Scared of what? -Are you still scared of what you want? I'm not. Let's go... ...to the hospital first... ...and then we'll stand in the corner together. Come here. -Bro. -Come here. Tell me. Come on in. Come in. Where did you see them? -Man, I shouldn't. -Tell me, where were they? Hold on. -Was she his girlfriend? -Look... -Why don't you tell me? -Faruk, let the boy-- Shut up! Tell me, is she the one? Huh? Is she? Ece Aydoðan, she's very famous. Don't you know her? -Leave the kid alone. -Don't you know, Ece? Come here. Sit down. Tell me. Tell me how they were making love. Tell me, go on. You said you saw them. Are you trying to create a rift between me and my friend? -Faruk. -You told me that you saw them. You are destroying our friendship. -Leave the boy alone. -Just tell us the way it is. Tell me how they were making love. Where? Was it on the table? Was it on the couch? Were they making noises? How? Come on, tell me! Tell me. Come on tell me how they were making love. Let me hear it. How was their lovemaking? Come on, now, come on. Tell me. Tell me. What will you tell me? I wanted to see Cenk. -Did you arrange it beforehand? -Faruk. -Did you plan this? -Why don't you listen? Leave him. Why should I listen? -We didn't sleep, Faruk. -Oh, okay. It's fine then. -I came here. -Good job. I don't want to get married. Is that so? I don't want to get married. Did you figure that out tonight? Tonight I overcame my fear. Hey, man. Why don't you hold her hand? Hold it, man. Look, she's scared. So she came here... ...and what did you do? -I was about to leave, Faruk. -Really? I was going to tell you that I couldn't be with you any longer. Do you have any other place to go? Faruk. Actually, I shouldn't have come at all. Isn't that so? The whole night, you kept telling me lies, man. I was going to tell you. -I will ask you something. -Faruk, listen to me. -Was it worth it? -Man-- Was it worth the pain you gave me, asshole? Look, nothing happened here tonight. Yes, it was about to... but it didn't. But you knew it. You knew I couldn't forget her! You fucking know that I couldn't forget Ece. Don't you talk about pain. You were not even here, what the hell are you talking about? What the hell are you two talking about? I came here, it was me! -Why don't you ask me why I came here? -Why? To fuck him. -Is that it? -Didn't you come here to fuck him? -Is it that simple? -Yes. Let me tell you why I came here. I came here to see what you didn't have. I came here to see what was missing with you. Fuck you! Do you understand now? Not even one tenth of what you have been doing with others happened here tonight! What are you talking about? What the hell! Are you going to slap me? Slap me if you dare. Slap me if you dare. Look at me now. You think I don't know you're messing around? Stop bullshitting! Don't blame me. I struggled for all of us! I did everything for all of us. Bullshit! What struggle? Was it for all of us? -Who did you really struggle for? -What the hell are you talking about? I am going to the hospital to check on the man. Then we'll talk about it. Right, go now and do us all in. And you can explain this to your father. Don't draw my father into this. -You will not bring my father into this. -What did he have that I didn't? Tell me. -And why are you still here, sucker? -What are you talking about? What do you mean by all of us? What are you saying? I asked for an ambulance, and you didn't call it. You told me the building had problems. You took the man outside. You got that girl involved as well. Why did I do all of that? Huh? For us. I did it all for us. -That's not it, Faruk. -Oh, really? What then? You did it because you're afraid of your father-in-law. What else? Tell me, what else? You didn't do a thing for us. You never wondered what I want. You never asked it. Did you ever ask anyone what they want? You didn't. -But just let me tell you all the same. -Hello, Merve. -I don't want anything from you anymore. -Go on, you can tell me. -I don't want anything from you. -Fuck off. Tell me. The man died. There you go. I should go to the police station. Ece. I will go, okay? I pushed the man. He fell, and then he rolled down the stairs until he hit the first floor. Faruk, I hit the man. Cenk didn't want me to get involved. I don't know if he was trying to protect me or you. I never wanted this to happen. I am so sorry. Cenk! Cenk! Cenk! Stop! Call an ambulance! Call an ambulance! Faruk, call an ambulance! -Ambulance! -Cenk! Cenk! Ambulance! Where's the phone? Hello, we need an ambulance. It's urgent! He's not breathing! He's not breathing!
