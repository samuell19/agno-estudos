IN THE NAME OF THE PEOPLE Starring Director of photography Screenplay Director In this story, any possible resemblance to actual persons is coincidental. Some good people. We're trying, Comrade Chief! Why not ask them inside? Don't waste your time, woman. Look who I live with! Drive! Without asking the Director? It's not right. Just do something, don't ask the Director. Get a hold of yourself. Mira! Stop! We could have run you over! - Are you crazy? - I am, Mira, help! The Chief took Radoje, my fiancé. It's an honor, the Chief took him personally. He must have shot his mouth off. He didn't say anything! We have to get married. - We've set the date. - You're getting married? It's a big thing. Alright, I'll take care of it. Let's go. Move. PUBLIC BATH Hey, get in line. C'mon, Milutin, we don't have time. Don't wait in line, just go in! How long do we have to wait? You'll wait until I feel like it. Good day, Jole! Good luck to you. You're hurrying to the celebration? Director Todor called us personally. I heard... - he promised new workers' housing. - He sure did. - High-rises? - 15 floors each. With Todor, our city will flourish. It sure will, thanks to him. And if I'm patient... a new bath. Leave it to me, don't worry, Jole. I'm next. You are, man... Wait. See those eyes, hubby? I'm glad, woman. My Director isn't awarded an order every day. You could at least not think of your Director when you're naked. The whole country will be ours For us to celebrate, celebrate work! Lift the foreheads high We, the heroes of our own work. The whole country will be ours For us to celebrate, celebrate work! And now we will ask... our Municipal President, Comrade Krsto... to present this high award to our Director, Comrade Todor. Honestly... I'm more happy than if I received it myself. Thank you. - Long live Comrade Todor! - Long live! Lift the foreheads high We, the heroes of our own work. The whole country will be ours For us to celebrate, celebrate work! Did it smudge? Just a little. - I'll be back. - Go on. - Speak. - That guy's arrest went over well. I expected that. And? - They talk about Director Todor. - Celebrate him? Everyone hopes... - our city will flourish with him. - Flourish? That's just what we need. What's the talk? They say that our celebrant already has his eyes on your armchair. Do they say that he's eyeing yours too? I raise this glass... in honor of you all... my friends. I will try to deserve this award on my first assignment, which is... a trip to Kinshasa. I think after that, a new chapter will open for our city. Thank you and cheers! Who should open the chapters of your city... President? Him or you? In the field he rides Oh, a strong hero In the field he rides Oh, a strong hero Across the flat field On a black horse Look how he rose up, the bastard. Ajka watched him from the house Across the flat field On a black horse Hey, Ajka watched him from the house Hey, strong hero and your feathers, your feathers to me... Honestly... if anyone should be awarded an order... it's the two of us. We should take him... back where he came from. He really got cocky. What will you bring me from Kinshasa? As a good clerk, you deserve crocodile leather shoes. I already have a room full of shoes. I'm not a centipede! A dress, then. Just give the measurements. Better to take me with you... ...and take my measurements there. This isn't a vacation. Attention! Yugoslav Aerotransport announces the departure on line JU 741 for Belgrade. We invite passengers on the plane. I repeat. Yugoslav Aerotransport announces the departure on line JU 741 for Belgrade. We invite passengers on the plane. Give it to me. - Well goodbye, my Milutin. - Goodbye. I'm sorry we couldn't drive. If not for the sea. Look after Marika and the kids. Don't worry, like you're with them. - Have a good trip. - Thanks. Goodbye. Take care. Don't forget the medication. Have a good trip. Comrade Maksim! Comrade Maksim! Something important for you! Judge Milić... baptized the child last night. I thought I'd ask him about that promise too... Listen priest, I'll kill you, I swear to God! Do you know what it means that he's there alone? I need a fortune teller to know what Todor is doing in Kinshasa! I can't monitor the situation! Who am I? Listen... Start spreading the word now that you're his mistress. What are you saying? What will people say? I'm a spinster! Nothing to be afraid of. I've taken in worse than you and they walk like the chosen. They lack nothing. Milutin... It's a little tough. But it's good. What is this talk about your Director? Let it go! People will always chatter about something. You keep moping, you should go out among people a bit. My husband on the road and me living it up! If he's on the road, he's not in a monastery, don't worry. You heard? People talk. About whatever. Here it is! Highland style! It smells... ...like the soul! Come on, tell me, who will eat the meat? Who will eat it up? Where are you going? What do you mean? You can't go this way. We always go this way. Now you can't. C'mon. Go away! - Around? - Go away! See how I look out for you. There are more police than people! I see. Honestly, I wish there were no people! Aye, as the situation develops, I think your wish will come true! Here they come. What did I tell you? She's never been prettier than she is now. Good timing, you two! We were just thinking that our hooks were empty. We are fish that only bite on fine bait. What? And we're not fine? Come over here for a bit. Let's go for a bit. I don't like those jokes. Another time! Relax. The chick will come to bed on her own. I happened to pass by... and dropped in to see if I can help with something... Thanks, Ana. I hear something is going on with my husband. Don't frighten me. There's talk about his secretary. Well... Don't pay attention to that. It's a passing fling. He's a proven cadre. But if you suspect something, I can... pay a little more attention to him. Yes, yes. Above all, that is... my duty to this house. In general, I think that... that we could... work more closely together. Mrs. Marika, it's Mira. Good evening. - Do you want something to drink? - Thanks, no, no. Thank you. What happened? Here, take a look. Go over there with Ana. His handwriting. Impossible! He wrote the same thing to me. Men... bastards... garbage. I had a Žarko, he drove the Utilities Director. Good riddance to him. But they should be repaid in the same way. Coming! - Speak. - What? Is it true what they say? Here you are! See for yourself, madam. He brought me this... from Munich. This... from Madrid. This... from Rome. But my favorite is... this gift here. Aye... I can hardly wait for the Director to return. Shall we go home? I don't feel like it. Let's take a little walk. I should go home. My woman is waiting. Do you love her very much? She's my woman. Have you had another? Why would I want another? Let's go home to the kids. Good day. Excuse me... My woman's away, so... Don't bother, poor guy. We stopped by... just to take a shit and go. What did you say? Chief's orders. - The Chief? - Yes. He can't be denied. Did he order you to piss too? No, by God. Well then, shit. And if you piss, I'll judge you myself. No kidding? Then we have to take you. It's an order! Miško! Milutin... you surely know... your Director's soul. I do know. We travel together... talk about everything... You talk about everything? What is this? 15 days together on the road and a half-page report? What the hell? So long ago, I don't remember. Who are you fooling? Do you know your duty? To drive the Director! Just to drive him, huh? You'll never be a man! Beat it! Get lost! And when you think it over, come back again! Go on! You heard. You see he doesn't know. If he knew anything, he'd tell you. He has to know... if he doesn't, you'll lose the keys to the new apartment, the Mercedes... my door and the rest, understand. He's my chance. - What is it? - Any news about my Radoje? I do what I promise. But you have to promise me something too. I'll do anything... just to release him. Don't worry, I'll take care of it. Just be smart. The Kostićs and the Mitrovićs celebrated their patron saint days. Vukašin baptized the child and the Mrvaljevićs are fasting. Watch the party members. Their Chief... It's not urgent now. But priest, did you confess that unfortunate man of mine? - No, by God. - Why? He's a very decent sinner. I'm afraid for him. It's a wonder I can deal with his decency. I don't know what to do. Have you tried buttercup? - No. - No? Brew some buttercup, have him drink it, and he has to talk. He's not so different, man. Milutin... My falcon, wake up. Come on, baby, have some tea. - What for, I'm healthy? - No you're not. You'll sleep better, my darling. C'mon, drink. At night how you... roll over, how you cry out, baby. - C'mon. - You haven't minded so far. I was younger, my darling. There. Drink, it'll be better for us now. All of it, my sunshine. Angels be with you and the holy cross... Milutin! Open your soul. What do you know about Director Todor? Do you know some fault of his? Open up, only that can save us. Tell me, God bless you, in what language does that unfortunate husband speak? - I don't know. - You're lying! - I did everything I could. - You didn't! I did. You love him, pity him! That lunatic is about to return from Kinshasa and we don't have any material yet! Calm down. I have something for you. What do you have? She's like the day she was born. Ones like that still exist? A baby. My sis. C'mon, Krstinjica. Wait, you look awful. Take that rag off, man. Quick, quick! C'mon. Take off the coat. Take it off, take it off! Just like we agreed. Just be smart. And listen to him. Hello, my child. Look at our Krstinjica, how she grew up... got prettier... became a young woman. Praise God, praise God. They took my Radoje. Don't worry about anything. We'll take care of it all. You love Radoje very much? I do. As you should. We'll take care of everything for him. I'll be your best man, if necessary. Now, take that broom down there. - Which one? - Down there. And come here, child. Now if you'd like... to clean for me from here to there... that way, if you please. Alright. Just relax! Song! A friendly song is sung A song celebrating work Let our hearts speak loudly... For the love of God, woman, give it to me! Why do you torture me all night! I won't, drop dead! Until you open your rotten soul. Rotten soul? Everyone knows that Todor is an decent man. As long as he's decent you won't touch me! But I'll give to others hand over fist. Out of spite. Do you know what you're saying, woman! I know. Mira! Are you crazy, where are you going? Mira! Did the Director call? No. Why do you ask? God bless you, why do I ask? I'm afraid for him. You? Don't yank my chain! What is it? Why the long face? Anyway. I know. I know, I know. You're used to those worldly parties... and these are boring. Come with me. - Where? - To "Three Hats". NO GROPING THE ARTISTS - MANAGEMENT When I go by the shed I know you by trade When I go by the corral I know you by speech When I go by the street I know her by her ass When I go by the shed I know you by trade When I go by the shed... - Who are these unfortunates? - Don't ask. If you want, you can go to a singles hotel with them later. You pay for all three of them and ride, my brother. How all three, God bless you? We don't have three of those. I don't know, Milutin, I haven't tried yet. When I go by the street I know her by her ass When I go by the street I know her by her ass Let's go, my brother, a guy can easily lose his head here. Aye Milutin, let me lose my head and my money once a month. Miško! What is it? Let me go! Let me go, what did I do? Let me go! Comrade Chief... We just caught this bastard. Alright, go on now! - Go on! - Understood! Understood. You too, black Milutin? - It's not... - Others' habits... foreign to our society, import habits, bordello habits... And you see, in the report... not one word about where those habits came from. Who got you into all this? - An accident. - An accident? Alright, Milutin... if it's an accident, why not go to a concert accidentally? Our concert hall sits empty. We're embarrassed before the world. And does your unfortunate woman know about this? She doesn't. And she doesn't have to know. Just sign this, Milutin. - This? - Yes. Never. We have a Director Like none in Montenegro... - Đuro! - Yes? What is this, for God's sake? We went out into the world, my Milutin. - What world? - To Kinshasa. Director Todor announced that he made a deal. A big deal. The Party Secretary ordered it to be celebrated. I don't know anything about it. Me neither, by God. - Here's Milutin! - We don't go for the worse Instead we go to the boss... We have a Director Like none in Montenegro Why are you shivering, poor Milutin, they're dying of heat here. I don't know what's wrong with me. The Director came from afar before but I was never like this. There... like you're his mistress. Woman... I'm a little scared for the man. Don't be scared for him... he's coming as a hero. Attention! For those interested, the plane from Belgrade on line number... Comrade Maksim... This is Party Secretary Milutinović. What happened? You weren't vigilant enough, Comrade Party Secretary. Give a little, explain to people. Say... he messed up! But that's not enough. Not enough? Fine, fine, leave it to me. We need to know what's up! We need to know where he is! We need to know why he was taken! You're right. Comrade Director, good day. Welcome to our machinery. This is where cars are repaired, new parts are made, and so on. - What are you doing, Comrade? - Savatije! Changing the links, Comrade Director. They're broken. It can't be fixed at all. It can, it can. Try without links, Comrade. How without links, Comrade Director? - Where there's a will, there's a way. - Of course it can. Who's this one laughing? Todor's driver. A big problem. Get rid of him. Of course. Of course, Comrade Director. Don't worry, Milutin. Nothing lasts forever. You have to show your teeth. Shout at them, Milutin. Don't worry, you have Mira... and we're all with you. What is it? Want me to give you a ride? You, in this shit truck? I won't drive this forever. Bless you, Milutin, you have a fiery woman. He doesn't even see it! Stop coming around my house, Gavrilo. If she's lucky, we could both come around. You! Get that stench out of here! Go inside! Milutin, come out. What do you need? My Milutin... we've had enough of you. Gavrilo, take the keys. Stop! What keys, what are you talking about? The new Director is waiting to go on a trip. Gavrilo... get in. Wait, stop a minute! Explain to me what's going on here. An official statement will be issued. Mrs. Marika... Comrade Maxim is here. What's going on? The situation is like this. You couldn't understand it. But it's terrible! It can't be that terrible. I'm here to give you a hand. You know what the people are saying? The people? Never mind the people. That's my concern. What about the kids... reputation... and me? Alright, when the time comes... we'll rehabilitate him. Can you do it now? This was a monastery residence built in 1389. Somewhere in the twelfth century. Now we've... refurbished it... dressed it up... and it works. Come in! C'mon! What is it, get comfortable! Oh, you bitch! I'll arrest you... and let him go. Come! Come, my sis! I'll be happy... your husband free... better for everyone. Where are you going? Wait, poor thing. We just got here. What do you say, your honor? And the last stronghold... of our Comrade Director Todor fell! How does she fuck? Like a champ! We went at it for three days. When will you give me a bit? But you know! What happened? They took my house! We'll manage somehow. What will I do, I have no house! Don't worry, Marika, you have us. You're crazy. - You bring evil to my house. - Shut up! I can't leave Todor's wife and kids on the street. Todor will fuck you over, if he hasn't already. Let that Todor go, for God's sake! Why are you stuck to him? It'll ruin us! You brought that enemy element's wife and kids to my house! He's no enemy element! - He's not guilty! - And me? What am I guilty of? No one's entered my house for days! Like we're infected! You don't have to argue anymore. We're going to leave. You're not going to leave. Todor left you in my care. Good morning, people. Are you alright? Boss, good morning. Milutin... Take them, Mićo. These are your keys... and this is your vehicle. I should drive the shit truck? If you don't want to... you don't have to. But you're feeding two families, Mićo. Jole! Jole... Could you give me that cabin? Why do you need a cabin? You have a cabin with your Todor. The lady needs a cabin, I'll get in line. What's this? Comrade lady's ass is different from the others? Will you give me the cabin or not? What's with you, man? Get in line like all the rest! C'mon, get in line! My beautiful baby Love is not a joke Why are you taking up the whole road? C'mon, get that stench out of here! It'll stink up my limousine! Where are you going? I'm waiting for my Director. The Director's not here now! - You heard what he said? - Noted! Make a report! You're waiting for your Todor? He's gone, now it's our time! We'll see about that! C'mon, drive, drive! If you were any good, you wouldn't be driving that shit truck! To each his own! Listen, Mira! You have to get married. To get married? I'm already married. And the late Sićo was alive and well until yesterday, so... now you see. You have to marry... the new Director's driver. - That shithead? - An assignment! The new Director is a proven cadre, but... we must monitor the situation. I love Milutin. A mistake, Mira, a mistake. I had you married... on assignment, and you fall in love! I guess I have a soul too. My sis, your soul is committed to our ideals. Where are you going at this hour? To "Three Hats". Ladies' night. Good God, woman... that was an accident. I'll go accidentally too. It's nothing. The woman just changed drivers! It couldn't be more fair on your part. When he drives your car, let him drive your wife. What the, who the hell...! Little red bird on a high branch... Go to sleep. What happened, Milutin? I was looking for that whore, to kill her! You won't go to jail for her! She broke my heart. - Do you want dinner? - No, no, no. Go to sleep. My Milutin... I know how you feel. I'll be here for you... as much as I can. Don't worry. I'll kill her! Where are you going? Stop! Let her go! It's not easy for her either. Take a walk in the mountains, Oh girl... Milutin... You're sleeping. No I'm not, but I thought of something. Come on out. Is this any way to maintain a vehicle, Milutin? This is exactly how I know it. From now on, it has to shine. Look at the garage... It too has to shine, Milutin. I have nothing to do with the garage! You do, Milutin, you do. And look at the Director's Mercedes, how dusty it is. So what? I don't drive the Director's Mercedes. It too... has... to shine, Milutin. You know who cleans the Director's Mercedes! Yes, but... Gavrilo needs to sleep longer. He just got married. Didn't your Mira promise to get him released? - Yes. - You see. And what Mira says, that will happen. Better to not release him. What? What will Radoje say when he finds out I'm not a virgin! Oh, that. How can I look him in the eye? C'mon, your Mira will take care of it for you. I know a doctor... He'll patch you up... Soon you'll be like the day you were born for your Radoje. Ah, it's you! What do you want? Come out and I'll tell you both! You said everything you had to! I didn't, come out! Listen, get out of here! I'll call my Gavrilo! That little turd? And now I'll fuck you and him both! Milutin, Milutin Beautiful girl Milutin Milutin! Come here, black Milutin, drink some water. It's cold as ice. Milutin... Come out. I came out. Give me the vehicle keys. Why? What do you mean why? You misused the vehicle! You endangered citizens' safety! You'll be assigned to a new job. You'll take care of our housing's beautiful appearance. Really? Here you go. What's up? Give it here. Who is it? The Party Secretary. What's up? C'mon, talk, we're alone. C'mon, you see there's no one! - He went with Jelka to Ozrinići. - Do you have photos? - I'm out of film. - Out of film? Get out! Scram! He's out of film? How long will I stand here while no one asks anything? Šćepo! Are we going to the motel in Kolašin tonight? A bit of lamb. But look, I have one job to take care of before that. I'll tell you about it... Bye, see you soon. Comrade Chief... I have to go to work! Your hands, your hands... Sleep. Where have you been, Milutin? You're waiting for him in vain. He's at my boarding house tonight. What do you want? Everything could be fine with your husband. Really? And how can I thank you? You know, my sis. What do you want, you animal? Let me go! Let me go, pig! You'll come to beg... on your knees! So you're fucking Todor's wife? God bless you, Comrade Chief! I know, I know. You went after... that poor thing... How can you say that? Me? You, you! Who the hell are you to fuck... the wives of my detainees? Me to arrest and you to fuck! No kidding! Well, I'll show you! Get out of here! In the evening at my boarding house again! Here after work from 2! Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Hello. - How's it going? - Not too bad. - Good morning, Đuro. - Hello, hello. - Good morning. - Good morning. Where are you going? What do you mean? You got fired. Fired? An order. - Whose order? - Back off! Back off! Move it! Scram! Comrade President. Comrade Party Secretary. - Department head. - Comrade Party Secretary... - Comrade Party Secretary... - I know what you'll say, Milutin. I really can't help you at the moment. I'm not asking for myself! It's not the right time. Let me go, people, what's with you? Come in! - Good day. - Good day. I have an appointment. Just a minute. Comrade President... Milutin is here. Go in. Good day. I hear... Milutin... that in this city of mine... you seek some justice for Todor. Comrade President... Just say it. Just so you know, no one will take us off our course. No one... not even you and your instigators. Can I say something? Milutin... We gave you a chance. We'll give you one more chance. And that's the end of our patience. The comrades from waterworks are here. Let them in. We're finished. So... I hope we had a nice conversation. You brought up a problem... Now it all depends on you. Milutin... What's going on now, for God's sake? C'mon, calm down, don't cry. We'll think of something. I must think of something. Son! Is it really you! Look, look who came to us! By God, good of you to remember us. C'mon, sit down, sit down. I won't ask how you are. I heard it all! I came for your help. Your business, child. Forget politics. What politics? I'd just bring Todor's family to live here with you. The door is always open for you here. But I'm too old to be your Todor's hideout. Wait a minute! Give me that. This will be great. Look. Hold it here. Wait. Jovan, Toša! Marko! Pero! Come here! Here! Stevan! C'mon! C'mon quick, let's help the people. Obren! Quick, come here! Thank you. Who are you making dinner for, Marika? Who am I making it for? The kids... Milutin... How long do you plan to cook for my man? Yours, is he? He's not yours. Get out of here! Who are you... whore! Go away, I'll call Milutin! - Whose Milutin? - My Milutin! Let her go, damn it... - You came, whore-lover! - Let her go! I won't give him up! - You got me into this, you shit! - Who's a shit? - You're a shit! - I'm a shit? Leave him alone! Don't touch him. Now I'll give you some shit. If I'm a shit... Hold the witch! Hold her! Hold her, damn it! You're stronger! Where are you taking me! Help! Help... Help! You see. Thumbs... here, hold like that... Then now... pull slowly. Hold still, hold still! Here, like that... Less! It's just a breast, don't be afraid! Go on! Like that. What did you do? Where is she? Here is our new nest. - Does your wife know about this? - No, by God. Look here. The tennis courts will be here. Here... an Olympic pool with sea water. But I don't know how to swim. I don't either. Let's go! What are you gaping at? C'mon, get out! - Why! - Still asking? Illegal construction! Do you have a warrant? A warrant? I'll show it to you now. Stop! Alright... I'll talk with the Chief. Raise it! C'mon, tell me now... am I better than your Director? I have kids, Maksim. You got what you wanted. Now let my man go. Just a little longer. He could disturb us. We'll put the kids in an orphanage. There it'll be... better than with a father like that. He lived for orders, not for children. A careerist. That's why we sent him for re-education. In a word, this society needs a healthy family. What is it, Mitar? You know who I have inside? I know. But a great misfortune happened, Comrade Chief. What, did a war start? Even worse. The Fourth Plenum was held. So what if it was held? Here... Look. They'll arrest us all. "... in serious abuses by State Security. " I did everything honestly. Honorably... I worked day and night, you know. Guarded the achievements... I deserve an order, not prison. Aye, of course you do. But it says here they'll send some kind of commission. Commission? If they came to me, I'd arrest them all. Go to the office, I'll be right there! Certain State Security bodies, using modern technology... embarked in recent years... on large-scale surveillance operations of individuals and institutions. Who's on duty here? Me! Get the keys, let everyone go! - Everyone? - Everyone! - Husbands too? - Husbands and bachelors! Sort it out later! - Is the warden here? - In number 8. Yo, Majo! What are you doing, Zvonko, for fuck's sake, what yo? - Come here! - What, Majo, for God's sake? - Is Todor here? - I think... - Let him go! - Tonight? Keys in hand and out with him! What are you talking about? We hold him for so long and now suddenly he's out? - We haven't even questioned him... - Question him quickly. Say the investigation is over. Have him sign and out with him! - They can't find him here! - Who? Listen... do as I told you... and don't ask so many questions, okay? Hello. Did you hear? I heard everything... You fucked up. You arrested the husbands, not me. Fine, but we fucked their women together. Wait a minute... Look... I have a brilliant plan. I don't know if you'll agree with it. You do whatever you want, just leave me out of it! Fine... Fine, fine. I'll do it myself. - Who is it? - State police! What do you want? C'mon, man, open up. Don't be afraid. We have a warrant. Milutin! State police. State police? Come in. We have a warrant to evacuate Comrade Marika... and the children. Evacuate them where? To a specified place. At night? That's the order. Comrade Marika... Get ready. I'm not going anywhere without Milutin. We don't have a warrant for him. Then get one. Why am I arguing with you? Pack. I won't let you! Miško! Leave him alone! I'll go! I'll go! Miško! What is this, people? - Where are we going at this hour? - You're going to Kinshasa. What Kinshasa? And I'm unprepared like this? You have tickets and a visa. The plane takes off at 5. Why is it so sudden, man? We got orders to put you on a plane, and you still know your job. All good. We were ordered to put you in this house. Don't worry about anything, please. Just don't try to run away. We have strict orders! Here you go. Comrade Maksim... I'm in a hurry! Do you know maybe... where they took Marika and the kids? Who took them, what are you talking about, fool? I saw with my own eyes! Listen, you need to learn once and for all not to believe your eyes too much, Milutin... poor thing. Marika is with the children where she's always been. If you don't believe me, go see for yourself. Let Uncle Gavrilo take you. Let's go. Here you go. There. Let's let Uncle Gavrilo take the children. There. Here he is. Whoa. Hold on, hold on. Neighbor! Spasoje! Wasn't my house here? I don't know anything... I'm in a hurry... - I have work. - You're in a hurry? But you helped me build a house here. Leave me alone. Gavrilo! What is it? - Gavrilo... - What? - Give me the keys. - What keys? Keys to the vehicle. What keys? To the vehicle. Why? An order came to return the keys. Huh? The keys! - Keys, give me the keys! - Keep away! Get him! Gavrilo, give me the keys, poor thing! Are you crazy? Catch him, faster, faster! See, I kept my promise. Here's my man. C'mon now. I talked to the Director, everything is fine for the job, a little patience for the apartment. Go on, go on. Where have you been, Milutin? Your pie is getting cold. C'mon, eat. Director Todor is looking for you everywhere. You have to go... on the road again. Here are the keys. Someone is crazy here. I don't think it's me. Bless you, Milutin... it's certainly not you. C'mon, eat, change, then hurry... don't keep people waiting. Where is your husband? What husband? Aren't you my husband? What is it, Milutin? You want me to brew you some tea? A friendly song is sung A song... Listen, Todor... The situation requires... that this time you spent rejuvenating... forget it like it never even existed. For everyone, you were in Kinshasa. Even for your family. And for yourself, of course. Yes. I understand the situation. So, wave a little then... Smile a little. Smile at the people. A friendly song is sung A song celebrating work Let our hearts speak loudly For us to celebrate, celebrate work! Let our hearts speak loudly For us to celebrate, celebrate work! Comrades... here I am... just now... successfully returning from... Kinshasa. I stayed a little longer for objective reasons. We will build a factory in Kinshasa and it will be... the start of our entrance into the world... and our international affirmation. A more detailed report... will be provided by the self-governing body. Well, people, what are you looking for here? Gojko, what is this? Look, Maksim... It's awkward to have to tell you but... we're a commission here to check for abuse of office. Abuse of office? And what did I abuse? First of all... you wiretapped all the bedrooms in town. If you don't know how people breathe, how can you monitor the situation? Man, you even wiretapped the City Committee Secretary's room. I have to know how the Party breathes. I have no exceptions. I'm principled. Even my own room... I wiretapped. I know, I know... You never sleep at home anyway. You spend nights with your detainees' wives. - I know where you sleep. - Me? You. That's slander. Dear God... Dear God, what's happening... to so much work... to so much vigilance... Time to take a break from your vigilance, Maksim. And you! If you worked differently, this wouldn't have happened! - I messed up, Comrade Chief. - Messed up? I couldn't tell you everything. Couldn't tell me everything? - You hid something? - Not me, but... You hid something? Alright. Miško! Play the film, Miško! - Film? - Yes! Why is my wife there? Take, take, take, take it. That's it. Whisper something to him. Stop that. Let's sing. - Sing, sing. - Do you hear? As palm trees rock their branches And the whole city sleeps While flowers on trees smell You kiss, you kiss me. While flowers on trees smell... Marika... What's going on? Nothing special is going on, Milutin. You must have heard that Todor came back... from Kinshasa. From Kinshasa? Yes, Milutin. From Kinshasa. Come in, Milutin, what do you need? The Director is in a hurry. Best to stop by in two days. Please. So... It's been a long time... I came to greet you. I missed you. Thank you. Please. What do you need? Nothing, I don't need anything. I just wanted to tell you... about some people while you were in prison. What are you saying? In what prison? So you were in Kinshasa? Get the car keys and let's go on a trip. Let go of Kinshasa now. I won't, by God. Will you tell me where you've been? In Kinshasa, fool. Why don't you tell me? I was in Kinshasa. You were in prison! I was in Kinshasa. In prison! In Kinshasa. In prison! - In Kinshasa! - In prison, liar! In prison! - Take him away! - In prison, liar! What happened? - Imagine, he attacked the Director! - Him? You rotten punk! Scram! Scram, bastard! Scram!
