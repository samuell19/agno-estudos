Turn the music down! MAXIE WANDER GOOD MORNING, MY LOVELY EARLY SUMMER, 1989, EAST BERLIN CLUB COLA IS SOLD OUT Hello. Don't you have a couple more bottles? If the sign says we're out of Cola, we're out. Try again next week. Hello. How's school going? Just a couple more weeks, then it'll finally be over. Well? My favorite part was when she said... "Everyone wants to find the right man, then all will be well. But I want to find myself, not someone else." One day I'll write something like that. A man in bed now and then isn't bad either. Here's something special for you, but be careful. Thank you. Tell your dad to come by when he has time. - My carburetor is acting up. - I'll tell him. Think she wants to have sex with Dad? I hope not. Dear Mom, not long now and I'll be a student at last. Then I'll sleep till midday, write books, and just do whatever I want. What do we have here? - What do you want from me? - ID. I'm on my way to a Free German Youth meeting. But not with that on your shoulder. Come with us. NATIONAL POLICE Get inside. Who would treat the uniform of the Free German Youth this way? Susanne Schulz. 1984, by George Orwell. Published by Ullstein. Who'd you get it from? IN A COUNTRY THAT NO LONGER EXISTS BASED ON A TRUE STORY Thanks. Try number 22. You're not here by choice, right? No. Stop mumbling. What? No, I'm not. - What did she do wrong? - Don't know. Just what we needed. Doesn't look like she's good for anything. The truth is stubborn. Lenin said that. Let's see what she can do. Three minutes. I waited over an hour yesterday at the phone booth. - Good morning. - Good morning. I want you to give Schulz some support. You're candidates for the next bonus. Work hard. And help her when she needs it. Yes. Come here. This... This is your chance to prove yourself. To become a worthy member of our Socialist society. What will your personal contribution be? "My job, my battleground for peace"? It says here you wanted to go to college. Study literature. It's not a hard question. Let her drill a few holes first. She'll then have time to think about it. Maybe she'll learn something here. Hi, Rainer, it's Klaus. Listen... My oldest daughter Susanne has been expelled from school and assigned to Socialist factory work. You have connections at the Ministry. They found something in her things. Orwell's 1984. What? Oh, shit. Yes, of course. I can do that. Is it the Wartburg? Sure, bring the car over. Thanks. Bye. Rainer said we're lucky it wasn't worse. But I wanted to go to college, Dad. Someone in Karl-Marx-Stadt got two years in prison for that book. MY SPECIAL GIRL! ALWAYS REMEMBER, WE ARE ONLY FREE WHEN WE DREAM! I'M PROUD OF YOU! YOUR MOM Hey Sven! Get me the Astler for the 110. And be quick! No. Turn it off. Open it. What's that supposed to be? Art? Look. You need to drill the holes in the corners. Got it? Do it again. And this part isn't getting any coolant. Look. It's already very hot. See that? It's dangerous. You have to be careful. Do it again. No. Not so hard. You have to go real slow. Wait. Like this. Feel it? Good. Go ahead. What's this? - What? It's me! - Dry your hands first. - How'd you get into the Sibylle? - Let me see it. Let me see it! - I was on the tram and this guy... - Yeah, right. You were just on the tram, and now you're in the Sibylle. Plus, I'm much prettier than you. Dear Sibylle, my name is Kerstin Schulz. I'm 12 years old. I attend the German-Soviet Friendship School. I want to become a model, so I thought I'd ask if you could print a picture of me in your magazine. Just like you did of my sister Suzi. Her real name is Susanne, but my mom always called her Suzi, after Suzi Quatro. Mom died last year. Please write back. My address is Lübbenauer Weg 13, 1187 Berlin. I'm free anytime. Kerstin. Oh, sweetie. Don't look so sad. Rub some Florena on your fingers. They'll be as good as new. Have you thought of anything? Baking for the bazaar? Or playing music at the company party? Remember, you have to prove yourself. I don't know how to bake. But you have to do something. Or we won't get the bonus, and the girls will be really pissed off. You could write something for the company magazine. What should I write about? I once dreamed of another life too. I wanted to be a stewardess. Fly around the world. Oh well. Come on, you can manage the bit of Socialist production. What if I don't want to? Whether you want to or not, you better get used to it. I know what you're thinking. But that's not how it is. They won't keep us from singing Not from singing or spreading cheer We must keep our high spirits High spirits and a little joy Suzi, can you believe it? They wrote back to me. They really wrote back. "Dear Kerstin, thank you for your letter." You're still too young to be a model. But we liked your sister. She should come by. VHB Exquisit, Brunnenstraße 1. "Sibylle." Who wrote to you? Can I come? Please. - Can you explain this? - I'm going to be a model. No one is going to be a model. We said no more trouble. You think I like repairing cars after work SO you can have a shot at college? - I didn't do anything. - You call this nothing? Now you've got your sister involved as well. Klaus! Tell her to stop once and for all. Stay out of my business! Will you read to me? I won't stay in that factory. I don't care what he says. Read now. "Go away, you great, black bird." Fear grows beneath your wings' shadow. But I am not afraid. For I am strong and believe in a miracle. "" Hey! You forgot something. The Swedes. Great. Very nice. Turn again. Timeless. Classic. Close-fitting but flowing. Beige is a very human, lively color with limitless... Marion! What's this? It's unimaginative and bland. This isn't Brigitte. You can be old, but not beige. - I need more elegance. - No. - Beige stands for quality of life. - What life? So, honey, what are you looking for? This is me. I was told to come by. - You know the sketches have to be approved? - Yes, I know. And we have to photograph the collection before the Leipzig Fair? Yes, but I also know you can do it. This is her. She was told to come by. Walk back and forth in those. Go ahead. Well, get going. We don't have all day. Thank you. Okay. - Which do you like best? - One and three. One and three... I know you. Hello. Where do you go so early on the tram? KWO. What do you do at KWO? I'm training to be a metal cutter. A what? A metal cutter. Drilling holes in metal, milling gears. That kind of thing. That's the cover for the new issue. Our women. Socialist women... in the factory. Where? The Cable Works. Setting: At the workbench. Face: This girl. And then he looked at you, and you looked at him? - And then? - Nothing. Are you in love? Don't be silly. I won't fall in love. Men are just in the way. That's what Mom always said. You're lucky I'm bringing you along as my assistant. When do I get to take pictures again? You know your file. I can't print you till the Ministry says so. You know that. Let's get started. I've never seen clothes like that at the store. It's real silk, isn't it? It's next season's collection. - It'll all go to the West anyway. - No, it's all staying here. I doubt it. You can't wear it anyway. - And you can? Look at yourself. - Sure. I'm natural. I can even go naked. Hey! Just like a model! Here, honey. So? Take a look at yourself. Take a look at yourself. What do you see? A pretty dress. But who makes the dress? Me? Give the dress your personality. You're pretty, but lots of people are pretty. Beauty is deeper down. It comes from within you. Now show me there's something special in you. First they send her to me to knock her off her high horse and then all this fuss. What's the point? Let's just take a short break from our Socialist education. Loosen up. You'll manage, Petzke... And turn around. And now smile, please. Smile. Not so rigid. That's it. Into the camera. Relax. Hans. Come here a second? Want to show me where you work? Show me. ONWARD IN THE FIGHT FOR PEACE AND SOCIALISM That's my machine. This is my workpiece. How does it work? You put this in here. Not exactly regulation work clothes, huh? That's right. But those are? - Yes. - Get in the picture. Okay. Move a little closer. You have to be in the picture. What should I do? Just be yourself. Very nice. - And you? - What? - Get in the picture. - No. Come on. Go on. Do it. - What about you? - Me? Yes, you. No way. Like proper models. What's your name? - Marina. - Marina. Please take that box there and stand on it. Laugh a little. Look here. Very good. We're going to be models. Second career. Not your first time, is it? Your shift isn't over yet. I want to see you back on the floor in five minutes. Do you always do it like that? I do what I want. I'm an antisocial subject. I'm an antisocial subject too. You're pretty. Schulz! This is my address. I'll teach you to walk properly. I have to work here. If Elsa wants you, you won't have to work here anymore. Rudi, you have a customer. - Hey there. - Hi. Who wants a beer? Hey, little metal worker. What's all this stuff for? We're GBA. What are you? Glamorous. Beguiling. A la mode. GBA. That's us. We're doing our own fashion show. I want to do something big. With music, and ropes from the ceiling. And... why? For fun. For us. And now come up out of the water. Up. Wonderful. And... So much fuss, just for that? I too want to be the prettiest of them all. Back straight, chest out. Hips out front. On your toes. Turn, smile... and back again. As if you'd never done anything else. You are the queen. Don't worry... What I have, I don't want to lose But where I am, I don't want to stay But the ones I love, I don't want to leave But the ones I know, I can't bear to see Where I live, I don't want to die And where I die, I don't want to be I want to stay where I've never been Stop distracting me. Hey, comrades. I know a reporter with Stern. He wants to do a story. I'd love to take your picture for him. To get that Stasi feeling. Easy, my friend! - Where were you? - At Rudi's. There are people there you can't imagine. They do what they want. Just like that. For fun. So what? I do too. Kerstin, they want me to become a model. Tomorrow is the audition. I have to make it. But I want to become a model. It's my dream. And you still can, but... you're a bit too young. How do I look? I'll tell Dad. Don't you dare. Give it to me. Mom gave it to me. Then leave! Just like Mom did. I'm not leaving. But you have to promise not to tell Dad. Even if you're mad at me. I'll read something to you. What are you doing? Smoking makes you older. Do you think Mom can see us? Yes. The pants are suitable for everyday use. Is this the Swedish material? - Really nice, isn't it? - Yes. Can you turn around? The back is wonderful. That's a bit problematic. We'll improve that. It's a minor detail. You're done. Where have you been? Sit down. Professor? - Steffen. - Professor. Hello. Okay, kids, let's get started. Leni Strahl. Turn around, please. And lift the arms. And now from the back. Give me another full turn. And... from the back again. Thank you. Susanne Schulz, please. Knock 'em dead. Rolf? Steffen, will you excuse us? Yes. I want that girl. A bit extravagant, but good. Who shot them? Coyote. What? No one knows. She won't do. Who should I take to Leipzig if you disqualify every other one? She was expelled from high school. Good heavens. You can't tell by looking at her. Why do some get chosen and others don't? Bye. Why can some go to college, and others can't? Why can some leave the country and others will never be allowed? None of it makes sense. And that's what they want. For us to never feel safe and always be scared. But we're not. I am. Never give them the right to decide who you are. Understand? Now stop whining. Come on. Tomorrow is Saturday. We're going to the coast. Come with us. It'll cheer you up. We're faced with challenges in the supply chain. So we have to make sure... Wait a second. If you ever have a problem, come to me. Maybe I can help you. I have a daughter your age. Where were we? Right, supply chains. Why do you put up with it? Why let one of you enjoy herself in the afternoon while the rest work to meet your quota? Why don't you do anything about it? Come on, Petzke, you're so proud of us. No, Gisela. You all have a responsibility. Some of you lift the collective up. Others drag it down. So I doubt you'll get the bonus. - What? - Without discipline, you have nothing. Figure it out, how to fix it. - Petzke... - No, Gisela. Go! I'm really fed up. I don't want her in our brigade anymore. Let's vote. Who wants her out? Petzke is serious about Socialism. That's good. Someone has to be. Let's focus on how to work this out. You're a good writer. Write to him about what you did wrong. He'll like that. Okay. You're not one of us. I didn't choose to be here. Me neither. But unlike you, this is my life. That's enough! Check this out. Look at that. That's us! Look at that! Look at that! What's going on between Coyote and her? - He makes women unhappy. - Why? Why? Who cares why? He just does. Come on. Let's get in the water. Let's go! In the evening, this turns into border territory. I prefer shadowy and dismal scenes. Somber and full of skepticism about life in East Germany. Why somber and dismal? That's what my file says. The Ministry banned my pictures from being printed. Could you turn the light on? I refused to serve in the Army and wasn't allowed to study photography. You want a beer? Yes. Thank you. I wanted to be a writer. College and all that. I don't read books. - Why not? - Life is my teacher. Don't think so much. You can't control it anyway. Just act. And you'll see what happens. And your photos? They're the place I'd like to be. But it's not outside. Or with a specific person. It's... It's inside here. The energy has to come from inside. I feel it when the right picture comes along. It's like a thunder storm. You know from the beginning, with the first lightning flashes far off, what it will be like. And... then it starts... to crackle, and the air is full of electricity. I get this... excited feeling in my belly, like I can't wait for it to happen. And then it's suddenly here, the moment. Then I press the button. And I'm happy. Is this your plan now? Pictures like this? - Yes. - Is this your plan? Why throw it all away? I can't go to college anyway. You can't just give up. - I'm not going to be a writer either. - Why not? Because I don't want to change who I am. Because I want to be free. And because |I... never want to become like you. Dad? What are you doing? Open up! No. Kerstin? Have you all gone crazy? Open the door! You promised not to leave me. Dad! He went to see Mrs. Heinemann. Come on, open up. I'll give you my tape recorder. - I already took it. - Why are you taking my stuff? Because you're never here. Please, Kerstin. You know what Mom always said. We have to stick together. Let's stick together now. Professor? Come in. The world's decline... can only be halted by elegance. And these shoes are not up to the task. What kind of shoes do you wear? Show me. Come here. Shoes with heels lengthen the leg. You should wear pumps. Sit down. You can take her, but make sure she knows what is expected of her. Okay. Of course. I'm not sure I should take you to Leipzig. Why not? - You're not passionate. - Yes, I am. Really? What do you have? What can you do? What are you good at? Maybe it's a problem that I don't... There are no problems, only challenges. Give me one reason why you want to be a model. I don't want to drill holes any more. One. I can't stay there. I can't do it. And I'm not a reservoir for failures. This is about beauty. Do you know what beauty is? Beauty is a promise that there is a place of peace beyond mediocrity. Beauty soothes the nerves. Beauty is not a good intention but a fact. Beauty is provocation, rigor. Responsibility. And beauty has its price. Dear Mom, I'm going to take this chance. Sometimes we have to take detours to find happiness. Just like you always said. Quiet down. Quiet down. Please quiet down! Okay, girls, for the newbies... The fashion show in Leipzig... Uta, are you listening? The fashion show in Leipzig is the most important event of the year. It's our presentation to Sindermann and the Party. - Please remember the security protocols. - You'd better dress warmly. Break a leg, girls! Why? Are you undressing again? Why are you even here? What do you have to do for it? - Are you crazy? - Stop it! Instead of behaving like adults you act like children. I'm watching you. My dear Horst Sindermann. My dear comrade. I'm so happy you've found the time again to review our presentation for the new season. I wouldn't miss it for the world. You're clear. Please share one. - You're late again. - Rudi! - Yeah? - It won't open. It does now. I love this mad frenzy. This is haute couture. - Three stitches. - Okay. Rudi, where does the TV go? On the table. BERLIN IS DULL WITHOUT YOU. I'll WAIT FOR YOU AFTER THE SHOW. YOUR ANTISOCIAL SUBJECT What's that? A letter from the comrades? You'd better watch it. Yes. You'll be fine. - We're really excited. - It'll be worth it. I tell you, it'll be worth it. Our collection is of the highest quality and long-lasting. We want to define a specific style of life by raising the aesthetic level. And thus enhancing the attractiveness of everyday life. Leni, off you go. - You're dead, you snitch. - What's her problem? Don't let it get to you. What are you two doing out there? - Have you lost your mind? - Did you see that? - Don't make a scene. - Don't do that again! I can't go back out there. - Pull yourself together. - No. Yes. I'm warning you. Don't do that again. Not the suitcase. Does anyone have an idea what's going on out there? What got into you? - It's broken. - Nonsense. You know how important the wedding dress is. - Get moving. - No way. It's broken. I can't even stand up. Well, sometimes... the magic lies in improvisation. The climax of our presentation will open up a whole new field which will help increase our image internationally. They're pretty, our Socialist women. Well, most of them anyway. And smile. Look into the camera. And the flower again. Smile. Get on. It's important for us to ask whether people are happy or unhappy. Fulfilling their needs plays a crucial part. Because fashion is change. And change meets with resistance. We know yesterday. We have to think towards tomorrow. The success of our work is unstoppable, and is now taking us... to Paris, where we are going to open a counter at Galerie Lafayette. Here's to you! You have a promising future ahead of you. I'm delighted. Thanks for meeting with us, Ms. Schulz. Have a seat. Have a seat, please. We would like... also in the name of Comrade Sindermann, to thank you for what you did. One could say you... saved the day. How did it come to this? What do you mean? When did Rudolf Schramm plan his stunt, and who was involved? I don't know anything about a plan. And no one was involved. Was Uta Krumbiegel in on it? She was supposed to wear the bridal gown. She broke her foot. Did you know about it? - About what? - Was Frank Diller at the show? - Who? - He calls himself Coyote. Ah, Coyote. Okay then. So was this Coyote also in Leipzig? You made a good impression in Leipzig. You just need to put your commitment in writing, and the professor will request you be freed from factory work and you'll never have to go back to the KWO. Bravo. You can't be serious. Just don't tell anyone. You know about it. No one wants only the little finger. It's always the whole hand, chérie. No. What is it worth to you to live your dream? Where were you? I was arrested, and Elsa fired me. A gay bride was too much for them. By the way, we're meeting tomorrow at the old barracks to set up the show. Can you bring the fluorescent lamps? I swear this show... will be the most exciting and greatest thing that's ever happened in this city. Cheers. Come. How do you do it? How do you turn all the bad into something good? I've been through it so many times. They arrest me, they let me go. I get fired, they rehire me. Why aren't you afraid? We have each other. What could happen? - I have to tell you something. - Me too. You've gotten inside of me. In my head, in my body, everywhere. You're even in here... Don't worry. I'm not asking you to marry me. I just want you to love me. You're crying. Is that a good sign? Or bad? I have to tell you something. What? The Stasi interrogated me. What? Can you help me? Sure. ID. Did you see? They're already checking us. You here? Where does this go, Rudi? In the back. The Stasi arrested Coyote because you betrayed him. They picked him up in a car. Are you crazy? - I saw it. - Wow, Uta. Stop it. I didn't betray him. Rudi... I don't believe you anymore. When you talk to the Stasi, you're out. Coyote. There you are. Leave me be. What's wrong? I'm a naive... idiotic stupid cow. Go away. Why are you doing this? I can't stay here. No way. Get out. Get out! GDR FASHION AMONG THE WORLD'S ELITE Fare thee well, beautiful wild wolf of the prairie, most talented of all. What are these pictures? - How did they get in there? - How indeed... Coyote saw his chance and took it. He's an exceptional photographer. He'll make his way. Coyote was arrested. No. - He took off. - Never. I don't believe you. But sadly... sadly Rudi had to pay the price. And sadly... sadly... we have to sacrifice our friends sometimes. Sadly everything has its price. What will happen to Rudi? Rudi is like a cat. He always lands on his feet. Always. Rudi? Have you heard? The hottest guy in town isn't in jail after all. He's also gone over to the West. What happened here? I never betrayed anyone or anything! Hey, sweetie! Don't laugh. Help me. Want some? No. Did you hear? Petzke didn't give us the bonus. He'll be eating his lunches alone for a while. The girls are really pissed off. But what did I tell you? It never turns out the way you think. It's always much worse. It's so great, you in Sibylle. Your pictures everywhere. Just like a real star. My brother-in-law also has a crush on you. He works in the morgue. He said you can drop by anytime if you want to see a corpse. Why would I want to see a corpse? How would I know? But that's how he got my sister. He took her through the morgue one night, and then he kissed her. Now tell me. What's on your mind? I made my decision. I'm coming back. You're one of us. And it's important that we're a collective. That we're there for one another. And even if Petzke didn't give us the bonus... I like him. And that he believes in something bigger than himself. And it's important to fight for a better world. And don't get me wrong, but... you don't belong here. I know. Sweetie... We're back on. On what? The show. We're doing the show. We have no costumes. Right. Then we make new ones. Shower curtains and plastic sheets are out. It's over, Suzi. It's over. - Gisela's brother-in-law works at the morgue. - So what? The bodies are wrapped in plastic. Corpse wrap. Glamorous, beguiling, and a la mode with corpse wrap? No one has the right to decide who we are. If we give up now, they will have won, not us. Oh, God. I hope you miss us. To Coyote! Hey, pretty... Come on. Now we don't have to fight over the same guy. Do you know how crazy you are? Yes, I do. Listen up. These fine clothes are produced at VHB Exquisit. One of these coats costs about a month's salary. No wonder the Stasi was so upset. I think it's cool we're all in Stern. Yeah, but they beat up Rudi. "In the center is Horst Sindermann, President of the Volkskammer." The rest are party bigwigs. They wait all year to see pretty women, and then the bride turns out to be gay. "While officially there are no gay men in East Germany." - To us. - To us! Come on. Is it really for me? I made it myself. - Want to try it on? - Yeah. Thank you. Have you heard anything from Coyote? No, and I don't want to either. Lots of people are escaping through Hungary. Is that your plan too? I don't know. Either you're free, then you're free everywhere, or you're not. Then the West won't help you either. Dad! Let them in. That's my sister. Hello. - Hello. - Hi, Dad. Sweetie! Here's your snow. The others are coming too. Good luck. Come on, Petzke. Dear Mom, only when we dream are we free. I now know what you mean. 3 MONTHS LATER THE WALL COMES DOWN
