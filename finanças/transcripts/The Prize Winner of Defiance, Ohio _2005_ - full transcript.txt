[Man on TV] Win a trip for 12 to anywhere in the free world. Or win a working oil well and have money flowing in for years. That's the grand prize in Dial Soap's big contest. Write a two line jingle starting, "I'm glad I use Dial..." The last word in both lines must rhyme. For example, "I'm glad I use Dial..." [man] Put it across the plate. Jesus Christ, you idiot. There once was a time, believe it or not, when skill and a reasonable amount of luck, could actually feed a family of 12. Come on! Strike 'em out, you sorry, dog-faced bastard! Play ball! Contesting, if you haven't heard of it, was a lucrative way for overworked housewives to use their underused wits. [Typing] It wasn't that I was any more gifted than your average contester, I was simply more determined. I was so prolific, in fact, that I borrowed my children's names so that I could submit more than one entry. This was a perfectly legal tactic in the contesting world, and as far as I could see, one of the advantages of having so many kids. [Baby crying] My creative output usually corresponded directly to our needs. - Hey, Mom. Toaster's broke. - Broken. All right. Hold on. "Kraft's Parkay won't tear fresh bread. Even ice cold, it will smoothly spread." - Here you go, honey. - Thanks, Mom. [Woman] Small household adversities were my steady inspiration. But whenever fate handed one of my kids an unfair blow, it would set my muse on fire. [Baby cooing] [children talking] - Mom. - What, honey? The landlord's here. Oh, hello, Mr. Stubbs. Come on in. [Car horn honks] [children] Dad! Hey, Dad! - [Man] Come on, let me out. - Dad, Dad! - We're being evicted. - Oh, yeah? The landlord came by, says he wants the house back. His daughter's getting married. - How long do we have? - [Boy] Three weeks. - What are we gonna do? - Don't you worry, sweetheart. Mom will always figure something out. - Do you know the capital of Alaska? - No. - Juneau... get it? [Chuckles] - Oh, yeah. Good one. - [Baby cooing] - Hello, Mother. Hello, Dad. I suppose you heard? Yep. Can't seem to catch a break. [Baby laughs] Here, I brought you something. - Thank you, Dad. - Don't choke up so much on the bat. - [Boy] All right, Dad. - Attaboy. Mom, Mom! The men are here to kick us out! Mom! Mom! May I help you? - Mrs. Ryan? - Yes. Is your son, Dick, here? This is Dick. What is this about? Congratulations, son. - You've just won $5,000. - I did? I'm Mr. Forrest, this is Mr. Bravey and Mr. Kramer of the Western Auto Supply Company. Out of 65,000 entries in our national bike contest, you have won the grand prize. - Oh, my goodness. - And that's not all. You've won a brand new Western Fire bicycle and a Westinghouse washer and dryer. - A washing machine? Oh, my lord. - [Forrest] That's right. [Forrest] Mrs. Ryan, are you all right? I just have to sit down and have myself a happy cry. [Children] Dad! We won! Yay, we won! Dad, we won $5,000! - You're kidding. - Isn't it marvelous? - It's awesome! - I told you everything would turn out OK. Congratulations, Kelly. You got quite a wife there. Yep, looks like she got lucky. Dad, Mom says she's gonna put the money down on a new house. - Oh, yeah? - Looks like you're the one who got lucky. Oh, now, Kelly was all set to do it, I just beat him to the punch. [Man] Alrighty. Just need you to sign Dick's check over to Defiance Home Saving and Loan. - Does it matter which one of us...? - Nope. Whoever is over 21. Although, you don't look a day over 19, Mrs. Ryan. Well, in that case, I'd better sign it. Here you go. Okey-doke. And, now the mortgage papers... You need both our signatures, is that correct? Some married couples like to do that. But it's really not necessary. And, after all, I'm the guy who has to pay the mortgage, seems I'm the only one who needs to sign it. And since the bank account's under my name... Sure, that's how most folks do it. Well, that seems right to me. [Clears throat] Well, I guess it's all on me then. Unless Mother here wants to start... ...punching in at the shop. Only if you'll do the ironing, Dad. [Banker laughs] We just need your John Hancock right there. [Kelly] "Kelly... ...Ryan." Well, congratulations, Mr. Ryan. - You are a homeowner, sir. - Thank you. [Kelly] All right, watch that curb. - [Shooting noises] - [baby crying] [laughing] Ooh. Oh, my goodness. Is that what I won? - Yes, ma'am. - [Mrs. Ryan] They're just beautiful. - Watch out. - Excuse me, sir. [Mrs. Ryan] Can you believe it? No more boiling diapers on top of the stove. Yep, gonna miss it. It made a nice soup. Oh, the cost of modern living. Excuse us. We're looking for Mrs. E. Ryan. - There. - Oh, hello. I'm up here. Mrs. Ryan, this is your new deep freeze home freezer. [Mrs. Ryan] Mikey, honey, get down. "Ask any Eskimo and they'll say, frozen keeps the freshness in every day." Oh, my gosh. I forgot all about that one. When it rains, it pours. Down, down, down. Well, bring it on in. [Dick] How's it going, Pop? Don't make your old man carry this couch. Come on. [Dick] OK, on the count of three. One, two, three. Tuff, keep that cat out of the house. - What are you doing, huh? - [Baby cooing] Here. A little bit of this, heh? - [Cooing] - Good? - [Music plays on radio] - [birds singing] - [baby babbles] - Dad, isn't this the biggest freezer you ever seen in your life? It's like the ones in the restaurants. The delivery man told me it would hold two sides of beef. Seems like overkill to me. Besides, it's dangerous. A kid could fall in there and suffocate. - No, we won't, Dad. - I don't want to have to say I told you so. - I'd like to keep it. - What the heck for? Do know how much electricity this thing will eat? Well, it inspires me. It's something to be filled. Well, good luck with that. Even Howard Hughes couldn't fill that thing. Looks like we got plenty in it all ready. - [Laughing] Only dishes, but there's something in there. - Yeah. - That'll take up some of the room, at least. - Mm-hmm. - [Baby crying] - [rhythmic] Oh, oh, oh. [Man on radio] The Red Sox, three, Cleveland, two. [Kelly] Oh! For God's sakes! Bunch of bums, is what you are. - Bunch of bums. - [Radio] The bases are loaded. Writing a winning entry not only requires a modicum of wit, it also requires careful product focus. Notice that I have not one, but two brand names I need to use. You want to know where this is headed? Niagara Falls, straight down. Here's what I have so far. "Wide selections, priced to please her. Scads of Seabrook's in their freezer. Warmth that scorns the impersonal trend. Stamps Big Chief is the housewife's friend." Mom, I left my spelling book in the kitchen. [Kelly muttering] All right, honey. - [Radio] Strike two. - God damn it. - Where is it? - [Kelly] What's the matter with you? - Who's ahead? - The Red Sox. All right. Come on, you moron. Hit the ball! [Radio] ...gets the sign... on third... ...here's the pitch... Called strike three. God damn it to holy fucking hell! You're killing us, you stupid bastard! - [Man] Hey, shut up over there! - You shut up! [Man] This is a family neighborhood. Clean up your mouth. [Kelly] I'll clean you up! Who are, the pope? [Man] Oh, for crying out loud. I can't believe we got... God damn piece of shit! Where you trying to go with that, Kelly? This goddamn thing is too big for this goddamn house! You're gonna hurt your back. Why don't you wait until morning? I want this goddamn thing out of the house right now! I want it out! I want it out! - And whoever brought it in... - All right, I'll see what I can do. [Kelly screaming] - [radio] So enjoy... - [Kelly panting] The clean, tangy taste of Dr. Pepper. - [Dick] Nice try. - Sorry, Mrs. Bidlack Watch it. - [Police radio indistinct] - Maybe we should talk on the radio. [Baby crying] [Kelly] Indians. I can't believe the Indians... - [officer 1] Problem is they got no clean-up batter. - [Officer 2] Clean up what? Half the team's in a slump. Best move to make is get rid of that manager. You can't blame the manager, pitching, I'm telling you... - [Kelly] What a world. - [Officer 1] Yeah. There's always... - We're gonna take off now. - OK, take it easy. Hey, thanks, Tim, appreciate it. He won't give you any more trouble. Best thing to do is let him sleep it off. [Officer 2] Hey, Dick, how's the pitching arm? - Playing for a no-hitter next season? - You bet. Go get 'em, kiddo. Here you go, Mother. I made this for you. Thank you, Dad. [Sighs] I'm tired. - Pajamas are on the bed. - Thank you. [Dick] Mom? Father McCague's here. [McCague] I don't think that you need to worry. I'm sure that he's learned his lesson. This has been going on for a very long time. Every night he drinks a six pack and a pint of whiskey. By the end of the week, there's nothing left of his paycheck. It's all gone to the liquor store. Kelly has a big family to take care of. I'm sure he's carrying around the weight of the world. But, the more he drinks, the less he is able to pay the bills, which is one of the reasons he's so unhappy. But it's up to you, you see, - to make him a good home. - But I... But I do. Well, you'll have to try a little harder. [Sighs] No one says that life is easy, Evelyn. Thank you for coming by, Father. Yes, indeed. Indeed. Indeed. Are you being obedient and saying all your prayers? Yes, Father. Good boy. I'll see you in church. His breath smells like Dad's. Well, maybe that's why Father likes to use so much incense. - [Train whistling] - All right, kids. Let's go to bed. I'm tired of this day. I need a new one. [Evelyn] If I may pause in the story for a moment, I'd like to briefly explain my marriage. As an aspiring young scribe, I was a resident wit for the Sherwood Weekly Chronicle. Queen Elizabeth, they say, invented ladies stockings. Since her time, they've covered a multitude of shins. Evelyn, that's top notch. [Evelyn] I had potential, as they say. I was also in sore need of adventure. And Kelly Ryan was loads of fun. [Laughing] [Kelly] ♪ The blues of the world ♪ ♪ Just singing a song ♪ ♪ Just singing a song ♪ [Evelyn] He loved music as much as I loved words. And we were just the perfect match. - [Music playing] - [Evelyn giggling] - [siren blares] - [Evelyn] Then one night, Kelly's career as a crooner came to a terrible end. [Gurgling] And so, our life in Defiance began... ...where my husband joined the ranks of ordinary men. [Machinery clanking] So if he seems unhelpful at times, or selfish or mean, please remember that he lost his voice, while I kept mine. [Mike] Bang, bang. [Evelyn] Here you go, Dick. There's a soldier on this glass, look at that. - Who's winning the battle? - [Mike mumbles] [girls talking] Drink your milk, baby. Morning, Mother. Morning, kids. Morning, Dad. What do you say I fix everyone some pancakes? You can't. We're out of milk. I need some money, by the way. Uh, how about some coffee? You guys are old enough. - No, thanks. - No. Who the heck did this? One of you kids? You did, Daddy. No, siree. I think it was... - ...you. - No, I did not. [Chuckles] Yeah. Well, can't sell it now. Looks like we're stuck with it. Ah, it seems like we are. How about I take up hunting, fill that thing full of duck and deer? No, Daddy! You don't like that idea, OK. Well, how about I just go shoot some squirrels and little bunny rabbits? How about you don't spend so much at the liquor store. Tell you what. Every night, when I come home, I'll bring something from the grocery store. I'm gonna fill that thing to the very top, even if it takes me a year. What do you think of that? I think that's a wonderful idea. I gotta go to work so I can bring home the bacon. - And a porterhouse steak. - Hey, I'm not kidding. You just watch your old man. Kelly, I need money for the milkman. Uh... That's not enough. That's all I have. OK. [Kelly] Bye, kids. [Boy] Bye, Dad. How's Dad gonna fill the freezer when he can't pay for the milk? I have no idea, honey. But at least he has a goal. [Man on TV] Now the moment is here, when Queen for A Day is happy to make your wish come true. We're going to the famous Everson-Jennings company and order one of their sturdy, folding wheelchairs. - There's a sample. - [Applauds] - [girl] Mommy. - Yes, honey? Davey messed his diaper and I tried to change him. Oh, show me. [Baby crying] Oh, Barbie. The trick is to hold the baby's legs up while you take the diaper off. - I got it on my hands. - I know you did, sweetheart. OK, now, here we go. Follow me. All right, don't touch anything. Come on, Betsy, you too. Let's wash your hands. Yeah. Come on, come on. All right, everybody. Come on. OK, put your hands under the faucet. [Water running] - [baby cries] - [Evelyn] Oh. - [Man] Milk delivery! - Just a minute, I'll be right there. - [Baby crying] - Come on, Mrs. Ryan. I've got deliveries to make. Just a minute, please. - I'm leaving. - No, you aren't. I'm on my way. OK, girls. Stay in the kitchen until I can clean this up. You know that I got a schedule to keep. I know you do, Ray. What a life you lead. - Three dollars. - Um, I'm a little short this week. Can I owe you the rest? I... I already got three other families on credit this week. - You know I'm always good for it. - I'm not a bank, you know. - You could start charging interest. - Don't get smart with me. - Smart people know their budget. - You're right. I am. That's why I don't have a problem paying my bills. Hello, Vernon. Anything for me today? You want something in life, you got to pay for it, simple as that. - Here you go, Mrs. Ryan. - Thank you. - Hey, Ray. - Mmm. Oh, hold on, hold on. Oh! How do you like that? I won two dollars in the poetry contest for The Toledo Blade. There you go. [Baby fussing] There he goes, there he goes. Yeah. You want the money? [Barb] I'm sorry I made such a mess, Mommy. Oh. Well, actually honey, if I had gotten the door any sooner, then the milkman would have left before the mailman arrived, and we wouldn't have had any milk for our dinner tonight. So, there you go. It was all meant to be. This is what happens to one's literary efforts once they're placed in the mailbox. For the big contests, they go sailing off to New York City to be judged. The average count is a million and a half entries. A million and a half. Imagine that! Each entry is first checked to make sure it's accompanied by proof of purchase. You don't pay, you don't play. Next they go to the junior judges. College English majors, mind you. Who are instructed to eliminate the trite, the obvious and the inept. Oh, dear. And so, the final judging begins. Every syllable of every word is scrutinized and analyzed, the merits of each debated until a few of the worthiest remain. The ballots are cast, the points are added up. And the grand prize winner is declared. Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh! - [Barb] Daddy, Mommy won a shopping spree! - Oh, yeah? [Tuff] They time her as she runs in the store. [Mike] She can get whatever she wants. She's gonna get us a bunch of candy... [Barb] And fancy nuts. I'm gonna eat a cashew. - [Kelly chuckles] - Can you believe it, Dad? That's terrific, Mother. Now, I only get ten minutes and one cart, so what I did was, I walked down to the market to plot my strategy. - Wait till you hear this. - The carts are a lot smaller than the ones at the A&amp;P. - Mom talked to the butcher. - He's going to wrap up some sides of bacon and ribs. I can build up the cart that way. Ah, ah. Sounds pretty clever. I've asked him to set aside a prime rib, a chateaubriand, what do you think? - [Dick] We each get our own filet mignon. - Absolutely. Tuff, honey, would you set the table? I had filet mignon once. It ain't that great. When have you started saying "ain't"? Get off your high horse, Mother. It's a perfectly good word. - Here. - Oh, thank you. This is just perfect. I was going to put on some fish sticks, but now I can make sloppy joes. Might as well cook it up now. Looks like hamburger's not going to be good enough for this family anymore. Oh, of course it is. It just won't be the only thing we know. I've asked the kids to make me a list of what they want me to grab. - What would you like, Kelly? - Ah, don't waste any space in that cart on me. Oh, now stop. Think. What have you always wanted to try? - I don't know. - Sure you do. Shrimp cocktail. The kind they have in those little jars. I like the way they look, kind of elegant. I always wanted one of those. You shall have it. Thank you, Mother. Proud of the old lady. [Giggles] [wheels squeaking] - [man 1] I think you should... - [man 2] Oh, no, no. [Indistinct chatter] Are all these kids yours? [Boy] Hi, Mom. Yes. If it's all right, they were going to call out the time so I could stay on schedule. Oh, I don't know. Oh, heck, I don't see any problem with that. Uh... and any help you happen to give Mrs. Ryan in filling her cart, won't be seen by me. So then, Mrs. Ryan, are you... are you ready? [Kelly] Hold on. [Wheels squeaking] [gurgling] - Didn't like the way that sounded. - Thank you, Dad. All set? Go! [Family cheering] [all] Go! Faster! - I think we should split up. - OK. I'll take the frozen section, you two take the European food isle. - What do you want, hon? - Oh, caviar, expensive things. The good stuff, not the ordinary, huh? Gotcha. Marge, go! Seven minutes to go, Mom! Seven minutes! [Dick] Three minutes, Mom, three minutes! Come on! Mom, one minute left! - I got you some goose pate. You ever had that? - No. Let me know what it's like. I got all the after-dinner mints, the Swiss chocolate, these two bags of English toffees and a couple bags of coffee mints. Grab and move on, Marge, grab and move on. Where to? - Produce! - What are we looking for? Exotic things, anything grown in a foreign country. - Does Hawaii count? - [Both] Yes. [Dick] Thirty seconds, Mom! [Shouting, cheering] Time! Oh, Kelly! Kelly! I got your shrimp cocktail. I got your shrimp cocktail! [Dick] That was... great. - We're gonna eat good tonight. - Yep. [Dick] Well done, Mom. Look at all this food and candy and sugar and sweets! And lobster! [Evelyn] Let's see, what else? Anybody want an artichoke heart? - What do you think? - [Girl] This is really good. - Here, Dick, try it. - [Dick] Yeah, they're really good. What's this, Mom? Litchi nuts, they're from China. - Oh, I see. - [Dick] What do they taste like? Get the can opener and let's try one. Litchi nuts, who the hell would want to eat that? What are you looking for? I'm looking for hamburger. I have a steak all ready for you. I don't want a steak I want hamburger. Oh, look at this. Hearts of palm, from a palm tree, can you believe it? These are capers. They come from Spain. Try one. Mmm, no, thank you. Oh, come on. It's an adventure. But they're green and yicky. Please put all that food back in the freezer. I don't want everything to thaw. Capers, my ass. I think it's time we tried some caviar. Now... ...caviar is one... ...of the finest delicacies... ...in... ...the Western world. It comes from Russia. And we are about to become... ...the very first Ryans... ...to ever taste it. - [Dick] What is it? - Fish eggs. Dick, Bub, Rog, would you like to try it? - No, I'll stick with coconut. - No, thank you. - Tuff? - Um, no, thanks. [Sighs] Do you know that U.S. Army research has shown a relationship between intelligence - and a willingness to eat unfamiliar foods? - [Laughs] I just can't, Mom. Oh, well. More for me then. [Laughing] Mmm. Oh, it's marvelous. Mmm. Mmm. Oh. [Laughing] Oh, my goodness. Oh, my sweet goodness. How is your supper? Not very good. Your shrimp cocktail is in the fridge. They say it's good if you squeeze a little lemon on top. Thank you, Mother. Enjoy it, Dad. All right, what will we open next? Anybody here like lobster? [Laughing] We'll try a little of that. And... what else do we have? We have some button mushrooms... Kelly, come on over here. Sit down with us. Let's see, what else do we have? An artichoke heart, want an artichoke heart? - [Dick] Sure. - [Evelyn] Very good. Come on. You can share my seat. Sit down. Oh, yeah. Look at those little, little pickles. Look at that. Dad, you gotta try this. It's amazing. Oh, should I open the sardines? Who's gonna eat those? - [Dick] I won't. - All right, these are mine. Let's see, what else do we have here? - Can I try this? - Oh, do try it. It's just delicious. Put it on the little cracker there. - These are good. - Aren't they good? Are you sick of candy yet, honey? - No, I will never be sick of candy. - Not now. - [Kelly] It's good. - Yes, I know. [Mike] Is that one mine? [Tuff] What about these little white things? - Thanks, sweetheart. - This stuff isn't too cracked. - Mom, it's yesterday's paper. - Oh, throw that out. [Evelyn] For the next four years I would win a steady stream of prizes that would keep us functioning, but never flush. I won two ice buckets, ten pairs of galoshes, one sled, which arrived just in time, I might add, fifteen ice crushers, a case of dog food, a pair of Arthur Murray dancing shoes, a Brownie camera, one free window installation, an outboard motor, eight pogo sticks, a palm tree, which promptly died, a lifetime supply of bird seed... ...and a pony, which we had to sell to pay the electric bill. In the meantime, my eldest, Lea Anne, left home to go to nursing school. "Travel handsome, travel light. Travel always with Samsonite." And my sons, Dick and Bub, both got signed to play ball with the Detroit Tigers. How do you like that? [Sighs] So far, three of my chicks have found their wings and I am so very proud of them. That is where my prayers went. That's where they all went. [Television plays indistinct] You know why they left? We live in a hole. A hole without a ladder. I like Beech-Nut so much, I'm going to help them sponsor a contest. With the folks out there, they can win all kinds of big prizes. - Mom, do you want your notebook? - Yes, thank you, Tuff. You want to know who dug that hole? I did. Holy moley. Are you gonna eat that, Jerry? Nope, but I'm gonna sing about it. And the folks out there are gonna fill in the words. - [Music plays] - Well, all right. ♪ It's my dum-dee-dum - dee-dum ♪ ♪ Dum-dee-dum-dee-dum sandwich ♪ ♪ Dum-dee-dum-dee-dum ♪ ♪ Dum-dee-dum-dee-dum sandwich ♪ ♪ Hole in the ground ♪ ♪ Don't make a sound sandwich ♪ ♪ My stuff it in the mouth ♪ ♪ Chomp and swallow south sandwich ♪ - That's a good one, Mom. - You can have it.

You're too damn happy. [Everyone laughs] Oh, Kelly, how do you come up with these things? I don't know. They just... come to me, I guess. That was really funny. ♪ Do do-do do-do ♪ ♪ Do-do do ♪ - Hey, kids. - Hi, Daddy. - [Evelyn] You're home early. - Ah. I don't feel so hot. My head hurts. Did they pay you for the full day? I don't know. I didn't ask. I just felt so lousy I had to get out of there. - [Knock at door] - [Ray] Milk delivery! I'm glad you're here. I need four dollars for the milk man. What's he showing up so late in the day for? I don't know. What difference does it make? Well, what happened to the money I gave you? What do you think happened to it? I used it to pay the bills. - [Ray] I'm leaving. - I'll be right there. We're out of milk, would you please give me some money? I don't have any. Of course you don't. It's all in those bottles. I'm sorry. I'm going to have to owe you this week. - I'm sorry too, because I'm not going to leave the milk. - I always pay you back. That's not the point, is it? I'm not a rich man, but I never owed anyone anything. - Clearly, you're a better person than I am. - We're all in the same boat. But I am not going to do the paddling while you sit back with your hand in the water. You're absolutely right. But my children need milk. Please don't make them suffer because I am delinquent in my payments. Please. If you don't pay me next week, that's it. I'm cutting you off my route. I understand. Thank you. That was pleasant. Hey. You think money grows on trees? I work my ass off in that stinking sweatshop all day long. - You stay home and do whatever you want. - Do whatever I want? Sit around writing in your stupid notebooks. Those notebooks are the only reason this family isn't living on the street. Hey, do you want to trade places with me? [Kids screaming] Mommy! Oh, Jesus! - [Mike] What was that? - [Tuff] What happened? [Kelly] Oh, Jesus! She slipped. - Daddy was yelling at her. - What did you do to her? It was an accident! I wouldn't hurt your mother in a million years! - I think somebody should get Mrs. Bidlack. - We don't need her. Get away from the glass. Would somebody please help me up? Sweet Christ, Mother. - Would somebody help me up? - [Tuff] Betsy, stay back. [Both scream] Kelly, for goodness sakes, just move. Oh! [Grunting] Hold on, Mother. I'll take you to the hospital. Just let me get my... No, you are not! You almost killed her! I didn't do anything! I swear to God! I think it's best if you just stay put. Oh, my God! My sweet God! What...? Tuff, would you get a towel so I don't make a mess in Mrs. Bidlack's car. - [Kelly] I'll get it, Mother. - Where's my purse? Would you like me to call the police? Oh, Rita. That won't be necessary, thank you. - Here, Mom. - Honey, could you hook it over my arm? [Evelyn] Thank you. - Here, Mother. - Oh, for Pete's sake. - What am I supposed to do with that? - Here. Thank you. If you wouldn't mind mopping up so it doesn't warp the wood, I'll go over the rest of it later. Children stay put, I'm taking - your mother to the hospital. - I'm all right. - You know what the worst part of it is? - What? - A quart of milk got sucked up inside my girdle. - Oh, my dear. - [Betsy] Please don't die, Mommy. - It was an accident. [Man] Everything all right in there? The question is... This is a presidential election year. If a qualified woman were running for president, how would you feel about voting for her and why. [Woman] If the men candidates were qualified, I feel I would vote against her. My reasons being that women are very high-strung and emotional people. - They aren't knowledgeable... - [door opens] - [all kids] Mom! - [Rita] Here we go, special delivery. - Oh, we missed you so much. - Be careful of her. Oh, I'm not that fragile. Thank you for taking me. - Any time. - See, it's not so bad. Hello, Mother. How's it going? Well, I got lucky. Doctor said I was half an inch away from severing a ligament. Oh, see, kids. Your mother's as good as new. I have dinner all set, here's a cup of tea. Why don't you sit down and take a load off? Well, first thing I'd like to do is take off this wet girdle, if you could help me, I can't use my hands just yet. OK. Go on, kids, supper's on the table. - Mom, are you OK? - I'm fine, sweetheart. 'Course she's OK. It's all right, boys. Go ahead, get something to eat. I think what... ...hurt more than anything was that dig you made about my contesting. [Sighs] You know, I couldn't be prouder of you. You know that? It's just... the thing is... ...guys at the shop... Any time you win something, it's... "Oh, we know who the breadwinner is." - It ain't me. - Goodness sakes. They're just jealous. Why do you even listen to them? All I want in this world is to make you happy. I don't need you to make me happy. I just need you to leave me alone when I am. [Evelyn] Spilled milk? Don't cry. Unless, of course, it's hip high. I don't cry over milk, spilled or otherwise. I just wish I had spilled a smaller other size. Spilled milk can't be poured, if it's spreadin' 'cross the floor. But no need for tears or sorrow. There's always more to spill tomorrow.

No. At least you'd learn how to make your bed. [Sighs] Mmm.

Well, what do you know? My daughter, Mary Kay, who's also 16, won second prize. Gee, what clever kids your mother and I have. Watch it, watch it! Hey. I live in Payne, Ohio, just 85 miles away from you and I'm part of a group of contesting gals called The Affadaisies. This is probably not of much interest to a strapping, teenage boy such as yourself, but perhaps your mother would like to join us. - [Crash] - I don't care who did it, just clean it up! Well, gotta go before the house comes down. Hope we can hear from one of you soon. Sincerely, Dortha Schaefer. P.S. Since they don't publish the winning entries, I'd love to know what yours was. Here's mine, my daughter's, that is: ♪ My stack it thick and quick ♪ ♪ Snack until I'm sick sandwich ♪ ♪ Ooh-ahh ooh-ahh ♪ Dear Dortha, I love your entry. You have a true gift for inner rhyme and alliteration. I was particularly impressed by your cross-rhyming of "stack" and "snack." Here's my entry, for what it's worth: ♪ My frisk the Frigidaire ♪ ♪ Clean the cupboards bare sandwich ♪ ♪ Da-da da-da ♪ Dear Evelyn, those judges judged right. No wonder I came in second. Talk about a gift for imagery. You have it, gal. And you must come to my house for an Affadaisies meeting. We've got the crème de la crème of contesters. Gladys Tierney, she is smart as a whip and won two cars in the Stay-Puft his and hers contest. And then there's Betty Yearling and Betty White. Cooks extraordinaire. Betty Y. Is a Pillsbury bake-off winner with her famous party pork barbeque. And Betty W. Won first place in the Midwest kitchen cook-off with her double delight strawberry toll cake. And Emma Hartzler, who's won three fridges and matching stoves and a trip to Hawaii. All from her iron lung. "Kleenex is so handy, I use it every day. Cost so little, helps so much, just blow, then throw away." Now, listen, Evelyn Ryan. You are the most notable of us all and you must be at my house two weeks from now for the first Affadaisy meeting of the spring. No excuses. Now strap on those wings and fly over here. Do you remember that group of contesters I told you about? They've invited me to their meeting. - Ah. Where is it? - Over in Payne. - Payne's a long way. - It's only 85 miles. Yeah, but it still takes gas. I gotta drive to work, drive you to the grocery store, drive the garbage to the dump... How much do you think I'm left with at the end of the week? In fact, I had to enter a football pool at the gas station just to win myself some extra fuel. - You're contesting? - [Sighs] Yeah. - Why not? - You need any hints? I know how to do a pool. Well, if you win, you'd have enough gas to drive me to Payne. I can't just sit in the car while you gab with a bunch of jingle writers and forget I'm even there. My Saturdays are precious to me. Well, all right, Kelly. I won't ask again. [Door shuts] - [door shuts] - [Kelly] That was my entry. No, it wasn't. It was mine. Mom, I won 25 gallons of gas today in a football pool. - You didn't win nothing. That was my entry. - I used Barb's name. - Barb Ryan was the one that won. - That was my Barb Ryan. - I had dibs on her name first. - Says who? We made an agreement. I got Barb, Tuff and Mike. - I never said you could use my name. - Don't get smart. - Did anybody write this down? - No, it was a gentlemen's agreement. You'll have to split the gas. He didn't even know about the contest until I... What are you talking about? I was the one who told you! Split the gas, Kelly. Oh, for Christ's sake. Bruce, I hope you were telling the truth. Honest to God, Mom, Dad's just a sore loser. All right, then. I'd like to ask you a favor. I want to go somewhere. Would you drive me? Sure, Mom. I'll take you anywhere you want to go. Thank you, Bruce. Thank you. There's tuna fish for sandwiches and you'll find coleslaw in the fridge. - Kelly, what are you doing? - Just checking the radiator. Come on, Dad. We're ready to go. And if your father decides to make his chili, just make sure he doesn't burn the pot. Right. Yeah, I got it. Plenty of water, oil's fine. Watch the clutch, it's starting to slip. - I know, Pop. - Get your mother back in one piece, you hear? [Engine starts] Bye. - Bye, bye. - Bye. - Bye. - Bye, Mom. - Bye, sweetie. - Have fun, Mommy. - Thank you. - Mommy, wait. - What is it, Davey? - I got a surprise for you. You did? Show me. Oh, honey. Where did you get these? They grow all over. I got them from Mrs. Bidlack's yard, in Mrs. Zitfeld's, and Mrs. Zamone. Cripes' sakes, what did you go and do that for? Ah, Jesus. Sorry, Mother. I'm not good with that woman. Uh... - Bruce, turn off the motor. - [Bruce] Oh, brother. [Woman] Oh, my God. My sweet God. - Did you see what your boy did to my tulips? - I am so sorry. - Why would you do something like that, why? - He didn't know. He's just a little boy. Tell me what I can do to make it better. There is nothing you can do. Do you know how long I've waited for those tulips to bud? Tell me what they cost, I'll reimburse you. - $40 worth of bulbs. - Mom, are we going or not? No, honey, I'm afraid the trip is off. My gas is already in Dad's car. How am I going to get that out? Tell him to use his half now and you'll use your half later. Great. I didn't know it was bad. I thought they were beautiful. They are beautiful, Davey. They truly are. All right. Let's go make amends. Good boy. Give it gas. OK, put it in first and try again. [Engine starts, belt squeals] - [crash] - [Kelly] Oh! What are you doing? - [Tuff] Stop yelling. - I'm not yelling. You're not listening. [Dortha] Evelyn, we are all thrilled and elated to hear that daughter Tuff has learned to drive and she'll be delivering you to us, at last. We've moved our meetings to Emma's house in Goshen, Indiana, which is about 100 miles from where you are. Sorry, it's such a hike. But our gal is eager to show off her new summer outfit. Evelyn, I await your arrival... ...with bated breath. There's bologna for lunch. If I'm not back in time for dinner, heat up some fish sticks, and there's Jell-O in the fridge. - Yep. - [Tuff] Mom, we should probably get going. All right, off we go. - Watch you don't overuse the brakes. - You all ready told me, Dad. - No speeding. - Dad, this car barely goes over 40. - Don't get smart. I want your mother back here in one piece. - That's enough. Miss you already. - Bye, Mommy. - Bye, Betsy. - I love you. - [Engine starts] Bye, Davey. - Bye, Mom. - Bye, Barb. - You have fun. - Be good. Listen to your father. - Be good. - [Kids] Bye, Mommy, bye. Look out, Tuff. Look out. Bye. Well, what do you want to do now, kids? Hmm. Defiance, a nice place to leave. [Both laughing] Honey, you can drive a little faster now. Oh, my goodness. We've crossed the state line. - Doesn't look any different. - [Laughs] The grass is much greener on this side, Tuff. It is much greener. [Chuckles] Oh, boy. You can relax, honey. You're doing just fine. Gonna be hot today. The girls will have to wipe me off the floor when we get there. Yeah, I'm starting to broil. Doesn't feel that hot outside. - Do we have the heater on? - No. Let me put the fan on. - [Whirring] - Ugh, that's even worse. Turn it off. [Whirring continues] Mom, I think the car's overheated. - [Evelyn] Holy Scott. - Maybe we should pull over. There should be a town in a few miles. I'm sure there's a gas station there. I don't think we're supposed to keep driving when the engine's hot. I-I-I say we keep going. Car's gonna be just fine. [Clunking] [car sputtering] - [Evelyn] Hello? - Ma'am. - Overheated, huh? - Yes. Fan belt's gone. When's the last time you had it replaced? Oh, I don't know. It's my husband's car. How long will it take to fix? Take at least an hour for the radiator to cool down enough for me to open it up. After that, who knows. Depends on what the damage is. You might as well make yourself at home. Alrighty. Well, come on, Tuff. I'll buy you a pop. I'll bet Dad knew that fan belt was rotten and didn't replace it on purpose. Oh, honey, your father's careless but he's not mean. I'm sure he just didn't bother to check. Do you ever wish you'd never married him? My gosh, Tuff. Do you? - No, I don't have any regrets. - Come on, Mom. You've been stuck in a house for 20 years cooking and cleaning and taking care of a bunch of crappy kids. - Don't use that. Especially in regards to yourself. - Sorry. But you could be living in a city, writing for a newspaper, having an interesting life. I do have an interesting life. Your life stinks. Gosh, Mom, just look at today. You finally get a chance to go somewhere and the lousy car breaks down. - [Laughs] - It's not fair. If I were you, I'd be angry all the time. Well, that wouldn't do me any good now, would it? For gosh sakes, Mom, you're only human. Oh, sweetheart. [Sighs] Maybe I'm meant to make it to the Affadaisies, and maybe I'm not. But right now, I'm sitting here in the shade having a conversation with my wonderfully feisty daughter, and I intend to enjoy this moment to the fullest. And I suggest, for your own well-being, that you do the same, hmm? [Ladies screaming] Dortha Schaefer, is that really you? Oh, honey, get into these arms. Virginia, there is an Evelyn Ryan! Oh, look at you. I can't believe it, hello! Welcome, for housework escaping! Oh, God, it's so good to see you. Thank you so much for delivering your mother to us. - No problem. - You have no idea what this means to us. Now, you come in, too. That was a big, long drive for you. - [Tuff] Sure was. - [Dortha] New driver. Congratulations. Emma! Look who we found outside on the curb. We got a stray bird back in the nest, girls. Evelyn Ryan, as I live... and breathe. Emma Hartzler, you are a vision. She looks like a giant corn on the cob, doesn't she? - [Laughter] - [Evelyn] I finally found my soul mates with the Affadaisies. They were the sharpest group of gals I'd ever met. We mostly talked shop, and critiqued each other's work. - Evelyn, you get on over here. - Here I come. - It's clever, but with Pillsbury, rhyme doesn't pay. - Only if it's in verse. But inner rhyme is still valid, don't you think? Ooh... ooh. If you spell Pillsbury flour like the bud, and not the baking kind, then you've got a homophone and don't... need the rhyme. Oh, love it! - What's super potato salad? - Pickle juice. Brilliant. What's the consensus on hyphenated words for 25 words or less? Technically, it is one word. Don't trust judges to know that. They count a contraction as two words. Oh, I'm in trouble. I'll have to knock off a couple of articles. Why waste space on an article, when you can put in something zesty. "After all," "the" and "antidisestablishmentarianism" are both one word, but which one packs the bigger punch? - [Laughs] - What? Anti-what? Did anyone else just hear that word come out of her mouth? This is why she wins the big prizes. Can you sing that? Let's just hear what it sounds like. [Evelyn] We debated whether our days as contesters were coming to an end. [Gladys] Did you see this? No skill involved? No skill involved! This is the death of literacy, ladies. [Betty] I don't want to hear that. It'll never happen. [Ladies chattering] This is the last of the big contests. Everybody snapped these up. I got you the last one. - Oh, Dortha, you keep it. - Mmm-mm. Honey, you've got more kids at home, now you take that. OK? [Tuff] So, what do you have to do for this one, Mom? Oh, it's a one-liner. They want you to finish a limerick. "The time of your life you can win with Dr. Pepper the flavor that's in. It's distinctive and bright, it's lively and light... There's no time like now to begin." - Eh... - Oh, leave me alone. I'm just warming up. - Evening, Rita, Nancy. - Oh, it was a hot one today. There was a wonderful breeze over in Goshen. Well, it was a hot one here today. [Woman] Five minutes to supper, sweetheart. Oh, for Pete's sake. Who locked the door? - Hey, you guys, let us in. - Honey, let's go around the back. ♪ Row row row your boat ♪ ♪ Gently down the stream ♪ ♪ Throw your dad overboard and listen to him scream ♪ - Mom's home! - Hey. What are you kids doing outside? Well, we went to the movies this afternoon. When we got back, Dad locked us out of the house. He what? Kelly! Kelly! Open the door! - [Bangs on door] - Open the door. - Where the hell have you been? - I told you, I might be late. - Not this late. - You locked your kids out of the house? Good grief, Kelly! Tuff set the table, please. You left at the crack of dawn. You don't come back until it's almost dark. What the hell were you doing all this time? I was gone for ten hours. If you can't take care of your kids for less than half a day, then you might as well leave this house. You can goddamn be the one to leave. Get off of my mother! [Everyone screaming] [groaning] [Evelyn] "For picnic or party, Jell-O's a boon. Made by nine, all set by noon. The taste and shimmer-shake appeal, Jell-O jollies any meal." [Snickering] Christ, Mother. You've killed me. Death by Jell-O is highly unlikely. And I want you to know, I am not cleaning up this mess. Tuff, could you get me some towels? Not on your life. She's not cleaning up after you. Now kids, go ahead and watch TV while I make dinner. - [Kids laughing] - Go on. By the way, the fan belt fell off the car and that is why we are so late. Yeah, I was waiting for that to happen. What's this? Steak. I went shopping today. I wanted to make a nice dinner for the kids. Why didn't you feed them? I was crying and didn't want them to see me. Why on Earth were you crying? I thought you decided to go away and never come back. [Sighs] For goodness sakes. You know I'd never leave the kids with you. I got you something too. It was supposed to be a surprise. It's in there. Here you go, Mother. I found it at a secondhand store. I paid a guy at the shop to fix it up. Oh, well, it is the most beautiful thing I have ever seen. I thought it was about time you had a proper desk. How did you pay for it? Oh, don't you worry about that. Thank you, Kelly. I... I love you. [Breathes deeply] [ringing] - Hello? - [Man] Hello, Mrs. Ryan? It's Cutter Murphy, down here at Defiance Home Saving and Loan. Just, um, a friendly reminder to, uh, let you know that the second mortgage is coming due on your house. Mr. Murphy, we've never taken out a second mortgage. Oh, uh, yes you did. Yes, uh, Mr. Ryan came down here three years ago and signed the papers. How much do we owe? Um... $4,000 due in, um... due in 30 days. See ya, fellas. Hello, Mother. What are you doing out here? When were you gonna tell me about the second mortgage? It's due, huh? I had a feeling that day might be coming up. Is there anything left? I was gonna pay it back without anyone ever knowing about it. Is there anything left, Kelly? No... no, no. It's all... gone. They're gonna repossess the house. Do the kids know? I told them as soon as I got the call. I didn't want them to hear it from anybody else. Are they angry with me? Right now, they're just scared. Guess we could always rent another place. At least we wouldn't have to worry about repairs anymore. This is my house, Kelly. My house. I just... ...felt like a drowning man. Never being able to catch up... I just wanted, for once, to have a few extra dollars in my pocket. Well, that's water under the bridge now, isn't it? Where you going? I have to make dinner. Do you hate me, Mother? I'm still in shock. I'll have to let you know. We need to talk about what will happen if we need to leave this house. We may not be able to stay together. What do you mean? Aunt Lucy said she could take Betsy and Dave. You kids like the farm, don't ya? No, we don't. Aw, what about that old horse of theirs? You love that horse. I really don't. - Where am I gonna go? - Mrs. Bidlack has an extra room. There is no way in heck I am staying with her. You'll be right next door. It'll be like living here. No it won't. There'll be another family here. There will be someone sleeping in my room! - How's that steak, kids? - Don't be rude, answer your father. [Sniffling] It's good, Daddy. Well, last one, eat up. [Muffled voices] [voices stop] What are you kids doing? We're praying that you win something very big. [Sighs] All right. Don't let me disturb you. [All praying] [Ray] Times are hard again, huh? Yes. Yes, they are. I'll tell you what. Um... I'll leave you the milk, you don't have to pay me until next week. Thank you, Ray. - Thank you, so much. - [Phone rings] I got a bag of laundry in the truck, it's just a couple of shirts, you know, if you do a good job, I could even recommend you to my customers. - [Phone ringing] - I don't take in laundry. Could somebody please get that? Hey, I'm just trying to do you a favor, OK? - Don't get uppity. - I have enough for two bottles of milk, and that will have to suffice. [Whispers] Mommy, it's the detective from Toledo. A detective? That's it. There's nothing more I can do for you. Barb, count out the money for the milkman, please. More. Hello? - [Man] Mrs. Evelyn Ryan? - Yes, this is she. I'm interviewing finalists for the Dr. Pepper "Time of Your Life" contest, - Yes, of course. - Will you be in this afternoon? [Stammers] Yes, certainly. - 3:00? - Oh, that'll be fine. - We'll be here all day. Do you have our address? - Yes, I do. That's my job. All right. We'll see you then. - I look forward to it. - Thank you. - What? What is it? - Kelly! - What's going on? - Get out here! - It's way too soon to be excited, - [toilet flushes] - but I am a possible winner... - What is it, Mother? Kelly, a detective is on his way to Defiance right now. I'm in the running for the "Time of Your Life" contest. - Is this a big one? - It's very big. We need to clean this place up. Betsy, Davey, pick up your toys. Tuff, get all that stuff off the table. Mike... Dad give Mike some money, send him to the store for some Dr. Pepper. - What for? - We need to show the detective we're using the product. This is my last dollar. What if we don't win? - That's a problem for another day. - Go, Mike. - Get it from the refrigerator, we want to serve it cold. - OK, Mom. Tuff? Take all this stuff and put it on the back porch. Barbie, stop crying, honey, and get me a broom for goodness sake. [Gasping] [man] Are you employed outside the home? Oh, goodness, no. I have enough to do here. And your husband, what does he do? He's a machinist. Do you own or... rent your home? We own it. One car or a two car family? One car. A Chevy. - The one parked out front? - Yes. You need to put some more air into those tires. Oh? Oh! OK, final question. If you were stuck on a desert island and you only had one beverage to drink... ...what would the beverage be? Orange juice. Orange juice? To prevent scurvy. But my beverage of choice is Dr. Pepper, of course. [Laughs] - Thanks for the honesty. - A pleasure, Det. Feeney. That's it. When the final decision's made, you'll be notified immediately. - And when might that be? - Oh, two weeks to a month. Oh, I see. - Thank you for coming by. - The pleasure's all mine. - [Sighs] - [giggles] Orange juice. What kind of crazy answer was that? I think your mother did a heck of a job, what do you think, kids? What if we win and it's too late? What's with the doom and gloom? We're halfway there. Mom, will me and Davey still have to go to the farm? We don't know yet, honey. It's something we have to prepare for. Don't listen to Mom. She's just being modest. None of those other entries are as good as hers. She's a shoo-in. I'm not a shoo-in. There could be 20 other people up for this prize. Don't worry, kids. Everything is going to be OK. No, it isn't. Even if we do win, so what? We'll be just as poor as we were before because of all the money you stole from us. I didn't steal anything! I made an error in judgment. Heck of an error. You all think this isn't tearing me apart? I did it to pay the bills. I wanted you kids to eat steak. I wanted your mother to have one decent piece of furniture, that didn't look like it came from a thrift store. I don't care! - I want our house back! - It isn't gone yet! So, have a little faith, for Christ's sake. OK, Tuff, now you've upset your mother. You OK, Mother? If you don't win this one, there'll always be another... No, there won't. In another year, there won't be any of these contests left. If we lose this house, that's it. I can't buy another house with a three-dollar poetry prize, now can I? - You'll think of something. - No. You think of something! It's your turn, your turn to make things right because I'm out of ideas. - Please don't fall apart. - For God's sakes, Kelly, I'm not a saint. If you can't stand to see me upset, then go away. Let me do it in peace. All right. [Shuts door] [sobs] Thanks. Mom, there are bugs in the soup. - I have them too. - Me too. Those aren't bugs. They're spices. - They have legs. - Don't be silly. Spices don't have legs. There are no bugs in the soup. Listen to your mother, kids. [Telephone rings] - Hello? - [Man] Hello. Mrs. Kelly Ryan? - Yes, yes, this is she. - Congratulations. You have won a free offer from Bright Way Rug and Upholstery Cleaners. We will give you our special living room discount. Plus, we will clean one area rug, absolutely free. - [Barb crying] - Hello, ma'am? We're not interested, thank you. It's all right. Shh, shh, shh. It's all right. It's all right. Shh. Mommy, what do we do with this? Just put it all on the front porch. Thank you, girls. Hey, Davey, go outside with that. [Telephone rings] - Hello? - [Man] Hello. - Is this Mrs. Evelyn L. Ryan? - This is she. Mrs. Ryan, it's my pleasure to inform you that you are our first-prize winner in the Dr. Pepper "Time of Your Life" contest. Oh, my word. You've won a trip for two to Switzerland, a Ford Mustang, his and hers Longines watches and cash in the amount of $3,440,64. Goodness, well... ...these prizes couldn't come at a better time for my large family. - Kids! - [Laughing] I'm glad to hear that, Mrs. Ryan. - Come down here. - You have every reason to be proud. Your entry beat out 250,000 others. Thank you for telling me that. You've brightened my day considerably. Thank you, Mrs. Ryan. Good day. - We won! - [Everyone screams] Mom, can we go tell the neighbors? You can tell whoever you want! Tuffy, it's OK. Everything's going to be OK. We're all going to be OK. No, we aren't. - For cripe's sake. - You go on outside, I'll take care of her. Come on, let's go tell everybody. Come on. [Giggling] [Bruce] We won! We won the big contest! He's never going to change. You're absolutely right. He's not. [Sighs] Do you know what that man said to me on the phone just now? No. He said that I beat 250,000 other entries. And do you know what else? It wasn't even my best one. Honey... Honey, you have your whole life in front of you, and you can make of it whatever you want. You have a marvelous mind. And a beautiful heart. And you can accomplish anything. Everything is possible. Do you know that? [Sighs, sniffles] Forgive him, Tuff. Forgive him so you can embrace this... ...truly remarkable day. I love you, Mom. I love you. ♪ Bye-bye blue ♪ ♪ Bye-bye blue ♪ ♪ Bells ring ♪ ♪ Birds sing ♪ ♪ Sun is shining ♪ ♪ No more pining ♪ [Evelyn] I never made it to Switzerland. Naturally, I cashed in the trip to pay off the mortgage. However, I did get my chance to travel... to Dallas, Texas where Dr. Pepper made me their own queen for a day. - Oh. - However, I was deeply annoyed by the hat, as my hair was flattened for the rest of the day. It was the first time I ate a meal I didn't have to cook, on a plate that I didn't have to wash. Or soaked in a tub that I didn't have to scrub. Or slept in a bed, that I didn't have to make. I never won another major contest after that. Nor did I ever travel much beyond the Ohio-Indiana state line. [Kids laughing] Drive safely. But I'm happy to report, every one of my children got the chance to see the world beyond. I saw them off to California, Colorado, Virginia, Texas, Florida, New York. I've watched them graduate college, play ball, practice nursing, practice law. Bye, Mom. - And yes, some of them have even written books. - [Kelly] Goodbye! My husband, Kelly, bless his soul, found his peace, at last. He left a legacy of atonement that, frankly, took my breath away. He deposited his pension checks in a secret account, that he had opened just for me. I never had to worry about earning another nickel again. - Does anyone want these? - You can have it. [Evelyn] When it was my time to take leave of this world, all my chicks were there to see me off. It was a lovely day, indeed. Tuff, you want to take Mom's typewriter? Yeah. Oh, my goodness.
