[MUSIC PLAYING] [HOWLING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [WHISTLE BLOWS] [WHISTLE BLOWS] Hey. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] [WHISTLE BLOWS] [CHATTER] [HOWLING] [MUSIC PLAYING] Hello? Hello? Um, I was wondering if-- oh, I'm sorry. Do you speak English? Yes. Yes, well, I'm looking for my Uncle, Peter Kranek. He was supposed to meet me here. Um, he lives right over-- I know him. Yes, well, he was supposed to come-- We all know him. Well, I was wondering if I could call him, if you have a telephone. No. No? Um, isn't that a phone right there? Oh, yes, we have a telephone. He does not. Well, can I call for a cab? WORKER: No. No, I can't call for a cab? No, there's no cab to call. Well, can I at least walk there from here? Yes. Will you show me? Yes. Go down this road. Take the left fork. Walk for about five miles. You'll see a hill. On the hill, a big house-- that is his. Thank you. No, there's another way. Yes? Across the platform, the next train will come in about an hour. Take it and go back to wherever you came from. What? Thanks a lot, for nothing. [MUSIC PLAYING] [CHATTER] I don't know. Who's this going to be? [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] Go somewhere and do something about it, man. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] Hey, [NON-ENGLISH]. Don't be afraid. We won't hurt you. I'm not afraid of you. Then why do you stand so far away? [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] OLD WOMAN: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] You know about him? If this is Peter Kranek's house, he's my uncle. Why? Would you give him this from us? Why don't you just give it to him yourself? I don't think he will take it from us, because we are Gypsies. Nobody likes us. Why don't you come over here and give it to me yourself if you want me to do you a favor? Or are you afraid? Afraid of you? No, not of you. [MUSIC PLAYING] [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Why can't you people leave me in peace? [GASPS] Eleanor? What the hell are you doing here? I wrote your father not to send you. I-- I'm sorry. The letter must have gotten lost in the mail. Um, speaking of mail, someone gave me this to give to you. What is it? ELEANOR CRANE: I don't know. Who gave it to you? There's this boy and this old woman down the hill in this car. Gypsies. I'm sorry. I know I told your parents you could stay here while they were at the conference, but it's not possible. You will have to go back to them. Why? I told you. It's-- No, why isn't it possible? There are reasons. Well, what are they? Look, Uncle Peter, normally I would be more polite. But around here, nobody feels like they need to be polite to me. So I figure, why bother? You talk like your father, sarcastic. It's not good for a girl. Yeah, well, if I asked in a more girlish way, would you answer me? PETER KRANEK: It's not safe. There have been murders here recently, terrible murders. Uncle Peter, I grew up in New York City. It's different. I-- I don't want you here. I cannot be responsible for you. I am not asking you to be responsible for me. Yes, but my brother is asking me to be responsible for you. And I cannot. So you must go back to him. Come. We're going to the town. We'll call your father from there. You will leave today. Nice of you to have me. If I did not care about you, I would not care if you stayed. Well, let's just hope you care enough to carry my bags. I had to lug them all the way out here. Don't worry. I have no telephone. But I do have an automobile. Yes, I understand. Yes, they are on the conference floor. But I'm in a train station with their daughter. Should I just leave her here? No, I cannot call back this evening. That is too late. You must-- [SIGHS]. She must leave. Yes, I understand. You are a functionary, and you are incapable of making any decision at all. Goodbye. Your parents are on the conference floor. They cannot be disturbed by private calls. So you see this diplomatic business, it's very important, more important than family. - I guess. - It doesn't matter. You will go back this afternoon. WORKER: No. What? No more trains till tomorrow noon. Then we will find a place for you to stay in town. Why in town? Yes, Mr. Kranek. Why in town? Surely you have enough room for us since you dismissed all your servants. I'm not-- I-- Besides, sir, you know that the inn has been closed since poor Soren was killed. Look, if I'm going to be a burden, I can just stay here at the station. BOTH: No. You can come home with me, girl. You'll be safe. No, there is no reason why she should not stay at the mansion, no reason. Well then, perhaps you should be going. It's getting late. The sun will soon be down, and the full moon-- That's enough. I know what you think. I know what you all think. And what is that, Mr. Kranek? Come along. Tomorrow you'll go. Listen to me very carefully. You must not attempt to leave this room tonight no matter what you may hear. And you may hear nothing. But no matter what happens, you must not leave this room. What is going on? I wish to God I knew. Please, please, stay in this room. [CLATTER] Uncle Peter, what are you doing? You can't lock me in here. PETER KRANEK: I'm sorry. It's for your own protection. Uncle Peter, get back here. What if there's a fire? [MUSIC PLAYING] [CLOCK CHIMES] A nice well-balanced supper. [MOANS] [WAILING] - Uncle Peter? - [GROWLS] [WAILING] [MOANS] "No steel shall stay. No door shall bar when the full moon shows the mark of the star. No prayers save. No curses reprieve a cursed death and men to grieve. To silver only since the world began can slay the wolf that walks like a man." [ROARING] [CHATTER] [SHOUTS IN DISTANCE] Take it in. [INAUDIBLE] wolf? [INAUDIBLE]? Get him, boy. Get him. [INAUDIBLE] [SHOUTING] [DOG BARKING] [INAUDIBLE] [DOG BARKING] [SNARLING] Ah! [MUSIC PLAYING] [ROARING] [MUFFLED SCREAMS] [CRIES] [GUN SHOT] [GUN SHOT] [GUN SHOT] - That way. [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUFFLED SHOUTING] [DOOR CLATTERS] [DOOR SLAM] [FOOTSTEPS IN DISTANCE] [GROANS] Oh, my god. Oh, my god, Uncle Peter. Oh, my god. Are you OK? What happened to you? Peter, what happened? I don't know. I can't remember. Oh, god, I don't believe in Vukodlak superstitions. I'm raised not to believe. But now I believe. God help me, I believe. What are you talking about? Three months ago, I was sitting at that desk. The window was open. [MUSIC PLAYING] [GROWLING] I made myself believe that it hadn't been a wolf, that I hadn't seen what I saw. What was it? Vukodlak, the wolf that walks like a man. A werewolf. You're telling me you were attacked by a werewolf. The next night, the next night when the full moon rose, I-- I blacked out. The next morning, my servants told me that I had vanished from my rooms, gone out the window from the second story and come back in the same way. But I didn't remember. Then they found the first body, Anna Skornik, torn as if by a wild animal. I didn't want to. Believe me. My mind did not want to know, but my heart knew. That is why I dismissed the servants. Though I tell myself it's because I did not want them harmed, but that is a lie. I dismissed them so that they would not see, so that they would not see what happened during the hours of the full moon, the hours that I can not remember. When I hunt in the night, when I kill in the night-- A handy confession, Mr. Kranek. Ah. So you no longer call me by my first name. Or should I say, Inspector Krol. I have made a terrible mistake, Mr. Kranek. I refused to believe that a man like you could be a murderer. But now we follow a trail of blood to your door and hear your own confession. It's not his fault. He can't help what happened to him. Place Mr. Kranek under arrest. Wait. I strongly advise that you offer no resistance. Wait, you don't understand. The moon is full again tonight. You think that bullets will stop me? Oh, yes, Mr. Kranek, most assuredly so. They tell stories of wolves who walk, who are immune to bullets. But we know differently, don't we? The only monsters I have ever met, Mr. Kranek, are human monsters. And you are one. Bars will hold you. Bullets will kill you. And a rope will hang you. Take him away. You are very fortunate to be alive, young lady. I saw bullet holes in his chest. I saw them close up. I saw them disappear, just like-- Just like on television, perhaps. Come along. We will discuss this further in town. Am I under arrest? Well, if you insist. I prefer to think that you are aiding us in our investigation. Come. OK, drop it. Sorry, I left them waiting. [INAUDIBLE] Listen to me. You have to understand. You will all die. - You first. No, listen to me. You'll all die. Listen to me. [MUSIC PLAYING] You didn't find any wounds on him, did you? No, only the scar on his shoulder. But you didn't find any blood on him. No, but he could have cleaned it off after he reached home. But he didn't. Look, I was there. I-- I saw the bullet holes, and I-- I saw-- - Yes, I know. The, uh, bullet holes closed up. Please forgive me for saying this, Ms. Crane, but, uh, to my mind, it is much more likely that young girls lie than that men turn into wolves. You helped him clean off the blood, didn't you? No. And I'm not lying to you. Well, I talked to your father in Geneva. And you will return to him by tomorrow's train. What's going to happen to Peter? That is for the court to decide, perhaps the madhouse, perhaps death by hanging. I'm sorry, Ms. Crane. I know this must be very upsetting to you, but, uh, I don't think you would want me to lie to you. Listen, Mister-- Inspector. Inspector, tonight when the full moon rises, my uncle's going to change. Look, he's going to become-- Ah, that is something I would like very much to see. Am I free to go? Yes, of course. My constable can drive to your uncle's residence. I'll walk. As you wish. The region is quite safe. You will not be troubled, now. Aren't you a bit young to be driving? My grandmother wants to see you. Get in. Is that an order? How can I give you an order? You're not my sister. Get in. You like it? Good, huh? Yes, and thank you. You're welcome. See? I'm polite. Now come. My grandmother wants to see you. Isn't she here? No, close. She wants to talk privately. Let's go. Come on. Where are we going? We're really close. It's close. Here. [MUSIC PLAYING] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] You know what he is, about the curse of the wolf. He took it from my grandmother's brother. He had it for a long time. Most time, when the full is full, they keep him chained, give him animals to kill. Sometimes he'd get loose, kill men. You understand? So he's the one who attacked my uncle. Yes, your uncle stabbed him with a silver blade, killed him. He is buried here. Now, your uncle, he can't lose the curse. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] She says nothing kills [INAUDIBLE].. And [INAUDIBLE] can not kill himself. You understand? [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] Only silver kills the wolf man. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] You ever shot? No. CARL: You know how? Pull back hammer till it clicks like this. Then shoot. - Wait. Hold on. Wait a second. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] These are silver. We made them from the blade that killed my uncle, only enough for three. Are you trying to tell me she wants me to kill my uncle? Take it. No, I don't want it. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] Take for your uncle. [INAUDIBLE] his death. Take. But he is your uncle, of course. Come. Take me back to the village. Where in the village? - The police station. - OK. I'll take you. - I have to see him now. - Please. I want to see my uncle. Why? Does it matter why? Sometimes. You have told me that you are not very close to your uncle, that you have not seen him since you were a baby. You have only seen him for a few minutes since you came here. And even during that time, he tried to get you to go back to Geneva and locked you in a bedroom without food. So I wonder, what will you tell him? What will you ask him? Look, Inspector, I don't want to argue with you. Can I see him or not? Come along. So you've come to visit me after all. Or is it to be interrogation? You need all these men to guard my uncle. It is a reasonable precaution. It's an absurdity, and he knows it. Inspector, I'd like to see him alone. That is quite impossible. What do you think I'll do to her, huh? What are you afraid of? [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] I do not think he can harm you, Ms. Crane. But if you take my advice, you won't get too close to the bars. - Thank you for coming. - Uh, Peter, look-- Please, I need you to take a message to your father. For a long time, as boys, as young men, we were close. And then for a long time, we were not close, just because I was jealous of your father. I know this now. Because he was successful? No, because your father saw his future, saw his destiny and-- and pursued it and achieved it. And I could not. I never saw my destiny. Now it is too late for anything. Please tell him that I'm sorry. - I will. Look, Peter, is there any-- anything I can do for you? What needs to be done I'm afraid you cannot do. I'm sorry. I am so sorry. What? I can't do it. I can't do this. I can't do it. Eleanor? Ms. Crane? [CRYING] CARL: Hey. I didn't hear any shots. I don't see any policemen running. Don't feel bad. We couldn't do it either. Come on. I'll take you to your uncle's house. [MUSIC PLAYING] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] Please, I can't stop it. Run. Run. Run, run, run, run, run, run. [GROANING] [SNARLS] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] [ROARS] [INAUDIBLE] I shot him. [ROARING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [ANIMAL SCREAMS IN DISTANCE] [HOWLS] [MUSIC PLAYING] Oh, no. Oh. [SCREAMS] [GROWLS] Please. It's me. It's Eleanor. Please don't make me shoot you, please. Please, Uncle Peter, these are silver bullets. Please don't make me kill you. It's me. Yeah, it's Eleanor. Yes, it's me. It's me. Please, Uncle Peter, it's me. Please remember. It's me. Please, it's me, Eleanor. Remember? It's me. [ROARS] Oh, ah. [SOBS] Oh, my god. I'm sorry. I am so sorry. [SOBS] Oh, my god. Oh. Uncle Peter? This was my destiny, to be a thing of wonder and terror and then to die. Do not cry. Do not be sad for me. I talked to your mother. You will be met in Geneva. [SIGHS] The train should be here any minute. Ms. Crane, I, uh, I told your mother only that Mr. Kranek has died in a shooting accident. You may tell her whatever you wish. But you must understand there could have been no official report on this. There is no proof. And even a very foolish, pig-headed inspector is thinking of his job. Ms. Crane, your uncle was-- What about my uncle? He was a very kind and charming man in a world that is sorely lacking in such qualities. He was one of my closest friends. One of my deepest regrets is not believing him. I have my other duties to attend. I bid you good bye. Inspector. Thank you. I'm-- I'm sure my uncle understood. He was a very smart man, my uncle. Indeed he was. Good bye. CARL: Hey, [NON-ENGLISH]. My name's Eleanor. OK, Eleanor, she wants to see you. You kill him with a silver bullet. You did good. But I didn't want to. He forced me to. He wanted to die. Yes. I understand. I understand. CARL: Good luck, Eleanor. - Good luck. Thank you. You're welcome. [SIGHS] [MUSIC PLAYING]
