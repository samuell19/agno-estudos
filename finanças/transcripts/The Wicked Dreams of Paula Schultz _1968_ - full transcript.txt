[instrumental music] [fanfare] [the narrator] These gates look into East Berlin. Beyond the gates is a very ugly wall. Beyond the wall, there area lot of people who like to run. Some run to keep from getting shot, others just like to run. Of these, the best is Paula Schultz. [gunshot] [upbeat music] [cheering] [applause] [applause] [applause] [cheering] [cheering] -And therefore, comrade Schultz, it honors me to bestow this final honor upon you, for being chosen East Germany's athlete of the year. [applause] Your government is confident that you will bring to your state further, greater glory in the next Olympic games. -Thank you, thank you all very much. I'm greatly honored, not only for myself, but also for all the other members of our athletic theme. -Ah, spoken like the brave little patriot that you are. -And also for all the women of the Deutche Demokratische Republik. I will doeverything in my power to fight for furthertrue freedom for our female citizens. [tapping] -Schultz! You're not supposed to talk. -But comrade Klaus, I just wanted all the women to know... -Ja, ja, ja, ja. Thank you, Paula Schultz. Athlete of the year. [applause] [Paula] Comrade Klaus! [the narrator] Over here in West Berlin is also a group that runs. They will run anything from a needle to a pink elephant, as long as it runs up a profit. And outruns a bullet. The smoothest of these runners is Bill Mason. -No tricks, Billy boy! -Oh come on, Lars,sweetheart, would I lie to you? Would I double-crossyou guys, after all the business we've done together? -Uh-huh. -When we deliversuch expensive items, we like to get paid. -I'll have your 75 000 after I pick it up from Schlasser, in less than an hour! -You're giving me the truth,Billy boy? There is no chanceof a slip-up with your East German contact,eh? -Believe me boys,Schlasser's in the bag. [the narrator] To get into East Berlin, it's not always necessary to go over the wall, through it, or under it. You just might have something the fellow wants. And if he wants it bad enough, you get what you want. [whistle] [women] Eins, zwei, drei, vier, eins, zwei, drei, vier. -What's this all about? -Training for Olympics. All day, all night, train, train. Good, good! -That blonde wouldstop traffic anywhere. -That's Paula Schultz! She's champion! -She's sure built like one.

[chatter] [instrumental music] Hello. Comrade Klabfus was expecting me. This way? Thank you. [Klabfus] The main thing is that comrade Schultz should look like this. So we put her on the tractor, here. -Ja. [knocking] -Good afternoon, director Klabfus. Comrade Mittelhaufer. -Ja. -Well? What do you think? [Klabfus] What we think? -They ordered me to look my best. Much better than that, don't you think? And so much more freedom! -I cannot believe my eyes. -Well neither couldall the other girls on my team. And now they allwant one too! -They do? Out of that filthy costume! And into these overalls, and quick! -Oh! Now you go and tell your minister Klaus to go an pick another symbol, Schnell! Director flabface! -I'll show you!

Did you see what she wantsthe symbol of East German womanhood to wear? This! -And you see what she wants to wear? Another inch and nothing! -Another inchand everything! -Oh, she wants to paint her face and her lips like a capitalistic tart! -Comrade Schultz, East Germany's ideal woman is a worker! No frills, no... -But this is not an ideal woman. This is an ideal cow! Why, I used to dress better when I was still in the farm feeding the pigs! -You hate tractors so much? I'll send youwhere we make them! -Now, this is a very serious situation. I shall handle this crisis personally. Everybody, Raus, Raus, Raus! Raus,let's go! [door closing] Mittelhaufer! -Hello. - Raus! -Paula Schultz, have youlost your senses? -Oh, shoot me and get it over with. -Now Paula, sometimes...-Minister Klaus, you can say anything you want, and nothing will change my mind. -Even if I tell youthat I agree with you? -You...-Shh! [instrumental music] Aha! -What are you doing? -Listening devices! Paula, I agree with you. But first, I've got to think of something fast to counteract your transfer to the tractor factory. -I'm sure you'll thinkof something that will save me. We have so muchin common, you know. -Oh, yes, we do! We both have the same bold, wild, imaginative hearts! The same lovely, extravagant, wicked dreams! We're not like those peasants we're surrounded by. [knocking] -Schultz, document of deportation to hard labor in the tractor factory. All it needs is your signature. -You are forgetting one thing, aren't you, assistant minister Klabfus? I give the orders around here. And I put Schultz into a position where she can do the most good. Come, comrade. [instrumental music] -Oh! -Over here, comrade. -Oh! This is beautiful! Oh, look! [bells chiming] Oh, I feel like I'm dreaming. Somebody ought to pinch me. -It could happen, it could happen! I trust you will find your new post satisfactory. -Oh, yes! And thank you so much! And thank you again! -Raus, Raus, Raus! -Ja! -Auf wiedersehen. -Auf wiedersehen. Thank you! Oh! [giggling] Comrade minister. -Just call me your dream prince reporting for duty. -How did you get in here? -Oh, I've arranged for us to have a joining suite. After all, we'll be working very closely together. -We will? -Didn't you petition... for improved living conditions? -Oh, well, you know,yes, but... All this splendorand luxury for a littlepersonal aide, I mean... -Oh, my beautiful Schultz. This will be our perfect paradise. When I see you in these it will be my dream come true. Quickly, I can't wait! -Comrade Klaus!-Oh, please! -Comrade Klaus, please,what's gotten into you? Comrade Klaus,you wouldn't want me to wear those in the middleof the day! -Ah, that's an order, Schultz! Over beautifully delicious champagne. Here, let me help you, here. -No, comrade Klaus... I mean, dream prince. I'd rather it bea complete surprise. -Yes, so would I, yes. -Now go. [kissing noises] [kissing noises] -I hear a pipper! Music to my ears. Was that your little skirt, my princess? [Paula] Yes, that was my little skirt. -That was her little skirt. -What's coming off now? Your little blouse? -No, no, no! I want to save the best for last! -The best for the last! The best for the last, the best for the last! -Klaus, dear, I'm ready, dear! -Wait! I must prepare myself. Or I'll be blinded by the first sight of your total beauty. [instrumental music] Oh, love of my life, I... Ah, ah, ah, ah! Your shyness is most appealing. -Now, Klaus, you wouldn't wantto wear yourself out... -Shy girls love to be chased before they're caught! -Klaus! Get off me! Let me go! Now don't you dare try getting physical with me! I don't like it! -I'm afraid, my reckless little virgin, you'll learn to love me. Or... tractors. -I'm sorry, Klaus. Forgive me, please, I shouldn't have done that. I'm so sorry. -What are you doing? Riechtmann! Riechtmann! Riechtmann! Get me out of this!

Where did you drop from? -Which way can Iget out, please, this way or this way? -The stage area is quicker. -Okay. -But relax, honey,relax, you are safe here. No questions asked. Do you want to hide? Or do you want a job? -Doing what? -Nothing. We dress you up pretty, put you on that little seat, swing you out over the audience. You smile and throw souvenirs. 200 marks plus protection... against the wall, ja? -Ja. -Ja, Ja, Ja. -Excuse me sir, but what happened to the last girl? -She was a threat to the audience. She kept getting seasick! -All over the audience? -Ja, Ja!

[belching] You see? -With an idiot like you as my chief agent, I'm going to have an ulcer! -Yeah, well... [buzzer] -Yes? Put him on. Hello, my friend. -All right. I guess by now you have enough proof from those dummies of yours that I really have Paula Schultz. -Oh, well, they were just checking, it'S a routine matter, you understand. -Yeah, look, I'll be at the entrance to Tannhauser park tomorrow at noon. If you really want your star athlete, you'll have somebody there with $75 000 or I turn her over to West Berlin authorities. -Tomorrow, noon. You have my word of honor. -Good. I'll be on the first bench, wearing a red tie. -A red tie? Red, that's our favorite color! -Figures. We've got ourselves a deal, my friend? -It's a deal, my friend! It's a deal, it's a deal! [romantic music] -I couldn't sleep. [Bill] I'm not doing too well myself. -It's my fault. -Matter of fact, it is. -I'm sorry I disturbed you. -The night shirt you're wearing isn't exactly an aid to tranquility. -I hope Mrs. Sweeney doesn't mind. But it's a dream, isn't it? -Yeah. Yeah, sure is. -And I want to thank you for making a couple of mine come true. Sir Gallahad. -Barking up the wrong castle, Schultzy. My armor's a little rusty. -It looks very shiny to me. Well, then... Good night again. -Schultzy. [sigh] Sir Gallahad feelslike a little drink. And you? -I guess now that I'm free, I can be as wicked as I want to be. Oh, but tonight, only a glass of soda water, please. -Yeah, yeah. -William Sylvester Mason? -Don't you ever dare use that name in public. -My lips are sealed. Bill, do you think...-Not if I can help it. [Paula] No, all I meant to say is do you think it would be safe for us to go to the refugee center in the morning? -Refugee center? -Uh-huh. -Oh, oh, yeah, yeah. Go there first thing in the morning. [romantic music] -Oh, William Mason. You're wonderful,wonderful, wonderful. -It'd make things a lot easier if you stopped saying that. And don't trust me any further than you can throw your javelin. Now shut up and go to bed. -Well, someday,sometime, you have to trust somebody, don't you? Isn't there more to life than just compromise? -Yeah, maybe, Schultz, maybe. If you've got the luck and guts to find it. -Maybe we'll find it together, hm? -Good night. [Paula] Sylvester! Sylvester! ♪ On Wisconsin ♪ On Wisconsin ♪ [knocking] -Who is it?

There's nothing I can do! -All right! Too bad. Can't depend on a friend. -Look. All I have is my next week's allowance from Barbara. -Great, $45,that's just enough to get Paula to London! -Wait a minute!-Oh, come on, Sweeney! I'll never forget youfor this! -But... I wish you would! [humming] [Rocco] Going someplace, Billy boy? -Didn't we do this before? -You didn't answer my question. -What was the question? -Going someplace? -Yeah, I was just about to take out some dirty laundry. -All the way to London? -He's going to get our moneyfrom the Queen. -Is she in the bag too? -Hey, look, fellas. I was just about to make some sensational new British connections. You'll love it. See you later! -Oh, how can wedo business with you if you're not alive? -All right. Knock me off, you don't get your money. All I need is a little more time. -Your time has run out, we've been listening. -I hate snoops. -It looks like Schultz is your only remaining asset. How much does she weigh? -About 125 pounds, why? -Quick figuring... brings it to $600 a pound, that is... That is... -$75 000. [Rocco] That's right! That will bring backour investment very nicely. -Oh come on, Rocco, you're a gentleman of the old world! Now, you wouldn't really want me to toss that sweet kid back over the wall, would you? [dramatic music] I guess you would. -As long as you're notgoing to deliver Schultz, we will. Now get her on the phone, and we'll tell you what to say. Go on, move! [church bell ringing] -The rain in Spain fall mainly on the plain. -That's the new code, comrade jackass! -All right, knock it off, comrades, where's the money? -Not so fast, my friend, where's Schultz? -Over there on the bench. -After her! -Hey! The big brown dog leaps down. [protesting] -But this is not Schultz. Oh, you double... [screaming in pain] -You can take your cut, I'll be on my way. [Rocco] There is your cut. [speaking German] -Where is she? -Don't get excited, my friend. The real broad is right over there. By the statue of the Greek broad. -You right about that? -Would I lie to you? -I can trust you. You have an honest face. -Oh, Roc! Come on, Roc, don't let the hinies get her! -Just a little added punishment, Billy boy. -And no cut? -I'm sorry, Billy boy, but you cost us so much additional expense in collecting our investment. [groaning] [romantic music] -Welcome, gentlemen from the Deutsche Demokratische Republik. Oh, comrade Klaus. You know, I'm really glad you finally caught me. I missed you, you know? -Oh, I knew you cared! [screaming] [upbeat music] [screaming] Get off me! Get off me, minister, and go after her! After her! After her! [upbeat music] -Look, she's got away! -Don't worry, comrades, we won't sleepuntil we catch her! [screaming] -Mister Sweeney! -What are you doing back here? -The communist policeare after me! -Is that Barbara's dress? -Yes, yes. -Look what you did to Barbara's dress! Oh my gosh, she'll kill me! She'll kill me! -Mister Sweeney, please, mister Sweeney! You've got to help me, mister Sweeney, please! -Listen, you've gotto get out of that, right away! And you've gotto get out of here before she comes home! [Paula] Mister Sweeney, please, I need help! -What's the matter? -Oh, mister Sweeney, my zipper's stuck! [grunting] Mister Sweeney!-Oh my God! [Paula] Mister Sweeney, that tickles! [Herbert] Bend over, bend over! -Oh, mister Sweeney! [grunting] -Mister Sweeney, it hurts! -Oh, hi honey. Your zipper's stuck. -So are you,you sex fiend! -Now wait a minute, honey! No, wait, just... -Mister Sweeney? -Now, honey, this poor girl happens to be Paula... Happens to be a defector. And... As a CIA agent, it's one of my secret dutiesto offer her asylum. -And as your wife, it is my duty to commit you to one! -No, honey! [Bill] Sweeney, Herb! -Oh, Bill, darling! -Paula. -Bill! -Honey!-I never thoughtI'd see you alive again. -The feeling is mutual and awful. Herb? You rescued her! The good old CIA, where'd you find her? -In my bedroom. The good old CIA never sleeps! -Darling, you must promisenever to let me out of your sight again. Ever. -Cookie, from here on in, I'm going to stand guard over you 24 hours. Neither of us is goingto set foot outside this place. -Oh, ducky, a coupleof starboarders. -Herb, didn't you tell her who this is? [Herbert] She wouldn't let me. -This is Paula Schultz. -And I'm Barbara Sweeney. -Barbara doesn't dig sports or politics. Honey, Paula here is the great East German athlete who has set new records in the broad jump and the javelin throw. -So how come she couldn'twork my zipper? -The red police would do anything to nab her and take her back. Over my dead body. -Mine too. -They're on her tail right now! -Who isn't? -Look, I've got to findsome place to hide her out until I can figure out a wayto get her out of the country! -Guess where, mastermind? Welcome to Sweeney hall. You poor kid. -Thank you very much,Mrs. Sweeney, that's very nice of you. Thank you. -That's your pretty, beautiful barbie doll. I owe you two a lot. -About $1500 at 6% interest. -Look, let me dosomething for you guys. While Paula and Iare hiding here, why don't you usemy suite at the hotel? Have a ball,like a second honeymoon, at my expense! Signed for everything,dining, dancing... romancing. The whole bit! -Can we eat and drink up$1500 in 48 hours? -Well, we can try. We'll take you up on that. -Good, I'll get in touch with the hotel manager. -When is your hotel bill due? -Monday. -Fine, we'll be out on Sunday night. Excuse me. I'll get you something to wear. With... buttons. -So? Love conquers all, huh? -It conquers nothing. Let's have a drink. -Say. Are red agents really after Schultz, or is this just a new gimmick for shacking up? -They're not only after her,they're after me, now. I'm on a real bind. -So what else is new? -It took 75 000 to pay off the hoods. -So now the commies willwant to cut your throat. -You've got a fast mind,what's the answer? -All you need is 75 000. -Oh, the CIA oughtto be proud of you! -If you really want to be safe, I could send you to prison for selling girls. -Wait a minute. Wait a minute, I thinkyou hit on something. If the East Germansare willing to give up all that doughto have Paula Schultz back, our government oughtto be willing to part with a few thousandto have a world famous defector. Right? -Right. What sensational propaganda for our side. Uncle Sam gives Paula Schultz asylum. -Daring rescue engineered by government agentH. Sweeney. -Yeah. Yeah, I'm overdue for a promotion. This could do it! -Yeah, yeah,come on, go! Telephone! -I'll call the chief and have himrush out a check for... -10 000. -10 000? Then I could get herto America. Or else, to the penitentiary. -All right then, just enough to cover all necessary expenses for Schultz's escape! Like the $1500 I owe you. Right? -That makes sense. Yeah, Barbara would like that. -Good. Simply convince your chief that if the commies are willing to part with 75 000, the United States ought to be willing to part with... Would they believe nine? -Well, we wouldn't wantto appear cheap in the eyesof the whole world. -Sweeney. I've got an idea. -So have I! [humming] -No, no, no,no, no, no! First, I want some romance. -Anything you want, sweetheart, you just name it. -No, no! I want to go downstairs to the grill and dance! -Dance? Are you sick, we'd bebetter off at a movie! -But dancing does things to me. -It does thingsto me too, it makes me tired. -Not tonight, tiger. Tonight... You roar. -Oh Barbara...-Come on, get dressed. Come on, come on! -Well? -Perfect. -You see, the manwho marries me not only getsa champion athlete, but also a champion cook! -We're a cinch to live happily ever after. Little Paula sweetie. Tomorrow, you're going to start all over. -Darling, I don't knowwhat I'd do without you. -Just don't try. -Bill. Do you think it was wise letting the Sweeneysgo to your place? You know, those East Germanfriends of mine might just go lookingfor us there. -They wouldn't be that dumb. And they know we're notstupid enough to go back there. -If they are smart, they might figure us not stupid, stupid, therefore, it would be smart to be stupid! -That is the most stupid thingI ever heard of. -But on the other hand, if they are clever, maybe we won't be clever! So it would be not clever... -Oh, shut up! If you want to go to Mason'sroom and look around, go! Stupid. -Jawohl,sir, I mean, yes, komissar. -You know,on second thought, maybe those fellowswould be smart enough to figure outthat we think they're not so stupid. -What are you talking about? -Klaus and company might gobarging in on the Sweeneys. [phone ringing] -Sounds like Bill's phone. -So, it's for Bill,it's not for us. -They must reallybe having a ball, they're not answeringthe phone. I gotta get over there. -I'm going with you. -Are you out of your beautiful skull? -Have you forgottenthe promise you made to me? -Which one? -Never to leave me aloneever again. -I had to open my big mouth. [instrumental music] [buzzer] -Ja? Ja, ja? Ja, ja? Hummingbird? Bald eagle here. They're there? Keep an eye on them, we come right over! -I guess my stupid suggestion was the smartest thing I ever did. -Oh, hummingbird. You mustn't mind when I say that you're stupid, incompetent, inept. It's nothing personal! -Jawohl,my bald eagle. -Ja, ja. Bald eagle. -If Sweeney's waitingaround here, they're liableto pick him up anywhere. -Maybe they're downstairs in the bar. -Come on. -You and your dancing! -How was I to know the orchestra would go home at midnight? -You don't know it, but I told themto go home early. -Sweeney! You're a sexy devil! [humming] [chatter] [humming] -Whoa! Oh, you dirty... -No, no, Sweeney, don't wet the bed! Don't wet the bed, don't wet the bed! -You'll be sorry! You'll be sorry! Just you wait! -I'm waiting! Oh, no! I'm waiting! [giggling] [muffled] I'm waiting! [giggling] [muffled] Oh no! -Where could they have gone? -I'm gonna check the night club down the street, I'll be right back. Keep the lights off and the door locked. [romantic music] [screaming] -They're after me, they're in there! -Run! [muffled giggling] -Oh my God! -Out, out! -Back to Sweeney's, come on! [muffled] -Let me go! -Excellent workon that, Weber! -It just proves that the dumbest thing can be the smartest thing, if it just so happens that the smart thing was a dumb thing. -Let it go, nevermind! -I knew you'd come backto me, my Liebchen! [groaning] -Who the hell are you? -Dummkopf, who's this? -It's supposed to be Paula Schultz. Isn't it? -Wait until Sweeney hears about this! -How did she do that? -Get rid of her! -Stop the car! Stop the car! Stop it! -Sweeney! [sirens blaring] -Hi, honey. How do you feel? -How do I feel? How do you think I feel, you big ape? I spent the night in jail! I called you 15 times, where were you? -Honey, I fell asleep. -Give this, please. -I fell asleep... Your friend, your buddy, getting mixed upin a mess like this... I'll kill him! I'll kill him! -He's my friend. I'll kill him! -Did you see who I saw? -Yeah, it's him! [car horn honking] -Follow him! -Fix me a drink, a big one! -Hey! Where have you two been? We looked for you all over last night, we couldn't find you. -For a damn good reason. Sherlock Holmes couldn't find me either. -Now, Babs, I... -Where is big mouth Mason? -Oh, he just went up the street. He'll be here any minute. Anything wrong? -Well, I suggest that you wait for him outside. You're not hiding hereany longer. -Now wait a minute, it's not Paula's fault! -Zip your lip! -Did I give you any trouble, Mrs. Sweeney? -Out, out. -I'm sorry. -Raus! And you can mail backmy outfit! The drink. -Here, dear. [knocking] -If that's your friend Mason,throw him out too! -Yes, dear. -Madam, I regret this intrusion, but where is Paula Schultz? -These are the skunksthat kidnapped me! Arrest them, Sweeney! -Yes, dear. -Please... Don't you move! -Where is she? [Bill]Barbara, don't open your mouth. -That's an impossibility. -Oh, my hero. [Klaus] Please. Will you force us to be nasty? -All right, then! One more step and I break his arm, come on, drop your gun. -Let me in! -Paula, you can't help, go away! [Paula] Let me in! Oh, darling! Let him go, please... -Will you get the hell out of here? -Oh, excuse me. -Halt! Comrade Schultz, why don't you return to your homeland voluntarily and we will forget all aboutthat little defection of yours. -Our republic,we hate to use force. -Because we are such loving people! Besides, you are so good at running and jumping! -And she's also pretty good at screaming too, which you're going to do as soon as you hit that street. -We will see about that! Comrade Schultz, out! -Evening. Agent Sweeney. -This is him. -CIA? -Oh, please, no violence! -There's your party! -That's she, all right. -It sure is. -Well... Welcome to the west, miss Schultz. -Thank you.-Just a moment! Comrade Schultz is returningto East Germany voluntarily! -Oh, no! -We made a prior arrangementwith this man! -That plan's all washed up! Now just go along with our government...-Just a minute! When do we get backthe $75 000 we paid for comrade Schultz?-Don't pay attention to him, honey, go along! -Now wait, wait a minute! We just paid 9000 to get over here. -Herbert had nothing to do with it. This is the louse that's responsible for everything. He'd sell his own grandmother. -Honey, I can straighten the whole thing out. -I have it straight. Comrade Klaus... -Now, if you wish to stay, we can handle it. It's all up to you, miss Schultz. -No thank you, I'll... -How can you let a little thing like this upset you? -Excuse me. -Wait a minute! -Sorry about this. -Just a minute! Take this with you, I want to fumigate the apartment. And this one too. -Fumigate. Before, she just hated me. Now she loathes me. -I've got to get her backsomehow. -What do you want Barbara for? She hates you even more than she hates me. -I'm talking about Paula! -Oh. -Never thoughtI'd lose my cool over a female shotputter. -I know just how you feel, buddy boy. Every time I couldn't get Barbara on the phone, I wanted to drown myself in the blue dam. That's how we got our favorite song. ♪ Way down upon the Swanee river ♪ -Bartender, don't give himany more to drink, huh? I've gotta get Paula back if I have to take onthe whole red army. -Great, that's a good idea. Then you can do something for me. -What? -Take on an absolute insurance policy... in Barbara's name, and if anything happens to you, I can get my $1500 back. Then I can go home. Oh, right now I gotta go. -I've gotta find a waythrough or over that wall. -Or under it. Dig yourself a hole in the ground, and cover yourself up. -A hole in the ground... Sweeney? Has the army still got that tunnel into East Berlin? -No, no, they blew that up. -Figured. -But they got another one. -Where? -Wait here. -Where? Come on, tell me. -Don't tell anybody. -No, no, come on. Bartender? Where can we get a steam bath and a bucket of hot black coffee? [speaking German] -Danke, danke. Come, let's go. -If my chief knew I was doing this without permission. I'd be canned, you know that. -Are you kidding?

Now just knock on the doorand say "you take boarders?" -You take boarders? -Come in. A nice airy room. With very nice closet. -Yeah, you've seen one, you've seen them all. -Go in, look around.
