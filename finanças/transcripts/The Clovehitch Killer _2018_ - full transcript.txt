[Film reel ticking] Subtitles by explosiveskull The first murder happened before I was born. The killer called himself Clovehitch after his favorite type of knot. Our town lived in fear. And then, ten years ago, he stopped. Every year, our community had a memorial for friends and family of the victims. At the time, I didn't think about it much. [birds chirping] Someone has to be leading the detail. Why? Anyone? To keep everyone in step, that's number one. Number two, here, stand up, come here. In my day, what we did was flag up, shoulders back. Put your shoulders back. There you go. Now, if it's windy on that day what's his other arm gonna do? - Steady the flag. - Right. Then on the day.. You two, come up here. Side to side. Your job is you're gonna.. You're gonna push. Here. Right? Shoulder to shoulder. You're gonna keep that formation solid for the flag bearer who's got the weight of the flag plus wind. Very, very nice. Okay, great job. Have a seat. How about giving them a round of applause? [applauding] [grunting] [groans] Hey, bud. I, uh, I've been meaning to talk to you. [sighing] Work's been slow and, uh, Uncle Rudy's insurance is going up, so I can't.. I can't send you to leadership camp. Yeah, but I... I need it to stand out on my application. That's what the recruiter said. Yeah, it's just, um, you know, we... we're gonna we're gonna work on your rank together. It's just gonna take a bit longer before you're flyin' around at Mach one. Oh. - Let me get that. - No, I got it. Yeah, I got it, I got it, I got it. Oh, no! Oh-ho, we got him. You may be getting taller, but I can still kick your butt. - Quit. - Say it. - No! - Say it. - Say it. - Uncle. There you go.

She always does the same report about the killings every year. What, do you have a crush on her or something? That's disgusting. Don't you know she did it with, like, five different football players because her mom left the family to be a stripper? We should pray for her. Or maybe call the cops. Tyler, you can speak with Billy later. We have rounds to do. - I'll see you later. - See ya.

He was like a layman, he wasn't like a.. Put that away, please. ...like Jeremiah. He was a layman. He lived his whole life in the arena of Babylonian politics.

[cell phone vibrates] ...without reservation he believed in the power of God. That's why he made that appointment with Nebuchadnezzar. He said.. You're addicted to this thing. I don't like it. I need to see that. [cell phone vibrates] I just need to see who's texting. He believed in the power of God. What's so important?

[squeaking] [dramatic music] [whirring] [sighing] Tyler, give me a hand out here! Tyler? [sighing] Tyler? [keyboard clacking] What are you doing? Oh, I was just online finishing up some school stuff. [sighing] I am very disappointed. - Um, Mom.. - Go to bed. Mom.. Go to bed, Tyler. Yes, ma'am. [sighing] [knocking] Mom says we have to have a little talk. Have a seat. [sighing] Our secret. Just the men folk. I've been keeping another secret for you, bud. I know you took my truck the other night. Mom worries about you driving, 'cause of Uncle Rudy but I figure you're old enough to sneak out once or twice. But now we have to straighten a few things out that might be confusing you. Like what you're looking at on the computer at... I wasn't looking at anything. Okay. Sex. There, I said it. [sighing] You know we're made in God's image. That means your body is a holy thing not to be desecrated. You know what that means? But, men like you and me we got thoughts. We got thoughts that start to.. [chuckles] Start to pop into our heads. You ever get those thoughts, bud? Thoughts about girls? I get it. I mean, believe it or not, I was 16 once. We're in a bit of a pickle, aren't we? We got God over here on this side and we got a sex-crazed monkey over here on this side. You with me so far, bud? Not really. Here's the thing. It's okay to have thoughts. That's just a fantasy. God will look the other way. He's a busy man. But no pictures. Got it? A fantasy's okay, it's not real. It's just.. It's just monkey stuff. You can't control what pops into your head, right? I mean, what if a thought popped into your head right now, a bad thought? Something like, I don't know.. You know, grabbing one of these, these tools in here and wham! You'd never do it in real life, right? Never. Hah. It's just, just monkey stuff, right? Yeah, monkey stuff. Oh.. There. We did it. Awkward talk with Dad over. Car wash. Can I talk to you about something? I told you, I'm busy. Come on, one minute. The reason I had that thing that Amy saw wasn't what you think. I'm trying not to think about it. I don't like that stuff at all. It's shown me something, something bad. Something that I... I can't get out of my head. I... I know it's probably not true but I think I just need to talk to somebody about it because... I'm gonna stop you right there. I know where you're going with this and I'm not going to discuss it. - What? - It's a sin. And you have a choice. - Billy, come on. - It's a choice. I'm not even gonna. The fuck you following me for? You remember me, right? Tyler the perv. How's the perving? Why are you always reading the newspaper outside of our church? I like bad news. - Okay. - And I can sit wherever I want. I thought you people were supposed to be all friendly and giving and shit? No, of.. No, yeah, no. It's totally fine. Great. Hey, um, you know about that Clovehitch stuff, right? 'Cause I was thinking maybe I could ask you a few questions 'cause I was on some bad website and... Oh, I get it. [laughing] You heard that rumor about me and the five guys on the football team. - And you thought that if you... - No. No, no, no. It's okay. I'm a slut, you're a perv. We were made for each other. Okay. Cut it out. So serious. No one will know. It's just you and me down here. Whip it out. Let's see what we're dealing with. I'm fucking with you! - No, I know. I really.. - Do you? Wait. No, no. I really.. I just.. I want to know about Clovehitch. That's all, really. Just like the suspects, and... and how you could eliminate certain suspects. Why? Why do you all of a sudden care about this stuff? Are you trying to convert me? - Or is this for a merit badge? - No! No! I.. I don't know. It's just stuck in my head. I just went to the memorial the other day and I didn't know any of them, but, still. I thought maybe talking to you about it could help or something. But I don't know. It's probably just stupid. It's not stupid. Come here after 3:00. I'll help you. [sighing] Bring cookies. [brakes squeaking] Can I help you? Uh, I'm sorry, ma'am. I'm looking for Kassi. I brought cookies. Kassi, your little friend is here. I didn't think you'd show. Your grandma's interesting. [scoffs] She's not my grandma. Dumbass. She used to work for the cops. She made a copy of all their files and wrote this book. Sit. And here's everything on his ten official victims. This is victim number eight, Erica Lytle. She was a fifth grade teacher. Clovehitch knew when she would be alone. Sorry, it's pretty graphic. Did they take any Polaroid pictures? No, it's all digital. Why? So this is all the evidence? There's not much. No fingerprints, no blood, no semen, just the rope. Well, rope fibers. And this. Belonged to victim four, Sasha Peterson. Found outside First Baptist. She never went there, I checked. So you were staking out our church to.. What, narrow it down? Whoever was going back there? No. Cops already did that. I'm using the FBI playbook. I'm gonna catch him using his weakness. And what's that? He's insane. Every killer has an MO tied to his psychology. It's like a fingerprint. Look. Same entry points, same elaborate ropes on the bodies the clove hitch tied to every victim's house, his signature. He's taunting the cops, using the victims as trophies. It's meticulous and planned. I'm gonna use that fingerprint to connect him to new cases. I don't think he's stopped killing. I think there's more than ten victims. But he has stopped. Serial killers can't stop. This one, or this one? This one. Okay. Ahem! You know, I was thinkin' of volunteering. Mm-hmm. Maybe, uh, doing some tutoring during the afternoons. Where would that be? Oh, over at St. Joseph's. I was talkin' to Billy's friend Martin. He goes there. I think you met him a couple years ago. He's a really nice guy. We donated to their food drive, I think. Well, that's very generous of you, Tyler. But, keep it to afternoons. Evenings is family time. Yes, ma'am. - No! - Gin. - No! - No! - Cheating! - How about that? Again? Don't hate me 'cause I'm beautiful. [instrumental music] You can pull the wool over your mother's eyes, but not mine. Who was it you were visiting when you're supposed to be tutoring? [sighing] My boy's got himself a girlfriend. [chuckles] Oh. You know about that? Problem is, you lied to your mother. Oh. W... we.. We really just study. That's all. Remember what we talked about before? No, her grandma's there. It's... it's not like that. Yeah, I know. Tell you what. Mom doesn't have to know you're lying but she needs to meet this girl. Invite her over for dinner tomorrow night. I don't know if that's a good idea. I'll have her make her a casserole. Okay. Yes, sir. Hey, would you want to go to dinner tonight at my house? No. My parents want to meet you. - Why? - Um.. They think we're going out and, uh.. Whoa. - What? - Hm? You know we're not going out, right? Yeah, no. No, of course. No, no, no. Duh, obviously. I just thought.. You know, they just.. They know we're hanging out, and so.. They're not gonna try to convert me to the ways of Jesus, are they? The only thing would be don't talk about Clovehitch 'cause they don't know about anything like that, but.. I mean, don't talk about anything. Great. I'm definitely coming. Mmm. Great tilapia, hon. So, Kassi, where do you go to church? Oh, I don't go to church. Um, my dad's usually hungover on Sundays and my mom left when I was little. So, um, I'm basically an atheist but I'm considering getting into Wicca. Wicca? Wha.. No, I've heard of that. It... it's not black magic, it's um.. - A nature-based spiritual... - Oh, Mom. - She's... she's just joking. - Oh, geez. This family doesn't have your sense of humor. Um, she goes to a church across town. Kassi, I hear that, um, you visit an elderly lady? Um, yeah. She is a retired. She used to... That's her grandma. Mavis, yeah. She's a retired secretary at the bank. Tyler, let her answer for herself. Was he this nervous when he asked you out, Kassi? Oh, no. Not at all. He was real smooth. Incredible. So smooth, I didn't realize that he'd asked. Oh, I think I know exactly what you mean. This one over here's the same way. I practically proposed to him myself. Oh, come on. I had that whole ring and speech and I did the one knee. - You exaggerate. - Oh, you did great. - Come on. - You did great. [clears throat] So, Mr. Burnside, um.. You teach Tyler and everybody about camping and whittling.. [coughing] Tying knots? Well, Kassi, it's not just about outdoor preparedness anymore. You know, they got, they got badges now for, um computer programming and and photography.. All kinds of things. But, yeah, I love whittling and knots. You got me. [chuckles] How many knots do you know? Why don't we talk about something else? [chuckles] This... this is pretty boring. Well, she asked. I'm sorry about the bad joke earlier. I really like spending time with Tyler. I wouldn't want to give the wrong first impression. I just get really nervous and say the wrong thing. - I'm sorry. - Oh.. Not at all, sweetheart. Not at all. And you don't need to be nervous. You are the best young lady that he has brought home to meet us. [Kassi giggles] - Also the only one. - Don. [laughing] Sorry about the whole fish thing. I, I don't even think they know what vegan is. Pull over. So.. You think your dad is Clovehitch? [laughing] You should see your face! [laughing] It's not your fucking dad. Your dad? He has pictures. - Tyler... - Like bondage porno stuff. That's why everyone thinks I'm a perv. I went in his shed where no one is allowed, and there was more. There was even one that said Nora on it, and. I think that was for Nora Devlin. Right next to it, it says, "Lucky's favorite" on it. - I'm serious. - Lucky? Yeah. [laughing] There's no way in hell your dad is Clovehitch just because he likes weird porn. He's just kinky. [laughing] My gosh. Come on, let's go. What, did you think we were gonna make out? - Drive. - Oh. [engine starts] ♪ I've been doing all the dishes ♪ ♪ All day long ♪ ♪ Though I never get a nickel ♪ ♪ ...all the odd jobs around this house ♪ Oh, look who it is! ♪ Mr. Romance has returned ♪♪ Come on, dance with me. I... I've seen moves on you tonight that I've never seen in my entire life, mister. [indistinct singing] [knocking on window] [knocking continues] [knocking continues] What the heck? What are you doing here? Lucky got stuck in my head. I couldn't... - Shh! - I couldn't sleep. So I went through everything, and I went back to Barbara's which she was not happy about. But I found it. Victim number five, she got a note in her mailbox a week before she was killed. Guess what it said? [sighing] It's gone. [dog barking] Let's go. Let me see. Are you sure it said "Lucky?" - I don't know. - I feel something. Oh, hey. - Shit. - What is that? [dramatic music] Does that look like your father's handwriting, Tyler? I don't know. Where is this? My dad will be up soon. Come to Barbara's as soon as you can. Don't let him know you know, okay? You okay? You okay? Yeah. [dramatic music] [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] [knocking on door] Tyler? Morning, sunshine. Oh, hey, Dad. What time is it? Almost 7:00. Thought we'd get an early start. What? You know what we haven't done in a while? Camping. Just you and me. - Um.. Yeah, today? - Yeah. Thought we'd go have some fun. Father-son bonding. Lock up that rifle badge. Yeah. No, that'd be great. I just feel kind of sick, though. Ah, come on. I'll make you some cereal. Get dressed. [instrumental music] [music continues] Where are we going? We're almost there, bud. Did you tell anyone? Did you tell anyone? - What are you talking about? - Tyler. I know you've been in the shed and in the crawlspace. You had no business invading my privacy. The lack of respect is really disturbing, Tyler. You know better than that. A lock on that door for a reason. What you found in that box wasn't mine. Whose is it? Rudy's. Uncle Rudy? The truth is, I'm ashamed to say.. I had an interest in those kinds of photos that you found in the truck a long time ago, years ago. Rudy was the same way, only much, much worse. I knew that from when we were kids, but still. When I found that stuff in his trailer I went to him and I said "Rudy, you gotta turn yourself in." But then... then he tried to.. ...you know.. I thought it was a car crash. It was. He drove off the road. Well, why do you have that stuff? I was gonna burn it. I swear to God, I was gonna burn it. But the victims' families.. ...they have a right to know. Look, then it was never the right time, you know? Susie being born, or some darn thing and.. Then I had to think about our family it'd be rough on you kids. And to put your mom through that? For what? Not gonna bring anybody back. But it looks like it's you. Bud. Bud, I don't know, I don't know what else to tell you. Other than I know that you know.. ...it isn't me. It's not me. I'm just so.. I'm just so damned sorry to to put you through all that. I messed up. I was trying to protect my brother. We have to take it to the police. Or destroy it. But you have to decide. [instrumental music] [music continues] [music continues] Knot tying exemplifies the skills and the strength of a troop or family. The rope weaves the fibers together and the knot bends them to a common purpose. The square knot used in first aid is a symbol of service to others. - You went camping? - You can't be.. What? I waited and waited and I go by your house and your mom tells me you went camping. Shh! You talked to my mom? I thought he was onto us. No! Keep your voice down. No. He just wanted to take me camping, okay? Good, because I figured it out. It's your house. - What? - Duh, there's a pit under there. - You went under my house? - I couldn't wait. What if he took you camping to get rid of you? Did you find anything under there? - No. He never finished it. - Kassi, that's 'cause it's not him. I asked him about the pictures and everything and he explained it to me. What? How did he explain the blueprints? It's a fantasy. It's not real. What about Lucky? I gotta go back inside. Just believe me that it's not. - Well, then who is it? - I don't know. I'll call you later. I know you don't wanna believe it, but just face it. Look at this. This really happened. No, I don't want to deal with this now! What are you doing? Billy, go back inside. Hey, give me that. You're disgusting, you know that? - Billy, come on. - This is depraved. - Billy, give me it! - Why don't you just come out of the closet already? - Hey. - F you, slut! Hey! [grunting] - Hey! - Get off of me! Hey! Stop! Hey, buddy. I just got one question for you. Where's Tyler Burnside? What? Where's Tyler Burnside? 'Cause the Tyler I know wouldn't resort to violence to settle his disputes. Okay, I get it. Pastor Randy, I'm Tyler. I just lost my temper. You know, that's gonna be some shiner. Everything okay at home? Yeah, it's fine. Oh, I love you so much. Please be careful, okay? Mom, don't worry, I will. You're getting so heavy! I'm gonna get real fat when you're gone so you don't recognize me. [laughing] Alright. Have a good time. Thanks again, Dad, for coming through with the money. Eh, I figure you learned all you can from me. Have fun. I will. Alright. Better get going. My little man. I love you. I'll see you soon, okay? - Love you! - Bye! Bye! [instrumental music] I think I made too much. Mm. More for me. When's Tyler come home? In two shakes of a lamb's tail. How long is that? You know, that's what grandma always used to say to me and I never asked her. You're one smart cookie, you know that? Why don't you go visit your mom for a while? You wanna swim in grandma's lake? Yay! You can take time off? Nah! I wish I could, honey. But, um, you know, swamped with work. You go for a week or two. I'll check on Rudy at the center and then I'll come up the last weekend and I'll drive back down with yous. - Mom would like that. - Mm. - You wanna go see grandma? - Mm-hmm. Alright. We'll call her after dinner and tell her we're coming. - Okay. - Okay. [heavy breathing] Sorry. It's okay. [sighing] - Something bothering you? - No. You wanna talk about it? I.. I'm fine, it's just.. [snickers] Just getting old. Maybe I shouldn't go to Mom's. It's nothing. Come here. Come on. You don't have to worry. Ever.

Oh, no, thanks. - Um, is Tyler home? - Tyler? Oh, didn't he tell you he was going away to leadership camp? Oh, um, we haven't been talking much lately. Oh. Uh... it's a nice camera. Is that real film? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Oh, you-you like photography. [chuckles] You were the one with all those, uh those crime scene photos the day of the-the big fight, right? Yeah. Here.

And before he even gets to the door the father sees him from a distance. And scripture says the father runs to seek him out.

Anyway, Mom sends her love and, uh, she wants you to bring your tools when you come up, 'cause there's a bunch of little jobs she has in mind for you. Oh, someone wants to say hello to you.

But he was a real S-O-B. Let me tell ya. Put your hands, please. I'll be out of here in two shakes of a lamb's tail. [woman grunting] That's tight. Oh, it's not too bad. [woman sobbing] Mm. Lucky likes your shampoo. [gasping] [groaning] [whirring] [woman groaning] [gasping] [woman sobbing] [sobbing continues] [woman screaming] [clicking] Dad. What are you doin' here? Is she okay? You should be gone. Oh, Tyler. You shouldn't see this. Dad! What did I teach you? You don't aim a weapon unless you intend to use it. [instrumental music] Are you gonna shoot me, bud? You can't just leave notes out for me like that. My parents are gonna find them. I like the black eye. It's a good look for you. You should've just taken the pictures, though. I thought you were gonna stop? I am. Come up. This is Nora Devlin's house. The only places I know are Clovehitch places. I'm sorry. Look, I wanna hang out with you. But it can't be about this Clovehitch stuff. Especially not about my dad. Okay. I get it. But do you even believe me? Do you really believe me? I feel her sometimes. What? Let's go in. [sighing] - No. - Come on. No! Let's go. [instrumental music] [music continues] He, um, came in through the basement. And then tied her up.. ...and tortured her here. Then he killed her. This is where they found the body. Why are you doing this? What did your dad tell you? Tyler. I'm not accusing your dad. I just wanna know what happened. It was Uncle Rudy. In the wheelchair? How long has he been like that? Ten years. That's why he stopped. He told me it was a car accident but... it was suicide. Attempted suicide. I found something in the pit under your house. Y... you said there was nothing under there. There were rope fibers. - Rope fibers? - Yeah. [sighing] This isn't CSI. Look, I know that you love being obsessed with Clovehitch because it makes you all dark and interesting but, but really, this is my family. He killed my mom. What? Clovehitch... killed my mom. I thought, um.. I thought your mom ran away. Yeah. When I was five, my dad came home after a big fight with her. And she was gone and so was her stuff. And we never heard from her again. My dad says that she abandoned us. That's not what I remember. I remember a man coming in and making her cry. And tying her up, and putting me in the bathroom. And her screams. I turned on the water so I didn't have to hear. And it was years later that I heard about Clovehitch.. ...and I knew. But my dad wouldn't listen, no one would listen. I didn't want it to be him, so, no one's believed me. What was her name? Crystal. Crystal Harper? How do you know that? Under the house.. ...there was a box, and it had photos, and jewelry.. ...and driver's licenses. There were 13 of them. Thirteen? Where are they? It wasn't gonna bring 'em back. And he's gone. We had to protect our family. - So where are they? - So we burned them. I'm sorry. Do you believe him? Is there any doubt in your mind? Please. Have a good time. Thanks again, Dad, for coming through with the money. Eh, I figured you learned all you can from me. - Have fun. - I will. [instrumental music] Your dad was a handyman, right? So? Well, it'd explain why there's no forced entry. Case his victims' houses. Uncle Rudy was a handyman too. [music continues] What are you expecting to see? Anything. There's no way he could be that sick and not give any hint. I've lived with him my whole life. There's no hint. Maybe you don't know what a normal dad is like. No, yeah, no, I feel like I'm learning a lot. And the, the counselors have been really helpful and everything's been amazing so far. Yeah, alright. Alright. I gotta go, Mom. No, I love you too. I'll talk to you later. He's following that woman. What woman? The woman in the blue pants. He's staring at her. No, no. He'll see you. He'll see you. [sighing] This isn't gonna work.

We should wait for him to sneak out at night or something. He's gonna see me if we keep following him around in broad daylight. [sighing] [instrumental music] Whose house is that? He's probably just working. We should go. Kassi! Kassi! [music continues] [dog barking] [music continues] - Hey, come on. - Hey. He tied this here. I saw him. [instrumental music] [music continues] Tyler. Tyler. [music continues] It's the woman from the market. [music continues] [music continues] I'll go in with you. No. I need to talk to him alone. [instrumental music] Dad? [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] Come on. [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] [thud] [music continues] [music continues] [sighing] [door closes] [woman screaming] [music continues] [screaming continues] [camera shutter clicks] Dad? What are you doin' here? Is she okay? You should be gone. [sighing] Oh, Tyler. - You shouldn't see this. - Dad! What did I teach you? You don't aim a weapon unless you intend to use it. Are you gonna shoot me, bud? You have to turn yourself in. - Kassi? - Yeah. Go and help her. She's manipulating you. Bud.. Bud, listen to me. I'd never hurt anyone. This, this woman and I are having an affair. We're a little kinky, that's all. I know, I know, this is a lot for you to take in.. ...but your mother knows all about this. She and I... Are you serious with this bullshit? Bud, if this gets out, all you're gonna do is hurt your mom and Susie. I need you to lower your aim. Accidents happen. It's okay, bud. It's okay. She was gonna hurt somebody. You and me, we know about gun safety. Now, I trust you to properly handle a firearm, but not her. I need you to lower your weapon. Let's not become another bad statistic about gun safety. Accidents happen. Good man. I'm very proud of you, bud. Very proud. You're doin' the right thing. [breathes heavily] Remember.. ...butt first. You used to think that was so funny. Butt first. There you go. [sighing] I'm not mad. Just disappointed. [gun clicks] [gasping] [grunting] [choking] [gasping] [Tyler gasping] [Tyler coughing] [breathing heavily] [panting] [instrumental music] [music continues] Tyler, hurry up, please. I can't be late again. Okay. I want pancakes. Well, you're in luck, because oatmeal is pancakes that Big Bird chewed up. - Gross. - Sweetie, please. I need you to be a good little bug for me today, okay? [sighing] Okay, Mom. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Tyler! I'm coming! [music continues] - Amen. - Amen. There's an opening at Billy's uncle's shop. I could pick up a few shifts there next week. [telephone ringing] Hello? Yes, speaking. [music continues] I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. [instrumental music] [music continues] So what should we do now? Nothing. Police won't connect it to Clovehitch. She never saw his face. Yeah. This is what you wanted. Mommy, I don't wanna go to bed. Please! Please! I want someone to sleep with me. I don't want.. - Hey. - Hey. - Can I sit down? - Yeah, sure. The police wanted to talk to you. I told them no. They.. They don't think it was an accident. Do you understand what I'm saying? They think s.. They think somebody killed him? Oh, goodness no. Tyler, no. No, they.. They think that someone as experienced as Don wouldn't just.. Yes, he had his problems but... we... dealt with them together. [sobbing] I told them that. Hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. [sobbing] It's okay. [sobbing] It's okay. [sobbing] Color guard, post the flag of Troop 22. Color guard, post the flag of the United States of America. Color guard, dismissed. And now, Mrs. Burnside, please present the sash. I present to you, the newest inductee into the Order of Light, Tyler Burnside. [applauding] Thank you. Normally, the troop leader would say a few words. So, instead, I'd like to say a few words about him. Donald Burnside, my father. We all saw different sides of him. To our community, he was a leader. To our family, he was a provider. To me, he was a dad. As troop leader, my father helped many of us get our gun safety badges which makes his accident that much more tragic. The truth is bad things happen to good people. Our only defense is to come together like we've done tonight. That's what my dad taught me through how he lived. Let's remember that.. ...how he impacted our lives. [breathing heavily] [instrumental music] [music continues] Dad, if you can hear me.. [crickets chirping] ...I love you.
