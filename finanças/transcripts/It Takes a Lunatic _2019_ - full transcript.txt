I thought I'd just begin by asking you to tell me what first comes to your mind - when you hear the name Wynn Handman. The first thing that comes to my mind when I hear the name Wynn Handman - is the name Wynn Handman. - I never heard of anyone named Wynn, and I don't think I'd ever heard of anyone named Handman, and then I decided his name is so interesting. - He had to be the most interesting person, and I had to meet him. In a few moments you are going to meet Wynn. I think Wynn was an idealist. He represents kind of a keystone... of American theater. Terrific director and a terrific teacher and sort of a good luck charm. He'd make a great horse trainer. He was outspoken. - Crotchety, irritated with everything. He was rude. Wynn was not threatening. He had a wonderful sense of joy. Wynn was... reasonable and rational. He had mixed feelings about success. He was such a... tower of power. - He didn't... bullshit anybody. He's kind of a rough-and-tumble, tough guy. Everybody else was wrong, and Wynn was right. And he's an intellectual and he's a lunatic. That's Wynn Handman. Okay. ? Are you lonesome tonight ♪ - ♪ Do you miss me tonight? ? I'm happy that all of you are here. ? Are you sorry we drifted apart? ? And always, uh... - people wanna call me a nickname, right? - Yes. Handy. So I'll talk a little more about the name. When we're rolling. - Yeah. - We're going back to the beginning. Irwin Leo Handman. 'Born May 19th, 1922. I had a very happy childhood... growing up in a section of Manhattan called Inwood. It was the only house on the street. There was a farm across the street, a real farm. That's true. I had such a happy childhood... that I never wanted to leave Inwood. My mother, she would say, "We call him Sunny." S-U-N-N-Y. My mother seemed to me to be very happy taking care of her children. My father did what fathers did then. He earned his money in order to support his family. My father did not have many diversions, but he did have a real love of going to the racetrack. - He went every Saturday... to Belmont Race Track. But he could not take me, because I was too young to gamble at the racetrack. So he'd come back, I would be waiting for him. And he would describe each race to me with the horses that ran. But he always said, and this was something I remember that my father said to me. Over and over. He would say, "You see, this is first, that's 'Win,' second place is 'Placed,' and the third place is 'Show.' All the rest are 'also-rans.' Don't you be an also-ran." The life and legacy of Wynn Handman. What's wonderful about Wynn is that he has two lives and two legacies. One life is that of an acting teacher. - I remember... - He was... ...on 56th street. I think it was 56th street. It was sort of right behind Carnegie Hall. There are people in life who open doors. Pioneers. Without those people, I don't think we'd have any American theater. - The room itself was upstairs. - Upstairs. The little loft area, pretty tight. The room itself was interesting because there were rows of theater seats, on tiers. And they had a little back room with all the little props. Despite the dinginess, I found it... romantic... and exhilarating. Why did everyone looks so young? Oh, Wynn. He was so young, he was a young man. Of course, he seemed old at the time because we were all kids. Is that me? Is that me standing up there? I think it is. That is me. Wow... Wow, wow, wow... When you actually were doing scenes, we would all have partners. Usually just one other partner. Occasionally two. I remember this. - The watch on the wall. Wynn sat behind a desk, what we could call audience right, in the front row. Oh, yeah. Yep, he would sit right next to the stage. There was a proscenium stage here. - So it was like being in a play, kind of. I remember when I did Wynn's class, it was very much of a scene study class. Okay. This is a rehearsal... - of a new scene. Are we ready to get started? - Let's have a good time. - Okay, places please. - Let's work. Quiet in the house. But this is something we should enjoy. That was Wynn. - I remember he had a light switch. - Say when you're ready please. And he manipulated the lights. - Ready. - He then turned the lights on. - You do your thing. One thing that he said to me that stayed with me, "Great acting doesn't change throughout history." You’ve right dared to ask that, when all knows you’ll be starting to a girl in your own town when your father’s rotten in four months or five. Yeah, he was saying styles change but truth doesn't. - Yeah, good. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. ...but we’re only talking maybe, for a thatched place to hold a fine lad is the like of you. Truth, that's basically what he is all about. - Truthful human behavior... can't be beat. Yeah. You'd do your thing, and when it came to the end of the scene, he'd turn the lights off. And then the lights come back on, - and usually Wynn would discuss the scene right then and there in front of the class. Because part of it was not just the work you as an actor did, part of it was listening to how he criticized - the work of the other actors. - What I like is the language just flows right out of them. It's all about language. You see how fully-flavored that language is? It's from the center, and it flows out. But, you see, it's not just poetic language. It grows out of the characters... You can't treat a class as one person. - Wynn didn't... We didn't spent a lot of time being trees, do you know what I mean? - He had the ability to talk to different students in different ways. And he knew what each actor needed. To say something that meant something to me, and didn't mean a hill of beans to you. Who are you? Let's find out who you are and how you work. In my case, he worked with me for six months on nothing but stillness. Right, you gotta get real to do the improvisation. Wynn drew from me and from all of his students what was theirs to give. He's gonna help you find yourself, - which is all we have to give, anyhow. I would feel good about this as a first rehearsal because I wouldn't want the actors... We all hung on his every word. I remember him being very much about almost the musical shape of things. What's next? - He was great at knowing when to speed up. He goes, "Oh." Literally, speed up. "I don't know. Let's give it another try, but-- Don't work it. Say it fast. Let's just go faster." And all of a sudden, a scene which was very problematic-- We couldn't quite get-- All of a sudden, made sense. - If you did it up to speed, or with the right energy, it worked all of a sudden. Okay, let's go. So, let's just go. Boom. And he flipped the light. And it just took off. Just happened because it was human. - You're kind of built to be an actor. If you have the right environment, a sense of confidence. I was somebody who was totally lacking confidence - and I think he recognized that. And Wynn was renowned for his ability to nurture people. He created a very comfortable environment for people to do their best, for them to gain their confidence. He pretty much... took the fear out of my performing. Just gave me the confidence to just try and do anything. Work on the role and let things happen to him, and you'll discover what he is. You should discover what he is as you work on him. There was something very kind, and gentle, and... fatherly about him. I'll never forget... relatively early on, you know, he pulled me aside and he said, "Would you like me to tell your mother how good you are?" And it was such a relief for somebody in my case where, you know, you got a pretty big shadow between your father. Wynn sensed, you know, - I needed that kind of bolstering... to be relaxed. Everybody relax. There are many acting teachers, - who I don't think really like actors. I've sat in on certain classes where you almost see an abusive approach to how to teach acting. Wynn never had that. You used to go to classes excited, not terrified. With each of his students, Wynn was so encouraging. Never destructive, and for a young actor, you could be destroyed by the words of someone in Wynn Handman's position. It's fragile. I-- I think you have an affinity for this character, but you got to really make him real for yourself. - He's not complicated. - Right. - She's complicated. - Yeah. I want to discover with the actress what it is that we can find in this scene. Right now, you don't have anything, really, to hold onto. No criticism at this point, but you have to know... Wynn gave people the amount of critique they needed and could handle. Wynn said, "Never judge someone else's emotions. They may not be yours... and that's okay." It was a very safe environment. I think it really is important, on a personal level, of "this is my safe place." You're vulnerable in your '20s. You're still trying to figure out not only how to do what you do, but who you are. But in the beginning, there's like a year where it's very easy to walk away from this work. Because it's so odd, so unusual, compared to what the rest of life is like. You think about things that other people spend most of their day avoiding thinking about. They drive you crazy. The depths of drama and characters. It's very unsettling in a way. They dare each other, they take revenge, they scheme, they manipulate, they play games with people's lives, right? That's the world of this play. Not far from the world that many people are living today. - What's next? I realized... little things changed the course of my life. - Chance. It rules your life. I wouldn't have found myself to be in this profession, I don't think, if it weren't for the fact that... I went into World War II. It's when I was on a ship. And I... I could just be more in touch with other parts of myself. I felt things deeply. More deeply than I ever had. And I realized there was an inner life. And I felt that deepness. And it stayed with me. And that changed the course of my life. And I draw on it all the time. Take your time and become the character... who can look back on these times. - Let's get to the reality... - Yes. ...the true thing. Beginnings are strenuous in every class. Beginnings are so important. So the way you are beginning is all wrong. - One Sunday, the radio was on. And they said something about a bombing of Pearl Harbor. I had no idea where Pearl Harbor was. But it sounded bad. How is that impacting on you? I have a natural executive ability. I could command a squad or... a platoon or a company, for that matter! Did you ever even stop to think about that? I didn't want to be drafted into the Army, because when I grew up, we were bombarded with horrors of World War I. Movies of dying on the barbed wire, which were horrible. And I only wanted the Navy. - ? Shipmates stand together ♪ ♪ Don't give up the ship ♪ Being in the Navy was like a great thing. So I had a yearning. I want to be in the Navy. ? I joined the Navy to see the world ♪ ♪ And what did we see? We saw the sea ♪ - There was only one thing. From my childhood, I had an irregular heartbeat. The Navy said, "We cannot take anyone who has an irregular heartbeat." My father told the relatives... that I didn't get into the Navy because I couldn't pass the physical. Well, this was like a blow to my manhood. I had an altercation with my father, and... I don't know for how long, I didn't talk to him. I haven't thought about that in a long time. So I went to the Coast Guard, and they gave me the physical and they said, "You have an irregular heartbeat, but we can take you." I was allowed to finish my college education so that I could enroll in Officer's Candidate School. I didn't have a lot of aptitude for the work. Seamanship was not a strong point. Knots. I learned to make knots. I did not excel. Gunnery, I was terrible. I never hit the target. There was an instructor overlooking what you were doing. If the instructor saw that I couldn't even hit the target, that would be bad. And the guy next to me, who was annoyed when he didn't hit a bull's-eye... So I said, "Hey, give me some holes in my target, will you, please?" He did. So the instructor came along, and he saw that I had a lot of holes in my target. I've been very lucky... my whole life. He has an idea, he's in it, he's doing it, but he hasn't... He hasn't brought this character to life inside him. - He doesn't... It's not organic. - It hasn't grown. I ended up on a ship. My ship was an icebreaker... called the Storis. And I was the youngest officer on that ship. The Germans depended upon weather reports to help them plan their bombing, so they had a weather station six hundred miles north of the Arctic Circle. And our mission was to knock out that weather station. Ballast yourself with reality... then throw yourself into the sea. The sea is inspiration. Well, that's all we're looking for. The release into the unconscious... that comes up with images. You're dealing with images. We were the first ship to capture Germans at sea. We had 22 German prisoners on our ship. When the Germans came aboard the ship, I didn't feel like saluting them. I had a captain who was very strict on what he thought was correct procedure with prisoners. So when he saw I wasn't saluting, he ordered me to salute them when they came aboard. - That to him was protocol. He couldn't imagine... that I was Jewish. Now, with where your voice is right now, say your opening lines. Give me a pack of cigarettes. Marlboro, hard pack. Cigarette smoking was very big during the period of World War II. Very big. As the youngest officer, I had the responsibility of taking care of the ship's service store. - Now the popular brands of cigarettes were Chesterfields, - Luckys, Camels, Philip Morris, and Old Gold. - Now the slowest seller was Old Gold, so I gave the Germans Old Gold cigarettes. So, one time, I was summoned. Make a little megaphone with your hand. "Mr. Handman, report to the captain's cabin." Uh-oh... what did I do? I go there, and he said, "Mr. Handman, I hear that you are only giving the German prisoners Old Gold cigarettes." "Sir, we have a surplus of Old Gold, and--" "You will not discriminate against the German prisoners!" "Aye aye, sir." That was it. Any of you know it? The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial? - These men were on the ship, and certain things were going on, and they couldn't stand it any longer. It could have happened on the ship I was on, but we didn't mutiny. I was on duty. So I'm right there looking down on German prisoners. - I remember I had my Colt .45 and... And, you know, do I have an impulse? Can I take this gun... and shoot that Nazi? Kill him? Do I really want to? I tested my-- I said, "I don't want to shoot him." I didn't want to kill. So I knew I am not a killer. This is the finale. Now we're up there for, not only weeks, but it was going on months. As soon as we get to Boston for what they called rest and relaxation, I telephoned my home. And I heard a lot of moaning and crying. I said, "What's wrong? What's happened?" "Your father died. Today was the funeral." For almost two years, I didn't talk to him. A really sad part of my life, but I did not and that was stupid of me. Absolutely stupid. There's a quote I use. A lot. "Ballast yourself with reality... - then throw yourself into the sea. The sea is inspiration." And so, in acting, because I start off with the reality, then I can go further... because it's alive. It's free. It's like... the sea. The sea of inspiration. I can swim in these waters. And you know, what's wonderful about Wynn is that he has two lives and two legacies. One life is his work as an artistic director of a very distinguished theater, The American Place. The American Place Theatre. A private organization of excellence. Wynn ran what I call a boutique theater. American Place Theatre, for people who cared about theater. Pure theater in its purest form. Looking back on it, it was the most exciting theater of its day. A place where you could experiment. Wynn was doing experimental plays. He was doing plays with new authors. The American Place Theatre always took chances. It's a safe haven where you can fail. It was okay. You could afford to fail... And then fail again. ...which allowed some wonderful things to happen. The head of the theater is kind of a curator. His taste, his curatorial vision, was always paramount. He had the ability to spot talent. All these people who got their start at The American Place, playwrights, actors... They were first-rate, wonderful actors. Some of them became big stars. I know this was true for all the shows he brought in there. He always wanted to see them. He loved them. He loved the people who were performing. And that says a lot about any artistic director. He was there for you. Very sensitive... very strong and a clear visionary. I mean, he was idealistic. But the key thing Is that on any given night when I was performing at The American Place Theatre, Wynn was somewhere in the building. 423 West 46th Street St. St. Clement's Church. You really felt the sacredness of the stage, you felt the sense of community. You just felt like you were part of something happening. The episcopal church, I don't think... converted as many people as Wynn and The American Place. They were recognized by the city of New York to give them a beautiful new theater in a wonderful location. One block away from Broadway. It was almost Broadway. It wasn't underground theater. It was theater underground, literally. You often forget when you're in that space how far beneath the ground you are. Forty-two feet deep. If there happened to be a nuclear attack while you were on... people from the big Broadway shows would be incinerated. And your audience wouldn't even know about it. I liked that part of it. Wynn was looking for new theater. - He was doing plays that were-- - ...truly original, experimental, cutting edge. He blazed paths before others. You know, you hear the word "pioneered." The commitment that Wynn showed to African-American theater artists. Such a diverse range of playwrights. I can't recall any Asian-American play that existed... until Frank Chin came along. I think it was the first time that lesbians were portrayed just as normal, regular people who had been living a sort of regular life. It was groundbreaking. There were all these emerging voices that the critics were shutting down, and he actually bypassed the critics by getting subscribers. You couldn't get a ticket to The American Place Theatre unless you belonged to it. We would often give talks after a performance. These plays that weren't like a normal play. Wynn was such a pioneer with the post-play discussion. They're so standard now. What did we just see? He had a very specific kind of mission. ...mission of explaining what this kind of theater was. - His mission... - ...which was ...to create a place where new American voices could be heard. To bring writers, like novelists and poets into the theater and see if they could write plays. Nurturing these amazing playwrights. He loved his writers. American voices that now are the fabric of our theater. With The American Place, you never knew what they were gonna do next. Really, didn't know. These were writers that were outside of the mainstream. And being outside of that mainstream... Wynn was looked on as an outcast, you know? Wynn was doing... - what Wynn wished to do. Moving to the beat of his own drum. He never varied in that respect. Okay. Tell me when we can begin. I'm gonna continue where I left off. It's 1946. Sound? What take is this, four? I'd just been hoping I'd lived through the war, and I did. - This is Wynn 61A, tape four. And now what am I gonna do? I have no skills. I'm not that good at anything. I was an English major. I don't know what I'm gonna do with that. I'm not eager to do anything. I have no hobbies. I began to think and I said, "Well, one of my cousins was Lou Handman." Songwriter. He wrote some hits. ? My sweetie went away But she didn't say when ♪ - ♪ She didn't say when ♪ - He had one hit in 1922, the year I was born. ? Are you lonesome tonight ♪ It later was a platinum record for Elvis Presley. - I always had my little band. I had a five-piece band. Each summer... in the Catskill Mountains, I'd play tenor sax, enjoying myself, having fun with girlfriends and stuff. When I was on the Storis, I started to learn the records - of Dwight Fiske's monologues. I would do them for my shipmates. - "And out stepped Mr. Pettibone, just as naked as a child, and twice as cocky." People responded. - I got attention and laughs. I liked that. Maybe I ought to try acting. Maybe I could do this. So it occurred to me that I have four years of the GI bill. The GI bill paid for your schooling. Why shouldn't I take advantage of it? Plunge right in and learn to be an actor. So I called up The Neighborhood Playhouse. I hear that's the best school. When I got there, I had to fill out these forms. There was a lot of stuff on there I didn't know anything about. It said professional references. I put my brother-in-law, a dentist. Then it said dance training. And that was big. I put usual ballroom steps. Because I had taken some lessons at Arthur Murray. Arthur Murray taught me dancing in a hurry. Fortunately, they had me interviewed by Sanford Meisner. I improvised a lot as a jazz musician. And that word seemed good to him. Improvise. I really felt good with him. And I spontaneously said, "You know, I really want to get into this school." He said, "I wouldn't worry about it, if I were you." And I discovered... he wanted to take untutored people. Untutored. He tended not to take tutored people because tutored people meant bad habits and a whole misconception. And he didn't want to bother breaking that down to get to the real thing. But he was a brilliant teacher. Sandy was brilliant. He was just brilliant. If you could take it. Sandy taught by kind of hypnotizing you. You had the feeling with Sandy, always, that he had a great big microscope and was looking into your brain. And you were always a little uncomfortable that he knew more about yourself than you did. And so there was something intimidating about it. Everybody was afraid of him. Everybody was terrified of Sandy. We were always petrified. For better and worse. Sandy got emotion from you by scaring the shit out of you. Then you'd... sometimes surprise yourself with what you did. I had never felt so right about being at a place and what was going on. I could swim in those waters. And inside of two weeks, Sandy, who was very perceptive, picked it up. He would say, "Look, you work with her" or "You work with him." Because I immediately grasped what he was getting at. He treated me like... a student assistant. Because he was really grooming me, I think... to come back and be his assistant. He said... "You will go through an apprenticeship of humility." And I did. Sydney Pollack was an acting student at The Neighborhood Playhouse when I was assisting Sandy. I was 17 years old when I went to The Playhouse. The week's work would be usually three sessions during the week with Sandy and four or five sessions during the week with Wynn. The first time I met Wynn was at The Neighborhood Playhouse, where I was a student. He was Sandy's assistant. And Wynn was reasonable and rational, charming and friendly. He was the one you didn't have to be afraid of. I was never petrified when I was working with Wynn. I mean, Wynn was enormously successful in relaxing people, because they trusted him. A kind of a super gentle way of teaching that was a marvelous blend with Sandy. I always thought they were a sensational team. But they were 180 degrees opposite in their styles. It was the same... stuff as Sandy's, but a slightly different attitudinal approach to it. Working with Wynn was like Sandy, plus... a... value to the human being. When I was with Sandy, he didn't do these repetition exercises. Which were, "Well, what do you think of this?" "I don't think of that." "I do that." "Well, fuck you." And a back and forth repetition. They do that for a whole semester. Over and over and over again. That's Meisner. Repetition... Your hair is shiny. Your hair is shiny. Set in with Sandy. Because the more and more stressed, - live off the other person. - You have warm eyes. - You have warm eyes. - You have warm eyes. - Even a sign was up. "One ounce of behavior... is worth a pound of words." Oh, come on. The greatest roles are in Shakespeare. They're the words. They're not depending on behavior. I had been assisting Sandy for four or five years. Basic acting teaching, which got kind of boring and repetitious. Basic acting, basic acting, basic acting, basic acting, basic acting... I don't know who concluded that I should leave, but I had to leave. It felt like the time has come, and the bird has to leave the nest. - February. 1948. My second year at The Neighborhood Playhouse. I met Bobbie Handman. She really liked poetry. So I hit her with T.S. Eliot: "Through the room the women come and go. Talking of Michelangelo." Things flowed with us. Streams that flowed together. It felt so right that we knew we were gonna get married. There was no proposal. No figuring things out. Somehow a date came along to get married, and we did that. I was... approaching 40 years old. I realize as I look back... there was such a thing as a midlife crisis. - I was starting to... think about The American Place Theatre. I had a name, - but I didn't have a theater. This is in the early '90s, I think. I was making some short films and I had a meeting with Wynn. And I said, - "I don't know anything about actors. I need some help because I'm making these films and I have no idea what they want." And I told him, "Look, I'm a photographer. I don't understand actors at all." So I came to class. I sat in the back for the first month or two. And then I asked Wynn if I could direct a scene. And so he said, "Sure." And because I was a photographer he gave me I Am a Camera. And there's not a lot of action in this scene - and I went to Wynn and I said, "You know there's nothing that's happening in here." He goes, "No, there's a lot there. Just look at it." The deep history of ordinary things, of the overseen, of the overlooked, that's really what interests me. And, I swear, I still remember those words till this day. "There's much more there. Just look at it. There's a lot there." One of the phrases I remember Wynn always saying was, "Let it happen." He would say this over and over. "Let it happen." I was very satisfied teaching and freelance directing all through the '50s, but I also felt there's more I wanted to do, so I decided to get a master's degree in Speech Therapy at Teacher's College, Columbia. On the reading list there was this book. America and Alfred Stieglitz, A Collective Portrait. Alfred Stieglitz was an extremely important man in American art. "I am the moment. And anyone is free to be in the moment with me." Alfred Stieglitz is allowing photography to become its own art form. And saying, "Okay, this is the role of photography in the modern world." You have to realize, in the earlier part of the 20th century, American artists were not given the freedom to create as Americans, and Stieglitz felt that. Around 1917, he started An American Place. Stieglitz saw the gallery, An American Place, as a kind of fusion of work and dream. Something between a laboratory and a church, and a museum, and a library, and a theater. So that name really appealed to me. And the best-known essay in that book... It was a short piece that Gertrude Stein wrote. It begins with these lines: "If anything is done and something is done then somebody--" "Then somebody has to do it. Or somebody has to have done it. That is Stieglitz's way." That is Stieglitz's way. He has done it." When Stieglitz has An American Place, It's like nothing else. There's no other place like it probably in the world. There's something happening here... that's never happened before. And I think Wynn also wanted to make things happen that had never really happened before. - Wynn wanted to create... a place, a space, where things could happen. And he understood that Stieglitz had done something similar. Now, that meant a lot to me as I started to think about what I wanted to do. - I wanted to do something meaningful. In 1961, on the dunes of Fire Island, I began to conceive of a theater which I felt was very needed. A place, I wanted to use that term, "place." Those were long notes, I wrote to myself. Out of that grew The American Place Theatre. Sidney Lanier was an episcopal priest. - He had been experimenting with the arts as part of the church services. I started to go on in my fashion about The American Place Theatre. Well, he said, "You know, I know of an old church on 46th Street. Maybe we can make that into a theater." The whole concept is to get more challenging theater. We're not going to restrict ourselves to plays we think are going to make money. I went to a lawyer and I said, "I'm wondering, is there such a thing as a not-for-profit that you can do in theater, and we'd get the support that way, because we're a worthwhile institution and a temple of the ascent of man." She said, "You can do a not-for-profit, but it takes a lunatic. Are you the lunatic?" I said, "Yes, I'm the lunatic." The Old Glory... was a play to launch The American Place Theatre. The author is Robert Lowell. He's a poet. It just was crazy. This was written in verse. Each play was written in verse. Nothing could have been more important or different than what Wynn did by bringing Robert Lowell into the scene. He didn't do it because it was a statement. He did it because, aesthetically and intellectually, it was stunning work. You had Benito Cereno, which was about a revolt on a slave ship... and two shorter plays based on American history. Huge cast. At least 20 actors who are African-American. All of this would run about four hours. Once you do that, you set a standard for theater that people say, "That should be on." And it doesn't really make any difference if it makes a fortune or not. I just felt, "This is it. I have to open with it." I just had a fixed idea that Frank Langella should play the part of Benito Cereno. Wynn must have asked for me to come in because I'd been a student, and I remember Robert Lowell was there, and Wynn was there. And they gave me a speech and I read it. Robert Lowell turned around, looked at me, and nodded his approval, so I cast Frank Langella. Who was going to direct all this? So Robert Lowell said, "I want Jonathan Miller to direct the play." "Well, has he ever directed?" "No." That's who he wanted, so Jonathan Miller was appointed to do it. Jonathan Miller was the director. Jonathan Miller was English. Jonathan Miller never had a stop-and-go rehearsal. Not one. We had three or four weeks, and it was nothing but run-throughs. One or two a day, and it staged itself. And Jonathan would say, "Well, darling, maybe perhaps you might want to turn there and come back this way." You have to have patience and kind of an empathy with actors to work with them. He had none of that. But I remember Robert Lowell... tearing pages out of the script. Making them into airplanes and... At the American Place, I was in a Robert Lowell piece and Jonathan who directed it. He had Roscoe Lee Browne, and he had Frank Langella already, but he needed all these African-Americans to be slaves. And I was able to get actors for him because I knew... where the actors were, you know? Glory be, Master. Casting directors were not prevalent at that time. Yellow fever, Master Yankee. It was like, "This is a good actor." - And they were. Nothing to eat, Master Yankee. Nothing to drink, Master Yankee. Even now I don't think you understand my position here. - I want to speak to you alone. - I am alone. As much as I ever am. - I played this character, Benito Cereno. He was a Spanish nobleman being held prisoner on-board his ship. Don't you understand? - I am as powerless as you are. - He is as powerless as you are. Don't you understand? He's been holding a knife at my back. I have been talking all day to save your life. Captain! Captain! And I remember asking Robert Lowell what the theme of The Old Glory was. And he said, "It's about all idealism hardening into violence." The lawyer said, "It takes a lunatic." Well, I was a lunatic. I was on fire with it. Maybe too much, because there was a biography of Robert Lowell and it said, "Wynn Handman had a Messiah complex." But I guess I did. My hero, George Bernard Shaw, he wrote: "More people... went to the theater... than went to church. This would be a very good thing if... the theater took itself seriously. As a factory of thought, an armory against despair and dullness, an elucidator of social conscience, and a temple for the ascent of man." The Old Glory was a huge success. That was a big, old church. It was great, you could do anything in there. I think as a lighting designer, I did about twenty-seven different productions. It was a very accommodating stage. But, every Sunday, they still had church services. So no matter what our scenery was up there, on a Saturday night, after a show completed, the crew had to go and get it ready for the next day when they would have church services. One of our problems was, if we wanted to hang something over top that stage, We had to send a guy on a ladder that was something like 60 feet high. We were working with hippies, you know? I mean, we never killed anybody, but we could have. The American Place Theatre was the hope of all of us, because we thought, "Aha, it's in the right neighborhood, and it's not some terrible, dingy, dark rat-infested... you know, 50-seat theater downtown that you can't find." The American Place Theatre was unusual in the sense that... it was uptown but its ethos... straddled both worlds. The downtown people never got past 14th street. "I get a nose bleed when I go above 14th street." They lived in another world. Caffe Cino. Café La Mama. The Living Theatre. Sam Shepard. Wynn was smuggling uptown a lot of the best downtown talent. Sam Shepard had a deep imagination. To me, he was always youth, he was imaginative, and spontaneous. And it just overflowed from him. I was a writer, you know. I'd just write the stuff and then go out and find the actors to do it, and we'd do it in cafes, backyards, you know, in the opportunity that was available to us. I hadn't done anything above 14th street. Ever. I mean. I felt like The American Place was a legitimate theater. And, you know, it was a big move for me. And it was an odd play but it was very... It was a really weird play. It's called La Turista. It was a very far out, surreal kind of experience. La Turista. Nobody understood that... you know, but, hey, if Wynn said it was good, and he wanted to do it, his board said, "Let's do it." It's an absolutely unique temperament that he has, you know? He'd make a great horse trainer. You see, with Sam in those days, it was never a smooth ride. I said, "You know, I know a young actor I think could play this part." His name is Sam Waterston. He was great for that part because it required a kind of... American stiffness, you know? The arrogant Americans... who don't know it, - but they're gonna disappear. As the society was fragmenting, as life increasingly seemed to have lost its plot, plays and playwriting were finding another surreal way of reflecting a new reality. We were already breaking ground. Shocking people. We did a play called Harry, Noon and Night. That was insane. And Dustin Hoffman was a transvestite. - A mysterious, creepy... - ...insane character. And I just keep remembering the-- You have to hold for sound, I'm sorry. - We have a helicopter, possibly. A good one? - Ronald Ribman sent a play - called Harry, Noon and Night. It was unlike anything anyone had ever seen. That was what Wynn was looking for, I think. Plays that made the audience say, "What is this?" You know, "Something new is being presented to me here." I remember there was a lot of talk at the time in the church, "Well, do you think this is an appropriate play for a church?" Not a doubt in his mind, "No, no, this is perfectly fine." Nothing stopped Wynn Handman from doing anything that he wanted to do. - They came to the theater... for the shock of the new. I'm of the generation that came of age during all that turbulent experimentation. Wynn would use that phrase, "Let these plays happen to you." And it often triggered my remembering, you know, from... junior high school. "A poem should not mean, but be." Which is a useful phrase for an artist. Don't try to make it mean something. Try to make it be something. You know I remember seeing La Turista, which caused a bit of a stir, because Sam insisted that a chicken be decapitated on stage. One of the sequences, they bring sort of ritualistic doctor in. What did they call them? A medicine man. This doctor is going to use fresh chicken blood and he's going to kill a chicken on stage. - And then he would squeeze... - ...the chicken blood, and drip the blood of the chicken - all over Sam... - ...Waterston. It occurred to me that... this is probably going farther than you can go, to kill a chicken on stage. Some guys in suits came in. They were lawyers and they said, "It's illegal to kill an animal... ...on stage for entertainment." As soon as they heard it was illegal, the property guys came up with a wonderful way of doing it. A fake chicken with a syringe in its backside. And it had the illusion that they had to kill that one chicken. And that solved the problem. So much so that the audience believed it and I got a lot of hate mail. Yeah. It was a disaster for Wynn, I think, you know? But, I mean, I'm glad we did it. Many voiced their discontent, and we lost subscribers. A lot of subscribers. American Place Theatre did not have a box office. This was probably the only theater in the world where you couldn't buy a ticket. The American Place Theatre would have a subscription audience, who would be willing to go to see things... before the critics said "yea" or "nay." With subscription-only, you were... guaranteed an audience, without worrying about reviews. If you worry about reviews, then you're worried about the wrong thing. Artistic director of The American Place Theatre, Wynn Handman, and playwright, Ronald Milner. Ron Milner did not change his plays to suit... the audience at the American Place. And Wynn loved that. Wynn was actually looking for African-American plays. I had so many. I had a trove of them. Now, Woody King brought me a play called Who's Got His Own. Who's Got His Own was a family play. Set on the eve of the funeral of the father of that family. A family whose father... was a tyrant and he beat his son up. Whose father was a worker in an automobile plant in Detroit. And then, when his son went to see him at the plant, some of the white workers there... They said, "You're shithouse Tim's boy." He said, "What?" "Yeah, you're shithouse Tim. That's what he does, and that's what we call him." Yeah. And they laughed and the other one said, "He cleans them, and he's scared to come out of them." Now, I didn't understand that, Mama. I mean, it didn't sit right with me. It didn't seem to go with all that thunder and power. That... That was too much for him. So he carried that around on the eve of his father's funeral. For this story to be told was amazing, you know? I couldn't believe that they were doing this particular piece of work. There was no white Savior in Who's Got His Own. There was no one that the caucasian audience could really root for. My impression of the critics... they were not taught these playwrights in school. There was no reference point. And so, therefore, it was hard to write about them. These were in-your-face plays that brought the audience to them and didn't let them go until they had experienced something about a people that they ignored. And there weren't many places doing that, especially at that time. To speak your mind is subversive by definition and unsettling by definition, and thought-provoking by definition. Well, look, I even had to find a reason to come back here to the funeral today, do you dig? All of my life, my father can't talk to me, because white faces had choked his tongue out. Mama, he might be out there in that cemetery, but it ain't over. It's still here. Aching, burning. I saw white, middle-aged people just kind of watch an operation unfold before them, and it was a painful experience for them. But I do feel that all of them knew something better, as a result of having seen the play. In the main, the audience reacted, but the critics, who I thought might come to it on another level and see human beings. As I told you before I... underestimated the white audience, and overestimated white critics. Most of the people who write drama criticism are really writing reviews. Why you want the review is to attract customers. So, that's a function of business and advertising. Each time I did a play, I said to the author, "We do not have to have the critics. Because, after all, I had my subscribers. I wasn't catering to a box office." Why have it evaluated from the outside by people who, first of all, aren't writers? I mean, they're journalists, okay. I'm not saying journalism isn't writing. I didn't feel like, for what we were doing, it was necessary to be assessed like that. That wasn't what we were doing it for. Wynn was not in show business. What Wynn was into was developing a theater culture, to take this tower and to try to sustain it. Who's Got His Own turned out to be very significant. Wynn had opened the world up for me. I could give him a play... and work on it not as an actor, but as a producer. That's how I learned to produce. That's how I was able to bring other plays to Wynn, and other writers. - I had taken to Wynn Five on the Black Hand Side. Wynn did that. I had taken Ed Bullins. Wynn produced his short one-acts. - It was a group of short plays. - What was the title of that? The title was The Electronic... - - ...And Others. - Ed Bullins-- - Ed was his favorite writer. He was cultural minister of the Black Panthers. There might be tension between his subscribers. But Wynn was glorying in that. He loved that, man. And I think that's bad for an artist to be following any mass drive. He has to attack all sides, every side. He's an outsider anyway. - The outsider. I was an outsider. I accepted myself as an outsider. I always did. The creative act, you never know where it's going to lead. You're not thinking about who's picking up on it. You do the act for the act itself. George Tabori was a playwright. Every time you were with him... you had his humor, macabre, bizarre humor, which came from his intellect and his insights about life. - George used to keep a record of all my jokes from the time I was eight. He had a little book where he wrote my jokes. Very often, you have to make laughter out of disasters. Because, although his father died in Auschwitz, George became a British subject in order not to end up in a concentration camp himself. - He escaped. He wanted things to be taken seriously, but he did it with humor. I don't know how come he came to me, but... he had already... done something off-Broadway called Brecht on Brecht. Brecht was a brilliant German playwright. When George did Brecht on Brecht at the Theatre De Lys, that was intended to run for eight weeks. There were actors sitting on stools in front of a portrait of Brecht, and that play ran for four years. I was aware that George was quite a scholar on Brecht, but when I read The Cannibals... It was a play set in Auschwitz. You just tell me what this picture is. Yeah, this is a picture of Puffy... who, in the play, is preserved... while the rest of the barracks are starving. The Germans keep giving him food, and food, and food so that they are going to take pictures of the inmates eating pieces of Puffy. A horrible thought. The Cannibals took the position that Auschwitz was a place where prisoners had to perform for their captors. And it's a play in which one of the inmates dies and is eaten by the other inmates. I mean, that doesn't sound so enticing, does it? But what's fascinating about it is the way in which they came to understand each other, the victims and the victimizers. This relationship between the victim and the victimizer, this was what drove George's plays. - If I didn't do the play, then I had a feeling no one was going to do it. I don't know where it would lead, but you don't think about it. Wynn is not an activist. There was a sense of tradition in the experience of The American Place. But simultaneously, he was the angel of deeply intelligent, emerging theater. American Place was like a home. You came in there. You felt like you were part of a family. I used to sit and watch rehearsals, and, I mean, Wynn did not kick me out. You know? It was not like people who weren't working on it should not be there. I was more interested in rehearsals than I was interested in anything else. You know, they started to do all kinds of... I mean, they did tons of improvisation. How we were going to give the actors the... Not just the opportunity, but the right to be all that they could be? I mean, I was very much for what they were doing, giving the actors a lot of freedom, which sort of spilled over to the audience, but I felt the audience got a bit uncomfortable with the way they spilled over. One of the actors jumped up on a table and he said, "Wynn, the theater is not a safe place. The theater is not a safe place." And George Tabori certainly didn't think of it as a safe place. The kind of people who'd go to The American Place Theatre are people that have social values. They're people that care about justice. The fact is that what The American Place Theatre was doing was bringing a lot of extremely interesting ideas about injustice into the theater and making it an experience that people wanted to have. Some people wanted to have, So we did the play, but I remember the reviews did not come near the... value of this piece of theater. But I didn't expect it anymore. Shortly after, I heard from... - the director of the Schiller Theater. Rather famous theater but located in West Berlin. I was rather shocked to hear from somebody in Germany wanting to do The Cannibals. Because I carried around in me such an aversion for the Germans and for what they did. Naturally, I was... conflicted. I had said to myself, "I never want to go to Germany." What were they doing during the war? I don't want to set foot... in that country. This was the question that everybody had. If they went to Germany, who were they, and what role do they play? Nazis. - And now I have to fly on Lufthansa? I made the decision to go. I went to Germany, of course. I thought this was going to be a catastrophe. What is George doing back in Germany? I mean, Germany? Germany killed his Dad, you know? I may just not stick around for this opening. Tomatoes were definitely being thrown that night. This was not going to be a good experience. And I thought, "No, I'm not gonna watch that." Wynn, of course, had no such concerns. He was right smack there. We came to the opening, and George was very nervous. He was just pacing back and forth. So, when the performance started, George was pacing in the back of the theater. He wasn't watching. - I sat in the fourth row... and I watched the play. I knew the play. And the actors were damn good. I was sitting next to Ushi, the translator, a young woman. She found humor in it. She laughed. And the older man sitting near me was furious at her for laughing. He said, "You silly cow. This is not a laughing matter." The son of the camp commander came down to the forestage. This was the finale of the play. And he started asking, "Daddy, what did you do in the war? Daddy, what did you do in the war?" The actor, he whipped his body around. He was using his body as a whip with each question. "Daddy, what did you do in the war?" In front of me, were these beautifully coiffed German women. "Daddy, give me an answer. What did you do in the war?" And with each "what did you do," these women in front of me started to recoil, as if they were being whipped, which they were. "Don't give me this philosophical bullshit, Daddy. What did you do in the war? What did you do in the war?" The play ended. There was a silence. The actors came out one by one, - but with each actor coming out, there was increased applause. The opening night of a new play, - the playwright got up on the stage... and George bowed. And the applause went on and on and on. Cannibals wasn't a big hit in New York... but in Berlin... you know, the roof came off. It was huge. It opened the door for Auschwitz. For the announcing of all these things that happened, opened the door. And then the miracle happened. And that's the miracle of Tabori. It is the greatest success we have ever had. The Cannibals became a nationwide hit. Well, they did it in Dusseldorf, and they did it in Stuttgart. We had no anticipation whatsoever of the deep and profound guilt in the German culture. That was a part of what made that play so phenomenally successful. - And not only that, George Tabori became a nationwide hero of the theater. So much so, he stayed on in Germany, because he became the guru of theater in Germany. He became a superstar in Germany. The Theatre of the Holocaust was subsequently defined by George. Success was not what Wynn was after. He wanted to bring great ideas to an audience. He wanted to affect a generation. And he did that with George. - The creative act... you never know where it's going to lead. I've been very lucky... my whole life. The first 12 years of The American Place Theatre's life, - I had generous funding from the Ford foundation and the Rockefeller Foundation. I was free of the real burdens of fundraising. That was a time when the the city was trying to preserve live theater. And, at that time, the city got me involved. They'd say, "Go to see Larry Fisher. Fisher Brothers. They're big builders of office buildings." I go to see Larry Fisher. Larry Fisher said, "I'm going to build you a theater, five dollars a year, okay?" Well, how do you turn this down? At no cost to you, you can design the theater underground at 46th Street and 6th Avenue. You pay five dollars a year rent. Well, this was very hard to resist. It made a lot of sense. The new theater opened in 1971. Wynn Handman... His theater was not a large theater, but it was an important theater. And Wynn had room for playwrights to come in and develop their work. It was always the playwright, the playwright. A playwright may sit alone writing, but desperately needs to hear people say words. And until the playwright hears those words said, they don't really know what they've written. A script came across my desk called The Chickencoop Chinaman's Pregnant Pause. The play needed quite a bit of work. It was like pretty fat, like the phone book. - Queens' phone book. The manuscript to the first Chickencoop Chinaman was that thick, literally. That thick. Wynn Handman calls me up. I don't know who the hell Wynn Handman is. I had a feeling we got a call from a Chicago used car salesman. But what comes through is, "Oh, I can go to New York! I've never been to New York." It was an adventure. Then I brought Frank Chin here from California. And to him it was a big deal to be in the Apple. And then I saw the new theater. This theater was in the basement, but it was... beautiful. It was so intelligently laid out. I didn't know what to think. I mean, this is... for me? Wynn Handman says, "You know, there's a Shakespearean actor that's making quite a stir, and he's a terrific actor." "Okay, bring him in." It's Randy Kim. Goddamn! Where did this guy come from? I would never be cast in, say, an Arthur Miller play or a Tennessee Williams play, whereas, the classical playwrights, they will open doors to me. I could do a Greek tragedy. I could do Shakespeare. And here was this Asian-American playwright. I don't know, I found the courage to say, "Okay, maybe I can do something in this." There was-- The confusion of that period I wanted to work out. I wanted to find out... what was an American of Chinese descent? One of the most telling monologues in the Chickencoop Chinaman... - the protagonist, played by Randall Duk Kim... on the radio... had heard these stories about the Lone Ranger. And the Lone Ranger had a black mask, and you never saw his face. So, this kid was listening on the radio to The Lone Ranger. He was convinced that the Lone Ranger was Chinese. "I have a share in your national myths. The Lone Ranger came to me over the radio. I didn't go to the Lone Ranger. That fucking Lone Ranger came to me. Man, he makes sense to me. He was Chinese! He wore that red shirt for good luck. He wore that mask to hide his Chinese eyes." One thing that was significant is you could not find another play by a Chinese-American writer. He's absolutely one of those rare producers who is devoted to new writing-- You know, he's totally devoted to new writing and the way it's connected to the actor. Wynn Handman created a space. It was like a sanctuary, a place that you felt at home, you would go to, and you'd roll up your sleeves, and you'd say, "Okay, let's get to work." He's a master. Master of his craft. He'll help you get your craft, and it's up to you to make it art. - Julia Miles was... - The managing director of the theater. Quiet, smart, a very charming person. Great at managing the money that they had and figuring out how to make the place go. She was someone I related to everyday, and had a high regard for her intelligence, her abilities, and her really feeling what The American Place Theatre was about. She moved up, and then we had created the title of Associate Director. We had the same mission. When plays came along that I was considering, I had her read them, and she and I would discuss them. It was nice to have someone that close as your colleague, feeling the same things and wanting the same things. She was family. It's hard to realize how masculine the world of the theater was in the early '70s. It was the culture we lived in. And so it was important for the health of the place to have a very strong, intelligent... and fierce female presence. Well, just at this time, and maybe a little earlier, Julia Miles was saying, "You know, we don't get enough scripts from women." I said, "Come on, we've-- I've done women... Anne Sexton, Rochelle Owens, María Irene Fornés." She said, "No, I'm talking about the fact that we don't get submissions from women who are writing plays." I said, "Why not?" She said, "They don't send them." I said, "Well, you know, Julia, I just heard about a woman who is working for the Ford Foundation to determine if women are getting fairly treated in the theater." A report was published that said that some ludicrous number of plays... - Two percent. Something like that. - ...produced, two or five percent Of the plays produced in the United States, anywhere... were produced by women. Julia was shocked by this report. So I called the Ford Foundation and when I spoke to Gail Counts, I said, "Come and meet us. Julia Miles has been talking quite a bit about women in the theater and what she might do for it." Developing women as directors and women as dramaturgs, as other parts, functioning parts, of doing new plays. Gail Counts came through. She found what she was looking for. She was looking for someone who was going to do something about elevating the state of women in the theater. And scripts came in the hundreds. I was amazed. Julia said, "You see?" I said, "Julia, you were right." I remember the first day of the women's project very well. We all went into the rehearsal room, and it was a day of celebration, and joy, and pride. The very first reading of the women's project... Cay directed, and it was a one-act play written by Sybille Pearson. And I remember we all were given a rose, even the few men who were there, to hold just as a symbol of... something beautiful, I guess. I forgot that! - Was that the first reading? Oh, my gosh! - The very first reading of the very first year. But that day was... Speeches were made, and you know, they were glowing idealistic, visions of utopia speeches. That's what I remember. I remember being very moved by it. The women's project was beginning to outgrow being some sub-project of The American Place Theatre. I think it was necessary for them to separate from the American Place, to no longer be under the umbrella of a larger theater, and to, eventually, find their own space. They got a large grant. And it enabled the Women's Project to now be independently the Women's Project. They bought a theater, became very much a theater of its own. Julia had her own ambitions as a producer. She was going to be able to have more independence and voice in selecting the work that she wanted to do, and getting it onstage without being beholden to The American Place Theatre. Wynn's theater, structured as it was for the common denominator of playwrights from everywhere, who didn't just come from privileged places, meant that it was a democratic institution, perhaps run autocratically by producer-director, Wynn Handman. He set the rules, but he did so for a group of people who were the disenfranchised. I was very proud of it, pleased that it grew, and feel that it was a very worthwhile outgrowth of work from The American Place Theatre. American theater has had to adapt and change. We're still about inventing democracy, which is many voices, many opposing voices, and the playwrights represent opposing voices. Storytelling is the central point. - We need stories. We humans. - Just hold for a second-- - Sure. What did I do? - Oh, nothing. Right. - No. He's letting this siren pass. - Just a siren we wanna let pass. - Siren? God. - We'll ask this last question again and-- - Sirens are okay in movies, aren't they? When it's danger and emergency? - My daughters... were literally raised in Midtown, Manhattan. I was teaching and I had The American Place Theatre. My schedule was pretty full. Well, we always had dinner together. We had a topless bar across the street. An erotic film house around the corner. That was our neighborhood. It was still pretty... um... sexy, shall we say. It was different growing up a Handman. Very rarely did we spend time in the studio, but there were actors here, and there were actors who were doing things in lieu of tuition. Like James Caan was our handyman, Joanne Woodward, Sydney Pollack were babysitters. My babysitter was Brad Davis. Dad didn't used to be a worrier. He never worried about anything, and it was always, you know, running on the tarmac to catch the plane, and you know... - And money, never worried about. - Money, never ever. It was only money. And I do remember when the new theater was being built. You were big time. It was like you had a really established theater with a real box-office. A subscription theater was not a common thing. It was sort of a novelty when it was in St. Clements and earlier. But it it kind of lost steam in the '70s. Dad had to do fundraising, which was really against his nature. I mean, he's an artist, and here he was having to ask people for money, which he despised. So there was a lot of... you know, angst about wanting to do great work and having the audience to see it. So I did feel that at every dinner, pretty much. Well when you're running a theater, a not-for-profit theater, funding is always a concern. By this time, funding was a major consideration. I used to walk to my theater every day. And I'd say the same thing. - It was a quote from Shakespeare, Richard II. When things were tumbling down on him. And he says, "No deeper wrinkles yet?" You're still trying to figure out... who you are. Who are you? My name's Walter Hawks. Is that me? What's wonderful about Wynn is that he has two lives. Is that me standing up there? Yeah, think it is. Let's find out who you are and how you work. My mother thought I should be a businessman, but I was not cut out for it. There are people in life who open doors. You won't believe this, but when I got up to the Coast Guard Academy, we were in alphabetical order in the barracks. We were "Hs" in that room. So, it was Handman... and Walter Hawks. H-A-W. But Hawks, he never showed up. But for some reason, when they took the roll call, he'd say, "Hawks?" I'd say, "Present." And I just started to answer for Hawks. Later on, when I was now an officer and on the ship, and we go into a port, I just would say, "My name is Walter Hawks." I would go under the name of Walter Hawks. I don't know why. Maybe I started to think about character then. Everything grows from life. When we're acting... we are bringing characters to life. Most of the actors are much better when they have a character. That's what my aim is, to get them into it. To use a phrase I got from Eric Bogosian... when he was doing his monologues at my theater. One night, I dropped around, and I saw him in a character that he had been doing. But it's like I saw the character really for the first time. So when I went backstage, I said, "Eric, you really have it now." He said, "Yeah, I'm really inhabiting it now." That phrase stuck with me. I use it in my teaching. That's my aim, is to get my actors to inhabit the character, to live in them. When it's alive, when it exists for the actor, it exists for the audience. You're under the character's skin... to inhabit. - But I got that phrase from Eric. We're ready to roll. I'm sort of sitting forward a little bit as you can see... I was a character actor from the time I hit the stage when I was 16 years old. And I was into pretending and making believe I was somebody else and doing it as forcefully as I could. As a student in the fall of 1975, - I was going to theater, I don't know, every other night. So I was looking for shows that had things going on that were really on. But of all the shows that I saw, the one that would have the biggest effect on me was this short piece at The American Place Theatre. The American Place Theatre presented Sam Shepard before most people had heard of Sam Shepard. I had heard about Sam Shepard. Sam wrote monologues. And Sam sent me this eight-minute monologue. Was it eight minutes? I don't know. About 30, 40 pages of monologue. Well, it was very intense. As I look back on it, he knew that I'd do anything he wanted. And he played on that. So I say, "Okay." When I saw that there was something going on at The American Place Theatre, I went over there to see what it was. And what it was, was Richard Gere in Killer's Head. I remember seeing KIller's Head there, Richard Gere. I was strapped into electric chair with a blindfold. It was so much in this character's head, literally, it's called Killer's Head. It was inside of his head. You get bits and pieces. Sometimes, it was garbled, the same as thoughts are garbled. ...today's the day I buy the pick up. Should pull the horses all right. 'Course... 60 miles round trip. Just to take that mare up and get her bred. This killer, he's going to die. They're gonna kill him. Surely he's thinking about his crime. And all the dialogue had to do with was whether the truck would take the horses. And all these things that had nothing to do with crime, punishment, or anything. These were all in the killer's head, the horses and the trucks. And going up and down - the California Highway. Ain't worth it in the long run. Only makin' that haul once a season. Just to hit that fair circuit. Couple a' auctions, maybe. So there were a couple of things going on. One, Gere was like practically popping out of his seat when he was doing the role. It's a full eight hours no matter how ya' cut it. Specially with a double rig. Full days ride But more importantly, it was a monologue. A lot of Sam's work is just monologues. - Yeah. - It wasn't just a monologue, it was a monologue that had this... kind of dream-like quality to it. And it just made perfect sense to me. And the energy was through the roof. And then finally there's this blinding flash of light, - and he's electrocuted. The play is over. It was astonishing. What I didn't know was what a huge effect Killer's Head would have on my work. And I didn't know about Wynn Handman at that point. I just had gone to a theater, and there was this piece. But actually... Am I running on here? Wynn would have an effect on me before I met Wynn, because he produced Regard of Flight with Bill Irwin in 1982. The Regard of Flight. - I think the phrase came to me in a dream. This makes me think of a misspent youth. I thought of The American Place as... "Oh, that'd be a good place to do a show." In 1981, Wynn was still in after excitement over this production they'd done of Der Fuehrer Bunker. If he gets excited about Hitler, maybe he'll have a place in his heart for clowns. Now, is this new theater? I'm sorry. Well, what we're seeing here this evening is new theater. Is that right? Ah, yes, it is, it's new. We were trying without entirely knowing what we were doing. We were trying to create a piece that both was a piece of new theater. And there's this non-linear capturing a dream-like feeling. But at the same time was kind of... A chase. Taking flight from a critic. So there were a couple of things going on here. One, Bill really broke out with that show. But even more importantly, Bill was working in solo but saying, "This is a piece. It all fits together." It definitely made me think something about... I don't know, solos can go somewhere. - ...and I loved being in his office. It was very funny 'cause he's showing me all of these pictures, you know, "You can keep this, you read this when you get a chance," you know. It was interesting being there. It was great being there. Taking the work to the next level. I didn't want to be known as a downtown performance artist. I just wanted to be a theater person. People like Wynn... helped give me the courage to look at the beautiful stuff and the ugly stuff, and invent and reinvent. Because I'm really interested in dark, dark work, that's the thing. And so he was one of the few that didn't shy away from it. First, Beauty's Daughter. It went from character to character interspersed with poems, but it's still theater. It's a play. It's a play for one person doing different roles. He wasn't even thinking about it in terms of it being a one-person play. He was just thinking theater. I had hit a point of stasis in my career, but I was working on a show. Now, the name of the production was Drinking in America. Now, Drinking in America... Each character, there are about 12... So in the fall of '85, I went and saw Wynn. What's interesting with Eric is that... he started doing these monologues because he saw a Sam Shepard monologue called Killer's Head, which was done by Richard Gere. Maybe he just thought, "I don't know... I can do something with this kid." And Wynn said... I said, "Well, let's work on it." "I can take you further with this character work." Ballast yourself with reality. Actors must find ballast to go about what they're doing. And they need something to lock onto to be better. Wynn loves the process of character creation. What I teach is it's coming out of what's existing inside of you. As you discover, as you really live it. And if it exists for you, it will exist for the audience. And he helped me understand how to dig deeper and ground those characters. And that showed up in Drinking in America. So that's what happened with me and Wynn. That's how I ended up at American Place, in 1986, when we did Drinking in America at The American Place Theatre. Truckin' with the do-dah man. Grateful Dead music playing on the stereo. We're blowing these J's, man. We're getting completely like fucked out of our minds, right? And then the 'ludes kick in, right? Hey man, take your hand off my girlfriend's leg. Fuck you! No man, fuck you! No man, fuck you! I was into all this intense physicality on stage. Hitting and flailing. I actually can't do it right now or the mic will get torn off of me. I don't know what I could've been doing, but I was throwing myself forward or something. But I didn't realize I had hurt myself. Anyway, I look down, and there's these red spots all over the place. That looks like blood. Am I bleeding? So I ran off to the wings where Rebecca Green our stage manager was. She says, "You're bleeding. You're really bleeding a lot. We have to do something right now." And she called Wynn and he came down. And he just whisked me out the door to Roosevelt Hospital. I took eight stitches. Wynn is really worried about me and as I'm being stitched up I said, "Wynn... have we told the audience that I'm not coming back?" - I came to New York in '91. And... um... I had heard of this... So I started working. Okay, wait, hold on, back up. - I was walking down 46th Street, - two weeks after I got to New York City. And I see these two giants, Sam Shepard and John Malkovich come out of this theater. The American Place Theatre. And I remember that feeling of like, "This must be where really great actors work." Cut to a few months later. I started working for this woman who would sell cookies and brownies during intermission at this theater that I had seen John Malkovich and Sam Shepard come out of. Cut to this guy walks into the lobby of the theater. Crotchety, distempered, irritated with everything. And I thought, "Who's that old cranky guy?" She said, "Oh, that's the guy that runs this theater. - That's Wynn Handman." She said, "He has an acting class." "Oh, my God, it'd be so amazing to be in his acting class." "No, don't even bother. It's very high caliber. It's really for very professional actors." Cut to the girl I was dating at the time. She goes, "Guess what? I'm auditioning for this acting teacher, who's supposed to be one of the greatest acting teachers in New York City." And I was like, "Oh my God! Wait, that's Wynn Handman. I was told you can't get in his class." She said, "Well, I'm auditioning for it." - So I said, "I'm gonna audition for it." You know, obviously he came from Meisner and all of that. A lot of his technique had to do with finding character, building character. So that you could play that character in any scene, in that play. And you could even play that character outside of that play. He would do something called the character interview, where he would talk to you in character and he would interview you and you would speak to him... Kind of what I'm doing right now. You were finding it within yourself, you know, in a way you were finding where the character lived in you, you know, and there was no wrong way to do it, except if you didn't believe it. The first thing you have to be is truthful. Because he could just tell when you weren't. Wynn, above and beyond everything, wanted us to tell the truth in the work that we were doing. Part of that truth came from knowing ourselves and knowing what we had to offer to the character that we were playing. It had to be truthful, it had to be honest, and it had to come from what your truth was. Having the vulnerability enough to... just be simple and and truthful. That was such a big deal at the time. Because I now knew about, like, Bogosian and, like, Leguizamo, and all these people that had studied with him, and I said, "You know, I also have a solo show that I'm working on and I know that you were..." I think, probably at one time or another, every single person in class was working on their one-person show. That John Leguizamo had success there was like a legendary... You felt like, "That could be me." I wasn't interested in working with other actors or doing scene study. I wanted to create a one-man show. And, somehow, I believed that Wynn was going to be sort of the catalyst and the person who could help me make that happen. And in Wynn's class, I was able to put it together as a show, like a whole. He really believed in me and I felt that, and that was the impetus that kept me going till it became a solidified show, you know? People, Aasif Mandvi in particular, would bring these characters in and he'd work on them. You know, at the time-- You have to remember there was no monologue that I could do in class or anywhere, in audition or anything, that was actually a person of my heritage. Here I am, with no real monologue that spoke about anything of my experience, of my American experience. There was nothing, so I wrote this play. One of the first real triumphs I felt of any of my classmates was Aasif Mandvi got to do his one-man show at the American Place. - Nobody wanted to do my play. He was the one that took a chance on this show. And he believed in me. And I think that was the biggest thing. He believed in me. I was aware that the American Place Theatre hadn't had a hit in a long time. And so... I was excited that... Wynn had a hit show on his hands, you know? I also knew that the money wasn't there. My mother thought I should be a businessman but I was not cut out for it. I stayed away from all that stuff. I can understand why, you know, Wynn would not be really into... going to fundraisers and would rather be hanging around the theater, and watching the creative process unfold. That's the excitement about making live theater. He fully lives that. He puts everything on the line for it. And not too many people do that. They talk it. They'll, you know, but... he's fully about theater. Everything is about art for him. That kind of excitement about the art and wanting to be part of the art is very different than the kind of person who's organizationally acute, wants to be going to benefit dinners all the time, wants to be meeting with rich people and asking them for money. And, sometimes, these two things don't fit together at all. I wouldn't call Wynn Handman a lunatic. I would call Wynn Handman a true believer. And that belief, I know, has poured into his students over the years, because I've met a lot of his students, and they really believe in the theater that he believes in. Life changing, significant theater. Everything changed at the American Place for me. So... I wouldn't call him a lunatic. More like a, yeah, a true believer. When a theater closes, a civilization shuts down. Vanished are all the characters who appeared on stage. The audience, too, is gone. A few months ago, The American Place Theatre had to leave its longtime location. A civilization existed and flourished on West 46th Street. It had a rich and various population, and a million scenes, which are now memories. So we bow our heads. They say that life is short and art is long. Sometimes, not long enough. And we have a program, which is called Literature to Life, where we design the plays for young students like yourself. Well, I enjoyed every moment of it because... I mean, if I have a calling, this is what it is. Calling became a meaningful word to me. It's lucky that there are... talented people around like you all to... work with me, and I work with you. Thank you. "We only die if we don't live on in others." I got that quote from Leon Trotsky, famous communist. "We only die if we don't live on in others." All right. - I think he got what he wanted... and is getting what he wants today. - He never... - betrayed himself. He did it his way, and it was unique. You start something when you're a young man. You know, year after year, you get older, and things change within you. Nothing lasts forever. I mean, we're talking about decades. You know, Wynn's legacy is strong without necessarily being strongly named. His accomplishment is permanent. I'm not sure there's going to be the Wynn Handman this or the Wynn Handman that, except in people's minds and hearts. - He's one of the greats. It's like this Mount Rushmore of theater and he's one of the carved heads. I think that pleased him a great deal. To afford people the right - to be seen and heard. Wynn was really creating a place for artists, you know, a home. For artists of any color, any religion. It was just a home for artists. The young writers and young actors, and it wasn't about money. It was about giving everybody a chance. I think he gave them a trust of their own instincts. I think that he gave them an attitude towards the world. The notion that theater is part of an ethos of how you approach the world. He gave me a kind of confidence to trust my own feelings. And when you're an artist, there's nothing greater than that. What he cared about was storytelling that made you, and then hopefully the world, better. Showed you something you hadn't seen with kindness, with openness. That's one of the best things theater can do, - - and that was his dedication. Where does one find a more gentle man? - Wynn is a profoundly committed teacher. He is, without question, the most important teacher of my life. He really loves his students and the gift they have to give. It felt like he was giving us a gift. It's not about him. It's what he's able to bring out in others. He ran his class that way. He ran his theater that way. I carry with me really as tools, every day, in my work so much of what I learned from him. I was really lucky... to find him. To say that it was lucky is not sufficient. He is a part of who I am and what I do everyday. The fact that I was able to do whatever I was able to do in the theater is down to Wynn. He's been such a rock and such a mentor. I can't even sum up the emotions of what it meant to be believed in, when you quite weren't sure if you could believe in yourself. It was a lifeline for me. I was searching. I could see no possibilities. The American theater was beyond my reach. Wynn Handman brought it closer. I never thought he was crazy. I always thought that what he wanted to do was great. You could have a theater the way you wanted it, if you could have the playwrights and the actors that you wanted. And he gave them a stage. He gave them a place. Creating a place where real theater pieces are developed, that can help us to see life a little differently than we do. You could approach it from that point of view, not from, "Is this going to succeed? Is it going to fail?" A model. - - A model for the future. Because such places are needed. This was a good thing to do with your life. You popped up in a dream of mine last week, actually. And you were like, "Come back to class." It might be-- It might be almost time, but it's so good to see you and to see you in such good spirits. - I am in good spirits. - You are. I won't keep you. I'll let everyone see you... - Well, you're looking good. - Thank you. - And I'm glad you're employed. - Thank you. Okay, good. ?
