~ Shiawase no Kiiroi Hankachi ~ (The Yellow Handkerchief of Happiness) =2011 Special Edition= (Summer, 2011) Original Direction and Screenplay: Yamada Yoji From the original story "Going Home" by: Pete Hamill Screenplay: Ozaki Masaya (Abashiri Prison, Hokkaido) Music: Ike Yorihiro Directed by: Iwamoto Hitoshi Translation and fine timing: earthcolors Raw provider and retiming: furransu Sonny, you wanna take a dump? Yes... I ate some crabs last night... They're trying to come out now. Oh, dear, I feel bad for you. Just a minute. Bus driver-san, that man wants to take a dump. Can we stop for a while? This is bad... We have 10 minutes til we get to Haboro (Hokkaido). - Please bear with it, alright? - Okay. Can you still hold it in? I dunno... Take deep breaths... c'mon, please... Take deep breaths! Are you alright? Can you still make it? We're arriving soon, okay? Okay... What the hell you're doing?! "Please wait." Ah! There~!! Yoshi! Toi-Toilet? Where's the toilet? Got it. At the end of the left hallway. Ah, e-excuse me! Huh? Hey~!! Wait~!! Hey~!! Bus... hey! Wait for me~!! Heyyy~! Wait up~!! Hey you~!! SH*T~!! I had diarrhea... In order to take a dump, I had to get off the bus... ...Your driver knew that! Then WHY the heck didn't he wait for me? I have a part-time job interview in Wakkanai at 6! I'm already too late for that!! What the heck will I do now?!! Well, since it can't be helped, can I please get my money back? The fare from here up to Wakkanai! Oh, mannn~!! I need to go again! Can you find me another hotel job in Wakkanai...? ...Is there anything else somewhere? Yes, the same conditions. Live-in worker, free meals, no experience required. Yes. The place?... Doesn't matter, as long as it has the terms I wanted... and it's in Wakannai. So you try to look, alright? And call me back right way. Right now? Uh, I'm in Haboro. Oh, they have something called 'Haboro Shrimp Octopus Potstickers' here. At least, the food here sounds yummy, eh? Hmm~! The Sea of Japan! Man, this really sucks... Sh*t~. Oh, what do we have here, eh? Oji-san (Uncle), I was walking around here... ...and saw signs that say 'Haboro Shrimp Octopus Potstickers' before I climbed here... I wonder if they taste any good? Probably. If I could be motivated to buy the products of this town... ...in order to know the taste of shrimp or octopus... ...I need to sample them first, right? - These sure look yummy, eh? - Try it. Really? Thanks. Itadakimasu. I'll be off now. Wonder where that ship's headed to? Yagishiri. Hagashiri?* [*involuntary teeth grinding during sleep] Yagishiri. Ah... you mean that island over there. Why do you think they named it 'Yagishiri?' Maybe it's shaped like a 'yaga no shiri' * huh? [*goat's butt] Places in Hokkaido have interesting names, right? Like that Shakotan... I know it's famous for bosozoku.* (motocycle clubs/gangs) Yagishiri is written in kanji as... 'the burnt butt.' What's his problem? Oh, no... the battery's dead. Gotta find a convenience store. Store? Where the heck is it? Convenience store. Oh, man~! There's none at all! Oh, man~... There's none... none none none. 'Open for business.' [Establishment Sign: 'Ororon'] Yoshi. Excuse me! Hello~. Yoo-hoo! Excuse me. Excuse me for awhile. Ah, what do you know! It's Oji-san! Is it your lunch break? Oh, that's right, my phone's battery is dead, I'd like to charge it here. Is it ok? - I'm not part of the staff here. - You're not? Well, I can't wait anymore. Where is it? Ah... there there. Alright... I made it, I made it. Anyone here? Where's the oba-san (auntie) of this place. - Not an oba-san. - So is it an oji-san? - Not an oji-san. - Then who? I wonder why... The vending machine can't accept the card right now so I can't get you the cigarettes from there. Are these cigarettes from the store okay with you? Thanks. Oh, welcome to our place. Uh, hey hey hey... ...is it alright if I charge my phone here? ...I'd surely appreciate it. - Go ahead. What do you know... this town ain't so bad after all. This is not a non-smoking place, so it's okay to smoke! Oh, I don't smoke. I used to smoke in high school but I got sick because of it so I quit. I wasn't talking to you. So what will it be? Are you asking me? I'm asking you for your order. Oh... that one. Same with Oji-san. Curry rice. Okay. Yep, hello! I'm sorry, my phone's battery died. So how was it? Oh... I see. So... if something comes up, please call me. Yes, thanks for taking care of it! Seems around these parts there's no available part-time work right now. Until 2 days ago, I was working at a hotel in Otaru (Hokkaido). I'm a 'rizoba.' Rizoba? Yeah, in Tokyo, a rizoba is short for 'resort-baito' [part-time hotel worker]. But the hotel manager there is an assh*le. He jerks me around just because he's a little taller than me. Nah... that big guy's not worth mentioning anyway. Well, you know what they say, 'In the entire body of a big man, wisdom does not circulate.' In the end, even if quitting is quite risky... ...there are still lots of part-time work around. But you see... ...I ate some crabs last night to cheer myself up. Guess I ran out of luck though... Because, y'know, on the way to my job interview, I had to get off the bus to take a dump. Sorry... okay? Now... Now's not a good time to tell that story... So sorry, so sorry. I'm back. You've been to the pachinko parlor again? You left me manning this place alone. Oh, did you miss the boat to Yagishiri? - Yeah. - Oh, so... are you gonna stay here for the night? You guys come out here tonight, it'll be fun. You just wait, I'm gonna get dolled up tonight... I give great service. Stop it, Mom. Go to the back and man the kitchen please. Fine fine. - Nee-san ('Sis'), how much? - Yup, it's 600 yen ($7) Oh, Onee-san... Is there a nice hotel here somewhere where I could go and stay for the night? Just across the river, there's a beautiful hotel there. It's called 'Sunset Plaza.' How much per night? I'm a bit short on cash right now. So then, maybe you'd like to stay in the same pension* as Oji-san's? [*small guest house] - The Oba-san there is really kind. - Really? Hey, hey, hey, Oji-san, Oji-san can I go along with you? I'll eat fast. Here you go... thanks and come again. Oh...that's my grandpa... and the one on the right is my Dad. Hey, wait for me, okay? We're here. Eh? This one? For a 'pension,' this is kinda fancier than I expected. Huh? What happened? You weren't able to go to Yagishiri? - Can I stay here for another night? - Of course, you can. Is there a room for that guy, too? Yes, come on in... It'll be 5,000 yen ($65) per night. 5000 yen? Oh, dang... Can we share a room? That'll be 2000 yen ($26) each for a dorm room. Nii-san ('Bro'), you don't mind, do you? Not at all... thank you so much! - Here, write down your name and address. - Okay. Thank you for your help. I really owe you one! Kindness to travelers can really rub off on you. She's cute, isn't she? 'She?' That girl from the 'Ororon' bar. She's really my type. How about it, Oji-san? There's that older lady there... That mom, y'know? She'd be perfect for you. But she may have a husband, though... ...the girl's dad. Oh, you're going somewhere? - Bathing room. - Me, too... Can I go with you? Oh, let me scrub your back. When I was in a rugby team in college, I was the one who scrubbed the backs of my senpai.* (seniors) Senpai, you got a well-built body, eh? I'm not your senpai. Nope, you're a 'jinsei no senpai.' [*wise, experienced, older person] - Not like that. - Huh? - Squeeze the water out from the towel. - Oh, okay... Is this ok? More. Alright. Scrub using upward strokes... and put more force into it. Here we go... Oh, lotsa dirt coming out... this is like the grime of your life's hard work, so they say. What does Onii-san do? Are you into sales or have a business? - Fisherman. - Oh... fisherman. Are you on a summer break? I'm unemployed right now. You're jobless, just like me. Oh... was it perhaps... ...your boat got washed away during the Tohoku earthquake? Man... that was a difficult time, right? - I also... - Can you please be quiet? Yes, sir. I'm placing your underwear here, alright? - Okay. - Don't sleep in the tub. Oba-chan, you have anything to drink? Oh, you can just choose from there. Beer, 350 yen ($4). Cola,150 yen ($2). The barley tea's free. Hey... should you be dressed like that in front of a lady? Oww! Why? I don't see any lady around here. Just kidding... oww oww... sorry. Good evening.~ Oh... Akemi-chan. Oba-san, Mom says to give you these fish. Yes! Hurry... - Good night. - Thank you. Hey, wait wait.... ...thanks for telling me about this inn! Oji-san had asked me to share a room with him... ...so I get to pay less. - Oh, that's good. - Yeah. - Where's Oji-san? Well, you know, he's already sleeping since old people need to sleep early. - How's your job prospects? Any news? - Nope. Not yet. - Oh... you think it will happen tomorrow? - Well, who knows, huh? It must be nice, isn't it? Having a carefree life. But you're also living a relaxed life in this countryside, aren't you? I'm not taking it easy here... I'm working with my mom, aren't I? Okay... how about your dad? I have none. Divorced, eh? But you know, not having a husband or dad, is better for your business, isn't it? ...So can you be my partner for tonight? - Ours is not that kind of business. Akemi-chan... wait a sec. Can you not freely call me by my first name? Sorry if I was being too direct. I just wanna talk, you know... ...I may have said something unnecessary so you probably misunderstood. Sometimes, you may feel bad over some cheap... Fine, fine... enough already. But you know, even in this lonely town... ...I didn't expect to meet a girl like you. - Say, do you have an email address? - It's in my cellphone. - Huh? How about a boyfriend? - Leave me alone. Say, can we meet from time to time? Aren't you leaving for Wakkanai? It's okay, it's just a short bus ride to Wakkanai. How about it, Akemi-chan? Oww! - Hey... What do you think you're doing? - Why did you have to push me down! Don't come to our diner again. For your information, I'm not that desperate for you, you know! I'm just bored that's why I asked you to be my partner. What the hell... acting all haughty. It's because I'm short, isn't it? But if I'm at your place, how much do I have to pay then? You may be a lil cute, but if you're gonna be so haughty about it... ...it's gonna spoil the mood, won't it? If I go to Tokyo... ...there will be more better women there who will accomodate me and not throw me down! Well, why don't you hurry up and GO BACK to Tokyo then! What're you doing? Shut the f*ck up! You're annoying the neighborhood. Why... is that even possible here? Sorry for raising a ruckus, 'kay? Did Onee-san go back home? It doesn't matter... Man~... guess I have to take a bath once more. She... didn't like you, eh? Yeah, she sure didn't! Anyway, you must be popular with the ladies since you're tall and good-looking. Me? I come from a second-rate university, I have no job... ...no money, no future! There's nothing interesting for me even in Tokyo... ...so I came to Hokkaido and try being a rizoba... But I have no job cuz I got diarrhea and now I just got rejected by a girl... Man! This really sucks! Sit here for a sec. No thanks, I'm fine right here. You sit up straight. Being a man, you see... ...is right here. It's not about having money. But isn't that old-fashioned? When it comes to men and women, there should be the ambiance. 'Ambiance?' What's that? You know, you should prepare the mood... You idiot! Isn't it...? That women are fragile beings? A man should protect them... ...if you can't do that, then no woman would wanna marry you. Be and act more serious! You're like... ...a third-rate baseball player. What does that mean? He never scores. '...Never scores?' 'Never scores...' Oh! I get it! That's so funny, Pops! You're hilarious! Go to sleep!! Yes, sir... Cryin' out loud... ['Sake yo' - 1988 enka song] ~ From now on... you alone understand me, Oh, Sake... ~ ~ You alone understand me, Oh, Sake... ~ Terrible! Hey, you're gettin' prettier, Akemi-chan. Thanks. - Does she have a boyfriend? - Who knows? You know any nice guys around? How about Tadokoro-san? You have a son, don't you? Ken-chan is still single, right? Me, too... I've wondered about that actually. That guy... ...he says he'll quit being a fisherman. - Eh? - He says he's leavin' town. - You can still work, can you? - I can't man the boat by myself! Are you stupid? My fishing business will go bankrupt... Bankrupt, I tell you! - Alright... let's sing one more song. - Go go. Mama-san, duet duet. The two of you? - Damn fool! Bastard! - Stop it! Mom, don't sleep there. C'mon, drink your medicine. It'll be difficult if you get sick. Here. Your Onii-chan called today. So what about it? He said 'Quit that nasty job.' Since he left for Sapporo (capital of Hokkaido), I've been crying and felt so mad at him. He thinks he can act so above us now? Just because he has a baby, and his wife is difficult... ...He wants you now to work there so you can send me money. But you know, I don't really like his wife. Of course, I told him no. I'll find you a nice guy here... You'll always be near your momma, right~? Okay, okay. - Just a lil more... - Watch out. You should stop drinking. - I'll find a nice boy for you, okay? - Fine fine, watch it now... this way. I made these pickles. Wanna try it? Oh, my. Sure is windy today. Welcome home. Hey. Today we had a good catch. Teruyo-san. The ferry trip was cancelled today. - You have some errands in Yagishiri? - Yeah, I'll just delay the delivery for a day. - Can I order some ramen? - Alright. Thanks for the food. Nope. No calls yet. Good mornin'! Oji-san, what're you gonna do today? You're goin back to Hagishiri... No, I mean, Yagishiri? Seems the ferry trip had been cancelled. Really? Got canceled, eh? What to do? Maybe I could go and stop by Sapporo. Look for a job there. Aren't you supposed to go to Yagishiri? No... it's not a big deal. What about you? I'm waiting for a call for a part-time job. Hey, Oji-san! If you like, we could do some sight-seeing around here. They seldom get tourists like us to come here. Sight-seeing, eh? I'll try to ask Akemi-chan. I'll ask her if she can give us a tour. Doesn't she hate you? It's just a petty quarrel. She's sorta playing with me, y'know. It'll be alright. I'll ask her nicely. Oh, Akemi-chan? It's me, Hanata Kinya. Sorry about last night, are you still mad at me? Really? Wow... thanks! Man, you're so kind.~ Well, actually... Oji-san's boat trip got canceled so he's stuck here. I kinda feel sorry for him so I thought I take him traveling somewhere... ... I wonder where we could go? If you'd like, maybe you could be our travel guide. Is this just some excuse to ask me out? "No, you see, Oji-san told me..." " 'Please tell that cute girl to come with us.' " So Oji-san really had asked for it? That's right... I know you might be busy but he told me to ask you nevertheless. Besides, this is your hometown so you know more about it, right? Really? Thanks... we'll be waiting! Akemi-chan! Thanks, okay? - You're not going to Wakkanai? - It's okay, it's okay. Today is a day for sight-seeing. Can I ride in front? Oji-san, get in the back. Oh, just move the box. Sorry to bother you. Is it okay if we go to my favorite spots? Of course, why not? - We're going now! - Take care! Who was that guy? The tall one? Or the short one? - The tall one. - Who knows. But he has money and pays properly so I let him stay. Why do you ask? I've seen him somewhere before but I can't seem to remember... Wow~.. I didn't expect we're gonna have fine weather today. Oji-san, have you been to these parts? Quit calling me 'Oji-san.' I'm actually younger despite my looks. So, what's your name, anyway? Shima Yusaku. 'Shima Yusaku...' 'Shima Yu...' Yusaku-san? It sounds too formal, no? How about 'Yuu-san' for short? - Fine with me. - So we'll call you 'Yuu-san' from now on, ok? Yuu-san? Yuu-san? What a cool car. There's nothing cool about it. These days, we should be using eco-cars, right? Big gas guzzlers like this are only for show... This kind of cowsh*t is suited to some country hick. What the f*ck did ya just say? - Sorry... - You shut the hell up! Hey ya wait! Ya lil squirt... What're you callin cowsh*t, huh? Eh? Ya bastard! If ya wanna say somethin', say it to my face! C'mon, ya bastard! Hey, Onii-san. Whadda ya want, ya bastard?! This guy wants to say he's sorry. Apologize. I'm sorry. There... that should settle it, right? Nii-san. Let's go. You were so cool, Yuu-san. You saved me... For a moment there, I thought something bad will happen. You were so gutsy at first. See? You changed when those two came along. I was just pretending... I was totally calm in front of those country hicks. - Easy for you to say that now. - I wasn't scared at all. Hey, hey, what're those white stuffs? Are those graves? Those are silos. They place them on the grass... so to ferment them and feed them to cattle. I see. So they're not graves then, eh? Wow~ whatta a ranch! This is great! Feels so nice~!! Hey hey, look look look at me! "The Sound of Music!" He's such a kid. I lay down on a pile of cow sh*t! What should I do? What should I do? ...Hey... Ah, sh*t~! What the hell.. I can't get rid of the smell at all. Here, I'm giving this to you. - This is my son's but he doesn't want it anymore. - Really? Thank you so much! This is kinda big, isn't it? My son is this huge. ...he's like a sumo wrestler. - I can tell from the size of it... ...See? But I appreciate it very much. In these parts, all of that side will be covered with snow during winter. And winds will be whooshing in from Siberia. Can you imagine it? I was born in Hokkaido. Such scenery is not unknown to me. I thought so. Somehow I sensed you're not an outsider. Were you born here, too? That's right. Did your grandfather and dad worked in the mines? How did you know? From those pictures in your diner. Oh, that's right. Both of my parents were born in a coal mining town. I see. In the old days, there were several mines here... they employed thousands of people. Now there's hardly anymore. Are they over there? That's right. That mountain over there. This will do... Hey hey! See, I got these pants, I'm safe now. Oh.. sorry for the inconvenience. Thank you so much. Oh, by the way, Oba-chan told me... ...that there are ruins from a coal mining town over on that side. Let's go, I think there might be some interesting ruins over there. - But there's nothing over there. - That's why, it's called 'ruins,' isn't it? Shall we go, Yuu-san? You wanna go, Nee-san? Uh, yeah. Let's go. Yoshi! Alright, let's go. Oba-chan, these pants are really big. - Isn't it because your legs are too short? - No... it's the pants that are big! - So then, thanks, Oba-chan. - Okay. - Thank you, thank you. - Have a safe trip. - Goodbye, Oba-chan. - Okay. Thank youuuu~! Come again~! - That's the old middle school. - I see. That was the elementary school. Woah... amazing. This is interesting. This is interesting, isn't it? This is where my Grandpa used to live. And this is where my Dad was born, too. I see... they used to live here, huh? "Go and take a closer look at my hometown..." ...Grandpa used to say to us often. Here's where everyone used to eat their meals... ...where the children used to play... ...or fight with their spouse... ...those kinds of things. But they must've enjoyed living here. "Having good memories is enough to make you want to live." That's what my Grandpa used to say... Guess that's true, isn't it? Let's go and see more at the back. There used to be lots of people who lived here... ...right in this place. - No. - Why not? Just one drink, okay? When the mines closed down, everyone left for the town. My parents met in the town again, and got married. So then, you and your brother were born. Even if Mom and Dad spent a short time together, it was still good. Hmm? What happened? My dad left us. For some woman. Grandpa then spent his money to open the diner. He kept saying, 'I'm sorry, I'm sorry for that son of mine..." He kept saying that to my mom even on his deathbed. I'm sorry... uhm, for having to ask you to take us out here. It's okay. It's been a long time, too... since I've thought about Grandpa. Akemi-chan! - Stop it! - Oww~! What the hell... We've only just met! But I've loved you from the start! - That's a lie. - No, it's true! Really, I don't think a relationship should depend on the length of time. It shouldn't be like that! Hey, don't go. Don't be like that. Please don't go... just one kiss.... No~! Please wait... just for a sec. - I don't want to! - Hey, wait. Ouch! Akemi-chan, I really love youuu~!! You cut that out! You dare do that in this place that's full of precious memories for her? Yes, sir. Apologize. I do admit that I behaved a little too aggressively. Uhm... I'm sorry! Idiot... not to me! I'm truly sorry. Akemi-chan, forgive him. - You stay in the back. - Okay. Sorry, Akemi-chan. Forget it. No, I meant about this cow sh*t. It's stinking up your car. Later, I'll buy you some car freshener. It's okay. I'm used to the smell of cow dung. Thank you. Akemi-chan is just too kind. Told you I don't mind it. But really, it does smell bad. - Ugh... - Hey! - Idiot! - It stinks, right? Huh? What happened? Ah, a police car... it's the police, right? What're they doing at our inn? Did something happen? I know... perhaps there's a murder. - Maybe I'm the culprit. - Idiot! - Hey, you're scared of me? - Of course not. Are you Shima Yusaku? Were you released from Abashiri Prison on the 15th? Can you come with us to the police station for awhile? Alright. Get in please. Oba-chan... ...did he say he came from a prison? That man killed a person 7 years ago in Yagishiri Island. I remember... There was such an incident then. Well, murders rarely happen in these areas. But I do remember it created a big fuss. It's hard to believe that that person is actually a criminal, eh? I couldn't tell he could've done such a thing... Me, too but... ...somehow, I did sense he had been hiding a secret past. But I don't see him as a bad guy. I didn't sense... ...anything bewildering about him either. But I did have a feeling about him that was stored up somewhere in my mind. This morning, I was reminded of it when a customer came in. So I called the police... Oh, dear... did I do something unnecessary? Translation and fine timing: earthcolors Raw provider and retiming: furransu - Hey... - Yes. - Store this bike for me. - Yes, sir. - Have you seen the dentist, Chief? - Yeah, I've been in pain since this morning. I haven't liked dentists much since I was a kid. - Please take care of that. - Yes, sir. Wait a second, please. You're Shima, aren't you? Oh, Watanabe-san. Wow... you've been released? Yes, on the 15th. I see, I see... well, it's been seven years since then, eh? Well, good for you... Congratulations. - I see that you're now in charge of this section. - Nah... Huh? What's the matter? Why are you here? Hey, look here, I'm the one who's in charge of his case 7 years ago. I'm familiar with this fella. Well, the inn reported him as being suspicious. - Eh? Did you do something? - No... Well, he didn't do anything particular... we're just asking him questions... What the-- Look, I'm well aware of who this fella is. I know him very well, okay? Alright, alright, that's enough of that... come come, Shima. I know him, alright? I see... you already served your sentence, eh? Doggone, I remember it. That was so long ago. You were unlucky that that person died. You were convicted for it... ...and had no choice but to go to prison. C'mon now, drink your tea. - Itadakimasu. - Yeah. We get new tea leaves from my wife's folks in Shizuoka. Oh, by the way, how's your wife doing? Well... ...we've divorced since then. Is that so. Well... I guess it can't be helped, eh? But she was a good person though. Uhm, so what are you doing in this place? Oh, maybe because... you wanted to return to Yagishiri? Not actually... I just wanted to see the island a bit. But as soon as tomorrow comes, I'll be leaving for the city. I see... Well, life ain't so easy, but you just hang in there, okay? Besides, you're still young compared to me. Watanabe-san, thank you for taking care of me. Don't mention it... My eyes are gettin' dim, and my teeth are gettin' rickety... ...Just now, I've been to the dentist. And next year I'm up for mandatory retirement, too. What're you planning to do after you retire? Yeah, well... ...I think I'll spend time with my grandkids and do some fishin'. Yeah? Excuse me, sir. Huh? Oh, yeah, yeah. - Here, you can have this. - No need... C'mon, just take it. Just seal it up properly, okay? Okay okay, I heard you. Hold your horses, I'm comin'. What... Did you come to see me? Yeah. Sorry for making you worry. See you around. Yuu-san! The inn sent us to fetch you back. That's right. Ride with us. So what happened 7 years ago? You heard it. I killed a man. But we don't see you as a person who would do such a thing. What happened? Please tell us? Is there somebody there on that island? You did say some time ago, Akemi-chan... "Having good memories is enough to make you want to live." Nii-san, you said you had a part-time job in Otaru, right? Yeah. Were you from Otaru? My father was a fisherman. "A ship plank is just one step closer to hell,"* as we said before... [*being only an inch or two from a watery grave] ...Being a fisherman is hard and I didn't want to be one. Just live my life and not take things seriously... That's what I wanted. But I don't know what else was there for me. Eventually... ...I just became a good-for-nothing punk. I went swaggering... ...and strutting around small towns, not really caring about anything... I got in trouble with the cops and they detained me... But when I came out of detention... ...my dad had already died. My relatives blamed me for it... ...I couldn't bear it so I had to leave town. I had to get back on my feet and get a job. But then, I had no friends in other towns... So that's why... ...I drifted along life's current, and I ended up on that island. I took on the job of my dad which I I had been unwilling to do... Well, I didn't think of fishing much, anyway. After all, for me, it's only fishing. I tire myself out and go home just to sleep. Every day, I don't think about anything... ...and just do my work like what cattle and horses do. Until the day... ...when I met that woman. Welcome back! Hey, we've returned. Shima, give that box to her. Oh, he's new? You haven't met him? He's Shima, he has been riding in my boat for some time now. I see... Hello. Mitsue-chan is the 'madonna'* of this island. [*admired lady; idol] He's just teasing. If this woman wishes to be with you you'd be willing to kick out your wife, right? Well, your wife had just been telling me... "I'll be glad to kick him out myself." - That woman. - Thanks for this. See you. - Hey, Mit-chan! - Coming! Yes! - Yes? - 4 yakko (cold tofu). Yup, 4 yakko. - I'll have one of this. - Okay, one order. - You have sashimi? - How do you want it? This one... a 3-sampler dish? Okay, got it. This is on the house. Mit-chan, this guy, Kasumi... he wants to go out with you. Well, I'm not sure about Mit-chan... Unfortunately, there's a lot of men on that island who had been pursuing her... ...Men like you who might just be looking for some sympathy. Shima-san, why don't you just go and get services from a bar girl. - That's enough, move this now. - Yep. Hello. Are you on a break today? I have to put these out on the water later this afternoon, so I gotta finish this by noon. I see. Before you came here to this island, where did you come from? Otaru. Try to work hard with the people here, okay? It is difficult... ...to try and fit in with everyone in such a small island. I also at first had my share of difficulties. You're sweating like crazy! Like wearing a heavy sweater. Here, I don't need this anymore... you can wipe your sweat with it. It'll be summer soon. In just a short time, it'll become really busy on this island. Which means more earnings for me. Okay, see you at the diner. - Thanks for this. - Sure. Wait... Here. So big! For me? - It's heavy! - So sorry. Thank you! - Which do you think it'll be? - I still haven't heard anything yet. - It's better that way, right? - I'm looking forward to it. Welcome! I'm going now. - Thanks. - I enjoyed the meal. - Take care. - Yep, thanks. Beer? Yeah. That man's wife... ...will soon have a baby. Oh, that's right, thanks for the octopus. I'll let you have some octopus sashimi, alright? - Uh... - Hmm? Here. Oh, you should've just thrown it away, you didn't have to wash this hankie. Well, it does look clean. Shima-san, did you iron this? No, I didn't. What I did was... ...I expanded and stretched it and let it dry by the window. Really? It's so neat, it could've fooled me. That summer had ended briefly... ...and fall came in fast. Before I knew it... ...I found myself going to her diner on a daily basis... To drink sake... ...Or maybe to help add to her earnings. I didn't understand it at that time. But I wanted to see her smile... Not just her business-like smile... ...the kind of neutral smile... ...which she shows to everyone... ...But maybe I wanted a special smile... ...that was meant for me. What an awful rain! You think this will become snow? Thanks as always. Good night. What's the matter? What is it? - Is there someone...? - Someone who? Is there someone...like a guy who had displeased you? If there is such a guy, what about it? I'm gonna beat him up. There's no such person. I understand what you're feeling, s-so go home now. What happened to you tonight? Hey, go on home now. - If there's a guy who had displeased you... - I told you there's none! There was a guy or two I knew before... There was also someone who was married... But you know what...? I don't want to cause problems by borrowing someone else's possession. Just go home. Speaking of being 'displeased...' ...right now, I'm not pleased with you at all! No! Let me go. I was aggressive. I almost took her by force. But... I was serious with her. If I let her get away... ...I will never find another person I could love in my life. So I thought... ...I mustn't let go of this woman. Oh! Mt. Rishiri can be seen today. Today, we'll be coming from Musashi-tai (shoal). We'll be back later. - Okay, be careful. - Yeah. Have a safe trip. Thank God! I was so worried! The radio was broken, we couldn't contact home. I'm so glad you've returned safely. Hey, you'll get wet. By the way... I'll be going to the clinic today. Why? You're not feeling well? No... Eh? So then... If you're not feeling sick, then why are you going to the cli-- Are you... perhaps... ... having a baby? Oh... I see... I see! Still, it's not sure yet. Oh, guess you're right. So, once you know... ...contact me, alright? - Okay. I'll radio the boat? - Yeah, do that! - Okay. Have a safe trip! But the thing is... I don't want the captains to make a fuss about it. So should I fax the boat? Everyone will see it. Maybe you should take my mobile phone. Oh, you're right. Here. How about you? I'll just borrow a phone from somewhere. - Okay. - Have a safe trip. - But there's no signal out there! - Eh? Oh... I know... If you're pregnant, tie this on the pole back there. The pole? Here. On top of that pole. Oh, no... such a hassle. Don't say that. It's not that impossible. Do it for me. Okay, I understand. You must find a way. Shima, is your wife doing well? Well, yeah. My wife, the other day, said... 'Mit-chan who loves talking ending up with a man who hardly talks...' '...how can those two live together?...' '...I wanna see how they do it.' I know it, right? Your wife talks on and on while you sit and listen? But no matter how you look at it, she still might not be satisfied? Well, at the most, there are two talkative people at my place... It's becoming a problem with all the noise they make. Just the other day, I scolded my daughter... "Will the both of you shut up...?" "...I can't hear the TV with all your yappin'!" Hey, what're you grinnin' at? Ah?... Nothing.... Yosuke! When I ran back home... ...my body felt like it was floating on air. I wanted to become a father. Really wanted to be one. So did you have a child, Yuu-san? What happened? There will be many expenses once the baby is born. So without me knowing it, she continued working. Then one day... ...she slipped and tumbled down. Sorry to make you wait... ...what happened was surely unfortunate, no? Ma'am, you've had miscarriaged before, right? If you have miscarriaged, it's likely gonna be repeated... ...so next time, please be careful. And if you feel something's wrong, come and visit me. So take care, okay? Why didn't you tell me? About... ...my miscarriage before? We both have... ...many personal things that happened in our pasts. We agreed on that before we got together, right? 'You don't have to say anything,' isn't that what you said? Or do you want to know everything now? What do you want to know about my past? What is it then? Is there anything else you're hiding from me? Huh?! Why...? Why the child...? My child...! The happiness I've longed to have... ...was destroyed by a guy's carelessness. The feeling I had... At that time... ...was of despair. Once I get upset... ...I become confused. Hey, Pops! Wait a minute, you, hey! You assh*le! - Hey! - Come at me! Ya wanna f*ck with me?! C'mon! The next thing I knew, a man was dead. But that time... ...I can't remember well how it happened. Is that true? Yeah. But you didn't do it on purpose, did you? The court convicted me... with 'manslaughter with intention to kill.' - But why? - That's right... You had a wife, right?... Why would they do such a thing...? It might as well be at that time... ...for someday, I might do something similar. So I made a decision. Since I'm already damaged... I thought that I could never... ...make Mitsue happy. What is this? Press your seal on it, and submit it to the City Hall. So you can have your freedom back. Afterwards, go and find another man to love. Why? Why did you decide on this without consulting me? You acted all aggressively to make me marry you... ...even now when getting a divorce? You really do things selfishly... ...just because it's convenient for you?! What about MY feelings? I am... ...just a good-for-nothing punk. I'm someone who's not meant to be happy. That's just the thing, I guess. But... I'm done talking about this. Thanks for listening. I'll be heading to the city tomorrow morning. You, too, should find some work somewhere. Yuu-san's wife... ...I wonder how she's feeling. Hey, what do you think-- Huh? Are you sleeping? Kin-chan.... Me... What the hell am I doing? I'm not taking my life seriously. I'm just useless.... I'm useless.... You want a drink? Yuu-san did say it. He told you, 'You, too, should hang in there and find a job somewhere.' Yeah. I, for the meantime, will be here... continue working with my mom. Hey, don't cry anymore. I'm glad that I got to meet you and Yuu-san. Me, too. Hey~! Oba-san said Yuu-san had already checked out. Uh... You're right. What've you been doing...? Hurry and come with me! Uh, excuse me! Did a tall guy come in here? I mean he's about 190 cm tall (6' 2''), sorta grim-looking... ...Has a deep voice and a stubble, have you seen such a man? He's about this tall... Nope, didn't see him. I knew he didn't leave! Wonder where he went. There! We found him! Yuu-san! Thank goodness, we found you. Why didn't you say you were leaving? I did tell you last night, 'I'll leave when morning comes,' didn't I? Last night, the two of us had a talk... ...We want you to ask you something. Yuu-san, you really want to go back to the island, don't you? You want to see your wife, right? She and I are divorced, it's too late for that. But you were here the first time we met... ...you were looking towards the island. Actually... ...after I came out of prison... I went to the post office and sent her a post card. I wrote on that post card... "I was released today..." "...and heading towards Haboro now..." "If ever..." "If ever you're still single..." "And by chance, have been waiting for me..." "Get the yellow handkerchief..." "...and raise it up on top of the pole just like the last time." "It will be your signal." "If from the ferry, I do not see a handkerchief..." "...I will leave the island right away..." "...and never appear before you again." ...Well, it was something like that. Let's go. That's right, we MUST go, Yuu-san. Let's go, Yuu-san. What time does the next ferry leave? We can't wait for that anymore! You wait here while I'll go ask someone. - Don't go anywhere, okay? - Okay. Can you speed it up a little? This boat's just like me, we're both short of breath. ...Cryin out loud. Come here and look at the island, Yuu-san. - Hey. - Huh? What is it? On second thought, let's go back. Go back... you mean to Haboro?! What is it? What's the matter? Yuu-san says he wants to go back. What?! But we're already here so why should we go back? What if... ...she has decided to live with someone else? Or has torn down the house... There's no way she would wait for me for 7 years. But we'll be there soon! And don't say such a thing! We'll go anyway, alright? No... enough of this. We'll just go near and have a little look, okay? C'mon, Yuu-san, let's go with it! Shut up~! Take me back now! Stop talking about it and turn this boat around! Ah~.. alright, fine! We're turning back! We're never coming back here again! So be it then! Hey, Pops! Let's head back! - But we're almost there. - Never mind! Let's go back! - Are you sure you wanna go back? - Yeah! Turn it around! ...For cryin' out loud...again! Yuu-san, I do understand what you're feeling... But what if by chance, the hankie's there? That's why we have to go, right? Darnnit~... Okay then! What if you close your eyes... ...and I'll be the one to look! If there's no handkerchief, I won't say anything... We'll just turn the boat around and go straight back... Is that okay with you? Kin-chan, let's go! Okay. Uhm... can we please head back to the island once again? You're kiddin,' right? No, I'm truly sorry for what happened awhile ago. So please, Oji-san? You damn fool! Yuu-san, we're almost at the island. Where's your house located? On the east of the island. At the end of the village, there's an elementary school. And also some hotels and houses. At the very end of that... ...you'll see our house. Got it. Go towards the east of the island! Okie-dokie. Hey, Kin-chan... ...the wife could've moved, right? Yeah, she could have.... If so, it can't be helped, huh? If the wife did move... it'll be no use so... Anyway... ...at least we did something. Yeah, it wasn't all in vain. Because we got to help out a friend. Huh? What? Yuu-san! Yuu-san! Look! Look at it! Look! Handkerchiefs! Good for you! - You did it! - Yatta~! - This is great! - Yay! - I'm glad~! - Yatta! Take care always. And thank you. So then... Go now. Good thing we came, right? Be happy, okay?! Yuu-san~! So, shall we go back? Yeah.
