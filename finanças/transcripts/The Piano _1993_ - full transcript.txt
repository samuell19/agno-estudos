(DARK ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) WOMAN: The voice you hear is not my speaking voice, but my mind's voice. I have not spoken since I was six years old. No-one knows why. Not even me. Come on. (HORSE WHINNIES) My father says it is a dark talent, and the day I take it into my head to stop breathing will be my last. (ROLLERSKATES GLIDE) Today, he married me to a man I've not yet met. Soon, my daughter and I shall join him in his own country. My husband said my muteness does not bother him. He writes, and hark this, God loves dumb creatures, so why not he? Were good he had God's patience... ...for silence affects everyone in the end. The strange thing is I don't think myself silent. That is because of my piano. I shall miss it on the journey.

She says, "Thank you." (MEN SING) (MAN LAUGHS) Does your mother prefer to come on with us to Nelson? She says no. She says she'd rather be boiled alive by natives than get back in your stinking tub.

I've got men here to carry your things. (SPEAKS MAORI) Well, I see you've got a good many boxes. I'd like to know what's in each... (GASPS) Can you hear me? Well, that's good. Yes, that's good. What's in this one? You're small. I never thought you'd be small. And this one? It's very large. What's in it, then, a bedstead? It's my mother's piano. Baines, tell them to carry in pairs. Take all the boxes, table and, uh... ...suitcases. What do you think? She looks tired. She's stunted, that's one thing. MAN: And the big case? No, no. Just the trunks and the boxes as I explained. No, it can't come now. It must. She wants it to come. Yes, and so do I. But there are too few of us here to carry it now. Too heavy! What, you mean you don't want your clothing or your kitchenware to come? Is that what you mean? We can't leave the piano! Look, let's not discuss this any further. I'm very pleased that you arrived safely. Mother wants to know if they can come back directly for it. Could I apologise for the delay, which I regret... After they've taken the other things. (MAN SPEAKS IN MAORI) (LAUGHTER) Might I suggest that you prepare yourself for a difficult journey? The bush will tear clothing and the mud is very deep in places. What do they think they're doing? We haven't time for this. Baines! (MOURNFUL PIANO MUSIC) (PEOPLE CONVERSE IN MAORI AND LAUGH) (SPEAKS MAORI) What's the matter? Why are they stopping? (SPEAKS MAORI) That's the way to the burial grounds. It's tapu. We came down this way. I'm sure we did. (MAN SPEAKS MAORI) They want more money. They're trying to make two days out of it. No. No, they know another track to the side of this. (RAIN POURS, THUNDER CRASHES) Septimus, now take that off! Take that off! (LAUGHS) Watch your feet! Mind your feet! Septimus! Please stop it!

If you cannot have a ceremony together, you'll have at least a photograph. Careful. The lace is most fragile. My real father was a famous German composer. They met when my mother was an opera singer in Luxembourg. Why? I want to be in the photograph. Going to leave the cloth here? No, no. It is just to keep the chair dry. I almost slipped on the planks. They've gotten very greasy. Give the lady a chair. Pull the tarpaulin. I am sorry it rained. We have not light enough inside. Shall I hold the umbrella on this side or t'other? On the t'other! Move over. Can you take this, please? And sitting... (THUNDER CRASHES) Uh... Very still. And where did they get married? In an enormous forest with real fairies as bridesmaids, each holding a little elf's hand. No, I tell a lie. It was in a small country church in the mountains. Which mountains are those, dear? The Pyrenees. Oh. I've never been there. Mother used to sing the songs in German and her voice would echo across the valleys. That was before the accident. And what happened? One day, when my mother and father were singing together in the forest, a great storm blew up out of nowhere. But so passionate was their singing that they did not notice nor did they stop as the rain began to fall. And when their voices rose for the final bars of the duet, a great bolt of lightning came out of the sky and struck my father, and then he lit up like a torch. And at the same moment my father was struck dead, my mother was struck dumb. She never spoke another word. Oh, dear! Not another word? Well, from the shock. Yes. It would be. Terrible. Terrible. Terrible. Oh. (TUTS) Terrible, terrible. Yeah, there... (LACE RIPS) Dear? (MOURNFUL PIANO MUSIC) (THUNDER RUMBLES) (FOOD CRUNCHES) Sorry. Um, I have to go away for some days. There's some Maori land I'm interested in which I may buy very reasonably. Well, I hope you'll spend the time to get settled in and perhaps... in some ways... ...we could start again. Alright? (DOOR CLOSES) (DOOR CREAKS OPEN) I'm not able to read. Please take us back to the beach where we landed. I am sorry. I can't do that. I don't have the time. Goodbye.

(BOTH SING 'GOD SAVE THE QUEEN') ALISDAIR: I mean, I knew she was mute, but now I'm thinking... ...perhaps it's more than that. I'm wondering if she's not brain-affected. (GIRLS SING) Shush! No sound at all? Well, no. It was a table. Well, she was very violent with the gown. She tore off a chunk of lace. If I hadn't been there to see it, I'd have sworn she'd have used her teeth and wiped her feet on it. Wiped her feet on it. Well, it hasn't come to anything yet. It's simply a concern, that's all. Yes. Yes, of course. A concern. There's something to be said for silence. MORAG: Indeed. Cotton. And with time, I'm sure she'll become... affectionate.
