Yang He, you're leaving now? Mr. Film needs this quickly. Otherwise who would go this late? Let's have a quick drink. Which Yang? From the collective farm. Who else could it be? Supervisor Yang is your elder brother? Yes. Is the screening finished? Did it include the Newsreel? What? The Newsreel. Go and see for yourself. Where can I see it? Tomorrow, the 2nd Unit will show it. How do I get there? Head east. "Heroic Sons and Daughters" - Reel 6 If I had known you were a girl, I wouldn't have hit you. Why did you steal this? To sell it? None of your damn business. Who are you? Get lost. Let's take half each. What kind of girl are you? Running around at night, carrying a knife. Give my knife back. Where do you live? Hey, seriously. Half each. All right? Or just give me 12.5 meters? 12.5 meters, what for? Nothing. Just give it to me. You're from the 2nd Unit? Yes. I'm from the 4th Unit. Why are you by yourself? I'm looking for someone. Who are you looking for? I tell you, in this place you shouldn't just wander around. It's an empty desert. If I hadn't picked you up you'd have died of thirst. Pick that person up. No. Not enough room. She's the one I'm looking for. Who is she? My daughter. She ran away three days ago. Come on, stop the truck! Stop! All right. All right. Just get in! You think you can run? This child! Terrible. Did you steal something and run away? How can you be so out of control? Your father has chased you for days! What father? Isn't that your father? Him? My father died ages ago. I should slap you. You dare to speak like that? He's been worried sick about you. Right? You're lucky you ran into me. What if he died of thirst? You'd have no home to cry in. Girl, I don't know your family business, but no matter how far you run, he's still your father. You only have one set of parents. Right? Don't do something you'll regret. All right? You two are in my truck, so you have to listen to me. Say sorry to him. Fine! Sorry is sorry. He is my father. You know what kind of man he is? What kind of man is he? He has a mistress. Our family doesn't have enough to eat, but he took a whole year's harvest and gave it to his mistress. My mother tried to stop him, and he argued with her, threatened to divorce. My mother got ill. She couldn't afford medicine. so now it's just me and my little brother. Mother died. My brother is still young, I don't have a job. We can't go on like this, so we went to look for him. He wouldn't open his door. We knocked on the door for ages. Finally his mistress came out fighting, beating me and my little brother. Enough. That's just like my father. Are you human? Totally heartless! Worse than a dog! Actually, I'm not her father. Now, you deny it? He chased me all this way just to take my can. Inside is the money and food stamps my mother left me. He even wants to take that. Give her the can! You hand her the can. Now! Damn thug. You believe her? Stop! Quick, stop the truck! Telling me to stop?? Get lost! Let's go! Little bitch! - Stop! - Can't stop. It'll break again! Stop that truck! It has the film. Stop it! The film reel. Stop that truck! You idiot! 8pm tonight, national film: "HEROIC SONS AND DAUGHTERS" Mr. Film, What time is the screening? The film hasn't arrived yet. Calm down. - Have some peanuts. - All right, all right. Take some sunflower seeds. When does the film arrive? That depends on whether Yang He screws up or not. Isn't it "Fighting North and South"? Why did you change it to "Heroic Sons and Daughters"? "Heroic Sons and Daughters" is better. Definitely. Yes, "Heroic Sons and Daughters" is better. We like "Heroic Sons and Daughters". What's so great about "Fighting North and South"? Hello, Mr. Fan. - Mr. Film, time for noodles? - Mm. Mr. Film is here. Come, sit. Mr. Fan. Mr. Film is here. Mr. Film, you sit here. I'll sit over there. Here are your noodles. Your "father" is eating your noodles. Is it hard to bear? Sit. Reporting... Comrade projectionist. The film reel. What reel? "Heroic Sons and Daughters", Reel 6. It really is "Heroic Sons and Daughters". Where did you get this? I'm just returning it, that's all. Get back here! Have a seat. Sit down! I know you. Aren't you Orphan Liu from our 2nd Unit? Comrade, you're not from our 2nd Unit, are you? I'm from the 1st Unit. The 1st Unit? Then how do you two know each other? And how did the reel end up in your hands? Am I wrong to return the reel to you? Of course not. But ... good comrades should explain good deeds, eh? - Waiter. - Yes? - Two more bowls of noodles. - All right. It's on me. And bring my stuff over. All right. Coming. - Your noodles. - Mm. I put extra hot peppers in the noodles. Mr. Film, please get me a good seat at the screening. - Consider it done. - Thank you! Do you know why I get extra hot peppers? It's because I'm highly respected by everyone in the 2nd Unit. Do you know why everyone calls me Mr. Film? It's because I've been screening films my whole life, and I've never made a mistake. Screening films in a place like this is serious business. It's a tough crowd out there. They've been waiting for 2 months. Each time it's like a New Year celebration. So I can say, film reels are treasures to us. However many come in, the same number must be returned. We check the count several times. This is called ... taking responsibility. FILM PROJECTIONIST 001 How did this reel get separated from the others? How are you two connected to Yang He? The fellow on the motorcycle? That's right, that's right. He transports the reels. His name is Yang He. How did this reel end up in your hands? We picked it up on the road. Which road? The road from the 1st Unit. This must have been poorly secured, so it fell off the bike. And Yang He wants to be a projectionist? If he were the projectionist it would be a nightmare for everyone in the 2nd Unit. - Was this the only reel on the road? - Yes. Just this one. Comrade, what's your name? What do you do in the 1st Unit? She could have brought it back alone. Why are you here? He's a bad element. A vandal. Who? You I'm what? I said you're a bad element. A vandal What makes you think I'm a bad element? You are a vandal. Why don't you tell him about your business? - You're a vandal. - What did I - That's enough. I knew from the start you're bad. Alert the Security Division. Right. Alert the Security Division. - What are you up to? - Why are you alerting the Security Division? - Why did you come here? - I came to watch the film. My daughter is in the film. I came to watch my daughter. Your daughter is in "Heroic Sons and Daughters"? Your daughter plays Wang Fang, the main character in the film? Who do you think you're fooling? Let's get the Security Division. Before the film you play a Newsreel. My daughter is in the Newsreel. Wait a minute. The Newsreel reports national news, the great advancement of Mao Zedong thought. We must study the Newsreel. Should we study your daughter? Her school teaches labour and farming, to serve the people. Someone saw the Newsreel and wrote me a letter. What letter? - Your daughter is a student. - Yes, a student Mr. Film, Mr. Film! Big problem! We can't watch the film! Ah? What happened? - We can't screen the film. - What? What's going on? Mr. Film is here! Problem. Big problem! Yang He! Where's Yang He? Where the hell is he? Say something! Dad... It was me. Dad... - You drove the cart? - Yes. Why are Yang He's reels on your cart? His motorcycle broke again. He was worried it couldn't be repaired. He insisted I bring the reels to you. And this is how you did it? You think you're pulling a donkey? It's all twisted, like intestines. I don't have eyes in the back of my head. Who knew this stuff could roll out? Where's the sticky tape? The tape sealing the can? I wrapped it around my whip. Why the hell did you do that? My whip was falling apart. You're afraid the whip will fall apart, but you're not afraid the reels will get damaged? What are we supposed to watch then? You idiot! Isn't that a reel in your hand? Use that one. Problem solved. What the hell are you talking about? This is a drama. That's the Newsreel. They're totally different. You think men and women are the same? You really have shit for brains. Number 22. The letter said Newsreel No. 22. Now it's all twisted up. It doesn't matter who is in No. 22. Comrades... no screening today. We can't watch the Newsreel. But we can still watch the film, right? That's right. With such a big problem how could we screen the film? Everyone can see. No film today. But it's not our fault. You can screen it. There is a way. How? Don't you have some special liquid that can clean this? - You mean cleaning fluid? - Yes. I don't! Besides ... it's way too dirty! How can I clean it? You tell me! Do you understand? Know-all! But of course ... We could make one last attempt and try to rescue it. Do you all want to watch the film? Yes! All right. If you want to watch the film please come forward and be the witnesses that todayâ€™s big accident is completely Yang He's fault. Right. It is. What's more, I have two requirements. If we succeed, we can watch the film. If we fail, no film! We can do it. Firstly, we all have to keep quiet about this. This incident cannot get out. Otherwise, our 2nd Unit will never screen films again. We will all suffer. Secondly, superiors will deal with Yang He. I will deal with the reel. Female comrades, go and fetch bed sheets, masks, and gauze steamers, chopsticks, and basins. Male comrades, go and fetch metal wire, size 12. Make sure it's clean. Everybody agreed? All right! Get me these things right away. Action! Get out of here. Walk around! If you step on the film, I'll kill you! Put the film down. I picked this up off the ground. That's the bit with my daughter in it. It's not! It might be. Just put it down! Show yourself! Give me the film. Give me the film of my daughter. Come out! This doesn't have your daughter. Not there, right? It's all white. It's just the beginning. You take it. I don't want it. It doesn't look good. What do you want the film for anyway? What does it matter what it looks like? To make a lampshade. A lampshade? My little brother is a good student. He loves to read. But our lamp at home is too dim. I was afraid he'd damage his eyesight. So I borrowed a lamp. The lampshade was made of film. He accidentally burned the lampshade. Now they want compensation. They chase us every day. He's afraid to leave the house. My poor brother. So helpless. So what you said on the truck is true? What's your name? Orphan Liu. I know you're Orphan Liu. I mean your real name. It's just Orphan Liu. My little brother is Little Boy Liu. Is that his "real name", too? No father, no mother. The authorities just gave us these names. Don't cause trouble tonight. Let me watch the film. After that, I'll help you. What can you do? Hey, what's your name? Why are you afraid of the Security Division? Careful, careful. Hold on. Hold it there... Up the steps. Good. Careful. You all follow my instructions. Come on. Turn it over. Move. Come on. Easy, easy, easy. A little more that way. Good. Good. Good. Stop! Let go gently. Good. Good ... good. This end mustn't be moved. Chopsticks! Get chopsticks. Follow it from the start, and find the other end. Whatever you do, don't scratch it. - Got it? - Got it. Put the screen up, and keep everyone outside. All right. What are you clapping for? We still haven't found the start of the reel! Here, straighten it. Hold the sides, not the middle. Remove the dirt. It's mostly just surface dirt. Distilled water. Distilled water. The condensation will create distilled water. Don't get it dirty. Great. Steam it. Careful, careful. Step aside. The distilled water is here! Out of the way! Behind me, careful where you step. Don't spill anything. Move aside. Make way up ahead! Squeeze the excess water out. Then we start to wipe. Not too loose, not too tight. Wipe downwards. One direction only. Remember this point. Repeat this action. Wipe it in sections. - Got it? - Got it. - Good. Let's start. - All right. Hey! You're not washing intestines! Let me see your fingernails. No ... No! Stop, stop, stop, stop! Female comrades, stay! Male comrades, leave! Quick, quick, quick! Children too - all leave! Anyone with a fan at home, bring it back here. All right. This is delicate work. Not like separating noodles. I ... ... know how to develop photos. - You? - Yes. Really? I can also enlarge prints. Wash your hands over there. Use soap. Wash twice. Wash your face too. You really have done this before! After it's cleaned, can you screen it? As long as it's clean, I can screen it. Look, everyone. It's hard work to rescue a reel. So many people want to be a projectionist. Like that Yang He. That bastard was just a pig feeder, using his brother's position to try to replace me. I won't let him. Right, of course not. What did I tell you? Are you making trouble again? How am I making trouble? I came to help clean the film. Get out of here! Why? Can't I help? You just wait! Little brother. Sister. Where have you been these days? Did the neighbour feed you? Yes. She also asked where you went. It's got extra hot peppers. Smell good? Eat up! Sister, you eat too. I've already eaten. We'll watch the film later. "Heroic Sons and Daughters". I'm not going. All the children are going. I'm not going. Did they bully you again? You should go! Why won't you go? What are you doing here? Little Boy Liu. Your sister told me you burned a lampshade? It's all right. You can still watch the film. Don't be scared. The bullies are going too, right? What are you going to do? If they bully you again, just tell me. What can you do? Fight them, of course. Sister, who is he? A bad element. Now... the film is clean! But ... before the film is dry don't move around too much. Otherwise, there'll be too much dust in the air. If you have a fan, raise your hand. I have two. Come up here. Stay in order. Form a queue. Be careful, everyone. Don't touch the film. It's not dry yet. Too many people create poor circulation. The film will dry slowly. If you fan it, it will dry quickly. But remember... a gentle breeze. Very soft. - Understand? - Understood. Good. Spread out. Let's try. Very soft, right? Very good. What are you doing? Think you're the Wind Goddess? Fan too hard and it will stick together. Just a gentle breeze. Very soft. Don't use your arm. Just your wrist. Hey! Where did you disappear to? You'll need to help me load the film. What are you doing? Don't touch it. The film contains our model citizens. Their faces cannot be smudged by your dirty fingers. Carry on. Softly, softly. That's it. Nice and slow. Circulate the air, and the film will dry quickly. Good, that should do it. You can all go back now. They're coming back! Put these on. Careful, don't tangle it. It's tangled. It's tangled You see, it's tangled. Hold it level. Make it flat. Hold it level. Hold it flat. Oh ... I forgot, I forgot, I forgot, I forgot! I knew a section was missing. I sent them to look for it. You had it all along. Where did you get it? Orphan Liu gave it to me. Don't lie to me. I know a film thief when I see one. - Making lampshades, fixing bicycles - - I didn't! You're caught! Let's go to the Security Division - She gave it to me. - Who gave it to you? Yang He? Trying to ruin the screening? Let's go to the Security Division. Coming or not? If not, I'll tell them myself. You just got out of prison? I just escaped! From a labour camp? Yes, escaped from a labour camp. Do you know why I risked it? To watch your daughter in the film. Number 22. How long will it play for? - About 10 minutes. - I mean when do you send No. 22 back? I'll send it back after tonight. Then two months later we will screen Newsreel No. 23. So you understand, this is my only chance. If I can't watch No. 22, I'll slit your throat. If you tell anyone, I'll slit your throat. If you report to the Security Division, and I get caught, when I'm released, I will not spare you. And I'll still slit your throat Understand? Yes. You'll slit my throat. I'm not here to slit your throat. I'm here to watch No. 22! I understand. You're here to watch No. 22. Have a seat. You sit. You'll see your daughter soon. How old is she? 14. She was eight when I went in. Can I ask you something? Why were you sent to a labour camp? For fighting. I punched a Red Guard. You were framed. For just one fight... Don't you understand politics? Your wife and daughter didn't visit? My wife divorced me. My daughter didn't want a father like me. I can understand. It's not just you. Don't be so hard on yourself. It's tangled. Slow down! I ... I'm sorry. I'll wind it slowly. Nice and slow. I was going too fast. Is this all right? Stop there. Let's go. Hurry up. Hurry up! Don't dawdle. - Faster! - Come on, faster. Hurry up! Faster. Go in there! Go on. Hurry up. So? I tried so hard but didn't get a chance. - Wait a little longer. - Wait for what? The film will be gone tomorrow. Your little brother is really clumsy. I'm losing sleep over my lampshade. If I could buy one we wouldn't be here. Please, I'll think of something. Think of something? How long do you need to think? When do we get the lampshade? Tell me when! We'll hit you every time we see you. I'll turn on the projector. When it's finished, wind up the film and bring it to me. I'll be just over there. And don't forget to turn off the light. Thank you. The rescue mission was a success! We can screen the film! Turn off the lights. Turn off the lights! Hold this. What do you want? Who the hell are you? - Do you know Little Boy Liu? - Yes. He's under my protection. You can't touch him. - Come with me. - I'm not going anywhere. - Who are you? - I'm not going. What the hell? What's going on down there? Are we watching a film or having a fight? What's more important? The film teaches us to be better. You should learn from it. Comrades of the 2nd Unit, separate them! Let me go! Where's the Newsreel? Aren't we going to watch your daughter? Why are you getting all worked up? Everyone, I have an announcement. It's getting late, so we'll just go straight to the main feature "Heroic Sons and Daughters". How does that sound? Great! CHANGCHUN FILM STUDIOS HEROIC SONS AND DAUGHTERS (Chinese title: 'Ying Xiong Er NÃ¼') based on the novel "Reunion" ("Tuan Yuan") by Ba Jin Don't. You can't lift it Can't lift it? Give me some space. You're blocking the view. Move over. Move! What are you doing? Get out of the way! Quickly! Or I'll beat you! Where's your sister? I don't know. You don't know where your sister is? I don't know. Where did your sister hide the can? The can, did you see it? Did she hide it here? Is it here? Did she come back? You are a bad element! Tell me where she - You're a bad element. You're a bad element. For victory! Fire at me! Dear Leading Cadre, Comrades, Commissar Wang, victory will always belong to us! It's burned! The film is burning. Shut the door! Oh, and - don't leave after the film. Just wait here. Wait for what? Wait for who? Wait until I find the reel. As soon as I find it you'll screen it. You got it? - What reel? - No. 22! Isn't that No. 22? There, on the table? Didn't you send it over with Orphan Liu? Where is she? She went to watch the film. What did she say? She said the lampshade looks pretty. Isn't this lampshade made of film? That's right. It's very fashionable now. Not even 12.5 metres' worth. Mine is more. More than 20 metres. And colour too. Technicolor. Better than anyone else's. When are you coming back? Raging flames roar into an ode Heard by the world to heroes, to heroes The thunder of guns rattles Rough waves thrust high and echo Fight for people, against our foes Give your life for peace for all Crimsoned by the blood of heroes Banners in sunlight brightly glow Nourished by their lives below Spring flowers everywhere grow Why aren't you watching the film? I've seen it many times. This song is really good. I've been looking everywhere for you. What for? I thought... You were great, back there. Everybody is afraid of you. That lot in the 2nd Unit only look out for themselves. The next time I see those thugs I'm going to kill them. There is no "next time". You haven't been home yet? THE END made in 1964 SINCERELY SERVING THE PEOPLE Hebei province The whole staff of the Eastern Road grain store always remember the spirit of Chairman Mao. Under the guidance of "Serve the People" they study the advanced work of the 19th Grain Store and implement the spirit of "Serve the People" in their work. They don't fear hardship, and they don't fear death. Party members take the lead to educate the young students who come to train. Everyone in the store strives to do the best work. Shenyang Heavy Machinery Factory develops its mass movement for industrial production. While adhering to socialism they strive for greatness. Their revolutionary production is booming. The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region is rich in sugarcane. It is a national base for sugar production. In recent years sugar production has developed significantly. Did you see your daughter? She's in there, right? Can you screen it again? Wait a bit. If I screen it now they'll never leave. They'll watch anything, that lot. They'll watch all damn night. After they've all gone please don't hurt me. Why would I hurt you? I'll leave after I've watched it. Thank you. You drink tea? Have some tea. It's Gao Mo tea. The next reel is a mess. Sound and image are scratched up. Dragged behind a cart for miles and miles. Your son ... ... doesn't have your sense. Do you know... why I don't have cleaning fluid? Go on. When my son was four, and didn't know what he was doing, he drank the cleaning fluid. He was vomiting, and had diarrhoea and a high temperature. I didn't take it seriously, but it gave him brain damage. He can only drive a cart now. The whole staff of the Eastern Road Grain Store always remember the spirit of Chairman Mao.

Is she the young girl who's carrying the big sack of flour? Striving for what? She's only 14. Why does she have to compete with adults? She must do her best. As long as she does her best she will gain merit. That's the only way she can be free from your political influence. You've seen your daughter. Don't you need to leave now? I don't want to leave. You can't spend the night here. Please screen it again. One second is too short. It's not enough. If I screen it again it's still only a second. Then screen it 10 times. 10 times? That's still only 10 seconds. If we keep reloading the film it will take all night. The sun will come up. I'll screen it for you 100 times. I'll make a loop. Watch it to your heart's content. This is called a loop. Among all four Units no one else can do this. Careful... Don't block the circuit. Under, under. Go under. All right. Now it's ready. Old fellow, go down and watch. It looks better from down there. As long as there is power you can watch it as long as you want. The whole staff of the Eastern Road Grain Store always remember the spirit of Chairman Mao.

What took you so long? I telephoned you many times. I couldn't come earlier. So many people were watching the film. He has a weapon. What if he went crazy and hurt someone? - You're right. - Where is he? Per your instructions, I've kept him inside, watching the film. - Does he still have the knife? - Yes. Ah, that reminds me, you should all know, he has a nasty temper, and loves to fight. Be careful! We're not scared of him! Officer Cui, did I do a great deed? Of course! Then please tell our leader that there's no one capable of replacing me as projectionist. Party members take the lead to educate the young students who come to train. Everyone in the store strives - Why did you go to my home? It was a mistake. I'm sorry. A mistake?? What's this you're watching? Isn't it No. 22? Didn't I bring it over? You... Please - move your head. Let's discuss it later. Let me finish watching my daughter. You only care about your daughter. What did you do to my little brother? He's still crying at home. I'll apologise to both of you, all right? Not all right! Then what do you want? Go and talk to my little brother. Tell him that you wronged me, that you are a bad element, you won't scare him again, and the Security Division is taking you away. Fine! But let me finish watching my daughter, then I'll go. When I get to your home I'll apologise to both of you. All right? Which one is your daughter? She's coming up. The one carrying the flour bag. Move over. You - - She's just coming up. - Your daughter isn't in this! Why would I lie to you? She's coming on right now. Look! - That's her? - Yes. - Your daughter? - Yes. Carrying that bag didn't kill her? How dare you! Are you hurt? Get off! - Get up first. - Don't touch me. Come on, I'll help you up. - You kicked me. - Sit, sit, sit. - Back off! - Take it easy ... huh? - You - - You can't leave today. I'll get you. I won't spare you. You made a mess at my place, bullied my brother. Is that fair? Don't run! I'll get you. That's him! Grab him. What the hell? Why are you hitting me? Don't run! Block him. Quickly! You've got the wrong person! I'm the one you want. Come after me! It's him. Go! Get him! Go! Get the rope! Tie them up. Didn't you hear me? Quick! Hurry up, idiots! Mr. Fan, start! Right. Father, are you all right now? Yes, I'm all right. Are mother and little brother all right too? They're both fine too. Take a look at this. Little brother! He is a model worker. Reporting, leader. I'm recovered and back to work. - Fully recovered? - Yes, fully. Ah Fang, do you know him? He's our Commissar Wang. Of course I know him. He's Wang Dong, your real father. Wang Fang, it's true. You forgot. I often said I wanted to get more information about Wang Dong. Wang Fubiao brought her up. But Wang Dong is her real father. Do you understand now? Father. To be honest, I miss my father a lot. This is a great thing, Ah Fang. You have a worker father and a revolutionary father. Yes. You should be like your brother. Be a good daughter of the working class, and keep the revolution going. - Did you contact the labour camp? - Yes. Were they surprised? That lot ... they only searched the train and bus stations. What did they say? They've sent a car over. Have some soup. Just put it here. We'll help ourselves. Thanks. We caught him, and we are sending him back. Shouldn't the labour camp treat us to a good meal? Of course! I didn't know they would beat you. Something for you. Mr. Fan, Thank you. Wait. I have a request. Keep moving! What are you looking at? Keep moving! What did Mr. Fan put in your pocket? Huh? Left pocket. - Don't move! - Stay still! What the hell is this? My daughter. That's my daughter. What daughter? Give it back! - Give it back! - Go! Give it to me! Go, go go. Give it to me! Give it back! Shut up. Behave. Keep moving! Keep going! Keep moving! I hear you're not leaving for another two days. Yes, I have something to do. What could that be? Everything is fine now. We've expedited the new policy for you. Times have changed. Hurry home and enjoy your life. Of course I'll go home. SUCCESSFULLY RECRUITING STUDENTS IS THE HOPE OF THE PEOPLE This was the place. One second is too short. It's not enough.
