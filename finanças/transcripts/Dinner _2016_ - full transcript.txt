I don't think I can trust her anymore. He pushed me away. I went all the way to look for him. I was going to propose to her. Now I can't even think of doing that. He threw the first punch. And he betrayed the trust I had in him as a friend. How was I supposed to know... they were dating? I don't think it's ever going to be the same again. It was Richie. It was Richard. It was Richie. I'm just a regular guy trying to do the right thing. But most times, the right thing always ends up badly. - Are you kidding? - No I'm not playing. Well, you look really handsome in this shirt I got for you. Thank you... - What would you do without me? - I don't know... - Oh... Speaking of being with you... - Yeah? - Let me get this... - Okay... Attention everybody... Attention... So... Jane Ifeoma Odogwu, I've thought of every possible way that I could show you how much I love you... And I couldn't think of anythng better than doing this in the presence of everybody here today. - Jane... - Oh...! Will you marry me? No! No... I can't! I can't! Excuse me... Mickey! Mickey! Mike! Mickey! Mickey! Mike! - Mike! - Hmm? Yeah? Uhm... Didn't you hear your phone ringing? Uhm... I... I was just... just lacing my shoes... Babe, are you all right? Uhm... I'm fine... I'm good. Look, if... If it's about this trip, I don't have to go with you, you know? I can just wait here, and you can go ahead. No, it's fine... I would really like for you to come on this trip with me. - Okay... - Yeah... Is everything all right? Diane, I... Like I said, I would really love for you to come on this trip with me... Ade is like my brother. He's practically family... And Lola is really really cool. I'm very sure you'll like her. It would be really nice to have you at this dinner with me. Look... I know it's important to you... and... it's just... The thing is, I don't know these people. Don't you think it's wiser if I wait until the wedding itself? No, no, no... Ade asked me to be his best man.. And it would be amazing to have you there with me. - If you say so. - I do. All right, so I'm just going to go and finish packing. All right, so I'm just going to go and finish packing. Okay. Okay. - Stop acting weird. - Okay. What? Uhm... Nothing. - Hey... What's up? - What's up bro? I'm good... Okay, great. What time is your flight? Uhm... It's for 2:00 PM, so we're packed and about to take off to the airport. Okay, cool. Just wanted to confirm what time your flight leaves Abuja so I know what time to send the driver over to you. Well, we should get there give or take, 4:00 PM, so he should be at the airport for 3:30. All right, cool, then. I'll have him wait for you there. I'll text you his number so you can call him once you land. All right, cool, then. I'll have him wait for you there. I'll text you his number so you can call him once you land. No wahala. Ade... I will be coming over with somebody. No wahala. Ade... I will be coming over with somebody. Chick, right? Don't worry, when I see you we'll talk about it. Haha... Bad guy... All right, I'll be waiting. No problem. All right, take care man. No problem. All right, take care man. All right, bro. Have a safe flight, yeah? I'll see you soon. All right, bro. Have a safe flight, yeah? I'll see you soon. Was that Mike? Yeah... Needed to confirm what time his flight leaves Abuja. What are you doing? How do you mean? I'm trying to call Richie. Why? What do you mean “why”? He's my friend and colleague and I think he should be at the dinner, since he's one of my groomsmen. I thought you told me this was a private dinner, with Mike and your parents. So how does Richie fit into the arrangement? Babe I know you don't like Richie, but... He is not responsible. He is a bad influence. He's still my friend and the only colleague I hang out with. Employee... Hmm? All right, I know Richie has his thing going on and all, but come on... I've got you so what harm could he possibly do to me? You know what? Since it's your call, just do whatever you want. I love you too. - Hey, homie... - Dude what's up? Man... I'm good... Don't tell me you're still sleeping. I just got in this morning... The club last night was crazy, man... Mr. Turn-up! Anyways, try to be at my place later today for 7:00 PM. Lola and I are hosting my best man this weekend so we are having dinner at my place. My parents will even stop by. Ok... What's his name again? - Mike. - Yeah... Mike... - So just try and be around for 7:00. - All right... I'll be there. - Thanks, bro. See you, then. - Yeah, sure. Hey, baby... Yeah, yeah, yeah... I'm sorry, okay? Something really important came up last night. Yeah, you know what? Can we reschedule for tonight? Yeah, my place. I'll pick you up in the evening. How's that? All right, sure. - Hey, baby... - Hey... How're you doing? - Mickey! What's up bro? - Hey! Good to see you! How's it going? Come inside... - Hi! - Hey! You guys finally get to meet. - Hi... - Nice to meet you! Wow... I've heard so much about you. Mike, Lola. Lola, Mike... My brother, friend and all around great dude. Ah, don't mind him... Honestly, like, seriously, they couldn't separate... Oh! Uhm... Sorry, my bad... Diane, this is Ade, and Lola. - Hi. - Hi. Hello... Welcome. Pleasure meeting you. - Hi... - Hi! - Ade... - Diane... - It's... It's a pleasure. - Same here. Nice place! Really spacious! Oh, yeah... Pre-wedding gift from popsi. Thought to bless me with this one. - Wow! Really? - Yeah... This place is huge! I like it. Let's show them in... Yeah, let's show you guys inside... Do a tour of the house... Yes... Come inside... Yes, yes... Please take it upstairs... - Okay... - Yeah... So let's give you guys a tour of the house, show you to your rooms. All right. So Ade, how is momsi, by the way? She's fine. She's been on my case since we started this arrangement. - Really? - Yeah... Wow... Your place is really nice and spacious. Thank you... You know popsi... He goes really hard when he wants to. Congrats again, man. Congratulations... Happy for you... Thanks... Are you all right? Uhm, yeah... Congratulations... You do have a lovely place. Thank you. - Let's show you guys around. Come on. - All right. - Would you not like to taste? - Oh... Uhm... It looks really great. - I hope Mike likes seafood. - Yeah... He does... - Table don set, Sarah? - Yes, ma'. - Would you like to help me? - Of course! Absolutely. Mr. Boyo! - How's it going bro? - Good, good. Yeah... They're all here... Like, can't wait for you to meet them. - Dude, man you're getting fat... - You're crazy, man! What is going to happen when you get married? Dude, meet Mike. Mike, Richard. - Mike and I go way back from Primary...? - Primary 6, actually. You guys had just moved into the estate, then. Yeah, yeah... I always picture my KC days alone. Yeah, so Richie here works with the telco arm of the company and he's my buddy and a major, major asshole. We practically do everything together. - Don't mind the idiot. - I won't. - He talks about you all the time. - Really? - Nice to finally meet you. - Same here. Now I see why you picked him as your best man. I'm sure he has his reasons, man, come on... - He doesn't like competition... - Yeah... Finally the food is ready, guys. I'll grab the wine. All right. - Mike, still your preferred dry red, right? - Yeah, yeah, dry red. - Hey Lola... - Richie... Hey... I don't believe we've been introduced. No, we haven't. And you will not be introduced because she came here with someone. Lola, why are you on my case this evening? I'm only trying to make a harmless introduction. - Hi... - She's Diane, by the way. See? That wasn't so difficult, was it? Hi, Diane. It's a pleasure to meet you. My name is Boyo. Richard Boyo. But you can call me Richie. Diane... Have we met before? I mean, because you look kind of familiar. - No, we haven't. - Are you sure? Richie! Can you please mind your business and stop harassing my guest? I'm just trying to be nice. I have a dry red, and a white. All right, I'm hungry. Shall we eat? Say a prayer first. Thank you Lord for this meal. - Thank you Lord for friends... - Thank you... Thank you Lord for Lola. Amen. Amen. - Thank you baby. - Amen to that. Merlot, my favorite red. - Mike? - Yeah... - Very little... That's fine. - All right. Guys? Why didn't you pick your call? Oh, Uhm... It cut off before I could answer it... Besides, it was a private number. - Oh... - Yeah... There you go... - Some sauce, please? - Yes... Ok... Thank you... Thank you. - Cheers, guys. - Cheers. So, how are the arrangements coming? Good... Momsi wants it to be a societal thing... So she's having her friends fly in from all over the world. I can imagine. Meanwhile, how is Funke? It's been a while. Oh, yeah... She's good. She was here a couple of weeks ago with her husband. You know, she now heads the media arm of the company. - Wow! Really? - Yeah... Yeah! That's true... I think I read something about that in the papers a while ago. That was about a year ago or so... Yeah, some time in April last year. - April, or something, yes... - Hmm, okay. So, Ade, what's the market like at the moment? Business is good. I mean, we own the biggest outdoor ad agency at the moment. Plus we just launched our online marketing digital platform. - Really? - Yeah. Wow... But I'm guessing that the numbers must be really low o voice calls lately. Yes, it has... Compared to what it was before, yes... A whole lot of people now are communicating over social media, instant messengers... Using data of course, because it's way cheaper for them. But we're just focused on driving data. Yeah... Because all the CMA networks that just jumped in at the time just filled it up. Yeah... Yeah, actually, about that... You see, what happened was that they didn't have the proper infrastructure to fit their business model. And second, the competition between those GSM was very stiff. Those guys didn't stand a chance Then again, that's because they decided to focus on areas without GSM coverage... I mean, they were looking to compete for numbers with bigger firms. Here's what I think. I think that we have the numbers, okay? I think we have the consumer population. So there's more than enough room for competition. But not on this turf. Once you have a weak start, you get easily crushed or run out of business. So if you have to play at all, you have to come big, or you'll just disappear as quickly as you launched. Yeah that's the difference between TV and telcos. I mean all sorts of small platforms are springing up everyday and they're focused on their own market base, or consumer base. While the big ones are just there, chasing after their audience. That's the thing, you see. With these guys, they have a target audience and market but for telcos that's not the case. Can we stop talking about market demographics for telcos and TV networks? What else do you want us to talk about? We're just catching up on work. Well, we can always do that after dinner. There's plenty of time. I'm sorry, my bad. I'm the one who started the talk. It's okay... Did I mention her father owns a media buying agency? Really? Which one? - Orion. - Wow! One of the firms we acquired. I'm... sorry... I'm sorry... That was loud... - Uhm... - Are you okay? Yeah... Uhm... Yeah... Yes... Yes... Everything is fine. Please excuse me. So, Lola... How did you meet this block of cement? Oh, yeah... Well... Hey... Well, we've had our fights and now, we're here. Well, he has his issues but it's nothing I can't deal with. Okay... So my boy becomes a man. I'm so proud of you, man. Thanks, bro. Yeah, nice one. So... Diane... Yeah... I'm sorry... Sorry guys. It's my dad. Dad? Richie. I'm here with my boyfriend. He's sitting right there. So? What do you mean by that? What difference does it make? It makes all the difference in the world. What is this? What you and I had was a one-time occurence, okay? That's it. Don't you ever wonder why I never picked your calls? How is that relevant? Oh it's very relevant, because, you see, I'm not about to ruin a good thing that I have going... which is absolutely amazing, because of one mistake, that happened one night, a very long time ago. Okay, so first thing: it was not a mistake. Second, stop acting like it was years ago. It was just last year. Feels like yesterday. I remember the way you moaned and how your lips taste... Stop it. Stop it. You really need to stop touching me. Be honest. Tell me you've never thought about that night. You said it yourself. It was the best sex you had ever had. More like the best mistake I ever made. At least it was the best something. Okay, you know what? Let's do this: How about me and you get together one last time? For old times' sake. - Richie? - Hm? It will never happen. - Hi... - Hi... Hey... - Hey... Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. You've been gone for a while... What happened? I had to use the bathroom. Plus, I was on the phone with my mom. - Oh, yeah. How is she? - She's fine... Okay... Excuse me guys, I'll be right back. - Hey babe... - Hey... Dude, what's up? Babe... Are you sure you're okay? Uhm... I'm fine, baby. I mean... You've been acting very uncomfortable. I hope it's not awkward for you being here because Ade and Lola are really cool people. Okay? You should try and relax. Nothing. What do you mean nothing? What were you guys doing in here or talking about? Nothing. Really? - Okay. What's up with that your guy? - What's up with him? - Okay. What's up with that your guy? - What's up with him? - Yeah. What's his name? Mikey? - Yeah... - Yeah. What's his name? Mikey? - Yeah... - That his babe, Diane... - Yeah? - Man... I've tapped that ass before. - Holy... So did you enjoy your meal? Had a fantastic time. Thank you so much for having us, Lola. We'll come over for a visit when you guys are married. Fantastic. We are looking forward to having you guys over again. So, Diane. Would you like to join me in the kitchen so we leave the guys to do their men talk? - It's okay. - Uhm, sure... - Please help me grab anything you can. - Okay. - You're kidding. - No, man. Sometime last year. And dude, that was the best... You know what's funny? I was about to ask how serious they were before popsi called. From the moment they walked in, I've been trying to figure out what the story was... Because if they're in a serious relationship I have to find a way to tell him that I've done her before. Or completely avoid letting him know. - You've done her before? - Shh!! - And you're there acting as if you don't know her! - Shhh!!!! I have to make this... There's no way Lola can find out about this. She will freak out. She'll kill you. You expect me to start telling my best man I've done his girlfriend before, in front of her? Come on. For 3 months, the whole thing was I was in and out of the country. She couldn't handle it so she had to cut it off. Like... I dated... I slept with her the same night we met. I took her down the same night I met the chick. What chick? Uhm... Some chick I met at the bar. Guy, take it easy, oh... Speaking of which, I think that let me show you guys the pool side... Or we should probably take the drinks out there and talk some more? That would be great. And a chance to see the rest of the house. Okay, sure. I'll bring the drinks over. Oh... After you. Dinner was lovely. Thank you. It's Sarah. That girl is so good. She saves me from a lot. So... what's up with you and Richie? How do you mean? Just exactly how I mean. What is up with you and Richie? Have you guys met before? Look, I couldn't quite read your messages, but I kept noticing the back and forth going on between you two. Uhm... It's a long story, Lola. You wouldn't understand. Try me. Hey, is this seat taken? May I? Let me guess. You're here all by yourself, pissed off about something and you're trying to clear your head. Hmm? Hey... Are you crying? Oh, wow... Hey, don't cry... Don't cry... What's wrong? Sorry, sorry, uhm... My name is Richie. What's your name? Hey, darling, you really need to stop crying. Could you at least tell me what your name is? - I'm so sorry about this... It's embarrassing. - It's fine... - Uhm... Diane. My name is Diane. - Okay... It's a pleasure to meet you, Diane. What's wrong Diane? Talk to me. Hey, you really need to talk about this. Yeah... I'd rather not. If you don't talk, you know you're just going to continue like this all night. It's not going to be fun, now, is it? What is going on? You know what? Let's do this. How about I buy you another drink, then you can talk to me about it. My mom says I'm a really good listener. Deal? Okay. Let's get two shots of tequila. Yeah? Okay. - So, do you live around here? - No, I stay in Abuja. Oh... What are you doing in Lagos? Oh... The problem is in Lagos. Boyfriend? What happened? Hey... - We just broke up. - Oh, wow... That's tough. But hey... Cheer up. I mean, you can't... You really can't keep going on like this all night. That's not going to be any fun. You really should stop crying, Diane. I mean, it's not like it's the end of the world. Is it? You know what would be the end of the world to me? Do you want to know? My idea of the end of the world, is coming into a bar, I look around, and I can't see one single pretty woman like you to talk to. That would be the end. See? Finally! She smiles. That was ridiculous. Okay. Here we go. To bad relationships and much, much better ones in the future. - You are something else. - Wait until the party starts. See? That wasn't so hard. Ah, that's good. - So? - So... That's how I met him. And then, what next? Uhm... how? Come on... I didn't see him again after that night. But he kept calling. I guess I sensed the kind of person he was, and I just didn't want to get dragged into anything with him, so I avoided him and... He wouldn't stop calling... And sending messages... You know... But I never responded to any of them. - Then eventually they stopped. - Yeah... Until I ran into him... I ran into him in your living room... Oh... Look... I am here. And I'll make sure that Richie doesn't do anything stupid tonight while you're here. Just kidding, but you'll be all right. You'll be fine. - How crazy can this night get? - It's crazy... - So... You and Michael... You're dating? - Yeah. You know, I've been through a lot of terrible relationships. I mean I almost added Richie to that list. God! But... But Mike... Mike, he's... he's the best. He's focused and he knows what he wants... And he's a hardworking human being and sweet and everything that I want right now, you know... - And it's so hard to find good men. - I know. I just... I don't know how he's going to take this when he finds out. It's going to crush him. Look... All of this happened before you met him. So it doesn't matter. And besides, Richie has no business in your relationship. Just so we're clear, everything we discussed in here tonight, will not get to Mickey, not even one word. You can trust me. - Thank you for listening. I appreciate it. - Anytime. - Him again? - Yeah. Man, Ade... Super proud of you, man. Becoming a man. Congratulations. Thanks, bro. But hey! That doesn't take out the funk in me. So Richie. What's your story? You have a girlfriend? Women... Women are all liars and cheats. They're all full of bullshit. Why would you say that? Because it is what it is. And on what percentage would you base this your... argument? 100 % One bad relationship isn't enough for you to tag every woman a liar and a cheat. Who said anything about one bad relationship? Even if you've had a few bad relationships, that's not enough reason for you to say all women are liars and cheats. Well... Until they prove me wrong. Richie, listen. Lola and I have been dating for quite a while now and soon to get married. Yes, we've had our ups and downs, our fights and our arguments... But I can tell you for a fact that she has not lied to me, how much more thought of cheating on me. Why, because we both know where we're headed. What? She is also a liar and a cheat? Listen, Richie... I know what it feels like to love and be heartbroken. But I got over it. Matter of fact, I got turned down on a marriage proposal once. But here's the thing: that doesn't mean that every woman out there is a liar and a cheat. I know for a fact that there are a lot of good women out there. You just need to go out and discover them for yourself. Every woman... Every girl... Every female... is a liar and a cheat. So, safe to say that your mother is a liar and a cheat? Who knows? I mean, I wasn't there when she was dating my father. I don't know what she did before they got married. Or even after they got married. Wait, let me get this right. So... You think that all unmarried women are liars and cheats or just women in general? Even married women. Come on, dude, now, come on... That's taking it too far. - What? - Come on... You think married women don't cheat and lie about it? It doesn't mean that there aren't some married women who cheat and lie, but you're generalising. Okay... Prove me wrong. Do you guys know why I'm still single? Let me guess. Because you're a dog? As are you my man... As are you. Here we go... You invest so much in a relationship. Your time, your energy, your money, your emotions... You sacrifice so much... And then one day, you're going through your girlfriend's phone or something... and you find out that the guy that she has been claiming is her friend or her cousin is fucking her. Oh... That's not all. You see... That same guy, you will see him in your house... At your parties... On the street... You go over, and you shake his hand... But what you don't know is that that same guy, every time you kiss your girl, you're actually tasting his dick. What the hell? Come on... Ah... Man... You know, that's not even the worst part. When you finally confront her, she will have the nerve to lie about it. Bullshit! Bullshit! Listen, shit happens. True story. But I refuse to accept the fact that all women are liars and cheats. I refuse to accept this as a fact. Richie... Do you know how many married women I've slept with? Do you know how many of them lie to their husband with my dick in their mouth? Ah, guys... I have seen shit and I have been through shit. And there is one thing I can tell you. All women are liars. All of them. I mean, I know that these things do happen, okay? But that doesn't mean, I repeat... That every woman is a liar and a cheat. I mean, I'm sure that you must have been unfortunate to mix with all the wrong sorts of women. But trust me when I say that there are good girls out there. - Besides, people change. - True. What? You guys haven't heard? You can never turn a bad girl good. And once a good girl goes bad, she's gone forever. Do you know how manya ssholes like me are out there, trying to mess up your good girl's life? And then what? And then the good girls ends up being the girlfriend or wife of the good guy, After some asshole has finished messing up her life. And you end up managing the damage. The truth is: I'd rather be the asshole than the good guy. I'd rather be the guy with the D, than the one who's swallowing the D. Because actually, good guys always finish last. Dude man, your mid is warped. You need God. Honestly, you need help. Say what you want, but that's the truth and even you know it. I mean, I know we don't really like to think about it, but how many of us can really vouch for our girls? How many of us? I mean, even Lola. Do you know how many guys she was with before you? Well yeah, they've... had their lives before now and all, But even at that, they want better. And most times, they turn out better than their earlier years. Lola and I, we've sat down and we've talked about our pasts, And we're willing to move forward beyond our pasts, with love. - Really? - Yes, really. - What? - Nothing. Richie, it's unfortunate that you've mixed with all the wrong people and they've warped your perception about everything. You seriously need change in your social circles. All right, sweetie. I'll talk to you tomorrow then. Better have the prices of my goods ready. Good night. Hey... Do you know where Michael is? - Just here, over at the pool. - Oh, okay. Than you. - Are you okay? - Uhm, yeah... I'm fine. All right, darling. I'm sure you'll like it there. The truth of the matter is, no matter how you may argue your facts, or whatever you want to call it, Richie, You cannot state categorically that this thing you're saying about women is true. What I think you should do is find yourself a nice woman, settle down and live responsibly. That's all. - Mike? Abi? - Bottom line, actually. - Hey babe. - Hey. Could you move your jacket, please? Are you okay? You seem a bit... I don't know... I'm fine. - You sure? - Yeah. So how long have you two been together for? Us? No, me. Of course I'm talking about you. Well, about 11 months to a year. About a year. So how would you define your relationship? How do you mean? Wait... Do you guys really know each other? Are you faithful to each other? Richie... Diane and I have been dating for about a year. And I can categorically tell you that we know each other well enough and we're faithful to each other. We have our differences every now and then, but we work through them. So because you'e been together for 11 months... or a year... You think you know everything there is to know about each other? Richie, at some point you have to find a woman you love... At least someone that loves you too... And that you can live with. Then you can settle down. Don't mind Richie. Guys like this... When he falls in love, he's going to be a sucker for love. This one? Just leave him. So you think I'm still in denial? Yeah... Whatever. So I suggest we focus on the reason why we're here, which is to celebrate life... love... and happiness. So, guys... A toast. May this day bring us all the blessings, and more. - Cheers - Hear, hear... - Excuse me. I'll be right back. - Okay. Come on, Mike... Come on, Mike... Mike and I... We're in love. And he means a lot to me. But then, I guess he knows that. - Ah... - Oh, there he is. Hey, Mike. Diane was just telling us about you guys... Diane I need to speak with you. Mike, is everything ok? Everything is fine, I just need to have a word with her. Are you cheating on me? - No, Mike, I wouldn't... - You're such a piss-poor liar! So you would cheat on me and lie to my face about it even when I have proof? - Mike... I can explain... - Explain what? That you're having an affair with someone you're planning to see later tonight, even though you're her with me? Jesus Christ, Diane! What the hell are you thinking? - Baby, it is not what you think at all... - Then what is it? What is it? What is it, Diane? Mike, please calm down... Please. - Please, just calm down... - I'm calm! What is it? - Stop... You're yelling... - Who cares if I'm shouting? - Mike... - No, No... Who cares if I'm shouting? Mike... Mike, what's the problem? Ade, please.. Please, just let me handle this. Come on, Mike... What's the problem? Why are you behaving... I'm not even screaming... Five minutes. Please... Okay? Five minutes. Mike, calm down... Was that... Was that why you put your phone on vibrate and left it in the room, so I wouldn't know when he calls you? Mike... I just knew that there was something going on the minute you started acting weird! - It's not what you think... - Then what is it? What is it? What, you can't talk anymore? What? Them? You can't talk in front of... They're my friends, you can say anything in front of them. We'll just... give you guys a minute. They're gone now, so you better start talking, Diane. Who is he? Mike, it's... - Oh you're crying now? - It's a long story... I... It's something that we need to sit down and talk about. I don't have time to sit down with you, Diane, and talk. So if you have something to say, you better start saying it right now, or I swear to God I'm going to do something we're both going to regret. - Mike... Mike, it was just... - Who is he? Who is he Diane? Oh you're crying now? You think that's the solution to the problem? Who the fuck is he Diane? - Baby, please... - Don't... Call me that... - Mike, don't do this... Please... - Who is he? Who is he, Diane? Who is he?! Richie... - What? - Richie... What the hell is a Richie? - Please, this was before... - Oh my God, no... No... No, Diane, no... Why...? - Babe, it was... - Shh!! - Please listen to me... It was before we met... - Shh!!! - Mike, Mike... Mike... - No, let me talk to this guy... - Who the hell do you think you are? - Mike, calm down... What makes you think that you can do this kind of shit and get away with it? - Mike, relax... - Let me talk to this guy... Mike, you're here for me, not for this. Calm down. - Baby, please, let's just talk... - Shut up! Shhh! Mike, I beg you, whatever it is, we can sit down and talk about it like adults... Come on... Don't ruin my day. I invited you here for a reason. Ade, I'm not trying to ruin your day... I'm just trying to talk to this guy and find out who the hell he thinks he is that he can do this kind of shit and get away with it. Mike, Mike, Mike... I beg... Please just calm down... Let's talk about it... See... Let's talk it through... Mike, come on... Mike... Come... Talk to me... Come, Mike... Don't do this. Mike, calm down, calm down... No, guy... I dey play... Let me just... No... Just a second... Let me just talk to him, just one second... Let me just... Mike, calm down! Calm down, Mike... What do you want to do? - Really? Mike, calm down! - Let me show him what I'm going to do! Don't mind him! Leave him! Mike... Mike, you don't have to prove anything! Just calm down... Let's talk... Mike, let's talk... Let's talk... - Please... Please, don't do this... - Let's talk... Let's talk, Mike. Calm down. - Mike, please... - Calm down... Point proven, man... Really? - Oh my God! Mike! - Ah!!! Mike! Stop! Richie! What the fuck? What's this? What's wrong with you guys? What's this? I invited you here for my dinner! Not for this! what's wrong with you guys? Why are you ruining my night? What the fuck is wrong with you? Mike! Mike! - Richie stop! - Both of you! What's wrong with the two of you? Why are you always like this? You just ruin everything! Mike. Please! Please! - Mike... Are you okay? - Don't... come near me! Please... Now I see why Lola didn't want you in the first place. Because all you do is ruin things. Just one simple dinner and you couldn't hold it together. You couldn't help yourself, right? Ruin things? Like you're any different. Spare me that self-righteous bullshit. Don't even go there... Don't go there, Richie. Go where? The fact that you're a hypocrite acting like a saint? Now I see why no one wants to hang out with you. Because all you do is cause pain and chaos. There's just no normal with you. Ade, it's about me now? It's about me? You just had to prove a point, right? Prove what? - You just had to prove a point... - Prove what point? Look you don't get to live in your world and talk to me as if you know anythign about me or my life. Don't go there... Don't go there, Richie... Don't go there... Don't! Daddy's little boy, living in some protected fantasy castle with your father paying for everything... and you think you're better than me? Yes, I fucked your girl. But you want to know what's funny? Your saint of a friend here fucked her too. First point proven! And you... Why don't you ask your little tramp of a fiancee how she liked me fucking her? Second point proven! Ade! Ade, stop! Mike, leave me! Leave me alone! You! Ade... - Mike, wait... wait... - What is it? What do you want to say to me? Yeah... I thought so too... Mike... Mike, I love you... I love you so much and I... You are the most important thing in my life... I swear, all of this... This happened before we met. I just... How was I supposed to tell you? I just wanted the right time to tell you. What point was the right time to you? No, tell me. What time was right to you? I've had so many bad experiences with men, and you know most of it. And... I made a stupid mistake, okay? It was just... Ever since you came into my life, my life has been brighter. I don't want to ruin this for anything, please... You don't get it, do you? You don't understand. The fact that you would withhold such information from me... Even when I noticed that there was something wrong and I asked you time and again, and again, and agin. The fact that you would sleep with my friend... My best friend... And his friend... That's a bit too much, Diane. So maybe this was all a mistake. Maybe we shouldn't be doing this in the first place. No, no.. don't say that... Baby please... - I'm done. - No! I... - I'm done. - No, Mike... I.. Listen, Mike... Babe, please, wait... Wait... You know, it makes sense to me now. The reason you don't like him around... The reason why you would not join conversations about him. - Because you were screwing him. - No... - It is not what you think? - Then what in God's name is it? Answer me. What? Ade... This happened because of you. Do you remember the day we had a fight, and you wouldn't even pick my calls? Richie? Ade? - Hey... - Where is he? Where is who? Don't act like you don't know what I'm talking about. Where is he? Ade? - Ade! - Hey, hey, hey! You can't just barge into my house like this. - Baby? - See why? Well, well... Is everything okay? Yeah everything is fine. Did you find what you were looking for? Yes, baby. I have. - Let me just go... - No, no it's fine. What's wrong, Lola? No, no, no... Hey, hey... Come on... Don't cry... Talk to me... It's Ade... I was trying to talk to him... He's not even picking my calls. He's not even letting me apologize. Relax... I understand... I understand... Everything will be fine... Are you very sure everything is okay? Yeah, everything is fine... - Uhmm... - Oh! All right, I'll see you next week, baby. Don't worry. You're in good hands. What did she mean, that I'm in good hands? Never mind. Come on... He won't even talk to me... Just have a seat... Have a seat... Are you okay? Talk to me. I called him. I apologized, I said I was sorry. But he's not even giving me a chance. And because I wasn't answering my phone, you thought we were together, right? - Ade... I... - What happened? Talk to me. You left your house at this time of the night to come see me, to come look for him. - Something terrible must have happened. - I've been trying to tell him I was sorry. I even called him many times but he's just been ignoring me and it's driving me crazy. I took antidepressants, they're not working. And he knows how I get when me and him are like this. And, like... I'm sure he'll come home, okay? I've called him as well. He's not answering my calls. I'm sure when he's ready, he'll call you. Don't cry... Are you sure you're fine? Come here... Everything is going to be fine, all right? Everything will be fine... You're such a shameless liar! The Richie I know wouldn't just stop at kissing you! Ade it happened only once! And the more you lie about this, the more pissed off I get! And don't even come up with your excuse of using antidepressants! So if you know what's good for you, you better start talking now! He wouldn't allow me to drive home alone that night because I was in no shape to do that, and we couldn't reach you on the phone. Hello Ade... I've been trying to reach you since last night. Well, I didn't want to be reached. Where are you? Hello? I'm at Rita's. I decided to stay back there since I couldn't get through to you. - We need to talk. - I know. - Where are you? - I'm at home - I'll be on my way - Okay. What happened, Richie? You know what. I know what happened. Why did you do it? What is funny, Richie? Okay. So you want to blame this on me? I've seen how you've been checking me out. I know when a woman wants me. “How I have been checking you out.” Richie how have I been checking you out? I am your best friend's girlfriend! You should at least respect that! No... You should have respected that. Richie, Richie, Richie... I was in no condition to drive... You saw that and you took advantage of me, Richie... Richie, you took advantage of me! I have to get to work. I hope you guys sort yourselves out. You know your way out. Ade... It happened with Richie just once... It was Richie's fault. He took advantage of me. I couldn't tell you because I didn't know how you would react. But, even you... - You had something to do with Diane. - Don't even go there. Diane and I was way before us! You know what... I can't... I can't go on with this. I'm calling off the wedding. Ade... Stop... Please... Please... You can stay the night, but I want you out by tomorrow. Ade, no... Ade, please! I didn't mean to... I need to talk about it... I thought I told you... Dude... You don't need to explain, okay? Shit happens. I'll deal with it. Mike, just hear me out. What do you want to tell me? That you slept with the woman I was going to get married to, and you didn't think that you should tell me... If for nothing else, for the respect you have for me as a friend? Bro, I... I was going to tell you. I was just looking for the proper time to. Bro... Tell me, bro... When was this going to happen? Yeah... Thought so too... Listen... It's no big deal, okay? It's done. I'll be out of here in the morning. I'm sure you can find someone else to take my place at the wedding. Just so you know, I called off the wedding. I'm not going through with it anymore. And for all it's worth, I... Your friendship means a lot to me... I'm never going to take that for granted. I'm really sorry about how things panned out here today and I take absolute responsibility for everything. I hope we can find time to sit down and talk before you leave. I hope you're happy with yourself and everything you've achieved today by trying to prove a point. Now I see why Lola didn't want to invite you in the first place. Even though she had her reasons... And then you just fuck things up like you always do. What? Am I wrong? I mean, take a freaking look at your life. You don't get to talk about my life. You know nothing about me. At least, I know not to leave a woman around you. I've been nothing but a true friend to you, no matter what you've been through. And this is how you repay me? No, really. What have I done to deserve this? That despite all your fuck-ups, I still cover up for you. I can take everything else... But this... No... This is sinfully evil. At least, if folks ask me, I can give them a good enough reason why I ended this... friendship, or whatever it was to you. You can leave my house. Hello mom... Daddy... Junior... What... What seems to be the matter? And who was that young lady driving off in a taxi? What lady? I saw a young lady drive off in a taxi with a set of suitcases. Must be Diane. Who is Diane? And why is she leaving your house with a set of suitcases at this time of the morning? Why do you have a black eye? Honey, do you have another girlfriend? Have you been fighting? And for crying out lound, why is Richard sleeping in your living room? Where is Lola? I think she's somewhere around the house. Seriously, why do you have a black eye? And... So... For goodness' sake, why is he snoring here? Adetunde George Jr, you will explain what went on here right this minute... Adetunde George Jr, you will explain what went on here right this minute... and you will do it now. And you will do it now. I'm calling off the wedding. What did you say? I said I'm not going through with the wedding. - Michael! - Michael? Good morning sir. Good morning ma. Michael what happened? Are you... Are you okay? I'm fine, ma. Adetunde, can you wake up this snoring friend of yours... and you explain what's going on here, right this minute! Ade, apparently we need to have a serious conversation with your son. Now, where is Lola? She had an affair with Richard. He tried to f... to have s... to sleep with my girlfriend. Under my very nose. It was a mistake. I was so vulnerable and... it just happened. I don't think I can trust her anymore. He pushed me away. I went all the way to look for him. He threw the first punch. If she can do this while we're engaged, what happens after we get married? And he betrayed the trust I had in him as a friend. I couldn't tell him because I didn't want to destroy everything we had built up until this point. How was I supposed to know they were dating? It happened a long time ago and I only found out that they're dating. I'm so ashamed of myself right now. And I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I don't think it's ever going to be the same again. I was going to propose to her. Now I can't even think of doing that. How do you sleep with your fiance's friend? I mean, how do you sleep with your best friend's girl... and not tell him? It was Richie. It was Richard. It was Richie. Richard... It seems that you have chosen to be a problem, not only to yourself... but to everybody around you. I will not sit here and watch you ruin my son's life... and future. Your father was a good man. But sometimes I wonder how he ended up with a child like you. I have tried to do my bit by making sure that you have a future... and a carreer. But no! This is how you choose to pay me? By ruining my son's life and plans? Richard... From this minute, you no longer work for my organization. And you are no longer welcome in any of the family activities, from today. You will clear your desk and turn in your resignation on Monday. Do I make myself clear? Yes sir. But you should know... You... So she made a mistake. She betrayed your trust. She had sex with another man. Let me ask you... Have you never had sex with other women? Hmm? Moving on. Have you ever asked yourself why she went to look for you in Richard's house? Because you failed to communicate And that is the biggest problem in most relationships. People fail to communicate. Junior, if you love somebody, no matter what the situation is... you listen to that perso and what he or she has to say. Yeah, you have a point there. I agree with that. I still don't think it's enough reason for her to sleep with her fiance's employee. Well, I understand that... But the point I'm trying to make is that okay, she hurt him. Hmm? So you call off the wedding. And then both of you move on. And what next? Hmm? You get some other girl and you start afresh. You rebuild to the stage where you are now. Maybe it takes you a year or two, in the state that you're in. And then, somewhere along the line, another revalation comes along. What do you do? Let me make it abundantly clear, right here, right now... There is no way I'll let my son marry some woman... who cannot control her sexual inhibitions. Adeleke... We all make mistakes. We all have our past that we are not proud of... But we also have a future that we can create together. We shouldn't let our past dictate what our future should be. Junior... Let me ask you something. Would you have called off this wedding if there wasn't any big revelation? - That is not the point. - So what is the point? - The point... - How could she sleep with Richard? Of all people? Wait a minute... Are you angry because she slept with Richard or because she slept with another man? Both. Would it have made a difference if she slept with some other guy? Ade what are you on about? Why should she be sleeping with anybody except him? Junior, would it have made a difference? It would have made a huge difference, darling. Okay... Would it have made a difference if she slept with some guy that you didn't know... and you never got to find out? Oh, don't worry your pretty little head because eventually, we always find out, now don't we? Oh well... The most important thing has already happened, okay? The big secret is out. You all have stripped yourselves naked just the way you are. But... The choice is yours... To move on, or to love her, regardless of her past. Or just... let her go. Uhm... I'm sorry, I need to borrow your keys. Wait a minute, we're not done with you yet. I know ma. I'm sorry, but I need his car keys to get to the airport and stop her from leaving. Ade... Ade, please I need your car keys. They're over there in the box. Thank you. I'll be right back sir, ma. Seriously? Okay. Oh man... crap! Crap! Oh no... - Good morning, officer. - Yes, good morning, sir. Is this your car? Uhm... yes... No... No, actually... It's my friend's car, officer. Okay, bring the papers, your driver's license and come down and open this booth. Okay, let me have your driver's license. I said come down and open this boot. Officer, actually that is a funny story... I actually dropped... forgot my driver's license when I was hurrying... you know... into the car... You forgot your driver's license? Yeah... And where are you going to? And why is your singlet stained with blood? I'm going to the airport to stop my friend from... you know... travelling. - I see. - Yes, officer. I said why is your singlet stained in blood? I... It's a funny story... I actually fell down... You know... when I was running into the car... Come down, come down! Come down and open this booth! Officer! Come and hold this... Come down and open this booth. Oh shit... shit... shit... What?! Hey! Shit... Shit... Move, move, move, move! Officer move this car! This guy is getting away! I no want make we miss am! Move this car! You no see the car weh them dey drive, oga? Wetin do the car? Na machine, oh! Attention, all passengers. This is boarding call for Arik flight NG 162. Lagos to Abuja. Please proceed to terminal for boarding. Arik Flight NG 162. Lagos to Abuja. Please proceed to gate for boarding. Hold on, hold on, hold it sir. Yes? What is the problem? I'm sorry sir. I just need to see someone real quick before they take off. Oh, sorry. That is not possible. No, no, no, you don't understand. It's very important that I see them before they go, sir. Sir, you can't go beyond this point without a boarding pass. Maybe it's your first time here. I'm begging you, please sir, just... Oga you no dey hear Oyinbo? Who be this? You can't go past this point without a valid ticket and a boarding pass. Yes. Please, I hope you are not here to create a scene. - No, I'm not sir... - Step aside. Step aside. Diane! Diane! Diane! Diane! Diane! Diane! What is Diane? Diane! Diane! Mike! What the heck are you doing? I'm sorry about everything. I'm so sorry. I just... I just want us to talk about this. Please can we talk about this? Can we work through this? Mike... I can't do this, Mike. I can't. Okay? I just... I have to go. I mean... Obviously I wanted this to work. That's why I came with you here. I wanted it to work but my past just keeps jumping out at me all the time. My mistakes have caught up with me and now I have to deal with myself. My mistakes have caught up with me and now I have to deal with myself. So I'm sorry, but I have to go. So I'm sorry, but I have to go. No, no, what are you talking about, Diane? I don't care about you past. I just... Yes, Yes, I said some things I shouldn't have said. Yes, Yes, I said some things I shouldn't have said. I judged you wrongly, without giving you the benefit of the doubt, yes... I judged you wrongly, without giving you the benefit of the doubt, yes... but I'm here now, trying to convince you to stay, so we can talk about this... so we can work though this. You're not listening to me Michael, okay? This is not even about you anymore, okay? This is about me. I need to just go, so I can work all of this out, okay? I need to figure out who I am, and... I can't do this, I'm sorry... Diane, Diane, Diane... Please just... Just stay... Just... Please... Don't go... please... I'm sorry, Mike. At least, don't go without this. Diane, I love you. I do. Sincerely. And I've thought about the perfect time and place for me to do this, but... it never just came up. I... Guy! Hurry up with the proposal, you're blocking the road! What? I didn't even imagine it would be like this. I've thought about the love that I had and I can't imagine my future without you in it. Diane, please... Marry me. Don't... Don't do this, Mike. Please, I... I can't deal with this, with everything else. Okay? I just... Diane... Diane.. Diane... My Mickey! Hey! What's going on? - Good to see you, bro. - Good to see you too. Man, congrats, on your engagement. Thank you very much, and thank you for hosting us. Ah, it's nothing... Who would have thought, that you would get married before me? In this life, Mike? I know, but I mean, here we are. Yeah, we are, I guess... Yeah, thanks for everything. How is everything? You looks sharp. Thank you. Yeah, and... how is she? Where is she? Uhm... Speak of the devil... - Hi! - Hello! - You look gorgeous. - Thank you. - Congratuations. - Thank you, again. Hey baby... So! Shall we? Yes, we shall. Absolutely. Yes, but you said you were going to get something real quick? - Oh, yeah, on our way out... - Oh okay... Oh guys, sorry, please give me a second. I need to take this call. - Oh okay... - Sure, yeah... Hello? Nice one. I'm really happy. How are you holding up? Well, what can I do, bro? I've moved on. When last did you speak to her? Who? Or, Lola? Bro, I don't know... I really have moved on. Moved on to where? At least I now know I can feel free to get myself a new squeeze whenever I please. Getting yourself a new squeeze is exciting Ade, but trust me bro, that ain't love. At least I don't have to deal with trust issues. So you would much rather deal with a new girl in your house every night? Do you miss her? - Well, I... I do, but... - But it hurts to forgive. Listen Ade. A couple months back, I was going to be your best man. But today, here you are, trying to be my best man. That night taught me one thing. It showed me the kind of man I want to be. Ade, you need to do the right thing. Okay? You need to do the right thing. Yeah. Uhm... Welll... That wasn't so bad. Well, it's a start. I know that I'm probably the last person you were expecting to see tonight. But... Diane and Mickey told me that... Do you think it would be all right if we got together again and maybe talked things over? Or probably even restart all over? Who would have thought? Thought what? That... You know... We would be the ones to bring them together. Who would have thought that I would create a scene at the airport after fleeing the police... With a bloody shirt, a swollen face and no shoes? Love makes us do the most ridiculous things. I know. I love you. I love you. You care to join us out? Sure. After you. Okay... Right! Let's do it. Hey, babe...
