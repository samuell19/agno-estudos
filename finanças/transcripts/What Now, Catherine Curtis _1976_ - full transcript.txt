[music playing] - Once upon a time there was a girl. She got married, had two beautiful daughters, a house in the suburbs, and a husband, who played around. And so after 23 years of marriage, she is getting a divorce. This is the story of that girl, Catherine Curtis, who for the first time in her life, is alone. - Who are you, Catherine Curtis? Who the hell are you? For the last 23 years, I haven't lived one minute alone with you. I don't know you. I'm in a new apartment with a stranger. Wait a minute. I remember you. The last time we met, you were 17. You had long, reddish hair and pennies in your loafers and a padded bra. There wasn't a line on your face. And you used to play and laugh and sing, and you thought the whole world was a party in your honor. I'd better call the children. Hello, Melinda. This is mother. This is mother. Oh, sorry. Was I shouting? Oh, well, I'm fine, dear, just fine. As a matter of fact, I just called to tell you how really fine I am. Oh, and I wanted to give you my new phone number. Gramercy 5 5525. Now, write it down, dear. 525, that's right. Oh, don't you worry about me, honey. I'm really getting it together. Getting it together. Oh, baby, I'm sorry. I completely forgot about your finals. Well, you go back to your studying and just don't forget my new number that's-- bye. Bye, darling. Now, why the hell did I do that? What's the matter with me? I'm a grown woman. I'm perfectly safe. Nobody is hurting me. I'm warm and comfortable in a beautiful, new apartment. Why can't I be alone for two minutes without picking up the receiver and dialing like some kind of crazy woman? This is ridiculous. This is a telephone, not an umbilical cord. And this is my home. I didn't come here to make phone calls. I came here to live, and it's too damn dark in here. Lamps. One lamp. Hello. This. Oh, you're heavy. Oh, my god. Lamp shades. One lousy lamp shade. Oh, that's better. [sighing] Oh, big deal. Oh, Melinda, baby. look at that face. There you are, sweetheart. Hello, Elizabeth. Well, now I may sound prejudiced, but I think you're a knockout in that bathing suit. And why not? You've got your mother's legs. You bum. You really had it made, didn't you, Ben? A perfect arrangement. You stashed a wife in the country with two kids and a Veg-O-Matic, while you worked late every night in fun city, trying to fight off old age with a hair transplant and a bottle of Maalox. You know what you are, Ben? You're a 54-year-old Mouseketeer. Catherine, we'll move to Connecticut. You'll love the country. Well, I hated the country, Ben. I hated the crabgrass. I hated the mulch. I hated the compost heap, and I hate you, Bennett Curtis. Damn you! You were never around when we needed you. If it wasn't working late, it was some out-of-town, rotten business trip. Like the time Elizabeth broke her arm and I tried to call you in Boston. 4 o'clock in the morning and you weren't in your room. I called again at 5:00 and 5:30. 6:00. When you finally answered at 7:30. The only thing you could tell me was, I didn't hear the phone. I was in the shower. Some shower, three and a half hours. Only takes an hour to wash an airplane. Oh, my god. [sighing] Why then? Why? Why all those other women? When we first got married, you couldn't keep your hands off me. Nothing turned you off, not even curlers and Noxzema. When did it change? OK. OK. I'll admit I wasn't always a bundle of passion. Maybe I could have improved in that department. It's just that some day, being a housewife and a mother and a gardener and a plumber got to be a bit much. Up at 6:30. Breakfast for the kids. Oh, gee, oatmeal again? Mommy, Mommy, Melinda spilled oatmeal all over me. Blah. And dress the kids for school, and it's snowing, yet. Put on mufflers and mittens and earmuffs and galoshes and zip the snowsuit all the way up. Now, you have to go to the bathroom? Huh. Oh, then started Catherine's 24-hour limousine service. Drive the kids to school, drop you off at the station. At least I thought it was you, Ben, but I wasn't sure. You didn't take your face out of "The New York Times" for three years. Then the rest of the day was drive me here, drive me there. Everybody forgot how to walk. Then back to the station to pick you up. And sometimes you weren't there, and I waited, and I waited. Do you know how many romantic dinners I watch shriveled to death in the oven waiting for you to come home? You really hurt me, Ben. Not so much your young chicks. But you had no style. You flaunted it. You let everybody see you. Everybody knew but me. You did an unforgivable thing, Ben. You made people feel sorry for me. Well, is this it, Catherine? This is how it's going to be for the rest of your life? You're just going stay here, die of terminal self pity? You're a big girl, Catherine. Stop wallowing. You heard me, wallowing! I don't care what Ben did to you. It's not half as bad as what you're doing to yourself. Now get off your can and get some life and energy and joy and music into this place. [MUSIC - KEELY SMITH, "ONE LESS BELL TO ANSWER"] One less man to pick up after. I should be happy, but all I do is cry. - Oh, you're a big help. [music] All right, now. All right, now. Keep moving, Catherine. When you're moving, you're not thinking. When you're not thinking, you're not hurting yourself. Where shall I start? What the hell difference does it make? Oh, there you are. Well then. That's better. That's good. Now, then, other lamps. I'm going to put one over there and maybe two lamps there. [non-english]. And a big, a big plant there. Lot of greenery in the window. A lot of greenery. And then I'll put the dive in-- I'll have to put the dive in here. I have no wall space. Then I'll get a coffee table, not too delicate a coffee table because I want people to be able to put their feet up and be comfortable. And I'll get that fireplace burning with real logs, nothing but real logs. And I'm going to get a few throw pillows. Maybe I'll buy some of those big squashy ones, so people could sit on the floor. And I don't want to live here anymore. I don't want to live any place. I just want to curl up and die. [sobbing] [phone rings] Hello. Oh, hello, Elizabeth. How is the baby? She said that? Those were the first words she learned? Put the little truck driver on the phone. Hello, Stacey, sweetheart. This is Nana. No. No, darling. Don't use those words. You'll have plenty of time to say that when you get a husband. I love you, honey. Put Mommy back on the phone. Elizabeth, you didn't take her to an x-rated film, did you? Well, she sounds wonderful. Elizabeth, I did not call to discuss that. But I don't want to go back to him. Stubborn? Me? I hung in there for 23 years, so don't call me stubborn. Masochistic maybe, but certainly not stubborn. Elizabeth, he really said that? I miss him too. Then I've missed him for the last 18 years. Look, do you know how many times he's promised that? Elizabeth, now listen, listen, darling, I just want to-- no, Elizabeth, I will not call him. I cannot go back to that. Yes, that's final. Final. Whoa! Oh, god! [sobbing] - Catherine Curtis survived her first night alone, and the night after that, and the next night, and the next week, and the months that followed, alone. Then she decided, enough. Today she was determined to bring that number up to two. - Hi, Miss Curtis! - Good morning, Mr. Slaney. - Good morning. - How are you feeling? - Oh, pretty good. Able to sit up. Take a little nourishment. - How's the weather out? - Huh? - How's the weather out? - Oh, pretty good. Weather man says it's going to burn off by noon. Also says the blue fish are running of Montauk. That's a very good sign when the blue fish are running off Montauk. There's a low pressure point at 200 millibars and a high pressure point coming in from Buffalo. - Would you care for some coffee, Mr. Slaney? - Love it! [singing] - Here we are. - Hey. Mrs. Curtis. - Yes? - Look at you. All snazzied up. - Oh, this. I've had it for years. - No kidding. Look terrific. - Do you really think so, Mr. Slaney? - Would I lie to you, Mrs. Curtis? - I hope so. - Thank you. - Nothing like a good, hot cup of coffee. One lump or two, sir? - Well, I'll take one lump and a little dash of the cow. - OK. There we are. Just a dash. Now, this is for you. - Oh. - And for me. Would you care for one? - Oh, they look delicious. They look good. - They're Napoleons. - What's he eating for breakfast? - Oh. Oh, you know you have a nice sense of humor, Mr. Slaney. - Oh, that. I've had that for years. I can't get over how good you look. What's happening to you today? - I really don't know yet. - Something special coming up? - Could be. Is your coffee OK? - Oh, boy. Tastes good. - You know, the secret is in the beans. I'd buy them fresh, and I grind them myself. They're from Colombia, South America. - You always go that far to shop? - Oh. There goes that sense of humor again. - Well, you've only got one life to live. - Oh, you never said a truer word. - Say, ah, Mrs. Curtis, I've been wanting to ask you. Have the neighbors been complaining about my hammering? - Oh, I wish they would. You know, I have lived here for three months, and I haven't met one of them. - Well, isn't that a crying shame? How people who share a wall can't even share a hello. - Very nicely put, Mr. Slaney. - Well, actually, it's not original. I heard Merv Griffin say it. - I'll bet he didn't say it as well as you did. - No, he didn't. You know something, Mrs. Curtis, when me and Grace, god rest her soul, lived in Regal Park, we knew every single person in our building. - That's very nice. - Yep. 1A, the Doyles, Tom and Emma. 1B, the Lufts, Wilhelm and Colleen. 1C, the Bubermans. - The Bubermans? - The Bubermans, Max and Florence. 1D, the Bubermans, Cye and Annie. 1E, the Bubermans, Frank and Sally. - That's a lot of Bubermans for one building. - Well, there were three Buberman brothers that lived in that building. They ran the Buberman foam rubber business. - Oh. Napoleon? - Napoleon was on the fourth floor. - That sense of humor again. [laughing] - I tell you, Mrs. Curtis, we were neighbors in the true sense of the word. There was love in our building, Mrs. Curtis. Love. - I'm sure there was. Mr. Slaney, ah, how long has it been since your wife ah-- - Died? - Yes. - You know, it was funny Mrs. Curtis, how people are afraid to use the word die. It's been three years, three years this June 17. - She must have been very nice. - Oh, yeah. Yeah, she was. We had a real good thing going for us. Oh, don't get me wrong. It wasn't one of those kissy-wissy, lovey-dovey romances. - No? - Oh, no. As a matter of fact, we screamed at each other pretty good. - You didn't? - Oh, yeah. Well, maybe not exactly a scream, but we did talk a lot at the top of our lungs. - Well, what did you fight about? - Oh, my shirts. The Giants. Egypt. - Egypt? - Oh, yeah. Didn't matter if we had something to say. We got it out. - Ben, my husband and I, never raised our voices to each other in over 23 years. - Honest to God? Well, how could you live like that? I mean, being married all those years, there's bound to be some aggravation that stores up inside of you. I mean, if you don't let it out, you could get herpes. - Or a divorce. - You ever threw anything at each other? You never screamed? - Oh, we lived in Westport, Connecticut. It was not zoned for screaming. - Oh. I mean, but when you went real crazy inside and boiling over inside, what did you talk about? - His shirt. The Giants. Egypt. Anything, but what was really bothering us. - Tell me, what was he like? - Well, he had charm, Mr. Slaney. I'll give him that. And the more scotch he drank, the more charming he got. Some nights he was so charming he couldn't even move. - Well, if that's the way it was, maybe you are better off living alone. - Maybe. - Hey, I better be getting back to work. - Oh, Mr. Slaney, tell me, what did your wife look like? - Well, actually, she looked a lot like me. - Like you? - Yeah. But on her, it came out OK. - Well now, don't you think that you're attractive, Mr. Slaney? - Well, I don't think I'm exactly Stanley Stunning, but so far, I've been able to keep out of the zoo. - I think you have a very handsome face. - You do? - Very handsome. - Thank you. - Tell me, do you think that I'm attractive, Mr. Slaney? - Oh, yes. Oh, yes, Mrs. Curtis. I think you're a very good-looking woman. - Did you say that just because I said that you were handsome? - Oh, no. Your good looks has nothing to do with my good looks. I ah, look at the time. I'd better get cracking. - Oh, no. Let me freshen your coffee. - No, I really don't want any more coffee. I had enough. - Look, I made this just for you. - I want you to enjoy it. - Delicious. Grinding them beans is what does it. - Yeah, well, that's the way my grandmother used to do it. - Well, grandma knew. I think that all my grandmas know everything because the old ways are the old ways and the best way as far as I'm concerned. She knew. God bless grandma. Yes, sir. Give me the old ways every time. I mean, people today with their speed and their instants and their jiffies and their speedies, and it's getting crazy with a shake a bakes and your bake a shakes and your minute mix and your quicky mix and your ready mix and your here a mix, there a mix, everywhere a mix mix. - What are you talking about, Mr. Slaney? - Oh, I don't know, just poke around in there. You'll find out that I've said something. Ah, let's see. I figure I'll make the bottom shelf about a foot and a half wide. That will take care of your tall books and your record albums. [sobbing] Then, Mrs. Curtis, I can put your stereo right about here. Mrs. Curtis? Mrs. Curtis, you OK? Oh, come on. Mrs. Curtis, you got your whole life ahead of you. Got a beautiful apartment, and you have lovely things. You have good looks. I'm building new shelves for you. That's better. That's better. - I really didn't mean to cry. - It's OK. - I just had to let it out or I would have gotten herpes. - Well, you're feeling better now, Mrs. Curtis? - Yeah, all better, Mr. Slaney. - You sure? - I'm really fine. Don't worry. Now, let's both of us get back to work, huh? - OK. Hi. - Oh, hi. - Any more of that coffee left? - Oh, it's cold now. - Oh, no. It couldn't have cooled off that fast. Mrs. Curtis, I don't think I told you how great that outfit looks on you. - Oh, yeah. Yes, you told me. I distinctly remember hearing it. You said, Mrs. Curtis, you look snazzy. I heard you say that. - It shows your figure off, to a great advantage. - Yeah, well, it's just the outfit, Mr. Slaney. Believe me, it's just an old piece of chiffon. - Mrs. Curtis, I think I'm going to kiss you. - Oh, no. No, no. Just sit still. It'll pass. Have some cold coffee. - No, I don't want any. - Or better yet, I'll make you some eggs. - No, don't bother. - Oh. Do you want then scrambled? How about poached? Well, one scrambled and one poached. - No eggs. No eggs. - You know, Mrs. Slaney, maybe 18 inches is too high for this shelf. It's really-- I can't reach it. And besides, I only have one, big book, and it's boring. And it's a picture book about sea shells. And what the hell, if you've seen one seashell, you've seen them all. Well now, don't get me wrong. I have nothing against seashells. I actually, I loved the beach. My husband just hated the beach, but every time the kids came in from the beach, they used to track the sand through the house, and I used to say, wash your feet. Wash your feet. If I said it 100 times, I said it-- Mrs. Slaney, what kind of a woman do you think I am? How dare you? Taking advantage of a separated person? Don't you ever do that again. You did it again. - I know. I know. And I'm going to do it again. - I'm afraid, Mr. Slaney. - So am I, Mrs. Curtis. - Almost a year has passed since that first night alone. In that time, Catherine has made some mistakes, laughed, cried, found a job, and fallen in love. His name is Peter, and he is 14 years younger than she is. - Let me take this. I'll hang them in the bathroom to dry. - It was the worst single play I've ever seen in my life, but I loved it. Because an English actor can read graffiti off a wall and make it sound like Shakespeare. - I agree. - For a rollicking good time, call Kinky Kitty, Stratford 2 7700. - Do you know if they can channel your brain for peaceful purposes, they can send a cuckoo to the moon? - I need cognac. - We'll get you some cognac. - Hey, I got a terrific idea. - What? - Let's stay dressed just like this for a month. - What? - I'm serious. We'll sip champagne on the subway. Sing "Begin the Beguine" in the automat. And tap dance our way into the hearts of millions. (SINGING) If you're blue and you don't where to go to, why don't you where fashion sits? Puttin' on the Ritz. Bap, bap, badap, badap bap bap. - Peter, you are certifiably crazy. - You're absolutely right. It's a totally ridiculous idea. That's fly to London. - Drink your brandy. - I'm serious. - I know you are. - We'll stay at the Connor on Grosvenor Square. We'll lunch every day at the White Elephant, the theater every night, late supper, a tram. (SINGING) Some foggy day in London town. London is my favorite city in the whole world. Let me share it with you. - Are you hungry? I'll making eggs. - How come you don't ever want to go away with me? - Come on. Let's play, huh? [giggling] - What's funny? - That little old lady sitting next to you in the theater. Oh, it was just hysterical. That look on your face when she fell asleep on your shoulder. The curtain went up, her head fell down. You know, when she finally woke up, she was so embarrassed. And you just winked at her and said, I'll miss you. You know, you're charming. - Hey, go easy on me. I'm not geared for too much acceptance. - No, really. Do you have any idea how really charming you are? - Well, I guess I just have a way with little old ladies. - I know. - You're um, not going to go into old-age routine again, are you? - Come on. Let's play. Forget it. - OK, you want to be old? I'm going to let you be old. Forget about London. We're going to Sun City. Hey, you'll love it this time of year. They've got a raisin festival. And I'll tell you what. I'll get you a Gucci surgical corset. How's that? And if you play your cards right, I might even get you a sequined cane. OK? Huh? Huh, honey? - You won't like it there. They don't get Sesame Street. - OK. I want to tell you one more time. You're not old, you're not young. You're Catherine. And that's a lot. - See how great you are with little old ladies? - Shut up and play. - OK, roll it out. Here we go. - Here we go. - You've got a B. - Cinque and cinque. - Oh, mercy me. - Am I going to whip you. - Not with that. Peter, you know you have nice knuckles? - All 10? - Well, eight aren't bad. Two could use a little work. - You think we were destined to meet? - I don't know. - If I came to that party 15 minutes later, you would have been gone. You were standing by the door with your coat on looking very bored. - M-hm. I would have gone if you hadn't said what you said. - Oh, yeah? What did I say? - You said, if you walk out that door, I'll drown myself in the guacamole dip. - Did I say that? - Yeah. You always were a smooth talker. - That's my curse. - Ah, tell me some of your other opening lines with women, Mr. Velvet Lips. - There were no other women before you. - Good heavens. Does the Guinness Book of Records know about you, a 40-year-old virgin? - I was always an underachiever. - No, really. Come on, tell me. I want to hear some of your other world-famous ice breakers. - All right. There was this sexy little dental hygienist about six months ago. I was sitting in a chair. She was cleaning my teeth. I looked up at her and I said, what's a nice girl like you doing in a mouth like this? [laughing] - What did she say? - Spit out. - And that was the end of the relationship? - That was one of the longer ones. - If you want to know the truth, I really don't find it too easy striking up conversations with people I don't know. - You didn't seem to have any trouble with me. - You were different. Besides, it was no fear of rejection. You were leaving the party anyway. - Well now, could any woman in her right mind reject you? A gorgeous man in a tuxedo with clean teeth. You are irresistible. - Irresistible? - Irresistible. - Marry me. - Look, you must be starved. Let me make you an omelet. Huh? - Hey. How come every time the conversation gets heavy, you want to feed me? - Isn't that what a mother is supposed to do? You are looking for your mother, you know. - You know how old my first wife was when I married her? Same age as me. Now, what was I looking for then, my sister? My marriage was a total disaster, not a little one, a total one. Six years of climbing into bed every night with a smoked salmon. - A smoked salmon? I wonder how you describe me. - You're a tiger shark. - Peter. - Keep quiet. I'm looking for my mother. - Peter. - If this doesn't work out, next year I'm going to look for my brother. - Peter, now listen, why me? You're attractive. Successful. You can have any young chick in the whole world. Why me? - Well, I'll tell you the truth. In the last 10 years since my divorce, you're the first woman I've gone out with who knows who John Garfield is. - Oh, for god's sake. - Hey, I'm serious. You know what it's like to go out with a girl who thinks that Joe DiMaggio was a veal dish? And if I have ever hear the words far out or out of sight again, and what's that other beauty? Hey, man. Oh, wow. What the hell is that, oh, wow? It sounds like Mandarin cooking. - You still haven't answered my question. Why me? - Because I love you. I love everything about you. Now look here, Scarlett, dry those tears, baby. - Oh, stop it. - Stop what? - Stop wallowing in the past. Garfield, Gable, DiMaggio. Catherine Curtis. You're a nostalgia freak. That's what you are. Well, I just don't want to be added to your collection of antiques. - You know what you are? You're a future freak. Whenever I ask you to marry me, you say, oh, it's fine for now, but what about 10 years from now? Forget about 10 years from now. - I'm just being practical. - You're not being practical. You're scared. - Now, I tell you what I'm going to do for you. I'm going to make you a nice deal. You forget all about the future and I'll forget all about the past. Fair enough? - You got a deal. - A deal? - Deal. - Marry me. - OK. - What? [laughing] i - Scared the hell out of you, didn't I? - No, you didn't scare me. - Oh, not much. - You surprised me. - I know. I know I did. - There's a difference. I've been asking you to marry me all this time. You've been saying no. Now, all of a sudden, you say yes. It would have surprised anybody. I mean, that's ridiculous. - Peter, why can't we just leave this relationship alone? We're in each other's lives. We make each other feel so good. Why don't we just leave it at that? - I don't want it to end. - Oh, well now, let's face it. We both know that marriage doesn't guarantee anything. - You know something? - Hm? - I am hungry. - Well, good. I'll make you my specialty, omelet alsace-- bacon, green peppers, onions, and tomatoes. - Nah. - To an omelet alsace, you say nah? - I say double nah. - What I'm in the mood is seafood. - Seafood. Well, I'm afraid I don't have a very big choice. It's between tuna fish and a can of Puss in Boots. - I had Puss in Boots for lunch. What I want is some cracked crab, a loaf of sour dough bread smothered with butter, and some little baby sand dabs, gently sauteed with hash brown potatoes. Let's go. - Go where? - San Francisco. - It's raining. - I'll get an umbrella. - Peter. - I'm offering you Fisherman's Wharf, a table for two by the water of (SINGING) San Francisco. Open your Golden Gate. Come on. We'll catch the red eye flight. - Why can't you just like something without having to fly to it? - Because they don't deliver. - London. San Francisco. Your fantasies of giving me jet lag. - Hey, you want to know what a fantasy is? It's a reality you're too chicken to live out. That's right. - Look, let's just stay here and have some eggs. - Eggs. With Catherine Curtis, solution to everything, let's have eggs. General, the Apaches are attacking. The fort is in flames. What do we do? Stupid, make eggs. - OK. OK. You made your point. - Why do you keep fighting me? - Why do you always overwhelm me? San Francisco. London. Marriage. Just once I'd like you to suggest something that doesn't require a passport or a Wassermann test. - All right. So maybe I do get carried away a little. Sue me. - Look, Peter, I'm not criticizing. I love your spontaneity. It's just that I'm past the point in my life where I can just pick up and do things on a whim. - Were you ever able to? - Maybe not. I'm not as impetuous as you are. I'm not as free as you are. I'm not as young as you are. - Again. - Yes, again. The years between us do make a big difference. - This is really starting to get to me. I love you, and you love me. Now, that should be enough. Why can't you just accept that instead of being ashamed of me? That's right. You're ashamed of me. Don't think I don't notice when we walk down the street, your eyes darting all over the place to see what people are thinking. Even at the theater tonight. You kept inching away from me because God forbid, somebody might think we're together. Oh, yeah. And when your daughters were in town, you think I bought that dumb story that in four whole days, they couldn't fine one minute to meet me? How's that supposed to make me feel? Don't do it anymore cause I don't like it. So stop being ashamed. - Peter, I am not ashamed of you. I'm ashamed of me. Do you think I haven't thought about making a commitment to you? But I know me. And I know what I can handle. And the first time I see some young girl around you, I'd get jealous, and you wouldn't like that. Peter, if there's one thing I've learned in the last year it's that I can be hurt just as much now as I could when I was 18. I fall in love just as hard. And it's just as painful to break up. - Is that what we're doing? - I'll get your coat. It's almost dry. [crying] We're flying to San Francisco, right? - Right. - I don't even get to pack? - Right again. - Oh, Peter, let me get my tooth brush. - We'll buy one at the airport. - You know, I'm not crazy about flying. - I've heard that. - And I'm not too crazy about seafood either. - No kidding. - I can't believe I'm going to San Francisco. - You want to hear a coincidence? - What? - Everybody on the plane is going there. - But they have luggage. - Shut up and drink your eggs. [music playing] - Peter? - What? - I just remembered I have a duck defrosting in the kitchen. - We'll send him a postcard. [music playing]
