Okay, mustard. I'm pickle, maddie's mustard, you're hot dog. You keep mustard and pickle together. [gentle music] [birds chirping] Did you find the ball yet? [young mad die] it's somewhere here in these bushes. [gentle music] [birds chirping] [young Olivia] I don't see it. [young mad die] well, it's gotta be here somewhere. Keep looking. [dramatic music] [birds chirping] I don't know, I guess it was a bad throw. I think you're just bad at catching. [both gasping] Where's Abby? I don't know, she was just there. Abigail?! [dramatic music] Abby, no. - Wait! - Stop! - Abby, get back here, stop! - Abby! [young mad die] Abby, come back! Abby, no, Abby! [dramatic music] Abby, Abby no. Abby, Abby no. [gasping] [gentle music] [car engines outside] [gentle music] [cellphone ringing] Morning sis, rough night? No, I'm just, I'm on deadline for these new drawings. And I just have this block. I'm sorry, livy, But I'm still seeing you for lunch today, right? [livy] lunch? Yeah, sorry, at the cemetery, of course. You know, sometimes I feel like. You make an effort to forget. No, I just like to celebrate her birth, not her death. Please don't make me go alone. Maddie, I would never let you go alone. Thank you. Oh, do you have time to pick a flowers? I've got a pitch with the editor in 20 minutes. Sure. Love you. Love you. [phone clicks] [gentle music] [sighs] [bus engine revving] [gentle music] [clock ticking] [gentle music] [birds chirping] [dramatic music] [shower running] Three women, three different communities, Three different disappearances. They all were independent, they lived alone. No history of domestic violence or being stalked. So what's the connection? If you just take a look at their hair color, Their eyes, their facial structure even. I mean, these women could practically be related. I think we have a serial killer on our hands. Without bodies, that's a big leap, To say that this is the work of one man. I know. That's why I wanna look into it some more. I need to interview every person these women knew. And I need this paper's resources to do it. This is good, mad die. But you were hired to head up local news, Do the weekly community corner column. Right. Well, community of course, is why this is important. If you look at the slide five... - The map on slide five. - Mm hmm. All of the communities where these women disappeared from. Make a direct line towards ours. We are right in this killer's path. It's been one year since the last disappearance, And I think he's already here. And looking for his next victim. That's a working theory. You're a good journalist, mad die. But right now the answer's no. I need you to bring me something more than hair color. But what if I, uh...? There's a new park opening on Friday. Sink your investigative teeth into that. Sure. Thank you for your time. I'll get right on it. [shower running] [eerie music] [Olivia screaming] No, no, no. [Olivia] no please! No! [dramatic music] [Olivia] go away, get out of here. [man grunting and pounding on door] I have my phone, I'm calling the police. Get out. [door banging] [operator] 911, what's your emergency? Operator, there's someone in my house, There's someone in my house. [door banging] Please send someone now. [dramatic music] [operator] just stay where you are, Don't unlock the door. We're dispatching you next to your address. [people speaking indistinctly] [telephone ringing] [people speaking indistinctly] So, how'd it go? [sighing] Damn, I'm sorry. I thought for sure she would go for it. And it's such an important story, I really wanna stop this guy. Me too. Well, I got a park opening instead, so. [telephone ringing] [cellphone beeping] Oh my god. [dramatic music] [knocking on door] Olivia, it's mad die. Answer me. Hey. Olivia. Easy on my door. My sister's in there and she's in trouble, excuse me. [Todd] what's going on? [window knocking] Pickle, are you there? Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. Oh, thank god she's all right. I came as soon as I saw the bluebird, what happened? [Olivia] someone broke in. When I was getting in the shower. Got a call, someone with screaming, I guess that was you. 45 minutes ago. I was out at my other properties. Did you call the cops? Yeah, they said they were sending someone. They could take hours. How did they get in? Through the window. Yeah, we've had a few of those. You just gotta make sure everything's locked up. Extra tight around here. Maybe you could have bars on the windows, I don't know. She just could have gotten killed. Bars, you want extra security. When I'm not even getting my rent? [Olivia] I told you, I... You're behind? I don't get paid again until I turn in my drawings. I'll help her. No, you don't have to do that. Yeah, she kind of does. Or you'll be out on your ass, sweetie. Excuse me, don't call her sweetie okay, Especially if you want something from me. I know that you guys have been through a lot. In your lives. She didn't say anything, I just do a deep dive on all my tenants. But I do need my rent asap. Yeah, I know. We'll get it to you, okay. Bye. [dramatic music] That guy is such a creep. I really don't know why you stay here and put up with that. Mom always said, "catch more flies with honey." Yeah, well, you catch a-hole flies too. You think it was Todd that broke in here? Maddie, he is a key, why would he go through the window? I don't know. But I think maybe you should move in with me. Until he gets some bars on these windows. No, thank you. But I need space for work. My place has plenty of space. And maybe a change of scenery will help unblock you. I could use the company. Do me a favor, come on. [gentle music] Do you promise not to mother me? No. Fine, yeah. Thank you. [gentle music] [insects chirping] I'm really glad we went today to the cemetery. Didn't realize how lucky I am. So, you know that article I pitched my editor? Yeah, about the disappearances? Yeah. Well, I didn't wanna tell you this. Because I didn't want you to worry, But I think that whoever's responsible. Might be here in Atlanta. Look, you fit the profile, right, Late 20s, blonde, single. No, no, I'm not gonna let you do this. Do what? I'm not gonna live my life. Thinking every person I meet is a monster. Livy, you have to understand, I can't lose you too. You are not going to lose me. Have you ever thought about taking a self-defense class? I already know to stick my fingers in someone's eyes. And then throw a knee in their crotch. There's a lot more than that. Please, for me. Can we just take a couple of classes? I promise it'll be painless. Of course. Thank you. [gentle music] [haden] welcome to women's self-defense intensive. My name is haden, and I'll be your self defense instructor. Now, in this class, you're gonna learn verbal strategies, Situational awareness, assault prevention. And physical assailant defense. I'm gonna arm you with the tools to fight back, okay. All right, what is your name? Right here in front. Olivia. Olivia, great, can you come on up and help me please? Go on. [haden] come on, I'm not gonna hurt you. Okay. All right, Olivia, Have you ever taken a self defense class before? - Nope. - Okay. Well, why did you sign up for my class? My sister, mad die, wanted me to. I had a break in. Oh, okay. Well go on. Look, we need to be more open about these experiences, okay. Because you could also help somebody here in this classroom. By sharing with us. Well, I had someone break into my house, And I managed to lock myself in the bathroom, So he actually didn't touch me. Well, that's good. But what if you did get in, What would you have been able to do? Rule number one, when there is a threat, You do not hesitate, you act. You strike, you strike first and you strike hard. You do not let them take the advantage. And then you do whatever it is that you have to do. To get away. You pull hair, you gouge eyes. And as much as it pains me to say this, You kick him in the crotch, okay. [all laughing] All right, well, we're actually gonna. Do a little demonstration here, And Olivia is going to actually knee me in the groin, okay. All right, don't worry, I have some pads. And I'm a professional, so, I've done this before. It's okay. Now, I can't put my arm around you, So you put yours around me. Just go ahead, put 'em around me. There you go. And I'm gonna just hold my hands down here. - Okay. - All right. Look at me. When you're ready, just knee him in the crotch, okay. On you, ready? Go. Again. That's it, go. All right, one more. Nice, all right. [all applauding] Great job. Let's give Olivia a hand. Okay, you can have a seat. Okay. We'll have a next volunteer. Yeah, thank you. [gentle music] Okay, like we just did. [gentle music] [mad die] geez, you're really getting into this. I know. I've got some new ideas for the book too. Well, look at that. You've been inspired. Just like I said. I don't know, I think it's just the adrenaline. You gotta gimme some pointers now. [Olivia] maybe. You like him? [Olivia] who? Haden, from self defense. He is very attractive, mad die. He's our instructor, Olivia. Yeah, but even if he wasn't and I met him out in the wild, You'd still find something wrong with him, right? Well, just want you to be careful, that's all. Yeah. I know. [dramatic music] [insects chirping] [dramatic music] [cellphone beeping] [dramatic music] [car engines revving] [knocking on door] [kyle] yeah, come in. Hey, kyle. Hey, mad die. I'm not bothering you, am I? No, you just, come on in. Mi casa is your casa too. There you go. Sorry about the... Everything. What's up? So, I know Rachel didn't approve the article, But I'm not giving up. Good for you. What do you need from me? Really? I mean, I know without her green lighting something, It could kinda put you in an awkward position. Well, the fact is, this story could save a life. Besides, I get a lunch hour. Awesome, okay. So, I need some background on two names. The first one is Todd young, he is a local property manager. From the lake wood area. I need a list of all of his properties. To see if they connect to the towns. Where those women went missing. Exactly. And the second is, haden Carmichael. He's a self defense instructor, But that's kinda all I know about him. Okay. That's gonna cast a pretty wide net. I'm gonna need more info to really narrow down that search. Yeah, sorry. I mean, you know, I did a basic search on him, And I really came up with close to nothing. In this day and age, mad die, If someone doesn't have any kind of digital footprint, There's a reason for it. Usually it's something they're trying to hide. Yeah, it's what I'm afraid of. [dramatic music] Hey there, teach. Hey. Oh, mad die, you're alone. Did I scare your sister off already? No, she's meeting us here later. I came straight from work. Okay, good. You need a hand? Yeah, you can grab those gloves over there. Sure. So how'd you get involved in all this self defense stuff? Well, friend of mine was attacked, So I decided never again. How noble. Yeah. So where are you from? The mid west. Upper mid west like Michigan, or lower like Oklahoma. What are you, a cop? No, reporter. Sorry, all the inquisitiveness. Kinda comes with the position. And don't worry, haden, she's no woodward or Bernstein, She just writes local puff pieces to make people smile. Right, mad die? Right. [laughing] You know, we should do an article on you and the class. Get the word out, increase those numbers. Ah you know, I appreciate the offer, But I'm really a very private person, so, no thank you. Well, if the goal is to protect as many women as possible. Maddie, I think he said no, let's quit being pushy. No, it's okay. Your sister's just doing what reporters do. Oh, I need to start the class. [dramatic music] Chill. [both laughing] In most attack scenarios, You're gonna be facing an assailant. Who is bigger than you and stronger than you. But don't worry, there's some very simple techniques. That require no strength at all. Maddie, can you come help me today? [mad die] sure. Okay, in this scenario, you're gonna be the aggressor. So you're just gonna reach out, you're gonna grab my wrist. Go ahead. All right, see that? Once they're down here, you're in control. Even the biggest, strongest man will be begging for mercy. All right, listen, When we're out there working on our techniques, I need you guys to understand the pain. That is caused with this movement. Right, you need to learn to accept it. You need to embrace it. All right, let's get up, pair up and warm up. Here, let me help you up. Gosh, I am so sorry. I guess I don't know my own strength. Let me see that. Yeah, you're gonna be okay though. If I wanted to hurt you, would've been easy. [dramatic music] All right, gather around. [dramatic music] So just make sure you're right there. You gotta maintain that position. So you don't hurt your wrist, okay. - Yeah, yeah. - Yeah. [Olivia] cool. Well, there she is. Have you forgiven me yet? Oh, yeah. Just like you said, the bumps and bruises. Are just part for the course, right? Ready? Oh, haden and I, were actually gonna go grab a bite. But we had plans. Dinner and a movie at your house are not plans. You can do that anytime. Do you wanna come? Yeah, come on. You should come along, mad die. [car engines revving] Who's that? [dramatic music] You know what? I appreciate the offer, But I have to go work on this article. Oh, article. Well, suit yourself. Should we go? Yeah, I'm good. Love you. Love you. [car engines revving] [dramatic music] [truck engine revving] [dramatic music] [insects chirping] [cellphone beeping] [dramatic music] [insects chirping] [dramatic music] [car horns honking] [car engines revving] [upbeat music] [jack] mad die. Jack? Yeah. You look just like a picture. So do you. [upbeat music] Better even. ♪ You can't tell me how to live my life ♪ You ready for another? [upbeat music] ♪ I may be young but I made up my mind ♪ [upbeat music] [people speaking indistinctly] ♪ I got this feeling bottled inside of me ♪ ♪ I see you looking, do you like what you see ♪ ♪ do want that, do you need that ♪ ♪ well this is your chance ♪ ♪ I'll let you touch me and undress me ♪ ♪ we can do anything ♪ [upbeat music] ♪ Oh ♪ [upbeat music] [gasping] [mad die screaming] Maddie, it's okay, it's okay. It's just me, it's okay. What the hell is going on? Oh, haden is just cleaning up. Why is he covered in blood? Well, it's not our blood. If that's what has you're so spooked. No. After class we went to the store. And got some food and wine for a picnic. Yeah, there's this magical spot I wanted to take her to, But, you know, it's a little off the beaten path. Yeah and we just laid in the grass. And looked at the stars. We just talked, or I just talked really. I loved hearing about your life, it's incredible. What is the blood from? Well, I mean, when we realized how late it was, I rushed in order to get her back home to you. And that's why we had a deer. Actually, it's a buck. It's a buck. Yeah, yeah. Then I didn't want it to go to waste, So I hauled it into my truck and, you know, here you go. Instead of leaving it in the grass, like nature intended. Well, I mean, I thrive on living off the land, so. Haden likes to commune with nature. Yeah, I mean, nature gave me this gift, And so it's my responsibility. [laughing] Isn't that amazing? - Well. - Yeah. It's late. But thank you for letting me clean up. Yeah, of course. I had incredible time with you tonight. And thank you, mad die, For letting me spend time with your amazing sister. You're welcome. [dramatic music] Goodnight. [Olivia] night. You went hiking in the middle of the night. With a man you hardly know. I know. It was so exhilarating. What did I tell you, Olivia? No hikes, no cruises. It's not like I disappeared. He watched over me the entire time. And he didn't even try to kiss me. He was the perfect gentleman. Yeah, I bet. [cellphone beeping] And how was your date? I didn't have a date. [cellphone beeping] Oh, really? Who's jack? [gentle music] Stop trying to change the subject, okay. Are you gonna see him again? If he asks, definitely. Well, did you find out anything about him, Where he came from, does he have family, friends? Because I'd like to know. Well, what did you find out about jack? Does he have friends, family? I'd like to know. [dramatic music] Goodnight. [dramatic music] [mad die] I need to know. What you found out about the truck. [kyle] not much. I sent in a request for any violations against it, But there's only so much I can do with just a truck. What else do you need? Passport, driver's license, credit card, Anything with his full name on it? Sure, I think I can do that. Oh, do you want to know. What I found out about your sister's landlord, Todd young? Of course. Well, besides lake wood, he has properties all over, Including perryman. Ho warden? Not that's in the public record. Well, two outta three ain't bad, But that's nothing definitive. [dramatic music] What is it? Well, both these men are in my sister's life, And I don't know how to protect her, Other than locking her away. And she probably wouldn't like that very much, so. We're gonna figure this out, no matter what it takes. Yeah. You're the best, kyle, thank you, really. [dramatic music] Yeah, Jeff, you're killing it. Again, good. Five more. Good, good, good form. Nice and slow on the way down. Good. Again. Nice. Pull through your lats here. Nice work, nice work. Keep going, keep going. Nice. [dramatic music] Extend it all the way out, back, good. Nice work, Jeff. Go, go. Add more, come on, come on. [dramatic music] [telephone ringing] All right, listen. You switch over to the left side, okay. I'm gonna go answer that. [telephone ringing] Yeah, I'll be right back. [telephone ringing] Maddie. Oh, hey. What are you doing in here? I just slipped in. I didn't wanna interrupt you. Yeah, well, you kinda did. Oh, well, I thought I left a sweatshirt here. After last time and thought, maybe it was in lost and found. Yeah, well, that's not the lost and found. And nothing was left after the last class. Oh shoot. It was my favorite. I always do that. Yeah. Well, I'm sorry again for the interruption, And I will see you later. [dramatic music] And so then she pops out from the back seat. Where she'd been hiding. What? And says, "this isn't the movies." No, we can laugh about it now, but I loved that boy. Oh god. I just, I don't even know. There's so much that I wanna say right now, But I just can't. No, what is it? No, no, no, I am not gonna add some family drama. Between you and your sister. No, I am giving you a pass. That's why I told you that story, I know she can be difficult. Okay. You're not gonna like it. I ran into your sister today. Yeah, at the studio, in the back. [Olivia] what? Like rummaging through my stuff. And she gave me some like ridiculous story. That she like lost a hoodie or something. And at the time I thought, oh okay, But now that you tell me this, I realized, no, no, She does this to everybody. I'm sorry, that she's checking on you like that. There's no excuse, but she... What? There's a history. A history? Can't believe I'm telling you this right now. Maddie and I used to have a sister, Abigail. Had a sister? When we were younger, Our mom used to leave us with her a lot to watch her. We'd, you know, go to the playground. Maddie wandered away for a second and I wasn't looking. And then, you know, she was just gone. [gentle music] What do you mean "gone"? Someone took her. But we go to her grave every year. And mad die and I just went, So I'm sure she's just a little extra protective right now. [gentle music] I'm so sorry. I know that that's a lot. That's why I usually save that for the third date. I don't know what to say, just... It's okay if you wanna take me home now. Take you home? You just shared an incredibly personal story. I mean, I don't want to take you home, I want to hear more of your stories. It helps me understand who you are. And what you've been through, you and your sister. And it's a lot. Thank you. And now I understand. I understand why she's doing what she's doing right now. What do you mean? [dramatic music] No, no, no, no, no, don't. Don't, don't. She's spying on us. No, no. She was spying on us, but we're alone now, so. That's what you think. No, just let her go okay. Let her go away from here. And then you and I will go somewhere else. We'll go somewhere that she can't find us, okay. And we'll stay up all night. And you can tell me all of your stories. And we go hide somewhere away from the dangers. Of this crazy world. [Olivia] that sounds nice. [dramatic music] [haden] I'll take care of you. [dramatic music] [cellphone beeping] [birds chirping] [gentle music] [birds chirping] [Olivia] you're up. Yeah, of course I'm up. I've been waiting for you all night. You know I was with haden. I know he's hiding something. Kyle from work agrees with me. It's really weird. That there's nothing about him online, Olivia. And I know there is a killer on the loose. You sound totally paranoid right now. Hey, I just asked you for a couple of days. I wanted to check up on a few things. You mean break into his studio. And spy on us while we're having dinner? I didn't break in. And I went to that restaurant to make sure you were safe. He makes me feel safe, mad die. I don't trust him. Okay. It's time for me to move home. What? Todd called, they caught the guy that broke in. And they're going to put bars on my windows. Yeah, right. I don't trust that guy either. That's your problem, mad die. You don't trust anybody. Do you ever ask yourself why that is? I have my reasons. You blame me for Abigail. You blame me for everything, you always have. I asked you to watch her. If you thought it was dangerous, Then why did you leave us? We were just kids. Did you once say maybe watch out for that car. Or that you had a bad feeling? No. I've always tried to protect you, both of you. That's my job. I love you, mad die. But you are not going to bring back Abigail. By trying to stop me from living my life. Right. Well, if that's how you feel, then I guess you should go. Okay, packing now. Fine! [insects chirping] [dramatic music] [cellphone beeping] [upbeat music] What are these for? What are you doing with these? Maybe I'm planning on stealing you away. It's not funny. It's just a joke. Oh, come on. Oh, so that's it, you're just gonna leave. Afraid so. Again. [dramatic music] [insects chirping] [dramatic music] [insects chirping] [dramatic music] [insects chirping] [dramatic music] [insects chirping] [dramatic music] [car engine revving] [car horn honking] [dramatic music] [insects chirping] [dramatic music] [coughing] [dramatic music] [mad die] hello? Hello? Hello? [mad die] hello, is anyone there, hello? [dramatic music] Hello? [knocking on door] [dramatic music] [knocking on door] Can anyone hear me? I'm trapped in the garage. [knocking on door] Somebody help me. [dramatic music] [knocking on door] Help me! I'm trapped in the garage! Hello? [mad die] somebody! Anybody. [knocking on door] I'm in the garage, hello. I'm trapped in the garage, help. Can somebody help me. [dramatic music] [coughing] [dramatic music] Can anyone hear me, hello? [dramatic music] Hello? [dramatic music] [insects chirping] [Henry] mad die! [dramatic music] Maddie. [dramatic music] Maddie, you okay? [dramatic music] Maddie. Hold on, mad die, I got you. There you go. [dramatic music] [people speaking indistinctly] Someone tried to kill me. Someone stole my keys and locked me in the garage. With the car on. Luckily my neighbor, Henry, He heard me and he dragged me out. We checked, There's no evidence anyone broke into your house. And Henry said the door came right open. I told you they were all damn shut. Any idea who would do such a thing? I was out earlier this evening. And maybe someone followed me home. Out where? Park sports bar. [policewoman] well were you drinking? I wasn't drunk. You left your purse in the car. No, I didn't. I don't know how it got there. I told you someone put it there. And locked you in the garage? Yes. Has there been any unusual stress. Or trauma in your life lately? What does that have to do with anything? I'm just wondering if you've been experiencing. Any depression or dark thoughts. You think, I tried to kill myself. [people speaking indistinctly] I'm trying to tell you, someone tried to kill me. You're the police, do something. Maddie, are you okay? I suggest you come to the station in the morning. And tell your story to a detective, If that's what you wanna do. [mad die] thank you. You okay? [mad die] what's he doing here? He drove me. I was too upset to drive. Where's he been all night? What? He was next to me, he was in bed with me. When I got the call. No. What? Come on, I'm just so happy you're okay. [dramatic music] How are you feeling? Just a little headache. That's good. That is, just a little one. So when do you wanna go down to the police station? I don't know. You don't know? [mad die] no. You said someone tried to kill you last night. They did, but the cops don't believe me, so. So make them. I shouldn't have to convince you to do this. Unless. Olivia, I didn't try to hurt myself. I know how this looks, okay. And I wanna apologize to you for all of the accusations. And the crazy behavior. [car engines revving] Maybe it's time you put this article to rest. [birds chirping] Hey, I have an idea. How about, to say sorry, I make you do dinner tonight? You don't have to do that. I want to. Okay, yeah, no, I'd really like that. Okay. I'll make your favorite. This'll be good. Good. [dramatic music] [insects chirping] Ah, this has been truly amazing, mad die, thank you. Well, I would do anything for Olivia. I just wanna see her happy. Yeah, I know that feeling. And this has made me really happy, mad die, thank you. So have you two thought about the future? Actually, yeah. [both laughing] Well? A little house in the country, Somewhere we can see the stars every night. Live off the land, you know, commune with nature. Were you raised in the country? Yeah. Yeah, I was. And where was that? Maddie. Sorry, promised I wouldn't play a reporter tonight. Just wanna get to know the man my sister loves. No, look, it's fine, she's right. I'll warn you though, I'm not really comfortable. Talking about myself, so. Well, that's fair enough. [haden] yeah. How about we finish off this wine? [Olivia] okay. Thank you. Here you go. You two look so cute. Get together for a picture for you. Yeah. All right, best smiles, only please. [camera shutter clicking] Aw, cute, cute, cute. It's a keeper. She sure is. [dramatic music] Cheers to love. To love. Cheers. [dramatic music] You don't have to do that. Dinner was so delicious. The least I can do is help you with the dishes. You're beautiful. See, it's not so bad, right? No, I guess not. Thank you. [dramatic music] Oh. What's that? Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry, I didn't see it there. Did you do that on purpose? [dramatic music] What? I can pay for repairs or get you a new one? I mean... No, why would you do that on purpose? [dramatic music] Haden, would you mind waiting in the truck? I think I need to talk to my sister for a minute. Yeah. Thank you for a lovely evening. [dramatic music] I'll be outside. [dramatic music] Olivia, there are still. Please let me talk. I love haden, mad die. You just met him. I know that. I understand that. And that's why we're not rushing off to get married. But do you realize you've done this. With every man I've ever been interested in? And I appreciate it, I understand why you do it. But I really care about him, mad die. You have to let me figure this out for myself. Without interfering. Can you do that? [gentle music] I just need you to trust me to make this decision on my own. Okay. Thank you. But you know, there is something. That I just still don't know about him, It's just driving me crazy. [dramatic music] You're unbelievable. Olivia, wait. [Olivia] no. Olivia, Olivia wait. We still don't know where he's from. And even kyle can't find a trace of him online. And he could have snuck over here last night. And stolen my key from my purse. Olivia. [truck engines revving] Olivia, wait. [dramatic music] [truck engine revving] Olivia. [dramatic music] Look, I wanna get this guy too, But there's nothing I can do to save this. What? But I need those photos for the facial recognition software. Shh, shh, quiet. What can we do? Okay, when you back up your files, Do you do it automatically or is it scheduled? I don't know.

We were connecting the disappearances of three women. To a single perpetrator. It's all on the computers. His hard drive was wiped clean. What? Our it specialists are gonna try and recover it. Well, it's obvious that the killer did all this. They wiped the drives clean. And they mess with the security cameras. Before we go any further, Would you like to have lawyer present? Why? I didn't kill him. [dramatic music] Whoever did this was the same person. That tried to kill me two nights ago. Someone tried to kill you, two nights ago? And there's record of this?

Why not? I just thought I could handle it myself. So let me get this straight, Someone tried to kill you. And you didn't follow up with the department? I followed up with kyle. We were honing in on a few subjects, we were close. Whoever did this was the same person. Who murdered those women. It's the same person who tried to kill me. Do you have any names?

A man is dead because you wouldn't listen to me. I can't do this with you anymore. I'm sorry. Are you firing me? You turned our offices into a crime scene. You and kyle were sneaking around operating behind my back. Even if this hadn't happened, your work as a reporter. Has been completely unreliable. So, yes, I'm firing you. I'm sorry, Rachel.

Of being a killer? [car engine revving] Listen, you have to understand, I love my sister to death, But she gets a little crazy overprotective. And for whatever reason, she just has it in her head.

Visiting family. And haden, your sister says he was with her all night. She's lying. Kyle told me that he found something. Well, we can't prove that. What we can prove is the murder weapon.
