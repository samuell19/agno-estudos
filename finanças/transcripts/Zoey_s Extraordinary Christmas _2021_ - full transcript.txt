Hi, my name is Zoey Clarke, and my story is probably going to be the most unusual one you hear today. [UPBEAT MUSIC] About a year and a half ago, I was just a regular programmer gal, hiding behind my computer at a big tech company here in San Francisco. But then, I started having some really bad headaches. So I went to get an MRI, and as I was lying in the machine, there was an earthquake. And it was like all the songs in the world suddenly got uploaded into my brain. Next thing I know, I can hear people's innermost thoughts expressed through musical numbers. This power taught me that, however it looks on the outside, we're all messed up. We all have our own issues. My main issue, BTW, was that my father was dying of a rare neurological disease while this was all happening. He couldn't speak, walk, move, trapped in his own body. But because of my new ability, we could suddenly communicate all over again through song, which was everything. When my dad died, my family was lost. But we learned over the last eight months to carry on. Whatever that means. But now there's a whole new problem. About two weeks ago, out of nowhere my boyfriend, Max, also got my musical powers and... Whoa, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I'm gonna have to stop you right there. Is there something wrong? This is a very extraordinary tale, but I have lots of children waiting. - Okay. - And all I asked you was, "What's your name, what do you want for Christmas?" Oh. I just thought you needed the back story to really understand my wish. I guess I just want my dad back for Christmas or some clarity on why this happened to me and my boyfriend. I mean, I know that my dad said that the universe has some grand plan for me but... I'll do my best to help but this might be slightly above my pay grade. Smile. - Merry Christmas. - [LAUGHS] - Okay, thank you. - Yeah. Is it... is it really necessary? Okay, okay, I'm going. I'm going. Don't look at me like that. The picture was for my mother. I have a dead father. ♪ ♪ Isn't this great? The smell of peppermint lattes filling the air, major discount sales happening everywhere, and both Black and white people alike all equally stressed out. How could you not be in the holiday spirit? Yeah. I guess I'm just feeling a little conflicted about Christmas this year, that's all. - Oh, 'cause Max is Jewish? - What? No, because it's my first Christmas without my father. - Oh, yeah. - That. Look, it's gonna be tough but you have to focus on the things that you do have. You have a man. - Yes. - I have a man. You do. My man has kids who like me and I like them. That is a Christmas miracle in itself. So, are all of those gifts for Perry's kids? Oh, no, these are the stocking stuffers. I'm having the good stuff wrapped as we speak. - Can I have the stomp rocket? - Absolutely not. Okay, I'm happy you're happy. - [SIGHS] - Truly. Just know that, you know, this year might not be quite as great for me as it is for you. Okay Zo, ho-ho. I will not rub my Christmas joy in your face. I'll just keep it all bottled up to myself, hmm.

I think I got them so I could tell you how awesome they are. - [SNORES] - No, no, no, I mean it. Ask me how many people I've already helped after hearing their heart songs today. - How many people have you... - Three. And it was super easy too. Like I heard this one woman singing "Umbrella" because she thought it might rain outside. So you know what I did? - Gave her an umbrella? - I gave her an umbrella. And she was so appreciative, she told me she was gonna tell all of her friends to come to the restaurant. - That is so great, Max. I think it's awesome. The powers are creating future revenue. Hey, maybe that's why you got 'em. Don't take this the wrong way, but I have no idea why you've had so many challenges with the powers in the past. Because they're kind of the best thing ever. Okay, you say that now, but wait until all your employees are singing a song about how much they hate you or a stranger reveals the darkest depths of their soul to you in the supermarket check-out line. Or sing "Pour Some Sugar on Me" in the bedroom? - Hey! You know, don't get cocky! I was probably just feeling a little hypoglycemic at the time. Ooh, ooh, before you go to work, - can I tell you another one? - Go for it. So, I saw some hungry looking teenagers sing "Cake by the Ocean" so you know what I did? You got them a cake. And showed them where the ocean was. Boom, nailed it. [PERCUSSIVE MUSIC] ♪ ♪ Is it just me or does a whole food bar devoted to peppermint bark feel like a bit of a stretch? Huh, I mean I'd take it over the "Pumpkin Bar" Bar that we had on Halloween. Can I talk to you about something? Dude, is this entire food bar all peppermint bark? Sweet. - Walk with me. - Yeah. Yeah. Okay, so this year is gonna be the first Christmas without my dad. And Christmas and my father are, like, synonymous in my mind. So, since you've already gone through year one, any advice? And go. Ooh, well, I think there's only two ways to approach it. Either you go all in remembering your father. Honoring him completely. - Or? - Avoid it at all costs. - Okay. - What did you do? I went on a yoga retreat by myself without any cell service. [LAUGHS] So what does that tell you? That I should bury my head in the sand until at least January 2nd? Have you talked to your family about this yet? Found out what they wanna do? No, we haven't discussed it. Well, considering Christmas is a week away, you might wanna get on that. How crazy is it that it's the middle of December and we're eating outside? Does anyone know the last time it snowed in San Francisco, anybody? This is a trick question. It's never snowed in San Francisco. Actually not a trick question. David? Don't care. - Maggie? - The answer is 1976. - Maggie for the win. - It was 1976. How'd you know that? Because it happened the same night I went to see the Grateful Dead at the Winterland. And I was so high when I came out of that arena that I didn't know if it was snowing or I was hallucinating. I will never forget that. - Okay. - So, there's actually reason I wanted us all to have dinner together tonight. - You're pregnant? - You're engaged? You're pregnant so you got engaged? - What? - No. It's that Christmas Eve is a week away and we haven't even discussed our plans yet. And I know that it's gonna be very different this year without Dad, but we do have to figure it out at some point. So are we doing what we always do or... What? Um, yeah, well, actually we've been wanting to talk to you about this too. "We"? You've all been having these conversations without me? That was... see, it's kind of a funny story. Emily, why don't you go ahead and take this one? - Coward. - So, my sister is living at this amazing artist retreat in Santa Fe right now and asked if we'd like to come join her. And, yeah, Emily's been so busy with work. And David's been on constant baby duty. We've just been like two trains passing in the night. So we just thought it'd be nice to take, like, a trip to Santa Fe just to like mix things up a little bit. And avoid thinking about Dad at all? Yeah, that did also cross my mind. Yeah. - Mom? - Oh, well, I didn't know what you and Max were thinking and Deb did invite me to come with her to a health and wellness resort in Hawaii, and I always knew this was gonna be a tough holiday and I thought, well, maybe it would be good to get away and by myself a little bit. But I didn't say yes and I'm not gonna go unless I have your blessing. So what do you think?

[TENSE MUSIC] So, I heard you sing a heart song at dinner. - Did you? - I did. - Oh, my gosh. - Was it "Apples and Bananas," so you decided to pass the fruit? That's funny but no. It was actually "Bad Blood" by Taylor Swift. And you seemed pretty upset with your family about not spending the holidays together. - That was the takeaway? - Not really sure there's too many other interpretations there. - Okay. - You know what? I will admit it. I had some... feelings when my family told me their plans. They just... they caught me off-guard, okay? We've never spent Christmas apart, so maybe I had a, you know, momentary visceral response. Well, there was also a high kick involved and you acted a bit like a... like a matador. Okay, I appreciate you trying to analyze my heart song. But there is far more nuance to this whole heart song thing than you realize. You're allowed to feel mad and hurt for a second and then have that impulse go away. - Right. - But has it gone away? - Yeah. - Yeah. Everyone should be able to do what they want for the holidays. Totally was in the right and it's not fair for me to be mad at them about it. I'm sorry everyone's doing their own thing. That must be really hard. I just want you to be happy. So, whatever you wanna do for Christmas is fine with me. [SOFT SENTIMENTAL MUSIC] - Well, in that case... - and no pressure... but you better plan something awesome. Okay. - What are you doing? - Stop being so nosy. There are way too many presents in here with my name on them. I think the correct response is, "Thank you, Mo." But I haven't gotten you anything yet. You are way too hard to shop for. - [PHONE BUZZING] - I don't think so. Anything with Gucci, Balenciaga, Dior on it will do just fine. Who's texting you so much? Phone was buzzing all night long. Is this you being less nosy? It's just lots of questions about "Christmas Carol-oke." Is one of the questions what is Christmas Carol-oke? It is an annual dinner karaoke night I throw for friends who don't have family to be with on the holidays. Kind of a "Island of Misfit Boys" type of thing. Only this year I think I'm gonna pass. - Why would you do that? - Because I have my own family to worry about so they're out of luck. - No way. - I do not wanna be the one kicking people out for Christmas. And that is why I am with you. It's not 'cause of the beard? Oh, baby, the beard definitely does help. [LAUGHS] I'll catch you later. Oh, is there any way you could pick Amirah up at the community center around 4:00? I've got this big firemen's end of the year party and those things can get pretty lit. You want me to pick up your daughter? Yeah. I like you being more involved in my kids' lives. Plus Amirah is rehearsing for the big holiday pageant. Maybe you can give her some tips. You know, normally I am way more materialistic than this but you trusting me with your children is the greatest Christmas present of all. Bye. - Bye. - [LAUGHS] - Whew. - It is a nail biter. I'm feeling a lot of pressure, folks. I do not wanna make the wrong decision and forever alter the dynamics around here. ♪ ♪ Falling Water is... but it is hard to deny the Bilbao Guggenheim. ♪ ♪ You know what, I'm gonna go with the Commodore 64 Home Computer. - Whoo, yeah! - Uh!

Oh, before you all scatter to the winds, I wanted to play you a message from our fearless leader. Hello. Sorry I couldn't be with you today but when the Space Shuttle takes off, it takes off. I just wanted to say that I hope all of your Christmases are astronomical or, you know, whatever holiday you celebrate. You know, the point is Sprq Point's inclusive. It's tolerant. It's accepting of all people. Hence the non-denominational holiday sweaters I had made and strongly encouraged you to wear today. Anyway, thank you for your service. I guess I'll see you all after another trip around the sun. No, really, let's go around the sun one more time. Is anyone else hot? Toni? Toni, do you have... is there A/C? - Have a great break everyone. - I'm really sweating now. - Hey. - Hey. So, did you and your family figure out what you're going to do? - We sure did. - We sure did. We are all going our separate ways this year. And how are you feeling about that? - It's... - it's fine. Mm-hmm. I mean, maybe it's better because I don't wanna just dwell on the sadness, you know. What about you? What are you doing? Something wild and crazy I hope. I'm meeting up with my mom and her new husband in Vegas which should be weird. - Very weird. - Yeah. I'll try to check in with you. I just... I hope you're able to find some joy over the holidays. - You too. - [LAUGHS] Thanks, Simon. - Yeah. - But, you know, what? Who needs to be with family anyway? Not me, said the flea. [CHUCKLES] Hey, gang. Uh, I just wanted to come and say goodbye. Anybody got any big vacation plans? Come on, some of you must be doing something fun. Gingerbread man, what about you? Uh, I'm just going bird watching with my brothers and parents at an incredible wildlife refuge in New Mexico. Wow. But I'm sure it's gonna be terrible. Uh, okay. Speaking of birds, what are you two lovebirds doing? We're going skiing with my whole extended fam. Mac's about to meet all the Batras! - That should be fun, right? - Oh, yeah. As long as she stays away from my Uncle Jimmy. Truthfully, I think the whole skiing industrial complex is a real racket anyway, so it's probably gonna be pretty lame. I see what's going on here. You all are trying to downplay your vacation so I don't feel bad about mine, is that it? You don't have to do that. Really. No, it's not what we're doing. It's not? Uh, I'm actually pretty sure that most of us would prefer to be here, working, with you.

I caused all that suffering. Max, the pain was there. The pain is always there. That's what grief and mourning is. But it's getting better and it's gonna keep getting better, I know it. Yeah, you know what's not gonna get better? All of this guilt and shame I now have inside of me. All because of a broken snow globe? No, because of the way I treated you ever since the moment you told me you had this power. Honestly, how many times have I hammered you over the lack of equality in our relationship? All because you could hear my heart songs and I couldn't hear yours? I was so focused on how your powers made me feel that I never thought about the toll they took on you. And that sucks. Because this... is so much for one human being to take on. - It is. - It's a lot to carry. And, uh, sometimes other people's pain can be... overwhelming. Which is why I should have been more understanding of you. I'm so sorry for how I acted. Max, listen to me. There's no way you could have known what it's like... ♪ ♪ Unless... - Max... - Hmm? What if this is why you got the power? So that you could feel what I feel and understand what I experience every day. And if empathy is the reason the universe gave you this, then... we are just going to keep getting stronger and stronger. Because...

Okay, so I was thinking about it all night especially... - Hmm. - After Jack and Deb, you know, bought all our ridiculous lies - and Zoey got in my head and... - Mm-hmm. I actually... I wrote a different letter, and I was thinking that maybe we should send this one instead. - Okay. - "Hey, Adam. "We were gonna send you a fake newsletter "saying all the amazing things we did this year. But that's not true. We had a really tough year." "My dad died. "I left my job. "Emily suffered from some very intense postpartum depression. "If anything, we were all just trying to... "get by. "But here's the thing: we're still here. "We can still make each other laugh. "We have a great kid. "And we don't need to pretend our life is better "just for your benefit. So have a great holiday and maybe take us off the Christmas list next year." Wow, David. That's, um... that's very brave. And heartfelt. It's very powerful, babe. You still think we should send the other one, don't you? - Most definitely. - Yeah. [CHUCKLES] Okay, yes, I may have opened up a few of the gifts and I know that wasn't part of the plan, but before you say anything, just... - Don't worry about it. - Oh. - What... does that mean? - Is this a test? Like an escape room where they actually kill you? - No. - [LAUGHS] It's fine, really. It is, for real. - Oh, okay. - So, uh, now what? We're going to like just, uh, wait for Mom and open up the rest of the gifts? Make pancakes... Do our annual Christmas nap and then... - I have a different idea. - Instead of doing what we always do, I think it's time we mixed it up. Bring in some new traditions. Try something else for Christmas.

Uh, they just wanna make sure you don't burn down our restaurant. Oh, wait, no, that was actually me. - Hmm. - Mwah. - Thank you for having us. - The place looks amazing. - "Hi, Aunt Mo! - I'm drunk on breast milk!" Oh, can I get you guys anything? - No, no, no, go, we are good. - We're fine. - Okay. - [LAUGHS] You do know your entire workplace is here, right? That might be Max's fault. I think he posted the party on Instagram and they'll show up to anything. And what is your excuse? Because this party is for lost souls with nowhere else to go. - Yeah, that sounds just right. - [LAUGHS] Also I can't think of any place I'd rather be. You mean it? [LAUGHS] With that, go find your light and make some memories and sing something. Except "Sweet Caroline." That song sucks. - I love that song. - [LAUGHS] Do you wanna get a drink? - Yes. - Oh, no! Oh, Tobin! The ski trip, what happened? - Oh, this is nothing. - You should see the other guy! - You mean the mountain? - Yeah. - Oh, hey! - It's the Clarkemans! Hey! Uh, how was birding with the family? Oh, incredible! We got a photo of the rare two-eared quetzal. And I called my ex at the Audobon Society and he... - Yeah, that sounds super cool! - We're gonna grab a drink. Right, he was, like, oh, yeah, no, we can do the thing. - Okay. - What's up, bro? [LAUGHS] You don't have a drink in your hand. What can I make the two of you? - Mezcal mule for me, bruh. - Glass of wine. - Done and done. - Hi. Okay. So, Christmas Eve with mom and the new husband. How was it? - I'm not gonna lie. - It was a little weird at first but... it was nice seeing my mom so happy. Which I guess is all that matters, right? - Oh, before I forget... - Yes. I brought you both back souvenirs. - Oh. - Thank you. - Max. - Presents. Bro, I got you some "I heart Las Vegas" golf balls because I think it's time we start playing a sport together which you, of course, will lose. [LAUGHS] I will see you on the greens, pal! - Okay. - And for you... Now, no matter what you're feeling over the holidays, you can always look at this, shake it up, and think "At least I'm not in Vegas." - Did you tell him? - I...

[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] Ooh, and I can already tell I like this venue more than my apartment. And we will see you all next year, okay? And with that, let's give a round of applause to my partner in crime, Max... for graciously saying "Yes" for this magical evening and for splitting the liquor and food bill without knowing. Oh, in that case, party's over, everybody! Have a great night. Kidding. We all know that the holidays are about family, whether it be your family or your chosen family. And no Mo-ccasion would be complete without a little ♪ song ♪ But... [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] This year, we're gonna do things a little different because someone that I care so much about didn't get her chance to shine so, Amirah, will you come up here and sing a song for us? [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] - [LAUGHS] - What do you wanna sing? And she has taste. I like it. She got that from me, Perry.
