I want you to listen to me. I want you to go out of the house and down the street to the MacKenzies' house? I want you to knock on their door, I want you to tell them to call the police and send them over here. All right? What... Now do as I say! Yeah. Go! Come on! Come on! Was that the boogie man? As a matter of fact, it was. What's going on out here? Call the police. Tell the sheriff I shot him. Who? Tell him he's still on the loose! Is this some kind of joke? I've been trick or treated to death tonight. You don't know what death is. Trick or treat! - I shot him six times! - What? I said I shot him six times! I shot him in the heart and... He can't have gotten very far. Come on. I shot him six times. Yeah, I know. This guy, this man... He's not human! Harold, you want mayonnaise on your sandwich? How about mustard? Oh, Harold... a morsel of mind-melting madness, Night of the Living Dead. Are you asleep again? This is a WWAR special bulletin. Police in Haddonfield have just made the grisly discovery of three bodies in the upstairs bedrooms of this house. It appears that the murders took place sometime early this evening. Authorities have confirmed that all three of the victims are teenagers, two girls and a boy. Police are searching the entire area for a mental patient who escaped last night from the Smith's Grove-Warren County Sanitarium. He is now believed to be at large in Haddonfield. This is Robert Mundy live. They're coming to get you, Barbara! WOMAN". Stop it! You're ignorant! They're coming for you, Barbara! Stop it! You're acting like a child! They're coming for you! Look, there comes one of them now! He'll hear you! Here he comes now! I'm getting out of here! Mrs. Elrod? Mr. Elrod? Are you okay? Hi. There was someone screaming next door. Yeah, Mr. and Mrs. Elrod. His wife's always picking on him. He probably got angry and decided to start beating her. Oh, big deal. Are your folks home? They are gone. My dad had to take my Aunt Ruby to Hardin County and my mother decided to go along. Didn't you hear? Hear about what? Some girl got killed in Haddonfield. It's on the radio. Hold on. ON RADIO ...so the police have cordoned off the entire area. To repeat: Three teenagers have been found murdered in a house in the northwest section of Haddonfield. The names of the teenagers have not been released. I can't believe it. I know. You know, we probably knew her. Where did it happen? Down on Orange Grove. That's right down the street. I know. Police confirmed the girl was rescued as she fought... Sally, I can hear the sirens coming. They said the guy got away. Do they know who it was? No. Oh, God. Alice? Alice? What's wrong? Alice? Who is it? Alice? Where are you? Who is it? Gary Hunt of the Haddonfield Police Department says he believes the suspect will be apprehended within a matter of hours. Neighbors said they heard screams during the early evening but attributed the noise to the usual Halloween... I'm asking, what's going on? Inside, guys, will you? All right, folks, give them room, will you, please? Laurie, can you hear me? Don't let them put me to sleep. It's all right, take it easy. We're gonna go to the clinic, all right? Don't let them put me to sleep. It's okay. Hey, you know this chick? Yeah, her name's Laurie Strode. She goes to school with my little brother Ziggy. Her old man Strode Realty? Yeah. Okay. Okay, just get out easy. It's gonna be okay. Walk real slow, okay? Are you all right? You all right, hon? Oh, God! Here, just put it up there real gently. You okay? Let's go. Just walk real slow. Come on. Fill out this form. Someone will be with you in a moment. Well, we should see a doctor right away. He's with a patient. Would you please wait in Room A? Oh, come on, honey. Thank you. Where's Dr. Mixter? He's been at the Country Club. I think he's drunk. Oh, great. What have you got? Stab wound left anterior chest. Possibly penetrating. Multiple contusions. It's Laurie Strode. Yeah, yeah, come on, let's go. Possibly fractured right ankle. Janet, get me some more coffee. Get that out of here. Oh, Laurie, hi, there! Well, let's see what we have here. Ah, yes. You've lost a lot of blood. We'll need to type it. Yeah. When was the last time you had a tetanus shot? I don't know. Get me some 3-0 nylon on a... Cutting needle? Yes. Right away. We're going to have to put her out. No! No, don't put me to sleep! Okay, relax. Relax, we're not gonna hurt you. No! No! Please, don't put me to sleep. Take it easy. Try to relax, Laurie. Dr. Mixter will have you stitched up in no time. Take it easy, Laurie. Circle the block again. How long now? It's about 30 minutes. Put the light down there. There, by those trees. There's nothing. Well, keep going! You know, Doctor, I'm just about there. What? The point where I stop taking orders from you. All right, Sheriff, whatever you want. The primary concern is that we stop him! You let him out. I didn't. His own goddamn doctor! I didn't let him out. Chief Brackett, come in, please. Chief Brackett, come in, please. Who is it? Chief, this is... Say again, what is it? This is Ramsey. Where are you? I'm out by the bakery moving north on the Scottsville Road. Get the hell back into town. Go up 17th Street and meet me by the Bypass. 10-4, Ramsey clear. Will you put that thing away? You couldn't have shot him six times. You think I'm lying, Sheriff? I think you missed him. No man could take six slugs. I'm telling you, this isn't a man! Look out, slow down! Over there! Look, look, look! Why? Is that him? I don't know. Get back! Run! Go on, run! Dr. Loomis! Get back! Get back, you kids! Run! Stop! Get out... Dr. Loomis! Loomis! Stop! Stop! Don't shoot! Stop! Don't... Get him. Sheriff Brackett. He came out of nowhere. I couldn't stop. Is it him? I don't know. Is it him or not? Leigh, Leigh, they found three bodies. Where? Across the street from the Doyle house. Three kids. Leigh, one of them was Annie! What? Does it hurt a lot? What? Oh, sweetie, I can't understand you! Look, it'll be okay. We'll play some games tonight, and... Repeating for those of you who just tuned in, three people are dead tonight as the result of an attack by an escaped mental patient. I understand we're going to stay on the air now. Repeating for those of you who just tuned in. Three people are dead tonight as the result of an attack by an escaped mental patient. Any further details will be forthcoming as soon as we get them. This is Robert Mundy reporting to you live. Hi. Hi. Jimmy, leave her alone. Well, how are you feeling? Sore. What happened? Cracked a bone. You're lucky it wasn't a break. Dr. Mixter felt that he should wait until tomorrow before he put a cast on. You have to get some rest. Come on, Jimmy. Can I get you something to drink or anything? How about a Coke? Okay. Thanks. Okay. Come on, Jimmy, we gotta roll. Another call come in. Okay. Okay. Come on. Get you that Coke later. Out! Moments ago, police reported that Michael Myers, formerly of Haddonfield, who fled the Smith's Grove-Warren County Sanitarium last night, was believed to have burned to death. Meanwhile, three bodies were discovered in the upstairs bedroom of the house directly behind me. Identification of the victims is being withheld pending notification... Forget that. Forget that. I wanna concentrate on the house. Talk to some kids. See if anybody saw anything. All right, you need their parents' permission to use a statement. If you can't find the parents, get a statement anyway. Not now. Just a minute, fellas. I have to go and tell my wife before somebody else does. Go on home, Leigh. Go on home. I'll take care of everything. Damn you! I'm sorry. What have you done? I haven't done anything. You let him out! I didn't let him out, I gave orders for him to be restrained. Now is there anything else that we can do for you'? If that wasn't Michael Myers burning up in that car, then a lot of other kids are gonna be slaughtered tonight. He's dead! I saw him! You saw a man in a mask. It was him. I wanna believe you, but I got to be sure. I can't stop until I'm certain that he's dead. You're talking about him like he's some kind of animal. He was my... Would you keep it back? He was my patient for 15 years. He became an obsession with me until I realized that there was nothing within him, neither conscience nor reason, that was even remotely human. An hour ago I stood up and fired six shots into him. He just got up and walked away. I am talking about the real possibility that he is still out there! Where'd they take the body? Coroner's office. Get a dentist to meet me there in half an hour. In spite of the fact that the man who rescued Laurie Strode claims to have shot him six times at close range, Haddonfield police have no explanation for the suspect's disappearance, but say they're confident he will be captured soon. Paramedics are now removing the last of the three bodies-I cannot believe it. Pin the Tail on the Donkey and bobbing for apples. Actually bobbing in water, no less. Well, you gotta use water. See, if you don't use water... I'm never going to another Halloween party as long as I live, especially not at Stevie Mathis' house. And, of course, now I'm gonna be late. Well, you gotta drive me home first. Oh, Darcy, I don't have time. Well, you've got to. Oh, can't you ask Eddie Lee? He's in Russellville. It's five minutes to your house, another five minutes back to the hospital. Mrs. Alves is gonna kill me. You promised me. I know I did. There is one survivor. Seventeen-year-old Laurie Strode was found directly across the street from the home where the murders took place. The teenager was taken across town to Haddonfield Memorial Clinic. In the aftermath of the killings, the streets between Chestnut and 10th are jammed with people and cars. Repeating that these streets are Chestnut and 10th. They're just jammed with both people and cars. Boy, I sure could go for a pizza now. A nice big one with sausage, onions, peppers. But no mushrooms. I hate mushrooms. The names of the young victims have not yet been released, but the people in the crowd have recognized them as neighborhood teenagers. Looks like a goddamn homecoming. Now back to Dementia! Thanks, Mr. Garrett. Julie saw him, you know. Who? Michael Myers. Come on. I swear! Yesterday, when she was coming to work! Where did she see him? You know the Shop n Bag out by the mall? Well, she stopped at a light and saw him walking in that field behind the Lost River drive-in. Julie said he was so creepy. Julie's full of shit! He didn't escape until last night. Well, you don't have to swear, Budd. Well, she's a goddamn moron, anyway. Every other word you say is either "hell" or "shit" or "damn"! I'm sorry. I guess I just fuck up all the time. Hi. You're late. Yeah, I know. I've gotta get on the ward. Hi, Jimmy. Oh, hi, Karen. See you later. Right. Amazing grace Come sit on my face Don't make me cry I need your pie... Look, why don't you just shut up, all right? What are you all revved up about? Look, it could have been Ziggy, you know. And it could have been your brother Mark we pulled out of there. All right, so what do you want me to do? Look, Jimmy, rule number one, never get involved with a patient. Nurses, that's another story, but patients, it's no good. It never works out. Where you going, college boy? I'm telling you, listen to old Budd. You were late again tonight. Just 15 minutes. That could be the difference between life and death for one of those kids. You're right, I'm sorry, Mrs. Alves. It's just that I... I don't wanna hear any excuses. You're a good nurse, Karen, I'd hate to lose you, but you've got to learn to be on time. Now let's go over this list. It'll be fine, really, I promise. I'm very sorry. Carr, Mrs. Carr, 9:30 tomorrow morning. God, they should have... They should have handled him more carefully. Who? Michael Myers. Michael Myers? Yeah, he was the guy that was after you. You mean, the Myers house? That little kid who killed his sister? Yeah. But he's in a hospital somewhere. He escaped last night. How do you know? It's all over the radio. Television, too. It's on right now. Why me? I mean, why me? Time's up, Jimmy. Let's go. Okay, okay. I'll be back... No, you won't! Visiting hours are definitely over! Men, you can't live with them, you can't live without them. How's that shoulder feel? Better. Good. We've been trying to get a hold of your parents. Dr. Mixter told me they were at the same party he was, but they're not there now and they're not at home. Do you have any idea where else they might be? No. I'll just keep trying then. Oh, this is just... Janet? Yes, Mrs. Alves? Go tell Mr. Garrett we're having trouble with the phones. Right now. But he's at the other end of the hall. Janet Yes, Mrs. Alves. What's wrong with the phones? Nothing for you to worry about. Just get some rest right now. I'll let you know as soon as we get ahold of your parents. I'm gonna go check the pole. You wait here and I'll call you. I have to get back on the floor. It'll take me five minutes. But I don't even know how to use this thing. I think somebody broke into the storeroom. The lock was off. Mr. Garrett? I can't hear you. One of you had better drive down to the sheriff's station right away. Mr. Garrett, how do you work this thing? Janet? Mr. Garrett? Mr. Garrett? Mr. Garrett, I gotta get back on the floor! Hello? It's difficult, even the gums are charred, but look here. See here'? No fillings. He's young, maybe 17, maybe 18. Michael Myers is 21. Positive I.D. means we check X-rays and dental records. That'll take hours. No other way to know for sure. I'm sorry. We haven't got hours. Listen to me. We've got to assume that Michael Myers is still alive. Everybody goes back out. But we just closed it up. I want a sweep from Chestnut South to the Bypass. I want every street, every house, every backyard... Okay. You got it. Thank you. All right, that's enough! That's enough! Come on, get out of here, you guys. Go home. You guys get out of here. Go on. This is Hunt. Send another vehicle. The old Myers house, 45 Lampkin Lane. The tribe. One of their number was butchered. This is the wake. Heightens my sense of security. All right, knock it off! Come on, folks, go home! Somebody get rid of it! Knock it off! Empty. Plus we covered the whole east end of town. Nothing. Check it again. He just isn't there! Check it again! You know, Haddonfield was a pretty quiet town before tonight. The only gunshots you ever heard were to start the track meet at the local high school. Yet one night in 1963, Michael Myers did murder his sister in that upstairs bedroom with a large butcher knife. I remember. On Halloween. I was 16 years old. It's his anniversary, Mr. Hunt. He came back. After 15 years? He waited with extraordinary patience. There was a force inside him biding its time. The staff grew accustomed to his immobility and silence. In many ways, he was the ideal patient. He didn't talk, he didn't cry, he didn't even move. He just waited. The staff was unprepared. They didn't know what he was. Did you know? Yeah, I knew. Excuse me. Mr. Hunt? Yeah, what is it, Craig? Yeah, I'm worried about Bennett Tramer. He isn't home yet. Yeah, and he left the party at 10:00. It's only a little after 11:00, boys. He was real drunk. How old is he? Seventeen. He had this stupid mask on. All right, boys. Seventeen? And wearing a mask. Oh, God! Maybe we should check his dental records. Old Reservoir Road. They had a break-in at the elementary school. They're pretty sure it's him. Come on. Stop! OW! Shit! Shit! Oh, you idiot! You could've broken it. I wish I had! I also could have used these on you! What an asshole! Happy Halloween! Budd, you are the biggest jerk I've ever met! But you love me. Yeah, and I'm an idiot. Let's go down to the therapy room. Budd's finger needs a little bit of therapy. I can't leave the kids right now. But every/body's all weirded out tonight. All this Michael Myers crap. I just... I just want... The therapy room is three doors down. I suppose if we left the door open, we could hear if somebody was coming, or if one of the kids started to cry. No, I've gotta check it out first. Fifteen minutes. If everything's okay. You're wasting time. Why won't you tell me? Why won't you ever tell me anything? I told you, I'm not your mother. It's hot. Whew! It's hot in here. It's just me. I'm not kidding. It's too hot in here now, Budd. Why don't you go check it? It's cold out there. It can get cold in here. Gotcha. Forget it, Budd. I have to go back to work. Do you wanna go for breakfast later? I'm sorry. I just have to get back, that's all. Now, Budd, don't be that way. No! Oh, God! He got in here. And look over here. And here. Sister. Is that it? No. Here. What's this? It's gibberish. No. It's a Celtic word. It means, "The Lord of the Dead." "The end of summer." The festival of Samhain, October 31st. Dr. Loomis? Yes? I have to talk to you. Oh, I didn't recognize you. What are you doing here? Privately. Thanks. Dr. Loomis, you've been ordered back to Smiths-Grove. Ordered? They can't order me. No, no, but the Governor can. He spoke to Dr. Rogers personally a few hours ago. The Governor? Well, well. Dr. Loomis, this thing is all over the state. Your patient escapes once, murders three teenagers, you shoot him with a gun, he escapes again! Someone should have listened to me earlier. I know, I'm sorry. Dr. Rogers is just afraid this could jeopardize our whole rehabilitation program. He doesn't want anyone from the Mental Health Department anywhere near Haddonfield. Why did he send you down here then? In case you'd already found him alive. Tell Dr. Rogers... Tell him you couldn't find me. Tell him anything. I can't leave Haddonfield now. I'm afraid you don't have a choice. There's a marshal waiting for you outside. Laurie? Listen, I know that you don't know me very well, but I just wanna let you know that I'm not gonna let anything happen to you. Okay? Promise. Laurie? Shit! Dr. Mixter? Dr. Mixter? Dr. Mixter! Dr. Mixter? Dr. Mixter? It's an emergency. Dr. Mixter, it's Laurie Strode. She's had a reaction to the medication. You better come quick! Dr. Mixter. This is ridiculous! I'm gonna go find Mrs. Alves. Mrs. Alves? Laurie? You okay? We'll find him. Where you gonna look? I don't know. Neither do I. Mr. Garrett? Mr. Garrett? Mr. Garrett? Mr. Garrett? Sorry. Listen, I can't find anybody. Budd's gone, Mrs. Alves is gone. We gotta find Laurie. All right, listen... I want you to check the East Wing again, all right? And if you don't find anybody, I want you to get into your oar and drive out to the sheriff's station and get someone out here, all right? Okay. Okay. I'll keep looking. Hello? Jesus! Laurie! Laurie! Laurie, wait! Wait, Laurie! Come on! You didn't believe me. Nobody did. I'm sorry. Don't feel sorry for me, feel sorry for that little town back there. It'll be years before they forget this. Dr. Loomis, I think there's something else you should know. Did you see the blackboard back there at the elementary school? Yeah. In order to appease the gods, the Druid priests held fire rituals. Prisoners of war, criminals, the insane, animals were burned alive in baskets. By observing the way they died, the Druids believed they could see omens of the future. Two thousand years later we've come no further. Samhain isn't the evil spirit. It isn't goblins and ghosts or witches, it's the unconscious mind. We're all afraid of the dark inside ourselves. Dr. Loomis, please, listen to me. There's a file on Michael Myers that nobody knew about. I've seen everything. No! No, it was hidden, sealed by the court after his parents were killed. Now, after the Governor heard what happened tonight, he authorized Dr. Rogers to open it. What file? It isn't fair. They should have allowed you to examine everything. That girl, that Strode girl, that's Michael Myers' sister! She was born two years before he was committed. Two years after, his parents died, and she was adopted by the Strodes. They requested that the records be sealed in order to protect the family. Jesus, don't you see what he's doing here in Haddonfield? He killed one sister 15 years ago, now he's trying to kill the other! Tonight, after I shot him, where did they take her? The clinic. The clinic? Where... Do you know this area well? A little bit. Where is the hospital located? Dr. Loomis, we're under orders from the Governor. It's back on Route 17, about three miles. Turn this car around, now! I can't do that. I've got orders! Those orders just changed! Dr. Loomis! Doctor, you're getting yourself into a lot of trouble. What is it you fellows usually do? Fire a warning shot, right? Jimmy? It's all right. We're... We're gonna get out of here. I think... I ought to handcuff you to the wheel, but I have a feeling I'm going to need you in there. Can I trust you? What have I got to lose except my job? Help me. Help! Help! Help me! Go and check all the rooms down there. Go on! Dr. Loomis! You stay with me and shut up! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Please! Please! Please! Help! Help me! Come on, get in! Stop! He's dead. No, he's not! Look at him! He's still breathing! Okay. There's a two-way radio in the marshal's car. I want you to go outside, get on that radio and get Hunt! Now, wait a minute! I'm the only one authorized to use that. Move! I'm sorry I left you. Are you all right? Why won't he die? Get away from him! But he stopped breathing! No! Unit calling, identify. Marion Chambers with Dr. Loomis at the clinic. He's here. 10-4. Unit calling, identify suspect. Michael Myers! Just get your ass over here! Come on, come on, come on. No! Take it. No! Take it! Michael? Michael, stop! He's an animal! He's an animal! Go on, get out. Get out, now! It's time, Michael. What's the count? Ten, so far. If I could just get a word or two. - Do you have any first-hand information... - Just leave her alone. About what happened inside the hospital? Can't I ride in front? Oh, no, I'm sorry. I have to put you in back. You ready? Watch out for your feet. She's now being assisted out of the wheelchair... Up we go. Careful. And foot. And into the ambulance. Big step. Big step. Okay. Keep the leg up, we'll have you out of here in a second. Okay.
