[silence] I have some lard in the pan, ladies and gentlemen, and I'’m putting in... finely chopped white onion, not too much. Now this is pork frijoles refritos as I learned to do them in the capital many, many years ago. Now when your onion is transparent, then you'’ll want to add your beans with their broth and mash them down. Now this, you think, may take a long time, but you know we need things that take a long time, occasionally. You can turn on your cooking cassette and amuse yourself in the kitchen. You can solve problems as you mash the beans. You know cooking is great therapy. [Narrator] The Art of Mexican Cooking with Diana Kennedy will return. [Muted vocal sounds] Yeah, I usually walk a bit faster, but you'’ll have to... [Dog barking] Oh, shit! This damn shoe! I can never remember the turns I'’ve done. So what do I do? I have 10 leaves. I'’m gonna do 10 turns. And here, I'’ve done one, so one leaf goes on this side. [Birds calling, dog barking] [Theme music comes up] All my life, I'’ve cooked. We had to cook. From around 6 or 7, we were in the kitchen with my mother cooking. [Theme music continues] [Theme music fades out] I'’ve had a very funny life. Let'’s face it. Drifted from one post to the other. Nobody has really said, "You do this or you do that." Somebody will suggest something and I'’m off. [Car horn] I'’m not going to be killed or maimed by some idiot who doesn'’t know how to drive on a country road. I wish my truck could recount some of the experiences they have been through with me. Hailstones, floods, landslides... You name it, we'’ve been through it together. One is never satisfied. There'’s so much more I'’d like to do. I'’ve traveled in my truck all over this country from Chihuahua into Yucatán, many, many, many times. As I drive, I think about things, and I plan what I'’m going to do, or what I hope to find at the next stop. I'’ve got my rhythm traveling. I know which way I'’m going. I don'’t always know where I'’m going to stop. And I'’m basically very selfish anyway. I don'’t want to share some experiences. When there are two people, your experience isn'’t the same as one. I never had a car at the beginning. I used to go on 3rd class buses with the chickens and the pigs. But I'’d always get a recipe, always get a recipe. [Theme music comes up] Not always getting all I wanted, but it was then reasonable to do and and I used up any savings I had on doing that. That'’s why I'm so pissed off when people plagiarize my recipes. They didn'’t do the research. I'’ve done the research. Anything to escape and to learn. Each colonial had a market, and in these markets, that was the very center of food. So we had very fresh stuff coming in from the areas around, and so I would ask anybody I could in the market where they came from, what they were cooking, how they cooked their ingredients. I took an interest in their food, in what their family were eating, how they got their food, what were the local chillies, what were the local fruits, what were the local herbs they were using. I felt I was at home immediately wherever I went. With eight amazing books on Mexican cooking and culture, it can be said that the author, Diana Kennedy'’s knowledge and passion for Mexican cooking is unsurpassed. Thank you, Martha... You are the classic. You'’re books are classics, but you are the classic. It'’s really a great pleasure and everyone is so excited here to work with you. Thank you so much. So what are we going to make today from this book? I think, because it'’s very difficult, to get some of the materials for tamales, we'’ll make one that I think's great fun to make and very, very popular tamale in Oaxaca. And it'’s with black beans. And then, as long as the dough can come cleanly away from the husk... That'’s cooked. Okay. - See? - So here'’s your plate. You want a taste, don'’t you? This is rather hot. But it'’s a wonderful foil for these tamales. [Stewart moaning] Do you like them? They are spectacular. - Good flavor in the bean paste. - Yummy. Wonderful flavor. The salsa is wonderful. It may take a little extra time and effort to make authentic Mexican tamales but... when you taste these, you'’ll know it'’s worth the effort. [Theme music comes up] How can it be that a white, British woman knows more about Mexican food than anybody else? These are the very best calabacitas. I think everybody that meets Diane, they never forget they met her. You have to be Diane and to have the character she has to achieve what she'’s achieved. I think she'’s a legend. Many Mexicans are very against admitting that Diana knows more than they do about their food. She'’s an incredible repository of knowledge. She'’s the person in the English-speaking world that first really mined the richness of regional Mexican cooking. She taught us the very traditional ways and was not doing her own variation. - Hola. - Hola, Javier. Good morning. How are you? She is a prophet for Mexican food. You think about these Old Testament prophets who go around preaching the word and they get burned at the stake. Diana doesn'’t care if people like her. She cares that Mexican food is evangelized, that these things that she saw how they were get remembered and continued. So she's gonna tell you the truth. I think Mexico as a country will be eternally indebted to her efforts. Here... [Diana exclaiming] [Chuckling] It was the war years in England when I was growing up. I feel like I was let loose like an unguided missile. Everybody had to join a service. But because I wouldn'’t salute anybody, I couldn'’t join the Army Corps or the Navy. So the Timber Corps, I joined that, and learned how to, unfortunately, fell trees... And saw them up. I'’ve been planting trees ever since, of course. Most people buy land here and the first thing they do is to cut down the trees. Not here. Nobody'’s allowed to. People come and I want them to realize that we have to live with nature. If we do, nature is very kind to us. The war years taught us an awful lot. We couldn'’t waste a thing. So I was well brought up there in the country in an ecological house, and consider all the things in the world that people don'’t have. After the war, I had been invited by a friend to go to Jamaica. I was propelled by lots and lots of hormones. [Chuckles] In those days, every time the plane stopped in the Caribbean, it was on your ticket. The plane stopped in Ciudad Trujillo, as it then was, Dominican Republic. I was nearly kidnapped, but I managed to escape. Escaped many things. There were two hicks from the middle west in straw hats, I think were fantastic really because they said, "Well if you'’re thinking of stopping in Haiti, "don'’t forget to stay at the Hotel Olofsson." And I did. There was a revolution on, of course, met with army with guns on the airport. We went to the hotel. The hotel was full of correspondents because of this revolution. And the first person I saw was my future husband, Paul Kennedy. Of course, I believe in fate. I mean how was it that we both landed at the same hotel, the same minute? [Chuckling] When I came in to see if there was a room, the hotel owner said, "An English woman, ho-ho-ho. There'’ll be sex tonight." [Cackling] The Mexican expression is "un flechazo." That'’s an arrow shot. He was rather like Spencer Tracy in build, and, of course, the Irish blood. He was just a character that people naturally drifted towards and enjoyed his company. [Theme music comes up] We had an affair and then he was based in Mexico, so I took a steamer back to Mexico. And, of course, I had to change the menu on the boat. [Chuckles] I arrived at Puerto Veracruz on the 13th of October in 1957. And then began this absolutely fascinating time in love and then very quickly became in love with the country that I had come to. [Sound of truck engine] Okay, now we'’re gonna really get us some bumps. [Gasps] [Truck stopping] Okay, kid. That'’s it. Got it? Here you have it. This is with all the little papery skins, you see, that have to come off the coffee before you toast it. And this of course is an antique toaster. This is laughable a lot of people think, but no matter, that'’s how we do it. [Classical music playing on radio] That'’ll go on for about 20 minutes to half an hour, OK? So find yourself a good program to listen to or put your television in the kitchen, but take your time. And of course, most people don'’t have time, so many of the coffees around here are slightly burnt. But anyhow, if you come in the right mood and the right time, you'’ll have a decent cup of coffee if you don'’t invite the guy from Washington Post. [Chuckles] [Classical music on radio comes up] It was 1957. There was no smog. At 2 o'’clock in the afternoon, the city went dead. Everybody was having a long siesta, went back to the office at 5 o'’clock. I remember in Reforma, it wasn'’t paved along the side and there were people riding horses. It was very lovely. We lived together in various places for a year, and then I found the apartment, and I moved in with the furniture. A year later, we were married. I worked at the British Council. All the correspondents arrived and then, of course, I'’d dash home from work and cook for them all. If they came to Mexico, then they came to dinner. It was a very lively household. We used to have some very happy times. Dear Paul, everybody loved Paul. He was so funny when he got drunk. He'’d do Spanish dancing and all sorts of things. And he'’d never had a hangover, ever. I think he thought I was crazy. I certainly wasn'’t the traditional housewife. I never wanted children. I don'’t want to be responsible for somebody. I'd hate to bring up a little me. Can you imagine? I'’m such a freelance, you know. We just have lovers. That seems to... But at this age, you know, men like young flesh. They don'’t like old... withered old flesh, do they? [Chuckles] Oh, shit! [Honking] Ah! The other day, a taxi driver opened the car, his door of the car, but this side, there was a big van so you couldn'’t... maneuver... Adios! [Speaking in Zapotec] [Laughing] [Spanish greeting] The minute I arrived in Mexico, I'd be off to the markets, looking at things. When he was off in his trips, I'd get on 3rd class buses and start wandering around Mexico... And look at the food in the markets. To me, that was the most exciting part, and I thought that is the key to Mexican food, and the key to the real life of Mexico coming into the city. I also was influenced very much by Josefina Velazquez de Leon, who did a series of these regional books. But she would get the recipes from church groups all over the country. They really for the first time revealed that there were regional cuisines. I was interested by that, and many of them, I didn'’t think explained to me enough. I wanted to know how people lived. I wanted to know what their landscape looked like. I wanted to know more. Craig Clairborne, the Food Editor of The New York Times, visited us in Mexico. And I was talking about Mexico and the food I'’d come across. And I offered to give him a Mexican cookbook. And he said, "No. I don'’t want one till you write one." [Theme music comes up with lively beat] Okay, now let'’s do, guess what? An English woman making guacamole? What barbarism! I'’m going to do it the traditional way. No, you don'’t put garlic in, and you don'’t put Kosher salt. Let'’s get it right. I'’m using a molcajete. You may not have a molcajete, but buy one. [Growls] It'’s just as easy to cook it the proper way. We'’re going to put some finely chopped white onion. Not minced! For Chrissake, everybody minces everything, and they leave all the juice on the board! I'’m going to put some finely chopped chile serrano. Keep your hands off the jalapeños, por favor. No jalapeños. Here'’s a full chile serrano. These happen to be from the garden. They'’re totally organic. They'’re a little bit small, but what the hell. Weird seeds and bends, don'’t stop to take those out, '‘cause that'’s crazy. Anybody who says take the seeds out of the serrano, well, they'’re not very good cooks. Then we have some roughly chopped cilantro. People say, "Don'’t like cilantro." Please don'’t invite them. Thick stems you can remove. And, you know, put in the compost, whatever you do with it. Give it to the hens, whatever. We'’re getting this down to a nice base, so we'’re going to crush out those flavors and then we'’ll add the avocado. Whatever you do, don'’t blend your avocado. We want a sort of a lumpy guacamole. We don'’t want a thin, smooth, liquid sauce. In the early days, when I was I demonstrating, some snooty young woman went out of my traditional Mexican cooking class, with her head, with her nose stuck in the air and said, "And even her guacamole was lumpy." That'’s what textures your food. We don'’t want baby food all the time. And do use salt, please! I cannot bear all this saltless cooking. And, finely chopped tomato. If your tomatoes are not very good, look and see what is in the market. Don'’t make your menus up before you see what'’s fresh. Now there is one that you would do with green tomatoes. I had it in one of my books and guess who plagiarized it? Okay, it'’s a secret. There we go. It'’s a dish of guacamole. What'’s wrong with that? It looks all right. [Off camera] Do you taste it, Diana? What am I going to say? "Oh, so delicious!" Nobody'll believe me. You try it. You taste it. All right? [Theme music comes up] Paul was diagnosed with prostate cancer, and it became clear then he had to have treatment. So in 1965, we moved to New York where I was completely lonely and at sea and shell-shocked. So Paul must have thought I was terrible because I didn'’t find the apartment that we moved in, he did. I didn'’t know anybody. I was very sad. And it was Paul'’s last year of suffering, terrible suffering, and he died in February '67. So it was a very sad time, a very wearing time. Paul, obviously, was the great love of my life, yes. He was a very special person. Now here I am and that was our engagement party. The Ambassador of the United States. And, of course, everybody loved him He was such a character. So here he is laughing away and thinking. It reminds me of a past life. You never remarried, obviously. Oh, no. I'’m not the marrying kind. [Sighing] I'’m not the marrying kind. I didn'’t want to have children. How would I, I'’d wonder, how the... You know, females do it and everything all the time, yeah. I worked, you know. [Theme music comes up] There'’s no pension, so I really had to hustle. I was just out of my depth in New York. I didn'’t know anybody. I was very depressed. Craig Claiborne said, "Why don'’t you teach Mexican cooking?" I thought he was crazy. He said, "I want to photograph you for the paper, making papadzules which are a favorite of his, a dish from Yucatán. It'’s like enchiladas with a sauce of pumpkin seeds... very delicate. And so he photographed that for the Times and said, "She will be teaching on Sundays in her apartment." That time I was working at Teacher'’s College of Columbia University, and on Sundays I changed and put on my Toque Blanche and started cooking and teaching. Having six people in my little galley kitchen, cooking up the really traditional food that I remember. There was a dress designer, there was an actress, all sorts of these people who came. And here I was teaching them papadzules. I mean hardly anybody in Mexico knows how to do papadzules, squeezing the oil out of the pepitas seeds. I don'’t know, but anyhow, it was fun. It was a start. An editor at Harper'’s said, "I would like you to do a Mexican cookbook." When I first was pitching this book to my bosses, they were like, "How are we gonna sell "a British woman'’s take on Mexican food?" Yes, yes, but wait till you see what this is. They gave me an advance. I'’d go to Mexico and start really digging in, traveling, very little money. People were coming into Mexico City from the country to find work and I was in touch with many of them, anybody I could talk to. They said, "Oh, we have a family. "They'’ve set in a certain place. "We'’d go on holiday. We'’d go there and "we'’d eat such and such a dish." I said, "Oh, how do you make that dish?" And I said, "Well, I'’d like to go there." So I would get on that bus and I would get there and... "There'’s this English woman coming into our house "sitting there for hours, standing around "and being with us for a week or whatever." They were very kind and very welcoming, and very fascinated that somebody wanted to see the details of, not only cooking that dish, but what the ingredients they were using. You visited the country, what they were foraging for or what they had in their little bit of land and how they transformed those things into their local dishes. And so I would sit there and lap all this up, and make notes and then go back immediately and cook it at home and see what the accents of flavor were. Instead of writing a doctoral thesis, I was doing it in real-time or real life. My first book, "The Cuisines of Mexico," came out in '72. I was asked to give cooking classes all over the States. And so I would travel and that continued for many years. In the '70s, there was a whole growth of cooking schools. That'’s how I met Alice, whom I think is one of the great people in food. It takes a long time for a dish to become classic. What we'’re tasting in the books of Diana Kennedy are the really, really authentic dishes of Mexico. And I think that'’s why she'’s had such an enormous effect on... cooks around the world. All of us at that time, Marcella Hazan, Joyce Chen in New York, Paula Wolfert, have produced seminal books, classic books that have stood the test of time. A recent New York Times editor called us "the talented amateurs." We started something, and we have these wonderful books. [Audience applause] Good morning. Welcome to our show. We'’re glad that you joined us this morning. Our special guest is Diana Kennedy. And she'’s probably, if not the, one of the foremost authorities on Mexican cuisine in the entire country. Diana, good morning. Good to see you. Good morning. Thank you for inviting me. I have been dyin'’ to have this lady on our show so that you would have a chance to know how to cook Mexican food like you have never had before. She has several books. One is entitled "The Cuisines of Mexico", which was her first best-selling book. Then "The Tortilla Book". Diana, if you'’ll set that down, right on the side, right in front of the camera here. And then the "Mexican Regional Cooking" book. And then she has a brand new one called "Nothing Fancy." Now, this lady has an ecologically, almost self-sufficient home. Where in Mexico? It'’s 100 miles west of Mexico City in the mountains of Michoacán. It'’s a beautiful place. I decided to have a little base in Mexico where I could have my books and my research. and that'’s how this place came about. With all my travels and learning, I wanted to concentrate them in one place. So that'’s why I bought some land and built an ecological house, which eventually would become my Mexican cooking center. The greenhouse is not ornamental. It'’s to take plants that I'’ve found on my trips. So more exotic things that I can'’t buy in the market and need for my regional recipes. So not only beautiful, but they're useful in traditional Mexican cooking. For many years, I have brought from Yucatán chile habanero. Now everybody says, "Oh, it'’s hot." Yes, but it has a flavor. It'’s one chile that has a flavor. This is a very unusual type of chile habanero. I just love it. It looks very beautiful. I said it'’s aubergine color. It'’s eggplant color, the color of eggplant. And this is chile dulce. And it'’s a surprise it'’s grown to that size. And I just have one. This is a plant I bought from Sierra de Puebla, where they cook it with black beans, Picolita. It'’s a coffee plant. Look at this lovely, shiny leaf, and it was obviously a seed that we threw away and just sprouted. This is my jewel box, right? I always say if robbers came in they'’d never know what, they wouldn'’t find money and jewels, but these are my jewels. So let me get my purse out here, out of the way. Okay. Oh, God! Jeez, I haven'’t got a lot of gas. [Sighing] [Car starting] I didn'’t have any goals. I sort of went where the wind blew me, out of curiosity, and just have to learn to do this. She would just go. She was traveling by herself usually. And she would sleep in her truck or sleep in a hammock that she took with her. She used to keep a tape recorder with her. Her early days, she would sometimes have a pistol with her. She put on thousands of miles, moving around Mexico and doing her research. I always came back laden with the local corn and the local chiles, mezcal, whatever I found along the way. She'’ll take a trip just to check one thing out. It took years. Every recipe has a frame. It has an ambience. Always mention who gave you the recipe. She approached Mexico in a very... genuine, giving, honest, hungry way. When Diana received the Order of the Aztec Eagle, I think that was the first time that Mexico really recognized her contributions. The more that time goes by, the more that her books will continue to be published and her recipes will be passed on. I think she will continue to have a very strong impact. She would say, "Well, I'’m done. That'’s it. That's it." But I still don'’t believe that. She says it now and I keep thinking, "Ah, there'’s something in there... "that she wants to say." My shoes are pretty awful. Calla lily. When this comes up in the rainy season and tall, the leaves can also be used. They are used in certain areas of Mexico, in southern Mexico, for tamales. I'’ve created this environment very much to preserve. I think it is terrible if children grow up in cities without trees, not hearing birds'’ songs, not appreciating the effort it takes to produce something pure to eat. It'’s so exciting to see every year is different, everything is different and you can eat it in different stages, too. And no fertilizer. All we do is compost everything in the house, and everything from the neighbors'’ houses, too. And then that goes on the ground and look at the result. It'’s quite stunning. See, you don'’t have to put chemicals on things. And, of course, to make my British marmalade, can'’t live without Seville orange marmalade, so that'’s in full swing. A mixture of things here as gardens should be. You never want mono culture. You want lots of different plants, so that... one plague or whatever it is will attack one plant, but not the others. So there we go. We'’ve got cilantro looking okay. Oh, don'’t have that over here. And we have onions, some scallions there, and lots of... We'’re waiting for the nopales to sprout. And this is tomato plant. This is one in flower because tomatoes are, generally, until the alum comes, are pretty awful. What are all these chefs and all these cooks doing not complaining about these awful tomatoes? Always looking for flavor. Food without flavor and without careful cooking, no matter how low-cal, can be horrible. There'’s a lot of horrible uncooked food these days. Let'’s learn to cook again. There'’s people who think microwaving is cooking. It'’s just heating food. Eating vegetables cooked in the microwave, to me, don'’t have any character. And I know I'’m gonna have lots of people writing in saying... [Grumbling] And you'’ve got to have opinions about cooking, too. I'’m noted for my opinions. But I always say if you'’ve arrived at this age and you haven'’t got opinions, I don'’t know how you'’ve been living. What? What is it about Mexican cooking? There is no high technique, except for making certain tamales. It'’s not like French cuisine where you could take four ingredients and make four different things. Okay? But it'’s knowing how to use, how to treat your ingredients, and how to use them, and the balance with ingredients. Who are professionals? I have three restaurants in Manhattan. Oh, my God. I wish you'’d tell me before. And you'’re a professional? Yeah, I have five restaurants in Portland. Oh, my God. These people! All right, now who else has cooked? I'’ve worked in a family catering company in Napa Valley in St. Helena. I'’ve only been cooking for three years. I'’m a novice. I think it'’s very nice that we have a mixed bag. As I say, you'’re never gonna forget this, if you survive. [Laughter] You never stir the rice. Okay? Never. It'’s absolutely sodden. It's absolutely sodden. No salt. There'’s no salt in it. No, dear, no, more than that. Oh, no. It just doesn'’t taste right. It'’s not at all good. I don'’t know. I should have seen the onion and garlic you put in. Sorry. No, it'’s not right. This is not how I would cook it, but you'll learn and you'’ll never forget. My golly, once you'’ve been here, you never forget. Okay, where are those damn chiles? It is absolutely appalling that Mexico is importing chiles. These are imported from Peru. Then there'’s some small red ones that are imported from China. None of these fine chefs give a shit and have said anything about it. Okay? None of them. Anyhow, okay... So, we'’ve got two things going here, and I'’m going to start the third. All right? Are you in for it? If I were religious, I'd make a little sign of the cross here. [Chuckling] But I'’m not religious... I trust in my gods of the trees and the birds and stuff like that. All right, everybody! Come closer, for God's sake. Okay? So was that in the oven overnight, Diana? Yep. With the rind with the fat. And that'’s going to be cut up into little bits. And that'’s the traditional way of doing it here. And there is not anywhere else. That will continue cooking a little bit more. It could be ready now, but we'’ve got stuff to do. Where are you all? Come on. I get bad tempered now. Look. I'’m trying to get you fed. We'’re just trying to keep up with you, Diana. [Laughter] Diana, how spicy are the cascabels? - Wait and see. - Okay. [Chuckling] We'’re getting '‘em on our hands, so we might need to know ahead of time. Go and wash your hands, right now! - I haven't touched them yet. - '‘Cause you know I'd forget. Okay, I haven'’t touched '‘em yet. You might forget and you go to the john or something, and, by golly, you will know! [Laughter] Who is going to look at Saveur Magazine ? I wrote 30 corrections to Saveur. And I said, here you're giving first place in the world to Mexican cuisine and all you can put on the cover is a dish of enchilladas? Here, here! Learn, learn, learn, learn! Read my books and learn, please. And what are you gonna do when I'’m gone? Who else is gonna start screaming? Nobody. [Loud applause] I live sustainably. And I just want to talk to people about sustainability. I am 90. So everybody gets very nervous, you see, that I'’m not gonna be around much longer, so they want to hear all my complaints and things while I'’m alive. I think it is so shocking that the more we are connected, electronically, the less we are unified. And that in a certain part of the world, these awful, goddamn machos come, you know like Putin and Trump and all the rest of it, and want to change it. They don'’t embrace and see the beauty of this world. We live in such a lavish world and our education is so poor. I mean, how many kids in school realize how many insects there are? I mean, millions and millions of different types, each playing their part in this marvelous universe. We'’re destroying our planet. We'’re destroying our environment and it'’s such a loss for the young people of today. You don'’t just use all the chemicals. You don'’t just use all your plastics. You don'’t just put in all your into your laundry, all the bleaches and all the fluffy stuff that'’s gonna make it fluffy. You remember that there are generations coming after you and you have a responsibility. Everything'’s going to a landfill. Do we really need to load up landfills, which will eventually filter into water for future generations? I don'’t think we do. Water is the gold of this planet. Nobody talks about the nitty gritties of every day of every person... How we can all make a difference? This is what it'’s all about. - Want to hold your medal up? - Wait a minute! - Yes. - Shoulders down, stomach in. I know I shouldn'’t be so vain at this age, but goddamn it, that'’s what keeps you going. I just start and do this, you know. They just got me under the wire. If I think had to wait another few years, I may not be here. But the thing is don'’t forget my words. All you chefs, if I come into your restaurant, I'’ll be looking in your garbage. Okay? I will just see how you run your kitchens. That'’s fantastic. - We'’re done. - Good. - You did amazing. - Oh, my God. You'’re a legend. I know, goddamn it. But I don'’t know how long I'’m gonna be a legend! [Laughter] Ooh, strawberries! It'’s like I get at home, you know? Well, life is not dull. It'’s hard, it's tough, a lot of disappointments. Oh, my God, I get so exhausted. And as I say, I tell everybody, I'’m looking for a long beach because I love to walk. But at the end, I want a three-star restaurant. I do not want to eat grilled fish and black beans every day. No. I hear you. You know? If you'’re relaxing you want, "Oh, come here, gorgeous." Yeah... It'’s probably really an annoying question, but I'’m so interested. If you could only have one more meal in your life... - Oh, yeah. That'’s such a bore. - Is it annoying? Such a boring question! If everyone was gonna die on Earth tomorrow... I would not think of eating. I won'’t tell you what I would do but I'’m not thinking of eating. - I like the answer! - Exactly, caleta. Everybody says, "Don'’t you think that love "starts in the kitchen over a meal?" I said, "No way." [Laughter] No way! Think of it, kids. Get with it, for God'’s sake! How romantic! I hope you like something Irish instead '‘cause I'’ve had too much wine to play Bach. [Violin solo, Irish melody] I have planned only five more years, and nobody can say no. There'’s a time. It'’s like the cauducidad... The date on your ingredients you buy. They last so long. Okay? And I choose to die when I want to die, when I have stopped feeling. If I were blind, or somebody said you have the wheelchair, I'’m out of it. Obviously, I have a choice, don'’t I? Everybody has a choice of suicide or whatever they want to do. Everybody has a choice. Nobody can tell you not to. God forbid that my friends will say, "Oh, it'’s Sunday afternoon and we have to go look at old Di." No... I myself... While I can'’t cook and I can'’t eat and I can'’t see and I can'’t walk, long before that, I'’m going. I haven'’t decided how but... Of course. I think I'’ll put the radio on. Let'’s have a look at the radio. [Radio] You'’re listening to 897, WGBH News... Oh, this is the wildest month. ...More great stories and more great... [groans] So pitch in at WGBH News-dot-org. ...McMaster faces essentially the same task as 26 years ago. How to make it rock. This time he must try to do so from within the White House as one of several top aides. In fact, Trump is already... This is not wasting paper, right? This is for scrap paper. [Chuckling] - Can I talk? - Sure. [Choking sound] [Chuckles] Too much to do. Look at all this stuff. Sixty years of stuff. [Theme music comes up] What am I gonna do? I just don'’t want it to be destroyed. I don'’t want people to come in and choose and take little things. It reveals what I have learned in Mexico, and what I love about Mexico, an appreciation of one little pot there that came from a certain village and I remember what I ate there and I'’ve written about it... You see? Hola, Chima. Hola, boy. He'’s such a cute dog. [Whispering] Chima, hi. [Whispering] Good boy. You'’re my boy. You my boy? Ya-ya-ya. Look at his coloring. Interesting, isn'’t it? To me this is a poem. It'’s a poem, making things grow in rocks. And then my chickens, all upstairs... Oh, they brought them upstairs to their house. I'’ve been very quixotic in my life, and many things I regret, yes. I could have been a lot more productive had I not go wandering off, time after time, all these villages. No, I have to go again next year. I have to go again in 6 months. I'’ve got to see what'’s happening. I think I'’d like to make a pact with the devil and take a few years off '‘cause I would like to retrace all my steps, all my steps through this country. [Theme music comes up] She told me it was like an Indiana Jones afoot trying to search for that precious gem, the diamond that is somewhere in the forest or in the mountains of Mexico. And she will not stop until she will find it. In order to have a future, we really need to understand our past and, more important, we need to protect our past. That'’s gonna be the legacy of Diana. Thing is, I'’m glad you're there because bicycles come along - and you know. - Yes. Let'’s go, let's go, let'’s go. - Let'’s go, let's go, let'’s go. - Yeah. - Would you like a coffee? - No, dear. Thank you. - Would you like some tea? - No. Chamomile or a little Tezon? Nobody knows how... No! You never make tea for an English woman. - I know. - Ever! I know. I just wanted to ask if you like a mint or digestive... You might boil your herbal tea, but you don'’t make tea for an English woman. The thing with Diana is you can'’t make tea. You can'’t make anything that English are experts in, but you can'’t make anything that Mexicans are experts in either. So how is it gonna go, just so Diana has it clear... 'Cause I think we have to go soon and there'’s a photographer that needs to take your picture. Oh, my God! Warn him, Amy. It'’s fine. I think he's seen worse than you. Don'’t worry. '‘Cause he'’s the one who will have to bear with you. [Diana speaking Spanish] I think he speaks English. [Diana continues speaking Spanish] - He speaks English. - No comprende... Oh, you don'’t? Oh well. I was telling I'’m not photogenic. I'’m not photogenic. And I'’m very old. So I'’m not a great subject. I haven'’t had a decent haircut and... You look just fine. I promise you. ...I live in the country and I wasn'’t... My hairdresser wasn'’t there when I was ready to... have my hair done. Hold my purse. Who'’s this? This is Dan Barber. - It's Dan Barber? - Over at the Blue Note. I didn'’t recognize him. Well, he had hair. He had hair when I saw him. Now don'’t make me look so severe, okay? Okay. - Because I'’m... - Because you'’re not? - No. - Pfft... [Chuckling] Okey-dokey. Thank God my black panties don'’t show. - Okay. - Cool. You all right? Cool? Oh will you all of you get together and not say "cool." - Find another adjective! - It'’s a good word! No, it isn'’t. Find another adjective! The English language is full of the most wonderful adjectives and none of you guys use it. So let'’s get the other hand. Yeah, that'’s wonderful. Yeah. Wonderful? Come on now. [Laughter] Diana, you'’re a feisty one, huh? Are you kidding? You don'’t think I've created something that nobody else has created and done the best Mexican cookbooks, 7 or 8 of them? - Can I...? - Cooked my way through the... all my 80, 90 years of life? Really awesome. [Chuckling] There you go. There you go. Can you back up a little bit? Diana, act like you like her, will you? Just for the photo. Wow! [Chuckling] And Gabriela, right here, both of you. All right, girls, thank you so much. Not "girls"! You don'’t say "girls". - We are ladies! - Ladies. We'’re ladies. Ladies, please. - Ladies, for God'’s sake. - Open your eyes. Yeah, I know. Are you ready to go onstage? Yes, I'’ll need my purse, though. - You need your purse onstage? - Yes, of course. - Or could we leave it here? - No. I want my purse, sweetie. I'’m gonna bring the purse on stage. ...It's got my credit cards... Don'’t be too bad. Gotta make it interesting, for God'’s sake. I know. Jeez. - Am I allowed to swear? - Yes. Good. Diane Kennedy is here. [Loud applause] You have to put it in context. I'’m old, okay? And certainly, I'’m not very sociable. Um... [Laughing] Don'’t ask me to play bridge, for God's sake. Um, and... [Chuckling] I'’m not always patient, no. I'’m very inpatient actually normally. But there are some things that you get so deeply into. One of the important things of Mexican food is the preparation of the ingredients. Once you'’ve got decent ingredients, How do you prepare them? And this matters. And you'’re not going to... toast your garlic in your guacamole, ok? You'’re not gonna put garlic in your guacamole, please. You'’re not gonna do certain things, certain things I'’ve learned in different parts of the country. And I think it'’s the building up of flavors and the final dish where you can taste these layers of flavors. That fascinates me because I love to eat. [Crowd murmuring] Good. Good. Well, don'’t forget, don'’t boil, simmer. [Theme music comes up] Your work life is not considered love. It'’s a passion out of curiosity and energy and things like that. It'’s not just rushing in and getting a recipe and coming out. It'’s recreating it in your own kitchen. How do you express this recipe so that people can do it... So that it won'’t be lost? God knows I tried. And the only way that I was capable of were the things that were given to me and the character I was given. I tried. You can'’t win '‘em all. And how horrible it is for people to go around wanting to be loved and liked. You just go on doing what you know you want to do, and at some point, the tide will turn and you'’ll make your mark, or you may not. I'’m very honored the way so many people do look at my books and appreciate what I'’ve done. That'’s all you can do, and cook from them. That'’s all you can ask for. There'’s this little piece by Tagor in an English poem and it said, "Let me light my lamp," said the star, "and never debate whether it will remove the darkness." Why did you call the book "Nothing Fancy"? It'’s down to earth cooking through different phases of my life. But there is extremely fancy stuff in that, too, because I love to eat and I love to cook. And before I die, if I can'’t eat... Okay, when I can'’t eat, wow! Yeah. You'’ve got to have delicious food. [music plays]
