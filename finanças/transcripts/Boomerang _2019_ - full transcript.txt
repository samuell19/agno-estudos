So what, if you're a Social worker who is serving you at home? You must have help for that, right? Don't think I'll let this go, if you attack on personal matters. Ours is this thick skin of NGO, ego is pointless, and we fear no one. Then, we'll have to take action on a different level. What will you do? Will you publish it in THE HINDU? Please go ahead. Sir, I think you're unaware according to Right to Information Act. If we file a petition at Governors office, he has to answer. What action have you taken pertaining to this boy's case? Have you sent an email or a fax? If you don't give an explanation on why you haven't found anything we can take legal action against you. Do whatever you can it's a country with a population of 100 crores. Where will I look? Shall we try magic? Ah!? If I come to know about anything, will call you. You can leave now. In order to save a life, I didn't think twice I put my signature on that register. Doctor had mentioned about your accident. In a Govt. Hospital's mortuary better than getting cremated as an orphan thought it will be beneficial to you. I pretended to be his mother. thought about it and signed once again. Why? What happened? Mistaking me for him--- ---they're trying to kill me. Looking at all of it, I don't think it was an accident but a murder. Murder uh!? I was just thinking of giving you a face--- but that face will bring you so many issues never expected it. I'm--- ---what do you want me to do? Look here, it's not your fault If you come to know anything about it, you have my phone number please keep me informed. Definitely, Sure! I don't know what to say...! Please be careful. -Tell me Mom -Shiva...! It's really late, why haven't you come home yet? I'm coming home do you want Dosa or Chapathi for dinner? I'll come and tell you. I--- Hello! Shiva!? How long will it take for you to get home? I'll let you know, Mom. These days even to buy a helmet they do extreme research but you're struggling here with a stranger's face. You could've rather remained with your burnt face. Don't know who is he? No idea, why they're chasing me. I'm worried about Mom and Sister. I'm not returning home, until this is sorted. Hey...! You're here now--- ---what if they assume this is your house and kill me? You're selfish--- ---you want your family safe, but doesn't matter if I get lynched. Hey don't drink, you're going to get a headache not sure I'm going to have my head anymore. Headache it seems. -Ey! -Ah! When we were at IOC--- ---there was a girl who recognized me Ya the voluptuous one. Ya the voluptuous one. If we ask her, she might know something about him. That's a great idea. -What are you eating? -Bubble Gum! Here! Ey! Let that go When was the last time you met him? The other day in the elevator. Before that!? This you can ask him yourself. Few chapters are lost at the moment. He lost his memory due to a head injury from an accident. Oh my God! He has written your last meet on is thigh to remember. Do you want to see it? No, no, no, no! It's just on the thigh I actually met him once--- ---on a train from Trichy to Chennai. While I was talking to him he mentioned his name as Shakthi and his hometown is near Trichy. I don't know anything else about him. Actually this is enough I'll use this information to jog his memory. Thanks a lot. Ok, bye. Thank you. -Hello! -Ma, this is Shiva speaking Hey Shiva! why didn't you come home last night? where were you? Mom, you first listen to me and stop asking questions. I'm heading to Trichy for an emergency pertaining to work You send across my clothes and medical reports through Geetha. I'll return and explain everything. For what!? Mom, please listen to what I have to say. I'll explain it later. -Bye! -Shiva! Hey you! Shiva inside of Shakti! We just have a name--- ---with just that how do expect us to find someone in a big city like Trichy. Are you going to sing a family song? Even if you do, no idea if there's a family song. Get inside... Ya...Ya, 24! Ya...Ya, 24! -Hey! -Ah... We didn't have anything--- ---at least we his name and the city he lived in. ---at least we his name and the city he lived in. When we get down in that city someone who knows Shakthi will come and speak to us. It's fine, if they just come and talk just like how Vijay gets shot in "Kaththi" movie what if you get shot like that? You're right people came Chennai to kill me don't you think, he'll send someone to Trichy? We'll catch hold of one from them, and say that I'm not the one they're looking for. face transplant, accident we'll make them understand. Our issue will be resolved. You're being too ambitious. I'm not taking this risk Train is running at full speed. -Jump off it -Ey...! Fine, either ways I'm going to be killed. Hey, who are you? Girls are around, don't you feel ashamed being half naked? Where are you headed? I'm heading to write NEET exam. Then he's dressed right. Then he's dressed right. Hey, then why are you just wearing shorts? They'll strip him off it, once he's reaches there. -Where are you going to write? -Trivandrum! Why, isn't there a place in our state? There's no vacancy in Tamilnadu. They have vacant places to open liquor shops, but there's no place to write exams. Hello, this time I'll definitely clear the exam. All the best! Hey Shiva! what a surprise. -Hey, Hi. -Hi! I've been trying to contact you for a week It kept saying not reachable You know what, our short film has reached 7 million views. That's great, congratulations! "Athadi Enna Udambi" [Trending Tamil Song] "Anga Anga Pachai Nirmabi" [Trending Tamil Song] Even this song has reached 10 million views. So what!? I've got a chance to direct a film. -Oh! -You please sit down. Greetings one and all! -Greetings brother! -Ya, Hello! Do you know who is he? Are you this Train's engine mechanic? Sir is our producer. He's from Thuraiooru. We're heading there for location hunt. That's right! Sir, this is Shiva. Sir, this is Shiva. Glad to meet you--- He's the one, who changed the course of my life. It's 'cause of him, I'm a director now. I agreed to produce, 'cause the Hero referred her. But she's been ranting about Linear - Nonlinear I don't understand anything. I'm worried if I can make profit. Revolutionary Leader MGR's movie "Anbe Vaa", I've seen it 50 times. I can narrate that story in my sleep. This is his problem he's still stuck in 1970's Cinema has advanced a lot since then Sir, please mix with the trend I'll come Showcase your trend in the Climax I suggested. Brother, you tell me one thing how should be a climax? A Hero should fight leaping like a tiger, and kill the villain. That's when audience will applaud. Isn't that the successful formula? Only then, we can make money. You're speaking like an "M" -Ey...! -I meant you're Magnificent Exactly...! Sir, no matter how strong you're you can't kill someone with your bare hands. What are the chances? Shiva, but I've read in a novel this is my film's climax. If Epidefrine is induced into someone's body in abundance will die of excess adrenaline. Not only that, traces of it won't be captured in Post-Mortem report. It's available at the Hospital to keep the patients stable. And if adrenaline is injected in excess, they'll definitely die. 100% I might die too. These things should be cinematic Sir you can decide after watching the entire film. I don't I'll be in a state to talk after watching the film. She gets easily angry what can I do here? Hey! you mentioned about explaining things to the people who are chasing do you think, they'll understand Face Transplant? Let's check with this B & C audience -Sir! -Huh!? I have this friend he used to look exactly like you, ugly--- -is it so? -Ya! 6 moths ago in a fire accident his face got fully burnt Oh no! So they did Face Transplant, what did you say? Face Transport uh!? It's not transport, it's face transplant. His face was changed with a surgery, now he looks exactly like Ultimate Star Ajith. -Ey...! -Ah... Are you blind? Have you not seen Thala Ajith before? -Brother -Ah... Do you peck me for a crack head on this train? -Idiot! -Ah! You seem to be a genius are you aware of short term memory loss? Yes I do. How do you know that? Wasn't that explained in the movie Ghajini. But there's no move pertaining to this then how do you expect me to believe this? That's right, you're great. Even if we look for the ones who are chasing us, I doubt they'll understand what we have to say. What happened? Nothing! Just like that. The thing I asked on the day I won the competition, was inquiring about that. I should get the feeling of living with you for a century I need to have that trust When I look at your face, that trust--- ---isn't evident. I might marry you but when we go out in the public and when the people look at us The boy is handsome but the girl is not that good looking. I'll feel bad about it. So, let's not. It's for your own good. I'm not angry for what you've said. I said the exact thing to one person. Now I get it, how hurt he would've been. I'll definitely apologize to him, If I meet him someday. If so, you'll have to apologize to me. That's me. His name is Shakthi. They've been chasing me thinking I'm Shiva. I'm heading for Trichy to find out who is he. Doctored Kiss, is it? Hey! Just hold on for a minute, I'll return him. Buddy do you even realize why are we here? I'm not able to sleep. I'm pissing in fear, that someone might hack me into pieces. I'm not even related to this issue. But you--- ---are hugging a girl here. Where's your friend? You don't even have time for that [VENDORS CLAMORING] Put purpose of visit as "Searching for a Face" the car will be here in an hour, we can use that for recce. Buddy, you and Gigi take this room She and I will take the room opposite to it. Are we here for honeymoon? She seems to be fine with it, what's your problem? Hey, the RTO and Aadhar offices in this city we'll show that picture and check if some knows about him. I'm planning to go to crowded places. Let's see if someone recognizes me. Be careful, hope he's not under heavy debts they might beat you up thinking it's him. [VENDORS CLAMORING] [VENDORS CLAMORING] -Hi -Hi -Hi -Hi Did you get any clue? Shiva, I have an idea. They're chasing you 'cause of this face better tell everyone, this is not your face you met with an accident, did a face transplant explain everything in detail through a video. upload it on Facebook and Twitter. The chances of people who are chasing to see that are high Hey, that's a great idea. As it is I'm under unnecessary issues. I don't want another problem. If an issue arises, we'll say it wasn't me but Admin. That's the fashion these days. These days lame things are trending even your short film was trending right!? Hey! I was just stating an example. Fine, you tell me. I'll record. Hey...! Hey! -Buddy...! -Shiva! Who are they!? Hey! Be careful Hey...hey, come on move. Give me the car keys. Sir! don't close your eyes, look at me. Look at me, Sir. Sir! Grandma, listen to me. My grand daughter thinks I'm not well. It's nothing, just show me your hand. It's just fever, you will be fine with an injection. -Ok!? -Ok, Doctor. -Ok!? -Ok, Doctor. Please get this injection. Hey, he's right there. Ey! Shiva what happened? I have no idea, he was walking on the road. I didn't see--- ---another problem to add on. Is he alive or dead? Not sure. What happened Doctor? Sister ask Dr.Lakshmi to get to OT right away. Ok Doctor. It's a head injury and mild concussion anything could be told, only after 24 hrs of observation. I think you'll have to wait. Shakthi! AGRO TECH! This is our team's 9 months project. If you see the end users here, are the farmers in Netherlands And the key features of Agro Tech are Smart Irrigation methods, with minimum usage of ground water. alert messages with weather predictions. video tutorials by experts for effective crop management. Did you understand anything of it? Did you understand anything? You're pretending to be a first bencher Baldy, just kidding -you continue -Maya! Umm...by customizing basic Google maps, we've created a Hydro-Geological map through this the farmer with their registered lands, can check the ground water availability. Using our App, the products farmers manufacture, can fix a price of their own for instance how a middle man makes money in our country that won't happen here with this App. Not only that when the agricultural business is giving them profits they won't tend to take a loan. As there's no loan taken, there will be no suicides. That's all you honor. Yes, our 9 months of handwork will decide a Nation's agriculture. Thank you! Great job Shakthi! I did it too great job to you also. she was a part of it too. great job to you as well. Wait outside for couple of minutes, we'll get back to you. -Parthiv Hi Chandru, how's it going?

You appreciated during presentation, not even a prior notice given What's unfair? Including you, we're terminating 100 people today.

I'm scared thinking about the payment due next month Hey, I'm due 95,000 on my credit card everyone has issues. My friend is working as a Team Leader at Hexagon shall I approach him for the job? Not required How long are we going to be enslaved to these foreign companies? Were we born to do this? What else can we do? We're not in this IT job accidentally What else do we know other than coding? Is that all we know? Think hard Hey, we're not in a situation to think they've fired us we have worked for a year in that Agro Tech project I can only think of Netherlands agriculture, even in my sleep we have this knowledge right? About Netherlands agriculture? Why are we still stuck up on Netherlands? We'll think of aspects to improve agriculture on our lands. What are you saying? I have 5 acres of land in my village, I've decided I'm going to do agriculture We'll start it now, Maya Just by inking your fingers once in 5 years, won't bring a change. We'll have to get down in the arena and work for it. You're right, and it's good to hear instead of working without a clue for a foreign land we can be rightful owners to our own land. How long will you be hogging the pump I have a infant waiting at home I just need two pots of water let me take it, let me Hey...Panchali get that pot here get that pot here damn it. Be careful, don't spill it. Here, take this too.

How are you!? So you're the fat brother from village you're chubby and cute. Shakthi dear--- ---fat boy Are you fine Son? Mom, these are my friends -Come in Son. -Hello Aunty. We both started the job together and have been fired together as well. Oh no, even you got fired? That's right. Mom, did you tell Dad? I'm scared to tell him. You tell him yourself when he's in a good mood. If I say anything he'll shout at me. Son, how many days are you on leave this time? Dad, about that--- ---at least this time try staying for long. Not just few days Uncle, we're going to stay here for good. Just show tell me which is my room--- This is my friend Shanmugam. -Hello uncle. -This is Shakthi's brother Dong Lee. Hi! Hi! We're not leave, but have quit our jobs. They didn't quit, they got fired. -Fatso, take this inside. -Let that go. It's become routine with the IT companies 650 were sacked in Verizon you have a 3 years experience you can find a job elsewhere. I'm not going to look for a job, Dad. I'm going to do agriculture have you gone nuts? I worked hard for your studies, and you want to return to sludge this is just not sludge but a tunnel When I was working in IT, I found out suitable methods for irrigation with extensive research and have developed an App. Instead of doing that for a foreign country, why shouldn't I do it for our village? Basically agriculture is the back bone of India. 70% of the population is involved in agriculture. You've read about Verizon, You've read about Verizon, but unaware of this. I'm disappointed. Ey...you guys have gone crazy. We need water for agriculture. Which isn't available, that's why I've sold my land and planning to settle in Chennai. Who said there's water available in Chennai? -Eh!? -Useless buggers Councilor has mentioned that our land will fetch us good price he has given 1 lac as advance yesterday. Start looking for a job in another company, Brother get me my bag, -Stay back son, -I don't want a room We'll go elsewhere and do agriculture We'll go elsewhere and do agriculture At least give me that coffee. Is this the Councilor's house? Damn, it's so huge Even Pondicherry CM's house won't be this big. I think he must've been to Kovathur as well. Get inside stuff yourself with meat balls and inquire about the place Ah..tell me brother. Hello Sir! Come in, brother. Did Dad send you? I just had a word with the astrologer for a good date to register. I just had a word with the astrologer for a good date to register. Day after is Ashtami and Navami so he suggested to do it tomorrow. Ah Sir...I'm here to talk to you about it. As of now, we don't have the idea of selling the land. that's why I came down to return the advance and inform not to register. Brother--- ---your land is going to be used in a huge project. So--- ---the payment will be a big one. Ah...no Sir. We don't wish to sell it at the moment. We've changed our minds. Get those tablets for Blood pressure damn it. Get lost! Are you trying to threaten me with this person and hike the price? It's not like that Sir have a good look at me Do you seriously feel threatened? Days are gone for a villain to look dreadful wearing glasses and doing villainous stuff is the trend now Damn funny, Sir. I'm damn serious about it. Your father is, Head of the Village. if he returns the money, he'll set a bad example then everyone in the village will start to do the same. What can we do about it? We don't wish to sell it now. Just take back your advance. What the hell are you going to do with that land? That we'll take care of it. Sir! Thank you Sir! Sir I have a doubt are those award given to you for good work done? Get lost! Look here Shakthi just 'cause you're my son we can't decide anything in haste village people's decision will be the final verdict of Panchayat. Right, that will be fair. What is it now? Listen--- for past 2-3 generations agriculture is missing from our village agriculture which is depleting at present we have to give a life to it Has he gone crazy!? There's no water to use in toilets and he's talking about agriculture Just 'cause we don't believe in doing it, our village is in this state. So water is the issue here? The Kalyani river is gone dry for years we don't have water even for basic needs But the Poongoodi river 20kms off the village, during heavy rains the excess water overflows without being used My plan is to divert that water towards our village. I don't think their idea will be a practical one. You don't think so right? How will you? In the last 25 years, has anyone earned profits doing agriculture? Have you bought a house? May be have sold your house instead At the same time, a Real Estate owner sand contractor and Bar owner has been making profits But farmers have been committing suicides Person who have swindled in crores evades to a foreign country But a loan of 6000 taken for a pump set, will be beaten up by Police. It's not that we can't change this but if they change, where else they will swindle from They will go to an extent, letting the corporate get into agriculture 'Cause he funds the expenses for Elections. They won't think of changing anything but we can change if we decide to. that's what our plan is all about. We'll give you a presentation now This is Poongoodi river after enough usage of that village the rest of the water just flows in vain into the sea. In the path of that river--- ---that is, if we dig a channel for 20 kms the water from that river is linked to our village Kalyani river the pond and wells will be filled and we can use that water for our village's agriculture. post which excess water will flow into the sea through Kalyani River. There are 134 crores consumers in our country In spite of it, one business which runs on loss is Agriculture. Everywhere there's a scarcity of water to overcome the scarcity, first we should start linking rivers in India. This is our plan. If we achieve this our village agriculture won't be dependent on rains. It will rather be dependent on our hard work and the water which will run along the year. This scheme seems to be a good one. If we ask our MLA, he'll do it himself. As if he'll be willing to. It's been 50 years, your MLA and others who we elected could've resolved the cauvery issue Your MLA, do you know what his business? He contracts Sand. If our rivers start flowing, and if we start irrigation, how will he get to sell sand? Hey...! If you trust these youngsters--- ---they'll get you stranded with nothing. They're a generation of live-in relationships. If you listen to their ideas and follow them--- ---you'll regret forever. Instead sell it all to me and be happy with the money it will fetch you guys. Oh God! Son, it was 40 years ago that's how I saw our village from your eyes. Before I die, please change the fate of this village. Take this--- ---this is what I can offer My dear! It's a good project it's a good thing that youngsters like you coming forward for agriculture. Thank you so much Sir. You're the first person, who has spoken with hope. Whoever we went to, instead of checking what the project is about they're keen on how to reject the proposal. It's useless in trying to change them. It's useless in trying to change them. But you three, don't let your confidence down. Just make sure to check, what exactly they need. What else, they're expecting money but they're not asking for it. They won't ask you It's you, who has got the need you will have to find out from them, what they actually expect. Then why the hell--- -Ey...! -are they getting paid? Listen--- ---I don't belong to that category Look here--- Tamilnadu Water and Drainage TWAD If they give an approval I can help as much as I can within my limits. Thanks Sir. Listen, I've done as much as I can this is such an old bike be thankful it's running. Old really...! A 60 year old can get married--- ---but shouldn't wish to have a child. Since the inception of Aadhar card, not just the age, even the personal matters are public -Sir -sir! -who's that? -My name is Shakthi I came to you regarding a petition you guys use to come to office and trouble now you're here too We were told you're never in the office, who said that? I meant you will be busy at the office, if we meet you outside, we can have a better conversation. What's the issue? Linking the rivers in Poongoodi village, It's us who are seeking it. Do you think linking rivers is a Childs play? Don't be kidding. Sir, I don't understand, I don't see it that how this is funny If the next generation is going to die due to scarcity we will be stained with that sin. In order to stop such mishap we're struggling here. -What is this? -Car! -Is it new? -No it's old Was it on EMI or paid in full? EMI! Oh-Oh! Sir, if you give us that NOC, we can start our work We don't buy things on EMI, as we're Govt. servants, the payments reach home Why would you take that effort. You will ignore even if someone commits a suicide due to loans what's the mileage? Sir, you're not listening to what I'm saying what happened to that NOC? Listen, what you're seeking is not a small thing, there are many formalities Please understand. Is the bike ready? That officer had mentioned, they won't ask for it directly. You did see what he was expecting ♪ Make a living working hard ♪ don't live on hard workers. Is this is a joke? Sir, this is not a joke 10 TMC of water from Poongoodi river mixing into the sea, if that is diverted to Kalyani river. 1000 families will make a living doing agriculture why are you so concerned about their lives Why are we officers and politician here for? The entire village knows why you haven't done it. We don't want to waste our time on that We will work for our needs Ya right You guys are fooling yourselves with digging tunnels and channels also dragging the village down with it. We're not the ones who are dragging them down we're not politicians to do that. Our village requires water for irrigation we can make that happen ourselves please help us with it. Agriculture, Cows and Dung--- ---it's disgusting to ears. I hail from a farmer's family these are useless sentiments and is a waste of time. My grandmother took a promise from me, asked me never to comeback to agriculture 'cause I'll be destroyed If someone talks ill about agriculture punch them on their face. That's the promise my grandmother took from me. Isn't this pissing you off? Hey, shut up. Ey...we're here to seek permission--- ---and he's talking about his dead grandmother. Sir, please Sir. When someone is dying of hunger, it's a torture to their sight when you throw away the food. For God sake don't do that. 1000 families can make a living. And we're ready to invest our money and work for it. Can you just grant us permission to do it. no matter what you say, I can't permit public to work on their own If you want, file a petition if everything is right, Govt. will act on it. There's a procedure for everything. Are you really following the procedure? And giving a permit to the bars at wine shop. You've permitted it, taking bribes. We're trying something good here, and you demand bribe don't call yourself an officer. Mind your words I'm talking to you damn it, and it's the truth Sir, can you or not? Just tell us that don't talk nonsense. Didn't I ask you to file a petition. We'll take care of it. Sure will take care of it. -Sure! -Sure! This won't work out They don't seem like rules they're mongrels in the name of officers Salary and Bonus, if they don't get it, they go on a strike on top of it they need bribe Damn it! Losing is not something new to our village that doesn't mean we accept defeat and lose hope. Hey...why are you getting angry at me? They won't permit, even after they're dead. We will get it, I will make it happen. Hey, come here. -Us? -Yes you guys, come here. It's them Sir. Hey, Rajan. -Do you know one thing -Sir! These guys were working in a IT company at Chennai They were fired from that job. while they were wondering what to do for living? they thought of these foolish village people. This agriculture, water, protests, hay etc--- ---got he public confused then swindle their funds and evade to foreign countries like America and Australia. Isn't this your perfect plan? Buddy do you know one thing Poongoodi water service Sir owns it there are 62 water tankers if the village gets access to good water Sir's water can business will go down the drain. Isn't this your perfect plan, Sir? 62 trucks is it? You're an inspector, right? You must earn around 50-60k? Even we get paid the same in IT companies No matter how much we slog--- ---we have multiple EMI's taken from our accounts how is that you have 62 trucks running? How many families you must've destroyed. Ey...how dare you! Sir, Sir...don't hit me. Sir don't Damn you! Ey...Sir! Sir, don't hit me Ey...don't hit me Trying to be smart with cops? Sir don't, please listen to me hey...hey let me go. hey...hey let me go. Sir, they're young boys...please don't -I know them personally -Arrogance! -I know them personally -Arrogance! don't you dare again Sir, they're good guys What are you staring at? Now shoot! Can you manage to shoot at least 6 people? But the 7th one will burn you to ashes right here right now. I thank each and everyone, who are here to fight for their lives we tried every possible venue we've tried knocking on every door No door was open to us not even one soul respected us This protest is to make their heads turn. To grab the attention of Govt. and Govt. officers why should we burn ourselves alive How many more lives are we going to lose? We shouldn't lose anymore lives. Why did we elect them? Is it just to link the Aadhar card number to our mobile? We're not asking too much just to divert the excess water towards the village, we'll use it. Our farmers were in Delhi for 45 days--- without any food or water who cared about it? Their demands are still not met but they're ignorant about these things even without doing anything they fancy us with a 1000 or 2000 rupees during elections We fake a smile a and cast our votes It's in our hands, for not to repeat this. Just 'cause the village is in distress instead of depending on the men in our families each and every women of our village are here with their infants sitting under scorching sun. This is our first victory. Video of a girl winking gets a million hits in 10 minutes--- ---but when the agriculture is in despair no one seemed to bother. Agriculture is the back bone of our nation--- ---but that back bone has worn out pleading to each and everyone All the rivers in India were about to get linked for agriculture, it's taking forever and they've killed the notion. This protest is to let us link two rivers between the villages. This is just the beginning -Shall we protest!? -We will protest! -Shall we protest!? -We will protest! Greetings to one and all. Don't worry, I'm here for your troubles. Hello brother, give me that. Brother, this protest of yours--- ---should be a victorious one, my hearty wishes for that. Starting today, it's not just your protest your protest--- ---will have full support of "KAKA-COCO" party. Sir, thanks for coming but this is a protest of our lives don't turn this into a political motive. Brother, it's a very powerful party, Think about it. You can leave Sir. I said it's a powerful party. Get lost from here. Crowd!? Bravery amidst the crowd? It's an useless gathering of the crowd. Hey, Collector--- ---get the hell out here brother please sit down Brother, you be quiet. I'll take care of it. Come out damn it. Brother please listen, sit down. Hey Police get lost from here Brother...brother get lost from here. Sir, he didn't mean to do that Sir don't hit us Hey, how are you lay hands on me Sir, don't hit us -Ey! -Enough Sir Hey....Hey! -Get lost! -Oh no! Oh no! Oh no, let go. Sir, don't hit me. Sir--- ---Sir! Sir, there are kids Please don't hit us Stop it Idiots, stop it Stop it! Don't hit the public. Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop damn it! Mr.Shakthi, what you're doing here is public nuisance. First get that straight. Facebook protestors like you--- ---you're not aware of practical difficulties. This has become a fashion now. Huge gathering of public won't fetch you any solution. Sir, don't take me wrong we're not protesting to while away time We've done agriculture for generations we lived our lives sowing seeds if you ask them to look for another job How is that possible? If he protests against it, you call them public nuisance It's you people, who has brought them on streets there wasn't any issue until it was a public protest violence was infused into it. It all started when a lot entered for their filthy gain. If you can, why don't you arrest them Before they infiltrate, speak to us Just with spades and crowbars we can't link rivers. We have to discuss to reach a solution. Stale discussions like this has taken 50 years to even shut down a Decree. This project, without the support of the Govt.--- without a ground plan we can't just proceed with manpower. Sir, was the big Temple of Thanjavur was built with latest technology? foreigners are going crazy over it thinking how the 80 tonne stone was taken all the way on top of the tower.

I swear, you both are being offered $500,000 as salary. What about Maya!? Even Maya is being offered the same package. -What about her grandmother? -what!? What!? Sorry it was a cross talk. Shakti wants to say something. Thanks for firing us from that job. We're doing exactly what we love at the moment. We're happy and Chandru one more thing. Ya tell me Do you have time? Ok, go ahead You're working 8 days a week--- ---and you get drunk on Saturday nights Then one day, just like us you'll be sacked too So, I have a better deal for you you can come to my village. There are 8 cows we don't have someone to throw out the dung If you come, I'll pay you a wage of 80 rupees/day. Bloody dog, hung up. Son, where were you all these days? I thought you were out of town you thought I was just the man of word I will be with you guys until my last breath appreciate that Son. After everything is done, there will be a inscription right!? Make sure my name is there, history is important. Hey, just send a email to Prithvi. To transfer the funds. -Fine -attach all the documents I'll take care of things here Ok, fine. Brother! It's a landslide! everyone run. It's a landslide! start running. RUN! It's a landslide!Keep running! Come on everyone keep running. Sister come on. -Run! -Come on Everyone keep running, I'll come behind -Come soon -I'll come, you leave everyone run...! -Keep running -run faster -Run faster -lift them up Check if we left anyone behind come on keep running Come on keep running, come on Come on run, landslide is happening Keep running! Keep coming--- ---come on run brother keep running. Come on run faster Oh my god, my brother Oh no! he died at young age Oh my God! What will I do now? Who will take care of your family? Shanmugam! you're my dearest Shanmugam! Is there no one to help us. Shanmugam! Shanmugam! Wake up, damn it. Shanmugam! Shanmugam! Shanmugam! Shanmugam! Oh no! Please comeback to life Shakthi! Everything got buried into sand Shakthi look at this mess Shakthi look what has happened to everyone Son--- Ey...look Shakthi is here Oh God! Shakthi look at him--- Ey...! Ey...Shanmugam! Ey! Look at this mess--- he has left us behind Oh no! Brother...! OH NO...! 21 died in that landslide. Shakthi felt guilty that it was all his fault. That was the last time I saw Shakthi I looked for him everywhere. No clue on the complaint registered with Police. But if his face was donated to you--- ---then Shakthi must've met with an accident. What happened with Shakthi wasn't an accident. It was murder. They're under the impression that I'm Shakthi, and are behind me. I even inquired the person who signed for my surgery even she is not aware of him. Maya! From what you're saying--- ---I suspect that Councilor must be behind it Not him--- ---he was killed in a party scuffle. He was angry with us but not to the level of killing Shakthi. Maya, if you don't mind--- can I see the details on the river inter-linking project? This is Shakthi's laptop all details are stored in it but the password--- ---I don't know the password Shall I give it a try? Shiva! This has face recognition option Hey! I went through the details about the river linking project. Really amazing! In order to progress our nation's GDP all the rivers in India should be link and agriculture should develop. In order to help executing this project, from our US Tamil LLC I'm sending $50,000 Tiny contribution to our homeland. Look here, it's 10 TMC of water It's going vain into the sea. In order to get this into our village and develop agriculture, Shakthi is struggling for us. You people never liked the fact, if farmers are happy. No matter what happens, we will make sure to link this water to Kalyani river Share this as much as possible, so it will reach all the officials. Maya, isn't this your email-id? That's right, it's my id. But it's not delivered. He was trying to send an email on June 5th. due to wrong email address, it wasn't delivered. Open it. Maya! Maya! I'm not sure, I'll be alive tomorrow but you have to know the truth. Shakthi!? How come you're here? 21 people who died in that land slide they're stating you're the reason for it and there's an FIR against you. You better leave from here. Sir--- It was in Shanmugam's hand This wasn't a landslide. It was pre-planned set up Bomb! We shouldn't let this go. Let's go to the commissioner right away. Also will inform the media. moreover the people of our village Ok, don't panic this has to be handled in the right way First I have to inform the AC, wait for a minute, I'll get my phone Just a minute Hello! Sir good evening. Yes Sir, Shakthi is right here. Yes Sir, Shakthi is right here. He's a good person. It's not his fault. I'll bring him in 10 mins. Ok Sir! Ok Sir, thank you...thank you. I'll get ready wait for a moment. There is no agriculture here, Sir. It's an empty land. It will show clearly in your camera. The people of this village are fools. we can take it from them easily. But my commission is 5%. Do you understand, Sir? "If someone harms you" "Do good unto them" Ok!? Wow! Beautifully spoken, Thiruvalluar will be happy. We've taken a lot of money from you, shouldn't be asking this still can't help it you've extracted enough gas already what is left to extract now? We've contributed enough to the gas industry this is something else. "Private Electricity" You've taken care of electricity for long we'll share half the responsibility of your Govt. You've privatized buses Banks are privatized You didn't spare the Education system too You didn't spare the Education system too Only the water you've paid for is pure, water which is available for free, will cause disease you people privatized that as well. And when it came to telephones in the name of "Tels" you guys privatized that as well. Now you're turning electricity into private sector what's next!? Trains!? Oh! So that's in pipeline too We're investing 500 crores in this project and have decided to rake in profits up to 2000 crores, that's EDICOS's plan. The only goal of a businessman is--- ---Profits! So, there will be no empathy. When someone is not selfish, cares about everyone and when he gets down to help them. In the end he gets defeated by slimy dogs like you. You're right Shakthi how many can I keep killing in the name of money You didn't lose to me at the end it's me who has been giving you a run around. When this project begun, you came with the river linking plan convinced and confused the people with agriculture and lead them not to sell their lands. If we achieve this our village agriculture won't be dependent on rains. Through the same company which fired you I planned to send you America. We're hiring you guys back Thanks for firing us from that job. we love what we're doing at the moment. And that Councilor--- ---for making him win all the elections was useful to me for the first time. Instead sell it all to me and be happy with the money it will fetch you guys. Do you remember getting arrested for no reason? But still you managed to gather the public and protested also got permission from the Collector. -Shall we protest? -We will protest! -Shall we protest? -We will protest! So I sent two of my men into the crowd You got the permission from the collector You got the permission from the collector I was left with no choice I planned to use the same pit, you people dug as their graves. Man-made Landslide! For public it seemed like a natural Landslide. But it was my set up all along. This is still not the vital plan the reason for the death toll I wanted to frame you for that. But your friend sniffed out something before his death right!? Air and water, the gifts of nature. You guys have made it impossible to even enjoy them In the name of capitalism and survival of the fittest you just look after yourself. Just for your gain--- ---21 lives! There are many lives on this earth just like the worms. But when you build a factory or you're digging a hole, they tend to die. To me it was 21 worms which died. Now another worm is about to die. Hey! Do you peck yourself for a big revolutionary leader, what are you going to do now? Ey! Hey! Shakthi! Die damn it! Ah...Shit! Maya! I'm not sure if I'll be alive tomorrow But you need to know the truth about few things--- Hey Muruga, who is this? no idea, when did get on the truck? Fine, let's leave before someone sees us. Can you please open your eyes? What was our fault? Our village, and for our agriculture water...we were trying get water. a bomb was planted instead. 21 lives were buried alive and killed. On top of it, Shakthi too only people of this stature can survive? Sir...Sir! Sir! When I saw you panic in order to save me--- ---I understood that you're not him. -You...!? -Sir! -You!? -Don't close your eyes, look at me. look at me, Sir. look at me, Sir. Sir! I collected information pertaining to you Hereafter my men won't trouble you. Leave! Suraj is your name right!? If the power plant project for private electricity didn't take off--- ---you would've been on streets begging destroying the people of the village and their agriculture it's not necessary for you to make a living out of their misery. Hey! But for your gain, you've killed 22 people, without mercy how do you know so much? I thought you're not Shakthi. So what If I'm not Shakthi--- ---that doesn’t justify you're right. Police - 1 Lac PWD officer - 3 Lacs and Councilor - 10 Lacs Just for the sake of money they came behind you wagging their tail like dogs. But Shakthi--- ---don't know he was He gave me a new life with a new face What can I do for him? Shiva, I've read in a novel If Epidefrine is induced into someone's body in abundance will die of excess adrenaline. Are you struggling to breathe? I've increased the level of adrenaline in your body you're going to die of suffocation. It can't be traced even in post-mortem.
