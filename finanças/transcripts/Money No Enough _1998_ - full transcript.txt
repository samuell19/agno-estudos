This is totally no respect, huh? Well, it's a good thing. What do you mean? This matter concerns our country. Hey, hello. I'm very disappointed with your attitude. An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. They burn our flag, we burn their flag! Let's do it. To show that Singaporeans are also very patriotic. But you all don't understand. This is our affair... Are you all Singaporeans or not? Look, the government has to-- The government asked you to drink coffee and keep quiet, huh? I have to go now. Drink your coffee. So how much did you pay for this? Wow, that means you're stepping on $30,000 everyday. So how much did you pay for the whole renovation? Wow, so expensive. That's right. Hey, you're spending a lot of money. Ninety percent of them are malnourished and have no food... Hey, you better eat slowly. You know so many kids die watching TV and eating at the same time. Let them alone. This is Singapore.
