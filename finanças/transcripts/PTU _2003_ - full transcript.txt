Now the headlines at North Point this morning, 4 gunmen robbed 18 million dollars from an armored car. Please turn it up. One police officer was shot in the head and pronounced dead 15 minutes ago.. Another funeral to attend. Stupid! Should've waited for backup I've partnered with him. In one of the operations last year he was too nervous to use the gun. Where did he get the courage this time? Should've save it for girls. We'll finish the job for him! An officer is dead. What if people hear this? What if his family hears this? Anyone wearing the uniform is one of our own. Whatever happens, nothing beats returning home safely. Ponytail, 5 people? Here's a table. Alright. I'll bring you beer and take your order 2 bottles. Sorry kiddo, please move. Thanks. Sorry. Sorry.

I'm bored at the station I want to learn from you. Me? You should go to Kat's team. The Superintendent approved my request. Did he send you to check on us? No. No? Of course not Mike. What? Let's drop this. Tell Lo to find the gun himself. No need to risk our jobs for him. Besides, Orderly is here. You make your own decisions, okay? If we can't help Lo by dawn, then so be it. Where have you been, fat boy? What's up, Uncle Chung? Eye Ball is looking for you. He's been calling you. My phone never rang. The battery is dead. Got a spare one? Everyone is looking for Eye Ball. Saying he killed Ponytail. He has nothing to do with it. His men acted on their own. Not my business. CID took over the investigation. What Eye Ball wants is for you to turn him over to the police on the condition that he won't be mistreated. Bald Head lost his son. Police protection is useless. Just do it. Call Eye Ball when it's ready. Remember to return my battery. Wrong number. Madam. Any news on Eye Ball? Call me as soon as you hear anything. Yes, madam. Better clean yourself up. We can't protect you forever. Being an undercover cop gives me no choice. Police. Freeze! Quiet! Quiet! Drop the knife. Drop the knife! Wipe if off. Wipe if off! I thought it was those bastards. Where are the punks? Those bastards took them away. Who are they? How should I know? How long have they been gone? Just now. You need to call the police? You need police assistance? This is Lo. I can't answer your call. Leave a message. Lo. Wrong number sorry. I said wrong number! Is this 99272127? No, I'm not Lo. Give me. Who is this? Check who owns this phone. Yes, madam. Wrong number. Ponytail.. What Ponytail? What number did you.. Ponytail? Everyone said you're dead.. Who are you? I got your son's phone? What Bald Head? You're Bald Head? I'm looking for Bald Head. Wait. You came from the restaurant? Yes. The punks are here. Why are you looking for them? Don't play me. You know why I know you had a fight with my son I know you have his mobile I know Eye Ball ordered the kill I know Big Eye is your friend, right? I'm not involved I'm only trying to find my gun. I can't handle this. I just want my gun back. If you help me to put Eye Ball down I'll give your gun back. You want me dead? I'm a cop! Why did my son have to die? Why not you? Why did my son have to die? Why not you? My son have to die.. Mike, it's Lo. What's wrong with your phone? The punks didn't know Ponytail was murdered I know. Where are you? We need to talk. Let's meet at the diner. See you there. Got it. The phone really belongs to Lo. Eye Ball, it's Lo. It's all arranged I'll take you to the station. Okay. Don't worry. We're closed. So? Later... 4 am. Waiter. Coming Kat, what do you want? Lemon coffee. What is it? Don't patrol Canton Rd. At 4. Can you sign in at 4:30 instead? Found your gun? It's 2 already. Everything will be over after 4. Help me. We're closed. CID What? Have you seen the driver of the yellow paint car? He's upstairs. Thanks. Good thing your car was easy to spot. Why do you have Ponytail's mobile? It's a mistake. I answered his phone but there are no leads. Eye Ball has called you. What's Lo up to? Don't know, madam. We ran into him here. What's Lo up to? Don't know, madam. We ran into him here. What's Lo up to? I really don't know, madam. Madam. Anything happens to Lo, you'll all be held responsible. Bald Head, it's Lo. Eye Ball will be at Canton Rd. At 4. Buddy. Can you break this? Buddy. No need. This is May. Sorry I can't answer your call right now. Madam, it's me. Got something? Tail Bald Head if you want to find Eye Ball. Bald Head will make his move tonight. Okay. Drive. This is May.. I'm sorry. It's me. So? Eye Ball said he didn't order the kill. His men acted on their own. What if I were to tell you I don't have your gun? Eye Ball is mine. You'll get your gun back. Nothing will matter after tonight. Better keep your promise. The car key. Boss, I'll have the boys to go with you. Don't you dare! Eye Ball has to die tonight, or I'll lose my reputation! Follow him Mike, time to sign the patrol box. It's 4. Go check on that kid. We'll sign in from here. Yes. Don't forget you're not an officer. Why are we skipping Canton Rd.? Give the Superintendent a call. Go back to him. What will I tell him? That Lo asked you to skip Canton Rd.? Anything you want. Anyone wearing this uniform is one of our own. We're on the same team! You know this isn't right. We'll all get into trouble for this. It's not too late to stop him. Moron. Big Brother ls the boat here? Yes. We're just around the corner. Understood. Answer the phone!
