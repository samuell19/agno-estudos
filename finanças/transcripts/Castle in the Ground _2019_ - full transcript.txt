[gentle music] [gentle piano music] [somber music] [crunching] [creaking] [Rebecca sighing] - Morning. - Good morning, my love. Hm. [Rebecca sighing] Hm. [train rattling] Hm. [Rebecca groaning softly] [water rushing] [Henry praying] [cellphone buzzing] [Henry] Mom? We got to go. [upbeat music] [woman] Yo, Stevie. It's on. Polo Boy is coming. He's coming. Hello? Stevie? Fucking phone. - [Rebecca] Baby, put your seatbelt on. - Okay. [Rebecca sighing] [buckle clicking] I heard you praying again this morning. So? Well, you never pray. That's not true. - What were you praying about? - Doesn't matter. I was just, like, praying. Nothing specific. Just... You praying for your mother to get better? - Mom... - Were you praying for me to get better? - Mom! - You love me. Why do you have to know so bad? I don't have to tell you. I don't have to tell you every time I pray - what I pray for. - [laughing] [Rebecca] You don't have to worry, baby. I'm going to be fine. Going to be just fine. [knocking] - Yes? - [man] You got to move. This is where the ambulances come in. Can I have 30 seconds, please? - [man] I'm sorry, man. - My mom's in there. - [man] No. You got to go now. - [knocking] See? [switch clicking] - [knocking] - Shit. One second. Goddamn it. [lock clacking] - [sighing] Sorry. - [Rebecca] It's okay. [Rebecca groaning] - How'd it go? - Hm, yeah. Good, A-okay. [sighing] Seatbelt. [sighing] What'd he say? Said I'm good. [Rebecca sighing] Did you look at schools? [muffled upbeat music] Mm-hm. Did you really? Yes. Swear to God. I just don't want you wasting another year. That's what I've been doing? You know what I mean. You get better, then I'll go to school. That's the deal. [cellphone buzzing] Not at the table, please. - What's with you? - Could you just turn it off, please? Please? [cellphone buzzing] Henry, can you tell your girlfriend... - Rachel. - Yes, Rachel. Please, tell her, Rachel, that we're eating. They're giving me confusing directions. [chuckling] Henry? [cellphone buzzing] Sorry, Mom. Sorry. [chuckling] Mom, this is all delicious. I'm sorry, but may I, please, be excused? Yeah. [muffled upbeat music] [Rachel] Hi, sorry it took so long. Can't really hear you. I'm sorry I didn't call before. Oh, it's okay. My day was just, it was nuts. [Rachel chuckling] Really? What happened? Nice to meet you too. Bye. Uh, sorry. Yeah, uh, it was fine. I met my roommate, and... it sounds like you're at a party. No, I have a new neighbor. So, are you coming? Yeah, I'm going to leave in a second. Okay, I can't wait to see you. [guy] Yo. Hello? Sorry, yeah, me too, I... - [guy snorting] - I'm excited. I love you. - Love... - [guy sighing] Been here a while? Hope you don't mind me asking, but, uh, how old are you, man? 19. Why? No reason. Just curious. So, why they call you Polo Boy? No one calls me that. Oh, sorry, uh. Richard, right? No. Um, I live right here. [chuckling] That makes a lot more sense. Anyways, I'm Stevie. - Henry. - Yeah, nice to meet you, Henry. You too, Stevie. Well... [groaning] - [woman] Yo. - [Stevie snorting] - [woman] How long? - [knocking] [Henry sighing] [woman] Yeah, yeah, Steve will be here. Actually, sorry. - Can you tell her to turn the music down? - [woman] Can you hear me? - My, my mom is just... - [woman] Can you hear me? ...she's trying to sleep, and she needs her rest, so. - For sure, Henry. Yeah. - [woman] I'll see you soon. And whatever you do, don't ever take her shit. [knocking] [woman] Stevie! - Yes! - Yeah! What's up? - [woman] Hey, how you doing? - Oh, so good. I do need you to turn your music down, though, because this young boy's mother is trying to sleep. Sorry. [woman] Hey, Stevie... [explosions booming] [Henry] Ooh! Mm! - Hi. Hi. - Hi. [gentle music] [Rachel] Can you come over? [Henry] I got to get back. I'll see you tomorrow. Hopefully. [loud thudding] [man] Yo, Ana, open up. [loud thudding] [Rebecca] Henry, who is that? [man] Yo. I can hear you. [muffled upbeat music] [loud thudding] [Ana] Who, who the fuck is that? What the fuck are you doing here? [Ana laughing] Come meet my friend Stevie. What is going on? Nothing. Everything's fine. Just go back to bed. I need another one. When did you take the last one? You want me to get it myself? - I can do that. - No, no. I'll do it. I'll do it. All right. [rattling] [clanking] [Rebecca] Where's your girlfriend tonight? [Henry] She's at some party. [Rebecca] Mm. And you're stuck here with me. [Henry] I'm not stuck here with you. [Rebecca sighing] I want to be here with you. Sometimes, I'm needy. I know. [Henry chuckling] - Mom? - Hm? What's going on with you? Nothing. [water rushing] [Henry] Anyway, sorry this is a long message. Call me back, if you can and you want to or, you know, I hope you're having fun. [loud thudding] [muffled upbeat music] [loud thudding] [muffled yelling] [Ana screaming] What the fuck! [pharmacist] It says here you missed a UTOX. [Ana] What? No, I didn't. Oh, you know what it is? [Ana clicking tongue] My phone is busted. See? [pharmacist] You'll have to contact your doctor. But I sampled clean. It says it right there. So, can I please just have my Tang? [pharmacist] Can I help you? Hi, uh, pickup for Miss Rebecca Fine. [pharmacist] Okay. Give me a minute. [Ana] Could you please fill this, then? - [Ana sniffling] - [pharmacist] Where'd you get this? Where do you think I got it? I got it from the doctor's office. We should call the police. Okay, yeah. [clapping] Yeah. You should call the police. You should get them on the phone right now. I will tell them a little bit about what it is you guys do here, about the croaker scripts that you filled yesterday. You're not going to help me out? Wow. The way that you treat people is horrifying. You should be ashamed. You should be ashamed of yourself. Actually... - Thank you. - [rattling] [pharmacist] Excuse me. Excuse me, sir? Sir? She can't use these at the same time as her fentanyl patch, okay? Okay. Thank you. [pharmacist] Have a good day. Hi. Are you okay? Sorry. I'm your neighbor. No. No, I'm not, because, um, they are profiling me, and I didn't do anything wrong. And, um, my phone, my phone is busted. See? So, what am I supposed to do? It's not my fault. You know? Do you think you could, um, lend me 40 bucks? - I'm good for it, I swear. - Oh, I don't have any money. Just 20, then? I'm good for it, I swear. I really don't have any money. Sorry. There's someone watching you. I'm hypoglycemic. I kept the wrapper so I can pay. Can you leave me alone? Or I'm going to post a video of this bull-fucking-shit harassment. Think this shit shoots video? [Ana chuckling] Nope. [Ana chuckling] So, my mom's really sick. Aw. I'm sorry to hear that, man. You know, I mean, could you keep your music down? Sorry. Sure. Absolutely. Of course. Did you drive here? Yeah. Do you think you could give me a quick ride somewhere? Real close by. - Please? - Oh, uh... You asked me for a favor and I said, "No problem." Come on. How is being quiet a favor? Exactly. So, what did they do, the pharmacy? You said they, um, they should be ashamed of themselves. What do they do, they hook you, pull the rug. They hook you, they pull the rug. And you have to start over and over, and they get paid for life. That is what they do there. Oh, and they fuck up your life. They fuck you. What have you got there in that bag? Just some allergy pills. Could I borrow your phone? Thanks, man. ♪ Space, time ♪ [Henry mumbling] Polo Boy, I'm done. Be safe. Bye. Stevie, where the fuck are you guys? I've been trying to get a hold of you all morning. Nobody's picking up their fucking phones and mine was busted, so I'm calling you from some random dude's mobile device. And, uh, yeah. Fucked up, man. Fucked up. Right? [Henry] You are okay? I saw what happened last night. [Ana] What? - Oh, no, no, no, no. - [car honking] [Ana] Don't even worry about it. Could you stop here? [door clacking] [Henry sighing] [piano chiming] [Henry sighing] [Henry] Hello? [clanking loudly] [sighing] Goddamn it. Hello? [clanking loudly] Hello? [somber music] [door creaking] [Ana] What are you doing here! Jesus! What are you doing here? - I have to go. - Okay, just one more second. No, no, I really have to go, - right now. - Relax. Your allergy meds are fine. - [Henry sighing] - Okay, can I just borrow your... No, I don't have any fucking money. - I already told you. - Your phone, please, if that's okay. - [Henry sighing] - [Ana] Hi, can I please have Dr. Hurst? It's Ana. Yeah, that Ana. Thanks. Hi, Dr. Hurst. Could you call the pharmacy for me? They won't give me my methadone and I'm crawling out. No, I missed my UTOX because my phone was busted. But it's not like I'm asking for a carry, and anyway, I didn't do anything wrong. Can you write me a scrip, then? Why not? So, when I only needed one to get better, you gave me a hundred. And now, I need a hundred just to get well and you won't even give me one? [clacking] [Ana] Wow, okay. I hope that you are so fucking ashamed of yourself. [clacking] [Ana] Doc fucking Oxy. [Rebecca] Henry? Hello, doctor. Take that silly thing off. Feel a little sick. Every little thing counts, Mom. [Rebecca] Mm. [Rebecca sighing] Promise me you'll go to school, or I'll come back and haunt you. That's not funny. I'm not, I'm not being funny. You get better, and then I go to school. - That's the deal. - Yes, but, um, we have to prepare now, uh, Henry, for every outcome. What does that mean? It means that, um, things have, have not gone the way that we hoped. I've relapsed, and they want to do everything again. All of it, plus stem cells. When do you start? I don't know yet what I'm going to do, Henry. What does that mean? Mom, we have to get ahead of this. We got to start right now if we want to do anything. What "we"? Henry, listen to me. - Yosef and his wife... - No, Mom, what are you saying? - You're going to get better. - ...in the event, in the event that things don't work out, listen... - Mom... - ..listen to me! I need to say this. In the event that things don't work out, Yosef and his wife, they will help you. All right, my love? I'm really tired.

You can carry your little taser toy around with you now. But you forget, I used to babysit you, so you cut the shit. Banana, as soon as I get here, there's a guy holding us up. That doesn't seem fishy to you at all? [Ana] Okay, I had a gun to my head. My door was busted in, and you think that I set you up? [Richard] No, not you, Stevie.

Did you know the pills were fake? [Richard] What? Did you know the pills were fake? No, the pills weren't fake. [Jimmy] Yeah, they were fake, yeah. How do you know?

It's okay. Shh. Can you just put him, put him back on. Okay, okay, okay, okay. We'll get it for you, but we only give it to Richard, in person, alive and well, or you're never going to see it again. Tomorrow is fine. Can you put... [sighing] If we could just stay the night. Just stay, that's it. [Henry sighing] And a ride, just a ride, and then we'll be done. If you don't want to, then I totally understand. Just they know who you are now. [door clacking] You can put us anywhere. Please, man? Jimmy's got a couple good pops. We'll share them with you, okay? [Henry] Why does anyone care this much about a bag of stupid fake pills? Well, uh, you can sell it for, for a lot of money right now. that's why, a lot of money. [sniffling] We're just going to give it to them? Yeah. Yeah. And then what? That'll be it, they'll, they'll just leave us alone after that? Yeah, yeah. You don't have to worry. [Henry] How do you know? Well, because all they want is the fucking bag, and they're going to get it. I know it doesn't seem like it, but everything's going to get better. [Henry] Oh. Are you okay? - She okay? - [door thudding] Yeah, she's fine, she's fine. [Ana coughing] I just want to say that I'm, I'm sorry that you got roped into all of this. You seem like a good kid. Thanks.

[Ana] Henry... you're okay, man. It's my fault that my mom died. [Ana] What do you mean? I put the patch on. I'm the one who killed her. Henry. Yeah? It's not your fault. [bullets clicking] Hey, you said you'd be cool, man. It's just a precautionary measure. [sniffling] There's nobody in there. Nobody gives a shit about your fake movie gun, either. Who said it was a movie gun? Henry, I never want to see your face again, okay? You're a good kid. He's a good kid, he's a good kid. Back in a second. [Jimmy groaning] [sighing] [sighing] [men chattering] [tense music] [man] Surprise, surprise. [Jimmy] What the fuck are you guys doing here?
