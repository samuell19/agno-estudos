No one... no one needs me. Why did they leave me behind? Why you didn't take me with you? What did I do wrong? The day my mother left me I made up my mind not to trust anyone anymore. If I didn't, I wouldn't be alive. I'm used to being alone. I can survive without social interaction. But I couldn't find a reason for my existence. Once you can't trust anyone no one will trust you anymore. And then you stopped believing in yourself. I'm all alone. I have become a transparent person. By the time I realize there's no place for me in this world. I'm just gonna have to run and hide. Cooking is my only hobby since I was a kid. If anyone could just say, “it's delicious” it's like giving me a reason to live. Next up is today's lucky and happy horoscope. Today, Libra in 8th place and may be deceived. You must calm down before you deal with anything. The lucky color is blue. The unlucky color is yellow. Ooba, it's a travel agent's day. This is not the place where I can be accepted. I know there's no such place in the world. This isn't the real me. I'm sorry. But I know it's just a pathetic illusion. Even so... I think I'm gonna keep looking for the place where I belong. The place that belongs to the real me. When I met those people it felt like there was blood flowing through the dried veins. Like the black and white world emerged bright brilliant colors. I'm looking forward to that colorful world but I didn't know when it would come. then it became a place I had to visit in my life. Guanajuato. Mexico. Welcome, have you decided? I want to... I want to go to this place. Wait a moment, please. Can you help me with this? Your name is Ooba Kanako*? (* "a big stupid kid") Sorry to have kept you waiting. Plus wine machine it costs 300,000 yen. PART-TIME JOB'S SALARY: 300,000 YEN There must be something wrong. Normally, you'd never make 300,000 yen in this kind of part-time job. I got it. If you want to get something you must take corresponding risks. I'd rather have nothing to ask for. I'd rather know nothing. As long as you don't make a choice nothing's going to happen. That's always been my rule of life. Hello. I'm Ooba. Ooba Kanako. Driving a car? I can do it. See, I knew this was gonna happen. That's why I've always been reluctant to make my own decisions. Please don't kill me! I'll do anything. Please don't kill me. Cherry Honey Pie. Oh my god. This is all your fault, Ooba Kanako. My fault? Yeah, it's all your fault. Ooba Kanako. 4 HOURS EARLIER I let you drive my car. Do you understand? Cherry Honey Pie. I'll be right back. Wait here for me. Be quiet! Don't ask for anything, you'll be paid 300,000 yen.

It hurts! Watch where you're going, stupid! How the hell do you drive? I got shot, right here, it hurts. Don't! Don't! Please, don't kill me! I'll do anything. Please. Don't you want to say something? I'll do anything you want! I didn't ask you about that. I... I … I won't let you suffer. I mean, it would be good to keep me alive. What's good for us to keep you alive? I... I... What would I do? What am I good at? Cooking. Cooking. I used to cook delicious food. Used to? I can cook food. I can cook delicious food for you. She says she cooks well. Say it, “watch out the ball” “Watch out the ball” Yes. Ball... Diner Excuse me. Sorry, where is this? My name is Ooba Kanako. Let me see your arms. Yes. You haven't ever taken any drugs, have you? I haven't. You will work here 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. Roger. This is the place to serve our guests. Will you be able to serve your guests wholeheartedly? I will. Everything must be done according to my rules. Got it. Never betray me. I will never. What can you do? I can cook. The boss here that paid for you is me Bombero. Bombero. You can't get out of here. I'm the king here. Even a grain of sugar obeys my orders. If you disobey, you will be died. This restaurant is called diner, using a membership system. A place that provides food and alcohol for customers to have fun. The regular customers. No matter what kind of guests, we treat them the same. But we must not have any further emotion with them. Okay. All the guests are killers. This is a Diner for the killers. For the killers? All the customers you serve are killers. If you misplaced the plates, it may lead you to death. You might think I just took up a little life. But you're wrong. Look at them. They used to be waitresses that worked here on last Friday. Sooner or later, you will also be hung on the wall. - Come here. - Come on. - Yoohoo. - Come here. - We're waiting for you. Start cleaning. Remember, it must be clean enough to be licked. Do it like your life depends on it. - You done? - Yeah. Lick it. I told you before, clean enough to be licked. But you didn't say who will lick it... 7 hours 23 minutes. Obaa Kanako. You're breaking the record. I should have said no Duroc's going to run out tomorrow. If you can't get Duroc and Yorke by tomorrow don't ever do business with me again. Safe box? What's this? I don't have time for this. I have a hostage now. Hostage? The passkey is “5 6 4 8”, and “a killer”, right? Anyway, it was correct and I opened it. There's a beautiful bottle in it that I've never seen before. That's Diva Vodka! My hostage is that Diva. It's the best Vodka in the world, it filtered out through the diamonds. Counting the diamonds in the bottle they're worth over 100 million. I hid it. You won't find it. I'll kill you first and slowly I'll find it. You brought me here to work. I didn't buy you. Let me do the work. You're a tough motherfucker. I'll kill you and I'll have 100 men come looking for it. People who don't know will fall it down when they touch it. I'm sure it'll fall to pieces. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Go to the lobby. We are open. Roger. To get into the store, you need to pass through three doors. No one can open the three doors. I confirm through the monitor. I'll unlock the doors if I think the guest can come in. - He's creepy. - Yuck. Welcome to Diner. Bom, I can finally take a break. I can finally get some decent food. Go wait in the private room. What song? Sorry, I'm bothering you. Isn't my face funny? No, I don't think so. Then what do you think? I don't think anything about it. That's impossible, my face will definitely make people think. Is it the face of a cat crushed by a car or the rotten kitchen waste? Sportswear bag. A bag for sportswear. My mother made it for me. It's done. Here, take it. Thank you. I'm so sorry. Think of me as a sportswear bag. My name is Skin. What's your name? Ooba Kanako. Ooba Kanako (a big stupid kid). That's a weird name. My parents divorced. My mother asked a friend to give that name to me. There's a sportswear bag for you, what a good mother. I envy you. But she took my sister with her. And left me alone at grandma's house. Is there any particular reason? I don't know. Maybe she didn't want me. Please don't do this. Please stop it. Please stop it. Please stop it. Please stop. Bombero! Where did this delicious fresh meat come from? The last one, you guys messed her up. I bought it again. That's pretty good. Let go of me! Bombero, sell her to me. Please. Sell her to me. Let's make an offer. Bombero, make an offer! Her price must be only 80 or 100. 80? Incredible. It's deal, I buy her. Is everything okay? I'm okay. I'm not asking about you. If you sell me to those people, you'll be in trouble. You will be very busy. Then, give that Diva now. I won't let them buy you. I can't. I see. Here you come, my girl. Get her over here. Please stop. I've been calling out to her, you guys can't hear me? Can I order first? I came to eat. I thought the cook was in the kitchen. You stupid rag face. Let her go. Don't fuck with me! She is already ours. Get the fuck out of here, you asshole. Fuck. Stop it. I'm here to tell you. Don't mess with him. Looks like it's too late. Bom, I'll pay 800. I'll pay 800 for Kanako. 800? What do you think, Burro? Would you like to pay a higher price more than Skin's? Eat something delicious or he will die. We're here to eat, right? Yes, big brother. I order the volcano lava cake and a honey souffle. Take it. The volcano lava cake. My mother. She's so beautiful. You look terrible. Can't eat good food and have no time to rest. He put you up to a mess. Come on. Taste it. Don't look at him as a fierce, he has a talent for cooking. I'm sorry, I have to go. I don't think she didn't want you. Your mother. Are you the new professor? Keep an eye on that kid. Welcome. Miss. Hey, Bombero. She's new here. Hello, ma'am. It's like you're being blown by the early summer breeze in Paris. In Montmartre一 If you want to talk, find a place to sit. I'm so busy here. If you want to talk, find a place to sit. I'm so busy here. How was that? Have I learned well? Yeah, that's pretty good. Thank you for waiting. Wow. Moulin Rouge! Wow, I can't stand it anymore. The Moulin Rouge is so fond of letting me stay drunk all night. Santé! This is Skin's souffle. Skin's souffle. Repeat after me. Skin's souffle. Be sure you don't get it wrong. Roger! Excuse me. Here, Kanako, put it here. Put it between me and my mother. Sorry to have kept you waiting. Actually, what I want to eat most is this souffle. He's such a genius. I described the souffle my late mother used to make for me. And he made a souffle that exactly has the same taste as my late mother used to make. No one like him can be found in the world. Bombero he was a top-notch killer. The man who gave him the store and money the man who let him wash his hands was the boss of the killer organization that died a year ago. Delmonico. Let me tell you something, Kanako. I'm living for this souffle. Kanako. This. You should definitely taste it. Before and after eating, your life will be changed. This is definitely my mother's souffle. I'm sorry, I'm gonna go to get another one. I'm sorry to interrupt you. This thing was in Skin's souffle. I wasn't mixed it up, I put it up on purpose to get him to eat it. He was so looking forward to it. He deserves that kind of souffle. Even so … The last time was the blade and chess piece. You are wrong, it was a rook. It has a good attack power when it takes an action but it's too hard to control. It's just like you. He would never let me have a perfect souffle. Sooner or later. I'm so sorry. It's okay, Kanako. Bom was right. I only deserve that souffle. Here. For you. Keep your best. Thank you so much. Miss. Get us a bottle of tequila. Okay. Tequila, tequila. Bug. Oh, my God. What the hell is this place? I'm not sleeping. I'm just sitting here for a minute. Miss, you were caught up, too, right? Let's run away with me. If it goes on like this, you and I will be killed. I don't want to die. But... But I can't escape. Look at these. It's all professor's. These kids had the same age as me. In order to train these kids he tied them up alive. Then let me take them down. But I couldn't do it. So it's gonna be me who gets killed next. The professor took kids like me from orphanages and turned them into murder weapons. Kill them right away when he doesn't need them anymore. What should I do, miss? He's going to kill me. Run away with me, please. If you want to die and do whatever you want. But give me back the Diva before you get killed. Your head was in the mouth of the Tiger. Why didn't you feel anything? You afraid of the death, and want to live. First, think about how to cure your mental retardation. The ignorance is also a sin. Soon you'll understand. - Stop it. - It hurts. You hurting me. Bombero, get him out of here. No, I don't want to. Get off of him, shorty! Don't do it! I won't say it again. I'll kill you. Don't! Wait, wait, don't do this. Stop it, Kid. Let him go now! Get your hands off him! No! Who are you calling shorty, huh? How was it? Dare you to smile again and see! Try this, kid. Stop it! Fuck. Hey! Burro, get the hell out of here. Find another place to play. What's up? Just a little bit more. That's not enough. I want to play! I want to play! Just wait, you will get the retaliation. Ugly hag! You're in charge of the dead bodies. Great. I'll do it. I'll do it. Great! Okay, where can I cut? Start here. Have a seat. This is today's reward. Drink it. Laugh at me again! It'll be cheaper to pay a cleaner if the body became pieces. Countless plastic surgeries on the entire body through hormone injection. His bones get treated to make him look like a kid. I don't know his real age. But he's definitely older than you. Why did he do that? Because it's easier to do his works with that body. No one would have thought a kid would be a killer. That professor is just a setup. Lautrec, that's not going to work. He won't live long. He knew what he had done to himself. He knows clearly what the consequences of what he has done. But he can't stop. Crazy. Every killer is crazy. This is where you make delicious food for crazy people to eat. Huh? Did you release it... Your time to sleep or die all the decisions are always in my hands. Hello. Bombero. It's only a week until the first anniversary of our boss, Delmonico. Yes. In a year's time, big brothers from all regions will come to have a meeting. The East Evil, Mateba. Such a perfect existence. I wish I could swallow it. The Wild West, Maria. I have killed all of them. The North Poison, Bureizu. Beauty is justice. Don't you think so? And I, Coffie, will come too. It's so smooth. An orange without a single strand of fibrous inner layer. That's all I need in my life. The fibrous... you missed a single strand of it. Bombero. This time I want to entertain everyone with one bottle of Diva Vodka. Is that okay? Of course, as you wish. Do you want that Diva Vodka badly? That's a great Vodka, isn't it? All of the four teams did well for Delmonico this year. It deserves one bottle of good vodka, right? It would be nice to be safe on that day. But the maggots on the street are getting restless. Is it because of that rumor again? Groundless statement. Our boss was killed by that damn car accident. The Delmonico's death maybe some people don't want to believe it's an accident. He wouldn't die in a normal car accident. And also the ring representing the authority of the organization is gone. That's right. I've combed the scene of the accident several times I couldn't find that ring. But... Coffie... What really happened Delmonico was killed and disguised as a car accident. The killer is the one with that ring. What makes you think it was an accident? In fact, don't you think there are still a few questionable points in that accident? Boss. Mateba. If what you said is true then I really need to take this seriously. Six days later, big brothers are coming here for a meeting. Diva Vodka will have to be given away by then. Diva? This is your last chance to give me the Diva back. Kanako, give the Diva back to Bom. Do you really want to die now? Kanako. Come with me. Skin has bought you. You're free now. So tell him where the Diva is. - Hey! - Just tell him, okay? I'm sorry. I'm sorry, because... because I want to live, it's all I have left. If I give it to him I don't know what's gonna happen. We'll both be dead if you don't give me that Diva before the party. Then I'll give you it before the party. Kanako, you promise? She can't trust you right now. Well, she won't be live long. Six days until the party. Can you live to that day? - Welcome back. - You're back. Are you still going to kill me after you get the Diva? Because just now, you look so damn happy. Because my buddy's out of the hospital. Buddy? He's the toughest killer I know. Kill without batting an eye. This is my buddy, Kikuchiro. He likes strawberries best. He'll be watching over you. If you don't listen to me, you'll be a strawberry. Thank you so much. I'll go shopping. Don't let any guests in. Understand. Don't try to run away either. Do you have anything to do with me? Strawberries? I don't have strawberries, no strawberries. You see? This is a strawberry candy. What should I do? Can I pick it up? But Hello, this is Diner, what's up? It's me, Bombero. I'm sorry, the voice is intermittent. Kid? Let him in and wait, okay. How to do it? It's Kid. He covered by blood. Bombero said let me wait for him here. Yes. Would you like something to drink? As long as it's bourbon, anything is okay. Okay. Kikuchiro, you're back! Do you know him? Yeah. He is a super-badass killer. When he's done, he'll gobble them up. You opened the doors, didn't you? Then why don't you run? Because Kikuchiyo is watching over me. Really? It's not really a big deal. Do you actually like being here? What does that mean? Because even if you go out no one out there wants you back. Excuse me. No one feels sad when you're dead. Hello. It's me. Help me look in the fridge, salsiccia piccante (spicy sausage) how many it's left? But Kid's still waiting for you. You let him in? Didn't you ask me to let him in and wait for you just now? It wasn't me, he said it in my voice. I heard the professor screwed up the work. He was so angry, he cut that old man into pieces. It's supposed to be good that I'm not in the store. But he came for you, Kanako. He's going to kill you. Try to delay the time. Don't leave Kikuchiyo. Kanako, give me another glass. Yes. Who's on the phone? Bombero. He said a very complicated word, piccante or something. Ask me to see how much it's left in the fridge. Well, why don't you go and check it out? But what's salsiccia piccante? This is the reaper. Kanako. Since the day I met you I couldn't get you out of my head because... your eyes are the same as theirs. What does it look like? Those who don't know what will happen next. Those weak chickens that I killed so easily and didn't dare to fight back. I'll finish you, I'm not afraid of Bombero. Kanako be my last victim. Be quite! Yeah, yeah, that's the face. The face I've been looking forward. Showtime. Don't. Die! Stupid son of a bitch. Don't! Let's get it started. It's going to the climax. It's not fun to be alive but you're still afraid of dying, huh? Don't come any closer! Stupid son of a bitch. Kikuchiyo! I'm all right now. Stop biting him. Stop it! Stop it, Kikuchiyo! Stop it. Get out. I was about to get rid of him anyway. It's a shame, I want to kill a few more before I die. Kill one after another. One after another. Kanako, it's something you eat, not for you to see. This is for you, grandma. Kanako, you're doing great. My dream is to open a restaurant for my mother to eat. So I'm not a kid nobody wants anymore. Skin! Lie down first. Kanako. Who did this? I don't know. It has been two days I couldn't get in touch with my boss. Mateba? He asked me to find out the truth about Delmonico's death. He died in a car accident. He was killed, there's a traitor. Somebody in the organization killed him. Take a rest. Bom, I think you might have noticed. Skin, this conversation is over. Bombero, I advise you to be careful. Kanako. Yes? Keep an eye on this prick for me. I have something to deal with right now. Kanako. The song you hummed last time... My mother used to sing it. My mother used to sing it, too. Kanako. This is for you. Don't tell Bom. Thank you. Kanako. If anything happens Bombero's counting on you. Do you understand? I leave the souffle to you. Skin's souffle, right? Bake at 180 degrees in 18 minutes. Understand. Kanako. Sit here. Delicous. It's so damn delicious. Kanako. You will be able to get back to your old life soon. Actually, I have found my goal. Goal? When I was a kid my dream was to open a restaurant for my mother to eat. But now, she's not important anymore. I want to open a restaurant for myself now. I want to change people's lives. Then I'll have the courage to live. It's so delicious. It's so fucking delicious. Skin? It's so damn good to be alive. It's so damn good to be alive, Kanako! Kanako! No! No! Mom, I don't want to be your wire puppet anymore. No, I don't. Stop talking and disappear. Stop it! Disappear! Disappear! - Get lost! - Skin! Go to hell. Skin, you're safe, you're free now. - I'm free? - Right. You can live your own life now and do whatever you want. No, I can't. She'll scold me. She'll hate me. My mother will be disappointed in me. Seriously, it's okay. Put the gun down. Take that shirt off. She'd be really disappointed in me and would say she wouldn't want me. She'd say it's all my fault, she'd say it to me. She won't want you. I'm sure she won't want you. Don't stir him up, Kanako! Skin... It's all over. Mom... Mom... Mom... Mom, thank you. Mom, thank you. Skin? Skin? Skin? Skin? Say something, Skin. This is the detonator. He was going to detonate this. What did you do to him? Nothing. It's just that... Just what? I just took this thing out from the souffle. Skin has always wanted to eat the perfect souffle, and... he adored you so much. Shut up! Shut the fuck up! That's the switch that triggered him. That's what happens when he eats the perfect souffle. The perfect souffle was his dream. Once it's eaten there's no need to live. You know what? You don't know anything. Some people depend on a dream that never comes true to have the courage to live. You didn't understand anything. The mentally retarded people should die. I see. It's different than it was before. This time I know why I deserve to die. Get out. And never come back. I said get lost. You brought me here let me go through this without asking for my permission. Now all of a sudden I have to get out of here. I want to make the amazing dishes like yours. But nothing has started yet. I haven't learned anything yet. - It has nothing to do with me. - Of course it has. You said, just listen to your orders. You've said to obey your orders until the end. Don't abandon me like this. If you want to kill me, then make sure I die. Aren't you a killer? It's easy to kill me, right? Kill me, stupid! If you can't make up your mind, I'll help you. I'm going to stay here. Even if you don't need me, I'll stay here. I have never said I don't need you. Tasty. Think of the only person in your heart who eats your food. Do it with no distraction. Hey! At that time when you left the storage room I put it back into the safe box. But it might be found at any moment. I scared it would lead me to death. You're really such a tough girl. The city used to be divided into four territories and they worked independently. The boss of the organization who put them all in was Delmonico. But he died in a car accident a year ago. According to the rules, no one can inherit his throne until his first anniversary. The number two person in the organization Coffie, is currently in charge. But after today's party there will be no more restrictions. There's gonna be a bloodbath to fight for the position of the boss. Cheer up. A tiny mistake will cost you your life. Understand. It's been a long time, Bom. How do you do? Still so handsome. No way, you like this type of girl, that's hilarious. Do you want to join us? Only three? Mateba was killed. His body was found this morning. It's a pity that such a beautiful face is swollen like a diaper bag. He must have been killed a few days ago. We still don't know who's the killer. I'm gonna kill the one who killed Mateba. Watch out for the fire. This way, please. When will the Diva be served? After all the dust has settled. Understood. Why, I want to drink it right now. I'm the kind of person who has to taste something delicious first. This is a great Vodka, we have to wait until we avenge Mateba. The great day requires great Vodka. You are so funny. I think so, too. Bombero, let's get started. But after all, who did it to a handsome guy? People who want our lives. I will kill them. A meat cake made of six kinds of meat beef, pig, duck, deer, lamb and bear the last, Salvia was used for fumigation. This dish is ultimate sextuplex. Wow, this is our boss's favorite dish. Did you guys know that Mateba asked Skin to check something? Boss asked me to find out the truth about Delmonico's death. He was killed. Bom, did Skin tell you anything? He didn't tell me anything. Bombero, you want me to kill you right now? Bureizu! He didn't tell me anything. I won't be able to eat the food you make anymore. It's a shame. Wait! On that day Skin gave me this. Inside this. Oh, my dearest boss. Coffie. No, it's not me. That ring was given to me by Delmonico before the accident. He asked me to inherit his place. I'm not lying. Hey, Bombero. Bombero! Why you did that? It's all about business. Delmonico was so outrageous and he wanted to remove me from management. That's part of your plan, right? It's still about business. Do I really need to explain it, Bombero? I'll fucking kill you! You piece of shit. The boss can only be one. Don't you think it's beautiful to kill you. Girl, can you help me open the door? And then bring in Diva Vodka. Yes. Coffie don't you think this is the best time to open the bottle? Bombero would you like to follow me and keep this restaurant open? The one who discovered, trained and raised me was Delmonico. All right. But this girl knows too much. Alex. I'm gonna get rid of her. Bombero … I'm glad I worked here. Thank you. Bombero! Bombero! - Don't make any noise. - But! Follow me. It's all light wine. Put a towel in the mouth of the bottle. And what to do? Cooking. What, now? But... You will do it or not? I will! Remember I'll only teach you once. Look carefully. Okay! This makes the meat taste stronger and tastes better. Give it a try. Roger! Kanako! Focus on your five senses to awaken the desire in your body. Understand. The time of the searing are varies. Listen carefully to the sound of the cutlets. It feels like something's missing. Keep going. It's done. It's showtime. Kanako, come with me. Kikuchiyo. Kikuchiyo! Kikuchiyo! Stay in the storage room. Let me out! Bombero! Bombero! Bombero! Bombero! Bombero! Bombero! Bombero! Bombero! Open the door. Bombero! Bombero! I thought you were supposed to wait me in the storage room. Bombero! No! Bombero! Are you all right? This old exhaust duct goes three blocks away. There's a stepladder at the end. And what about you? I... I need to get some rest. Let's go together. I can't. Bombero! There's a piece of paper with the bank account number and password in it. Live willfully. Willfully? Face yourself and don't run away. The more you try to escape the more you'll be caught up. No one in this world sees you as nothing. You at least, you need yourself. And what about you? I don't need you. Hurry up, get out of here. Bombero. Be sure to come to my restaurant. I'm going to cook the foods better than yours. That's impossible. Be sure to come and eat. I'll reserve a seat for you. Got it? Hurry up, get out of here. Be sure to come to my place. You're really a tough girl. But it was fun. You a big stupid kid (Ooba Kanako). I'll see you then. I'm the king here. Even a grain of sugar obeys my orders. Admiral. If you disobey you will die. If you can't trust anyone you won't survive. If you can't trust anyone means no one trusts you. And then you even can't believe yourself. When I realize there is no place for me in this world. In a place where there is no escape I met a man. For the first time, I seriously faced up myself. That's where it all started. In the process of re-trusting myself again I finally understand the place where I belong and the place I've been looking for can only be built by myself. I'm right here now in the place that I've always dreamed of. I opened a small restaurant. I have a little dream. That little dream is to make foods that could change people's lives like he did.
