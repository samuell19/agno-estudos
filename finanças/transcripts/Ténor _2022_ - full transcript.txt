Antoine, come here. Be right back. Sure. Hey... - Team work. - Right. - What's up? - Can you go for me? Forget it. Last time I was late for school. It's right around the corner.

You've pulled this since nursery school. You're afraid of snakes, right? - And? - I don't judge you. Even Indiana Jones is afraid of snakes. This is rain. How do you take showers? You know I take baths. Go on, you're not a baby. Please don't let me down. Bruh, look me in the eye. I'm begging you. Please. Hello. Delivery for Josephine "Ojevski." - Where is she? - Olchewsky. Over there, to the right. - Where to the right? - Further down. You'll find it. Thanks. To the right? Is he joking? - Need something? - I got a Combo No. 4 for Josephine Olchewsky. That's her. Thanks. You can go. Sushi boy, this isn't your league. What's your problem? Calm down, Beethoven. You can't spell his name. I can sure spell "wimp." No surprise they deliver sushi. OK, big mouth, listen to this. You diss me for bringin' sushi But my balls don't need no Gucci Let her sing Have some class Don't be a bourgeois smart-ass! Think you're some big aristo-crass? Bet you buy your coke with Mommy's cash! You know I'm right Don't try to deny I'll mop the Opera with your necktie Your homies laugh at you, nanny You got a big mouth But you're no Pagny We good? Ma'am. Respect. Wimp. Wait. What? Do you know opera? She serious? Am I wearing a tutu? Here we have Expense Accounts "63." What do Expense Accounts "63" correspond to? Expense Accounts "63." Antoine, do you know? Sorry, I didn't hear. What are expense accounts "63"? Expenses related to taxes? Fantastic! That's exactly right. But don't forget VAT. Alright? VAT goes in the end-of-year balance sheets. Is this clear for everyone? Hello. Sorry, we're closed. We open at 7:00 PM for sushi. Thanks, I only eat sushi in Japan. Or California. Can I have the number of the person who made this delivery? Antoine. I'm not authorized to give out private information concerning my employees. You know... I can be very persuasive. Rembrandt, you cookin'? Elio, my man, hit it. Let me hear y'all! That's it. This is for my brah Didier! Yeah! Dude, you no star Stop actin' tough You no Booba, Gims or Nekfeu I bring maki but I call the shots Your rap is smoke and mirrors Like your biatch Don't confuse the Ace and the Valet All you good for is to sweep my chalet You like a stiff When you in the booth I Kalashnikov scum like you Come to my hood To see who rips off who Your mama's so fat I use a walkie-talkie I slip in like butter I dickslap that MILF and set her on fire Facial, interracial, hyperplasia I dig it when she sucks me off in a Dacia Like Omar Sy in Arsène Lupin You got a few tunes But no groupies want'cha You stink of defeat Like perfume Tonight you up against Jean Dujardin Don't ask for help cause I don't pardon Buffon you gonna get a Panenka Eat your Friskies, but digest this The best are from Rembrandt Fuck you and your hood, asshole I gonna repaint your portrait à la Picasso Let me hear ya! Antoine, from Rembrandt! And now... Emkal from Picasso! Let me hear ya'! Hit the sound. Hello, Picasso! Let me hear y'all! I got no time, let's get it over You want the buzz but you're scuzzy In Marseille, they call it old style Bro, you look like a pedophile You're so ugly I could go on for hours But my eyes sting from your odor Your rap stinks of mierda like yo mouth You rap or you shit? That his ass or his mouth? Who you think you are, new boy? I slam you, I bash you, stop drooling He feels little wings growing Angel, why your armpits got halos? You sweat, your hands are clammy I bet the dolls give him the whammy I saw the weather report Sun's shining But I need an umbrella cause he sputters Hang on, your mama's callin' I said to wait for me at the motel Your mama's as ugly as you I understand better why Your old man went elsewhere - Better luck next time. - Right. Nyah nyah nyah. Picasso, pick my nose. You think it's funny? Come clean, he hurt you bad. Thanks, I was there. - Chill, it'll pay off. - I got the rage. You insult my family, cunt? You mad cause I kicked your brother's ass? C'mon, chill. This scumbag thinks he can insult us? - That a challenge? - C'mon. Over my dead body. We're here for rap. Gang wars are over. And you... You want to fight? Get in a ring. I shit on your honor. Hypocrites. I see you in the hood, I'll smash your mouth in. You'll drink through your ear, Picasso runt. Laugh while you still have teeth. They insult us and everyone crawls. Count on Didier to liven things up. What's that mean? Those Picasso hobos broke our balls. And that's an excuse? You don't have to deal with shit like this. Your bro is Pascal the Great. Thinks he can reconcile France. Yeah, but he's never shamed me. Without him, you'd all be sewer rats. I don't want to argue with you. Let's change subjects. You're like a real couple. Jealous? I'm not jealous. Jealous of what? She's fuckin hot. She got green eyes. And she starts lookin' at me. I was like "what, me"? Yo. How'd it go? Cool. The asshole insulted your old man. What? What? It's true. - Where was I? - You were hitting on a babe. A rich biatch. Penthouse and everything. And you wake up with cum all over. You calling me a liar? Bastard. OK, go on. - What's her name? - I dunno, it's... You know, babes on Tinder. You never know their names. Only girl you ever kissed is your cousin Hafida. What about Hafida? - You know her? - Everyone knows her. - OK, I'm off. Good night, studs. - Leaving? - Gimme five. - You rocked tonight. Thanks, sister. Night, Officer. - Attention! - At ease! Why dontcha bang Samia? Serious, Samir? She's like my sister. Besides, she's enlisting. Who cares? The army excites me. I'd bang Lara Croft. You talk too much. She'd hammerlock you. Bullshit. Samir, time for bed! What's so funny? He's coming! - Son of a bitch, don't bang her. - It's his old lady. Shut your fat ass. Keep stuffing your face. They from Picasso? Rembrandt bitches! Come here, assholes! Calm down. Not gonna fight over a bottle. My shawarma! Don't eat that, there's glass. - Uh-huh. - You glutton. - Cost 6 euros. - Who cares? Fucking hell. Don't they have elevators? Hello. Oh, I see. What's the deal? Don't worry, there's no "deal." Can we talk 5 minutes? About what, the quality of my sushi? Not exactly. But it's a pity. You must be captivating when you talk about fish and fishing techniques. You're funny. Doesn't show at first. You flatter me. How about a vocal exercise? Sing your stuff, right now? It's called opera. If I'm wrong, you'll never hear from me again. Deal? - Have a nice day. - No! You're not going to make me order sushi 3 times a day? You won't give up. Here, a gift for you. Thank you. - You know him? - No. One of the greatest. He did something else too. - Deliver sushi? - No, pizza. He was a schoolteacher before he sang. Take this off. You'll be more at ease. And come over to the piano. Come on. Hurry up. Come here. - Focus on your diaphragm. - What's that? The muscle between the thorax and the abdomen. Always breathe here. Open your ribs and relax your face. Otherwise your jaw is tight. Not very nice. Whereas... Better, don't you think? I'll play and you follow. - Ready? - Yes. No, you're not. You can't sing slumped over. Good posture is essential for the energy to circulate. - Like this? - That's fine. I'll show you. Got it? Your turn. Good. Once again. Yes. - What? - What're you doing? I get it now. No, there's been a misunderstanding. - You're not my type. - Hey, I'm not a kid. You want men, there are apps for cougars. Fuck, she serious? I have all the apps. Hey, Antoine. How's the champ? You pouting? No, but some crazy old lady just hit on me. - No way! - Where? During a delivery. What, a cougar? I dunno what she wanted. Heavy shit, bro. You coulda gotten laid for once. - With an experienced woman too. - You pigs. I'd have gone for it. You fucked up. You're a dog. Bullshit, Abdel. Go back to your PlayStation. - He doesn't respect me. - Why should he? Mom, how are you? Very well, son. And you? I'm fine, nothing new around here. I see that. What happened to your face? You still fighting? No, it's nothing. It snowed here. I slipped on ice when I took the trash out. My face got bruised. Stop it! You're a terrible liar. How's Antoine? I told you yesterday, Mom. I'm fine. Stop worrying. A cougar almost ate him. I'm off to bed, sweethearts. Love you! - Us too, Mom. - Have a good day! She busts my balls with her stress. Give me the stick, motherfucker. Didier, Rule No. 1: never FaceTime with the folks. But he's right, cause parents are like girls. You don't answer, they get suspicious. - What's that? - What? Those antiques still exist? Last one I saw was in grade school. You went to school? - Why you laughing? - Bastard. Serious, what's up? I'm going upstairs. Don't have time for your BS. Didier, you're too hard on him. You a cop? Fuck off. - He needs to focus on school. - Exams are in a year. Yeah, they didn't wait till then to cash my check. So get to work. You're a pain. I want a "C"! I want the average! "C" isn't much. - "C" passes. - Even he got a "C." It passes. C'mon eat, we got work. - Shit, you scared me. - What are you doing? Listening to music. - How are you? - Good. Tomorrow's the big day. You're leaving? - How do you feel? - Hope I'm not making a mistake. Why do you say that? You've wanted this forever. I remember our teacher... What was her name? - Mrs. Clerc. - That's it. When you said you wanted to join the army, she almost fainted. "Samia, that's no profession for a girl!" Go ahead, make fun of me. When'd you say you wanted to an accountant? I do what I can. But you could do better. I'm off. 5:00 AM departure. Bye. Power to you. Hey, Samia. - Don't kill anyone, OK? - Promise. I know I was disrespectful, but I listened to the CD. I shouldn't have reacted like that. Hello. What's he doing here? Is she crazy? She better not mess with me. Antoine! What are you doing here? I came to apologize but I saw my boss... Stop right there. My private life is my business. I told you, you're not my type. It's your voice that interests me. So have a nice day. Hang on. You're right, it's not my business. One question. You really think I could express... - Yes...? - I don't know how to say it. - Emotion? - Yeah, that's it. Maybe with lots of work. OK, I want to try. Really? Then come back Thursday at 6:00 PM. Thursday. Fucking hell. The fight's tonight. I'll be there. Maybe just a little late. Why? I have class. Right, I forgot. You'll be fine. I hope so. Cause I got a bad "provision." A bad provision? When you sense something fucked up. That's a "premonition." - What? - It's called a "premonition." Yeah, must be that. Samir said you got smoked. Bums looking for trouble. I'd have settled it. That's what they want. Drop it. Those Picasso punks need to learn respect. Fuck, be careful. Forget to eat your spinach? You fucked my elbow. - Where you going? - Ciao. - I have a fight tonight. - See you. Come back! You'll hate yourself. Listen to your big brother! Come give me a kiss. Kid's oversensitive. Like his mom. Day 3. Haven't killed anyone yet but I'd sure love to. Cool, sister. Keep up the good work. :) That's it. It makes your vocal chords vibrate. Next step, no noise. Watch the bubbles. Noise or no noise, their size and number remain constant. Very good. You'll learn to control your breathing. If you say so. Very good. It's not fair. A man who seduces young women is a Don Juan. But a woman is a cougar. It's not nearly as nice. - You OK? - Yes, excuse me. Was that part of the lesson? Not really. It just came to mind. I feel kind of blonde doing this. Is this your revenge? To the contrary, it's a gift. You'll learn to keep a constant flow of air. It's the basics of singing. If I don't suffocate first. Do you like Victor Hugo? - You know his poetry? - By name. Come here. Tomorrow, at dawn, As the countryside whitens, I shall leave. I know you await me. By forest, by mountain, I can stay away from you no longer. Eyes closed in on my thoughts, I neither see nor hear, Alone, unknown, back bent, and sad. The day is like night. The golden eve falls, as distant sails make for Harfleur, I'll place on your tomb A posy of holly and heather in flower! See? Even in rap the air flow is constant. If you want to battle someday, let me know. You got the flow. Not today. Give me a "sol" right now. - See the difference? - It's loco. That's it, "loco." My exercise isn't bad, is it? Worthwhile feeling a bit "blonde." I have to get this. Carry on. And not one bubble outside the glass. - Think you can do it? - I'll try. Hello, Doctor. Yes. Thank you. Goodbye. OK. Change of plans. Feel like going to the opera? - Right now? - Yes. I'll go change. OK, I guess. It's so big, it's wild. - It's like a stadium. - You're right. There's the circle for the elite. The balcony for tourists. And at the very top... - My favorite place. - Up there? It's called "paradise." That's where real music lovers sit. Not the wealthy. The aficionados. They come for the love of opera. And sometimes more. What do you mean? It's an isolated, discreet place... Right, I see what you mean. - Why am I telling you this? - No harm done. BRO Where the fuck are you! 100 people work backstage for each performance. - Hi, Marie. - Hello, Celine. It's a huge machine. All so an artist can transmit his emotion. Marie! - I'm so happy to see you. - Me too. Antoine, this is Roberto Alagna. - Hello, Antoine. - Roberto. Bravo, I heard you sing. It echoed everywhere. Thank you. - Antoine is my new student. - Really? I hope you realize your luck. - Marie is wonderful. - I imagine. Can I leave him with you? Pierre! Marie, perfect timing! These people from Seoul want to meet you. You see the young man with Roberto? Yes, can't miss him. I want him to join the Atelier. The Atelier? This your latest whim? - The Atelier is full. - I know. But my job is also to recruit the best talent. And it'll resolve your "social diversity" issue. Thanks. - Where are you from? - Bondy. Bondy? We're almost neighbors. - For real? - I was born in Clichy-sous-Bois. Seriously? Clichy? What are you working on? This was my first day. I'm learning the basics. The straw exercise? Yeah, I did it earlier. She always loved that exercise. Really? Say, do you know Rigoletto? Rigoletto... No, is that an opera? Yes. It goes like this... Oh yeah! That's famous. Rap battles. Rap battles? You're not being serious. Yes, I'm very serious. A rapper? Is this a joke? No, Pierre. For the Seoul exchange, it would be fantastic... Stop right now. Even dead, I will never return to Seoul. Remember a few years ago when I covered for you? What if I stopped now? You'd have to go. Do you understand or not? Are you blackmailing me? Call it what you like. But that weirdo will never join the Atelier. - Pierre, I congratulate you. - Excuse me? Excellent new recruit. - We'll talk soon, Marie. - With pleasure. - Good luck, my friend. - Thank you. Thank you. I owe you that. Honestly. - See you soon. - Bye. - Hey, Dude. - Wassup? Life cool? - What's up? - I was at work. - And you? - The usual. Hard day? The routine. Long day. I worked with Elio. - How's school? - Fine. You see that? Shit, dude. Wassup, guys? Why're the pigs here? For your brother. Fuck, Didier! Hope he doesn't fuck up. He's in trouble. - Hey! - What's going on? Get lost. Get lost? I live here. I'm not goin' anywhere! - Bro, what's going on? - Keep it shut. I could nail you for complicity. You're lucky it's me. - I'm sorry, Bro. - It's better this way. Move it. - Where's he going? - Immediate trial. You shitting me? - Hey! - Free fighting's no joke. Fuck. Don't worry. Told you I had a bad provision. For your education... - You say "premonition." - And how do you say "asshole"? I'm serious! Shut up. Shit. What do you want? Trust me. He has extraordinary potential. Marie, please. You woke me up for that? Look, you had a good laugh with Alagna, but this is public funding. My hands are tied. The answer is "no." It's impossible, end of story. What if I said yes to Seoul? I thought even dead you wouldn't go back? You know women. We change our minds like the wind. You're a pain. A real pain. Why are you here? I can deliver sushi and like opera. How'd you get in the Academy? It's called "affirmative action." Ever heard of it? I'm Josephine. I remember. - Antoine. - It's a pleasure. You read music sideways? Not at all. I need to learn. Don't worry. You can use phonetics to place the words. Meaning? You write what you like if you can read it. - You mean... - Look. - Move it. - Huh? What's his problem? That's Maxime Lasserre. He's sure he's the next great Opera star. He's a far cry... but he already plays the role. Hello, everybody. - Antoine, come here. - Sure. This is Antoine. He's joining our class today. Hello. Excuse me, what's his tessitura? Antoine is a tenor. By the way, could you answer any questions he might have to help his integration? Let's start, we have a big day. Jean? Today, we will review the difference between assets and liabilities. Under the category of assets, you have... real estate. Excuse me, ma'am. I have a gift for you. Here. - Dupac? - 2Pac. 2Pac is a rap legend. Like Pavarotti. - I'll take note. - Cool. - Thank you. - Welcome. Goodbye. - What's up? - A whole crew came and smashed the door in. - How is he? - They threw him in the clink. He's in the shit. Someone from Picasso snitched. Maybe, I dunno. Want a chip? If you're offering me chips, I must be pathetic. Where were you anyhow? At school. Class ended late. The one day I'm not there, he gets nabbed. I'm so pissed at myself. Don't be. You'd be in jail too. Think of your mom. What am I gonna tell her? A big lie, like when we were kids. It didn't even work then. You don't know her, she's nuts. Fuck. You're in the shit. Have a chip. - Serious? - To each his problems. I'm fucked. - C'mon, it's gonna rain. - I'm in the shit. - Hurry up! - I'm coming! Seriously? Are you crazy? I couldn't say you were here. She'd have flipped. Where's Didier? He went to Japan. Japan? My son is in Japan! That's fabulous. You're wacko. I know nothing about Japan. Delivering sushi has made your brain go soft. How are classes going? - What classes? - Accounting classes. Cool, no problem. There anything else? No. I was just thinking that... I'm pissed off you're here. Don't worry, it's like home. Only without your dirty socks or dishes to wash. It's a vacation. Bastard. I wanted to tell you that... Don't apologize. You're my bro. Don't apologize. - I brought you something. - Oh yeah? A babe in a bikini? Look, it'll help you. How long do I have to decide? I see. OK. We'll talk soon. Thank you. Have a good night. We need to rehearse! This is staccato. Go on, answer. Don't worry, it's nothing. Hang on a second. Do you understand the words? What does "godiamo" mean? It means "enjoyment." Alright? Enjoyment. So for pity's sake, enjoy yourselves! Come on! That's good. There we go. Now that's a real duet. Antoine? Yeah? Would you like to sing together at a reception tonight? It would really make me happy. Sure. But I need to change first. Sushi! - What now? - Leo wants some dope. - I bet you can score. - First off, don't touch me. I'm not your friend, stay away. And for the last time, my name is Antoine Zerkaoui. Sushi's the cold wet thing between your legs. Are we clear? Let's go. He's nuts. When I get home, I'm gonna rape him. Sergeant Thamié means business. Ditto. What about you? What about me? Got a guy waiting? No, not at all. I recognize a "no" like that. Don't wait too long, you might be sorry. I like my hair, so shut up. It looks like BBQ coals. Fuck off, asshole. No, you look cute. Hey, handsome! Where you going? No way, is he wearing perfume? You gonna score? We know her? - Maybe. - Let's see her Snap. Out of curiosity. - Sure. - Serious? Yeah. Hey, we're bros. Let's go! - Go on. - M-O... M-M-Y. "Mommy"? - Dirty bum. - Give her a kiss from me. He shamed you bad. Turn the sound down. Nice joint. Do you mind if we quicken the tempo? No, no problem. Wait for me here. - I'll be right back. - Sure. Antoine? This is Mr. Moreau, your teacher. Sorry, I can't hear you. I haven't seen you in class for several weeks now. It's a pity, we're moving on to Expense Accounts "68" and so... - Hello? - You keep cutting out. Sorry, bye. Doesn't he have a signal? Excuse me, you can't sit here. Sorry, I didn't know the chair was fragile. It's not. But it's for the guests. - Guests? - Diane, he's with me. Hello, Josephine. Come with me. - You know her? - She's my stepmother. Is this your place? No, it's my dad's and stepmom's. And I wish she'd drop dead. No way. - They got a private theatre? - Of course. Here. There's a changing room in the back. You kidding me? Bravo! Magnificent! Splendid! Bravo, my girl! Splendid! Bravo, my girl! You were perfect. Perfect! See you in a minute, sweetheart. Everybody, let's return to the salon. You OK? You for real? You treated me like a fucking clown. Your dad couldn't give a... What'd he sell me this time? His ass is dead. Mom How are you, son? Great, Mom. Japan is amazing. Really beautiful. Really. What's that peak? That one? It's the view from my room. Not bad, huh? - You doing well? - Great. I gotta go, it's late. There's a big time difference. But it's daylight behind you! Didier, c'mon! That's because... the sun sets much later. Everything's different here. I'll explain when I'm back. Love you, Mom! You coming or not? Who's talking during my phone call! I told you to talk Japanese! - I don't talk Japanese. - Fuck you! Japanese! - Come on down! - "Konichuwa" or whatever! Japanese. Antoine? Samia! What are you doing here? I'm on leave. Wanted to surprise you. It worked. - You look happy to see me. - I am. - But I can't stay. - Antoine! We'll be late. Josephine, this is Samia. An old friend. Pleased to meet you. We should get together! You can tell me all about him. He's so secretive. Sure, another time. I wouldn't want you to be late. Thank you. C'mon, let's go. - Coming? - Yes. See you soon! ELIO: When do we rehearse for the battle? You need to learn to read music. You're all on stage, like this. There are steps. Start with the text. I'm done with this. Just kidding. What's wrong with you? A case of constipation. Thank you, Maxime. Antoine, do me a favor. Leave commedia dell'arte to Italians and focus on technique. If technique is not the vector of emotion, you're an amateur. Maxime, review the 4th phrase. The rest was good. Candice? Come here. Sing the piece we worked on the other day. Give me a "do." Let's go. Try looking at someone. You swivel your head like a pigeon. - You looking for crumbs? - Shut up. Relax, I'm giving you some advice. You know what? Caruso looked at his wife when he sang. If she wasn't there... he was lost. - Try with her. - What's your trip? Since when do you want to help me? You jealous? Something wrong, Antoine? Where you traveling this time? Japan, but a new season. It's not winter, it'll look weird. Not here, but maybe there. Japan isn't the southern hemisphere, so it's like here. You idiot. They're six hours ahead of us. Time difference and seasons are two distinct things. Different time, same season. You see? So you need a new poster. One with no snow. That's all I got. What happens when my mom calls? Your lawyer's here. - Want him to split? - She's gonna call. - Want him to leave? - No, I'm coming. I don't get your hemispheres. Gotta know geography to go to jail? Anyone got a poster of Japan in Spring? Look up your ass! Better stay in here, cause when I get out I'll snuff you. - What's the problem? - What problem? You don't answer the phone or rehearse. - Have I done something? - No. - Tell me if I have. - I said "no." I have too much going on. It's not against you. Text me, anything. Don't get all pissed off. Sorry, habibi. We cool? You ate the whole bowl of M&Ms. It's not there for decoration. - You're a glutton. - No, you are. - Did you listen to the music? - Yeah. - Dig it? - Yeah. - Serious? - Yeah. I knew you would. Djamel said the Picasso punks got a new boy and he's hot. You with me or not? Cause otherwise... - I've understood, chill. - Me? How's things? Cool and you? Ah, I see! She's pissed. Did she talk to you? - Wanna know? - Yeah. You ignored her cause of a babe. That's all? That's all? That's not enough? You didn't even tell me. I'm taking my time. You want a wedding invitation? Yes. Whatever, but say something. Now I know why you're always so busy. - She got any girlfriends? - Lots. You'd die. What's she like? Show me a pic. - Not yet. - C'mon, show me! Show me! Shut up, they're coming. I don't believe you! Hang on, I got a surprise too. Fucking hell, brah. What're you doing here? Got out on a procedural error. Fuck, man. - Glad to see me? - You shoulda told me. - I'd have picked you up. - Don't worry. Hey, everybody! Tonight is Abdel's night. But before you're trashed, hear me out. You're on the run? Look out for the pigs. Thanks for your support while I was "on vacation." It warmed my heart. You're family. My bruh is gonna defend the hood with his flow. You defended us just fine last time with your fists. We don't all have the same talents. Bro, we're with you. - Give it your all, we'll be proud. - Thanks. - Thanks. - Happy Birthday, my friend. Did I put the heat on? I gotta play nasty now. You better cook. I'll try. - Give your brother a hug. - Good to see ya. Samia. Samia! Hey, stop sulking. I'm sorry for the other day. - Really, but... - But what? Are you jealous or what? Jealous? Who do you think I am? You're clueless. What hurts are your lies. - You want the truth? - Go ahead. Look, I'm studying opera and no one knows. Now you know. You didn't find anything better? You kidding me? OK. Go on, sing. Go on, I'm listening. Go on. You were right... - You're a shit liar. - Get lost. You think you're my girl? No, I'm just an old friend. Like you told that girl. - What's up, brah? - Nothing. We're waiting for you. It's Abdel's birthday! So... It's a famous repertory piece. You'll need to make it yours. But Antoine, no commedia dell'arte! Antoine? - Are you listening? - Yes. You seem elsewhere. Sometimes I think I never should've delivered your order. Cause... ever since that day, my life has fallen apart. Things were simpler before. Oh really? Simplicity is the path to fulfillment? I don't know... but I can't find my place. As a child, I never imagined I'd be an opera singer. My mother refused. She wanted a boy, anyhow. She never held me in her arms. And my father was a coward. Don't worry, I wasn't abused. But the essential was missing. Love. And one day, a high school teacher took our class to the opera. And I was submerged by love. It was everywhere. The composer's love for his music. The characters' love for each other. The singers' love of singing. The audience's love for them. That night, I didn't go home. And then? And then? I never went home again. Don't you miss your family? This opera house is my family. It welcomed me with open arms. As if it'd been waiting for me. I'm sorry, your story is very beautiful... but things aren't so clear for me. Are you maybe spreading yourself too thin? You can't even focus anymore. Were you out late last night? Why? You look awful. You like to party too. - Oh yes? - You didn't shut an eye. Giving advice is easy, but... Are you OK? Yes. It's nothing. - You need anything? - I'm fine. I'll see you in class tomorrow. The year-end audition is soon. As you know, it draws the world's most prestigious opera directors. For each of you, this audition is a unique opportunity to make a living from your passion. I hope you chose the right piece. I'm counting on you to hold high the Atelier's image of excellence. I say it again, this is a unique opportunity. Grab it. Antoine! Antoine! Sorry. - Are you with us? - Yes. Get with the program or you'll be lost. "Employment" equals... "Re..." - "Resources"? - Yes! - You didn't cheat, right? - No. Any questions? - Hey, Franck, I'm late. - Hi, Antoine. You know him? Living proof of the opera's magic. He delivered sushi... Now he sings here. You interested? No, that's OK. Hey. You're playing with fire. I came as fast as I could. Good, Maxime. A tad more fluid and our house will welcome a new singer. Bravo. Go sit down. Antoine honors us with his presence, so let's call him up. Hello. Did you work on the end? Nathalie, the start of measure 42. Let's go. Antoine... when you arrive, you must be ready to sing. We're not interested in your vocal warmups. So pull yourself together. Otherwise, I'm far happier at home. I'm sorry. Go on. Antoine. Vincerò! Vincerò! is not easy but we've been over this. Build up gradually, remember? And focus on your breathing. Take a deep breath. Breathe. No! Not here! What's with your neck? Have you forgotten everything? Sorry. I'm sorry, it'll pass. One more time. Stop. You're forcing. Stop. Stop, Antoine! Leave me alone. Who do you think you are? You show up late and give me orders? Chill, let me show you. Trust me. You'll break your voice. - Sit down. - You won't let me sing? - Nathalie, go on. - No. William. Come here. Go on. I got no business here. Who's she talking to? Shit classes. I swear she breaks my balls. Hey, Antoine! This is Ryad. Production manager of Hyper Focal. Ryad, Antoine. Your pal said tonight's your night. I dunno, maybe. He needs to concentrate. - He's got a problem. - No, he's cool. - Some candy? - I didn't come to eat. You've found the best club. DJ. Hey. Gonna sing some opera? I'm in the news, don't got no blues Who's on the hustle now? This is Antoine. He's joining our class today. You think I could express... Emotion? You forgot everything! Don't apologize. You're my bro. I'm studying opera and no one knows. You were right... You're a shit liar. I can't find my place. You see this nigga... Look at him, pretends he's got a trigga You know what? He studies opera! Antoine! Get lost! Antoine! - Is it true? - Why do you fucking care? You show respect by lying? What'll people say? Don't give me shit. You know nothing about my life! How can I? All you do is lie. - Want the truth? - Yeah. I don't give a shit about accounting! Or your gang rivalry. You don't get it. I'm me, that's all. You don't like it, too bad. You want the truth? I want to be an opera singer. Opera? Look where we come from. - They messed with you. - You're too dumb to get it. Who the fuck are you? Not my fault your life sucks! You play boss but you're no one. You see that? That was for you. When Dad left, I spent my life watching out for you. You're my brother and family is sacred. Everything I do is for you! Everything! But you lied and made a fool of me. You shit on me, Mom, the whole neighborhood. You know what? I'm done. Do what you want, this is no longer your home. Get lost. Yeah, run away. Run away, that's family. Help me up, bro. - Who's there? - Antoine. Cool, come up. I have people for you to meet. Antoine? Are you there? Hello. Ma'am, it's Antoine. I know it's late, I just wanted to say that... Hello? Shit. They call it the "house." But you can't sleep here. Look, dude. This isn't the moment, please. Another one of Miss Olchewsky's martyrs. Why's that? Let me show you something. - It'll get your mind off things. - Wait a sec! You're the Phantom of the Opera. Just a perk when your dad's a big donor. I love it here. It might even be what made me want to sing here. Do you know why you're here? I don't know much at all. Why are you being so nice to me? There's a saying: "If your enemy is hungry, give him food." I want my victory with you onstage at your best. Come to my place. Can't sleep here. Thanks. Don't thank me, my plan is to dissolve you in acid. Go on, I'm coming. Leave me a message! Hello, Madam Loyseau. I just wanted to thank you for everything. Please accept my apologies. That's all. Good night. ANTOINE: Voicemail Message Antoine? Singing Audition Wednesday, June 15th, 2022 at 9 PM Marie... give it some more thought. I have, Pierre. I refuse to carry out a battle, whose end we both know only too well. Then think of your family. My family? You know my family. It's yours. It's this opera house. I don't want to give up my hair, or the delights of a Château Latour 2010, for a few extra weeks. What will you do? Enjoy the time I have left. Listen to my favorite arias. Savor... every last drop of this wine. And I'll look out this window. Even if it's growing smaller. Surimi? Surimi? Surimi is life, brah. She's late again. She'd be late for the end of the world. There she is. Hey, girl. You're late, General. What? She's not coming back cause of me? You give yourself too much importance. I hope she made the right choice. Here. This is for you. Gather round. As you know, Madam Loyseau had to advance her... her trip to Seoul. You'll have to get by alone. This is it. I hope that your training here and the woman who coached you will stay with you. Come on, it's your turn next. - You alright? - Yeah, sure. Thanks. Break a leg. Antoine... I'm writing because I won't be by your side at the audition. You know... I believe in destiny. And destiny put me on your path the day we met. Your voice brought back my first emotions at the Opera. There she is. Hey, girl. You're late, General. If I believed in God, I would say, like him, I want to see you touch the stars. But I only believe in the now. As for the stars, I'm closer than you. For destiny has other plans for me. I didn't have children, but I brought to life talent, careers, art, and beauty. And the light I saw in you, Antoine... gave me much joy. Excuse me. - You know where Didier is? - Nope. I know. Try not to be angry. Most people never live their lives and you're very lucky. You're afraid that you're not in your place. But you have the spark, all you need is to believe in yourself. Never forget that the day we met, you followed me. Never forget all those classes where you never gave up. You were my last student and the last beautiful gift that life gave me. Love is immense and you never know where a sushi delivery can take you! C'mon, let's go. Hurry up! Believe me, Antoine... you are truly in your place. One last thing. You were right... 2Pac rocks. Take care of yourself. To Julien... For Micha...
