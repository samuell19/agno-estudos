We're approaching the insertion target area, about a mile from your DZ. You ready, WD-40? I never felt more ready in my life. Oh, man! Watch out! Steele, you crazy fool! What are you trying to do, man? Alex Trebek on speaker: Good afternoon, WD-40. We now begin the Free Worlds in Double Jeopardy round of your mission. He's a sadistic criminal mastermind and international arms dealer who has brokered a deal to sell a stolen Scorpion missile to a Middle Eastern terrorist cell. The question is who is Rancor? That's right, General Durwood Rancor. So why don't you begin your mission, and good luck to you, WD-40. And don't forget, WD-40, as always, this tape will self-destruct in three seconds. [beeping] Steele! [alarm blaring] General Rancor, your chopper is waiting. Fine. Be there in a minute. I ain't done with this one yet. - [blows landing] - Talk to me, boy. He doesn't want to talk. Take him outside and shoot him. And when you shoot him, use the silencer. [muffled gunshot] Thank you. Have a nice flight. Have a great flight. - Enjoy destroying the world, sir. - Thank you, ma'am. I will. I'm going in there. My God, look at you. You are such an incredible man. It's my job, darling. I do it for my country. Hmm? Oh! Good luck. [chuckles] Luck's got nothing to do with it. [bones crunch] [fabric rips] [beeping] [Rancor laughs] Nothing can stop me now, not even that sanctimonious secret agent Boy Scout Dick... WD-40: Yoohoo! [laughs] ...Steele? Aah! - Dick! Don't drop me, Dick! - Hold on! Don't-- Grab my wrist! [groans] Whoa! Don't-- Don't drop me. Aah!

Rancor: Well, what is it? Oh, it's this really neat security system, sir. It picks up the body heat on the intruders-- Fine. What is it detecting? Oh, it looks like Agent Barbara Dahl, sir. Barbara Dahl? Hot damn. At last. Arm me. Yeah. Now, bring me the bait. [deep voice] Welcome, Miss Dahl. General Rancor would like to see you. Don't even think about it! Put the gun down! [deep voice] Move! Don't try anything funny. - Man: Watch it! - Barbara: Ow, you morons! Let go! Ouch! Well, look at you. Barbara Dahl. If you ain't the spitting image of your mama. Don't you talk about my mother, you-- you hybrid curiosity. My mother was twice the man you are. Hey, lady, I think you're carrying this spitting image thing a little bit too far. Now that I got Barbara Dahl, it's just a matter of time before Dick Steele comes to get her. [laughter continues] Have you, uh, confirmed this transmission? I have. It's confirmed. It's Barbara Dahl. Who authorized Agent Barbara Dahl to go on this operation anyway? No one. - She's working on her own. - Wha-- This one is personal, Coleman. Well, this personal mission may have cost a good agent her life and put the entire free world in jeopardy. We must inform the director! [beep] Director on speaker: This is the director. What is it, Coleman and Bishop? Sir, we've intercepted a very disturbing satellite transmission from our listening post on the Rock of Gibraltar. Well, what is it? It's this really big rock sticking out of the water there on the south coast of Spain. [speaking through phone] What is the transmission? You have to see it to believe it, sir. You've got to put it on channel three. No, four. Switch it to VHS. And take it off of cable. Put it on the monitor. Announcer: And now, this special message from Rancor Industries. She makes a pretty hood ornament, don't you think? Rancor! Yes, it is I, good old General Rancor. I'm back, big as life and twice as ugly. But Steele blew him up. Apparently not. You did everything except eat me and I'm still alive. All Steele did was blow off a couple of arms. That's no biggie, no big thing. Now I've got plenty of arms, big arms, pretty arms... I got arms up the wazoo. Now let me show you something. Your pretty little agent is now part of the nose cone on top of my missile. This missile will be launched in 36 hours, and nothing will stop me. He's a madman. Only thing is, I'm missing one little chip that controls my satellite, and daggone, I want it back. Now you hand me my chip, I'll give you back your agent. Good God. He must be stopped! Dick Steele couldn't stop me 15 years ago, and all the dicks you've got won't stop me now. Apparently he hasn't seen the size of some of our newer members. - [tragic violin music playing] - With the chip, he rules the world. Without the chip, he destroys the world, and-- Would you practice someplace else? I'm trying to think! - [playing "Dixieland"] - The world. Ha! We all know what General Rancor really wants. Steele. That's right, and we're going to give Steele to him. Steele? Have you forgotten what happened the last time Steele was placed in the line of fire? Coleman: We are, uh, stopping here. Traveller wants to mingle with the crowd. [cork pops] [packaging pops] [bubbles pop] [popping continues] Coleman: Steele, what the hell are you doing? Traveller: Get off me! Coleman: Get him in there! Get him in the limo! Cover him! Get him in the limo! Get in the car! Go, go, go, go! Go, go! Man on PA: The bridge is out. Do not enter. The bridge is out. Coleman: The bridge is out! The bridge is out, damn it! Stop this car! [shoes screeching] Stay away from the window, sir. Steele, do something! Good job, Steele! Thanks! Coleman: It's about time that jerk did something right. - Whoa! - Coleman: Hang on, Mr. President. The bridge is out. Do not enter. Thank God our president was one hell of a good swimmer. Nonetheless, there's only one man for this operation. Agent WD-40-- Steele, Dick Steele. Woman: Dick, Dick, Dick Steele. Oh, Dick. Oh, Dick, that was incredible. Thank you. Don't thank me, darling. The art of lovemaking takes two. Sometimes three or four, depending how well you do at the crap tables. Fore! Well, my putter's up. Oh, Dick, I'm exhausted. You are insatiable. 15 minutes to tee off time. Darling, I think there's something you and I should talk about openly and honestly before I head off to my golf game. What is it, Dick? It's a game. People dress funny, hit a little ball with clubs. Drinking is involved. Is something wrong, Dick? Well, whatever we've had between us, I think it's only fair that you know that my heart still belongs to the girl I fell in love with years ago-- Victoria. She fell off a cliff. She died? Yes, I know. I was just getting to that. But after Victoria Dahl, well, I don't think I'll ever find room for another woman in this ripped apart, torn-up, scarred, burned-out lump in my chest where a human heart once beat. I hope you understand what I'm trying to say to you. [bad Russian accent] Oh, I live, Mr. Steele. It's your life I'm worried about. I'm glad you understand. Aah! I know how much these things can hurt. Man: Steele. Woman: Hi, Dick! - Hi, Mr. Steele. - Good morning, Mrs. Huggermugger. - Man: Fore! - Watch out! You all right? Thank you. Man: A little help, please? Thank you! Man on PA: Dinitaly foursome to starter's window. Mr. Jack Dinitaly to... - Man: Duck! - [glass breaks] [woman screams] Dick, wait. Steve! Steve Bishop. You look great. Thank you. We go back a long way, huh? Yeah. - Let's have a drink. - Okay. Sit right there, Steve. - The usual, Mr. Steele? - You betcha. Well, how's everything at the agency? Eh, Dick, is used to be such fun killing a few spies with gas from a banana grenade. But now it's all bureaucratic politics. You got to fill out 20 forms in triplicate just to take a piss! - [grunting] - [bones crack] - Boy, that was fun. - Yeah. Thank you. They don't do stuff like that at the agency anymore. Well, I'm sorry to hear that, Steve. Dicky, there is something. Steve, I'm out of the service. There's a plot to launch a satellite. No, I'm out of the service. Talk about something else. - [phone rings] - Man: Bishop? - Bishop here. - We got a new lead. - Ah. - Gonna need you here. - Yeah. - And get a dozen eggs. - Okay. - And a gallon of milk. - I'll leave right away. - Thank you, sir. Eh, no more headsets, ear buttons. They put the receiver right in your head now. - Woman: If you'd like to make a call... - I got to get back to the hotel. The director wants you to see this. Not interested, Steve. Please, Dicky, take a look at the tape. It'll change your mind. She makes a pretty hood ornament, don't you think? Yes, it is I, good old General Rancor. I'm back, big as life, and twice as ugly. All Steele did was blow off a couple arms... Rancor. He can't be alive. My God. Barbara Dahl. Victoria, why would your daughter join the agency knowing what happened to you? Why? Why? Why, why, why, why?

Kelly Lang here for Channel 3 island news. A tragic accident has claimed the life of a businessman identified as Steven Bishop when a huge grand piano fell from the 17th floor of the Mayan Hotel directly behind me - and landed on his car. - An accident? Having a kid at 60, that's an accident. Having a piano fall on you, that's bad luck. Woman: Operator. Operator, get me Washington. George? D.C. I'll take care of the luggage. Just some overnight things. [tires screech, car crashes] Woman: Bonjour, monsieur. It looks like you could use a hand. I'm afraid I'm pretty clumsy. You must headed to Los Angeles. How'd you know that? It's written on your ticket. Oh, thank you. You're welcome. Have a nice flight and I wish you adieu. Oh, thank you, but I'm quite satisfied with the dew I have. If you want to see me again, turn around now. Ah-ha. No, no, no. I asked for a window seat. I can't be getting up and down just because somebody wants to be getting in and out. I have too much to do. I always have a window seat. Excuse me, sir. I was wondering-- Do you mind? No problem. Please, be my guest. Actually, I prefer and aisle seat. Excuse me. By my guest. Sure, let me help you with these. I hope that this will be the last of the conversations on this trip. Your ticket. [cat yowls] - [cat yowls, glass breaks] - Take it easy with that luggage. [glass breaks, cat yowls] Excuse me, sir, could you put your tray table up for take-off please? No, the tray table stays down, please. Thank you very much. You've made things inconvenient enough as it is. What-- What is this? - [baby crying] - Is this yours? Do you mind? It's my briefcase. Let me make more room for you. Ooh! Aah! Steele: Excuse me, is this seat taken? - Please. - Thank you. Do you always take matters into your own hands? Things often end up in my hands. And I bet your hands end up in a lot of things. Let's just say my hands and things are often in the same place at the same time. Could I get you something to drink? We'll have dry Minolli and Russos on the rocks, stirred, not beaten, twist of lemon, in chilled glasses, not frozen, and two of those curly little straws. [growls] Countdown voice: 30 hours, 11 minutes, and 10 seconds. 30 hours, 11 minutes, and eight seconds. 30 hours, 11 minutes, and five seconds. [dogs barking] Director: Miss Cheevus, when Agent Steele arrives, send him right in. Mm-hmm? Miss Cheevus, is the director available? No, he's married. Oh, you kidder. Miss Cheevus, you wouldn't be trying to make things hard for me? Oh, Dick, if only I could. But you know, you and I would work so well together deep undercover. You know the agency's rules about secrecy. They're very rigid. Yes, and we wouldn't want to blow it, would we? [buzzer] Why don't you two just get a motel room? I need you in here now, Steele. Uh, Miss Cheevus, wasn't the director in the office here? He just buzzed me from in there, my little pumpy-wumpy. We'll, I'll just sit down and wait for him. [farting] [stomach grumbles] [continues farting] Great Scott! Steele, see a doctor! Good show, Steele. I hid for two week's from my ex-wife's attorney in this outfit. Good to see you, WD-40. You were always my most noble warrior. Glad to find you, sir. Yes, yes, well, we have to find someone else far more important right now. You saw the tape with Rancor? I can't believe he's alive. He's a madman. He wants the world. But I'll be perfectly frank, Dick, he wants you first. He knew I'd send you the tape, especially with Barbara Dahl on it. Steele narrating: Barbara Dahl... looks just like Victoria when she was alive. We don't have time for flashbacks. Rancor wants the world. Fortunately, he wants to kill you first. That may give us needed time. Barbara Dahl's last transmission was from Los Angeles. We couldn't hold a trace long enough to pinpoint her. Find her, you find him, you find the rocket. For the rest of it, your guess is as good as mine. Miss Cheevus, tell Noggin we're coming. - Hello, Noggin. - Steele. It's good to see you again. Oh, do you have a refill of that death ray laser watch? Ah, new air freshener? Careful! Woo-hoo! Hey! Not again! Aah! Well, this looks like a clever contraption. A mini, uh-- a mini-mobile crime lab? - It's a briefcase. - I know. What does it do? It holds important papers, files, pens, and a calculator. I understand, but these numbers here, in a certain sequence, the briefcase is timed to explode? No, it's a lock so people other than myself can't open my briefcase. Very complex. A contemporary technology. All right, Steele, this is your standard state-of-the-art G-7 field kit with three additions. This is our latest development-- microchip z-ray lenses capable of penetrating a layer of clothing. You'll be able to see if an enemy is carrying a weapon. Uh, director? Oh, now, Steele, should you find your hands bound, what you can do is just reach down and pull this pin with your teeth... Put the tube in your mouth and you squeeze and it will emit a laser beam powerful enough to cut steel. Noggin: Fire in the hole, director. Thank you. Oh, and one more thing, this micro-detonator has a built in timer set to explode 30 seconds after you plant it. It has enough power to blow up a two-story building, so be careful. Fantastic. All right, well, here we go, and uh... Oh, yes. Thank you. Good to see you again, Noggin. Woman on PA: Bienvenidos a Los Angeles. Man on PA: Welcome to Los Angeles. Woman: Ciudad de Los Angeles. Man: City of the angels. Woman: ¿Donde está Maria? Man: Where is Maria? Woman: Maria está en la biblioteca. Man: Maria is in the library. Do you have a lighter? I use matches. Does your mother know you smoke? Yes, but I don't inhale. Kabul. Uh... I'm Kabul. Agent WD-40? Phew! Get in! In the car! Kabul: Hello! Excuse me! Our operatives believe you may already be in grave danger. Please take a look at this Mr. Steele. In that file is Desiree More. She's expert trained in karate, kung-fu, and is a crack shot. Be on your guard. Rancor may have sent her to take you out. She likes easy listening and guys who share their feelings. Her measurements-- 36, 24, 36, 22. Ay, for God's sakes, be careful, WD-40. One time I had two cousins that got salmonella poisoning at this hotel. Oh, dear! Sassafras! Steele narrating: Sure looked like her. But you can't be too sure. Yeah, almost positive. Mm-hmm. Drink? Only when I'm thirsty. Tap water okay? Poured, not decantered. Sometimes you see a woman you'd just love to have kill you. But timing is everything so that was not going to be today. Says who? She's pretty smart. I decided to play it casual. Casual's overrated. Oops. I think the game is over, Mr. Steele. You're going to look like Swiss cheese when they find you. Oh, that's no Gouda. Wai-ooo! Hoo! Waiii-ya! [thud] - [shouting continues] - [knock on door] Oww! "Coca Cabana". I'll be back for you. Where are you going? In my country, we have a saying. A man who rides a camel is rich, but a man who drives a Ferrari can get lucky! - [honking horn] - Aah! Oh, gee, I am so sorry. What's your phone number? - Loser. - Oh, thank you. Like, look at what you've done. End of the line, pal. Uh... [bullet ricochets] Hey, goomba. Huh? Well, well, if it isn't Agent Steele. Excuse me, do you have a light? Yeah, sure. I got a light. Very good. Well, remind me never to light your cigarette. You don't lose guys like that for long. Let's get the bus. We'll be safe there. Transfer? Uh, no thank you. Nice dress. Next stop, Sunset Boulevard! I guess it's Sunset Boulevard. Pop quiz, hotshot. Someone on the bus is out of transfers, he won't the fare! What do you do? What do you do? Stop the bus and let him off? Negatory, honcho, because he cut the brake line! Excuse-moi, monsieur. Whoa! Aah! Oh! Thank you, thank you. Next stop, Melrose... I think. Well, you must be "fam-eeshed". Let's "munch-ay". That sounds good, but I'm hungry. Let's eat first. Here you go. Enjoy yourselves. Brian will be right here to take your drink order. We've shared an airplane, a drink, we have been chased, bussed through city, but I still don't really know you. I'm Bud Fuddlacker. I have a small mail-order business. I travel with the American Gladiators. I'm 55, I like small appliances, and I do tax accounting on the side. Let me guess. You are Dick Steele, Agent WD-40 with the Secret Service. You're 52, you like big screen TVs, and you want to stop General Rancor. That could describe a thousand guys. Tell me about you. Well, I like loose-fitting clothes and I drive a '69 Pinto. Hi, I'm Brian. May I take your drink orders please? I'll have-- A dry Minolli and Russo on the rocks, stirred, not beaten, with a twist, in a chilled glass, not frozen with two of those girly little straws. Be right back. Tell me, who are you? Why don't you use your legendary skills and guess? You carry a UB-21 Schnauzer with a knob silencer-- that's KGB. You prefer an H&K over the AK, your surveillance technique is NSA, ID is CIA. You received your Ph.D. at NYU, traded in your GTO for a BMW. You listen to CDs by REM and STP. And you'd like to see JFK in his BVDs getting down with OPP. And you probably put the toilet paper back on the roll with the paper on the inside. Here's to your remarkable powers of observation, Mr. Steele. I am Agent 3.14-- Veronique Ukrinsky. My father is a professor. Ah, yes. I know. The megachip. When he found out he was making the chip for Rancor and not for the US, he escaped with it and he is in hiding. In hiding. Where? He would not take the chance to tell me where he was headed, but he said the pendant... "Follow the path of your pendant to find me." Hmm. Haven't seen too many like these. "Pendant." Pendant. - Pendant. - Pendant. Pendant. We don't have much time, WD-40. Sooner or later, Rancor will find him. I'll order our food to go. Oh, Dick, I am so worried about my father.

I got an idea. This is a picture of my father. If we get separated, find him. Save him. [thudding] Why? Go. Go, go! Go! - Shut up. - I came here to dance! Veronique: Dick, help me! Help! - I'll kill you. - Get in! No, let me go! - Man: Okay, let's go! - Veronique: Dick! Help me! Veronique: Follow the path of your pendant to find me. Kabul: What is that? It's a pendant. "Follow the path of the pendant to find me." Have you ever seen anything like that? - Ahh. - What? What? No. Any idea where it came from? Museum of Natural History. How do you know that? It says it really small right there at the bottom. All right, take me to the Museum of Natural History. You know, in my country, we do have a saying-- I'm sure you do. The saying goes, "The museum is closed at 5:00. You got the next morning at 9:00." Excuse me, Mr. Pushy. Son of a bitch. [mumbling] I'm getting sick and tired of your-- No, he'd never fit in there. Yep! God! I'm sick and tired of these games. Coleman: This is stupid. We're a government agency for God's sakes. Huh? Ha! Eh, what-- Good God! You're sicker than I thought. What is it, Coleman? I'm busy. I can see that. You wouldn't understand. It's the ancient art of ornagatzi. What I don't understand is your insistence in keeping Steele on this assignment! He still is no closer to Rancor and we have who knows how little time left before Rancor launches this satellite. You'd better let me take over this search before I-- Director: Before you what, Coleman? I don't know who's monkey you spanked to get this job, but as far as I'm concerned, you're a disgrace to the service. How dare you? You and your one for all and all for one bleeding heart nonsense, you're too old to run this agency! And since you won't step down, you'll be stepped on. Ha! Loser! What you got? Is there a jewelry district in Los Angeles? Oh, come on, this is Hollywood. We have jewelry, we have women who are willing to sleep for-- More importantly, is their a Russian jewelry section? Da. - Where? - I don't know. But there used to be a bunch of Russian jewelers who hung out at the warehouse at, uh, at 31st and Phlegm. Ah, damn it. Meet me back at the hotel. We'll split up. - Accident. - Thank you. Oh, excuse me! Get off! [man yells in Spanish] Hi-yah! [crunch] [grunting] Aah! Watch it! Watch it! Hi-ho! Aah! Cheerio. [horse neighs] [horse urinating] [urination continues] Both: Hmm. [urination stops] You're mine, Steele! Whoa! Wh-wh-whoa! Horse: Whoa! Aah! Man: Okay, bring it up! Bring it up! Up, up, up! Okay, that's where the sign goes! Kabul: Ah, 31st and Phlegm. I'm on the waiting list for a co-op. You better get out of here. I'll see you back in a half an hour. Oh, a half hour? I can drop off my dog at the groomer. - [horn honks] - [car crashes] What? Mr. Steele, I presume? Professor... Ukrinsky, with a "Y". Ah. Right. The pendant. And I suppose this is what you need. And this is? This is the controller chip for Rancor's satellite. Ah, Rancor finally made his megachip. Who would have thought the fate of so many human lives would lie in something so small? Well, there's only one thing to do with this. Oh, no! [thud] What are you doing? Trying to make the world safe from tyranny. You mustn't do that! This can also be used for world peace! Oh, I'm sorry. You'd better let me get that into the proper hands and get you to safety. You found me through my daughter, the pendant. - Right. - And Veronique is safe? Yeah, the van they took her in has dual airbags and seatbelts. Kabul. Nice new wheels, huh? Yeah, quite an improvement. In the back, professor. We have to find a safe place for the professor. In my country, we have a saying, "The rabbit hops, the spider crawls, "but the camel spits." Let's see if this Charger can run. Now, I don't want you to be surprised. This guy is one of our top agents. He's most capable. Aah! McCluckey! Kabul! Hey, hey! - Come on in. - All right. Come on. McCluckey, we need to hide the professor. Professor Ukrinsky, it's an honor. - How do you do? - I've read all your work, and your last paper on laboratory loneliness? Superb! Well, thank you. McCluckey, I'd like you to meet Agent-- Dick Steele, Agent WD-40. Good to see you back in action. Your video on deception-- "Is It A Woman? Is The Mustache Real?" Beautiful work. Thank you. McCluckey, we need to hide this guy. Sure, sure. Come this way. He'll be safe here. You have a telephone? Right over there. Is it clean? I have a woman that comes in once a week. - [buzzer] - Miss Cheevus: Sir? What? I have Dick "Luscious Lips" Steele on the line. Put him through. Steele: Director, is it safe? Director: Safe? Just a minute. I'll use the cloaking device. Go ahead, Dick. It's safe. I have the chip Rancor needs to launch his satellite. Director: Good, Dick. Good. Are you coming in? No, Rancor kidnapped the professor's daughter. I've got to find her. Director: Yes, well, good, Dick. Good luck. Call me if I can help. Countdown voice: 19 hours and 35 minutes... That Steele's going to be sorry his mama ever met his papa. We going to heat up the fire! Boys! They always seem to know every move we make. It's inside. It's got to be somebody inside leaking. Well, I'm not leaking. I can prove it. - You go ahead. Ask me something. - What? Ask me something. Ask me who's the director of our agency? Who's the director of our agency? I don't know. You see, I know who it is, you see, but I'm not going to tell you, you see? Because I am no leak! This place has got to be a front for Rancor and his men. There's one of them now. Follow him. [engine revs] Do you have to keep revving the engine? But it's an American V-8. Such a beautiful sound! [engine revs] Steele, listen to this. My cousin's a recording star. [Middle-Eastern music plays on stereo] - Duck - Ow! - Ooh! - Oh. [music continues] Mm-hmm. Hmm. Kabul: Did he see us? Okay. [music shuts off] - I'm going in there. - Okay. - Give me cover. - Got to buy my lottery ticket. - Rancor's guy is here. - Right. ♪ ...a wretch like me ♪ ♪ I once was lost, but now am found ♪ ♪ Was blind-- ♪ What are you doing here?

Code yellow! - Get me 3 CCs of ephenepinex. - Right away. Get me 2 liters of gasahol mixed with einephercine. On my way. - Get me an electro-statisfier now! - I'll warm up the generator.

They'll pay for this. Oh, Dick it was very... [Veronica stutters] Move 'em, fathead! Sisters, make 'em holy! Oh, Dick, you came for me. Tell me, what's been happening? Well, I've been doing a lot of soul searching, getting in touch with my inner child. I have decided I love you. But what about my father? Well, I like him, I just have to get to know him better. No, is he okay? Have you got his chip? Oh, no, he's fine, and I got the chip. - Oh, I love you, too. - [car horns honk] Look out, you crazy nun! Thanks Gods I stopped you. You could have been killed. Quick, let me help. You smell nice. Veronique: Where is my father? Is he safe? He's safe, Veronique. Safe as you and me. Kabul: So cute. Oh! Safer. Kabul: You know, in my country, when an irate, armless, psychotic weirdo chase your woman, you must hide her. Upstairs, apartment 5B. I'll wait downstairs. I'll keep my eyes open. I just put in new carpet. Take your shoes off. Oh, Dick, it's so nice to know that everything is going to be all right. You have the chip, my father's safe. You love me, Dick. Love? Let me tell you about love, Veronique. Love is a dewdrop on a rose petal. Love is drop of rain, pure and shimmering and trembling, so moist, so wet. And those tiny little drops of love come together, gathering up broken buds and fallen flowers and dirt and dung and deer droppings, flowing faster and faster outward to the sea, onward and onward-- Good night. We'll talk more in the morning. [chuckles] Hey, hotshots, come and get me! Why you little, no good juvenile delinquent! - Go on. - Come on! Cool. Man: Heads up! - Oh, nice shot! - Come on! I'm going. I'm going. We got you now. Where's the professor? With Gilligan, dickweed! Aah! [groans] No! This is for "Getting Even With Dad". And this is for "My Girl". And this is for "My Girl 2". I wasn't even in "My Girl 2"! Both: We don't care! Last time we're going to ask you, smart boy, where's the professor? Okay, okay, down the hall to the right. Okay, the left! Professor: Help! Somebody help me! They're taking us to Kikiree Island! [engines rev and tires squeal] They've taken him to Rancor. They won't kill him. Not until he's installed the chip. Probably not even then-- maybe just torture him a little. We'll talk about this on the way. Let's get to Kikiree. You like this disguise? It's very good. I'm proud of this one. Like this, I can look like anybody. Rancor Industries owns this little island. The natives say there are stranger goings-on here than at Neverland Valley Ranch. - Look. - Uh-huh. It's nice. Kabul, stay in the boat. Why? There's a saying in my country. When you hear the words "Stay in the boat", you stay in the boat. Bye-bye. [loud roar] Dick, this is crazy! Crazy? Some people think walking down the street muttering to yourself is crazy. I'll tell you what crazy is. Crazy is walking down the street with half a cantaloupe on your head saying "I'm a hamster." "I'm a hamster." That's crazy. Ooh! My life's work is now complete. Your cooperation is commendable, professor. Thank you. Throw him in the cell. But you said it was for the world peace! Rancor: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hello, General? It's Skippy. They're on the island. Ha ha, yeah. Well, well, well, what perfect timing. It seems we're going to have more guests. Steele's not dead. He's on his way here. Throw her in with the others! No, please! I thought you loved me! Nah, I was just using you. Countdown Voice: 7 hours, 59 minutes, and 41 seconds. 7 hours, 59 minutes, and 38 seconds. 7 hours, 59 minutes, and thirty... Whoa! Dick, look out! Got you now, Steele. Hey, where are you going? [both grunting] Man: Take that. Hey, come back here! Nowhere to go, Steele. How fast can you run, my friend? [roars] All right, men, tie him up. Okay, go ahead, kill me. I got a bomb. You touch me and you'll blow up yourself. You don't really think I'm going to fall for that old tied to the bomb trick, do you? Well, how about the old snake trick? Aah! [roars] [man screams] [loud growling] What is it? [swallowing, loud burp] Ehh! Let's go! Countdown Voice: 2 hours, 59 minutes, and 26 seconds to launch. 2 hours, 59 minutes, and 21 seconds to launch. 2 hours, 59 minutes, and 19 seconds to launch. Steele: We've got to find a way into Rancor's complex. - Are you ready? - Ready. Here, help me with this. How patriotic, Dick. - And deadly. - Oh, Dick. [grunting] Man: Bearing 177.5. On my Mark. Hi, Mark! Get set. - Father! - My child! Well, well, Dick Steele. I'd shake your hand, but I don't remember where it landed. Clever. Clever? Clever! Take their weapons. Mm-hmm. Throw her in with the others. Bind him. [mumbled conversations] - Dick Steele? - Oh, Miss Dahl. Barbara Dahl! Get your paws off me, you damn dirty ape! [beeps twice] No! No! You remember Barbara Dahl-- Victoria's daughter? I'd like to see you watch her go up like you watched her mother go down. But I'd rather let you just be a dessert for my little pet. [roars] What's left of you will have to watch helplessly while I play Mortal Kombat with the entire world. Ha ha ha! [men laugh] [Rancor continues laughing] Oh! [men shouting] It's going to blow! Hurry up! [beeps twice] [beeps twice] Barbara Dahl: Come on. Veronique: Come on, let's go. Dr. Joyce Brothers: You are very immature. Bullies tend to have very bad self-esteem. - Hi-yah! - Aah! - [gears clicking] - Ah-ha! Oh, ho! Leave me alone! I'm an unarmed man! - Aah! - [squeaking] [squeaks] Oh, Miss Cheevus. Dick, I'm sorry. [countdown continues over PA] Huh? You were under the influence of an evil man. It was still a lousy thing to do. Uh-oh. General, it's broken. Well, you'll like space. Lots of elbow room and, uh... Oh, whoops. Sorry. Countdown voice: 1 minute and 11 seconds. 1 minute and 10 seconds... [alarm blares] Yeah? You lose, Steele. That countdown is irreversible. Really? Steele: Well... We need to go. ...let's just see how irreversible that really is. It's irreversible, and there's nothing you patriotic pansies can do about it. Let me tell you what being patriotic really is, you scumbag poop. This a great country where a man can sue anyone he wants anytime he wants. It's a great country because thousands of people die every year from handguns, and yet at this very moment... Steele over PA: ...you can still walk into a convenience store anywhere and buy one of those guns. That's democracy in action... It's finally time somebody does what that fool Steele should have done, and it's going to be me. Let's go! ...anyone who's male, white, and filthy rich has the right to run for the office of the President. This is a great country because any moron-- All right, everyone, drop your guns! I'm, uh, taking over. Steele, get down from there. Countdown voice: 28, 27, 26... Dick, come on. We have to go! Now! Oh! Come on, come on! I wasn't finished. - Well, quick. - Hurry up. Just move it. - Come on, get out. - I'm coming. Coleman: Steele, always doing this to me! Countdown voice: 12... Rancor on PA: You'll see! I'm not through. I'll be back. Maybe just tissue or a brain. Open the doors! I'm stuck in here! I'm going up, but you and your whole world are going down! I'll be back. Maybe without legs or some other minor organ. Kabul: Wait, I don't want to miss the fireworks! Aah! Coleman: It's getting hotter. I'm telling you, it is getting very hot in here! How about a hand for General Rancor? You're not through with me! Aww. Well... Man: Uh, Houston, we have a problem.
