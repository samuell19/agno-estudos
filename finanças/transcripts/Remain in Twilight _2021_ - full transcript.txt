I can't see you. Yoshio, go right. Oh, that's too far. Go back left, left, left... A bit to the right... Stop! The light’s too small. Yeah. Excuse me, can you expand it a bit more? Well? Our time's nearly up. Yeah, the setting's fine. Thanks very much. It's alright. We should stand here. - Face this way? - This way. Hey, if the bride and groom are here, they can't see us... It can't be helped. - So we line up here. - Diagonally? Their view's blocked, so... That's how weddings are. They'll be happy seeing happy guests. What do you think, Yoshio? How about you? Whatever. Get your ass in gear, man! I don't think it matters with red loincloths on. I wasn't told about wearing a loincloth. Like we did for the school festival. Here? That's too embarrassing. This isn't high school. You look old, sauce. You haven't changed, Yoshio. Nej! That would ruin the wedding. - We're doing this for Nao. - I took the day off for this. We all had work today. Then let's make it more compact... But the phoenix, Kinichi! It has to be dynamic... Can we talk about it later? We can't stay. The bride and groom could... Hm? What, Yoshio? We could ask them to Stand here and watch... - I see. - Good idea. - Okay? - Yeah, Okay. Hello, excuse me... seriously, a red loincloth? - sorry, my wife's calling. - Your wife? - When'd you get married?! - Sorry. What's wrong? Was Sauce like that? It's not "Sauce" any more, it's "Mr. Sogawa.” Mr. Sogawa! They're fine with it. So we'll let you know when. When the five of you are ready... Six, not five. We'll signal you. Can we be in the front row? Yes, that'll be fine. I'll do my best. - Good luck. - Thank you. - Who's she? - The coordinator. She seems young. It's her third year. I asked because... It's just that... Yeah! - She looks like that girl! - The eyes! And how she works hard. What was her name? - Hitomi! - Yeah, Hitomi! - Gondo? - Not her. Hitomi Gondo wasn't pretty! Ms. Hitomi, the student teacher! I heard she got married. She must be 36 by now. Hitomi at 36 is nice, but so was Hitomi at 24. What shall we do after this? What's next? Well, let's practice tomorrow somewhere. How about today...? Shouldn't we practice? Today... Do we have rehearsals? I have a script to write, so... Yoshio, are you free? Yeah, I'll be in Tokyo till the wedding. I got work so tomorrow's better. What about you, Sauce? I have to go pick up my kid. You have a kid, too? - Boy or girl? - Wow, okay. Okay? - Let's check our marks... - We need to leave! Let's go. Working adults are scary. - He's pissed off. - Our time here's been up. Thank you. - I'll see you on the day. - Thank you. Sorry, your name was...? What's your name? I'm Hiromi Takeshita. Hiromi Takeshita. Their names are similar, too. This is Yoshio. We got together to do a dance for Nao's wedding that's three days away. It's been five years since we last gathered. - Let's go, Yoshio! - Okay! Long time no see! How've you dudes been! "What can I do to live in the moment With that in mind I will keep on singing Love and hurt someone Being loved and hurt by someone Then we grow up to be kinder than anyone love and hurt someone Being loved..." Hey! I used to be able to sing more. Shall we practice then? Wow, you're drinking a lot! I need to! It's boring every day! Drink, Sogawa! - I've an early start tomorrow. - There's no tomorrow! Sogawa! Sogawa! Sogawa! I'm not Sogawa! Soy sauce? Chilli sauce? I'm the Sauce! The Sauce is back! That reminds me of Aliens! I miss that karaoke place. We were having a post school festival party and... Machoka crashed it! I messed with Machoka, and Akashi was bleeding. Yeah! Why though? Akashi tried to stop the fight. Machoka was like, “Head injuries ain't no joke!” - Cheers. - Hey! It's been so long! How are you? Workin’ my ass off! You? Acting with Kinichi and working as a part-timer, dammit! Nice! Do you hang out with the others? I saw Hiro at the play, but it's been ages with you guys! You, Nej, and Yoshio. - The dance helps. - What? I mean, I don't know what to talk about. - Youre washing your hands. - Yes. You wash your hands after a piss. I jnow it's because your hands are dirty from touching your dick. But isn't it disrespectful to your dick? You should wash your hands and then touch your dick. Sorry, I don't get you. What do you think? Look at it this way. I'm washing my hands for the next time I touch my dick. I see... Thanks. What was that about? Isn't there gonna be a meteor shower soon? Dancing, huh? - The bloody head returns! - What? - From when Machoka crashed our party! - Oh! I still got the scar! No way! Show us! There's a patch of no hair. - Here? - Serious? Where is it? This? - There's a bump! - No, that's a bone. Well, it's around here... Hm? I think it's gone. All right, let's practice! - Quiet if you're a virgin. - That's you! Are you crying, Yoshio? No, he’s laughing! - Get it in unison! - Whose joke was that? Wait, I don't remember. All right, we should get going. Let's stay a bit longer. Folks, can you hear me? This is Tetsuya Akashi! Yo, Mr. Actor! Only three days to the wedding! How's the dance looking? - Perfect! - Great! Mr. Nej, how about you? - No, no mic for me. - Shy boy! Sing it! Let's end it here for today and practice again tomorrow! - What time shall we meet? - I've work tomorrow. - But it's a Friday! - Fridays are work days! How about we meet at 6:00 p.m., Yoyogi Park? - We're staying at your place. - Yeah. I've a girl though. You do? - What if I had one! - You got me. Lame. Sorry, attention please. Um... - Old lady! - I'm not! Anyways... - Old lady! - I'm not an old lady. We're short on props, Sp bring any red cloth at home. - For the loincloth? - I am not wearing a red loincloth! Finally, A word from Yoshio. Stand up. Go to the front. - Um... - Come on! It's been bothering me for a while. - What is it? - Tell us! About what? Aren't I supposed to be... Five years ago... You know what I mean. I'm dea... Will it really be okay? I'm beginning to like the red loincloth idea. With that dance, it's possible. - You see! - How about with a blank face? After the chorus, we keep a blank face. - Hilarious! - I know! And gradually our clothes come off! Strip down and scream. Then your dick comes out. - And cut the cake with it! - They'll be like, “Mm, yum.” The butter was good. Champagne's filling. We had to drink. You finish the script? Not yet. What script? We have a play next month in three weeks. - I asked you to be in my play once. - Oh, geez. I didn't know. - It's going to be fun, like before. - When? The time you expressed libido in a cramped place. That was five years ago. It's all different now. - You see any wedding staff? - No. It's always different. We do what we can in that moment. Theater size depends on the budget, too. Talking about theater? - Find it? - No, not yet. Hitomi is out of reach. She messed up a lot. - I had no seat. - That was a mistake. - You're back. - Find the CD? So, about the after-party... There's time. It starts at 6:00 p.m., so three hours. - That's too much! - What's with this schedule? What I meant was how can go after that performance? Okay, Okay. - Will they all be there though? - Yes. The bride's mom was moved to tears. By the guys before us. She stopped because of us. - How observant! - I couldn't look at the crowd. Hey. Why didn't you strip, Hiro? - You were supposed to strip. They were clearly disturbed. We all stripped down except for you. - Yeah! Strip now! - Yeah! Why'd you tease the audience then! To get the ball rolling. First of all, the loincloth offended everyone. Never mind the loincloth. You were laughing... Excuse me We kept our faces straight, but not you, Minichi! - Keeping a blank face was key! - No, it's not. - We all laughed, remember? - It's high school-level humor. I can't do this. Okay, let's go get a cup of tea. Right Akashi? Ney? You know, um... I'm sorry. Like, I was fine before the dance. But I couldn't bear everyone staring... You know I'm allergic to sesame seeds. I...think it was in the food... and it... Maybe we took it too seriously. I'm gonna go look for the CD. - What happened to him? - Yeah. He froze on stage. And there were no sesame seeds. We're amateurs who did our best. Isn't that good enough? Let's find a place to kill time. Aren't there any cafes? I'll go look. Need anything at the convenience store? One order of love. My God, he's in trouble. Wow, poor guy. Most women managers are strict. Why are they mixed? I told you to separate them! And this one. It's all of them! The cleanup crew has to set an example! Mikie? What's up? Yoshio! Did you teach them how to sort the trash? Oh, that's...I guess... I mean, maybe I didn't teach them right. Yeah, it's your fault. We apologize on his behalf, too. Dont you think you're being a bit... a bit rude? Yoshio, you have to set an example for the underclassmen. Be a better role model! The sunday cleanup meant nothing to you? But this is... you know... We were separating the trash, but you said we didn't need to. And that they burn all the same. Wow, Mikie! I'm glad we got new brave underclass... Take cleaning more seriously! Take cleaning more seriously! I'm sorry. - How scary. - Thank God that's over. Oh, it's you. You wash your hands after a piss, right? But isn't it disrespectful to your dick? You should wash your hands then touch your dick. Sorry, I got lost. We should wash our dicks. What's with your bag? It's cool. No! It's too bulky. Should everything be compact? Weirdo. Are you in any clubs? - Just the cleanup crew. - I know. So you're not busy. - No, I have to clean. - Who cares. Meet me after school. It'll be fun. The meteor shower! I can't believe you know about it. Today is...the Giaconibid meteor shower! It only happens once every 13 years and... Dude, shut up. We're doing a comedy skit. A comedy skit? Me? Hitomi needs more people, so you better show up! This cafe? They said it's in the corner. See them? Where's my love? "We can buy love ata store, but let's look some more.” - The cafes are all full. - Full of wedding guests. Oh, no way. I dont want to see them. What about pubs? They all open at five, So that won't work. Nao just asked us to do the dance at the party. - Seriously? - Who'd want to see that again! Nao wants to see it again. Oh, really? Hey, Akashi... Wait. Why are you crying? Huh? Last time I cried was at birth. But you're crying! No, it's just... I was remembering things. Like what? About...our dance of course. - You're so sensitive! - He shouldn't have teased the crowd. That's right! We're too old for loincloths! Let me give you these, again. Are you kidding? Who wore this? - Let's chuck it! - Chuck it! Hey! Aren't we gonna do it again? Yay, wait a minute! I was the funniest! Red loincloth! Oily body! Yes, but Yoshio was the star! Yoshio was amazing! Great voice! People call me Garuda. Garuda! Yoshio was boring. Hey, I'm your senior! I can't hear you ‘cause you mumble all the time! That sounds like sour grapes! You're ignored in your class! Are you crying, Yoshio? No, he’s laughing! - Here's Matsuoka! - Stop it! Seriously, let me out! This is stupid. Is this a party? We did a skit for the school festival. Don't you dare take a picture! Kiss my ass! I lost a game. Are you having an after-party? We did a sea shanty! At the main stage! I was drinking with some girls. Man, it was crazy. Everyone loved it. Ten years from now, we'll probably reminisce about today. I'll never forget it. I got emotional. My bad. Did you guys see it? We were doing the comedy skit at the same time. Where? In the science prep room. - In the back. - Wait... Is that you, Yoshio? You were in it, too. What was it about? Come on, answer me! Um, we stopped a meteor with red loincloths on. Oh, yeah? Show me! - Huh? - Do it! Three, two, one, go! Flap, flap. Rise, ye mighty gods. Stop that meteor with your red loincloths! Ah! Boom! What the hell? We have loincloths on and oil... Move, I'll show you. I'll stop the meteor with a sea shanty! Heave-ho! Heave-ho! How's that? Ain't it hilarious? - Ouch! - What're you doing, you idiot! - It was just too funny. - Right? Yeah! Ours is funnier. What? Ours is funnier. Right, Yoshio? Yoshio, who was funnier? You or me? I'm asking you a question. I'd have to say... You. - Right? - Oh, come on! - Hey, you're bleeding. - What? You are. There's a nail here. Where? Uh...around here. Who's under there? Who are you? Never mind. I've got a band aid in my room. - No, I'm fine... - Head injuries ain't no joke! Carry him. Watch his head! I said watch the head! Yo! Hurry up! Hey, go grab a band aid. He hit his head. Shit, that's serious. You forgot your... This is beer. What're you doing? - Man, that stinks! - Of course, it does. - Heave-ho! Heave-ho! - Stop it! Soran! Soran! What are you doing! He's gonna be fine. They took him to see a doc. It's all good! - Matsuoka, let's go. - All right! He drank it! He drank it! What a moron! Sorry about earlier. Dude, wasn't that going too far? You've got balls though. I could never say what you said. Mad respect. We should do something like this again. We'll figure out a way, so it's fine. Understood. - Any luck? - They only had two seats. - It's hopeless. - There's no way. - Anywhere else? - All pubs are full. - What's that? - The wedding's Instagram. Let's just go home. Get rid of that already. Yoshio, let's do the act again. What? We just did... Quit it! It stinks! Yoshio, you're not funny one bit! Hey! I'm your senior! Don't run away from me, Yoshio! Come back here! Oh my God! It's wet! There you all are. Did you find the CD? Hitomi had it. Just let her have it. No, I borrowed this. - From who? - India. - You borrowed from India? - Yeah. - Wanna do the dance? - We don't. The dance? Stop it. The dance, again? Don't lie to me. I'm not lying. - You're not a virgin? - No, I'm not. So that means you've had sex? Now it becomes conceptual. - Got toothpaste, Hiro? - Hey, focus. Look I think sex is all about the soul. The soul? "The body dies but the soul lives on." - Who said that? - Rokusuke Ei. "Humans die twice." Thanks. What're you talking about? - If Yoshio's a virgin or not. - He is. Not everything's black-or-white. You going to bed, college boy? Yes. I drank too much. I'm so popular right now. What I meant was I don't see onysical intercourse as Sex. Dick or no dick, two souls unite. You listen to CDs still? I can feel music on my CD Walkman. Ulfuls? You listen to Ulfuls? Ulfuls is the greatest. That's unexpected for Someone who's wishy-washy. - I never heard this one. - Listen and learn. I can borrow it? Thanks. Their song, "That's the Answer,” doesn't tell you the answer. Just like the question of virginity... We should've been snowboarding right now. Next time, should we go to India? Why India? I don't know. I feel like I can change. What about Sauce? He's not busy. He said, "If you two don't go, I'm gonna work.” We promised to keep the year-end free. They're busy. With the play, I know. They could've picked other dates. Would you go? No, I probably won't. You? India or play... I choose India. - Wanna go together? - No way. Yoshio. Anyone you fancy? I don't know. So there is someone. Anyone I know? I'll leave it to your imagination. - Ms. Hitomi. - No. - Kaori. - No. - Shino. - No. Mikie. Good night. You were in love with Mikie? Don't say that name. Why? Why? I'll get it out of you tomorrow. Good night. See you tomorrow. See you tomorrow... That's...nice. You were awake? There's just too much going on! That's nice? Just go back to sleep. Mikie, huh? Why? - It's so unexpected. - Oh, nell no. - Mikie! - Ow. Mikie! Don't say that name! - He started to talk. - What does he call you? - He says like, "Ba-ba!” - Like Barbapapa? Yeah, like Barba... No, idiot! - Pop-pop? - I'm not Grandpa! - Wow! You scared me, Yoshio. - What? - I didn't expect you. - But I've been here. Have we got a place to go? Nope. They're all full of other wedding guests. - Like kids on waiting lists. - For nurseries. - It's a social issue. - Politics must change. Shall we...dance? - We need another shot! - Yeah! Does it really matter anymore? Well, you started it. Who cares about the sideshow? Who cares... I'm glad it went down the way it did. You're okay with it? "Thanks for today. How was I? Love, Lynn." Hey, how was it for you? Excuse me, another glass please. I threw it away. Here, Yoshio's cup. You're a regular? Yoshio, always alone. - So sad. - Shut up. I love Sendai! Woo! Why'd you pick Lynn? We did paper-scissors-rock. I wanted Lynn, and you didn't care. Was Mayumi bad? No, you're missing the point. You work here, so why not see her another day? Daikon, egg, and flour paste cake please. Oh, stew? You want the stew. - It's inappropriate. - Why? Tsunami victims seek comfort from prostitutes, you know? It may be just fun for you but... Don't you get it? Then why did we go? If you can't read people's feelings, how can you act? So how bad was Mayumi? All you do is run! Fight me like a man! Is my stew coming? Daikon, egg, and what else? Flour paste cake. So I say let's fight together. I need you in the next play. I came all the way from Tokyo. So Tokyo's better than Sendai, huh? - No fish paste cake. - Flour paste cake! Not fish cake paste, flour paste cake! On, that. Your favorite Taro Okamoto said, "When in doubt, choose the hard way." For me, normal jobs are hard. This white thing? That's shirataki noodles. Stop reinterpreting others’ words to your liking. That last you play you did... exposing your pathetic life. You trying to say that you're all great now with your big troupe? Well, youre wrong there! You're still a frog in a well! Yes, that's flour paste cake! Ah, this is it? Enjoy. Hello. There's four of us. - Come, sit here. - Sorry. Get up and move over. Hurry, damn you! -|'m home. - Welcome. We're back again. It's been a day. Don't ask me to act. I'm trusting it to you. I work every day, so don't disappoint me. I'll come and see the play from Sendai with the red ticket. Don't get me in free. I'll pay to see it So I can say whatever I want. - Kenichi is gone wild! - Watch out! No! It's all wrong! We copied you. You're not giving it your all! Let your emotions explode! I can't feel you celebrating Nao! Not even in our smiles? I don't mean with our faces. More like, boom! - Should we say "boom"? - That's terrible. Harsh. Put your soul into it So people in the back can feel it. I don't understand. Okay. Let's try again. Right, Yoshio? What's got into you? - Can I grab a bite? - No! - I'd feel more ready. - Alright. All right, let's start at the beginning! Idiots. Three-second rule. - I'll be fine. - Sorry it had to be like this. No, no. Thanks for everything. A lot more people showed to his third death anniversary. Sorry, I couldn't come because of work. Keep in touch. Do you come here often? Well, I help his parents each year to contact people. - I see. - Yeah. Did you know Yoshio wanted to be in a boy band? - I just found out, too. - So lame. - He thought he was hot? - And his application photo! What's with the angle? He didn't get in though. The next visitor'll be here soon, So see you around. See you. By the way! I mean... Thanks for the cookies. I didn't come for this, but it looks like I did. It's Yoshio's favorite, so eat it. I will. Mikie? - Hiro? - Yes. You did something with Yoshio at the school festival. Why're you here? I came to offer incense. In that case, Nej is out front. Oh. See you. Um... How're things lately? What do you mean? You know, I was just wondering... Um...well... You can't just spring that up on me. Oh, my goodness. It's hot! I'm your senior and that's very flattering, but I... No, no! I don't have any feelings for you at all! Hiro, you bastard! Don't mess with me! - How do you feel about Yoshio? - Sad! What else! Yes, ma'am! I'm sorry. Damn. "That's the answer..." Arm, arm... Oh, Mikie! Coming to the after-party? Yeah, after we practice. You're seriously gonna do that again? You're seriously gonna do that again? Wait, Mikie. - Get lost, Hiro! - I'm sorry, but... Yoshio has something to say. Um, not really... Yoshio? Why? How come you're here? Long time no see. How've you been? Spill it. I want to go to the party. What're you doing? It's for Instagram. I need you to delete your account. Facebook and Twitter. I can't get myself to unfriend you. Your contact in my phonebook too. Every year I'm reminded of your birthday. It's frustrating ‘cause I can't click "like"! Um, I’m sorry...well... - Yoshio's in love with you. - Stop it, Hiro! Go! It's your last chance. Um... We were in the cleanup group In high school and... And...together... On Sundays, we'd clean and talk a lot. Nobody cleaned the smelly barn. But you felt sorry for the barn and cleaned it. You were an angel. I've loved you forever. I've been in love with you since day one. This is my daughter, Hana. Here's more Oh, she's so cute. Aw she closed her eyes. So cute. I'm sorry. My friends are waiting. See you at the after-party. See you later. By the way, your dance was terrible. Don't do it. It was hell. Don't ruin the celebration! Hey, Mikie! Be happy! - I already am happy! - She came back! It was a perfect ending! Were you listening? I am happy. - I just thought... - Stop mumbling! - I just thought... - Stop mumbling! You know I'm already dead. - What! - I'm dead... So what? That's how you're gonna play? So please be nice... You're dead, so what? That makes you great? You're the same. You're only dead when it's convenient. You haven't changed! Dead or alive, you're still you! I'm sorry. So sorry... So... Did you get it all out? I think so... - What's all this for? - You've got unfinished business. I don't, but I do feel better. - Yay! - Good for you. You've been around a while. Of course. - I thought you'd go up in smoke. - It felt like the climax. "Be happy!” Then you turn into smoke. When are you gonna go to heaven? You're missing your opportunity to pop off. - Now's a good time. - Make it somber then. - Okay. - Somber it is. - Here we go. - Ready? Lift! Ready? Hey, let's put him down for a minute. - You're heavy. - But why? - Could you go? - I never said I could. - Hey! - Why? And you remain in twilight... - Don't linger. - Are you even dead? - I'm hella dead. - Who says that? Maybe I'm in your subconscious. - This is our fault? - You've never crossed my mind. I only remember useless stuff. - So he'll go if we forget? - No, don't. Okay, Okay. Let's forget him. - Yes, completely. - Goodbye, Yoshio. Hey guys... The sun's setting. It's going down. The golden hour. What do we do now? - I'm tired. Let's get a tax. - No, let's walk. - Will one car do? - Not for five. - It's SIX. - Split two and three. I'll go grab the cab. Come on, guys! Hey! - Shut up! - I didn't disappear. - You're impossible to get rid of. - I'm not a stain. I don't really remember you. Remember the last time we all got together? - Oh, hey! It's Yoshio. - Long time no see! We thought it was you. Nej insisted I stay for his speech. - You came from Sendai? - Yeah, but I'm going back. - Let's have a drink. - Yoshio, you busy? - Thanks, guys. - You sucked! I haven't been on stage in forever. - Where's Kinichi and Akashi? - Talking with some big shots. That's nuts! Your big face is good for the stage. - Shut your trap. - And your giant nostrils. Hey! What a weird bag! It's not weird, it's cool! Yoshio, you came! Thanks! - It was funny and felt nostalgic. - Don't even. You didn't need me. - Yes, I did! - You're coming, right? - He's leaving. - To Sendai today? - Stay at Hiro's. - Why mine? - Just one drink. - I'm good. Bye. Wait, dickhead! You ain't going nowhere! Have you used it yet? I'm gonna miss the bullet train. Let's drink together some time. Call me if you miss it. - Same number? - Yeah. Let's dance in red loincloths again. Just bugger off. Bye. - Thanks! - See you! - Buy a T-shirt. - Why? - Why not? - I've no money. - Congrats! - Thanks! - I said no such thing. - Yeah! Which scene was that? Yoshio Um... As expected, I missed the bullet train and was wondering what to do... Akashi, answer your phone! I guess I'll take the redeye bus home. The play was really great. I'll come and see the next play, so keep it up. - Get this. - I like this. - Paprika? - No. - What are we having? - Hot pot, so... Leeks. Mushrooms! Lots of them! Yay, mushrooms! Let's get them all! - Shiitake. - It's half price. - A text from Yoshio! - It's been a while. I wonder what's up? This is Yoshio’s father. My son passed away. We will hold a wake tomorrow. What did he say? H...Hold on... Hello? Did you see? Did you know? I just found out. I saw him the other day. It was his heart... I don't understand. Bye. You all right? Yeah, I'm... I'm fine. It's about social injustice and accusation of silent individuals. It was nominated for the Kishida Prize last year. Sorry, it's a bit difficult for you. No, it's fascinating. Great stuff. - Your troupe only does comedy, right? It appears that way, but Kinichi tries to... Cheat society with a cheap laugh? What the hell! Excuse me, young man. Is this bike yours? That girl always has to say something. I know, right? I noticed, too! What's wrong? What do you usually do? Um...I jerk off and sleep every day. Come on, man. You gotta face society! What's your opinion of today's politics? Only those with nothing better to do does serious stuff. What's with you, Akashi? You try doing comedy! You think quiet plays are better? Are big theaters mighty? Say something, Kinichi! Comedy rules! We rule! It was in front of me. I just wanna be home! I got no money! I'm tired! So I felt like borrowing it! I'd like to go home, too. I feel the same, but I still try my best. What! So hang in there, son! We're all tired but doing our best. You'll catch a cold. I'm truly sorry! I was being cocky! Hey, Ney. Are you in love with anyone? Geez, that's heavy. - 1OO heavy. - It's been five years. - Here comes the gloom. - Bam. Was it... Like this? Yeah, just like this. I guess so. What about this? Is that his? Yeah, I kept it. He's become a bag? No. He existed, too. Let's chuck it. I couldn't. - You gonna take it home? - We can split it. - Let's bury it. - Yeah, let's. How about over there? - It's someone's land. - That's okay. Oh, are you okay? - That was funny. - No, it was not. Holy shit! It stinks! What a smell! I bet someone pissed here! - This place sucks! - Yoshio stank, so this is fine. It's perfect for that cheesy bastard. I think I'll bury this CD I borrowed, too. - And the loincloth. - No, don't. The stench though! This sucks... It's bloody hot. It's really not. It's hot and stinky. - My back hurts. - It never used to before, huh? It was spring, too. Around the same time. - What? - Nothing. What is it? At the. wake, he had huge cotton balls up his nose. Really big ones. Normal ones would go too far back. I snorted and the flower petals flew. After the cremation, there was a big pile of bones. Not enough heat? Were they all pubic bones? It won't fit in the urn. They had to bang them into bits! Hello? What are you doing? Who are you? We're just passing by. It's my family's farm. Put it back. Yes, we'll do that. Look, you're trespassing. Take your hat off. What? We're burying your'stuff. - So? Don't cause problems. - Hang on. - Don't cause problems. - Hang on. You're causing the problem. The way you come and go like this. Did you sort that garbage? - I'm calling the police. - We're so sorry. I‘ll answer next time! Call me if you miss it. - Same number? - Yeah. Let's dance in red loincloths again. Just bugger off. How could you fucking die! How are we suppose to live! Screw you, man! Screw you! Akashi, calm down! Fuck you, Kinichi! Stop clowning around! Be a clown! Don't you remember? We were always clowning with him! Stop trying to make it black-or-white! Dwell on the past! Let's just... clown around like we used to. Kinichi... Sorry. I mean, what's that? A heart. Hey, don't take my heart out! Put it back! Put it back! My heart's gonna stop! We're gonna die! Put it back! I can't! Thump, thump... It's...It's moving! You've gone beyond death... He lit himself! He's burning! What a blaze! He burned out! He's turned into ashes. Has he disappeared? Could it be... The Phoenix of eternal time! Also known as, Garuda. Garuda! Life has no rules. You can live without a heart. No way! He's... - I've your heart. - How come? Okay, me too! Here's mine. All right! - Even without a heart! - We can live! Hey, do you hear us! This is the other side of life! We did it! What's happening? I don't think I'm gonna make it... My heart's slipping... Guys, massage your heart! Like this! I wanna live. Enough! We'll be fine without it! What the hell! Stop! Ow! We don't need it! Where are we? It's so beautiful. Better than a rainbow. Yoshio! - What're you doing? - Where were you? You came to this side. It's too soon for you guys to die. We're...dead? I don't get it. - Let's go home. - No, go without me. What about our dance at the after-party? What dance? I'm not part of that future. We practiced a lot. I wish! My time has stopped since then. Geez, you guys are getting old. You've become old men. We need you to keep the formation. That guy's not me. You're too stuck in the past. That guy's not me. You're too stuck in the past. Well, it doesn't feel like you're gone. We think about you even more now. It was a weird goodbye. You didn't answer my call. That doesn't really bother me. Look, I died six months after that. Just rewrite the past as you see fit. Even about Mikie, too? Don't say her name! But you like Ulfuls, right? They're just one of the bands I like. I'm starting to get annoyed. - This is what we get after five years? - I didn't miss you. - Unbelievable! - Seriously? Were our memories embellished? Wasn't he kind and reliable? - It's just a weird bag. - Ow! Stop. This is fun. Ouch! Geez. Congratulations, Nao and Tomoe! For our skit during high school, - Nao was our sound operator. - What? Shut up. Today, we dedicate this to you. Not to you, Yoshio. That's right, that's so right! That's right, that’s so right! Congrats! On your wedding! You suck! Now the answer is "that." - It's too cold for this. - Ah-huh. Don't ignore me! Let's go back then. Hey. Hey, assholes. Hey! You fools! Don't try to please me with dancing and comedy skits. It makes me happy, but... it doesn't! You're a bunch of fools. Did you hear something ? Are you crying, Kinichi? No, he's laughing! Okay! Can we go? Let's rewrite the past. So first, you guys were... - Around here. - Then Yoshio came from... Over there. - The closer the more dynamic it'll be. - We don't have time! Wait. Is this the theater? Why are we here? I don't know, but we're rewriting the past. What? We're rewriting our memory of that moment. There he is! - Oh, hey! It's Yoshio. - Long time no see! We thought it was you. Nej insisted I stay for his speech. - You came from Sendai? - Yeah, but I'm going back. - Let's have a drink. - Yoshio! - Thanks, guys! - You sucked! I haven't been on stage in forever. Where's Kinichi and Akashi? They're...talking with some big shots. That's nuts! Your big face is good for the stage. Shut your trap. - And your giant nostrils. - Wassup! Hey! What a weird bag! It's not weird, it's cool! Yoshio, you came! Thanks! - It was funny and felt nostalgic. - Don't even. You didn't need me. Yes, I did! Shut up. You're coming, right? He's leaving. What? To Sendai today? - Stay at Hiro’s place. - Why mine? Just one drink! I'm good. Bye. Wait, dickhead! You dickhead! Have you used... I'm gonna miss the bullet train. Okay, maybe another time. Let's get together some time. Call me if you miss it. - Same number? - Yeah. Let's dance in red loincloth again. Just bugger off, you bastard. Bye. - See you soon! - See ya! Yoshio, see you again! Shut up...don't cry. The sun's setting. It's going down. The golden hour. What do we do now? I'm tired. Let's get a taxi. Will one car do? Not for five. Split two and three. Are we still doing the dance? The party's lit right now. So what? We just live on. Let's go karaoke afterwards. An after-after-party? Remain in Twilight Remain in Twilight Enough twilight. Remain in Twilight Remain in Twilight It's lingering. Remain in Twilight Sauce, ditch the loincloth. Why? What was that? See the sweat on my back? Oh, it's pathetic My tingers turning pale and quivering Of, it's so embarrassing It wasn't the answer Yeah, it wasn't the answer I was so confident and so wrong It happened so fast at such a shocking level I tripped Nobody cares to notice In this cold-hearted town I cried If this isn't the answer either Yeah, if this isn't the answer either Then oh well I feel refreshed The pressure’s gone I'll make you laugh I'll make you laugh With my bad dream-like reality Make me laugh Make me laugh In the depths'of despair that makes me cry Being number one or the only one Enya Kora, who cares ‘cause Elephants and mice are both grey Listening too much to others will throw you off Not enough, you spin off if so, I just pretend to listen and forget it all I'll make you laugh I'll make you laugh With my bad dream-like reality Make me laugh Make me laugh In the depths of despair that makes me cry I'll make you laugh I'll make you laugh I won't run or hide at this point How do I explain this fuzzy feeling ? Sweet, bitter, and aching feeling In this endlessly repeating days, what crosses my mind Enya Kora, the great race to tomorrow! That's the answer!
