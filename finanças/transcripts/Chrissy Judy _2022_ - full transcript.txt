Also, what is the vibe? Are we feeling like a pool party moment? Or... Actually, uh...

I know I said I'd stay for the day, but I need to be on the 8 a.m. ferry. You're joking. I'm sorry. Look, I've been trying to find a time to talk with you about this. Uhm. You know, Shawn and I, we are. Back on the merry-go-round. We're trying to figure out what the possibility of a future looks like for us if we want to continue dating, which I do. And we decided what makes the most sense for us right now is that we be closer in proximity. So tomorrow I'm meeting with H.R. to put in a request to transfer it to the Philadelphia store. You're gonna commute to Philly for work? Now, Judy, I'm moving there. Fuck off. I'm sorry for springing it on you like this. I just didn't want to say anything before the show, and I was going to tell you... Oh, my God. Are you serious? When? The first. Like, next week, the first? I know that this seems like it's coming out of left field, but it is something that Shawn and I have been talking about for a while. And I thought that I would wait until the end of the summer, but my lease is up, and he asked me to come and stay. I'm sorry. Your moving in with Shawn? Yeah. It's something he suggested, and we want to try it. What about our gigs? I need to take a little break. For how long? I don't know. OK, I need a couple of months. We have the lounge next week. Judy you are brilliant, and you don't need me. It's the Chrissy Judy show. What the fuck am I gonna do alone on stage for two hours? - It's a shitty gig that barely. - Two hundred bucks. That we split! - Plus tips! It could turn into a weekly thing. That's... - That's exposure. - And then what are we gonna do? Judy, I'm... - I want financial stability. I want to buy a house someday. I want to travel. I want to have a boyfriend. Look, performing with you is so much fun. I really love it. But how much longer are we gonna keep spinning our wheels on this? I thought... That was the plan. I think this is going to be a really great opportunity to regroup and for me to see what happens when I shift my priorities. Priorities with Shawn in Philadelphia. - Judy. - You're going to hate it there. - Judy! I'm sorry for bringing it up like this, but I'm really excited and I want you to be happy for me. You know what? I think I'm actually going to stick around, have a drink. Can you just take all this shit back to the house for me? Yeah, sure. - Yeah? - Oh, fuck. Yeah. - Hey. - Hey.

That's just a friend of mine, we don't really work together anymore. Oh, gotcha. Well, then it sounds like a good time for a fresh start. Yeah. Originally, I was thinking of calling myself Sweet Lorraine because I love that jazz standard, and it was my mom's nickname growing up. And you went with Judy Blu'em? All my friends call me Judy, and I just... I don't know, I went with it once at Halloween and it just sort of stuck. Yeah. I mean, it sounds like a lot of thought went into that. - I still stand by Judy. Shit. You don't smoke, do you? I know where we can get some. Why does that not surprise me?

He's very matter of fact. "This is my boyfriend, Chris." So I'm like, OK, I guess we're boyfriend. Yeah, his whole vibe is like, very like, teddy bear total top. Oh, God. The dick is good girl. Oh. I mean, he definitely has his routine that he likes to stick to, but I'll get him to switch it up eventually. As long as you're satisfied. Are you happier here? What's that supposed to mean? Are you happier here than you were in New York? I mean, it's different. There are things that I miss, but. I feel like I'm supposed to be here right now. Think you'll ever move back? I never thought it'd leave in the first place. Me neither. All right, well, I love you, - But now I'm going to go to sleep. - Fine. - Good night. - Good night. Chrissy? What? Is he just gonna like, follow you into your room or...? - Oh, I'm sorry. - He usually sleeps in here. Dash. Come here. - Dash. - Come here. - Dash! - Come on, boy. I'm sorry honey. - Good night. - Good night. Such a good boy. [ dog whimpering ] [ dog whimpering ] Come on. - Oh my God. This place is gorgeous. - They did a really good job. - You should have seen it before. Hey. Happy 4th! - Good to see you. - Hi guys. Before we take one more step, we have some news. Oh, my God. Finally. Oh, my God. Congratulations. - That's so exciting. - Hi. I am so happy you're here. Thank you for having me. I really appreciate the invitation. Oh, my God, your house is absolutely amazing. - Did you make that? - I did make it. Do you like strawberries? I love strawberries. These are my favorite pieces. Aren't they fabulous? So mid-century. I pulled them out of the garbage. Javier hates them. But you know what? - If I had bought these these at Brimfield. - Are you getting bit? - It's your cologne. How much longer till we get to the part of the tour where there's a bar? Do you need mustard for your hot dogs? Javi, where's the mustard? Actually, I'd love a drink. Oh, where are my manners? I'm sorry. - I can't believe I didn't get you a drink. - Judy's not shy. Well, what would you like? - Do you have any alcohol? - Lots. - I'll have that. - Oh, my soul mate. Come inside. I'll show you the kitchen renovations we did. Hi, Ed. How are you? This is James. This is Chris's friends. Oh, it's Judy. Ed just moved in next door. He's an architect from the city. Sorry, they love me. It's part of the charm of this place. - Is it? - Yeah. Thanks. It used to be marshlands until maybe a hundred years ago. And then they built a dam, and now it's all cranberry bogs. I like cranberry, though, so I was happy about it. Thanksgiving is, like, my favorite holiday. - Oh, really? - Yeah. You a fan. I like the cranberry sauce, not the family part of Thanksgiving. Oh, I don't agree. - So I've really got into birdwatching lately. Now, I haven't spotted one yet. - So, it's more like bird hearing. - Wait, did you hear that? - I hear there's bald eagles around here so I've been listening for a bald eagles, so then I can see it. You know, we're very glad that Chris has moved down here. I think him and Shawn make such a good pair, don't you think? Yeah. I mean, it must be so hard dating in New York. I know so many guys that just move down here and immediately get snatched up like that. Yeah, I don't really follow heteronormative dating patterns, so I couldn't tell you. I feel like all the gay guys I know in relationships are pretty miserable. Have you tried any of this? Yeah, it was delicious. Yeah, it looks amazing. I have to get the recipe for this. What is it? It's just Sara Lee with cool whip and berries on top. OK, well, the presentation is gorgeous. Would you excuse me? Yeah, sure. - Hi. - Hey. You left me. Oh, I'm sorry. Shawn is going to get us some water. Do you want some? You know, I would love another one of those bourbon iced tea thingys. Why don't you have some water? Bourbon. Thanks. Sure. Sure thing. Thank you. What the fuck? You just left me in there with, Mr. Personality. What? He's sweet. He's boring. Well, Javi and Brad thought that you two might hit it off. You're joking. He's really smart. He has a great job, and he owns two houses. Would you fuck him? Juldy, don't be tacky. Relationships are about more than sex. It's kind of a big part of it. OK, well, if you don't want to talk to him, you don't have to. They just thought... Thought what? That I want to move out here and get set up with some boring guy who lives in Philadelphia. And then what? I'd move out here and live happily ever after like you? Judy, don't start. I'm a marsh creature. I live here now. OK, these are new friends. Could you please not do that here? Oh, my God. It's not fucking meth, girl. I'm sure everybody here has smoked a little weed before. We've been here for one hour and you're already a mess. Oh, I am not. [ coughing ] Here we are. Smells like someone's having a good time. Thank you. I sure am Shawn, would you like to have a little fun too? No, thanks. Should we make our way down to the lake? Yeah, that's a fantastic idea. Delightful. - Everything OK? - No. But we have to allow these neighborhoods to gentrify. Actually, studies prove it does nothing to promote economic growth. What's the alternative? To let the neighborhoods rot? Well, we need legislation. How? How? It's. It's un-American. Honestly, it's the same thing we saw in Bushwick and Williamsburg ten years ago. - You mind taking our photo? My phones underneath that towel? I'm sorry. Are you actually trying to compare New York to Philadelphia? In terms of urban development. No. Philadelphia, I mean, no offense it's cute, but like... Well, okay. Hey now. She's been here one day and already she's an expert. You've been here a month, girl. Wait till the honeymoon ends. Yo! Judy. What? You're in the lake. You don't want to get wet? Why don't you go drink some water? I'm curious to hear more what you have to about Philadelphia. Judy. Well, first of all, I think everyone here is a little overweight and talks funny. Judy! - Hey! - Stop being such a cunt. Uh oh! Here comes Chrissy's friend to expose the cracks in her carefully manicured reality. I wouldn't want to ruin another picture of you and "this guy" for the Gram. - We need to get her out of here. - Yeah. It's just funny, because I know the real story. I was there the last time they ended things. You remember what you said? He said Shawn wasn't good enough. - Did you know they tried dating before this? Yeah, twice. Although, why would you? Cause it's not like Shawn ever posts pictures of Chris. I hardly post anything on social media. - Oh, you don't? How noble. Do you still want your picture? No! Yes. You know what? Get a picture of this! - No, Judy. Don't! [ splash ] Ow! Fuck. It's really shallow here. OK, it's time to go. You guys, I am so sorry. You do not have to apologize for me. Don't touch me. OK. We need to get you changed, and we need to get you sobered up, and we need to leave. I am so sick and tired of everyone telling me what I need to do, what I should be doing, to be happy, to be successful, to find my path. I see the way you look at me. Thinking I'll be alone forever. Just some sad, old faggot still dressing up like a woman and you hate the thought of that cause, you know it could just as easily be you. And that fucking terrifies you. Well, you don't have to worry about me, ok? I like my life the way it is. It's fucking fabulous. - Stop. Go back to your friends. I'm going to call a car. You can't get a car out here. We're in New Jersey. I want my person back. When did you start acting like all these people used to make fun of? Do you think I'm stupid? You think I don't know what you mean when you say that you want to take some time off to shift your priorities? You quit. You gave up everything, and for what, Shawn? You gave up your life in New York, your apartment, your job. You walked out on me. You completely derailed my career. God! Judy! Get over yourself. I've never met a more selfish human in my entire life. You think you're the main character. You think every decision I make is somehow about you? It's not. Every question you ask me, every underlying thought is somehow, "But what about me?" Well, you know what, Judy? It's not about you. I want you to be the best version of yourself. I want you to have the life that you dream of. But I'm not responsible for helping you get there. I'm not responsible for carrying you along the way. Oh, carrying me? Carrying me? Everything that I did, I did for us. You did nothing but hold me back. You're delusional. Well at least you're finally being honest with me. Judy.

You were fabulous tonight, Sweet Lorraine. - I love it. - Thanks. I wanted to say hi. You had an entourage. I saw you on your bike yesterday. Yeah, I saw you on yours. I texted Jay and Lucas. They said you moved up here for the summer. Yeah, I took that job at their friend's B&B. They had an opening this season and it... It's uhm... It's been a really great summer. I can tell. The stars are so bright. I know. Did you go out to celebrate after? - I went to Fag Bash for a little. It's actually, it's my last night, so I just wanted to... take a stroll, say goodbye to the town. You know. You headed back to New York? Mhm. 10 AM ferry. Me, too. And then Philly. Where's Shawn? He didn't have any vacation days left, and I just... needed a weekend. Nice. I'm sorry. Am I interrupting? Did you want to just... No, no, no. I was... It's funny, I kind of thought I might find you out here. Same. I come out here all the time. And every time I'm here I think about that night that we were rolling. And we saw the foxes just playing around on the beach and... we had convinced ourselves that that fox was, like, us in some other dimension of reality. - Like, just frolicking... - Judy! - Oh, my God. Hi. - Do you think that's the same little guy? Look, I have been thinking about you a lot, and I'm sorry... for cutting you off there, I just... No, I... I deserved it.

I think being apart has been really good for me. It seems like it. So what's next? I have no idea. Scary. Hey. Girl... I don't know either. I'm starting to realize. I think it's just... always going to be that way. I was going to walk out a little bit, maybe stay up and watch the sun rise, if you wanted to...
