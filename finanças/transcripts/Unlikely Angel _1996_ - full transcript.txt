See you later. [cheering] Charlie, you back here sweetie? [faint laughter] [knocking] Hi Ruby, how you doing? Charlie. Ain't this a pretty picture? [laughs] Now listen, this is not what it looks like. Now, Tammy just wanted to see my new truck. Yeah, he was just trying to show me-- How to shift his gears? Well now come on, wait a minute, Ruby. Hey Ruby, hey Ruby! Now wait a minute. Oh come on, listen, you know that I love you. Save your breath, Charlie. It's me you talking to, remember? You haven't exactly been living in no convent, you know. There's not a guy in three states that you haven't come on to. Listen, anyhow, you were the one that said that you didn't want to get tied down to anybody. I know, I know, you're right. I don't even blame you, Charlie. I blame myself for hanging around this dump so long. I should have left a long time ago. Maybe you should just stick around a little while longer. We can work this thing out. Now come on baby, it's almost Christmas time. Remember last Christmas, don't you? Remember last Christmas? [laughing] Well, we did have fun. Just a little bit. Ah, Ruby, come on, that girl, she don't mean nothing to me. It's no use, Charlie. You're never going to change... and neither am I. And I usually have a feel for when it's time to go and it's time. So why don't you just give me my money and I'll hit the road. Fifty bucks? I pulled you the rest. [sighs] God as my witness, Charlie, I am never going to play a crummy place like this again. I am going to play in a real classy joint someday. You'll see. Well, well, send me a postcard. I will. Goodbye, Charlie. Goodbye, Ruby. And Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas.

[heavy crash] [Christmas music continues to play] [thunder] ♪ [music] ♪ ♪ [choral singing and harps] ♪ Hello, Ruby. How'd you know my name? And where am I? And who are you? You may call me Peter. Peter? You're not... I don't like to say it, but uh... Well my momma used to say, &quot;Don't hide your light &quot;under a bushel.&quot; Oh, I know. She still does. You mean Momma is up here? And Papa and Grandma? They're all here. They've been waiting for you. [sighs] I don't suppose Uncle Clem is-- Oh. I didn't think so. This has got to be some kind of mistake. I'm too young to die. In the first place, I haven't done a tenth of the things I've wanted to. We hear that a lot. But I got a lot of plans. I got my career, I haven't met the right man yet. Are you absolutely certain I'm dead? [chuckles] Oh, absolutely. [thunder rumbles] So, this is really it. Well, do I get my wings now or what? Oh, I'm afraid you have to earn those. Well what about all these other people? They're getting their wings right away. That's because they lead virtuous lives. Yet you, on the other hand. Well now, I know I ain't exactly been a saint. But then who is? Well, present company excepted. Now where did I put that entry? You begin to lose your memory after the first couple of thousand years, uh. Ah, here it is. All your life you have done exactly as you wanted, gone where you wanted, said what you wanted. You have never thought of anyone else but yourself. Well if you had no intentions of sticking a halo over my head, why'd you drag me up here in the first place? Why didn't you send me on down to Uncle Clem? Well now, that certainly is an option. But then I began thinking about that little deer... The one whose life you saved on that mountain road. You sacrificed your life for the sake of another living thing. That gave me a glimmer of hope that you just might be a better person than the record of your life reflects. So, I thought I should give you a chance to redeem yourself. Well, what'd you have in mind? You will return to Earth. You will help a family in trouble. You will have the week remaining until Christmas to set things right. Well what's wrong with them? You'll soon see. Now, if the mission is a success, you will get your wings and you will become an angel. And if it's not? Now, I want to leave you with three very important rules. Oh, I hate rules. I know. Number one, you are not to tell anyone that you are trying to become an angel. Number two, you must avoid certain temptations which... given your... How shall I put this? Affection for the opposite sex, it might present quite a challenge. Well, I'll give it my best shot. Make it a bulls eye. Failure is not an option. But if you need me, look heavenward. I'll try and respond promptly. Oh, and one last very important thing. You must have completed your mission... ...by Christmas Eve, midnight. Midnight on Christmas Eve. You got it. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm late... for choir practice. You do have a choir. You know, I always wondered about that. I used to sing in church when I was... Peter? Peter, where'd you go? You didn't tell me where I'm going-- [screams] I don't care if you have to move heaven and Earth, I want everyone in my office in exactly 35 minutes. Yeah, that's right. And also get Al to call me ASAP. [heavy thud] Uh! [thud] Yeah, okay. [groans] You got to be kidding. All I need's a guitar and I'll be ready for The Sound of Music. Very funny. [engine approaching] Nice bike. Thanks. - See you. - See you later. Give me a second. Where have you been? And who is that kid? Dad, don't freak. Jeremiah just wanted to give me a ride on his new bike. At nine o'clock in the morning? He had to go to work. I don't want you riding on that thing again. I don't want you seeing him at all. Do you understand? Why don't you just lock me in my room until I'm 21? Fine, you're grounded. You're late. [talking on phone] No, not you. Glad to meet you too. [Ben on phone] No, no, no listen to me. I didn't... I need to have that copy on my desk by 10 o'clock. Yeah, right. Okay... that's right, yes. Yeah. 10:30, yeah, right, and then I want you to fax the pink pages over to the client, okay? Good, just do it. I'm sorry, I'm Ben Bartilson. Boy, I sure hope you're good, because I got to tell you, my kids haven't liked anybody that the agency has sent over. Well, maybe it's time you stopped asking their opinion. I like your attitude. Ruby Diamond. That's an interesting name. Yeah, everybody says I'm a gem. Yeah, well, you're certainly different, that's for sure. Well, I mean, just most of the nannies, they look like normal, well, I mean, not that you're not normal. You're very normal. I hope not. [laughs] But I'll take that as a compliment. Did your wife already leave for work? My wife passed away two years ago. And look, don't try to get the kids to express their feelings about it, because it just makes matters worse believe me. Matthew, Sarah, meet your new nanny. You can call me Ruby. Are you sure she's a nanny? Ben: Be good, guys. She's a little late for Halloween. Sarah, apologize to Roxy. Ruby, and don't apologize. I like when people say what they mean, and mean what they say. And don't you worry, me and these kids are gonna get along just fine. - [telephone ringing] - Whatever. Yeah, Ben Bartilson. Al, where have you been? The meeting's been pushed to 10:30. Well, this is more important. I'm almost 14. I don't need a nanny. I'm only eight, but I don't need one either. Is that a fact? Well, I am twice as old as both of you put together, and believe me, I would love to have a nanny. Just get the presentation and we can figure that out later. Yeah, I'm on my way. Okay you guys, I got to go. Be good and don't give Trudy any trouble. - Ruby. - Right. Now, emergency numbers are by the phone, and I usually work late so don't hold dinner for me. Dad.

Now, wait, you guys, come back here. Hey, come on now. [door slams] Matthew, are you two just going to stay up in your rooms all day? I guess so. Why not?

You just need to get used to each other. It'll be okay, goodnight. Mr. Bartilson. Ben. Well, Ben, I've been wondering about something all day. Couldn't help but notice there's not a sign of Christmas in this house. Not a tree, nothing at all. Well, we don't really celebrate Christmas around here anymore. Well, it may be none of my business, but I personally think the kids could use a little Christmas spirit. And so could you, if you don't mind my saying so. Well, you're right, it isn't any of your business. Goodnight, Ruthy. Uh, Mr. Bartilson. What is it now? There's one more thing. My name is Ruby and I'd like you to remember that. Goodnight, Ruby.

Look, I don't know what is that, bacon and eggs? Come on. Something smells good. Yeah, it's waffles and maple syrup. Waffles? I'm sure it's like 3,000 calories. Well try a glass of skim milk with it. Okay, I want everybody to sit all at once together. See if you can act like a real family for a change. Of course, now that means no newspapers, - no rock and roll. - What are you doing? - And no electronic devices. - Hey! Just some good old fashioned conversation for a change. All right, go ahead. Um, what's new, kids? Oh, Dad, I have something really important I need to ask you. Good. -You know Rachel? -Yeah. She invited me to go skiing with her family. When? Um,they're leaving in like a couple of days. Well, how long are they going to be gone? Like five, six days, probably. You mean over Christmas? Her parents are renting this really cool cabin and everything. Okay, I can understand how you want to go, but I'm sorry, the answer's &quot;no&quot;. [Sarah] Well, why not? Would you at least think about it? Look, I don't have to think about it. You're grounded and I don't want you going away for Christmas. It's not like we do anything on Christmas anyway. [Ben] That's not the point. [Sarah] Then what is the point, to make me miserable? The point is to be with your family. What family? [door slams] Eat your waffle, Matthew. I'm not hungry anymore. You've barely touched it at all. What's the matter with you now? Why do you always have to pick on me? [door slams] [exhales] Thanks for breakfast. [rock music plays] [knock on door] Sarah? Sarah? I thought you might want to talk. About what? About anything you want to. You know, you remind me an awful lot of myself when I was your age. Yeah, sure. Oh, I was pretty rebellious, let me tell you. What do you say I go make us some hot cocoa, we go sit by the fire, have a heart to heart, and just be girls? Yeah, and then maybe you could paint my nails and teach me how to put on blush. Well sure, if you like. Yeah, right. [rock music plays] I've enjoyed our little chat too. [video game noises] Aww, sure looks like a lot of fun. Wouldn't you rather go outside and toss a ball around instead? Not really. Oh, you must have a football around here somewhere in all this junk. I'm not very good at real football. I'm better at this. Hey, you're in my way. Well maybe when your dad comes home, he-- He never has time. Besides, I told you, I'm not very good. [cheering on video game] You got to help me out here, Peter. I can't even get those kids out of their rooms. How am I going to help them at all? [electronic fizzling] [pops, glass shatters] Hey, that's not a bad idea. I'll try it. [groans] The electricity went off. I'll go check the circuit breakers. Ahh, don't bother, I've just checked it. Well, what happened? Must have blown a fuse or something. Well, no wonder, with that computer, the stereo, that video game upstairs all going at once-- That's ridiculous. I'm going to call the electrician. Now wait just a second, sit down. I don't want to sit down. Well I don't care what you want. Park it. Look, I know you're not thrilled about me being here. And believe me, this is not what I planned either. But we're stuck together, at least for a while. So, I would suggest that we try to make the best of it. I notice you haven't been celebrating Christmas around here lately, and I don't know why. Christmas happens to be my favorite holiday in the whole wide world and I don't intend to skip it this year. It means a lot to me.

Now, I don't know if it's grief or just plain selfishness and I don't really care. But you have buried yourself so deep in work you can't see what's right in front of your face.

Whether she knows it or not, she's just trying to get your attention. And Matthew, bless his little heart, all he wants to do is grow up to be just like his dad. But you're never around to show him the way. -Are you finished? -I'm just getting started. Life is short, my friend. Unfortunately, you should know that better than anybody. One minute it can all be gone just like that. [snaps fingers] Mr. Bartilson, you have every right to fire me.

Now I'll go. Uh, this is the part where you're supposed to say, &quot;You're right, Ruby, I see the light. How can I ever thank you?&quot; [sighs] You are right, Ruby. I do see the light. And what was the last part? Uh, uh, &quot;How can I ever thank you?&quot; Why, I'd like to thank you by offering your job back, if you still want it, please. And I do apologize for being such a hothead last night. What can I ever do to make it up to you? Well, you can start by having dinner with your kids. Oh, geez, you know something? I've...uh I've got a client with a Christmas party that I'm, um... [Allison coughing] That I think I'm going to be too sick with the flu to attend. So, how about Alberto's at seven, my treat? You're on. Now, get back to work. I apologize for being so rude to you. [sighs] Excuse me. Ruby, I just want you to know I agree with you. Everything you said just now I've been trying to tell him for two years, but I never could have put it as well as you did. Well, one thing I'm known for is speaking my mind. Gets me in a heap of trouble though, let me tell you. Oh, is this your office? Mm-hm. Wow. Look at all these angels. They're beautiful. Thank you, I kind of have a thing for angels, I guess. They're all so different and unique. I love them all. I feel like they're watching over me. I always bring one back from wherever I travel and after a while people started giving them to me as gifts. You can never have too many angels looking out for you, I guess. [laughs] -[Ruby] Miss Meyers--- -[Allison] Call me Al. Everyone else does. Yeah, but you don't like that, do you? Oh, I'm used to it. Well, I'm going to call you Allison. -Okay. -So tell me, Allison, did you know Ben, you know, -before-- -Before Judy died? Yeah. Yeah, I wish you could have known him then. Ever since she got sick, he just kind of... I don't know. But he's a wonderful man and he's doing the best he can, he really is. Oh, I know his heart's in the right place. Oh, and he loves Sarah and Matthew so dearly. He's just afraid of getting close. To anyone. Ever again. You really care about him, don't you Allison? Oh, well, yes, of course I do. I mean, he's a dear friend and a colleague. But there's nothing, you know, more than that. [laughs] Yeah, well, excuse me. Well, that was a great idea, Ruby. That angel hair pasta was just fantastic. Yeah, I thought everything was divine. I thought you were going to say something at dinner. I want to wait until after Dad goes to bed. -Maybe we should just forget it. -No way. I think they really liked it. Wasn't that great? I mean, it's been a long time since we had a real family dinner together. - Dad. - Hmm? Since you're in such a good mood, I was wondering... Rachel and her family still want me to go skiing with them. [sighs] Let me get this straight. You were grounded, then you get arrested, and now you want to go skiing. Come on. So like you're going to hold this against me for the rest of my life? Great. I wish I was dead. Why didn't she just run me over with a dump truck? Because she knows this hurts more. [knocking on door] Sarah? It's Ruby, may I come in? Yeah. What's going on? How did you find this? The information superhighway and a little old fashioned footwork. Everybody thinks kids are so easy to fool. Ah, Mountain Examiner, River Hollow, Tennessee. River Hollow mourns the loss of songstress Ruby Diamond, 41, in an automobile crash. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. 41, let me see that. Where do they get off on saying I'm 41? I'm not a day over... Well, never mind that. I really like that songstress part. So I was right. You faked your own death. Now the only question is why. Obviously you're some kind of con artist. -Well now you can't-- -Unless you're a battered wife or something. She watches too much TV. It's the federal witness protection program, isn't it? All right, you got me. Uh, I confess. You see, this, uh, this nanny thing, it's just a cover and I'm just working here until the feds find me a safe place to live. I knew it. Wicked, who'd you squeal on? Well, I'm not allowed to talk about that. Of course she's not, dummy. Now, you two are not going to squeal on me, are you? I suppose I could be persuaded to play along. Oh, I can see the wheels turning in your little head right now. I won't tell dad anything about any of this. What's the catch? All you have to do is talk him into letting me go skiing with Rachel. You drive a hard bargain. What's wrong, Matthew? You just got here. I don't want you to go away. Oh well, I wish I didn't have to leave. But I have no choice. Am I crazy to think that she should be with her family for Christmas? Not certifiable. Look, it's been a long time since it felt like a family around here. Yeah, and I want to change that. I know you do, but it's a time in Sarah's life when so much is changing. I know how she feels. You go to the mirror every morning not knowing what you're even gonna look like. [Ben laughs] It's hard being a teenage girl, especially with no mother around to say this too shall pass. I can't be both mother and father. Well, be a father. But try to understand that without a mother, the next best shoulder to cry just might be her best friends. Yeah, you may be right. Okay, I'll let her go skiing. I'll tell her in the morning. Uh, Ben, do you mind if I ask you a personal question? Do you ever think about getting married again? What? Well, I think it's about time, don't you? Ah, getting married again is the farthest thing from my mind. I mean, I guess maybe if I met somebody someday. -Well maybe you've already met somebody. -What do you mean? Somebody smart, attractive, great personality, and your kids already love her. -Oh Ruby, I... -You know, sometimes what you're looking for can be right under your nose. [sighs] Ruby, I like you very much. I think you're a wonderful person, but-- Oh no, I didn't want you to think I-- Oh no, I didn't think. -You didn't? -No, did you think? No, I didn't think. Oh, well. Goodnight. [church bells chime] [dogs bark] [humming] I didn't know you were still up. I couldn't sleep. Me neither. You want some tea? Ben, I have a confession to make. Oh? I'm here under false pretenses. You see, I'm not really a nanny. I have never been nanny ever. I know. I've known all along. But why didn't you say something? [sighs] Ruby, you were so right about me. I've been afraid of my feelings. But not anymore. And I thought I was a free spirit. I've never wanted to be tied down to any one man before. But now... [alarm and cookoo clock going off, furniture shaking] All right, all right, Peter, I get the message. You're going to wake up the whole house. It was just a dream. I mean, I may be dead, but I'm not dead. Well, you know what I mean. [alarm and cookoo clock going off, furniture shaking] [Ben] Everything okay in there, Ruby? Everything's fine. You sure? I'm sorry for the noise. I had a dream and I knocked some stuff over. I'm perfectly fine, you go on back to sleep. Well, okay, goodnight then. Goodnight. Look what you did. I'm only human. A girl can dream, can't she? [Peter] Now you just listen to me, little Ruby. Where are you? [Peter] I don't think you fully appreciate your situation. ♪ [western music plays] ♪ I warned you about them rules. Now don't you getting so involved that you can't walk away. Just my luck. I finally meet the kind of man I can see spending the rest of my life with, and wouldn't you know it, I'm dead. I tell you, Allison is one of the most wonderful women I've ever met. She is so sweet and down to earth. Yeah, she's cool. Could you hand me one of those hooks please, hon? Sure. You know, she must have a zillion men running after her. But what I don't understand why your dad never grabbed her up. Why are you asking this? Well call me crazy, but I just had this feeling about your dad and Al. I thought maybe we might even try helping it along a little bit. Good grief, Allison, if that's how you feel how come you never said anything to Ben about it? He's been mourning his wife so long, it just never seemed appropriate. And then there's the whole work situation. You know, office romances can be pretty tricky and I'd never want to ruin our friendship, never. Well, you're probably right. I guess some things are just not meant to be. Ruby, how can you eat all that and still keep your figure? I can't, really. But where I'm going, it ain't going to matter what I weigh. Where are you going? Oh, it's a long story.

You had your chance and your time is up. I am sorry. Well, I won't be singing in that choir, then. Say hi to mama and papa and grandma too. And tell them I tried.

Hey, Matt. Hey. [takes a breath] Aren't you cold, tiger? Here. There we go. There. Missing mom, huh? I guess. You know what? I miss her too. -Really? -Yeah. But I thought if, you know...

The thing is, I love Allison too. It just took me a little while to realize it, that's all. Hey Matthew. Hi. We've uh, we've always been pals, you and I, haven't we? I know I'm not your mom. And I'm not going to try to be. But I would like to be your friend. 'Cause I love you so much and I love Sarah and I love your dad too. Is that okay? Buds? Come on now.

You've brought that family back together again. -Yeah, but-- -And just as important, you have learned to see beyond yourself. Now you know the joy that giving can bring. Uhh, that is all we ever wanted. Am I really going to get my wings after all? You were willing to give up everything. You have passed the supreme test. So you see, there's no need for tears. Unless they're tears of joy. Yeah, but isn't there some way I can... No. [laughing] It's true, it's true, it's very true. [Ben] Oh come, Matt, it's freezing. Matthew, where did you get that?
