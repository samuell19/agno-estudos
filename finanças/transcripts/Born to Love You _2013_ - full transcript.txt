In this world... everyone has their own worries. What do men worry about? Love, of course. Facing love troubles. Men have their own way of dealing with it. It's just that some appear exhausted by it. I miss you. Some appear to handle it well. Actually, your husband is not bad. The rest are simple and lovely. To those who never read my poems. Only you did not love me before. When you learn where I'm buried... I thought my love troubles disappeared 20 years ago with my first love. But they're back again after 20 years. The reason is I am unable to answer my own question. In this life... how many times can you find true love? Born To Love You One summer 20 years ago... a girl asked me... "Will you always love me?" I said "I will." Because of that answer... when I returned to this city after 20 years... I realised my worries are back. Good afternoon. Hello. Have you reached the hotel? I am tidying up. Is it convenient for me to drop by? To see the long lost Mr. Fang Jiacheng? You are a busy person yourself. It's too much for you to have to travel here for me. Let's meet up some other day. It sounds like you're rejecting me. How about dinner tonight? Tonight. I don't know. I'm meeting a difficult client. I'm afraid I can't take time out. Seems like our Mr. Fang Jiacheng is really an important person. Your majesty, please. Come, sit Your majesty, you are sitting on my proposal. Fang Jiacheng. Why do you stay in the same place every time you visit? Me, I'm just used to it. I like you being used to it. The emperor won't be happy if he sees this. I miss you. Actually, your husband is not bad. Hello, baby, what's the matter? I'm busy working. Grandma not taking you out to play? Is it because you misbehaved? Fine. I'll go with you after I finish my work, okay? All right. My baby is the most sensible of all. The most well-behaved child, right? Coming. Coming. Give them to me. Helped you save a few hundred dollars. Authentic cheap awesome service. Nice, right? Indeed. Suning's famous campus shopping agent. Great service, professional, well-branded. This is... so pretty. I knew good things were coming my way today. I thought my Prince Charming was coming. Prince Charming? Am I not right here? You animal. She said she'll have nothing to do with a "Leo". Her Prince Charming should be a "Virgo" born in August. My Prince Charming even saves me in times of distress. Other than giving me grief, when have you ever saved me? So, what could I do if the gangster didn't show up? Gangster, get in the car. Okay, coming! What's the matter? We have something on tonight. Not eating at home. Shenqi, look. This is the newly invented Shenqi number six. How come it's already number six? Turn around, turn around. Be careful of your neck. - I'm not tired. - I'm tired of looking at you. Both of you are so noisy, quiet down. How can you say that? Are you even human? What's wrong? - You should argue my father-in-law. - Who's your father-in-law? No. Uncle, uncle. Who's your uncle? Are you related? We're not related. Not even half a cent. I broke off all ties with him. He is just a little richer. Don't let me see him again. So proud just because you are rich? Why don't you just fly past! You'll lose your driving points! Don't drive so recklessly! I'm not called Zhonghuan the 13th for nothing! What's with your driving? - Are you okay? - Mister, what's your problem? Who's going to fix this? - There's someone-- - I'm coming, Shenqi. The hero is saving his maiden. It's none of your business. Let's talk about my car. What's wrong with you? What's wrong with you! Driving so fast without a licence. Don't you care about my life? Am I less important than your car now? What are you looking at? You know you hit our car? That's right. Kid, it looks like your car is in violation of the regulations. You wrecked my car door. What violation? You see that? I see it, tough guy. Kind of smart, pay up. Yes, pay up! Pay 600! Six-- Six-- Six hundred? - At least 1,000. - Yes, pay 1,000! I have no problem paying. But you hit my headlights. You need to pay too, at least 30,000. What? Thirty thousand? A British licence doesn't even cost 30,000, okay? Call the police then. You, show me your driving licence. Why should I show you? Unless you're driving without a licence. Who saw him driving? That's right. I was driving just now. You have bad eyesight. It's too much trouble to call the police for this small matter. Why don't we settle it privately? Is that possible? Shenqi. Fine. Type in your number. Wait. He's not hitting on her right for wanting her contact. This is Shenqi. Okay, I will keep your driving licence. We will settle this privately another day. What is he up to? Not decent at all. Luckily, we have Shenqi... to analyse it. What analyse? We have to pay him 30,000. He was quite handsome. Shenqi, what I did just now is considered a hero rescuing his maiden, right? - It's not Little Li, not Little Li. - Shut up! It's not Little Li who kicked it open. It counts this time, right? How come they're all in the car already? Liu! Get some cables or rope from the trunk. What do you mean? I rushed here just to meet you. You just left without saying a word? Ling, honestly. At first, I really thought your husband was no match for me. But I've realised... there's not one but two men by your side. Both of them bought life insurance. You are the insurer. They are the beneficiaries. So some of the things we did... are bad and inappropriate. But we're still friends. Me, such an important chapter in your life... just being wiped away like that? I told you three years ago, some things are meant to be wiped away. Life is like frying an egg. After you fry one side, there's still another side. What about you? You like yours fully cooked. I like mine half-cooked. All this while you're trying to persuade me. I thought you were talking about yourself. Then can you tell me? How many times can you find true love in life? Looking at you, you can only love one person in your lifetime. - Hello. - Mr. Fang Jiacheng is here. Okay, show him in. Fang Jiacheng, one of DOP's best investment advisors. Can't believe that I got you to Shanghai this easy. You are a smart person. So I will be frank. Instead of choosing the right investment company, why not get the right advisor? Once the right one's been chosen, why not convert him into the company's own advisor? I am into real business. Always wanted to have my own financial firm. I invited you to Shanghai... to ask you if you are interested in becoming the CEO of my company. You are from Shanghai. I'm sure you want to come back. And I understand your boss has some negative opinions about you. Sometimes being a high performer is not a good thing. I bought a guitar once. Used up one and a half months of my allowance. This Martin D40... is made of Indian rosewood. Worthy of the four words, "The course of time". It's a shame there's so much dust on it. So you're saying... I have my own investment firm in Shanghai. I am not interested in working for you. But to be your partner, I am more than happy. When I have the time, I will visit you at your company. You're welcome anytime. You've still got it. Twenty years of craftsmanship... did not go to waste. Those who played went on to sell ducks. Since when did you become a music critic from selling alcohol? Our Red Star Society lead singer. Ever thought of going back to singing? Didn't I already say? It doesn't matter who it's for, I won't be singing any more. You won't consider it at all? I placed your guitar together with one from the Beatles. Where did you get that? Online. Grade A product. If you don't tell, who will know it's autographed? Your boyhood signature forging skills did not go to waste. Yes, let me tell you. So many legends around you. You can see how important you are to me. Thank you for your love. Over time there are always separations and reunions. Tonight, let's drink! How can I go to sleep tonight? There's a sad song playing Dislocation of you and him You're really bold to do that. I want to risk it. Risk that he doesn't have the time. I saw his schedule on the table. After our discussion, he went to dinner with his girlfriend. Then headed to Liu Xiang's game. Tomorrow morning, he'll be flying to Europe for two weeks of meetings. But honestly... Hong Kong... I can't stay there much longer. I have to take this risk. Right. When did you own a company? That's why I need your help, my amazing Brother Hui. Tomorrow as soon as possible, help get me an office, okay? - Get in a few guys... - That's right. - Get a sign. - Yes. You really are something. No one can go to sleep tonight Requiem sounds too ghostly The script ends magnificently Hurry up. We're running late. Shouldn't have come. What an unlucky day. I didn't say we'd be performing. I knew we would. My lucky stars are shining on me. Don't speak too soon, Ms. prophet. If you're that good, you should have seen what was coming this afternoon. That's right. Accidents can be a blessing in disguise, blessings can be an accident in disguise. What do you mean? Layman terms, please. It means get the money ready for the repair work. He still has my driving licence. It's not-- I-- It's because of you. You should take responsibility for it. No-- Why are you all ganging up on me? Little Li. Don't look at me. I am not going to ask my dad for money. What did I do? Brother Hui. Brother Hui. Brother Hui. It's me, Shenqi. Listen to me. Listen to me. We are really ready this time. Really. To show our sincerity, we've changed our band's name to "Red Star Society II" Red-- Red Star Society? Neat. Get up on stage. All of you. Hi, everybody, we are Red Star Society II! We'll bring you some oldies today. Maybe I don't know much Maybe it's my fault Maybe everything is slowly missing Nautical striped shirt. High ponytail. Does she look like your girl? Uncertainty Always remembering our promises Acting impulsively over and over again Don't break my heart Be gentle again Don't want your silence Waiting alone Suffering quietly Joy always appears in my dreams You have your body Attractive beauty I have my memories Wonderful feeling My baby Red Star Society II. Neat! Don't hold me. What's taking you so long? Go see a doctor when you have time. I'm going outside. That's somebody's seat. Leave. I am somebody. This is for the bands only. Just leave. I am one of the bands. Why can't you just leave? What are you doing? It's the choir. We have been waiting for you. Please have a seat. Love and peace, love and peace. Got it? Tough guy. Fatty. There's a difference between two fat guys. Step aside. Why should we make way? Calm down. Hold on. We will get them when Liu comes back. They outnumber us. We're at a disadvantage. You see it coming again? I don't have to, I can see that. They are the Red Star Society II. A bunch of idiots. You! Crazy! Are you okay? Apologise! Now! Apologise? Stop dreaming. Watch out if you don't. Liu. Liu. Wake up. Opportunity for you to save your maiden! - Shenqi is being threatened. - Shenqi! - Get up! - Shenqi! I'm coming! Hit me if you dare! You are not a man if you don't hit me now. I'll show you the man I am. Hit me? Hit him! - What's the matter? - What are you doing? Drunk? Call Brother Fang. Call him! Brother Fang, Brother Fang. Don't mind these kids. Let me tell you. Don't let me hear anything bad about Red Star Society II from now on, okay? Sorry. And don't let me see you threatening this bunch of kids. They are members of the Red Star Society. This is Red Star Society territory, understand? - Understand? - Got it? Lead singer of Red Star Society. Fang Jiacheng. Remember. Zhang Jiacheng? Let me tell you. You guys-- No concussion, just drunk. He can leave when he is sober. Let's go. Why are you still standing there? The doctor said he's fine. Let's go. Li. The Prince Charming I told you about. He's here. Prince Charming? What? ID, please. - Officer I just pushed a little. - Be serious! Just one push and he fell? I think both of you are dishonest, especially you. Ms. Officer. Don't listen to him. We didn't do anything. As for how he fell... you have to ask his girlfriend. The one with the high ponytail. Girl with the ponytail. Come out here. Is that your boyfriend in there? Yes. What's his name? Fang Jiacheng. A Virgo from Shanghai. - Aunty! - Jiacheng! Oh, my goodness. What happened to you? - Sit down. Sit down. - What happened? Nothing, nothing. Mum, why are you here? Why didn't you tell me you were back? You even got into a fight and now you're in the hospital. Mum, I wasn't fighting. I'm in Shanghai for work. Just drank too much. He's right. Aunty, he's telling the truth, I guarantee it. Aunty, I'll tell you some good news. Jiacheng won't be living in Hong Kong for much longer. He's coming back and setting up his company here. - Not leaving any more. - What? Don't listen to him. I'm fine. It's fine, it's fine. Why are you so clumsy? I didn't see it. - How is it? Are you okay? - I'm fine. You, stop pretending. Trying to change the subject? What happened in Hong Kong? Work may not be that smooth, but to set up a company in Shanghai? You know it's not that easy. What happens if you're unlucky and the company doesn't do well? Are you going to live on welfare in Shanghai? You're not a kid any more. Think twice before you act. Is she your girlfriend? Come here. Mum, this is Shenqi. My girlfriend. Mum, I came back, so you could meet her. Smooth talker. Girl, how old are you? Eighteen. Eighteen? Shenqi really is something. Fooled the cops with some fortune-telling crap. Made it sound so real, and the Virgo thing. That's nonsense, when did he become a Virgo? Didn't you see his looks? Thick brows, big eyes, and dimples when he smiles. Yes, Liu. They're having a family reunion. Let's go... Ms. Officer. Just take me. Really, I hit him. You, staying in a hotel instead of your own home. I won't forgive you. Mum. We are loud in bed. We're afraid we might disturb you. Don't tell me this. Look at the two of you, not serious at all. Find time. Find time and come home for a meal. You know why I was named Shenqi? Because I am magical. My mum told me when I was born it was snowing in June and the earth changed. Something fell from the sky that was the size of an egg. Little liar. Don't play tricks on me. My mum hates stuff like that. Yes, old man. When you're in a relationship, do you call your boyfriend old man? I've never been in a relationship. Listen. From now on we are a couple. So don't look down when I am talking to you. Look at me. Eyes full of passion. Of course, you have to stand and sit properly. Old man, you have quite high standards. Don't call me old man. Actually, it sounds nice. In Korean dramas, they say, "Oppa, Oppa." It means brother. But it doesn't seem right for your age. The most important thing as my girlfriend is to be obedient. Don't talk back, okay? Remember, I am an investment advisor. I did not resign and I am not unemployed. I am working in Hong Kong. I came to Shanghai for work. And for you to meet my parents, understand? What if they ask how we met? What should I tell them? What is your major? Accounting. Tell them you met me doing an internship. What did I do during this internship? That is photocopying of documents. What a low position. I am your girlfriend. What? Not satisfied? You are an investment advisor. I'm just photocopying documents. Isn't that embarrassing? Very good. Starting to love your boyfriend. Fast learner. Here you go. I have always been good at learning. Fine, let me ask you. If you have a bunch of fruit. They start rotting. What do you do with them? Discount them, sell them quickly at a lower price. You need to act quickly. People like me, we'd cut up the fruit into a fruit platter and sell it at 30 times higher the price. So little liar... photocopying documents is suitable for you. You dare say I'm a liar. I have a question for you. I'm sure you can't figure this out. Do you know what half of this is? Think it through. Bill, please. I have to go. You keep eating. We'll continue this some other day. Leaving just like that? Not even asking if I want to order something else? I am Shenqi, 18 years old. Fourth year in senior high, Cancer. Excuse me. hotel INDIGO You're still here? Where's your car? I think you know. That's because your car is lousy. We are still driving ours. You won't get a taxi here. Why not hop on? Let me tell you. It may look a little messy, but after some tidying, it's a good space. These cupboard and couch are on the house. The first floor is full of bugs and damp. Normally, people in Shanghai are reluctant to stay here. What's wrong with the first floor? It's got a green view, a great view. You're not packed into the elevator during peak hours. Not to mention renting a house is about the location. This is the best location in Shanghai. Facing the huge Song Qingling Park. Highway at the back, convenient transportation. Where else can you find such a good location? Don't act like you know if you don't. Aunty, if this is such a good place, then our studio is even better. We face Henglong Plaza and at the back is Yanan highway. Petrol station on the left, TV station on the right. Right in the centre of the city. It's a converted warehouse and the feng shui is good. You even know about feng shui? People who do great things... should master everything. Little liar. Only good at superstitions. What loft and warehouse? You are overdoing it. Listen, don't create any trouble. It's true. Our studio is quiet and fully functional. We have areas for practising and working, and a lounge. The key is we have a huge Red Star Society logo hanging in front of our studio. Do you know how much is it per square metre? That's right. In the whole of Shanghai, the price of this building is the highest. If it weren't for Hui, I wouldn't offer it to you at this price. If you don't believe me, you can go compare it with the others. But let me tell you once compared... - Hello. - Where are you? I'm in the office finishing up something. That's great, I am heading there now. My flight's been delayed and I was thinking about where to go. Send me your address. See you later. Bye. How much is it per month? Are you the one renting? 3.5 Renminbi per square metre per day. Have you not rented a house before? Is it true that your office has everything? What I said we have should be. Demolish When are you demolishing your luxurious practise room? We drew it ourselves, cool, right? Your warehouse is neat indeed. What do you think about this place? This place... I think... We used to be students. What did we want most as students? A decent job? No. A job that earns a lot? No. We wanted freedom. Where we could earn freely. And a place where we could work freely and happily. We had this dream, they have it too. I want them to live their dream today... and for myself too. I have been working hard for others for 20 years. I have been in different companies. My office gets higher and higher. The view gets wider and further. But I am still a bird in a cage. I once asked myself. Why do I have to hide? Why do I have to live with such exhaustion? Why can't I just be myself? I finally realised. It's not important where you work... or what you do or how much you earn. The most important is to be yourself. Do what you love. Office area. Media area. Entertainment zone. What I imagined a company should have are all here. As for how it looks, I don't care at all. Okay! I like it here. Come here. Next time, I come here for the signing of the contract, could you clean it up a little? We are not short of money. - That's right. - I still have something to do. Next round. We will sign the contract for sure. This might actually work. It's done. You've got Shenqi. We helped by being your staff. But if you wish to continue lying to that rich guy, I am sorry, but this space is ours. Without the word "Demolish"... I can make this warehouse mine. This is our rehearsal hall! Mr. Fang. We can work this out. I will prepare the rental agreement. All of you continue to work for me. And cover for me. You studied accounting. You should know how to analyse reports and create data. After the deal is closed, you can continue working here. Monthly salary is five thousand. Satisfied? The salary... sounds good. But we are musicians. We can't finish work too late. It will delay our practise. Work from 9:30 to 3:30. After the stock trading, you can continue practising here. And I will get Hui to let you perform. But within a week you need to give me a well-equipped and neat office. Can you guys do that? As long as we have the money, we can even get you a tank. I'm just afraid you guys can't deliver by then. You know what this is? Just afraid your credit ain't enough. Good. I will cover all the upgrades. Why didn't you mention anything about Shenqi? Fang Jiacheng, I'm warning you, she's just acting as your girlfriend. If there's nothing else, tomorrow you... you and you start working. What? Why only the three of us? Because I'm bringing my girlfriend home for dinner. Diary of the fair lady... Understood. Get out, start your work, hurry up! It's time to say goodbye. But humans are sentimental. Why don't we start instead of letting them? So macho. Bottoms up. I should give you a bowl instead. You say I'm your girlfriend, but you keep finding fault. Since when have you treated me like one? I'll let you experience what it's like to be my girlfriend. Stop, you guys, I'm trying to order. What do you guys want? I want the latest household appliances. Food, drinks, video games and a massage chair. The latest office furniture. Demolish Hello. This is Suning purchasing customer service. This is about the products you ordered from our website. The estimated delivery time is 2:00 to 4:00 tomorrow afternoon. Kindly take a note of the delivery. Got it, thank you. So fast? I want a decent, well-behaved temperament. A well-mannered lady. You can trust me, handsome. Make online shopping more enjoyable Shenqi chose this for you. It's a 1992 red wine. Don't waste your money. Your dad shouldn't drink that much. You've brought her home. I am very happy. Aunty, this wine is good. It's two years older than I am. You are 1994... I'm 18, senior high, 4th year, Cancer. What, what, what Cancer? She means, "I was born at the end of June 1994." You're 20 years younger than Jiacheng. I thought you were only 10 years apart. Actually, it's nothing, it's a trend now. That's right. Young with old. Come. Let's toast to that. Okay. Seems like you don't like red wine. I'm okay. Let me bring the white wine. Red wine is not satisfying enough. You promised. White wine is only for festive occasions. It's a happy day today. Our son brought his future wife home. It's the happiest of occasions. You just can't control yourself. You keep looking for excuses and reasons. You keep looking for chances. What if I drink with uncle? Just a little. It's a happy day. Good! Good! Good? Good? Just this once. Change the glasses. You old man. This girl is steady. Drinking red wine is not satisfying enough. I don't like red wine either. Too sour. I'd rather drink grape juice. - Come. - Enough, enough. Enough. No more after this. Tone it down. Thanks to me, your dad is so happy. Keep your cool. - Sit up. - They can't even see. Sit up. Enough drinking. I just started. One last one, okay. One last one, one last one, always one last one. It's a happy day today. - Stop drinking, you hear me? - Have some soup, uncle. Okay, thank you. I will drink this. Cheers! It's finished. You picked a good wine. Mum, right? I forgot to ask you. How did you two meet? Me? I was his secretary. Intern, intern... Intern. Do you have any family in Hong Kong? No, Mum and I have always lived in Shanghai. Then how could you be an intern at his company? I... Our company is setting up a branch in Shanghai soon. She helped me in Shanghai. Very professional. That's great. Meaning you can come back? Why do you ask so many questions? Your boss will decide. Right, right, right. Uncle, you look so young. I'm old! Not at all. You have dark hair. I can't even tell your age. Aunty, your hair-dying skills are good. Can't even see that you have lots of white hair. What? Nothing to be embarrassed about. People our age. If we still had dark hair, it wouldn't be natural, right? True. Yes, yes, yes. I colour my hair to make it look better. Come on, eat some more. Let's eat, eat, eat. Stop drinking. If Mum finds out, I'll tell her it was you. I was watching you during dinner. You kept whispering to her. Didn't even look at me or your mum. What, too romantic for you? It's good you've found someone you like. It doesn't matter if it's a new company or a branch... but if it brings you back here. Sometimes you can't see the future until you let go of the past. I've been wanting to ask you but was afraid you'd be shy. You and him... Aunty, my parents are strict. I have to be home by 5:00 and in bed by 10:30. There's really nothing between us. That's not what I meant. I was just asking how long have you known each other? We've actually known each other for quite some time. Quite some time? But you said you were an intern? Even though I'm an intern... I feel like I've known him forever. It's like me growing up just to meet him one day. And spend the rest of our lives together. The young generation now are so romantic. Aunty, this looks expensive. I can't take that. Not at all. How much can it cost? Let me tell you. To keep a man's heart is the most important thing. Here, let me help you. Come. I can't believe you have such a big appetite. It's all your fault. I normally don't eat this much. Right, I thought the goddess knew what was coming? Just bragging. You shouldn't always trust me. What time were you born? 3:15 in the morning. Why? August 27, 1971, 3:15 in the morning. Sun Virgo, moon Scorpio, ascendant Leo. Venus Virgo, Mercury Virgo, Mars Libra. You strive for success. Stubborn and never admit defeat. Very talented. Especially in music. Destined to leave home at the age of 21. Worked hard for years. Did you fall in love with a woman before? A man like me. If I'd never fallen in love before, would you think that's normal? Give it to me. What? The necklace. How can you take it back! Hold it tighter, tighter! Really feel like it's strangling you. You were either too quiet or you talked too much at home tonight. I haven't called you out on that yet. Your parents were so happy with me. Happy? Your act is over. We've known each other a long time. I want to spend the rest of my life with him. Is that what a normal person says? My skins crawls just thinking about it. You heard? Little liar. Don't change the topic. Give me back the necklace. It's just a necklace, right? Get it yourself. I will. What are you doing? Fine, keep it. Thank you. You'll pay with your body. You pervert. I said I want to try the chicken. Pass me one. Shenqi! Mum. You're not at home and you're messing around with this guy? - I am not messing around. - Aunty, you misunderstand. Aunty? How old are you? There's really nothing between us. You think I'm blind. Listen. I got some money from your aunt. I will send you overseas to study. I don't think you are studying here. Always performing. Not just that. You're in a relationship at such a young age? And with an older man? Are you looking for a son-in-law or a husband for me? - He is not my boyfriend. - Then who is he? He bought you clothes, jewellery, shoes. Return everything to him tomorrow. Shenqi. I know we are poor. But we can't be with people like that just for money. - How is he not a good guy? - How is he good! Why is he buying you expensive gifts? Sure, he's thinking of getting something in return. Tell me. Did you already-- With him? Am I right? Tell me! There's nothing between us. That's it! I knew it, he forced you. He didn't. Stop assuming! Am I? Why do you keep protecting him? You don't know how I feel. I, I will punish you on behalf of your dad. For not teaching you well enough. Don't think I will stop even if you're not avoiding it. You think I will stop? He has nothing to do with this. It's me. I like him. I've liked him for a long time. Red Star Society "Old man, "I can't do this anymore, we need to talk about the payment."" Are you okay, Liu? Hold on. Big Qing, you keep bullying Liu. What's wrong? Not happy? I'm fine. Tell me. To cheer me up. My mum wants me to go study in Australia. It's okay. If you really don't want to go. Your mum can't do anything about it. Can you? You lost it. Come here. Are you reluctant to leave us or your Prince Charming? Both. You are really serious! You're heartless. Why are you so weak today? - I'll make a deal with you. - What? If you get this, you call the shots. - I'll let you kiss Shenqi. - Really? Li Liu is going to shoot. Let him kiss Shenqi, okay? Sure. Stop fooling around. I'll hold her for you. I tell you, if you make the shot, come get your kiss. I'm coming, Shenqi. Can you do it, Liu? Again. I haven't played for so long. You guys. You and you, don't play too late. Fang Jiacheng, you made the shot. Want a kiss? Fang Jiacheng! You are lousy. Again. You think he heard what we said? He left after making the shot. How could he? I don't know. Who are you? Get out of here! Don't scare your father. This is my new girlfriend. Your future step mum. I always thought I had the world's best dad. But I hate him so much now. Rich man's game. They use their money for girls and relationships. I hate those women who knew and still wanted to be with him. They hoped to get some money out of it. After they're dumped... they can only cry alone. Did you hear a word I said? Shenqi. Are you talking about Fang Jiacheng? All rich man are the same. Fang Jiacheng? It's better not to get involved in some games. It's not what you think. At least I'm not. Prince Charming Virgo. You take that for real? How long have you known him? Yes, he presents himself very well. Sorry, but it's all years of experience. If he really likes a person, he will treat her right. Did you hear what I said? What treat her right? If you think Fang Jiacheng is an exception, then give it a go. Do you know why he stopped singing? His ex died in a car crash. He was driving. He is a loyal person. You never listened to his songs but I did. My first cassette was his first live recording. I bought my first guitar because of him. I grew up listening to his voice. Hoping that one day I'd be his girlfriend. And be loved by him for the rest of my life. Li, if you were me... what would you do if this person appeared? Does he know? Does he like you? I don't know. If he really likes you, then he should sing again. Sing for you. But if he refuses... then just forget about him. - Hello? - If you still don't show up, we will jump in the river! - Hello? - Fang Jiacheng, I like you! Say again... Did you hear? - Shenqi says she likes you! - Where are you? Did you hear? - I can't hear you. - Fang Jiacheng! I like you! Old man, I want an ice cream. Can you buy me one? Where can I get ice cream this late? You don't love me anymore. Just because I'm not getting you ice cream? How can I make it up? Carry me and give me ice cream. You're a strange girl. I won't tell you where I live if you don't get me ice cream. I can still find it. I'm going to sleep. She's drunk. This is my mum. She hates you. Let me help you. Okay, okay. No need. I can manage. I don't want to go home! I don't want to! Go home. Come over for dinner if you have time tomorrow. You up? Mum... Sorry I got home late last night. At least you still remember it. Hurry up, take a shower. He's coming for dinner tonight. Who? Who? He brought you home last night. You don't remember? Luckily, he didn't do anything to you. Mum, get out, get out! Get out, get out. - Take your shower, embarrassing! - Yes, yes, yes, yes. Pass the ball. - You stink. - You stink. Don't cheat. Look at my defence. Long pass. I will end you. That's it, that's it. Shoot. Yes! You're leaving? Keep entertaining our guests. We will celebrate after the performance tomorrow. Why don't you sing a song too? What are you looking at? Sing for Shenqi. Bye-bye. Slowly. Shenqi. Help me. Okay. Hello. Are you coming soon? The food is getting cold. Shenqi. Can you tell me? In this life... how many times can you find true love? Try some. There, there. Darn it! Not only did he fool us into helping him with the company, but he misled Shenqi too. He is the biggest liar of all time. I will get him today, I swear it! We will do a celebration for him tonight. You just need to say... go and we'll smash him. If it's no go, then from now on, you forget him for good. Go. Liu. Get your stuff! You came so early. Come, Ling, sit. How are you, boss? Long time, no see. Am I a big boss now? Drink this. Of course. We received three million in investments with you partnering for only a short time. From now on you are Red Star Society's brightest star. Ling, how do you plan to celebrate? No gifts? Should have bought one. She's here. Isn't that the best gift? Cheers. Right. Just like our relationship. It's always under his control. Why are you taking her drinks? Slow down. Your girlfriend will be here soon. What girlfriend? Come on, Ling. Who's the lucky girl? I really don't remember I have a girlfriend. I forgot too, I'll drink to that. Right. Boss Fang has so many girls in his life. Besides, Lan, he won't remember anyone. I always remember you. Do you? Should I thank you for that? - It's an honour. - Thank you. You're welcome. A person who can't forget the past... shouldn't get others involved in your mess. Don't you know that? I know. That's why I ended it. Ended it? You knew you couldn't offer anything. So why even start! I didn't start it with you. What's with you two? Both of you are drunk. Ling. This is supposed to be a happy day. You haven't sung since Lan passed away. The band fell apart too. Don't live in the past. This is not only meant for you, Fang Jiacheng. But for you too, Ling. Fang Jiacheng. Your girlfriend is here. Shenqi? This song... is dedicated to a very special person. Believe it or not. I want to let you know. I've really known you for a long time. And I really like you. For so long that you don't even remember. But it's okay, as long as I remember. I've been waiting for this day. Hoping to sing this song to you. And you will tell me... "Shenqi, let me sing you a song too." Look, look at the endless road Just want to hold your hand Smile with you Lights are flashing You and me walking in silence Listen, listen to the silence If silence is a promise Don't be sad Although there's only wind It's like you are saying you love me If we met earlier and grew Old together No kisses or hugs But we still rely on each other But if you met Someone better than me I can only greet you from afar Though I can't tell you personally We, Red Star Society, dare to love. You should sing a song for her. If you don't... don't ever come here again. Don't want to say goodbye But if I let go I managed to set you free If we met earlier and grew Old together No kisses or hugs But we still rely on each other But if you met someone Better than me I can only greet you from afar Though I can't tell you personally If we met earlier and grew Old together Kisses and hugs are gone Even if you met someone Better than me I will still greet you And tell you personally Shenqi. I love you! I know. All these years, I am just a replacement for Lan. I knew that. Ling... I'm sorry. Don't be. You know why? Because I love you so much. I really do. I can fool myself. But Shenqi can't. You know her? Yes. I knew her a long time ago. She was my neighbour's daughter. She liked to go places. And she liked playing with me. I treated her like my little sister. So what she sang on stage just now. That she'd known you for so long. Liked you. It's the truth. No wonder she knows so much about me. That's why. Little liar. Shenqi liked my stories. Through your songs... I told her about us. Maybe I loved you too much. So no matter how the story changed... you were always the hero. Brave and strong. Girls like to dream. I think it was then... that she fell in love with you. I remember before my marriage... I was clearing up some stuff. And she took them home. Now thinking back, maybe it's because of you. So don't call her a liar. She's liked you since then. I used to think when will he be back. How will he be then? I wanted to be on stage so badly. If he really comes back one day, he might remember me. I guess I am just fooling myself. These were my memories. I need to grow up. I know it's difficult to forget just like that. Instead of dragging it on... why not just end this now. Forget the past. Mum. All done. You're a big girl now. I won't be seeing you off. Remember to call me when you get there, okay? Goodbye. Brother, I need your help. Men of certain age... should know what to do. You didn't show up the other day. You shouldn't have come today. I don't know how she feels. But I... I miss her when I don't see her. I thought I could let go. But I really can't. She's left for Pudong Airport. Three o'clock flight to Australia. Fang Jiacheng sent you a WeChat message This is my new invention, Shenqi number seven. I will continue to develop music products about you. I'll wait for you to come back. - Thank you. - Take care. We'll wait for you. Go. There's nothing to miss here. No prevention No concern You appear In my world Bring me surprises Unconsciously But you Without me realising it Quietly disappeared From my world Without a word Only memories You are Deep in my mind In my dreams In my heart In my song You are Deep in my mind In my dreams In my heart In my song Remember we used to Walk side by side On the busy road We were strangers Passersby But we both felt Each other's emotions Heartbeat Unexpected happiness Is like a dream Destiny Shenqi! Hey, hey, hold him. Leave. Why are you here? Leave. You want me to hit you? Go, go, go. Leave. 128?å¡„98a I LOVE YOU You are Deep in my mind In my dreams In my heart In my song I want ice cream. I want ice cream. You can't. What if you get a stomachache? Your mum will blame me. Right? Let's take a picture. Sure. Old man Translated by: SDI Media
