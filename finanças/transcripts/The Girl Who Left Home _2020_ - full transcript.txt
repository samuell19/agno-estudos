And I'll see you tomorrow morning, with Nanay. Love you, bye. (phone beeps) - [Megan] Hey girl. Yes! Come over. I cannot believe you haven't called me this whole time. I'll be awake. I'll be up and ready. I'll see you soon, okay? So excited to see you! Bye! (phone beeps) - [Christine] Thank you. Have a good night. (car door closes) (gentle music) (doorbell rings) (door opens) - Girl, you didn't call me once. - I know Megan. I'm sorry. - Okay fine. Get in. It's freezing out. - I know my bones are like-- (shivers) (door closes) (gentle music) (car honking) - [Woman] Woo, go girl! (gentle music) (phone ringing) - Why aren't you answering your phone? We're gonna be so late. - I wanted to get coffee at Syriana's. I'm so glad they reopened after the flood. - Get in, get in. Now we're gonna be on "Filipino Time" and your mom will be super pissed. (car door closes) Nice coat. - Oh, thanks, it's yours. Baklava? (bag rustles) - Give me that baklava. - I knew it. - Let's roll.

(footsteps thudding) - [Bess] Hello, hello, sweetie! How are you? - Hi Auntie Bess. - Oh my goodness. I'm so sorry for your loss. My God, I cannot even imagine just not waking up one morning? No warnings, that's scary! You never know what's going to happen. - [Tony] All holy bishops, confessors and-- - Honey! What is thi-- Your sweater is all ripped! Ano ba yan? (My goodness) Do you need money? I heard it is hard to be an artist. I read it all over Facebook. I have a twenty in here somewhere. Teka. Oh here, my secret hiding place. - You take this. No, no, no, no, no, no. - Tito is giving me money-- - Don't be shy. - It's okay. - Don't be shy. - (Speaking foreign language) That's for you. Get something. So... Are you staying here now? - Oh no, I'm just visiting. I landed a lead role in a show in L.A. So, I have to get back soon. - Really? - Well, sayang, because Amy is having a party next week but, that's fine, I know you two are still not talking. - Yeah, but I mean, I'm not mad at her or anything anymore-- - You know, you really should patch things up. You know, I hate to see you girls fighting after all you've been through together. You know, you should not be fighting. - Auntie Bess, hi! - Oh, look at you! So chic! - Oh wow! Look at these beads! - Oh, you like? Life doesn't stop fashion, right girls? (Bess laughs) So anyway, I was telling Christine about Amy's party next week. Do you remember how your girls used to perform all the time, when you were younger? You were only this high, and you were inseparable. You remember that? - It's so sweet. - Auntie Bess, I saw a plant over there that I really wanted to ask you about. - Okay, go ahead. It's over here. - Okay. Okay. One second. Okay. Christine. I know we're not blood, but I have always considered you like a daughter to me. So you call me anytime, okay? Anytime. (kisses) - You be strong, ha? Strong. - Auntie Bess it's that way. - What's good? What's good? What's good? - Tito! (Christine chuckles) Oh my God. Your hair! - Gotta be on fleek. - What's wrong with your voice? - I want to be like Bruno Mars. He's hot, right? - Oh my God. - I'm still in the market to find a babe. Forty-five and kicking! (urn clatters) (gasps) I guess your dad wants to go to heaven. He's trying to fly. Sorry, you couldn't see him before we cremated him. - Why isn't he having a proper burial? - I don't know. Your mom just insisted him being cremated. - I think I have to get back to L.A. I'm scared I might lose my part. - Stop thinking about that stuff! This is about family. Your parents weren't the same after that fight. Especially your mom. I can come back for the funeral. - We'll talk about that later, okay? Right now you need to talk to your mom. It's like she's been living with a ghost for a year. And now she actually has to live with a ghost. - Tito! - Sorry, sorry. I'll stop. - Anak! I'm so glad you came. You're coming home with me, right? - Well, yeah. - Okay. Sige, let's go. You drive, I wanna hear about your stories. Tony, there's more food over there, ha? - Hoy! Take your dad with you. (playful music) - [Mary] And then you keep going straight, You know how to get home. There's a lot of police that go around here, so you watch the speed limit. - Yes, Nanay. - Wow. It's gorgeous today, huh? - Yeah, it's so pretty. - Why aren't you wear your coat? - Oh, I gave it back to Megan. It was hers. - Ay nako, it's so cold. My bones are like-- (urn clatters) - Hoo! (clicks) (air blows) - I do really miss the warm weather back home. - Home? You're already home. - Oh, sorry, I meant L.A. - L.A.? You've only been there 10 months, two weeks and five days. - Wait, you counted to the day? - Of course. Every day wake up, wondering how you're doing. You don't call! So how am I supposed to know? I just see you on YouTube, on Facebook. - Yes, okay, but I'm on stage now. Not just on Facebook and YouTube. - I thought you want to be on TV. - I do, but I've just been getting luckier in theater. Mom, I just landed a lead role in a new musical in development for Broadway. - One year later and only now getting a chance to twirl and twirl on stage, not on TV? This is why you abandon me? - Woah, abandoned? - Anak, you leave and didn't even say goodbye. - Mom, I'm here. For you. - And your dad? Huh? (urn rattles) - Please don't shake it like that, it might spill. - Christine Anna -Maria Santos. Are you telling me you don't even care about your dad? - Mom, I care! Okay, but we left terribly. The few years before I left we-- - So what about a few years? He sacrificed so much to get us here. It was his whole life, and now he's gone. You can't even be thankful for-- Anak! (tires screeching) (urn clatters) - [Woman] Watch it! (gags) - Just don't move. We'll pour him back in the urn. (gentle music) (vaccuum whirring) (footsteps approaching) - [Tony] What happened? - He flew. First she was happy and then suddenly she's mad at me now? I'm so confused. - Don't take it so hard. Her husband, your father, just passed. - I just don't understand why they think performing is a bad thing. We used to sing all the time, and it's like, now they're embarrassed of me for wanting to do it for real? It doesn't make sense. - You know, your mom was a great singer. Back in the Philippines, when we washed the clothes, fed the cocks. - Do you mean chickens? - Yeah, the cock-a-doodles. She would sing all the time. And the little cocks would follow her around. - Oh my God, Tito stop saying that. - What? - You know what! - Cocks are chicken. - It's not on fleek. - Well, your mom used to sing all the time. Even when she had you, especially when baking. Remember? (Singing in foreign language) (laughs, high fives) - I forgot how much we loved to bake. I should make her pan de sal. Oh yeah, she's gonna love that. (bags rustling) - Hey, would you mind stopping by the restaurant tomorrow to fill in for your mom? - What? Tito, what about me leaving for my show? We talked about this. - Please Chrissie. It'll help me out. It'll help your mom out. - Look Tito, I don't wanna work at the restaurant. I left everything for this. Okay, people who've been doing it longer than I have didn't get the part, I did. I don't want people to forget that I exist. - Chrissie. I don't ask you to do things often. But the right thing to do is to come back and be here for your mom, for your dad. - Going back there-- It was the last-- The last time I saw... - I know it's going to be hard Christine, but we need you. - I'm not going back there. I'm not ready. - Just think about it.

There's a lot of talk about the big money producers coming in this week and I highly recommend that you get there. And if they see your understudy and like her, they might keep her.

Anyway, I need to change the name tags of the food. - What buffet? - The buffet. - We serve buffet now? - We've always served buffet. - No we didn't. - Yes we did. - Since when? - Since forever. - I'm sorry. Claire? You're great. But no, we haven't served buffet since forever, we serve à la carte. - What's that? - How long have you been working here? - One month. - Pancit, adobo chicken, dinuguan, lumpia beef and vegetable, fried tilapia, arroz caldo, menudo and kutsinta for dessert. - Got it. - Since when did we start serving buffet? - Since after you left. - But there's no art in that. - Art? What are you talking? It's sharing. Like back home where we would eat from the same pot. - Tito, you have to pay attention to each one, so that it's specially made for a specific person. A buffet is so general. You clump it up like lunch meat and the flavors mix like caca! - You like a spam? - Yes. - You like Vienna sausage? - Yes. - Same difference. - But our food can be better than that. It is better than that! - Come over here. (staff whispers) (door opens) This is not L.A. Christine. When you left, we couldn't replicate the way that you made the food look. You know, for the Insta-betch. - The what? - The Insta-betch. You take a picture on Instagram and it goes viral. And then people go, "It's on Insta beetch." - No one says that. - I heard some girl use it when she was taking a picture of our halo-halo. - Yeah, I think we should take the time to review all the slang you've learned since I've been gone. - Yeah, that's fair. - Anyway, the "grammable" stuff, is easy. - You're the one they sent to culinary school, not me. - I could teach you. - Well, you want to stay here then? - Well, no. - Then just keep things the same so that we can continue to do what we do, without you. Can you do that? Good. I have to run an errand, you're in charge. It's gonna be lit? Woo ~ (chair dragging) (papers rustling) (soft music) (water running) (pen clatters) - Hi, sorry Christine.

(plates clanking) (door opens) (Philippine guitar plays) - Christine, it's been a while. Good to see you. - Good to see you too, sir. - Is your mom around? - No, she's at home resting, but I can speak for her. - Oh, is she sick? I'm sorry. Is she okay? - Well, she's fine. It's my dad. He passed away four days ago. - Oh my God, Christine. I'm so sorry, I had no idea. Was it an accident? - No, during his sleep. - You know, we should sit. - Oh yeah. (chair dragging) - I'm sorry, Christine, I hate to do this, especially with the circumstances here. But. (papers rustling) I came here to evict you. I suspected something was wrong when they didn't pay rent for three months, Ignoring my calls, emails. Now it makes sense. - This is crazy. Can't we work something out? - I'm afraid it's too late for that. You guys are the only Filipino restaurant in the area. I wanna keep you, but I've done as much as I can to help them stay afloat. - Wait, wait, stay afloat? - Yeah, they haven't been doing so well the last few months. - What if we paid, a month and a half of rent for the rest of the year, slowly pay back the debt and see where we are in January? - Christine, I don't know how that can be achievable. This place is empty. - The holidays are just around the corner. If we can't pay back the owed debt, you can terminate our lease. That's it. Please? - Look, I've already put out feelers to move someone in. Now, if there's someone willing to buy you out before then... - Thank you. Thank you so much, Dennis.

We thought it'd be a good idea to play catch with the little cock-a-doodles, so-- - Don't call them that. You and Tito, I swear. - What? The cock-a-doodles. Don't interrupt me. So you know, we chase them, we catch them, and then we try to make them fight. But then here comes the mama chicken and she would- "Tuk tuk tuk!" Oh my God. - How old were you? - Maybe sixteen. - I had no idea. - Oh, there was this one time with your dad though. My dad, he didn't allow us to see each other on the weekends. So we planned to sneak over to my cousin's house. Well, I got there early and started drinking. Oh, I was so happy! I was sneaking around, I was seeing your dad. It was exciting, you know. So I didn't realize how much I drank. And I started to throw up. Well, my cousins- They were too drunk to take care of me. So your dad did, and we got caught by my Tito. - Ow! I told myself I'll never drink like that again. (laughs) - You were wild. - Holy crap Mom. - Oh yeah, that was a long time ago. Bad headaches the next day, you know? (both laugh) You know, anak, you remind me of your dad. Oh I miss him, it's so quiet at night. I thought I'd get better sleep without his snoring. He's like, (Mary snores) (Mary laughs) You know, and you and your Tatay fought. - [Christine] Mom-- - Shht! I'm glad you left to do what you did. - Then why have you been so mad? - Because I'm your mother, you tell me everything. You left without even saying goodbye. Why, if you told me, maybe it wouldn't have been so sad. Maybe we could have talked. - It felt like the right thing to do at the time. - And now? Are you going to stay? - Just for now, okay? I'll do what I can but-- I just don't love it anymore. - Well, you used to love it. (Christine laughs) - "Lab" it? - "Love" it. Do I sound American? - You have the Asian Glow, Mom. - Yaaaas! - [Christine] Are you drunk? - Oh my gosh, my face is hot. - Because you're drunk! - No, I'm not drunk! I'm tipsy. - [Reggie] Give it up deep for Abby, everyone. (crowd applauding) Next up I would like to bring up a very special lady. - This is it. - [Reggie] She is the mother of a very good friend of mine who needs our love and support right now. So can I get a big round of applause for Mrs. Mary Santos! (crowd cheering) - It's you, it's you. - What? - Come on up here, Auntie Mary. Come on up! - I cannot believe you two. (crowd applauding) - That's my mom! - [Megan] Show them how it's done Auntie. - Reggie! - Get it, girl.

(Christine laughs) - Don't laugh at me. - Well, it's funny. - Are you hungover? - Nope. I acquired a huge tolerance in college. Threw huge ragers, got trashed. - Mmhmm. - Are you going through Dad's stuff? - Yes, but it's hard. I found some of your stuff you gave to your dad when you were younger. It's in that pile over there, if you want to take a look. (soft music) (paper rustling) You should stay at the restaurant. - No, I have a show. - But Tito said you seem happy. - Yeah, for now, but... - What do you mean? - Working at the restaurant, it used to be something I loved, but it became punishment. - We did not force you to do that. - Yes, you did. - No. - Yes, you did. In college, when you found out I was getting a degree in acting and business, you pulled me out of the program to do culinary classes. - We were not going to pay for your schooling to twirl and twirl on stage. - It is not twirling! - Anak, you were failing at school. If you just focus on business, like we said, this would not have had happened. - Mom, we're getting evicted. Dad has been keeping this from you this entire time. I had to beg Dennis to keep us open. We can get kicked out at any moment. So unless dad left a bunch of money, our business is done! What? - I know. - What? - I already knew. - Did dad leave a separate pension or something? - No, but we couldn't let you go unsupported to L.A. So supporting you and a slow business, it all adds up. - Tito was supporting me. - Well, Tito, yes at first. But then we asked him how you're surviving, so your dad started sending you money instead. - This whole time? - What? You think we're just going to let you suffer on your own? We're not bad parents. (somber music) What's the problem? You got what you wanted. - This whole time. It's been him? Now it's my fault. It's my fault that the restaurant is failing because I was selfish to leave. - No, anak. No, it's not like that. - I gotta go. I gotta go to work. - Anak, wait! (somber music) (phone chimes) - Ay nako. Christine! (car door opens) (car door shuts) Christine! (car starting) Christine. (car engine revving) (retches) (Mary hurls) (somber piano) (car engine accelerating) (tires screech) (heavy breathing) - Shit. Please pick up. (phone rings) - [Megan] Hey, it's Megan. Leave me a message. - God damn it. (phone dialing) (phone rings) - [John] Hey, you've reached John. Leave a message. - I'm mad at you, John. I'm mad at you and how you didn't wanna be a part of my family, and how you left me, and how you made me angry with my dad because you didn't wanna be a part of my family. I'm mad at you. (Christine sobs) - [Automated Message] If you're satisfied with the message, press one. To listen to your message, press two. To erase and rerecord, press three. (phone beeps) - [Automated Message] Message erased. (Christine crying) - Ay nako. (phone dialing) (phone rings) - [Tony] Hoy! Ate. What's up? - Ay, Tony. (slurps drool) - Ate? Hello? - [Mary] Tony, it hurts. It hurts! Oh God! - I know, Ate. I know it hurts. - Our Father who art in heaven Hallowed be thy name - The kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. - Why is it like this? Oh my God. - I don't know, Ate. I don't know why it hurts so much. - Ayy... I - I cannot do... I cannot do it! (whines) - You can, Ate. You can. You can do this. We're all here for you, to support you. We love you, and want to see that strong Ate Mary that we all know. I can't come back home now though. Amy's engagement party is soon. (Mary hurls) - Ay shit. (gags) Ate? - Ay, Christine! Tell Christine to come back home. (somber music) (high pitch ringing) (footsteps approaching) - Are you trying to see how much pressure it takes to break a glass? - Oh, no. Hi. - So sorry I missed your call. I've been going around like crazy running all these errands today. Ube cookies! You made them? - Yeah, but they're not like the ones you had last night though. - Are you okay? - My mom and I had a huge fight this morning. - Really? You two were like peas in a pod last night. - So we're getting evicted and there are these two people who've already come to see this place. Oh, and it's all my fault. I don't know what to do-- - Hey, hey, hey, I told you Chrissie, it's not your fault. We just want to make sure you're okay. - Well, it feels like it is. - It's all good. It's going to be fine, just take a break. - I can't. Auntie Bess is coming and it's going to be all out for this Filipino Nurses Association party. Has it always been this extravagant? - It's gotten there. - What? - Nothing. Uncle Tony, can you make us drinks? - Yaaaas. They're amazing. Like the classic screw driver, except I add my own little twist to it. Trying to be OG, you know, original gangstah. (Christine groans) - Why didn't you tell her? - You are her best friend. - How can she not know that this is Amy and John's engagement party? - She wasn't supposed to be here. I also completely forgot. - That's probably why Mary told me to send her home. (smacks hand) Although I couldn't really understand her. It sounded like she was throwing up. - Very possible. She got hammered last night. - Wow, the old Mary coming out of her shell. (snaps) - Uncle Tony, focus. You cannot let her out of that kitchen. If she sees John she'll die. - I know John dumped her. But she shouldn't she be over that by now? - Christine, John and Amy. He dumped her and he immediately went out with Amy. There might have been some cross over there. I don't know why everyone's obsessed with him. He's not even that cute. - I hear that. (Tony chuckles) (whimsical music) - Flower centerpieces? Do we have flowers for my dad's funeral tomorrow? - My mom's taking care of it. Don't worry about it. Anyway, it's almost about an hour before guests arrive, which means the White Folk will come early, which means you only have about half an hour to get shit done. - Yeah, you're right. Do me a favor? Keep Auntie Bess out of the kitchen as much as possible? - Don't worry, I will. (phone rings) - Look, see? I can't catch a break. - [Christine] Hi Marisa! I'm doing okay... - Get ready to be screwed! See what I did there? - This is why you can't get a date. (whimsical music) (noodles sizzling) (kitchen noise) - Um, Christine? The lady wants to see you. - Which lady? - The lady whose party it is. - Well, can you tell her I'm busy cooking her food? - She said it's urgent. Anyway, she doesn't understand why some of the food in the warmer looks weird. - Looks weird? I'm making what she ordered. (scoffs) - Goddamn it. (crowd chattering) (whoosh) (dramatic tone) (Christine hyperventilating) (footsteps thudding) (door slams) They're engaged? - I didn't know that you didn't know. - How was I supposed to know? - It's all over their Facebook and Instagram. - Well, I blocked them. - Damn you're strong. When Rick dumped me, I Facebook stalked the shit out of him for months nonstop. - Well duh, I did that too, but it'd be a little crazy, if I did that half a year later. - I really thought you were being grown up, like okay, L.A. really made Chrissie grow some thick skin. - I mean like why would they even have it here? I mean, you have it at like a fancy place with salmon and mixed veggies. Not pork's blood with stir fried noodle. - Some crazy shit happened over at the last venue, and your mom gave them a mad discount. Look, it's not my engagement. Okay? - Oh okay. And what, like, you're like a bridesmaid? (scoffs) (metal clanking) Oh my God. You're a bridesmaid? - We all grew up together, Chrissie. She's still my friend. - You are a bridesmaid. God, I am such... What am I doing here? I'm such a loser-- - Hey, hey, hey. You're not a loser. Just pull yourself together a bit, okay? And John, he's just some dude. I know this is crazy, but I'm here for you, okay? I promise. Right, just do-- - Christine. Well, honey, what are you doing here? Where's your mom? Is she still feeling sick? Poor thing she missed the prayer service last night. How are you? We did not think it would be a problem since you moved to L.A. My God, in fact, I was supposed to have the party somewhere else, but it closed due to rat infestation. Oh my God, trust me, we would not have done this to you. It was last minute, honey. - Ay, Bess. - I promise you it was last minute. - Let's let her work. It's too crowded in here. - But Tony, why is my adobo in a tortilla, ha? And the kaldereta is like big pieces of meat, like a meatball. It doesn't make sense. Are those meatballs meant for me? - It's just a fancier way to presenting the-- - Oh my gosh... Christine, Christine, how much longer until our food is ready? Because it's 4:30 na, our non-Filipino guests are already here. You know, they don't go by our Filipino time. - Yeah, Auntie Bess, actually we got it under control. - Are you okay, honey? Are you eating? Oh my God, I know the timing is just awful. I know. But we will make it fast, okay? So you can go home early, okay? Christine? Oh my God. - [Tony] Bess-- Okay. Wait, wait, teka, teka, wait - Here. Okay, you take this, you take a little break and you eat something, okay? Oh my God. - Ok, Christine, here's our plan. - [Bess] Where is Mary? - Just stay here. You don't need to go out. Alright? Is that one of our--? - [Bess] She said she would stop by. - How many more dishes do we need? - [Bess] Oh my God. Thank you, God. Can you please take this up? - [Megan] Oh no, actually Jerry could help. Jerry--? - Please. They are starving outside. Let's go. Help me girls! - Okay fine. (footsteps thudding) - [Christine] Just put this down. (crowd chattering) - Christine! - Get away from me, get away from me. (thud, crowd gasps) - What the hell, Christine? - Oh my... I didn't mean to do that. - How do you not mean to do that? - I didn't want him to hug me. - So you ball tap him? - I'm good. I just didn't want you to hug me. - I just thought, you called. - It's time, tell her na-- - That was a mistake. - Christine, please. - No, John, I can't. I can't do this. - We messed up Christine. I'm sorry, it ended up this way and, we are sorry that your dad passed. I hate that we're not friends, Christine. What John and I did to you. - The way we handled it... We should have told you. - We've been wanting to reach out to you, but I am so happy that you're here. (Christine laughs maniacally) - Okay, we can stop-- - No! No. You don't get to have this. I'm mad at you. The both of you! - Christine... calm down. - Oh, I'm calm! I'm calm. To Amy and John! May your marriage last as long as the blood of a cow, trapped in a cage until matured, slaughtered and collected in a bucket. May it be as flavorful and as spicy until the bitter toilet plunging end--! (metal clanking) I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. (footsteps thudding) - Okay, okay Christine. - Just go back, we'll clean this. (Christine sobbing) No it's okay, it's all right. [Megan] Jerry, we need a mop. (Christine sobs) [Tony] It's okay Christine. - [Mary] Oh my gosh, Anak, anak, what happened? Okay, come on, sige, let's go, come on. It's okay, leave it, leave it. (Christine sobs) - It's all my fault he's gone. I didn't mean it-- - I just wish I said goodbye to him, Mom. I wish I didn't fight with him. Maybe if I didn't maybe none of this would have happened. I am so sorry. I am so sorry. - Anak, look at me. It's okay. It's okay. Really, it's okay. Let's go home. - How did you get here? - I took a Lyft. Come on. (heartfelt music) - These are so good. You should sell these. - I've been trying a lot of new things... It's helping me cope. - I don't know how you could be so strong. - Oh, I don't know about that. Your Tito saw the worst. It's hard. I don't know why God took him away so early. I don't know. But I do know I have to be strong for you. And I know there's a reason. - Mom? - Hmm? - Why did you have their engagement party at our restaurant? - I didn't think you'd be back. - Of course I was gonna come back. - Well, I didn't know what to think. - I'm sorry. I'm sorry I left you alone with him. That night, when we all fought, cause John didn't greet dad when he entered the restaurant - - I remember. (metal clanking) (pan sizzling) - Hey babe. - Hi babe! (soft music) - [Christine] Thank you so much. (kisses) - Hey you. What are you doing here? You're not supposed to be here. - Mr. Santos, I'm only here to help-- - You're not even gonna say hello? What? - No dad, what's wrong? - You're disrespecting her? [Manny] What the hell are you doing in here? - What the-- Dad! (hand burning) Dad! - [Manny] Let go! - [Christine] You can't do that! - Let go, let go! - [Mary] That's enough! - What the hell, Dad? - God damn it! - [Mary] No! (hand striking) (gasping) - I am not a kid anymore dad, you can't do that! You can't do that to me! - [Mary] Stop, stop, please! John! John. (somber music) - That was a difficult day. - John always made me feel like someone that I wanted to be and could be. But he left me because of how dad reacted. Dad just blew up, for nothing. - Your dad, he was just trying to protect you. - From what, Mom? Kisses? - John should have known to greet your dad. - And pushing John? Almost hitting me? That's more respectful? - It happens. You know, when I was young-- - When I was young, I understood. Discipline? Fine. But now, but here? It doesn't have to come to that. It shouldn't have to come to that. I just, I couldn't be around Dad anymore. Dad just, he just controls everything. - That's just, that's how it is. - It shouldn't be, Nanay. - That's the way we were raised. That's it, okay? Anak, I don't know about John, but I know your dad loved you very much. He's just, he's a man, you know? No talking, only action... But I know he'd be happy you came home and help keep the business alive. I know I am. - Now I can't go back. - No, you can go back. - And what? Let the restaurant fail? Leave you with nothing? - There's some money, there's a lot to go through. We can sell some stuff. I'll figure it out with your Tito. Come, we missed his prayer last night. We should pray to him before we sleep. Lord through the blood of your cross, have mercy on the soul of Manny Santos. (soft music) - [Tony] Manny Santos was born and raised in the Philippines. At a young age, he joined the US Navy. At 21, he went back to the Philippines to wed Mary, and at twenty-two had his beautiful Christine Anna -Maria. ♪ In all of these years ♪ ♪ I never really knew you ♪ ♪ And now that we're here ♪ ♪ I can see you now ♪ ♪ You made me my best ♪ ♪ You made me my worst ♪ ♪ I'll let our worst rest ♪ ♪ Can you see me now? ♪ ♪ Can you see me now? ♪ ♪ What I'd give ♪ ♪ To be in ♪ ♪ Your arms ♪ ♪ What I'd give ♪ ♪ To be in ♪ ♪ Your arms ♪ ♪ Aahh ♪ ♪ Aahh ♪ ♪ Aahh ♪ ♪ Aahh ♪ ♪ Oh Lord ♪ ♪ We stand here before you ♪ ♪ What you have in store ♪ ♪ We can take it ♪ ♪ We'll make it ♪ ♪ Welcome him ♪ ♪ Let him in your arms ♪ ♪ Welcome him ♪ ♪ Let him in ♪ ♪ Your arms ♪ ♪ Aahh ♪ ♪ Your Arms ♪ ♪ Aahh ♪ ♪ Let him in your arms ♪ (gentle piano) ♪ Welcome him ♪ ♪ In your arms ♪ (birds chirping) (gentle music) (laughing) - Thank you so much. - Thank you. - I'll see you next week (upbeat music) - Oh, that looks so good. - Thank you. - I like it with the orange-- - Ready, na? - Oh yes, please carry it out.

There's a Filipino couple that would like to be our business partners. They'll take care of the restaurant while we'll be their in-house bakers. - They love your pastries. - Really? And I think it's a wonderful business opportunity for you. For all of you. - [Mary] Wow. - This is gonna be great. We can bake together, like we used to. It'll be called, "Nanay Ko". - Oh!
