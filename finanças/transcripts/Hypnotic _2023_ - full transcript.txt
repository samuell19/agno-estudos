Rourke? Rourke. Come back to us. Sorry. Drifted off for a second. The park? What about it? That's where you drift to, isn't it? That park. That day. Take me back there. What do you see? Dad. Fix my braid. Her hair. I see her hair. Your daughter? Minnie. This is not a braid. This is a maze... that only your mother can solve. There you go. Thank you, Dad! She was playing this game, where she would see how many times she could spin around in one place before she fell over. When did you see him? I barely noticed him. I was just happy to be with my daughter. I wasn't paying attention for just... just for a second... and I turned around... and I didn't see her... and I got up... and I called out for her... and I looked for her, and I c... I c... She was gone. Rourke? I was there. There was nothing you could do. Work? Uh... That depends on you, I guess. Uh, if you think I'm ready for duty. Do you feel ready, emotionally? I think it's the only thing keeping me sane. Though the missing child has not been recovered, a suspect is in custody for the abduction of a police detective's daughter. Alleged kidnapper, 18-year old Lyle Terry, has pled not guilty due to mental incapacity, his lawyers insisting he has no memory whatsoever of the incident, nor of Minnie's current whereabouts or final resting place. What, you lose something, compadre? Cockroach. Yeah. It's a hot day. Damn things are everywhere. Hey, did you wipe your shoes? So how did it go in there? You good? Yeah. No problem. I'm all clear for duty. What's the call? Oh, it's a fun one. Anonymous tip came into dispatch. Blocked number. I'm calling to report a robbery. Are you in a safe location? Nobody's safe. Nice line. Just wait. Is this crime currently in progress? Today, the Bank of Austin. There's a safe-deposit box. Box 23. Box 2-3. Is that the target? Hello? Flair for drama. You're thinking it's a prank. I get it. That's what I thought, too. Except? Two armed robberies this week at Bank of Austin at branches Houston and Amarillo. Both inside jobs involving people with access. Both hit the safe-deposit boxes, but take only one box and no money at all. No shit? Captain put us on stakeout. Getting audio. A guy goes up to the bartender, and he says, "Hey, bartender. I got me a bet for you. "I'm going to bet you 300 bucks that I can piss into that glass over there, and not spill..." All right, come on. Move on. - Wait. This is a good one. - The bartender looks... - I don't know, it. - Hey! I said, move on. Piss into, something like... He pisses on the bartender. - No kidding. - It's a whole thing. Yeah, it's a good one. See that guy on the bench? He looks familiar. No. No. The city contracts. You know this guy? - Thanks. - Not sure. Do you have a lighter? Quite masculine. Is it yours? My husband gave it to me. I don't smoke. He's got you under his spell, doesn't he? Yes, he does. It's very hot today. I didn't notice. Trust me, it's like a furnace. Great. We got the weather. Can we move on now? That guy's up to something. Zoom in. It's a sunny day. You see that? He's speaking in code. The guards are in on it. Hey! Rourke! Wait! So hot. He's going for the bank. Don't walk into that bank, Rourke. We don't know if that's the guy. It's like a furnace. Watch the woman. I'll send back-up. Do not follow. Yeah, roger that. Danny, get out of that bank. Can I help you, sir? I repeat, do not break... You know I'd like to open a safe-deposit box. Right this way. It's so hot. It's like a furnace. If you just fill this out, we'll get you set right up. Shoot. Excuse me. I must have left my keys in my office. I'll be right back. Thank you. Here you go. Have a great day. Good morning, sir. Morning? It's late afternoon. It is late afternoon. Minnie. Stop. Police. Stop. I said, stop where you are. Stop! Oh, shit! - Rourke! - Send back-up! Go. Go! Do you mind? Stop! Hands up, asshole! Don't move! Cuff him. What are you waiting for? Cuff him. But I'm the wrong man. He's the wrong man. What? You crooked bastards. Who do you work for? Don't blame them, Detective. They're no more conscious of themselves than Lyle Terry was. That was his name, wasn't it? The pawn who took your queen. Where is she? Give that to me. Where is she? What does it mean? Who's Lev Dellrayne? What the hell? Clean this up, detectives. No! Nobody saw him flee the scene? We put out an APB. Still nothing. The guards? Crew? Teller woman? Anything? The ones that survive claim they can't remember anything. Just like Lyle Terry. Danny. He said his name, Nicks. He had this picture of my daughter in a safe-deposit box. You want to explain that to me? All right. That story was all over the news. A cop's kid gets abducted. For all we know, this is some sick joke. Someone messing with you, messing with us. Hell, our own guys were in on this one. I saw the way he looked at me. He knows. He knows where my daughter is. I'm sure of it. All right. How do we catch the bastard? Hey. What's up? Promise me I'm not an idiot for trusting you. What do you got? That call that came in, that tipped us to the bank? Blocked number, no I.D.? Ran a trace. We got an address. Oh. A storefront out on Chapel. I shouldn't be doing this, Rourke. I haven't even told the Cap yet. Text it to me. I'll be right there. The call came from the phone of Diana Cruz, a dime-store psychic with a few arrests for mail fraud. No convictions. You're in front of the house. You go up the steps. You step through the door... and you see her there. She's holding something in her arms. It's a baby. She's holding you. I love you, Mama. I'm sorry. Is it over? What happened? We have company. Good evening, ma'am. Austin Police Department. I'd like to speak with you. How can I help you, Officer? Detective, actually, and, uh... Hello. This piggy bothering you, Di? It's cool, Tiny. I can handle him. I'll be outside. I'll just take a few minutes of your time. Sure. He'll be out there on his bike until you leave. Oh. Loyal customer. I inspire that in people. Detective Rourke, isn't it? Well, that's some impressive mind-reading. I just read the news. You're the one who lost his kid. Must have been awful. If you're open to a session, hypnosis can be therapeutic. Confronting the past. I'm interested in your past. Diana Cruz, accused of bilking clients in Laredo, San Antonio. Packed up shop and moved down here. Those charges were lies. I'm not bunko. Okay? I'm not here to bust you. I just want to know how a two-bit con artist like you got involved with Lev Dellrayne. I know you called the tip in on the bank heist. Did you catch someone? Not yet. They got away. Then you need to leave. Why don't you come to the station with me? - Am I under arrest? - No. Then get out. - I can see you're afraid... - Get the hell out of here. You know what? Why don't you tell me what you're afraid of? You stay. I'm out. I can protect you. You don't know anything. I know I saw him at the bank. Didn't I? Lev Dellrayne. - Are you all right? - Yes. Thank you. He was sent to kill us. Who are you? Hey! He won't tell you anything. I can be pretty persuasive myself. He... won't... stop. I didn't think you were arresting me. I'm not. We use this for storage nowadays. You'll be safe here. Nicks, run the vic's I.D... Look for past gang affiliations, former cellmates. There's got to be some connection to Dellrayne. All we've got to do is find it. Let's keep her out of it for now. The Captain will be asking questions. Tell her I'm working on it. We're going to run priors on your biker friend. Whatever connection he has or link to Dellrayne, I'm sure it will come up. You won't find anything. You might be surprised. You think learning who he is will tell you why he did it? What other motive is there? What makes four total strangers pull off an elaborate bank heist on a whim? I'm guessing you're going to say Lev Dellrayne. Why don't you tell me who he is? What does he have on these people? Are you familiar with the concept of hypnotic constructs? Look, lady, come on. First, it's, uh, fortune telling. Now it's hypnosis. - I... - It's not hypnosis. Hypnotics have abilities far beyond anything we have a name for. "Hypnotics"? People with the ability to actually influence the brain over a psychic bandwidth. Like telepathy? Telepaths just read the mind. Hypnotics reshape its reality. The guy at the bank, you said he spoke four words to a woman and she undressed. Because she was in on it. No. Those were cues... Sound, voice, locking eyes. Hypnotics use them to make you see a version of the world that doesn't exist. Your behavior conforms with this hypnotic construct, so everything that you see and do feels perfectly normal. How is it that you know so much about these hypnotics? Because I am one. Bullshit. A cynic. Mind control? Dream bank accounts? Sounds more like my ex-wife. Take it easy, Nicks. We just watched two cops blow each other's brains out, and she's saying it's some Vegas act. She's playing us. Why don't you have a seat, Nicks? You're a prisoner. Act like one. Nicks? Oh, God. Hey. Nicks! Let's cut the shit out. Stop that, whatever you're doing. Why don't you get some air? Hey, you know what? I could use some air. I'll be outside. Don't worry, Detective. I already tried it on you. It didn't work. Who the hell are you? Just get me some coffee. Maybe I'll tell you. Need a light? They were looking for people who thought they had above-normal intuitive ability. I usually make some money reading tarot. They were offering 50 bucks. I thought, "What the hell?" and took the test. A week later, there were two suits waiting in my dorm room. Feds? They said I could finish my degree, rack up more student debt, or I could come with them and earn six figures in six months. That's not a government salary. The Division started as a privately-run U.S. government program, developing methods to influence political outcomes. Defense contractor. Defense, offense, whatever needed doing. The Division advanced American interests around the world, but then they discovered the hypnotic ability within humans... and that this ability could be trained. Improved upon. Hypnotics had a way to get it done without receipts. What about Dellrayne? He was the legend. The most powerful hypnotic ever trained. All of us were amateurs compared to him. But then he went rogue. Dellrayne believed that only he could realize the hypnotic's true potential, and tried to take over the Division. I was one of the agents who stood in his way. Division locked him up. I knew it wouldn't last. So I made it out. Cut ties. Started fresh. Last week, when I read about the robberies, the other banks, and that no one even remembered him, I knew that it was Dellrayne... and I also knew that no one who knows that he exists is safe. Especially you. He can't be caught. Stay here. Nicks? Nicks, it's me. Nicks? Put the gun down, Nicks. It's not him anymore. Do something. Wake him up. Dellrayne is doing this. I'm not strong enough. Nicks, put it down. Nicks, stop where you are! Nicks, stop or I'll shoot! Do it! Rourke! Okay, buddy. Are you all right? It's me. You okay? You all right? You're all right. I got you in the leg. You're okay. He won't stop until he accomplishes what he's been told to do. Rourke, we need to go. Nicks. Stop, Nicks. Stop. Nicks. Hey! Wake up! He's too far gone. Nicks. He'll kill us both. Nicks, this isn't you. Nicks! - He'll pull his hand off! - Nicks! Rourke! Nicks! Put the gun down. Put it down! You killed him. He was already dead. He was already dead. I set him free. Nicks? Nicks... A veteran police detective, Daniel Rourke, is wanted with another suspect seen here, in connection with the execution-style slaying of his former partner, Randy Nicks. Police detective Daniel Rourke's missing daughter... He had a wife. Two kids. We had no choice. They think I killed him. That's exactly what Dellrayne wants. You don't know who you're dealing with. I know he took my daughter. What do you mean? This was, uh... in the safe-deposit box at the bank. It's what Dellrayne came for. You don't understand what it's like. They never found her body. The guy they arrested... swears he doesn't even remember the kidnapping. I always thought he was lying. What if he was telling the truth? What if my daughter's still out there? Morning, Luz. Morning. Just give me a couple of them breakfast tacos, extra chorizo. Coffee? Black and sludgy. Call it in. You just saw us heading north. Dispatch. This is Tex DPS calling to report two fugitives. Male and female heading north on I35 from Stonewall Trail. He'll get the check. Be generous. Luz? It's about time that I finally gave you a decent tip. This is dispatch. Two officers are arriving at your location now. I found you, Diana. Find us a way out of here. I have what he wants. - No. - I'll distract him. Rourke! No! He'll kill you! Rourke! Shit! Ready to go? Get out. - That's a way out. - Yeah. A construct makes you see what the hypnotic wants you to see. It can look like anything. It's whatever makes you do the behavior they want. But you're different. Why? You have a block, Detective. A psychic block. A hypnotic's worst nightmare. Everyone's subconscious mind puts up a barrier to entry. For most people, it's a padlock, or a simple one, two, three code. Yours... is locked inside a vault, buried in a bunker 10 feet deep. I guess I'm lucky I'm such a head case. Your block could come from anywhere. Scar tissue. Emotional trauma. Your daughter maybe. Pain can keep the mind awake. But the bottom line is, I can't get to you... but Dellrayne can. Excuse me, Officer. Which way is Mexico? Bet you've never gotten a speeding ticket either. Nope. Jeremiah was my handler in the Division, Southwest Station Chief. Strong hypnotic? He's not one, actually. Just a mean old bastard with a psychic block that makes yours... look like a childproof safety cap. So you can't influence him? Not for long before he spots the gap. Only Dellrayne ever could. This guy can help us catch him. Is your gun loaded? I thought this guy liked you. He loved me like a daughter, but I didn't split with the Division on the best of terms. I left him hogtied in a bathtub. Got it. Maria, la puerta! ¿Quién es? Stop, stop, stop. Get back. It's open. Hands up, jackass. ¿Ahora quién es el pendejo? You sneaky bitch. You taught me well. Yes, I did. Well, looks like you've got a student of your own now. Where... Where is Maria? On a beach somewhere, making a sandcastle. Hmm. Lucky her. There's tamales in the fridge. Help yourself. You know why we're here. It's not just a friendly visit, then? I'm assuming that you know that Dellrayne is out. I may have heard. What does he want? What's he after? Are you serious? Does it look like I'm kidding? - Domino. - What's Domino? - A myth. - Yeah. See, that's the thing. You kind of left too soon. - You said it was destroyed. - Want to fill me in here? Project Domino, Division's Holy Grail. It was a tool made in our lab... One that could control even the most powerful hypnotics. - Even Dellrayne? - Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Especially Dellrayne. That's why he stole it from us. Then he reset his own mind to hide the trail. When we finally caught him, he had no memory of who he was, what he'd done with Domino, nothing. He erased his own mind? About six weeks ago, it started to flood back. He broke out of our facility. He kind of, you know, did the... fooled the guards. He must have planted triggers. It's clues the hypnotics leave behind, like signposts for their own subconscious. It can be words, images, details. Puzzle pieces that they use and scatter, in case their minds get reset. You know, put the jigsaw back together. Remember who they are. The safe-deposit boxes. He's following the breadcrumbs. Yes. He must have planted a whole stream before we caught him. The first few? That just restored a portion of his power. Each one, he's going to get stronger. He gets the last one, there's no stopping him. Where did you get that? The bank in Austin. It was in the safe-deposit box he was after. It's a picture of my daughter. Well, she may play a role in all this. It could be another trigger. Here. Let me see. What did you do to him? Who? This guy? Why are you backing up? Run. Get back! We're trapped! What you see isn't real. If you got any powers you're holding out on, now's the time. All out. Rourke? Rourke? I'm not doing this. No. I am. It just doesn't make sense. I mean, what? Do I have powers all of a sudden? I mean, how did I do that? I don't know. You saw it. You were right there. You know, one second, he was coming right at me. The next minute, it was literally as if I was inside their minds. Welcome to the club. That's not possible. I've never done anything like this before. I wouldn't know how. Or you just can't remember. - I... - What you just did? Power like this, it takes more than natural ability, okay? And I have no idea how you did it. All right. I have to know everything. Why me? Why my daughter? Dellrayne, Domino, this. Will you help me, please? Yes. River is the guy who built their network. If there's anyone who can hack into their database, it's him. He helped me disappear when I left Division. But fair warning... he can be eccentric. Oh! And you're the normal one. He's a friend. Uh-huh, yeah. Good illusions anyways. No illusion. We're real. We need your help. With Dellrayne. I-I can't help you. If he knows we're here, he'll torture and reset you anyway. You're cold, Cruz. At least offer us a drink. I was going to. Anyways. I think. What happened to your eye? Asymmetrical shapes help fool facial recognition. Camera drones and satellites everywhere these days. Not to mention the Division. Are you inside my mind right now? No. We're both friends. Amigos. Okay. Listen, uh, don't... don't judge. I wasn't expecting visitors. This way. Watch your step. You know, you could have called, Diana. Sent a text, you know, one of those little Morse code thingies. I do have radio, you know. Showing up unannounced is just rude. Ah. Homemade Mountain Dew. My own brew. All organic. Uh, no thanks. All right. Huh? All right, fine. More for me. Mm. Check it out. Pretty impressive, huh? Hypnotics did all this? Uh-huh. It's a worldwide play, brother. Controlling major news, events, organizations. Why the hell are you here, Diana? Dellrayne is back. It has something to do with Rourke's missing daughter. Dellrayne sent an army for us. Rourke, he took control. He overpowered him. Huh. More than meets the eye, huh? Apparently. But to what degree? Let's find out. All right, now listen, I've got to tell you, hacking into a database this big ain't easy-breezy, all right? All right, Austin PD database has you employed 12 years. That's right. All right. I got a hit for the Marine Corps. Distinguished Service medal, honorable discharge. Said you had a family. Uh, let's see. Archives show no record of a Daniel Rourke's spouse. Can't be. What was your wife's maiden name? Riley. Vivian Riley. Vivian Riley. That's her. Whoa. "Vivian Riley... Division agent." That's impossible. "Current location encrypted." Can you hack it? I'll run something. It'll take a few hours. That's not right. We were together since college. I came home, had Minnie, a family. This is my life. I'm sorry. You look like you need a drink. Moonshine. Thanks. Burns a little, but at least it will help you forget. When we lost Minnie... we lost everything. We lost ourselves. The body of police Detective Daniel Rourke's missing daughter, Minnie Rourke, has still not been recovered. And I can't keep going! Nothing we had survived. I can't. Maybe Viv lied about who she was. But the pain was real. Sometimes, it's all I had to hold on to. Whatever you're selling, I'm not interested. You're never going to find your daughter. How about I kill you? You think you're strong? More powerful than me? I have other ways of getting to you. Diana betrayed me, and now you're going to kill her. Put that gun in your hand. Put three bullets in her head. No. Diana. - Just a minute. - Diana. Di... I'm coming. I had to borrow one of River's shirts. What happened? He got to you, didn't he? I can see it. I heard a phone ring. Did you answer it? Yes. Did he speak? What did he tell you? I... I don't... What is it that you see? I don't know. Where's your phone? I know things feel off. I know she hurt you. Do we have trust? Project Domino was never a what. No. It was a who. Where is she? Is she even alive? Where did you take her? I didn't take her. You did. She's going to have opportunities. On the one hand, you think, well, I really am the person that should make these decisions, but on the other hand, you're better off away from her. I'm her mother. Yeah, well, I'm her father. They wanted to take her. The Division only wanted to train her like they trained us... To be what she was born to be... The most powerful hypnotic in the world. She was just a child. Minnie? You kidnapped our daughter. I protected her from you. I protected her from all of you. Where are we now? Are we really even here? Can't you see it yet? Look closer. You're in on this, too, Nicks? Or whatever your name is? You brought this on yourself. By the time we found you, Domino was gone... and you reset yourself. Wiped clean. No memory of where you hid her... for four years. You've been an obstacle to me for too long, Rourke. This was dropped off at Division headquarters... six weeks ago. A clue or a taunt. You know what it means. Buried underneath that psychic block. That's why we developed this construct. The cop searching for the man who took his missing daughter. Using my own brain against me. To get you to remember where you hid her. Like it or not, your daughter is going to reach her full potential with me. Who is Lev Dellrayne? This is where it always ends. We can't brute-force a mind like yours, Dan. This was our 12th run of the scenario. But every time we get too close, you see the gaps, and the construct breaks. Just help us find her. You had 12 runs at this... and you haven't found her? Well, get ready for number 13. Because I'll never tell you where she is. Take him in. Your mind can't take much more... of this... resets. At some point, the synapses start breaking down, and it's too late to get back what you were, what we had. Was any of it real? I love you. Don't ask me why. You remember, don't you? The good times. We did have a few. I remember everything. I know we wanted different things for her. I know you want her to be free to make her own decisions. She's too powerful to be out there alone. She needs her mom and dad. We can be with her again. Together, Danny. Just tell me where she is. Go to hell. Initiate the reset. Where's your wife? I don't know. Where is your daughter? I don't know. Have you ever been in love? I don't know. Subject is clear. Prepare sequence. Okay. One kidnapping coming right up. All right, people, let's go to reset. Places, everybody. Okay, here we go. Rourke? Rourke. Rourke? Come back to us. Sorry. Must have drifted off for a second. It's okay. It's your time. Where was I? The park? Your daughter. Right. The park. Her hair. I remember her hair. Heart rate is normal. He's deep in the construct now. Alleged kidnapper 18-year old Lyle Terry has pled not guilty due to mental incapacity, his lawyers insisting he has no memory whatsoever... He's noting where his wedding band used to be. That's my cue. You lose something, compadre? Cockroach. Yeah, it's a hot day. The damn things are everywhere. Hey. Did you wipe your shoes? Call came into dispatch. Blocked number. I'm calling to report a robbery. Is this crime currently in progress? Today, the Bank of Austin. There's a safe-deposit box. Box 23. We're here. Welcome to the show, boys. See that guy on the bench? He looks familiar. Something wrong, bud? It's a sunny day. The guards are in on it. Rourke. Rourke, wait! Get ready for the bank robbery. Where's Rourke? Where's Rourke? River? Where is he? Whoa, whoa, whoa. I don't have eyes. Stand by. Anybody got eyes on Rourke? All hands on deck. Subject has broken through. Stop. Turn off the engine. And step out. Rourke... turn off the engine. And step out. Get the helicopter. Send everyone. - Don't lose him. - His notebook. He tore out a page, but look what he wrote down. Deer Valley Lane. Lev Dellrayne is not a name. It's a trigger he left to remember her location. Took you long enough. - You alone? - For now. They'll be here soon. Where is she? I've got something. It looks like Deer Valley Lane dead-ends into a cattle ranch belonging to a Carl and Thelma Everett. What's their link to Rourke? There's nothing in the file. He must have hid Minnie with them all this time. It says here they had a foster kid 40 years ago. It's Rourke. Before this goes down, I need to know something. Why did you trust us with her? You taught me everything I know, Carl, including how to keep a moral compass pointed in the right direction. Is this going to work? If you're ready. You'd best get inside. Hi, Daddy. I set them up for you. I've missed you, baby. She's here. Read the signs, jackass. Private goddamn property. Hold your fire. We missed you, sweetheart. I don't know you. We love you like our own, Diana. But we'll still put a hole in you. You have my daughter and we're not leaving here without her. Kill them. Carl! No! Get medical. We need medical! We're not here for them. Where is she? Where's Minnie? Whatever Rourke has told you, it's a lie. She won't be safe until she's back with us at Division. That's where she belongs. That's not you talking. That's the Division. The Diana I know, the woman I love, wouldn't want this life for our little girl. Think about that. There's no escaping us. You know that. You know the consequences. There's only two ways this ends. You and Minnie come back to Division, or Minnie comes back without you. It's all right, sweetheart. Come on out. You're so big. You're safe now. You're safe. You still wear braids. I make them myself now. Of course you do. I'm so proud of you, Mommy. Proud of me for what? For coming home. We're setting ourselves free. From them. No. When did she... This isn't real. We're not here! It's a construct! It's her! Uh... You're doing this. I love you. I love you, too. I'm going to bring you back now. Close your eyes. Have you ever been in love? Where am I? Where am I? Have you ever been in love? Help! Where am I? Help! Help! Do you remember now, Mommy? When she was born, we prayed she wouldn't be like us. That she would be normal. But soon, we understood that the daughter of two powerful hypnotics would have an extraordinary gift. It would help the world explore the untapped abilities of the human mind. The Division realized that Minnie's power could transform society... Not to unlock human potential, but to force people to do what they were told... or else. They wanted Minnie to be their weapon. We wanted our daughter to be free, but we knew we could never outrun the Division. They would never let us go. The only way to escape any of them was to bring them all together, and destroy the Division completely. Wake up, sweetie. But we couldn't take them on ourselves. She wasn't ready yet. That's why we had to wait. Three years, maybe more. Then she'd be strong enough. That's when she'd send the trigger. Tip the first domino, to lead them out here... and kill them. And we knew the only way to keep our plan from the Division was to erase our own memories. Help! Where am I? Help! We reset ourselves and believed we loved each other so much, we would find each other again. Minnie and I, we're your most stubborn memories, the hardest ones to erase. I didn't want to let you go. Now you never have to. What now? We finally get to decide that for ourselves. We're free. We're finally free. Y'all go on ahead. I'll clean up here and follow you.
