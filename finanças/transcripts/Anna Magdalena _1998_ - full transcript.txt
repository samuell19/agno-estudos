Would you rather see him carrying a briefcase hanging his head and being ordered around? I knew this guy from Form 3 He's in my class and was a lot like Yau He acted though, skipped classes didn't do his homework Buy every time after class the girls would line to lend him their homework The next year the guy just quit I didn't know if he went to another school or what The girls turned funereal Even the teacher got depressed, losing a favorite punching bag Do you envy him?

What's so good about you? Mok Man Yee, open the door Mok Man Yee, open up Mok Man Yee, open up You got banaid? You got panadol?

He's not been back for a few days Come on. That's not him A few days ago, I did the most daring thing in my life It's always like this One minute I tell myself to stay clear of that sort, the next I throw myself into one The more I want to play smart the harder I fall It's been so many years Yet I still haven't learned Except for one thing Don't give him the chance to dump you, be initiative Is there a difference? Wonder how many betting centers there are in Hong Kong? Let's head back Are you not looking for him any more? I never said I was looking for him "Find Dog" I should never have moved in here The first time I laid eyes on him I knew it. Darn, I'm in heck. Was it that morning when he knocked on your door? It was that day when I went apartment hunting I looked out of the window and saw him come back from roller-skating He picked up a bottle of mineral water and doused himself And I said to the agent: I'll take it Can I play the piano? He never asked He just sat down and played I've found a job, I start the day after tomorrow And I've fallen in love with a girl But she wanted to dump me No girl has ever closed a door in my face Mok Man Yee, you're the first It's okay, I can do it Is the job permanent or temporary? Permanent, I guess Work hard and don't start hollering... Got you It's something I like Going to morning training, talking to trainers writing. It's easy enough Let me lend you an alarm clock You have to get up early for morning training Thanks putting me up for such a long time It's okay - One day when... - Yeah, Red Hill Peninsula "Fourth Movement, Variations" "Lingnam Publishing House" Tutu, articles for you A long-hair just went downstairs. Did you see him? These are for the editor You're the editor assistant. Pretty much the same "The Editor, Lingnam Publishing House" Let me find out where he went to school "The X O Pair written by Chan Kar-Fu" He got some nerve And he wanted to be a writer: can you believe it? Dump him. Do you have a bigger fish to fry? Are you still here? I'm almost ready to go Bye Friends, are you feeling lonely? My name is Chan Kar-Fu Would you like me to tell you a story? Once upon a time... In a faraway place called Town H Was a very old cathedral... One night, two uninvited guest suddenly appeared For orphans, the only way to improve their station in life was to study hard But... these two characters like to day-dream in class So they failed all their tests. One of them got a big zero The other got a big cross So one of them became known as Cross and the other, Zero It's obviously a children's story Why do you say it's a love story? Can you read? Finish it first He doesn't write well, but... He doesn't write very well yet you want me to finish it? If I read everything, I'll be here forever everlasting One good thing about this writer is that He doesn't know things like forever everlasting Do you mind looking at me when you speak to me? Why do you always keep your head down? You want something weird I think this one's pretty weird Dear listeners Do you find your work boring? Would you like some excitement? Why not go to the famous Haunted Ruins to look for gold? Those ruins have scared about 100 people to madness But no wonder Because invaluable treasures are known to be buried inside So are there really gold in the Haunted Ruins? And are the Haunted Ruins really haunted? The answer may be a riddle So if you're interested to be the 101 Hey, Mr. Mask Who called me? - Who called me just now? - Who is it? Who is it? Hey, Mr. Mask you're a dollar short What did you say? I asked you what did you say Cross? Zero? Did you make this costume yourself? Yours not so bad Hey, I'm here first But I opened the lock I'm here. Come in What? - There're... - What? Cockroaches You need more than a flash light going out in the evening Let's get out of here, I don't see any jewelry here If there was, it's all gone Wait - Wow, gold - We're rich Bingo. Congratulations Finally someone is able to claim my gold Now you can really live happily ever after Take it. Go on. Don't be afraid Take it all You so lucky, what's your hurry? I told you there's no such thing as a free lunch For all the gold that I've given you, I ask a small favor in return It's not too much to ask isn't it? See that music box? Take it, find this person And tell her "I love you Mok Man-Yee" Don't fail me Because if you do, I'll be on your heels to the end of the world So we're done playing Santa Claus Now what do we do with this? It's a gift for you So it's up to you I think you also have a share in it Be my guest, keep it No really. You be my guest. It looks better on you - No. You should have it - No, I don't want it No I mean... We spent all his gold We should do something for him in return He shouldn't asked people to say such corny things for him My god. So many Mok Man-Yees in Town H It'll take forever calling everyone of them There're only addresses here, no telephone numbers You don't say Just pick one at random Mouth it and call it quits That's right He's back again Just kidding Let's look for them one by one okay? You don't need to scare people all the time, do you? Poor chivalrous duo The first time they went out into the world and they met such fate Tutu, I beg you My boy has been crying all night and I didn't sleep a wink This really isn't a good time for me to read stupid stories But love stories are always stupid Do you think our readers will fall for this? Some stupid spook trying every way to get those two characters To find that Mok Man-Yee Maybe I am out of touch with love and romance these days But to me, the greatest love story will always be Dickens' "A Tale of Two Cities" Well, everyone has his or her way to express I think this Chan Kar-Fu is rather like Dickens in "A Tale of Two Cities" may be he's using an indirect way, to express his feelings for a certain individual All right, I'll finish it But promise me one thing Don't ever tell me again it's "A Tale of Two Cities" Is there a Miss Mok Man-Yee here? That's me The owner of this music box wishes to tell you "I love you" Is he rich? Go... That's me I don't think so The person we're looking for is a woman I was a woman, but now I'm a man You have a problem with that? We'll never find her Where on earth is the real Mok Man-Yee? That guy, he's really twisted He played cool when he was alive Now that he's dead he put the load on us Come to think of it "I love you" is really corny Imagine a big man Braving embarrassment to say it and getting no response whatsoever How terribly humiliating Obviously those three words are invented for men What about the women? If you love a men what do you say to him? She says nothing; she waits She lets the guy do the talking Then she says Hmm, me too. That's it Hey, do you remember this place? This song sounds familiar Haven't we heard it somewhere before? Over there "30624700..." We got it. We got it Mok Man-Yee is my aunt When I was young she used to play me a song In fact it's the same song over and over again She never got married It looks like all these years she was waiting for someone When I started making music myself she was already quite old Seeing that she's waited so many years I wrote a song and put the telephone number into the lyrics "30624700" If they are really meant for each other. Maybe... Where's your aunt now? She's passed away Didn't even wait for us "I love you Mok Man-Yee" My aunt's one no longer works. "I've known it all the time" I'm going Me too Here in this world every second there's someone out there Waiting to say those three words to someone, right? Which explains why florists do such good business Right. I know a business that's perfect for the two of us, Cross and Zero Us? "L-O-V-E Express" A Mr Romeo wishes to tell you: He loves you very much Get out of here. She's marrying me tomorrow Mr. Casanova sends us to tell you He's madly in love with you Go to die "How gentle is the rain" "that falls softly on the meadow" "Birds high up on the trees" "serenade the clouds with their melody" "Oh, see there beyond the hills," "the bright colors of the rainbow" "Some magic from above" "made this day for us just to fall in love" "You hold me in your arms," "and say once again you love me," "and if your love is true," "everything will be just as wonderful" "Now, I belong to you" "from this day until forever" "Just love me tenderly" "and I'll give to you every part of me" "Oh, don't ever make me cry" "through long lonely night without love?" "Be always true to me" "Keep this day in your heart eternally" "You hold me in your arms" "and say once again you love me," "and if your love is true" "everything will be just as wonderful" I've got something to tell It's alright, I've known it all along Some people find their Mok Man-Yee But some people don't That's the way it is It reads much better after you've edited it Are you not going home yet? You're unbelievable. Still working so hard after resignation I don't want my successor to handle my mess Do they pay you well over there? That's not the issue Right. People here are too conservative A smart woman like you should go and stretch your wings I really hate to see you go I think everyone here will miss you So maybe some other time Yes, I hope I can have the chance to work with you again All right then Good luck with your work I'm going It's raining outside It's okay. My car is parked I know, I always see you getting your car in the rain I have an extra umbrella. Please take it All right. Don't stay up too late "The X O Pair" So, what's up? Big-time writer? What's up? How did you do it? You never said you loved her So what even if I've told her? I just think it's plain stupid that you didn't Let's just say we travel on different roads Well you may want to go on forever on your road I'm moving on I'm moving This time, I'll be on my own. Now learning to pay my own rent Moving to Chai Wan. It's not too far away from Red Hill Peninsula "A Tale of Two Cities" "No promise of fair play.
