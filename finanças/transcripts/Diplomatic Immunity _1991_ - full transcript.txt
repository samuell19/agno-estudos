Yeah. There you go. You did great, kid. 'Cause I had a good teacher. Yeah. Are you gonna let me dive with my friends now? You betcha, kid. Anytime. There you go. You are looking more and more like your mother every day, you know that? Is that the Nazi? Not everyone who lives in Paraguay is an ex-Nazi. Oh. You told me not to judge a book by its cover. Oh, did I say that? Doesn't sound like me. Klaus is a real artist, Dad. I could learn a lot from him. Dad, this is Klaus Hermann. Mr. Hickel. I'm pleased to meet you. Ellen has told me all about you. She hasn't told me much about you. Well, I'm afraid I know more about Ellen than she does me. Perhaps tonight I'll fill her in. Well, we're late, Dad. Have a good time tonight. Thanks. Well? I don't think he likes me. I told you, he's very protective. You're a woman, not a child. You don't understand. Since my mother died, I'm all he has. Of course. I do understand. You like this? For technical reasons. The brush stroke. His use of darkness. The subject is a little grisly. No, actually, I find it quite weak. I don't think the artist has ever seen terror. Real terror. I hope your paintings aren't like this. Not at all. I never use guillotines. You know, if you wouldn't mind, I'd like to take some photos of you sometime. Why? I've been blocked on the face in my painting for weeks now, and I think yours might inspire me. Okay. When? Now? Oh. If you don't mind. Um, no. Where? I know a place. A stroll in the park, sir. Don't be too sure. (SCOFFS) He hasn't seen any action since Vietnam. I doubt if he's forgotten anything. We'll see. Move out. (MEN GROANING) It's all over, Sarge. (BEEPING) (BEEPING) (GRUNTS) It ain't over till it's over. KLAUS: Inspiring, isn't it? Yeah. It's not too dark up here, is it? I have a flash attachment. Try and let your hair down. That's it. Perfect. Good. Ah, beautiful. (CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS) Yes. That's good. A little smile? Good. That was nice, Klaus, but I just think that... Look, you're moving a little too fast, so... Klaus, stop it! Please! Stop it! (GRUNTING) (EXCLAIMS) I'm going to immortalize you, Ellen. (WHIMPERING) That's good, that's good. Hold that expression. Perfect. Oh, you're beautiful! That's good. That's good. Bitch. KLAUS: Get back here! (ELLEN SCREAMING) (PHONE BEEPING) NOLL: Klaus, is that you? Noll, I need your help. My car won't start. I think it's the battery. Call a repair shop. I can't. There's a girl. I wanted to take pictures, but she wouldn't cooperate. Oh, not again. You stupid little bastard, if it wasn't for your mother... WOMAN ON RADIO: Any unit in the vicinity of Washington and 1st, we have a line down... What the... (MAN CHATTERING ON RADIO) WOMAN ON RADIO: We copy, 21. Eighteen to dispatch. Go ahead, 18. Listen, I just saw a flash on the horizon. It could be a sparker. I'm gonna check it out before I go home, okay? 10-4, 18. Shit! What are you doing? She's the face for my painting, you idiot! We have to hide the body. I just need one more angle. (CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS) How dare you? You work for me, policeman. I work for your mother! Now, pick her up! Come on, damn it! Pick her up! (VEHICLE APPROACHING) Someone is coming! Let's go! Damn it! Come back here! Eighteen to dispatch. This is an emergency. Why are you slowing down? We don't want to get a speeding ticket, not now. WOMAN ON RADIO: All units, Hollywood division, be advised, white Mercedes, license 600... Get me out of here! Shut up! ...wanted in possible 187. (SIREN BLARING) Go! Go! Come on, go! OFFICER: Police, freeze! Everybody out! Nobody move! NOLL: Stop! I claim diplomatic immunity! We just heard from the units in the hills. Looks like a probable rape-murder. Take him. Take him! COP: Wait a sec! All right, let's go. NOLL: My credentials! Move it! We'll get that all straightened out down at the station after we book you. We can't do that. We're fucked. Yeah, I know. But I want everybody to know why we're fucked. (GASPING) She was assaulted. Evidently, she put up a fight. (RETCHING) (SOBBING) Homicide. Romero. Can I help you? (PEOPLE CHATTERING) Why doesn't someone tell me something? Did he kill her? I'm not supposed to say anything. (SIGHS) Shit. Listen, we got an eyewitness and some blood matches. But we had to release him to the Paraguay consulate. What? He's got diplomatic immunity. Technically, we have no jurisdiction. I'm sorry. OFFICER: Hey! Pull over! Hangar five. Go ahead. Hey! Hey, what the hell, man? KLAUS: It's her father! Back up! Back up! Bitch! Damn it! KINNICK: All nations subscribe to the principle of diplomatic immunity. For murder? There are larger issues here, Sergeant Hickel. We are entering into human rights negotiations with Paraguay. It could result in a positive social change for an entire country. Yeah, and the price is my daughter's life? An unfortunate way to look at it. Yeah, well, maybe the press will look at it that way, too. Going to the press would not-- would not be in the national interest at this time, Sergeant Hickel. It may take time, but the state department is trying to arrange extradition. And if they can't? There are limits as to what a nation can do. Well, sometimes a man can do more. You're lucky to hit anything with that old piece of slag. You gonna chew me out, Captain Ferguson? I don't have the right. But that mess at the airport... I've never known you to start an operation without a plan. Yeah. Well, I wasn't thinkin' too good. Well, personally, if it was me, I'd go to Paraguay and find the cocksucker. But officially, I have to tell you don't do it. Do you need anything? I can't be Cole Hickel anymore. Hmm. Well, I know a man. Hmm. I'll let you know. (PEOPLE CHATTERING) (HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYING ON JUKEBOX) You lost, man? Lookin' for Del Ray Goines. Who wants him? Cole Hickel. Joe Ferguson sent me. Reggie, watch the bar till I come back. Hey, cool out. He's all right. Fergie still smokin' those shitty cigars? Like a chimney. You're Charlie Harvey now. Who's Cowboy? Somebody I heard about in Asuncion. Used to fly contraband into South America for the company, now he deals black market guns and anything else you might need. How much do I owe you? Put your money away, friend. Fergie told me what this is about. I've got a daughter, too. Drinks are on the house. Hey, what did I just tell you? Hey, I always tip my bartender. Okay, come on. Hey, Del Ray. Hmm? Who was you talkin' to? Just a guy goin' down a one-way street. I don't know, old buddy. In Nam, we pulled each other out of the fire lots of times. But, uh, you've been on the shelf too long. You could have joined the company when I did, but you wanted out of clandestine work. Stay out. This is political. It's not political, it's personal. You know, Cole, after, uh, what went down between us, I never figured I'd see you again. I'm glad you came to me for help. I'm sorry as hell about Ellen. I know how close you two were. What can I do for you? (CLEARING THROAT) You supervise the field ops in that part of the world. Could you use the company's computers to get me information? I got a better idea. Let me pull a few strings at my end. We'll get that asshole back here for trial. But I need some time. Okay. Sure. See what you can do. Attaboy! And, uh... Anything else I can do, you call. Yeah, thanks. Cole. Make sure you don't go down there. (SPEAKING SPANISH) Hmm... What brings you to Paraguay, senor Harvey? Uh, business. Okay. Have a good time. (BOTH SPEAKING SPANISH) (WOMAN CHATTERING ON PA IN SPANISH) WOMAN ON PA: Attention, passengers of Alas Paraguayas flight 45 en route to Concepcion. We will now begin boarding at gate number 10. (WOMAN CHATTERING ON PA IN SPANISH) I think we have found the man who's in that picture. He's right outside. Attention, passengers, this is the final boarding call for Aerolineas Australes, flight number 700. That's him. Let's go. Security! Security! (MAN YELLING IN SPANISH) Hey. (PEOPLE YELLING) Get out of the way! Get out of the way! (GUARD SHOUTING IN SPANISH) (WOMAN SCREAMS) (EXCLAIMING) (GUNS FIRING) (EXCLAIMS) Very good, Stefan. Yes, I still have a lot to learn, obviously. Um... Serrano from Internal Security gave me this. You might want to take a look at it. So Daddy is still alive. He's a very lucky man. I don't think luck has a lot to do with it. That man is a Marine. Yes, he does like aquatic sports, doesn't he? That man trains Marines. So what can one man do? Hey! (SPEAKING SPANISH) (BOTH SPEAKING SPANISH) (SIREN BLARING) Come on, faster! Faster! Come on. Get... (SPEAKING SPANISH) (DRIVER PLEADING IN SPANISH) (EXCLAIMING IN SPANISH) (HONKING HORN) (SCREAMING) (SPEAKING SPANISH) (SPEAKING SPANISH) He's good. We'll find him. We'd better. (WHIRRING) (DOG BARKING) (ROCK MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO) Hello? Hello? Hey, amigo. Are you the boss around here? No, no, no. I don't want a truck. I'm lookin' for Cowboy. (BUZZING) I'm Charlie Harvey. American, huh? Pretty rare bird around these here parts. You Cowboy? You wanna rent a truck, take your pick. If not, take a hike. I got a whole lot of other things to do. Look, I need a weapon. Haven't you heard? It's against the law for civilians to own weapons in this country. Yeah, but I'll pay. You're not listenin' to me. I rent trucks. Get the hell out of here before I call the cops. Del Ray Goines told me that Cowboy sells guns to foreigners. Now, if you're not him, you won't mind me walkin' around the neighborhood askin' for him, right? Adios. Hey! Come on back in here. That is Fiji. Heaven on Earth. Someday soon. Now, what is it exactly that you think I'm sellin'? Weapons and information. You wouldn't be from, uh, Internal Security, would ya? I'm just lookin' to make a deal, man. Well... You know what I think? I think... (GUN COCKING) Arturo! All right. Who the hell are you really? And you snap it up, because I'm a busy man. Cole Hickel, and I need a gun. What for? To kill a man. What man? Klaus Hermann. He killed my daughter. (GUN CLICKING) Take your pick. Come on, though, let's snap it up. I got other things to do. No, no, no, no, no, no... That is the peanut gallery. Now, this... This is a real weapon. No, this is the one I want. And this, too. I like your attitude, but, uh, don't be insulted, I gotta ask for the money up front. WOMAN: Thank you again, General, for your help with this unfortunate matter. Yes, until Wednesday night, then. Goodbye. No more calls. My dear son. Do you realize how difficult it was to get assurance that there would be no extradition? And if Stefan had not acted so quickly, you would be rotting in an American jail. Once again, you have him to thank. For what, taking my place in this family? Stefan, will you leave us for a moment? I'll call you. Now... Why... Why do you say that Stefan is taking your place? I just don't understand why you waste yourself on those sluts. The Hermann house is on an island in the middle of the Paraguay river. It's like a damn fortress. It is complete with dogs, a private army, and you can't get there except by boat. Well, I never said it was gonna be easy. I'll have to take him out somewhere in the city. Now, that means that you gotta go through Stefan Noll first. He runs the company muscle. He used to be with Internal Security, still got contacts with the local police. And then... Then that leaves Gerta Hermann. She's like a damn queen around here. She got half of parliament right inside her pocket. Used to be a stripper, then she married some munitions money. When old man Hermann passed away, she was left set for life. I'll tell you one thing. Nobody fucks with Gerta. Tell me more about Klaus. This is, uh, Klaus Hermann's specialty when he's slumming. (SCOFFS) He's a real artist. Oh, a lot of people think so. You know, what I think is that they're just afraid of getting on his mommy's bad side. Look at that inside page. COWBOY: That face... That appears over and over and over again in all his paintings. Looks an awful lot like Gerta Hermann. Hey, what do you think Freud would think about that? The one on the front... Now, that is Teresa Escobal, that's his mistress. He spends an awful lot of time with her. Almost every night. How do you know? Well, it is my business to know. COLE: What's her address? COWBOY: 2023, Avenida de la Quinata. Top floor, southwest corner. Apartment 6. (CRACKLING) (GRUNTING) I want Klaus Hermann. He's not here! I swear! (COCKING GUN) No! Please. I just want to take this off. All right. Some people prefer a lover without a face so they can concentrate on the body. Now, is Klaus coming over tonight? No. Hmm. We'll see. You don't move. What is this for? Maybe you'd like to tie me up. You'd probably like it too much. TERESA: You want to kill him, don't you? Just shut up. I am trying to think. Why? I said be quiet, will ya? Tell me, what did he do that should cost him his life? He murdered my daughter. I don't believe it. Well, you wouldn't. He bought you. You don't know what you're talking about. I'm not a prostitute! Oh. We play at violence here. I punish and I forgive. So you're the best he can do for a conscience, huh? Klaus is too submissive. He could never hurt your daughter. (COCKING GUN) You just shut up. Okay, now get in there and shut up. (SNIFFLING) Well, well, what a surprise. Welcome to Paraguay, Mister... Mr. Harvey, isn't it? I'm impressed. We didn't expect you quite so soon. I had to stop by and warn senorita Escobal that you might turn up. I, uh... I usually knock, but tonight I had Klaus's key. Well, you got this far. (DOOR OPENS) (BOTH GRUNTING) (CRACKLING) (SCREAMING) (PANTING) (GROANING) Whatever they're paying you to clean up after that punk ain't enough. (CHUCKLING) Stefan, I didn't think you were into this. What are you doing here? I told you I was taking Teresa to the opening. I'm not going to let the American ruin that pleasure for me. Idiot! It was the American who did this. He could come back any moment. Now get me out of this! (TECHNO-POP MUSIC PLAYING) (PEOPLE CHATTERING) (PEOPLE APPLAUDING) (COCKS GUN) Good to see you again. Klaus, I need to talk to you. Excuse me. Why didn't you call the police? With my record? Look at you. How could you come here like that? Hey, I didn't have to come here. I was worried about you. Come on. Something happened in California, Klaus. Another earthquake? That man said you... He said you hurt his daughter. And you believed him, right? No! No, I told... You dare touch me like that? Let's go! (ALARM RINGING) (GRUNTING) (PEOPLE YELLING) (COUGHING) Come on, Klaus. Take him away! This way! Down here! (SIRENS WAILING) (HORN HONKING) He almost got me! I warned you about him! I cannot keep you alive unless from now on you do exactly as I tell you! Where is Teresa? She went with him. Do you have any idea where she may have taken him? I don't know! Well, think! He had a US Military-issue .45. It was new. You can't get those from anywhere. Now, tell Serrano to put a tap on all the local suspects. (TECHNO-POP MUSIC PLAYING ON JUKEBOX) (PEOPLE WHOOPING) Why did you help me? You were right about Klaus. When I confronted him about your daughter, he tried to kill me. Just take it easy, all right? Look, you got any friends you can stay with until this is all over? In my business, you don't make too many real friends. Maybe you ought to get out of that business. How about family? A father. Can you stay with him? No. He wouldn't want me. Why not? Because he hates me. Yeah, well, maybe he disapproves of your lifestyle. Look, you don't know anything about me. And neither does he. Hey, I was just trying to help. I'm sorry. It's just hard for me to talk about my father. Yeah, well, we've gotta find you some place to stay. You know, you should get out, too. No, not yet. They'll kill you if you stay. Cancer killed my wife, and I couldn't fight that. This punk goes and kills my daughter, that I can fight. You... You must have loved her very much. I gotta make a call. You stay right here. If you have to, use it. Okay? Okay. (DIALING) COWBOY: Diaz rentals. Cowboy? I got a problem. And I've got Teresa with me. COLE: Do you have a place I can take her where she'll be safe? COWBOY: Yeah, but this is gonna cost you, man. Okay, okay. Just tell me the address. You take the N4-1 to, uh, Cielo Canyon. Then you find a ranch house at the end of the access road. What are you gonna do, Cole? Look, man, I missed the target twice in neutral territory. I am going inside the Hermann munitions factory. And I need some more ammo. (CHUCKLES) Sounds kind of risky to me, Cole. After I drop Teresa off, I'll meet you there at midnight. You got that? COWBOY: Yeah, but be on time, 'cause I got lots of other things to do. (GUNS FIRING) (PEOPLE SCREAMING) (GROANING) (WOMAN SCREAMS) (GRUNTS) Teresa! I'm okay! (CLICKING) Say goodbye. Drop it or I'll kill you. Now! (COCKING GUN) Cole, no! You tell Noll that the girl is out of this now. Okay? It's just between me and Klaus. Anybody else gets in my way, I swear to God I'll kill 'em. You hear me? Get in the other side. Sorry, pal. Come on, open the door! (MAN YELLING IN SPANISH) How's your leg? It's okay. It's just a graze. Let's worry about you first, huh? Now, look, I got this friend. He has a place outside of town. I'm gonna take you there. You'll be safe. Okay. It's gonna be okay. Oh, God. (COCKING GUN) Hey. (GUN CLICKING) You made me late for my next appointment. I gotta charge you extra. Could you hustle this up? I got a lot of other things to do today. Tonight's my last shipment. As soon as I unload it, I am Fiji-bound. There. Hey, believe me, it's beautiful over there this time of year. Hey, I got an idea. Why don't you give me the rest of that money and let me blow your brains out? Save you a lot of effort. I got a few things to do before I die, my friend. Well, try and find a good use for it. Thanks. I'm gonna miss ya. You're becoming my favorite customer. Good luck, pal. (PHONE RINGING) Serrano here. (MAN CHATTERING IN SPANISH ABOUT COWBOY) (AGREES IN SPANISH) (MACHINE GUNS FIRING) (MEN YELLING) (MAN SHOUTING IN SPANISH) STONEY: You got an appointment? Stoney. I expected you sooner, old buddy. I guess the skirt slowed you down. I always told you, never carry too much gear. You're a part of this? I'm all of it. It's my job, remember? The country of Paraguay and the United States have a long history of cooperation. You have tangled the delicate political threads. I have come down to untangle them. How'd you know I'd come here? This country is not big on civil rights. It didn't take long for Internal Security to tap a phone. So what about Klaus, huh? What happens to him? He's no longer your concern. And Cowboy and the girl? That's Internal Security's business. You're mine. That's the deal. (GUN COCKING) Don't be a hero. Mr. Wyler. My associate's been looking over your shoulder since you got here. Oh, you've perfected your style, Stoney. You got betrayal down to an art. Just like Moc Hoa. Shut up. You see, he doesn't like to talk about Moc Hoa. They were just kids, but Stoney here saw things differently. They were the enemy, too much gear to carry. I'm warning you. Four ten-year-old boys, one after the other. Just like he was swatting flies! Son of a bitch! (GRUNTING) Cole! No! (GUN FIRING) If he's gets away... I'm just following my orders. What are you doing? (GROANING) (MAN YELLING IN SPANISH) (YELLING IN SPANISH) (SPEAKING IN SPANISH) COLE: I thought you were dead. I was late. It took me all night to get rid of that shipment. Damn! Gerta Hermann! Yeah. They know where Teresa is. I have to go. I'll take you. What? Right on my way to Fiji. KLAUS: Rise and shine, Teresa. (CHUCKLING) (GASPING) Say cheese, Teresa. (GROANING) Ah, good. COLE: Good, we're here. That's enough foreplay. You're ready for penetration, Teresa! No! TERESA: No! Fuck! TERESA: Cole! Go get him! I got her. Damn it. Cole! (SOBBING) What happened? Lost him. You drive. All right. What have you got in there? These are my emergency rations. I got money and I got ammunition. How much you want for 'em? Ain't for sale. I'm goin' with you. Oh? Where? Goin' wherever the Hermanns are. Well, I was right. They're on the island. The old man's got a boat we can buy. What about her? The old man, he'll take her up river for us for a price. Cole, please take me with you. No, no, no, no. Listen, I want you to start clean. Hey, you were right, he didn't know. Who? Your father. Is she gonna work? It'll do. You have caused me to strain my good relationship with the government once too often. Do they have to be here? They know your shortcomings almost as well as I do. But I want to talk to you alone. I'll tell the guards to watch for the American. This time, you do your job. (MOANING) You're so desperate for love. You inspire nothing but hate. (MUFFLED CRIES) (DOGS BARKING) (PHONE RINGS) Yeah. Gephardt. GERTA: I hear the dogs barking. Check them immediately. Right away. (DOGS BARKING) (EXCLAIMS) Klaus? Is that you? Klaus, open up. Why do you always do this? Why do you always lock the door? You know I can go get the master key if I want to. All right. Have it your way, you little shit. Where is Klaus? He's, uh... He's outside pouting somewhere, I think. Let's give him something to pout about. (DOGS BARKING) I found blood in the courtyard. I think someone is still out there! What are you doing? Both of you stay here. You could look more worried. I think you just wanted me all to yourself. (THUDDING) Who invited you into my house? Do you know who I am? Every beautiful inch of you. Thanks to baby boy there. You're both crazy. How do you expect to get out of here? The same way you will. KLAUS: Please don't. I'm sick! I didn't know what I was doing! Neither do I. (HELICOPTER APPROACHING) Ah, the Americans. (GUN COCKING) (GUN FIRES) Just like the cavalry. (GUN FIRES) (CHUCKLING) (SPITS) GERTA: Oh, such manners, Klaus. Would you please see the gentleman out? With pleasure. (GROANING) (GROANING) I should have let you kill him. (GUN FIRES) He's coming! Get him! Go! Hurry up! This is for you, Ellen. Give it up, Cole! Drop it! Drop it! The war's over, Cole. Throw it away. Don't give me an excuse. You had to do it, didn't you, Cole? Political fortunes to be made, and your private little war took over. I've had enough of your righteous meddling. WYLER: What are you gonna tell Washington? What I say happened on this island, happened. Our directive was to contain him... Get away from me! (STONEY YELLING) (COLE EXCLAIMING) (BOTH GRUNTING) (GUN FIRES) Sorry, I have to follow orders. Get up. I'm too tired. You'll have to kill me right here. All right. Yeah. He exceeded his authority. Bad habit of his. Yeah. No. No, you stay, they'll kill ya. And Klaus will still be alive. What good will that do? Give me a hand with him. Come on. Say cheese. (CHUCKLES) (GRUNTING) (BEEPING) (SCREAMING) You sure you have to take me back to the States? Where would you go? I'd kind of like to see Fiji. I hear it's beautiful there this time of year. (WOMAN CHATTERING ON PA IN SPANISH) Hello. (SPEAKING SPANISH) Internal Security, Mr. Hickel. (SPEAKING SPANISH) You have to come with us. Oh, I'm sorry, that's quite impossible. You see, Mr. Hickel has the standing of Consular Official at large. We invoke the principle of diplomatic immunity. (SPEAKING SPANISH) Mr. Hickel.
