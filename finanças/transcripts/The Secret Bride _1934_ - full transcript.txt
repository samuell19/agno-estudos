To love, honor and cherish as long as you both shall live. I do. By virtue of the authority invested in me as. Justice of the Peace of Carlyle County, I pronounce you man and wife. That'll be five dollars please, is the regular fee too. I could charge you ten seeing it's so early. Could you stretch the regular fee to include a telephone call? No sir, it's a big telephone in the corridor. Thanks. Well, how does it feel? I don't know, it's a little like taking a step on the door, thinking as a short step. - And finding out it's the elevator shaft. - Hey, wait a minute. - Maybe it's not legal. - What's the matter? You can't walk over there, I just mopped that side. - Oh, we're very sorry. - We're very sorry. - Oh George, we have to use the phone. - No, I just mopped that side sir. Well. Long distance please. Your father is going to get the surprise of his life. Oh, no, not over the phone. - I'd rather we tell him. - You're right. That may turn out to be your most annoying habit. - What? - Being right. I'll call my office. Long distance? Give me City 3700. I suppose this will be in the papers by the time we get back to town. Don't get delusions of grandeur my love. You may be the governor's daughter in your own state. But in Carlyle County you're just a scared pretty girl getting married. Well, thanks for the pretty. Hello. Hello, how much? I noticed particularly they never batted an eye at your name. Nor at yours, by the way. Attorney General's office. Oh hello Mr. Sheldon, did you have a nice trip? Oh, that's grand. Well, it's been raining here ever since you left. - Let me talk to him. - I'll be in by eleven. Who? Breeden? Alright, put him on. It's urgent Mr. Sheldon, I have to see you as soon as possible. I can't tell you over the phone. I got a tip and I'm going to act on it at once. Yes, is plenty hot. Alright, goodbye. Plenty hot, eh? What is it? I... love you. I never felt less like working. To spend the first day when I've the right to be with you, grumping in an office. What are you going to do while I pretend to keep my mind on my job? Oh, I think I'll do a little shopping. Get yourself a ring, will you? I hate not being with you but it can't be helped. I'll get through at the office as quickly as I can and come over at the house. - Ready to ask father for my hand? - In the traditional manner. - Suppose he says no? - Well, suppose he does? We're married already so we should worry. - Good morning sir. - Count that please. Certainly. - Ten thousand even. - Great. We have two accounts for this name sir. You wish this credited to the personal account or... Personal account, give me a duplicate deposit slip please. Certainly. There you are sir. - Thank you. - Just a minute. You'll have to come along with me Mr. Martin. What's the meaning of this? Who are you? - I suppose I must go with you. - You suppose right Mr.Martin. - What do you want with me? - You'll find out, come along. Will you permit me to send a phone call? - You going to call your lawyer? - Any objection? None at all, go right ahead. Good morning Miss Normandie. - Good morning Mr. Sheldon. - Hello Mr. Sheldon, may I see you a minute? Why not? Come in. You seem all steamed up this morning. Was it something on the phone? What's on your mind? Ten thousand dollars deposit to the personal account of Governor Vincent. - Well, what of it? - By J.F. Holdstock. What makes you think it's Holdstock? There's no name on the slip. Well, you know there's been a lot of talk ever since the governor pardoned Holdstock. There's talk about every man in public life. For all I know there's talk about me. But no amount of talk would convince me that Governor Vincent would take a bribe. I had a straight tip on it last night. And this morning I picked up Holdstock's secretary on the act of making a deposit. - Where is he? - In there. - Bring him in. - Yes sir. Come on. - Sit down Mr. Martin. - No. When did Mr. Holdstock give you this money to deposit? He telephoned me at the office this morning from his home... and instructed me to take the money from his safe and deposit it... to the governor's account at once, which I did. Do you know of any legitimate business transaction... between Mr. Holdstock and Governor Vincent which would explain so large a deposit? None has gone through my hands. Did you think it at all odd that you were told to deposit this money in cash... to the personal account of the governor of this state? I consider that Mr. Holdstock's business and still do, I may add. It probably is. Well, thank you Mr. Martin, we needn't detain you longer. - You mean I can go? - Yes, you can run along, We'll call you when you're needed. Get Holdstock down here, I'm going over to the Governor's residence. - Yes sir. - Call me there when you've got him. Very good. Alright Dad, you can go back to governing this sovereign state. Well, I shall expect a full account of your doings when I get home. See you later, bye-bye. Come in. - Mr. Sheldon is in the drawing room miss. - Thank you. Hello darling, I just phoned father, he'll be right over. We are going to have our wedding day together after all, aren't we? Look... Darling, I've got some very bad news for you about your father. What happened? I'd give anything in the world if I didn't have to tell you this. But I wanted to talk it over with you before I went to your father with it. Go on dear. Breeden got a tip that John Holdstock... Oh, don't tell me they're bringing that pardon business up again? This morning Holdstock's private secretary deposited 10,000 dollars in cash... to your father's private account. There's a perfectly simple explanation for that. They probably had some business transaction. - That's what I thought at first but... - But what? Well, it just doesn't seem very likely that your father would've any... business dealings with a man he just pardoned. - You don't think that father could... - Of course not darling. We know it's impossible but it doesn't look impossible. That's what we're up against. Well... How are you involved in this officially? I've got to lay the information I have before the House of Representatives... unless Holdstock can explain everything. Oh, it's ridiculous of us to worry, I'm sure Mr. Holdstock will explain. - Mr. Breeden on the wire for you sir. - Thank you. Yes hello Breeden. - Say that again. - What is it Bob? Holdstock is committed suicide. - Suicide? - Yes, go on. He committed suicide sometime this morning as far the coroner can tell. What? Just a minute, I'll find out. Hey Martin... That was Holdstock that you called up from the bank this morning, it wasn't your lawyer, You told him I'd picked you up, didn't you? I had your permission, it is my duty to tell Mr. Holdstock what had happened. Hello Mr. Sheldon. Yes, you were right. As he told us a lot more by bumping himself off... than we ever gotten from him on the witness stand. Yes sir, it's all sewed up for the Legislative Investigation Committee. - Every thread tied. - Alright Breeden. The news of Holdstock's suicide will go to the newspapers at once. And if they get hold of the fact that his secretary was... questioned by your office this morning... The House will demand from me a full account of everything I know. And the fact that I've delayed even this long may be extremely serious for me. Who knows about this except you and Breeden? I don't know. The reporters are swarming over Holdstock's house right now. To find a motive for his suicide. The Attorney General is not in his office sir. - Keep after that number. - Yes sir. - Good morning sir. - Good morning. - Good morning WH. - Good morning Jim. Have you read that? Didn't take them long to get it on the streets. You got the greatest weapon in the world to fight with, innocence. Yes, I'm innocent. But the opposition leaders are framing articles of impeachment right now. It's only one thing against you WH. You're not a rich man, that's what makes it look bad. Oh, everyone knows you financed my campaign. If I'm hard up I can come to you for all the money I need. I don't have to sell out for a measly ten thousand. Did Holdstock ever offer to lend you any money? Yes but of course I refused it. Now I'm tortured by the thought that the poor misguided... devil deposited that money as a last friendly gesture before killing himself. Friendly gestures from pardoned felons are dynamite. Holdstock should've known how the thing would look. Why should he have killed himself? The press contends that it was because the supposed bribe was discovered. But I know what the man had been through, he pretty well wrecked his life. Jim, this is going to be a fight to the finish. Well, we had a battle to put you into office... and we'll give them a bigger battle before they put you out. Would you telephone this number Mr. Lansdale? Thank you. - Excuse me Walter. - You get the Attorney General yet? No sir. Never mind, I've got to go to his office anyway. You say Sheldon is over there now, at the Executive Mansion? Alright, keep in touch with me. Jim, what's the idea of using a public phone? You know you can always use mine. No, I make it a point not to sponge on the taxpayers. I want to get in touch with Sheldon. His office uncover all this mess. You'll be laughing at this thing in a week WH. What you need most is to quit worrying. Come on, we're going over the club and get some lunch. - Any statement for the press Governor? - All I have to say I've already said. Any questions the investigating committee puts to me I'll answer with complete candor. Yes sir. It is expected that a committee will be appointed to investigate charges of... bribe taking made against Governor Vincent as a result of sensational disclosures... which have come to light in connection with the suicide this morning... of John F. Holdstock, convicted embezzler recently pardoned by the governor. - Luncheon is served miss. - Has my father come in yet Oakley? Not yet miss. Goodbye darling. I think I'd better be getting back to the office. - Bob, will you listen to a hunch? - Yes, if it's a good one. In the first place, I shall believe Father... when he denies all knowledge of this supposed bribe. So shall I but that's having faith in a man we both admire and trust. - That's not a hunch. - But this is... Holdstock is supposed to have committed suicide because his bribe was discovered. But isn't it possible that he could've killed himself... in remorse when he found out he'd been made a party to a frame up? A man doesn't kill himself to make a frame up look convincing. No, they'll sift every grain of evidence against your father... - and they have plenty to work on. - Now look here. While the legislature is investigating my father... why don't you investigate Holdstock and his associates? That is a hunch, we'll play that to the limit. Can you, in your position? Well yes, I can work on this Holdstock angle. And we can only hope that by the time the legislature is ready to question your... father and me we'll have a complete story to give them. And when we get the complete story it'll vindicate Father. - I hope so. - Oh, you know it. But Bob, if... if you're going to do everything you can to clear Father, then... Yes? - Nobody must know we're married. - I'm afraid you're right. If it were known that Governor Vincent was my father in law... no one would credit me with any disinterested motive. - What is it darling? - Oh, I'm sorry. It's silly of me to feel this way but... - I did look forward to our little ceremony. - So did I. Keep this for me... until we can tell Dad as we planned. Hello Martin, you busy? I am very. I'm doing the best I can to wind up Mr. Holdstock's affairs. - What do you want? - A court order to open Mr. Holdstock's safe. - What's he after? A suicide motive? - I guess so. - That's all there is. - It's all I want. - Where are you talking all those? - The Attorney General. Do you mind if I go with you? You afraid the attorney general will steal something? No, come right ahead. Get out that inventory, I'll be back as soon as possible. Mr. Martin, are you familiar with the contents of this folder? No sir, those would be some of Mr. Holdstock's private and personal papers. I see. - Telegram for Mr. Sheldon. - Yes, here. Hey, since when did you start playing around with big children's toys? - Isn't that nice? - What's the idea? Oh, that's just for protection. Now listen beautiful, I'm protection enough for any gal. No kidding, I don't like you to have guns lying around. Guns and you don't go together, I'll mind it for you. Say, listen, I might need that. You say you know nothing of the contents of this particular file? No sir. Very well, I needn't detain you any further. - I may go back to the office then? - Yes, yes. - Anything important among those papers? - No, nothing. Miss Normandie order my car, if anyone asks for me, you don't know where I am. You found this letter in Holdstock's safe? Yes but you're the only one who knows I have it. It could be a forgery. If it isn't, it's the worst evidence against your father that could have turned up. Oh, what are you going to do? Where is the machine on which your father's personal letters are written? In his study. What shall I type? Oh, anything, just a word or two, it doesn't matter. It's very simple for police experts to identify typewriting. I'll take this down to Police Headquarters myself. Bob, the result of this test is terribly important to Father. - Please let me go with you. - Of course. - Governor Vincent just came in miss. - Is he alone? Mr. Lansdale is with him miss. - Will you tell him I'll be back later? - Very good miss. Very well Mr.Sheldon... if you let me have the specimens, I'll make the necessary comparisons. Here is one. And for the other... would the typed address on the envelope be sufficient? Certainly. You understand lieutenant, this is highly confidential. - I'm asking it of you as a personal favor. - Surely. I'm glad to do it. How long will it take? I'll have them ready for you in a half hour Mr. Sheldon. Thank you. Is there a place nearby where one can get a bite to eat? There's a lunchroom across the street if you want to take a chance on it. I'll send an officer over as soon as my tests are ready. Thanks, that'll be fine. - He'll make the tests. - Good. Now I'm going to take you across the street and feed you. Oh really Bob, I'm not hungry, I couldn't eat a thing. My dear, there isn't a thing in the world... that you can do to help your father in the next half hour. In the State Legislature today the House of Representatives, after a stormy debate... appointed a committee to investigate charges of bribery... Turn that thing off please, got anything else? The opposition seemed confident that the House will shortly draw... It looks like they finally caught up with Vincent. - They haven't proved anything on him yet. - They will. - Natural. - Do you shoot dice? - Shall I show you? - Yes. Hey, wait a minute, use these. Don't be marking up my sugar. - Thank you, are these loaded? - No, I got a deck of marked cards though. These will do. - Shoot you for the check? - It's a bet. Right. - Seven. - I'll give you a chance to get even. - Shoot. - Right. Yours. You're lucky. That's the second pass you've made. - This is my lucky day. - In spite of everything? Because of one thing. Shoot away but we use my dice. - Mr. Sheldon, they're ready. - Oh, thank you. Hey, wait a minute pal. - You're a citizen, ain't you? - Sure. Well, he can't take you in without a warrant. - Make him show a warrant. - Come on. What's the matter? There just ain't no justice. - Come in Mr.Sheldon. - I have Miss Vincent with me. - Oh, come in Miss Vincent, take a seat. - Thanks. These tests I'm about to show you are very interesting. Now, I want you to watch these letters very carefully. There is a series from the piece of paper which I've marked with a dot. And there is a series from the envelope. They're identical. But wouldn't these letters look the same from any other machine of the same make? Oh no, look. There is a series of letters made on the same make of machine but in perfect condition. Is there no question about it? With this number of characteristics, there can be no doubt. - Can I be of any further help to you? - That's enough. - Here are your specimens Mr. Sheldon. - Thanks. - Good night Lieutenant. - Good night. Don't worry my dear. We'll see your father and hear what he has to say. No please, I'd rather see him alone first. Alright then, you show him the letter yourself. - Good night. - Good night. - Has my father gone to bed yet? - Yes miss. - Well. Who is it? - It's Ruth Father. Oh, come in my dear. - You've heard everything of course. - Everything. I flattered myself I was a seasoned campaigner. I never found politics a kid glove business but somehow I can't shake this off. Thirty years' service to the state. Always giving them the best I've got. And now they're willing to think I'd sell a pardon. Oh well, we have to take the cards as they're dealt, I suppose. But come now, tell me about yourself. You have a nice trip? Father, there's much more evidence in this case than has reached the papers. What do you mean? They went through Holdstock's safe this afternoon. - Who did? Sheldon's men? - Yes. Why didn't Bob come to me? Because I asked him not to. I asked him to let me tell you. - Did Holdstock leave a suicide note? - No, this was in his private file. - These are my initials. - Yes. You know of course, that the expense of... maintaining my stock farm has exceeded the income during the year. In view of past favors I feel sure that you will understand me... when I remind you that the time for the matter we discussed has come. But I never wrote this letter. - Father, I... - It's a forgery. Father... I think you ought to know that Bob Sheldon and I took that letter with a... sample of typewriting from the machine in your study down to police headquarters. The test proved it was written on your machine. I saw the comparison made. - Does Bob Sheldon think I wrote this letter? - He didn't until he saw the test. And you Ruth? Do you believe this of me? Please try to understand, tell me you didn't write that letter. Tell me so I can't doubt you. We've been very close together all your life, haven't' we? Always. You know I pardoned Holdstock, you know he deposited money in my account. You've seen this test, that's evidence. - Evidence of my guilt. - Yes. What you want of me now is evidence of my innocence. I must've it, father. All the evidence I can give you is just my word of honor. I know nothing of this bribe, I did not write that letter. - Do you believe me, my dear? - Yes, I believe you. - No doubt left? - No doubt left. Hello Martin. - What's the matter with you? - Thank God is you. - What you afraid of? - Everything. When I saw your shadow on that door, I keep thinking there's someone behind me. All day long, everywhere I turn. And those questions, everybody asking me questions. But you have nothing to worry about, it's almost over. I've seen you through the day as I've promised, haven't I? Of course you may still have to go before the investigating committee. No, I can't, I can't go through it again, I tell you. - I may go crazy. - Ah, don't be silly. You were splendid today in Sheldon's office. You just stick to your story and remember that I'm taking care of you. - I'm afraid. - Oh, pull yourself together. You come with me and I'll fix up those jitters. Hello sweets, what time shall I call for you? Well, I ought to be through by 11 o'clock, I think Mr. Sheldon will be back by then. Ok, I'll be outside the apartment 11 o'clock. Don't work too hard, goodbye. - Oh, good evening Mr. Sheldon. - Sorry Hazel, I didn't expect to be so late. Oh, that's all right. I've looked up all those case references, - You'll find them clipped and marked. - That's fine. I got a good of work tonight so you may as well go home. - I'll just look up this last reference. - Alright, thanks. Oh, Ruth? Has anything happened? Yes, I couldn't wait until morning to tell you. My secretary is working in there, let's go in here. Bob, any shadow of doubt I may have had was swept away when I talked to him. But the fact remains that this letter was written on your father's machine. Oh, a dozen people could've had access to that typewriter. - I suppose they could. - Dad never kept his study locked. Don't you see? What we really have is the clearest... kind of evidence of a plot against father. First the bank deposit made without the slightest knowledge on Dad's part. - Then Holdstock's suicide. - Yes but I can't fit that in. Why not? Holdstock found out he'd been made party to a frame up. He was deeply grateful to father, they were lifelong friends. He couldn't face the realization that he'd done anything to discredit Dad... - so he shot himself. - But the letter? Oh, carefully planted, written on Dad's typewriter. Oh Bob, I know he's innocent. Somebody wants to drive him out of office. If we can only uncover that plot before the legislature actually proceeds to impeachment. We must. I'm sure your father and I will be subpoenaed tomorrow. Bob, unless you want to see a terrible injustice done, you'll play for time. We must consider this thing carefully, I'll fix up a drink. - Good night Mr. Sheldon. - Good night Hazel, thank you. Bob, Bob... - What's the matter? - A man is been shot in the courtyard. What? Wait a minute sister, don't run away. - What happened? - A man is been shot. - You got a phone in there? - We already phoned for the ambulance. - Is he dead? - Yes. - Why, that's my secretary. - The girl he was with? Yes. Miss Normandie... - Oh Mr.Sheldon, Mr. Breeden is been shot. - Breeden? - You saw what happened? - Yes, she didn't do it. - You're sure? - Yes, I saw where the shot came from. - Then come down and tell the police. - Bob, I can't. You can't? But you saw it happen, didn't you? Yes but from your apartment. - What's that got to do with it? - Oh, Bob, think a minute. We agreed that until Father was cleared... while you were working to clear him nobody must know we're married. Yes. Bob, if anyone finds out that I've been in your apartment in the... middle of the night, the papers will trace our marriage just as sure as I stand here. But they may accuse Hazel of murder, you know she's innocent. She hasn't been accused yet. They're just questioning her. Probably a dozen other people saw the whole thing happen. No, I can't go down there Bob, I won't. I have you and Father to think of. - What do you know about this? - Oh, he was taking me home. I'd been working late, we were just starting for the car when the shot came. - Where did it come from? - Oh, I don't know. - Who did you say you worked for? - I didn't say. But I'm willing to tell you that I work for the State... Attorney General, he lives in this building. We're going up to see the Attorney General sister. - They're coming up. - Bob? You stay right here, I'll get rid of them. - Good evening Mr.Sheldon. - Good evening. - Sorry to bother. - Just a minute. Just a minute. Of course I know Miss Normandie and Mr. Breeden, they've worked with me for months. That's all I want to know, thanks Mr. Sheldon, come along. But I tell you, I didn't do anything. You'll have to go with them Hazel, it's only for a routine questioning. Oh, just a minute Mr. Sheldon. I'm Jack Daniels of The Tribune. Now what do you want? This Breeden, wasn't he the fella who uncovered the facts in the Vincent bribe case? - Yes, he was. - You think that's why they knocked him off? Who do you mean by they? Oh, anyone who wanted to slow up the investigation. - What do you think? - I'm sorry Mr. Daniels, I can't help you. - But... - Good night. Bob, what did he mean? I think the young man was trying to suggest... that your father hired an assassin to silence my investigator. - They wouldn't dare print a thing like that. - No but they'll hint at and that's worse. Because you can't fight back. The girl said she was here when the shot was fired. - But we picked her up over there. - Alright, then we'll measure the distance. Well... - Good morning Tom. - Good morning. Here's a gun the boys found, it's already been checked for prints. And here's the bullet taken from Breeden's body. - See if it came from that gun. - Alright. Bring that Normandie girl to my office right away. There it is. Now let me have the other. Hurry up, they want to see her inside right away. Alright, I'll be glad when she's off my hands. A wildcat that one is. - Now what? - Lieutenant wants you. - Oh well and I didn't know he cared. - Come on. There's no doubt the bullet that killed Breeden was fired from this gun. That's all I want to know, thanks Tom. Miss Normandie, just what were your relations with Mr. Breeden? My relations didn't like him, especially Uncle Charlie. That attitude isn't going to get you any place Miss Normandie. Oh, who wants to get any place? Just leave me alone. Alright, be comfortable. I can sit here just as long as you can. Oh, have a cigarette. Oh, I'm supposed look scared I guess, I bet you're a detective. Now cut that. We just got through matching the bullet... taken from Breeden's body with the rifle of this gun. That's the rod that knocked off your boyfriend. And it was purchased by Hazel Normandie at the Crown Hardware Store... - on July 7th of this year. - Well, I can explain that... Can you explain how this gun was found in the gutter not 20 feet from Breeden's body? I don't know how it happened to be there but I didn't do it. You can't deny it's your gun. - What are you on? - Normandie case. - And you? - Very confidential. What do they want from me? A graphic account of a bribe I never took? Let them draw up articles of impeachment, try me before the Senate, remove me from office. I can't say any more than I've said. Someone wants me out of office and wants it enough to frame me. All of us here are convinced of that Governor. And we're determined to uncover the plot and the people behind it. - Ah, it'll be a tough fight. - The opposition is out for blood. They got very little evidence to go on. Up to now but let me tell you gentlemen, If you were out there in that pool room where I am... you'd realize this investigation is no setup. They'd be equally suspicious of any office holder elected on the Governor's ticket. And I wonder. - Mr. Sheldon Miss Vincent on the wire. - Oh, thank you. Hello Ruth, they just leaving now. Well, not too reassuring. Your father seems very discouraged. You're going down to the Capitol too? Oh, you better not darling. Goodbye. To these of our Party men, Walter H. Vincent can do no harm. Unless the representatives observe the rules of parliamentary procedure... I shall be forced to call upon the sergeant at arms. I tender my apologies to the chair and to representative MacPherson. Throughout the course of our investigation of the acts... official and unofficial, admitted and concealed, of Walter H. Vincent... my learned colleague... representative Grosvenor, has given us a touching example of loyalty, party loyalty. The blind faith in his party, which he has demonstrated... in his efforts to hamper and clog this investigation... is shared by the Attorney General of this state. As I said before to these devout party men Walter Vincent can do no wrong. That's a deliberate and malicious untruth. Order order order. Very well then, I will ask one question. Has the Attorney General delayed bringing before this House... information discovered by an investigator in his own department? The Attorney General has laid before this House... all the evidence in the possession of his office. If that evidence seems slight, it's because Walter H. Vincent is an innocent man... answering flimsy and trumped up charges. Yes, the Attorney General has testified. But with what reluctance, what reticence. He came before this House not voluntarily, but because through the newspapers... this House had obtained knowledge of incriminating evidence in his possession. Gentlemen... is Sheldon a servant of the people or is he by any chance under personal... obligation to the man he seems so anxious to shield? I urge upon the investigating committee of this House... the prompt submission to the Sate's senate... of articles of impeachment against Walter H. Vincent. And I demand a relentless investigation into the activities of Attorney General Sheldon... and I shall at once introduce a bill to that effect. Yes, well, keep in touch with me. - Yes? - Miss Vincent is here. Send her in. I just come from the senate. - The floor is in an uproar. - Yes, I know, they just phoned me. They're after my hide now. All because you believed in Father and tried to help him. Up to now they think it's Party loyalty but if... becomes known you're married to me, they'll crucify you. Darling, we mustn't wait any longer, I just come back from the criminal court. Hazel Normandie is desperate, the district attorney flayed her on the witness stand. - You must go into court and clear that girl. - No, I won't let you throw your career away. My going on the stand telling the whole world that I'm your wife... would only bring Father and you crashing down together, no... I can't do it, we got to clear him first, then... Listen to me Ruth, Hazel's case goes to the jury this afternoon. - This afternoon? - Yes. Then I still have time. Holdstock Enterprises, hold a while sir. Mr. Kelly on the phone. - Yes? - Is Mr. Martin in? No Mr.Martin didn't come in today, he's home sick. - Where is he live? - Just a moment please. Martin, it's 102 North, Sheridan Drive miss, Apartment 39. Thank you. There has been much talk about motive. What motive had Hazel Normandie for the killing of Daniel Breeden? Ladies and gentlemen of the jury... frankly, I am in ignorance of this woman's motives. Perhaps it lies hidden in the sordid history of her illicit relations with Daniel Breeden. We have brought out the fact that this woman is already turned to at least one other man. Perhaps Breeden had to die to make way for his successor. But this I do know ladies and gentlemen... and every one of you holds these facts firmly in your mind... Hazel Normandie and Daniel Breeden were alone in an apartment courtyard late that night. A shot was fired at close range and Breeden fell dead. The following morning a pistol... sold to Hazel Normandie and registered at her name... was found at a spot not twenty feet from where Breeden fell. Questioned about this pistol, Hazel Normandie said only... I don't know how it got there. But you know ladies and gentlemen... it fell from the hand of Breeden's murderer. It fell from Hazel Normandie's hand. And acting upon this certain knowledge... you can do nothing but render a verdict of guilty. A human life is in your hands. In reaching your decision I know you will bear in mind the fact that no... possible motive has been shown prompting this young woman to... take the life of the man she has loved for three years. If Hazel Normandie sinned in loving Daniel Breeden, she has paid for her sin. She has gone through the ghastly experience of having her lover shot down at her feet. Shot down by an unknown assailant. You are twelve reasonable people. You are sensible of the awful gravity of the decision you'll have to make. You will not, you cannot take from this innocent woman the right to live. - Who is it? - Mr. Martin? - I said who is it? - This is Ruth Vincent. - I'd like to speak to you for a moment. - You alone? Yes. Mr. Martin, I've come to ask you for your help. I can't help you. Yes, you can. You were Holdstock's secretary. Why don't you go to his attorney if there's anything... - Please, there's no need to be upset. - Why must I be hounded by everybody? Everybody wants to know this and that, forgive me. I'm not well. - Maybe I can help you. - What do you want? Who forced Holdstock to put the ten thousand dollars in the bank? I told all I knew the first day I was questioned. Mr. Martin, it is generally believed that Holdstock committed suicide. Has it ever occurred to you he might've been murdered? - He was murdered. - Who did it? - I'm willing to tell the Attorney General. - I'll take you to him. Mr. Martin has something to tell you. - Mr. Martin, sit down. - No. - I've been wanting to tell all the time. - And why haven't you told? I'm afraid, I'm afraid. Afraid. Get some water. Get Dr. Connelly quick, the man must've been under some terrific strain. Ruth, you must go over the Court before the jury goes out. No, in a few minutes I'll have Martin's story and then I'll go. Dr. Connelly, just a moment. Mr. Sheldon calling. - Dr. Connelly, can you come right over? - He's gone. Down the fire escape. Union Station quick. He's tricked us. That man knows the answer to everything we're trying to find out. We got to get him. Get me the Chief of Police, Attorney General speaking. Chief, I want you to pick up a man for me, named Willis Martin. That's right, Willis Martin. A general radio broadcast is about the only chance you got. Right, about 5' 6, sandy hair, about fifty. Brown suit and hat. I know, but you'll have to do the best you can. - Where is courtroom 8 please? - Right there. Thank you. - Is it all over? - No, the jury is still out. Where can we find Hazel Normandie's attorney? Room 83, it's on this floor just down to your left. Thank you. Well ladies and gentlemen, I think we're agreed sufficiently to take a ballot. If you wish to vote for acquittal, drop in the white ball. If your vote is for guilty, drop in the black one. Now, everybody understand that alright? White for acquittal, black for guilty. It's a great pity Mr. Sheldon, that you couldn't get here before. I'll find Judge Halloway, this evidence is most vital and I'm sure he'll consider it. Eight, nine, ten... eleven, twelve. Well, it looks as if we were all agreed. - Your Honor, the jury has reached a verdict. - Oh, thank you Carter. Your Honor, the defense attorney wants to speak to you immediately. Tell him I can't talk to him now. Everybody rise. This honorable court is now in session. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, have you reached a verdict? - We have, Your Honor. - May it please the Court. I have new and startling evidence to place before the jury. I move that this case be reopened for further evidence. The attorney for the defense is aware that the jury stand ready to render their verdict. What's the nature of this evidence? Is it of sufficient importance to justify its introduction in this highly irregular manner? It's the testimony of an eyewitness to the crime Your Honor. Testimony which will completely exonerate my client. The defendant is motion is granted, let\ the witness come forward and be sworn. Raise your right hand please. You do solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give in this case... to be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help you God? - Jury back in yet? - Yeah. - What's the betting on the verdict? - Ah, that dame is guilty alright. Hey, looks like they're taking new evidence. Will you tell the Court in your own words exactly what you know regarding the... circumstances connected with the murder of Daniel Breeden. I will. Where were you at the instant when the crime... with which my client is charged was committed? I was in my husband's apartment Robert Sheldon's apartment. 2620, Walnut Avenue. Give me the City desk. Here he comes now. Surely you could've told me you were married. Oh, Dad, we didn't want you to hear it like this. We wanted to come and tell you right away. But then Bob had this evidence against you and he wanted to clear you first. I understand. And of course yesterday I had to come forward. I had to save that girl's life no matter what happened. It was the only thing to do. I'm afraid your Bob and I will both lose our jobs. - It's so terribly unjust. - It certainly is. I hate to see you go through all this old man. More grueling questioning, you're in no shape to stand it. - How can I avoid it? - Resign. Before the impeachment trial gets under way. It's not like you Jim, to counsel quitting under fire. I'm thinking of the state and of the Party. Well I'm not, I'm thinking of myself. I'm accused of selling pardons to criminals. And of selling my daughter to Bob Sheldon to keep him quiet. If I quit fighting now, I deserve nothing better than contempt from party and state. Stubborn old war horse, aren't you? Attorney General's office, yes. - For the Attorney General, personal. - Come right in please. - Good morning sir. - Good morning. Thank you. What is it, Bob? A copy of the resolution House passed yesterday demanding my resignation. Poor Dad, now the senate gets the chance to tear him to pieces. As if the investigating committee hadn't done enough. Oh Bob, I've been a jinx to you. - I've smashed your career. - It isn't smashed yet. They can demand my resignation till they run out of words. But I'm not going to supply it without a battle. At the impeachment trial I suppose they'll question you... even more closely regarding Holdstock's private papers. - Will you have to produce that letter? - Yes, there's no way around it. - Yes? - Sergeant Burke wants to see you sir. - Alright, I'll come out and see him. - Excuse me. - Good morning Mr. Sheldon. - What is it Burke? Bring him in. We picked him up crossing the State line sir. Burke, I don't want to resort to any rough stuff... but you and I are going to see that this man talks. He knows something about John Holdstock that may clear Governor Vincent. And we're going to find out what it is. Do you think my telling you that will help Governor Vincent? Of course it will. - I'm afraid. - Why? Because of this. Anonymous. Who be likely to send you a threat like that? Representative MacPherson to see you Mr. Sheldon. Mr. Attorney General... I hand you herewith a subpoena calling for the immediate presence of Mr Willis Martin... before the investigating committee of the House of Representatives. Mr. MacPherson, I'll surrender Mr. Willis Martin when I've finished questioning him. May I ask for evidence of your legal right to detain this man? Have you a writ, warrant or subpoena? Did you pick up Martin on a bench warrant Burke? No sir. On the chief's orders. - You may have the witness Mr.MacPherson. - Mr Martin, you'll accompany these officers. Mrs. Sheldon, I've a subpoena for you too as an eyewitness to the shooting of Breeden. Very well, I'll be there when I'm called. If MacPherson thinks that Martin is going to be a star witness... for the prosecution this afternoon, I think we'll be able to disappoint him. Representative MacPherson, you may proceed with your questioning. This committee, appointed by the House of Representatives... calls as it's next witness, Willis H. Martin. Mr. Martin, you for many years, both before and after, his... imprisonment were secretary to the late John F. Holdstock. I was. You deposited the money, 10,000 dollars in currency to the account of Walter H. Vincent. Yes sir. The Attorney General questioned you with regard to this transaction? He did sir. Did the Attorney General ask you to withhold this information from anyone? No sir, he did not. Did he in your hearing ever express his intention of keeping this information secret? Well, not exactly sir. I did see him take that letter from the private files. What letter? A letter written to Mr. Holdstock by Governor Vincent. That's all, unless counsel for Governor Vincent has some question. No, no questions now. I call as my next witness Mr. Robert Sheldon. Call Mr. Robert Sheldon. Mr. Robert Sheldon. Excuse me. Mr. Sheldon. The witness Willis Martin has referred to a certain letter taken... by you from the private files of the late John Holdstock. - Can you produce this letter? - Yes. I ask the chair to instruct the clerk... to read this letter into the records of this committee. Clerk will read the letter. My dear friend Holdstock... You know of course that the expense of maintaining my stock farm... has exceeded the income during the year. In view of past favors I feel sure that you will understand me... when I remind you that the time for the matter we discussed has come. Signed W.H.V. He made me put that letter in the file so the Attorney General would find it. - He got me into this. - Try to calm yourself. He kept telling me that, be calm, be calm and I'll see you through. It was all his doing from the start. Breeden, Breeden, Breeden/. - Breeden, that's why I killed him. - Breeden? Working for me all these months and I trusted him completely. - You said Breeden forced you to do this? - Just a moment Martin is still my witness. - When did you first meet Breeden? - Shortly after Holdstock's pardon. I saw Breeden for the first time, quite accidentally, as I thought. After that, every day I'd go out for lunch I'd meet Breeden. It seemed something more than coincidence. Nights when I'd leave the office, he'd be waiting outside. He found out that I had no money, that I'd lost my life's savings in Holdstock's crash. Then he began telling me that he had inside information... that Holdstock had saved plenty out of his failure. That Holdstock could pay me back if he wanted to. He kept hammering at me, hammering at me. Finally, one morning... when I had to take Holdstock's mail to his house Breeden went with me. If you come out without what's due you, you're not the man I think you are. - He'll swear he hasn't a cent. - I told you what to do then. - But I... - He'll give and give quickly. Go on in. I'll be waiting out here. Oh, good morning Willis. How are you this morning? Come in, had your breakfast yet? I had to do everything for myself this morning, my valet is in the hospital. As you know, I can't afford a second man. You can't afford? You're holding out, that's what you're doing. Willis, what's the matter with you? You know I'm cleaned out. I'll never cease to regret carrying you down in my crash. You and hundreds like you. You got plenty tucked away, you're making plenty right now. Willis, what are you talking about? - This doesn't sound like you. - No. Not like the old Willis Martin, the poor sap. Good little man who asked no questions. You're dealing with somebody who's on to you now John Holdstock. I want my money, I want it now. - Well, this I tell you... - I want my money. - Don't be a fool, put that gun down. - Give me my money. Your money is gone, I have nothing. You killed him, you fool. - Anybody around? - No, he was all alone. Now don't you worry, you do just as I tell you and you be safe as a church. You stay here, I'll fix everything and I'll take care of you. Maybe he's not dead. Call an ambulance. I got our man. Do you have the money ready? I'll be at your house in a half an hour. It's all fixed, it'll look like suicide. Come on with me. That's how... That's how I was forced to deposit that money, he gave it to me. He gave me that letter to plant in the private files. To whom did Breeden talk over the phone? Who supplied this money Breeden told you to deposit? The man who framed the Governor, Jim Lansdale. - Clearly insane. - I can prove every word I've said. The Governor's best friend. - Gentlemen gentlemen please. - You don't believe me, listen... That night, after I'd killed Holdstock, I was alone in the office. Breeden came back. I was nearly crazy, he told me to come along with him. He took me to his house. - What you need is a good drink. - Pretty nice place. You ought to see the other one I have in the country. Very nice. That's because I chose a good friend. Jim Lansdale never lets a man down if he's been loyal to him. You're working for Lansdale. And you're in the Attorney General's office. Oh yes, why not? Two jobs are better than one. Well, here's luck. This makes ten since noon unless I've lost count. Will you have a cigar? I got a lighter here somewhere, a man's pocket gets so laden down with junk. Yes sir Martin. You couldn't pick a better man than Jim Lansdale for a friend. He'll treat you right unless you're a fool like Vincent. You know what he did? Vetoed the highway bill when Lansdale, a man who made him... governor, stood to make a million by it, can you imagine that? What a fool that Vincent was. From that time on Lansdale was out to get him. Well, I turned that trick, you and me together, Willis. It was child's play for Lansdale to use a typewriter in the Governor's home. He had the run of the house. It was simple, everything was simple. By the way, it was darn nice of you to bump off Holdstock for me. For a while I didn't think you'd have the nerve. Well, drink up, I've got a date with my honey. Now come on, come on. You know the rest. I'd heard him say he'd meet his girl in front of Sheldon's apartment. I followed him there and killed him. I killed him and I'm glad I killed him because he made me a murderer. Mister Chairman... I move that this committee shall recommend to the House of Representatives... that all charges imparted in the articles of impeachment of Governor Vincent... be dropped forthwith. Gentlemen, you've heard the motion, all those in favor will signify by saying aye. Aye. Contrary, no. The ayes have it. Gentlemen this committee is adjourned sine die. Congratulations. Congratulations Governor. Governor, you... - What's happened? - Lansdale shot himself. - And let's hope he didn't miss. - Why did he do it? Lansdale was behind the whole frame up. - Lansdale? - He'd been paying Breeden. Breeden used Martin to carry out the frame up. Martin killed him. Your father is entirely vindicated as we knew he'd be. Dad. - And to think that Jim Lansdale... - Oh Dad, don't worry any more. The nightmare is over. Please say you're glad we're married. - Take care of her, Bob. - You bet.
