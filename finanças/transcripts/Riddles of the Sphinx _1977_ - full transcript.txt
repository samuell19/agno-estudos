When we were planning the central section of this film, about a mother and child, we decided to use the voice of the Sphinx as an imaginary narrator- because the Sphinx represents, not the voice of truth, not an answering voice, but its opposite: a questioning voice, a voice asking a riddle. The Oedipus myth associates the voice of the Sphinx with motherhood as mystery and with resistance to patriarchy. In some ways the Sphinx is the forgotten character in the story of Oedipus. Everybody knows that Oedipus killed his father and married his mother, but the part played by the Sphinx is often overlooked. Oedipus set off for Thebes, turning away from Corinth, where he'd been brought up by foster parents. The Sphinx sat perched on a cliff or pillar outside the city gates; she asked every man who went past a riddle. If they couldn't answer, she devoured them. Then she stopped Oedipus when he went past and when he answered her correctly, she threw herself down from the pillar and killed herself. The myth of the Sphinx took on new life after Napoleon's campaigns in Egypt when the Great Sphinx at Giza was disclosed once again to Western eyes. The Egyptian Sphinx is male, but on its blank face, resonant with mystery and with death, the spectator could project the image of the Greek Sphinx. Once again the Sphinx could enter popular mythology, in the image of male fears and male fantasies, the cannibalistic mother, part bestial, part angelic, indecipherable. Oedipus is different from other Greek heroes in that he defeated the monster, not by strength or by bravery, but simply by intelligence. In his answer to the riddle, Oedipus restored the generations to their proper order, but by doing so he fell into a further trap. In his own life he disordered them once more by marrying his own mother. It's almost as if Oedipus stands for the conscious mind and the Sphinx for the unconscious. The riddle confuses and disorders logical categories and the monster is a hybrid of human, animal and bird. But reading between the lines the myth confirms women's sense of exclusion and suppression. The Sphinx is outside the city gates, she challenges the culture of the city, with its order of kinship and its order of knowledge, a culture and a political system which assign women a subordinate place. To the patriarchy, the Sphinx as woman is a threat and a riddle, but women within patriarchy are faced with a never-ending series of threats and riddles - dilemmas which are hard for women to solve, because the culture within which they must think is not theirs. We live in a society ruled by the father, in which the place of the mother is suppressed. Motherhood and how to live it, or not to live it, lies at the roots of the dilemma. And meanwhile, the Sphinx can only speak with a voice apart, a voice off. Time to get ready. Time to come in. Things to forget. Things to lose. Meal time. Story time. Desultory. Peremptory.

I minded more than I could ever have dared. Mind the door. Mind the glass. Mind the fire. Mind the child. I never minded the warmth. I minded the need. "It was needed to have minded," I used to say, but was it needed to have minded more than very much? More than I could ever have dared? Transformed, I would confide. I could have cried.

Look. You've got my number haven't you, at Keith's? Just ring me if there's anything. All right? Bye, Anna. - Oh, hello! - Hello. - Anna. - Hello, Anna. Are you going shopping with that? Will you take me to the shop? - The shop? - We can buys some things at the shop. Can we play outside? I don't want to be in here. We could go outside? What shall we measure? What shall we measure? Whoops! Let's see which one's heaviest. You want to get into the shop? All right then. What are you going to sell me? Bye bye, my love. I've got to go now. I've got to go to work. I'll see you later, I'll collect you after tea. Bye. Bye my love. Say goodbye. Don't worry. We'll look after her. Number, please? - Hello, Mrs Smith... - ...extension 510. Extension 203... - Hello, who's calling? - Number, please? I'll put you through to extension number... Extension 506 is still unavailable. I'm afraid the number is engaged. Will you wait? Extension 8... Would you just like to hold the line, I'll try and find out what extension it is? Ah, Maxine, good. Ls Anna all right? Oh, that's a relief. I knew she'd be all right with you once I'd gone. That's why I'm ringing. I don't think I'm going to be able to. No, it's not that really, it's just I can't talk now, I'll tell you when I come and collect Anna. We'll arrange something else perhaps. Listen, I must go now, OK? Bye. I'm sorry. Did I cut you off? Can I reconnect you? What number was it you wanted? 498... I'm very sorry. Fernbrook Products... Extension 222 is engaged, will you hold? You could do with a cup of tea now. We really have to think about it. Oh, definitely. You do have to think about it. I mean, it costs a lot of money doesn't it? What happened to you then? Well, you know I have to take my Ellie to the child minder's. Well, this morning she was ill and she couldn't cope, so I had to go right across the other side of London. The child minder's got a friend, you know, and she helped her out. But I mean, I had to go right down Holloway Road and it cost me twice as much as usual. They ought to have a nursery here, the company ought to provide one. Well they should really. I mean, it would make my life a bit easier if they did. I'm not sure. I don't really like the idea of my kids here where I work... Louise, put the milk in that tea then. ...I like to think of work as being a bit separate from the house. Well, they're rich enough, aren't they'? Yeah, I know, but it's such an effort, isn't it? It's just a job isn't it? Look how many mothers there are here. They've all got young children. They've all got problems about leaving them. I know I have. I hate leaving mine, - I can't keep my mind on my work. - But you are the worrying type. Well, it's not that, is it? If you've got to take your child to the nursery before you get to work, no wonder you're in a flap when you get here. What was all that about then? Something about nurseries, I think. Oh. What, is she worried about her kid? Yeah, she doesn't like leaving her you know. Coming in, leaving her somewhere else. She's only been here a little while, but she's talking about lots of problems. She's rig ht though. - We ought to have a nursery here. - Yeah. We've got a Personnel Manager, give him something to do. Oh, yeah, they'll probably only take it off the wages anyway. Oh, no, not if the Union's involved. Somebody ought to find out what they could do about it really. I think Louise should. I mean, it was her idea in the first place. Yeah, I suppose it depends how many people there are who've got kids and need this. Yeah, I think the important thing to do is to find out how many kids are involved and the ages as well, and then take it to the Union and see if they can do anything about it with the management. He should be here by now. A little boy with fair hair. I think he's got to come across the footbridge. What were you asking about your little girl? Well, at the moment, she's in a community nursery, where Maxine works, but I was wondering whether it wouldn't be better to have the nursery at work. Have the Unions thought about that? Not much really. You're lucky to get any sort of day care, let alone the one that suits you best. Hello. Give this to your mother and say thanks for waiting. Bye! Local authorities are cutting back on nursery education aren't they'? Yes that's right. It may stimulate the women to demand more for themselves though. Have the Unions ever done anything at all about day care? They haven't done very much. The TUC is in favour of free state nursery care for any parent who wants it, but we're a long way from that. I was wondering whether... There are some nurseries in the textile industry and the Unions do negotiate about child care there, but that's an industry that really depends on women's labour. Unless there's organised action around it, the Union wouldn't have any reason to take it up, it's like most things. We have to do something first if we want the Unions to take it up. How can you make people see the connection between better wages and providing day care? Well, trade unionism isn't just a question of wages struggle. It's about work conditions too, it has to be. In that case, might the Unions get involved in running nurseries? They might. All sons of questions come up with workplace nurseries. Should the mothers be allowed to visit during the day? Should the creche stay open to let women shop before they collect their children? Some Unions want the employers to pay for company nurseries, but have the nurseries run by Unions and parents together. Questions arose which seemed to form a linked ring, each raising the next until they led the argument back to its original point of departure. Should women demand special working conditions for mothers? Can a child-care campaign attack anything fundamental to women's oppression? Should women's struggle be concentrated on economic issues? Is domestic labour productive? Is the division of labour the root of the problem? Is exploitation outside the home better than oppression within it? Should women organise themselves separately from men? Could there be a social revolution in which women do not play the leading role? How does women's struggle relate to class struggle? Is patriarchy the main enemy for women'? Does the oppression of women work on the unconscious as well as on the conscious'? What would the politics of the unconscious be like? How necessary is being-a-mother to women, in reality or imagination? Is the family an obstacle to the liberation of women? Is the family needed to maintain sexual difference? What other forms of childcare might there be'? Are campaigns about childcare a priority for women now'? Question after question arose, revolving in her mind without reaching any clear conclusion They led both out into society and back into her own memory. Future and past seemed to be locked together. She felt a gathering of strength but no certainty of success. Let's go and have a nice time in the garden. Oh, look they're looking at photos. You go and have a look at those while I go and see to the bonfire Now this one. Ooh, that's a lovely drink too. Here are the tomatoes. This will make them all lovely and red. We don't want green tomatoes, do we? No, we want lovely red ones... Some are here, look. There you are. That's it. Ooh, look at those. What are they up to? Quick! Quick! OK, put that in there for Grandma. That's right. And there's a stick. Put the stick in. That's right. - There's a stick. - Shall we blow it'? Blow it! That's right. There we are... There we are, all lovely and blazing. No, no. Come on now, I want you to help me. Put more paper on because that makes a lovely blaze. Oooh! That's better. That's better! Yes. _ Bye bye. _ Bye bye. BYE bye. Do you mind, I've just got to get this film ready. Won't be a moment, OK? - OK. - Right. Hey, Louise, I've got something to show you. Have you got a mirror? Here. - See? - Mm-hm. - Look. - What? It should be in mirror writing. - It is. - OK. Now, look. Oh! It's not in mirror writing. - How does it work? - Magic. No, seriously, it's the cellophane. It acts as a special kind of filter. It puts the letters back to front again so they appear the right way round. Do you know, I think camels are my favourite animals. I like the way that camel's much bigger than that pyramid. And the way the desert just stretches out to the horizon. I think it's their shape, all lumpy and baggy, hanging over a ramshackle old skeleton. OK, I think I'm ready. Shall we start? Oh, Chris, by the way, there's something I wanted to say to you. I've decided... I want to sell the house. Oh. Erm... Umm... OK, if that's what you want. What about the market though? It's a bad time to sell, isn't it? It's a good time for me to sell. - I've decided I want to be rid of it. - All right. You won't get much money for anywhere else, you know, once we've sold the mortgage. I don't think I want anywhere else. I'm going to be staying with Maxine. She'll be much nearer and you'll be able to see Anna more. Yes, Anna's older. She doesn't need me all the time now. You mean you don't need her? Well anyway that's what we've decided, haven't we? Right. Shall we start? Is it work by a woman artist? Yes that's right. It's about her child and herself as the mother. I've got some film, I've got some video tape as well. I'll put the lights out. Mary Kelly, retaping. The diaries in this document are based on recorded conversations between mother and child, that is myself and my son, at the crucial moment of his entry into nursery school. The conversations took place at weekly intervals between September 7th and November 26th 1975. They came to a natural end with his/my adjustment to school. There also occurs at this moment a kind of 'splitting' of the dyadic mother/child unit which is evident in my references, in the diaries, to the father's presence and in my son's use of pronouns, significantly in his conversations and of implied diagrams for example, concentring markings and circles in his drawings. The marking process is regulated by the nursery routine, so that almost daily finished 'works' are presented by the children to their mothers. Consequently, these markings become the logical terrain on which to map out the 'signification' of the maternal discourse. September 27th. I was shocked to find that he was crying when I picked him up from the nursery. I didn't think about coming early and he saw the others leave. Now he's very suspicious when I take him. I can't forgive myself for that because I should have known. Although, I thought that, I was so convinced that he was different, that he is very sociable. The second day he actually screamed when I left. The teachers made me leave. I was shocked because Ray was not upset by it at all although I couldn't take him again that week. I had Sally take him the first three days and Ray took him the rest of the week. I suppose it's kind of lack of boundary definition. October 11th. I was distressed all this week by his apparent anxiety over going back to the nursery and I felt a bit guilty about being away teaching every day until Wednesday. And he had tantrums which freaked Sally out. Thursday was the first day that I saw him and it bothered me as well Roll 34, Take 1. October 24th. I was amazed that he actually said I like school this week. At least that's sorted out but why doesn't he get over this tonsillitis. He had to go to the doctor again this week. It was a very unsatisfactory check-up, it took about one minute. It just makes me feel more responsible for him when other people don't show concern for him. But I guess I'm just as bad, I forgot to give him his medicine. Weaning from the dyad. For both the mother and the child, the crucial moment of "weaning" is constituted by the intervention of a "third term", that is, the father, thus consolidating the oedipal triad and undermining the Imaginary dyad which determined the inter-subjectivity of the pre-oedipal instance. This intervention situates the imaginary 'third term' of the primordial triangle, that is, the child as phallus, and the paternal imago of the mirror phase within the dominance of the symbolic structure through the word of the father. That is, the mother's words referring to the authority of the 'father' to which the real father may or may not conform. What does it mean? I can't understand most of it. Oh... they're thoughts. Pieces of thoughts... I put into words, and... pieces of words... which seemed to mean something and I wanted to remember. What about this? What does this mean? "They make a groove or a pattern into which or upon which other patterns fit or are placed unfitted and are cut by circumstance to fit." I don't know. It must be something I copied out of a book. I see what it is. She felt she had been living in a fairy tale, the oldest fairy tale that we still know, from the Valley of the Nile. It matched with something she remembered very clearly from her childhood. Yes. Now I remember now. It's about how she went out with her mother and her little brother and how her mother laughed at them when they said they weren't going home. Her mother just turned and went round the corner. Do you know, I remember almost the same thing. I remember sitting on the kerb and refusing to move. There must have been something I wanted and my mother wouldn't give it to me, and a little group of people gathered round. It's like when you go to a demonstration. There's a ring of people standing looking at you and you don't know whose side they're on. You feel very defiant and eventful. What about this? When was this? I was on a boat, sitting on a stool in front of the mast, eating a pear which had been out very carefully into slices. It was a large boat, some kind of naval vessel, because it had large guns and sailors wearing helmets with plumes. They must have been soldiers, a whole regiment of them. I was afraid of the soldiers. It seemed to me that they were finding fault with me. I think it was because they wanted to weigh anchor. So I went down to my cabin and looked at myself in the looking glass. Only instead of myself, I saw my father carrying a saucepan. He said he had come for the wool-combing. There was going to be some kind of festival where the sheep were going to be sheared and the wool combed by women. The sheep were held down by straps. Then my father blew on a bugle and the soldiers with plumes on their helmets all came in. My father ordered me to begin combing the wool. I said, "I can't, I'm dead beat." He said that I must, or I would infect everybody at the festival with some kind of disease, or rather, all the men at the festival. They all began to show horrible symptoms. They were growing gills and their entrails were falling out. I was very frightened, and picked up the comb which had a number of notches cut in it. My father began to coax me to begin combing but I was not able to. Then I noticed that standing behind my father was another man, who seemed to be lame, or perhaps some kind of priest. He asked me whether I was an oyster woman. Everybody was excited by this question, which they seemed to think was very shrewd, but I did not know what to reply. I ran to my father and seized the saucepan which he had been holding in his hands. It was full of jewels, which had a rind on them. When I began to shell them, all the men began to grind their teeth but I carried on peeling the rind. Inside there were hundreds of tiny caraway seeds. When I looked up, I saw that the lame man was wearing a feathered headdress, like an Indian Chief, I suddenly realised that all this time, I had been wearing a veil. I tore it off and threw the caraway seeds at the lame man, dressed like an Indian Chief. He became all distorted and disappeared. Only my father was left. I felt very perplexed. Then he said, "You must receive communion at Easter." I realised that it was Ash Wednesday and I thought that I must be my mother, although I knew she was dead. I had a feeling of jubilation and in a very loud voice I ordered that all my father's property should be sold by auction. All the women threw away their combs and shouted... "Bravo! Well done!" They unstrapped all the sheep and knocked the helmets and the military caps off the soldiers. I don't remember much more except that I was dancing on the deck of the ship in front of a sheet of canvas or sailcloth. There were colours and banners. When I looked at the sea, it seemed to be made of silk. What does that mean, I wonder? I don't knew exactly. That's why I wrote it. I hoped that I'd understand it more. I guess it has the texture of meaning. She remembered reading somewhere a passage from a book which she could no longer trace, words which had struck her at the time and which she now tried to reconstruct. Inscribed on the lid of the box were the words "Anatomy is No Longer Destiny" and inside, when she opened it, she found the figure of the Greek Sphinx with full breasts and feathery wings. She lifted it up out of the box to look at it more closely. As she did so, it seemed to her that its lips moved and it spoke a few phrases in a language which she could not understand, except for three words which were repeated several times: Capital, Delay and Body. She replaced it in the box and closed the lid. She could feel her heart beat. The rhythm of the sentences was not quite right and she felt sure there was some particular she had forgotten. She tried to imagine the scene as the writer might have. Would the box have been padded with cushioning, a quilted material, folds of velvet, black or red, buttoned or embroidered? What would the pattern of the embroidery be? She imagined an intricate web of curved forms, intertwined knots, like the tendrils and fronds in the marsh where, according to Bachofen... the first matriarchy arose, or the curls of pubic hair from which, according to Freud, women wove the first veil. What kind of material was the Sphinx carved from? Soft like wax or hard like agate? Ancient like amber or modern like bakelite'? Were the feathers real, rippling under her heedful touch like overlapping waves? Whatever it was that she'd forgotten, it was surely more something central, more weighty, not some detail of design or manufacture. Could she have known the name of the language which the Sphinx spoke? The more she tried to remember, the more she found her mind wandering, mislaying the thread of logical reconstruction and returning to images from her own childhood. She remembered how, when she had been very small, her mother had lifted her up to carry heron her hip and how she had hovered round her cot while she fell asleep. She remembered her feeling of triumph when her father left the house and the sudden presentiment of separation which followed. There was the time when she had opened a drawer with a little key and found a piece of coral and a badge which had gone darkish green. And she remembered one morning coming into her mother's room and finding her mother's friend sleeping next to her mother, and she suddenly understood something she realised her mother had tried to explain and she felt a surge of panic, as though she'd been left behind and lost. She thought her mother would be angry, but she smiled, and, when she got out of bed, she noticed the shapes of the arch of her foot and her heel and the back of her calf. She had been drawing acrobats, trajectories of the body and displays of skill and balance. She saw them no longer as pioneers of the ideal, but as bodies at work, expending their labour power upon its own material. She was fascinated by the gap between the feeling of bodily exertion and the task of drawing and writing, gestures which consumed themselves in their own product, giving a false sense of effortlessness which no acrobat could hope to approach. Capital, Delay and Body. She replaced it in the box and closed the lid. She could feel her heart beat. She felt giddy with success, as though after labouring daily to prevent a relapse into her pristine humanity, she had finally got what she wanted. She shuddered. Suddenly she heard a voice, very quiet, coming from the box, the voice of the Sphinx, growing louder, until she could hear it clearly, compellingly, and she knew that it had never ever been entirely silent and that she had heard it before, all her life, since she first understood that she was a girl. The voice was so familiar yet so fatally easy to forget. She smiled and, in her mind, she flung herself through the air. ...into a social hieroglyphic. Later on, we try to decipher the hieroglyphic to get behind the secret... To the patriarchy, the Sphinx, as woman, is a riddle and a threat. But to women, who live under patriarchy... To the patriarchy, the Sphinx as woman is a riddle and a threat. But women within patriarchy are faced by a never-ending series of threats and riddles - dilemmas which are hard for women to solve, because the culture within which they must think is not theirs. We live in a society ruled by the father, in which the place of the mother is suppressed. Motherhood and how to live it, or not to live it, lies at the roots of the dilemma. And meanwhile, the voice of the Sphinx is a voice apart, a voice off. I was looking at an island in the glass. It was an island of comfort in a sea of blood. It was lonely on the island. I held tight. It was night and, in the night, I felt the past. Each drop was red. Blood flows thicker than milk, doesn't it? Blood shows on silk, doesn't it? It goes quicker. Spilt. No use trying. No use replying. Spilt. It goes stickier. The wind blew along the surface of the sea. It bled and bled. The island was an echo of the past. It was an island of comfort, which faded as it glinted in the glass.
