There is a hole below the airplane. -A hole? -Yes. They keep doing it, up there, and it keeps dropping on the surface. They keep doing it, up there, and it keeps dropping on surface? I hope you aren't lying. I am not a minister that I would lie. It's not like that. They keep doing it, up there, and it keeps dropping down. First, the airplane spoiled my mood and now you are ruining it. Forget it. Give me water. I need to wash my hands. -Give it to me. -The water spilled. Use a stone or something. You can never take care of anything. It wasn't a gem or jewelry. You never do anything right. You are always like this. -Sir, we were just.. -The MLA is here. -Move aside. -Please, sir.

Say it again! -Why did you kill her? The MLA Harjeet Singh Mann's son Garry Mann got into a fight at the place where his daughter's dead body was found. Come, let's meet that innocent man whose love was crushed because of pride and ego. Yes, sir. He killed my Simran. He killed Simran. Garry killed his sister. Because he is an MLA's son and I belong to a middle-class family. He couldn't tolerate our love. Let me tell you something! He will kill me just the way he killed his sister. And all of you will just watch him do that. How dare he revile me? What have I done? Shall I tell you what you have done, you fool? You ruined my reputation, you idiot! What have I done?

Stop acting childish. Open the door. I am an idler, right? What do you want from me now? Should I open up an office? Should I become an advocate and plead before people? I never said that you're an idler. Why are you being angry with me? It's just that your marriage proposal was rejected. It's okay. -Open the door. -Leave me alone, Dad. Go away. My dear... Judge! Listen.. Listen to me, my child. You are back? My 15th marriage proposal was accepted. Do you want me to celebrate the fact that this was just my 7th? Go away from here! Are you sure, my dear? Dad? Dad! -Sir! -Dad! Sir! -Sir! -Dad! Finally, I caught it. I had been chasing it for a while. You were catching a rat? I came running wondering what happened to my father. And you... Dad, you know that every boy of my age is married. You know that, don't you? There are just two boys left, Gora and me. If Gora gets married before then... No, my dear. Don't talk nonsense. Calm down and think about this. Think about where you stand before Gora. There is no comparison. He won't get married before you. Judge! Judge! Hurry up. Hurry up. -Yes, Gora.

You wasted 15 minutes by coming late. If they reach before us, they will reject the proposal. Uncle, how many times have I told you not to worry? I am here to take care of everything. Why shouldn't we worry? Girls have started addressing me as uncle. That's what girls do. To hide their own age, they address men as uncle. They even address me as uncle. You're not even of his age! Stop your nonsense. Get this straight. If things don't work out today, then we will find another matrimonial agent. Yes. Judge! My brother. Why are you getting angry? Do I have any other option? This time it will be done. This time I will get your marriage fixed. -I guarantee it. -Look who's talking! -Today, let me put you through the test. -Uncle, I assure you. It will be done. Wow!

Call them up. I will call them up. You are strange. -Dad. -Yes? -Mr. Amrik Singh? -Isn't it good? -You look so handsome. -It's amazing, isn't it? You look just like me. This is exactly how I looked when I was of your age. They are here. Hurry up. Call me once you reach here. -Hello. -Hi. -I seek your blessings. -Hello... It's not them. Yes? Where have you reached? At the crossroad? Come soon. They are here. You should have told us before. Normally, you utter nonsense. -Go and get them. -Don't irritate me! -I am the one who invited them. -He is such a weirdo. The father is more eager than the son. He has driven me crazy. Dad, I think they are here. You shouldn't seek blessings of every person you come across. -You shouldn't be so eager, son. -I will be there. On time. Okay. Bye. -Hello. -This photo is also nice. Uncle. He is Mr. Amrik Singh. And he is Mr. Lakhbir Singh. That's his son Judge. -Hello. -Hi. -I seek your blessings. -God bless you. -Hello. How are you? -How are you? Fine. -Manga, why didn't you tell me? -Dear! Come here. You could have told us beforehand that it was him. -Hello. -Hello. -Hello. -She's Kuljit. And she is her mother. -I seek your blessings. -Be happy. God bless you. -Lord Almighty. -Lord Almighty. -Lord Almighty. -Lord Almighty. One hundred rupees! He's putting 100 rupees! -Lord Almighty. -I have only 10 rupees. One thousand rupees... I'll offer it. He didn't even see it. Never mind. Lord Almighty. Yes. It's the same guy I was talking about. His name is Judge. But he doesn't even look like a driver. Keep quiet. He is so handsome. Judge, how did you like the girl? I asked, how did you like the girl? I will wrap this up quickly. She is very beautiful, Father. I suggest to take her home, today itself. You can ask him, if there's something you want to know. Manga has told us everything, already. You come from a nice family. The boy has done an LLB. But my dear, what do you do? You just said it yourself. I am a law graduate. Being a law graduate is fine. But what work do you do? -Look, Mr. Amrik Singh... -Yes? Tell me, if the boy is a law graduate, then what will he be? -An advocate? -That's right! He is a very famous advocate. He is well reputed and known as murder specialist. A murder specialist. People queue in front of his chamber with cases. What kind of questions are you asking? This becomes embarrassing. They will think that I didn't tell you anything. No. This is not what I meant, Manga. -Don't be angry. -Come on. I just wanted a reassurance. You too can ask if you have any questions for my daughter. No. Everything is fine. Children from decent family can be recognized from a distance. Sir. -Your marriage is fixed? -Yes. Then what gift will you give me? You? I will buy you a phone. A phone? Really? We made a huge mistake today. We shouldn't have consented to Manga's lie. Dad, you know nothing. The marriage got fixed, didn't it? Forget about it now. Besides, your times were different. This isn't considered a lie these days. Look my dear, we've never done anything wrong. I didn't bring you up with such values. -Dad, this... -Answer a question of mine. How many forests are there in this world? How many elephants are there in them? Millions, right? My dear, an elephant eats food weighing one quintal in a day. Do you provide food to them? Or do I? The God, who provides nourishment to a parasite inside a stone, shall also fulfill our needs. But we tend to forget that we are His children. His children. We don't need to lie. Yes. I am going to call them up. I will call them. Call them up, then! Ruin your son's life. Be happy. Even the remote doesn't work here! Today I have realized that you don't want me to get married. That is the truth. Because of such things, I have turned 33. Eventually, I will turn 50, and yet be the same. Single. I won't be married, even then. But what difference does it make to you? You can be honest, all your life. What kind of a father are you? Can't you lie a little for your son? Call them up. Go on. Call them up. Go on. Why are you staring at me? Call them up. Do you really like that girl a lot? Yes? Okay. Fine. Then Kuljit will be my daughter-in-law. -Happy now? -Yes. Sonu is too much! He is so laid back. He doesn't even keep his discarded clothes together. Once he sees Kuljit, he forgets everything. Aunt has told me everything. She says my brother-in-law is very handsome. And that he is also a very famous advocate. Have you ever seen him? He is too rustic. Very rustic. Don't talk rubbish. Forget it. I know you are very happy. -Am I right? You are, aren't you? -Sonu. There is no happiness. Then what is it, joy? Tell me something. When will you introduce me to him? I will think about that. Your students are waiting for you. Go and teach them. You can meet your brother-in-law later. Yes, I will teach them. That's my job. -But I know, you are going to meet him. -Yes. You ruined me as you took my heart away You neither killed me nor kept me alive Hello. Remember me? Judge Singh! You neither killed me nor kept me alive Get in. I will drop you off. It's okay. I'll manage. She has attitude, she is worth the fight She is a beautiful lass She has attitude She is worth the fight She is a beautiful lass She is a beautiful lass Excuse me. I wanted to go to the advocate's house. No advocate stays here. His name is Judge. -Judge? That's his house. -Right there. She wears flowery dresses She is delicate like a flower She gives her approval through her eyes She wears flowery dresses She is delicate like a flower She gives her approval through her eyes One look at her gives an amazing high Hi. It's me! She has attitude, she is worth the fight She is a beautiful lass She has attitude, she is worth the fight She is a beautiful lass Hi. Hello? Where are you? I have been waiting for you. There is something fishy about that boy. Stop it. We have found a nice boy with great difficulty. And you are finding faults in him. She has gotten out of hand since she moved to the city. I suggest we get her married quickly. How can I just get her married? I want her to get married. I don't wish to throw her in a well. -Just hear me out. -Keep quiet. Tomorrow, I will go to court. I will go and see what the boy does. Yes. Okay. Yes. It's fixed on the fourth. What are you saying? I will come with a box of sweets and the invitation card. All right. Bring your entire family along. Sure. Bye. Judge! Judge, you haven't taken a bath yet? We have to go distribute the wedding invites. Dad, my underwear was kept here. Your underwear? Is this the one? You took my underwear! It's okay. I will remove it and give it back to you. -Let it be. I don't want it. -Hey. Why? Because it's used? Dad's phone call. -Dad? Who? -My father-in-law. Put it on speaker. -Hello, Dad. -Hi, my dear. Where are you? I'm at home, Dad. At home? Don't you have to go to court today? -Court? -The courthouse? The courthouse. Yes, Dad. I was getting ready to go there. I am going to the court, today. I will meet you in your chamber. -You are coming to court! -Yes. What now? Dad. JUDGE CALLING Judge, I am in the court. I will call you later. Okay? People keep bothering me. They keep calling, unnecessarily. -Go ahead, ma'am. -Dear, I think I should divorce Kasturilal and I should apologize, as well. Apologize? Ma'am, he should be apologizing, and not you. When will he apologize? I know you since I was a child. You used to consult my father for this case. And now, I am an advocate. But you are still fighting that very case. Look at my father's photograph. You know, it was his dream to bring you justice. And now, when we are close to victory, you want to surrender! That means 30 years of hard work will go waste. Ma'am, recall the days of your youth. When you used to attend a marriage or a function, people used to ask you where your husband is. -Were you able to answer them? -No. Oh, no. Ma'am, look how your laughter, your happiness, your smile has fallen down. But don't you worry. I will bring them back to you. Open your mouth. -God bless you, my dear. -All right? And I will surely bring you justice in this hearing. Understood? So, don't you give up. Hey. Watch where you are going. Hello? -Hello. -Yes? Hello? Judge, what is your chamber number? -Dad, I cannot hear you. -Are you blind? Can't you see? I asked, what your chamber number is. -Hello? -Hello. What's wrong? Can't you hear me? -Hello? -Hello? -Judge. Hello? -Yes, Dad. -Now I can hear you clearly. -What is your chamber number? My chamber number is 302. It's 302. I am coming to meet you. -Sure, Dad. -The thing is... -Ma'am, your case is over. -Alright, Son. -Okay? You can leave now. -Hey you! Hey! Judge. What are you doing, Judge? I had to take money from her. What is going on? You kept it here, again? -Keep it in the drawer. -Okay. And undress. Have you lost your mind? What are you saying? What are you doing? -Stupid fellow. -Undress. You closed the door of my chamber and started stripping? -Stop it. -What are you doing? Why are you stopping me? -Remove your clothes. -I am not into this. Yes. Okay. -Excuse me, Counselor. -Yes, sir? -Where is chamber number 302? -Chamber number 302 is upstairs. -Upstairs? -Yes, upstairs. Thank you. Why are you asking me to undress? At least tell me what's going on! Look, my marriage got fixed with great difficulties. -Yes. -My father-in-law has come to the court. -Okay. -Manga has told him that I am an advocate. -Yes. -If my father-in-law finds out -Yes. -that I don't have a chamber here, then he will call off the wedding. I need your clothes, please. Judge, let him come. Don't worry. -I will talk to him. Sit down. -You don't understand. Dad. -Hello, Dad. -Hello. -I seek your blessings. -God bless you. I hope you didn't have any trouble finding the place. No. I found it, quite easily. The paint? I got it done recently. It's newly painted. No, my dear. I am not talking about the paint. This photo? -My guru. He's my guru. -Oh, your guru? Come, have a seat. Have a seat. Son, don't you have to wear a white turban in the court? You are wearing a yellow one. Pardon me? You are wearing a yellow turban. -My turban? -Yes. Even courts allow a little fashion, these days. Have a seat. Sit down. -Vijay Soni! -What? Vijay Soni. -Hello. -Hi. Vijay Soni. I am fighting his case. Yes. Mr. Soni, he is fighting your case? Yes sir, he is fighting. Now what do I tell you? I've managed to get a meeting with him after six months. He doesn't have any time to spare. Good. Good. Very good. So you are satisfied with his work? Satisfied? What do I tell you? I never praise anyone in their presence. But you won't find... a better murder case specialist -in this court. -Wonderful! He is a very famous advocate. A murder specialist. I went to his chamber. I met him. Yes. I was wrong. I was suspecting him for no reason. After all, it concerns my daughter. One is bound to be concerned. Yes... Hold on. Hold on. I will call you back. Okay. Hold on. They are taking my son. -I have not done anything. -Let him go. -What happened, Sonu? -They are taking my son. -Sir... -Back off! -Uncle! -What will I do now? My son. My Sonu. It stinks. Judge, when was the last time you took a bath? -Why? -You really don't know? Even someone in the next city will know that I am wearing your coat. That's how much it stinks. Hey! Why are you stuffing this inside? Do you know what this is? -It's just a pen. -Just a pen, you say? You shouldn't touch the things you don't know about. This isn't a pen. It's a spy-cam. Look over here. Here's the camera. You are getting a call. Answer it. He doesn't know anything and yet he keeps fidgeting. -Yes, Dad? -Judge? Quickly get to the police station. -Police station? -Yes, the police station. Is everything alright? Get to the police station. -I will tell you what happened. -Okay, Daddy. -Sonu, give me your clothes. -Again? -I have not done anything. -I will make you confess what you did. Sir. -What? -We can hear his screams outside. His mother is here. -His mother is here? -Yes, sir. Okay, so your mother is here. The constable will tell your mother -that he has stopped the SHO. -That's right. With that assurance, that poor woman will go back home. But what will happen to you after she leaves? I have stopped the SHO at your behest. You may leave now. Fine! You do your job. I won't leave until you send my son with me. Listen to me, ma'am. It isn't that easy to get him released. He has been arrested under section 302. He won't even get bail. First, his papers will be submitted. Then he will be charged. Then after six months or a year, the hearing of his case will begin. He will be locked up until then. By then, you will beat him to... Look, I beg of you. For God's sake! Let him go. Let my son go! Release him. I cannot release him, ma'am. Neither can anyone else in this precinct release him. Now, only a good advocate can save him. Listen to me. Hire an advocate and get his remand time ended and get him sent to judicial custody. Judicial custody? Yes, in judicial custody. I mean, get him out of the lock-up and send him to jail. That will save him from the thrashing. Another thing. Don't tell anyone that I suggested this. -We are pressurized by the top management. -All right. Dad? -What happened? -Judge. Thank God you are here. -Do you know Sonu? -Yes. -Kuljit's aunt's son. -Yes. The police have arrested him. Really? Dad, you don't worry. Sit down. I will talk to them. Sit down. Constable, have you arrested Sonu? Don't you know what a nice boy he is? Tell me, what has he done? -Has he teased a girl? -No. No? He can never do that. I know that. He is a very decent boy. He must have gotten into a fight with someone. No, Counselor. Then did he buy a movie ticket from a black marketer? No! I got it. Now I know what makes you tick. Do one thing. Come here, please. Come here... Take this. Here you go. Please don't ask for more. Counselor, were you not made aware? -It's under 302... -No matter what section it is, let me tell you that I am an advocate. You all will regret this once I drag you all to the court. Counselor, you will have to go to court, anyway. He is being charged under section 302. -Section 302? -Yes. -You mean murder? -Yes. Soni, I might have a heart attack. I think Manga has decided the day of my death. How can I possibly get him judicial custody? -Now what will I do? -You have done the LLB, haven't you? You know how I have managed to do that. And that was eight years ago. How can I fight this case? It's not a big deal. Every advocate has to fight his first case to begin practice. Do this. Go home and read CLPC. If you face any problem, call me. But I have never stepped into a court. Do you want to see a courtroom? We will get you a divorce today. -Hello, sir. -The divorce must be done, today. Oh ma'am, you are back. -You too, sir? -Hello. How many times have I told you that frequent visits to court is just a waste of time and money. Exactly, Your Honor. That's what I told her. But she just doesn't understand. Isn't that right, ma'am? That's enough. So, as I was saying... So... I was saying, it has been 30 years. -Please continue. -Your Honor, I was saying that it has been 30 years... -Yes? -Sneeze first. It's okay. I will continue after that. -What is this? -Yes. Yes, please. Your Honor, please wipe over there. Continue. Your Honor, as I was saying, it has been 30 years... You! Why are you standing there? Either go outside or take a seat. Proceed. This case has been going on for the past 30 years. If they want to do it with mutual consent, then why involve the court? This is what I am saying, Your Honor. We have come here for a divorce, not to buy vegetables. Get them divorced and all the issues will be resolved. How can they get divorced? -Why? -Sir, we are in India. We live in a society that raises questions when a brother and sister are out together. But I object, Your Honor. Objection? What objection? Mr. Kasturilal can find another woman for himself. How will Mrs. Bimla Rani find another man for herself? So please, they shouldn't be divorced, sir. You guys just don't understand. I am giving you another chance. Think about what I said. I am giving you another date. -Next, please. -He has given another date, yet again. -What is this? -Don't worry. You don't have to worry about anything. Thank God that old lady didn't say anything in the court. Otherwise, I would be in trouble. I have bought my scooter on installments. We won't let them get divorced -till all the installments are paid. -True. You are thinking only about yourself. I will go crazy. Tell me what I need to do in the court in the morning. -Why are you so nervous, Judge? -What else do I do? -I have a case in the morning. -Wait a minute. Okay. I will give you a mantra which solves everything. No one will tell you about this. -No one but your friend. -Thank you. In the courtroom, if you think you are stuck and you don't have a reply to give them, then just be a nice boy and say one thing. This has nothing to do with our case. That's it. Come what may. Sir, your handkerchief. -Call me later. -Sir, your handkerchief. Mister, T.S. Brar doesn't pick up anything that has fallen down other than a fallen case. Sir, may I keep it as your blessing? Who is he? He is someone who can have the most powerful person arrested. T.S. Brar, the top-most counselor in Punjab. To see him is like seeing God. Listen, what is Brar doing here, today? -You know the MLA's daughter's case? -Yes. He is representing the state. This means I am fighting against Brar? -He is? -Yes. Best of luck. Who was that gentleman with you, back then? Who? Oh, that guy? He is my friend. Why do you ask? Have you lost your mind? -Why? -It's the MLA's case. To stand against him means press, media and everyone else will be witnessing this case. You keep running after small cases for a few thousand rupees. This single case can make you a millionaire. Understood? By the way, is he very close to you? No. He is not that close to me. Then what are you waiting for? Go for it. Lord Almighty. My dear, you didn't sleep the whole night. It's seven o'clock in the morning. Stop working on it now. -It's seven o'clock! -Yes. Move. Come here. Yes, sir? -Who are they? -I don't know, sir. Before I come in, can't you keep an eye... on what's happening around? Why is he sleeping over here? Let it be, sir. Is there a problem? Why are you yelling at the kid? And who are you? I don't know him. I am just saying, it's early in the morning. Don't ruin your mood. Keep calm. I asked you who you are! I am the advocate's father. Now how can I help you? Do you think you have come to attend a wedding? This isn't a marriage palace. This is a courtroom! Get up. Get up and sit over there. Dad, you don't know him. He is a well-reputed advocate, Mr. Brar. So what if he is a famous advocate? He cannot eat me up, can he? I will get you arrested. You can ask him. -Ask him who I am. -Yes. -Why don't you understand, Dad? -He is unnecessarily arguing -early in the morning to ruin the mood. -Sorry, sir. Lad, where have you studied law? At college. College? You don't know that the defense sits there and not here! -Go there! -Sorry, sir. -Go and sit over there. -Sorry... Sorry, he says! He thinks wearing a black coat makes him a lawyer. Sister-in-law... Dear, -take care of your aunt. -Okay. I will be back in a moment. Sister-in-law, I will be right back. -Okay. -Don't worry. You? -Hello. -Hi. Who is sleeping over here? Who is he? Wake him up. -Sorry, madam. -You can sleep if you want. We can have the hearing outside today. -Me? -Yes, you. Yes, ma'am? Are you an advocate? Yes, madam. And you don't know how to tie a tie? -Sorry, madam. -Ridiculous! -You are an advocate? -Yes, I am. I thought you are Judge's client. Client? You took that joke seriously from the other day? -Joke? -Yes, Judge was just messing with you. -You really don't know about it? -No. Seriously? Wait a minute. I will call him up, right away. He's too much. Okay, tell me what your case is. Madam, my client... Whose phone is ringing? Whose phone is it? Whose phone is it? So, it's your phone. Take it out. You sleep in the court. It's because you are having sleepless nights. Put it on speaker. Let me see who is giving you sleepless nights. Judge, did you see the real judge? You had said that you wouldn't give the judge a chance to speak. Sorry. I think the judge will eat you up. He hung up. Perhaps he is busy. It's his first case, after all. -First case? -Didn't you know? Okay, so your name is Judge? Yes, madam. I am a law graduate. My name is Judge. -Great. That's wonderful. -Your Honor. I am getting late. I have other appointments to attend. Please speed up. Fine, Mr. Judge Singh, tell us what your case is. Madam, my client didn't do anything. The police arrested him for no reason. I have applied for his bail. Mr. Judge, that's not how you say it. What do you mean? Not you, I was talking to him. The new counselor. Chap... You should say "application for bail." I wonder how he got to this point. His license should be seized. You are right, Mr. Brar. Just imagine how we tolerate such people, every day. It gives us a headache. Give it to me. What is this? You applied for an anticipatory bail? Your client has already been arrested. Yes, madam. That's right. Hey mister, you can apply for an anticipatory bail only if your client has not been arrested. You should now apply for a regular bail. Madam, this has nothing to do with our case. What? It has nothing to do with the case! -Mr. Brar. -Idiot! Forget about him. You tell me, what is the case? Ma'am, he is the prime suspect in MLA Harjeet Singh's daughter's murder case. Hold on, sir. Hold your tater! Hold your horses. My client's name isn't mentioned in the F.I.R. What do you mean by "hold your tater"? Mind your language, Mr. Judge. You are in a court, not in a fish market. Sorry, madam. Just because my tie is crooked and his coat is over ironed, it doesn't mean that no one will listen to me. Fine, read out the F.I.R. "I, Disha, son of Rulduram, testify that I and Manna had gone to the fields early in the morning at 5:00 a.m. to defecate. An airplane passed from above our heads. It was flying very low. I said, something is wrong. Then Manna said, let's hurry up. So I started hunting for a stone in the ground and I found someone's feet, instead. I began to scream in fear. Then I called the police. The police came right away, exactly after two hours." Madam, tell me, where was my client's name mentioned in it? On what grounds is he being held the prime suspect? Madam, the police found the murder weapon and clothes drenched in blood from his house. If you approve bail to someone who commits such a serious crime, then people will lose faith in the justice system. Hence, the state requests you to send this boy on police remand for at least 15 days for the thorough investigation of this case. Mr. Brar is right. Mr. Judge, tell me. What is the problem? Are you joking with me? Joking? Hold on. Brother, can I have a word with you? -Yes, Sir. -Tell him my chamber number. It's 302. Why? What happened? -Nothing. Wash your hands and leave. -Fine. I haven't lied to you. Judge and I studied law together. He took five years to complete a three-year course. -Five years? -Yes, that too, eight years ago. I wonder what he will do in the court today. I feel sorry for his client, to be honest. He wants to get him judicial custody. But I'm certain he will have him imprisoned. Madam, I say, if they have already found the murder weapon and other evidence from my client's house, then why do they need to keep him in police remand? They are going to file charges against him, anyway. Ma'am, Mr. Brar seeks police remand so that my client can be tortured and made to confess a lie, forcefully. This is an insult to our justice system. Ma'am, until my client is sentenced as a criminal, the responsibility of his security lies with the court. Just once, try to place yourself in his mother's place. If your innocent son is trapped like this, then would you send him to judicial custody or to the police to get him tortured even more? That's all, Your Honor. This is a court. You cannot get any order passed by making people emotional. So, the application for bail is dismissed. Congratulations, Mr. Brar. The police have already made a recovery against the accused. This case is based on circumstantial evidence. Hence, the accused is shifted to judicial custody. What's happening? Stop it. -Sit down. -Don't worry, ma'am. Police cannot trouble Sonu in judicial custody. Be brave. -He is right. -Okay, my dear. So, when will my son be released? As we got the judicial custody, we will get bail as well. Dad, what are you doing here? We were waiting for you, inside. You should be ashamed of yourself. You lied to me! But Dad, I had told you... You think you are very clever? This was your first day in court. That too because of us! Listen to us, Mr. Amrik Singh. Oh, you shut up. -Idiot! Shameless people! -Hold on, sir. You cannot talk to my father in this manner. Why can't I talk to your father in this manner? It is your father's fault! You did things according to the values he taught you. The other day, you acted so innocent and said that your son is a famous advocate. He is no advocate! You guys don't know how to work hard. All you can do is lie! Hence, your son is still idle. Hence, your son is still useless. Hence, your son is still single. I thank God for showing me your true status before the wedding. What are you saying, Amrik? -This poor guy... -Don't intervene, Sister-in-law. Let me talk to them! Look Mr. Amrik Singh, I beg of you. No, I beg of you. Don't show me your faces, ever again. And don't ever try to contact me! Let's go, Sister-in-law. I don't want to talk to such people. Let's go, dear. Which path should I choose? Whom should I express my feeling to? Which path should I choose? Whom should I express my feeling to? I have never faced such sorrow I keep falling at every step Life... Plays hide and seek Life... Plays hide and seek Ever since my beloved Severed ties with me I lost my mind Everyone knows, it's me Ever since my beloved Severed ties with me I went crazy Everyone knows, it's me I cannot go forward I cannot go back My ship sank Where I couldn't swim to shore Life... Plays hide and seek -Let's go, Judge. -Come on, Judge. Get up. -Come on. -Come on, get up. How can he just call it off? Right. You cannot lose hope like that. Come with me. I will talk to Amrik. There is still hope. Sometimes people say things in a fit of anger. This doesn't mean that the wedding is called off. Look, Kuljit is here. Now Kuljit... She will convince her father. Why would I do that? Get out of here. Leave! Out. Get out! -Leave. -That's enough, Kuljit. What? I didn't like you since the day we met. -Hold on. Let me talk to them. -Get out of here. -Let's go! -You guys are so stubborn. You came back here even after being humiliated. -Kuljit, listen to me. -Get out of here. Get out from here! Get out! -Kuljit... -Get out. You too! -Get in. -Leave. They want an alliance! Get out. -Get out! -Listen to me, dear. Get out. Dear... I have been looking for you. Judge, come and eat dinner. Come on! You should listen to your father. You are my son, aren't you? Today, I asked Laxmi to make your favorite dishes, potato cauliflower curry and lentils. Let's go, my son. I am starving. My good boy. My baby. My good boy. Get up. Get up, son, or I will... I will be angry with you. Come on, let's eat our dinner. Be a good boy, now. Come on. Get up. Come with me. That's enough, Dad! You have said enough. Go away from here. You have already done enough. Go. Sorry. I think I said something wrong to you. Sorry. -Sorry, Dad. -Judge! Sorry. -Sorry, Dad. -No, my dear. -Don't cry, my dear. -Sorry. Don't... Sorry. No... No, my dear. Don't cry. Don't cry, my dear. Don't cry! You were absolutely right. You were right. I was the one who was wrong. I could never make you happy in my life. God should never give a child like me to anyone... Hey. Don't you dare... Don't you dare say such a thing. I will slap you if you say that! Don't cry, my dear. Oh, my child. You are the reason I have survived. Dad, I never thought about it. You are taking care of all the responsibilities by yourself. But not anymore. I have enjoyed a lot but not anymore. Now, I will become someone you can be proud of. Yes. is it fine, Father? -What? -Is this fine? Let me take a look at it. Lift it a little from the right. A little higher. Not that much. A little lower. -Lower. -Here you go. -Lower... -How about now? You have made it crooked. Lift it a little higher. Dad, you are not giving me proper instructions. Here. Now, it's fine. Is it fine? That's enough. Yes. That's it. Put it over here. And that's how you put up a board. Well done. Sir... Dad? -Where are you going? -Why? Doesn't an advocate need an assistant? Look, Mother. Your son Judge is now an advocate. Just give me your blessings. You only want your mother's blessings? And not your father's? -Dad, you always come first. -God bless you, my dear. God bless you, my child. God bless you. May you prosper. -Now go and sit on your chair. -Dad, you should sit on it first. No. It's yours. You should sit on it. Sit on it, just once. You want to make your father cry? Go and sit on it. -Jai Hind, Advocate. -Dad! -We want to get married... -Excuse me... -Excuse me. Come here. -Sir... -You too. -What are you doing? -Practicing. -They are my clients. -He is strange. -Come inside. Sit over here. -You ran off from your house? -Yes. And now you want to get married? -Yes. -You mean love marriage? Yes. You have to begin from somewhere. Of course! You have come to the right place. Dad... Say cheese. Okay? Didn't I tell you your job will be done in three hearings? I got it done. Henceforth, if you have work related to the court... Do tell me if you need anything. Yes. I will get all your work done in this manner. -Mom. -Sonu. What is the advocate saying? Sonu, listen to me very carefully. I have studied your case. T.S. Brar has gathered... such evidences against you which are infrangible. You'll be sentenced to death, for sure. -I know you didn't kill her. -No, sir. I didn't kill her. Yes, but if you confess that you killed her, in court, then I won't let them give you a death sentence. What are you saying? You will be imprisoned for 11 to 12 years. It will be over in no time. What are you saying, Counselor? This is just the first hearing. You are saying disheartening things even before the decision is made. Save my son. At any cost. We are ready to do whatever you say. Ma'am, I am not saying anything disheartening. Whatever I am saying is for your own good. If you still have doubts, you can consult another advocate. It's time for the case. I am going inside. Come inside quickly. Let's go. -Let's go. -Uncle. Amrik... -Sister-in-law... -Sir, Mr. Soni's fees? -Fees? -Yes. Doctor, on 22nd April, 2014, the corpse of a person named Simranjeet -was sent to you. -Yes. -Did you perform on her post mortem? -Yes. Cause of death? That girl was attacked with a dagger seven times on her chest. It caused her heart to rupture. Silence! This is not an ordinary murder. This is a murder that everyone in this society is talking about. Whether it's media or the newspaper headlines, everyone is talking about that girl's murder. Why? Because it was an innocent girl's murder. She was attacked not once, but seven times. Her beating heart was attacked. Her heart was sliced opened. What's surprising... is that her murderer is roaming fearless in our society. In the future, the murderer can kill children or he can kill housewives or even the working ladies, even you... I mean, he can kill anyone. Hence, I request the court in strong words that this murderer shouldn't be put behind bars. He should instead be hanged to death. Amrik, I am very scared. -I am feeling very scared. -Nothing will happen, Sister-in-law. Your Honor, today I will prove in this court that the murderer is no one other than this monster cloaked behind this innocent face! This person with an innocent looking face. Yes? -Your witness, please. -No questions, Your Honor. My dear, why don't you ask something? I know what I need to ask. Please don't bother me. Sister-in-law! The police department submitted that dagger to you. Yes. Do you have its forensic report? The blood on the dagger matched the corpse's blood. You mean to say that you are absolutely certain that the murder was done with that dagger? -Yes. -Your Honor, the police found that dagger in his house. I believe that we don't need any other evidence, anymore. Your Honor, my next and important witness, the only prime witness of this case is Satnam Singh. -Me? -Yes, you come here. It's very hot in here. Mr. Satnam Singh, tell me, what did you see on the night of the 21st of April? I was going to the fields. I heard a girl scream. A boy was shoving a dagger in her, repeatedly. -Can you identify that boy? -Me? Once I look at a person, his image is copy-pasted in my mind. Then tell us who that person is. He is standing right in front of you. He is the one who killed her. Did you see that? They are very powerful. And all the evidences are also against us. You should heed my advice... My Lord, I would like you to refer to the judgment on page number 120 in the booklet provided. What god's wish... Mom, have you lost your mind? Why are you talking to a murderer's mother? Come with me. My son is not a murderer. My son is not a murderer! Sonu didn't kill anyone. He didn't! Let me give you an advice. You don't need to suffer anymore. Just go to TS Brar. Either give him money or plead before him. He is the only one who can save your son from being hanged. In the Simran murder case, advocate TS Brar has requested a death sentence for the accused Sonu. Let's see what the people have to say about it. He should be punished. This boy should be shot to death at the community crossroad. I say, why is he still alive? Punish him, right away. If this boy is not punished, then the people will punish him. -He should be punished. -He should be punished. -Excuse me, madam. -Yes, sir? We wanted to meet Mr. Brar. He is in a meeting, sir. You will have to wait. Sure. Sister-in-law, why don't you understand? I think we are making a huge mistake by doing this. Amrik, you have already consulted so many advocates. None of them agreed to help. I want to meet him, once. He too has a mother. It is possible that he listens to me and helps us. And then we too will be assured that we tried everything possible. Sister-in-law, these people are not how you think they are. They won't understand us. Vijay Soni is a very good advocate. We should trust him. Heed my advice. Let's go from here. Sister-in-law, please. Please. He will wear a noose and you, a tie. I don't care if he is hanged. But I should get what I want. -I know. -How do you know? Everyone at the court knows. You... You want my son dead? -You want my son dead? -Ma'am! -What are you doing, ma'am? -You want him dead? -Sister-in-law! No, please! -Go away. Get lost. Sister-in-law! Disgustful acts seem to have no limit when it comes to you. God helps those who are not helped by anyone. Let's go, Sister-in-law. Don't worry. Such people are not worth... Sister-in-law, why don't you tell me which advocate have you appointed? Where is he? Your Honor, what's going on here? The defense lawyer is still not here. I'm supposed to wait for him? T.S. Brar is fighting this case. So, where is your advocate? If you don't have one, you can be provided a public defender. Don't waste our time. No, Your Honor. Give us a little more time. -He is on his way. -What is this? Sister-in-law... Sister-in-law, what have you done! Why did you call him? How will he fight the case against Brar? Amrik, he might not be an experienced advocate but he isn't corrupt like the others. Oh my! Mr. Judge is back in my court. Come, have a seat. Should I call for tea or refreshments for you? Sorry, madam. -I am a little late. -You should have informed us. I would have postponed this case till tomorrow. -Sorry, madam. -Wonderful! Today, your tie's knot is perfect as well. Yes, madam. My phone is also on silent mode. Mr. Brar, did you miss me? I will make you miss your granny. Your Honor, request for re-examination of prosecution witness Satnam Singh. Request has been already filed. Great. Such fluent English, so quickly? Where did you learn it? -Go ahead. Call your witness-- -Your Honor, the witness has already been examined. To call him back to the court is a waste of the court's time. Is this a joke? No, Mr. Brar. This is not a joke. For your kind information, according to section number 311 of the CRPC, it is the right of the defense to recall a witness any number of times if it leads to bring forth the truth. Understood? Go ahead and call your witness, please. Thank you, ma'am. -Mr. Satnam Singh. -Yes? At what time were you passing through the fields? Around 12:30. -12:30 a.m.? -Yes. So, Mr. Satnam Singh, it must be quite bright out there. What are you talking about, sir? Why would there be light at that hour? It was pitch black darkness. One person couldn't recognize the other. In fact, I stepped on dung a few times. It's okay, Mr. Satnam. It happens, sometimes. Okay, now... -Take a good look at this photo. -I saw it. Mr. Satnam, we are not in a hurry. Have a good look at it. Sir, perhaps you don't know me well. My name is Satnam Singh. I have a photographic memory. Once I see something, its image gets copy-pasted in my mind. Okay. So, have you pasted this one? Your Honor, this is for your reference. Mr. Brar, -this one is for you. -Move. Your Honor, I would like to request the lights of the courtroom to be turned off. Hey! This is not a film set. This is a real courtroom. Your Honor, what kind of a joke this is? It's okay, Mr. Brar. Have a seat. Be comfortable. Sit down, please. -Please have a seat. -But he... It's okay. Let him fulfill his desire. We will get to see something new. Besides, I am having a lot of fun in the courtroom today. Okay, turn the lights off. Hold on, ma'am. Wait for 15 minutes. There is going to be a power cut anyway. Stand there quietly. Don't you know how to talk to a judge? -Sorry. -Idiot! Mr. Satnam, it must have been this bright the other night. No, sir. It was pitch black darkness there. One person couldn't recognize the other. But people are visible here. Okay. So you mean it was darker -than it is over here. -Yes. And how far away were you from the crime scene? Move back a little. Here? Take four steps back and move to your left. Move to your left. -Okay. Here? -Yes! Absolutely. Please come in. -Mr. Satnam... -Yes? Please tell the court, from the photo I showed you... Yes. Which one of them is the person from the photo? That's simple. This one. -The one on the left? -Yes. -Lights on! -No. Hold on. Goddess, help me. I'm sure it's this one. This one. -Him? -Yes. For sure. -For sure? -Yes. Are you sure? Tell me. Since you asked me if I'm sure, I'll say it's him. -This one, for sure? -Yes. Okay. Lights on. Have a look at the photo, ma'am. It's neither of them. God bless you. No wonder I was getting so confused. When he couldn't recognize the person in the photograph, in such brightness then how did he recognize him the other night? Your Honor, he is a false eyewitness. He is a liar. Mr. Brar, a lie doesn't last long. Sir, what if we lose the case? The dead can never wake up from the grave. Hello, SHO. Come and meet me in my office. Go. Dad, why aren't you playing? Go on. Why did you take on this case again? Is it because of Kuljit? No, Dad. Dad! What's going on in your mind? -Tell me. -My dear, Brar... The MLA... I suggest, you should leave this case. How does it concern us? Son, we are decent people. We are not like them. I know we are not like them, Dad. But we cannot turn a blind eye to a man dying before us. No, Dad. We are not such cruel people. What is the inspector here for? Welcome, sir. You will live a long life. I was just thinking about you. What have I done to you? No, you have done us no harm. Sir, I was looking for the crime scene photographs of this case. I couldn't find them. You took them, didn't you? We did. Why wouldn't we take them? Let me tell you a funny incident. Actually, our photographer was a rookie. At the last moment, that idiot forgot to put the film in the camera. Get some refreshments, Laxmi. The inspector... The inspector is here. No, sir. Don't bother with the refreshments. You should take this. This is a gift. Mr. Brar has sent this for you. Mr. Brar said there is no use arguing. We should do something which benefits both him and you. Here. Mr. Judge, take it. Mr. Judge, take it. It's money. It has come to you. You shouldn't refuse it. Take it, sir. That's great. All right, then. Goodbye. Why did you take it? Tell me! Why did you take it? You crazy ones, recognize me Where have I come from? Who I am? Who I am? Don! Don! Don! BIG MOVE FOR TS BRAR He is the first user of TS Brar's public mobile toilet. Let's talk to him. Sir... -Are you from the news channel? -Yes. -Really? -Yes. Hold this, please. What do you want to ask me? How was your experience? A while back, I was miserable. I can't even tell you! I felt as if I would never be free from the burden. But now I'm so relieved, as if there was no burden in the first place. Okay? Would you like to say a few words about Mr. Brar? -Mr. Brar is a very nice man. -Okay. But it would have been even better if he provided free meals too. Now, we have Advocate Judge Singh with us. Come, let's talk to him. -Yes, sir. -So... Mr. Brar sent me the money the day before yesterday and asked me to do it. He wanted to do something good for the welfare of the people. Because he believes that, since advocates make a lot of money, we must use it responsibly. So, I hope, Mr. Brar donates for more such mobile toilets... You... You turned me into a toilet supplier? This is everywhere... People have schools built in their name or even hospitals. But Mr. Brar got toilets made, instead. There is a shortage of toilets. Mr. Brar, you have done a great job. Get lost. Great job, you say? Get out! I think everyone will benefit from this. And it will make Mr. Brar very famous. What are you staring at? On behalf of everyone... Sir, what Judge did was not right. -I thank him. Thank you, Mr. Brar. -Come here. And the enthusiasm I can see here among the people for the mobile toilet... Who ironed your shirt? -How much time did you take to iron it? -It took 15 minutes. It took 15 minutes! You spent 15 minutes to iron it? You are wearing ironed shirt! -You want to wear an ironed shirt? -Sir... Now go and iron it for half an hour. Leave! Mr. Brar is a well-known advocate. Mr. TS Brar's name will also get famous for his mobile toilets. -Yes, Mr. Brar? -Dubey, tell me, did Judge say anything when you went to his house? No. What can he possibly say? He just asked about the photographs. Photos? Don't underestimate him. You deleted them, didn't you? Yes, I deleted them. I set them on fire. Did anyone else... take photographs that night? No. That is out of question. Oh no. Sir, it's highly doubtful but there were one or two reporting photographers. You scoundrel, couldn't you have dealt with it right at the beginning? Quickly find out about it. If he gets the photographs, he will make me... Do you understand what I am trying to say here? I understand, sir. Don't worry. I will go there, right away. I will go there, right away, sir. Hey, start the jeep. PUNJABI JAGRAN -Where is the director? -Inside. -Yes, sir? -The crime scene of MLA's daughter... -Yes. -Did you take the photographs? I am talking to you. Why are you looking over there? Mr. SHO. Let me tell you about a funny incident. You are late. Your Honor, these are the photographs of the crime scene which have still not been presented in this courtroom. Because the police made these photographs disappear to save MLA Harjeet Singh's son Garry Mann. What do you mean? People mock the court because of such novices. This is the justice system! It follows rules. Young man, you too will have to follow these rules. Mister, the justice system is made to serve justice and not for the rules. I think you are baffled after looking at the photographs. You may submit the photographs. What? I agree that you are the judge, but that doesn't mean you can do as you please. -Mr. Brar... -Being a judge, -you should be following rules. -Mr. Brar... How can these photographs be submitted? Mr. Brar! Neither do we know about the photographer. -Mr. Brar! -Nor do these have any negatives. -Mr. Brar! -How is it possible? -Sit there! Cool down. -Don't forget that you have been my junior. -Sit there, Mr. Brar. -You have learnt everything from me. I said, shut up! Shut up! Don't you forget that you are talking to a judge. You won't teach me what I should be doing. Sit there! Go and take your seat. A judge always tries... to save an innocent whether or not a hundred criminals are punished. So Mr. Judge, you may proceed now. -Disha, son of Rulduram. -Yes. -Mr. Disha? -Yes. Do you recognize this person? Yes, Counselor. She is the same girl. When we had gone to relieve ourselves in the morning, she is the one whose feet I had found. How can I forget her? You can even ask Mann. Doctor, have a look at this post-mortem report. Okay. Both these reports are from your lab. Yes, they are. Now look at this photograph and tell me with which post-mortem report does it match? This one. Richa Sharma. -With Richa Sharma? -Yes. But doctor, this is the photograph of Simranjeet Kaur. How did this happen? No... This is not possible. This shouldn't have happened, but it did, Doctor. Now you tell us how it happened. Tell us. -Tell us, how it happened, Doctor. -Your Honor... Tell us how this happened. Please, tell us. Tell us, Doctor. Tell us. -Please, tell us. Tell the court. -It is possible. My staff must have made some mistake. Because Your Honor, it's always his staff that makes a mistake. -He never makes a mistake. -What's happening, Brar? Whenever there is a successful operation, he takes the credit. He gets the medal. But when the post-mortem reports get changed, it's his staff that is blamed. Doctor, I think you should change your staff. Your Honor, these photos clearly indicate that the murder never took place with a dagger. Mr. Brar is misleading the court with false evidence. Now check the post-mortem report and tell us. What was the cause of death? This girl was killed due to a head injury with an object that looks like a gear. Hold on. Mr. Garry Mann, -may I have your bracelet? -No. I cannot give it to you. Why can't you? It's a gift from my sister. Okay. So, you kill your sister and then you also carry her gifts with you? What nonsense! What are you saying? Hold on. Give it to me. Tahil. Give it to me. Darn! -Doctor. -Yes. Could the metal gear be something like this? Probably, it was done with something like this. Not probably, Your Honor. The murder was certainly done with this bracelet. Everyone present in this court knows that Garry Mann didn't like his sister's boyfriend. And hence, he killed her. But no FIR can be filed against Garry Mann because MLA have many contacts. Hence, this poor boy is being used as a scapegoat. Thus, Mr. Brar got the post-mortem reports changed. Thus, Mr. Brar got false witnesses. Thus, Mr. Brar planted blood stained clothes and the dagger in his house. Gift from sister. Mr. Brar, he isn't a major risk to our society. But he is. Fine. Your Honor, new evidence have come to light. Hence, the state requests some time. Take your time. But now there is no evidence against my client. Hence, I request the court to grant bail to my client. I have already submitted the application. Bail granted. Detailed orders will follow. -Mr. Judge... -Wait. It takes two to three days for the order to be approved. Don't do that, aunt. My dear, you... You have messed with the wrong guy. Now, you will see what I'm capable of. So? How are you? -I am fine. How are you? -I am doing well. Thank you. What are you saying? I don't understand. Kuljit, try to understand. That girl has Canadian citizenship. This is a question of my life. In fact, it will benefit both of us. Please, don't say such things. Say that it's a joke. You are joking, right? Why are you crying? Why are you crying, my love? Eat this pastry. Eat it. I don't want to eat it. You are worried about the pastry? Will you listen to me, Kuljit? Will you listen to me? Get married to someone else. What did you say? I should get married? To someone else? Have you lost your mind? How can you ask me to marry someone else? How can you even imagine that? -Relax. -Why should I relax? I lied to my parents because of you and you are asking me to marry someone else? Just because you want to go to Canada? Why are you creating a scene? I am creating a scene? I am creating a scene! Shall I tell you what's creating a scene? This is how one creates a scene. Like this. Excuse me! You're not the only ones here. Go outside and fight. Judge! Judge! -Where are you? -Manga? Judge? -Manga? -Listen... -I want to talk to you. -You are drunk? -Come with me. Come. -I am very upset. -You are sloshed. -I want to tell you something. -Sit down first. -Listen to me. I lie to unite two people. I do it to do something good for others. Fine. But what is the matter? Now how do I tell you? I don't want to break your heart. You won't break my heart. Tell me what happened. Judge, we are very naive. This world is very smart. -It is not what it seems like. -Manga, you... The ones who seem the most innocent are the biggest liars. They look innocent but the devil resides in them. They are not trustworthy. -That's right. -Something else altogether. -Why didn't I think of it? -Bring for me also. Judge. Judge, listen to me. Listen! I want to talk to you. CENTRAL JAIL 1950 SATYAMEV JAYTE Sir. Sir! The cops are at our door. Cops? -Hello. -Hello. What made you come to my humble abode with your entourage? I was just passing by. So, I thought of paying Judge a visit. -Hello. -Hello. Hello. You remember, I had come to your house with the money the other day? How can I forget you? By the way, where is Judge? Judge... He has gone to the neighboring village for some work. Why don't you have some refreshments before you leave? We were here for the refreshments! Let's go. We will drink tea as well as water. Who is calling at such an early hour? It stopped ringing. Hello? Sonu? Thank God, my friend. Thank God, you are out on bail. I cannot tell you how scared I was. I was even breathing stealthily. I feared that if you confessed at the police station that you killed Simran, then I too would have been hanged along with you. I suggest we should go visit a Gurudwara. -Who is this? -It's me, Preet. Who answered the phone? -Hi. -Hi. Look what I brought for you. Bracelet? I brought one for you and one for my brother Garry. -It's beautiful, isn't it? -It's very beautiful. Just like you. How could you even think that we will approve of your relationship with him? Look at our level and look at his. What did you see in that monkey? Garry, I love him. And how dare you beat him up? For now, I have only beaten him up. If you don't stop seeing him, -I will kill him. -What? And you will be responsible for that. Only you. It's been so many days. Simran didn't come to meet me, even once. I beg you to stop, my friend. You got your head cracked open because of her. And you're still bothered about her. You should forget about her. The number you're trying to reach is currently unavailable. Simran. Simran. Simran. Simran! -Hello, Simran? -Yes, what is it? Simran, Sonu slit his wrist. -I cannot help him. -He will die, Simran. -He is crazy about you. -But what can I do? For God's sake, please do something. -Fine. -Right away. -Okay, I'll do something. -Hurry up. Hey, she is here. Sonu, you seem absolutely fine. So, you lied to me? What is this nonsense? Nonsense? Nonsense! Okay, don't you think -what you have done to me is nonsense? -Me? Garry beat me up because of you. Because of you, I spent days in the hospital. I kept calling you, repeatedly. Sonu, I am doing this for your own good. Garry will kill you. So please, move on. My family has arranged my marriage with someone else. And I will marry that boy. You are joking, right, Simran? Simran... Tell me it's not true. -Sonu... -Simran, -please don't leave me. -Sonu. Sonu, try to understand. -Sonu. -I cannot live without you, Simran. What are you doing, Sonu? -Please don't leave me, Simran. -Sonu... -I beg of you. I plead you, Simran. -Sonu... Sonu! -Control yourself, Sonu. -Please don't leave me. -Sonu... -I cannot live without you. Please get up, Sonu. -I cannot live without you. -Sonu... I cannot live without you! I cannot live without you! You know that, don't you? Did you just slap me? You slapped me... How dare you! Sonu! CENTRAL JAIL 1950 STYAMEV JAYTE -My dear, are you all right? -Yes, Uncle. I am fine. Come with me. Oh my God. It's a beautiful picture of you and your son. Your son has become a renowned advocate now. You should be proud of him. Absolutely. I am. You like fish. Judge Singh loves fish. -Sir! -Quiet. Quiet. Sorry. What are you looking at? Go inside. That's a beautiful photograph. Who is she? She is Judge Singh's mother. -What? -No! Sorry. It broke. It's his mother, right? She is the one who gave birth to him. She gave birth to that snake. What was that noise? I should check. Judge, you? What are you doing over here, my dear? Nothing, ma'am. I was just... Ma'am, is Sonu back? No. Why? What happened? Then who answered my call? Call? So, I must get going now, ma'am. I have some work. Judge. My dear, sometimes, kids make mistakes. Ma'am... You knew it? -Go in. God bless you, my dear. -Thank you, Uncle. Go. -You lied to me! -Judge, please listen to me. -I won't fight your case. -Listen to me. -Please forgive me. -Listen to me. I have never seen such disgusting people in my life. -Listen to me. -Judge... What's happening? Judge, what is going on? So you're unaware, just like I was? Ask your nephew what's going on. What's happening? Fully relaxed. I enjoyed relieving myself in your house. Your son loves to start off mobile toilets, doesn't he? I thought I too should inaugurate one. I didn't bring goons with me because I... I am TS Brar. That's me! The police is with me, the lawyers are with me. The ministers are with me. Even the entire government is with me. Hence, you must convince your son to get out of my way, this time. Otherwise, I will make the people of your village defecate in your courtyard. I will turn your house into a graveyard. You... better explain this to your son Judge Singh LLB. I will. I surely will. That when a dog gets scared, he begins to bark. And this time, the dog is very scared. One more thing, Brar. -What? -I come from a family whose kids' hearts were removed and stuffed into their mouth. But they never strayed from their path. Whom are you trying to scare? Just by holding this gun, you think you can kill me? If you have the courage, then shoot me. Shoot. Shoot me. Shoot me! Yes, what do you want? Just... give me something... which stops my heart from hurting. This world is very cruel, mister. Give me something which makes it look less cruel. Perhaps this is your first visit to a bar. Take this. Have a beer. Laxmi. Who had come here? Who did all this? Tell me! Where is Dad? Dad? Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! What happened, Dad? What happened, Dad? Who did all this? Judge, for the sake of your dead mother... For my sake, my dear, you must crush... Brar's ego. Crush it. Why is the world bent upon fooling me alone? Why would the world want to fool you? Stop it now. I'm very stressed, already. Daddy! I want to marry Judge. That's it. This is what was left to be done. Now you got me insulted too. Let it be. I will talk to Judge. He dances to my tune. -Hello? -Ma'am. It's me, Judge. I said a lot of things to you in the heat of the moment. Don't worry. I will fight your case. -Thank you very much, my dear. -No, it's okay. -See you in the court, tomorrow. -Okay. Okay. It was Judge. He said he would fight our case. Thank you, God. I thank you! Don't thank God, Mom. You should thank that stupid MLA. He still thinks that his son committed the murder. Dad, why don't you understand? I didn't kill Simran. Shut up! Stop your nonsense. I am fed up with your nonsense. Hello? Get this straight. If you lose this case, then I will be your worst enemy. MLA sir, why are you getting worried? Even if something goes wrong, I will approach the high court and have everything settled in two hours-- I will lose my reputation if I lose this case. -Sir. -Yes. May I come in? Why have you come here? You are my godfather. I am your student. How could I quit your patronage? May I sit? Sir, you may think that you have won the case. Don't worry, sir. We will win for sure. -So, Mr. Brar. -Yes? You were asked to make preparations. Are you prepared? Yes, I am. Of course I am. -Go and call him. -Okay. Hurry up, will you? So, mister. -What is your name? -Prithvipal Singh Mahla. -Prithvipal Singh Mahla. -Yes. What do you know about this case? Nothing, sir. I don't know anything. -Nothing? -Yes. Do you know that boy sitting right there? He is my friend, sir. -Okay. -Yes. -He is your friend. -Yes. Look, be a lamb... and tell the court whatever you know. I assure you that I won't let anything happen to you. Really, sir. I... I don't know anything. Prithvipal, you do know! And today, you will tell everything to the court. You know that you didn't commit the murder. -I didn't, sir. -You also know who the murderer is. You also know that you have a sister. You also know that you have a mother. You also know that your father is no more. You are shouldering the responsibility of your family. Think about it. If you go behind the bars, who will marry your sister? It is possible that this shock might kill your mother. -It is also possible... -No, sir. -...that your sister hangs herself. -No, sir. -And commits suicide. -No, sir! -You will be responsible... -No, sir. -for all this. -No, sir! Sonu has committed this murder, sir. Sir, Sonu has committed this murder. Sir, I witnessed IT. Sir, Sonu killed Simran. I didn't do anything, sir. Didn't I tell you he killed her? That's all, Your Honor. Chap, you are naive. Mr. Judge, would you like to question him? No, ma'am. I have no questions for him. You may leave, please. Ma'am, I have a request. If you could please play this CD in the court. Okay, ma'am. -Sonu killed her? -Yes. My God! We unnecessarily did so many things. I... planted the dagger in his house. I planted the blood stained clothes. I got a false post-mortem report prepared. I gave a lot of money to many people, as well. That's not something new. Did you bribe the doctor, as well? The doctor? Of all the cases that I have won, most of them have been won in this very manner. The case was dismissed on the grounds of evidence, otherwise I would have even bribed the judge. Really? But I don't understand something. Why did the MLA have to do all this? The MLA didn't love his daughter. He just loves his position. -Okay. -He got scared. If his image is ruined in front of the party, he won't get a ticket. Excuse me. -Hello. -Judge... Your Honor, my mother named me. Excuse me. My mother wanted me to become an advocate. I took five years to complete a three-year law course because I wasn't paying attention to my studies. My mother thought that lawyers are very honest people. They help people get justice. My mother was innocent. Because madam, no one here cares about the truth. All people care about is winning. And for that, they turn numerous truths into lies and vice-versa. Your Honor, I'm happy to have lost this case because the truth has triumphed, not the lie. Every day, thousands of people keep all their work aside and walk out of their houses thinking that perhaps justice will be brought to them, that day. But what do they get? In 1857, when Macaulay formed the I.P.C, he has made a pocket at the back of this black coat so that the common man could put the lawyer's fees in it, according to their status. But nowadays, that one pocket has turned into many and are now placed in front of this coat. That's why in every household people fear the government officials. Sir, you too should have a look at your uniform. It is so dirty. Not from the outside. Peep inside. And he is the MLA We must applaud for him. Your Honor, he is not grieving for the loss of his daughter. Instead, he fears that he'll be removed from his powerful position. Mr. Brar, I have nothing personal against you. Nor am I talking about just one advocate. I am talking about every person who is polluting our judicial system. Sorry, Your Honor. I think, I am wasting the court's time. I said a little too much. Sorry. Sorry. Your Honor, please don't stop me today. Today, he deserves applause. -Very good. -Well done, Mr. Judge Singh. I like the way you think. I am proud of you. Mr. Brar, today I feel embarrassed that I was once your junior. Now, I will make a special request to the BAR Counsel to cancel your license and to have a strict action taken against you. And an inquiry should be conducted on all those people who are involved in this case. And Sonu must be taken into custody. And detailed orders will follow soon. -Let's go. Get up. Let's go. -No. -He is staring at us. -Sonu... For the video footage of Mr. Brar, -did you use this pen? -Yes. -It is called a spy-cam. -Look, this is a camera. It's installed in front of it. Mr. Brar got humiliated. -We quit. -Goodbye. Give way. Move. Sorry, Judge. I sold my conscience for money. Forget it. It's okay. This would not have been possible had you not done what you did. -Your pen was very helpful. -Really? It ruined Brar. Why are you laughing? Do you think that you have brought me down? I can ruin people like you in a jiffy. Like this. I am Brar. T.S. Brar! I will make sure I teach you a lesson. This man standing next to you has witnessed what I'm capable of. I went into your house, I opened the fridge, I... -And you couldn't do me any harm. -You...! Mr. Brar, does your ear hurt? Heat up some mustard oil and apply it. Well done, champion. Some win and some become sore losers. Good, Judge. Good. Very good. Well done. -I salute you. I salute you. Okay. -Bye. Let's go, Dad. My dear, didn't I tell you -that truth eventually wins? -Judge! Judge... I want to tell you something. -Yes, tell me. -I am really sorry, Judge. I am really sorry for whatever happened. Sir, I am sorry. My father and I were rude to you. It's okay. It happens. It's all right. I thought about it and I realized that I was wrong. But now I am ready. Let's get married, Judge. You are very funny. Let's go, Dad. Sit. Move aside. Move. Don't come under it. Well done, my dear. Well done. This is called winning even after losing. Dad, today the eighth marriage proposal was rejected. I think, just like you, the 15th one will be successful.
