(dramatic music) (suspenseful music) (horse neighing) (fire crackling) (upbeat music) - [Jesse] Woo hoo! (brakes squealing) (tires squealing) (horn honking) (Jesse laughing) - Hey. (tires squealing) Jerk! (boxes crashing) - Woo! Yoo! (tires squealing) (glass shattering) (Jesse laughing) - The boy's been in one foster home after another. No wonder he's angry. I tried hard with this one. - [Woman] Nobody's blaming you, Mrs. Newell. - And nobody is listening to him. He says he likes it here. - I really need your support on this. - He's been moved around too much. He's mixed up. Jesse doesn't care about this Native repatriation thing. You don't even know who he's gonna. - They've decided he should stay with his grandfather. (horn blaring) (bicycle crashing) - [Mrs. Newell] Well, Jesse, looks like today's the big day. - I thought you said it wasn't for sure. - They got everything ironed out, all the paperwork's done. - I packed your bags, honey. Better go check I got it all. (somber music) - [Jesse] Hi, squirt. Hidin' out in my room again, eh? - I'm going with you. - You can't, Lucy. - You should have told me. - I didn't know myself. - I thought you said we were gonna run away. (Lucy crying) - Hey, I got you present. It's a compass. (trunk slamming) - Hey, Jesse. God'll look after you. - Jesse. Jesse, don't go. - Just go. - Jesse. Please. Jesse. - I know how hard this is for you. (door slamming) This is horse country. Your grandfather was a rodeo champion. - [Jesse] Spare me the fairy tale. - I'm talking about your family. - Right. My so-called grandfather spends 10 years in the slammer, gets out, does he come looking for me? No, it's some goofs in some office. - Feet off the dashboard. (motor revving) - [Woman] Let's go. - [Man] He'll come. - Hi. - I've got a present for ya. (motor revving) - I know. Hyah. (water splashing) Hyah, hyah. (woman laughing) Woo hoo. Yah. - Come on, you stupid. (hooves clopping) (engine revving) Hey Cam, what's happening? - Ladies are doing a big cook song. - What's the occasion? - Joe Moon's grandson's coming back today. Joe Moon's not exactly the greatest cook. - Man, he's a waste of skin. - I gotta go. - Wait, I've got something for you. - I can't. I gotta go. (dog barking) - I hear he's cute. - Oh yeah? Oh look who's here. Hiya, Paul. - Hey Paul, how you doing? - What's this kid's name? - Jesse Threebears. - I don't understand you helping that guy. Jim Moon and his kind nearly destroyed this place. - Don't have a hard heart. Doesn't look good on you. - He doesn't listen to anybody, except maybe you. - Don't look at me. Nobody's native enough for Paul. - [Jesse] Who'd want to live out here? - You're gonna get in touch with your traditions - Yubba dubba doo. - Jesse. - I don't buy it, okay? - I gotta get directions. (bright music) (singing in foreign language) - [Vern] (coughing) Good morning. Good afternoon. This is Va Va Vern LeBlanc coming at you live, the voice of Anishinabe Manidoo-Waaboo. This is hardly more than a horse whisper today. Guess I called one too many square dances at the Santa Ana last night. Hey, you know what? I like that theme song so much, I'm gonna play it again. What's up, buddy? - Nothin'. - It doesn't look like nothin'. Thought you were gonna give that to your girl. - She's hardly my girl. - What's bugging you? - Nothing. Got to go for a ride. (door slamming) - Hey! (soft music) - What about over here? - Oh, I was sort of saving that au natural kind of look, you know what I mean? - Well, the dirt's gonna be over there in 10 minutes. - Yeah, but everybody's got their own way of doing things, eh sweetie? - You're a good starter, Albert, but I gotta send you to finishing school. I'm looking for those bank confirmations. - In the truck. - In the truck. What's Joe Moon doing wandering around out there? His grandson's on the way, he's supposed to be home. - You know Joe. - Joe. (speaking in foreign language) Joe, I gotta talk to you. - [Albert] Save your breath there, sweetie. - He's gotta be home. - Yeah, well he's got a bad case of nerves. He figured everybody's watching. - Well, they are. - Go get him, hon. Come on. - Howdy, Joe. (speaking in foreign language) You know, Joe, you should probably be at home. I mean that young boys coming today. - I'll get there. I saw that black horse again. - Where? - The hills, back of Swan Lake. - Did he remember you? - Hard to say, he's a different horse now. - 10 years is a long time, Joe. For crying out loud, would you get in? - [Woman] What's he like? - [Ms. Falker] I think he's pretty excited. - [Woman] I need to see him. - Jesse, these ladies have been cooking for you. They're gonna show us how to get to your grandfather's. He's shy. (speaking in foreign language) - They don't even speak English. - Don't bet on it, handsome. (both laughing) (soft music) - You know, maybe I'm not ready for this. - I'll be darned. I do believe that's them comin' up our tail. - [Ms. Falker] Here we are. You've got to try, Jesse. - [Jesse] I'm sick of trying. - Lovely afternoon there, Ms. Falker. - Jesse. You can't hide from this. He's your grandfather. - Come on, Joe. He's just a kid. - Bonjour, Jesse. - Hi. - Hooey. Will you look at this rig, Joe? - I ride that bike 10 miles a day, rain or shine. - Wind out here puts them things in a ditch. (light music) - Hey, kid. Welcome home. - Joe, you gotta cheer him up. He looks so sad. And find out what he likes to eat. We'll fix it for him. - Don't worry, he doesn't bite. - I have some papers for you to sign, Mr. Moon. - Have a seat. Like some tea? - No thanks, I have to be going actually. Well, that's that, I guess, unless you have any questions. - No questions. - [Ms. Falker] My card. You can phone. - I don't have a phone. - Bye, Jesse. Good luck. - Hey, wait a sec. - It's gonna be all right, Jesse. - Give me the card. - This is a big chance, Jesse. I know you can make it work. Bye, Jesse. - Here, help yourself. (speaking in foreign language) Best meat there is. - I'm not hungry. - Then get us some water, make some tea. - I don't drink tea. - Pump's in there. (pump rattling) Got some pictures here. That's me there when I was about your age. I was riding rodeo then. - This isn't gonna work. - There's nothing to be afraid of. - I'm not scared. I gotta ride my bike 10 miles a day, every day. I'm in training. - What for? - For the big race in France. - France is a long ways from here. If you wanna do some ridin', plenty of horses here. - I hate horses. Where's the plug? - Maybe you'll find something here you don't hate. - I'm going back to the city tomorrow. - I have a horse to water. That's your bed. (dramatic music) (fire crackling) (baby crying) (birds chirping) - Stupid way to live. - This is Bearpaw. Coffee's on the stove. Two mile walk to the school bus. - I don't do school. - They teach you your traditions at school. - Is it some kind of Indian school? - Indians come from India. Anishinabe run this school. You turn right. You keep on walking until you get to Albert's store. Bus leaves at 8:30. Take my jacket. (upbeat music) (engine revving) - Jesse Threebears? You don't belong here. - Says who? - Says me. No one from that shack belongs with my people. So leave. (engine revving) - Get stuffed, Geronimo. (upbeat music) Is Grace Falker in? I have to talk to her. - You gotta do something, Vern. I mean he's gonna call that Grace woman and he wants to go back to the city. - Just keep your pants on, Albert. - I don't need this today, Vern. I got a delivery truck with $4,000 worth of dry goods coming into town and I don't have my shelves filled yet. - Albert, you're gonna give yourself a heart attack in the brain. (soft music) - No thanks. (phone slamming) - Jesse Threebears? Me and your dad were hunting buddies. - I didn't have a dad. - Did you talk to her? - No. - Look, everything will be okay. Things'll work out. - Listen, the bus is gonna leave in a couple of minutes. You better get on it. - What about my bike? - I'll take care of it. - Whoa. - What did you do last night? - [Boy] Did you watch the game last night? How was it? (engine revving) - Look, there's Paul. (horn honking) Showin' off for you, Cam. - The guy never gives up, eh? (both laughing) (soft music) (bell ringing) - Morning. Where's Jesse Threebears? - He's still on the bus. He wouldn't even look at us, Mom. - Hey, Cam. - Your number one fan. - What'd I do to deserve this? (both laughing) - Jesse, I'm Marilyn St. Claire, in charge of the native studies program. - So? It's all some stupid social worker's idea. - No, it isn't, it's our idea. The band council has been working on your case for over a year. - I'm not a case, okay? I'm not staying. - Remember that time that we were over at Tina's and the Christmas money at Palmer. - Camilla, show Jesse around. See you later, Jesse. - I'll see you later. - Hi, I'm Camilla. - I know that. - And you're Jesse Threebears, right? - I know that too. - You want to come with me over here? - Thought I told you you didn't belong here. - Get out of my face. Paul, why don't you-- - He comes from scum. - Hey, Hey. - Hey, hey, stop it. Both of you. Paul. - Paul, you stop that. I'll talk to you later. (dramatic music) - what's the matter with you? (engine revving) - Jesse. Jesse! - Well, well, well, now would you look at this people? It's a genuine miracle. Like the ghost in Hamlet, the long lost window has finally appeared. This is a great day for native broadcasting. We're finally weatherproof. (upbeat music) Hee hee, the window's here. Albert. It's your wife on the phone. Says it's an emergency. - Harvey, can't you see I'm busy here? - Jesse Threebears stole Paul's bike, he's headed this way. - (laughing) That window's a sight for sore eyes. - Stupid thing. Jesse just stole your bike. - No way. (engine revving) (upbeat music) - Jesse, Jesse! No. No! No! - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. - Jesse! (boxes crashing) Will you look at this mess? Jeez, I haven't even paid for this stuff yet. Are you nuts? - Wait a minute, Albert. The boy's hurt. - He's hurt? What about me? What about my spring merchandise? - Well what about my bike and my window? How many fingers do you see? - Two. - What are we gonna do with him? - Well, that's Joe Moon's business. Come on. - Well, it's my business too. (boxes crashing) - We go through all this trouble to try and give you something, you know, a home and a family. And then this happens. - Come on. - Come on? That's all you've gotta say to me is come on. - This is not my home and you're not my family. - Now now now, this is the res. We're all family here. (ax chopping) - You're in big trouble. - I know what you're going through. - Doubt it. - My nephew Paul was repatriated two years ago, and I've only been back a couple of years myself. There's a lot of us trying to get home. - Threebears, get over here. - Come on, let's go. Takes more than a day to get here. Give it a chance. (bike crashing) - Hey, hey. Whoa. Now son, you listen to me. I'm gonna give you the opportunity of a lifetime. I'm gonna give you a chance to pay back every cent of those damages, the dirt bike, my inventory, all of it. I want you to meet me at the stables tomorrow. I got a job for you. - Come, follow me. (soft music) Made a few mistakes in my time. I ended up in prison, maybe you heard. Got drunk, got in fights. The elders and medicine people used to come and see me in jail. That's where my healing started. (speaking in foreign language) (wood crashing) Jesse Threebears. (speaking in foreign language) She says you remind her of your great grandfather. (speaking in foreign language) Minni's one of the healers that came to me in prison. You go with her. You give her this. It's a sign of respect. Go on. - But I don't understand a word she says. - It's not about words. Go on. (speaking in foreign language) (tea pouring) - I don't drink tea. (dramatic music) (speaking in foreign language) (horse neighing) What is it? - Medicine bag. It's got a couple little pebbles in it. You carry this ground with you now, ground that's always been here, ground that's always gonna be here. It's part of your tradition. - No, thanks. - Follow me. - Where are we going? - Home. Tomorrow you got a job to do for Albert. (bright music) - She throws quite a stench, don't she? - What is it? - Well, this here is a methane digester. She turns the sludge, the night soil, the feculents, the muck, the dung, the guano into gas. Pure, environmentally friendly, cheap gas. - What planet are you from? (Joe laughing) - This here's the future. And I'm a pioneer. Start shoveling. - Cow flop tycoon. - Exactly. And until further notice, you work for me. - How much? - 3.50. - 3.50? That's nowhere near minimum wage. - All right, 3.75 tops. According to my calculations, you owe me 40 hours. You can keep track of your time on that worksheet over there. (manure squishing) I got some business over at the store, but I'll be watching. Come, Joe. - I hope you learn something from this. - What can I possibly learn from shoveling manure? - Respect horses for one thing. - Very funny. - [Albert] Come on, Joe. - While you're serving they, they might respect you more. - [Albert] Vern's waitin'. (light music) (Jesse grunting) - Ah. - Hey there. (giggling) My father's idea of career development, eh? - Your old man's the methane king? - Well, he's full of big ideas. Can I ask you something? Why'd you try to run away? - It's a hobby of mine, like sittin' in muck. - Well, it's not so bad here once you get used to it, you know? - Yeah right. - Want to watch me wash and wax my horse? (light music) - Now, I'm not saying nothing outrageous here, Vern, I'm just sayin' that we got buffalo that are overbreedin' and we've got a specialty market for buffalo meat in Japan. - Now, is that a rumor about Japan? - Well, listen, you know how much they pay for buffalo meat in Japan, Vern, they pay 40 bucks a pound. (door slamming) 40 bucks a pound. - Now, we got this for a fact. Well, well no. You know I haven't been to Japan, but I did get this from a government guy. - Oh, a government guy, (chuckling). - 40 bucks, Vern. 40 bucks a pound. - I always knew I was eatin' like a king. What for? - New fender for my stupid bike. - Can't help you out til Friday. - Listen, we gotta start getting jobs for ourselves sooner or later, and the buffalo are a resource. It's that simple. (phone ringing) - We have a caller on the line. This is Speak Your Mind. You're on the air. - It's Annie Coldchild, Albert. (speaking in foreign language) The buffalo have had a hard time. I don't think we should be trying to make money off of them. The herd is there for our kids, eh? - But what are your kids gonna do for a living when they grow up, Annie? - [Annie] I know what you're saying, but I stick to my guns. You don't exploit endangered species. - Annie, Annie, we got buffalo that are overbreedin'. They're breedin' like rats. And we gotta buy, we gotta buy, pay for the hay to feed the buffalo. And we don't have enough money for the kids for the lunch budget at the school. - Whoa, he's gone completely ballistic now, Annie, there's steam coming out of his ears. - [Annie] Good, maybe that means he's thinking for a change. (Vern laughing) - [Vern] We'll be right back with Speak Your Mind after this. - Your old man's funny when he's mad. - So's Elmer Fudd. Wanna turn off that music? Wanna give me a hand? - No, I hate horses. - Why? - They're dumb. - A horse is like a bike with a brain. (Jesse gasping) Oh, I'm sorry. - The shirt. - Yeah. My mom says you got arrested. - Who told her that? - She's on the repatriation committee. I'm an eavesdropper. And you race bikes. - Yeah, what's my favorite color? - Black. Do you race? - Used to. My bike got blown away. - Lou and I are gonna enter a big race, aren't we Lou? - Who would want to race a stupid horse? All they do is just sit there. - This one's got a big prize. 5,000 bucks. - 5,000 bucks. - Yep. You're so afraid of this horse, you won't even pat him. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. Here, you take him to his stall. - You think you've got a shot at this race? - Oh, yeah maybe. Your buddy Paul's got a pretty good run at it too. - Paul. - Yeah, y'know, the guy you wanted to fight. - Yeah, what's with him? The outfit, the attitude. - You should talk about attitude. (tense music) I don't know, Paul's on this traditional thing, thinks we should all get back to our roots. Just kind of strange coming from him, considering he spent most of his childhood growing up in foster homes in Florida. - They shipped kids off to Florida? - Yeah, kids got sent everywhere. He was pretty messed up when he got here. - If you ask me, he still is. - Maybe you two have something in common. So I guess I'll see you at school tomorrow. - School's a waste of time. - Well don't let my mother hear you say that. - Your mother? - Marilyn St. Claire, your teacher. Hey, Lou. Come out to eat? (ominous music) (Joe sniffing) - Suppose I wanted a horse, a real fast one. - What for? - There's this race. - The Yellowquill. I know a fast horse, a wild horse, win any race you want. Suppose we catch him and break him. - I don't want to learn how to ride on a wild bronc. - It's a good way. You and the horse figure it out together. - Sure, sure. Forget what I said. - Tomorrow. It's more fun with a wild horse. And I know this one real well. - No way. - I'll get it arranged. - I said no. - Better try these on. Your sneakers are really startin' to stink. (bright music) (birds chirping) - She's all gassed up. But the window on the driver's side doesn't roll up. - You're a good guy, Albert. - Jesse's gonna skip school today, honey. - Oh? - Yeah, he and Joe are gonna go up and get that black from high bank. - You're what? - The boy wants to learn how to ride. - And I've got just the horse for him. - And there is more than one way to go to school. - Well, you guys are gonna have him out there herding buffalo and we don't even know if he fits in this desk yet. - Well anyway, that's what's happenin'. - Yeah. - Well have fun. - Be careful, John, and bring that horse home, eh? - Maybe I'll go and fix Vern's window. Now there you go, honey. I mean, you asked me to get involved and then I get involved, and then you tell me to mind my own business. - Did I say that? Anyway, your business could use some minding. I better go catch the bus. (bright music) - We call this Spirit Hills. People come here to pick berries. Your mom used to like it here. Maybe you remember picking berries with her. - I was two when I left here. I don't remember anything. - That's you with the beads. She calls you (speaking in foreign language), that means partner. (speaking in foreign language) You need a hat if you're gonna wrangle horses. - I hate hats. (bright music) - I want you to know the truth about what happened to her mother. I was off getting drunk on the rodeo circuit when she was growing up. Never got to know my own daughter. It's a hard story for me to tell. - So don't tell it. Look. (horses whinnying) - That's him, the black one. - He's beautiful. - [Joe] A horse and a half. - I saw that horse before. I saw it in a dream. - [Joe] That's a good sign. - [Jesse] Why? - When you go to get your horse, it comes to you first in a dream. Two of those horses we saw in the herd were once saddle-broke. Bring the others down. Grab the feed. Oh, wait a minute. Your hat. Little bend up here, good place to rope a horse. This'll do her. Sweet feed. That'll bring them. Gotta get upwind. (pails banging) (dramatic music) - How long do we have to wait? - Lots of light left. He'll come. Want my coat? Guess it's not today. - This stinks. - What's that? - I said this stinks. (thunder crashing) - Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. We're nearly out of gas. - [Jesse] What? - I think the storm's gonna get worse. - So unbelievable. - Where are you going? - I'm gettin' outta here. - You won't even find your way to the main road. - You got a better idea? - Albert's got some gear. - [Jesse] What for? - We got shelter in the trailer. (thunder booming) - Should have known. - I got a stove here. Get back there and make some tea. - I don't drink tea. Remember? - Here comes the hail. (hail crashing) - We got a beautiful storm tonight. We're coming down to the bottom of the hour. The lines are open. Call 7271 if you have anything to say. We have a call. Good evening, who are we talking to? - [Billy] Billy Snowshoe. - Ah Billy, what's on your mind tonight? - [Albert] I'm worried about Joe and Jesse. - The horse race, Vern. - They aren't back yet. - The race is on those trails. - You got a match? - Down on Yellowquill summer land, right? - [Billy] Yeah. Well, I know no one's going down that trail or they're dancing back, eh? - Your dinner's on the stove. - What's that smell? - I'm burning some methane. - Make your point, Billy. - You're not gonna light that thing, are you? - Look, Albert knows what he's doin'. - [Billy] I don't want to go out on the land. (methane whooshing) (thunder booming) - What the? (glass shattering) Aw man, look at that, my new window. - [Billy] Still there? There's a whole lot of land on that lot. Got no idea where they are. - Correction, Billy, even as we speak, Jesse Threebears is out catching a wild horse to run the Yellowquill. Him and Joe Moon are out catching a horse in this weather. Do you believe that? Now if that ain't tough, I don't know. (switch snapping) - Hey! - Sorry. I plugged in the toaster and blew the fuse. (hail crashing) (thunder booming) - Come on. (glass cracking) - I'm a joke. Filling these tanks with methane gas and nobody wants it. - Albert, you only had four of those today. - Tryin' to run the buffalo herd like a business and everybody hates me. - Stop that. - Spent a year trying to put this stupid store together. Our bank account is down to fumes. I'm sitting here eating stupid inventory. I'm worried about Jesse and Joe. - There's gear in the truck, right? Joe can look after himself. - Well, it's just that I think maybe Joe was on pretty shaky ground right now. - They're gonna be okay, okay? (rain pouring) - Joe? - I'm in the back. Real Ojibwe boy drink tea. I know why we didn't catch the black. We didn't offer no tobacco. (dramatic music) - [Jesse] Who you talkin' to? - The creator through the horse spirit. He'll talk to the horses for us. - While you're at it, ask him for a new bike. - Dream about the horse and see. (soft music) (horse neighing) - Hi, Paul. - Cam here? I've got a book for her. - Well, she's supposed to be doing her homework. I think she's watching TV. - Vern says there's a tornado watch. - Tornados, perfect. Now I let Joe and Jesse go into a tornado to catch a horse. - Joe hasn't told Jesse the whole story yet, has he? - He doesn't know where to start. He figures the kid will never forgive him. - Cam? That book on Wounded Knee you wanted to borrow. - Yeah? Thanks. It's so wet. - Will Joe tell Jesse the truth? Tune in next week. - Stop it. - Look, if Joe doesn't tell him the truth, I will. - Paul. - It's warrior's way. You gotta look evil square in the eye. - Look, if you go sticking your nose into John Moon's business. - It's my business too. My father wouldn't have died-- - Look, I know the story, okay? But it's not your job-- - That man did it. It can never be forgiven. - Stay out of it. - And if I don't? - I don't want to talk about this anymore. I got homework to do. (somber music) - Jesse. Jesse, wake up. - What? - Shh. (tense music) It's him. (bright music) - Ooh boy. Stay back, Jesse. Stay back. Ooh. Ooh, that a boy. Ooh, easy boy. Nobody's gonna hurt you, boy. (horse neighing) Uh oh. Easy, boy. Easy, boy, easy. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa, boy. Whoa. That a boy. Nobody's gonna hurt you, boy. Bigger and stronger than we are. You have to let them know we're in control. Here, you can pet him. You came to this boy in his dream, remember? (light music) Well, how do you like him? - [Jesse] Is he really ours? - He's yours. Piece of cake, right? - Right. - Uh huh. (speaking in foreign language) Quite the storm. We were just coming out to look for you guys. The girl has been bugging me all morning. - We managed all right. - See, what'd I say? No luck, eh? - He's in the back. (horse whinnying) - Yeah? - You're kidding. - You caught the black? - Got a little rope burn right there. - What are you gonna call him? - Najif, it's Ojibwe for partner. - I know that, stupid. (dramatic music) Oh man, he's great. - You had this all worked out, didn't you? - Got lucky. Hey, sorry about your truck. (Albert laughing) - [Cam] He's gorgeous, Jesse. (horse whinnying) - What's the matter with him? He won't let me near him. - He can tell you're afraid. - He's just not into it. - No matter, go on. - I'll hold him. You put the blanket on him. - You're spookin' him. Stay back, okay? He's a wild horse. - Hardly, he used to belong to Joe. - That what was a long time ago. He's his own horse now. Just put the blanket on him. - Just give me the roll. - Stay back, okay? I know what I'm doing. - Really? You could have fooled me. - Stop! - You can't do it with words. You gotta, you gotta go to him. - [Jesse] Stupid horse. Cam? - Nevermind her, you got a job to do here. - Cam around? - She's supposed to be working. Here, give me a hand. Hey, I hear you got trouble with the black. - Nothing I can't handle. - I doubt it. - I got that new fender for Paul's bike today. It cost me $62. That'll be another 15 hours of shovelin'. - Is Camilla at home? - She's busy. You know, it seems to me that you two guys got an awful lot in common these days. Y'know, with the trainin' the horses and all. - Doubt it. (door squeaking) So, get that blanket on him? - Fat chance. - Well, you know, I could help you if you trust me. But oh yeah, I forgot, you don't trust anybody, do you? - What do you think you're doing? - I'm trying to get rid of that thing you wear. - Pardon me? - Trust me. - Why should I? - Because if you don't, if you don't trust people, then they don't trust you and you just wander around feeling all lonely and paranoid. My father's like that. He doesn't trust me, so he's tiptoeing around and checking up on me, you know? - Suppose I do trust you. Then what? - You could let me help you with Najif for starters. - Suppose you know everything about busting horses. - Yeah, Joe's taught me a few things. What? What are you looking at me like that for? - There's another carton of soup here. I've got work to do. So do you. You save that shovelin' for the barn. - So, you break that horse together? - Yeah. - Put your foot in the stirrup. Put your right hand in there. Pull it, that's it, that's it. You got it. - That's it. Now lead him around the circle. - Okay. Come on, come on, that's it. - Talk to him, Jesse. Let him know your voice. - Joe likes to play the wise old Indian. - He doesn't have to play it. He is it. - You think so? - He's half horse. - I was thinkin' half mule. So how am I doin'? - He knows when you're relaxed. Let him go it abroad, Cam. Let him do it alone. (hooves clopping) - Go, Gypsy. - Paul, no! (horse neighing) - Whoa! - [Cam] Jesse! - Hey, what do you think you're doin'? - Oh man, are you okay? - Ho, ho. - What's your problem? - You. You don't ride a horse any better than a bike. - Paul. - Heeyah. - You're crazy. - Joe. You okay? (hooves clopping) - I'm gonna kill him. - That's not our way. - Let me go! - Jesse. - We're a family here, you gotta listen to me. - Family, give me a break. - Jesse. - Let him go. He'll come back. (tense music) - What if he doesn't? Jesse. Jesse. Hey, Jesse. Jesse, I-- - I'm gettin' out of this dump. - Anybody ever tell you you get an attitude problem? - I'm famous for it. - What good's it do you? - Keeps me movin'. (soft music) - Don't leave, okay? I'm gonna be late, I gotta go. - Here, pull it over my head. Pull. Pull (grunting). You gotta put some of this liniment on my back. That's Minni's special mix. - What's with that Paul Guy anyways? Why does he hate us? - He hates me. - Why - I did some bad things, Jesse. (somber music) I spent a winter outside in Calgary once. We had a couple other drunks sleeping on cardboard. I was out on parole for stealing. I got dumped back on a reserve, hardly knew my own child. And here, she already had one of her own. Things were really bad then. So much booze. So many people lost. Your father had run off. I wanted to help your mother, but I couldn't. She died in the middle of all of that. Wasn't her fault. - Did she care about me? - tomorrow you get back on that horse. You might win that race. - Get real. - Get real. I like that. Get real. Get real, Jesse. - Can you get me ready for the Yellowquill? - Yup. If you really want it that bad. Proud of you, boy. - You're my good buddy. Okay? - Go ahead. Try the seat on. He's waiting on ya. - What's he doing? - Just testing ya. (Jesse clucking) - Whoa, whoa, whoa. (horse neighing) Whoa, whoa. - Kid's some rider. - Yee ha! (Jesse laughing) Yeah! How'd I do? - Best natural rider I've ever seen. - What are you doin' here? - Havin' breakfast with my horse. Where'd you learn how to do that? - Cowboy movies. - Oh yeah? - Go ahead, Paul. - My topic is the enemy within. - Heavy. - According to traditional teachings, the best way for us to understand about our future is to learn about our past. When I came here two years ago, I didn't know anything about my past. I've made it my business to learn. One of the things I've learned is that some people can't deal with the truth about what happened on this reservation. A lot of us came from broken homes. We got scattered to the wind and ended up far away from here. Why did things get so bad on this res? What can we do to make sure it never happens again? (dramatic music) There's some people here did terrible things and I think they should be held responsible. Our circle is only as strong as its weakest link. - Where are you going with this, Paul? - I'm saying there's evil blood in our community. And I'm looking at one of them bad apples right now. - This. - I'm not finished. - I'm afraid you are. - Just forget about him. - I'm tellin' the truth. - You can't use the circle to spread your poison. - Joe Moon killed my father. - You know that that's not what happened. It was an accident. - It's Joe Moon that should be dead. - Is that what the elders tell you? - If that's what you think, you've got a lot to understand. - I don't wanna understand. I wanna get even. - [Marilyn] Have you told them everything, Joe? - Told him what I could. - It's not just Jesse, It's Paul I'm worried about. You're gonna have to work it out with him. - Jesse. You're bouncing all over the place there. You gotta be one with him. - What do you mean? - You gotta stay with him? Let the horse carry you. - [Jesse] I don't get it. - Keep riding, you'll get it. (upbeat music) (hooves clopping) - It's funny how we learn things. Two years ago May, I came back to the res. I'd spent 10 years away doing nickel and dime jobs at radio stations in Vancouver. I completely lost touch with the land and my people. I got my paycheck, lived in a stinky little basement apartment. I had it all figured out. And then one Christmas, I got a parcel from my uncle. It was a bundle of sweet grass. Hadn't seen sweet grass since I used to collect it with my mom. But when I smelled the burnin', it was like, like I was being lifted up by somethin'. Maybe it was just my own memories of better times. Then I realized that I had completely lost touch with myself, forgotten my own story. I couldn't hear it much less tell it. I came back to the res and everything changed and all you neighbors out there, you gave me a new way of looking at myself. (crowd applauding) Well now, it's a big night for all of us. That same energy that changed me is bein' passed onto the kids on the res. And we got three of those kids in the big race tomorrow. (crowd cheering) Hold your applause until I'm all done. First off, we got Camilla St. Claire, who already won all the barrel races in the district last summer. (crowd applauding) Paul Leblanc, who already rides better than the guy who taught him, which is me. (crowd applauding) and `last but not least, Jesse Threebears, most recent arrival back to the res. One of the best riders around. (crowd applauding) Now let's hear it for these kids, these are our warriors. They're gonna win that Yellowquill race tomorrow. Now let's show 'em a good time. Okay, take it boys, sound one off. (bright music) - [Cam] Where'd you learn to do that? I think I know. - Don't you step on my foot. (Camilla laughing) - Hey! (all laughing) - Hey Jesse, can I cut in? Gotta go. - Wanna dance, Threebears? - What's your problem? I never bothered you. - Your grandfather did. He's a murderer. - What do you mean? - You don't even know, do you? - What? - So pathetic. Joe Moon got drunk and set fire to your mother's house. He burned her up and he killed my father too. - That's a lie. - Oh yeah? - [Jesse] Hey, I gotta talk to you. Did you start a fire in my mother's house? - Jesse! - [Jesse] You left her there to die? - Jesse, wait a minute. - [Camilla] Jesse, come back. - Why didn't you save her? - I was too drunk and I knocked over a lamp. Woke up outside in the ditch. (dramatic music) Look, Paul's father was there. He was the one that carried you outside. He went back in to save your mother and the roof caved in and they were both trapped in there. - You were passed out dead drunk in some ditch. (fire crackling) (baby crying) (horse neighing) I don't know where we're going, but we're going. (soft music) - Been lookin' all over for you. - This is my mother. I'm goin' out west. Out east, I dunno. I want you to come with me. - Stay for the race. At least do that for yourself. - Come on. - No, you come on. Y'know, if you really want to be with me, you'll stay for the race. (people chanting) (drum beating) (bells ringing) (horses neighing) - All contestants. - Yes! - [Announcer] The fourth annual Yellowquill Race is about to begin. (horse neighing) - Paul LeBlanc. - Don't loosen up on the rein until we get past the lower knees up. And if you feel his gait change, then stop and check his shoes. Okay? Good luck. But I'm gonna win (laughing). (speaking in foreign language) - I want you to come to the finish line with me. - He won't even talk to me anymore. I don't blame him. - You know these things take time. You're not alone, Joe. The truth can be hard. Come to the finish line. I'll wait for you in the truck. (crowd cheering) - All contestants, line up shoulder to shoulder. Keep your horses as close as possible. And keep to the marked trail. Low air in the sod can be extremely fragile. (horse neighing) Remember, all the route junctions are marked with this pink tape. If you're on a trail marked with yellow tape, stop immediately, you're in a dangerous area. The Kincaid shortcut is dangerous and definitely out of bounds. Good luck to all of you. Horses ready. Set. (gun firing) (hooves clopping) (riders whooping) - [Rider] Let's go. Ride, ride. - Hey. (upbeat music) (hooves thundering) - Double zeroes is part two. Riders, one, 14, seven, 13, two, 11. - Hyah. - Hyah, hyah. Whoo! (water splashing) Yeah! (Camilla laughing) Whoo, yeah! - Get back, Threebears. Hyah! - Hey! - [Camilla] Come on. Hyah! - Hyah! - Cut it out! - [Paul] I'm gonna kill you. Get outta here. Hyah, hyah! (crow cawing) Back off. - [Jesse] Don't, you're gonna kill us both. - [Paul] Dead meat. - Stay out. - I said back off, Threebears. - [Jesse] I'm ready, LeBlanc. - [Paul] Hey, look out! Watch it, look out! (Paul grunting) (Paul yelling) Nice work, Threebears! - Come on, let's go. Hyah. Whoa, easy boy. Well, who can't stay on his horse? - You're gonna get it. Go on, I don't need your stinkin' help. (Paul grunting) I don't need your rotten help. - Come on, just grab it. - I'm stuck. My legs are stuck. (both grunting) (ominous music) I'm sinking, hurry up. - Come on. Reach up. - [Paul] It's no use. I can't. - Come on, try. - Come on, hurry up. - Pull. Pull, come on, come on. Come on. - No! (branch snapping) (Jesse yelling) - We're gonna die, Threebears. - Help! - [Camilla] Hyah! - She's in the lead, she's in the lead! (crowd cheering) Come on, Camilla! - Oh man, he was so good through the whole thing. We had such a good time. I can't believe it. (horse neighing) (dramatic music) Where are the guys? - [Albert] They're not back yet. - [Camilla] Hey, that's Paul's horse. - Kid's on foot. I'll take the horse, double back, can you take the truck and go around the other? - All right. (tense music) (horse neighing) - Help! (crow cawing) Somebody please! - Hello. Have you seen Jesse Threebears and Paul LeBlanc? - [Man] Yeah, just a while ago. - You're sure? - Yeah, they was racin'. - Help! Somebody help! Help! - [Joe] Oh no. - [Jesse] Hurry. - Hang on, kid. (speaking in foreign language) Hold on tight. (mud squelching) Hold on tight. (boys grunting) Come on. Paul, you okay? (Paul panting) What happened here anyway? - We took a wrong turn. That's all. Right? - [Camilla] Jesse. - Joe? - Down here. (all laughing) - You guys okay? You're quite the sight. - Let's go. - Come here often? - Can you make it okay? - Come on. Oh man. Charming (giggling). - Thanks. - Thanks. - I guess we should go home and get this muck off, eh? - Oh no, you don't. You two have a race to finish. - I'm not gonna race like this. (horse neighing) Threebears, you look ridiculous on a horse (laughing). (upbeat music) - [Both] Hyah! (all cheering) - [Camilla] Hey Jesse, buckle up! - [Paul] Yee ha! - [Both] Hyah, hyah! - [Paul] Yee, hyah, hyah. (people chanting) (drum beating) (bells ringing) (upbeat music)
