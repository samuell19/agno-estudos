(UPBEAT ROCK MUSIC) (GRUNTING) Come on, this isn't over yet. You've got time. You can make it. You have to. Come on, Stacy! (SYNTH ROCK PLAYING) (BAND STOPS PLAYING) Wait, wait, wait! I'm here! I'm here, I'm here, I'm here. - (FEEDBACK DRONES) - Woah! Oh! Sorry! Sorry! I got it! (HIGH-PITCHED RINGING) You're too late, Gwen. We just finished our sound check. What? No! Come on, I made it! We still gotta check the drums. (SCOFFS) (LOOSE PERCUSSIVE RHYTHM) Gwen, this is serious. Why weren't you here? This has to stop. You're always late. You never practice. We can't rely on you. It's like you... It's like you don't want to be in the band anymore. What? Guys, please, that's not it. MELISSA: Ahem. You guys shouldn't be so hard on Gwen. It's not like you're gonna win anyway. Now, if you'd please get off my stage, it's time for some real rock stars to shine. It's just a sound check, Melissa. That's Mimi to you! As in Screaming Mimi and The Thunderbolts! (SCOFFS) Emphasis on the screaming. - (PHONE VIBRATING) - Oh, webs! Promise you'll be here tonight. Totally! Don't worry! (PHONE VIBRATING) I promise, starting tonight, I, um, I won't let you guys down anymore. All right. One, two, three, four! (SCREAMING) (SCREECHING) Tippy! No! Ow. (GRUNTS) MS. MARVEL: Hey, now! Oh, missed me! (GRUNTING) (GRUNTS) (GRUNTS) Whoops. All right, that's enough. Wait, wait, wait! I'm here! I'm here! You're too late, Gwen. (SIGHS) You know how important training is. I promised Daisy I'd keep the Secret Warriors in top shape while she and Lockjaw are on assignment for S.H.I.E.L.D. I know, I know. I'm sorry. I had this sound check, but I'm here now. Sound check? (GASPS) - You've got a gig tonight! - (TIPPY CHITTERS) You missed training for a show? Actually, it's a Battle of the Bands, and... - Oh, I am so there! - Yes, count me in! Haven't been to a good concert in forever. Hey, I'd love to go with you. (STAMMERING) I mean, I'd love to go. I've never been to a concert before, so of course I'd love to go, because I've never... Hey, it's cool. I haven't been to one either. DOREEN: Wait, what? You've never been to a concert? Like, never ever? My poor babies. We should all go! We can support Gwen and rock out at the same time! Multitasking is my favorite. (IMITATING GUITAR WAILING) (IMITATING GUITAR WAILING) (CHUCKLES) (TIPPY IMITATING GUITAR WAILING) It'll help morale. Look! Even America's excited. (PHONE VIBRATES) (SIGHS) Webs! Dry cleaning. Gotta go! - RAYSHAUN: Gwen, wait. - But what about the concert? Where is it? And when? Oh, okay! Cool! Just text me the deets then! Oh, Gwen. Good job disappointing everyone you know today. (LOUD EXPLOSION) Huh? Wha... whoa! Wha... (ALL GASPING, MURMURING) (GRUNTING) Ghost-Spider to Secret Warriors... I could use some help! (THEME MUSIC PLAYING) (SCREAMS) (GRUNTING) (ALL GASPING) (GRUNTING) Ahh! (GRUNTS) (GRUNTING) - Ahh! - Ahh! (GRUNTING) You've got this, Stacy. PATRIOT: Formation Alpha Four! MS. MARVEL: Patriot, do. Boring. (GRUNTING) Come on. We have got to work on our heroic call-to-actions! Something like, 'Watch out!' The Secret Warriors are about to become Secret Victorior... Victoriors... Yeah, okay, I'll workshop that one and get back to you. Should we even have a call to action? I mean, aren't we supposed to do things secretly? (GRUNTS) Yeah, we're pretty covert. How about this for a heroic call, "Help, please!" ♪ No matter what they say ♪ ♪ It's me and you ♪ ♪ Tell all the haters ♪ (ALL STRAINING) ♪ 'Cause we run the team ♪ ♪ Oh-oh-oh Oh-oh-oh-oh ♪ ♪ Oh-oh ♪ ♪ We run the We run the ♪ ♪ Oh-oh-oh Oh-oh-oh-oh... ♪ Okeydokey. That wasn't such a tough nut to crack. Now that that's over, we can start prepping ourselves for the concert tonight. How about we deck ourselves out in all of that sweet Emm-Jays swag! Uh, we don't have any. - Then we will make some! - MAN: What did you say? PATRIOT: Can you tell me what happened here? Huh? What? I can't hear you! I heard a loud boom right before this happened. These people were close to the source. They must have temporary hearing loss. A loud boom? (LOUD EXPLOSION) You mean like that? GHOST-SPIDER: Yup. Exactly like that. - Ironheart. - On it! IRONHEART: Whatever it is, it's... Five blocks west! Formation Delta Two! Patriot, come on! (EXASPERATEDLY) You're killing me... SG, you need to stop being such a Secret Worrier. Did you just make a pun? PATRIOT: Secure that train and evacuate civilians. Go, go, go! (GRUNTS) (GRUNTS) - No! - Ahh! Get them out! I'll catch them! (GRUNTS) Guys! IRONHEART: Almost... Almost... Done! (GRUNTS) (ALL CHEERING) Did you guys see what happened? What? I can't hear you! (SIGHS) You too, huh? (LOUDLY) Did you see anything? What? GHOST-SPIDER: They didn't see anything. Just heard the boom, and then the train went flying, and now they all have hearing loss. Just like the others. I'm sensing a pattern. If that's true, why would anyone attack a construction site and a train? I don't know, but I think something bigger's going on here. This is clearly the work of Egghead. He'll stop at nothing to see this city scrambled. Right, even though these events may look random, they must be connected. Bombs that have been planted specifically. Sorry, man, these aren't explosions. There's no fire residue anywhere. Actually, I'm not picking up any residue whatsoever. Not fire, not chemical, not even arc power. So it's an explosion you hear but don't see? Oh, I got it! It's a sonic... (LOUD EXPLOSION) (GLASS SHATTERING) (LOUD HUMMING) (METAL CRUNCHING) Grab on to something. (ALL SCREAMING) (FEEDBACK RINGING) (CHITTERING) I got you, Tippy. (CHITTERING) Ugh, my ears won't stop ringing. Yeah, and it feels like my skull is vibrating. IRONHEART: (GROANS) That was sound. We were hit by solid sound. So sound comes in green now? That's great. (SOFT GROAN) Is this what being at a concert feels like? - Rayshaun! - (YELPS) (YELLING) Are you all right? Rayshaun! (GROANS) Doreen, I'm fine. My helmet protected my ears. - You weren't so lucky, huh? - Me too! Okay... Ironheart, can you trace the green wave's origins? IRONHEART: On it. Okay, it came from the Upper East Side. Hang on. That's weird. I'm picking up similar emergency reports from Midtown and Hell's Kitchen. We're gonna need to split up. Let's go, Secret Warriors!

Can't make the show, huh? (SIGHS) Tell me about it, Dad. - (LOUDLY) What's wrong, GS? - (YELPS) Hi, it's nothing, SG. My dad's just dealing with this nonsense too, and now he's gonna miss my concert. Yeah, I hear ya! Something tells me that you don't. (PHONE RINGING) And the hits just keep coming. What? Gwen? Oh, Glory! Hey... Have you left for the concert yet? Uh, well... (STRAINING) I just missed a bus. You need to go right now. People keep talking about these huge sonic booms? I don't know, but they're everywhere, and it's so random. I'm on my fifth bus. But what if it's not random? Um, that is the opposite of what I just said. Please just leave soon. (PHONE BEEPS) - GHOST-SPIDER: Hey - What's up? (YELPS) Come on, SG. You need to wear a bell or something. - Sorry! - (GROANS) Uh, ding-ding, what's up? Ironheart, can you project a map with all the locations of these sound attacks? IRONHEART: Sure thing. What? - (CHITTERS) - Sorry! Oh, sorry. What... What... What is that? That's my concert venue. And it looks like someone's trying to cut off access to it. SQUIRREL GIRL: But why? Who would hate rock 'n' roll that much, huh? Whatever the reason, we've got one chance to stop it. Look, this is the last path still open. If we get there fast, maybe we can stop whoever's behind this. Ironheart here. We think we know where the next attack is going to be. I'm sending coordinates now. GHOST-SPIDER: Let's end this! - Yeah, let's rock! - IRONHEART: Seriously? Yeah, 'cause we're saving rock 'n'... - (CHITTERS) - Fine. Tallyho! IRONHEART: That's not better! I know the city's crazy right now. Chill. I'll get to the venue with plenty of time to spare. You guys wouldn't dare go on without me. We're Screaming Mimi and the Thunderbolts! - Hm. - (PHONE BEEPS) - Huh? - Wait. You can't go down there. Perimeter is set and clear. Keep your eyes open, Secret Warriors. Ugh, you're Avengers rejects, that's cute. Now, if you'll excuse me. GHOST-SPIDER: Mel... Uh, I mean, Screaming Mimi, stop. You know me? Wait, of course you do. I'm me. This must be great for you. Uh, yeah, so super great, but I still can't let you through. It's too dangerous. Look, I'm going to get to my concert, one way or the other. Fine, have it your way. (INHALES) GHOST-SPIDER: It's you! - (SHRIEKS LOUDLY) - It's... (GRUNTING) Ghost-Spider! - (SHRIEKS LOUDLY) - Secret Warriors... - SQUIRREL GIRL: Cover your ears, Tippy! - (CHITTERS) Take her down! ♪ Hey, hey, hey, hey ♪ ♪ Yeah ♪ (GRUNTS) ♪ No limitations ♪ ♪ Annihilation... ♪ (SHRIEKING LOUDLY) That all you got, chica? - (SCREAMS) - (SHRIEKS LOUDLY) Ooh, I'm shaking in my boots. - (INHALES) - (SHRIEKING LOUDLY) No one ever taught you how to use your inside voice, huh? Who are you supposed to be? Uh, obviously this is a squirrel tail, so if you think about it, I'm... A distraction! Embiggen! - (GRUNTS) - (SHRIEKING LOUDLY) All this chaos, and for what, Mimi? Battle of the Bands? You weren't trying to stop the concert or attack the venue. You've been trying to prevent other bands from competing against you. You mean, she's cheating? (STRAINING) (SHRIEKING LOUDLY) SQUIRREL GIRL: No! I'm doing whatever it takes to get the fame and glory I deserve. Besides, I'm saving all those pathetic wannabes from the humiliation of losing to me. GHOST-SPIDER: More like you're seriously endangering innocent people. Did you even think about that? - (GASPS) - (MIMI SHRIEKING LOUDLY) IRONHEART: Guys, Mimi's choker isn't just some cheap piece of jewelry. It's vocal amplification tech. Without that choker, she's powerless. We have to get it off her. I'm on it. (GRUNTS) (SHRIEKING LOUDLY) Oh, come on! Get out of the way! - (GRUNTS) - (SONIC WHOOSH) (LOW RUMBLING) Huh? Hm. Is that all you got, chica? (SHRIEKS) (ALL GRUNTING) (GRUNTS) (FEEDBACK SCREECHING) Well, I'm out of ideas. How are we supposed to fight sound? With sound. With something even worse than her screams, feedback. IRONHEART: If we create a loop, it could short out her choker altogether. (SLOW CLAPPING) Well, this has been fun. But I've got a battle of the bands to win. (SHRIEKING LOUDLY) Okay, that's pretty rock star. (SHRIEKING LOUDLY) (GRUNTS) (ALL GROANING) Everyone all right? (GRUNTS) We're alive, so that's something. GHOST-SPIDER: Mimi's getting away. She's headed for the concert venue. My thrusters are busted. Patriot? - (ELECTRICAL SIZZLING) - I'm grounded. (GRUNTS) I got this. (PAINED GRUNT) (GROANS) Gwen, you're the only one who can still get airborne. But that scream queen has actual wings! I only glide. I can't catch up to her. Slingshot. Mm-hmm. (ALL STRAINING) Oh, I shouldn't have had that second rhubarb horseradish donut. IRONHEART: We tweaked this gauntlet so it can absorb Mimi's screams and send the sound back to her. Her choker won't be able to handle the feedback loop and should fry itself. All you have to do is get her to scream at you. You mean be annoying? 'Cause I can do that. Guys! I think this is it. Air Ghost-Spider ready for departure. (ALL GRUNT) Come on, come on... (SLOW-MOTION GROAN) (GRUNTS) Gotcha. Get off of me. (GRUNTS) You are not getting away, you green pigeon! You pathetic super freak. You're not gonna ruin my show. The show's already over for you, Melissa. It's not Melissa. It's Screaming Mimi! (SHRIEKS LOUDLY) (GLASS CRACKS, SHATTERS) - (DEVICE WHOOSHES) - (SHRIEKING) (PAINED SCREAM) (ELECTRICITY SPUTTERS) (WAILS) GHOST-SPIDER: Everybody, buckle up. Air Ghost-Spider is going down! (SCREAMS) (ROCK MUSIC PLAYING) Have you heard from Gwen? Is she here? She's not answering. - BOTH: (SCREAMING) - (LOUD CRASH) - Oh... - What? I'm gonna feel that in the morning. And also right now. MC: (INSIDE) And that was The Thunderbolts! They played without me? No! (PAINED GROAN) Uh, stay in school, kids. MC: (INSIDE THE VENUE) Up next, the Emm-Jays! Ugh, voicemail! She's not coming, is she? I'm here. No way. - That doesn't even... How? - Knew it. I traced their descent. They should be right... Ghost... (CLEARS THROAT) uh, Gwen! Oh, I mean... (UNEASY CHUCKLE) Hi, everyone. Are we in time for the concert, or... So, this is why I'm always late. I love being in this band, and I love being a hero with the Secret Warriors. I really, really want to do both, and I'm trying so hard. But sometimes I end up disappointing everybody. Gwen, we understand. You don't have to be perfect. You just have to let us know what's going on. I know, I just didn't know how, and I didn't want to have to choose. PATRIOT: You won't have to. What makes Ghost-Spider an amazing hero is that she's Gwen Stacy. And if that means sometimes you have a gig, then we'll make that work.
