23.976 English from Closed Caption Home by Christmas (2006) Andie! Sweetheart! Time to rise and shine and face the day! Good morning. Is Andie all packed up? Almost. She doesn't leave for Spain till thanksgiving. Kids grow up so fast. Let's try to buy more gifts for the teenagers and older people. There are always so many donations for the younger ones. Oh, I got the hotel to pay the parking this year. People pay $200 a couple for a rubber-chicken dinner, and then they bitch about the five dollars for parking. Oh, I don't have time to take these clothes to the shelter. I'll take them. Make sure you lock your car doors when you go down there. Linda, are you getting rid of that red dress? -I love that dress on you! -Oh, me too. Oh, I'm sick of it. I'd take it if I were two sizes smaller. Thanks for coming around the back of the shelter to unload. I'm amazed at how many homeless women were waiting to get in out front. She's new. And too full of pride to tell her family what happened to her. I can't even imagine. Hello? Hi, honey. Again? I made you lamb. All right. Okay. I'll try to wait up. Okay. Hey. Hey. I thought you had a business dinner. I did, but we went for sushi. I had some rice. But you know I hate that raw stuff. -It's 1:00 a.m. -I know. After-dinner drinks turned into cigars. I have to do whatever I can. -Hmm. -Business has been so slow. Still? Yeah. -I'm sorry, honey. -Well... I'm exhausted. Oh, you go on up. I'll take care of this. Thanks, honey. We're still going to be able to send Andie to Spain a semester? We'll see. George, we've been saving for that for two years. I know. We'll see. Good night. Good night. I'll be right up. What is it? What's wrong? Last night I found a note in George's pocket. A note that ended in "I love you." A note I didn't write. Now I wish I'd told you. What? I'm sorry, Julie. I just... I... I don't know what to say. Say about what? People are saying that George and Donna... Donna? George doesn't even know a Donna. I don't know a Donna, except for the one at the gym. She's, like... Gena, you're crazy. What is she, like, 25? Look, maybe everyone's wrong. Everyone? Why didn't you tell me? I didn't... I didn't want it to be my fault if you got divorced. Divorced? I am not getting divorced. So guys, this friday meeting is the most important one of your lives, all right? When you show up, you have to be on your game. We can't afford to lose this one, and I'm telling you, if we make it... I need to talk to you. Sure, honey. Excuse us, will you, guys? Is everything okay? How's Andie? What.. Is it true? Is what true? Just tell me. Is it true? How much do you know? How much is there to know? Look... You know how much you and Andie mean to me. It's just that... Oh, my God, Julie, we've been together 20 years.. 21 years. Is that your excuse? Is that what makes it okay to have an affair? Huh... Hah. And embarrass me in front of from what I understand, everybody in town? I suppose Bob and Dave know. -Look.. God, where was I? -Why didn't I see it? -Please.. Oh, I guess I thought we were married. Let's try and be rational about this, okay? Andie's older now. You have your whole world set up for you with your charity stuff and your book club... I am not supposed to care that you had an affair because I belong to a book club? I'm supposed to just forgive you and everything goes back to normal? Julie... You're not understanding what I'm saying. This isn't about me being mad that you slept with a 25-year-old exercise instructor. It's about you telling me. Leaving me for a 25-year-old exercise instructor. Actually, she's 27. Julie, I'm sorry. I just... We can work this out. You're not going to split up this family because.. Come on, Julie! This hasn't been working for a long time. And you know it. I do? So, um... Mom and I decided it would be best if, um, you know, for all of us, if, um... We separated. We love you. We love you, and that will never change. Exactly. We messed up, but it has nothing to do with you, sweetheart. My team has a practice. I got to go. "We" messed up? What it comes down to is he's offering you $20,000 for your half of the present equity in the house. That includes furnishings. And what about our daughter? $500 in child support. George has also agreed to use the savings account for Andie's trip to Spain. The car's in your name, but it's not paid off. -How much is left? -12,000. You can sign this if you want, but I strongly recommend you do not give up this house. This house is a lie. Our life together was a lie. George can have the house, but I want $25,000. He pays for Andie's private track and field coach, and medical and dental till she's 21 and college for as long as she wants to go. I want it over. Now. George wants the house? He can have it. I'm going to start looking for a new place to live. Well, you're going to have to look outside of Westfield. And Julie... You should think about getting a job. $25,000 is not a lot to survive on. Are you okay, miss? Oh, I'm fine. Just a bad... day for allergies. I'm sorry to hear that. Allergies can be a pain in the ass. I have arthritis, bursitis, and every other old-person-itis, but no allergies. Go figure. Good coffee. Ah, this place was my wife Lola's idea. She likes to bake, and she wanted a place to sit and kibitz while I worked. Ay... But it turns out coffee business does better than the furniture business. Go figure. Oh, no, no, no. That's okay. It's on the house. You know, I saw a couple of pieces of furniture over there. I was wondering how much you wanted for them. Oh, so you're a customer. Well, why don't you go take a look? I'll be back in a minute. Can I help you? I'm sorry. I... I used to have an outfit just like that. Well, how deja vu for you. Well? I don't see why I have to be punished just because you and dad screwed up. You are not being punished. My parents divorce, and I'm forced to go to a new school with no track team, and live here? It's a nice place. It's just temporary until I can find a good job. I can't believe you're doing this to me. Trust me, honey, this was not my idea. I don't get it. It only has one bedroom. Yes, and I fixed it up for you. I'll sleep here. The couch folds out into a bed. Daddy told me he gave you a ton of money. Why do we have to live like this? How am I supposed to invite friends over? "Daddy"... It is just temporary, honey. And I am doing the best that I can. I will get us a new house in our old neighborhood, but it's going to take a little time. I cannot believe this is happening to me. I hate daddy! He is a stupid idiot! Oh, do not talk about your father like.. No way, mom. Well, let's give it a chance. I'll go and talk to the gym teacher and see if.. They don't even have a team. Andie, you're just going to have to be patient. Can't I live with dad until you get it figured out? No! Go and live with daddy? How could you even suggest.. Fine! Andie... I have to get to class. If I don't get there on time, I don't get a desk. I have to sit on the floor. I have to say, you're very brave to be out in the world on your own. I can't imagine starting over. At least you have money. George may have been a snake, but I'm sure he left you comfortable. Oh, yes. Now, why are we here? Do you have a new house you want me to transform? No, actually, I'm looking for a job. I thought maybe I could help you out in the store or with clients in their houses. You know, you always said I had a flair for color and design. Remember? Absolutely. Um... I wish I could help, but I don't make enough right now to pay an extra person. Um.. I'm sorry. Oh... Ha! It is late. The wine made me forget my schedule. Look, I've got to run. Uh, do you have this? Oh, sure. You're a doll. Good to see you. Mom! I need new gym clothes and a new backpack. This backpack is red, and red apparently is a gang color. Red's not allowed in school. Yeah! They banned an actual color! What if you're born with red hair? Can they make you shave your hair off? Oh, yeah. And a kid got arrested in my class today because he brought a knife to school. You're kidding. No, I just thought you should know what I'm dealing with. I'm sorry, honey. I am doing the best I can. Mom, I have no friends. The girls think I'm a snob and the boys think I'm a prude. Okay, there has got to be a job somewhere. Merry Christmas. Which package would you like to buy? Oh, they're all so beautiful. So how's the furniture working out? It's wonderful. thanks. You know, these are the best muffins. There's something special in here but I don't know what it is. My wife's recipe. You know, she wouldn't give me the recipe till I promised to take it to the grave. I never see her in here. Oh, she died ten years ago. Oh, I'm sorry. You talk about her, so I just... Well, to me, she's still here. Go figure. Oh. She smells rich. Does she look like a shopper? I think she looks like a shopper. Hi. I'm Julie. -Hi. -I see you here almost every day. Do you work nearby? I'm the bank manager at Calicom Bank. I handle most of their real estate transactions.. Mortgages, loans, that sort of thing. Oh, I bank there. Or used to, at the Westfield branch. Christmas job? Oh, my daughter's in high school. I just thought I'd keep myself busy. Ah. Well, good for you. Do you have this dress in your closet? No. Merry Christmas. Mountain Gate photo. What kind of an emergency? Is she okay? What's going on? Are you all right? Julie, please, sit down. I know how awkward this is, but Andie came in to see me yesterday and asked my help in putting together this meeting. It seems she's really unhappy at her new school, and... Yes, but... She knows it's only temporary. She wants to come back here, to Mountain Gate. She misses her friends and she wants to continue to compete on the track team. Yes, I know that, but... Excuse me. Why is she here? Julie, I thought it would be best to deal with this right from the beginning, now that Donna and I are living together. If Andie comes to live with me, Donna will be part of her life, and I thought it would be best for all of us to deal with this, you know, right from the beginning. Andie is not going to come live with you. Of course it's your choice, Julie, but I've spent some time talking with Andie, and she's very uncomfortable with her new surroundings. I thought maybe there could be some way we could work it out. Maybe she could spend weekdays with her dad... And... Only till thanksgiving. And then she goes to Spain, and by the time she gets back, maybe you'll be more settled. We can have dinner every night, mom, and on weekends, we can do whatever you want. I want you to know, I'm very dedicated to Andie, and I want what's best for her.. Please, don't speak to me. Please, mom. I really want to go home. Mom! Mom! Mom, I'm sorry. Look, I know I've been horrible. I never realized how hard this was on you. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's hard for me to think of you as a real person and not just my mom, but I know this has been really hard on you, too. I just love you. I love you, princess. I just love you, that's all. I love you, too. -I'll see you friday? -Yep. I will pick you up right here. Okay. Want to get chinese and go for a movie? -Of course. Yep. -Okay. -Okay. Love you. -I love you, too. -Bye. -Bye. Okay, bye. Slow day? I sold a chair this morning. I got so excited, I almost had a heart attack. You know, you have great stuff. Beautiful pieces. Maybe it's not displayed properly. I'll tell you what.. Why don't you hang up that "closed" sign, and we will fix up the place. I don't have money to pay you. Okay, I'll make you a deal. I get free coffee and muffins for a week. Make it a month, and you're in business. -Done. -Okay. Oh, I'm sorry. We're closed right now. Is Max all right? He never closes. He doesn't believe in it. Uh, we're doing inventory. But I just put two quarters in the parking meter. There, that ought to cover your losses. You know, I was going to have a coffee and a muffin, too. There you go. Is this decaf? Is the free coffee decaf? Yeah. If you knew Max, you would know that Max does not believe in decaf. Can I ask you, um... Who you are? I'm Max's girlfriend. Well, good for him. Is this really my store? Display is everything. Everything okay, Max? My son was supposed to come by and give me a lift home. My car's in the shop. Uh... I'll give you a lift. Um... Oh. Thanks. Any chance your son doesn't drive a convertible? Huh? Oh, I really miss your cooking, mom. Donna cannot cook at all. She's a vegan, so we all have to be vegans. I mean, give me a break. What the hell is "tofurky"? Well, save room for dessert. I made pumpkin pie. What? Well, I sort of promised Donna and dad that I would have dinner here and dessert with them. Oh, okay. Well, I'll just take you over when we're finished and pick you up in the morning. Well, dad's driving me to the airport in the morning. Oh. I bought you a few new things to pack. -Hmm. -Thanks, mom. Christmas, you'll be in Spain. I guess we'll just have to look forward to the summer together. I'll miss you. I love you. I'm going to miss you. I love you, too. -Love you. -I love you, too. I'll see you when I get back. -Yes. -Okay. -Bye. -Bye. No! No! It has everything in it! Leave her alone! Good news! The doctor says you might be able to get out of here tomorrow. Oh, good. Was there someone here to see me? I sort of remember a woman... A woman brought your purse in. She said she found it in the alley, near where you were attacked. It had your I.D. and your car keys in it. All my Christmas money was in there. Checks, credit cards... You're lucky to be alive. Merry Christmas for that, huh? Thank you. I didn't realize I don't have health insurance. I was recently divorced, and my husband handled all those sorts of things. Well, you were brought in as a Jane doe without any I.D., so the first day, you were here as an indigent. The hospital can look the other way on those charges, but you still owe $6,000 in hospital fees. Six... Thousand... Well, I can't give it to you all at once. Could I just write a check for $500, and pay it off? Oh... My checkbooks were stolen. The bank says there's no money in your account. Wh.. That's not possible. I... I have at least $15,000 in that account. You'd better talk to the bank. They're saying you cleaned that account out a couple of days ago. Ah, that's impossible. I was here a couple of days ago. I... Oh, my God. He must have gone to the bank before I canceled my cards. We'll make up a bill and mail it to you together with a payment plan. This was on my door, and my key doesn't work. When the rent's over a week late, that's what happens. I was two days late. And then I was in the hospital. I was mugged. Can you pay it now? Well, no.. No rent money, no apartment. I have nowhere to go. Sorry, lady. That's not my problem. Please don't do this. I'm sorry, lady. Hi. George? Listen, I was... I.. I.. Well, no... No, I didn't get a message. I've been... I have a terrible.. Married? Well... Well, congratulations. Uh... Did you tell Andie yet? Well, that's probably a good idea. No... I'm fine. I... That's my skirt. -Hi there. -Hi. Hi. Oh. Hi. You sell real estate? I thought you worked in a bank. And I thought you were married and lived in Westfield. It turns out you sleep in your car. No, I don't. I know, because I saw you there last night. I also live in my car. Going on a year now. It was you. You found my purse and came to see me at the hospital. Mm-hmm. I'm glad you're okay. Thank you. He took all my money and cleaned out my bank account. That's why I was sleeping in my car. Just for the one night, until I get the bank to work out.. The bank has a responsibility to look into the matter immediately. They gave me some papers to fill out. Of course they did. Did you follow me here? Mm-hmm. I was curious, and... That's my skirt you're wearing. Oh, well... Fits nice. Best purchase I ever made. Two dollars at the thrift shop. -What? -Mm-hmm. I paid $150 for that skirt. You paid $150 for this skirt, and you sleep in your car? Good Lord, what is this world coming to? No, I told you, that was for one night. I fully intend to work out my financial situation and... Yeah, well, good luck with that. But you might be entitled to some unemployment benefits or welfare. You know, there all sorts of services out there. It'll never come to that, but... Thank you. Right. Well... If you need my help, you know where to find me. You should eat before you leave. Number 112? You didn't work at your recent employment long enough to qualify for unemployment benefits. You may qualify for welfare. Fill these out and mail them to the address on the back, and you'll be called in for an evaluation. Tax returns for the past three years? My ex-husband has all of these, and I can't let him know that... Look, all I need is a little help for a short while. I'll pay it all back with interest. I'm sorry. It doesn't work that way. Number 113? I've been waiting for two and a half hours. It's a slow day. Julie? Julie? Hi. How are you? Great. Wonderful. Best day ever. Look, I just thought I'd see if everything was okay. How nice. Look, if things didn't go so well for you in there, Julie, it's all good. Look, you have been really nice, but you cannot help me. I want... A hot shower... -..and a nap. -Mm-hmm. And I really need to get my hair done. Have a seat right here, darling. I'll be right back. How am I going to afford this? Oh, look, every tuesday and thursday between 3:00 and 6:30 the salon needs to have people volunteer. One time, I got a cut, a color, and a style for free. Okay. What happened to your hair, darling? There's no life. ? The Lord is come ? Let earth receive her king ? Let every heart... A couple of nights, I stay at the shelter downtown. The other nights, I sleep in my car. Of course, you've got to know where to park to keep the cops off your tail. I will make you a list of some of the best parking spots in town. Oh, I won't need that. I'll be fine. This is not who I am. I've shopped in all these stores. -I've eaten in these restaurants. -Oh, okay. All right, so this is me? You think that maybe I make a better homeless person? -Oh, no. -You know, I went to U.C.L.A. No, that's not what I meant.. Julie, I don't think you realize just how many women are in our shoes. ? It came upon a midnight clear ? That glorious song of old... I met George in my sophomore year in college. We were both taking the same classes. We were married by the time we were seniors. He went to law school, I supported us. He loved to say he'd be taking care of me for the next 60 years. Oh, my God. So let me get this straight. You put this guy through law school, bore and raised his daughter, gave him the best years of your life, and he up and he leaves you for some skinny-ass bimbo? -Mm-hmm. -My God, what a pig. What happened? I mean, if you don't mind me asking. No. No, not at all. Oh, girl, I got fired when the stock market took a nosedive. So, every couple of months, I apply at all the banks, and I wait to see what happens. But thanks to you and all your girls for donating your clothes, I'm looking fine. Yes, you are. And I got to tell you something. I love these, but my God, are they fattening. You've got a great figure. I worked out three times a week. I never looked that tight. Well, I got to tell you, it's the stairs. It's a free workout, but it is brutal. It will kick your butt, and it will hand it to you on a platter. The stairs? Don't ask unless you're serious. Forget the thigh master and the butt buster. This works better. -You ready? -Yeah. Leave me to die. Save yourself. Girl, it took me three weeks to get up to the top without taking a break. Keep going, and I will meet you at the bottom. Oh, I hate George Bedford. I hate... George Bedford. Oh, my God! George Bedford? George... George Bedford, Commercial Plus? I just put it together. You were married to George Bedford? I used to do all of his long-term tenant deals. Girl, he has tons of money. Why are you broke? Well, if he has it, he hid it. Ah... I signed an agreement. He sent me $500 last month, before Andie left. It's probably in my mail box. Except I don't have a mail box or an address anymore. Yes, you do. I'll just add your name to the P.O. box, and all your mail from the apartment will be forwarded here. Great. Julie! Where have you been? -Ah... -Do you see what you did? I am so glad. Good for you! What can I get you? Excuse me? -Sorry, too busy to talk. -Sir? Help yourself. I am so sorry. I did not know who you were. What you've done for this place, it's amazing. My dad looks better than I've seen him in years. Thank you. He's a great guy. He must have been a great dad. He was. Is. So, do you work around here? My dad says... Oh, I used to. Um, I'm taking a break. A vacation of sorts. But you live around here? Sort of. Michael! Come help me schlep this armoire. -I got to schlep. -M-hmm. Wait here. I want to talk to you some more. I figure if I ask you enough questions, I'll figure out if you're married or have a boyfriend or are secretly dating my dad, like you said, which leaves me out altogether. You're very sweet. I'm not married. But yes, I do hold a secret torch for your dad. I knew it. He gets all the good women. Go figure. Um, you'll wait, right? And things are going to get even better. Why is this house still for sale? Oh, this house is what we call a "white elephant". The owners live overseas. They want 1.5 for the house. It's only worth 800,000. They won't budge. Meanwhile, I have to sit here sunday after sunday showing the place. I'm missing my son's soccer games and I have no time to do my Christmas shopping. I'm Selma James. -Hi. -And this is Julie Bedford. We have our own company, home sweet home. We would be happy to sit on it sundays for you. If we get the asking price, we'll split the commission with you. If we get less, you take the commission. -Really? -Mm-hmm. Oh. That would be so great. Home sweet home? I've never heard of you. Well, we're a new company. We are always on the move. We practically live in our cars. Well, great. The lock box is in the garage and, uh, I'll let my boss, Rita Jones, know. That is the combination. And here's my number, if you need anything. Our business cards are being printed up. Okay. Thank you. Oh, excuse me. Hi. Ha! What? -What? -Why did you do that? Well, because now you have a place to stay on saturday nights. Look, you sleep here, and on sundays you can hang out and show the place. But I'm not a licensed agent. Oh, so get your license. Look, you study a couple of books, you take a test. It's not like you got to go to school. All the books you need are in the library. It's not like you ain't got nothing to do. Good advice. Thank you. I'm always full of advice. Well, you might want to keep some of that advice for yourself. Huh? You are smart, educated... You have held down an important job. Why are you sitting around, waiting for some bank to rehire you? There are so many other things that you could do. Really? Yes. Well, then, maybe I will. We could start home sweet home. I'll sell the houses. You handle the loans and financing. Look at you, with all your fancy advice. Hi. Yes, I was wondering if you have the books one studies to get ready for the real estate license exam. Women are the ones that do the home buying. In all my years of running this business, that is one thing that I have learned. That, and that buying a house is an emotional experience. I mean, a woman might buy a house because she likes the wallpaper in the kitchen or she likes the curtains in the bathroom. Or sometimes she just likes the way it feels when she walks through the door. You know, that's why some agents bake an apple pie or chocolate chip cookies when they're showing a house. Ah. Comfort. Comfort sells. Yeah. I knew this one agent who used to bring her kids and let them swing on the swing sets in the back yard of the houses that she was showing. She would have them whistling something. Where have you been? It's been so long. I've been really busy. Julie, what did you do to my son? Hmm? He's been asking about you every day. "Did she come in today?" "Did she ask about me?" Tell me you'll have dinner with the boy and put him out of his misery. Oh... I am not really dating right now. Julie, do an old man a favor. Please have dinner with the boy. If he chews with his mouth open, I'll beat him with a stick. I suppose I could have one dinner. Give me your address, and he'll pick you up at 8:00. Oh. Um... Tell you what.. Tell him to meet me at Luigi's at 8:00. Grace? The boxes of clothes that I brought in a couple of months ago, are they gone? Well, we send them out to shelters all over the town, but there are still some boxes left. Yes! Yes! I think there were shoes. I was thinking maybe a french braid? Something really.. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. French braid, no. I hate that. I'm going to give you something kick-ass. Wow. You look beautiful. I didn't think you'd come. Well, you're here. I'm thinking about leaving. I'm not sure I'm ready for this. Okay, I'll make you a deal. We sit. I buy you dinner. We don't say a word. When dinner's over, we go our separate ways. What are you doing? Are you balancing your checkbook? Well, I figured, since we're not going to speak... I'm sorry. It's just... I have absolutely nothing to say. It's okay. I'm recently divorced from a man I believed I would spend the rest of my life with. I have a daughter, who is away at school in Spain, and the holidays are coming, and I felt lonely and vulnerable, and you seemed like a nice man. I'm sorry. I probably shouldn't have told you all that. It's just that I haven't been on a date in 23 years. Which is, incidentally, close to the age of the woman my husband left me for and just recently became engaged to. And now I have ruined your dinner. I.. I should leave. No, no, no. Don't leave. It usually takes six dates and 12 bottles of wine before a woman will be that honest with me. Please. Okay. So, yes, I followed my dad's advice and I went to medical school. And you never got married? Oh, I was engaged once. Uh, she died in a car accident. Oh... I'm sorry. Um... I buried myself in my work. Now everybody I know wants to set me up on a date, and I know by the first course I'm not interested. -So we must be doing okay? -Yes. I want to see you again. Give me your number. Oh, um... I'll give you mine. This is my business card. And this... is my home number. I thought doctors didn't give out their home phone numbers. We don't. Unless it's an absolute emergency. That's the sweetest thing anyone's ever said to me. Um, my father asked me to be a gentleman and not to kiss you on our first date. More good advice. I don't want to go home right now. Where do we go? Actually, there is someplace that I'm supposed to be. ? A Christmas dance with you ? I can't remember... Oh, my God! You look so beautiful! Where have you been? We have been trying to get in touch with you for months! You dropped out of sight. You look so great! I heard you went to Hawaii with the pool boy. Oh, no, I've been here, but... I brought a friend. Is that all right? Are you kidding? She put this whole thing together. It's your party. I used to have a dress just like that. Really? How d?j? vu for you. This is Dr. Michael Stern. This is Gena. -Nice to meet you. -Linda. Nice to meet you. George is here. With Donna. Oh, I didn't think he'd come with... My ex-husband is here. Let's dance. Excuse us, ladies. Of course. Wow. ? I can't remember a feeling like this ? Such heavenly bliss ? Intoxicated by your kiss... My mother tried to teach me how to dance. She thought I'd be the President of the United States, she wanted me to be able to dance at the inaugural ball. Unfortunately, I just wanted to join the circus. Oh, smart woman, your mother. Mm-hmm. ? And the glistening snow has fallen ? Sleigh bells keep a perfect rhythm for ? A Christmas dance... Whoa, whoa, whoa. Julie? -Hi. -Hi, George. How are you? Wow, you look really great. Thank you. This is my friend, Dr. Michael Stern. You did me! I'm sorry? Uh, you set my foot after I broke it skiing last year. I was your patient. So many patients come through my office. -I don't remember. -It's okay. Excuse us. That's our song. They have a song? Why don't we have a song? "You did me"? We have a song? ? Life can be so sweet ? Love can be so fine ? I know I'm complete ? When I hold your hand in mine ? Try to picture this ? You and I embrace ? Share a tender kiss ? As we stand there face to face ? I believe in fate ? I believe in chance ? I believe there's music playing ? So let's dance I Love our song. ? Sweeter than a dream... I Feel like Cinderella. ? Sorry if it seems ? That I care a bit too much Thank you for tonight. This was the best date I've been on. Ever. Yeah, as dates go, this was... This was right up there with Emily Rogers. Trust me, I was 13, and Emily was very friendly. Oh, look. That's the North Star. That's the star Santa uses to navigate through the world on Christmas Eve. Aw, you still believe in Santa? I believe in the magic of Santa. Okay. When I was a little, there was always a special Christmas present under the tree. Something that no one could account for. My mom and dad said they hadn't bought it. And it was always something I wanted more than anything else in the world. Something I hadn't even told my parents I wanted. One year, I opened up this little box, and there was a gold locket inside, just like the one my mom wore. I think I was eight, and it was a grown-up, big girl necklace. And on the back, it said, "For sweet Julie". It meant so much to me that I put it on and I never took it off. Ah... That's nice. I better go. Thanks. Call me. Oh, yeah. Ooh. My coach just turned back into a pumpkin. Yes! Yes! So, what did you tell him? Nothing. I obviously can't ever see him again. What? Why not? He sounds great. Yeah, and one of the things he said he liked about me was that I was so honest. What am I supposed to say? "Oops, I forgot to mention that I'm homeless and I sleep in my car at night and eat free mall food during the day." Well, you don't have to tell him everything. Save a little. I don't have time for a relationship anyway. I finally got a plan. I take the real estate licensing exam on tuesday... -Mm-hmm. -..and then I can get a great job and crawl out of this hole I've been in, and by the time Andie comes home for summer, I'll have my life back, and she'll never know about this sad chapter. Did you hear from the bank? Mm-hmm. They're still working on it. It's from Andie. What? What? What is it? She's decided to come home and stay with me for Christmas. I cannot tell her I am homeless. I don't want to burden her. Oh, come on, now, girl. She loves you. She'll be fine. I think I should just call her and tell her not to come home. I don't know what else to do. Well, I'll tell you what. Why don't you come with me to church? I always feel better after church. I haven't been to church in months. You know what? You'll fit right on in. Come on. ? Amen ? Amen ? Amen ? Amen, Amen Hallelujah! ? Amen Whoo! ? Amen ? Amen ? Amen, Amen ? Amen ? Amen ? Amen ? Amen, Amen Oh, that was the most beautiful music I have ever heard in my life. Well, now you know why I feel better after church. We run on the community communism theory. Communism theory? They can't do that. You turn around and you tell them you're going to take them to small claims court if they even think about trying to cut off your heat. I made a deposit on a friday and didn't write my rent check until monday, and still it bounced. As long as you made your deposit before 4:00 on friday, the bank has a responsibility to cover any checks you wrote after monday. Oh, and you tell them not only are you not going to pay the overdraft fee, but you want a letter sent to your landlord explaining that it was the bank's mistake. You're right about church. I do feel better. Well, that's what church is all about. -Hi. -Hey. Hmm. I saw the sign out front. You're here. You are dedicated. It's sunday. It's also three days before Christmas. No one is looking for a house right now. Close it up. We'll show it again after the first of the year. Okay. Well, I'm leaving in the morning to have Christmas in Washington with my parents. What are you going to do? My daughter's coming in to see me, -..to stay with me. -Good. Well, that sounds like fun. -I'll see you when I get back. -Mm-hmm. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas, Madeleine. "Large, warm house..." "Wonderful yard." "Perfect for the family." A family of ghosts, maybe. Ho, ho, ho, ho! I believe in you. Ho, ho, ho! Max. I need a favor. You broke my son's heart. You know that, right? He mopes around like a lost puppy. I'm sorry. And I will make it up to him one day. I promise. Listen, I need to borrow a couple of things for just a couple of days. Whatever you want. Oh. I just moved into a new house and the furniture won't arrive for two weeks. My daughter's coming for the holidays, so I need two beds and a table and chairs and a couch... If it's not too much trouble. And the other thing is I need it tomorrow. Give me the address. Thank you, Max. Is that for me? If it isn't, it's not polite to flaunt it. Oh, Julie... Thank you for this. I'm coming, Max! Michael. Uh, I told Max I'd drop this stuff off to you. Well... I was just on my way to the airport to pick up my daughter. Well, I won't keep you. You never called. I meant to. I guess I just got so busy with the holidays... Right. My daughter's coming for Christmas. So I have to run some errands and spend most of the day at the airport. I understand. Okay, well, I'll just bring that stuff in, then. -Okay. -All right. I.. I really appreciate it. Let's make this quick, guys. Well, that's it. Thank you. Thank Max for me. I will. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. I like you. I like you. I think you're a wonderful man, so I'm going to tell you the truth. I am a liar! My husband left me with very little money, and I was so determined to make a good life for my daughter and myself, but the school didn't have a track team, and the kids were smoking, and there were gunshots, and then I got mugged, and I couldn't pay the hospital bill because the muggers had two forms of I.D. the manager locked me out of my apartment and I lost my job, so I ended up living in my car and eating free cheese at the mall. And I was making it work, but then my daughter told me she was coming home for Christmas, and this house is an elephant that nobody was going to buy over the holidays, and so I just thought I would live here for a few days and pretend that my life was working. I pawned all my jewelry at the pawn shop, and I bought Christmas presents, and I made a special dinner. And I don't blame you if you hate me right now, but if you don't, I would like to invite you to Christmas dinner and I would like you to bring your dad, and if you don't, I completely understand. I have to leave now and go to the airport. Wow. Hi! I've never been so happy to see anyone in my life! -Oh, mom, I love your hair! -Oh, you do? -Yes! -Oh, no. I love it. Okay, okay, tell me everything! Okay, well, forget TV, because everything's in spanish, except reruns of Gilligan's Island, which are in french. I don't even care if we live in that apartment. I'm just so happy to see you! Oh, baby, I moved into a new house. I mean, I don't have much furniture in it yet, I'm just in the beginning stages of putting it together. Okay. -Okay. -Let's go, let's go! Mom, it's beautiful! -We live here? -Yes. -Michael. -What? Nothing. Wow! Mom, this is beautiful. I like it way more than our old house. You must be doing so great. I'm doing okay. Oh! I want to see upstairs! Me too. Remember that Christmas when I stayed up all night long waiting for Santa, and then I was too tired to open my presents until the next day? Of course I do. I was the one trying to get you to go to sleep all night. Oh, and remember that Christmas when dad dressed up as Santa and he got caught in the chimney? Oh, yes. I'm sorry. Oh. Honey... Our futures are what we make of them, but our past, our memories, are set in stone. Your father and I had many wonderful years together, and I would not trade one moment of watching you grow up. Okay? Oh... Who's that? Oh, I invited some friends. What kind of friends? -Just a friend and his father. -Mmm. -Oh, my God. -Hello, Julie. You got the message I left for Madeleine. I am so glad. I'm sorry. I hate to have to bother you on Christmas Eve, but the Bloomfelds are only in town for one day, and they just had to see this house. They're having their sixth baby. They need a big house. -Well, come on in. -Uh-huh. Come. This is my daughter, Andie, and this is Rita Jones and the Bloomfelds. Hi. Please, don't, um... Don't let us disturb you. Who are they? And what are they doing here? That's what I was going to tell you. My new career is in real estate, and, uh, I... Redesign houses and show them to prospective buyers. I found there was a real market to, you know, fix up these empty houses and make them look homey in order for them to sell. This is one of my... Model houses. Yup. Mom... I am so proud of you. That's brilliant. You are a genius. Fruit salad? Julie? May I speak to you for a moment? Yeah. I can't believe you did this. I can explain. In all the years that I have been selling houses, I have never once seen a real estate agent go to such lengths to sell a house. I mean, this is so beyond baking apple pie and whistling, swinging children. They want the house and all the furniture! They offered me the asking price, plus whatever it cost for the interiors to do. -Really? -Yeah. -I'm amazed! -Yeah! So after the 1st, we'll sit down, and we'll finalize contracts. They're pre-approved. This should move very quickly. Oh! Good. I'm just... I'm just so impressed. I want you to redecorate all of our empty houses. We'll pay you to redo them. Plus... There's your sales commission on top of that. Okay. And the kid. What a great touch. Where'd you get her? She just... Flew in. Well... Merry Christmas, Julie. Merry Christmas, Rita. Bye. -Bye. -Bloomfelds! Well, congratulations. Thank you. You like it? Yes. I thought it would go with your gray cords. Oh, thank you, mom. Oh, this is the best Christmas. Spending it with my beautiful, grown-up daughter. Hey, I'm going out with my friends later. -You want to come with me? -Oh, no, thanks. I have some friends that I need to see. Okay. And this one. Well, I'm out of here. -Oh, you look great. -Thank you. All right, honey. -Okay, I'll see you later. -All right. Be safe. All right. Bye. Oh! Oh! Yes, I'm trying to reach a Dr. Michael Stern. Yes, yes, I know it is Christmas, but this is his emergency number, and it's an emergency. His father? Why? What's wrong? Which hospital? Okay. Thank you. Excuse me. -Do you have a Max Stern here? -Let me have a look. He's in room seven. That's the second door down the hall. You can't just do something simply because you want it. I'm perfectly capable of walking. Who's the father here, and who's the son? You're okay! Julie... -Oh! -Good to see you. How did you know where to find me, hm? I get indigestion, and my son, the brilliant doctor, thinks I'm having a heart attack. Go figure. It's better to be safe than sorry. My dad is a very stubborn man. Thank you. Thank you for everything. How did that all work out? It was wonderful. Oh, good. Where's your daughter? Oh, she went out with some friends, so I... Well, that's perfect. Come on. I'll take you out to dinner with my dad. Nah, nah. No, thank you, Dr. Know-it-all. I'm going home for some peace and quiet and I'm going to talk with your mother. No, I am not senile. I know she's not there, but I still talk, and she listens. Unlike you, with your thick head. What you did for me was so special. How did you find my necklace? I don't know what you're talking about. You're Santa. That is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. Come on, it's Christmas. What are we going to do? I have a great idea. When was the last time you went to church? ? Joy to the world ? The Lord is come ? Let earth receive her king ? Let every heart prepare him room ? And Heaven and nature sing ? And Heaven, and Heaven ? And nature sing Hello! -Merry Christmas! -Merry Christmas! Oh, Selma... This is Michael. Well, hello. Nice to meet you. You have your daddy's eyes. Well, thank you. I've been looking for you. I have some mail for you. Here you go. So, did you enjoy it? Oh, they're amazing. Really. What? What? I passed the real estate exam! -I did it! -Good, Julie! Now we can start home sweet home. I think maybe we can help you. Well, it is Christmas Eve, so you should expect miracles. All right, let me just put you through to our financial advisor, and we'll see if maybe we can get you pre-qualified. Okay, I'm just going to put you on hold. Hello? Merry Christmas. May I help you? -Hey, mom. Ready to go? -Hey, honey. -Just one minute. -Okay. Where is she going? Home... For the holidays. lowercase made ? 14.11.2019
