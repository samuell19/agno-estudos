Very limited information that we have at this point. But they say that a confidential informant was shot and killed here at this pool home for what they're saying, a deal gone bad. According to detectives, they say that they have reason to believe the shooting may be connected to an auto repair shop. That's expecting to get a large shipment of guns. But at this point they're still trying to confirm all of that information. They're talking to witnesses and they're also talking to neighbors to see exactly what they have heard or seen.

Mark is this is tip. Give me a call. Okay. I know you're ready to make the drop, but we just finished doing an account. So hit me up. Bye. That's all. I think we need to talk. You've been lying to me since we've met and I need to know if you know these people. The only reason I lie to you because I don't want you judging me for what I'm into. So is your real name Demarcus Tyler. Yeah. All right. Did you kill the informant? I sure. All right, Marcus, in order for me to help you, you have to be honest with me. So did you shoot him? I shoot. Katie know who shot him? Yeah. Do we know where the gun is? I don't know what is on that. Okay. I have to know the truth so that I can help you. Do you know where the gun is? Okay. Let me think. I think I have an idea, but I'm going to have to have you wear a wire. I know I'm to window wild. What you talking about in order for me to get you out of this, you need to make your why, you know what you're talking about? You know, the people I work with, I'm not wearing a wire. But you have to understand if we don't have a gun, we have to have something else to cover your tracks. So if you wear the wire, we can get you guys talking about business from the shop and I can switch that out, but you have to wear a wire. That's my only other option. So if I wait while all is, well, all of you are, if you wear the wire, all of you are you all lock girls? What am I going to do? Paula markers. So if Brian to say what? Under the in the rest of the money. Almost us less, bro. What about the gloves? Knows the histories better on this. Okay. Okay. So how are you doing at this point? I'm just trying to help his legacy to live on it. And then that got to do something. We can't go on like this forever, but I definitely have some people that's going to help us out or whatever. I got like 150 people say, they'll come out to the rally. That's a good start. We need to figure out a really good plan and execute the case. I mean, if nobody else is gonna take action and stop this, we do just the beginning of this year. We've had 40 deaths by us. Wow. Did you catch the news last week? The little two year old gun down on her porch. Good John. So heartbreaking. It really hit home. When you have a son, like you just you'd be so scared for them. Like you don't know how stuff's going to go. When they get older, these boys hopping off the porch at 10, 11 years old, they going to the park plan, but they feel like they gotta be strapped. The play grading sheet terrifies me having a son. And like, I don't know what his life going to be. He can't do this. No more girl. We gotta do something. Yeah. It's just getting worse and worse. Nobody is going to stop this. We need to somebody, I guess it's going to have to be us. So let's get started. Right here being patient. You can't literally commit right here. Location. Get the money to go. Make sure he'll be ready for the truck. His last man, all over the city right now. Want to cry. We're here downtown. Where a group of protesters have gathered speaking out about the gun violence in the city. The mayor says that he will take a second. Look at the current gun laws. If petitioners can gather 100,000 signatures, both the city officials and law enforcers are greed that the gun violence in the city is rising. So something has got to be done. We're talking with some organizers actually about why they are here. Why aren't you protesting today? Well, I wanted to do something great for the community. We've been having a lot of killings and a lot of gun violence going on. My father was also a victim of gun violence and I just want to do something to pay tribute to him. And man, how is this personal for you? I just lost my boyfriend a couple of weeks ago, due to a straight bully. I wouldn't wish this pain on it. It's got to be something to stop this. And ma'am I see you. You're wearing a t-shirt in honor of one of your loved ones. Why are you here today? Well, he was just the most recent of many and I mean, he was gunned down as well as a lot of protests for their loved ones, but we're just trying to make sure this doesn't keep going. I mean, it's a devastating thing and the family has to live with it forever. So we're just trying to make a positive change and just do something positive. So we won't have to keep going through it. So a simple message with a lot of power behind it. Of course again, city leaders and law enforcement is looking to make a change with your help reporting live in downtown Asha, staples, Fox 20 news. The rest of the. How many crates is seven right now? And we've got a truck load coming in tomorrow. That's what I like to see, right? Yeah. Yeah. Hard yet. Yeah. And take that for yourself. We gotta be extra careful right now. We've got a lot of eyes on us right now. That is still pulling screens, talking crazy, man. But my people on that though, man. Appreciate that big man.
