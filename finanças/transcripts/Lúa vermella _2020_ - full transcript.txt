Now that the beast has caught them all, nobody can say I was lying any more. I have to go back. Get them out of there. Mother… help me… Mother… the mirror… Get out. Get out of the water. Rubio, get back to the boat. There is something there. On the night of Rubio’s boat wreck, a roar flooded our village. A poisoned sound came into us. The currents go north. If Rubio drowned here, we have to look for him further north. Rust. Rust. Only rusty irons. This sea is full of sunken ships. Rubio is a fibber. We have been diving together for thirty years and I have never seen anything. Arms, feet. Rotten bodies. But there is no monster. A week ago that rock wasn’t there… I believe that everything happening in our village is because of that rock. It is the wave that sank Rubio’s boat. Rubio has rescued so many corpses from the sea. Nobody knows the depths like him. As a child, he was amazing already. He would go into every underwater grotto. He seemed to live there, at the bottom of the sea. He has rescued more than forty corpses. If it was not for him, how many families would have nobody to mourn for? We have to say goodbye to the dead. Look at Rubio’s mother now. That witch is getting crazy. They say she talks to the dead. She uses mirrors to talk to them. She is scary. Let us hope the sea will bring her son back. Blood. Blood. Does nobody understand the roar? Blood is what it says. It wants our blood. Rubio is right. Nobody believes him, but he is right. Nobody believed me either. The moon is the monster’s master. It comes in and goes out like the tide. It always comes with the moon. Rubio should not have tried to hunt it. The monster is angry now. It is taking revenge on us. Rubio is right. Nobody believes him, but he is right. Nobody believed me either. The moon is the monster’s master. It comes in and goes out like the tide. It always comes with the moon. What a terrible noise. How long already? A thousand years. A thousand years under the red moon. My body is numb. My hand… I can barely move it any more. Ah… I have known something bad was going to happen since the dam got closed. I have known something bad was going to happen since they built the dam. … sailor… … he screamed he was drowning… … and the Devil answered him… What may Rubio’s mother be doing in there? You can’t trust that witch. … he screamed… … the sailor… … he screamed he was drowning… Air in the air. Water in the water. Red moon. I am calling you. Witches, make my son come back soon. Air in the air. Water in the water. Red moon. I am calling you. Witches, make my son come back soon. Mother, I'm sorry… Believe me. I didn’t know this was going to happen. I’m going to take you out of here. I will find the monster. Don’t be afraid. How long already? A thousand years? A thousand years inside the beast’s belly. What a darkness… Three witches came to help us, looking for Rubio’s body. Nobody knew where they came from. The colour of the water… The dead fish… The dam poisons everything. It is full of death. Look at us. Only the beast can live here. The monster is the sea. It has been sleeping for centuries. We are its dream. Rubio, get out of the water. Get back to the boat. As if the tide had reached the village, taking the blood from our bodies. As if the tide had reached our necks, wanting to strangle us. My drowned brother. Thirteen days lost at the bottom. I hugged him to get him out and his guts dropped out. I was left holding his blue, empty skin. The sea is the devil. I said so yesterday already, when he left to hunt the monster. But Rubio will not listen to anybody. And look at us now… We are all paying for it. That was not yesterday. That was a hundred years ago. And it will be tomorrow again, and in a thousand years. And Rubio will never listen to anybody. And you and I will still be here. Cursing. Blood. Blood. Blood is what it says. Does nobody understand the roar? Moon of blood. Moon of blood. It was the first time I entered that house. She asked me to stand in front of the mirror and she was saying, Take the breath of death away, let the breath of life come. Take the breath of death away, let the breath of life come. She grabbed a knife and said, Look at yourself in the mirror. And in the mirror I saw smoke coming out of my body. My breath is weak. I cannot feel it any more. I can only feel the monster’s. We all breathe at the pace of its breath. It comes in and goes out like the tide. It drags us to the bottom. Whoever wants evil for me, let him take it for himself. Whoever wants evil for me, let him take it for himself. Whoever wants evil for me, let him take it for himself. Whoever wants evil for me, let him take it for himself. Whoever wants evil for me… It is not the first time this happens. The red moon wakes up that beast. I already suffered its howl in Malpica a hundred years ago… … or three hundred. Thousands of deaths. If I can bear it for a little longer, maybe I can escape through the mirror again. The monster's eye… If I can bear it for a little longer… Every high tide would bring Rubio back and every low tide would swallow him again. And we are falling to pieces, like old rocks. I do not know how long I have been here. I no longer feel one thing after the other. All the waves exist now. Maybe it has always been today. It swallows the corpses. That is why the monster came up here. Because of the shipwrecks. The drowned ones that never appeared did not get lost in the sea. It devoured them. Don’t you hear the growl of the sea? The dense air… The monster is taking our lifes. Little by little. We will remain prisoners in our bodies. Damn witches! Where are you? That rock was already there one hundred thousand years ago. Everything that is happening today is because of this rock. It is the wave that sinks Rubio’s boat. Rubio is a monster. And he has to save us? This is not real. It cannot be. We are somebody’s dream. The dream of a sleeping sea. How peaceful. How horrific. The sky at night is a black sea. The stars, bright fish. The moon, a monster. The sky at night is a… … stars, bright… … moon, a monster. Andrés, can you hear me? I'm Rubio. It wants your blood. It will not stop until it has your blood. Can you hear me in there? I need a body to attack the monster. Warn the witches. Help me, Andrés. Under the white sheets our blood boiled. The eye of the monster watched us from the sky. We were ready to leave. … sailor… … he screamed he was drowning… … and the Devil answered him from the other side of the water… The monster is the moon. It devours time. Rubio, get out of the water. Come back to land. Come back to land. Blood came out of our bodies. We saw it feed the red moon. That was when Rubio came back to find us. But where would he take us?
