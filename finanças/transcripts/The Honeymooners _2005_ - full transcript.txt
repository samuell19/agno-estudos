I'm an entrepreneur, and, uh, this is gonna make me a millionaire. "Kramden International Y2K Ultra Deluxe Survival Kit"? Yeah, and when Y2K hit, you gonna need all that stuff in there. You think Y2K's gonna be that bad? You ain't been watchin' CNN? When every computer in the world shuts down on New Year's Eve, that kit, plus a check or money order for 29.99 plus shipping and handling, is the only thing that's gonna protect you against total chaos. Wow. Total chaos? Yeah. I mean, you know, if I'm lucky. I guess my dream's a little bit more practical. Oh, yeah? Like what?My own home. Nothin' fancy, just a little place all my own. You know? No landlord or haggling with the super to fix the pipes or rent increases. Just... my name on a deed and... some lawn chairs on the front porch so I can watch my kids play ball in the street. You got kids? I'm playin'. Can't you feel it, Alice? We are on the verge of a new millennium. You need to stick with your boy, because I'm about to blow up! I mean, you'll see. This job, these empty pockets, this waistline-- gone! [ Laughs ]Yeah. One day-- [ Shouts ] I'm gonna own this town! [ Siren Wailing In Distance ] Is that what you think? I own this town? I just asked you to talk to the super about the pipes, Ralph. That's all.Today? The Mets are in the seventh game of the World Series, and you know this, Alice, and you want me to think about plumbing? [ Splattering ] Okay. So it makes a little noise. But so do you, and I've learned to live with that. Ralph.[ Pipes Creaking ] Fine. But I'm not dragging the super into this. I'm calling my boy Norton. He works in the sewers. He knows pipes. Yo, Norton! What's up with the Mets?Today's the day, baby! Yeah, buddy! Oh! [ Baby Giggling ] [ Woman ] Oh, my God! What did you do to my baby? [ Baby Crying ] I didn't do anything!Never mind them, Ralphie. I got a new riddle for ya. A man was born in 1955. What made him-- Look, not now! Alice wants you to get down here and take a look at these pipes. She's driving me crazy.All right. Don't come down that. That thing is gonna kill you! He's coming down the fire escape. Hey, Alice.Hi, Ed. Come on, Ralph. A man was born in 1955. Today's his 18th birthday. How's that possible, huh? 1955 is not the year he was born, it's the number of the hospital room he was born in. Damn, you smart. What seems to be the problem, Alice? Oh, listen, Ed. [ Creaking, Splattering ] I'm on it. He's on it. Why's he gotta be on it? What happened to you? Knock, knock! Morning, Kramdens. Oh, hey, Trix. What do you got there, Trixie? Ooh, I made French toast. Alice, I tried this new powdered sugar, Tasty Meds. It's the one they give to the diabetics right when they wake up from the coma-- 99 cents. It's a slight little aftertaste, but it's still good. Right, Ralph? Mm-hmm. See? - Trixie makes Ed French toast. - That's 'cause Ed's not on Trimspa. Oh, you got jokes. You just a regular UPN sitcom, huh, Alice? I gotta get to these pipes. Look, just fix it, okay? It'll be good to have some peace and quiet around here. [ Shouts ] You-- You-- You--Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Ed, what'd you do now? They wanted me to fix their pipes, baby. Yeah, not knock a big whole in the wall! That's where the pipes are. If you'd just talked to the landlord like I asked you to in the first place--That's a much better idea, 'cause I do my best work down below. Ooh, now that is true, baby.You did say that. I'm a professional. People always call me-- [ Indistinct ] [ Chattering ] Get out! [ Trixie ] It's all right, baby. It's okay. Yeah, ah-ah-ah-ah. Take the wife, leave the French toast. Oh, man!See you at the diner, Alice! Later, Trix. Hey, Ralph, after work we're gonna watch that game-- Out!Ah! Go Mets. You are certifiable, you know that? You oughta have your head examined. I'll have my head examined anywhere in the United States. And you know what they're gonna find when they look in there? Nothin'! I ask you to do one thing. One thing! You never appreciate anything I do! You always go on and on! I can't take it anymore![ Beeping ] You gotta go. I am late. Here's your lunch. Hey, Tastykakes.Yeah. Be careful. Always am. [ Horns Honking ] Stay outta the bus lane! Hey!Vivek, my man. The Mets are goin' all the way, Ralph. You'll do very well. [ Laughs ]Oh, yeah. You know that. Do you have a wager on the game tonight, Ralph? Well, no, not exactly. Let's just say I'm taking advantage of certain economic opportunities. Or as my investment guru Bart Roberts says, "Kick open the door and opportunity don't have to knock." [ Chuckles, Coughs ] That's Bart Roberts. Order up. Girls, come over here. Come over here. I have something to show you. This is your new uniform.Oh, no, no. You don't like it? Mm-mmm, but I like the neckline, the "V." The health inspector's coming soon, so we gotta keep everything clean. Now, but I'm gonna show you something. You see this? Ahh! Look at that. See? Spotless.Voilà. Yes.Excuse me. I'd, uh-- I'd like to order. Alice, please take him, 'cause I can tell he's gonna get on my nerves. [ Sighs ] Hi. How can I help you today? Yes, Alice, I would like an egg white omelet. And if I could get a clean glass of water. Well, precious, we don't separate our eggs here, and that's about as clean as it's gonna get. Well, what do you have that's similar to an egg white omelet? Eggs.[ Scoffs ] Well, then, by all means, why don't you just bring me whatever's convenient for you? Ah! Do I need to take off my heels? No, no. Not yet. I've angered you. I'm sorry. It happens a lot. Alice, hello. Oh, hi, Miss Benvenuti. How are you? I'm fine. Hi, Trixie. How are you? Miss Benvenuti, what a pleasure. Please. If you just buy my house that will be pleasure enough. Miss Benvenuti, you're selling that cute little duplex over on Hart Street? Yes, I can't take the winters anymore. Mr. Davis here and his company are thinking of buying my house. Yes, we are. So, uh, if you girls could just go and cook something-- Ignoring you.Yeah, I wish we would've known. We've been looking to buy a duplex for years. I'm sorry, but my company's already buying this one. Yes, well, we're not a company or anything, but we would like a nice place to move into with our husbands, have a few little babies-- a little Trixie. Everything's so expensive nowadays. Yes, it is. Kind of wishing you hadn't dropped out of high school right about now, huh? Still ignoring you. So, Miss Benvenuti, how much are you asking for the duplex? Alice? Cool. Yo, Norton? [ Ed ]Yeah?Let's go, Mets! [ Man Announcing ] Bottom of the ninth inning-- [ Ralph ] This is killing me!I'm telling you, Ralph, the Mets is gonna do their thing. Don't worry about it. But Cameron can't strike out this time, man. I know.[ Ralph ] What is he doin'? Yeah, right, I know. It's crazy. The guy hit good. You know what I'm sayin'? Ed, the most amazing thing happened today. You have to listen-- Baby, we don't bother you guys when you're watchin' your stories. Let us watch the game. But we got great news though! Not now, baby, okay? This is the last inning. Shh!You have money on this game? Uh, no. Look, I am a businessman, okay? Not a gambler.[ Ed ] Come on, Mets! You guys remember Miss Benvenuti from the diner? All we have to do is come up with $20,000 for the down payment. But she's only giving us two weeks. 2-1 pitch. Cameron grounds it. [ Shouting, Indistinct ]Just listen, just listen! Come on. Between the four of us, we already have half of it. They've got $5,000 saved, and we've got $5,300, right? Something like that, give or take. He's got a full count, man. What are they trying to do, kill me right now? Wait. What do you mean, "give or take," Ralph? You didn't take any money out of our savings account, did you? I don't know what she's talking about. I know you know.Look, look, maybe I went into our accounts, and maybe I took some money. But then again, maybesomeone has a birthday comin' up... and I'm just tryin' to surprise her. My birthday's in eight months, Ralph. Okay. Maybe I got the dates mixed up. She know who the boss is. [ TV: Indistinct ] I know who the boss is.Here they go, man. Make me some money, baby!

No, it's gotta be in the other box. That's what's wrong. No, we don't play.Yeah, this for the pay-- Just-- [ Ed ] Yeah, it's this box.They just made a mistake. Yeah, yeah. It's all good. There it is. Get ready, ladies. Yeah. Yeah, just to carry us over. You'll soon see. Here we go. There they are. Boo! Ralph, why? You had to know better. This would've been big money, baby.

That's a man-purse, and I was this close to getting Al Roker to wear one on the Today Show. Wasn't I?He sure was. He was this close. I was with him the day--You're not helping. Listen, Alice. We'll get the money for the house somehow. No, we won't. [ Chuckles ] It's always gonna be like this, Trix-- living paycheck to paycheck, hand to mouth, never having anything to call our own. But, hey, it's cool, right? 'Cause most people in the world live like this. Right? Just didn't think it'd be so hard. Alice. Alice, come on.

Wow, I never noticed that! Ooh! Look. Man, she's mad, but she'll get over it. She wasn't mad. Mad you do get over. Mad I can handle. I know how to deal with mad. But the look she had on her face, it was like-- She was disappointed in me, you know? Like she didn't believe in me anymore. I don't now. If that's the case, then how do you come back from that? Show her that you're sorry. Buy her ass somethin'. With what? I'm broke! Look. Check this out. I know a dude right now selling Cadillac wheels. I'm talkin' about spinners, the gold ones.

What's up? My name is Dodge. Hey, what's up? Okay. Who? Mr. Kirby sent you?Yeah. Oh, that's cool, 'cause I'm a canine behaviorist. I train, board and breed greyhounds. I specialize in temperamentally unsound, psychologically unstable, genetical throwbacks. I do not pick up excreta. And I run my facilities right out of this place. Says here you sell time-shares in the Poconos. What? Let me see that. Oh, yeah. My bad, man. Wrong card, man. "Importifications," underage mail-order brides, S and M fashion consultant-- You know what? We don't need cards. We don't need cards. We're dog people. We got a-- a bond, a fellowship. Hey, look at the dog. Look at him. He seems really bright, alert. What's his name? That's Iggy.I'm Ralph, and this is Ed. Hey, Ralph, Ed-- You carry your dog around on a rope? You siphon gas out of a car. What's your point, man? What? What you think-- That?Yeah. You think I'm stealing? Man, that's my friend's car. Come on. We prank each other all the time, you know? I siphon gas out of his car, he siphons out of my car. Yada yada, blasie, blasie. Hey, tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna train your dog for $500-- cash. [ Exhales ] I don't know.Hey, you know what? I'll let you think about it. All right? Give you a moment. Don't worry. No pressure. I don't know, Ed. Does this guy look like a dog trainer to you?

Good decision, man.Five hundred, cash. Let's see, baby. Let me check. Hey! Hey, nice man-purse. You mean this fanny pack thing? I got this off a homeless guy in the park for a quarter. See, some sucker made, like, a thousand of these. Yeah, what are we gonna do about the trainin'? It's like this. Let me break it down for you, okay? We're a partnership now. A ménage a trois. You put in the capital, I put in the experience. At the end, you get the experience, I keep the capital. Is that cool? Great. Great. The thing is, I like to work at night, if you don't mind. During the day it's just too crowded. You know, too many people. Too many dogs. So let's say we meet out back over there about 9:00 sharp. Okay. 9:00? 9:00. Remember, there are no bad dogs. Only bad owners. All right? Remember that. I gotta bounce. [ Knocking ] Hi, Mom. Somewhere around the third flight of stairs, I think I caught T.B. [ Sighs ] Here.Oh, a pie. Oh, and box of wine.

You married a damn pervert, that's what happened. Look, it was just a big misunderstanding. Next you'll probably say you thought I was Alice. Of course I thought you were Alice. Aha! That's exactly what a pervert would say. Woman, one day you are gonna push me too far. [ Laughs ] The only thing that could push you is a bulldozer. M-Mom? Mom? How about you go wash up for dinner? 'Cause everything is under control here. And, um, I'll just deal with my little pervert here. [ Scoffs ][ Growls ] [ Growls ] What is she doin' here? I'm asking my mother for the money for the house tonight. Tonight? Yes. No, no, no, no. Not tonight. Tonight-- You can't because, uh, Norton and I have to go to the lodge. The lodge? What are you, Fred Flintstone all of a sudden? The lodge? Look, I-- Woman, I got somewhere to be. That's all you need to know, and that'sit. I refuse to lose this house over another one of your half-assed schemes, Ralph Kramden. Half-assed scheme?Mm-hmm. Let me tell you something. This country was built on half-assed schemes. I'm talkin' about real inventive stuff here. Like the guy who came up with the thong, okay? He was short on material, and he used what he had. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. I'm asking my mother for the money for the house tonight, and I expect you to be on your very best behavior. Look--Ralph... Kramden. Your very best behavior. [ Door Opens ] Well. So far everything's edible. [ Laughs ][ Chuckling ] Uh, how about I get the entrées? Oh-- "Entrées." You going to France for those? Just one good swing. What are you doin'? Trixie's coming home. I couldn't let her see Iggy. You can't leave him here. Alice's mama is over for dinner. She's in there right now, asking for house money. So if Alice get the checks and she tries to deposit-- Yes. I know. She's gonna know the account is empty. That's why this meal can't go well. How you gonna do that? I know you're probably in there eatin' all our dinners. Just don't make the same mistake you made last time. When you hit plate, stop. [ Laughing ] Oh-- Oh, you goin' straight to hell for this one. Mother Gibson, that's free-range chicken. What a chicken does on his free time is no nevermind to me. Oh, this is way too much food for me. I'm on a diet. Oh, here. Take my plate. I don't have that much.Oh, thank you, baby. You know, I wanted your mother to have the white meat. Oh, no. I'm perfectly happy with the dark. Well, give me the white meat then. No, it's fine. Give me the plate, woman! Mama? Mmm. Mm, mm, mm. The chicken is delicious. Ralph, eat. Yeah. I've never seen you turn down food before. So, what do you want, Alice?You know what? I thought we'd wait till after dinner to talk about that. [ Coughs ] I thought you'd marry a lawyer. Apparently we both thought wrong. [ Coughing ]Oh, let me guess. You need money?We wanna buy a house. It's a duplex, actually-- With Ed and Trixie. Well, you know, truth be told, buyin' a house is a big investment. Yeah, that is the truth. That is the truth, and it hurts. You know? I can see that. I've never seen you so torn up about money before. We are putting in all of our savings, but we're still a little short-- About $10,000.[ Gulps ] $10,000? Who do you think I am, Weezy Jefferson? God rest her soul. Uh-- But it-- It's a beautiful duplex, Mama, with a backyard and everything. Right near the diner, even.[ Gasping ] So what do you think? I think you should have married little Larry Fillmore. I heard he's taking over the funeral home. [ Ralph Moans ] Just... give me some time to marinate on it. That's fair enough.[ Coughing ] Is something wrong with you? You know, it's just that we've been so worried about asking you for the money for the house, and, you know, sharing a meal over it is just a beautiful thing. I'm ready for dessert. Anybody?Yeah. Mama brought a pie. And Mama's goin' go get it. Your mama's coming to the kitchen? Your mama's going to the kitchen! Tell the truth. You're on the pipe, aren't you, boy?

Uh, you know, Mom, I think he said something about a meeting at the lodge tonight. [ Groans ] Shh. Shh. Oh, well. That's more dessert for us. [ Ed Whimpering ] Ralph, I gotta confess something to you. [ Groans ] Just-- Man, just hold on.We're gonna die. I gotta get my life right with the Lord. One day I was comin' down there to get some milk from y'all on the fire escape, and I seen Alice naked. I ain't lyin'. And sometimes I think about it. You--[ Both Yelling ] Huh? [ Both Whimpering ] Ah![ Chain Clanks ] [ Dodge ] I forgot my keys. [ Ralph ] Yeah, right. Hey, I'm not gonna lie to you, man. I'm having problems, okay? My wife left me.

It's okay. It's okay. No problem. He didn't see us. Are we breakin' in here? We're not breakin' in. Why you profilin'? Why you profilin' me? It's a competitive business. I don't want other trainers to steal my secrets. Okay, fellas, dog racing is about show business, and the show counts. And it starts the minute you walk your dog onto the battlefield. And this is the walk. Brisk, brisk, brisk, brisk, brisk, brisk. Arms down. Arms down. Arms down. Confidence. Don't be arrogant. Don't be arrogant. It's not a tug-of-war. It's not a tug-of-war. [ Groans ]Watch out. Watch out. Get the dog. Get the dog. Get the dog. There you go. Good boy. He's great, man. Sixty-five pounds, less than four percent body fat. All muscles. Yeah. You know, I had a French aerobics teacher. Leslie was her name. Just like that. Really flexible. Except not enough soft places. You know what I'm sayin'? Right? [ Snickering ] [ Whines ] Okay, for Iggy to be competitive, he's gotta run at least a 32.30. This is the moment of truth, fellas. Ralph, Eddie, you ready? Three, two, one. [ Groans ]All right, fellas. We run into a couple problems. Nothing minor. I gotta train his mind. That's it, Iggy. Relax. Relax. That's it. Good boy. Breathe. [ Inhales, Exhales ] Breathe. That's it. Ruff, ruff, ruff, ruff. [ Imitating Iggy ] [ Howls ] You know, my parents find it really difficult... to explain to people what I do for a living. Hmm. Iggy, you are one of the most ancient canine breeds. The pharaoh's favorite. The Greek king's son. You're a born winner. A born winner, boy. Live up to it. [ Grunts ]Uh, I don't know. I don't know. [ With Thick Accent ] Listen to me, pooch. Okay? I'm talking to you. Nobody quits on Tony Montana, you hear me? [ Whines ]You're a dog. It's a racetrack. You can win this thing. Hey, baby, listen to me. I'm not who you think I am. I'm not the best trainer in the world. I started out with nothing, and I've still got most of it left. They wanted me to get you pregnant by a pit bull. Iggy, Iggy-- Look at me when I'm talkin' to you! Your dogs would have had little bodies with big heads, and just walkin' down the street like this. You coulda been a contender, but instead, you're a bum! You win that race, you get the power, and then you get the bitches. [ Growls ]Oh, yes. So many bitches. All right, fellas. The dog's a straight-up dud. [ Stammering ] What do you mean, the dog's a dud? You're a trainer. Train the dog. I've seen this dog move. I've seen him move too. You'rea dud. Iggy? Were you-- Were you drinkin' at the time? When you saw him move? [ Whining ]Iggy, it's not that hard. Watch this. Let me think about it. Let me just think. [ Beeps ]I got it. I got it. Why don't we Nancy Kerrigan the other dogs? You mean hit the dogs in the knee? All right. That's a little too aggressive for you? Don't worry about it.Vitamins? Little stronger than that. Works for me. Nobody needs to know. They don't screen dogs. They don't? No. No. Nobody needs to know. Just you and me. [ Watch Beeps ]What'd you get? That was fast. Hey, nice lap, Norton. [ Sighs ] [ Whines ]Eddie-- Eddie, what do you think? I don't know how we gonna get this dog to run. [ Whining ] [ Ball Squeaking ] [ Whines ] Check that out.[ Growling ] Hey, boss. Psst, psst. Check that out. You're impressed with it, ain't you? He's in. All right!Yeah! Assuming you have all the proper paperwork. You bring it to the owners' party, here tomorrow night.

Excuse me.Are you the health inspector? Uh, look. Uh, nice and clean. Spotless. No, no, no. I need to speak to Alice Kramden, please. Oh. Alice is busy.Excuse me? Do you know who I am? Uh-- Uh, no. No. You know who I am? I was born in a one-bedroom farmhouse... with five brothers-- who I raised. I was born in China 80 years ago in a Chinese rice field. I served my country in Vietnam... where I was a Golden Gloves champion three years running. Before when I come, my English not good-looking, but now I speak perfect. I raised six kids, buried two husbands... and am on the lookout for number three. Can I call you next week?What? Mama, what are you doing here?Oh, hi, baby. Uh, I just thought I'd, uh, drop this off in person. Thank you! [ Laughing ] Oh, thank you. You're welcome. Trix, we got the money for the house. I can't believe it. I didn't think you were gonna do it. Well, I was skeptical. But Ralph seemed so genuinely worried about it, I figured maybe he's just comin' around. Yeah, maybe he is.Thank you, Mama! You're welcome. Once this is leveled, it'll make a nice entry to the underground parking. [ Man, Indistinct ][ Davis ] Excuse me. Here to reconsider my offer? I'm actually here to give Mrs. B some news-- some really good news. Well, she's not here. Please share it with me.I'd love to. We're gonna own this place. Yeah.

If there's no money in her account, then why is this waitress hangin' around my property? [ Man ] Sir, I told you. I checked. They've got something somewhere. Find out what the husband is up to. Ralph Kramden. That woman I was telling you about-- Her name is Marlena. She's Puerto Rican. My God. I've tried to talk to her, but words won't come. I could tell you a thing or two about women. That's if you're ready to hear it. It all begins with letting her know who's boss. Very important. Alice! What-What are you doing here? I just came from the bank. It's a funny story. You wanna hear it? Let her know who's boss, Ralph.Uh-- Uh, look, uh-- I can explain. Oh, can you? Can you now? I tell the bank I wanna withdraw $4,000, and they tell me not only is our account empty-- here's the punch line-- we're overdrawn by $223.60. Whoa. The bank said that? No, no, no. There's gotta be a mistake, baby, 'cause I don't know nothin' about no 60 cents. Where's the money, Ralph? Uh, I can explain, all right? But, You know, taken out of context, it might sound a little crazy. Try me. Norton and I found a train in the sewer, see, and-- I want you out of the apartment, Ralph. H-Hold on. Babe, wait a minute. Listen. Listen. Then we got this dog out of the Dumpster and-- I don't wanna hear it. I don't wanna hear it. I'm done. Come on, baby. Just 24 more hours. Okay? Twenty-four more hours, and then we can get on to the life... we've both dreamed of. And what life is that, Ralph? Huh? You've always been so obsessed with your own dreams... that you never even bothered with mine. How can you say that? I want the house just as much as you do. Then why haven't you been by to see it? 'Cause-- I mean-- [ Stammering ] Because you're selfish, Ralph Kramden. And I'm done playing the fool. [ Horns Honking ] [ Man ] Come on! Move it! All right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Whatever. Go ahead. Be my guest.[ Indistinct ] [ Sighs ] [ Sighs ] [ Beeping ] Aaah! [ Dodge ] Luckily for me, man, I'm nearsighted, so I can date just about anybody, you know?

What were you thinkin', distractin' him like that? I was just trying to encourage him, Ralph. You encouraged him, all right. You encouraged him away from $20,000! Ralph, stop yellin' at me. He's gonna think you're yellin' at him. I'm not yelling at the dog. He's just a dumb animal. What's your excuse? Ralph. Ed, you know we needed this money. Now Alice will never take me back-- because of you. Ralph, calm down. I thought we were boys, man. No, no. We're not boys. We're not friends. We're notnothin'! I'm done. That's the way you feel?That's how I feel. And stay off my fire escape. [ Panting ]Come on, Iggy. Come on, y'all. Alice. Pet Cactus-- What was I thinkin'? Shoot. [ Groans ] Yeah, yeah. [ Chuckles ] "Learn and Succeed." Yeah, right. Bart Roberts. I was a sucker for ever believin' in you. Yeah, I won't be a sucker again though. Kawakami. I should have let you get this train since you wanted it so bad. Maybe you still do. Mmm-- Aaah! [ Sputtering ] Don't burn up. Come on. Don't burn up. [ Muttering ] [ Clears Throat ] Okay. [ Clears Throat ] I might be able to take it off your hands. Well, uh, the price has gone up considerably. I mean, we have to take into account my time, storage, um, fees, shipping, postage, handling-- You know, a lot of things like that. What is your price? 25,000.25,000? Okay, that was too much. Okay, 20,000. 20,000 will be fine. I'm gonna need a check right now. Hey, Larry.Ralph Kramden. What's, uh-- What's goin' on? What, are you in trouble? Look, man, I gotta get to Q's Diner by 9:00 a.m. You go that way, right?Not by 9:00 a.m. Look at it. It's, like, total gridlock.[ Ringing ] Hello? Hey, Q. It's Ralph Kramden-- Alice's husband. No, no. She's not here. No, I got the check for the house. Please. Health inspector here. Health inspector? Don't hang up, Q! I gotta get over there. Welcome to your new positions in the New York City sewer system. Today you'll join an elite group of dedicated and dependable professionals. You lucky few have survived a rigorous application process, interviews and psychological profiles. Actually, Ed, these are all convicted felons of violent crimes... taking part in a work-release program. And since there are no questions-- [ Ralph ] I got one for you. Two men are born five blocks apart. They've been best friends for 30 years, until one of 'em says some really stupid things he didn't mean. How does he get the other guy to forgive him? I'm not the one who's good at riddles. Remember, Ralph? Neither am I.What are you talkin' about? You know that book of riddles you keep on your coffee table? [ Sighs ] I found it, got me a copy and memorized it. You mean to tell me-- [ Groans ] Norton. Norton, come on. Norton. What, Ralph? What? What? You've always thought I was the smart one. And if you ever stopped thinking that then... I don't know what I would be anymore. You really mean that, Ralph? Yeah. I'm sorry. [ Sobs ] Come on, Ed. You're makin' me cry.Don't start, man. Will you-- Why do you come down here and make me cry in front of all these convicts? Now, stop it, man. I mean, I'm trying to just say what I gotta say. [ Clears Throat ] Look, hey.Yeah. Look, man.[ Sniffs ] Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know what I'm sayin'?Do I have a tear in my eye? No, you're okay. Look, this doesn't change everything. We still have issues between each other. Look, okay. I understand that. But I got the money for the house. You did?I gotta get the check to the diner before 9:00 a.m. It's total gridlock up there. I need someone who knows the city beneath the city. I need a specialist. I need you, Ed. [ Brakes Squeal ]I got you. But I have conditions. Condition number one. You gotta start lettin' me pick stuff. What are you talkin' about? You always get to pick the restaurants. You always get to pick the movies. That's because if we let you pick stuff, nothing would ever get decided. [ Brakes Squeal ] Fine! You can pick stuff. Second up, when we get around new people, you have to start referring to me as "Edward." [ Muttering ] Only you would pick a shortcut like this. That's another one. You gotta stop makin' fun of me. I'll admit, the way I do things is a little unorthodox, but that's me. The way you do things is ridiculous. Oh, I'm the one who looks ridiculous? Yeah. Aaah! - That ain't even funny. - Oh, yes, it is. We gotta go. Come on. Let's rock. Okay, Ralph, this is the big one. Hmm? You gotta promise to me that you will never yell at me... or get mad at me ever, ever again. Done.Put it on your family jewels. Put it on my family-- Oh, fine. I put it on my family jewels that I will never get mad or holler at you again. Good. 'Cause we're lost. You-- Family jewels. So, Edward--Mm-hmm? How do you suggest we proceed from here? Well, there's two ways we can go. Either that way or that way. Why don't we let you pick? Let me pick? That's my man. That's what I'm talkin' about. Which way? That way. [ Horn Blows ] It's this way, Ralph. This should be it. Straight up. Let's hope. [ Laughs ] Hey, Norton, this is it. You're my man, dog. Aaah! [ Car Door Shuts ] [ Car Alarm Chirps ] Ralph, what are you waitin' for? There's an S.U.V. on the manhole cover. You're yellin', Ralph. This way is blocked, and it's Davis. Okay, another manhole, two blocks down. [ Bell Jingles ][ Indistinct ] You think we're too late?Not if she hasn't signed yet. You don't have to read it. Oh. Glad you two made up. But Alice isn't here, Ralph. She didn't want to stick around and watch that. Ma'am, don't sign that! That's no good.That's good. Miss Benvenuti--Oh, no, no. Don't put that down. You can't stop once you've started. It's-- It's unethical. I'm Ralph Kramden, Alice's husband. Uh, oh, well, this is, uh-- Well-- Mr. Q? It's a little wet, isn't it? It's dirty, but, uh-- I mean, we can blow-dry it off and do whatever-- But it's for you. I'll take the check as is. Okay, everyone, just-- Look, I'll-- I'll give you even more, all right? Thank you--You got it. but I don't think so. I'd rather have my house remain a home. Yeah! Thank you, Miss Benvenuti. Thank you. Thank you.Thank you, Mr. Kramden. It's a pleasure doing business with you. This is business. It's not personal. [ Karate Yell ] Miss Benvenuti, we'll be calling you. All right. [ Vehicle Approaching ] [ Exhales ] Ralph-- Just give me a second, okay? Alice, I've wasted so much time, made so many bad choices. There's only one thing I've ever done right, and that's love you. Baby, let's go home. You mean the one we just bought? How did-- How did you do that? Norton helped out a little bit, but no one deserves this more than you, Alice. Baby, you're the greatest. [ Brakes Squeal ][ Glass Shatters ] All right, guys, quit your pissin' and moanin'. The doghouse is not that heavy, and it goes in the back... facing east so it gets feng shui, you got it? And Mama Gibson, please don't drop another box. I don't got insurance, okay? You don't have no manners either, Mr. Eazy Dodge. You're gonna get into it with me, are you? That's all right. Ladies, please hurry up. We're gonna have a lunch break. ...and make this house a home. Amen. Amen. All right, eat up, everybody. [ Mrs. Gibson ] Thank you, sweetheart. Y'all, here we are-- Finally. To our own home. Cheers, y'all.[ Trixie ] Cheers. [ Chattering ] Hey, Ralph. Ralph. I got a surprise for you. Let go. Let go. Let go. Good boy. I trained Iggy, right? He's gonna be your dog servant. Fetch you a beer, get you a newspaper when you want. Isn't that your train right there? Would you look at that? A million dollars. Yeah, Ralph. Isn't that your train? The one with the solid brass trim? Shut up.What? Oh, yo, man. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Ralph, you gonna watch the game later on? Solid brass? Ralph, you said you wasn't gonna get mad at me no more. No. No, Norton, I'm not gonna get mad. No, I'm not gonna yell. I'm just gonna kill you! Where you goin'?Run, baby! I know where there's another train-- and it's got a bell too. You better know where there's another train. Come on, man! For real! [ Speaking Indistinctly ] See, Ed here is a special child. [ Yelling ] [ Laughing ] Stop rubbing on his balls. Get out the chair, Iggy. Is that his balls? Oh, man. Why didn't you tell me? Well, my father used to train neglected Chihuahuas with Down Syndrome, and then-- It's not that he has any kind of mental problem, he just likes--[ Laughing ] Let it go. Sitting up here looking like a birthday balloon. Sitting up here looking like a bottle of dishwashing liquid. Kumquat-- Summer squash-- Stick of butter, and you want me to let it go? You look more like a piece of-- [ Speaking in Spanish ] [ Bleep ] [ Speaking Indistinctly ] I'm Ronald.And I'm Ernie. [ Both ] And we're the Isley brothers. [ Singing ]
