Tell me, lawyer, who is gonna think about my children? Do you know what he answered? What do I know! Become his friend! You tell me, Mrs. Cecilia! This time it's a long thing for me, they gave him four years! Three years for mine and seven months. Now the judges have got worse, first for a little robbery they gave you a year. They don't care anymore. Stinky people, they got much worse. But it's because of the liberals! - My poor husband! - Because of the politicians! Madam. That's right! The politicians! With all the troubles poor people have they complicate things! To exacerbate the authorities. They want to make a revolution! The revolution to move the Pope from Rome to Piemonte! Good deal! They want to make war against the French, and they have a king who can't even speak Italian! - A French king! - Do you hear her? - A French king! - Do you hear her? She can't say it, you know? Ignore her! God forbid the Piemontesi people arrive the liberal lords would realize it They burn churches, they steal. Do you know what they do to the women? You wish! Finally you would find someone to calm you ugly toad! Oh, when you talk to me, you have to wash your mouth, you know? You are the ruin of Rome! If the Pope doesn't react, it's all you liberals' fault! Go to hell! - You really should clean your mouth! - Mrs. Teresa! What's wrong? Leave her alone, she talks nonsense! I know but she provokes me! All right, you're right, every time the same story! What are we doing? Shall we open now? No, no, let them wait. Mrs. Teresa? Mrs. Cecilia? My husband has been pardoned! He'll get out in a few days! Thank God! Now it's time, let's go! Come on let's go brides, come on! I'm happy, at least one who is reasonable! One who has requested the pardon! Come on, come on, let's go. Come on, let's go! Do not bother your mother now. Poor woman! - Yes, you're right Augusto, but I... - Shut up! Let's go! You all go! God this cough! Hello how are you? I'm like a Pope! My God! And Mariuccio? Mario is fine. I had thought about sending him to the country, for a month in Genzano, at least he's with your big brother He'll be better, he has more company. He'll eat better, don't you think it's a good idea? You look worn out, Teresa! I don't like it. Augusto, you must make me happy! You have to ask for a medical examination. In here, with your cough! What's wrong with you, it's not it's not a shame, love! It's your right! Teresa, do you remember? What should I remember? - How beautiful you were! - Stop it! I've never been beautiful! You were You were a queen! Yes, the Queen of wands! I hate this cough! This cough, this cough! I can no longer hear you coughing like this. Augustus, will the day come again, when we could live in peace, again? Teresa, but you know that sometimes I wake up at night, and it seems to me that it is morning. Like once, do you remember it? I always woke up first, and I started looking at you. You slept quietly, serene, you looked like a little girl! Then you opened your eyes too. Yes, and you started giving me hard time. And you "come on, it's late!" you said immediately, so I wouldn't look at you And we would get dressed in the dark, slowly. Not to wake Mario, he was little. And then at work, all day together, to work like hell! You always grudging, with your ideas in mind! And you always in love, that smile that you have only when you sleep. And that I'm the only one to know. Augusto, do we want to ask for this medical examination? Yes, yes. Good morning! - Good morning Mrs. Teresa! - Who is that? You don't know her? It's Teresa Parenti! From Viviani's woolen mill. - Ah! - Poor thing, her husband has been in jail for three years. - They have a little son! - Now I remember! Let's go for a run, come on, come on! No! Yes, yes. Palatine fortress guard, rogue brigand, when the Pope goes into the sedan, he feels like a king. And now it's up to me! Women, women! Women! Women! I sell and buy hair! Come here! Yes. Look at this stuff! But the hair must be seen loose! They also walk! Mrs. Maria? How much do you take for that lice of your daughter? Ugly son of a Swiss guard! Come on! Look at this stuff, isn't it beautiful? Well... One, two! What do you want mom! You shouldn't be out in the street! I do not like this game, you'll get hurt! Mario do not make me angry, walk! - Come on! - Walk home! Mario if you blind one eye, when you come home I'll fix it! I'm playing, mom! This little boy always wants to win! Where are you Mario? I'm here! Come on! Yes! Come on! - Let's go home! - Good morning! Good morning. Mario come home! How is Augusto? White and red, he looks like a spider, how can he be? He's in jail! Goodness Gracious! What should I say Mrs. Giovanna! I pity them because I'm Christian! But they looked for the misfortune! But why are they involved with the Piemontesi? How do you say, if everyone would mind their own business, the world would be happy! Right! You know what? Go to hell! Mario. What, mum! Mario, do not make me repeat again, come on let's go! Just a minute! No, no minute, come back home, let's go! Come on! Do not make me angry, Mario. Damn it! Oh, what are you doing? Did you move the fight? It's my turn! One two... Mario, now if you're sweaty, you don't know what I'll do! - Good morning don Aldo. - Mrs. Teresa, I mean, you can't see anything in these stairs! Praised be Jesus Christ! Always be praised! No, do not close the door, I'm waiting for my son! Take a seat. Take a seat. Your stairs become longer and longer! - Why? - Or my floor is getting shorter! - Take a seat, I'll be right back. - Thank you. - Take a seat. - Are you preparing something to eat? Right. Go ahead! I'll catch my breath and I'll leave. And what are you preparing? Water. I'm preparing water for chicory. Tonight we'll have bread and chicory. Refreshing! At least that's what they say. What doesn't kill you, makes you fat, Don Aldo! Chicory does not cost a thing! Well, it costs to pick it up at 5 in the morning! I, I've brought you this, this thing, this half caciotta cheese! For the child. A shepherd, brought me a whole one. - Oh yes? - Yes, by grace received! Ah! Yes, just two weeks ago, he introduces himself and tells me, Don Aldo, you must pray for me. But you have to pray a lot, because you are worthy, and the Eternal Father will not say no. I say, my son, what sins do you have on your conscience, speak, let it out! Open up. He says nothing. A desire for grace. If you ask the Eternal Father, he will not say no! So? So, a shepherd so confident, I did it! So, don Aldo? All right, all right. This morning he comes to church, he makes a mess he pulls me out of the confessional! Then I gave him the caciotta cheese! He began to kiss my hands! I say, calm down my son! I understood that you are happy, and I'm glad you're happy, but I mean so this prayer had come at the right time Yes. Yes. And since the Eternal Father could not say no to me then his mother-in-law got killed! This is the grace! And so now he has become the master of 22 more sheep! You understood? I understood! And what have you done? What was I supposed to do? I threw the cheese at him! Don Aldo, but what are you doing? Don Aldo, what are you doing? Do you want some anise with fresh water? Thank you. I'll rinse the glass. nice and fresh - Like chicory! - Come on! - 22 sheep! - Can you believe it? - Unbelievable! - No, no, it's enough! A little drink! sit down, keep me company. All right. I came, also to talk to you about something. You could earn some money. I wish! Vannutelli's butler is looking for people to do, some cleaning in the building, before the prince, comes back from the countryside, you understand? So I could refer you. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Only, do not make me look bad. What do you mean look bad? Don't talk bad about anybody, be quiet. Because in that building, everyone thinks in one way! Hot-headed people like your husband are not so well regarded...got it? I got it, I got it! I'll shut up! If they do not provoke me! Because it's useless to delude ourselves, Don Aldo! We are marked! Everyone knows our ideas! Beautiful ideas! All right, don Aldo! Eh? Let's not go there, one more time. Wait a minute, sorry, Mrs. Teresa, if there was one who gave you a hand, not to reproach, for heaven's sake! He was a humble representative of the church. Not those with different ideas! But you are not a humble representative of the church! - No? - No. And who would I be? You are Don Aldo. Have you seen Augusto? I've been there, I've been there. Oh yes? Did you tell him that his Piemontesi arrested Mazzini? And have exiled his beloved Garibaldi to Caprera? - Did you tell him? - No. I did not tell him. And you made a mistake. Because if you want him to understand, and decide to sign the request for pardon you must tell him these things, Teresa because they are true! They're real! And Augusto must open his eyes! You believed in it. You believed in it. You believed in Mazzini, Garibaldi. At this time you were... You make me ramble. You believed, in the unity of Italy! Alright then. You have believed so much, that now the poor Augusto is in jail! And it's been three years! But now you see it too, what happens in Rome! No one believes in it anymore here in Rome! And those few, perhaps, perhaps I say, still believe in it, at least they have learned to be smart! And they are holed up in their warm homes! Eh! You have to make it clear to that crazy head of Augusto how things really are! No more chit-chat. His king has put Mazzini in jail! His king shot Garibaldi! Shut up! The Roman liberals, they are on a full stomach, they make the sign of the cross and go in procession, my dear! They understood! And Augusto Parenti cracks in jail! Augusto Parenti has his own ideas. he doesn't want to dirty his hands by signing the request of pardon to the Pope Don Aldo! You're stubborn, Teresa! - Stubborn! - Maybe! Yes. This isn't heroism, your poor husband, is a deluded, irresponsible fool! And selfish! Yes, because one who has a wife and children! Don Aldo, please. I did not ask you anything, therefore, you came here to lecture me? Sorry, no it's not that, you see, I wanted to explain my position to you. Because it's not that, imagine if a priest like me. Imagine. No, I mean. I have always spoken fondly with you, let's say so. You would be a perfect family if politics were not involved. I don't want to be preachy but I want to tell you. - Well... - Mum. - What did you do? - Mariuccio. - And what have you done! - Look at you, I knew it! I've been calling you for two hours. What have you done? Show me! What a bump, look at this! What did you do? What did you do there? Nothing, that son of... The son of the greengrocer in Via dei Capettari! It's a scratch, ouch you hurt me! But how many times have I told you Mario come up, Mario come up, Mario come up. What should I do to you now, eh? Nothing. I do not know. You tell me don Aldo, what am I to do with this son of... Oh well, it's gonna be my fault, I know! We need the stick, the stick! - Like I didn't have enough! - What are you doing? I know what I should do with you! Quiet, you idiot. Now you got a bump! You didn't listen, see? What does the fourth commandment say, do you remember? The fourth, come on! Fourth. honor, honor thy father, the father, mom, how is dad? He's fine, he sends his love. - Quiet now. - Take it. This is St. Agnes, It's miraculous, you know? Now you go there, you lie down on the bed and you put it on the scratch! You'll see that it will be better than the knife, the wraps, everything. - See how beautiful she is! - Little boy? Come on, take Saint Agnese, you put it on the bump and everything is finished! Well! Poor son, what can he do! All day alone, always thrown in the middle of the road. - It's not his fault! - Don Aldo? Shall we start with the story of the seminar, again? - No, for heaven's sake! - Come on. It's just that if I were you, I would think about it seriously. Why are you saying that? To enter the seminary, it takes a calling, doesn't it? Oh sure! - Mario, he is the son of his father! But the calling is a secondary thing! I mean, I mean that in the seminary, the child would be guarded, fed, dressed! And he would study! The calling will come later. And if it were to come, then it will mean that that was God's will! If instead it does not come, even in this case, it would always be God's will, always! Am I clear? The church doesn't wish to have the wrong priest! Eh! If he doesn't become priest it's fine! But in the meantime the study will have opened his mind, understood? And tomorrow, being clean, shod and dressed, will be respected by everyone, because only education, makes you earn respect! He could face life, with clearer ideas! Educated. Prepared. Eh? Think about it Teresa! Think about it! Also for the sake of Augusto. Yes. Because with the child in the seminary, I think, it will be easier, won't it? Find a good word, support, authority. I say yes, though, even in case who is gonna tell him? He's capable of anything! But sorry, Teresa, but why do you have to tell him? Not right away maybe later. Mariuccio. Mariuccio. Did you understand? It's something like that, it's like going to school. Yes, but dressed as a priest. What does it mean, what does it mean! It's how Mum says, the seminar is like a school, a kind of college. Of the priests. All right it's a college of priests. We do not like priests in my house. Mario? He has nothing to do with it! And yes I know, I'm not a priest, I'm Don Aldo. All right, anyway, kid, if you do not stop messing up this poor woman, one day I'll...it's a shame! Even mom has my same ideas. - Mario! - Shut up, You should thank God from morning to night! Yes, because it was him it is through the intercession of our Lord, do you understand? Yes sir, did you understand? Our Lord has given us the grace to enter here, do you understand? Here you can become someone, and help your mother, right? When you get out of here you'll be somebody else! A priest. Somebody else! Little boy, you're not stupid, you must understand me! We are talking about your future, we are not playing around! But I mean... Here are many kids of your age, Mario! You will have many friends, you will learn many things. Mariuccio, you must be good. You must love me, you have to help me. You think I'm happy, that I had to send you here? Mario! I'll be alone. - But I wanted to... - What? Anyway, if it's for your own good Mum is happy too, did you understand, love? But when are you coming? This will also depend on you, right? Be patient. If you are good, if you are obedient if you behave as you should mom can come often, almost always, right? Don Aldo. Ah it's him. here we are! Are you Mario Parenti? - Yes. - Welcome! Sorry. Bye, sweetheart. But are you coming on Sunday? No this one, the other one I'll come. But look, they make me come only if you are good, understood love? Come soon mum. Hey! Keep it, come on! - Shall we go? - Yes. It won't last, he'll run away! No! He won't run away. Yes, he will! Mrs. Teresa, are you crying? but do not worry, it will be like home. He will study He will have a life! As you say! So, Mario? You are the youngest here! You're happy? Mario! You must reply! You must learn to answer! Don't worry! It's nothing! Do you see what I'm doing now? I'm doing a nice little thing! Easy. You'll see, you'll see! Dario come here! Vittorio! Four, five! Done. Did I hurt you? It was nothing, I told you so! Keep it, bring it to your mother, keep it as a souvenir. And do you know what we do now? I'll cut it all, so you're like the others! Come on. Mario! You're so good! There it is! A little bit more. This passage we will read now is the parable, of the father of a family, from the Gospel of St. Matthew. At that time, Jesus explained this parable, to his disciples. In the kingdom of Heaven, a father went out early in the morning, to find works for his vineyard. And after discussing the daily pay for his workers he sent them to his vineyard. Outside on the third hour, he saw the others standing idle in the square. And he said to them: "you too go to my vineyard and I will give you what will be right!" - Will you give me that? - but what do you want, this is mine! Come on! Come on! On the sixth and ninth hour, Just a little thing! Silence. - What did I do? - Shut up! He found others who were there and he asked them: here, all day idle?> They answered And he says: . In the evening, the owner of the vineyard, told the farmer: starting from the last one up to the first ones. On the tenth hour, some others received money. Then the first ones, thought they were getting more. But they also received, some money. Do you know that my father is in jail? Why? Did he steal? What are you talking about? My father is in politics! as they received the money, they murmured against their father. You see!! He stole! The latter have only done one hour. I can't stand it anymore! I'm very tired! I can't take it anymore! I just can't do it! Be quiet! Don't be messy! Get in the line! Are you ready? Who is the first one, then? Carnieri Orlando, politician. Ah! Carnieri, next! Luigi Anzellotti, from the Town Hall! Anzellotti! Signorelli Pino, politician! Signorelli! Locutory Pecolucci Gilberto. There's no hurry, the prisoners do not run away! but time runs out! Be careful, the other Sunday, in your park, I found two hairpins! I must have dropped them! Inspection. Giovanelli, Town hall! Inspection. What beautiful hair you have! - Good morning! - Good morning! - What's in there? - Always the same! Always the same things, but it's not for you! - You bring the eggs to your husband, eh? - Right. - Good morning, sergeant. - Good morning, Mrs. Teresa! Listen! I wanted to tell you, why you don't convince your husband to ask for a medical examination? I know, I always try, every time I come here. But he has a bad cough, and being in here is not the best way to heal! Later on it'll get worse and worse! I know. Hopefully, he'll listen to me this time! My heart is broken! Inspection? There's no need. Let's go! Go Mrs. Teresa. - Thanks, sergeant. - Not at all. Good morning. Go, go, madam. Next. Cinquini Renato Town hall. But no, mom, don't worry I'm with friends, there is Augusto, and the professor who teaches me so many things. Yes, yes my son, yes. Do not worry, mom don't worry. - It's difficult. - Listen! And the woolen mill? Did they reopen the woolen mill? But why should they reopen it? Well, but ... But do you remember what the judge said, at your trial? A den of liberals, of traitors! Do you remember it, yes? All of that people all men and women, from the first to the last are dangerous! - Do you remember? - It was a den of liberals. And we were first, you and me! Did you hear from Nino? - Nino? - Yes! No. But I thought I told you that he is in Florence. Tell me, do you remember the portrait that Nino made of you? Well? I never told you, but that portrait. I was so jealous Jealous of Nino? No, fool Of the others, of those who looked at him! He had made a neckline! Don't be silly! Come on! And the others? Do you see them? The notary, Manni, Sorbelli. Yes. They are all fine. but do they help you? Yes, when they can I do not need anything. You know, I don't see them often. I don't see them often. We must be careful. What do I do, if something happens to me too, I leave Mario alone? They must meet Mario. One day he must know that his father is a gentleman. That I'm not here because I'm a hangman, you know, a thief! Mario will have to know these things! He already knows, he already knows. Augusto, do you know the good news? No, what? Bezzi will get out in a few days! But how? He had to do four more years! Well, he decided, to request the pardon! and they granted him. He is sick too and he has family. Did Bezzi sign the request for pardon? Poor fellow. No, look, it's not his fault, you know, that's his wife. Of course, the children, the relatives. Everyone was crying to convince him. Poor fellow. And he fell for it! The request of pardon to the Pope! How can he go around Rome! Isn't it better to die here as a dog? Sure! To set the example for the children! And the other fearful liberals, who are hiding! What a shame! Do I look worn out? It's so good to have a husband in prison, who sets examples! In the morning you wake up and look at yourself in the mirror, you see yourself, beautiful, rested, calm and you say: have a husband in jail!> What are you saying, Teresa? You're not Bezzi's wife, you're different! We are different! You're right, we're different, but but you, you're my husband and you're sick, I have to get you out of here! Even if I had to turn over all of Rome! Did you see those grapes? - Yes, yes. - Look! Good morning. Good morning. I want a kilo of grapes. Look at that caciotta cheese! How much for those jugs? Mrs Teresa, how was your day? Bad, madam, no one wants chicory anymore! A little donation for the souls of the dead! - Mrs. Nanni good morning. - Good morning! My son is coming tomorrow, are the sardines fresh? Very fresh! Help yourself, here you are! Thank you. Dear Mrs Teresa, you made the right choice! What? Well, as things are now today the priests rule, tomorrow who knows! The only thing to do is what you did! What do you mean? With your Piemontese husband, It was better to put your child in the sacristy! - So, in any situation... - Mrs Nanni, nevermind! I can't digest sardines, sorry, I'll pass! Well, what did I say? Get out of the way I have to work, let's go! Order omnipotent hordes! You order omnipotent hordes. Blessed Mary always virgin! Blessed Mary always virgin. Blessed Michael the Archangel! Blessed Michael the Archangel. Blessed John the Baptist! Blessed John the Baptist! Holy Apostles Peter and Paul! Holy Apostles Peter and Paul! Almighty and holy. So, I'll take Capponi to Genzano, father. See you in a week.- Goodbye. - Praised be Jesus Christ. - Always be praised! So, Mario, what were we saying? Angels, archangels, principalities. Podestà, virtue, domination, thrones, cherubs and seraphims! Good boy! Good boy. Now let's see... The bell! So enough for today. Anyway, Mario, tomorrow, Tomorrow your mother will come for you! You're happy? Thank you, father. You know mom, I learned to serve mass. And since I recited the whole Mass in Latin, Sunday they made me read during lunch. But what do you mean? Yes! While others eat there is always one of us who reads aloud! but usually the old ones do it! So you didn't eat? Readers eat first! Are you sure they feed you, my love? Maybe it's the hat you are wearing, but look at your little face you look like San Luigino! Because this week, they only give us bread and milk! We are fasting! - What are you doing? - Fasting! No way. Why they don't do it only? What do the kids have to do with it? Let's go, let's go. Come on, get up. Really? Is it him? He looks like a priest! Let's say something to him! I'll tell him! You tell him. Mario, do you have any underwear underneath? Cockroach! - Stop making fun of him! - He's also a priest! All right, let's start playing again. Be quiet! You must be good! Shut up. Bye! Where is he? Mariuccio! - What? - Are you feeling bad? What are you doing? - I saw St. Agnes! - Who did you see? Yes, Saint. Agnes, she was so beautiful! All white with black hair, loose on the shoulders and she had a light in her hand! She was like Don Aldo's saint! - It was her! - It was St. Agnes. It was her! - It was her. - But you do not believe it! And who can it to be! - Really mother, it was St. Agnes, I recognized her, she smiled. - I believe it. - Her! Understand, mom? - It was her, yes, I know! No, you're coming to bed with mom now, in the beautiful bed and go to sleep. Yes, yes. Come on! Good. All right. Mom, she was walking in the sky and told me to be good. - Of course you should be good! - She was so beautiful! I know she was beautiful! But think about it, mom, think about it, I had a vision! - Of course it was a vision. - The vision! It was a vision, but now you have to go to sleep. - But...- Do we want to sleep now? - Come on then. - Alright then. All right, now go to sleep. Sleep... Sleep... Sleep... Mrs. Giovanna? Mrs. Giovanna! Mrs. Giovanna? Mrs. Giovanna! One moment, I'm coming! Who is it? Ah, it's you, I did not even understand who it was! I just wanted to say, tell your daughter, that whore, that if she wants to go make love to the French soldiers she shouldn't pass by my windows because the child gets shocked! How is that possible? Have a good evening Mrs. Giovanna! -What are you saying? Eminence, as I told you, my concerns... Dear Don Aldo, I don't want that the fact that you worry for the people under your protection I'll do it all your care, is just a face. What do you mean? to hide your sympathy for their political ideas. - No, Eminence. - Don't say that. Don Aldo, you are a very good Christian. - Allow me. - but this is a serious moment, - Yes. - There are some concerns! From Turin and Paris, we are receiving very serious news. Vittorio Emanuele is already mobilizing several divisions on our border! this is the moment when, - If you please... - Of course, of course I'm here for this. I wanted to say, that I'm trying to do only, the interests of the church. I mean, Parenti I told you about didn't use to come to the parish, in fact she never did. Now instead she comes, prays confesses. And also, her husband. - Come on! - No, I am convinced, I am convinced. When he will realize, when he will understand how much we were interested in him, how much we cared for his family then then he will understand, where the truth is, he will have to understand it. Let's hope so. And also their son before entering the seminary, he had a difficult character, let's say! Now instead, he seems that, he was touched by Grace. Then you will hear him, during the function. He is our soloist. Eminence, he sings like an angel! And let's go hear this angel! Thank you. Come on, come on quickly inside! Shut up Go in the front row, hurry! And in your place! Ouch! Shut up, shut up, shut up, His Eminence is here. Be careful. There she is! Hello. For Christ our Lord, amen. Amen. That way, go up the stairs and then right. All right, thank you very much. You are welcome. Sister, we have a special permission, can we pass? Sorry, they have a permission from the vicarship! What? They have a permission from the vicarship! Come forward - Come in. - Thank you, thank you. No nothing, it's the usual formality. Got it? Look, Augusto Parenti, I'm his wife. All regular, there is the signature of the commander in person. I understand, all right, go go. Thank you. - Cops, I can't stand them. - We must try to understand them, they do their duty, they come from the village. Keep calm. Where is he? Here, here, here. but no, I told you when Augusto arrived at the hospital the crisis was already over! Of course he's a bit weak - For this, may God forgive me, it seems bad to say it that we must take advantage of his weakness, right? - What are you saying, Don Aldo! - That's fine. Sister? - Parenti Augusto, comes from .. - Yes, I understood, that way. Thank you, - Who is it? The poor guy... - He's bad, really bad! Do you need anything, Augusto? Nothing from you! Cop! What? - But think about it Teresa! - No. Under these conditions, no. - How could I tell my husband? - You tell me. Either Augustus signs the request for pardon now, or he will never do it! Do you understand? When the body is weak, the mind can also be weak, isn't it? For my Augusto, these criteria don't count! The worse he gets, the angrier he gets. - Who are you looking for? - Sister? Sorry. I'm looking for Parenti Augusto, - He's a... - What department? - Eh? - Which department? I do not know, they brought him here yesterday. He's a prisoner. No, he's a politician. Ah! Follow the corridor and turn left. You will find the guards, you can't go wrong. Thank you. Thanks sister. Who are you looking for? Parenti Augusto. Which bed? That one over there. Guard, come here! Here, it's all right. Come on! Augusto. Augusto. I'm Teresa. Teresa. Thank God. - I'm better, you know. - Please. Calm down. I'm better, Teresa. I'm fine. Yes. I want to take him away from here, I can't deal with it anymore Don Aldo. - I want to take him home. - Of course. Of course, listen to me Teresa, the only way is this. Here it is, here is the request for pardon. Look, he just needs to sign down here, and tonight, I'll take it to the archbishop, I've already told him about it. He's willing. You already prepared it! - A while back. This is inkwell, - and pen. - Also. And now? And now how do I do it? Just a cross! A cross, as long as he puts a cross below what do you mean a cross? My Augusto knows how to write well. I know, but it's simpler, isn't it? just a cross and when it's done it's done! you'll bring him home! Don Aldo, but if I write the cross, nobody will know! I know it! It is a fake before God and modestly even before the undersigned. If he puts the cross on it under these conditions, isn't this a fake? Oh yes, but not "de facto". - What? - Yes and no.

You don't want to do anything for us, do you? No? You want me to sign! And you want me dead! Go away! Go away, coward! What do you want me to do? Let me die in here! Did you understand? Leave me! I want to die in here, infamous! I want to die here, here! Down, stay down! Is there something wrong? Mr. Duilio, what does that say? Wait a second. The citizens, are asked to stay in their homes, where troops can watch over some delinquents who threaten order and public security. September 12, 1870. Signed by The general, commander of the Kanzler troops. Here we are. Bingo! Speak quietly! The Zampetti are here. Thieves! They're done bossing around! Shut up, they are still the Pope's auxiliary guard! Not for long. You know how many of these thieves will have to run away when the Piemontese arrive? What does the sign say? I can't read! But I know it's good stuff for us, because in Rome at night you can't get around. Worse for them if we catch them! - Goodbye Nino! - Goodbye, thank you. Bye! Good luck! You too! Stop! Who's there? Who's there! Who are you? Come out! I do not know, it seemed to me .. - What is it? - Don't know. Never mind, It was a mistake! You know what, let's go get another one... but it's all closed. Who says so? Stop! I'm gonna shoot! Stop! Empty your pockets! Don't you know you can't walk in Rome, at night? It is written on all the walls! And who knows how to read! Come on! Good job! We have to get rid of all the filthy ones! Yes, yes. Take the other rifle. You will need them soon. The time has come, go! See you later! Bye! - He's crazy! - Oh well... But let's throw it all out and let's go! Augusto! Augusto! Augusto, they will hear you, are you crazy? No, Teresa it's me, Nino Colasanti! Nino. Oh Nino! Come, come in! I didn't know anything about Augusto! I'm sorry! I must confess that I really counted on you two. I have nothing at home, I can't even offer you a glass of wine! If you want a coffee or anise, please help yourself! Make yourself at home! I know Teresa thank you, but I'll wait for you! Here I am. You are always the same! Always beautiful! Do not say foolish things! You never change. You have not changed at all. Do you want a coffee? - Thanks, do not worry. - A coffee? - No thanks. - Do you want some anise? - Yes, okay. A bit of anise, with nice fresh water. Here it is. Do you remember the portrait I gave you? - It's in Venice - Really? - In a big palace! You were wearing a black corset, and the coral blobs in drops! Dear Nino, I sold them! I sold everything! But talk to me about Augustus. They caught him. Immediately! It was a spy! They discovered the weapon storage at the woolen mill. The French arrived an hour before the distribution. It was a massacre! They killed 16. And the others. Scira is here with me, and Augusto poor man, Augusto is like they killed him! Well... Drink up. And the child? Mario? He must be older now. Let's see, now he's almost 10, right? No, he's 11, almost 11. He is a little boy but he's almost 11. I remember him very well, lively, dark, all curly! Poor boy, now they have him all shaved. What? Because he is staying at some of our acquaintances' place Augusto's brother's house. In the countryside, near Ariccia - at least there he is better. - Very well. Better to keep him away from the crowd it's just a matter of a short while. Weeks, maybe even less, days maybe, do you understand Teresa? And Augusto will come out, we'll let him out. Augusto is bad, so bad. Days ago they admitted him to the hospital, but then, they took him back to prison. He says that there are, there are little hopes. You shouldn't get discouraged. Teresa! Don't say that. We must have trust, Teresa. Augusto is above all sick in morals, in spirit. And that will heal, I assure you. Yes. But, let's talk about you. How did you come back to Rome? Vittorio Emanuele has made a decision. 35,000 men are advancing in the Papal state, for Rome! 5 divisions! Two of which, entrusted to former garibaldini soldiers! Yes but, Garibaldi, Yes Teresa. They say that... It's true he's in exile, and that's also why I'm here. Teresa, we have to wake the Roman liberals, call them to revolt! We must not allow that the sacrifice of the dead, the wounded, the exiles, of Roman political prisoners, be forgotten! We have struggled, we have fought with all our strength, so that Rome became ours. And not only conquered by Vittorio Emanuele, It's us Roman liberals who elected Vittorio Emanuele. We are with Garibaldi, with Enrico Giovanni Cairoli and a thousand more! And now we, the conquerors, we can't, we do not want to accept, to be conquered, you understand Teresa? You understand how important it is for us, that they recognize participation in this conquest, active participation, to this conquest! So, we have to unite again, arm ourselves, we have to redo the barricades, go back to the times of the Gianicolo, of Villa Glori, of your woolen factory Aiani! No, it's a dream! When you speak, I want to believe everything you say. You're right when you say that we should but you have been missing from Rome for three years. Everyone sleeps here, they are all hidden! Arm ourselves with what? There are not even the slingshot clubs in Rome! The weapons are coming! By the river, I assure you Teresa. They will arrive the same way, with whom I arrived. And it is above all for this, that I need you. Let's go! Five pieces! Colasanti is in Rome. Come on! All right, they're gone, keep reading. Where were we? And so, Cola Di Rienzo decided, that in any case something had to be done. Rome was torn by hardships and hunger. He went knocking from door to door, as long as he could not join a delegation, at whose head he introduced himself to the pontiff, without fear, And when he was admitted to his presence, fearless, he said: "people need their freedom!" Did you understand? Those were not... You have understood? Of course! That man said that .. Shut up kid! - Cola Di Rienzo must have studied! - Sure. His father was a kitchen boy in the tavern! Let me talk about it, that's important. And the mother was a washerwoman. Like my mother, she was a laundress too! Only that I can't even do my signature! His will was so strong that he learned to read by himself and studied. Augusto listen. Augusto! Be quiet! Because he already had faith, understood? At the age of 25, Cola Di Rienzo was already a notary, and everyone knew him in Rome! Giulio listen to me. And the rich too all went to him for advice. It was a terrible, difficult period in Rome. Well it's like now! - Augusto! - Shut up. The Pope then was in Avignon. So now it's even worse. Yes, but now it's a matter of little time, right? Hey listen! Stop it! Augusto, I have to give you some news, it's important! What do you want? Colasanti has arrived! - Nino? - Yes, Colasanti is in Rome! - Who told you? - The cleaning guy. - Really? - Colasanti is in Rome! So we we must do something! Yes, but what do we do? We have to get busy! Come in! May I come in, Mr. Notary? Come, come Nicolino! What's up? There is a woman. A woman of Quadrino? I do not know her. It's me, Teresa Parenti. Ah, Mrs. Teresa! What a pleasure! Come, come, take a seat! Nicolino close, close the door. Please Please, Have a seat. When you arrived, did someone see you come in? I mean, any guards? Nobody. Nobody. In your position, you could be, followed, monitored... you understand me and you have become more cautious! Even more important, it seems to me, isn't it? Yes, because three years ago, you were in a little office, now instead... Why did you come? Right... That's what I ask myself! But since I have come, I must tell you. Colasanti is back. He's back with other patriots. He says the time has come. To stop it. Mrs. Teresa! and to be responsible. But do you realize that today Rome is full of policemen, Frenchmen, of spies. The Piemontese will arrive, yes but when? And you're sure that General Kanzler, will not be able to defend the city? And are you sure, that there will be no foreign interventions? No, listen to me, it will happen like three years ago, at the time of Garibaldi. you know what happened to me yesterday? They called me and warned me: At the first false step, at the first sign of conspiracy, we'll throw you in jail! See? And you blessed woman come to me to say... Good luck! But remember one thing, that when liberation occurs, do not you dare go around, with bracelets, cockades and tricolor flags. If you want to go back home, safe. You got it! Right? Madam, are you looking for the antique dealer? Yes. He closed, he is not there, he went to Genzano. you know he has the villa, you understand with current times! - Thank you. - You are welcome. Ave Maria grace... Holy Mary mother of God... Teresa Parenti is here! Mr. Marquis Mrs. Marquise Teresa Parenti is here. No Torquato, we're not in town, we do not even know when we'll come back, sorry. Hail Mary full of grace... Mr. Marquis is out of Rome. I had already understood this, but when is he coming back? In a month or two who knows! I understood. Thank you, thank you very much. Well, today I do not understand what is happening. Augusto Parenti, the politicians, there is ferment. - They are all agitated. - Yes, it's true. You think? Actually I think that .. So we chose this choir because it's a revolutionary choir and what it says "May the lion of Castille rise, from the work of... and a choir of Maestro Giuseppe Verdi. Giuseppe Verdi is a great patriot, guys! The melody is very simple, it goes Yes, yes, I remember it, but the lyrics? The lyrics go: - What? - Of Castille. Castille is a region of Spain there was a war there too. It's a different situation but you understand, all right! So, may the lion of Castille wake up! May the lion of Castille wake up and of Iberia, every mountain, every lido, Every what? Lido, lido is like saying, the beach, the beach, right? Of course, the beach. Yes, because even there they have the sea! And of Iberia, every mountain every beach, here you form. Guys be careful, because here form, is three words. Here you form. Which would mean, form the echo. I mean, a poetic thing. That would be like a great voice, the voice of the people! Here is the symbol of the lion, understand? - In conclusion. - The lions would be us! So we, all together, all united, as a mass, - we make a big roar! - The roar of the lion! here you form the tremendous roar, Like a day against the Moors oppressors. - Yes. - Why the Moors? in Spain instead of priests, they had monks. And we have roaches! And it's symbolic! I mean, the important thing is to stick with the symbol, did you understand guys? One thing all together, all united. It is the roar of the lion! The roar of the lion. All together here you form! - here you form. Guys come on, professor, go over it a bit. Come on guys, let's go! Let's start again. May the lion of Castille wake up. Guys, how are you? So, so. Augusto, it's going well, if you want to hear. Forget it, I trust you, but keep practicing. - What do you want? - Look, at the end you know where the choir goes: Iberia will be full of heroes from the wild redeemed it will be? He says that wild means the Moors, but I think it's wrong. Savage comes from Serbian, which means, But it seemed to me that the Moors had .. The important thing is that we sing. Of course, all together. Come on guys, come on! - Wait for me to give you the signal. - Move, move! - Come on! - And then all together! Come on let's go! Come on! Move! Move! Where are you going, come on! And now what are you doing, why did you stop? And now it's enough! Stronger! Louder! Stop it! I said stop! Stop it, do you understand? Stop it! You cannot stop me! You cannot stop us anymore! Got it? Sing! Sing! I can't bear it anymore! Everything has become difficult! To buy the bread you have to queue! To buy coal, the same! Then milk does not come anymore. It takes patience. Patience, patience. Here it is! Give me what you want. If I give it to you Saturday? It's the same? You know my husband, Mr. Anselmo, Well, it's not the same but... Thank you Mr Anselmo, thank you. - Good morning Mr Anselmo. - Good morning. It's good to see you again. How are you? So, so. I came to give you some news. Ah! News that you'll like. Nino is back. I did not hear you. Nino Colasanti has arrived! Mrs. Teresa, I had a disease. And I can't hear from this ear anymore. If you come to ask me how the work goes, I'm fine with it. And do you know why? Because everyone has shoes. Priests, children, soldiers, whores, spies, popes, French. They told me, that even the Piemontese wear shoes. I have learned at my expense, not to look at those who come to me. I look at their feet! And do you know what I found out? That the feet are all the same. As you wish, Mr. Anselmo. As you please. Good morning, good morning Mrs. Teresa! Can I help you? I need to talk with you. Maria. come here! What? It's with you that I have to talk. - Now? - Go downstairs please. Those Quartaroli arrived from Genzano, go, go check! All right. I know everything. But on us, on my husband, do not count Ms. Teresa! He must tell me! He's in bad shape. He does not sleep anymore. He's damned. I understand. Augusto had said it! How can he travel around Rome now! He's always inside the shop, just drinking. He doesn't speak but I prefer it that way. Better that way than in jail! Mrs. Teresa things change everything changes. As you please. Stay in peace. Mrs. Teresa wait. - Remo, it is useless. - Leave it. Mrs. Teresa, come, for a moment. Listen to me, I must know one thing. But look, you have to tell me the truth, the truth! What did Augusto say when he heard that I gave up? Eh, what did he say? Nothing. There was nothing to say. He understood! After all, everyone makes his own choices, right? Poor guy he said, yes, poor Bezzi! Remo? Leave me alone! Listen Teresa, I wanted to tell you, that when when you go to Augusto, when you see him again, tell him that Bezzi is so scared, so scared. At night, I still dream of jail, I still dream of it! However, inside, I'm still the same. Just tell me what should be done I will try! If you help me, I'll try! I'll try. Now I take these leeches off you, and then, Friar! They tell me that you are better than priests, but I do not believe it, anyway now, from man to man, friar help me. I have to stay here. Did you understand? My son, you are sick! You have sick blood, and in Velletri there is a Capuchin friar who works miracles! And you were transferred to the Velletri prison. No, no, not Velletri no! No, no. I have to stay here in Rome. Friar I must stay in Rome, when the time will come! Don't you understand? Eh? My son, it is for your health! And then it does not depend on me I do not count anything, I can only pray for you. Pray? No, no I have to stay here! Let me die here, Keep calm. - Friar I do not want to die in Velletri! I can't die in Velletri. Did you understand? Friar, help me .. I am, unmovable! Yes, I am fixed! but how did it happen? But what should I say! They did everything by themselves! Of course, when the disorder started, I had to intervene! What could we do? They are fanatical. I know that, after all, they're good people. I also know his wife! He must stay here. He's unmovable. It is truly impassable. Tell me! Do not make me die in Velletri! Do not make me die in Velletri. Maria, read that for me! I can't see. Notification, any individual, non-military, to be found armed, will be immediately submitted to the judgment of the war council. Numerous gatherings are also prohibited. The general commander to the troops, Ganzler. Very good! Unbelievable! You can't live anymore! And these want to wage war by force, then! What are you doing? Madam, the horses fall down. Main roads must be of dirt! These are the orders! well, let's organize the passages. You, you and you, come on. It's all OK. You can do it Teresa. Do not worry, at Porta Metronia they always see me pass by with chicory. Goodbye Teresa, good luck! - See you later! Where did you put the ampoules? - There. - No you stay still, I'll do it myself. You light the candles. I'll take care of it. Don Aldo? Excuse me. Ah! I must confess. Ah well. I have something to do, I am preparing for the first mass. Take a seat for two minutes and then I'll be there. No don Aldo, no, right away. I'm in a hurry. Hurry? To confess? Don Aldo, I have a weight here. go to the sacristy, then I'll call you. yes, I have a weight here and I absolutely have to get rid of it. Tell me. Don Aldo, I lied to you. I cheated, did you understand? Yes I understand. I understood, but above all I understood, you want to tell me something, obliging to the bond of confession! - Is that so? - Also. Mrs. Teresa, what malice is there? Let's go. Praised be Jesus Christ. Always be praised. Don Aldo, I tricked you. What shall I do, I betrayed you. - Because that evening... - Which evening? That night you came to my house I had already told myself, if Don Aldo wants me to send my child to the seminary, this time I'll do it. And we had to push it. but what could I do? - What you are doing, confess. - Now I regret it, though! I regret it, because I know I did something, that I did not have to do. That was not right, it was not right for me, for you. It was not right for my husband, for Mario, for anyone! I understood. But there was another thing you wanted to tell me, right? Say it, come on. The other thing is that, I have a house full of weapons! What? Holy Virgin Teresa, why? Because I had to do it. - But do you understand the danger? - I had to do it. No, look. So now I ask you, if anything should happen to me, you must swear to me, Don Aldo, that Mario will never be hurt! you understand that I can only rely on you. Swear it to me! - Yes. - I rely on you! Yes. what does it say, can you read that? Yes. Romans, the bloodless unbelievers, the murderers of women and children, the Piemontese are at the gates of Rome. Anyone who cares about the fate of the sacred city, enroll in the civic guard, and wield arms. Go to hell! Here, take this! Silence, silence! What's up? Be careful! Shut up. They're gone. Go back to your guard post! Hurry up. Come on, let's move. You go to the boys. - Nino! - Teresa! What will happen? They say that General Kanzler, and the Pope, decided for the resistance. That will be a long, terrible siege! It will be the will of God Teresa! Rome will be Italian! We will meet again very soon, I assure you. In Rome there is nothing to do! And we join the Piemontese troops! You never get discouraged, don't you? They should all be like you, and like Augusto. And instead we are not capable of anything! They should all be like you, Teresa. No, no, no. You're wrong, I'm not worth anything! Did I ever tell you about Mario? - Mario? - I did not have the courage to tell you. Mario, my son, son of Augusto Parenti, is in the seminary. Seminary? I sent him to the seminary. I sold my son to the priests, because I couldn't do it anymore, alone. Sold, what big words! Do not torment yourself! You sent him to the best school! I studied at the priests' too, do you know? Really, I'm serious! You did well. Very well. I did not have the courage to say it to Augusto. And it was right. Where he is now, he would not understand. Nino? It's time, we're ready. Yes, I'll come. Well, I have to go. Tell Augusto, he is with us. all right. Bye Nino and see you soon! Here we go. Let's go. See you soon Teresa! Come on, come on. Bye. Lord have mercy. And here kneeling at your feet, we pray you with humility, so that in your infinite mercy, you save the city you have chosen, at the chair of Christ. Lord have mercy! In this grave hour, for our Holy Mother church, Lord have mercy! unfair and hostile people threaten your righteous children. Lord have mercy! A Catholic king forgot his faith, opened fire against the Supreme Pontiff, your vicar on earth... Lord have mercy! Let's pray, for the intentions of the Supreme Pontiff, let us raise our fervent prayer, to the throne of the blessed virgin Mary. let us recite the holy rosary. Ave Maria... But look at the hustle and bustle of kids! Little boys? Little boys? What is happening? Nothing, what are you afraid of? But they came in, did you see them? - Yes. - What do they look like? They are many and they are strong! Gaetano come up, your father is looking for you all over Rome! Dad is at Porta Pia! The Piemontese arrived, and one gave me this! And what do the Piemontese look like? They are tall, they are two meters tall! Are they shooting? No, they do not shoot anymore! What about our men? What are they doing? Who? Zampisti, papalini, they are fearful! But we do not have the flag, we lost it! Nothing will change, the rags are always in the air! - The Piemontese, cool! - Shut up, you're crazy! It's the end!

Augusto! How are you, my son? I'm fine. Leave me alone! - And let's go, come on! - Leave me alone! - I want to kill him! - Augusto! I want to kill at least one! These shitheads! Augusto Augusto Augusto Augusto Augusto Augusto We were right. I would have paid, Yes, all right. - You'll make it. - Yes.

Yes, two fires, fine. Then there was, the flee of the guards. Bastards! So we, we have pulled out all the flags! Rome is full of flags! And the bells, the bells. Before those were ringing for the dead, but then all the children of Rome went up, And they started ringing and ringing! Augusto Did you hear the bells? - Did you hear the bells? - Yes. Now, I hear them now. Now, I hear them now, now, - Mariuccio! - Yes, dad! You are lucky. How many beautiful things you'll see! - Yes. - You understand that, don't you? How many things you will see!
