What did he say? I should try harder to like it. I told him I hate broccoli, but I understand I have to eat it anyway because it's good for me. And that arithmetic is just as bad as broccoli, even though it's not a vegetable. Were you polite? Of course, Daddy. I don't like your mustache. You don't? It makes you look sort of dumb. It scratches and smells like soup. What's wrong? Dogs aren't allowed here. Dogs aren't allowed? This is a park, isn't it? It's the law, sir. No dogs here. No dogs in the park? Then where are they supposed to go? I don't know. I don't make the laws. But if you don't leave, I'll have to fine you. Miss! Your shoelace is undone. Christ, they pave over everything except a tiny park, and, pow, no animals! You some Nazi? Do you shoot pigeons too? Thanks! Name, please? My name? Think I'm gonna tell you my name, you retard? Who do you think you are? Think you're a cop? Ok, I'm gonna leave now, cause I have to, understand? But if I ever see your stinking face or cap or pencil, I'll give you more than a fine! Call the daycare! I'm going to be late. Madame? Madame, can you hear me? Anybody have a cell phone? Someone called. Madame, try not to move, ok? Her chest is bleeding. I can see that! I'm just pointing out that it's bleeding. I know. Could you shut up? Let's be polite. I'm sorry, lady. I'm sorry! - We shouldn't touch her. - I'm not touching her! - I'm just trying to help. - So am I. You're out of your minds! You're fucking sick! Christ! My granddaughter's waiting... What's your granddaughter's name? My granddaughter's name is Sandra. Her name is Sandra Desrosiers. Call the daycare. I'll call them. I'm late. What's the name of the daycare? My granddaughter... It must be something. - What? - Saying goodbye to your kid. Knowing you won't see him again. What do you tell him? He's going to watch the tape all his life. You have to find something smart to say. But you can't. It's beyond words. You have a son, right? Jean-Fran鏾is, my little man. Sometimes I think that, like it or not, one day I'll be looking at him... It'll be the last time I see him. I probably won't know, but the last time... It doesn't compute. I can't get my head... I can't accept it. It's completely... What the hell's going on? A big accident. They say someone died. What's wrong, baby? What happened? Just hold me. Just hold me, without talking. Just for a few minutes. As long as you want. Come. Come. - I love you, baby. - I love you. I love you. A super CHOW... Fuck off. He was sitting there. Maybe they won't come today. Did she say what was wrong? No, she doesn't want to talk about it yet. She's been weird since the finger. Did you get the toilet fixed? You know she loves you. Sometimes she overreacts. This time it's different. She's half-there, half-gone. - I don't know what it is. - Why not ask her? She doesn't want to talk. And I have a lot going on too. Excuse me, sir! Dogs aren't allowed in the park! Goddamit! What is your fucking problem? Is it your job to piss people off? Are you stalking me, asshole? You in love? Wanna dance? Want my fucking number? What? What's wrong? You jerk. He'll call the cops. We have to go. So? They're not here, we have to come back anyway. You're such a pain! - Why? - You're such a pain! I'm having problems with Suzie and all you can do is throw sticks at people. I'm being serious and you throw sticks at someone who's... wearing a cap! So what? So nothing, shit! Look at us, two clowns in a park. Two goddamn clowns! - Speak for yourself. - I'm fed up! Come, puss. Hi. Philipe Chevalier's expecting me. He told me. Go on up, the rehearsal must be over. You say one thing and then the opposite. I don't know where I stand. You're so angry, it feels like your eyes are daggers. Maybe you're the problem. You make up stories so you can believe I still love you. Then why is hate in your eyes? It's not hate you see in my eyes, it's lack of love. You're used to seeing love in my eyes, but now that's gone. That's all, it's just that. - You're not mad at me? - Not anymore. - You're sure? - Yes. Okay. Sorry, I guess it was just me. Yes, it's just you. Yup, it's just me. - You ok? - Yeah, I'm ok. See you later. See you. You're here? I didn't notice. You ok? Fine. I came in, but didn't want to interrupt. I understand. - You heard it all? - Some of it. You shouldn't worry, you're really good. Well, that's my opinion. It was like... It was so real, I felt shy watching. What do you mean? What you were playing there, the scene. No, hold on a second. That wasn't a scene, that was real. I mean, the woman you saw is my ex-girlfriend. She's an actress, but we weren't acting. I'm sorry, I was sitting there. No wonder you liked it! - How stupid of me. - Stop it. You saw a good show. I'm so sorry! C'mon, let's get to work. Let's do it again. Remember, get into the scene. All he has left, all he can leave behind, is a little message on a videotape. Take your time. Not during the scene, but before. Don't try to be good. Don't try to be anything. Just try to be him. To see what he sees. To think what he thinks. His little boy. See his boy. You're my love. My little boy. You can't answer, Dad's in the machine, in the TV. Do you want to talk? There's too much going on in my head. Give me a little time. Look both ways, ok? Wait here a sec. Yeah, but... Just wait here. Can I help you? You've a lovely little girl. Thank you, but... can I help you? Someone paid me to tell you if you keep on seeing her, your legs will be broken. Don't run away, It's not me. I won't hurt you. But someone else will. I don't understand. Are you threatening me? I have a contract, but I won't do it. Did my wife pay you? I don't know her. I don't even know your name. All I can say is, change park. This one's too hot. Was it my father-in-law? Well? I can't take it. I can't do this anymore. I'm quitting. What about me? What am I supposed to do? Whatever you want. You can抰 just quit like that. It was right here, at the corner. The car came from here. Did they arrest the guy? I don't know. His father'd had a heart attack. He ran a red light. I'd prefer if he'd been some dickhead. I'm alive, and I have a little baby in my tummy. Sometimes I feel like... I feel so tiny. It's like life is tossing me around. I feel like a leaf. Life is a mystery. But grownups often forget that. If life isn't mysterious, you're playing it too safe. Stop. Look me in the eyes, Louis. Look at me, stay in the mood. - At you? - Keep going! - Be proud. - No, start over. Be proud... No, talk to your little boy. - But I see you. - See your kid in my eyes. - Always be proud. - I can't feel it. Take your time and give it to me. Be proud. Always be proud. Don't let others step on you. Never stop playing. And above all, above all, love, my baby. I love you beyond all words. Tell me about your experience, Louis. When I was a kid, I was wild about movies. Mom and I went all the time. She loved movies. She was crazy about Gregory Peck. She had taste. That's it, I was wild about movies and actors. I'd act out scenes at home alone. Scenes from films and plays. I knew every line in the Godfather. But only when I was alone. So that's it. I never tried to become an actor. The part of town I'm from, things can get rough, and I'm good at getting rough. I became a runner. I beat up people who owe money and won't pay. A collector, that's me. Or, that was me. I never stopped acting out scenes alone at home. And nobody in your life knows? Well, there's you, Gis鑜e, my cousin, from the agency. Your girlfriend? - Why not? - Who knows? I was afraid she'd laugh at me. So all your life you beat people up? Glad we didn't meet before! Look, Louis. I don't know much about life. But I know actors. And you're one. If you're half this good at the audition, I guarantee she'll let you meet the director. What time tomorrow? At 11. I'll think of you. Break a leg. - Thanks. - You say ok, not thanks. Then ok for everything. Try to sleep tonight. Don't chase after emotion. Let it come. Just get out of its way. Behold the man. You ok? I'm ok. - And you? - Sure. Loads of work. Feeling alright? Are you ready? Yeah, I think so. Come here a second. Let me see. You look gorgeous. You'll do fine. Want some water? I'll see if she's ready. Remember when we were kids? You copped a kiss by imitating Humphrey Bogart. Do the same now. We're ready for you. Come in. Dominique, this is Louis. Hello, Louis. - Pleased to meet you. - Hello. How are you? Any questions, is there anything you'd like to know? Any explanations? You sure? Then let's start. If you'd face the camera... Please identify yourself. Pardon? Your name. Look at the camera and say your name. Louis Tremblay. Thank you. When you're ready. Take your time. There's no rush. Don't forget, you're playing. It's just a game. It's what kids do. You're my love, my little boy. You can't answer. Dad's in the machine, the TV. I don't know how... Shit! Look. By now you know that Dad's gone. I know you don't know why. I know it's not easy to understand, but... I'd like the tropical salad and a bottle of mineral water, please. And bring me a goat cheese poutine too. But no sun-dried tomatoes in the poutine. No tomatoes. And the sauce on the side. Are you... expecting a baby? Yes. Is it mine? Yes. I quit my job. I can't take it. I can't collect anymore. I have to see Joan... but I promise, no more fingers! Do you want us... Want us to be a family? I saw his last show. God it was boring! Philipe Chevalier... He can't act. He never could and he never will. Some people like him. Some people like McDonald's, doesn't mean it's good. He's a ham. He's stale. He's never believable. And he's always playing the same part, badly. So why are you here? Morbid curiosity. Watch out! What for? My foot. You just stepped on my foot. Oh, that? No, I can't watch out for that! Do you mind? We're all pimping for somebody, Billie. Mostly for ourselves. Bastard! Scumbag! Quitter! We sell our ass to convince ourselves it's still ours. To convince ourselves it's worth more than other people's. We sit there, numb, on our ass, no soul, nothing left to defend. Then we start getting bored. Do you remember? As kids, we never were. Our ass was ours alone. We owned ourselves. We could be who we wanted. We could do it. We had favorite colors. You say I'd never have killed the cat as a kid. But I would have, because I had no choice. That's enough! The only difference is, back then I would've buried it. I'd have said a prayer. And I'd have wept for a week. But now I didn't think twice. I couldn't care less about cats now, Billie. But I do care about you, Billie. I care about you, Billie. You're the only part I've kept of myself. Even now, I'm dying and all I can think about is how good you smell. You smell so good. Like a young girl. - You're the best! - Thank you! - Did you like it? - It was awesome! I haven't danced like that in ages. I gotta pee. I have to talk to you. - I gotta pee. - Sit down a minute. I'm thrilled about what's happening to you. Really. It's amazing. I'm so glad. It's all thanks to you. I don't mean the audition. I wanted to say... I wanted to say, I'm putting on a play next year. I've a part for you. A small one, but it's a start. Are you serious? I'll tell you after. Wait, are you really serious? Yes, I'm serious. Go pee and we'll talk. You're serious? Go pee before I change my mind! Today's the anniversary of my dad's death. It's been four years. He sat on the sofa, took his gun, and stuck it in his mouth. I was lucky. I was in the next room. Can I get up? And zip my pants? What's your name? What do you want, Sarah? $16,000. What? Do you have $16,000 on you? Then you can't help me. Four years ago you beat up my dad for $16,000. You broke his jaw, broke his nose, he lost an eye. Then he lost his job, his friends, my mom. He shot himself in the head. He was a nice guy. You'd have liked him. This won't bring him back. I know that. I'm not crazy. Listen to me. You don't want this. I can see it in your eyes. Think it over. Think it over real good. If you do this, you'll always regret it. I know. I realize that. That's the worst part. Hello, Philipe Chevalier. Because it's been 4 years. You always call on the day he died. And I have caller ID. Yeah, I'm ok. I mean, I think about it a lot, but I'm ok. He's great. He's playing in the living room. Absolutely, Philipe. He misses you. He'd love that, for sure. How's your show going? The reviews are great, anyway. Say your name. Look at the camera and say your name. Thank you. When you're ready. You're my love, my little boy. You can't answer me, baby. Dad's in the machine, the TV. I don't know how... Shit! Look. By now you know that Dad's gone. But not why. It's hard to explain. Listen to me, my love. I just want to say how beautiful you are. How magnificent. The only reason I ever thought God might exist. How much I envy you too. I envy you all that awaits you, all the magic. The campfires and starry skies. French fries - so great when you're a kid... The end of school, when the bell rings and summer's yours. Shit! Your first french kiss. The smells... Miniskirts. Fall. All the magic. Take it, baby. Take it and keep it! Cherish it! Life is a mystery. But grownups often forget that. If life isn't mysterious, you're playing it too safe. Okay... Be proud. Always be proud. Don't let others step on you. Never stop playing. And love, my baby. Above all, above all, love. I love you. Beyond words. for my son Translation: Robert Gray, Kinograph DVD captioning: CNST, Montreal
