Watch each other's back. - [Derrick] Your back is watched. - Let's do this. (doors slamming) (glum music) (guys in white chattering) - What you looking for? - My little boy, what you working with? - You all the police? - Come on man, we look like cops, dog? - Y'all look like police. - Come on man, we ain't no police. - All right, hold on. Go get that. - Y'all got some good herb, right? - Top shelf, man. - Okay, okay, I'ma check you out, I'ma check you out. Couple guys told me about you. We ain't just over here for nothing. You know I did, you know? - You got heat, man? - As a matter of fact, I do. - Hey, this that nigga we got the other day, yo! (gun firing) (intense music) (guns firing) - [Derrick] Shit, shit! Come on man, come on! Fuck is wrong with you? (gun firing) - [Savon Voiceover] It seems the same dream haunts me. You would think after eight years I would have forgave myself, but apparently, the past won't forgive me. My name is Savon. And I'll be the first to admit that I haven't always done the right things to get where I am. But this is dog eat dog world. Sometimes you had to prove you were the biggest dog. But hey, that was back in the day. Today, I'm a changed man. The good book says God works in mysterious ways. So maybe he's paying me back for all the dirt I did by making me a diabetic. 'Cause Lord knows I hate needles. I guess one thing that comes from me being diabetic is you learn to appreciate life. It's just a shame to have this much money and have to lose your health to realize. It's funny how everybody equates happiness with money. But to me, happiness is Neesy. She literally saved my life. And everyday I try to show my appreciation for her. - You got a busy day today? - [Savon] Yeah I got that closing with Cash today. - [Denise] Mmm, finally bringing Cash here to the real estate game, huh? - Yeah, I was tired of seeing him going in and out of jail all the time. You know after he could maybe get a change of pace, get him off those streets. - Mhmm, like I did you? - Yeah, like you did me. - I know. - So why you asking? - No reason special, I was just thinking maybe we could go to a movie or something. - [Savon] Okay, on one condition. - Mmm, what's that? - Ew, y'all nasty. - Ooh, I told you, little cheater, it's my house. - Morning, DJ. - Good morning, Aunt Denise. Good morning Uncle Savon. - Good morning Uncle Savon. - Aunt Denise, do you know when my mother's coming? - Oh, she gonna be here any minute, sweety. Why you got your nose all turned up at the little boy, sore loser? - Neesy, I won that video game, you know that. - Oh baby, all I know is that you lost. Bad. - Only reason I be losing 'cause he got them game codes. - I only know L1 five four. - See? I only know L1 five four. That's why he be cheating, I told you, up in them games. See, me and you, without them codes, I'ma tell y'all five bucks. - Bet then. - Bet then, bet then. I ain't scared of you. - Okay, children. That's enough. - What's up? - Yo, shut up. - Good morning. - Oh, hey, sis. - Baby, go get your things so we can go. I was speaking to both of y'all. - Morning. - That's better. - Kill anybody today? - No luck. None of your thug friends were out last night. - Oh, leave my baby alone. - Ugh, take it upstairs. Don't nobody wanna see all that. - I'ma tell you like I told your little cheating son. This is my house. - Hey sis, you're moving to days now, right? - Yeah. Last night was my last night, thank God! - Ooh yeah, thank God. That mean we ain't gotta keep DJ no more. - Uh, no. - Baby. - Y'all still can keep him. 'Cause now that I'm on days I can watch you on the streets. Catch you doing something wrong, and I'ma lock you up. - Angie, why you always after me? I treat you good, don't I baby? - Yeah, okay. - Listen, if there's one thing I can say I taught your sister, - Which is? - Never let 'em see you sweat. - Never let 'em see you sweat? What the hell is that, a deodorant commercial? - No, it's a phrase you need to try. Maybe you should live by it too, officer. - Get on my nerves. - Oh, no you ain't gotta listen to him. (tense music) Oh baby. I could teach you the code L1 five four two if you want me to. - You think about what we talked about? - What's wrong with you? - Neese, I'm just ready to start living our life. Look, babe, I wanna go on some cruises, take flights around the world, something. Look, I got a lot of money saved up and I want us to enjoy it together. All right, before we run out of time. And the time is now, baby. - Baby, come on, we have so much time to be together. Now, come on? You remember when you were out on the streets? - Come on. - No, no, no, come on, let me finish. And I waited for you, right? You were still out there hustlin', doing your thing, I waited. Now I need you to wait for me to be ready, okay? Okay? - All right. I gotta go meet Cash, so. - Oh, okay, well what about tonight? - I'll just call you later on and let you know what's up. - (scoffs) Wow. (tense music) - There they are right there. - Yeah. They just left the bank. A'ight. Got it, holla. - So how you feel about your first closing? - Man, that took a long time, V. - Yeah it's 'cause the people had they paperwork in order, man. But the good thing is, you got the check. - Yeah, buddy. (chuckling) I can't wait for the next one now. - For sure. This is for you. - Yes! - What's that, what you looking at the check like that for, is that a problem? - Come on man, I thought we agreed on more than this? - We agreed on one fourth. Now I'ma calculate, I do this shit all the time. Don't start with me, Cash. - Look, I know, man. I ain't tripping and nothing. It's just that I thought you was gonna help a brother out. I mean, seeing as though this is my first piece of property, V. - Help you out? I am helping you out. Cash, you're putting in three Gs for the rehab. I gave you 25 plus three. How many you be catching on walking around here with 28K in they pocket? - I know, I know. I mean, but it's just that I thought you was just gonna go half with me. Also man, it's my birthday. - It's your birthday? You got a birthday five months ago, didn't you? - [Cash] Look man, I feel what you're saying.. - Man, look, we're gonna have plenty more property rehab. And once you learn the ropes you're gonna make your own money, get your own checks without me, aight? - Aight. Hey look, I got an idea. - What you talking about, man? 'Cause I know you, I gotta- - Come on, man, you always talking about you got something to do. Come kick it with your boy. Let's celebrate, let's have a drink. Please, on me. - What you talking about? - (laughing) Trust me. - Oh I know I'ma regret this.

Your own motherfucking husband tell you to pay the money and you still don't pay?! We kidnapped the wrong motherfucker. We should have kidnapped your stupid ass! Fuck! - Hello? - All right, $100,000, all right? $100,000! - She said she'll give us $100,000. - Hell no, fuck that! - This ain't no motherfuckin' negotiation. We said $500,000 and nothing less. - Denise, now how you gonna go on and do something like that, huh? How would you feel if these fools just kill him, huh? Or maybe you just want his money. (slapping) - Fuck you, Cash! All right, fuck you! I want my husband home! All right, I can't even believe you would say anything to me like that! - Look. I'm sorry. You know maybe I feel this way because he's been my friend longer than he's been your husband. Let's just try to get this money so we can get him out. (tense music) - Talked to the boss, he said if we don't get what we want, go ahead and kill him. - You hear that big playa? If your little wifey don't be here we'll come dance real soon, I get to blow your motherfucking head off. I'm going upstairs. Keep an eye on this bitch ass nigger. - Hello? Hey. Sis, what's wrong with you? - They got him. They got Savon. They kidnapped him. - Are you serious? DJ, go upstairs. - Look, I know I didn't call you. All right, but I know how you get. - But I'm a cop, Denise. Okay, so what do they want? - They want everything. Yeah, half a million dollars. - Look, Savon told her where the money was. - You talked to Savon? And he told you to pay 'em? - Yeah! But for some odd reason she wants to continue to play this little cat and mouse games with the kidnappers! - So what do you expect her to do? - What are you talking about, Angela? I expect her to pay the money so we can get him home as soon as possible! - Well I think we should call the police! I know some officers who can help us with this! - I don't think we need to do that. I can't do that! - [Angela] So what are you gonna do? - I don't know! Okay, I don't know! - Okay, look. It's been a long day and you still got on your work clothes. Let's just go upstairs so you can freshen up a little bit. Hopefully it'll help you think a little better. Okay? - Hey, look. (tense music) - Relax, man, it's me. I got a question for you. Why won't your wife pay, man? (Savon coughing) Whoah, breathe, breathe, homie, breathe, breathe. Breathe, come on. Come on, relax, breathe. You know, man, I know this ain't the most comfortable place, but, you need to know, man, it wasn't supposed to go down like this. We were supposed to grab you, get the money and have you back at home chillin with your wife. Just, shit got messed up. - Why can't y'all earn your money like decent people? - Hey, come on man, look, don't take it like that. It's just, somebody told us you had loot. Said if we grabbed you, that your peoples will pay. But obviously, your wife won't pay. - You still taking other people money? Why can't y'all work? Your own money. - You got a point there. Maybe that's why this shit won't work out. Look, man. You think your wife should pay? - Y'all gonna get your money. Y'all gonna get your money. So just spare me the small talk. - No, you're taking it the wrong way. But look. I didn't get into this, man, to hurt anybody. I got into it just to get some paper, man, just to get some money. That's all I needed. Wasn't supposed to wind up like this. - Yeah, money, money, money. Shit crazy. - When you out here on the streets, man, you gotta support a family, you gonna do what you gotta do. It's all about supporting the family, man, ain't nothing going on out here. And man, I'm doing what I gotta do. - [Savon] Why don't you get a job? - Ain't you the self-righteous bastard. (scoffing) Dude. Don't talk to me about getting no job. (sighing) You know, I got a college degree? I got a college degree. And I can't find a fucking job. Let me tell you, you wanna know why I'm doing this? The only reason I'm doing this is for my son. My son. Nigga, I got a son that's fucking dying! Motherfucking college degree. Can't even get a goddamn job. My son, man, if I don't get this money my fucking son is gonna die. I don't give a fuck about you or none of them other motherfuckers. - Just spare me the jack, you fucking story. - Yeah I don't expect you to understand. You ain't got no kids. You don't know what it's like to be out here trying to support a family, do you? Do you? Let me tell you something. When the opportunity comes to make some money, and your son is laying on a deathbed, nigga, you there. (tense music) - [Angela] So when they call, do you see the number on the caller ID? - No, it just comes up unavailable. - [Angela] Girl, I swear I think you should just go ahead and pay 'em. - No, I don't think so. Okay, 'cause he's talking about things like a baby's room, and look under pictures and things like that. - [Angela] Yeah, and? - Well we don't have a baby's room so it doesn't make sense. That's why I don't think he really wants me to pay them. - [Angela] Girl, I swear I think you should just go ahead and call the police and let us handle it. - Well no, I can handle it. I can handle it! - Never let 'em see you sweat. - All right, you're right. You're right. - Right, let's go. - Okay, look, I'll just call you back, all right? Aight Denise, so what's up? - [Denise] I'm ready. - Okay, so when are we gonna give them the money? - When they call back, okay? And when they do, I'm gonna ask them to take the $100,000. - Okay, but they're not. And if they were, they would have said yes already. I mean, come on, Denise, you can't continue to play games with these cats. You don't know what they're capable of doing. I do. - Cash, why are you on her about giving up the money? - Because, Angela, we can't continue to be playing these games. I mean, come on, they're talking about a half a million dollars. She talking about giving them a hundred grand! - So? And if she was only talking about giving up five dollars you should be supporting her! She going through enough, she don't need this shit! - I mean, what are you talking about, I am supporting her! That's why I'm telling her. She can't just give them a hundred grand! - So why don't you put up the difference then? 'Cause I don't see you talking about putting up shit! And you supposed to be his best friend. (phone ringing) - Hello? - Look, lady, last chance. What do you wanna do? - 100,000. All right, that's it. I'd rather put half a million in the streets for your asses. - I thought you loved this man. I thought you'd do anything for him. - Fuck this bitch! - Whoah, whoah, come on man, calm down. - [Gutta] This bitch still playing ransom games? - Whoah, lady, he has a gun to your husband's head. Please, lady, tell me something. I can't stop him. Now, come on man, calm down! - Hold on, I'm about to blow this motherfucker head off, she better tell us something. - Lady, he's gonna shoot your husband. I cannot stop him this time. Tell me something. He's about to kill your husband! Tell me something! Come on man, calm down! - Ma, Ma, Ma, Ma! I just beat the game again! - Baby, go back upstairs, that's fine. - But Ma, I just beat the game I beat Uncle Savon with. - Baby, that's fine. Go back upstairs now. - Aw, man. - Okay. Okay, I'll do it. - [Gregory] Hold, man, she's gonna pay, she's gonna pay. Hold on. - Under one condition. You ask my husband for the code. - She's talking about some code, man. What, what, what? What's the code, man? - [Gutta] What the fuck's going on? - What's the code? - What's the code, nigga? - He knows it. Okay, he knows it. You get that, I'll get you your money. - [Gregory] Tell me the code, man, come on! - [Savon Voiceover] See that? That's why I love her. They hear code and think money. But what I hear is yes or no. - L, one five four. - What is it, say it again? - L one five four. - L one five four, you got it? - Okay. I'll get your money together, just, I need like 20 minutes. - No, you got 10 minutes. - Shit! - I thought that bitch would break. - That's it. (sighing) (sighing) Well man, I got some candy for you, man. There was some upstairs. Hopefully this'll make you feel better. (sighing) Here, open your mouth, open your mouth. Dude. You got a hell of a woman, man. - You ain't gotta tell me what I got. - No man, don't take it like that, look. What I'm saying is that she kept it together. Man she's been holding this down the whole time. I just wish my girl was a little bit like that, man. I wish she could handle herself under pressure. - So I guess you'll all get your own get a nice cut of my money, huh? - Nah. I don't know what their cut is, man. All I know is that my piece, it'll be enough for me to help my son. Maybe get another start. That's all I need. - So. How'd you get involved in this anyway? You just don't seem like you built for this. - Oh, now you all inquisitive. (sighing) Well. A while ago, I was in the joint, man. Walked into a pharmacy, and I had a toy gun. I stuck the pharmacy up for some medicine. Yeah, it don't sound too smart, but I had to do what I had to do, man. My son was sick. It was the only way I could get the medicine. (sighing) But I didn't get the medicine. Instead, I got jail. But that's where I met this guy who had this plan about you. So he hooked me up on it, man. I mean, I was desperate, dude, for real. I mean I would have gave up my left arm just to get some money, man. Dude. But it wasn't supposed to be like this, man. Nobody was supposed to get hurt, man. (sighing) This shit is crazy, but, hey. - So let me ask you this. What you think gonna happen to me after? After they get my money? - Tell you the truth, dude? I don't think they want you alive. - So I'm dead anyway then. - Yeah, I'ma help you get out of here. (tense music) - [Angela] Neesy? - Yeah. I'm over here, come here. I'm gonna need you to help me move this thing over. Come on, one two. - You got it? I can't believe you got this much money in your basement. - Yeah, well. It was our living good money, but you know. Travel the world, put the kids in private school. - Now sis, I know this may be a shocker but when I was in the Police Academy, my mission was to take down as many drug dealers as I could. And I used to think that the drug deals were responsible for like all the crime on the streets. But I actually see it differently now that I actually knew one. Savon is really good to you. And y'all really do connect. Everything that you've done to this point had been amazing. - Thanks, girl, but for real, I just want my man home. - All right. - Okay? - Okay. - All right, so come on. - Come on, let me help you. - All right. - Got it? - Yeah. Let's go. (gun clacking) - [Star] Hey. - [Gutta] What the fuck are you doing? Go back upstairs! - What the hell is taking y'all so long? - [Gutta] Don't worry about what's taking us so long. We got this under control down here. And who the fuck told you to come here anyway? - Obviously, boss man told me to come down here and wait until the cell phone rings. - [Gutta] You know what, don't forget your role in all this. - I know my role in all this. - [Gutta] And what's your role? Giving my motherfucking pussy away? - Why, you want some? - [Gutta] Yo, I'm sick of leftovers. - [Star] Fuck you, Gutta. (phone ringing) - Hello? Hello? - Yes, hello? - Here's where I want you to drop off the money at. - All right. But listen, you should just talk to the person who's gonna do the actual drop. Please, please. - Hurry up, put him on. - Yeah. - Make sure you come alone. Go to Chinatown, Cermak. - Give me a pen. - Take a right. Proceed north until you get to an old bridge. - Right. - Go behind the abandoned warehouse and sit there until I contact you. - Okay. - You got a cell phone number? Give it to me. Got it. Leave now. - I'm on my way. - You don't want any backup? - No. I'ma bring him home, I promise. I promise. (tense music) - I think he's just nervous. (sighing) I don't trust his ass. Wait, I just thought about something. - What? - When you mentioned to dude over the phone that you were sending someone else to do the drop, how did he respond? - What do you mean? I don't know, what? - I mean, you just said that a man that they never talked to was handling the drop. - So? - So? Did he ask you was the man a friend? Did he ask you was the man a cop? Shit, did he ask you anything about Cashmere? - No, no, he didn't. - So when you told them that Cash was bringing the money, what did they exactly say? - He just said put him on the phone. - That don't surprise me. What did I tell you earlier? It's almost always somebody that you know. Think about it, Denise. Who knows what Savon has more than you and Cash? That's bullshit. I'm gonna go follow his ass. - All right. Just be careful, okay? - Sis, I'm a cop, remember? (tense music) (siren sounding) - [Cop] Man, get your hands out of your pockets and step over here. - [Bald Cop] Put your hands down. How you doing? - I'm fine, officer. - This your car? (phone ringing) Go ahead, you can answer. - I'm cool, man, it's just my girl. - [Cop] Hey partner, I'ma go run his plate. - Have you got a driver's license and proof of insurance? - Yes, in my glove compartment. - [Bald Cop] Go get it. (phone ringing) She really want to see you, huh? - I guess so. - Tell me something. Why you hanging around here? - Well you know, actually I just decided to stop over and take a piss. - Follow me. - I'm getting in the car for? - Follow me. Get in there. - [Cash] Why I gotta get in? - Because he says so! Now get your butt in the car! - What we got? - This car's registered to a Savon Wesley. - Who's that? - It's my best friend, man. I mean he helped me get the car. He always helps me. (phone ringing) - Best friend? Its insurance is in his name. Hey, run his license. - Okay. - [Cash] Look man, it's aight I can go now? - Look, calm down, sir. I'm just writing you a ticket for an expired sticker! - Look, I'm sick of hearing that phone. Answer it. - I'm cool. - Answer the fucking phone. - Yeah. - Dude, I've called you four times, man. You're not picking up your phone. What, you think this is a game? You think this is a joke? - Man, just calm down, aight? - Look, stay there. Somebody'll be there to pick up the money. You understand that? - Cool. - Step out. Follow instructions so you can get your license back. - [Cop] Take care of that sticker. - So we good? - Yeah, yeah, we good. Go get Gutta, tell him I said come in. - What's up, man? - Nigga, you're not authorized to ask me so many motherfucking questions. Do what I tell you. Get Gutta, now! - Ay. - Yo, it's me. Yeah, yeah, yep, yep. And the money coming, yes. It's all good on this thing over here. That's all I'm trying to tell you, so. From this point on, I mean you know that. It's all good, the money on its way. All right? Yeah. - What's taking so long? (tense music) - Hey, baby. - What's wrong? You're looking stressed out. - What are you doing here? Are you following me or something? - No. You must have forgot. I talked to you earlier, you say you were gonna be down here. - What? What are you talking about? I don't remember telling you nothing like that. Well look, anyway, baby, I'm trying to take care of some business right now, okay? I mean, now maybe we can hook up later on or something. - No. What's going on? - Business. So what I'ma need you to do is go home. I don't want you to get hurt. - Baby, look, I'm scared. - Scared of what? Look, everything is gonna be aight. But I just need you to get outta here. I need you to go home. - I'm scared. I really don't wanna do this. - Do what? - This. (silenced gun firing) Hello? Yeah, I did it. Yeah, and I got the money. Look, I want you to meet me on 4800 West. No, I'm not coming through that back door. I told you, I hate rats and it was a lot of rats the last time. Yeah, look, look. Listen, all right look, I'm on my way, all right? All right.

Look, I can't understand you. What's wrong? - Star, Star shot me. - No. Oh my god, oh my god. I know where she headed. She got the money. She headed 4800 West. - All right, all right, all right, just hold on, all right, you hold on, you hang in there. - I'm sorry, I'm sorry Denise. I promised. - Okay, you just hang on, I'ma do it. - I promised you I was gonna bring him. - Hello? No! No. (sobbing) (suspenseful music) Okay. Okay, DJ? - Whoah, hey, hey man, what you doing?

Okay, cool, I'ma let you in through the side door. - [Denise] It's gonna be all right. Let's go. (tense music) - The plan was not to kill nobody. - I was planning for these motherfuckers not to get in my way. - Who is that? - Hell has no fury like a woman scorned. - Ange? What are you doing? Why are you doing this? - Why? Fuck you, nigga! You know how long I've waited for this moment? - But you lied. How could you do this to your sister? - How could I? Have you forgotten that fucking fast? I was married once. I was pregnant. With DJ! Derrick's child, remember? Do you remember that night?! - You pregnant with my son? - We're gonna be okay! - Oh hell no, fuck that shit, man! - Savon, tell him not to go nowhere, please. - I have to go handle my business. - Yeah he gotta handle his business. - That's bullshit! You ain't gotta go nowhere! - Look, will you just calm down? Just let me go handle my business. - No, I'm not gonna calm down.

I begged Derrick not to leave. But your ass insisted! But if he had stayed, DJ would have a father right now! All this because he trusted you! He trusted you more than he trusted me! His own fucking wife! Then you have the nerve to go home without him! Telling me he was dead? That he was shot and killed? - I've apologized for that so many times. I'm sorry for what happened to Derrick. That's why I always tried to be a good role model for DJ. I know I made some mistakes, but, - That's not enough! That's not fucking enough! - [Savon] So what you want? - Your life. - Okay, listen. I need you to hide behind here. And just be quiet, okay, we'll come back for you, okay? - [DJ] Okay. - Okay, now just be quiet, be careful, real quiet, go, go, go. Shhh. I'll be back for you. (tense music) - [Angela] All this. Because he trusted you! He trusted you more than he trusted me! His own fucking wife! - Listen, you don't have to do this. - I'm sorry, Savon. But it gotta be this way. This way, it's even! And my sister and I can move on together and start a new life.

Some fucking money?! - Fuck the money! This is about you. This is about my revenge! Have you forgotten?! Have your bougie ass forgotten? Your husband is the reason why my husband is dead! - How can you say that, when me and Savon have just done everything we could for you and your child? How can you even say that? - I didn't need Savon! I didn't need Savon or his fucking money! (sobbing) I'm sorry, sis. But I gotta do what I gotta do. - So you gonna shoot me now. Your own flesh and blood? You gonna shoot me now?! - Angie, no! - [Denise] Oh my god! - Stop it, put the gun down, it's over. Put the gun down. - Denise, get away from him! Get away from him, Denise. Get away from him, I'm gonna shoot his ass! Get away from him. - Shoot him, Angela, and you shoot me. You shoot him, you shoot me. So shoot me, Angela, shoot me, please! - So now I gotta kill both of you? - No mama! No mommy, no! Please don't kil them. - [Gregory] Lady, put the gun down, please! - DJ, move back away, DJ. - Put the gun down, lady. (screeching) - Come on, sis, it don't have to be like this. - Please forgive me, forgive me! - No, come on Angela, you don't have to do. - Please forgive me. - [Gregory] No. No! - Come on. - Angela no! - No! (gun firing) - [Savon Voiceover] I wonder if he'll hate me once he finds out why this all happened. I know I let his mother down but I promise I won't let him down. Karma. People forget, but the streets never let you forget. But I still got unfinished business. (tense music) - I don't understand, baby. Isn't there something else the doctors can do? - Sweetheart, it's gonna be okay. Here, button your coat up, man, before you get cold. Catch a cold and be in there. - Don't worry about me. - But I worry about you. Hey, it'll be all right, sweety. Come on, stop crying. - [Man] There that nigga go right there. - [Man] Let's go. - All right? I worry about you. It'll be okay, they're doing all they can do. And you know, God has a way of working everything else through, all right? - You're so right, babe. - Oh, shit. - Relax. It's okay. (snapping) Go ahead, take it. It's all right. It's all right. I want you to take that as a token of my appreciation for everything you done for me and my family. I want you to take that money and get your son healthy. Show him a new way of life, show him something different from what we know. 'Cause once he know better, maybe he'll do better. And maybe we can break this vicious cycle, all right? It's okay, man.
