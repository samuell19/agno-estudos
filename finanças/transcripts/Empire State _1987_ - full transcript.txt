[screaming] OFF-SCREEN SPEAKER 1: What about her? Do we sort her out too? OFF-SCREEN SPEAKER 2: She don't know nothing. Just some old scrubber he picked up. Come on, let's get out of here. [tires screeching] VOICE GREETING (FROM INTERCOM): Welcome to Metropolis. Please take a seat. Someone will be with you shortly. [printer clatters] [SCREAMS AND GUNSHOT OVER BACKGROUND DANCE MUSIC] PUBLIC ADDRESS SYSTEM: The train just arrived at platform 5, is the 5:20 from Newcastle. The train just arrived at platform 5, is the 5:20 from Newcastle. [phone ringing] Yeah? VOICE ON PHONE: Hello? Who is it and what do you want? VOICE ON PHONE: I'm a friend of Mick's. [phone off-hook] DANNY: Cheryl? Cheryl. Come back to bed. [inaudible] Cheryl. Cheryl. What's the matter, hey? You still got plenty of time. You know who that was? Someone asking about Mick. Who was it? Well I didn't ask him for his name and address. What you got to worry about, hey? You got me. I'll look after you. Leave me alone. Just go make some coffee. We're out. We're what? We ran out. I was going to get some-- I must have coffee in the mornings! There's no food. We're out of toothpaste. The light's gone in the bathroom. Even the loo flush don't work. You can't even take care of the simplest things. It's not exactly what you promised me Danny-boy. Look I'm doing my best to turn this place into some sort of home for us. That costs money. You don't seem to appreciate that, Cheryl. And it takes time. Well time's running out. Getting out of here. I'm getting out today. What you want to get out for? I said I'd do the place up for you. You'll forget Mick was ever here. Just pick out the colors you want, hey? I'll find a way to pay for it. I always find a way. I got you the kitchen cupboards, didn't I? Got you the video. Oh I see they're on the list. What were you going to do? Frame it and hang it over the bed so I don't forget how much you've spent on me? Look things are a lot worse than we thought, Cheryl. A lot worse. What you and I bring in it doesn't even cover the interest on the bank loan. If I can't find a way to borrow another grand fast they're gonna cut out the phone, the gas, and the electric. That's how bad it is. Then we better do it tonight. We always said a Friday night. Last week there was over 10 grand. That'll do us. I'm not coming back here. Not after that phone call. That was trouble, for both of us. This American, how much is he thinking that you're worth? $3 billion. Lot of money. You know, Johnny, there are people who move about the world with no more than a pen in their pockets smelling out investment. We've got one in town today. You what the shakedown's going to be? How much money is going to move around this city while that signature's still wet. Well we're going to grab a nice little piece of that for ourselves. Might even put a bit of it your way, if you're lucky. In the meantime, you can get out on the streets and earn me some money. I'll drop you off at the Trocadero. If I shuffle things around a bit we'll probably be all right. I'll go see my brother. He must be making a nice few quid. I'll borrow some off of him, open up a new account, and overdraw on that a few hundred. Look, I can't take much more of this, Danny. I told you. It'll be dead easy. It'll be 3:00 in the morning, no one about, and he'll be plastered. Same as every Friday. Look if we play our cards right we won't have to go through with this. It's stupid. I'll only get caught. Look. I'll pick you up same time as usual, hey? 5:00 sharp. You can be such a fucking wimp. Don't. Don't ever call me that. MARION: I'm, uh, 22 years old and quite good looking. Natural blonde. Nice body. I used to go to aerobics classes, but now I switched to the Alexander Technique. I'm 5 foot 9. I like all kinds of music. I read quite a bit. Mysteries, thrillers, that kind of thing. Got my own little car. Golf. White. Sometimes go to the pictures if there's anything on. Weekends I like going to clubs and bars. I love cocktails. Champagne cocktails are my favorite. I'll be wearing a blue dress. I've got blue eyes so anything blue looks good on me. It's got a split up the side. Shows off my legs. I've got good legs. 25 quid, man. I mean I don't come any cheaper than that. It ain't worth it to me. I tell you. Ain't gonna get nobody cheaper than that. Some of these boys they won't even give you a lick for that. 25. OK. Settle it now, yeah? I don't do no fucking. No weird stuff. Strictly an hand-job, you know. For this kind of money. Where we gotta get to? [inaudible] Oh hey, money for a cab. I've got to get back in the West End for [inaudible]. Is it [inaudible] with you? No worries. You'll get a good 40 minutes. HELICOPTER TOUR VOICE 1: You must forget about what it used to be like here. There's a new Britain emerging. Fitter. Leaner. Hungry to compete. Ready to assert itself in the world's financial and commercial arenas. A new nation that needs a new kind of city. So we're building it. The whole of the East End is being cleared out and cleaned up. Streamlined with new roads, railways, airstrips. Wired up to the new technologies. HELICOPTER TOUR VOICE 2: What about the unions? HELICOPTER TOUR VOICE 1: They've been given a sound thrashing and now they're seeing sense. What we are attracting here is a new breed altogether. Tough. Motivated. Ambitious. Anyone who wants to stay in the race in the 21st century is moving in now. You better get going. No way. I just want to see what a man like that looks like. Introduce me. Not now. Later, I'll try and bring him along tonight. Definitely. If I can. Definitely. That flash bastard make me nervous. There was another fire last night. It's all over the papers. I've told you before, Tim, we have to move fast if we want to cash in on all this. But 3 people died. You knew it wouldn't be easy. That's why I brought him in. He's done a good job and he's persuaded a lot of people to put their money in with us. I'd like to see some of it. You'll meet them tonight. Don't worry. It's all going to be OK. Is everything ready here? They've got the contracts laid out inside just waiting for his signature. Pleased to meet you after all this time. A pleasure meeting you. Had a good trip? Very good, thank you. We're entering phase 2 now. Converting the rest of the warehouses. Catering to the new population was arriving here in droves. Now over there's going to be a new public school. Oh, I want to thank you again for last night. It was an excellent performance. Very good seats. I never tire of Shakespeare. It's my pleasure. You know gentlemen, this young lady can fix anything. She even found out what my favorite bourbon was. There was a bottle of it in my room last night when I got back. She certainly does her job well. Can I introduce you to-- What's on the menu for tonight? There's a banquet at the American Bar Association, or a boxing match, then perhaps a quick visit an Eastern nightclub. Sounds good. - James Lee. - Mr. Lee. How do you do? It's a pleasure. WELLINGTON: Here it is. CHUCK: Wow. It's incredible. How do you plan on getting all of that through your committees? We can get anything through here. It's El Dorado. The basic idea is to extend the canal system. Not in any functional way, but to turn this part of London into a waterway city. A Venice for the modern era. But we have Venice, mister? Wellington Horne-Ryder. Wellington Horne-Ryder. And I think we'll have Venice even in the modern era. I don't know that London needs to become another Venice or Paris or New York. Of course I didn't quite mean it in that, uh, literal, sense. Anyway. Venice is crumbling into the sea which doesn't make it the best advertisement, does it? No, I didn't mean it quite that way. It's remarkable. It's a fine model. Wonderful sense of proportion. Well. Thank you. And I see, you've, uh, you've managed to blow up those housing projects, which would be unsightly. Oh the Council Estates. Yes. If we could blow them up, but people do live in them. So what I've tried to do, through wholesale landscaping of the area, is to effectively screen them from view. So that the hotel, and the apartment complexes, which are to be stepped and terraced from the water, will have-- Will have a picturesque view of the river and the harbor which you've also included. Exactly. I'm much obliged mister, uh-- Wellington Horne-Ryder. Wellington Horne-Ryder. And much impressed. Well I've seen the contracts, and I've spoken to my lawyers. And they've seen the leases, and um, I've read a pile of reports. And Mr. Cavendish here has familiarized me with his projections, and-- Well. The champagne is ready. Although no one is signing anything yet, I think everyone would appreciate a glass. Yes? And uh, all I have to do now is, think about it. Of course. And it's being such a glorious summer's day. Yes, they said it's going to be in the '80s. I think I should like, if you'll excuse me, to take a walk through your city. Oh, we'll get you a car. Mr. Cavendish, I have seen London from planes, helicopters, and all manner of limousines. I think I just like to stretch my legs, and see it at my own pace, in my own time. Yes, of course. And I will give you my answer as soon as I've made up my mind. Thank you gentlemen. Ladies. Good day. So while he spends the day sightseeing, we've got to sweat it out here. Isn't there anything else you can do? Not before he gets back to the hotel. Ten's all I could manage. Thanks. I'll pay you back. Got a [inaudible] back. Still. There you go. Someone's got to support the arts. Why won't he take your story then? Not violent enough. He wants more blood and guts. You'll have to give me a few more pointers. Ah ha ha, not me mate. You've had all you're going to get out of me. Make it up. People will believe anything you tell about the East End. They'll love it. You got to make a few compromises. That's what I keep telling you. Sort out your bills get some things in your club on your back. Then write your great British novel. - [inaudible] - Not bad. Here you go. Get us a round of drinks. Couple of lagers and a pint of beer. How'd it go last night anyway? What was he? Brazilian? From Peru. Foreigners. I love them. They're not spending their fucking money on anybody else. Mind you, do you know what the exchange rate was yesterday? I'll tell you. I'm put my rates up. They're robbing me blind. I've gotta get enough to give and get out while it's still time. Cheers. You should have more fucking sense. Me? Talented geezer like you. College education. Scratching around for pennies. If you think it's going to get any better here you've gotta be living in dreams. It's going to get worse, worse, and fucking worse. Where are you off to, then? America, man. America. Where else is there to fucking go? 50 million people can't just hop on a plane. Fuck the 50 million. I'm talking about me. Total [inaudible] gay. I'll get there. I'll get there. Don't you worry. [inaudible] over there. The jail bait. Sound him out. I'm serious.

People in town are asking about Mick. Why not tonight? Your wife's not going to get any more bearable. And I've had it with Danny. He's driving me crazy with his fucking calculator. Look, if we make it through tonight, this time tomorrow we'll be sitting on the beach watching the waves. There'll be no going back. I don't want to go back. I just want to get away. That's it. That's the night safe. He always drops the takings at the end of the night. He'll be on his own. There's never anybody about. Really, Vince. It couldn't be easier. How old are you? 15. You're still a virgin? No. Pretend you are. Nothing turns him on like a virgin. It's a bit more cash in it. You get to know everyone's weaknesses in this game. You got to get in now.

If you're thirsty it's better to add some water here. I'm surprised you're staying in a dump like this. You can get a much better view from [inaudible] places in Park Lane. Yeah, but there's nothing to look at in Park Lane. Just grass. I like watching people. You can learn a thing or two. What can you learn from looking out there? Fucking desperation. I'm told you like it rough. Not too rough. But rough. What else did you hear? That you're an important man. Bit a money to spend. How'd you make that kind of money? Heh heh. By keeping sentiment out of business. Yeah. That's been my downfall. I'm too much of a nice guy. I've got to be harder. You're gonna draw [inaudible] Would you? Put some smiles on a few faces. I won't get much out of it. I won't get nothing out of it. Money down the drain. You'd be better off putting it in Hong Kong. It's all changing out there you know. Which way? A lot of people are moving their money out. It's gotta go their way. Biggest market in the world on their doorstep. All this talk can give someone a bad idea of a day. How much is this going to cost me? It's taken care of. Except for tips. Then you better start earning your money. What's wrong? You're hardly touching the crime end That was supposed to be the core of the piece. It's not a bad little piece on the bars, but nothing much seems to happening. I want gangland, mafia connections, drug running. I don't know that there's that kind of story at all. Small time. One to one stuff. What about these burnings? 3 warehouses in six weeks. Jesus with all this money sloshing around the East End something must be going on down there. You know what the trouble is. You spend too much time in this office. You ought to be out there. Poking your nose around. Saturate yourself in it. Bring me back a racy, edgy piece. An American detective novel. Dashiell Hammett! Why-- Well I thought you wanted a fairly realistic account.

What is chopped up and fed to the fishes for all we know. I mean what do you want me to do? Write it for you? Get down there you cunt. Hi, darling. She's been in there half an hour. What all she does in there? Well, takes her that long to cover up the cold sores. God, you're such a bitch. What you say about me when I'm not around? That you're a slag. Which you are. At least I got better taste than she has. I do. That's why she get's away with everything. Ah, I guess more money too. Didn't you know? She gets paid more than you. Gaynor. Have you seen what they've written about you on the wall in there? GAYNOR: What? Oh, it's all right, love. I wiped it off. Anyway, some of it wasn't even true. Come on girls. Get a move on.

And give Cheryl a nudge, will ya? Tell that server I'll laugh and call it [inaudible]. Oy, Cheryl. Gotta do some work. Half a lager. Make it a pint. What time does it open upstairs? 10 o'clock. That's where you had the fire, isn't it? Expect you'll be busy tonight. That'll be 1.40. A lot of people on the streets. Friday is always our busiest night. No, no. It's not the detail, it's the long term projections that worry me. They're going to run out of oil, everyone knows that. Soon it'll be 5 or 6 million people out of work and running riot. Now who knows what kind of a government that's going to throw up. Right, I could find my money stuck here. So, dump Sterling, buy Yen. I'll be in Tokyo Tuesday, and tell my wife I'll be home tonight. Ha ha, right. OK. Bye. All right. Let's go. I've got a plane to catch. Come on, up and at them. Ooh, dear. I was going to show you around later. Take you to a club.

Listen, I'm not going to be able to make dinner after all. Got some business to finish off at the airport. But I'm going to help you out a little bit. The keys to the city. The keys to my apartment. I'll bring the address out for you. It's a nice little place just off the Bays All Road. You can take it or leave it. Comes with a [inaudible] called Josie. You'll be doing me a favor if you say goodbye to her for me. And a sugar daddy called Derek. He's got a set of keys too. Nice old bloke. 65. No way. He would take you out for dinner, and all he needs is a service once a week. No rain, no worries. And the job of the agency. That'll keep you in clothes and pocket money. It's the best I can do. It's not a bad life. You'll see a bit of London society. It will be an introduction. I haven't got the taste for it. My friend will sort us out without all that crap. You'll get the taste for it, believe me. And take my advice. Forget all about this mate of yours. Pretend he never existed. I've got to go. Good luck, kid. [buzzer] [buzzer] Aw fuck. Come on, Vince. Push em up. Push! Come on. Push it, come on. Push it! One more. Push. All Right. Push! All right, I've got it. That was fun. All right. Managed to borrow 500 to put on Billy-boy tonight.

I'm not missing my sunbed now. Been waiting nearly half an hour. Don't worry about it. You're getting all hot and bothered. Relax. I'm trying. Get a bit of color yourself. Might improve your chances. [montage music plays] ROY: Here's trouble. Are we ready? Yup, fine. RICHARD: I've seen him before. CHERYL: Probably on the telly. RICHARD: Actor is he? ROY: Acting? Is that what you call it? We've all seen the videos. Boy With the Golden Ass. You seen that one? He thought he destroyed them all. But I got hold of a few copies. What's going on? I wish I knew. I thought he was barred. It's a good job Frank's not about. I got to get him out of here before he gets back. And how you gonna to do that? Frank wouldn't have let him in, What's happening? What's he doing down here? He's been asking about Johnny. So where is Johnny tonight? Says he's got an important job on. You haven't introduced me to your new friend here. This is Pete. Fresh in from Newcastle. Come down to the big city to be corrupted, have we? I've come out to see Mick. What time does he start? No one called Mick working here. I know he works here. I know everyone. There's no one called Mick here. See that kid over there? Which one? Blondy. What about him? He's a friend of Mick's. From up north. Half a lager. Empire Special. Wonderful around here isn't it? Bit of old East End atmosphere. Bit of charm. Lovely ladies who speak proper. Oh I do like it. Mmm, I should check your change. They always short change. And if you're out of work as often as I am, darling, you do have to count the copper. I've just seen a friend of mine. BARFLY: Sorry guv. I'm sorry, guv. Didn't mean to offend you. Is there anyone sitting here? No. It's bloody loony over there. Didn't I see you at lunchtime. With Johnny. Aye. Thought he might be here tonight. Introduce me to a few people. He knows them all. You on your own then? Came out to see a mate of mine. Tell us he doesn't work here, but I know he does. He sent us this. Tell us he's working in this place and earn tons of money. Do you know what he does here? Works on the door, he's a bouncer. Wouldn't have thought you'd earn that much just on the door. Told us you can make a lot of contacts working clubs. There's something funny going on here. I'm going ask around about my friend. See the manager. If he won't tell us I'll go and see the police. You have to be careful in a place like this. Why don't I ask one or two people. I'm a reporter. I'll see what I can find out for you. Do you mind if I hang on to this? PETE: I want it back. There's a guy over there asking questions about Mick. - Who is he? - I don't know. Well find out who the fuck he is. How's the fight going? Oh, they're well into the 5th. He's going all over the place. The ketchup's really flowing. Heh, that's what I like to hear. Good old Billy-boy. How much you put on Billy-boy? A lot, mate. Yeah, well you can kiss that goodbye. Any word from Johnny? Not yet. I've heard you've got a little surprise for us. That the American is coming here. Yes, well not a surprise now, is it. Gentlemen. How did you pull that off? Friends in high places, Margaret. Mmmm. I'll see you in a minute. Excuse me, sir. He's clean. Can't come in like that, mate. You got a reservation? Just wanted a look. 18. Mick on tonight? Mick? He hasn't worked here for weeks. Why's that? Knew him pretty well, did you? He's a good friend of mine. It's that business with the kids. What was that then? Didn't you read about it? Two kids died. Designer drugs. Found dead in the toilet up there. He wasn't involved in that, was he? Well Frank, you know, the manager, he went spare. He quizzed all the staff and someone must have put the finger on Mick. Cause he'd get a bunk. Nobody's seen him since. Not even Cheryl. One or two people here reckon that she's the that told Frank. I think so. Why would she do that? That's what I say. Mind you couldn't be much fun living with a junkie. I don't know the last time you saw him, but he was getting pretty bad. I heard he was on the needle. Johnny call in yet? Not yet. How about your address in New York. Just in case I pop over there. 84th street. This for real? No, I couldn't give you that, but got my signature. This isn't worth much where I'm going. It's been a pleasure doing business with you. Likewise. Have a nice trip. Say hello to the wife for me. Take care. I'll look after myself. Don't you worry. What's the cheapest ticket to New York? Regular or standby? Cheapest. Ladies. Thank you. There you go, love. Shit. Probably came and left again. Got checked with somebody else. He might be upstairs. Hello, Doreen. Gimme the girl in the blue. Stop playing with your hair. For you, love. Really? Hello? [inaudible] Who is this? [inaudible] - Is that you, Harry? Who is it? Right behind you darling getting a lovely view of your little bum. See me now? I'm the good looking fellow staring right at you. I'll be right over. God, he's awful. It's finished. Get me a drink. I'm not serving you. Look at the state of you. Get me a vodka and tonic. Keep your voice down. Give him a drink for Christ-sake. I'm all right, Vince. I'm all right mate. I've got money. I've got money. That's the last one you're getting and then you go. Everything's going to be all right. You're gonna be fucking proud of me. Yes, what do you want? Roy, wait. Who's that? Some cunt from the north. He's been asking after Mick all night. I'm all right, mate. I'm sorry. [inaudible] it [inaudible] be a [inaudible] chaps I'm all right. On your way then. Cheers. You still [inaudible] Do me a favor. I'm a married man. [drunken banter] Fuck off! (ANGRILY) You knew the result of the fight before it was started. What did you find out? From what I've heard so far, I think you'd be better off forgetting about Mick. It's what everyone keeps telling us. Well, it's not good enough, and I'm not leaving it at that, right? I'm going to find out what's going on, and I'm going to do something about it. And I though you we're going to help us, eh? Eh? Hold on. In my office, now. Um, there's a bit of your East End charm. Excuse me. Everyone seems to be moving down here. Do you think I should sell my house in Holland Park? I bought a studio just down the road a year ago. It's already doubled in value. Nobody fixes my fights except me. He lost. He had things on his mind. Yeah. Like a fat back-hander from your mom. I want it back. Tonight. All 40 grand of it. And then I want you out of here. And you can pick up your scumbags crawling all over the place peddling drugs. This is my place, and I run it clean. I warned you after those kids died. You can't put that one on me. Any 13-year-old with a chemistry set can get a buzz these days. They're making this stuff in school. I break anyone I find selling that filth in here. And your poncey friends in there. I don't know what they're pushing. I want them out too. I've had enough. If I don't have that 40 grand by the end of the night, there's going to be trouble Oh really. What are you going to do? Take me down a dark alley and have my kneecaps busted? Or get out the thumbscrews? Well how would you like it? Bit of high tech? You just don't understand, do you? You don't even know those people are. They own this place. Like fuck they do. Checked your lease lately? 14 months. That's all you've got left, and it won't be up for renewal. You've been terminated. I'll be running things around here. You see, Frank. This part of London is changing. It's coming back to life. There's a new class of money moving in. This place will be pulled apart. Brick by brick. And put back together again with a bit of taste. And a bit of style. For people who appreciate it. I thought I'd have you stuffed. Put in a glass case as a little reminder of the past. You put a coin in the slot, and you hear it all pour out your mouth. All the old East End chat. The filthy language and the threats of the old violence. This is the new class, is it? Designer suits. 200 quid nickers. Nautilus body and Barbados suntan? Exotic women running around your warehouse apartment. I dare say if I don't [inaudible] like [inaudible] see You haven't got class. All you've got is the trappings. Everything you've got, mate, is bought. And you sold your ass to get it. I mean you really put it [inaudible] Even I've had it. Yeah well now we're even. Because now you're fucked. Gentlemen. I'm sorry to have kept you waiting. What time is he coming, the American? Soon. You don't rush a man like that. How was supper? Awful. I'll show you around the rest of the place. [inaudible] This will be the only club in the world with a river running through it. This will have to go. Oh, this side will be ripped down. You'll probably find some bodies behind the walls. [inaudible] We'll down these, sport. And then we'll go upstairs and break a few tubes of Foster's lager. Will you fuck off and leave me alone. I've had enough! [hysterical shouting] [dance music plays] KEN: That bastard's moved in on most of Frank's business. RICHARD: Seems to be doing all right on it. KEN: Started that in Piccadilly. Frank's looked after him since he was 16. Practically brought the little fucker up. Got him to look over some of his businesses and he ends up running them for himself. I'll bet you he was the one blowing those bad drugs. Yeah, when Mick had [inaudible] was a good night for [inaudible] Ken, we need you, mate. [shouting] Do you realize I spent 50,000 having those drawn up. I did nearly 120 into this thing now you're telling me it's off. I thought you had this all sewn up. What about the money I gave you? Now listen, you will all get your money back. What are you going to do? Rob a bank? Or mug somebody, pimp? You're out of order. He spent all of our money. What did he put in? I bought the fucking lease, that's how much I've put in. What with? Hard cash! What did you do, you stupid bitch. I did everything that we agreed I should do. Well it wasn't enough. Stop it! Well, seems that someone was going to put a bit of business their way in Scarpard. Must've burned their fingers badly because they fighting over the bills. They're talking hundreds of thousands. Tell Darren to get on the phone to Big Red. I might just need him here tonight. Looks like we might have a bit of fun after all. Young Paul will be back on the rack at Piccadilly when I'm through with him. Right. That little matter we were discussing earlier. I've arranged a little something for you and your friends on which you and I can settle, a point of honor, shall we say. We love animals. Up here. Tonight. Not interested. Listen mate. You might have had it all your own way with Billy-boy, but this time we're going to do it my way. Still my club yet, you know. It will give us all a chance to get our money back. We kick off with 40 grand. That should warm everyone's cockles. 40. Honest fight. No nonsense. What does he mean animals? Dogs? I don't care what it is. I need something. - I want my money back. That's all I care about. You are gonna have to get me my money back. What do we get out of this? Blood. Satisfaction. Money. - Come on let's do it. - Money. Give us our money back. Yes! All right. Try your luck. 40 grand. 50! For God's sake. You don't know what you're dealing with. This is what you want? Right. Right. Get me Stevie Kwon. I don't care if you have to comb the whole fucking city. You get me Stevie Kwon. What are you going to do about Frank? I'm going to pulverize him. He's finished. I'm going to grind him into the dust. Where's Johnny? Come on where's Johnny? I told you, I don't know. Sit her down and shut her up. Come on what do I pay you for? Right, you go to Johnny's flat. You wait for him. You give him a good hiding and you bring him to me. Come on then. What? That's the one who was asking about you. The reporter. Oh right. So you think you're gonna write a story about me, do you? If I see another fucking word about me in your paper pal, I'm going to have your bollocks off. Don't let him out of your sight. What did he tell you? What did you find out? Just leave me alone. - What happened to my mate? - Look I told you. Forget about him. Do you know what he was? He was a fucking junkie. You've had me running around all night asking out for a stupid, gullible, penniless, kid, who you thought had all the answers. Well where is he? What have they done to him? He's dead. Satisfied? He's probably at the bottom of the fucking river. Where you'll be too because you're just as stupid, and just as gullible. But he was my best mate. He was a nothing. He was a nobody. Just get out of here. Just go. I'm sorry, man. Shut up! What you gonna do now? New York. Return? One way. It's better over there, yeah? Excuse me. If I give you the money would you buy me a drink? I'm lonesome. I'll have to make a move. I've got work to do. Oh, fuck it. Why not. Mind if I buy us both one out of this? Go ahead. I'd like the champagne cocktail. I'll have a whiskey. Souvenir? Thank you. You're a writer, aren't you. That's right. Are you coming with us or what? I don't know what to do. I told you. We can stay at my place. Lend me 20p and we can get the night bus. Fuck him. Let's go. They're sweet, aren't they? I was talking to them earlier. Are they involved in your story? I'll tell you later. Why don't we have a dance. We can't talk here. This really is exciting, isn't it? Being a reporter. I always wanted to be a writer, you know? I won a short story competition once. Ended up working in a bloody bank. Have you got a car? Yes. I'm in trouble. Can you help me get out of here? When the lights come on, let's leave with everyone else. What's going on? I'll tell you the whole story once we're out of here. I have to get back to the office, and write. We'll both type the story, then we can go back to my place. - OK. OK? OK. I'm afraid you'll have to drive. I'm far too drunk. Me? I've never driven a car in my life. Don't worry. It's easy. I'll tell you what to do. Go on. Calm down. I'm all right, mate. Do you want me to get you a cab? No, I'm all right. I'm all right. Do you want to wait for Cheryl. Cheryl? Cheryl, what do you want me to do with him? Let him cool off in the river. Thanks. Right then. Taking up training? They give your brother a few pointers? Cheryl? Cheryl? Fuck off you pervert. Cheryl? You're gonna tell me how to drive this bloody thing or not? Cheryl? He'll probably save us the [inaudible] FRANK: I want you upstairs for another hour. We've got a little bit of entertainment up there. Played on. Come on, Frank. 40 grand we want to offer you, mate. That's just for start. Up it to 50. [cheers] 50. And I'll have you betting over the bar before I'm finished. Ladies and gentlemen. You'd like to make your bets now. Now, George here, George will run the book. OK, nothing less than 100, please. Now betting will continue right through the fight until the best man wins. Now you've come for a gape in the old East End so we've arranged a little old fashioned entertainment. No rules. No limits. No refs. No stopping for injuries. Right? Points for blood. Points for pain. Extra points if we get an ear bitten off or an eye knocked out. A fight. Nice and dirty. More or less to a finish. All right? Now, we've got Big Red here. Come on, Red. [cheers and jeers] Just fresh from knocking out Jimmy William's teeth last night. And we've got this Chinese kid over here who fancies himself as the next Bruce Lee. All right now. Let's have some money in the bucket here for these bastards to fight for. [crowd getting excited] Now we're moving. I'm gonna raise the stakes against my old mate over there. I'm going to put my Jag in the kitty, against his little motor. Give it to the missus, do her shopping in. Come on. Come on. Come on, Stevie. That's the spirit. I love that nice suit of yours too, while I'm at it. Clean me ass with it. Save me buying paper. I put my best suit against that. Fucking, get up. Get up. Right. Right, you fucker. Let's do this properly. I want your ass. Match that cunt. I want your door keys on the floor. Know what? Get them in there. Let's get these bastards fighting. That's enough. It's getting out of hand. Stop playing with him. Hurt him! I like your lady friend on the floor, while I'm about it. Wouldn't mind a piece of that myself. What's she worth? - I've had enough. I'm going. You sit down. You go when I tell you. Right. I want the night's takings to cover that. He's sick. [crowd screams encouragement] Let's go. Get me out of here. I've got a ton riding on this one. What are you doing? We've blown it. There's always next Friday. Just get me a cab. You're going back. Where else is there to go? To Danny. Why not. Let me take you. Go on, piss off. Come on. Piss off. On your bike. On your bike. Go on then. Move it. Move it. There's a fight over here. All right mate. OK, You want some? Yes! Come on then! Yes! You want some! You want some! [screams] [screaming] VOICE GREETING (FROM INTERCOM): Welcome to Metropolis. Please take a seat.

I just want to see what a man like that looks like. VOICEOVER: It's a city that's changing, and if you know what you want, it's there for the taking. You know what the shakedown's going to be? How much money's gonna move around this city while that signature's still wet. Well we're gonna grab a nice little piece of that for ourselves. VOICEOVER: It's the taste of fear. I'm not going back to the [inaudible] friend to [inaudible] I'm not going back. VOICEOVER: It's the trouble that won't go away. Who the devil are you? I'm Johnny, didn't I give you a call?
