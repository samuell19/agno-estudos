All in one word: Atlantis. An ancient dream of a lost continent which techniques and culture are said to have reached mythical dimensions. Undiscovered up to date, but nevertheless, it is there. It exists. It is even shown on old maps. But, it would be useless to ask travelling offices for any information about it. But it exists in thousands of years in the history of the world and we know that these tenacious human dreams are always realized sooner or later. Troy was found. The Egyptian and Phoenician homes of culture were discovered. Atlantis will also be found. When I made the statement that Atlantis was not submerged in the ocean, but lost in the arid tracts of the southern Sahara, it would appear to be an actual fact. I mentioned to you the number of caravans, aeroplanes and persons who disappeared in the Sahara without any trace forever. I also told you that even today, there are oasis and villages in the desert, which loyal (???) have visited, or at least never left again alive. What would happen if the site of the lost Atlantis were known to the natives? It would today serve them as a secret stronghold. If it is not lying at the bottom of the sea, but just under the sands of the Sahara, covered, devoured by sand. Then the natives would build their houses upon it. What's the matter? -That man is right. -What? Perfectly right. Atlantis is covered by the sands of the Sahara. Well, how do you know? Because I've been there. I have seen Atlantis. Seen it? You're rather exaggerating ...aren't you? Two years ago... I saw...Atlantis. Two years ago? Oh, the case with Morhange. Oh, I'm sorry I mentioned the name. I've seen your report to the war office. There was no mention of Atlantis in it. You'd only reported your movements. That you were attacked by Tuaregs, and that Captain Morhange was killed. That's not true. Morhange was not killed by the Tuaregs. I killed him. Yes. I murdered Morhange! My best friend. Over two years ago... Captain Morhange and myself were sent by the war office to explore the possibilities of restoring the old Sahara road. Which runs from Tunis to the Niger. At least, that was the official reason for our expedition. The real and secret reason was to acquaint ourselves with the political feelings of the Tuareg tribes. At the start we joined up with a salt caravan, on its way to Timbuktu. I wonder if he was gold thief (?). Is it not pissible to bury it? It would be useless, the wind would blow the sand away. That is the Sahara! To tell you the truth, we should not be leaving you in the middle of the Sahara. Don't worry, my newspaper has taken good care of me. Goodbye, and be careful. We'll be all right. Don't you worry. Goodbye! Goodbye! I can't see any of these mountains marked on the map. How high do you think they are? It's difficult to say. About 6000 feet. It's extraordinary, I was just thinking of that old tale -of Atlantis being somewhere here in the Sahara. -Yes, I know. As a boy I was very interested in the story of Atlantis. I have spent many a nights studying the map, endeavoring to locate its position. According to my own fancy. It's strange to think that 15 years later, we might actually have found it. But everything looks so different. There is something. He's right. I'll go and see. Tuareg. -He's dying of thirst. -Nearly. There's not much pulse. -We'll have to take him with us. -Agreed. A man all by himself in the desert. He's a Tuareg. -Do you know of any village around here? -No village here. We shall have to be careful. There is always trouble in these parts, among the natives. He says he's lost the way. There must be a way through the pass. We've already seen it. Dead! Who else? Where is the Tuareg? He is Chamba. The Chambas are enemy of Tuareg. Do you know the pass? I know. You will guide us, Sigha ben Sheik. We will trust to you and... Morhange! It's the camels! I'll be back in a minute. Morhange! Morhange! Morhange! Morhange! Morhange! Where am I? Where's Morhange? What is it you want? Ransom, eh? Well, what's the ransom? Ransom... No. You French officers... come back with soldiers and machine guns. You...start...here. Morhange! Morhange. Morhange. Morhange! Morhange! Morhange! Where is Morhange? Ah, that's better! Recovered! Excellent! Do you know, my dear sir, I was getting very worried about you? But now, a changed man! Fresh...elegant! It's fine to see you on your legs again. Yes, a great relief! Oh, pray allow me to introduce myself... Count Velovsky, headman of (???). You were going to say there are no headman nowadays. What? But, I am a headman. Yes. I have held the title by right of succession from my mother. No doubt you are surprised to find a European. A Parisian in this godforsaken hole. A real Parisian too. But you will find many things here that will astonish you. Yes! Do you know I organized all this myself and I... Do you know this is all my work? I am not exaggerating. All this at one time was nothing but dark catacomb. Yes, I organized all this after fate had brought me to this place about... 19 years ago. But, now at times, it almost makes life agreeable. And sometimes... one finds very pleasant company. In that event, the inducement to crack a few bottles... becomes quite considerable. Yes, Sir. You may trust my age and experience. A cocktail at various depressing moments of the day accelerates the cycle of life in a marvelous manner. By the way... I am somewhat surprised that Mr Torstenson is not here yet. At cocktail time... -He is the only European beside yourself and... -Morhange! Yes, where is he? I say old chap! What's troubling you? Do stay here. He doesn't see us. Has Antinea seen him? Antinea? Oh, no! The idea! She won't want to see him. A delightful fellow. I am sorry to say we shall not have the pleasure of his company...much longer. Yes... He is going to die. For the last three weeks he has been smoking kief, An unfailing mixture, Sir, believe me. He does it out of love. Or, maybe despair. My name is Ivar Torstenson. Antinea? Antinea... But why all this mystery? Where are we exactly? Well, I have been here more than 20 years and even now I'm not quite sure where we are. But who is this Antinea? Antinea? But have you not heard of Atlantis? My dear fellow, the mysteries of Atlantis... A goddess! A beautiful woman! A Maginificent woman! That's Antinea, Sir. -A goddess? -Yes! But, are not all women in some ways divine? Well, let's drink to divine women. Believe me dear friend, there is no greater ecstasy, nothing more sacred than to die for a woman like that. Is that not so, Mr Torstenson? Antinea... I shall be called to her today. I know it. I know it. My congratulations! You are fortune's favorite! Antinea has sent for you. You will see Antinea. You will see Antinea! Gentlemen! Gentlemen! What is the meaning of all this? Like children, little children. I suppose you think I am a coward. All right. I don't care. You'll finish up... just like me. You'll see. No! You go on. Antinea... is waiting for you. Play. You may win your freedom. Check. Check. Check. Check. Check. Check. Check. Check. Check. Check. Check mate. Would you like to see our friend, Mr Torstenson... -for the last time? -For the last time? See, he looks much younger. He's happy now. His little bits and pieces. His amulet. Take this. As a little...souvenir. May I request your presence at the funeral? It will take place tomorrow. I promise nothing. I give no word of honor. I demand that Lt. Saint-Avit... and I, Captain Morhange, are released immediately. That is all I have to say. Halt! -Where is he going? -Perhaps to Antinea. To Antinea? I implore you! Listen to me! You'll never find you way back. Morhange! Antinea! Antinea! You will now answer my question, at once! -With the greatest of pleasure. -That funeral yesterday... Whose was it? Funeral? Yesterday? Why, I...I know nothing about it. Oh, you mean the little family gathering we had. Oh, but my dear Captain, this is perfectly dreadful. Everything seems to be upside down. The fact is, Antinea is in love. In love for the first time in her life. Oh, it breaks my heart to see the poor child suffer like this. Captain? -The poor child is in love. -Stop it! All I want to know is, where is my friend? Oh, your friend, your friend! Why don't you ask Antinea? -Is he coming? -No. Captain Morhange... -Have you told him it's my order? -Yes, Tanit, but... Bring him here! By force! No! Stay here. Hello, old chap! Thank God you are back again. Very tiring journey, eh? Here. Take this. I'm switching and due a spot of...water. I want to see Antinea. You want to see Antinea? This is Antinea. Who is Antinea? Well... Now I'll tell you. Antinea... is... Paris! Mine? And Clementine, when you are Queen... I trust you will find a place for an old friend at your court. But, he was not the father... Her name was Clementine. A beautiful dancer. Twenty years ago. Clementine. Cle-men-tin-ia! Clem... en...tin...ia! Not a word, Sir! Not a word! State secret. State secret! He who loses... at chess... loses his ease. He who wins in love... wins death. Death? Who? Who has to die? I don't know. The bones tell only death. No! No! Not you. Not you. He. Kief! Poison. You'll die. Come... I save you. No. I shall stay here. I have a feeling... that I shall be called to her... today. Don't you think so? You don't. Why not? Why not? She see...nobody. Nobody! Mistress loves. -Take me to her! -No! No! She'll kill me. The captured! Where is my friend? Is he still alive? I implore you... Answer my question! Where is my friend? You shall answer me! Do you hear? If you have killed him... why do you let me live? Because I've chosen you. Here...the women chose their men, I know. Our ideas are different. Perhaps, I might have given you your freedom? You... and your friend. Then he is still alive! -Let me see him! -Oh, always your friend! I shall have him killed! Even then, I wouldn't give in to you. I love you. I love you. Go! Get out! Kill him. Kill him. Saint-Avit... Curse you! You... Come... I save you. Come! Come! Morhange. Morhange... Peace be with you. Lt. Saint-Avit. And peace be with you, Sigha ben Sheik. Be careful with the water. Most of the wells are dry. The Prophet allows his followers once in their life... to put pity before duty. ...Hospital. And there I remained for several weeks. Well, old man. We'd better go and lie down for a couple of hours. This Tuareg has been caught by the patrol, Sir. He refused to speak. Peace be with you... Captain Saint-Avit. Peace be with you... Sigha ben Sheik. -Let him go. I know him. -Yes, Sir. ...the Captain simply cannot distinguish any longer between the hallucinations due to his delirious fever dreams of the time and his actual experiences. I consider it therefore my duty as an Officer and a friend of Capt. St. Avit to report on his mental condition which... Attention! Unit 4! Unit 12! Unit 27! Unit 17! Unit 15! Unit 48! Sir! The Captain has not come back yet. -Did the Captain ride off? -Yes, Sir. Two hours ago. Alone. We mustn't lose a moment, and go after him. Sandstorm. Saint-Avit! Saint-Avit!
