Good afternoon, madam. I am so sorry I am late, madam. Is the audition over? - Is it? - No. It just starts. As you are Genevieve, we will wait for you! Now that are here, should we make you coffee or tea, now? Madam, madam, ma'am, please, madam. Madam, please, I'm begging. I'm begging. Please, this audition means the world to me. Please. That's why you're shaking like a rabbit. See if you want to enter that place now, you need to be three. Three, you enter. So you need to look for two people who will join you before I will let you enter. And I give five minutes. Or just sit down. Pray maybe two people come and make you three. They tell you to come, they give you time. You're wasting time doing nonsense. Destiny, my mother always said, needs a bit of coincidence. Well, I agree. But maybe it's the other way round. Coincidence needs a bit of destiny. - Good afternoon. - Whoo! Um, we're here for the audition. Here for the audition by this time? We are three now! And action! You mean she's pregnant?! Yes. Six weeks gone. And what are you going to do? Honestly, I don't know what to do. Girl, you don't know? Let me get this straight. Your husband is cheating, and you tell me that you don't know what to do? Tell me, what do I do? Well, forgive him, of course! Yes, forgive him. Listen, the sad truth is that husbands are scarce these days. And as painful as it is, you have to suck it up, suck it in, and stay put. And for the next six months, you starve him of any, I said any, inkling of sex. And you set an alarm clock to wake you up each night to do just one thing. Scrub the toilet. Scrub the toilet? Really? With his toothbrush! Cut. So in your stupid minds now you want to become stars, right? ♪ Ah, she see me today ♪ ♪ Never, ever will I hunger again ♪ ♪ Today be the day ♪ ♪ The sun will shine But enough of today ♪ ♪ Come on, come on ♪ ♪ Every day go the wonder day ♪ ♪ Dear father, give us strength For another day ♪ Indeed, Mother was right. Destiny does need a bit of coincidence. But maybe she forgot to mention something else. Destiny also needs time. And with time, things have a way of falling into place. This must be a strange land. A land for restless souls. Mystery has greeted our thoughts, and adventure has become a curse. But how do we return? You can't return... once you've crossed the river of blood. What becomes of us? What becomes of us? Your questions are worthless. And the answers do not reside in the land of the dead. Cut. High five! High five, high five, high five! I mean, admit it or not, you three seem to be the rave of the moment! Well, it depends on what you mean by the expression "Rave of the moment." I mean, you are in the spotlight, and everywhere we turn there is a resounding buzz about your sudden rise to fame. Well, four years isn't exactly sudden, darling. There were nights where we cried ourselves to sleep. Days where we couldn't make it to the next audition. And moments where we thought it was just... a waste of time. We never stopped believing. We never gave up. We never stopped trusting. And more importantly... We just never stopped dreaming. And if there's one thing I want you to know, it's this one fact. Dreams do come true! Hello. - Hello. - My name is Jojo. I'm actually a huge fan of yours. I've seen all of your movies. In fact, I'm just an inch away from being an obsessed fan. OK... You can ask Timi. She'll tell you about it. I am sorry. He's my little cousin. Will you die if you don't add "little?" Just say "cousin." Well, that's true. Too much detail! Well, hello, Jojo. Always wanted to do that. OK, nice to meet you, Jojo. From being an inch away from an obsessed fan, maybe we can do lunch? Whatever you're comfortable with. - Definitely. I'd love to do that. - Timi will give you all the details. All right. Thank you. I'll be looking forward to it. All right. Nice to meet you. - You look amazing. - Thank you! Wow. - What are you doing here? - I came to see some friends in the area. And you promised that you'd introduce us, so I thought... You have fulfilled your wish. Can you run along, little cousin? Don't forget the details. I'll be expecting it. I'm so sorry about that. That's OK. He's a very... confident young man. He just turned 20 or 21 and he feels the world is a PlayStation. Another delay? But I thought you said you'd be back today. I know. I know, darling. I know. But plans changed, OK? It's a little glitch in the negotiations. I'll have the deal wrapped up. Babe, that's all I ever keep hearing. That's what you told me yesterday. And the day before. Every single day. A little glitch. And a little glitch. And a little glitch. It's been two weeks. I should have gone with you on this trip. I know. I know. Don't worry. I'll be back as soon as I can, OK? Look, it could be tomorrow. Besides, I went shopping yesterday and I got you some stuff. What? I'm not telling you. Why would I tell you? It's a surprise. But it's something you're gonna love. Just hurry and come back. I miss you. I miss you more, OK? - I love you. - No, I love you more! Bye, babe. I'll see you soon, OK? Bye. Good morning, ma'am. You're late. Yes, I know I'm late. The traffic was crazy. And I tried as much as possible... to get here as soon as... - Jesus! - I could. Yes, Francine. Hello? Yes, Francine. No, I told you I have to be in Paris at 4.00 this afternoon. This afternoon, yes, exactly. Yes, I'm already late. So hurry up, please. Yes, right now. Come on. My name is Wendy Hayford. Around here, they call me the fixer. I fix things and I fix people. Well, merci, Madam Hayford. But I'm a little lost here. You see, I received this emergency call this morning that literally yanked me out of bed and I am seated here thinking, what has this got to do with us? It has a lot to do with all of you. Let's start with you, Naadei. Three months ago you managed to ditch your weed and cocaine addiction, and substituted it with four-hourly doses of Advil and energy drink. That strap of weed that you forgot in your handbag landed you in trouble at the Lagos airport. If that had caught the blogs, it would have been a smear on your reputation, not to mention all the international endorsement deals. Hmm... Jaya. I must say that you've done quite well in trying to cover up this relationship. What relationship are you talking about? Quite classic. This relationship! Did you know that Greg was wanted for rape in the UK? And did you also know that he has a pending case with the EFCC? No, no, no, no, no, no! No! No! But I know he loves me. Yeah, I'm sure he's said that to you many times before. But there are many men in Accra that would love to date a superstar girlfriend like you, with a fancy car and a really nice house. And even though we encourage these fairy-tale relationships, which really are good for your image in the long run, you do have to thread very carefully. - Now on to you. - OK! We get the point already. Listen, ladies, I am not the enemy here. It's a hard, slippery industry you're in. - And like they say... - Shit happens. For as long as you're under the House of Fame management, it is my responsibility to make sure that you don't screw up your public image. And just in case you do mess up... I might just be able to fix it. You have to answer me! - Answer me. - I know I should have told you. It was a lot to talk about. Is that why you relocated to Ghana? This whole career move is the reason why you are on the run? No, baby. Look, baby. I did not rape anyone, OK? I was falsely accused, baby. I didn't know how to prove it. But I didn't do it. I did not do it! - Done? - Almost. But there seems to be a little problem with the time for the event. The mail says 8.00pm and the invite says 5.00pm. Good. I didn't even want to attend anyways. How about the presentation at the orphanage? Tick it. That's good for PR. Um... Would you need me to do anything else before I leave? Um... Uh, call Nana on your way out. Trash, laundry, cleaning on Saturday, and then, uh... spa on Sunday. Oh, yes, and please call that journalist that has been calling the life out of me, that I'll grant him a five-minute interview, but he can't ask me any questions on marriage or my personal life. It has to be work. Just work. OK. Got it, boss. I'm out. What is it, Dona? I forgot to remind you of your hospital check-up. Skip it. My knee is fine. What? OK. Bye. Dona? What did you forget this time? Tell me I didn't get you this time! I did, didn't I? I did. I did. - Why did you do that? - Hey, baby. Hi, baby. I missed you. Ooh! Flowers. What? - Let me tell you. - Show me. - Baby. - Hey, baby. I found this old wrap on the shelf somewhere. Well, I guess you won't be needing your fix, then. Oh, my God! What? Is Nati and Kofi engaged? Oh, yes. I saw it too. Hmm. Interesting. Oh, my goodness! An old actress with four kids from four different men is getting married. And look at me. I don't even have a boyfriend. We should put this in a screenplay. The irony of life. Well, talking about finding a boyfriend, have you seen how Kwesi looks at you lately? - Kwesi? - Yes. - Kwesi the director? - Mm-hmm. How does he look at me? OK. It is not the regular, "If I get, I'ma go chop am" kinda look. It is, "What a beauty to behold" kinda look. Well, I haven't noticed Kwesi staring at me. Plus, I know Kwesi loves his women with the big boobs and all of that. Just like yourself. You're his spec. You're what he likes. No. This is not about me. See, Kwesi has a thing for you, Naadei. He likes you! In as much as I... What? Whoa! Hello. Hi, Kwesi. Hey. Hey. - Bad time? - No, no, not at all. No, not at all. I just realized I haven't called since the last time off set. So I thought it'd be good to call and connect. Yeah, I know. I am so sorry. I... I totally forgot. I should have sent a text at least. Ah, that's fine. How's your day going? You should see me. I'm just sitting outside, you know, staring at the trees, looking into the skies. That sounds like boredom to me, you know? Yeah. Boring is me. It help me stay out of trouble. Ah, that's true. But, um, I was thinking, we could grab a drink sometime. I know this cool place called Mix-it. Trust me, their drinks are off the hook. You'll love it. Yeah, yeah. Of course. Why not? We can go and check out the place. I'd love to try all their drinks. So I wrap up set in a few days. I'll hit you up on WhatsApp. Great, great, great. Great. OK. Have a good day and take care of yourself. OK, I will. I will. Bye. So? So, there's something about this call that is... so out of place. What do you mean, out of place? - He wants to have drinks with me. - Uh-huh? What's wrong with that? That unsettles me a little bit. Hello, Kwesi. What the hell happened? I told you to keep it simple and simply ask her out for a drink. What more did you say? Well, she seems a little... You know what? Never mind. I'm going to work it from my end, OK? All right. We'll talk later. Take care. Bye. I told you there was something unsettling about that phone call, didn't I? Timi, let this be the last time you try to hook me up. Shit! OK, can you guys stop this? Stop what? This... this thing. I am sorry about the comment I made about Greg. But you can get laid as many times as you like. Naadei! Well, let her be, Chioma. At least I am getting some. And you know, depression is a long-term side-effect of vibrators. - Jaya! - Bam! This is not good, Jaya. You finished her! I swear! You massacred it! - What did you just say? - You heard it! E pain you! E pain am! Wait, for a minute, I was like... I was like, this is a knockout. It's like she destroyed you! Destroyed you! I swear. I'm sleeping with Randy. Shh! Shh! - What? - Randy? Don't scream. Don't scream. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! Randy? UK Randy? From the awards? Will you not scream? Just... The same Randy who got us our tickets, our card, who took us out? Randy, the married man? Yes, that Randy. What? I love him! We love each other. I really, really love him. I love him so much that sometimes it hurts just knowing that he can't be mine. You know what they say. Sometimes, love is just not enough. And yet, sometimes it is. - Hey. - Hey. Sorry to barge in on you like this. - Can I come in? - Yeah, it's fine. I thought it was Timi. Come in. Sorry, again. Are you here to see Timi? No. I'm actually here to see you. OK. I know Timi's out running errands. So I thought I'll swing by. Thinking about it... I hope this isn't out of place... or too crazy, but... I just couldn't wait to see you. I couldn't stop thinking about you. That is... understandable, right? I guess I finally found myself a real fan. Do you want to sit? Sure. I'll have a seat. I'll have a seat. You know... I did it. You did what? Something I've always wanted to do. What are you doing? Wait, wait, wait, wait. What are you doing?! Oh, my God. What have you done? What is this? What...? Why would you do a thing like this? I always wanted to feel like you were a part of me. This is... Crazy? No, it's shocking. You've got my name... On my body. Forever. OK. Um... What would you like to drink? Water. OK, I'll... get you some water. That's fine, I don't need a glass. OK. Um... I'm gonna go upstairs and, you know, change into something more decent. Give me a minute. Jojo? Jojo? Look, I'll be back in one day, OK? Back to the same routine, huh? You stopping by on your way home from work... and stealing a few minutes in between lunch breaks? Babe, it's not always going to be like this, OK? I promise. Don't forget to clear your call log and delete our chats. ♪ Little bird, whisper ♪ ♪ Right now ♪ ♪ Make me feel all right ♪ ♪ Cos I know it's bad ♪ ♪ I know it's bad ♪ ♪ I know it's bad ♪ ♪ But I want you back ♪ ♪ I know it's bad ♪ ♪ It's bad ♪ ♪ I know it's bad ♪ ♪ But I want you back ♪ ♪ I want you back ♪ Dad! Hey, Ray. Huh? My Lion King, how are you? Cool, Dad! What kept you so long? Work, OK? Look, I have to work to make money to buy you all those video games. Blackmail! - Where's your mother? - Bedroom, I guess. She's been kind of moody. Maybe you could do the trick. All right, go. I'll meet you at the back. Hey! Hello, love. Are you OK? Ray says you've been moody all day. Well, I have just had a lot on my mind. Oh. OK. You know, when we first met... all you had were dreams. Dreams I was crazy enough to believe in. We had no money. Not even for a house. Thanks to my grandmother, who gave us that little room. It was there, on one of those nights that we had absolutely nothing to eat... that you made me all those promises. Promises I've never forgotten. You-You said... How was your trip? Um... Very well. Hungry? Yeah. Good. I made your favorite. Groundnut soup. How are you? Are you sure you're OK? I'm good. Silence was a sound. And the mystery is... I could be saying nothing and yet saying everything. In silence, then, I find my voice. A world of words trapped in thoughts. And if thoughts become things, then perhaps I should think even more. So I think of a house by a beach. Curtains tossed in the wind. The sand of the sea and the glitters of the clouds. I think of her eyes. Her smile. Her hands in mine. Her lips. The first kiss. The first touch. And then... silence. But remember, I told you... in silence, I find my voice. And my reality becomes my fantasy. Hello? - Hello. - Hey, it's Naadei. Hey, Naadei. What's up? Have you played my CD yet? Yes, I have. And? It's very intense. Poetic. That sounds like a compliment. You know, you've... You've really got guts, you know? Well... I wrote it just for you. How old are you, again? Old enough to understand the cosmic force of an obsession. You understand what an obsession is, don't you? But it's not a crime, is it? OK, I'll tell you what... why don't you come over tomorrow, OK? So we can talk about this obsession of yours. And maybe you can put in all that energy into something very productive. I can tell that you're very good with words. OK. Um... Sounds interesting. I told you there is a world of words trapped in my thoughts and in my head. I'll bring a few pieces for you to read. OK, all righty. - See you tomorrow. - OK. Bye. Bye-bye. Yes! Yes! I'll get it. Yes? Who's this? Hello? Are you there? Hello? Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Is this Randy Otoo's residence? Yes. Can I please speak to Mr. Randy? And you are? I'm Maame Esi Amoateng. He called our office to make an enquiry about a property and I was just calling to give him the details. Oh, I see. Um, kindly hold on. It's for you. Hello. Randy here. Randy, Randy? Why aren't you replying to my messages? Um, my phone was on silent. Oh! I turned it off. Oh, so you went home and you deliberately switched off your phone, right? Right? So, now that you are home I cease to exist to you? I don't exist, huh? I want to see you right now. I don't care how you do it or what you do. I want to see you right now. I want to see you. Are you listening to me? I want to see you right now! I don't care how you do it and honestly I don't care! I want to see you now! You usually don't give out the house number. Yeah, but, you know... my friend's sister, she's looking for a job, so I just offered to help. I don't even remember doing that. Please, can I...? No, no. The banana. Thank you. Thank you. - Hey. - Hi. - Come in. - OK. - How are you? - Yeah, I'm fine. No, you don't have to worry, Timi's not around. - Oh. - Yeah. You can have a seat. Thank you. So... OK, I, um... I want us to talk about this obsession of yours. Jojo, you know obsession is a very strong word. In this phase of your life, you're gonna go through all sorts of emotions. And, uh... I know it can be very overwhelming. But... I want you to curb a few things. A few things like...? Like your tattoo. I think it's, uh... it's a little bit too much. It's too extreme. But I don't think it was. I think it is. You see, I think... you are just confined by your own fears. You're imprisoned... by your caged desires. What do you mean by that? Close your eyes. I want to read something to you. - Close your eyes. - Do I really have to close my eyes? Yes. The mind sees deeper when the eyes are closed. OK. She was scared even when she didn't know she was. It wasn't the fear of what had happened. It was the fear of what could happen. What would happen if he touched her. His finger teasing her sides. His lips teasing her ears. His body pressing against hers. A kiss. A moan. A gasp. A gentle whisper. Those same words that she had always wanted to hear. And now, the moment had come. Wow! That was something. That was really good. That was really deep. You should write scripts or try acting. Eh. I live different lives in my head every day. Some days I'm just a... naive young adult. Other days... I'm just a man obsessed with you. OK. Uh... I'm gonna go upstairs to check if I can find a hard copy of a script so I can show you what a script looks like. - OK? I'll be back. - Don't go. I just want to look into your eyes. - Jojo, you need to understand... - Just for a minute. This is weird. This is really weird! OK. Let me go. Jojo, you need to let go of me. Jojo? OK, Jojo. All right. Let me go. Jojo. Jojo, would you let me go?! OK, OK. OK. You can at least now say you tried to resist. You have to leave. I mean, now! ♪ Let me feel you touching Come closer, baby ♪ You have to leave. Timi's going to come any moment from now. So, what? So he's left, so now he doesn't remember me? After he's slept with me, now he doesn't remember? I cease to exist, right now. "I'm just going to get happy. Oh, happy family! He-he-he!" Your wife is walking around, "Randy, Randy!" And he's kissing the wife. OK. Going out? Yeah. I have to get to the office. It's a Saturday, Randy! Ray is at the park, playing, but you know he likes you going with him for swimming lessons. I know, I know. This won't take long, I promise. Who is she? Is she really worth it? What the hell are you talking about? You know damn well what I'm talking about! The lady who called a few minutes ago said she was calling about a property you had made enquiries about. Then you on the other hand say that is your friend's sister who is looking for a job. Oh, and while you are processing that, why don't you tell me why on the 18th of July you were supposed to have flown out to Johannesburg for a business summit, but according to your company documents I found in the bloody wardrobe, that conference happened a month prior to the time. Get talking, Randy. - I'm waiting! - Look, it's not what you think. Then what is it?! What is it?! Can we please not do this now? I really have to get to work. Oh, why not? Give it a shot! Come up with the perfect lie. Or at least find the balls to tell me the truth! What, you want the truth? You want the truth? The truth is that for a very long time you and I have been extremely distant. When was the last time we actually had our arms around each other? Oh! You know, maybe if you were not so busy chasing those dirty whores out there, you would actually find time to work on your marriage. Now, I'm only gonna ask you this once. Who the hell was that lady who called? Who is she? - Hi. - Hi. - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. - Is this Randy Otoo's residence? - Yes. Great. - You must be his wife, Ama. - Yes, I am. Wonderful. Now I see. Honestly, he talks about you all the time. And I was like, honestly, "Who's this lucky woman!" Are you the actress? Yes, I am. Ah-ha! I knew I'd seen this face somewhere before. So, I always run into your husband at my fiancé's office. - And, um... - OK. I told him that I'm shooting a movie and I was scouting for locations. He suggested his residence and asked me to take a look around whenever that I was ready. Oh, I see. Um... Well, I'm sorry, but he didn't mention it. It must have slipped his mind. - I guess so. - Yes. You know how men can be! And, um, what is your name again? Chioma Williams. Oh, yes, yes, yes! I've seen one of your movies before. Sorry, um, give me one minute, please. - Sure. - OK. Stupid bitch. Randy, if you're going to be giving our home out to people for film shoots or whatever, at least have the courtesy to let me know. I have a privacy to protect. Ama, what are you talking about? What's... What's all this? What are you talking about? What film shoot? Chioma Williams, she's outside. She said you gave her the house for a film. Randy? Randy? Are you OK? Yeah, uh... Yeah, uh... She-she told me... Look, I'm sorry. I... I... should have told you about it. There's just been a lot on my mind. She's here? Well, it's OK. You've already told her she can use the place, so there's nothing I can do about it. And please, tell her they can film anywhere, but definitely not our bedroom. - What the hell are you doing here?! - What do you think? I came to see you. - I was on my way! You should have waited! - Well, I'm already here. Chioma, you have to leave. My wife is already... Don't you dare use that "wife" line on me. I can count the number of times you have told me that marrying her was a bloody mistake. OK, OK, you know! I know, but things are happening. You have to leave! You... Please! Look... Oh, hi. I'm sorry I forgot to ask, but can I offer you something? - She was just leaving. - Nothing, please. Um, I just want to take a look around and take pictures. Oh, great. Let me show you around, then, starting from outside. - Yes, please. - OK. So, you know, we would pay attention to the garden... So, what's the movie about? - Huh? - I mean, the storyline. Uh... yeah. It's called... The Triangle. It's an emotional thriller which revolves around a man, his wife, and his mistress. Another thing about a man leaving his wife for an opportunist? Not quite. It's different. It's centered on the undermined fact that no matter how long people are married, if they're not meant to be together... they will never be together. So you mentioned a fiancé? Yeah. Wedding bells anytime soon? Hopefully. He still has a few things to take care of. I see. "A few things to take care of." Um, I don't mean to pry, but when you say "things", um, things like...? What things is he taking care of? It's a lot to tell. But woman to woman, the thing is... Good. So you-you you-you... you-you-you-you like the place? You like it? It's nice? It's perfect. Works for all the characters. Great. Then I guess you can have it. But please let me know in time so I can tell the madam of the house. Uh, Chioma, I think it's best to take your number, so we can be directly in touch. - That would be great! - Yes! - OK. Let me go get my phone. - OK. What are you doing? Playing by the side-chick rules and being friends with the main chick. - You better give her the wrong number. - And why would I do that? Because I don't want you two to be in touch! Obviously! Aw! I'm not a fan of polygamy as well, but I believe we can all get along and be "fwiends!" Chioma, please, I'm begging you, don't do this. - Kiss me. - What? Kiss me and I don't. Not here, please. Not here, please. Kiss me. OK, OK? Please... OK, got it. What's wrong with our curtain, baby? I want to make sure enough light is coming down. No, no. Just leave it. I'll take care of it. - OK. All right. - Yeah. Um, OK, so what's the number? 0-5-0... 0-5-0. 7-2-3-5-6-3-1-3. Seven... OK, got it. Got it. Awesome. I will save it. Um, I gave my housekeeper some time off. So, um, you know, if you need to come, just give me 48 hours ahead of time. I'll make sure the place is squeaky clean. - Aw. - Yes. - Thank you so much. I will. - Pleasure. - It was really nice meeting you. - Nice meeting you too. Come on, what are sisters for? - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - Randy! - Yeah? - Thank you so much. I appreciate it. - Glad I can help. OK. Thank you. - Just... I'll... I'll see her out. - Sure. Hey, babe. - What took you so long? - Oh, babe, sorry. It was traffic. - You still on it? - Oh, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep. And, you know, there is a scene in it that will define my entire career. It's, like, a seven page scene of the most profound dialogues I have ever seen. Wow! You know, I kind of read a bit about it. I like the part where Patrick finally owns up and, you know, take the bull by the horn. And do the needful. Um, if you don't mind, I could... I-I could help you rehearse. I've still got some of the lines. Oh. Yeah, OK. You play Patrick and I'll be Nana. OK, so you play Patrick and I am Nana. Sure. Sure. I'm ready when you are. - OK. - You ready? - Yeah. - OK. It's been seven years, Nana. Seven inconsistent years, Patrick. Seven years where you didn't know what you wanted. Maybe then. Now I do. And you thought I was going to wait all my life for you? No. Destiny kept you for me. What are you doing? Kneeling before the woman I've truly ever loved. And wondering why I didn't ask this question seven years ago. Will you marry me, Nana? Oh, my gosh, babe! That was... That was so... That was so good! That was... Mwa! Bravo. Like, if it was an audition, you would so get the part! Oh, wow. I mean, looking at your eyes, I thought it was real! Yes, it's real. It's as real as it gets. Wait... what is this? Hey? Will you marry me, mon amour? Hey! So he did good, right? Don't you think, guys? It's... It's beautiful. Naadei? - Did you say yes? - Uh-huh! Well, I have a ring on my finger. OK, great. We have a wedding to plan, then. Guys, can you be a little more convincing? He-he! Nothing? I'm sorry, but... I've never liked this guy. I can't hide it. You know you've not been your normal self. Plus, you're reading a book. Can't I read a book? Well, you only do things like reading a book after an emotional surge or meltdown. Timi, listen... I know you managed to get a 2:1 out of your psychology department in Legon. But you can go and do your practice elsewhere. Jojo said he was here. Who? Jojo. He said he was here. You gave him pointers on how to do screenplays and you were really helpful. Yes, I... I did. I did. And so, honestly, what do you think about him? What do I think about who? Him! I mean, do you think he's got the potentials? Because he's been going on and on about his writing. I think he's a fantastic writer. And, um... with a little push, he's gonna go places. OK, settled then. What is settled? He said he wants to be coming here twice or thrice a week... for me to see his progress, because he wants me to help him. Oh. I see. Randy? Randy, open the door! Randy! - What's going on? - You can't leave me, Randy. You just can't! You can't leave me, you hear? - You can't leave me! - What is wrong with you? Just leave me! - You can't leave. - My wife is around! She's not! She texted me that she was going to her aunty for a few days. And she wanted to know when we'd start the shoot, so I should let her know. So fuck it, Randy, I know we're alone! Have you... Have you been drinking? Did you drive like this? No. I took an Uber. Do you think I want to die, so you can get another side piece? Chioma, listen to me. Listen, listen. Listen, I know it's hard, but listen. - You have to... - Leave me! Make love to me, please. - Just make love to me. - What? This is ridiculous! Please, I love you. Please. Come on, this is ridiculous. This is ridiculous! Please, make love to me. I love you, I love you, I love you. You can't leave me. Please, just... Don't leave me. I love you. I love you. Fuck me. - Say you'll leave me. - I won't leave you. - Say it! - I won't leave. - Say it again! - I won't leave. Hello. It's nobody. Yes, I came home to pick up some documents. - Baby, baby... - No, don't stop! OK, I'll be back shortly. I didn't know you were home. I thought you went out in the SUV. Oh, uh... Kofi took it out for a servicing. OK. Babe, babe, babe, listen, I... I'm sorry for the way things have been. I... I've been a jerk, OK. And I want to start over. New commitments, new everything. - Just... Just like how... - Are you OK? I'm fine. I... I'm fine. I've just been thinking a lot about our marriage, and I just really want us to be good. Just how we were before. Please, let's talk about this when I get back. - Babe, I've been... It's been on my mind. - Please. Please. You're awake. Timi said you were sleeping, so I didn't want to bother you. Where is she? She went out to get something. Can we talk? Talk about what? About... me and... and you. This never happened. Are you trying to make yourself believe that? We're not going to have this conversation. - And why? - Don't ask me questions! I saw what you were trying to do. You're replaying it in your mind. Wanting it. And at the same time detesting. Don't come any closer. What have I done wrong? What have I done wrong? Is it my fault I like you the way I do? I mean, every time in my life I'm always rejected or abandoned... Hey, hey, hey. - No... - Jojo, listen, listen. Look at me. Look at me. It's not like that, OK? Naadei, I love you. I love you. Naadei! Oh, I'm so sorry. I didn't want to wake you up. I had a call to submit the forms for the film festival. I left out the passport pictures. I'm here to get them. I have an Uber waiting. I hope he's not bothering you? No, no! No, not at all. Um... my passport. My passport, my... Passport pictures, not your passport. Oh, passport pictures. Yes. Um... So just go upstairs, OK. Um... you know, my... my bedroom. The closet... My closet. Just check where the jewelry is. OK. All right. See you guys later. - Jojo, be careful. - Mm-hmm. - Don't stress my superstar. - Mm-hmm. Wow. Oh, my God! Where did you learn this from? Right question. Wrong timing. This just came in from our contact in the press. - What is it? - You might want to take a look at it. No. So that's it? It's all over? Don't look away from me, Randy. I want you to look me in the eye... and tell me that it's over. If you can't say the words... then you might as well just walk through that door. And I will assume that we are never to see each other again. ♪ Break me down, break me down Break me down ♪ ♪ Break me down ♪ Randy! ♪ Break me down, break me down Break me down ♪ ♪ Break me down ♪ ♪ Break me down ♪ OK. So let's make it, like, 12.00, thereabouts. 12.00, 12.00 should be fine. All right, so I'll let you know when I'm leaving, OK? Bye. Hey, Greg. - Hi. - Remember me? - Um... - We were on set a few months ago. I played as Jay's friend. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I do remember you. You kind of look different now. - Yeah? - Kind of added a bit of weight. Oh, yeah? Oh, my butt and my hips? You know, squats do the magic. Anyways, I didn't really get the chance to talk to you because Jay was always around you. I even tried a few winks, but you didn't even seem to notice. I know. Can I have your number? Sure. There we go. So if you don't mind, you can come visit me at my place sometime. Sure, um... Friday night is cool. I'm always half drunk and horny. - Hey, Donna! - Hi, Nicky. How are you? Oh, wow, I love your dress! - You look amazing! - Thank you. - Have a nice day. - You too. What's with the excitement? I wish I knew. She's been like this all day. If I were you, I will watch my back, because when they are excited like this, they are going to fire you. Hello, girls! How are we doing? How are we doing? How are you? How are we doing? How are we doing, girls? The list won't be out until next week, Miss Naadei. So kill the excitement already. Oh, who cares about nominations? So what's with The Sound of Music? Well, I'm just thankful that I'm alive, I'm healthy, I've got amazing friends, like you guys! Life is good! What's up with this one? Did somebody die? Oh. Good morning, Naadei. Hey, good morning! How are you? How are you?! How are you?! Listen, I've got this really cool wig I want to show you. OK? So, come with me. Bye, guys! Oh, my goodness! A beautiful day! You have been on this phone since you got here. Girl, what's the story? You just downloaded WhatsApp? So funny! Oh, not what you said. I just got a message. OK, Naadei, since you want us to ask you, we will ask. Who is he? Who is who? The one who sending you all the jokes. Just a friend. Mm! "Just a friend." You know, Randy and I were friends. This is how we started. We were just... We're ready to go, ladies. Come on, let's get this commercial shot. You know... as much as you try to hide it, it's still very glaring. What are you talking about? You've had this mood for the past week. You don't talk to me and you barely notice our son. You're exaggerating. You know, I am reading a very interesting book. You want to know the title? It says... "Why Men Think Women Are Fools." You forgot to sign out of your computer in the study. And I saw all your emails, your trips, your hotel bookings. Hotels are usually booked under the name Randy Otoo... and Chioma Williams. That's not how it's gonna be like. Don't take it like that. Oh, yes, yes. Yes. I guess she just walked in. Anyways, I just want to remind you about Friday. I'm really looking forward to it. I know you know why. OK, OK. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for looking out. Are you OK? Yes, baby. Um... It was, um, the guy from my other set. The last set I was on. He... Oh. Who was he, you said? Um, one of the actors. He called to tell me there was an upcoming audition. Uh-huh. OK. Hey, baby, come on. Looking good, baby. Jojo, what are you doing here at this time? Um, I came... Oh, no, I asked him to come. I wanted us to watch a movie together. So he can work on his screenplay and writing skills. - Really? - Yeah, really. OK, so I'm gonna get the hard drive. - OK. - OK? - I'll be in your living room, then. - Cool, cool, cool. Naadei, why aren't you answering your calls? I've been calling you! Ah, excuse me. I wasn't talking to you. I'm sorry, who the hell are you? Don't worry about it. That's Timi's little cousin. Wow. Wow! "Timi's little cousin." Jojo, what are you doing here? OK. What's going on? What the hell was that? What the hell was that?! Don't you dare! Don't dare shout at me! How dare you call me "little"! In front of your friends? Why?! I had to call you that. - How? Why? - We were in public! - And so? - I've got an image to protect! You beg in my arms and now you're calling me little? I thought you loved me! Can you just stop? Can you stop it? Yes, I know that I am fond of you and all that, and, you know, you've given me a few orgasms here and there, but wake up, little boy! This is the real life! Listen, whatever happens between us stays between us. It cannot go out! Rubbish. Fuck! Fuck! Naadei! What is wrong with you? This is wrong with me! What... the... hell? What is this? Naadei, why? Why? I don't know! I... How? This is wrong! Done. I am so done. Naadei, why? I'm sorry I didn't tell you this, but Jojo is... He had troubled early teenage years... and has a bit of a psychosomatic condition. He's emotionally unstable. The question now is what do we do? Well, we call the fixer. In the early hours of this morning, a picture of one of our acts surfaced on the internet in a sexually compromising position with a younger boy. It's been trending for two hours. It's a dent on her reputation and I want it fixed. George, I need you to find that boy before anybody else does. I want hackers on their keypads. I want that page compromised and I want it brought down. I also want ten major bloggers... alerted in ten minutes. Now, the story is that the said picture was taken on a movie set and uploaded on the internet to create media hype. I want a script edited to have a scene that reflects that theme. And I want the entire set of journalists, I want cast, I want crew, as soon as possible. And I want Naadei, lastly, to grant a press conference. I want her collaborating our story that it's only a movie and that the title... is Boy Daddy. There's one other place I think he might be. Hmm? Where? His late mother's house. It's an abandoned property in Achimota. No, no, no, no, no. They need to know. They have to know. They had to know. She made me do it. She made me do it. She made me do it. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. They need to know. They need to know, they need to know. No, no, no, no, no! It's not my fault, it's not my fault! They need to know! I had to let them know. I had to let them all know. Oh, no, no, no, no. They just had to know! They just had to know, they just had to know. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I had to let the world know. They need to know. They need to know how much I love you. They need to know. They just had to know. We have the boy. I want a replica set built. I want that scene shot. And I want it out in an hour. And I want a graphic that says, "Coming soon!" It's just a movie. And do you think there won't be any harm done to your reputation given the fact it's negative publicity? I was just playing a role. And as the character demanded, I had to give it my very best. So that's exactly what I did. This photograph does not represent who I am... and what I stand for. If there's anything I want you all to remember, it's this: It's just a movie. That will be all, ladies and gentlemen. No further questions. Thank you very much for coming. Thank you very much. Thank you. Great. Let's get that movie wrapped in four days. And find a free online platform to screen it. That should put the nail on the casket for good. Bye. Fixed! But it won't come easy next time, ladies. Like I said, you need to be careful. Thank you so much. I really appreciate this. Hmm-hmm? One more thing. The boy, he's been sent to a restricted facility. You are never to see him again. So, in the bid to tie up all these loose ends, is there anything anyone has to tell me? Hello. What is it? Speak! I was involved with a married man. His name was Randy. - Randy... Otoo. - Otoo. We broke it up a few weeks ago. But his wife found out. And I don't know how. But she has threatened to go public with information. Well... Let's see if we can fix it. You got something you want to tell me? No. Oh, come on. It's quite obvious there's something you want to talk about. You want to share? I mean, I'm all ears. Well, I should ask you really if there's anything you want to share? I don't understand. What do you mean by that? Does the name Abi ring a bell? - Abi? - Mm-hmm? Abi. - Abi? - Abi. Who is... Who is Abi? Hey, Jay! - Hey, girl! - Hi! - Looking good! - Thank you, darling. - Honey. - What's up? Well, good job. - I'm glad to assist. Any time. - Bravo. So, my dear Greg, this was a little test. And a test that you failed miserably. - Cheers! - Bye. - Her name is Mrs. Ama Otoo. - Mm-hmm. Housewife. Not much of a career woman. Hmm. No social media pages. Little or no well-known affiliations. She a tough nut to crack? - Mm-hmm. Looks like it. - What else do we have on her? There was a little issue with a surrogate before their son was born. OK. She actually sued the hospital, with the matter later amicably resolved. Do we have a name? Yeah. A certain Joy Sarfo. That's right. Last-known address, Jamestown, British Accra. Hmm. - Ruffy... Find her! - I'm on it. Joy Sarfo? Yes? Who are you? Who I am is not as important as why I am here. How does the name "Ama Otoo" sound? I have a few questions. She couldn't have children. She didn't want her husband to know. So she paid me and took my egg. So as it is... you are saying that you are the real mother of Randy Otoo's son? Do as I say or this might get messy. Get out. - Mrs. Otoo. - Yeah. So nice of you to join us. I am so sorry. My, uh... My guys can be a little rough on the edges sometimes, but it comes with the territory. Please, please, please don't hurt me. Please. I will do anything. Oh, yeah, yeah, we'll get to that. I know you would. - But first of all, let's get introduced. - OK. My name is Wendy. And I'm the woman who knows your biggest secret. Your son. Please! Please! Please don't hurt my son. - Wait, what's his name? - Please! Ray. Oh, yeah. Ray. Yeah. Charming little boy. - Please! - No, no. I will never hurt Joyce's son. Aha! That's the reaction I was looking for. You see, that little boy is your only hold to Randy's fortune and empire. Now, we do not want that seeping into the media. Do we? - I'm sorry, I cannot hear you. - No. Exactly, yeah. So... Here's the deal. You will destroy every single piece of evidence that's linking Mitch Williams and your husband. Yeah. And maybe, if he's having a good day... your secret will be kept safe. Everyone's happy. I think that's a fair deal, don't you think? - Yes. - Yeah. I think so too. Get rid of the evidence. All of it. Let's go. And that is how she fixed us. But...
