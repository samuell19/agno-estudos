THE MINISTRY OF CULTURE OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION DROOG DROOGA FILMS OKKO STUDIOS True Olympics fans never take shortcuts. That's what the Skylero brothers say. These two lovely Scottish travellers rode all the way from their home country to Moscow on their bicycles. Mark Twain once said the hardest part of cycling... was dismounting. These brothers dismounted just fine. When they reached Moscow and hopped off their hot and dusty vehicles, our reporter Daria Khalzova... Nina... Nina... Nina... Nina! Nina, where are you? I'll knock your fucking teeth out. You're trying to make me feel guilty again! Nina... MARA Who is it? It's Andrey. Hello. Come on in. She's expecting you. Thanks. You can keep your shoes on. Come on in, Andrey. Good afternoon. Hey. Want some tea? Yes, please. Black or green? Black. I always drink tea during sessions. Must be nice working here. It's not work. More of a hobby. What do you do for work then? I grow mushrooms and herbs. Follow me. I only have one client. His office is right across the river. Must be reliable. Take a seat. So tell me. Did you expect a crystal ball or something? Just tell me what you want. Well, my wife Olya and I... moved out to the suburbs not long ago... Tell me what exactly you want. The details can wait. Well, if it's possible... I would like her... to forget what happened to us. You wanna erase someone's memory? Alright. Let's see what happened to you. Relax. Were you premature? Yeah. How did you know? I'm going to count to ten. Your job is to look me in the eye. One. Two. Three. Can I blink? Four. Five. You have arrived. Thanks for riding with us. You've chosen to pay by card. Here, I'll help. Pretending you have something to do with them? Look, I'm awfully sorry I forgot to bring flowers. Thank God I still have fans. Quite a few. Does that make you sad? It makes me a better person, babe. He won't mind, right? No, it's good for him. The more the better. Imagine yourself at nine months. Andrey, Andrey! Keep going. What do you want? Look, let's negotiate. Take what you want and leave, alright? We already did. We were about to leave. But we had a change of plan. - Stay quiet. - Don't! Andrey! Don't, she's pregnant! - We'll keep that in mind. - Don't move. No! Don't. Get a move on! Take her pants off! Andrey! Andrey! - Open the fuck up! - Andrey! Somebody! Help! Help! We're being assaulted! Somebody! How did you do that? So you want her to forget all that? It felt so real. It was real. Back then, though, not now. - Back when she was raped. - She wasn't. They didn't have time. I called for help. The neighbors came running. And? She lost the baby. Our baby. It's been a nightmare since. Why don't you just wait? I probably shouldn't have come. Sorry, I'd better go. Call me when you're ready. Goodbye. He's bad He's really bad He's a snake, and a frog, and a fox, and a rat He... He stabbed me in the heart And now we're Worlds apart - Hey! - Hi. Great concert! Yeah, the place was packed. Look, Andrey... Please stop coming here. - Olya, let's talk. - I'm tired of talking. Let's try couples therapy. - I wanna make an effort. - No! And then they told me, "Nah, she's a singer. Headed to a concert." Grushinsky Fest, was it? Then I heard your voice and fell in love. I promise I'll make every effort to always be by your side. I promise to always be there for you. So your voice stays like that forever. Hi there. Lock the door. Wait in the living room. Is this a bad time? It's OK. Take a seat. Help yourself. These are mushroom... and meat rolls. Give me a moment. Know where the myth about the witch who bakes kids into rolls is from? Enlighten me. A kind of incubator early Slavs invented. When a baby was born prematurely, they would wrap it in dough and put it in a warm oven to finish growing. I like you. You and your Olya. Her music is nice. How do you know she's a musician? The power of Facebook. Go get a mushroom from over there. There are two in the Petri dish to the left. Take one. Left corner. The two with the dark caps. That little guy will help you. What do I do with it? Put it in Olya's dessert. She'll eat it and start to forget. Wait, but how can we control it to make her forget just that thing? I'll take care of that. I'm leaving tomorrow for three months. Plants and fungi need high humidity. You're gonna maintain it. The spores in the apartment will get the job done right. Put it here. Wait, so you want us to house-sit while you're away? Works for me. When the job is done, you can pay what you think it's worth. Deal? - What if this doesn't work? - It will. Deal. Could you please take this to the dressing room? My wife has a show tonight. It's a dessert to surprise her. Sure. Leave it over there. - There? - Right. Who is it? It's me. Hi. Hi. How are you? Fine. Yourself? Fine. I mean, good. The cake was lovely. Thanks. I decided to start performing solo. That's fine. I mean, that's great! Way to go! Can I get you some tea? As long as we move somewhere else. Sounds good. Cool, isn't it? - For real? - Yeah. - In that building? - Yep. - But it's a mausoleum. - It's a constructivist landmark! They orginally planned to build it on that side. Opposite the Kremlin. With a pink marble facade. Like a Barbie house? Come in. I know. You can keep your shoes on. I will, too. Like it? Is this even legal? It sure is. I know the owners through a project. They want to do a makeover here. So we can... Yep, makes wishes come true. We can stay here until we find a place. - It's enormous! - Yeah. Look at this! No way. It's old. What's in there? It's locked. The owners left their stuff there. Some guy will stop by every month to use the archives. He won't bother us. Don't break it! I said you can keep your shoes on. We only have one key. I'll make you a copy. The owners have the other one. Wait... what's that? Something illegal? Well, that's new. So what do you think? I'm down for anything. Your ass sounds amazing. - Oh, you are so gross. - So gross. - You are disgusting. - I'm so disgusting. - Do we get any servants? - Servants? You already have one. Kirill! Hey! - What's up! - What's up. - Anything happen over the weekend? - You bet it did! Check it out. CONCERT 09/26, IMPRESSIONISM MUSEUM Good for her. Came back on Friday. Spent the weekend together. Like the old times, but better! Hey, a solo show is genuinely cool. I'm telling you... Not that I believe in it. I mean, I want to believe in it. It works. But it's impossible! Hey, don't overthink it. If it works, it works. Sweet Jesus it does. MAKING DUCK FOR DINNER I'm in the kitchen. I'm home. Brought you this. Thanks. Take a seat! Are you... cooking dinner? I am, why? Just asking. I mean, are you going to cook like this from now on? Is this duck? It's duck with apples. Here's the sauce. - Eat the duck first! - Oh, OK. We can take it with us. Are you eating in there? What's wrong? Nothing. Baby, baby, rest your head My little Olga, go to bed The cat will come to stay the night And tuck in Olga nice and tight Leave this place! Get her out of here! Who are you? Quiet! Or she'll hear you. How did you get in here? She'll trick you. Beware! Damn it! Olya! Olya! Olya! Olya! Olya! Good morning! What time is it? Office time! Come on! - Why didn't you wake me up? - Hey, I did cook breakfast! - Thanks. - Got toast, an omlette. - Coffee. - Thanks. Delicious. Right, I'm off. Where's my kiss? Your kiss, right. OK, see you. Hello? Can you hear me? Yes, hello. Sorry to bother you. Is this a good time? How're my fungi doing? You keeping them humid? I am. Look... So... Olya seems to be forgetting it little by little. But I keep seeing weird things in the apartment. They're ghosts of previous owners. - You could have warned me. - You're funny. This process can involve side effects. Did you think it was homeopathy? No. It's just... I'm lying to her. And I think it was a bad idea from the start. Then go see a therapist. But keep the humidity up. Keep it simple The first time around I feel the connection between us Hi. What's going on? - OK, see you. - Bye. - What happened? - I was missing you. Were you here a long time? Why not call? You were at work. So when can I hear your new song? At the concert. Can you fit that whole thing in your mouth? I can if you swim across the river after. Then do it. Fine. Holy crap! I didn't know you're a natural. The key is believing in yourself. Good luck! You'll freeze! Hey, I believe in myself. You'll get the cops called on you for flashing. Some riverboat will mince you up with its propeller while music plays. Think I should wait for a good song? Please, help! Anyone! He's trying to kill himself! Andrey, quit it! You'll die, get down! I will if you tell me you love me. I love you. Get down! Louder, I want everyone to hear it. I love you more than life itself! Please don't leave me! OK, fine. - Thank you! - Olya! Everyone's staring at me. Pretend it was part of the plan. My private parts are freezing. - I can warm them up. - Olya! - Olya, quit it! - The mantis is furious! I'll eat you. Come here, Olya! Hey, stop! What's the matter with you? - Damn it! - Hello. I know you wouldn't have jumped. You're a bad con artist! Oh yeah? Well you just got conned by this bad con artist. Andrey! Andrey! What are you doing here?! She's who you came to see the mistress about? Get out of the room! Why didn't you tell me you were coming?! What's up with your hand? I'm finished. I'm leaving. Your hand is bleeding. I'll be back in a month. Creep. He was supposed to give us a heads-up. Who was he? Seriously? I overslept again. Remember, I told you someone would come use the archives each month? What was with his hand? Why did he mention me? I don't know. He looked drunk and smelled like alcohol. Did you take his key? - I'll call the owners today... - You didn't take his key?! He said he was finished and left. What if he comes back? Olya... It's gonna be alright. Please don't go. I can't stay, I have a project due. It's important. I'll try to finish early. You'll be fine. Your kiss. Bye. Hi. I meant to tell you. Last night I dreamed that I was pregnant again. As if nothing had happened. I want to try again. Please come back soon. I want you to hear the new song that I'm going to perform live. Keep it simple Let's talk straight We're not gonna be friends Andrey, we need to decide on the facade color. Sure. Let's do it tomorrow. Olya. What's wrong? What's the matter? What happened? There, there... It's alright.. There, there... What's wrong? What happened? What's up? It's over, it's fine... Shhh... It's alright. It's OK. There, there... What's the matter? What is it? What is it? There, there... There, there... Calm down... Olya! Calm down. Why weren't you there?! Why weren't you there?! Look at me. I'm here. I got you. Everything's OK, you hear me? There, there... There, there... It's over now. It's over. I got you. Come here. It's over now. Olya. Olya, open up please. Olya. Olya, open up! Hello. I'm unavailable. Don't leave a message. I won't listen to it. Hello. I'm unavailable. Don't leave a message. Hello. I'm unavailable. Don't leave a message. I won't listen to it. This is Andrey. I can't reach you. Olya's not right. She remembers the accident, but not me in it. Call me back as soon as you can. No! Get a move on! Take her pants off! Andrey! Have you found it? Just a second. Got it. Here, it's lighter over here. Let's see, apartment 25. Half the apartments here are rented out these days. All sorts of people live here now. Back in the day, it was a place for the elite. Just hang on. Careful! This is a historic document! Right. 1938. The owner was... Mara Savatievna... Mazova. Sounds like an Old Believer name. And before that... the owner was a high-ranking secret policeman. - Any further records? - No, as I said, up to 1953, that's it. We're a museum, not the police archives. Alright, thank you so much. Have a good day. You're welcome. Wait, why were you asking?! Oh, it's nothing. Let's talk about the gable design and the scale of the carving. Oh, and here's Andrey, the project head. Nice to meet you! Excuse us. Can we have a word? I'm sorry. I'll be back shortly. You nuts? They're here from out of town! I know. Look, I can't get through to her. Who? I checked the national property register. Looked online to find the owner. There's no information. Like it doesn't exist! What's even her name?! Andrey, what is going on? Olya's not right. She's stressed about the concert. That's normal. Thanks for the input. Just tell me where to find her! I don't know. I've never met her. Watched one of her lectures online. Are you kidding me? You were totally screwed. I didn't know how to help you. - Olya is going crazy, OK! - This isn't about Olya! I only told you about her to help get your head straight! Sure, you ran away, so what? Big deal. I'd have done the same! - You done? - Yes. Thanks. ANDREY MUSEUM OF RUSSIAN IMPRESSIONISM Hello. Hi, I'm here for the concert. - I must be on the list. - Your name? Andrey Shelestov. I'm afraid you're not on the list. That's odd. It's my wife's show, I just can't get through to her. - Hold on... - That's her! Olya! Sir, excuse me! Olya! - Sir, excuse me, sir! - Olya, hi! It's OK! Hi! How are you? Sorry, have we met? Are you serious? Take a seat, we're starting soon. Is this a joke?

ZARYA Baby, baby, rest your head But don't lie down on the edge Or the grey little wolf will arrive And take a bite out of your side Baby, baby, rest your head My little child, go to bed Iill sing you a lullaby - Go to sleep my little boy - Excuse me. Baby, baby... - You're causing a... - Where is she? - Sir, take your seat. - There was a girl right here. Sir, step outside. Did you see her? Did she leave? Rockabye baby... OLD BELIEVERS OLD BELIEVERS Don't go there! She set the whole thing up. To make you come here. What does she want? She wants to be young forever. So that nobody finds out who she really is. She'll trick you and Olya. You can't make a deal with her. Let's go. I'll show you. Let's go! Follow me. Read it. It's OK. Read it. Aglaya Fedorovna Chunayskaya. Pyotr Avvakumovich Chunaysky. Agripina Petrovna Seraya. Natalia Pavlovna Kurashova. Pavel Pavlovich Kurashov. Sentenced to death. Any final words? You're just kids. Little blind puppies. You'll burn in hell for this. There is no hell. That's what you taught me. Father. Is that you? Mara! - Ready! - Is that you?! - Lord, have mercy on us! - Aim! Please! Fire! Andrey, find Olya! Quick, get up! Find Olya! Don't ever let her come here. And don't ever come back. We're closed! - Closed! - What? Closed! Come back tomorrow! We're closed. Olya! POLICE Hello. I'd like to report a missing person. HELP DESK Excuse me. My wife is missing. - Excuse me, could you... - Ask the help desk. Follow me. Hello, my wife is missing. She's been acting odd since we rented this woman's apartment. And now she's gone missing. Here it is. The wardrobe. I climbed in and found another apartment behind it. - All weird and abandoned... - Khomyachkov! Take care of this. Take this. You heard the story, right? I'll log it and call you back. - Please wait outside. - I already did the paperwork. - And handed it in. - Please wait outside. - Are you hard of hearing? - No, I... Then go wait outside! Can't you start searching?! Sir, can't you hear him? Wait outside! RAMBLER SEARCH MARA PSYCHIC Let's start with how your power works. It's not a power. It's a skill. Plus knowledge of biology, anatomy, and mycology. My work focuses on mushrooms. And no, fungi aren't just for psychedelic trips. FUNGI MEMORY LOSS You won't believe how powerful common white mushrooms are. Where do you get them? They'll grow anywhere. Provided humidity is high. I have my own farm next to a water tower. Though I grow rare species at home. For tricky cases. Like what? Mushrooms can heal deep emotional traumas. WATER TOWER ARCHITECTURE - Restore people's hope and happiness. And vice versa? Can they hurt people? It's like therapy. Only if the client consents. And who'd want to hurt themselves? Where's Olya? Found the tower, did you? Take a seat. Just look at this mess! I said, where's Olya?! Almost. Almost what? Almost ready. Let's go. Where? Follow me. Hey! It's OK. I fed you some napping mushrooms. You'll come round soon. What did you ask the mistress for? To make Olga forget. Forget about what? That we were assaulted and she lost our baby. Were you there, too? I was. Chickened out, did you? That's why she chose you. What did you ask her for? I asked her to make things right. But she took her. My dear Nina. Couldn't you do anything? Why not call the police? You can only find her if she wants you to. I'm gonna trade you for Nina. Let her gobble you up. You'd better walk when we get there. Try anything and I'll stick you. Name? Olga. Olga, I baptize you in the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Amen! Next. Names? Olga and Ivan. You'll kill him like that. You're a bad mother. Olga and Ivan, I baptize you in the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Amen! Next. May I? Go ahead. Keep moving. Nina! It hurts! No! This'll turn you right over to her. Stop! Nina! His wife will be here soon. I'll trade them for you. Konstantin, I can't. Don't hurt anyone else. OK. Right. I need a drink. Is Olya coming too?! What does he want?! Where did you think you were, a fairy tale? - Konstantin, leave! - Hang on! I'll get you out of here. Konstantin! Let him go! Look what you did to your man! Move! Move! Try anything and you get what they get. Solve my riddle and you're free. Which kid should the parents eat for dinner? Olya should be here any minute! Olya! Olya! Olya, I'm in here! Olya! Calm down. Olya! Andrey. Andrey, help me. Help me. Get me out of here. Did you solve the riddle? Get up! The investigator wants you. We moved the wardrobe. Nothing there. Apartment next door belongs to a woman who lives abroad. We talked to her. She kindly agreed to show us around once she gets back. What's her name? Mara? What does it matter? It wasn't her who pushed the girl. It wasn't me, either. Why would I? I've heard your account. Here's the deed to the apartment. It's from last Friday, in the name of Andrey Shelestov. A day before the ex-owner was pushed out the window. But I never signed any papers. I can't hold you here any longer. Someone gave the Chief a call about you. Who did? A woman? Take him away! So I'm free to go? Go. I'll lock you up sooner or later. - Get out! Go away! - Wait. - Get out of here! - Where's Olya? You idiot! You're gonna die here! Hush! Be quiet! Please, please! Hush! Hush! Where is Olya? Quiet! She'll hear you. What does she want? She wants you to suffer. She feeds on your guilt. Why me? You did what her father did. Did what? Why did she shoot him and the other villagers? Take my hand. Get up! Come on, get up! You taking all the cattle?! We'll die if you take the horses! I'll go with you. But leave the horses here, or they'll starve. Mom, Mommy! - It's alright, it's alright. - Mara, come here! If you want to bargain, give me the best offer. I'll do anything you want! Fine, Father. So be it. I'll leave you half of the horses. You save the village. - But I want your prettiest daughter. - Dad, no! No! - No! - What are you doing, monsters?! Mom, Mommy! - Mom! - Lord is watching! Lord will punish you! I'll take her. But she's a child! Don't! - Dad, Daddy! - What are you doing?! - Help me! - Let go of her! - Dad! Please! - Do something already! - Dad! - Save the child! - Dad! - Lord, have mercy! - Let me go! - Mara! - I curse you! - We're already cursed. Let's move, boys! - No! - Monsters! No! Burn in hell! Mara! Mara! Who's that? Who's that? Go away, Andrey. You remember me? Let's leave. She told me everything. Why you came to see her. You can't be here. They'll be back. Who will? They come every night now. Olya! What's taking so long? When I first saw you... I though you were so funny. - Get the horse meat. - Shapeless clothes. "Must be a hiker," I thought. And then they told me, "Nah, she's a singer. - Here to kill me? - Headed to a concert." - Stay here. - Grushinsky Fest, was it? What are your songs even like? I'm here for Olya. - And then... "I'm here for Olya." - I heard your voice. - Why the long face? And fell in love. "I promise... I'll make every effort... to always be by your side. I promise... to always be there for you. So your voice stays like that forever." You really love her, huh? I do. Prove it! What do you want me to do? Pass a test and she's free to go. Fine. Andrey! - Stay quiet. - Olya! Get a move on! Take her pants off! Andrey! Take her pants off! Jesus! That's awful! Horrible! How could they do that? It's not real! Oh, you wish. - Look, they're about to pound her. - It's not real! Oh, it's real, alright! That's a bad cut. It's deep! But things are even worse for her! Look! I can help you both. And make it stop. I'll save her. In exchange for you eating a mushroom. And forgetting what you've just been through. Once you've recovered... you'll get one more chance. I agree. Let her go. Deal. Andrey! Andrey! How cute! I'll give you two a moment. I'm so sorry. Look at these lovebirds! Please, I beg you, let him go! He came here on his own! Hold up your end of the deal! Or do you want to see her get banged again? Quit it already. Or I'll call in my guys. Olya. She wants me to take mushrooms to forget. But itis a trick. I'll have to come back here again and again. So I always feel guilty for what I did to you. You go. Iill stay here. I'm so sorry! Now go! You hear me? Get out! - Go, Olya! - Enough of that! Olya! Trying to play with me? Bitch! Let go of her! Transform! Transform! This way, this way! Andrey, Andrey! Andrey... Are you OK? I'm fine. Marry me. I mean, again? You're a fool! I'm serious!
