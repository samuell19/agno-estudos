Okay, so I'm watching TV, like a year ago, all right? I'm watching one of those, fucking, history channel shows, trying to learn shit. And I stumbled... You ever hear about African Jews? - African Jews? - Yeah, no, all right, no. - Nigga wants everyone to be a Jew. - Checks this out. Checks this out. All right? So, these are black Jews, all right? They're stranded in the middle of Ethiopia. - It's deep shit. - Stranded? Yeah, look, they got nothing. They don't got cars, they don't got shit. And I'm watching this, and I'm like - what the fuck are these guys wearing? Look. It's on the tower over there, it's everywhere, right? What the fuck?

This is a huge game, That's why he's going so crazy up there. I’m tempted to wrangle the kids downstairs right now and get it over with. You really wanna do that? I don't know how sensitive that is. You're calling me insensitive? I thought we both agreed that we wait till after Passover. Next you’ll be saying you wanna wait until after the summer. I’m not opposed to waiting till after summer. It's commercial, can't you just put the game on for two, fucking, minutes? Till my car gets here? Let's not chop the body. No words to describe that. 41? I don't know how old these guys are, but you can't tell by their age. This is crazy. Here is KG hitting the shot from outside. He’ll be 36 on Saturday.

We know for a fact, that you placed a bet with that money. - I never placed a bet with that money. - Yes, you did. - No, I didn't. - No, let me ask you something. I heard that Beni and Eddie are going to Timberlake. And you know what else I heard? I heard you've resurfaced your, fucking, swimming pool.

Fucking shit! Fuck. It's okay. Thank you. Okay? Sorry. I'll meet you right back inside. It's all good now. Let me get dressed. What could you possibly be looking for in the forest, dressed in such thin paper rags? My wicked stepmother has condemned me to die, lest I fill this basket with roses before the coming of the dawn. Besides our cottage is our magic garden. It protects the roses from the snow. Go now and fill your basket to your heart’s content. - Dad, what the fuck? - Just watch you, fucking, sister's play. Thank you! We must bestow a gift upon her! I know! Every time she speaks, gold coins shall spill forth from her mouth. This will be our gift! Quick! He approaches now. This is Danny's part, he's coming out. Hark! Who goes there? He did so good. Fuck me. Jesus Christ. - Hello. - Hey, you picked up? When I block the caller you pick up, when you know it's me you don't? What is that all about? Nah, I knew it was you, Howard that’s why I picked up. Hey, where’s my, fucking, gem? Hey, you need to calm down. Nothing’s happening with you acting like this. Listen motherfucker. I want my, fucking, property, you understand me? Hey, watch your mouth, all right? You’re not dealing with some broke ass niggas. You, fucking, put me on that bus ride home. You think that was funny? What, the fuck, was that all about? That, fucking, bus was disgusting! What explaining you want me to do? I'd go with you to locker-room, with your silly ass it makes me look really, fucking, suspect. - Where's my gem? Where is it? - I’m trying to help you, not fuck everything up. Jesus. I have it on me, right now. You have it on you? Yes, I’m about to be back in the city.

Barbecue chicken? So, I wanted to talk about the trunk scenario. It was, literally, the most awkward thing, like... Where are you going? I'm heading into the city. Late night event. - Kinda go... - It's the cake? Until 2, 3, you never know anymore. So, I'll be exhausted tomorrow. Yeah, okay, sure. Good night. Anyway, I'll finish the conversation later, but it was, literally, so awkward, like... Who are you talking to? Jessica. Hi Jessica. How good was our girl tonight? You can't hear her. Okay, then, just hang up for a second, let me talk to you, 2 secs. I'll call you back. What? I was very proud of you tonight. You were beyond incredible. Yeah, you told me like 5 times already. Well, I just wanted to... You really really didn't know how proud I was, okay? So I really, I just really really want you to know. Okay, well, I do. Everything is cool, right? What do you mean? I don't know, I just. Thought I would check in with you. Okay. Make sure everything's good. Why wouldn't I be good? I don't know, I just thought I'd check in. Okay, well, I, literally, don't know what you are talking about, so... That's right, 'cause I'm an idiot. So you love me. Okay I'm gonna get into the city. - I'll see you in the morning. - Have fun. Like I always do. Anyway, what were I saying? You know it was like a complete resting bitch face, so... Hey, Demany, where... I didn't see you out front, I don't, fucking, see you in here now. I can't believe I'm still looking for you. Just, pick up your, fucking, phone, man. I don't understand this! Don't fuck with me here. Hold on. Stop the music. Stop! Would somebody pass the Weeknd the mic? Where, the fuck, is the blacklight? What's going on back there? No, I asked for blacklight. I'm not performing till it's, fucking, blacklight on this, fucking, stage. Call out the blacklight. Blacklight. Close on with the Weeknd to those, who turn on the blacklight. Blacklight. What's going on back there? I'm puzzled. That's what I'm talking about. Hey, Demany! Demany! Howard, I want you to meet, my nigga, James. I've been hearing about you. Yo, where's that opal?

Why, the fuck, are you here, if you don't have the opal? Same, fucking, reason as everybody else is here, to see the, fucking, Weeknd perform. You got a problem with that?

She's trying to sell this thing to the Weekend. - You understand? - Yeah. What do you mean "yeah"? Where is she now? - Yeah. - But where? Where? I don't mean to get in you business, I don't wanna get involved, but I saw her go to bathroom with Weeknd. Julia! - Oh shit! - Julia, are you in there? Yo, I said to hold the door, bro. Open up the door! - Someone's in it. - Shut the fuck up! Give me one second, I need to wash my hands. - What the fuck is this? - Howard we were just doing coke. Nothing happened! Let go!

It is not you who should be looking at it, it's me. Turn that down. Let me explain something to you, Mr. Ratner. Your opal is one of the 75 items I have to oversee for this auction. All of them but yours have been cleaned, cataloged and appraised. Listen, I'm doing some appraisals of my own, okay? And then I’m gonna bring it to you today. I am on the precipice of pulling it. - I swear to you, please, okay? - End of the day or we’re done. I'm getting a call right now, so I have to go. This is Howard Ratner. Hi, Janet, thank you so much - for calling me back so quickly. - Yeah, no problem. That message you left was actually very disturbing. No, I didn't mean to worry you. Okay, would you mind telling me what this is about? I saw online that your boss represents Kevin Garnett? - I'm gonna have to put you on hold for one moment. - Okay, sure, I'll hang on. - Howard, Julia's on line 1. - No. No, tell her no. I'm not here. Fuck it! Where are you? Why aren't you answering your phone? I asked you a question, where are you? I stayed at Kat’s house, where else do you think? I couldn’t, fucking, go home with you acting that way. No, that's... So, let me guess, you're not coming to work today? I would like to. That must be nice to come to work whenever you feel like it. - Howard. - Is that good, is that good? Maybe, you should take a nap then? - Can't we just... - Take a nap, get your rest... you need to remain attractive, right? Answer me. I just wanna sit down and talk to you, Howard. - Okay. - I don't wanna do this right now. - I don't wanna play. - And I just need to work, okay? I need to work to make sure that your cheating ass is taking care of. - ... personnel on line 2. - Goodbye! This is Howard Ratner. My assistant told me that you called? How are you doing? I'm not gonna lie to you, I could be better. Sorry to hear that, so what can I do for you? I've been having a situation with one of your higher profile players. And I'm moments away right now from making things very ugly for you. - Okay, can you hang on for a second? - No, I'm not hanging on. I happen to be a litigious individual, and I'm a second away from hanging up right now - and calling my lawyer and the police... - Whoa, whoah, whoah. - You realize I have no idea what you’re talking about. - Howard, KG is here with Demany.

Get him his fucking ring. He’s got shit to do, come on! - Oh, the ring, the ring... - He's got a game, Howard. Oh my God, no, I left the, fucking, ring in Long Island. What, the fuck, do you mean you left it in Long Island? I'll give it to Demany. - I don't have time for this. - I'll give it to Demany. I'll give it to you. Listen, I can't do this.

So, whatever you meant by your little link, I meant when I said that I want you out of my apartment tonight. And I want confirmation, by text, not a link. Via text, "Howie, I am gone, 10 PM". Don't you, fucking, call me! Arno, what the fuck? Can we just, fucking, talk? We're family, we're here, right now. Out of my way. Yeah, not so tough without your friends around, are you? Are you? Fucking pussy! - You like, you love this roster? - I love it. Baron Davis is done. Let's start fresh: Melo, Amare. - What about Lin? - That's it. We gotta bring back Lin. You know what, fucking, Lin’s not coming back next year? Cause Dolan saw how everybody were so fucking happy, - and said "how can I ruin that?". - Exactly! Howard, fucking, knows. You realize that I met my wife at the first game that started Linsanity. You know what he says to me. He comes over to me and says "Happy Holidays". Like it's Christmas. It's like having an intruder in your own home. He's not bothering anybody, all right? He's trying. Easy for you to say, he didn’t marry your daughter. This is, KG, huh? Off. Three for eleven? What the fuck? He looks tortured. That, fucking, guy tried to steal an opal from me. - Your opal? Your opal It came? - The opal came, yeah. Stupidly, I lent it to this motherfucker and he's... What do you mean? He took it? He stole it? He didn't steal it, he got carried away. He thinks it has magic powers. Magic powers? - No, really? - Look, look at him tonight. Without it, he didn't have it tonight, look how fucking bad he played. He wants to own it. So, I told him to come to the auction and, fucking, make a bid for it like everyone else. - When is this auction? - The auction is Monday. Okay, so what do you think it's worth? Well, listen, it's anywhere from a thousand to 3 thousand dollars a carat. And it's 6 hundred carats. That's over a million dollars. He's very rich. Not as rich as Gooey! But I’m working on it. Who’s comparing? Rich is rich. I made a crazy risk at a gamble and, it's about to pay off. Don't look at us, don't look at him, don't look at me. Find it yourself. Come on, keep looking. That's warm, warm, warm. Warmer. Very warm. Keep looking. I found it! That's my boy! Find your stuff, we're leaving soon. Let's show them. Dad, look, this is Mom's Bar mitzvah dress, it still fits her. Oh. That’s hysterical. It’s 9 o'clock, what do you think, we should get going? - Yeah let's go, tell the boys. - I told them. What? - You look gorgeous. - Oh God! I wanted to talk to you for a minute. Just sit down, and, we don't have to do it here. We'll wait, but I... I'm having very serious second thoughts. We're all together right now. We're all so comfortable, excited. Is it too late? Should we maybe... What do you think? Am I crazy? Are you serious right now? Yeah, I know, I know I fucked up. Yeah, you fucked up. You are a fuckup. And I'm not having this conversation. Please, stop, just stop for one second and just look at me, look at my eyes. And they'll tell you what I'm feeling. Please? What? What are you thinking? What? Tell me. I wanna know. I know. What? Your face is so stupid. - Okay. - Oh my God. I'm gonna leave her. I'll leave her. I don't need her. We're done. - Okay. - It's done. It was stupid. She's trash. She's trash. I know that. It was stupid. I'm done. I'm done. It means nothing. It meant nothing. Please. I'm begging, you just give me another shot. You know what, Howard? Say yes, what? I think you are the most annoying person I've ever met. I hate being with you. I hate looking at you. And if I had my way, I would never see you again. That's 'cause you're mad. You're mad and it makes sense. - You can punch me if you want. - Oh, thanks. I don't even want to touch you. Oh my God! Are you kidding me? Wait. Turn around. I wanna see. - Did you see that? - Oh my God! I hate you! That's how fit you're right now? I was fifteen pounds overweight! I'll get the car, okay? I'll get the car. She's always... Like we wanna see everything she's doing at every moment. - You think she's jealous of me? - Yeah, she wants your life. - She wants our house. - And she can have it. Why are you taking Lex? We'll take the tunnel, it’s better, less traffic. Plus, I wanna grab something from the apartment, and it’s right there. We gonna stop by the apartment, guys. Oh my God. - Daddy's got thinks to do. - Oh, it's so annoying. That business. - Hi, Mr. Ratner, how are you? - How are you? - Anything in the trunk? - I’m just gonna be up and down. - If you need anything let me know. - I gotta use the bathroom. Hold it in, all right? It's just 25 minutes before we're home. - I can't wait that long. - Don't be ridiculous. Eddie go upstairs and use the bathroom. I'm tired, I wanna go to sleep. You couldn't go at Grandpa's. You had to wait till now? Come on, we're going. We're going. Goddamnit. Bathroom’s all fucked up because of construction, so, I’m gonna ask a neighbor. Dad, I don't wanna use a neighbor's bathroom, I'm taking a shit. Have you ever seen the show Good Times? No. You, actually, gonna like this. This guy was the father on the show. - What? I don't care. - I showed it to you. He was in Coming to America. He’s probably sleeping, I bet he's an old man. - Who is it? - It's Howard, next door. I live in E. Hey, how are you? What's up? Unfortunately, my bathroom is all fucked up. And this kid's gotta go. Can we use yours for a minute? No, sorry. - What a, fucking, dickhead! - Hey, stop that. He's a, fucking, legend. - Hello? - Hi, I'm your neighbor. - Hey, how you doing? - How are you? - I'm your neighbor, I never introduced myself. - Allen, how are you? My bathroom is all fucked up and my son needs to use. Can he use yours for a second? Is it number one, or number two? - One. - He's gonna go one. All right? So, you go quick. All right, on the back. I'll meet you in the hallway. Julia? Have a nice life, I hope you find everything you're looking for. Yeah, I'm coming. Yeah. Come on, let's go. Who's the girl, living in your apartment? What did you say? Yeah, that guy told me there’s some hot chick living in your apartment. Who is that, mom? What were you doing, talking to that coke-head? - He was talking to me. - I told you to go in there and take a shit! - I did take a shit. - That was it. Get on the elevator. It’s enough already! Don't talk about that to anybody. - Did you get what you needed? - Yeah. Put the recycling in the garbage, before you come in the house. Big day. Magnolia bakery, from the downtown original. - Thank you. - Did you have these? Delicious. You tell everybody here thank you so much and they are welcome. - Will do. - And these are on me, Howard Ratner. What's this? This is the catalog for today? That's the one. - Stops right on me. - Thank you. What, the fuck, is this? This is a mistake. - That's a correction. - No. It's a correction, but it's a, fucking, mistake. Where is Anne, I wanna speak with here. I'm sorry, Anne is in a meeting right now. No, get her out of the meeting. It's an emergency, I wanna speak with her. Call her on the phone, please. Thank you. If you promise to keep your voice down. - Yes. - I'm happy to call her. Jesus, fucking, Christ! Hello, Anne. Can you ask how this 155 bullshit happened? Did you hear that? - Okay. - What did she say? I'm afraid that's your appraisal. I know that's what it says, I'm asking who came up with the, fucking, figure. - Oscar in Gems. - Oscar is, fucking, wrong. I can go on and get 6 appraisers right now, 5 of them would say at least three thousand dollars a carat. - He is saying he can go to 6 appraisers... - Give me the phone. Can I speak with her please? Look, I'm sorry, but I have to hand you over. No, that wouldn't be necessarily, I'd rather you didn't. - Anne. - Yes. This is, fucking, outrageous. Okay, you need to calm yourself down, Mr. Ratner. I don't wanna be calm. This appraisal is a, fucking, joke. Oscar happens to be one of our most experienced gemologists. Who, clearly, knows nothing about colored stones. And why, the fuck, am I hearing about it now? Do I need to remind you that you brought the opal to us on a Friday night for an auction set on a Monday morning? - We were lucky to get appraised at all... - I don't give a fuck. I don't care. It needs to be changed. Do it. That's not an option, but... If you like we can pull it. Pull it? No, no. We are not gonna pull it. Here's what you'll do. You gonna make an announcement at the top of the auction. That the correction was wrong. - No, no. - And the original estimate stands. We are not correcting a correction! We can either pull it or carry on as is. - It's entirely up to you. - Okay, thank you so much. - Okay, Anne, I'm sorry too. - You know I have been... - We are done here, I had enough of this. - Yes, that would be perfect, I'll let her know. Let who know? Me and my stuff had to work the entire weekend... Okay, thank you so much Anne and I wanna say from the bottom of my heart, I apologise. - Okay, I'll tell her, thank you. - You understand? I can assure you, this is the last... So, she said that we need to take the inserts out of each catalog before the auction starts, so, you have those. If you want, I saw box down there, and I can start on these. - What is that? What are you doing? - I just have a question for Anne. You don't need to call her. I just spoke with her. Oh, it's a simple question, don't worry about it. Howard. Hi, Anne, he's saying that you told him to... Okay, listen, just, fucking, put them back in, I don't give a shit. - Gooey! - We're here. You're sight for sore eyes. Is he here? KG? He is... I didn't see him yet. Is he there? I got all these things for him to sign. Listen to me, listen. Do you want them? Get that before the auction starts. Go to the auction, see if he's there. - He's a great guy, you'll love him. - He's excited. I wanna ask you a little favor. What, what favor? I need you to jack up the bids. What? No, no. Absolutely not. Gooey, a little bit, just here and there you make a bid. I just gotta make sure we get it up to 250. What if I win at 250? That's easy, I'll give it right back to you. Jesus! This is not a really nice position you put me in, you know? - I reset this. Very much. - You think I wanna do this? I fucked up, I should've got my own appraisal, but I didn't have the time. How much they appraised it for? - 200. - 200? But these assholes, they don't have an opal specialist. My guy at the AGL says 500, just based of the pictures. Listen, 20 % I give you for the winning bidding. You got to be a partner with me. KG is gonna buy it. It's not a problem. This guy is obsessed with the stone. Today was supposed to be about Aaron meeting KG. - Gooey. - To show support. That's what today was supposed to be about. This is support, this is support like you've never known.

So, I'm gonna need a couple of weeks on that. But it will be done. - I promise you. - All right. - Aaron, let's go, come on! - Dad, I got, like, 6 autographs. Now! You got the autographs, that's great. Yeah. Wasn't guy like a champ? - Don't be mad at me, please. - Get in. Please don't be mad. Come on, can I get the opal? Let me get the opal. - What for? - Because I gotta sell that. - Take the fucking opal. - Yes, all right, okay, thanks. Get them going. Open the fucking door. What's he waiting for you for? All right.

No one on the, fucking, phone! - If you just give me two, fucking... - Get, the fuck, out. You're lucky there are people around you, you prick. Come on, get out of here. Let's go. Hey, fucking... Arno. Just listen to me, please. I spoke... I spoke to Demany, remember Demany? He's a business friend of mine. He gave me the, fucking... That's enough, Howard! That's fucking enough! Why are you being so thickheaded? Fuck you man, suck my dick! Throw him in the, fucking, water! Where, the fuck, are my glasses? I know this is a 400 dollar bag. I'll give you 250. - Howard. - Forget about Howard... - Howard, Justin is... - I'm not feeling good. - Are you okay, what wrong with you? - I won't work. - Send everybody home. - All right, sweetie. Hey, sorry to bother you. What is it? I just wanted to see how the auction went. Terrible, I don't wanna talk about it. Okay. Well, Damien and Joseph brought this amazing sweat suit, that I think it would look so nice on you. Do you wanna see it? Just leave me alone, please. Come on, Howard. - Don't look at me. - Oh my God, Howard. - Don't look at me. - What the fuck happened to you? Don't look at me, please. I don't know if I'm gonna make it. I don't know. Everybody is... - It's not ever going right. - I know. I'm so sad. I'm so fucked up. Yeah, I'm really upset too. I'm sorry if this has anything to do with me, but I swear, I really didn't do anything. I wish you were nicer to me though. It was not nice what you did to me. I tried, but it's really hard. I don't know what to do. I don't have any place to go. I don't have anywhere to get. But you do. Like, really, Howard? You're my home, you could come to me. I can't make it out. I can't make it... What I am I supposed to do? Everything I do is not going right. I don't know what to do. I, really, don't know anymore. Shit, I really don't... I gotta figure this out. I really do. I got something, if you want. But you can't make fun of me. What? It's so stupid. I don't know. I got it, I thought it would make you feel better. Look, unzip my skirt. Not like that, just unzip my skirt. It says "Howie". What did you do? Why would you do that? You don't like it? - I do, I'm not worth it. - Yes, you are. - I'm not worth it. - You are worth it. - Look. Howie, I'm so crazy about you. - I don't deserve this. Yes, you do. I love you. - You can't even get buried with me now. - It's okay. Oh, this, fucking, guy! Do not let him in, understand me? Just ignore him. Ignore him, Joey. Here, let's get you cleaned. It's not broken, right? You don't think it's broken, right? This is crazy, you can't be out here, looking like this. Help me answer that. Hello. Hi, this is Liz, I work with Kevin. I'm actually, looking for a Howard. This is Howard. Hi, yes, I got your message from Demany about the gem. We're at the bank right now. - Does he want it? - Yes, Kevin still interested. We can actually... It's like we discussed, right? It's still 175, right? - In cash. - Yes, yes in cash. Like I said, we're at the bank right now. Kevin, yes, I told you. - Howard, I gotta go. - Okay. I'll see you soon, goodbye. See? I told you. Arno. Listen, no bullshit. Kevin Garnett is coming to my office right now, with a 175 thousand dollars cash, all right? You said I got till Monday? Today is still Monday. I don't know if you're hearing this, but, Arno, this is real. Kevin's really on the way, he was just at the bank. Come get your money, buddy. I need the Celtic ring back. - What happened to Friday? - I know, I know. - It's Monday, Howie. - I know what we said. - It was a short week, Pesach... - What happened to your face? Car accident, okay? - So listen to me. - What do you need? I need the Celtic ring. I'm gonna give you the Knicks ring. You know what that means to me, swap them out, please. You've had this Knicks ring forever. I just need the Celtic ring back. - No, No. - What do you wanna do? - I own that ring right now. - I know, I know you do. I'll swap you the 2 rings, but I'm gonna put a 15% vig on this one. And if you're not here by Friday, it's gonna be the same thing all over again. - You're not gonna have a third ring. - You don't have to worry about it. I'll make it 16%, I'm sorry I fucked you up. Howie, what's going on? Are you okay? I'm very good. Everything's going good. I promise you. Hey, there he is! KG, don't you got a game tonight? I got your chip right here. Game night. - We really gotta go. - You must be Liz. Yeah, we gonna make it quick, absolutely. Julia, let's get these guys some Powerades. Powerades? Water? Anything else? It's fine. I'm okay. That's okay. Yeah, I'm good. Howard, let me get a second with you, okay? Kevin, we need to be in Boston, no more than 5 minutes. Give me 2 seconds. Kevin, we gotta be in Boston in less than an hour. What's up with you man? What the fuck is going on? Ever since I met you, you've been giving me the rid around with everything. What do you mean? I feel like, you're, fucking, with my emotions, you're just playing with me at some point. This hasn't been straight since I came here. - You understand? - Why are you saying that? Just one thing, you know, I came back over here, I brought it back. Howard, I brought it back, I didn't have to bring it back, you understand? I showed up at the auction, you had somebody to bid against me. All these, fucking, games, like, what, the fuck, are you doing man? Like, you don't think I noticed? You think I know none of this? It's complicated, KG. You see this face? Do you see it? Here's the 165 thousand right there, cash. I'm showing you, because this wasn't easy. Six percent goes to Demany. I’ve already taken that out. I guess that's fair. Let me get the fucking opal, man. Let me get the fuck out of here. - This opal. - Yeah. - This opal is very valuable for you. - Absolutely. Okay, I did that. I respect you. I respect your passion. - Okay, I always had. - I thought you were a fan too, man. I'm a fucking huge fan. What did you pay for this? Real shit. What did you pay for this right here? That's not a fair question, Kevin. We're talking months and months of, fucking, my time. I'm not gonna take the money back, when I did a deal now. Straight up. Straight up me and you. Mono mono. How much did you pay for this? What did I pay? I paid... This is... I'm telling you, if I answer that question it's very misleading. Why? - I paid a hundred grand. - So you doubled your money. I'm the joker here, all right? I got fucked. A million dollars is what I was supposed to get. I get a, fucking, what? Made 65 Gs? You gave some niggas, from Ethiopia, a hundred grand for something, you thought was worth a million dollars? You don't see nothing wrong with that, Howard? Ethiopian miners, you know what these, fucking, guys make? A hundred grand is fifty lifetimes for these, fucking, guys. A million dollars is more, that's my point, you understand? You wanna win by 1 point or, fucking, 30 points, KG? Right? I see you out there, when the, fucking, stadium's all booing you. You're 30 up, you're still going full tilt? Let’s see what Vegas... What is Vegas got you guys at tonight? Take a look, let's see. Are you serious gonna put this up right here? Look at this shit, the Sixers are supposed to win the game tonight, they think. I don't keep a track of none of this shit. Who give a fuck. They think on game 7 you're not gonna get, fucking, 18 points. They don't think you gonna get 8 rebounds? These guys don't know shit about me. What, the fuck, do they do? Doesn't that make you wanna, fucking, kill them? Doesn't that make you wanna say fuck you for doubting me? Doesn't that make you wanna step on, fucking, Elton Brand's, fucking, neck? Come on, KG, this is no different than that. This is me, all right? I'm not a, fucking, athlete. This is my, fucking, way. This is how I win. All the, fucking, hard work I do. All the, fucking, ass kicking, and the dudes I pay. You're not gonna score on a big one on game 7? Fuck these people, right? That's how you feel, I know you do. So look... Let's, fucking, bet on this. Let's bet on this shit. I'm, fucking, gonna bet all this money on you tonight, KG. You are here to win, KG, these fuckers don't know. Them out, fucking, west. You think they, fucking, know you? They don't know you, they don't know us. It's about, fucking, winning, it's about you. I saw your, fucking, conviction, your, fucking, honesty and your, fucking, magic. Howard, you're, fucking, crazy, man. KG, do you even understand how, fucking, great of a game you gonna have tonight? - I know it. - Listen. We're a team tonight, KG. That is, fucking, lock, it's a, fucking, feeling. We both have it, they don't know. You and I know, all right? Nice, fucking, watch too. Hey, do you mind watching this place, while I run to the bathroom? Thank you. Can I leave you guys alone in here? - Go mind your business, sweetheart. - Do you want company? I don't think so, but next time maybe. Hey, hey! I'm looking for Howard. I don't know where he is. I'm fine. We're closed. He gave me a, fucking, fake Rolex. I have no idea about that, sir. Please, come down. - Val, can you, please, open up? - Let me talk to you about this. - You gotta help me. - I'm sorry I'm leaving. This is gonna be one of the best nights of our, fucking, life. Howard. Come on. Where are you? - Howard, what, the fuck, is going on? - Take this. - What is this? - I need you to listen to me carefully. I booked you on a Blade, okay? You gonna land on top of the Mohegan Sun. There's a bet in that bag. I want you to take all of it. All of it inside the bag and place it on that bet. - How much is in the bag? - It's a lot. I don't want you to think about that, all right? I don't even want you to look at that, until you get there, and you take it out, and give it to the teller, you understand me? Okay, I got it. I'm gonna fuck the living shit out of you tonight, you know that? I wish I could kiss you. - You gotta go. - Okay. - You get going. - All right, love you, bye. Thank you, Jo. Good to see you, Josh. - All right, let's get this over with. - Arno. - You never gonna believe this shit. - Believe what? We are about to hit so, goddamn, big. KG was just here, you saw him, right? I gave him the gem. He's gonna fuck up the money line so bad tonight. Howard, where is the money right now? It's on the way right now. It's on the way to the casino. What, the fuck, are you talking about, Howard? - What, the fuck, is going on right here? - Where is that girl? - The girl that went to the bathroom. - I haven't seen her. - She didn't get back here? - No. - What are you not getting? - No, it's in this room right now. Go get her now, bring her back! - Hey, handsome, hit the buzz. - Open the, fucking, door! Why, what am I opening the door for? - Somebody, fucking, buzz me out. - I got it, I got it. - What are they doing? - Let's go. Let's go! - You're saying what? - Put your hands off me! What, the fuck, are we doing? It's gonna make sense in about 2, fucking, minutes. - Listen to what I'm telling. - I'm listening. You gonna do what I tell you to do. Listen, you, fucking, goon, I'm telling you something... Howard, listen to me! Arno! Get the, fucking, machine, now! Arno! - Shut the fuck up! - What are you doing? Wait, hey, come on, come on! You want to get in touch with her? I'll drop you on your fucking head, you hear me? - Okay, get me up. - You gonna call her? - I'll call. I'll call. Please! - You gonna get that bitch down here now?
