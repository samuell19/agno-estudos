Yael Abecassis Uri Klauzner Hanna Laslo Ronit Elkabetz Lupo Berkowitch Amos Lavie Liron Levo Yosef Carmon Amit Mestechkin Lyn Hsiao Zamir in ALILA Based on the novel by Yehoshua Kenaz Returning Lost Loves Eyali, when you're on leave, come work with me. You'll get experience. So after the army, you'll have a job, you'll earn a living. Right, sonny? Earn a living. What does that mean? Forget it, Dad. I already told you. After the army? I don't even know how I'll get through it. Lady, you're in the middle of the road! Don't worry, son. You'll get through it. You'll do great. We've all been through it. I don't know. I hope you're right. Dad, I love you and Mom. Sweet boy. Don't worry. You'll be okay. You know, for three years I ran around with a five-gallon jerrican on my back. It'll toughen you up. It'll make a man of you, Eyali. I don't know what to say. You think that does you good? Ambushes, lying in the mud? Sleeping outdoors? Why did you want me to join a combat unit? Huh, Dad? Why did you insist? How can I put it? Someday you'll understand. I can't explain, but someday you'll go abroad, and even if you're having fun, it'll feel alien to you. You'll miss this language, these streets, these smells, this whole mess. It's our country, Eyali. I can't explain it. Watch how your father does business. See those Chinese over there? - See them? - Those guys? Yes. You'll see how I operate, how I get their price down. Work? Yes, yes. What work? Building? Masonry? Painting? Yes, yes. - Know how to do? - How much? 100 shekels per day. Cash. - No, no. - Why not? What's going on here? Dad, I have to leave. - What's the problem? - Can I see the permits? What do you mean? What permits? Their work permits. They left them at home. I don't understand what... - No permits, no work. - Eyali! Is there a problem? No, not if they have permits. They have them! They've worked for me before. Come on. Come along. I pay well. 250, okay? 250, is that okay? I'll bring you back here after work. Let's go. Screenplay by Marie-José Sanselme and myself, Amos Gitai Photography by Renato Berta It's not far. Editing by Kobi Netanel and Monica Coleman Sound by Daniel Ollivier, Alex Claude and Gérard Lamps You do everything? Building? Painting? - Soldering? - Yes. I'm Ezra. Casting by Ilan Moskovitch Line producer, Shuki Friedman Costumes by Laura Shein Continuity by Sari Amir Set design by Miguel Markin Production by Laurent Truchot and Michael Tapuach Producer, Michel Propper And the director was me, Amos Gitai Enjoy the movie. See you. We use this. We make building. With trowels. Then, painting. What's up? Yeah. No. She gave me her number. She said we'd talk later, then she split. Of course she came to screw. No. She stood me up. She came by two days later just to give me a hard-on, then she split. Anyway, she calls and says, "What'll we do?" In the disco, I was sure we were going to screw. We kissed, felt each other up, all that. Then I said to her, "Let's play backgammon." Yes. She shows up... First she beats me, then I get even. I promise you. No, later. Then she says yes, no, yes, no... Next she says, "Listen, you're a nice guy. I don't want to put you on. I'm going home." She split. The chick's 20. I go to a disco, the one where they give massages, and I ask the girl, "Can I have one?" She makes me lie down, massages me, then whispers, "Shall we do this at your place?" Then she says she has to leave. In fact, she wasn't even a masseuse. I don't like that. See you tomorrow, period. She saw a girlfriend home. She treated me like shit. Someone's here. Call you later. No, the biggest drag was I lost at backgammon! Know any apartments around here? Got a light? Want one? Can I trust you? Yes. I'm looking for a pad around here. No problem. I can solve that. None of that! No contract, nothing. My word's my bond, okay? How much? - How many rooms? - Just one. One room? A studio. I've got a nice place on Rothschild. Rent that one to Yacov. - Who's he? - My brother. We look alike, right? For sure! I need a place around here. Around here? I've got a place on the parking lot. Small, not bad, in a renovated warehouse. Interested? Sounds fine. I pay cash in advance. Not a word to anyone. Okay? Will you be alone or with... You ask too many questions, pal! - Okay, I didn't say a thing. - It's not your business! Seven, eight... It's not counterfeit, I hope. Do I look like a forger? How dare you! It's cool. For you. Go up the stairs, first building on the right, right again after the corridor. It's the white door. Okay? The key. - Want me to show you? - No need. Have fun. Why don't you answer? - You live here? - No. - But you come often. - I have a friend here. And you do the shopping? - You a cop? - No, just chatting. I'm shopping for a sick friend. I have the key. She's bedridden. - Can I help you? - No, thanks. It's not heavy. Pay your maintenance, lady! Maintenance! What are you gonna do about it? I'll pay you. What's going on in there? Can't you screw silently? Stop it. Shut up. What is this? In the daytime! It's not normal! The whole building can hear! I'm fine. Everything's fine. I'll complain to the building committee! They'll think someone's being tortured to death. Next time I'll scream silently, I promise. Wait 10 minutes before you leave. Got that? These red shoes... Got them with higher heels? I'm sure we do. Gabi! You're late. Try on the boots. You have them? Great! Were you with him? I just don't know how your affair will end. - Help me. - I don't like it. - Scares me. - Everything does. Me, scared? I'm worried for you, dummy. I don't know what's happening to you now. You can't stand anyone. You're here, but your head's somewhere else. - Stop or I'll be sorry I ever told you. - How long can you go on like this? Don't worry. I can keep a secret. I feel like I'm cheating on him now. Like them? They're pretty. Got them with higher heels? Higher than these? Where'll you wear them? In bed. You kill me. I don't get it. You have to hide to see him. You can't even call him. You have to lie, to hide, he can't go out with you. What does it mean? I don't know. I don't know. He's protecting himself. From what? From whom? If you ask me, one of you is gonna flip out. - Think it'll be him? - Yes. So what? Even if he left, Mali, it wouldn't change my life. It's a few hours a week. I don't understand. You love him or not? I don't know him. What? I only see him in bed. Is it that good? Not bad. That's all? Nothing more? Nothing more. So he makes the rules. It's when he wants and how he wants. You enjoy being a whore, a mistress? It excites me, Mali. It's complex, this obsession with secrecy. It's like... two secret agents on enemy soil. I don't know why he's so afraid, but it's like a war. - As if I was fighting... - Against whom? Against him. But what for? So he'll risk everything for me. What do you mean, "everything"? Everything he's afraid to lose. And if you win, you want to live with him? What are you trying to prove? That I'm capable of it. Want my opinion? You're kidding yourself. You're stuck on him. If I were you, I'd run away before it's too late. It's already too late. This is so perverse. You can choose any guy you want. Find one you can relate to normally, not just in bed. And sell out, like you? Right, pick on me now. The truth is hard to hear. You probably hate me now. How can you say that? My Gabi... Pay for me. - Mali? - What? - I have to talk to you. - Now what, Ezra? - Did the army call? - No, they didn't. Even in my worse nightmares, I hadn't imagined this. Don't make a big deal of it. Our son will be judged. He'll go to prison, okay? How did he manage to run away and not get caught? What kind of an army is that? If he contacts us, we have to call the military police. No way, Ezra. - Hi, darling. - What's up? First kiss me, then I'll tell you. You got what I wanted? - I got everything. - Thanks, love. Why's this pest just standing there? Since his first leave, he barricaded himself inside. - Can't you see? He's got problems! - What's the point of repeating it? Our son's going through a crisis, got it? But he'll get over it. He'll come out okay. Trust him. What if he's in danger? Same old disaster scenarios! Don't worry. The army will find him. In a day or two, we'll know. But for now, stop bugging me! Your divorce wrecked everything. Sure, it's all my fault. What about you? It was our divorce! Ours, Ezra! Ezra! Forget it. She's got her period. - Okay. - What's okay? Now where you going? Shopping. Shopping again. Do me a favor, open your eyes. Go find my son Eyali. Why should he do that? It's my job to find him. Guess why! You screw up everything, Ezra. You live in your car like a bum. Even this job on the site... I found it for you, and you're lousy at it. You deliver late. Stop pouting! I wonder how I stood it for so long. I wasted my life with you! Don't glare at me! It doesn't work anymore! - Ilan, go look for the kid, okay? - Okay. Wipe that hangdog look off your face. Go look for your kid. Look for him together! What's up? I was waiting for you. Don't want to go back to the army? I don't know. When are you going back? You're not sick of crawling around like a stray cat? Don't dare tell your parents? Is that it? I don't know. I told them, but they don't understand. You told your dad you didn't want to enlist? If you'd rather not discuss it, we won't. You didn't come here for no reason. Are my questions bothering you? See what's going on around you? I don't give a fuck. Me neither. I take fucking seriously. Would you like to see your parents and then go back to the army? Maybe they'll forget me. The army doesn't forget its soldiers easily. Drink your carrot juice and keep me posted. Chin up. Ezra, she's calling you. Come with me. - Enough! - Go check the roof. Be quiet. It's unbearable. It's siesta time. Time for resting. It's impossible with all this noise. Then go lie down and never get up again! They're all against us. What did we do to them? You're building a house here. Where else would we live? You were just supposed to close the parking lot, no? Okay, we'll close one side and open the other. Let me show you. Come. Why all the noise? Here, come along. All day and all night, give us a break! There. We closed this side, we'll open the other. That's all. What's all this crap? What's the difference? You don't want us? What are we to you? - Arabs? Is it that? - Thieves, I tell you. You stole land that isn't yours. It's an illegal building site. - Not true. - You don't have a permit. It'll be demolished. You'll see. What? Who'll demolish what? Nobody's gonna demolish anything. Hands off, I said. Nobody. They're all with us. The police, city hall, everyone! Know who you're dealing with? If this goes on, I know people who for 50 bucks will remodel your face with acid. That what you want? Get the hell out! You hear what she said? That's our neighbors! Enough! Fuck off! Remember that... you'll repeat it in court. Nothing short of a murder will make the police move their asses. Listen, you look like a decent person, someone with brains. Our daughter wants to study after the army. She deserves to live with people like you, no? He's talking crap. Why crap? I tell you, it's for our daughter. - Forget it. - Why is it crap? They dig holes all over the neighborhood. They buy up basements and turn them into apartments. Just to make money. It's business. - It's for our daughter. - Sure! It's just business! Ezra, can't you see I'm talking? Right, sweetheart, business. We'll build apartments in every hole. Under the earth, on the roofs. And we'll put seven-foot Arabs in them. No girl will be able to live here. Is that that you want? You'll all leave! My treasure. Here she comes again. Go on! - Don't call me "treasure." - Why do you get so mad? - That's how it is. - Why are you so edgy? - Go on, get inside. - Okay, I'm going. Wait. You paid the maintenance? You spoke to Schwartz? I told you not to speak to anyone! - It's impossible. - I told you, no one. Want me to come in through the window? You provoking me? It's none of your business. None of my business? I don't exist... is that it? Just do what I say! - They'll hear. - Still at it, huh? Your wife spotted us, right? Don't talk about that. - Then what should I talk about? - Shit, why talk all the time? True. All I want is your body. I like it when you talk that way. I hope it lasts. It'll last the time it lasts, Gabi. You accepted my conditions. If you don't like it, you can leave. I won't be coming around much for a while. You want to punish me? Do what I tell you, even if you don't understand. I know. You don't love me anymore. That's how it goes. There you go again. You're like a kid. If I didn't love you, I wouldn't come here. And if I was pretending, you'd notice right away. Your body would tell me? Precisely. Caress me some more. Linda? Why's it never clean here? Don't you know how to clean? Then close the shutters. I can't stand all this noise. It reminds me of the camps. Aviram, come look. I want you to come look. Day and night, they work like that. They're probably already doing the toilet and the bathroom. What can we do? These people listen to loud Arab music all night long. They roast sausages under our windows. So what? I want you to come look. I want a witness for the lawsuit. Not now. I'm busy. So it's up to Schwartz again. A sick old man. The shouts, the screams... Then they drag people out of the barracks. The shouts, the screams, day and night... Then they take off their clothes... The shouts, the screams... They push them into the showers... Hello, sir. How are you? Can you talk? Say something. One, two, three, up! Raise your arms if you can. Lie back. You seem in a bad mood. No, I'm not. So? What have you done all this time? I've lived. Just like when I'm with you. You see? Life without Hezi is possible. Of course. But with him it's better. You seem in a very good mood. What have you done all this time? I've thought about you. Sure... Don't you believe me? You think about me now and then, until you get sick of it. What am I to you? Don't be silly. I have lots of plans for us. Don't I have the right to know them? It's hot in here. I want that door to stay closed. Why are you looking at me like that? You surprised me. - I didn't expect to see you. - I can leave if you want. - Did you come to fight? - No. I came to love you. - Then why are you angry? - I don't like you looking at me like that. How am I looking at you? You're undressing me with your eyes. I always see you naked. Why should I undress you? You know very well what I mean. Let's stop this game. You didn't come. - Doesn't matter. - Yes, it does. That dog! It never stops barking. Drives me nuts. It's always been there. Never disturbed you before. No one must see us together. I want that door to stay closed. I have to go. You and your Ilan. Can't he confide in me? Don't I have a right to know? It all has to go through Ilan? Want me to tell you? Don't blame me. Eyali went to see Ilan. Get it? Maybe he's scared to talk to you, Ezra. Sure, he's scared! Maybe you failed at something. - It's my fault, huh? - Why else would he go to see Ilan? See how you drive? Now what is it? Now what? Ezra, what is it? Get out. I don't believe it. Go on, scram. Cut it out. There's no point... Go see your beautician. Scram. - Okay, Ezra. - I'll take care of it. I'll look for him myself. You'll be late! Watch out for your nail polish! Spoiled brat! Go on, get lost! You're wrong, and you know it! He won't talk to me! I'm the spoiled brat! It's all my fault! At his age, I worked! I got a paycheck! I was in the army, and I fed my father! Spoiled brat! Do what you want! Where's the moped? Where's Ilan? Where's your Vespa? Hurry, go see your rabbi! Run! He'll tell you! Did I teach him there were no limits? Did I teach him that anything goes? Go ahead and desert! Don't do your army service! Shirk your responsibilities! Anything goes! - You're crazy! - Anything goes, huh? Did I raise him that way? Why did we give birth to him? For nothing? Anything goes! It's 5:30 p.m., time for the evening news. The legal committee will meet tomorrow in the Knesset to ratify the elections being moved forward to nextJanuary 28. 4.7 million Israelis are due to vote. The Interior Ministry and the Ministry of Finance want to postpone the municipal elections to 2004. Last week the Labor Party decided to pull out of the national unity government. Yesterday, we all heard the leader of the National Union Party who stated that... Hey, lady! What's wrong with you? You won't speak to me? What's with all of you? Are we Arabs, or what? I'd like to invite you in for coffee! Come see my lovely home! Where are you going with that trash bag? I want to show you something! Wait. You look nice. Wait. Listen, my lovely, I'm a sick woman. I have brain cancer, you know? They're gonna operate on my head. Look! Why do you make problems for us? Lady, where are you going? Listen, I have a daughter... What's wrong with you? Just looking at you, I can tell you know nothing about children! You're not even married, huh? You live alone here, like a bitch in heat? What are you, a dyke? You'll never cradle a baby in your arms. Never! What's the old guy's name? I wanna talk to him! I don't know. She doesn't know. Come on, come on out! It's us, your new neighbors! Come out! We want to talk to you. Soon you'll be homeless! I know a woman... for 100 dollars she'll set fire to this place! Old man, come out or you're dead! Gabi? Recognize me? Mali! You have a new lover? How do I look? Let's see. Turn around. You like it? It's terrific, but why did you do it? Last time, I felt pathetic next to you. Did you do that for me? - Ridiculous, huh? - No. Then why are you laughing? It's terrific. I just have to get used to it. You should've done it sooner. - You saying that to please me? - No. Mali, stop it. I always feel guilty with you. - What's going on? - That's him. - Where? - Behind us. Keep talking. If he comes over, we act like we don't know him. What'll we talk about? Shall we move? - No. How's Ezra? - Lousy. - Shall we move? - No. It's okay. He's gone. You're ashamed for me. What's happening to you? You have to stop this. What's going on? It's not like you. I don't know if I'm all right or not. It's an obsession. All I want is him. I want him. All the time. I obey him. He can do what he wants with me. Sometimes he says he loves me, so I stay in there. You're lucky you don't live there. - Why do you say that? - Because it reminds me of a movie. It was called Back Street. A girl falls in love with her boss. He buys her an apartment on a back street where he can visit her. One day he stops coming, and she spends her life waiting for him to come back, alone in the apartment on that dead-end street. - Why bring that up? - I forgot the ending, but not the pain. I never saw that movie. Odd that he was here. What did you think of him? Old. He's not old at all. It's because he's bald. He's your age. - My age? - Yes. Okay, so he is. Come on. Let's leave. This place is awful. I don't like it here. He may come back. Let's go. Come on, Gabi. Come on. You coming? This outfit suits us, no? Fu, get up! You should've woken me up sooner. I told you to wake me up. Come on. You take Chin and Fa and do the plumbing. You, no more plastering, understand? Okay? He continues with the wall. - Who is it? - Zaada family? - Yes, Zaada family. - Open up. - Who is it? - Police. Police? One moment. - What is it? - It's about your son Eyali. - Her son. - He's my son. Can I come in? Wait, Ezra. Let's all go outside. Come on. Let's go outside. - Has something happened to him? - No. Then why are you here? You been in contact with him lately? Are you in his unit? What unit? When were you last in contact with him? Ezra knows that. Okay, thanks. I forget. It was a while ago. Has he tried to contact you or not? He called to say he was fine. You should've told us. You must tell us everything. It all matters, even the smallest detail! If you don't, you're accomplices. Got that? - We hardly spoke to him. - Okay! - Where did he call from? - Why be so hard on them? Sorry, who are you? Come see me later. We have to talk, okay? - Who's he? - A family friend. Does he have a girlfriend, any pals? - No, no one. - No one. Okay. If he calls or you have news, call us. Got that? His life's at stake. Why? He's bumming around, a perfect target for terrorists. Why didn't you look for him sooner? Mr. Zaada, we've never stopped looking for him. But we can't tell you everything. - Right. - Yes. As long as he's in the army, and serving his sentence, he's our responsibility. Take it easy. Right. Have a nice day, Zaada family. Where were you? You're missing a button! Is that what you wanted? For terrorists to grab him? Ezra. I lied. I, who never lie, not even to the tax man. If you had lied, you'd look better. Do me a favor: Park your car somewhere else. Census Bureau. Open up, please. Hi, my name's Shula. I've been looking for you. Can you spare five minutes? I've been coming for two weeks. It's official. You have to reply. Anyone else live here? I'm sorry, but you're very rude. I have to ask you questions for the government. This is incredible. Think I have time for this? She's hiding. Fine. He's not here. At least I know he's not here. I've seen what she looks like, and she's ugly. Why do they avoid me? I have to fill out this census form. Hello. A Palestinian has been killed near Rafah. His squad was approaching an IDF post. According to our local correspondent, the Palestinians reported that Israeli soldiers killed a 20-year-old man and wounded 10 others, two severely. According to the Palestinians, the incident occurred after youths threw stones at the IDF post. I often looked for him here. I don't like him hanging around here. I told him I didn't like him coming here. Is being in the army in Nablus any safer? He's still a child. There are weirdos here. He's my kid. I don't... - Shall we look for him on foot? - AJerusalem area court... has sentenced four people for murder. They came from Silwan, according to our correspondent... We take that little street and turn right. Eyali! Eyali! It's Dad! Want one? Listen, I dropped him off here. - Here? - Yes, right here. You'd leave a kid here? Where should I leave him? His mother's so worried she can't sleep. Don't worry. She sleeps fine. What do we do now? You okay? Listen, he's around here somewhere... It's a big area. You're mean. Mean... I'd like to spend all my time with you. Let go of me. So you're the victim and I'm the executioner? Is that what you think? Answer me. Is that it? There are things you don't know. You think... that I'm afraid of nothing? That nothing hurts me? I know it's not easy for you. But we don't have any choice. You have to be strong. That'll help me achieve our plans. Sorry I spoke to you that way. Who was the woman in the café with you? Then you saw us? Of course I did. And you saw me. She's an old friend. A friendship that lasts, among women? Men like to say things like that about women. That's what I thought. I hope she doesn't know anything. Because women blab? Does she know or not? No. I want to come and live here. Are you joking? That way there'll always be some of you here. What an idea. It's our place. Is it that important to you? Okay, but respect our rules. Don't talk to anybody. Don't invite anybody in. Don't tell anyone where you live. Don't put your name on the door. You agree to that? Yes. How can you agree to it? I can. You should go out, see people, have fun. Stop waiting for Hezi. It's unhealthy. I can still lead a normal life. Sunday, a Filipino woman, Linda, comes to clean. I gave her the key. Don't return until after 5:00 p.m. She'll see your things, she'll understand, but she mustn't see you. Okay? Wake up. What are you doing here? I told you to park somewhere else, to get out of my life. It's enough already. Why are you clinging to me? Find yourself a new life. Why do you stick around? I had an awful nightmare, Mali. Get me some water. If the work is finished, take your Chinese and leave. That's what we agreed, no? I was in a street full of people, and I see a poor guy lying on the sidewalk. He was filthy. I go over to help him, so that people... I lean over him, turn him over and see that it's Eyali. He glares at me. I try to cover him with my coat, but he becomes hard as concrete, and I can't do a thing. I want to take him in my arms and I shout to people, "Help me. He's my son." Nothing. It's as if... They walk on as if they hadn't seen us. And I can't do a thing. What a nightmare. Calm down. Things are okay. Eyali's fine. Maybe he wants to talk to me. Enough, Ezra. Get out of my life. You're a drag. Nothing but gloom and doom. You're a real pain, you know that? You sit parked here with your gloomy ideas. I'm not like that. I'm light. I want to live, to move on, to have fun. I don't want that life. You're a downer, Ezra. Get a life! I want my son and I won't leave this parking lot. Listen, I know you love me. If you leave, I'll miss you. You really love me. The other guy, as you know... He's just passing through. One of these days, he'll move on. I'll miss you if you leave, but I've had it. Shall we have a smoke, like we used to? You know, I loved you. Shall we light up a cigarette? TheJerusalem soccer team fooled Nazareth's defense with an extraordinary goal by Aharon. Then torrential rain fell on the stadium. But in the twelfth minute, Nazareth equalized on a corner by Mallul. Two suicide attacks havejust taken place, the first on the corner of Hagdoud ha Ivri Street, the other on the corner of Newe Shaanan. There are very heavy casualties in this busy neighborhood of foreign workers who gather in the streets on their way to eat. A third explosion has just been announced... Ezra, why are you looking so glum? - Why did we bring his civilian clothes? - We've been over that. That's enough. I have to hide to see him! No need to be ashamed. He's your son. We're back in contact... that's what matters. Eyali, my love, how are you? One moment, Ezra. Hi, my boy. Got the clothes? What for? - Want me to wash your uniform? - No need. What do you mean, no need? And your beret? Don't scold him. We didn't come for that. You wanted to be in a combat unit. What happened? Tell us why you're being court-martialed. Because of a dumb instructor. I hit him. - So you're going to jail? - It was a sergeant. - You going back to the army? - No. - What'll you do? - Don't worry. - Can't you tell us where you live? - No. I want to be alone, to think things over. With whores and drug addicts? That's where you think things over? - You in a hurry? - Yes. You ever think of us? About what you've done to us? You got enough money? - I manage. - How do you eat? - I manage. - You got money? I manage. How do you get money? - Did you give him money? - Me? Not a penny. - What about Ilan? - What about him? You think he has money? He has to report to his base. No, he doesn't like it there! - What'll he do? - He'll manage. - He's strong and he's smart. - Like you. Of course. He's my son. - You could've come home. - Dad's right. - They'd come. - Who? The military police. Are you stupid? They'd come for you? No one's looking for you. If they were, it'd be settled by now. Here, everyone's out for himself. It's not like it used to be. What if they catch you? There are ways to avoid the army. - Like what? - I can act crazy, turn Orthodox or pretend I'm gay. Stop it! - This is your influence. - Sure it is. It's all my fault. Let me talk to him. Fill me in, son. I don't get it. I don't want to be in the army, that's all. Why? Everyone has to do it. I'm not everyone. - Why? - I want to be me. Do you use drugs? - Look at me. - You're imagining things. - I don't even smoke. - Tell me the truth. I don't do drugs. Don't let those scumbags influence you. I taught you to protect yourself. - Promise? - Don't worry, I'm fine. Listen. Your father... is hard on you because he loves you so much. I love you, too. Don't forget that. Whatever happens, you can count on your dad and me, okay? Till this is over, promise to stay in touch. I don't want to die worrying. - Promise? - Yes. Wait, I'll call Dad. Say good-bye to him. Listen, you're 18. You can do what you want. I can't stop you, or force you to be like us. We all lead our own lives. But I want to know what got into you. You wanted to join the commandos with your pals. Don't you care what happens to your country? Fuck the army! What kind of talk is that, kid? Who taught you that? Did I? You don't understand. Fuck this country! I never want to see you again. You're not my son. What's going on? Here. Listen, don't come home. Even if you have to. Our neighbor's a policewoman. If you need anything, call Ilan. Promise? Take good care. Give me a kiss. Bye. There he is! Welcome back! - How are you? - Fine. I hope it rains a lot. I hope it's torrential. Do you know why? Not for the good of the country, or for agriculture, or for the Sea of Galilee. When there's a lot of rain, we have problems here. You know, the underground water. When it rains a lot in winter, the earth soaks it up and spits it out here on the tiles. The apartment turns into a swimming pool. You know the power of water? Dear God, make it rain cats and dogs! Let's have a deluge! I want you, too. But on my terms. Right now, I'm your mistress. Even a mistress has rights. She's not a toy you can throw away and pick up when you want her back. That's not how it works. You must know if you love her or not. If you don't, tell her. Go away! What? You can't call her from abroad, tell her that you love her, and then disappear again. You have time to decide if you really want me. Like it or not, I'm staying till the end of the month. I want to have your child. Yes. Why did you call me? I'm staying till the end of the month. That gives you time to decide. What's this? I'll be damned! My lock's been broken. I can't get into my home. I have to call a locksmith. - What? - I need the phone book. Sorry. Hi. Haïm Sela? Hello, sir. Someone tried to break in. The lock's been broken. Correct. No, I don't have... Yes. Can you come? Yes, right away. So what do we do? What? What did you say? Okay. Thanks a lot. He can't come. He says there were two of them. They broke the lock and emptied the whole apartment. Now the Mafia has moved in. We're no longer safe. And the police do nothing to protect us. How did he know there were two of them? - There you are. - Thanks. Are you insured? I don't think anything's missing. Doesn't look like it. Maybe they planned to burglarize your neighbors and made a mistake. It happens. You should still go to the police. I'm sick of the police. - I want to be left alone. - For your peace of mind. I have to leave. One moment. Don't bother. Thank you, sir. I thank you. Close the door. Ezra Zaada. Come here, please. I D card number? - 057... - Yes. ...87. - Yes. 1964. Status? Divorced, one child. Know what you're accused of? No idea. Illegal employment of foreign workers. Within 48 hours to one week, all those Chinese will be expelled. Why? They need me and I need them. They're not Israelis. They're not allowed to work. What's going on here? - I want to see someone higher up. - You mean an inspector? - He wants to see the inspector. - I'll take care of it. Go back and take a seat. What are they here for? Just a burglary. Gentlemen, go see the detective. - Over there. That's her, standing up. - I'll go over it. I called you. You saw my broken lock. You broke the door to let me in. That's it. Hi. Oh! Look at him! I didn't recognize you. - Yes? - You work here? Yes, sweetie, do you mind? Here to complain about us? - Baruch! - Coming! Come here a second. This guy lives alone with his dog. We know what that means, huh? Here, we're informed about everything. What's your problem? I'm a locksmith. He called me, I broke the door open... And what I did see? Sodom and Gomorrah! The carpets... Okay, I got it. Spare me the details. You take care of them. Go have a seat, gentlemen. - But we want... - Come see me later. We're neighbors. We'll have coffee. - Go on. - Neighbors. Think of it. A guy who lives alone with a dog. God help us! Go see them. I don't understand what's happening. Wait till the inspector is free. We've been here all morning. They're hungry. You understand Hebrew, or do we have to speak Chinese? We'll call you as soon as she's free. Don't you watch the news? The government decided to expel foreign workers. Chinese, Thai, Japanese... all out. - Good job. - Hire Israelis. Ezra, my bunny, why are you here? Got a problem? He's my builder. His son deserted. Any news, love? Did he contact you? No. Your son's become a criminal. Poor guy. So what's the problem now? Who are all these Chinks with you? We're being hassled. Hassled? You'll be freed. We'll work it out. And the Chinese? Aren't there lots of others just like them at the bus terminal? Just forget them. They send money to their families. Sure, they have families. That old song. I want a bargain price. Huh? A real bargain. Release them all. What else have we got here? Baruch, come here, love. Why are you giving me two? Pain in the ass. What a nothing day. Make me a strong coffee. With sugar? - No sugar. You know that! - Okay. A guy who lives alone with a dog. God help us! You got it? Now I've seen everything. A nutcase. God help us. A guy living alone with his dog. Where you going? I asked where you're going. Gabi, wait. Where you going, damn it? - Why did you come? - To see you. You came to kick me out. We said you'd stay here till the end of the month. Don't worry. You won't see me again. Why? I really want to. I've lost interest. It was just physical between us, and I'm over it. You don't interest me anymore. You want to punish me? Is that it? Let go of me! Want me to hit you? I won't give you that pleasure. You think I'm a bimbo? No, a bimbo's a bigger turn-on! Right. So you'll move a bimbo in there? Can't steal any more from the company to pay the rent? Shut up. Don't worry. I won't say a thing to anyone. Even about your bank accounts. I won't play the bitter mistress. Go! Go! I'm not holding you back. No, I'm not in a hurry today. At the office they told me to watch out, because you're a bastard. That what you think of me? Aren't you ashamed? You worry about what people think? You really hate me, huh? Not even that. I got bogged down in an affair with a guy I didn't love, with whom I had nothing in common. You never enjoyed it? - It was more pain than pleasure. - Say that again. I didn't hear you. It was more pain than pleasure. What's wrong? Get back to work. You'll miss me, Gabi. You'll see. You'll miss me. Know what I loved about you? What? The smell of your body. What more do you want? That's not enough? Let go! For a bimbo, maybe. But not for me. Aviram, come see. Three feet already, and it's still rising. It rains too hard. Doesn't a man of my age deserve some joy? As long as I'm still around when they see it. I hope I live that long. - Come here. - Hold this. Ezra! What's happening to us? Why is God punishing us? What did we do wrong? Why don't they want us here? Who are we bothering? Why don't they want us? It's no use. We won't give in. They won't get their way. We won't give in. They don't know who they're dealing with. That old creep cursed us. May he croak! To hell with him! We, too, know a woman who can cast evil spells. For a few dollars, she'll do a good job here. We won't let our daughter live here. No way! Not in my life. Never. We'll buy her a plush condo in Ramat-Aviv, near the university. She'll never live with people who love Arabs and hateJews. No problem! We'll give them Arabs! Know what we'll give them? Drug addicts, the scum of the earth. You cheated us! You cheated us, too. We'll give them such a bad time, they'll want to go back to Poland. We'll sue you! You'll all pay for it. We're no babes in the woods. I've got a lawyer. I'm afraid of no one. You, too. We'll make you pay, too. We'll make you all pay. You don't scare me. I've got a lawyer. I'll sue you, too! And him, and all of you! We weren't born yesterday. Not yesterday, not the day before. We'll sue you all! Anyone in? I have no more light, Ezra. Come here, Ezra. The power's gone out. Can you help me? Go round the back. Here's the fuse box. It's too old. The fuses are blown. So? I'll go get my tools. Chin! Fang! Fa! Bring me the pliers and wire. The thin wire. Hurry, Fang. Let's see. - Is that okay? - Fine. Very good. Maybe this one'll work. I'll try, okay? Let's see. Yes, that's fine. You see? Maybe this wire'll do. One of them always blows because it's too old. Let's see if we're in luck. Ching, try that. Pull the switch. Fu, give me some light. Wait a moment. I can't see a thing. Yes, that's perfect. Wait. Can you see anything? - Where? - Here. Wait. That one's blown, too. Good. Thanks a lot. You see the problem? See those two things? They have to be connected by a wire, but since it's old, it burned up. The fuse burned. So did the other one, you see? They're worn out. I'll change them for you and get it working again. - Thanks, Ezra. - You're welcome. Like some coffee? Sure I would. I'll take this up and come back. Tonight we won the elections! The people said no to what's going on! They want... a different Israel! I'm asking you to stop. Thank you. I don't wanna play "he who shouts loudest is the winner. " Gentlemen, we are gratified tonight and have a right to be delighted. But our mission is difficult and our responsibility immense, and we must seize this opportunity, this extraordinary, historic opportunity that the people have given us. We conducted a fair election without zigzagging... You okay, Eyali? Take good care. Don't get pushed around. Will you write me? Will you write us? Do they let you write? Tell us what's happening. Ilan has connections. Thanks for everything. I love you. Sure you want to go? You know, the army, the country today... it's not what it used to be. Today it's... I don't care anymore, you understand? Sorry for everything, Dad. I apologize. Eyali. Come on. Let's get out of here. Let's get out of here. Get in. Get in. Hurry, son.
