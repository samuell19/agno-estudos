You want to announce yourself When you come up behind somebody. Didn't know there was anybody in here. You see my tracks? Wasn't looking for any. Just came to water my horse. Go ahead. I know most of the people around here, And they're friendly. So am I. But I don't like surprises. You might have shot me for doing nothing at all. Sorry. Wouldn't have done you much good to be sorry If you'd plugged me. How old are you? 20. Well, let's put it this way. You stand a whole lot better chance Of being able to vote someday Now that you've learned not to sneak up on people. I can take care of myself. I don't need no lessons from you or anybody else. All right. All right what? You're not sore because I pointed a gun at you. You're sore because you got scared. Anybody who don't get scared Looking down the wrong end of a gun barrel ain't very bright. But if you wanna feel like Billy the Kid And get tough about it, go ahead. That is, unless you happen to be Billy the Kid. In which case, I withdraw my offer. No, I ain't Billy the Kid. I didn't think you were. We wouldn't be standing here talking. My name's Dow. Matthew Dow. Davey Bishop. Glad to know you, Davey. I guess I was acting like a kid at that. Don't know when you got a better right. 20, huh? Yes, sir. Where you headed? Madison, just over the pass. We can ride together. You going there? Going that way. Not much doing there. Good. You know somebody in Madison? No. Can't figure why'd anybody Wanna go to a dead place like that Unless they had to. You have to? I live there. What do you do for a living? Most anything that comes up. Odd jobs, mostly. Look like you'd make a good ranch hand. $20 a month and keep? No, thanks. Been around much? Some. That's for me. I'm gonna light outta here pretty soon. See what's going on in the rest of the world. Lookin' for excitement, huh? Sure, why not? No reason. Felt the same way myself when I was your age. Just about makes it every time. Got held up last month. Right along here when she was barely moving. Lost all the payroll money. Thought you said nothing ever happened around here. That sure lit the fuse. Had posses out all over the place. Never did find 'em. You ask me, the sheriff wasn't too anxious to. Talk was, it might have been the Gentry gang. There's two fellas up ahead, right at that same spot. We can handle two of 'em. If they're holdup men, they won't be alone. There'll be plenty of others hiding around the brush Where they can throw down on us. I only see two. That hawk's been following me all day. In case you thought I didn't draw on you 'Cause I couldn't handle a gun... That's the signal. That's what they did the last time. Sometimes it don't matter so much how fast you are. It's where you put the first bullet that counts. Put that gun down, or they'll kill us. I got a wife and family. I don't wanna get killed for somebody else's money, No matter how much it is. Holy smokes. How do you like that? They thought we were bandits. How far is it to town? 'Bout ten miles. We'd better get there quick. Awful lotta money to have dumped into your lap. Man wouldn't have to work the rest of his life. Here. Let's get going. You carry it. I'll follow you. What's the matter? Don't you trust me? Like you said, that's an awful lot of money. Since you brought it up, how do I know You won't plug me in the back and make off with it yourself? One of us has to take that chance. What are you trying... Where's the sheriff? Over in his office, I guess. Why? We got held up. Hey, Scottie! The whole gang woulda jumped us. There wasn't anything else we could do. Round up some horses. What happened? Somebody held up the train again. Anybody hurt? No, we didn't give 'em a chance this time. Soon as we seen they had us, we... well, we threw out the money And told Sam to pour on the coal. How many of them was there? We couldn't tell for sure. When the first two fired on us, I knocked Larry back out of the way. Did you get a good look at 'em? One of 'em was riding a pinto. I didn't stare too hard. Last time, they give me this Just for being a little slow getting my hands up. Let's grab a rifle, boys! We gonna ride around in circles again, Like we did last time? No, we ain't. They had a bigger start before. This time's gonna be different. Better be. There they are, boys. Where's the rest of 'em? Maybe they split up. Why would they be riding toward town? I don't know what tricks they're up to, But one of 'em's riding on a pinto. Looks like that one in front's Got a money bag tied to his saddle. Yes, sir. That's them, all right. Pass the word. Don't fire until I give the signal. I don't wanna scare 'em off before they get into range. Ain't you gonna give 'em a chance to give up? They're gonna get the same chance The train crew got last time. Hey, son! Son! This one's still alive. Grab him, boys! Here's his gun. Drag him up. I told you we'd get 'em this time. Wait, you got us wrong. Here's the money! We were bringing it to town. The messenger threw it off the train. He threw it off, all right. After you took a shot at him. Why would we be bringing the money into town If we were holdup men? You probably got a hideout around here, that's why. Get him up to that tree! Come on! What kind of a sheriff are you? Hanging a man without a trial? We got you and the money. That's good enough for me. Come on! Wait a minute! The other one is Davey Bishop. Davey Bishop? Aye. Is he dead? No, he's still breathing, but that's about all. He's in pretty bad shape. Well, uh... well... Take him over to Swenson's place. We'll send a doc out from town. Aye. I'll ride ahead and get him. All right, come on! Get him into town! All right, boys. Now get ahold of them baggage men. They're waitin' inside. Good. Now we'll find out whose story holds water. I'm just as anxious as you are. That's him. That's one of 'em. What did you tell these people? Let me hear what you said to them. Well, I told them what happened. All right, let's hear it again. Just exactly what did happen? Go on. Like I said, we were right near the top of the grade, Where we got held up before, and we heard these shots. Two shots. Did they come at you? We figured that was a signal. What made you figure that? Last time... Never mind about last time. Did we make any move at you? I wasn't taking no chances. Tell the truth! Did we or didn't we? Maybe... Maybe we did act a little hasty. You sure did. Then you made up a great big story about it. And then these butchers did the rest. Now, just a minute, mister. Where'd they take the kid? Swenson's farm. Couple miles south of town. You ain't told us what you was doin' here to begin with. I was comin' in to look your town over To see if it was the kinda place I'd wanna live in. Well, you sure answered that question. Here's your gun. It'd be a good idea if you wore yours that way. Mister, we... We owe you an apology. I'll tell the boy. He'll be real touched. Well, how was I to know from what these two fellas... We didn't ask you to shoot nobody down Without giving 'em a chance. You'd think I done it all by myself. You was there, too. All of you. You were wearin' the badge. Yes? Ma'am. I'm looking for Davey Bishop. They said they were gonna bring him here. This is the Swenson place, isn't it? It is. I... I was with him when the law jumped him. The sheriff just admitted he made a mistake. The boy's here, isn't he? Yeah. The doctor's just with him. One moment, please. Your name Swenson? Ja. Helga Swenson. You will come in? Thank you. How is he? You hurt, too? Oh, it's nothing. A crease. What? A crease. Just the skin. What about Davey? He's in here. That's all I can do for him. How is he? Three bullet holes and a leg all busted up. Is he gonna make it? I can't work miracles. If he's still alive tomorrow, I'll take a look at him. What about his family? They been told? His parents died years back. He's been a ward of the town since, you might say, Living with one family or the other. Too bad. He was a nice kid. Kinda wild, but he'd got over it. You talk like he was dead already. Mister, I can't work miracles. I know. You said that. Bye. Father... This is my father, mister... Oh, Dow. Matthew Dow. I'm pleased to know you. Say, do you mind if I hang around here awhile, Kinda look after him? You're welcome to. Thanks. There's work to do. Farms do not run themselves. In a minute, father. In the old country, Children do not say "In a minute" When the father speaks. That's why I like America. Sit down. I'll fix your head. That's all right. Yes, I know. It's just a crease? Never mind with any of that. Just a little water will do. You sit here. How did this happen, That they shoot at you and the other? 'Cause you got a sheriff in this town Who ought to be behind a butcher's counter. I don't understand if you've done nothing wrong. He didn't wait to find out. They just blasted away. You lucky they didn't hurt you more badly, too. I'd made the boy ride up in front. And, eh, you feel sort of responsible? That's part of it. Thank you. Perhaps there's more? Yes, there's more. My boy had lived to be just about his age. This doesn't look good. Kid's gonna die, he should be able to wake up And see a friendly face. Have somebody around when he wakes up scared. If you need anything, I'm in here. Thanks. Here's your breakfast. He's burning up. Where's that doctor? He said he'd be here today. It's only 7:00. Listen, you eat your breakfast before it gets cold. I'll do this. You've been very nice. And thanks for this, too. You eat now. The doc says Davey's coming along fine. He'll make it. We're getting up a kitty to pay the doc. The boys was wonderin' if there was anything else they could do. Have they got any books in town? Books? I guess I could round some up. But I never figured Davey for much of a reader. Well, maybe he never had so much time before. Aye. I'll see what I can do. He ate everything. Anybody who doesn't like your cooking Doesn't want to get well. He's all right. He went right back to sleep. Well, then I'll... I'll finish this. You said the other night that you had a son. Died ten years ago. Do you have a wife, too? She divorced me. She must have been bad. No. Just hated the sight of me. That's hard to understand. She did very well with it. Does it hurt you to talk about it? Not anymore. You mind if I ask you something? This is as far as our ticket would take us. Well, you were going to ask that. Weren't you? What two Swedes are doing in a place like this? That's right. We didn't know we were coming here. My father has an uncle who lives in California, And he used to write us about his place. So we decided that's where we wanted to go, But we didn't know the country was so big. So when we got this far on the train, We had no more money. So here we are. My father says that when we make enough money, We shall go to California and buy land next to my uncle. Only it's two years now, and we still haven't made any money. How's that? Well, without help, we cannot farm enough to make money. And without money, we cannot hire anyone to help. Isn't there something I can do around here To kinda work off what I owe you for all this? You owe us nothing. Sure I do. I haven't got any money... You are a guest. Father would think you had very bad manners If he heard you talk like that. It is late. Yes, father. He doesn't think very much of me. It isn't you. It's our custom he's thinking of. What's the custom? In Sweden, a girl is not supposed to be alone with a man Unless he's... Well, unless they're... It's a very silly custom, anyhow. Good night. Good night. Soon the boy will be well enough to be moved. He's still very weak, father. He's young. He will get stronger. Morning. Good morning. He's sleeping like a baby. I wanna ask a favor, Mr. Swenson. Ja? You've been very kind to Davey and me, And now that he won't be needing somebody To watch over him every minute, I was wondering if there isn't something I can do around here To kinda pass the time away. A man gets logy sitting around all day. You're right. It's not good for a man to stay in the house. A fella needs exercise. Without it, the man has no appetite. Besides, Helga and you, I would not let you do it any other way. I sure fooled him. Whoa! How 'bout it, doc? When you gonna let me up? Pretty soon now. I feel great. What more do you want? Enjoy it while you can, son. Couple of days behind a plow, And you'll wish you were back in a nice, soft bed. When I get outta here, It won't be to end up behind a plow. Best way in the world to build up your strength. Great for the legs. May I see you a minute? Well, how you doing with the new batch? Take a look. What do they think I am? "A Romance of Flowers... How to Grow Them in Your Garden." "A Young Girl's Dilemma... Should She Marry for Money, Or Listen to the Dictates of Her Heart?" I forgot to tell you, these were sent over With the compliments of the ladies' sewing circle. You'll probably get "Five Little Peppers and How They Grew in the Morning." Matt... What's the matter? I just told her that, That leg isn't going to be any good to him. You mean it's going to take a little while. It'll never be right. How bad is it? Might be able to get around some after he gets stronger... Get around some? He's a kid, not an old man. What kind of a doctor are you? Can't even fix a broken leg. Not the way that one was broken. Why didn't you say so before? Why'd you lead him to believe he was gonna get well? I wasn't sure till I took the splints off. What makes you so sure now? You were wrong once before. Not this time. It's a miracle he lived at all. Miracles don't come in pairs. What does he know about it? He's been ready to call in the buzzards Ever since he got here. Think nobody ever had a broken leg before. Matt! My leg! I can't walk! Oh, you poor boy. Get up. I can't. Get up! Matt, leave him alone. Get out. Matt, you can't force him. Matt! Why didn't you let me die? I'd rather be dead. You're not dead. So get up. Grab hold of that. Pull yourself up. Leave me alone. I'll leave you alone, when you're on your feet. Get up! You heard me, get up! There's nothing wrong with your arms. Pull! That's the last time I wanna see you crawl. What am I supposed to do, Carry a chair around with me the rest of my life? Lots of fellas live and die without ever having to find out How much of a man they are. You could be as good a man as anybody in town. If you are, you'll know it and take pride in it. And they'll know it, too. You all through? Then you get out. Get away from me. You and your big talk. Get outta here on your two good legs! Get out! You better go help him. I heard what he said to you. He didn't mean it. You were right, and he was right. I shouldn't have bullied him. You were only trying to help. I was a big help. Matt! Quick! Watch. How was that? Fine, son. Just fine. Let's see you try by yourself today. Come on, cowboy. How does it feel? Don't ache as much. Ever hear of a cowhand walking when he could ride? If you've got a horse and a saddle, you'll get around. Glad to see you up and around, Davey. We all know how you both feel about what happened. That's why we're here. Yes, we realize this town owes you a debt, Dave, And as mayor, the folks want me to do what we can to pay it off. Now, we're not rich people, Dave, you know that. If we were, we'd make a settlement on you. We've talked it over and decided The next best thing to do is to give you The security of a good job with good pay As long as you want it. I'm not asking for any job. I'm not asking for any more handouts. You shot me up good, but you didn't kill me. So from now on, I think I'll take care of myself. We were just trying to make it up to ya, Davey. Give me back one good leg, and we'll call it square. That's the only settlement I want from any of you. Maybe you can talk to him. We know how the kid feels. He's not a kid. He's a man. We've got something to say to you, too, If you'd hear us out. Yes, we figure this town could do with a new sheriff. It'll pay $1,000 a year and all fines. That's a little high for a slight scalp wound, isn't it? This isn't charity. We need a sheriff. Why me? You don't know anything about me. You were the only one that kept his head that day. And we know what you've been doing for Davey, too. We've had enough gunslingers wearing badges. We figured it's about time we had a man With some character in the job. I'll take it on one condition. That I run the job and name my own deputies. I approve. And you can put lynching down as part of your past history And turn all of your nervous posse-men out to pasture. Congratulations, sheriff. Here's your badge. And a little advance on your salary. We've got a room for you in town, too. I'll be in tonight. So you're the new sheriff. Yep. What's that for? A decent burial. Where I come from, all the peace officers Carry around their own burial money. Custom of the country. Suppose you need that chamber? I'm not that fast. If I haven't hit what I'm aiming at By the time I squeeze off the first five, I'll be needing a pine box instead of another bullet. What did you take the job for if you're not fast enough? 'Cause you'll be my deputy. Remember the time you drew on that hawk Down by the railroad tracks? Yeah. You hit it. Oh, well, I can generally hit what I'm shooting at. But I'm not likely to get in the first shot. You beat me by, oh, I would say, A full three seconds. Yeah, but you said... Look, the way I figure it is this. It doesn't matter how slow I am. You'll be with me. Do you really think... Oh, you don't think I'd be fool enough To take this job alone, do you? In fact, I am pretty fast. I used to practice a lot. Well, start practicing some more, 'Cause we're in business. Take care of the horse, deputy. I heard you and the men outside. Too bad this had to come up, Just when I was getting the hang of being a dirt farmer. Perhaps you didn't like it. I didn't think I would. At first I was doing it just to pay my keep. Then I got kind of interested in it. Working the land and getting something useful out of it. Most peace I've had in a long time. If you feel that way about it, why... Too good an offer to pass up. Besides, I couldn't go on living here. Not with Davey up and around. What's going to become of him? He's going to be my deputy. So that's why you're doing it. $1,000 a year and fines? That's reason enough. And Davey? He's fast with a gun. I can use him. You're a very bad liar. You're kinda tough to lie to. Let's keep it in the family, huh? Don't live his life for him, Matt. Not even if he were your own son. I'm not trying to. All I wanna do is give him a chance. Make him feel like he's doing a man's job. You think putting a gun in his hand Will cure what is in his heart? What do you mean? The way he talked to them when they came out here. I was watching him. It wasn't just the anger of the words. There was a look in his eyes. It frightened me. I've never seen a man look like that before. I have. Did he get over it? Took him a long time. There was nobody around to help him. Maybe it's better that way, to do it on your own. Davey's too young. I can't cut him loose. He'd never make it. He's gotta get over it, or it's gonna get worse. It's gonna go one way or the other. That's where old Dr. Dow comes in. Give him something to do Before he gets feeling sorry for himself. Make him feel he's still a man. That's what he needs. You're awfully sure, aren't you? I'll tell father you're leaving. Oh, I, uh... I wanted to say good-bye to you first. Now, is there anything in the Swedish rules That says I can't see you in town? We go in only on Sundays to go to church. That's what this town needs, a church-going sheriff. Speaking of customs, we have one here in America. When a man and woman like each other, And they're not gonna see each other for a while... Except in church, or with a lot of people around, they... We have that custom in Sweden, too. I should have taken one of those store jobs For all the action there is around here. Good afternoon, Matt, Dave. Mr. Mayor. Two drunks and one fight in all this time. Well... The quieter it is, the better I like it. I don't see where you need me To help you handle stuff like that. Sometimes a deputy doesn't earn his pay For months on end. Comes trouble... You get caught up quick and fast. About the length of time it takes somebody To empty a gun at you. Howdy. How 'bout change for these, Blazer? Yes, sir. How do you want it? Fives and tens will do. Sure enough, mister. Pretty good, huh? That reminds me. Something I been meaning to tell you. Remember when they threw that money off the train at us? Most money I've seen before or since. Me, too. Matter of fact, for a minute there, When you were picking it up, I came awful close to wanting it all for myself. Darn near drew on you. Yeah? Why didn't you? Just about then you tossed the money up at me. That kinda broke it up. Pretty lucky throw, wasn't it? Yeah. Why you grinnin' like that? Did you know all the time? Yes, sir. Mighty good job. The quieter it is, the better I like it. Pete! Come here, son. For you. Think you can handle it? Yeah. I'll have to get some more cash. What's wrong with that? There isn't enough. Just give me what you have. I'm in a hurry. Take care of him. Somebody get the doctor. All right. Get up. Get up. We didn't steal nothin'. We just come in to change some bills. A fella pulled a gun on us. Man's got a right to defend himself. We'll find out about that when we get back in town. Well, you draw pretty good. Too bad nobody's gonna see it. Something else in there, friend. $500 that says you lost my trail. Another hour, I'd have made it anyway. Nobody'll know the difference. Nobody but me. That's a lotta money to turn down, friend. Turn around. Get mounted. Will Andrews and me be safe in your town? You'll go to trial. What are they celebratin'? I don't know. Andrews! This your idea of a trial? What's gonna happen to me? You'll get a trial, just like I said. I tried, Matt. Honest I did. I'm sure you did. Let me see your gun. I had it out. I told them I'd shoot the first man That came through the door. They were drunk. They didn't pay any attention to me. Just kept coming and I was backing up, When all of a sudden... My leg gave out on me. There was nothing I could do. You still had this. I couldn't just shoot into a crowd. Crowds don't lynch people. That was a mob. You oughtta know the difference. Yeah, but this man was an outlaw. Wasn't your job to judge him. We have courts and juries for that. What did you want me to do, be a hero? Shoot somebody? Maybe get shot myself? That was the job, son. I don't want it, then. I don't want any part of it. What about me? What happens when that crazy bunch of drunks Finds out I'm here? You won't be here. By the time they get tired of telling each other How brave they are, You'll be halfway to the county seat. I'll turn you over to the marshal there. Keep an eye on him. I'll get some grub together. How come they let a kid like you be deputy? Takes a man to hold off a mob. Shut up! Don't take it out on me, just 'cause you lost your nerve. I wasn't afraid of 'em. He thinks you were. He thinks a lot of things. My partner out there. He get it quick? I seen a fellow dangle once for 20 minutes. Flopped around like a fish out of water. I didn't watch. I don't blame you. Ain't a pretty sight. No matter how they do it. You. We better get going. Sorry I let you down before. Another chance? Sure you want it? He's your prisoner. Get him there. Thanks, Matt. Don't thank me. Get him there. Guess we showed 'em how to treat outlaws around here. I believe in law and order. But there's times you gotta make exceptions. Outlaws. They're all alike. They're big and tough Until you slip a knot around their neck. You're all under arrest. Look, sheriff, I know you take your job serious, But you're not gonna put me in no jail. That's to cut him down with. Pick it up. Put your guns on the table. We didn't hire you to pull stuff like this. Tell it to the mayor. I... I wasn't in on it. Close up. Yes, sir. I hereby sentence you to be fined The sum of $5.00 each for malicious mischief And another five for disturbing the peace. Court's adjourned. No hard feelings, Matt. Morning. Sorry I gave you trouble last night. Next time I talk up to you, just bust me over the head. I'll keep that in mind. Yeah, here you are, sheriff. Pretty fair day's work. That the established price for lynching? There ain't no established price. No one's ever got arrested for a thing like that before. You think I let him off pretty easy, don't ya? Well, I wouldn't exactly say you made an example of him. Law and order's an awful lot like hard liquor. Too big a dose the first time Is liable to put a man off of it for life. He gotta get used to it, gradual. Maybe that isn't what it says in Blackstone, But he didn't live out west. Maybe you got a point. This still belongs to you. You can do an awful lot with $70. You do it. Where's the sheriff? Judge is giving him a lecture. He's sure getting an earful! Get over to Doc Ridgeway's. They just brought Davey in. What happened to him? I don't know. Somebody found him on the trail, a couple of miles out. Hurt bad? Leg again. Gives me a perfect record. You handed two men over to me, And I couldn't hold either of them. How'd it happen? We were crossing a stream. Gotten off to fill my canteen, and he asked for a drink. When I gave it to him, He brought he handcuffs down on my head. I saw it coming, but I couldn't get out of the way. You shouldn't have let me do it. Just trying to show you I wasn't yellow. I never thought you were. That whole job is a phony. I'm no deputy and never was. Good for wrapping packages behind a counter, And that's all. We'll talk about that later. Nothing to talk about. I'm through trying to fool myself. Can't let you go on doing it, either. If that job's still open, I'm gonna take it. I've given him some pills. If you two will quit gabbing, he oughta get some rest. He's right. Get some rest. Wearing a star ain't all it's cracked up to be, anyway. Oh, yes. Papa is just fine. Here he comes. Dave isn't with him? It'll take the doc time to do the stitching. Matt, how is he? He'll be all right. Just a little knock on the head. The other one got away? Yeah. I told you we shoulda hung 'em both. Old Doctor Dow, sees all, knows all. I certainly fixed things up fine. It wasn't your fault. Nobody else's. I thought it was like the first time You get thrown from a bronc. You gotta get right up on his back again Or the chances are, you never will. Didn't work out that way. You were right all along. You can't live somebody's life for them. Maybe you feel free now to... Well, to start living your own life now. Maybe it's about time I did. As a matter of fact, I've been thinking This'd be a pretty good town to live in for a long time. Why... I thought you were staying only because of Davey. I was at first. And then I got to figuring that with $1,000 a year and fines A man could do all right for himself. Well, I-I'd better be going now. I have some shopping to do. I know I shouldn't even be thinking this. And this is certainly not the time or the place To talk about it. There should be moonlight, And I should be able to say it a lot better... I'd like very much to marry you. I'm not very good at... Well, if that's what you were going to ask me. That's what I was gonna ask you. You better speak to my father. He's very old-fashioned about those things. Bring him on. Be patient with him. He's not used to the ways of this country. We'll get along. What is the matter with you? There's only one move to make. Oh, excuse me. Nay, that is not it. Oh, excuse me. Come in, Matthew. Mr. Swenson. Hello, Matt. It is good you are here. Sit down. Papa, Matthew didn't come here to play chess. Matthew can talk for himself. Well, I... This is fine. Fine. Mr. Swenson... It is my move. It is more rude to correct one's elders. It is your move. Uhh. Well, I should go in the kitchen and make some coffee. Hmm. Oh! Ja da. Checkmate. Well, you're just too good for me. You're a smart man. You know better than to win before I give my consent. Helga told you? Ever since you leave, she go round like lost heifer. Then you come here, all dressed up. What is there to tell? Well, how do you feel about it? You will be good to her. She will be happy with you. Besides, you two had decided anyway. When is it to be? I've had my eye on a place I'd like to buy into. Nice house, plenty of land. Only trouble is, they're kinda short-handed. I figured I might save enough to swing it In the next couple of months. That so? Where is this place? Right here. That can be arranged. Helga! It is late. Say good night to your man. Night, pa. Good night. I will be a very good wife, I promise. Whatever unhappiness you've had before, I will make it up to you. You don't have to make up for anything. Just be you, that's all I'll ever ask. Happy Easter, you two. Hmm, mighty pretty Easter, too. The Martins brought me in. My father had to mend the harness. He'll be along soon. He said not to wait. Davey, I haven't seen you in a long time. Workin' man. Walsh is keeping him busy at the store. That's good. # Christ our lord Is risen today # # Alleluia # # Sons of men And angels sing # # Alleluia # # Lives again Our glorious king # # Alleluia # # Where, O death, Is now thy sting? # # Alleluia # # Dying once He all doth save # # Alleluia # # Where thy victory, O grave? # # Ah... ## Now, everybody sit down nice like, And nobody'll get hurt. How dare you profane a house of worship? Bringing in guns. Begging your pardon, parson. We'll be out of here in a few minutes. What do you want with us? Who runs the bank? I do. Some of my friends are over there now. They figure there's about $80,000 in that vault. That right? You got a nice little family there, banker. I asked you a question. Eight... Eighty-five thousand in gold and in notes. Notes negotiable? Anywhere. That's good. Now where's your sheriff? I got some suggestions for him. Matt Dow. Hello, Gentry. I didn't know you was in these parts. Woulda cut you in, for old time's sake. I wouldn't have taken it. You mean you're really the sheriff? Mm-hmm. And in church. Heh heh heh. This yours? Yes. Yeah. Now, listen, it's gonna take some powder To blow that vault. We're gonna need about five minutes After you hear the explosion. I don't want nobody making any sudden moves. Know what I mean? No heroes. Tell 'em what's good for 'em, sheriff. Just do what he says. Everybody keep quiet. Matt. Here they come! Don't try anything funny, Matt. Hey! Hey, there! Oh. Papa! Papa! He's dead. Round up a posse. I'd say you had a few questions to answer first. How come you to know this Gentry? I spent six years in the same cell with him. Listen to who's been giving us Lectures on law and order... A jailbird. Probably in cahoots with him. That's right. That's right. I was a jailbird. Six years in a stinking cell. Because I happen to look like another man. Six years out of my life. Because men made up their minds too fast. Men like you... so righteous, so willing to condemn. The law gave me a full pardon. If that's not good enough for you, You can have this back. How do we know he's telling the truth? Yeah. What kind of people are you... That don't know the truth when you hear it? I learned all about Gentry. How he thinks, how he acts. And now we can make it pay. Now, anybody wants to ride with me, Get a fresh horse and plenty of ammunition. And you better stay in town till I get back. She'll stay with us. Thanks. Be careful, Matt, please. Let's understand each other. You can head this posse As long as we think you're leading it right. Start taking us in circles, Matt, And you won't come back alive. Let's ride. This time you can use a deputy. Thanks. Find any trail? Nothing up that way. Must've stayed in the water to throw us off. They have to come out sooner or later. Why don't we split up, follow the stream both ways Till one of us picks up the track. Lose too much time. How close are the nearest towns? Kirby's about 20 miles north of here. And there's another place called Summerville Around the same distance south. How about telegraph... They both got it? Kirby has, but I ain't heard of none in Summerville. Ah. We'll head south. Comanche territory? Here they are. Pretty good at thinking like an outlaw, aren't you? I'm a jailbird, remember? Trail or no trail, they wouldn't cross that. It's four days without water in Comanche territory. They'd have to be crazy to do it. Maybe they are, but I'm not. Count me out. Didn't figure on this kind of a deal. What about the rest of you? Come on, make up your minds. Once you get out there, there'll be no choice. I'll take my chances with Gentry, not this. I didn't sign up to take on no Comanches. I'm sorry, Matt. I've got a wife and kids. It don't sound right to me. I ain't riding into no trap out there. Not with just a handful of men. What about you, Matt? I'm still sheriff. You done your job. We don't expect you to go it alone. Let's ride, son. Gentry would know better than to leave a trail like that. What happens when we catch up with him? A fair question, but don't worry. I didn't come out here to commit suicide. You better save that. My mouth's so dry I can't even swallow. Here, put this penny in your mouth. It'll keep your tongue wet. How long are we gonna keep going? Till we get there. It's no use, Matt, there won't be any tracks left to follow. Then we're going straight south. We can pick up their trail when this blows itself out. Come on! Why did you do that? Tell me why. You wouldn't quit. There was no other way of stopping you. Stop me from what? From catching Gentry... Finding out I was in on it. You... with them? Yeah, I was with 'em. Ever since you gave me that prisoner to take in. Remember? He offered me a deal and I took it. Even took that rap on the head to make it look good. Working with them. All this time. They needed somebody in town to set it up for them. I gave them the idea of Easter. When everybody'd be in church. All except Pa Swenson. I couldn't help that. Why shouldn't I throw in with them? What was I supposed to do, hobble up and down Behind a hardware counter the rest of my life? For $8.00 a week? I figured they owed me a lot more than that. How are you figuring on me? Kept hoping you'd give up. You didn't leave me any choice. It was either you or a rope around my neck. I figure I still got a pretty good chance. You know, if you were smart, you'd do away with me right now. But you're not that kind. So you're stuck with me. Only, when we catch up with 'em, I won't be on your side. It'll be one gun against ten. But they'll all be in front of me. Go pick up your gear. There goes your last card. One more day, and they'd have made it. Go down and take a look. They didn't take the money. Bring it up. No use straining your eyes. If they're still around, we'll know soon enough. Let's make some time, then. We keep on pushing these horses, we'll wind up walking. We will anyhow, if we don't give 'em a rest soon. We better hole up around here. Stake them out. Coyotes making a meal off your friends. So you were a jailbird. That why your wife left ya? Heard you talking to Helga on the porch one night. You thought I was asleep. I know about your son, too. That's why the fuss over me. Not 'cause you liked me. Just looking for somebody to take his place. Figured this out all by yourself, didn't you? I've had a lot of practice for a long time. Why don't you stop feeling sorry for yourself? You think you're the only one in the world Ever got a raw deal. I know, you spent six years in jail. Yes. And do you know something else? There's a lot of people in this world Who've had a tougher time than either you or me. It comes with the ticket. Nobody guarantees you a free ride. The only difference is, most people don't run for cover. They keep right on going, Picking up the pieces the best way they can. But you never hear of them. And the ones who can't take it, like you... The ones who're looking for the free ride, Who cause all the trouble everywhere. You wouldn't talk so tough If this had happened to your own kid. Oh, get some sleep. You didn't have much luck with either one of us. Did you? We better get going. I was thinking during the night. I'm the only one that knows about you. It only takes one. Very few men get a second chance. You mean that? Let's get outta here. Stay here. We can get to the horses. They'd ride us down in an hour. Stay down. Maybe they'll go on by. If they don't spot us before dark, Maybe we can get across the river. It's gonna be a long day. Everything set down there? Everything except the money. Give it to me. If we get separated, Be sure and get downstream as far as you can. I can't make it. Help me back. You never saw what happened to him, huh? I was busy enough taking care of myself. Musta swallowed 20 gallons of water. You think the money'll still be there? Why not? You sure you can find it again? All we have to do is backtrack up the river. Suppose the Indians are still around? I could be mighty curious for $85,000. You know, this figured out better than I thought it would. All set? Almost. I'll get the horses ready. Put out the fire. Go on. Go for it. How did you... Just too ornery to die Before you got what was coming to you. Go ahead, then. Get it over with. That's what I'm here for. Go on, shoot! What are you waiting for? To see me beg? Is that it? Save your breath. You're gonna need it When they put that rope around your neck. You haven't got the guts to do it yourself. That'd be easy, kid. But it might do somebody good to watch you hang. It might keep some other kid From turning out the way you did. That's all you're good for. You preach real good. With a gun in your hand. I'm not trying to preach. Preacher's gotta think there's something good About everybody. But there's no more good in you than in a rattlesnake. Don't try to blame it on your leg. If it hadn't been that, it woulda been something else. You'd have gone bad sooner or later, No matter what happened. First time the pressure got big enough. You just didn't have it in you. Helga tried to tell me, but I wouldn't listen. I was too smart. I was so smart, I thought there was still a chance for you. Still believing, right up to the very last. Even broke the law myself to give it to you. Maybe somebody else coulda found a way To get to you before it was too late. You had the whole town pulling for you. But you didn't care who you hurt... Swenson, Helga, anybody. You're just no good. Let's go. I thought you were drawing on me. Hold up, there. With Davey's compliments. And Davey? Davey did fine.
