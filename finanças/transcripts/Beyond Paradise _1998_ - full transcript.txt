Don't do that, especially around me. - Do what? - Look around like that, bruh. - Why not? - Because the locals, they think you're challenging them if you look 'em in the eye. - Really? - Really. - What else? - Well, you know that guy this morning in the parking lot? The one that got beat up? All he did was say this one local walked like he was real. Some cousin heard it in passing. Jacob got the crap beat at him. - By that big dude with no neck. - Shut the hell up, man. I'm telling you serious. - Well, what about the beaches? - No way, bruh. They're way worse than here. - If you want to go to the beach, you gotta use the one by the hotel.

Now the new king, Liholiho and two of Kamehameha wives openly broke the kapu system by eating together at a formal feast. They were supported in their actions by Hewahewa, the highest kahuna nui in the land. Now, Hewahewa was the one who actually torched the first heiau, the sacred altar used for human sacrifices. The Hawaiians had had enough cruelty and evil. As a matter of fact, this was six months before the first missionaries arrive. - [Mark] What? - Zulu, see me after class. (Ronnie laughs) Zulu, come here. Come. This is some information about a class I'm teaching tonight.

He's the one of putting crazy ideas into your head. - You're the one who's crazy. - What ideas, bruh? - Like going to college. - I didn't have anything to do with that. I didn't find out until you did. - Yeah, but he never would've done it if it weren't for you. - It's not my fault. Besides what do you care if he goes to school? It's none of your business. - Typical haole attitude. Do what you want and to hell with everybody else, yeah? - You don't know what you're talking about. - I know one thing. You're always gonna be a haole. (dog barking) - Hey, how's it? - Hey. - Listen, Ronnie Boy gets mad sometimes and- - I don't wanna talk about him. - Okay, okay, we won't talk about him. Hey, listen bruh, you want to go run an errand with me? It'll be fun, promise. - Okay, get in. Let me ask you something, what do you think about Lehua? - What do you mean? Like do I like her or something? - Well, you've known her for a long time, right? - Yeah, since third grade. - Well, do you think she'd, I don't know. - Oh, you like her or something? - Well, yeah. It's just, I don't know if she likes me. - [Keao] She does. - What do you mean? - She told me. We talk all the time. At least once a week. - Well, what'd she say? - I don't know nothing specific. - Really? But what'd she say? - I just told you. - Oh man, I don't believe it. - Shh. - What is it? - No more talking, bruh, okay? Be right back. (ominous music) Bruh, Yellow Bob. - Is that pot? (Keao laughs) (gun bangs) (suspenseful music) (man yelling) He's gonna kill us! (gun bangs) Oh, my god! (Mark and Keao panting) - Oh.

(laughs) - It isn't funny. - Did you see his eyes almost popping outta that big popola head? (laughs) - That guy almost killed us. - Hey, relax. - [Mark] I don't wanna relax. I'm sick of you and your drugs. - What? - I said I'm sick of you and your drugs. - You giving me a lecture now, haole boy, is that it? I don't need no lectures. - You act like this is one big game. - You know what? Ronnie's right. All you haoles, you're the same. All you guys can think about is yourself. - You and Ronnie are so quick to blame the haoles for everything. Have you ever thought that your problems are your own damn fault? You're so naive. - You know what, haole? I never liked you anyway. Oh that's right. The only reason we hang with you 'cause you got a truck. You're the one who's naive. - Why because I won't risk my life for some stupid drugs? - You don't know anything. Oh, what you think Lehua is just fat. You're probably the last person on the island not to know that she's of pie. That's right. Just think about that, haole boy.

Although you have to promise not to tell anyone on the school board, okay? This whole semester we've been talking about the true Hawaiian and the true Hawaii. Well, I've got some personal beliefs I'd like to share with you. And that is, there's only one race of people on God's green earth, the human race. And I think it's stupid to divide us by race because we're all related, yeah.

(suspenseful music) (Ronnie grunting) (board thuds) - Then on January 17th, 1893, a group of businessmen backed by former sons of missionaries and the US Marines overthrew Queen Lili'uokalani. They put her in a room in her own palace. And that's where she wrote the famous Queen's Prayer. Zulu, what is it? - This is the application. I need a letter to go with it. - When's the letter due? - The 14th. - And what's today's date? - June 2nd. - Which means that I've got about 12 days to write the letter. - Yes, sir. - Zulu, it shall be done. - Yeah, thanks, Mr. Kaneko.

Zuli said, "He won't see anybody and he is not taking any calls." - I'm sorry, Mark. I feel really bad. But you know you got a lot to do today. You gotta graduate. Ugh. - I don't know if I can go. I just don't feel like it. - You don't get it, do you? You are going, we're going together. Here. (both laughing) - I told you I don't feel like it. - Mark, don't be so selfish. Come on, do it for Bonnie. It means a lot to her. Come on. Here. Look at you. You look so cute. (Lehua and Mark laughing) - Get away.

Look, I'm sorry to trick you, but I wanted to see you before I left. - How'd you get in here? - Lehua's father pulled a few strings for me. He says he owes me, calls me the lifesaver of his children. - How is she? Lehua. - Good. The baby's fine. Very small but cute. She was in an incubator for a while, but everything's okay now. - What's her name? - Oh, you'll like this. Lilly named after Queen Lili'uokalani. (gentle music) - So what? Are you going to mainland now? - Uh, yeah. I got into school, believe it or not. - I believe it, bruh. - We'll see how it goes. But I'm coming home for Christmas. Look, Ronnie, I wanted to apologize for saying all the things that I did and acting like an idiot. - That was my fault. I'm sorry for choking you at Waipi'o. - Ronnie, I- - Let me finish. Sorry for choking you at Waipi'o, and for hitting you. I, I didn't mean it, bruh. I don't wanna be like my father. - I don't want to be like my father either. - So what's that? - This. It's a video I made. I gave one to Zulu and Keao. Sort of a gift. - For what? - Just a gift from your haole friend, okay? (Ronnie chuckles) - Okay.
