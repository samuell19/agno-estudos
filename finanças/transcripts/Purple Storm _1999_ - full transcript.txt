1979 CAMBODIA The Americans didn't defeat us. The Vietnamese didn't defeat us. We Khmers defeated ourselves. We failed because we didn't terminate our enemies fast enough. Dtaa taught us that... ...we can never accomplish our great revolution... ...or create our perfect society... ...without a powerful arsenal and advanced technology. You are the elite, handpicked by Dtaa. We are sending you away to learn new technology. For you to return to build a new order, a new society. Dtaa wants you to remember well: There's no new society without revolution, and no revolution without technology. Keep your promise! The Sea off Chek Lap Kok, Hong Kong. Here we are. (Korean) Proceed slowly. Everything is working out according to plan. Don't worry. The Hong Kong police won't find even one dead body. Number M-21647. All aboard vessel M-21647 listen: This is the Hong Kong SAR Marine police. You have entered Hong Kong waters. You have one minute to bring your vessel to a halt. And turn on all the lights. We are coming aboard. Custody Ward, Security Bureau Anti-Terrorist Force Headquarters. At the request of the Secretary of Security, the ATF now formally takes over this case. None of the twelve people found dead on the boat was HK Chinese. They are all North Koreans. Further information reveals they... ...were secret agents in the '80s... ...who became... ...mercenaries for global crime syndicates after they retired. This disc was found on the body of the injured suspect. It may have been damaged during the course of action. How long will it take? Give me a few more hours. Sir, information on the wounded suspect is coming in from the CIA. Wanted by the CIA, Todd. Born in 1972, Cambodian Chinese, suspected former Khmer Rouge member. Adopted by an American family in 1982; Record of abuse and running away from home. Studied electrical engineering at MIT, convicted and jailed for... For stealing computer information from the Pentagon. Suspect in bombing of... ...American Department of Commerce, Madrid, 1995. Suspect in blowing up of American tourist bus, Libya, 1996. Rumored to be the son of Soong, a former Khmer Rouge member. Soong. Sir, something new on Soong's father. More information about him. Soong, age 45, former Khmer Rouge member. He left Cambodia after the Khmer Rouge fell from power in 1979. Since then he has engaged in terrorist activities in the US. He has been trained by the PLO in underground military activities. In June 1990 an American military base blew up in Panama. In October 1993 food was poisoned at the American Congress. In March 1996 a Turkish passenger jet exploded in mid-air. 296 people were killed. Soong is suspected of organizing all these activities. He has been retained by different terrorist organizations. The man is a hired-gun. In his own mind he models himself on the thinkers... ...who offered their services to different lords... ...during the Warring States period of Chinese history. When I was going through anti-terrorist training in Boston. He was the subject of my case study. Why has he come to Hong Kong? I've kept my promise! (Khmer) Hey, let's play skip rope. I'll go first. That's what you taught me. The will... You said our will is man's greatest weapon. I'm using it to conquer the world. Why has the world fallen into chaos? More than anyone else, I cannot allow you, my teacher, to suffer this fate. Papa! The world has changed. Things are different. The important thing is that you have not changed. That you and I have not changed. We must save Todd. Bye-bye... New people (Khmer) No. New order. No. Kampuchea. No. Pol Pot. No. The last time Soong appeared... ...was in Mexico two years ago. If you were Soong and your son was in our hands. What would you do? Kill him. Superintendent Ma, we cracked the first file! This is a formula to produce a chemical weapon called Ricin-X. Ricin-X is an organic material. It is water soluble, and it can withstand very great heat. Which makes it a very effective chemical weapon. When Ricin-X comes into contact with the human body, it passes into the bloodstream very quickly. Causing red blood cells to burst. Leading to internal bleeding, and death within two hours the body turns a reddish purple. Like this color here. Ah-Moh, how did you break this file? I used the Khmer word 'Year Zero' as the code. Year Zero? In 1975 the Khmer Rouge began killing its opponents en masse. Over a quarter of the country's population was killed. They wanted to establish a new era. Which is why the west calls 1975 'Year Zero'. He had to start all over again by killing everybody? Moh, how many more files do we have? Two. - Hurry! - Yes, Sir! Sir, the suspect has woken up. Were you born in Hong Kong? I don't know. Do you like the colour red? I don't know. Have you stolen anything before? I don't know. Have you killed anyone before? Have you killed anyone before? I don't know. Who is he? Who is he? I don't know. In my opinion he has behavioral amnesia. Doctor, do you know how terrorists are trained? Why did you come to Hong Kong? I detected no apparent injuries to his brain. My best guess is that his synapses are damaged, blocking the passage of chemicals in his brain and causing him to lose his memory. Why did you come to Hong Kong? Why did you come to Hong Kong? What does 'behavioral amnesia' mean? It means someone loses his or her memory but not the memory of their survival mechanisms. He can't remember who he is but he remembers how to type or shoot a gun. Doctor, if he had really lost his memory, what would be his chances of recovery? I'm afraid I can't help you. And it doesn't look like he can help himself. But there's someone who may know what to do with him. Does the name Shirley Kwan ring a bell? 10... 9... 8... 7... 6... 5... 4... 3... 2... 1 Now we count the days backwards all the way back to the fifth day. I'll go back to that day with you. You will see me, hear my voice. When we get back there you will experience again everything that happened on that day and you will tell me everything you see. When you wake up, you will forget everything I have said. All right, Todd. We've gone back five days. Tell me, what do you see? Where are you? Do you see anyone? What is happening? Tell me. What do you see? It hurts... Hurts! Hurt? Who is hurting you? Who? What's hurting you? Who's hurting you? Daddy, stop! Your daddy is hurting you? No... Daddy, please no... Sorry... Stop it... Human consciousness works on three levels. Level one is consciousness... ...the state of being mentally aware of anything. Level two is the subconscious... ...which we enter by hypnosis... ...to retrieve certain memories or sensations. The subject will not remember anything upon waking up. Level three is the unconscious... ...which we still know so little about. The unconscious is my speciality. Our personalities and our understanding of this world... ...are conditioned by the unconscious. If we can influence the unconscious mind, we can change Todd into a good person, and make him work with the police. And that makes you what? God? Now I see why they say you're crazy. I believe in science. I believe that science can change people. That's just another fancy theory. All scientific theories have to be proved to be accurate. Or is that too hard for you to understand? I am an ordinary and unsophisticated man. I'm against abortion, promiscuity and cloning sheep. No matter what you say, there's still just one answer. No. I was wrong about you. The deceased is a Cambodian on our investigation list, that's why the police informed us. No signs of a struggle or poisoning. It looks like suicide. Rock, show them Soong's picture. Find out if they have seen him recently. Yes, Sir! I have committed suicide for personal reasons. I hope the media in Hong Kong won't make too much of it, and doesn't make wild speculations about my background. I hope the police don't waste too much time on my death. Why is the ATF involved in the North Korean cargo ship incident? No comment. Are North Korean agents involved? Can you say anything? There will be an official press conference later. Please be patient, thank you everyone. Ma Li, Chief of Hong Kong's Anti-Terrorist Force Between 1974 and 79, Pol Pot, to consolidate his dictatorship... ...in the name of... ...creating a new society... ...and weeding out... ...poisonous western ideas. Ordered the murder of two million Cambodians, almost one third of the nation's population. After 1979, when the Khmer Rouge went into decline, he began receiving military aid from the US and the UK, and taking part in a special airlift program. Pol Pot tried anything to stay in power. A former army lieutenant described him as a high class prostitute with Nazi ideals whose political convictions could be traded for power and money. He spent his life setting up his own dictatorship... ...and went to great lengths to murder all his opponents. But with his death, the Khmer Rouge came to an end. The tyrant ended his life in this shack. An uncertain future hangs over the future of Cambodia. Take Todd back to headquarters. Team B, standby. Mike, can you hear me? Mike? Bravo! Go. F.D., hurry! Yes, Sir! Go! Hurry! Judy, is Shirley still here? When you were 14, you had a new classmate. She was small and wore glasses. No one in the class paid her any attention. One day your classmates bullied her in the schoolyard. They pushed her and laughed at her. She fell down. And there was blood at the corner of her mouth. You went over with a bottle of Coke to console her. She smiled at you. That was the first time you saw her smile. The next day, she gave you a very beautiful butterfly. You've always had a strong sense of justice since you were young. You know you must not hurt other people. Wake him up. I have to speak to him. 1... 2... 3 Sorry I'm late. I'm Chief of Hong Kong's Anti-Terrorist Force. My name's Ma Li. What has that got to do with me? You are one of our undercover agents. Your name is Chow Sai-Kit, and you are Cambodian Chinese. You came to Hong Kong when you were twelve. Then you joined the police force. You have been outstanding in the execution of your duty. And since you speak fluent Khmer. We recommended you to work with the CIA. Two years ago, we sent you to the US on an undercover assignment and planted you in the unit of a known terrorist called Soong. Then something happened, and we lost contact with you six months ago. It's only today that we discovered that you and Soong had arrived here six days ago. You were injured, and captured by the police. You also lost your memory. We are still searching for Soong's motives in coming to Hong Kong. We only know he is carrying chemical weapons. I know you have done your best. So you must not be hard on yourself. We are all very concerned about you. You must be very confused, give yourself some time and rest. Soong will come back for him again. When that happens, I want you to plant a time-bomb next to him. Your name is Chow Sai-Kit; You were born in Phnom Penh in 1972. Your parents died when you were four; You were raised by your foster father. You came to Hong Kong when you were twelve to enter primary one. You finished primary school in three years and entered form 1. You joined the police force after graduation. Two years ago you were given an undercover assignment. The target was Soong. You wanted to finish the assignment as quickly as you could to go back to being a cop and to your girlfriend. Your girlfriend has long black hair, a pair of big eyes. She always says she's too fat and refuses to eat. That's not in the script. What on earth are you talking about? I want to go home. Moh brought many magazines. - Please be careful. - All right. How long have I been away? Ma Li said half a year. Why did I vanish? Did I say anything before I disappeared? No. Ma Li said, maybe Soong had you on a tight rein. That's why he wasn't able to contact you. This is your foster father. I remember him being really kind to me. You remember... that's good. What is it? Are you remembering something? Chow Sai-Kit! Chow Sai-Kit! Stop the suspect! Did I kill someone when I was an undercover agent? Just now I suddenly remembered something. It was like a scene from a nightmare. What kind of a person was I? If I had a warm family and a wonderful girlfriend. Why would I want to be an undercover agent? Human beings have choices, and you chose to be a good person. I want to see my girlfriend. Sure. Since you have nothing to say, I'm leaving. Don't. No. Please don't go. - Listen to me... - Let go of me! Go away! All right, all right. Please listen to me. Well? Go on. I'm on duty. It's so obvious you don't want to see me, I must have really upset you but I can't even remember what we were like. I can't even remember who I am. Then why did you come back? You left without a word. I keep waiting for you, month after month, people asked me where you went and I didn't know what to say. I kept asking myself if you'd had an accident or if you left because you didn't want to see me, you left without a word. Why did you come back after all this time? I'd given up on you; It was as if we never met. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Well done, Cindy. Is Ma Li there? O.B.! This is Ma Li. Who is it please? Soong. Do you know where I am? Where? At the Jubilee Reservoir. Do you know what I am thinking? What? Isn't human life fragile? That's what makes it so precious. I want my man back. I guarantee no one will get hurt. Tomorrow at noon. The flyover in north Wanchai. I want to see Todd standing there in the open, by himself. We found a disc on you, there are still two files that we haven't opened. If Moh can't crack them before noon tomorrow. We have to give you back. Try and find out as quickly as you can why Soong has come to Hong Kong. We are depending on you. Sir, I cracked it! I cracked the second file! Last time it was the formula to produce Ricin-X, this time it's an assessment of its destructive power. This phenomenon is called 'Purple Storm', The idea is to launch Ricin-X into the clouds and produce an explosion. A fusion of hot and cold air causes clouds containing Ricin-X to form and purple rain to fall onto the ground and into rivers and from there spread to other parts of the region. It's lethal for anyone to come into contact with it, either by touch or inhalation. But why July? July is Southeast Asia's monsoon season. They studied the weather patterns of the last four years to predict the same conditions in 1998. Now I understand. Year Zero is 1998. I deciphered the code with '1998' in Khmer. Then the third file... Is the date! It's in July! Right! I'll begin with July 31... ...and work backward, by days and seconds. Remember this e-mail address and this website, remember his identity. What if he wants to kill me? He took great pains to save you. You are very important to him. So what are our plans? If we can't capture him, kill him. Officer Lee, stay here! F.D., call headquarters, get us fire engines and ambulances! Target A! Fire! Judy, Rock, the 'hawk' is yours! Get down! Get down! Get down! Get down! All of you! Get down and don't move! Call an ambulance! Police! Get down! This is Rock Chan of ATF. One of our people is hurt, we need back-up! Block the roads! Stay back! Stay back! Call an ambulance! Quick! The police are investigating an accident that occurred in Central this afternoon. It seems a gas leak caused an explosion at the same time as an armed conflict broke out over a financial dispute. The two incidents are unrelated. Why don't you greet me? Commander (Khmer) Why didn't they plant a surveillance device on you? What did they do to you? Have you betrayed me? I've forgotten everything since I got injured. I can't even remember who I am. They even beat me... but no matter how they tortured me I really couldn't remember anything. We'll cure you. Now remember. I am your father. Say it. oa-bpook (father) oa-bpook! When our revolution succeeds, the souls of our comrades will rest in peace. You are my... We are family. Soon... Very soon we shall be able to go home. So our mission coming here is... She's waiting for you. She's your lover; Dtaa assigned her to you. Go. I'm sorry. Our prices are very fair, no one can offer you a better deal. The ship you just saw back there, it weighs 200 tons, it has absolutely no problem carrying containers. This one here is 50 tons heavier, so it can handle even more stuff, but of course it'll cost you more. If you want divers, that's extra... We don't want any, we have our own. But... Excuse me, is there a toilet somewhere? Toilet? Back there. Thank you. You can come pick up your ship at two, tomorrow. Thank you. Don't mention it. Let's go. Thank you. Bye. Call Superintendent Ma Li: 93666995. Oh, God... Deliver us your suffering sons. We are not afraid of toil and sweat. We're just afraid that we can't go home. Oh, God... Deliver us your suffering sons. Grant us a timely rainfall. Let us have a good harvest so we can go home early. Two years ago we chose you for an undercover assignment to get close to Soong. You should be proud your injury is for the revolution. What is the goal of our revolution? How long do we have to wait? Just a few more days. There will be peace after this storm. There will be sunshine after this rain. Do you know that when we left home... ...it was raining like this? And it's gone on for 19 years. 19 years. I am as impatient as you are. I have waited for 19 years. Let's wait a few more days. When this rain is over. We can all go home. We don't know how many people they have. We only know the identity of the two ring leaders, so only take action after they show their faces. Yes, Sir! Officer Lee will fill you in on the other details of the operation. The code name of this operation is 'Operation Hawk' Our back-up includes Officer Cheung's divers. Ma Li, why didn't you tell them Todd's an undercover agent? Will you hurt him tomorrow? There are things that I cannot predict. They may only be 'sparrows', everybody stay cool. Only take action when they are confirmed 'hawks'. Clear. Targets approaching. Let the 'hawks' walk into the net. Do you remember that time in New York? It was exactly like today, wasn't it? Those aren't military command gestures, that's... ...sign language! All units, action! All units, action! Action! Switch to Plan B! (Khmer) Roger! Brazil, 1989, Shirley July 3. Today the subject tried to save the police. He was playing the role we gave him of an undercover agent. But afterwards he also rescued the terrorists, the enemies that we'd given him. His behavior was incoherent. It is my belief that the subject is in a state of utter confusion. The recovery of his real memory is creating enormous contradictions... ...with the false memory that we planted in him. He cannot distinguish what's real and what's not, and is becoming schizophrenic and we don't know his present whereabouts. Didn't you say you were on my side? Are you injured? Didn't you say I was a good man? You are no longer what you were if you can forget the past. You can start all over again, and save an entire city. You're a doctor. You should have known I would eventually remember. I am a terrorist I only know how to kill people, I can't save anyone! If you only forget the past then you are no longer a terrorist. We shall give you a chance. Believe me. No! You're lying! Ma Li, the FBI, CIA... they will never forget that I'm a terrorist. You people shot to kill! You betrayed me! I'm a terrorist, and I'll be one all my life! No, if you were still a terrorist you would have shot me already. How do you know I won't? I am a good man... They say I am a good man. They say I am a good man. Let's go away. Let's leave this place, okay? We'll start all over again. We? If only I would forget the past they would give me a chance, they would give me a chance. Let's go. - Okay? - Fine. Let's go. Go where? Where are we going to? I think he's really gone mad. He's not mad; He really wants to be Chow Sai-Kit. Issue a warrant for Todd and Soong, say they are suspects in the shoot-out in Central. Go on. Yes, Sir! I lost my memory. They tried to trick me. They said I was their undercover agent. I wasn't myself. I truly believed I was an undercover agent. They told me to come back to betray you so I came back. Now I remember who I am. I am a party member. There are many things that I still cannot remember. Like the purpose of our revolution. But I remember most clearly... who's been kind to me, and who saved my life. I also remember your saying that... ...there is no me without you. We are running out of time. Dtaa only left us a little while ago. And they started surrendering, one after another. Two days ago the last of our army was forced to surrender there's nobody left for Dtaa but us. The 'Purple Storm' is our last hope. There's only one day left before the July 6 election. We must kill all those who turned against Dtaa before then. We must destroy all the civilization that has been polluted. We will start from nothing, create a new race for a new society. Lok! Lok! Lok... Lok! Lok... Was Lok our son? How old? Eight. Six when he died. Radio 21, could you find out for me... ...which division is car AM-8186? Buddy, hey buddy! Why? Why? I didn't shed a tear when our son died. You said it was a good thing... ...to die for the revolution. The children of the party are our own children. That day on the cargo ship I really wanted to shoot you and then kill myself. We didn't have a choice. Yes, we did. I chose you, and you chose the party. Delay the operation, while I get the bomb squad to clear the way. Rock, F.D. Break up the bomb squad into two teams. One team to Ching Cheung Road, the other to Highway 3. - Find out if there are any more bombs. - Yes, Sir! F.D., go to Kai Wan Road and remove the wrecked police car. Yes, Sir! Our schedule today is very tight so I'd appreciate it if you would get into the coach right now. Ladies and gentlemen, please be seated. As we are about go into the restricted area. Please keep your passes visible at all times and we'll stay together as a group during the tour, thank you! The process of relocating airport operations from Kai Tak to Chek Lap Kok is taking place in five phases over a three month period from May to August 1998. This is a restricted area. Do you have a permit? Sorry sir, we are journalists. I got it! Superintendent Ma! I got it! The time is 12 noon, July 6! Blueprint of Cambodia's Underground City. So the target of 'Purple Storm' is Cambodia, not Hong Kong. Get me all the information on air, sea and land transportation movements between tonight and tomorrow morning. Notify the SDU team, mobilize everyone. 90% of the SDU is already at the new airport waiting for orders. Shit! Why did you come back if you'd forgotten everything? I would never have come back if I were you. Flight RX-7458, scheduled to depart at twelve midnight the destination is Chiang Mai in Thailand. Inform Kai Tak airport, put all the agents on alert. Search the hangar of RX-7458, look for anyone suspicious. If they can't wait, start without us. - You stay at headquarters. - Yes, Sir! How many SDU members do we still have? One team, 12 people. Let me have two 6-man units, and have them approach from both sides. Target is RX-7458. Yes, Sir! Someone's here! Guan Ai! What are you waiting for? Get three police boats to Kai Tak and wait for orders. The bomb squad is still clearing the road for the convoy. Sir, Soong is hijacking the final flight. We mustn't let it take off. He's going to fly something, even if it's a paper plane. This is the place where the plane is going to land. Request ATC Clearance. Air Control. This is RX-7458... I'm taking you to the hospital. It hurts. It hurts so much. The truth is... we have a choice. Get after him! Go! Ma Li, Sir, this is the position of RX-7458. Who's there? All the things that we have done, we did for the revolution. One more day just one more day, and we would have succeeded. You know this. Did we ever do anything... ...for ourselves? Everything we did for the revolution. You've made so many mistakes, yet I can still forgive you because I still take you as my son. And you know it. Stop it! Don't say any more! Don't say any more! Get people to intercept them at the other end of the tunnel. Quick! - You mustn't let the flight take off. - Yes, Sir! - Everyone else follow me! - Yes, Sir! East gate of the airport, quick! Get Water Supplies ready to close off both ends of the tunnel. The suspect is carrying dangerous goods. Yes, Sir! oa-bpook! (father) You guys spread out. Rock, come with me. Call Drainage Services to turn on all the lights. Why? Why does it have to end like this? I used to admire you so much. I was happy and secure. I don't know if your revolution is right or wrong. I just know we can't kill so many people. The Khmer Rouge does not allow personal emotions. I'm wrong. I've made mistakes. I'm correcting them now. I accept my punishment. But it's you who should be punished! I don't want to kill people! You deserve to die! I won't kill you! Go! He's right next to us! Freeze! Freeze! Go. Headquarters, this is Ma Li, get Drainage Services to close the water gates. This is Ma Li. Do you read me? What's happening up there? I read you. This is Officer Lee. The east and west water gates are already closed. Fire Services is getting ready. All the injured people are on their way to the hospital. Sir, where's Todd? Call Fire Services to disinfect the other side of the gate. Yes, Sir. Hong Kong International Airport. If it is possible to start all over again. Do you have the courage to take that chance? To Todd, a friend in a faraway place. Chow Sai-Kit. I am a man of my word. What is it? Informer's fee. Thank you. Good-bye.
