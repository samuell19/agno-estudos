Who's Sunder? Your mother had fixed your marriage with him, in childhood. Yes. Come on, hurry! What's the problem? You can have Sunder meet Nisha any time. - It will be of no use. - Why? Because he has no wealth? And because he has no wealth, you want to break his heart! - I'm not breaking his heart?! - You most certainly are! As a child, I have drilled into his head that he'd marry Nisha. He's not met Nisha but she is the queen of his dreams. Now, should I go and tell him that... the one he'd worship in his dreams will never enter his life? Look! These useless talks will have no effect on me! I have told you, it is impossible! Many years ago, some man had said the same words to you. The father of your wife, Kamla, was also a rich man. And you were poor then. But victory was yours, not his. Kamla had left everything for you but you have forgotten that. Do bear in mind that your wealth will never triumph! The promise that Kamla and I made to each other will triumph! A penny for your thoughts! Is it true that my mother had fixed my marriage with her son? Yes. Then, why is father refusing? What do you want? Me? ...| have never even thought about it. - But... - But what? If a boy enters my life someday, and I fall in love with him... will father reject him also then? - Certainly. - Why? Because he has already fixed your marriage. - With whom? - With him. Well-done! You are amazing! I have personally supervised all the work since the last few days. Please sit. Sohan, I often think, if not for you, it'd have been impossible... for me to manage my business in this age. Your father Mohanlal and I used to study together in college. If he were alive today... I'd have spoken about Nisha to him, not to you. I will be indebted to you forever. Bless you. I called you now because Nisha and I... will be leaving for Darjeeling by today's train. Nisha and her college friends will be holding a show... for the Bengal relief fund. And even I have some work there. - But you have to go to the farm. - Why? We've got to finalise the disputed land dealing tomorrow. - Tomorrow itself? - Yes. Do you have some urgent work in Darjeeling? Yes... What do I hide from you? 20 years ago, I had bought some land on lease... from Mr. Mafatlal of Calcutta. The lease will expire in another 6 months. Mafatlal is no more. His son, Popatlal, who has just returned from abroad... refuses to rent it on lease again. - So, did you meet Popatlal? - No. I haven't even seen him. But I believe he is in Darjeeling now. I'm planning to go there, meet him and bring him here. I'll shower my hospitality on him and convince him. Not a bad idea. But it's important, you remain here too. Don't worry. I will lock Popatlal in a cage and bring him here! Hear, hear! I've written so many letters to him but received no replies. And she is going to lock Popatlal in a cage and bring him! - Leave that to me. - All right, I will! Go talk to him and bring him here. Once he is here, I will handle him accordingly. I will go and make the arrangements right away! Crazy! Mother, it's better that you forget about this. About what? That my marriage with Nisha was ever fixed. - Why should I forget?! - Because I have put it behind me. I've even forgotten her dad... whom I'd met for the first time in Calcutta last year. I gathered then that this was just not right. And I immediately stopped fostering any love for Nisha. You are lying! You're dejected but pretend to be indifferent to make me happy! But nothing is the matter! Nisha is not the only girl! There are thousands of other beautiful girls in this world. No! You will marry only Nisha! H ow? I will pray to God. Pray? Yes. Do you know, I dreamt about my friend Kamla? Seeing me disheartened, she asked me not to worry. As nobody could breach our promise. She told me that nobody else but my son, Sunder, would wed Nisha! Did she actually say so? Did you thank her on my behalf? Forget it. Let me get to the point now. I'm going by train to Neelgaon tomorrow or the day after that. No. I have found a job. A big landlord requires a qualified engineer. He's constructing roads on the hills. It will be a year's job. I'll be getting 500 per month and a bungalow and helper for free. Here's the letter. This is called the miracle of God! Meaning? Mother! What is it? You've been at home all along! Now, come with me! Where? A fantastic song & dance program for the Bengal relief fund... will be held today. I have a free pass, so I thought I'd take you along too. Go alone. The lovely maidens of Darjeeling will be dancing... who have driven half of the city's boys into becoming poets! The remaining have been dejected and are wandering in the jungles! Here, take a look. Where are you lost! What are you doing?! Somebody will see us! Quiet. What's your program for tomorrow? I will be returning to Neelgaon by train tomorrow night. We know that. But what will you be doing the entire day tomorrow? - I have some important work. - To hell with that! - Let's go for a picnic tomorrow. - Yes, let's go! Father has asked me to meet somebody. So, will you be meeting him the entire day? Father had leased some land... from a businessman Mr. Mafatlal... in Calcutta, 20 years ago. He is no more, and his son refuses to extend the lease. His name is Popatlal, and he is in Darjeeling these days. Fantastic! How does Popatlal look? I haven't even see him. I phoned his hotel today but he was not available. I've left a message asking him to meet me at 9 a.m. tomorrow... .or phone me. - But what will you talk to him? - I don't want to talk to him! Father had asked me to bring him to Neelgaon somehow. Once he reaches there, father will somehow convince him. But why should he want to get convinced? Once I ask a man to come along, it's difficult for him to refuse! _ Really? _ Yes! If you don't believe me, then come and see tomorrow morning. How he will swoon over me! We'll come to the hotel tomorrow. At 9 a.m. Good morning, Ms. Nisha. There's a gentleman here to meet you. He's here! Yes? ls his name Mr. Popatlal? Is your name Mr. Popatlal? Yes, it is Mr. Popatlal. You can well imagine how a boy whose name is Popatlal looks! H ow? Dark, short, with his stomach coming out of his shirt! Hide! Popatlal has just one 'po' in it! - What? - Yes! However, my friends in London call me Monto. May I come in? Let's sit? - Are you alone here? - Yes. - Tell me. - Pardon? - Well, you called me here. - What... Oh yes! I did call you. You do know that I am Mr. Roop Singh's daughter. It's obvious, looking at you! So, why did you want to meet me? I didn't want to meet you. My father had asked me to meet you. Well, your father is quite sensible! - What! - Yes. - That's for me. - For you? I mentioned at the reception that I was expecting a phone call. Hello. This is Popatlal speaking. Congratulations!! Not congratulations but Popatlal! I want to speak to Ms. Nisha. - She doesn't want to talk to you. - What! Who are you? I now know what a despicable and wretched person you are! Stop saying what! I could break your head! Do you know the outcome of being so impertinent?! If you are her bodyguard, then I can have you sacked! Really? Mr. Sardar writes letters, appeasing me all the time. And you, his servant, dares to talk to me so rudely! Absolutely! Our policies differ. I know how to deal with crooked men like you! I'll whip you now! Stop that! I'll make mincemeat of you! I'll teach you a lesson! Were you fighting with somebody? Fight? He was an old friend from Calcutta. This is how we talk. I was afraid. Yes. Villagers get frightened very easily. What do you mean by villagers?! You're from Neelgaon, right? So what? I've always been in Darjeeling and done my B.A. also from here. Yes! Even the villages have progressed quite a bit. Your father asked you to meet me, huh? Yes. He'll be very happy if you come to Neelgaon with me tonight. - With you? - Yes. It's a beautiful place having lovely gardens, lovely animals... Look! These gardens, flowers, animals do not fascinate me. Don't mind but I'm from the city. I've lived in metropolises. Gardens, flowers and animals cannot draw me there. But yes! If there's something that can lure me, it is your... beautiful eyes! So, will you be coming with me? No. Why? Your father and me are not of the same age. Whom will I talk to? To me. - Whom will I go out with? - With me. I admit your eyes are lovely but eyes don't mean everything. - No? - No. A man tries to get to the heart. But if there is the love of an animal in that heart... then you can well imagine the outcome! - I don't quite understand. - I'll explain. I'll speak about the moon and stars, you'll talk of vegetables! I'll speak of couplets, you'll talk of your buffalo milking... What are you saying?! Do I look that rustic to you?! Villagers start fighting for no rhyme or reason! You're the one fighting! Do you know I can discuss any issue of the world with you?! I am well versed with all types of songs and dance! You may be speaking the truth but I wonder why I'm not convinced! Can you actually sing and dance? Please don't start now! I have absolutely no time. I have to go to Darjeeling club to watch Ms. Pony's dance program. Do you know Ms. Pony? So, did you have him swoon over you?! Just you wait! I'll make him come to his senses right away! H ow? If I don't make Ms. Donkey of Ms. Pony, then I'll be damned! Sit here, while I go and get ready! Good Lord! She's like lightning! We certainly won't come, Nisha! No problem. I'll go. - Why did you do that?! - Quiet! - I am badly wounded. - Where? Where have you got hurt? On my knee. Arrogant lad! He thinks I'm crazy about him! I could make you go crazy! I admit you are quite smart but I don't give a damn about you! The flames have erupted. It's difficult to douse them! Father has asked me to bring you along... or I wouldn't be with you for even a minute! However, if you speak to me properly, I could like you. But love? ...lmpossible! - Love? Impossible? - Absolutely! No... I remembered a dialogue from a drama. From the drama of life? No! Certainly not! - Why doesn't the truck stop? - It stops for two reasons. One, if the engine fails and two, if it collides with an ox! You talk so strangely! In London, the girls wouldn't think so. But the girls back home deem it strange! Where have I got myself trapped! Do you think I am very pleased to be with you?! Even if you are, how can you say so? You want your type of a man! What do you mean by my type?! Do you want to argue with me? You're the one who wants to! Ever since I've met you, you... you... Keep your arms around me this way... Say that you are angry. Friend, this is amazing! Where have you brought us? Pardon? We were in a rush. Your truck was before us. But we've come elsewhere... Right? - How far are we from the city? - 25-30 miles. 25-30 miles! Good Lord! I say, buddy... repair this and take us back. I'll give you Rs.20. - We don't have any time. - Come on now! Take Rs.30. Here are some crisp notes! Come on, agree! Take this. You look like a newly married couple. No, we are not yet married. - You will be, soon? - Something like that! Repair it. I'll go with her. Check out his wallet. There must be around Rs.500. I was thinking the same. - Do you have some 'ladoo'? - A box full! I'll feed them. That moustached man is a strange fool! "You look like a newly married couple!" Do you look like my wife in any respect?! Well, neither do you look like my husband in any respect! - Exactly! - That's what I'm saying too! Sir, these are my engagement sweets. Please have them. Fantastic! I'm hungry too! Please have, madam. - I don't want it! - Please don't say that. - You'll break a poor man's heart. - Yes, you will. The sky is spinning, isn't it? Yes, very swiftly. It's not the sky but our heads spinning! - They've added something to this. - What? - Some narcotic. - Narcotic? They have very dangerous intentions. What will they do? I don't know what they feel about you. But I think they found my wallet more appealing than you. Meaning? My senses are totally numbed. And they will vanish with my wallet with great ease. What's so funny? You were being very smart, huh? It will be fun now! And suppose they take you also away with my wallet, then? Why would they do that? They would know why. But it is possible. - Then do something. - What? Those men will abduct me, and you won't react?! I'm helpless. If we were in love, I'd have staked my life. But that's not the case. It isn't so. I like you very much. How does just liking me help? I... I... I even love you. Really? Yes. How much? This much! Are you trying to fool me? What? ...No way! I really love you. My heart holds many a desires and wishes for you. I mean I... You cannot look into the eyes of a person when you are lying. Even if you didn't feign to be in love with me, I'd risk my life. They're coming. - Now do as told. - Okay. - Laugh like a madman. - Okay. But how much money did you lose, trying to save me? - Not a penny. - Meaning? I mean. Hey! Do you appreciate me now? Let's scoot from here. I can't run anymore. No problem. They can't catch us now. Are you feeling intoxicated? - What about you? - Yes. Twice as intoxicated. One, due to the 'ladoo' I ate, and the other, due to these eyes. They are indeed very beautiful! Goodness gracious! When you wake up, I'll be gone. Whatever transpired with me, has never happened before. And I suppose, it's never happened with you either. I know it was the effect of the drug. But had it been the effect of love, imagine the outcome then! It's simple. If you wish to test, then call out Monto thrice. I'll be there. HE'S left?! You said you'd be leaving tomorrow or the day after that. And now, you're leaving suddenly? It's the question of my job. I have to go soon. - Shall I come along too? - No, mother, not as yet. Let me settle things in the cottage first. I wanted Nisha to meet you just once. Once she agrees, then her father will never be able to refuse her. I see. I believe he loves her very much. I see. Hey! Are you listening to me or just saying, I see? I see. Mother, don't worry. Everything will be fine. - I'll leave now. - Wait. Let me kiss you. Porter! Hurry up! Hey you! What is it?! The matter is very dangerous. What's wrong? There's somebody else here other than the two of us. Who? - A girl. - A girl?! - She's inside. - Inside! - She's very beautiful. - Beautiful! But absolutely insane! A song! I'll sing a song! You rascal! I'll teach you a lesson right away! But had it been the effect of love, imagine the outcome then! It's simple. If you wish to test, then call out Monto thrice. I'll be there. I knew you were going to be in a bad shape. - Really? - Don't worry. One endures great distress in love! It's not your fault, for fire rages in your heart too... .as it does, in mine. You are wrong. There's no such thing happening here. - Pardon? - No fire rages in my heart. - No? - Absolutely not! Then, why did you call me? To prove to you that I know you're here! - You don't need me at all? - No! - Me going away won't affect you? - Absolutely not! - You won't mind? - Not even a bit! - Believe me, I'll go! - Go ahead! I shall jump from a moving train! Go on! You will run and hold me back. If you say, shall I open the door for you? - Is that so? - Yes, it is. Watch how a life is taken! "0' picturesque landscape, 0' twinkling stars and moon!" "Be witness to my death!" Madam, your love is going to die for you! My final salute! - So, when will we meet? - What do you mean? I mean you will go home, and I will search for a hotel. Don't you know there's no hotel here? This is a remote place. And anyway, father has invited you. Come home with me. But... You think you shouldn't go since he's not here to receive you? Well, father is not at home right now. He has gone to settle a disputed land dealing. He'll be back in a day or two. This means, it's just you and me at home! My aunt is also there. Move aside! Impertinent man! Take the luggage and go out. I'll fetch a newspaper. Porter, pick the bags. I told you, she is absolutely crazy. She must have taken away my luggage. Go and check. Porter! Bring it out. Get my umbrella. Excuse me, are you Mr. Popatlal? - Damn! This is bad! - Why? What happened? Sir, I am Mr. Roop Singh's accountant. When he heard that you were in Darjeeling... he left to meet you there. He's taken a lot of money with him. - Do we have to return? - Most certainly. - When is the next train? - This will go after 10 minutes. Secretary, put the bags inside. Sorry, I got a bit delayed. Mr. Sohan, you told Mr. Roop Singh that you were meeting Banwari. But you have come here instead. What's all this? - How much is this? - 3,000. You had promised 10,000. How can I arrange for money every second or third month? If Mr. Roop Singh suspects, my job will be at stake, and... And if you try my patience too much, your life will be at stake! But what can I do? From where do I arrange for so much money? I believe, Roop Singh never keeps his money in the bank. His lifetime earnings are kept in his safe at home. It's no difficult task for you to make the safe key disappear. - But... - I give you just 3 months time! If I don't get the money by then, the cops will know your secret. Sir, if you don't mind, then may I ask you something? What? Who is Khanna, and how did you get trapped in his clutches? This dates to a year and a half back. Remember Nisha's friend, Shanti, had come to stay at her place? I remember very well. In fact, I even remember one night, when Ms. Nisha fell ill... you had taken Ms. Shanti out in your jeep. After that night, we kept meeting clandestinely every night. Then one night, she started sobbing. What's the matter? Why don't you say something? I can't hide it any longer. Hide what? That we will be soon facing trouble. - Trouble? - Yes. We've got to get married soon. I know Mr. Roop Singh wants Nisha to get married to you. But Nisha is my friend. I will tell her the truth. Don't mention it to her! Why? Do you want to get married to Nisha? No, this isn't so. I managed to convince her, and sent her to Calcutta. After some days, I went to Calcutta. Shanti was staying at Hotel Imperial. I went to her room at night. I knew we'd get married the next day after you arrived. But for how long would I keep it a secret? I wrote a letter to Nisha today itself. - To Nisha? - Yes. I gave it to the manager a while back and asked him to post it. - How long back? - Around an hour back. - What have you written? - The truth. She is my friend. How can I hide anything from her? I've written about you coming here, and us getting married. Sohan, what are you doing?! You're wondering that I arrived today and am already leaving. I received an urgent telegram. "What you try and hide, blood will reveal" It will be better if you come inside. Please sit. Do sit. Don't worry, the police won't know until morning. And by then, you will have returned to Neelgaon. How do you know I'm from there? Well, I know everything about you. I have the letter which Ms. Shanti had written to Nisha. - You do? - Yes. I forgot to have it posted. You can give me the letter and remain silent about it too. Name your price and I'll give it! Your wish is my command, sir. Then, give me the letter. Its price - Rs.50,000. - 50,000? - Yes. Give it in instalments. Once the payment is done, I'll give you the letter. How much do you have right now? 5,000. No problem. 5,000 will do. Take this. But how will I be assured that the police will never suspect me? Don't you worry. You will be relaxing far away, in your village. And the police will be tracing some madman! Since then, Khanna has me trapped as he has Shanti's letter. And I am sure he won't give the letter even after getting 50,000. Since he knows, I'll be marrying Nisha and inheriting millions. It will be better to forget him for the moment, handle him later. First tell me, when will you be getting married? Mr. Singh wants us to get married next month on her birthday. I asked him to talk to Nisha. Forget about talking, sir. Just get married! One never knows when the old man will back out. The old man won't back out. It's the girl I'm afraid of. You're here? You took so long to change? But where do we have to go? Just come with me. You'll forget London and Paris! Let's go. Let's go. If people disapprove of us meeting... and if I yet want to meet you, do you know what I'll do? What will you do? I... I'll be near this tree and beckon you. And you come to me then. You will come to me, won't you? Tell me, have you seen something more beautiful than this? Yes, I have. You lie! Where have you seen it? If I turn my face, I can see it. People who have travelled overseas are very deceptive. Such beautiful maidens are even more deceptive. How have I deceived you? I haven't given you a chance. So, you think I'm being deceptive towards you? Why would you bring me here then? What is your implication? That your eyes and talks are deceptive. And your courtesy is going to last only for a while. And I've brought you here because father wants your signature... on the agreement of some rotten land?! 0' God! I didn't know, you thought me to be so amoral! Listen to me, baby. What's wrong? Have you sprained your foot? Don't you touch me! - It may get swollen. - It's not your foot! It certainly isn't but I don't like anybody's foot swollen. Who cares what you like and what you don't! I swear when you fight, you look just like a... A what? A villager! Don't you call me a villager! You are a villager! What's happened to you? I didn't know there was a ditch behind. Please come to your senses! I promise I will never fight with you, I'll do as told... I'll heed everything you say! I'll serve dinner. In the meantime, freshen up. I'll freshen up in a jiffy. Yes? What is it? - Is he the one? - Yes. Last evening, Ms. Shanti came to ask for change worth Rs.5,000... at the reception counter. I said I didn't have any. This gentleman was seen near the counter then. He told Ms. Shanti that he would give her the change. I then saw him go to her room. What's happening? Do you know her? No. Is this your picture? It was found in Ms. Shanti's suitcase. Who is Ms. Shanti? I don't know any Ms. Shanti... How much money do you have now? Money? I suppose around Rs.200-300. Can you show it to me? The testimonies of the accused, Sundernath, and the witnesses... proves that on the 15th night, the accused, Sunder... was attending his friend Subodh Mukherjee's marriage... and was at his friend's house the entire night. The court is convinced that he had no hand in Shanti's murder. And so the court acquits him-not guilty. - Don't you want to eat dinner? - Pardon? Where did you find this? In the cupboard. Whose picture is it? My sister's. Sister! She was my friend. But we were in the same class from school until college. And then? ...| mean, how did you get separated? Somebody murdered her. Murdered her? ...Who? The incident occurred in Calcutta. When I learnt of it, I was so shocked that I took ill. The doctor told everybody not to speak about it. Even after I improved, everything was kept a secret from me. Yet, I learnt of quite a few things. What? That some wretched man killed Shanti for Rs.5,000. He was arrested too. But on the basis of false testimonies... the charge was proved to be untrue. How can that be? ...| mean someone else could be the killer. Impossible! The police report said the killer had trapped Shanti in his love. That's why his picture was found in Shanti's suitcase. And when he was arrested, the police found the Rs.5,000 too. And then, there is also the testimony of the hotel manager. How could the court be misled then? Fake witnesses and false testimonies! But the whole world is convinced that he is the real killer. The police are investigating the case again. I am sure that they will arrest him again someday. And this time, he will not be able to escape. Maybe, the police will apprehend the real murderer this time. You talk of the real murderer again! He is the actual killer! Neither me nor anybody else have any doubts about that! Do you know his name? If I knew his name and address, I'd have strangled him to death! Father is here. I will go and inform him. I had promised him that I'd bring Mr. Popatlal here. Mr. Roop Singh? - Yes. - My name is Popatlal. - Secretary, say yes. - Yes. - Secretary said yes. - Oh! Mr. Popatlal! - Sohan, he is Mr. Popatlal. - Hello. It's good you're here. I had asked my daughter to... Nisha, meet Mr. Popatlal. What! Mr. Popatlal-the one whose land we have. Hoodlum! Hooligan! I'll break your head! He's a real cheat! Don't worry. I don't get offended by what she says. But you should show her to a good doctor. Yes... What! The doctors in Agra can cure the worst of mentally ill people. Get lost! What's wrong with you, Nisha?! He is not Popatlal. Mr. Popatlal has come with me from Darjeeling. - With you? - Yes. Come with me. You'll know who is genuine and who is an impostor! Mr. Popatlal. Mr. Popatlal. Go on, call him! Do you believe me now? Secretary, say yes. - Yes. - Secretary said yes. Hey! Who is it?! Secretary, behave properly! Secretary, indeed! People are waiting downstairs for dinner. Dinner! I'll eat chicken! Charlie, we have to be very cautious. Chintu, don't worry. I'll trap the old man in no time! And if you don't, you will spend your entire youth in jail! In jail! If we succeed, then we'll own millions! Millions! And then, we'll share the loot. I work hard, and you want me to share the gains! - Secretary, say yes. - Yes. - Secretary said yes. You have not taken anything. Don't worry. I will surely trace that hoodlum! And when you find him, bring him to me. I'll shoot him to pieces! Mr. Popatlal, how long do you plan to stay here? You see... my land which you possess now You're here to extend its lease? I want to sell it... Secretary, say yes. - Yes. - Secretary said yes. Do you want to sell the land? There's an offer worth 100,000. Secretary, say yes. Yes. But I have the foremost right over those lands. You certainly cannot sell it anybody else. But I have already given my word to that planter. - But I want to give it to him! - But... The land belongs to you! Give 100,000 by tomorrow morning. Tomorrow morning? ...Well, my attorney has gone to Darjeeling. Once he returns after 15 days, I will have the deeds prepared. How can I wait for a fortnight?! Come on, Mr. Popatlal! This is a beautiful place! You will be taken around. And then, Nisha's birthday also falls this month. Oh! Her birthday? Happy birthday! It's not just her birthday on that day but her wedding as well. - Wedding? - Yes. She is marrying my friend's son Mr. Sohan who is also my manager. I'll have such a grand wedding; it'll leave everyone spellbound! She's upset with today's events. Nothing seems to fascinate her. Fantastic! The work has begun again after such a long time. If you have any problem, then tell me. Thank you very much. Do your work. I'll just look around and come. My dear, you have never hid anything from me. But today, I feel that you are hiding something from me. You don't object to this marriage, do you? You are strange, brother. ls this a question for you to ask? Fine. You ask her, and then tell me. And yes! The Arab businessman is hosting a party tonight. He has invited all of us. Popatlal is a strange character. He just refuses to come. And I can't leave him alone either. Go with Sohan. The Arab will be pleased. - I don't want to anywhere today. - Why not? I don't feel like. You'll feel better going there. The Arab's girls sing & dance well. It will be a grand program. I said, I don't want to go anywhere! Fine! Don't go. Were you madly in love with him? Love? Then, why are you mourning? Mourning? I just don't care about him! And whom should I care about? A cheat, a fraud?! After all, what does he mean to me? Are you explaining this to yourself or to me? To you! - I have understood. - You haven't understood a thing! I haven't gone out all day, I am not going for the party... so you think that I... Fine! Tell father that I will surely go for the party! I am not feeling sad at all! Come on, it's your turn now. I'll recite a verse. It's not about any particular person but about the world. "In this world of want and craving" "I've witnessed many a desires change" "There's deceit here, and greed too" "I've witnessed one's integrity change" Fantastic! "Wealth casts a spell so enchanting" "Good it is, to let this spell torment you" "The silver coins tinkle" "Because of it, I've witnessed people change" He sang so well. Excuse me... you know that we are going to get married. We should try and understand each other. Come, let's talk. This is no time to talk. Go away! - I want to talk to you. - But I don't! If you didn't want to talk, you wouldn't have kept the door open. Before you tell me that you hate me, I want to say two things. You are angry with me because you think I'm a cheat or a bandit. Who impersonated Popatlal to loot your father. But this is not true. Your father has met me before and he knows very well who I am. You are absolutely correct. I know you, and that too, very well! If not for your aged mother, I'd have had you behind bars now! Stop staring! If you wish good, then quietly leave! The one who is here to stake his life, will not fear such threats! I'm here to listen to your decision. And only then will I leave. - What decision? - About Nisha's life and mine. How are you concerned with her life?! I'm concerned with her life just the way she is, with mine. And this dates back to before Nisha and I were born. I have already answered your mother regarding this. Your answer alone cannot decide Nisha's life and mine. - No? - No. I can shred you to pieces for this impertinence. But I won't because you are not in your senses, you are crazy! Just once in a lifetime does every man feel that he is crazy. Try and remember that even you had experienced such a moment. Even you had fallen in love with the daughter of a rich man. Even her father had thought you were mad, and had threatened you. Yet, both of you had got married. Believe me, when you were unemployed at that time... my mother provided you shelter, not because you would... become rich someday but because your wife was her friend! If she fixed her son's marriage with your future daughter... it wasn't because you would roll in luxury someday... but because your wife meant more than a sister to her! What do you want to prove by saying all this? Even we are going through the same phase as you once did. Even we should have the right to live our lives as per our wish. Just the way you had once asked somebody the same. It shouldn't happen only because two friends had made a promise... but because Nisha and I love each other. Perhaps you don't believe me, but it is the truth. If it weren't the truth, Nisha wouldn't remain silent. We've made our decision. It's your turn now. Nisha! If he is speaking the truth, then I'll never stop you. You may leave this place with him right away. But after that, the doors of this home will always be shut for you! I will not see your face till my last breath! Come on, smear my face! Come, Nisha. Come on. Come, Nisha! You have got your answer. She will never come with you. I will never call you again... never! Perhaps you're in a rush, huh? ...Go on. This will suffice for today. Nisha has no inkling that I have invited you from the city... for her wedding. She will be very glad to see you. Come on. Mother! No letter or telegram? Or I'd have come to receive you at the station. You aren't sitting idle, you are a working man now. Anyway, I'm glad you're here. The place seems good. Do one thing. Send Sunder to my office. I'll ask him in private. He may answer me. Good bye. A wedding? This is Nisha's wedding card! She's getting married tomorrow! I now know why you are dejected. Why you suffer from a loss of appetite! Why you wake up in the nights! Luckily, I found out. I'll see how this marriage takes place! I'll go to Mr. Roop Singh right away! Mother! ...You will certainly not go there. - Why not? - Because I'm asking you not to. I can't bear to see you hurt. This time, I'll meet Nisha! Will you beg her love for me? And is your son so wretched that he'll accept her alms?! I won't ask her for alms but for my right! I'll remind her of her mother's promise! How will a girl who can't keep her own promise... ever bother about her mother's?! What are you saying! Have you already met Nisha? And did she also refuse? I wish she had rejected me the moment we had met. But it wasn't so. I was shown colourful dreams. And I blindly began to walk on a path which had no destination. When I opened my eyes, I was all alone. She was gone. And my love, of which I was so proud, had perished. Then... then I realised how deceptive that innocent face was! How misleading those smiling eyes were! How much venom there was in that melodious voice of hers! So many injustices have been inflicted on you... and should I yet remain quiet? This can never be, Sunder! I will go to Nisha right away! For what?! I can't bear to see you getting torn apart from within! I will ask her to return your happiness and peace. That's not in her hands, mother! It is not!! This heart has endured being letdown. It fosters no desire for anybody now. All it holds now is hatred! In spite of all this, if you still go to that house, then I... .| will leave you also! Excuse me. I want to tell you something. Mother was not there. Perhaps she's gone to the temple. Your bridal attire. It will be testing time tomorrow. On one hand will be Sohan, on the other will be me. If you doubt your decision even for a while, then tell me now. I will never compel you. I will not speak about my broken heart and tears. Nisha, even if you become mine, out of pity... it will not be a victory for our love but a defeat. And I will never be able to bear this. No. I need no answer or promise from you. - Yes. - Come with me. Let's go. Thief! Popatlal is here! He's here?! Where are my clothes? Let's go. The poor man is a very nice person. Just like my brother... understand? What's the matter? The real Popatlal is here. You impersonated Popatlal for a girl. And we did the same, for money... understand? What's your program now? I have no clothes or money. Help your younger brother so that he can return to Darjeeling. I'll be indebted to you forever, brother... understand? - Do one thing. - What? Leave the place instantly or I'll remove the remaining clothes too. Understand, brother? Come with me. I don't have a penny! Where do I bring the money from?! Mr. Khanna and you know that. My duty was to give you this letter. Don't worry. This is a hollow threat. If the law will get to you, then even Khanna cannot escape. Because he has falsely testified and hidden your letter as well. I know. But I'll be sentenced to death, and he, for only 2 years! Just forget him. He'll certainly not come during the wedding. Yet, this marriage will not take place so easily. If he won't come, then somebody else will. Just let him come. I have my men ready for him. If I don't make mincemeat of him, I'll be damned! And what did Nisha say? She didn't say a word but her eyes said it all. Mother, wait for us at the hermitage. When the sun rises tomorrow, everything will be crystal clear. Either, I'll have Nisha's hand in mine, or... Don't say a word more! Stop being stubborn. There's still time. Stop the wedding. Or you will be disgraced in front of everybody tomorrow. You want me to salvage my honour and ruin my naive girl's life?! But I am Nisha's father! You are destroying your child's happiness... and yet call yourself a father! You are an executioner! If fleeting moments of sorrow can turn into a lifetime joy... then I am prepared to be an executioner! Listen to me carefully. Go and tell Nisha that... the guests and the groom's people will be here tomorrow. And she will marry only Sohan. If that rascal, Sunder, comes here, then he will be dead meat! What's this! Why is the bridal attire and jewellery lying here? What are all of you doing?! Pick this platter and deck her up. Did you hear me?! I will certainly not take this platter to her! There's no henna applied on your hands nor is your hair done up. And neither has anybody decked you. If your mother were alive today... | wouldn't have felt so lonely and helpless. The world would turn upside down but she wouldn't have left me. And she, herself, would have dressed you in the bridal attire. A bridal attire or a shroud? You are right, my dear. If you wear this and come down, it will remain a bridal attire. If you return it, I'll think that I stitched a shroud for myself! If you return it, I'll think that I stitched a shroud for myself! The honour of my love lies in your hands, don't malign it. Don't malign my love. Don't malign my love. - I stitched a shroud! - Don't malign my love. Stop! If you move ahead, I'll shoot you! Wait! ...| said, wait! What's wrong, uncle? Who is this man? He won't heed this way! If you permit, then I'll tackle him! Sunder! One gesture from me, and you can be blown to pieces! But I don't want blood to flow on this auspicious day. It's in your good to return right away! Did you hear me?! I'm not proud of stepping at your doorstep. If it wasn't a custom for the boy to come to the bride's place... | would have never stepped here. Shameless man! Perhaps you don't value your life! If I didn't value my life, I wouldn't be here to face death. Don't try my patience, I'll kill you! You may fire bullets at me, your friends may shred me into pieces! These vile dogs, living off you, may tear me apart! Right?! Don't threaten me! Look carefully! This rifle will not reflect my death. Instead, you will see your arrogance and vanity in it! It's not a combat between your strength and my helplessness! It's a test of truth, principles and of love that will never die. The love that you want to crush! It's a duel to decide whether we have the right... to make or break our lives or if people like you do! You are vain about your strength, and we have faith in our love. Pick your rifle and shoot me. But do remember that if the love between two people is true... if two hearts crave to meet... then, let alone you, even God cannot be a barrier between them. You've made similar challenges of love before but were beaten. But that was the first step to success. The first victory of love. And today... today, my destination lies before me. Catch Nisha and thrash that rascal! Beware! Wait! Before you get them married... | want to tell this naive girl something. My dear, I am a stranger for you. And I have no right to advise you. But before bestowing your happiness on him, do realise... that you are not his first wife but his second! Nisha, please don't heed him. This is an outrageous lie! It is as true as the fact that we are looking at each other now! She too had become a bride just like you, wearing a white sari. And that sari became a shroud for her! And do you know what that unfortunate girl's name was? Her name was Shanti. You are lying! What proof do you have? Come with me, I'll show it to you right away. If you haven't seen it, then look! He is the one who had stabbed Shanti to death. For a mere Rs.5,000! He is the criminal who produced fake witnesses... and false testimonies, and deceived the court! But the murder of an innocent person does not go a waste. The long arm of the law encircles every criminal's neck! And this is the outcome of Shanti's killer too! This man is an enemy. Please do not believe a word he says! The court has acquitted me, since I had nothing to do with Shanti. I had never ever met her! I wish you had never met her! I wish you had never cast your evil shadow on her! I wish she'd seen the vicious and deadly side of you... under the facade of your good looks! But no. It wasn't so, my dear. She had to die young. She is no more. And today, when you have become a bride... the soul of the dead watches you with a shroud wrapped around. And pleads before you. Celebrate, get married and forget your friend's pleas! Because a person becomes blind in love! But the Lord above is not blind, deaf or mute. He will surely provide justice! Where are you going, Nisha? Believe me, I'm innocent... I am innocent, Nisha! He'll remember it all his life! But what proof do you have? When I throttle the hotel manager... he'll have to speak the truth and say who the actual killer is! Or I'll surely commit a murder although I haven't done so, yet! - Please listen to me. - Let go of me. Please listen to me. At least, take an injection. And then go if you must. Doctor, please come here. Mr. Sardar will go to reach Khanna to the station tomorrow at 7 a.m. There will be just four men in the jeep. Mr. Roop Singh, Khanna and Khanna's two bodyguards. You will be waiting on the way, armed with your rifles. The moment they reach there, finish off all of them. But, Mr. Sohan, the police will conduct an inquiry too. Yes. But they'll have their suspicions on Sunder, not me. Everybody witnessed today how Khanna dashed Sunder's hopes. And Nisha went out of his hand. Who else but Sunder can be after Sardar and Khanna's blood now? I understand. Please forgive me. Sunder, we ought to inform the police immediately. Go to the police station with Mr. Roop Singh. And you? I have to settle scores with Sohan. - Bad news, Mr. Sohan. - What happened? Sunder reached there with the Arab and his companions. - I did shoot Khanna's men. - What about Khanna and Sardar? Even they are badly injured but Khanna may have revealed it all. Scoot from here. Sunder must be on his way with the police. You wait here... Tiger, get the jeep... The others, come with me. Lock her in the bathroom. Leave me! Let go of her! Come on! If we go from the rear side, they wouldn't know. And you can easily arrest Sohan then. Okay. Let go of me! Wait or I'll shoot you! Shooting an unarmed person is not an act of bravery! If you are a man, then throw this and face me! This is enough for today.
