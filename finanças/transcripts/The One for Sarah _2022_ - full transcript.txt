Right, this is fine. Thank you. Oh, hey, hey, hey. Hey, lady. Did you just call me lady? Oh, what's the name? Oh, Sarah. Come on, let me drop you at the gate. You can't even remember my name. In fact. Babe, it was awful. The guy couldn't even remember my name. Do not make me do this again. My name is Sarah. How hard could that be? Babe, don't laugh. It's not funny. I'm not laughing at you. I'm laughing at how upset you sound. Like you are hurt by the situation. On a more serious note, babe. You know, bros was probably just looking for some sweet, sweet loving. I know exactly what he was hoping for? I mean, he's not even my type. Absolutely not interested. Well, it has been a while since you had some sweet loving. And I know because you told me. Why do I tell you these things again? Because you love me for starters. Anyway, you know what you need to do. Yeah, yeah. Loosen up. You tell me this all the time, but I just want to meet a decent guy. Why is it so hard? All the guys I meet are just pigs. Well, my darling, all men are animals. I mean, the wilder the better. Is that all you ever think about? What else is there to think about? Where are you? You sound like you're outside. Yeah, I'm still outside. But um yeah, almost at the gate. - The back gate. - Sarah, back gate? What time is it? Oh shit, he's about to close the gate. Hurry. Run, run, run! I told you. Hurry up! Kabiru! Please, please. Kabiru! Kabiru, open this gate. Why do you always do this thing? Did you encharm your mouth? I should open the gate? Check your time! - It is 10:02 pm. - Oh, very good. So you want me to walk all the way ‪-to the first gate? ‪-That's what you will do. - You have to walk to the first gate. - Why are you doing this? What should I do? Do you want me to lose my job? ‪Should I lose my job? Should I lose my job? Look let me tell you, even on judgement day, if Angel Gabriel locks the gate and his nephew comes late, he cannot open the gate. Please Kabiru, open the gate! ‪All you are saying is just English. ‪Just open the gate. Oh, it's English. Okay, you know what? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. My bad. I take full responsibility. Hello, I'm speaking Yoruba right now. I cannot open the gate. Go through the front gate. Kabiru! Kabiru! - I'm sorry. - Kabiru, open the gate. My bad. Should I scream thief? No, no, no. I'm not a thief. - I'm just... - So what were you thinking? What's this? No, no, I... erm... No, I was trying to... Look, please I really need your help. What're you doing? Stop. Can you stop taking pictures of me please? What're you doing? Stop! Look, can you just stop please? Can you just help me? Well, this is just a reminder that it actually happened. Delete it. - Delete it! - Aaah delete it. Do you want to come down? Can you just help me, please? Good. How did you? Alright. Come here. Oh my God, you are so... What the... Do you mind? Oh, my goodness. Can you just delete that picture please? - Delete it, or I will... - Or you will what? Just delete it, please. - My life depends on it. - Because of a picture? Delete it! Okay, fine. I'll do anything. I'm not going to sleep with you. Okay. Here you go. Happy? Eww! Take your phone. Hey, have you done some modeling before? You should consider it. You have... No, and I'm never going to model. Good night. Where's my 'Thank You'? Babe, This guy was definitely a perv, and he had so many pictures of half naked women on his phone. I'm sure he just goes around taking pictures of people. You didn't delete the picture? Of course, I deleted my pictures. But this guy literally saw me hanging from a fence and was still taking pictures of me. Who does that? This Kabiru!! I'm amazed at your security guard? Gateman oh! Gateman! But he has a uniform. Whatever. Anyways, side gist. So, how hot is this our pervert, on a scale of one to... Jason Momoa? Don't roll your eyes at me you know I can't see you right? - I'm not rolling my eyes. - You just did again. I can feel it in your voice. So let me guess, we're avoiding this one too, right? Definitely avoiding him. I can already tell he has a lot of drama. Sarah, you know I love you to death, right? Aha! She loves me. Whenever you say you love me means you're about to enter my matter. Okay I'm listening. What's the problem? I just feel like we should lower our guards a little. I mean, how do we find the one when everyone is a pervert to us? This guy was a perv now. I'm not saying he wasn't. Okay, bad example but still! Babe, I know where you're going with this. But no, I'm not going to deal with anyone's drama. You, of all people, know how much I've gone through to get to the person I am today. You know not everyone is like that bastard, right? Please, I don't want to hear his name. Don't say it. I didn't even say his name. I don't want to hear it, babe. Why are you doing this? Alright. Listen. I just don't want you to end up being lonely, okay? And if you continue to persist, lonely you shall be. And what about you? Hmm. What about you? You haven't talked to anyone new in a while. That's because I don't want anything serious. So you're not lonely? Well, I have you. - Listen, I have to go, okay. - Goodnight. Goodnight, darling. I am beautiful. I am strong. I am successful. I am a phenomenal woman, and I am great. Let's go. I am beautiful. I am strong. I am successful. I am a phenomenal woman and I am great. I'm great. Thank you so, so much for coming. - Please have a nice evening. - You too. Take care. Hi. - Hi. Good evening ma. - How are you? - I'm good, how are you? - Very well. Thank you. I thought you'd be closed before I got here. Well, about to close but I can't say no to you. Good. What are you getting this evening? - I'll get this. - Okay. Let's see. Let me get this. Okay. Good choice. - And this. - Okay. Is everything okay? Yeah, I've just had a really long day. Anyway, what's the occasion? I have a hot, sexy date with my husband tonight. You look absolutely amazing right now. I know, but I wore this last week. - You know, I have to keep Andy guessing. - Okay. - Let me get this. - Here you go. - Thank you. - You're welcome. So you've been married, what, 14 years? 15 years, darling. 15 years! And you still gush over your husband and even go on date nights? Why not? Marry a man that loves you and can provide for you and the world is right as rain? Definitely. Oh, wow... You look absolutely beautiful. Thank you. I'm jealous. I could never pull that off. Of course you can. You're just not extra like me. Here. Thank you. Are you sure you're okay? Yeah, I'll be fine. Very well. Just a second. Here you go. - Thank you. And you have a good evening. - You too. - Are you sure you don't want your change? - I'm okay. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Wow! She's so lucky. Oh, Jeez! I need to go. ...if you don't know, that's your business. Yes! Can you see what you've done to yourself? You have torn your clothes. - I don't know why you're running. - Oh, leave me alone please. Leave you alone? I don't know why you are running this night. Just be grateful you were not wearing a wrapper. You would have bared your nakedness. Especially... That's actually what I would like to see. Just be careful about moving around at night so you don't get kidnapped. I have spoken my mind. Hey! Here, you can cover yourself with this. Come on. Thank you. I haven't seen you here before. You're new, right? - Uh, yeah. I moved here... - Let me help you with your bag. You don't have to. No, it's okay. Thank you. Yeah, I moved over here about a few months ago. - Oh, careful. - Yeah. If I report him then I will be called a wicked person. This guy saw me walking towards this gate, I was running actually towards this gate and he still was closing the gate. I mean, who the hell does that? I know he can be like that sometimes, ‪but he's not doing it ‪to be wicked or anything. The Estate was robbed. He left the gate open when ‪he wasn't supposed to, so you know, ‪he can be a little... I know you're angry, but just try to... understand where he's coming from. I'm Sarah. Fred. You need a hand? I could walk you to your flat. No, no, it's fine, really. - Yeah? - Yeah. Thank you for your blazer. I will have it dry cleaned and then I'll get it back to you. - Don't worry about it. - No, no, no. I insist. Alright. - Um, here's my card. - Okay. Heavenly Lord, your name is wonderful. Your name is excellent. Your name is beautiful. I worship you Lord. - Well done sir, well done ma. - Yeah, Kabiru. I worship you Lord, for you are mighty You've got the whole world... I'm so sorry. I will call you... and then get it back to you when it's ready. Sure. - Good night. - Good night. Thank you. By the way, please don't tell anyone about this. - I promise I won't. - Thank you. If it happens again at least you have my number now. I would have come running though. I won't let no one see you like that though. That's not funny. - Good night. - Good night. Hey, hon. You still awake? Yep. Watching a movie. Oh, okay. What movie are you watching? Three Thieves I have been here laughing like a fool since. Yeah, that's a good film. And you know I told you anything with Frank Donga in it is bound to be good. Yeah, you did. Yooo!! That reminds me. Let me give you gist. So, you remember that - woman I told you about the other day? - With the caramel skin. That one. Exactly! So she came around today. Per usual, she went to chairman's office. She spent a really long time there. Next thing, the chairman's wife walks in, ‪almost like she had an informant ‪that told her or something, went straight to the office. Sarah, if you hear the commotion, the noise was off the chain. - Apparently, she had caught them together. - In the office? I'm telling you. And then this other lady starts to cause a scene and I'm like, Yo, Sis! You're the side hen, be quiet! Relax. She didn't break his head. Chairman's wife? Not at all, I told you that woman likes to act posh and classy. In fact, she was like, "Akpan, I'm going to divorce you, You useless man." You are something else. I can actually imagine what she sounds like. I'm serious. That's exactly how she sounds. - Are you there? - Yeah, yeah, I'm here. I'm here. Sorry. I just had to get a needle and thread. For? Kabiru struck again. Hmm. Yep. Madam! - Good morning ma! - What is it now? Madam, are you still angry? No problem. I just wanted to tell you that ‪I know a tailor ‪that can mend your torn cloth. Don't worry, I'll fix it. Thank you. I shouldn't bother about it? I'm the one who crossed my boundaries. I'm sure she will eventually give it to a road side tailor. - Ah! Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. Is there anything I need to know? Oh yes, there's a lot but Mr Adeshola is waiting in your office. - How long has he been here? - Oh, not too long, like five minutes. But I already gave him refreshments to keep him entertained. Nice. Tell Frank to bring the proposal I need for this meeting. Oh, it's already on your table. Have I told you you're the best receptionist? You haven't said it today. - Have you had lunch? - No, not yet. Awww! Oh my goodness. Have I told you, you are the best boss ever? - You haven't said it today. - Thank you. I'm so sorry Mr Adeshola. - No, no, no! - I'm so, so sorry. "Hey, Fred. How are you?" "Just wanted to say I got your blazer and it was really good to..." "Hi Fred, got your blazer and just wanted to..." Jeez! What are you doing? Just call. That's fine. We need about a month to sort all of this out, and that's mostly because of the tax officers. You know how this people can be. So when we are done with... sorry, excuse me. When we are done with all of this, we can now... - sorry about that. - No problem. Yes, so when we... as soon as we're done with this, we'll just take it from there. Alright. That's, that's fine. I have a plane to catch now, so I have to be off. - Sure. - Alright. - This is cool. - Yeah. Alright. So, I'll talk to you later? Absolutely. As soon as it's ready, I'll let you know. Right? - Alright. - Cool. Stay beautiful, Gloria. - Thank you, bye! - Alright. Frank says the proposal for Phoenix International is ready. And this is it. Sorry, one second. Wait, hold on. - Hello. - Hello. Sorry, I missed this call. - Who is this? - Hi, it's... it's Sarah. Sarah? Oh... Sorry, Sarah from the estate. Oh! Sarah. How are you? Wait. Did you get your skirt ripped again? It's only afternoon. No, I didn't. I didn't. But I did try to call you. What if that was the reason why? Oh, so we are allowed to joke with this now. Um, I got your blazer back. I could probably come and drop it by in the evening, if that's okay. How about tomorrow? Oh! You're busy? Well, I was hoping that I could take you out on a date, you know... Yeah. So we could just go somewhere nice, maybe dinner or we could do drinks... - Hello. - Yeah, hello. Sorry, I think network is really bad. Yeah, definitely the network. Yeah, so. I was saying if it was okay to take you out on a date, you know. I... We could just hang out and do drinks. Unless... Unless you have a boyfriend or... fiancé. I don't have one. Erm, husband? I'm not married. Mehn, that would have just been terrible. - Awkward. - Not nice at all. So see you tomorrow? We don't have to do anything serious, we could just have a few drinks. And I can leave if I feel uncomfortable? Yes, you can leave when you feel uncomfortable. - Okay. - I'll come pick you up by 2pm tomorrow No, no, no, it's fine. Just send me the address and I will meet you there. All right. I'll text you the address. See you then. See you. Oh my goodness, Lizzy. "Oh my goodness, Lizzy." So talk to me, is our sister going on a date or what? Our sister is going on a date! Lizzy, what's all these? What do you mean? Please! ‪Give me all the gist. ‪All the information I need to know. - There's no information. - Excuse me! Hello! Please, talk to me. Go, go, go. Tell me, tell me. Is he tall? Is he handsome? ‪-Does he have money? ‪-Why are you so excited? - Dark? Light skin? Big nose? Whatever. - Why are you so excited? Because it doesn't happen everyday. Come, tell me! No way, I'm not telling you. Excuse you! Okay fine. He's tall, he's dark, he's handsome, he's a gentleman. He's... - That was... - Hmmm You were saying something. Don't take her to the cinema, take her to a more fun place. Keyword F-U-N. Somewhere like an arcade, or something. Gloria, mind your business. Yes boss. So the Pheonix International has... - Babe! - Hmm. I don't know, man. What? What if he's a horrible person? Or a liar. - God forbid, what if he's like... - Stop! I know where you are going with this and you need to stop. Okay! You can "what if" from now till tomorrow, but you'd never find out unless you go out with him. So do that and just relax and have fun. Do you have what you're going to wear? No, not yet. Most of my stuff is at the dry cleaners. Well, it's a good thing we're in a store that has all sizes, especially yours. ‪Oh no, I don't think ‪I want you to do Ankara Guess we'll have to search. Nope. Too big. Too black. Black and white? No! Yellow? Uh-uh. Sarah! Did you make this? Yes, I made it and no, I'm not wearing anything from the store. - I mean, that would just be... - Desperate? I was actually going to say unprofessional, but yes. You're being very silly. You need to look sexy. I'm not going to wear anything sexy. I'll take this. Wait, this is not even your size. They're not mine. They're yours. Lizzy, you can't just... It's my money and I can do whatever I please with it. Okay? You hear me? Besides you're going to give me a discount anyways, so why not? Listen, I just think you should go there and have fun. Okay? Relax yourself. You probably will get laid. Is that all you ever think about? What else is there to think about please? So, you'd let me know how it goes. No. Excuse me. Will you? Yes! What?! Come on give me a discount. I'm not giving you any discount, Lizzy. If I wear my own clothes, that's the discount. 100% off. You don't want to go. But you know what? My God is bigger than you. Because we can afford it. You know I'm running a business. Whatever. Wait! When did you start making men's clothing? Is this what...? Take your things and leave, please. What a lovely coat. They're yours not mine ma'am! Can I have my card? Muchos gracias mamita! Make sure you call me. Make sure you let me know everything. Don't do what I wouldn't do... Actually, I would do everything. So don't be like me, but call me and let me know how it goes. Okay? Maybe. - Excuse me. - OK, fine. I will. I'll call you. Don't play with me. - Don't forget the bedazzled jacket. - Go away. - Bye. - Bye. Oh, hi! So sorry, we're closing. Oh no, I just want to get one quick outfit I promise I won't be long. - Just one quick outfit, please. - Okay. - Thank you. - Five minutes, please. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Hi big bro. Yes, I am in a boutique now. It's just in the next building. - Sorry, what's the name of your boutique? - Infinite, infinite, yeah. Infinite boutique. Yes. Okay, see you soon. Alright, Bye! Sorry, my brother is on his way here. He's the one paying for everything. But he's going to be here very soon. - Okay. - Thank you. Welcome. Hey, how far? Big bro, hi. Hi. Seen anything you like? ‪I have. I've seen some things ‪that I think you'll like. I like this one. This is your colour. - Yeah. - Alright. So just these two, yeah? So, I was just kind of thinking that since you're the best brother in the whole world I'll just... hold on... and then you'll just pay for it... I want these two. Please. It's fine, if you pick anything else you will pay for it. Thank you. Thank you. Hi! We're going to take these two. Okay, no problem. Sorry. He's like this sometimes, just ignore him. ‪Yeah. So how much is everything? So you work here? Actually, I own the place. She owns the place. - Boss lady! - Yeah. What's your name? - Thank you. - What's your name? Will you stop? She doesn't want to tell you her name. Well if you don't tell me your name, I'm going to call you... - Fence girl. - Oh my God, stop. I'm sorry, he's like this sometimes. Savings, please. You know it's bad manners to be rude to your customer, right? Oh my God, let it go. - Are we done? - There you go. Your receipt is in the bag. - Thank you. - You're so welcome Thank you. - Are you not meant to help me carry it? - Would you carry it my friend? - My hands are hurting. - Do I look like your boyfriend? - Move. - Can't you be a gentleman? -Thank you very much -You are welcome. - Bye! - Take care. Gentleman indeed. - Thank you, fence girl. - My name is not... Don't think too much, you can do this. I... am... beautiful. I am... I'm strong. I am a successful woman. I'm a phenomenal woman. And I am great. Oh God, what am I doing? Come on. You'll be fine. You can do this. You can do this. You're beautiful. You're amazing. What would Elizabeth do? Yeah, yeah. I'll be fine. I'll be fine. Thank you. - Hi. - You look amazing. Thank you. You look good, too. So sorry, I'm late, by the way. No, it's fine. I mean, I still think it would have been a better idea - if I came to get you from estate. - No, no, no. I mean, we're on a date. So this is mutual ground. - Yeah? - Yeah. You know, I really still think you shouldn't have. I wanted to. Alright. - Let me drop this in the car. - Okay. - Alright. - Ready? - Let's go. - Okay. Do you want one? - Yes. - Okay. - Thank you. - No problem. Thanks. - This is cool. - This is very nice. Okay. Why is that hair that long? - You don't like long hair? - Oh! It's not bone straight. That's cool. - Hey. - Hmm. What is this supposed to be? I don't know. - I think it's... it's a fish. - A fish? -Yeah -No. - I see a bird. - A bird? Yeah. Yeah. Okay, what? You're supposed to - break my head in the process? - Wow. How do you see a bird? I see a bird. - It's a fish. - No wait, hold on, I see a fish. - Yeah, it's a fish. - No. What? I see a bird and a fish. How can you see...? Okay, now I see a dog. You know, I... - Yeah, I think we should... - Leave. - Oh yeah. - Oh, finally. - Oh! - I've been waiting for you to say that. Okay, let's leave. I'm beginning to have a headache. I don't know. - Seriously? - No. Okay. - Seriously? - Look, I didn't know what to do. Yeah, your head was literally like this the whole time, and mine was like this. - I couldn't figure out what the thing was. - I was confused. - I was very confused. - Definitely confused. Like, I mean, seriously? Aww, mehn! But, why did you bring me here for real? I mean, this was so boring. I don't know. I thought you'd like it. It's art. I don't like that kind of art. Oh, okay. So, what now? I don't know. Dinner? Maybe a movie later on? A.k.a Netflix and chill. No, come on. Okay, okay. Look, I have... - I have an idea. - Okay. But I think you're a little overdressed for it. Yeah? - But we'll fix it. - Okay. - Can we go? - Yeah, sure. That was so much fun. - Yeah, it was. - Yes, it was. Oh, my shoes please. - Sure. - Thank you. - I'll put them on later. - Sure. - Are you ready to leave? - No, not yet. Alright. So let's take a walk then. Then the sky looks beautiful tonight. Okay. What? I mean, it's just a cheesy thing to say. I mean, but it's fine if you want to go for a walk, it's fine. I thought women like cheesy. Says who? My ex-girlfriend. She... She says I'm too serious and too uptight sometimes. That women like playful, cheesy, funny men. So I decided to be more cheesy. I think it all depends. I mean, it's not a one size fits all type of thing, you know. Some women like cheesy and some like serious. Some women even like playboys. Oh, okay. What do you like? I just want him to be kind. Kindness is not something you just see. I know. Do you think I'm kind? Well... I think it's too early to tell. But I feel like with time, I'll be able to see. Why are you laughing? Because that means we need to get to know each other more. And also, it means we'll spend more time together. Which means I get to know you more. Hmmm. But why... why... kindness and nothing else? Nothing. It's ex-boyfriend, huh? Something like that. I just feel like kindness of melts the heart in the most meaningful way. What? Nothing. It's fine. I need to use the restroom. Oh, can I come with you? Ah, Fred! - What? - It's been a really good night and you've been great company, but I think you going to the restroom with me would be a little bit weird. Don't worry, I'm not going to run away like Cinderella. I'll just take care of this guy. You do that. I don't understand you. Where is she? Big baby. Fred! Relax, just hold on. Where is she? Come on over. Wait, wait. Just relax. Let's just go into the car. - What? - Easy, easy, easy. Just take it easy. Vera, can you just get a grip? Behave yourself. I'm good. You're not good. Can you sit down properly? Hmm? What? Can you sit down properly? Thank you. Where is she? Here. How are you feeling? My head is pounding. Good! Maybe that will teach you to stop drinking too much. Heard you were on a date. You know, Gloria should start minding her business. I can't find her. Her number is not even going through either. Yeah. She probably looked for you, couldn't find you and she left. Yeah. I'll look... I'll call her in the morning. Let's get you home. Vera, don't throw up in my car. Can you stop this? I'm taking you home, I can't do this. Could this night not just get any worse. Kabiru! Kabiru! Kabiru, please just come and open the gate. Please! I can't take the front gate now, it's too far and it's too late. Please! Why didn't I just take the front gate? Fence girl! I swear I was thinking about you now. Where are you going? It's that way. The gate is locked, genius. I've got the key. You have a key? I and Kabiru have a special arrangement. I've got magic keys. Now, how do I always keep meeting you by the gate? Fence girl! My name is not fence girl. But you didn't tell me your name that's why I'm calling you fence girl. Look, just leave me alone, please. I've had a really long night and I cannot be bothered with any of this nonsense. Please. Good night. Where's my 'Thank you'? Good night. "Good night. I'm tired." I was here with my sister. Her designs are to die for. You can check it out. You'll see. - Hey fence girl. - What do you want? Is that how you address your client? Oh, wow. I'm so sorry ma. Good afternoon. How can I help you? Michael here tells me, you're good. I'm here to see for myself. Did you... design this yourself? Yeah, these ones over here are actually my designs, and these are the items that I stock. Are these all? No, no. So basically, these are samples I tend to do, like a print and on-and-off type of thing. It just depends on customer demands. Can I show you some samples or sketches? Oh, this is nice. This would look good on our Kenyan model. But in, red. Perfect, perfect. I like. Perfect. Okay. I told you. - I have to run now. I'll call you. - Alright. Thank you. So, are you ready to talk to me now? What was that about? I have a business proposition for you. By the way, you owe me an apology and a thank you. Let's hear it. Thank you. Apologies. That's not sincere at all, but it's okay. I'm doing a catalogue for her agency and we were hoping that you will provide costumes for the models. So? What say you? Wait. Why me? Because I love your designs. That's why I brought her here. Clearly, she agrees. What's the catch? Go on. You might as well tell me. What is the catch? What is in it for you? - Catch? - Mm-Hmm. There's no catch. This is business, strictly business, plain and simple. Obviously, we're going to... have to do it for cheap because we're buying in bulk. And I'm going to need you around to make adjustments for the models. You know, see if they need... I'll text you the dates, I'll think about it. Sure. Here's my card. - Hi, Michael. - Joy. How are you? - Great. - Good afternoon ma. Good afternoon. How are you? Sure you'd shop here. Well, you know I only shop from the best. Bougie, much. I hope you're not hitting on Sarah? Sarah?! I mean, she's hot, but no, it's just business. Strictly business. Good. Good. See you over the weekend. Sarah. I see you finally gained some attention. I mean, you know him. Oh yes? I'm a fan of his work. He's one of the few photographers that I respect. He does shoots for fashion magazines and models. Please, you need to hurry up. Hubby will be here in any moment from now. Sorry, sorry. Another hot date. He actually came here with a woman said that they want to use my designs for the shoot or something. -I don't know, but- -That's really good. - That's good news. - Okay. Yeah. For the simple fact that he came here by himself. Oh, I'm proud of you. - Thank you. - You have nothing to worry about. He's a good guy. Well, he can be a bad boy, but you get the drift. - Yeah. - Show up. Get your work done. And everything else will follow. Alright now. - Thank you. - Alright, my darling. - Do you want your change? - No, no, no, no, no, no. - Bye bye. - Bye. Hey, Gloria. Yes, boss. Have you heard from Mr Adeshola? No, not yet. I tried calling him a few times but I couldn't get through to him. What is wrong with people and their phones today? What exactly? You can shut down when you're done. I'm leaving. So early? Are you okay? I can't concentrate. Too much to drink? Not enough to drink. I saw Vera and... Vera was drunk enough for two of us. Yeah, she told me. And she said your date disappeared. Yeah, I spoke to Kabiru. He said he's seen her, but... and she was fine, you know. So I'm confused. Then why did she leave without telling you? What happened? I'll tell you when I know.

We even had fun. Well, at least I thought we were having fun. I haven't been able to reach her since the last time we went out. Gentleman! I'm sure you were playing the good guy card, right? Maybe she like bad boys. Hook a brother up! But, seriously though. You're already in love with her, right? You really don't waste time, Fred. You're already in love. Look, I don't know about love but I know that I really like this girl. Oh, wow! That serious, huh? Yeah. So tell me, what happened? Talk to me. I don't know. I've been trying to call her. I've even sent her text messages, but none of my calls are going through, so I don't even know if her phone is stolen or if she blocked me. Look, I feel like a stalker and I can't even concentrate. - You said she lives in the estate, right? - Yeah. Find her! Or better still ask Kabiru. That guy knows almost everybody in the estate. That will make me look desperate. - You are desperate. You're oozing off it. - Please piss off. Aren't you the one in love. Mr Lover Man! I'm sorry. That's true though. Alright. Tomorrow after work. You're going to do what tomorrow after work? ‪Kabiru. - Yeah. - Okay. The student has finally become a teacher. Oh yeah. - Clap for me. - Get out! - Won't you clap for me? - For what? Bro, I need to take a shot of this. I don't want to forget it. Yes. She blocked you. What is wrong? Oh, my battery is dead. Hey, babe. Expecting someone? Somewhere to be actually. Yeah. Let me guess.

Why don't you give her to me? She's not an object. Mr. Adeshola, she's a person. Yes. Of course. She is. - I'm sorry. I didn't mean no disrespect. - No, it's fine. - It's okay. It's alright. - Yeah. - Nice doing business with you. - Same here. - Alright. - Same here. - You'd hear from me. - Absolutely. - Alright. - Alright. - Gloria! - Yes, please. So you can shut down when you're done. I'm leaving. - Oh, okay sir. - Alright. - See you later. - Alright. Oh... I'm sorry, is this Sarah's apartment? - And you are? - I'm Fred. I'd like to see her, please. You should have called first. Well I tried, but her number is not going through. Well, that's because she obviously doesn't want to talk to you. Could you just let her know that I came to check on her? Please. Sarah, don't worry, he's gone. Sarah, look. If you ask me I'd say this Fred guy doesn't really know anything about this whole thing. Lizzy, don't. I'm just saying. He doesn't seem like that kind of guy. Did that guy seem like the kind of person? Every morning, and every night, I sit there and I read that thing. And I thought I believed it. But I'm still the same person. Nothing's changed. He's still able to do every single thing he used to do to me. I'm not strong. - I'm ugly. - Sarah, stop! - I'm stupid. - Sarah, stop it! - Coward. - Sarah, stop! - I'm not right. - Sarah, stop it. Everything bad. ‪-I know what I'm talking about. ‪-Sarah! - I'm none of these things. - What are you doing? Stop it! Stop! Give it to me. Stop! Here. Read that. I already know what it says. Well, I want you to read it out loud. I am beautiful. Louder. Stand straight. Your back. Thank you. I am beautiful. With confidence, Sarah. I am beautiful. I am strong. I am beautiful. I am strong. I am successful. I am a phenomenal woman, and I'm great. Did you hear yourself stutter? I don't want that. Say it with confidence and you better take the tears back. I am beautiful. Yes, you are. - I am strong. - Absolutely. - I am successful. - Oh, most definitely girl. I am a phenomenal woman, and I am great. Of course you are. I mean, you have me as a friend so you are great. Come here. And we're not going to let that bastard do it again. Okay? - Thank you. - No, no, don't thank me. - Get the pen and paper. - Why? Because you tore all that down, you have to write it again. - Lizzy. - Yes? Yeah? Hey, Fred. Sorry, I was out of town. I won't be back until tomorrow. Would you be open on Saturday? - No, we're not. - Oh, okay. Where do you stay? I can come by your place on Saturday. I'd like us to discuss in person tomorrow. Can't we just meet in my office on Monday? No, this is urgent. If you're busy, I mean, it's okay. I can take my business somewhere else. No, no, no. It's... It's fine. I stay in Ubah Estate. Alright. I know where that is. - I'll see you tomorrow. - Yeah. Sarah? What happened to your face? - Nothing. - Can you go, please? - No, I'm not leaving. What happen...? - Please, can you just leave? No! What happened to your face? It's okay. It's okay. Hi, good afternoon. Thank you for coming. Yo! What happened to you? You disappeared. It's nothing. It's always nothing. - What do you want? - What do you mean what do I want? We had a business agreement. I am busy. Busy. Let me see this thing you have. What the hell is wrong with you? -Hi -Hi, good afternoon. - How are you? - Who did that to you? - It's none of your business. - Sarah, who did that to you? Can you just mind your business? What do you want? See? That's why I don't mix business with pleasure. That's your copy. It's half. So I spoke to Lara and she agreed to split the work into two magazines. Why bother? - What? - Why are you doing this? You're not my type you know. I'm never going to sleep with you. So you think I'm doing this because I want to sleep with you? You want me to believe that you're doing this out of the goodness of your heart? Save that for someone else. You're so full of yourself uhn? Fine girl! I wonder the kind of guys that you sleep with. ‪You should change them, you know? Can you just leave? Go! I will. But listen. Listen to me. Your designs, are nice. But you'll get there. Hey, hey. You're not my type. You will never be. Alright. I admire a girl that hustles to get her shit together. I like that. Please do me a favor. Do not allow your personal life to interfere with your business. Doesn't look good on you. Okay? The guy, the bastard that did this. The bastard that did this to you. Don't let him get away with it. So, what I want you to do is simple. Go by the ladder and look beautiful. That's it. Work it girl! That's it. Right there, right there. Mama Africa. I love this, I love this, I love this. Oh, man. That's it. Oh, no, no, no, no. Check this out. Oh, my goodness. - Oh, this is so cute. I love this. - Beautiful. - I love this one. - More of that. High five! Yeah. The one thing that you had to do is show up. So I'm like, How do you mean by I'm not your friend? I'm your friend. I got you the job. All you had to do was show up early and you were late. What do you expect me to do? Hey! Big bro. - Hi. - Hi. ‪-I was thinking... ‪-Uhn... You know... ‪What do you want to do... Like I... Oh! What did I do? Is this vodka in your cup? You are here to work. Vera, what's your problem? Are you on my set to misbehave? - Oww! I'm sorry. - Sorry for yourself. It was because you Fred lost his date. How is that my fault? Everything is your fault. I know how flirty you get when you're drunk. Because of that, you got wasted and Fred had to take you home. - Oh, that's not fair. - What's not fair? No, it's fine. There's nothing wrong with it. It's okay. - It's okay? - It's okay. Trust me. You're good. You're good. Hey. Hey. Hi. Can I talk to you for a minute, please? Oh yeah, of course you can. I'll just hold on to that. - I hate you. - I love you. What's up? I'm sorry about yesterday. Who did it? My ex-boyfriend. But I'm dealing with it. I see your cuts and bruises are gone. Makeup? Yeah, you know, makeup has been saving women since the 1990s. Hey, come here. Are you good? Really? No. Not really? But I'll be fine. Look, thank you for making this happen. I really needed it. You're welcome. So, do you still think I'm doing this because I want to sleep with you? ‪No. Listen, I'm really sorry about that. I've just been going through so much. There's just too many things going on. It's okay, I get it. Alright. If you need any help, just let me know. - Okay? - Thank you. Be comfortable. - I love your pieces by the way. - Thanks. Alright. Let's do this. - Alright, guys. Let's go. - Alright guys let's go. I need a drink. Let's make history. Let's go! Let's go. Yo! Keep the same energy guys. You look beautiful. I wish I could marry you all. Did you have a nice time? Yeah, I did. Yeah. And thank you for reaching out. Although I would have preferred this meeting in my office. I'm sorry. I'm sorry for stealing into your weekend. Why are you hiding? What's the problem? That's him. Oh, that's my friend. So... Okay, that's fine. What are you doing? Michael wait... Micheal. No! Wait. Don't do that. Micheal! Yo! Mehn! Yo! What the hell, mehn? Who is this fool? What the hell is wrong with you? Get away from Sarah. Who are you to tell me what to do? Sarah is mine. I'm not yours. Sarah. Stay away from me. - Sarah, wait. - Did you hear that? Mr Adeshola, I'm so sorry about that. No, no, no, no. We're done. Okay? We're finished. I can't be associated with animals like this. Call me animal one more time. Call me animal one more time and see what I will do to you. Say it. Sarah is mine. You hear that? Stay away from her. Animal! Animal! Mr Adeshola... Get the fuck out of here. Guy! Hey, Michael, what's up, mehn? What the hell, mehn? That guy is one of my biggest clients! How come you know Sarah? - You know Sarah? - Yes! How come you know Sarah? Oh!!! That's the girl you went out on a date with. Guy, you need to go after her now. Go! - Wait. Have you two-? - No, no, no, no. Just go after her mehn. Go! Michael, don't follow that guy. ‪Don't worry, I have his plate number. Go, guy, go! Sarah, come on. All of you should just leave me alone, please. - Sarah, look... - Just leave me alone. All of you should just leave me alone, ‪-please. ‪-Come on. Look, I understand, ‪I understand but at least ‪explain to me what's going on. - What's going on? - Yes. What's going on? You and Dare, are you not friends? Are you the reason why he knows where I live? What? Mr. Adeshola? Why would I tell him where you live? I didn't even know you both were friends. Sarah, come on, is that why you blocked all my calls? All of you guys are the same. You're the same! I saw you at the car park. You saw me at the car park. And? After our seemingly perfect date, I saw you, with that girl. Her hands were all over you. You guys were practically kissing. I'm sure for all I know, you went home with her that night. Oh God. That was Vera. Vera is my friend. In fact, she's my sister because she's Michael's sister. - Vera. - Yes. She was drunk and I couldn't just leave her like that, so I had to take her home. Look, I had a perfect evening. Come on. So even if it wasn't Vera. Even if it was some other girl. Why would I want to ruin such a perfect evening? I can't do this. - Sarah. - I can't do this. I'm sorry, I can't. I just can't do this. We can actually talk. Sarah. - Oh, good afternoon. - How are you? - I'm good. What are you doing here? - Well, Lara is my friend. I see you've moved up in the world. - She wouldn't work with just anyone. - It's all thanks to him. Michael? I told you, he's a good guy. - Yeah, but he's a bad guy. I remember. - Exactly! Now, don't underestimate your contribution to this. Yeah, I'm really happy with how they've used my designs. So why do you look unhappy? What are you talking about? - I'm sure this is everything for you. - Mm hmm. But you look unhappy. You have a beautiful smile. This. It's very obvious that it's fake. You know me too well. So what's the problem? Man troubles? Is it Michael? No, it's not Michael. It's someone else. Who? Tell me about him. Well, his name is Fred. We went out together once and I think I had a really good time. So what happened? Is he married? Did he cheat? No. - So what is it? - It's not that simple. It is that simple. We women tend to make things complicated. There's certain questions you need to ask. Do you like him? Does he like you? Can you see a future with him? Is it worth the time and energy? When you answer all those questions, then it becomes easy. Yeah. I mean, I still have a lot more question than that, though. Look, when I met Andy. I didn't want to be with him, because I felt like he was very... very boring and too uptight. But he made me happy the most, and still makes me happy till now. I mean, look at me, I'm high maintenance. But you absolutely love Andy, right? - As much as I can possibly love him. - Yeah. We love who we love and we marry who we marry. But we're lucky if it's the same person. So? What are you waiting for? Do you have a thing for Michael? No, definitely not Michael. It's... Take your time and make your own decision. Go with someone that that you're going to see yourself happy with for a very long time. A moment is only going to last for a moment. And that's what people fail to realize. But whatever you decide. Make sure it's for you and only you. - You got that? - Yeah. I'm proud of you. - Thank you. - So proud of you. - This is beautiful. - Thank you. Wow! Give me a moment, let me talk to her. - Okay. - Alright. ‪Hey girl. - Come here, look at you. - Oh my god. - Yeah. - Wow. Oh gee. Girls, come see. Hi Micheal! I give you the Michael Angelo of photos. Nice. - Please I'd like to get my photo. - You haven't even edited yet. - This is... I haven't touched yet. - It looks so good. - Hi, Sarah. - Hi. - Bye Sarah. - Bye. Okay, okay, okay. Okay guys. All you have to do is just stop on my store, remember I gave you the details. So stop by and then I'll sort you out. I'll give you a discount. ‪Okay. - Bye! See you. - Thank you. Bye bye Bye Micheal. ‪-So Mike... ‪-Bye. - Thank you so much. - You're welcome. ‪-I'll love to work with you next time. ‪-Sure, we'll make it happen. - Bye! - Wait for me guys! - Bye, guys. - Bye. Do you think you'll be able to give me a ride back to the estate? - Sure, Sure. - Yeah? Thanks. - Michael. - Hmm. Could you tell me about Fred? Why, what do you want to know? I don't know. Like... How long have you known him? What kind of guy is he? I've known Fred for, like, ever. There isn't much to say. Fred is generally a good guy. If he's such a good guy, then why is he friends with you? You know you were quite the asshole the first time we met. Oh, okay. I am an asshole, thank you very much. But... Fred calmed me down. Hmm. I'm calm now. Fred changed me. So I'm not just a ruffian. - I'm a ruffian with reputation. - Mm hmm. You're a ruffian either way. You can't take the thug out of the streets. I'm a thug and I know it. And ladies love a thug in a suit. Ask TI and Fifty. But seriously, Fred is a good human being. When I was still getting into trouble and chasing girls, Fred helped my sister get back into university. And when Gloria isn't in school She's doubling as his secretary, Even Vera says she wouldn't marry any guy that isn't like Fred. I think you're just saying this to make Fred sound good. Oh, it's the truth. You guys went out on a date, right? Did you enjoy it? It was the most fun that I've had in a very long time. Okay. I think he feels the same way, too. What did you guys even do, please? You charmed my friend, right? Well, whatever it is you've done. It's working because he can't stop thinking about you. Is he... Is he violent? Fred, rarely loses his temper. No, no, no, that's not what I mean. I mean, is he violent? Fred will never hit a woman. Never. How do you know? I know Fred. He's not a violent person, I can bet my life on it. And I think you know it too. ♪ Somebody knows it. ♪ - ♪ Her name is Sarah. ♪ - Michael. - ♪ Somebody knows it, her name is Sarah. ♪ - Michael. Okay, okay. I'm almost done. Oh my goodness. Are you ready? Glad you like it. Which one is your house? Cos they all look alike. This one here. Black gate on your right. Thank you. For what? For bringing me home. What else would I be thanking you for? I don't want your thank you. Take it back. - Wow! Wow! - Yes. Now she thanks me. Better late than never, right? Really? Alright! - Did you have a nice time, though? - I did, actually. Yeah. - Don't worry, I can take it. - I got it. - You know, I can do it. - I know you can. Alright, thank you. - Alright. - See you. Bye! Hold on. Are you busy? Not now. So I have a couple of more designs I would like for you to see. Maybe you and Lara would like them. - Okay, cool. - Come in. Alright. Can I park - properly? - No, just park over here. Yeah, that's fine. I'll wait for you right here. Alright. Do that. - Hurry up. I'm hot. - Are you kidding? - These are heavy. - Okay, okay. Alright. Alright. There you go. - Alright. - Since you want to do it. Let's do it. Do you have dogs? That's for me to know and for you to find out. No, no, no, no, no. I'm not a dog person. No. Micheal, you're supposed to be fearless remember. No, not dogs. But for real, do you have dogs? ‪No, Don't worry. - Great. - You're good. Let's do this. Welcome! - This is nice. - Thank you. Alright, So just give me a second and I'll be right... Move! Fucking bitch, move! I'm asking you again, move! What's going on? Get your tout out of here. Bitch! Move. Michael. Michael. Mike. Michael. Michael. Mike. Mike. What happened? Dare is in the kitchen. That fucking cockroach again? I have to go and get Kabiru. - Yeah. - Baby! I'm so happy you're okay. Please don't ever hurt me. Oh my goodness. Now, who is the prettiest woman here? My baby. You know, Elizabeth, you should take a picture of him. He's a photographer but he doesn't like taking pictures. - He's very shy. - Shut up, Fred. - Really? - Try. Take a picture of him. - No! - Stop. - Be careful. - Stop. So give it to me. And they call us the lovebirds! At least now he understands. - Yeah. - You look so good. ‪Subtitle translation by: Adefoluke Adebayo
