Hey sis, it's me. I got my plane ticket. I will be getting in first thing Saturday morning. And I wish you would have just let me pay to ship your car up here. Maybe you're right. Maybe this drive is just what you need right now. I, I saw that you deleted your Facebook account. I have no way of seeing that sweet face of yours. Raven, I know this is hard. I miss her too. Raven, hey, it's me. I'm so, so, so sorry, but there's been a change of plans. I got called to do ER duty this weekend and there is absolutely no one else that can do it. It has to be me. I'm so sorry. So, my girlfriend Jessica, she's gonna fly down there and she's gonna make the drive with you, okay. Look, I know, I know, I know what you're gonna say, but please, please give her a chance, please for me. Okay, I, I don't think that you should be doing this drive alone right now, okay. All right, I will see you soon. I love you. Stay strong, okay.

Tragic even. What? Relationships. I feel like some of the best ones end before they even get a chance to get started. Oh man, don't do that, okay. Not now. You're gonna make me lose it. We already packed the tissue. I'm just stating the obvious. Okay, we were on the road to becoming the best roommates ever. Ever in the history of roommatedom. I don't know, it's just sad I guess. It makes me feel bad. I can't help feeling bad about it. No one should feel bad about anything. But thanks. I think you're pretty great, too. I guess the saying is true. Blood is thicker than water. Or margaritas. I am going miss our margaritas. I'm gonna miss you too. Life's so random, isn't it? I mean people meet, relationships start and then just suddenly end. Bad shit happens, out of the fucking blue. It's like life's some cosmic joke. I mean I'm telling you God has got to be a woman because only a real bitch would do that shit to people's lives. Thank you. My pleasure, young lady. You enjoy that 900 mile drive back to New York now. Y'all be careful going down the road. Oh, we will. Raven? You must be Jessica. Hey, it's really nice to meet you. Oh, hi. Hi. Wow, you're so much prettier than Kyle said. Oh gosh, thanks. No, thank you. I mean it's really nice of you to do this. It means a lot. Yeah, it's okay, it's no problem. I know I'm a sorry substitute for your own brother, but everything was so last minute. No, not at all. I'm actually really glad that we're gonna get a chance to know each other. He's talked so much about you. Oh, yeah, me too. Well, there she is. She's all gassed up, packed up, ready to go. Oh, okay. Um, do you actually mind if we go inside for a minute? I was actually thinking that we'd just hit the road, you know? I want to beat the traffic. Well, of course. It was just sort of a long flight. Uh, I, I would but the house is already locked up and my only set of keys is in the kitchen for the landlord. Really? But you know we are gonna be on a road trip. I'm sure you can just pop a squat out back, you know? Oh, um, yeah, great. It's pretty private back there. I mean there is a neighbor on the second floor that I'm pretty sure was jerking off while I was sun bathing the other day, but you know. You serious? No, I mean it's fine. Like I'm sure he's not there now. Um, okay. This is embarrassing, but... It's fine, man, just you know, I'll be here waiting. Yeah. You ready? Yeah. Okay. Don't worry, we're gonna have a great time, I promise. Yeah, yes. So it's kind of cool you and Kyle are both in the medical field. You're a nurse, right? Medical tech. But I'm going for my RN, maybe nurse practitioner, I'm not really sure yet. Yeah, Kyle said they had some really good programs up by us. Listen, Jessica, don't feel like you have to make bullshit small talk with me, okay. You can relax. It's gonna be a long trip and I'm sure we'll get to know each other. Probably even more than you and Kyle do by the time we get to New York. So, how long have you been dating my brother? Almost a month. Get the fuck out. I thought this was way longer than that, I mean the way he talks about you. Yeah, a month this weekend actually. But we were talking online for a long time before that, so we really felt like we got to know each other really well before we, you know, actually met face to face. No, I get it. The whole love at first sight thing. It's so twentieth century. Shakespearean even. What century is that? What, like 16th? Yeah, something like that. So 16th century. It's cool though. I mean, when you know you know. When you meet the right person, it just kind of hits you in the guts, you know. I mean I got worried there for a minute. You know he was just banging bimbo after bimbo. I mean you should have seen some of these bitches that were coming through. Whoof. Head East on Mulberry Road Northwest. In two miles turn left onto Highway 53. In one mile turn left onto Highway 53. Shut the fuck up. Highway 53. You know in fact, We don't need that fucking thing. I mean I have this whole trip planned out anyway. We're gonna take back roads the whole way. I mean who wants to look at the fucking interstate anyway. Uh, what, what happens if we get lost though? I, don't you think it'd be better if we had that as a backup plan? Backup plan? A backup plan is for little bitches that need to call their daddy for every little thing that happens. I mean come on, where's your sense of adventure? I want to get lost a couple times. Hell, I mean the whole point of this thing is to have an experience, right. Don't worry, you'll be fine. I'll protect you. Like you're my own little baby sister. What? You. Me what? You're just not quite what I expected, that's all. What were you expecting? Uh, I don't know. Kyle said you were like, uh... What? Kyle said I was what? Well, not exactly the spontaneous type. Kind of like super organized and together. A little overly so. I think anal is the word he used. Anal, hmm. So what, you think I don't have my shit together. Is that what you're saying? Uh, no, I didn't, I didn't mean that. What, you think something's wrong with me? I'm surprised, I didn't realize you're so judgmental, Jessica. I don't. I'm not judging you. No, no, no, no, it's cool, it's cool. You think I'm fucking crazy, right? I'm crazy, whoo! Listen, I'm crazy, you're crazy, we're all gonna go fucking crazy on this trip, cause guess what, this is the crazy train and you can't get off now. I think I might've changed my mind. Take me back to the airport. I'm gonna run in and grab a tea. You want something? Grab me a few more energy drinks. Seriously? Better take it easy with those things. You going for some kind of record or something? Hey, gotta feed the monster in this bitch. Oh, sorry, double security locks. The previous owner had them installed. I think her mom had Alzheimer's or epilepsy or something. What's up? My phone. I thought I left it in here. Did you see it? No. Did you check your purse? Yes, I checked my fucking purse. What do you think, it's not in there. Okay, just chill. I'm sure it's in here somewhere. Did you check under the seat? Yeah, and it's not in between the seats either. Maybe I left it inside. Hey asshole, watch where you're going. Oh my god. Are you okay? Yeah, I think so. Hey look, there are worse things than losing your phone, right. Come on, let's go. I can't believe I lost my phone. I've never done that before. You've never lost your phone? Man, I've broken or lost at least like six of them by now. You seriously have never lost your phone before? Well, once, at a party in high school. Or it was stolen. I mean I was so wasted I wouldn't have known either way. The lightweight that I am. You're a lightweight? Man, I would have pegged you for a hardcore party girl for sure. Gosh, I haven't even talked to Kyle since I landed. Oh, seriously? Here let me fix that, hold on. Voicemail. Hey big bro, this is your adorable little sister and possibly even more adorable girlfriend just calling you from the road. I can see why you fell for her, she's delicious. Anyway, I'm sure you're stitching up some drunk's lacerated ass or calming down some overprotective parents whose kid has a head cold. But uh, we just wanted to let you know that everything's cool. Other than the fact that your airhead girlfriend lost her phone. I mean, I'm sure we'll find it. Don't worry about it. But anyway, until then just, uh, give me a call back on my phone and we will see you in a few days. All right, bye bro, we love you. Bye. I hope it wasn't presumptuous of me to say that you love him. No, I tell him that all the time. I'm his girlfriend. I mean it wasn't so cool calling me an airhead though. I was kidding. I mean obviously you're not an airhead. You're like some smart college girl, right? Come on, you are. What's your major? Well, I haven't declared, but I'm leaning toward psychology. Psychology, see. How smart do you have to be to study Freud and shit? I didn't mean it. You don't have to be so sensitive. Look, I'm really sorry, okay? I am. We friends? Are you gonna sit and sulk the whole time or you gonna like give me a smile? Come on. I thought we already figured this whole thing out. Yeah, okay. Great, good, I thought I lost you there for a minute. Sorry. Geez. Hey boys, how's it hanging? ♪ Called out King me asshole. ♪ Crumble ♪ In your wake I might need you to take over for me in a little bit here. Oh, no problem. Just let me know when. Why don't you see if you can get something on that shitbox. Y'all don't forget the swap meet and antique auction is goin' on this Saturday. It's the event of the season, so don't snooze and lose on it. Go out and get yourself some. Here's a little number from Flappy Mitchell's Flatbed Rangers, right here for you. Aw, fuck me. Were were going sixty, right? I mean how fast is the speed limit here? Look, it's no big deal. It's okay. License, registration and insurance please. Sure. Why did you not immediately pull over at the sound of my siren? I was just a bit confused. I'm not from here. Did I have a tail light out or something? I'll ask the questions if you don't mind, miss. Can you provide your license, registration and insurance, please? Sure. It was a long time ago. I used to experiment with different hair colors. Don't you? Registration? I think it's in the glove compartment. Can you check? Slowly. Hands where I can see them. I don't see it. Are you sure it's in here? Yeah, I think so. Officer, are you gonna tell us why you pulled us over? You were traveling at an excessive speed. This is a 45 mile per hour zone. You were going 70. 71 to be exact. 45? It's 60 down this whole highway. I didn't see a sign. There is a sign clearly marked three quarters of a mile back. What, tucked behind a rock or painted on a pig? Miss, shut the glove compartment and step out of the vehicle. What? Step out of the vehicle, both of you, now. Take a seat right down there between the cars. You trying to look up our shorts or something? Miss, if you don't shut up, I will place you under arrest. Am I gonna have to go to court for this? You were traveling at 26 miles per hour over the speed limit. You'll be expected back here for court on the assigned date. No, no, please no. I'm on my way to New York, I'm moving there to be with my brother. Our mom died just very recently. And this is his girlfriend, and she's helping me make the drive. And please, officer, please, you can't make me come back here, I can't. You have to understand, I can't come back here. Miss, there's no need to get upset. Please, officer, please. I can't come back here. Shit heel. What? He did let us go, he didn't have to. Yeah, but he's just gonna unleash on the next unsuspecting motherfucker. He'll just climb right back up in his little deer blind and just pick them off one by one. No, I think he really felt for you. Yeah, and I think he really felt something for you in his pants. No, I mean it. When you started crying, I could see it in his eyes. His face just turned. You really got to the poor guy. You just wanna believe the best about everybody, don't you? Everything's just fucking unicorns and rainbows for you. Hey, Raven? What? I can't imagine what you're going through, I know. But I'm really sorry about your mom. Thanks. Look, I'm sorry about, about what I said about the unicorns and rainbows thing. I don't know that about you. That's okay. But I bet you did have them on your lunch box or your backpack. My book bag, yeah. And sunflowers. Oh, the sunflowers, how could I forget the sunflowers? You feel better? You slept pretty hard. Yeah, thanks for uh, taking over. You like the car? She drives nice, huh? Yeah, it does. Real smooth for a small sedan, I like it. Done so much in this car, I feel like, I don't know, it's just like it becomes part of you, you know? Just did a lot of crazy shit. That wouldn't have anything to do with boys, would it? It does kind of have a small backseat. I can't lie and say that I haven't utilized it from time to time. But no, I wasn't talking about boys. But you seem to know quite a bit about spending some time in the backseat with a few boys. What? No. I'm a one guy kind of girl. I don't give it up easy. Kyle is quit the catch, isn't he? Yeah, he is. Kyle's the best. Yeah, my brother's great. He's one in a million. You bored, you look bored. No, no, I'm good. I'm just taking it all in. It's really pretty down here. You know I thought I would be bored but I'm really not. Okay, so you're bored shitless. Why don't we play an old fashioned driving game? A driving game? What, you mean like the ones you play with your family on long trips as a kid? Fighting with your brother and sister the whole way and bad body odor all around. Those kind of games? Yeah, those kind of games. It could be fun. A good way to kill the time. I didn't think you were the driving game type. I'm just full of surprises, just wait and see. Come on, pick one. Um, oh God, okay, how about I spy? I spy? Yeah, I spy. You know, I spy with my little eye, and then you have to give a hint about something that you see and the other person guesses what it is. What, really? I spy is like the oldest driving game ever. I'm pretty sure the settlers used to play it. I spy with my little eye, hmm, something tall and brown and leafy. Oh no, here, I've got another one for you. I spy with my little eye, something dead, bloody and covered in maggots and splattered all over the road. Okay, I don't know. Look, we can't play license plates. That would kind of be hard. You ever play hot seat? Hot seat? Yeah, it's fun. It's like, uh, truth or dare, but more intense, more rapid fire. I don't know, we're not 13. Come on, it's a great way to get to know each other. Get a glimpse into each other's character. I mean, come on, you're studying psychology. This should be right up your alley. I mean unless, you know, you have something to hide. I mean I thought that, you know, we're friends here. Didn't have anything to hide from each other. Okay, how do we play? All right, one person is in the hot seat and the other person gets to ask five questions. Anything you want. It can be as mundane as, I don't know, what was your first pet? To Something really, really personal. And the only thing that you have to answer the question or you get a little smack. What do you mean a smack? Just like a little smack. No. Oh come on, it's like a love tap. I'll even go first. Ask me anything you want. What's your heart's desire? Shoot. Hmm, I don't know, give me an example. Uh, did you ever cheat on a test in high school? Oh, okay, so we're doing like gloves off kind of stuff. Well yeah, obviously gloves off. Especially when it comes to the smacking. Haha. Okay, let's do it. You're in the hot seat? Yes, question one. Shoot. Okay. What was your first pet? Very imaginative. Uh, it was a parakeet, named Jemima. Next question. What was the worst job you ever had? You're really cutting me deep here, Jessica. Oh, okay, hold on. I'm building up. Alright, um, the worst job I ever had. Picking up trash on the side of the road. That was a job? Think about it more like a volunteer opportunity. It was only one afternoon but it felt like forever. You wouldn't believe some of the shit that people throw out of their car windows. I mean, half eaten bags of fast food, used condoms. It's disgusting, I even found a dead bird. Okay, ew, I've heard enough, no more. Wait, was it Jemima? No, it wasn't Jemima. Now ask the next goddamn question, come on. Okay. Mmm, how old were you when you had your first kiss? Nine. Nine? Yeah, nine. Okay. Next question. Have you ever wished you could be somebody else? Why would I want to be somebody else? What, seriously, you've never wished you could ever be anybody else, even for a day? No, why would I? What, okay, that's it, I'm giving you a smack. I thought you had to answer honestly or else you get a smack. You're getting one. Come on, every little girl dreams of being somebody else. Fine, fine. Oprah. You are full of it! Oh my gosh, Oprah? What? Okay, I'll let it slide, this time. Last question, let's go. Okay, okay, last question. Last question in the hot seat. The big one. You ready? I'm just dying of anticipation. Okay. Who was the greatest love of your life? Nah. I'm not gonna answer that. No, actually rather I choose not to answer that. It's my prerogative. Okay, come on, spill it. What do I care. No, just give me a smack, come on. I don't want to smack you. Jessica, those are the rules. Smack me. I said I'm not gonna smack you. Jessica, just shut up and fucking smack me, come on. Okay. You're kidding, right? What? No, what do you want? Are you gonna slap me for real or you just gonna give me like that little pussy bullshit again? Come on. Fine. Ooh, she's got a little fire in her. Thank God, I was starting to worry. Sorry, you asked for it. There you go, that's the game. You ready? Your turn. Okay. All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're asking Jessica her first question here. Did you vote in the last election? Uh, sorry couldn't quite hear ya, uh, we're gonna need a verbal answer. No, okay. No, I didn't. Not the last one. Wow. All right. I'm, I feel so enlightened now. I mean now I know why the world has gone to shit. You know, you're not participating... Stop. Listen, I get it. I respect that you are a woman of conviction. But you know, just don't really care what happens to the world. I do, too. All right, fine. Um, what was the most embarrassing thing that ever happened to you as a kid? I tooted. I'm sorry, did you just say you tooted? Yeah, I tooted. I farted, in class. That's it? What, no this was no ordinary fart. I was in the third grade and I was leaning up against my desk with my butt in the air, you know. And somebody said something funny and it just bursted out of me. It sounded like a popgun. And then all the kids stared at me and started laughing, including the teacher, Mrs. Folk. I must have turned a hundred shades of red. I mean, I guess that's pretty bad for a third grader. Okay, third question. Are you gonna ask or what? Umm, how many guys have you slept with, more or less than six? Less! Definitely less. All right, we've got a virtuous one here. I mean, albeit politically lazy but virtuous. All right, what's your favorite position with my brother Kyle? What, what, what? No, no I'm not telling you that. You have to answer. No. Those are the rules, Jessica. Give me your arm. Ow! What the fuck? Sorry, I didn't realize that I hit you that hard. You okay? Fine, I have one more question and then you're done. Have you ever wanted to kill somebody? Yeah. You right about now. See, I told you you'd love this game. No, I definitely did not. I never want to play it again. Come on, you love it. No, it was terrible. The worst. Did I win? It's not about winning.

What if those guys come back? I mean you really didn't say anything to the motel manager. Yeah, but they don't know that. Plus if they do, they'll be sorry. Let's call Kyle, remember. I already tried him, no answer. Hmm, when I was in the shower, why would you do that? Well call him back. No answer. Sorry. Well let me try. I just told you there was no answer. Well just let me. No. Give it. Come on, what's the point? Raven, stop. I told you that there was no answer - I want to talk to Kyle, please. Just give it to me. Are you kidding here? No. Just please let me call him. No. Please. Okay, go for it. Uh, that's weird. It's not going to his voicemail. Well, maybe you hit a different number on the keypad. It happens. This is Kyle Richards. Sorry I can't take your call right now. If you know me, you know I'm busy saving and preserving life. Please leave a message and I'll get back to you just as soon as I can. Hi, baby, it's me. I guess you're working. Or I know you're working or else you would have picked up. Or I would be waking you up which would be so rude with you working so hard. Anyway, everything's going fine. For the most part. Nothing to worry about. I just wanted to hear your voice. I miss you. I love you. Bye. Like I said, no answer. So I got his voicemail. Do you have his number in there twice? Is one of them old? I don't know, maybe you just hit the wrong button. It's bad. I'm sorry. We need to notify a supervisor and get detectives out here. Why did you do that last night? What? You know what. Save our asses? Get that guy to hit on me. Who does something like that? We were drunk, I was just having a little fun. Is that what it was, you were having fun? No, it, you want me to be honest? Yeah, I do, I do, I want you to be honest. I was testing you. Testing me, testing what? I wanted to see if you were worthy of my brother. To see if you really deserved him. I wanted to see what you would do when some guy really wants you. I mean really wants you. I'm gonna have to make sure you're not some dumb slut who gets drunk and gives it up to the first guy that tells her she's pretty. Who's living in some bullshit delusion that if she fucks some guy that he actually cares about her. If you want me to be honest, that's what I wanted to know. Don't worry, you passed. Now let's get the fuck out of here because I'm famished. Want to get some biscuits and gravy. You know, the kind of food that really sticks to your ribs. Pretty good, huh? These out of the way Podunk towns have the best fucking food. Better than sex. And it definitely lasts longer at least. Is it good enough to pay for or are we gonna dine and dash again? Oh, look at you, so funny. Well your sense of humor's definitely improving, I gotta give you that one. I gotta piss, I'll be right back. Just a little game we play. Stupid girl stuff, you know? Not eating off the floor now, are you? I mean this place is good and everything, but... Uh, no. Good luck. Thought we could use it. You ready to go? Yeah, sure. Whenever you are. I got this. Oh, thanks, how sweet. I'll meet you in the car. You got any ID? I think I'm gonna go lie down in the back. Why don't you just put your seat back? No, it's too bright up here, I can't sleep. You wanna watch my stuff back there? What the fuck? Excuse me, do you know where highway 301 is? The 301 north, I, I think it's around here someplace. Do you know where that is? I'm sorry, I don't know where no highway 301 is. So you live around here and you have no idea where highway 301 is? I don't know what you want me to say. I don't want you to say anything. You know what I want you to do? I want you to go home and fuck your mother some more, you fucking hick. Jessica. Jessica, where in the hell are you? Please call me back. My God, they found her in her house. She's dead. She's dead. My sister is dead. Please, please call me. I don't know who in the hell you're with, but please call me. Sir! Open the door! Hello! Hello! Help me! You done sleeping? Can you take over for a while? Sure. All right, scoot. Go on. Okay. You okay, you seem tense? Yeah, um, I, I, I think I got a kink in my neck or something from lying in back. See, I told you not to do that. Just relax. Man, I can feel it. See, we can just get all of that tension right out of there. You know I forgot to tell you, I have great news, I found your phone. You must have been in the restroom or something, I don't know where I found it, but. The funny thing is that I put it in my purse. And when I went to give it to you, it wasn't there. Isn't that funny? I thought it was really funny. You want to know what I think is really fucking hilarious though? That you are supposed to be the smart girl, psychology major. But it seems like I can read you a whole lot better than you can read me. You know your poker face is for shit, right? Oh no, no, don't even think about it. See then, you'd fuck up that pretty little face of yours, and then you'd fuck up my car. And then where would we be, right? So what now? Well, we have two options. You want to go and see Kyle, right? Make it back to New York? I was thinking that we could all get together and have a nice little chat. You know, like mature adults. Like how grown-ups do. So there's that or there's the other option, but I really don't think that you're gonna like that one. We still have a long ways to go. What, are we gonna play hot seat some more? Wow. You got a set of balls on you, girl. Okay, fine, how about this? You can ask me any question you like. Go ahead, shoot. What did you do? What did you do to Kyle's sister? Oh, I don't think that you want to know about that. All the gory details. I wouldn't want to offend your delicate sensibilities. Trust me. Who are you then? Who are you really, Jade? How do you know my name? I asked you a fucking question! How the fuck do you know my name? Where did you get this? In between the seats. You must have dropped it. I must have. Silly me. I'm always losing things. You know I, I always hated this picture. But Kyle loved it. He said I was the most beautiful woman in the entire world. He'd tell me all the time while he was fucking me. How much he loved me. I knew him long before you did, sweetie pie. I mean, how do you think we met? Do you like to shoot guns, Jessica? I, I never really liked them before. But I went to the firing range and popped off a couple shots, and I have to say, it's pretty easy. Not my favorite way to kill people though. It's just too fast, you know, it's just bang and then you're dead. I'd much prefer to really get to know somebody, you know. Find out every little thing about them, you know. Just really get to know them, from the inside out. So Jess, big question. Do you like our little game? I feel like we're really getting to know each other now. Don't you think? You know all about me. I already know everything about you to know. I've known girls like you my entire life. The pretty girls, the smart ones who, you know, everything was just handed to you. Adored by daddy. And all the boys just come running as soon as you bat your little fucking eyelashes. I mean basically like they're handing you their dicks on a platter. It's incredible though really. Ooh, what do you need, honey? Can we do anything for you? Oh no, no, don't bother yourself, I'll get it. Oh, here, honey, let me wipe your ass for you. Sound familiar? Am I on the right track? No. What was that, I couldn't hear. No, you're fucking not! You don't know me. You don't know anything about me. Adored by daddy? Yeah, until he died when I was ten. And let's just say mom couldn't find a suitable replacement. But there were men around, there were plenty of men. So don't sit there and tell me I had it easy. I mean you can do anything you want, you have the fucking gun, but don't think for a minute you know anything about me. You're right, Jess. I do have the gun, which means that we're gonna play by my rules, okay. So you can sit there all you want and tell me about your sad stories about how mommy was a whore and daddy died, but the truth is I don't really give a shit. Don't think about getting brave on me, sweetie. As much as I'd like to tear you open, I'll shoot you so fast you won't know what hit you. Then you can't go home to Kyle. Can't have that little chat like grown-ups now, can we? So you're gonna be a good girl and listen to everything I have to say. Got it? I want to hear you say that you understand. I understand. That's a good girl. Stop the car. I said stop the fucking car. Now this is what we're gonna do. I'm gonna let him in. And if you try anything or I hear a word out of you, I'll shoot that tight little pussy of yours off, okay. Get in! Let's go. Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. Oh, you are angels, both of you. You wouldn't believe the luck I'm having today. You wouldn't believe it. It's like somebody put a voodoo curse on me or something. That bad? It couldn't be worse. What are you late for the prom? My buddy's wedding. I'm the best man. Well it looks like you don't have the best car. Tell me about it. Anyway, two days ago my buddy tells me he's getting married. Two days and he wants me to be his best man. So where is the blessed occasion? Hartford. I knew my transmission was on the fritz. One wrong turn and then boom I'm stuck out in the middle of nowhere. On top of that, I'm in such a hurry I forget my freaking phone charger. Now my car is dead, my phone is dead, and I am stuck in the middle of nowhere with people zooming by me, laughing their asses off at me. Can you believe that? It definitely hasn't been your day. Listen, I just need to get to the next town, all right. Somewhere where I can rent a car. Or somewhere where I can at least get a cab to a place where I can rent one. Thank God there are still two decent people in the world like you two. This is all pretty out of the, all of a sudden, huh? Just caught in the middle of everything. Yeah, yeah, I'm caught in the middle all right. Or the ass end. I don't even know which. So how long did this friend of yours know this girl? Not long. A few months, maybe. He met her on a cruise. You know it's so funny, we were just talking about a friend of ours who just shacked up with this guy out of nowhere. Weren't we? Yeah, apparently he's all goo goo gaga for her. You know, madly in love. The whole deal. And we just kept telling her, what a stupid bitch you are to fall for a guy. I mean, she doesn't even know the guy. Right, how can you get to know somebody like that so quickly? You can't. Yeah, yeah, I don't know, I, uh. So we're like, you stupid little cunt. You're gonna get hurt. Like I'm talking full-on devastated, your ass will never be the same again hurt. And you're gonna deserve it. I mean whatever happens to you, you're gonna deserve it. Right? Yeah, I don't know, maybe you're being a little hard on your friend. So you guys from Georgia? Saw the plates when I was getting in. You guys moving? Where you headed to? Stop the car. What? I said stop the car! Get out. Don't move. Get out. Did you see what you made me do? You made me kill the best man. Oh, come on, not in the car. I can't tell you where we are, Kyle, okay, I can't. You have to understand what I'm doing. I'm doing this for us, I'm doing it so it can go back to the way it was. No, you don't understand. She's the one that did this. She poisoned your mind against me, I know it was her. She did all of this. To us, to me, and I have to fix it. I'm just trying to fix it, don't you understand? No, Kyle, no, you can't say that to me! No, no. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean it, I'm sorry. Listen, I'm gonna fix it and everything's gonna be okay. She is the one that came between us. She is the one that did all of this. She is the one that killed Raven. It's her fault. I didn't want it to happen, I didn't want to have to do that, but she made me. She did all of this. No. No, don't say that. Now listen, you don't understand, it's okay. I know that you don't right now, but you will. I love you. Pretty little Jessica. You knew this had to happen. You poisoned him against me. And he just doesn't understand right now, but he will. He's gonna see that pretty little face and that pretty little bod of yours sliced open. I'm not usually one for vengeance, Jess, but when you take something that isn't yours you need to be punished. So I was thinking that we could play your favorite game. Hot seat. Except this time, if you don't answer one of my questions, I get to slice open a different body part. What do you think? First I'll cut over here, and watch you bleed out a little bit. And then all across your stomach and your sides. I'll cut out your heart, so you know what it feels like to have it ripped out, and taken away from you. I bet your insides are pretty. Just like you. Now you stay here, I'll be right back. Aw Jess, you're making this way too easy. You know I like to play with my food before I eat it. No, stop. Stop. No. Oh, oh. What, are you gonna shoot me? Fucking bitch! Who do you think you are? Who the fuck do you think you are? You think no one else has felt pain? You think you're fucking special? What gives you the right? Come in. Hey, how are you? I'm fine, um, just a little tired. Made some tea, do you want any? Oh no, I'm good. Just catching up on some reading. I'm probably going to bed soon. Well let us know if you need anything, okay? Hey, Jen, thanks for letting me stay here a while. I really appreciate it. Do you want us to shut the door? Oh no, I'm good. Life's so random, isn't it? I mean people meet, relationships start and then just suddenly end. Bad shit happens, out of the fucking blue. It's like life's some cosmic joke. I mean I'm telling you God has got to be a woman because only a real bitch would do that shit to people's lives. Well, this isn't random. It's necessary. And you know that, and I know it. We both know it. Well listen, maybe, you know, we'll get a chance to be best friends in another life. You never know. Cheers to that. Here's to another life.
