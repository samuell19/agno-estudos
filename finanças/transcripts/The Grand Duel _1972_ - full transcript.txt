Hey, driver, can't you put the fear of God into those mules of yours? I'd give anything for a bath. You just don't worry about a thing, honey. We'll be there in a minute. Whoa! Whoa! You lousy dirty...! You low-down...! And you can't even shoot straight. I'll... Bighorse, is that you? No, I'm Abe Lincoln and this is a wheelbarrow, you dumb so-and-so. It ain't safe to go into town. A murderer escaped from jail down in Jefferson. Seems he's hiding out around here somewheres. The vultures already gathered. He's got 3,000 dollars on his head. You don't think we could get as far as the saloon, do you? Nobody wants to work out in the west at all. It's all killing and drinking and playing poker. If you'll allow me, I'll... You better stay where you are and don't let nobody get out. Party could start any time now. The man said that nobody was to get out. I'm thirsty. Hey, you! Stop where you are and put your hands up! I mean it, mister. You wanna get yourself killed or something? - Hey, driver... - Shh. Let him go, Bill. He's just another one of them vultures. Let him go, I said. Gee, I thought we was meant to be stopping people. You'd better stay under cover there now, sweetheart. - Where are you going now? - Take it easy, nipper, or I'll think you're out for the bounty too. - Can't you read? - I'm thirsty. I've already lost an eye in a gunfight. Then use the other one to find a thirsty man some whiskey, friend. Why don't you get us some grub and some whiskey? And a rinse-off for the ladies. Better make yourselves comfortable, folks. I know these ambushes, yes, siree. Once in El Paso I waited three days and three nights. Someone spread word that Jesse the Kid was holed up there. Well, there was 10,000 in silver on old Jesse's head. That was good dollars in those days. Must been at least 20 of them waiting for him, a gun in every corner. Nobody wanted to leave. They figured that if he was there, sooner or later he'd have to show. Yep. Three days and three nights. Well? Was he? Seems so. Only he was sitting in the corner pretending to wait along with the rest of them. How about a piece of that cake? Without the filling. Oh, I'll bring the bottle too. Can't you settle down? Settle down, yeah. Son of a gun, you're shooting at me? Philip Vermeer, we got you trapped! Philip Vermeer... ...you're under arrest. Yeah? Maybe you're gonna die. You might have had a chance, but your gun's empty. You get on out here and you won't get hurt. What brings you this way, Sheriff? I didn't think I was so important. All we are after is the reward! If you come out now, we'll forget the poster says you're worth the same dead as you are on the hook. We'll make an honest try to take you into Jefferson alive. Sure you will. We don't wanna kill you. Come out with your hands up! Well, aren't you gonna let 'em have me, eh? Justice will be done. By bounty hunters. I'm the one who's doing the hunting, Sheriff. Ain't nobody gonna touch a hair on your head. I'll guarantee that. Me, Holk! They'll kill you too, just to collect the bounty. You got ten seconds, Philip Vermeer. Throw out your gun and gun belt. Do what he says. Five seconds. All this for a measly... 3,000 dollars. I'm coming out. If I'm not mistaken, a sheriff can't collect the bounty from the bandits he kills. I never kill for money. Get outta the way, Sheriff. You leave him to us! It's a month or more we've been after his hide. He's ours! Well, I'm sorry. Possession is nine points of the law. I can't take him on the stage like this. I need two horses. I ain't wanting to obstruct the course ofjustice... ...but I know you for what you are, mister. Since you got off of that stage, you've been after the reward on his head like the rest of us. Now you're turning into a bastard with a star on his chest, just so you can screw us out of 3,000 dollars. Maybe. I still need two horses. It's no fun riding along with a stiff. Besides, now the man's dead, he ain't worth much to you. Leave him here. Take the news to Jefferson. Then we'll bury him and everybody will be happy. Be the first time a coyote wanted a body just so he could bury it. Get under cover! This bastard ain't worth a nickel. Leave him to me. You know money is the root of all evil. Filthy goddammit! You're letting him get away. Get the horses! Whoa! Whoa! - There! - Hey, hey! Hold it now, darn it! Gila Bend, folks. Allow me, madam. I mean ma'am. Thank you. Miss... Oh, darn it, where did he go? There he is! Turn back! Turn back! Holk, it was you saying go on up there! - We'll get him around the next bend. - Sure. That's what you said before! Hold! Hold! One of them Indian tricks. He's under that horse or something. Got a hidey-hole around somewhere, I'll bet you. This here is about the only hole I see. Take an awful small Indian to pull a trick like that. You keep your eyes open, you hear? The road to Silverbell ain't safe at all. And that's why I need 5 dollars extra. Here. It was in Mexico, in the middle of the desert and I had one of these right under my butt. Three days and three nights surrounded by bandits who wanted that box. How did it end up? Never found out. They wanted the gold, not me. What d'you mean? You didn't let them just take it, for God's sake? Of course! For a lousy 50 bucks a month I'm supposed to sit up there and get my head shot off? Oh! Boys, take the strongbox back to the bank! Hey, you! Give me back my money! Mister, you just bought 5 dollars' worth of weak whiskey. Here. Belongs to one of them there bounty hunters. I ain't never seen the likes of them around here before. Sure hope we don't see 'em no more. Say that again. That's a Saxon brand. I've seen it on their horses too. Well, if the horses don't break a leg and if the wheels hold out and the weather stays good and we don't meet up with any bandits and if we take the main road, we'll be in Silverbell in five, seven, eight hours. We're going across the desert. But we'll die of thirst. There's the horses and the women. - It'll be night. - I find travelling by stage very uncivil. You're wasting time. Ha! Ha! - Stop! - Whoa! - Hey, stop! - Whoa! My horse died. Can you give me a ride? I ain't no bandit. Climb aboard, kid. Climb aboard. Well, you heard what the Marshal said. Move inside, sonny. You say that was...? Well, come on! I wanna go to Saxon City. Come on! Keep talking and you won't go nowhere. Ha! But isn't he's the one who...? Sheriff, will you tell us who he is? Somebody. Why don't you make the introduction, Sheriff? Why don't you? Philip Vermeer, jailbird, condemned to death, wanted for murder. The United States Government will pay 3,000 dollars to whoever... cuts my throat. Since you are forcing us to travel with a rogue, couldn't you tie his hands? Don't worry, ma'am. I only kill nice people. - Oh, Bighorse! Wie geht's? - Whoa! You wouldn't believe how happy I am to see you. - I see they ain't run you down yet. - Here, I'll give you a little kiss, just right on your... nose. Silverbell! Eat, sleep and toilet facilities. We were just about to heat up a little stew. Come on in, I'll give you something to eat. Three ladies, so watch your language. Three ladies, huh? Guten Abend, ladies! Eins, zwei, drei... Oh, that's a nice one there. Er... mister, mister, could you tell me where the...? Oh, you mean the...? Ja, ja, it's here. - In the stable? - What's wrong with the stable? Look, it's big enough for five horses. Did you really kill a man? What difference does it make? You don't look like a murderer. And you don't look like a busybody. Ach, now I know! You are Philip Vermeer and you are the one that killed old Patriarch Saxon and your father was a prospector and old man Saxon had him killed, like he had a lot of other people too. Und I say it's high time that someone put an end to... Go see to your stew, see if it's ready. Go see to your stew. Oh, the stew, ja, the stew. I had a little money set aside so I went into business with my American cousin. There's virtually no risk and no lack of clients either. - What do you do? - We opened a funeral parlor. We charge a minimum of 20 dollars and only cater for the best people. Well, the higher the price, the better the goods. That's my motto. Stick to stiffs. That should be yours. Pairs. Very good. Very good. - Oh, my God. Was ist los? - The stew ain't bad at all. I wonder if I'm gonna get a chance to eat another meal like this. Keine Angst. It was not loaded, Sheriff. I have the sense enough, ja, up here to empty a gun before I hang it on the wall. Never consider a gun empty. Ja, ja, never can consider that. Do you wanna play cards? You haven't got anything left to lose. Then why have you been following me? You know why old man Saxon had my father killed? He found silver on the other side of the mountains. Cards. I'll play these. So will I. My head's worth 3,000 dollars. That's my stake. Then there's no point in raising. Three queens. Three kings. You lose, Sheriff, and I'm leaving. Philip, sit down. If you wanna go to Saxon City, I'll take you there. Hey, Holk. Let's get 'em boxed in and stop 'em escaping. We better wait until dawn. - It's occupied. - Fine by me. Got you. The other one next. Turning into a real party, ain't it? Procreating faster than fleas on a bitch. 3,000 bucks is good any way you look at it. Thing I can't figure, though, if you divide 3,000 by seven, what's that each? You disappoint me, Sheriff. Easy as taking candy from a baby. Shh. Do you wanna wake 'em all up? They're tired. We got a long way to travel tomorrow. I'm leaving now and so are you, mister. You're coming with me. Do you know how old I am, Philip? Who gives a damn? Get up! You think I'd be still alive if I fooled around with kids who like to play with guns? Just get up, Clayton! It's not loaded. You said never consider a gun empty. No! If you move that I'll get some target practice. That's only good for making noise. Take cover! Maybe somebody else has already done the job for us. Better go easy, though. It could be an ambush. Never consider a gun empty. Here... Put these on. We need some sleep. Don't open that. I told you. Clayton! Send Philip Vermeer out here. As soon as we got him, we'll pull out! You ain't got no right to hold him. They took your star away when they ran you out of Jefferson. Unemployed, eh? Or did you change your job? You are losing. Come on out. Ain't no need to risk your life for a murderer and a phony sheriff. Is any of that the truth, what he said about you? Maybe. Let's get outside. I'm beginning to smell a stink around here. Come along, Anita. Ich bin mit dir, Sheriff. Now it's loaded, ja. Thanks for the moral support. Don't shoot, please don't! We are women and children. Come out with your hands up! Anita, hands up, child. All right, over to your right and huddle in close. Come on, move it. You destroyed my stagecoach, you lousy buzzards! You looking for a bullet, loud mouth? Of course I ain't looking for no bullet. I'll give you all of 30 seconds to step outside. After that we start shooting! Only gave us ten the last time. Do I go outside like this or are you gonna take 'em off? Time's running out! And we ain't gonna fall for no double-cross this time, Clayton. Even if he's guilty you can't let them do it. He's not guilty. He's stubborn. As long as I am about to die, would you like to tell me what you know and why you followed me? There's a lot of people following you. As a bounty hunter you sure ain't convincing. I saw who killed old man Saxon. Who was it? Who? I said I saw who did it, not that I'd tell you who he was. You should have told that to that court in Jefferson. And maybe testify against the son of a patriarch? Why should I have defended you? You wouldn't even defend yourself. You ready, boys? You go out that door, I doubt if you'll ever find out. Hold your fire, I'm coming out! He wouldn't get away with this if I was a sheriff. It wasn't easy to smoke you out, friend. We're gonna take real good care of you now. Here. Ha! Those lousy... Those sons of...! Have you had enough to drink yet? Are you ready to talk? No, I ain't saying a word to nobody! Pull him up! I needed to take me a bath. I sure do thank you, guys. You like it, huh? Huh? Yeah, catching double pneumonia ain't as bad as it sounds. Let him go! The Patriarch's sons will get it out of you. Better just tell us where that silver is or I'll pull you up and leave you here! Go to hell! Try and get it into that thick brain of yours that what we want is the silver. I'll guarantee you a fair share if you tell us where it is. Tell us where it is, you dumb bastard. You're being awful foolish, kid. You keep hitting him in the mouth, he won't be able to talk. Why don't you mind your own business? You've got a strange way of saying thanks. Thanks? I was just questioning them. Wait! Vermeer! I swear to God I'll see you both dead! I'm gonna get to town looking like a drowned rat. You'll be lucky to get anywhere. I don't see why if you give me a ride on your horse. When you want. I'm going back to Jefferson. Forget the ride. I'll just take the horse. I'm going north, to Saxon City. Oh, that's great. It's a nice place. The cemetery is on the sunny side of the hill. Yeah, and there's silver on the sunny side of the hill too. And I've got plenty of guardian angels. Don't push your luck too hard. Even guardian angels get tired. Yeah, especially if they've gotta walk 20 miles. Be seeing you. Meet you over at the saloon. I gotta talk to the Marshal. Out of the away, you old fart! Let go of me! Drink up, gramps! Don't forget, you're just an old idiot without a cent. You running-mouth old fool, tell us which wagon was yours. Where's all the rest of the things you gambled away? Too bad you don't have a pretty young wife. You'd lose her too. Hold it, Bull. Killing him ain't gonna change a damn thing! Somebody has gotta stop the Saxons from doing what they're doing before it's too damn late! One day you bastard Saxons are all gonna die, you hear? You too in there. I spit on you, Adam Saxon. You're the worst of the whole murdering lot but I ain't afraid of you Saxons. I ain't afraid to tell you what I think of you, you pockmarked coyote. Ah, there you are, the yellow-bellied murdering son of a yellow-bellied murdering patriarch. Yeah, a whole darn family of lily-livered, infected prairie dogs! But you'll get your comeuppance one of these days. Do you hear? And I'll spit on your faces and bury you, like I spit on your father when they buried him. Yeah. What do you say? Someone is gonna... Gonna... Hey, what are you doing? Are we fighting? No, don't shoot, Mr. Saxon. You wouldn't kill an old man like me, would you? I ain't no gunfighter, mister. Now, wait a minute. You can't shoot a defenseless old man. You can't. No, Mr. Saxon. No! Listen, Mr. Saxon... I ain't shot my old gun for years. I don't even know if it works. I'm too old to pull a gun. I'm out of practice. Listen, I wanna apologize for what I said. I'm sorry, Mr. Saxon. No! You murdering bastard! I ought to put a bullet in you! Leave me alone, damn it! Who decides now if this is murder or not? You? Your brother, the Marshal? Or David, that other coyote? I won his wagon at poker. You know the rest. It was a clear case of self-defense. Yeah, sure, and old John was pretty darn fast, wasn't he? Men are all different but guns are all the same. Ten to one pink shirt over there will be next. Adam Saxon. Old John's blood, five bucks it won't wash out. Philip! Just a moment, friends. I got something personal to take care of. What do you want, Philip? I want a little talk with you, Poxy. And with your brother, Eli. - And with David. - Whenever you want. My brother Eli is in his office. Our talk won't take long. Come on, walk! I didn't want you to let him get away. I only wanted you to make him talk before you killed him. What we were trying to do. I've got to find out who killed my father! I've gotta know! That ain't the question your friends were asking me. That wasn't too smart, Marshal. Don't you know what a good shot I am? Hell, it was you who told a judge in Jefferson you saw me kill old man Saxon at 60 paces. I wouldn't draw on anybody as good as that. You or someone you paid, it's the same thing. I was there to bury my father. He was shot in the back. I would have killed your old man if I'd been sure he was responsible for it, but I'm not. I wanna revenge my father. I don't give a damn about yours! Who was it? Who? Who was it? Maybe the same man who convinced you to accuse me. Don't give me that double talk! You know who it was! Not me. Somebody else does, though. A guaranteed income of 100 dollars a week, and with a little luck that could double. They told me that there's an awful lot of activity here. - Sure there's a lot of activity here. - Yes! But my little girl doesn't wanna get hitched. No reason to tie up an asset when the market's closed. Let's hope we can get as far as the saloon. I'm bone dry. Don't stop now. We're late already. Start firing the minute he walks out. No, wait a minute. Come on, over this way! He's gotta be in that wagon. Start shooting! No! You gotta get him alive! I'm gonna kill me a Saxon! All you'll do is just go and get yourself killed. And me too. What's going on here? Marshal, would you please tell me what's happening here? Philip Vermeer is in that wagon. The first duty of a marshal is the safety of his citizens. Do your duty without killing innocent people. Don't you try and teach me my job, David. I've noticed that you're a bit too hasty on the trigger, Eli. With the result that you've already killed innocent people. Listen to the way he's sweet-talking us. David Saxon has got more damn brains than all his brothers put together. He only counts murder when he can make it appear legal. You know where my father found the silver? Bring our people there. I said without killing innocent people! He'll get us all one day. Hey, you in the wagon. Make him come out or I'll open fire! - Get out of here! - Hold it a minute, Marshal! He ain't here no more. The wagon is empty! Quick! Go round the back. Find him! Turn the place inside out till you get him. We're leaving town in an hour. Go on and get packed now. What do you mean, you're leaving town? Where the hell are you going? To find us a quieter place to get buried in. - Hey, boss... - Marshal, you idiot! The stagecoach has arrived. Whoa! Jefferson-Saxon daily stagecoach arrived in Saxon City. - Anita. - Hey! You only help if they're young and beautiful? Oh, madam, never let it be said. Thank you, my good man. What the hell did you do with the stage? I lost it playing poker. You're talking to the Marshal, not one of your bastard friends. Why don't you talk to me, Marshal? What do you want in Saxon City, Clayton? I like peaceful places. Oh! Let's you and I go inside and have a talk. - After you. - Why? This isn't Jefferson. I'm in charge here. I'm glad to see a man who accepts his responsibilities. You shouldn't be wearing this star anymore. Should you? Bartender, bring us some whiskey. This man has come a long way to honor us with his presence. And make a little deal. You've gone into business? Strange, now that I've turned to the law. I'm after a man. Who? Philip Vermeer. Dead? Alive. First alive, then dead. It's the law of nature. That'd be a mistake, a bad one. He killed my father! That's a lie. You come here and start insulting me and think you can get out of here alive? That's not an insult. You just didn't tell the truth, on the stand either. The bullet through the Patriarch's head did not come from behind and you know it. Philip Vermeer was behind him, so it couldn't have been Philip. The judge in Jefferson condemned Philip Vermeer. That judge bought himself a nice big ranch right after the trial. You already said that in Jefferson and it cost you your star. Repeating it here will cost you a great deal more. I warn you, Clayton, keep out of our business! With people like you around who respect the law, I'm in no danger. I'm here drinking under the protection of an honest, incorruptible sheriff. According to the law, I got the right to throw out of town anyone who's a public nuisance or danger. And Clayton, I say that you are both. It sounds pretty bad. You've got 24 hours to get out of Saxon City. In the right-hand corner, his back to you. Who fired those shots? 24 hours, Marshal? Time sure goes fast in this town. Did you kill them? They never noticed it. You'll hang for this. All of you inside there, you're all witnesses! Murder without provocation. Clayton? Throw out your gun! Just a moment, Marshal. This man was only defending himself. And who are you? I came here to marry Adam Saxon. Maybe you know him. I wanna talk to the top man around here. That sure as hell isn't you. Remember, Adam, no witnesses, not even friends. Sure... Patriarch. I don't want to be called that and you know it! If you like calling things by other names. That all depends. Different things have different uses. Look. A nice surprise for you. Why doesn't Eli marry her? She would be better off. But women are stupid. She chose you. Is it really necessary? Of course it is. Her father was a State Supreme Court Justice. She'll be a precious asset to us. Sometimes you talk as if you wanted to become President. I like to look far ahead. This is the only one that's unoccupied. Are they all like this? There are others with women, there are others for card games, and this one is for shooting bullets in. Sleep well. Hold it! You haven't got enough trouble? You got to look for more, huh? You are the one who's in trouble, I'm just trying to get out of it. Move over. Now, would you like to tell me the name of the man who killed the Patriarch? It won't do you any good. These people condemned you to make it easier for themselves to get rid of you. You're preaching. Just tell me who it was. You get a horse and don't stop until you cross the border into Mexico. You stay here and you're dead. All right, we'll have to take a little walk to the Saxons. They'll know how to make you talk. I don't talk unless I feel like it. That's one of my rules. Let's take that little walk. Couldn't you think of anything better than to send those two right into the saloon against the best gun in the whole state? The former sheriff of Jefferson. The man who took the Patriarch to court three times. I could have charged Clayton with murder. Legally, just the way you like it. Then that woman had to turn up! Clayton knows who killed our father and I want him! Don't get carried away with your desire for revenge! It could have been anybody that night. Half of the state had reasons for killing the Patriarch. We will never know the truth. And trying to find out will only discredit ourselves. Everything is under control. The murderer has been condemned. Vermeer's friends are left without a guide. The silver is ours, everything legal and above board. It's Vermeer, he's back in town! Three thousand dollars walking around the streets. Go cash in on it! All right, Boon, saddle three horses. You have to go with Adam to the canyon tonight. And now what am I supposed to do? Put on your best manners. We have a guest for dinner tonight. Please excuse us for being late. Business is for us men what chattering is for you women. Pardon me, dear. And Adam, it's business which makes it necessary that you leave immediately. Brothers are the worst bosses, after wives. Please, excuse me. I'll be back for breakfast. I traveled with Philip Vermeer. He doesn't look like a murderer. The thing is, my dear, what matters is that he kills like one. I don't believe he killed your father. You must understand, Elizabeth, that in a violent country he who seizes today controls tomorrow. If you want a place in the Saxon future, you must do your share. As a good wife and mother, no more and no less. Unfortunately, I don't feel such blind loyalty to your family. If you'll excuse me, I don't feel well. Move aside, Sheriff, or I'll have to kill you. Get out of the way, Clayton. I wouldn't even bother with you, Holk. But Philip has some business to do with you and he doesn't wanna leave until it's done. Was it Holk who killed the Patriarch? No, he's the one who killed your father. Damn bastard, come on out! Here I am, Vermeer. Tell your friend to stand back or he's gonna get himself hurt. Hold it. You boys ought to do this by the rules. Put your guns away, both of you. You're on your own. Why don't you come closer? That's just the right distance for me. Don't move. Oh! You're finished too, Vermeer. You and your rotten friends. It's been mined. The road to the canyon has been mined. It'll kill all of you... "No witnesses, Adam." Here you are. Here's 5 dollars I got from the redhead and 20 I got from that blond one for special services. I ain't seen this much money since Dallas. Hm, very good. Now get back upstairs. I got clients waiting. Sorry to interrupt you, folks. Just pretend I ain't here. - Nothing I ain't seen before. - Let's wait until he's gone. Who, him? Man just said pretend he ain't there. That's good enough for me. Come on. He don't worry me none now. Let me show you something I learned from an old cow-poking friend of mine. Here, I'll show you. It goes like this. Hoo-hoo! Mind if I sit down? Would you like to play cards? There's too many guns pointed at us. It's always necessary to take a few precautions. I want peace in Saxon City. The case of the Patriarch's death is closed. Reopen it. I can't do anything. You're the Patriarch now. Why are you protecting Philip Vermeer? Because he's innocent. Let's say Eli didn't see so well that night. He's very emotional. Our father fell right at his feet. Let him tell that to the judge. Eli is pig-headed. He won't go for it. Besides... if Philip didn't do it, we have to point the finger at someone else. The real murderer. Is there anyone who knows who it is? You and me. We are both civilized and reasonable people. We can work a deal. I'm only interested in seeing that an innocent man doesn't have to pay for it. Suppose I pay you both 25,000 dollars? You take Philip and you keep him away from here. That's a pretty good deal, isn't it? I'm too old to sell myself and Philip is too young. So what? Adam Saxon! Come on outta there! I'm waiting for you! Is that generous offer of yours still open? Hold your fire! The sheriff from Jefferson wants to talk to that man. You can get up now, Philip. They won't shoot. Sure! The Saxons are men of their word. Now spill it or I'll blast a hole in you. You know a lot of things, don't you? David Saxon knows you didn't kill his father and he's gonna tell that to the judge in Jefferson. Now, put your gun away and let's get the hell outta here. They're not afraid anymore I'll take the place of my father. Do you know why? Cos dead people don't need a leader! Philip! No, Philip, no! He isn't dead. We'll hang him tomorrow, legally. Oh, and you better look out for Clayton. I'm sure he's still around. Right. Take him away. Don't worry, you'll be able to see him tomorrow, hanging from a rope. That is, if he doesn't die tonight. You evil-minded...! Really, my dear Elizabeth! That's not a very nice way to talk to anybody, especially the man you are about to marry. Never! Lock her in the cellar. Don't touch me! Let me go! Let me go! Now, we can turn the light up, brothers. Tomorrow our father's murderer will be hanged. And we remove the last obstacle in the way of the silver. Let us make this an era of... ...peace... ...of law... ...and of order. But according to Clayton we still won't have avenged our father's death. We're going to do more than that, Eli. We are going to make his dreams come true. With the wealth that silver load will bring us we can at last tighten our grip upon the capital, enough to make us the undisputed masters of the whole state. And one day... ...not so far in the future... ...there will be Saxons in Washington. And who knows? Maybe in the White House. David. You know who killed our father, don't you? Never. Do you hear me? Never ask me that question again. Aren't you going? You ought to lay off the bottle. September 13th, 1900, Ebenezer Saxon was murdered at Jefferson train station. In the name of the people of the United States, this man has been found guilty of murder and has been condemned to death and now his sentence will be carried out. Ah. You! Hangman! Remove your rope. That man is innocent! Clayton, get outta here. Don't challenge the law! Stay out of this, or get out of town! Philip Vermeer was accused of murder, of killing a Saxon by a court that was bought and paid for. He's not guilty! I know who killed the man you so lovingly call a patriarch. He's right here in this square. Then tell me, you bastard! Who killed my father? Who? Don't play his game, idiot. Order your man to proceed. Whoever stands in the way ofjustice does so at his own risk. You were there that night, David. Why don't you tell them? What does he mean? You're just a poor madman, Clayton, but a dangerous one. David knows who killed his father. But he accused Philip to get him out of the way. - You're talking nonsense. - To get his hands on that silver. If he goes on talking, Eli, he'll free him. David, I can't change what's inside me. I have to know! What's his name? Tell me, whoever it is! What do you want, Clayton? We know who killed the Patriarch. Him, Philip Vermeer, condemned by the court to death. - A court that was bought. - He killed my father. No, it wasn't me, David Saxon, - but you, you killed your father! - Shut your filthy mouth. All right. Tell 'em. Tell them the truth if you're stupid enough to get yourself hanged. Give him hell, Marshal! It was me. Your Patriarch was a murderer. There was no other way. So, you bastard, you killed my father! You murdered him! He was executed, not murdered, Eli. In Jefferson it was the only justice possible. Eli... Adam... David... God knows what else you've done but since that massacre you're just as guilty as your father ever was. And you are gonna have to pay for it. We'll have to settle with you once and forever. I'll be waiting an hour from now by the cattle pens. Fine with me. Thanks. You're cleared now. Stay out of it. You can't fight the Saxons on your own. I'll get a gun and join you. Philip, the Saxons are my business now. You can have everything, everything I own, my dear. You know what that means? A secure future, a family. Oh, what... What does it take to have you to say... yes? Easy. Pay with the usual price. Just 10 dollars, like everybody else has to. - All right, back inside, girls. - See you. Don't jump the gun, Eli. Wait. In a minute. Don't shoot till I give the signal. If we all draw out at once, one of us is bound to plug him. You better draw soon. We mustn't let Clayton start this or he'll kill us. He's faster than we are. Did they get you? I don't want that silver now, Clayton. I'm gonna go across the border. Sounds like you're running away. Here, you can put it back on now. Philip! Philip! Now there's a girl who'll keep you well out of trouble. Do you think so? So long, Philip. Philip! Yoo-hoo! Stage leaving for Jefferson, Silverbell and Gila Bend. All aboard. Ha! Ha-ha, ha!
