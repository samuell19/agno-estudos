NARRATOR: Some time ago, a group of filmmakers decided to see if sexual fantasies could be put on the screen in a way that would be both dramatically interesting and tastefully erotic. The producers placed advertisement in newspapers and national magazines, questioned people at random on the street, and held public and private interviews. It was decided that the fantasies should star the people whose imaginations created them. People who, for one reason or another, wouldn't mind interrupting the ordinary course of their lives in order to turn fancy into moments of photographed fact. Well, offhand, my sexual fantasy would be to see Raquel Welch and King Kong in a sexual relationship. I'd want to star in it. Well, that's it. You can star in it too. I have a fantasy of going around Manhattan with just my coat on and no clothes underneath. That's a secret fantasy. The kinky part is that they're all eating salad, and they use-- they use a certain kind of salad dressing. Can I say this? Sure, say anything you'd like. Well, they use fresh semen as their salad dressing. Well, how do they get it? They have to dispense it themselves from the waiter. Well, I don't think I'll be able to be in the film because I'm leaving town the end of this week. INTERVIEWER 1: Well, could you tell us what your fantasy would be? INTERVIEWER 2: You're leaving town? Yeah. I'm going to be leaving town because I'm going on this trucking trip. I'm going to be driving a tractor trailer for about six months. Firemen. INTERVIEWER 1: Firemen? INTERVIEWER 2: Firemen? Firemen. For some reason, the past-- INTERVIEWER 2: One fireman or? I think it's about the past three months. For some reason, they turn me on. My big thing is to make love to my own image in a woman. INTERVIEWER 2: To make love to your own image in a woman? That's right. A woman that will be my own image. INTERVIEWER 2: That would look just like you. Exactly. Sex is something that should be explored. INTERVIEWER 2: Right. You know, it's still a pioneer's field. [music playing] NARRATOR: During the weeks of interviewing, it became apparent that a great lack of inhibition was abroad in America, and that a wide variety of people would, if given the opportunity, step in front of a camera and act out their most intimate sexual dreams. Those who were anxious to appear in such a movie were invited to a private club in New York where an audition of their sexual fantasies took place and a final selection was made. My fantasy-- My fantasy is-- My sexual fantasy-- My fantasy begins-- My fantasy is-- My fantasy is being dominated by women. Is that it? Well, here we are in a locker room. I don't know what else to say, but welcome to "That's Hollywood." Well, I would like to be ravaged by a woman right now, if it can be arranged, which it probably will be. And I'm a loss for words right now. I would really like to see a couple make love. If I could be involved in the couple making love in a weightlessness situation, which would be the type of thing to where you have two people in a weightlessness situation to where it's just interaction between two couples. There's no bed. There's no outside influences. There aren't any sounds at all. It's just totally the pushing and pulling between me or whoever is acting out the part and the person. I don't know. Maybe-- maybe I've fantasized about her being tied down. I saw a movie the other night. "Lipstick"? Something that was on cable TV. And the girl was tied down to the bed. The guy tied her down. And I'm not saying that that's what I would like to do. But it's interesting. Well, maybe I'd want to. I'll tell you, I went out with a girl who wanted me to do that once, but I didn't have a rope. NARRATOR: It proved by no means an easy task to decide who should be chosen. Many fine fantasies had to be rejected, some because of the unique production problems they posed. My fantasy is to have a great big castle rock home, with great big staples sitting up on a big hill, with velvet drapes and plenty carpets, great big king-size beds with satin, to dress in leather, to be a sadist. I'd like to have a black leather suit, a black leather whip, and I would like to torture some other people that have done me wrong. I would like to give them the Indian torture. I'd take them in the desert and bury them alive with their pricks sticking up and the red ants to eat it up. NARRATOR: And then there were those fantasies that we felt had been too carefully contrived. Jesus, myself, and Mary Magdalene. And there she is before him, her face upturned, tears on her face. And now we have a cut to-- remember the soldiers there? Yes, the soldiers lusting after Mary Magdalene. She, in her agony, trying to decide how to make this easier for her Lord. And all of a sudden, it comes to her. MAN: As it were. Tell us what comes to her. The perfect way to ease his pain. Exactly. He is coming, he is coming, he is coming soon. And so, in fact, he does. NARRATOR: Others, though fascinating to listen to, were found to be a little too complex to be put on film. My fantasy, basically, is to embody the bringing together of the male-female split into a single mood and a single person. For most of my life, I have been feminine in relation to men and masculine in relation to women. And then played variations on that. Masculine with men and feminine with women. Until it got so complicated that the number of roles seemed beyond my ability to control. I'm at a point now where I think I can put the entire thing together in a single action. And what I want to do is to have one man and one woman to work with, to do various things with them, working faster and faster. Until it reaches a point where it becomes obvious that what I have become is an empty channel for what's flowing between the two of them, and attaining a pure androgynous state in that. NARRATOR: And some had to be abandoned for personal reasons. Nancy Morgan, a mother and business woman, felt it would be unfair to her family to go any further with her fantasy than an extremely candid interview. Most of my fantasies centered around degradation. I love to be degraded. I like to have someone shit in front of me, and play with it, and have to smear it on myself. I like to pretend I'm tasting it and be whipped while I'm tasting it, as if I'm really being made to taste it and I hate it. I like to be pissed on. I've only had one opportunity in my life to act out all these fantasies and more so, more than I've mentioned here, to the extreme. And it's with a person I love very much. I've done it, sort of superficially and less, with other people. But it took me many years to even bring up that I wanted to do them. And I felt that it's helped me to contact myself, the person I love, other people that we've gotten involved with. And it's made me-- actually, I feel a lot healthier and a lot more capable of really loving, aside from how bizarre. I find that with fantasies, it's far less genital or cold for me than even standard one night stands or whatever. Because when you expose yourself on this level, you have to really trust another person. NARRATOR: Weeks later, those who were chosen would be taken far from the neighborhoods of their daily lives out into a countryside of secret landscapes, a magical manor, a soft sloping hill, decorated with figures that have been fashioned to suit a variety of whims and desires. While one is here, everything is possible. And the most grotesque or sentimental wish will be granted. It was the job of the filmmakers to help people fulfill their fantasies. We provided the details of people, place, and costume. But from then on, the fantasies and fantasts were on their own. To perform in the fantasies, a resident company of actors was assembled to serve the imaginations of the film's amateur stars. They accepted the fact that they would be called upon to be everything from simple props of passion to embodiments of long sought-after perfect lovers. Most had been in erotic films before, but never when illusion and reality had been so finely mixed. How far are we to go with these people? In other words, I'm willing to do-- if it's a sexual fantasy, I'm willing to have sex with someone. But how far can I go into people's fantasies, in other words, where it could become abusive to myself, physically? People are into weird things. If they want to line me up and shoot me. I want to think there'd be some sort of psychological harm done to the people when they realize that the fantasy they might've nurtured for so many years, maybe all their life, is a failure, doesn't work, doesn't do anything for them. MAN: Well, that might be a benefit for some rather than harmful. Yeah, but it can be the opposite also. The thing that's different here is when you work, even in improvisation, you're working with actors that are very aware that what we're doing is illusion. In other words, a certain kind of professional attitude that you know, no matter what you're saying to the person you're acting with, that it's illusion here. WOMAN: Give and take. Right. It's like a ball game where we know where we are. We're playing, right? MAN: Exactly. NARRATOR: The star of the first fantasy arrives. She is Genie Joseph, a psychology student who has found her own special way to fill in the duller moments of the classroom. Like all those chosen for the film who will follow her, Genie will meet the actors and see the setting of her fantasy for the first time when she steps in front of the cameras. There have been no rehearsals, no script to study, and neither she nor the filmmakers know what will really happen once her scene begins. GENIE [VOICEOVER]: My fantasy is something I've been acting out, actually, in real life at school. I'm very turned on to one of my teachers. And he and I have this thing that we play during class. And I consider it psychic sex 'cause we're having all these things going on between us that are really very sexual and very erotic. Even though we haven't had sex, we're just having a lot of fun playing out the whole game. Well, what's happening is that we're going into what I'm imaging is happening in the class. Before that was his imagination. And this is what I'm thinking. So first, we get a closeup of me showing me going off. And this is what I do in my fantasy. Is vested in 1% of the population. And this 1% of the population controls an undue influence on-- on me. On-- on the government of that state. Now, who's to say that a communistic state has to be-- a communistic state has to be totalitarian. Go on. It can be-- it can be democratic. Whereas a capitalistic state can be totalitarian. It is not whether we're really against communism, but we should say that we're against totalitarianism because that's the real-- You know what I'm against? Yeah, I know what you're against. Go on. Yeah. Are you having trouble giving your lecture? It's difficult. It is. Is it getting harder? It may be soon. Now. GENIE [VOICEOVER]: I think it's wonderful if we can all accept that we have a fantasy life. And that that's not something to be hidden, and kept in the closet, and to feel guilty about. I think it's a beautiful side of ourselves. And bringing your fantasy out into the open, and accepting it, and even acting it out, leads it to change. I thought about that one day. I sat myself down and I asked myself, what is sex? What is it that we all want? What are we looking for? What I felt was that we want to feel that we're not separate people. That we're not just individuals walking around, and lonely, and feeling like separate egos. That we want to come together and feel that we can become close enough to the point of actually merging. That's, to me, the best sex. That's what I'm really interested in. I'm not really interested in having lustful sex except once in a while. Most of my fantasies take place either while I'm making love or when I'm masturbating. And sometimes, I have fantasies because I have trouble coming, and they excite me more, and they make it easier to come. And my favorite fantasy, and the strangest thing about it is that it's the weirdest one I have. And my closest friend had the same one. I'm lying on an operating table. I don't know where it takes place. And all these men are standing around me wearing dark suits. You want to see how I react when you touch me. And you want to see what I look like. And you're inspecting me. See, I'm afraid of you, but you're not affected by that at all. MARCIA [VOICEOVER]: I don't know if I'm tied down, but I know I can't get away. Calm down. MARCIA [VOICEOVER]: And they touch me in different places. And they watch me, and they watch my response. And there's one man who's in a wheelchair. That's so weird to me. No! No! No! No! Yes. No! No. No. NARRATOR: The girl being so rudely examined is Marcia Blau, a young writer who lives in New York. As the scene continued, she began to feel that her fantasy was becoming too real, and that discomfort and fear were gradually eroding any erotic feelings she might have. It was absolutely asexual. Acting out a fantasy is not the same as having one. And having people be harsh in a fantasy is actually soft and sensual, whereas in real life, it's not. The difference between keeping it in my head and doing it was that no one could be what I would imagine them to be because they're figments of my imagination. No one could be that. Well, I like to travel astrally. And the most fascinating thing that I find about it is the people that are involved in my astral travels aren't aware of it. And they are aware of the sensation, but as far as the physical body itself, they are not aware of. First, you gather up all the elements around you. The elements of the vibrations from the trees, the grass, the sky, the wind itself. And you collect all of it, and you get into chi. And you unite your spirit with the elements, and you travel naturally. You find the person. You hook onto their vibration and their spirit. And you flow throw the heavenly cosmic heavens. NARRATOR: Once the astral journey began, there was little to do except keep the camera on Taiiji and wait for something dramatic to happen. The wait turned out to be longer than expected. And we left Taiiji for the moment in order to return to more Earth-bound behavior. You may be interested in why I'm appearing without my face. I'm very interested in getting into this show naked, and I'm interested in telling you my fantasy. But I thought this was going to be a porn movie. And I have a family. And they might think it's unfair. My wife knows about this, being in this interview. My children don't know a thing about it. And I worked at civil service. And I was quite straight. And now that I've retired, I felt, gee, modern times. Why not get into all the act? So I've been out to the beach, and I'm going to tell you about what my fantasy of sex is. I went out to the beach at Brighton. No, I don't mean Brighton. I went out to the beach-- I won't give the name-- that they now have people dressing without any clothes. And it seemed very exciting and so on. And my fantasy is that I'm out there. And everybody's sitting there, some with clothes, some without clothes. And I fall asleep. And then I wake up, and there's a young girl come over to me. She's interested in tickling me. She's interested in having me have a party with her. And either we have a party on the beach, or we have the party in her place. And my fantasy goes on to all sorts of fun there, most of the fun similar to what you've probably heard in other people's fantasies. I'm 63, but you know, things don't change. And I visualize this girl on the beach, and there are a whole bunch of other girls on the beach, and fellas too, everybody getting into the act after this one girl starts with me. And I see her first. She tickles me. And I'm waking up. And I'm still relaxed. And I've just been dreaming of having a wonderful time with a girl. And she tickles me. And then I fondle her breasts. And she likes it. And we kiss. It was soul kiss. And then, it just gets great. And we're lying there. And jeez, I can't tell you how, in my fantasy, well, it's just like when I was 14 years old, and I had the first excitement. I didn't even know that such a thing could happen. I was going to come here for the interview. And I was thrilled to have the interview 'cause I wanted to explain more. But when I came to doing it now, just the fantasy itself started in with a little thing. I thought it was going to be a fantasy, and I could get into it. It sounded great. And I told my fantasy. And it was real. And it was sensuous. And it was great. And then when I came out and did it, everybody was such a help. And it was just beautiful. And I enjoyed it very much. And now trying to think back and try to think what effect I'm having on you, my audience, in this. And the part that I have in the whole big thing that all these wonderful people have been working for weeks on just to have a movie for you. I'm sort of stumped. 20 years ago, 30 years ago, I would have liked to feel the way what I felt when I was doing it, that I was doing a beautiful act, and that this was something that was going to be enjoyed by the people as something beautiful, not anything that in any way was taboo. NARRATOR: The liberation that took the gentleman in the last scene so long to achieve seems to have come naturally to Andrea Cox, the happily-married woman from Wyandotte, Michigan, who takes America's love of team sports, and football in particular, to a literal conclusion. ANDREA [VOICEOVER]: My name is Andrea. I'm a nurse. My husband wrote this. "I have always fantasized filming my wife making love with other men. And my wife dreams of making it with several men simultaneously. She even told me she'd like to make it with the New York Jets." He thinks this is just beautiful. It's a very big turn on for him. I mean, we love each other very much, and we have a very open relationship. Where I come from, it's a very strict Catholic area. And people are just not that open. I think they would like to be, but they just don't know how to be. They're afraid or something, which is really silly. But I just know so many people who would love to be in my shoes right now. Yes, I think this is fantastic. I want to do my scene. Play ball. [music playing] These are my angels. I'm taking these guys home with me. They're going to be my private football team. I really didn't notice anybody was here until just now. I don't want to say any more. Why don't you turn the cameras off? I'm embarrassed. Turn the cameras off. You can say hello to your friends and relatives. Hello, Aunt Bertha and Uncle Edgar. Oh, lost it again. If only you could see me now. They will. Yeah, they will. Aunt Bertha, hey! Think about distribution. Hey, Aunt Bertha, hey! Put contracts on their lives, area code 21-- Is this what you expected? Yes and better? Really? Yes. You want to do some more? Yes, yes. Overtime. Let's cut the film so I can finish. I don't think that there's too many people that can make love better than Barbara Jo and I. We get it on pretty good. And I think that whatever we do-- we do whatever turns a sign. In our fantasy, it's a type of thing-- OK, I'm the dominant person. Jim is the submissive one. In real life, I don't think it's that way at all. It's definitely not that way. He's over me, which I like. And I really like that a lot. I don't know if, subconsciously-- NARRATOR: Liberation does not always lead to Andrea's happy ending. Sexual freedom can become something indulged in for the sake of fashion rather than individual desire. --do whatever I want. We were into a bondage type thing through a magazine, either "Penthouse" or "Gallery," one of the magazines. And they had a picture of a torture chamber type situation. And we had been getting into a bondage type scene before that for our own personal gain. And we saw this, and we said, hey, that would be neat. Except I'm a registered nurse. And we thought it would be neat to do it with me being a nurse and Jim being a patient. The setting takes place in a treatment room supposedly, a type of a hospital setting. And a patient is brought in. And of course, he is impotent. And me being a superstar nurse, I'm going to come in and cure him of his impotence. You call this a cock? No wonder you can't get it up. You can't get anybody attracted to it. NARRATOR: Barbara Jo and Jim, a handsome couple from Cudahy, Wisconsin, confidently arrived on the set with a pre-fabricated fantasy taken from those underground manuals that purport to add spice and variety to our lovemaking. With them, they brought their own costumes as well as a detailed list of things suitable for a scene of light bondage and domination. See, we like to give an overall body massage. That way, all your muscles are just nice and relaxed. For some reason, you just don't seem to be getting hard. What does turn you on usually? Easy now. I think I might have to teach you from the beginning. Just hug me tender and patient. Lie down. I want to fuck you, baby. Then why can't you get it up? Let my arms free, and I'll get it up. I don't like my patients not to cooperate, you arrogant bastard. You just lay down there. And I want you to relax, just relax, baby. Because what I'm going to put you though, you'll never forget. Talk to me again. I can't hear you. I don't know what you're feeling. How in the hell are we supposed to know what you're feeling? Aren't these three women enough for you? Do you want four, five, six? What the fuck do you want? Make it hard, baby, you can do it. Oh, please, please, please. You've got to. Don't ruin my reputation, punk. Please. You're still not working. You're not making my ego any better, punk. What do you think I am? Just a play toy. I'm trying. Don't you want to get hard for me? Yes. Aren't you hot for me? Yes. Don't you want to fuck me? I want a nice, hard, fucking cock. NARRATOR: It became apparent that the paraphernalia and role-playing were proving of little help to Jim and Barbara Jo. They both struggled to achieve a state of physical passion. But the struggle finally became painful to everyone concerned. And there was a general agreement to stop filming a scene that was not being enjoyed by the people in it. MAN: All right. All right. Cut. I felt that I had something to prove that I ended up not proving. That's what I felt. MAN: What was that you had to prove? Well, I tell you, I feel that I-- what I said when I first walked into here, actually, happens to be a fact. And under the stress of the situation or whatever it might be, I couldn't-- I don't feel that I did what I wanted to do, OK. Hey, man, I have been in every whorehouse from that side of Vietnam to the other side, and in Moscow, and in Madrid, Spain, in a lot of different places. And this is not-- take it for what it's worth, believe it or not, that's the god's honest truth. And I've read porn books or whatever you want to call them since I was this high. And I figure that we really that we can get it together and I wish I wish that I could have it on film. NARRATOR: While the preceding scenes were being filmed, a camera had been kept on Tajie, waiting to record the slightest signs of astral passion. Before leaving, she had mentioned that her flight plan included the beach of Waikiki, where she hoped to beguile a Hawaiian surfer. From the way she was breathing, it seemed something pleasant was happening on voyage. But questions as to where she was or who she was with still brought no response. While the wait continued, the production prepared for the fantasy of Sterling Jones, a young man who had made it very clear where he wanted to be and what he wanted to do when he got there. Well, my fantasies is I always had dreams about-- I was a paper boy. I usually delivered to this elderly man and lady. They had a nice house out in the country. And I had a paper route out there. And I stopped by their house as I usually do. And I didn't know they were on vacation. But their daughter was there with her friends. And they were smoking pot and everything. And they were in their pajamas. [music playing] Hello. Hi. I'm here to collect a bill from your father. No. I mean, he's not here. Oh, well. You come in, OK? -Oh? -Yeah. You sure? Yeah. Hey, I want you to meet my friends. Come here. Come on. -We're high. -Hello. Hi. How are you? Oh. Hi. Hi. Why don't you join us? I bet you won't get to the papers. I bet it's better than my papers. We can have a party. Hey, you want to get stoned? Sure, OK. STERLING: I ain't going to need this. WOMAN: Come on, let us look. WOMAN: Yeah, I've never seen. WOMAN: Get out of the way. WOMAN: Aw, come on. Come on, let's get it on. Break it. Baby mama. Oh, man. WOMAN: You're really good at this. Totally. Do it to me. WOMAN: Hey, come on. Let somebody else in. WOMAN: This is a part, we have to share. There's enough for everybody. WOMAN: Next. Well, my route was like this. [inaudible] WOMAN: No. You just tell your boss you took a lunch break. Dinner break. Coffee break. That was beautiful. That was fantastic. It was even better than my fantasy. It was beautiful. That was so beautiful. Oh, man. All those pretty ladies. Oh, I just couldn't believe it 'cause in my fantasy-- a fantasy is something that's unreal. And this came to life. And it made me kind of nervous, but it was fantastic. It was beautiful. And I'd love to do it again. I'd do it again, and again, and again, and again. It's fantastic. My fantasy, basically, is fem. What I mean is I love fem. I love to be around fem. And I also like to be fem. I like to dress in feminine clothes. I like to be around girls. But yet, the unusual part about it is I'm really not gay. And I just love to be and be fem, like I just said, which would seem a little unusual. But basically, I like to have somebody, let's say, start either completely dressed as a girl or the other way around. And every time I see female clothes, that turns me on too. NARRATOR: Sandy Light, a transvestite from Riverdale, New York, walks into a lesbian bar that he has seen many times in his imagination. The women present accept him as one of their own sex. And the owner of the bar finds him, as a woman, an exciting interlude in an otherwise slow evening. In his fantasy, Sandy's true sex remains hidden during the preliminary caresses, and seduction, and the difficult removal of the many baffling female garments in which he'd wrapped himself. Why the hell do you wear all this crap? All you've got to do is lose about 8 pounds, and you wouldn't need all this shit on. Well, I'm quite heavy over here. See? Over where? Well, why don't you just see for yourself? All you have to do is pull the buttons. The buttons here? Mm-hmm. Is this a joke? How do you know I'm not going to be a little bit up tight and throw you the hell out of here? I just hope you won't because everyone needs a little change. Really? Mm-hmm. NARRATOR: When the secret behind the slips, zippers, pads, and girdle is finally revealed, Sandy proves that clothes do not necessarily make the man and convinces his sophisticated lesbian lover that even old-fashioned heterosexuality can be used now and then for a refreshing change of pace. That's nice. I thought it was very good. I thought that it was acted out really to the T. It's what really could happen, did happen, and it turns me on. MAN: How did you feel afterwards? I'm only asking because it seems that though you tell that you feel very satisfied, you look very morose, very sad. Is it post-coital depression? No. It's just the fact that, believe it or not, being this way, I must feel very messed up. And when I feel messed up like that, it upsets me. So that's why I might feel a little sad. MAN: Do you feel we're really prying into an intimate moment now? Well, at the end of a fantasy such as mine, when you're physically messed up, hair, dress, et cetera, actually, that is an intimate moment. Because you want to go back to she again. And usually, because of that, you would like to be left alone. My fantasy is-- well, one good one is that I can become, at will, a man. I can just go-- and I'm a man. But my mind is still that I'm a woman, only I look exactly like a man, and I'm really gorgeous. And I go into this gay bar. And I'm out to get this guy. I'm really out to get him. He screwed me over, so I'm really out to get him. So I go into the bar, and I pick him up. NARRATOR: Where Sandy hid his true self for the sake of a pleasant surprise, others assume a sexual change for less happy reasons. Terri King, a New York secretary, had suffered for five years from the effects of a love affair with a man who was homosexual. Now, in her fantasy, she wants to overcome this unhappy memory by assuming a male form and enticing the image of her former lover into a scene of embarrassment and revenge. I knew that he was gay. But he would always do all this really physical stuff. He would always really come onto me, sexually, all the time. And then when he really got me so that I really fell in love with him, he started going back into the bit, well, this will never work out. And then part of the time, he would be, well, I really love you, and I want this to work out. And the rest of time, he would be screwing around with guys and saying it's never going to work. So in the end, I really got screwed over because I really fell for him. I missed you last Friday, Terri. TERRI: Last Friday? Yeah. We had a date at 8:00. Remember? Oh yeah. I forgot all about it. Well, listen, this is a new night. And we can just pretend that our date was for this night. It's early, right? Just like we were going to meet, right? Mm-hmm. And we could go out now. Maybe. Really? TERRI [VOICEOVER]: I put him off sexually, I don't do anything with him. After a while, when he really gets into me, I decide, finally, I'm going to go to bed with him. And we just get to the point where we're really going to do it, where he's really getting off. And then I change back into me, and I really freak him out. Can you just wait here for a second. Just wait here for a minute. OK. Just a minute. It is something that I get off on the thought of doing because it's a revenge kind of thing that I could never do except in my mind. And the idea that I could really, really do this to somebody who really deserves it. You rotten son of a bitch. Nothing? Nothing? You can't even say anything? You could sure say enough things before, enough things you said to me. -[whispers] -What? I meant it. You meant what? You meant what? Everything. Everything when? You meant everything tonight, you rotten son of a bitch, because you thought I was this big, macho guy. Well, now you're surprised, huh? -No, I did. I meant everything. You meant everything you said when? Everything I said, every time. Every time. No, you didn't. You son-of-a-bitch, you just want to come crawling to me now just because I showed you up for what you are. Oh my god, look at the look on your face. How could you even look at me after all that? How could you even look at me, coming here in this. And you can even look at me? You should be so fucking embarrassed, you should crawl under the god damn bed. Is that what you want? Yeah, that's I want you to do. I want you to crawl under the bed like the little worm you are. Crawl under there, you fucker. If you want me to crawl under that bed, you've got to push me under that bed. Push you under the bed, huh? OK, I'll push you under the bed. Just get the fuck under there, you bastard. God damn, you son-of-a-bitch. TERRI [VOICEOVER]: It was fun telling him off. Stay there where you belong, asshole. What am I going to do tonight? WOMAN: Yeah. Oh god. Oh, I don't know. I'll probably go out and get drunk. I feel-- I don't know. Well, my fantasy is entitled "The Feather Fantasy." And it takes place in pilgrim times, and it's the town square. And there are 10 men lined up at the stocks with their arms tied behind them. And the feather person, which is the part I would like to play, comes by them, undresses them very quickly. And he goes up with a feather to each of their cocks. And this is the most important part, is that he tickles them, and they get hard. And when they all come, they are released. And they have to go back into the town square. And it's humiliating for them. It doesn't matter what they did that was wrong, probably wasn't even wrong. But it doesn't matter. This is their punishment. Wipe that smile off your face. I want them to really get turned on by it. They are enjoying it, but it's humiliating to be enjoying it in public. The idea is that they get turned on in spite of the fact that they're straight and by the humiliation. But that's very difficult to happen realistically. My fantasy is irrational. Fantasies aren't rational things. Here, you. What? Suck his cock. No. I said suck his cock. No. Suck his cock. You better listen to me. You do what I tell you. Get down. Carl. CARL: Yes, James. Well, what are we going to do because-- well, it's not working. I'm sorry. How do I feel? I feel like you should have gotten gay guys for my fantasy. I mean, they're straight. They're attracted to women. I want to say I'm sorry if I hurt you. No, the whipping I rather liked. Did you get off on ripping our clothes off? Yes, I got off on that. I got off on that, very much. -It was very aggressive. -Very much. -I liked that too. -Yeah. That's the bit we all liked. But I'm a little disappointed that I didn't get to see you all come. I would like to see that. I'm very disappointed. I think you should have gotten people who would have been able to be turned on by this. I think that's your job. I told you my fantasy. You know what had to be done. And it's understandable that straight guys wouldn't be able to get it up that way. This is obviously a straight film with little outlook as to how a gay person might perceive it, I think, because of the outcome of my fantasy, and also the people that were chosen. The three guys, they're not fantasy figures for me. I was a little disappointed with the choices. MAN: Are you pissed off at us? A little. MAN: Why? A little pissed off. I'm disappointed. NARRATOR: Other fantasies faltered in the making. John Smoczyk can Karen Frohardt, a couple from Seattle, Washington, who wanted to make love to clowns in a funhouse surrounded by distorting mirrors, got lost in a pleasant but aimless orgy, and forgot about completing their scene. Esther Lester, a truck driver from New Jersey, used a little too much bourbon to prepare for her performance. And her dream of being an artist's model came to an untimely end when she had to be helped down from her pedestal. And Don Farrar from Omaha, Nebraska, who wished to be one among a group of waiters whose semen would be used as salad dressing by ladies at an elegant outdoor luncheon, found it too difficult to contain his excitement until the proper course, and prematurely seasoned the ladies' soup. Some people's fantasies changed in the process of being filmed. Jim Mann, a student from Rutgers University, wanted at first to experience being made love to by a trio of women. No, no, I'll tell you what I'm really nervous about. I'm just nervous about taking my clothes off. That's what I'm nervous about. MAN: That's what you're-- That's the whole thing right there. That's what I can't break through in my mind. That's the main thing that's making me so nervous, I can't even talk. NARRATOR: Carol Ann Baumberger also wanted to appear in an orgy of more than modest proportions. MAN: Why do you want to be in this shot today? It's going to help me in my own scene, to get to know people, and how they act and react to each other. And besides, if it turns me on, well, then that's worth the whole thing. I'm going to try to make his fantasy as good as I want mine to be. NARRATOR: However, when Jim and Carol Ann met before the cameras and the shooting of Jim's fantasy began, they were so taken with each other that they both forgot to behave in proper orgiastic fashion and simply made love to each other. Jim, now much more relaxed than when he arrived, left to return to school and recount his adventures to his friends. But Carol Ann had enjoyed herself so thoroughly, that she decided to stay on location and appear as often as possible in the fantasies of others. And then there was Greg Hart, a high school psychology counselor, whose fantasy nature itself conspired to inhibit. But my sexual fantasy is that I would like to be with a blonde chick, a blond girl. She has to have blonde hair. She doesn't have to be that great looking or that nice looking. She doesn't even have to be that busty either. 36 is acceptable. 24, 36. But what I would like to do with her is, first of all, I'd like to make out with her. And then after that, well, that's foreplay. And then after that, really, this is the necessary part, is the lubrication. The lubrication would be Crisco oil in a can. Then I would like to put my hand into the Crisco. And then with my fingers, slowly enter her ass, very, very slowly and very gently. And in a way, fist fuck her, is what the terminology is. And when I'm going in, I'm not going for depth. Depth, you would go right up to the arm. But I'm going for width, which is that way. I can't overemphasize, the [inaudible] like a dream come true. But you're real. Mm-hmm. I'm really here. Every part of you. You can do whatever you want. Make me feel more comfortable. Take my jacket off. Now kiss me. Your skin is so remarkable. Why? It's so white. So white. I need your mouth on my cock. Want me to open your pants? Not yet. OK. Take my shirt off. Take your blouse off. Not fast enough. You're perfect for me, do you know that? Do you know that? You're perfect. Just what the doctor prescribed. OK. Unbutton me. I didn't say unzip, did I? I said unbutton. Did I say unzip? OK. I just said unbutton, period. Good. Now unzip. Is that the right way to treat my clothes? Put it right there. Up. Down. And suck. Take it all in. [inaudible] Take your panties off. Take your shoes off. Know what I'm going to do with this cock? What? Turn over. Over. [slap] Over. [slap] [scream] Sit. Now what I'm going to do, I'm going to take the Crisco, work it into my hands, work it into your ass. Understood? Yes. Don't worry. Everything's going to be all right, OK? Mm-hmm. You let me know when there's the least bit of pain. All right. Let me know. Not yet. GREG: OK. That's all you have to say, OK? OK. Do you trust me? WOMAN: Yes. If you trust me, relax. OK? Is the position comfortable for you? WOMAN: Mm-hmm. Then maybe if you open your legs up a little bit. Good. OK. Now just relax and think of me. OK? Just relax. I see you are resistant, aren't you? Do you know what I do in a case like this? Hm? Do you know what I do? WOMAN: What? -Hm? WOMAN: What? I won't, but I have feelings for you. You know I would force it in anyway. I would force my hand in there. Then I would put my cock in. But since I have feelings for you, I can't. [slap] Just remember next time though. OK? I was a little spaced out, I guess. I was very disappointed in myself that I didn't-- I couldn't fulfill his fantasy because I had really, really wanted to. I didn't know what it was, but I thought whatever it was, I could certainly handle it. Were you frightened? Was I frightened? Yeah. I think I was frightened the first time he hit me. You know, your initial thing is panic when somebody hits you, especially as hard as he hit me. But then I thought, well, maybe that'll be the only time he hits me, so I would be willing to put up with that. MAN: Why didn't you stop it? I didn't want to stop the scene. I wanted to keep it going. I thought I would take it as far as-- I thought I would take it to the end. But you were terrified of that guy. Yeah, he was pretty crazy. You could tell by looking at his eyes. I don't know what it looked like in the film. But when I looked in his face, he didn't see cameras. He didn't see any other people in the room. He just saw me. And he was really into it. He was going to fulfill his fantasy. And I was going to try to help. As far as I'm concerned, the person I do this with is just an object. MAN: But it could be with someone you love. Yes, very much so. MAN: And would that change your attitude at all? Do you think you could do it to someone you love? You're really hitting a real point that-- I really-- I don't think I could. To me, I have to divorce and separate the two different things. I can't say what I haven't experienced. But I don't think I could do it. I think I could only do it as an object. And if I fell in love with this particular woman, I think that would cease. I don't think I could do it. NARRATOR: Sexual violence takes a more complex and mysterious form in Robert Kazmayer's imagination. Filled with personal symbols and images, his erotic dream is both frightening and beautiful. My fantasy begins in a chapel. In the chapel, there is a woman. She's past her prime of life. She was once very attractive, but she's not very-- the shades of her beauty are still there. She's dressed in the outside of a wedding gown, the diaphanous part. But underneath, she's completely nude. She prays in the chapel. And then I am there. And I see myself as a young man, probably younger than I am now. I feel somewhat numb. This wasn't what I wanted to happen. But it has happened. [music playing] And then we are walking through a woods. First, we walk slowly. She starts to walk ahead of me. She looks back. Something in my face scares her, and she starts to run. [scream] Stop it! I am on a beach. The sun feels good on my back. NARRATOR: After so much strain and mayhem, we return to the quiet repose of Tajie. Since the production would soon be coming to an end, it was a relief to see signs that Tajie was returning to us. I see a surfer. I am reaching out towards him. He's yielding completely. Together, we're climbing closer to the top. Closer. It's now. I can say, very honestly and truthfully, that everyone, should they decide to take up astral travelling, they would find it a kind of a relaxing vacation away from the body in itself. I've got this dress at home. And it's white. It's a long gown. NARRATOR: It was curious that of all the people who participated in the making of this movie, only Vanessa Vanderbilt, now arriving in the limousine, used the notion of being filmed as an integral part of her fantasy. Having enjoyed a rich variety of sexual experiences in her private life, she now wanted to see if she had the courage to repeat some of them in front of a camera. [music playing] VANESSA [VOICEOVER]: And I imagine myself coming into-- it's like a big party, a big dance, a ball. And my head has a light bandana of some kind. And I spot him or her. And it just flows. We're dancing, the music is right, all night. I love doing things that are not the norm. I like doing things that are sneaky. NARRATOR: As soon as the music and filming began, it became apparent that Vanessa was having no trouble at all making her secrets a subject for public viewing. By her scene's conclusion, Vanessa had become so adept at collaboration with the cameras that she improvised a lovely scene of photographed passion. VANESSA [VOICEOVER]: If I were to say I felt alive, the word "alive" would be toning down what I really felt. To be able to be open, honest with myself, to share, to love. It's like I just came into the world. I don't masturbate often since I don't have to. But when I do, it's not the picture of a woman, or the picture of two women, or the picture a man and a woman. It's a picture of myself that I like. See, I can see my body. I can see myself there. And I'm attracted to it. I want to touch it. I want to feel it. Just to know that I could go like this, and this is my body, turns me on. I love the way I move. I love the way I talk. I love-- oh, it's so good. I love the way my skin feels. And I love the shape of my penis. I love to touch it. I love to caress it. It doesn't even have to be sexual all the time. Just to touch it, just to feel it, it's so wonderful. It's like an extension of myself. And that extension of myself makes me feel whole, makes me feel complete. I would love to make love to myself, even as a man. But if I could transform myself in a woman, I could make love to that body there, which would be me as a woman, that would be so good. First, I want to look at myself from all angles. Up and down. My face. Look at my hands touching me. Touching me all over. Christ, it feels good. And I want to see myself as a woman. I need-- I need first, my hair to be long and flowing. My hair needs to be long, long so I can entwine my fingers around them. My hair. As I put my wig on, I'm well aware that my face-- my face is showing. It's showing-- showing my passion. I look beautiful. I'm-- I'm making love to myself. You-- you are the image of myself. You are me. [speaking non-english language] Oh. You get me so excited. [moaning] I did it. And on top of that, I have perfect teeth. I am the best fuck I would ever get. Don't you see it? NARRATOR: The last fantasy comes to an end. The toys and gadgets of movie-making are put away. And cast and crew begin to return to the realities of the city. Before everyone goes his separate way, a gathering is held that is both a farewell party and a private screening for those whose fantasies have been put on film. The stars, collected all together, watched themselves in performance and saw how their dreams looked from a distance. Some, of course, were delighted by what was on the screen. Oh, I'm definitely in love with myself. There's no two ways about it. What happened? Come on. How can you do that? This one again? Aw. I was just getting turned on again. MAN: Want to see it again, Roberto? Next time, I will shave, see what happens. MAN: Next time, you'll what? Shave. Shave the beard. It was even better than I expected. I smiled all the way home on the plane. The man next to me said, you look so happy. And I said, oh, I am. I am. I thought maybe I'd work on the hockey teams next. [cheer and applause] Yeah, I had a beautiful time. It was the best time I had in my life. Exactly. Love it. Sexy devil. God damn, you sexy devil. And I know I'm not crazy. A lot of the feelings, and my thoughts, my desires, they're not the norm. And I'm not crazy. All of you accepted that. OK. You better believe it. You accepted it. It was just-- you helped make it all possible. And since then, I've just felt, I am OK. I'm fucking OK. Really did a lovely, beautiful sex act without it being what they call dirty these days. Oh, this is as good as the jury duty that I was on for 52 days. NARRATOR: But some were baffled and found it difficult to believe that they were really part of the scenes they looked at. It was so strange. I don't think I really looked like a man, because I know that I'm not. But I don't know if I would look like one to somebody who didn't know. I never told the real guy exactly what I told the actor. I really never let that anger come out like I should have. Probably, I would have been a lot happier in the long run. I have to say to myself, why do I have such a fantasy? And if I have such-- to have such a fantasy of destroying the one that I love means that the last scene must be there. MAN: But the last scene is you wearing a dress in church, which is absolutely fascinating. Because I have, in a way, become-- the act of destruction means that I must take on the loneliness of her, the longing, the guilt. And all of that, I expressed that way. I'm able to realize that my fantasies have to stay fantasies. NARRATOR: And some were frankly not too happy with the image of themselves they now offered for public viewing. While I was watching, I'm saying, is this really me doing it? Is this me? And seeing-- OK, that's part of me. And that's the part inside of me. See, I'm usually a quiet, reserved, very shy guy. The part inside that wants to cry out is that part. And that's what I did. NARRATOR: Nevertheless, they all felt it had been an experience from which they had learned a great deal about themselves. And later, as they danced and celebrated the end of their movie, a close comradeship formed among them. As for those of us who made the film, all we can truthfully say about the behavior you've watched is that it was spontaneous and unforced. You may have found it compelling, offensive, or amusing. But it was human behavior for which neither apologies nor theories are really needed. [music playing]
