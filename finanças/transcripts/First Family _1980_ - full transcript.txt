[Manfred on TV] 'And so, my fellow Americans' 'allow me in closing, to emphasize once again' 'that the aims and purposes of this administration' 'are the aims and purposes of all our citizens.' 'Men, women and children' 'regardless of sex' 'regardless of color.' 'Black, white, red, yellow' 'and all of the equally attractive shades in between.' 'Let us remember always that we can' 'and will accomplish these goals' 'because our purpose and our resolve' 'are derived from an unshakable belief' from a benevolent power worshipped by all of us under many names. And through whose all-seeing omnipotence I shall humbly say goodnight. [instrumental music] [man on TV] Ladies and gentlemen this has been a nationwide address by President Manfred Link coming to you directly from the Oval Office. For a printed transcript of tonight's speech please send 25 cents and a stamp self-addressed envelope to "Mr. President, White House, Washington DC." [indistinct murmuring] We are back in our Washington studio. We've just heard President Link's State of the Union address and here with me to lend us his personal observations on the President's speech is Senator William "Wild Bill" Hubley. Welcome, senator. Thank you, Howard. Senator Hubley, what is your perception of how the President's speech will be received by Congress? Well, Howard, I dowant to study the President's remarks a bit before I try and second guess my colleagues on the hill but, but I think I can safely say that it's a "good news, bad news" situation. And what is the good news, senator? Well, the good news is that the President is quite obviously in firm control of a number of tricky situations both on the national and the international scene. 'And what's the bad news?' Well, frankly speaking, in terms of implementing any of the programs that he's outlined I think and and I mean this is no disrespect toward our fine citizens of oriental extraction uh, that the President hasn't got a Chinaman's chance. Of course, we have to point out that you do represent the opposition party. Oh, yes, but the loyal opposition. I am not in agreement, for instance with my great good friend Senator Bailor. Yes, I believe he referred to President Link as a "depraved halfwit." Yes, he did and I-I think that could be called overreacting. The President is nota depraved halfwit. - 'He is not, you say?' - Oh, certainly not. Of course, that's the kind of exaggeration we can expect in an election year but halfwit, no. Depraved, I seriously doubt it. [door slams open] [Howard] 'It has been suggested that the members of your party' 'have been doing everything they can' 'to see that the president's problems' 'are never re-provoked.' Who is it? [Howard] 'You and your congressman' 'have been using every possible means at your disposal..' [moans] [grunts] Bye. It was nice meeting you. [Howard] 'Is that fair?' [man on TV] 'Well, Howard, I don't know what you mean by fair' 'but you have to remember' 'a number of hard facts about politics.' 'Not the least among them being that we are spending' 'a great deal of money to win an election' 'and-and people get really upset if they give you a lot of money' 'and then lose.' 'That I think is..' [engine turns over] [tire screeches] [siren wailing] [William] 'And of course the president has to face the fact' that he's dealing with the Congress in which his party is in the minority. Uh, but, senator, the Congress will have to face the fact that President Link was elected to office by a slim but definite majority. Uh, yes, but that victory must be weighed against the fact that his opponents, the presidential and vice-presidential candidates of my party were killed in that tragic automobile accident three days before the election. And it must be remembered that nearly 30 million Americans actually voted for the two corpses. [siren wailing] Hi, Fred, what time you get off? [Manfred] 'Now, tell me this, did she still have her pants on?' [female agent #1] 'Yes, Mr. President.' - Where were her hands? - 'That was hard to tell, sir.' 'The room was very dark.' I see. That's for the senator from Iowa. Oh, Mr. President, would you save me a pen, please? Okay, I-I would say her hands were in a relatively uncompromising attitude, sir. I see. Oh, let's make this one the senator from Connecticut. Mr. President? A pen? How exactly did she get away? [male agent #1] 'We lost her in the crowd, sir, at the Kennedy Center.' 'That was just after the Annual Oldies but Goodies concert.' Okay, no more Oldies but Goodies. No more concerts at all. That's for the senator from Texas. Sir, the vice president would like a pen. If you can't do your job, I'll find someone who can and you'll be back patrolling the toilets in the State department, is that clear? - Yes, sir. - Yes, sir, Mr. President. Alright, now, get out of here and go-go protect someone or whatever it is you do. - Yes, Mr. President. - Absolutely, Mr. President. [camera shutter clicks] - I never get a pen. - Just hold on, please. - I just-- - Look.. This one is just like it. Take it. [Manfred] 'Alright, this, this is the last one.' 'Who's, who's left?' Who didn't get the souvenir pen with the gold embossed presidential seal? Mr. President? Oh, the senator from Rhode Island? Come on. Come on. [all laughing] Well, alright, if you don't care what I think then you should at least have some consideration for your father. Now, he has this whole country to run, dear and it is a very tough, very demanding job and he needs our help. Don't you see, dear, that the commander-in-chief of the greatest armed force in the entire free world cannot have the people saying that his daughter is a nymphomaniac. For God's sake, mom, how can you say I'm a nymphomaniac when I've never even done it? It's not what you've done that counts, dear. It is what people think you've done. Yeah, well, I-I've never even been alone with a boy for more than ten minutes. I remember back when dad was mayor, you said-- Now, you were just a child then and it was only for a year-- Right, and then he went into Congress and I had to wait for two years after that. - You were a teenager-- - Then he gets into the Senate. And then it's six more years-- The senator's family must be above and beyond reproach. Now he's been president for four years and I haven't even had a real date. That's right, dear, because someone like yourself must set an example. Mom, I am 28 years old. And that is right. That is right, dear and in just a few years a few years from today after your father has served out his second term if God and the people are sensible enough to see that he is reelected then we can go back home and lead a normal life, dear and how, but, however until then, we must act in accordance with our station. Now, you want the respect and admiration of the people, don't you? - Yeah. - Yes, of course you do. But not as much as I wanna do it. Just once. Just see what it feels like. Gloria, don't talk like that, dear. It does not suit you. - Mom. - Yes? - Tell me something. - Yes? Do, uh, you and dad still, um.. ...you know, do it? We do, we.. [clears throat] ...we do it now and then. We do it when our busy schedule permits. I hate this. I hate my life. I wish we were like normal people. I wish dad were a street car conductor or something. Well, of course you do. Millions and millions of people do, dear. But he's not, and we have to be happy with that. We have to be happy with what we got. Now, however, what about that nice young man who came to dinner last week with his parents? 'What was his na.. He was the son of the secretary' 'of something or other..' He looks like a turnip. He looks like a turnip, dear. That's right, because his mother looks like a turnip. But looks are not everything, dear. He seems like a very intelligent boy. He's a fairy. He is a fairy, dear, well, t-that's because his father's a fairy, but that does not mean that you cannot have a very nice relationship...with him. - Mom, mom. - What? That's not the kind of relationship I want. - Then what? - I wanna be like real people. - And what is it? - I mean.. I just wanna put on old comfortable clothes and stuff and, and drive a nice sports car down to the beach. - A sports car? - And run along the sand. And maybe meet a nice, tall, average blonde guy. - Yes. - Or maybe three or four. And lie down on a blanket and they, like, rip my clothes off and start grabbing at me everywhere, and I moan and scream dirty words and then I'm carried off into a.. ...pitch of ecstasy and, and then we start performing every kind of bizarre, physical act, rolling over and over until we're smothered, and I'm just trapped in hot, male flesh, and then I burst.. [percussive music] [music continues] Even if you have to interrupt a debate just tell the ambassador that the delegation from Upper Gorm has arrived. He wants to get to them before the Chinese. Agreed. As a position that it will be recognized by a majority of the distinguished members as one of sensible if adamant support for the conclusions already submitted in the inter-committee report. [yawning] And may I suggest that, uh, we end the apparent monotony of the discussion by bringing the issue to a vote? [speaking foreign languages] [blowing nose] May I suggest further that if the distinguished representative has concluded his absolutely fascinating display of bodily eruptions he apply his apparently limited powers of concentration to the...subject in hand? [translating to Arabic] [speaking Arabic] May I suggest that.. [speaking Arabic] Uh, the distinguished member of the, uh, United States delegation.. [continues speaking Arabic] ...is, uh, is not fit to suck on my hat. I'm sorry? [speaking Arabic] Ah, it's an old Arabic saying. Please inform my distinguished colleague that such epithets are better reserved for the savages he so obviously represents. [translating to Arabic] [speaking Arabic] Uh, considering the, uh, amount of oil exported by my country to his country.. [speaking Arabic] [chuckling] '...the, uh, American ambassador' like his government, knows what section of my, uh savage anatomy...he may kiss. Kiss? Poopie. Thank you. You can tell my distinguished colleague that he can meet me in the parking lot whenever he chooses even if he is wearing a dress. [translating to Arabic] [speaking Arabic] Hmm. Well? I'd rather not say, sir. What do you mean, you "Rather not say?" 'Well, Mr. Ambassador, to be perfectly frank' it was about your mother, sir. My mother? What about my mother? Well, sir, he, uh, suggests that your mother maintained a close intimate relationship. Relationship? Yes, sir. With a camel. 'And after the camel killed itself in shame' 'your mother apparently took on the..' [screaming] [yelling] Sir! Sir, not here. Don't stop me! I'm alright. I am able to forgive this lack of basic civility because I am a gentleman and a Christian. A Unitarian, in fact. I'll return to the August Chambers when the distinguished representative is prepared to apologize for his inane remarks. If such a concept exists within the framework of his alleged culture. [thudding on door] Cute. Cute. [percussive music] [music continues] [speaking foreign language] [indistinct speaking] [speaking foreign language] [music continues] [indistinct speaking] [instrumental music] [tour guide] 'Move directly across the hall into the China Room' 'where you'll be able to see a display of tableware' 'used by various White House families.' 'Of course, that was Army Chief-of-Staff' 'Randall Dumpston.' 'Now, please, don't touch any of these' 'invaluable items of historical significance' 'and kindly refrain from sitting on the antique chairs' 'or walking on the premises..' Uh, good morning, general. Please inform Mr. Feebleman I'm here. Yes, sir. Uh, General Dumpston is here to, uh.. 'General. Excuse me. Just a minute. If I..' - Good morning, general. - ...to you, Quincy. Huh. What the hell happened at United Nations this mornin'? I assume you're talking about Ambassador Spender's failure to get a favorable vote in the Natural Resources council? Yeah, Ambassador Spender that Harvard-educated dimwit. He had a firm majority of one vote. He blew it because he lost control of a maniac wearin' a bed sheet. That vote is not conclusive. It can brought up again in the general council when and if Ambassador Spender feels-- What the hell is that? Uh, that is rope made out of sheets knotted together. I can see that, Feebleman. - Barbara. - 'Yes, sir?' Please inform security that Gloria is taking another shot at the wall. [Barbara] 'Right away, sir.' Now, as I was saying, general I assume you know that the ambassador from the newly emergent nation of Upper Gorm presented his credentials to the secretary general today. - Are you cognizant to the fact? - I'm cognant. - Upper Gorm is the key. - To what? See if you can follow me, general. You like to, uh, fly your planes, and sail your boats. - Ships. - Ships. I'm sorry. And operate your wonderful new sophisticated weapon systems. Well, in order to do that you need the following raw material. Titanium, manganese, tungsten beryllium, zinc and cobalt. - Are you listening, general? - Yeah, zinc, cobalt. Go on. In order to procure these items produced primarily in those African nations the names of which no one can seem to remember the president has put forward his well-publicized "Share and share alike" program. 'They send us the above mentioned material' we, in turn, provide them with liberal amounts of rayon Coca Cola syrup, musical instruments TV repair manuals costume jewelry and many many other very nice things. [Randall] 'Terrific.' 'But that program went down the tube' 'with the vote this morning.' [Feebleman] 'Here's the point.' The ambassador is arriving here this afternoon by special presidential invitation. So? According to the UN protocol, the ambassador takes a seat on the Natural Resources Council the Arab moves up to the committee on international monetary cooperation. 'Just keep goin'.' We have our swing vote. Now, what's to keep him from throwin' in with the rest of his buddies and giving us the well-known African shaft? We are going to roll out the red carpet. The President himself is going out to the airport to meet him and his group and then bring them all back here. [clattering] They're staying here? At the White House? That's right. After a brief tour of lovely downtown Washington. Trust me, Randy, we know what we're doing. We've got it all worked out. Alright. I'll go along with you on this one. We would appreciate that. We really would. Incidentally, what are you gonna be wearing tonight? What the hell are you talking about now? There'll be a gala affair here at the White House tonight in honor of Ambassador Longo. The ambassador requested a costume party. I'll be damned if I'll wear a costume. The theme of the evening is American holidays. 'Titanium, general.' Manganese and tungsten. Think tungsten. Sanctuary! Sanctuary! No, you.. [instrumental music] It arrives at 4:27. - What does? - The plane, Mr. President. The plane with Ambassador Longo inside of it. Thanks. No. No. Will you be wanting Press Secretary Bunthorne to handle this evening's affair in any special way with the press? Yes. Well, where is he? - Who, sir? - Press Secretary Bunthorne. Um.. - Right here, sir. - Good. Um, try to handle this, uh.. situation in the usual way, Bunny. Can I leak something? - Yes. - Can I confirm something? - Yes. - Can I deny something? Yes, yes, yes. Just, uh.. Try to make it look like we're glad to have a lot of-lot of black people in the-in the White House. Like we're, um.. Comfortable? Exactly. [exhales] Yeah. Yes. Yes. Thank you. Thank you. She, uh, she forgot her camera. [Constance] 'Thank you.' 'Thank you.' Are, uh, are you two going, uh going with me to the airport? No, sir. [Manfred] 'Does the commander have to go with me to the airport?' You know he does, sir. He has the code, sir. [Constance] 'Thank you.' [no audio] - 'Thank you.' - She's coming. - Whoa! Look out. - Oh. [Constance] 'Thank you.' She's alright. She's alright. [instrumental music] [music continues] Washington. Washington? [Spender] 'Yes.' [snaps finger] [speaking foreign language] I'm sorry? [speaking foreign language] Say, pachu-man-chika. "Chu-jo, pachu-ju, pachu-lab, chu-man.. Here we are, pachu-man-chika. "A complex term leading to the appeasement "of the Gormese divinity Chi "the deity responsible for the safety of travelers in the form of human sacrifice." Sacrifice? [door opens] [wind gusting] [door closes] [thudding] [airplane whirring] [instrumental music] [camera shutter clicks] [music continues] [music continues] Mr. Ambassador, I.. [African percussive music] [music continues] It is, uh, it is so good of you to, uh, to visit us here in Washington on such short notice. Oh, I'm sorry. This is Mrs. Link. For you. May I have peas instead of beans? Yes. I, uh, I trust, your President Kalundra is in good health. Thank you. I'd rather walk to school in the morning. Uh-huh. Well, uh.. We're-we're actually like you to say a few words to the-to the greeting party. Thank you. My gums are swollen. My-- [mike screeches] Just, just a second. What the hell is this? They threw one out of the plane. What in the hell is he talking about? Pachu-man-chika,sir. Pachu-man-chika. What in the hell are you talking about? He must've landed around here somewhere. Spender, I'm asking you a question. The bath water is too hot in January. What in the Christ's name is he babbling about? Oh, well, he seems to have learned a little English he knows from a phrase book. He doesn't make any sense, Spender. Yes, sir, he seems to have memorized phrases somewhat arbitrarily. What about the others? [speaking foreign language] Hello. Hello. Do, uh, any of them speak English? No, sir. What you're telling me is what we have here is a bunch of very important visitors with whom we must communicate on some very vital matters of international interest. And we are stuck after we say, "Hello." Is that about the size of it? I don't it's quite that severe a problem, sir. You don't. Ambassador Longo. Up your ass. That sweater is too expensive. You don't consider that severe? - Manfred, what is this-- - Go away. Yes, sir. Yes. How did you get them this far? One hundred handy Upper Gormese phrases. Who compiled this? We're trying to track him down now, sir. We believe he's somewhere in Washington working in computer research. - Get him. - Yes, sir. Oh, this, uh.. This is a beautiful box. No, dear. Oh. Well, this, this is very nice. It's a-it's a rock. It's a very nice rock. [speaking Gormese] How's-how's that? [shouting in Gormese] Uh-huh. Well, uh, okay. I-I would like you to, um.. ...to ride, ride 'with me to the White..' White, White, uh, House. [airplane passing] It's being handled, sir. The church be open until precisely 12:00 midnight. [Manfred] 'Yes. Yes indeed.' [device beeping] [instrumental music] Is this your first visit to Washington, Mr. Ambassador? It is forbidden to piss against the wind. I am very happy to hear that. Oh. [indistinct screaming] [head clatters] [screams] [glass shatters] [siren wailing] [horn honking] [Alexander] 'Goodnight.' - 'Goodnight, Dr. Grade.' - Goodnight. Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight. Goodnight, Dr. Grade. Goodnight. - Goodnight, Alexander. - Goodnight. Goodnight. Uh, goodnight. Goodnight. - Good evening. - Good evening. [Spender] 'Dr. Alexander Grade, your country needs you.' Ah. Oh, I'm so.. Look alive, young man. This is it. Sir, what is, sir? You are about to meet the president of the United States. [exhales] Mr. President? [indistinct chatter] No pictures. No pictures. Hey, hey. No pictures. Alright, boys. There's no TV tonight. Turn 'em off, boys. Turn 'em off. Okay, I've got some material for you, yes. Tell me, uh.. Why was this morning's press briefing canceled? Okay, let me be perfectly frank with you on that one. This morning's briefing was not canceled it was simply not held. [indistinct chatter] What is he talking about? Now, there'll be no inside coverage of tonight's banquet. But guest lists and menus will be disseminated. - Hey, give me one there. - Oh, give me two. And there's a special surprise. We're going to give you out here a few minutes with Ambassador Longo. And I think you should be real appreciative of this one. And President Link himself. [indistinct murmuring] [cameras clicking] [clears throat] Ladies and gentleman of the press, it is my privilege to present the ambassador to the United Nations from the lovely Island Republic of Upper Gorm. [applause] Oh.. May I? "Ah-uh, greetings. "Greetings to the American people "from the president of my country. "The honorable Mazai, Mazai Kalundra. "It is to the eternal honor of the people of the Upper Gorm "to join with her new friend the United States in affairs of, uh-- [speaking Gormese] [stuttering] - "Mutual advantage." - Yes. "Uh, uh, which will be discussed when her great leader "President Link and his family will visit our country next week." What? "We give our assurances that all amenities will be "accorded to your great leader and-and, uh, his lovely family. '"And we solemnly give our promise' no to eat them." What? [clamor] Hawa-tunee. Hawa-tunee. Ah! Oh. Oh. A joke. The ambassador was making a hawa-tunee. Um, a joke. And-and a-a very amusing hawa-tunee. [speaking Gormese] [both chuckling] Uh, the hawa-tunee. Uh, did that have to do with the "Eat them" part? That was a hawa-tunee,sir. Yes. Hmm. And how about the going to Gorm part? That was not a hawa-tunee,sir. Spender.. [reporters clamoring] [whistling] [whistling] [whistling] [all whistling] [instrumental music] [applause] [instrumental music] Uh, ask the ambassador if he'd care to sample one of our fine domestic wines. [speaking foreign language] Sir, sir, the ambassador says that he would be pleased if you in turn would like a taste of the traditional Upper Gormese national drink. And an excellent gesture of mutual inter-ethnic appreciation. [speaking foreign language] Chapelle Chardonnay '76. [speaking foreign language] Hmm, donkey blood. Um, and cow urine, August. [instrumental music] [indistinct chatter] Is the president in there? Yes, sir. What's he doing? Sir, this is the bathroom. I am aware of that fact. This is an emergency. What's he doing in there? - 'Sir!' - Is it la-la or chi-chi? We don't know, sir. Then find out. - Mr. President. - 'What is it?' Sorry to bother you, sir. Ambassador Spender wants to know whether you're making.. "La-la" or "chi-chi." [Manfred] 'Spender.' Mr. President, we have a problem. Yes, sir. [Spender] 'Sir, I think we should assemble' 'the National Security Council immediately.' - 'In here?' - 'Not in here, of course.' Gentlemen, a situation has arisen concerning Upper Gorm. And Dr. Grade, oh, Dr. Grade, before we begin I'd like to introduce you to the council members. Uh, Special Presidential Assistant, Feebleman. - My pleasure, doctor. - How do you do, sir? Press Secretary, Bunthorne. Oh, I think we've met. We just met. Good to see you again, doc. It's good to see you, sir. Attorney General, Spot. How do you do, sir? Willie O'Malley, the director of the CIA and I might add, a grand honor. Hey, how's it going? Oh, fine, sir. How is it going with you, Willie? - And Vice President, Shockley. - Of course. - How do you do? - How do you do, sir? I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name. - Alexander Grade. - Grade, yes. Grade is right. Secretary of Defense, Springfield. Good to have you aboard, son. Sir, how are you? And over here, we have Secretary of State, Reigle. - Of course. - Do you speak English? - Yes, I do. - So I'd love you. And Military Chief of staff, General Dumpston. Sir. And of course, you already know the chief. Yes, yes, indeed. This is such a thrill to me. Please, I-I, this is the-- Gentlemen, please, please sit down. Oh, oh. I.. Gentlemen, I'll try to make this as simple as possible. As you know, we desperately need the Upper Gormese vote in the United Nations. Ambassador Spender assures me, we have that vote. This evening however, Ambassador Longo announced to the press that his country was expecting a formal visit from me, your president and my lovely family, next week. He did this without consultation and without warning. Do you get the picture? It's totally unacceptable. We're talking Pearl Harbor. Absolutely shocking. We don't have to take that kind of crap from anyone. Now, I would like to point out that we are moving into an election situation. We can't afford to have you out of the country. - Yes. Very good. - True. I have to add one or two more pieces of information. This afternoon.. ...Ambassador Longo.. ...gave me this. Hmm. Looks like a rock. Dr. Grade, do you have any information on this? Oh, yes, well, sir, according to Ambassador Longo the junk was extracted at random from Jucama. - Jucama? - Oh, yes, sir. Jucama is the name of the mountain 'which comprises a large part of their island' 'and which is actively volcanic in nature.' And, uh, it's sacred. - 'It's scared?' - Yes, sir. They...well, they worship it. That rock has an extremely high uranium content. Uranium? - That's right. Uranium 238. - 238? What about the aerial photographs, Spender? Yes, sir. Well, the Air Force just brought them in. So the analysis has been necessarily hasty. Now, if you'll look at your copies, you'll see that certain sections have been circled. Those sections are hot-spots. Hot-spots? Is there an echo in here? Echo? Go on, Spender. Well, these areas are giving off some kind of energy. Now, air intelligence suspects that these large, spherical and curving tunnel-shaped forms are the top of some sort of underground structure suggestive of a massive power complex. And I'm really sure what that means, but.. You mean, these Gormese people have.. Say it, general. ...nuclear capacity? We wish we knew. Well, sir. Do you wanna know what I think? [Manfred] 'Does anyone want to know what a vice president thinks?' 'Those are the facts, gentlemen.' In light of this new information and with firm beliefs that any compromise on our part would demonstrate great moral weakness how many of you feel that I, your president should even consider giving into this case of appalling international blackmail? [instrumental music] [screaming] It's not my fault I'm the vice president. I didn't pick me. He did. God knows, I was perfectly happy in Congress. I was on a lot of swell committees and I got the vote on a lot of things. And-and I answered quorum.. and I took part in the biggest.. Gee, I had fun. You are trying to tell us that you've never thought about being president now, are you, Will? Not even a little? Not even a teeny-weeny bit? Are you kidding? President? Presidents don't have any fun. I mean, gee, they're always getting shot at or-or impeached or reviled. Ooh, it's terrible. Then why didn't you refuse the nomination? I didn't want people to think I was a sissy. Here are the new messages that the president recorded last night for emergency broadcast in case of enemy action during his absence. This is Signal Yellow. My fellow Americans we're about to undergo an enemy assault. We have approximately one hour to activate our military and civil defense procedures. Good luck to all of you. This is Signal Orange. This is your president speaking. Aerial bombardment is eminent. Do the best you can and may God be with you. What about Signal Red? We're not entirely happy with that one yet. It's a tricky message to deliver considering that it will proceed a nuclear missile attack by only 20 or 30 seconds. Oh, let's hear of what you've got so far. Th-th-that's all folks. Too frivolous? Mr. President, beloved members of the first family ladies and gentlemen, honored guests. I'm Father Reggie Sandstone, okay? First pastor of the first church of the rude awakening over in Louis, Virginia. [speaking foreign language] I mean, look at them. 'Our beloved first family.' Beautiful human beings, every last one of them are going to get into that machine up there and they are going to trust in something. 'I don't care what you call it.' 'God or Buddha' 'or the light force or just good old karma.' Something that keep them from falling out of the sky and smashing into the ground in a pile of twisted metal and mango blends. And you know what I call that? I call that, guts and love in equal parts. You know it. And I look at them as I'm looking at them 'right now and I say to myself' "Hey, baby, that's one first family that really got it's shit together." [speaking foreign language] So it can't hurt for us to lay a few good vibes on them. To let them have their own real space to be in for all of us. For all of us here. Black, white, gay, straight carnivores, vegetarians, whatever. Because they're doing it for us. For all of us here in this greatest grandest and grooviest of nations where every man or woman is free to form a tax exempt, non-profit corporation and trade the revealed word of the creator for the material benefits of American life.. [speaking foreign language] That's excellent. That's 24. Can I get you something? Can I get you anything? Excuse me, sir, your coffee. Thank you. Anyway, we better try that word again, sir. That word. - Chara jojo. - No, no. Chara jojo. The accent is on the final syllable. Chara jojo. What the hell is the difference? Sir, "chara jojo" means "thank you." And "chara jojo" means, roughly.. ...bite the tree. Grade, I'm never gonna get the hang of this language. I flunked Spanish in high school. And my God, even Mexicans know how to speak Spanish. [Grade] 'That's true, sir.' Oh, and of course, in Gormese they don't make any distinction at all between a noun and a verb. For instance, their word for snake can indicate a past snake, a present snake or a future snake depending on the juxtaposition of diphthongs.. ...within the word itself. Let me tell you something. I have too much to remember now. I've to think about Gorm's national product. I've to think about foreign price supports. I've to think about military appropriations the cost of indexes. And future snakes? It's-it's-it's too much. Oh, I know, sir. You have too much to worry about. And I think it would be a good idea if you got some sleep. Can't sleep. [Grade] 'Sir?' Dreams. Dreams. Are you bothered by dreams, sir? Listen to this, kid. When I was your age.. ...I used to have all these big dreams. I go to sleep and.. ...hit a home run with three men on.. ...discover boxes of rubies.. '...low down Nazi troops..' ...bang movie stars. Once I protected a blind newspaper boy from six giant hoods. Just my quick fists and my bare wits. [exhales] Those were the nights. [Grade] 'Those are really fine dreams, sir.' Not anymore. You wanna know what do I dream now? What, sir? I dream.. ...in the White House dining room.. ...when I sit down.. ...and there's a bowl of soup. Clear soup. Bouillon or something. And I pick up my soup spoon.. ...and I eat my clear soup. Yes, sir. That's it. I eat it. I don't burn my tongue horribly. They don't find a dead spider with legs, like my sister floating in the bottom of the bowl. No witch doesn't come through the wall and scares the crap out of me. I just, I eat my bowl of clear soup.. ...and I wake up. What do you think it means? I don't know, sir. You've ever heard of a dream that doesn't mean anything? No, sir. I don't think so. Where are the dreams of yesteryear? I just don't know, sir. [squeaking] [gasping] [engine whirring] [Captain] 'Good morning. This is your captain speaking.' 'We're on our final approach' 'to Upper Gorm's international airport' 'which consists I'm sorry to say' 'of a large clay hut and a short dirt runway.' 'The landing maybe a little bit bumpy' 'but according to our State Department' 'information manual' 'you'll soon be enjoying Upper Gorm's' 'natural scenic splendor' 'carefree island beauty' 'and hearty native cuisine.' [instrumental music] [hens clucking] Which one of them is the head boogie man? I am the head boogie man. Which one of you is the chief turkey? [instrumental music] [squawking] [music continues] One of the things that I have always regretted is that we do not see more uh, black people in the White House. I mean, we, we, we see them but we do not...see them. If you know what I mean, but the one's that we do see are so.. Uh, they are so well-mannered. They are pleasant and, and they're so appreciative. And when they get dressed up my, my, they look so, so nice. [music continues] [ululating] [speaking foreign language] [laughing] [speaking foreign language] [all laughing] [speaking foreign language] [music continues] I hope Mr. President that you are not too bored with our modest attempt at entertainment. No, no, I've, uh, I've always been interested in, in, native, uh...things. Hmm, if there are any questions.. I was, I was wondering, uh, h-how you learned to-to speak English so good. Uh, so, so well. My father, the late dictator of our beloved island who saw the time when it would become necessary to establish some contact with the outside world. He sent me across the great water to study. Great...the great water? Hmm, yes. All the way to the University of Miami. It was there I learned your language. - Great seat of learning. - Yes. [flute music] [ululating] [instrumental music] Better be something big. Yes. What better be big? This deal, whatever it is you're talking about. We better go back with something dramatic. Something...big? Yeah. Yeah. Let us come now, right to the point of your visit, Mr. President. Fine. Uh, you want our vote in the United Nations. Yes? Well, but, uh, it would certainly be helpful. Mhm, and why do you remain somewhat in the dark so to speak about, uh, what it is that we want. Go on. We have a healthy, hard working population. We are ancient in noble religious traditions. Strong economy, splendid climate. In fact, we have all the requirements of a superstate but one. And what is that? Well, can't you guess what it is? No. A repressed minority. What? We are prepared to purchase from you at a reasonable price several hundred, middle class White Americans. Of various religions, ages and, uh, occupations. As you might, uh, say in your country a mixed bag of honkeys. Uh, we would see to it that they were comfortably settled here. And then subject them to their proper amount of division and contempt and deny them certain basic rights. And in general.. ...give them the dirty end of the stick. What do you say? Uh, t-this is an utterly incredible proposition. Oh, ho, ho, I can't imagine that you would miss a few hundred average American families. I'm sure you would think of something to tell your constituency. I can't even imagine what I.. ...what I would tell my, my own lovely family? Oh, please, Mr. President let us not be too hypocritical. Your lovely family consists primarily of a wife who drinks too much and a daughter who.. My daughter happens to be a virgin. [volcano erupting] Are you seriously trying to tell me that your daughter has never.. Absolutely never. Goodnight, Mr. President. Goodnight, Mr. President. [speaking foreign language] Do as I say. There is, there is nothing. Absolutely.. [indistinct chatter] Gloria, I really don't think you should just wander off like this. Don't you ever, wish you could just throw off all your clothes and run on all fours, through the woods with nothing but your hot, hot blood rushing through all your arteries? Well, n-not on all fours. - Alexander.. - Yes, Gloria. Look in my eyes, what do you see? Well.. You see a woman. The woman's needs and a woman's dreams and all the rest of that stuff, don't you? Yes, I do. You see a deeply feeling human being looking for fulfillment. And there's that, too. So why don't we just sort of cease the moment if you know what I mean? - Gloria.. - Alone in the jungle. In the moonlight and pounding drums and all that junk, you know. - Yeah, but-- - Naked and not ashamed. Gloria.. Okay. Here's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna go over to that tree and I'm gonna wait until you collect yourself and put your shoes back on. 'And then I'm gonna take you to your family.' And we're gonna forget that this ever happened. Are there no men left on this Earth! [intense music] [instrumental music] [music continues] Gloria! Please, Dr. Grade, control yourself. Miss Link has been chosen for a greater destiny than anything she or you could've dreamed. She is to become the bride of Jucamba. [volcano erupting] Jucamba is ready. [instrumental music] [music continues] [volcano erupting] [ululating] [Constance] 'Gloria. Gloria.' 'What can we do to erase this hideous' this, oh, this nightmare? Oh, my.. Oh, my baby. Look at you. My dear, Mr. President, if there is any way we can make up for this inconvenience. In...Inconvenience? You, you used my daughter for some kind of depraved ritual and, and you call it an inconvenience? Oh, but you must try to understand. This is not just some fly by night ceremony. This is the big time. Like your rosebush. Why in God's name didn't you use one of your virgins? Well, frankly, we've almost run out. [chuckles] And, uh, between you and me.. ...he's never had a foreigner. He was overcome with delight. Overcome! Thanks to Miss Link, we look forward to an extremely prosperous year. Do you actually think that there can be some connection bet-between this this grotesque practice and in a, in a smoothly functioning economy? Well, look at it this way. In your country, you raise and lower the prime lending rate. In my country, we sacrifice a virgin. This is the 20th century. Yes. And it still works. I-I can't believe my ears. Well ,then my dear, Mr. President perhaps you can believe your eyes. Are you interested in fertilizer? Ours is the best in the world. It is, as you might say, super-fertilizer. It is incredibly rich in potassium phosphorus and sulphur. [instrumental music] [random chatter in Manfred's mind] [random chatter] It is with great pleasure that I present The Nobel Prize for chemistry and peace. [random mind chatter] [instrumental music] [man on TV] 'Good evening, tonight's Washington reports' 'deals with President Link's diplomatic mission' 'to Upper Gorm.' 'Since his return, some ten days ago' 'the president has held himself in virtual seclusion.' 'Spending almost all of his time by himself in the Oval Office.' 'Working on next Sunday's schedule' 'to address to the nation.' 'Pausing only for a few hours sleep, a light meal' and now and then, according to Press Secretary Bunthorne an uncontrollable giggle. [indistinct chatter] 'Chief's executive journey to that small island' 'off the coast of Africa, have been rebuffed' 'by both White House staff members' 'and presidential entities.' 'Of all the assumption that can safely be made' 'and some sort of understanding' 'has been reached between the two governments.' Shh! Listen. It is assumed that the president will deliver his speech from this remote military base in Minnesota for sentimental reasons. Since it is within a few miles of the farm 'on which he was born.' 'What is less explicable is the..' With him over there in that Godforsaken place. Don't you have any idea what this is about? He won't talk to us. Oh, he does his smile knowingly. Like this.. - Oh, it scares me. - When he smiles like that? No, when you smile like that, I hate it. Maybe he's having a nervous breakdown. Of course he's having a nervous breakdown. All presidents have nervous breakdowns. That's why they all look like that. Um, can't the CIA do anything? They certainly don't want to do anything illegal. - Ahem. - Oh, Bill. If we could only get a look at that treaty.. It would do absolutely no good. It's written entirely in Gormese. Shh, wait a minute. Meanwhile, special crews from the department of agriculture are working around the clock 'under direct orders from the White House.' 'In an apparent effort to beautify the nation's capital' 'in time for the upcoming election. Here at the..' The government's falling apart he's got them planting flowers, for God's sakes. What's he doin'? Well, I asked him about that. - What did he say? - Please don't do that. [man on TV] 'And although the subject, the chief executive's speech..' Shh! Shh! Listen! '...secrecy, it will include' 'according to our White House sources' one of the most dramatic announcements to come out of the government since last year when Supreme Court Justice Benjamin Barstow President Link's only High Court appointee 'revealed that he had undergone a sex change operation' 'at the Doppelmayr clinic.' 'Taken the first name of Beatrice' 'and given up his widely publicized hobby' 'of mountain climbing for macrame.' Which the nation's first semi-female Supreme Court.. Gentlemen, let us not forget that whatever happens out there on that field on Sunday the eyes of the country will be upon us. Our party is at stake. Our government, our nation. Even more important.. [all] Our jobs. [instrumental music] That, sir? Is that Mr. Longo? Take over. [all coughing] [engine revving] [Manfred] 'My fellow Americans..' ...in my inaugural address to you almost four long high, work filled years ago I made a solemn promise. That promise was that I would commit every ounce of my time and energy to gain for our country the biggest and the best of everything. 'My administration is yet to bear the burden' 'the past decade was shrinking resources.' Shrinking supplies of energy. Shrinking productivity. Shrinking.. ...shrink...shrank.. ...shrunk. 'I was a, uh, boy..' Ah, here it is. Here is the treaty. [tires screeching] Start translating, Dr. Grade. Oh, sir, I don't think-- We're not asking you to think we're asking you to translate. And I, I walked to school across the, the very ground on which we stand now. And I, I had a dog and he, he walked along with me to school. But he, but he died. He was a saint, that dog. And he.. He went to doggy heaven. 'And I miss him.' Well, what? - I miss him very much. - You're really getting to me. But because I was, uh, a little boy l-like all little boys and-and all little girls, too, I guess everything seemed so big. Buildings were big. And furniture.. ...silver dollars.. ...and this cigar my dad used to smoke. And clouds.. ...and, and women's breasts were big. Breasts? Why is he talking about breasts, for Pete's sake? Sir, we're giving them people. - I'm sorry. W-What do you say? - 1500 people. [Manfred] 'And then, and then I grew up.' 'And every, everything seemed to shrink.' 'Almost before your eyes.' 'till everything was s-so small and' 'so tiny.' [engine revs] But not anymore, my fellow Americans. Not with this. This, this treaty signed and executed by me, your president.. Oh, hold it, sir. "They have given us 20,000 gallons.." Gallons? ...in tailing a minimum of sacrifice on your part.. ...on, on part of your parts in exchange for the contents of this tank.. Gallons of what? [Manfred] 'This tank..' Shit. '...beneath which I sold thousand acres..' Shit! Shit! [engine revs] ...will give us back our business. I see vast fields.. [tires squealing] ...and in, in those fields I see sweet peas as big as beach balls. I see, I see kidney beans as big as armchairs. Stalks of celery like telephone poles. 'Giant purple figs like domes of Muslim temple' and, and potatoes as, as large as Volkswagens. - President, I.. - Mr. President. Please, stop him. Stop him! I can see a cantaloupe 'that will not only feed a family of four for a year' 'but house them as well!' 'Rhubarb taller than pine trees.' [indistinct chatter] [car revving] Because I can see all-- Dad! [engine revving] [all screaming] [groaning] My hand.. Oh. [clatter] [McDonald] 'This special secret session of the Supreme Court' 'in private chambers is now in order.' Please be seated. Justice Barstow. Beatrice. Beatrice? Hat. Hat. You may proceed, Mr. Ambassador. [Spender] 'Well, thank you very much. Ahem.' Mr. Chief Justice. Mr. Justices. Madam Justice. What we are seeking here is the advice of the court on the possibility of some sort of remedy for this extremely painful situation. [McDonald] 'Well, Mr. Spender' I'm sure you are familiar with the provisions in the constitution for removal of the president from office. Well, uh, not in any great detail, sir. You see, by profession I am a history teacher. A professor? No, uh, an associate professor. Well, Mr. Feebleman being a lawyer, perhaps you have some opinion? Uh, Mr. Chief Justice uh, I'm afraid that the bulk of my legal experience has been in insurance law. Uh, traffic accidents, things like that. I have, uh, worked mainly with ambulance drivers-- I, I see. I see. Thank you. 'What about you, Mr.Bunthorne?' I was in public relations, sir, for the fuss. For what? For the, um.. ...funhouse, sir in Coney Island. I see. Thank you. I would like to address the particulars of this treaty with the Upper Gormese. Oh, yes, sir. A treaty drawn up without the advice and, or consent of the senate, I believe. Yes, sir, but I for one knew absolutely nothing about it. I had no idea what was in that treaty. I would've advised against it if anybody had asked me. [McDonald] 'Gentlemen, the point is' that if the American people ever find out about this treaty-- Uh, fortunately, sir, they don't have to. [McDonald] 'What do you mean, Mr. Spender?' Well, you see, the television transmission concluded when the platform was...accidently demolished before the details of the treaty could be revealed. You see, actually, all that people know was that there was a mishap of some sort-- Uh, you mean, as far as everybody outside this room is concerned Mr. Link and his family might be.. Yes, sir. [indistinct murmuring] - You agree? - Yeah. [McDonald] 'Mr. President' it is the decision of this body that in order to save this nation 'from the embarrassment of a long and painful impeachment' 'and in the interest of preserving' 'the good name of your office' and of protecting all of us from the scorn and derision of the outside world 'we now...pronounce you..' '...dead.' [instrumental music] Would you raise your right hand? Would you raise your right hand? You may lower your left hand. Please repeat after me. - I, William Shockley. - I.. I hope we get away with this. Do faithfully swear.. To uphold the office of the president of the United States Ahem, do faithfully swear to uphold the office ahem, of president of t-the.. [groaning] I, uh...oh.. No, no.. Do faithfully swear.. Do faithfully swear.. ...to uphold the office.. ...to uphold the office.. ...of the president of the United States.. - Presi, pres.. - President. President of the United States.. I, uh.. I.. [gasping] 'Oh, my gosh.' There's no.. There's no pulse. [man on TV] 'And so once again, within the space of a few days' 'the nation mourns another fallen leader.' 'Struck down according to White House physicians' by a fatal heart attack brought on by the burdens of his high office. Political experts agree that the late President Shockley will receive high marks for his command of the ship of state even though he was at its helm for little more than five or six seconds. 'And now with the November general elections' 'almost upon us, the heads of the late president's party' 'must begin a frantic search for a new candidate.' 'In other news from Washington' groups of local citizens and tourists alike are gathering at the site of what can only be described as some kind of agricultural miracle. 'Special investigators from Food and Drug Administration' 'are at a total loss to explain the sudden appearance' 'at this and other monuments' 'a bizarre, organic, possibly edible forms' 'some of them, according to one eye witness' 'resembling potatoes as large as small foreign cars.' 'People have been gathering all day' 'at all these monuments and other sites around Washington..' Excuse me, please. [indistinct chatter] [man on radio] 'This is...base standing by for security report' 'on the perimeter, over.' Yeah, this is Gunderson on lookout three. 'I've got a clear all on all four compass points, over.' [indistinct chatter] 'You betcha.' I can see a Nobel Prize in your future, sir. Mr. President, Mr. President. I can predict an overwhelming majority at the polls. Manny, we've already opened negotiations with the Upper Gormese for an exclusive trade agreement. I want a lot more vacations. - Yes, sir! - Naturally, sir! - Aah! - Uh-oh. I, I want to remodel the White House. I, I wanna make it more homey. Why not. I wanna put a statue in the Rose Garden. A lovely idea. - A really big statue. - 'Gloria.' - With a real big-- - Gloria! And...of course, we'll need.. ...virgins. Virgins, sir? Approximately one a year. For the sacrifice. - Yes. - We'll have a national contest. Yes! Wait a minute. They think I'm dead. Yes. Yes. [Bunthorne] 'How, h-how do we..?' - Yes! - Aah! This will be the greatest sales pitch in the history of American political campaigns. Once, every 2000 years or so a man of vision a man who can work miracles returns to lead his people. [Constance laughing] You don't really think that that a-anyone would would believe that? [crowd cheering] [marching band music] Welcome back, Mr. President! [crowd cheering] [music continues] [crowd cheering] [music continues] [music continues] [crowd cheering] [music continues]
