- Subtitles - Lu?s Filipe Bernardes I love you! Oh, I could have eloped years ago. - Boy, I gotta... - Hello, Steve! Hello, Stevie boy! - For the groom. - That's for you, you lughead! A little token of esteem... from the boys. A little token of rum right back at you, Charlie. How about it, Jeff? Shall we dip the beat to the absent bride? - Absolutely! - Good. A bit of bitters to a bit of beauty. Uh... we hope. - Oh, now, wait a minute, Jeff. - What? I don't want you mugs to think this is just a moonlight ride. You see, Elaine and I grew up together in a little town in Texas. Fell in love at her mud pile and we've been that way ever since. - What, in mud piles? - No, sir, in love! Sure, I was gonna quit college when her dad moved the family to England. But no, "Finish school, Steve," she said, "I'll still be waiting." That's the kind of a girl she is. You know, with one word that girl can turn my insides upside down... ...and make them spell Thursday. Yeah, no kidding, on the level. She wrote to me every day, and before every big game, a cablegram. He made it All-American halfback by cablegram. Maybe I did at that. When Jeff gave me that job on the Record... I thought sure I'd be able to get married then, but oh, no. Not a chance on that pay. Well, that's gratitude. Last week when Jeff needed a manager for the London office, he gave me the job and I and I cabled to her... ...and she cabled right back at me to come on, and am I doing it? Oh, boy, you don't find them like that every day. Oh, Jeff, she's marvelous, she's wonderful. Well, I just wanted you to know. Young man taking himself seriously wants to be taken seriously. That would give a nice story. Alright, Rollo, my boy, and no fooling this time, you mugs. Love to Elaine. - Oh, you gotta rub it harder than that. - I beg your pardon, sir? Look, rub it till it growls, like this. - Please, sir, don't knock, sir. They're not up yet. What is it, sir? Tell Miss Elaine a man is here for her trunks. Trunks? What trunks? Trunks she's is going away with me in. - Did you hear anything about any trunks? - I didn't know she was going away. We don't know nothing about no trunks. Miss Elaine ain't going away. I says we don't know nothing about no trunks. Just tell her Romeo is here. - Romeo? - Hm-hmm. Romeo. Miss Elaine. Romeo's here. - Romeo? - He said he was Romeo. All right. Sweetheart! Stevie. Oh, am I glad to see you, honey. I don't know what to say to you, I... - Wait. - Wait? - I've waited 37.000 years for this. - Please, I'm trying to tell you. I'm married. Oh, honey, don't joke about anything like this. It's true, Stevie. I was married Tuesday. I wrote you I'd met him. Don't you remember? Leonard Brandon. Yes, but what's he, what's anybody compared to those years we planned together? Oh, I know, dear. Please don't look like that. I don't understand it myself. The minute I saw him, everything else evaporated like little bursting bubbles. Yes, but your letters. You said you'd be waiting. You can't expect me to believe anything like this, Elaine, it's not possible. I can't explain it, dear. Please, Stevie. I see it all now. I'm just a clunk. I ought to have known. I didn't belong. Gimme a whisky. - Will you have a drink? - Yes, governor. - Water? - Yeah. Whoa! Good health, governor. We're friends of Joe's. You know, we were here last week. Go on in. Good night, Mac. Well, hello, Rollo! Hello, Jeff! - How are you? - Hi, I'm glad to see you! Am I glad to see you. I just heard you were back in New York. - Yeah, did the colonel tell you? - Yes, he's been celebrating your return. Told me to meet you at Petroni's. Left me with a special edition of the paper to get out. I'll fire that guy one of these days. What's this about your sailing again in the morning? Yeah, in fact, the Argentine this time. You're an awful liar, Rollo, you're gonna stay right here in New York and go back to work on the Record. No, not after the way I gummed things up in London. Oh, think nothing of it, my boy. When you didn't show up at the London office, the circulation doubled. Well, I guess it's goodbye, Aubrey. I can't believe it, Mary. How will I get along without you? I don't see how I can go through with this. Isn't there some way I can back out? Mrs. Whitney's waiting downstairs in the car, sir. I'm afraid it's too late. Oh, it's the thing to do, Aubrey. Married to Mrs. Whitney you'll have opportunity, fame... - Oh, yes... - What you've always dreamed of. What's that without you, running up from the shop with coffee? To listen to some goofy tune, to kid me out of the blues. I've taken you too much as a matter of course, Mary. Oh, it's the only way to take this funny old world, darling. No blood, no sentiment, nothing counts. Just a lot of little episodes tied together. I never realized until tonight how much I depended on you. Oh, what can I do for you? You're a great pianist, Aubrey. I know it. But married to Mrs. Whitney... ...the world will know it. Yes. And next week I'd trade it all for a minute with you at that fire. I thought you were just the girl downstairs, Mary, but you're not. And that's all I ever could be. I don't belong in your world. Do you think I belong in her world? I'm afraid of it. Afraid of everything without you. Mary, I... I won't even know how to walk down that aisle tonight... - ...without you there to tell me. - Oh. You just put your left foot first and be sure to stop when you get to the altar. No, no, no, please. I'm trying to tell you I love you. Yes, I know. I've loved you too. Terribly, for ages. But let's make it goodbye with a smile. Mary. This can't be goodbye. She's waiting. # The train is standing in the station # # I love you # Hey, that's enough, that's enough. You guys are driving me back to work. Are you leaving before the check's paid? Very impolite. Do you think a newspaper publishes itself? Well, just let me know if I can do anything, Cook a little chicken broth so the kiddy's off to school? I wonder why I don't fire you? Don't waste your time, I wouldn't work for anybody else. - Oh, you mug. - Well, I'd better put his old paper to bed. Yeah. Your wife wants to talk to you on the phone, sir. Colonel E.B Fillwater, Record reporter... ...found unconscious in telephone booth with punctured eardrums. Well, Jeff, I guess you'll have to put the paper to bed yourself. Yeah, I've been doing that for years. Well, how about it, Rollo, coming to work for me tomorrow? No, not me. I'm gonna be on that old boat when she pulls out at dawn. - I gotta keep moving. - Now wait a minute, Rollo. Go on to work, you big mug, I'll meet you at the pier. I'm too busy to take a job. Mending that broken heart of yours, huh? Wiring it together just because one girl threw you over. Now, listen, Rollo, there are millions of nice girls in the world. - Where? - Why, everywhere. There's one. She doesn't belong in here. - She's a nice girl. I'll bet you. - All right, I'll bet you. Why don't you go over and ask her? I wouldn't listen if she came over and told me. - It's no use, Jeff, I'm a one-girl man. - I know, I know. All right, I'll meet you at the pier. - So long. - So long, Jeff. Suppose you were sitting where I'm sitting? Watching a beautiful girl. Can't you see how it would be a temptation? - Did you say beautiful girl? - I did. I need to be lied to tonight. All right, I'll come over and lie to you. I suppose I'll be safe. - So safe. - Not risking my reputation? - Have you one? - Oh, sure. I make it a point to be seen only with nice girls. - Are you a nice girl? - Oh, yes, me very nice girl. Hm-hmm. Of course, finding you here alone... Understand it doesn't mean a thing to me one way or another. Just trying to find out whether I win a dime or lose a dime on a bet. You win a dime. This is the first time, sir, I've ever been here unchaperoned. Uh-huh. Well, about this chaperone, um... Is he away or... likely to pop in? He's very much away. And I'm very much alone. I'm just here celebrating a wedding. - His? - Uh-huh. St. Bartholomew's, 8 o'clock... sharp. Well, what do you know about that? I've been celebrating the same kind of a wedding for a year. Is that funny? Well... it is funny, isn't it? - Sure, a year ago last Tuesday. - Oh, that's a shame. No more Valentines for you then. No more Valentines, no more letters, just a lot of no mores. Hm. Say, tell me. H-How long did it take you to get over it? - Oh, you never get over it. - I was afraid of that. Just shrug the well-known shoulders and go on, hm? If you can go on. You're doing a grand job of cheering me up. Well, I'm afraid I'm not the boy to help you much. - See, this all reminds me... - Yes, it reminds me too. I hate blurbs. But I'm entitled to wanting to cry. Guess I'll go home and try it. Do you mind if I go along and cry with you? Well, that ought to be a laugh. Tony. Tell the colonel I've borrowed his car. Tell him to meet me at the boat. Yes, sir, I will. Well, it stopped raining. And the moon's out. - And it's a swell night for a cry. - Hm-hmm. Swell night for a cry. I guess that's the colonel's over there. Yep, it's the colonel's all right. Just lean over and fall forward. - Where to, milady? - Flatbush, milord. I always wanted to cry in Flatbush. It's a grand country to cry in. Hey, that's my car, hey, where are you going with that car? Hey, come back here! Hey! Hey, officer... a man and a girl just stole my car. - An Austin, just like that one. - Did the driver retaliate? - They drove it, I saw them. - Where to? They went down there and around the corner. An Austin stole, Joe, West 48th St., going North on the Avenue. Here, here's the license number. License number 1L664. - What's that? - Sounds like a fire. - I'm crazy about fires. - Me too, big ones. Hey, you, pull over there. - What are the charges? - This is the pair with the stolen car. What do you mean stolen? - Any the other charges, Mulligan? - Speeding and transporting liquor. You two married? - We aren't married, are we? - Well... I can't remember. And drunk. Say, listen, Sarge, will you call Jeff Hunter head of the Record... ...and tell him one of your blind coppers just pinched us? A pull, huh? Joe, take him in there and let him sober up. Come on. Hey, Joe, we always sober up on club sandwiches. Listen, Joe, don't put any bacon in mine, please. Inside. Swell idea to get me out of bed in the middle of the night to get you out of jail. Next time, I'll leave you there till noon. - Oh, sir. - What? Do you think the world will give me another chance? I'll see you get a fresh start in life, little gal. - You will? - And you too, you big louse! No use, I'm a thief at heart. Well, come on, let's get in my car before we get a ticket. Okay, doctor. Tell me, though, where's the colonel? I thought he was with you. Say, he's down at the boat seeing me off, and the boat's gone. Well, we'd better take jailbird Bessie home. Oh, no, no, I think it's about time for me to get to work. I know, come on over to the shop and I'll make coffee. - Oh, Papa, she's got a shoppe. - Sure. Cheer up, my son, lots of girls have shoppes nowadays who are still good girls. Come on now, get in. Well, well, we're going to see the sun rise on the shoppe. Rollo, you might travel a million miles and never see such a sight. Oh, say. We'll have to have cream for the coffee. You haven't got a bottle of cream in your pocket, have you? No, no, clean out of cream. Nice to have neighbors who keep cows. Uh-huh, but don't ask me for butter, my churn's in the other suit. Oh, give me that. Come on. Well, not a bad spot. Aladdin and his lamps. - Charming! - I'll say it is. All right, if you wait right here, I'll have coffee in a jiffy. The sun is now rising on the shoppe. And you'll scoop the town with a story. Aren't you glad you're coming back to work on the Record? - All right, Jeff, I'll take the job. - Good boy. And now that's settled, would you mind telling me who she is? - Don't you know? - No. - It's Miss Valentine. Miss Valentine! - Yes? The man here from the Record wants to know your name. Mary Brown! Do you both take sugar? - Sure! - Two lumps, and that don't mean us. Miss Valentine's name is Mary Brown. You don't mean the Mary Brown down where the sun rises on the shoppe? - What did you say? - I said what this country needs... ...is a good five-cents cigar. Coffee ready in a minute. Corky, here's those strings on the murder case. Your daughter was hired yesterday afternoon, you say? What is the groom's name? Oh, his first name. George. I see. All right, that's fine. - Anything for me, Bertie? - Yeah. - How about a dog show? - Dog show? Well, all right. - Oh, hello, Rollo. - Hiya, Jeff. - Anything new? - Got this from the colonel. I don't know why I keep that guy on the payroll. I'm taking his wife to a show tonight just to square things. Want to come along? No, Bertie handed me the dog show and I got a short date first. Oh, that cute little Miss Valentine, huh? - Roses are red and violets are blue... - Oh, don't go whimsy on me. I'm just returning her Romeo and Juliet. Hello, Steve. Only stay a minute. Just time for a couple of laughs. - Nice night for them. - Hm-hmm. Oh, um... thanks. - Never read Romeo and Juliet before? - Sure, Elaine and I played it in highschool. I guess Shakespeare had somebody else in mind when he wrote it. - It might have been you and Elaine, hm? - Well, he didn't miss us far. Oh, I suppose everyone in love has something like that together. Yes, with Aubrey and me it was music. - What you were playing when I came in? - Uh-hmm. Gee, it got me. - Do you like it? - Hm-hmm. Reminded me of those nights down in Texas when Elaine... Say, I'm getting out of here before I cut my throat. I gotta cover the dog show. What, and leave me here alone to cut my throat? Oh, not a chance. I'm going with you. - All right, let's go to the dogs together. - To the dogs. Arf! Arf, arf, arf! - I used to have a dog like that one. - Like that one? Not bad. Look at the stance on that one. Note the bleary look and rundown heals, ex-newspaperman. - I can see what you're coming to. - Oh, is that so? Say, that one's got enough ribbons to make a pillow. - Look at his sad eyes. - Poor fellow. Oh, isn't that a fuzzy-wuzzy? Is he any relation to that big ribbon snatcher? Well, yes... then on the other hand in a way... ...he's relation and, that is, he would be if, um... All right, all right. Slightly illegitimate. - Oh, I want him. - How much? - Fifty dollars. - Fifty bucks? Well, I've got twenty. - Here, I've got about five just in case. - What do you mean, just in case? Well, that makes twenty-five. And this... Oh, dear, keep the watch. Pay you the balance tomorrow. Say, it's got a better pedigree than Fuzzy. - Look, look. ??? Say, he's a pip isn't he? What'll we call him, Fuzzy-Wuzzy? Yes... You mean to say he'll grow up to be as big these other dogs? Just as big and maybe bigger. You know, that pup might grow up to be a great man. Yes, sir, brought up right, in the right home with the right kind of schools... ...he might even be President of the United States some day. No, Papa, no, Mama. Why don't we get married and give him a couple of good parentes? - You're crazy? - Why not, what can we lose? - What are you talking about? - Sure. Getting married's no big leap for a couple of booby prizes like us. It might give us a chuckle or two. I mean it. Well... I hadn't thought of it like that. No obligations, of course, and if it doesn't turn out right, goodbye and good luck. I'll bet he's for it. For, as you both have consented in wedlock... ...and have acknowledged it before this company, I do by virtue of authority invested in me by the laws of the State of New York... ...now pronounce you husband and wife and may God bless your union. Well, well, well, just to think that little Miss Valentine... ...fresh from the refined influence of jail falling for this. Oh, don't spoil the child's honeymoon, leave that to me. - Come on, Mary, we'll get a cab. - Wait a minute, you're not going in a cab. - You're going in my car. - You can't go like this. - We've arranged entertainment for you. - Certainly. Friends await you. Sorry, boys, but it's not that kind of a wedding. You know what a crowd would expect from newlyweds. We ain't got that brisk look in our eye, pal. No, no, this is just like another football game, you know, substitutions. Mary for Elaine, and Steve for Aubrey. Well, if this were a game, you wouldn't be substitute, you'd be captain. Wait till the paint gets dry, you big wife-snatcher. - Come on, Mary. - Goodbye. Wait a minute, where are you going? See you when we get back from our trip around the world. - When? - Tonight. The Aquarium, Mac. Well, goodbye, goodbye, lots of luck. Yes... goodbye. Say, are they crazy, or am I? Well, you've been a little screwy ever since that trip to Cuba. This, Mrs. Porter, is the Aquarium. All my life in New York and I had to get married to see it. Now, Mrs. Porter, if you'll hold tight as we go round the curves, I'll show you the old white fish... from Australia! Australia? There we have the famous Garibaldi fish from Italy. All the way from Italy... Here you see the well-known squirrelfish from Hawaii. And straight ahead that wiggling little light-weight, the moray eel from the Mediterranean. The entire world in a 100-yard walk. From now on the aquarium gets all my honeymoon business, Mr. Porter. Ah, and look you, Mrs. Porter. An example of successful married life. Mr. and Mrs. Horseface celebrating their wedding anniversary. - Meet the Horsefaces. - This is indeed a great pleasure. Pardon me, Mrs. Porter. This is the girl I was telling you about. Yeah... yes, I finally married her. No romance there but the contentment of two tired cowards. Note the manner in which Mr. Horseface goes about... the business of providing soup and cauliflower... ...for the little woman and the little son. And see how happily Mrs. Horseface swims about her household duties. Do you derive any great moral lesson from this, Mrs. Porter? I certainly do, Mr. Porter. Every wife should know how to swim. Steve, dinner's almost ready. - So am I, doll, and I'm starved. - Good. - Mrs. Porter? - Yes. Thank you. Who was that? Oh, another wedding present, eh? Say, that's great, just what we need. Wonder if it's got an alarm. - Who sent it? - Aubrey. Oh... cupids, eh? - I get a good picture of that guy. - Cad. What's the matter, I just meant it gave me a good idea of Aubrey. - I bet he's cute. - Oh, you! Come on, Steve. I'm tired, I guess I'll go to bed. Oh, Steve! Well, after I've spent all afternoon getting dinner. Thought you said you were starved. Well, can't a guy lose his appetite if he wants to? Oh, wait, Steve. Your clean pajamas just came back from the laundry. I think you'd better buy a new pair of pajamas payday, Steve. What for? I'm not going anywhere. This isn't mine. It's mine. Hmm... Hearts and flowers. Cad. - I bet I can beat you. - I bet you can't. All right. Watch. There. - I still bet I can beat you. - All right. - You're stymied already. - Who's stymied? How about that? See? Tic-tac-toe. Beautiful darling, but not very smart. No, I suppose not. I suppose I'm just a cupid. No, hearts and flowers. Oh, is that so? Well, how do you like that? How dare you strike me, you big brute! - Who's a big brute? - You! How dare you strike me, young lady. You know, I'm the champion featherweight... You're what? That's not what I see now. Automobiles, creams, scotch, you'd steal anything. - A letter from Elaine. - Oh, pardon me. What part of the world is the little gal in, Rollo? - Back in London. - Oh, London. Yeah, London. Now I know why you wanted to cover the Derby. Oh, you don't get this, Jeff, you've never been in... I know, I've never been in love. But if I were in your lucky shoes... Well, I'd never let the sun set on that shoppe. I can't help it, Jeff. Elaine... means to much. One word from her and your insides spell Thursday, I know. All right, dream on, Rollo. Oh, Jeff. - Hello, wake you up? - No. - Steve come home? - Uh-uh. Not last night either? Maybe he's having a good time. I don't worry about him, Jeff. You know, we agreed when we were married not to worry about each other. Well, would a little worry from me to you be a violation of the moral code? I don't need it, Jeff, really I don't. Funny girl, won't even take a worry off from a gentleman. I'll round Rollo up and send him home. You know how it is with Steve and me, Jeff. If either of us strays, it's... Well, it's just a case of finder return to owner and no questions asked. Oh, sure, sure. Imagine you for an owner. Well, goodbye. Goodbye, Jeff. More on the head, Charlie, he's a little bit weak there. - What happened? - You cleaned out Joe's place last night. - No kidding. - It couldn't have been anybody else. When I got there you were on the floor alone, slightly unconscious. You know, Jeff, I've been thinking. As an employee I am a little uncertain. Terribly uncertain, Rollo. I fired you last night. Oh... Afraid to have me go to London, huh? Foggy place, London. You've got a nice home here, though. Just the same as you left it three days ago. Why don't you try going back home? I am going. Incidentally, I know an advertising agency that wants a... Don't you worry about me. I'll find a way to get to London. - Hello, Steve. - Hello, darling. Hello, Fuzzy. Well, I... I guess you're wondering where your wandering boy has been. No. Just figured you were in the usual places. You look tired, Mary. You look a little tired yourself. I am, but I've got a reason. Well, not a good one, but a reason. You know, Mary... I'm just a lot of trouble for you. I figured it all out coming home and... now that Fuzzy has grown up and able to take care of himself... There's more than Fuzzy to think about, Steve. There'll be four of us before long. Rotten of me to tell you now, Steve. I hate blurbs. I hate a woman who holds a baby over a man. I intended to wait until you came back from London. If you came back. And then tell you, "By the way, Mr. Porter, we had a baby last week." You know, sort of an afterthought. I must be tired. London's off anyway. I lost my job. Well, that's funny. I've always been told those things happened together. Sure. Everybody gets hit that way some time or other. Why, the Horsefaces had the same thing happen to them... ...right before their first baby was born. - You're crazy. - Sure, no fooling. Old man Horseface was a lifeguard down at Coney. And the day the little woman broke the news, he got fired. I didn't know he drank. - Oh, sure, he drinks like a fish. - No! Yes, sir, and that night he angled home pretty mad. And when he's mad, he has to have lemon. And there wasn't a lemon in the house. So out he goes for lemons. And right at the southeast corner of Washington Square ...he stumbles into a millionaire pie baker looking for an apple-skinner. And that's how Mr. Horseface got on his feet again. That's why the first Horseface baby wouldn't wear button shoes. And let me tell you, Mrs. Porter, what a Horseface can do a Porter can do! - You're bound to win, my boy. - You betcha! Gee, I'm sorry I'm late, Mary. I tried to get here as fast as I could, but the traffic was awful. Oh, don't you worry, Steve. We got along all right. Well, can you beat that? Say, they look kind of Horsefacy at first, don't they? Oh... we'll get over that, won't we? Hello there, son. I'll make a halfback out of you, all right. Say, you look a little like Jim Thorpe. Oh, I'm sorry, Steve. I guess you've drawn another blank. It's a girl. Hello, girl. Things never turn out right for you, do they? Oh, I'd have been a flop at a father and son banquet anyway. Mrs. Porter should be resting now. Will it be all right if I come back tonight? Certainly. I'll bring some flowers tonight. So long, sister. I can take her back now. Hello, pudding. My goodness gracious, aren't you ready yet? Fuzzy... why don't you put my baby's hat on? He's a bad dog, isn't he, sweetie? What do you think, Your Honor? At last we're going to see the Horsefaces. Yes, ma'am. This is Daddy's and Mama's wedding anniversary. Only Daddy's forgotten what day it is. I guess he's got a lot on his mind, hm? I'll tell you what. If the Horsefaces ask you where Daddy got his grouch, don't you let on. You just tell them he ate a pickle, will you, huh? - Taxi's here, ma'am. - All right, Kate, tell Mr. Porter. Come on, sweet. Mrs. Porter and the baby's nearly ready, sir. Shall I tell the taxi to wait? - All right. - Yes, sir. - Have you seen him any place? - No, madam, I don't see him no place. Perhaps he ain't come. What's wrong, Mr. Porter? - Don't you remember what day this is? - Sure, it's Wednesday. Who was it? Where? I don't care if you spoil my day, Steve. But don't spoil hers. Oh, I'm sorry. Hello there, darling. Oh, gee, you're looking cuter every day. I don't know what Daddy'd do without you. What's the matter, Mr. Porter? If it's Elaine, why don't you go to London and see her? Elaine's in New York, she got in today. - Oh, so that's it. - Well, why do you say "So that's it"? I thought we had an understanding about all that. Of course we have, Steve. I don't want to see the Horsefaces today, do you? Take us back to the house, will you, buddy? - Come on, love. - There you go, sweetheart. Aren't you coming in? Oh, I'll be back in a little while. Oh... Oh, I see. All right. Oh no, you don't see. When I'm going to see Elaine, I'll let you know. I'm just going to the barber shop. There's a man in the house waiting for you. - For me? - Yessum, it's you he want, honey. - All right, Kate. - Come on, honey. Oh, you had a nice ride, hm? Did the girly have a nice ride? Forgive me, Mary, but I had to. Aubrey! Oh, it's so good to see you again. Like coming back from a bad dream and finding everything all right. You don't know what a nightmare I've been through. - It didn't work out. - It was hopeless from the start. Nearly drove me crazy. Honestly, Mary, I wanted to kill myself. Aubrey! Oh, just let me look at you. You don't know how I've missed, Mary, how I've needed you.. Why didn't you let me know? I started to a million times. I even came to see you. But I never had nerve enough to come in. And I'd hoped you were so happy. But that's all over now. - She and I have called it quits. - Divorce? Some day. But now, peace. I want to get away. I'm going to Vienna. An orchestra there. My boat sails tonight. Oh... Mary, I tried to go without telling you. But I can't go without you. You've got to go. Oh, no... - No, I couldn't do that. - Why not? One life that's all we're given, Mary. From here to here, and then the end. It's up to us. I've made a mess of mine and of yours. And now another chance. I need you, Mary, terribly. Does that make any difference? It means a lot. Every woman likes to think that a man can't get along without her. And I can't, Mary, I won't even try. And you love me, don't you? I've never gotten over it, Aubrey. I wouldn't be here if I didn't know how you're married. There's someone in his life too. She'll come back, and then what? Will you stay? Steve might not care if I went... just now. Together again. In a studio in Vienna just like the old one. Lost from the world. - My baby, Aubrey. - Well, bring the baby. Oh, no... I couldn't take her. Steve might not miss me... He might even be glad. But he'd miss the baby. - No, I couldn't do that to him. - But she'll be all right. It'll be just a couple of months, weeks, before I get straightened out... ...and then we can come back and settle all that. Oh, the baby won't suffer, Mary, you know that. Or even know the difference. Why, that's old-fashioned. - I'm trying to think. - Don't think, Mary, or try to reason. It won't come out right all around, it never does. You've got to pick your way. A little happiness as you go. And it's our chance, Mary. Oh, it's right, it's... it's intelligent. It's the way things were meant to be. And it will never come again, Mary. It's now or never. Mary... Wait, Aubrey. Kate. I want you to pack my bag for me. You mean for going away? Yes, will you hurry, please? Yessum. Your Honor, I'm putting this case up to you. I want to go away with someone who loves me very much. Someone who wants me more than anyone will ever want me again. And if I go, what difference would it make to you? None. You won't suffer. A baby doesn't need it's mother half as much as a mother likes to think. And after all, Your Honor, a baby's only an episode in a woman's life. An episode that grows up and goes on... ...and forgets. Twenty years from now if I told you I'd given up happiness for you, you'd call it pretty old-fashioned. Or you'd think I was blaming you. And I might be. You'd say, why didn't you go? Now, wouldn't you? I'm going. No, I'm not going to cry. That would be the usual thing. And I'm not doing the usual thing. I'm doing what millions of women have wanted to do, but haven't had the courage. Here's your bag, honey. All right, Kate. - You know what to do, don't you? - Yessum. - And I can trust you to do it. - Yes, ma'am. Better give her a little milk of magnesia before supper. Yes, ma'am. Goodbye, Your Honor. Take this to the car, Aubrey, I'll be right out. Hurry, dear. We've got to stop at the studio first for my luggage. Hello, Plaza Hotel? Mrs. Leonard Brannen, please. Yes. Hello, Elaine? What a difference your being here makes, Mary. This place is paradise again. Remember, Mary? Bayside 93294. Yes, please. The baby's all right, just as she was when you left. Oh, darling, you mustn't do this. There's nothing to worry about. I don't know that. I'm not sure. - I'm going home. - Mary! I can't help it, Aubrey. I've got to. I'm different. Marriage has done something to me. Everything has changed. You, this. - That. - But it'll all come back... ...if you'll only give it a chance. Mary, I can't let you go, I won't. - I need you too much. - Oh, but... my baby needs me too. Or I need my baby. I don't know which. She must need me. I couldn't stand it if she didn't. And Steve... Oh, it's no use, Aubrey. It's part of me now. I'm sorry. You know what this will do to me. Nothing. If you love me, you won't let it do anything to you. You'll realize that we've both been pretty selfish. If we had our moment, we ought to be grateful for that. Stop crying for the moon. Goodbye, dear, write to me. How can two people be head over heals in love and not know it? - The baby! Where is she, Kate? - Upstairs. - Is she all right? - Sure, sure. Are you all right, honey? You didn't hear what Mama said, did you? She didn't mean it, darling, no, no... She was just talking, just raving. You, an episode. Why, you're everything, you're the world. Oh, I love you. I need you. And I want blurbs, lots of blurbs. Oh, I love them, love them. Don't you cry. Mother'll never leave you again. Never. Oh, Kate. It's all right, honey, now, don't cry. You don't need to cry. Did you give her the milk of magnesia, Kate? No, I thought I'd wait till you'd come home, honey. - You'd better give it to her now. - Yes, ma'am. I told you there wasn't no sense in crying, honey. You darlings. You don't know how glad I am to see you. The only statement I'll make, gentlemen, is that I'm very happy. I little, um... anniversary remembrance from the workmen of the world. Love's number 4.369. They're lovely! And incidentally, we're throwing a little party here tonight, a celebration. Tell the lady it's a surprise party... on you and Steve. Forty or fifty people. Well, it was to have been a surprise party, but due to a slight oversight on the part of my young son, we forgot to order any food. I resent that, sir, the oversight was joint. A joint oversight on the part... of the parties of the party of the first part and the parties of the part... Well, anyway, of the parties. We want a boy in the kitchen and a few mixing bowls. Kate, come on. The dam is broken. Did you bake a big cake? Oh, yes, just about a mouthful for the colonel. Here's the cake, Mrs. Porter. Oh, there's Steve. Ah, a word of greeting to Rollo. - Why, hello, Rollo. - Hello, Jeff. Hope you didn't have any trouble finding the house. Oh, in case you forgot the flowers, it's your wedding anniversary. - Say, I did forget. - The wife's name is Mary. Come right in. - Mrs. Porter, meet Mr. Porter. - Hello, Mr. Porter. - Glad to see you. - Surprise. Oh, a little anniversary gift from the lady maccabees. Thanks, Steve, you remembered. A Porter never forgets. Oh, barber shop. All dolled up for the party tonight, hm? - Party, what party? - Anniversary party. Just a couple of hundred people, a quiet little affair. - Oh... - Look how glad he is. Well... You see, the trouble is... Elaine got in today and... I told her I'd see her tonight. Well, that's all right, Steve. You go ahead. - The party isn't important. - All right, I'll go ahead and... You don't mind if I come along, do you, Rollo, I've always wanted to meet Elaine. Me, too. We'll both go. Oh, don't worry, I'll restrain my charms for your sake. If we like her, we'll bring her here. Well, I know, but... Mary wouldn't want that, would you, Mary? Why, sure, Steve, why not? All right, I'll go and bring her out... Don't you bother, Rollo, we'll get her. - Where's she stopping? - The Plaza. Oh... better press your pants. Gee, Mary, you're acting swell about Elaine. Well, that's what we agreed, wasn't it? Shrug of the well-known shoulders, goodbye, good luck. We've had a lot of laughs together, Mary. But you don't laugh at love. It's funny, isn't it, how there's just one person in the world... ...who can turn you inside out and hang you up. Yep... funny. Guess I'd better go up and dress. Well, here we are. Hello, there, Elaine. - Mary! - Uh-huh. Oh, I'm going to like you. I'm sure you will. - I, um... - Steve? He's just trimming his beard. Oh... don't tell me he has a beard. Oh, no, no, no, of course not. I was just joking. Want to powder your nose? Yes, thank you. We'll be down in a minute, boys. You'll receive the guests, will you? Must be getting kind of late. Yes, it is getting late. - You mailed those invitations, of course. - Why, certainly I mailed the inv... Would you mind flapping that rear fringe into place, I simply can't make it stay down. Love to. Steve always called those curls his little jump-ups. - Silly, wasn't it? - Wasn't it? And maybe Steve would prefer them jumped up. Oh, no, no, not right at first. You're awfully nice, Mary. Will you take pity on me and powder my back? I can't afford to let Steve discover a single flaw. Big responsibility for me. He has such a dazzling picture of me in his mind. - Impossible to cope. - Of course. You know, I don't feel so guilty now about coming here. Because you and I seem to understand each other pretty well. We're a lot alike, I think. Tell me the truth, Mary. Isn't Steve beginning to wear just a little? Well, to tell you the truth, in another month I'll have to give him a coat of paint or trade him in. I knew it. You know, if wives could forget their vanity, they'd welcome the other woman. Of course, in your case it's easy because you and Steve have never been in love. Is that belt straight, Mary? Perfectly straight. Will you come down when you're ready? Of course. I do like you. You've no idea how much that means to me. She's beautiful, Steve. - Do you really like her, Mary? - She's lovely. - Well, maybe you can understand now... - Don't blame you a bit, Steve. Hello there, Romeo. Hello, there, Juliet. Seems like a million years, doesn't it. And yet, like only yesterday. Gee, I had a lot of swell things to say to you, but... I can't think of them. Did you want to tell me I'm still beautiful? You're more beautiful than ever. Angel. I have some lame excuses for not meeting the boat... Don't, Stevie, I know. Mary. You didn't want to hurt her. I like that in you. But it was a useless fight, dear. Nothing could keep us apart. And now that we're together again, nothing will ever separate us. Mary understands. Now I want to look at your darling little house. Oh, it isn't much. Is this the garden? Oh, I... I'm just going to show Elaine the roses. Finder return to owner? I'll, um... I'll go up and have a look at the baby. I threw your daddy away today. Hm-hmm. Just picked him up and threw him away. I've learned to love blurbs today, but... I didn't want to be caught at them so soon. You learned to love Steve today too, didn't you? I always did love him. I found it out today. Got my stardust this afternoon, Jeff. Came drifting down like snow. But when I reached out for it, it was... confetti. A lot of confetti around this year. Picked up a little myself. You too? Steve's a swell guy, you know that, don't you? He's perfect for you and you for him. But if he wasn't... I mean, I mean, if you weren't... No, I mean, if I wasn't... Well, I haven't anything to say, I'm tongue-tied. Do you like cherry pie? Oh... sweet Jeff. Them words mean a lot to an old man. Well, goodbye. Look at me, Steve. Kiss me. Wouldn't it be funny if we ended up just good friends? You aren't fooling me, Steve. You're just posing. I know that you want me more than anything in the world. You always have, you always will. Oh, darling, look at this glorious night. Made for us. See that lovely spot there beneath the trees? Where the moonbeams dance on the lawn. Hm-hmm. Had the woodpile there last year. And next year, Mary wants to build a little playhouse... ...under that tree over there for the baby. Oh. You didn't see the baby, did you? - No. - Oh, it's funny how they get you. Particularly girl babies. Girls have it all over boys. In your subtle way you're telling me you don't want me. Oh, don't put it that way. You're telling me you're in love with that... Please, don't! I thought it might be a little chilly out here. - Thank you. - Do you mind if I get my coat? Neuritis. I'll see you before you go. Have you read any good books lately? Good gosh, Mrs. Porter, but am I glad to see you. - You are? - Oh, tickled to death! You don't know what I've just been through. - Didn't it work out? - No. Take a look at the biggest fool on earth, will you? Oh, Mary, I've been blind, blind as a bat. It's too late to matter and... ...I don't suppose it'll give you heartburn. But I'm crazy about you. You wouldn't deceive a small girl, would you, Mr. Porter? Listen, Mary, when your turn comes, I'll try to be as good a sport as you've been. But don't expect too much. Because I'll never let anybody take you away from me. Well, don't worry about it. I had my turn today. I couldn't make it, Steve. Got to thinking about a little Horseface and a big Horseface. And it got me, pal. Don't tell me it's love that's picked us up, Miss Valentine. Well, if it isn't love, there's a pin sticking me. Well, I... Say, listen. Can you find time to go on your honeymoon tomorrow, Mrs. Porter? Honeymoon? Oh... Let's do something new. I've been on one of those darn things for three years... ...and didn't know it. Come here, Mr. Porter. - Subtitles - Lu?s Filipe Bernardes
