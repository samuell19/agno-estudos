Get up there, boy. Turn around, let 'em see you. My name is George Masterson, and those of you that know me know that I carry only the very finest of product. Alright, everybody. Gather round here. We got slaves for sale today. They take no more care than your cattle. The two young ones here, they're good prime breeding stock. I've broken these niggers, they won't give you any trouble. But if they do, you bring 'em back. The woman, she can cook, she can sew. $200 for the whole family. $50 for the little boy. He'll make a fine kitchen slave. Or you can work him in the field. Ivory Coast slaves, the best there is. They're broken under the whip. You can work 'em to the bone... What? In your house, sir. They holed up in your own house. Is this from him? Mmm... Curse you, Masterson. Curse your house and all that is Masterson. Take this, Elizabeth. It will protect you. God, I'm beat. Used to be enough to cut an album. Now you've gotta be an actress too. You've only got one more day. I tell you, if I wasn't in the middle of that video, I'd move in right now. Well, your friends in la aren't gonna believe this. You moving in with a doctor? - It's pretty boring. - Ah, friends, good riddance. Besides, you're not just a doctor. You're my doctor. Yeah, right. But what about when the album and the video comes out, and all the fans hear that Kate Christopher's back? You'll be traveling all over the world and you'll forget about the old doc here. Maybe. It seems bigger at night. You think so? Well, look, I figure we put the piano right there in the corner. - What do you think? - Honey, right here. Really. Okay. Where's that wine? Don't move. I'm gonna get some glasses. Oh! Hey, you'll never guess who asked Jason for my autograph today. Who? His teacher! Can you imagine that? A teacher asking a seven-year-old kid for his mother's autograph? I think it's pretty unprofessional. So, how does he like school? I don't know. He doesn't say much about it. Strong silent type like me, I guess. Huh? He needs a father, I think. Well, you want me to fill out an application? Oh, David. - I don't wanna screw it up again. - You're not gonna screw it up. Now, come on. I don't even want to hear you saying that. All that stuff's behind you. You sure you don't want me to take Jenny home? No, that's alright. She just lives up the street. - I'll see you, kid. - Alright. - Hi. - Hi. I took some ice cream. Oh, that's alright. Have as much as you want. Has he been asleep long? - Um, about an hour. - Was he a good boy? - Yeah, he was real good. - Good. Okay, let me get my purse. How much do I owe you? Honey? Jason? You're all sweaty, honey. You must've had a bad dream. Oh. Take it out of the refrigerator. - Right. And then you put it on... - Morning, Claire. Oh, morning, doctor. - Kate called. - Thanks. - Uh, try Dr. panidge for me, will you? - Sure. - Morning, Ben. - Oh, hello, David. - How's the new place? - Oh, it's great. I'll see you at the staff meeting. 'Dr. brightman, please pick up 2-4. Morning. Doctor, I can't sleep. Those dreams, they still keep me up. Alright, you go back inside now, Betty, and I'll see you in a few minutes, okay? - General. - Hello, Charlie. I've mobilized the troops, sir. Morning, Sherry. Anything come in? Yes, Michael Murphy came in a couple of hours ago. State sent him down. He stabbed someone he thought was threatening him. Alright, I'll see him first. Anything else? Yes, Anne woodbury came in last night. Good. I was expecting her. - Any special instructions? - Well, how does she seem? Well, she's very active. She's refused breakfast. And, uh, she hasn't stopped singing in the last eight hours. Give her 15ml of librium every four hours. - Prn for sleep? - Oh, dalmane. 50ml if she needs it. Alright? I'll see Murphy now. Hey, hey, you the doctor, man? I'm Dr. young. This is my associate Dr. Kim. He ain't no doctor! He ain't my doctor! You tell them to take their hands off me! You can't keep me here! Get 15mg haldol ready to give him po. Alright, let him go. You heard me, let him go. And take those wrist straps off. Do it we're not gonna do anything except try and help you, Michael. Michael... all we wanna do is take good care of you. We just wanna check you over and have a look at that bruise on your head. But first I want you to take some medication for me, alright? - I ain't taking nothing. - Michael! Give me the medication, Kim. I want you to take this, Michael. All it'll do is help you calm down. It'll make things go a whole lot easier for you. Go on, take it. J love will live and love will die j in a beat of the heart j a beat of the heart j a beat of the heart j in a beat of the heart, a beat of the heart j a beat of the heart j in a beat of the heart, a beat of the heart j a beat of the heart j cut! - That was a great take, Kate. - Really? Wanna print that? Brutus, Bob. Let's get him on a dvp for next week, see how he progresses. Saunders, miles. Let's hold his medication setting, and maintain a 24-hours suicide watch. - Are you gonna be good today? - Yeah. - You gonna be nice to your teacher? - No. Quick. I made you something good. Bye. Bye. Bye, guy. David, how's Kate doing? Oh, fine. She's working again. - Still on medication? - Not that much. She's got dalmane to help her sleep if she needs it. You're serious about moving in with her? Yeah, Ben. She's moving in tomorrow. Ben, she hasn't been my patient in almost a year now. She's been through a lot. It takes a long time to get over something like that. She's as healthy as either one of us. She's doing great. She's working again, she's a good mother. Well, I just wanna make sure you know what you're doing. What do you think of Claire's new hairdo? Oh, the hairdo is marvelous, but that girl could really use a... See you next time. Thank you. Alright. Okay, mate. - Kate, it was a great job. - Oh, Harlan, don't. Really, I mean it. It was super. I loved it. - It's good to be back. - Well, it's good to have you back. So, are you going out on tour, then? I don't know if I've got the time. It's gonna... Oh, Harlan, I'm sorry. I gotta pick up Jason. - Oh... - I'll give you a call. Yes, please do. Alright, see you later. Bye, then. Well, what do you think? It's terrific, huh? Hey, wait till you see the back yard. Come on! Come on! See? Have fun, sweetheart. I'll be inside. - Oh, hey, I'm sorry. Are you okay? - Yeah. I'm Wally, the painter. - Hi. - I didn't know you lived here. Say, listen, I'm through up in the bedrooms now and I'm doing the study. - Can I take that for you? - Oh, yeah. These go in the bedroom. You know you got some pigeons up there in your attic? Attic? I didn't know we had one. Well, I don't know how you get up there, but that's where they're at. Yep, that's where they're at, alright. Right here's where I heard 'em. This wall has been papered over, but there was an opening here once. You can see these cracks here between the boards. You might want to have that opened up sometime, take care of those pigeons. 'Dr. young, pick up on 32. - Dr. young. - Hi 'hi. Where are you?" I'm at the place, but I'm calling from down the street. - They haven't put the phone in yet? - 'No. They said not till Monday.' "the painter was here. Did you know that we've got pigeons in the attic?' pigeons? Where? - In the attic. - 'Sweetheart, there is no attic. Well, yeah, there is. You get in through Jason's closet. 'Jason's closet?" 'Dr. young, please report to room h.' - 'room h.' - Look, sweetheart, I gotta go. I'll talk to you about it tonight, okay? I love you. Well, we're moving out, kiddo. - Mom? - Yeah? Are you and David going to get married? I don't know, honey? Do you think we should? Hey, you like David, don't you? Yeah. Well, then I guess we're just gonna have to play it by ear, huh? Right, let's get cracking on these boxes or we'll never get out of here. Mom... Yeah? Can we bring cochise with us? Of course. Of course we'll take cochise. J with a turn of the head, in the blink of an eye j under cover of night... & cut! I'm sorry, Harlan. Can we try it one more time? It's alright, Kate. - Alright, everybody, start rolling. - Okay, back to one. J with a turn of the head, in the blink of an eye j under cover of night... & j "the love we had didn't quite turn out j 'like we thought it might - j 'for years and years... - Cut. Alright, everybody take five. What's the matter, love? What is it? I don't know. It's my throat. Well, let's have a look. Hello! We're here. - Oh, good morning. - Hi oh, look, guys, uh, just put those down in there anywhere. Hey, Jason. How's it going? Well, you wanna see your new room? Well, I'm gonna go check on the piano. Come on, buddy. Come on. Well, this is it. It's all yours. Hey, how about a game of star raiders? Jason, come here. Look, these are called diskettes, and on them are the programs that run this computer. - Surprise! - Hey, that's not fair! So that's where our pigeons are, huh? - Yeah, you want a tour? - No, thanks. I'll pass. - You wouldn't believe what I found. - What? - You wanna see‚Äù? - Yeah. What? What is it? "George Masterson." - Ever heard of him? - No, I don't think so. And I was sure we had a famous composer living here. And look at this. It sure looks weird, doesn't it? Well, whatever it is or was, it looks like it was broken. Hey, Jason, how did the picture turn out? - It didn't. - It worked fine yesterday. Look, let me see it anyway. I threw it away. Well, then we're just gonna have to take another one. Where did you say you wanted that piano, ma'am? - Mom? - Mmm-hmm? Will you please close the closet door? Sure, sweetie. - Where did you get this key? - I found it in the yard. Hmm - Mom, do they live there? - Who? The pigeons. Well, they do now, but they're gonna have to find another place to live. Do we have to kill them? No, sweetie. They're just gonna have to go back out the way they came. - Good night. - Good night. Wow, what a gorgeous dress. Hey, listen to this. "September 22nd, 1857. "I've taken the child to stay with my mother "and left George to his music. "I miss him already." That's sweet do you suppose this belonged to her? Could be. "George says that I am a constant source of inspiration, "and when I leave, his music suffers greatly. "He says he's writing a special piece dedicated to me." How romantic. That must be the music for em. "George has be..." What? Nothing. - Would you like some tea? - Yeah, sure. It'd be nice. "The slaves I hid have put a curse on George. 'He's changing. I am afraid.' "They gave me a strange stone. 'I know not what it means, but they said it would protect me.' David that was very nice. I didn't hear you come down. You were sleepwalking. Kate, we were talking about the Masterson thing just before you went to bed. It's only natural that you had a dream with those associations. But David, my song? Alright, I admit that it sounds like "beat of the heart". But so what? You just shot a music video that was set in the 1800s. Katie, it's a major unconscious preoccupation for you. It doesn't surprise me. I think it's very strange. David, where's that diary? Katie, please. You already have an overactive imagination. Just forget it. Wow! Jason and I were gonna explore the neighborhood. Wanna come along? Ah, I'd love to, but I got a ton of work to catch up with. Okay. The toys went by themselves, huh? That's a neat trick. - Really, mom. - I believe you. I wonder if they have any ice cream in the store. - Yeah. - Well, if there is, we're gonna find it. What? What the hell? Boy, when we want ice cream, we get ice cream! Alright. Easy does it. No, no, no. You're off. Lean to the left. A little more to the left no, no. To the right now. Now, wait. Hold it right there. Excuse me, detective. Ah, doctor. You know, you really should get yourself an outdoor antenna. Let me see now... You've been here for five days, right? That's right. We moved in last Tuesday. And you found the bones for the first time this morning? No, I found them several days ago, but I thought I'd use them in my nightclub act. Look, doctor, it's Sunday and I'd rather be home, watching a football game and eating my wife's cooking. Now, I don't know where these bones came from and you don't know, but I'm sure we both know that they came from somewhere. - David, what's that trunk? - Kate what...? What happened? Well, David found something and the police had to come and get it. - What did he find? - He found some bones. Some old bones that belonged to people that lived a long time ago. Good night, honey. Are the pigeons gone now? Yeah, they're gone. So, how did he take it? I think it scared me more than him. Katie, are you serious? Well, first the dream, now this. There you go with that damn dream again. What were they doing in that trunk? Packing for a trip. How the hell do I know? I gotta get up early tomorrow. I'm gonna take a shower. Just tell me what you saw. I saw Masterson. - What do you mean you saw him? - In the bathroom before. Oh, I see. So, we're going back to square one again? Well, you were the one that told me I was ready. Do you remember that, doctor? Or was it just you couldn't wait to get your hands on the patient? Oh, that's a bunch of garbage. All I said was that it's only been a year and it's not uncommon for these symptoms to manifest themselves. There you go again. Will you stop treating me like a patient? Well, stop acting like one. - What's the matter, sweetheart? - There's a bad smell in my room. Oh, baby. Come on. It does smell kind of funny in here. You want salami or peanut butter? Salami. No, peanut butter. No, salami. Make up your mind, buster. Right... - So, you're rehearsing today? - Yeah. Hey, whatever happened to that Wally guy? Is he gonna finish this damn roof? He left his tools. He must be coming back. Yeah, I guess so. Well, I'll see you tonight. 'Dr. Keller, please report to icu." Hey! Hey, what are you doing? I'm watching that. What are you doing? Let me get... wait... oh! I'm... I'm just trying to get... - I'm... - Detective whitcomb. - Detective, how are you? - Just fine. - I'm sorry about that. - That's alright. Why don't we go talk in my office? This way. Call it professional curiosity or whatever you want. I'd just like to know a bit more about George Masterson. You know, what sort of man he was, what kind of things he did. I don't know why you're calling on me. I'm only a cop, doctor. What you need is a historian. Besides, I've already closed the case. What about those bones? "Dem bones, dem bones, dem dry bones! "Now hear ye the word of the lord!" Do you have any idea whose they were? I sure do. A woman and child. Lab says they got to be at least 140 or 150 years old. That's too old for us to handle, so case closed. Detective, I'd like you to take a look at this. It belonged to Elizabeth Masterson. Look, doc, there's nothing that I can do with this. Maybe she can make something out of it. Why are you so interested anyway? Well, I guess out of professional curiosity. Hello? Hello? Is somebody there? No, daddy, no, no! No! Nol no! No! No! Don't! Don't! Mom! David Well, hello, Kate. Kate? Kate! Honey, where's that diary? Oh, I gave it to the police. Why? I... kind of wanted to read it. Well, the cop wanted it. - What did he say? - He said thank you. - I mean, anything about the bones? - Damnit I don't understand your fixation with those bones. And not just the bones, your dreams. No, excuse me, your visions. I am trying, Kate. I am really trying. But this is bullshit. It's all bullshit, Katie. Is it me? Come on, tell me. Is it? Huh? Come on! Is it me? It must be. Because there's no other reason. Alright, alright. You see ghosts? That's great. Well, I see 'em too. There's ghosts in this house, Katie. Where are they, huh? Huh? There's one now. Come on. There's more. Where are they? Where are the ghosts, Kate? There's one now! - Look, there's another one! - David, stop it. David, where's the diary? Quit asking me about the goddamn diary! - I wanted to read it. - I threw the fucking thing away. Alright, great. What am I supposed to do? - Go fish it out of the garbage. - Oh, fine, fine. David? David! Aah! Katie, what's the matter? What is it? Here, this will help you sleep. Look, I believe that something's got you very upset, and... I believe that you did see something, I'm just not sure what you saw was real. Look, Katie, don't you see it doesn't make any sense? Suppose you did see me turn into this... this thing, how come I don't know about it? Why don't we just go to bed? We can talk about this tomorrow. Jason, you're not eating your cereal. I'm not hungry. - I got meatloaf for lunch, alright? - I hate meatloaf. - Well, what do you want? - I don't know. I'm looking for detective whitcomb. That's one flight up, second door on your left. Thank you. Ah, miss Christopher. Come on in. - Have a seat. - Thank you. Uh... - Now, what can I do for you? - I'd like the diary that David gave you. Is that all? Well, that's easy enough. It's pretty old. You'd probably get a few bucks from a collector for it. Well, how's the house? - Making much progress? - It's fine. Miss Christopher, are you okay? Thank you, detective. Oh, by the way, tell Dr. young that I spoke to my friend over at the historical society, and I got that information that he wanted about this guy Masterson. Seems he wasn't a very nice fella. Those old bones from your attic turned out to be his wife and kid. 'God help us. He's not human. 'And each day grows worse. 'He almost killed the child tonight were it not for the stone. "Thank god for the stone.' Oh, my god. Oh, my god! Oh, my god. David! - What? What's wrong? - Jennifer's in the fountain. Baby, relax. It's just a tree branch that fell, that's all. No, David, in the fountain! What? Take me someplace else. I don't like this place. We can go away this weekend. I mean for good, David. Let's just move out. Baby, I can't just pick up and leave. We got a lot tied up in this house. - You know that. - Mom! Mom! I was playing skyfox. Katie? Katie, what is it? - Sweetheart, what's wrong? - No! No! Jason! Jason, sweetheart. Come on, we're leaving. Let's go, now. - Be reasonable. You're just upset. - No, David, I'm not. - Katie, you're not leaving. - Oh, no. No. Come on, let's go. Oh, David, please don't. - No, stop, stop! - Jason, stop it. - Stop it, Jason! - No, stop! She's okay, Jason. She's okay. She'll just rest until tomorrow and when she wakes up, she'll feel better. Stop looking at me like that. I know what I'm doing. I didn't hurt her. No! Nol help! Help! Nol Oh. Morning. I made you some breakfast. So, how are you feeling? I think you should sleep for a while. I don't think you're ready to get up yet. Jason... - Hey, why am I in my clothes? - Don't worry about Jason. I already fixed his lunch and the school bus picked him up. Now, you just rest. I gotta go out for about an hour or so, okay? I'll be back. Oh, god. 250mg of amytal? I didn't mean to give her so much, Ben, but the boy was pulling on my arm. David, you should never have taken it upon yourself to administer medication to her. Why didn't you call me? Why didn't you call my service? There wasn't time, Ben. - Where is she now? - I left her sleeping. She'll... she'll be out at least an hour or two. Well, I think we ought to bring her in for observation. Yeah, I guess that's the thing to do. I'll get a bed for her. "The stone broke today and I am afraid of what may come.' - "Whitcomb." - Oh, thank god. This is Kate Christopher. Well, how are you, miss Christopher? You've got to come quickly, please. My son is in danger. The stone broke, which is why Elizabeth died, and her child. Whoa, honey. Slow down. You don't believe me. I know you don't believe me. Yes, Christopher, female. C-h-r-i-s-t-o-p-h-e-r. That's right, immediately. Ben, you know, I think I might wait on this. What? I think maybe we're rushing into this too fast. I'm not sure it's necessary. I think I'll go home first, see how she's doing, take it from there. David... look, can you hold on for just a second? I said, can you hold on, please? Thanks. 'I'm sorry, miss Christopher, Jason's not in class. 'He didn't come to school today.' general? Hey, doc, they're letting me go in a couple of days. I wanna thank you... 'Dr. Thomas, please pick up line six.' will you give me...? What the. .? Holy shit! Damn it, where's that other half? Jason? Jason? Nol Jason! Oh, thank god. Listen to me. \we have to leave. We're... gonna go to a hotel, just for a few days. Don't worry, David's not here. Come on. We gotta hurry. Mom, we forgot cochise. Jason, no! Jason! Jason, let's go. Now! Hi, guys. You guys look like you're going somewhere. Let us go, David. Don't you think we ought to talk about it? Kate, what in the world are you doing with that knife? Don't come any closer, David. Just let us go. Come on, don't be ridiculous. Put that down. Please, David. I don't wanna have to use this, but I swear I will! Now, get out of the way. Whatever you want, Kate. Come on, come here. Oh! Come on! Oh, my god. On! God! On! Oh, god! Hello, miss Christopher. I'm fine now. Wanna see? Brutus, what are you doing? You know you're not supposed to do that. Oh, hello, Kate. Sorry about that. We've been expecting you. I've arranged a bed. Where did you say you wanted the piano, ma'am? Miss Christopher, those pigeons are in the attic. Yeah, that's where they're at, alright. Great, Kate. Great. Super. I loved it. Great. That was really the best one all day. Mom! Mom! Jason! Mom! Miss Christopher. Next time you take me home. Oh, god. Jason? Jason, where are you? Mom! - Jason? - Mom, we forgot cochise. Hello. I'm sorry I couldn't get here sooner, miss Christopher. I had a little car trouble. Whoa, whoa. George would like to see you. He knows where your son is. Giddy up! Hello, Elizabeth. I knew you'd be back. Where's my son? He's fine, my darling. Elizabeth please let us forget our differences. You shouldn't have done that, Elizabeth. Jason! Bring the stone! No! Oh, god. Put them together! Nol Bye, mom.
