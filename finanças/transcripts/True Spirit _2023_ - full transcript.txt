I grew up on the Sunshine Coast in Australia, which means my family and I were never far from the ocean. If we weren't in it, we were on it. We practically lived on our boat, Home Abroad. It was a tight fit, Mum, Dad, and the four of us kids, but we were happy because we were together. At night, Mum would tell us stories about a starman in the sky, then the waves would rock us to sleep. I'll never forget the first time I sailed by myself, the rush of excitement when my sail caught the wind, the magic and the allure of the sea. I was the captain and the whole world was in front of me, just waiting to be discovered. I could hear the ocean calling my name. By the time I was 12, I was obsessed. For four years, I studied the ocean, the waves, and learnt everything I could about sailing boats. I worked three part-time jobs and saved money, because I dreamed that one day I would sail around the world. ♪ Walking on a dream ♪ ♪ How can I explain? ♪ ♪ Talking to myself ♪ ♪ Will I see again? ♪ ♪ We are always running For the thrill of it, thrill of it ♪ ♪ Always pushing up the hill Searching for the thrill of it ♪ ♪ On and on and on We are calling out, out again ♪ ♪ Never looking down I'm just in awe of what's in front of me ♪ ♪ Is it real now? ♪ ♪ Two people become one ♪ ♪ I can feel it ♪ Jess, how's the practice run going? Cargo ship hit me. Came out of nowhere. You taking on water? No. No, doesn't look like it, but I've been dismasted. Why didn't the alarm go off? Okay, give me your coordinates. Uh, we're at 26 degrees, 25... Jess, breathe. Focus. Oh, my God, what happened? She's okay. Collided with a cargo ship. She was hit by a cargo ship? Cool. Not cool, Tom. Is she gonna be all right? - I'm sure she'll be fine. Go back to bed. - As if. Jess, are you hurt? No, Mum, I'm fine. Really, I promise. Thought we agreed, no collisions. I couldn't help myself. Can I talk to Jess? I want to talk to Jess! - Oh, can I talk to her? - I haven't talked to her. - Jess, was it a pirate ship? - She's getting her coordinates wrong. Okay, come on. That's it. - I'm calling the Coast Guard. - Don't. Reporters will be lining the docks. They are waiting for her to fail. She cannot come limping back in. - Do we know if the boat's seaworthy? - She reckons it is. - Oh, well, as long as the 16-year-old... - Jess needs to know she can do this alone. She's only 20 miles from the shore. Now imagine if she does this, and she's 2,000 miles from the nearest port. We'll be at the marina to meet you. It's probably not that bad in daylight. Thanks, Em. Jess! Okay, so when I say tack, we're gonna switch the sail to the other side. You ready to win? All right, guys, let's get started! Hey! Jess, what's wrong? - I'm not ready. - No? - Oh, sweetheart. - Don't want to go, kiddo? I think we're still finding our sea legs. - Fair enough. - Well, I heard you're the favorite to win. Yeah. Maybe. Come on, Jess! You won't know what's out there unless you try. No, no, not too far. Wait, Emily, wait! Quick, Jess! Whoa! Come here. There you go. Jessica Watson's only sea trial has been cut short, proving her critics... Atherton! Hey, Atherton! How come he's allowed down there? - Atherton. - Ben. Don't know what you lot think you're doing here. Well, I guess we're here because... that boat is a shockingly tiny thing to send a child out to sea in. - It's pretty flimsy too. - Leave it. Vultures. Then don't feed them. Why aren't we feeding vultures? It's not every day that someone as young as your sister tries to do what she's doing. It's a big deal. People have questions, that's all. - Mm. - Plus, it makes her a target. If she succeeds, she's a hero. If she fails, well, tragedy sells. She's ten. They're looking for weakness. Don't let 'em treat you any different. You're a captain, got it? All right, I'm Ben Bryant, Jessica's advisor. Jess. I... I'm Jessica Watson. And, uh, I... I'm planning on being the youngest person to sail around the world nonstop and unassisted. Jessica, what happened last night? - There was a collision. - Were you at fault? A cargo ship detoured from its route. Jessica, this was night one of your only test run. How are you gonna make it around the world if you can't make it between two ports? Uh, and we're not here for you. Thanks, Ben. I believe I can. You understand what you're in for? Uh, we're talking open ocean, waves the size of apartment buildings, 70-knot winds. I mean, this is the Mount Everest of sailing. Well, yes, the... the route is challenging, but, uh, I've sailed half my life, so I... So a couple years then? I've done the 10,000 nautical miles. I'm qualified. And we've prepared. How could she prepare for a cargo ship that ignores its radar? So why didn't your proximity alarms alert you before the crash? I forgot to turn them on. Mr. and Mrs. Watson, surely you have reservations hearing that? She made a mistake. It's one I'm certain she won't make again. So you don't think 16 is too young? Who are we to deny her her dreams? She's worked hard and proven she can do this every step of the way. So when is the new departure day? Uh, well, I guess we just have to leave by mid-October. So two weeks. Hmm, optimistic, no? Well, it's the last window before the Southern Ocean's filled with icebergs. Jessica! Well, what about calls by authorities to cancel altogether? Ben, are you the right person to bring this girl home? Got a bit of experience. But as captain in the Millennium Cup, you lost one of your own crew members. A Matt Turner. Hey! That's enough. - Well, let me finish... - Nah. We're done here. Four years of hard work boils down to this. Ben, I looked at the radar and I didn't see the ship. And it was just a short nap. So I didn't think that... No, you didn't think. It was irresponsible, Jess. You know you kept getting your coordinates wrong too? It's your state of mind that matters out there. If dyslexia takes over, you are lost in the middle of the ocean, mate. All right. All right, we get it. Do you reckon we can fix it? Bit of a dog's breakfast, but... Yeah, there's some life left in her yet. I mean, these aren't small repairs, though. We've got no money, no manpower, no location to even fix it. Yeah, but won't my sponsors help? Not sure they'll want to pay for a new mast twice over. We can get creative with a lot of it. You know, reuse this rig, patch where possible. Not a chance. We do it right, down to the smallest bolt. But what if we can't get the money? - Then you wait another year. - Dad! Your safety is the only thing that matters. And I have no problem calling this off if things aren't done properly. You know... maybe we should regardless. This has been quite the wake-up call. - No. It was an accident... - Hey, no one's making any decisions now. Let's wait and see what the sponsors have to say first. Right, Jess? Yeah. Yeah, right. Oh! Ugh. Last year's NRL Grand Final winners, the Manly Sea Eagles, look set to take out the premiership again this year after thrashing the Melbourne Storm 34-6 over the weekend. This will be Manly's third consecutive Grand Final. Don't forget netball after school. - Eyes on me. And... - Yep. And, go! Oi, very good! Don't think anything new's gonna appear in there, Tom. Very good. - You're gonna make yourself dizzy. - I know! - Got you! - Oi! Cut it out! - Would they pay me for interviews? - Not enough for repairs. - Jessica Watson's adventure... - Jess, look! ...began when her family packed up their lives and traveled across Australia. When she read solo sailor Jesse Martin's book, she was inspired to circumnavigate the globe. While homeschooled, 12-year-old Jessica began training with infamous sailor Ben Bryant, and worked rigorously to pursue her dream. But has that dream turned into a nightmare? Whoa! Plot twist! Child welfare groups are calling the attempt by the schoolgirl irresponsible and dangerous. They can't help themselves. A child does not have the ability to understand the risks involved. You'd think they'd have something bloody better to talk about. The question on everyone's lips, "Is Jessica Watson too young, and where are her parents in all of this?" You do have to wonder if this is Jessica's dream or theirs. It's on social media too. They're calling us "bogan pirates." Oh, come on, that's great. Let me write a comment! - No, Hannah. - No, Hanna, no. The Queensland government is working on a bill to stop Jessica from sailing, citing child welfare. They can't do that! Can they? The person you are calling is unavailable. Please try again. It can't be that bad. Oh, no. No, just everything's falling apart. Sheds are booked up. Can't afford help or parts, and now, none of my sponsors are responding. You have to give them a minute. I don't have time. I bet they're watching the news. - Everyone's saying I can't do it. - Who cares? - You think you can. - Only if I get Pink fixed in time. I know things aren't going according to plan, and... I know how frustrating that is. But it's when things go wrong that your true character's revealed. And right now, I'm looking at a strong, committed, tenacious young woman who will figure this out. So I'm not those things the rest of the time? No, the rest of the time you're an absolute nightmare. Yeah. You can overcome anything if you keep working at it, Jess. I've watched you do it before. It's impossible. Let's try something a little more up your alley. The colors will help you focus. Try again. Hmm. "Jesse Martin, the youngest person to s... sail solo ar... around the world." Around the whole world? You can do that? I did a full inspection and I got costs. And we'll need a new mast, new rigging, hull repairs. That is just a slight delay, I reckon. As long as I'm on the ocean before November. - Hello, Earth to Ben! - What? Come on, Ben, I'm serious. We can still do this. - There's still time to fix up Pink... - I know. You coming? Where to? Got something to show you. - Ben, I don't want another boat. - Yep. Pink and I are a team. I know Pink. I know when she's angry. - I know when she's in trouble. - Yeah. Rounded up a bit of assistance. Once the media attacked you, I couldn't stop 'em from volunteering to help. Why? Well, media went after one of our own. You might be sailing solo, but you belong to a tribe now. This gets you on the water before they pass this blasted bill. - It's all real, Jess. Look behind you. - She's here! Hey.

No. Maybe the journo's right, maybe I should just... quit, and sneak out to parties. Dad definitely doesn't like that either. Trust me. You know, people are always gonna have opinions on what you should and shouldn't be doing. But I see how happy you are when you sail, so just do it for you. You're very wise. All right. Surprise time. - Okay. - Mm-hmm. I set up a blog for your trip. - What? - Don't worry. I'll run it. Then everyone can hear your voice, 'cause I think it's worth listening to. Sometimes. Thanks, Em. Tim Tam? Okay, I'm warmed up. - You guys good? Three, two, one. - Rolling. And the day has finally come. In just a few hours and after several setbacks, Jessica Watson is set to embark on her solo voyage, ignoring her critics and outrunning the government bill. Whoo! That's the one. Print that. There you go. Yeah, thanks, darling. For when you get lonely. No, I can't take Kobi Koala. She's your favorite. Yeah. That's why she's just on loan. Okay? All right, then I promise to bring her home safe, yeah? - All right, fast and quick. - Yeah. Mmm. Doing an awful lot to get out of homework. Bye, Tom. All right. So I packed the chocolate you asked for. - Don't eat it all in one go, all right? - Thanks, Dad. I want you to call and give me your longs and lats twice a day. Why? Because if you get them wrong, I'll know you're stressed. Using dyslexia to spy on me? Yeah, that's right. No buts, all right? You'll be all right. Hey.

It's a good luck charm from my first nav. Always brought me back. It's yours now. - Ben, I can't. - 'Course you can. Oh. Go on. Get out of here. Bye, Jess! Good luck! Bye! She'll be okay. Mmm.

Don't touch anything. - Then don't touch my Weet-Bix. - Fine. Fine. All right. Is that Jessica? - I got it! I got it. - Mine, mine, mine! Hey, mate. 27 degrees, 33 minutes south, and 170 degrees, 30 minutes east. Spot on. How are the supplies, do you have enough? Dad, I only just left. - Okay. - Uh... Oh, no, Jules! Oh, my... Jess! Hi, Mum! How's it feel out there? Worth the wait. Chuck the rope. Ugh. I got it. Just do it! Is that acceptable? Yep. Thanks, kid. No one thinks I'm big or strong enough to do anything. But I am! I practice all the time, whenever I get the chance. You don't have to prove anything to me, mate. Well, that's what girls have to do. Are you Ben Bryant? - No. - Yes, you are. You lost the tip of your pinky finger sailing in Antarctica. I didn't lose it. - I put it in the drawer. - Cool. You've done 12 Sydney to Hobarts and circumnavigated solo three times. Is solo sailing good? Yeah, it's great. No one talks to you. I'm trying to get experience so I can sail the world, but no one's giving me a chance to. So? Make your own chance. Hi, I'm Jess. Welcome to my video log! Traditionally, sailors keep log books, but you can't deprive me of screen time for half a year. I'm sure it'll just be my mum watching, though. Hi, Mum! I thought I'd give you a tour of my home for the next seven months, so... Here's my kitchen where I'll be cooking. And here is the nav table where I control all the electrics and communication. Uh, my berth, where I'll sleep. Oh. Dunny. Uh, and this is where all my food is. For example... Oh, my God, freeze-dried broccoli. Nice one, Dad. So I'll be sailing unassisted and nonstop. So if I pull into port, I'm disqualified. And I have to cross all lines of longitude and round all four capes for it to count as a true circumnavigation. Here's what I'll be doing. Okay, here's Sydney. Going northeast, up past the equator, then back down south to round Cape Horn at the tip of Chile, then across the Atlantic Ocean to the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa, then over the Indian Ocean to Cape Leeuwin in Western Australia, then down around the South East Cape in Tasmania, and back up to Sydney Harbor. So not so much really. Come on! All right, so this is the tiller to steer, but it's on autopilot at the moment. Uh, the lifeboat is under here, and in here is the drogue. It's like a soft anchor. It slows the boat down during storms and keeps it stable. Here's my shower, although I have discovered that I left my hairbrush at home. So I'll just have to use this for 200 days. At least the backyard makes up for it, though. Hungry, Kobi? Oh. - Jess. - Hey. Uh, ship detection alarms work. Uh, one just went past northwest of me. Good to know. Well, that'll be the last ship you see for a while now. How do you know? Listen, let that crash be a lesson to you, eh? You know how to handle it now. - Did you ever get lonely? - Oh, sometimes. - But I know how to get over it. - How? - Sing. - Sing? You... You sang? We're sailors. That's what we're supposed to do. Try to get some sleep, eh? You've just got the first-week jitters, that's all. Oh! Fish are calling. - Gotta go. - Okay. Come on. Oh, bugger! ...the local girl who is now attracting national attention. Jessica Watson's family traveled Australia in a purpose-built double-decker bus before moving onto a boat when Jessica was nine. Now, seven years later, Jessica is about to cross the first major milestone in her attempt to be the youngest person... There we go. ...to sail solo around the world. Thanks, Susie. The real danger, of course, will be the Indian and Southern Oceans, where dozens of sailors, who are far more experienced than young Jessica Watson, have endured knockdown after knockdown. Didn't need to hear that. - Solo sailors looking... - Ah, well. ...to circumnavigate the globe endure many months... Okay, so crossing the equator is a big deal for sailors. You've proven your seaworthiness and must be initiated into the Fraternity of Mariners. Okay, so... South, twenty, fifteen, ten, five, zero! We crossed from the Southern Hemisphere into the Northern Hemisphere! Okay, for the initiation ceremony... Quite refreshing, actually. A toast to King Neptune! - To Jess. - To Jess! Cheers! I can't believe she's crossed the equator. So cool. Red sky at night, sailor's delight. Red sky in the morning, sailor's warning. See the forecast? Yeah, sky says it all. Yeah. Jess, this is gonna be a big one. Let's talk game, eh? I'll change course. I think you should launch the drogue. Weather it. Go through the storm? Well, it's moving fast. There's no way you're gonna outrun it. But that also means it's gonna pass quickly. - Thank God. - W... Hang on, hang on. We agreed to do whatever's safest. Storms in this region aren't common, Dad. It's hard to judge. It's like an anchor. The drogue will keep her stable. She'll be okay. I think it's our best option, Jess. It's your call. Okay. Talk to me. Protocols. Yeah, let's break it down. I don't know. I don't... I don't like this. Ben knows his stuff, whatever you think of him. What's more, so does Jess. - You know the drill. - Yeah. Come on, drogue! Whoa! I have something to tell you. I want to circumnavigate the world solo. And I'm gonna be the youngest person to do it. Uh, Jess... What? Jesse Martin did it when he was 17. He was an ordinary kid, so am I. Mmm. Mmm? Don't worry, I've got a plan. I'll get a teacher, qualifications. Here's a list of all the things I'll need and the safety courses I'll do to start. I'll get jobs to earn money, and find sponsors to cover the big costs, and for every hour I sail, I'll still do an hour of reading. Now, that's a good amount of reading! - She knows her audience. - Yeah. Well, uh, you'd better start working through that list, then. Thoroughly. I think you can do anything you set your mind to, honey. Oh. Jess! You okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. - What happened? Why didn't you call? Well, I got knocked out, but I'm fine. - What? - Knocked out? Are you okay? - Do you have a concussion? - Sick. - You need a doctor! - Oh, I didn't pack one of those. Hey, come on. Jess, listen to me. Do you have a headache, ringing in the ears, or nausea or something? Dad, please stop. I'm fine. Is Ben there? How's Pink? Yeah, she's all right. You weren't strapped in, were you? - I was getting there. - Well, you should've already been there. Mother Nature doesn't wait for anyone. You know that, Jess. It was a storm. It doesn't matter. You have to manage it. You're just lucky you got through this one. It was so wild, Ben. I thought we were gonna go all the way around. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, it's Ben. Let's go. Ben! We just had word Jess went through her first storm. Any injuries or damage? We aren't taking any questions, but Jess has a blog at this address. Diversion 101. It's not that hard, Ben. Is there anything you can add? Ben, excuse me. Excuse me! Just one sec. She's going through... - Wait! Wait, Ben, sorry. - Jimmy, hold this. An albatross, one of the only living things you see in the middle of the ocean. They've been watched by sailors throughout history. I think I caught a fish! Okay. Ooh! Okay. Come over here! Can you see it? Oh! Hello. My turn! All right! Tom, grub's up! - Yup. - Here you go. - Eat up! - Thank you. Morning! Ah. Ben? Here you go. I don't eat breakfast. Uh, well, don't then, but it's here if you want it. Want to write something? Jess, I got into Sydney Uni! Oh, my gosh! Em, that's fantastic! Congratulations, you did it! I should warn you, Hannah's already gunning for my bed. Right. Oh, you'll be gone before I get back. Yeah, I'll still run the blog, though. Jess, I won four medals at the swimming carnival! Wow, Han! That's amazing! I wish I could have been there. And guess what? Tom has a date. - Why would you... - What? With who? Give me the... Okay. - Jess! - I want the phone! I don't, I don't! - I don't know what... - Yes, he does! - I'm telling her! - He does! He does! I'm talking to her and I'm telling her who it is! I don't have... I don't have a date. - He does! - I don't have a date. Snap. - Go on, what do you got? - Boogie board! What? A boogie board? You'll be shocked to hear that Hannah's riled up on sugar. Well, she's not the only one. And it's not even Christmas here yet. - Oh, is Em around? - Yeah, hold on! Em. Hey, Jess. Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! A Grow Your Own Friend! Aw, thank you, Em, it's just what I need. Yeah, I hear she's a great listener. - Hey, my turn! - Oh, here's Dad. Merry Christmas, love. Hey, I hear you've got a new mate. What have you two got planned for tomorrow then? Oh, well, I'm hosting, uh, but my guests are a little quieter than yours. That's pretty cool, Hannah. That sounds great! Mind if I come to yours? Jess! I forgot. Find the leeks bag. Do you hear that? Leeks bag. ♪ Rockin' around the Christmas tree... ♪ Ben! Mmm. Merry Christmas! Yeah. Come on in. Merry Christmas, Ben! - Merry Christmas, Ben! - Yeah. Merry Christmas, mate. - There you are. - Oh, thanks. Oh, I love them. Thank you, Tom. All right, it's a bit loud. I'm gonna go now. Everybody say goodbye to Jess! - We love you! - Yeah, see you, Jess! Tom, music! Yup. - Take this. - Yeah. Cheers. Yeah, you're like... All right, food's on the table! Come on, you lot. Hope you're hungry! Right, cracker time, Han, come on. Big pull! - Sorry, Ben. - Ben. Hmm. Ben, what do you usually do for Christmas? Nothing. What about your family? Oh. Uh, don't have one. Oh. - Merry Christmas. - For me? Open it, open it! Thank you. Ben, why is Cape Horn such a big deal? Oh! Well... That is some wicked sailing. See, that's where the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans meet, so you get these powerful winds, these churning currents, these humongous waves as the oceans smash together. That's why that passage is so sinister. It's absolutely littered with a long-lost trail of fingertips. - Uh, Ben? - Hmm? Uh, could you maybe be a little less excited about our daughter doing something sinister? All right. We talking fast sailing? Wicked fast. Oh, my. Oh! Whoa. Look how fast she's going. Bloody hell. Oh, not... not too fast. It's... She's going quick. - Whoa. - Come on! We just rounded the Everest of the ocean, Cape Horn, and I am happy to report it was smooth sailing. And so cool! I, uh... I just... I just can't believe it. It's like we've passed our biggest challenge. Do you hear that? It's the sound of nothing. Nothing at all. There's no wind or waves. It's been days. You know where I am. I'm gonna sail around the world and I'm hiring you as my coach. Tell your parents there's plenty of coaches at the sailing school. I know, but I want you to do it. Well... I don't sail anymore. Because of the Millennium Cup, I know. But if you help the youngest person in history sail solo around the world, people will let go of what happened with Matt Turner. They might, but I won't. Hey, why... why do you want to do this, anyway? 'Cause... no one explores anymore. You know, there have been more people in space than have sailed around the world. I didn't even know it was something you can do, but you can, and I want to. 'Cause I'm an adventurer. You like sailing. Circumnavigating the globe is a whole different thing, mate. Well, that's what I want to find out for myself. You're gonna do this no matter what I say, aren't you? If I was going to agree to this, I'm not gonna treat you special, 'cause it doesn't matter out there. I'll only treat you how I treat myself. Oi! First rule... don't do that. It freaks me out. - That's it. Come on. - Okay. - Ben, you've barely slept in days, mate. - Eh? - Take a break. - Oh, nah. No, no. I'm good. Just, um, waiting on these logs. What is Jess doing? Jess? You've been going backwards for hours, mate. Yeah, I was asleep. So you didn't set the alarms? Well, barely moved in a week, how would I know we're going backwards? Again, that's why you set the alarms, mate! Yeah, okay, chill out. "Chill out"? Hey, this is dangerous, okay? This is when things go wrong, when people get hurt, when people neglect their responsibilities! And you, if you keep on like this, you're gonna get yourself killed! Yeah? Well, you'd know! Oi! What's going on? I, uh... You're right, Jess. Yeah. I need to chill out. Jess? There's no wind, and there's no waves, and now there's no Ben. And it's just me. And I... I can't get away from myself. I still haven't moved. Oh, thank God you picked up! What's going on, Jess? Mum. What is it? It's okay. I'm here. Get it out. I'm so alone. No, you're not. I know how awful it is to feel like this. But... it won't last forever. I can't tell you when the wind will pick up, but... I know that if you keep going, it will. Just as it has done for every sailor before you. Do you remember the song I used to sing to you at night? Yeah. I want you to search for the brightest star in the sky. And every time you look at it, know that I'm here, at home... staring at that same star. I'm with you. Okay? Yeah, okay. I love you, Jess. I love you too. ♪ There's a starman waiting in the sky ♪ ♪ He'd like to come and meet us ♪ ♪ But he thinks he'd blow our minds ♪ ♪ There's a starman Waiting in the sky ♪ Hi.

Ah, but through it all, I've tried to be this... this tough, stoic explorer. And... ...that's not me, you know? I'm not always fine, or strong, or fearless. Phew! "Fearless." I'm often terrified! And I doubt myself. And... I think a lot about giving up. But that's okay. It's okay. 'Cause there's... there's strength in being yourself. You know, I think... that's as hard as climbing any mountain. You know, I think there's bravery in admitting that you're not okay. Oh, God, it's scary. It's as scary as... almost being swept overboard in the middle of a storm. Not that I'd know, Mum and Dad. So... I'm Jessica Watson. Yeah, I'm tough and I'm struggling. And living my dream is... is... is hard, but it's so worth it. Even the bad days. Because the world... Yeah, it can be a difficult place, but it's... ...it's also really, really beautiful. ♪ Didn't know what time it was ♪ ♪ The lights were low ♪ ♪ I leaned back on my radio ♪ ♪ Some cat was layin' down Some rock 'n' roll ♪ ♪ "Lotta soul," he said ♪ ♪ There's a starman waiting in the sky ♪ ♪ He'd like to come and meet us ♪ ♪ But he thinks he'd blow our minds ♪ ♪ There's a starman waiting in the sky ♪ ♪ He's told us not to blow it ♪ ♪ 'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile ♪ ♪ He told me ♪ ♪ Let the children lose it ♪ ♪ Let the children use it ♪ ♪ Let all the children boogie ♪ Pink, you found the wind! ♪ Ooh, feel like I'm on it ♪ ♪ Ooh, feel like I'm on it, yeah ♪ ♪ Many times we said, oh yeah We said we could reach the sky ♪ ♪ Southern cross will light the way So then we can find the Milky Way ♪ ♪ What did you say about the Milky Way? ♪ ♪ Ooh, ah, ah, yeah ♪ ♪ If we leave now to reach the moon We'll get there soon ♪ ♪ Positive mind ♪ ♪ And if they try to explain We can just hold tight ♪ ♪ Dancing to our own tune ♪ ♪ Reconnected through the power of love ♪ ♪ Nothing can stop us When we swim to the moon ♪ ♪ Ooh, ooh, ah, ah ♪ ♪ Gimme, gimme, ah, ah ♪ ♪ Oh, oh-oh ♪ G'day! ♪ Many times we said, oh yeah We said we could reach the sky ♪ ♪ Southern cross will light the way So then we can find the Milky Way ♪ ♪ What did you say about Milky... ♪ Do you mind?

Hi, Dad. Um, any word from Ben? He's tracking you from his boat. He's okay. He just needs a minute, love. If this weren't nonstop, we would be pulling into port for repairs, no question. I mean, leaking on a boat is not what you want. But as long as we've got a clear shot and an easy run back home, it should hold. Pink's designed to correct herself if we roll over, as long as there are no leaks. That's what Ben would say too, I reckon. A lot of rips out there today. Know what you're doing? - Go with 'em. - Don't fight it. The ocean'll always be stronger than you and every other being. If you wanna sail, better learn to get along with Mother Nature. She doesn't mean you any harm, she's just doing her thing and sometimes we get in the way. Come on then. Let's get in there. Jessica, this is the Prime Minister of Australia. - You can call me K-Rudd if you... - Gimme this. Hey, Tom. What's up? To be fair, the prime minister has been talking about you. Em, you're home! Just for the week. It's crazy, everyone at uni knows who you are. - Oh, God. I don't know if I want that. - Well, then brace yourself. That picture of you rounding the cape is in newspapers all over the world. Everyone's cheering for you. So please start doing your hair. Oh, come on. I have a fork for a brush. How's uni? Any new boys in Sydney? Maybe! Oh, my God, who? Well... Hey, uh, could you get Mum on the phone? Now? Bad weather on the way. Really bad. Storms. "Storms," plural? They're even coming right at me from Antarctica. Five times the size of the last storm. I think you might have to pull into port. Quit? No. No, I can't. Not now. I'm not sure you're gonna have an option here. Let me check the sky. Hey. Why... Why are you doing this to me? Why couldn't you just give me a break? The front's already generating gale force winds of 70 knots, with a 40-foot swell. So will Jessica pull into port but get disqualified in the process, or keep going? Thanks, Craig. What about cutting through Bass Straight? It's an option, and could shield her from the worst of the weather. Though she'd miss the fourth cape. But she'll live, Susie. That's what we're talking about here, isn't it? Her survival. Australian teen sailor Jessica Watson has been confronted by another challenge in her attempt to become the youngest person to circumnavigate the world. You have nothing to be ashamed of. Even the most experienced sailors would pull in too. Yeah, even Ben would. Jules. Yeah, but I'm gonna let everyone down. You're not letting anyone down. - Have you even seen your comments? - What comments? On your blog. Told you how to do this. No, you didn't. Yes, I did. Okay, open your laptop. Click the link on to any post. Scroll down and watch. I can't wait to check how you're doing every morning. You're stronger than anyone I know. There are 14 children on the council estate who borrow my computer to follow your video diary. Oh, you are such an inspiration to these kids. I am going to climb the Seven Summits. Thank you for making me see it doesn't have to just be a dream. I'm 12 years old and I'm also dyslexic. Following your videos has made me think that I can also reach my dream and one day become a pilot. Thanks for making us part of your journey, Captain Watson. I'm gonna call you back. We are so close. So, so... One, two, three. We love you, Jessica! See you in Sydney! There has to be a way. I just want to get her home. Okay, so I've done the numbers over and over, and there is another option. I could outrun the western storm. - No, not gonna happen. - Ben, you're back? Yeah. About that, Jess, I shouldn't have lost it. I let fear take over, and I'm sorry. No. No, no, no, I'm sorry. Look, I... What I meant was that I'm not him and this isn't the Millennium Cup, and you're not gonna lose me, Ben. You're stuck with me. Uh, storm incoming, remember? Yeah. So the worst of the storms are gonna hit in 72 hours, so what if I go through them? What? These are not the kind of storms you weather. No, I don't want to weather them, I want to move with them by not using the drogue. Jess, you have to. The drogue's what keeps the boat stable. Yeah, but in the Pacific storms, it slowed us down like an anchor. Yeah, that's the point! Yeah, but then we were battered by these waves 'cause Pink fought them. I mean, you said we shouldn't fight Mother Nature. So let's work with her. Let Pink surf. Wait, she's right. If you stand in front of the wave, it knocks you down, but if you surf with them, it doesn't. Most of the time. Yeah, look, without the drogue, you're gonna be up against 60-foot waves, Jess. Yeah, so instead of getting battered by 'em, we'd ride over them. Pink being small would actually help. Is Pink up to this? You only just patched that crack in the bulkhead. Will it hold? You're also exhausted, Jessy, and the storm sounds like a marathon. I'm so close. Hey, don't worry about that. Making it home alive is more important right now. You're gonna have to pull in. I agree with Ben. Be safe. No! Cut through the straight. Yeah, I like that option. I like the surfer one. I'm guessing you vote for "pull in," Dad? Well... yeah, it's obviously the safest... Oh, Jessy, uh... I... I don't know. I really don't. I... I barely sail offshore, but you, God, you've sailed around the world. Look, you know the ocean, you know your boat. I trust that you know what's best. Your Dad's right. You're the captain of that ship. We will support whatever decision you make. Thanks, Dad. Thanks, Mum. I love you. We love you, Jessy. Ben, my gut is telling me to go through these storms, and I'm not gonna use the drogue. It won't be easy. You'll need to be calm, endure fatigue. It's gonna last days. I know. I can do it. I've got this, Ben. As long as you understand the consequences. I do. You're the captain, Captain. - Pizza for Watson! - Pizzas! - Pizzas coming through. - Grab 'em! Pizzas. - Oh. - Pizza! Tom, can we get some more information, please? Tom, just a quick second. Everyone right to go? Okay, brief statement. Jess will be tackling the storm, continuing on in her attempt to become the youngest to sail... nonstop and unassisted around the world. Surely, she should pull in. The captain has made her decision. No further questions, thank you. Hannah! Emily, can we get a quick statement, please? Emily? Australians have seen particularly terrifying storms ravaging the coastlines. The timing of the storm front is especially devastating for Jessica Watson, whose nonstop, solo, and unassisted circumnavigation is one cape shy of being completed. Hold on, crew. We got this, Pink! Hey, Ben. Isobars are getting close together. What does that mean? The storm cells have merged. The three fronts have morphed into one giant storm. Now, one can only imagine how Jessica must be feeling right now as she's about to face her toughest challenge. ♪ There's a starman waiting in the sky ♪ ♪ He'd like to come and meet us ♪ ♪ But he thinks... ♪ ♪ There's a starman... ♪ Jess, we're all here. Hey. Hey! Could you talk to me? I need distracting. I love earthworms! Nick! Nick, the boy's name's Nick. Um, what boy? What boy? And what if I don't make it? Not an option, mate. Hey, tell you what, Jess. You get back in one piece, I'll take Bowie out of the docks and sail to Sydney to meet you. Deal? You'll sail? Like, open waters? Yeah, yeah, I might even sail home to New Zealand. But you gotta get here first. Yeah, okay. Deal. Jessy? Jessy, you still there? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Might've had a point not wanting me to do this, Dad. I'm scared! Oh. Oh, Hannah, me too. But I chose to be here, yeah? I chose to be here and I'm never gonna regret it. Nothing ventured, nothing gained, right? - That's impossible. - What? What's impossible? What's impossible? - What? Tell me, quick! - Jess! That's it, Pink. You're doing great. Please, stop! Please, let her go! Jess? Mum? Her emergency alarm went off. She's... 15 feet underwater. No. No, she's all right. Call her. Hey, the phone... The phone loses signal in storms, remember? It's just the phone. It's just the phone. C-C-Come on, Jess, answer. Okay. - Jess! - Stop. - Jess, no! - Stop, Tom. No! I got you. It's all right. - No. - Jules. No... - Okay. - No... Jess? We made it. Pink saved me. Jess? Hi, Mum. You don't know how good it is to hear your voice. Oh, God. Yours too. Oh, God, you should see the sky right now. Yeah? Pretty special? Really special. Jess, can you come home already? You're aging me! Yeah. I think I'm ready. She did it. She bloody did it! Come here! Come here! Jess... You see? You had us worried, Jessy. - Are we rolling? - It's Hannah. Everyone ready? You got the shot? Jess has made it through the storm. She suffered no serious injuries or damage and is on her way home. - Yes! - All right. All right. All right, all right, everyone, off the lawn!

You've done our nation proud. You now stand tall as Australia's newest hero. It's so great to be home. But I'm actually gonna disagree with what the prime minister just said, I don't... I don't consider myself a hero. I'm just an ordinary girl who believed in her dream. You don't have to be anyone special to achieve something like this, you just have to find your dream, believe in it, and work really hard.
