"Slowly, covertly, a girl came in that house." - What's this? "Though she knows everything." "But she doesn't say anything." "But she will someday." Come on. - It's okay. Bindu! - Yes. Go to sleep. It is getting late. - Okay, sister-in-law! "She never utters a word, but I can understand her feelings.." Jani.. How can you smile? Since 2 years you're crazy about her. You are roaming behind her like mad. Did she respond even once? Did she even say thanks to you? Curtain closed. She did that because she is concerned about me. - What? Yes. If she had left the curtain open till morning, I'd stand here. That she knows. Breeze, mist and cold. If I fall ill, she won't be able to bear it. That's why she closed the window though she didn't want to. Hi. How are you? - Fine. Cheers! How are you? Hi, Sudeep! - Hi! Happy 10th anniversary of your concern. Thanks! Please!

If you don't sign, the cheque won't get passed. Excuse me! By the way, then as a donor I'm asking this. How was my last month's fund used? For your Rs. 15 do you expect a bank balance sheet?

The maid would do. You go and sit. What happened, Bindu? You used to give thousand excuses to escape from work. Now you don't remain idle even for a minute. I'm talking to you... What happened? - I'm trying to forget somehow. What? Who? Jani. - Jani? When he was alive I ignored him. Made him chase me. Now he is at a place where I can't reach him. They say it is easier to forget by crying. But when I cry I remember him all the more. That is why I'm not crying. Sir! - Sit, sit. Please! Sit down. Are you missing Nani? How do you know? - Come on, Bindu. We are friends. I still remember my wife's death. When she was in death bed she held my hand and made me promise. "You must forget me once I'm dead." She said only when I forget her she'll get happiness. If you really loved Jani, you must forget him. Bindu! Bindu! Relax. Relax now. Come on! Sir! What happened? Nothing. Nothing. Nothing.

Why did you come here, sir? Open it. - Sir! Open it. Open it fast. Can't you hear? - You said not to disturbed. Sir! What are you doing? - No, sir! No, sir! Don't beat me, sir. - Don't move. In Ganapati chemical scam MD was fully exposed. As far as I know he'll be stripped. What is there to hide? It is naked truth. Suddenly you told me to come. I met Education Minister in Delhi last week. If you meet him and explain the details, we'll get national recognition. National level. Tomorrow I'm going to Delhi. If one of you comes with me, I'll introduce to him. So who is gonna come? - I'll come, sir. Presentation isn't as easy as eating a pizza. Bindu! You go. - Me? Last time collector sir also said your presentation was good. Yes, correct. - What are you thinking so much? You go. Sir! Bindu will be coming. - Yes, sir! Bindu is coming. Yes.

I'll be there in 10 minutes. What the? Shit man! Hello! - Bindu! There is traffic jam here. Oh no! - Nothing to worry. Do one thing. You take the boarding pass. I'll be there on time. I'll come. Okay? - Okay, sir! Go back! Stop! What is he doing? Move back! Did you have to stop here? What are you looking at? Wipe it clean. - Yes, sir! - Hello, sir! Sir, you're here? - My car got stuck in traffic. I need a car. You take my car, sir. Give the key to him. Hello! - Bindu, I'll just reach in 10 minutes, so.. It is okay, sir. Flight is delayed. You can make it. - I'm coming. "Fly! Fly! Fly! Search me with your eyes." "Fly! Fly! Fly! "Come out. Come out. Come out." "Fly! Fly! Fly! Fly!" Fly! Fly! Fly! Fly!" I will kill you. I will kill you.

Nurse. I'll give sedation to sleep. Give him Diazepam 2ml. Take care. Bye! Sir! Do animals take revenge? Didn't you hear what I asked you? Do animals take revenge? They do take. In Barjatiya films. Not in cinema. In real life. It happens in real life too, sir. My grandma said! It seems a King Cobra took revenge on my grandpa. Not that smaller ones! - Smaller ones too take revenge. Others... - Smaller snakes too take revenge. Not snakes! Smaller ones... Like sparrow! Mouse! Fly. - Fly? It'll take. If snakes can, why not flies? Such fools. With whom should I share this problem? How am I to tell? Sir, Bindu madam is here. Out. Sir! Are you alright? Yes, Bindu I am fine. Sit down. And, thanks for coming. What's in your hand? This fly is troubling me. "Bindu! Bindu!" "My Bindu." 'Don't go away from me." Good morning, Mr. Sudeep! What a pleasant surprise? Hi, sir! - Hi! Tell me. How can I help you? I have a small doubt. Do flies target humans specifically? I mean remember humans and attack with a plan. Sir! Are you writing some science fiction story? It is not science fiction. It is a fact. A fly is not letting me to eat, sleep or live peacefully. This accident too is its handiwork! It wrote 'I will kill you' on the windshield. Is it science fiction? You said you didn't sleep all the night. You are in stress. In that stress and sleepiness you have done the accident. In this you are disturbed by fly too. So your brain has registered it as if it has happened. You need a psychiatrist's help. You won't find what you're looking for there. Come. - Go away. You won't come. Fire in iron box. Your face is fully black. That time you'll come to this 'tantra' yourself. Madman. Who is he? Is this my imagination? Bindu! Come have food. What happened, Bindu? Jani's locket got broken. You know Jani won't come back again. For how many days are you going to keep thinking about him? Along with this locket, I want you to break that bond as well. "It's not possible to forget you?" "I'm always with you." Jani! Are you Jani? Are you really Jani? I can't believe it. Jani's rebirth. You died in accident. Wasn't it an accident? Then? Sudeep sir. What Sudeep sir? Did Sudeep sir kill you? Why would he kill you? For me? For my sake he killed you? What should we do now? How to kill him? "What's this fire burning in me?." "There's just one hope in this despair." "The name's Jani." "I'll have you begging for your life." "The name's Jani" "I'll have you begging for your life." "I'm soaring through the skies now" "now I'll write this story with your blood." "I am a fly, don't misjudge me." "I'm the messenger of your death." "I am a fly, don't misjudge me." "I'm the messenger of your death." "I am a fly.." "I am a fly." "I am a fly.." "I am a fly." "You cannot stop me." "With a single spark, you can go up in flames." "A single drop of poison, can do its job." "A single bullet can take life." "This is the universal matter before the big bang." "I'm no ordinary fly that you can get rid of." "I will rest only when you die." "Look into my eyes, I can kill you in a snap." Douse it right now. "I am a fly, don't misjudge me." "I'm the messenger of your death." "I am a fly, don't misjudge me." "I'm the messenger of your death." "There are 10 things that I need to do immediately." "1. I must kill you. 2. I must kill you." "3. I must kill you. 4. I must kill you." '5. I must kill you. 6. I must kill you.' "7. I must kill you. 8. I must kill you." "9. I must kill you." "10. I must make you cry, frustrated, excited." "I must scatter you. I must cut you to pieces and kill you." "Can you hear the music of these two wings?" "Is death message entering through your ears?" "Even a fly's feet will change into spear." "Only after killing you my anger will subside." "Jani is the one who after dying was reborn and smiled." "I'm not a fly to just fly around butter." "To pierce thorn in your chest" "I'm a nuisance who has come as a ghost." "I'm the villain who has come to kill you in your territory." So that's where you hide. It is caught. It is caught. Die. Die. Die. You cannot escape today. Die. What happened? Very good. Excuse me! - Yes, ma'am! Cappuccino to me. For you? Do you also like that only? One cappuccino please. Sorry, ma'am! There is a fly in the coffee. No, no. No. It is drinking coffee. What is the next plan? Come here. - Sir. Did you order the bullet proof glasses? - I have done it, sir. Not just a fly.. even air shouldn't enter without our knowledge. - Yes, sir. I want the entire house air-packed. Yes. Now I'll see how it enters. Please! Sit madam. - Thanks! Bindu! Hi, sir! - Hi. These antiques are very nice. Do you like it? - Yes. This is my personal collection. The place you are standing is wife's favourite spot. What happened, sir? - Nothing. Sure. - Yes. I like your wife's favourite spot very much. Full... Memories. Shall we sit and talk? No. Yes. Sorry! Come. Okay. Sir! Our project. - Urgent. I forgot. I have to urgently go to office. This way. I am.. I thought I'll spend some time with you. Can't you go later? What timing? I won't take much of your time. I think you should leave now. Come. Open the door. I'll see you later. - Okay, sir! "Fly! Fly! Fly! In both my eyes there is fire." "I'll change your house into hell. You wait and see." "Fly! Fly! Fly! In both my eyes there is fire." "I'll change your house into hell. You wait and see." I beg you. Don't spoil this meeting. They have come to invest two thousand crores. If you spoil this, we'll lose two thousand crores. Not only that we'll have to return the 500 crores with interest which they have given as advance. Of course. Don't I know all this? I'm sure you'll like it after our presentation, sir. Sir! This is the latest design. - Have you sent this? Sir! - Yes. - No. It is okay. Gentlemen! We are ready. Will you please welcome our managing director Mr. Sudeep? Don't be surprised. We all know how fond he is of racing. He has symbolically worn this helmet to show that our project would also be completed with that speed. Helmet. - All the best. All the best. Don't put us to shame. It is two thousand crores. Switch it on. Gentlemen! Sudeep's space city. This is going to be the biggest residential township in India. With your investment we have bought 5000 ton steel. 10,000 ton cement. 50,000 ton medicine to kill flies. Over that.. - What? Flies killing medicine? Jelly stone. Why fly killing medicine? Am I scared of fly? Jelly stone. Of course, they can kill flies too. Lights. If someone has to buy our flats each person should kill 5000 flies. How is that? Next, next. After all the flies are dead Sudeep township will be very peaceful. Peaceful, happiness and silent it'll be. Mr. Sudeep! What nonsense? That's enough I say. Is this board meeting or class room to teach how to kill flies and mosquitoes? It is ridiculous I say. Sir.. - I missed it. Mr. Sudeep! Why are you hitting? - Hit won't work. I have used hit. The fly is not dying with that. I know. Have you gone mad? What is he doing? Somebody stop him. - This guy is really... He's a nutcase. - Don't move. Don't move. Wait there. What is he going to do? No, no. Stop it. No. Please, sir! Please, sir! - Sorry, sir! Please sir, listen to me. Please sit, I'll explain everything. Put commissioner on the line. I'll give you a tip. Immediately raid... Sir.. We are caught. That Mukesh Duggal phoned income tax officer. He has told him to raid our office. He tipped him. The entire cash is in the office. Aye! No. Open up. No. Fire in iron box. There will be black stain all over your face. That time you'll come searching for this Tantra. Tantra! Tan... Tantra! I lost everything. It happened as you said. The seed to kill you has been sown here. Here's where I killed Jani. Jani. Fly. It is he who has been born as fly. Don't go close to Bindu. I'll kill you. What you said is true. It is Jani. Now what to do? Immediately veneration has to be done. It's stuck. See there. Don't go near Bindu. Else I'll kill you. I'll kill you. Hello! Sudeep! Sudeep!. What is this? Pot, skeleton, skull. What is happening here? Okay. Whose dead body is that? Tantra's. Why did he come here? - He came to kill fly. Fly, fly. Fly. After all it's a small fly. Will you be scared of it like this? Small fly? Do you know what it can do? You bear it. If you are a man, you bear it and show me. You show it to me. - Get lost. You have gone crazy. - What I'm saying is true. That fly is Jani. The one I killed. He has been reborn. That fly made me suffer an accident. It burnt our money. I made many arrangements so that it must not enter this house. So that even air doesn't enter this house. From where does that fly come? What happened? What is this? Mask, weapons for a fly. Bindu is removing the screw. That means what you said is true. Jani is that fly. Oh my God! Sorry! Even after you told me I didn't believe you. Now we know that Bindu is behind this fly. It is not a big thing to finish her. That I'll manage. But before that the investors have said that they'll finish us If we don't pay money by tomorrow, they'll go to court. First we must stop that. If one of the partners die, the contract will get cancelled. Not only that. We'll get 700 crores insurance money too. What are you saying? For that are you going to commit suicide? Jani! Jani! Where are you? Jani! Where are you? Are you playing hide and seek? Okay. Bindu! Why did you get shocked? Is it because I came upstairs? The door was open downstairs. That is why I came.. Sorry, I scared you. - It is okay, sir. I need to tell an important thing. Will you come with me? - I have to go somewhere else. Please! I hope you won't consider me mad on hearing what I say. A fly is trying to kill me. You don't believe me? And what's more shocking is that.. Someone is helping that fly in killing me. Do you believe it? If you say so.. I'm sorry. When I say this everyone says I'm mad. Come on. Sit down. Look. It's a close circuit camera footage. While zooming in. There is glass, mask on its face. Did you see? Look. Miracle. But how can a fly do all this? Someone must have made it and made him wear this. Hey, don't cry. Silly girl. Nothing will happen to me. These tiny things can be made only by micro artists. Who could be the micro artist who is trying to kill me? I mean you are also a micro artist. Do you know anyone who wants to kill me, Bindu? Sudeep makes girls dance to his tunes. You made me run behind a fly like a fool. Jani! Come out. Come. I know you are here. Like always you come in zig zag way making buzzing sounds. Come and face me. Otherwise I'll cut her throat. Come, Jani! Come. You don't know how I killed him in previous birth. Remove my shoe. I must feel the life going out of your body. Sir! What happened? Go and catch her. You're dead for sure today. He escaped. Where are the bullets? - That was all we had. Drag her here. - I couldn't find her. Did she escape? - No, sir! The doors are closed. Security is also there. The back door is also closed. There is no chance to escape. Find her. He is caught. He is caught. Yes, yes. You made my life miserable for 20 days. And now that you are caught.. That too here. Do you want to believe this? Jani! I'm coming. Please, sir! Please! See how nicely it is flying now. Marvellous. Catch it. Catch it. Prick here. Here. - No, sir! Prick there. - Please, sir! I beg you. Leave us, sir. Please, sir! Please! The game has started. You are telling me to stop it so soon. You both made my life miserable. You asked me to stop. Continue.. Where did we stop? I was laughing. Bindu! You are missing him. Concentrate. You prick in such a way that his heart must be pierced open. Did you think I'll prick him, Bindu? Jani! Okay, okay. Do you communicate to each other? What did he say? What the hell did he say? Don't worry about him. I will kill him before I die. Hell! Burn him and smash him. Will you kill me? Even while dying he can't let go off his arrogance. I'll show him what is burning. Give me the matches. 'My death and my life are for you.' 'I'll give my life and save you. My love!' You'll die. Run! Hi, Babe! What's up? You are looking hot. Oh my God. Let's go. - Don't go near Bindu.. I'll kill you. 'I am a fly.' 'I am a fly, don't misjudge me.' 'I am a fly.' 'The name's Jani.' 'I'll have you begging for your life.' 'The name's Jani.' 'I'll have you begging for your life.' 'I'm soaring through the skies now.' 'Now I'll write this story with your blood.' 'I am a fly, don't misjudge me.' 'I'm the messenger of your death.' 'I am a fly, don't misjudge me.' 'I'm the messenger of your death.' 'I am a fly, don't misjudge me.' 'I'm the messenger of your death.' 'I am a fly, don't misjudge me.' 'I'm the messenger of your death.' 'Now I've lost my cool.' 'Whoever dares to challenge me, won't live to tell the tale.'
