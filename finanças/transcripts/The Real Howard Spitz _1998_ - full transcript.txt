I was out of bullets, but so was the dame. She threw a gun at my head the way suckers in the movies do, but I ducked. She looked through her purse. What if she was carryin'’? What if she was packin'’... a derringer? I saw the knife we'’d used to cut the salami and cheese the night before. I made like Jim Bowie. - It sailed through the air and stuck in her guts with a sickening thud. She screamed once, then went quiet. I checked her purse. No derringer. You win some, you lose some. I got Lieutenant Sutton on the phone. "The so-called missing heiress," I said... "the missing heiress... she'’s bleeding all over my imitation Persian carpet." The case is closed. Soon, I could hear the sirens. Eat your heart out, Raymond Chandler. Yeah, Howard Spitz here. Can'’t come to the phone right now, I'’m... finishin'’ up the new Vance Kirby detective novel. So just leave a message at the beep. Howard. Nicky, your bookie. Well, I got the pen down on No Nemesis. It'’s the last time, Howard! Gotta pay that bill. I hate breaking legs, Howard. It'’s bad for business. Woof. Howard, this is Marla. - Son of a bitch. - I know you'’re there. Howard, pick up the phone, I know you'’re there! Yeah? You know, my new boyfriend is a cop. Yeah, my new boyfriend is a cop. - And he'’s gonna come out if you don'’t give me my money.- Marla, dear, just--just let me stop you right there, all right? Alimony does not grow on trees. ...big loser. -And I hate you, I don'’t know why I married you.-I just finished my new book. The $5000 advance, three grand has your name on it. -I want my money, I want my alimony... -Soon! Oh, I know your new boyfriend is a police, but-- No, don'’t-- -At least, I went back to-- -You'’ll get your money! I want my money, I want my alimony, and your-- Hi. Go away. - Stay close to mummy! Do you like pigeons? Only if they'’re properly cooked. Go away. Tell me a story. I don'’t know any stories. Sure you do. Tell me a story your daddy told you. Please, please, please! Then will you go away? -Yes. -Okay. It'’s one of my old man'’s favorites. Once upon a time, there was a horsey. He was running in a race and he lost. That'’s why we're eating beans. The end. I don'’t get it. I'’m trying to listen to the radio. - Why don'’t you go play with your mother? - -Stop it. -She'’s busy. -Yeah, no wonder. What is she on? Some kinda fertility drug? I don'’t know. They'’re off and racing as they get away... Shut up, listen. ...on the outside to grab the early lead. Go, No Nemesis! Go, go, go! ...move into the first turn, they'’re head to head, neck to neck and bite to bite. -Yes! -as they go over the stretch. No Nemesis, Golden Ryan on the outside, and No Nemesis has pulled up short. He slipped the course and is running backwards! And Golden Ryan goes on to win it with a track record of 155. Followed by Polly'’s big can and my last rites. Gee, just like in your story. Shit. Shit, goddammit! Mummy, this is my new friend. Hello. We have to go now. - Mom, who'’s that? - -Just a strange man in the park. Mummy, are you on some kind of fertility drug? A bagel a day keeps the doctor away. -Hello, Howard. -Lou. I finish a book, I want to sell it. I want to talk to my agent, get his opinion. Find out what kind of deal you'’re gonna make for me. Where do you take me? A dump. Bite your tongue. Were you afraid you'’re gonna have to pay? I always have to pay. You get 10% of my income. Day in, day out. Mostly day out. What'’s wrong with this place? The food'’s good. The place has got atmosphere, charm-- Who ordered the onion bagel? I'’m not deaf. I can tell the difference when someone says onion bagel or egg bagel. Now eat the onion bagel or get out! A bagel a day keeps the doctor away. -You read the manuscript? -I read the manuscript. I think it'’s the finest book I'’ve ever written. I agree. Vance Kirby Draws a Blank. I think the title says, " Crossover." I think we got a shot at the New York Times best-seller list. Maybe even sell the movie rights. -Tell me I'’m wrong. -You'’re wrong. Wrong about what? How am I wrong? No Crossover? No publisher. What are you saying, Lou? Don'’t mince words. -The book sucks. -Okay, mince words. Howard, I warned you. The market for this kind of thing is gone. Robbins Publishing took the first three Vance Kirby novels, $5,000 advance each time. There was a tax write-off. This year, they'’d like to make money. -There are other publishers. -Not for this. Yeah? You don'’t like the food here? - Be calm. Order a bagel. - Go across to the other shop. I don'’t want a bagel. I hate bagels. So what'’d you come for, the scenery? Shut up. Howard, please. I spent the last six months of my life trying to write this book. -The research-- -What research? You just don'’t write about the sleazy underworld that Vance moves in. You gotta research it. You go to the bars. You go to the strip joints. You familiarize yourself with police procedures. You mean, you drink with cops. It'’s called fieldwork, Lou! You think I enjoy drinking? Okay, that'’s not the point. The point is, I'’ve promised $15,000 of my $5,000 advance. By the way, you got a hundred bucks I can have? Let me guess. A sure thing at the 310. Howard, if you'’d saved all the money you'’ve gambled-- Lou, you will never replace my mother. Though you'’re marginally more feminine. There are people out there who are dying to know what Vance Kirby will do next. I'’ve got a cult following. Suddenly, any group under a hundred people is a cult following? Are you gonna sell the book? I'’ll send it around. Out of the goodness of my heart, I'’ll pay the postage. But, Howard, take some advice from an old man. Write something else. These days, it'’s all self-help books. In the old days, you went to the toilet. Now, first you buy a book. Go figure. You'’re not dynamic anymore, Lou. I was never dynamic. Send the book around. It was hot when I brought it out. - Excuse me. I'’m leaving. - You should'’ve eaten it faster. Can I help you, sir? You don'’t seem to have any Vance Kirby novels in stock. Hmm. I don'’t recall those. Vance Kirby Meets the Major. Vance Kirby Makes the Mark. Vance Kirby Inherits Trouble. Soon, the eagerly waited, Vance Kirby Draws a Blank. No, I'’m... not familiar with any of those. Do you know the publisher? Well, I believe it'’s Robbins Publishing. You might try finding it at your local library. "How to breathe correctly." - Boys and girls, I am pleased to introduce the creator of Terrible Tillie, Theodora Winkle. What is the name of your child? Theodora Winkle? You must be joking. Isn'’t she wonderful? I never heard of her. What'’s she written? Oh, my gosh, all the Terrible Tilliebooks. Terrible Tilliebooks. Of course. After Chaucer and Dickens those are my favorites. What is your child'’s name? Excuse me. Back off there, kid. Hey, excuse me, excuse me. Oh, what is the name of your child? I don'’t have a child. Listen. This kids'’ book stuff, there'’s money in this? I beg your pardon. How many of these do you sell? Uh, well, the first book has sold over half a million and the second, third, and fourth have only sold about a quarter of a million each... so far. Oh, is that all? In this country. Of course, there'’s the, uh, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Japanese editions. No Hindi? We'’re working on it. Excuse me, but are you buying a copy of this new book or not? Others are waiting. "Terrible Tillie Goes Down on the Farm." Yeah, sounds terrific, what the heck. How much is it? Two bucks, three? Eight ninety five. Eight ninety five? Holy-- the royalties. Six percent of... nine bucks. Fifty-four cents, half a million. Excuse me, sir. May I ring that up for you? You know, I think I'’ll just try to find this. at my local library. Quarter of a million dollars. God only knows how many yen! You'’re only allowed to check out six. Thank you. Hey, you read, these... these Terrible Tilliestuff? Mm-hmm, they'’re great. I'’ve been reading them since I was little. What'’s so great about 'em? Well, first of all, kids like Terrible Tillie '’cause she's just like us. And she makes up jokes that grown-ups don'’t get, but kids do. And all the stories go real fast, so you never get bored. -They take place in interesting locations, and-- -All right, all right. What are they teaching you at kindergarten? Literary criticism? I'’m in the third grade. You don'’t have to read here, you know. I think there'’s a section for learning-challenged people in the adult section. Do you ever read any detective novels? -Uh-uh. -You should try it. I bet they got some Vance Kirby books here. - Really? - I write those. So, you know what detectives do? Sure. I was one for a little while. Did you find missing people? Yeah. Wives mostly. How much do you charge to find somebody? No, no, it was a long time ago. I'’m a writer now. I don't do that kind of stuff anymore. - Excuse me, sir. - What? - Stewart says you'’re eating... - dog food. Who'’s Stewart? Oh. Well... this isn'’t dog food. Chopped liver sandwich. I'’m sorry, sir. There'’s no eating or drinking in the library. What do you want? A tip? Ew! I'’ll have to check that bag for you. You can pick it up on your way out. We have a special collection for adults who are, um... functionally illiterate. - I am not functionally illiterate! I already told him that. Mister. Stop that. I came here to read, not to socialize. But I need you to help me. What am I, a social worker? Go read your book. Shit! Can'’t be more than 200 words in the whole thing! Now what? Stewart says you said... the "s" word. Oh. It'’s too bad you weren't around in World War 2. They could'’ve used you in The Gestapo. -I think you'’d better leave. -Okay. Okay. Fine. Can I check some of these out to study at home? You have to study them? Will your mommy help you? My mommy died last year. Oh, God. It'’s okay. She'’d had a full life. Come with me, please. Hmm. I'’m telling you, Lou. It'’s a cinch. - It'’s a whole different ball game. What do you know from children'’s books? I'’ve been studying them. What do you mean, what do I know? You think Theodora Winkle was ever married? Much less, has children? - Who? - All right, never mind, Lou. The damn things are short! I can'’t even write that short. Mine will be the epics of the children'’s section. You gotta have a character. I'’ve got a character. Who? Crafty Cow. I hope you'’re not serious. Crafty Cow. Days, she gives milk. Nights, she'’s a detective. Kids go to her when they got problems that can'’t be solved. She uses deductive reasoning. We'’ll make millions! You want me to give up what little reputation I have left in this business? The publishers will say, "From Lou Gaddes I'’m getting a book about a cow." Look, Lou. I live in a crummy apartment which I can afford only because it'’s rent-controlled. Yeah, that'’s right. Five years ago, my wife divorced me, for which the judge saw fit to award her massive alimony. I drink too much. I play cards too much. I am making a pitiful attempt to stop smoking too much. My social life consists of the occasional roll in the hay with a female mud-wrestler, or the equivalent, and I am $15,000 in debt! One shred of consolation in my life was that I was a writer of novels. -Sure, detective novels, but novels. -Howard. And then a few days ago, you tell me that not even that'’s gonna be left for me anymore! Well, I am not going back to being a feature reporter on a fourth-rate newspaper! I am gonna write! If that means going with a goddamned cow, then so be it, but you gotta back me up, Lou. - Yeah. Give him a break, Lou. - Thank you. Yeah, come on. Give him a break, Lou. Hot dog. If you write it, I'’ll send it around. Out of my own pocket, I'’ll pay the postage. But you better not expect too much. Even if they find a publisher, you'’ll have to split the money. -With who? -The illustrator. They'’ll have to find somebody to do the drawings, the cartoons. Split the money? Hello. This is Howard Spitz. Whoever you are, I know I owe you money. You'’ll get it back soon. At the sound of the beep, please don'’t bother me. The gangster was out of bullets. But so was the cow. Who knows from kids'’ books? - Hi, kid. Remember me? - Uh-huh. You used to be a detective, and now you'’re a writer. Yeah. And you love kids'’ books, you know all about them. How would you like to read a manuscript of a kids'’ book? It'’s like a book, but it'’s not a book yet. It'’s just typed. What for? Well, you could tell me what you like about it, what you don'’t like. Give me a kid'’s viewpoint. You mean, like, do you a favor? Well, I guess so, sorta. Okay, and then you have to do something for me. What do you want? To call your lawyer and negotiate a contract? This is a simple little thing. I can get any kid here to do it. Why don'’t you get Stewart to do it? Who? Look. I want you to do it. -I'’ll give you five bucks. -I don'’t want any money. I want you to find my dad for me. What do you mean, find him? Where is he? Ah, If I knew that, I wouldn'’t need you. He went away when I was a baby. Well, actually, before I was born. Oh. What does your mother say about him? She told me he was dead. But last month, I heard her talking to grandma, and grandma said that mom should track him down and make him pay child support, and make him rot in jail. You know, it'’s entirely possible I was married to your grandmother at one point. So I told mom I had heard, and mom said she'’d fibbed. And Dad'’s not dead, but he'’s never coming back. But I bet he wants to. He just doesn'’t know where we are, because we moved three times already since then. Yeah. Look. You read this thing. Tell me what you think. I'’ll see what I can find out about your daddy. Deal? Deal. What? I don'’t think you should have Crafty Cow kicking the little boy. She only stuns him. Okay, okay. I'’ll change it. In this drawing, you have the wrong number of handles on Crafty Cow'’s thing. Well, that'’s not a thing, that'’s an udder. Those aren'’t handles, those are spigots. Well, it doesn'’t look right. Hmm... maybe I should have her wear a trench coat. So, what do you think of the ending? Well, I like it, but I think you should change it. Why? Because parents like to buy books that have happy endings. So you think Crafty Cow should clear the old man, not send him to the slammer. Uh-huh. It'’s corny, but it'’ll sell. I like the way you think. -Are you sure you'’re a child? -Uh-huh. Now it'’s your turn to keep our deal. Oh! Yes? Yeah, my name'’s Howard Spitz. I'’d like to have a word with you. -Who? -Spitz. Howard Spitz. Uh... Could you open the door, please? Well, what is it? Well, it'’s... it'’s a little bit difficult out here. Thank you. Uh, it'’s about your husband. -I don'’t have a husband. -Well, all right. Your ex-husband, then. I don'’t have an ex-husband. If you don'’t get your foot out of my door, -I'’m gonna call the police. -Now, wait, wait, just wait a minute. You got a little girl, right? That'’s it, that's it! Look, I got a gun here, and if you don'’t go away, I'’m gonna use it. A gun. Okay, let'’s be honest with each other, lady. I have no intention of harming you, and you do not have a gun. Okay. -I'’m off the case. -How come? Your mother tried to shoot me. We had a burglary last year. -She'’s kind of nervous. -No kidding. Didn'’t you tell her I was coming by? I tried to. She doesn'’t like me talking to strangers. -She thinks you'’re probably a pervert. -Oh, great. Didn'’t you tell her I'’m not a pervert? I wasn'’t sure what a pervert was. But when mom tried to explain it, you did fit the general description. Thank you. I'’m off the case. We have a deal. Look, you can talk to her right now. She'’s at the supermarket. There'’ll be lots of people there, in case you'’re scared. I am not scared. -What supermarket? -The one that way. Excuse me. You! Look, I told you to leave us alone. -I just wanna talk to you. -I have a gun in my purse. What did you do that for? -Your gun. -I was bluffing. How was I supposed to know that? You threw away my purse! - Are you all right? - Something hit me. - What happened? - Unsafe stacking. That'’s what happened. I saw the whole thing. This poor woman was beaned by a can of soup. Oh, I don'’t think it was a can of soup. If you people would worry a little bit less about your precious profit margins, a little bit more about safety, well, then, this just wouldn'’t happen. My God! There, you see? It'’s happened again. Come on, honey. Let'’s get out of here. This entire aisle is a deathtrap. I'’d sue if I were you. Oh, yes. A can of soup hit me. Oh, I'’m sorry. All I knew was some strange man was talking to her at the library. You know, I didn'’t give her a chance to explain. But her father is not somebody I want to talk about. Hmm, me neither. I told Samantha I'’d ask, and I asked, so... - Okay, bye. - His name'’s Bill. Bill McDonald. He left me when I was pregnant with Sam. Turns out he'’s already married. Oh, well. Yep. Buh-bye. We hadn'’t even known each other that long. Anyway, he freaked out and left, and I haven'’t heard a word from him since. -I told her he was dead. -Uh-huh. So long. Now she'’s got this thing in her mind. If only her dad were around, life would be peaches and cream. She'’s obsessed by it. It'’s all she talks about, all she thinks about. At school, she'’s neglecting her homework, and all she does is daydream. - Well-- -You know, I have done my best. - Really. You know, maybe I haven'’t spent enough time with Sam but-- And you'’ve got no idea where he is? Someone said he moved to California, but I don'’t even know if that'’s true. If Sam could write to him, maybe he'’d write back, and that would put her mind at rest. What do you think? Look. I'’ve got some contacts with the police department. You gimme what you got, I'’ll see if I can find an address on him. If that doesn'’t work out, I could always tell her that I found out he really is dead. Well, I wouldn'’t wanna put you in the position of lying to a little girl. - I don'’t mind lying to a little girl. Oh, back off, lady. Mind your own business. You call these samples? Where are your samples? Where are your samples? Oh, get a hold of yourself. My God, this whole store'’s a disgrace. Hey, George. Malt whiskey. Long time no see, Howard. -What you writing these days? -Oh, Crafty Co-- Nothing. Nothing much really right now. There'’s my man. Ted. Good to see you, man. Thanks for coming. Uh, George, give Ted some scotch here, will you? Okay, what you got for me? Well, I ran a check on him. He'’s been living in LA. That'’s his address, but there'’s no listed phone number. Thanks. I owe you one. So you gettin'’ back into the private eye business? -No. Just doing a favor for a friend. -Ah. -A kid and her mother. -The mother'’s really beautiful? Come to think of it, yeah. It'’s not that way, though. First thing she did was pull a gun on me. They don'’t usually do that to you till the second date. Well, I gotta get home. - Thanks, pal. - See ya. Excuse me. -Have you ever heard of Crafty Cow? -No. You two have a lot in common. Oh, God. I'’m so lonely. Here'’s Bill's address. Oh, I don'’t know whether to give it to her or not. It'’s so hard to know what to do with kids. I think boarding school'’s the answer. Ship '’em off when they'’re five. Let '’em come back when they're old enough to play poker and get drunk with you. The kid wants a father. Why don'’t you get married? I should select someone at random? No, but you'’re not bad lookin'’. You relax that trigger finger of yours, you could probably get some guy to like ya. Well, thank you! If it'’s all the same to you, if I do get married, it'’s gonna be to somebody I'’m in love with. - All right, if you want to be picky. Didn'’t you love your wife? Yeah. She left anyway. -Oh, I'’m sorry. -I'’m over it. I have an idea. Why don'’t you talk to her? She only communicates through her lawyer. No. Sam. Maybe you could talk some sense into her. -Me? -Yeah. She actually likes you. She does? She does. -Go on. -Ugh. Go, go, go. Go on. Sam. What'’s so important about finding your old man anyway, huh? Because all the other kids have fathers. And I'’m sure he misses me, and if he could see me, then everything would be all right. Well, what'’s not so all right right now? I mean, you got clothes, you got a nice place to live, you got a nice mother. Yes, but it'’s not the same as if I had a father. Well, listen, Samantha. Sometimes things aren'’t exactly the way we want '’em to be. Oh, life is still wonderful. Just because some things aren'’t the way we think we'’d like them to be, uh, you gotta leave some room open for, you know, well, for surprises. Where did you get that? Cosby Showrerun. His kid fell for it. Okay, okay. Here. Feed the ducks. So, what if you do find your old man? What do you think'’s gonna happen? We'’d go places like the zoo, and he'’d call me his little princess, and all that other corny stuff that dads do. He would? Sure. Maybe even buy me a pony. You live in an apartment. Isn'’t there something in the lease about no ponies? We'’d keep him in a stable, and I'’d go riding him every day. You don'’t even know how to ride. I'’d learn. When would you find the time? You gotta go to school. I'’d learn even if I had to get up at 5:00 in the morning, every day before school. -You would not. -Would to. Would not. -Did you want a pony when you were little? -No. I wanted a Red Ryder air rifle. Red Ryder was a cowboy in this comic book. They had this air rifle, looked just like a real rifle. I wanted one so bad. -Did your dad get you one? -No. He used to pretend I was Red Ryder. He was tough. Nothing stupid like the Lone Ranger wearing a mask all the time. Gimme a break. He certainly didn'’t sing like that sissy Gene Autry. God. Gene Autry didn'’t even look like a cowboy. He looked like an accountant. Red Ryder. Hey. So, have you, uh, you know, talked? Yeah, sure. Good. Uh, good. So, Sam, can you tell me what you and Mr. Spitz have decided on? - Yes. - Uh-huh. When we find Dad, he'’s gonna buy Mr. Spitz a Red Ryder air rifle. This is his address. A Red Ryder air rifle? With repeating action and a decal of red on the stock. Oh, well. That'’s different. - A bagel a day keeps the doctor away. -So? So, I heard from Primrose Press. - They'’re the number one children'’s publishers. - -And? And they'’ll publish the book. Ah, that'’s wonderful. They want to publish the book. Celebrate. Order something expensive. They even like the drawings. They said they had naive charm. They do have naive charm. How much? They said the idea of a series of detective books for children was innovative and exciting. I think there are a lot of drugs being used in the publishing industry these days. You said, "A series"? They want half a dozen Crafty Cowbooks. Well, that'’s terrific. How much? 10,000 now, another 5,000 per book as an advance. Ten, five times five, 25, 35,000-- Maybe more, if there are toys or a cartoon series. Toys and cartoons? I love it. Waitress! -Champagne. -We have seltzer water. All right. Seltzer water for everybody, on me. Ha. Seltzer water. Yeah. Sign here. And here. I told you I'’ll be with you-- God forgive me for what we'’re doing to their young minds. You know, Lou, you should be happy for me. Hell, you should be happy for yourself. This could be ten percent of a lot of money for you. I'’m happy, I'’m happy. It'’s just that this is the first big deal I'’ve had in ten years, and it'’s from a cow. Publishing was never like this when F. Scott Fitzgerald submitted his work to me. I didn'’t know you represented Fitzgerald. I didn'’t. I told him he should forget about writing novels. Oh. I had that story the wrong way. -I thought you turned down Hemingway. -Him I turned down too. Well, you didn'’t turn down Crafty Cow. Somehow this fails to console me. -Sign this too. -What is it? It'’s a promotions agreement. It says you'’ll make personal appearances to hype the book. Oh. Sure. Why not? What, interviews about how I write? Maybe guest lectures at literary conferences? Signings at the kids'’ sections of bookstores, maybe. Wait a minute. Are you saying I'’ll have to appear where there are children? When you write about a detective cow, you don'’t get on panels with Norman Mailer. Finish signing. You only put down a Howard. We need a Spitz. Lou, I'’m not good with children. Children cry when they see me. Vice versa. Think of them as midgets. - They don'’t call 'em midgets anymore, Lou. - -Huh? They'’re called little people. I like little people. You can drink with them. I dated a little woman for a while. Oh, please, don'’t go into details. You don'’t sign that paper, there'’s no deal. Thirty five thousand dollars. Spitz. What is this role exactly? Uh, you'’d be playing a kids'’ book author. What'’s my motivation? Fifty bucks per half day. You'’re, you're talking to me about money? I'’m talking about my instrument. There'’s no music involved. Buh-bye. Commercials, dinner theater. Guest shot on L.A. Law, Very good. I was a psychopath. I wouldn'’t mention that at job interviews if I were you. I mean, on L.A. Law. I attacked Sifuentes and tore the earring right out of his ear. Highly commendable. I like children a lot. Good resume, Roger. -Do you like kids? -Oh, yeah. Yeah. I got three of my own. You wanna see pictures? -No. -No, you wouldn'’t want-- Tell me. How do you feel about method acting? Look, I, uh, I don'’t get it, really. You know, it'’s kind of, whew. How'’s, uh, fifty bucks a day? The money doesn'’t matter. My wife works. You'’re hired. This is what hell must be like. But this is your public. You know, I think when I finish the Crafty Cowseries, I'’m gonna retire. Do some serious writing. I think I got a great novel inside of me. Do the world a favor. Keep it inside. Thank you. A rejection from you almost guarantees I'’ll be a success. Stand by, studio. Going on air in three, two... Hi, kids. Ronnie Relish here. Oh, time for our part of the show. Why don'’t you go join the other kids? You know, her teacher called me at work today. She'’s not paying attention at all. She just waits for the day to be over so she can run home and see if there'’s been a letter. Oh, Howard. -Are we making things worse? -"We"? You know, we'’ve got a real special treat for you today. Oh, this is the-- Roger. - Roger, Laura. Laura, Roger. The man who wrote it is here to read a bit of it for us. Let'’s welcome him. Mr. Howard Spitz! That'’s you. Don'’t! Hi. Hi. Hello, Mr. Spitz. "Hi. My name is Crafty Cow. That'’s a picture of me. I drew it myself." Yeah. Uh, you might want to-- Oh, yeah. That'’s the cow. -I hope he can handle this. -He'’s a professional. The man can hug a child without recoiling. "And so... Crafty freed the old man, and she said, '’I know you're innocent. I believe in you even if nobody else does.'’" - Aww. - That'’s true! -Isn'’t that wonderful? -It'’s wonderful. I love this man. You know, we were gonna show you another cartoon, but instead, let'’s have a chat with the creator of Crafty Cow. Kids, do you have some questions for Mr. Spitz? What does he know from Crafty Cow? Uh, don'’t worry, he'’ll bullshit his way through it. You got a question. Yeah. Over there. Tell us your name and your question. My name is Lionel, and my question is, Mr. Spitz, how did you come up with the idea of Crafty Cow? Good question, Lionel. Well, Mr. Spitz, how did you come up with the idea of a cow who'’s a detective? Uh, maybe you didn'’t hear Lionel'’s question. What we'’re wondering is how you came up with the idea of a detective cow. Damn it! Uh, well, well, there were crayons involved. And, uh, well, I... what--what it was really was, was just, uh... what-- what it boils down to simply, you know, is... Just bullshit. And we have to take a little break now. -What the hell'’s the matter with you? -I didn'’t know what to say! Just make something up! I can'’t work without a script, I freeze up. I have never been good at improvisation. When they come back from commercial, you'’re gonna tell them exactly how you came up with the idea of Crafty Cow. I am? How? You were driving in the countryside, a lovely cow mooed at you, and that'’s when you got the idea. -Oh, gosh. That'’s nice. -Thank you. Know what I'’m gonna do? I'’m gonna improvise. - Yeah, yeah, I will make you so proud of me. Stand by to go on air. Okay. He'’ll be fine now. Oh, what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive. Bite me. I saw a lovely cow that mooed at me in a field, and that'’s how I came up with the idea of Crafty Cow. Great! Uh, is there any other questions? Yes. The young lady over there. My name'’s Lily. Do you like real cows? Another good question. Well, Mr. Spitz, do you like cows? Yes. Quite a bit. I like cows a lot. You know, I admire cows. That'’s interesting. Why do you admire them? Why? Well... well, because, you know why? Because they'’re--they're cows. And, and you gotta admire that. That'’s something you gotta admire right there because cows, um... give us milk. And milk makes us big, strong, and tall. Doesn'’t it, boys and girls? Great answer. He'’s gonna be all right. Great. Is there anything else you like about cows? There'’s nothing better than a big, thick, juicy steak. No, no, no. - I like mine rare. - Cue cartoons. I guess we do have time to see a little bit of that cartoon after all. Okay. I admit, I admit that steak wasn'’t, you know, the best choice, but in improv class, they tell you to go with the first thing that comes to mind. If I go with the first thing that comes to mind, your children will be orphans. Oh, for cryin'’ out loud. Oh, boy. The moving experience, yeah? The moving experience. What did you do to get out of this junk? Win the lottery or what? Oh, okay. Come on, come on. Oh, oh, no. Oh! For Pete'’s sake, you know, I gotta sleep on this thing. All right. There you go. Come on, come on. - I read your manuscript. - -Oh, good. I don'’t think the puppy should be a Rottweiler. Then why would the neighbor suspect - that he might rip the little boy'’s arm off? - Anything else? - No. Otherwise, it'’s actually pretty good. Try to keep that note of surprise out of your voice. Oh. Truck'’s leaving. You coming or what? So, you said you had some news. -I got a letter. -You did? Well, that'’s, that's great. What did it say? "Dear little princess, I'’m sorry we've lost touch all these years. I do love you, and I think of you often. If I could, I would buy you lots of presents. Even a pony, if you wanted one. The way most little girls seem to. But the truth is that I am doing some very important work for the government, and my identity has to be kept a secret. I will not be able to write again, but I will think of you every day. Be good, and listen to your mother. Your loving Daddy." Well, that is a great letter. So what do you think he does, huh? Think he'’s a spy or something, huh? Don'’t you think? -Wanna see the letter? -Sure. Notice how the "O'’s" are all a little higher than the other letters? Are they? Oh. So they are. Just like the pages of your story. Wow! What a coincidence. Wait a minute. Do you think-- Samantha, I did not write this letter. -You'’re lying. -I am not lying. Do you think I'’m the kind of man who would lie to a little girl? Yes. Well, that hurts me very deeply. I can tell when you'’re lying. Your eyes get all buggy. Have you been talking to my ex-wife? Oh, what the heck. All you'’ve got is circumstantial evidence anyway. So what? We got similar typewriters. It'’s postmarked from just down the street! Ah. We'’re here. Wow. Crafty Cow bought you this house? Ha-ha. Show-off. Nice drivin'’, by the way. Just, uh... - Just be... - be careful with that thing. It'’s a valuable antique. Well, oh, oh, all right. Never mind. Just keep going. Don'’t drop it. Here, here. Earn your money. Sam? Listen. -I was only trying to help. -I know you meant well. Okay, that'’s it. Well, it'’s been wonderful. -Tipping is allowed. -That'’s good to know. - Hey. - Hey, hey. Let'’s go look at the ocean. Tipping is allowed. Tipping'’s allowed. Hey! You know, Sam, maybe he never even got the letter. You know, maybe he moved, didn'’t leave a forwarding address. The person who lives there now just threw the letter away. That does happen, you know? Yeah, but maybe... maybe he did get the letter and he just doesn'’t wanna know me. Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no, no. Sam? Look. You just, just stop that! That'’s-- No crying allowed. All right, all right. Look, I know this guy in Los Angeles. If he'’s not in the slammer, I'’ll get him to see if your dad still lives at that address. Okay? Thanks, Mr. Spitz. I knew you'’d like me. Who said I like you? You and me are friends. Let go of my arm. ♪ Who needs spring To fall in love ♪ ♪ All I need is you ♪ Who needs lambs ♪ And daffodils and swings Hi. Hi. - Nice place. - Thank you. Do you like plants? No. Don'’t really care much for nature. I like to think of it as God'’s first pass. Then He thought about it for a bit, and then He gave us gunpowder and prestressed concrete. -Howard, you'’re hopeless. -Yeah. It'’s still a nice place, though. You should have seen it. It was this hole-in-the-wall. And now look. -It'’s like this little oasis. -How long you had it? Well, just after Sam was born, my mom helped me get the lease and fix it up. She wanted to help me out, and she thought it'’d be a great place to meet a husband. -It'’s hard work though, huh? -Oh, 12-hour days. I used to keep a crib in the back for Sam. I admire hard work. I don'’t do it, but I admire it. You know what? I love it. Oh, there are times when I could scream. There are times when I do scream. But I like knowing that I'’ve done it on my own. You ready? Your chariot and footmen await. -Chariot and footmen? -Well, an Armenian in a cab. Wow. You are really ready. Thank you. Bonsoir. Your first night here? - Uh, yeah. I thought so. My name is Jean-Pierre. I will be your waiter, and I will be serving you. Oh, well, this is Laura. My name is Howard. We will be your customers. We will be tipping you. Maybe. Oh, thank you. Let me know if I can help you with the French. I should'’ve written to Bill first, you know? Check out whether he was willing to write to Sam. You blame yourself for everything? Don'’t you ever do that? No. You knock yourself a lot. Just trying to beat the rush. -Have we decided? -Actually, yes, we have. -You go ahead. -Okay, um... I'’d like the small dinner salad with, uh, oil and vinaigrette dressing, and, the coq au vin and a glass of white wine, dry. -Thank you. -Very good, madame. And does monsieurknow what he wants? Uh, yeah, monsieur will have... a glass of white wine, a salad with French dressing and a hamburger. Monsieur, monsieur, La foret des choux do not serve hamburger. Well, does la foret des choux serve steak tartar? -Of course. -Great. Bring me that, then. You can do that immediately. Don'’t bother waiting on the coq au vin. Go away! We'’ll stay, thanks. - Monsieur'’ssteak tartar. -Oh, great. Thanks. Uh-huh. Thank you. Just a second. All right, now, take this to the chef and have him broil it. - Medium well, and then bring it back. Just think of it as a growth experience. You know, this really isn'’t my kind of joint.

And, I have a cow tie. Three, two... Good morning, good morning, good morning. Oh, this is good tea. Welcome to Breakfast with Red Allen and friends, coming to you live. This morning we'’ll be having coffee and a chat with a very well-established children'’s author. Mm-hmm. And one who'’s just starting out with a hot new book. Welcome Theodora Winkle and Howard Spitz. Thank you. As you all know, Theodora is the creator of the Terrible Tillieseries of books, which have been translated into many languages. Including Hindi. I think the old broad'’s been at the cooking sherry. Lou, how could you think such a thing of Theodora Winkle? I love this tea. And Mr. Spitz has created the hottest new character in children'’s books. Crafty Cow, the bovine detective. He'’s actually been outselling Terrible Tillie two to one. Crafty Cow is no Terrible Tillie, that'’s for sure. I mean, she'’s a damned cow. Ooh! Pardon my French. By the way, is that a toupee or what? Well, I ... I sense a little rivalry here, Howard. What can I say, Red? Crafty and I have been raised to respect our elders, but this lady here has given... years of entertainment to millions of children. That'’s my boy. When did you first start writing for children? When my husband left me. He ran off with his secretary. The bas-- May you both rot in hell. Well, now, getting back to Crafty Cow-- Oh, f-- Crafty Cow. - Commercials. - -And I think it'’s time we break for a commercial. I just got off the phone with Primrose Press. They loved the show! They said it'’s gonna get us more publicity than money can buy. And they want you to go to a big book fair in LA next. The cow is up for The Golden Spectacles Award. -Must have been a slow year. -Yeah. How much prize money? -Oh, there'’s no prize money. -No? But the Primrose Press guy says that if you win, it'’ll triple the sales of the books. - Oh. Great. When do they make the announcement? Well, there'’s an awards dinner following the last night of the book fair. -Black-tie. -Oh, I hate dressing up. -Well, you won'’t be dressing up. -Oh. Roger will be dressing up. - Oh. Oh, right. Yeah, yeah. Better wait for his public. Oh, I love signing autographs, huh? Oh. But don'’t worry. No matter how big I get, I will not forget the little people who helped me on the way up. Thank you. Jealous? Don'’t be ridiculous. I can see it in your eyes. The man has the IQ of a grape. You know, I'’m the one killing myself to kinda make sure he can complete a sentence. He'’s getting all the attention. You got yourself into this. It should have been yourself on TV all along. All you would'’ve had to do is get a shave on a regular basis, a haircut, maybe a face-lift. I know I got myself into this. A little understanding. Is that too much too ask for? A little compassion? Well, I tried to advise you, -but do you listen? Never. -I listen. Then I take into account your track record. You tell me to do something, I do the opposite. - Uncle Howard? - Don'’t criticize me. What have you done with your life? Now suddenly you'’ve got money and you'’re still a slob. -You'’re calling me a slob? -Because you are a slob. -Excuse me. -You'’ve got money and success, so make a life for yourself. What have you done to improve your life? I moved! You turned an ocean-view real estate into a slum. -That'’s progress? -Uncle Howard? I don'’t think this is the best time to talk to Uncle Howard, dear. -But I need to ask him something. -Later. I thank God you turned down F. Scott Fitzgerald. He would'’ve drank himself to death a lot sooner if you'’d been his agent. -Hack! -Parasite!

If you don'’t mind, from now on, I would like to try to keep all my internal organs in roughly, their correct position. -One cotton candy. -I like these rides. Maybe when we'’re in Los Angeles, we can go on a studio tour. You and your mother are going to Los Angeles? Yes. With you. Did I miss something here? You'’re going to the book fair and the TV show, right? -They'’re both in Los Angeles. -Wait a minute. -And so is my dad, see? -Hold it. A letter is one thing, but if I could talk to him... I said, just hold it. I am going to Los Angeles. You are not going to Los Angeles. At least not with me. Thank you. You want to hitchhike, you go right ahead. But if I could talk to him, and he could talk to me, then I'’d know we'll get along. You can'’t know somebody just from a letter. I'’m forming words here, mostly one word. -That word is "no." -Balloon for the little lady? Go away. Hey, mack, lighten up. They'’re two bucks. It's two-- -What a grouch! -He'’s under a lot of pressure right now. If it'’s the money, I'’ll pay you back. - With what? - My allowance. I get a dollar a week. I'’ll pay you with interest. What kind of interest? No! It'’s not about the money. What, then? I'’ll behave. You won'’t even know I'm there. That'’s right. Because you won'’t be there. Okay. -Okay? -Okay. Okay? On the way home, can we stop somewhere? Sure, where? - The Daily News. -What for? Somebody there might be interested in how you get a man to pretend he'’s you on TV. Do you really think anybody at The Daily News is gonna be interested in a piddly little story like that? Yes. It has lots of human interest. Greed. Deception. I can'’t believe this! I am surrounded by vipers. Bad enough I got to deal with that moron, Roger. Now you'’re threatening me? Does everybody hate me? Wouldn'’t surprise me. I don'’t hate you. Actually, I like you. We could have lots of fun on the studio tour. We are not going on a studio tour. That'’s okay. We can just go to the beach. You know what they call this? They call this blackmail. -You know that? -Uh-huh. You are a vile little girl. You are gonna end up in a reform school. I know you don'’t mean that. You will be in a women'’s penitentiary by the time you'’re 18! You don'’t have to go on the studio tour with me. Probably my dad will want to take me. Just the two of us. Listen. There is no way your mother'’s gonna let you go to LA with me. You mean, if she said okay, you'’d do it? Sure, sure. But there'’s no way. So Uncle Howard said that if it'’s okay with you, that he'’ll take me to California, and then I'’ll know whether or not my dad really wants to know me. Don'’t even think about it! I am not the kind of person to be entrusted with a child. I drink. I smoke. Well, I quit smoking, but I think about it every damn day. I play poker to all hours of the night. Well, I wouldn'’t suggest you play poker with Sam, because she'’ll clean you out. I taught her myself. - You play poker? - Yes. Forget about poker! -The point is I am not-- -Howard, I can see right through you. You are a very nice man, and you would protect this child'’s life with your own. Well, that'’s slander. I am not a very nice man. See? We trust you, Uncle Howard. You do? Well, then... Well, then, why don'’t you come too? Look, if... if it'’s the money, I'’ll... I'’ll pay for the ticket. You'’d do that? Well, let'’s call it a long-term loan. I don'’t wanna see Bill. But maybe I should go along, huh? Just in case things don'’t turn out so well. Oh. Oh, no, no, no. -Oh, God! -Thanks, Uncle Howard. Oh. I want to go look through my dresses. I want to look pretty for my dad. This is insane. Has it occurred to you that her father may not even want to see her? He hasn'’t answered her letter. Hasn'’t it occurred to you that this might break her heart? Yes, it'’s occurred to me! It'’s also occurred to me that she won'’t give up until she finds out, one way or another. There'’s no easy way out of this. This is moral blackmail. You'’re a lot like your kid, lady. You know that? I don'’t like you. Yes, well, the fact is, you like me very much. And fortunately, the feeling is mutual. When did I lose control of my life? When? Primrose is arranging for a guy to dress up as a cow. They got the press lined up. They'’re pushing for international editions. I'’ll tell you, Howard, getting into kids'’ books is the best decision we ever made. "We"? Don'’t begrudge me a little credit, Howard. You hated the idea! So, Howard, what do you want from me? Want from you? I can'’t invite my agent to dinner without wanting something? -No. -I want you to come to Los Angeles with me. -Me? -Yeah, you. You'’re my agent. We'’re in this thing together. I want you along. Ah, you'’re nervous about being out there alone with Laura and the kid. I'’m not nervous, Lou. I won'’t be alone. Roger will be there. Roger. Look, it'’ll give you a chance to take a break, you know? -You never take breaks. -Yeah, I take breaks. When my wife was still alive, we went to the Grand Canyon. -It was great, right? -For a hole, it was very large. Come on. Weren'’t you the one saying life is supposed to be enjoyed? Oh, so you'’re paying. Okay. - Okay. I'’ll pay. - Eat the egg roll, or get out. Here'’s your prawn crackers. I'’m ready, Bunny's ready. Let'’s go. Didn'’t you used to go out with a woman named Bunny? Bunny'’s my favorite tea-time friend. I wanna see if Dad wants to know. Oh, there we go. Now, Sam, there'’s one reminder. - Your father may not-- - Save your breath, I'’ve said it all. -Your car is here, sir. -Thank you. I got us a limo to take us to the airport. -Wow, that must be expensive. -It certainly is. That'’s why you all owe me $17.50 each. - What? - I'’m not owing you $17.50.

How '’bout we go to the beach instead? Really? Can we? You hate the beach. If you hate the beach, we don'’t have to go. I love the beach. Come on, get in the car. We'’ll go get your mom. I love the beach. Lou, what factor is this stuff I'’m wearing? Five hundred. Howard, do you know what the point of going to the beach is? There is no point. Thousands of years of evolution occurred so that people wouldn'’t have to sit naked in the sand. The point of going to the beach is to have fun. -Does that word mean anything to you? -No. For God'’s sake, go throw the ball around with the kids. Aw, jeez. - You go throw the ball. - Gimme the ball. These days for me, checkers is a strain. You don'’t wanna have to carry a dead body back to the car. Besides... I'’m not the one she calls "Uncle." Uncle Howard, come on. All right. I'’ll go. Come on, Uncle Howard! But I won'’t enjoy it. Come on. Come on, try it. Hey! You didn'’t catch it. Come on, catch it. Come and see Captain Pugwash, scholastic books, level two. He'’s not coming? What do you mean, he'’s not coming? I need him here. Things are going to start. I'’ve got kids here. - Howard. -Do you know what this is going to do to us if he doesn'’t show up? -How'’s it goin'? -Oh, great. Except for that guy from Primrose Press. Very upset. That'’s him, that's him. It'’s a catastrophe. What? What? The actor who was supposed to play Crafty Cow hasn'’t shown up. I called the agency, and they don'’t have any idea where he is. Who... who are you? Howard Spitz'’s personal manager. This is Laura and Sam, our floral consultants. And this is Lou, his agent. Lou, we'’ve talked on the phone. -We'’re all dead. -Huh? What is the big deal? The big deal is that we have people here from all of the major papers. They brought their kids to be photographed with Crafty Cow. Do you know what kinda publicity we'’re going to get if their kids go home disappointed? -Have some other guy wear the cow suit. -It starts in ten minutes. Where am I going to find someone? ...runny nose, report to information right away. -It'’s too big! -Oh, come on. It'’s fabulous on you. It'’s too big. I'’m the writer. It'’s too big for me too, or I'’d do it. Oh, yeah, me too. Way big. It looks like it'’s about your size. Oh, who asked you? - It'’ll sell a lot of books. -She'’s right. It'’ll look great on ya. Wait a minute. It'’s perfect. You pose with the kids, you moo a little. No way! Then we'’re finished. Bad reviews from these people is going to cost us big bucks. -Tens of thousands. -Tens of thousands? If not, more. Would you like a hot dog? Get your picture taken with Crafty Cow. Come to booth 12. Oh, yeah, what a joy. - Could you maybe skip a little? - Do a little dance? - -Don'’t push your luck! Come on. Come on. Oh, oh, no. Oh, hurry it up. He'’s leakin'. Mr. Spitz, there'’s someone asking to see you. He'’s over by the hot dog stand. I think I'’m busy. It'’s a Mr. McDonald. Bill McDonald. Bill McDonald? Never heard of him. Ta-ta. I'’ll take care of it. Here. Lead the way, kid. Hot dogs, hot dogs. You want a hot dog? That'’ll be $1.79. Hot dog, please. - Howard Spitz? - $1.79. Are you Bill McDonald? Look, I came because I didn'’t want you coming to my house again. Thank you for coming. But why didn'’t you answer Sam'’s letter? I was scared. You know, this isn'’t about money. I know it'’s not about money. I wish it was. I don'’t have much, but I'’d give 'em what I have. - All Sam wants-- - I know what she wants. She wants me to say she'’s my kid. She wants me to be... Kelly, age 6, is at information, looking for her parents. Would you report in? I'’ve got a wife. Kids. My marriage is not in great shape. If my wife found out about this... make something up. Tell her I died. Tell her whatever it will take to make her give up on this, okay? It'’d be better for her too. I'’m sorry. I don'’t want to see Samantha. I don'’t have anything to give her. It'’s your loss. She'’s a pretty wonderful kid. I'’m sorry. So am I. You'’re a cow, so you give milk, right? - Yeah, that'’s right. - Yeah, that'’s right. - I wanna see you give milk. - -Hey! Smile. Get off of me, you rotten kid. - That'’s the last one. - Well, thank God. Get out of my way. Get this thing off of me. Now that wasn'’t so bad, was it? All children should be shot. Come on, hurry up with this thing. You'’ve got an hour to rest at the hotel, and then we'’ll come back here for the awards dinner. I'’m having trouble with this zipper. Lou, it'’s 112 degrees in here! That pull thing is folded under. -My fingers are too big. -Yeah, mine too. Sam could do this if she were here. Yeah, let me try this again. She must be back from the hot dog stand by now, huh? - Sam was at the hot dog stand? -Yeah. When? When? Just after you went off. I was talking to Bill. Bill is here? -Did Samantha see him? -I sure as hell hope not. I got it, I got it, I got it. -Oops. -All right, never mind. Laura, go have them make an announcement telling Sam to come back here. Lou, you stay here in case Sam comes back. Lawrence, keep an eye on Rog-- Er, Howard. Make sure he gets to that ceremony. Don'’t let him out of your sight. He'’s a moron! I don'’t know about that. Hey, did you see a little girl, yellow ribbon in her hair? Yellow ribbon in her hair. Samantha Kershaw, age 7, -with a yellow ribbon is missing. -Yeah. -If you know her whereabouts...-Yeah, I think I did see her. Yeah, she was crying. She ran right outta here. Well, why didn'’t you stop her? Well, I didn'’t know, I was... Because you'’re a moron, that'’s why. God, I'’m surrounded by morons. I don'’t have to take that kind of talk from a cow. Get out of my way! Sam! Sam! Oh. Not acro-- Oh! Oh. Oh! Hold up! - Excuse me! All right, uh... I'’m looking for a little girl. You gotta keep an eye on them. I don'’t even let 'em in my store half the time. Little girl, eight years old. Yellow ribbon in her hair. -Was she cryin'’? -Yeah. - Yeah! - Which way did she go? Oh, she went down there, but... but I wouldn'’t go in that neighborhood. That'’s a tough neighborhood. You don'’t' wanna go down. Thanks! Oh, Sam. Oh, God. Excuse me! Look out! -Excuse me. -Hey! - A cow stole my bike! - Sorry, kid! Oh, oh. Oh, God. Ah! Oh, fine. What next? Yup. Uh-huh. Sam! All right, cool, cool. Huh? Excuse me. I don'’t know 'bout y'’all, but... Oh, God. Oh. Oh, no. Sam, what are you doing up there? Give me your hand. Oh. Go away. Oh, God. I'’m about to fall to my death here. Don'’t you care? No. Oh. I suppose you'’re wondering... why I'’m still wearing this outfit. -No. -Well, my head got stuck. Oh, God. Oh. I don'’t wanna have to go through life this way. I was hoping somebody might help me with the zipper. I was hoping that might be you. Please? Thank you. Oh. Thank you very much. Oh, oh. Oh. So, uh... You, uh, come here often, do ya? I wanted to get away from everybody, including you. Yeah, well, I was thinkin'’ maybe tomorrow we should go do one of those studio tours. You go. I don'’t wanna go. I guess you overheard your dad and me talkin'’, huh? It doesn'’t matter. I don'’t care. I know how you feel. No, you don'’t. Don'’t say that. He'’s my father, and he doesn'’t even want to see me. He'’s scared. Yeah, scared that his wife'’s gonna find out. I heard. Well, I'’m gonna call his wife and tell her everything. That'’ll show him. Yeah, that'’s a good idea. Maybe she'’ll get so mad at him, she'’ll leave him. -Good. -Yeah. Sam, he'’s got kids. Other kids, I mean. Maybe after he and his wife split up, the other kids won'’t be able to see him very much either. I mean, yeah, that'’ll show him, but, uh... might be kinda hard on the kids, huh? I don'’t care. Why should I care about him and his kids? He didn'’t care about me. I hate him. I hate him, and you, and everybody else. -No, you don'’t. -Yes, I do. He wanted to lie to me. Everybody lies. My mom lied to me, she said he was dead. You lied, he lied, everybody lies. Yeah, they do. Sometimes they do that '’cause they can't think of anything else to do. Sam, for what it'’s worth... I promise I'’ll never lie to you again. What do you know about telling the truth? You lie all the time. You even lie about who you are. You'’re the biggest liar of all. And so, ladies and gentlemen, it gives me great pleasure to introduce our host for the rest of this evening. The one and only winner of last year'’s Golden Spectacles Award, Balthazar Mishkin! Creator of the wonderful, wonderful, wonderful... Chickens Never Forget. Thank you, sir. Thank you. The Golden Spectacles Award for the best children'’s book of the year. And the nominees are... Dear S. Salt by Vladiana Krikorkov and Raffi Martin. Farmer Joe'’s Hot Day by Nancy Wilcox Richards and Werner Zimmerman. Terrible Tillie Bites the Dentist by Theodora Winkle. Unfortunately, Theodora Winkle will be unable to join us this evening. Shame. As she is in India, completing the Gujarati version of her latest book. It'’s about time. And the final nominee is, Crafty Cow and the Missing Puppy by Howard Spitz. And now, if we will all don our golden spectacles, I will read the name of the winner. ♪ It'’s a golden spectacle ♪ - This is exciting. This is like the Oscars. And the winner of this year'’s prestigious Golden Spectacles Award is... Howard Spitz for Crafty Cow. ♪ It'’s a golden spectacle ♪ Well, that'’s quite a... quite a grip there, huh? Do you milk cows? Only Crafty. Now, how did this whole Crafty Cowthing get started? How? Um, well, I was... I was driving across country, and I stopped somewhere in Nebraska, and there was this field of cows. And one of them, one of them mooed at me, and I was struck by inspiration. And that'’s when I knew I had to write and draw this cow. Probably, just like Leonardo Da Vinci thought, when he first saw Mona Lisa. My books are the epics of the children'’s section. Why do you think the kids and the parents have taken Crafty Cow to heart? There'’s something very basic and comfy about cows. You know, the cave drawings were originally cows. So when I tap into Crafty, I'’m tapping into something actually quite primeval. - The books are published all over the world? - -Oh, hell. Yes, yes, and I personally-- I'’m sorry to interrupt, but this man is an impostor. Uh, ladies and gentlemen, if this is a joke, I'’m not in on it. Who are you? I'’m the real Howard Spitz. Who'’s he? He'’s just an actor. I find this all very embarrassing, and it'’s not true. Well... Well, now I don'’t know what to think. Lou, Lou! -Come on up here! -Oye. Mr. Lou Gaddes, a semi-respected literary agent. Lou. Tell '’em which one is the real Howard Spitz. He is. Ha-ha, thank you so much for coming out. What do you think you'’re doing? You'’re throwing it all away. Finally, I'’m making some money. Finally I get my daughter'’s teeth fixed. Your daughter'’s 53 years old! So I'’m getting her dentures. Sam. This is the real Howard Spitz. He'’s telling the truth. Who... Who are you? Samantha Kershaw. Samantha, how can we prove which one is Howard Spitz? In Crafty Cow and the Missing Puppy, what does Crafty Cow give the puppy? A milk bone. No! Oh, no. What am I thinking? That'’s another book entirely. That'’s, uh... I was thinkin'’ of, uh, a ball? No! Okay, I don'’t know! I write them, I don'’t read them, all right? We should talk about the cave drawings. I know a lot about cave drawings. She gives him a little hat. It was Samantha'’s idea. In fact, uh, Sam'’s helped me with all of the books. Has anyone read the book? Is it a hat? Yes, it was a hat! That'’s right! Yes, a little hat. Well... I guess we found out who the real Howard Spitz is. You can go now. I'’m a much better Howard Spitz than this guy is. Howard, why did you hire this guy to pretend he was you? Well, I, uh... I just didn'’t think I was, uh... a good enough role model for the children of America. All right, all right! Kids give me the willies. Got your onion rings up. Onion rings. - Four ninety nine. - Okay. Hello, Lou. How are ya? So? They talked, I listened. Crafty Cowmay not be finished. If you pay back 15 grand, Primrose may keep it going. But, Lou, I spent that money already. We'’re all gonna have to make sacrifices. My daughter'’s gonna have me give back her dentures. I don'’t wanna write this sitcom garbage anymore! I'’m gonna be a playwright! Do you mind? Look, there'’s more to life than money. I'’ve got my integrity, and my soul is worth more than $16,000 per half hour. Sixteen thousand dollars? For what? For a stupid sitcom script. -How long'’s a sitcom script? -40 pages. Lou, that'’s it. It'’s a cinch. It'’s a whole different ball game. What do you know from sitcom scripts? A married couple, a sofa, a couple of wacky neighbors. A bar in Boston, a psychiatrist on the radio. Anybody can write that stuff. Lou, $16,000 per episode, plus reruns. -Of course, if you don'’t wanna handle it-- -No, no. You write it, I'’ll send it around. Out of my own pocket, I'’ll pay the postage. ♪ I'’m sitting On top of the world ♪ Samantha, I'’m not your dad. I'’m not anybody's dad, thank God. But, uh, well, when we get home, if you'’d like somebody to hang out with, you know, go do stuff like the movies, that kind of thing, uh, I got time. Okay. And that, uh, goes for you too. You'’re so romantic. I thought you were waiting for love at first sight. Oh, I don'’t think I'’m waiting for that anymore. You'’re not? How come? Things change. Does this mean you'’re gonna buy me a pony? Absolutely not! A puppy? A goldfish, if you'’re lucky.

Just make something up! I can'’t! I freeze up without a script. I'’ve never been good at improvisation. Listen, make a plan, you'’re gonna tell them exactly how you came up -with the idea of Crafty Cow. -I am. Yes, so'’s the hamburger! Oh, goddammit. Crafty Cow. Days, she gives milks. Nights, she'’s a detective. Kids'’ll go to her when they have problems that can'’t be solved. She'’ll use detect-- Oh, poopy stink, I am completely all over this text. I could shoot myself!

Well, I try to advise you, but do you listen? -Never. -I listen. Then I take into my mind. Then I reflect on the kind of advice-- Your kind of track record that you got, then I just do whatever you tell me to do, something I blow it out my-- - Okay. - Action! Hi, George. More whiskey. Long time no see, Howard. Yeah. What you writing these days? Well, actually, clar-- Uh, poopy stink. That'’s what I'm writing. And there'’s my phone. Hang on a second. This is perfect. Excuse me. You... You? -Look, I told you, just leave us alone. -I just wanna talk. I have a gun in my bag. What? What the hell are you doing? ♪ Go, go Go, go ♪ ♪ Go, go ♪ Get crafty Crafty Cow and the Missing Puppy, by Howard Spitz. Hi, my name is Crafty Cow. That'’s a picture of me. I drew it myself. I'’m sorry it's not very good. It'’s hard to draw with a hoof. No duh, you can'’t even hold a pencil. For a long time, all I did was graze and give milk. Sometimes I said... One day, I decided I wanted more from life. I remember what my mom told me when I was little. She said, " Crafty, you can be anything you wanna be." I wanted to be a detective. I moved to the city. I put up a sign and waited. And waited. And waited. One day, a little boy came to me for help. "Crafty, I'’ve lost my puppy," he said. Boy was crying. "Don'’t be so upset," I said. Will you stop crying if I help you find your puppy? I started crying too. Blank, don'’t you have any heart? Well, he misses his puppy. We had to find the puppy. " Where is the puppy?" I asked the pigeon. "Where is the puppy?" I asked the cat. "Where is the puppy?" I asked the dog. Well, thank you very much. Nobody knew where the puppy was. Do you think one of them was lying? The cat was nervous. "Tell me what you know," I said. "The puppy'’s hiding in the alley," the cat said. He asked me not to tell you. The boy and I found the puppy hiding in the alley. "Why are you hiding?" I asked. "Because I'’m sad," the puppy said. " Why are you sad?" I asked. "Because an old man stole my hat," the puppy said. I tracked down the old man who had stolen the puppy'’s hat. I gave the hat back to the puppy. The old man was crying because he did not have the hat. I gave my hat to the old man. And that is how I solved my first case. I like being a detective. What do you wanna be? I'’ll see you when I solve my next case. Goodbye. Maybe the old man should'’ve ended up in the slammer. You think so? Little late now, now that I'’ve changed it. Poopy stink.
