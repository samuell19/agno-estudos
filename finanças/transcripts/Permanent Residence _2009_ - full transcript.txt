Don't lie to me That's curriculum of secondary school. Lazy student Review that for me then Listen According to the evolutionism ln any large tribe, there is a minority out of ordinary They will be repelled and suppressed by the mainstream They can survive only if they are more brilliant Eventually, their merit will spread out... and become mainstream Then a cycle of evolution is completed You mean... Gay is a merit and everybody will become gay one day? Exactly By the advancing of science We even have test tube babies now The vanishing function of heterosexual reproduction... could be a sign... l suppose you are right You are outstanding, but... You are still a minority now and should be suppressed by me l will beat you up first How dare you Are you crazy?

Kelly and l have been together for long But every time l see her, we are like criminals We can't even go to hotel because they don't admit unmarried couples lf the police break in, they will charge me visiting a prostitute How can that be a reason to marry? l reckoned you won't understand. You are unrestrained As a man, l have to get married and raise a family someday As a man! Sorry Don't misunderstand me We are different. l can't meet your expectation But l respect you as my best friend You... Can do things you don't want to for others Just can't do it for me lvan, don't force me You know how l feel about you Besides that, l can even die for you So to stay with me is worse than death You are nonsense again. Troublesome as a fucking bitch Why do you have to tell me that... at such moment? lt is the last hurdle lvan, you can do it Hey mate, you are still alive! Happy birthday! Oh...hi, how're you doing?

Ivan has his network, he can help us lvan is a good boy for sure l wish Windson can be half as brilliant So be good! Go and see Dr. So, alright? lt will be expensive l am his frequent customer, he will give us discount By the way, Windson will blame me if you don't go That silly boy is always so impulsive anyway OK. l will go... with you anyway The weather is so strange nowadays Yes, the earth is changing People are changing too. There was no such thing as cancer before l merely... ate a preserved apricot Then l got this endless cough lt is not because of preserved apricot, aunt What else then? l don't smoke. Dad doesn't smoke And Windson doesn't smoke He does Really? l haven't seen him smoke at home You know him better than us Tell him don't smoke too much then But that may not matter at the end Look at me, smoking or not, dying the same lt is not that easy to die, aunt lt is Faye, our neighbour Who talks like thunder One day, she just fell, and that's game over for her l am not afraid of death Windson will take care of his dad anyway And with friend like you But l am reluctant to go l work hard all my life, and as soon as it is getting easier The end is ahead. Anyway Aunt, you will recover, believe me lvan, don't try too hard l don't want you to spend your hard earned money AIl on the elderly But haven't you spent all your money on us? That's also true, so you should appreciate your life Don't imitate the girl of today's headline Just had a quarrel with her boyfriend Then she iumped from a roof. How stupid! l heard this cinema is going to end its business Old stuff won't last Have you watched Cantonese opera here? Sure.

Never get sick We don't have much choice now Except a new medicine from Australia lt is tablet. No side effect. Worth trying But so expensive that we are reluctant to mention l don't care about the cost. Just use my credit card But don't let mom know the amount She is lucky to have a son like you Tang Mui. You may go now This doctor is different, must be very expensive Not really. He said you are cute and gave us 500/o off Really?

Such as what is your dad's name? l was already reluctant to answer, and your grandfather's? l said l hardly even know him, l don't even know where his grave is! l warned you so Yes, fortunately, othenNise l would be... even trickier and be locked up already Well we all know they can be real nasty But when every life is at stake here Nobody blame them for doing their job l guess l will understand that in times, but, where are we going now? Tel Aviv is iust like Hong Kong, l am bringing you to Jerusalem Great Magnificent The holy place for Christian, Islam and Jews Look at all those graves They were for the lucky ones What do you mean? There have been so many not so much loved people Like my ancestors They don't even have a half square meter to bury The Mount of Olives is... a very special place for the Jewish people Why is it different to other places in Jerusalem? For three thousand years, the Jewish people bury dead people here The book of the prophesy said, people buried here will become alive first When the end of the time comes lnteresting Yeah You know what this is? Yeah, the Wailing But l had only seen it on film There is no film like life Right l can't believe it Nobody can at the first sight of it. What attract you the most? Everything is still Look!

It is also the lowest place on earth And keeps getting lower That fits pe_ectly No wonder Windson says he prefers to be buried in the sea Oh After a life that changes so much lt would be a blessing to be able to remain this way forever, permanent, eternal... So Ivan, aren't you going to tell me What happened at your birthday night, when l called you? Oh yeah, so you noticed You sound like you were about to jump from a roof Oh my god, l did not have a webcam on the roof, did l? So you were really...crazy fellow Did you break up with him? Just then, 3 days after my grandma passed away Josh, you might have saved a life l shouldn't have called you then Why? You have lost the love of your life. That is sad But that also means you have had love People who love you and loved by you so much You think you have lost it, but you already own it forever Can't you see iust how lucky you are comparing to... And you even want to give up such a life, why should one bother? Sorry mate This is not how a host should treat his guest friend Now back to your affair with your dream boy How did it fail? l think it was totally my fault l have pushed him over the edge When he is in trouble himself Forced by his girl to get married l see. So you were jealous How did the sex go? Nothing. None. Never. No Nothing happened after sleeping together for so long? He is so resistant, too masculine to be a bottom And refuses to get on top of me There is iust nothing we can do But at least you can use your hands and mouth You are not telling me... l am such an idiot. l totally lost it. l must be sick! Hasn't anyone told you that Passion is a terminal disease? So have you been sick before? Many times, well, twice, but twice too many So Josh, tell me Which refusal is worse?
