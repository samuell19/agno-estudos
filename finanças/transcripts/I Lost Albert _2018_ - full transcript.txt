A singer undergoing chemotherapy She's asking me if she should accept an opera next year It's really important Stop it! "Hello, it's Damien Grimal I'm not available" Damien, I know it's not always easy to be in a relationship with a medium I'm sorry if I was too harsh on you But I'm having big problems with Albert Before, he was just jealous but now... Call me I need... I need to trust you Fuck! Pain in the ass "Albert Einstein, you have said "I believe in life after death" - "because energy..." - "Cannot die" It morphs, it circulates It never stops Then, tell us, what will you do when you die? What I failed at while I was alive Educate a child and make him happy Stop all wars Help human beings to love each other more and to control their future - and save the bees - Bees? Why the bees? 80 percent of fruits and vegetables can't reproduce without bees I have done the math The day the bees will disappear mankind will only have left four years to live "Kindly, verify..." What an honor? You came to pick me up yourself I'm a good editor I'm going with you to the radio We will have enough time to talk about my divorce Regarding what you felt last week I'm wondering if I should renegotiate... - Are you all right? - Yes I didn't eat anything since yesterday noon Come, we have enough time Everything is looking very good for this evening An interview like this on the eve of the book's publishing It's great - Waiter - I'm coming right away Dedicate it to Roland Buech Roland Buech? The psychoanalyst? He's a commentator in tonight's episode of Verite Oblige It's excellent, for the audience But, he's vicious He doesn't believe in anything He would do whatever he can to belittle me Predict for him something personal and that will shut him up It's not my job I'm not a circus show, let's cancel it I understand but read your contract If you refuse to do the promotion You have to reimburse me a partial disproportionate payment that you have made me pay for the cystic fibrosis Excuse me, yes? No, sir I have personal reassurances that Isabelle will accept the shared custody - I want a coffee, please - Is that all? Don't leave Hello, yes? Hey, listen Chloe - I think we should stop - Stop what? Us? I feel like you're sad because of me I'm blaming myself and... You're worried about my professional reputation? "It would be bad for me if your boss finds out" I made him hire a loser just because he's my lover? It's not fortune telling anymore it's paranoia There's something wrong with you Chloe Bastard! I'm not leaving you for another Chloe I just don't love the woman you have become "You have another call" Answer it, it's very urgent for sure You are not leaving her for another woman? "Yes, it's your mother, I have been trying to call you for an hour" My washing machine stopped working this morning "Which brand gives you a good vibe?" "Bosch, Samsung, or Siemens?" - Buy the most expensive one - "Thank you honey" - I will call you later - Mom, wait - I'm not good, please... - And next time when you're Nice Let me know beforehand I have four important people I promised them a consultation You have to see them What will I look like otherwise?

"The president of the risk prevention commission" "all the experts are official" "There hadn't been any weapon warehouse" "What was it? A wrong target?" "Who do you trust, Miss?" "The armed forces of the free world or the terrorist propaganda?" "A comment about the resignation of General Beck" "the deputy director of the NATO operations" - "No comments" - "Thank you" Excuse me, can you drop me off at the Saint-Jack clinic? Is there something wrong? "Let's jump straight away to the weather segment" - Waiter, I have a train - I'm coming, Miss - I want... - I... One Peruvian salad, one falafel Two yakitori, two GreenWay One red Sancerre wine - Right away - How did he guess? - I want a double espresso - In a big cup with a bit of hot water Just like your grandfather My grandfather? Why are you talking about my grandfather? He just told me that he's your grandfather - No, sir, it's impossible - I don't understand Yes, you do understand You just talked to me in French with a German accent He just told me that at least he should be free to smoke Please explain to him that if we're on the rooftop we're not in the station I don't have the right to do that Excuse me but he's your grandfather My grandfather just died Wait a second I just heard him say "He's good and he says thank you for his young girl" - I don't allow you - Who is talking to me? It's a disgrace! I'm mourning, Sir He's saying thank you for what? For the Nazis? For the euthanasia Miss, come back, come back! Zac, what's going on? You're bothering the clients now? What's wrong with me? That's what I'm asking you Thank you, Chloe Thank you You have done a helluva job not telling me about this accident I know you predicted it but if you would have told me I would have paid attention before crossing the road And I would have ruined the best moments of my marriage Sebastian has never been so nice In hardships we know the true feelings of a person Sit down I sent you a message just to stay discreet They want to open me up to put an implant Who should do the operation? Moulin or Hokaido? - I should see their photos - I have better than that Hokaido's glasses and Moulin's pen On one side, I'm safe with Moulin he has the experience I trust him We eat lunch on the bay together every Saturday But on the other hand Hokaido is young and he has the Japanese attention for detail Who do you think is better, Chloe? Moulin or Hokaido? Hokaido, I also have a good feeling about him By the way, Moulin is overwhelmed He recommended his assistant I will tell them that I found these on the ground That they lost them while checking up on me This is itching me it's bothering me But isn't it a risky to just leave it here? Are they going to steal it? Who? I... I don't feel well I'm going Save yourself, yes, quickly Thank you for passing by even though you're on high demand You're really the best the most reliable Hello again, my love A quick drink in front of the TV? Here you go "Good job with the shoe factory" No one thinks it was a wrong target Really? And thanks to you, NATO has replaced General Beck It was long overdue! A strong career but he's very old "Are you still going to see" "the Princess of Qatar the day after tomorrow?" How do you know that? You're not my only source of information, Chloe Well, it's crucial that your client persuades the Emir to condemn Moscow's position It's not in my powers, sir "Yes, you will tell her" "My voices are telling me..." and that's it That isn't how a medium consultation goes "Mrs. Delmart, I remind you that you're under a contract" with the European Union and that it's an order She makes me mad She's beautiful but very nervous - Good morning, Miss - Good morning I'm sorry to barge in but I saw you in the news I present myself, Professor... - Moulin? - You're really good A very old friend of mine is always talking about you and praising you - The... The... - The Couidec? Yes! Yes! Between us, how will her leg operation go? Better, better I'm saying, right now, good Excuse me - Yes? - "Chloe, the taxi is in hurry" "and your live interview is starting in quarter to the hour" Madam Le Couidec I have passed her on to Hokaido But, I will do the operation Hello, Chloe, how are you? How did the radio go? Not well, how many are there? One at 2:30 pm and one at 3 pm Your 4 pm appointment is late but your 4:30 pm will be early We have a problem, Nelly - I can't see anything - Nothing? Albert isn't sending me any information He's just in a bad mood he will start again Do you remember when you started dating a German soldier? When he's mad at me I get the migraines But I'm feeling good Everything is off but I'm feeling fine as if I'm on a vacation Nothing on my mind there's absolutely nothing Assistant of Chloe Delmart, hello Don't hang up, thank you Madam Le Couidec-Mertens Tell her I have an emergency with a foreigner I have to talk to you, Zac You accused a client of killing her grandfather and you tell another one that she's a cheater and you don't let old people order champagne telling them to go bright in the morning to the emergency room Are you trying to bankrupt me? My younger brother She's the boss Nice to meet you Wait a second Guillaume's brother just lost his job You certainly won't fire me without notice for a professional misconduct and hire him in my stead Me? I would never think about doing something like that But... Is there something wrong? Zac, are you all right? I just lost my job - It's not honey, it's wax - I know It's clogged What? The Ry d'Argent 2008? It's impossible Not the Ry d'Argent, the bottle on the right, Chateau-Les-Cranes - Chateau-Legrand? - He's saying that Yes, because the wine bottles are speaking to you too - "Help me, sir, I'm clogged!" - No, it's not like that I'm hearing a voice, one voice The same voice all the time telling me everything that's going on around me Like what? Joan of Arc? An old man who has a soft voice and an accent It's the cop frequency, the Wi-Fi I don't know disruptions in your cellphone No, that's not it He's telling me what everyone is thinking what are their names and will happen to them He sends me photos as well Really? What's going to happen to me? You will make fun of me and give me an expired foie gras Yes, it's good you mentioned it Two days after the expiration date won't kill you Olivier, you have gone to medical school for three years Tell me honestly am I losing my mind? No, but you should do some tests You may have a compression in the right temporal lobe It can cause altered states of consciousness illusions, mystical visions extra-sensory perceptions And can a person become a fortune teller just like that suddenly? Look, people are so stupid you can make some money Because I'm sorry but I can no longer sell your honey All the customers are returning it they find it yucky Because it's real honey I don't add any sugar You should What else is wrong? You should see your mother more Why? It's beautiful the renovation of the park They can I see that they increased your monthly payments I'm costing you too much, Chloe It's nothing You rarely come during the week Is everything good with your lover? No, and that's not the problem What's wrong Chloe? You seem not yourself - I lost Albert - Lost? He isn't here anymore He's not talking to me anymore He isn't letting me predict anything I have warned you He wanted you to disarm the planet, Chloe But not by using bombs, come on! Chloe, you have been using it for years You have been disturbing him and asking him things he has nothing to do with And you're sad He couldn't carry on living with you Excuse me "General or local anesthesia?" "Local" Did you think about it, my love? Are you sure you want the local anesthesia? Don't you prefer to be completely asleep? I like it better when you wake me up Let's go See you later, Mr. Le Couidec Hurry up! Georges, what should I do to make Albert come back? I don't know You really want him? We have lived together for a long time I can't be alone like this I'm nothing without him No one loves me for who I am Everyone is using me And it's unbearable this silence Maybe it's a necessary test a step in your evolution He will come back once you overcome it I will appear on Verite Oblige tonight with Roland Buech I should cancel it No, on the contrary rise to the challenge If you're at risk Albert won't let you fail What if he's gone for good? Maybe he left me for someone else We may need him too That doesn't mean he's cheating on you He's just sleeping out Why are they dying? Why are they killing each other? What do you mean, "I will see"? What will I see? When will I see it? I want an answer now Right away! "Shut up!" "Fate is wild" To think I'm doing your makeup! Can I ask something? A guy named Cedric invited me to dinner Saturday Make an appointment with my secretary I did, but it's in 3 months Sorry, I'm booked until then All I want to know is should I say yes or no for Saturday? Say yes He won't wait 3 months Thank you! - Ms. Delmart? - He's not "the one". Is he? Give him a chance Coming She's the best psychic around! Except that clairvoyance doesn't exist "He was forced..." "NATO's mission is not..." "Yes" From what I have read you're what specialists call "a channel" Through which someone speaks to you from the spirit world - Is that right? - Yes What is this informer's name? I'm not allowed to reveal it Medical confidentiality... Yet you don't mind to fill your book with the names of famous people who solicit you Only those who said I could At 300 euros a visit I hope you give them discounts Only those who can afford it pay For the others... no availabilities I take no more than 900 a week Above that I ask them to donate to a charity G, I, M equals E, K, L What proves you're a real psychic? The fact that suckers buy into your phony visions? What proves you're a good shrink? The number of depressed people you keep dependent on you if they can pay? Your reply, Roland Buech? Let's run a test - My niece's first name? - Clairvoyance is serious, sir A private relationship between consenting adults Let's respect my privacy In this envelope is a picture that doesn't concern me What is it of? "I won't play this game" "My association "Open your Eyes" offers a million euros" "to anyone with proof of paranormal activity" "What is it a picture of?" "It doesn't work like this" She's a quack, a total quack When you corner her she wiggles her way out Mona Lisa In the envelope is de Vinci's Mona Lisa "It was rigged" "It's obvious" No, it's just negligence With the projectors I could see through the envelope See? She admits it's all hocus pocus The most expensive psychic just declared on live TV that clairvoyance doesn't exist And the most famous shrink just showed that if I'm phony I could have, thanks to him proven the contrary I love contradiction but not amateurism Good evening For those who want to meet her in greater depth Chloe Delmart will be signing books tomorrow at one pm at the Tropismes bookshop "Roland Buech, a final word?" Critical thinking always triumphs over quackery You cut him down to size that scumbag Roland Buech! Keep it up! Light must conquer the forces of darkness - Thank you - I brought you some info about our Church of Universal Consciousness With an inscription form We're counting on you I will see it It's for... - Your name? - Hello I need to talk about... - Your name? - Zac As in "Muzak?" - No, as in Zacharie - The prophet? The rugby player Zacharie Stern saved my grandma during the war A family hero. I'm nothing I believe in nothing - But yesterday... - Have a nice day Yesterday, I took your order at the station and I didn't take just your order Meaning? I did an MRI this morning I'm fine Since I met you, I hear It's not my doing I'm no miracle worker, goodbye As a child, you had a lifeguard named Georges Yes, it's in my book. So what? Fluid attraction does not prevent... I don't know, he's talking too fast! Damien! A certain Damien almost made love yesterday in a parking lot with... With who? Harissa I'm not sure, with that accent For Marc from Les Sabots d'Helene your greatest admirer I'm sorry Mrs. Lombard? I have an emergency, I have to go Get their names and bring me the books - I will sign them tomorrow - Yes, but... Come with me I'm thrilled you came I was distraught I had no way of finding you - You okay? - Me? Yes... no - What's happening to me? - It's nothing - It will be fine - It's pure hell How can you bear it? Careful! Don't provoke the information I'm not doing anything It comes without asking my opinion It's unbearable - Speak to anyone? - Everyone! I can't stop It has totally destroyed my life Get it out of me! I will. Let's go to my place Take it easy Sir? - So clairvoyance is contagious? - Not exactly I have no personal vision about my future or interests - Is that normal? - Yes - Will I find another job? - No idea - Concentrate and you will see - See what? I see nothing since yesterday You took my visions Shit...I thought it was like catching a flu No, it's not like catching a flu It's an entity that left me for you - A what? - A spirit A spirit? A dead person? In my head? - He's not dangerous - Take him back That's all I want Where did I put that damn ticket? Is your car a gray BMW convertible? - No - Great, I'm wrong! That means the dead guy is leaving Blue Mine is blue but I ordered a gray one Shit - Three floors down? - If you say so Try to disconnect, Zep - Zac - Sorry. "Zac" Don't ask too much of the spirit - It wears it out? - It takes root Who is the spirit? Someone enlightened, I promise I don't believe in the devil the afterlife or ghosts - You're right - Bullshit! Yes, the more you resist the less he will take root Is it coming or not? Relax, or we will take the stairs It's not my fault it's broken! But yes, your conflicting energy perturbs electronic circuits What happened? You got in a fight with your spirit? No, well yes It's more complicated Say you're sorry and he will go back That's not how he works - He's a very high-level spirit - I'm flattered Albert! He said "I'm Albert" as if we knew each other Excuse me You know him! I have never known an Albert in my life You know his last name Einstein You're being squatted by Albert Einstein Coming? Walk normally. He won't fall off I caught Albert Einstein's ghost! You have to relativize It's his spirit, that's all The receptacle of his thoughts He never makes paranormal appearances He's very decent Besides, if you don't believe you risk nothing You're funny He keeps talking I have to believe, or else I'm crazy - Don't be too logical - Why? He likes that But why me? I'm lousy at math Why not pick a scientist? Not his thing. They betrayed him - But why the hell choose me? - Maybe he didn't choose you He was sick of me You were just there Do I look like a hotel? Why not go in him? He's bald, he looks smart! Or her! It will be fun. Lots of action! Enough! Fuck Einstein! The atom bomb was him! You're confusing him with Oppenheimer Albert wrote formulas He didn't make the bomb Who says it's the real one? - Real? - The real Einstein There may be imposters among the dead He told me the beginning of quantum theory - justifying particle entanglement - What for? To reconcile gravitation and electromagnetism Great, that means less unemployment I showed specialists It's a viable path in his work Albert, tell me where I parked I can't stand it anymore "Can we take the roof down?" "I'm claustrophobic" It's over between Damien and Harissa - I said to disconnect - I'm trying - but it's throbbing inside - I know G, I, M, equals E, K, L No, ma'am, not before April I don't have her agenda yet Call back in a month So? Did Albert finish his strike? Ask him Good morning It's confirmed for Qatar The princess is thrilled I think I will join you Hold the line, please Your 14:30 is in the waiting room Mrs. Le Couidec-Mertens is in there - She left the clinic? - There was a problem Commissioner Roger sent this. It's urgent Yes, hello. Hold the line The PSG coach, for his stomach - Can't he go see a doctor? - He doesn't trust them It's psychosomatic Your stomach is fine But you will have a heart attack this winter Don't listen. He roots for the OM "Nelly, no news from Chloe?" - I will call you back - She's stuck in traffic, ma'am - Albert switched channels? - Just for a bit I'm dealing with it... Don't touch that. Put it down How dare you speak like that to a client? I don't know what I'm saying It pops up and comes out Learn to filter I don't want instructions Get him out of my head! Give me just one minute What's he saying about this boy Raoul? - He wasn't kidnapped - Where is he? No emergency. He's fine His parents should worry rather than coddling his bitchy sisters who torture him in What's he up to? I don't even have time to listen I'm already saying it That's the way he is He's good energy, lots of humanity Nothing riles him up like injustice I don't care. No one helps me - I can't afford... - Relax... Come Lie down here Your hands Try to forget yourself, okay? Empty your head Think of nothing, so I can negotiate directly with Albert - Okay - Close your eyes "Chloe, did you take Grandma's boat?" "I will never forget you Albert Einstein" 1'13". Bravo! He said watch out for your legs - Who? - Albert There's a car accident What do you mean my daughter's a medium? It's common with high-level swimmers Relaxing their minds during training opens them to other levels of consciousness I don't understand A spirit is taking advantage of her mental availability to send her messages Me! Me! Not all at once. Pierre? You said I would retire to Florida But who will be president? - A black man - Chloe! Don't talk nonsense Concentrate and let Pappy Albert answer Linda? Chloe, will I ever sing at the Nice opera? - Yes - You see? I told you so Where will I go on vacation this summer? - Morocco - That's true! I just reserved! - With Dad - What? Fuck He will say he's working in Strasbourg but he will be at her hotel in Morocco - "Bastard!" - "Let me explain!" "There's nothing to explain Goddamn bastard!" - Leave my house! - Yes right Your house, your friend your daughter 15 years I have put up with your shit! I'm happy with Linda Beats being your thing! - Beat it! - I'm going! I'm divorcing You can fuck up Chloe with this spirit stuff I'm fed up, you hear? I'm fed up The conclusion is absurd It's full of mistakes It's the logical follow-up to Einstein! The missing link The fusion between gravitation and quantum mechanics In string theory, what's missing is the link to space-time I found it... and it works So? Why does the link justify faulty demonstrations? Really You're not made for physics Einstein neither His teachers told him so That's how you get a Nobel prize Bitch! - Are you crazy? - Let's beat it Albert told me to live in Brussels Why? To follow in his footsteps - He said to stop physics - He has other plans for you Brussels is also NATO headquarters European Parliament He wants you to save the world How will I live? Open a psychic stand? Swim champ is riskier - I don't want to leave you alone - I'm exportable Albert, I'm sorry It's true, I tried to do too much I got conned. I went astray But... I will change everything if you come back, I promise Answer me Well, well, I prefer my life to yours So? Did you take him back? Fuck space-time! Beat it! Go home! Stop driving me crazy with your crap! Stop screaming He's hypersensitive Exactly! Get lost, asshole Get angry and leave! I find you grotesque Not to mention the A-bomb Too easy to say you invented it so it wouldn't be used Loser! Hypocrite! Murderer! Chloe, finally! You were right again Someone stole my necklace Really? I will see you shortly Don't I get priority? I told you, he holds grudges Whenever he's angry with you you will get a migraine Don't speak in the future Calm down Fighting it serves no purpose He will use your energy against him - What does he want? - To be useful Drive science forward, stop wars Like when he was alive - And now... it's your mission - Are you crazy? I'm just a beekeeper like my father was My hives are dying I wait tables so I don't get evicted Because of you, I got fired I need to find work I have no time to be squatted by Einstein You have no choice You must continue his work Why continue work that I will never understand? It's not about understanding It's about transmitting Transmitting, okay I will transmit - Zac! Stay here - "I will transmit all right!" A beekeeper You did it on purpose She must be re-operated The doctor left pliers Pliers? Impossible! I will be right back Chloe! She has a trainee? A psychic can look where he's heading Excuse me, it's an emergency Hello, my son. Would you like to say the act of contrition? No thanks - I have a problem - Speak Did you commit a sin? A guy named Albert came inside me - Was it consensual? - Not at all You mean you were raped? I didn't feel it and he won't leave - Won't leave? - It's not rape. He's squatting Possession, as your people say We no longer say that, my son The Church has evolved - Well, I want an exorcism - An exorcism? Isn't it a ritual in your religion? Get him out of me! I am not a psychoanalyst, my son Go in peace Okay You have a sister named Annick She passed away last year She sends her love May I? So what's the program now? A mosque? A synagogue? An asylum? I can't live with him inside me I can't live without him I have people hanging onto my every word They're totally dependent and some are in utter distress I can't let them down So what do you want to do? Subcontract? No! They trust only me But without you, I'm helpless I don't trust anyone My father was a doctor He cured cancer with bee stings Now we know their venom kills cancer cells But back then... His colleagues filed a complaint None of his patients came to testify in his defense It killed him I won't end up like him Here's what I suggest So who stole my necklace? "No one" Her husband took it and fenced it Don't accuse the staff I'm glad. They're so nice So who did it? Someone not affiliated with the clinic "And now he's putting their apartment in the name of his lover" "to pay off his gambling debts This guy is such a scumbag!" I'm being told you must beware of a financial problem - concerning your apartment - Yes, that's settled My husband put it in a Bahamian company for tax reasons Will I find my necklace? I will buy it back at any price I don't want to tell Sebastien It was his anniversary present Where is it? Do you see it? - The necklace? - Yes Where is the necklace? Be right back - What's wrong? - It's awful Her husband will leave her next year He has totally ruined her He sold her tire company to the Chinese She has lost everything She will be homeless She will sleep in a cardboard box Wait, Zac Everything is relative You're not necessarily seeing the future They're symbolic images Symbolic? He cheats on her ruins her and laughs You can't let that happen Tell her he stole it Zac, a session is 20 percent clairvoyance and 80 percent psychology She loves her husband She idealizes him She lives for him We can't just attack the center of her life The center can't hold! Calm down! Mediums who don't build up an armor end up with nervous breakdowns after 8 days Give me the info and I will deal with it It's her problem, not yours Come on The necklace will never be found Poor Sebastien. It will destroy him What should I do to make him feel better? I will get him a new car He loves Italian ones Tell me, Maserati or Ferrari? I think you should start cutting down expenses Why? I don't have any children Who else should I spoil? You know, Chloe, in his eyes I'm not just a tire I'm a woman - Enough - Zac! There's a new owner Deal with me now Here's what to do ask for a divorce turn him in and negotiate your taxes - Zac! - My ex-wife took everything and I must pay her taxes Like your husband, she fucked every guy she bumped into And remove the pliers! It's infected. It's disgusting! "Sebastien Le Couidec I will pick up my wife in an hour" I have a dentist appointment - Zac! - "Sebastian!" Nice way to help her become aware. Bravo! I'm just a beginner Sebastian! Your nose, your beautiful nose I'm sorry. Excuse me - Okay - It never happened to you? At first, yes Then you get used to it - You get over the indignation - I never will With me, Albert will stir up shit each time - I will never change - Neither will he - Where are we going? - To the country To a client? Only one person can end this nightmare God! And you haven't seen him in action Try to reason with Albert, please We're going to take a walk It's in this chateau that Albert, in 1932 had a short but torrid affair with the violinist Hilda Beulemans I don't care! Send him back to Chloe It's you who put Albert in her head when she was 12 No, I noticed it, I confirmed it and I comforted her, that's all Gifted children always need imaginary friends to compensate for the prevailing stupidity The squatter in my head is not imaginary Why did he tap into her? He didn't tell you? Ask him what happened on the boat to the States in 1933 Come in The whole crossing I have wanted to make love to you But I don't have it in me to cheat on my wife again You do The Nazis chased me from my homeland I had to leave my children I'm a terrible father A scatter brained love A scientist who doesn't know where he's going You will be my last ray of sunshine, Juliette A memory of what could have happened Thank you, but the porter is on his way G, I, M... - Excuse me? - equals... E, K... L... G! Thank you! Thank you! - You still hear him? - Yes What exactly is he telling you? That you should mind your beeswax I fucking don't believe it "Call the President of Risk Prevention" "He says it's urgent" "What about the Qatari princess tomorrow?" It will be fine, Nelly It's just a matter of hours Is Albert going to spend forever in this loser's head? We must find out if he intentionally left Chloe or if she ejected him unconsciously Out of saturation exhaustion, heartbreak the desire for a normal life A life without knowing anything about anyone He's not answering Georges, she says only you can help me remove Albert - What must I do? - Commit suicide And besides that? Maybe you have attracted Albert... - Do you find me attractive? - I don't know Maybe you have an goal a potential, a dream All I am is scared I don't want this power As a Jew, he should react to the Dibbuk prayer - Meaning? - Repeat... What's that? He doesn't like it at all! The prayer to chase away the demon within Don't call him a demon He's sensitive You're reacting psychosomatically There's nothing gentler? There's the Buddhist method emptying your mind But you're so full of stress... Let's go back. It's chilly Otherwise, there's the old classic A Christian prayer that often works because it doesn't rely on a power struggle What is it? "Lord, I am not worthy to receive thee" "but say only one word and I will be healed" "Lord, I am not worthy to receive thee" - What did he say? - I'm doing my exercises - Will it take long? - He entered me though my ego so I'm making it disappear Stop talking to me I have to make a stop - A client? - I will be fast - Without me - It doesn't concern you You're optimistic You can't see without me - It's you I can't bear seeing - So good luck "Say only one word and I will be healed" "I am not worthy to receive thee..." I came as fast as I could Any problems? Usually you predict them Hits news stands tomorrow - Fuck - I will say You didn't know? Didn't sense it? - I didn't leak this - You didn't predict it either General Beck I should have figured I agree - What will we do? - You? Nothing If you're asked if you have been to NATO, don't answer I will spread the rumor you're my mistress At least it's credible What are we doing here? Chloe? Chloe? Did he leave? Okay "Lord, I am not..." Excuse me? You didn't see a tall... "Lord, I am not worthy to receive thee..." That's all I needed He says that I am worthy We will see I don't believe it Zac Zac! Zac! I don't believe it! Shit! I don't believe it Albert, don't tell me he left - Yes - "Chloe, I went to the ER" for Sebastien's nose I had them do a foot x-ray Your trainee was right He's wonderful I want to see him at 5 pm before my board meeting I'm coming, stop! Back up Lose a pair of surgical pliers? - Why? - Because we found it! I went out for a walk You thought I had left you? No, that's not my style Here I am You're pretty when you're sad I mean, you look human How was your meeting? - What do we do now? - I don't know I'm two hours late I'm fed up, Zac I'm sick of pretending I think the whisky was a good idea Why are you whispering? When he was alive he couldn't stand alcohol First personal thing he has told me Now maybe we can invert the power dynamic Zac, he's making fun of you I don't think so. I got him dead drunk. Only way to neutral If I keep inviting him to happy hour at my open bar he will go back to you Can you take the top down? I feel a little... He's a real asshole Let me tell you the truth Your great-grandmother lied to you She got knocked up by a porter not a Nobel laureate I know He told me when I was 18 And you kept him in yourself Who cares about biological links? Neither my mother nor my grandmother heard his voice All they cared about was the inheritance they missed out on But my Albert... I loved him straight off And he dumped you just like that I don't understand I have changed But his not wanting me doesn't mean I should deprive others What's wrong? I will help you with your clients, all right? Gently. I understand now "We are still live in front of the house" "of the medium Chloe Delmart" Shit! - They already know - Know what? You don't say We can go to my place but it's no palace I'm sorry. I called 3 times She cut off her cell How do I leave? By helicopter? I have a contract with NATO the trucks and jeeps are my tires! If they see me leaving here They will think she got me the contract There will be an investigation I have a board meeting in an hour What do I do? Sorry, excuse me Excuse me - How do you feel? - Recyclable If I knew I was hosting a famed psychic and a Nobel laureate I would have mowed the lawn Watch out for the bees! Your father treated patients here? - It's working again? - What is? You had a flash You got Albert back How did you know he was a doctor? You told me and he's chuckling Chloe - You're not afraid? - No, why? They only sting if they're attacked I spent my childhood taming fish What's the connection? Every Christmas I asked for a hive and they gave me a fish - I was afraid of humans - Like us - Albert says us now? - That was me "The beautiful life" "Without love, no worries no problems" "Yes, the beautiful life" - Your wives are pretty - Yes We get dumped from father to son - You're leaving? - I'm being evicted. I'm negotiating Not easy to find a place that accepts 12 hives At this rate they will soon be empty I don't know what will become of me either I don't have much. Coke foie gras and 4 kinds of honey That will do fine I can't light a fire because there's a swarm in the chimney That way you can warm me up yourself I'm not necessarily that kind of guy I don't know I have no idea who you are I don't know if I can trust you But it's great not to know a thing about someone and to discover everything on your own - It terrifies me - Don't let it What does Albert say about me? Nothing He's keeping it a surprise Sorry to ask, but do you find me attractive? No - I like that about you - Okay - Are you going to feed me before? - Before? Or will you make love to me first? It depends if you're hungry Given the menu, it's not a priority I think that he's the one who wants you Are you jealous? If Albert hadn't come between us you would never have noticed Maybe that's why Albert did this May I? Very original honey It's the best Urban honey is the least polluted - Really? - What do country bees forage? Pesticides, weed killers GMOS producing their own insecticides, the worst of all There's a modified gene in canola which migrated via bacteria into the intestines of bees And beekeepers steal all their harvest and feed them with industrial sugar which is not at all antibacterial As for my bees I leave them 40 percent of their honey to build up their immune systems and they're great - So why are they dying? - I don't know - It's not weed - No, beeswax I wonder what you do with the royal jelly What's up? I would like to make love to you but it wouldn't be honest - I'm very disappointed - I know What am I for you? An Albert carrier? I'm allowed to be interested by the carrier Stop lying to yourself You just want him back Rituals don't work, dialogue neither So let's try sex Not to be pessimist but I doubt you will ejaculate Albert That's not it I would like to be loved for myself Stupid, isn't it? I don't know It has never happened to me Yes, yes... - Yes - No! - I didn't say no to you - I was saying yes to you - I got it - What? The guardians are killing the foragers mistaking them for intruders They don't understand their behavior - Something attacks their brains - Impossible. We're in a city No GMOs or pesticides The bees never go more than three kilometers away It's the Wi-Fi and relay masts The waves disturb their communications systems - Are you having visions again? - No, I'm observing It's terrifying They're killing each other over a misunderstanding We have changed the codes of nature and they can't decrypt them They can't reprogram themselves How can we explain to them? With their language, they speak by moving their antennae Each position equals a piece of info. Karl defined 110 in 1950 - My friend Karl - Von Frisch? No, he's Albert's friend not yours Zac, don't let him take control Stay conscious I will build a robot bee, coat it with wax so it smells like the hive I will program its antenna movement to pass the message It's impossible Not in your brain, but here... I just have to use it We just need money I will build robots for the world and stop the disaster The robots will teach the bees to avoid GMO zones and not to forage in the morning when the farmers spray and to fly around relay masts We have no choice 80 percent of fruits and vegetables will vanish if the bees do It will destroy the food chain and we will all die of hunger Without pollination life on earth will die Zac! Goddammit! Come back "Where are you? We take off in 30 minutes" I totally forgot - Cancel - Cancel with the princess? - "Since this morning..." - Nelly, I quit You quit? - What about me? What do I do? - I will call you back "Raoul is still missing" - You okay? - Fine I know where he is Tell the police to call me and meet me at 1 pm at the Relais du Lac Yes, I just located Raoul in an attic in Aubange Get Roland Buech on your show tonight with his check for a million euros "Albert Einstein boated here in 1933" Go on. Move There's wind, can't you see? Fuck! When Marie Curie asked me "What do we do if we sink? I can't swim" I answered "Don't worry, me neither" I made my discoveries steering my little boats I didn't care about weather, storms I didn't even have life preservers Wait, this isn't a discovery You're preparing a hold up - Yes - What about deontology? - Ethics, morality? - What morality? I'm insulted by obscurantists in the name of reason What reason? Not that of rational, reasonable people prudent people who don't dream the morose, the impotent the tyrants! They're the ones who killed me Materialists with unmoving molecules who drove me crazy and who ended up exploding my belly! Everything is relative but the stupidity of the high-handed which is absolute My abdominal aortic aneurysm wasn't a disease It was anger and I was right Zac, stay in control Don't let him... That idiot shrink will pay his million euros Then I can make my robot bees and send a message to every nation to put an end to pesticides GMOs and relay masts Is all well? He's starving He has been waiting There are other ways to use Albert's power I love you, Chloe, but I had to leave you to tell you - So don't hinder my action - Your action? What action? You're transforming a great guy into a media whore! I'm revealing him not transforming him He was a resigned loser Now he's a winner full of rage Your rage, Albert, not his You chose him for his ideal and turn his failure into bitter anger and thirst for power Yes, for mankind's good It's love It's not love. It's ego You took me over young Who knows where I would be without you? But him...I can see how you're changing him You're bad You're toxic for him Albert! If you love me... leave him I'm the chance of his life If you love him leave him to me Chloe? What did you tell her now? Shall I keep her meal warm? No, no... serve them I will eat for two What are you doing? You're stopping, I'm useless now I need to find a job - You're my friend - Really? What's my life when I'm not taking your calls? Where do I live? What do I do? You're with your graphic designer, right? Jean... Jean-Marc Jean-Pierre We have a 3-year-old girl that I raise alone It's normal you don't remember her You only saw her in a vision I invited you tons of times You never have time I left college to follow you to Brussels But besides money what have you given? - Was I really that awful? - No, you were busy Welcome to the real life of real people Watch out for him He's vicious I bet his million-euro check doesn't even exist Sure it does Why am I here, otherwise? You're the one who knows I hear you're really talented too Two days ago, I made up Chloe Delmart She told me that Saturday I would meet "the one" - Christophe - No, Cedric What do you think? Who cares? Who's Christophe? My son Tell him to chose the imaginary time variable R minus 1 CT, rather than the real time variable But he's 9 and a half One day he will prove that clairvoyance is just a virtual program to correct the future in the 11 dimensions of space-time if he can open the 12th which allows the synthesis of the circulation of information among the past, present and future G I M equals E K L G - We need our guest on the set! - Coming! An attack that terrorists are planning can be seized and canceled according to the principle of retro causality If an unwanted effect precedes cause, we remove the cause Give him this. It will blow him away but it will be great I'm so happy! Thank you! "On the air in 2 minutes" Zac! Zac! Go for it! - Good evening - Good evening - You know the guest? - Sure I do. He's incredible He told me to see my mom and saved her life I went, I rang, she answered and had a heart attack - I managed to save her - How wonderful Will he open a psychic office? I'm pushing him to keep it quiet but the spirit talking to him is Albert Einstein I know I worked for his former channel - What a coincidence - There are no coincidences But Zac needs a coach For sure Shall we coach him together? "Truth be Known, good evening" "Our first guest tonight" "an unknown so-called medium" "who helped locate the missing child Raoul" "Imposter, con job or a true paranormal power?" "See for yourselves with the man who will try to meet" "Roland Buech's challenge" "Ladies and gentlemen, Zac" So... What's in this envelope? "I can't see" - Who is that person? - I can't hear Does this ring a bell? Go on, Zac! Whose brush is this? So? A blonde's With long hair "I told you he was full of shit my love" Even a dog knows who a brush belongs to But when he smells a crook my lawyers confirm it Finish your yogurt and pack your bags My love What I blame imposters like you for is making us believe the impossible and making us feel even more helpless vis-a-vis reality Don't you think I ever dreamed of chatting with a dead person You're worse than a quack You're a dream-killer "Without any delay..." So you got Albert back I'm not sure it's a good thing - Roland! An autograph - That was amazing - You destroyed him - You were great I saw the show - Are you okay? - Fine Much lighter... but a little empty So? Was Albert happy with his holiday? I don't know - He didn't go back to you? - No "Good evening, everyone..." What will it be? 26, 4, 28, 7, 11, 3 and 9 We could have saved the hives with a million euros Anyway, without Albert bees are over with Not necessarily I'm selling my apartment and my car We can save the bees Is that what you want? Are you sure? Did they ask you? No, no one will ever tell me what to do - But it will be with you - With me? Even alone? - Even if I'm... empty? - Yes I will keep the package Leave me alone! Roland! He got all the numbers! Roland! What about the next lottery? I don't see a thing! Nothing! I see nothing! "G, I, M equal... G..." By maneuvering my robots' antennae I'm telling your bees not to forage the neighbor's strawberry because they're GMOs Shit! Let me explain to them "I had in my heart" "A man who moved in" "A protector, a ghost, a soul mate" "He was better than a father" "He was my reference" "I lost Albert I'm alone on Earth..." "And hell is Albert" "I have a squatter" "An internal voice" "who thinks I'm his microphone" "For hours he has been telling me" "the hardships of people the future of the earth" "This ghost is screwing up my life" "What a joy" "I just found Albert" "My imaginary love in an ordinary man" "A miserable what's deep in his heart" "to attract my sister soul" "How will I get Albert back?" "This tenant refuses to stay silent" "has nothing simple I don't care about everything" "Except Albert" "His owner accuses him of adultery" "I have mysteriously seduced Albert" "I feel our souls..." "What is this flame" "in my woman's heart" "that lights Albert up" "For being a dear, a brother" "I hope you will become" "My new reference" "By losing Albert I'm freeing us" "But what a flame" "in my woman's heart" "that lights Albert up" "For being a dear, a brother" "I hope you will become" "my new reference" "By losing Albert I'm freeing us" "I found Albert"
