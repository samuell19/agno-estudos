For my entire adult life, I have been two steps behind you, with this camera, trying to keep up with you. Mom, do you realize that? You walk at a pace. Hard to keep up with you. I am a workhorse not a show horse. Raise your right hand and repeat after me: "I, Ronald Reagan, do solemnly swear." I, Ronald Reagan, do solemnly swear. I, George Herbert Walker Bush, do solemnly swear. I, William Jefferson Clinton, do solemnly swear. I, George Walker Bush, do solemnly swear. "I, Barack Hussein Obama..." I, Barack Hussein Obama, do solemnly swear. "That I will execute the office of President of the United States..." "I, Donald John Trump, do solemnly swear." I, Donald John Trump, do solemnly swear. "That I will faithfully execute," That I will faithfully execute, "The Office of President of the United States." The Office of President of the United States. "And will, to the best of my ability." And will, to the best of my ability. "Preserve, protect and defend." Preserve, protect and defend. "The Constitution of the United States." The Constitution of the United States. - "So help me God." - So help me God. Follow me this way. Please follow me this way. Oh, I am. I really would love to get a picture. with her daughter, actually. I hear she has a daughter. Wonderful. Wait, I want to- And you are? The State of the Union. I'm going to call the House to order. I hope that it stays in order. If it doesn't stay in order, I'll call it to order again. Anyway, just think in a positive way, then every moment takes us closer to the next election. And he's about to walk up there, Jake. We're about to see the first interaction with the Speaker, Nancy Pelosi. It's going to be interesting to watch the body language, what they say to each other. We'll listen very, very carefully. Members of Congress, the state of our union is strong. USA! USA! USA! And the only thing that can stop it are foolish wars, politics, or ridiculous partisan investigations. But we must reject the politics of revenge, resistance and retribution, and embrace the boundless potential of cooperation, compromise, and the common good. There's so much crap in his speech. He lied so much, and he fear-mongered so much. -Yes. I wish I were free to say, what I want to say about this, because this is a very dangerous man. A very dangerous man. He's hiding behind World War II, the Holocaust, children's cancer and all the rest... -Right. -...to get applause lines. And, by the way, 500 million dollars over ten years, -...for childhood cancer. - A pittance. Why don't I just give you the change out of my sofa? - Yeah. - It's nothing. It was a very strange speech. - It really was. It was disgusting. And then to stand in the well of the House of Representatives and say so many things happened... The abolition of slavery, this or that. "But don't think you're going to exercise your constitutional authority "of oversight over the Executive Branch" "in terms of the separation of power." Was that a threat? - Yes. - Absolutely. Make my day. Okay Mom, here we go. You've set-up an epic battle. The press are now saying it's you against the president. - Good morning. - How are you, George? Oh, super! Tell me when you've heard enough. I'll give you some of the top stuff, it's unbelievable. Look it says: "Dems celebrate the Pelosi era after State of the Union". - Pelosi era. - Literally. - It's the Pelosi Era. - "Clap back at Trump." That didn't take long. - He's looking. - He doesn't know what hit him. Look at him. The McDonald's Summit. - Photoshopping gone mad. - What has he got on? Oh, my God. - Everywhere. Yes. - That was terrible. I'm going to rearrange your pictures so that I get more prominent display in this household. Look at that, it's me and my mommy. It looks like it's fading a little bit. Okay, I want you to come sit down and tell me your life story. - Is this okay? - I want to put you in these... Look, I put the picture of me and you there. So that all my siblings can see I'm your favorite. See? Look. See how long my hair is? That was a hippie era, long hair, purple jeans. Mom, why did you choose this life? I didn't really choose this life. It chose me. I was born into politics. That was the life that we led. I was born into a family that was devoutly Catholic, proud of our Italian-American heritage, fiercely patriotic, and staunchly Democratic. When I was born, my father was in Congress. He was a "New Deal" Democrat who worshiped at the shrine of Franklin Roosevelt. Then, when I was seven, he became mayor of Baltimore. And then, from first grade to college, he was mayor. So that was the only life I really ever knew. Every day was a campaign. There was never an election that we weren't involved in. I learned from my father that it was important to know how to count. You had to know how many votes it takes to win. My fellow citizens... Eight years after my father was mayor, my brother Tommy became mayor of Baltimore. He taught me how to own the ground, that it was absolutely essential to turn out the vote in order to win the election. What was Grandmom's role in all this? My mom ministered to the needs of the poor and she considered public service a very high calling. She wanted me to be a nun... But that didn't work out for her. So then you met dad in college, got married, had five kids in six years, then what? Then I was a mom for a very long time. But I did have some good organizational skills. Years later, one of my friends said: "I expected she was going someplace" when I saw her having those little children fold and stack their own laundry, right out of the dryer. - So when did you go into politics? - Well, I was a volunteer in politics. Then I became the chair of the California Democratic Party. My hope is that this convention will unite our party and will lead us to a better world. And after that I was asked to run for Congress. According to the official returns of the special election, The Honorable Nancy Pelosi was elected to the office of United States Representative, in Congress from the 5th District of California. My father came to the floor when I won. Do you solemnly swear that you will support and defend the Constitution of the United States? He passed away about two months later. So I was really very lucky. ...you are about to enter, so help you God? I do. You are a member of the House of Representatives. There had been many sons who had followed their fathers into Congress. But here I was, the first daughter of a member of Congress to serve. I was born when he was in Congress. He made us all very proud in our family, and he also taught us a tradition of public service, a tradition of commitment to making government work for people. And now we must take the leadership, of course, in the crisis of AIDS, and I look forward to working with you on that. Nancy Pelosi, come on! Nancy Pelosi, come on! Nancy Pelosi, come on! I never asked anybody to vote for me because I was a woman. But I certainly did not want anybody to vote against me because I was a woman. I think it's a plus for the Democratic Party. But if I didn't have the credentials, I wouldn't be having a majority of the votes right now. The Chair announces that Hi, Mr. President. It was pretty big. It was 23 votes, which is a big, big margin, yeah. Yeah, in our house that's a big margin. Thank you, bye-bye. Did I do- Was that good, Mama? If you're feeling good out there, Let me hear you clap your hands! Clap. It's hot in here. Tell them, Nancy Pelosi, Nancy Pelosi My colleagues just bestowed upon me ...the great honor to be the leader of the Democrats in the House of Representatives. Wasn't it great? Yes. Congratulations, Mom. I'm very proud of you. Put your hands up! Hands, up! We can do it! Working together, we will win the House of Representatives and elect the first woman Speaker of the House. If you're feeling good out there Let me hear you clap! And she will soon make history as the first female Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi! It's crazy. It's now my privilege to present the gavel to the first woman speaker in our history, the gentlelady from California, Nancy Pelosi. Nancy Pelosi will be the highest-ranking woman to ever hold political office, two heartbeats away from the president. This is an historic moment for the Congress. It's an historic moment for the women of America. It is a moment for which we have waited over 200 years. Let's hear it for the children. We're here for the children. For these children, our children and for all of America's children, the House will come to order. MRS. PRESIDENT CHAMBER OF REPRESENTATIVES And tonight, I have the high privilege and distinct honor of my own as the first president to begin the State of the Union message with these words: "Madam Speaker." In his day, the late Congressman, Thomas D'Alesandro Jr. from Baltimore, Maryland, saw Presidents Roosevelt and Truman at this rostrum. But nothing could compare with the sight of his only daughter, Nancy, presiding tonight as Speaker of the House of Representatives. All right, let's do a little chant. - What do we want? - Impeachment! - When do we want it? - Now! - What do we want? - Impeachment! - When do we want it? - Now! - What do we want? - Impeachment! How am I supposed to explain this to my son? Why are there all these war protesters living outside of our house? When I became Speaker, there was a momentum in the country to impeach President Bush for initiating the war. And we're sleeping... To me, the Iraq war was one of biggest mistakes in our country's history. I voted against the war, spoke out against the war, and yet these people were outside my house, protesting the war. It's the press. Hello. Hi, Sean. I'm in a die-in over at Pelosi's house. Does it bother you that you guys are outside of an empty house, right now, where Nancy isn't even here? Well last night we met her husband. - Where? - He came out of the house. - Would you care to join us? No, thank you. Impeach! Impeach! I said if they wanted to register their opposition to the war, they should do so at the polls, but I was not going to impeach the President. Impeach! I'm going to vomit! Who gave you the right to take the Constitution and shove it down the toilet? Who gave you the right to take impeachment off the table? - So great. - Thank you, bud. - This is my daughter, Alexandra. - Alexandra, yes. How are you? How do you feel about having a camera shoved in your face? Well, you know what? When I'm with the Speaker of the House, I would have a truck shoved in my face. It doesn't matter. I'm with the Speaker. Thank you for being here tonight. - We want to change. - We're going to make it happen. Remember how I told you I was making a movie? I'm putting you in it now. Glad to be contributing to this great work of art. This election has never been about me. It's about you! Now is the time to finally keep the promise of affordable, accessible healthcare for every single American. So we finally have a Democratic president and a Democratic Congress, and now you're going to try and pass healthcare? Yes. For nearly 100 years, there had been an attempt to pass affordable, quality healthcare. Barack Obama becomes president, we had a Democratic Congress, House, and Senate, an opportunity of a generation. We were not going to fail. Thousands of demonstrators and congressional Republicans rallied at the Capitol to voice their unhappiness with the Democrats' healthcare reform package. This bill is the greatest threat to freedom that I have seen in the 19 years I've been here in Washington. Kill the bill! The Speaker was very masterful about rounding up members who had difficulties, with the Affordable Care Act. for whatever reason. She had to persuade those members, kind of one by one... ...that they had to go on to the bill. You do not take it to the floor for debate until you have the votes locked up. There are no passes, especially on something as central to who we are as Democrats. No, but, I mean, this is it. This is the defining moment for the Democrats. This is why we elect Democrats. This is why we are here. And you can't just be on the taking end of it. That's just the definition of saying, "I'm not on this team." There has to be some giving, especially on a vote like this. I don't want to take up any more of your time, okay? Thank you. Bye-bye. He said, "I hope you don't think I'm just a taker." You vote "no" and then you expect to get something? I was really critical. You know, I start with a feather and I'm nice, nice nice. And then that sledgehammer comes out. I can't even talk with him anymore again, because I'm trying to pass a bill here. Vote no. Vote no. Vote no. Vote no. Let them hear us! See the lights up there? That's where we need to be yelling. Kill the bill! Did you hear that? The guy said, "We will remember in November." Nancy Pelosi last night said that they were answering the call of history, right? I gotta tell you, if the Democrats keep ignoring the American people their party's gonna be history in about a year. It is time to pass healthcare reform for America. And I am confident that you are going to do it tomorrow! Thank you very much, House of Representatives. Let's get this done! Is there any sense of trepidation from people from people who are thinking about voting for this? I think some of them are just committing political suicide and they know it. 186, 18, and 8. Are you leaving somebody out of 8? Okay, so what is this? What does this add up to? - 186 and 18 is 214. - Okay, 186. What is it 204 and 7, 211? The lists are a way to sort of do a whip tally of our caucus, make sure that we've got every member exactly where we want to be. She wants to see, real time, where we are. And she's always adding up the numbers. Boucher, Bright, Chandler, Childress, Costello. We have to try it again. I'll invite him to this other meeting. Davis, Davis. 14, 15... Some people count sheep at night. I count votes. It's really close. I mean, it really is close. Members are coming back saying, "I can't do it. I can't do it." And finally she just says: "Give me the names and leave me alone." And only in that circumstance would I call you to see if you could influence Mr. Donnelly to support the bill. We were probably at 190 votes 48 hours ago. Right now, we need 216 votes to win in the House. That's the majority. The Speaker's probably talked to every single person on this list, except her closest friends, who she knows are gonna be with us. Thank you, Father. I'd love to come get your blessing. You have been a leader, an inspiration. The Speaker has amazing power of persuasion. She's a heat-seeking missile on votes. She appeals to their moral fiber. He said to me, "I'm going to ruin my career here." I said: "This is not a place for people without options. If the idea was to come because you can't be any other place, we don't want you here." I would walk out of the Speaker's office on Sunday night and never come back, thrilled forever that we have 32 million people. They think their being here is more important than that. You want my job? - These two make it 211. - Right. Plus these two make it 213. 4, 5... We need 216 votes to win in the House. That's the majority. So right now we have 217. We're across the finish line. We've got one undecided left, just one. 218. But I thought we were 219. But every member that casts a vote on a one-vote margin could be accused of being the person that put it over the line. So you really tactically wanna have two or three or four or five votes. Kill the bill! Speaker Pelosi leading House Democrats up the steps of the Capitol. The Speaker carrying the gavel that the House used when it voted to create Medicare. After we pass this bill, being a woman will no longer be a pre-existing medical condition. On this vote, the "yeas" are 219, the "nays" are 212. The bill is passed! History on the Hill. Democrats finally accomplished what they had been promising for decades. healthcare for all Americans. Well, I was pretty happy last night, but I'm not sure I was happier than when you got elected president. 'Cause Thank you, Mr. President. Bye. I'm sorry you didn't... So what does the president have to say for himself? He said he was happier than he was the night he got elected. ♪"KODACHROME" BY PAUL SIMON PLAYING♪ I got a Nikon camera I love to take a photograph... - Pick me, me. - What's that? Don't take my Kodachrome away Mama, don't take my Kodachrome away Mimi, up. All righty. Mama, don't take my Kodachrome Mama, don't take my Kodachrome Mama, don't take my Kodachrome away. Mama, don't take my Kodachrome... Come on, Paulie. Show me the wave. Yay! Show me the wave. - Let's do this. Mama, don't take my Kodachrome There we go. To Democrats, this historic legislation is their generation's biggest accomplishment. To Republicans, it's the beginning from a government takeover of our healthcare system. The American people are very angry and they don't like it. And we're going to try to repeal this. And we are going to have a very spirited campaign coming up between now and November. And there will be a very heavy price to pay for it. - Are we going to fire Pelosi? - Yes! Are you going to take back your government? Yeah! So would you rather pass healthcare or be Speaker? Oh my goodness, there's absolutely no comparison. The fact is we're there to do a job, not to keep a job. I am so proud of what we did in healthcare. And if I have to go have another line of work, because I voted to give the American people security in their healthcare in their country, so be it. I'm proud to do it. CNN can now project that Republicans will have a net gain of 39 seats. They will become the majority in the House of Representatives. John Boehner will become the next Speaker of the House of Representatives. Nancy Pelosi will not be the Speaker. Nine out of ten voters in our exit poll told us they are worried about the economy. Hello Mr. President. Not a good night. Unemployment is over 9%... Our members have said they don't regret their healthcare bill right across the board. Even if we never passed healthcare reform, we were still going to lose this election because of 9.5% unemployment. 'Cause it wasn't about that. It was about jobs. The White male thing is just... That's a dominant thing. When they don't have a job, they get in a mood. And, um... So, we'll have to make some decisions in our caucus about how we go forward. So, did you ever intend to stay this long? When Trump was elected, I knew I had to stay to protect the Affordable Care Act. Tonight I am also calling on this Congress to repeal and replace "Obamacare". To save Americans from this imploding "Obamacare" disaster. When we first were passing the Affordable Care Act, I said: "We view this as an opportunity. and a responsibility of a generation, there with Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid." And we are not gonna let anything stand in the way of our passing this legislation. We pushed open the gate. We're not letting them push that gate back. So, you went on the road to defend the Affordable Care Act? Oh, yeah. When it was clear that the Republicans were out to repeal the Affordable Care Act, plans were placed into motion for 10,000 events across the country, where people told their stories. An estimated six thousand 6,000 people showed up in Boston yesterday. Six thousand people in support of the Affordable Care Act. People got up on stages throughout the country sharing their story about the Affordable Care Act, how it's literally saved their lives. Healthcare is a human right! Thank you for not agonizing, but organizing. Kill the bill! Kill the bill! Kill the bill! All of you are making a difference. I'm feeling very optimistic. The difference is made by the outside mobilization. You are making that difference. On behalf of the House Democrats, I come to thank you for that. Arizona Senator, John McCain, this is his first trip back to Washington since being diagnosed with brain cancer. Isn't it ironic? The guy who fought the hardest against the Affordable Care Act... Hey, guys. How are you? Good to see you. ... is now going to cast the deciding vote on your signature legislation? Well, it isn't ironic as much as it is showing how far the Republicans were willing to go to undermine the health security of our country. Senator? Your courage, which is endless, your coming back to being an adult in the room in addition to being a hero, is really very valuable, and I'm enormously grateful for that. No. Thank you, Senator. You're wonderful. Thank you, thank you for everything, again and again. - Mr. Manchin. - No. - Mr. Markey - No. Mr. McCain. The Republican effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act has failed. Arizona Senator, John McCain helped sink the effort, along with Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski. Hello? Hey. Mr. Speaker, thank you for calling back. I called for two reasons. One was to say, hopefully, we can have regular order and work together to make the improvements and updating of the Affordable Care Act. And then we can listen to, you know, all the ideas in the world now that we have not scared people to death with a repeal. Thank you. Have a good break. Thank you, bye-bye. So this is what you do all day? You call people. Well, it's not all that I do all day, but it's part of what I do. And that's why when people look at my schedule and say, "You have free time." I say, "I don't have free time. I have a day job and I have to make things happen." So I can't make it happen if I'm in a meeting every You know. I can make that happen, but I have other things that are going on. So it's a working farm. There are all kinds of things going on here all the time. Really? It is glorious. And for me, it was the reason I stayed. It was just to protect the Affordable Care Act, because it means so much. So how do you feel, Chuck? You feel good? You're a nut. Goodbye. (Speaking Italian) Look at the honeymooners. No, I'm enjoying the honeymooners. Hold on. This is nice. The honeymooners. Aw. The honeymooners. Woohoo! Okay, let me get a sip. Let me get a sip. Go ahead. Thomas, you have a sip, too. Just taste it. - Okay. - First sip of champagne. - She's coming. - Take a... It's okay. Just take a sip. I heard a pop. Oh, come on. I don't want these boys drinking alcohol. He's just tasting it, Mimi. This is one of my most favorite places in the world. The miracle of carving this marble... Out of one piece. ...so that it looks like it's all folded like cloth. Look at that... It's an honor to meet you. So- Oh, thank you, your holiness, so much. Yes. Thank you. One hundred days now to the midterm elections. Republicans have the majority right now, 235 seats. The Democrats are at 193. This is the most important election of our time. We have made a decision to win. Onward to a great Democratic victory. The Democrats sweep these toss-ups, that would give them 230 seats, more than enough to be in the majority. So you've been doing battle with Trump for two years now, and this is your moment to rein him in. What's your game plan? The game plan is to own the ground. That means you must be able to get out every possible vote. It's about owning the ground on election day. Knocking on doors, walking those precincts, making those calls for the American people. Lower healthcare cost, bigger paychecks, cleaner government for people to trust again. We don't agonize, we organize. Are you ready for that? Are you ready for that? - Yeah! I think you can do a little better. - Yeah! On our talking points we have the economic message, and that is what it has to be. Look, I got the rainbow on my arm. I got the this for the that. All these things are in our DNA, but they're not in our talking points. It's all about the economy. So people ask, "Is it going to be a wave or is it going to be a tsunami?" And I said, "In any case, it's a series of drops, small drops of water." How many drops of water we have will determine if it's a wave or a tsunami. But all these races are going to be very, very close. Think of the Olympics. One second, gold, silver, bronze, honored to be an Olympian. I have a sixth sense about, the scent of elections. And I smell success wherever I go... You are impossible to crack. - You're always on message. - You know me. How do you do it? How do you always stay on all the time? You're impossible to crack. - You know that. - Yeah. Well, I have my sensitivities. What does that mean? That means I have to be sensitive to the impact of my words on certain other campaigns. You know, if I'm saying, "I can smell success," that means I can smell lack of success as well. You're a tough nut to crack. You know that? - There's no cracking you, huh? - Hmm. Well, if that's what you want to do, crack your mom. Yes, I do. I want to crack you. Nancy Pelosi's already looking beyond this year's midterm election to taking back the Speaker's gavel. "I will run for Speaker and I feel confident about it." With Pelosi as Speaker, everything we fought for will come undone. Mom, they're really coming after you. - Have you seen these ads? - I don't see them because they don't show them in San Francisco. But I've heard about them, that they had 137,000 ads against me. Once, Nancy Pelosi was safely confined to liberal San Francisco. The Republicans knew that I was a problem to them because I was successful. If I were not successful, I would not have been their target. And by the way, when you 're a woman you're more of a target. Vote November 2nd, the day we fight back. Mom, she's gonna win. She's gonna win, 90 percent. Delgado won. Mimi, Mimi, Mimi. Mimi, CNN, they predict... CNN can now project that Democrats will win the majority in the US House of Representatives. This is a huge win for the Democrats, a huge setback for the president and for the Republicans. Last night, the Republican Party defied history to expand our Senate majority while significantly beating expectations - in the House. - What is this? - That's a big percentage of the numbers. I mean, really? - So it really could be a beautiful bipartisan type of situation. - Unless we... - Listen. Perhaps, looks like I would think, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, I give her a great deal of credit for what she's done - and what she's accomplished. - And do you expect that when the Democrats take over the chairmanship of all these important committees you're going to get hit with a blizzard of subpoenas - on everything from Russia. - So, "Let's impeach the president and then we'll impeach the vice president." These people are sick. And you know what? They have to get their bearing. Really they have to get their bearing. - And when you... - There's something wrong with this man. There's something seriously wrong. They're the ones that cause the division. - They cause tremendous division. - Okay regarding all of your Oh, my God he's saying Nancy Pelosi deserves to be Speaker of the House. And, "If they give her a hard time, perhaps we'll add some Republican votes." There are some Democrats who are saying they're not going to vote for you. Well, I've never had a unanimous vote. I've always had an opponent. So I feel pretty comfortable about it. They have this fairly elderly leadership in the House. And there's certainly a large portion of the party that would like to see some younger blood. There are some people there who probably have a legitimate concern about succession. There are others who don't. They just have been negative and almost haters. The talking heads are saying you're not going to be Speaker, you don't have the votes. The press likes to sell papers. They all found it interesting to exaggerate the opposition to my becoming Speaker. I wouldn't ask members to vote for me if I didn't know I had the votes. I have a good feel for where the votes are in my caucus. Since the election, she has met in person with 67 members or members elect. How do you get people's votes? Do you just break their knees - and make them vote for you? - No! I'm very respectful of people's views. So I want to hear what they are. I want to hear what people have to say. You count votes by listening. This is how the sausage is made, these one-on-one conversations. This is why she knows how everyone's gonna vote before the votes. Well, now we have 170 publicly committed. Some of them will not be telling the truth, and some of the others that I discounted, would be. And that would make it around there. So we'll see. Nancy has been with us. And she will be with us now, tomorrow, and in years to come. I ask of you, I beg of you, I plead with you, to go and do what we must do and cast the vote for Nancy Pelosi as the next Speaker of the House of Representatives. Votes for the election of the Democratic nominee for Speaker of the House, results are, out of 239 ballots cast, Representative Nancy Pelosi received... Nancy Pelosi has been elected as the Democratic nominee for Speaker of the House over 100... If we don't have border security we'll shut down the government Because the people of this country don't want criminals and drugs pouring into our countries. You know, Nancy's in a situation where it's not easy for her to talk right now, and I understand that. But we have to have border security. Mr. President, please don't characterize the strength that I bring to this meeting as the leader of the House Democrats who just won a big victory. At that now famous Oval Office meeting... ...there was a lot of shade thrown. But when Nancy Pelosi put on shades for exactly five seconds. that became the moment her fans immortalized. "The new power suit for women. Red coat. Sunglasses." Nerves of steel. I mean, look at the two of them. He looks like he had a panic attack in a steam room, and she looks like Neo from The Matrix... - ...if he shopped at Talbots. Nancy Pelosi was the first woman to be elected Speaker of the House. Today she becomes just the second person to have lost that position, then be elected Speaker again. If the gentlewoman from California would please raise her right hand. Do you solemnly swear that you will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic? That you will bear truth, faith, and allegiance to the same, and that you will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office of which you're about to enter, - so help you God? - I do. Congratulations, Madam Speaker. I now call the House to order on behalf of all of America's children. ♪ I've got all the riches ♪ ♪ Baby, one man can claim ♪ ♪Well, I guess you say ♪ ♪What can make me Feel this way ♪ ♪ Our girl ♪ ♪ Our girl ♪ ♪ Talking about our girl ♪ ♪ Nancy Pelosi ♪ Liar, thief, predator in-chief. Liar, thief, predator in-chief. Is it all about taking down Trump? I know you have a little impeachment plan going... I'm celebrating my grandson's graduation tonight. I'm not talking politics. Totally okay. Thank you very much. - Thank you, bye-bye. - Appreciate your time. Oh, and if he does get impeached, - Will we see the clap again? - We could. That was epic. Have a good night, Nancy, thank you so much. - Thank you. -Take care. Every day he is obstructing justice by saying, "This one shouldn't testify. That one shouldn't test-" So he's making the case. But he's just trying to goad us into impeachment. So unless there is a case that can be made to the public in a bipartisan way, I think it would be very hard to... Well, let's just see what comes in. A mysterious whistleblower report is consuming Washington, but details are still limited. The report appears to center in part around communications between President Trump and the president of Ukraine. The Wall Street Journal reports during the call, Mr. Trump pressured the Ukrainian president to investigate former Vice President, Joe Biden's son, Hunter. - Hunter Biden was... - This crossed a line that we have to act upon. As some of your members have said, if all the other stuff never existed, this would be reason enough to go forward. The White House has just released a transcript of President Trump's July 25th phone call with Ukraine's president. You've been resisting the call to impeach President Trump. So what pushed you over the line? The president just didn't seem to know right from wrong. He thought that releasing the transcript was going to be a vindication for him, instead of an indictment... which it was. So this is the transcript. Let me read you two sentences. President Zelensky says, "We are ready to buy more Javelins from the United States for defense purposes." The very next sentence from President Trump, "I would like you to do us a favor, though." Further into the transcript he says, "The other thing, there's lots of talk about Biden's son." Trump describes how he would like the president of Ukraine to investigate his political opponent, Joe Biden's son, Hunter. Telling him who he's going to have call him to help implement that, including the attorney general of the United States. "I need a favor I need a favor." He didn't really know right from wrong. And what he had done is crossed a threshold into impeachment territory. Somebody's just sent me this picture, which has been in the public domain for a while. And it's a picture in which I am saying to the president, "With you, Mr. President, all roads lead to Putin. I'm out of here in terms of this meeting.' And the White House, uh, put— took the picture, 'cause we're not even allowed to bring cameras into such a room. The Pre- The White House put this out to show how out of hand I had become. But in fact, what they did was a giant favor to me for people seeing me stand up to the president, especially in a room of all these White men. In the darkest days of the revolution, Thomas Paine wrote, "The times have found us. The times have found us." We believe that the times have found us now. Not that we compare ourselves to the greatness of our founders. But we do identify an urgency of protecting our Constitution, which this president is not honoring his oath of office to. If we do not have a system of checks and balances, separation of power, co-equal branches of government, we have a monarchy. The actions of the Trump presidency revealed the dishonorable fact of the president's betrayal of his oath of office, betrayal of our national security, and betrayal of the integrity of our elections. Therefore, today, I'm announcing the House of Representatives is moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry. House Democrats, they're ramping up their impeachment inquiry. The House Judiciary Committee is taking the lead in holding its first hearing next Wednesday. Chairman Jerry Nadler has invited President Trump's lawyers to attend. Jerry, Let me ask you how do you intend to deal with the questions from the members? Are you going to give them a question and say, "You have five minutes, that includes the answer? Hi, Jack. It's Paul Pelosi. He's got to control that, and I'm going to strive... - The guys are there at the gate. - to vote Thursday for the... I let them get in the gate, but they went up up to the parking lot. And I had them look for the key. - The key's not on the hook. - So that he's not actually saying the articles of impeachment, - but kind of what direction. - But when you get... - I don't know what.. - But anyway, - when you get up there... - And I don't want that. - there are those - He... - Oh, the house is unlocked? - Yep. - And then I said... - What the fuck? All right. But the alarm's on, right? The point is the witnesses. You have good witnesses to say... I don't know what the fuck happened to that key, - but that's really annoying. - ...we can have the articles - considered... - Really annoying. - You can do the... - I said, but basically, here's what you say to Aaron, - what I told you. - We'll talk about, measuring the TVs and that crap, then we can open up... They only are talking about process. - That's all they can about. - Good. Good, okay. Well, thank you, guys. Really. And sorry for the wrinkle. You're dealing with jerks. That's why Ukraine was so valuable to us, because it was substantive. It wasn't just a charge, but it has a charge about something that people could understand. He has put at risk the separation of powers. It seems to me that that is the Constitutional argument that we're here for. Are we able to have oversight of the President of the United States? If we're not, then we don't have a democracy. We feel comfortable with all of the time that has gone into this. - Speaker, Speaker. - H.R. 3 Thank you very much. Thank you. Do you hate the president, Madam Speaker? - Because... - I don't hate anybody. - Representative Collins sug- - I was raised - in a Catholic house... - The reason I ask- ...you don't hate anybody, not anybody in the world. - So don't accuse me of anything. - I did not accuse you. - You did. You did. You did. - I asked a question. Representative Collins yesterday suggested that the Democrats are doing this simply because they don't like the guy. That has nothing to do with- Let me just say this. As I Catholic, I resent your using the word "hate" in a sentence that addresses me. I don't hate anyone. I was raised in a way that is a heart full of love, and always pray for the president. And I still pray for the president. I pray for the president all the time. So, don't mess with me when it comes to words like that. We have two articles, so we'll be debating the two articles. Then we vote on each article separately. So, that's the impeachment vote. Then after that, we have a vote empowering us to take it to the Senate. But I'm not doing that until I see what the- the process is in the Senate. Then I'll determine who I send. I mean, did you ever see a situation where the jury says, "I'm doing whatever the defendant wants me to do?" Really? I mean, it's sick. It's sick. He's impeached forever, no matter what they do. But if they want to vindicate him, they better come up with some rules that are appropriate. I want to have the flag, and then I want to have something that goes across, or next to, or above. "And to the republic for which it stands." "The republic, for which it stands, is what we are here to talk about, a republic. If we can-" I think the first page is good. Thank you. Thank you, thank you. And thank you, bye-bye. Bye-bye. He told me in Hebrew. (Speaking in Hebrew) What was that? "May God give you very good luck." You don't need luck. We make our own luck. There's one thing I want to ask you to do. Somewhere in here I have a birthday card for my granddaughter, Madeline. 21 years old. I think it could be in one of - that other folder. - Other folder? One of those two other folders - that I brought in. - Okay. We'll look through. I'm gonna take a few, okay? I'm gonna need them all today. I'll keep them in my pockets. I'll have them. Just take one right now and I'll keep the rest in my pocket. Okay. When our founders declared independence and established a new nation, they crafted a system of government unlike one ever seen before. A republic, starting with the sacred words, "We the people." For centuries, Americans have fought and died to defend democracy... for the people. But, very sadly now, our founders' vision of a republic is under threat from actions from the White House. That is why today, as Speaker of the House, I, solemnly and sadly, open the debate on the impeachment of the President of the United States. Careful, careful. When will you send over the impeachment, Madam? Madam, can you share a message to the outside world? Is American democracy functioning well? People behind me. Please open the door. So, that's it, Mimi. Impeachment is over. - How do you feel? - It's not over. I mean, impeachment is over. But our- the House's responsibility to protect and defend the Constitution and the separation of checks and balances is not over. So, protecting Article One will always be our mission in the courts and in the court of public opinion. You made that joke last year. Well, you know, it's nice to be consistent. Are you gonna be on your best behavior tonight? Yes, I am. Let me just go down to the ladies' room. Thank you. - Okay, good luck, Mimi. - Keep a straight face. - I will. Don't do anything I wouldn't do. He will be speaking to a room filled with House Democrats who voted to impeach him just a month and a half ago. On the other hand, the President does give this speech with the certainty that he will be acquitted tomorrow. You see the Speaker of the House just tried to shake the President's hand and he refused, or perhaps did not see her hand. As I mentioned, there's a lot of tension between the two of them. And he did not extend his to her. Before I took office, health insurance premiums had more than doubled in just five years... We will always protect patients with preexisting conditions. And we will always protect your Medicare. And we will always protect your social security. We will never let socialism destroy American healthcare. On the coronavirus outbreak in China, my administration will take all necessary steps to safeguard our citizens. And my fellow Americans, the best is yet to come. Thank you. God bless you. And God bless America. Thank you very much. -So? What were the most egregious violations? Well, every page. I mean, it's like a hundred. That was a piece of crap. It was a total pack of lies. It was a total pack of lies. And anything that wasn't a lie, we did and he took credit for it. -Right. - It's like we demanded we're not going to give you a defense bill unless we have parental leave. So he said, "And I signed a historic-" Yeah, you signed it. But you didn't have anything to do with it. And we demanded that you do it. I feel very liberated by that speech tonight. If that's how he wants to play it, then we can have no holds barred. We just have to call him a liar. What's your next step after State of the Union? We're going to the UAW to talk about workers. I don't think that was the answer they were looking for. That's the next step. That's where I'm going. The framers predicted that factional fever might dominate- I don't want anybody to hear you. The World Health Organization has declared the coronavirus a global pandemic. There are now more than 120,00 known cases in 114 countries. In the United States, the death toll is rising. Over 1,000 cases have been reported with at least 30 confirmed deaths. COVID-19 could cause an economic tsunami. The great shutdown of 2020 is underway. The country is at a standstill. Nobody can go to work. Nobody can leave the house. We're in danger of going into a great recession. What's Congress gonna do about it? Congress must act and Congress must act soon. Of course, we wanted the legislation to be bipartisan. But the Republican leadership in the Senate was really thinking more of a trickle-down kind of a bill. We want it to be more addressing the needs of state and local government, in a way that enabled our essential workers to continue to work. - Good morning, Speaker. - How are you? So, no deal that's bipartisan - at this point? - Right. I said, "Leader McConnell brought this bill to the floor knowing what the outcome would be, and knowing negotiations were ongoing." - So, who's he kidding? - How about in that meeting when I quoted His Holiness Saint Fran- Pope Francis. - Yeah. - And then Mnuchin said, "Well, you quoted the Pope. I'm going to quote the markets." ﻿- Yeah. - "I'm going to quote the markets." Look, Mnuchin and the White House want a deal. The guy who keeps screwing it up is McConnell. I can't quite figure it out. Our first attempts at bipartisanship were not successful. The election money is a big deal to our folks. They want to see us put a mandate that all the states have to have vote by mail, only now, just for the coronavirus period. I mean, nothing for postal. And they said that's coming directly from the White House. He doesn't want any postal, 'cause he doesn't want any mail. I mean, he doesn't want any vote by mail. Okay, thank you, dear. Bye-bye. See, here's what happens in negotiations. When you get toward the end, people get tired. And that's what he is. You can't get tired. You can never get tired. You can't wear yourself down to the point of, "Oh, forget about it. Just let's do it this way." They're terrible people. They're the worst. They radicalize you. They really make you some kind of a left-wing... advocate. - Hi, George, good morning. - Morning. Mnuchin said he talked to the president ten times at least yesterday. ﻿And he said that the President is onboard with the direction things are headed, and would like to have a deal, and is hopeful he 'll do it today. They will do terrible things on immigration. And I told Chuck that some of the things they're suggesting are nonstarters. They know it's a winning issue for them at this time, when people are saying, "Well, we're trying to work and she's holding up the bill because of that." But I will. Come on. That was their excuse to begin with. Okay, let me just call Meadows. This is a waste of time. What happened? ...so they didn't. But they put it in here the exact amount of money, that it could be transferred to another account. It's a technique. Hi, Mark. How are you? I'm okay. I'm okay. I have a problem here, though. We want to get this done, but I have one place I can't go. And that is to have that money that- As we review the bill, we see is kind of disguised in here, which is this 289 million dollars to transfer to other agencies. I had plenty other reasons why members don't want to do the bill. I have four black books full of their complaints, 'cause I take notes on everything. "How come big business get this and small business doesn't get? And how come this? And how come that?" And I have page, after page, after page. And I just say, I hope you would just trust me because, on balance, I think we did very well in this or that. But I cannot take a bill to the floor with this in it. This is, you know, a backdoor way for something that I said we could not cross the threshold of. So, you cleaned up the bill, they passed it in the Senate, and now you have to get it through the House. Yes. What is important about the negotiation is to try to find as much common ground, knowing that each of us is not going to have our own way at least in this legislation, we can live to fight another day. Okay. See what fires we need to put out. Okie doke. - All right, see you. - I love that sweater on you. Our nation faces an economic and health emergency of historic proportions, due to the coronavirus pandemic, the worst pandemic in over 100 years. Those in favor, say "Aye." Aye! Those opposed say "No." - No. - The ayes have it. This 2.2-trillion-dollar relief bill will now be enrolled by the Speaker of the House and sent to the President's desk today. 2.2 trillion dollars clearly wasn't enough to handle the fallout. You've reportedly told House Democrats another trillion dollars will be needed in the next round. It was clear, even as we passed the last bill, that it would not be enough. Again, a template... In your COVID legislation, what's important to you? We had to support state and local government in a way that enabled our essential workers to continue to work. Good night, Jesus. Thank you for everything. God bless everyone, especially Mom and Dad. Amen. Godsend. - Bye, sweetheart. - Bye, Mimi. - Good night, guys. - Good night. Bye, guys, I love you. Okay, this could be the moment. My members are on fire on state and local. This is who they represent. The firefighters, the police officers, the teachers, everybody that makes government run, those people are being fired as we speak. - Hi. - Well, we gave them something - to think about, huh? - Yeah. And look, let's assume we get what we want on hospitals, This idea that he'll announce it later, I think it's bullshit. Sorry bull-doody. Yeah. We've got a lot, though. I just think that we have to make sure- Hey Nancy. we did pretty well... - We did. - They need us. And if we don't give in so fast we get more. Uh, Madam Speaker? Good morning again, Mr. Vice President. Thank you very much for being with us this morning. We look forward... -Pop, she's got the Vice President now we've got to keep it down. ...on how we can all work together for the good of the American people for their lives and their livelihood. You're doing your laundry during Mike Pence's presentation? What is the point of this call? Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I join you in thanking the Vice President and his task force. This has been a useful exchange. It gives us a measure of what our challenge is, in so many ways. We'd like to see a figure of how many people are tested. We're gonna, as the expression goes, be flying blind unless we take inventory. In the intelligence community, we had a phrase we used, "Needs and leads." Our communities can tell you what our needs are. We can also give you some leads about things that work. We really need to have a racial record of how this— how people are affected in our country, so we can track how everyone in our society is affected, again, in this Holy Week. Happy Easter to you. Thank you, Madam Speaker. Thank you very much, Madam Speaker. Thank you, Mr. Vice President And we look forward to a continued dialogue between you, the administration... - Am I a bitch or what? - ...and the caucus - who will, again... - No, it was good. - Good morning. - How are you? Are you on your way to the airport? Yes, I am. Okay we got to get our statement done. Just if there's a deal while you're on the airplane. Okay, here we go again. Going to pass another trillion-dollar bill. -Speaker. - No, this is half a trillion. Oh, only half a trillion. Excuse me. Today, the House gave final congressional approval to a 484-billion-dollar package aimed at smaller employers and hospitals. "Just be you," that's the best advice anybody can ever give anybody in politics. But in your case, especially, don't go too far to the left. You have to win the Electoral College. We can win the Senate. We will win and grow our majority in the House. But we didn't get here in the majority by going to the left. And I can say that as a left-wing - San Francisco liberal. - I'm with you. I'm with you. Look, I say to the people, "Why are you trying to carve up a pie we don't even have?" Let us win, okay? Then we can debate how quickly we go to healthcare for all Americans." Okay, we all share those values. We don't need any distrust in that regard. And good evening on day one of what is the Democratic National Convention, originally set for Milwaukee, now being held on TV, virtually. Five, four... Good evening. As Speaker of the House, it is my honor to bring you the greetings of the Democrats of the House. The most diverse majority in history. - How long is that? 4:20? - 4:20. - I still made a couple pauses. - Yeah. That is the guiding purpose of House Democrats fighting for the people. Who is standing in the way? Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump. Will you commit here today to making sure that there is a peaceful transferal of power after the election? Well, we're going to have to see what happens. You know that I've been complaining very strongly about the ballots. And the ballots are a disaster. - Do you commit to making sure... - Oh, I know. - that there's a peaceful... - Now, we want to... - transferal of power? - We wanna have- Get rid of the ballots, and you'll have a very trans- We'll have a very peaceful- There won't be a transfer, frankly. There'll be a continuation. He's trying to say he's not gonna count the votes. I mean, it's just ridiculous. This guy should be in jail. I mean, he is encouraging illegal behavior in every possible way. How are you feeling, Mimi? - Come on. Game day. - I feel good. I think Joe Biden's going to be president. If that doesn't happen I told my staff at the Capitol, at the DCCC, "If Trump wins tonight, you're never going to see me again. I'm out of here." We knew because of the unprecedented early vote and the mail-in vote, that it was going to take a while. Keep the faith, guys. We're going to win this. Thank you, thank you, thank you. It's good that he came over. He looks better tonight... Uh, no matter what stunts Trump may try to play, but the Congress has important power when it comes to the election of the president and the election of Congress. So, we're ready for hard ball on that. This is a fraud on the American public. This is an embarrassment to our country. We were getting ready to win this election. Frankly, we did win this election. It's now down to 515,000 outstanding votes in Arizona. You know, we got a relatively small tranche - of votes earlier tonight... - There you go, baby. - that we might not know... - What's that, hon? - What is it? - ...until Friday. They're gonna do- We might not get the results - of all of this, Annie. - Just towels. That's just what she needed right now. Look at Georgia, 12 to 27. I'm so glad you got some election night dish towels. So you're still confident that Joe Biden's going to be president? - Of course. - What are you screaming at me for? Cause that's what I do. Yes, I'm absolutely confident - that Joe Biden - Positive. - Yes, I'm confident- - It's as plain as the mask on my face. What were you saying, Mimi? I said, yes, I am confident that Joe Biden will be president of the United States. He will be inaugurated on January 20th, 2021. Let's hope it will be effort time of peaceful transition. If you count the legal votes, I easily win. If you count the illegal votes, they can try to steal the election from us. If you count the votes that came in late, we're looking at them very strongly. - Oh, I can't stand him. - Historic numbers. He said if you count the legal votes, he won. - knowingly wrong. - They got it knowingly wrong. - He's a nut. And this is a case where they're trying to steal an election. They're trying to rig an election. There's been a lot of shenanigans, and we can't stand for that in our country. Thank you very much. He's sick. He's insane. He's totally insane. It's really a sad thing. CNN projects Joseph R. Biden, Jr. is elected the 46th President of the United States, winning the White House and denying President Trump a second term. Congress is getting ready to count the electoral votes, which will, of course, confirm Joe Biden's victory. At this hour, election results still rolling in from those Senate runoff races in Georgia. All of this, as pro-Trump protesters gather in Washington for rallies. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. When we say, "Good morning," it really is one today. 'Cause we're gonna have two new senators, no question about that. I think that this victory not only changes the dynamic in the Senate, but it changes the dynamic in our country. - Here you go. - Thank you. Oh, my God. There's so many of them. Today is a sacred day for our democracy as we mark the peaceful transfer of power. The Constitution gives us a very specific role today. We are there for one purpose, and one purpose only, to count the votes. That is our role. That is the beauty of these mahogany boxes that are being brought over from the Senate. They are the repository of the certificates sent by the governors, which embody the will of the people. You're in the game. This is it, you know? And we have to be ready in a timely fashion, and the more quickly we can have the votes, the more quickly we can designate Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, president and vice president of the United States. I just want to say this and close in this way. Today is the feast of the Epiphany, January 6th. Visit of the Magi, the rest of the world seeing the birth of Christ and that. Let us pray, in any way that you do, for our country. And that today will be an epiphany for the American people as they see the difference between our respect for the oath we take versus what they're up to. And let us hope that they will see the light and have their own epiphany on the other side. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald J. Trump. Hundreds of thousands of American patriots are committed to the honesty of our elections and the integrity of our glorious republic. All of us here today do not want to see our election victory stolen by emboldened, radical-left Democrats, which is what they're doing. And stolen by the fake-news media. That's what they've done and what they're doing. We will never give up. We will never concede. It doesn't happen. You don't concede when there's theft involved. It's very dangerous, what he's doing. He's getting all these people to show up and protest, "Stop the steal." He's putting all these crazy ideas in their head. And after this, we're going to walk down. And I'll be there with you. We're going to walk down to the Capitol. And Mike Pence is gonna have to come through for us. And if he doesn't, that will be a sad day for our country. They're marching up. You can see them marching up. Our country has had enough. We will not take it anymore. And that's what this is all about. They told him they don't have the resources to protect him here. So at the moment, he is not coming. But that could... Change. I hope he comes. I want to punch him out. I would pay to see that. I've been waiting for this. For trespassing on the Capitol grounds. I want to punch him out, and I'm going to go to jail, and I'm going to be happy. Look at the protesters outside the Capitol. USA, USA, USA. You remember when you were a boy and all the protesters came to protest the Affordable Care Act? Okay, go get them, Mimi. Oh, my god, how did that guy get up there? Is the Speaker balcony open? What if they try and run the Capitol? USA, USA, USA. USA, USA, USA. Mr. Vice President, I, Paul Gosar, - from Arizona's 4th Congr- - For what purpose does the gentleman from Arizona rise? I rise up for myself and 60 of my colleagues to object to the counting of the electoral ballots from Arizona. Is the objection in writing and signed by a senator? Yes, it is. The two houses will withdraw from joint session. Each house will deliberate separately on the pending objection and report its decision back to the joint session. The Senate will now retire to its chamber. The voters... the courts... and the states... have all spoken. If we overrule them... it would damage our republic... forever. You're our fucking brothers! Wake the fuck up. Rioters, see you at the top. Go, go, go. Watch out. Watch out. Fuck you, police. We're breaking the windows. This is our country. I'll be making a call, head south. - We're going in there. - Okay. Holy shit. Nancy, Nancy, Nancy. Holy shit. We've paid for everything. Fuck these people. Hey, hey, anybody want Nancy's fucking boxing gloves? Hey, hey, dude, you want Nancy's pink boxing gloves? I'm not turning my phone off. I want them to know I was here. This is my house, my country. Fuck Nancy Pelosi! We're here until what? Until the National Guard decides to come and get rid of these people? Where the fuck are they? Hey, let's take a seat, people. There has to be some way we can maintain the sense that people have that there's some security or some confidence... that government can function. And that we can elect the President of the United States. Did we go back into session? We did go back into session, but now apparently everybody on the floor is putting on tear gas masks to prepare for a breach. Let me see. There's a picture of someone sitting in the chair of the Senate. We've all been evacuated. There's been shots fired. We need a full National Guard component now. We have some senators who are still in their hideaways. They need massive personnel now. Can you get the Maryland National Guard - to come too? - Yes, sir. - Look at this. - Okay. Oh, my God. They're just breaking windows. They're doing all- It's just horrendous. And all at the instigation of the President of the United States. Okay. Thank you, Governor. Virginia Guard has been called in. You know, I'm just talking to Governor Northam. And what he said is, they sent 200 state police and a unit of the National Guard. debating in the House, debating in the Senate, And all of a sudden, John, we're told there's not... Okay, let's get him. But all these senators including the Vice President of the United States, they've been evacuated Personal safety is, just- transcends everything. But the fact is, on any given day, they're breaking the law in many different ways. And quite frankly, much of it at the instigation of the President of the United States. Yeah, why don't you get the President to tell them to leave the Capitol, Mr. Attorney General, in your law enforcement responsibility? A public statement they should all leave. We're treating this with the greatest- Will you ask the President to make a statement to ask them to leave the Capitol? So, as you might guess, we're coordinating this quickly No, no, no. Please answer my question. Answer my question. Move out. - Move out! - Get back! Come on! Got you loud and clear, Leader. This cannot be just, "We're waiting for so-and-so." We need them there now, whoever you got. I'm handing the phone. Hi, Mr. Vice President? Hi. Yeah, we're okay. We're here with Mr. Schumer, Mr. McConnell, the leadership, House and Senate. And how are you? Oh, my goodness. Where are you? God bless you. But are you in a very safe- Well, we are still not safe enough for us to go back. We're being told it could take days to clear the Capitol and that we should be moving everyone here to get the job done. We're at Fort McNair which has facilities for the House and the Senate to meet. We'd rather go to the Capitol and do it there, but it doesn't seem to be safe. Okay. And then call us back. Okay, I worry about you being in that Capitol, though. Don't let anybody know where you are. This was a fraudulent election, but we can't play into the hands of these people. We have to have peace. So, go home. We love you. You're very special. So, we shouldn't let him off the hook, Nancy. We issued a statement saying, he's got to make a statement, he comes up with this BS. Do you think we could get to the Capitol by 9:00, 10:00 tonight and finish this? Senator, I can't give you how long it's going to clear out or how many people are inside. So it's a really complex operation we're going to have to conduct to get to the inside The sooner you can get us, we have to make a decision whether to go back to the Capitol if it's safe, which we prefer, or do it here if it's not gonna be safe for a couple of days. Fuck CNN! Fuck CNN! Fuck CNN! Fuck CNN! Fuck CNN! Finish it! Finish it! Finish it! Madam Speaker, I'm at the Capitol building. I'm literally standing with the chief of the US Capitol Police. He just informed me their best information is that they believe that the House and the Senate will be able to reconvene in roughly an hour. Good news. We're gonna have to keep certain areas around the Chamber off limits because they're basically gonna be a crime scene. There's blood outside, you know, the lobby on one side by the parliamentarian. Careful, it's slippery. It's slippery. Oh, my God. They took the sign. They took the sign. Oh no, you shouldn't have touched any glass. - That's not up to you. - Well, we.. There's nobody else to do it. - So we had to do it. - No. There's security people, the cleaners who come. Well, they're busy getting the Chamber cleaned, so. Your blue bag, we just don't know, your blue bag, all of the contents were just thrown on your couch from the blue bag. - The blue bag's gone, but... - There was nothing in it. And your leather bag, they've secured in the Sergeant-at-Arms' office. - Yeah. - Your big leather bag. They didn't know if anything was in there, so they took it. I'm totally fine. I mean, none of this matters at the end of it all, anyway. - No, no, we don't. We just... - It's good. We're just tidying up know? Fuck Nancy Pelosi. Fuck Chuck Schumer! - Fuck Mitt Romney! - Let's go! Our house! Whose house? It is very, very difficult to put into words what has transpired today. I have never lived through or even imagined the experience like the one we have just witnessed in this Capitol. President Franklin Roosevelt set aside December 7th, 1941 as a day that will live in infamy. Unfortunately, we can now add January 6th, 2021 to that very short list of dates in American history that will live forever in infamy. We know that we're in difficult times. But little could we have imagined the assault that was made on our democracy today. To those who engaged in the gleeful desecration of this our temple of democracy, American democracy, justice will be done. We must and we will show to the country, and indeed to the world, that we will not be diverted from our duty. That we will respect our responsibility to the Constitution and to the American people. We always knew that this responsibility would take us into the night, and we will stay as long as it takes. Joseph R. Biden, Jr. of the State of Delaware has received 306 votes. Donald J. Trump of the State of Florida received 232 votes. The announcement of the state of the vote by the President of the Senate shall be deemed a sufficient declaration. Um, the security, I think- that will be a subject of review. But, right now, we have to stop this man, the insurrectionist in the White House. What do you think? and there may not be enough time. But there is enough time, and it's rather simple, to tag him with the uniqueness of a second impeachment. He's looking for a unique niche in life, being the first president ever impeached twice. And to put some kind of a freeze on him, because we don't know what he will do next. That's exactly right. So, they got through into this room? - Yes, ma'am, they did. - Yeah, you look on the left, that whole door's broken. - They broke the door. - Right, they broke they didn't break that one. No, and the kids were in there. Under the table. - It's very messy in there. - That's okay. I think we have it locked. - Sorry. - So it's very messy in there. Did they had to hide under the table -for almost three hours? - Two and a half. - Two and a half hours. - And then just in the... And they were here. And were they banging on this door? Were you one of them? Yeah, wow. Were they... Do they know people were in there? So we turned off all the lights, we hid under the table, and no talking. So we just said, "Do not speak." We in a very difficult place in our country as long as Donald Trump still sits in the White House. By inciting sedition as he did yesterday, a threshold was crossed of such magnitude that there is no way that this president should be allowed to make any decision. He must be removed from office. We are a country of law. We are not a monarchy with a king. Article of impeachment exhibit by the House of Representatives of the United States of America against Donald John Trump, president of the United States of America, in maintenance and support of its impeachment against him for high crimes and misdemeanors. Article One, incitement of insurrection. The President must be impeached. And I believe the President must be convicted by the Senate, a constitutional remedy that will ensure that the republic will be safe from this man who was so resolutely determined to tear down the things that we hold dear and that hold us together. Let us be worthy of our power and responsibility, that what Lincoln thought was the world's last best hope, the United States of America, may long survive. This is absolutely essential. I'm so proud of my members because one week ago, we had no idea about impeachment. We thought it'd be a calm day, a little contentious, to ascertain the president- who the president would be. We didn't think it would be an assault on our democracy. And so in that period of time, we have drawn up the article of impeachment and now passed it in a bipartisan way. On this vote, the ayes are 232, the nays are 197. The resolution is adopted without objection. The motion to reconsider is laid upon the table. This is America's day. We've learned again that democracy is precious. Democracy is fragile. And at this hour, my friends, democracy has prevailed. For now, on this hallowed ground, where just a few days ago violence sought to shake the Capitol's very foundation, we come together as one nation, under God, indivisible, to carry out the peaceful transfer of power, as we have for more than two centuries. It's over. How do you feel? I feel as if... an anvil has been lifted from my shoulders. How do you make peace the fact that because of your work, people wanna kill you? Being Speaker makes you a target. A target of misinformation, a target of mockery, and sometimes a target of violence. This is not for the faint of heart. I always tell this story. It was posted on a hospital in Africa. And it said, "When one day I die and happily go to meet my maker and I go before him, he will say to me, 'Show me your wounds. Show me your wounds.' And if I have no wounds to show him, he will say, 'Was nothing worth fighting for?'" And I'm proud of my wounds. Are you staying in leadership, Madam Speaker? What's on your mind today, Speaker Pelosi? Have you spoken to any of your deputies? When will you speak on the floor, Madam Speaker? How will you prepare for your speech today, Madam Speaker? Have you told anyone about your plans? Scripture teaches us that for everything there is a season. A time for every purpose under heaven. My friends, no matter what title you all, my colleagues, have bestowed upon me, Speaker, Leader, Whip, there is no greater official honor for me than to stand on this floor and to speak for the people of San Francisco. And with great confidence in our caucus, I will not seek reelection to Democratic leadership in the next Congress. For me, the hour has come for a new generation to lead the Democratic caucus that I so deeply respect. A new day is dawning on the horizon and I look forward, always forward, to the unfolding story of our nation. A story of light and love, of patriotism and progress, of many becoming one, and always an unfinished mission to make the dreams of today, the reality of tomorrow. Thank you all, may God bless you and your families, and may God continue to bless our veterans and the United States of America.
