Jeannine, I think it was fate that brought us together. You know, think about it. When I go walking into the unemployment office this morning, I'm not expecting to see anybody. I stand in line and I turn around, and you're standing right behind me. You know, that's crazy. And we started talking with each other. And now, here we are on our first date. Now, Jeannine, I'm gonna take a chance. Okay? I usually don't do this. I usually don't size things up this quickly. But I'm gonna take a chance, I'm gonna go out on a limb here. Jeannine... I think we were meant for each other. Whatever you say, Jim. Tim. -What? -Tim. My name is, uh, Tim. Whatever you say. How come all your credit cards have expired in 1980, 1984, 1976? Don't you ever throw anything away? Nah. I'm gonna go on and get some popcorn and, uh, we'll go to my place and see some movies, huh? Uh-huh. Be right back. Hey, bud. Have you got any number 7 copper wire? Some lady outside just lost her keys. Can't get her car started. Here you go. Hey, thanks. -Is that it? -Yup. Hey, where are you going? Hey! Where are you going? That's my car! I got Milk Duds! One, two, three, four! You want to return these, right? I want to return the three on the bottom and take out the three on the top. And put a goose in it, will you please? I'm double parked. I can't afford to get any more tickets. Besides, I got my groceries in the car and my ice cream is melting. Ooh. There you go, sir. Thank you. Uh-oh. Here comes the boss. Nancy? Yes, Mr. Wilhauser? We want to encourage business here, not drive it away. Yes, Mr. Wilhauser. Nancy, Nancy, Nancy... you're a wonderful little gal. But you just don't have any sense of merchandising. See, you got to give the people what they want. Not what you want. Yes, Mr. Wilhauser. And, Nancy, try to gain an appreciation for the public's taste. In time, you'll come to like it. Yes, Mr. Wilhauser. May I help you, sir? Yes, uh... you have any copies of, uh... Man-hungry Blonde Bitch? Ooh. Jeez, it's hot today. Ah. Hell of a time to be outside. It's a wonderful time to be outside. Oh, yeah, I forgot Ms. Nature-Lover here. Give me good, old-fashioned air conditioning any day. So, what are you reading? Pre-Columbian art and its effect on the Cubist movement. I don't know why you waste your time on those blockheads. Why didn't you take shop? At least you'd be surrounded by a lot of guys. Well, they don't offer shop at the university. Besides I'm not going to school to meet guys. Education is my life. That's your life? Honey, you need help. Uh, well, maybe you'll meet somebody at the store. No way. I spend my entire day renting out X-rated movies to horny middle-aged morons. Hey! Horny middle-aged morons have bucks. Find me an independently wealthy pre-Columbian Cubist. Honestly, Vicky, I spent ten minutes today trying to get out of a conversation with a man who'd just rented the movie Lick Me: Part 3. Part 3 is out already? Everything will happen in its time. I'll met the right guy someday. I'm just tired of going through all the wrong ones. Nance, you're 29 years old. You've been in college for ten years, and who knows when you'll ever graduate. Maybe it's time to move on. Now. Listen, I know a really great guy. I'm gonna give him your number. -Vicky, I don't-- -Look, I'm not trying to be pushy, I just hate to see such a great girl as yourself being such a mush. So I'm a mush. At least I'm my own mush. Oh, damn. Gotta go, honey. Dermatologist appointment. Beauty waits for no one. Especially me. You coming with Randy and me to Henry's tonight? Not to a steakhouse, no. Oh. They say they're grain-fed. Thanks. No, I'm going to the ballet tonight. Suit yourself. Ciao. A mush? Yeah, I got it. Seven... eight... nine... -Ten. -Johnny, good timin'. Better luck next time. Thought I'd find you here. I'm gonna beat that kid one of these days. Right. So, did I tell you? They found the jeep. -No. -Yeah. Completely totaled. Looked like Tokyo after Godzilla. Well, you're gonna get an insurance check, right? -Yeah. That'll pay off the loan. -Yeah. It's a good thing Mom gave you Dad's old Bug. Yeah. The adventure continues. So, I start a new job today with a big conglomerate. -What, you? -Yeah. I think this is the break I've been looking for. Well, that is great, because you know how Suzie and I feel. Yeah, I know, I don't set my sights high enough. Exactly. I mean, you're dating a convicted felon. -What is that? -Hey! You leave Jeannine out of this. She had a good personality. You know, I don't know why I can't find a good woman. God knows I try. Suzie says it's your own fault, man. Really? Great. Yeah. Suzie says you got to clean up your public image, -you know? -Oh. Suzie says you, like, act without thinking-- Yeah, you know, Suzie says a lot. What do you think? Well, I pretty much agree with whatever Suzie says. Hey, we think a lot alike, okay? Yeah, you guys are perfect for each other. That's right, Timmy. We are perfect for each other. We have absolutely everything in common. But it takes time to find someone like that. You have to divorce yourself from your feelings. You don't just grab anything that comes along. Yeah, maybe you're right. Of course I'm right. Yeah, I do seem to get myself in a lot of trouble. I'm telling you, Timmy. Careful, precise choices. - You're absolutely right. - Completely dispassionate. - Totally agree. - I mean, if you want to find yourself with an attractive, talented, intelligent, upstanding chick, then you're gonna have to-- Timmy, are you listening-- Timmy? -Hi, Beth. -Hi. Can I help you? Uh, yes. Who was that who just walked in? -You mean Tammy? -Hm. -She's one of our ad counselors. -Oh. Would you like to place an ad? Uh, uh... Yeah. Just wait over there. She'll be right out. And fill out an ad form while you're waiting. Can I help you? Do you want to follow me? Your ad form, please. You can sit down. You're gorgeous. Thank you. Is this the first time you've done this? Mm-hm. Yeah. I thought so. You have that look. Now, what do you like to do in your spare time? I, uh... um, I... I like watching television. Okay. Sports? Uh, I watch sports, yeah. No. I mean, do you play sports? Oh, "play sports." Of course I play sports. Well, what kind of sports do you play? Uh, well, uh... so, so many. Tennis? Tennis? Oh, yes, yes, tennis. I love tennis. Yes. And... and skiing. I love to ski. This is great. This is the kind of stuff we want, Tim. Horses. I love horses. You ride? I ride 'em, I race 'em, I just like to climb all over 'em. That's nice. I like horses, too. Really? You know, it's funny. I never would've taken you for the outdoors type. Oh. You know, that's funny 'cause a lot of people tell me that. I guess it's because I don't tan easily. Um, ever since the skydiving accident... What about cultural activities? Cultural activities? Yeah, for instance, do you like the theater? Which theater? Any theater. Do you... Do you go to plays? Oh, plays? Plays. I love plays. I can't live without 'em. When I'm not playing sports, I'm going to plays. You know, you are an amazing man, Tim. - Well... - What about food? I... I love it. I can't live without it. What kind of food do you like? Good food. Uh, gourmet. Gourmet. Mm. Uh, drinking? No. No. Well, at... at weddings. Hmm. Sex? No. No, I can't stand it. You can't stand sex? No. No, no, I... I... I... I don't hate sex. I love sex. When I'm not, you know, playing sports or, you know, going to plays, I'm... I'm having sex. Great. Well, that should do it. So, did I, uh, pass? This wasn't a test. I just needed the information so I could find the right girl for you. What about you? Oh, Tim... You're way too active for me. I mean, I'm pretty much a homebody. The minute I start running on the beach or playing tennis... I get so dizzy. But I don't do that all the time. I like to snuggle up on the couch and watch basketball games on TV. I'd bore you in no time flat. Well, you know, I've... I've got to admit that I've been thinking of mellowing out. My idea of recreation is lying in bed, making love to my man all day long. Yeah. Uh, can I... Can I ask you one question? -Sure. -Uh, How many ice cubes do you put in your drinks? Ice cubes? Mm. Yeah. How many? Actually, none. I prefer crushed ice. Well, that's some consolation. Excuse me, Tammy. The painters have finished. You can go back to your office now for your next interview. Okay, Mr. Carlson. Thanks for letting us use yours. Your ad will begin running tomorrow. I can't believe that date didn't work out for you last night. He just wasn't my type. Not a great talker. Ha. Of course he wasn't a great talker. He's a delivery man, honey. If his IQ were five points lower, he'd be a geranium. Then why did you set us up? Because, well, he was willing to go out with you. Oh, thanks a lot. So, did he try getting his hands on you? Yeah. He tried. And what happened? I told him to stop. Why? Because I like to get to know a man before I start all that, Vicky. I mean, the only thing I knew about this guy was that he wasn't too fond of showers. And I don't think he understood English too well. I mean, he didn't get the message when I told him to take his hands off, so... I had to use a more direct approach. Such as? I told him I thought I heard somebody breaking into his truck. No, no, no. This guy is different. I mean, I wouldn't call him an intellectual, but he can read. Well, that's certainly a step up. Hey, Nance, have you seen these Loveline ads? Loveline? Yeah. You know, it's like the personal columns. People looking for other people. You think I'm low enough to stoop to that? A lot of people do this, you know, Nance. It's not so crazy. Yeah? You want to do what to me? Who is this? No, I don't have any interesting scars. I think you got the wrong number. No, I didn't put an ad in a newspaper. Oh! Yeah. Yeah, that's me. Uh, but you don't want to go out with me because, um... I have leprosy, and everything keeps falling off at the worst moments. Oh, God. I can't believe I did it, John. This is the worst thing that I've ever done. I mean, I lied so much in this ad that... you know, I came out as a cross between Hugh Hefner and Ted Turner. I mean, you know, so far I've gotten calls from three hookers, two gay guys, and a nun. It's killing me. You know, how I hate turning people away. Got to go. Great way to end a phone call. Make them think you're busy. They'll see that as a sign of success. Oh, and speaking of success, we're starting our expansion to the sixth floor, and you will be the first to go. Now that sounds terrific. So what do you think, Tim? You think the big guy will go for it? I mean, 20% over 15 years. It's a good deal, Tim. Think about those futures in pork bellies. Don't you know the future's in pork bellies? And if you pull this one off, I got a big defense deal for you. Hey, you married, kid? Why does your office sound so strange? You in the hallway or something? So you still haven't found anybody who you like in here? None of those guys sound like my type. Mm. You got to stop thinking of your type of guy. Live a little. So, how was your Brazilian date? Oh, Nance. Coffee is not the only thing they know how to grow down there. You're changing the subject. Oh! Here. This looks like exactly what you need. "Mid-twenties, man of the world. Looking for fun, active girl. Uh, must like tennis, skiing, camping, and all kinds of sports. Appreciation for food and theater a must. Anything goes, if you're up to it." "Anything goes"? That can mean anything. Nance, you got to start living on the edge. I don't want to live on the edge. I like a nice, safe middle. Besides I don't play tennis or ski. What would a man of the world want with me? Stop trying to tell me what you are. Start thinking about what you want to be. What have you got to lose? "Good food and theater" part sounds nice. Hmm. So, what do you say? Shall we go for it? Okay, come on, let's get it inside now. Inside. Not-- Come on! Okay, get back. Get the hands up. Don't let him do it! No, not the layup! Come on. Come on. Baby needs new shoes. Come on. "Baby needs new shoes"? Johnny, you just missed the play of the game. Oh, yeah? What's the score? Tied. Third period. Come on, now! I got to tell you, these refs are getting paid off or just... Something on the side, because they are not blowing whistles. Ooh, whoa, yeah! Can you-- What? What is this? Hey, Timmy. What's that noise? -What noise? -That. Oh! That's my new neighbor, Mr. Andras. The guy's a maniac. He gets more action in one week than I've seen my entire lifetime. Hold it down, up there! Oh, Timmy, come on, your phone's off the hook again. Yeah, that's the way I wanna keep it. No! Hello? You want who? The guy that placed the ad? Oh, yes, just a minute. I believe he's here. The guy that placed the ad. This is the third world. Hello? Is the man of the world? Well, not exactly. You see, I have lep-- Hold on a second. I have someone who wants to talk to you. Talk to him, dumbo. Hello. Yeah, is the someone there? Uh, yes. Uh, I'm calling about your ad. You sound like a very nice person. And I think I'd like to meet you. Come on. Tell him how beautiful you are. Yeah, you... you sound nice, too. Oh. I am a nice person. I'm also pretty. Extremely pretty. I'm gorgeous. Wow, that's great. I'm... not too bad-looking myself. You also sound very outdoorsy, uh, sports and all. That sounds like fun, you know. Well, you know, uh, skiing, hiking, tennis, I love 'em all. How about you? Uh... yes. I like to keep active too. You also sound cultured. What kind of theater do you enjoy? Theater? Yeah, you know, I like... I like going to plays. I like plays. Oh, so do I. Uh, a good Restoration comedy or a Greek tragedy to provide food for thought, don't you think? Whatever you say. So, do you want to go out to dinner, say, Friday night? This... this Friday? Uh... well, yeah... yeah. I... I guess. Uh-huh. Mm-hm. Great. Okay, got it. So, we'll... we'll see you then. Yay. Wainwright shoots, he scores. Hello. Tennis? You play tennis? Timmy, the closest you have ever gotten to a net was when you were nine and Mom and Dad almost had you committed. I played a couple of times in high school. Okay, fine. And hiking? What about hiking? What's the big deal? You put on shoes, you walk through the forest. Timmy, the grocery store is a block away, and you drive. That's because I'm in a rush, not because I can't walk. Oh, and skiing. When have you ever tried skiing? Never. But I've seen pictures. I mean, it doesn't look that tough. I'll pick it up. Oh, boy, you're really in it now. What can I do? I mean, tell her everything in the ad was a lie? Besides, you're the one that keeps telling me I got to improve myself. Wait a minute. I was talking about a lifetime project, not an overnight metamorphosis. You're really gonna go for the whole nine yards on this, aren't you? I got to. I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna lend you one of my suits. What? You'd do that for me? Yeah. The shoes? Shoes. And the tie? Tie. And the car? Car? I feel like I should carry a sign saying which credit cards I accept. Well, thanks a lot. That happens to be one of my best outfits. I think you look super. Are you sure it won't scare him off? Well, no. No. Not once you get the right makeup and shoes. Right now, it looks like you're standing outside and this fell on you. I don't know, Vicky. I'm having serious misgivings about this whole thing. Well, don't. Now, sit up straight. Remember to laugh at everything he says. And loosen up. Have some fun. Oh. What if he's like everybody else? If he puts his hands on me, I'll scream. Look, I gave you my mace cannister and my rape whistle. He'll think he made a pass at Bernhard Goetz. All right. Now, this is Windsor knot. Are you paying attention? -It's hard to breathe. -Okay. Well, it pays to live your life with style, Timmy, my boy. Arms, please. Now, we could strategically place a monogrammed handkerchief to the breast pocket. Although, I believe that would be over-accessorizing just a tad for this occasion. Besides, they're my monograms. I don't think this is gonna work. She's gonna know right away that I'm an ordinary slob. Timmy. If you want to be a success, you've got to think success. Remember, you're only as good as you believe you are. You're right. I'm successful. I'm in control. That's the spirit. I'm a man of great power. I can move mountains. And I can change the destinies of the oceans. Women faint at my feet-- No, no, wait. They don't faint at my feet, they grovel. Because if they faint, they can't grovel. I can choose any woman I want. I am irresistible. I am a stud! Easy, Tim. Breathe in. You must be Tim. I almost forgot about our date tonight. Please, forgive the way I look. I'll just fetch my wrap and we can dash. You must be Tim. Come in. Sorry I'm late. It's a tough place to park around here. City sanitation trucks all over the place. Yes. It is a bother, isn't it? You just never can tell when a sewer's going to explode. Ah! Can I get you a drink? No, no. -Some tea? -No, no, no. No, thanks. This is for you. It's real. Oh! Thank you. That's very sweet of you. I'll get a va-- vase. I'll just make myself at home. Oh. Please. Foster... Anderson set a good screen, gave him the ball, and Rodney puts it in. And that is Rod's sixth point-- Hoo. Just checking the latest Dow Jones averages. Hey, that's a nice coat. Would you help me put it on please? Oh, sure. Sure. Thank you. So, you lived here long? Heavens, no. This is just a temporary pied-a-terre, just to dash in and dash out. -Shall we dash? -Yeah. So, what line of business are you in, Tim? Uh, it's diversified. Uh, you know, I have my own company. Uh, we're pretty heavy into the financial markets. Uh, we also have a few defense contracts. We put new weapons through their paces for the government. Weapons? Uh, you mean, kill people? No. No. No. No, no, no. Uh, we work only with the highly sophisticated, uh, new, uh, top-secret weapons. They mainly just stun people. Oh, you're very witty. So, let me guess what you do. Clothes designer? -No? -No. No. Um... I'm in, well, uh, I guess you could call it the, um, scholastic sector. Uh, education. Oh. You're a teacher? A professor. I'm... I'm a professor. Oh, does this mean I have to call you "Doctor"? Well, you don't have to be that formal. You can just call me "Doc." So, what do you teach? What do I teach? What do I teach... Um, history. I... I... I teach history. Oh, that must be very interesting. History, uh, has its moments. Would you like to begin with hors d'oeuvres? Uh, what would you suggest? Well, our caviar's excellent. It's fresh from the Baltic. Oh. Frankly, I don't think I can bring myself to eat baby fish eggs that were gutted from a pregnant mother fish. Uh, escargot is also superb. It's sauteed in a delicious garlic and butter sauce. Snails can be cute and slimy, but never food. Uh, why don't we just start off with a couple of dinner salads, okay? Oh, that sounds great. I should've thought of that myself. And for your main course? Well, would you like to make a suggestion? See anything you like? Oh, yes. I believe I'll have the baked potato. Buttered sour cream with chives? Yes, please. It's a fine choice, madam. It's a fine ch-- And for you, sir? Uh, can I ask you a question about this one? It's our first date. I had no idea. Do you want to see her again? -I guess so. -Be careful what you order. What do you think about the rack of lamb? No, that's no good. It'll probably remind her of Mary-- What about the duck a l'orange? I wouldn't chance it. Look, perhaps she wouldn't be offended by something basic. Such as? So, was it the veal parmesan you decided on, sir? Uh, no. It was the next one down. Uh, yes. The prime rib. No. Look, I'll take this. -It's a shark. -It was killed in self-defense, I'm sure of it. I'm sorry about the fuss. It's just that I find eating flesh of animals repugnant and disgusting. I mean, when you consider that a poor baby lamb is raised solely for the privilege of having his throat slashed and his bowels excavated... Nancy, I think I get the idea. How do you feel about bread? I'm sorry. I'm usually not this particular. It's all right. Don't give it another thought. You know, I'd quit eating meat myself if I wasn't afraid it was gonna kill my sex drive. Well, Tim, it's, uh... been really... Words aren't necessary at a time like this. They aren't? No. Shall I... come in? Sure. O... Okay. Yeah. Okay. I enjoyed being with you tonight... Doc. Uh, I had fun, too. Uh, would you care for some tea? No. Coffee? Nope. Wine? Water? No. Wheat Thins? Cheez Doodles? Just this. You all right? I really, really want to build a relationship first. I'm... I'm sorry. I... I just thought, um, that's what we're supposed to do. Maybe, uh... I should, uh... go. That would be good. Good night. Pork bellies. I want December pork bellies. And if this guy is crazy enough to call you back, I think you should go out with him again. I don't think so, Vicky. I mean, he makes weapons for war. Hey, don't knock war. A lot of great movies come out of war. Besides, if nobody created new weapons, what would happen to the toy business? Let's see. I Drink Your Blood, I Eat Your Skin, I Dance on Your Corpse, I Spit on Your Grave. Have a nice day. Hmm. Getting into some heavy drama tonight, huh? I'm planning on a very intense weekend. Either of you two care to join me? Sorry. We return to the womb on the weekends. Oh. Ew. And the worst part of it was the evening didn't start off so bad. I mean, I was actually beginning to like Tim. He had a kind of goofy charm... till his animal urges took over. You have to make up your mind sometime, Nance. I already have. Carnivore is not for me. That carnivore has bucks, and knows how to spend 'em. That doesn't mean much to me. Oh, I don't know, Vicky. Listen, Nancy, you cannot keep avoiding relationships. I really believe that out there somewhere, somebody perfect... I got it. My phrenologist. Phrenologist? The bald-headed Indian who walked on your back? No, no, no, no. Fred, remember? You know, the guy who told me that I was going to be visited by my mother, by feeling the bumps on my head, and then the very next day, she dropped by? Your mother drops by every day, Vicky. This is like a vision. This is perfect. You and Fred together. My uncle Arnie was put away for having visions. Listen, if I'm wrong, you can take away my credit cards. Let me just sleep on it, all right? No. Now, I can't do everything myself, Nancy. I mean, you're gonna have to make some kind of effort. It hurts me to see you letting yourself go like this. Oh, I give up. How you doing, Mom? Okay. A little tired, but okay. My goodness, Timothy, the last time I saw you in a tie, you were a penguin in a school play. I should've known then what a pain it was. Greetings, This is Fred the phrenologist. I'm out reading somebody's head right now, but you can leave a message, and I'll get back to you. You only have a few seconds, so better make it theReader's Digest version. Ciao. Hi. Um, this is Nancy. I mean, my name is Nancy Bryant, and I-- Uh, this is Nancy Bryant. Um, Vicky Potter that perhaps maybe-- This is Nancy Bryant. Vicky Potter said we should go out. Five-five-five-six-seven O-three. Call me. Thanks. Have a nice... ...day. Yeah? Hello, Marty? This isn't Marty Rebello? You sound awfully familiar. Nancy? Tim? Yeah. Yeah. Hey, how you doing? Hey, I'm glad you called. I, um... I wanted to say... Yes? Listen. I just wanted to say that I guess I behaved like a jerk the other night. Do you know what I mean? I was under a lot of stress. Well, you have a very high-pressure business. I must say, I wasn't acting too mature either. In fact, I owe you an apology. So, what do you think? You want to give it another try? Sure. I mean... you're worth at least that much. Thanks. Uh, why don't we go, uh, to someplace that you like this time? Okay. I know a place. It's not as fancy as you're used to, but I'm sure you'll have a good time. In fact, I can get tickets to the Philharmonic if we go on the 12th. Whatever you want. You know, sounds great. Uh... uh... six o'clock? Good. Good, good. Uh, great. So, uh, see you then. This is really exciting. I've never brought a date here before. Now, the macrobiotic souffle here is wonderful. Papaya, sprouts, all loaded with vitamins. Good. Uh... Looks like the only thing in here with meat on is the cook. They just don't want you to poison your body. Excuse me. Have you decided yet? Uh, yes. I'll have the endive and sprout salad. And then the mezzani. Okay, fine. And for you, sir? Oh. Uh... The soy bean surprise sounds delicious. Thank you very much. Thank you. I'm so glad you ordered that soy beans. They're so good for your system. In fact, your body will feel all flushed out. Hey, well, that sounds good. And I know that you love theater and all that, but you just don't seem the type who'd go crazy over Beethoven's String Quartets. It was a very fulfilling experience. And I didn't mind eating at The Forbidden Planet. The Plentiful Planet. Well, whatever. I enjoyed the whole night. Yeah. I did, too. Oh, I'm so anxious to share new cultural experiences with you. I'm just brimming with new ideas. Paintings I want you to see, books I want you to read. Do you like books? Oh, yeah. Yeah, I love books. Oh. What was the last book you read? Uh, I believe it was the novelization of Staying Alive. Um, make yourself at home. The stereo's on the shelf. I made us some tea. I'd prefer a coke. Classic. I'm sorry. I don't keep that stuff in the house. Okay. Where do you keep it? Is it far? Actually, it's okay. Tea is fine. Thank you. You know, I'm really glad we had this second date, Tim. You're a lot of fun to be around. Well, I enjoy being with you, too, Nancy. I wish, uh... What? I wish... I knew what this piece was that we're listening to. It's Borodin. The "Polovtsian Dances" from Prince Igor. Prince Igor. Borodin. "Polovtsian Dances." Excuse me. I'll just get the tea. Those are my parents. I never knew your parents were trees. They're beside the trees. It's Sequoia. They went there before they were married. Your folks took vacations before they tied the knot? I'm shocked. Well, it made sense. A long weekend to find out if they were compatible. Well, I can't tell who looks more compatible, your folks or the trees. Well, Mom broke out in a nervous rash, but other than that... I'm here, aren't I? You know... a long weekend does sound nice. It does? It does. Someplace secluded, isolated, romantic. I know a place. It's a resort in the mountains. It has hiking, and skiing, and camping, and horseback riding, and tennis, and all the things you love to do. In fact, you could maybe teach me a few new moves on the slopes. You could say that again. What happened to your BMW? Oh, uh... That's in the shop. It's the only loaner they had. Well, is it safe? Oh, yeah, sure, it's safe. As long as we don't go over 25. Tim, will you hold my hat? 251, Tim. 251-- Here we are. Here we are. Great. Here we are. Oh. Well, what do you think? I think I want to put these bags down. Oh, Tim, I'm sorry. Let me help. -Thanks. -Oh, I think this is great. Look at the view! Are you okay? Oh, yeah. Yeah. So, guess I'll go to my room and get ready. Ooh. See you in, say, how's 20 minutes sound? Fine. That'll give you enough time to get ready for the slopes? Oh. Plenty. -Tim. -Yeah? Thanks for carrying my bags. You're welcome. -Oh. Tim. -Yeah? I'll see you in the lobby? See you in the lobby. Oh, Tim. Bye. Bye. What the hell am I doing here? Boy, it certainly is beautiful. And big. Yeah. I could just stay in the lodge all day and just look at it. Yeah, well, you know, that is a great idea. Why don't we just do that? You don't have to compromise yourself for me. I mean, let's just put our skis on and do it. Okay. But I got to warn you, I'm a little rusty. Well, this is my first time out. Th... This year, I mean. Yeah, it's, uh, my first time out this year, too. I guess that's why we're both a little bit nervous. Yeah. Let's see. You know, I do that every year. Let me give you a hand. Whoa! Hi. Do you two know what you're doing? We're just a little rusty. - Ma'am, come towards me. -Okay. I got her. Get me. Thank you. - Okay. You all right? - Yeah. Fine. Okay. What I want you to do now is put your poles on the outside hand... and look over your inside shoulder. Here we go. Wow, this is fun. Yeah, yeah. Look at that view. Pretty nice, huh? Oh. I'm afraid of heights. Why did we stop? -What's happened? -Don't worry. Don't worry. Probably just for a couple of seconds. Probably just some beginner having a little problem getting on. - Oh. - Let's just relax. Okay. Almost time to get off. You might have to help me a little. You got it. Your poles. Don't forget your ski poles. Your poles! Your ski poles! Get off the chair! Don't stop the lift. I wouldn't dream of it. I've never been so embarrassed in my life. Mm. You folks all right? Yeah, it looks like you need some new poles there. Whoa! Nancy! Go this way! So, did you folks have a nice fall down the mountain? $72 for ski poles? Well, that's cheap. I charged you for used ones. Hey, we got a fine ski day. It's all you do, snow bunnies and your hands on snow poles out there. Spring skiing! Do I love it! Yes, listen, we are going to party all night till the dawn's early, and then we're gonna ski all day, and shoo, shoo, shoo those blues away every day. Ha-ha! How's your drink? What? Your drink! Oh, it's fine! Thank you! You want to dance? -What? -Dance! It might be safer than sitting here. So you want to go back to the table and finish the drinks? Yeah. What happened? I'm hit. Just hang on, and I'll pull you up. I never knew dancing could be so violent. Yeah, it's a good thing the Red Cross was having its annual convention, or I think I would've bled to death. You know, I must say that you are a fabulous dancer. Well, I must say that you're about the worst dancer I've ever seen. Well, you know, I got to tell you, though, that the secret to dancing is experimentation. Well, I think tonight your experiment failed. So, you didn't have fun? It's a funny thing. Even with the body slams and the girl who kept pulling my hair... I have had fun today. So you're not sorry you came? No. Oh! Ooh. -What happened? -My jaw. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. -That's all right? -Mm. -Is it gonna be all right? -Yeah. You just have to be a little more gentle. Tomorrow will be here sooner than we think. Yeah. So, well... see you at breakfast? Okay. -Tim? -Yeah. Thank you. Do we dare go horseback riding tomorrow? We're gonna have a trained guy. What could possibly go wrong? I think getting out into the wilderness tomorrow will do us a lot of good. Yeah. Thank God for long weekends, huh? And did you remember to tell the rental place, two tents? - I did. - Thank you. Ladies first. Oh, okay. Ahem. All set? All set. Is it my serve? Tim? Pass it around. Pass it-- Look for the good shot. Pop it, Riley. Pop it. Two points. Hello. Okay, defense. Hands up. Get the hands up. Block red. Three seconds, Ref. What you doing? Lose the whistle? Come on! Stolen! Taken away. Johnson to Riley. Two points, it's a runaway. Smell that air. Mm, smells great. You know, this is what we probably should've done right from the beginning. Get away from all those people. They're too dangerous. You're exactly right. Oh, look. There's another one of those Xs. That's so we don't get lost. As long as we keep seeing those Xs, we'll know we're going in the right direction. Are you sure we have everything? I had the guide check it twice. -Oh. -Whoo! Boy, look at that. -Yeah. -This is beautiful, huh? -Oh, it's gorgeous. -Yeah. -Hey, let's take a breather. -Yeah. Oh. Hey. You stay right there. Oh, no, no, no. No. -I look terrible. -You look great. Okay, now tilt your head. Yeah, yeah. Turn a little to the right. Good, good. Makes for good composition. Do you do much photography? Eh, not anymore. I used to do it a lot, but I really don't have that much time. I used to work for the Daily Planet. Now come on, Turn your head to the right and try to look sexy. That's it. Now come on, look at the camera and smile. Get the right stakes. Yeah. These are them. You know, I think we would've been better off renting one big tent. Oh, you mean it's my fault that I requested two tents? No. I just meant... Would it have been any easier if we had one big hotel room? Look, I booked two rooms, and I never suggested any other arrangement. You're right, I'm sorry. It's just that I'm a little ratty after the fall. And I'm starved. I think I've got a low blood sugar. Little hungry myself. Look, it's gonna get dark before we know it, so, uh, you finish up here. Finish? Wait. Wait a minute, I don't know what I'm doing here. You're the camper. What? Look, you said you'd been camping hundreds of times. Well, never with these kinds of tents. Well, you're doing a great job. I think this looks fantastic. Now, look, I gotta go start a fire, 'cause we're gonna need a fire. Well, don't you need any matches and lighter fluid? Matches and lighter fluid? I don't need that stuff. Well, how are you gonna light a fire? Like I always light a fire when I gotta light a fire when I'm camping. Like the Indians do. Tim, I did the best I could. How's the fire coming? Well, it must've rained recently 'cause everything is damp. -Well, I have some matches. -No. No, no. What is need... is some dry kindling. Do you think you could find me some dry kindling? -Kindling? -Under trees where it's dry. I'm gonna check the tent. Well, I did the best I could. - Tim. - Yeah. Yeah. This is all I could find. It doesn't seem damp. What's wrong? I asked for kindling. -Well, there wasn't any kindling. -Okay, okay, okay. It's fine, it's fine. This is great. Why don't you go get the cooking utensils, and get that food ready, and I'll get this fire started, okay? -Okay. -Good, good. Now we're cooking. So, is that the way the Indians open up a can of beans? No. When the knapsack burned, it melted the can opener. Why did you put the beans in one knapsack and the can opener in another? Because, if I put the beans in with the can opener, the beans would've melted. Well, then, why did you put the can opener in with the TV dinners? I don't know! Well, no food, one tent, What next? Sorry I asked. Don't worry, the tent will keep us dry. This tent is sagging worse than my grandmother. Are you insinuating I don't know what I'm doing? Since you brought it up... Where are you going? The great outdoorsman is gonna go outside and dig a trench around this fabulous tent. I don't think a trench is gonna do it. Yuck! Yuck. The tent is up. I don't know for how long, but the tent is up. And I dug a trench completely around it. Well, then, I guess you do know what you're doing. You're the camping and hiking expert. Why don't you go outside and secure the tent? It's not just camping and hiking, how about tennis? People who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones. -Meaning? -You can't ski. -You can? -And I wouldn't have gotten this black eye, if you knew how to dance. And I wouldn't have lost control of my horse if yours hadn't backed into the electric fence. I didn't know he was gonna back into that fence. My point exactly. I rest my case. Oh! And that's another thing. Would you stop screaming? I think you blatantly lied in your ad. I did not. I happen to have experience in everything I said, I just haven't done 'em in a while. When was the last time, in a previous life? Oh, and you seemed so nice and innocent. When did you ever do anything you've done this weekend? Well, I wanted to learn how from a patient, experienced man. I shelled out good money so some novice can learn? You own your own business, write it off as a business weekend. Oh, it certainly was all business, wasn't it? Ooh, why does talking to you seem so pointless? 'Cause that's all you professor cats know how to do, is talk. That's why college is a waste of time. I'd rather take the school of hard knocks anytime. Well, I think one particular hard knock dislodged your brain. Nancy, don't make me cry. Where are you going? The Holiday Inn? Anywhere but here is fine with me! Oh, yeah? Well, you think I like sharing a tent with somebody who doesn't eat like an American? I'll have you know that the way I eat is, A, humane, B, healthy, and C, the future. Well, since your going out, you mind picking me up a cheeseburger, and some French fries? Oh. Oh, you beautiful car. Oh, no. - Oh, why! - Wait! I'll tell you why. Because the keys were in the other backpack. But I always keep an extra key on it. I thought this was a loaner. No, Nancy, it's mine. I don't care anymore. I just wanna go home. $452.33 for camping. Well, listen, uh-- Good thing it was used. Right. All things must come to an end, Nancy. Out of 180 units necessary to graduate, you have 502. Therefore, I am graduating you at the end of this quarter. Yes, Dean Kent. - Oh, hot dog. Just like an organ. - Beautiful. I told Harry I thought I'd be bored to death. Come one down to Paulby Motors. ...out about it. ...on one. Seven to six. Joey, talk about breaking a hand on the rim. Most broken hands, broken fingers, uh, come on the defensive end of the court. when you are underneath, jumping out, or jumping back up and your hand, you know, is coming against the back, but, um, you know, if the front of your hand hits the rim, you very rarely break it. In fact, I don't think I've ever seen a case of that happening-- Have you ever mis-shot one of those and hit the rim yourself? - With the ball on the break away? - -Yeah. - No. - Never? - No. - -We're sure if he misses from the line the Bruins can pull through to within two if they get one down here. ...what can we do? Audrey, it's no good. You should've seen the commotion in that locker room. I had to knock down three people to get this stuff we're wearing here. - Oh, let me, let me hold that old wet grass of yours. Do I look as funny as you do? I guess I'm not quite the football type. You... you look wonderful. You know if it wasn't me talking, I'd say you were the prettiest girl in town. Well, why don't you say it? I don't know, maybe I will say it. How old are you anyway? -Eighteen. -Eighteen? But it was only last year you were 17. Too young or too old? Oh, no, no. Just right. Your age fits you. Yessir, you look a little older without your clothes on. I mean, without a dress, you look older, I mean younger. You look a... We're gonna try out a new club tonight. Would you come with us? No, thanks. - A pox upon me for a clumsy lout... -Hmm. Rumor has it, there are two men for every woman at the palace. Gorgeous, beautiful men by the dozens. I hate clubs. I hate men by the dozens. I hope that jerk didn't ruin you for life. It's not him. I just have to quit spinning my wheels. Well, then, I have just the thing for you. No, Vicky. Stop trying to ruin my life! It's time for me to do what I want. Okay. You got it. Now, now, Nancy. Oh, pipe down, you little weedy. How did you happen to fall in? I didn't fall in. I jumped in and saved you. You what? You saved me? Well, I did, didn't I? You didn't go through with it, did you? -Through with what? - Suicide. - It's against the law to commit suicide. Hi. Hello. Uh, I hope I'm not disturbing you. No. No. No. No. I, I was just sleeping. Sleeping? It's only 7:30. Yeah. I haven't been feeling too good. Me either. Can I come in? Uh... Yeah, yeah. Sure, sure. Maid didn't come in today. Have a seat. No. I can't stay. I just came by to give you a check for half the rental equipment. That's very sweet, but I don't want your money. No. Please, take it. It's okay, really. Don't even worry about it. I put it on my credit card. Well... I also came by to apologize. Bless you. Thank you. You were right. About people living in glasshouses. I'm not a professor of history. I'm not a professor of anything. I'm a student. A career student. And next month, I'll be out in the real world. I quit my job today. Well, it wasn't much of a job. And right now, I'm trying to figure out what to do with my life. Probably, um... Figured out that I'm... ...not really a millionaire industrialist. I had a feeling. I'm just a regular ol' underachiever. I used to, uh, test smoke alarms. Then I got laid off, and then I got this weird job at this big conglomerate, and I'm still really not even sure what I do. I was just thinking that maybe we could try it as ourselves and see how it goes. Well, Nancy, we are different people. I mean, you, you're a... you're more, uh, refined, you know, than I am. I mean, I like to watch basketball games, and I like to belch a lot. I could try it. It wouldn't work. Why not? Well, because... Ah... Because I'm seeing another girl now. This is, uh... This is her. She's at least beautiful. Yeah. Yeah. She sure is. Well. I feel a little foolish. Don't. Please, don't. Maybe I better go. I had fun with you, Tim. I had fun too. Play some basketball, mister? Mom, you're the greatest. But I'm 29 years old, and it's time I started doing these things myself. Are you sure you know how? Get out of here. I'm happy to see that you're growing up, Timothy. Well, I guess everybody has to. How are things going with that girl you've been seeing? Terrible. I've really screwed it up by lying my face off. Lying? Why did you do that? What do you mean, why do I do that? Everybody does it. Everybody? Everybody who gets anywhere. But I'm telling you, Mom, I'm through. From now on, I'm gonna be myself. If the world doesn't like it, tough. Let me show you something. Remember that? Yeah. It was you and Dad on your 20th anniversary. Believe it or not, that's the first time I ever got him out on the dance floor. He didn't even dance at our wedding. Thought it was foolish. Hmm. So what changed his mind? Time, I think, and... learning more about life. I think after 20 years, he decided to take a shot just to please me. And you know what? He had a great time. Yeah, I remember that. Yeah. He knocked over the punch bowl and nearly drowned the whole band. They even sounded better after that. It is a small thing, the dancing, but it was important to me. That's why our last few years together was so good. He would do little things to please me. Like bring me flowers at 2:00 in the morning. -Dad did that? -Mm. Oh, we still had our differences, but we learnt to respect them, and appreciate them. I don't know, Mom. There's a lot of lunatics out there. I mean, how do you know when it's right? I mean, when do you know it's the right person? You'll know. Just listen to the man upstairs. Who? Mr. Andras? Not Mr. Andras. Higher up. Oh. He'll let you know. Maybe not with fireworks and violins, but small signs. Little signs. Why don't you give that girl you lied to a call? Knock over a punch bowl or two? Busy? I was sleeping. Sleeping? It's two o'clock in the morning. You should be out dancing. You're crazy. Absolutely crazy. I found these flowers and I had to give 'em to somebody. I'm, uh... ...sorry I hurt you. That's really sweet. I must look a mess. No. No, actually, you... You look lovely. You look sleepy, but... you look lovely. Thank you. What about your, uh... pantyhose friend? That was my last lie, I promise. I see. I, um... I, um... thought I hated you. But I was wrong. I... love you. Wait a minute. Let's not go so fast. Let's take some time with this. Okay. I'm willing. Me too. Uh-oh. I'm happy, you bozo. Are you sure? Yes. You think you can trust me? I don't know. Let's just say I'm living on the edge. Let me have a minute to pull myself together. Okay. But hurry. Help yourself to anything in the refrigerator. Okay. In fact, I'll have what you're having. Sounds wonderful. One, two, three, four. One, two, three... Does this mean I have to eat soy bean surprises? Only if you really want to. Here's to wanting to. Ah.
