Relax, it won't be long, Aubrey'll be home soon. Sure got some strange taste in clothes. You about the same size as Aubrey, aren't you, old man? This I gotta see. Alright, Miller, say it. How's this? Lomax, why don't you sit down. Billy, check the window, see if you can see his car. You can spot it a mile away, it's a bright orange Cadi. Nothing yet. Lomax, why don't you give me a glass of water? Then drink it yourself. I'll give you something to do. His car just pulled up. There's someone getting out with him. - How is he dressed? Lomax, on his worst day he could handle you. Hit the lights. Damn it! Where is he? God damn it, where is he? Where is that key? Hello, Aubrey. Hello, Steele. What do you want? Want? We don't want anything from you, Aubrey. You might even say we're going to give you something. What you going to do to me? Well... First, Aubrey, we're going to shut that whining mouth of yours. Here, Aubrey, fix your make up. Lomax... You know I've been meaning to tell you for a long time that cigar of yours stinks. Don't you think it stinks, Aubrey? Yes or no? Don't you think it stinks? Yes, yes it stinks. Then, Aubrey... Why don't you put it out for us? Just to make sure the smoke doesn't bother you any more, Aubrey... we'll take off a little bit of your nose. Why bother, he's dead. What about his friend here? Why did he do that, it's 12 floors? - Nah, it's only nine. You don't like this country music? Not much. - Not much... Something bothering you, kid? Something bothering you, kid? What's the matter? I said what's the matter? I didn't know you were going to kill him. It just happened, that's all. A lot of things just happen. That didn't just happen. Yeah, forget it, kid. ... Disappear for a while. Yeah, Lomax is right, kid. I'm sure these folks wouldn't mind putting us up around here for a while. Lunch, grandpa. Want something to eat? - Maybe some nuts. I'll go with you. D'you have fresh fruit? - Down there. What about potato chips? - Down there. You call this fresh fruit? We just got it yesterday. Then you eat it yourself. We're very sorry. Please take another one if you like. Hear that, Lomax? I say she should have some of her damn poisoned fruit. Lomax... Here, you try some. A little higher. That's it. Try something bigger. Ready? Pull. We better split. - Why, I'm just getting hot. Lady, you sure got some nice melons. I bet she's got some other nice melons too. I don't think she understands. Lady, I want you to take your blouse off. Now... 1... 2... 3... 4... 5... Damn it lady,,, The lady wants you to give her a drink, old man. Damn, I forgot whether you wanted salted or plain. My business where I work as a meat cutter, down here... Barbara... The question again: When your husband goes to bed at night, does he become a lion... Frances, a lion, an ostrich or a kangaroo? Kangaroo! That's it for the show today, we hope you'll tune in tomorrow. Thank you very much for watching and we'll see you then. Goodbye! Little Maria is only three years old and an orphan, but she has plenty of brothers and sisters to play with. Maria and 200 other boys and girls live here at the home, sponsored by The Hope Association. They are truly one big family. If you'd like to help a child like Maria, write The Hope Association... I heard something upstairs. Yeah, I know, I saw someone. What do you want? We don't mean you any harm, ma'am. We have a sick friend out in the car. He needs a place to lie down. There are hotels up the road. For all we know he's pretty sick. Let me talk to your parents, they might be more understanding. I don't have any parents. It's only me and my grandfather. Grandfather? You live with your grandfather? This place will do just fine. He seems to have gotten much better already. But I think we'll still take you up on your hospitality. Why don't you kind of get us something to eat? Pull the car behind so nobody can see it. - Right. Get your grandfather down here. - I can't, he's paralysed. That's too bad, but I think I better take a look anyway. Eating raw eggs? - They're good for this sort of thing. Hey, how does he... - Oh, Lomax... The cops, better check the window. Better send them away. Send them away so they don't come back. They're going. - You sure? - Yes. Well, I guess gramps gets to see the ending after all. Looks good, ma'am. Why don't you join us? I'm not hungry. Join us anyway. I sure could get used to this home cooking. Lomax, you're splashing me. Not bad looking cook, eh Steele? Kind of makes you want to eat. Billy... Check the radio, see if we're on the news yet. Where'd she go? At least she could have kept her guests company. I think I'll make it my official duty to keep an eye on her. Why don't you leave her alone? Don't talk to me like that, boy. Yeah, Billy boy, you've been acting funny all day. Billy you snap out of it. Excuse me. What was that? - I don't know. Damn it, where the hell did he go? Lisa... Lisa, I'd like to talk to you. Look, I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. Hey, look what I found. What do you know... Grandpop here was once a real life soldier boy. And a colonel to boot. Invite him to a John Wayne movie. You like that, gramps? How about a nice girlie show? What's this? Better up, gramps. Why don't you guys let up? Look, Billy boy, either you straighten out or we'll straighten you out. If Lomax wants to have a little fun with old Jackass here, he will. So... Beat it. Wonder what's bugging Billy? Who knows, he's getting out of hand. A nice looking woman. She's OK, but let's not press our luck. Especially with Billy so damn touchy. Why worry, it's bugging me. OK? That's more like it, baby. You need any help? No, I'm alright. Come on, that's an awful big trunk. Where do you want it? Anywhere. Maybe in the attic. What you got in here, old bowling balls? This ain't going to be so easy. Maybe if we unpack it... - No! Don't unpack. Two more miles... Jesus! Who did this? Who? The other one. He said he'd kill me if I told. Why did he kill Lomax? He must be crazy. Is there any place we can go and talk and not be seen? Have you seen... Let's stop here. Lisa, I can't go to the police. I'm involved in a murder. Can you help me? Can you help me? I promise I won't let them hurt you or your grandfather. You're way ahead of me. I'll need that. Now go back there and if he asks where I am, tell him you don't know. OK? Lisa, have you seen Lomax or Billy? I think they went for a walk. A walk? They're nature lovers, figures. Fix me something to eat. Thanks. What were you doing? I had to go look in on my grandfather. - Why, he's not going anywhere. I don't want to eat alone. Join me. Sit down. You know you're... a pretty girl. A very pretty girl. ... Hear what I said? Hear what I said? I have to go and care for my grandfather. Your grandfather. You want to see your grandfather? You want to see your grandfather? Alright, we'll go see your grandfather. We'll both watch TV with your grandfather. We'll give your grandfather a real good TV show to watch. Wisecracker, has just upset Stop the World for one of the most absolutely outrageous upsets of the season. There are many disappointed fans in the field today. Where's Steele? I don't know. He was gone when I got back. He couldn't be far. His car's still out back. Let's just hope he didn't see us talking again. What are you doing now? I'm fixing my grandfather's lunch. OK, I'm going out to look for him. I can't find him. You haven't seen or heard anything have you Lisa? I made you some soup. Oh, god! That's one of them alright. She sure was right about it.
