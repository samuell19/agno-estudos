I want the graves kept neat. Your parents. My grandparents. You knew them ? I was a young boy when I knew them. I want you to buy a plot for me beside my grandfather. There is no room. Then as close as possible. I'll have to... Buy it. You're coming ? I have a few hours to kill. I don't. I don't speak yiddish. I'm looking for something for my wife. You have these candlesticks in the window. I have to close up for an hour. I'm going out to pray. Would you like to come back in an hour ? Maybe come with me. First visit to Israel ? Yeah, it's my first visit. But I've already been here a year. [ Yelling ] [ Hebrew ] [ Male ] ...Winner right there. Let's see money here, boys. More you bet more you get. Okay, that's six bits, you got four ? Two bits, two bits. You got it. You got it ? Alright. Coming out, coming out. We got a winner. Alright, yeah. See what you got here ? It's a seven, it's a seven. We got a winner. Here we go. Pay it up, pay it up. Who's up ? Who's shooting what ? What's happening ? Batter up. Can't win if you do not play ? Who's the new shooter ? We need a new shooter. Nearly a year is more than a visit. How much longer will you be here ? One or two more days. Or many years. I wish my grandfather could have seen them. An army. You know, the saddest thing a friend told me. Bunch of your school children, eight years old. They were telling them about Europe. About the holocaust. One of the kids says, why didn't we send our army ? Why didn't we send our army ? Yeah. You can join me or meet me back at the shop or... I'll wait here. Nice in the sun, isn't it ? Yeah, well, you know. Get old. It's warm. Good place to live. I think so. The more you bet, the more you get. Shoot 'em. It's his left hand. Place your bets, boys, place your bets. The more you bet, the more you get. See, Benny ? See ? Place your bets, boys. See what we got here. Alright, shoot 'em, shoot 'em. Coming up. Can't win 'em all. Alright. Here you go, here you go. I'm bettin' wit you. Too late. Snake eyes. Can't win 'em all, can't win 'em all. Hey, you owe me the four bits. No dice on the last shot. You collected his money. What the fuck you mean, no dice, you owe me. Fuck off ! Hey, no, you owe me ! Get them out of here. Are you crazy ? Are you out of your mind ? You want to fight ? I'll fight you. You want to fight ? I'll fight you with nothing. Throw down the knife. Throw down the fucking knife ! We'll fight you with nothing. Are you crazy ? We won the money ! We made the bet, are you fucking nuts ? Get the fuck out of here. You worked for it. Pick it up. You win the money, meyer. Bunch of kikes. You bunch of sheenies. Here I am ! Here I am ! Here I am, you fucking Mick pansy. Here I am, you cock sucker. You want to kill me ? Here I am. You're crazy. Are you okay ? Meyer, are you okay ? Yeah. Thanks, Benny. Two things. Listening to me ? Wade in and never fight fair. That's my advice to you. Anything else you'll figure out for yourself... What do you mean never fight fair ? Why'd you drop the brick ? Don't always go by me. Gets your heart beating, don't it ? Fighting ? Pick up your money. Shh. You do whatever you want to do with this, okay ? Whatever brings you pleasure. But never... Never gamble, jakelah. Unless it's your game. Shh. He stilled the rising tumult... He had the game go on. And with a smile of Christian charity. Great Casey's visage... Should be a smile of Jewish charity. Oh, no doubt. But that's not how that misguided son-of-a-bitch wrote it. Somewhere in this favored land. Somewhere bands are playing and children shout. But there was not joy in mudville. Hey ! It's the kikes. Take it off. Take it all off ! Show 'em ! Show 'em where they cut your dick off, you Christ killers. You're gonna pollute the river, you Christ killers. You people killed Christ ! My people didn't have time to kill Christ. You know why ? 'Cause we've been fucking your mother for five thousand years. Why is a Jew like a featherbed ? What does it do for you... To pray ? Who rises refreshed from his prayers, his prayers have been answered. And that's the truth ? I've found it to be the truth. Even for somebody like me ? You know who I am. I also knew who you were in '48. I was with haganah. I unloaded some of the guns. Rumors, you know ? They had come from the docks of New York through the good offices of yourself. You think your supreme court will remember that in their arguments today ? I would hope so. So... Let me ask you a question. Please. Your prayers... They've been answered ? It works for you. It's not like that. Does it work ? What I said... If I rise refreshed, my prayers have been answered. Here we go, coming out. Hey, tough luck, kid. Sorry about that. C'mon. Don't worry about it. Sometimes the rabbit wins, sometimes the dog wins. That's why they call it gambling. Tough luck, kid. New shooter, new shooter. New shooter here. Here we go, here we go. Place your bets. C'mon, c'mon. Here we go. 8's a point, 8's a point. Here we go, here we go. [ Whistle ] Cops, cops, cops ! Get out of here, get out of here ! So... How'd we do ? Doing good. Doing good. Wouldn't we do better with those dice the Irish prick used ? It's not hard to do. We don't need 'em, okay ? Benny, you don't understand. You don't need 'em. Hey, amscray. Meet you on the corner in ten minutes. Okay. Good day. Listen, Jew boy, you and your crap game can stay healthy for a buck a week. Anybody in the neighborhood fucks with you. You got a protected game. You're under Charlie Luciano's wing. It's cheap at a dollar and first week's due. Hey, fuck you ! Stick your protection up your dago ass ! Look, you send me players and you'll get a cut of their action. But nothin' for nothin'. Look, steer me players and you'll get a cut of their action. But you'll get nothing for nothing. Forget it. We'll come back for this heeb when his mother's tit milk's dry on his face. Nothing for nothing, huh ? Mazel tov. That, I know what that means. Thank you. Excuse me, sorry. Everybody's carrying a gun. People tend to be more polite. Jake guzik is at shul. They're auctioning off the third Aliyah. Yom kippur. Who wants to read the torah ? Third Aliyah. One guy. Five dollars. Next guy. Ten dollars. Next guy. 22 dollars to read from torah. Twenty-two fifty, Jake, hand in his jacket. Hand in his jacket like he's going for it. 450 dollars and I'm coming up ! I'm coming up ! Okay. Bong, bang, bang ! You done good, take this over there. Great. Thanks, Benny. Meyer. [ Chatter ] No, no, no. Come 'ere. Alright, Charlie ? Got it ? Yeah. You know, meyer, you're smart. What's more, you're good-looking. [ Male ] C'mon, let's go ! The computation of the current value of any hypothetical sum of at some future date may be expressed by the product of the sum, reduced by the number of years times the rate of interest times the formula. That thing tell you what's a hundred percent of four trucks full of hootch ? Bullets in the brain, you dumb fucking mockey. Never told you I was smart, I just told you I was impetuous. You didn't have to tell me. Three clergymen, they're playing poker. By the way tomorrow we're going to the bank and I'm going to show you-- what the fuck do you mean what's a hundred percent of-- you want to fuck with Joe masseria ? I'm just kidding, I'm just kidding. Lordy, you can't take a joke for Christ sakes ? Not about business. Somebody else with big ideas. Cover the back. The middle ! Watch the front, c'mon, go ! Go watch the front. How many are there ? Well, you called this to a "t". Bugs wants to whack 'em. Of course, bugs wants to whack 'em. You go to the barber, he's gonna tell you you need a hair cut. Alright, look. It's a stand off. You kill a few, we kill a few. You don't get the booze. Save it for another day. Today we don't got to mix it up, alright ? Now, here's what I say. We save it for another day. Alright, we call it a push. No dice. Quarter of load. I'll give you a quarter of the load. I'll give you a truck full. But nobody shoots. Alright ? We go home. We get laid. We have a drink on Joe masseria. We're walking out of here now. But we are gonna drive right past you. So whatever this thing is, so be it. I say save it for another day. Alright, that's good. How's masseria gonna feel, we give away a quarter of his load ? Few more minutes, he's gonna see that fourth truck's full of empty cases. A yiddish-cup. Sicilian balls. Balls are yiddisha too, Charlie. [ Laughing ] A rabbi and a priest are playing poker. Knock, knock, knock. Who's there ? You fellows are working for Joe masseria, huh ? Sit down, please. Yeah, we go out for him, from time to time. Uh-huh. Well, you're not going to go very far in that organization. What if we sew the end of our dicks back on ? That's my point, isn't it ? You know those were my people that stopped your trucks. Who would have guessed. What you did on the trucks... I admire your thinking. It's why I did it. I want you to come work for me. But I hear your friend here is a hot head. So, first thing... I want you to throw him to the wolves. Done. You'd turn your back on your landsmen ? For you, Mr. Rothstein... Mr. Rothstein, I will go him one better. You toss me the job, I'll shoot myself. Yeah, he'll shoot himself. That's what I want to hear. I heard... Tell me, what's 154 cases of liquor at 25 dollars a case ? 38 hundred and 50 bucks. So, you took the 1-54, doubled it to 3-0-8, then added the zero and then halved the 15-40 to 7-70 and added it, right ? I divided by four and tacked on the two zeroes. If I were to say to you, how would you bring liquor into New York, what would you say ? I would make it here. Yes, I'm talking whiskey, real whiskey, scotch whiskey. What would you do ? I'd bring them by the boat load. To long island. Alright. You've been doing your homework. Good. Now, look. You... ? [ Hebrew ] Never. You see, never write it down. Keep it in your head. You can't keep it in your head, you can't do business. And you sure can't do business with me. And last thing, which they say, goes without saying. But you may have noticed that something goes without saying, it just means you said it so... Don't skim. Huh ? You know, the best thing I can say about myself ? I always made money. My partners, my associates, always made money. Somebody cut me loose, I cut them loose. That's a punishment enough. That's punishment enough. In addition to which you iced 'em. They say violence never settled anything. It never settled anything, but it sure changed the subject, didn't it ? I'll tell you what. Empires, I'm not interested in. The people who work for me also work with me. We all prosper. You want to spread your wings a little bit with other deals ? Fine. Just so that it's not with masseria or maranzano. But out of town. Be me guest. Just never confuse your position with your best interest. Because sometimes the best way to protect your best interests, many times is to give up your position. I don't understand. You're a twist-hound, eh ? You want to get 'em on their backs. Sometimes the best way is to open the door for them. What does it cost you ? Sometimes you cut your losses, sometimes you take a small loss to make a large game. Your employer, Mr. Masseria, talks about saving face. I care about making money. [ Phone ringing ] Not the knesett. This is zev Ben-Dov. It's the American embassy. I'll inform my client. Washington has pulled your passport. What does that mean ? Meyer, that if the court votes against you and you've got to leave, the only country you can travel to is the u.S. Nowhere else ? If you can find a country that will take you as a refugee, Grant you asylum. Well... You know what it is. It's Nixon. It's John Mitchell. It's the degenerated corrupt old woman on the FBI. And I'll tell you what it is it's those damn attack jets. The knesset is afraid, they don't give in, the u.S. Don't send jets. That's what the hell it is. We haven't lost yet. Haven't lost yet. Been an odds maker my whole life. Just lost my passport. I'm gonna get thrown out. You tell me. For what ? Bronfman ? Ran booze, he's a national hero. Joe Kennedy, a shoot 'em-up bootlegger, now he's clean. Nixon's got burglars working for him. You kidding me ? I'm gonna get tickets. There are half a dozen plays opening this October that you'll just love. Fanny Brice. She's gonna be in this thing called, "sweet and low". Good. She's always good. Anna. Hmm... This is delicious. Delicious, Anna. Thank you, meyer. You'll be sure to be here if I get the tickets. Yeah. You'll make a point of it, right, meyer ? Yeah. Of course. I'll do my best. [ Phone ringing ] Excuse me. Hello. [ Male ] Arnold rothstein's dead. When ? About an hour ago. Alright. Yeah. Good-bye. Anna... Been called away. Called away ? What called away ? This is important. It won't take long. Finally you're here for my-- what is this ? Finally you're here for a meal. An hour at most, alright ? One facockta meal... You can't stay long enough to finish your plate ? Meyer. Meyer ? I'm married to doctor lansky. Are you a surgeon ? You get called away in the middle of dinner. Meyer ? [ Announcer ] ...Fort minutes ago in the park central hotel, Arnold rothstein, the man who fixed the 1919 world series, was gunned down. Rothstein died en route to Saint Clair hospital. Over a poker hand. Over a fucking poker hand. Gambling. Mishagas. I already heard from maranzano. He wants me to come in with him. First your face, then your throat. And masseria ? I heard from him too, he wants me to come in with him. Devil of the deep blue sea. Each of these fucking guys got a ring this big you got to kiss ! How's the crap tables doing ? They're doing good, they're doing good. You know, I read where general electric will sell 800,000 frigidairesthis year. Wool worth's... They got 11 hundred stores. 11 hundred. Americans will spend money when given the opportunity. We have a total of 14 crap tables in operation. Woolworths and general electric are nationwide, Charlie. Nationwide. That's the key. No more 48 states. It's gonna be one big country. With these two old grease balls out of the way. Like if they're dead ? Masseria... I could set up. That'll be a walk in sun. But maranzano, forget about him. There's no wops can get close to him. Not a problem. We'll have to plan these two carefully. We'll have a division of labor. Not such a bad way to start a thing. Nationwide combination money makers. Board of directors like g.E. Or woolworths. Directors who vote. Directors who vote. Salute. Senore. I gotta take a leek. Go, go. What the fuck happened out here ? Waiting ten or 15 minutes. Just missed a trolley. Ended up walking. Internal revenue service. Internal revenue service, we have a warrant here to examine the records of Salvatore maranzano. Christ sakes, two weeks ago you guys were here. The following records, please, sir. What the hell is this ? Internal revenue service. Again ? For the love of god. Mr. Salvatore maranzano. You know what harassment is ? Would you please step inside your office, please, sir ? Why are you wearing brown shoes ? What's that ? [ Gunshots ] That's for Charlie lucky. You happy, meyer ? You happy ? Are you happy ? You got the flowers ? No. I got them. Did you see him ? Still with the doctors. They're gonna bring him up soon. Your coat, nobody'll steal it, meyer. It's okay. I'll keep it on. You're going out of town again. What ? Yes. Anna, you know I have to go out of town. You can stay here for the least. For the least. You know, I wonder why we even had-- don't talk like that, Anna ! Alright ? What kind of a life do you expect me to lead, when all the time you're going-- [ knocking ] Where is he ? We're doing a few more tests. Tests ? It's not just a month premature. The boy is... Crippled. What ? We're not sure yet. Oh, my god. Veh is mir, veh is mir ! From god ! From god ! A klug on US ! It's alright. It's alright. My baby ! [ Screaming ] You know. You know, the question. The question they ask. Which is why I'm telling you. You should be screaming. Every zhid on earth. Because if the law of return is not meant for me, it's not meant for you. If Israel isn't just an amusement park for American Jews. What have you done for your country, Mr. Lansky ? Are you, do you consider yourself an American first or a Jew first ? You ever hear that question ? Eh ? Because the answer is not what business is it of yours, it's three bags full and you better be bending down to kiss their ring. Kefauver ? Are you kidding me ? The shit that man did. The money he took ? And he drags me into that... And he asks me what did I do for my country ? Joe Kennedy, 39. Ready to sell england to Hitler. To Hitler. They pull my passport and ask me what I did for my country... What I did ? Maybe they'll rule in your favor-- don't tell me how... Could bad news be good news here ? Huh ? Could the court put me out of the country, knowing ? Don't tell me how they're gonna rule. I know how they're gonna rule. So do you. So don't tell me. [ Phone ringing ] Hello. No word. You a Jew first or an American first ? You ask the question, that's the answer you want. What have I done for my country ? Last item on the agenda. Detroit. Detroit. What the fuck is it now with Detroit ? They're like a crew of delinquents out there. It's another god damned air raid drill. This time it's a beef with Philadelphia over counterfeit gas rations stamps. Zelelli cannot push into Philadelphia, meyer. It'll take care of itself. Who wants to touch counterfeit stamps anyway ? Blood money. Big dollars. We should be in it heavier right here. This is a war. I know whose side I'm on. And Charlie. I speak for Charlie on this. How's he doing ? How's he doing ? How's he doing ? How would you be doing in 30 to 50 in dannemora ? Mr. Lansky, right this way. As we wouldn't want your involvement revealed until after the war. I'm not sure I'd want it revealed at all. Well, you never know when you might need a friend. I appreciate that. And on the subject of my friend, Mr. Luciano. Yes. A pardon is of course out of the question. But you didn't come to the table empty-handed... After quid-pro. There's a quo. Ahhh. Hey, Charlie. How you been ? Holding on. You ? In for a penny, in for a pound. How's Benny ? Same thing all the time. Still chasing cooze ? Everybody needs a hobby. What's it all about ? It's about sicily, Charlie. We're gonna invade sicily. Our intelligence guys want to connect with what they call the people who really run sicily. [ Announcer ] A parachute doesn't bother this dog at all. ...for Christ sake. It costs what it costs. Yeah, what does it cost ? Numbers mean nothing to the man. It costs what it costs, what is he, setting fire to the money ? He's building, he's had some reverse-- you ever build a house, a building ? You have some reverse-- do you stand behind him ? Of course, I stand behind him. It's not him. It's him and all of US. [ Announcer ] And now the latest footage of the landings in sicily. Aided by the extraordinary cooperation of the populace, the allied advance continues to push forward into enemy territory. Follow me, sir. ... your tired, your poor, huh. Yeah. That's what they say. Right this way, Mr. Lansky. Champagne, meyer ? Where's bugs ? He's coming separately. He's busy ? No, he's coming in from the west. Ah-ha. I think he'll make it in, I talked to him. What'd he say ?two things. He don't make it, he said to say good-bye Charlie. And the party. Someone other than me picks the broads. [ Laughing ] What'd you bring me for my grand excursion ? What you cannot get in sicily. I give you to take with you. Kosher ! Fucking heeb. This guy, this guy ! He sprung you, so they can ship it back to a rock with goats on it. You want to do the rest of my bit ? Okay, okay. I want to propose something. I want to propose... A toast. We've been together a long time. We seen a lot of things together. All I can say is, this guy ! Salut. Getting in too deep. I'm not gonna say that it's not, 'cause it is. He says three mil, then he says maybe we're looking at four. Maybe. He says it takes 12 months, plus. It could take as much-- yeah, yeah. The thing is... Never what does it cost. But what does it make ? What does it make ? Now, the cost, we can lay off on the international. Up to a point, up to a point. In which they start screaming, "kill somebody". Kill somebody for me, I don't care who. Yeah, yeah, I give you my word. We get these hotels open, they're gonna erect a statue to this guy. Where is he ? Benjamin Siegel. One of the few men, the history of the world, created something out of nothing. Who remembers the name of this broad bugsy was balling worked in a bank ? Which broad ? Back after the war. Guys, we're making too much money, take it of out of the mattress, put it in the bank. Gets down to the bank, then he takes a look around. Fuck me. I ain't puttin' my dough in here. It's a shoebox. Turn on their heels, sun goes down, sun comes up, bang, hankies are on their faces, back to the bank, stick 'em up ! Benny goes in the vault. Here's the twist, she's up on a ladder. He's looking right up. I'm waiting for him, come out with the gelt, I look in... Long story short, it's affair of the heart. He's seeing this broad until he leaves Cleveland. We used to call her his "night deposit". Talk of the devil. Never talk of the fuckin' devil, you don't know who'd be listening. My profound regrets. Meyer. So... What happened to this freakin' party ? Benny, how you doin' ? Charlie... This is Virginia hill. Charlie, meyer. Joey a. I believe you two... Know each other. So... Why am I late ? I'm just off of the plane. Where have I come from ? Las Vegas. And how are things there ? [ Together ] Just how are things there ? You don't want to talk business. Spill it. You want to talk business. Even though the guy's going away to camp va fungu... Alright. Charlie. I brought something for you. Alright. I'm flying out of the dessert. Stop at a gas station. Middle of nowhere. Gas station. Slot machine. New sign. Proud lettering. New sign on the slot machine... Greater pay means longer play. I'll tell you that again. Greater pay means longer play. Ya gotta have something to do on that fuckin' island. [ Laughing ] The sign is advertising. You will go broke. You will go broke, that's what it means. Longer play. Longer to what ? 'Til you go broke. The freakin' sign is advertising what they all know to be true. That the machine will take all your money. And you know it and I know it. And you're gonna play anyway and the people are gonna play anyway. And you know they are and this is why. I know it like I know my own name. This is gonna be bigger than booze. It's gonna be bigger than broads. Las Vegas. Yes, it will. This, mind you... Is the biggest thing there is. Why ? Because everybody does it. Seems like an unconscionable length of time to wait to begin construction, but as they say, measure twice and cut once. A week, huh ? A week here, a week there. But when we're all rich... Why are you wearing brown shoes ? Huh ? What did he expect a fair fight ? Who wants to get involved in a fair fight ? Was there no one we could have paid ? Somebody had to be for sale. I wouldn't have done it, meyer. How did I get involved in a fair fight ? What am I ? I'm some chump, gonna say I did this, I did that. I checked box "b", how could they deny me. Meyer, how can they deny you ? They can deny me because they can. And they will. Who are we kidding ? Because they past-posted me. It's done. It's done. It isn't done, meyer. The court. It's not the court. It's not the knesset. It's the "g". It's the "g". It's the government. Eh ! You cut the phone lines to the United States justice department and I get my Israeli citizenship tomorrow. There was no mafia. What was it ? It must have been the Jews. It was the Jews, that's who it must have been. And if it was the Jews, it must have been me. What am I demeaning myself ? And I'll tell you. One country's like another. What do you think of that ? Two guys are walking down the street. Walking towards 'em, here comes Joe. Joe crosses the street he shies away. One guy says to the other guy, I don't know why Joe's avoiding me, I haven't done anything for him lately. The shit we did. You know how much armament we put through the Brooklyn pier in '48 ? Do you know ?i know. Ah, you don't know. But they know. The law of return. Every Jew on earth has a homeland to come to. Zion. We used to say, nobody loves the Jews. Charlie loved the Jews. Used to think he had a pintele yid. You know what ? Forget about it. Where are we going ? It's not over here, yet. Yeah. Where are we going ? For now, go home, meyer. Zev will call you the minute he hears from the court. Four bedrooms. "A lovely little house", the real estate woman called it. In the German sector. And she was right. Lovely. Paul called and buddy and Sandra. They all want to come next week. I hope you told them to wait until-- we're moved in and settled. Four bedrooms, meyer. Room. You should have waited until-- there is a law of return, meyer. Not a policy. A law. They won't put US... [ Phone ringing ] Yeah. Mr. Lansky, could you please give me a comment on your expulsion from Israel ? Mr. Lansky was not expelled, his tourist visa expired-- but surely you might reflect that man with drug charges. I beg your pardon ! My husband was harassed by the u.S. Department-- my husband had a vial, excuse me, of donnatol, which is an antacid, do you understand ? For his ulcer. An antacid and we were detained. We were searched, we were questioned ! How does it feel as a Jew ? Mr. Lansky is not inclined, if you might imagine, to answer any further questions at this time. As a Jew-- After the second war, three Jews, meet in a d.P. Camp. Discuss plans for where they'll go. First Jew says, "I'm gonna settle in england." Second Jew says, "uh-huh, I'm going to Canada." Third Jew goes, "I'm going to Australia." First Jew says, "isn't that a long way ?" Third Jew says, "from where ?" From where ? Paul, your father's in the study, he'll just be a minute. Come here. A pile of books like that... You're going to go blind. Where do you get it from ? Alright, now, where was I, Evelyn ? The plant and the dog. Hold the mail. Meyer. You tell him, you say to the guy, you have a grave responsibility. Of course you do. You have the worries, not only of your office. So on, but of being re-elected to that office. You're under a lot of pressure. Now, we have legitimate interests. Not only in hallandale. But in the development of Florida as do you. Dad. Yeah. It's goodbye, huh ? Have a good time. I will. Take good care of things here. So when do we hear from the point ? Dad. We aren't gonna hear for two weeks. You let me know. You got my itinerary ? You let me know the moment you know. I will. Okay. You be good. Nice kid. He's a helluva kid. Is he gonna get in ? Kinahora. The Jewish quota up there is this big. Where are we ? Kindergarten. Alright. Blah, blah, yeah. Legal fees. So to protect my interests. Hey ! I was staying home and I had the time I'd go down there. But as I'm not, you're going, so pay attention 'cause you muck this up-- how high are we going ? I would say we get this guy twenty. Go as high as 50k. Hmm, if he wants higher. Let's discuss it. The car is here, meyer. Goodbye, dad. Alright, let's get going. Take care of yourself, buddy. Thank you, Jackie. Federal bureau of investigation. You meyer lansky ? Drugs. Well, as I told you, there aren't any drugs. That's donnatol. That's a prescription antacid, and if you find anything else, I'll tell you what. You put it there. You people. You've been watching me so close, so long. You know, I don't touch a goddamn-- I'm a gambler. I'm a gambler, pally. I'm a common gambler. Then why are we here, sir ? Isn't that smart ? What happened to innocent until proven ? Huh ? Why are you here ? You're here because of the same reason that you go anywhere to get publicity. Get publicity. It's good copy. Interviewing meyer lansky. Who the hell do you think you are, son ? Who the hell do you think you work for ? I came here with nothing ! I served my country ! I got a son who's going to west point. What about you ? Huh ? You ? What do you do ? Son. You just tore up my home in front of my wife, you tore up our home. I know you think you're right. I know, you think you're safe. In your job. In your little niche that you found for yourself. Serving your master. You're not safe. Nobody's safe. Nobodyis safe. Your son will never go to west point. Mr. Lansky, good to see you. I come all the way from sicily to deal with this business about Benny. Hey, you know how Benny is. Charlie, c'mon. You know what it is ? I'll tell you what it is. It's cum. It's only in his balls is not what I mean. It's in his body, you see. It's in his body up to here. Up to here all the time. He can't see it's over his eyes.

They've got this broad, Virginia, running Switzerland two times a month, this vanity case. You tell me. You tell me, meyer. What's in the case ? What would you do ? You think I like it ? The flamingo hotel. It's going to be a gold mine. It opened to nothing. What did it do ? The first week it lost. It's going to be a gold mine.

And you all know how I'm going to vote, with all respect. And I mean it. Nobody's being hasty, meyer, but it was somebody else. I'm well aware of that. And we have reports of this girl flying to where ? To Switzerland, meyer. He tells me ! Me, it cost seven million dollars ? What do you want me to do, tear down the walls ? Find the builder ? What builder ever met the 'specs ? It's ridiculous, it's crazy ! You tell me what justifies another day of this ? If you say it, I'm listening. You say it's a tiger by the tail.

What is it down there ? See the ponies run. [ Master of ceremonies ] Ladies and gentlemen, the flamingo hotel proudly presents the Tom Tom Tommy review featuring the beautiful twins... So, what would have been cheaper, that or a doorknob ? Well, no, a doorknob would have been cheaper, but the question is are we getting the bang for the buck ? That's what I think. The question's gone beyond that. Uh-huh. So. You have a good time at a class picnic. That's what I'm saying. Well, look... Then give me some time. You got a month to turn it around. You little son-of-a-bitch, you. You get better looking with every passing day. You lothario, you. Listen to me, Ben. This guy, the sheik Avenue b. Who says Jews can't tap dance ? Enough, enough. You know what's at stake here ? She's got a lot of sail. What would you know, you're a fucking puritan. You know, I think you're a switched baby. Please ! Meyer, look at this. Look ! Buried up there is a three foot deep steel girder, I can't believe it ! Had to be rolled special in the mill of Indiana. Two months of lead time. I built this place, meyer, this is mine. It doesn't give you a license to steal. Meyer-- this is business. Ben. Make an appearance. Make a personal appearance. Assure US there'll be a change. Assure US Virginia is not gonna... No more quick flights to Europe. Give always reason to vote the right way. Morning, Mr. Siegel. Good morning. One month. One month. What did these guys turn into all of a sudden ? The bank. Meyer. [ Spanish ] I am now going to be passing out immigration forms, which the government of Paraguay requires from every passenger, whether or not they deplane. [ Spanish ] The problem with the passport. This passport. My client, Mr. Lansky, is seeking asylum in your country. Asylum for the reasons that I have spelled out. I'm sure that when we, if you will forgive me, reached a level sufficiently high. To allow-- what does your client do ? What ? It's a simple question. This is a simple question. Don't tell me it's a simple question. If it was-- please. [ Crying ] We wouldn't-- the teacher. It is not the teacher I have issue with. The boy is being hazed at school. Meyer, he's being hazed at school. You think that's remarkable ? He's being hazed. What is this ? You've been reading a book. That's what's happened. What ? What do you want to do tonight ? Buddy ? Excuse me a minute. Hey, dad. You going tonight ? Yeah, I'm going for a trip. Where you going ? You know. I'm going to several places on business. You know... Let me tell you something. People dislike what they do not understand. What do you think about that ? When I was a kid, I saw things, which I won't bore you with which were upsetting. Now and I'll tell you how I feel about that. You don't have to give it magical significance, you see things happen to upset you, you can look at them. You can look at them. And say that happened. Or you know what ? You can look at them and say, that happened and I'm still here. And here I am. Now, it's in the past. Now people say things about your father, your family. Be advised this happens all over the world, people don't like you because you're a Jew, you're a catholic, it doesn't make any difference. That's part of life. Now what's upsetting you is maybe they're right. Your father is a businessman. That's what I do. Now it happens that I am involved, among other things, and this is just for your benefit because our family's finances are nobody else's concern in real estate, in hotels, in entertainment. People dislike what they do not understand. They dislike what they envy. So sometimes you're just gonna have to shrug and say, "so be it." Arrest record. Arrest record. Can we start at the beginning ? Let US assume. Can you conceive of a case wherein ? No, I'm not saying in this case. I am saying let me describe a case to you. And you tell me. You tell me, is it conceivable such a case would exist ? A man was persecuted by his government. Persecuted. Senor. Not my client. Not my client. Let US say someone. Some government. Some government. A man with a grudge develops a vendetta against a citizen. And that citizen, am I saying that he's perfect, no. But I am saying. The connection between business, politics, and what we've come to know as organized crime. My client. Mr. Senator, my client-- your client has admitted. Admitted, Mr. Polakoff, knowing, knowing and consorting with. If you check your records, sir, you will not find the word admission as you call it, of consorting with-- and consorting with frank costello. Abnes willman, Charles Luciano, who seems he has just returned from visiting with-- you use the loaded word consorting, senator. If I may remind you... If you may. How, how, Mr. Polakoff, I ask you. A respected member of the bar. A light of the legal profession. I ask you. How can you, and I will speak of consorting, how can you consort with men such as this ? To defend Luciano, to defend-- yes, sir, what word was it you wanted to use, senator ? Undesirable. You know, senator, you're undesirable. Your persons of, if I may, low reputation, are just as entitled to representation as any honorable person. I don't have to apologize to you, sir. You amaze me, sir ! And you amaze me, sir. Have you read the constitution ? Gentlemen, gentlemen ! Drink ? No, thank you. You know, senator, during the war, my client-- I know all about what you did in the war. I know all about-- can I ask you something ? Sure. What's so bad about gambling ? You like to gamble like it quite a bit, I'm told. Well, you know, I may like this and I may like that. But I don't want you people to control it. Well, maybe you're confused. Maybe you confuse me with this or that Jew who comes in here and begs you to let him share the trough with you. Is that the case ? I don't take your meaning. Well, you said "you people", I assumed you meant the Jews. I did not mean the Jews. I beg your pardon, who did you mean then ? I meant someone as famous-- I understand how pleased you get, someone to pick on, huh ? Get the Jew. You're fooling no one, mister. But you have chosen the wrong man. Is that so ? Chosen the wrong man. What got your son into west point ? No, I wouldn't, get into that, in front of the committee if I were you. Don't tell me what is and is not allowed. ... and that gambling is the linchpin of the organized crime of this country. And that all their gambling operations are controlled by this man. That it is tied to loan sharking, that it funds prostitution and drugs. Senator, there's-- if I may ? And the subordination of elected officials. Now, Mr. Lansky, for example, would you tell US how in the world you have conn-- How've you gotten your son into west point ? Senator, I strongly object to the introduction-- would you share with US the source of your ability to manipulate... To control. Hold's off. How bad is that ? Two percent. Over what ? Over the last week. And so we say that's what ? What ? We would say that's attributable to what ? How you doing ? How am I doing ? I'm doing like the joint is doing, jakelah. Hell of a thing. United States of America verses meyer lansky, Jake lansky. You are hereby ordered to appear gambling, forgery, conspiracy. Operating... They got US down for everything except sinking the normandy. Hell of a thing. You know, it's the... After all, it's the goddamn predictability of the whole thing, isn't it ? Meyer, meyer. Opinion on that labor problem... I'm sure you're doing fine. The other party-- no, no, no, you handle it. A sheet of paper and an envelope, please. ♪ I know him so Here you are, Mr. Lansky. Thank you. Can I get you anything else ? No, thanks. Oh, give me a pen, will you ? Thanks. Let me have a glass of water, okay ? The captain has advised me we will be landing in Panama City in approximately twenty minutes. Please have your passports ready and remain seated until the aircraft has come to a complete stop. Worse comes to worse, you stay down here. It's hot. It's not hot in Miami. Well, the thing is, what's it gonna take ? You got a spare million, meyer ? If I had 1/10th the money they think I have. If I had 1/10th the money I should, they'd be rolling out the red carpet. You had to spare a million-- you want to sue Castro for it ? You want to sue Castro for my money ? Lookit, lookit, the feds have the hots for you, meyer. They aren't going to go away. You want to be the old wolf, keep everyone at bay. A person starts to lose his step, it's human nature. You know, I don't feel so good. What can I do ? When we get down, find a place, I'll lie down. Lie down, lie down now. He's not feeling good. You take your pill ? It's okay, it's okay. I'm in love. Is that the thing ? What happened to they're all like row boats. Turn 'em over, they're all the same. I'm in love. Oh, hell... Hey, don't nudge me, I'm doing it for you. Am I doing it for you ? Who's my landsman ? What better way to spend your time. I'm in love ! What about Joey ? Thanks for coming on such short notice. Who are you ? I'm a friend of a friend who asked me to see you about a matter which concerns him and a certain young woman. Virginia hill. That's not necessary. A certain past. And my friend wants to know your intentions towards her. I don't get you. If you're intentions are marriage, my friend is going to give you his blessings. Marriage ? Marriage ? If your intentions are marriage, he's going to give you his good will. Look, I don't want to... Let's not waste time. We're very busy men. Get me a pipe with a long enough stem and I'm gonna blow smoke up my own ass. But don't make me sit here and tell me you don't know. What don't you know ? My friend is a friend to this person. You are going to treat her right. Treat her right. If your intentions are otherwise, I can't help you. I'm just a messenger. You've had the message. I think we're done here. Nice looking woman. Not for you, pal. That's Virginia hill. I believe she's spoken for. Is that so ? Switzerland. Every two weeks, her vanity case. We don't even know what's in it. Let's cut the bullshit, meyer, what's in it is money. Where does the money come from ? The flamingo. And our friend is gone so off the deep end. Don't talk to me about loyalty. Because his loyalty is... What is he do with our 8 million dollars for a 4 million dollar hotel which at that price is obscene ? And don't tell me statue in the dessert, meyer.. Because I know how far you go back. We go back... We go back to square one. What do we do if that weren't the case, meyer ? Would we be having this meeting ? Would we be having this meeting ? I don't think so. Meyer, can we get a sense of this thing, can we get a vote ? I say we vote right now. I'm sorry, meyer. Vote. Alright. I'm going to ask for a vote on this thing. On behalf of the captain and crew, welcome to Panama. I can get that for you. What am I, an old man ? So, Panama. What's wrong with that ? A wandering Jew. You know what my father used to say ? The hill people and the valley people. Hill people and valley people always hated each other. The way of the world. We're the hill people. Is that what we are ? That's right. Conditions are tough. Gotta find an easy way. Eh ? Nomads. Come down to the valley. What do these hill people want with US ? Home is the sailor, home from the sea. What's that ? It's a poem. And the hunter home from the hill. Home from the hill. That's what i'm talking about. So how's your Panamanian ? They speak Spanish. So how's your Spanish ? How's your Spanish ? I'll learn. I'm meyer lansky. I'm the principal owner of the riviera hotel. We know who you are. [ Spanish ] The riviera will be nationalized. We don't do business with gangsters. Go home.

Income tax evasion, failure to pay taxes, your honor. The amount of... ... to pay federal income tax. The amount-- let the record show the use of the word alleged in connection with the phrase, "ownership of the flamingo hotel". Thank you. Thank you, I don't believe I used the word alleged, but if you'll allow me to control these proceedings, I think you'll find we'll all be out of here as expeditiously as possible. We need some help here. How you doing ? Feeling a little better ? Am I gonna live ? You know what ? I think so. What happened ? What happened ? You're gonna have to talk to the heavy weights. I'm just the help. You're a bad man, huh ? Is that the thing ? You got a cop at the door ? This is gonna relax you. I'll tell you a secret. I'll tell you a secret. I'm referring, sir, to Benjamin Siegel. He was a rat, wasn't he ? A what ? Rat, r-a-t. I wouldn't know. We'll he got what was coming to him, didn't he ? It was a good thing, wasn't it ? I wouldn't comment on that. Switzerland. Every two weeks for a vanity case. I'm going to ask for a vote on this thing. I'm sorry, meyer. [ Gunshots ] Mr. Lansky, this is a simple procedure. One we do many times every week. I'm going to put this mask on. What ? You got the wrong guy. The usual ? In a minute, please.And you ? Just coffee. What is the usual ? You starting already ? You ever trust a journalist ? You know what off the record means ? Means fuck you. A guy said one time, he said, we were in... Some dive. Fight brewing. One guy says, "oh, yeah... Fuck you." Other guy says, "I never thought about it quite that way." And who was that guy ? Just some fella... You know... You know... What do you remember most ? Well, my memory's conveniently fading. You get older, it's not that things disappear, it's that they get reordered according to different order of understanding. You see like a lot of things. You wait around, you get the answer. Huh ? Tongue sandwich on rye, get the rye bread burnt. Hey, Mr. L, who do we like ? Who do we like ? Why should I tell you ? Because I asked. Texas a & m. Give the points. How can I thank you ? This afternoon ? Yep. It's a history. You see, the whole thing is a history. What are you going to do ? You come here, Italians, the Jews, the blacks, one pot. What the Italians used to call jamborta. A stew. People go this way, people go that way. A little time passes, the dust settles. It becomes over and done with. You once said, we're bigger than u.S. Steel. Did I say that ? I know I was quoted as saying that. Bigger than u.S. Steel. Who was I speaking of ? The combination. Combination. Was there a combination ? Black hand. Syndicate. Hoover said none of it was real. Man was in a position to know. He left you... Unmolested for the longest time. I'm sorry, what ? Hoover. He left you alone. Oh, well, he left everyone alone. He said there was no organized crime. No mafia. It was bigger pay-off in the commie thing. He was a gambler, did you know that ? The ponies. Frank Erickson used to call from New Orleans, give frank costello the sure thing of the day. Maybe pimlico, maybe bowie... Not the best bet but the f-i-x sure thing. And costello would call Walter winchell winchell would give it to hoover. Hoover would bet a few hundred. I bet none of those commies he was locking up were giving him sure things. The appalachia. Well, a lotta guys with vowels in their names with limousines. Doing something up there in the woods that certainly attracted a lot of attention. Hoover, he called it cosa nostra. Said that the FBI uncovered it. Penetrated it. But for the longest time, the FBI treated you with... Perhaps hoover did not think me worthy of his notice. Because you see, because my role in the whole thing has been magnified out of all. Because the time came when it suited his purposes and I'll tell you why. Yes. You know why ? Because I'm a Jew. Hoover needed, mind you, the man died in '72. All the charges against me were dropped by 1976. The man needed someone non-Italian if the mafia didn't exist. So they picked... Look, I'm a gambler nothing more. That's what I am. That's what I always was. Essentially an odds maker for a pastime that people will do what you will. Always engage in. You said, bigger than u.S. Steel. We were bigger than... Let me tell you something. People will always gamble. So, now you see the governments. Huh ? The lottery. The numbers pays off six hundred-to-one. State lottery now. Get into the business. Suddenly "oh, gambling isn't so bad. They pay five hundred to one. And I'll tell you, by the turn of the century, the government, you watch, you'll have to watch because I won't be there. The government will be running not only gambling, gambling, prostitution, drugs. Why ? Because that's where the money is. That's where the money is. Do you believe that ? Sore throat, chicken soup. I'd like to talk to you for a moment about violence. You're a soldier, you were in the wars. Of course. Do you talk about it ? The cossacks are coming. You can run. Maybe you can get away. You can hide. Maybe they won't find you. You can fight. Maybe you'll win. You do what you have to do at the time. By the best lights that you have. And it's your own personality. Your own... Character. You see, environment, a little bit yes. But at an early age. An early age, who you are is who you are. And that's everyone. You want some more coffee ? You know, you ask someone who's in the jailhouse for his story, you get the jailhouse story. Murray stole, carmine stole, but I never stole. Bob killed and Mikey killed, but I never killed. It's the jailhouse tale. You ever worry ? You show me somebody who profited from it, I'd be glad to do it. What would you do if you could do it over again ? What would you do differently ? What would I do ? What would I do ? What would I do differently ? I wouldn't change a thing.
