NEW WAYS Hello? Hello. Hello! PUBLIC CENTRE FOR THE BLIND Good afternoon. I have an appointment with Sister Benedicta. She is at mass now, in the chapel. But the service will be over soon. Park over there, next to the others. Okay? Thank you. - Praised be Jesus Christ. - Good afternoon. Are you looking for someone? Can I help you? No, no, thank you. I'll manage. Let's go. You were supposed to come last week. - I couldn't... - No one has been expecting you here. - Something important cropped up. - No one's forcing you. No, of course. I'd like to thank you for your help and to apologize. Luckily, His Eminence is still here. He was supposed to go back to Warsaw. I called his office this morning. They said he was here. But he's very busy. The birds are way too high And I'm all alone, feeling bad What happened? I bumped my head. It's very dark in here. We're saving on electricity. In here, please. Please wait. Sister... - I wanted to ask you something. - I'm sorry, I've got things to do. Are you waiting here for someone? Pardon? Yes. Can I help? No, no. Thank you. Is this your first time here? Well... Yes. As a matter of fact, yes. Lovely perfume. You know about perfume, Father? You don't have to know about it to like a scent or not. It's called "Stalin's Breath". I'm joking. Chanel No.5. - Would you like a cigarette, Father? - No, no. Thank you. I don't smoke. Because it's a sin? A minor one, but still a sin. This is a sacred place, you can't smoke here. I'll do penance for it and there will be no sin. Is that right? You cannot sin and then do penance, - then sin again and do penance again. - Why not? Because it would mean the penance has not been sincere. And who cares about that? - The One you do your penance before. - Meaning? American? - Would you care for a cigarette after all? - Thank you. I've already told you that I don't smoke. I'm sorry, do you have an allergy or maybe asthma, Father? No, but I will decline anyway. You've been waiting with me here on purpose, Father, haven't you? I haven't introduced myself. I'm Father Cieciorka. I conduct religious education for adults here. I teach the history of doctrines. - Excuse me, Mrs...? - Julia Prajs. - Pardon? - Prajs, Julia Prajs. Prajs... Sounds a little like a pseudonym. I've come to meet the Primate. Well... The Primate is not certain whether he should meet you. So, you knew about my visit and have been feigning ignorance, although not too skillfully. The Primate has already agreed to this meeting. His Eminence is wondering what could have made you pay this visit. I'll not confess to you. - Have you got proof? - Proof of what? - Proof of identity. Your ID. - What for? We must be sure you are who you say you are. - Here. - Sister! Please take this lady's ID and read it out loud. I've come to meet the Primate. The Primate will make a decision only after our recommendation. State Publishing Institute in Warsaw, 17 Foksal Street. Official ID card. Julia Prajs, born on 25 November 1902 in Stryj, in the USSR. Employed at the State Publishing Institute in Warsaw as senior editor since 16 May 1957. - That is not your real ID. - But it confirms my identity. Do you also want to know my marital status, height, eye color, - number of dependent children? - Ma'am. Only a national ID states correct data. The Primate knows very well who I am. I've met him many times. Why do you want to see His Eminence now? I can only tell him that. His Eminence is not sure if you are the same person he met previously. I asked Sister to help me organize the meeting. - And I have complied with your request. - You told me the Primate had agreed to it. He agreed to your coming to Górki. That's not the same thing. Has someone encouraged you to meet the Primate? Who? Why? Do you maintain contact with your former superiors? Most of my former superiors have already retired. But are you still in touch with them? Very superficially. Unfortunately, you are not being honest with us. If you already know everything about me, why this interrogation? Have you been blind from birth, or did you lose your eyesight in some accident? Have you ever received psychiatric treatment? Pardon? A lot of people thought you were a psychopath, a perverted person. You were a sadist. Did you have an accident, Father? - Answer my questions. - You're not answering mine. We are not in the headquarters of the secret service but in a church. And that gives you the right to interrogate me? Yes. The difference being that we don't use torture here. What impudence! I'll not talk to this arrogant Holy Joe. Well, never mind. We're not forcing anyone to do anything. Sister will see you to the gate. I'm sorry, Father. I'm sorry, I lost my temper... I shouldn't have... But... But this isn't as easy as you think... No one's ever asked me such questions. Some of your former superiors have been arrested. Why haven't you? - What for? - You used to be known as "Bloody Luna". Allegedly. Do you not feel guilty? What I feel is one thing, and what I'm being accused of is another. I was talking about your conscience. Conscience! What a word! Such a word exists. Maybe you don't use it, but we use it here. It's complicated. Undoubtedly. I don't know if I can... Maybe it's worth giving it a try? Well, no, no! This doesn't make sense. A pity. Wait a moment, wait a moment! Wait a moment, Father. All right. All right. All right. I'm a Jew. I mean, I was born a Jew, although my family was not religious. I have never believed in God, at least not the one depicted in Christianity or Judaism. I studied philosophy; I know all the evidence for and against. I'm an atheist. Well, let's say, an agnostic. From my early youth I was an ardent communist. I went to prison. But... But... I think I understood too late that... the world was not as straightforward as I thought it was. I was blind. These are the ringleaders, Comrade Colonel. Name. Jesus Christ. Not your pseudonym. Your real name. Son of Joseph and Mary. Date of birth. Bethlehem, 42nd year of the rule of Caesar Augustus. - Do you know why you're here? - To die. Right, you are. But before you die, you fucking fascist scum, you'll tell us all about the structure of your organization, the names of your accomplices and those who gave you orders! Are you ready to receive your punishment now? What punishment? One dictated by the law. Go to prison? I mean the divine law. Which is what? Hell? Being boiled in tar? - You've committed the cruelest of crimes. - Yes, but... only a court of law may judge that. People you had arrested were tortured and murdered without a court hearing. - Yes, but that was... - You were a director of a department whose main objective was fighting the Church, secularization, and the elimination of enemies of the system. But I'm a different person now. God bless you. What now? The Primate definitely won't see you today. It's vespers soon. And then completorium. Then I am going back to Warsaw. His Eminence gets up early and might find time to see you tomorrow, after matins. We have guest rooms. You can stay here for the night. No, I'm not prepared to stay somewhere overnight. You said that you really wanted this meeting. That's true. But I didn't know I'd be put through such a humiliating process first, be interrogated by a blind priest putting on some sort of act, pretending not to know who I was, asking blunt questions. Insulting me. Did you treat people better? Why wouldn't that priest tell me how he lost his sight? - He doesn't like to talk about it. - Do you know, Sister? - I do. - So? The Cracow Curia trial in 1953. - Spying for the United States... - Yes, yes... I know about it. Father was completely innocent, as was everyone else. He got eight years, released after five. They burnt out his eyes with cigarettes during the interrogation. One held his head, another forced his eyes open, a third did the burning. Who was the interrogator? Różański? I don't know. But certainly one of your colleagues from the "department". Here you are. The bathroom is at the end of the corridor. The duty sister will bring you a towel. Sister. I feel like you are treating me like an enemy. No one is treated like an enemy here. Our door is open to everyone. In accordance with the teachings of our Lord, Jesus Christ. I can feel I'm not welcome here. What do you expect from us? Sympathy, compassion? Understanding. An understanding of the path I've been on. We'll meet at supper. How long have you got left to serve? Five years. You might be out soon. You can return to your order. If you sign. - Am I to inform on people? - You'll be working for us. For the homeland you allegedly love so much. This way you can atone somewhat for your guilt. But, how am I... You'll keep a journal in the place you are transferred to. You'll record everything that happens. Every detail, every word he utters, every gesture. Whose words? You'll find out in due course. Secret. Source: "Kalemba". Recorded by Captain Jay Głuszczak. Third Department. Report. On 25 May 1962, the following vehicles arrived at the facility codenamed "Cobra". Around 9:02 a.m. a Mercedes passenger car, black, with the diplomatic number plate WZ 1198. The passengers were a bishop and a middle-aged man. At 1:32 p.m., a Moskvich car arrived, pale grey, number plate WE 4513. The car was driven by a woman aged between 55 to 60. An enquiry has been sent to the Transport Department in order to determine the owners of the above vehicles. Mr. Antoni Marylski is the co-founder and manager of our center. I know everything about him. - This is Julia. - Nice to meet you. Likewise. I'll ask Sister to serve supper. You are interested in French philosophy, Jacques Maritain, aren't you? I also studied at the Sorbonne. I heard that you also used to model for Picasso? I posed for him once or twice. I heard that you've maintained personal contact with Jacques Maritain and his wife? I've had that honor. I'm sorry, we'll definitely have a chance to talk about it... But now, duty calls. Please, sit down. - Thank you. - Supper will be served shortly. - Praised be Jesus Christ. - Good evening. - Enjoy your meal. - Thank you. - You don't like it? - Pardon? No... I just don't usually eat such things. Are you a vegetarian? No, I eat meat. There's no meat in this, anyway. It's just too fatty for me. - On a diet? - Well, yes... actually, yes. Then you must ask the sister. She will certainly find you some cottage cheese. No, I'm not hungry. Bread and tea will be enough. Excuse me, haven't we met somewhere before? I don't think so... I don't think we have. I haven't introduced myself, I'm sorry... I'm Kościukiewiczowa. First married name, Knauff. Maiden name, Jasińska. Nice to meet you. Jadwiga Dubiela. And your maiden name, if I may ask? I'm not married. Wasn't it in Saint Jacob's Parish in Narutowicz Square? A retreat in which His Excellency Archbishop took part. Last year... No, definitely not. I live near Warsaw, in Legionowo. I don't go to Ochota. I could have sworn blind that we've met before. Excuse me, I think I'll go for a walk. Goodnight. Fuckers... Excuse me, is there a garage nearby? One that will repair a puncture? Yes, in Lutowice. Five kilometers from here. But no one will be there at this time of night. Can I use your phone? - Where do you want to call? - Warsaw. Something has conked out at the exchange. No external calls at all. Well, is there another phone near here? - There is, at the Communal Inn. - Where is that? A bit from here. You have to go along this wall. Turn left at the corner, then the first road right... Thank you. But they don't let you make calls from there. Gatehouse. Good evening. Have you got a phone here? - No. - I need to make an important call. - You're late. - Am I? What for? The funeral. Franciszek has already been buried. May he rest in peace. - Everyone has already left. - No, I'm not here for the funeral. - I thought you used to know him. - I never met him. Nevertheless, please join us for some refreshments. No, no. Thank you. - Really, please join us. - Thank you. A shot of vodka, please. - A single? Or a double? - A single. No, a double, please. - Anything with it? - No, thank you. - We don't sell alcohol without a snack. - So, what have you got? There is pickled herring, but I wouldn't recommend it. Something else, then? We have vegetarian stewed cabbage with a bread roll, or kidneys... But I wouldn't recommend the kidneys either. - The stewed cabbage then. - That'll be 28.60. There you are. Keep the change. - But it's a bit too... - It's okay, thank you. But not too long. The exchange will come on. Thank you... Hello? Hello, exchange? Warsaw 49822, please. Okay, I'll wait. Oh, good, I managed to catch you. I have a serious problem. I'm near Warsaw, in Górki, at the center for the blind. Do you know where it is? Someone punctured my tires. Two of them, front and rear... How long before you get here? - ID, citizen. - Wait a moment. Here. Now, I'm in this bar... What's the name of this street? Leave the private chit-chat, citizen. You're talking to an officer on duty. Wait, I'll call you back in a moment. - Name. - Maria Kot. - Place of residence? - Can't you see? It says it right there. What I can see is my business. Place of residence? Eight, Litewska Street, apartment eight. Warsaw, of course. Date and place of birth. 25 November 1902, in Stryj. That's not right, you are lying. Ah, sorry. 26 October 1905 in Zamość. Maiden name Kopeć, father Wincenty, mother Eulalia, maiden name Zasławska. Are you trying to mislead the authorities? Can't you remember your personal data? Maybe you've stolen this ID from someone? If we put you away for 48 hours you'd even remember your grandad's shoe size. Breathe out. I detect the consumption of alcoholic beverages. You qualify for the detoxification detention center. - Rubbish. - Rubbish? - Watch your tongue, citizen. - It's not true. I'm sober. Watch what you're saying, or I'll slap you so hard you won't get up again. - How loutish... - Insulting a functionary on duty. A hooligan, isn't she? Undertake measures? - Absolutely. - Hands. Clean. Be careful next time, citizen. Would you like to make that phone call? No, no. I'll have the stewed cabbage first, please. It's very good. My wife made it at home. Death to Ruski lackeys and butchers! No, no, thank you. For Franek. You won't have a drink for Franek? He was a hero. He fought at Monte Casino, and they murdered him like a dog. Uncle, leave the lady alone. Come back to us. Where did they murder him? When? - Come back to us. - Leave it... Didn't you see how the communists treated her? The same as us, like scum. In Rawicz. They murdered him in Rawicz prison. I mean, they released him a few years ago, but without a kidney, without a lung, without teeth... For the peace of his soul. Bottoms up! - And death to communism! - Uncle, someone will hear you... Whatever, let them hear! Bottoms up! Bottoms up! Whose side are you on? Theirs or ours? You are an okay woman! - Uncle, please, we have... - And death to communism! We have enough trouble as it is. Praised be Jesus Christ. You should be more careful. It could hurt someone. There are suspicious characters about. Poor weather for a walk, isn't it? - What do you want from me? - Me? Why are you following me? I just wanted to walk you back. Women are afraid of walking in the dark. I'll manage. God bless you! Oh, fuck... You know that I can let you go, but that I can also order you killed. Julia... - Where am I? - It's already after matins. The Primate may be able to see you now. I'll be ready in five minutes. Good morning. Leave. THE IMITATION OF CHRIST Take a photo of this. CHRIST'S SCHOOL - What is it? - Blood. A cilice. It's worn for repentance. Doesn't he experience enough discomfort here? Idiot. Good morning. I'm sorry... I thought it was the Cardinal. And it's me. I'm actually glad to see you. Please tell His Eminence that I no longer wish to meet him. Please apologize to him on my behalf and give him my regards, of course. I'll write him a letter. It's a pity. The Primate had just decided to see you. No, no. I'm sorry, but no. I've had enough of the endless waiting. I'm not used to such treatment. I'm going back to Warsaw. You got scared. Me? What of? Yourself. How perceptive of you. You'd make a good investigative officer. Just like you'd make a good servant of God. Me? Why did you come here? Please, leave me alone. I know why you have an aversion to cigarettes, Father. The way you were treated was... What they did to you, Father, it was a great injustice. It was nothing less than a crime! What organization do you belong to? - The organization of free people. - What are your objectives? - To promote the truth. - How banal. - For us, the truth is not banal. - What truth? Which truth? - There are many truths. - There is only one truth. - Which truth is it? - You know very well which. - Why are you pretending? - Me? You pretend to yourself, but you hold the same beliefs that I do. - I don't believe in anything. - That's not true. Shut up, you son of a bitch! Quiet! I know everything about you. Be careful. I can kill you, and in a very painful way, too. - What are you doing? - You wanted me to get undressed. You asshole, you shitty thug, you scum! - Deal with him. - Yes, ma'am. With whom? Sister Gaudentia, maiden name Goldman, buried here. Sister Hyacinth, maiden name Helena Krantz. Sister Bonifatia, born as Bronisława Krakower, a very good pediatrician. Sister Veronica, maiden name Laude, a painter and a poet. Jewish women. Converted before the war by Father Korniłowicz. They came to believe that Christianity was a natural extension to Judaism. He knew how to do it. And you, Sister, how... You wouldn't understand. You don't believe in anything anyway. Excuse me, I have things to do. I'll see you at supper. - Praised be Jesus Christ. - Stop trailing behind me. - Me? - Secret collaborator, codename "Las". You don't have to put on a show for my benefit. Your case officer is Captain Głuszczak from Department Three. What? I don't know anything. Your father used to be in Home Army, he got life. He was released after agreeing to cooperate with the secret police. You followed in his footsteps. You've been in our service for a long time. - I don't... no... - I've seen your file. There are some interesting things in it. But I don't know anything. Why are you following me? What do you want to know about me? Maybe you're interested in Thomistic philosophy? - Jacques Maritain? What? - I don't understand... Don't be afraid. I won't hurt you. Thank you. And, by the way, I'd be careful about that Sister Benedicta if I were you. Because her real name is Miriam Szwarcman. She's Jewish. So what? - You'd better keep an eye on her. - Because? In the event of any disorder, the Jews will take up arms against Poland. They'll support the USA and Israel. They'll murder us Poles. Those minders of yours are putting some ripe old nonsense into your head. The security authorities didn't used to be overrun with anti-Semites. Because they were Jew-ridden. Listen, you fucking bastard. Tell your anti-Semite superiors that if the secret police start to butt into my life, they will regret it. I have hidden the original documents from former Department Five in a safe place, abroad. In Paris. If I were to be arrested, they would be made public immediately. At just the push of a button. It could be seriously damaging to some high-ranking comrades. Write everything I've said in your report, word for word. Now you can fuck off, you prick, and if I see you here again - you'll be sorry you were ever born. - Why be so harsh? I'll pass on everything, of course I will. I'll pass on. Button. - Is this the one? - Yes. - Can he testify? - He won't last long. Give him an injection to boost his strength. Won't work. Listen carefully. The Public Prosecutor's Office is conducting an investigation concerning the use of prohibited investigative methods by some state security functionaries. Tell me, has this citizen present here used prohibited investigative methods on you? Have you been beaten by her, brutally interrogated? Yes. I accept the blame. I beat him, I tortured him. Do you understand the question? Has this person present here interrogated you? I tormented him... Mistreated him. Did she torment you? Did she mistreat you? Yes. I mistreated him. Do you recognize her or not? Have a good look, citizen! I hate everybody. Everybody. And myself... Myself most of all. But you can confirm that you were tortured during the investigation carried out by this functionary here? Eli... Eli... Lama Sabachthani... Speak clearly! What do you mean, for fuck's sake? Comrade Prosecutor, leave it. He's talking nonsense, he's raving. He's lost his mind. He's already... kaput. Comrade Brystiger. Follow me. I shouldn't be telling you this, but... He's our only witness. The others are either dead or in an even worse condition. But he didn't recognize you. He said something about beating, about prohibited investigative methods. Conclusion, the accusations against you are groundless. There are no grounds to initiate an investigation in this case. His Kingdom is not of this world... What kingdom? What do you mean? No, nothing, nothing... We'll draw up the minutes from this interview. We'll present the results to the Commission of the Central Committee. You won't be subjected to any more interrogations on this matter. Goodbye. Colonel! Are you all right? Comrade Brystiger! Can you hear me? Call a doctor! Oh, you're moving, you're alive! Yes, I'm alive. What's your name? What's yours? - Mine? Julia. - My name's Julia, too. It's not a very fashionable name nowadays. - And how old are you? - How old are you? Fifty-nine. But don't tell me that's how old you are too. I'm nine. - I was nine once, you know. - I know. - You're clever. - And are you clever? Me? I don't know... I don't think so. If you were stupid you wouldn't say that you weren't clever. I was clever when I was nine. And later? And later... I was possessed by... a demon, a dybbuk. An evil force. And now you're bad? No. - It's the dybbuk that's bad. - Then drive it away. How? You've got to say a spell. I don't know any spells. You know them, you've just forgotten. How do I remember them? I have to go. Zyzol is calling me to supper. I still have problems sleeping, despite the pills. Besides that, palpitations, anxiety attacks, something choking me, and every now and then I get drenched in sweat. That's normal at your age. But the ECG is normal, no change whatsoever. Blood count is normal. X-ray is clean. We won't keep you here any longer. There's no need. She can be discharged tomorrow. You must look after yourself. I would advise giving up smoking. I'm sure I'll not see you in our hospital as a patient again. I'll do my best, Professor. Thank you. - Have they gone yet? - They have. Yes. Can you read to me, daughter? - At home, my son reads to me. - What do you want me to read? Here, under the tabletop, wrapped up in newspaper... The gospel according to St. Matthew. Chapter 27. From verse 45. "Now from the sixth hour there was darkness." From there? "Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour. And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, 'Eli, Eli, Lama Sabachthani?' That is to say, 'My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?'" - Keep reading, keep reading. - "Some of them that stood there, when they heard that, said, 'This man calleth for Elias.' And straightway one of them took a sponge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave it to him to drink. The rest said, 'Let be, let us see whether Elias will come to save him.' Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost... Is this funny to you? Yes, daughter, because when Lord Jesus died, he saved us. Without it, we would all have been damned. "Now, when the centurion... and they that were with him, watching Jesus, saw the earthquake, and those things that were done, they feared greatly, saying, 'Truly this was the Son of God...'" "...was the Son of God. And many women were there." Miriam? Miriam? Szwartzkopf... Szwarcman? - Miriam Szwarcman. - Sister Benedicta now. The literary club in the Szkocka Café in Lvov, remember? We were so young. And what, the poet has become a nun? You used to be a teacher. I no longer work in the Ministry. I've been a private person for a few years now. Oh, yes, otherwise you would've been in the Government clinic. How did it happen? A muse to poets, and a Jewess to boot, enters a convent? Why? It's difficult to explain in a single sentence. Right. And so... are you happy now? I'm asking seriously. You wouldn't understand. You deal with earthly, material life. I have devoted my life to God. That's what I meant. Are you... Are you happy now, Sister? Can you smell the forest? I love mornings like this. - Praised be Jesus Christ. - Forever and ever, amen. Are all the girls washed? Have you rinsed your face well? Now your turn, sweetie. Bozenka, I'll comb your hair. And you, ready? - Hands washed? - Yes. - Teeth? - Yes. This is the most difficult part of the day. Not enough hands to help. Have you finished washing, darling? Maybe I can wipe your face? - Bozenka, come here. - Which one is your toothbrush? This one here? - I'm calling you, Bozenka. - Will you do it yourself? I've done a poo! Wait, Zuzia, I'll deal with you in a minute. I can't right now. Maybe I can help. Come on, Zuzia. I'll wash and change you, okay? Come on, darling. "...here is a grain of barley", said Yevdokiya the Witch, "but this is not an ordinary grain they sow in the field. Plant it in a flowerpot and you'll see what happens." "Thank you", said Matryosha, and paid Yevdokiya ten kopecks. She returned home, planted it in a flowerpot, and a small plant appeared immediately, covered in green leaves. It sprouted a red and gold flower. It looked like a tulip, but in a bud. Matryosha was so delighted that she kissed the red and gold petals. And, suddenly, the flower opened with a slight crack and in the middle was standing a beautiful little girl. She had golden hair, eyes blue like the sky. Maybe a bit like Zuzia's. Am I talking about colors too much? - It's very good, they understand a lot. - But how? Miss, what are kopecks? Kopecks are Russian money, because this is a Russian fairy tale. We know this fairy tale, it's called Thumbelina! So what, don't you want me to tell it, if you know it? No! Tell us! I've lost track of the plot. I don't think I can tell stories to children. What about to your own children? My son is all grown up now. We have to go. Maybe the Primate can see you now. Bye for now, Zuzia, someone is waiting for me. - Not yet! - Not yet! You disgusting little brat! - You! - What are you doing? - Will you come back? - Pardon? - My name is Szymon. - Yes? - What's yours? - I'm Julia. You made me wait a long time for you, comrade. Go! Mama! Mama! Mama! Wait! Forgive me. Good afternoon. I'm sorry, I fell asleep. I waited so long. I'm sorry. I was held up by unforeseen circumstances. No, no, I'm sorry. I asked you for the appointment. I've been very tired lately. I can't sleep at night at all. But during the day I collapse suddenly. Thank you... Thank you for agreeing to see me, Father. It is really important to me. I really want to tell you that... I mean... I wanted to explain some things because... I'm sorry, I'm confused. I had everything so carefully planned, but... I'm sorry. I'm blank. We've met before. I don't know if you'll remember, Father. The first time was in 1949. In the Primate's House on Szucha Avenue. Maria Okońska arranged the meeting. Yes, I remember. It was on Good Friday, at the hour of Jesus Christ's death upon the cross. - It was a very important meeting for me. - Was it? I'm sorry. I've often thought about the things you told me that day, Father... But you didn't change, did you? I wasn't ready to at the time. I gave you the Gospel according to St. Matthew as a goodbye gift. Yes. I read it often, but... I kept wondering... why you chose that particular Gospel for me, Father? I don't understand... You read the God's Word and then returned to your... practices? We met one more time after that, in a larger group at the session of the Mixed Commission of the Episcopate and the Government. I wanted to warn you then to be more reserved in your statements. Because the Politburo was even considering your physical liquidation. Did you support that? No, I was against it. Thank you. You are joking and I am speaking seriously. The physical liquidation of the Primate of Poland would have been a huge mistake politically. It could have led to riots, to an attempt to overthrow the people's government in Poland. I understand. You were stopped by practical reasons, not ethical ones. Yes? Yes, practicality was more important than morality at that time. - But you didn't warn me. - It would've been futile. I knew that you would do everything your own way, regardless of the consequences. I must say that in a way, I was impressed. During that meeting you said that the Government had to have full control over the clergy who held any sort of function in the Church. That the reactionary part of the clergy had to be isolated from the masses, as you put it, from the bottom layers of the clergy who did not want a political conflict with the Government. I got the impression that you were a dangerous fanatic. A person devoid of emotion, like Dzierżyński, Jagoda, Beria. I'm sorry. I've never said such things to anyone. I've heard worse things said about me. - I know that I wasn't... nice. - Nice? But my main task in the Ministry was the fight against religious organizations, against the clergy. Well, I could never have agreed to what you were demanding from me at the time. Even if it cost me my life. Non possumus. It was a crafty move. It put us against the wall. We had to respond, against public opinion, of course. As a result, you came out a hero. We looked like tyrants. I hope the smoke isn't bothering you, Father? It does not bother me, but this is a chapel. - A consecrated place. - I'm sorry. But I would like to... I would like to explain, so there's nothing oblique, no ambiguity between us, particularly with regard to my role in your imprisonment. By that time I no longer made decisions concerning the Church. I had been transferred to other tasks. The Politburo probably sensed that my attitude to the Church was changing, that I was becoming... indecisive. That's what I think now. Several times I expressed doubts about Bierut's decisions. A process started within me. All this was very complicated, of course, the result of thousands of factors. I don't think I'll be able to explain it clearly or convincingly. But maybe you want to ask me about something, because it's just been me speaking so far? You asked me for the meeting. I don't have any questions. Well, yes, but I wanted to explain why I had been so persistent in seeking this meeting. An ardent communist, a Jew, a persecutor of religion and the clergy, a sadist, a criminal, suddenly wants a private meeting with the Primate of Poland. - I'd wonder why. - Yes, why? I don't know, but I felt I had to. Even though, as you've said, after our first meeting I went back to the Ministry and kept on doing the same things. But now I think that this is where it all began. - The true breakthrough came later. - What influenced it? - I had so many doubts, so many questions. - What questions? Well, for example... For example, I understood... that the ideology we used to justify our actions was based on a false premise, on a monstrous lie, it was compromised. So, because we had honorable intentions, good objectives, it was the system that was to blame. You only found out about those millions of victims from Krushchev's speech? No, no, no. I knew about them earlier, but I thought, "They are the enemy, they have to be destroyed in order for us to build a new, better world." At university you read... Saint Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, Maritain. How is it possible that with such knowledge you could persecute people because they thought differently? The clergy, the Catholic Church? There were others who appealed to me more. La Mettrie, Saint-Just, Engels, Santayana... Santayana spent the last ten years of his life in a monastery, even though earlier he had believed himself to be an atheist. But many Catholic philosophers, and even priests denounced God in old age and died atheists. Yes, that's true, it can also happen that way. Why does it happen? Tell me, Father, why do people change their views? You are asking me? I have never changed my views. Of course, they've undergone a significant evolution, they have developed and deepened. But my attitude towards the world has not changed. Your beliefs are the same, Father? Are you under threat of arrest or trial by any chance? Do you need spiritual support? The support of one of your victims? I still don't know what you want from me. Can I become someone else? In what sense? You know who I am, what I've done, what they are accusing me of. Is it possible for me, given what I was, to become someone else? A better, more moral person? Is this what this is about? Let's say it is. God doesn't reject anyone, not even sinners. But is change, renewal, possible without faith in God? You've never believed? As a little girl I believed in fairies, elves, dybbuks... But in God, in the sense that is understood by Christianity? - No. - So why have you come here? How am I to live now? Even if I wanted very much to believe in God, I can't. Well... my presence here is unnecessary, I believe. You priests care only about those who believe the same things you do! And the rest? Let them die a rotten death, let them go to hell! You don't care about man, - only about rattling off your prayers! - You are wrong. I really would like to help you but you won't let me. I won't let you? It's you who won't help me! Why did you come here? To humiliate me, to torment me? I came because you asked. I had my doubts. I didn't want to meet you. Sister Benedicta spoke for you. So you reject people like me? You can't reject those who hate God because they are looking for Him. That hatred encompasses fear, the acceptance of power. People who hate God work for His glory without knowing it. Hatred conceals faith. I hate, therefore I believe? Yes. But... if someone does not believe in God, well, they simply don't believe, so how can they then start believing? You've to give yourself up to Him completely. So... you've to assume first that God exists after all. Yes? If you are not graced by enlightenment... yes, you have to make such an assumption. So I have not been graced through faith... It's possible, not everybody attains it. So what am I supposed to do? I don't know... You are wise, Father, you know what must be done! Me, wise? I'm stupid. It's God who is wise. But God does not exist! - Are you certain of that? - Yes! No. No, I don't know anything. I'm not certain of anything anymore. You are frightened, aren't you? Me? Of what? People's eternal damnation of you. You find it hard to live with. God will forgive you but it's possible that people will never forgive you. If I... If I believed, would God help me? Listen... You are not the person you used to be. But you are not yet the person you want to become. I have no one to tell all this to... You'll be lonely until you find what you're looking for. And what am I looking for? When you finally find it, you'll recognize it for what it is. You know, Father, you're only pretending not to know. And maybe it's you who's pretending? You don't want to admit to yourself that your perspective on life has fallen apart. You're defending yourself against it. The sooner you accept this, the less painful it will be. But it's all emptiness, there's nothing there... You are wrong. What you are looking for is there. - Only you don't know how to look. - How? I can't... I can't... Are you praying? You must first believe in order to pray. Not necessarily. I, for example, pray. After so many years in the convent you have doubts, Sister? The more you think about God, the greater the doubts. Dante Alighieri's Ninth Circle of Hell. Where did this come from? The Primate must have left it for me... A strange gift. - As if I know nothing about hell. - But you don't believe in hell. I was speaking metaphorically. I'm going for a walk. God is also a metaphor. Praised be Jesus Christ. - Walking at this time, on your own? - Yes, on my own. - It's not safe here. - Please, leave me alone. I hope you'll forgive me. I didn't want to hurt you, I really didn't. You liked it when people suffered. Yes. You hated everyone. Your parents, your husband, your child, your friends. That's why you were always lonely. No one loved me. They desired me, but they didn't love me. You want to be pitied? God will forgive me. - But you don't believe in Him. - I'll believe. - How? - I'll be baptised, take Communion... On the inside, you'll remain as you were before. I'll atone. Try. It hurts! Shit! - Is it helping? - Yes. No... no. Shit. Imagine that this pain will remain with you until the end of your days. God... Fuck... if you exist... I can't stand this! Chanel No. 5. Good morning. Praised be Jesus Christ. I've been looking for you everywhere. I'm leaving. I wanted to say goodbye. May I? I'll just be a moment. I wanted to ask you something. - Praised be Jesus Christ. - Thank you, I'm not eating anything. Have some tea at least. Thank you very much, Sister. It was a very interesting conversation that we had. Not pleasant for me, I admit. But thanks to you I realized a few important things, Father. The Primate chose you specifically to talk to me, didn't he? To humiliate me, to increase my guilt? No, madam. The Primate gave that task to Sister Benedicta. It was me who asked His Eminence to let me talk to you. Why? I wanted to meet you. I thought that maybe it would help me understand... what happened to make a normal person capable of something like that. And so, did you understand why I was like that, Father? No, I didn't. God bless you. - Praised be Jesus Christ. - Forever and ever, amen. Do you know him well, Sister? Marian? He's worked for us for years. He's actually an agent for the secret police. - Be careful around him. - That's impossible, Marian goes to confession regularly and takes communion once a week. I know his wife and children. He's a decent man. He is informing on you. You have a twisted picture of reality. But you are safe here. You are naive, Sister. But I'm not surprised. Belief in God gives you such a false sense of security. But I don't believe. Well, he sorted out the tires, he's a decent man after all. You can rely on him. And he moved the car as well. Wait, Sister... There you are. What's this? "Julia Prajs' Crooked Letters." - Prose? - Yes, a novel. You published it under your maiden name? - Otherwise no one would read it. - God bless you. Thank you. Thank you, Miriam, for... helping me organize the meeting. So, did you... Did you learn something important from His Eminence? Yes... Although... - I expected something else. - What? I don't know... A shock. The world coming to a standstill. Gilgul? Yes. In Kabbalah it means revival, reincarnation. Somewhere deep down we'll always be Jewish. So what? Visit us again, Julia. It'll make the children happy. God bless you. Top secret. Inspector of the 3rd Division of Department Three of the Ministry of Interior, Major Cz. Szewczyk. Decision to set up an investigation-observation file, operational codename "Egoist" for Brystiger, Julia, daughter of Henryk, born on the 25th of November 1902 in Stryj, USSR, nickname "Roxana". Within the premises of the target codename "Cobra”, the subject was in contact with Marylski, Antoni, son of Antoni, conducting espionage for the capitalist bloc countries. In the near future I am planning firstly, bug installation in the subject's place of residence, secondly, reinstate phone tapping...
